ms.
ruth
v.
iles
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
appearing
in
support
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
which
are
here
challenged.
mr.
crary,
the
state
university
counsel
will
argue
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
state
university
and
the
procedures
adopted
by
it
to
implement
these
statutes.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
case
that
the
constitutionality
of
these
statutes,
the
feinberg
law
that
is
education
law
section
3022
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
adler
case
and
that
there
have
been
no
changes
in
the
law
since
that
case
which
would
warrant
a
different
decision
here.
the
feinberg
law
was
first
enacted
in
1949
to
eliminate
from
the
states
public
school
system
as
teachers,
persons
willfully
and
deliberately
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
such
persons
were
already
ineligible
for
service
in
the
public
--
in
the
state
employment
but
the
feinberg
law
was
intended
to
implement
the
disqualification
under
civil
service
section
12-a
which
had
been
on
the
book
since
1939
by
providing
procedures
whereby
the
public
school
teachers
and
the
board
of
regents
would
implement
section
12-a
of
the
civil
service
law.
the
only
change
in
the
feinberg
law
since
1949
and
since
the
adler
case
has
been
the
fact
that
now
instead
of
just
public
school
teachers
being
covered
employees
of
the
state
university
institutions
of
higher
education
of
the
state
had
been
covered
in
and
a
requirement
has
been
added
that
the
board
of
regents
report
annually
to
the
legislature
in
the
effectiveness
of
the
act.
civil
service
law
section
12-a
has
been
amended
once
since
the
adler
case,
that
was
in
1958
when
they
added
to
section
12-a,
a
provision
that
membership
in
the
communist
party
would
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
disqualification
for
state
service.
the
only
other
change
in
section
12-a
is
that
in
a
general
recodification
of
the
civil
service
law
in
1958,
section
12-a
of
the
civil
service
law
was
renumbered
as
subdivisions
1
and
2
of
section
105
of
that
law.
appellants
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
ruling
in
the
adler
case
seek
to
make
this
case
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
every
statute
ever
enacted
in
the
state
of
new
york
having
to
do
with
subversive
activity.
for
example,
they
challenge
the
language
of
section
160
and
161
of
the
penal
law
relating
to
criminal
anarchy
but
this
is
not
a
prosecution
for
criminal
anarchy.
what's
more,
those
sections
have
been
repealed
by
a
general
revision
of
the
new
york
state
penal
law
and
effective
in
1967
they
will
no
longer
be
the
law
of
new
york
state.
appellants
also
challenged
the
language
of
civil
service
law
section
105
subdivision
3
relating
to
removal
from
public
office
for
sedition.
but
this
is
not
a
charge
of
sedition
and
these
persons
have
not
been
charged
with
treasonable
or
seditious
acts
or
words.
section
--
subdivision
3
of
section
105
was
formally
subdivision,
was
formally
section
23-a
of
the
civil
service
law
has
been
on
the
books
a
long
time
was
on
the
books
when
the
adler
case
was
decided
and
is
not
new
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
feinberg
law
and
the
rules
of
the
board
of
regents
however
continue
to
refer
only
to
civil
service
section
12-a
or
subdivisions
1
and
2
of
civil
service
law
section
105.
these
relate
only
to
the
disqualification
of
persons
for
service
in
the
state
service
for
advocating
deliberately
and
willfully
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force.
we
are
concerned
here
only
with
the
hiring
of
personnel
of
the
state
university
of
new
york
and
whether
they
are
qualified
or
not
and
we
contend
that
subdivisions
1
and
2
of
that
section
are
the
only
ones
with
which
we
are
here
concerned.
thus,
our
inquiry
is
only
whether
a
state
statute
may
disqualify
a
person
for
employment
in
a
state
college
if
he
deliberately
and
willfully
advocates
the
overthrow
of
our
government
by
force
and
violence
which
is
all
that
the
feinberg
law
in
section
12-a
do
as
far
as
these
persons
are
concerned.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
contend
that
it's
not
relevant.
on
page
16
of
my
brief
in
a
footnote,
you
will
see
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
these
--
there
has
been
a
general
revision
of
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
sections
160
and
161
have
been
repealed
effective
in
1967
and
there
will
be
a
new
provision
relating
to
criminal
anarchy
with
an
entirely
different
definition
as
of
them.
the
definition
is
in
the
footnote
on
the
bottom
of
page
16
of
the
brief.
for
this
reason,
i
feel
that
in
interpreting,
i
don't
feel
that
subdivision
3
of
section
105
of
the
civil
service
law
is
pertinent
but
certainly
even
if
it
is
pertinent,
it
seems
to
me
since
it
relates
to
the
removal
of
the
persons
for
sedition,
it
would
be
something
which
this
court
would
abstain
from
deciding
under
the
course
of
new
york
have
interpreted
these
new
sections
and
it
would
certainly
seem
premature
here
where
no
such
question
is
involved
in
the
controversy.
as
i
say
--
said,
all
we
are
concern
with
is
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
state
statute
may
disqualify
a
person
for
employment
if
he
deliberately
and
willfully
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force.
this
is
exactly
the
same
question
which
was
decided
in
the
adler
case
where
this
court
held
that
a
person
may
be
denied
the
privilege
of
working
for
the
school
system
of
the
state
of
new
york
if
he
advocates
unlawful
overthrow
of
the
government.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
in
the
adler
case,
in
construing
this
section
of
the
law
which
i
might
add
as
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
adler
case,
this
court
said
they
would
rely
upon
the
construction
placed
upon
that
section
by
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
said
that
it
had
to
be
knowing
membership
in
the
organization
but
the
person
must
not
only
know
it,
he
must
know
its
aims
and
purposes
and
they
interpreted
its
meaning
that
the
person
subscribe
to
it
and
that
if
a
person
was
a
member
and
could
explain
his
membership,
he
would
not
be
disqualified.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
no.
in
the
adler
case,
they
said
it
had
to
be
â€˜knowing
membership'
--
knowing
the
aims
of
the
organization.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
then
there
is
a
hearing
to
see
--
under
the
adler
case
it
said,
he
would
then
be
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
whether
he
had
ever
been
a
member,
whether
he
was
now
a
member.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
well,
implicit
in
section
12-a
and
i
believe
in
the
feinberg
law
is
that
they
advocate.
they
must
be
active
and
deliberate
advocacy
and
this
is
one
of
the
tests
for
advocacy.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
yes,
and
they
say
there
is
a
presumption
when
a
person
joins
an
organization
knowing
of
its
aims
that
he
subscribes
to
its
aims
and
this
is
something
the
school
authorities
would
then
pursuit
further
once
they
determine
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
organization.
appellants
rely
upon
cases
decided
by
this
court
since
adler
were
proscribed
activities
and
oaths
have
been
stricken
down
as
an
infringement
upon
constitutional
guarantees.
we
submit
that
the
cases
relied
upon
are
distinguishable
from
our
present
case.
for
example,
this
court
had
stricken
down
statutes
where
there
was
no
overriding
state
concern
in
the
activity
the
state
sought
to
limit
or
where
the
activities
were
proscribed
in
such
broad
terms
that
other
fundamental
rights
were
unnecessarily
interfered
with
or
where
as
in
the
elfbrandt
case,
a
person
became
liable
to
criminal
penalties
for
knowing
membership
in
an
organization
without
proof
that
the
person
subscribed
to
its
unlawful
purposes.
two
cases
which
--
upon
which
appellant
also
relies
heavily
are
the
cramp
and
baggett
cases
where
the
loyalty
also
were
required
in
language
which
is
so
vague
that
there
was
no
objective
way
to
determine
guidelines
for
conduct.
we
have
no
such
vague
language
here.
we
submit
that
the
new
york
statute
declares
ineligible
for
employment
only
those
person
who
willfully
and
deliberately
advocate,
teach
or
advice
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force,
violence
or
unlawful
means
and
this
has
been
interpreted
by
the
new
york
courts
to
be
'knowing
advocacy'.
new
york
has
confined
itself
to
a
sphere
of
legitimate
inquiry
about
conduct
which
is
proscribed
in
narrow
and
clear
terms
to
accomplish
the
desired
end
and
we
submit
that
the
right
of
the
state
to
protect
the
public
service
from
disloyalty
in
this
manner
should
be
sustained
again
as
it
was
in
the
adler
case.
in
my
opponent's
reply
brief,
he
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
105
is
now
12-a.
we
submit
as
i
did
in
the
argument
that
105
is
now
only
subdivisions
1
and
2
of
12-a,
and
this
appears
clearly
in
the
note
and
table
of
distribution
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
790
of
the
laws
of
1958
when
it
was
enacted
and
in
such
section
185
of
that
section,
there
is
a
provision
that
where
there
is
a
reference
in
any
law
as
there
still
is
in
the
feinberg
law
and
in
the
board
of
regents
rules
to
civil
service
law
12-a,
it
continues
to
refer
only
to
the
subdivisions
which
were
formerly
12-a
when
it
was
recodified
into
the
new
civil
service
law.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
there
was

case
and
the
thompson
against
wallin,
and
lederman
and

which
were
the

decisions
which

there

ms.
ruth
v.
iles
on
the
revision
of
this
section?
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
that
the
three-judge
court
went
further
than
i
believe
they
had
to
go
because
they
went
into
the
merits
of
the
controversy
and
they
discussed
subdivision
3
of
section
105.
it
was
raised
below.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
say
that
is
not
what
the
adler
case
said.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
but
--
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
well,
the
adler
case
said
that
they
were
bound
by
the
construction
placed
on
the
new
york
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
case,
it
has
been
in
the
federal
courts
all
along
and
there
has
been
no
construction
of
that
by
any
of
the
state
courts
in
this
case
and
this
court
has
said
we
are
bound
by
the
construction
--
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
believe
they
did
--
i
do
believe
they
went
that
far.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
would
say
that's
experimental.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
think
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
is
that
once
the
person
being
hired
comes
in
and
testifies
that
he
doesn't
subscribe
to
those
parts
of
the
philosophy
of
the
communist
party
which
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
but
just
subscribes
to
it
as
a
doctrine.
this
--
immediately,
the
presumption
would
then
vanish
and
then
the
burden
would
be
upon
the
person
disqualifying
them
to
show
that
he
advocates
and
willfully
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force.
now
when
the
burden
is
shifted
back
to
the
person
hiring
him
and
who
has
disqualified
him,
they
would
have
to
come
in
with
concrete
proof
either
by
statements
he
had
made
somewhere
or
by
acts
or
some
other
kind
of
concrete
proof
which
would
establish
a
case
against
him
on
disqualification.
this
would
be
the
attorney
general's
--
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
right.
then
the
burden
would
shift
in
the
attorney
general
or
in
the
disqualifying
officer
would
have
the
burden
of
coming
in
and
showing
some
overt
proof
that
this
man
is
lying
when
he
says
he
doesn't
subscribe
to
this.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
appearing
in
support
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
which
are
here
challenged.
mr.
crary,
the
state
university
counsel
will
argue
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
state
university
and
the
procedures
adopted
by
it
to
implement
these
statutes.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
case
that
the
constitutionality
of
these
statutes,
the
feinberg
law
that
is
education
law
section
3022
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
adler
case
and
that
there
have
been
no
changes
in
the
law
since
that
case
which
would
warrant
a
different
decision
here.
the
feinberg
law
was
first
enacted
in
1949
to
eliminate
from
the
states
public
school
system
as
teachers,
persons
willfully
and
deliberately
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
such
persons
were
already
ineligible
for
service
in
the
public
--
in
the
state
employment
but
the
feinberg
law
was
intended
to
implement
the
disqualification
under
civil
service
section
12-a
which
had
been
on
the
book
since
1939
by
providing
procedures
whereby
the
public
school
teachers
and
the
board
of
regents
would
implement
section
12-a
of
the
civil
service
law.
the
only
change
in
the
feinberg
law
since
1949
and
since
the
adler
case
has
been
the
fact
that
now
instead
of
just
public
school
teachers
being
covered
employees
of
the
state
university
institutions
of
higher
education
of
the
state
had
been
covered
in
and
a
requirement
has
been
added
that
the
board
of
regents
report
annually
to
the
legislature
in
the
effectiveness
of
the
act.
civil
service
law
section
12-a
has
been
amended
once
since
the
adler
case,
that
was
in
1958
when
they
added
to
section
12-a,
a
provision
that
membership
in
the
communist
party
would
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
disqualification
for
state
service.
the
only
other
change
in
section
12-a
is
that
in
a
general
recodification
of
the
civil
service
law
in
1958,
section
12-a
of
the
civil
service
law
was
renumbered
as
subdivisions
1
and
2
of
section
105
of
that
law.
appellants
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
ruling
in
the
adler
case
seek
to
make
this
case
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
every
statute
ever
enacted
in
the
state
of
new
york
having
to
do
with
subversive
activity.
for
example,
they
challenge
the
language
of
section
160
and
161
of
the
penal
law
relating
to
criminal
anarchy
but
this
is
not
a
prosecution
for
criminal
anarchy.
what's
more,
those
sections
have
been
repealed
by
a
general
revision
of
the
new
york
state
penal
law
and
effective
in
1967
they
will
no
longer
be
the
law
of
new
york
state.
appellants
also
challenged
the
language
of
civil
service
law
section
105
subdivision
3
relating
to
removal
from
public
office
for
sedition.
but
this
is
not
a
charge
of
sedition
and
these
persons
have
not
been
charged
with
treasonable
or

subdivision
3
of
section
105
was
formally
subdivision,
was
formally
section
23-a
of
the
civil
service
law
has
been
on
the
books
a
long
time
was
on
the
books
when
the
adler
case
was
decided
and
is
not
new
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
feinberg
law
and
the
rules
of
the
board
of
regents
however
continue
to
refer
only
to
civil
service
section
12-a
or
subdivisions
1
and
2
of
civil
service
law
section
105.
these
relate
only
to
the
disqualification
of
persons
for
service
in
the
state
service
for
advocating
deliberately
and
willfully
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force.
we
are
concerned
here
only
with
the
hiring
of
personnel
of
the
state
university
of
new
york
and
whether
they
are
qualified
or
not
and
we
contend
that
subdivisions
1
and
2
of
that
section
are
the
only
ones
with
which
we
are
here
concerned.
thus,
our
inquiry
is
only
whether
a
state
statute
may
disqualify
a
person
for
employment
in
a
state
college
if
he
deliberately
and
willfully
advocates
the
overthrow
of
our
government
by
force
and
violence
which
is
all
that
the
feinberg
law
in
section
12-a
do
as
far
as
these
persons
are
concerned.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
contend
that
it's
not
relevant.
on
page
16
of
my
brief
in
a
footnote,
you
will
see
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
these
--
there
has
been
a
general
revision
of
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
sections
160
and
161
have
been
repealed
effective
in
1967
and
there
will
be
a
new
provision
relating
to
criminal
anarchy
with
an
entirely
different
definition
as
of
them.
the
definition
is
in
the
footnote
on
the
bottom
of
page
16
of
the
brief.
for
this
reason,
i
feel
that
in
interpreting,
i
don't
feel
that
subdivision
3
of
section
105
of
the
civil
service
law
is
pertinent
but
certainly
even
if
it
is
pertinent,
it
seems
to
me
since
it
relates
to
the
removal
of
the
persons
for
sedition,
it
would
be
something
which
this
court
would
abstain
from
deciding
under
the
course
of
new
york
have
interpreted
these
new
sections
and
it
would
certainly
seem
premature
here
where
no
such
question
is
involved
in
the
controversy.
as
i
say
--
said,
all
we
are
concern
with
is
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
state
statute
may
disqualify
a
person
for
employment
if
he
deliberately
and
willfully
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force.
this
is
exactly
the
same
question
which
was
decided
in
the
adler
case
where
this
court
held
that
a
person
may
be
denied
the
privilege
of
working
for
the
school
system
of
the
state
of
new
york
if
he
advocates
unlawful
overthrow
of
the
government.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
in
the
adler
case,
in
construing
this
section
of
the
law
which
i
might
add
as
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
adler
case,
this
court
said
they
would
rely
upon
the
construction
placed
upon
that
section
by
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
said
that
it
had
to
be
knowing
membership
in
the
organization
but
the
person
must
not
only
know
it,
he
must
know
its
aims
and
purposes
and
they
interpreted
its
meaning
that
the
person
subscribe
to
it
and
that
if
a
person
was
a
member
and
could
explain
his
membership,
he
would
not
be
disqualified.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
no.
in
the
adler
case,
they
said
it
had
to
be
â€˜knowing
membership'
--
knowing
the
aims
of
the
organization.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
then
there
is
a
hearing
to
see
--
under
the
adler
case
it
said,
he
would
then
be
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
whether
he
had
ever
been
a
member,
whether
he
was
now
a
member.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
well,
implicit
in
section
12-a
and
i
believe
in
the
feinberg
law
is
that
they
advocate.
they
must
be
active
and
deliberate
advocacy
and
this
is
one
of
the
tests
for
advocacy.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
yes,
and
they
say
there
is
a
presumption
when
a
person
joins
an
organization
knowing
of
its
aims
that
he
subscribes
to
its
aims
and
this
is
something
the
school
authorities
would
then
pursuit
further
once
they
determine
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
organization.
appellants
rely
upon
cases
decided
by
this
court
since
adler
were
proscribed
activities
and
oaths
have
been
stricken
down
as
an
infringement
upon
constitutional
guarantees.
we
submit
that
the
cases
relied
upon
are
distinguishable
from
our
present
case.
for
example,
this
court
had
stricken
down
statutes
where
there
was
no
overriding
state
concern
in
the
activity
the
state
sought
to
limit
or
where
the
activities
were
proscribed
in
such
broad
terms
that
other
fundamental
rights
were
unnecessarily
interfered
with
or
where
as
in
the
elfbrandt
case,
a
person
became
liable
to
criminal
penalties
for
knowing
membership
in
an
organization
without
proof
that
the
person
subscribed
to
its
unlawful
purposes.
two
cases
which
--
upon
which
appellant
also
relies
heavily
are
the
cramp
and
baggett
cases
where
the
loyalty
also
were
required
in
language
which
is
so
vague
that
there
was
no
objective
way
to
determine
guidelines
for
conduct.
we
have
no
such
vague
language
here.
we
submit
that
the
new
york
statute
declares
ineligible
for
employment
only
those
person
who
willfully
and
deliberately
advocate,
teach
or
advice
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force,
violence
or
unlawful
means
and
this
has
been
interpreted
by
the
new
york
courts
to
be
'knowing
advocacy'.
new
york
has
confined
itself
to
a
sphere
of
legitimate
inquiry
about
conduct
which
is
proscribed
in
narrow
and
clear
terms
to
accomplish
the
desired
end
and
we
submit
that
the
right
of
the
state
to
protect
the
public
service
from
disloyalty
in
this
manner
should
be
sustained
again
as
it
was
in
the
adler
case.
in
my
opponent's
reply
brief,
he
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
105
is
now
12-a.
we
submit
as
i
did
in
the
argument
that
105
is
now
only
subdivisions
1
and
2
of
12-a,
and
this
appears
clearly
in
the
note
and
table
of
distribution
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
790
of
the
laws
of
1958
when
it
was
enacted
and
in
such
section
185
of
that
section,
there
is
a
provision
that
where
there
is
a
reference
in
any
law
as
there
still
is
in
the
feinberg
law
and
in
the
board
of
regents
rules
to
civil
service
law
12-a,
it
continues
to
refer
only
to
the
subdivisions
which
were
formerly
12-a
when
it
was
recodified
into
the
new
civil
service
law.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
there
was
--
adler
case
and
the
thompson
against
wallin,
and
lederman
and
lamado
which
were
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
which
were
affirmed
in

so
construed
the

there
has
also
been
a
case
since
then

127.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
on
the
revision
of
this
section?
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
that
the
three-judge
court
went
further
than
i
believe
they
had
to
go
because
they
went
into
the
merits
of
the
controversy
and
they
discussed
subdivision
3
of
section
105.
it
was
raised
below.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
say
that
is
not
what
the
adler
case
said.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
but
--
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
well,
the
adler
case
said
that
they
were
bound
by
the
construction
placed
on
the
new
york
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
case,
it
has
been
in
the
federal
courts
all
along
and
there
has
been
no
construction
of
that
by
any
of
the
state
courts
in
this
case
and
this
court
has
said
we
are
bound
by
the
construction
--
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
believe
they
did
--
i
do
believe
they
went
that
far.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
would
say
that's
experimental.
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
i
think
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
is
that
once
the
person
being
hired
comes
in
and
testifies
that
he
doesn't
subscribe
to
those
parts
of
the
philosophy
of
the
communist
party
which
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
but
just
subscribes
to
it
as
a
doctrine.
this
--
immediately,
the
presumption
would
then
vanish
and
then
the
burden
would
be
upon
the
person
disqualifying
them
to
show
that
he
advocates
and
willfully
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force.
now
when
the
burden
is
shifted
back
to
the
person
hiring
him
and
who
has
disqualified
him,
they
would
have
to
come
in
with
concrete
proof
either
by
statements
he
had
made
somewhere
or
by
acts
or
some
other
kind
of
concrete
proof
which
would
establish
a
case
against
him
on
disqualification.
this
would
be
the
attorney
general's
--
ms.
ruth
v.
iles
right.
then
the
burden
would
shift
in
the
attorney
general
or
in
the
disqualifying
officer
would
have
the
burden
of
coming
in
and
showing
some
overt
proof
that
this
man
is
lying
when
he
says
he
doesn't
subscribe
to
this.
