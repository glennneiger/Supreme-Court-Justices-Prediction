mr.
richard
lipsitz
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honors.
this
case
has
come
before
the
court
as
a
result
of
a
complaint
filed
on
behalf
of
the
class
of
persons
known
as
the
faculty
of
the
state
university
of
new
york
at
the
university
of
buffalo,
buffalo,
new
york.
a
complaint
was
filed
following
the
requirement
imposed
upon
the
members
of
the
faculty
of
that
institution
when
that
institution
became
a
state
institution
in
1962
and
previously
having
done
a
private
plea
owned,
operated,
maintained
university
at
buffalo,
new
york
known
as
the
university
of
buffalo.
when
it
became
a
state
institution
in
1962,
the
officials
of
the
state
university
of
new
york
of
which
this
was
then
a
part
applied
for
the
first
time
to
these
particular
faculty
persons
and
others
the
requirements
of
what
are
known
as
the
feinberg
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
feinberg
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
the
subject
of
course
of
the
adler
decision
previously
decided
by
this
court
in
1952.
in
our
complaint,
we
attack
again
as
was
have
done
in
the
adler
case
but
in
a
much
more
comprehensive
way
and
in
a
much
broader
scope
as
i
might
say,
the
entire
complex
of
statutes
administrative
regulations
procedures
and
certificates
that
have
become
known
as
the
administration
and
application
of
feinberg
law
and
more
specifically
we
attack
in
our
complaint
section
3021
and
3022
of
the
new
york
education
law,
section
105
of
the
new
york
civil
service
law,
article
18,
section
244
of
the
rules
of
the
regents
of
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
current
body
over
the
trustees,
the
latter
whom
administered
trustee
institutions
of
higher
learning,
the
former
of
whom
the
board
of
regents
are
responsible
for
the
entire
state
education
system.
and
also
we
attack
in
our
complaint
the
procedures
implied
--
applied
rather
by
the
various
defendants
to
implement
the
complex
statutes
known
as
the
feinberg
law.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows
and
they
have
to
be,
i
suppose,
discussed
on
two
different
levels,
if
i
may.
the
first
level
on
which
they
should
be
discussed
is
what
happened
with
the
statute
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
adler
case
and
in
that
respect,
the
facts
are
these.
as
of
the
time
of
the
decision
of
the
adler
case,
the
section
3022,
the
heart
of
the
feinberg
law
as
such
was
not
applicable
by
its
very
terms
to
any
employees
whether
they'd
be
faculty
or
other
kinds
of
personnel
to
institutions
of
higher
education.
the
statute
was
applicable
solely
and
wholly
to
institutions
known
as
public
schools
which
in
new
york
state
and
elsewhere
in
united
states
are
those
considered
to
be
elementary
and
high
school.
in
1953
after
the
adler
decision,
the
new
york
state
legislature
added
these
words
to
section
3022
of
the
new
york
education
law
and
i
quote,
“in
all
other
personnel
and
employees
of
any
college
or
other
institution
of
higher
education
owned
and
operated
by
the
state
or
any
subdivision
thereof,”
thus,
making
the
statute,
for
the
first
time,
applicable
to
university,
college
and
college
faculty,
professors
and
other
personnel.
furthermore,
this
was
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
we
say
that
it
makes
a
different
issue.
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
i
think
it
should
be
stated
at
the
outset
if
i
haven't
made
it
plain
and
we
are
also
attacking
the
entire
statutory
arrangements
even
as
it
was
previously
before
this
change
in
1953.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
the
other
changes
occurred
of
which
much
was
made
by
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
the
three
men
court
which
heard
this
case
about
which
we
will
see
more
later
was
that
section
12-a
of
the
new
york
civil
service
law
that
being
the
statute
at
the
time
of
the
adler
case
was
in
1958
changed
to
section
105
of
the
new
york
state
civil
service
law
and
prior
to
the
time
of
its
change
to
becoming
section
105,
it
added
a
new
provision.
that
new
provision
is
the
second
paragraph
of
105(c)
which
may
be
found,
if
your
honors
care
to
look
at
it,
at
page
113
of
our
brief
and
also
of
course
in
the
record.
and
that
section
added
these
words,
“for
the
purposes
of
this
section,
members
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
of
america
or
the
communist
party
of
the
state
new
york
shall
constitute
a
prima
facie”
--
two
words
prima
facie
having
been
emphasized,
“evidence
of
disqualification
for
appointment
to
a
retention
of
any
officer
position
in
the
service
of
the
state
or
of
any
city
or
civil
division
thereof.”
that
section
--
that
provision
rather
was
not
in
the
then
section
12-a
of
the
civil
service
when
the
adler
case
was
before
this
court.
it
was
added
to
12-a
subsequent
to
adler
and
then
was
converted
in
the
section
105
of
the
civil
service
law.
at
the
time
it
became
105
of
the
new
york
state
civil
service
law,
there
was
also
added
subdivision
3
to
formerly
12-a
and
now
105
and
subdivision
3
is
found
at
page
114
of
our
brief
and
also
of
course
in
the
record
and
rather
than
quoting
it
from
you,
i
will
tell
you
that
it
adds
to
105,
a
provision
which
--
but
for
one
sentence
is
almost
identical
with
the
provisions
of
section
3021
of
the
new
york
education
law.
the
one
sentence
which
is
added
as
a
reference
to
a
definition
of
what
is
meant
by
any
treasonable
or
seditious
act
or
acts
to
the
new
york
penal
law,
sections
160
and
161
but
which
will
not
expressly
refer
to
are
the
sections
of
the
new
york
penal
law
where
the
definitions
of
these
terms
could
be
found.
we
are
not
here
attacking
as
such
the
constitutionality
of
section
160
and
161
of
the
new
york
penal
law.
we,
however,
in
our
argument
will
suggest
and
indeed
point
out
that
if
the
interpretation
of
this
subdivision
3
of
section
105
is
dependent
upon
an
interpretation
by
somebody
of
this
court
or
otherwise
of
160
and
161
of
the
penal
law
that
section
--
subdivision
3
is
of
course
unconstitutional
for
being
indefinite
and
a
restriction
on
first
amendment
rights.
now
those,
your
honors,
are
the
statutory
changes
in
which
i
referred
to
as
the
level
of
facts
that
can
be
best
described
in
this
fashion
that
have
occurred
since
the
adler
case.
i
would
like
to
stress
one
thing
which
i
think
--
we
do
think
deserves
some
mentioned
and
that
is
this,
that
when
those
words
were
added
to
section
3022,
that
is
to
say
their
application
to
any
personnel
or
employees
of
any
college
or
rather
institution
of
higher
education,
there
was
no
claim
by
the
new
york
state
legislature
that
there
was
any
present
prospective
future,
potential
or
otherwise
any
kind
of
danger,
imminent
or
about
to
occur
to
those
institutions.
they
didn't
even
refer
to
the
fact
that
they
have
made
findings
in
1949
relating
to
the
alleged
fear,
danger
and
imminence
of
so
called
infiltrations
of
the
public
schools
system
by
the
persons
who
would
be
following
some
subversive
course
of
conduct.
they
not
only
didn't
refer
to
it,
they
didn't
rely
upon
it.
they
just
put
it
in
the
statute
without
any
legislative
reliance,
finding
or
investigation.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
as
a
matter
of
law.
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no,
sir.
but
as
a
matter
of
determining
whether
or
not
as
we
would
argue,
there
is
some
basis
for
the
state
acting
in
this
field
that
is
to
say
in
the
field
of
first
amendment
rights,
we
say
that
it
indicates
a
lack
of
any
compelling
need
to
allow
at
the
kind
of
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
which
the
court
has
from
time
to
time
allowed
because
of
a
demonstration
of
need
but
we
don't
claim
that
there
is
any
constitutional
requirement
that
a
state
legislature
make
a
finding.
we
say
that
however
that
it
does
have
an
impact
upon
whether
or
not
there
was
any
basis
for
allowing
and
there
is
any
basis
at
the
present
time
for
allowing
an
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
of
persons
who
happened
to
be
university
and
college
or
teachers
and
other
faculty.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
if
you're
suggesting
--
if
i
understand
your
honor,
judge
warren
--
justice
warren,
you're
asking
me
to
explain
it
now
or
you're
saying
later
on?
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no.
well,
we
don't
make
any
claim
in
our
brief
as
such
although
other
briefs
do
that
there
is
a
less
susceptibility.
there
is
no
--
i
will
argue
with
you
and
to
you
that
there
is
less
susceptibility.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
no
demonstration
that
there
is
anybody
employed
or
about
to
be
employed
in
the
state
university
system
from
which
this
alleged
danger
would
have
occur
that
was
found
to
be
a
fact
in
regard
to
the
public
school
system.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
bigger
or
less
susceptibility
on
the
part
of
students
although
that
is
an
issue
that
can
be
argued
in
terms
of
academic
freedom
that
persons
as
they
grow
older
become
more
mature
and
should
be
able
to
accept
different
points
of
view
much
more
readily
than
innocent
in
younger
school
children.
now,
the
facts
that
occurred
in
regard
to
the
particular
plaintiffs
are
these.
each
of
these
particular
plaintiffs
had
been
employed
by
the
then
university
of
buffalo
in
one
capacity
or
another
at
a
time
when
it
was
the
university
of
buffalo
and
private
institution.
there
were
of
course
was
no
requirement
that
they
subscribe
to
anything,
signed
anything
or
otherwise
provide
any
information
except
as
to
their
professional
competence
or
fitness
to
become
employed
at
the
time
of
hiring.
one
of
them,
plaintiff
starbuck
who
is
treated
somewhat
differently
by
the
state
and
therefore
has
had
a
different
history
in
respect
to
what's
happened
to
him
was
employed
as
a
librarian.
it
is
claimed
by
the
state
and
was
so
found
by
the
court
below
that
his
employment
was
not
an
academic
employment
and
that
therefore
his
employment
was
not
subject
to
section
3021
or
3022
of
the
education
law
but
rather
he
was
in
the
case
of
any
other
civil
servant
of
the
state
of
new
york
under
the
provisions
of
the
civil
service
law
to
be
qualified
or
disqualified
from
employment
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
105
on
new
york
state
civil
service
law.
he
was
asked
after
having
been
employed.
in
other
words,
excuse
me,
after
he
became
employed,
i
must
show
the
correction.
he
was
the
one
person
employed
while
this
institution
was
a
public
university.
he
became
employed
after
the
merger,
the
only
one
of
the
plaintiffs.
and
when
he
was
employed,
he
was
employed
without
any
requirement
that
he
signed
anything
or
answer
anything
but
along
after
several
months
of
employment,
he
was
asked
the
question
that
appears
at
page
65
of
our
brief
and
otherwise
in
the
record
in
which
the
question
based
strictly
upon
the
statutory
provisions
found
in
section
105
and
that
question
was,
“have
you
ever
advised
or
taught
or
were
you
ever
a
member
of
any
society
of
group
of
person
who
taught
or
advocated
the
doctrine
of
the
government
of
united
states
or
of
any
political
subdivision
there
shall
be
--
should
be
overthrown
or
overthrown
by
forced
violence
or
any
other
unlawful
means?”
he
declined
and
refused
to
answer
that
question
whereupon
his
employment
was
threatened
to
be
terminated.
he
in
fact
brought
a
lawsuit
of
his
own
that
is
as
the
sole
plaintiff
in
federal
district
court
to
seek
in
juncture
relief
against
it.
that
lawsuit
was
thereafter
abandoned
in
favor
of
his
becoming
and
joining
as
a
plaintiff
and
this
lawsuit
which
is
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
he
stated
that
he
felt
it
was
an
infringement
upon
his
conscience
and
that
it
was
unconstitutional
requiring
him
to
answer
it.
he
did
this
however
not
before
any
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
well
your
honor,
i
think
his
answer
is
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
he
gives
his
own
statements
which
he
appended
to
the
answers.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no,
sir.
that
was
not
the
issue
at
all
as
far
he
was
concerned.
however,
he
didn't
do
to
support
of
any
hearing.
on
the
back
--
as
i
recalled
on
the
back
of
the
form,
he
put
down
some
reasons
why
he,
george
starbuck
declined
to
answer
this
question.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
have
you
ever
advised
or
taught
or
were
you
ever
a
member
of
any
society
of
group
of
persons
who
taught
or
advocated
the
doctrine
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
be
overthrown
by
the
course
of
violence
or
other
unlawful
means,
and
his
objections
i
can
point
out
to
you
in
a
minute
after
we
check
the
record.
the
other
four
plaintiffs
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
he
made
a
request
for
a
hearing.
yes,
sir.
but
it
was
claimed
that
he's
a
temporary
employee
and
otherwise
that
he
had
no
right
to
a
hearing
on
this
issue.
he
was
temporarily
employed,
it
was
claimed
by
the
state
and
therefore
as
a
temporary
employee
he
had
no
rights
to
hearings
of
any
kind.
the
answer
is
it's
difficult
to
read
but
it's
found
at
exhibit
which
was
contained
at
portfolio
299
of
the
record
where
in
his
own
handwriting,
he
says
that
he
prefers
not
to
answer
or
at
least
into
the
necessity
and
relevance
of
this
question
is
properly
explained
to
me,
initials
g.s.
that's
the
answer
that
he
gave
them.
the
other
four
plaintiffs,
if
i
may
your
honors,
were
all
persons
who
are
employed
as
faculty
members.
let
us
say
teachers
of
one
subject
or
another
in
the
state
university
and
they
declined
to
sign
what
are
known
as
in
this
litigation
and
prior
thereto
the
feinberg
certificates.
now,
the
feinberg
certificates,
your
honors,
are
found
in
our
appendix
at
pages
122
and
123
and
also
in
the
record.
and
the
feinberg
certificates
required
when
presented
to
the
plaintiffs
that
they
sign
after
having
read
the
statements
which
appear
thereupon.
each
of
the
four
plaintiffs
declined
and
refused
to
sign
the
feinberg
certificates.
they
were
threatened
with
the
dismissal
and
i
don't
use
the
word
threatened
in
a
menacing
way,
they
were
told
that
they
were
going
to
be
dismissed
because
there
was
an
obligation
on
their
part
to
sign
this.
they
then
joined
as
plaintiffs
with
starbuck
and
this
lawsuit
was
commenced
seeking
to
declare
the
entire
system
statutes
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
you
mean
where
it's
set
forth,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
lipsitz
it
says
that
at
122
and
123
of
the
brief,
also
your
honor,
we
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no.
that
was
the
one
that
starbuck
was
required
to
sandwich
the
civil
service
questionnaire.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
it's
in
our
brief
which
i
happened
to
have
the
references
to
page
122
and
123.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
you
will
also
find
in
the
record
that
the
identical
documents
that
you
find
in
122
and
123.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
their
grounds
are
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes,
plus
the
fact
that
they
felt
that
it
was
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
involved
in
this
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
there
has
never
been
a
claim
at
any
time
by
anybody
in
the
employment
of
the
state
system
that
there
was
a
fear
of
apprehension
that
these
people
maybe
giving
evidence
against
themselves
by
virtue
of
having
being
required
to
sign
this.
they
did
not
rely
upon
the
fifth
amendment
rights
except
as
far
as
due
process
of
law
is
concerned
and
not
the
self-incrimination.
now,
those
are
the
--
i
think
perhaps
it's
really
fair
to
say
that
the
state
has
through
forbearance
exercise
in
its
part
in
taking
the
position
that
it
would
not
discharge
any
of
the
plaintiffs
except
starbuck
who
was
dismissed
until
this
litigation
is
disposed
of
through
the
court
system,
solely
for
their
failure
to
have
signed
the
certificates.
now
then,
when
this
action
was
commenced
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
well,
one
of
them
was
an
appointment
for
a
year
the
lead
case
keyishian
and
his
employment
was
not
renewed
so
he
is
no
longer
there
but
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
lawsuit
as
to
whether
it
wasn't
renewed
because
of
his
failure
to
sign
it.
the
state
says
that
we
show
under
our
own
procedures
not
to
renew
them
and
one
has
left
voluntarily
to
take
employment
at
another
institution
outside
of
the
state
system
and
that's
plaintiff
maud
and
the
other
two
are
still
there
in
the
sense
of
any
outcome
of
this
lawsuit.
the
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
they
are
threatened
with
discharge
but
that
isn't
the
whole
answer
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
a
minute
but
nevertheless,
they
still
have
this
threat
discharging
over
their
head.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
if
i
will
explain
in
this
fashion.
after
this
lawsuit
was
started,
it
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
any
substantial
question.
it
was
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit,
a
complaint
was
reinstated
by
decision
written
by
justice
marshall
and
it
came
back
and
it
was
tried
before
the
three
men
court.
one
week
before
the
trial
was
to
have
been
commenced
before
the
three
men
court,
the
state
adopted
a
new
policy
for
administering
the
so-called
feinberg
law
and
that
new
policy
is
found
at
pages
124
and
125
of
our
brief
that
is
also
found
elsewhere
in
the
record.
and
that
new
policy
withdraws
the
certificates
so
that
as
of
that
time
although
we
don't
know
and
there's
no
human
being
can
assert
with
the
certainty
that
the
certificate
requirement
will
never
again
in
the
future
will
be
reintroduced
in
the
state
system.
at
that
time,
the
certificates
were
withdrawn
and
in
there
place,
the
procedure
set
forth
was
made
--
the
manner
of
administering
the
feinberg
law
for
the
state
university.
but
in
answer
to
your
question
justice
white,
the
paragraph
which
appears
in
the
middle
of
page
125
reads
that
and
i'm
not
going
to
quote
it
but
nevertheless
that
no
presently
employed
person
and
that
is
to
say
our
plaintiffs
shall
be
deemed
qualified
or
ineligible
“solely
by
reason
to
such
failure”,
referring
to
the
failure
to
sign
the
so-called
feinberg
certificates.
so
this
isn't
out
of
the
case.
this
is
an
element
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
their
continued
future
employment
when
and
if
the
time
comes
that
the
state
is
going
to
determine
as
a
result
of
following
the
conclusion
and
the
decision
in
this
lawsuit
what
to
do
with
this
plaintiffs.
it
says
it
shall
not
solely
be,
it
doesn't
say
shall
not
be
so
that
our
answer
to
the
question
is
they're
still
threatened
and
it
would
be
imminence
of
dismissal
if
this
law
should
be
declared
on
constitution.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no.
we
object
of
course
to
the
new
procedure
as
well
as
to
the
old
procedure
and
we
claim
that
the
laws
are
all
unconstitutional
for
the
reasons
that
we
will
argue
in
the
remaining
time
and
in
the
brief.
they
--
these
new
procedures,
it
does
not
appear
on
the
record
have
or
haven't
been
applied
to
the
present
plaintiffs
and
if
you
will
remember,
they
were
introduced
one
week
before
the
case
was
tried
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
one
way
or
another
to
indicate
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
plaintiffs
if
the
new
procedure
is
to
be
applied
to
them.
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
them
but
they
still
have
to
guide
themselves
according
to
what
they
have
been
told
as
now
the
method
of
enforcing
the
statute.
that
is
to
say
that
they
must
comply
with
in
on
all
time
considered
that
they
are
eligible
to
be
retain
an
employment
only
if
they
understand
and
agree
that
the
rules
of
the
regents
in
the
various
statutes
are
part
of
their
conditions
of
employment.
that's
set
forth
a
new
procedure
so
that
we
don't
rely
just
upon
the
words
solely.
we
rely
upon
the
fact
that
they
too
as
well
as
any
other
employee
of
the
state
university
is
now
subjective
to
this
new
procedure
which
we
don't
claim
or
it's
considered
as
any
as
more
superior
in
a
constitutional
sense
in
the
old
procedure.
now,
those
if
i
may
your
honors,
are
the
facts
that
have
been
involved
in
these
plaintiffs
in
these
cases.
i
like
to
turn
now
to
the
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
if
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
there
has
been
an
expression
by
a
substantial
number
of
faculty
members
some
300
to
400
out
of
a
total
faculty
at
that
institution
of
approximately
a
thousand
that
an
expression
was
took
place
in
the
form
of
a
resolution
condemning
the
requirement
that
they
have
to
comply
with
the
feinberg
law.
only
these
persons,
the
plaintiffs
have
refused
outright
to
comply
with.
they
have
exceeded.
they
have
gone
along.
that
is
to
say
those
employed
at
the
time
went
along
with
it
and
said
rather
than
that
we
will
sign.
now,
we
claim
in
our
briefs
and
we
argue
before
the
court
that
these
statutes
certainly
should
be
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
as
an
infringement
upon
first
amendment
rights
as
a
bill
of
attainder
and
for
lacking
of
due
process
in
regard
to
all
persons
affected
by
these
statutes
including
the
plaintiffs.
we
particularly
argue
in
this
case
of
course
the
current
constitution
in
respect
to
institutions
of
higher
learning
or
reasons
that
there
has
been
no
demonstration
of
any
need
of
going
or
otherwise
to
invade
first
amendment
rights
and
that
there
is
an
expression
joined
quite
imminently
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
since
adler
that
academic
freedom
has
a
right
to
cherish
and
to
be
fully
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
as
--
on
this
--
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
first
amendment
rights
of
these
plaintiffs
are
violated,
we
of
course,
rely
upon
all
of
the
cases
on
this
subject
which
had
been
decided
since
adler
and
which
without
suggesting
to
your
honors
although
the
question
was
asked
that
it
is
necessary
to
overrule
adler
nevertheless
indicate
that
this
court
has
departed
in
some
substantial
measure
from
the
standards
of
adler
and
i
don't
need
only
to
refer
to
the
acknowledgment
of
the
minority
of
this
court
itself
in
the
elfbrandt
decision
were
it
states
and
at
one
portion
of
the
elfbrandt
decision
that
though
the
majority
did
not
purport
to
overrule
or
delimit
adler,
at
the
end
of
the
decision
nevertheless
the
minority
decision
in
effect
says
but
that's
about
what
they
did
by
virtue
of
the
decision.
now,
in
what
fashion
has
this
court
departed
from
what
appears
to
have
been
what
was
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
adler
decision?
the
answer
is
this,
we
think.
firstly,
adler
states
and
it
states
as
plainly
as
can
be
that
there
is
no
right
to
public
employment,
that
if
the
person
doesn't
like
what
he's
required
to
submit
to
as
an
employer
of
the
state,
he
has
a
perfectly
free
choice
to
go
elsewhere.
this
court
and
i
need
not
to
spend
the
time
going
into
the
decisions
that
have
been
written
on
the
subject
as
quite
candidly
and
expressly
stated
in
subsequent
decisions
that
unconditional,
that
unconstitutional
conditions
may
not
be
imposed
upon
public
employment
anymore
than
it
can
be
on
any
other
public
right.
in
the
doctrine
that
if
you
don't
like
what
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
become
employed
by
the
state,
you
can
go
elsewhere
is
no
longer
we
think
the
law
as
expressed
in
a
number
of
cases
decided
subsequent
to
adler.
one
of
which
of
course
elfbrandt
and
other
which
is
the
case
decided
from
oregon
on
the
same
subject
the
baggett
and
bullitt
case.
in
addition
to
which
in
other
areas,
it
has
been
quite
clear
that
the
court
has
apparently
taken
this
position.
but
more
importantly
than
that
and
we
have
attempted
to
analyze
the
complex
questions
that
are
presented
by
the
section
105
requirements
and
we
do
that
starting
at
page
35
through
37
of
our
brief.
the
requirements
imposed
by
section
105
in
new
york
state
civil
service
law
just
as
much
now
as
i
work
for
the
time
of
adler
though
not
brief
nor
argued
before
this
court
as
our
research
indicates
when
adler
was
argued,
the
requirements
of
105
are
so
vague,
are
so
contradictory
and
indeed
are
so
overreaching
in
our
view
that
they
cannot
add
by
themselves
constitutionally
be
sustained
for
instance
and
i
won't
go
into
all
of
the
various
considerations
that
are
present
in
section
105
but
it
appears
that
merely
embracing
the
doctrine,
the
marx's
if
you
will,
the
government
should
be
overthrown
by
force
or
violence
is
a
ground
for
disqualifying
a
person
from
public
employment
not
by
doing
of
an
act
but
the
embracing
of
a
doctrine
and
this
is
as
clear
as
clear
can
be
from
the
provisions
of
section
105
if
one
carefully
reads
and
analyzes
them
an
i
refer
to
the
provisions
of
section
subdivision
1(b).
section
1(b)
of
--
subdivision
1(b)
of
the
civil
service
law
section
105
also
makes
it
unlawful
to
print,
publish,
edit,
issue
or
sell
any
book
in
which
the
doctrine
is
contained.
well,
at
the
same
time
advocating
or
embracing
that
is
to
say
having
the
belief
of
the
duty.
now,
we
say
for
a
variety
of
reasons
the
whole
section
is
unable
to
be
sustained
constitutionally
based
upon
present
standards
of
this
court.
i
would
turn
now
to
the
argument
that
we
think
is
a
key
to
the
decision
of
which
--
when
it
is
made
in
this
case
and
that
is
this.
the
state
has
taken
the
position
very
proudly
that
unlike
other
loyalty
complexes
from
other
states,
new
york
state
has
provided
the
optimum
of
due
process
because
all
that
new
york
state
says
is
that
the
person
who
has
been
or
is
a
member
of
the
subversive
organization,
in
this
case
the
communist
party,
is
only
prima
facie
disqualified
from
either
becoming
employed
or
retaining
employment.
and
by
virtue
of
those
two
words
your
honors,
the
state
claims
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
entire
system
provided
for
under
section
3022.
we
claim
that
this
doctrine
in
a
sense
imposes
an
impossible
burden
upon
the
persons
involved
who
if
some
of
them
were
to
concede
or
admit
that
they
are
members
of
the
communist
party
could
over
--
only
overcome
this
burden
in
the
words
of
the
united
states
--
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
and
one
of
the
three
cases
which
became
known
as
adler.
they
can
only
overcome
it
in
the
following
fashion,
(a)
by
proving
that
the
organization
is
not
subversive
an
impossible
burden
in
any
hearing
because
they
don't
have
acknowledgment
against
the
forces
of
the
state
which
has
already
proved
this
to
its
own
satisfaction,
the
ability
of
the
individual
to
prove
that
it
is
not
subversive
as
an
impossible
burden
or
(b)
denying
membership
or
(c)
denying
knowledge
of
the
aims
and
goals
of
the
organization.
according
to
the
lederman
decision,
one
of
the
three
cases
involved
in
adler,
these
are
the
three
things
that
are
necessary
to
overcome
the
presumption.
there
is
absolutely
had
been
no
consideration
given
to
the
facts
as
evidence
by
the
elfbrandt
decision,
the
aptheker
decision,
the
scales
decision
the
noto
decision
of
this
court
that
innocent
knowing
membership
cannot
be
and
should
not
be
the
grounds
for
disqualifying
anything
neither
employment
as
a
teacher
elfbrandt
nor
ability
to
obtain
a
passport,
aptheker.
the
state
of
new
york
has
said
in
its
right
in
the
decision.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no,
sir.
scales
and
noto
merely
stood
for
the
doctrine
as
we
understand
that
it
takes
more
to
convict
one
of
being
a
member
under
the
membership
clause
than
mere
knowledge
of
the
aims
of
the
organization.
it
must
take
activity
in
pursuance
of
the
unlawful
aims.
the
state
of
new
york
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
you
--
to
overcome
this
presumption,
you
have
to
prove
that
the
organization
wasn't
subversive
that
you
were
a
member
of
it
but
that
you
didn't
know
its
aims
and
to
neglects
completely
to
consider
what
is
now
the
law
as
we
see
it
in
terms
of
the
rights
that
have
been
created
by
these
other
decisions
that
innocent
knowing
membership
cannot
be
the
grounds
for
disqualification
which
is
the
elfbrandt
decision.
now,
we
say
that
the
so
called
doctrine
of
rational
connection
in
this
field
which
has
been
used
to
justify
the
upholding
of
prima
facie
presumptions
if
you
will
and
shifting
the
burdens
to
the
person
seeking
employment
as
a
doctrine
which
not
only
should
not
be
applied
to
the
field
where
the
first
amendment
rights
of
speech
or
association
that
are
involved
but
indeed
there
is
no
rational
connection
between
what
has
being
done
by
the
state
here
and
what
we
claim
as
the
fact
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
state
has
never
demonstrated
that
anything
involving
membership
in
any
organization
is
the
equivalent
of
disqualifying
or
should
be
the
equivalent
of
disqualifying
a
person
from
teaching.
furthermore,
it
is
our
claim,
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
that
the
--
under
the
brown
decision,
the
effect
of
the
state
legislature
in
1958
now
said
that
members
of
the
communist
party
are
ineligible
to
all
office
in
the
state
constitutes
a
bill
of
attainder
and
as
such
it
is
constitutionally
defective.
while
it
is
true
that
the
court
in
adler
upheld
the
proposition
that
an
administrative
agency
could
make
a
finding,
it
did
it
at
a
time
before
it
was
determined
how
it
was
going
to
be
done
and
what
manner
of
means
are
going
to
be
used
as
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
his
dissent
before
the
statute
had
anything
but
its
bare
bones
on
it.
but
in
any
event
when
the
legislature
in
1958
said
legislatively
no
person
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
shall
be
eligible
or
that
is
to
say
membership
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
ineligibility.
the
legislature
said
as
did
the
congress
in
brown
against
the
united
states
that
this
means
a
person
is
ineligible
to
be
employed
in
the
state
university.
we
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
my
answer
is
very
clear,
your
honor.
it
is
not
the
law
and
we
rely
upon
lederman
versus
the
board
of
education,
one
of
the
three
cases
constituting
the
adler
case
where
it
barely
clearly
says
that
all
he
can
do
is
(a)
deny
membership
or
(b)
that
the
organization
advocates
the
overthrow
that
is
to
challenge
the
finding
of
the
board
of
regents
or
that
he
--
or
(c)
that
he
has
knowledge
of
advocacy.
it's
all
he
can
do
to
overcome
the
presumption.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
i
don't
know
upon
what
they
rely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
that's
yes.
it's
lederman
versus
board
of
education.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
it's
one
of
the
three
that's
there
involved
in
the
adler
case.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
i
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
what
it
meant,
your
honors,
because
it
says
so
in
black
and
white
in
their
decision
and
it's
also
stated
at
thompson
against
wallin.
it's
not
as
they
simply
put
it
that
once
somebody
comes
in
and
says
i
didn't
believe
an
advocacy
that
the
presumption
disappears.
that's
just
doesn't
the
way
it
works.
literally
speaking
and
i
quoted
from
lederman
against
board
of
education.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
lederman,
l-e-d-e-r-m-a-n
v.
board
of
education,
your
honor.
it's
cited
to
75
of
my
brief.
it's
one
of
the
three
adler
cases.
the
court
says
quote
referring
to
this
procedure.
“he
may
(a)
deny
membership;
(b)
that
the
organization
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force;
and
(c)
that
he
has
knowledge
of
such
advocacy.”
this
not
this
business
about
coming
in
and
saying
but
i
don't
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
advocacy
or
i
don't
believe
in
the
doctrine
or
advocate
the
doctrine
and
therefore
the
presumption
disappears.
he's
got
--
he's
very
limited
in
what
he
can
do
under
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
interpretation
of
this
section.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
thompson
against
wallin
also.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
thompson
against
wallin
also.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
they
were
the
two
--
the
three
of
them
constituted
to
name
otherwise
the
adler
case.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
and
lederman.
the
same
case.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes,
she
mentioned
thompson
against
wallin
but
they
also
will
tell
you
that
they
rely
upon
lederman
because
lederman
is
one
of
the
three
cases
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
have
stated
in
the
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
oh,
they
are
decided
the
same
day
and
in
fact
you
can
find
them
in
the
new
york
reports
one
page
after
another.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes,
sir.
there's
no
--
and
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
them
by
the
way.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honors.
this
case
has
come
before
the
court
as
a
result
of
a
complaint
filed
on
behalf
of
the
class
of
persons
known
as
the
faculty
of
the
state
university
of
new
york
at
the
university
of
buffalo,
buffalo,
new
york.
a
complaint
was
filed
following
the
requirement
imposed
upon
the
members
of
the
faculty
of
that
institution
when
that
institution
became
a
state
institution
in
1962
and
previously
having
done
a
private
plea
owned,
operated,
maintained
university
at
buffalo,
new
york
known
as
the
university
of
buffalo.
when
it
became
a
state
institution
in
1962,
the
officials
of
the
state
university
of
new
york
of
which
this
was
then
a
part
applied
for
the
first
time
to
these
particular
faculty
persons
and
others
the
requirements
of
what
are
known
as
the
feinberg
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
feinberg
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
the
subject
of
course
of
the
adler
decision
previously
decided
by
this
court
in
1952.
in
our
complaint,
we
attack
again
as
was
have
done
in
the
adler
case
but
in
a
much
more
comprehensive
way
and
in
a
much
broader
scope
as
i
might
say,
the
entire
complex
of
statutes
administrative
regulations
procedures
and
certificates
that
have
become
known
as
the
administration
and
application
of
feinberg
law
and
more
specifically
we
attack
in
our
complaint
section
3021
and
3022
of
the
new
york
education
law,
section
105
of
the
new
york
civil
service
law,
article
18,
section
244
of
the
rules
of
the
regents
of
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
current
body
over
the
trustees,
the
latter
whom
administered
trustee
institutions
of
higher
learning,
the
former
of
whom
the
board
of
regents
are
responsible
for
the
entire
state
education
system.
and
also
we
attack
in
our
complaint
the
procedures
implied
--
applied
rather
by
the
various
defendants
to
implement
the
complex
statutes
known
as
the
feinberg
law.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows
and
they
have
to
be,
i
suppose,
discussed
on
two
different
levels,
if
i
may.
the
first
level
on
which
they
should
be
discussed
is
what
happened
with
the
statute
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
adler
case
and
in
that
respect,
the
facts
are
these.
as
of
the
time
of
the
decision
of
the
adler
case,
the
section
3022,
the
heart
of
the
feinberg
law
as
such
was
not
applicable
by
its
very
terms
to
any
employees
whether
they'd
be
faculty
or
other
kinds
of
personnel
to
institutions
of
higher
education.
the
statute
was
applicable
solely
and
wholly
to
institutions
known
as
public
schools
which
in
new
york
state
and
elsewhere
in
united
states
are
those
considered
to
be
elementary
and
high
school.
in
1953
after
the
adler
decision,
the
new
york
state
legislature
added
these
words
to
section
3022
of
the
new
york
education
law
and
i
quote,
“in
all
other
personnel
and
employees
of
any
college
or
other
institution
of
higher
education
owned
and
operated
by
the
state
or
any
subdivision
thereof,”
thus,
making
the
statute,
for
the
first
time,
applicable
to
university,
college
and
college
faculty,
professors
and
other
personnel.
furthermore,
this
was
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
we
say
that
it
makes
a
different
issue.
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
i
think
it
should
be
stated
at
the
outset
if
i
haven't
made
it
plain
and
we
are
also
attacking
the
entire
statutory
arrangements
even
as
it
was
previously
before
this
change
in
1953.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
the
other
changes
occurred
of
which
much
was
made
by
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
the
three
men
court
which
heard
this
case
about
which
we
will
see
more
later
was
that
section
12-a
of
the
new
york
civil
service
law
that
being
the
statute
at
the
time
of
the
adler
case
was
in
1958
changed
to
section
105
of
the
new
york
state
civil
service
law
and
prior
to
the
time
of
its
change
to
becoming
section
105,
it
added
a
new
provision.
that
new
provision
is
the
second
paragraph
of
105(c)
which
may
be
found,
if
your
honors
care
to
look
at
it,
at
page
113
of
our
brief
and
also
of
course
in
the
record.
and
that
section
added
these
words,
“for
the
purposes
of
this
section,
members
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
of
america
or
the
communist
party
of
the
state
new
york
shall
constitute
a
prima
facie”
--
two
words
prima
facie
having
been
emphasized,
“evidence
of
disqualification
for
appointment
to
a
retention
of
any
officer
position
in
the
service
of
the
state
or
of
any
city
or
civil
division
thereof.”
that
section
--
that
provision
rather
was
not
in
the
then
section
12-a
of
the
civil
service
when
the
adler
case
was
before
this
court.
it
was
added
to
12-a
subsequent
to
adler
and
then
was
converted
in
the
section
105
of
the
civil
service
law.
at
the
time
it
became
105
of
the
new
york
state
civil
service
law,
there
was
also
added
subdivision
3
to
formerly
12-a
and
now
105
and
subdivision
3
is
found
at
page
114
of
our
brief
and
also
of
course
in
the
record
and
rather
than
quoting
it
from
you,
i
will
tell
you
that
it
adds
to
105,
a
provision
which
--
but
for
one
sentence
is
almost
identical
with
the
provisions
of
section
3021
of
the
new
york
education
law.
the
one
sentence
which
is
added
as
a
reference
to
a
definition
of
what
is
meant
by
any
treasonable
or
seditious
act
or
acts
to
the
new
york
penal
law,
sections
160
and
161
but
which
will
not
expressly
refer
to
are
the
sections
of
the
new
york
penal
law
where
the
definitions
of
these
terms
could
be
found.
we
are
not
here
attacking
as
such
the
constitutionality
of
section
160
and
161
of
the
new
york
penal
law.
we,
however,
in
our
argument
will
suggest
and
indeed
point
out
that
if
the
interpretation
of
this
subdivision
3
of
section
105
is
dependent
upon
an
interpretation
by
somebody
of
this
court
or
otherwise
of
160
and
161
of
the
penal
law
that
section
--
subdivision
3
is
of
course
unconstitutional
for
being
indefinite
and
a
restriction
on
first
amendment
rights.
now
those,
your
honors,
are
the
statutory
changes
in
which
i
referred
to
as
the
level
of
facts
that
can
be
best
described
in
this
fashion
that
have
occurred
since
the
adler
case.
i
would
like
to
stress
one
thing
which
i
think
--
we
do
think
deserves
some
mentioned
and
that
is
this,
that
when
those
words
were
added
to
section
3022,
that
is
to
say
their
application
to
any
personnel
or
employees
of
any
college
or
rather
institution
of
higher
education,
there
was
no
claim
by
the
new
york
state
legislature
that
there
was
any
present
prospective
future,
potential
or
otherwise
any
kind
of
danger,
imminent
or
about
to
occur
to
those
institutions.
they
didn't
even
refer
to
the
fact
that
they
have
made
findings
in
1949
relating
to
the
alleged
fear,
danger
and
imminence
of
so
called
infiltrations
of
the
public
schools
system
by
the
persons
who
would
be
following
some
subversive
course
of
conduct.
they
not
only
didn't
refer
to
it,
they
didn't
rely
upon
it.
they
just
put
it
in
the
statute
without
any
legislative
reliance,
finding
or
investigation.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
as
a
matter
of
law.
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no,
sir.
but
as
a
matter
of
determining
whether
or
not
as
we
would
argue,
there
is
some
basis
for
the
state
acting
in
this
field
that
is
to
say
in
the
field
of
first
amendment
rights,
we
say
that
it
indicates
a
lack
of
any
compelling
need
to
allow
at
the
kind
of
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
which
the
court
has
from
time
to
time
allowed
because
of
a
demonstration
of
need
but
we
don't
claim
that
there
is
any
constitutional
requirement
that
a
state
legislature
make
a
finding.
we
say
that
however
that
it
does
have
an
impact
upon
whether
or
not
there
was
any
basis
for
allowing
and
there
is
any
basis
at
the
present
time
for
allowing
an
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
of
persons
who
happened
to
be
university
and
college
or
teachers
and
other
faculty.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
if
you're
suggesting
--
if
i
understand
your
honor,
judge
warren
--
justice
warren,
you're
asking
me
to
explain
it
now
or
you're
saying
later
on?
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no.
well,
we
don't
make
any
claim
in
our
brief
as
such
although
other
briefs
do
that
there
is
a
less
susceptibility.
there
is
no
--
i
will
argue
with
you
and
to
you
that
there
is
less
susceptibility.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
no
demonstration
that
there
is
anybody
employed
or
about
to
be
employed
in
the
state
university
system
from
which
this
alleged
danger
would
have
occur
that
was
found
to
be
a
fact
in
regard
to
the
public
school
system.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
bigger
or
less
susceptibility
on
the
part
of
students
although
that
is
an
issue
that
can
be
argued
in
terms
of
academic
freedom
that
persons
as
they
grow
older
become
more
mature
and
should
be
able
to
accept
different
points
of
view
much
more
readily
than
innocent
in
younger
school
children.
now,
the
facts
that
occurred
in
regard
to
the
particular
plaintiffs
are
these.
each
of
these
particular
plaintiffs
had
been
employed
by
the
then
university
of
buffalo
in
one
capacity
or
another
at
a
time
when
it
was
the
university
of
buffalo
and
private
institution.
there
were
of
course
was
no
requirement
that
they
subscribe
to
anything,
signed
anything
or
otherwise
provide
any
information
except
as
to
their
professional
competence
or
fitness
to
become
employed
at
the
time
of
hiring.
one
of
them,
plaintiff
starbuck
who
is
treated
somewhat
differently
by
the
state
and
therefore
has
had
a
different
history
in
respect
to
what's
happened
to
him
was
employed
as
a
librarian.
it
is
claimed
by
the
state
and
was
so
found
by
the
court
below
that
his
employment
was
not
an
academic
employment
and
that
therefore
his
employment
was
not
subject
to
section
3021
or
3022
of
the
education
law
but
rather
he
was
in
the
case
of
any
other
civil
servant
of
the
state
of
new
york
under
the
provisions
of
the
civil
service
law
to
be
qualified
or
disqualified
from
employment
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
105
on
new
york
state
civil
service
law.
he
was
asked
after
having
been
employed.
in
other
words,
excuse
me,
after
he
became
employed,
i
must
show
the
correction.
he
was
the
one
person
employed
while
this
institution
was
a
public
university.
he
became
employed
after
the
merger,
the
only
one
of
the
plaintiffs.
and
when
he
was
employed,
he
was
employed
without
any
requirement
that
he
signed
anything
or
answer
anything
but
along
after
several
months
of
employment,
he
was
asked
the
question
that
appears
at
page
65
of
our
brief
and
otherwise
in
the
record
in
which
the
question
based
strictly
upon
the
statutory
provisions
found
in
section
105
and
that
question
was,
“have
you
ever
advised
or
taught
or
were
you
ever
a
member
of
any
society
of
group
of
person
who
taught
or
advocated
the
doctrine
of
the
government
of
united
states
or
of
any
political
subdivision
there
shall
be
--
should
be
overthrown
or
overthrown
by
forced
violence
or
any
other
unlawful
means?”
he
declined
and
refused
to
answer
that
question
whereupon
his
employment
was
threatened
to
be
terminated.
he
in
fact
brought
a
lawsuit
of
his
own
that
is
as
the
sole
plaintiff
in
federal
district
court
to
seek
in
juncture
relief
against
it.
that
lawsuit
was
thereafter
abandoned
in
favor
of
his
becoming
and
joining
as
a
plaintiff
and
this
lawsuit
which
is
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
he
stated
that
he
felt
it
was
an
infringement
upon
his
conscience
and
that
it
was
unconstitutional
requiring
him
to
answer
it.
he
did
this
however
not
before
any
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
well
your
honor,
i
think
his
answer
is
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
he
gives
his
own
statements
which
he
appended
to
the
answers.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no,
sir.
that
was
not
the
issue
at
all
as
far
he
was
concerned.
however,
he
didn't
do
to
support
of
any
hearing.
on
the
back
--
as
i
recalled
on
the
back
of
the
form,
he
put
down
some
reasons
why
he,
george
starbuck
declined
to
answer
this
question.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
have
you
ever
advised
or
taught
or
were
you
ever
a
member
of
any
society
of
group
of
persons
who
taught
or
advocated
the
doctrine
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
be
overthrown
by
the
course
of
violence
or
other
unlawful
means,
and
his
objections
i
can
point
out
to
you
in
a
minute
after
we
check
the
record.
the
other
four
plaintiffs
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
he
made
a
request
for
a
hearing.
yes,
sir.
but
it
was
claimed
that
he's
a
temporary
employee
and
otherwise
that
he
had
no
right
to
a
hearing
on
this
issue.
he
was
temporarily
employed,
it
was
claimed
by
the
state
and
therefore
as
a
temporary
employee
he
had
no
rights
to
hearings
of
any
kind.
the
answer
is
it's
difficult
to
read
but
it's
found
at
exhibit
which
was
contained
at
portfolio
299
of
the
record
where
in
his
own
handwriting,
he
says
that
he
prefers
not
to
answer
or
at
least
into
the
necessity
and
relevance
of
this
question
is
properly
explained
to
me,
initials
g.s.
that's
the
answer
that
he
gave
them.
the
other
four
plaintiffs,
if
i
may
your
honors,
were
all
persons
who
are
employed
as
faculty
members.
let
us
say
teachers
of
one
subject
or
another
in
the
state
university
and
they
declined
to
sign
what
are
known
as
in
this
litigation
and
prior
thereto
the
feinberg
certificates.
now,
the
feinberg
certificates,
your
honors,
are
found
in
our
appendix
at
pages
122
and
123
and
also
in
the
record.
and
the
feinberg
certificates
required
when
presented
to
the
plaintiffs
that
they
sign
after
having
read
the
statements
which
appear
thereupon.
each
of
the
four
plaintiffs
declined
and
refused
to
sign
the
feinberg
certificates.
they
were
threatened
with
the
dismissal
and
i
don't
use
the
word
threatened
in
a
menacing
way,
they
were
told
that
they
were
going
to
be
dismissed
because
there
was
an
obligation
on
their
part
to
sign
this.
they
then
joined
as
plaintiffs
with
starbuck
and
this
lawsuit
was
commenced
seeking
to
declare
the
entire
system
statutes
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
you
mean
where
it's
set
forth,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
lipsitz
it
says
that
at
122
and
123
of
the
brief,
also
your
honor,
we
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no.
that
was
the
one
that
starbuck
was
required
to
sandwich
the
civil
service
questionnaire.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
it's
in
our
brief
which
i
happened
to
have
the
references
to
page
122
and
123.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
you
will
also
find
in
the
record
that
the
identical
documents
that
you
find
in
122
and
123.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
their
grounds
are
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes,
plus
the
fact
that
they
felt
that
it
was
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
involved
in
this
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
there
has
never
been
a
claim
at
any
time
by
anybody
in
the
employment
of
the
state
system
that
there
was
a
fear
of
apprehension
that
these
people
maybe
giving
evidence
against
themselves
by
virtue
of
having
being
required
to
sign
this.
they
did
not
rely
upon
the
fifth
amendment
rights
except
as
far
as
due
process
of
law
is
concerned
and
not
the
self-incrimination.
now,
those
are
the
--
i
think
perhaps
it's
really
fair
to
say
that
the
state
has
through
forbearance
exercise
in
its
part
in
taking
the
position
that
it
would
not
discharge
any
of
the
plaintiffs
except
starbuck
who
was
dismissed
until
this
litigation
is
disposed
of
through
the
court
system,
solely
for
their
failure
to
have
signed
the
certificates.
now
then,
when
this
action
was
commenced
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
well,
one
of
them
was
an
appointment
for
a
year
the
lead
case
keyishian
and
his
employment
was
not
renewed
so
he
is
no
longer
there
but
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
lawsuit
as
to
whether
it
wasn't
renewed
because
of
his
failure
to
sign
it.
the
state
says
that
we
show
under
our
own
procedures
not
to
renew
them
and
one
has
left
voluntarily
to
take
employment
at
another
institution
outside
of
the
state
system
and
that's
plaintiff
maud
and
the
other
two
are
still
there
in
the
sense
of
any
outcome
of
this
lawsuit.
the
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
they
are
threatened
with
discharge
but
that
isn't
the
whole
answer
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
a
minute
but
nevertheless,
they
still
have
this
threat
discharging
over
their
head.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
if
i
will
explain
in
this
fashion.
after
this
lawsuit
was
started,
it
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
any
substantial
question.
it
was
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit,
a
complaint
was
reinstated
by
decision
written
by
justice
marshall
and
it
came
back
and
it
was
tried
before
the
three
men
court.
one
week
before
the
trial
was
to
have
been
commenced
before
the
three
men
court,
the
state
adopted
a
new
policy
for
administering
the
so-called
feinberg
law
and
that
new
policy
is
found
at
pages
124
and
125
of
our
brief
that
is
also
found
elsewhere
in
the
record.
and
that
new
policy
withdraws
the
certificates
so
that
as
of
that
time
although
we
don't
know
and
there's
no
human
being
can
assert
with
the
certainty
that
the
certificate
requirement
will
never
again
in
the
future
will
be
reintroduced
in
the
state
system.
at
that
time,
the
certificates
were
withdrawn
and
in
there
place,
the
procedure
set
forth
was
made
--
the
manner
of
administering
the
feinberg
law
for
the
state
university.
but
in
answer
to
your
question
justice
white,
the
paragraph
which
appears
in
the
middle
of
page
125
reads
that
and
i'm
not
going
to
quote
it
but
nevertheless
that
no
presently
employed
person
and
that
is
to
say
our
plaintiffs
shall
be
deemed
qualified
or
ineligible
“solely
by
reason
to
such
failure”,
referring
to
the
failure
to
sign
the
so-called
feinberg
certificates.
so
this
isn't
out
of
the
case.
this
is
an
element
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
their
continued
future
employment
when
and
if
the
time
comes
that
the
state
is
going
to
determine
as
a
result
of
following
the
conclusion
and
the
decision
in
this
lawsuit
what
to
do
with
this
plaintiffs.
it
says
it
shall
not
solely
be,
it
doesn't
say
shall
not
be
so
that
our
answer
to
the
question
is
they're
still
threatened
and
it
would
be
imminence
of
dismissal
if
this
law
should
be
declared
on
constitution.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no.
we
object
of
course
to
the
new
procedure
as
well
as
to
the
old
procedure
and
we
claim
that
the
laws
are
all
unconstitutional
for
the
reasons
that
we
will
argue
in
the
remaining
time
and
in
the
brief.
they
--
these
new
procedures,
it
does
not
appear
on
the
record
have
or
haven't
been
applied
to
the
present
plaintiffs
and
if
you
will
remember,
they
were
introduced
one
week
before
the
case
was
tried
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
one
way
or
another
to
indicate
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
plaintiffs
if
the
new
procedure
is
to
be
applied
to
them.
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
them
but
they
still
have
to
guide
themselves
according
to
what
they
have
been
told
as
now
the
method
of
enforcing
the
statute.
that
is
to
say
that
they
must
comply
with
in
on
all
time
considered
that
they
are
eligible
to
be
retain
an
employment
only
if
they
understand
and
agree
that
the
rules
of
the
regents
in
the
various
statutes
are
part
of
their
conditions
of
employment.
that's
set
forth
a
new
procedure
so
that
we
don't
rely
just
upon
the
words
solely.
we
rely
upon
the
fact
that
they
too
as
well
as
any
other
employee
of
the
state
university
is
now
subjective
to
this
new
procedure
which
we
don't
claim
or
it's
considered
as
any
as
more
superior
in
a
constitutional
sense
in
the
old
procedure.
now,
those
if
i
may
your
honors,
are
the
facts
that
have
been
involved
in
these
plaintiffs
in
these
cases.
i
like
to
turn
now
to
the
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
if
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
there
has
been
an
expression
by
a
substantial
number
of
faculty
members
some
300
to
400
out
of
a
total
faculty
at
that
institution
of
approximately
a
thousand
that
an
expression
was
took
place
in
the
form
of
a
resolution
condemning
the
requirement
that
they
have
to
comply
with
the
feinberg
law.
only
these
persons,
the
plaintiffs
have
refused
outright
to
comply
with.
they
have
exceeded.
they
have
gone
along.
that
is
to
say
those
employed
at
the
time
went
along
with
it
and
said
rather
than
that
we
will
sign.
now,
we
claim
in
our
briefs
and
we
argue
before
the
court
that
these
statutes
certainly
should
be
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
as
an
infringement
upon
first
amendment
rights
as
a
bill
of
attainder
and
for
lacking
of
due
process
in
regard
to
all
persons
affected
by
these
statutes
including
the
plaintiffs.
we
particularly
argue
in
this
case
of
course
the
current
constitution
in
respect
to
institutions
of
higher
learning
or
reasons
that
there
has
been
no
demonstration
of
any
need
of
going
or
otherwise
to
invade
first
amendment
rights
and
that
there
is
an
expression
joined
quite
imminently
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
since
adler
that
academic
freedom
has
a
right
to
cherish
and
to
be
fully
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
as
--
on
this
--
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
first
amendment
rights
of
these
plaintiffs
are
violated,
we
of
course,
rely
upon
all
of
the
cases
on
this
subject
which
had
been
decided
since
adler
and
which
without
suggesting
to
your
honors
although
the
question
was
asked
that
it
is
necessary
to
overrule
adler
nevertheless
indicate
that
this
court
has
departed
in
some
substantial
measure
from
the
standards
of
adler
and
i
don't
need
only
to
refer
to
the
acknowledgment
of
the
minority
of
this
court
itself
in
the
elfbrandt
decision
were
it
states
and
at
one
portion
of
the
elfbrandt
decision
that
though
the
majority
did
not
purport
to
overrule
or
delimit
adler,
at
the
end
of
the
decision
nevertheless
the
minority
decision
in
effect
says
but
that's
about
what
they
did
by
virtue
of
the
decision.
now,
in
what
fashion
has
this
court
departed
from
what
appears
to
have
been
what
was
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
adler
decision?
the
answer
is
this,
we
think.
firstly,
adler
states
and
it
states
as
plainly
as
can
be
that
there
is
no
right
to
public
employment,
that
if
the
person
doesn't
like
what
he's
required
to
submit
to
as
an
employer
of
the
state,
he
has
a
perfectly
free
choice
to
go
elsewhere.
this
court
and
i
need
not
to
spend
the
time
going
into
the
decisions
that
have
been
written
on
the
subject
as
quite
candidly
and
expressly
stated
in
subsequent
decisions
that
unconditional,
that
unconstitutional
conditions
may
not
be
imposed
upon
public
employment
anymore
than
it
can
be
on
any
other
public
right.
in
the
doctrine
that
if
you
don't
like
what
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
become
employed
by
the
state,
you
can
go
elsewhere
is
no
longer
we
think
the
law
as
expressed
in
a
number
of
cases
decided
subsequent
to
adler.
one
of
which
of
course
elfbrandt
and
other
which
is
the
case
decided
from
oregon
on
the
same
subject
the
baggett
and
bullitt
case.
in
addition
to
which
in
other
areas,
it
has
been
quite
clear
that
the
court
has
apparently
taken
this
position.
but
more
importantly
than
that
and
we
have
attempted
to
analyze
the
complex
questions
that
are
presented
by
the
section
105
requirements
and
we
do
that
starting
at
page
35
through
37
of
our
brief.
the
requirements
imposed
by
section
105
in
new
york
state
civil
service
law
just
as
much
now
as
i
work
for
the
time
of
adler
though
not
brief
nor
argued
before
this
court
as
our
research
indicates
when
adler
was
argued,
the
requirements
of
105
are
so
vague,
are
so
contradictory
and
indeed
are
so
overreaching
in
our
view
that
they
cannot
add
by
themselves
constitutionally
be
sustained
for
instance
and
i
won't
go
into
all
of
the
various
considerations
that
are
present
in
section
105
but
it
appears
that
merely
embracing
the
doctrine,
the
marx's
if
you
will,
the
government
should
be
overthrown
by
force
or
violence
is
a
ground
for
disqualifying
a
person
from
public
employment
not
by
doing
of
an
act
but
the
embracing
of
a
doctrine
and
this
is
as
clear
as
clear
can
be
from
the
provisions
of
section
105
if
one
carefully
reads
and
analyzes
them
an
i
refer
to
the
provisions
of
section
subdivision
1(b).
section
1(b)
of
--
subdivision
1(b)
of
the
civil
service
law
section
105
also
makes
it
unlawful
to
print,
publish,
edit,
issue
or
sell
any
book
in
which
the
doctrine
is
contained.
well,
at
the
same
time
advocating
or
embracing
that
is
to
say
having
the
belief
of
the
duty.
now,
we
say
for
a
variety
of
reasons
the
whole
section
is
unable
to
be
sustained
constitutionally
based
upon
present
standards
of
this
court.
i
would
turn
now
to
the
argument
that
we
think
is
a
key
to
the
decision
of
which
--
when
it
is
made
in
this
case
and
that
is
this.
the
state
has
taken
the
position
very
proudly
that
unlike
other
loyalty
complexes
from
other
states,
new
york
state
has
provided
the
optimum
of
due
process
because
all
that
new
york
state
says
is
that
the
person
who
has
been
or
is
a
member
of
the
subversive
organization,
in
this
case
the
communist
party,
is
only
prima
facie
disqualified
from
either
becoming
employed
or
retaining
employment.
and
by
virtue
of
those
two
words
your
honors,
the
state
claims
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
entire
system
provided
for
under
section
3022.
we
claim
that
this
doctrine
in
a
sense
imposes
an
impossible
burden
upon
the
persons
involved
who
if
some
of
them
were
to
concede
or
admit
that
they
are
members
of
the
communist
party
could
over
--
only
overcome
this
burden
in
the
words
of
the
united
states
--
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
and
one
of
the
three
cases
which
became
known
as
adler.
they
can
only
overcome
it
in
the
following
fashion,
(a)
by
proving
that
the
organization
is
not
subversive
an
impossible
burden
in
any
hearing
because
they
don't
have
acknowledgment
against
the
forces
of
the
state
which
has
already
proved
this
to
its
own
satisfaction,
the
ability
of
the
individual
to
prove
that
it
is
not
subversive
as
an
impossible
burden
or
(b)
denying
membership
or
(c)
denying
knowledge
of
the
aims
and
goals
of
the
organization.
according
to
the
lederman
decision,
one
of
the
three
cases
involved
in
adler,
these
are
the
three
things
that
are
necessary
to
overcome
the
presumption.
there
is
absolutely
had
been
no
consideration
given
to
the
facts
as
evidence
by
the
elfbrandt
decision,
the
aptheker
decision,
the
scales
decision
the
noto
decision
of
this
court
that
innocent
knowing
membership
cannot
be
and
should
not
be
the
grounds
for
disqualifying
anything
neither
employment
as
a
teacher
elfbrandt
nor
ability
to
obtain
a
passport,
aptheker.
the
state
of
new
york
has
said
in
its
right
in
the
decision.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no,
sir.
scales
and
noto
merely
stood
for
the
doctrine
as
we
understand
that
it
takes
more
to
convict
one
of
being
a
member
under
the
membership
clause
than
mere
knowledge
of
the
aims
of
the
organization.
it
must
take
activity
in
pursuance
of
the
unlawful
aims.
the
state
of
new
york
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
you
--
to
overcome
this
presumption,
you
have
to
prove
that
the
organization
wasn't
subversive
that
you
were
a
member
of
it
but
that
you
didn't
know
its
aims
and
to
neglects
completely
to
consider
what
is
now
the
law
as
we
see
it
in
terms
of
the
rights
that
have
been
created
by
these
other
decisions
that
innocent
knowing
membership
cannot
be
the
grounds
for
disqualification
which
is
the
elfbrandt
decision.
now,
we
say
that
the
so
called
doctrine
of
rational
connection
in
this
field
which
has
been
used
to
justify
the
upholding
of
prima
facie
presumptions
if
you
will
and
shifting
the
burdens
to
the
person
seeking
employment
as
a
doctrine
which
not
only
should
not
be
applied
to
the
field
where
the
first
amendment
rights
of
speech
or
association
that
are
involved
but
indeed
there
is
no
rational
connection
between
what
has
being
done
by
the
state
here
and
what
we
claim
as
the
fact
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
state
has
never
demonstrated
that
anything
involving
membership
in
any
organization
is
the
equivalent
of
disqualifying
or
should
be
the
equivalent
of
disqualifying
a
person
from
teaching.
furthermore,
it
is
our
claim,
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
that
the
--
under
the
brown
decision,
the
effect
of
the
state
legislature
in
1958
now
said
that
members
of
the
communist
party
are
ineligible
to
all
office
in
the
state
constitutes
a
bill
of
attainder
and
as
such
it
is
constitutionally
defective.
while
it
is
true
that
the
court
in
adler
upheld
the
proposition
that
an
administrative
agency
could
make
a
finding,
it
did
it
at
a
time
before
it
was
determined
how
it
was
going
to
be
done
and
what
manner
of
means
are
going
to
be
used
as
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
his
dissent
before
the
statute
had
anything
but
its
bare
bones
on
it.
but
in
any
event
when
the
legislature
in
1958
said
legislatively
no
person
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
shall
be
eligible
or
that
is
to
say
membership
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
ineligibility.
the
legislature
said
as
did
the
congress
in
brown
against
the
united
states
that
this
means
a
person
is
ineligible
to
be
employed
in
the
state
university.
we
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
my
answer
is
very
clear,
your
honor.
it
is
not
the
law
and
we
rely
upon
lederman
versus
the
board
of
education,
one
of
the
three
cases
constituting
the
adler
case
where
it
barely
clearly
says
that
all
he
can
do
is
(a)
deny
membership
or
(b)
that
the
organization
advocates
the
overthrow
that
is
to
challenge
the
finding
of
the
board
of
regents
or
that
he
--
or
(c)
that
he
has
knowledge
of
advocacy.
it's
all
he
can
do
to
overcome
the
presumption.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
i
don't
know
upon
what
they
rely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
that's
yes.
it's
lederman
versus
board
of
education.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
it's
one
of
the
three
that's
there
involved
in
the
adler
case.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
i
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
what
it
meant,
your
honors,
because
it
says
so
in
black
and
white
in
their
decision
and
it's
also
stated
at
thompson
against
wallin.
it's
not
as
they
simply
put
it
that
once
somebody
comes
in
and
says
i
didn't
believe
an
advocacy
that
the
presumption
disappears.
that's
just
doesn't
the
way
it
works.
literally
speaking
and
i
quoted
from
lederman
against
board
of
education.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
lederman,
l-e-d-e-r-m-a-n
v.
board
of
education,
your
honor.
it's
cited
to
75
of
my
brief.
it's
one
of
the
three
adler
cases.
the
court
says
quote
referring
to
this
procedure.
“he
may
(a)
deny
membership;
(b)
that
the
organization
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force;
and
(c)
that
he
has
knowledge
of
such
advocacy.”
this
not
this
business
about
coming
in
and
saying
but
i
don't
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
advocacy
or
i
don't
believe
in
the
doctrine
or
advocate
the
doctrine
and
therefore
the
presumption
disappears.
he's
got
--
he's
very
limited
in
what
he
can
do
under
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
interpretation
of
this
section.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
thompson
against
wallin
also.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
thompson
against
wallin
also.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
they
were
the
two
--
the
three
of
them
constituted
to
name
otherwise
the
adler
case.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
and
lederman.
the
same
case.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes,
she
mentioned
thompson
against
wallin
but
they
also
will
tell
you
that
they
rely
upon
lederman
because
lederman
is
one
of
the
three
cases
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
have
stated
in
the
--
mr.
richard
lipsitz
oh,
they
are
decided
the
same
day
and
in
fact
you
can
find
them
in
the
new
york
reports
one
page
after
another.
mr.
richard
lipsitz
yes,
sir.
there's
no
--
and
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
them
by
the
way.
