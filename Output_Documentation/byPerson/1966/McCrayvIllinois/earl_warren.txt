well,
mr.
o'toole,
isn't
there
another
answer
to
that
law
without
disclosing
the
informant?

yesterday
i
understood
you
to
say
that
with
the
--
if
we
set
aside
this
statement
supposedly
made
by
the
informant
to
the
officer,
there
would
not
have
been
probable
cause
shown
in
this
case.
now,
is
it
--
and
in
those
circumstances,
is
it
too
much
to
ask
for
the
government
that
they
prove
their
probable
cause
independently
of
this
statement
that
was
made
to
them
by
the
informant

they're
unwilling
to
produce

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
o'toole,
if
we
agree
with
you,
is
there
any
law,
any
necessity
of
a
police
officer
going
to
a
magistrate
for
a
warrant,
search
warrant
if
he
is
willing
to
testify
without
being
able

without
being
required
to
produce
the
informer
that
he
received
a
tip
to
the
effect
that
this
man
was
a
law
violator.
is
there
any
further
requirement
of
