mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
we
established
that
the
federal
rule
regarding
the
reduction
of
an
informant
in
the
area
of
narcotics
at
the
present
time
is
that
there
must
be
a
balancing
of
the
rights,
that
is
the
rights
of
the
people
and
the
rights
of
the
individual
and
in
relation
to
its
constitutional
guarantees.
and
that
in
the
recent
federal
decisions
that
in
this
area
that
disclosure
of
the
name
or
the
identity
of
the
informant
has
not
been
required
where
the
crime
is
merely
that
of
possession
and
the
individual
that
is
the
informant
did
not
actively
participate
in
the
crime
itself.
going
to
the
rights
of
the
people
and
the
need
we
have
for
nondisclosure
here,
i'm
sure
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no
your
honor,
there
is
no
case
directly
on
point,
the
federal
jurisdiction
that
would
--
that
we
could
use
to
resolve
this
question.
it
is
only
by
dicta
that
we
have
drawn
out
this
reasoning.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
your
honor,
i'm
--
i
could
not
speak
authoritatively
on
that,
it's
exactly
--
there
are
cases
in
the
federal
system,
in
the
courts
of
appeals
which
after
the
decision
in
roviaro
have
come
to
this
conclusion
and
have
interpreted
the
decision
of
this
court
to
me
that
there
need
not
to
be
disclosure
when
we
have
a
nonparticipant
informant
in
a
crime
of
possession.
there
are
several
cases.
i
believe
we
cited
seven
on
page
13
of
our
brief
here
your
honor.
as
to
the
rights
of
the
people
and
in
this
situation,
there's
a
need
that
their
rights
to
be
protected
here
or
there
is
a
necessity
for
informants.
this
court
has
ordered
in
many
occasions
that
significant
percentages
of
arrest
are
based
upon
information
supplied
by
informants.
and
more
important
i
think
is
the
crime
itself
here,
in
any
crime
which
involves
vice,
gambling
or
narcotics.
we
do
not
have
complaining
witnesses
as
we
know
in
a
robbery
case
or
a
crime
of
that
nature.
we
have
willing
participants.
there
is
no
complaining
witness.
i
think
it
was
mr.
chief
justice
clark
who
noted
in
a
dissent
recently
that
informants
are
almost
necessary
when
it
comes
to
this
type
of
crime
because
we
must
fetter
out
the
criminal
through
subterraneous
methods
and
before
we
have
no
complaint
made
by
any
citizen,
the
victim
here
is
a
willing
victim
and
i
think
that
this
crime
should
be
viewed
in
that
way.
if
we
are
required
to
disclose
the
name
and
the
identity
of
an
informant
in
this
situation,
the
effects
would
be
to
negate
the
usefulness
of
informants
in
general.
the
individual
informant
in
any
given
situation
would
be
faced
with
retaliation
and
this
is
been
noted
by
courts
of
all
jurisdictions
as
death
sometimes
follows
and
there
would
be
no
doubt
that
we
would
lose
the
effectiveness
of
this
one
informant.
we
would
lose
the
effectiveness
of
all
informants
for
no
one
would
be
willing
to
come
forth
with
information
and
place
their
life
on
the
line
to
speak
and
there's
no
doubt
that
this
would
happen.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
your
honor,
i
would
say
this,
that
the
government
and
the
people
have
a
right
too
and
has
taken
interest
in
the
situation
calls
for
a
balancing.
if
--
may
i
say
this,
that
here
we
are
presenting
two
diametrically
opposed
views,
one,
where
the
government
says,
absolutely
no
disclosure
and
the
petitioner
is
saying,
full
disclosure.
perhaps
there's
something
that
lies
between
that.
however,
i
don't
feel
that
we
should
talk
about
that
today
because
there
is
a
case
pending
here
for
certiorari
on
the
middle
ground
and
in
camera
hearing
but
there
are
other
methods
also.
there
could
be
opposed
arrest
check
before
a
magistrate
immediately
after
the
individual
is
booked.
but
that
isn't
in
issue
here
but
the
one
thing
that
the
state
of
illinois
is
concerned
is
and
i'm
sure
all
states
in
the
federal
government
concerned
in
is
that
we
do
not
want
to
go
to
the
extreme
that
requires
complete
and
full
disclosure.
there
are
other
means
that
lie
between
the
two
if
that
is
what
the
court
requires
but
that
if
full
disclosure
is
required
that
we
are
going
to
lose
the
effectiveness
of
informants
and
informants
are
necessary
in
this
willing
victim
type
of
crime
that
we
have
here
today.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
cannot
speak
for
other
jurisdictions,
i
was
--
the
state's
attorney's
office
in
cook
county
usually
does
not
use
informants
as
witnesses.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
imagine
that
it
has
been
done
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
in
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
couldn't
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas
in
a
--
on
average
of
two
or
three
years
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
their
effectiveness
does
wear
out
when
they
do
--
become
known
to
some
elements
in
the
community.
if
i
may
digress
for
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
would
be
a
first
statement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
i
think
it
would
help
your
honor.
i
know
mr.
--
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
it
has
not
been
the
policy
in
illinois
to
disclose.
judge
kenneth
wint
(ph)
of
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
excuse
me.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes
your
honor
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
we
noticed
in
the
rugendorf
case
that
the
majority
there
talked
about
the
situation
and
again
by
dicta
because
it
was
not
directly
in
issue
inferred
that
this
disclosure
in
the
roviaro
decision
should
be
applied
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
where
as
this
is
a
preliminary
hearing
on
probable
cause.
we
do
have
to
admit
however
that
it
is
not
clear
at
the
present
time
whether
it
does
or
does
not
apply
to
a
preliminary
hearing
and
probable
cause.
we
would
like
to
see
it
apply
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
believe
the
robinson
case
was
on
the
merits
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
not
in
the
state
of
illinois
your
honor.
well,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
not
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
in
the
state
of
illinois?
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
excuse
me.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
state
of
illinois
at
the
present
time
the
law
is
that
we
are
not
required
to
disclose
under
these
circumstances
whether
it
be
on
preliminary
hearing
or
on
a
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
i
think
that
the
disclosure
should
be
required
where
it
is
necessary
whether
our
facts
which
are
necessary.
the
dissent
the
rugendorf
case
there
pointed
out
three
reasons
why
they
thought
that
disclosure
should
be
required
on
the
trial.
in
that
case,
it
was
merely
constructive
possession.
the
individual
was
tried
upon
having
stolen
first
which
are
found
in
his
basement,
he
was
not
there,
it
was
only
constructive
possession.
the
second
thing
is
four
people
had
access
to
that
basement.
one
of
whom
who
had
been
a
prior
convicted
felon.
and
the
third
thing
is
that
there
was
a
real
possibility
that
he
had
been
out
of
town
at
the
time.
and
that
based
upon
this
factual
element
which
could
be
brought
out,
it
was
required
there
or
so
the
dissent
said
that
the
disclosure
we
made
because
he
could
clarify
--
the
informant
clarify
these
points.
but
we
don't
have
the
situation
here.
what
do
we
have?
the
informant.
what
could
he
tell?
he
could
say,
one,
i
exist.
the
second
thing
is
that
--
excuse
me,
is
that
i
saw
him
selling
narcotics
at
47th
and
calumet
at
five
minutes
to
seven
at
--
the
next
day.
now,
that
would
be
the
totality
of
his
statement.
now,
if
we
go
the
issue
in
which
was
pressed
very
hard
by
the
petitioner
that
we've
got
to
go
to
this
extreme
because
police
lie.
well,
now
if
we
do
have
this
reputable
policeman
and
certainly
their
--
all
men
are
not
all
good,
all
men
are
not
all
evil
but
we
do
have
them.
but
i
think
it's
a
very
small
percentage.
but
if
we
do
have
unscrupulous
police
officer,
isn't
just
as
likely
that
if
he
is
required
to
bring
forward
someone
he
can
bring
forward
some
other
informant
and
tell
him
what
to
say.
we
have
that
possibility.
i
hope
the
court
does
not
build
a
rule
which
requires
complete
disclosure
in
all
cases
in
this
unwilling
victim
situation
based
on
the
possibility
that
there
are
some
police
officers
who
are
unscrupulous
because
they
could
carry
it
one
step
further
and
bring
in
“x”
who
wasn't
even
present
and
say,
"yes,
i
was
the
informer
and
yes,
i
saw
the
petitioner
is
selling
narcotics
at
7:00
in
the
morning".
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
your
honor,
we
go
beyond
the
california
statute.
we
do
not
require
disclosure
whether
it
be
in
a
warrant,
nonwarrant
case
or
whether
it
is
a
preliminary
hearing
or
on
trial
on
the
merits.
in
this
situation
in
the
narcotics
traffic
where
we
have
the
test
of
possession
and
the
nonparticipating
informant,
i
think
illinois
follows
the
rule
laid
down
in
roviaro.
i
think
that's
exactly
the
position
we
take
and
have
taken
consistently
since
people
versus
durr
approximately
1962
or
1963.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice,
i
certainly
think
there
is.
i
think
each
case
has
to
be
viewed
on
its
own
circumstance.
this
court
in
draper
held
that
it
was
--
well,
it
didn't
hold
directly
but
in
that
case,
there
was
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
which
there
was
a
two-day
time
span
and
the
in
--
the
police
officers
did
not
apply
for
a
warrant
and
that
improbable
cause
has
found
a
lie
in
that
case.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have
a
position
where
the
police
officers
came
in
to
the
information
approximately
five
or
10
minutes
to
seven,
the
arrest
was
made
at
7:00.
they
had
no
time
in
which
to
apply
for
a
warrant.
this
is
a
situation
that
was
impossible.
this
individual
was
working
the
street.
if
the
arrest
was
not
made
at
that
time,
the
officers
had
to
determine
if
they
have
probable
cause
in
their
own
mind
according
to
the
rule
of
law
and
that
if
they
did
apply
for
a
search
warrant
he
wouldn't
have
been
at
47th
and
calumet
selling
narcotics.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
we're
talking
about
arrest
warrant.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
arrest
warrants
and
if
i
did
say
search
warrants
please
excuse
me,
i
meant
arrest
warrants.
as
we
have
said
what
the
petitioner
alleges
here
is
that
police
are
unreliable
and
they've
also
interject
the
fact
that
if
we
allege
a
factual
dispute
then
we
have
to
have
an
open
hearing.
if
we
allow
this
to
stand
to
the
position
of
a
factual
dispute
raised
or
a
factual
allegation
raised
to
the
feet,
the
nondisclosure
privilege
of
the
government,
we're
just
going
to
negate
the
entire
matter.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
we
established
that
the
federal

i'm

all
states
in
the
federal
government
concerned
in
is
that
we
do
not
want
to
go
to
the
extreme
that
requires
complete
and
full
disclosure.
there
are
other
means
that
lie
between
the
two
if
that
is
what
the
court
requires
but
that
if
full
disclosure
is
required
that
we
are
going
to
lose
the
effectiveness
of
informants
and
informants
are
necessary
in
this
willing
victim
type
of
crime
that
we
have
here
today.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
cannot
speak
for
other
jurisdictions,
i
was
--
the
state's
attorney's
office
in
cook
county
usually
does
not
use
informants
as
witnesses.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
imagine
that
it
has
been
done
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
in
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
couldn't
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas
in
a
--
on
average
of
two
or
three
years
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
their
effectiveness
does
wear
out
when
they
do
--
become
known
to
some
elements
in
the
community.
if
i
may
digress
for
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
would
be
a
first
statement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
i
think
it
would
help
your
honor.
i
know
mr.
--
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
it
has
not
been
the
policy
in
illinois
to
disclose.
judge
kenneth
wint
(ph)
of
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
excuse
me.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes
your
honor
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
we
noticed
in
the
rugendorf
case
that
the
majority
there
talked
about
the
situation
and
again
by
dicta
because
it
was
not
directly
in
issue
inferred
that
this
disclosure
in
the
roviaro
decision
should
be
applied
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
where
as
this
is
a
preliminary
hearing
on
probable
cause.
we
do
have
to
admit
however
that
it
is
not
clear
at
the
present
time
whether
it
does
or
does
not
apply
to
a
preliminary
hearing
and
probable
cause.
we
would
like
to
see
it
apply
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
believe
the
robinson
case
was
on
the
merits
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
not
in
the
state
of
illinois
your
honor.
well,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
--
not
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
in
the
state
of
illinois?
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
excuse
me.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
state
of
illinois
at
the
present
time
the
law
is
that
we
are
not
required
to
disclose
under
these
circumstances
whether
it
be
on
preliminary
hearing
or
on
a
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
i
think
that
the
disclosure
should
be
required
where
it
is
necessary
whether
our
facts
which
are
necessary.
the
dissent
the
rugendorf
case
there
pointed
out
three
reasons
why
they
thought
that
disclosure
should
be
required
on
the
trial.
in
that
case,
it
was
merely
constructive
possession.
the
individual
was
tried
upon
having
stolen
first
which
are
found
in
his
basement,
he
was
not
there,
it
was
only
constructive
possession.
the
second
thing
is
four
people
had
access
to
that
basement.
one
of
whom
who
had
been
a
prior
convicted
felon.
and
the
third
thing
is
that
there
was
a
real
possibility
that
he
had
been
out
of
town
at
the
time.
and
that
based
upon
this
factual
element
which
could
be
brought
out,
it
was
required
there
or
so
the
dissent
said
that
the
disclosure
we
made
because
he
could
clarify
--
the
informant
clarify
these
points.
but
we
don't
have
the
situation
here.
what
do
we
have?
the
informant.
what
could
he
tell?
he
could
say,
one,
i
exist.
the
second
thing
is
that
--
excuse
me,
is
that
i
saw
him
selling
narcotics
at
47th
and
calumet
at
five
minutes
to
seven
at
--
the
next
day.
now,
that
would
be
the
totality
of
his
statement.
now,
if
we
go
the
issue
in
which
was
pressed
very
hard
by
the
petitioner
that
we've
got
to
go
to
this
extreme
because
police
lie.
well,
now
if
we
do
have
this
reputable
policeman
and
certainly
their
--
all
men
are
not
all
good,
all
men
are
not
all
evil
but
we
do
have
them.
but
i
think
it's
a
very
small
percentage.
but
if
we
do
have
unscrupulous
police
officer,
isn't
just
as
likely
that
if
he
is
required
to
bring
forward
someone
he
can
bring
forward
some
other
informant
and
tell
him
what
to
say.
we
have
that
possibility.
i
hope
the
court
does
not
build
a
rule
which
requires
complete
disclosure
in
all
cases
in
this
unwilling
victim
situation
based
on
the
possibility
that
there
are
some
police
officers
who
are
unscrupulous
because
they
could
carry
it
one
step
further
and
bring
in
“x”
who
wasn't
even
present
and
say,
"yes,
i
was
the
informer
and
yes,
i
saw
the
petitioner
is
selling
narcotics
at
7:00
in
the
morning".
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
your
honor,
we
go
beyond
the
california
statute.
we
do
not
require
disclosure
whether
it
be
in
a
warrant,
nonwarrant
case
or
whether
it
is
a
preliminary
hearing
or
on
trial
on
the
merits.
in
this
situation
in
the
narcotics
traffic
where
we
have
the
test
of
possession
and
the
nonparticipating
informant,
i
think
illinois
follows
the
rule
laid
down
in
roviaro.
i
think
that's
exactly
the
position
we
take
and
have
taken
consistently
since
people
versus
durr
approximately
1962
or
1963.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice,
i
certainly
think
there
is.
i
think
each
case
has
to
be
viewed
on
its
own
circumstance.
this
court
in
draper
held
that
it
was
--
well,
it
didn't
hold
directly
but
in
that
case,
there
was
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
which
there
was
a
two-day
time
span
and
the
in
--
the
police
officers
did
not
apply
for
a
warrant
and
that
improbable
cause
has
found
a
lie
in
that
case.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have
a
position
where
the
police
officers
came
in
to
the
information
approximately
five
or
10
minutes
to
seven,
the
arrest
was
made
at
7:00.
they
had
no
time
in
which
to
apply
for
a
warrant.
this
is
a
situation
that
was
impossible.
this
individual
was
working
the
street.
if
the
arrest
was
not
made
at
that
time,
the
officers
had
to
determine
if
they
have
probable
cause
in
their
own
mind
according
to
the
rule
of
law
and
that
if
they
did
apply
for
a
search
warrant
he
wouldn't
have
been
at
47th
and
calumet
selling
narcotics.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
we're
talking
about
arrest
warrant.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh,
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
arrest
warrants
and
if
i
did
say
search
warrants
please
excuse
me,
i
meant
arrest
warrants.
as
we
have
said
what
the
petitioner
alleges
here
is
that
police
are
unreliable
and
they've
also
interject
the
fact
that
if
we
allege
a
factual
dispute
then
we
have
to
have
an
open
hearing.
if
we
allow
this
to
stand
to
the
position
of
a
factual
dispute
raised
or
a
factual
allegation
raised
to
the
feet,
the
nondisclosure
privilege
of
the
government,
we're
just
going
to
negate
the
entire
matter.
thank
you
very
much.
