you

who
suggested
that?
justice

who

well
of

it's
the
rule
of
the

that
were
handled
by
the

--
who
handles

justice

do
you

any

of

who
in
the

came
to

said,

and
there
you
may
either
have

or
one

less
calling
to
whether
you
let
them
arrange

do
you
think
there's
any
local

in

that
they
try

any

justice

could

for

i
was
asking

about
the
fact
of
this

this

with
this

justice

and
that
matter.
justice

and
that's
all
i
asked
you.
justice

may
i
ask
you?
justice

do
you
think
that
there
was
any
legal
duty
on
the
part
of
the

commissioner
to
go
in
until
they
could
have
an
adversary

and
if
so,
from
what
source
do
that
power
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
the
government
doesn't
want
this
case
filed
in
that
jurisdiction.
they
want
this
tax
question
decided
in
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
has
it
been
--
has
it
been
traditional
to
have
cases
that
involved
tax
question,
decided
the
federal
tax,
decided
in
the
state
court
without
the
federal
government's
consent.
what
bothers
me
is
what
power
do
they
have
affect
of
change
of
jurisdiction
in
where
the
case
should
be
charged
by
summoning
and
underlying
in
the
federal

justice
hugo
l.
black
he
should
but
what
law
requires
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
no
law
requires
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
then
how
can
he
be
force
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
reaches
before
us
now
was
that
third
circuit
is
right.
justice

l.
black
why
does
the

tried
the

justice

why
does

why?
justice

how
can
it

if
there's

state
court
decides
and
the
government
accepts
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
deciding
a
law
of
that
case
but
it's
quite
different
when
you
try
to
drag
the
government
in
to
try
a
case
in
state
court
which
basically
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
involved
nothing
but
it'd
like
to
collect
the
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
you
say
it
is
and
they
gave
that
to
exempt
it,
a
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
hold
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
a
question
on
which
government
tax
depends.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
federal
government
go
in
as
a
defendant
in
it?
justice
hugo

black
in
the
divorce

justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
have
dragged
him
into
the
divorce
case
because
it
was
going
to
affect
the
government's
taxes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
government
agreeing
to
go
in
and
try.
that
raises
quite
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
government
being
forced
to
come
in
and
against
its
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
might
and
you
might
not
because
you
might
not
only
try
in
that
jurisdiction
that
the
jurisdiction
amounts
to,
allowed
it
on
a
certain
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
might
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
choose
to
be
so
but
where
do
you
get
your
authority
and
in
its
federal
statutes
purports
the
government
to
go
in
and
litigate
it
because
it
incidentally
involved
its
tax
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
state
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
sure,
but
that's
the
issue
we
have
before,
seven
other
circuits
have
decided
the
point
here,
have
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
one
circuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
i'm
asking
is
where
they
got
their
power
to
force
the
federal
government
to
go
in
and
litigate
its
tax
question
which
incidentally
affects
its
tax
in
the
state
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
what
i
wanted
to
find
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
government
--
if
the
state
court
had
ruled
in
this
case
that
the
power
--
that
the
release
of
the
power
of
appointment
was
valid,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
necessary
the
appellate
in
effect
that
the
federal
government
law
recognizes
that
state
law
governs
with
reference
to
the
ownership
of
property
that
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
state
court
can
drag
the
government
in
to
try
that
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i've
gathered
from
a
question
i
asked
you
that
have
indicated
that
that's
enough
to
authorize
the
suit
against
the
government
to
the
federal
court
to
where
that
state
law
governs
the
ownership
of
property
in
connection
with
taxation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
so
do
i.
i
agree
with
you
but
does
it
follow
from
that,
that
that
means
that
the
federal
government
has
consented
to
be
sued
in
the
state
court
either
directly
or
incidentally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
there's
wrong
on
that.
and
this
case
is
still
open,
that
point
is
still
open,
the
decision
here
now
by
in
that
all
you
want.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
be
true
that
question
is
open
for
us
to
decide
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
as
it
was
raised
about
what
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
--
but
if
it
be
true,
because
what
the
purport
of
brother
brennan's
question,
but
that
question
is
open
now,
here,
why
should
it
be
remanded
for
that
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it.
i
understand
it
but
if
you
are
conceding
that,
i'm
not
sure
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
he
did
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he's
conceding
that,
does
not
get
precisely
what
you're
asking
for
except
that
it's
said
to
being
remanded,
the
court
might
pass
on
it.

the
ownership
of
property
in
connection
with
taxation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
so
do
i.
i
agree
with
you
but
does
it
follow
from
that,
that
that
means
that
the
federal
government
has
consented
to
be
sued
in
the
state
court
either
directly
or
incidentally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
there's
wrong
on
that.
and
this
case
is
still
open,
that
point
is
still
open,
the
decision
here
now
by
in
that
all
you
want.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
be
true
that
question
is
open
for
us
to
decide
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
as
it
was
raised
about
what
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
--
but
if
it
be
true,
because
what
the
purport
of
brother
brennan's
question,
but
that
question
is
open
now,
here,
why
should
it
be
remanded
for
that
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it.
i
understand
it
but
if
you
are
conceding
that,
i'm
not
sure
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
he
did
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he's
conceding
that,
does
not
get
precisely
what
you're
asking
for
except
that
it's
said
to
being
remanded,
the
court
might
pass
on
it.
