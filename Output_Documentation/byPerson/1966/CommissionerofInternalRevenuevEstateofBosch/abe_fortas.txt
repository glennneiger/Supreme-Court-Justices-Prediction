justice

fortas
well
he
did
include
this
position
on
page

justice
abe
fortas
i
said
the
testator
did
include
that
provision
on
page
12
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
presents
troublesome
problem
because
that
provision
does
say
that
is
flatly
as
a
loose
language
could
that
the
provisions
of
any
statute
require
a
proration
of
taxes
should
be
without
effect
in
the
settlement
of
a
man's
estate.
justice
abe
fortas
and
even
though
it
had
not
been
appealed
beyond
the
probate
court?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
would
accept
as
conclusive
for
this
purpose
a
judgment
of
the
connecticut
probate
court
provided
that
where
an
adversary
proceeding
such
a
proceeding
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
levin,
you're
taking
the
position
if
i
understand
you
that
even
if
the
connecticut
court
is
wrong,
that
you'd
be
bound
by
connecticut
by
its
decision,
provided
these
were
an
adversary
proceeding,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
if
it's
wrong
has
got
to
do
with
anything?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
in
effect
that
you
--
we
don't
need
all
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
that's
an
effect
that
you
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
government's
perfectly
willing
to
accept
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
this
was
a
bona
fide
proceeding
in
the
probate
court,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
try
and
get
a
little
more
--
let's
say
a
leeway.
justice
abe
fortas
where
in
service
made
on
the
district
director
of
irs
here?
justice
abe
fortas
at
a
probate
court
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
and
a
decision
was
made
not
to
participate.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
when
it
was
made
but
whenever
it
was
made,
the
decision
was
made
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
not
to
participate.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
take
it
on
the
other
side
that
in
the
probate
proceeding,
i
have
forgotten
what
connecticut
probate
procedure
is.
but
in
the
probate
proceeding
i
don't
--
the
irs
and
the
district
director
were
not
joined
as
a
party,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
whether
you
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
did
--
but
they
did
serve?
justice
abe
fortas
oh
but
it
seems
--
but
it
seems
to
there,
i
understand
that
there
are
lots
of
time
here
and
that
the
government's
position
may
have
changed
that
you
come
--
you
come
in
here
now
and
say
that
if
it's
an
adversary
position,
you
would
accept
the
decision
of
the
connecticut
probate
court,
good,
better,
indifferent,
right,
or
wrong,
and
the
district
director
in
our
opportunity
to
litigate
this
question.
now,
maybe
at
that
time
the
government's
position
was
not
formulated
in
this
one.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
other
situation
in
which
important
governmental
decision
that
you
know
of,
a
decision
federal
government
as
to
whether
it
will
or
will
not
accept
the
state
court
decision
turns
on
the
question
of
whether
the
proceeding
is
adversary
in
the
sense
that
you
describe
here.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
question
of
deciding
whether
a
proceeding
is
truly
as
distinguished
from
formally
adversary.
this
is
i'm
sure
you
realized
the
very
difficult
tricky
question
for
example
in
the
field
of
the
divorce
law
and
domestic
relations.
adversary
proceedings
are
accepted
as
such.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
nothing
more
than
a
matter
of
complying
with
the
few
formal
items.
justice
abe
fortas
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
saying
that
probate
proceedings
should
be
--
should
not
be
accepted
as
finding
for
tax
purposes
because
it
is
nonadversary.
i'm
saying
that
under
a
probate
proceeding,
the
usual
family
situation
can
never
be
adversary.
and
i
suspect
that
what
you're
doing
really
is
taking
the
later
position
saying,
"well
i
accept
the
probate
court
decision."
where
the
sort
of
impossible
exists
and
that
is
where
there
is
a
family
dispute
in
the
courtroom.
this
is
adversary
in
the
sense
that
the
parties
with
different
interests
are
all
before
the
court.
and
what
do
you
expect
them
to
do?
fight
when
they
don't
disagree?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
what
could
--
what
could
have
happened
if
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
have
determined
that
among
themselves.
and
the
court
has
made
an
order
here.
and
the
parties
then
--
you're
saying
that
the
--
it
sounds
to
me
that
you're
saying
the
commissioner
will
accept
this
and
to
whether
the
parties
are
in
disagreement
where
one
will
accept
it
when
the
parties
are
in
agreement.
justice
abe
fortas
here,
you're
exactly
saying
the
same
thing.
there's
got
to
be
a
difference
of
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
order
for
it
to
be
an
adversary
proceedings
but
suppose
there's
not,
then
they
can't
be
an
adversary
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
where
is
it
in
your
brief
within
that
mr.
levin
in
support
of
what
you
have
now
described
as
the
commissioner's
position.
justice
abe
fortas
i
find
this
very
difficult
position
that
the
courts
said
because
--
well
i
think
i
would
pretty
clearly
conclude
that
the
federal
government
cannot
be
compelled
to
accept
the
result
of
the
state
courts
in
the
tax
fee.
i
think
i
would
feel
--
i
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
government
cannot
be
compelled
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
federal
government
takes
the
position
that
in
making
this
kind
of
tax
decision,
it
wants
to
accept
the
state
court
decision.
i
have
some
problem
with
the
--
ours
telling
that
the
federal
government
that,
"no,
you
may
not
accept
the
state
court
decision
here."
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
provision
that's
been
put
to
us
is
the
brief
and
argument
is
it
seems
to
me
distinctly
equivocal.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
levin,
am
i
correct
in
that
judge
friendly
put
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
this
issue
was
had
that
the
court
decision,
new
york
court
decision
in
this
case,
had
no
purpose
except
to
affect
tax
liability?
that
is
to
say
that
the
parties
just
decided
that
they
present
this
question
to
the
new
york
supreme
court
for
the
purpose
of
contending
a
determination
which
would
affect
tax
liability
and
your
adversary
of
the
preceding
case,
i
don't
know
if
this
is
right
or
not,
suggested
that
the
connecticut
probate
court
in
the
ordinary
course
of
its
administration
had
to
decide
the
issue
which
affected
tax
liability.
justice

fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
here
is
again
--
that
you're

that
the

be
whether
the

that

issue
should
be

deduction
is

that
is

determination
by
the

do
you
take

position
that
it

in
adversary
state
court
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
may
be
a
little
overstatement.
i
don't
know
what
matter
it
is

adversary
now
the

said

connecticut
