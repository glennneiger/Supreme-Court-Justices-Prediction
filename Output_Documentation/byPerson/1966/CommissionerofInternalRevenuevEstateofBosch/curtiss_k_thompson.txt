mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
pleases.
this
suit
for
the
recovery
of
federal
estate
taxes
depends
on
the
final
analysis
upon
how
much
property
the
widow
of
the
decedent
receives
under
a
residuary
bequest.
the
petition
for
certiorari
presented
two
questions
for
review.
first,
whether
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
holding
that
estate
taxes
should
not
be
apportioned
between
the
widow
and
the
grandchildren,
who
were
the
other
residuary
legatees,
was
in
conflict
with
the
law
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
and
the
second
question
is
whether
or
not
the
decree
of
the
probate
court
which
decided
the
matter
differently
than
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
binding
in
conclusive
upon
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
brewster,
when
he
made
his
will
gave
one-third
of
the
residue
to
his
widow
in
trust,
and
two-thirds
to
nine
grandchildren
each
in
a
separate
trust.
his
will
contained
a
tax
clause
which
your
honors
will
find
printed
on
page
12
of
the
record,
it
was
article
i
of
the
will,
and
which
is
a
little
long
to
read.
the
--
it's
noteworthy
that
these
two
residuary
bequests
to
the
widow
and
the
grandchildren,
when
the
will
was
made,
were
equally
taxable.
therefore,
it
made
no
difference
whether
the
testator
directed
that
these
estate
taxes
should
be
apportioned
between
the
residuary
bequests
or
whether
he
directed
differently.
the
estate
would
have
been
distributed
in
the
same
manner.
but
mr.
brewster
made
a
codicil
to
his
will.
and
when
he
did
that,
he
ordered
the
bequest
to
the
widow,
which
as
i
said
was
in
trust,
so
that
it
qualified
for
the
marital
deduction
and
became
tax
exempt.
now,
as
soon
as
that
change
was
made,
it
became
important
to
both
the
widow
and
to
the
grandchildren
as
to
whether
or
not
the
estate
taxes
were
to
be
apportioned
or
prorated
between
them
because
the
widow's
gift
at
that
point
was
tax
exempt.
now,
if
you
had
a
proration
between
those
two
gifts,
the
widow
would
bear
no
part
of
the
estate
taxes
under
residuary
bequests,
or
under
residual
properties.
if
there
was
no
proration,
she
would
thus
the
tax
clause
which
was
written
when
this
--
when
it
gets
briefly
taxable.
and
when
the
testator
did
not
have
this
problem
in
mind
and
did
not
speak
to
it,
the
question
becomes
whether
that
tax
clause
or
what
the
effect
of
this
act
to
the
codicil
he
had
written.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
when
he
wrote
codicil
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
yes.
yes,
he
wanted
to
make
the
gift
to
the
widow
tax
exempt.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
codicil,
yes.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
yes.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
that's
right.
now,
i
think
i
ought
to
make
it
clear
just
exactly
what
taxes
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
not
speaking
of
the
connecticut
succession
tax
which
is
the
chief
death
duty
in
connecticut.
that
is
not
involved
here
at
all.
we're
speaking
only
of
the
estate
taxes,
and
only
of
such
--
only
about
such
part
of
them
as
arise
out
of
the
residual
properties.
for
example,
the
widow's
gift
is
nontaxable.
that
generates
no
estate
taxes.
the
gifts
to
the
grandchildren
are
taxable.
therefore,
the
properties
distributed
to
them
generate
taxes.
also,
out
for
the
residue,
a
very
substantial
sum
of
money
was
paid
for
death
duties.
those
death
duties,
of
course,
are
not
deductible
items
in
computing
taxes.
therefore,
the
moneys
that
we
use
for
the
payment
of
the
death
duties
also
generate
estate
taxes
and
they
are
involved
here.
the
executers,
of
course,
were
aware
of
the
problem
that
faced
them
in
this
matter
and
of
the
importance
of
it
to
the
widow
and
to
the
grandchildren
because
the
sums
involved
were
substantial.
the
executives
first
have
to
deal
with
the
problem
when
they
filed
their
federal
estate
tax
return.
and
they
computed
their
tax
obligations
there
on
the
premise
that
no
part
of
these
taxes,
which
i
have
described
were
to
be
born
by
the
widow
and
that
all
were
to
be
paid
out
of
the
grandchildren's
share.
the
internal
revenue
service
could
not
agree
with
that
treatment.
and
eventually,
they
said
that
a
deficiency
would
be
assessed
on
that
account.
now,
such
a
deficiency,
as
i
indicated
in
my
opening
sentence,
turns
entirely
upon
the
law
of
connecticut
and
upon
the
amount
of
money
that
is
distributable
under
connecticut
law
to
the
will.
it
does
not
involve
any
interpretation
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
at
the
time
that
the
executor's
and
internal
revenue
service
joined
the
issue
on
this
matter,
three
years
gone
by
since
the
testators'
death.
it
was
obvious
to
the
executor's
that
the
matter
was
going
to
have
to
be
settled
and
was
going
to
have
to
be
settled
by
a
connecticut
court.
so
at
that
time
--
excuse
me
a
moment
--
the
executor's
filed
their
first
accounting.
i
should
say
in
connecticut
that
all
the
states
have
judicial
counties.
they
filed
that
first
accounting
which
showed
the
payment
of
all
of
the
death
duties
that
had
been
assessed
at
that
time.
this
was
a
statutory
obligation
of
the
executor's.
they
also
accompanied
their
administration
account
with
a
petition
to
the
court
to
rule
on
this
matter
concerning
the
proration
of
estate
taxes.
and
accompanying
that
petition,
they
filed
a
proposed
computation
of
the
tax
following
the
same
premise
that
they
had
used
in
their
federal
estate
tax
return.
now,
the
government
seems
to
think
that
in
doing
that,
the
executor's
were
engaging
in
some
slick
trick.
it's
not
clear
from
the
government's
brief
but
the
implication
i
think
is,
that
the
executor's
should
not
have
taken
this
matter
to
the
fede
--
to
the
probate
court
but
should
have
let
it
to
the
decision
perhaps
of
some
federal
tribunal
which
one
i
don't
know.
certainly,
the
district
court
has
no
probate
jurisdiction
and
neither
does
the
tax
court.
the
executor's
and
i
wish
to
make
this
abundantly
clear,
had
no
alternative
but
to
ask
the
probate
court
to
do
this
because
it
involved
an
adjudication
of
property
rights
under
the
law
of
connecticut
and
under
the
decedent's
will.
the
executor's
would
not
have
been
able
to
charge
these
taxes
that
are
in
question
against
either
the
widow
or
against
the
grandchildren
without
having
obtained
an
order
from
the
probate
court.
and
if
you
examined
the
decree
that
was
finally
issued,
you
will
see
that
it
authorizes
the
executor's
to
make
charges
for
these
taxes
against
the
grandchildren's
share.
the
--
at
one
point
in
its
brief,
the
government
states
that
this
was
an
effort
to
avoid
estate
taxes
on
the
part
of
the
executor's,
but
that
is
not
true.
it
was
a
vital
step
necessary
to
the
settlement
of
the
state
unless
the
executors
wish
to
accept
personal
responsibility
for
whatever
decision
they
make.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
the
executor's
were
required
by
statute
to
file
a
proposed
computation
of
the
prorates.
and
they
did
file
such
a
proposed
computation
and
then
a
sense
that
is
a
petition
--
a
position.
i
don't
think
that
after
the
executor's
have
discharged
that
initial
duty,
they
have
any
responsibility
other
than
to
explain
the
matter
for
the
probate
court
because
the
interested
parties,
the
parties
who
are
either
gone
to
win
or
lose
as
a
result
of
the
property
--
of
the
determination
of
their
property
rights
are
the
ones
involved.
so
the
probate
court
schedule,
the
hearing
on
this
petition,
and
notice
was
given
to
the
widow
and
to
the
adult
grandchildren,
there
were
two
of
them,
and
to
the
guardian
ad
litem
who
represented
seven
minor
grandchildren
and
he
also
appeared
for
the
unknown
remainderman
of
the
trusts.
also
in
conformity
with
connecticut
probate
practice,
there
was
a
newspaper
publication
of
the
hearing
because
our
probate
proceedings
are
supposed
to
be
in
rem
in
character
and
notice
is
given
to
the
world.
also
notice
of
this
hearing
was
given
to
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue.obviously,
all
parties
as
well
as
the
judge
were
aware
of
the
incidental
effect
that
this
determination
of
property
rights
would
have
upon
the
calculation
of
the
estate
tax.
notice
was
given
to
the
district
director
and
he
was
provided
with
the
copy,
the
copies
of
the
executor's
petition
and
the
computation
was
stay
at
filed.
the
hearing
was
held
on
november
27,
1961.
the
executives
appeared
by
counsel
and
submitted
the
brief
justifying
or
explaining
the
position
which
they
had
taken.
the
widow
did
not
appear
and
neither
did
the
adult
grandchildren
and
neither
do
the
district
director
of
internal
revenues.
the
guardian
ad
litem
did
appear.
this
was
on
november
27th.
after
the
hearing,
time
was
allowed
to
guardian
for
filing
a
report.
and
he
did
file
a
report
dated
december
22nd
in
which
--
which
is
in
the
record.
and
in
which
he
said
that
he
had
considered
this
matter,
and
despite
the
adverse
financial
affect
upon
the
--
his
words
rights,
he
thought
that
the
computation
that
had
been
made
by
the
executor's
was
the
proper
one
to
make
under
connecticut
law.
the
report
that
he
filed
--
he
filed
a
formal
report
and
he
also
filed
a
letter.
he
submitted
a
letter
to
the
judge
explaining
his
position.
and
soon
after
that,
if
not
immediately,
the
judge
of
probate
passed
his
order
and
issued
a
short
memorandum
from
which
it
appears
that
he
clearly
understood
all
of
the
issues
that
were
involved,
he
understood
the
importance
of
the
property
rights
that
were
at
stake
and
he
understood
too
the
effect
that
this
would
have
upon
federal
taxes.
and
he
cited
in
his
memorandum
the
leading
connecticut
authorities
on
the
question
and
said
that
the
computation
as
submitted
by
the
executors
was
correct,
and
he
ordered
that
the
bequest
of
the
grandchildren
be
charged
with
these
taxes
and
were
attributable
to
the
residuary
properties.
now,
the
law
of
connecticut
on
this
matter
is
rather
simple.
and
i
think
the
law
of
connecticut
agrees
with
the
law
in
most
of
the
states
where
they
have
apportionment
statutes
at
least
it's
identical
with
the
law
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
that
is
the
--
the
law
is
this
that
the
apportionment
statute
was
enacted
to
achieve
equitable
and
remedial
ends.
that's
a
fair
thing
because
it
places
upon
each
legacy
the
portion
of
the
estate
taxes
that
where
legacy
generates.
therefore,
the
court
says
that
while
the
testator
may
direct
against
apportionment,
if
he
wants
to
make
a
direction,
his
words
must
be
so
clear
that
all
doubt
as
to
the
extent
and
limitation
of
his
command
must
be
completely
dispelled.
i
have
quoted
pretty
exactly,
i
think
some
language
from
one
of
the
connecticut
decisions,
the
common
way
of
expressing
the
same
concept
is
that
the
language
of
the
exe
--
of
the
testator
must
be
clear
and
unambiguous.
in
the
first
case
that
came
up
in
connecticut,
there
was
a
direction
on
the
will,
pay
all
taxes
out
of
the
residue.
in
that
case,
it
happened
that
the
testator
had
constructed
some
inter
vivos
trusts
and
a
question
arose
as
to
whether
or
not
the
residuary
estate
should
pay
the
tax
on
the
inter
vivos
trusts.
and
the
court
said,
"no!
he
hadn't
been
specific
about
this."
he
said
all
taxes
be
paid
out
of
the
residue
but
he
didn't
say
that
the
taxes
on
the
inter
vivos
trust
should
be
taken.
then
there
is
the
leading
case
in
connecticut
new
york
trust
versus
doubleday,
where
again
the
testator
said,
"pay
all
of
the
debt
taxes
out
of
the
residue."
and
the
same
question
that
arose
there
arose
here.
it
was
a
gift
to
the
widow
that
qualified
for
a
tax
exemption
in
the
residue.
and
the
court
said
that
the
direction
to
pay
all
taxes
out
of
the
residue
was
not
a
direction
against
proration
within
the
--
or
between
the
residuary
gifts.
and
in
the
doubleday
case,
the
widow's
gift
was
born
no
part
of
these
estate
taxes.
now,
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
the
will
of
the
testator
when
it
was
made
or
when
he
made
that
will,
the
problem
of
proration
between
the
residuary
gifts
was
not
at
issue
or
in
his
mind
at
all.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
that
was
--
that
was
in
his
will.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
yes.
and
it
was
not
changed
by
the
codicil.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
well,
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
or
as
i
understand
it
has
really
been
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
where
there
was
a
case
that
is
very
similar
to
this
that
arose
in
connection
with
mr.
schubert's
will.
he
had
a
tax
clause
that
directed
payment
out
of
the
residue.
and
the
residue
of
his
estate,
there
were
four
trusts.
he
made
a
codicil.
and
as
a
result
of
a
codicil,
one
more
of
those
trusts
became
charitable
in
nature
and
therefore
tax
exempt.
and
the
question
was
what
effect
did
his
tax
clause
have
after
the
codicil
was
executed
and
these
trusts
became
tax
exempted?
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
said
that
that
tax
clause
could
not
be
read
to
direct
the
accomplishment
of
an
object
that
was
totally
unnecessary
when
it
was
written.
in
other
words,
the
schubert
wills,
there
was
no
occasion
for
proration
between
the
residuary
gifts
when
the
will
became
exe
--
was
executed.
that
became
important
only
after
the
codicil.
the
schubert
decree
--
schubert
judgment,
opinion
had
not
been
decided
when
the
probate
judge
acted
on
this
matter.
but
it
was
decided
by
the
time
that
the
--
that
this
case
reached
the
district
court.
and
of
course,
it's
one
of
the
authorities
which
that
court
relied
upon
because
of
its
close
similarity
to
this
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
case
went
there,
they
didn't
recognize
and
i
submit
this
with
all
due
respect.
they
didn't
recognize
the
connecticut
law
which
said
that
as
soon
as
you
have
a
doubt
as
to
what
the
testator's
intention
were
with
respect
to
this
matter,
you
do
not
resolve
the
doubt
by
the
process
of
construction.
rather
you
let
the
apportionment
statute
operate
because
that
achieves
an
equitable
end.
so
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
and
my
brothers
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
attempt
to
circumvent
the
connecticut
law
by
the
process
of
construction.
they
do
so
admittedly.
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
its
own
opinion
as
one
construing
the
will.
and
they
did
it
in
such
fashion
as
this.
the
testator
when
he
executed
the
codicil
had
ample
opportunity
to
provide
for
a
special
tax
treatment
for
his
widow
if
he
chose
to
do
so.
i
don't
know
on
what
facts
that
statement
is
founded,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
it,
but
the
important
points
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
is
that
it's
not
special
tax
treatment
for
the
will.
it's
the
ordinary
tax
treatment.
it's
the
tax
treatment
which
the
legislature
of
connecticut
said
she
was
entitled
to
have
unless
there's
this
specific
direction
to
the
contrary.
the
court
of
appeals
also
said,
"we
don't
think
that
the
testator
wanted
such
gross
disproportion
between
his
widow's
one-third
share
and
the
children's."
and
of
course,
it
doesn't
work
out
on
a
one-third
and
two-thirds
basis
if
the
children
pay
all
the
taxes.
but
they
don't
recognize
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
and
actually,
the
converse
is
that
the
widow
would
pay
one-third
of
all
the
taxes
that
were
generated
by
the
gifts
to
the
children.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
in
conflict
with
the
established
law
of
connecticut,
the
law
as
established
by
our
own
supreme
court
and
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
for
that
account.
in
our
reply
brief,
i
mentioned
collaterally
that
we
have
a
situation
here
where
we
had
a
guardian
ad
litem
and
we
have
a
probate
judge
and
we
have
a
district
judge,
all
highly
experienced
and
capable
connecticut
lawyers.
and
they
all
saw
eye-to-eye
on
this
proposition
which
strikes
me
as
being
something
pertinent.
i
notice
my
white
light
is
signaled.
the
government
here
has
changed
its
base
a
little
bit
so
far
as
the
second
question
is
concerned
and
the
government
itself
is
now
asking
that
the
decision
of
the
court
--
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
sent
back
for
determination
as
to
whether
this
was
an
adversary
or
nonadversary
proceeding.
i've
explained
our
position
on
that
in
our
brief.
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
the
probate
court
or
the
decision
of
any
state
court
should
be
respected
by
the
internal
revenue
service
if
it
is
an
honest
exercise
of
the
judicial
function.
if
it's
something
less
than
that,
then
it's
not
a
good
determination
of
property
rights.
but
so
long
as
it
determines
those
property
rights
knowingly
and
with
an
awareness
of
all
the
issues,
and
all
the
cases
that
decision
so
stand.
the
government
says,
"we
produce
some
cases
in
our
footnotes
here
which
were
never
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
probate
judge."
if
those
cases
were
of
any
importance,
we
might
expect
to
find
them
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals.
but
out
of
11
cases
cited
by
the
government,
only
one
appears
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
decisions
which
the
government
is
referring
to
recite
the
usual
tenants
of
construction
about
the
intent
of
the
testator
and
so
forth
and
i
say
seriously
that
despite
the
three
briefs
that
had
been
written
on
this
subject,
the
government
--
government's
counsel
with
all
their
ability
have
been
unable
to
cite
one
single
case
which
militates
against
the
decision
of
the
probate
court
and
of
the
federal
district
court.
i
may
have
save
a
minute
or
two
for
reply.
i
hope
so.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
may
i
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question?
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
the
effect
of
the
probate
decree,
the
probate
court
adjudicated
the
property
rights
of
the
widow
and
the
grandchildren,
and
the
remainderman
of
the
cost.
and
that
decree
is
binding
and
the
probate
court
cannot
modify
it
nor
so
far
as
i
can
see
can
any
court
in
the
land.
that's
a
final
decision.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
well,
the
grandchildren
will
get
less.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
the
government
has
received
the
million
dollars.
in
effect,
it
has
taken
that
away
--
in
effect,
it
wants
to
take
it
away
from
that
widow.
under
the
probate
decree,
it
will
be
charged
against
the
grandchildren.
now
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
unless
the
decree
is
reversed.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
the
petition
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
i
think
it's
been
made
largely,
your
honor.
we
don't
--
in
our
probate
--
probate
practice
doesn't
require
under
these
circumstances
at
least
an
order
of
distribution.
the
will
itself
authorizes
the
executors
to
make
the
distribution.
and
i'm
sure
that
by
this
time,
the
grandchildren's
trusts
have
been
established
to
the
extent
that
they
can
be.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
not
entirely,
no.
no
because
we're
seeking
--
we're
seeking
this
refund.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
but
we
have
--
we
pay
all
of
the
taxes
that
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
--
around
the
horizon.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
and
we
had
paid
all
of
the
taxes
at
the
time
that
the
probate
decree
was
entered
with
the
exception
of
this
deficiency.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
this
is
a
suit
for
a
refund.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
a
refund
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
the
probate
decree
has
said
charge
these
taxes
against
the
grandchildren.
and
the
--
the
--
the
liability
of
the
parties
for
the
--
for
the
taxes
has
already
been
determined
and
has
been
performed
than
discharge
so
that
it
goes
back
into
the
estate.
and
it
should
be
divided
between
all
the
legatees.
thank
you.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
pleases.
this
suit
for
the
recovery
of
federal
estate
taxes
depends
on
the
final
analysis
upon
how
much
property
the
widow
of
the
decedent
receives
under
a
residuary
bequest.
the
petition
for
certiorari
presented
two
questions
for
review.
first,
whether
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
holding
that
estate
taxes
should
not
be
apportioned
between
the
widow
and
the
grandchildren,
who
were
the
other
residuary
legatees,
was
in
conflict
with
the
law
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
and
the
second
question
is
whether
or
not
the
decree
of
the
probate
court
which
decided
the
matter
differently
than
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
binding
in
conclusive
upon
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
brewster,
when
he
made
his
will
gave
one-third
of
the
residue
to
his
widow
in
trust,
and
two-thirds
to
nine
grandchildren
each
in
a
separate
trust.
his
will
contained
a
tax
clause
which
your
honors
will
find
printed
on
page
12
of
the
record,
it
was
article
i
of
the
will,
and
which
is
a
little
long
to
read.
the
--
it's
noteworthy
that
these
two
residuary
bequests
to
the
widow
and
the
grandchildren,
when
the
will
was
made,
were
equally
taxable.
therefore,
it
made
no
difference
whether
the
testator
directed
that
these
estate
taxes
should
be
apportioned
between
the
residuary
bequests
or
whether
he
directed
differently.
the
estate
would
have
been
distributed
in
the
same
manner.
but
mr.
brewster
made
a
codicil
to
his
will.
and
when
he
did
that,
he
ordered
the
bequest
to
the
widow,
which
as
i
said
was
in
trust,
so
that
it
qualified
for
the
marital
deduction
and
became
tax
exempt.
now,
as
soon
as
that
change
was
made,
it
became
important
to
both
the
widow
and
to
the
grandchildren
as
to
whether
or
not
the
estate
taxes
were
to
be
apportioned
or
prorated
between
them
because
the
widow's
gift
at
that
point
was
tax
exempt.
now,
if
you
had
a
proration
between
those
two
gifts,
the
widow
would
bear
no
part
of
the
estate
taxes
under
residuary
bequests,
or
under
residual
properties.
if
there
was
no
proration,
she
would
thus
the
tax
clause
which
was
written
when
this
--
when
it
gets
briefly
taxable.
and
when
the
testator
did
not
have
this
problem
in
mind
and
did
not
speak
to
it,
the
question
becomes
whether
that
tax
clause
or
what
the
effect
of
this
act
to
the
codicil
he
had
written.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
when
he
wrote
codicil
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
yes.
yes,
he
wanted
to
make
the
gift
to
the
widow
tax
exempt.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
codicil,
yes.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
yes.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
that's
right.
now,
i
think
i
ought
to
make
it
clear
just
exactly
what
taxes
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
not
speaking
of
the
connecticut
succession
tax
which
is
the
chief
death
duty
in
connecticut.
that
is
not
involved
here
at
all.
we're
speaking
only
of
the
estate
taxes,
and
only
of
such
--
only
about
such
part
of
them
as
arise
out
of
the
residual
properties.
for
example,
the
widow's
gift
is
nontaxable.
that
generates
no
estate
taxes.
the
gifts
to
the
grandchildren
are
taxable.
therefore,
the
properties
distributed
to
them
generate
taxes.
also,
out
for
the
residue,
a
very
substantial
sum
of
money
was
paid
for
death
duties.
those
death
duties,
of
course,
are
not
deductible
items
in
computing
taxes.
therefore,
the
moneys
that
we
use
for
the
payment
of
the
death
duties
also
generate
estate
taxes
and
they
are
involved
here.
the
executers,
of
course,
were
aware
of
the
problem
that
faced
them
in
this
matter
and
of
the
importance
of
it
to
the
widow
and
to
the
grandchildren
because
the
sums
involved
were
substantial.
the
executives
first
have
to
deal
with
the
problem
when
they
filed
their
federal
estate
tax
return.
and
they
computed
their
tax
obligations
there
on
the
premise
that
no
part
of
these
taxes,
which
i
have
described
were
to
be
born
by
the
widow
and
that
all
were
to
be
paid
out
of
the
grandchildren's
share.
the
internal
revenue
service
could
not
agree
with
that
treatment.
and
eventually,
they
said
that
a
deficiency
would
be
assessed
on
that
account.
now,
such
a
deficiency,
as
i
indicated
in
my
opening
sentence,
turns
entirely
upon
the
law
of
connecticut
and
upon
the
amount
of
money
that
is
distributable
under
connecticut
law
to
the
will.
it
does
not
involve
any
interpretation
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
at
the
time
that
the
executor's
and
internal
revenue
service
joined
the
issue
on
this
matter,
three
years
gone
by
since
the
testators'
death.
it
was
obvious
to
the
executor's
that
the
matter
was
going
to
have
to
be
settled
and
was
going
to
have
to
be
settled
by
a
connecticut
court.
so
at
that
time
--
excuse
me
a
moment
--
the
executor's
filed
their
first
accounting.
i
should
say
in
connecticut
that
all
the
states
have
judicial
counties.
they
filed
that
first
accounting
which
showed
the
payment
of
all
of
the
death
duties
that
had
been
assessed
at
that
time.
this
was
a
statutory
obligation
of
the
executor's.
they
also
accompanied
their
administration
account
with
a
petition
to
the
court
to
rule
on
this
matter
concerning
the
proration
of
estate
taxes.
and
accompanying
that
petition,
they
filed
a
proposed
computation
of
the
tax
following
the
same
premise
that
they
had
used
in
their
federal
estate
tax
return.
now,
the
government
seems
to
think
that
in
doing
that,
the
executor's
were
engaging
in
some
slick
trick.
it's
not
clear
from
the
government's
brief
but
the
implication
i
think
is,
that
the
executor's
should
not
have
taken
this
matter
to
the
fede
--
to
the
probate
court
but
should
have
let
it
to
the
decision
perhaps
of
some
federal
tribunal
which
one
i
don't
know.
certainly,
the
district
court
has
no
probate
jurisdiction
and
neither
does
the
tax
court.
the
executor's
and
i
wish
to
make
this
abundantly
clear,
had
no
alternative
but
to
ask
the
probate
court
to
do
this
because
it
involved
an
adjudication
of
property
rights
under
the
law
of
connecticut
and
under
the
decedent's
will.
the
executor's
would
not
have
been
able
to
charge
these
taxes
that
are
in
question
against
either
the
widow
or
against
the
grandchildren
without
having
obtained
an
order
from
the
probate
court.
and
if
you
examined
the
decree
that
was
finally
issued,
you
will
see
that
it
authorizes
the
executor's
to
make
charges
for
these
taxes
against
the
grandchildren's
share.
the
--
at
one
point
in
its
brief,
the
government
states
that
this
was
an
effort
to
avoid
estate
taxes
on
the
part
of
the
executor's,
but
that
is
not
true.
it
was
a
vital
step
necessary
to
the
settlement
of
the
state
unless
the
executors
wish
to
accept
personal
responsibility
for
whatever
decision
they
make.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
the
executor's
were
required
by
statute
to
file
a
proposed
computation
of
the
prorates.
and
they
did
file
such
a
proposed
computation
and
then
a
sense
that
is
a
petition
--
a
position.
i
don't
think
that
after
the
executor's
have
discharged
that
initial
duty,
they
have
any
responsibility
other
than
to
explain
the
matter
for
the
probate
court
because
the
interested
parties,
the
parties
who
are
either
gone
to
win
or
lose
as
a
result
of
the
property
--
of
the
determination
of
their
property
rights
are
the
ones
involved.
so
the
probate
court
schedule,
the
hearing
on
this
petition,
and
notice
was
given
to
the
widow
and
to
the
adult
grandchildren,
there
were
two
of
them,
and
to
the
guardian
ad
litem
who
represented
seven
minor
grandchildren
and
he
also
appeared
for
the
unknown
remainderman
of
the
trusts.
also
in
conformity
with
connecticut
probate
practice,
there
was
a
newspaper
publication
of
the
hearing
because
our
probate
proceedings
are
supposed
to
be
in
rem
in
character
and
notice
is
given
to
the
world.
also
notice
of
this
hearing
was
given
to
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue.obviously,
all
parties
as
well
as
the
judge
were
aware
of
the
incidental
effect
that
this
determination
of
property
rights
would
have
upon
the
calculation
of
the
estate
tax.
notice
was
given
to
the
district
director
and
he
was
provided
with
the
copy,
the
copies
of
the
executor's
petition
and
the
computation
was
stay
at
filed.
the
hearing
was
held
on
november
27,
1961.
the
executives
appeared
by
counsel
and
submitted
the
brief
justifying
or
explaining
the
position
which
they
had
taken.
the
widow
did
not
appear
and
neither
did
the
adult
grandchildren
and
neither
do
the
district
director
of
internal
revenues.
the
guardian
ad
litem
did
appear.
this
was
on
november
27th.
after
the
hearing,
time
was
allowed
to
guardian
for
filing
a
report.
and
he
did
file
a
report
dated
december
22nd
in
which
--
which
is
in
the
record.
and
in
which
he
said
that
he
had
considered
this
matter,
and
despite
the
adverse
financial
affect
upon
the
--
his
words
rights,
he
thought
that
the
computation
that
had
been
made
by
the
executor's
was
the
proper
one
to
make
under
connecticut
law.
the
report
that
he
filed
--
he
filed
a
formal
report
and
he
also
filed
a
letter.
he
submitted
a
letter
to
the
judge
explaining
his
position.
and
soon
after
that,
if
not
immediately,
the
judge
of
probate
passed
his
order
and
issued
a
short
memorandum
from
which
it
appears
that
he
clearly
understood
all
of
the
issues
that
were
involved,
he
understood
the
importance
of
the
property
rights
that
were
at
stake
and
he
understood
too
the
effect
that
this
would
have
upon
federal
taxes.
and
he
cited
in
his
memorandum
the
leading
connecticut
authorities
on
the
question
and
said
that
the
computation
as
submitted
by
the
executors
was
correct,
and
he
ordered
that
the
bequest
of
the
grandchildren
be
charged
with
these
taxes
and
were
attributable
to
the
residuary
properties.
now,
the
law
of
connecticut
on
this
matter
is
rather
simple.
and
i
think
the
law
of
connecticut
agrees
with
the
law
in
most
of
the
states
where
they
have
apportionment
statutes
at
least
it's
identical
with
the
law
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
that
is
the
--
the
law
is
this
that
the
apportionment
statute
was
enacted
to
achieve
equitable
and
remedial
ends.
that's
a
fair
thing
because
it
places
upon
each
legacy
the
portion
of
the
estate
taxes
that
where
legacy
generates.
therefore,
the
court
says
that
while
the
testator
may
direct
against
apportionment,
if
he
wants
to
make
a
direction,
his
words
must
be
so
clear
that
all
doubt
as
to
the
extent
and
limitation
of
his
command
must
be
completely
dispelled.
i
have
quoted
pretty
exactly,
i
think
some
language
from
one
of
the
connecticut
decisions,
the
common
way
of
expressing
the
same
concept
is
that
the
language
of
the
exe
--
of
the
testator
must
be
clear
and
unambiguous.
in
the
first
case
that
came
up
in
connecticut,
there
was
a
direction
on
the
will,
pay
all
taxes
out
of
the
residue.
in
that
case,
it
happened
that
the
testator
had
constructed
some
inter
vivos
trusts
and
a
question
arose
as
to
whether
or
not
the
residuary
estate
should
pay
the
tax
on
the
inter
vivos
trusts.
and
the
court
said,
"no!
he
hadn't
been
specific
about
this."
he
said
all
taxes
be
paid
out
of
the
residue
but
he
didn't
say
that
the
taxes
on
the
inter
vivos
trust
should
be
taken.
then
there
is
the
leading
case
in
connecticut
new
york
trust
versus
doubleday,
where
again
the
testator
said,
"pay
all
of
the
debt
taxes
out
of
the
residue."
and
the
same
question
that
arose
there
arose
here.
it
was
a
gift
to
the
widow
that
qualified
for
a
tax
exemption
in
the
residue.
and
the
court
said
that
the
direction
to
pay
all
taxes
out
of
the
residue
was
not
a
direction
against
proration
within
the
--
or
between
the
residuary
gifts.
and
in
the
doubleday
case,
the
widow's
gift
was
born
no
part
of
these
estate
taxes.
now,
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
the
will
of
the
testator
when
it
was
made
or
when
he
made
that
will,
the
problem
of
proration
between
the
residuary
gifts
was
not
at
issue
or
in
his
mind
at
all.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
that
was
--
that
was
in
his
will.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
yes.
and
it
was
not
changed
by
the
codicil.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
well,
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
or
as
i
understand
it
has
really
been
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
where
there
was
a
case
that
is
very
similar
to
this
that
arose
in
connection
with
mr.
schubert's
will.
he
had
a
tax
clause
that
directed
payment
out
of
the
residue.
and
the
residue
of
his
estate,
there
were
four
trusts.
he
made
a
codicil.
and
as
a
result
of
a
codicil,
one
more
of
those
trusts
became
charitable
in
nature
and
therefore
tax
exempt.
and
the
question
was
what
effect
did
his
tax
clause
have
after
the
codicil
was
executed
and
these
trusts
became
tax
exempted?
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
said
that
that
tax
clause
could
not
be
read
to
direct
the
accomplishment
of
an
object
that
was
totally
unnecessary
when
it
was
written.
in
other
words,
the
schubert
wills,
there
was
no
occasion
for
proration
between
the
residuary
gifts
when
the
will
became
exe
--
was
executed.
that
became
important
only
after
the
codicil.
the
schubert
decree
--
schubert
judgment,
opinion
had
not
been
decided
when
the
probate
judge
acted
on
this
matter.
but
it
was
decided
by
the
time
that
the
--
that
this
case
reached
the
district
court.
and
of
course,
it's
one
of
the
authorities
which
that
court
relied
upon
because
of
its
close
similarity
to
this
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
case
went
there,
they
didn't
recognize
and
i
submit
this
with
all
due
respect.
they
didn't
recognize
the
connecticut
law
which
said
that
as
soon
as
you
have
a
doubt
as
to
what
the
testator's
intention
were
with
respect
to
this
matter,
you
do
not
resolve
the
doubt
by
the
process
of
construction.
rather
you
let
the
apportionment
statute
operate
because
that
achieves
an
equitable
end.
so
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
and
my
brothers
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
attempt
to
circumvent
the
connecticut
law
by
the
process
of
construction.
they
do
so
admittedly.
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
its
own
opinion
as
one
construing
the
will.
and
they
did
it
in
such
fashion
as
this.
the
testator
when
he
executed
the
codicil
had
ample
opportunity
to
provide
for
a
special
tax
treatment
for
his
widow
if
he
chose
to
do
so.
i
don't
know
on
what
facts
that
statement
is
founded,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
it,
but
the
important
points
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
is
that
it's
not
special
tax
treatment
for
the
will.
it's
the
ordinary
tax
treatment.
it's
the
tax
treatment
which
the
legislature
of
connecticut
said
she
was
entitled
to
have
unless
there's
this
specific
direction
to
the
contrary.
the
court
of
appeals
also
said,
"we
don't
think
that
the
testator
wanted
such
gross
disproportion
between
his
widow's
one-third
share
and
the
children's."
and
of
course,
it
doesn't
work
out
on
a
one-third
and
two-thirds
basis
if
the
children
pay
all
the
taxes.
but
they
don't
recognize
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
and
actually,
the
converse
is
that
the
widow
would
pay
one-third
of
all
the
taxes
that
were
generated
by
the
gifts
to
the
children.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
in
conflict
with
the
established
law
of
connecticut,
the
law
as
established
by
our
own
supreme
court
and
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
for
that
account.
in
our
reply
brief,
i
mentioned
collaterally
that
we
have
a
situation
here
where
we
had
a
guardian
ad
litem
and
we
have
a
probate
judge
and
we
have
a
district
judge,
all
highly
experienced
and
capable
connecticut
lawyers.
and
they
all
saw
eye-to-eye
on
this
proposition
which
strikes
me
as
being
something
pertinent.
i
notice
my
white
light
is
signaled.
the
government
here
has
changed
its
base
a
little
bit
so
far
as
the
second
question
is
concerned
and
the
government
itself
is
now
asking
that
the
decision
of
the
court
--
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
sent
back
for
determination
as
to
whether
this
was
an
adversary
or
nonadversary
proceeding.
i've
explained
our
position
on
that
in
our
brief.
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
the
probate
court
or
the
decision
of
any
state
court
should
be
respected
by
the
internal
revenue
service
if
it
is
an
honest
exercise
of
the
judicial
function.
if
it's
something
less
than
that,
then
it's
not
a
good
determination
of
property
rights.
but
so
long
as
it
determines
those
property
rights
knowingly
and
with
an
awareness
of
all
the
issues,
and
all
the
cases
that
decision
so
stand.
the
government
says,
"we
produce
some
cases
in
our
footnotes
here
which
were
never
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
probate
judge."
if
those
cases
were
of
any
importance,
we
might
expect
to
find
them
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals.
but
out
of
11
cases
cited
by
the
government,
only
one
appears
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
decisions
which
the
government
is
referring
to
recite
the
usual
tenants
of
construction
about
the
intent
of
the
testator
and
so
forth
and
i
say
seriously
that
despite
the
three
briefs
that
had
been
written
on
this
subject,
the
government
--
government's
counsel
with
all
their
ability
have
been
unable
to
cite
one
single
case
which
militates
against
the
decision
of
the
probate
court
and
of
the
federal
district
court.
i
may
have
save
a
minute
or
two
for
reply.
i
hope
so.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
may
i
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question?
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
the
effect
of
the
probate
decree,
the
probate
court
adjudicated
the
property
rights
of
the
widow
and
the
grandchildren,
and
the
remainderman
of
the
cost.
and
that
decree
is
binding
and
the
probate
court
cannot
modify
it
nor
so
far
as
i
can
see
can
any
court
in
the
land.
that's
a
final
decision.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
well,
the
grandchildren
will
get
less.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
the
government
has
received
the
million
dollars.
in
effect,
it
has
taken
that
away
--
in
effect,
it
wants
to
take
it
away
from
that
widow.
under
the
probate
decree,
it
will
be
charged
against
the
grandchildren.
now
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
unless
the
decree
is
reversed.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
the
petition
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
i
think
it's
been
made
largely,
your
honor.
we
don't
--
in
our
probate
--
probate
practice
doesn't
require
under
these
circumstances
at
least
an
order
of
distribution.
the
will
itself
authorizes
the
executors
to
make
the
distribution.
and
i'm
sure
that
by
this
time,
the
grandchildren's
trusts
have
been
established
to
the
extent
that
they
can
be.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
not
entirely,
no.
no
because
we're
seeking
--
we're
seeking
this
refund.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
but
we
have
--
we
pay
all
of
the
taxes
that
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
--
around
the
horizon.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
and
we
had
paid
all
of
the
taxes
at
the
time
that
the
probate
decree
was
entered
with
the
exception
of
this
deficiency.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
this
is
a
suit
for
a
refund.
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
a
refund
--
mr.
curtiss
k.
thompson
the
probate
decree
has
said
charge
these
taxes
against
the
grandchildren.
and
the
--
the
--
the
liability
of
the
parties
for
the
--
for
the
taxes
has
already
been
determined
and
has
been
performed
than
discharge
so
that
it
goes
back
into
the
estate.
and
it
should
be
divided
between
all
the
legatees.
thank
you.
