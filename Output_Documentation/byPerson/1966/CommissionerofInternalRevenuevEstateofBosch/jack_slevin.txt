mr.
jack
s.levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
and
by
the
succeeding
companion
case
is
whether
an
erroneous
state
probate
court
decree
or
it's
a
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
that
of
course
is
--
is
what
my
brother
here
has
argued
here
at
some
length.
i
think
that
we
would
not
have
brought
the
next
case
to
this
court
or
acquiesced
in
this
case
if
we
thought
that
we
are
presenting
to
this
court
solely
a
question
or
primarily
a
question
of
connecticut
law,
or
as
in
the
next
case
of
new
york
law.
in
order
for
us
to
present
the
question
which
we
seek
here
to
present,
we
must
first
either
assume
or
convince
you
that
the
decision
of
the
connecticut
probate
court
is
wrong.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
as
a
matter
of
connecticut
law.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
in
deciding
--
in
deciding
what
connecticut
law
is
certainly
a
decision
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court
or
of
the
connecticut
appellate
courts
intermediate
appellate
courts
would
be
very
relevant.
this
case
was
not
appealed.
mr.
jack
s.levin
if
this
case
went
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
it
would
certainly
be
binding.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes,
for
the
purposes
of
this
tax
case
and
i
should
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
determining
connecticut
law
in
any
case
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
would
accept
it
as
binding
if
it
had
been
adversary
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
jack
s.levin
even
though
in
our
view
erroneous.
we
think
that's
further
than
the
government
has
to
go
but
we
think
that
that's
fair
and
reaches
a
just
to
accommodation
between
the
interest
of
the
state
and
federal
courts.
mr.
jack
s.levin
let
me
state
my
position
at
a
slightly
greater
length
because
it's
--
it's
not
that
easy
to
state.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
at
least
three
possible
views
that
can
be
taken.
the
one
view
which
is
taken
by
the
petitioner
here
is
that
a
state
probate
or
trial
court
decision
is
always
binding
on
the
federal
government
regardless
of
whether
it's
erroneous,
regardless
of
whether
its
adversary,
it's
always
binding.
mr.
jack
s.levin
but
they're
not
binding
on
the
party
as
i've
said.
well
without
exploring
the
very
--
the
exact
ramifications
at
what
point,
what
collusive
means,
and
at
what
point
fraud
becomes
into
play,
in
general,
that's
his
position.
i
don't
mean
to
overstate
his
position.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
the
other
frueler
view
and
one
which
we
present
in
our
brief
is
that
the
state
court,
trial
court
decision
is
never
binding,
that
the
federal
government
looks
to
the
law
of
the
state.
there
is
then
an
intermediate
view
that
the
state
court
decision
should
be
accepted
so
long
as
it
was
an
adversary
decision
and
a
genuine
determination
after
all
the
parties
appeared
before.
there
were
conflicting
interests.
a
genuine
controversy
presented
to
the
court.
both
sides
of
the
issue
argued
and
the
court
made
an
actual
determination
having
been
fully
informed
of
the
issues,
the
precedents,
and
having
a
--
received
the
full
judicial
treatment
what
courts
are
all
about.
that
we
would
--
we
present
in
our
brief
those
three
positions.
we
say
that
we
are
not
abandoning
here
position
which
we
have
stated
for
the
other
--
for
the
lower
courts
that
the
decision
of
a
state
trial
court
when
it's
wrong
is
never
binding.
we're
not
abandoning
that.
but
after
an
examination
of
the
question,
the
government
feels
that
the
more
just
position,
the
more
rational
position,
the
way
to
your
position,
both
with
respect
to
congressional
intent,
the
legislative
history,
the
decided
cases,
the
regulations
and
all
other
indications
is
that
a
state
decision
which
is
a
genuine
adversary
litigation
should
be
adopted
by
the
commissioner
and
followed.
mr.
jack
s.levin
in
the
lower
court,
we
--
we
presented
both
positions.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
took
the
--
tended
toward
the
erie
position
though
not
adopting
the
full
scope.
they
pointed
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
the
rule
for
other
cases
being
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
because
in
the
ordinary
diversity
case,
the
very
parties
before
you
have
not
litigated
the
issue.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
in
an
ordinary
diversity
case,
if
a
and
b
are
litigating
an
issue,
the
federal
court
looks
to
state
decisions
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
between
x
and
y
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
to
determine
what
the
law
is.
but
if
a
and
b
have
already
had
their
rights
parceled
out
in
a
judicial
determination
in
which
they
pointed
out,
the
federal
court
will
normally
(voice
overlap)
by
that.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
think
that
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
the
erie
doctrine
applies
there
or
not.
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
both
sides
of
that
issue.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
clear
that
the
erie
doctrine
applies
there.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
present
the
issue
in
the
context
of
a
federal
tax
case.
this
case
was
simplified
facts
to
show
why
we
think
it's
unfair
to
the
commissioner
to
bind
him
by
a
nonadversary
decision
obtained
by
the
parties
who
all
took
one
side
of
an
issue,
and
yet
perhaps
unfair
to
the
parties
to
say
that
the
commissioner
will
ignore
an
adversary
determination.
but
it's
something
that
i
can
illustrate,
i
think
better
by
using
this
chart
in
a
simplified
version
of
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
now,
as
i
say,
this
is
a
simplified
version
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
estate
here
is
not
12
million
but
somewhere
around
13.
but
to
make
the
figures
work
out,
i
have
used
the
figure
12
million
for
the
estate
in
this
case.
the
question
is
how
much
is
the
widow
entitled
to
receive
net
under
the
terms
of
this
will
and
without
any
relinquishment
of
their
rights
by
the
other
beneficiaries.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
marital
deduction
gives
a
deduction
to
the
estate
for
the
amount
which
the
widow
was
entitled
to
receive
under
the
will,
and
that
any
action
after
the
date
of
death
by
the
other
beneficiaries
to
relinquish
their
rights
and
to
transfer
more
property
to
the
widow,
then
she
would
have
been
entitled
to
receive,
had
everyone
adhered
to
and
demanded
their
full
rights
that
that
cannot
increase
the
marital
deduction.
in
other
words,
if
the
widow
is
entitled
to
receive
$2
million
and
the
grandchildren
were
entitled
to
receive
$4
million
under
the
will
as
the
commissioner
contends,
and
if
the
children
had
said,
"no,
we
renounced
our
rights
as
to
two
extra
million
dollars
so
that
they'll
pass
to
the
widow
and
she'll
get
four
and
we'll
get
two,"
it's
quite
clear.
now,
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
about
this
point.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
widow
would
still
only
get
that
the
estate
would
still
only
get
a
marital
deduction
for
$2
million.
you
cannot
increase
the
marital
deduction
by
this
activity.
now,
under
the
position
taken
by
the
commissioner
which
is
that
the
will
clearly
unequivocally
provide
that
the
connecticut
proration
statute
will
not
apply,
this
would
be
the
situation.
and
if
you
will
let
me
for
a
moment,
i
will
assume
that
the
commissioner
is
correct.
and
then
later
on,
i
will
argue
as
i
did
in
the
brief
what
connecticut
law
provides.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
--
that
the
question
have
general
importance
here.
i
will
get
to
it.
if
the
commissioner
is
correct,
you
got
in
estate
of
$12
million.
you
got
in
estate
tax
payable
of
$6
million.
now,
i
worked
that
out
in
advanced
because
the
estate
tax
depends
on
the
amounts
the
widow
will
get.
and
the
amounts
the
widow
will
get
depend
on
the
estate
tax.
there's
a
simple
formula
for
working
it
out,
it's
done
all
the
time.
i've
done
it
in
advance.
the
estate
tax
will
be
$6
million.
the
remainder
of
$6
million
will
go
as
the
will
provides
one-third
to
the
widow
or
$2
million
and
two-thirds
to
the
grandchildren
or
$4
million.
the
commissioner
then
says,
"you're
entitled
to
a
deduction
of
$2
million
for
the
marital
deduction.
and
your
estate
tax
is
therefore
$6
million."
the
petitioner
goes
into
the
probate
court.
now,
i
want
to
make
this
for
this
is
after
the
commissioner
has
taken
his
position,
issued
a
30-day
notice
of
deficiency
which
is
a
formal
letter
stating
his
position.
after
that
has
happened,
the
commissioner
has
made
his
position
clear.
petitioner
then
goes
into
probate
court
and
he
files,
the
executor
files
a
document
there,
requesting
that
the
probate
court
hold
that
the
will
does
not
unequivocally
negates
the
proration
statute,
and
that
the
court
therefore
holds
that
the
estate
be
distributed
differently.
he
says,
therefore,
the
widow
should
get
one-third
of
the
estate
before
any
taxes
are
paid.
that
is
$4
million.
once
you
determine
that
the
widow
gets
$4
million
that
would
make
the
estate
tax
$5
million.
and
the
remainder
that's
left
over
or
$3
million
would
go
to
the
grandchildren.
now,
here's
the
will
that
says
one-third
to
the
widow,
two-thirds
to
the
grandchildren.
and
under
their
interpretation,
the
widow
who
is
getting
one-third
would
end
up
with
more
than
the
grandchildren
who
were
suppose
to
get
two-thirds.
that's
a
question
of
connecticut
law.
i
think
we're
quite
clearly
correct,
the
second
circuit
agreed
but
i'm
trying
to
illustrate
a
broader
principle
here.
now,
what
happens
as
we
see
it,
when
you
have
this
nonadversary
proceeding
in
the
probate
court
where
all
the
parties
come
in
and
say,
"we
agree
your
honor."
all
the
parties
come
in
at
filed
briefs.
their
grandchildren
--
even
though
the
grandchildren
didn't
bother
to
appear
the
guardian
ad
litem
policy,
everybody
said
to
the
probate
judge,
"we
have
no
objection".
we
agree
the
pro
--
the
estate
should
be
divided
up
like
this.
what
really
happens
is
as
follows.
what
really
happens
is
that
the
grandchildren
have
relinquished
a
portion
of
their
rights
to
the
extent
of
$1
million
to
the
widow.
so
that
they're
not
getting
$4
million
anymore,
they're
getting
$3
million.
they've
transferred
a
million
to
the
widow.
and
the
effect
of
their
transferring
$1
million
to
the
widow
is
to
give
any
greater
marital
deduction.
and
by
that
effect,
to
force
the
commissioner
or
the
united
states
to
give
up
an
additional
$1
million
so
that
what
happens
is
that
by
the
grandchildren
consenting
to
relinquish
their
rights
to
the
extent
of
$1
million
to
the
widow,
decreasing
their
--
decreasing
their
bequest
from
$4
million
to
$3
million,
increasing
her
bequest
from
$2
to
$3,
they
forced
the
commissioner
if
that's
adopted,
to
reduce
the
estate
tax
from
$6
to
$5
and
saving
to
the
family
is
an
additional
million
dollars.
so
by
transferring,
by
an
intrafamily
transfer
agreed
upon,
nobody
disputing
it,
everybody
coming
in
and
presenting
a
uniform
position
to
the
probate
court
by
the
briefs
which
don't
cite
the
cases
that
go
the
other
way.
don't
make
the
argument
which
we
make.
by
this
intrafamily
transfer
of
a
million
dollars
which
they
disguised
by
having
the
probate
court,
approve
it,
they
in
effect
cut
the
estate
tax
by
$1
million.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
purpose
is
to
illustrate
hopefully
--
hopefully
without
getting
into
too
many
numbers,
the
fact
that
what
we
have
in
most
of
these
cases,
and
they
arise
quite
frequently,
the
purpose
is
that
when
you
have
this
probate
court
decreased,
you
have
intrafamily
shifts
of
property.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
here's
--
if
you
would
have
to
argue
the
correct
as
the
probate
court
decree
first,
that's
a
question
of
connecticut
law.
i
would
like
to
deal
with
it
very
quickly.
i
think
it's
an
easy
issue.
you
got
a
will
which
is
as
clear
as
any
will
i've
ever
seen
in
negating
the
proration
statute,
provides
that
i
direct
the
executors
to
pay
my
taxes
out
of
the
residue
of
the
estate
and
the
provisions
of
any
statute
requiring
the
apportionment
or
proration
of
such
taxes
among
the
beneficiaries
of
this
will,
shall
be
without
effect
in
the
settlement
of
--
of
my
debts.
it's
clearly
as
you
can
make
it,
he
has
provided
that
the
proration
statute
shall
not
be
applicable
in
his
codicil,
he
provides
that
in
all
other
respects,
"i
hereby
republish
and
confirm
my
will."
he
has
indicated
no
intention
to
change
the
--
the
proration
statute
negation
which
he
put
in
this
original
will.
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
--
in
our
brief
which
indicate
that
that's
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
jack
s.levin
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
let
me
try
to
answer
why.
i
--
the
government
will
be
satisfied
if
the
court
adopts
the
so-called
erie-freuler
position.
that
is
the
easiest
position
for
us
to
take
in
the
lower
courts
and
we'll
be
perfectly
happy
to
have
that
position
as
we
state
in
our
briefs.
but
in
fairness
to
the
court,
we
wish
to
point
out
to
try
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
white's
question,
we
think
we
should
point
out
the
effect
that
this
would
have.
assume
for
just
a
moment
that
the
grandchildren
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
alright.
mr.
jack
s.levin
assume
for
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
alright.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no.
i
don't
say
bona
fide
proceeding.
i
don't
know
what
bona
fide
means.
i'm
talking
about
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
here's
what
i
mean
by
that.
assume
that
the
grandchildren
here
and
the
widow
were
at
odds
with
each
other.
perhaps
they
were
the
grandchildren
by
another
marriage.
she
was
a
later
wife
and
they
were
at
odds
with
each
other.
that
the
grandchildren
went
into
the
probate
court
and
said,
"no,
no
we
are
entitled
to
the
four
$4
million,
not
the
$3
million."
and
the
widow
took
the
--
took
the
position
that
she
was
entitled
to
the
$4
million.
and
they
actually
tried
and
litigated
the
case.
and
at
the
end
of
the
litigation,
the
probate
court
reached
a
decision
which
was
wrong.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
district
director
was
given
notice
that
a
proceeding
would
be
held.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that
decision
was
made
over
20
years
ago.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
he
would
--
they
did
not
purport
to
join
him
as
a
party
and
of
course,
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
sue
him.
mr.
jack
s.levin
they
gave
him
a
piece
of
paper
which
told
him
that
the
hearing
would
be
held.
that's
correct.
now,
that
the
question
that
you
raised
is,
why
shouldn't
i
take
it?
why
shouldn't
the
district
director's
people
or
the
government's
counsel
appear
in
these
probate
courts?
and
if
they
want
to
litigate
the
question,
litigate
it
in
the
probate
court.
well
it
is
our
position
that
that's
a
judgment
for
congress
to
make
and
that
congress
has
made
the
judgment.
but
here's
why.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
the
government's
position
was
the
same.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
government's
position
was
the
same
and
it
was
formulated.
the
reason
that
the
government
has
taken
this
position
is
because
an
assessment
was
made
over
20
years
ago
as
to
whether
the
government,
united
states
should
attempt
to
participate
in
the
many,
many
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
probate
proceedings,
declaratory
judgment
proceedings.
as
you'll
see
in
the
next
case,
it
was
not
a
probate
proceeding
in
bosch.
it
was
sort
of
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
in
the
new
york
supreme
court,
the
trial
court
there
whether
the
government
should
go
around
the
country
appearing
in
the
various
local
courts
especially
probate
courts.
and
an
assessment
made
of
the
manpower
available,
the
familiarity
of
the
government
with
the
procedures
in
these
various
courts.
you
have
now
50
states.
at
that
time
you
had
48
states.
you've
got
a
limited
amount
of
manpower.
you've
got
the
situation
where
the
government
doesn't
always
know
just
what's
at
stake.
if
that
rule
were
that
the
government
had
to
participate
in
all
these
proceedings,
i
suppose
it
would
be
very
simple
to
amend
all
the
forms
so
that
in
addition
to
giving
50
or
100
relatives
notice
of
every
type
of
hearing
that
went
on
in
every
probate
court
in
the
country,
you
merely
added
the
district
director's
name.
and
the
united
states
would
get
notice
of
all
these
proceedings.
the
united
states
wouldn't
come
near
having
the
manpower
under
the
existing
appropriations,
i
don't
believe,
to
appear
in
these
proceedings,
to
take
a
meaningful
part,
to
ascertain
in
the
flood
of
mail
that
would
come
in
carrying
notices
of
proceedings
of
all
kinds.
which
proceedings
were
meaningful?
which
ones
it
should
participate
in?
for
that
reason,
the
commissioner
published,
put
out
a
release
in
1947.
and
if
i
have
time,
i'll
give
the
history
up
to
1947
but
1947,
he
put
out
a
release,
in
which
he
said,
and
judge
friendly
discusses
this
in
a
footnote
in
his
dissent
in
--
in
bosch.
in
which
the
commissioners
said
that,
"we
will
not
go
into
these
probate
court
proceedings."
we
will
not
attempt
to
answer
notices
and
go
in.
this
is
well
known.
everyone
knows
it.
i
believe
that
congress
knows
it.
i
think
the
legislative
history,
as
i'll
get
to
in
just
a
moment
of
the
marital
deduction
provision
which
was
passed
subsequently
for
the
first
time,
tends
to
indicate
that
congress
knew
that
the
commissioner
was
not
going
to
go
in
and
create
an
adversary
proceeding
out
of
these
proceedings
which
were
really
intrafamily
proceedings
in
probate
courts.
now,
if
congress
wants
to
change
it
to
appropriate
additional
funds,
to
make
available
of
the
additional
lawyers
that
throughout
the
union
in
the
50
states
so
that
the
government
can
appear,
i
think
that's
a
decision
for
congress
to
make.
the
government,
the
executive
branch,
doesn't
feel
that
it
can
do
it
in
the
absence
of
this
direction.
and
that's
why
we
didn't
appear
in
this
probate
court
proceeding.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
the
government
has
never
appeared
in
a
probate
court
proceeding.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
the
third
circuit
has
adopted,
it's
the
only
circuit
which
has
unequivocally
adopted
the
contrary
rule,
the
rule
that
tax
bearer
here
seeks.
in
the
third
circuit
where
for
the
last
11
years,
we
have
been
found
by
these
nonadversary
probate
court
proceedings,
the
government
has
on
a
few
occasions
knowing
that
it
was
going
to
be
bound
in
the
absence
of
a
later
decision
by
this
court,
appeared
in
the
probate
court.
but
that's
one
state
in
a
few
proceedings.
this
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
i
--
the
only
area
that
i
was
able
to
come
up
with
as
discussed
in
our
fairly
lengthy
footnote,
the
social
security
area.
sometimes
you
get
in
the
question
of
whether
state
probate
or
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
somebody
was
the
widow
or
wife
of
someone
else
is
relevant
for
social
security.
and
there,
the
lower
courts
have
split
on
what
relevance
this
has.
they've
gone
into
the
legislative
history
and
looked
to
see
what
congress
intended
and
there
are
some
decisions
each
way(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
s.levin
it
--
in
many
respects,
divorce
law
of
course
is
different
because
divorce
is
a
status
which
--
which
one
can
wonder
whether
the
judiciary
should
get
into
in
the
legislative
branch,
and
the
executive
of
course
have
made
these
decisions
in
many
states,
every
state
that
they
should
get
into
it.
but
i
think
that
marriage
is
in
many
respects
different.
but
even
in
the
marriage
area,
this
court
and
the
state
courts
have
recognized
that
a
nonadversary
proceeding
between
husband
and
wife
does
not
always
bind
other
people
issue
as
to
rights
of
inheritance
as
to
custody,
as
to
alimony
as
to
--
as
to
other
items.
i'm
not
saying
that
marriage
is
necessary
an
analogy
here.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
you
have
a
nonadversary
proceeding
in
a
state
probate
court
which
makes
intrafamily
shifts
of
property
that
that
shouldn't
bind
the
commissioner.
that
shouldn't
bind
the
commissioner
anymore
perhaps
than
the
marriage
situation
binds
third
parties.
but
here
i
think
we've
got
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
don't
ask
them
to
fight.
certainly
we
don't
ask
them
to
fight.
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
just
say
that
if
they
don't
want
--
if
they
don't
determine
it
among
themselves.
and
if
they
just
come
in
and
everyone
takes
the
position,
yes,
give
the
widow
$4
million.
everyone
takes
that
position.
they
shouldn't
bind
the
commissioner.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i'd
be
happy
to
go
further
and
say
that
the
commissioner
should
never
accept
it.
we
present
that
position
in
our
brief.
we
asked
that
court
--
we
ask
this
court
to
take
the
position
that
a
probate
court
decree
is
never
binding
or
a
lower
court
decree
is
never
binding.
the
government
will
succeed,
will
win
these
cases.
in
fact,
it
would
be
a
much
easier
rule
for
us
to
--
to
apply
if
you
took
the
complete
freuler
position.
the
government
is
never
bound
by
a
trial
or
probate
court
decree.
and
i'd
be
happy
to
argue
for
that
here.
i
do
at
some
length
in
the
brief.
it's
just
that
it
seems
that
in
many
cases
in
the
few
cases,
not
in
many,
in
the
few
cases
where
there
has
been
a
genuine
litigation,
a
genuine
argument
between
the
parties.
and
one
side
has
lost
after
making
a
full
presentation
to
the
court
that
it
seems
more
in
accord
with
our
adversary
system
for
the
commissioner
to
accept
that.
his
regulations
which
have
been
extends
since
1919
in
one
area,
and
since
1949
in
the
marital
deduction
area
seemed
to
accept
a
--
an
adversary
genuinely
litigated
decision
right
or
wrong.
they
go
--
they
indicate
that
if
it's
not
a
genuinely
litigated
decision,
they
will
not
accept
it.
but
congress
has
reenacted
the
code
many
times
since
1919.
the
vast
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
that
view.
now,
legislative
history
is
a
marital
deduction
provision
which
was
enacted
in
1948
indicates
that
congress
too
was
adopting
this
view.
but
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
have
this
court
come
out
with
the
so-called
erie
position
that
the
government
is
never
bound
by
a
state
trial
court.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
that's
not
an
easy
question
to
resolve.
so
far
as
i
know
this
--
this
estate
has
not
yet
been
distributed.
the
money
insofar
as
i
know
is
still
on
the
hands
of
the
probate
court.
the
typical
thing
in
these
cases,
in
probate
cases
is
to
hold
the
money
until
the
estate
taxes
are
all
parceled
out.
but
whether
the
connecticut
probate
court
could
now
reverse
itself
and
go
back
the
other
way
is
something
that
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
connecticut
law
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
is
not
clear
on
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
precluded
from
what?
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
certainly
the
grandchildren
if
they
all
agreed
to
do
so
could
reverse
themselves
the
decision
originally
made.
what
you
are
asking
is
having
in
effect
may
the
gift
of
a
million
dollar
is
over
here,
can
they
now
say,
"well
if
the
federal
government
won't
recognized
if
we
can
take
it
back."
mr.
jack
s.levin
second
circuit
of
course
came
out
the
other
way
very
clearly.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
could
give
the
money
back,
i
suppose.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
grandchildren,
to
give
the
money
back
if
they
have
control.
mr.
jack
s.levin
excuse
me,
your
honor.
the
widow
could
give
the
money
back.
you're
saying
if
the
widow
doesn't
consent,
that
the
widow
says,
"oh
no,
i've
got
--
i've
got
the
extra
million.
it's
a
come
to
me."
probate
court
won't
reverse
itself
and
i
won't
reverse
myself.
the
answer
is
no,
i
don't
see
that
there's
anything
that
they
can
do.
but
the
grandchildren
are
not
paying
any
tax.
it's
not
as
if
we're
taxing
the
grandchildren
a
million
dollars
they
didn't
get
--
they
don't
pay
a
tax.
the
tax
is
paid
by
the
estate.
the
question
is
in
computing
the
estate
tax
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
how
do
you
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
it
would
also
make
a
big
difference
if
the
grandchildren
being
ignorant
of
federal
estate
tax
law
had
come
in
and
filed
a
renunciation
said,
"we
renounced
to
the
extent
of
$1
million."
probate
courts
says
that
i
accept
your
renunciation
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
then
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
that
may
be
very
true
if
the
probate
court
will
not
reverse
itself.
that
may
be
very
--
maybe
the
effect
of
renouncing
your
rights,
of
giving
up
your
rights
in
a
judicial
proceeding
of
consenting.
you
may
then
be
bound
and
you
may
not
be
able
to
withdraw
your
renunciation
at
a
later
time.
i
don't
think
that's
unusual.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
the
record
clearly
shows
that
no
one
presented
any
other
view.everyone
came
in
at
filed
briefs,
saying
that
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
i
don't
think
that's
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
if
this
court
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
reason
we
ask
for
a
remand
is
because
the
decision
was
originally
made
on
summary
judgment.
there
has
never
been
a
trial
of
this
issue
of
adversary
in
this
or
not.
in
other
words,
the
petitioner
came
in
and
said
to
the
court,
"we
don't
think
whether
it's
an
adversary
decision
or
not
matters."
we
ask
you
to
hold
that
the
federal
courts
are
bound
by
this
decree,
adversary
or
not.
they
took
the
legal
position
that
it
wasn't
relevant.
the
district
court
disagreed
with
them
but
agreed
with
them
on
connecticut
law.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
as
a
matter
of
connecticut
law,
but
also
agreed
that
it
wasn't
relevant
whether
there
was
an
adversary
proceeding
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
has
taken
the
position
that
you're
never
bound
by
a
state
court
decree
adversary
or
not.
mr.
jack
s.levin
if
this
court
binds
that
whether
the
proceeding
was
adversary
in
the
connecticut
state
probate
court
is
a
relevant
fact,
then
i
think
the
court
has
to
remand
for
determination
of
that
fact.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
evidence
in
the
record
now
so
far,
there's
a
very
strong
and
that
this
was
a
nonadversary
proceeding.
but
it
would
certainly
be
unfair
if
i
were
to
preclude
the
petitioner
from
presenting
any
additional
evidence
it
might
have.
mr.
jack
s.levin
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
belligerency
what
we're
--
with
adversary
proceeding
as
we
explain
it
in
our
brief
means
that
two
sides
come
in.
each
say,
"we
believe
that
we're
entitled
to
win."
they
file
a
brief
setting
forth
the
arguments
in
their
favor.
and
they
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
they
wish
to
win.
here,
this
was
just
the
opposite.
everyone
came
in
and
says
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
that's
correct.
there
can't
be
an
adversary
proceeding
if
everyone
comes
into
a
court
and
says,
the
winner
says,
"i
think
i
should
win"
and
the
loser
comes
in
and
says,
"i
think
i
should
lose."
they
don't
cite
the
relevant
decisions
to
the
court.
they
don't
inform
the
court.
and
the
court
says,
"well,
i
supposed
--
the
whole
-the
whole
gist
of
our
system
of
courts
is
for
the
courts
to
reserve
their
energies
for
the
disputed
cases
where
they
actually
have
to
decide
an
existing
controversy."
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
i
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
that
in
many
of
those
cases,
you
don't
have
everyone
appearing
and
taking
the
same
position.
you
may
just
have
the
trustee
coming
in
and
saying,
"can
i
have
permission
to
do
a
certain
thing?"
the
court
grants
the
permission,
makes
a
cursory
inspection.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
of
course,
as
it's
a
renunciation,
and
outright
disclaimer
that
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
it's
already
been
paid.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
think
that's
up
to
the
probate
court
to
decide,
i
suppose.
mr.
jack
s.levin
it's
a
connecticut
law
question.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
that's
a
question
of
connecticut
law.
i
can't
answer
that
simply.
i
tried
to
research
that
as
to
whether
how
revisable
connecticut
decrees
are,
what
the
practice
of
the
probate
court
was.
there
aren't
a
lot
of
precedents
on
that
because
as
mr.
justice
fortas
points
out,
there
aren't
a
lot
of
contested
probate
court
decisions.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
probate
court
has
not
entered
a
final
order
of
distribution
yet.
the
only
order
it's
entered
is
an
order
regarding
proration
of
the
estate
taxes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
it
has
and
yet
said
there
will
be
$7
million.
mr.
jack
s.levin
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
order
says
$12
million
and
then
work
it
down
to
$7.
they
just
say,
estate
taxes
will
be
allocated
to
the
grandchildren's
share.
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
jack
s.levin
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
don't
believe
the
record
shows
her
age.
it
shows
that
some
of
the
grandchildren
are
--
at
least
two
of
the
grandchildren
are
over
21
and
three
of
the
others
are
over
18
so
that
the
grandchildren
are
in
their
20s.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
--
since
this
is
a
summary
judgment
proceeding,
the
record
doesn't
show
anything
with
regard
to
agreement.
the
record
thus
shows
that
the
executor
came
in
and
asked
that
the
probate
court
allocate
all
of
the
taxes
to
the
grandchildren's
trust,
to
the
grandchildren's
share.
that
then
notice
was
given
to
all
the
relatives
that
the
two
adult
grandchildren
being
faced
with
having
their
interest
reduced
by
a
$150,000
each,
there
were
nine
grandchildren,
did
not
appear
despite
the
clear
language
of
the
will.
and
that
the
other
seven
grandchildren
who
were
represented
by
a
guardian
ad
litem,
the
guardian
ad
litem
filed
a
brief
in
which
he
cited
only
the
decisions
which
tended
to
indicate
that
the
estate
tax
should
be
taken
entirely
out
of
the
grandchildren's
trust.
he
explain
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
oh
yes,
your
honor.
the
commissioner
had
already
issued
a
notice
of
deficiency.
it
was
a
month
after
the
commissioner
issued
a
notice
of
deficiency
that
they
went
into
the
probate
court
as
coun
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
there
was
no
one
there.
no
one
was
there
to
present
the
government's
arguments.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
exactly
the
position
which
we
take,
your
honor.
and
six
of
the
eight
courts
of
appeals
that
have
ruled
on
it
had
come
out
our
way.
mr.
jack
s.levin
our
position
is
a
two-fold
one.
i
would
be
content
to
come
out
with
the
full
scope
of
the
--
of
the
provi
--
of
the
decision
that
we
are
never
bound.
our
position,
however,
is
that
long
ago
the
commissioner
gave
in
to
a
certain
extent
and
that
congress
has
gone
along
with
it.
the
commissioner
said
that
although
he's
not
required
to
do
so,
he
will
go
along
with
a
genuinely
litigated
adversary
judgment
of
a
probate
or
trial
court.
now,
the
commissioner
may
not
have
been
required
to
go
that
far
but
the
congress
seems
to
have
gone
along
with
them.
if
this
court
comes
out
with
result
that
the
commissioner
doesn't
have
to
go
that
far,
then
i
assume
the
commissioner
will
reassess
his
position.
it
will
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
we
state
in
our
brief,
in
the
footnote
on
page
27
that
we
advocate
this
nonadversary
rule
as
set
forth
in
the
brief
because
we
believe
that
it
better
accommodates
the
conflicting
interest
more
consistent
with
congress'
purpose,
etcetera.
should
the
court
reject
this
rule,
however,
we
urge
it
to
adopt
the
erie
rather
than
the
gallagher
approach.
that
is
we
urge
it
to
adopt
the
approach
that
the
commissioner
is
never
bound.
now,
perhaps
we
went
too
far
in
trying
to
reach
a
just
result,
we
felt
the
commissioner
had
done
that
beginning
in
1919.
he'd
said
that
he
would
go
along
with
an
adversary
decree
although
he
didn't
appear
to
have
to
and
that
congress
seemed
to
have
accepted
that
by
its
long
in
action
on
the
point
and
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
marital
deduction
provision.
but
if
this
court
finds
that
the
commissioner
doesn't
have
to
accept
it
in
any
case,
i'm
sure
the
commissioner
reassess
his
position
and
we
ask
the
court
to
reach
that
result
if
it
feels
it
the
better
one.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no.
your
honors,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
the
government
is
entitled
to
litigate
the
merits
of
its
tax
claims
in
the
federal
courts
rather
than
the
probate
courts.
and
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
its
decision,
in
which
it
said
that
the
government
was
never
bound
by
a
connecticut
probate
court
decree
regardless
of
whether
this
is
adversary
or
not,
pointed
out
that
the
characteristics
of
the
connecticut
probate
court
were
such
that
it
was
not
the
type
of
forum
that
should
ever
bind
the
government.
that
its
judges
were
not
--
its
judges
were
not
required
to
be
lawyers,
that
there
was
a
de
novo
appeal
from
that
court
to
another
court,
that
the
connecticut
probate
court
decisions
were
not
reported,
were
not
relied
upon
by
the
other
--
many
other
connecticut
probate
courts,
that
a
connecticut
probate
court
itself
didn't
refer
to
its
own
earlier
decisions,
and
that
there
were
ways
of
collaterally
attacking
connecticut
probate
court
decisions.
and
that
it
was
the
sort
of
a
court
that
was
there
to
sort
out
as
are
many
of
the
probate
courts
in
our
nation
to
sort
out
and
administer
essentially
nonadversary
proceedings.
the
grand
permission
to
trustees
to
do
this
or
that
or
permission
to
executors
to
take
certain
steps
and
that
it
was
very
seldom
that
you
had
an
adversary
proceedings
and
when
you
did
have
an
adversary
proceeding,
it
was
typical
to
take
it
to
a
higher
court,
take
the
de
novo
appeal
from
the
probate
court
or
perhaps
go
into
a
higher
level
trial
court,
try
it
out.
it
would
certainly
be
an
unusual
case
when
a
will,
this
clear,
when
the
grandchildren
were
really
intending
to
assert
their
rights
and
that
they
would
lose
over
$1
million,
the
exact
value
is
i
think
$1,300,000.
that
they
would
with
this
will
behind
them
stand
there,
lose
$1,300,000
and
then
not
take
their
de
novo
appeal,
and
in
fact,
not
even
have
contested
the
point
in
the
--
in
the
connecticut
probate
court
but
it
stood
there
and
said,
"we
have
no
objection."
we
don't
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
there's
certainly
no
evidence
that
their
adversary
did
to
each
other.
in
fact,
the
contrary
is
generally
true
if
they
can
rearrange
property
within
the
family
and
save
a
million
dollars,
gain
a
million
dollars
for
the
family,
the
tendency
generally
is
to
go
along
with
the
rearrangement.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
it
was
the
petitioner
who
served
it
unnoticed.
mr.
jack
s.levin
petitioner
was
the
executor
of
the
estate
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
same
petitioner
who's
here
before
you
was
the
moving
party
in
the
probate
court
decree.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
disposition
which
we
suggest
is
that
this
court
adopt
the
nonadversary
view
and
remand
the
case
for
findings
as
to
whether
this
was
a
nonadversary
proceeding
or
not.
no
evidence
yet
having
been
taken
on
that
issue
and
the
record
not
being
fully
developed
on
that
issue.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court,
as
some
justices
have
indicated,
feels
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
what
we
would
think
to
be
a
stiffer
position
that
the
probate
court
decrees
are
never
binding
and
that
in
order
for
anybody
to
get
a
decree
which
is
ever
binding
on
the
government
they
should
have
to
take
an
appeal.
well,
then
in
that
case,
the
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
which
decided
the
case
on
that
basis
in
favor
of
the
government.
mr.
jack
s.levin
then
the
--
then
the
question
which
is
already
been
determined
by
the
second
circuit
would
be
is
the
government
correct
on
its
interpretation
of
connecticut
law
and
the
second
circuit
has
already
clearly
answered
that
said
that
this
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
connecticut
law.
and
then
the
taxpayers
--
taxpayer
would
lose
in
his
refund
action.
the
government
would
keep
the
$1,300,000
which
they
have
paid
in
taxes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that
is
one
of
our
positions.
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
litigation.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
there's
a
great
deal
of
merit.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
contributes
to
harmonious
federal
state
relationships
if
the
probate
court
is
determining
in
effect
estate
tax
disputes.
the
probate
court
here
is
petitioner
considered
during
this
argument.
he
stated
during
his
argument.
probate
court
knew
here
that
it
was
in
effect
determining
whether
the
federal
government
got
a
million
dollars
in
estate
taxes
and
that
there
was
an
existing
dispute
between
the
commissioner
and
the
estate.
he
only
was
deciding
that.
i
submit
it
to
reach
the
result
petitioner
proposes
is
not
going
to
contribute
to
harmonious
federal
state
relationships.
mr.
jack
s.levin
and
we
think
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
think
that
the
clear
inference
from
the
code
and
from
the
legislative
history
precludes
us
from
taking
the
former
position
as
well
as
common
sense.
that
is
that
we're
always
bound
by
these
intrafamily
dispositions.
and
as
to
the
latter,
we
have
presented
both
views
to
the
court.
we
feel
that
it
is
a
workable
view
to
take
the
--
what
we
call
the
nonadversary
rule.
and
it
would
be
fair
to
the
parties,
and
that
would
achieve
a
not
unworkable
interrelationship
between
state
and
federal
courts
to
accept
litigated
decisions
but
not
accept
nonadversary
decisions.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
i
don't
think
our
brief
goes
that
far.
we
haven't
given
the
point
away.
we
haven't
said
we
want
to
be.
we've
said
there
were
two
arguments
which
we
presented
to
the
lower
court.
we
presented
both
arguments
to
the
lower
court.
we
won
on
the
broader
one.
in
coming
before
this
court,
we
felt
compelled
to
indicate
which
position
the
government
thought
was
the
better
position.
but
we
are
urging
upon
this
court
the
broader
position.
we
are
urging
that
position.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
of
a
single
instance
in
which
it's
happened
and
i
can't
conceive
of
one
from
my
limited
experience
with
a
probate
court.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
it's
difficult
to
say
just
how
contrary
the
will
has
to
be.
here
i
think
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
that
intelligent
lawyers
can
frequently
make
ambiguity
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
you
mean
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
if
the
will
said
i
leave
all
my
property
to
mr.
x
and
the
family
all
came
in
and
said,
"by
mr.
x,
you
really
meant
mrs.
y
is
who
happens
to
be
his
widow",
i
really
can't
answer
whether
a
probate
judge
would
do
that.
but
if
the
will
was
slightly
more
ambiguous
left
some
very
slight
room
for
doubt,
i
am
--
i
think
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
understood
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
understood
that
i
was
answering
on
the
basis
of
a
--
of
this
case
or
a
case
like
it
where
there
was
of
very
slight
room
for
ambiguity.
and
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to
--
to
indicate
a
broader
view
on
an
unequivocal
will
where
just
couldn't
be
anything
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
s.levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
which
presents
in
slightly
different
context
approximately
the
same
issue
as
was
presented
in
the
second
national
bank
case.
the
decedent
died
in
1957.
in
order
to
give
a
complete
picture
of
the
case,
i
have
to
explain
what
the
decedent
did
prior
to
his
death
and
then
move
up
to
the
situation
at
his
death.
in
1930,
he
created
a
revocable
trust.
and
that
trust
is
amended
in
1931,
granted
to
his
wife
the
income
from
the
trust
for
her
life,
and
gave
her
a
general
power
of
appointment
over
the
trust
assets
by
her
will.
if
the
decedent
had
died
at
that
point,
and
if
the
marital
deduction
had
been
enacted.
so
assume
he
died
say
in
1950,
marital
deduction
have
been
enacted
in
1948,
his
estate
would
have
received
a
marital
deduction
for
the
value
of
the
assets
in
that
estate,
because
she
was
at
that
time
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
generated
by
the
entire
trust
for
her
life
and
she
also
had
a
general
power
of
appointment
over
the
trust
assets.
however,
in
1951,
that's
approximately
six
years
before
the
decedent
died,
congress
enacted
the
powers
of
appointment
act
of
1951.
what
that
act
said
in
essence
was
that
anyone
who
has
a
general
power
of
appointment
which
would
cause
the
assets
subject
to
the
general
power
to
be
crea
--
to
be
taxed
in
their
estate
of
their
death,
here
that
means
the
widow,
may
release
in
toto
or
in
part
their
general
power
of
appointment
without
further
tax
significance.
so
that
it
enabled
someone
such
as
mrs.
bosch
here
to
release
her
general
power
of
appointment
or
to
release
enough
of
the
general
power
so
as
to
cut
it
down
to
a
special
power
of
appointment.
after
consulting
with
the
trustee
and
the
bank
here
involved,
mrs.
bosch
took
advantage
of
that
option.
she
executed
a
release
which
stated
that
she
released
the
power
to
appoint
to
herself
for
estate
or
creditors
or
the
creditors
of
her
estate
which
are
the
magic
words
for
a
general
power
of
appointment
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
if
that
release
is
effective,
she
cut
her
power
of
appointment
from
a
general
power
to
a
special
power.
thereafter,
six
years
later
in
1957,
mr.
bosch
died.
so
that
if
the
release
is
effective,
all
she
had
at
the
date
of
his
death
was
the
right
to
the
income
from
the
assets
for
her
life
plus
a
special
power
of
appointment.
federal
law
is
quite
clear.
no
one
argues
with
the
contrary
that
if
a
widow
has
only
income
plus
special
power,
no
marital
deduction.
commissioner
came
in,
took
the
position
that
she
was
entitled
to
only
a
special
power
of
appointment
as
of
the
time
of
mr.
bosch's
death.
therefore,
no
marital
deductions
to
be
allowed
with
regard
to
this
trust.
there
was
a
marital
deduction
with
regard
to
some
other
property
but
not
with
regard
to
this
trust.
after
the
case
was
in
the
tax
court,
the
respondent
initiated
a
suit
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
york,
state
trial
court,
in
which
the
respondent
took
the
position
that
the
court
should
declare.
now,
this
is
the
respondent
in
its
capacity
as
trustee
of
the
trust.
it
was
the
same
entity
who
was
also
executor
of
the
will.
respondent
took
the
position
that
the
release
made
in
1951
was
invalid
under
new
york
law.
and
therefore,
the
widow
still
had
a
general
power
of
appointment.
in
that
proceeding
--
well
first
of
all,
the
respondent
concedes
that
this
suit
was
prompted
by
the
tax
court
proceeding,
prompted
at
least
in
part
by
the
tax
court
proceeding.
three
briefs
were
filed
in
that
proceeding,
one
by
the
trustee
executor,
respondent
here;
one
by
the
widow,
by
this
time
the
widow,
the
life
beneficiary;
and
one
by
a
guardian
ad
litem
or
a
possible
minor
beneficiary.
all
three
briefs
took
the
same
position.
all
three
briefs
argued
that
the
six-year
old
by
this
time
i
guess
about
eight
or
nine
years
old
release
was
a
nullity,
was
void.
and
therefore,
that
she
still
had
a
general
power
of
appointment.
in
the
tax
court
in
describing
this
proceeding,
counsel
for
respondent
stated
as
follows
in
open
court.
all
these
briefs,
this
is
page
15
of
the
record,
excuse
me.
all
these
briefs
took
the
same
tap;
this
is
counsel
for
respondent
speaking.
all
these
briefs
took
the
same
tap,
or
presented
the
same
side
of
the
argument.
that
is
this
1951
instrument
was
a
nullity.
and
in
effect,
you
have
to
cut
down
the
general
power
of
appointment.
thereafter
the
court,
the
tax
court
judge
asks
this
question,
"was
the
proceeding
nonadversary
in
the
sense
that
no
one
had
any
interest
in
the
courts
coming
out
one
way
or
the
other?"
counsel
for
respondent
replied,
"you
might
say
that
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
effect,
nobody
raised
the
dissenting
voice
in
these
proceedings."
there
were
22
other
possible
beneficiaries
who
are
in
the
same
position
as
this
minor
who've
been
represented
by
a
guardian
ad
litem.
the
other
22
received
notice.
they
declined
to
appear.
no
appearance
was
found,
the
only
three
briefs
with
the
three
arguing
that
it
was
a
nullity.
the
parties
in
their
pleadings
in
the
suit
and
in
the
briefs
made
it
quite
clear
to
the
state
court
that
a
determination
that
this
release
was
a
nullity,
we
would
say
the
substantial
amount
of
estate
tax
for
the
family.
in
addition,
the
parties
in
their
briefs
failed
to
cite
relevant
cases
and
to
make
relevant
arguments
to
the
court
which
would
have
indicated
that
the
release
was
valid.
the
court
then
adopted
their
unanimous
contention.

jack
s.levin
power
to
exercise.
mr.
jack
s.levin
under
new
york
law.
that
was
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
the
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
i
say
the
court
was
wrong.
judge
friendly
in
his
dissent,
judge
friendly
was
the
only
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
who
reached
the
issue.
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
court
was
right
or
wrong."
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
proceeding
was
adversary
or
nonadversary.
we're
bound.
that's
what
the
two
judges
in
the
majority
in
the
second
circuit
said.
this
is
the
same
court
that
decided
the
second
national
bank
case
that
you
just
heard,
three
different
judges
sitting.
the
court
said
that
we
need
not
reach
therefore
the
question
whether
it
was
an
adversary
proceeding.
we
need
not
reach
the
question
whether
the
new
york
court
was
right
or
wrong.
judge
friendly
on
the
other
hand
in
his
dissent
and
that's
--
that's
the
only
opinion
i
can
say
here
on
the
merits
of
the
new
york
case,
examined
it
in
some
detail.
found
that
the
new
york
supreme
court's
decision
was
clearly
wrong.
found
that
the
parties
had
not
cited
to
the
new
york
court
the
relevant
decisions
indicating
that
the
release
was
valid.
found
that
the
only
case
cited
by
the
new
york
court
in
reaching
its
decision
was
in
the
matter
of
piffard
and
decided
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
1888.
when
in
fact
the
new
york
statute
which
was
here
in
question,
which
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
a
power
of
appointment
could
be
released
wasn't
enacted
until
60
years
later.
so
that
in
the
matter
of
piffard
could
be
a
scant
authority
on
the
question
of
whether
a
power
of
appointment
can
be
released
under
a
1951
statute
when
it
was
decided
in
1888.
judge
friendly
thereafter
reached
--
reached
the
result
first
that
the
new
york
court
was
clearly
wrong.
second,
the
relevant
precedents
and
arguments
have
not
been
cited
to
it
or
made
to
it.
third,
the
proceeding
was
clearly
nonadversary.
and
he
said
these,
"under
these
circumstances,
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
that
a
judge
sitting
in
the
busy
motion
part
of
the
supreme
court
for
new
york
county
should
have
erroneously
ratified
the
parties
unanimous
contention
citing
only
the
in
opposite
decision
of
in
re
piffard."
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
correct.
this
was
not
a
probate
proceeding.
mr.
jack
s.levin
they
went
here
and
initiated
what
was
in
essence
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
county
proceedings,
something
of
that
nature
in
the
supreme
court
for
new
york
county.
mr.
jack
s.levin
and
as
i
understand
it
this
was
decided
in
--
in
the
motion
part.
and
parties
took
this
unanimous
position
there.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
we
think
that
it's
rather
difficult
to
reconcile
their
decisions.
they
purported
to
--
by
they,
i
mean
the
second
panel,
the
panel
in
this
case
purported
to
reconcile
its
decision
with
the
second
national
bank
case
by
saying,
well
the
second
national
bank
case
dealt
with
the
probate
court
of
connecticut.
that's
a
sort
of
a
funny
court.
its
judges
don't
have
to
be
lawyers.
there's
a
de
novo
right
of
appeal.
its
decisions
really
aren't
very
meaningful.
the
thing
that
troubles
us
about
that
is
that
the
authorities
of
connecticut
have
reposed
in
the
connecticut
probate
court
the
authority
to
make
decisions,
just
as
the
authorities
of
new
york
that
reposed
it
in
the
new
york
supreme
court.
and
we
think
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
rule
to
administer
to
say
that
it
depends
on
the
statute
or
the
status
of
the
court.
and
that
you
have
to
go
into
the
judicial
system
of
the
50
states
and
examine
the
type
of
courts
you
have
here.
mr.
jack
s.levin
excuse
me
i
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
no
en
banc
hearing
was
sought
by
the
governments,
your
honor.
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
was
that
this
was
not
merely
an
intracircuit
conflict.
there
was
a
much
more
general
conflict.
you
have
eight
courts
of
appeals
which
have
passed
on
this
issue.
of
the
eight,
six
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
the
nonadversary
view.
the
seventh
court
of
appeals
is
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
that
court
of
appeals
initiating
what
we
call
the
gallagher
rule
has
adopted
the
rule
that
anything
that's
binding
on
the
parties
is
binding
on
the
government.
and
i
don't
think
i've
overstated
their
position
because
they
say
if
there
was
fraud
involved,
well
then
it's
not
binding
on
the
parties.
but
i
think
that
it
goes
first
say
it's
binding
on
the
parties
as
binding
on
the
government.
the
second
circuit
up
until
these
two
decisions
had
gone
along
with
the
majority
rule
which
was
the
six
--
six
courts
that
said
nonadversary.
the
first
case,
the
second
national
bank
case,
pushed
the
second
circuit
over
at
least
so
far
as
the
connecticut
probate
court
was
concerned
into
the
freuler
position
never
binding.
didn't
make
it
clear
what
its
position
would
be
on
other
courts.
then
this
case,
the
bosch
case,
pushed
the
second
circuit
way
off
in
the
other
direction
and
aligned
it
with
the
third
circuit,
what
judge
friendly
called
the
mechanical
rule
that
what's
binding
on
the
parties
is
binding
on
the
--
on
the
federal
government.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
judge
friendly
and
that
the
second
circuit
was
wrong
in
the
connecticut
national
bank,
the
connec
--
the
second
national
bank
case
and
that
it
should
have
come
out
the
other
way
and
held
that
one
binding,
but
this
one
not
binding.
he
did
say
this
and
i
think
this
was
a
sentence
to
which
it
refers.
what
makes
this
case
so
easy
is
that
the
state
court
proceeding
had
no
significant
purpose
other
than
the
reduction
of
tax
liability.
mrs.
bosch
was
not
shown
to
have
the
slightest
intention
of
using
the
general
power
the
new
york
court
was
led
to
thrust
upon
her.
or
even
the
special
one
if
she
was
held
to
have
only
that.
in
a
practical
sense,
the
decision
was
thus
to
void
of
any
effect
except
upon
taxes.
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
you
call
a
decision
a
regular
decision,
one
that
the
parties
had
to
seek
or
whether
you
say
that
they
went
out
and
got
a
decision
they
didn't
need.
respondent
in
this
case
argues
that
their
decision
was
one
that
they
had
to
seek.
no
accounting
had
been
sought
for
this
trust
in
the
33
years
of
its
existence.
so
they
said,
"we
had
to
go
into
a
court
and
get
into
accounting."
now,
in
the
process
of
getting
this
accounting
which
of
course
was
prompted
by
the
existing
federal
tax
case,
we
also
presented
the
issue
to
the
court
of
whether
this
was
a
general
or
a
special
power
which
is
the
issue
of
whether
the
release
was
valid.
now,
of
course
they
say,
"we
had
to
get
a
ruling
on
this
at
some
time
because
the
widow
might
have
exercised
the
power.
and
she's
entitled
to
know
what
her
powers
are.
and
we're
entitled
to
know
so
we're
not
in
breach
of
our
trust."
i
don't
think
that
that
makes
any
difference
if
they
go
into
the
connecticut
court,
here
the
new
york
court.
and
they
present
one
side
of
an
issue
to
a
busy
motion
part
of
new
york
county.
and
they
don't
cite
the
cases
on
the
other
side.
and
they
take
a
unanimous
position.
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
it's
a
part
of
a
regular
probate
proceeding
that
they
--
that
they
get
it
or
whether
it's
especially
initiated
accounting
suit.
mr.
jack
s.levin
he
knew
about
it
because
of
course,
proceedings
were
going
on
a
tax
court
at
this
time.
and
the
commissioner
knew
that
these
parties
were
going
to
go
off
to
the
new
york
state
court
and
seek
some
sort
of
declaratory
judgment
on
that.
the
lawyer
for
the
commissioner
stated
in
open
court
that
it
is
a
policy
of
the
commissioner,
uniform
policy
for
many
years,
not
to
participate
in
these
proceedings
going
on
in
probate
courts
or
state
trial
courts
across
the
country.
and
that
that
was
his
position.
he
told
the
parties
in
advanced
that
that
was
our
position
and
that
we
would
not
be
bound
by
it.
they
went
of
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
here
again,
as
in
the
last
case,
the
government
has
two
theories
which
it's
asserting.
i'm
pointing
out
that
the
fact
that
it
was
a
nonadversary
proceeding,
is
what
it
makes
it
such
a
nice
--
i
don't
want
to
use
a
word
that
that
is
derogatory
device
say
such
a
nice
device
for
obtaining
post
death
--
post
mortem
estate
planning
by
intrafamily
arrangements.
the
fact
that
it's
a
nonadversary
proceeding
where
everybody
goes
in
knowing
what
result
they
would
like
to
reach
and
succeeding
in
getting
the
court
to
reach
that
result
is
what
makes
it
so
susceptible.
but
of
course,
we
are
here
also
urging
the
broader
view.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.levin
our
brief
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
if
that's
--
it's
a
question
perhaps
of
emphasis,
your
honor.
in
the
typical
run
of
the
mind
case,
the
vast
majority
case,
you
had
no
state
proceeding
whatsoever.
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
that
come
up
in
the
federal
court,
the
state
court
hasn't
determined
the
state
issue.
and
you
have
the
federal
courts
setting
to
litigate
tax
issues,
deciding
state
issues
all
the
time,
applying
the
erie
doctrine
and
saying
now,
"what
is
the
law
of
connecticut
on
this
point
or
the
trust
law?"
it
happens
that
an
income
tax
cases,
estate
tax
cases,
every
kind
of
tax
case,
they
typically
decide
it.
it's
the
infrequent
case
where
the
parties
in
the
process
of
a
tax
dispute
true
brought
to
the
state
court
and
ask
the
state
court
to
give
them
a
decree
which
they
can
then
go
back
to
the
federal
court
and
waive
and
say,
"see,
the
state
court
has
decided
this
precise
issue
and
we
are
now
bound
by
it,
and
you
should
be."
that
doesn't
happen
except
in
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
cases.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
assume
it
did
come
about
in
ordinary
course.
but
very
frequently
the
estate
waits
until
the
federal
government
has
determined
the
estate
tax
and
made
these
determinations.
then
they
go
back
to
the
state
court
with
the
federal
government's
determinations.
if
they
want
to
litigate
it,
they
litigate
it
in
the
federal
courts.
they
don't
try
to
jump
the
gun
so
to
speak
and
to
get
the
connecticut
probate
court
to
rule
in
advance
as
to
how
you
allocate
federal
estate
taxes
when
the
federal
estate
taxes
haven't
been
computed
yet
and
they're
engage
in
a
dispute
with
the
commissioner
over
and
to
do
that,
especially
in
a
nonadversary
proceeding
where
everyone
files
briefs
pointing
the
same
way,
and
leaves
out
the
decisions.
the
reason
that
we
think
that
the
question
of
nonadversary
is
a
relevant
one
is
because
for
one
thing,
there
could
arise
a
case,
i
don't
know
of
a
single
one.
but
there
could
arise
a
case
whether
it
has
actually
been
litigation.
and
the
parties
have
resolved
the
disputes
for
litigation.
the
court
has
reached
the
decision
which
is
close
but
perhaps
later
proves
to
be
erroneous
on
closer
examination.
and
in
that
sort
of
a
case,
it
seems
rather
unfair
for
the
commissioner
to
refuse,
to
accept
that
result.
but
in
the
case
where
the
parties
make
no
effort
in
--
in
this
case
that
the
other
beneficiaries
in
the
second
national
bank
case,
the
grandchildren,
make
no
effort
to
assert
their
obvious
rights.
but
rather
by
their
whole
demeanor
and
their
position,
they
show
that
they
are
relinquishing
their
rights
without
a
fight.
it's
really
no
different
than
if
they
are
giving
away
their
rights.
and
the
commissioner
shouldn't
be
required
to
treat
it.
and
now
you
can
go
to
full
--
to
full
extent
and
say,
"well
because
that
sort
of
a
determination
is
difficult
to
make
whether
it
was
adversary
or
nonadversary,
we
will
hold
the
state
trial
court
or
probate
court
decision
as
never
binding."
mr.
jack
s.levin
no.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
quite
that
strong.
judge
raum
here
had
a
situation
where
the
tax
court
had
unanimously
along
with
six
of
the
circuits
adopted
fairly
unanimously
adopted
the
nonadversary
view
through
the
years,
long
history
back
beginning
as
early
as
1926.
and
he
knew
that
that
the
courts
of
appeals
at
least
the
third
circuit
had
disagreed.
he
wrote
in
opinion
here
which
i
don't
think
it's
clear
on
just
what
position
he
is
taking.
he
ends
his
position
by
his
--
his
opinion
by
saying
that
he
need
not
determine
whether
the
decision
is
binding
on
him
or
not.
mr.
jack
s.levin
he
ends
his
opinion
with
these
two
sentences
on
page
24
of
the
record.
nor
is
it
necessary
to
say
that
we
are
bound
by
the
new
york
decision,
it
is
sufficient
merely
the
state
that
in
a
foregoing
circumstances
we
accept
the
new
york
decision
as
an
authoritative
exposition
of
new
york
law
and
the
adjudication
of
the
property
rights
involved.
now,
i
can't
do
anymore
than
to
read
that
and
try
to
interpret
it.
he
said
he
doesn't
feel
himself
bound
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say
something
that
doesn't
seem
quite
consistent.
that
of
course,
as
i've
said,
is
a
departure
from
the
view
of
the
tax
court
long
held.
the
history
and
perhaps
what
help
it
by
very
briefly
sketch
out
the
history
of
this
from
the
earliest
indications
of
congressional
intention
on
it.
and
that,
there
as
follows,
in
1919,
long
before
the
marital
deduction
had
been
enacted,
the
commissioner
promulgated
regulations
under
what
is
now
section
2053
of
the
code,
we've
set
the
regulations
for.
the
question
there
is
does
the
estate
get
a
deduction
for
a
claim
against
the
estate?
in
other
words,
a
probate
court
determines
mr.
x
is
a
creditor.
mr.
x
happens
to
be
the
testator's
son.
do
they
get
a
deduction
for
that
if
he
was
a
genuine
creditor
that
gets
a
deduction?
some
people
had
go
into
probate
courts
and
the
logical
beneficiary
would
come
in
and
say,
"my
father
really
owed
me
$400,000
so
please
distribute
it
to
me
as
creditor
rather
than
his
beneficiary."
there
have
been
decisions
to
that
effect.
so
the
1919
regulations
under
that
section
indicate
that
the
commissioner
will
not
accept
the
decision
that
mr.
x
is
a
creditor
unless
it
was
--
it
was
wrong.
if
it
was
wrong,
it
won't
be
accepted
unless
it
was
litigated
adversary
proceeding.
then
in
1926
in
the
krause
case,
the
tax
court
for
the
first
time
had
a
--
that
sort
of
a
question
before
it.
and
it
indicated
that
it
was
going
along
with
this
sort
of
reasoning.
and
the
tax
court
decisions
thereafter
up
until
this
one
are
fairly
well
along
that
line.
the
next
relevant
guide
post
is
the
brainard
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
1937
so
far
as
i
know
the
first
court
of
appeal
decision
on
that.
we
quote
from
that
in
our
brief.
that
decision
can
be
read
two
ways.
it
can
be
read
as
supporting
either
the
so-called
erie
view
was
never
bound
or
the
adversary
view.
the
court
says,
"this
is
a
decision
of
cook
county,
illinois
circuit
court."
we're
not
bound
by
it.
there
are
lots
of
courts
but
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
point
out
the
circuit
court
decision
from
cook
county
was
a
proceeding
between
this
man
and
his
wife,
and
mother.
and
he
ends
with
the
sentence.
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
the
preferred
decree
is
binding
up
on
the
parties
to
that
suit.
and
it
will
not
be
appealed
from
because
all
the
parties
thereto
are
satisfied
with
it.
so
this
1937
decision
contains
the
germs
of
the
nonadversary
rule.
he's
saying
it
was
a
proceeding
between
the
man,
his
mother,
and
his
wife,
and
nobody
appealed
because
everybody
was
satisfied
with
it.
that
in
1940,
the
third
circuit,
the
circuit
is
now
against
this,
in
the
mechanics
bank
case
also
adopted
the
same
sort
of
a
rule.
and
of
course
was
subsequently
departed
from.
in
1947,
the
commissioner
published
disposition
that
he's
not
going
to
go
in
and
litigate
the
state
probate
courts
and
trial
courts.
then
in
this
context,
in
1948,
one
year
after
this
pronounced
by
the
commissioner,
congress
enacts
the
marital
deduction
provision.
and
congress
in
the
legislative
history
says
that
in
interpreting
the
question
in
whether
you
get
a
marital
deduction
as
to
an
interpretation
of
the
will.
how
much
does
the
widow
entitled
to
under
the
will
if
she
had
enforced
her
rights
and
everyone
had
enforced
their
rights?
congress
said
this
in
the
legislative
history
cited
on
page
16
of
our
brief.
in
this
connection,
proper
regard
should
be
given
to
interpretations
of
the
will
rendered
by
a
court
in
a
bona
fide
adversary
proceeding.
later
on
in
that
same
page,
congress
went
on
to
say;
that
a
settlement
between
the
parties
is
not
binding
on
the
commissioner
will
not
be
accepted
even
if
it
sets
the
party's
rights.
now,
in
this
context,
one
year
later,
the
commissioner
enacted
regulations
under
the
marital
deduction
provisions.
it
was
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
these
regulations,
very
much
like
the
1919
regulations
for
claims
against
the
estate
indicate
that
the
commissioner
is
not
bound
unless
you
have
a
proceeding
in
a
state
trial
court
rendered
on
the
merits
in
an
adversary
proceeding
following
a
genuine
and
act
of
contest.
at
that
point,
the
litigation
is
still
going
on.
1954,
of
course
congress
reenacted
the
marital
deduction
provision
in
this
context
of
what
i
think
clear
legislative
history,
clear
and
uniform
proceedings.
in
1955,
a
year
later,
the
third
circuit
decides
the
gallagher
case
in
which
it
overrules
in
effect
its
older
cases,
and
decides
that
from
now
on,
the
commissioner
is
bound
by
a
nonadversary
proceeding.
the
third
circuit
went
so
far
as
in
the
beecher
case
decided
a
short
time
later
to
say
that
where
the
sons
and
daughters
came
in
and
said,
"we're
really
creditors
and
sought
quickly
to
prove
their
claims
against
the
estate
that's
binding
on
the
commissioner."
mr.
jack
s.levin
in
the
very
brief
time
that
i
have
remaining,
i'd
like
to
make
just
two
of
perhaps
three
very
short
points.
first
is
that
the
law
of
the
50
states
is
not
at
all
clear
but
the
united
states
has
the
right
to
intervene
in
every
conceivable
type
of
proceeding.
we
haven't
had
time
to
research
the
law
of
all
the
states
but
at
least
in
connecticut,
it
certainly
not
clear
that
the
united
states
could
have
come
in
to
this
probate
court,
intervene,
obtain
the
right
to
appeal
about
if
the
decisions
were
against
it,
etcetera.
this
is
something
that's
rather
tricky
and
rather
difficult
even
if
the
united
states
wanted
to
go
in
even
if
congress
appropriated
all
the
money
so
that
we
could
go
in
and
hire
the
requisite
attorneys
to
be
present
in
all
these
states
to
appear
in
these
proceedings.
second
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
the
question
of
new
york
law
as
i
explained
for
the
majority
decline
to
decide
it.
and
what
i
take
it
respondent
is
saying
is
that
even
if
there
were
a
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
directly
contrary
to
its
position
which
had
not
been
cited
by
any
party
to
the
new
york
supreme
court.
and
the
reason
it
had
not
been
cited
is
because
nobody
was
presenting
that
position
but
that
that
they
had
gone
in
there
and
wait
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
i
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
that's
certainly
not
--
not
the
decision
stated
by
the
parties,
detectors,
and
either
these
cases
in
their
briefs.
mr.
jack
s.levin
their
position
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
their
position
and
the
position
of
the
third
circuit
and
of
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
is
that
a
decision
of
the
state
lower
court,
the
state
probate
or
trial
court
is
final
and
binding.
not
that
there's
an
exception
if
you
can
find
a
state
decision
of
another
court
that
goes
the
other
way.
final
and
binding,
and
that's
the
end
even
if
it's
adversary
and
even
if
it's
clearly
wrong.
that's
their
position
as
i
understand
it.
and
a
very
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
decision
as
to
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
which
question,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
we
did
not
ask
this
court
to
decide
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
didn't
think
that
was
a
relevant
question
to
bring
before
this
court.
especially
because
the
new
york
legislature
has
now
overruled
the
instant
decision
by
a
statute
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
so
that
it's
a
question
of
no
continuing
importance
to
the
particular
new
york
question.
but
it's
the
sort
of
thing
that
comes
up
all
the
time.
if
this
court
adopts
our
view,
then
it
can
remand
the
case
to
the
federal
court
of
appeals
to
pass
for
the
first
time
on
the
question
of
new
york
law.
we
believe
that
we're
clearly
correct
if
it
ever
reaches
the
question
of
new
york
laws,
judge
friendly
points
out.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
think
that
this
court
may
well
decide
that
question.
i
don't
whether
it's
a
--
we
should
ask
you
with
the
solicitor
general's
option,
ask
you
to
decide
it
and
spend
your
time
on
it.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes,
i
think
your
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes,
that's
correct.
i
think
this
court
can
dispose
the
case
ultimately
and
finally
here.
mr.
jack
s.levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
and
by
the
succeeding
companion
case
is
whether
an
erroneous
state
probate
court
decree
or
it's
a
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
that
of
course
is
--
is
what
my
brother
here
has
argued
here
at
some
length.
i
think
that
we
would
not
have
brought
the
next
case
to
this
court
or
acquiesced
in
this
case
if
we
thought
that
we
are
presenting
to
this
court
solely
a
question
or
primarily
a
question
of
connecticut
law,
or
as
in
the
next
case
of
new
york
law.
in
order
for
us
to
present
the
question
which
we
seek
here
to
present,
we
must
first
either
assume
or
convince
you
that
the
decision
of
the
connecticut
probate
court
is
wrong.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
as
a
matter
of
connecticut
law.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
in
deciding
--
in
deciding
what
connecticut
law
is
certainly
a
decision
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court
or
of
the
connecticut
appellate
courts
intermediate
appellate
courts
would
be
very
relevant.
this
case
was
not
appealed.
mr.
jack
s.levin
if
this
case
went
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
it
would
certainly
be
binding.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes,
for
the
purposes
of
this
tax
case
and
i
should
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
determining
connecticut
law
in
any
case
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
would
accept
it
as
binding
if
it
had
been
adversary
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
jack
s.levin
even
though
in
our
view
erroneous.
we
think
that's
further
than
the
government
has
to
go
but
we
think
that
that's
fair
and
reaches
a
just
to
accommodation
between
the
interest
of
the
state
and
federal
courts.
mr.
jack
s.levin
let
me
state
my
position
at
a
slightly
greater
length
because
it's
--
it's
not
that
easy
to
state.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
at
least
three
possible
views
that
can
be
taken.
the
one
view
which
is
taken
by
the
petitioner
here
is
that
a
state
probate
or
trial
court
decision
is
always
binding
on
the
federal
government
regardless
of
whether
it's
erroneous,
regardless
of
whether
its
adversary,
it's
always
binding.
mr.
jack
s.levin
but
they're
not
binding
on
the
party
as
i've
said.
well
without
exploring
the
very
--
the
exact
ramifications
at
what
point,
what
collusive
means,
and
at
what
point
fraud
becomes
into
play,
in
general,
that's
his
position.
i
don't
mean
to
overstate
his
position.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
the
other
frueler
view
and
one
which
we
present
in
our
brief
is
that
the
state
court,
trial
court
decision
is
never
binding,
that
the
federal
government
looks
to
the
law
of
the
state.
there
is
then
an
intermediate
view
that
the
state
court
decision
should
be
accepted
so
long
as
it
was
an
adversary
decision
and
a
genuine
determination
after
all
the
parties
appeared
before.
there
were
conflicting
interests.
a
genuine
controversy
presented
to
the
court.
both
sides
of
the
issue
argued
and
the
court
made
an
actual
determination
having
been
fully
informed
of
the
issues,
the
precedents,
and
having
a
--
received
the
full
judicial
treatment
what
courts
are
all
about.
that
we
would
--
we
present
in
our
brief
those
three
positions.
we
say
that
we
are
not
abandoning
here
position
which
we
have
stated
for
the
other
--
for
the
lower
courts
that
the
decision
of
a
state
trial
court
when
it's
wrong
is
never
binding.
we're
not
abandoning
that.
but
after
an
examination
of
the
question,
the
government
feels
that
the
more
just
position,
the
more
rational
position,
the
way
to
your
position,
both
with
respect
to
congressional
intent,
the
legislative
history,
the
decided
cases,
the
regulations
and
all
other
indications
is
that
a
state
decision
which
is
a
genuine
adversary
litigation
should
be
adopted
by
the
commissioner
and
followed.
mr.
jack
s.levin
in
the
lower
court,
we
--
we
presented
both
positions.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
took
the
--
tended
toward
the
erie
position
though
not
adopting
the
full
scope.
they
pointed
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
the
rule
for
other
cases
being
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
because
in
the
ordinary
diversity
case,
the
very
parties
before
you
have
not
litigated
the
issue.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
in
an
ordinary
diversity
case,
if
a
and
b
are
litigating
an
issue,
the
federal
court
looks
to
state
decisions
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
between
x
and
y
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
to
determine
what
the
law
is.
but
if
a
and
b
have
already
had
their
rights
parceled
out
in
a
judicial
determination
in
which
they
pointed
out,
the
federal
court
will
normally
(voice
overlap)
by
that.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
think
that
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
the
erie
doctrine
applies
there
or
not.
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
both
sides
of
that
issue.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
clear
that
the
erie
doctrine
applies
there.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
present
the
issue
in
the
context
of
a
federal
tax
case.
this
case
was
simplified
facts
to
show
why
we
think
it's
unfair
to
the
commissioner
to
bind
him
by
a
nonadversary
decision
obtained
by
the
parties
who
all
took
one
side
of
an
issue,
and
yet
perhaps
unfair
to
the
parties
to
say
that
the
commissioner
will
ignore
an
adversary
determination.
but
it's
something
that
i
can
illustrate,
i
think
better
by
using
this
chart
in
a
simplified
version
of
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
now,
as
i
say,
this
is
a
simplified
version
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
estate
here
is
not
12
million
but
somewhere
around
13.
but
to
make
the
figures
work
out,
i
have
used
the
figure
12
million
for
the
estate
in
this
case.
the
question
is
how
much
is
the
widow
entitled
to
receive
net
under
the
terms
of
this
will
and
without
any
relinquishment
of
their
rights
by
the
other
beneficiaries.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
marital
deduction
gives
a
deduction
to
the
estate
for
the
amount
which
the
widow
was
entitled
to
receive
under
the
will,
and
that
any
action
after
the
date
of
death
by
the
other
beneficiaries
to
relinquish
their
rights
and
to
transfer
more
property
to
the
widow,
then
she
would
have
been
entitled
to
receive,
had
everyone
adhered
to
and
demanded
their
full
rights
that
that
cannot
increase
the
marital
deduction.
in
other
words,
if
the
widow
is
entitled
to
receive
$2
million
and
the
grandchildren
were
entitled
to
receive
$4
million
under
the
will
as
the
commissioner
contends,
and
if
the
children
had
said,
"no,
we
renounced
our
rights
as
to
two
extra
million
dollars
so
that
they'll
pass
to
the
widow
and
she'll
get
four
and
we'll
get
two,"
it's
quite
clear.
now,
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
about
this
point.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
widow
would
still
only
get
that
the
estate
would
still
only
get
a
marital
deduction
for
$2
million.
you
cannot
increase
the
marital
deduction
by
this
activity.
now,
under
the
position
taken
by
the
commissioner
which
is
that
the
will
clearly
unequivocally
provide
that
the
connecticut
proration
statute
will
not
apply,
this
would
be
the
situation.
and
if
you
will
let
me
for
a
moment,
i
will
assume
that
the
commissioner
is
correct.
and
then
later
on,
i
will
argue
as
i
did
in
the
brief
what
connecticut
law
provides.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
--
that
the
question
have
general
importance
here.
i
will
get
to
it.
if
the
commissioner
is
correct,
you
got
in
estate
of
$12
million.
you
got
in
estate
tax
payable
of
$6
million.
now,
i
worked
that
out
in
advanced
because
the
estate
tax
depends
on
the
amounts
the
widow
will
get.
and
the
amounts
the
widow
will
get
depend
on
the
estate
tax.
there's
a
simple
formula
for
working
it
out,
it's
done
all
the
time.
i've
done
it
in
advance.
the
estate
tax
will
be
$6
million.
the
remainder
of
$6
million
will
go
as
the
will
provides
one-third
to
the
widow
or
$2
million
and
two-thirds
to
the
grandchildren
or
$4
million.
the
commissioner
then
says,
"you're
entitled
to
a
deduction
of
$2
million
for
the
marital
deduction.
and
your
estate
tax
is
therefore
$6
million."
the
petitioner
goes
into
the
probate
court.
now,
i
want
to
make
this
for
this
is
after
the
commissioner
has
taken
his
position,
issued
a
30-day
notice
of
deficiency
which
is
a
formal
letter
stating
his
position.
after
that
has
happened,
the
commissioner
has
made
his
position
clear.
petitioner
then
goes
into
probate
court
and
he
files,
the
executor
files
a
document
there,
requesting
that
the
probate
court
hold
that
the
will
does
not
unequivocally
negates
the
proration
statute,
and
that
the
court
therefore
holds
that
the
estate
be
distributed
differently.
he
says,
therefore,
the
widow
should
get
one-third
of
the
estate
before
any
taxes
are
paid.
that
is
$4
million.
once
you
determine
that
the
widow
gets
$4
million
that
would
make
the
estate
tax
$5
million.
and
the
remainder
that's
left
over
or
$3
million
would
go
to
the
grandchildren.
now,
here's
the
will
that
says
one-third
to
the
widow,
two-thirds
to
the
grandchildren.
and
under
their
interpretation,
the
widow
who
is
getting
one-third
would
end
up
with
more
than
the
grandchildren
who
were
suppose
to
get
two-thirds.
that's
a
question
of
connecticut
law.
i
think
we're
quite
clearly
correct,
the
second
circuit
agreed
but
i'm
trying
to
illustrate
a
broader
principle
here.
now,
what
happens
as
we
see
it,
when
you
have
this
nonadversary
proceeding
in
the
probate
court
where
all
the
parties
come
in
and
say,
"we
agree
your
honor."
all
the
parties
come
in
at
filed
briefs.
their
grandchildren
--
even
though
the
grandchildren
didn't
bother
to
appear
the
guardian
ad
litem
policy,
everybody
said
to
the
probate
judge,
"we
have
no
objection".
we
agree
the
pro
--
the
estate
should
be
divided
up
like
this.
what
really
happens
is
as
follows.
what
really
happens
is
that
the
grandchildren
have
relinquished
a
portion
of
their
rights
to
the
extent
of
$1
million
to
the
widow.
so
that
they're
not
getting
$4
million
anymore,
they're
getting
$3
million.
they've
transferred
a
million
to
the
widow.
and
the
effect
of
their
transferring
$1
million
to
the
widow
is
to
give
any
greater
marital
deduction.
and
by
that
effect,
to
force
the
commissioner
or
the
united
states
to
give
up
an
additional
$1
million
so
that
what
happens
is
that
by
the
grandchildren
consenting
to
relinquish
their
rights
to
the
extent
of
$1
million
to
the
widow,
decreasing
their
--
decreasing
their
bequest
from
$4
million
to
$3
million,
increasing
her
bequest
from
$2
to
$3,
they
forced
the
commissioner
if
that's
adopted,
to
reduce
the
estate
tax
from
$6
to
$5
and
saving
to
the
family
is
an
additional
million
dollars.
so
by
transferring,
by
an
intrafamily
transfer
agreed
upon,
nobody
disputing
it,
everybody
coming
in
and
presenting
a
uniform
position
to
the
probate
court
by
the
briefs
which
don't
cite
the
cases
that
go
the
other
way.
don't
make
the
argument
which
we
make.
by
this
intrafamily
transfer
of
a
million
dollars
which
they
disguised
by
having
the
probate
court,
approve
it,
they
in
effect
cut
the
estate
tax
by
$1
million.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
purpose
is
to
illustrate
hopefully
--
hopefully
without
getting
into
too
many
numbers,
the
fact
that
what
we
have
in
most
of
these
cases,
and
they
arise
quite
frequently,
the
purpose
is
that
when
you
have
this
probate
court
decreased,
you
have
intrafamily
shifts
of
property.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
here's
--
if
you
would
have
to
argue
the
correct
as
the
probate
court
decree
first,
that's
a
question
of
connecticut
law.
i
would
like
to
deal
with
it
very
quickly.
i
think
it's
an
easy
issue.
you
got
a
will
which
is
as
clear
as
any
will
i've
ever
seen
in
negating
the
proration
statute,
provides
that
i
direct
the
executors
to
pay
my
taxes
out
of
the
residue
of
the
estate
and
the
provisions
of
any
statute
requiring
the
apportionment
or
proration
of
such
taxes
among
the
beneficiaries
of
this
will,
shall
be
without
effect
in
the
settlement
of
--
of
my
debts.
it's
clearly
as
you
can
make
it,
he
has
provided
that
the
proration
statute
shall
not
be
applicable
in
his
codicil,
he
provides
that
in
all
other
respects,
"i
hereby
republish
and
confirm
my
will."
he
has
indicated
no
intention
to
change
the
--
the
proration
statute
negation
which
he
put
in
this
original
will.
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
--
in
our
brief
which
indicate
that
that's
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
jack
s.levin
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
let
me
try
to
answer
why.
i
--
the
government
will
be
satisfied
if
the
court
adopts
the
so-called
erie-freuler
position.
that
is
the
easiest
position
for
us
to
take
in
the
lower
courts
and
we'll
be
perfectly
happy
to
have
that
position
as
we
state
in
our
briefs.
but
in
fairness
to
the
court,
we
wish
to
point
out
to
try
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
white's
question,
we
think
we
should
point
out
the
effect
that
this
would
have.
assume
for
just
a
moment
that
the
grandchildren
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
alright.
mr.
jack
s.levin
assume
for
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
alright.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no.
i
don't
say
bona
fide
proceeding.
i
don't
know
what
bona
fide
means.
i'm
talking
about
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
here's
what
i
mean
by
that.
assume
that
the
grandchildren
here
and
the
widow
were
at
odds
with
each
other.
perhaps
they
were
the
grandchildren
by
another
marriage.
she
was
a
later
wife
and
they
were
at
odds
with
each
other.
that
the
grandchildren
went
into
the
probate
court
and
said,
"no,
no
we
are
entitled
to
the
four
$4
million,
not
the
$3
million."
and
the
widow
took
the
--
took
the
position
that
she
was
entitled
to
the
$4
million.
and
they
actually
tried
and
litigated
the
case.
and
at
the
end
of
the
litigation,
the
probate
court
reached
a
decision
which
was
wrong.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
district
director
was
given
notice
that
a
proceeding
would
be
held.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that
decision
was
made
over
20
years
ago.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
he
would
--
they
did
not
purport
to
join
him
as
a
party
and
of
course,
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
sue
him.
mr.
jack
s.levin
they
gave
him
a
piece
of
paper
which
told
him
that
the
hearing
would
be
held.
that's
correct.
now,
that
the
question
that
you
raised
is,
why
shouldn't
i
take
it?
why
shouldn't
the
district
director's
people
or
the
government's
counsel
appear
in
these
probate
courts?
and
if
they
want
to
litigate
the
question,
litigate
it
in
the
probate
court.
well
it
is
our
position
that
that's
a
judgment
for
congress
to
make
and
that
congress
has
made
the
judgment.
but
here's
why.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
the
government's
position
was
the
same.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
government's
position
was
the
same
and
it
was
formulated.
the
reason
that
the
government
has
taken
this
position
is
because
an
assessment
was
made
over
20
years
ago
as
to
whether
the
government,
united
states
should
attempt
to
participate
in
the
many,
many
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
probate
proceedings,
declaratory
judgment
proceedings.
as
you'll
see
in
the
next
case,
it
was
not
a
probate
proceeding
in
bosch.
it
was
sort
of
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
in
the
new
york
supreme
court,
the
trial
court
there
whether
the
government
should
go
around
the
country
appearing
in
the
various
local
courts
especially
probate
courts.
and
an
assessment
made
of
the
manpower
available,
the
familiarity
of
the
government
with
the
procedures
in
these
various
courts.
you
have
now
50
states.
at
that
time
you
had
48
states.
you've
got
a
limited
amount
of
manpower.
you've
got
the
situation
where
the
government
doesn't
always
know
just
what's
at
stake.
if
that
rule
were
that
the
government
had
to
participate
in
all
these
proceedings,
i
suppose
it
would
be
very
simple
to
amend
all
the
forms
so
that
in
addition
to
giving
50
or
100
relatives
notice
of
every
type
of
hearing
that
went
on
in
every
probate
court
in
the
country,
you
merely
added
the
district
director's
name.
and
the
united
states
would
get
notice
of
all
these
proceedings.
the
united
states
wouldn't
come
near
having
the
manpower
under
the
existing
appropriations,
i
don't
believe,
to
appear
in
these
proceedings,
to
take
a
meaningful
part,
to
ascertain
in
the
flood
of
mail
that
would
come
in
carrying
notices
of
proceedings
of
all
kinds.
which
proceedings
were
meaningful?
which
ones
it
should
participate
in?
for
that
reason,
the
commissioner
published,
put
out
a
release
in
1947.
and
if
i
have
time,
i'll
give
the
history
up
to
1947
but
1947,
he
put
out
a
release,
in
which
he
said,
and
judge
friendly
discusses
this
in
a
footnote
in
his
dissent
in
--
in
bosch.
in
which
the
commissioners
said
that,
"we
will
not
go
into
these
probate
court
proceedings."
we
will
not
attempt
to
answer
notices
and
go
in.
this
is
well
known.
everyone
knows
it.
i
believe
that
congress
knows
it.
i
think
the
legislative
history,
as
i'll
get
to
in
just
a
moment
of
the
marital
deduction
provision
which
was
passed
subsequently
for
the
first
time,
tends
to
indicate
that
congress
knew
that
the
commissioner
was
not
going
to
go
in
and
create
an
adversary
proceeding
out
of
these
proceedings
which
were
really
intrafamily
proceedings
in
probate
courts.
now,
if
congress
wants
to
change
it
to
appropriate
additional
funds,
to
make
available
of
the
additional
lawyers
that
throughout
the
union
in
the
50
states
so
that
the
government
can
appear,
i
think
that's
a
decision
for
congress
to
make.
the
government,
the
executive
branch,
doesn't
feel
that
it
can
do
it
in
the
absence
of
this
direction.
and
that's
why
we
didn't
appear
in
this
probate
court
proceeding.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
the
government
has
never
appeared
in
a
probate
court
proceeding.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
the
third
circuit
has
adopted,
it's
the
only
circuit
which
has
unequivocally
adopted
the
contrary
rule,
the
rule
that
tax
bearer
here
seeks.
in
the
third
circuit
where
for
the
last
11
years,
we
have
been
found
by
these
nonadversary
probate
court
proceedings,
the
government
has
on
a
few
occasions
knowing
that
it
was
going
to
be
bound
in
the
absence
of
a
later
decision
by
this
court,
appeared
in
the
probate
court.
but
that's
one
state
in
a
few
proceedings.
this
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
i
--
the
only
area
that
i
was
able
to
come
up
with
as
discussed
in
our
fairly
lengthy
footnote,
the
social
security
area.
sometimes
you
get
in
the
question
of
whether
state
probate
or
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
somebody
was
the
widow
or
wife
of
someone
else
is
relevant
for
social
security.
and
there,
the
lower
courts
have
split
on
what
relevance
this
has.
they've
gone
into
the
legislative
history
and
looked
to
see
what
congress
intended
and
there
are
some
decisions
each
way(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
s.levin
it
--
in
many
respects,
divorce
law
of
course
is
different
because
divorce
is
a
status
which
--
which
one
can
wonder
whether
the
judiciary
should
get
into
in
the
legislative
branch,
and
the
executive
of
course
have
made
these
decisions
in
many
states,
every
state
that
they
should
get
into
it.
but
i
think
that
marriage
is
in
many
respects
different.
but
even
in
the
marriage
area,
this
court
and
the
state
courts
have
recognized
that
a
nonadversary
proceeding
between
husband
and
wife
does
not
always
bind
other
people
issue
as
to
rights
of
inheritance
as
to
custody,
as
to
alimony
as
to
--
as
to
other
items.
i'm
not
saying
that
marriage
is
necessary
an
analogy
here.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
you
have
a
nonadversary
proceeding
in
a
state
probate
court
which
makes
intrafamily
shifts
of
property
that
that
shouldn't
bind
the
commissioner.
that
shouldn't
bind
the
commissioner
anymore
perhaps
than
the
marriage
situation
binds
third
parties.
but
here
i
think
we've
got
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
don't
ask
them
to
fight.
certainly
we
don't
ask
them
to
fight.
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
just
say
that
if
they
don't
want
--
if
they
don't
determine
it
among
themselves.
and
if
they
just
come
in
and
everyone
takes
the
position,
yes,
give
the
widow
$4
million.
everyone
takes
that
position.
they
shouldn't
bind
the
commissioner.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i'd
be
happy
to
go
further
and
say
that
the
commissioner
should
never
accept
it.
we
present
that
position
in
our
brief.
we
asked
that
court
--
we
ask
this
court
to
take
the
position
that
a
probate
court
decree
is
never
binding
or
a
lower
court
decree
is
never
binding.
the
government
will
succeed,
will
win
these
cases.
in
fact,
it
would
be
a
much
easier
rule
for
us
to
--
to
apply
if
you
took
the
complete
freuler
position.
the
government
is
never
bound
by
a
trial
or
probate
court
decree.
and
i'd
be
happy
to
argue
for
that
here.
i
do
at
some
length
in
the
brief.
it's
just
that
it
seems
that
in
many
cases
in
the
few
cases,
not
in
many,
in
the
few
cases
where
there
has
been
a
genuine
litigation,
a
genuine
argument
between
the
parties.
and
one
side
has
lost
after
making
a
full
presentation
to
the
court
that
it
seems
more
in
accord
with
our
adversary
system
for
the
commissioner
to
accept
that.
his
regulations
which
have
been
extends
since
1919
in
one
area,
and
since
1949
in
the
marital
deduction
area
seemed
to
accept
a
--
an
adversary
genuinely
litigated
decision
right
or
wrong.
they
go
--
they
indicate
that
if
it's
not
a
genuinely
litigated
decision,
they
will
not
accept
it.
but
congress
has
reenacted
the
code
many
times
since
1919.
the
vast
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
that
view.
now,
legislative
history
is
a
marital
deduction
provision
which
was
enacted
in
1948
indicates
that
congress
too
was
adopting
this
view.
but
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
have
this
court
come
out
with
the
so-called
erie
position
that
the
government
is
never
bound
by
a
state
trial
court.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
that's
not
an
easy
question
to
resolve.
so
far
as
i
know
this
--
this
estate
has
not
yet
been
distributed.
the
money
insofar
as
i
know
is
still
on
the
hands
of
the
probate
court.
the
typical
thing
in
these
cases,
in
probate
cases
is
to
hold
the
money
until
the
estate
taxes
are
all
parceled
out.
but
whether
the
connecticut
probate
court
could
now
reverse
itself
and
go
back
the
other
way
is
something
that
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
connecticut
law
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
is
not
clear
on
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
precluded
from
what?
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
certainly
the
grandchildren
if
they
all
agreed
to
do
so
could
reverse
themselves
the
decision
originally
made.
what
you
are
asking
is
having
in
effect
may
the
gift
of
a
million
dollar
is
over
here,
can
they
now
say,
"well
if
the
federal
government
won't
recognized
if
we
can
take
it
back."
mr.
jack
s.levin
second
circuit
of
course
came
out
the
other
way
very
clearly.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
could
give
the
money
back,
i
suppose.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
grandchildren,
to
give
the
money
back
if
they
have
control.
mr.
jack
s.levin
excuse
me,
your
honor.
the
widow
could
give
the
money
back.
you're
saying
if
the
widow
doesn't
consent,
that
the
widow
says,
"oh
no,
i've
got
--
i've
got
the
extra
million.
it's
a
come
to
me."
probate
court
won't
reverse
itself
and
i
won't
reverse
myself.
the
answer
is
no,
i
don't
see
that
there's
anything
that
they
can
do.
but
the
grandchildren
are
not
paying
any
tax.
it's
not
as
if
we're
taxing
the
grandchildren
a
million
dollars
they
didn't
get
--
they
don't
pay
a
tax.
the
tax
is
paid
by
the
estate.
the
question
is
in
computing
the
estate
tax
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
how
do
you
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
it
would
also
make
a
big
difference
if
the
grandchildren
being
ignorant
of
federal
estate
tax
law
had
come
in
and
filed
a
renunciation
said,
"we
renounced
to
the
extent
of
$1
million."
probate
courts
says
that
i
accept
your
renunciation
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
then
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
that
may
be
very
true
if
the
probate
court
will
not
reverse
itself.
that
may
be
very
--
maybe
the
effect
of
renouncing
your
rights,
of
giving
up
your
rights
in
a
judicial
proceeding
of
consenting.
you
may
then
be
bound
and
you
may
not
be
able
to
withdraw
your
renunciation
at
a
later
time.
i
don't
think
that's
unusual.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
the
record
clearly
shows
that
no
one
presented
any
other
view.everyone
came
in
at
filed
briefs,
saying
that
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
i
don't
think
that's
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
if
this
court
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
reason
we
ask
for
a
remand
is
because
the
decision
was
originally
made
on
summary
judgment.
there
has
never
been
a
trial
of
this
issue
of
adversary
in
this
or
not.
in
other
words,
the
petitioner
came
in
and
said
to
the
court,
"we
don't
think
whether
it's
an
adversary
decision
or
not
matters."
we
ask
you
to
hold
that
the
federal
courts
are
bound
by
this
decree,
adversary
or
not.
they
took
the
legal
position
that
it
wasn't
relevant.
the
district
court
disagreed
with
them
but
agreed
with
them
on
connecticut
law.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
as
a
matter
of
connecticut
law,
but
also
agreed
that
it
wasn't
relevant
whether
there
was
an
adversary
proceeding
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
has
taken
the
position
that
you're
never
bound
by
a
state
court
decree
adversary
or
not.
mr.
jack
s.levin
if
this
court
binds
that
whether
the
proceeding
was
adversary
in
the
connecticut
state
probate
court
is
a
relevant
fact,
then
i
think
the
court
has
to
remand
for
determination
of
that
fact.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
evidence
in
the
record
now
so
far,
there's
a
very
strong
and
that
this
was
a
nonadversary
proceeding.
but
it
would
certainly
be
unfair
if
i
were
to
preclude
the
petitioner
from
presenting
any
additional
evidence
it
might
have.
mr.
jack
s.levin
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
belligerency
what
we're
--
with
adversary
proceeding
as
we
explain
it
in
our
brief
means
that
two
sides
come
in.
each
say,
"we
believe
that
we're
entitled
to
win."
they
file
a
brief
setting
forth
the
arguments
in
their
favor.
and
they
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
they
wish
to
win.
here,
this
was
just
the
opposite.
everyone
came
in
and
says
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
that's
correct.
there
can't
be
an
adversary
proceeding
if
everyone
comes
into
a
court
and
says,
the
winner
says,
"i
think
i
should
win"
and
the
loser
comes
in
and
says,
"i
think
i
should
lose."
they
don't
cite
the
relevant
decisions
to
the
court.
they
don't
inform
the
court.
and
the
court
says,
"well,
i
supposed
--
the
whole
-the
whole
gist
of
our
system
of
courts
is
for
the
courts
to
reserve
their
energies
for
the
disputed
cases
where
they
actually
have
to
decide
an
existing
controversy."
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
i
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
that
in
many
of
those
cases,
you
don't
have
everyone
appearing
and
taking
the
same
position.
you
may
just
have
the
trustee
coming
in
and
saying,
"can
i
have
permission
to
do
a
certain
thing?"
the
court
grants
the
permission,
makes
a
cursory
inspection.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
of
course,
as
it's
a
renunciation,
and
outright
disclaimer
that
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
it's
already
been
paid.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
think
that's
up
to
the
probate
court
to
decide,
i
suppose.
mr.
jack
s.levin
it's
a
connecticut
law
question.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
that's
a
question
of
connecticut
law.
i
can't
answer
that
simply.
i
tried
to
research
that
as
to
whether
how
revisable
connecticut
decrees
are,
what
the
practice
of
the
probate
court
was.
there
aren't
a
lot
of
precedents
on
that
because
as
mr.
justice
fortas
points
out,
there
aren't
a
lot
of
contested
probate
court
decisions.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
probate
court
has
not
entered
a
final
order
of
distribution
yet.
the
only
order
it's
entered
is
an
order
regarding
proration
of
the
estate
taxes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
it
has
and
yet
said
there
will
be
$7
million.
mr.
jack
s.levin
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
order
says
$12
million
and
then
work
it
down
to
$7.
they
just
say,
estate
taxes
will
be
allocated
to
the
grandchildren's
share.
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
jack
s.levin
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
don't
believe
the
record
shows
her
age.
it
shows
that
some
of
the
grandchildren
are
--
at
least
two
of
the
grandchildren
are
over
21
and
three
of
the
others
are
over
18
so
that
the
grandchildren
are
in
their
20s.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
--
since
this
is
a
summary
judgment
proceeding,
the
record
doesn't
show
anything
with
regard
to
agreement.
the
record
thus
shows
that
the
executor
came
in
and
asked
that
the
probate
court
allocate
all
of
the
taxes
to
the
grandchildren's
trust,
to
the
grandchildren's
share.
that
then
notice
was
given
to
all
the
relatives
that
the
two
adult
grandchildren
being
faced
with
having
their
interest
reduced
by
a
$150,000
each,
there
were
nine
grandchildren,
did
not
appear
despite
the
clear
language
of
the
will.
and
that
the
other
seven
grandchildren
who
were
represented
by
a
guardian
ad
litem,
the
guardian
ad
litem
filed
a
brief
in
which
he
cited
only
the
decisions
which
tended
to
indicate
that
the
estate
tax
should
be
taken
entirely
out
of
the
grandchildren's
trust.
he
explain
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
oh
yes,
your
honor.
the
commissioner
had
already
issued
a
notice
of
deficiency.
it
was
a
month
after
the
commissioner
issued
a
notice
of
deficiency
that
they
went
into
the
probate
court
as
coun
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
there
was
no
one
there.
no
one
was
there
to
present
the
government's
arguments.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
exactly
the
position
which
we
take,
your
honor.
and
six
of
the
eight
courts
of
appeals
that
have
ruled
on
it
had
come
out
our
way.
mr.
jack
s.levin
our
position
is
a
two-fold
one.
i
would
be
content
to
come
out
with
the
full
scope
of
the
--
of
the
provi
--
of
the
decision
that
we
are
never
bound.
our
position,
however,
is
that
long
ago
the
commissioner
gave
in
to
a
certain
extent
and
that
congress
has
gone
along
with
it.
the
commissioner
said
that
although
he's
not
required
to
do
so,
he
will
go
along
with
a
genuinely
litigated
adversary
judgment
of
a
probate
or
trial
court.
now,
the
commissioner
may
not
have
been
required
to
go
that
far
but
the
congress
seems
to
have
gone
along
with
them.
if
this
court
comes
out
with
result
that
the
commissioner
doesn't
have
to
go
that
far,
then
i
assume
the
commissioner
will
reassess
his
position.
it
will
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
we
state
in
our
brief,
in
the
footnote
on
page
27
that
we
advocate
this
nonadversary
rule
as
set
forth
in
the
brief
because
we
believe
that
it
better
accommodates
the
conflicting
interest
more
consistent
with
congress'
purpose,
etcetera.
should
the
court
reject
this
rule,
however,
we
urge
it
to
adopt
the
erie
rather
than
the
gallagher
approach.
that
is
we
urge
it
to
adopt
the
approach
that
the
commissioner
is
never
bound.
now,
perhaps
we
went
too
far
in
trying
to
reach
a
just
result,
we
felt
the
commissioner
had
done
that
beginning
in
1919.
he'd
said
that
he
would
go
along
with
an
adversary
decree
although
he
didn't
appear
to
have
to
and
that
congress
seemed
to
have
accepted
that
by
its
long
in
action
on
the
point
and
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
marital
deduction
provision.
but
if
this
court
finds
that
the
commissioner
doesn't
have
to
accept
it
in
any
case,
i'm
sure
the
commissioner
reassess
his
position
and
we
ask
the
court
to
reach
that
result
if
it
feels
it
the
better
one.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no.
your
honors,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
the
government
is
entitled
to
litigate
the
merits
of
its
tax
claims
in
the
federal
courts
rather
than
the
probate
courts.
and
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
its
decision,
in
which
it
said
that
the
government
was
never
bound
by
a
connecticut
probate
court
decree
regardless
of
whether
this
is
adversary
or
not,
pointed
out
that
the
characteristics
of
the
connecticut
probate
court
were
such
that
it
was
not
the
type
of
forum
that
should
ever
bind
the
government.
that
its
judges
were
not
--
its
judges
were
not
required
to
be
lawyers,
that
there
was
a
de
novo
appeal
from
that
court
to
another
court,
that
the
connecticut
probate
court
decisions
were
not
reported,
were
not
relied
upon
by
the
other
--
many
other
connecticut
probate
courts,
that
a
connecticut
probate
court
itself
didn't
refer
to
its
own
earlier
decisions,
and
that
there
were
ways
of
collaterally
attacking
connecticut
probate
court
decisions.
and
that
it
was
the
sort
of
a
court
that
was
there
to
sort
out
as
are
many
of
the
probate
courts
in
our
nation
to
sort
out
and
administer
essentially
nonadversary
proceedings.
the
grand
permission
to
trustees
to
do
this
or
that
or
permission
to
executors
to
take
certain
steps
and
that
it
was
very
seldom
that
you
had
an
adversary
proceedings
and
when
you
did
have
an
adversary
proceeding,
it
was
typical
to
take
it
to
a
higher
court,
take
the
de
novo
appeal
from
the
probate
court
or
perhaps
go
into
a
higher
level
trial
court,
try
it
out.
it
would
certainly
be
an
unusual
case
when
a
will,
this
clear,
when
the
grandchildren
were
really
intending
to
assert
their
rights
and
that
they
would
lose
over
$1
million,
the
exact
value
is
i
think
$1,300,000.
that
they
would
with
this
will
behind
them
stand
there,
lose
$1,300,000
and
then
not
take
their
de
novo
appeal,
and
in
fact,
not
even
have
contested
the
point
in
the
--
in
the
connecticut
probate
court
but
it
stood
there
and
said,
"we
have
no
objection."
we
don't
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
there's
certainly
no
evidence
that
their
adversary
did
to
each
other.
in
fact,
the
contrary
is
generally
true
if
they
can
rearrange
property
within
the
family
and
save
a
million
dollars,
gain
a
million
dollars
for
the
family,
the
tendency
generally
is
to
go
along
with
the
rearrangement.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
it
was
the
petitioner
who
served
it
unnoticed.
mr.
jack
s.levin
petitioner
was
the
executor
of
the
estate
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
same
petitioner
who's
here
before
you
was
the
moving
party
in
the
probate
court
decree.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
disposition
which
we
suggest
is
that
this
court
adopt
the
nonadversary
view
and
remand
the
case
for
findings
as
to
whether
this
was
a
nonadversary
proceeding
or
not.
no
evidence
yet
having
been
taken
on
that
issue
and
the
record
not
being
fully
developed
on
that
issue.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court,
as
some
justices
have
indicated,
feels
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
what
we
would
think
to
be
a
stiffer
position
that
the
probate
court
decrees
are
never
binding
and
that
in
order
for
anybody
to
get
a
decree
which
is
ever
binding
on
the
government
they
should
have
to
take
an
appeal.
well,
then
in
that
case,
the
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
which
decided
the
case
on
that
basis
in
favor
of
the
government.
mr.
jack
s.levin
then
the
--
then
the
question
which
is
already
been
determined
by
the
second
circuit
would
be
is
the
government
correct
on
its
interpretation
of
connecticut
law
and
the
second
circuit
has
already
clearly
answered
that
said
that
this
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
connecticut
law.
and
then
the
taxpayers
--
taxpayer
would
lose
in
his
refund
action.
the
government
would
keep
the
$1,300,000
which
they
have
paid
in
taxes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that
is
one
of
our
positions.
mr.
jack
s.levin
--
litigation.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
there's
a
great
deal
of
merit.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
contributes
to
harmonious
federal
state
relationships
if
the
probate
court
is
determining
in
effect
estate
tax
disputes.
the
probate
court
here
is
petitioner
considered
during
this
argument.
he
stated
during
his
argument.
probate
court
knew
here
that
it
was
in
effect
determining
whether
the
federal
government
got
a
million
dollars
in
estate
taxes
and
that
there
was
an
existing
dispute
between
the
commissioner
and
the
estate.
he
only
was
deciding
that.
i
submit
it
to
reach
the
result
petitioner
proposes
is
not
going
to
contribute
to
harmonious
federal
state
relationships.
mr.
jack
s.levin
and
we
think
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
we
think
that
the
clear
inference
from
the
code
and
from
the
legislative
history
precludes
us
from
taking
the
former
position
as
well
as
common
sense.
that
is
that
we're
always
bound
by
these
intrafamily
dispositions.
and
as
to
the
latter,
we
have
presented
both
views
to
the
court.
we
feel
that
it
is
a
workable
view
to
take
the
--
what
we
call
the
nonadversary
rule.
and
it
would
be
fair
to
the
parties,
and
that
would
achieve
a
not
unworkable
interrelationship
between
state
and
federal
courts
to
accept
litigated
decisions
but
not
accept
nonadversary
decisions.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
i
don't
think
our
brief
goes
that
far.
we
haven't
given
the
point
away.
we
haven't
said
we
want
to
be.
we've
said
there
were
two
arguments
which
we
presented
to
the
lower
court.
we
presented
both
arguments
to
the
lower
court.
we
won
on
the
broader
one.
in
coming
before
this
court,
we
felt
compelled
to
indicate
which
position
the
government
thought
was
the
better
position.
but
we
are
urging
upon
this
court
the
broader
position.
we
are
urging
that
position.
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
of
a
single
instance
in
which
it's
happened
and
i
can't
conceive
of
one
from
my
limited
experience
with
a
probate
court.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
it's
difficult
to
say
just
how
contrary
the
will
has
to
be.
here
i
think
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
think
that
intelligent
lawyers
can
frequently
make
ambiguity
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
you
mean
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
if
the
will
said
i
leave
all
my
property
to
mr.
x
and
the
family
all
came
in
and
said,
"by
mr.
x,
you
really
meant
mrs.
y
is
who
happens
to
be
his
widow",
i
really
can't
answer
whether
a
probate
judge
would
do
that.
but
if
the
will
was
slightly
more
ambiguous
left
some
very
slight
room
for
doubt,
i
am
--
i
think
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
understood
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
i
understood
that
i
was
answering
on
the
basis
of
a
--
of
this
case
or
a
case
like
it
where
there
was
of
very
slight
room
for
ambiguity.
and
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to
--
to
indicate
a
broader
view
on
an
unequivocal
will
where
just
couldn't
be
anything
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
s.levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
which
presents
in
slightly
different
context
approximately
the
same
issue
as
was
presented
in
the
second
national
bank
case.
the
decedent
died
in
1957.
in
order
to
give
a
complete
picture
of
the
case,
i
have
to
explain
what
the
decedent
did
prior
to
his
death
and
then
move
up
to
the
situation
at
his
death.
in
1930,
he
created
a
revocable
trust.
and
that
trust
is
amended
in
1931,
granted
to
his
wife
the
income
from
the
trust
for
her
life,
and
gave
her
a
general
power
of
appointment
over
the
trust
assets
by
her
will.
if
the
decedent
had
died
at
that
point,
and
if
the
marital
deduction
had
been
enacted.
so
assume
he
died
say
in
1950,
marital
deduction
have
been
enacted
in
1948,
his
estate
would
have
received
a
marital
deduction
for
the
value
of
the
assets
in
that
estate,
because
she
was
at
that
time
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
generated
by
the
entire
trust
for
her
life
and
she
also
had
a
general
power
of
appointment
over
the
trust
assets.
however,
in
1951,
that's
approximately
six
years
before
the
decedent
died,
congress
enacted
the
powers
of
appointment
act
of
1951.
what
that
act
said
in
essence
was
that
anyone
who
has
a
general
power
of
appointment
which
would
cause
the
assets
subject
to
the
general
power
to
be
crea
--
to
be
taxed
in
their
estate
of
their
death,
here
that
means
the
widow,
may
release
in
toto
or
in
part
their
general
power
of
appointment
without
further
tax
significance.
so
that
it
enabled
someone
such
as
mrs.
bosch
here
to
release
her
general
power
of
appointment
or
to
release
enough
of
the
general
power
so
as
to
cut
it
down
to
a
special
power
of
appointment.
after
consulting
with
the
trustee
and
the
bank
here
involved,
mrs.
bosch
took
advantage
of
that
option.
she
executed
a
release
which
stated
that
she
released
the
power
to
appoint
to
herself
for
estate
or
creditors
or
the
creditors
of
her
estate
which
are
the
magic
words
for
a
general
power
of
appointment
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
if
that
release
is
effective,
she
cut
her
power
of
appointment
from
a
general
power
to
a
special
power.
thereafter,
six
years
later
in
1957,
mr.
bosch
died.
so
that
if
the
release
is
effective,
all
she
had
at
the
date
of
his
death
was
the
right
to
the
income
from
the
assets
for
her
life
plus
a
special
power
of
appointment.
federal
law
is
quite
clear.
no
one
argues
with
the
contrary
that
if
a
widow
has
only
income
plus
special
power,
no
marital
deduction.
commissioner
came
in,
took
the
position
that
she
was
entitled
to
only
a
special
power
of
appointment
as
of
the
time
of
mr.
bosch's
death.
therefore,
no
marital
deductions
to
be
allowed
with
regard
to
this
trust.
there
was
a
marital
deduction
with
regard
to
some
other
property
but
not
with
regard
to
this
trust.
after
the
case
was
in
the
tax
court,
the
respondent
initiated
a
suit
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
york,
state
trial
court,
in
which
the
respondent
took
the
position
that
the
court
should
declare.
now,
this
is
the
respondent
in
its
capacity
as
trustee
of
the
trust.
it
was
the
same
entity
who
was
also
executor
of
the
will.
respondent
took
the
position
that
the
release
made
in
1951
was
invalid
under
new
york
law.
and
therefore,
the
widow
still
had
a
general
power
of
appointment.
in
that
proceeding
--
well
first
of
all,
the
respondent
concedes
that
this
suit
was
prompted
by
the
tax
court
proceeding,
prompted
at
least
in
part
by
the
tax
court
proceeding.
three
briefs
were
filed
in
that
proceeding,
one
by
the
trustee
executor,
respondent
here;
one
by
the
widow,
by
this
time
the
widow,
the
life
beneficiary;
and
one
by
a
guardian
ad
litem
or
a
possible
minor
beneficiary.
all
three
briefs
took
the
same
position.
all
three
briefs
argued
that
the
six-year
old
by
this
time
i
guess
about
eight
or
nine
years
old
release
was
a
nullity,
was
void.
and
therefore,
that
she
still
had
a
general
power
of
appointment.
in
the
tax
court
in
describing
this
proceeding,
counsel
for
respondent
stated
as
follows
in
open
court.
all
these
briefs,
this
is
page
15
of
the
record,
excuse
me.
all
these
briefs
took
the
same
tap;
this
is
counsel
for
respondent
speaking.
all
these
briefs
took
the
same
tap,
or
presented
the
same
side
of
the
argument.
that
is
this
1951
instrument
was
a
nullity.
and
in
effect,
you
have
to
cut
down
the
general
power
of
appointment.
thereafter
the
court,
the
tax
court
judge
asks
this
question,
"was
the
proceeding
nonadversary
in
the
sense
that
no
one
had
any
interest
in
the
courts
coming
out
one
way
or
the
other?"
counsel
for
respondent
replied,
"you
might
say
that
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
effect,
nobody
raised
the
dissenting
voice
in
these
proceedings."
there
were
22
other
possible
beneficiaries
who
are
in
the
same
position
as
this
minor
who've
been
represented
by
a
guardian
ad
litem.
the
other
22
received
notice.
they
declined
to
appear.
no
appearance
was
found,
the
only
three
briefs
with
the
three
arguing
that
it
was
a
nullity.
the
parties
in
their
pleadings
in
the
suit
and
in
the
briefs
made
it
quite
clear
to
the
state
court
that
a
determination
that
this
release
was
a
nullity,
we
would
say
the
substantial
amount
of
estate
tax
for
the
family.
in
addition,
the
parties
in
their
briefs
failed
to
cite
relevant
cases
and
to
make
relevant
arguments
to
the
court
which
would
have
indicated
that
the
release
was
valid.
the
court
then
adopted
their
unanimous
contention.

jack
s.levin

to
exercise.
mr.
jack
s.levin
under
new

that
was
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
right.
the

mr.
jack
s.levin

jack
s.levin

court
was

judge
friendly
in
his
dissent,
judge
friendly
was
the
only
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
who
reached
the
issue.
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
court
was
right
or
wrong."
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
proceeding
was
adversary
or
nonadversary.
we're
bound.
that's
what
the
two
judges
in
the
majority
in
the
second
circuit
said.
this
is
the
same
court
that
decided
the
second
national
bank
case
that
you
just
heard,
three
different
judges
sitting.
the
court
said
that
we
need
not
reach
therefore
the
question
whether
it
was
an
adversary
proceeding.

not
reach

question
whether
the
new

court
was
right
or
wrong.
judge
friendly
on
the
other
hand
in
his
dissent
and
that's
--
that's
the
only
opinion
i
can
say
here
on
the
merits
of
the
new
york
case,
examined
it
in
some
detail.
found
that
the
new
york
supreme
court's
decision
was
clearly
wrong.
found
that
the
parties
had
not
cited
to
the
new
york
court
the
relevant
decisions
indicating
that
the
release
was
valid.
found
that
the
only
case
cited
by
the
new
york
court
in
reaching
its
decision
was
in
the
matter
of
piffard
and
decided
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
1888.
when
in
fact
the
new
york
statute
which
was
here
in
question,
which
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
a
power
of
appointment
could
be
released
wasn't
enacted
until
60
years
later.
so
that
in
the
matter
of
piffard
could
be
a
scant
authority
on
the
question
of
whether
a
power
of
appointment
can
be
released
under
a
1951
statute
when
it
was
decided
in
1888.
judge
friendly
thereafter
reached
--
reached
the
result
first
that
the
new
york
court
was
clearly
wrong.
second,
the
relevant
precedents
and
arguments
have
not
been
cited
to
it
or
made
to
it.
third,
the
proceeding
was
clearly
nonadversary.
and
he
said
these,
"under
these
circumstances,
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
that
a
judge
sitting
in
the
busy
motion
part
of
the
supreme
court
for
new
york
county
should
have
erroneously
ratified
the
parties
unanimous
contention
citing
only
the
in
opposite
decision
of
in
re
piffard."
mr.
jack
s.levin
that's
correct.
this
was
not
a
probate
proceeding.
mr.
jack
s.levin
they
went
here
and
initiated
what
was
in
essence
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
county
proceedings,
something
of
that
nature
in
the
supreme
court
for
new
york
county.
mr.
jack
s.levin
and
as
i
understand
it
this
was
decided
in
--
in
the
motion
part.
and
parties
took
this
unanimous
position
there.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
we
think
that
it's
rather
difficult
to
reconcile
their
decisions.
they
purported
to
--
by
they,
i
mean
the
second
panel,
the
panel
in
this
case
purported
to
reconcile
its
decision
with
the
second
national
bank
case
by
saying,
well
the
second
national
bank
case
dealt
with
the
probate
court
of
connecticut.
that's
a
sort
of
a
funny
court.
its
judges
don't
have
to
be
lawyers.
there's
a
de
novo
right
of
appeal.
its
decisions
really
aren't
very
meaningful.
the
thing
that
troubles
us
about
that
is
that
the
authorities
of
connecticut
have
reposed
in
the
connecticut
probate
court
the
authority
to
make
decisions,
just
as
the
authorities
of
new
york
that
reposed
it
in
the
new
york
supreme
court.
and
we
think
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
rule
to
administer
to
say
that
it
depends
on
the
statute
or
the
status
of
the
court.
and
that
you
have
to
go
into
the
judicial
system
of
the
50
states
and
examine
the
type
of
courts
you
have
here.
mr.
jack
s.levin
excuse
me
i
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
no
en
banc
hearing
was
sought
by
the
governments,
your
honor.
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
was
that
this
was
not
merely
an
intracircuit
conflict.
there
was
a
much
more
general
conflict.
you
have
eight
courts
of
appeals
which
have
passed
on
this
issue.
of
the
eight,
six
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
the
nonadversary
view.
the
seventh
court
of
appeals
is
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
that
court
of
appeals
initiating
what
we
call
the
gallagher
rule
has
adopted
the
rule
that
anything
that's
binding
on
the
parties
is
binding
on
the
government.
and
i
don't
think
i've
overstated
their
position
because
they
say
if
there
was
fraud
involved,
well
then
it's
not
binding
on
the
parties.
but
i
think
that
it
goes
first
say
it's
binding
on
the
parties
as
binding
on
the
government.
the
second
circuit
up
until
these
two
decisions
had
gone
along
with
the
majority
rule
which
was
the
six
--
six
courts
that
said
nonadversary.
the
first
case,
the
second
national
bank
case,
pushed
the
second
circuit
over
at
least
so
far
as
the
connecticut
probate
court
was
concerned
into
the
freuler
position
never
binding.
didn't
make
it
clear
what
its
position
would
be
on
other
courts.
then
this
case,
the
bosch
case,
pushed
the
second
circuit
way
off
in
the
other
direction
and
aligned
it
with
the
third
circuit,
what
judge
friendly
called
the
mechanical
rule
that
what's
binding
on
the
parties
is
binding
on
the
--
on
the
federal
government.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
judge
friendly
and
that
the
second
circuit
was
wrong
in
the
connecticut
national
bank,
the
connec
--
the
second
national
bank
case
and
that
it
should
have
come
out
the
other
way
and
held
that
one
binding,
but
this
one
not
binding.
he
did
say
this
and
i
think
this
was
a
sentence
to
which
it
refers.
what
makes
this
case
so
easy
is
that
the
state
court
proceeding
had
no
significant
purpose
other
than
the
reduction
of
tax
liability.
mrs.
bosch
was
not
shown
to
have
the
slightest
intention
of
using
the
general
power
the
new
york
court
was
led
to
thrust
upon
her.
or
even
the
special
one
if
she
was
held
to
have
only
that.
in
a
practical
sense,
the
decision
was
thus
to
void
of
any
effect
except
upon
taxes.
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
you
call
a
decision
a
regular
decision,
one
that
the
parties
had
to
seek
or
whether
you
say
that
they
went
out
and
got
a
decision
they
didn't
need.
respondent
in
this
case
argues
that
their
decision
was
one
that
they
had
to
seek.
no
accounting
had
been
sought
for
this
trust
in
the
33
years
of
its
existence.
so
they
said,
"we
had
to
go
into
a
court
and
get
into
accounting."
now,
in
the
process
of
getting
this
accounting
which
of
course
was
prompted
by
the
existing
federal
tax
case,
we
also
presented
the
issue
to
the
court
of
whether
this
was
a
general
or
a
special
power
which
is
the
issue
of
whether
the
release
was
valid.
now,
of
course
they
say,
"we
had
to
get
a
ruling
on
this
at
some
time
because
the
widow
might
have
exercised
the
power.
and
she's
entitled
to
know
what
her
powers
are.
and
we're
entitled
to
know
so
we're
not
in
breach
of
our
trust."
i
don't
think
that
that
makes
any
difference
if
they
go
into
the
connecticut
court,
here
the
new
york
court.
and
they
present
one
side
of
an
issue
to
a
busy
motion
part
of
new
york
county.
and
they
don't
cite
the
cases
on
the
other
side.
and
they
take
a
unanimous
position.
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
it's
a
part
of
a
regular
probate
proceeding
that
they
--
that
they
get
it
or
whether
it's
especially
initiated
accounting
suit.
mr.
jack
s.levin
he
knew
about
it
because
of
course,
proceedings
were
going
on
a
tax
court
at
this
time.
and
the
commissioner
knew
that
these
parties
were
going
to
go
off
to
the
new
york
state
court
and
seek
some
sort
of
declaratory
judgment
on
that.
the
lawyer
for
the
commissioner
stated
in
open
court
that
it
is
a
policy
of
the
commissioner,
uniform
policy
for
many
years,
not
to
participate
in
these
proceedings
going
on
in
probate
courts
or
state
trial
courts
across
the
country.
and
that
that
was
his
position.
he
told
the
parties
in
advanced
that
that
was
our
position
and
that
we
would
not
be
bound
by
it.
they
went
of
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
here
again,
as
in
the
last
case,
the
government
has
two
theories
which
it's
asserting.
i'm
pointing
out
that
the
fact
that
it
was
a
nonadversary
proceeding,
is
what
it
makes
it
such
a
nice
--
i
don't
want
to
use
a
word
that
that
is
derogatory
device
say
such
a
nice
device
for
obtaining
post
death
--
post
mortem
estate
planning
by
intrafamily
arrangements.
the
fact
that
it's
a
nonadversary
proceeding
where
everybody
goes
in
knowing
what
result
they
would
like
to
reach
and
succeeding
in
getting
the
court
to
reach
that
result
is
what
makes
it
so
susceptible.
but
of
course,
we
are
here
also
urging
the
broader
view.
mr.
jack
s.levin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.levin
our
brief
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
no,
if
that's
--
it's
a
question
perhaps
of
emphasis,
your
honor.
in
the
typical
run
of
the
mind
case,
the
vast
majority
case,
you
had
no
state
proceeding
whatsoever.
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
that
come
up
in
the
federal
court,
the
state
court
hasn't
determined
the
state
issue.
and
you
have
the
federal
courts
setting
to
litigate
tax
issues,
deciding
state
issues
all
the
time,
applying
the
erie
doctrine
and
saying
now,
"what
is
the
law
of
connecticut
on
this
point
or
the
trust
law?"
it
happens
that
an
income
tax
cases,
estate
tax
cases,
every
kind
of
tax
case,
they
typically
decide
it.
it's
the
infrequent
case
where
the
parties
in
the
process
of
a
tax
dispute
true
brought
to
the
state
court
and
ask
the
state
court
to
give
them
a
decree
which
they
can
then
go
back
to
the
federal
court
and
waive
and
say,
"see,
the
state
court
has
decided
this
precise
issue
and
we
are
now
bound
by
it,
and
you
should
be."
that
doesn't
happen
except
in
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
cases.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
assume
it
did
come
about
in
ordinary
course.
but
very
frequently
the
estate
waits
until
the
federal
government
has
determined
the
estate
tax
and
made
these
determinations.
then
they
go
back
to
the
state
court
with
the
federal
government's
determinations.
if
they
want
to
litigate
it,
they
litigate
it
in
the
federal
courts.
they
don't
try
to
jump
the
gun
so
to
speak
and
to
get
the
connecticut
probate
court
to
rule
in
advance
as
to
how
you
allocate
federal
estate
taxes
when
the
federal
estate
taxes
haven't
been
computed
yet
and
they're
engage
in
a
dispute
with
the
commissioner
over
and
to
do
that,
especially
in
a
nonadversary
proceeding
where
everyone
files
briefs
pointing
the
same
way,
and
leaves
out
the
decisions.
the
reason
that
we
think
that
the
question
of
nonadversary
is
a
relevant
one
is
because
for
one
thing,
there
could
arise
a
case,
i
don't
know
of
a
single
one.
but
there
could
arise
a
case
whether
it
has
actually
been
litigation.
and
the
parties
have
resolved
the
disputes
for
litigation.
the
court
has
reached
the
decision
which
is
close
but
perhaps
later
proves
to
be
erroneous
on
closer
examination.
and
in
that
sort
of
a
case,
it
seems
rather
unfair
for
the
commissioner
to
refuse,
to
accept
that
result.
but
in
the
case
where
the
parties
make
no
effort
in
--
in
this
case
that
the
other
beneficiaries
in
the
second
national
bank
case,
the
grandchildren,
make
no
effort
to
assert
their
obvious
rights.
but
rather
by
their
whole
demeanor
and
their
position,
they
show
that
they
are
relinquishing
their
rights
without
a
fight.
it's
really
no
different
than
if
they
are
giving
away
their
rights.
and
the
commissioner
shouldn't
be
required
to
treat
it.
and
now
you
can
go
to
full
--
to
full
extent
and
say,
"well
because
that
sort
of
a
determination
is
difficult
to
make
whether
it
was
adversary
or
nonadversary,
we
will
hold
the
state
trial
court
or
probate
court
decision
as
never
binding."
mr.
jack
s.levin
no.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
quite
that
strong.
judge
raum
here
had
a
situation
where
the
tax
court
had
unanimously
along
with
six
of
the
circuits
adopted
fairly
unanimously
adopted
the
nonadversary
view
through
the
years,
long
history
back
beginning
as
early
as
1926.
and
he
knew
that
that
the
courts
of
appeals
at
least
the
third
circuit
had
disagreed.
he
wrote
in
opinion
here
which
i
don't
think
it's
clear
on
just
what
position
he
is
taking.
he
ends
his
position
by
his
--
his
opinion
by
saying
that
he
need
not
determine
whether
the
decision
is
binding
on
him
or
not.
mr.
jack
s.levin
he
ends
his
opinion
with
these
two
sentences
on
page
24
of
the
record.
nor
is
it
necessary
to
say
that
we
are
bound
by
the
new
york
decision,
it
is
sufficient
merely
the
state
that
in
a
foregoing
circumstances
we
accept
the
new
york
decision
as
an
authoritative
exposition
of
new
york
law
and
the
adjudication
of
the
property
rights
involved.
now,
i
can't
do
anymore
than
to
read
that
and
try
to
interpret
it.
he
said
he
doesn't
feel
himself
bound
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say
something
that
doesn't
seem
quite
consistent.
that
of
course,
as
i've
said,
is
a
departure
from
the
view
of
the
tax
court
long
held.
the
history
and
perhaps
what
help
it
by
very
briefly
sketch
out
the
history
of
this
from
the
earliest
indications
of
congressional
intention
on
it.
and
that,
there
as
follows,
in
1919,
long
before
the
marital
deduction
had
been
enacted,
the
commissioner
promulgated
regulations
under
what
is
now
section
2053
of
the
code,
we've
set
the
regulations
for.
the
question
there
is
does
the
estate
get
a
deduction
for
a
claim
against
the
estate?
in
other
words,
a
probate
court
determines
mr.
x
is
a
creditor.
mr.
x
happens
to
be
the
testator's
son.
do
they
get
a
deduction
for
that
if
he
was
a
genuine
creditor
that
gets
a
deduction?
some
people
had
go
into
probate
courts
and
the
logical
beneficiary
would
come
in
and
say,
"my
father
really
owed
me
$400,000
so
please
distribute
it
to
me
as
creditor
rather
than
his
beneficiary."
there
have
been
decisions
to
that
effect.
so
the
1919
regulations
under
that
section
indicate
that
the
commissioner
will
not
accept
the
decision
that
mr.
x
is
a
creditor
unless
it
was
--
it
was
wrong.
if
it
was
wrong,
it
won't
be
accepted
unless
it
was
litigated
adversary
proceeding.
then
in
1926
in
the
krause
case,
the
tax
court
for
the
first
time
had
a
--
that
sort
of
a
question
before
it.
and
it
indicated
that
it
was
going
along
with
this
sort
of
reasoning.
and
the
tax
court
decisions
thereafter
up
until
this
one
are
fairly
well
along
that
line.
the
next
relevant
guide
post
is
the
brainard
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
1937
so
far
as
i
know
the
first
court
of
appeal
decision
on
that.
we
quote
from
that
in
our
brief.
that
decision
can
be
read
two
ways.
it
can
be
read
as
supporting
either
the
so-called
erie
view
was
never
bound
or
the
adversary
view.
the
court
says,
"this
is
a
decision
of
cook
county,
illinois
circuit
court."
we're
not
bound
by
it.
there
are
lots
of
courts
but
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
point
out
the
circuit
court
decision
from
cook
county
was
a
proceeding
between
this
man
and
his
wife,
and
mother.
and
he
ends
with
the
sentence.
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
the
preferred
decree
is
binding
up
on
the
parties
to
that
suit.
and
it
will
not
be
appealed
from
because
all
the
parties
thereto
are
satisfied
with
it.
so
this
1937
decision
contains
the
germs
of
the
nonadversary
rule.
he's
saying
it
was
a
proceeding
between
the
man,
his
mother,
and
his
wife,
and
nobody
appealed
because
everybody
was
satisfied
with
it.
that
in
1940,
the
third
circuit,
the
circuit
is
now
against
this,
in
the
mechanics
bank
case
also
adopted
the
same
sort
of
a
rule.
and
of
course
was
subsequently
departed
from.
in
1947,
the
commissioner
published
disposition
that
he's
not
going
to
go
in
and
litigate
the
state
probate
courts
and
trial
courts.
then
in
this
context,
in
1948,
one
year
after
this
pronounced
by
the
commissioner,
congress
enacts
the
marital
deduction
provision.
and
congress
in
the
legislative
history
says
that
in
interpreting
the
question
in
whether
you
get
a
marital
deduction
as
to
an
interpretation
of
the
will.
how
much
does
the
widow
entitled
to
under
the
will
if
she
had
enforced
her
rights
and
everyone
had
enforced
their
rights?
congress
said
this
in
the
legislative
history
cited
on
page
16
of
our
brief.
in
this
connection,
proper
regard
should
be
given
to
interpretations
of
the
will
rendered
by
a
court
in
a
bona
fide
adversary
proceeding.
later
on
in
that
same
page,
congress
went
on
to
say;
that
a
settlement
between
the
parties
is
not
binding
on
the
commissioner
will
not
be
accepted
even
if
it
sets
the
party's
rights.
now,
in
this
context,
one
year
later,
the
commissioner
enacted
regulations
under
the
marital
deduction
provisions.
it
was
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
these
regulations,
very
much
like
the
1919
regulations
for
claims
against
the
estate
indicate
that
the
commissioner
is
not
bound
unless
you
have
a
proceeding
in
a
state
trial
court
rendered
on
the
merits
in
an
adversary
proceeding
following
a
genuine
and
act
of
contest.
at
that
point,
the
litigation
is
still
going
on.
1954,
of
course
congress
reenacted
the
marital
deduction
provision
in
this
context
of
what
i
think
clear
legislative
history,
clear
and
uniform
proceedings.
in
1955,
a
year
later,
the
third
circuit
decides
the
gallagher
case
in
which
it
overrules
in
effect
its
older
cases,
and
decides
that
from
now
on,
the
commissioner
is
bound
by
a
nonadversary
proceeding.
the
third
circuit
went
so
far
as
in
the
beecher
case
decided
a
short
time
later
to
say
that
where
the
sons
and
daughters
came
in
and
said,
"we're
really
creditors
and
sought
quickly
to
prove
their
claims
against
the
estate
that's
binding
on
the
commissioner."
mr.
jack
s.levin
in
the
very
brief
time
that
i
have
remaining,
i'd
like
to
make
just
two
of
perhaps
three
very
short
points.
first
is
that
the
law
of
the
50
states
is
not
at
all
clear
but
the
united
states
has
the
right
to
intervene
in
every
conceivable
type
of
proceeding.
we
haven't
had
time
to
research
the
law
of
all
the
states
but
at
least
in
connecticut,
it
certainly
not
clear
that
the
united
states
could
have
come
in
to
this
probate
court,
intervene,
obtain
the
right
to
appeal
about
if
the
decisions
were
against
it,
etcetera.
this
is
something
that's
rather
tricky
and
rather
difficult
even
if
the
united
states
wanted
to
go
in
even
if
congress
appropriated
all
the
money
so
that
we
could
go
in
and
hire
the
requisite
attorneys
to
be
present
in
all
these
states
to
appear
in
these
proceedings.
second
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
the
question
of
new
york
law
as
i
explained
for
the
majority
decline
to
decide
it.
and
what
i
take
it
respondent
is
saying
is
that
even
if
there
were
a
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
directly
contrary
to
its
position
which
had
not
been
cited
by
any
party
to
the
new
york
supreme
court.
and
the
reason
it
had
not
been
cited
is
because
nobody
was
presenting
that
position
but
that
that
they
had
gone
in
there
and
wait
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
i
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
that's
certainly
not
--
not
the
decision
stated
by
the
parties,
detectors,
and
either
these
cases
in
their
briefs.
mr.
jack
s.levin
their
position
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
their
position
and
the
position
of
the
third
circuit
and
of
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
is
that
a
decision
of
the
state
lower
court,
the
state
probate
or
trial
court
is
final
and
binding.
not
that
there's
an
exception
if
you
can
find
a
state
decision
of
another
court
that
goes
the
other
way.
final
and
binding,
and
that's
the
end
even
if
it's
adversary
and
even
if
it's
clearly
wrong.
that's
their
position
as
i
understand
it.
and
a
very
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
the
decision
as
to
--
mr.
jack
s.levin
which
question,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
s.levin
well
we
did
not
ask
this
court
to
decide
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
didn't
think
that
was
a
relevant
question
to
bring
before
this
court.
especially
because
the
new
york
legislature
has
now
overruled
the
instant
decision
by
a
statute
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
so
that
it's
a
question
of
no
continuing
importance
to
the
particular
new
york
question.
but
it's
the
sort
of
thing
that
comes
up
all
the
time.
if
this
court
adopts
our
view,
then
it
can
remand
the
case
to
the
federal
court
of
appeals
to
pass
for
the
first
time
on
the
question
of
new
york
law.
we
believe
that
we're
clearly
correct
if
it
ever
reaches
the
question
of
new
york
laws,
judge
friendly
points
out.
mr.
jack
s.levin
well,
i
think
that
this
court
may
well
decide
that
question.
i
don't
whether
it's
a
--
we
should
ask
you
