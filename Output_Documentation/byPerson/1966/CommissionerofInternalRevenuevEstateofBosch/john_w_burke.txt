mr.
john
w.
burke
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
proceedings
below
were
not
adversary
proceedings.
now,
i
think
it
is
a
fair
statement
by
judge
friendly
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
state
court
proceeding
was
to
effect
estate
taxation.
but
let
us
examine
the
situation
in
which
the
trustee
found
itself
when
its
counsel
suggested
to
it
that
the
release,
purported
release
of
the
power
of
appointment
by
the
wife,
may
not
have
been
valid.
it
sounded
very
patriotic
thing
i
suppose
for
trustee
to
give
up
the
assets
of
the
estate
to
the
federal
government,
but
it's
unlawful
for
their
standpoint.
and
no
matter
having
been
called
to
his
attention,
he
had
to
have
a
resolution
of
it.
he
sought
this
--
he
sought
this
resolution
by
an
action
or
an
accounting.
that
action
was
pending
when
the
tax
court
proceedings
was
pending.
the
tax
court
granted
a
stay
of
the
tax
court
proceedings
pending
the
outcome
of
this
state
court
proceeding
which
was
to
be
determined
at
due
of
the
property
rights
involved
in
the
estate
tax
proceeding.
but
there's
no
way
of
vouching
the
commissioner
and
has
been
suggested
a
commissioner
20
years
ago
said
that
he
would
not
participate
in
any
proceedings
even
to
protect
this
on
the
federal
fist.
and
i
heard
the
argument
before
this
case
in
which
he
didn't
want
to
come
in
to
protect
one
million
dollars
in
taxes,
i
thought
that
perhaps
he
could
afford
to
employ
lawyers
but
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
suggest
that
i'm
better
than
administrator
than
he.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
issue
in
the
state
court,
he
should
have
taken
advantage
of
it.
now,
in
the
state
court
proceeding,
there
was
no
arrangement
between
the
judge
and
the
trustee
as
has
been
suggested
not
in
our
case
but
in
possibly
other
cases.
the
matter
was
submitted
to
him
for
his
--
the
court's
independent
determination
upon
briefs
or
be
it
all
supporting
the
same
proposition.
the
trustee
couldn't
find
another
adversary
to
make
this
an
adversary
proceeding
if
he
wanted
to.
there
wasn't
anybody
who
would
contest
the
issue
even
the
guardian
ad
litem
for
the
infant.
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
the
release
was
valid
or
invalid
because
if
it
was
valid,
the
wife
had
a
special
power
of
appointment
that
he
could
have
appointed
to
the
infant.
if
the
general
power
of
appointment,
it
was
the
same
thing
as
far
as
the
guardian
ad
litem
was
concerned.
if
she
didn't
exercise
either
power,
his
word
had
rights.
i
address
myself
to
the
policy
of
the
proposed
rule.
that
is,
that
there
be
a
recognition
of
all
adversary
judgments
and
the
declamation
to
recognize
any
nonadversary
situations.
i
don't
know
just
where
the
dichotomy
lies
but
in
cases
i
concede
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
commissioner
should
not
be
bound
by
what
is
it
in
effect.
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
rubberstamped
by
the
court,
i
doubt
that
there
are
many
although,
there
may
be
some.
i
doubt
that
a
judge
of
a
state
court
for
example,
having
in
mind
property
rights
which
maybe
of
--
may
affect
his
own
state's
ability
to
tax
would
blindly
be
hood-wigged
into
a
decision
for
the
accommodation
of
the
parties.
when
does
a
matter
become
adversary?
who's
going
to
judge
when
it
is
an
adversary
proceeding?
and
there
are
varying
degrees
of
abilities
in
advocates?
is
the
federal
court
going
to
look
to
the
competence
of
the
litigation
as
conducted
by
an
advocate?
is
he
going
to
look
to
the
briefs
to
see
whether
a
case
was
cited
which
might
be
determined
at
it?
is
he
going
to
hold
the
trial
of
the
issue
of
adversariness
if
i
may
invent
a
word?
at
what
degrees,
at
what
point,
what
standards
are,
what
norms
are
there
to
guide
the
federal
judge
in
determining
when
a
judgment
regularly
obtained
is
presented
to
him
which
determines
property
rights?
is
he
going
to
apply
the
erie
rule
and
look
into
what
the
highest
court
of
the
state
should
or
would
have
settled
on
the
matter
of
these
property
rights?
he
comes
--
he
has
a
much
easier
task
if
he
may
look
at
the
published
decisions,
if
he
may
conclude
that
the
property
rights
of
the
parties
have
been
fixed
thereby
excluding
any
necessity
for
the
application
of
the
erie
doctrine.
that
i
suggest
is
a
much
easier
rule.
on
our
case
in
the
state
court,
this
question
was
submitted
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
if
there
is
any
evidence
of
fraud,
i
say
that
the
district
judge
in
the
competent
federal
controversy
involving
taxation
should
ignore
the
judgment
just
as
to
any
other
party
might
ignore
it.
but
beyond
that,
i
don't
think
the
federal
district
judge
should
be
required
to
go.
in
our
instance
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
would
exclude
all
consent
judgments.
if
the
federal
judge
is
presented
only
with
a
consent
judgment,
i
would
ignore
it
because
a
consent
judgment
is
in
effect,
an
agreement
among
the
parties
and
the
parties
should
not
be
permitted
to
agree
in
a
manner
in
which
the
federal
fisc
would
be
affected.
but
i
say
that
is
a
simpler
and
fairer
rule
for
the
judge
to
look
at
the
judgment
that
has
determined
absent
fraud.
in
our
instance,
this
question
was
presented
to
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
is
the
highest
court
at
the
origin
of
jurisdiction.
it
was
brief
as
i've
said
that
not
only
one
side,
but
the
judge
made
an
independent
consideration
of
the
facts
as
presented.
by
they
way,
there
were
no,
there
were
no
--
there
was
no
conflict
among
in
the
facts,
the
facts
were
stipulated.
they
were
stipulated
in
the
tax
court
and
the
same
stipulation
was
presented
to
the
justice
of
the
state
court.
he
rendered
a
recent
opinion
which
was
published
--
which
has
precedential
value.
other
lawyers,
if
the
question
ever
arises
as
the
construction
of
183
of
the
real
property
law,
the
first
thing
the
judge
or
the
lawyer
will
look
to
is
this
opinion,
the
only
one
in
point
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
my
adversary
said
that
there
were
other
decisions
that
should
have
been
presented
to
the
judge,
none
of
them
was
in
point.
each
of
them
involved
a
release
of
a
power
of
appointment
which
had
already
vested
by
reason
of
the
death
of
the
donor
of
the
power,
and
was
exercisable
by
deed.
it
was
in
effect
the
property
of
the
donee
of
the
power
of
appointment,
and
to
do
what
you
please
with
your
own
property.
here
there
was
an
illusory
grant
by
the
husband
to
the
wife
of
a
general
power
of
appointment.
she
couldn't
exercise
it
until
his
death.
and
she
couldn't
exercise
it
by
deed
but
only
by
will.
she
had
in
effect
nothing
to
release.
now,
i
heard
it
said
here
that
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
justice
was
erroneous.
who's
going
to
say
it
was
erroneous?
i
have
my
opinion,
anybody
else
can
have
his.
but
it
is
i
can
just
review
what
the
statute
was,
is
or
was
i
should
say
because
of
an
amendment
to
accommodate
the
situation
such
as
this.
the
statute
said
that
every
power
of
appointment
which
is
exercisable
by
will,
by
deed,
or
by
deed
and
will
may
be
released.
but
as
i've
just
indicated
to
the
court,
this
wife
had
nothing
but
an
illusory
grant
of
power.
and
the
judge
i
think
properly
gave
effect
to
the
term
exercisable.
it
has
a
meaning,
a
distinctive
meaning
in
the
law
of
trusts.
a
trust
for
example
which
creates
a
--
or
a
donor
who
creates
a
trust
and
grants
to
the
donee
of
the
power,
the
power
presently
to
appoint
to
himself,
his
creditors,
his
estate,
or
the
creditors
whose
estate,
is
an
exercisable
power
which
conveys
the
theme.
exercisable
means
a
great
deal
of
that
context
and
creditors
can
reach
the
property.
i
say
that
the
law
of
state
of
new
york
has
been
authoritatively
fixed
and
settled
by
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
that
it
should
be
followed
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
suggest
that
your
honor,
a
person
with
such
an
interest
in
a
million
dollars
should
be
vouched
in
or
should
be
allowed
to
come
in
to
present
his
views.
mr.
john
w.
burke
it
has
been
traditional
in
our
system
of
government
to
have
property
rights
determine
of
the
state
jurisdiction.
and
it's
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
well,
i
suggest
your
honor
that
in
cases
of
this
import
like
the
case
of
the
preceding
one,
the
commissioner
should
come
in
and
assert
this
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
it
doesn't
--
no
law
requires
but
no
law
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
--
forbids
it.
mr.
john
w.
burke
he
is
as
my
adversary
said
in
the
third
circuit,
the
government
comes
in
and
defends
--
and
litigates
these
issues
of
state
law.
the
reason
being
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
has
laid
down
the
rule
that
that
the
courts
--
districts
courts
are
found
in
a
federal
controversy
by
determinations
absent
fraud
by
a
state
court.
mr.
john
w.
burke
well
would
--
i
don't
know
if
anything
that
would
prevent
the
commissioner
have
been
doing
it
otherwise
he
wouldn't
be
there.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
it
will
sue
for
taxes
only
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
john
w.
burke
because
the
government
should
be
in
control
of
its
own
fisc
in
respect
of
the
taxability
of
something
in
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
determination
of
state
laws,
our
government
has
been
very
willing
to
accept
determination
of
some
state
of
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
that's
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
well
that's
our
situation,
your
honor.
there
was
no
question
involved
in
the
state
court
proceeding
of
federal
estate
tax
law.
the
only
thing
determined
there
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
your
honor,
if
it
involves
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute,
the
--
the
state
court
has
no
powers
whatever.
that
construction
must
be
by
a
federal
court.
but
here,
there's
no
question
of
the
construction
of
the
federal
statute.
it
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
--
as
i
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
well
i
can
think
of
a
situation
suggested
by
mr.
justice
fortas
that
our
fisc
could
be
controlled
at
a
measure
by
a
mexican
judgment.
according
to
my
recollection
even
a
unilateral
divorce
decree
obtained
in
mexico
permitted
the
husband
to
deduct
what
he
paid
to
his
wife
and
require
the
wife
to
pay
what
she
received.
now
that
affects
the
federal
fisc
of
foreign
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
w.
burke
the
commissioner
of
our
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
no
sir,
it
was
a
divorce
suit.
mr.
john
w.
burke
but
the
government
could
have
inquired
into
whether
this
was
adversary
or
nonadversary
and
made
its
regulation
depending
upon
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
but
if
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
well,
if
i
had
a
million
dollars
at
stake,
i'd
be
there
somehow.
mr.
john
w.
burke
but
the
--
if
the
government
were
a
party,
it
would
have
all
the
rights
of
appeal
right
up
to
this
court
perhaps.
i
don't
understand
why
it
shouldn't
be
there.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
all
i
can
ask
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
all
i
can
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor
is
that
the
commissioner
does
just
that
all
the
property
does
that
on
the
third
circuit.
now
who
am
i
to
say
they're
acting
illegally?
mr.
john
w.
burke
oh
yes.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
can
give
you
no
answer
except
what
i
--
a
tip
that
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
that's
not
our
case,
your
honor
mr.
john
w.
burke
well
i'm
--
i
cannot
say
the
case
just
before
me
but
i
know
that
in
this
case,
the
question
of
property
rights
was
submitted
for
the
independent
determination
of
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
new
york.
and
if
it
had
determined
that
question
adversely
to
the
--
to
the
respondent
here,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
john
w.
burke
well,
i
hesitate
to
suggest
that
it's
a
constitutional
question
that
would
involve
the
due
process
and
the
confiscation
of
property.
i
haven't
brief
it.
i
just
pondered
it
so
i
can't
give
you
a
very
good
answer.
mr.
john
w.
burke
no
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
seriously
doubt
it.
mr.
john
w.
burke
but
for
mo
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
since
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
been
made
in
the
construction
of
the
statute,
and
there
was
no
higher
court
decision,
the
inclination
would
be
to
follow
the
only
state
court
decision.
but
if
they
were
court
of
appeals'
decision,
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
--
there'll
be
an
opposite
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
agree.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
don't
think
you
can
drag
the
federal
government
in
against
its
will.
but
i
did
pick
up
the
suggestion
but
what
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes,
i
think
that
is
the
law.
mr.
john
w.
burke
certainly
not,
your
honor,
directly.
mr.
john
w.
burke
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
proceedings
below
were
not
adversary
proceedings.
now,
i
think
it
is
a
fair
statement
by
judge
friendly
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
state
court
proceeding
was
to
effect
estate
taxation.
but
let
us
examine
the
situation
in
which
the
trustee
found
itself
when
its
counsel
suggested
to
it
that
the
release,
purported
release
of
the
power
of
appointment
by
the
wife,
may
not
have
been
valid.
it
sounded
very
patriotic
thing
i
suppose
for
trustee
to
give
up
the
assets
of
the
estate
to
the
federal
government,
but
it's
unlawful
for
their
standpoint.
and
no
matter
having
been
called
to
his
attention,
he
had
to
have
a
resolution
of
it.
he
sought
this
--
he
sought
this
resolution
by
an
action
or
an
accounting.
that
action
was
pending
when
the
tax
court
proceedings
was
pending.
the
tax
court
granted
a
stay
of
the
tax
court
proceedings
pending
the
outcome
of
this
state
court
proceeding
which
was
to
be
determined
at
due
of
the
property
rights
involved
in
the
estate
tax
proceeding.
but
there's
no
way
of
vouching
the
commissioner
and
has
been
suggested
a
commissioner
20
years
ago
said
that
he
would
not
participate
in
any
proceedings
even
to
protect
this
on
the
federal
fist.
and
i
heard
the
argument
before
this
case
in
which
he
didn't
want
to
come
in
to
protect
one
million
dollars
in
taxes,
i
thought
that
perhaps
he
could
afford
to
employ
lawyers
but
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
suggest
that
i'm
better
than
administrator
than
he.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
issue
in
the
state
court,
he
should
have
taken
advantage
of
it.
now,
in
the
state
court
proceeding,
there
was
no
arrangement
between
the
judge
and
the
trustee
as
has
been
suggested
not
in
our
case
but
in
possibly
other
cases.
the
matter
was
submitted
to
him
for
his
--
the
court's
independent
determination
upon
briefs
or
be
it
all
supporting
the
same
proposition.
the
trustee
couldn't
find
another
adversary
to
make
this
an
adversary
proceeding
if
he
wanted
to.
there
wasn't
anybody
who
would
contest
the
issue
even
the
guardian
ad
litem
for
the
infant.
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
the
release
was
valid
or
invalid
because
if
it
was
valid,
the
wife
had
a
special
power
of
appointment
that
he
could
have
appointed
to
the
infant.
if
the
general
power
of
appointment,
it
was
the
same
thing
as
far
as
the
guardian
ad
litem
was
concerned.
if
she
didn't
exercise
either
power,
his
word
had
rights.
i
address
myself
to
the
policy
of
the
proposed
rule.
that
is,
that
there
be
a
recognition
of
all
adversary
judgments
and
the
declamation
to
recognize
any
nonadversary
situations.
i
don't
know
just
where
the
dichotomy
lies
but
in
cases
i
concede
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
commissioner
should
not
be
bound
by
what
is
it
in
effect.
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
rubberstamped
by
the
court,
i
doubt
that
there
are
many
although,
there
may
be
some.
i
doubt
that
a
judge
of
a
state
court
for
example,
having
in
mind
property
rights
which
maybe
of
--
may
affect
his
own
state's
ability
to
tax
would
blindly
be
hood-wigged
into
a
decision
for
the
accommodation
of
the
parties.
when
does
a
matter
become
adversary?
who's
going
to
judge
when
it
is
an
adversary
proceeding?
and
there
are
varying
degrees
of
abilities
in
advocates?
is
the
federal
court
going
to
look
to
the
competence
of
the
litigation
as
conducted
by
an
advocate?
is
he
going
to
look
to
the
briefs
to
see
whether
a
case
was
cited
which
might
be
determined
at
it?
is
he
going
to
hold
the
trial
of
the
issue
of
adversariness
if
i
may
invent
a
word?
at
what
degrees,
at
what
point,
what
standards
are,
what
norms
are
there
to
guide
the
federal
judge
in
determining
when
a
judgment
regularly
obtained
is
presented
to
him
which
determines
property
rights?
is
he
going
to
apply
the
erie
rule
and
look
into
what
the
highest
court
of
the
state
should
or
would
have
settled
on
the
matter
of
these
property
rights?
he
comes
--
he
has
a
much
easier
task
if
he
may
look
at
the
published
decisions,
if
he
may
conclude
that
the
property
rights
of
the
parties
have
been
fixed
thereby
excluding
any
necessity
for
the
application
of
the
erie
doctrine.
that
i
suggest
is
a
much
easier
rule.
on
our
case
in
the
state
court,
this
question
was
submitted
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
if
there
is
any
evidence
of
fraud,
i
say
that
the
district
judge
in
the
competent
federal
controversy
involving
taxation
should
ignore
the
judgment
just
as
to
any
other
party
might
ignore
it.
but
beyond
that,
i
don't
think
the
federal
district
judge
should
be
required
to
go.
in
our
instance
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
would
exclude
all
consent
judgments.
if
the
federal
judge
is
presented
only
with
a
consent
judgment,
i
would
ignore
it
because
a
consent
judgment
is
in
effect,
an
agreement
among
the
parties
and
the
parties
should
not
be
permitted
to
agree
in
a
manner
in
which
the
federal
fisc
would
be
affected.
but
i
say
that
is
a
simpler
and
fairer
rule
for
the
judge
to
look
at
the
judgment
that
has
determined
absent
fraud.
in
our
instance,
this
question
was
presented
to
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
is
the
highest
court
at
the
origin
of
jurisdiction.
it
was
brief
as
i've
said
that
not
only
one
side,
but
the
judge
made
an
independent
consideration
of
the
facts
as
presented.
by
they
way,
there
were
no,
there
were
no
--
there
was
no
conflict
among
in
the
facts,
the
facts
were
stipulated.
they
were
stipulated
in
the
tax
court
and
the
same
stipulation
was
presented
to
the
justice
of
the
state
court.
he
rendered
a
recent
opinion
which
was
published
--
which
has
precedential
value.
other
lawyers,
if
the
question
ever
arises
as
the
construction
of
183
of
the
real
property
law,
the
first
thing
the
judge
or
the
lawyer
will
look
to
is
this
opinion,
the
only
one
in
point
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
my
adversary
said
that
there
were
other
decisions
that
should
have
been
presented
to
the
judge,
none
of
them
was
in
point.
each
of
them
involved
a
release
of
a
power
of
appointment
which
had
already
vested
by
reason
of
the
death
of
the
donor
of
the
power,
and
was
exercisable
by
deed.
it
was
in
effect
the
property
of
the
donee
of
the
power
of
appointment,
and
to
do
what
you
please
with
your
own
property.
here
there
was
an
illusory
grant
by
the
husband
to
the
wife
of
a
general
power
of
appointment.
she
couldn't
exercise
it
until
his
death.
and
she
couldn't
exercise
it
by
deed
but
only
by
will.
she
had
in
effect
nothing
to
release.
now,
i
heard
it
said
here
that
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
justice
was
erroneous.
who's
going
to
say
it
was
erroneous?
i
have
my
opinion,
anybody
else
can
have
his.
but
it
is
i
can
just
review
what
the
statute
was,
is
or
was
i
should
say
because
of
an
amendment
to
accommodate
the
situation
such
as
this.
the
statute
said
that
every
power
of
appointment
which
is
exercisable
by
will,
by
deed,
or
by
deed
and
will
may
be
released.
but
as
i've
just
indicated
to
the
court,
this
wife
had
nothing
but
an
illusory
grant
of
power.
and
the
judge
i
think
properly
gave
effect
to
the
term
exercisable.
it
has
a
meaning,
a
distinctive
meaning
in
the
law
of
trusts.
a
trust
for
example
which
creates
a
--
or
a
donor
who
creates
a
trust
and
grants
to
the
donee
of
the
power,
the
power
presently
to
appoint
to
himself,
his
creditors,
his
estate,
or
the
creditors
whose
estate,
is
an
exercisable
power
which
conveys
the
theme.
exercisable
means
a
great
deal
of
that
context
and
creditors
can
reach
the
property.
i
say
that
the
law
of
state
of
new
york
has
been
authoritatively
fixed
and
settled
by
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
that
it
should
be
followed
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
suggest
that
your
honor,
a
person
with
such
an
interest
in
a
million
dollars
should
be
vouched
in
or
should
be
allowed
to
come
in
to
present
his
views.
mr.
john
w.
burke
it
has
been
traditional
in
our
system
of
government
to
have
property
rights
determine
of
the
state
jurisdiction.
and
it's
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
well,
i
suggest
your
honor
that
in
cases
of
this
import
like
the
case
of
the
preceding
one,
the
commissioner
should
come
in
and
assert
this
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
it
doesn't
--
no
law
requires
but
no
law
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
--
forbids
it.
mr.
john
w.
burke
he
is
as
my
adversary
said
in
the
third
circuit,
the
government
comes
in
and
defends
--
and
litigates
these
issues
of
state
law.
the
reason
being
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
has
laid
down
the
rule
that
that
the
courts
--
districts
courts
are
found
in
a
federal
controversy
by
determinations
absent
fraud
by
a
state
court.
mr.
john
w.
burke
well
would
--
i
don't
know
if
anything
that
would
prevent
the
commissioner
have
been
doing
it
otherwise
he
wouldn't
be
there.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
it
will
sue
for
taxes
only
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
john
w.
burke
because
the
government
should
be
in
control
of
its
own
fisc
in
respect
of
the
taxability
of
something
in
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
determination
of
state
laws,
our
government
has
been
very
willing
to
accept
determination
of
some
state
of
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
that's
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
well
that's
our
situation,
your
honor.
there
was
no
question
involved
in
the
state
court
proceeding
of
federal
estate
tax
law.
the
only
thing
determined
there
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
your
honor,
if
it
involves
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute,
the
--
the
state
court
has
no
powers
whatever.
that
construction
must
be
by
a
federal
court.
but
here,
there's
no
question
of
the
construction
of
the
federal
statute.
it
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
--
as
i
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
well
i
can
think
of
a
situation
suggested
by
mr.
justice
fortas
that
our
fisc
could
be
controlled
at
a
measure
by
a
mexican
judgment.
according
to
my
recollection
even
a
unilateral
divorce
decree
obtained
in
mexico
permitted
the
husband
to
deduct
what
he
paid
to
his
wife
and
require
the
wife
to
pay
what
she
received.
now
that
affects
the
federal
fisc
of
foreign
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
w.
burke
the
commissioner
of
our
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
no
sir,
it
was
a
divorce
suit.
mr.
john
w.
burke
but
the
government
could
have
inquired
into
whether
this
was
adversary
or
nonadversary
and
made
its
regulation
depending
upon
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
but
if
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
well,
if
i
had
a
million
dollars
at
stake,
i'd
be
there
somehow.
mr.
john
w.
burke
but
the
--
if
the
government
were
a
party,
it
would
have
all
the
rights
of
appeal
right
up
to
this
court
perhaps.
i
don't
understand
why
it
shouldn't
be
there.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
all
i
can
ask
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
all
i
can
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor
is
that
the
commissioner
does
just
that
all
the
property
does
that
on
the
third
circuit.
now
who
am
i
to
say
they're
acting
illegally?
mr.
john
w.
burke
oh
yes.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
can
give
you
no
answer
except
what
i
--
a
tip
that
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
that's
not
our
case,
your
honor
mr.
john
w.
burke
well
i'm
--
i
cannot
say
the
case
just
before
me
but
i
know
that
in
this
case,
the
question
of
property
rights
was
submitted
for
the
independent
determination
of
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
new
york.
and
if
it
had
determined
that
question
adversely
to
the
--
to
the
respondent
here,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
john
w.
burke
well,
i
hesitate
to
suggest
that
it's
a
constitutional
question
that
would
involve
the
due
process
and
the
confiscation
of
property.
i
haven't
brief
it.
i
just
pondered
it
so
i
can't
give
you
a
very
good
answer.
mr.
john
w.
burke
no
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
seriously
doubt
it.
mr.
john
w.
burke
but
for
mo
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
since
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
been
made
in
the
construction
of
the
statute,
and
there
was
no
higher
court
decision,
the
inclination
would
be
to
follow
the
only
state
court
decision.
but
if
they
were
court
of
appeals'
decision,
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
--
there'll
be
an
opposite
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes.
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
agree.
mr.
john
w.
burke
i
don't
think
you
can
drag
the
federal
government
in
against
its
will.
but
i
did
pick
up
the
suggestion
but
what
--
mr.
john
w.
burke
yes,
i
think
that
is
the
law.
mr.
john
w.
burke
certainly
not,
your
honor,
directly.
