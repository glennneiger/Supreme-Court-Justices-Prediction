justice
potter
stewart
he
certainly
had
the
general
problem
in
mind
when
he
wrote
the
codicil.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
codicil
was
obviously
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
residuary
bequest
to
the
widow,
the
benefit
of
the
marital
deduction
generally,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
giving
her
general
power?
justice
potter
stewart
for
its
right.
justice
potter
stewart
not
if
it's
true.
i
think
he
concedes
that
there
may
be
degrees
which
are
not
binding
if
they're
truly
collusive
or
fraudulent?
justice
potter
stewart
that
if
that
--
well
alright.
i
just
decide
to
have
a
little
bit.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
purpose
of
all
this
third
greater
that
it
take
insofar
as
the
issues
in
this
case
are
concerned?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
i
know
but
the
--
there
are
two
issues
here,
two
questions,
was
the
connecticut
probate
court
correct
as
a
matter
of
connecticut
law
and
(b),
whether
correct
or
incorrect
is
its
decree
binding?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what's
--
what's
--
those
are
the
issues
and
what's
that
going
to
do
with
either
one
of
those
issues?
justice
potter
stewart
your
position
that
this
was
a
nonadversary
proceeding,
i
gather
from
what
you
have
kept
saying
during
the
arguments.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
--
you're
taking
quite
a
different
position
from
the
ones
taken
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
in
your
brief
--
i
thought
in
your
brief
you
made
very
clear
that
you
want
us
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
was
an
adversary
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
that,
but
i'm
talking
about
your
position
in
this
litigation.
justice
potter
stewart
so
well
now
--
so
in
other
words
you
think
it
say
it
remains
an
open
question.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
granted
some
prejudgment
and
didn't
have
--
have
a
full
hearing
on
this
subject.
it
remains
an
open
question
whether
or
not
this
was
an
adversary
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
asking
these
questions
not
be
--
not
to
be
technical
about
whether
what
your
position
is
and
whether
or
not
you've
changed
it.
but
i'm
asking
them
because
of
the
same
kind
of
--
the
same
purpose
as
i
think
my
brother
fortas
was
asking.
what
is
--
what
do
you
mean
by
an
adversary
proceeding?
does
there
have
to
be
a
family
fight
in
other
words?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that's
true
about
probate
courts
generally?
in
my
limited
experience,
i
contested
the
probate
proceeding
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
and
that
they
--
and
the
probate
court
devote
its
energy
and
its
experience
in
time
and
ability
to
the
administration
of
estate.
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
usually
there's
not
a
family
fight.
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
the
--
the
probate
court
decrees
are
binding
at
all
parties.
justice
potter
stewart
for
one-third
or
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
was
whether
you
can
make
a
partial
release
of
the
general
power
of
appointment
before
you
have
the
--
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
to
exercise
the
power.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
the
court
was
wrong
in
citing
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
new
york
court
was
wrong
in
deciding
that.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
not
the
surrogate's
court?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
to
determine
the
validity
of
this
partial
release.
justice
potter
stewart
the
tax
court
here
judge
raum
apparently
accepted
the
view
that
the
--
that
a
state
court
decision
is
always
binding
unless
it's
subject
to
collateral
attack
by
the
parties
themselves.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
he
summed
it
up
by
saying,
"we
contend
ourselves
here
with
following
the
general
rule
in
blair
against
the
commissioner."
and
earlier
in
his
opinion,
he
characterizes
blair
against
the
commissioner
as
standing
for
the
proposition
that
in
general
where
the
operation
of
the
federal
tax
law
turns
upon
a
nature
of
property
interest
created
under
state
law
and
adjudication
by
a
state
court
in
respect
to
the
very
property
interest
involved
is
final
where
that
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter,
and
the
proceeding
is
not
collusive.
and
he
says
that's
the
rule
i'm
going
to
accept
first.
justice
potter
stewart
he
certainly
had
the
general
problem
in
mind
when
he
wrote
the
codicil.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
codicil
was
obviously

that

--
justice
potter
stewart

justice
potter
stewart
for

justice
potter
stewart
not
if
it's
true.
i
think
he
concedes
that
there
may
be
degrees
which
are
not
binding
if
they're
truly
collusive
or
fraudulent?
justice

that
if
that

well

just

now,
what's

what's

those
are
the

and
what's
that
going
to
do
with
either
one
of
those
