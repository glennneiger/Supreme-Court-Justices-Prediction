justice
byron
r.
white
do
the
executors
take
the
position
on
them
when
they
petitioned
the
probate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
it's
erroneous?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
connecticut
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
agree,
i
suppose,
that
if
this
decision
had
been
appealed
and
had
been
affirmed
that
the
case
would
be
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
it
would
be
binding
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
purposes
of
this
tax
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
would
assume
you
would
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
would
say
it
is
a
matter
of
connecticut
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
if
it
had
been
an
adversary
proceeding
in
the
probate
court,
it
would
be
binding
in
this
case
or
should
be
held
binding.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
in
your
view
erroneous?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
correct.
now,
as
our
brief
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
do
you
think
that
--
i
take
it
your
position
in
the
lower
courts
was
the
erie
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
position
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
took?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
shouldn't
--
why
--
why
shouldn't
the
court
of
appeals
--
why
shouldn't
be
the
rule
be
the
same
that
the
tax
cases
as
other
cases
where
the
matter
is
to
be
governed
by
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
ordinary
diversity
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
erie
doctrine
also
applies
that
those
two
parties
attempted
to
get
the
question
settled
in
a
state
trial
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
doubt
that
these
parties
once
this
probate
decree
was
over
were
bound
by
at
themselves
in
the
sense
that
--
in
the
sense
that
the
grandchildren
were
going
to
get
$3
million
instead
of
$4
million?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
it
doesn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
it
doesn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
this
probate
court
doesn't
--
in
the
--
are
the
parties
precluded
by
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
--
is
there
any
way
that
the
grandchildren
--
let's
say
the
grandchildren
changed
their
minds
now
but
the
court
didn't,
is
there
anything
the
grandchildren
can
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
maybe
the
way
you
put
it.
but
the
court
is
construe
--
has
construed
connecticut
the
will
of
connecticut
law
and
everything
else
that
has
been
said
that
under
the
connecticut
law,
the
grandchildren
legally
are
entitled
only
$3
million.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
what
i
asked
you
--
i
just
asked
you
whether
--
whether
the
second
circuit
said
--
whatever
the
second
circuit
said
and
may
not
have
any
effect
or
whatsoever
on
this
--
these
probate
proceedings.
is
there
anything
the
grandchildren
can
do
to
get
more
out
of
this
estate
than
--
than
$3
million
other
than
to
ask
the
probate
court
reverse
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
who's
to
give
the
money
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
they
want
more
than
the
$3
million.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
does
it
make
any
difference
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
how
much
--
how
much
the
grandchildren
get,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
your
answer
is
that
the
grandchildren
as
a
result
of
this
decision
in
the
probate
court
is
going
to
get
$3
million
and
has
got
nothing
to
do
about
it
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
something
has
to
give
because
at
the
time
the
final
distribution
is
granted,
there's
not
going
to
be
$7
million
dollars
to
satisfy
the
probate
court's
formal
--
former
decree.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right
but
the
consequences
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
not
enough
money
to
satisfy
the
--
with
consequences
of
that
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
your
position,
is
it?
your
position
is
that
--
is
that
the
government
can
be
absent
and
still
be
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
burke,
i
suppose
that
the
congress
could
or
the
commissioner
could
if
such
is
permitted
him
to
determine
that
state
law
has
no
relevant
or
whatsoever
to
tax
decisions.
and
that
say
even
the
state
court
decisions
on
the
night
of
the
attorney
would
not
be
(voice
overlap)
could
not
be
final.
so
what
is
the
source
of
the
rule
in
that
these
cases
which
say
that
to
the
will
refer
to
the
state
law
to
determine
property
rights.
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
say
so
that
the
statute
said.
justice
byron

white
so
it
is
matter
of
--
it
really
is
the
matter
of
court
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
and
the
united
states
in
this
case
and
the
one
to
the
court
concede
that
it's
state
law
that
governs
the
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
really
the
question
is
when
and
under
what
circumstances
will
be
held
that
the
state
law
has
been
properly
ascertained.
