justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
levin,
there's
another
million
dollars
i
gather
has
to
be
paid
for
the
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
the
second
circuit
for
if
--
now
you
have
$4
million
--
$7
million
on
the
proration
statute
up
here,
the
black
gap
between
the
widow
and
their
grandchildren,
now
it's
going
to
be
only
$6
million.
now,
to
whom
does
the
extra
million
dollars
come?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
--
in
other
words
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
--
this
connecticut
decree
now
in
consequence
of
the
second
circuit
decree
is
now
revisable,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
think
that
in
your
position
certainly
isn't
trying
to
contribute
the
purpose
stating
federal
court
relationships
if
you
have
to
try
out
in
the
federal
court
whether
or
not
the
state
court
proceeding
was
a
proper
proceeding
had
led
to
a
judgment.
well,
i'm
amazed
you
just
don't
take
the
position.
it's
either
not
binding
at
all
as
i
gather
is
your
position
in
this
throughout
this
so-called
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
it
is
binding,
one
or
the
other.
the
reason
we
don't
take
that
position
outright
is
that
the
regulations
have
since
1919
in
one
area
and
19
--
since
1949,
a
year
after
the
enactment
of
the
marital
deduction
and
the
marital
deduction
have
indicated
that
the
commissioner
will
accept
the
bona
fide
adversary
dispute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
do
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
no
merit
in
my
suggestion
that
that
does
not
only
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
contribute
to
harmonious
federal
state
court
relationship,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
only
suggesting
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
decision
of
this
case,
i
would
think
it'd
be
preferable
either
to
say
that
the
revenue
is
bound
by
the
state
court
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
all
instances
or
that
the
revenue
is
never
bound
by
the
state
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
any
instance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
i'm
just
wondering
what
happened
if
the
government
gets
these
extra
million
dollars
and
what
happens
to
the
distribution
made
by
the
probate
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
that
it
will
come
out
of
them
so
that
they'll
now
get
$2
million
instead
of
$3
million,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
it.
so
they'll
now
get
$2
million
and
the
widow
will
get
$4
million,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
a
refund
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
and
that
--
if
you
get
--
if
you
--
if
you
prevail,
you
got
to
add
--
let's
get
back
to
either
widow's
share
or
the
children's
share
only
to
the
children's
share.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
any
en
banc
hearing
sought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
en
banc
hearing
sought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
suppose
mr.
burke
in
your
case
--
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
taken
the
view
as
it
did
if
in
fact
there
existed,
if
in
fact
there
were
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
contrary
to
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
we're
not
to
take
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
--
we're
not
to
take
the
language
which
in
effect
is
that
the
federal
courts
help
us
to
do
anything
about,
that's
concluded
by
what
the
supreme
court
did
in
the
proceeding
involved
in
this
very
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
i
take
it
if
there
were
absent
appellate
decision
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
was
contrary
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
the
result.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
i
didn't
get
that
impression
from
mr.
burke's
answer
to
my
question,
mr.
levin.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
he
says
the
matter
how
it
got
there,
if
in
fact
there
were
an
appellate
decision.
i've
known
the
appellate
decision
or
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
came
to
the
attention
of
the
federal
court
which
in
--
which
was
contrary
the
result
reached
by
the
supreme
court
judge
in
this
--
in
this
case.
but
he
did
not
think
that
he
should
be
or
that
the
go
--
the
federal
court
would
have
thought
it
was
included
by
what
happened
when
this
case
of
the
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
about
that
going,
he
answered
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
levin,
there's
another
million
dollars
i

has
to
be
