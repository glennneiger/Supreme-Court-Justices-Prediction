what
about
the
next
sentence?
what
about
the
next
sentence
on
312?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
greenberg,
what
–
do
you
think
that
statement
made
by
the
petitioner
through
the
[inaudible]
before
he
was
turned
over
to
the
police
custody,
is
relevant
to
the
confession
problem
or
the
jackson
v.
denno
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
a
confession
from
the
fact
and
the
admission
made
his
turpentine
workers.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
a
record
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
undisputed
really,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
greenberg,
without
a
reference
to
that,
just
talking
about
this
is
a
procedure
of
matter,
do
you
–
precisely
in
what
respects
did
the
judge
fail
to
follow
the
jackson
against
denno
procedure?
this
procedure
now
and
not
standards
applied?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
denied
the
motion.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
precisely
what
is
a
procedure
as
a
matter
of
fact
from
the
standards.
you
think
that
the
court
fail
--
is
the
fact
that
the
court
--
the
judge
merely
denied
this
and
didn't
make
any
findings?
is
that
what
you're
objecting
--?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
assuming
that
because
what
you
state
to
be
george
law,
but
as
i
think
what
brother
white
asked
a
little
while
ago,
there's
nothing
in
this
transcript
that
would
indicate
whether
the
--
that
the
judge
felt
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
showing
here
or
whether
you
found
that
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
justice
abe
fortas
it
could
be
a
really
different
one,
perhaps
i
really
–
justice
abe
fortas
what
hour
was
that
statement
of
the
[inaudible]
do
you
remember?
justice
abe
fortas
at
what
hour
did
he
make
the
statement
of
the
[inaudible]
--
justice
abe
fortas
he
didn't
quite
then
said
that,
did
he,
that
the
doctor
certainly
denied
that
he,
the
doctor
--
justice
abe
fortas
–
kicked
him,
but
he
did
not,
as
i
read
the
record,
he
did
not
deny
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
somebody
else
might
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
also
said
that
he
found
him
on
the
floor?
justice
abe
fortas
assaulted
and
kicked
him.
justice
abe
fortas
in
all
premise,
you
have
--
don't
you
have
to
say
that
the
only
thing
that
the
doctor
said
was
that
he
himself
didn't
kick
him
or
knock
him
down?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
doctor
was
telling
something
that
wasn't
true,
there
must
have
been
some
invisible
force
in
the
doctor's
office
that
tripped
up
the
petitioner
and
threw
him
to
the
floor,
that
sort
of
thing,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
sir,
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
would
say
so.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
greenberg,
what
do
you
make
of
this
testimony
with
respect
to
the
statement
on
monday
in
which
this
testimony
to
the
effect
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
make
of
it
on
the
jackson
and
denno
confession
point,
that
is
to
say
that
the
confession
was
given
on
saturday.
on
monday,
according
to
his
testimony,
the
petitioner
said
that
the
confession
was
true.
there's
no
contradiction
to
that
and
there
are
no
inflicting
testimony,
nothing
in
the
record
as
i
remember
it
except
of
this
testimony
of
officer
cornelius
that
there
was
--
that
he
read
the
written
statement
to
the
prisoner
on
monday
and
that
the
prisoner
said
--
confirmed
it.
justice
abe
fortas
what
effect
does
that
have
in
your
judgment
on
the
problem
of
voluntariness?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
this
occurred
a
week
after
the
written
statement
was
taken
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
there's
nothing
in
the
record
except
that
he
was
in
jail
and
then
a
week
later
an
officer
visits
him
in
jail
and
raised
the
statement
for
him
and
he
says,
“yes,
that's
right.
i
did
it”
and
i
suppose
those
were
the
facts,
what
about
them?
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
got
such
cases
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
similar
to
this?
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
the
next
sentence?
what
about
the
next
sentence
on
312?
