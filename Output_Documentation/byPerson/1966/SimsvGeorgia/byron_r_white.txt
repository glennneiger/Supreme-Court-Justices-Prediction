(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
we
must
skip
to
the
resolution
of
some
factual
matters
here
or
are
you
arguing
that
the
courts
below
failed
to
follow
any
procedure
which
jackson
has
supposedly
established
for
the
resolution
of
these
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
about
the
procedure?
are
you
going
to
talk
anymore
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
wondered
if
this
evidence
you're
talking
about
came
up
–
i
suppose
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
confessions
for
this
trial
--
justice
byron
r.
white
-–
by
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
petitioner
and
the
witnesses
for
the
state
testify
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judge
denied
most
of
this
threat.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
make
the
specific
timing
of
the
fact
but
he
ruled.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
so
far,
there's
nothing
wrong
and
there's
no
noncompliance
jackson
v.
denno?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let's
just
assume
that
you
took
the
same
rule
in
jackson
against
denno
and
pick
up
townsend
v.
sain,
when
you
have
a
ruling
you
might
assume
in
some
circumstances
that
is
some
reason
to
suspect
the
court
applies
the
right
standard.
there's
no
necessity
to
make
a
specific
findings.
is
there
some
evidence
here
and
i
take
it
you
say
that
there
is,
this
is
what
i
really
want
to
get
to.
what
is
the
standard
that
you
think
the
court
applied
and
that
you
say
the
court
applied
--
justice
byron
r.
white
-–
validate
this
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
refer
to
show
that
this
is
the
standard
to
be
applied
–
that
he
applied
in
the
facie
showing.
justice
byron
r.
white
jackson
against
denno
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
standards
–
it
had
to
do
with
the
procedures.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
something
to
do
with
what
the
law
was
–
that's
what
voluntariness
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
take
the
charge.
now,
what's
wrong
with
the
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
unexceptionable
so
far
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it's
not
complete
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
think
it
doesn't
go
far?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
is
it
bad?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
exclude.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
you
think
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
greenberg,
did
the
state
have
no
testimony
at
all
of
the
motion
to
suppress?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
that
jackson
v.
denno
[inaudible]
the
petitioner
said,
the
[inaudible]
but
in
georgia
law
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
there
was
no
state
evidence
--
no
state
evidence
on
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
but
i
don't
claim
the
[inaudible].
i
was
brutalized
but
not
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
and
here
is
what
happened
to
dr.
jackson,
[inaudible]
said
that
there
was
no
brutality
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
then
ruled
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
are
saying
whatever
happened
in
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
significant
only
at
the
time
[inaudible]
we
are
talking
about
now
jackson
v.
denno
and
what
the
judge
could
have
ruled
on
the
[inaudible]
he
haven't
heard
the
word
about
[inaudible].
i'm
just
wondering
on
how
to
[inaudible]
that
really
resolve
a
claim
that
i
could
rule
out
the
doctor's
office
and
therefore
my
confession
is
voluntary
[inaudible]
how
can
you
resolve
that
obligation
[inaudible]
you
have
only
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
recall
any
testimony
on
the
motion
to
suppress
any
thing
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
dr.
jackson
actually
testified
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
overruled?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
testimony
--
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
this
testimony
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
say
it
[inaudible]
prior
to
the
testimony
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
[inaudible]
do
you
think
he
could
say
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
say
whether
[inaudible]
or
not
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
were
--
you
were
[inaudible]
would
you
say
--
would
you
say
that
in
examining
this
case
and
deciding,
you
must
assume
and
accept
the
truth
of
the
petitioner's
allegations
as
to
what
happened
in
the
doctor's
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
accept
that?
do
we
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
at
least
of
georgia,
the
court
of
georgia
rule.
the
trial
judge,
since
there
was
no
contrary
evidence,
he
should
have
said,
“this
did
happen
in
the
doctor's
office
but”
--
justice
byron
r.
white
–
that
leaves
the
question
of
whether
it
was
[voice
overlap]
and
overall,
i
find
the
confession
voluntary.
justice
byron
r.
white
duress
to
follow
the
same
course.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
just
said
that
we
could
assume
that
the
--
what
happened
that
--
what
he
said
happened
at
the
doctor's
office
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
record
does
show
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
for
us
to
–
at
the
record
because
it
wouldn't
show
it.
we
therefore
have
to
go
on
the
basis
of
the
file,
do
we
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
we
would
have
another
hearing
to
supplement
that
because
somebody
may
not
believe
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
that's
in
the
record,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
testimony

they
asked
the

of
