mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
answer
one
or
two
questions
first
that
were
posed
and
then
present
my
remarks.
the
question
that
mr.
harlan,
justice
harlan
asked
yesterday
about
the
statistics,
those
statistics
were
not
put
in
the
record
but
they’re
all
found
at
page
29
of
the
brief
of
respondent.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
the
denial
by
dr.
jackson
that
he
kicked
or
that
he
struck
the
petitioner
is
found
at
pages
204
to
205
of
the
record
as
i
will
point
out
later,
there
was
no
denial
or
affirmation
of
the
other
part
of
the
charge
of
mistreatment
concerning
the
dragging
incident,
but
he
was
not
asked
either
on
direct
on
cross
about
that.
as
far
as
the
procedure
on
the
confession,
dr.
jackson
testified
first
and
that's
in
page
189
of
the
record.
he
was
called
by
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
testifying
to
the
condition
of
the
victim.
he
was
not
called
by
the
state
in
connection
with
any
confession
issue.
he
was
called
solely
to
testify
as
to
the
condition
of
the
victim
as
he
found
it
when
he
examined
him
and
also
to
identify
some
pictures
that
he
took
showing
her
condition.
the
question
of
what
happened
in
his
office
was
gotten
into
on
cross-examination
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
sheriff
lee
and
mr.
dudley
jones,
the
deputy
sheriff,
testified
later
in
the
case
and
on
the
question
of
the
confession
and
the
incriminating
admissions
at
pages
208
and
222
of
the
record,
they
had
previously
testified
to
substantially
the
same
thing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
confession
which
was
filed
prior
to
the
trial.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
with
regard
to
the
doctor,
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
the
letter
would
be
true
mr.
justice
white
for
this
reason,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
the
separation
as
to
time,
personnel
involved,
location,
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
himself
testified
under
oath
at
the
trial
that
he
was
not
scared
that
the
confession
was
read
to
him,
that
he
signed
it
because
it
was
right.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
which
that
is
our
position.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
what
happened
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
motion
to
suppress
was
filed
prior
to
trial.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
court
held
a
complete
hearing
on
that
before
whatever
struck
the
jury
or
put
the
person
in
jeopardy.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
started
out
to
be
--
it
started
out
to
be
and
then
counsel
for
petitioner
withdrew
his
request.
this
came
up
and
the
state
started
to
put
the
testimony
of
sheriff
lee
as
i
recall
at
this
point
and
the
counsel
for
petitioner
initially
objected
and
said,
well,
he
thinks
that
in
order
to
comply
with
jackson
versus
denno
that
another
complete
hearing
must
be
held
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
and
the
judge
started
to
do
that
and
then
he
said,
“no,
i
have
already
done
that
this
morning,
so
i
will
withdraw
that
request.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
of
course,
there
is
no
way
to
psychoanalyze
the
judge
at
this
time
but
our
position
is
that
the
decision
was
followed
as
i
hope
to
show
momentarily.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
alright
sir.
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
there
were
three
confessions
or
at
least
incriminating
admissions
involved
in
this
case.
the
first
was
a
testimony
of
author
lee
walker,
a
negro
laborer
to
the
effect
that
he
saw
the
petitioner
approximately
two
hours
after
the
crime
before
he
had
been
arrested
or
before
he
had
been
confronted
by
anyone
in
authority
at
which
time,
the
petitioner
spontaneously
stated
to
him
that
he
had
attacked
that
white
woman.
this
incriminating
admission
was
admitted
without
objection.
it's
not
challenged
here,
the
petitioner's
counsel
elicited
the
same
thing
on
the
cross-examination.
secondly,
there
was
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
was
an
answer
to
a
question
at
to
where
he'd
been
and
he
said,
he'd
been
playing
dice
somewhere
and
he
asked
him,
“did
you
attack
that
white
woman?”
he
said,
“yes,”
but
the
petitioner
himself
testified
at
the
trial
that
during
this
conversation
that
he
was
threatened
or
mistreated
anyway
when
this
confrontation
took
place
with
these
negro
employees.
the
second
was
the
written
confession
taken
at
worth
county
jail
at
approximately
10:30
p.m.
the
night
following
the
crime.
the
third
was
a
written
confession--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
was
around
three
to
three
--
somewhere
between
3:00
and
3:30
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
third
was
a
written
confession
that
was
taken
on
the
day
of
the
crime
was
read
to
the
petitioner
on
the
monday,
following
the
saturday
of
the
crime
when
he
was
arrested
by
agent
cornelius
of
the
gbi
at
which
time
the
petitioner
acknowledged
that
it
was
true.
a
motion
to
suppress
this
written
confession
was
filed
prior
to
trial.
all
of
the
evidence
relating
to
this
other
than
perhaps
dr.
jackson's
testimony
was
heard
at
this
time,
including
the
sworn
testimony
of
the
petitioner
himself.
the
same
substantial
of
the
same
evidence
was
abused
on
the
motion
to
suppress
that
later
went
in
before
the
jury
except
for
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
not
subjected
to
cross-examination
before
the
jury
because
he
did
not
elect
to
be
sworn.
he
made
an
unsworn
statement
and
the
state
on
the
however
unique
rule
of
the
unsworned
statement.
the
state
has
no
right
to
cross-examine
an
accused
on
his
unsworn
statement
and
in
fact,
if
the
state
had
made
a
motion
to
do
so
or
had
attempted
to
do
so,
the
presence
of
the
jury,
it
would
be
a
ground
for
mistrial.
we
have
a
combination
now.
some
of
us
hope
that
eventually
we'll
get
read
of
it
but
it
lingers
on.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
you
held
that
it
was
a
denial
of
counsel
for
the
judge
to
refuse
to
permit
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
he
has
right
to
take
a
stand
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
held
that
if
he
takes
the
stand
as
a
witness,
he
can
be
questioned
but
that
if
he
simply
elects
to
take
the
--
to
make
the
unsworn
statement,
he
can
be
--
things
can
be
suggested
but
he
is
not
entitle
to
questions
as
it
would
be
on
the
stand.
now,
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner
renewed
his
motion
to
exclude
this
confession.
it
was
admitted
with
respect
to
the
republication
of
the
written
confession
on
monday
following
the
offense.
the
counsel
for
petitioner
initially
objected
to
this
testimony
on
the
ground
that
the
proper
foundation
had
not
been
laid.
the
counsel
for
the
state
there
upon
proceeded
to
make,
to
lay
the
foundation
and
this
time,
the
testimony
was
admitted
without
objection
and
that's
at
page
239
of
the
record.
they
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
preserved
the
objection
to
the
original
written
confession
introduced
during
the
trial.
the
bill
of
exceptions
was
signed
overruling
the
motion
to
suppress
but
in
no
way
on
the
record,
is
there
any
challenge
against
the
--
what
i
refer
to
is
spontaneous
declaration
to
the
turpentine
workers
nor
to
the
republication
of
the
written
confession
on
the
monday
following.
the
written
confession
of
april
the
13th
is
attacked
primarily
on
the
ground
that
the
procedure
utilized
by
the
courts
below
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
jackson
versus
denno
in
providing
a
fair
hearing
in
which
both
the
underlying
factual
issues
and
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
should
be
determined.
the
first
response
that
we
make
to
this
is
that
such
a
hearing
was
held.
petitioner's
counsel
assisted
in
affording
it
by
filing
the
motion
to
suppress.
a
full
hearing
was
held,
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
under
oath,
the
testimony
of
the
two
officers
that
had
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
confession.
this
has
never
been
done
before
in
georgia
on
a
confession.
the
procedure
in
georgia
has
universally
been
for
an
opposite
to
take
the
stand,
and
the
court
to
swear
him,
for
the
counsel
for
the
state
to
ask
him,
“did
you
have
a
conversation
with
the
accused
concerning
him
whether
or
not
he
committed
the
crime?”
“yes.”
“before
he
--
you
had
this
conversation,
did
you
make
any
promises
to
him?
did
you
make
any
threats
or
hold
out
any
hope
of
reward
or
inducement?”
and
then
after
those
--
and
those
questions
or
--
were
pounded
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
jury
is
not
excluded
and
the
court
does
not
in
the
past
hear
all
of
the
evidence
relating
to
the
confession
but
only
the
foundation
questions
from
the
particular
witness
who
was
then
testifying.
so
this
was
a
distinct
departure
from
the
georgia
law,
a
procedure
that
had
been
hitherto
followed
in
our
state.
but
the
only
thing
as
i
see
it
which
the
trial
court
here
did
not
do
which
perhaps
it
should
have
or
could
have
done,
and
i
am
not
certain
in
reading
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
jackson
versus
denno,
as
well
as
boles
versus
stevenson
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
court,
for
the
trial
judge
to
read
into
the
record
an
explicit
finding
of
fact
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
that
was
not
done
here.
we
take
the
position
that
regardless
of
whether
it
was
or
it
wasn't
done
that
it's
harmless
because
in
view
that
we
take
of
the
evidence
relative
to
the
confession,
it
was
not
in
conflict
and
that
it
required
a
finding
of
voluntariness.
now
in
this
respect,
the
undisputed
evidence
shows
the
following.
the
offense
occurred
around
10
o'clock
in
the
morning,
saturday,
april
the
13th
on
a
country
road
near
st.
george
in
charlton
county.
following
the
assault,
the
accused
left
the
scene
of
the
crime,
his
car
wouldn't
run
and
he
walked
down
the
road
in
the
direction
toward
a
negro
settlement
referred
to
as
toledo.
about
2:00
or
3:00
p.m.
later
that
date,
these
two
negro
laborers
noticed
petitioner
upon
being
asked
whether
he
had
attacked
that
white
woman,
petitioner
replied
that
he
had.
this
statement
was
made
before
petitioner
had
ever
been
taken
into
custody,
before
he
had
been
confronted
by
anyone
in
authority.
as
petitioner
started
to
leave,
one
of
these
workers
effectuated
a
citizen's
arrest,
turned
him
over
to
a
mr.
stokes
around
3:30
who
in
turn
delivered
him
to
sgt.
sims
and
trooper
peacock.
these
officers
carried
petitioner
to
dr.
jackson's
office
in
folkston
for
the
purpose
of
examining
his
clothes
to
determine
the
presence
of
any
miniscule
strains
of
having
been
established
that
the
victim
was
in
the
last
days
of
the
month
of
period
at
the
time
of
the
assault.
petitioner
testified
while
he
--
while
he
was
at
the
doctor's
office,
the
doctor
knocked
him
down,
kicked
him
and
dragged
him
over
the
floor.
on
the
other
end,
dr.
jackson
denied
that
he
was
kicked
or
beaten.
there
was
no
questions
propounded
to
dr.
jackson
by
either
the
state
of
the
petitioner
as
--
or
as
a
dragging
is
concerned
–
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
he
said
he
was
not
present
at
all
times.
however
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
right,
but
the
petitioner
said
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
petitioner
said
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
i
might
state
this
also,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
petitioner
himself
testified
that
the
only
person
that
he
tried
to
tie
in
on
this
was
dr.
jackson.
he
did
not
at
any
time
say
any
police
officers
did
anything
wrong
to
him.
in
out
of
view
of
this,
this
court
has
in
a
number
of
decisions
held
at
--
with
the
mere
fact
that
at
some
previous
stage
of
a
prisoner's
arrest
or
incarceration
that
there
may
have
been
some
physical
abuse
that
that
does
not
invalidate
as
a
matter
of
law
any
confession
subsequently
obtained
and
in
fact,
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it
did
not.
the
stein
case
for
example
there
was
undisputed,
that
the
prisoners
did
have
some
marks
on
them
indicating
some
brutality,
but
the
stein
case
specifically
used
the
word
“concurrently
with”
so
we
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
at
one
point,
the
prisoner
may
have
been
involved
in
a
scuffle
does
not
certainly
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
petitioner
himself
admits
that
he
was
not
mistreated
in
the
jail,
that
these
officers
were
nice,
that
they
were
friendly,
that
they
are
--
statement
was
read
to
him,
that
he
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
--
contradictory
to
the
dragging
incident.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
under
the
rules
of
evidence
as
i
recall,
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
a
matter
to
which
there
is
no
evidence
in
conflict,
unless
the
petitioner's
testimony
is
impeached.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
would
be
my
evaluation.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct.
i
might
point
out
that
there's
no
evidence
whatever
that
the
petitioner
was
subjected
to
any
interrogation.
the
whole
context
and
atmosphere
of
this
incident
in
the
doctor's
office
was
not
related
to
confessions.
it
was
related
solely
to
examination
of
his
person
to
determine
the
presence
of
blood
on
his
clothes.
he
was
taken
from
there
approximately
30
miles
away.
he
was
turned
over
to
entirely
different
officers.
he
himself
did
not
say
that
any
officers
had
ever
mistreated
him.
and
all
the
mistreatment
allegations
that
he
makes
in
his
testimony
would
direct
you
to
a
dr.
jackson.
at
some
time
around
6:30
p.m.
after
he
had
been
in
the
jail
about
30
minutes
in
worth
county,
deputy
dudley
jones
happened
to
be
putting
a
prisoner
on
the
third
floor,
petitioner
recognizing
him
as
a
deputy
sheriff
that
he
had
known
previously
in
charlton
county,
called
him
and
inquired,
“mr.
dudley,
are
you
working
here?”
deputy
jones
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
asked
the
petitioner
through
the
bars
what
he
was
doing
there,
at
which
the
petitioner
replied
that
he
had
gotten
in
trouble
with
a
white
woman.
the
deputy
then
asked
him
if
he
wished
to
make
a
statement.
he
stated
that
he
would.
he'd
like
to
talk
to
the
sheriff.
at
the
trial,
petitioner
admitted
talking
to
deputy
jones
and
stated
that
he
was
treated
nice
and
that
no
effort
was
made
to
beat
him
or
to
say
anything
to
him,
that's
page
138-139.
about
10:30
that
same
night
after
sheriff
lee
had
come
to
the
jail,
petitioner
was
brought
downstairs
in
the
presence
of
mr.
jones
and
the
sheriff,
the
constable
and
the
chief
of
police,
the
statement,
a
written
confession
that
he's
primarily
attacked
in
this
case
was
taken.
now,
petitioner
testified
under
oath
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
as
i
say,
he
could
not
have
testified
to
these
facts
at
the
trial
because
the
state
did
not
have
the
right
to
examine
but
only
the
motion
to
suppress
he
testified
that
the
officers
talked
nice
to
him,
that
he
wasn't
beaten
or
threatened,
that
he
wasn't
afraid
of
deputy
jones.
he
was
friendly
to
him,
that
he
recalls
the
sheriff
telling
him
that
anything
he
said
could
be
used
against
him,
that
he
wasn't
scared,
that
the
statement
was
read
to
him
and
that
he
signed
it
because
it
was
right.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
testimony.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
fortas
had
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
knocked
down
or
something.
it's
also
undisputed
that
this
procedure
of
taking
this
statement
at
night
at
the
jail
took
not
more
than
15
to
30
minutes.
there
was
no
persistent
questioning,
there
was
no
protracted
questioning.
it
was
taken
on
the
same
day
that
he
was
arrested
approximately
seven
hours
after
his
arrest.
as
far
as
the
testimony
about
being
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
see
a
lawyer,
the
petitioner
did
not
deny
that.
he
said
that
he
could
not
recall
on
that
issue
one
way
or
another.
that's
at
page
137
and
140.
also,
contrary
to
the
brief,
what
he
said
in
the
brief
of
petitioner,
there
was
a
testimony
that
he
was
advised
that
he
did
not
have
to
make
a
statement
and
that's
at
page
104
of
the
record.
therefore,
what
we
have
is
this
that
the
petitioner
confessed
initially
after
having
been
in
jail
an
hour
or
so
or
at
least
it
was
incriminating
admission,
during
a
casual
conversation,
he
was
in
the
cell
and
the
officer
was
on
the
outside
which
he
called
to
the
officer
himself.
the
written
confession
was
given
approximately
four
hours
later.
interrogation
lasting
about
30
minutes
at
the
most.
in
his
own
testimony
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner
slipped
up
after
stating
that
the
sheriff
had
called
him
and
asked
him
about
signing
a
confession.
he
first
said
that
he
didn't
remember
signing
it
but
then
he
immediately
corrected
himself
and
said
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
signing,
that's
at
pages
135
and
page
248.
on
cross-examination,
he
admitted
that
the
statement
was
read
to
him
and
that
he
signed
it
because
it
was
right,
that's
on
page
141.
it's
not
the
slightest
evidence
that
we
submit
that
this
confessions
made
in
the
jail
were
anything
but
voluntary.
to
hold
otherwise
you
have
to
disregard
the
petitioner's
own
testimony.
so
therefore
we
say
that
even
assuming
arguendo
that
your
decision
in
jackson
does
require
that
the
trial
judge
make
an
explicit
statement
into
the
record
as
to
his
findings
of
fact
that
in
any
such
failure
here
was
harmless.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
which
colloquy
was
that
mr.
justice?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
was
after
dr.
jackson's
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
believe
that's
right
sir
because
as
i
recall
dr.
jackson
testified
first
and
i
believe
i
stated
that
in
reference
to
--
yes,
dr.
jackson
testified
first
in
page
189
and
the
objection,
the
colloquy
that
we
discussed
previously
came
up
in
connection
with
sheriff
lee's
testimony
which
begins
i
believe
at
222.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
i
think
out
of
the
abundance
of
caution,
he
wanted
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how's
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
sir,
he
withdrew
it
at
that
point.
we
further
submit
that
the
same
testimony
refutes
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
because
it
was
secured
by
the
coercive
circumstance.
now
the
fact
if
the
trial
judge
also
submitted
this
confession
to
the
jury,
does
invalidate
it
if
the
previous
determination
by
the
trial
judge
was
itself
sufficient.
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
held
perhaps
along
the
lines
of
the
--
by
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
in
jackson
that
the
issue
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
one
of
the
fact
issues
of
a
case
as
to
which
the
accused
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right
under
our
state
constitution
to
a
jury
trial.
under
the
georgia
law,
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
directed
verdict
of
guilt
to
a
permeable
case
and
we
have
a
statute
that
we
call
the
door
mat
that
strictly
prohibits
the
trial
judge
from
communing
in
extent
upon
what
has
or
has
not
been
proven.
consequently,
at
the
juncture
of
this
confession,
the
trial
judge
was
prohibited
either
from
failing
to
submit
it
to
the
jury
with
appropriate
instructions
or
else
from
spading
to
the
jury
his
opinion
is
to
what
he
had
found
and
this
is
where
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
got
[inaudible].
the
supreme
court
of
georgia's
decision,
page
338
of
the
record,
seems
to
and
what
i
consider,
i
hope
my
interpretation
is
correct
to
confuse
what
this
court
held
in
jackson
versus
denno.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
seems
to
be
saying
or
assuming
that
jackson
versus
denno
requires
that
the
trial
judge
advise
the
jury
of
his
independent
determination.
i
do
not
so
--
i
do
not
construe
jackson
versus
denno
to
do
that.
i
think
that
that's
necessarily
implied
in
the
opinion
insofar
as
you
expressly
approved
the
massachusetts
rule
under
which
the
issue
is
determined
by
both
the
judge
and
the
jury
and
that
is
what
we
submit
that
the
trial
judge
did
here.
of
course
whether
or
not
there
was
a
compliance
with
jackson
versus
denno,
is
a
federal
question
for
this
court
and
not
for
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
to
decide.
supreme
court
of
georgia
seem
to
assume
except
for
the
undisputed
evidence
aspect
of
it
that
would
not
have
been
in
compliance
with
jackson
versus
denno
except
for
these
three
factors
that
mr.
greenberg
touched
on
which
i
won't
not
deal
with.
that
brings
me
to
the
challenge
as
to
the
standards
that
were
used
to
determine
voluntariness.
the
charge
complaint
of
essentially
was
a
code
section
that's
been
the
law
of
georgia
many
years.
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
they
were
not
to
consider
the
confession
that
it
was
to
be
received
with
caution
that
a
confession
alone
uncorroborated
by
other
evidence
will
not
just
file
conviction.
to
make
a
confession
admissible,
it
must
have
been
made
freely
and
voluntarily
without
being
induced
by
the
slightest
hope
of
benefit
or
the
modus
fear
of
injury.
that
charge
if
anything
we
submit
is
more
complete
than
just
a
simple
test
of
voluntariness
that
this
court
enunciated
in
the
gallegos
versus
nebraska
decision.
we
submit
that
the
charge
did
not
limit
the
jury
to
considering
just
mere
direct
threats
and
open
promises.
the
court
--
this
court
has
not
yet
held
that
a
state
court
must
give
a
trial
jury,
a
resume
of
it's
holdings
and
all
of
the
factual
circumstances,
the
myriad
situations
that
ever
risen
and
tell
them
that
they
may
consider
all
of
that.
that
has
never
been
held
and
in
fact
you
held
just
to
the
contrary
in
lyons
versus
oklahoma
which
has
held
at
the
question
as
to
how
specific
a
charge
to
the
jury
on
an
issue
of
confession
must
be
primarily
a
question
for
the
state
courts.
rogers
versus
richmond,
that
does
not
hold
anything
to
the
contrary
and
simply
holds
it
where
it
is
seen
that
the
trial
judge
both
in
his
determination
and
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury,
considered
the
probable
reliability
of
the
confession
as
one
element
in
determining
it's
voluntariness
if
that
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
the
specific
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
brennan
about
the
implications
to
be
drawn
from
a
denial
of
the
overruling
of
the
motion
to
suppress
would
be
precluded
against
petitioner
in
the
culombe
case
at
367
u.s.
of
603
-
604
if
that
is
still
the
law.
we
next
wish
to
address
a
few
remarks
to
the
contention
as
far
as
escobedo
was
concerned.
we
think
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
escobedo.
here,
the
petitioner
was
expressly
told
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
lawyer
and
he
said
he
didn't
want
one.
he
testified
himself
at
the
trial
under
oath
that
he
remembers
the
sheriff
telling
him
that
anything
he
said
could
be
used
against
him
and
not
only
that
he
never
requested
a
counsel,
he
expressly
declined
it.
he
was
also
told
that
he
didn't
have
to
make
a
statement
as
i
previously
stated
and
that's
on
page
104.
the
evidence
does
show
that
he
had
only
a
third
grade
education
but
if
you
read
his
testimony
as
a
whole
other
than
you
get
to
the
places
where
the
manufactured
testimony
about
can
you
define
or
do
you
know
what
is
meant
by
constitutional
rights
about
being
advised
about
your
rights,
he
responded
very
well
to
the
questions.
he
handled
himself
in
a
perfect
manner
that
indicated
he
knew
what
is
going
on.
now
in
escobedo
of
course,
there
the
accused
requested
counsel
and
it
was
specifically
denied
and
following
that
a
confession
was
taken
that
is
not
to
this
case.
as
far
as
the
jury
selection
procedures,
we
think
that
the
evidence
shows
this
that
even
assuming
that
this
evidence
as
to
the
prior
jury
list
had
come
in
and
had
been
admitted
and
even
assuming
that
it
had
created
--
carried
the
burden
at
most
evidence
of
prior
jury
list
can
establish
as
a
prima
facie
case.
it
cannot
conclusively
establish
discrimination
as
to
this
particular
jury.
it
creates
a
prima
facie
case
shifting
the
burden
to
the
state
to
go
forward.
we
think
the
evidence
here
shows
that
there
had
been
a
revision
just
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
spring
of
1964.
there
was
one
negro
on
the
19
men
grand
jury.
there
were
nine
negroes
on
the
99
summoned
for
the
traverse
jury
and
at
least
four
of
these
nine
were
put
upon
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
he
so
alleges
at
page
321
in
his
amended
motion
for
new
trial
and
the
trial
judge
certified
that
which
thereby
established
that
as
a
fact
and
this
is
between
–
stated
that
only
three
were
put
upon
him
but
they
allege
in
their
motion
that
four
and
that's
been
approved.
georgia
law
as
we
will
deal
further
in
the
whitus
case,
i
do
not
oppose
to
argue
the
issue
about
the
tax
digest
in
this
case
because
the
same
thing
comes
up
in
the
whitus
case,
but
georgia
law
limits
jury
service
to
tax
payers.
in
this
respect,
the
negroes
constituted
20%
of
the
tax
payers
in
charlton
county
with
411
negroes
to
1548
white
people,
but
of
the
691
non-white
persons
in
charlton
county,
25
years
of
age
or
older,
302
were
functionally
illiterate
according
the
census
bureau.
we
think
that
the
negro
representation
on
the
jury
here
compares
favorably
with
that
it
was
upheld
in
swain
versus
alabama
and
brown
versus
allen
and
then
regardless
of
whether
the
trial
judge
did
or
not
err
in
excluding
this
evidence,
the
most
that
it
would
have
done
would
have
established
the
prima
facie
case
in
that
the
evidence
as
to
this
particular
box
--
that
we
submit,
overcame
in
such
a
prima
facie
showing.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
answer
one
or
two
questions
first
that
were
posed
and
then
present
my
remarks.
the
question
that
mr.
harlan,
justice
harlan
asked
yesterday
about
the
statistics,
those
statistics
were
not
put
in
the
record
but
they’re
all
found
at
page
29
of
the
brief
of
respondent.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
the
denial
by
dr.
jackson
that
he
kicked
or
that
he
struck
the
petitioner
is
found
at
pages
204
to
205
of
the
record
as
i
will
point
out
later,
there
was
no
denial
or
affirmation
of
the
other
part
of
the
charge
of
mistreatment
concerning
the
dragging
incident,
but
he
was
not
asked
either
on
direct
on
cross
about
that.
as
far
as
the
procedure
on
the
confession,
dr.
jackson
testified
first
and
that's
in
page
189
of
the
record.
he
was
called
by
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
testifying
to
the
condition
of
the
victim.
he
was
not
called
by
the
state
in
connection
with
any
confession
issue.
he
was
called
solely
to
testify
as
to
the
condition
of
the
victim
as
he
found
it
when
he
examined
him
and
also
to
identify
some
pictures
that
he
took
showing
her
condition.
the
question
of
what
happened
in
his
office
was
gotten
into
on
cross-examination
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
sheriff
lee
and
mr.
dudley
jones,
the
deputy
sheriff,
testified
later
in
the
case
and
on
the
question
of
the
confession
and
the
incriminating
admissions
at
pages
208
and
222
of
the
record,
they
had
previously
testified
to
substantially
the
same
thing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
confession
which
was
filed
prior
to
the
trial.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
with
regard
to
the
doctor,
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
the
letter
would
be
true
mr.
justice
white
for
this
reason,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
the
separation
as
to
time,
personnel
involved,
location,
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
himself
testified
under
oath
at
the
trial
that
he
was
not
scared
that
the
confession
was
read
to
him,
that
he
signed
it
because
it
was
right.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
which
that
is
our
position.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
what
happened
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
motion
to
suppress
was
filed
prior
to
trial.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
court
held
a
complete
hearing
on
that
before
whatever
struck
the
jury
or
put
the
person
in
jeopardy.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
started
out
to
be
--
it
started
out
to
be
and
then
counsel
for
petitioner
withdrew
his
request.
this
came
up
and
the
state
started
to
put
the
testimony
of
sheriff
lee
as
i
recall
at
this
point
and
the
counsel
for
petitioner
initially
objected
and
said,
well,
he
thinks
that
in
order
to
comply
with
jackson
versus
denno
that
another
complete
hearing
must
be
held
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
and
the
judge
started
to
do
that
and
then
he
said,
“no,
i
have
already
done
that
this
morning,
so
i
will
withdraw
that
request.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
of
course,
there
is
no
way
to
psychoanalyze
the
judge
at
this
time
but
our
position
is
that
the
decision
was
followed
as
i
hope
to
show
momentarily.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
alright
sir.
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
there
were
three
confessions
or
at
least
incriminating
admissions
involved
in
this
case.
the
first
was
a
testimony
of
author
lee
walker,
a
negro
laborer
to
the
effect
that
he
saw
the
petitioner
approximately
two
hours
after
the
crime
before
he
had
been
arrested
or
before
he
had
been
confronted
by
anyone
in
authority
at
which
time,
the
petitioner
spontaneously
stated
to
him
that
he
had
attacked
that
white
woman.
this
incriminating
admission
was
admitted
without
objection.
it's
not
challenged
here,
the
petitioner's
counsel
elicited
the
same
thing
on
the
cross-examination.
secondly,
there
was
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
was
an
answer
to
a
question
at
to
where
he'd
been
and
he
said,
he'd
been
playing
dice
somewhere
and
he
asked
him,
“did
you
attack
that
white
woman?”
he
said,
“yes,”
but
the
petitioner
himself
testified
at
the
trial
that
during
this
conversation
that
he
was
threatened
or
mistreated
anyway
when
this
confrontation
took
place
with
these
negro
employees.
the
second
was
the
written
confession
taken
at
worth
county
jail
at
approximately
10:30
p.m.
the
night
following
the
crime.
the
third
was
a
written
confession--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
was
around
three
to
three
--
somewhere
between
3:00
and
3:30
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
third
was
a
written
confession
that
was
taken
on
the
day
of
the
crime
was
read
to
the
petitioner
on
the
monday,
following
the
saturday
of
the
crime
when
he
was
arrested
by
agent
cornelius
of
the
gbi
at
which
time
the
petitioner
acknowledged
that
it
was
true.
a
motion
to
suppress
this
written
confession
was
filed
prior
to
trial.
all
of
the
evidence
relating
to
this
other
than
perhaps
dr.
jackson's
testimony
was
heard
at
this
time,
including
the
sworn
testimony
of
the
petitioner
himself.
the
same
substantial
of
the
same
evidence
was
abused
on
the
motion
to
suppress
that
later
went
in
before
the
jury
except
for
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
not
subjected
to
cross-examination
before
the
jury
because
he
did
not
elect
to
be
sworn.
he
made
an
unsworn
statement
and
the
state
on
the
however
unique
rule
of
the
unsworned
statement.
the
state
has
no
right
to
cross-examine
an
accused
on
his
unsworn
statement
and
in
fact,
if
the
state
had
made
a
motion
to
do
so
or
had
attempted
to
do
so,
the
presence
of
the
jury,
it
would
be
a
ground
for
mistrial.
we
have
a
combination
now.
some
of
us
hope
that
eventually
we'll
get
read
of
it
but
it
lingers
on.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
you
held
that
it
was
a
denial
of
counsel
for
the
judge
to
refuse
to
permit
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
he
has
right
to
take
a
stand
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
held
that
if
he
takes
the
stand
as
a
witness,
he
can
be
questioned
but
that
if
he
simply
elects
to
take
the
--
to
make
the
unsworn
statement,
he
can
be
--
things
can
be
suggested
but
he
is
not
entitle
to
questions
as
it
would
be
on
the
stand.
now,
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner
renewed
his
motion
to
exclude
this
confession.
it
was
admitted
with
respect
to
the
republication
of
the
written
confession
on
monday
following
the
offense.
the
counsel
for
petitioner
initially
objected
to
this
testimony
on
the
ground
that
the
proper
foundation
had
not
been
laid.
the
counsel
for
the
state
there
upon
proceeded
to
make,
to
lay
the
foundation
and
this
time,
the
testimony
was
admitted
without
objection
and
that's
at
page
239
of
the
record.
they
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
preserved
the
objection
to
the
original
written
confession
introduced
during
the
trial.
the
bill
of
exceptions
was
signed
overruling
the
motion
to
suppress
but
in
no
way
on
the
record,
is
there
any
challenge
against
the
--
what
i
refer
to
is
spontaneous
declaration
to
the
turpentine
workers
nor
to
the
republication
of
the
written
confession
on
the
monday
following.
the
written
confession
of
april
the
13th
is
attacked
primarily
on
the
ground
that
the
procedure
utilized
by
the
courts
below
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
jackson
versus
denno
in
providing
a
fair
hearing
in
which
both
the
underlying
factual
issues
and
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
should
be
determined.
the
first
response
that
we
make
to
this
is
that
such
a
hearing
was
held.
petitioner's
counsel
assisted
in
affording
it
by
filing
the
motion
to
suppress.
a
full
hearing
was
held,
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
under
oath,
the
testimony
of
the
two
officers
that
had
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
confession.
this
has
never
been
done
before
in
georgia
on
a
confession.
the
procedure
in
georgia
has
universally
been
for
an
opposite
to
take
the
stand,
and
the
court
to
swear
him,
for
the
counsel
for
the
state
to
ask
him,
“did
you
have
a
conversation
with
the
accused
concerning
him
whether
or
not
he
committed
the
crime?”
“yes.”
“before
he
--
you
had
this
conversation,
did
you
make
any
promises
to
him?
did
you
make
any
threats
or
hold
out
any
hope
of
reward
or
inducement?”
and
then
after
those
--
and
those
questions
or
--
were
pounded
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
jury
is
not
excluded
and
the
court
does
not
in
the
past
hear
all
of
the
evidence
relating
to
the
confession
but
only
the
foundation
questions
from
the
particular
witness
who
was
then
testifying.
so
this
was
a
distinct
departure
from
the
georgia
law,
a
procedure
that
had
been
hitherto
followed
in
our
state.
but
the
only
thing
as
i
see
it
which
the
trial
court
here
did
not
do
which
perhaps
it
should
have
or
could
have
done,
and
i
am
not
certain
in
reading
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
jackson
versus
denno,
as
well
as
boles
versus
stevenson
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
court,
for
the
trial
judge
to
read
into
the
record
an
explicit
finding
of
fact
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
that
was
not
done
here.
we
take
the
position
that
regardless
of
whether
it
was
or
it
wasn't
done
that
it's
harmless
because
in
view
that
we
take
of
the
evidence
relative
to
the
confession,
it
was
not
in
conflict
and
that
it
required
a
finding
of
voluntariness.
now
in
this
respect,
the
undisputed
evidence
shows
the
following.
the
offense
occurred
around
10
o'clock
in
the
morning,
saturday,
april
the
13th
on
a
country
road
near
st.
george
in
charlton
county.
following
the
assault,
the
accused
left
the
scene
of
the
crime,
his
car
wouldn't
run
and
he
walked
down
the
road
in
the
direction
toward
a
negro
settlement
referred
to
as
toledo.
about
2:00
or
3:00
p.m.
later
that
date,
these
two
negro
laborers
noticed
petitioner
upon
being
asked
whether
he
had
attacked
that
white
woman,
petitioner
replied
that
he
had.
this
statement
was
made
before
petitioner
had
ever
been
taken
into
custody,
before
he
had
been
confronted
by
anyone
in
authority.
as
petitioner
started
to
leave,
one
of
these
workers
effectuated
a
citizen's
arrest,
turned
him
over
to
a
mr.
stokes
around
3:30
who
in
turn
delivered
him
to
sgt.
sims
and
trooper
peacock.
these
officers
carried
petitioner
to
dr.
jackson's
office
in
folkston
for
the
purpose
of
examining
his
clothes
to
determine
the
presence
of
any
miniscule
strains
of
having
been
established
that
the
victim
was
in
the
last
days
of
the
month
of
period
at
the
time
of
the
assault.
petitioner
testified
while
he
--
while
he
was
at
the
doctor's
office,
the
doctor
knocked
him
down,
kicked
him
and
dragged
him
over
the
floor.
on
the
other
end,
dr.
jackson
denied
that
he
was
kicked
or
beaten.
there
was
no
questions
propounded
to
dr.
jackson
by
either
the
state
of
the
petitioner
as
--
or
as
a
dragging
is
concerned
–
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
he
said
he
was
not
present
at
all
times.
however
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
right,
but
the
petitioner
said
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
petitioner
said
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
i
might
state
this
also,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
petitioner
himself
testified
that
the
only
person
that
he
tried
to
tie
in
on
this
was
dr.
jackson.
he
did
not
at
any
time
say
any
police
officers
did
anything
wrong
to
him.
in
out
of
view
of
this,
this
court
has
in
a
number
of
decisions
held
at
--
with
the
mere
fact
that
at
some
previous
stage
of
a
prisoner's
arrest
or
incarceration
that
there
may
have
been
some
physical
abuse
that
that
does
not
invalidate
as
a
matter
of
law
any
confession
subsequently
obtained
and
in
fact,
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it
did
not.
the
stein
case
for
example
there
was
undisputed,
that
the
prisoners
did
have
some
marks
on
them
indicating
some
brutality,
but
the
stein
case
specifically
used
the
word
“concurrently
with”
so
we
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
at
one
point,
the
prisoner
may
have
been
involved
in
a
scuffle
does
not
certainly
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
petitioner
himself
admits
that
he
was
not
mistreated
in
the
jail,
that
these
officers
were
nice,
that
they
were
friendly,
that
they
are
--
statement
was
read
to
him,
that
he
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
--
contradictory
to
the
dragging
incident.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
under
the
rules
of
evidence
as
i
recall,
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
a
matter
to
which
there
is
no
evidence
in
conflict,
unless
the
petitioner's
testimony
is
impeached.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
would
be
my
evaluation.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct.
i
might
point
out
that
there's
no
evidence
whatever
that
the
petitioner
was
subjected
to
any
interrogation.
the
whole
context
and
atmosphere
of
this
incident
in
the
doctor's
office
was
not
related
to
confessions.
it
was
related
solely
to
examination
of
his
person
to
determine
the
presence
of
blood
on
his
clothes.
he
was
taken
from
there
approximately
30
miles
away.
he
was
turned
over
to
entirely
different
officers.
he
himself
did
not
say
that
any
officers
had
ever
mistreated
him.
and
all
the
mistreatment
allegations
that
he
makes
in
his
testimony
would
direct
you
to
a
dr.
jackson.
at
some
time
around
6:30
p.m.
after
he
had
been
in
the
jail
about
30
minutes
in
worth
county,
deputy
dudley
jones
happened
to
be
putting
a
prisoner
on
the
third
floor,
petitioner
recognizing
him
as
a
deputy
sheriff
that
he
had
known
previously
in
charlton
county,
called
him
and
inquired,
“mr.
dudley,
are
you
working
here?”
deputy
jones
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
asked
the
petitioner
through
the
bars
what
he
was
doing
there,
at
which
the
petitioner
replied
that
he
had
gotten
in
trouble
with
a
white
woman.
the
deputy
then
asked
him
if
he
wished
to
make
a
statement.
he
stated
that
he
would.
he'd
like
to
talk
to
the
sheriff.
at
the
trial,
petitioner
admitted
talking
to
deputy
jones
and
stated
that
he
was
treated
nice
and
that
no
effort
was
made
to
beat
him
or
to
say
anything
to
him,
that's
page
138-139.
about
10:30
that
same
night
after
sheriff
lee
had
come
to
the
jail,
petitioner
was
brought
downstairs
in
the
presence
of
mr.
jones
and
the
sheriff,
the
constable
and
the
chief
of
police,
the
statement,
a
written
confession
that
he's
primarily
attacked
in
this
case
was
taken.
now,
petitioner
testified
under
oath
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
as
i
say,
he
could
not
have
testified
to
these
facts
at
the
trial
because
the
state
did
not
have
the
right
to
examine
but
only
the
motion
to
suppress
he
testified
that
the
officers
talked
nice
to
him,
that
he
wasn't
beaten
or
threatened,
that
he
wasn't
afraid
of
deputy
jones.
he
was
friendly
to
him,
that
he
recalls
the
sheriff
telling
him
that
anything
he
said
could
be
used
against
him,
that
he
wasn't
scared,
that
the
statement
was
read
to
him
and
that
he
signed
it
because
it
was
right.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
testimony.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
fortas
had
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
knocked
down
or
something.
it's
also
undisputed
that
this
procedure
of
taking
this
statement
at
night
at
the
jail
took
not
more
than
15
to
30
minutes.
there
was
no
persistent
questioning,
there
was
no
protracted
questioning.
it
was
taken
on
the
same
day
that
he
was
arrested
approximately
seven
hours
after
his
arrest.
as
far
as
the
testimony
about
being
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
see
a
lawyer,
the
petitioner
did
not
deny
that.
he
said
that
he
could
not
recall
on
that
issue
one
way
or
another.
that's
at
page
137
and
140.
also,
contrary
to
the
brief,
what
he
said
in
the
brief
of
petitioner,
there
was
a
testimony
that
he
was
advised
that
he
did
not
have
to
make
a
statement
and
that's
at
page
104
of
the
record.
therefore,
what
we
have
is
this
that
the
petitioner
confessed
initially
after
having
been
in
jail
an
hour
or
so
or
at
least
it
was
incriminating
admission,
during
a
casual
conversation,
he
was
in
the
cell
and
the
officer
was
on
the
outside
which
he
called
to
the
officer
himself.
the
written
confession
was
given
approximately
four
hours
later.
interrogation
lasting
about
30
minutes
at
the
most.
in
his
own
testimony
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner
slipped
up
after
stating
that
the
sheriff
had
called
him
and
asked
him
about
signing
a
confession.
he
first
said
that
he
didn't
remember
signing
it
but
then
he
immediately
corrected
himself
and
said
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
signing,
that's
at
pages
135
and
page
248.
on
cross-examination,
he
admitted
that
the
statement
was
read
to
him
and
that
he
signed
it
because
it
was
right,
that's
on
page
141.
it's
not
the
slightest
evidence
that
we
submit
that
this
confessions
made
in
the
jail
were
anything
but
voluntary.
to
hold
otherwise
you
have
to
disregard
the
petitioner's
own
testimony.
so
therefore
we
say
that
even
assuming
arguendo
that
your
decision
in
jackson
does
require
that
the
trial
judge
make
an
explicit
statement
into
the
record
as
to
his
findings
of
fact
that
in
any
such
failure
here
was
harmless.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
which
colloquy
was
that
mr.
justice?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
was
after
dr.
jackson's
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
believe
that's
right
sir
because
as
i
recall
dr.
jackson
testified
first
and
i
believe
i
stated
that
in
reference
to
--
yes,
dr.
jackson
testified
first
in
page
189
and
the
objection,
the
colloquy
that
we
discussed
previously
came
up
in
connection
with
sheriff
lee's
testimony
which
begins
i
believe
at
222.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
i
think
out
of
the
abundance
of
caution,
he
wanted
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how's
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
sir,
he
withdrew
it
at
that
point.
we
further
submit
that
the
same
testimony
refutes
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
because
it
was
secured
by
the
coercive
circumstance.
now
the
fact
if
the
trial
judge
also
submitted
this
confession
to
the
jury,
does
invalidate
it
if
the
previous
determination
by
the
trial
judge
was
itself
sufficient.
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
held
perhaps
along
the
lines
of
the
--
by
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
in
jackson
that
the
issue
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
one
of
the
fact
issues
of
a
case
as
to
which
the
accused
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right
under
our
state
constitution
to
a
jury
trial.
under
the
georgia
law,
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
directed
verdict
of
guilt
to
a
permeable
case
and
we
have
a
statute
that
we
call
the
door
mat
that
strictly
prohibits
the
trial
judge
from
communing
in
extent
upon
what
has
or
has
not
been
proven.
consequently,
at
the
juncture
of
this
confession,
the
trial
judge
was
prohibited
either
from
failing
to
submit
it
to
the
jury
with
appropriate
instructions
or
else
from
spading
to
the
jury
his
opinion
is
to
what
he
had
found
and
this
is
where
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
got
[inaudible].
the
supreme
court
of
georgia's
decision,
page
338
of
the
record,
seems
to
and
what
i
consider,
i
hope
my
interpretation
is
correct
to
confuse
what
this
court
held
in
jackson
versus
denno.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
seems
to
be
saying
or
assuming
that
jackson
versus
denno
requires
that
the
trial
judge
advise
the
jury
of
his
independent
determination.
i
do
not
so
--
i
do
not
construe
jackson
versus
denno
to
do
that.
i
think
that
that's
necessarily
implied
in
the
opinion
insofar
as
you
expressly
approved
the
massachusetts
rule
under
which
the
issue
is
determined
by
both
the
judge
and
the
jury
and
that
is
what
we
submit
that
the
trial
judge
did
here.
of
course
whether
or
not
there
was
a
compliance
with
jackson
versus
denno,
is
a
federal
question
for
this
court
and
not
for
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
to
decide.
supreme
court
of
georgia
seem
to
assume
except
for
the
undisputed
evidence
aspect
of
it
that
would
not
have
been
in
compliance
with
jackson
versus
denno
except
for
these
three
factors
that
mr.
greenberg
touched
on
which
i
won't
not
deal
with.
that
brings
me
to
the
challenge
as
to
the
standards
that
were
used
to
determine
voluntariness.
the
charge
complaint
of
essentially
was
a
code
section
that's
been
the
law
of
georgia
many
years.
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
they
were
not
to
consider
the
confession
that
it
was
to
be
received
with
caution
that
a
confession
alone
uncorroborated
by
other
evidence
will
not
just
file
conviction.
to
make
a
confession
admissible,
it
must
have
been
made
freely
and
voluntarily
without
being
induced
by
the
slightest
hope
of
benefit
or
the
modus
fear
of
injury.
that
charge
if
anything
we
submit
is
more
complete
than
just
a
simple
test
of
voluntariness
that
this
court
enunciated
in
the
gallegos
versus
nebraska
decision.
we
submit
that
the
charge
did
not
limit
the
jury
to
considering
just
mere
direct
threats
and
open
promises.
the
court
--
this
court
has
not
yet
held
that
a
state
court
must
give
a
trial
jury,
a
resume
of
it's
holdings
and
all
of
the
factual
circumstances,
the
myriad
situations
that
ever
risen
and
tell
them
that
they
may
consider
all
of
that.
that
has
never
been
held
and
in
fact
you
held
just
to
the
contrary
in
lyons
versus
oklahoma
which
has
held
at
the
question
as
to
how
specific
a
charge
to
the
jury
on
an
issue
of
confession
must
be
primarily
a
question
for
the
state
courts.
rogers
versus
richmond,
that
does
not
hold
anything
to
the
contrary
and
simply
holds
it
where
it
is
seen
that
the
trial
judge
both
in
his
determination
and
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury,
considered
the
probable
reliability
of
the
confession
as
one
element
in
determining
it's
voluntariness
if
that
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
the
specific
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
brennan
about
the
implications
to
be
drawn
from
a
denial
of
the
overruling
of
the
motion
to
suppress
would
be
precluded
against
petitioner
in
the
culombe
case
at
367
u.s.
of
603
-
604
if
that
is
still
the
law.
we
next
wish
to
address
a
few
remarks
to
the
contention
as
far
as
escobedo
was
concerned.
we
think
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
escobedo.
here,
the
petitioner
was
expressly
told
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
lawyer
and
he
said
he
didn't
want
one.
he
testified
himself
at
the
trial
under
oath
that
he
remembers
the
sheriff
telling
him
that
anything
he
said
could
be
used
against
him
and
not
only
that
he
never
requested
a
counsel,
he
expressly
declined
it.
he
was
also
told
that
he
didn't
have
to
make
a
statement
as
i
previously
stated
and
that's
on
page
104.
the
evidence
does
show
that
he
had
only
a
third
grade
education
but
if
you
read
his
testimony
as
a
whole
other
than
you
get
to
the
places
where
the
manufactured
testimony
about
can
you
define
or
do
you
know
what
is
meant
by
constitutional
rights
about
being
advised
about
your
rights,
he
responded
very
well
to
the
questions.
he
handled
himself
in
a
perfect
manner
that
indicated
he
knew
what
is
going
on.
now
in
escobedo
of
course,
there
the
accused
requested
counsel
and
it
was
specifically
denied
and
following
that
a
confession
was
taken
that
is
not
to
this
case.
as
far
as
the
jury
selection
procedures,
we
think
that
the
evidence
shows
this
that
even
assuming
that
this
evidence
as
to
the
prior
jury
list
had
come
in
and
had
been
admitted
and
even
assuming
that
it
had
created
--
carried
the
burden
at
most
evidence
of
prior
jury
list
can
establish
as
a
prima
facie
case.
it
cannot
conclusively
establish
discrimination
as
to
this
particular
jury.
it
creates
a
prima
facie
case
shifting
the
burden
to
the
state
to
go
forward.
we
think
the
evidence
here
shows
that
there
had
been
a
revision
just
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
spring
of
1964.
there
was
one
negro
on
the
19
men
grand
jury.
there
were
nine
negroes
on
the
99
summoned
for
the
traverse
jury
and
at
least
four
of
these
nine
were
put
upon
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
he
so
alleges
at
page
321
in
his
amended
motion
for
new
trial
and
the
trial
judge
certified
that
which
thereby
established
that
as
a
fact
and
this
is
between
–
stated
that
only
three
were
put
upon
him
but
they
allege
in
their
motion
that
four
and
that's
been
approved.
georgia
law
as
we
will
deal
further
in
the
whitus
case,
i
do
not
oppose
to
argue
the
issue
about
the
tax
digest
in
this
case
because
the
same
thing
comes
up
in
the
whitus
case,
but
georgia
law
limits
jury
service
to
tax
payers.
in
this
respect,
the
negroes
constituted
20%
of
the
tax
payers
in
charlton
county
with
411
negroes
to
1548
white
people,
but
of
the
691
non-white
persons
in
charlton
county,
25
years
of
age
or
older,
302
were
functionally
illiterate
according
the
census
bureau.
we
think
that
the
negro
representation
on
the
jury
here
compares
favorably
with
that
it
was
upheld
in
swain
versus
alabama
and
brown
versus
allen
and
then
regardless
of
whether
the
trial
judge
did
or
not
err
in
excluding
this
evidence,
the
most
that
it
would
have
done
would
have
established
the
prima
facie
case
in
that
the
evidence
as
to
this
particular
box
--
that
we
submit,
overcame
in
such
a
prima
facie
showing.
