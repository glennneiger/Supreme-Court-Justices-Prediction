mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
is
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
following
the
second
trial
of
petitioner,
isaac
sims,
a
negro,
who
was
convicted
on
both
occasions
of
the
alleged
rape
of
a
white
woman
in
charlton
county,
georgia
in
april
1963.
following
the
first
trial,
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
his
court
appointed
counsel
took
no
appeal
shortly
before
the
date
of
execution
one
of
the
present
counsel
on
the
case
was
engaged
by
sentence,
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
secured
a
reversal
of
the
conviction
on
the
ground
that
inadequate
representation
of
counsel.
the
second
trial
was
held
on
october
7,
1964,
petitioner
sims
was
re-indicted
on
october
6,
the
day
before
the
second
trial
commenced.
he
was
found
guilty
once
more
and
sentenced
to
death
on
october
8,
1964.
this
case
presents
two
categories
of
issues
to
the
court.
the
first
involved
discriminations
selection
of
grand
and
petty
juries
which
we
claim
was
conducted
contrary
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
second
involves
various
issues
revolving
around
in
alleged
confession.
we
submit
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
i
would
submit
if
any
of
our
points
were
good,
you
would
not
have
to
reach
any
of
the
other
of
the
points.
we
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
georgia
court
didn't
--
that's
what
i
read
them
as
having
said
but
their
language
--
it
was
not
precisely
that
their
language
was
they
denounced
the
decision
as
illogical,
impracticable,
something
to
create
chaos
and
so
forth.
they
said,
we
didn't
do
what
jackson
requires
but
this
is
distinguishable
because
georgia
has
three
rules
of
law
that
new
york
didn't
have
and
so
this
is
rather
different.
beside
they
said
there
was
no
factual
issue
involved
and
we
claim
that
there
was
indeed
a
factual
issue
and
if
anything
the
factual
issue
should
be
resolved
in
the
ground
that
this
confession
was
coerced
as
matter
of
law
as
i
hope
to
be
able
to
demonstrate.
on
the
confession
issue,
we
claim
first
of
all
that
the
confession
was
secured
by
means
which
is
a
matter
of
law
are
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
secondly
this
confession
was
appraised
by
the
state
courts
according
to
standards
not
inconformity
with
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
finally
was
received
in
evidence
according
to
procedures
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
like
to
first
discuss
the
jury
question.
on
pages
three
to
four
of
the
record,
there
is
a
clean
abatement
which
attacks
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury.
it
alleges
that
there
has
been
over
period
of
years
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes,
that
the
grand
jury
is
selected
from
the
tax
digest
that
many
negroes'
names
appear
on
the
tax
digest
and
many
negroes
in
the
community
are
upright
and
intelligent
citizens,
that
over
period
of
10
years,
virtually
no
negroes
have
served
on
the
grand
jury,
that
there
has
been
none
as
jury
commissioners
are
and
that
the
tax
digest
are
kept
on
basis
of
race
indicating
who's
colored
and
who's
white
in
the
very
book
which
is
the
source
of
the
grand
jurors.
the
clean
abatement
also
alleged
that
there
was
neither
notice
nor
reasonable
opportunity
to
petitioner
to
challenge
the
array
of
the
grand
jury
prior
to
the
time
of
the
return
of
the
indictment
which
took
petitioner
by
surprise.
petitioner
supposed
that
he
was
going
to
be
try
on
the
first
indictment
and
the
trial
was
set
for
the
seventh,
he
walked
into
court
was
still
down
to
six,
he'd
been
re-indicted
by
another
grand
jury.
there
was
also
a
challenged
to
the
array
of
the
traverse
jury
and
that
appears
in
the
record,
pages
68
and
it
claimed
that
there
was
a
system
of
selection
whereby
negroes
who
excluded
and
included
on
the
basis
of
race
and
that
negroes
selected
negroes
who
might
have
served
down
traverse
jury
was
systematically
struck
from
service
on
the
basis
of
race
and
then
there
were
some
additional
charges
which
similar
to
those
made
in
connection
with
the
grand
jury.
now,
petitioner
will
not
elaborate
on
what
the
law
is
that
governs
the
jury
question
because
it
is
familiar
to
this
court
and
has
been
argued
at
least
several
times
each
term
but
in
the
phrase,
it
is
that
a
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
members
of
his
own
race,
on
a
panel
or
on
a
jury
which
tries
him.
he's
merely
entitled
not
to
have
them
systematically
excluded
and
the
way
this
issue
has
been
tried
in
case
after
case
has
been
to
look
at
the
history
and
see
what
has
been
the
method
of
selection
of
the
jury,
what
have
been
the
results
and
what
kind
of
a
judgment
can
you
make
from
these
facts
and
that
would
be
particularly
appropriate
in
this
case
because
even
though
petitioners
was
re-indicted
a
day
before
his
trial
but
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
method
of
selection
on
the
new
indictment
is
any
different
from
the
method
of
selection
that
has
been
used
over
all
the
years
in
the
past
and
indeed
to
extent
of
the
record
indicates
it,
it
is
the
same
method
of
selection
and
does
rely
upon
the
tax
digest
which
are
divided
on
the
basis
of
race
and
white
person's
name
or
in
white
pages
and
negro
person's
name
are
on
yellow
pages.
mr.
jack
greenberg
why
was
he
re-indicted?
it
doesn't
appear.
the
only
possible
reason
one
might
imagine
is
that
to
secure
a
new
grand
jury
in
order
to
do
it
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
this
grand
jury
was
selected
by
any
different
method
than
any
of
previous
grand
jurors
but
there
is
--
the
second
indictment
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
first
indictment.
since
was
the
21
--
it
seems
didn't
know
was
on
may
to
which
is
part
of
our
charge
on
the
confession
point
that
he
is
so
ignored
he
wasn't
--
didn't
know
was
on
his
but
at
the
time
of
trial
he
was
either
27
or
29.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
second
trial
was
two
years
after
the
alleged
incident.
no,
one
year
after
the
allegiance
in
the
'60
--
october,
1964
and
the
alleged
incident
was
in
april
1963.
at
the
out
set
of
the
hearing
on
the
jury
point,
petitioner
offered
in
to
evidence
the
certified
register
of
the
jury
list
of
the
previous
10
years
and
this
was
the
very
first
thing
that
he
did.
and
this
obviously
was
a
prelude
to
an
examination
concerning
the
pattern
of
jury
selection.
this
has
occurred
as
i
said
on
numerous
cases.
in
page
50
of
our
brief,
we
cite
perhaps
the
half
page
full
of
citations
of
cases
in
which
this
and
other
courts
have
looked
to
the
practices
of
years
passed
in
order
to
make
a
judgment
on
this
point.
there
was
an
objection,
the
counsel
for
the
state
said,
“i
mean
to
object
that
any
list
of
any
grand
jury
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
present
grand
jury
or
petty
jury
and
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
particular
grand
jury
or
petty
jury.”
and
the
court
said,
“i
am
the
opinion
that
would
be
right.”
the
objections
were
sustained
and
so
as
to
leave
no
doubt
whatsoever
about
the
grounds
of
sustaining
them,
the
grounds
of
the
ruling
on
the
state
supreme
court,
we
find
on
page
331
of
the
record
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
court
properly
excluded
jury
lists
for
prior
years.
they
would
not
be
relevant
in
the
face
of
a
showing
that
no
discrimination
existed
in
the
composition
of
the
present
juries.
so,
the
holding
below
and
both
the
trial
and
the
appellate
courts
were
that
petitioner
would
not
be
permitte
to
demonstrate
what
the
pattern
of
selection
had
been
over
the
past
leading-up
into
the
present.
and
we
submit
that
on
this
ground
alone
and
we
will
discussed
the
method
of
selection,
the
yellow
and
white
pages
in
a
moment
but
in
this
ground
of
alone
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
carter
against
texas
and
the
decision
of
a
term
or
two
go
in
coleman
against
alabama
that
is
reversible
error
in
and
of
itself
for
this
petitioner
at
a
minimum
has
a
right
to
prove
his
case
and
his
case
consists
of
demonstrating
what
the
method
of
selection
is
and
what
kind
of
juries
this
method
produces
and
he
wasn't
permitted
to
do
that.
now,
on
this
grand
jury,
we
do
know
that
if
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
petitioner,
there
was
a
stipulation
that
there
was
a
single
negro
and
we
do
know
that
on
the
petty
jury
array
of
99,
there
were
five
negroes
and
if
we
put
together
the
names
of
the
negroes
alongside
the
list
of
strikes
which
appear
on
page
19
to
21
of
the
record,
we
also
know
that
three
negroes
were
struck
by
the
state
and
two
negroes
were
never
reached,
so
all
five
negroes
were
disposed
of.
now,
we
submit
that
if
we
could
demonstrate
--
forbidden
to
demonstrate,
if
this
have
been
the
pattern
of
the
past
10
years
or
less
over
period
of
many
years
at
all
that
there
have
been
no
more
representation
in
this,
so
perhaps
less
representation
on
this,
there
would
be
clear
grounds
reversal
but
petitioner
was
never
permitted
to
show
anything
about
the
previous
years
and
all
we
have
is
the
--
this
bid
of
evidence
about
the
single
year
which
in
and
on
of
itself
is
a
suspicious
to
the
point
of
i
think
indicating
to
a
certainty
that
something
was
a
missed
in
the
method
of
selection
in
so
far
as
securing
adequate
representation
without
regard
to
race.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
have
those
statistics
here
mr.
chief
justice.
the
white
population
over
age
21
on
the
county
was
1,928
and
the
non-white
population
over
21
was
728.
now,
the
jurors
were
selected
from
the
tax
digest
and
the
white
taxpayers
in
the
county
were
1,548
and
the
negro
taxpayers
were
411.
mr.
jack
greenberg
charlton
county,
georgia.
now,
the
method
of
selection
that
was
employed,
we
submit,
is
unconstitutional
per
se
but
certainly
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
small
representation
that
petitioner
was
permitted
to
show
and
the
refusal
to
permit
him
to
demonstrate
whether
the
representation
have
been
the
same
or
perhaps
less
in
the
past
adds
up
to
a
reversible
error.
now,
the
commissioner
and
here's
the
way
the
jury
was
made
up,
the
commissioners
testified
or
a
commissioner
testified
that
they
went
through
the
tax
digest
list
so
these
are
two
books,
one
book
for
negroes,
one
book
for
whites,
the
book
for
whites
raving
there
were
in
single
volume
but
the
pages
for
whites
were
white,
the
pages
of
negroes
were
yellow.
the
commissioner
went
through
the
white
pages
alphabetically
a
to
z
and
they
said
around
the
table
and
somebody
said
john
jones
and
somebody
said,
i
know
him,
he's
pretty
good
and
there
were
another
names
that
i'm
hope
so
and
so
and
say,
let's
not
take
him
and
they
didn't
take
him,
went
to
this
informal
manner.
when
they
got
all
through
with
the
white
names
they
then
took
up
the
negro
names
and
so
at
the
very
outset
there
was
a
method
of
selection
which
intrudes
thrust
under
the
very
knows
of
the
jury
commissioners,
the
consideration
of
race
then
these
names
are
put
on
the
box
and
the
judge
selects
from
the
box
in
appropriate
number
of
a
grand
and
petty
jurors
and
a
proportion
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
just
suppose
to
reach
and
pull
their
names
out,
i
mean
i
–-
this
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
a
way,
but
yes
they're
in
put
together
indiscriminately.
they're
on
the
same
colored
paper
and
you
no
longer
have
yellow
and
white
paper
and
that
the
judge
then
selects
as
in
this
case
99
for
the
petty
jury
array
and
then
counsel
select
the
jury
from
that
array.
now,
we
claim
first
of
all
that
the
very
outset
the
method
of
selection
is
infected
with
racial
consideration.
this
court
has
held
in
hamm
against
virginia
that
the
maintenance
of
tax
list
on
these
basis,
there
is
no
jury
question
involved
in
that
case
but
the
maintenance
of
tax
list
on
this
basis
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
a
case
that
is
very
much
in
point
we
submit
is
anderson
against
morton,
the
louisiana
case
which
said
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
place
the
race
of
a
candidate
next
to
his
name
on
a
ballot
and
the
reason
that
is
unconstitutional
is
that
at
the
last
moment
before
the
voter
makes
his
choice
the
state
thrust
under
his
nose
the
racial
consideration.
it's
the
only
thing
that
the
state
tells
him
at
that
point
and
the
court
held
that
this
was
impermissible
combination
of
private
and
public
action
that
while
you
could
not
stop
voters
from
knowing
what
the
race
of
the
candidates
would
be
and
in
fact
in
most
cases
they
would
be
expected
to
know
and
no
way
certainly
couldn't
read
their
minds,
you
know
why
they
voted
for
candidates
in
some
instances
they
might
vote
for
him
on
a
basis
of
race
or
might
vote
against
him
on
a
basis
race.
nevertheless,
for
the
states
to
inject
the
racial
consideration
that
thrust
forward
at
that
point
was
impermissible.
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
farfetched
analogy
to
say
that
what
the
jury
commissioners
at
this
point
are
doing
is
electing
juror.
they're
going
to
the
list
and
the
one
piece
of
written
information,
the
one
thing
on
the
face
of
the
documents
from
which
they
are
making
the
selection
is
the
yellow
one
and
white
pages
and
in
fact,
it's
done
in
a
way
which
almost
invites
setting
up
some
sort
of
proportion
because
when
they
get
all
of
a
group
the
white
pages
then
sort
of
placed
in
a
position
where
they
have
to
save
themselves.
well,
how
many
negroes
shall
we
choose
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
have?
mr.
jack
greenberg
of
the
--
and
petty
jury
array
in
this
case,
there
were
99,
i
don't
know
–
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
information
isn't
available,
mr.
justice
harlan
but
we
do
now
that
the
array
was
presumably
chosen
out
of
the
box
by
fair
selection
process
just
totally
by
chance
so
far
as
anyone
can
tell
produced
five
negroes
out
of
99.
now,
in
a
case
that
involved
the
colors
yellow
and
white
corresponding
to
negro
and
white,
avery
against
georgia,
we
had
a
situation
in
which
there
were
yellow
and
white
tickets
in
the
jury
box
and
it
had
not
been
established
that
anyone
did
use
these
yellow
and
white
tickets
for
an
invidious
racial
purpose.
it
wasn't
known.
one
of
the
concurring
opinions
pointed
out,
that
it
might
have
been
possible
peek
into
the
box
but
nobody
did
know
that
anyone
actually
had
peeked
into
it
but
the
opportunity
for
discrimination
which
the
use
of
yellow
and
white
tickets
presented
plus
the
fact
of
this
proportionately
small
representation
was
held
by
this
court
to
warrant
a
reversal
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
submit
that
this
case
is
even
stronger
than
avery
against
georgia
because
we
do
know
that
the
jury
commissioners
in
selecting
the
jury
did
know
who
is
negro
and
who
was
white
as
a
result
of
looking
at
the
yellow
and
white
pages.
and
in
fact,
while
we
have
a
very
small
proportion
on
the
base
of
the
information
that's
now
possessed
by
us,
we
were
precluded
from
demonstrating
in
fact
what
the
proportion
actually
was.
so,
we
submit
that
on
uncontradicted
evidence
out
the
mouth
of
the
jury
commissioners
and
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
georgia,
we
have
a
situation
here
in
which
the
jury
was
selected
in
a
manner
who
are
not
permitted
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
i
now
like
to
argue
the
second
portion
of
our
argument
and
that
relates
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
and
evidence,
the
standards
by
which
it
was
committed
in
evidence,
the
standards
by
which
it
was
praised.
petitioner
contends
that
the
process
followed
below
violates
principles
declared
by
this
court
in
jackson
against
denno
and
if
we
turn
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
we'll
find
a
number
of
things
that
the
state
supreme
court
had
to
say
about
jackson
against
denno
though
with
made
no
effort
to
demonstrate,
it
was
in
compliance
but
only
to
distinguish
it.
it
said
that
the
jackson
decision
is
illogical,
impracticable
and
utterly
unsound.
it
said
that
we
hope
the
present
justices
will
after
more
mature
consideration
overrule
jackson
against
denno.
said,
of
jackson
against
denno,
that
an
alarming
injustice
is
being
unintentionally
forced
upon
american
courts
and
having
said
this
that
proceeded
to
distinguish
this
case
in
jackson
against
denno
while
they
said
at
no
point
ever
asserting
that
it
had
in
fact
follow
the
jackson
against
denno
procedure.
now,
before
considering
all
of
the
distinctions
on
which
the
decision
of
the
georgia
court
purports
to
rest,
i
should
like
to
for
a
moment
to
discuss
one
of
them
that
is
on
page
339
of
the
record
in
the
opinion
of
the
states
supreme
court.
it
stated,
there
was
no
evidence
to
make
any
issue
of
voluntariness.
without
an
issue,
there
is
nothing
to
try.
now,
we
submit
however
that
not
only
is
there
an
issue
of
voluntariness
that
this
issue
in
voluntariness
on
uncontradicted
testimony
on
this
record.
testimony
such
of
this
court
has
considered
in
other
confession
cases
that
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
record
there
can
only
be
one
determination
and
that
is
–-
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
at
what
point
i
would
draw
the
line,
but
i
would
say
certainly
within
the
matters
after
–-
within
matter
of
hours
after
the
events
in
the
doctor's
office,
there
would
be
no
doubt
about
it.
he
stated
he
was
in
pain
for
period
of
several
weeks
thereafter
and
i
think
that's
quite
believable
given
the
uncontradicted
testimony
and
what
had
happened
to
him.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
not
alone
but
if
you
take
this
extreme
pain
and
had
been
afflicted
upon
him
by
somewhat
to
whom
the
police
had
brought
him
as
part
of
the
process
of
investigation
that
this
man
cannot
read
or
write,
he
graduated
from
the
third
grade
if
you
may
call
it
graduated
at
age
17
or
18,
doesn't
even
know
his
own
age,
doesn't
know
when
his
father
died,
totally
ignorant.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
he
said
the
sheriff
scolded
him
and
i
would
think
that
having
been
through
the
experience
he
was
through
just
several
hours
earlier.
he
was
probably
not
in
any
position
to
think
even
as
clearly
as
he
might
that
is
clearest.
we
like
to
--
in
introducing
the
confession
point
just
state
who
this
petitioner
is
and
i
said
a
word
or
two
about
it,
he's
indigent,
he's
ignorant,
finished
the
third
grade
at
age
17
or
18,
he's
illiterate,
can't
read
or
write.
he
can
write
his
name
as
he
says
pretty
good
but
that's
all.
wasn't
quite
certain
what
his
own
age
is,
his
father,
mother
or
daddy
didn't
know
when
his
father
died.
there
were
some
elaborate
recitations
in
the
confession
he
suppose
to
have
given
there
were
written
into
it
which
were
they
later
admitted
that
he
hadn't
given
that
they
wrote
in
all
in
their
own
but
to
many
simply
words
in
there
words
that
even
many
illiterates
might
be
expected
to
understand,
he
didn't
understand.
i
think
this
testimony
all
rings
through,
“isaac,
do
you
know
what
freely
and
voluntarily
means?”
“i
beg
your
pardon?”
“do
you
know
what
freely
and
voluntarily
means?"
“freely
and
voluntarily?”
“voluntarily.”
“no,
sir
i
do
not.”
“do
you
know
what
is
meant
by
the
statement
can
be
used
against
you
in
court?”
“statement
can
be
used
against
me?”
“statement
can
be
used
against
you
in
court,
do
you
know
what
that
means?”
“no
sir.”
“do
you
know
what
it
means
to
be
informed
of
your
legal
rights?”
“well,
that's
like
being
good
or
something?”
“is
that
what
means
to
you,
isaac?”
“yes
sir.”
and
this
goes
on
for
a
several
pages.
there's
one
page,
on
page
141,
he
is
--
page
144
rather,
he's
asked,
“do
you
know
what
normal
and
ordinary
mean,
isaac,”
which
i
submit
that
many
illiterate
understand
like
you're
sick
or
something,
is
that
would
have
means
to
you?
“i
imagine
so,
yes
sir.”
so
this
is
the
man
that
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
argument
concluded
yesterday,
i
was
discussing
the
confession
issue
and
had
just
completed
describing
the
background
and
the
–
what
this
petitioner
is
like
which
is
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
examines
in
going
to
the
question
of
whether
a
confession
is
coerced
and
i
was
doing
that
in
connection
with
the
state
supreme
court’s
treatment
of
jackson
v.
denno
and
in
which
the
state
supreme
court
said
among
other
things
in
distinguishing
jackson
v.
denno
from
this
case
that
there
was
no
issue
of
voluntariness
to
be
tried
and
we
submit
that
in
the
contrary
that
there
was
indeed
an
issue
and
that
that
issue
could
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
on
uncontradicted
testimony.
i
pointed
out
that
this
petitioner
was
indigent.
he
was
ignorant
that
he
finished
the
third
grade
only
at
age
17
or
18
that
he
could
not
read
or
write
except
his
name
and
he
didn't
know
the
year
that
he
was
born.
he
knew
that
his
father
was
dead
and
did
not
know
when
he'd
died
and
so
forth
and
i've
read
from
the
record
colloquy
with
the
petitioner
which
indicated
his
inability
to
understand
even
ordinary
common
phrases
including
a
good
number
that
had
been
attributed
to
him
in
the
so
called
confession.
now,
this
is
the
man
of
whom
we're
talking
and
i
now
like
to
say
what
happened
to
him
and
shortly
following
arrest,
he
was
taken
to
the
office
of
dr.
jackson
for
examination
and
his
alleged
statement
said
that
there
were
bloodstains
on
his
clothing
and
dr.
jackson
helped
remove
this
clothing
from
him.
there
is
some
dispute
about
the
vigor
with
which
dr.
jackson
did
this
but
no
dispute
at
all
that
dr.
jackson
played
a
part
in
removing
his
clothing.
he
was
brought
there
by
state
police
and
there
were
seven
or
eight
state
troopers
on
the
premises
at
that
time
and
they
were
in
uniform
wearing
guns
and
i'd
now
like
to
read
a
few
lines
from
the
record.
question,
“what
happened
to
you
isaac?”
“well,
dr.
jackson
some
one
knocked
me
down
and
kick
me
over
my
eyelid
and
busted
my
eye
on
the
right
side.”
“did
anything
else
happen
to
you?”
“and
he
grabbed
me
by
my
private
and
dragged
me
on
the
floor.”
“did
he
drag
you
by
your
private
on
the
floor?”
“yes
sir.”
“did
it
hurt
you
a
lot?”
“yes
sir,
pretty
bad.”
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
particular
statement
is
never
contradicted
and
was
never
gone
into
cross-examination
and
it
was
something
that
was
repeated
at
a
subsequent
state
of
the
proceedings
later
on
in
the
record.
neither
jackson
or
any
of
the
seven
or
eight
police
officers
who
are
present
and
presumably
were
available
to
the
state
and
indeed
dr.
jackson
testified,
he
was
available
to
the
state
beyond
doubt,
ever
contradicted
with
this
particular
charge.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
denied
some
aspects
of
what,
i'd
like
to
go
into
his
testimony
in
a
moment,
denied
some
aspects
of
what
sims
said
and
i
submit
in
a
very
equivocal
way
but
never
discussed
this
particular
aspect
of
it
and
this
was
subsequent
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
urging
both
mr.
justice
white.
i
say
that
they
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i
plan
to
discuss
it
in
a
moment.
if
you
like
i
could
do
it
right
now.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
some
of
it
came
up
during
the
trial
also.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
just
said,
i
deny.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
that
there
is
with
some
diffidence
that
i
would
say
there's
noncompliance
with
jackson
v.
denno.
as
i
understand
jackson
v.
denno,
it
requires
some
sort
of
a
finding
of
voluntariness
and
there
was
no
finding.
if
we
are
to
read
the
georgia
cases
and
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court,
georgia
has
persisted
in
following
the
law
that
it
had
followed
prior
to
jackson
v.
denno
which
is
admissibility
upon
prima
facie
killer.
mr.
jack
greenberg
or
have
no
doubt.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
standard
which
the
court
applied
was
that
it
admitted
the
evidence
upon
a
prima
facie
showing
of
voluntariness
and
that
prima
facie
showing
consisted
of
responses
to
the
so
called
statutory
questions
which
is
a
few
pro
forma
questions,
was
he
threatened,
was
he
put
into
fear?
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
judge
himself
–
the
judge
himself
does
not
state
the
standard
he
applies
but
all
of
the
georgia
cases
are
compatible
with
what
the
judge
did
and
that
is
just
merely
admit
the
testimony
upon
a
prima
facie
showing.
now
the
judge
didn't
give
a
charge
to
the
jury
on
what
the
standard
of
admissibility
should
be
for
the
jury
and
that
is
once
more
the
traditional
pre
jackson
v.
denno,
georgia
charge
–
that's
in
page
3
–-
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
the
procedure
involves
certain
standards,
whether
or
not
the
testimony
should
be
admitted
upon
finding
a
voluntariness
or
whether
or
not
the
testimony
should
be
admitted
upon
a
prima
facie
showing
even
though
there
might
be
a
conflict
of
the
evidence
in
which
evidence
of
course
might
in
fact
be
overwhelming.
on
page
312
of
the
record
of
the
charge,
the
jury
and
that
of
--
is
an
indication
of
the
standard
of
admissibility
which
the
trial
judge
used,
but
the
state
supreme
court
opinion
does
not
indicate
for
a
moment
and
neither
does
brief
of
the
state.
mr.
jack
greenberg
to
make
a
confession
admissible,
it
must
have
been
made
freely
and
voluntarily
without
being
induced
by
another
by
the
slightest
hope
of
benefit
with
a
remotest
fear
of
injury.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
the
court
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
to
the
extent
that
that's
an
indication
of
what
the
court
had
in
his
mind
which
nowhere
he
indicated.
we
think
that
that
does
not
embody
the
standards
which
this
court
has
set
down
on
rogers
v.
richmond
and
wan
versus
united
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
does
not
take
into
account
for
example
who
this
petitioner
was
and
entire
background
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
confession.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
doesn't
exclude
them
but
it
does
not
point
out
that
there
are
certain
essential
elements
of
the
confession,
circumstances
surrounding
the
confession
which
this
court
described
in
some
detail
on
rogers
v.
richmond
and
wan
versus
united
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
the
jury
should
believe
that
a
confession
was
induced
by
another
--
by
the
slightest
hope
of
benefit
or
the
remotest
fear
of
injury
then
in
that
event
so
forth.
we
submit
that
nevertheless
that
does
not
take
into
account,
the
total
surrounding
circumstances,
who
this
petitioner
was,
his
ignorance,
his
lack
of
education,
there's
no
counsel
present,
he
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
make
a
telephone
call
and
so
forth.
but
i
think
that
the
key
--
the
essential
holding
of
the
state
supreme
court
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
what
the
prior
georgia
law
is,
which
is
at
no
point
repudiated,
at
no
point
amended
and
indeed
reasserted
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
cases
are
cited,
the
jackson
v.
denno
standard
is
denounced,
the
brief
of
the
state
reasserts
that
the
prior
law
is
essentially
still
in
effect
but
they
say
that
jackson
v.
denno
would
not
to
apply
to
this
case
because
georgia
law
is
different
than
new
york
law
and
they
purport
to
distinguish
georgia
law
from
new
york
law
in
three
essentials
on
page
337
of
the
record.
when
we
read
that
opinion,
we
note
a
total
absence
of
any
consideration
therein
of
the
georgia
statute
which
provides
that
a
conviction
cannot
rest
upon
a
confession
alone
but
the
confession
must
be
collaborated.
now
the
requirement
of
collaboration
was
also
present
in
new
york
law
at
the
time
jackson
was
decided.
they
purport
to
distinguish
the
georgia
cases
from
the
new
york
cases
on
the
ground.
this
court
did
not
take
into
account
in
jackson
v.
denno,
a
georgia
statute
requiring
as
an
indispensable
foundation
to
the
introduction
of
an
alleged
confession,
a
showing
that
was
freely
and
voluntarily
made
and
that
it
was
not
induced
by
another
by
the
slightest
fear
of
punishment
or
the
remotest
of
reward
and
that
was
also
to
new
york.
or
of
georgia
law
investing
the
trial
judge
with
unquestionable
power
to
review
the
case
after
conviction
and
to
set
the
verdict
aside
if
he
is
not
satisfied
with
it
and
that's
also
true
new
york
--
corroboration
point
as
well
--
i
might
point
out
to
the
corroboration
point
that
there
is
some
serious
doubt
whether
there
is
any
corroboration
in
the
sense
that
was
required
in
the
charge
of
the
jury
of
linking
this
petitioner
with
the
crime.
for
example,
the
clothing
was
taken
from
him
and
it's
never
been
heard
from
since,
but
that
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
fortas
because
this
court
is
held
in
a
number
of
cases
that
if
an
involuntary
confession
is
admitted
into
evidence,
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
be
other
evidence
which
would
tend
to
sustain
a
conviction
or
corroborate
the
confession,
does
not
save
the
judgment
from
being
reversed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
was.
there's
some
evidence
to
establish
at
the
first
trial
and
they've
never
testified
anything
in
this
sort
but
nevertheless
they
did
in
this
occasion.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that's
correct
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
this
court
and
well,
it's
undisputed
except
in
the
sense
the
petitioner
denied
having
committed
a
crime
but
i
think
this
court
in
many
cases,
at
least
in
a
number
of
cases,
has
considered
a
series
of
confessions
some
of
which
were
objected
to
and
some
of
which
weren't.
and
when
the
court
has
found
that
one
of
the
confessions
is
involuntary
and
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
standards,
the
conviction
has
been
reversed
and
so,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
save
the
judgment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
now,
of
course
what
the
court
did
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
georgia
law,
if
the
georgia
law
was
such
that
the
judge
could
admit
it
only
if
he
found
it
voluntary,
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
we
would
hang
off
on
the
particular
verbal
formulation
that
the
judge
used.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
jackson
v.
denno
was
june
22nd.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
in
fact,
there
was
a
reference
to
the
decision
of
this
court
of
june
22nd.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
so
--
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
state
supreme
court
thought
so.
i
think
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
i
think
the
state
supreme
--
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
some
indication.
best
of
all
of
course,
i
think
there
would
be
something
explicit
and
even.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
imagine
that
that
might
be
expressed
in
a
variety
of
ways
but
it
has
to
be
expressed
in
some
way
and
certainly
if
he
had
made
the
tale
findings,
that
would
be
unexceptionable.
but
he
just
said,
i
deny
the
motion.
should
i
deny
the
motion
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
--
i
would
think
that
might
be
enough
if
the
law
of
the
state
and
the
state
supreme
court
indicated
that
that
meant
--
that
there
was
a
finding
and
it
was
voluntary.
but
the
law
of
the
state
is
not
that
at
all.
the
law
of
the
state
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
it's
a
proper
assumption
in
the
light
of
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court
which
says
that
we
are
not
following
jackson
v.
denno
because
our
--
we
have
a
number
of
provisions
in
georgia
law
which
distinguish
our
case
from
jackson
v.
denno.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
they
said
it
wasn't
applicable
to
the
case
but
there's
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
they
said
it
wasn't
--
they
said
it
wasn't
applicable
for
several
reasons.
first,
they
said
that
there
was
no
conflict
of
testimony.
they
said
that
this
confession
was
clearly
voluntary.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
secondly,
they
said
that
georgia
requires
a
prima
facie
showing,
requires
corroboration
and
the
judge
--
and
a
motion
for
new
trial
can
overrule
the
verdict.
and
a
view
of
that
they
said,
we
don't
have
to
do
what
jackson
v.
denno
says
you
have
to
do
because
we're
in
a
different
kind
of
situation
but
actually
georgia
tend
to
see
the
jackson
v.
denno.
georgia
is
in
the
new
york
category.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
you
find
that
the
georgia
trial
court
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
indeed
complied
with
the
jackson
v.
denno
then
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
the
trial
just
complied
with
jackson
v.
denno
then
i
don't
think
you
could
reverse
on
jackson
v.
denno
and
if
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct
but
i
think
what
the
state
supreme
court
says
sheds
light
on
whether
he
did
or
did
not
comply
with
jackson
v.
denno.
but
even
if
you
didn't
find
that,
i
would
think
that
on
the
uncontradicted
evidence
of
what
happened
to
this
petitioner
under
these
circumstances,
i
would
submit
that
the
court
--
the
court
should
advice
whether
there
were
or
were
not
a
jackson
v.
denno
under
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right,
yes.
i
was
describing
the
uncontradicted
testimony
of
what
had
occurred
in
dr.
jackson's
office
and
i
might
--
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
do
go
into
the
types
of
denials
and
whether
or
not
there
is
contradiction
in
the
evidence,
and
i
think
it's
useful
to
look
at
what
the
testimony
of
dr.
jackson
was
here
because
i
think
his
testimony
carries
with
it
at
certain
unequivocal
indication
of
what
happened
in
this
office
even
though
it
could
be
able
to
count
in
terms
of
denials.
he
was
asked
who
put
--
how
did
sims
get
to
cut
over
his
eye
in
relating
to
sims'
charge
that
dr.
jackson
kicked
him
in
the
office
and
dr.
jackson
says,
“i
don't
know
who
put
it
there.”
and
he
was
asked
if
the
officers
did
and
he
said,
“you'll
have
to
ask
the
officers.”
“i'm
asking
you
dr.
jackson.
i'm
asking
you
whether
or
not
the
officers
were
beating
the
defendant.”
answer,
“i
will
say
that
i
wasn't
there
all
the
time.”
“he
didn't
have
the
cut
over
his
eye
when
he
came
into
your
office,
did
he?”
“i
didn't
see
him
until
after
he
got
in.”
“and
when
you
first
saw
him
in
your
office,
he
didn't
have
it?”
“i
couldn't
see
it.
he
was
sort
of
slumped
over
sort
of
falling
around
like
--
anything
could
have
happened
to
him.”
this
is
what
the
doctor
says
about
what
happened
in
the
office.
“was
sims
kicked?”
“i
don't
know
that
he
was.
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
knocked
down
or
fell
down.”
“did
you
find
him
on
the
floor?
”and
he
says,
“well,
sims
just
sort
of
fell
on
the
floor.”
“he
sort
of
fell?
where
were
you
standing
of
the
time
he
sort
of
fell?”
“i
was
standing
on
my
feet.”
“were
you
standing
near
him?”
“very
close.”
“were
you
standing
as
close
as
i
am
to
you
or
closer?”
“probably
a
little
closer.”
“where
you
could
touch
him?”
“i
think
he
could
touch
me.”
“and
you
could
touch
him?”
“yes.”
but
through
all
these
--
and
dr.
jackson's
--
dr.
jackson's
testimony
throughout
the
trial,
even
though
he
was
equivocal
on
this
and
i
submit
that
this
equivocation
indicates
something,
nevertheless,
even
using
the
standard
that
this
court
has
in
case
that
requires
uncontradicted
testimony,
there
is
no
testimony
at
all
that
sims
was
dragged
around
the
room
by
his
genitals,
and
i
think
very
instructive
that
when
the
solicitor
was
cross
examining
sims
on
what
occurred
to
him
that
day,
he
asserted
very
rapidly
around
what
happened
in
dr.
jackson's
office.
he
went
through
that
day
step
by
step
by
step
but
dr.
jackson's
office
was
sort
of
sandwiched
into
a
sentence
and
he
went
from
toledo
to
waycross
and
there
was
no
examination
of
that
even
on
cross-examination.
now,
we
submit
that
in
the
pikes
(ph)
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
a
standard
and
we
feel
should
apply
to
this
case.
there
is
quote
on
page
37
of
our
brief,
which
is
that,
it
is
common
ground
that
if
this
record
had
disclosed
an
admission
by
the
police
of
one
truncheon
blow
on
the
head
of
the
petitioner,
a
confession
following
such
a
blow
would
be
inadmissible.
in
the
stein
case,
quote
in
the
brief
also,
essentially,
the
same
standard
of
state.
its
slight
evident,
even
inquisitive
testimony
that
defendants
injury
occurred
during
the
period
of
detention
or
at
the
hands
of
the
police
or
failure
by
the
prosecution's
to
meet
the
charge
with
all
the
reasonably
available
evidence
might
well
have
tipped
the
scales
of
decision
below.
he
even
hear
it
without
force
if
there
were
any
evidence
whatever
to
connect
the
admitted
injuries
with
the
event
of
a
period
of
interrogation
but
there
is
no
such
word
in
the
record.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
that
on
the
jackson
v.
denno
point
that
sims'
charge
and
sims'
statement
about
what
happened
to
him
in
the
office
at
the
pretrial
hearing
was
at
no
point
contradicted.
so
far
as
the
evidence
on
that
is
concerned
on
the
pretrial
hearing
when
the
trial
judge
ruled,
all
he
had
was
sims'
testimony
about
being
kicked
and
dragged
around
the
floor
in
the
doctor's
office
and
at
that
point,
we
didn't
even
have
dr.
jackson's
testimony
in
denial.
dr.
jackson
testified
for
the
first
time
on
these
questions
during
the
trial.
now,
the
state
supreme
court
as
i
pointed
out
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that's
the
testimony
i
was
describing.
that
is
dr.
jackson's
only
testimony
about
what
occurred
in
his
office.
did
the
police
said
--
you'll
have
to
ask
the
police,
i
wasn't
in
there
all
the
time.
anything
could
have
happened
to
him.
he
use
to
sort
of
falling
all
over
and
so
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
state
had
testimony
of
a
deputy
sheriff
in
which
he
mrerly
went
into
what
the
court
has
referred
to
as
the
statutory
question.
did
you
offer
him
anything?
and
this
was
all
testimony
that
related
to
what
occurred
in
the
jail.
did
you
put
him
in
fear?
did
you
promise
him
anything
that
sort
of
stuff?
that
is
here
in
the
record
on
page
113
as
i
say
that
is
just
the
statutory
questions.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
he
said,
they
brought
him
down,
they
interrogate
him,
they
scolded
him,
i
don't
know
what
he
might
have
meant
by
that,
but
at
that
point,
he
said
he
was
in
terrible
pain
and
he
was
--
this
petitioner
as
i
have
stated,
but
on
the
jackson
v.
denno
point,
i
think
it's
crucial
that
as
of
the
time,
the
court
ruled
upon
that.
he
had
the
petitioner's
statement
about
the
brutally
inflicted
upon
him.
he
had
evidence
of
who
this
petitioner
was
and
he
had
statements
of
the
state
that
at
--
at
the
jail,
there
was
a
--
he
was
asked
the
so
called
statutory
question
and
the
state
supreme
court
at
no
point
here,
makes
an
effort
to
demonstrate
that
the
jackson
v.
denno
standards
complied
with.
all
the
state
says
as
well,
it
was
--
we
have
other
rules
of
law
here
which
don't
require
this
to
be
done
and
in
any
event,
if
there
was
error,
it
was
harmless
error.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
reference
also
to
the
argument
that
we
make
that
the
state
did
not
follow
the
standards
set
down
by
this
court
for
judging
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
those
standards
i
think
have
stated
that
quite
an
early
date
in
wan
against
united
states,
and
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
brandeis
wrote
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
held
the
prisoner's
statement
is
admissible
on
the
ground
that
a
confession
made
by
one
competent
to
act
is
to
be
deemed
voluntary
as
a
matter
of
law
if
it
was
not
induced
by
a
promise
or
a
threat,
that
was
only
the
standard
that
georgia
has
used.
and
mr.
justice
brandeis
went
on
to
say,
“a
confession
is
voluntary
in
law
if
and
only
if
it
was
in
fact
voluntarily
made.
a
confession
obtained
by
compulsion
must
be
excluded.”
and
in
rogers
v.
richmond,
the
court
went
on
to
elaborate
on
this
and
indicated
that
corroboration
was
not
evidence
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
and
yet,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
relies
upon
what
the
trial
court
refers
to
as
statutory
question
on
page
211
in
qualifying
the
admissibility
of
a
statement.
the
judge
says,
we'll
ask
him
the
statutory
questions
and
he's
asked,
did
anybody
offer
him
anything?
was
he
threatened?
was
he
promised?
the
modus
sphere
of
injury,
the
judge
says
admissible
and
we
submit
that
these
are
not
the
standards
which
this
court
has
set
down
and
not
the
standards
by
which
a
confession
should
be
reviewed
and
certainly
not
the
standard
of
corroboration.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
judge
never
stated
nor
in
any
other
way
indicated
implicitly
or
explicitly
that
he
had
found
this
confession
to
be
voluntary.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
denied
the
motion
but
if
a
denial
of
the
motion
under
georgia
standards
of
this
sort
is
complied
to
jackson
v.
denno,
jackson
v.
denno
is
meaningless.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
judge
denied
this
and
did
not
make
any
findings
and
did
so
under
a
rule
of
law
that
previously
existed
in
georgia
and
has
been
reaffirmed
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
which
holds
that
a
confession
is
admissible
upon
a
prima
facie
showing
of
admissibility
and
consequently
under
the
georgia
law,
this
judge
held
the
confession
admissible.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct
in
terms
of
what
the
judge
said,
but
in
terms
of
what
he
did,
he
was
here
on
a
record
in
which
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
that
--
what
isaac
sims
said
happened
to
him,
uncontradicted
evidence
isaac
sims
said
happened
to
him,
did
happen.
now,
the
state
supreme
court
then
passing
upon
whether
the
confession
should
have
been
admitted
says
in
effect
that
this
confession
is
admissible
not
upon,
not
necessarily
upon
a
finding
of
voluntariness
which
would
be
jackson
v.
denno,
this
confession
is
admissible
because
there
was
a
prima
facie
showing
the
voluntariness
and
it
says
this
because
at
no
point,
it
disavows
it's
previous
cases
and
in
fact
said
that
its
procedure
is
distinguishable
from
the
procedure
in
jackson
v.
denno
because
it
has
certain
other
rules
of
law.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court,
just
a
word
on
the
jury
point,
there
has
been
--
that
has
been
stated
to
the
court
for
the
first
time,
some
facts
which
certainly
do
not
appear
on
the
record
about
numbers
of
negroes
on
the
panel
and
so
forth
and
on
the
grand
jury
and
we
rest
upon
what
the
record
in
these
case
is.
the
state
certainly
had
within
its
power
to
establish
the
facts
if
they
were
otherwise
at
the
trial
and
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
this
record.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
there
were
nine
--
the
only
information
i
have
mr.
justice
black
is
from
the
record
in
which
five
were
identified
and
now
the
nine
--
i
have
to
dispute
it
because
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
it's
true.
i
went
down
and
i
made
an
independent
count
and
i
might
find
it's
none
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
at
the
very
least
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
to
have
a
further
hearing
on
this.
indeed,
i
just
feel
that
on
this
record,
i
have
to
believe
what
the
record
tells
me
and
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
are
nine.
the
first
we've
heard
about
none
was
at
this
time.
if
there's
any
doubt
about
the
standard
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
used,
i
submit
that
the
court
to
look
at
the
top
of
page
336
of
the
record
on
the
jackson
v.
denno
point.
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
makes
quite
clear
336
that
it
is
adhering
to
its
prior
standard.
it
examines
the
fact
and
says,
the
related
facts
made
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the
statement
was
freely
and
voluntarily
made
and
admissible
into
evidence.
now,
i
don't
know
what
more
one
would
need
to
be
persuaded
that
georgia
is
using
and
it
cites
the
old
cases.
the
jury
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
336.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
first
sentence
and
the
first
full
paragraph
that
georgia
is
using
the
prima
facie
standard
and
not
the
finding
of
voluntary
standard.
and
indeed
on
337,
in
it's
distinguishing
of
the
cases
it
makes
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
finding
that
the
jackson
procedure
was
followed,
but
rather
there
are
reasons
why
it
didn't
have
to
be
followed.
in
the
middle
of
337,
about
a
third
of
the
way
down
the
first
bullet
paragraph,
did
we
think
that
the
jackson
case
applied
to
this
case,
we
would
unhesitatingly
follow
it
which
to
me
contains
an
implication
that
they
are
not
following
it
and
then
they
give
some
reasons
why
they're
not
following
it
and
that
because
georgia
has
some
certain
legal
doctrines
which
make
it
rather
different
than
new
york,
and
so
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
doubt
at
all
that
neither
the
trial
judge
and
certainly
that
state
supreme
court
in
assessing
what
the
trial
judge
did
believe
that
they
were
doing
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
what
jackson
requires.
now,
there
is
some
allegation
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
your
honor
as
i
read
that,
that's
one
of
those
--
sometimes
confusing
statements
one
sees
in
trial
records
--
people
think
on
their
feet
and
he
apparently
said,
“well,
let's
have
a
hearing
and
now,
i
guess
we
had
it
and
i'm
not
sure
we
never
had
it”
and
then
things
just
kind
of
drifted
off
and
i
think
it's
really
not
conclusive
as
to
any
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
yes,
and
then
there
was
an
objection
later
on
and
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
about
jackson
v.
denno.
now,
much
is
made
of
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
was
treated
in
a
friendly
manner
at
the
jail
and
in
fact,
he
had
nothing
to
eat
and
it
was
about
eight
hours
since
he
had
eaten.
he
was
in
what
now
is
uncontradicted.
he
had
to
be
in
extremely
severe
pain
as
a
result
of
what
happened
to
him.
no
one
is
any
longer
denying
that.
the
fact
that
the
jailers
asserted
that
they
treated
him
in
a
friendly
way,
i
think
it
proves
nothing.
this
court
in
the
miranda
case
for
example,
took
note
of
the
so
called
mutt
and
jeff
technique
of
interrogation
in
which
some
people
treat
the
prisoner
in
a
brutal
manner
and
then
some
people
come
up
and
treat
him
in
a
friendly
manner
and
the
friendly
treatment
in
it
of
itself,
we
submit
proves
nothing.
we
submit
that
this
case
is
virtually
to
the
extent
that
you
could
find
two
cases
that
involve
parallel
sets
of
facts
on
all
force
with
fikes
against
alabama.
here,
both
petitioners
were
approximately
the
same
age.
both
had
third
grade
education.
both
were
of
extremely
limited
mentality.
both
were
arrested
by
civilians
to
follow
the
parallel
further.
neither
was
arraigned
or
taken
to
a
magistrate
before
the
confession.
each
of
them
was
allegedly
advised
of
some
legal
rights.
sims
saw
no
friend,
relative
or
counsel,
fikes
saw
his
employer.
the
fikes
record
contains
no
evidence
of
physical
brutality
although
the
fikes
record
did
involve
a
time
period
of
several
days
before
the
confession.
this
record
involved
somewhat
slighter
time
period
but
now
--
but
contained
uncontradicted
evidence
of
physical
brutality
inflicted
on
the
petitioner
shortly
before
the
alleged
confession
and
we
submit
that
the
proper
procedure
was
not
followed
as
required
by
the
jackson
case,
but
then
any
event
on
uncontradicted
evidence
on
this
record,
the
conviction
below
should
be
reversed
because
the
confession
was
coerced
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
cornelius.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
was
part
of
the
same
transaction.
it
was
the
reaffirmation
of
the
original
confession.
this
was
at
or
about
a
time
when
a
warrant
had
been
issued
against
him
and
he
was
as
denoted
in
georgia
law
an
accused
and
he
still
had
no
counsel.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
it
has
any
effect.
i
would
think
that
the
momentum
of
the
conditions
that
led
to
the
first
confession
certainly
carried
on
shortly
thereafter
a
period
of
several
days
thereafter
he
was
brought
back
in
handcuffs
to
folkston
where
the
crime
has
supposed
to
have
occurred.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
that
it
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
that
by
a
week
later,
he
certainly
should
have
had
counsel,
friends
or
someone
advising
him
or
assisting
him.
by
this
time,
a
warrant
had
been
issued
against
him.
some
of
the
protections
are
suggested
or
required
by
the
messiah
case
for
example
should
have
been
made
available
to
him
and
--
but
in
any
event,
there
are
numerous
cases
in
this
court
in
which
the
defendants
give
a
whole
series
of
confessions
and
this
court
has
held
upon
a
finding
that
one
of
them
was
coerced
that
it
was
adequate
grounds
for
reversal.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
we
do
your
honor
but
it
would
be
rather
simple
to
supply
them
because
there
are
a
number
of
--
i'll
check
it
again.
i
can't
recall
it
at
the
moment
but
if
not
we
will
submit
it
to
the
court.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
i
add
just
one
point
you
honor
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
statement
made
that
prior
to
jackson
v.
denno,
there
had
not
been
these
pre-trial
hearings
on
the
confession
and
the
counsel
in
georgia
informs
me
that
this
is
not
the
case
that
mr.
moore
himself
for
many
years
before
jackson
v.
denno
would
try
the
confession
issue
separately
under
the
old
georgia
rule
before
the
trial.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
is
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
following
the
second
trial
of
petitioner,
isaac
sims,
a
negro,
who
was
convicted
on
both
occasions
of
the
alleged
rape
of
a
white
woman
in
charlton
county,
georgia
in
april
1963.
following
the
first
trial,
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
his
court
appointed
counsel
took
no
appeal
shortly
before
the
date
of
execution
one
of
the
present
counsel
on
the
case
was
engaged
by
sentence,
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
secured
a
reversal
of
the
conviction
on
the
ground
that
inadequate
representation
of
counsel.
the
second
trial
was
held
on
october
7,
1964,
petitioner
sims
was
re-indicted
on
october
6,
the
day
before
the
second
trial
commenced.
he
was
found
guilty
once
more
and
sentenced
to
death
on
october
8,
1964.
this
case
presents
two
categories
of
issues
to
the
court.
the
first
involved
discriminations
selection
of
grand
and
petty
juries
which
we
claim
was
conducted
contrary
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
second
involves
various
issues
revolving
around
in
alleged
confession.
we
submit
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
i
would
submit
if
any
of
our
points
were
good,
you
would
not
have
to
reach
any
of
the
other
of
the
points.
we
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
georgia
court
didn't
--
that's
what
i
read
them
as
having
said
but
their
language
--
it
was
not
precisely
that
their
language
was
they
denounced
the
decision
as
illogical,
impracticable,
something
to
create
chaos
and
so
forth.
they
said,
we
didn't
do
what
jackson
requires
but
this
is
distinguishable
because
georgia
has
three
rules
of
law
that
new
york
didn't
have
and
so
this
is
rather
different.
beside
they
said
there
was
no
factual
issue
involved
and
we
claim
that
there
was
indeed
a
factual
issue
and
if
anything
the
factual
issue
should
be
resolved
in
the
ground
that
this
confession
was
coerced
as
matter
of
law
as
i
hope
to
be
able
to
demonstrate.
on
the
confession
issue,
we
claim
first
of
all
that
the
confession
was
secured
by
means
which
is
a
matter
of
law
are
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
secondly
this
confession
was
appraised
by
the
state
courts
according
to
standards
not
inconformity
with
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
finally
was
received
in
evidence
according
to
procedures
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
like
to
first
discuss
the
jury
question.
on
pages
three
to
four
of
the
record,
there
is
a
clean
abatement
which
attacks
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury.
it
alleges
that
there
has
been
over
period
of
years
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes,
that
the
grand
jury
is
selected
from
the
tax
digest
that
many
negroes'
names
appear
on
the
tax
digest
and
many
negroes
in
the
community
are
upright
and
intelligent
citizens,
that
over
period
of
10
years,
virtually
no
negroes
have
served
on
the
grand
jury,
that
there
has
been
none
as
jury
commissioners
are
and
that
the
tax
digest
are
kept
on
basis
of
race
indicating
who's
colored
and
who's
white
in
the
very
book
which
is
the
source
of
the
grand
jurors.
the
clean
abatement
also
alleged
that
there
was
neither
notice
nor
reasonable
opportunity
to
petitioner
to
challenge
the
array
of
the
grand
jury
prior
to
the
time
of
the
return
of
the
indictment
which
took
petitioner
by
surprise.
petitioner
supposed
that
he
was
going
to
be
try
on
the
first
indictment
and
the
trial
was
set
for
the
seventh,
he
walked
into
court
was
still
down
to
six,
he'd
been
re-indicted
by
another
grand
jury.
there
was
also
a
challenged
to
the
array
of
the
traverse
jury
and
that
appears
in
the
record,
pages
68
and
it
claimed
that
there
was
a
system
of
selection
whereby
negroes
who
excluded
and
included
on
the
basis
of
race
and
that
negroes
selected
negroes
who
might
have
served
down
traverse
jury
was
systematically
struck
from
service
on
the
basis
of
race
and
then
there
were
some
additional
charges
which
similar
to
those
made
in
connection
with
the
grand
jury.
now,
petitioner
will
not
elaborate
on
what
the
law
is
that
governs
the
jury
question
because
it
is
familiar
to
this
court
and
has
been
argued
at
least
several
times
each
term
but
in
the
phrase,
it
is
that
a
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
members
of
his
own
race,
on
a
panel
or
on
a
jury
which
tries
him.
he's
merely
entitled
not
to
have
them
systematically
excluded
and
the
way
this
issue
has
been
tried
in
case
after
case
has
been
to
look
at
the
history
and
see
what
has
been
the
method
of
selection
of
the
jury,
what
have
been
the
results
and
what
kind
of
a
judgment
can
you
make
from
these
facts
and
that
would
be
particularly
appropriate
in
this
case
because
even
though
petitioners
was
re-indicted
a
day
before
his
trial
but
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
method
of
selection
on
the
new
indictment
is
any
different
from
the
method
of
selection
that
has
been
used
over
all
the
years
in
the
past
and
indeed
to
extent
of
the
record
indicates
it,
it
is
the
same
method
of
selection
and
does
rely
upon
the
tax
digest
which
are
divided
on
the
basis
of
race
and
white
person's
name
or
in
white
pages
and
negro
person's
name
are
on
yellow
pages.
mr.
jack
greenberg
why
was
he
re-indicted?
it
doesn't
appear.
the
only
possible
reason
one
might
imagine
is
that
to
secure
a
new
grand
jury
in
order
to
do
it
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
this
grand
jury
was
selected
by
any
different
method
than
any
of
previous
grand
jurors
but
there
is
--
the
second
indictment
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
first
indictment.
since
was
the
21
--
it
seems
didn't
know
was
on
may
to
which
is
part
of
our
charge
on
the
confession
point
that
he
is
so
ignored
he
wasn't
--
didn't
know
was
on
his
but
at
the
time
of
trial
he
was
either
27
or
29.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
second
trial
was
two
years
after
the
alleged
incident.
no,
one
year
after
the
allegiance
in
the
'60
--
october,
1964
and
the
alleged
incident
was
in
april
1963.
at
the
out
set
of
the
hearing
on
the
jury
point,
petitioner
offered
in
to
evidence
the
certified
register
of
the
jury
list
of
the
previous
10
years
and
this
was
the
very
first
thing
that
he
did.
and
this
obviously
was
a
prelude
to
an
examination
concerning
the
pattern
of
jury
selection.
this
has
occurred
as
i
said
on
numerous
cases.
in
page
50
of
our
brief,
we
cite
perhaps
the
half
page
full
of
citations
of
cases
in
which
this
and
other
courts
have
looked
to
the
practices
of
years
passed
in
order
to
make
a
judgment
on
this
point.
there
was
an
objection,
the
counsel
for
the
state
said,
“i
mean
to
object
that
any
list
of
any
grand
jury
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
present
grand
jury
or
petty
jury
and
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
particular
grand
jury
or
petty
jury.”
and
the
court
said,
“i
am
the
opinion
that
would
be
right.”
the
objections
were
sustained
and
so
as
to
leave
no
doubt
whatsoever
about
the
grounds
of
sustaining
them,
the
grounds
of
the
ruling
on
the
state
supreme
court,
we
find
on
page
331
of
the
record
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
court
properly
excluded
jury
lists
for
prior
years.
they
would
not
be
relevant
in
the
face
of
a
showing
that
no
discrimination
existed
in
the
composition
of
the
present
juries.
so,
the
holding
below
and
both
the
trial
and
the
appellate
courts
were
that
petitioner
would
not
be
permitte
to
demonstrate
what
the
pattern
of
selection
had
been
over
the
past
leading-up
into
the
present.
and
we
submit
that
on
this
ground
alone
and
we
will
discussed
the
method
of
selection,
the
yellow
and
white
pages
in
a
moment
but
in
this
ground
of
alone
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
carter
against
texas
and
the
decision
of
a
term
or
two
go
in
coleman
against
alabama
that
is
reversible
error
in
and
of
itself
for
this
petitioner
at
a
minimum
has
a
right
to
prove
his
case
and
his
case
consists
of
demonstrating
what
the
method
of
selection
is
and
what
kind
of
juries
this
method
produces
and
he
wasn't
permitted
to
do
that.
now,
on
this
grand
jury,
we
do
know
that
if
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
petitioner,
there
was
a
stipulation
that
there
was
a
single
negro
and
we
do
know
that
on
the
petty
jury
array
of
99,
there
were
five
negroes
and
if
we
put
together
the
names
of
the
negroes
alongside
the
list
of
strikes
which
appear
on
page
19
to
21
of
the
record,
we
also
know
that
three
negroes
were
struck
by
the
state
and
two
negroes
were
never
reached,
so
all
five
negroes
were
disposed
of.
now,
we
submit
that
if
we
could
demonstrate
--
forbidden
to
demonstrate,
if
this
have
been
the
pattern
of
the
past
10
years
or
less
over
period
of
many
years
at
all
that
there
have
been
no
more
representation
in
this,
so
perhaps
less
representation
on
this,
there
would
be
clear
grounds
reversal
but
petitioner
was
never
permitted
to
show
anything
about
the
previous
years
and
all
we
have
is
the
--
this
bid
of
evidence
about
the
single
year
which
in
and
on
of
itself
is
a
suspicious
to
the
point
of
i
think
indicating
to
a
certainty
that
something
was
a
missed
in
the
method
of
selection
in
so
far
as
securing
adequate
representation
without
regard
to
race.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
have
those
statistics
here
mr.
chief
justice.
the
white
population
over
age
21
on
the
county
was
1,928
and
the
non-white
population
over
21
was
728.
now,
the
jurors
were
selected
from
the
tax
digest
and
the
white
taxpayers
in
the
county
were
1,548
and
the
negro
taxpayers
were
411.
mr.
jack
greenberg
charlton
county,
georgia.
now,
the
method
of
selection
that
was
employed,
we
submit,
is
unconstitutional
per
se
but
certainly
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
small
representation
that
petitioner
was
permitted
to
show
and
the
refusal
to
permit
him
to
demonstrate
whether
the
representation
have
been
the
same
or
perhaps
less
in
the
past
adds
up
to
a
reversible
error.
now,
the
commissioner
and
here's
the
way
the
jury
was
made
up,
the
commissioners
testified
or
a
commissioner
testified
that
they
went
through
the
tax
digest
list
so
these
are
two
books,
one
book
for
negroes,
one
book
for
whites,
the
book
for
whites
raving
there
were
in
single
volume
but
the
pages
for
whites
were
white,
the
pages
of
negroes
were
yellow.
the
commissioner
went
through
the
white
pages
alphabetically
a
to
z
and
they
said
around
the
table
and
somebody
said
john
jones
and
somebody
said,
i
know
him,
he's
pretty
good
and
there
were
another
names
that
i'm
hope
so
and
so
and
say,
let's
not
take
him
and
they
didn't
take
him,
went
to
this
informal
manner.
when
they
got
all
through
with
the
white
names
they
then
took
up
the
negro
names
and
so
at
the
very
outset
there
was
a
method
of
selection
which
intrudes
thrust
under
the
very
knows
of
the
jury
commissioners,
the
consideration
of
race
then
these
names
are
put
on
the
box
and
the
judge
selects
from
the
box
in
appropriate
number
of
a
grand
and
petty
jurors
and
a
proportion
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
just
suppose
to
reach
and
pull
their
names
out,
i
mean
i
–-
this
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
a
way,
but
yes
they're
in
put
together
indiscriminately.
they're
on
the
same
colored
paper
and
you
no
longer
have
yellow
and
white
paper
and
that
the
judge
then
selects
as
in
this
case
99
for
the
petty
jury
array
and
then
counsel
select
the
jury
from
that
array.
now,
we
claim
first
of
all
that
the
very
outset
the
method
of
selection
is
infected
with
racial
consideration.
this
court
has
held
in
hamm
against
virginia
that
the
maintenance
of
tax
list
on
these
basis,
there
is
no
jury
question
involved
in
that
case
but
the
maintenance
of
tax
list
on
this
basis
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
a
case
that
is
very
much
in
point
we
submit
is
anderson
against
morton,
the
louisiana
case
which
said
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
place
the
race
of
a
candidate
next
to
his
name
on
a
ballot
and
the
reason
that
is
unconstitutional
is
that
at
the
last
moment
before
the
voter
makes
his
choice
the
state
thrust
under
his
nose
the
racial
consideration.
it's
the
only
thing
that
the
state
tells
him
at
that
point
and
the
court
held
that
this
was
impermissible
combination
of
private
and
public
action
that
while
you
could
not
stop
voters
from
knowing
what
the
race
of
the
candidates
would
be
and
in
fact
in
most
cases
they
would
be
expected
to
know
and
no
way
certainly
couldn't
read
their
minds,
you
know
why
they
voted
for
candidates
in
some
instances
they
might
vote
for
him
on
a
basis
of
race
or
might
vote
against
him
on
a
basis
race.
nevertheless,
for
the
states
to
inject
the
racial
consideration
that
thrust
forward
at
that
point
was
impermissible.
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
farfetched
analogy
to
say
that
what
the
jury
commissioners
at
this
point
are
doing
is
electing
juror.
they're
going
to
the
list
and
the
one
piece
of
written
information,
the
one
thing
on
the
face
of
the
documents
from
which
they
are
making
the
selection
is
the
yellow
one
and
white
pages
and
in
fact,
it's
done
in
a
way
which
almost
invites
setting
up
some
sort
of
proportion
because
when
they
get
all
of
a
group
the
white
pages
then
sort
of
placed
in
a
position
where
they
have
to
save
themselves.
well,
how
many
negroes
shall
we
choose
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
have?
mr.
jack
greenberg
of
the
--
and
petty
jury
array
in
this
case,
there
were
99,
i
don't
know
–
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
information
isn't
available,
mr.
justice
harlan
but
we
do
now
that
the
array
was
presumably
chosen
out
of
the
box
by
fair
selection
process
just
totally
by
chance
so
far
as
anyone
can
tell
produced
five
negroes
out
of
99.
now,
in
a
case
that
involved
the
colors
yellow
and
white
corresponding
to
negro
and
white,
avery
against
georgia,
we
had
a
situation
in
which
there
were
yellow
and
white
tickets
in
the
jury
box
and
it
had
not
been
established
that
anyone
did
use
these
yellow
and
white
tickets
for
an
invidious
racial
purpose.
it
wasn't
known.
one
of
the
concurring
opinions
pointed
out,
that
it
might
have
been
possible
peek
into
the
box
but
nobody
did
know
that
anyone
actually
had
peeked
into
it
but
the
opportunity
for
discrimination
which
the
use
of
yellow
and
white
tickets
presented
plus
the
fact
of
this
proportionately
small
representation
was
held
by
this
court
to
warrant
a
reversal
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
submit
that
this
case
is
even
stronger
than
avery
against
georgia
because
we
do
know
that
the
jury
commissioners
in
selecting
the
jury
did
know
who
is
negro
and
who
was
white
as
a
result
of
looking
at
the
yellow
and
white
pages.
and
in
fact,
while
we
have
a
very
small
proportion
on
the
base
of
the
information
that's
now
possessed
by
us,
we
were
precluded
from
demonstrating
in
fact
what
the
proportion
actually
was.
so,
we
submit
that
on
uncontradicted
evidence
out
the
mouth
of
the
jury
commissioners
and
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
georgia,
we
have
a
situation
here
in
which
the
jury
was
selected
in
a
manner
who
are
not
permitted
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
i
now
like
to
argue
the
second
portion
of
our
argument
and
that
relates
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
and
evidence,
the
standards
by
which
it
was
committed
in
evidence,
the
standards
by
which
it
was
praised.
petitioner
contends
that
the
process
followed
below
violates
principles
declared
by
this
court
in
jackson
against
denno
and
if
we
turn
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
we'll
find
a
number
of
things
that
the
state
supreme
court
had
to
say
about
jackson
against
denno
though
with
made
no
effort
to
demonstrate,
it
was
in
compliance
but
only
to
distinguish
it.
it
said
that
the
jackson
decision
is
illogical,
impracticable
and
utterly
unsound.
it
said
that
we
hope
the
present
justices
will
after
more
mature
consideration
overrule
jackson
against
denno.
said,
of
jackson
against
denno,
that
an
alarming
injustice
is
being
unintentionally
forced
upon
american
courts
and
having
said
this
that
proceeded
to
distinguish
this
case
in
jackson
against
denno
while
they
said
at
no
point
ever
asserting
that
it
had
in
fact
follow
the
jackson
against
denno
procedure.
now,
before
considering
all
of
the
distinctions
on
which
the
decision
of
the
georgia
court
purports
to
rest,
i
should
like
to
for
a
moment
to
discuss
one
of
them
that
is
on
page
339
of
the
record
in
the
opinion
of
the
states
supreme
court.
it
stated,
there
was
no
evidence
to
make
any
issue
of
voluntariness.
without
an
issue,
there
is
nothing
to
try.
now,
we
submit
however
that
not
only
is
there
an
issue
of
voluntariness
that
this
issue
in
voluntariness
on
uncontradicted
testimony
on
this
record.
testimony
such
of
this
court
has
considered
in
other
confession
cases
that
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
record
there
can
only
be
one
determination
and
that
is
–-
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
at
what
point
i
would
draw
the
line,
but
i
would
say
certainly
within
the
matters
after
–-
within
matter
of
hours
after
the
events
in
the
doctor's
office,
there
would
be
no
doubt
about
it.
he
stated
he
was
in
pain
for
period
of
several
weeks
thereafter
and
i
think
that's
quite
believable
given
the
uncontradicted
testimony
and
what
had
happened
to
him.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
not
alone
but
if
you
take
this
extreme
pain
and
had
been
afflicted
upon
him
by
somewhat
to
whom
the
police
had
brought
him
as
part
of
the
process
of
investigation
that
this
man
cannot
read
or
write,
he
graduated
from
the
third
grade
if
you
may
call
it
graduated
at
age
17
or
18,
doesn't
even
know
his
own
age,
doesn't
know
when
his
father
died,
totally
ignorant.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
he
said
the
sheriff
scolded
him
and
i
would
think
that
having
been
through
the
experience
he
was
through
just
several
hours
earlier.
he
was
probably
not
in
any
position
to
think
even
as
clearly
as
he
might
that
is
clearest.
we
like
to
--
in
introducing
the
confession
point
just
state
who
this
petitioner
is
and
i
said
a
word
or
two
about
it,
he's
indigent,
he's
ignorant,
finished
the
third
grade
at
age
17
or
18,
he's
illiterate,
can't
read
or
write.
he
can
write
his
name
as
he
says
pretty
good
but
that's
all.
wasn't
quite
certain
what
his
own
age
is,
his
father,
mother
or
daddy
didn't
know
when
his
father
died.
there
were
some
elaborate
recitations
in
the
confession
he
suppose
to
have
given
there
were
written
into
it
which
were
they
later
admitted
that
he
hadn't
given
that
they
wrote
in
all
in
their
own
but
to
many
simply
words
in
there
words
that
even
many
illiterates
might
be
expected
to
understand,
he
didn't
understand.
i
think
this
testimony
all
rings
through,
“isaac,
do
you
know
what
freely
and
voluntarily
means?”
“i
beg
your
pardon?”
“do
you
know
what
freely
and
voluntarily
means?"
“freely
and
voluntarily?”
“voluntarily.”
“no,
sir
i
do
not.”
“do
you
know
what
is
meant
by
the
statement
can
be
used
against
you
in
court?”
“statement
can
be
used
against
me?”
“statement
can
be
used
against
you
in
court,
do
you
know
what
that
means?”
“no
sir.”
“do
you
know
what
it
means
to
be
informed
of
your
legal
rights?”
“well,
that's
like
being
good
or
something?”
“is
that
what
means
to
you,
isaac?”
“yes
sir.”
and
this
goes
on
for
a
several
pages.
there's
one
page,
on
page
141,
he
is
--
page
144
rather,
he's
asked,
“do
you
know
what
normal
and
ordinary
mean,
isaac,”
which
i
submit
that
many
illiterate
understand
like
you're
sick
or
something,
is
that
would
have
means
to
you?
“i
imagine
so,
yes
sir.”
so
this
is
the
man
that
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
argument
concluded
yesterday,
i
was
discussing
the
confession
issue
and
had
just
completed
describing
the
background
and
the
–
what
this
petitioner
is
like
which
is
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
examines
in
going
to
the
question
of
whether
a
confession
is
coerced
and
i
was
doing
that
in
connection
with
the
state
supreme
court’s
treatment
of
jackson
v.
denno
and
in
which
the
state
supreme
court
said
among
other
things
in
distinguishing
jackson
v.
denno
from
this
case
that
there
was
no
issue
of
voluntariness
to
be
tried
and
we
submit
that
in
the
contrary
that
there
was
indeed
an
issue
and
that
that
issue
could
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
on
uncontradicted
testimony.
i
pointed
out
that
this
petitioner
was
indigent.
he
was
ignorant
that
he
finished
the
third
grade
only
at
age
17
or
18
that
he
could
not
read
or
write
except
his
name
and
he
didn't
know
the
year
that
he
was
born.
he
knew
that
his
father
was
dead
and
did
not
know
when
he'd
died
and
so
forth
and
i've
read
from
the
record
colloquy
with
the
petitioner
which
indicated
his
inability
to
understand
even
ordinary
common
phrases
including
a
good
number
that
had
been
attributed
to
him
in
the
so
called
confession.
now,
this
is
the
man
of
whom
we're
talking
and
i
now
like
to
say
what
happened
to
him
and
shortly
following
arrest,
he
was
taken
to
the
office
of
dr.
jackson
for
examination
and
his
alleged
statement
said
that
there
were
bloodstains
on
his
clothing
and
dr.
jackson
helped
remove
this
clothing
from
him.
there
is
some
dispute
about
the
vigor
with
which
dr.
jackson
did
this
but
no
dispute
at
all
that
dr.
jackson
played
a
part
in
removing
his
clothing.
he
was
brought
there
by
state
police
and
there
were
seven
or
eight
state
troopers
on
the
premises
at
that
time
and
they
were
in
uniform
wearing
guns
and
i'd
now
like
to
read
a
few
lines
from
the
record.
question,
“what
happened
to
you
isaac?”
“well,
dr.
jackson
some
one
knocked
me
down
and
kick
me
over
my
eyelid
and
busted
my
eye
on
the
right
side.”
“did
anything
else
happen
to
you?”
“and
he
grabbed
me
by
my
private
and
dragged
me
on
the
floor.”
“did
he
drag
you
by
your
private
on
the
floor?”
“yes
sir.”
“did
it
hurt
you
a
lot?”
“yes
sir,
pretty
bad.”
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
particular
statement
is
never
contradicted
and
was
never
gone
into
cross-examination
and
it
was
something
that
was
repeated
at
a
subsequent
state
of
the
proceedings
later
on
in
the
record.
neither
jackson
or
any
of
the
seven
or
eight
police
officers
who
are
present
and
presumably
were
available
to
the
state
and
indeed
dr.
jackson
testified,
he
was
available
to
the
state
beyond
doubt,
ever
contradicted
with
this
particular
charge.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
denied
some
aspects
of
what,
i'd
like
to
go
into
his
testimony
in
a
moment,
denied
some
aspects
of
what
sims
said
and
i
submit
in
a
very
equivocal
way
but
never
discussed
this
particular
aspect
of
it
and
this
was
subsequent
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
urging
both
mr.
justice
white.
i
say
that
they
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i
plan
to
discuss
it
in
a
moment.
if
you
like
i
could
do
it
right
now.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
some
of
it
came
up
during
the
trial
also.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
just
said,
i
deny.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
that
there
is
with
some
diffidence
that
i
would
say
there's
noncompliance
with
jackson
v.
denno.
as
i
understand
jackson
v.
denno,
it
requires
some
sort
of
a
finding
of
voluntariness
and
there
was
no
finding.
if
we
are
to
read
the
georgia
cases
and
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court,
georgia
has
persisted
in
following
the
law
that
it
had
followed
prior
to
jackson
v.
denno
which
is
admissibility
upon
prima
facie
killer.
mr.
jack
greenberg
or
have
no
doubt.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
standard
which
the
court
applied
was
that
it
admitted
the
evidence
upon
a
prima
facie
showing
of
voluntariness
and
that
prima
facie
showing
consisted
of
responses
to
the
so
called
statutory
questions
which
is
a
few
pro
forma
questions,
was
he
threatened,
was
he
put
into
fear?
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
judge
himself
–
the
judge
himself
does
not
state
the
standard
he
applies
but
all
of
the
georgia
cases
are
compatible
with
what
the
judge
did
and
that
is
just
merely
admit
the
testimony
upon
a
prima
facie
showing.
now
the
judge
didn't
give
a
charge
to
the
jury
on
what
the
standard
of
admissibility
should
be
for
the
jury
and
that
is
once
more
the
traditional
pre
jackson
v.
denno,
georgia
charge
–
that's
in
page
3
–-
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
the
procedure
involves
certain
standards,
whether
or
not
the
testimony
should
be
admitted
upon
finding
a
voluntariness
or
whether
or
not
the
testimony
should
be
admitted
upon
a
prima
facie
showing
even
though
there
might
be
a
conflict
of
the
evidence
in
which
evidence
of
course
might
in
fact
be
overwhelming.
on
page
312
of
the
record
of
the
charge,
the
jury
and
that
of
--
is
an
indication
of
the
standard
of
admissibility
which
the
trial
judge
used,
but
the
state
supreme
court
opinion
does
not
indicate
for
a
moment
and
neither
does
brief
of
the
state.
mr.
jack
greenberg
to
make
a
confession
admissible,
it
must
have
been
made
freely
and
voluntarily
without
being
induced
by
another
by
the
slightest
hope
of
benefit
with
a
remotest
fear
of
injury.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
the
court
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
to
the
extent
that
that's
an
indication
of
what
the
court
had
in
his
mind
which
nowhere
he
indicated.
we
think
that
that
does
not
embody
the
standards
which
this
court
has
set
down
on
rogers
v.
richmond
and
wan
versus
united
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
does
not
take
into
account
for
example
who
this
petitioner
was
and
entire
background
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
confession.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
doesn't
exclude
them
but
it
does
not
point
out
that
there
are
certain
essential
elements
of
the
confession,
circumstances
surrounding
the
confession
which
this
court
described
in
some
detail
on
rogers
v.
richmond
and
wan
versus
united
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
the
jury
should
believe
that
a
confession
was
induced
by
another
--
by
the
slightest
hope
of
benefit
or
the
remotest
fear
of
injury
then
in
that
event
so
forth.
we
submit
that
nevertheless
that
does
not
take
into
account,
the
total
surrounding
circumstances,
who
this
petitioner
was,
his
ignorance,
his
lack
of
education,
there's
no
counsel
present,
he
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
make
a
telephone
call
and
so
forth.
but
i
think
that
the
key
--
the
essential
holding
of
the
state
supreme
court
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
what
the
prior
georgia
law
is,
which
is
at
no
point
repudiated,
at
no
point
amended
and
indeed
reasserted
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
cases
are
cited,
the
jackson
v.
denno
standard
is
denounced,
the
brief
of
the
state
reasserts
that
the
prior
law
is
essentially
still
in
effect
but
they
say
that
jackson
v.
denno
would
not
to
apply
to
this
case
because
georgia
law
is
different
than
new
york
law
and
they
purport
to
distinguish
georgia
law
from
new
york
law
in
three
essentials
on
page
337
of
the
record.
when
we
read
that
opinion,
we
note
a
total
absence
of
any
consideration
therein
of
the
georgia
statute
which
provides
that
a
conviction
cannot
rest
upon
a
confession
alone
but
the
confession
must
be
collaborated.
now
the
requirement
of
collaboration
was
also
present
in
new
york
law
at
the
time
jackson
was
decided.
they
purport
to
distinguish
the
georgia
cases
from
the
new
york
cases
on
the
ground.
this
court
did
not
take
into
account
in
jackson
v.
denno,
a
georgia
statute
requiring
as
an
indispensable
foundation
to
the
introduction
of
an
alleged
confession,
a
showing
that
was
freely
and
voluntarily
made
and
that
it
was
not
induced
by
another
by
the
slightest
fear
of
punishment
or
the
remotest
of
reward
and
that
was
also
to
new
york.
or
of
georgia
law
investing
the
trial
judge
with
unquestionable
power
to
review
the
case
after
conviction
and
to
set
the
verdict
aside
if
he
is
not
satisfied
with
it
and
that's
also
true
new
york
--
corroboration
point
as
well
--
i
might
point
out
to
the
corroboration
point
that
there
is
some
serious
doubt
whether
there
is
any
corroboration
in
the
sense
that
was
required
in
the
charge
of
the
jury
of
linking
this
petitioner
with
the
crime.
for
example,
the
clothing
was
taken
from
him
and
it's
never
been
heard
from
since,
but
that
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
fortas
because
this
court
is
held
in
a
number
of
cases
that
if
an
involuntary
confession
is
admitted
into
evidence,
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
be
other
evidence
which
would
tend
to
sustain
a
conviction
or
corroborate
the
confession,
does
not
save
the
judgment
from
being
reversed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
was.
there's
some
evidence
to
establish
at
the
first
trial
and
they've
never
testified
anything
in
this
sort
but
nevertheless
they
did
in
this
occasion.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that's
correct
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
this
court
and
well,
it's
undisputed
except
in
the
sense
the
petitioner
denied
having
committed
a
crime
but
i
think
this
court
in
many
cases,
at
least
in
a
number
of
cases,
has
considered
a
series
of
confessions
some
of
which
were
objected
to
and
some
of
which
weren't.
and
when
the
court
has
found
that
one
of
the
confessions
is
involuntary
and
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
standards,
the
conviction
has
been
reversed
and
so,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
save
the
judgment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
now,
of
course
what
the
court
did
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
georgia
law,
if
the
georgia
law
was
such
that
the
judge
could
admit
it
only
if
he
found
it
voluntary,
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
we
would
hang
off
on
the
particular
verbal
formulation
that
the
judge
used.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
jackson
v.
denno
was
june
22nd.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
in
fact,
there
was
a
reference
to
the
decision
of
this
court
of
june
22nd.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
so
--
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
state
supreme
court
thought
so.
i
think
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
i
think
the
state
supreme
--
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
some
indication.
best
of
all
of
course,
i
think
there
would
be
something
explicit
and
even.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
imagine
that
that
might
be
expressed
in
a
variety
of
ways
but
it
has
to
be
expressed
in
some
way
and
certainly
if
he
had
made
the
tale
findings,
that
would
be
unexceptionable.
but
he
just
said,
i
deny
the
motion.
should
i
deny
the
motion
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
--
i
would
think
that
might
be
enough
if
the
law
of
the
state
and
the
state
supreme
court
indicated
that
that
meant
--
that
there
was
a
finding
and
it
was
voluntary.
but
the
law
of
the
state
is
not
that
at
all.
the
law
of
the
state
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
it's
a
proper
assumption
in
the
light
of
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court
which
says
that
we
are
not
following
jackson
v.
denno
because
our
--
we
have
a
number
of
provisions
in
georgia
law
which
distinguish
our
case
from
jackson
v.
denno.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
they
said
it
wasn't
applicable
to
the
case
but
there's
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
they
said
it
wasn't
--
they
said
it
wasn't
applicable
for
several
reasons.
first,
they
said
that
there
was
no
conflict
of
testimony.
they
said
that
this
confession
was
clearly
voluntary.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
secondly,
they
said
that
georgia
requires
a
prima
facie
showing,
requires
corroboration
and
the
judge
--
and
a
motion
for
new
trial
can
overrule
the
verdict.
and
a
view
of
that
they
said,
we
don't
have
to
do
what
jackson
v.
denno
says
you
have
to
do
because
we're
in
a
different
kind
of
situation
but
actually
georgia
tend
to
see
the
jackson
v.
denno.
georgia
is
in
the
new
york
category.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
you
find
that
the
georgia
trial
court
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
indeed
complied
with
the
jackson
v.
denno
then
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
the
trial
just
complied
with
jackson
v.
denno
then
i
don't
think
you
could
reverse
on
jackson
v.
denno
and
if
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct
but
i
think
what
the
state
supreme
court
says
sheds
light
on
whether
he
did
or
did
not
comply
with
jackson
v.
denno.
but
even
if
you
didn't
find
that,
i
would
think
that
on
the
uncontradicted
evidence
of
what
happened
to
this
petitioner
under
these
circumstances,
i
would
submit
that
the
court
--
the
court
should
advice
whether
there
were
or
were
not
a
jackson
v.
denno
under
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right,
yes.
i
was
describing
the
uncontradicted
testimony
of
what
had
occurred
in
dr.
jackson's
office
and
i
might
--
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
do
go
into
the
types
of
denials
and
whether
or
not
there
is
contradiction
in
the
evidence,
and
i
think
it's
useful
to
look
at
what
the
testimony
of
dr.
jackson
was
here
because
i
think
his
testimony
carries
with
it
at
certain
unequivocal
indication
of
what
happened
in
this
office
even
though
it
could
be
able
to
count
in
terms
of
denials.
he
was
asked
who
put
--
how
did
sims
get
to
cut
over
his
eye
in
relating
to
sims'
charge
that
dr.
jackson
kicked
him
in
the
office
and
dr.
jackson
says,
“i
don't
know
who
put
it
there.”
and
he
was
asked
if
the
officers
did
and
he
said,
“you'll
have
to
ask
the
officers.”
“i'm
asking
you
dr.
jackson.
i'm
asking
you
whether
or
not
the
officers
were
beating
the
defendant.”
answer,
“i
will
say
that
i
wasn't
there
all
the
time.”
“he
didn't
have
the
cut
over
his
eye
when
he
came
into
your
office,
did
he?”
“i
didn't
see
him
until
after
he
got
in.”
“and
when
you
first
saw
him
in
your
office,
he
didn't
have
it?”
“i
couldn't
see
it.
he
was
sort
of
slumped
over
sort
of
falling
around
like
--
anything
could
have
happened
to
him.”
this
is
what
the
doctor
says
about
what
happened
in
the
office.
“was
sims
kicked?”
“i
don't
know
that
he
was.
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
knocked
down
or
fell
down.”
“did
you
find
him
on
the
floor?
”and
he
says,
“well,
sims
just
sort
of
fell
on
the
floor.”
“he
sort
of
fell?
where
were
you
standing
of
the
time
he
sort
of
fell?”
“i
was
standing
on
my
feet.”
“were
you
standing
near
him?”
“very
close.”
“were
you
standing
as
close
as
i
am
to
you
or
closer?”
“probably
a
little
closer.”
“where
you
could
touch
him?”
“i
think
he
could
touch
me.”
“and
you
could
touch
him?”
“yes.”
but
through
all
these
--
and
dr.
jackson's
--
dr.
jackson's
testimony
throughout
the
trial,
even
though
he
was
equivocal
on
this
and
i
submit
that
this
equivocation
indicates
something,
nevertheless,
even
using
the
standard
that
this
court
has
in
case
that
requires
uncontradicted
testimony,
there
is
no
testimony
at
all
that
sims
was
dragged
around
the
room
by
his
genitals,
and
i
think
very
instructive
that
when
the
solicitor
was
cross
examining
sims
on
what
occurred
to
him
that
day,
he
asserted
very
rapidly
around
what
happened
in
dr.
jackson's
office.
he
went
through
that
day
step
by
step
by
step
but
dr.
jackson's
office
was
sort
of
sandwiched
into
a
sentence
and
he
went
from
toledo
to
waycross
and
there
was
no
examination
of
that
even
on
cross-examination.
now,
we
submit
that
in
the
pikes
(ph)
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
a
standard
and
we
feel
should
apply
to
this
case.
there
is
quote
on
page
37
of
our
brief,
which
is
that,
it
is
common
ground
that
if
this
record
had
disclosed
an
admission
by
the
police
of
one
truncheon
blow
on
the
head
of
the
petitioner,
a
confession
following
such
a
blow
would
be
inadmissible.
in
the
stein
case,
quote
in
the
brief
also,
essentially,
the
same
standard
of
state.
its
slight
evident,
even
inquisitive
testimony
that
defendants
injury
occurred
during
the
period
of
detention
or
at
the
hands
of
the
police
or
failure
by
the
prosecution's
to
meet
the
charge
with
all
the
reasonably
available
evidence
might
well
have
tipped
the
scales
of
decision
below.
he
even
hear
it
without
force
if
there
were
any
evidence
whatever
to
connect
the
admitted
injuries
with
the
event
of
a
period
of
interrogation
but
there
is
no
such
word
in
the
record.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
that
on
the
jackson
v.
denno
point
that
sims'
charge
and
sims'
statement
about
what
happened
to
him
in
the
office
at
the
pretrial
hearing
was
at
no
point
contradicted.
so
far
as
the
evidence
on
that
is
concerned
on
the
pretrial
hearing
when
the
trial
judge
ruled,
all
he
had
was
sims'
testimony
about
being
kicked
and
dragged
around
the
floor
in
the
doctor's
office
and
at
that
point,
we
didn't
even
have
dr.
jackson's
testimony
in
denial.
dr.
jackson
testified
for
the
first
time
on
these
questions
during
the
trial.
now,
the
state
supreme
court
as
i
pointed
out
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that's
the
testimony
i
was
describing.
that
is
dr.
jackson's
only
testimony
about
what
occurred
in
his
office.
did
the
police
said
--
you'll
have
to
ask
the
police,
i
wasn't
in
there
all
the
time.
anything
could
have
happened
to
him.
he
use
to
sort
of
falling
all
over
and
so
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
state
had
testimony
of
a
deputy
sheriff
in
which
he
mrerly
went
into
what
the
court
has
referred
to
as
the
statutory
question.
did
you
offer
him
anything?
and
this
was
all
testimony
that
related
to
what
occurred
in
the
jail.
did
you
put
him
in
fear?
did
you
promise
him
anything
that
sort
of
stuff?
that
is
here
in
the
record
on
page
113
as
i
say
that
is
just
the
statutory
questions.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
he
said,
they
brought
him
down,
they
interrogate
him,
they
scolded
him,
i
don't
know
what
he
might
have
meant
by
that,
but
at
that
point,
he
said
he
was
in
terrible
pain
and
he
was
--
this
petitioner
as
i
have
stated,
but
on
the
jackson
v.
denno
point,
i
think
it's
crucial
that
as
of
the
time,
the
court
ruled
upon
that.
he
had
the
petitioner's
statement
about
the
brutally
inflicted
upon
him.
he
had
evidence
of
who
this
petitioner
was
and
he
had
statements
of
the
state
that
at
--
at
the
jail,
there
was
a
--
he
was
asked
the
so
called
statutory
question
and
the
state
supreme
court
at
no
point
here,
makes
an
effort
to
demonstrate
that
the
jackson
v.
denno
standards
complied
with.
all
the
state
says
as
well,
it
was
--
we
have
other
rules
of
law
here
which
don't
require
this
to
be
done
and
in
any
event,
if
there
was
error,
it
was
harmless
error.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
reference
also
to
the
argument
that
we
make
that
the
state
did
not
follow
the
standards
set
down
by
this
court
for
judging
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
those
standards
i
think
have
stated
that
quite
an
early
date
in
wan
against
united
states,
and
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
brandeis
wrote
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
held
the
prisoner's
statement
is
admissible
on
the
ground
that
a
confession
made
by
one
competent
to
act
is
to
be
deemed
voluntary
as
a
matter
of
law
if
it
was
not
induced
by
a
promise
or
a
threat,
that
was
only
the
standard
that
georgia
has
used.
and
mr.
justice
brandeis
went
on
to
say,
“a
confession
is
voluntary
in
law
if
and
only
if
it
was
in
fact
voluntarily
made.
a
confession
obtained
by
compulsion
must
be
excluded.”
and
in
rogers
v.
richmond,
the
court
went
on
to
elaborate
on
this
and
indicated
that
corroboration
was
not
evidence
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
and
yet,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
relies
upon
what
the
trial
court
refers
to
as
statutory
question
on
page
211
in
qualifying
the
admissibility
of
a
statement.
the
judge
says,
we'll
ask
him
the
statutory
questions
and
he's
asked,
did
anybody
offer
him
anything?
was
he
threatened?
was
he
promised?
the
modus
sphere
of
injury,
the
judge
says
admissible
and
we
submit
that
these
are
not
the
standards
which
this
court
has
set
down
and
not
the
standards
by
which
a
confession
should
be
reviewed
and
certainly
not
the
standard
of
corroboration.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
judge
never
stated
nor
in
any
other
way
indicated
implicitly
or
explicitly
that
he
had
found
this
confession
to
be
voluntary.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
denied
the
motion
but
if
a
denial
of
the
motion
under
georgia
standards
of
this
sort
is
complied
to
jackson
v.
denno,
jackson
v.
denno
is
meaningless.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
judge
denied
this
and
did
not
make
any
findings
and
did
so
under
a
rule
of
law
that
previously
existed
in
georgia
and
has
been
reaffirmed
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
which
holds
that
a
confession
is
admissible
upon
a
prima
facie
showing
of
admissibility
and
consequently
under
the
georgia
law,
this
judge
held
the
confession
admissible.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct
in
terms
of
what
the
judge
said,
but
in
terms
of
what
he
did,
he
was
here
on
a
record
in
which
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
that
--
what
isaac
sims
said
happened
to
him,
uncontradicted
evidence
isaac
sims
said
happened
to
him,
did
happen.
now,
the
state
supreme
court
then
passing
upon
whether
the
confession
should
have
been
admitted
says
in
effect
that
this
confession
is
admissible
not
upon,
not
necessarily
upon
a
finding
of
voluntariness
which
would
be
jackson
v.
denno,
this
confession
is
admissible
because
there
was
a
prima
facie
showing
the
voluntariness
and
it
says
this
because
at
no
point,
it
disavows
it's
previous
cases
and
in
fact
said
that
its
procedure
is
distinguishable
from
the
procedure
in
jackson
v.
denno
because
it
has
certain
other
rules
of
law.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court,
just
a
word
on
the
jury
point,
there
has
been
--
that
has
been
stated
to
the
court
for
the
first
time,
some
facts
which
certainly
do
not
appear
on
the
record
about
numbers
of
negroes
on
the
panel
and
so
forth
and
on
the
grand
jury
and
we
rest
upon
what
the
record
in
these
case
is.
the
state
certainly
had
within
its
power
to
establish
the
facts
if
they
were
otherwise
at
the
trial
and
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
this
record.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
there
were
nine
--
the
only
information
i
have
mr.
justice
black
is
from
the
record
in
which
five
were
identified
and
now
the
nine
--
i
have
to
dispute
it
because
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
it's
true.
i
went
down
and
i
made
an
independent
count
and
i
might
find
it's
none
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
at
the
very
least
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
to
have
a
further
hearing
on
this.
indeed,
i
just
feel
that
on
this
record,
i
have
to
believe
what
the
record
tells
me
and
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
are
nine.
the
first
we've
heard
about
none
was
at
this
time.
if
there's
any
doubt
about
the
standard
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
used,
i
submit
that
the
court
to
look
at
the
top
of
page
336
of
the
record
on
the
jackson
v.
denno
point.
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
makes
quite
clear
336
that
it
is
adhering
to
its
prior
standard.
it
examines
the
fact
and
says,
the
related
facts
made
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the
statement
was
freely
and
voluntarily
made
and
admissible
into
evidence.
now,
i
don't
know
what
more
one
would
need
to
be
persuaded
that
georgia
is
using
and
it
cites
the
old
cases.
the
jury
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
336.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
first
sentence
and
the
first
full
paragraph
that
georgia
is
using
the
prima
facie
standard
and
not
the
finding
of
voluntary
standard.
and
indeed
on
337,
in
it's
distinguishing
of
the
cases
it
makes
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
finding
that
the
jackson
procedure
was
followed,
but
rather
there
are
reasons
why
it
didn't
have
to
be
followed.
in
the
middle
of
337,
about
a
third
of
the
way
down
the
first
bullet
paragraph,
did
we
think
that
the
jackson
case
applied
to
this
case,
we
would
unhesitatingly
follow
it
which
to
me
contains
an
implication
that
they
are
not
following
it
and
then
they
give
some
reasons
why
they're
not
following
it
and
that
because
georgia
has
some
certain
legal
doctrines
which
make
it
rather
different
than
new
york,
and
so
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
doubt
at
all
that
neither
the
trial
judge
and
certainly
that
state
supreme
court
in
assessing
what
the
trial
judge
did
believe
that
they
were
doing
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
what
jackson
requires.
now,
there
is
some
allegation
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
your
honor
as
i
read
that,
that's
one
of
those
--
sometimes
confusing
statements
one
sees
in
trial
records
--
people
think
on
their
feet
and
he
apparently
said,
“well,
let's
have
a
hearing
and
now,
i
guess
we
had
it
and
i'm
not
sure
we
never
had
it”
and
then
things
just
kind
of
drifted
off
and
i
think
it's
really
not
conclusive
as
to
any
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
yes,
and
then
there
was
an
objection
later
on
and
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
about
jackson
v.
denno.
now,
much
is
made
of
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
was
treated
in
a
friendly
manner
at
the
jail
and
in
fact,
he
had
nothing
to
eat
and
it
was
about
eight
hours
since
he
had
eaten.
he
was
in
what
now
is
uncontradicted.
he
had
to
be
in
extremely
severe
pain
as
a
result
of
what
happened
to
him.
no
one
is
any
longer
denying
that.
the
fact
that
the
jailers
asserted
that
they
treated
him
in
a
friendly
way,
i
think
it
proves
nothing.
this
court
in
the
miranda
case
for
example,
took
note
of
the
so
called
mutt
and
jeff
technique
of
interrogation
in
which
some
people
treat
the
prisoner
in
a
brutal
manner
and
then
some
people
come
up
and
treat
him
in
a
friendly
manner
and
the
friendly
treatment
in
it
of
itself,
we
submit
proves
nothing.
we
submit
that
this
case
is
virtually
to
the
extent
that
you
could
find
two
cases
that
involve
parallel
sets
of
facts
on
all
force
with
fikes
against
alabama.
here,
both
petitioners
were
approximately
the
same
age.
both
had
third
grade
education.
both
were
of
extremely
limited
mentality.
both
were
arrested
by
civilians
to
follow
the
parallel
further.
neither
was
arraigned
or
taken
to
a
magistrate
before
the
confession.
each
of
them
was
allegedly
advised
of
some
legal
rights.
sims
saw
no
friend,
relative
or
counsel,
fikes
saw
his
employer.
the
fikes
record
contains
no
evidence
of
physical
brutality
although
the
fikes
record
did
involve
a
time
period
of
several
days
before
the
confession.
this
record
involved
somewhat
slighter
time
period
but
now
--
but
contained
uncontradicted
evidence
of
physical
brutality
inflicted
on
the
petitioner
shortly
before
the
alleged
confession
and
we
submit
that
the
proper
procedure
was
not
followed
as
required
by
the
jackson
case,
but
then
any
event
on
uncontradicted
evidence
on
this
record,
the
conviction
below
should
be
reversed
because
the
confession
was
coerced
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
cornelius.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
was
part
of
the
same
transaction.
it
was
the
reaffirmation
of
the
original
confession.
this
was
at
or
about
a
time
when
a
warrant
had
been
issued
against
him
and
he
was
as
denoted
in
georgia
law
an
accused
and
he
still
had
no
counsel.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
it
has
any
effect.
i
would
think
that
the
momentum
of
the
conditions
that
led
to
the
first
confession
certainly
carried
on
shortly
thereafter
a
period
of
several
days
thereafter
he
was
brought
back
in
handcuffs
to
folkston
where
the
crime
has
supposed
to
have
occurred.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
that
it
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
that
by
a
week
later,
he
certainly
should
have
had
counsel,
friends
or
someone
advising
him
or
assisting
him.
by
this
time,
a
warrant
had
been
issued
against
him.
some
of
the
protections
are
suggested
or
required
by
the
messiah
case
for
example
should
have
been
made
available
to
him
and
--
but
in
any
event,
there
are
numerous
cases
in
this
court
in
which
the
defendants
give
a
whole
series
of
confessions
and
this
court
has
held
upon
a
finding
that
one
of
them
was
coerced
that
it
was
adequate
grounds
for
reversal.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
we
do
your
honor
but
it
would
be
rather
simple
to
supply
them
because
there
are
a
number
of
--
i'll
check
it
again.
i
can't
recall
it
at
the
moment
but
if
not
we
will
submit
it
to
the
court.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
i
add
just
one
point
you
honor
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
statement
made
that
prior
to
jackson
v.
denno,
there
had
not
been
these
pre-trial
hearings
on
the
confession
and
the
counsel
in
georgia
informs
me
that
this
is
not
the
case
that
mr.
moore
himself
for
many
years
before
jackson
v.
denno
would
try
the
confession
issue
separately
under
the
old
georgia
rule
before
the
trial.
