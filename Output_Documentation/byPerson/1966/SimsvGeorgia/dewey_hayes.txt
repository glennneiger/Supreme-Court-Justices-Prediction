mr.
dewey
hayes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
answer
in
response
to
some
questions
that
has
just
been
presented
to
the
court,
but
i
would
like
to
state
it
this
time
with
the
court's
permission
that
my
argument
will
be
brief,
mr.
freeman
leverett
will
argue
procedural
on
the
questions.
back
to
justice
white's
question,
the
sheriff
along
with
the
deputy
sheriff,
along
with
the
petitioner,
testified
in
the
motion
to
suppress
and
the
supreme
court
judge
ruled
after
hearing
the
testimony
from
those
people.
mr.
dewey
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
dewey
hayes
your
honor,
in
response
to
that,
the
trial
judge
was
familiar
denno
versus
jackson.
he
did
follow
the
rule.
now,
the
proposition
here
as
far
as
i'm
concern
was
not
or
whether
not
it
was
followed
in
the
court
back
then
in
charlton
county,
it
is
that
the
counsel
here
today
doesn't
understand
that
it
was
followed.
it
was
followed
and
we
followed
the
procedure
--
it
was
followed.
mr.
dewey
hayes
the
testimony
of
dr.
jackson
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
dewey
hayes
well,
yeah.
that's
not
exactly
what
happened
though.
they
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
i
would
say.
mr.
dewey
hayes
i
would
say
following
the
rule
into
this
court
that
what
could
have
happened,
what
didn't
happened
but
what
could
have
happened,
what
allegedly
happened
in
dr.
jackson's
office,
some
seven
hour
prior
to
that
time
in
folkston,
georgia,
that
was
some
35
or
40
miles
away
from
waycross,
it
could
have
had
no
effect
on
what
happened
in
waycross,
georgia
as
i
said
some
30
or
40
miles
away
from
there
in
a
different
county
and
a
different
court
house
with
a
different
set
of
officers,
it
could
have
no
connection
in
this
case
because
this
court
as
i
understand
had
ruled
that
if
you
have
different
officers
and
different
place
and
a
different
time
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
there's
no
testimony
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
our
contention
is
that
there's
nothing
happened
in
dr.
jackson's
office.
mr.
dewey
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
dewey
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
dewey
hayes
dr.
jackson.
mr.
dewey
hayes
yes
sir,
he
denied
it.
mr.
dewey
hayes
counselors
--
he's
previously
read
it
you
honor,
correctly
read.
mr.
dewey
hayes
your
honor
now,
dr.
jackson
testified,
he
was
on
the
stand
and
counsel
told
the
defendant
had
a
full
right
to
cross
examining
and
if
he
had
believed
or
if
he
had
a
reason
to
think
that
dr.
jackson
or
anyone
had
mistreated
the
defendant
in
dr.
jackson's
office,
he
could
have
cross
examined
dr.
jackson.
he
could
have
asked
him
any
question
that
he
saw
fit,
he
could
have
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
i
do
not
recall
an
exact
testimony
of
everything
but
there
was
state's
testimony
there
and
the
state's
testimony
was
that
he
was
not
brutalized
in
dr.
jackson's
office.
mr.
dewey
hayes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can't
point
it
out
in
the
record.
mr.
dewey
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
dewey
hayes
i
don't
recall
everything
in
the
record.
i
apologize
if
i've
said
something
wrong,
but
i
do
not
recall
it.
i
cannot
recall
everything
in
the
record.
mr.
dewey
hayes
your
honor,
i
do
not
recall
actually.
mr.
dewey
hayes
the
only
testimony
i
remember
your
honor
was
a
sheriff,
sheriff
robert
lee,
the
deputy
sheriff
jones
and
the
petitioner.
mr.
dewey
hayes
no
sir,
they
were
not.
but
dr.
jackson
testify
at
the
trial
and
they
had
a
right
to
cross
examine,
they
did
cross
examine
and
brought
out
anything
they
wish
to
bring
out.
mr.
dewey
hayes
at
the
trial.
there
was
an
objection
of
the
confession.
mr.
dewey
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
dewey
hayes
now,
well
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
your
honor,
on
the
confession,
the
jury
was
excluded,
but
the
jury
was
not
excluded
during
dr.
jackson's
testimony.
mr.
dewey
hayes
as
i
recall,
the
confession
was
first.
mr.
dewey
hayes
i'm
not
paused
if
i
had
to
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
you
honor,
i
do
not
recall
which
witness
was
first.
in
the
composition
of
our
jury,
the
question
has
been
raised
about
how
this
jury
was
composed.
now
of
course
we
have
a
jury
panel
who
makes
up
a
list.
these
jurors
to
try
this
case
was
selected
from
this
and
99
jurors
were
called
to
try
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
out
of
the
99
jurors
that
were
called,
actually,
nine
of
those
people
were
called.
on
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
actually
sims
actually
at
least
one
member
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
the
defendant
was
colored
and
at
least
three
or
four
of
these
nine
of
the
99
called
that
term
of
court
was
on
the
panel
of
48
that
the
defendant
was
tried
from
which
means
that
in
charlton
county,
georgia,
you
do
have
a
fair
representation
of
old
people
on
the
jury.
this
jury,
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury
was
legally
composed
and
he
received
a
proper
trial
in
charlton
county.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
relinquish
the
rest
of
the
time
to
mr.
freeman
leverett.
mr.
dewey
hayes
your
honor,
we
had
99
jurors
called.
of
those
jurors
as
a
matter
of
fact,
nine
were
colored.
now
on
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
does
the
record
show
that
fact?
mr.
dewey
hayes
that
was
in
the
brief
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
dewey
hayes
your
honor
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
the
record
shows
the
names
of
nine
people
which
were
colored.
as
i
recall,
the
record
has
the
names
of
jurors
and
out
of
those
99,
nine
of
them
was
actually
colored.
mr.
dewey
hayes
the
record
only
shows
names.
mr.
dewey
hayes
the
record
does
show
according
to
their
contentions
that
four
colored
were
on
the
panel
of
48
that
was
put
on
this
defendant
to
be
tried.
the
record
probably
shows
that
at
least
one
member
of
the
grand
jury
panel
was
colored
but
now
actually
in
the
record,
they
ask
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
pull
out
the
ones
that
they
knew
were
colored
and
he
named
five
people
that
he
remembered
as
to
being
colored
but
actually
the
clerk
didn't
remember
all
of
them.
mr.
dewey
hayes
no
sir.
mr.
dewey
hayes
we
could
supplement
the
record
and
show
them
that
it
was
true,
there
were
nine.
we
could
do
that
because
that
is
true.
mr.
dewey
hayes
but
as
i
stated,
he
had
asked
the
clerk
as
i
recall
about
how
many
were
colored
they
had
and
--
mr.
dewey
hayes
yes
sir.
mr.
dewey
hayes
and
the
clerk
said,
he
recall
five
that
he
knew
was
colored.
mr.
dewey
hayes
by
that
record.
mr.
dewey
hayes
but
as
i
said,
the
records
thus
show
without
question
that
four
of
the
panel
of
48
was
colored.
mr.
dewey
hayes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
answer
in
response
to
some
questions
that
has
