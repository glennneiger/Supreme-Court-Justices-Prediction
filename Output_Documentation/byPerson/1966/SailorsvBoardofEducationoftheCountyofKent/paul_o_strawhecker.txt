mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
is
whether
the
composition
of
local
units
of
government
is
a
state
matter
and
not
a
subject
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
or
to
put
it
another
way,
will
the
court
extend
reynolds
into
this
new
and
unchartered
political
picket?
will
the
court
assume
that
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature
will
fail
to
correct
any
malapportionment
in
its
boards,
in
its
agencies,
in
its
instrumentalities
when
corrective
measures
are
needed?
in
the
many
briefs
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
it
was
first
viewed,
i
believe,
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
you
held
that
but
this,
my
point
is,
is
a
new
picket
and
not
the
one
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
talking
about.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
think
--
actually,
i
think
there
are
many
more
brumbles
in
this
picket
mr.
justice
douglas
than
in
the
one
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
talking
about.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
that
is
my
position
on
behalf
representing
the
kent
county
board
of
education
flatly.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
we
don't
need
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
position
that's
true
in
representing
kentwood,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
talking
about
the
kent
county
board
of
education
and
that
kentwood
public
school
which
are
hurt
by
this
thing
in
financial
wagers.
now,
i
think
it
is
conceded
in
all
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
that
there
is
no
federal
right
to
vote
in
local
elections.
i
think
that
is
conceded.
now,
i
think
that
also
all
of
the
briefs
concede
that
the
power
of
the
state
to
create
and
abolish
local
units
of
government
is
absolute.
now,
we
move
to
the
third
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
beg
your
pardon
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
read
the
fortson
case
that
way
mr.
justice
douglas.
as
i
understand
the
fortson
case,
the
majority
of
the
court
took
the
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
or
its
amendments
that
requires
georgia
to
elect
a
governor
by
popular
election.
that
place
that
one
step
in
the
direction
that
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
pakistan
is
not
you
--
you
--
is
not
unique
in
that
respect,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
think
that
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
legislature
within
its
constitution,
its
constitution.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
don't
know
if
a
constitution
should
draw
along
that
line.
certainly
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well,
in
our
democratic
form
of
government
with
a
small
d,
i
think
that
it
might
be
possible
but
i'm
not
aware
that
there
is
any
said
constitutional
provision.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
oh
what
we
have
mr.
justice
douglas
as
i
understand
it
in
our
country
is
a
republican
form
of
government
which
means
that
the
people
elect
representatives
to
cast
their
ballot.
now,
that
goes
through
the
whole
hoof
and
woof
of
our
entire
system
of
states.
now,
that
requires
i
think
in
the
broad
in
our
system
of
government
in
our
political
philosophy
that
requires
that
in
our
particular
states
without
the
federal
constitution
that
we
must
provide
some
appropriate
method
of
our
interior
works.
now,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
particualrly
the
second
section
of
the
fourteenth
ammendment
does
make
some
specific
provisions
as
to
what
you
have
to
do
in
electing
both
representatives
and
senators
and
congress
and
what
you
have
to
do
also
within
your
own
state.
but
with
those
limitations
i
think
that
a
state
which
is
constitutionally
apportioned
i
think
very
defintely
that
a
state
whose
legislature
and
the
one
in
michigan
i
think
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
today.
after
they
are
properly
apportioned,
i
think
that
under
the
constitution
of
michigan
and
most
states,
the
legislature
have
the
absolute
power
to
make,
create,
and
abolish
agencies
for
its
better
government.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
the
question
of
equity
in
this
phrase
of
it
of
that
instrumentality
of
government
is
unique.go
back
to
hunter
versus
pittsburgh.
go
back
to
attorney
general
versus
lowrey.
the
people
in
those
cases
were
overwhelmed
and
had
no
right
because
in
these
transfers
of
territory
as
had
been
pointed
out,
its
analogy;
it's
a
good
analogy,
these
transfers
in
territory
that
people
have
never
had
a
right
to
vote.
now,
in
this
very
case
an
odd
thing,
there
were
35
annexations
to
the
city
of
grand
rapids
in
the
context
to
what
we're
talking
about
in
the
case
at
bar
certified
under
the
home
rule
act.
the
school
code
at
that
time
provided
that
by
reason
of
such
annexations,
that
territory
as
a
matter
of
law
became
a
part
of
the
grand
rapids
school
district.
now,
because
kentwood
was
a
new
school
district
and
there
have
been
nine
pieces
of
territory
taken
away
from
it
without
assemblance,
without
any
right
whatever
to
the
people
of
kentwood
to
be
heard
or
to
vote,
after
those
nine,
it
went
to
the
legislature
and
got
that
section
of
the
statute
up
here
so
that
today
where
there
is
an
annexation
under
the
home
rule
act
that
territory
still
stays
in
the
school
district.
now,
what
triggered
this
case,
this
piece
of
territory
was
a
part
of
kentwood.
it
was
taken
away
by
one
of
these
home
rule
annexations
without
a
vote
of
the
kentwood
school
electors.
we
went
back
immediately
because
of
the
--
the
pendencies
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
legislature
had
passed
to
appeal
but
it
hadn't
become
effective.
we
went
back
to
the
county
board
of
education
and
ask
them
not
to
take
away
from
the
grand
rapids
board
of
education
but
to
give
it
factious.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
now,
there's
another
thing.
my
brother
cites
the
1960
census,
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
mentioned
that
brambles
about
this
political
picket.
in
1960
the
figures
that
my
brother
cites,
grand
rapids
had
55%
of
the
population.
in
their
own
brief,
they
admit
that
in
1963
it
had
dropped
to
48%.
now,
i
just
--
in
the
briefs,
in
the
affidavits,
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute.
as
of
now,
as
of
now
the
20
school
districts,
there
are
21
including
grand
rapids,
the
20
school
disctricts
on
the
periphery
of
the
city
of
grand
rapids
have
not
only
a
majority
of
the
population,
more
than
50%
of
the
population,
they
have
over
17,000
more
school
children
according
to
the
1966
census,
the
1967
will
be
taken
next
month.
and
not
only
that
they
have
more
dollars
in
valuation.
so
here
we
are
today,
they
say
give
us
one
man
one
vote,
we
want
the
county
board
of
education
to
be
apportioned.
i
don't
know
how
because
they
haven't
said.
as
i
understand
it's
done
one
in
two
ways
possibly.
we'll
elect
them
at
large
or
suggest
to
the
legislature
they
create
districts.
okay,
reynolds
is
applied
to
our
situation
instead
of
any
relief
that
my
brother
and
his
client,
the
grand
rapids
board
of
education
because
they
got
more
voters
on
the
20
dic
--
districts
as
a
matter
of
politics
they
can
go
out
and
elect
all
five.
he
says
that
by
courtesy
mrs.keeler
is
a
member
of
the
board.
it
was
a
matter
of
fact
when
we
started
the
hearing
i
requested
that
she'd
not
sit
because
she
was
wearing
two
hats,
she
elected
to
sit.
a
few
years
after
that,
the
1965,
a
legislature
caught
up
with
it
to
provide
now
that
members
of
county
boards
get
sit
on
a
transfer
proposition
when
they
are
actually
members
of
both
boards.
now,
you
go
to
a
districting
proposition.
suppose
this
court
should
suggest
to
the
commission
of
legislature
or
through
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
that
what
you
should
do
misrepresented
it
that
type
of
argument
that
what
you
should
do
is
to
create
districts.
alright,
the
population
is
still
with
the
20
school
districts.
they've
got
17,000
more
school
children
and
they've
got
more
valuation
that
my
brother
talks
about
on
tax
so
unless
there
are
political
gerrymandering
as
i
read
in
the
papers
as
happening
in
some
of
these
legislative
apportionment
things
unless
they
are
gerrymandering
the
result
would
be
the
same.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
assume
that
i'm
wrong
and
the
results
so
far
is
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
that's
exactly
what
i
was
saying
your
honor
that
even
whether
it's
a
general
election
or
whether
it's
by
district
in
our
particular
case,
the
result
would
be
the
same.
and
reynolds
versus
sims
would
not
help
at
all
because
no
matter
how
you
--
no
ma
--
no
matter
how
you
consider
it
the
--
there
are
more
voters
in
the
20
school
disctrics
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
in
grand
rapids.
there
is
more
children
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
there
is
more
evaluation.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
don't
say
that,
i
don't
say
that
--
i
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well,
reynolds
versus
--
versus
sims
will
not
answer
the
problem
of
my
brother
in
the
city
in
grand
rapids
in
this
case
at
all
because
the
--
one
of
the
assumptions
of
reynolds
versus
sims
is
to
correct
an
imbalance
in
--
in
minorities,
to
--
to
help
out
minorities
to
--
to
get
the
minorites
an
equal
weighted
vote
with
which
i
agree.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
the
legislative
life
level
but
the
trouble
is
that
you
still
got
majorities.
and
what
i'm
saying
is,
that
here
is
the
odd
situation
of
a
minority
coming
up
here
and
saying,
apply
reynolds
versus
sims
because
we
want
equal
votes
and
you
give
them
equal
votes.
and
that
the
majority
is
still
is
with
the
school
districts
outside
of
grand
rapids
and
they
all
go
out
and
elect
at
large
the
five
members
of
the
board.
they
have
the
political
power.
not
only
that
you
create
districts.
i
understand
reynolds
versus
sims
the
districts
must
be
under
equal
population
if
possible
if
that
is
true
and
it
follows,
then
the
same
situation
politically
applies,
it's
done
honestly,
and
not
by
gerrymandering
because
the
majority
will
still
be
with
the
20
school
districts
in
the
outside.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
the
michigan
or
--
i'd
say
at
least
a
hundred
years
has
been
provided
in
the
general
school
laws
that
all
locals
so-called
local
board
of
education
be
elected
at
large.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
be
elected
at
large.
first
is
the
grand
rapids
board
is
a
second
class
school
district.
there
are
only
two,
the
other
city
is
flint.
and
by
the
statute
regulating
second
class
they
have
nine
members.
now,
there
was
nine
members
of
that
board
are
elected
at
large
three
at
a
time,
every
year
so
three
at
a
time
by
the
entire
city
of
grand
rapids.
now,
it
is
the
members
of
those
boards
would
get
together
and
from
their
membership
select
one
each
two
years
to
go
to
this
other
assembly
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
and
i
used
the
word
selecting
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
selecting
a
member
or
two
memebrs
of
the
county
board
of
education.
now,
my
brother
did
not
state
clearly
the
qualifications
of
the
member
of
the
county
board
of
education
is
that
he
must
be
a
tax
paying
school
electorate
of
a
district
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
county.
and
the
statute
is
i
think
very
clearly
set
up
in
the
briefs.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
it
doesn't
compell
them
at
all
as
i
understand
the
cases
and
i
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
the
solicitor
general
calls
this
a
two-step
proposition.
now,
as
as
i
understand
it
there
is
no
complaint
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
five
member
board.
the
attack
in
this
case
is
made
on
the
formation
of
the
assembly
which
does
this
election.
that
is
one
member
from
each
of
the
20
boards
would
come
every
two
years
to
a
meeting
place
to
select
one
or
two
members
of
the
county
board
whose
terms
are
expired.
now,
that's
two
states.
the
complaint
is
made
against
that
assembly,
but
the
point
is
this.
education
has
never
been
a
part
in
michigan
of
local
self
government,
never.
and
school
electors
in
michigan
have
never
had
the
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
oh!
very
definitely.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
say
so
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
think
so.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
think
so
mr.
justice
black
that
because
as
pointed
out
in
gray
versus
sanders,
that
georgians
had
a
right
to
vote.
and
in
the
fortson
case
they
said
this
is
not
a
voting
case.
in
my
position
it's
flatly
that
in
this
area
these
are
not
voting
cases.
they're
not
voting
cases
because
there
is
no
right.
there
certainly
is
no
federally
constitu
--
federally
--
federal
constitutional
right
that
to
vote
at
least
that
that
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
to
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
to
vote
in
this
--
these
elections
for
local
units
of
government
or
their
membership.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well
the
method
of
election
is
actually
only
a
selection
what
the
state
is
doing
in
that
situation
in
saying
exercising
his
power
to
determine
the
method
by
which
a
member
of
a
local
unit
of
government
will
be
selected.
now,
in
this
ins
--
instituted
by
this
particular
assembly.
now,
if
the
--
as
was
suggested
on
the
other
argument,
there's
no
question
about
what
the
michigan
legislature
tomorrow
could
say,
"well
we
will
abolish
that
assembly
and
we
will
have
every
member
of
every
county
board
of
education
in
the
state
of
michigan
appointed
by
the
government".
and
to
me
--
to
me
here
you
have
a
method
of
selection
where
you
have
educators.
they
have
to
be
interested
in
education,
the
people
who
selected
for
this
very
sensitive
fuction
of
special
education
for
handicapped
children.
this
concept
with
the
county
board
brand
new
in
michigans
that
it
was
only
established
in
19
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
no
they
wouldn't
--
they
wouldn't.
there's
no
question
about
it.
it
was
appointed
by
the
governor.
personally,
i
believe
that
the
method
of
selection
in
the
case
that
we
have
a
bar
that's
--
at
bar
that's
what
i
know
about
is
much
fairer
actually
than
to
have
these
people
appointed
by
the
governor
because
we
have
governors
of
--
in
my
state,
a
different
political
phase
every
now
and
then,
and
the
power
to
appoint
five
members
in
the
83
counties
of
michigan
is
a
power
that
i
just
hope
they
never
have.
i
take
the
practical
point
of
view
that
so
far
as
my
state
is
concerned
and
this
county
board
of
education
is
concerned,
the
method
of
selection,
the
method
of
selection
is
the
fairest
that
can
be
divided.
and
preserve
at
least
some
motive
of
--
of
a
membership
by
the
grand
rapids
board.
and
they
admit
that
they
grand
rapids
board
has
had
a
member
on
that
county
board
for
sometime
and
the
same
member
is
on
that
board
now
that
voted
against
the
transfer
initally
in
this
case.
now,
i
firmly
urge
that
in
our
case,
the
method
of
selection
is
fair.
it's
reasonable.
that
method
has
not
caused
any
disparity,
minority
situation
in
our
case
whatever.
it's
a
proper
method
of
selection
where
people
who
are
dedicated
to
education
by
serving
on
boards
of
education
get
together
to
select
the
members
of
this
county
board
which
has
its
very
sensitive
function
in
michigan
as
special
education
in
handicapped
children,
which
is
administered
on
a
countrywide
basis
without
regard
to
race,
color
or
creed
and
certainly
without
regard
to
the
district
from
which
they
come.
now,
the
1935
act
specifically
provided
that
nothing
in
this
county
board
act
or
power
should
conflict
with
the
powers
under
the
general
school
law
entertained
in
which
historically
a
local
--
so-called
local
or
constituent
board
of
education
had.
there
can
be
no
conflict.
i
don't
believe
that
there
--
is
even
such
a
conflict
that
should
be
--
could
be
resolved
by
the
state
board
of
education
because
there
isn't
that.
the
local
boards
run
schools
generally
from
kindergarten
to
the
12th
grade
except
within
the
framework
and
the
requirements
of
law
in
the
state
board
of
education
they
run
their
own
schools
according
to
what
their
lights
are
the
best
education
for
the
children.
now,
that's
entirely
distinct
in
the
part
from
the
duties
of
the
county
board
of
education.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
pardon.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well,
its
powers
since
1935
have
been
somewhat
expanded.
when
this
case
first
started,
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
tax.
what
they
had
to
do
once
they
submit
a
budget
to
what
we
call
the
allocation
board
to
be
divided
within
the
15
mills.
recently,
primarily
because
of
this
great
thing
that
come
to
michigan
this
county
special
education
program
for
handicapped
children
which
preceded
federal
grants
and
developments
in
that
respect
in
the
county.
now,
that's
adopted
by
the
counties
by
referendum.
now,
because
of
that,
they
were
given
the
tax
power
as
i
believe
and
the
power
to
bond
for
the
purpose
of
building
facilities.
but
their
powers
mr.
chief
justice
are
limited.
the
bonding
power
is
to
the
specific
phases.
originally
they
took
the
place
of
a
county
superintendent
who
was
a
politician
run
for
office
on
a
partisan
ticket.
then
the
county
superintendent
schools
is
now
and
i
used
to
have
historically
in
every
state
i
believe
is
now
appointed
by
the
county
board.
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
it
then
they
use
to
help
the
rural
school
districts,
and
the
teachers
they
would
help
in
their
employment.
i
think
that
they
still
do
that.
they
worked
and
originally
intended
to
help
actually
the
rural
school
districts.
and
now
it
is
expanded
until
it's
true
they
do
have
the
power
to
tax
for
very
limited
purposes
are
not
broad
purposes.
they
have
--
and
the
power
to
bond
is
a
limited
power
to
only
a
bond
for
a
certain
type
of
facilities.
that
generally
mr.
chief
justice
is
their
power.
it's
something
that
is
superimposed
but
certainly
it
has
no
control
whatever
to
local
boards
of
education.
mr
justice
fortas
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
as
of
now
your
honor
there
are
only
21.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
definitely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
yes,
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
and
it's
a
more
limited
power
of
bonding
than
local
school
districts
board
of
education
has.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
oh!
definitely
not,
absolutely
not.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
that's
correct,
for
instance
the
special
education
program,
these
smaller
school
districts
in
grand
rapids.
now,
i
know
that
grand
rapids
has
had
a
handicap
program
for
many
years.
the
other
districts
weren't
wealthy
enough
to
do
it
so
the
idea
was
to
help
the
county
base,
tax
base
do
it.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
your
--
your
statement
that
the
powers
are
axuiliary
is
--
is
accurate.
that
they
are
auxiliary,
they're
not
the
same.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
it
was
organized,
the
statute
specifically
provided
that
it
was
not
intended
by
the
fact
that
it
takes
away
or
detracts
in
anyway
the
powers
of
local
boards
of
education.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
no
absolutely
not.
annexation
and
consolidation
provisions
are
under
two
different
sections.
what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case
is
the
power
to
transfer
the
upon
or
live
across
the
road
from
a
school
house
but
that
was
in
any
district
then
this
child
had
to
walk
through
the
snow
three
miles,
the
other
school
districts
so
he
would
go
some
place
to
ask
that
his
house
be
set
off
in
the
other
school
district.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
no,
it's
--
it's
by
the
reorganization
of
the
act.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
300
cases,
i
believe
the
court
is
fully
apprised
of
the
--
let
me
say
unusual
circumstances,
unique
circumstances
in
the
sailors
case.
i'm
sure
the
court
understands
thoroughly
the
constitutional
questions
that
we
raised.
now
we
have
one
peculiar
passage.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
to
the
fact
of
the
question
which
unfortunately
is
in
our
case,
is
constitutionally
insignificant
and
we
certainly
agree.
the
difficulty
is
that
the
appellants
have
brought
it
here.
it
is
one
of
their
claims
or
relief
that
the
transfer
which
triggered
this
litigation,
the
transfer
by
the
kent
county
board
of
education,
two
kentwood
public
schools
that
i
represent
(inaudible)
public
schools
is
void.
and
the
relief
i
ask
that
this
court
set
that
transfer
aside.
now,
that
means
six
and
a
half
million
dollars
of
valuation
to
my
school
district
client
and
the
fourteen
room
modern
schoolhouse.
the
three
judges
in
the
district
court
were
unanimous
that
at
least
the
body
was
a
de
facto
body
and
that
the
transfer
should
stand.
now,
whatever
else
happened
in
sailors
in
number
430?
i
urged
the
court
to
say
that
they
affirm
the
three
judges
of
the
district
court
and
place
--
prevent
the
transfer
to
stand.
one
last
word,
we
urged
that
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature
is
more
competent
to
determine
the
method
of
selecting
its
numerous
diverse
board
or
agencies
in
selecting
the
membership
of
it
in
peculiar
circumstances
that
may
exist
and
change
from
time
to
time
in
the
state
than
any
court.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
is
whether
the
composition
of
local
units
of
government
is
a
state
matter
and
not
a
subject
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
or
to
put
it
another
way,
will
the
court
extend
reynolds
into
this
new
and
unchartered
political
picket?
will
the
court
assume
that
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature
will
fail
to
correct
any
malapportionment
in
its
boards,
in
its
agencies,
in
its
instrumentalities
when
corrective
measures
are
needed?
in
the
many
briefs
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
it
was
first
viewed,
i
believe,
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
you
held
that
but
this,
my
point
is,
is
a
new
picket
and
not
the
one
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
talking
about.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
think
--
actually,
i
think
there
are
many
more
brumbles
in
this
picket
mr.
justice
douglas
than
in
the
one
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
talking
about.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
that
is
my
position
on
behalf
representing
the
kent
county
board
of
education
flatly.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
we
don't
need
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
position
that's
true
in
representing
kentwood,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
talking
about
the
kent
county
board
of
education
and
that
kentwood
public
school
which
are
hurt
by
this
thing
in
financial
wagers.
now,
i
think
it
is
conceded
in
all
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
that
there
is
no
federal
right
to
vote
in
local
elections.
i
think
that
is
conceded.
now,
i
think
that
also
all
of
the
briefs
concede
that
the
power
of
the
state
to
create
and
abolish
local
units
of
government
is
absolute.
now,
we
move
to
the
third
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
beg
your
pardon
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
read
the
fortson
case
that
way
mr.
justice
douglas.
as
i
understand
the
fortson
case,
the
majority
of
the
court
took
the
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
or
its
amendments
that
requires
georgia
to
elect
a
governor
by
popular
election.
that
place
that
one
step
in
the
direction
that
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
pakistan
is
not
you
--
you
--
is
not
unique
in
that
respect,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
think
that
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
legislature
within
its
constitution,
its
constitution.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
don't
know
if
a
constitution
should
draw
along
that
line.
certainly
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well,
in
our
democratic
form
of
government
with
a
small
d,
i
think
that
it
might
be
possible
but
i'm
not
aware
that
there
is
any
said
constitutional
provision.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
oh
what
we
have
mr.
justice
douglas
as
i
understand
it
in
our
country
is
a
republican
form
of
government
which
means
that
the
people
elect
representatives
to
cast
their
ballot.
now,
that
goes
through
the
whole
hoof
and
woof
of
our
entire
system
of
states.
now,
that
requires
i
think
in
the
broad
in
our
system
of
government
in
our
political
philosophy
that
requires
that
in
our
particular
states
without
the
federal
constitution
that
we
must
provide
some
appropriate
method
of
our
interior
works.
now,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
particualrly
the
second
section
of
the
fourteenth
ammendment
does
make
some
specific
provisions
as
to
what
you
have
to
do
in
electing
both
representatives
and
senators
and
congress
and
what
you
have
to
do
also
within
your
own
state.
but
with
those
limitations
i
think
that
a
state
which
is
constitutionally
apportioned
i
think
very
defintely
that
a
state
whose
legislature
and
the
one
in
michigan
i
think
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
today.
after
they
are
properly
apportioned,
i
think
that
under
the
constitution
of
michigan
and
most
states,
the
legislature
have
the
absolute
power
to
make,
create,
and
abolish
agencies
for
its
better
government.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
the
question
of
equity
in
this
phrase
of
it
of
that
instrumentality
of
government
is
unique.go
back
to
hunter
versus
pittsburgh.
go
back
to
attorney
general
versus
lowrey.
the
people
in
those
cases
were
overwhelmed
and
had
no
right
because
in
these
transfers
of
territory
as
had
been
pointed
out,
its
analogy;
it's
a
good
analogy,
these
transfers
in
territory
that
people
have
never
had
a
right
to
vote.
now,
in
this
very
case
an
odd
thing,
there
were
35
annexations
to
the
city
of
grand
rapids
in
the
context
to
what
we're
talking
about
in
the
case
at
bar
certified
under
the
home
rule
act.
the
school
code
at
that
time
provided
that
by
reason
of
such
annexations,
that
territory
as
a
matter
of
law
became
a
part
of
the
grand
rapids
school
district.
now,
because
kentwood
was
a
new
school
district
and
there
have
been
nine
pieces
of
territory
taken
away
from
it
without
assemblance,
without
any
right
whatever
to
the
people
of
kentwood
to
be
heard
or
to
vote,
after
those
nine,
it
went
to
the
legislature
and
got
that
section
of
the
statute
up
here
so
that
today
where
there
is
an
annexation
under
the
home
rule
act
that
territory
still
stays
in
the
school
district.
now,
what
triggered
this
case,
this
piece
of
territory
was
a
part
of
kentwood.
it
was
taken
away
by
one
of
these
home
rule
annexations
without
a
vote
of
the
kentwood
school
electors.
we
went
back
immediately
because
of
the
--
the
pendencies
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
legislature
had
passed
to
appeal
but
it
hadn't
become
effective.
we
went
back
to
the
county
board
of
education
and
ask
them
not
to
take
away
from
the
grand
rapids
board
of
education
but
to
give
it
factious.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
now,
there's
another
thing.
my
brother
cites
the
1960
census,
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
mentioned
that
brambles
about
this
political
picket.
in
1960
the
figures
that
my
brother
cites,
grand
rapids
had
55%
of
the
population.
in
their
own
brief,
they
admit
that
in
1963
it
had
dropped
to
48%.
now,
i
just
--
in
the
briefs,
in
the
affidavits,
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute.
as
of
now,
as
of
now
the
20
school
districts,
there
are
21
including
grand
rapids,
the
20
school
disctricts
on
the
periphery
of
the
city
of
grand
rapids
have
not
only
a
majority
of
the
population,
more
than
50%
of
the
population,
they
have
over
17,000
more
school
children
according
to
the
1966
census,
the
1967
will
be
taken
next
month.
and
not
only
that
they
have
more
dollars
in
valuation.
so
here
we
are
today,
they
say
give
us
one
man
one
vote,
we
want
the
county
board
of
education
to
be
apportioned.
i
don't
know
how
because
they
haven't
said.
as
i
understand
it's
done
one
in
two
ways
possibly.
we'll
elect
them
at
large
or
suggest
to
the
legislature
they
create
districts.
okay,
reynolds
is
applied
to
our
situation
instead
of
any
relief
that
my
brother
and
his
client,
the
grand
rapids
board
of
education
because
they
got
more
voters
on
the
20
dic
--
districts
as
a
matter
of
politics
they
can
go
out
and
elect
all
five.
he
says
that
by
courtesy
mrs.keeler
is
a
member
of
the
board.
it
was
a
matter
of
fact
when
we
started
the
hearing
i
requested
that
she'd
not
sit
because
she
was
wearing
two
hats,
she
elected
to
sit.
a
few
years
after
that,
the
1965,
a
legislature
caught
up
with
it
to
provide
now
that
members
of
county
boards
get
sit
on
a
transfer
proposition
when
they
are
actually
members
of
both
boards.
now,
you
go
to
a
districting
proposition.
suppose
this
court
should
suggest
to
the
commission
of
legislature
or
through
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
that
what
you
should
do
misrepresented
it
that
type
of
argument
that
what
you
should
do
is
to
create
districts.
alright,
the
population
is
still
with
the
20
school
districts.
they've
got
17,000
more
school
children
and
they've
got
more
valuation
that
my
brother
talks
about
on
tax
so
unless
there
are
political
gerrymandering
as
i
read
in
the
papers
as
happening
in
some
of
these
legislative
apportionment
things
unless
they
are
gerrymandering
the
result
would
be
the
same.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
assume
that
i'm
wrong
and
the
results
so
far
is
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
that's
exactly
what
i
was
saying
your
honor
that
even
whether
it's
a
general
election
or
whether
it's
by
district
in
our
particular
case,
the
result
would
be
the
same.
and
reynolds
versus
sims
would
not
help
at
all
because
no
matter
how
you
--
no
ma
--
no
matter
how
you
consider
it
the
--
there
are
more
voters
in
the
20
school
disctrics
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
in
grand
rapids.
there
is
more
children
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
there
is
more
evaluation.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
don't
say
that,
i
don't
say
that
--
i
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well,
reynolds
versus
--
versus
sims
will
not
answer
the
problem
of
my
brother
in
the
city
in
grand
rapids
in
this
case
at
all
because
the
--
one
of
the
assumptions
of
reynolds
versus
sims
is
to
correct
an
imbalance
in
--
in
minorities,
to
--
to
help
out
minorities
to
--
to
get
the
minorites
an
equal
weighted
vote
with
which
i
agree.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
the
legislative
life
level
but
the
trouble
is
that
you
still
got
majorities.
and
what
i'm
saying
is,
that
here
is
the
odd
situation
of
a
minority
coming
up
here
and
saying,
apply
reynolds
versus
sims
because
we
want
equal
votes
and
you
give
them
equal
votes.
and
that
the
majority
is
still
is
with
the
school
districts
outside
of
grand
rapids
and
they
all
go
out
and
elect
at
large
the
five
members
of
the
board.
they
have
the
political
power.
not
only
that
you
create
districts.
i
understand
reynolds
versus
sims
the
districts
must
be
under
equal
population
if
possible
if
that
is
true
and
it
follows,
then
the
same
situation
politically
applies,
it's
done
honestly,
and
not
by
gerrymandering
because
the
majority
will
still
be
with
the
20
school
districts
in
the
outside.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
the
michigan
or
--
i'd
say
at
least
a
hundred
years
has
been
provided
in
the
general
school
laws
that
all
locals
so-called
local
board
of
education
be
elected
at
large.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
be
elected
at
large.
first
is
the
grand
rapids
board
is
a
second
class
school
district.
there
are
only
two,
the
other
city
is
flint.
and
by
the
statute
regulating
second
class
they
have
nine
members.
now,
there
was
nine
members
of
that
board
are
elected
at
large
three
at
a
time,
every
year
so
three
at
a
time
by
the
entire
city
of
grand
rapids.
now,
it
is
the
members
of
those
boards
would
get
together
and
from
their
membership
select
one
each
two
years
to
go
to
this
other
assembly
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
and
i
used
the
word
selecting
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
selecting
a
member
or
two
memebrs
of
the
county
board
of
education.
now,
my
brother
did
not
state
clearly
the
qualifications
of
the
member
of
the
county
board
of
education
is
that
he
must
be
a
tax
paying
school
electorate
of
a
district
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
county.
and
the
statute
is
i
think
very
clearly
set
up
in
the
briefs.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
it
doesn't
compell
them
at
all
as
i
understand
the
cases
and
i
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
the
solicitor
general
calls
this
a
two-step
proposition.
now,
as
as
i
understand
it
there
is
no
complaint
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
five
member
board.
the
attack
in
this
case
is
made
on
the
formation
of
the
assembly
which
does
this
election.
that
is
one
member
from
each
of
the
20
boards
would
come
every
two
years
to
a
meeting
place
to
select
one
or
two
members
of
the
county
board
whose
terms
are
expired.
now,
that's
two
states.
the
complaint
is
made
against
that
assembly,
but
the
point
is
this.
education
has
never
been
a
part
in
michigan
of
local
self
government,
never.
and
school
electors
in
michigan
have
never
had
the
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
oh!
very
definitely.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
say
so
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
think
so.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
think
so
mr.
justice
black
that
because
as
pointed
out
in
gray
versus
sanders,
that
georgians
had
a
right
to
vote.
and
in
the
fortson
case
they
said
this
is
not
a
voting
case.
in
my
position
it's
flatly
that
in
this
area
these
are
not
voting
cases.
they're
not
voting
cases
because
there
is
no
right.
there
certainly
is
no
federally
constitu
--
federally
--
federal
constitutional
right
that
to
vote
at
least
that
that
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
to
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
to
vote
in
this
--
these
elections
for
local
units
of
government
or
their
membership.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well
the
method
of
election
is
actually
only
a
selection
what
the
state
is
doing
in
that
situation
in
saying
exercising
his
power
to
determine
the
method
by
which
a
member
of
a
local
unit
of
government
will
be
selected.
now,
in
this
ins
--
instituted
by
this
particular
assembly.
now,
if
the
--
as
was
suggested
on
the
other
argument,
there's
no
question
about
what
the
michigan
legislature
tomorrow
could
say,
"well
we
will
abolish
that
assembly
and
we
will
have
every
member
of
every
county
board
of
education
in
the
state
of
michigan
appointed
by
the
government".
and
to
me
--
to
me
here
you
have
a
method
of
selection
where
you
have
educators.
they
have
to
be
interested
in
education,
the
people
who
selected
for
this
very
sensitive
fuction
of
special
education
for
handicapped
children.
this
concept
with
the
county
board
brand
new
in
michigans
that
it
was
only
established
in
19
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
no
they
wouldn't
--
they
wouldn't.
there's
no
question
about
it.
it
was
appointed
by
the
governor.
personally,
i
believe
that
the
method
of
selection
in
the
case
that
we
have
a
bar
that's
--
at
bar
that's
what
i
know
about
is
much
fairer
actually
than
to
have
these
people
appointed
by
the
governor
because
we
have
governors
of
--
in
my
state,
a
different
political
phase
every
now
and
then,
and
the
power
to
appoint
five
members
in
the
83
counties
of
michigan
is
a
power
that
i
just
hope
they
never
have.
i
take
the
practical
point
of
view
that
so
far
as
my
state
is
concerned
and
this
county
board
of
education
is
concerned,
the
method
of
selection,
the
method
of
selection
is
the
fairest
that
can
be
divided.
and
preserve
at
least
some
motive
of
--
of
a
membership
by
the
grand
rapids
board.
and
they
admit
that
they
grand
rapids
board
has
had
a
member
on
that
county
board
for
sometime
and
the
same
member
is
on
that
board
now
that
voted
against
the
transfer
initally
in
this
case.
now,
i
firmly
urge
that
in
our
case,
the
method
of
selection
is
fair.
it's
reasonable.
that
method
has
not
caused
any
disparity,
minority
situation
in
our
case
whatever.
it's
a
proper
method
of
selection
where
people
who
are
dedicated
to
education
by
serving
on
boards
of
education
get
together
to
select
the
members
of
this
county
board
which
has
its
very
sensitive
function
in
michigan
as
special
education
in
handicapped
children,
which
is
administered
on
a
countrywide
basis
without
regard
to
race,
color
or
creed
and
certainly
without
regard
to
the
district
from
which
they
come.
now,
the
1935
act
specifically
provided
that
nothing
in
this
county
board
act
or
power
should
conflict
with
the
powers
under
the
general
school
law
entertained
in
which
historically
a
local
--
so-called
local
or
constituent
board
of
education
had.
there
can
be
no
conflict.
i
don't
believe
that
there
--
is
even
such
a
conflict
that
should
be
--
could
be
resolved
by
the
state
board
of
education
because
there
isn't
that.
the
local
boards
run
schools
generally
from
kindergarten
to
the
12th
grade
except
within
the
framework
and
the
requirements
of
law
in
the
state
board
of
education
they
run
their
own
schools
according
to
what
their
lights
are
the
best
education
for
the
children.
now,
that's
entirely
distinct
in
the
part
from
the
duties
of
the
county
board
of
education.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
pardon.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
well,
its
powers
since
1935
have
been
somewhat
expanded.
when
this
case
first
started,
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
tax.
what
they
had
to
do
once
they
submit
a
budget
to
what
we
call
the
allocation
board
to
be
divided
within
the
15
mills.
recently,
primarily
because
of
this
great
thing
that
come
to
michigan
this
county
special
education
program
for
handicapped
children
which
preceded
federal
grants
and
developments
in
that
respect
in
the
county.
now,
that's
adopted
by
the
counties
by
referendum.
now,
because
of
that,
they
were
given
the
tax
power
as
i
believe
and
the
power
to
bond
for
the
purpose
of
building
facilities.
but
their
powers
mr.
chief
justice
are
limited.
the
bonding
power
is
to
the
specific
phases.
originally
they
took
the
place
of
a
county
superintendent
who
was
a
politician
run
for
office
on
a
partisan
ticket.
then
the
county
superintendent
schools
is
now
and
i
used
to
have
historically
in
every
state
i
believe
is
now
appointed
by
the
county
board.
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
it
then
they
use
to
help
the
rural
school
districts,
and
the
teachers
they
would
help
in
their
employment.
i
think
that
they
still
do
that.
they
worked
and
originally
intended
to
help
actually
the
rural
school
districts.
and
now
it
is
expanded
until
it's
true
they
do
have
the
power
to
tax
for
very
limited
purposes
are
not
broad
purposes.
they
have
--
and
the
power
to
bond
is
a
limited
power
to
only
a
bond
for
a
certain
type
of
facilities.
that
generally
mr.
chief
justice
is
their
power.
it's
something
that
is
superimposed
but
certainly
it
has
no
control
whatever
to
local
boards
of
education.
mr
justice
fortas
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
as
of
now
your
honor
there
are
only
21.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
definitely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
yes,
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
and
it's
a
more
limited
power
of
bonding
than
local
school
districts
board
of
education
has.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
oh!
definitely
not,
absolutely
not.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
that's
correct,
for
instance
the
special
education
program,
these
smaller
school
districts
in
grand
rapids.
now,
i
know
that
grand
rapids
has
had
a
handicap
program
for
many
years.
the
other
districts
weren't
wealthy
enough
to
do
it
so
the
idea
was
to
help
the
county
base,
tax
base
do
it.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
your
--
your
statement
that
the
powers
are
axuiliary
is
--
is
accurate.
that
they
are
auxiliary,
they're
not
the
same.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
it
was
organized,
the
statute
specifically
provided
that
it
was
not
intended
by
the
fact
that
it
takes
away
or
detracts
in
anyway
the
powers
of
local
boards
of
education.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
no
absolutely
not.
annexation
and
consolidation
provisions
are
under
two
different
sections.
what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case
is
the
power
to
transfer
the
upon
or
live
across
the
road
from
a
school
house
but
that
was
in
any
district
then
this
child
had
to
walk
through
the
snow
three
miles,
the
other
school
districts
so
he
would
go
some
place
to
ask
that
his
house
be
set
off
in
the
other
school
district.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
--
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
no,
it's
--
it's
by
the
reorganization
of
the
act.
mr.
paul
o.
strawhecker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
300
cases,
i
believe
the
court
is
fully
apprised
of
the
--
let
me
say
unusual
circumstances,
unique
circumstances
in
the
sailors
case.
i'm
sure
the
court
understands
thoroughly
the
constitutional
questions
that
we
raised.
now
we
have
one
peculiar
passage.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
to
the
fact
of
the
question
which
unfortunately
is
in
our
case,
is
constitutionally
insignificant
and
we
certainly
agree.
the
difficulty
is
that
the
appellants
have
brought
it
here.
it
is
one
of
their
claims
or
relief
that
the
transfer
which
triggered
this
litigation,
the
transfer
by
the
kent
county
board
of
education,
two
kentwood
public
schools
that
i
represent
(inaudible)
public
schools
is
void.
and
the
relief
i
ask
that
this
court
set
that
transfer
aside.
now,
that
means
six
and
a
half
million
dollars
of
valuation
to
my
school
district
client
and
the
fourteen
room
modern
schoolhouse.
the
three
judges
in
the
district
court
were
unanimous
that
at
least
the
body
was
a
de
facto
body
and
that
the
transfer
should
stand.
now,
whatever
else
happened
in
sailors
in
number
430?
i
urged
the
court
to
say
that
they
affirm
the
three
judges
of
the
district
court
and
place
--
prevent
the
transfer
to
stand.
one
last
word,
we
urged
that
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature
is
more
competent
to
determine
the
method
of
selecting
its
numerous
diverse
board
or
agencies
in
selecting
the
membership
of
it
in
peculiar
circumstances
that
may
exist
and
change
from
time
to
time
in
the
state
than
any
court.
