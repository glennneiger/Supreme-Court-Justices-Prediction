mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
appellant,
mr.
james
sailors
and
others
individual
plaintiffs
of
this
case
that
the
constitutional
principle
of
reynolds
versus
sims
companion
cases
related
thereto
extends
to
the
county
level
of
government.
and
on
that
basis
and
consistent
with
those
decisions
any
logic
and
in
some
policy
that
the
equal
protection
clause
extends
no
less
to
the
local
level
than
it
does
to
the
state
level.
the
facts
involved
in
this
matter
as
far
as
james
sailors
and
his
people
related
individual
plaintiffs
are
concerned
or
spouse.
under
the
1960
census,
kent
county,
the
second
largest
populous
county
in
the
state
of
michigan,
in
western
michigan
had
a
population
of
some
363,000.
the
city
of
grand
rapids
which
also
comprises
the
grand
rapids
school
district
has
a
population
of
201,000
of
those
363,000
or
some
55%,
that
after
world
war
ii
as
in
all
communities,
large
communities,
the
flight
to
suburbia
the
core
cities
became
surrounded
with
the
young
afluent
populations
who
generally
and
before
that
time
had
been
living
in
the
city
to
help
solve
the
city's
problems.
and
the
city
itself
became
the
receptacle
for
large
numbers
of
poor
culturally
deprived
people.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
plaintiff
that
in
order
to
preserve
its
tax
base,
the
plaintiff
as
a
citizen
of
the
school
district,
the
city
of
grand
rapids,
and
others
within
that
school
district
made
various
annexations
surrounding
and
this
is
rised
to
the
particular
controversy
involved.
now,
there's
a
peculiar
system
set
up
as
an
extension
of
state
government
into
the
county
level.
part
of
county
government
is
taken
cared
of
by
a
board
of
supervisors
that
handles
the
ditches,
the
roads,
and
matters
of
that
type.
and
another
part
of
state
government
delegated
to
the
county
level
provides
for
a
county
board
of
education.
now,
this
is
an
all
powerful
important
body.
in
the
city
of
michigan
under
the
appropriate
acts,
this
board
is
composed
of
five
people,
the
county
board
in
each
of
the
counties
of
the
state,
five
members
and
each
two
years
biannually.
notice
goes
out
to
each
of
the
school
districts
in
the
county,
the
individual
school
districts
in
the
county
of
which
at
the
time
of
the
origin
of
this
case
there
was
some
40
to
50
to
come
at
a
common
place
and
each
representative
of
each
of
these
school
districts
may
then
cast
its
ballot,
its
ballot
for
a
member
or
two
members
for
the
exception
of
the
third
time
around
of
the
county
board.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
popular
vote
as
such
your
honor,
mr.
justice
douglas,
is
so
set
that
the
indiviudal
voter
elector
has
voted
for
his
candidates
for
the
local
school
board.
that
local
school
board
sends
its
member
to
this
constituent
assembly
which
in
turn
elects
the
five
members
to
the
county
board.
incidentally
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
is
the
first
board
mr.
chief
justice
is
elected
at
large
in
each
case,
it
has
proportionate
representation.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yet
large
within
its
school
district.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
for
instance
as
a
resident
of
the
city
of
grand
rapids
with
some
201,000
other
people,
i
am
allowed
to
vote
for
the
nine
members
of
my
school
district.
and
that
201,000
people
school
district
representing
55%
of
the
population
of
the
whole
county
is
allowed
one
vote
as
it
casts
its
vote
for
a
member
of
the
county
board.
if
i
was
a
member
of
an
area
known
as
nelson
center,
i
would
be
coming
from
an
area
of
100
people.
i
would
be
casting
my
vote
for
the
school
board
which
reflects
my
view,
my
thought
at
the
next
county
school
board
election.
and
as
a
person
from
nelson
center,
my
vote
is
cast
for
a
member
of
the
county
school
board
equally
to
and
alongside
of
that
member
of
the
city
of
grand
rapids
school
district
that
has
201,000
people.
thus
we
have
asserted
that
the
ratio
of
imbalance
and
the
county
school
board
for
the
county
of
kent
now
known
as
the
intermediate
school
board
was
at
the
time
of
the
election
of
the
people
that
took
action
on
this
case
some
2000
to
one
between
the
grand
rapids
school
district
and
nelson
center.
that
has
now
been
corrected
all
the
way
to
900
to
1
as
we
understand.
you
say
that
it
still
a
hopeless
imbalance.
now,
the
state
of
michigan
has
delegated
educational
functions
on
the
county
level,
and
these
are
extremely
important
to
every
person
in
the
county.
the
county
board
is
stripped
down
of
all
of
its
labels
is
a
legislative
body.
it
sets
policy
for
the
entire
county.
it
has
the
power
to
tax.
it
has
the
power
to
levy
taxes
on
everybody
of
the
county.
and
at
the
time
of
the
creation
or
voting
for
the
constituent
board
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
action.
in
this
case,
2%
of
the
people
in
kent
county
could
control
the
county
board
which
would
determine
what
taxes
would
be
laid
upon
all
of
the
people
of
the
county
for
various
functions
special
education,
bonding.
furthermore,
the
county
board
is
empowered
to
set
up
a
separate
school
for
juvenile
delinquents
working
with
the
courts.
it's
a
policymaking
board
what
position
should
the
county
board
take
with
reference
to
juvenile
delinqeuncy
in
the
county
of
education
of
youth.
what
position
should
it
take
as
to
what
taxes
should
go
for
special
education
or
not.
now,
another
peculiar
twist
is
that
the
constituent
assembly,
and
by
the
constituent
assembly
we
say
that
this
one
representative
of
each
school
district
whether
it
be
the
one
representing
201,000
or
100
people
has
the
ultimate
power
under
the
act,
this
constituent
assembly,
the
ultimate
veto
power
on
the
amount
of
taxes
that
will
be
levied
by
this
county
board.
now,
we
assert
and
claim
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
sophisticated
method
of
depriving
the
people
of
equal
representation
and
although
more
so
in
this
case
because
it
has
the
power
to
tax,
because
it
has
the
power
to
bond,
because
it
imposes
obligations
on
people,
not
school
districts,
not
on
stamps,
but
on
everyone.
it
may
have
and
does
have
the
power
to
oppose
the
same
tax
on
an
elector,
a
person
who
lives
in
the
grand
rapids
school
district
whether
201,000
people
as
it
has
for
nelson
center
that
has
100
people.
and
we
submit
that
with
this
all
powerful
power
to
tax,
that
with
this
all
powerful
policymaking
legislative
body
which
it
is
in
determining
policy
in
the
county
of
kent
that
it
must
be
under
logic
commonsense
because
it
is
the
contention
of
the
appellant,
james
sailors
and
others
in
this
case.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
i
said,
i'm
sure
i
didn't
say
borrow
--
bond,
bond,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
bond
the
public.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
bond.
yes.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
which
the
court
says
it's
an
obligation
and
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
the
court
properly
understood
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
--
or
know
the
other
word,
yes.
bond,
borrow,
certainly,
obligate
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
your
honor.
now,
it
is
of
such
importance
if
both
sides
in
this
case
agree
that
it
is
a
very
important
board,
that
it
has
very
important
functions.
and
we
understand
and
we
contend
that
any
legislative
body
that
has
the
power
to
tax
and
tax
some
people
should
therefore
be
one
that
represents
people
or
the
people
should
be
permitted
to
vote
taxation-wise
or
vote
on
the
legislation
themselves,
not
an
old
town
hall
system
but
either
the
people
should
have
the
power
to
vote
on
taxes
or
the
power
to
give
direction
to
the
county
school
boards
function
to
whether
the
school
should
or
should
not
be
set
up
for
juvenile
delinquents
whether
they
should
or
should
not
have
special
education
to
provide
for
retarded
children,
and
otherwise,
either
the
people
should
have
this
direct
power
to
vote
on
it
or
its
representative
should
have
one
or
the
other.
and
that
the
people
of
the
grand
rapids
school
district
certainty
are
deprived
of
the
power
to
vote
equally
because
they
don't
have
equal
representation.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
would
make
no
difference
to
us
where
they
came
from,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
no,
it
would
not
your
honor
whether
they
came
from
grand
rapids
or
they
all
came
from
nelson
center,
if
the
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
mr.
justice
white,
one
of
them
came
from
the
city
of
grand
rapids
as
this
has
been
stated
in
the
briefs
as
a
courtesy.
they
allowed
the
city
of
grand
rapids
to
have
one.
the
other
four
came
from
out
county
and
traditionally
come
from
out
county
that
is
other
than
the
city
of
grand
rapids.
one
of
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
voted
in
this
case
to
the
annex
certain
property
from
the
grand
rapids
school
district
had
a
proposition
before
the
same
board.
and
he
moved
or
second
to
the
motion
to
deannex
a
piece
of
property
from
the
grand
rapids
school
district.
and
at
a
subsequent
meeting,
he
come
in
from
the
grandville
school
district
one
of
the
smaller
ones
was
likewise
awarded
a
piece
of
property
from
the
grand
rapids
school
district.
that
is
to
say,
proposed
or
second
the
motion
to
deannex
a
piece
of
territory
from
the
grand
rapids
school
district
on
one
occasion
and
have
pending
before
the
same
body
at
the
same
time
a
petition
to
deannex
another
piece
and
he
was
given
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
they
would.
it
would
certainly
satisfy
part
of
it
that
the
responsibility
of
the
governor
that
is
being
elected
by
all
of
the
people
as
far
as
the
people
of
the
county
of
kent
and
specifically
the
city
of
grand
rapids
school
district
is
concerned,
there
would
--
the
governor
is
accountable
to
everybody
it
would
be
a
vast
improvement
but
we
insist
that
it
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional
because
we
as
citizens
have
the
right
to
participate
in
the
election
of
those
who
impose
taxes
upon
us.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
i
could
say
very
candidly,
partially
it
would
apart
from
the
constitutional
aspects
of
saying
that
we
can't
vote
for
people
who
spread
taxes
or
levy
taxes
on
us.
at
least
the
members
of
the
kent
county
board
would
not
be
acountable
to
2
or
5
or
18%
of
the
population
for
their
reelection.
at
least
it
would
be
a
presumably
an
at
large
type
of
representation.
i
would
say
apart
from
the
power
to
tax
and
the
power
to
bond
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
solution
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
but
with
the
power
to
tax
and
bond
with
these
legislative
powers
to
lay
taxes
on
the
people
and
levy
them
and
require
everybody
to
pay
them,
i
would
submit
mr.
justice
white
that
those
rights
belong
with
the
people
to
elect
their
representatives.
now,
we
submit
that
our
county
board
of
education
or
intermediate
school
district
as
it
is
now
called
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
county
government
as
is
any
other
countywide
phase
of
government.
we
submit
that
it's
just
as
important
as
this
court
has
indicated
that
probably
education
is
the
most
important
thing
that
government
handles
on
the
local
level
these
days
and
certainly
from
the
record
the
size
of
the
budgets
and
the
amount
of
hours
and
time
and
participation
by
the
large
number
of
citizens
would
seem
to
justify
that.
we
are
told
that
we
should
go
to
the
state
legislature
and
ask
for
a
remedy
there
that
this
is
a
political
question.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
no
more
a
political
question
as
such
or
one
in
which
we
should
have
to
receive
or
redress
from
the
legislature
than
was
the
case
of
reynolds
against
sims
in
which
it
was
recognized.
then
a
great
imbalance
in
representation
may
be
corrected
before
the
courts
and
this
is
the
thing
which
we
seek
and
ask
for
in
this
case.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
as
of
today
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
21
school
districts.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
no
they
do
not.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
they
rated
by
the
size
of
the
school
board
whether
this
is
a
second
class
school
district
or
a
third
class
school
district
but
they
are
properly
independently
elected
at
large
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
no
trouble
there.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
by
the
people
in
the
district.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
five
to
nine.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
by
the
county
board
not
the
dis
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
but
it
didn't
--
by
the
individual
school
board.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
that's
right.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
that's
right,
two
at
a
time
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
but
the
fifth
one
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
no,
anyone
may
be
elected
and
this
is
an
interesting
also
wrinkle
under
the
act
that
if
a
person
wants
to
be
elected,
he
must
go
to
the
people
and
get
50
signatures
to
be
nominated.
this
is
what
we
call
an
election
that
actually
had
its
antecedents
back
in
the
people
themselves,
he
gets
50
signatures
nominating
petition
to
become
eligible
for
election
by
this
constituent
assembly
of
the
various
school
districts.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
that's
right.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
he
could
be
legally
a
member
or
not
a
member.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
whether
he's
usually
or
not
it
comes
to
mind
there
are
at
least
two
at
this
time
who
are
members
of
the
school
board
and
one
of
them
from
grand
rapids
by
courtesy.
one
of
them
i
know
of
the
grandville
school
district
which
is
one
of
those
districts.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
not
currently,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
it
has
been
phrased
to
this
court
by
my
opposition
that
nelson
center
ceased
to
exist
as
a
school
district.
just
recently
i
raised
it
for
this
reason
that
the
board
that
passed
upon
the
deannexation
that
came
up
in
this
case
was
elected.
one
of
the
boards
to
be
that
of
nelson
center,
your
honor,
and
this
is
a
posture
in
which
this
case
comes.
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
not
at
all
reluctant
to
pursue
this
question
or
observation
the
court
makes
that
we
still
have
some
18
to
20%
that
control
the
whole
majority.
population-wise
under
the
21
that
we
now
have
that
can
control
of
the
whole
county
board.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
well,
as
long
as
it's
within
the
15
mills
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
as
a
practical
matter
it
never
is
but
it
certainly
has
the
right
to
impose
taxes
up
to
the
15
mills
and
it
has
the
right
to
or
not
to
impose
a
special
half
mill
for
what
we
call
special
education
help
for
the
remedial
redeem
retarded
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
has
vast
powers
to
make
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
has
vast
power
to
empower
to
go
ahead
and
make
policy
decisions.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
one
of
the
annual
report
says
within
the
transcript
of
the
record,
the
county
school
board
superintendent
makes
the
observation.
he
said
we
are
the
people
who
should
be
acting
as
the
intermediary
for
you
local
people
to
the
state.
he
said
meaning
and
implying
quite
obviously
that
we
should
be
helping
you
solve
the
metropolitan
problems
of
this
county.
we
submit,
your
honor,
they
can't
be
solved
when
the
people
of
the
grand
rapids
school
district
can
be
deprived
of
all
representation
on
the
board.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
to
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
largely
to
run
their
own
districts.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
certainly
they
do.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
certainly
they
do.
they
have
large
powers,
the
largest
vast
powers
within
the
particular
school
district
as
are
outlined
in
legislation
in
the
transcript
of
record,
and
they
are
the
repository
of
this,
yes.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
they
have
vast
taxing
power
to
take
care
of
many
of
the
problems
that
they
have
witin
their
individual
districts.
however,
as
i
have
indicated
to
this
court
that
additional
powers
have
been
by
legislature
or
state
legislature
imposed
or
given
to
the
county
board
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
--
which
are
extremely
important
particularly
to
the
grand
rapids
school
district
in
this
case
to
help
meet,
we
submit,
20th
century
problems
that
in
the
core
city
now
occupied
by
large
numbers
of
culturally
deprived
people
that
is
it's
necessary
that
the
grand
rapids
school
district
should
have
some
sort
of
proportional
representation
so
that
this
people
who
have
the
power
to
tax,
who
have
the
power
to
make
policy
decisions,
who
have
the
power
as
the
superintendent
says,
to
be
in
appropriate
goal
between
policy-wide
between
the
local
district
and
the
state
district
to
properly
interpret
those
things
to
the
state
and
not
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
sir.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
it
does.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
cannot.
its
powers
are
supplemental
to
it.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
we
do
not,
we
do
not
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
--
we
do
not
claim
that
and
it
is
not
true.
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
do
that.
only
possibly
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
conflict
does
not
come
to
mind,
your
honor
and
i
cannot
answer
that
the
county
board
would
prevail
in
it.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
because
in
the
supplemental
powers
your
honor
on
the
matter
of
setting
up
school
for
delinquents,
that's
the
county
board
function
alone
given
to
the
county
board
and
the
matter
of
--
of
special
education
this
is
given
to
the
county
board
on
a
matter
of
policy
representing
between
the
local
school
districts
in
the
state
and
developing
policy
to
our
state
board,
this
is
given
to
the
county
board.
we
submit
that
that
is
a
vast
residue
of
power.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
say
that
the
policy
that
would
prevail
would
be
the
one
that
was
decided
by
the
state
board
of
education.
it
could
make
the
decision
of
what
was
to
prevail.
specifically
answering
your
question,
i
would
say
that
the
county
board
would
not
necessarily,
would
not
have
the
power
to
override
the
local
school
district
on
policy
matter
as
such.
what
i
was
addressing
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
can
it
--
another
word
they
can
your
honor
i
am
aware
that
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
it
has
a
power
to
go
ahead
and
build
another
high
school.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
it
has
all
of
those
powers
your
honor
to
go
right
ahead
if
they
had
the
money,
if
it
could,
if
it
would,
with
the
problems
that
it
has
with
the
core
cities
that
it
has
for
its
tax
base
of
what
it
may
have,
whether
it
may
have,
it
has
those
powers.
legally
speaking,
it
has
those
powers.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
appellant,
mr.
james
sailors
and
others
individual
plaintiffs
of
this
case
that
the
constitutional
principle
of
reynolds
versus
sims
companion
cases
related
thereto
extends
to
the
county
level
of
government.
and
on
that
basis
and
consistent
with
those
decisions
any
logic
and
in
some
policy
that
the
equal
protection
clause
extends
no
less
to
the
local
level
than
it
does
to
the
state
level.
the
facts
involved
in
this
matter
as
far
as
james
sailors
and
his
people
related
individual
plaintiffs
are
concerned
or
spouse.
under
the
1960
census,
kent
county,
the
second
largest
populous
county
in
the
state
of
michigan,
in
western
michigan
had
a
population
of
some
363,000.
the
city
of
grand
rapids
which
also
comprises
the
grand
rapids
school
district
has
a
population
of
201,000
of
those
363,000
or
some
55%,
that
after
world
war
ii
as
in
all
communities,
large
communities,
the
flight
to
suburbia
the
core
cities
became
surrounded
with
the
young
afluent
populations
who
generally
and
before
that
time
had
been
living
in
the
city
to
help
solve
the
city's
problems.
and
the
city
itself
became
the
receptacle
for
large
numbers
of
poor
culturally
deprived
people.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
plaintiff
that
in
order
to
preserve
its
tax
base,
the
plaintiff
as
a
citizen
of
the
school
district,
the
city
of
grand
rapids,
and
others
within
that
school
district
made
various
annexations
surrounding
and
this
is
rised
to
the
particular
controversy
involved.
now,
there's
a
peculiar
system
set
up
as
an
extension
of
state
government
into
the
county
level.
part
of
county
government
is
taken
cared
of
by
a
board
of
supervisors
that
handles
the
ditches,
the
roads,
and
matters
of
that
type.
and
another
part
of
state
government
delegated
to
the
county
level
provides
for
a
county
board
of
education.
now,
this
is
an
all
powerful
important
body.
in
the
city
of
michigan
under
the
appropriate
acts,
this
board
is
composed
of
five
people,
the
county
board
in
each
of
the
counties
of
the
state,
five
members
and
each
two
years
biannually.
notice
goes
out
to
each
of
the
school
districts
in
the
county,
the
individual
school
districts
in
the
county
of
which
at
the
time
of
the
origin
of
this
case
there
was
some
40
to
50
to
come
at
a
common
place
and
each
representative
of
each
of
these
school
districts
may
then
cast
its
ballot,
its
ballot
for
a
member
or
two
members
for
the
exception
of
the
third
time
around
of
the
county
board.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
popular
vote
as
such
your
honor,
mr.
justice
douglas,
is
so
set
that
the
indiviudal
voter
elector
has
voted
for
his
candidates
for
the
local
school
board.
that
local
school
board
sends
its
member
to
this
constituent
assembly
which
in
turn
elects
the
five
members
to
the
county
board.
incidentally
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
is
the
first
board
mr.
chief
justice
is
elected
at
large
in
each
case,
it
has
proportionate
representation.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yet
large
within
its
school
district.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
for
instance
as
a
resident
of
the
city
of
grand
rapids
with
some
201,000
other
people,
i
am
allowed
to
vote
for
the
nine
members
of
my
school
district.
and
that
201,000
people
school
district
representing
55%
of
the
population
of
the
whole
county
is
allowed
one
vote
as
it
casts
its
vote
for
a
member
of
the
county
board.
if
i
was
a
member
of
an
area
known
as
nelson
center,
i
would
be
coming
from
an
area
of
100
people.
i
would
be
casting
my
vote
for
the
school
board
which
reflects
my
view,
my
thought
at
the
next
county
school
board
election.
and
as
a
person
from
nelson
center,
my
vote
is
cast
for
a
member
of
the
county
school
board
equally
to
and
alongside
of
that
member
of
the
city
of
grand
rapids
school
district
that
has
201,000
people.
thus
we
have
asserted
that
the
ratio
of
imbalance
and
the
county
school
board
for
the
county
of
kent
now
known
as
the
intermediate
school
board
was
at
the
time
of
the
election
of
the
people
that
took
action
on
this
case
some
2000
to
one
between
the
grand
rapids
school
district
and
nelson
center.
that
has
now
been
corrected
all
the
way
to
900
to
1
as
we
understand.
you
say
that
it
still
a
hopeless
imbalance.
now,
the
state
of
michigan
has
delegated
educational
functions
on
the
county
level,
and
these
are
extremely
important
to
every
person
in
the
county.
the
county
board
is
stripped
down
of
all
of
its
labels
is
a
legislative
body.
it
sets
policy
for
the
entire
county.
it
has
the
power
to
tax.
it
has
the
power
to
levy
taxes
on
everybody
of
the
county.
and
at
the
time
of
the
creation
or
voting
for
the
constituent
board
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
action.
in
this
case,
2%
of
the
people
in
kent
county
could
control
the
county
board
which
would
determine
what
taxes
would
be
laid
upon
all
of
the
people
of
the
county
for
various
functions
special
education,
bonding.
furthermore,
the
county
board
is
empowered
to
set
up
a
separate
school
for
juvenile
delinquents
working
with
the
courts.
it's
a
policymaking
board
what
position
should
the
county
board
take
with
reference
to
juvenile
delinqeuncy
in
the
county
of
education
of
youth.
what
position
should
it
take
as
to
what
taxes
should
go
for
special
education
or
not.
now,
another
peculiar
twist
is
that
the
constituent
assembly,
and
by
the
constituent
assembly
we
say
that
this
one
representative
of
each
school
district
whether
it
be
the
one
representing
201,000
or
100
people
has
the
ultimate
power
under
the
act,
this
constituent
assembly,
the
ultimate
veto
power
on
the
amount
of
taxes
that
will
be
levied
by
this
county
board.
now,
we
assert
and
claim
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
sophisticated
method
of
depriving
the
people
of
equal
representation
and
although
more
so
in
this
case
because
it
has
the
power
to
tax,
because
it
has
the
power
to
bond,
because
it
imposes
obligations
on
people,
not
school
districts,
not
on
stamps,
but
on
everyone.
it
may
have
and
does
have
the
power
to
oppose
the
same
tax
on
an
elector,
a
person
who
lives
in
the
grand
rapids
school
district
whether
201,000
people
as
it
has
for
nelson
center
that
has
100
people.
and
we
submit
that
with
this
all
powerful
power
to
tax,
that
with
this
all
powerful
policymaking
legislative
body
which
it
is
in
determining
policy
in
the
county
of
kent
that
it
must
be
under
logic
commonsense
because
it
is
the
contention
of
the
appellant,
james
sailors
and
others
in
this
case.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
i
said,
i'm
sure
i
didn't
say
borrow
--
bond,
bond,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
bond
the
public.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
bond.
yes.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
which
the
court
says
it's
an
obligation
and
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
the
court
properly
understood
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
--
or
know
the
other
word,
yes.
bond,
borrow,
certainly,
obligate
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
your
honor.
now,
it
is
of
such
importance
if
both
sides
in
this
case
agree
that
it
is
a
very
important
board,
that
it
has
very
important
functions.
and
we
understand
and
we
contend
that
any
legislative
body
that
has
the
power
to
tax
and
tax
some
people
should
therefore
be
one
that
represents
people
or
the
people
should
be
permitted
to
vote
taxation-wise
or
vote
on
the
legislation
themselves,
not
an
old
town
hall
system
but
either
the
people
should
have
the
power
to
vote
on
taxes
or
the
power
to
give
direction
to
the
county
school
boards
function
to
whether
the
school
should
or
should
not
be
set
up
for
juvenile
delinquents
whether
they
should
or
should
not
have
special
education
to
provide
for
retarded
children,
and
otherwise,
either
the
people
should
have
this
direct
power
to
vote
on
it
or
its
representative
should
have
one
or
the
other.
and
that
the
people
of
the
grand
rapids
school
district
certainty
are
deprived
of
the
power
to
vote
equally
because
they
don't
have
equal
representation.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
would
make
no
difference
to
us
where
they
came
from,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
no,
it
would
not
your
honor
whether
they
came
from
grand
rapids
or
they
all
came
from
nelson
center,
if
the
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
mr.
justice
white,
one
of
them
came
from
the
city
of
grand
rapids
as
this
has
been
stated
in
the
briefs
as
a
courtesy.
they
allowed
the
city
of
grand
rapids
to
have
one.
the
other
four
came
from
out
county
and
traditionally
come
from
out
county
that
is
other
than
the
city
of
grand
rapids.
one
of
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
voted
in
this
case
to
the
annex
certain
property
from
the
grand
rapids
school
district
had
a
proposition
before
the
same
board.
and
he
moved
or
second
to
the
motion
to
deannex
a
piece
of
property
from
the
grand
rapids
school
district.
and
at
a
subsequent
meeting,
he
come
in
from
the
grandville
school
district
one
of
the
smaller
ones
was
likewise
awarded
a
piece
of
property
from
the
grand
rapids
school
district.
that
is
to
say,
proposed
or
second
the
motion
to
deannex
a
piece
of
territory
from
the
grand
rapids
school
district
on
one
occasion
and
have
pending
before
the
same
body
at
the
same
time
a
petition
to
deannex
another
piece
and
he
was
given
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
they
would.
it
would
certainly
satisfy
part
of
it
that
the
responsibility
of
the
governor
that
is
being
elected
by
all
of
the
people
as
far
as
the
people
of
the
county
of
kent
and
specifically
the
city
of
grand
rapids
school
district
is
concerned,
there
would
--
the
governor
is
accountable
to
everybody
it
would
be
a
vast
improvement
but
we
insist
that
it
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional
because
we
as
citizens
have
the
right
to
participate
in
the
election
of
those
who
impose
taxes
upon
us.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
i
could
say
very
candidly,
partially
it
would
apart
from
the
constitutional
aspects
of
saying
that
we
can't
vote
for
people
who
spread
taxes
or
levy
taxes
on
us.
at
least
the
members
of
the
kent
county
board
would
not
be
acountable
to
2
or
5
or
18%
of
the
population
for
their
reelection.
at
least
it
would
be
a
presumably
an
at
large
type
of
representation.
i
would
say
apart
from
the
power
to
tax
and
the
power
to
bond
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
solution
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
but
with
the
power
to
tax
and
bond
with
these
legislative
powers
to
lay
taxes
on
the
people
and
levy
them
and
require
everybody
to
pay
them,
i
would
submit
mr.
justice
white
that
those
rights
belong
with
the
people
to
elect
their
representatives.
now,
we
submit
that
our
county
board
of
education
or
intermediate
school
district
as
it
is
now
called
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
county
government
as
is
any
other
countywide
phase
of
government.
we
submit
that
it's
just
as
important
as
this
court
has
indicated
that
probably
education
is
the
most
important
thing
that
government
handles
on
the
local
level
these
days
and
certainly
from
the
record
the
size
of
the
budgets
and
the
amount
of
hours
and
time
and
participation
by
the
large
number
of
citizens
would
seem
to
justify
that.
we
are
told
that
we
should
go
to
the
state
legislature
and
ask
for
a
remedy
there
that
this
is
a
political
question.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
no
more
a
political
question
as
such
or
one
in
which
we
should
have
to
receive
or
redress
from
the
legislature
than
was
the
case
of
reynolds
against
sims
in
which
it
was
recognized.
then
a
great
imbalance
in
representation
may
be
corrected
before
the
courts
and
this
is
the
thing
which
we
seek
and
ask
for
in
this
case.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
as
of
today
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
21
school
districts.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
no
they
do
not.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
they
rated
by
the
size
of
the
school
board
whether
this
is
a
second
class
school
district
or
a
third
class
school
district
but
they
are
properly
independently
elected
at
large
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
no
trouble
there.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
by
the
people
in
the
district.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
five
to
nine.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
by
the
county
board
not
the
dis
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
but
it
didn't
--
by
the
individual
school
board.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
that's
right.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
that's
right,
two
at
a
time
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
but
the
fifth
one
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
no,
anyone
may
be
elected
and
this
is
an
interesting
also
wrinkle
under
the
act
that
if
a
person
wants
to
be
elected,
he
must
go
to
the
people
and
get
50
signatures
to
be
nominated.
this
is
what
we
call
an
election
that
actually
had
its
antecedents
back
in
the
people
themselves,
he
gets
50
signatures
nominating
petition
to
become
eligible
for
election
by
this
constituent
assembly
of
the
various
school
districts.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
that's
right.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
he
could
be
legally
a
member
or
not
a
member.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
whether
he's
usually
or
not
it
comes
to
mind
there
are
at
least
two
at
this
time
who
are
members
of
the
school
board
and
one
of
them
from
grand
rapids
by
courtesy.
one
of
them
i
know
of
the
grandville
school
district
which
is
one
of
those
districts.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
not
currently,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
it
has
been
phrased
to
this
court
by
my
opposition
that
nelson
center
ceased
to
exist
as
a
school
district.
just
recently
i
raised
it
for
this
reason
that
the
board
that
passed
upon
the
deannexation
that
came
up
in
this
case
was
elected.
one
of
the
boards
to
be
that
of
nelson
center,
your
honor,
and
this
is
a
posture
in
which
this
case
comes.
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
not
at
all
reluctant
to
pursue
this
question
or
observation
the
court
makes
that
we
still
have
some
18
to
20%
that
control
the
whole
majority.
population-wise
under
the
21
that
we
now
have
that
can
control
of
the
whole
county
board.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
well,
as
long
as
it's
within
the
15
mills
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
as
a
practical
matter
it
never
is
but
it
certainly
has
the
right
to
impose
taxes
up
to
the
15
mills
and
it
has
the
right
to
or
not
to
impose
a
special
half
mill
for
what
we
call
special
education
help
for
the
remedial
redeem
retarded
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
has
vast
powers
to
make
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
has
vast
power
to
empower
to
go
ahead
and
make
policy
decisions.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
one
of
the
annual
report
says
within
the
transcript
of
the
record,
the
county
school
board
superintendent
makes
the
observation.
he
said
we
are
the
people
who
should
be
acting
as
the
intermediary
for
you
local
people
to
the
state.
he
said
meaning
and
implying
quite
obviously
that
we
should
be
helping
you
solve
the
metropolitan
problems
of
this
county.
we
submit,
your
honor,
they
can't
be
solved
when
the
people
of
the
grand
rapids
school
district
can
be
deprived
of
all
representation
on
the
board.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
to
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
largely
to
run
their
own
districts.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
certainly
they
do.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
certainly
they
do.
they
have
large
powers,
the
largest
vast
powers
within
the
particular
school
district
as
are
outlined
in
legislation
in
the
transcript
of
record,
and
they
are
the
repository
of
this,
yes.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
they
have
vast
taxing
power
to
take
care
of
many
of
the
problems
that
they
have
witin
their
individual
districts.
however,
as
i
have
indicated
to
this
court
that
additional
powers
have
been
by
legislature
or
state
legislature
imposed
or
given
to
the
county
board
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
--
which
are
extremely
important
particularly
to
the
grand
rapids
school
district
in
this
case
to
help
meet,
we
submit,
20th
century
problems
that
in
the
core
city
now
occupied
by
large
numbers
of
culturally
deprived
people
that
is
it's
necessary
that
the
grand
rapids
school
district
should
have
some
sort
of
proportional
representation
so
that
this
people
who
have
the
power
to
tax,
who
have
the
power
to
make
policy
decisions,
who
have
the
power
as
the
superintendent
says,
to
be
in
appropriate
goal
between
policy-wide
between
the
local
district
and
the
state
district
to
properly
interpret
those
things
to
the
state
and
not
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
sir.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes,
it
does.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
cannot.
its
powers
are
supplemental
to
it.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
we
do
not,
we
do
not
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
it
--
we
do
not
claim
that
and
it
is
not
true.
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
do
that.
only
possibly
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
conflict
does
not
come
to
mind,
your
honor
and
i
cannot
answer
that
the
county
board
would
prevail
in
it.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
because
in
the
supplemental
powers
your
honor
on
the
matter
of
setting
up
school
for
delinquents,
that's
the
county
board
function
alone
given
to
the
county
board
and
the
matter
of
--
of
special
education
this
is
given
to
the
county
board
on
a
matter
of
policy
representing
between
the
local
school
districts
in
the
state
and
developing
policy
to
our
state
board,
this
is
given
to
the
county
board.
we
submit
that
that
is
a
vast
residue
of
power.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
say
that
the
policy
that
would
prevail
would
be
the
one
that
was
decided
by
the
state
board
of
education.
it
could
make
the
decision
of
what
was
to
prevail.
specifically
answering
your
question,
i
would
say
that
the
county
board
would
not
necessarily,
would
not
have
the
power
to
override
the
local
school
district
on
policy
matter
as
such.
what
i
was
addressing
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
can
it
--
another
word
they
can
your
honor
i
am
aware
that
--
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
it
has
a
power
to
go
ahead
and
build
another
high
school.
mr.
wendell
a.
miles
yes
it
has
all
of
those
powers
your
honor
to
go
right
ahead
if
they
had
the
money,
if
it
could,
if
it
would,
with
the
problems
that
it
has
with
the
core
cities
that
it
has
for
its
tax
base
of
what
it
may
have,
whether
it
may
have,
it
has
those
powers.
legally
speaking,
it
has
those
powers.
thank
you,
your
honor.
