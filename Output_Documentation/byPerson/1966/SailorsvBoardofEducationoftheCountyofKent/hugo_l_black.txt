black
i
think
we
need
to
hold
what
is
political
picketing.
justice

l.
black
to
the
better
or
worse.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
your
michigan
laws
provide
for
election
of
school
board
all
over
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
elected
by?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
you
would
say
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
not
compel
them
to
have
this
election.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
be
the
basis
of
your
argument
but
supposedly
it
has
the
election.
suppose
the
law,
stick
to
the
same
election
then
it
can
be
discriminated
against
the
voters
on
the
ground
of
equal
protection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
protected,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
make
any
difference
in
the
consitutional
question
here
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
they're
not
equal
protection
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
there
any
election
in
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
held
voting
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
there's
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
vote,
duty
to
vote,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
is
not
protected.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
suppose
there's
no
federal
constitutional
right
vote
but
the
state
thinks
this
is
an
election,
what
then
about
the
requirements
have
you
considered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
do
you
stand
on
the
sailor
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
say,
reversed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
--
was
it
appointed
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
school
district
board
is
elected.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
was
an
equalization
board
that
was
selected
in
this
manner,
would
you
rule
that
that
was
under
reynolds
and
sims?
justice
hugo
l.
black
equalization
board,
tax
equalization
board,
to
see
if
whether
or
not
my
tax
isn't
yours
if
--
they're
and

justice

that's
what
the
