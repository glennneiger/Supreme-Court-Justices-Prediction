mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
an
initial
manner
i'd
like
to
state
that
the
court
should
lay
the
facts
in
the
case
that
you
just
heard
on
our
view
of
the
more
complicated
of
the
four
cases
before
the
court,
and
in
our
view
also
the
case
is
the
most
difficult
of
the
four
involving
local
government
apportionment.
all
of
the
cases
from
the
government's
point
of
view
involved
one
overwriting
and
submitting
an
issue
and
that
is
simply
stated
whether
the
equal
population
requirement
of
reynolds
versus
sims
and
other
cases
that
relate
to
state
legislative
apportionment
also
apply
at
the
local
level
of
government.
our
interest
in
these
four
cases
stems
from
our
view
that
the
issue,
principal
issue
involved
is
one
of
importance
to
millions
of
americans
and
that
the
case
--
the
case
has
really
involved
fundamental
right
to
fair
and
equal
treatment
in
the
electoral
process
of
the
local
level.
as
an
initial
matter
since
the
facts
and
only
the
michigan
school
board
case
have
been
stated
to
the
court,
i
feel
that
in
order
to
discuss
all
four
of
the
cases
which
i
shall
do
subsequently,
i
should
first
briefly
summarize
the
facts
in
the
other
three
cases.
two
of
them
numbers
491
and
624
involved
county
governing
boards.
number
491
involves
the
board
of
supervisors
of
suffolk
county,
new
york.
that
board
was
composed
prior
to
the
holding
of
the
court
below
of
10
members
who
were
elected
from
the
10
towns
which
comprised
the
county.
each
supervisor
had
one
vote.
the
towns
vary
in
population
from
172,000
to
1300
under
the
1960
census.
that
results
in
a
population
variance
ratio
of
an
excess
of
100
to
1.
the
board
functions
as
a
policy
determining
vying
the
county
and
it
firmly
has
substantial
governmental
powers.
there's
no
dispute
about
that
the
suffolk
county
did.
the
three-judge
federal
court
below
held
the
district
and
scheme
unconstitutional
and
ordered
a
weighted
voting
plan,
weighted
insofar
as
to
weight
of
the
votes
of
the
supervisors
into
the
temporary
effect.
the
other
county
court
case
number
624
comes
from
alabama.
it
involves
the
board
of
revenue
and
control
of
houston
county,
alabama.
only
one
of
the
five
elected
members
of
that
board,
there
are
six
members.
the
sixth
is
the
probate
judge
in
the
county
who
serves
ex
officio
in
votes
when
there's
a
tie.
only
one
of
the
five
elected
members
of
that
board
is
elected
from
the
city
of
dothan,
alabama
which
contains
about
60%
of
the
total
population
of
houston
county.
there
are
claims
to
the
contrary
as
to
the
powers
of
the
board
but
i
think
upon
analysis
explained
that
the
board
exercises
and
performs
important
governmental
functions
in
houston
county.
its
apportionment
is
prescribed
by
state
statute
unlike
the
situation
in
the
suffolk
county
case
where
the
charter
prescribes
for
it.
but
it
is
a
state
statute
limited
in
that
--
in
this
application
to
houston
county
alone.
the
three-judge
court
that
was
convened
in
the
alabama
case
determined
not
to
speculate
about
whether
reynolds
would
be
applied
at
the
local
level
and
dismissed
the
suit
splitting
to
one.
but
it
also
indicated
that
on
the
merits,
the
majority
fe
--
felt
that
reynolds
should
not
be
applied
at
the
local
level.
district
judge
johnson
dissented.
the
fourth
remaining
case,
number
724,
comes
from
virginia
beach,
virginia.
it's
on
appeal
from
the
fourth
circuit
unlike
the
other
three
cases
of
which
come
from
three-judge
district
courts.
under
the
scheme
involved
for
electing
members
of
the
city
council
of
virginia
beach,
all
11
councilmen
are
elected
at
large.
however,
under
a
plan
that's
called
the
seven-four
plan.seven
of
the
11
members
are
required
to
live
in
residence
districts
which
are
prescribed
by
the
city
council
charter
which
are
grossly
disproportioned
in
population.
the
largest
has
about
30,000
people
in
it.
the
smallest
residence
district
is
about
700.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
that's
right.
they're
all
elected
--
all
11
are
elected
at
large.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
and
the
other
four,
also
can
live
anywhere
in
the
--
in
the
city.
the
seven
are
required
to
live
and
prescribed
residence
districts,
and
the
other
four
can
live
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
right,
and
the
court
have
ordered
in
the
city
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
the
fourth
circuit
held
a
plan
invalid
reversing
the
single
judge
district
court
concluding
that
the
large
beach
area
which
was
mainly
relied
upon
didn't
save
the
plan.
thus,
in
our
view
these
four
cases
involved
three
of
the
most
basic
and
common
forms
of
local
government,
county
governing
boards,
city
councils,
and
school
board.
and
i
think
considered
together
present
a
good
vehicle
for
discussing
the
constitutional
question
that
we
feel
is
the
principal
issue
here
raised.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
defer
in
the
main
of
the
brief
to
the
discussion
of
jurisdictional
question,
but
we
point
out
that
in
our
view
into
the
cases
there
is
some
question
about
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
on
direct
appeal
under
section
1253.
section
1253
says
that
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court's
decision
granting
or
denying
an
injunction
lies
that
the
case
was
the
one
required
to
be
heard
by
three
judges.
now,
in
our
view
the
basic
jurisdictional
statute
with
three-judge
courts
2281,
has
been
construed
by
this
court
as
relating
only
to
situations
that
involved
statutes
of
general
statewide
application.
and
we
have
difficulty
although
arguments
to
the
contrary
are
made
in
the
suffolk
county
case
and
in
the
alabama
case
concluding
that
on
the
basis
of
that
construction
of
2281
statutes
of
general
statewide
application
that
either
of
the
suffolk
county
charter
or
the
specific
statute
relating
to
houston
county,
alabama
fit
within
that
category.
arguments
are
made
to
the
contrary
and
i
assume
will
be
made
by
the
--
for
the
parties
but
we
have
--
we've
raised
this
question
and
as
to
the
other
two
cases
that
we
feel
jurisdiction
is
appropriate,
we
think
that
in
response
to
the
court's
question
in
number
724,
that
the
answer
to
that
question
of
whether
a
three-judge
court
should
have
been
convened
is
no,
it
should
not
have
been
convened
as
the
court
undoubtedly
know
that
it
was
initially
convened
and
then
circuit
judge
bryan
wrote
an
opinion
determining
that
the
matter
was
local
in
nature
and
the
three-judge
court
was
not
required.
we
feel
that
the
procedure
there
was
proper,
the
fourth
circuit
has
jurisdiction
and
the
case
is
properly
here
on
appeal
from
the
fourth
circuit.
now,
in
view
of
the
government
there
can
really
be
but
one
answer
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
reynolds
applied
to
its
local
level?
and
that
is
that
it
does.
it
seems
to
us
that
as
an
initial
matter,
this
simply
close
logically
from
the
basic
constitutional
underpinnings
of
reynolds.
we
don't
just
rely
on
logic.
it
seems
to
us
also
that
sound
policy
considerations
argue
for
this
result
as
well.
you
have
heard
to
some
extent
well
here
i
supposed
some
horrible
arguments
about
how
many
bodies
are
involved.
we
realized
how
many
are
involved
and
we've
attempted
in
our
brief
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
nevertheless
we
feel
that
the
principle
insofar
as
the
question
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
decision-making,
the
matter
is
manageable
by
the
courts.
i'd
like
to
make
clear
our
basic
constitutional
position.
it's
simply
this.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
there's
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
elect
local
bodies.
that's
justice
black
had
pointed
out.
it's
not
the
question
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
no,
we
think
that
the
school
board
case
just
argued
is
properly
here
also.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
the
statute
there
was
one
that
related
to
all
such
bodies
throughout
the
state
and
not
just
to
--
and
as
we
construed
the
--
the
case
is
under
2281,
that's
a
state
statute
filling
up
the
--
our
basic
position
is
this
where
members
of
the
local
governmental
body
are
under
state
or
local
law
elected,
not
appointed
and
where
directly
or
indirectly
they're
elected
from
districts
and
where
the
body
is
one
that
is
intended
to
be
representative
in
nature,
that
in
no
circumstances,
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
that
the
districts
established
and
be
substantially
equal
in
population
or
that
some
alternative
arrangement
that
coincides
with
that
basic
principle
be
established.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
in
the
first
place
is
--
is
i'm
sure
you
realize
you
--
you
don't
reach
those
in
these
cases.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
we
don't
have
any
--
any
basic
disagreement
with
proportional
representation
system
so
long
as
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
no,
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
well,
it
--
it
requires
the
--
it
requires
the
majority
rule
in
the
sense
that
where
there
is
a
districting
scheme,
it
requires
that
those
districts
should
be
set
up
on
a
--
on
equal
population
basis.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
constitutionally
is
to
a
proportional
representation
scheme
which
attempts
to
treat
all
voters
equally
and
yet
ensure
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
the
new
york
city
council
situation
is
somewhat
relevant
to
a
case
called
(inaudible)
versus
wagner,
i
believe,
that
came
up
and
involves
a
scheme
where
the
at
large
to
at
large
members
of
the
city
council
are
required
to
be
from
different
political
parties.
the
court
dismissed
the
appeal
several
years
ago
and
--
and
that
was
initially
tested.
and
subsequently
another
challenge
to
the
scheme
was
upheld.
i
think
those
questions
are
very
difficult
ones.
i
don't
think
the
position
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
i
think
it
depends
on
how
far
you
--
how
far
you
push
--
pushed
the
principle.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
as
the
cases
that
--
that
are
before
the
court,
they
don't
draw
any
of
those
schemes.
and
in
our
view
all
of
them
are
covered
by
principle
that
--
that
we
stated
in
--
in
the
brief
that
we
derived
from
reynolds.
now,
when
an
appropriate
case
comes
along
that
involves
one
of
those
kinds
of
schemes,
i
think
the
question
then
is
going
to
be
whether
the
principles
established
in
reynolds
and
the
equal
protection
clause
principles
generally
are
such
that
--
that
that's
sort
of
scheme
will
be
condoned
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
think
it
depe
--
it
depends
on
the
particular
arrangement
that
you
have
and
how
much
of
a
voice
that
you
give
in.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
well
it
seems
to
me
that
consistent
with
reynolds
it's
rather
difficult
to
make
out
reasons
for
supporting
such
an
approach.
there
are
an
infinite
variety
of
all
these
kinds
of
bodies
and
schemes.
but
reynolds,
of
course,
construed
the
equal
protection
clause
insofar
as
the
individual
voter's
right
is
concerned.
and
it's
the
same
individual
voter
in
the
--
in
the
local
election
in
the
--
as
it
is
in
the
state
law.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
i
think
that's
right
but
i
--
but
--
but
reynolds,
he
asked
about
proportional
representation
schemes.
and
i
don't
think
that
reynolds
speaks
necessarily
proportional
representation
schemes.
illinois
for
instance
has
had
an
arrangement
in
which
you
had
something
like
proportional
representation
scheme.
i
don't
think
that
was
drawn
out
by
the
--
by
the
lower
court
or
by
this
court
in
reviewing
that
case.
in
our
view
where
members
of
these
local
bodies
are
appointed
instead
of
elected
or
whether
they're
elected
at
large
rather
than
from
districts,
we
feel
that
the
equal
protection
--
equal
population
principle
announced
in
reynolds
would
be
inapplicable.
all
of
the
four
bodies
in
our
view
that
are
involved
here
fit
within
the
category
of
those
covered
by
the
principle,
and
we
submit
that
includes
the
city
council
in
number
724
where
at
large
elections
are
held
but
unequally
populated
residence
districts
are
set
up.
and
it
includes
also
the
school
board
in
number
430
despite
the
difficulties
with
the
two-step
election
scheme
that
is
presented
there.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
well
it
wasn't
really
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
as
we
understand,
it
wasn't
an
annexation
--
it
wasn't
an
annexation.
probably
(voice
overlap)
yes,
because,
yes,
because
the
city
of
norfolk
was
proposing
to
move
under
virginia
beach
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
it's
clear
that
to
some
extent,
the
original
--
the
original
city
council
that
was
set
up
here
was
not
under
the
seven-four
plan.
it
took
the
six
sitting
former
supervisors
and
put
them
on
the
council
and
the
five
city
council
members
of
virginia
beach,
and
put
them
on
the
council.
it's
clear
that
there
--
there
was
a
relationship
between
the
adoption
of
that
scheme
and
an
attempt
to
get
both
of
the
former
bodies
to
go
along
with.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
wouldn't
go
ahead
without
that
because
the
overwriting
concerns
seem
to
be
avoiding
annexation
by
the
city
of
norfolk.
as
an
initial
matter
in
our
view
that
there
can
be
no
serious
questions
that
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
generally
to
action
at
the
local
as
well
as
the
state
level
cooper
and
aaron,
come
in,
in
light
what
it
seemed
to
us
established
that
beyond
doubt.
and
nor
do
we
think
that
it'd
be
seriously
contended
the
court
has
already
decided
this
question.
some
suggestions
have
made
that
several
per
curiam
indicate
the
court
feels
that
the
question
of
local
apportionment
is
one
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
get
involved
in.
we
don't
read
those
cases
that
way
and
noting
of
jurisdiction
in
these
cases
it
seems
to
me
makes
clear
that
that's
not
the
position
the
court
has
taken.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
continue
from
yesterday,
i'd
like
for
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
reynolds
versus
sims.
now
reynolds
and
its
companions
were
of
course
state
legislative
cases
and
the
cases
before
the
court
presently
are
--
involved
local
governmental
bodies.
but
in
our
view,
reynolds
was
grounded
on
the
basic
principle
that
the
citizen's
vote
could
not
be
debased
or
deluded
in
effect
on
the
basis
where
he
resides.
and
that
they
touched
on
a
democratic
government
as
equal
representation
for
equal
numbers
of
people.
now
in
our
view,
those
basic
constitutional
principles
are
just
as
applicable
at
the
local
level
as
they
are
at
the
state
level.
it
seems
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
at
least
prima
facie
every
time
you
have
a
situation
in
which
a
body
is
elected
under
state
law
by
the
people.
and
the
members
of
that
body
are
elected
from
districts.
that
those
districts
should
be
substantially
full
in
population
or
that
an
equivalent
arrangement
which
would
accord
appropriate
weight
to
the
votes
be
established.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
think
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
may
reach
a
point
where
some
concept
of
de
minimis
is
involved
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
judgment
for
the
states
and
the
local
bodies
to
make.
if
they
decide
that
they
want
to
have
the
body
elected,
presumably
it's
supposed
to
represent
the
constituency
that's
electing
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
functions
are
important.
i
think
the
difficulty
has
to
do
with
setting
up
some
workable
criteria.
how
do
you
decide
whether
a
body
is
legislative
or
quasi
legislative?
it
seems
to
me
that
a
rule
that
would
subscribe
only
bodies
exercising
something
like
substantial
or
important
or
basic
governmental
powers
could
be
evolved.
but
the
problem
of
trying
to
apply
that
rule
in
each
individual
case
it
seems
to
me
would
be
a
never
ending
one.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
state
of
a
local
body
decides
that
its
members
are
going
to
be
elected
and
they're
going
to
be
elected
from
districts,
then
they've
made
a
judgment
that
that
body
is
intended
to
be
representative
of
the
electorate.
and
if
they
feel
that
it's
important
enough
to
handle
it
that
way
and
the
people
feel
that
it's
important
enough
to
handle
it
that
way,
then
i'd
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
court
should
go
along
with
that
judgment.
and
now
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
if
they
disagree
and
they
want
to
have
it
appointed
or
they
want
it
elect
at
some
other
way
at
large
or
whatever,
then
that's
open
to
them
under
the
way
that
we
view
these
cases.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
isn't
is
--
i
don't
think
it's
substantial
problems
that
might
first
appear
because
as
we
point
out
the
bodies
that
are
elected
and
are
elected
from
districts
are
generally
those
bodies
that
perform
important
substantial
governmental
functions.
then
as
you
shade
off
into
bodies
that
various
kinds
of
special
districts,
particularly
those
who
would
like
taxing
power,
they're
generally
not
elected
from
districts
anyhow.
very
few
of
them
are.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
body's
functions
are
quite
limited
in
the
sailors
case
and
we
don't
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
so
inflexible,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
before
it
would
apply,
a
judgment
has
to
be
made
at
the
state
or
at
the
local
level
that
this
body
will
be
composed
to
members
elected
or
chosen
in
a
way
that
would
indicate
that
the
intention
is
that
it'd
be
a
body
that
represents
the
people
that
it'd
be
elected.
and
they
don't
have
to
do
it
that
way.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
they
could
set
it
up
anyway
they
want
to.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
when
you
get
to
a
special
function
district
such
as
a
conservancy
or
a
sewerage
or
a
drainage
district,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
isn't
out
of
the
question,
if
a
rational
basis
is
ordered
by
the
state
in
setting
the
thing
up
to
allow
some
deviations
from
a
population
basis.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
until
you
reach
a
position
in
which
you
have
a
rational
basis
established,
and
shown,
and
demonstrated,
then
as
a
prima
facie
matter
that
these
bodies
as
well
as
the
general
function
bodies
should
be
covered
by
the
equal
population
principles
so
long
as
they're
elected
from
districts.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
developed
in
our
brief
in
a
section
directed
towards
special
districts,
several
pages
of
various
distinctions
that
might
be
suggested
or
made.
we
say
in
that
part
of
the
brief
that
in
our
view,
as
a
prima
facie
matter
where
they're
elected
from
districts,
we
feel
that
the
principle
ought
to
apply.
what
i
said
is
that
if
a
state
in
a
given
situation
of
a
special
function
district
can
show
that
it's
set
up
in
a
particular
way
that
it
deviates
to
some
extent
from
population
because
the
impact
of
the
body,
when
it
does,
relates
to
certain
people
living
in
one
part
of
the
area
in
a
different
way
than
it
does
to
those
living
elsewhere,
then
i
think
that
question
is
open.
and
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i'd
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
wouldn't
slide
that
quickly
into
saying
that
they
should
therefore
have
one
representative
from
each
school
district.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
that
if
the
body
has,
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
the
body
has
taxing
power
overall
the
people.
and
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
say
that
they
can
do
this
thing.
the
kind
of
bodies
that
i'm
really
talking
about
are
ones
that
based
--
board
qualifications
on
things
like
property
ownership.
some
of
these
districts,
it
seems
to
me,
that
--
that
may
makes
--
that
they
may
make
some
sense
because
the
impact
of
their
action
is
on
people
that
own
property.
and
their
taxing
power
relates
to
people
that
own
property
and
not
to
the
elected
generally.
but
i
had
--
i
have
great
difficulty
with
the
hypothetical
that
you've
posed
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
a
necessary
conclusion
that
you
represent
each
school
district
just
because
some
of
the
school
districts
may
have
unique
problems.
you
may
ensure
that
some
of
them
that
have
these
unique
problems
have
some
representations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
there
may
be
some
in
limited
situations
of
special
function
bodies.
i
don't
think
any
of
that's
before
the
court
presently
but
obviously,
these
decisions
are
going
to
bear
upon
those
questions
also,
i
suppose.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
pretty
close
to
the
middle.
we
feel
that
unbalanced
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
i
think
it's
a
very
close
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
board
was
appointed.
the
statutory
scheme
there
it
says
that
this
assembly
elects
the
body
in
a
nominating
arrangement
is
such
that
it
follows
an
election
sort
of
pattern.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
squarely,
the
people
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
sir?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
they
select
a
representative
that
meets
with
the
representatives
of
the
other
school
districts
and
selects
the
five
board
members.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
kind
of
board,
sir?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
probably
not
because
i
would
--
i'd
think
that
--
that
as
an
initial
matter,
your
question
whether
that
board
was
intended
to
be
a
representative
of
the
people
on
the
first
place.
and
that's
the
difficult
question
it
seems
to
me
of
the
sailors
case
in
the
elections
scheme
that
exists
there.
they
argue
that
the
county
board
is
supposed
to
be
representative
of
the
school
districts.
and
therefore,
since
there
isn't
any
right
to
vote
conferred
by
state
law,
their
--
the
reynolds
principle
doesn't
apply.
i
think
its
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
they
can't.
i
think
that's
quite
clear,
there
are
enough
persons.
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
danger
in
that
case.
the
danger
lies
in
sanctioning
this
kind
of
two-step
election
arrangement
because
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
if
a
state
decided
to
set
its
state
legislative
apportionment
of
this
way.
suppose
a
state
said
that
each
county
clerk
shall
meet
together
and
pick
the
members
of
a
legislature,
i
would
have
some
difficulty
with
that.
and
i
also
have
some
difficulty
in
distinguishing
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i
don't
know
how
different
it
is.
they
would
be
elected
by
the
people
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
sailors
is
a
close
and
difficult
case.
and
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
if
the
court
is
concerned
about
the
two-step
election
scheme
that
exist
there
that
we
would
submit
that
nevertheless,
most
school
boards
are
directly
elected
by
the
people.
and
that
they
at
least
should
be
covered
by
the
equal
population
principle
where
they're
elected
from
districts.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
where
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
where
the
court
started
but
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
court
went
beyond
that
in
reynolds
and
the
companion
cases
and
determined
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
it's
almost
impossible
to
decide
that.
you
end
up
with
--
you
know,
you
start
backing
of
as
to
what
it
does
and
pretty
soon
you're
--
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
know
what
you
mean,
the
principle
would
apply.
if
he's
elected
statewide,
i
assume
he's
elected
at
large.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
gray
versus
sanders
takes
care
of
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
but
as
a
policy
matter,
i
think
it's
difficult
to
--
even
if
it
didn't
try
to
draw
these
lines
between
what
does
the
local
level's
legislative
and
what
is
not.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
in
a
fairly
stance
of
footnote
that
there
has
been
some
litigation
involving
this
question.
i
don't
think
that
in
a
general,
the
parlance,
judges
are
intended
to
be
representative
even
if
they
are
elected.
i
think
it's
a
difficult
problem.
i
personally
would
come
out
holding
that
the
equal
population
principle
does
not
apply.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
i
would
say
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
say
that
it
would
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
apply,
no,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
as
i
said,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
make
a
judgment
when
you
get
out
on
the
extremes
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
not
that
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
whether
the
body
or
the
board
of
the
office
is
one
that
--
it
is
intended
to
be
a
representative
office.
so
that
there
is
the
relation
between
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
representative
means
that
that
the
state
has
made
a
judgment
that
there
is
a
--
is
the
kind
of
relationship
between
the
voter
and
the
powers
of
the
body
or
the
person.
thus,
that
this
person
acts
in
some
respects
in
the
place
of
the
individual,
the
voter,
and
i
don't
think
we
think
that
judges
do
that.
i
hope
we
don't.
and
that's
the
way
the
third
circuit
came
out
in
one
of
these
cases
but
--
i
don't
know.
i
think
those
are
difficult
questions
and
they're
at
the
extreme
difference.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
an
initial
manner
i'd
like
to
state
that
the
court
should
lay
the
facts
in
the
case
that
you
just
heard
on
our
view
of
the
more
complicated
of
the
four
cases
before
the
court,
and
in
our
view
also
the
case
is
the
most
difficult
of
the
four
involving
local
government
apportionment.
all
of
the
cases
from
the
government's
point
of
view
involved
one
overwriting
and
submitting
an
issue
and
that
is
simply
stated
whether
the
equal
population
requirement
of
reynolds
versus
sims
and
other
cases
that
relate
to
state
legislative
apportionment
also
apply
at
the
local
level
of
government.
our
interest
in
these
four
cases
stems
from
our
view
that
the
issue,
principal
issue
involved
is
one
of
importance
to
millions
of
americans
and
that
the
case
--
the
case
has
really
involved
fundamental
right
to
fair
and
equal
treatment
in
the
electoral
process
of
the
local
level.
as
an
initial
matter
since
the
facts
and
only
the
michigan
school
board
case
have
been
stated
to
the
court,
i
feel
that
in
order
to
discuss
all
four
of
the
cases
which
i
shall
do
subsequently,
i
should
first
briefly
summarize
the
facts
in
the
other
three
cases.
two
of
them
numbers
491
and
624
involved
county
governing
boards.
number
491
involves
the
board
of
supervisors
of
suffolk
county,
new
york.
that
board
was
composed
prior
to
the
holding
of
the
court
below
of
10
members
who
were
elected
from
the
10
towns
which
comprised
the
county.
each
supervisor
had
one
vote.
the
towns
vary
in
population
from
172,000
to
1300
under
the
1960
census.
that
results
in
a
population
variance
ratio
of
an
excess
of
100
to
1.
the
board
functions
as
a
policy
determining
vying
the
county
and
it
firmly
has
substantial
governmental
powers.
there's
no
dispute
about
that
the
suffolk
county
did.
the
three-judge
federal
court
below
held
the
district
and
scheme
unconstitutional
and
ordered
a
weighted
voting
plan,
weighted
insofar
as
to
weight
of
the
votes
of
the
supervisors
into
the
temporary
effect.
the
other
county
court
case
number
624
comes
from
alabama.
it
involves
the
board
of
revenue
and
control
of
houston
county,
alabama.
only
one
of
the
five
elected
members
of
that
board,
there
are
six
members.
the
sixth
is
the
probate
judge
in
the
county
who
serves
ex
officio
in
votes
when
there's
a
tie.
only
one
of
the
five
elected
members
of
that
board
is
elected
from
the
city
of
dothan,
alabama
which
contains
about
60%
of
the
total
population
of
houston
county.
there
are
claims
to
the
contrary
as
to
the
powers
of
the
board
but
i
think
upon
analysis
explained
that
the
board
exercises
and
performs
important
governmental
functions
in
houston
county.
its
apportionment
is
prescribed
by
state
statute
unlike
the
situation
in
the
suffolk
county
case
where
the
charter
prescribes
for
it.
but
it
is
a
state
statute
limited
in
that
--
in
this
application
to
houston
county
alone.
the
three-judge
court
that
was
convened
in
the
alabama
case
determined
not
to
speculate
about
whether
reynolds
would
be
applied
at
the
local
level
and
dismissed
the
suit
splitting
to
one.
but
it
also
indicated
that
on
the
merits,
the
majority
fe
--
felt
that
reynolds
should
not
be
applied
at
the
local
level.
district
judge
johnson
dissented.
the
fourth
remaining
case,
number
724,
comes
from
virginia
beach,
virginia.
it's
on
appeal
from
the
fourth
circuit
unlike
the
other
three
cases
of
which
come
from
three-judge
district
courts.
under
the
scheme
involved
for
electing
members
of
the
city
council
of
virginia
beach,
all
11
councilmen
are
elected
at
large.
however,
under
a
plan
that's
called
the
seven-four
plan.seven
of
the
11
members
are
required
to
live
in
residence
districts
which
are
prescribed
by
the
city
council
charter
which
are
grossly
disproportioned
in
population.
the
largest
has
about
30,000
people
in
it.
the
smallest
residence
district
is
about
700.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
that's
right.
they're
all
elected
--
all
11
are
elected
at
large.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
and
the
other
four,
also
can
live
anywhere
in
the
--
in
the
city.
the
seven
are
required
to
live
and
prescribed
residence
districts,
and
the
other
four
can
live
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
right,
and
the
court
have
ordered
in
the
city
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
the
fourth
circuit
held
a
plan
invalid
reversing
the
single
judge
district
court
concluding
that
the
large
beach
area
which
was
mainly
relied
upon
didn't
save
the
plan.
thus,
in
our
view
these
four
cases
involved
three
of
the
most
basic
and
common
forms
of
local
government,
county
governing
boards,
city
councils,
and
school
board.
and
i
think
considered
together
present
a
good
vehicle
for
discussing
the
constitutional
question
that
we
feel
is
the
principal
issue
here
raised.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
defer
in
the
main
of
the
brief
to
the
discussion
of
jurisdictional
question,
but
we
point
out
that
in
our
view
into
the
cases
there
is
some
question
about
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
on
direct
appeal
under
section
1253.
section
1253
says
that
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court's
decision
granting
or
denying
an
injunction
lies
that
the
case
was
the
one
required
to
be
heard
by
three
judges.
now,
in
our
view
the
basic
jurisdictional
statute
with
three-judge
courts
2281,
has
been
construed
by
this
court
as
relating
only
to
situations
that
involved
statutes
of
general
statewide
application.
and
we
have
difficulty
although
arguments
to
the
contrary
are
made
in
the
suffolk
county
case
and
in
the
alabama
case
concluding
that
on
the
basis
of
that
construction
of
2281
statutes
of
general
statewide
application
that
either
of
the
suffolk
county
charter
or
the
specific
statute
relating
to
houston
county,
alabama
fit
within
that
category.
arguments
are
made
to
the
contrary
and
i
assume
will
be
made
by
the
--
for
the
parties
but
we
have
--
we've
raised
this
question
and
as
to
the
other
two
cases
that
we
feel
jurisdiction
is
appropriate,
we
think
that
in
response
to
the
court's
question
in
number
724,
that
the
answer
to
that
question
of
whether
a
three-judge
court
should
have
been
convened
is
no,
it
should
not
have
been
convened
as
the
court
undoubtedly
know
that
it
was
initially
convened
and
then
circuit
judge
bryan
wrote
an
opinion
determining
that
the
matter
was
local
in
nature
and
the
three-judge
court
was
not
required.
we
feel
that
the
procedure
there
was
proper,
the
fourth
circuit
has
jurisdiction
and
the
case
is
properly
here
on
appeal
from
the
fourth
circuit.
now,
in
view
of
the
government
there
can
really
be
but
one
answer
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
reynolds
applied
to
its
local
level?
and
that
is
that
it
does.
it
seems
to
us
that
as
an
initial
matter,
this
simply
close
logically
from
the
basic
constitutional
underpinnings
of
reynolds.
we
don't
just
rely
on
logic.
it
seems
to
us
also
that
sound
policy
considerations
argue
for
this
result
as
well.
you
have
heard
to
some
extent
well
here
i
supposed
some
horrible
arguments
about
how
many
bodies
are
involved.
we
realized
how
many
are
involved
and
we've
attempted
in
our
brief
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
nevertheless
we
feel
that
the
principle
insofar
as
the
question
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
decision-making,
the
matter
is
manageable
by
the
courts.
i'd
like
to
make
clear
our
basic
constitutional
position.
it's
simply
this.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
there's
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
elect
local
bodies.
that's
justice
black
had
pointed
out.
it's
not
the
question
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
no,
we
think
that
the
school
board
case
just
argued
is
properly
here
also.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
the
statute
there
was
one
that
related
to
all
such
bodies
throughout
the
state
and
not
just
to
--
and
as
we
construed
the
--
the
case
is
under
2281,
that's
a
state
statute
filling
up
the
--
our
basic
position
is
this
where
members
of
the
local
governmental
body
are
under
state
or
local
law
elected,
not
appointed
and
where
directly
or
indirectly
they're
elected
from
districts
and
where
the
body
is
one
that
is
intended
to
be
representative
in
nature,
that
in
no
circumstances,
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
that
the
districts
established
and
be
substantially
equal
in
population
or
that
some
alternative
arrangement
that
coincides
with
that
basic
principle
be
established.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
in
the
first
place
is
--
is
i'm
sure
you
realize
you
--
you
don't
reach
those
in
these
cases.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
we
don't
have
any
--
any
basic
disagreement
with
proportional
representation
system
so
long
as
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
no,
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
well,
it
--
it
requires
the
--
it
requires
the
majority
rule
in
the
sense
that
where
there
is
a
districting
scheme,
it
requires
that
those
districts
should
be
set
up
on
a
--
on
equal
population
basis.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
constitutionally
is
to
a
proportional
representation
scheme
which
attempts
to
treat
all
voters
equally
and
yet
ensure
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
the
new
york
city
council
situation
is
somewhat
relevant
to
a
case
called
(inaudible)
versus
wagner,
i
believe,
that
came
up
and
involves
a
scheme
where
the
at
large
to
at
large
members
of
the
city
council
are
required
to
be
from
different
political
parties.
the
court
dismissed
the
appeal
several
years
ago
and
--
and
that
was
initially
tested.
and
subsequently
another
challenge
to
the
scheme
was
upheld.
i
think
those
questions
are
very
difficult
ones.
i
don't
think
the
position
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
i
think
it
depends
on
how
far
you
--
how
far
you
push
--
pushed
the
principle.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
as
the
cases
that
--
that
are
before
the
court,
they
don't
draw
any
of
those
schemes.
and
in
our
view
all
of
them
are
covered
by
principle
that
--
that
we
stated
in
--
in
the
brief
that
we
derived
from
reynolds.
now,
when
an
appropriate
case
comes
along
that
involves
one
of
those
kinds
of
schemes,
i
think
the
question
then
is
going
to
be
whether
the
principles
established
in
reynolds
and
the
equal
protection
clause
principles
generally
are
such
that
--
that
that's
sort
of
scheme
will
be
condoned
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
think
it
depe
--
it
depends
on
the
particular
arrangement
that
you
have
and
how
much
of
a
voice
that
you
give
in.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
well
it
seems
to
me
that
consistent
with
reynolds
it's
rather
difficult
to
make
out
reasons
for
supporting
such
an
approach.
there
are
an
infinite
variety
of
all
these
kinds
of
bodies
and
schemes.
but
reynolds,
of
course,
construed
the
equal
protection
clause
insofar
as
the
individual
voter's
right
is
concerned.
and
it's
the
same
individual
voter
in
the
--
in
the
local
election
in
the
--
as
it
is
in
the
state
law.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
i
think
that's
right
but
i
--
but
--
but
reynolds,
he
asked
about
proportional
representation
schemes.
and
i
don't
think
that
reynolds
speaks
necessarily
proportional
representation
schemes.
illinois
for
instance
has
had
an
arrangement
in
which
you
had
something
like
proportional
representation
scheme.
i
don't
think
that
was
drawn
out
by
the
--
by
the
lower
court
or
by
this
court
in
reviewing
that
case.
in
our
view
where
members
of
these
local
bodies
are
appointed
instead
of
elected
or
whether
they're
elected
at
large
rather
than
from
districts,
we
feel
that
the
equal
protection
--
equal
population
principle
announced
in
reynolds
would
be
inapplicable.
all
of
the
four
bodies
in
our
view
that
are
involved
here
fit
within
the
category
of
those
covered
by
the
principle,
and
we
submit
that
includes
the
city
council
in
number
724
where
at
large
elections
are
held
but
unequally
populated
residence
districts
are
set
up.
and
it
includes
also
the
school
board
in
number
430
despite
the
difficulties
with
the
two-step
election
scheme
that
is
presented
there.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
well
it
wasn't
really
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
as
we
understand,
it
wasn't
an
annexation
--
it
wasn't
an
annexation.
probably
(voice
overlap)
yes,
because,
yes,
because
the
city
of
norfolk
was
proposing
to
move
under
virginia
beach
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh
it's
clear
that
to
some
extent,
the
original
--
the
original
city
council
that
was
set
up
here
was
not
under
the
seven-four
plan.
it
took
the
six
sitting
former
supervisors
and
put
them
on
the
council
and
the
five
city
council
members
of
virginia
beach,
and
put
them
on
the
council.
it's
clear
that
there
--
there
was
a
relationship
between
the
adoption
of
that
scheme
and
an
attempt
to
get
both
of
the
former
bodies
to
go
along
with.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
wouldn't
go
ahead
without
that
because
the
overwriting
concerns
seem
to
be
avoiding
annexation
by
the
city
of
norfolk.
as
an
initial
matter
in
our
view
that
there
can
be
no
serious
questions
that
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
generally
to
action
at
the
local
as
well
as
the
state
level
cooper
and
aaron,
come
in,
in
light
what
it
seemed
to
us
established
that
beyond
doubt.
and
nor
do
we
think
that
it'd
be
seriously
contended
the
court
has
already
decided
this
question.
some
suggestions
have
made
that
several
per
curiam
indicate
the
court
feels
that
the
question
of
local
apportionment
is
one
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
get
involved
in.
we
don't
read
those
cases
that
way
and
noting
of
jurisdiction
in
these
cases
it
seems
to
me
makes
clear
that
that's
not
the
position
the
court
has
taken.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
continue
from
yesterday,
i'd
like
for
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
reynolds
versus
sims.
now
reynolds
and
its
companions
were
of
course
state
legislative
cases
and
the
cases
before
the
court
presently
are
--
involved
local
governmental
bodies.
but
in
our
view,
reynolds
was
grounded
on
the
basic
principle
that
the
citizen's
vote
could
not
be
debased
or
deluded
in
effect
on
the
basis
where
he
resides.
and
that
they
touched
on
a
democratic
government
as
equal
representation
for
equal
numbers
of
people.
now
in
our
view,
those
basic
constitutional
principles
are
just
as
applicable
at
the
local
level
as
they
are
at
the
state
level.
it
seems
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
at
least
prima
facie
every
time
you
have
a
situation
in
which
a
body
is
elected
under
state
law
by
the
people.
and
the
members
of
that
body
are
elected
from
districts.
that
those
districts
should
be
substantially
full
in
population
or
that
an
equivalent
arrangement
which
would
accord
appropriate
weight
to
the
votes
be
established.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
think
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
may
reach
a
point
where
some
concept
of
de
minimis
is
involved
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
judgment
for
the
states
and
the
local
bodies
to
make.
if
they
decide
that
they
want
to
have
the
body
elected,
presumably
it's
supposed
to
represent
the
constituency
that's
electing
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
functions
are
important.
i
think
the
difficulty
has
to
do
with
setting
up
some
workable
criteria.
how
do
you
decide
whether
a
body
is
legislative
or
quasi
legislative?
it
seems
to
me
that
a
rule
that
would
subscribe
only
bodies
exercising
something
like
substantial
or
important
or
basic
governmental
powers
could
be
evolved.
but
the
problem
of
trying
to
apply
that
rule
in
each
individual
case
it
seems
to
me
would
be
a
never
ending
one.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
state
of
a
local
body
decides
that
its
members
are
going
to
be
elected
and
they're
going
to
be
elected
from
districts,
then
they've
made
a
judgment
that
that
body
is
intended
to
be
representative
of
the
electorate.
and
if
they
feel
that
it's
important
enough
to
handle
it
that
way
and
the
people
feel
that
it's
important
enough
to
handle
it
that
way,
then
i'd
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
court
should
go
along
with
that
judgment.
and
now
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
if
they
disagree
and
they
want
to
have
it
appointed
or
they
want
it
elect
at
some
other
way
at
large
or
whatever,
then
that's
open
to
them
under
the
way
that
we
view
these
cases.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
isn't
is
--
i
don't
think
it's
substantial
problems
that
might
first
appear
because
as
we
point
out
the
bodies
that
are
elected
and
are
elected
from
districts
are
generally
those
bodies
that
perform
important
substantial
governmental
functions.
then
as
you
shade
off
into
bodies
that
various
kinds
of
special
districts,
particularly
those
who
would
like
taxing
power,
they're
generally
not
elected
from
districts
anyhow.
very
few
of
them
are.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
body's
functions
are
quite
limited
in
the
sailors
case
and
we
don't
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
so
inflexible,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
before
it
would
apply,
a
judgment
has
to
be
made
at
the
state
or
at
the
local
level
that
this
body
will
be
composed
to
members
elected
or
chosen
in
a
way
that
would
indicate
that
the
intention
is
that
it'd
be
a
body
that
represents
the
people
that
it'd
be
elected.
and
they
don't
have
to
do
it
that
way.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
they
could
set
it
up
anyway
they
want
to.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
when
you
get
to
a
special
function
district
such
as
a
conservancy
or
a
sewerage
or
a
drainage
district,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
isn't
out
of
the
question,
if
a
rational
basis
is
ordered
by
the
state
in
setting
the
thing
up
to
allow
some
deviations
from
a
population
basis.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
until
you
reach
a
position
in
which
you
have
a
rational
basis
established,
and
shown,
and
demonstrated,
then
as
a
prima
facie
matter
that
these
bodies
as
well
as
the
general
function
bodies
should
be
covered
by
the
equal
population
principles
so
long
as
they're
elected
from
districts.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
developed
in
our
brief
in
a
section
directed
towards
special
districts,
several
pages
of
various
distinctions
that
might
be
suggested
or
made.
we
say
in
that
part
of
the
brief
that
in
our
view,
as
a
prima
facie
matter
where
they're
elected
from
districts,
we
feel
that
the
principle
ought
to
apply.
what
i
said
is
that
if
a
state
in
a
given
situation
of
a
special
function
district
can
show
that
it's
set
up
in
a
particular
way
that
it
deviates
to
some
extent
from
population
because
the
impact
of
the
body,
when
it
does,
relates
to
certain
people
living
in
one
part
of
the
area
in
a
different
way
than
it
does
to
those
living
elsewhere,
then
i
think
that
question
is
open.
and
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i'd
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
wouldn't
slide
that
quickly
into
saying
that
they
should
therefore
have
one
representative
from
each
school
district.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
that
if
the
body
has,
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
the
body
has
taxing
power
overall
the
people.
and
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
say
that
they
can
do
this
thing.
the
kind
of
bodies
that
i'm
really
talking
about
are
ones
that
based
--
board
qualifications
on
things
like
property
ownership.
some
of
these
districts,
it
seems
to
me,
that
--
that
may
makes
--
that
they
may
make
some
sense
because
the
impact
of
their
action
is
on
people
that
own
property.
and
their
taxing
power
relates
to
people
that
own
property
and
not
to
the
elected
generally.
but
i
had
--
i
have
great
difficulty
with
the
hypothetical
that
you've
posed
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
a
necessary
conclusion
that
you
represent
each
school
district
just
because
some
of
the
school
districts
may
have
unique
problems.
you
may
ensure
that
some
of
them
that
have
these
unique
problems
have
some
representations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
there
may
be
some
in
limited
situations
of
special
function
bodies.
i
don't
think
any
of
that's
before
the
court
presently
but
obviously,
these
decisions
are
going
to
bear
upon
those
questions
also,
i
suppose.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
pretty
close
to
the
middle.
we
feel
that
unbalanced
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
i
think
it's
a
very
close
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
board
was
appointed.
the
statutory
scheme
there
it
says
that
this
assembly
elects
the
body
in
a
nominating
arrangement
is
such
that
it
follows
an
election
sort
of
pattern.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
squarely,
the
people
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
sir?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
they
select
a
representative
that
meets
with
the
representatives
of
the
other
school
districts
and
selects
the
five
board
members.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
kind
of
board,
sir?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
probably
not
because
i
would
--
i'd
think
that
--
that
as
an
initial
matter,
your
question
whether
that
board
was
intended
to
be
a
representative
of
the
people
on
the
first
place.
and
that's
the
difficult
question
it
seems
to
me
of
the
sailors
case
in
the
elections
scheme
that
exists
there.
they
argue
that
the
county
board
is
supposed
to
be
representative
of
the
school
districts.
and
therefore,
since
there
isn't
any
right
to
vote
conferred
by
state
law,
their
--
the
reynolds
principle
doesn't
apply.
i
think
its
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
they
can't.
i
think
that's
quite
clear,
there
are
enough
persons.
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
danger
in
that
case.
the
danger
lies
in
sanctioning
this
kind
of
two-step
election
arrangement
because
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
if
a
state
decided
to
set
its
state
legislative
apportionment
of
this
way.
suppose
a
state
said
that
each
county
clerk
shall
meet
together
and
pick
the
members
of
a
legislature,
i
would
have
some
difficulty
with
that.
and
i
also
have
some
difficulty
in
distinguishing
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i
don't
know
how
different
it
is.
they
would
be
elected
by
the
people
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
sailors
is
a
close
and
difficult
case.
and
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
if
the
court
is
concerned
about
the
two-step
election
scheme
that
exist
there
that
we
would
submit
that
nevertheless,
most
school
boards
are
directly
elected
by
the
people.
and
that
they
at
least
should
be
covered
by
the
equal
population
principle
where
they're
elected
from
districts.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
where
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
where
the
court
started
but
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
court
went
beyond
that
in
reynolds
and
the
companion
cases
and
determined
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
it's
almost
impossible
to
decide
that.
you
end
up
with
--
you
know,
you
start
backing
of
as
to
what
it
does
and
pretty
soon
you're
--
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
know
what
you
mean,
the
principle
would
apply.
if
he's
elected
statewide,
i
assume
he's
elected
at
large.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
gray
versus
sanders
takes
care
of
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
but
as
a
policy
matter,
i
think
it's
difficult
to
--
even
if
it
didn't
try
to
draw
these
lines
between
what
does
the
local
level's
legislative
and
what
is
not.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
in
a
fairly
stance
of
footnote
that
there
has
been
some
litigation
involving
this
question.
i
don't
think
that
in
a
general,
the
parlance,
judges
are
intended
to
be
representative
even
if
they
are
elected.
i
think
it's
a
difficult
problem.
i
personally
would
come
out
holding
that
the
equal
population
principle
does
not
apply.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
i
would
say
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
say
that
it
would
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
apply,
no,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
as
i
said,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
make
a
judgment
when
you
get
out
on
the
extremes
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
not
that
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
whether
the
body
or
the
board
of
the
office
is
one
that
--
it
is
intended
to
be
a
representative
office.
so
that
there
is
the
relation
between
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
representative
means
that
that
the
state
has
made
a
judgment
that
there
is
a
--
is
the
kind
of
relationship
between
the
voter
and
the
powers
of
the
body
or
the
person.
thus,
that
this
person
acts
in
some
respects
in
the
place
of
the
individual,
the
voter,
and
i
don't
think
we
think
that
judges
do
that.
i
hope
we
don't.
and
that's
the
way
the
third
circuit
came
out
in
one
of
these
cases
but
--
i
don't
know.
i
think
those
are
difficult
questions
and
they're
at
the
extreme
difference.
