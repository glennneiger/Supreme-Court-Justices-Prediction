does
it
make
any
difference
to
you
what
the
actual
result
in
this
case
was
in
terms
of
where
the
five
men
--
men
--
five
men
board
came
from?
was
the
election
held?
justice
byron

white
whether
the
four
of
five
come
from
grand

justice
byron

white
but
where
did
they
come
from
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
michigan
law
provided
for
appointment
of
county
school
boards
by
the
governor?
and
the
governor
made
the
same
appointments
to
the
--
this
particular
county
school
board
that
it
--
that
--
that
the

people
from
the
same
places
and
grand
rapids
would
feel
like
they've
been
left
out
with
only
one
out
of
five
men.
would
they
have
any
complaint
under
reynolds
against
sims?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
court
--
what
if
the
court
disagreed
with
you
on
that
because
the
governor
could
appoint
whoever
he
wanted
to
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned
that
would
that
also
determine
this
case?
justice

five
to
nine.
and
then
one
of
those
five
to
nine
goes
every
two
years
to
a
biannual
meeting
to
elect
five
members
of
the
county
school
board.
justice

as
a

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

exactly,
you're
talking

set
up.
justice

mr.
strawhecker,
let's
assume
that
the
michigan
law
provided
for
the
direct
election
of
this
county
--
county
school
board
by
the
people.
and
that
the
two
parties
or
the
three
parties
or
how
many
have
put
up
candidates
for
all
five
positions
and
they
are
all
elected
every
two
years.
and
they
are
elected
by
districts.
would
--
i
suppose
your
position
is
that
reynolds
against
sims
wouldn't
catch
that
situation
either
because
it's
a
local
governmental
unit.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let's
assume
that
you
are
wrong
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
assume
--
and
assume
that
--
assume
that
reynold
against
sims
would
re
--
would
require
that
those
districts
for
the
election
county
school
board
members
had
to
be
of
equal
sides,
population-wise.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
--
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
then
that
if
reynolds
against
sims
applied
to
my
example
of
the
direct
election
by
districts
of
the
county
school
board,
you
would
say
automatically
then
that
reynolds
against
sims
has
to
apply
to
these
situations
that
you
have
in
this
case
and
that
this
case
has
to
satisfy
reynolds
against
sims?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
what
would
keep
reynolds
against
sims
from
applying
to
this
case
if
it
applies
to
the
direct
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
majority
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
--
in
line
of
mr.
justice
fortas
question
does
the
county
board
have
anything
to
do
with
consolidation?
justice
byron

white
but
the
number
of
scho
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
number
of
school
districts
have
declined
fro
40
or
50
down
to
21,
is
that
by
consolidation?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
people
didn't
elect
this
board,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
each
county
sends
their
representatives
to
the
states
and
the
(inaudible)
equally,

board
that
this
is
the
board
who
adjust
taxes.
just
to
consider
cases
involving
discrepancies
and
discriminations
in
texas
or
whatever
they
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
school
districts
as
such
claimed
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
insist
that
before
reynolds
to
apply,
the
body
must
have
the
legislative
functions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
the
principle
apply
to
election
of
statewide
officials,
let's
say,
treasure
of
the
state
wholly
administrative
offices?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
it
takes
care
of
it
and
because
of

because
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
catch
non-legislative

justice

also?
