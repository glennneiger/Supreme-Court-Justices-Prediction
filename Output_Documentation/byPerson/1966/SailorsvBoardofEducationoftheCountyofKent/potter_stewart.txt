justice
potter
stewart
how
many
school
districts
are
there
in
kent
county,
mr.
miles?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
each
one
of
those
school
districts
have
the
same
number
of
members
on
its
local
district
school
board?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
large
by
the
dis
--
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
people
in
the
district.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
people
in
the
district.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
how
many
members
are
there?
would
it
range
from
about
three
to
around
nine
or
what
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
that
one
selected?
how
is
that
one
representative
of
each
school
district
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
it
elects
one
of
its
members
to
go
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
then
the
election
of
the
five
members
of
the
county
school
board
i
realized
there's
staggard
terms
of
which
i
think
i
had
just
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
two
at
a
time.
justice
potter
stewart
but
tho
--
that
membership
is
elected
by
the
deputies
at
this
biannual
meeting
from
among
their
members,
from
among
themselves
they
elect?
justice
potter
stewart
to
election
as
a
member
of
the
county
school
board.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
can
be
a
stranger,
he
can
be
a
nonmember
of
any
district
school
board,
can't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
--
but
he
usually
is
a
member
of
one
of
the
district
school
board,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
anyone
from
nelson
center,
you've
been
telling
us
a
lot
about
nelson
center.
justice
potter
stewart
the
county
school
board
has
the
power
to
impose
taxes?
justice
potter
stewart
up
to
a
certain
limitation
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
has
the
power
to
make
policy
decisions
with
respect
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
these
special
schools
and
the
truck
system
and
various
others
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
--
what
power
as
to
the
local
school,
the
21
school
districts
have?
what
powers
do
they
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
within
the
school
districts?
justice
potter
stewart
to
any
power
they
must
have,
i
suppose
they
have
some
policymaking
functions
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
have
any
taxing
power
within
the
distrcit?
justice
potter
stewart
within
their
district?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
county
board.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
school
district,
the
grand
rapids
school
district
as
you
told
me,
as
i
understand
it,
itself
has
power
to
impose
taxes
within
its
district,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
has
power
to
make
policy
within
its
district.
justice
potter
stewart
then
can
a
county
school
board
reverse
or
veto
any
of
those
decisions
by
the
district?
justice
potter
stewart
supplemental
and
they
can't
--
they
can't
take
away
anything
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
overrule
anything
that
the
grand
rapids
district
has
decided
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
need
to
take
any
such
broad
position.
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
ta
--
take
by
representing
the
kent
board
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
--
as
i
understand
it,
all
11
are
elected
by
the
entire
electorate
of
the
new
and
large
city
of
virginia
beach.
justice
potter
stewart
at
large
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
within
the
old
city.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
the
borders
of
the
new
city
elect
wholly
at
large.
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
you
do
it
then?
some
or
all
of
the
various
proposals
of
taking
back
in
the
early
years
of
this
century
by
--
to
improve
the
--
to
improve
the
more
simplistic
former
electoral
process
such
proposal
is
the
hair
system
of
proportional
representation
or
the
list
system
or
some
variant
evidence
found
in
the
-
by
weimar
republic
or
the
third
republic
in
france.
are
those
all
out
or
are
they
in
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
they
--
but
these
--
these
systems
are
utilized
in
some
communities
in
our
country
have
been
certainly.
justice
potter
stewart
but
certainly
entirely
contrary
to
what
you
said
the
constitution
seems
to
say
the
constitution
requires
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
--
the
hair
system
of
proportional
representation
is
suppose
to
guarantee
minority
representation.
and
reynolds
against
sims
requires
a
majority
move.
justice
potter
stewart
guarantee
representatives
of
identifiable
or
people
who
choose
to
coalesce
ideologically
rather
than
geographically
within
a
--
in
a
constituency.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reasoning
of
your
--
they
aren't
difficult.
they're
difficult
for
me
as
one
reason
i
ask
you
but
it
seems
to
me
the
reasoning
of
your
brief
would
just
make
impossible
any
such
supposedly
a
progressive
and
lightened
experimentation
along
those
lines.
such
systems
as
would
guarantee
for
example
a
party,
a
minority
party
representation
in
the
city
council
or
a
school
board
by
providing
that
not
more
than
six
out
of
nine
should
be
from
a
certain
political
party.
all
those
are
completely
made
unconstitutional
under
the
argument
that
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
why
you've
pushed
it
all
away
and
you
pushed
all
those
things
off
the
board.i
wondered
if
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
that
--
doesn't
it
--
depends
upon
the
--
among
the
infinite
variety
of
arrangements
that
--
that
undoubtedly
exist
in
the
county,
certainly
the
thousands
of
various
local
governmental
units
in
the
50
states
of
this
nation.
doesn't
it
depend?
doesn't
the
equal
protection
answer
depend
upon
the
particular
ratio
that
--
that
you
have.
isn't
it
too
justice
fortas
suggested
earlier,
how
is
it
selected,
elected,
or
appointed?what
powers
does
it
have?
is
there
--
is
it
proper
actually
to
say
no
matter
what
the
arrangement,
no
matter
what
the
history,
no
matter
what
the
function,
no
matter
how
presently
selected
or
what
the
purposes
are
in
the
present
selection,
whether
they
guarantee
minority
representation,
or
what,
these
all
go
out,
these
all
have
to
come
under
this
mathematical
formula.
the
equal
protection
clause
permits,
allows,
no
variation
from
this
mathematical
scheme.
that's
what
currently
bothered
me
about
your
--
about
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
that
these
laws
of
the
states
very
briefly
with
respect
to
how
a
city
in
the
next
territory,
the
one
i'm
familiar
with
is
one
in
which
the
resident
freeholders
and
the
territory
proposed
to
be
annexed,
have
to
vote
in
favor
of
annexation
which
makes
annexation
of
course
extremely
difficult.
and
i
suppose
this
virginia
beach
situation
probably
would
reflect
some
current
in
other
words
to
--
to
persuade
the
people
to
be
annexed
--
to
be
annexed
to
the
municipality
where
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
sure
that
they
would
be
--
they
--
their
voices
will
be
heard
in
the
--
in
the
city
government?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
thinking
--
or
of
course,
city
is
surrounded
by
as
many
in
ohio
are
you
know,
by
--
by
satellite
municipalities
in
order
to
get
those
municipalities,
those
people
with
their
tax
base
and
with
their
leadership,
and
so
on
to
join
the
city,
you
have
to.
they
don't
want
to
be
swallowed
up.
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
i
gather
that
my
brother
fortas
is
suggesting,
my
questions
is
this
that
in
reynolds
against
sims,
to
which
you're
now
directing
your
attention,
it
was
clear
that
what
was
there
involved
were
representative,
legislative
bodies.
but
we're
now
embarking
under
the
unchartered
area,
many
--
an
intimate
drive
different
local
units
with
various
purposes.
and
take
for
example
a
conservancy
district
with
the
precise
and
limited
powers
in
a
certain
county
let
us
say,
where
it
may
be
of
utmost
importance
that
each
unit
in
our
county
be
represented
on
the
conservative
--
conservancy
district
in
order
for
us
to
--
in
order
for
it
to
be
able
to
perform
its
precise
function
of
allocating
the
war
or
the
--
whatever
natural
resource
its
concerned
with.
with
--
in
other
words,
quite
a
different
purpose
from
an
ordinary
state
legislature
with
broad
and
generalized
legislative
power.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
suggesting
that
the
same
reynolds
against
sims
rule
should
inflexibly
apply
all
the
way
down
the
line
regardless
of
purpose,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
question
to
that,
let's
say
that
the
--
it's
decided
that
the
best
kind
of
representation
on
this
imaginary
conservancy
district
of
mine
is
to
have
one
representative
from
each
geographical
unit
affected
by
--
for
the
distribution
of
this
resource,
water,
regardless
of
how
many
people
reside
in
each
geographical
district.
now,
if
that's
the
policy
decision
made,
that's
what's
made.
but
you're
telling
us,
i
gather,
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
school
districts
are
there
in
kent
county,
mr.
miles?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
each
one
of
those
school
districts
have
the
same
number
of
members
on
its
local
district
school
board?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
large
by
the
dis
--
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
people
in
the
district.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
people
in
the
district.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
how
many
members
are
there?
would
it
range
from
about
three
to
around
nine
or
what
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
that
one
selected?
how
is
that
one
representative
of
each
school
district
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
it
elects
one
of
its
members
to
go
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
then
the
election
of
the
five
members
of
the
county
school
board
i
realized
there's
staggard
terms
of
which
i
think
i
had
just
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
two
at
a
time.
justice
potter
stewart
but
tho
--
that
membership
is
elected
by
the
deputies
at
this
biannual
meeting
from
among
their
members,
from
among
themselves
they
elect?
justice
potter
stewart
to
election
as
a
member
of
the
county
school
board.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
can
be
a
stranger,
he
can
be
a
nonmember
of
any
district
school
board,
can't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
--
but
he
usually
is
a
member
of
one
of
the
district
school
board,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
anyone
from
nelson
center,
you've
been
telling
us
a
lot
about
nelson
center.
justice
potter
stewart
the
county
school
board
has
the
power
to
impose
taxes?
justice
potter
stewart
up
to
a
certain
limitation
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
has
the
power
to
make
policy
decisions
with
respect
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
these
special
schools
and
the
truck
system
and
various
others
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
--
what
power
as
to
the
local
school,
the
21
school
districts
have?
what
powers
do
they
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
within
the
school
districts?
justice
potter
stewart
to
any
power
they
must
have,
i
suppose
they
have
some
policymaking
functions
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
have
any
taxing
power
within
the
distrcit?
justice
potter
stewart
within
their
district?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
county
board.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
school
district,
the
grand
rapids
school
district
as
you
told
me,
as
i
understand
it,
itself
has
power
to
impose
taxes
within
its
district,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
has
power
to
make
policy
within
its
district.
justice
potter
stewart
then
can
a
county
school
board
reverse
or
veto
any
of
those
decisions
by
the
district?
justice
potter
stewart
supplemental
and
they
can't
--
they
can't
take
away
anything
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
overrule
anything
that
the
grand
rapids
district
has
decided
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
need
to
take
any
such
broad
position.
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
ta

take
by
representing
the
kent
board
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
--
as
i
understand
it,
all

are

how

in
favor
of
annexation
which
makes
annexation
of
course
extremely
difficult.
and
i
suppose
this
virginia
beach
situation
probably
would
reflect
some
current
in
other
words
to
--
to
persuade
the
people
to
be
annexed
--
to
be
annexed
to
the
municipality
where
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
sure
that
they
would
be
--
they
--
their
voices
will
be
heard
in
the
--
in
the
city
government?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
thinking
--
or
of
course,
city
is
surrounded
by
as
many
in
ohio
are
you
know,
by
--
by
satellite
municipalities
in
order
to
get
those
municipalities,
those
people
with
their
tax
base
and
with
their
leadership,
and
so
on
to
join
the
city,
you
have
to.
they
don't
want
to
be
swallowed
up.
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
i
gather
that
my
brother
fortas
is
suggesting,
my
questions
is
this
that
in
reynolds
against
sims,
to
which
you're
now
directing
your
attention,
it
was
clear
that
what
was
there
involved
were
representative,
legislative
bodies.
but
we're
now
embarking
under
the
unchartered
area,
many
--
an
intimate
drive
different
local
units
with
various
purposes.
and
take
for
example
a
conservancy
district
with
the
precise
and
limited
powers
in
a
certain
county
let
us
say,
where
it
may
be
of
utmost
importance
that
each
unit
in
our
county
be
represented
on
the
conservative
--
conservancy
district
in
order
for
us
to
--
in
order
for
it
to
be
able
to
perform
its
precise
function
of
allocating
the
war
or
the
--
whatever
natural
resource
its
concerned
with.
with
--
in
other
words,
quite
a
different
purpose
from
an
ordinary
state
legislature
with
broad
and
generalized
legislative
power.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
suggesting
that
the
same
reynolds
against
sims
rule
should
inflexibly
apply
all
the
way
down
the
line
regardless
of
purpose,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
question
to
that,
let's
say
that
the
--
it's
decided
that
the
best
kind
of
representation
on
this
imaginary
conservancy
district
of
mine
is
to
have
one
representative
from
each
geographical
unit
affected
by
--
for
the
distribution
of
this
resource,
water,
regardless
of
how
many
people
reside
in
each
geographical
district.
now,
if
that's
the
policy
decision
made,
that's
what's
made.
but
you're
telling
us,
i
gather,
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
