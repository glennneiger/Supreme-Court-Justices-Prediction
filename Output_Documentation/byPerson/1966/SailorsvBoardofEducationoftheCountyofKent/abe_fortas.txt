justice
abe
fortas
would
you
mind
if
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
--
you're
getting
around
in
response
to
chief
justice's
question.
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
maybe
two
lines
of
inquiry
here.one
is,
how
was
this
board
selected
and
the
other
is
its
powers.
now,
this
board
has
selected
as
i
understand
it
by
a
vote
of
the
members
of
the
--
of
representatives
of
the
39
separate
district
boards
of
education
--
21.
justice
abe
fortas
alright
21,
and
they
get
together
and
they
--
they
elect
this
five-man
board.
is
it
five-man?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that's
good
enough.
now,
second
on
the
question
of
the,
what
this
board
does,
what
kind
of
governmental
function
does
it
exercise?
as
i
undertand
it
now,
it
has
not
--
it
does
not
generally
--
have
general
jurisdiction
over
the
education
in
the
county.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
it
has
jurisdiction
first
with
respect
to
certain
specialized
facilites
for
retarded
children
or
whatver
it
is
etcetera.
and
then
or
is
it
the
fact
that
its
taxing
power
and
bonding
power
are
limited
to
the
raising
of
funds
for
those
purposes?
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
the
agency
charged
if
i
correctly
understand
this
with
raising
money
by
taxes
or
by
the
issuance
of
bonds
for
the
general
schools.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
additon
to
those
specialized
functions,
i
take
it
that
the
reading
of
these
briefs
that
its
powers
are
auxiliary
and
in
aid
of
the
educational
functions
of
the
district
boards
of
education,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
one
further
question.
i
take
it
that
this
specific
controversy
arose
out
of
still
another
power
of
this
county
board.
and
that
has
the
power
to
transfer
geographical
areas
from
one
school
district
to
another,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
are
there
any
other
significant
powers
that
i
have
not
stated?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
evaluate
the
purposes
of
a
decision
one
of
these
issues?
would
you
evaluate
the
functions
performed
by
the
body?
and
if
so,
what
criteria
would
you
take
into
account
or
would
you
apply
this
for
all
the
elected
bodies
regardless
of
what
they
do?
for
example,
if
they're
purely
advisory,
number
one.
number
two,
suppose
that
they're
purely
administrative
as
distinguished
from
exercising
legislative
or
quasi
legislative
powers.
and
number
3,
suppose
a
--
you
exercise
legislative
or
quasi
legislative
powers.
you're
not
suggesting
those
three
are
the
right
categories
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i
am
asking
you
whether
you
have
described
any
importance
to
the
function
of
the
body?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
understand
that
but
i
was
wondering
whether
you
had
given
consideration
to
the
functional
problem
and
what's
your
observation
would
be
difficult
as
it
may
be
to
apply
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at,
the
position
of
the
united
states
then
as
represented
by
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
that
the
function
performed
by
the
body
is
an
irrelevance.
is
that
so?
i
don't
want
to
question
you
whether
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
sailors
case
for
example
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
presents
a
body
with
certainly
with
mixed
functions
does
have
within
some
restricted
perimeter,
taxing
power
and
bonding
power
but
its
functions
to
include
some
advisory
functions.
i
don't
know
how
one
evaluates
those
or
ways
on
one
against
the
other
on
which
is
more
important
but
it
is
a
mixed
body.
justice
abe
fortas
one
of
the
--
it's
a
very
important
question
on
which
i
hope
would
have
the
help
of
the
united
states.
and
you're
now
saying
that
if
it's
a
special
purpose
district,
as
i
understand
you
or
a
special
purpose
body
elected
under
state
law,
then
this
court
ought
to
take
a
look
at
whether
the
method
provided
for
selecting
the
members
of
that
body
has
a
rational
basis
which
is
a
substantial
modification
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
before.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
wouldn't
that
apply
to
a
situation
let's
say
like
sailor?
well,
let's
suppose
that
--
let's
bury
the
facts
a
little
bit.
and
let's
suppose
that
the
county
school
board,
i
suppose
is
a
very
large
county
geographically.
and
that
some
of
the
school
districts,
which
are
small
in
terms
of
population
were
in
remote
parts
of
the
county.
and
the
state
says
that
because
of
the
difference
in
the
problems
of
the
school
district
located
in
the
urban
centers
in
these
remote
school
districts,
we
think
we
ought
to
have
one
representative
from
each
district
on
the
county
school
board.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
we
should
or
we
should
not
take
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
into
account?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
telling
what
the
state
--
supposing
that
that's
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
state
says,
should
we
then
evaluate
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
justification
just
as
you
say
we
should
in
the
case
of
special
purpose
districts?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
want
to
press
anymore
on
this
line
but
i
want
to
suggest
to
you
that
there's
a
difference
between
whether
the
reason
is
valid
and
whether
the
reason
is
legally
relevant.
and
you
started
of
with
an
absolute
proposition
with
respect
to
something
like
the
school
district
which
should
make
reasons
of
a
state
may
have
for
deviating
from
a
one
man,
one
vote
formula,
make
those
reasons
irrelevant.
and
then
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
the
reasons
are
good,
bad,
or
indifferent
that
a
state
had.
and
if
the
real
question
now
--
i'm
putting
to
use;
whether
there
is
any
such
thing
in
your
judgment,
your
submission
to
us
as
a
constitutionally
acceptable
reason
for
a
state
deviation
from
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule.
