mr.
richard
a.
michael
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
can
be
basically
summarized
into
two
broad
categories,
one,
the
lack
of
access
to
certain
information,
and
secondly,
the
validity
of
the
admission
of
his
confession
at
the
trial.
concerning
first,
the
issue
of
the
defense's
access
to
information
perhaps
their
most
significant
issue
is
that
of
the
finding
of
the
hair.
now,
with
respect
to
this
issue,
it
is
important
to
first
determine
what
was
revealed
and
what
was
not
revealed.
at
the
district
court,
when
the
petitioner
testified,
he
testified
that
when
in
those
same
proceedings
he
had
heard
the
state's
attorney
testify
as
to
the
result
of
this
examination.
this
was
the
first
he
had
ever
heard
about
that
hair.
however,
this
conclusion
is
cast
into
doubt
by
his
testimony
at
the
trial
itself.
now,
i'm
talking
about
the
chambers
testimony
that
he
gave
when
the
question
of
his
--
the
admissibility
of
his
confession
first
arose
for
the
determination
by
the
court
before
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
at
that
time,
he
testified
that
in
effect
he
testified,
“they
took
some
pubic
hairs
from
me.
they
told
me
that
another
hair
that
it
matched
with.
i
demand
to
look
in
the
comparative
microscope.
i
looked,
and
i
said
those
hairs
don't
match.
i'm
just
using
the
exact
language
with
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
this
was
the
petitioner,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
defendant
at
the
trial,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
--
he
testified
to
it,
your
honor.
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
un-contradicted
testimony
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
that
that
is
a
fair
statement
on
the
basis
of
this
record
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'll
give
you
the
exact
language,
your
honor.
try
volume
4,
the
court
will
refer
to
this
as
the
brown
record,
volume
4,
page
91
in
273
and
95.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
first
we'll
start,
your
honor
with
page
90.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
at
that
point,
he
testified,
about
the
middle
of
the
second
paragraph
on
page
--
first
full
paragraph
on
page
90.
also,
they
took
a
small
quantity
of
hair
from
around
my
privates.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
this
was
on
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
at
page
95
then
your
honors,
i
refer
you
next
to
that,
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
95.
he
says,
“i
was
in
this
little
room
at
all
times
in
the
evening
of
november
30,
except
for
one
time
when
i
demanded
to
look
through
the
microscope
my
own
self,
because
they
said
these
hairs
belong
to
me.
mr.
lich
made
a
statement
to
me
that
certain
hairs
belonged
to
me.
he
showed
me
some
hairs
there.
i
demanded
to
go
back
and
he
took
me
there
back
into
the
laboratory
and
a
small
room
which
appeared
to
be
a
microscope
room.
and
i
looked
down
and
i
said
them
hairs
don't
match.
i
said
them
hairs
don't
belong
to
me.
and
the
chemist
just
looked
at
me
and
smiled.”
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'm
not
positive
whether
this
--
yes
on
november
30,
he
was
arrested
on
the
28,
i
believe,
this
was
the
30th.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
confession
is
the
30th,
your
honor,
the
same
day
in
which
he
was
confronted
with
these
hairs.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
thought
i
did,
your
honor,
i
was
looking
for
it
and
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
273,
well
that's
just
a
repetition
of
the
first
statement,
your
honor.
this
is
at
his
testimony,
this
narrows
his
testimony,
i
believe,
before
the
jury.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
this
is
his
testimony
before
the
jury
at
273.
all
he
testified
here
your
honor
is
he
said,
“then
they
took
a
bunch
of
hairs
from
around
my
privates.”
mr.
richard
a.
michael
apparently
so,
your
honor.
i'm
trying
to
--
yes,
this
was
before
the
jury.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
testified
only,
your
honor,
that
they
took
some
hair
from
him.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
no
your
honor,
not
as
he
did
before
the
--
and
before
the
court
in
private
when
he
testified
that
they
had
showed
him
this
hair.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
before
the
jury,
no
your
honor,
or
before
in
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
before
the
jury,
it
was
sworn
testimony.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
was
cross-examined,
but
i
don't
believe
about
that
--
the
point
that
we're
talking
about,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
record,
yes
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
all
i
can
do
is
make
an
inference
from
the
record,
your
honor.
my
inference
from
the
record
is
that
they
did
have
this
report
showing
that
it
was
not
his
hair,
and
therefore
never
raised
that
issue
at
trial.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
no
i
beg
to
differ
with
you
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
fact
is
that
this
interrogation
as
we
said
came
back
the
30th.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
was
taken
place
in
november
30th.
they
did
not
get
the
report,
the
scientific
report
as
to
the
result
of
the
comparison
of
these
hairs
until
december
15,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
perhaps
the
person
who
looked
in
the
comparison
microscope
thought
they
did,
but
the
record
is
--
has
no
information
to
guide
us
along
those
lines
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well,
i
think
that
that
is
an
inference
that
the
prosecution
made
at
the
--
made
and
i
think
that
i
would've
done
this
if
i
were
to
try
to
contradict
that
it
as
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
certainly,
it
was
found
on
a
kleenex
that
it
had
been
used
to
take
a
vaginal
smear.
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
fair
to
make
the
assumption
that
that
came
from
the
vagina
of
the
girl.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
i
do
not
your
honor.
the
report
of
the
chemist
merely
identified
that
was
hair
of
human
origin.
that
is
as
far
as
we
know.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
followed
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
would
you
repeat
it
again,
please?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
they
should
have
revealed
it.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well,
of
course
we
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
think
as
the
prosecution,
your
honor,
that
certainly
if
i
had
this
sort
of
information
that
i
would
not
introduce
into
my
case
in
chief,
no.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
oh,
if
were
defending,
yes
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
we
are
of
course,
your
honor,
dealing
in
a
realm
of
supposition
here.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
submit
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
when
we
had
before
the
jury,
his
own
confession,
a
admission
that
he
made
to
betty
baldwin,
and
we
have
the
profession
of
prior
admission
of
guilt,
the
fact
of
a
hair
in
the
vagina
which
did
not
match
his,
i
submit
to
you,
would
not
have
changed
the
result
before
that
jury.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
make
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
make
the
representation
your
honor
that
the
record
shows
that
it
was
a
hair
of
human
origin.
that
it
does
not
show
that
it
was
pubic
hair.
it
does
not
show
that
it
was
not
a
pubic
hair.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
do
contend
that
it
was
not
shown
to
be
a
pubic
hair,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
honor,
i
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
the
duty
to
disclose
is
not
present
for
three
reasons.
first,
i
submit
that
in
effect,
we
can
look
at
it
that
there
was
really
no
nondisclosure
at
all.
he
was
told,
according
to
the
petitioner's
testimony
that
a
hair
was
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim
that
it
matched
his
--
i
beg
your
pardon
that
his
were
taken
for
comparison
purposes
and
a
comparison
was
going
to
be
made.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
there
was
a
denial
by
the
petitioner,
your
honor.
he
was
allowed
to
look
into
the
microscope
and
said
those
hairs
don't
match.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
does
it
say
they
didn't?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
believe
there
is
some
burden
here
your
honor
upon
the
prosecution
--
upon
the
defense.
this
statement
was
made
in
the
--
the
statement
was
made,
the
question
could've
been
asked
by
the
defense.
the
defense
could've
made
a
motion
for
--
the
defense
knew
your
honor
that
there
was
a
hair
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim.
they
knew
that
his
were
being
taken
for
comparison
purposes.
they
never
--
they
had
enough
information
your
honor
in
closing
argument
and
nothing
else
had
been
done
to
make
--
to
argue
in
closing
argument
to
say,
“ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
the
state
knew
that
there
was
hair
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim.”
the
state
took,
mere
comparison
with
the
defendant's
and
they
never
introduced
that
at
trial,
except
the
information
was
totally
in
the
hands
of
the
defense,
the
inference
can
be
drawn
that
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor,
the
prosecution.
the
inference
can
be
drawn
that
that
hair
was
--
that
that
evidence
was
unfavorable.
they
had
that
amount
of
information
in
their
possession,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
honor,
we
of
course
start
with
the
--
with
your
proposition
with
brady
versus
maryland
holds
that
evidence
favorable
to
an
accused
relevant
material
to
the
evidence
of
either
guilt
or
punishment
in
the
hands
of
the
--
on
request,
must
be
revealed.
we
start
with
that
as
our
basic
proposition.
so
then
we
ask
on
applying
that
proposition
to
the
facts
of
the
--
if
i
may,
to
the
facts
of
this
case
first.
we
submit
that
first
there
was
really
no
nondisclosure.
we
submit
that
he
knew
the
hair
was
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim.
we
knew
that
his
were
being
taken
for
comparison
purposes.
we
know
that
he
stated
on
the
record
that
those
hairs
did
not
match
him
that
that
was
never
denied.
as
thus
interpreted,
he
knew
the
hair
was
found.
he
knew
what
comparison
was
made.
he
knew
that
they
didn't
matched,
if
we
can
put
any
credence
in
his
own
ability
to
compare,
and
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
hair
examination
to
know
that
if
a
layman
looks
in
that
he
can
see
whether
it's
obvious
that
hairs
match
or
do
not
match.
but
nevertheless,
he
admittedly
denied
it,
immediately
upon
looking
on
it,
immediately
denied
it
and
that
denial
was
never
denied.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
a
proper
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
assume,
your
honor
that
if
one,
you
can
see
the
materiality
of
this
testimony.
now,
i
must
add
in
answering
this
question
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
based
their
decision
on
this
point
upon,
the
question
of
materiality
of
the
evidence.
the
district
court
stated
the
hair
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim
was
of
not
consequence
and
did
not
prejudice
the
petitioner's
case.
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
that
hair
was
in
the
vagina
was
of
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime,
and
they
further
held
that
on
the
basis
of
the
damaged
condition
of
the
body,
it
could've
been
deposited
by
anybody
who
had
examined
the
body
or
anybody
who
had
handled
the
body
since
the
crime.
that
was
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
so,
but
if
we
assume
the
materiality
of
the
evidence,
if
we
assume
a
proper
request
was
made
as
envisioned
by
brady
versus
maryland,
i
then
ask
you
that
that
information
would
have
to
be
divulged,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
amongst
the
exhibits
now.
maybe
you
know
that
it
is
not
presently
amongst
the
exhibit.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
it
is
in
existence,
i
do
not
know
where
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
he
did
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
there
was
no
doctor's
report
on
that,
your
honor.
there
was
a
chemist
report.
the
chemist
did
not
--
only
reported
that
it
was
hair
of
human
origin,
probably
of
human
origin.
he
uses
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
was
or
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
was
not,
but
i
just
am
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
beg
your
pardon,
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor,
i
consider
that
that's
significant.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
don't
think
that
they
have
shown
either
the
materiality
or
the
reasonableness,
your
honor.
now,
one
thing
that
is
to
be
noted
with
respect
to
that
motion
is
that
they
ask
for
the
evidence
that
the
state
is
going
to
introduce.
the
hair
wasn't
even
introduced
as
very
technically
interpreted.
the
motion
does
not
even
apply
to
the
hair.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
testimony,
your
honors,
states
that
amongst
the
physical
evidence
seen
was
hair
and
hairs.
it
does
not
define
determining
further,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
testimony
does
not
state
how
it
was,
your
honor.
all
it
states
is
that
“what
evidence
did
you
see
when
you
examined
it?”
“i
saw
hairs.”
he
stated
it,
he
didn't
state
whether
it
was
in
vial
or
how
it
was.
i
assumed
it
was
in
the
vial
because
that
at
least
was
the
way
it
went
to
the
chemist.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
first
they
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
i
read
the
record
your
honor,
first
they
were
allowed
to
view
the
evidence
personally.
then
they
made
the
motion
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
made
the
motion
to
view
the
evidence
as
i
read
it
prior
to
the
motion
to
make
the
scientific
examination
of
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
am
not
aware,
your
honor,
whether
it
was
just
granted
by
the
prosecution
or
whether
there
was
a
court
order
on
that.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
court
does
not.
the
--
in
the
court
the
state's
attorney
was
asked
why
he
opposed
that
motion,
and
he
testified
your
honor
that
he
opposed
it
because
they
--
he
could
not
be
assured.
he
was
not
assured
that
the
evidence
would
not
be
--
the
chain
of
evidence
would
not
be
some
way
destroyed
by
the
tests
that
were
going
to
be
taken.
that
is
why
he
opposed
it,
the
reason
--
the
ruling
of
the
judge,
however,
is
not
in
the
record.
the
reason
or
the
ruling
of
the
judge
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
we
turn
then
your
honors
to
the
question
of
the
bloody
shorts.
now,
the
chemist
for
the
state
literally
testified
at
the
trial
--
testified
at
the
trial
that
the
shorts
did
contain
blood.
and
the
state's
attorney
also
testified
--
stated
in
argument
referred
to
these
shorts
as
bloody
shorts.
now,
at
the
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
do
not
think
the
record
indicated
that
he
pointed
to
any
spot,
your
honor.
it
said
this
is
blood.
he
referred
to
the
document
in
general
as
the
bloody
shorts.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
statement
was
made
to
the
jury
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know
that
there
was
any
paint
on
these.
there
was
then
therefore,
the
jury
would,
i
assume
allow
to
draw
the
inference
that
all
the
spots
were
those
of
blood.
on
the
other
hand,
i
do
not
think
any
direct
statement
was
made
any
given
spot
or
all
spots
were
blood.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
in
the
district
court
they
did
make
a
scientific
examination
of
all
the
evidence.
one
martin,
a
chemist
employed
by
the
petitioner
here,
took
12
strands
at
out
of
the
more
heavily
stained
areas
of
that
garment,
12
fibers.
he
examined
those
12
fibers,
each
out
of
one
of
the
heavily
stained
areas.
his
testimony
was
that
ten
of
the
fibers
contained
paint.
one
of
the
fibers
are
kind
of
a
carbon
substance
and
one
of
the
fibers
an
unidentified
substance.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
is
correct,
the
only
motion
from
the
scientific
examination
was
the
one
that
we
have
referred
to
with
respect
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
generally
speaking,
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
granted,
your
honor.
the
general
rule
under
illinois
law
is
that,
it
was
enunciated
by
the
court
by
the
way
in
reviewing
this
case,
is
that
there
is
a
qualified
--
red-light
lining
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
allow
the
defense
to
make
scientific
evidence
of
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
there
were
no
further
basis
than
that
your
honor,
i
submit
that
yes
it
would
be.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
could
be
reviewed
however
for
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
if
there
were
no
reason
at
all
for
denying
a
motion
to
make
scientific
evidence,
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
in
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
to
the
extent
that
brady
versus
maryland
so
enunciates
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
report
of
the
state's
expert
on
that
your
honor
was
that
he
had
examined
it,
he
had
found
paint
and
he
made
no
--
i
take
it
back,
he
had
found
blood
and
he
made
no
test
for
any
other
substance.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
chemist
did
not,
your
honor.
the
state's
attorney
in
the
district
court
did
testify
that
he
knew
that
all
of
the
stains
on
it
were
not
blood.
that
is
all
we
have
in
the
record
on
that
issue.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
so
testified
in
the
district
court,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
certainly
referred
to
the
bloody
shots.
of
course,
the
report
of
the
short
hand
report,
it
would
not
indicate
whether
he
was
waiving
it
or
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard

yes,
your

“let
me
ask
you
this
mr.

as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.

didn't
you
know
at
the
time
of
the

that
these
spots
in

examination
were
not

“oh!
i
knew
that
all
of
them
were
not
blood,
yes
sir.”
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
i
was.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
was
a
chemist,
your

employed
by
the
state
bureau
of

i
don't
really
--
criminal
--
the
scientific
arm
of
the
state
government
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
testified
there
your
honor
that
he
knew
that
some
of
those
spots
were
paint,
i
would
assume.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
right,
your
honor.
he
testified
only
that
he
had
examined
for
blood
and
he
had
made
no
other
tests
on
the
garment.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
i
would
assume
that
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
written
report
from
litterly
is
in
the
record,
and
at
my
recollection
of
it,
it
is
in
the
echo
--
the
report
of
the
exhibits.
the
report
of
litterly
is
found
at

no

think

looking

trying

do
you

yes,

better.

found
to
be

further
serological
examination

the

of

it
was
probably
of

numerous
hairs

fibers
were

do
not
know,
your
honor.
all
i
know
is
that
in
the
district
court
he
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes.
he
testified
that
he
--
he
did
not
testify
that
some
of
the
stains
were
not.
he
testified
that
he
knew
that
some
of
the
stains
were
not
blood.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
litterly's
testimony
at
the
trial
you're
referring
to
now,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
your
honor.
litterly's
testimony
at
the
trial
appears
in
the
brown
colored
volume
4
at
page
168.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
stated,
“i
examined
and
tested
people's
exhibit
3
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
staining
material
thereon.
that
result
of
the
first
test
was
that
this
material
upon
the
shorts
is
blood.
i
made
a
second
examination
it's
as
close
as
the
blood
of
human
origin
and
made
a
further
examination
which
disclosed
that
the
blood
was
of
group
a.”
that
was
his
testimony
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'm
not
sure
that
he
ever
did.
it
was
the
state's
attorney
who
conceded
that
he
knew
that
some
of
the
stains
were
not
blood,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
we
submit
that
on
this
issue,
your
honors,
the
critical
point
is
whether
there
was
blood
on
these
shorts.
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
there
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
there
is
blood
on
these
shorts,
your
honor,
and
the
mere
testimony
by
the
prosecution
only
is
that
there
are
--
is
blood
in
these
shorts.
and
if
they
do
refer
to
them
as
bloody
shorts,
if
there
is
blood
on
them,
i
submit
that
even
though
there's
also
paint,
there
is
no
going
beyond
the
truth,
if
you
will,
as
indicated
by
napue.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
however,
the
chemist
for
the
prosecution
did
testify
that
he
had
no
opinion
today
as
to
whether
there
was
any
blood
on
it
or
not.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
except
for
one
stain,
your
honor
that
is
unidentifiable
in
origin.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
think
not
only
under
illinois
but
under
the
decision
of
this
court
it
would
have
been,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
sir.
however,
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
the
point
i
was
making
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
the
petitioner
did
testify
in
his
confession,
admitted
in
his
confession
that
these
were
his
shorts.
the
critical
issue
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
it
is
in
the
record,
your
honor
on
before
--
it
appears
really
in
two
places.
one,
mr.
christensen
who
took
the
confession,
testified
as
to
what
he
said
to
him
during
the
interrogation
and
then
another
time
that
mr.
baudino
read
his
confession
into
the
record.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
mr.
christensen's
statement
begins
on
128,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
this
would
be
the
trial
transcript,
your
honor,
the
brown
covered
by
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
volume
4.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
no.
then
you
have
the
--
we
are
looking
now,
your
honor,
for
the
--
where
the
confession.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
there's
nothing
at
all,
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
would
you
excuse
me?
the
confession
your
honor
of
the
defendant
was
right
under
the
record
of
page
144.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
he
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
testimony
was,
your
honor,
that
the
--
they
would've
been
tight
and
uncomfortable
if
he
had
worn
them.
there's
nothing
to
rebut
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
there
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
there
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
he
did
your
honor,
in
his
confession.
he
later
denied
it.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
but
in
his
confession
he
admitted
that
the
shorts
were
his.
and
so
i
submit
that
the
relevant
question
is
whether
they
did
contain
blood.
if
they
did
contain
blood,
this
was
the
critical
point.
the
presence
of
paint
in
addition
to
the
blood,
i
respectfully
submit,
was
immaterial.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
found
--
a
policeman
found
them
in
a
old
abandoned
apartment
building
which
was
referred
to
at
that
time
as
the
van
buren
flats.
in
his
confession,
he
stated
that
he
had
discarded
them
in
the
van
buren
flats,
but
if
i
remember
the
testimony
correctly,
the
police
had
found
it
before
his
confession
if
i'm
not
mistaken
on
that
point.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
perhaps
it
was
in
the
statement
of
mr.
christensen
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
you
don't
find
it
there.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
my
recollection
from
the
record
is
that
he
was
shown
the
flats
and
he
stated
that
they
were
--
i
maybe
in
error
on
that.
it
was
my
recollection
from
reading
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
i
remember
that
point,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
reading
of
the
record
that
the
items
were
found
before
the
confession.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
petitioner
has
claimed
that
they
are,
your
honor.
as
i
read
that
section
that
he
referred
to,
i
was
not
--
i
thought
it
was
ambiguous
which
way
they
were
referring
to
it.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
there
were
knowing
misrepresentation
to
closing
argument,
i
would
say
it
would
be
very
significant,
your
honor.
if
there
was
no
evidence,
however,
brought
out
that
he
deliberately
misstated
anything,
it
is
possible
that
a
mistake
could
occur
in
--
by
prosecution
in
closing
argument
which
would
not
be
deliberate
mistake
and
would
not
amount
to
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
argument
that
you
are
referring
to,
your
honor,
is
on
page
375
of
the
volume
printed
by
this
court,
volume
4,
your
honor.
and
it
relates
to
the
jacket
of
my
--
attorney
for
the
petitioner
in
form
where
he
relates
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
about
the
middle
of
the
page
i
believe,
your
honor.
they
could
not
have
known,
but
when
they
put
it
there
to
find,
the
jacket
was
found
where
he
had
said
he
had
put
it.
words
are
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
beg
your
--
375,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
we
turn
then
your
honors
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
that
they
found
it
before
the
confession,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
that
is
--
as
i
read
that,
your
honor,
i
am
not
absolutely
clear
just
what
the
meaning
of
it.
if
you
interpret
that
as
saying
that
we
took
his
--
what
he
told
us
and
went
out
and
there
we
found
it
then
it
would
be
untrue,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
we
turn
then
to
the
question
of
the
advice
to
mrs.
baxter
that
she
had
a
right
not
to
talk
to
the
defense
in
this
case.
now,
mrs.
baxter
testified
at
the
pardon
and
parole
proceedings
that
she
had
been
receiving
many
calls
and
was
being
bothered
by
the
defense
attorney
and
she
was,
in
her
words,
perturbed.
she
called
up
the
state's
attorney
and
asked
what
the
situation
was.
he
told
her
in
effect
that,
“you
have
a
right
not
to
talk
to
the
defense
if
you
want
to.”
this
is
corroborated
by
his
own
testimony
at
the
district
court
where
he
testified
that
he
told
other
witnesses
amongst
her
that
by
request
that
they
had
a
right
not
to
talk
to
the
defense
and
they
must
make
up
their
own
mind
whether
they
wanted
to
or
not.
now,
we
submit
that
this
statement
is
absolutely
correct.
absent
a
subpoena
to
some
particular
hearing,
every
private
individual
has
a
right
not
only
to
talk
not
to
the
defense,
but
not
to
talk
to
the
prosecution,
absent
an
appropriate
subpoena.
we
submit
that
there
was
absolutely
no
violation
of
any
rights
in
respect
to
that
statement.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
let
me
correct
that
statement.
just
--
my
understanding,
your
honor
is
with
that
the
court
said
that
rather
than
the
prosecution.
the
court
said,
“if
you
will
state
to
me
that
she
is
unreliable
in
some
way,
i
will
allow
you
to
call
her
as
a
court's
witness.
if
you
do
not
so
state
then
i
will
give
you
great
latitude
in
asking
leading
questions
and
various
examinations
you
want,
but
i
will
not
call
her
as
a
court
witness.”
they
then
refused
that
offer
--
they
refused
the
court's
offer
to
have
called
her
and
have
this
great
leeway
in
question
--
with
respect
to
leading
questions.
i
assume
they
testified
because
they
did
not
want
to
be
bound
by
the
testimony
of
someone
whom
they
did
not
know
who
was
going
to
testify.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
it
is
--
the
question
is
pretty
much
within
the
discretion
of
the
court,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
think
it's
subject
to
review
for
abuse
in
the
same
way
as
the
scientific
evidence
was
as
i
referred
earlier
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
that
if
the
court
--
if
you
can
show
some
reason
to
the
court
why
he
should
be
called
as
the
court's
witness,
that
he
pretty
well
usually
is.
the
court,
in
exercise
of
its
discretion
in
this
case,
merely
believed
that
they
had
not
shown
sufficient
grounds
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
that
regard.
we
turn
then
to
the
question
of
the
unreliable
witness,
betty
baldwin,
not
betty
baldwin-curry.
the
prosecution
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case
contends
that
the
prosecution
was
in
error
for
calling
that
witness
when
they
knew
that
she
was
unreliable.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
there
is
absolutely
no
constitutional
requirement
that
prohibits
the
calling
of
a
witness,
who
in
the
past
has
not
been
believed
if,
and
this
is
the
big
if,
they
do
believe
her
testimony
on
this
occasion.
now,
on
this
occasion,
the
evidence
is
rather
complete
that
at
least
two
people
so
testified
that
they
fully
believed
her
on
this
occasion.
on
that
basis,
they
called
her
and
we
believe
that
it
is
a
proper
to
call
a
witness
whose
testimony
you
believe
even
though
at
some
past
occasion
you
may
not
have
believed
this
witness'
testimony.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well,
there
is
another
factor
in
that
regard,
your
honor.
when
--
if
the
she
had
told
the
police
that
she
knew
him
at
the
time
of
the
crime
for
five
weeks.
now,
this
question
was
asked
at
the
trial
which
was
ten
months
after
the
crime.
how
long
have
you
known
him,
not
how
long
had
you
known
him
your
honor,
not
how
long
had
you
known
him
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
but
how
long
have
you
known
him,
which
means
from
the
present
past.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
correct
answer
to
that
would
have
been
11
months,
because
she
had
known
him
at
the
time
that
question
was
asked
for
11
months.
now,
i
submit
your
honor,
that
to
allow
that
to
go
unrefuted
is
absolutely
immaterial.
there
is
no
materiality
at
all
in
this
record
to
the
significance
of
whether
that
she
had
known
him
11
months
or
two
years.
the
defendant
states
there
is
some
materiality
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
you
mean
as
to
the
--
where
as
to
the
formal
questioned
asked?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
i
have
it
right
here,
your
honor,
it's
in
volume
2,
--
volume
2
page
702
at
the
top
of
the
page.
at
the
very
top
of
the
page,
your
honor,
it
refers
“do
you
know
the
defendant
lloyd
eldon
miller?”
she
said,
“yes
sir.”
“how
long
have
you
known
him?”
“approximately
two
years.”
the
principle
--
there
is
concluding
that
thought
your
honor
also
if
there's
a
contention
under
napue
versus
illinois
that
they
allowed
knowing
testimony
to
go
in
the
record
as
they
did
not
contradict
that
statement.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
they
were
aware
of
the
statement
was
made.
now,
there
was
the
fact
that
that
statement
had
been
made
to
the
prosecution,
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
had
gone
down
that
statement
and
checked
every
one
of
her
answers
against
them,
i'm
sure
they
knew
it
in
substance.
but
this
was
such
a,
i
submit,
immaterial
point
that
they
probably
didn't
even
realize
that
she
was
violating
the
statement
that
they
had
given,
or
at
least
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
had,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
honor,
what
you
say
is
very
--
is
in
substance.
now,
i
know
of
only
one
prior
occasion
that
she
had
made
a
story
about
another
crime
that
was
this
narcotics
story.
with
respect
to
that
statement,
she
was
given
a
lie
detector
test
to
check
whether
it
was
right.
the
result
was
inconclusive.
they
said
that
they
found
--
they
did
not
believe
her,
although
the
test
was
inconclusive
and
that
they
were
going
to
drop
the
matter.
the
only
other
instance
that
i
can
think
of
which
talks
to
their
--
to
the
unreliability
relates
to
the
statement
that
mr.
malmgren,
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
had
tried
to
coerce
this
witness.
now,
as
far
as
i
read
the
record
in
this
case,
those
claims
have
never
been
disproving,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
was
--
the
statement
that
they
believe
was
not
true
of
hers
related
to
the
narcotics
story,
your
honor.
there
was
no
evidence
one
way
or
another
whether
they
believed
the
story
with
respect
to
the
attorney
malmgren.
however,
they
did
--
the
statement
--
the
prosecution
did
say,
“let's
not
get
that
question
out
of
this
case
so
there'll
be
no
question
of
prejudice,”
you
know,
to
the
defendant
by
the
fact
that
his
attorney
made
the
some
question
of
improper
statements
to
a
prosecution
witness.
so
that
was
how
it
all
advanced
and
was
either
the
last
statement
in
the
record
on
that
your
honor
is
that
it
either
still
pending
or
is
been
dismissed.
i
assume
it
has
been
dismissed,
but
there
has
never
been
a
hearing
on
it.
it
has
never
been
proved
conclusively
one
way
or
another
whether
that
allegation
was
correct
or
not.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
can
be
basically
summarized
into
two
broad
categories,
one,
the
lack
of
access
to
certain
information,
and
secondly,
the
validity
of
the
admission
of
his
confession
at
the
trial.
concerning
first,
the
issue
of
the
defense's
access
to
information
perhaps
their
most
significant
issue
is
that
of
the
finding
of
the
hair.
now,
with
respect
to
this
issue,
it
is
important
to
first
determine
what
was
revealed
and
what
was
not
revealed.
at
the
district
court,
when
the
petitioner
testified,
he
testified
that
when
in
those
same
proceedings
he
had
heard
the
state's
attorney
testify
as
to
the
result
of
this
examination.
this
was
the
first
he
had
ever
heard
about
that
hair.
however,
this
conclusion
is
cast
into
doubt
by
his
testimony
at
the
trial
itself.
now,
i'm
talking
about
the
chambers
testimony
that
he
gave
when
the
question
of
his
--
the
admissibility
of
his
confession
first
arose
for
the
determination
by
the
court
before
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
at
that
time,
he
testified
that
in
effect
he
testified,
“they
took
some
pubic
hairs
from
me.
they
told
me
that
another
hair
that
it
matched
with.
i
demand
to
look
in
the
comparative
microscope.
i
looked,
and
i
said
those
hairs
don't
match.
i'm
just
using
the
exact
language
with
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
this
was
the
petitioner,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
defendant
at
the
trial,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
--
he
testified
to
it,
your
honor.
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
un-contradicted
testimony
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
that
that
is
a
fair
statement
on
the
basis
of
this
record
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'll
give
you
the
exact
language,
your
honor.
try
volume
4,
the
court
will
refer
to
this
as
the
brown
record,
volume
4,
page
91
in
273
and
95.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
first
we'll
start,
your
honor
with
page
90.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
at
that
point,
he
testified,
about
the
middle
of
the
second
paragraph
on
page
--
first
full
paragraph
on
page
90.
also,
they
took
a
small
quantity
of
hair
from
around
my
privates.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
this
was
on
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
at
page
95
then
your
honors,
i
refer
you
next
to
that,
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
95.
he
says,
“i
was
in
this
little
room
at
all
times
in
the
evening
of
november
30,
except
for
one
time
when
i
demanded
to
look
through
the
microscope
my
own
self,
because
they
said
these
hairs
belong
to
me.
mr.
lich
made
a
statement
to
me
that
certain
hairs
belonged
to
me.
he
showed
me
some
hairs
there.
i
demanded
to
go
back
and
he
took
me
there
back
into
the
laboratory
and
a
small
room
which
appeared
to
be
a
microscope
room.
and
i
looked
down
and
i
said
them
hairs
don't
match.
i
said
them
hairs
don't
belong
to
me.
and
the
chemist
just
looked
at
me
and
smiled.”
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'm
not
positive
whether
this
--
yes
on
november
30,
he
was
arrested
on
the
28,
i
believe,
this
was
the
30th.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
confession
is
the
30th,
your
honor,
the
same
day
in
which
he
was
confronted
with
these
hairs.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
thought
i
did,
your
honor,
i
was
looking
for
it
and
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
273,
well
that's
just
a
repetition
of
the
first
statement,
your
honor.
this
is
at
his
testimony,
this
narrows
his
testimony,
i
believe,
before
the
jury.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
this
is
his
testimony
before
the
jury
at
273.
all
he
testified
here
your
honor
is
he
said,
“then
they
took
a
bunch
of
hairs
from
around
my
privates.”
mr.
richard
a.
michael
apparently
so,
your
honor.
i'm
trying
to
--
yes,
this
was
before
the
jury.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
testified
only,
your
honor,
that
they
took
some
hair
from
him.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
no
your
honor,
not
as
he
did
before
the
--
and
before
the
court
in
private
when
he
testified
that
they
had
showed
him
this
hair.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
before
the
jury,
no
your
honor,
or
before
in
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
before
the
jury,
it
was
sworn
testimony.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
was
cross-examined,
but
i
don't
believe
about
that
--
the
point
that
we're
talking
about,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
record,
yes
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
all
i
can
do
is
make
an
inference
from
the
record,
your
honor.
my
inference
from
the
record
is
that
they
did
have
this
report
showing
that
it
was
not
his
hair,
and
therefore
never
raised
that
issue
at
trial.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
no
i
beg
to
differ
with
you
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
fact
is
that
this
interrogation
as
we
said
came
back
the
30th.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
was
taken
place
in
november
30th.
they
did
not
get
the
report,
the
scientific
report
as
to
the
result
of
the
comparison
of
these
hairs
until
december
15,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
perhaps
the
person
who
looked
in
the
comparison
microscope
thought
they
did,
but
the
record
is
--
has
no
information
to
guide
us
along
those
lines
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well,
i
think
that
that
is
an
inference
that
the
prosecution
made
at
the
--
made
and
i
think
that
i
would've
done
this
if
i
were
to
try
to
contradict
that
it
as
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
certainly,
it
was
found
on
a
kleenex
that
it
had
been
used
to
take
a
vaginal
smear.
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
fair
to
make
the
assumption
that
that
came
from
the
vagina
of
the
girl.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
i
do
not
your
honor.
the
report
of
the
chemist
merely
identified
that
was
hair
of
human
origin.
that
is
as
far
as
we
know.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
followed
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
would
you
repeat
it
again,
please?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
they
should
have
revealed
it.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well,
of
course
we
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
think
as
the
prosecution,
your
honor,
that
certainly
if
i
had
this
sort
of
information
that
i
would
not
introduce
into
my
case
in
chief,
no.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
oh,
if
were
defending,
yes
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
we
are
of
course,
your
honor,
dealing
in
a
realm
of
supposition
here.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
submit
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
when
we
had
before
the
jury,
his
own
confession,
a
admission
that
he
made
to
betty
baldwin,
and
we
have
the
profession
of
prior
admission
of
guilt,
the
fact
of
a
hair
in
the
vagina
which
did
not
match
his,
i
submit
to
you,
would
not
have
changed
the
result
before
that
jury.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
make
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
make
the
representation
your
honor
that
the
record
shows
that
it
was
a
hair
of
human
origin.
that
it
does
not
show
that
it
was
pubic
hair.
it
does
not
show
that
it
was
not
a
pubic
hair.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
do
contend
that
it
was
not
shown
to
be
a
pubic
hair,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
honor,
i
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
the
duty
to
disclose
is
not
present
for
three
reasons.
first,
i
submit
that
in
effect,
we
can
look
at
it
that
there
was
really
no
nondisclosure
at
all.
he
was
told,
according
to
the
petitioner's
testimony
that
a
hair
was
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim
that
it
matched
his
--
i
beg
your
pardon
that
his
were
taken
for
comparison
purposes
and
a
comparison
was
going
to
be
made.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
there
was
a
denial
by
the
petitioner,
your
honor.
he
was
allowed
to
look
into
the
microscope
and
said
those
hairs
don't
match.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
does
it
say
they
didn't?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
believe
there
is
some
burden
here
your
honor
upon
the
prosecution
--
upon
the
defense.
this
statement
was
made
in
the
--
the
statement
was
made,
the
question
could've
been
asked
by
the
defense.
the
defense
could've
made
a
motion
for
--
the
defense
knew
your
honor
that
there
was
a
hair
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim.
they
knew
that
his
were
being
taken
for
comparison
purposes.
they
never
--
they
had
enough
information
your
honor
in
closing
argument
and
nothing
else
had
been
done
to
make
--
to
argue
in
closing
argument
to
say,
“ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
the
state
knew
that
there
was
hair
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim.”
the
state
took,
mere
comparison
with
the
defendant's
and
they
never
introduced
that
at
trial,
except
the
information
was
totally
in
the
hands
of
the
defense,
the
inference
can
be
drawn
that
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor,
the
prosecution.
the
inference
can
be
drawn
that
that
hair
was
--
that
that
evidence
was
unfavorable.
they
had
that
amount
of
information
in
their
possession,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
honor,
we
of
course
start
with
the
--
with
your
proposition
with
brady
versus
maryland
holds
that
evidence
favorable
to
an
accused
relevant
material
to
the
evidence
of
either
guilt
or
punishment
in
the
hands
of
the
--
on
request,
must
be
revealed.
we
start
with
that
as
our
basic
proposition.
so
then
we
ask
on
applying
that
proposition
to
the
facts
of
the
--
if
i
may,
to
the
facts
of
this
case
first.
we
submit
that
first
there
was
really
no
nondisclosure.
we
submit
that
he
knew
the
hair
was
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim.
we
knew
that
his
were
being
taken
for
comparison
purposes.
we
know
that
he
stated
on
the
record
that
those
hairs
did
not
match
him
that
that
was
never
denied.
as
thus
interpreted,
he
knew
the
hair
was
found.
he
knew
what
comparison
was
made.
he
knew
that
they
didn't
matched,
if
we
can
put
any
credence
in
his
own
ability
to
compare,
and
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
hair
examination
to
know
that
if
a
layman
looks
in
that
he
can
see
whether
it's
obvious
that
hairs
match
or
do
not
match.
but
nevertheless,
he
admittedly
denied
it,
immediately
upon
looking
on
it,
immediately
denied
it
and
that
denial
was
never
denied.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
a
proper
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
assume,
your
honor
that
if
one,
you
can
see
the
materiality
of
this
testimony.
now,
i
must
add
in
answering
this
question
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
based
their
decision
on
this
point
upon,
the
question
of
materiality
of
the
evidence.
the
district
court
stated
the
hair
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim
was
of
not
consequence
and
did
not
prejudice
the
petitioner's
case.
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
that
hair
was
in
the
vagina
was
of
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime,
and
they
further
held
that
on
the
basis
of
the
damaged
condition
of
the
body,
it
could've
been
deposited
by
anybody
who
had
examined
the
body
or
anybody
who
had
handled
the
body
since
the
crime.
that
was
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
so,
but
if
we
assume
the
materiality
of
the
evidence,
if
we
assume
a
proper
request
was
made
as
envisioned
by
brady
versus
maryland,
i
then
ask
you
that
that
information
would
have
to
be
divulged,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
amongst
the
exhibits
now.
maybe
you
know
that
it
is
not
presently
amongst
the
exhibit.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
it
is
in
existence,
i
do
not
know
where
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
he
did
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
there
was
no
doctor's
report
on
that,
your
honor.
there
was
a
chemist
report.
the
chemist
did
not
--
only
reported
that
it
was
hair
of
human
origin,
probably
of
human
origin.
he
uses
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
was
or
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
was
not,
but
i
just
am
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
beg
your
pardon,
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor,
i
consider
that
that's
significant.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
don't
think
that
they
have
shown
either
the
materiality
or
the
reasonableness,
your
honor.
now,
one
thing
that
is
to
be
noted
with
respect
to
that
motion
is
that
they
ask
for
the
evidence
that
the
state
is
going
to
introduce.
the
hair
wasn't
even
introduced
as
very
technically
interpreted.
the
motion
does
not
even
apply
to
the
hair.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
testimony,
your
honors,
states
that
amongst
the
physical
evidence
seen
was
hair
and
hairs.
it
does
not
define
determining
further,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
testimony
does
not
state
how
it
was,
your
honor.
all
it
states
is
that
“what
evidence
did
you
see
when
you
examined
it?”
“i
saw
hairs.”
he
stated
it,
he
didn't
state
whether
it
was
in
vial
or
how
it
was.
i
assumed
it
was
in
the
vial
because
that
at
least
was
the
way
it
went
to
the
chemist.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
first
they
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
i
read
the
record
your
honor,
first
they
were
allowed
to
view
the
evidence
personally.
then
they
made
the
motion
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
made
the
motion
to
view
the
evidence
as
i
read
it
prior
to
the
motion
to
make
the
scientific
examination
of
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
am
not
aware,
your
honor,
whether
it
was
just
granted
by
the
prosecution
or
whether
there
was
a
court
order
on
that.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
court
does
not.
the
--
in
the
court
the
state's
attorney
was
asked
why
he
opposed
that
motion,
and
he
testified
your
honor
that
he
opposed
it
because
they
--
he
could
not
be
assured.
he
was
not
assured
that
the
evidence
would
not
be
--
the
chain
of
evidence
would
not
be
some
way
destroyed
by
the
tests
that
were
going
to
be
taken.
that
is
why
he
opposed
it,
the
reason
--
the
ruling
of
the
judge,
however,
is
not
in
the
record.
the
reason
or
the
ruling
of
the
judge
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
we
turn
then
your
honors
to
the
question
of
the
bloody
shorts.
now,
the
chemist
for
the
state
literally
testified
at
the
trial
--
testified
at
the
trial
that
the
shorts
did
contain
blood.
and
the
state's
attorney
also
testified
--
stated
in
argument
referred
to
these
shorts
as
bloody
shorts.
now,
at
the
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
do
not
think
the
record
indicated
that
he
pointed
to
any
spot,
your
honor.
it
said
this
is
blood.
he
referred
to
the
document
in
general
as
the
bloody
shorts.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no
statement
was
made
to
the
jury
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know
that
there
was
any
paint
on
these.
there
was
then
therefore,
the
jury
would,
i
assume
allow
to
draw
the
inference
that
all
the
spots
were
those
of
blood.
on
the
other
hand,
i
do
not
think
any
direct
statement
was
made
any
given
spot
or
all
spots
were
blood.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
in
the
district
court
they
did
make
a
scientific
examination
of
all
the
evidence.
one
martin,
a
chemist
employed
by
the
petitioner
here,
took
12
strands
at
out
of
the
more
heavily
stained
areas
of
that
garment,
12
fibers.
he
examined
those
12
fibers,
each
out
of
one
of
the
heavily
stained
areas.
his
testimony
was
that
ten
of
the
fibers
contained
paint.
one
of
the
fibers
are
kind
of
a
carbon
substance
and
one
of
the
fibers
an
unidentified
substance.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
is
correct,
the
only
motion
from
the
scientific
examination
was
the
one
that
we
have
referred
to
with
respect
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
generally
speaking,
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
granted,
your
honor.
the
general
rule
under
illinois
law
is
that,
it
was
enunciated
by
the
court
by
the
way
in
reviewing
this
case,
is
that
there
is
a
qualified
--
red-light
lining
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
allow
the
defense
to
make
scientific
evidence
of
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
there
were
no
further
basis
than
that
your
honor,
i
submit
that
yes
it
would
be.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
could
be
reviewed
however
for
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
if
there
were
no
reason
at
all
for
denying
a
motion
to
make
scientific
evidence,
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
in
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
to
the
extent
that
brady
versus
maryland
so
enunciates
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
report
of
the
state's
expert
on
that
your
honor
was
that
he
had
examined
it,
he
had
found
paint
and
he
made
no
--
i
take
it
back,
he
had
found
blood
and
he
made
no
test
for
any
other
substance.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
chemist
did
not,
your
honor.
the
state's
attorney
in
the
district
court
did
testify
that
he
knew
that
all
of
the
stains
on
it
were
not
blood.
that
is
all
we
have
in
the
record
on
that
issue.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
so
testified
in
the
district
court,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
certainly
referred
to
the
bloody
shots.
of
course,
the
report
of
the
short
hand
report,
it
would
not
indicate
whether
he
was
waiving
it
or
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
richard

michael
yes,
your

testified

that

knew
that

of

spots
were
paint,
i
would
assume.
mr.
richard

michael
right,
your
honor.
he
testified
only
that

had
examined
for
blood

he
had
made
no
other
tests
on

would

litterly's

it
stated,
“i
examined

tested
people's
exhibit

to
determine
the
nature
of
the
staining
material
thereon.
that
result
of
the
first
test
was
that
this
material
upon
the
shorts
is
blood.
i
made
a
second
examination
it's
as
close
as
the
blood
of
human
origin
and
made
a
further
examination
which
disclosed
that
the
blood
was
of
group
a.”
that
was
his
testimony
at
that
time.
mr.

pardon
me?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i'm
not
sure
that
he
ever
did.
it
was
the
state's
attorney
who
conceded
that
he
knew
that
some
of
the
stains
were
not
blood,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
we
submit
that
on
this
issue,
your
honors,
the
critical
point
is
whether
there
was
blood
on
these
shorts.
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
there
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
there
is
blood
on
these
shorts,
your
honor,
and
the
mere
testimony
by
the
prosecution
only
is
that
there
are
--
is
blood
in
these
shorts.
and
if
they
do
refer
to
them
as
bloody
shorts,
if
there
is
blood
on
them,
i
submit
that
even
though
there's
also
paint,
there
is
no
going
beyond
the
truth,
if
you
will,
as
indicated
by
napue.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
however,
the
chemist
for
the
prosecution
did
testify
that
he
had
no
opinion
today
as
to
whether
there
was
any
blood
on
it
or
not.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
except
for
one
stain,
your
honor
that
is
unidentifiable
in
origin.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
it
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
would
think
not
only
under
illinois
but
under
the
decision
of
this
court
it
would
have
been,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
sir.
however,
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
the
point
i
was
making
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
the
petitioner
did
testify
in
his
confession,
admitted
in
his
confession
that
these
were
his
shorts.
the
critical
issue
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
it
is
in
the
record,
your
honor
on
before
--
it
appears
really
in
two
places.
one,
mr.
christensen
who
took
the
confession,
testified
as
to
what
he
said
to
him
during
the
interrogation
and
then
another
time
that
mr.
baudino
read
his
confession
into
the
record.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
mr.
christensen's
statement
begins
on
128,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
this
would
be
the
trial
transcript,
your
honor,
the
brown
covered
by
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
volume
4.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
no.
then
you
have
the
--
we
are
looking
now,
your
honor,
for
the
--
where
the
confession.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
there's
nothing
at
all,
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
would
you
excuse
me?
the
confession
your
honor
of
the
defendant
was
right
under
the
record
of
page
144.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
he
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
testimony
was,
your
honor,
that
the
--
they
would've
been
tight
and
uncomfortable
if
he
had
worn
them.
there's
nothing
to
rebut
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
there
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
no,
there
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
he
did
your
honor,
in
his
confession.
he
later
denied
it.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
but
in
his
confession
he
admitted
that
the
shorts
were
his.
and
so
i
submit
that
the
relevant
question
is
whether
they
did
contain
blood.
if
they
did
contain
blood,
this
was
the
critical
point.
the
presence
of
paint
in
addition
to
the
blood,
i
respectfully
submit,
was
immaterial.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
they
found
--
a
policeman
found
them
in
a
old
abandoned
apartment
building
which
was
referred
to
at
that
time
as
the
van
buren
flats.
in
his
confession,
he
stated
that
he
had
discarded
them
in
the
van
buren
flats,
but
if
i
remember
the
testimony
correctly,
the
police
had
found
it
before
his
confession
if
i'm
not
mistaken
on
that
point.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
perhaps
it
was
in
the
statement
of
mr.
christensen
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
you
don't
find
it
there.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
my
recollection
from
the
record
is
that
he
was
shown
the
flats
and
he
stated
that
they
were
--
i
maybe
in
error
on
that.
it
was
my
recollection
from
reading
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
is
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
as
i
remember
that
point,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
reading
of
the
record
that
the
items
were
found
before
the
confession.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
petitioner
has
claimed
that
they
are,
your
honor.
as
i
read
that
section
that
he
referred
to,
i
was
not
--
i
thought
it
was
ambiguous
which
way
they
were
referring
to
it.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
there
were
knowing
misrepresentation
to
closing
argument,
i
would
say
it
would
be
very
significant,
your
honor.
if
there
was
no
evidence,
however,
brought
out
that
he
deliberately
misstated
anything,
it
is
possible
that
a
mistake
could
occur
in
--
by
prosecution
in
closing
argument
which
would
not
be
deliberate
mistake
and
would
not
amount
to
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
the
argument
that
you
are
referring
to,
your
honor,
is
on
page
375
of
the
volume
printed
by
this
court,
volume
4,
your
honor.
and
it
relates
to
the
jacket
of
my
--
attorney
for
the
petitioner
in
form
where
he
relates
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
about
the
middle
of
the
page
i
believe,
your
honor.
they
could
not
have
known,
but
when
they
put
it
there
to
find,
the
jacket
was
found
where
he
had
said
he
had
put
it.
words
are
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
beg
your
--
375,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes,
your
honor.
we
turn
then
your
honors
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
that
they
found
it
before
the
confession,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
if
that
is
--
as
i
read
that,
your
honor,
i
am
not
absolutely
clear
just
what
the
meaning
of
it.
if
you
interpret
that
as
saying
that
we
took
his
--
what
he
told
us
and
went
out
and
there
we
found
it
then
it
would
be
untrue,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
we
turn
then
to
the
question
of
the
advice
to
mrs.
baxter
that
she
had
a
right
not
to
talk
to
the
defense
in
this
case.
now,
mrs.
baxter
testified
at
the
pardon
and
parole
proceedings
that
she
had
been
receiving
many
calls
and
was
being
bothered
by
the
defense
attorney
and
she
was,
in
her
words,
perturbed.
she
called
up
the
state's
attorney
and
asked
what
the
situation
was.
he
told
her
in
effect
that,
“you
have
a
right
not
to
talk
to
the
defense
if
you
want
to.”
this
is
corroborated
by
his
own
testimony
at
the
district
court
where
he
testified
that
he
told
other
witnesses
amongst
her
that
by
request
that
they
had
a
right
not
to
talk
to
the
defense
and
they
must
make
up
their
own
mind
whether
they
wanted
to
or
not.
now,
we
submit
that
this
statement
is
absolutely
correct.
absent
a
subpoena
to
some
particular
hearing,
every
private
individual
has
a
right
not
only
to
talk
not
to
the
defense,
but
not
to
talk
to
the
prosecution,
absent
an
appropriate
subpoena.
we
submit
that
there
was
absolutely
no
violation
of
any
rights
in
respect
to
that
statement.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
let
me
correct
that
statement.
just
--
my
understanding,
your
honor
is
with
that
the
court
said
that
rather
than
the
prosecution.
the
court
said,
“if
you
will
state
to
me
that
she
is
unreliable
in
some
way,
i
will
allow
you
to
call
her
as
a
court's
witness.
if
you
do
not
so
state
then
i
will
give
you
great
latitude
in
asking
leading
questions
and
various
examinations
you
want,
but
i
will
not
call
her
as
a
court
witness.”
they
then
refused
that
offer
--
they
refused
the
court's
offer
to
have
called
her
and
have
this
great
leeway
in
question
--
with
respect
to
leading
questions.
i
assume
they
testified
because
they
did
not
want
to
be
bound
by
the
testimony
of
someone
whom
they
did
not
know
who
was
going
to
testify.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
i
think
it
is
--
the
question
is
pretty
much
within
the
discretion
of
the
court,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
think
it's
subject
to
review
for
abuse
in
the
same
way
as
the
scientific
evidence
was
as
i
referred
earlier
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
that
if
the
court
--
if
you
can
show
some
reason
to
the
court
why
he
should
be
called
as
the
court's
witness,
that
he
pretty
well
usually
is.
the
court,
in
exercise
of
its
discretion
in
this
case,
merely
believed
that
they
had
not
shown
sufficient
grounds
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
that
regard.
we
turn
then
to
the
question
of
the
unreliable
witness,
betty
baldwin,
not
betty
baldwin-curry.
the
prosecution
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case
contends
that
the
prosecution
was
in
error
for
calling
that
witness
when
they
knew
that
she
was
unreliable.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
there
is
absolutely
no
constitutional
requirement
that
prohibits
the
calling
of
a
witness,
who
in
the
past
has
not
been
believed
if,
and
this
is
the
big
if,
they
do
believe
her
testimony
on
this
occasion.
now,
on
this
occasion,
the
evidence
is
rather
complete
that
at
least
two
people
so
testified
that
they
fully
believed
her
on
this
occasion.
on
that
basis,
they
called
her
and
we
believe
that
it
is
a
proper
to
call
a
witness
whose
testimony
you
believe
even
though
at
some
past
occasion
you
may
not
have
believed
this
witness'
testimony.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
well,
there
is
another
factor
in
that
regard,
your
honor.
when
--
if
the
she
had
told
the
police
that
she
knew
him
at
the
time
of
the
crime
for
five
weeks.
now,
this
question
was
asked
at
the
trial
which
was
ten
months
after
the
crime.
how
long
have
you
known
him,
not
how
long
had
you
known
him
your
honor,
not
how
long
had
you
known
him
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
but
how
long
have
you
known
him,
which
means
from
the
present
past.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
correct
answer
to
that
would
have
been
11
months,
because
she
had
known
him
at
the
time
that
question
was
asked
for
11
months.
now,
i
submit
your
honor,
that
to
allow
that
to
go
unrefuted
is
absolutely
immaterial.
there
is
no
materiality
at
all
in
this
record
to
the
significance
of
whether
that
she
had
known
him
11
months
or
two
years.
the
defendant
states
there
is
some
materiality
--
mr.
richard
a.
michael
you
mean
as
to
the
--
where
as
to
the
formal
questioned
asked?
mr.
richard
a.
michael
yes
i
have
it
right
here,
your
honor,
it's
in
volume
2,
--
volume
2
page
702
at
the
top
of
the
page.
at
the
very
top
of
the
page,
your
honor,
it
refers
“do
you
know
the
defendant
lloyd
eldon
miller?”
she
said,
“yes
sir.”
“how
long
have
you
known
him?”
“approximately
two
years.”
the
principle
--
there
is
concluding
that
thought
your
honor
also
if
there's
a
contention
under
napue
versus
illinois
that
they
allowed
knowing
testimony
to
go
in
the
record
as
they
did
not
contradict
that
statement.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
they
were
aware
of
the
statement
was
made.
now,
there
was
the
fact
that
that
statement
had
been
made
to
the
prosecution,
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
had
gone
down
that
statement
and
checked
every
one
of
her
answers
against
them,
i'm
sure
they
knew
it
in
substance.
but
this
was
such
a,
i
submit,
immaterial
point
that
they
probably
didn't
even
realize
that
she
was
violating
the
statement
that
they
had
given,
or
at
least
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
had,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
your
honor,
what
you
say
is
very
--
is
in
substance.
now,
i
know
of
only
one
prior
occasion
that
she
had
made
a
story
about
another
crime
that
was
this
narcotics
story.
with
respect
to
that
statement,
she
was
given
a
lie
detector
test
to
check
whether
it
was
right.
the
result
was
inconclusive.
they
said
that
they
found
--
they
did
not
believe
her,
although
the
test
was
inconclusive
and
that
they
were
going
to
drop
the
matter.
the
only
other
instance
that
i
can
think
of
which
talks
to
their
--
to
the
unreliability
relates
to
the
statement
that
mr.
malmgren,
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
had
tried
to
coerce
this
witness.
now,
as
far
as
i
read
the
record
in
this
case,
those
claims
have
never
been
disproving,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
michael
that
was
--
the
statement
that
they
believe
was
not
true
of
hers
related
to
the
narcotics
story,
your
honor.
there
was
no
evidence
one
way
or
another
whether
they
believed
the
story
with
respect
to
the
attorney
malmgren.
however,
they
did
--
the
statement
--
the
prosecution
did
say,
“let's
not
get
that
question
out
of
this
case
so
there'll
be
no
question
of
prejudice,”
you
know,
to
the
defendant
by
the
fact
that
his
attorney
made
the
some
question
of
improper
statements
to
a
prosecution
witness.
so
that
was
how
it
all
advanced
and
was
either
the
last
statement
in
the
record
on
that
your
honor
is
that
it
either
still
pending
or
is
been
dismissed.
i
assume
it
has
been
dismissed,
but
there
has
never
been
a
hearing
on
it.
it
has
never
been
proved
conclusively
one
way
or
another
whether
that
allegation
was
correct
or
not.
thank
you,
your
honors.
