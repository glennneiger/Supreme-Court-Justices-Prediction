is
there
any

of
the
statement?
justice

black
i
understand
that
it
was
hearsay
--
justice

--
but
it
was
in
without
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
question
about
the
accuracy?
justice
hugo

black
have
you
made
any
efforts
to
find
out?
justice

black
asked
a

justice

black
did
you
ask
a
doctor?
justice

l.
black
so
did
they
had
the
type
a
blood
but
it
didn't
show
the
time
that
she
had
it,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
do
you
tell
by
looking
at
it
that's
paint
and
not
blood?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
motion
made
directly
and
specifically
to
the
judge,
stating
that
this
was
not
blood
but
was
paint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that
he
made
a
motion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
have
to
have
a
scientific
investigation
there.
what
kind
of
scientific
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
time
relevance
here
or
importance
of
the
length
of
time
she
had
known
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
importance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
importance
that
you
attribute
to
the
statement
that
a
witness
didn't
have
to
talk
to
somebody
on
the
outside
if
he
didn't
want
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
did
cut
the
defense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
a
person
who
doesn't
have
a
right
to
refuse
to
talk
to
somebody
and
tell
him
about
the
facts
of
the
case
before
they
put
him
on
the
stand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
were
asked
a
question,
what
is
wrong
with
saying
if
you
don't
think
you
have
to
just
talk
to
him
unless
you
want
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
admitting
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
asking
is,
do
you
claim
that
because
of
anytime
of
trial,
a
person
has
got
to
talk
to
the
lawyers
or
defendant
in
the
case
if
he
doesn't
want
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
i
can't
understand
the
great
emphasis
because
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
the
prosecution
voluntarily
went
out
of
their
way
to
tell
a
witness
that
they
didn't
have
to
talk
--
i
don't
understand.
that
might
have
been
thought
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
asked
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
she
had
to
testify.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
she
had
to
talk
to
him.
and
he
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
she
didn't
have
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
whole
circumstance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
but
i
think
it's
perfect
and
normal
thing,
it
seems
to
me,
if
one
person
calls
of
another
and
asking
the
lawyer,
“do
i
have
to
talk
on
the
outside?”
and
said
“no.”
i
don't
quite
understand
the
great
emphasis
you
put
on
there.
it
may
have
it
but
i
don't
yet
quite
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
who
had
been
allowed
can
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
if
the
defense
counsel
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
gotten
this
witness
to
talk,
he
could
have
found
out
more
than
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
do
you
attribute
some
wrongdoings
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
answer
the
question
and
saying
you
don't
have
to
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh!
you
think
that
she
did
not
have
a
right
to
refrain
from
talking
on
the
outside
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
said
so
far,
you've
made
it
after
her,
but
she
called
the
prosecutor,
you've
said
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
ask
if
she
had
to
talk
to
this
man
and
he
said
no.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
claim
legal
error
for
a
prosecuting
attorney
to
make
that
answer,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
asked
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
they
had
it
and
was
presented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
couldn't
they
protect
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
turned
over
to
them
to
look
at.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
turned
over
to
them
to
look
at
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
suppose
it
should
have
been
surrendered
to
them
really.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
the
state
would
want
to
keep
it
if
it
was
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
the
state
would
want
to
keep
it
if
it
was
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
thought
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
said
that
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
did
you
say
another
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
273?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
tell
the
jury
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
he
testified
before
the
jury
about
the
hair,
did
he
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
that
because
the
state
decided
it
was
not
his
hair?
do
you
know
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
that
pubic
hair
now
or
that
hair?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
existence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
doctor
who
made
the
report
record
whether
it
was
a
pubic
hair
or
not
a
pubic
hair?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
not
report
whether
it
was
pubic
hair.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
testimony
about
whether
there
could've
been
any
hair
there
from
her
own
body
at
her
age?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
now
whether
it
was
a
pubic
hair
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
way
to
prove
it
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
honor,
i
beg
to
differ
with
you,
i
do
not
think
they
had
it
at
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
if
they
had
it,
it
would
now
be
on
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
the
reason
that
it
was
not,
i
assume,
it's
because
was
never
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
there
was
--
it
was
not
given
that
significance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
turn
then
to
the
aspect
of
brady
versus
maryland
that
requires
a
--
brady

maryland
says
that
nondisclosure
upon

constitutes
a
violation
of

justice
hugo
l.
black
your
honor,
in
the
light
of
this
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
time
they
saw
that
after
they
made
this
motion?
justice
hugo

black
after
they
made
motion
on
page
2,
was
that
when
they
saw
the
physical
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
were
allowed
to
look
at
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
the
question
first
come
up
about
the
paint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
of
about
how
that
paint
got
on
those
shorts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
this
man's
occupation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked,
what
was
his
occupation?
as
i
recall
it
was
evidence
of
him
being
a
taxi
driver.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
not
a
painter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
they
get
the
shorts,
from
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
he
agreed
that
--
he
conceded
that
they
had
been
left
at
this
place
and
they
found
these
at
that
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
probably
might
be
accountable
for
your
error.
justice

l.

is
there
any

about
the
accuracy
of
the
