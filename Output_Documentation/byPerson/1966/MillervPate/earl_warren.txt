chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
see
what
before
--
before
trial
but
after
--
after
their
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
hair
observable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
called
to
their
attention
that
there
was
such
a
thing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
vial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
shown
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
shown
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
the
petitioner's
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
counsel
do
about
this
when
--
on
it,
wherein
from
the
petitioner
that
he
had
told
the
interrogators
it
wasn't
his
hair?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
mean
they
did
nothing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
it
was
a
valuable
evidence
for
--
for
the
defendant
now,
in
this
proceeding,
it's
certainly
would
have
been
valuable
evidence
to
him
then
and
if
counsel
was
taking
cognizance
of
what
would
help
him,
he
would
think
they
would
make
some
kind
of
an
effort
to
have
it
determined.
there's
a
fact
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
it
was
his
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
why
they
have
lawyers
with
more
two
years
education
and
to
take
care
of
his
rights
in
the
courtroom
that
would
think.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
--
did
they
state
why
they
wanted
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
say
it
to
him
it
was
because
the
defendant
said
that
was
not
his
hair
and
that
they
wanted
to
examine
that
particular
item
of
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
ask
you
before
we
adjourned
if
the
doctor
who
made
this
--
this
test
of
the
material
in
the
--
in
the
vial
testified
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
--
did
he
say
anything
about
the
hair
being
attached
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
asked
by
counsel
from
cross-examination
whether
there
was
any
such
thing
in
the
vial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
mention
of
it
by
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
either
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
--
we'll
recess
now
mister.
chief
justice
earl
warren
petitioner
versus
frank
j.
pate,
warden.
mr.
lassers,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask?
how
did
the
testimony
of
the
little
girl
who
had
type
a
blood
get
into
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say,
she
did
not
testify
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
shape
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
based
upon
what
did
she
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
if
she
had
the
type
of
blood
any
time
she
would
always
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
find
any
in
'63?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
state,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
obvious
is
that
--
is
the
red
part
of
it
that
you
attribute
to
paint
than
they
attribute
to
blood
on
the
shorts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
obvious
is
the
paint
on
the
shorts
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
repulsive
as
it
maybe,
would
you
open
it
up
so
i
can
see
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
any
question
about
it
that
what
everything
we
can
see
there
is
paint.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
state
contends
that
anything
that
can
be
seen
on
there
now
is
blood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
--
i
understand,
mr.
lassers
that
the
defense
tried
to
call
this
lady,
mrs.
baxter
at
the
trial,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
tried
to
--
because
they
couldn't
talk
to
her
after
the
prosecution
had
told
her
that
she
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
talk
to
him.
they
asked
the
court
to
let
them
examine
her
as
a
court
witness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
prosecution
said
that
they
would
only
do
that
if
the
defense
admitted
her
unreliability
and
the
court
on
that
objection
refuse
let
her
be
examined
as
a
court
witness.
is
that
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
statement
based
upon
that
she
was
unreliable.
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
i
understand
that
but
i
mean,
has
anything
developed
since
to
indicate
that
mrs.
baxter
was
not
reliable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
affidavit
of
the
prosecution
as
to
what
she
said
fit
with
the
theory
of
their
case
as
it
was
tried?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenfield.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ghost
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
question
as
to
whether
this
was
a
pubic
hair
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
confession
that
the
--
that
was
introduced
at
the
trial
contested
of
being
having
been
coerced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
did
the
--
did
the
defendant
testify
on
that
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
he
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
testify
at
that
time
that
the
police
told
him
they
had
found
the
hair
that
matched
with
his?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
when
that
was
raised
by
the
defendant,
did
the
prosecution
respond
to
it
in
anyway?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
michael.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
again
did
you
say
mr.
--?
what
page
did
you
say
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
90,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
cross-examined
on
that
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
was
counsel
correct
when
he
said
that
the
state
made
no
mention
about
the
--
of
the
hairs
in
the
whole
file?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
tell
him
that
they
did
match?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
this
is
impertinent.
when
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
confession
made
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
when
the
defendant
told
the
court
that
while
he
was
in
jail
they
had
shown
him
--
they
had
told
him
first
that
his
pubic
hairs
matched
with
those
found
in
the
girl,
and
that
he
been
looked
at
the
microscope
and
--
himself
and
then
said,
“those
are
not
--
those
don't
match.
they're
not
my
hairs.”
and
the
state
had
this
report
from
its
own
laboratory
to
the
effect
that
they
did
not
match.
do
you
not
think
there
was
an
obligation
on
the
state
to
disclose
the
fact
that
it
did
have
such
a
report
and
that
it
was
consistent
with
what
the
defendant
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
understand
that
he
testified
that
they
said
that
they
did
match
his
and
that
there's
no
denial
on
that
on
the
part
of
the
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
the
state
had
already
told
him
that
they
did
match
and
he
says
that
they
didn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
by
the
time
the
hearing
came
on,
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
state
had
a
record
from
its
laboratory
to
the
effect
that
they
did
not
match.
now,
do
you
not
think
that
those
are
burden
on
the
--
on
the
state
to
admit
to
the
court
that
that
was
a
fact
rather
than
leave
it
to
the
court
to
believe
that
what
they
had
told
him
about
the
matching
was
true
and
that
what
he
said
about
the
not
matching
was
not
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
wondering
certainly
that
would
not
make
any
difference
to
us
here
for
our
observation
but
certainly
the
state
must
have
that
vial
if
that
was
in,
wouldn't
they,
at
this
time
while
the
case
is
still
pending?
they
had
it
on
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
certainly
they
must
have
it
now.
they
wouldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
have
destroyed
it,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
pardon
me,
i
understood
that
from
the
counsel
that
it
was
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
misunderstood
what
counsel
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
think
it's
significant
within
brady
and
maryland
there
was
in
fact
a
request?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
request
that
we
made
in
this
case
for
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
at
this
particular
time
would
the
defense
have
known
what
the
prosecution
was
going
to
introduce
by
way
of
physical
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
make
--
state
any
reason
as
to
why
it
was
denying
him
a
right
to
examine?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
before
you
get
to
the
district
court.
if
the
prosecuting
attorney
describe
the
blood
that
was
on
them
or
the
amount
of
it,
or
did
he
make
any
representation
as
to
whether
this
is
blood
on
the
shorts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
are
more
than
spots
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
covered
with
something
which
they
now
say
is
paint.
and
i
wonder
if
was
that
represented
to
the
jury
in
any
way
as
being
the
blood
stained
shorts
without
distinguishing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
--
may
i
ask
this,
did
the
report
of
the
state's
experts
who
examined
these
shorts
report
that
the
major
portion
of
what's
on
there
is
paint?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
made
no
reference
in
his
report
that
the
--
that
what
is
so
observable
there
is
paint
and
not
blood?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
he
said
also,
“with
regard
to
those
that
can
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye,
you
knew
at
the
time
of
trial,
didn't
you,
that
those
spots
that
could
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
were
not
blood
spots.
you
knew
that,
didn't
you?”
“well
not
conclusively.
i
had
knowledge
from
a
chemist
that
there
was
blood
on
it.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
that's
his
further
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
what
page
is
that
on
do
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
there
was
some
evidence
in
one
of
the
proceedings
to
the
effect
that
these
shorts
did
not
fit
the
defendant.
is
there
anything
from
the
prosecution
to
rebut
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
rebuttal
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
anything
to
show
that
the
confirmation
of
the
man
had
changed
in
the
years
that
he
was
either
fatter
or
thinner
at
the
time
this
testimony
was
taken
and
at
the
time
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
michael,
i
gather
the
impression
from
reading
the
phrase
that
the
state
in
introducing
the
confession
and
the
presentation
of
its
case
told
the
jury
or
left
the
impression
with
the
jury
that
he
have
had
obtained
the
confession
of
the
defendant
and
then
had
verified
it
through
these
things
and
that
they
had
found
these
things
as
a
result
of
the
confession.
and
i
gather
the
impression
also
that
there
had
been
evidence
later
produced
to
show
that
they
had
these
things
before
the
confession
and
verify
them
by
this
confession.
now,
did
the
state
deny
the
latter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
at
any
time
represented
to
the
jury
that
these
things
were
found
afterwards
as
a
result
of
that
confession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
think
that's
--
that
might
be
important?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
neither
that
an
important
thing,
it
seems
to
me,
whether
these
things
were
found
and
developed
as
a
result
of
the
plain
confession
that
he
made
or
whether
they
had
these
things
and
before
the
confession
and
did
not
report
it
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that,
the
upper
part
of
the
volume?
chief
justice
earl
warren
275?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
did
--
is
--
which
is
true,
that
they
did
find
this
thing
after
the
confession
or
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
this,
while
it
might
not
have
been
with
intention
to
deceive,
but
was,
untrue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
about
her
testimony
when
it
was
offered
and
when
the
court
was
asked
for
permission
to
permit
her
testimony
as
a
court
witness.
the
prosecution
said
they
would
consent
to
it
only
if
her
unreliability
was
conceded.
now,
why
would
that
--
is
that
a
normal
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
test
of
whether
a
person
--
the
defendant
should
be
entitled
to
call
a
witness
as
the
court's
witness
that
he
must
admit
that
there's
some
unreliability?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
one
would
they
believe?
which
part
of
her
testimony
would
they
believe,
for
in
the
court,
she
said
she
had
known
him
for
two
years
and
prior
to
that
time
she
had
told
the
police
that
she
knew
him
for
five
weeks?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
the
citation
to
that,
but
don't
take
the
time
to
look.
if
you
don't
know,
don't
bother.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
whether
they
said,
“how
long
have
you
known
him?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
michael,
may
i
ask
you
concerning
this
witness
if
it
is
the
fact
that
they
have
concluded
before
this
proceeding
that
this
witness
had
made
a
false
accusation
against
another
person
for
a
crime
that
she
said
he
had
confessed
to
her
but
was
not
true.
and
then
also
that
she
had
made
another
one
which
was
under
investigation
and
which
the
experts
found
that
it
was
inconclusive
but
they
believed
that
she
was
not
telling
the
truth
and
that
the
county
authorities
who
prosecuted
this
case
suggested
that
they
discontinue
the
investigation
of
the
truth
of
that
statement
until
this
case
was
tried
so
she
could
be
a
witness
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
that
there
was
an
investigation
of
that,
and
the
authorities
indicated
that
they
thought
that
was
not
true,
but
the
people
who
prosecuted
this
case
suggested
that
the
investigation
be
discontinued
until
after
the
trial
of
this
case.

chief

did
they
see
what
before
--
before

but
after
--
after
their
--
chief

was
the
hair
observable?
chief

was
it
called

that
there
was

from

that

well,
this
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
it
was
a
valuable
evidence
for
--
for
the
defendant
now,
in
this
proceeding,
it's
certainly
would
have
been
valuable
evidence
to
him
then
and
if
counsel
was
taking
cognizance
of
what
would
help
him,
he
would
think
they
would
make
some
kind
of
an
effort
to
have
it
determined.
there's
a
fact
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
it
was
his
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
why
they
have
lawyers
with
more
two
years
education
and
to
take
care
of
his
rights
in
the
courtroom
that
would
think.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
--
did
they
state
why
they
wanted
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
say
it
to
him
it
was
because
the
defendant
said
that
was
not
his
hair
and
that
they
wanted
to
examine
that
particular
item
of
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
ask
you
before
we
adjourned
if
the
doctor
who
made
this
--
this
test
of
the
material
in
the
--
in
the
vial
testified
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
--
did
he
say
anything
about
the
hair
being
attached
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
asked
by
counsel
from
cross-examination
whether
there
was
any
such
thing
in
the
vial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
mention
of
it
by
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
either
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
--
we'll
recess
now
mister.
chief
justice
earl
warren
petitioner
versus
frank
j.
pate,
warden.
mr.
lassers,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask?
how
did
the
testimony
of
the
little
girl
who
had
type
a
blood
get
into
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say,
she
did
not
testify
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
shape
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
based
upon
what
did
she
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
if
she
had
the
type
of
blood
any
time
she
would
always
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
find
any
in
'63?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
state,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
obvious
is
that
--
is
the
red
part
of
it
that
you
attribute
to
paint
than
they
attribute
to
blood
on
the
shorts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
obvious
is
the
paint
on
the
shorts
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
repulsive
as
it
maybe,
would
you
open
it
up
so
i
can
see
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
any
question
about
it
that
what
everything
we
can
see
there
is
paint.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
state
contends
that
anything
that
can
be
seen
on
there
now
is
blood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
--
i
understand,
mr.
lassers
that
the
defense
tried
to
call
this
lady,
mrs.
baxter
at
the
trial,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
tried
to
--
because
they
couldn't
talk
to
her
after
the
prosecution
had
told
her
that
she
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
talk
to
him.
they
asked
the
court
to
let
them
examine
her
as
a
court
witness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
prosecution
said
that
they
would
only
do
that
if
the
defense
admitted
her
unreliability
and
the
court
on
that
objection
refuse
let
her
be
examined
as
a
court
witness.
is
that
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
statement
based
upon
that
she
was
unreliable.
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
i
understand
that
but
i
mean,
has
anything
developed
since
to
indicate
that
mrs.
baxter
was
not
reliable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
affidavit
of
the
prosecution
as
to
what
she
said
fit
with
the
theory
of
their
case
as
it
was
tried?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenfield.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ghost
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
question
as
to
whether
this
was
a
pubic
hair
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
confession
that
the
--
that
was
introduced
at
the
trial
contested
of
being
having
been
coerced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
did
the
--
did
the
defendant
testify
on
that
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
he
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
testify
at
that
time
that
the
police
told
him
they
had
found
the
hair
that
matched
with
his?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
when
that
was
raised
by
the
defendant,
did
the
prosecution
respond
to
it
in
anyway?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
michael.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
again
did
you
say
mr.
--?
what
page
did
you
say
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
90,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
cross-examined
on
that
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
was
counsel
correct
when
he
said
that
the
state
made
no
mention
about
the
--
of
the
hairs
in
the
whole
file?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
tell
him
that
they
did
match?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
this
is
impertinent.
when
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
confession
made
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
when
the
defendant
told
the
court
that
while
he
was
in
jail
they
had
shown
him
--
they
had
told
him
first
that
his
pubic
hairs
matched
with
those
found
in
the
girl,
and
that
he
been
looked
at
the
microscope
and
--
himself
and
then
said,
“those
are
not
--
those
don't
match.
they're
not
my
hairs.”
and
the
state
had
this
report
from
its
own
laboratory
to
the
effect
that
they
did
not
match.
do
you
not
think
there
was
an
obligation
on
the
state
to
disclose
the
fact
that
it
did
have
such
a
report
and
that
it
was
consistent
with
what
the
defendant
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
understand
that
he
testified
that
they
said
that
they
did
match
his
and
that
there's
no
denial
on
that
on
the
part
of
the
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
the
state
had
already
told
him
that
they
did
match
and
he
says
that
they
didn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
by
the
time
the
hearing
came
on,
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
state
had
a
record
from
its
laboratory
to
the
effect
that
they
did
not
match.
now,
do
you
not
think
that
those
are
burden
on
the
--
on
the
state
to
admit
to
the
court
that
that
was
a
fact
rather
than
leave
it
to
the
court
to
believe
that
what
they
had
told
him
about
the
matching
was
true
and
that
what
he
said
about
the
not
matching
was
not
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
wondering
certainly
that
would
not
make
any
difference
to
us
here
for
our
observation
but
certainly
the
state
must
have
that
vial
if
that
was
in,
wouldn't
they,
at
this
time
while
the
case
is
still
pending?
they
had
it
on
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
certainly
they
must
have
it
now.
they
wouldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
have
destroyed
it,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
pardon
me,
i
understood
that
from
the
counsel
that
it
was
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
misunderstood
what
counsel
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
think
it's
significant
within
brady
and
maryland
there
was
in
fact
a
request?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
request
that
we
made
in
this
case
for
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
at
this
particular
time
would
the
defense
have
known
what
the
prosecution
was
going
to
introduce
by
way
of
physical
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
make
--
state
any
reason
as
to
why
it
was
denying
him
a
right
to
examine?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
before
you
get
to
the
district
court.
if
the
prosecuting
attorney
describe
the
blood
that
was
on
them
or
the
amount
of
it,
or
did
he
make
any
representation
as
to
whether
this
is
blood
on
the
shorts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
are
more
than
spots
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
covered
with
something
which
they
now
say
is
paint.
and
i
wonder
if
was
that
represented
to
the
jury
in
any
way
as
being
the
blood
stained
shorts
without
distinguishing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
--
may
i
ask
this,
did
the
report
of
the
state's
experts
who
examined
these
shorts
report
that
the
major
portion
of
what's
on
there
is
paint?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
made
no
reference
in
his
report
that
the
--
that
what
is
so
observable
there
is
paint
and
not
blood?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
he
said
also,
“with
regard
to
those
that
can
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye,
you
knew
at
the
time
of
trial,
didn't
you,
that
those
spots
that
could
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
were
not
blood
spots.
you
knew
that,
didn't
you?”
“well
not
conclusively.
i
had
knowledge
from
a
chemist
that
there
was
blood
on
it.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
that's
his
further
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
what
page
is
that
on
do
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
there
was
some
evidence
in
one
of
the
proceedings
to
the
effect
that
these
shorts
did
not
fit
the
defendant.
is
there
anything
from
the
prosecution
to
rebut
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
rebuttal
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
anything
to
show
that
the
confirmation
of
the
man
had
changed
in
the
years
that
he
was
either
fatter
or
thinner
at
the
time
this
testimony
was
taken
and
at
the
time
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
michael,
i
gather
the
impression
from
reading
the
phrase
that
the
state
in
introducing
the
confession
and
the
presentation
of
its
case
told
the
jury
or
left
the
impression
with
the
jury
that
he
have
had
obtained
the
confession
of
the
defendant
and
then
had
verified
it
through
these
things
and
that
they
had
found
these
things
as
a
result
of
the
confession.
and
i
gather
the
impression
also
that
there
had
been
evidence
later
produced
to
show
that
they
had
these
things
before
the
confession
and
verify
them
by
this
confession.
now,
did
the
state
deny
the
latter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
at
any
time
represented
to
the
jury
that
these
things
were
found
afterwards
as
a
result
of
that
confession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
think
that's
--
that
might
be
important?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
neither
that
an
important
thing,
it
seems
to
me,
whether
these
things
were
found
and
developed
as
a
result
of
the
plain
confession
that
he
made
or
whether
they
had
these
things
and
before
the
confession
and
did
not
report
it
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that,
the
upper
part
of
the
volume?
chief
justice
earl
warren
275?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
did
--
is
--
which
is
true,
that
they
did
find
this
thing
after
the
confession
or
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
this,
while
it
might
not
have
been
with
intention
to
deceive,
but
was,
untrue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
about
her
testimony
when
it
was
offered
and
when
the
court
was
asked
for
permission
to
permit
her
testimony
as
a
court
witness.
the
prosecution
said
they
would
consent
to
it
only
if
her
unreliability
was
conceded.
now,
why
would
that
--
is
that
a
normal
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
test
of
whether
a
person
--
the
defendant
should
be
entitled
to
call
a
witness
as
the
court's
witness
that
he
must
admit
that
there's
some
unreliability?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
one
would
they
believe?
which
part
of
her
testimony
would
they
believe,
for
in
the
court,
she
said
she
had
known
him
for
two
years
and
prior
to
that
time
she
had
told
the
police
that
she
knew
him
for
five
weeks?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
the
citation
to
that,
but
don't
take
the
time
to
look.
if
you
don't
know,
don't
bother.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
whether
they
said,
“how
long
have
you
known
him?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
michael,
may
i
ask
you
concerning
this
witness
if
it
is
the
fact
that
they
have
concluded
before
this
proceeding
that
this
witness
had
made
a
false
accusation
against
another
person
for
a
crime
that
she
said
he
had
confessed
to
her
but
was
not
true.
and
then
also
that
she
had
made
another
one
which
was
under
investigation
and
which
the
experts
found
that
it
was
inconclusive
but
they
believed
that
she
was
not
telling
the
truth
and
that
the
county
authorities
who
prosecuted
this
case
suggested
that
they
discontinue
the
investigation
of
the
truth
of
that
statement
until
this
case
was
tried
so
she
could
be
a
witness
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
that
there
was
an
investigation
of
that,
and
the
authorities
indicated
that
they
thought
that
was
not
true,
but
the
people
who
prosecuted
this
case
suggested
that
the
investigation
be
discontinued
until
after
the
trial
of
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lassers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
