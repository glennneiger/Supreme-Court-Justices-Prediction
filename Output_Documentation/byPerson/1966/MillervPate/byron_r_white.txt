justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
--
could
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
proof
that
he
were
at
any
stage
in
supplementary
proceeding,
or
otherwise,
that
the
pubic
hair
was
actually
found
in
the
vagina?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
person
who
actually
took
the
smear
never
testified
that
he
found
a
hair
in
the
vagina?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
only
an
inference
from
the
fact
that
the
hair
was
in
the
vial?
that
--
that
you
think
it
came
from
the
vagina
at
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
wholly
aside
of
how
you
characterized
it,
that's
what
it
rest
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
she
have
to
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
she
didn't
testify
in
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
contend
that
the
state
had
information
about
what
mrs.
baxter
might
testify
to
and
didn't
reveal
it
to
the
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
ever
asked
in
the
'63
hearing?
didn't
you
--
did
you
go
into
that
matter
whether
these
facts
which
mrs.
baxter
--
would
you
know
mrs.
baxter
would
testify
to
it?
did
you
ask
the
prosecution
whether
they
lose
out
in
'56?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
so,
she's
given
--
she
essentially
gave
two
different
stories
there.
one
in
the
prosecution
and
one
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
the
prosecution
--
that's
the
prosecution's
claim,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
your
claim
that
she
has
testified
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
it
exhibited?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
at
that
point,
could
the
--
could
the
matter
of
the
examination
had
been
pursued
which
had
been
previously
turned
down.
you
told
to
mr.
justice
fortas
that
there
had
been
a
motion
and
a
denial
in
may.
and
when
it
was
the
--
when
the
physical
evidence
was
finally
exhibited
to
the
defense,
at
that
point,
did
the
defense
had
an
opportunity
to
pursue
the
matter
of
an
examination?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
attempt
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
time
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
states
view
on
the
significance
on
the
fact
that
on
december
15,
the
state
learned
that
these
hairs
did
not
match.
and
that
the
state
apparently
concedes
that
the
hair
found
on
the
smear
came
from
the
girl.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
means
your
brief,
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
concede
the
hair
came
from
the
vagina
of
the
girl.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
agree
that
it
was
a
pubic
hair?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
--
let's
assume
the
defense
had
information
that
a
hair
was
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
little
girl
and
that
it
didn't
match
the
pubic
hair
of
the
defendant.
i
would
suppose
the
defense
would've
put
that
testimony
on
before
the
jury,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
wonder
if
the
information
the
state
had
on
december
15th
from
that
report
was
of
great
interest
for
the
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
don't
--
unless
we
break
that
in
two
parts,
let's
forget
about
should've
revealed
from
then.
if
you
were
defending
and
had
that
kind
of
information,
would
you
introduce
it
to
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
if
you
were
defending.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
--
how
typical
do
that
in
this
case
--
differently
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
litterly
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
didn't
make
test
on
the
non-blood.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
order
to
--
he
tested
for
blood
but
he
didn't
find
blood
in
some
of
those
spots.
at
least
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
his
testimony.
he
knew
that
some
of
the
stains
were
not
blood,
so
he
did
test
the
stains
for
blood.
and
if
the
prosecuting
attorney
knew
at
the
time
that
some
of
the
stains
were
not
blood,
the
only
source
of
information
could
be
from
mr.
litterly,
i
presume.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
his
source
of
information
would
i
assume
be
a
written
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
what
the
prosecuting
attorney
knew?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
--
there's
no
mention
here
that
some
of
the
stains
were
not
blood.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
where
did
the
prosecuting
attorney
get
his
information
that
some
of
the
stains
were
not
blood?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
mr.
litterly's
testimony?
he
did
testify
that
some
of
the
stains
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
testimony
at
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
then
say
--
he
didn't
make
any
mention
at
all
as
to
other
stains,
did
he,
in
his
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
thank
you
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
one
last
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court,
did
you
rely
on
the
ground
of
coerced
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
district
court
rule
on
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
you
--
this
is
not
the
first
time
you've
raised
the
issue
of
coerced
confession
in
this
court,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
raised
it
below,
on
the
preserved
two
points
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
--
could
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice

was
