mr.
maurice
rosenfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
two
amici,
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
illinois
division
and
the
chicago
radio
station,
wait.
the
amici
are
here
because
they
believe
of
what
is
said
to
be
a
ghost
which
stalks
the
legal
system.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
what
is
said
to
be
a
ghost,
which
stalks
the
legal
system,
the
possibility
of
sentencing
an
innocent
man
to
death
has
come
to
life
in
this
case.
we
believe
it
has
come
to
life
in
this
case.
we
argue
that
police
and
prosecutor
indecency
measured
by
due
process
standards,
concealed
the
innocence
of
this
accused,
petitioner
here.
the
controlling
case
is
brady
against
maryland.
and
the
crucial
point
is
the
suppression
of
an
official
report
of
the
state
bureau
of
criminal
identification
and
investigation
to
the
effect
that
here,
found
in
the
vagina
of
a
victim
was
not
that
of
the
accused.
the
crucial
point
is
that
this
report
was
suppressed
for
eight
years.
it
was
known
to
the
prosecution.
it
was
sent
to
the
prosecution.
the
prosecutors
admitted
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
they
knew
about
it.
the
report
was
never
disclosed.
it
was
brought
to
life
for
the
first
time
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
hairs
were
not
admitted
at
the
trial
at
all.
nothing
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
no
evidence
at
the
trial
at
all
on
hairs.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
all
we
know.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
about
the
hair.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
one
way
or
the
other
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
crucial
point.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
official
report
of
the
state
--
criminal
investigation
department
was
exonerated,
totally
exonerated.
it's
impossible
for
the
mind
to
conceive
of
any
explanation
for
that
hair
of
being
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim,
other
than
it
was
a
hair
of
the
attacker.
and
this,
we
are
told
by
recognized
police
manuals,
all
of
the
police
manuals,
happens
frequently
in
rape
and
sex
cases.
in
fact,
the
cardinal
principle
in
the
investigation
of
such
cases
according
to
the
police
manuals
is
to
search
for
hairs.
that
was
done.
now,
the
fact
that
it
was
in
the
vagina,
stands
admitted
on
this
record
by
the
attorney
general
of
illinois.
no
question
has
been
raised
about
that,
no
one
has
ever
raised
that
question.
and
the
critical
point
is
the
suppression
of
the
report
which
is
not
an
inference,
that's
null
and
that's
admitted.
the
report
was
never
disclosed.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
we
know
for
comparative
purposes,
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
pubic
hair
was
taken
from
the
accused.
the
nature
of
the
hair
in
the
child's
vagina
is
not
exactly
known.
inference,
i
would
think
that
it
is
pubic
because
the
hair,
the
forensic
medicine
books
tell
us
that
hairs
have
different
characteristics
from
the
different
parts
of
the
body
but
i
can't
say
that
there's
anything
in
the
record.
all
we
know
that
it
was
a
hair,
the
probability
is
that
it
was
a
pubic
hair
in
the
vagina
of
an
eight-year-old
child.
now
the
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
there
was
a
written
report.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
which
came
from
the
department
of
criminal
investigation.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
no
sir.
it
contained
a
vaginal
smear,
a
vaginal
--
a
vaginal
smear
from
the
child.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
vaginal
smear
was
examined
by
the
state
department
and
the
hair
was
discovered
by
the
state
department.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
when
the
accused
was
taken
into
custody,
one
of
the
--
virtually,
the
first
act
the
police
did
was
to
take
a
pubic
hair
from
him
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
--
for
comparative
purposes.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
at
that
point,
they
recognized
with
the
size
of
significance
of
the
hair
in
the
vial.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
were
compared
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
--
and
found
to
be
a
mismatch.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
so
reported.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
was
sent
to
the
prosecution.
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecution,
the
facts
that
were
known
to
the
prosecution
and
that
is
what
i
meant
to
be
saying
is
the
report
that
was
suppressed.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
was
--
the
hair
in
the
container
was
not
identified
in
the
report
as
a
pubic
hair.
in
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice
warren
a
moment
ago,
i
said
that
i
thought
the
probability
was
high
that
it
was
a
pubic
hair
because
pubic
hairs
are
known
to
have
different
characteristics
from
hairs
of
--
from
other
parts
of
the
body.
however,
the
report
does
not
say
that.
it
does
state
that
the
hair
of
the
accused
which
was
compared
was
a
pubic
hair
and
therefore
it
was
found
to
be
a
mismatch.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
sir
is
exactly
my
point.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
was
vigorously
contested
as
having
been
coerced.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
obviously
does
not
meet
miranda
standards
but
i'm
not
arguing
that
point.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
defendant
did
testify
both
in
chambers,
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
before
the
jury.the
defendant
denied
--
at
that
point,
he
has
denied
consistently
from
that
moment
that
he
had
ever
confessed.
he
is
claiming
that
the
paper
he
signed,
he
didn't
know
what
the
paper
was
that
it
was
a
--
he
was
coaxed
into
signing
this
paper
in
order
to
avoid
going
to
the
electric
chair
after
52
hours
of
interrogation.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
all
52
hours
involved
interrogation
after
52
hours
of
detention.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
he
testified
at
that
time
and
the
episode
is
somewhat
garbled.
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
it
because
it
was
never
known
until
eight
years
later
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
the
state
report
existed,
exonerating
report
existed.
at
that
time,
he
testified
that
somewhere
during
the
52
hours
of
detention,
he
was
somehow
told
that
hair
has
incriminated
him.
that's
all
it
appears
that
that
hair
is
somehow
incriminated
him.
it
does
not
appear
that
it
was
told
that
a
hair
was
in
the
child's
vagina.
he
was
simply
told
that
the
hair
has
incriminated
him.
he
asked,
he
jumped
to
the
microscope
himself
and
said
let
me
look
and
“them
hairs
don't
match”.
this
is
his
testimony
at
the
trial
in
the
trial
record
and
it's
all
we
know
about
the
hair
episode.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
did
not
respond
to
it.
it
did
not
respond
to
it
any
way.
it
was
not
counted.
when
--
i
might
say
this
mr.
chief
justice,
when
the
accused
counsel
were
permitted
to
look
at
the
state's
evidence,
there
were
hair,
hairs
were
among
the
evidence
exhibited
to
them
but
no
--
not
the
report
just
for
hairs
as
evidence
that
the
state
would
rely
upon,
so
as
counsel
would
be
jumped
or
they
form
the
opinion
if
the
hairs
were
somehow
favorable
to
the
state.
hairs
were
among
the
evidence
exhibited
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
some
point
before
the
--
at
some
point
before
the
trial.
not
the
report.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
did
not
have
an
opportunity.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
asked.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
at
that
--
i
don't
--
all
that
appears
in
the
record
is
that
they
ask
several
times.
how
many
times?
we
don't
know.
the
prosecutor
testified
for
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
they
asked
continuously.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
asked
for
permission
to
examine
the
physical
evidence,
the
point
that
mr.
lassers
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
were
permitted
to
look
at
it.
look
--
simply
to
look
at
it.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
i
don't
know.
they
were
just
permitted
to
look
at
it.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
or
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
don't
know.
the
record
is
silent
at
it.
so
i
simply
don't
know.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
or
it
was
just
--
or
it
was
just
open
to
their
examination
and
--
at
some
place
or
some
point.
mr.
lassers
tells
me,
in
the
presence
of
the
sheriff,
they
were
permitted
to
see
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
none
of
these
things
were
surrendered
to
them.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that's
--
if
this
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
so
the
district
court
but
all
things
there
were
made
available
for
scientific
--
for
examination
by
the
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
by
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
was
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
was
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
it
was
at
the
hearing
on
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
in
which
he
was
recounting
chronologically
what
happened
to
him
during
the
52-hour
incommunicado
detention
period.
now,
the
treatment
of
this
point
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
does
not
show.
the
report
certainly
was
not,
the
exonerating
report.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
offered
no
hairs
as
part
of
their
case.
now,
the
attorney
general
in
response
to
all
of
these
about
the
hair
offers
two
points.
one
point
is
a
formal
one
that
no
request
was
made
by
the
accused
counsel
of
--
for
the
evidence
we
claim
was
suppressed.
this,
we
are
submitting
to
your
honors,
that
the
brady
against
maryland
cannot
be
read
as
requiring
such
a
request
and
we
have
cited
the
case,
u.s.
versus
wilkins
decided
by
judge
thurgood
marshall
which
reviews
all
the
authorities
on
this.
incidentally,
this
point
was
very
similar
to
the
point
that
bothered
the
court
before
the
jencks
case.
it
was
very
much
the
same
point
that
a
report
was
available
to
contradict
and
the
question
was
raised
and
the
point
was
made
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
the
jencks
case
that
how
could
anyone
be
expected
to
know
the
contents
of
report
they
hadn't
seen.
the
other
point
that
the
attorney
general
makes
is
that
the
accused
himself
somehow
knew
because
of
this
colloquy
that
took
place
during
the
52-hour
detention
period.
note,
the
attorney
general
is
in
the
awkward
position
of
claiming
that
the
accused
--
a
statement
they
made
to
the
accused
that
hairs
matched
is
to
be
treated
as
fulfillment
of
their
obligation
under
the
constitution
to
disclose
that
the
hairs
did
not
match.
now,
there
was
no
disclosure
at
all
that
the
hair
within
the
child's
vagina
didn't
match
the
accused
hair.
there
was
simply
some
general
garble
conversation
during
this
long
detention
period
about
hairs.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
he's
been
in
the
death
house
ten
years.
he's
approximately
30
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
his
conviction.
he's
40
years
here
of
age.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
never
so
identified,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that's
just
what
i'm
saying
yes
sir.
now,
an
electrocution
for
this
man
was
averted
six
hours
before
it
was
to
occur
only
as
a
result
of
the
intervention
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
case.
the
district
court
reached
the
correct
result
perhaps
for
wrong
reasons.
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
wrong
result
for
clearly
wrong
reasons.
and
we
ask
this
court
to
reach
the
right
result
for
the
right
reason.
i
thank
you.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
assume
that
they
--
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
question
your
honor
is
that
they
were
given
the
right
to
view
all
the
physical
evidence
in
the
case.
he
made
that
motion.
they
were
allowed
to
go
in.
they
were
allowed
to
view
all
the
physical
evidence
in
the
case.
now,
they
could've
based
--
the
hair
was
seen
of
record
that
they
saw
the
hairs
when
they
made
that
view.
a
motion
--
in
addition
of
the
fact,
that
the
defense
knew
that
the
hair
was
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim,
knew
that
hair
of
petitioner
was
taken
for
comparison
purposes.
i
do
not
submit
that
it
is
too
great
a
burden
on
the
prosecution
--
on
the
defense.
i
beg
your
pardon,
to
make
a
motion
for
their
result
of
that
examination.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
two
amici,
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
illinois
division
and
the
chicago
radio
station,
wait.
the
amici
are
here
because
they
believe
of
what
is
said
to
be
a
ghost
which
stalks
the
legal
system.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
what
is
said
to
be
a
ghost,
which
stalks
the
legal
system,
the
possibility
of
sentencing
an
innocent
man
to
death
has
come
to
life
in
this
case.
we
believe
it
has
come
to
life
in
this
case.
we
argue
that
police
and
prosecutor
indecency
measured
by
due
process

concealed
the

of

here.
the

is

to
the
effect
that
here,
found

of
a
victim
was
not
that
of
the
accused.
the
crucial
point
is
that
this
report
was
suppressed
for
eight
years.
it
was
known
to
the
prosecution.
it
was
sent
to
the
prosecution.
the
prosecutors
admitted
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
that

about

was
never

it
was
brought
to
life
for

first
time
in

habeas

proceeding
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
hairs
were
not
admitted
at
the
trial
at
all.
nothing
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
no
evidence
at
the
trial
at
all
on
hairs.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
all
we
know.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
about
the
hair.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
one
way
or
the
other
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
crucial
point.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
official
report
of
the
state
--
criminal
investigation
department
was
exonerated,
totally
exonerated.
it's
impossible
for
the

to

for
that

of
being

and
this,
we
are

that
was
done.
now,
the
fact
that
it
was
in
the
vagina,
stands
admitted
on
this
record
by
the
attorney
general
of
illinois.
no
question
has
been
raised
about
that,
no
one
has
ever
raised
that
question.
and
the
critical
point
is
the
suppression
of
the
report
which
is
not
an

that's
null
and
that's
admitted.
the
report
was
never
disclosed.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
we
know
for
comparative
purposes,
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
pubic
hair
was
taken
from
the
accused.
the
nature
of
the
hair
in
the
child's
vagina
is
not
exactly
known.
inference,
i
would
think
that
it
is
pubic
because
the

the

that

now
the
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
there
was
a
written
report.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
which
came
from
the
department
of
criminal
investigation.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
no
sir.
it
contained
a
vaginal
smear,
a
vaginal
--
a
vaginal
smear
from
the
child.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
vaginal
smear
was
examined
by
the
state
department
and
the
hair
was
discovered
by
the
state
department.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
when
the
accused
was
taken
into
custody,
one
of
the
--
virtually,
the
first
act
the
police
did
was
to
take
a
pubic
hair
from
him
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
--
for
comparative
purposes.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
at
that
point,
they
recognized
with
the
size
of
significance
of
the
hair
in
the
vial.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
were
compared
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
--
and
found
to
be
a
mismatch.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
so
reported.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
was
sent
to
the
prosecution.
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecution,
the
facts
that
were
known
to
the
prosecution
and
that
is
what
i
meant
to
be
saying
is
the
report
that
was
suppressed.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
was
--
the
hair
in
the
container
was
not
identified
in
the
report
as
a
pubic
hair.
in
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice
warren
a
moment
ago,
i
said
that
i
thought
the
probability
was
high
that
it
was
a
pubic
hair
because
pubic
hairs
are
known
to
have
different
characteristics
from
hairs
of
--
from
other
parts
of
the
body.
however,
the
report
does
not
say
that.
it
does
state
that
the
hair
of
the
accused
which
was
compared
was
a
pubic
hair
and
therefore
it
was
found
to
be
a
mismatch.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
sir
is
exactly
my
point.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
was
vigorously
contested
as
having
been
coerced.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
obviously
does
not
meet
miranda
standards
but
i'm
not
arguing
that
point.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
defendant
did
testify
both
in
chambers,
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
before
the
jury.the
defendant
denied
--
at
that
point,
he
has
denied
consistently
from
that
moment
that
he
had
ever
confessed.
he
is
claiming
that
the
paper
he
signed,
he
didn't
know
what
the
paper
was
that
it
was
a
--
he
was
coaxed
into
signing
this
paper
in
order
to
avoid
going
to
the
electric
chair
after
52
hours
of
interrogation.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
all
52
hours
involved
interrogation
after
52
hours
of
detention.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
he
testified
at
that
time
and
the
episode
is
somewhat
garbled.
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
it
because
it
was
never
known
until
eight
years
later
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
the
state
report
existed,
exonerating
report
existed.
at
that
time,
he
testified
that
somewhere
during
the
52
hours
of
detention,
he
was
somehow
told
that
hair
has
incriminated
him.
that's
all
it
appears
that
that
hair
is
somehow
incriminated
him.
it
does
not
appear
that
it
was
told
that
a
hair
was
in
the
child's
vagina.
he
was
simply
told
that
the
hair
has
incriminated
him.
he
asked,
he
jumped
to
the
microscope
himself
and
said
let
me
look
and
“them
hairs
don't
match”.
this
is
his
testimony
at
the
trial
in
the
trial
record
and
it's
all
we
know
about
the
hair
episode.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
did
not
respond
to
it.
it
did
not
respond
to
it
any
way.
it
was
not
counted.
when
--
i
might
say
this
mr.
chief
justice,
when
the
accused
counsel
were
permitted
to
look
at
the
state's
evidence,
there
were
hair,
hairs
were
among
the
evidence
exhibited
to
them
but
no
--
not
the
report
just
for
hairs
as
evidence
that
the
state
would
rely
upon,
so
as
counsel
would
be
jumped
or
they
form
the
opinion
if
the
hairs
were
somehow
favorable
to
the
state.
hairs
were
among
the
evidence
exhibited
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
some
point
before
the
--
at
some
point
before
the
trial.
not
the
report.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
did
not
have
an
opportunity.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
asked.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
at
that
--
i
don't
--
all
that
appears
in
the
record
is
that
they
ask
several
times.
how
many
times?
we
don't
know.
the
prosecutor
testified
for
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
they
asked
continuously.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
asked
for
permission
to
examine
the
physical
evidence,
the
point
that
mr.
lassers
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
were
permitted
to
look
at
it.
look
--
simply
to
look
at
it.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
i
don't
know.
they
were
just
permitted
to
look
at
it.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
or
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
don't
know.
the
record
is
silent
at
it.
so
i
simply
don't
know.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
or
it
was
just
--
or
it
was
just
open
to
their
examination
and
--
at
some
place
or
some
point.
mr.
lassers
tells
me,
in
the
presence
of
the
sheriff,
they
were
permitted
to
see
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
none
of
these
things
were
surrendered
to
them.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that's
--
if
this
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
so
the
district
court
but
all
things
there
were
made
available
for
scientific
--
for
examination
by
the
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
by
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
was
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
was
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
it
was
at
the
hearing
on
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
in
which
he
was
recounting
chronologically
what
happened
to
him
during
the
52-hour
incommunicado
detention
period.
now,
the
treatment
of
this
point
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
does
not
show.
the
report
certainly
was
not,
the
exonerating
report.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
offered
no
hairs
as
part
of
their
case.
now,
the
attorney
general
in
response
to
all
of
these
about
the
hair
offers
two
points.
one
point
is
a
formal
one
that
no
request
was
made
by
the
accused
counsel
of
--
for
the
evidence
we
claim
was
suppressed.
this,
we
are
submitting
to
your
honors,
that
the
brady
against
maryland
cannot
be
read
as
requiring
such
a
request
and
we
have
cited
the
case,
u.s.
versus
wilkins
decided
by
judge
thurgood
marshall
which
reviews
all
the
authorities
on
this.
incidentally,
this
point
was
very
similar
to
the
point
that
bothered
the
court
before
the
jencks
case.
it
was
very
much
the
same
point
that
a
report
was
available
to
contradict
and
the
question
was
raised
and
the
point
was
made
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
the
jencks
case
that
how
could
anyone
be
expected
to
know
the
contents
of
report
they
hadn't
seen.
the
other
point
that
the
attorney
general
makes
is
that
the
accused
himself
somehow
knew
because
of
this
colloquy
that
took
place
during
the
52-hour
detention
period.
note,
the
attorney
general
is
in
the
awkward
position
of
claiming
that
the
accused
--
a
statement
they
made
to
the
accused
that
hairs
matched
is
to
be
treated
as
fulfillment
of
their
obligation
under
the
constitution
to
disclose
that
the
hairs
did
not
match.
now,
there
was
no
disclosure
at
all
that
the
hair
within
the
child's
vagina
didn't
match
the
accused
hair.
there
was
simply
some
general
garble
conversation
during
this
long
detention
period
about
hairs.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
he's
been
in
the
death
house
ten
years.
he's
approximately
30
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
his
conviction.
he's
40
years
here
of
age.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
never
so
identified,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that's
just
what
i'm
saying
yes
sir.
now,
an
electrocution
for
this
man
was
averted
six
hours
before
it
was
to
occur
only
as
a
result
of
the
intervention
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
case.
the
district
court
reached
the
correct
result
perhaps
for
wrong
reasons.
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
wrong
result
for
clearly
wrong
reasons.
and
we
ask
this
court
to
reach
the
right
result
for
the
right
reason.
i
thank
you.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
assume
that
they
--
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
question
your
honor
is
that
they
were
given
the
right
to
view
all
the
physical
evidence
in
the
case.
he
made
that
motion.
they
were
allowed
to
go
in.
they
were
allowed
to
view
all
the
physical
evidence
in
the
case.
now,
they
could've
based
--
the
hair
was
seen
of
record
that
they
saw
the
hairs
when
they
made
that
view.
a
motion
--
in
addition
of
the
fact,
that
the
defense
knew
that
the
hair
was
found
in
the
vagina
of
the
victim,
knew
that
hair
of
petitioner
was
taken
for
comparison
purposes.
i
do
not
submit
that
it
is
too
great
a
burden
on
the
prosecution
--
on
the
defense.
i
beg
your
pardon,
to
make
a
motion
for
their
result
of
that
examination.
