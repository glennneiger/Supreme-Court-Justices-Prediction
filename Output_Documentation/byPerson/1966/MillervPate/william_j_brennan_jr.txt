justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
specifically
what
evidence?
what
--
what
evidence
did
he
want
physically
to
examine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
vial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
just
wondered
whether
the
motion
referred
to
anything
specific
or
just
generally
asked
permission
to
examine
all
physical
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
hair
was
in
the
vial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
vial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
that
mean?
allowed
physically
to
view
--
what's
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
that
different
from
what
they
sought
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
did
they
see
this
after
the
motion
was
denied
but
before
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
vial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
did
the
--
the
police
concede
that
they
had
shown
him
a
hair
during
the
period
that
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
denial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
concession
that
it
was
shown?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
when
was
it
--
how
long
after
this
was
--
that
was
determined
that
in
fact
this
was
not
a
hair
from
his
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
eight
years
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
did
the
police
first
know
that
it
was
not
a
hair
from
his
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
at
the
time
he
was
shown
the
hair
and
told
that
it
was
from
his
body,
the
police
knew
that
in
fact
it
was
not
from
his
body.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is,
how
do
we
know
that
police
knew
that
it
was
not
from
his
body
at
the
time
they
told
him
it
was?
what
in
the
record
shows
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
there
but
i'm
still
uncertain
how
it
is
they
knew
it
was
not
his.
when
was
it
determined
and
by
whom
was
it
determined
that
it
was
not
a
hair
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
from
his
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
in
the
crime
laboratory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
which
he
stated
that
it
was
not
a
hair
from
his
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
when
was
that
report
prepared?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
long
--
on
what
dates
was
the
interrogation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
prior
to
the
date
of
that
report
in
any
event?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
how
do
you
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
between
the
28th
and
30th
that
it
had
been
discovered
it
was
not
a
hair
from
his
body
and
the
interrogating
officers
knew
it?
how
do
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
one
last
on
that
question.
did
these
lawyers
testify
at
the
least
the
post-conviction
or
other
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
--
did
they
testify
that
the
motion
itself
didn't
say
anything
about
it?
what
it
was
--
they
had
in
mind
when
they
made
the
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
they
certainly
didn't
say
they
had
in
mind
they
wanted
an
examination
of
the
hair,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
when
does
he
have
counsel
for
the
first
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
before
he
signed
the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
--
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
(voice
overlap)
refused
to
let
him
see
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
lawyer
tried
to
see
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
was
not
--
none
of
these
things
was
surrendered
to
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
i'm
not
sure
yet
about
this
testimony
in
the
accused
himself
about
the
hairs
and
he's
looking
into
the
microscope
and
so
forth
that
this
--
was
that
testimony
the
testimony
that
he
gave
at
the
trial
in
connection
with
the
challenge
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
that
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
whether
the
hairs
themselves
were
in
the
courtroom
on
the
occasion
of
that
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
i
gather
when
--
after
the
confession
was
admitted,
the
state
as
part
of
its
case,
i
think
you've
already
told
us,
offered
no
hairs
as
exhibit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
saying
is
that
whatever
the
hairs
were
that
he
saw
during
was
52
hours,
were
never
identified
by
the
prosecution
as
one
of
them
being
a
hair
from
the
child.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
that
happen
in
the
stated
--
did
that
happen
during
the
52
hour
detention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
can
take
that
as
true,
that's
what
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
he
also
say
that,
might
be,
they
said
that,
in
the
record,
state
officials
told
him
during
that
period
that
they
had
hairs
which
proved
his
guilt
as
to
that
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
that
they
showed
him
any
as
noted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
did
raise
it
at
trial.
you
concede
now
that
he
has
--
that
we
have
to
take
it
if
they
did
tell
him
these
hairs
were
his
when
at
the
time
they
were
interrogating
him
before
he
signed
his
confession.
although
they
knew
then
that
at
least
the
one
that
was
found
on
the
child's
vagina
was
not
his,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
suppose
it
would've
affected
the
outcome
of
that
trial?
if
the
defense
has
had
evidence
that
there
has
been
found
in
the
child
a
hair
and
that
it
was
not
the
hair
of
the
accused,
if
that
evidence
has
been
before
the
jury,
do
you
suppose
it
might
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
term?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
test
and
on
a
few
is
whether
it
would
affect
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
affect
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
please
answer
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
or
don't
consider
it
significant
that
there
was
in
brady
and
maryland
in
fact
they
request?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
submit
your
honor
that
it
was
too
broad
to
meet
the
requirements
of
brady
versus
maryland.
all
it
said
in
the
request
itself
your
honor
is
found
at
page
2
of
the
volume
4
of
the
record.
now,
comes
the
defendant,
lloyd
eldon
miller,
by
william
malmgren,
his
attorney,
hereby
moves
the
court
to
make
an
order
permitting
the
defendant
to
make,
or
cause
to
be
made,
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
as
the
court
may
seem
necessary
to
adequately
insure
the
interests
of
the
parties,
a
scientific
examination
of
the
physical
evidence
to
be
introduced
by
the
people
in
this
cause,
etcetera.
now,
even
under
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
your
honor,
in
order
to
make
a
--
for
the
defendant
to
make
a
motion
to
examine
physical
evidence
in
the
hands
of
the
government,
it
is
necessary
that
they
show
the
materiality
and
the
reasonableness.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
motion
would
not
be
--
would
be
held
as
improper
under
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
mr.
michael
that
among
the
things
they
did
see
was
the
actual
hair
taken
from
the
shorts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
identify
them
as
including
that
the
hair
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
hair
was
in
the
vial,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
they
made
the
motion
for
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
the
one
that
was
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
original
motion
granted
is
that
it
for
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
knew
that
at
the
time
that
the
shorts
was
introduced
in
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
didn't
disclose
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
whether
in
summation
he
used
the
garment
in
his
summation
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
the
time
he
made
reference
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
knew
that
there
was
--
that
at
least
all
of
the
spots
were
not
blood
but
some
or
something
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
said
nothing
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
michaels,
who
was
mr.
litterly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
statement
on
his
testimony
at
581.
“now
as
to
those
spots
which
you
knew
were
not
blood,
what
did
you
know
those
to
be?
what
did
you
know
of
those
mr.
ramsey?”
“i'm
trying
to
recollect
that.
they
said
there
was
also
paint
on
that
i
think
that
is
remembered
only.”
“who
said
it
was
paint?”
“i
presume
mr.
litterly
but
i
really
do
not
recall.”
is
that
--
are
we
to
get
--
take
from
this
that
he's
suggesting
that
at
the
time
it
was
offered
at
trial,
he
knew
more
of
then
that
there
were
some
spots
were
not
blood,
he
knew
that
there
were
spots
that
were
paint,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
not
the
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
habeas
corpus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reproduction
is
not
very
good.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
read
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
that
--
he
made
more
--
testify?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
more
fully
did
he,
on
the
habeas
corpus?
where
was
it
that
he
finally
conceded
that
some
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
thing
i
referred
to
in
form
of
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
michaels
as
you
held
those
up,
i
don't
--
it
hardly
seems
an
unspotted
--
look
at
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
blood
has
now
disappeared,
there's
certainly
an
awful
lot
of
paint.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry
must
have
read
them
--
perhaps
i
read
it
too
quickly.
this
is
the
confession
at
page
145?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
147,
can
you
refer
me
to
the
admission
that
these
particular
shorts
were
his?
i
see
that
there
is
--
he
states
that
he
removed
the
shorts,
but
i
don't
find
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
find
it
in
the
confession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
have
that
citation
recorded?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
one
they
could
not
have
known,
but
when
they
went
there
to
find
the
jacket
it
was
found
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
where
he
said
he
put
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
specifically
what
evidence?
what
--
what
evidence
did
he
want
physically
to
examine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
vial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
just
wondered
whether
the
motion
referred
to
anything
specific
or
just
generally
asked
permission
to
examine
all
physical
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
hair
was
in
the
vial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
vial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
that
mean?
allowed
physically
to
view
--
what's
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
that
different
from
what
they
sought
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
did
they
see
this
after
the
motion
was
denied
but
before
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
vial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
did
the
--
the
police
concede
that
they
had
shown
him
a
hair
during
the
period
that
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
denial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there's
no
concession
that
it
was
shown?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
when
was
it
--
how
long
after
this
was
--
that
was
determined
that
in
fact
this
was
not
a
hair
from
his
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
eight
years
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
did
the
police
first
know
that
it
was
not
a
hair
from
his
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
at
the
time
he
was
shown
the
hair
and
told
that
it
was
from
his
body,
the
police
knew
that
in
fact
it
was
not
from
his
body.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is,
how
do
we
know
that
police
knew
that
it
was
not
from
his
body
at
the
time
they
told
him
it
was?
what
in
the
record
shows
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
there
but
i'm
still
uncertain
how
it
is
they
knew
it
was
not
his.
when
was
it
determined
and
by
whom
was
it
determined
that
it
was
not
a
hair
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
from
his
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
in
the
crime
laboratory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
which
he
stated
that
it
was
not
a
hair
from
his
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
when
was
that
report
prepared?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
how
long

on
what

was
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
--
did
they
testify
that
the
motion
itself
didn't
say
anything
about
it?
what
it
was
--
they
had
in
mind
when
they
made
the
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
they
certainly
didn't
say
they
had
in
mind
they
wanted
an
examination
of
the
hair,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
when
does
he
have
counsel
for
the
first
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
before
he
signed
the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
--
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
(voice
overlap)
refused
to
let
him
see
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
lawyer
tried
to
see
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
was
not
--
none
of
these
things
was
surrendered
to
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
i'm
not
sure
yet
about
this
testimony
in
the
accused
himself
about
the
hairs
and
he's
looking
into
the
microscope
and
so
forth
that
this
--
was
that
testimony
the
testimony
that
he
gave
at
the
trial
in
connection
with
the
challenge
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
that
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
whether
the
hairs
themselves
were
in
the
courtroom
on
the
occasion
of
that
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
i
gather
when
--
after
the
confession
was
admitted,
the
state
as
part
of
its
case,
i
think
you've
already
told
us,
offered
no
hairs
as
exhibit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
saying
is
that
whatever
the
hairs
were
that
he
saw
during
was
52
hours,
were
never
identified
by
the
prosecution
as
one
of
them
being
a
hair
from
the
child.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
that
happen
in
the
stated
--
did
that
happen
during
the
52
hour
detention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
can
take
that
as
true,
that's
what
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
he
also
say
that,
might
be,
they
said
that,
in
the
record,
state
officials
told
him
during
that
period
that
they
had
hairs
which
proved
his
guilt
as
to
that
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
that
they
showed
him
any
as
noted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
did
raise
it
at
trial.
you
concede
now
that
he
has
--
that
we
have
to
take
it
if
they
did
tell
him
these
hairs
were
his
when
at
the
time
they
were
interrogating
him
before
he
signed
his
confession.
although
they
knew
then
that
at
least
the
one
that
was
found
on
the
child's
vagina
was
not
his,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
suppose
it
would've
affected
the
outcome
of
that
trial?
if
the
defense
has
had
evidence
that
there
has
been
found
in
the
child
a
hair
and
that
it
was
not
the
hair
of
the
accused,
if
that
evidence
has
been
before
the
jury,
do
you
suppose
it
might
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
term?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
test
and
on
a
few
is
whether
it
would
affect
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
affect
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
please
answer
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
or
don't
consider
it
significant
that
there
was
in
brady
and
maryland
in
fact
they
request?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
submit
your
honor
that
it
was
too
broad
to
meet
the
requirements
of
brady
versus
maryland.
all
it
said
in
the
request
itself
your
honor
is
found
at
page
2
of
the
volume
4
of
the
record.
now,
comes
the
defendant,
lloyd
eldon
miller,
by
william
malmgren,
his
attorney,
hereby
moves
the
court
to
make
an
order
permitting
the
defendant
to
make,
or
cause
to
be
made,
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
as
the
court
may
seem
necessary
to
adequately
insure
the
interests
of
the
parties,
a
scientific
examination
of
the
physical
evidence
to
be
introduced
by
the
people
in
this
cause,
etcetera.
now,
even
under
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
your
honor,
in
order
to
make
a
--
for
the
defendant
to
make
a
motion
to
examine
physical
evidence
in
the
hands
of
the
government,
it
is
necessary
that
they
show
the
materiality
and
the
reasonableness.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
motion
would
not
be
--
would
be
held
as
improper
under
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
mr.
michael
that
among
the
things
they
did
see
was
the
actual
hair
taken
from
the
shorts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
identify
them
as
including
that
the
hair
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
hair
was
in
the
vial,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
they
made
the
motion
for
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
the
one
that
was
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
original
motion
granted
is
that
it
for
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
knew
that
at
the
time
that
the
shorts
was
introduced
in
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
didn't
disclose
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
whether
in
summation
he
used
the
garment
in
his
summation
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
the
time
he
made
reference
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
knew
that
there
was
--
that
at
least
all
of
the
spots
were
not
blood
but
some
or
something
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
said
nothing
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
michaels,
who
was
mr.
litterly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
statement
on
his
testimony
at
581.
“now
as
to
those
spots
which
you
knew
were
not
blood,
what
did
you
know
those
to
be?
what
did
you
know
of
those
mr.
ramsey?”
“i'm
trying
to
recollect
that.
they
said
there
was
also
paint
on
that
i
think
that
is
remembered
only.”
“who
said
it
was
paint?”
“i
presume
mr.
litterly
but
i
really
do
not
recall.”
is
that
--
are
we
to
get
--
take
from
this
that
he's
suggesting
that
at
the
time
it
was
offered
at
trial,
he
knew
more
of
then
that
there
were
some
spots
were
not
blood,
he
knew
that
there
were
spots
that
were
paint,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
not
the
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
habeas
corpus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reproduction
is
not
very
good.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
read
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
that
--
he
made
more
--
testify?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
more
fully
did
he,
on
the
habeas
corpus?
where
was
it
that
he
finally
conceded
that
some
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
thing
i
referred
to
in
form
of
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
michaels
as
you
held
those
up,
i
don't
--
it
hardly
seems
an
unspotted
--
look
at
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
blood
has
now
disappeared,
there's
certainly
an
awful
lot
of
paint.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry
must
have
read
them
--
perhaps
i
read
it
too
quickly.
this
is
the
confession
at
page
145?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
147,
can
you
refer
me
to
the
admission
that
these
particular
shorts
were
his?
i
see
that
there
is
--
he
states
that
he
removed
the
shorts,
but
i
don't
find
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
find
it
in
the
confession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
have
that
citation
recorded?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
one
they
could
not
have
known,
but
when
they
went
there
to
find
the
jacket
it
was
found
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
where
he
said
he
put
it.
