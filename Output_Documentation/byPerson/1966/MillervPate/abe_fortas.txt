justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
this
branch
of
your
case,
are
you
making
two
points
--
one
that
the
police
used
the
hair
to
get
the
confession
and
that
that
was
error?
justice
abe
fortas
and
two
that
there
was
error
before
the
prosecution
to
fail
to
advice
the
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
the
petitioner
that
their
expert
had
reported
that
the
hairs
were
the
same?
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
not
the
same?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
have
those
two
points?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
didn't
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
at
the
original
trial
in
1956
see
those
shorts?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
did
he
do
after
he
saw
them?
justice
abe
fortas
did
he
have
an
analysis
made
of
them?
did
he
ask
--?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
he
moved
the
court
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made?
did
he
move
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
he
move
--
did
he
move
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
have
an
expert
examine
the
shorts?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
was
denied?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
had
he
had
an
opportunity
and
have
such
scientific
examination
made
prior
to
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
and
that
was
denied
in
may.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
your
point
about
the
subsequent
district
court
hearing
in
1961
or
whenever
it
was.
justice
abe
fortas
'63.
is
merely
that
it's
a
dramatic
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
prejudicial
error.
justice
abe
fortas
your
--
your
position
is
a
little
different
in
that,
isn't
it?
that
is
to
say
that
there
was
a
written
report
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
by
a
state
scientist
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
was
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecution
at
the
time,
before
the
trial
and
at
the
time
of
trial,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
said
that
there
was
a
plastic
container
which
contained
two
pubic
hairs,
one
from
the
girl
and
the
other
that
was
found.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
and
the
report
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
those
two
hairs
were
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
by
the
state.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
state
--
the
state
scientist
who
examined
this
so
reported.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
his
written
report
so
stated
that
it
was
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecution
before
trial
and
at
the
time
of
trial,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
did
the
--
yes,
i
see.
the
hair
that
was
in
this
plastic
container
or
rather
in
the
vaginal
smear,
was
that
identified
as
a
pubic
hair
in
the
written
report?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
point,
very
simply
stated
is
that
whatever
the
inference
may
or
may
not
be
that
this
is
relevant
and
of
great
importance
as
part
of
the
trial
and
that
the
prosecution
had
a
duty
to
advice
a
defense
in
its
existence.
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
testimony
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
was
a
couple
of
days
after
his
arrest,
was
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
he's
arrested
on
the
28th
and
on
the
30th
according
to
his
testimony
anyway,
he
was
confronted
with
these
hairs.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
date
of
the
confession?
justice
abe
fortas
did
he
testify
before
the
jury
on
--
just
on
the
confession
in
which
your
illinois
procedure.
was
that
sworn
testimony?
justice
abe
fortas
before
the
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
sworn
testimony.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
michael,
as
i
understand
it,
you
do
not
now
represent
to
this
court
that
the
hair
which
was
found
in
the
vaginal
smear
was
not
pubic
hair.
you
don't
make
that
representation
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
concede
the
contrary.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
do
not
here
contend
that
it
was
not
pubic
hair?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
you.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
michael,
may
i
ask
you
questions?
suppose
that
the
report,
i'm
trying
to
get
the
state's
position
now,
suppose
at
the
written
report
in
the
hands
of
the
state
were
to
the
effect
that
the
--
in
the
smear,
there
was
found
a
hair,
that
is
a
pubic
hair,
you
think
that
it
was
found
in
the
little
girl,
and
that
the
pubic
hair
that
was
found
there
did
not
match
the
pubic
hair
of
the
defendant.
let's
suppose
in
other
words
that
these
were
--
this
sort
of
overwhelmingly
exonerating
report.
in
your
--
in
the
state's
position,
would
the
state
be
obligated
to
disclose
that
to
the
defense?
i
think
perhaps
from
my
point
of
view
that
may
be
close
to
the
knob
of
our
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
maybe
there
are
some
limits
to
looking
upon
a
capital
case
which
the
state
demands
a
man's
life
and
there
are
some
limits
to
looking
upon
it
as
solely
upon
test
of
wits
and
abilities.
and
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
what
state's
position
is
on
the
assumption
that
i
stated.that
is
say
let's
suppose
if
this
were
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
regular
court
where
totally
exonerating
and
let's
suppose
that
the
defense,
because
of
negligence
or
stupidity
or
whatever,
did
not
demand
the
production
of
the
report
or
because
they
didn't
know
of
its
existence,
which
i
take
it,
is
a
fact
here,
did
not
demand
the
production
of
it.
do
you
think
that
the
state
would
be
justified
as
a
constitutional
matter
in
not
volunteering
that
information?
justice
abe
fortas
that
of
course
is
not
my
question,
but
that's
alright,
go
ahead
now.
justice
abe
fortas
what
they're
asking
here
was
for
the
physical
evidence
that
it
is
going
to
be
introduced
by
the
people
in
this
cause.
and
presumably
that
means
that
will
give
the
state
latitude
to
say,
“alright,
we're
going
to
have
to
use
this,
this
and
this
and
you
can
get
it
and
make
physical
examination
of
it.”
so
what's
the
deficiency
under
rule
16
or
otherwise?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
it
does
apply
to
this
part
of
the
case
involving
the
shorts.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
michael,
when
the
shorts
were
introduced
at
the
trial,
did
the
defense
make
a
motion
at
that
time
that
they
be
permitted
to
have
a
scientific
examination
of
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
try
to
get
at
the
theory
of
this
case.
suppose
at
the
trial,
the
state
offers
the
shorts
and
testimony
is
to
be
offered
or
is
being
or
has
been
offered
to
the
effect
that
those
are
blood
stains.
the
defense
then
moves
in
an
appropriate
way
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
have
a
scientific
examination
of
the
shorts.
in
illinois
law,
what
would
happen?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
trial
judge
said
in
all
this,
“no,
i
won't
let
you
do
that.”
would
that
be
an
error
under
illinois
law?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
there
was
discretion
on
it?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
it
would
be
introduced
as
discretion?
justice
abe
fortas
why,
because
it's
a
denial
of
fair
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
well
why,
that's
constitutional
principle
too,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
prosecutor
had
expressly
represented
to
the
jury
that
all
of
those
spots
were
blood,
would
that
have
been
your
judgment,
would
that
have
been
error
under
illinois
law?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
because
it
would've
not
been
consummate
with
our
ideas
of
a
fair
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
variation
in
the
sense
that
there
was
represented
but
there
was
blood
on
the
shorts
with
no
particularization
of
the
exhibit,
which
was
physically
before
the
jury.
it
was
not
all
blood
but
mostly
paint
as
to
the
appearance
to
the
naked
eye
now.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
this
branch
of
your
case,
are
you
making
two
points

one
that

were
the

justice
abe

not

you
have

yes,

you

he

did
he
move
--

did
he
move

did
he
move
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
have
an
expert
examine

justice

fortas

that
was

fortas

had
he
