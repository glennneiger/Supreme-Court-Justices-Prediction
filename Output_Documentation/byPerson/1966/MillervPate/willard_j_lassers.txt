mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
a
capital
case
that
comes
to
this
court
on
habeas
corpus.
relief
was
granted
by
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
judge
perry,
the
state
took
an
appeal
and
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
there
are
four
principal
errors
that
we
contend
occurred
in
this
trial
and
i'm
going
to
try
cover
the
four.
the
case
is
unique,
your
honors,
and
that
the
covenants
on
exonerating
this
petitioner
of
the
crime
was
discovered
even
before
the
petitioner
himself
was
arrested.
the
--
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
murder
and
on
saturday
afternoon,
november
26th,
1955
in
canton,
illinois
at
4:00
in
the
afternoon
and
a
little
eight
year
old
girl
was
found
under
a
mining
car
severely
injured
but
still
living.
she
was
rushed
to
a
hospital
where
she
dies
at
5:47
p.m.
that
afternoon.
at
6:20,
while
the
body
was
still
on
the
operating
table,
the
coroner
arrived
and
he
performed
an
examination.
now,
the
coroner
himself
was
a
physician.
in
the
course
of
that
examination,
he
took
a
vaginal
smear
and
there
had
been
a
sex
attack
on
this
child
and
he
took
the
smear
and
the
vaginal
smear
was
sealed
in
a
vial
with
a
surgical
tape
and
this
smear
together
with
a
mass
of
other
evidence
was
immediately
taken
to
springfield
which
was
few
miles
away
and
it
was
taken
to
the
state
crime
laboratory
there.
when
it
arrived
there,
the
man
in-charge,
a
man
by
the
name
of
forest
literally,
had
found
the
vial
and
it
was
still
sealed
and
it
had
on
it
janice
may,
the
name
of
the
victim
and
the
date
of
the
crime
november
26th,
1955
and
the
initials
of
the
coroner.
he
opened
the
vial
and
inside
was
a
tissue
which
he
examined.
and
when
he
made
a
close
examination,
he
found
that
there
was
a
single
strand
of
hair
that
was
adhering
to
the
tissue.
the
petitioner
lloyd
eldon
miller
was
arrested
the
following
day
on
november
the
29th,
at
about
six
o'clock
--
no
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening,
on
a
monday.
the
crime
took
place
on
saturday
and
he
was
arrested
on
monday.
he
was
immediately
taken
to
springfield
which
was
the
same
place
for
the
state
crime
laboratory
was
located
and
he
--
they
took
him
up
to
the
crime
laboratory
and
they
took
blood
sample
and
this
and
that
and
other
things
and
among
--
there
are
other
examinations,
they
took
a
sample
of
his
pubic
hairs.
and
immediately
after
that,
on
the
night
of
the
november
the
29th,
they
had
an
extensive
period
of
interrogation
which
lasted
i
believe
until
one
in
the
morning.
he
was
taken
back
to
his
cell
on
the
following
night,
the
night
of
the
30th,
there
was
another
extensive
period
of
examination
and
he
signed
a
confession
shortly
after
midnight
on
wednesday
evening
which
was
the
second
night
of
the
examination.
now,
he
was
tried
in
carthage
illinois,
in
september
of
1956
and
which
was
about
eight
months
--
ten
months
afterwards.
and
in
may,
which
was
several
months
before
the
--
before
the
trial,
the
--
his
then
defense
attorneys,
we
were
not
representing
him
at
the
time,
filed
a
motion
on
the
trial
court
asking,
i
believe,
to
make
a
physical
examination
of
the
evidence.
and
the
state
came
in
and
they
resisted
that,
and
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion,
and
they
preserved
the
error
in
the
record
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
affirmed
the
denial
of
the
right
to
make
a
physical
examination
of
the
evidence
and
the
--
they
affirmed
the
conviction.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
there
was
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
--
there
was
a
physical
evidence
that
was
later
introduced
to
the
trial.
i
don't
think
that
they
knew
themselves
exactly
what
physical
evidence
there
was.
but
there
were
various
--
there
was
a
--
that
there
was
a
pair
of
shorts
which
we
can
talk
about
later
on.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
believe
that
is
correct.
i
assume
that's
right.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
not
your
honor,
no.
now,
the
record
--
what?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
not
offered,
no,
no.
now,
the
petitioner
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
--
the
record
shows
that
the
--
that
the
physician
came
and
that
we
thought
the
vial
was
there
and
it
have
the
initials
of
the
coroner,
it
was
still
sealed,
with
the
name
of
the
child
and
the
date
of
the
crime,
and
that
this
was
then
sent
to
the
crime
laboratory,
and
that
is
the
extent
of
the
record.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
hair
was
on
--
was
adhering
to
a
tissue
in
the
vial
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
he
did
not.
he
have
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
justice
white,
we
think
that
the
inference
on
that
is
just
overwhelming.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
now,
the
--
it
is
also
a
fact
that
this
coroner
did
testify.
he
was
called
as
a
witness
by
the
prosecution
and
he
did
testify
and
he
said
that
when
he
arrived
there,
the
girl
was
dead
and
i
believe
he
said
that
she
was
still
on
the
operating
table.
now,
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
the
time
was
permitted
to
physically
to
view
the
physical
evidence
on
one
occasion
and
he
subsequently
testified
in
subsequent
proceedings.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
he
--
he
went
into
the
room
and
the
evidence
was
put
on
a
table
before
him
and
he
with
his
co-counsel
and
they
--
they
looked.
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
allowed
to
touch
or
not.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
what
they
sought
was
permission
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made
which
would
involve
bringing
in
specialists
in
various
kinds
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
after
they
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
saw
a
pair
of
short,
a
jacket,
and
a
rock,
and
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
think
they
saw
the
vial,
yes.
now,
it
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
record
shows
whether
it
was
or
it
was
not.
it
may
have
been.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
does
not
show
that
it
was
ever
called
to
their
attention.
however,
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
showing
a
hair
and
i
will
come
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
--
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
he
was
shown
a
hair.
during
the
course
of
his
interrogation
and
this
was
on
the
second
night
and
it
was
shortly
before
he
signed
a
confession,
he
testified
that
he
was
shown
a
hair,
that
he
was
taken
into
a
microscope
room
which
is
what
he
called
it,
and
that
he
was
told
that
one
of
his
hairs
matched
the
hair
from
the
little
--
that
was
found
in
the
little
girl
and
he
said
that
that
--
they
told
him
that
he
could
look
at
the
microscope
through
himself
and
then
he
said
that
he
informed
the
people
present
them
hairs
don't
match.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
them
hairs
don't
match.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
he
--
he
so
testified
at
the
--
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
admit
the
confession.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
there
was
no
denial
of
this.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
on
the
prosecution
side
assigned
on
that
issue.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it's
silent.
and
i
--
i
think
it's
a
fair
to
say
that
they
have
conceded,
that
they
showed
him
the
hair
and
that
they
told
him
that
the
hairs
matched.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
eight
years,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
eight
years,
yes
sir.
it
was
--
then,
what
happened
was
after
the
affirmance
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
at
the
very
latest,
on
december
the
7th
of
1955
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
--
which
was
--
and
we
think
it's
a
fair
inference
from
the
record
that
they
knew
it
the
very
afternoon
that
the
hair
was
delivered
to
the
crime
laboratory
which
was
a
day
or
two
after
the
crime.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
the
--
the
--
we
think
that
that
is
the
inescapable
inference
from
the
record.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
only
--
it's
only
the
inference
and
based
on
this
fact
that
the
hair
was
already
in
the
crime
laboratory
for
over
24
hours
at
the
time
they
made
the
false
statement
to
him.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
determined
by
his
fellow
literally
in
--
and
he
wrote
up
an
official
report
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
is
in
the
crime
laboratory
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
and
he
wrote
an
official
report,
one
copy
of
which
went
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
is
dated
december
the
7th,
1955.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
on
november
the
29th
and
november
the
30th.
and
the
hair
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
correct,
your
honor
and
it
was
--
the
hair
was
delivered
to
the
crime
laboratory
on
the
28th.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
all
we
can
say
on
that,
your
honor,
is
that
either
they
knew
it
or
that
they
made
a
statement
to
the
petitioner
with
this
regard
whether
it
was
true
or
false.
now,
we
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
knew
it
or
whether
they
--
they
told
it
to
him
without
making
the
determination.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes
sir.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
now,
of
course
they
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
doesn't
show
that
they
did
anything.
but
of
course
they
were
in
a
terrible
position
because
what
could
they
do
is
see
that
the
state
never
introduced
the
hair
at
the
trial.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
and
if
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
chief
justice,
all
they
had
was
what
this
uneducated
cab
driver
with
a
two-year
high
school
education
at
the
most
told
them,
he
told
the
investigating
authority
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct,
and
that
--
that
is
the
reason
that
they
made
the
--
the
request,
to
have
--
to
be
permitted
to
make
a
scientific
examination
of
the
evidence
and
that
was
denied.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
the
motion
does
not
state
that.
it
does
not,
no.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
does
not,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
they
did.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
believe
they
did
and
i
--
i'm
not
certain
about
that
but
i
don't
think
they
did.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
believe
they
did.
i
am
not
certain
of
what
of
state
of
the
record
is
on
that
point.
now,
the
--
then
the
--
then
the
next
step
was
there
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
relief
was
denied
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
was
held
up
by
the
other
counsel.
then,
we
came
to
august
of
1963
when
a
petition
for
commutation
was
filed
and
the
--
there
was
a
hearing
before
the
illinois
pardon
and
parole
board
and
in
the
course
of
that
hearing
there
was
certain
evidence
introduced
by
the
prosecution
and
by
the
defendants
which
--
which
for
the
first
time
cast
substantial
real
doubt
on
the
man's
guilt
and
the
--
we
were
then
about
two
days
before
the
execution,
the
execution
was
set
for
one
minute
after
midnight
on
august
the
23rd
and
the
commutation
was
denied
on
august
the
20th.
so
we
proceeded
in
two
channels.
one
was,
the
date
for
death
that
have
been
sent
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
was
not
been
in
session
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
his
parents
obtained
counsel
for
him
even
while
he
was
still
being
interrogated.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
that's
true.
the
counsel
never
saw
him
until
after
the
confession
was
signed.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
--
he
was
held
incommunicado.
he
asked
to
see
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct
and
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
his
lawyer
inquiries
to
get
to
see
him
and
i
believe
that
the
--
the
first
time
that
his
lawyers
saw
him
was
on
december
the
1st
which
was
the
morning
following
the
night
when
he
signed
the
confession.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
did
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
did
testify,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
--
there
was
nothing.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
mentioned
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
by
either
side,
that
is
correct.
yes,
i
believe
he
testified
that
the
injury
were
something
about
the
character.
so
that
was
the
--
we
made
an
application
to
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
vacation,
for
a
stay,
that
was
denied.
we
filed
a
second
application
for
habeas
corpus
which
was
the
time
when
the
present
group
of
attorneys
accepted
the
case
and
that
was
granted
by
judge
decker
and
then
the
matter
was
sat
down
for
a
full
hearing
before
judge
perry.
and
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
before
judge
perry,
the
--
we
produced
evidence
regarding
a
pair
of
jockey
shorts.
these
shorts
were
originally
introduced
with
the
1956
trial
and
at
that
time
it
was
evidence
from
mr.
litterly
that
i
mentioned
yesterday
that
these
shorts
have
type
a
blood
on
them
and
there
was
some
out
there
evidence
which
we
question
that
that
the
little
girl
who
was
murdered
also
had
type
a
blood
and
these
shorts
according
to
the
prosecution
theory
had
been
worn
by
the
petitioner
and
had
been
abandoned
by
him
in
his
flight.
we
pre
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
mother
was
--
testified
to
that
effect.
it
was
a
hearsay
testimony
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
but
it
got
into
the
record.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she
did.
the
mother
of
the
little
girl
testified,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
in
shape,
yes,
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she
didn't
say.
it
was
fudge.
it
appeared
as
though
she
was
based
at
a
school
record
tied
in
with
the
child's
weight.
but
she
made
the
statement
that
she
had
a
type
a
blood
and
that's
all
the
evidence
there
was
at
the
trial
as
to
the
little
girl's
blood
type.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
we
--
we
think
it
was
hearsay
evidence,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
positively
because
the
child
is
dead.
so
we
can't
verify
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
have
made
efforts
inconclusive.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i'm
sorry.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
we
made
various
inquiries
at
the
hospital
and
so
forth.
they
turned
up
some
slips
which
showed
type
a
blood
but
the
exact
timing
and
dates
and
it
was
very
confused.
we
couldn't
establish
it
either
way.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
remember
the
details
whether
the
slip
was
undated
or
what
the
problem
was
but
i
remember
that
we
couldn't
establish
it
either
way.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
--
it's
my
understanding
that
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
at
the
district
court
hearing,
for
the
first
time,
judge
perry
permitted
us
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made
of
the
shorts
and
at
that
time,
we
produced
evidence
showing
that
the
shorts
were
saturated
not
with
blood
but
they
were
saturated
with
paint.
now,
we've
actually
brought
up
the
shorts
up
here,
they
look
terrible
your
honors
and
they
--
all
what
you
see
here
is
paint
and
not
blood.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
cannot
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
no.
it
took
us
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
what?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
a
disputed
fact.
now,
our
chemist
testified
that
he
could
find
no
evidence
of
blood.
he
made
this
test
in
december
of
'63.
now,
there
was
testimony
back
in
'56
by
the
state
witness
litterly
that
he
found
blood
on
the
shorts.
but
our
man
couldn't
find
any
in
'63.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
state?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
state
didn't
make
any
new
test
in
'63
one
way
or
the
other.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
this
was
always
referred
to
at
the
1956
trial
as
the
blood
stained
shorts
even
petitioner
so
referred
to
it
and
litterly,
in
the
'56
testimony
said,
he
talked
about
--
he
said
that
the
red
--
the
staining
material
on
the
shorts
were
--
was
blood.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
certainly.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
have
not
challenged
that.
all
that
they
can
claim
was
that
there
was
--
that
their
testimony
--
that
their
expert
in
'56,
said
that
there
was
blood
but
i
think
it
is
undisputed
now
that
everything
that
your
honors
see
is
paint.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes
he
did,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
moved
the
court
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made
of
the
shorts
and
it
was
denied.
so
he
couldn't
present
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
presented
a
motion.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
denied.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
moved
it
in
may
that
it
was
an
examination
to
examine
all
the
physical
evidence,
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made.
it
was
made
in
may
and
the
trial
was
held
in
september.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
denied.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
'63.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no.
no,
mr.
justice
black,
it
was
not.
there
was
no
way
to
tell
as
i
understand
it
by
looking
at
this,
what
this
stating
material
is.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
made
a
motion
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made
of
all
of
the
physical
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
not
specified.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
--
of
all
the
physical
evidence.
it
was
not
specified
and
there
was
a
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
were
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecution
up
to
the
time
of
the
trial
and
then
they
were
in
the
--
i
believe
in
the
possession
of
the
trial
court.
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
and
then
they
were
transmitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
we
got
them
into
the
hands
of
the
district
court
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
then
they
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
they
came
to
this
court.
now,
the
--
there
are
two
other
errors
your
honors
that
we
feel
are
critical
here.
one
relates
to
the
state's
star
witness,
betty
baldwin
who
is
now
betty
baldwin-curry
who
testified
that
on
the
night
of
the
murder
that
this
--
that
the
petitioner
admitted
the
crime
to
her
in
the
course
of
a
taxi
ride,
he
was
a
taxi
driver
and
in
1963,
before
judge
perry,
she
recanted
her
testimony
and
denied
that
she
had
ever
--
that
he
had
ever
made
such
a
statement
to
her.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
--
no,
i
don't
believe
it
did.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
did?
mr.
rosenfield
says
that
it
does
make
such
a
reference.
now,
at
the
'63
trial,
again
by
discovery,
we
learned
for
the
first
time
of
a
statement
in
the
prosecution
files
given
by
this
woman
very
shortly
after
the
crime.
at
the
'56
trial,
she
was
asked
how
long
she
had
known
the
petitioner
and
her
answer
was
two
years.
and
at
the
19
--
and
the
statement
that
she
gave
to
the
prosecution
right
after
the
crime
was
that
she
had
known
him
for
five
weeks.
now,
that
was
first
learned
by
us
in
1963.
then
there
was
a
whole
long
list
of
other
facts
known
to
the
prosecution
prior
to
the
‘56
trial
which
cast
serious
doubt
on
the
reliability
and
trustworthiness
of
this
witness.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
because
if
she
had
known
him
for
two
years,
mr.
justice
black
then
if
she
conveyed
the
impression
--
conveyed
the
impression
to
the
jury
that
it
was
the
--
that
there
was
the
kind
of
relationship
between
them
that
if
he
had
committed
a
crime
that
he
would
admit
it
to
her
whereas
if
it
was
only
five
weeks,
it
would
be
less
likely
that
he
would
make
such
an
admission
to
somebody
that
he
had
just
knew
very
briefly.
now,
the
--
my
time
has
expired,
your
honors
and
i
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
we're
not
going
to
--
because
i
have
mentioned
that
i
don't
want
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
think
that
they're
unimportant
but
there
were
serious
questions
with
regard
to
being
cut
off
in
the
examination
of
a
key
defense
witness
mrs.
alice
baxter
who
is
the
landlady.
and
the
landlady
came
up
to
the
1963
trial
and
said
that
he
was
in
his
room
in
her
house
at
the
time
that
the
crime
took
place.
in
'56,
before
the
trial,
the
defense
counsel
tried
to
interview
this
witness.
she
spoke
to
him
once
or
twice
and
then
the
--
then
she
called
the
prosecution
and
the
prosecution
told
her
that
she
has
a
constitutional
right
not
to
talk
to
the
defense
counsel
and
then
she
refused
to
talk
to
him
any
further.
so
she
was
listed
as
a
prosecution
witness
in
1956.
she
was
not
called
by
the
defense
in
'63,
as
i
said,
she
came
forward
and
she
said
that
he
was
in
her
house
at
the
time
of
crime.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
intended
to
deal
with
that
your
honor
but
my
time
is
going
down
except
for
the
fact
that
there
was
a
lie
about
the
hair
plus
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
told
--
he
asked
to
see
his
parents
and
the
police
told
him,
“you
can't
see
your
parents.
your
parents
don't
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you.”
and
all
the
time
the
parents
were
out
trying
to
find
out
where
he
was
in
lining
up
an
attorney.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
the
fact,
your
honor
and
it
is
so
stated
in
the
record
and
in
fact
mr.
malmgren,
the
defense
counsel
said
i
will
not
state
that
she
is
unreliable.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
oh!
no,
no.
the
defense
counsel
would
refuse
to
say
that
she
was
unreliable.
his
point
was
that
he
didn't
know
what
her
testimony
was
going
to
be
and
he
couldn't
risk
being
bound
by
her
testimony.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no.
i
--
no.
i
would
say,
no.
but
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
record
that
say
that
they
put
in
an
affidavit
that
she
had
given
some
contrary
testimony
--
made
a
contrary
statement
to
a
prosecution
with
--
that
was
introduced
in
'63.
but
when
she
--
but
nobody
has
really
challenged
her
for
it.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
because
it
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
mr.
justice
black
because
it
cut
the
defense
off
not
only
from
this
live
witness.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
right.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
our
point
is
your
honor
that
it
was
wrong
for
the
prosecution
to
chill
the
defense
in
this
avenue
of
exploration.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
because
in
--
your
honor,
we
feel
that
in
a
murder
trial,
particularly,
that
the
defense
is
seriously
handicapped
if
the
prosecution
compel
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
right.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
your
honor,
no.
if
this
had
been
her
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
only
if
she
had
said
voluntarily
of
her
own
will,
“i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you”
then
perfectly
alright.
but
i
think
it
was
wrong
for
the
prosecution
to
say
to
her
to
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she
called
--
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
she
called
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
then
the
prosecuting
attorney
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
and
asked
him.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
not
to
testify
but
to
talk
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she's
--
he
said
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
said
that
to
her
and
to
some
certain
other
witnesses
and
the
prosecutor
so
testified
in
'63.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
the
point
is
that
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
complete
that
inquiry
that
then
she
would
have
been
available
as
a
witness.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
if
the
defense
counsel
had
been
allowed
to
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
we
feel
that
his
advice
was
wrong
that
she
had
a
constitutional
right
and
so
forth.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
if
it
was
up
to
her,
she
could
make
her
own
decision
but
the
prosecution
should
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
i
think
you
should
have
said
to
her
in
fairness
to
the
defense
that
you
go
ahead
--
he
asked
to
prepare
his
case.
i
think
that
would've
been
the
part
where
it
is.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
do
your
honor.
well,
we
might
mention
also
that
the
gregory
case
which
decided
recently
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
somewhat
similar
circumstances.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she
testified
in
1963.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
mr.
justice
white,
she
did
not.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
don't
know
what
they
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
put
in
their
own
evidence
on
that
point.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
put
in
evidence
saying
that
some
official
had
interviewed
her
and
she
had
told
them
--
given
them
a
different
story
but
she
testified
in
'63,
she
and
her
husband
and
the
two
grandchildren,
placing
him
in
the
house
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
don't
say
that
mr.
justice
white
because
that
was
just
a
hearsay
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
just
put
it
in
an
affidavit.
they
didn't
put
the
man
on
the
stand.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that's
their
claim,
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
think
it
does.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
everything
that
we
desire
to
say
has
been
said,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
certainly.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
your
honor.
my
recollection
is
that
we
did.
yes,
we
did
rely
on
that.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
ruled
that
it
was
not
coerced,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
think
they
did.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
in
this
court?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
oh,
yes!
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
thank
you.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
a
capital
case
that
comes
to
this
court
on
habeas
corpus.
relief
was
granted
by
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
judge
perry,
the
state
took
an
appeal
and
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
there
are
four
principal
errors
that
we
contend
occurred
in
this
trial
and
i'm
going
to
try
cover
the
four.
the
case
is
unique,
your
honors,
and
that
the
covenants
on
exonerating
this
petitioner
of
the
crime
was
discovered
even
before
the
petitioner
himself
was
arrested.
the
--
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
murder
and
on
saturday
afternoon,
november
26th,
1955
in
canton,
illinois
at
4:00
in
the
afternoon
and
a
little
eight
year
old
girl
was
found
under
a
mining
car
severely
injured
but
still
living.
she
was
rushed
to
a
hospital
where
she
dies
at
5:47
p.m.
that
afternoon.
at
6:20,
while
the
body
was
still
on
the
operating
table,
the
coroner
arrived
and
he
performed
an
examination.
now,
the
coroner
himself
was
a
physician.
in
the
course
of
that
examination,
he
took
a
vaginal
smear
and
there
had
been
a
sex
attack
on
this
child
and
he
took
the
smear
and
the
vaginal
smear
was
sealed
in
a
vial
with
a
surgical
tape
and
this
smear
together
with
a
mass
of
other
evidence
was
immediately
taken
to
springfield
which
was
few
miles
away
and
it
was
taken
to
the
state
crime
laboratory
there.
when
it
arrived
there,
the
man
in-charge,
a
man
by
the
name
of
forest
literally,
had
found
the
vial
and
it
was
still
sealed
and
it
had
on
it
janice
may,
the
name
of
the
victim
and
the
date
of
the
crime
november
26th,
1955
and
the
initials
of
the
coroner.
he
opened
the
vial
and
inside
was
a
tissue
which
he
examined.
and
when
he
made
a
close
examination,
he
found
that
there
was
a
single
strand
of
hair
that
was
adhering
to
the
tissue.
the
petitioner
lloyd
eldon
miller
was
arrested
the
following
day
on
november
the
29th,
at
about
six
o'clock
--
no
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening,
on
a
monday.
the
crime
took
place
on
saturday
and
he
was
arrested
on
monday.
he
was
immediately
taken
to
springfield
which
was
the
same
place
for
the
state
crime
laboratory
was
located
and
he
--
they
took
him
up
to
the
crime
laboratory
and
they
took
blood
sample
and
this
and
that
and
other
things
and
among
--
there
are
other
examinations,
they
took
a
sample
of
his
pubic
hairs.
and
immediately
after
that,
on
the
night
of
the
november
the
29th,
they
had
an
extensive
period
of
interrogation
which
lasted
i
believe
until
one
in
the
morning.
he
was
taken
back
to
his
cell
on
the
following
night,
the
night
of
the
30th,
there
was
another
extensive
period
of
examination
and
he
signed
a
confession
shortly
after
midnight
on
wednesday
evening
which
was
the
second
night
of
the
examination.
now,
he
was
tried
in
carthage
illinois,
in
september
of
1956
and
which
was
about
eight
months
--
ten
months
afterwards.
and
in
may,
which
was
several
months
before
the
--
before
the
trial,
the
--
his
then
defense
attorneys,
we
were
not
representing
him
at
the
time,
filed
a
motion
on
the
trial
court
asking,
i
believe,
to
make
a
physical
examination
of
the
evidence.
and
the
state
came
in
and
they
resisted
that,
and
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion,
and
they
preserved
the
error
in
the
record
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
affirmed
the
denial
of
the
right
to
make
a
physical
examination
of
the
evidence
and
the
--
they
affirmed
the
conviction.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
there
was
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
--
there
was
a
physical
evidence
that
was
later
introduced
to
the
trial.
i
don't
think
that
they
knew
themselves
exactly
what
physical
evidence
there
was.
but
there
were
various
--
there
was
a
--
that
there
was
a
pair
of
shorts
which
we
can
talk
about
later
on.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
believe
that
is
correct.
i
assume
that's
right.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
not
your
honor,
no.
now,
the
record
--
what?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
not
offered,
no,
no.
now,
the
petitioner
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
--
the
record
shows
that
the
--
that
the
physician
came
and
that
we
thought
the
vial
was
there
and
it
have
the
initials
of
the
coroner,
it
was
still
sealed,
with
the
name
of
the
child
and
the
date
of
the
crime,
and
that
this
was
then
sent
to
the
crime
laboratory,
and
that
is
the
extent
of
the
record.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
hair
was
on
--
was
adhering
to
a
tissue
in
the
vial
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
he
did
not.
he
have
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
justice
white,
we
think
that
the
inference
on
that
is
just
overwhelming.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
now,
the
--
it
is
also
a
fact
that
this
coroner
did
testify.
he
was
called
as
a
witness
by
the
prosecution
and
he
did
testify
and
he
said
that
when
he
arrived
there,
the
girl
was
dead
and
i
believe
he
said
that
she
was
still
on
the
operating
table.
now,
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
the
time
was
permitted
to
physically
to
view
the
physical
evidence
on
one
occasion
and
he
subsequently
testified
in
subsequent
proceedings.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
he
--
he
went
into
the
room
and
the
evidence
was
put
on
a
table
before
him
and
he
with
his
co-counsel
and
they
--
they
looked.
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
allowed
to
touch
or
not.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
what
they
sought
was
permission
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made
which
would
involve
bringing
in
specialists
in
various
kinds
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
after
they
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
saw
a
pair
of
short,
a
jacket,
and
a
rock,
and
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
think
they
saw
the
vial,
yes.
now,
it
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
record
shows
whether
it
was
or
it
was
not.
it
may
have
been.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
does
not
show
that
it
was
ever
called
to
their
attention.
however,
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
showing
a
hair
and
i
will
come
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
--
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
he
was
shown
a
hair.
during
the
course
of
his
interrogation
and
this
was
on
the
second
night
and
it
was
shortly
before
he
signed
a
confession,
he
testified
that
he
was
shown
a
hair,
that
he
was
taken
into
a
microscope
room
which
is
what
he
called
it,
and
that
he
was
told
that
one
of
his
hairs
matched
the
hair
from
the
little
--
that
was
found
in
the
little
girl
and
he
said
that
that
--
they
told
him
that
he
could
look
at
the
microscope
through
himself
and
then
he
said
that
he
informed
the
people
present
them
hairs
don't
match.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
them
hairs
don't
match.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
he
--
he
so
testified
at
the
--
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
admit
the
confession.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
there
was
no
denial
of
this.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
on
the
prosecution
side
assigned
on
that
issue.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it's
silent.
and
i
--
i
think
it's
a
fair
to
say
that
they
have
conceded,
that
they
showed
him
the
hair
and
that
they
told
him
that
the
hairs
matched.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
eight
years,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
eight
years,
yes
sir.
it
was
--
then,
what
happened
was
after
the
affirmance
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
at
the
very
latest,
on
december
the
7th
of
1955
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
--
which
was
--
and
we
think
it's
a
fair
inference
from
the
record
that
they
knew
it
the
very
afternoon
that
the
hair
was
delivered
to
the
crime
laboratory
which
was
a
day
or
two
after
the
crime.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
the
--
the
--
we
think
that
that
is
the
inescapable
inference
from
the
record.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
only
--
it's
only
the
inference
and
based
on
this
fact
that
the
hair
was
already
in
the
crime
laboratory
for
over
24
hours
at
the
time
they
made
the
false
statement
to
him.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
determined
by
his
fellow
literally
in
--
and
he
wrote
up
an
official
report
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
is
in
the
crime
laboratory
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
and
he
wrote
an
official
report,
one
copy
of
which
went
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
is
dated
december
the
7th,
1955.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
on
november
the
29th
and
november
the
30th.
and
the
hair
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
correct,
your
honor
and
it
was
--
the
hair
was
delivered
to
the
crime
laboratory
on
the
28th.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
all
we
can
say
on
that,
your
honor,
is
that
either
they
knew
it
or
that
they
made
a
statement
to
the
petitioner
with
this
regard
whether
it
was
true
or
false.
now,
we
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
knew
it
or
whether
they
--
they
told
it
to
him
without
making
the
determination.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes
sir.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
now,
of
course
they
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
record
doesn't
show
that
they
did
anything.
but
of
course
they
were
in
a
terrible
position
because
what
could
they
do
is
see
that
the
state
never
introduced
the
hair
at
the
trial.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
and
if
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
chief
justice,
all
they
had
was
what
this
uneducated
cab
driver
with
a
two-year
high
school
education
at
the
most
told
them,
he
told
the
investigating
authority
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct,
and
that
--
that
is
the
reason
that
they
made
the
--
the
request,
to
have
--
to
be
permitted
to
make
a
scientific
examination
of
the
evidence
and
that
was
denied.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
the
motion
does
not
state
that.
it
does
not,
no.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
does
not,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
they
did.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
believe
they
did
and
i
--
i'm
not
certain
about
that
but
i
don't
think
they
did.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
believe
they
did.
i
am
not
certain
of
what
of
state
of
the
record
is
on
that
point.
now,
the
--
then
the
--
then
the
next
step
was
there
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
relief
was
denied
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
was
held
up
by
the
other
counsel.
then,
we
came
to
august
of
1963
when
a
petition
for
commutation
was
filed
and
the
--
there
was
a
hearing
before
the
illinois
pardon
and
parole
board
and
in
the
course
of
that
hearing
there
was
certain
evidence
introduced
by
the
prosecution
and
by
the
defendants
which
--
which
for
the
first
time
cast
substantial
real
doubt
on
the
man's
guilt
and
the
--
we
were
then
about
two
days
before
the
execution,
the
execution
was
set
for
one
minute
after
midnight
on
august
the
23rd
and
the
commutation
was
denied
on
august
the
20th.
so
we
proceeded
in
two
channels.
one
was,
the
date
for
death
that
have
been
sent
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
was
not
been
in
session
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
his
parents
obtained
counsel
for
him
even
while
he
was
still
being
interrogated.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
that's
true.
the
counsel
never
saw
him
until
after
the
confession
was
signed.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
--
he
was
held
incommunicado.
he
asked
to
see
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct
and
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
his
lawyer
inquiries
to
get
to
see
him
and
i
believe
that
the
--
the
first
time
that
his
lawyers
saw
him
was
on
december
the
1st
which
was
the
morning
following
the
night
when
he
signed
the
confession.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
did
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
did
testify,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
--
there
was
nothing.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
mentioned
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
by
either
side,
that
is
correct.
yes,
i
believe
he
testified
that
the
injury
were
something
about
the
character.
so
that
was
the
--
we
made
an
application
to
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
vacation,
for
a
stay,
that
was
denied.
we
filed
a
second
application
for
habeas
corpus
which
was
the
time
when
the
present
group
of
attorneys
accepted
the
case
and
that
was
granted
by
judge
decker
and
then
the
matter
was
sat
down
for
a
full
hearing
before
judge
perry.
and
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
before
judge
perry,
the
--
we
produced
evidence
regarding
a
pair
of
jockey
shorts.
these
shorts
were
originally
introduced
with
the
1956
trial
and
at
that
time
it
was
evidence
from
mr.
litterly
that
i
mentioned
yesterday
that
these
shorts
have
type
a
blood
on
them
and
there
was
some
out
there
evidence
which
we
question
that
that
the
little
girl
who
was
murdered
also
had
type
a
blood
and
these
shorts
according
to
the
prosecution
theory
had
been
worn
by
the
petitioner
and
had
been
abandoned
by
him
in
his
flight.
we
pre
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
mother
was
--
testified
to
that
effect.
it
was
a
hearsay
testimony
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
but
it
got
into
the
record.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she
did.
the
mother
of
the
little
girl
testified,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
in
shape,
yes,
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she
didn't
say.
it
was
fudge.
it
appeared
as
though
she
was
based
at
a
school
record
tied
in
with
the
child's
weight.
but
she
made
the
statement
that
she
had
a
type
a
blood
and
that's
all
the
evidence
there
was
at
the
trial
as
to
the
little
girl's
blood
type.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
we
--
we
think
it
was
hearsay
evidence,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
positively
because
the
child
is
dead.
so
we
can't
verify
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
have
made
efforts
inconclusive.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i'm
sorry.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
we
made
various
inquiries
at
the
hospital
and
so
forth.
they
turned
up
some
slips
which
showed
type
a
blood
but
the
exact
timing
and
dates
and
it
was
very
confused.
we
couldn't
establish
it
either
way.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
remember
the
details
whether
the
slip
was
undated
or
what
the
problem
was
but
i
remember
that
we
couldn't
establish
it
either
way.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
--
it's
my
understanding
that
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
at
the
district
court
hearing,
for
the
first
time,
judge
perry
permitted
us
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made
of
the
shorts
and
at
that
time,
we
produced
evidence
showing
that
the
shorts
were
saturated
not
with
blood
but
they
were
saturated
with
paint.
now,
we've
actually
brought
up
the
shorts
up
here,
they
look
terrible
your
honors
and
they
--
all
what
you
see
here
is
paint
and
not
blood.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
cannot
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
no.
it
took
us
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
what?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
a
disputed
fact.
now,
our
chemist
testified
that
he
could
find
no
evidence
of
blood.
he
made
this
test
in
december
of
'63.
now,
there
was
testimony
back
in
'56
by
the
state
witness
litterly
that
he
found
blood
on
the
shorts.
but
our
man
couldn't
find
any
in
'63.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
state?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
the
state
didn't
make
any
new
test
in
'63
one
way
or
the
other.
now
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
this
was
always
referred
to
at
the
1956
trial
as
the
blood
stained
shorts
even
petitioner
so
referred
to
it
and
litterly,
in
the
'56
testimony
said,
he
talked
about
--
he
said
that
the
red
--
the
staining
material
on
the
shorts
were
--
was
blood.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
certainly.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
have
not
challenged
that.
all
that
they
can
claim
was
that
there
was
--
that
their
testimony
--
that
their
expert
in
'56,
said
that
there
was
blood
but
i
think
it
is
undisputed
now
that
everything
that
your
honors
see
is
paint.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes
he
did,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
moved
the
court
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made
of
the
shorts
and
it
was
denied.
so
he
couldn't
present
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
presented
a
motion.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
denied.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
moved
it
in
may
that
it
was
an
examination
to
examine
all
the
physical
evidence,
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made.
it
was
made
in
may
and
the
trial
was
held
in
september.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
denied.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
'63.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no.
no,
mr.
justice
black,
it
was
not.
there
was
no
way
to
tell
as
i
understand
it
by
looking
at
this,
what
this
stating
material
is.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
made
a
motion
to
have
a
scientific
examination
made
of
all
of
the
physical
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
not
specified.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was
--
of
all
the
physical
evidence.
it
was
not
specified
and
there
was
a
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
were
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecution
up
to
the
time
of
the
trial
and
then
they
were
in
the
--
i
believe
in
the
possession
of
the
trial
court.
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
and
then
they
were
transmitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
we
got
them
into
the
hands
of
the
district
court
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
then
they
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
they
came
to
this
court.
now,
the
--
there
are
two
other
errors
your
honors
that
we
feel
are
critical
here.
one
relates
to
the
state's
star
witness,
betty
baldwin
who
is
now
betty
baldwin-curry
who
testified
that
on
the
night
of
the
murder
that
this
--
that
the
petitioner
admitted
the
crime
to
her
in
the
course
of
a
taxi
ride,
he
was
a
taxi
driver
and
in
1963,
before
judge
perry,
she
recanted
her
testimony
and
denied
that
she
had
ever
--
that
he
had
ever
made
such
a
statement
to
her.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
don't
--
no,
i
don't
believe
it
did.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
did?
mr.
rosenfield
says
that
it
does
make
such
a
reference.
now,
at
the
'63
trial,
again
by
discovery,
we
learned
for
the
first
time
of
a
statement
in
the
prosecution
files
given
by
this
woman
very
shortly
after
the
crime.
at
the
'56
trial,
she
was
asked
how
long
she
had
known
the
petitioner
and
her
answer
was
two
years.
and
at
the
19
--
and
the
statement
that
she
gave
to
the
prosecution
right
after
the
crime
was
that
she
had
known
him
for
five
weeks.
now,
that
was
first
learned
by
us
in
1963.
then
there
was
a
whole
long
list
of
other
facts
known
to
the
prosecution
prior
to
the
‘56
trial
which
cast
serious
doubt
on
the
reliability
and
trustworthiness
of
this
witness.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
because
if
she
had
known
him
for
two
years,
mr.
justice
black
then
if
she
conveyed
the
impression
--
conveyed
the
impression
to
the
jury
that
it
was
the
--
that
there
was
the
kind
of
relationship
between
them
that
if
he
had
committed
a
crime
that
he
would
admit
it
to
her
whereas
if
it
was
only
five
weeks,
it
would
be
less
likely
that
he
would
make
such
an
admission
to
somebody
that
he
had
just
knew
very
briefly.
now,
the
--
my
time
has
expired,
your
honors
and
i
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
we're
not
going
to
--
because
i
have
mentioned
that
i
don't
want
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
think
that
they're
unimportant
but
there
were
serious
questions
with
regard
to
being
cut
off
in
the
examination
of
a
key
defense
witness
mrs.
alice
baxter
who
is
the
landlady.
and
the
landlady
came
up
to
the
1963
trial
and
said
that
he
was
in
his
room
in
her
house
at
the
time
that
the
crime
took
place.
in
'56,
before
the
trial,
the
defense
counsel
tried
to
interview
this
witness.
she
spoke
to
him
once
or
twice
and
then
the
--
then
she
called
the
prosecution
and
the
prosecution
told
her
that
she
has
a
constitutional
right
not
to
talk
to
the
defense
counsel
and
then
she
refused
to
talk
to
him
any
further.
so
she
was
listed
as
a
prosecution
witness
in
1956.
she
was
not
called
by
the
defense
in
'63,
as
i
said,
she
came
forward
and
she
said
that
he
was
in
her
house
at
the
time
of
crime.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
intended
to
deal
with
that
your
honor
but
my
time
is
going
down
except
for
the
fact
that
there
was
a
lie
about
the
hair
plus
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
told
--
he
asked
to
see
his
parents
and
the
police
told
him,
“you
can't
see
your
parents.
your
parents
don't
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you.”
and
all
the
time
the
parents
were
out
trying
to
find
out
where
he
was
in
lining
up
an
attorney.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that
is
the
fact,
your
honor
and
it
is
so
stated
in
the
record
and
in
fact
mr.
malmgren,
the
defense
counsel
said
i
will
not
state
that
she
is
unreliable.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
oh!
no,
no.
the
defense
counsel
would
refuse
to
say
that
she
was
unreliable.
his
point
was
that
he
didn't
know
what
her
testimony
was
going
to
be
and
he
couldn't
risk
being
bound
by
her
testimony.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no.
i
--
no.
i
would
say,
no.
but
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
record
that
say
that
they
put
in
an
affidavit
that
she
had
given
some
contrary
testimony
--
made
a
contrary
statement
to
a
prosecution
with
--
that
was
introduced
in
'63.
but
when
she
--
but
nobody
has
really
challenged
her
for
it.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
because
it
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
mr.
justice
black
because
it
cut
the
defense
off
not
only
from
this
live
witness.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
right.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
our
point
is
your
honor
that
it
was
wrong
for
the
prosecution
to
chill
the
defense
in
this
avenue
of
exploration.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
because
in
--
your
honor,
we
feel
that
in
a
murder
trial,
particularly,
that
the
defense
is
seriously
handicapped
if
the
prosecution
compel
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
right.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
your
honor,
no.
if
this
had
been
her
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
only
if
she
had
said
voluntarily
of
her
own
will,
“i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you”
then
perfectly
alright.
but
i
think
it
was
wrong
for
the
prosecution
to
say
to
her
to
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she
called
--
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
she
called
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
then
the
prosecuting
attorney
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
and
asked
him.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
not
to
testify
but
to
talk
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
correct.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she's
--
he
said
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
said
that
to
her
and
to
some
certain
other
witnesses
and
the
prosecutor
so
testified
in
'63.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
the
point
is
that
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
complete
that
inquiry
that
then
she
would
have
been
available
as
a
witness.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
if
the
defense
counsel
had
been
allowed
to
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
we
feel
that
his
advice
was
wrong
that
she
had
a
constitutional
right
and
so
forth.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
if
it
was
up
to
her,
she
could
make
her
own
decision
but
the
prosecution
should
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
i
think
you
should
have
said
to
her
in
fairness
to
the
defense
that
you
go
ahead
--
he
asked
to
prepare
his
case.
i
think
that
would've
been
the
part
where
it
is.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
do
your
honor.
well,
we
might
mention
also
that
the
gregory
case
which
decided
recently
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
somewhat
similar
circumstances.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
she
testified
in
1963.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
mr.
justice
white,
she
did
not.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
don't
know
what
they
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
put
in
their
own
evidence
on
that
point.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
put
in
evidence
saying
that
some
official
had
interviewed
her
and
she
had
told
them
--
given
them
a
different
story
but
she
testified
in
'63,
she
and
her
husband
and
the
two
grandchildren,
placing
him
in
the
house
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
we
don't
say
that
mr.
justice
white
because
that
was
just
a
hearsay
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
they
just
put
it
in
an
affidavit.
they
didn't
put
the
man
on
the
stand.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
that's
their
claim,
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
think
it
does.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
everything
that
we
desire
to
say
has
been
said,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
certainly.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
your
honor.
my
recollection
is
that
we
did.
yes,
we
did
rely
on
that.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
he
ruled
that
it
was
not
coerced,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
think
they
did.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
in
this
court?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
oh,
yes!
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
thank
you.
