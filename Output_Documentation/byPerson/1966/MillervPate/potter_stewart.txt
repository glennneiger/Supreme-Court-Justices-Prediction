justice
potter
stewart
did
his
confession
make
any
reference
to
having
admitted
the
crime
to
her?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
had.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
evidence
adduced
by
the
prosecution
at
the
trial
to
the
effect
that
this
hair
was
from
the
body
of
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
this
man
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
man
was
convicted
without
any
evidence
at
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
-
one
way
or
the
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
the
hair
is
from
his
body?
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
that
--
i
want
to
be
sure
he's
sure
what
he
did
admit
it
to
his
knowledge
at
the
time
of
--
at
the
clemency
hearing
or
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he
admitted
as
to
his
knowledge
at
the
time
of
the
trial
that
some
of
the
stains,
that
at
least
some
of
the
stains
were
not
blood.

well,
this
--
is
this
the
prosecuting
attorney
at
the
trial
who's
testifying?
justice
potter
stewart
580?
this
is
blaine
ramsey?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
you
were
referring
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
where
--
which
one
of
these
items
applies
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
pair
of
white
jockey
shorts?
justice
potter
stewart
described
as
number
17?
justice
potter
stewart
no
mention
of
paint
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
don't
you
think
under
a
case
like
napue
against
illinois,
the
critical
point
is,
even
if
there
was
blood
on
those
shorts,
a
misrepresentation
that
the
stains
you
could
see
there
was
blood
when
they
knew
it
was
--
if
they
knew
it
was
paint.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
the
knowing
use
of
concept
of
misrepresentation
by
the
prosecution
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
understand
it,
today
you
can't
find
any
blood
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
on
what's
in
there.
justice
potter
stewart
today
the
appearance
of
those
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally,
where
does
this
confession
appear
here,
anywhere
i
can't
--
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
the
two
places?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
of
volume

--

potter
stewart
right,
thank
you
very
much.

potter
stewart
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
you
were
starting
to
tell
us
at
the
time
that
i
interrupted
you
to
ask
you
where
in
the
record
the
confession
appeared.
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
starting
to
tell
us
that
in
his
confession,
he
admitted
that
those
shorts
were
his?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
never
made
any
confession.
justice
potter
stewart
i
found
--
i
find
on
a

that
he
said
he
did
this
--
discard
his
shorts
at
van
buren
flats,
but
that
doesn't
--
that's
not
the
same
as
saying
that
those
shorts
are
his.
