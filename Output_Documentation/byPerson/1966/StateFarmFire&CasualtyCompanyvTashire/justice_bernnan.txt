mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
but
the
money
came
in
court
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
liability
to
that
extent?
mr.
justice
bernnan
now
the
state
farm
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
i
gather
as
to
state
farm
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
all
of
them?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
how
is
that,
i
don’t
quite
follow
you.
your
clients
would
have
a
course
of
action
against
whom?
mr.
justice
bernnan
clark
has
been
insured
of
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
yes.
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
don’t
understand
how
you
would
be
denied
a
right
of
trial
by
jury
only
because
the
insurance
company
insuring
clark
puts
its
money
in
the
court,
why
is
that
and
why
your
right
of
trial
by
jury
on
the
issues
of
negligence
and
damages
as
against
greyhound?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
am
talking
now
to
the
trial
by
jury
court.
have
you
denied
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
against
--?
mr.
justice
bernnan
greyhound
has
no
claim
on
the
–
well
they
do
have
an
independent
claim
on
this
fund
but
that’s
their
cause
of
action
whereas
your
cause
of
action
i
frankly
can't
see
how
you
be
denied
a
right
trial
by
jury
not
only
against
greyhound
but
even
against
clark?
mr.
justice
bernnan
then
stay
all
proceedings
elsewhere,
but
has
the
trial
judge
here
has
said
you
do
not
have
a
trial
by
jury
on
your
claim
against
greyhound
or
clark
for
that
matter?
mr.
justice
bernnan
this
surely
the
state
farm’s
case
against
(inaudible)
since
clark,
as
i
understand
it
could
be
reached
only
in
oregon?
mr.
justice
bernnan
so
it
cannot
be
transferred.
i
thought
the
provision
of
the
rule
was
that
the
transfer
may
only,
maybe
made
only
to
a
district
where
the
suit
might
be
brought
and
surely
state
farm’s
claim
against
clark
could
not
have
been
brought
in
california
or
montana
or
elsewhere?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
in
this,
but
in
this
situation
as
i
understood
state
farm
could
bring
the
suit
only
in
oregon
because
that’s
where
clark
lives?
it
could
not
have
brought
this
action
in
california
or
montana,
correct?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
i
know
but
he
is
not,
he
lives
in
oregon.
mr.
justice
bernnan
that
means
that
if
that’s
so,
then
the
action
could
not
be
transferred
from
oregon
that
is
the
state
farm’s
action
against
clark
could
not
be
transferred
from
california
or
to
montana?
mr.

isn't
