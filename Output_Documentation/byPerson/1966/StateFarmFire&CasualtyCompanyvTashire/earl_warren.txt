chief

mr.
chaivoe?
chief

might
there
been
a
injury
because
of
different
wrongful
death
statutes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
under
the
restraining
order
you
cannot
now
file
a
suit
in
california,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chaivoe
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
question
about
the
scope
of
this
restraining
order
under
these
circumstances.
assume
that
as
a
result
of
this
accident
there
were
suits
filed
in
each
of
the
western
states
that
have
different
wrongful
death
statutes
and
so
forth
and
would
the
insurance
company
if,
if
we
affirm
this
judgment,
would
the
insurance
company
have
the
right
to
choose
its
own
forum
for
this
purpose
and
then
compel
everyone
to
go
to
that
one
forum
rather
than
the
forum
that
had
chosen
for
their
lawsuit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
gearin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
go
into
that
argument
mr.
gearin
would
you,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
chaivoe
as
to
the
question
i
just
asked
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gearin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
peruse
the
question
of
mr.
justice
black
asked
you
a
few
moments
ago.
suppose
out
of
these
35
claimants,
there
was
one
paraplegic
up
in
maine,
another
one
down
in
florida,
another
one
in
california
and
this
order
that
was
made
below
is
in
effect.
could
the
district
court
in
oregon
say
although
we
have
jurisdiction
here
under
this
interpleader,
we
would
transfer
the
maine
case
to
maine,
the
florida
case
to
florida
and
the
california
case
to
california
because
it
would
be
inconvenient
for
these
paraplegics,
to
have
to
come
to
oregon
to
try
this
lawsuit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
have
the
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
looked
into
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don’t
you
think
that’s
a
very
important
thing
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
question
of
liability
is
most
important
to
the
greyhound?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
question
of
whether
the
lawsuit
is
to
be
tried
might
be
of
great
importance
to
a
paraplegic
plaintiff
as
i
understand
there
is
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
the
whole
35?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
what
i’m
asking
is,
can
they
maintain
the
jurisdiction
over
in
the
oregon
court
and
then
say
case
a
shall
go
to
state
of
maine,
case
b
shall
go
to
florida,
case
c
shall
go
to
california
because
of
the
injustice
it
would
do
if
those
plaintiffs
have
to
come
to
oregon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
half
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question
mr.
gearin?
if
you
did
not
have
--
if
your
greyhound
didn’t
have
this
insurance,
would
it
be
entitled
to
be
here
today?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
difference
--
the
only
difference
between
not
having
the
insurance
and
having
it
would
be
that
the
oregon
court
in
this
situation
has
given
jurisdiction
where
otherwise
it
would
not
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this,
if
that
is
true
and
if
it
does
save
you
an
enormous
amount
of
money
to
have
this
right,
the
interpleaders
as
you
exercise
it
here,
would
there
be
anything
to
prevent
greyhound
from
just
having
a
nominal
amount
of
insurance
and
then
carrying
it’s
own
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
have
it
for
the
sole
purpose
of
getting
them
to
proceeding
of
this
kind
where
otherwise
would
not
have
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
the
question
isn't
fallacious,
the
answer
might
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
answer
might
be,
but
how
about,
what
is
the
answer
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
every
big
carrier
have
the
insurance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
were
considered
foolish
and
worthy
in
assuming
this
liability.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
there
be
anymore
if
they
had
a
small
amount
of
insurance
to
go
--

justice
earl
warren

well.
