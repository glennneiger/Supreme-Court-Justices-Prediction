the

mr.

yes

i
do.
mr.

no
sir,
the
district

in
the
exercise

its
sound
discretion
and
this
is
a
point
which
we
wanted
to
point
out
not
only
in
this
point
but
in
other
facets
of
this
problem
as
well
that
this
court
should
welcome
the

it
should
interpret
liberally
this
remedial

bearing
in

that
it
is

and
of
the

where
the

should
be

other
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
well,
i’ll
answer
this.
the
court
has
discretion
to
transfer
any
case
from
its
own
district
to
another
district
which
would
be
the
most
appropriate
forum
in
a
case
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
the
whole
case
sir.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
no
sir,
this
should
be,
sir
i
thought
that
there
should
be
one
case
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
it
could
have
been
brought
had
mr.
clark
been

all
the
actions
could
have
been
brought
in
the
state.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
if
clark
had
been
subject
to
service.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
it,
that
may
well
be,
but
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
is
the
rule,
but
is
there
anything
inherently
wrong
in
trying
this
case
in
oregon.
the
oregon
district
court
sits
in
medford,
oregon
which
is
about
25
or
30
miles
away
from
the
situs
of
this
particular
accident.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
do.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
it
could
be
have
been
sued
in
any
state
in
united
states,
any
province
of
canada
where
it
does
business
and
we
would
be
faced
with
35
different
cases
clogging
the
courts.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
we
are
not.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
is
correct
and
it
is
a
benefit
not
only
to
greyhound
but
to
the
public,
to
the
parties,
the
claimants,
the
assured
and
the
insurer
as
well.
one
of
the
things
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
is
under
1335,
but
this
particular
action
also
involves
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
by
the
insurer
to
determine
the
initial
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
coverage
and
that
particular
phase
of
this
proceeding
must
be
brought
in
the
district
of
oregon.
the
interpleader
statute
under
1335
gives
any
district
in
which
one
or
more
of
the
adverse
claimants
resides
then
you
--
of
the
actions
which
could
be
in
california.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
there
are
adverse
claimants
your
honor.
the
cases
so
hold,
adams
underwriters
versus
lloyd's
and
the
revere
case.
because
to
say
that
an
widow
with
two
children
who
has
lost
the
breadwinner
of
the
family
is
not
an
adverse
claimant
to
an
insurance
policy
that
insurers
the
man
who
drove
over
the
wrong
side
of
the
highway
is
certainly
felicitous
in
the
extreme.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
no
that
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
they
were
not
adverse,
but
it
offends
our
sense
of
reality
to
say
that
an
insurance
company
does
not
met
with
adverse
claims
when
its
insured
is
obviously
a
tortfeasor,
obviously
owes
this
money
and
there
is
just
a
limited
fund.
they
are
adverse
one
for
the
other
and
in
this
case
there
are
only
nine
of
these
35
claimants
who
seek
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
the
district
court's
discretion
in
this
matter.
the
rest
of
the
many
claimants,
some
20
odd
in
number,
have
go
along
with
what
the
district
court
has
done,
because
they
feel
it’s
proper.
these
small
group
of
claimants
seek
to
take
some
advantage,
undue
advantage
of
the
other
claimants.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
absolutely
not
greyhound
in
this
case
with
its
answer
and
cross
complaint
for
declaratory
relief
interposed
a
demand
for
trial
by
a
jury.
adams
and
revere
cases
holds
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
jury.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
is
within
the
discretion,
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
court.
under
rule
42
the
court
can
consolidate
cases
where
they
have
the
same
issue
of
fact
and
law.
and
to
think
that
a
district
court
would
for
35
consecutive
weeks
try
one
case
after
the
other,
the
same
case,
the
same
witness
is
ridiculous
because
the
court
would
be
subject
to
censor.
the
rule
was
designed,
rule
42
was
designed
to
prevent
delays,
to
have
a
consolidation
of
cases
where
you
have
the
same
identical
question
of
fact
and
law
and
the
same
thing
involves
whether
you
have
a
passenger
on
the
left
side
of
the
bus
or
a
passenger
on
the
right
side
of
the
bus,
you
still
have
the
identical
questions
which
should
be
consolidated
for
trial
under
the
rule.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
yes
sir.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
think
that
the
court
might
well
have
the
discretion
to
do
so
if
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that.
i
would
make
this
alternative
suggestion
as
a
solution
because
i
do
not
know
whether
the
court
will
have
the
power.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
have
not
sir.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
the
most
important
thing,
if
it
pleases
the
chief
justice
is
the
question
of
liability.
we
think
that
and
so
far
as
we’re
concerned
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
and
to
the
claimants
as
well.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
there’s
one
paraplegic
plaintiff
mr.
wood
who
resides
in
california.
now,
the
case
may
well
be
tried
to
–
be
sent
to
california
by
the
district
court
if
he
has
the
opportunity
to
exercise
that
discretion.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
yes
that’s
where
the
accident
happened.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
think
not
with
respect
to
a
segregated
trial
of
liability.
perhaps
with
regard
to
their
trial
of
damages,
the
court
may
well
have
jurisdiction
to
say
we’ll
try
a
liability
here
and
if
there
is
liability
mr.
wood
you
may
try
this
case
elsewhere
because
your
doctors
are
in
maine,
your
doctors
are
here,
you
reside
here.
now,
that
may
very
well
be
the
situation.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that’s
correct
because
the
court
has
given
broad
discretion,
it's
given
these
wonderful
tools
to
the
federal
rules
to
bifurcate
the
trial,
to
consolidate,
to
have
his
pretrial
practices
and
kept
them
all
together.
one
further
thing
that
bothers
me
was
a
comment
by
the
court
with
regard
to
the
varying
death
limits.
in
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
the
district
court
in
which
the
case
is
tried
in
an
interpleader
action
applies
the
conflicts
of
law,
rule
of
the
state
where
it
says
that
is
the
case
of
griffin
versus
mccoach,
a
1946
case
in
313
u.s.
the
reason
text
writers
however
say
that
it
should
--
that
problem
of
conflicts
of
law
should
be
decided
by
the
district
court
within
the
limits
of
his
discretion
and
that’s
one
thing
that
we
ask
again
that
this
court
extend
the
jurisdiction
to
this
type
of
case,
how,
when,
where
and
the
manner
in
which
the
discretion
is
exercised,
the
jurisdiction
is
held,
is
to
be
determined
by
the
district
court
according
to
the
individual
case
the
facts
than
before
it.
this
court
should
not
place
a
tight
and
begrudging
hand
on
this
statute
which
says
1335
when
there
are
two
more
adverse
claimants
to
the
same
fund.
we
are
here
incidentally,
we’re
not
the
petitioner.
thank
you.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
greyhound
would
not
be
entitled
to
be
here
today
unless
it
were
named
a
defendant
in
a
interpleader
action.
greyhound
in
this
accident
had
no
insurance.
they
were
self
insurers
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
we
would
not
have
a
right
if
it
pleases
the
chief
justice
to
come
into
court
and
say,
we
--
everyone
is
suing
us
all
over,
we
want
them
all
in
one
basket,
we
would
like
to
have
that
right
because
the
expense
of
defending
35
cases
up
and
down
the
pacific
coast
and
throughout
the
united
states
is
a
tremendous
task
on
the
witnesses
and
parties.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
is
correct,
it
would
not
have
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that’s
the
suggestion
made
by
the
amicus
curiae
i
think
it’s
entirely
fallacious
if
it
pleases
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
didn’t
mean
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
the
answer
is
one
of
the
economic
impossibility.
no
businessman
would
deliberately
have
low
limits
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
this
and
we
don’t
look
forward
to
this
catastrophes.
the
insurance
is
to
protect,
the
insurance
is
to
protect
the
individual
for
which
a
substantial
premium
is
paid
and
your
honor
misunderstood
me,
the
statements
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae
are
absurd.
to
think
--
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
a
responsible
business
will
deliberately
go
out
and
have
a
small
policy
of
insurance
which
would
expose
the
company
to
tremendous
liability
just
to
take
advantage
of
something
like
this.
the
insurance
is
to
protect
the
company
against
liability
imposed
by
law
and
if
you
don’t
have
insurance
i
think
that
the
--
it
would
be
poor
business
practice,
it
would
be
unsound
economically
for
a
company
to
have
this
in
mind
when
they
go
out
to
do
it,
it
imputes
the
bona
fides
of
everyday
business
and
i
assure
the
court
that
insofar
as
greyhound
is
concerned,
we
don’t
have
it
and
the
stockholders
certainly
could
bitterly
complaint
against
any
management
that
were
foolhardy.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
most
carriers
do,
there
are
some
who
are
self
insurers,
as
greyhound
was
in
the
accident
we’re
talking
about
here.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
and
we
would
have
no
right
to
interplead.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
no,
but
they
didn’t
setup
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
would
be
merely
a
dummy
for
impure
motives
which
we
didn’t
not
have
and
we
do
not
have.
insurance
is
to
protect
the
public,
and
the
public
should
be
protected
in
this
case.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
thank
you
sir.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
i
am
appearing

obviously
owes
this
money
and
there
is
just
a
limited
fund.
they
are
adverse
one
for
the
other
and
in
this
case
there
are
only
nine
of
these
35
claimants
who
seek
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
the
district
court's
discretion
in
this
matter.
the
rest
of
the
many
claimants,
some
20
odd
in
number,
have
go
along
with
what
the
district
court
has
done,
because
they
feel
it’s
proper.
these
small
group
of
claimants
seek
to
take
some
advantage,
undue
advantage
of
the
other
claimants.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
absolutely
not
greyhound
in
this
case
with
its
answer
and
cross
complaint
for
declaratory
relief
interposed
a
demand
for
trial
by
a
jury.
adams
and
revere
cases
holds
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
jury.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
is
within
the
discretion,
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
court.
under
rule
42
the
court
can
consolidate
cases
where
they
have
the
same
issue
of
fact
and
law.
and
to
think
that
a
district
court
would
for
35
consecutive
weeks
try
one
case
after
the
other,
the
same
case,
the
same
witness
is
ridiculous
because
the
court
would
be
subject
to
censor.
the
rule
was
designed,
rule
42
was
designed
to
prevent
delays,
to
have
a
consolidation
of
cases
where
you
have
the
same
identical
question
of
fact
and
law
and
the
same
thing
involves
whether
you
have
a
passenger
on
the
left
side
of
the
bus
or
a
passenger
on
the
right
side
of
the
bus,
you
still
have
the
identical
questions
which
should
be
consolidated
for
trial
under
the
rule.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
yes
sir.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
think
that
the
court
might
well
have
the
discretion
to
do
so
if
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that.
i
would
make
this
alternative
suggestion
as
a
solution
because
i
do
not
know
whether
the
court
will
have
the
power.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
have
not
sir.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
the
most
important
thing,
if
it
pleases
the
chief
justice
is
the
question
of
liability.
we
think
that
and
so
far
as
we’re
concerned
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
and
to
the
claimants
as
well.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
there’s
one
paraplegic
plaintiff
mr.
wood
who
resides
in
california.
now,
the
case
may
well
be
tried
to
–
be
sent
to
california
by
the
district
court
if
he
has
the
opportunity
to
exercise
that
discretion.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
yes
that’s
where
the
accident
happened.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
think
not
with
respect
to
a
segregated
trial
of
liability.
perhaps
with
regard
to
their
trial
of
damages,
the
court
may
well
have
jurisdiction
to
say
we’ll
try
a
liability
here
and
if
there
is
liability
mr.
wood
you
may
try
this
case
elsewhere
because
your
doctors
are
in
maine,
your
doctors
are
here,
you
reside
here.
now,
that
may
very
well
be
the
situation.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that’s
correct
because
the
court
has
given
broad
discretion,
it's
given
these
wonderful
tools
to
the
federal
rules
to
bifurcate
the
trial,
to
consolidate,
to
have
his
pretrial
practices
and
kept
them
all
together.
one
further
thing
that
bothers
me
was
a
comment
by
the
court
with
regard
to
the
varying
death
limits.
in
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
the
district
court
in
which
the
case
is
tried
in
an
interpleader
action
applies
the
conflicts
of
law,
rule
of
the
state
where
it
says
that
is
the
case
of
griffin
versus
mccoach,
a
1946
case
in
313
u.s.
the
reason
text
writers
however
say
that
it
should
--
that
problem
of
conflicts
of
law
should
be
decided
by
the
district
court
within
the
limits
of
his
discretion
and
that’s
one
thing
that
we
ask
again
that
this
court
extend
the
jurisdiction
to
this
type
of
case,
how,
when,
where
and
the
manner
in
which
the
discretion
is
exercised,
the
jurisdiction
is
held,
is
to
be
determined
by
the
district
court
according
to
the
individual
case
the
facts
than
before
it.
this
court
should
not
place
a
tight
and
begrudging
hand
on
this
statute
which
says
1335
when
there
are
two
more
adverse
claimants
to
the
same
fund.
we
are
here
incidentally,
we’re
not
the
petitioner.
thank
you.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
greyhound
would
not
be
entitled
to
be
here
today
unless
it
were
named
a
defendant
in
a
interpleader
action.
greyhound
in
this
accident
had
no
insurance.
they
were
self
insurers
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
we
would
not
have
a
right
if
it
pleases
the
chief
justice
to
come
into
court
and
say,
we
--
everyone
is
suing
us
all
over,
we
want
them
all
in
one
basket,
we
would
like
to
have
that
right
because
the
expense
of
defending
35
cases
up
and
down
the
pacific
coast
and
throughout
the
united
states
is
a
tremendous
task
on
the
witnesses
and
parties.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
is
correct,
it
would
not
have
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that’s
the
suggestion
made
by
the
amicus
curiae
i
think
it’s
entirely
fallacious
if
it
pleases
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
i
didn’t
mean
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
the
answer
is
one
of
the
economic
impossibility.
no
businessman
would
deliberately
have
low
limits
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
this
and
we
don’t
look
forward
to
this
catastrophes.
the
insurance
is
to
protect,
the
insurance
is
to
protect
the
individual
for
which
a
substantial
premium
is
paid
and
your
honor
misunderstood
me,
the
statements
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae
are
absurd.
to
think
--
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
a
responsible
business
will
deliberately
go
out
and
have
a
small
policy
of
insurance
which
would
expose
the
company
to
tremendous
liability
just
to
take
advantage
of
something
like
this.
the
insurance
is
to
protect
the
company
against
liability
imposed
by
law
and
if
you
don’t
have
insurance
i
think
that
the
--
it
would
be
poor
business
practice,
it
would
be
unsound
economically
for
a
company
to
have
this
in
mind
when
they
go
out
to
do
it,
it
imputes
the
bona
fides
of
everyday
business
and
i
assure
the
court
that
insofar
as
greyhound
is
concerned,
we
don’t
have
it
and
the
stockholders
certainly
could
bitterly
complaint
against
any
management
that
were
foolhardy.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
most
carriers
do,
there
are
some
who
are
self
insurers,
as
greyhound
was
in
the
accident
we’re
talking
about
here.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
and
we
would
have
no
right
to
interplead.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
no,
but
they
didn’t
setup
--
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
that
would
be
merely
a
dummy
for
impure
motives
which
we
didn’t
not
have
and
we
do
not
have.
insurance
is
to
protect
the
public,
and
the
public
should
be
protected
in
this
case.
mr.
john
gordon
gearin
thank
you
sir.
