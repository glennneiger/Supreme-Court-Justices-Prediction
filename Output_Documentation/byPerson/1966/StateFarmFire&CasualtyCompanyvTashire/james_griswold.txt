mr.
james
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
may
please
the
court.
as
mr.
chaivoe
indicated
to
the
court
the
basic
grounds
of
our
being
here
two-pronged,
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
we
feel
that
we
are
representing
these
clients
and
have
the
obligation
of
presenting
this
issue
to
the
court.
mr.
james
griswold
we
are
yes
your
honor
i
am
that’s
correct
mr.
chaivoe’s
interest
and
mine
here
are
identical.
mr.
james
griswold
that’s
correct
your
honor.
if
the
court
passes
on
this
question
of
jurisdiction
it
may
not
reach
these
other
things
as
to
jury
trial.
in
our
case
for
these
clients
of
course
an
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit
would
solve
these
problems.
actually
the
problems
are
much
more
far
reaching
than
the
question
of
service
upon
the
canadian
and
this
i
think
is
well
borne
out
by
the
other
two
decisions
that
are
matters,
cases
that
are
now
pending,
cases
that
have
been
presented
to
the
district
court
in
oregon,
as
presented
to
this
court
by
the
brief
amicus
curiae
and
the
case
of
travelers
insurance
versus
greyhound
out
of
louisiana.
we
have
given
the
citation
in
our
brief
of
the
travelers
case.
for
the
court’s
information
that
the
matter
has
been
taken
to
the
fifth
circuit,
oral
arguments
were
held
on
february
1st,
this
is
the
travelers
versus
greyhound
case.
the
primary
problem
that
concerns
us
in
the
overall
picture
is
this
question
of
a
jury
trial.
what
kind
of
a
jury
trial
if
any
would
be
obtained
by
these
people
if
interfered
–
mr.
james
griswold
how
would
i
feel
about
that?
mr.
james
griswold
if
a
jury
trial
was
granted
i
then
would
ask
the
court
what
kind
of
a
jury
trial?
is
this
were
35
attorneys
representing
35
plaintiffs
would
appear
in
one
trial
before
the
court
on
liability,
or
one
trial
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
damages
as
to
these
people,
one
jury
for
all
of
these
issues
or
would
there
be
separate
jury
trials
each
--
for
each
party,
each
injured
person
on
the
question
of
liability
and
upon
the
question
of
damage.
mr.
james
griswold
the
only
damage
that
i
could
then
see
from
a
selfish
point
of
view
for
the
injured
people
would
be
that
they
could
not
then
choose
--
make
the
choice
of
forum
that
they
would
presently
have
if
it
were
not
for
interpleader.
that
the
residents
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
longview
case
is
presently
on
file
in
the
general
fire
versus
greyhound,
they
could
not
proceed
in
longview,
washington.
the
residents
of
the
state
of
california
could
not
proceed
in
california.
this
would
be
the
damage
or
the
injury.
in
a
personal
injury
case
of
course
the
choice
of
forum
is
most
important
to
the
injured
party.
and
i
say
this
because
they
have
the
right
to
choose
their
attorney
that
will
represent
them
rather
than
a
trial
committee.
they
most
often
will
hurry
to
their
homes
after
an
injury
and
seek
the
attention
of
their
family
doctor.
the
cost
of
taking
depositions
or
having
their
doctors
travel
a
distance
to
the
place
of
trial
could
be
substantial.
these
are
the
ramifications
of
taking
these
people
from
so
many
states
and
so
many
of
them
and
bringing
them
all
together
in
one
state
oregon,
california,
washington
whatever
it
might
be
or
it
could
have
been
possibly
except
for
the
policy
defense
here,
it
could
have
been
montana.
so
it
isn’t
just
a
grant
or
denial
of
a
jury
trial.
it's
a
grant
or
denial
of
all
of
these
other
aspects
which
accompany
a
jury
trial
and
speaking
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
cause
and
i
feel
that
i
am
speaking
for
plaintiffs
in
the
louisiana
bus
accident
and
the
plaintiffs
in
the
grants
pass
oregon
accident.
interpleader
in
this
type
situation,
even
with
an
individual
jury
trial
for
each
party
injured,
if
through
interpleader
would
have
necessity
be
in
one
court
in
one
jurisdiction
and
would
cause
additional
expense
and
additional
delay.
mr.
james
griswold
no,
i
don’t
believe
that
i
would
approve
that
statement
your
honor.
the
interpleader
proceeding
means
that
everybody
is
brought
to
--
in
my
mind,
everybody
is
brought
to
one
court,
the
appropriate
restraining
orders
are
entered
preventing
them
from
doing
anything
other
than
in
that
court
and
if
in
this
case
by
their
complaint
if
it's
found
that
there
is
insurance
coverage
that
money
would
then
be
deposited
in
court
and
state
farm
will
then
walk
away.
this
of
course
is
what
they
want.
mr.
james
griswold
yes
that’s
correct,
(inaudible)
yes.
mr.
james
griswold
yes
and
there
this
is
additional
consequence
your
honor.
mr.
james
griswold
basically
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
griswold
well
the
question
your
honor
under
the
bill
hart
(ph)
case
is
whether
or
not
under
the
oregon
law
these
people
are
claimants.
mr.
james
griswold
well
its
claimants
who
are
claiming,
or
may
claim.
the
ninth
circuit
court
held
that
these
people
in
this
position
in
an
action
arising
out
of
tort
were
not
claimants
within
the
meaning
of
the
interpleader
act
because
they
could
not
be
claimants
against
this
petitioner
in
oregon
state
farm.
a
distinction
which
i
must
make
in
this
situation
is
the
duties
and
the
responsibilities
of
this
petitioner,
state
farm,
as
compared
to
the
duties
and
the
responsibilities
the
majority
of
the
interpleader
proceedings.
i'm
talking
about
the
life
insurance
companies,
i'm
talking
about
the
trust
companies,
the
bond
companies,
the
surety
broker,
bonds
on
broker
surety
bond.
in
these
situations
the
person
that
is
obligated
to
make
payment
of
money
has
only
one
obligation
and
that
is
to
pay
that
money
and
two
or
three
people
claim
that
from
him,
he
doesn't
know
which
way
to
turn
so
the
interpleader
statute
protects
him,
he
plays
into
court
in
that
ends
it.
state
farm
has
two
obligations
under
this
contract.
when
they
sell
this
insurance
policy,
they
have
several
hands
out
receiving
the
money.
this
comes
in
to
cover
the
cost
of
claims.
they
have
a
handout
to
cover
the
agency
premium.
also
included
in
this
is
the
hand
that
covers
the
cost
of
defense,
because
they
have
in
this
contract
the
duty
and
the
obligation
to
defend
all
the
lawsuits
brought
against
their
assurers.
now
selfishly
speaking
we
are
not
interested
as
to
whether
state
farm’s
assurers
are
by
protected
by
state
farm
or
not
on
the
face
of
it,
but
basically
we
are
when
there
is
a
limited
policy
as
here
--
mr.
james
griswold
that’s
true,
yes
it
does.
mr.
james
griswold
my
answer
is
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
the
only
qualifications
of
that
language
are
the
decisions
of
the
various
district
and
circuit
courts
which
are
cited
in
the
briefs.
some
of
these
courts
say
it
doesn't
apply
in
this
of
type
situation
others
have
said
that
it
does.
i
started
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
interest
we
do
have
in
state
farm
defending
its
insured,
it’s
assured
and
that
is
that
if
there
are
funds,
individual
funds
of
the
assured
and
actions
are
maintained
against
him,
without
the
insurance
defense
the
providing
of
a
defense
for
the
assured,
his
own
individual
funds
would
have
to
be
used
to
retain
counsel
and
court
cost
and
this
in
a
case
of
this
nature
would
becomes
substantial
and
any
funds
that
the
individual
defendant
might
have
which
would
normally
under
judgments
shall
i
say
be
available
to
the
injured
parties
would
be
spent
in
performing
a
duty,
which
we
feel
or
performing
the
function
of
defending
this
case
which
we
feel
is
the
duty
of
state
farm.
now
there
are
we
feel
--
mr.
james
griswold
state
farm
in
their
complaint
has
said
one
we
have
the
policy
defense.
they
have
said
we
don’t
feel
we
have
the
duty
to
defend
for
that
reason.
they
say
also
if
we
have
the
duty
and
if
there
is
liability
here
are
the
$20,000
we
would
like
to
be
relieved
of
the
duty
of
defending,
this
is
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
prayer.
mr.
james
griswold
to
my
knowledge
your
honor
the
insured
has
not
made
an
appearance
in
this
cause.
now
i
would
agree
--
i
would
think
he
would
be
most
unhappy.
he
is
--
he
is
left
completely
unprotected
if
this
were
to
happen.
mr.
james
griswold
no,
no.
this
matter
comes
to
this
court
very
early
in
the
pleading
stage.
the
restraining
order
was
entered.
greyhound
filed
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order
and
to
dismiss
the
action
and
then
withdrew
that
motion.
now
it
says
it
would
be
convenient
if
they
are
permitted
to
come
in.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order
and
to
dismiss.
this
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
courts’
opinion.
mr.
james
griswold
your
honor
i
don’t
believe
this
is
their
position,
i
think
their
position
is
that
they
have
right
to
interpleader
only
if
they
can
show.
mr.
james
griswold
the
claims
will
exceed
the
amount
of
the
policy
which
they
have
done
here.
mr.
james
griswold
well,
the
basic
purpose,
the
foundation
for
interpleader
is
to
remove
the
danger
to
the
petitioner
in
an
interpleader
proceeding
from
possibly
being
held
for
more
than
their
contractual
duty.
a
life
insurance
company,
a
suit
for
$
10,000
in
new
york
and
a
policy
in
10,000
in
california.
interpleader
permits
them
to
bring
both
people
in
one
court
and
they
only
have
to
pay
the
one
$
10,000.
this
is
one
of
the
primary
functions
of
interpleader
as
i
read
the
decisions
and
the
works
by
professor
chapman.
so
if
it
would
be
impossible
or
if
the
petitioner
and
interpleader
could
not
show
that
the
claims
exceed
the
amount
of
the
fund
if
i
may
use
that
expression,
i
don’t
believe
they
would
be
entitled
to
interpleader
at
all.
mr.
james
griswold
i
would
basically
say
no
it
has
not
been
frequent
up
to
now.
the
cases
are
sparse
on
this
point.
since
this
matter
has
come
into
our
office
there
have
now
been
three
involving
greyhound
only
and
yet
i
can’t
help
but
comment
that
i
see
in
the
paper
or
on
television
of
a
lady
that
caused
the
death
of
several
children
in
the
state
--
in
new
england,
i
don’t
recall
the
state.
i
think
there
was
also
a
school
bus
accident
with
several
injuries
and
i
believe
some
deaths
within
the
last
few
years
--
within
the
last
few
weeks.
i
think
as
we
grow
and
as
our
highways
fill
with
vehicles
that
carry
more
and
more
people
this
problem
will
become
more
and
more
common.
the
situation
we
face
here
is
an
attempt
to
develop
this
particular
law,
this
theory
or
rule
of
law
and
i
think
that
it’s
gone
beyond
bounds
already
and
i’m
thinking
of
the
case
as
presented
to
this
court
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae.
if
the
court
will
recall
the
contents,
this
would
indicate
that
greyhound
incorporated
owns
greyhound
lines
and
owns
an
insurance
company.
the
insurance
company
had
a
$
500,000
policy
on
greyhound
lines.
they
have
filed
a
similar
matter
with
it
being
a
single
vehicle
accident
that
happened
in
oregon.
i
can
see
as
indicated
in
brief
amicus
curiae
a
possibility
that
the
insurance
programs
as
they
might
develop
in
the
future
would
make
efforts
to
take
advantage
of
this
situation.
we
indicated
in
our
brief
that
if
interpleader
is
granted
there
would
appear
that
the
result
reached
in
travelers
indemnity
versus
greyhound
would
be
an
appropriate
relief.
this
is
a
limited
restraining
order
which
is
the
thing
that
shall
i
say
damages
or
hurts
the
injured
people
in
an
interpleader.
what
it
does
is
prevent
these
people
from
executing
on
judgments,
executing
against
the
insurance
carrier,
but
they
may
proceed
as
they
wish
to
obtain
these
judgments.
mr.
james
griswold
no
it
would
not.
mr.
james
griswold
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
of
course
when
you
asked
would
it
relived
his
duty
to
defend
i
asked
--
mr.
james
griswold
no
i
don’t
mean
this
your
honor.
i
ask
whether
or
not
under
that
policy
he
has
any
right
to
be
relived
of
that
duty.
this
is
the
question
that
i
ask
and
i
submit
no,
that
he
is
duty
bound
that
he
cannot
take
advantage
of
this
situation,
at
least
he
assured
on
his
own
and
avoid
the
defense
of
these
cases.
mr.
james
griswold
my
answer
has
to
be
yes.
mr.
james
griswold
my
answer
has
to
yes.
i
don’t
like
the
expression
sky
is
the
limit,
but
my
answer
is
yes
to
that
question.
this
is
their
obligation.
this
is
should
if
it
is
not
now,
it
should
be
build
into
their
premium
rating
system
because
we
can
reach
a
point
here
your
honor
where
whenever
we
have
an
out
of
state
insurance
carrier
involved
in
accident
with
two
or
three
people
in
an
automobile,
immediately
we
are
an
interpleader.
we
get
back
to
my
question
of
a
jury
trial.
the
convenience
of
the
party,
this
happens
in
oregon
interpleader’s
filed
in
oregon.
we
get
back
to
our
jury
trial
and
whether
or
not
under
the
interpleader
system.
of
course
the
signal
oil
case
is
cited
in
petitioner’s
brief
indicates
fairly
that
there
is
no
jury
trial
authorized
in
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
because
it
is
an
equity,
but
assume
that,
that
rule
is
modified
by
this
court
in
this
matter,
still
i
question
whether
it
would
be
in
fact
the
jury
trial
is
guaranteed
by
our
oregon
constitution.
i
have
just
a
very
few
moments
left
that
might
be
the
court
if
there
are
any
other
questions
that
i’ve
not
answered
or
not
touched
on.
mr.
james
griswold
in
interpleader
yes
and
this
is
what’s
happened
in
all
three
of
these
greyhound
cases
rather,
the
answer
is
yes,
they
have
done.
i
see
my
time
is
up
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
may
please
the
court.
as
mr.
chaivoe
indicated
to
the
court
the
basic
grounds
of
our
being
here
two-pronged,
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
we
feel
that
we
are
representing
these
clients
and
have
the
obligation
of
presenting
this
issue
to
the
court.
mr.
james
griswold
we
are
yes
your
honor
i
am
that’s
correct
mr.
chaivoe’s
interest
and
mine
here
are
identical.
mr.
james
griswold
that’s
correct
your
honor.
if
the
court
passes
on
this
question
of
jurisdiction
it
may
not
reach
these
other
things
as
to
jury
trial.
in
our
case
for
these
clients
of
course
an
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit
would
solve
these
problems.
actually
the
problems
are
much
more
far
reaching
than
the
question
of
service
upon
the
canadian
and
this
i
think
is
well
borne
out
by
the
other
two
decisions
that
are
matters,
cases
that
are
now
pending,
cases
that
have
been
presented
to
the
district
court
in
oregon,
as
presented
to
this
court
by
the
brief
amicus
curiae
and
the
case
of
travelers
insurance
versus
greyhound
out
of
louisiana.
we
have
given
the
citation
in
our
brief
of
the
travelers
case.
for
the
court’s
information
that
the
matter
has
been
taken
to
the
fifth
circuit,
oral
arguments
were
held
on
february
1st,
this
is
the
travelers
versus
greyhound
case.
the
primary
problem
that
concerns
us
in
the
overall
picture
is
this
question
of
a
jury
trial.
what
kind
of
a
jury
trial
if
any
would
be
obtained
by
these
people
if
interfered
–
mr.
james
griswold
how
would
i
feel
about
that?
mr.
james
griswold
if
a
jury
trial
was
granted
i
then
would
ask
the
court
what
kind
of
a
jury
trial?
is
this
were
35
attorneys
representing
35
plaintiffs
would
appear
in
one
trial
before
the
court
on
liability,
or
one
trial
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
damages
as
to
these
people,
one
jury
for
all
of
these
issues
or
would
there
be
separate
jury
trials
each
--
for
each
party,
each
injured
person
on
the
question
of
liability
and
upon
the
question
of
damage.
mr.
james
griswold
the
only
damage
that
i
could
then
see
from
a
selfish
point
of
view
for
the
injured
people
would
be
that
they
could
not
then
choose
--
make
the
choice
of
forum
that
they
would
presently
have
if
it
were
not
for
interpleader.
that
the
residents
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
longview
case
is
presently
on
file
in
the
general
fire
versus
greyhound,
they
could
not
proceed
in
longview,
washington.
the
residents
of
the
state
of
california
could
not
proceed
in
california.
this
would
be
the
damage
or
the
injury.
in
a
personal
injury
case
of
course
the
choice
of
forum
is
most
important
to
the
injured
party.
and
i
say
this
because
they
have
the
right
to
choose
their
attorney
that
will
represent
them
rather
than
a
trial
committee.
they
most
often
will
hurry
to
their
homes
after
an
injury
and
seek
the
attention
of
their
family
doctor.
the
cost
of
taking
depositions
or
having
their
doctors
travel
a
distance
to
the
place
of
trial
could
be
substantial.
these
are
the
ramifications
of
taking
these
people
from
so
many
states
and
so
many
of
them
and
bringing
them
all
together
in
one
state
oregon,
california,
washington
whatever
it
might
be
or
it
could
have
been
possibly
except
for
the
policy
defense
here,
it
could
have
been
montana.
so
it
isn’t
just
a
grant
or
denial
of
a
jury
trial.
it's
a
grant
or
denial
of
all
of
these
other
aspects
which
accompany
a
jury
trial
and
speaking
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
cause
and
i
feel
that
i
am
speaking
for
plaintiffs
in
the
louisiana
bus
accident
and
the
plaintiffs
in
the
grants
pass
oregon
accident.
interpleader
in
this
type
situation,
even
with
an
individual
jury
trial
for
each
party
injured,
if
through
interpleader
would
have
necessity
be
in
one
court
in
one
jurisdiction
and
would
cause
additional
expense
and
additional
delay.
mr.
james
griswold
no,
i
don’t
believe
that
i
would
approve
that
statement
your
honor.
the
interpleader
proceeding
means
that
everybody
is
brought
to
--
in
my
mind,
everybody
is
brought
to
one
court,
the
appropriate
restraining
orders
are
entered
preventing
them
from
doing
anything
other
than
in
that
court
and
if
in
this
case
by
their
complaint
if
it's
found
that
there
is
insurance
coverage
that
money
would
then
be
deposited
in
court
and
state
farm
will
then
walk
away.
this
of
course
is
what
they
want.
mr.
james
griswold
yes
that’s
correct,
(inaudible)
yes.
mr.
james
griswold
yes
and
there
this
is
additional
consequence
your
honor.
mr.
james
griswold
basically
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
griswold
well
the
question
your
honor
under
the
bill
hart
(ph)
case
is
whether
or
not
under
the
oregon
law
these
people
are
claimants.
mr.
james
griswold
well
its
claimants
who
are
claiming,
or
may
claim.
the
ninth
circuit
court
held
that
these
people
in
this
position
in
an
action
arising
out
of
tort
were
not
claimants
within
the
meaning
of
the
interpleader
act
because
they
could
not
be
claimants
against
this
petitioner
in
oregon
state
farm.
a
distinction
which
i
must
make
in
this
situation
is
the
duties
and
the
responsibilities
of
this
petitioner,
state
farm,
as
compared
to
the
duties
and
the
responsibilities
the
majority
of
the
interpleader
proceedings.
i'm
talking
about
the
life
insurance
companies,
i'm
talking
about
the
trust
companies,
the
bond
companies,
the
surety
broker,
bonds
on
broker
surety
bond.
in
these
situations
the
person
that
is
obligated
to
make
payment
of
money
has
only
one
obligation
and
that
is
to
pay
that
money
and
two
or
three
people
claim
that
from
him,
he
doesn't
know
which
way
to
turn
so
the
interpleader
statute
protects
him,
he
plays
into
court
in
that
ends
it.
state
farm
has
two
obligations
under
this
contract.
when
they
sell
this
insurance
policy,
they
have
several
hands
out
receiving
the
money.
this
comes
in
to
cover
the
cost
of
claims.
they
have
a
handout
to
cover
the
agency
premium.
also
included
in
this
is
the
hand
that
covers
the
cost
of
defense,
because
they
have
in
this
contract
the
duty
and
the
obligation
to
defend
all
the
lawsuits
brought
against
their
assurers.
now
selfishly
speaking
we
are
not
interested
as
to
whether
state
farm’s
assurers
are
by
protected
by
state
farm
or
not
on
the
face
of
it,
but
basically
we
are
when
there
is
a
limited
policy
as
here
--
mr.
james
griswold
that’s
true,
yes
it
does.
mr.
james
griswold
my
answer
is
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
the
only
qualifications
of
that
language
are
the
decisions
of
the
various
district
and
circuit
courts
which
are
cited
in
the
briefs.
some
of
these
courts
say
it
doesn't
apply
in
this
of
type
situation
others
have
said
that
it
does.
i
started
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
interest
we
do
have
in
state
farm
defending
its
insured,
it’s
assured
and
that
is
that
if
there
are
funds,
individual
funds
of
the
assured
and
actions
are
maintained
against
him,
without
the
insurance
defense
the
providing
of
a
defense
for
the
assured,
his
own
individual
funds
would
have
to
be
used
to
retain
counsel
and
court
cost
and
this
in
a
case
of
this
nature
would
becomes
substantial
and
any
funds
that
the
individual
defendant
might
have
which
would
normally
under
judgments
shall
i
say
be
available
to
the
injured
parties
would
be
spent
in
performing
a
duty,
which
we
feel
or
performing
the
function
of
defending
this
case
which
we
feel
is
the
duty
of
state
farm.
now
there
are
we
feel
--
mr.
james
griswold
state
farm
in
their
complaint
has
said
one
we
have
the
policy
defense.
they
have
said
we
don’t
feel
we
have
the
duty
to
defend
for
that
reason.
they
say
also
if
we
have
the
duty
and
if
there
is
liability
here
are
the
$20,000
we
would
like
to
be
relieved
of
the
duty
of
defending,
this
is
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
prayer.
mr.
james
griswold
to
my
knowledge
your
honor
the
insured
has
not
made
an
appearance
in
this
cause.
now
i
would
agree
--
i
would
think
he
would
be
most
unhappy.
he
is
--
he
is
left
completely
unprotected
if
this
were
to
happen.
mr.
james
griswold
no,
no.
this
matter
comes
to
this
court
very
early
in
the
pleading
stage.
the
restraining
order
was
entered.
greyhound
filed
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order
and
to
dismiss
the
action
and
then
withdrew
that
motion.
now
it
says
it
would
be
convenient
if
they
are
permitted
to
come
in.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order
and
to
dismiss.
this
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
courts’
opinion.
mr.
james
griswold
your
honor
i
don’t
believe
this
is
their
position,
i
think
their
position
is
that
they
have
right
to
interpleader
only
if
they
can
show.
mr.
james
griswold
the
claims
will
exceed
the
amount
of
the
policy
which
they
have
done
here.
mr.
james
griswold
well,
the
basic
purpose,
the
foundation
for
interpleader
is
to
remove
the
danger
to
the
petitioner
in
an
interpleader
proceeding
from
possibly
being
held
for
more
than
their
contractual
duty.
a
life
insurance
company,
a
suit
for
$
10,000
in
new
york
and
a
policy
in
10,000
in
california.
interpleader
permits
them
to
bring
both
people
in
one
court
and
they
only
have
to
pay
the
one
$
10,000.
this
is
one
of
the
primary
functions
of
interpleader
as
i
read
the
decisions
and
the
works
by
professor
chapman.
so
if
it
would
be
impossible
or
if
the
petitioner
and
interpleader
could
not
show
that
the
claims
exceed
the
amount
of
the
fund
if
i
may
use
that
expression,
i
don’t
believe
they
would
be
entitled
to
interpleader
at
all.
mr.
james
griswold
i
would
basically
say
no
it
has
not
been
frequent
up
to
now.
the
cases
are
sparse
on
this
point.
since
this
matter
has
come
into
our
office
there
have
now
been
three
involving
greyhound
only
and
yet
i
can’t
help
but
comment
that
i
see
in
the
paper
or
on
television
of
a
lady
that
caused
the
death
of
several
children
in
the
state
--
in
new
england,
i
don’t
recall
the
state.
i
think
there
was
also
a
school
bus
accident
with
several
injuries
and
i
believe
some
deaths
within
the
last
few
years
--
within
the
last
few
weeks.
i
think
as
we
grow
and
as
our
highways
fill
with
vehicles
that
carry
more
and
more
people
this
problem
will
become
more
and
more
common.
the
situation
we
face
here
is
an
attempt
to
develop
this
particular
law,
this
theory
or
rule
of
law
and
i
think
that
it’s
gone
beyond
bounds
already
and
i’m
thinking
of
the
case
as
presented
to
this
court
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae.
if
the
court
will
recall
the
contents,
this
would
indicate
that
greyhound
incorporated
owns
greyhound
lines
and
owns
an
insurance
company.
the
insurance
company
had
a
$
500,000
policy
on
greyhound
lines.
they
have
filed
a
similar
matter
with
it
being
a
single
vehicle
accident
that
happened
in
oregon.
i
can
see
as
indicated
in
brief
amicus
curiae
a
possibility
that
the
insurance
programs
as
they
might
develop
in
the
future
would
make
efforts
to
take
advantage
of
this
situation.
we
indicated
in
our
brief
that
if
interpleader
is
granted
there
would
appear
that
the
result
reached
in
travelers
indemnity
versus
greyhound
would
be
an
appropriate
relief.
this
is
a
limited
restraining
order
which
is
the
thing
that
shall
i
say
damages
or
hurts
the
injured
people
in
an
interpleader.
what
it
does
is
prevent
these
people
from
executing
on
judgments,
executing
against
the
insurance
carrier,
but
they
may
proceed
as
they
wish
to
obtain
these
judgments.
mr.
james
griswold
no
it
would
not.
mr.
james
griswold
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
of
course
when
you
asked
would
it
relived
his
duty
to
defend
i
asked
--
mr.
james
griswold
no
i
don’t
mean
this
your
honor.
i
ask
whether
or
not
under
that
policy
he
has
any
right
to
be
relived
of
that
duty.
this
is
the
question
that
i
ask
and
i
submit
no,
that
he
is
duty
bound
that
he
cannot
take
advantage
of
this
situation,
at
least
he
assured
on
his
own
and
avoid
the
defense
of
these
cases.
mr.
james
griswold
my
answer
has
to
be
yes.
mr.
james
griswold
my
answer
has
to
yes.
i
don’t
like
the
expression
sky
is
the
limit,
but
my
answer
is
yes
to
that
question.
this
is
their
obligation.
this
is
should
if
it
is
not
now,
it
should
be
build
into
their
premium
rating
system
because
we
can
reach
a
point
here
your
honor
where
whenever
we
have
an
out
of
state
insurance
carrier
involved
in
accident
with
two
or
three
people
in
an
automobile,
immediately
we
are
an
interpleader.
we
get
back
to
my
question
of
a
jury
trial.
the
convenience
of
the
party,
this
happens
in
oregon
interpleader’s
filed
in
oregon.
we
get
back
to
our
jury
trial
and
whether
or
not
under
the
interpleader
system.
of
course
the
signal
oil
case
is
cited
in
petitioner’s
brief
indicates
fairly
that
there
is
no
jury
trial
authorized
in
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
because
it
is
an
equity,
but
assume
that,
that
rule
is
modified
by
this
court
in
this
matter,
still
i
question
whether
it
would
be
in
fact
the
jury
trial
is
guaranteed
by
our
oregon
constitution.
i
have
just
a
very
few
moments
left
that
might
be
the
court
if
there
are
any
other
questions
that
i’ve
not
answered
or
not
touched
on.
mr.
james
griswold
in
interpleader
yes
and
this
is
what’s
happened
in
all
three
of
these
greyhound
cases
rather,
the
answer
is
yes,
they
have
done.
i
see
my
time
is
up
thank
you
very
much.
