mr.
nick
chaivoe
mr.
skopil
has
completed
his
argument
your
honor.
my
name
is
nick
chaivoe
for
the
respondent.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
skopil
indicated
in
his
opening
argument
the
two
primary
problems
involved
here
and
which
i
am
going
to
discuss
the
question
of
jurisdiction
which
is
two-pronged.
one
is
question
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
this
suit,
and
secondly
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
persons.
it
is
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case
that
whether
or
not
the
persons
injured
in
the
greyhound
bus,
the
35
persons
who
were
injured
in
the
greyhound
bus
as
a
result
of
this
accident
had
a
right
to
proceed
against
the
insurance
carriers
under
the
case
of
brillhart
versus
excess
insurance
companymust
be
decided
according
to
the
laws
of
the
state
and
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
state
of
oregon
as
stated
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
no
direct
action
statute
permitting
a
cause
of
action
to
be
brought
against
the
insurance
carriers
until
after
judgment,
that
is
judgment
against
the
person
carrying
the
coverage.
furthermore
the
statute
state
of
oregon
is
even
more
restrictive.
there
are
two
statutes
oregon
revised
statute
23230
which
states
that
only
after
judgment
is
secured
against
the
assured
may
the
individual
then
proceed
against
the
insurance
carrier.
the
second
statute
730
ors
736.320
sets
forth
that
bankruptcy
does
not
relieve
the
insurance
carrier
of
its
responsibility.
that
after
judgment
is
unsatisfied
for
30
days
then
the
person
securing
the
judgment
may
proceed
against
the
insurance
carrier.
these
are
the
only
two
statutes
in
the
state
of
oregon
committing
recovery
against
an
insurance
company
arising
out
of
a
casualty
of
this
nature.
we
submit
then
that
based
upon
the
laws
in
state
of
oregon
there
is
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
here.
the
injured
persons
in
the
greyhound
bus
are
not
claimants
under
the
interpleader
statute
1335.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
please
the
court,
i
have
clients
in
los
angeles,
in
california
one
is
a
paraplegic
who
was
unable
to
move
without
attendants
who
would
have
to
be
required
come
from
california
to
oregon
in
order
to
have
his
matter
tried
before
the
court.
i
have
a
client
in
montana,
who
would
have
to
come
from
montana
in
order
to
have
this
case
tried
in
oregon.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
we
have
moved
for
a
change
of
venue
your
honor,
but
that
point
has
never
been
reached
by
the
oregon
district
court
because
of
the
district
court’s
position
on
the
restraining
order.
we
filed
a
interlocutory
appeal
under
1292
(b)
and
the
circuit
court
then
took
jurisdiction
on
this
matter
has
--
has
since
come
up
as
a
result
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
question
of
venue
has
never
been
argued
in
the
oregon
courts.
the
court
in
oregon
feeling
that
before
they
proceeded
any
further
in
this
matter
we
should
wait
for
the
final
determination
of
the
whether
or
not
interpleader
would
like.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
your
honor
we
foresee
one,
the
denial
of
right
of
trial
by
jury.
as
far
as
we
can
determine
--
mr.
nick
chaivoe
this
is
a
matter
in
equity
your
honor
and
we
believe
that
once
equity
takes
jurisdiction
over
the
case
that
there
is
no
right
of
trial
by
jury
traditionally
in
equity.
the
interpleader
statute
thus
has
not
have
provision
for
trial
by
jury
and
i
believe
there
is
one
case
and
i
am
not
certain
the
exact
title,
signal
oil
case
which
i
believe
supports
my
position
that
once
in
equity,
no
right
of
trial
by
jury
exists.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
this
is
our
interpretation
of
what
would
occur
your
honor.
we
have,
we’d
have
a
mass
trial
of
35
persons
claims
perhaps
40
persons
if
we
include
the
bus
driver
and
the
driver
or
the
owner
of
the
pick
up
truck,
its
somewhere
between
35
to
40
persons
involved
in
one
mass
trial
without
a
trial
by
jury
without
the
individual
damages
of
each
person
being
presented
as
we
feel
to
a
jury
and
we
feel
should
have
a
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
jury
under
the
united
states
constitution
and
under
constitution
of
state
of
oregon.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
yes
your
honor,
i
see
not
to
my
own
clients.
i
do
see
--
mr.
nick
chaivoe
relative
to
people
in
my
--
in
this
particular
case
i
do
see
however
a
tremendous
danger
to
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
in
all
multiple
injury
cases
in
the
future
where
the
injuries
might
exceed
the
policy
limits
that
the
insurance
carrier
has.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
we
have
cause
of
action
against
clark,
the
driver
of
pick
up
truck.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
the
insured
of
insured
of
state
farm.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
yes
your
honor
and
again
we
also
feel
we
have
a
case
course
of
action
against
greyhound
lines,
now
this
is
other
portion.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
because
greyhound
has
been
joined
interpleader
action
your
honor
and
they
have
also
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
restraining
us
from
proceeding
with
any
cause
of
action
in
any
court
in
the
united
states
against
greyhound
or
their
driver
nauta.
we
are
in
position
where
we
can't
do
a
thing.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
if
the
court
allows
greyhound’s
petition
to
be
involved
to
stay
within
the
interpleader
which
is
what
they
have
petitioned
for
to
go
along
with
state
farm
to
have
their
cause
determined
at
the
same
time,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
nick
chaivoe
your
honor
they
have
stated
all
proceeding
with
this
across
they
even
has
against
greyhound.
in
this
case
they
have
stayed
all
proceedings
against
greyhound
as
well
as
against
clark.
we
can't
we
–
under
the
order
of
district
court
of
state
of
oregon.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
he
has
not
indicated
which
way
he
is
going
to
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
original
trial
judge
is
no
longer
sitting
your
honor.
he
has
resigned
from
the
bench
and
we
have
not
been
before
any
other
court,
any
other
judge
on
this
matter
up
to
that
time
judge
kenny
(ph)
has
heard
a
few
matters,
but
he
has
held
everything
in
abeyance
until
this
court
makes
its
final
decision.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
judge
hughes,
your
honor.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
yes
your
honor
that
might
be.
california
and
washington
both
have
unlimited
recovery
of
wrongful
deaths.
oregon
has
a
$25000
limitation.
had
the
cases
brought
to
oregon
the
chances
are
that
the
court
might
apply
the
law
of
state
of
oregon
as
a
measure
of
damage
rather
than
the
law
of
state
of
california.
that
certainly
be
the
difference
the
amount
of
recovery
to
be
had.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
$25000
yes
your
honor.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
as
to
greyhound
lines
we
might,
not
as
to
state
farm
which
has
limited
policy.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
get
to
plead
the
file
in
california
where
many
most
of
the
cases
that
have
been
filed
are
filed
there
will
be
unlimited
recovery
in
death
case.
mr.
nick
chaivoe
your
honor
we
had
the
restraining
order
lifted
for
the
purpose
of
being
allowed
to
file
in
order
to
toll
the
statute
limitations
of
california
which
had
only
one
year
statue.
so
the
cases
are
filed,
but
we
are
limited
from
proceeding
in
the
court.
we
can't
go
no
further
with
the
cases.
i
see
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
mr.
griswold
and
i
split
our
time
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court
i
will
allow
mr.

to
proceed.
