justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
these
people
at
least
theoretically
have
a
cause
of
action
against
greyhound
and
what
you're
doing
is
to
foreclose
them
from
suing
greyhound
in
some
other
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
if
so
what
happens?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
should
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
not
sure
sir
that
i
quite
understand
your
theory
then
as
to
what
the
interpleader
statute
means.
is
it
your
theory
that
the
interpleader
statute
means
that
in
this
case
state
life
couldn’t
deposit
the
principal
of
its
policy
in
a
court
and
that
judgment
could
not
be
obtained
against
state
life
in
any
other
court,
although
the
plaintiffs
would
be
free
to
bring
their
actions
in
any
other
court
and
i
have
to
say
that.
is
that
your
theory
of
what
it
means?
justice
abe
fortas
money
is
deposited
at
the
outset,
isn’t
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now
well
if
that
is
so
then
what
you’re
telling
us
is
that
all
of
these
consequences
that
you
believe
to
be
adverse,
follow
on
necessity
once
it
is
determined
that
state
life
may
bring
a
proper
interpleader
action.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
there
no
--
is
what
i
say
here
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
if
that
is
so
then
how
do
you
dispose
of
the
language
in
the
interpleader
statute
saying
that
two
or
more
adverse
claimants
--
saying
that
an
interpleader
action
maybe
brought
where
two
or
more
adverse
claimants
et
cetera
are
claiming
or
may
claim
to
be
entitled
to
such
money
and
property?
justice
abe
fortas
may
be
claimants.
justice
abe
fortas
the
problem
there
is,
since
it
mirrors
some
section
or
sub
section
(a)
of
the
interpleader
statute
expressly
lists
policy
of
insurance?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
or
elsewhere
that
qualifies
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
represent
greyhound,
don’t
you
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
mr.
clark
cannot
been
insured
here
greyhound
could
have
been
sued
by
these
plaintiffs,
by
these
plaintiffs
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
are
not
the,
the
greyhound
though
is
not
insured
by
state
life?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what’s
happening
here
is
that
as
a
result
of
the
circumstance
the
state
life
insured
mr.
clark.
greyhound
a
stranger
to
that
transaction
is
receiving
benefit,
you
maybe
entitled
to
it,
i
am
not
suggesting
you
are
not,
but
however
that
maybe
your
receiving
the
benefit
of
this
single
trial
in
a
forum
selected
by
state
life?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
just
might
be,
now
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
here
if
i
may.
why
does
state
life
have
to
bring
the
action
where
it
can
obtain
personal
service
on
clark.
i
thought
the
interpleader
statute
–
that
an
interpleader
action
could
be
filed
wherever
one
of
the,
or
more
of
the
claimants
resides?
justice
abe
fortas
well
until
that
question
is
decided
i
suppose
there
is
an
additional
problem
here
as
to
whether
there
are
any
adverse
claimants?
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
not
saying
that
that’s
what
the
insurance
company
says
and
you
just
repeat
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well
let
me
ask
you
just
one
more
question
and
i’ll
leave
you
alone.
do
you
agree
that
this
case
would
go
to
trial
without
a
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
would
the
individuals,
well
would
there
be
individual
trials
here?
