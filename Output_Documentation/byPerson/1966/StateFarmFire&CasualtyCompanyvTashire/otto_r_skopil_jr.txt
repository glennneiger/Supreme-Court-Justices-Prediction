mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
company,
the
original
plaintiff
in
the
case,
which
was
filed
under
section
1335
of
the
code
as
a
bill
in
the
nature
of
interpleader.
just
by
way
of
brief
background
i
think
the
complaint,
which
is
a
part
of
the
record
reveals
most
of
these
facts.
that
mr.
glasgow,
one
of
the
named
defendants
in
the
original
complaint
was
the
owner
of
a
certain
pickup
automobile,
which
he
used
in
his
own
business
to
travel
to
the
san
francisco,
california
area
from
medford,
oregon
for
the
purpose
of
picking
up
furniture
at
auction
sales
and
then
returning
to
the
medford
area,
his
home
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
such
merchandise.
mr.
glasgow
was
not
insured.
he
had
no
insurance,
no
liability
insurance
coverage
on
his
vehicle.
mr.
clark
one
of
the
other
main
defendants
who
is
the
insured
of
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
company,
as
a
friend
of
mr.
glasgow
was
invited
to
go
along
on
the
particular
trip
to
san
francisco,
mr.
clark
at
that
time
being
unemployed
and
proceeded
to
travel
with
mr.
glasgow.
at
a
point
some
distance
north
of
redding,
mr.
glasgow,
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
asked
mr.
clark,
the
state
farm
insured
whether
or
not
he
wouldn't
drive
the
vehicle
for
a
period
of
time.
mr.
clark
honoring
such
request
commenced
to
drive
the
vehicle
and
shortly
after
he
undertook
this
responsibility,
there
was
a
collision
which
occurred
between
the
glasgow
vehicle
been
driven
by
mr.
clark
and
a
pacific
greyhound
bus,
such
accident
having
occurred
from
all
of
the
investigation
on
what
would
be
the
greyhound
side
of
the
road
and
not
the
clark
side
of
the
road.
glasgow
has
no
insurance.
mr.
clark
is
insured
with
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
company
with
a
total
coverage
applicable
to
this
situation
of
$20,000.
shortly
after
that
the
lawsuits
are
beginning
to
be
filed
and
after
the
first
five
have
been
filed,
the
total
tort
relief
exceeds
a
million
dollars,
a
million
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
dollars.
there
were
some
37
claimants,
35
passengers
in
the
bus,
and
the
bus
actually
traveled
over
an
embankment
and
as
a
result
the
injuries
were
rather
severe
in
some
instances
and
i
think
three
deaths
as
a
result
of
the
particular
collision.
so
state
farm
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
against
mr.
clark,
mr.
glasgow
and
greyhound.
one
correction
i'd
like
to
make
your
honor
and
that
is
the
claimants
are
not
only
the
passengers
of
the
bus,
but
they
also
of
course
include
mr.
glasgow
who
is
a
passenger
in
his
own
vehicle.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
and
also
pacific
greyhound
lines,
who
of
course,
this
claim
might
be
remote
but
they
do
claim
a
right
to
the
proceeds
which
they
were
required
to
pay
to
their
own
employee
mr.
nauta,
the
driver
of
the
bus
and
they
also
claim
damage
to
their
personal
property,
the
damage
to
the
bus
itself.
so
the
parties,
all
parties
except
clark
were
named
as
defendants
because
they
are
claimants
to
the
farm,
which
of
course
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
has,
by
virtue
of
the
policy,
which
it
had
issued.
so
the
two
questions
which
are
raised,
one
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes
the
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
we
admit
liability
â€“
we
can't
admit
liability
on
the
part
of
the
mr.
clark
of
course
are
insured
but
we
do
tendered
the
$20,000
in
the
court
and
it
is
deposit,
has
been
on
the
deposit
with
the
registry
of
the
court
since
january
1965,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes,
our
tender
in
the
court
is
based
upon
on
the
condition
that
there's
coverage
extended
to
mr.
clark
and
the
reason
for
that
question
and
the
reason
that
the
action
is
brought
in
the
nature
of
the
bill
and
interpleader
is
this.
as
i've
indicated,
mr.
glasgow
was
the
owner
of
the
vehicle,
which
was
been
driven
by
mr.
clark.
the
vehicle
was
being
operated
in
another
person's
business
namely
mr.
glasgow's
business.
so
one
of
the
exclusion
of
all
of
our
policies,
if
you're
operating
a
non-owned
automobile
in
the
business
of
another
it
comes
within
exclusion
under
your
policy,
you
know,
just
as,
if
i
were
driving
laundry
truck
for
a
certain
laundry
company.
my
coverage
will
not
apply
while
i
was
operating
a
non-owned
vehicle
in
somebody
else's
business.
so
that's
the
basis
for
the
coverage
question
and
that's
the
reason
of
course
that
mr.
clark
is
named
in
the
situation
because
we
do
have
a
contractual
question
between
mr.
clark
and
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
under
the
coverage
question.
now,
the
two
questions
which
i've
really
been
raised
and
the
ones,
which
state
farm
is
concerned
there
have
been
some
side
issues
raised
as
the
result
of
greyhound
having
been
named
as
a
party
defendant,
which
i
feel
have
no
bearing
on
the
questions
which
are
actually
before
the
court.
the
first
issue
of
course
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
itself.
i
think
the
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
will
reveal
that
they
indicated
that
the
action
and
nature
of
interpleader
must
be
dismissed
for
lack
for
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
so
that
is
the
first
question
which
has
been
raised
and
was
not
a
question
actually
upon
which
this
matter
was
appealed
in
the
ninth
circuit
but
was
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit
after
a
consideration
of
the
case.
the
second
issue
and
i'll
deal
with
them
separately
consist
of
whether
or
not
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
canadian
residents.
11
of
the
passengers
in
the
greyhound
bus
were
canadian
residents,
so
that
question
has
been
raised
and
was
the
question
that
actually
this
matter
went
down
to
the
ninth
circuit
on.
first,
with
reference
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
as
i've
indicated,
we
rely
on
the
provisions
of
section
1335
of
the
code
which
actually
really
requires
three
jurisdictional
facts
as
i
read
that
particular
provision.
first
of
all,
it
requires
a
person,
firm
or
a
corporation
who
has
in
his
custody
money
or
property
of
the
value
of
$500
or
more
or
having
issued
a
policy
of
insurance
in
the
value
of
an
amount
of
$500
or
more.
in
this
situation
as
i've
indicated,
there's
an
insurance
policy
issued
in
the
amount
of
$20,000
coverage
for
this
particular
incident.
secondly,
the
diversity
of
citizenship
for
the
claimants
as
defined
in
the
statute
of
1335
and
you'll
note
that
a
reading
of
that
statute
actually
defines
the
diversity
of
citizenship
as
being
that
referred
to
in
section
1332
and
of
course
we
have
that
situation
in
our
case.
there
were
11
canadian
subjects,
there
were
10
washington
residents,
there
were
9
oregon
residents,
there
were
7
california
residents
and
i
think
1
montana
resident
and
a
south
or
north
dakota
resident.
so
actually
we
come
within
the
third
subdivision
of
section
1332
and
that
is
subdivision
three
of
subsection
a,
and
that
is
citizens
of
different
states
and
in
which
foreign
states
or
citizens
or
subjects
thereof
are
additional
parties.
so
we
have
the
diversity
of
citizenship
in
that
each
of
the
claimants
or
i
should
say
that
the
claimants
are
diverse
in
citizenship
and
as
indicated,
we
have
canadians,
we
have
--
people
from
the
state
of
washington,
people
from
the
state
of
oregon,
california
and
two
other
states
montana
and
south
dakota.
so
the
diversity
of
citizenship
is
obviously
present
which
is
required
under
the
provisions
of
1335
as
defined
in
1332.
the
third
requirement
of
course
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
right.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
no,
diverse
from
each
other.
all
it's
required
is
that
the
claimants
be
diverse
from
one
another.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
right,
correct.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
no,
there
just
has
to
be
diversity
and
that
there
has
to
be
a
diversity
between
claimants
but
not
complete
diversity.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
state
farm,
now
i
can't
speak
for
geryhound,
the
state
farm
is
an
illinois
corporation
and
of
course
authorized
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
oregon
and
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
perhaps
i
think
1397
just
answers
the
question
which
has
been
asked
by
your
honor
because
it
says
in
any
civil
action
of
interpleader
or
in
the
nature
of
interpleader
under
section
1335
of
this
title
maybe
brought
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
one
or
more
of
the
claimants
reside.
now,
the
venue
situation
perhaps
i
think
i'm
sure
that
there
has
been
some
mention
made
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
this
fact
that
is
that
we're
trying
to
go
for
money,
which
of
course
as
far
as
state
farm
is
concerned
we're
only
interested
in
getting
our
$20,000
in
the
court.
if
we
owe
the
money
that
the
property
or
the
bundle
may
distributed
inequitable
distribution
to
each
of
the
claimants
that
the
multiplicity
of
suits
will
be
eliminated
and
that
of
course
double
vexation
will
be
eliminated.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well
that
has
been
the
result
and
of
course
i
think
the
purpose,
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
the
purpose
behind
section
1335
and
i
think
this
has
been,
i
think
fairly
clearly
stated
by
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes,
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
no,
we
couldn't
do
that.
we
have
a
--
mr.
clark
is
an
oregon
resident;
the
insured
is
an
oregon
resident.
the
policy
is
issued
in
the
state
of
oregon.
state
farm,
i
think
would
be
compelled
to
bring
this
action
in
the
state
of
oregon
because
we'd
have
to
obtain
personal
service
upon
mr.
clark
in
the
state
in
which
he
resides
and
this
was
the
only
place
that
we
could
obtain
the
service.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes,
because
of
the
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
if
it
didn't
challenge
the
coverage,
then
i
think
we
could
bring
it
in
any
one
of
the
states
in
which
any
of
the
claimants
reside
as
long
as
there
were
claimants
in
other
states.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
the
question
of
multiple
liability
i
think
is
a
--
if
i've
to
answer
the
question,
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
first
to
eliminate
multiplicity
of
actions,
to
allow
for
an
equitable
distribution
of
the
fund.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
i
think
the
courts
have
said
this,
yes.
i
think
there's
double
vexation
in
this
particular
case
because
of
course
if
greyhound
were
sued
particularly
in
the
state
of
california
and
a
judgment
was
obtained
against
greyhound,
they
certainly
would
have
a
right
of
contribution
back
against
the
fund
of
the
insurance
company
as
a
result
of
having
insured
mr.
clark.
so
i
think
certainly
there's
also
double
vexation
in
this
situation.
the
fact
that
there
are
adverse
claimants,
i
think
that
probably
judge
dillon
in
the
adams
case
which
has
been
refer
to
probably
best
states
it,
which
he
says
it
might
by
the
same
reasoning
we
said
that
a
100
persons
that
adrift
in
the
ocean
with
but
one
small
lifeboat
in
sight
were
not
adverse
to
each
other.
we
fear
however
that
the
concept
of
non-adversity
would
dwindle
in
direct
proportion
to
the
number
of
swimmers
reaching
the
boat,
and
certainly
that's
the
situation
we
have
here.
we
have
37
claimants
all
of
them
want
the
$20,000
and
all
go
adverse
to
one
another
and
all
we're
really
asking
in
this
situation
is
that
the
court
entertain
jurisdiction
in
the
nature
of
interpleader
so
that
they
will
eliminate
of
multiplicity
of
suits,
eliminate
double
vexation
and
that
there
will
be
an
equable
apportionment
of
the
fund
among
the
claimants.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
this
is
one
of
the
questions,
which
i
think
probably
the
court
is
aware
of
by
virtue
of
the
amicus
curiae
brief
principally.
now,
i
think
certainly
with
the
power
and
authority
that
has
been
given
to
the,
to
our
district
judges
under
the
federal
procedure
that
they
certainly
have
wide
power
to
either
segregate
issues,
consolidate
issues
and
certainly
they
are
entitled
to
jury
trial.
we
are
not
in
anyway
inferring
that
the
claimants
in
the
situation
are
not
entitled
to
a
jury
a
trial.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
if
you're
going
to
follow
the
interpleader
situation
in
order
to
have
an
orderly
administration
of
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
is
going
to
assume
jurisdiction
under
interpleader,
the
purposes
to
eliminate
multiplicity
of
action
to
provide
for
a
uniform
reasonable
apportionment
of
the
fund.
so
i
think
we're
trying
to
eliminate
the
35
lawsuits
as
well,
it
amounts
to
minimum
35
lawsuits
and
to
do
this
we
feel
that
the,
of
course
that
the
district
court
has
power
to
do
this
and
should
have
this
power.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
that's
not
our
intent
at
all
your
honor.
it's
not
our
intent
at
all.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
i
think
we,
state
farm
happens
to
the
apparently
struck
the
wrong
individual
greyhound.
if
greyhound
were
not
a
solvent
corporation
and
the
possibility
of
recovery
against
them
would
not
be
as
great
as
the
plaintiffs
apparently
think
it
is
and
i
know
nothing
about
greyhound
situation,
i'm
sure
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
the
remedy
should
be
determined
by
who
the
parties
are
involved,
these
are
the
--
remedy
is
good
or
as
not
good
as
far
as
the
situation
is
concerned.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
company,
the
original
plaintiff
in
the
case,
which
was
filed
under
section
1335
of
the
code
as
a
bill
in
the
nature
of
interpleader.
just
by
way
of
brief
background
i
think
the
complaint,
which
is
a
part
of
the
record
reveals
most
of
these
facts.
that
mr.
glasgow,
one
of
the
named
defendants
in
the
original
complaint
was
the
owner
of
a
certain
pickup
automobile,
which
he
used
in
his
own
business
to
travel
to
the
san
francisco,
california
area
from
medford,
oregon
for
the
purpose
of
picking
up
furniture
at
auction
sales
and
then
returning
to
the
medford
area,
his
home
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
such
merchandise.
mr.
glasgow
was
not
insured.
he
had
no
insurance,
no
liability
insurance
coverage
on
his
vehicle.
mr.
clark
one
of
the
other
main
defendants
who
is
the
insured
of
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
company,
as
a
friend
of
mr.
glasgow
was
invited
to
go
along
on
the
particular
trip
to
san
francisco,
mr.
clark
at
that
time
being
unemployed
and
proceeded
to
travel
with
mr.
glasgow.
at
a
point
some
distance
north
of
redding,
mr.
glasgow,
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
asked
mr.
clark,
the
state
farm
insured
whether
or
not
he
wouldn't
drive
the
vehicle
for
a
period
of
time.
mr.
clark
honoring
such
request
commenced
to
drive
the
vehicle
and
shortly
after
he
undertook
this
responsibility,
there
was
a
collision
which
occurred
between
the
glasgow
vehicle
been
driven
by
mr.
clark
and
a
pacific
greyhound
bus,
such
accident
having
occurred
from
all
of
the
investigation
on
what
would
be
the
greyhound
side
of
the
road
and
not
the
clark
side
of
the
road.
glasgow
has
no
insurance.
mr.
clark
is
insured
with
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
company
with
a
total
coverage
applicable
to
this
situation
of
$20,000.
shortly
after
that
the
lawsuits
are
beginning
to
be
filed
and
after
the
first
five
have
been
filed,
the
total
tort
relief
exceeds
a
million
dollars,
a
million
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
dollars.
there
were
some
37
claimants,
35
passengers
in
the
bus,
and
the
bus
actually
traveled
over
an
embankment
and
as
a
result
the
injuries
were
rather
severe
in
some
instances
and
i
think
three
deaths
as
a
result
of
the
particular
collision.
so
state
farm
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
against
mr.
clark,
mr.
glasgow
and
greyhound.
one
correction
i'd
like
to
make
your
honor
and
that
is
the
claimants
are
not
only
the
passengers
of
the
bus,
but
they
also
of
course
include
mr.
glasgow
who
is
a
passenger
in
his
own
vehicle.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
and
also
pacific
greyhound
lines,
who
of
course,
this
claim
might
be
remote
but
they
do
claim
a
right
to
the
proceeds
which
they
were
required
to
pay
to
their
own
employee
mr.
nauta,
the
driver
of
the
bus
and
they
also
claim
damage
to
their
personal
property,
the
damage
to
the
bus
itself.
so
the
parties,
all
parties
except
clark
were
named
as
defendants
because
they
are
claimants
to
the
farm,
which
of
course
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
has,
by
virtue
of
the
policy,
which
it
had
issued.
so
the
two
questions
which
are
raised,
one
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes
the
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
we
admit
liability
â€“
we
can't
admit
liability
on
the
part
of
the
mr.
clark
of
course
are
insured
but
we
do
tendered
the
$20,000
in
the
court
and
it
is
deposit,
has
been
on
the
deposit
with
the
registry
of
the
court
since
january
1965,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes,
our
tender
in
the
court
is
based
upon
on
the
condition
that
there's
coverage
extended
to
mr.
clark
and
the
reason
for
that
question
and
the
reason
that
the
action
is
brought
in
the
nature
of
the
bill
and
interpleader
is
this.
as
i've
indicated,
mr.
glasgow
was
the
owner
of
the
vehicle,
which
was
been
driven
by
mr.
clark.
the
vehicle
was
being
operated
in
another
person's
business
namely
mr.
glasgow's
business.
so
one
of
the
exclusion
of
all
of
our
policies,
if
you're
operating
a
non-owned
automobile
in
the
business
of
another
it
comes
within
exclusion
under
your
policy,
you
know,
just
as,
if
i
were
driving
laundry
truck
for
a
certain
laundry
company.
my
coverage
will
not
apply
while
i
was
operating
a
non-owned
vehicle
in
somebody
else's
business.
so
that's
the
basis
for
the
coverage
question
and
that's
the
reason
of
course
that
mr.
clark
is
named
in
the
situation
because
we
do
have
a
contractual
question
between
mr.
clark
and
state
farm
fire
and
casualty
under
the
coverage
question.
now,
the
two
questions
which
i've
really
been
raised
and
the
ones,
which
state
farm
is
concerned
there
have
been
some
side
issues
raised
as
the
result
of
greyhound
having
been
named
as
a
party
defendant,
which
i
feel
have
no
bearing
on
the
questions
which
are
actually
before
the
court.
the
first
issue
of
course
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
itself.
i
think
the
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
will
reveal
that
they
indicated
that
the
action
and
nature
of
interpleader
must
be
dismissed
for
lack
for
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
so
that
is
the
first
question
which
has
been
raised
and
was
not
a
question
actually
upon
which
this
matter
was
appealed
in
the
ninth
circuit
but
was
the
ruling
of
the
ninth
circuit
after
a
consideration
of
the
case.
the
second
issue
and
i'll
deal
with
them
separately
consist
of
whether
or
not
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
canadian
residents.
11
of
the
passengers
in
the
greyhound
bus
were
canadian
residents,
so
that
question
has
been
raised
and
was
the
question
that
actually
this
matter
went
down
to
the
ninth
circuit
on.
first,
with
reference
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
as
i've
indicated,
we
rely
on
the
provisions
of
section
1335
of
the
code
which
actually
really
requires
three
jurisdictional
facts
as
i
read
that
particular
provision.
first
of
all,
it
requires
a
person,
firm
or
a
corporation
who
has
in
his
custody
money
or
property
of
the
value
of
$500
or
more
or
having
issued
a
policy
of
insurance
in
the
value
of
an
amount
of
$500
or
more.
in
this
situation
as
i've
indicated,
there's
an
insurance
policy
issued
in
the
amount
of
$20,000
coverage
for
this
particular
incident.
secondly,
the
diversity
of
citizenship
for
the
claimants
as
defined
in
the
statute
of
1335
and
you'll
note
that
a
reading
of
that
statute
actually
defines
the
diversity
of
citizenship
as
being
that
referred
to
in
section
1332
and
of
course
we
have
that
situation
in
our
case.
there
were
11
canadian
subjects,
there
were
10
washington
residents,
there
were
9
oregon
residents,
there
were
7
california
residents
and
i
think
1
montana
resident
and
a
south
or
north
dakota
resident.
so
actually
we
come
within
the
third
subdivision
of
section
1332
and
that
is
subdivision
three
of
subsection
a,
and
that
is
citizens
of
different
states
and
in
which
foreign
states
or
citizens
or
subjects
thereof
are
additional
parties.
so
we
have
the
diversity
of
citizenship
in
that
each
of
the
claimants
or
i
should
say
that
the
claimants
are
diverse
in
citizenship
and
as
indicated,
we
have
canadians,
we
have
--
people
from
the
state
of
washington,
people
from
the
state
of
oregon,
california
and
two
other
states
montana
and
south
dakota.
so
the
diversity
of
citizenship
is
obviously
present
which
is
required
under
the
provisions
of
1335
as
defined
in
1332.
the
third
requirement
of
course
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
right.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
no,
diverse
from
each
other.
all
it's
required
is
that
the
claimants
be
diverse
from
one
another.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
right,
correct.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
no,
there
just
has
to
be
diversity
and
that
there
has
to
be
a
diversity
between
claimants
but
not
complete
diversity.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
state
farm,
now
i
can't
speak
for
geryhound,
the
state
farm
is
an
illinois
corporation
and
of
course
authorized
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
oregon
and
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
perhaps
i
think
1397
just
answers
the
question
which
has
been
asked
by
your
honor
because
it
says
in
any
civil
action
of
interpleader
or
in
the
nature
of
interpleader
under
section
1335
of
this
title
maybe
brought
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
one
or
more
of
the
claimants
reside.
now,
the
venue
situation
perhaps
i
think
i'm
sure
that
there
has
been
some
mention
made
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
this
fact
that
is
that
we're
trying
to
go
for
money,
which
of
course
as
far
as
state
farm
is
concerned
we're
only
interested
in
getting
our
$20,000
in
the
court.
if
we
owe
the
money
that
the
property
or
the
bundle
may
distributed
inequitable
distribution
to
each
of
the
claimants
that
the
multiplicity
of
suits
will
be
eliminated
and
that
of
course
double
vexation
will
be
eliminated.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well
that
has
been
the
result
and
of
course
i
think
the
purpose,
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
the
purpose
behind
section
1335
and
i
think
this
has
been,
i
think
fairly
clearly
stated
by
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes,
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
no,
we
couldn't
do
that.
we
have
a
--
mr.
clark
is
an
oregon
resident;
the
insured
is
an
oregon
resident.
the
policy
is
issued
in
the
state
of
oregon.
state
farm,
i
think
would
be
compelled
to
bring
this
action
in
the
state
of
oregon
because
we'd
have
to
obtain
personal
service
upon
mr.
clark
in
the
state
in
which
he
resides
and
this
was
the
only
place
that
we
could
obtain
the
service.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
yes,
because
of
the
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
if
it
didn't
challenge
the
coverage,
then
i
think
we
could
bring
it
in
any
one
of
the
states
in
which
any
of
the
claimants
reside
as
long
as
there
were
claimants
in
other
states.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
the
question
of
multiple
liability
i
think
is
a
--
if
i've
to
answer
the
question,
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
first
to
eliminate
multiplicity
of
actions,
to
allow
for
an
equitable
distribution
of
the
fund.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
i
think
the
courts
have
said
this,
yes.
i
think
there's
double
vexation
in
this
particular
case
because
of
course
if
greyhound
were
sued
particularly
in
the
state
of
california
and
a
judgment
was
obtained
against
greyhound,
they
certainly
would
have
a
right
of
contribution
back
against
the
fund
of
the
insurance
company
as
a
result
of
having
insured
mr.
clark.
so
i
think
certainly
there's
also
double
vexation
in
this
situation.
the
fact
that
there
are
adverse
claimants,
i
think
that
probably
judge
dillon
in
the
adams
case
which
has
been
refer
to
probably
best
states
it,
which
he
says
it
might
by
the
same
reasoning
we
said
that
a
100
persons
that
adrift
in
the
ocean
with
but
one
small
lifeboat
in
sight
were
not
adverse
to
each
other.
we
fear
however
that
the
concept
of
non-adversity
would
dwindle
in
direct
proportion
to
the
number
of
swimmers
reaching
the
boat,
and
certainly
that's
the
situation
we
have
here.
we
have
37
claimants
all
of
them
want
the
$20,000
and
all
go
adverse
to
one
another
and
all
we're
really
asking
in
this
situation
is
that
the
court
entertain
jurisdiction
in
the
nature
of
interpleader
so
that
they
will
eliminate
of
multiplicity
of
suits,
eliminate
double
vexation
and
that
there
will
be
an
equable
apportionment
of
the
fund
among
the
claimants.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
this
is
one
of
the
questions,
which
i
think
probably
the
court
is
aware
of
by
virtue
of
the
amicus
curiae
brief
principally.
now,
i
think
certainly
with
the
power
and
authority
that
has
been
given
to
the,
to
our
district
judges
under
the
federal
procedure
that
they
certainly
have
wide
power
to
either
segregate
issues,
consolidate
issues
and
certainly
they
are
entitled
to
jury
trial.
we
are
not
in
anyway
inferring
that
the
claimants
in
the
situation
are
not
entitled
to
a
jury
a
trial.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
if
you're
going
to
follow
the
interpleader
situation
in
order
to
have
an
orderly
administration
of
--
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
is
going
to
assume
jurisdiction
under
interpleader,
the
purposes
to
eliminate
multiplicity
of
action
to
provide
for
a
uniform
reasonable
apportionment
of
the
fund.
so
i
think
we're
trying
to
eliminate
the
35
lawsuits
as
well,
it
amounts
to
minimum
35
lawsuits
and
to
do
this
we
feel
that
the,
of
course
that
the
district
court
has
power
to
do
this
and
should
have
this
power.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
that's
not
our
intent
at
all
your
honor.
it's
not
our
intent
at
all.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
well,
i
think
we,
state
farm
happens
to
the
apparently
struck
the
wrong
individual
greyhound.
if
greyhound
were
not
a
solvent
corporation
and
the
possibility
of
recovery
against
them
would
not
be
as
great
as
the
plaintiffs
apparently
think
it
is
and
i
know
nothing
about
greyhound
situation,
i'm
sure
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
the
remedy
should
be
determined
by
who
the
parties
are
involved,
these
are
the
--
remedy
is
good
or
as
not
good
as
far
as
the
situation
is
concerned.
mr.
otto
r.
skopil,
jr.
thank
you.
