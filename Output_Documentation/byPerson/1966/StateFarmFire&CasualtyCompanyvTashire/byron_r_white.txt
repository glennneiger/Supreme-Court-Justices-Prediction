if
his
liability,
if
your
insured
liability
as
established
then
you
admit
your
liability
or
you
don't
admit
coverage
either,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
deny
every,
you
deny
not
only
his
liability
but
coverage?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
means
that
anytime
there
are
more
than
one
claimant
then
an
insurance
company
could
say
that
we'll
pick
the
court
and
every
--
all
the
claimants
must
come
in
and
claim
against
this
fund
here
not
anywhere
else,
that's
the
really
the
result,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
this
is
to
obtain,
even
though
you
deny
liability
and
even
though
the
claimant
has
to
establish
liability
of
the
insured,
he
still
has
to
establish
it
in
this
court
in

justice

even
though,
even
there
--
even
though
there
was
no
possibility
of
multiple
liability,
only
multiple
litigation?
justice
byron

so
the
answer
is
yes
even
though
it's
just
multiple
litigation?

justice

as
i
understand
your
opponents,
their
position
is
that
interpleadership
lie
not

where
the
claims
may
exceed
the
policy
limits,
but
even
though
they
didn’t,
if
there
are
multiple
claimants
and
interpleadership
lies
solely
to
solve
the
problem
of
multiple
litigation
rather
than
multiple
liability,
that
you--

[voice
