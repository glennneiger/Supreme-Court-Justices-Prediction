chief
justice.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
estate
tax
case
involving
the
marital
deduction
and
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
thus
a
bequest
of
property
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
surviving
widow
who
is
to
receive
a
fixed
dollar
monthly
payment
out
of
income
in
corpus,
and
he
was
given
a
general
power
of
appointment
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
where
an
actuarial
table
is
utilized
to
determine
the
value
of
the
specific
portion
of
the
cost
property
within
the
meaning
of
section
2056
(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
“the
will
of
the
decedent
bequeath
and
devise
one
half
of
the
residue
in
trust.”
the
trustee
was
directed
to
pay
the
widow
out
of
income
and
corpus
the
sum
of
$300
a
month
until
the
youngest
child
reached
18
and
$350
a
month
thereafter
for
life.
the
widow
was
given
a
general
power
of
appointment
to
appoint
the
--
by
will
the
principle
remaining
at
the
time
of
her
death.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
district
court
decided
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
corpus
was
unable
up,
to
the
time
of
the
hearing,
to
produce
income
of
$300
a
month,
the
marital
deduction
would
not
be
available
since
income
from
the
trust
could
have
exceeded
$300
a
month
and
the
surplus
would
then
be
required
to
be
accumulated.
since
the
surviving
spouse
was
not
specifically
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
of
the
trust
corpus,
the
district
court
reasoned
that
the
marital
deduction
should
not
be
allowed
on
that
point.
but
then
the
district
court
moved
on
to
say
since
they
were
assuming
that
the
trust
could
generate
more
than
$300
income
that
they
would
apply
an
actuarial
table
to
determine
what
the
present
value
of
the
$300
a
month
would
be
and
thus
could
carve
out
of
the
trust
corpus
that
part
which
it
would
label
a
specific
portion.
and
as
to
that,
the
district
court
did
allow
the
marital
deduction.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
five
to
three,
reversed
the
district
court.
the
third
circuit
majority
ruled
that
the
value
of
the
specific
portion
from
which
the
widow
would
be
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
for
life
was
not
acceptably
computed.
nextly,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
number
of
reasons
given,
misinterprets
the
will
as
we
have
emphasized
in
our
brief.
the
statute
is
silent
on
the
definition
of
specific
portion.
the
commissioner
of
the
treasury
has
adopted
regulations
wherein
it
indicates
that
the
specific
portion
should
be
stated
in
a
fractional
or
percentile.
the
courts
have
cast
doubt
on
the
regulations
or
have
considered
these
regulations
invalid.
the
third
circuit
majority
itself
cast
out
upon
the
regulation
because
it
doesn't
adopt
it.
it
finds
that
it
does
unnecessary
to
determine
the
validity
or
invalidity.
the
second
circuit
in
gelb,
in
298
f.2d
clearly
takes
the
position
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
when
insisting
that
the
specific
portion
be
a
fractional
or
percentile
of
the
trust.
in
that
case,
we
had
the
widow
entitled
to
the
income.
but,
there
was
a
child
who
was
entitled
under
the
trust,
if
the
trustee
so
determined,
to
--
up
to
$5,000
a
year
for
education
or
maintenance.
the
second
circuit
took
the
position
that
the
value
of
that
$5,000
determined
by
actuarial
tables
could
be
carved
out
of
the
trust
corpus
and
the
balance
therefore
could
be
eligible
for
the
marital
deduction.
the
seventh
circuit
in
citizens
national
bank
of
evansville,
221,
in
--
which
is
now
no.
1
--
488
in
this
court
on
a
pending
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
likewise
ruled
that
the
regulations
were
invalid
in
a
case
very
similar
to
the
one
at
bar.
when
congress
put
the
marital
deduction
section
on
the
books,
it
is
stated
in
the
hearings
and
even
in
this
stapf
that
equalization
between
common-law
citizens
and
community
property
citizens
was
designed.
i
would
prefer
to
suggest
that
what
congress
was
aiming
for
was
to
cut
down
the
discriminatory
gap
between
decedent's
estates
of
community
property
states
and
citizens
of
the
common-law
states
because
we
cannot
really
have
two
equalization.
only
in
the
classic
case
where
the
husband
owns
the
family
assets
and
dies
first
and
following
the
rules
of
the
road
can
we
have
this
equalization.
in
various
other
situations,
one
paul
anderson
writing
in
54
michigan
law
review
at
1087
points
out
a
number
of
postulates
where
there
will
be
substantial
inequality
between
the
two
property
systems.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
a
community
property
state,
the
spouses
own
one
half
of
the
community
property.
however,
we
submit
that
congress
permits
in
a
common-law
state
a
marital
deduction
if
the
wife
is
given
a
life
estate
and
a
power
of
appointment
to
her
estate
or
to
others.
we
realize
that
if
a
widow
only
has
a
life
estate
with
a
remainder
over
to
others
that
such
would
not
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
we
maintained
that
a
widow,
who
is
entitled
to
receive
$300
a
month
out
of
income
in
corpus
and
later
$350
a
month
for
her
life
and
has
the
power
to
appoint
to
her
state
or
to
others,
has
the
key
incidence
of
ownership
within
the
framework
of
this
type
of
a
statute.
we
don't
have
to
prove
that
she
has
the
equivalent
to
the
fee
simple
because
congress
recognizes
that
she
would
have
a
fee
simple
where
she
has
a
life
estate
with
a
power
to
appoint.
we
maintain
that
nowhere
that
congress
adopt
a
policy
of
value
fluctuations
on
which
the
government
lays
the
foundation
of
its
regulations.
the
second
circuit
in
gelb
finds
no
basis
for
such.but
even
if
that
were
in
congress'
mind
at
that
time,
we
say
in
the
case
at
bar,
if
the
value
of
the
corpus
increases;
it
will
be
includible
in
the
gross
estate
of
this
widow
when
she
passes
away.
now,
actuarial
tables
have
been
used
on
many
occasions
in
determining
valuation.
the
government
stresses
that
in
this
particular
case
have
we
used
a
capitalization
approach
we
would
have
had
a
value
in
excess
of
the
trust
corpus.
and
we
take
the
position
that
so
long
as
the
carving
out
process
takes
the
lesser,
whether
it
be
the
capitalization
method
or
the
annuity
method
that
that
is
the
amount
which
should
be
allowed
for
the
marital
deduction
and
not
the
hypothetical
excess
case.
but
we
also
feel
that
maybe
it
proves
too
much
from
the
government's
point
of
view
and
that
is
if
it
will
take
more
money
to
give
this
widow
$300
a
month
out
of
income
in
corpus,
then
it
should
follow
that
she
is
getting
all
of
the
income
from
the
corpus.
in
other
words,
if
this
widow
is
going
to
be
getting
$300
a
month
out
of
which
they
have
to
dipping
into
the
corpus,
then
it
follows
that
she
is
getting
all
of
the
income
of
that
particular
corpus.
if
we
move
on
and
say
that
the
$300
will
be
at
least
the
amount
of
income,
then
we
know
she's
getting
all
of
the
income
from
the
trust
corpus
because
the
balance
there
or
the
excess
is
being
accumulated
and
will
be
taxable
in
her
estate.
consequently,
we
take
the
position
that
if
the
$300
is
computed,
the
present
value
is
computed
on
an
actuarial
basis
that
the
correct
amount
will
be
carved
out
of
the
trust
corpus.
the
third
circuit
erred,
we
respectfully
submit,
in
reading
the
will
of
this
decedent
in
such
a
manner
as
to
destroy
the
marital
deduction,
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
government's
brief,
does
not
even
attempt
to
support
the
reasoning
of
the
third
circuit
majority
opinion.
for
example,
the
third
circuit
majority
opinion
took
the
position
that
there
would
be
a
fund
dissolution
if
we
used
the
annuity
basis
of
actuarial
tables
of
carving
out
and
then
says
that
the
testator
could
not
be
contemplated.
we
stressed
in
our
brief
that
the
testator
said,
“out
of
income
and
corpus,”
and
then
went
on
to
say,
“the
principle
remaining
at
the
time
of
death,”
which
indicates
to
us
that
the
testator
could
have
contemplated
dipping
into
the
corpus,
number
one,
but
also
a
dissipation.
nextly,
the
third
circuit
opinion
stresses
the
spendthrift
trust
clauses
in
the
will
and
even
the
regulations
of
the
commissioner
of
the
treasury
clearly
provide
that
such
spendthrift
trust
clauses
will
not
inhibit
the
marital
deduction.
and
nextly,
there
was
stress
made
upon
the
time
of
the
death
as
being
the
wrong
time
to
determine
the
valuation.
and
we
know
that
that
is
the
only
time
that
we
have
to
determine
the
valuation
for
marital
deduction
purposes
in
order
to
carve
out
the
thing.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
a
40-year
5%
bonds,
i
believe,
the
government
would
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
with
the
direction
to
hold
the
bonds
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
the
trustees
had
no
power
to
sell
the
bonds.
and
the
widow
was
entitled
to
all
the
income.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
only
the
three
--
in
other
words
--
all
right.
how
much
it
--
was
the
money,
mr.
justice
white
--
i
mean,
yes.
what
was
in
his
money?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
then
we
would
take
the
position
that
you
could
only
carve
out
that
amount
which
would
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
what's
that,
sir?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
we
would
say
--
would
be
sustainable
as
long
as
she
had
that
power
to
appoint
upon
her
death.
if
she
has
the
power
to
appoint
upon
her
death,
the
principle
in
that
trust
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
--
that
the
marital
deduction
flows.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
see,
if
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
is
she
the
sole
beneficiary
of
this
cost
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
--
during
her
life?
she
has
the
sole
power
to
appoint
by
her
--
upon
her
death?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
then
we
would
take
the
position
that
we
would
--
we
would
take
an
actuarial
table
and
determine
the
value
of
what
she
is
going
to
receive
income-wise
and
carve
that
out.
and
the
reason
i
take
that
position
is
because
you
have
now
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
i
would
prevent
the
marital
deduction
as
to
that
part
which
could
be
carved
out
as
determined
by
an
actuarial
table
for
the
reason
that
you
have
now
indicated
that
she
does
not
have
all
of
the
income
of
the
specific
portion,
but
she
does
have
the
authority
to
give
away
all
of
the
trust
corpus
by
her
will
to
her
estate
or
to
others.
consequently,
we
satisfy
the
latter
part,
but
we
don't
satisfy
the
magic
words
“all
of
the
income.”
and
because
we
know
that
she
is
going
to
get
half
of
the
income,
then
i
believe
that
even
the
government
would
admit
that
we
would
be
allowed
a
marital
deduction
as
to
that
one
half.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
oh,
yes.
even
the
government's
example
in
its
brief
produces
value.
his
--
to
me,
it's
an
easier
case.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
our
case
--
our
case
is
$300
a
month
out
of
income
in
corpus
is
what
we're
stressing.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
and
basically,
are
we
going
to
say
that
congress
would
have
bought
at
the
use
of
an
actuarial
table
in
carving
it
out?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
you
put
your
finger
on
exactly,
mr.
--
i
would
like
to
make
one
more
point
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may,
for
rebuttal.
the
rules
were
proposed,
the
regulations
were
proposed
in
october
of
1956.
the
will
was
written
in
january
of
'57,
january
‘57.
the
death
occurred
may
3,
‘58.
the
rules
were
promulgated
june
23,
‘58.
therefore,
those
who
were
watching
proposed
rules
would
have
known.
those
who
were
waiting
for
final
rules
would
have
not
known
under
the
context
of
this
case.
therefore,
we
respectfully
submit
that
we
should
not
be
expected
to
have
these
regulations
take
the
form
outlaw
reported
being
on
the
books
quite
a
bit
of
time.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
in
answering
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
fortas,
with
respect
to
a
$20,000
type
of
corpus,
i
respectfully
submit
that
counsel
for
the
government
forgot
one
important
sentence
in
the
regulations
which
he
is
endeavoring
to
sustain
in
this
court.
may
i
read,
in
the
regulations,
“on
the
other
hand,
if
the
annual
income
of
the
spouse
is
limited
to
a
specific
sum
or
if
she
has
a
power
to
appoint
only
a
specific
sum
other
than
larger
fund
the
interest
is
not
a
deductible
interest.”
the
regulations
say
that
very
clearly.
therefore,
it
is
our
argument
along
with
the
second
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
that
the
regulations
requiring
a
percentile
or
a
fraction
of
are
invalid
because
the
regulations
clearly
say
once
you
have
a
specific
sum,
once
you
have
a
fixed
dollar
limit,
you
cannot
have
the
marital
deduction.
we
say
those
regulations
are
invalid.
we
feel
just
like
the
second
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
well,
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
we
think
so,
your
honor.
we
also
think
this
that
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment,
i
don't
take
a
$20,000
but
i
take
a
million
dollar
estate
wherein
the
testator
says,
“pay
my
wife
$500,000
the
first
year
after
i'm
gone
--
within
the
first
year
after
i'm
gone
and
five
--
and
the
balance,”
because
there
would
be
some
accumulated
income,
“and
the
balance
within
two
years
after
i
am
deceased.”
i
submit
that
the
regulations
as
drafted
would
prohibit
the
marital
deduction.
nextly,
i
should
like
to
stress
one
point,
the
district
court
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
that
we
concede.
and
that
is
why
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention
that
in
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
said,
“notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
corpus
has
been
unable
up
to
this
time
to
produce
income
of
$300
per
month,”
it
would
appear
that
plaintiff
is
not
entitled
to
take
as
a
marital
deduction
the
value
of
the
property
passing
to
the
decedents
surviving
spouse
under
the
testamentary
residuary
trust.
under
the
terms
of
the
decendents
will
income
from
the
trust
could
have
exceeded
$300
per
month
and
the
surplus
would
then
be
required
to
be
accumulated.
and
that
is
why
the
district
judge
said
no
marital
deduction
as
to
the
entire
trust
corpus.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
good
question.
while
shaving
this
morning,
my
answer
was
“no,”
but
my
feelings
were
that
we
were
sort
of
bound
by
the
approach
taken
by
the
majority
of
the
third
circuit
and
in
our
brief,
we
were
knocking
it
down,
so
to
speak.
we
were
attacking
the
majority
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
--
of
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
good
question.
perhaps
we
ought
to
then
be
able
to
go
back
to
show
that
at
the
present
time,
the
trust
isn't
generating
it.
but
we
have
to
live
with
a
record
that
was
built
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
we
did.
we
tried.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
what
am
i
arguing
for
here?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
that
the
--
i
am
arguing
here,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
the
majority
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
in
support
of
its
decision
was
in
error.
and
i
am
therefore
maintaining
that
this
widow
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
because
i
feel
if
we
get
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
then
i
think
we
would
be
entitled
to
the
refund.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
well,
you
see,
it
makes
no
difference
to
us,
if
your
honor
pleases,
whether
we
get
the
entire
trust
corpus
permitted
or
just
the
specific
portion
because
the
marital
deduction
that
we
are
entitled
to
as
a
maximum
is
99
plus
thousands
of
dollars.
and
even
if
we
have
the
entire
trust
corpus
included,
and
we
were
entitled
to
the
entire
plus
corpus,
dollar-wise,
it
would
mean
anything
extra
to
us.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
we
still
got
the
entire
refund
allowed
by
the
district
court
because
even
using
the
actuarial
table
in
determining
the
specific
portion,
we
were
then
still
within
shooting
range
of
the
maximum
marital
deduction
which
means
that
we
did
get
the
maximum
marital
deduction
allowed.
one
point,
i
should
have
made
clear
perhaps
to
my
answer
to
you,
mr.
justice
white,
there
were
other
assets
which
the
widow
received
which
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
you
--
you
put
your
finger
on
it
exactly,
mr.
justice
white.
thank
you,
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
estate
tax
case
involving
the
marital
deduction
and
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
thus
a
bequest
of
property
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
surviving
widow
who
is
to
receive
a
fixed
dollar
monthly
payment
out
of
income
in
corpus,
and
he
was
given
a
general
power
of
appointment
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
where
an
actuarial
table
is
utilized
to
determine
the
value
of
the
specific
portion
of
the
cost
property
within
the
meaning
of
section
2056
(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
“the
will
of
the
decedent
bequeath
and
devise
one
half
of
the
residue
in
trust.”
the
trustee
was
directed
to
pay
the
widow
out
of
income
and
corpus
the
sum
of
$300
a
month
until
the
youngest
child
reached
18
and
$350
a
month
thereafter
for
life.
the
widow
was
given
a
general
power
of
appointment
to
appoint
the
--
by
will
the
principle
remaining
at
the
time
of
her
death.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
district
court
decided
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
corpus
was
unable
up,
to
the
time
of
the
hearing,
to
produce
income
of
$300
a
month,
the
marital
deduction
would
not
be
available
since
income
from
the
trust
could
have
exceeded
$300
a
month
and
the
surplus
would
then
be
required
to
be
accumulated.
since
the
surviving
spouse
was
not
specifically
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
of
the
trust
corpus,
the
district
court
reasoned
that
the
marital
deduction
should
not
be
allowed
on
that
point.
but
then
the
district
court
moved
on
to
say
since
they
were
assuming
that
the
trust
could
generate
more
than
$300
income
that
they
would
apply
an
actuarial
table
to
determine
what
the
present
value
of
the
$300
a
month
would
be
and
thus
could
carve
out
of
the
trust
corpus
that
part
which
it
would
label
a
specific
portion.
and
as
to
that,
the
district
court
did
allow
the
marital
deduction.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
five
to
three,
reversed
the
district
court.
the
third
circuit
majority
ruled
that
the
value
of
the
specific
portion
from
which
the
widow
would
be
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
for
life
was
not
acceptably
computed.
nextly,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
number
of
reasons
given,
misinterprets
the
will
as
we
have
emphasized
in
our
brief.
the
statute
is
silent
on
the
definition
of
specific
portion.
the
commissioner
of
the
treasury
has
adopted
regulations
wherein
it
indicates
that
the
specific
portion
should
be
stated
in
a
fractional
or
percentile.
the
courts
have
cast
doubt
on
the
regulations
or
have
considered
these
regulations
invalid.
the
third
circuit
majority
itself
cast
out
upon
the
regulation
because
it
doesn't
adopt
it.
it
finds
that
it
does
unnecessary
to
determine
the
validity
or
invalidity.
the
second
circuit
in
gelb,
in
298
f.2d
clearly
takes
the
position
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
when
insisting
that
the
specific
portion
be
a
fractional
or
percentile
of
the
trust.
in
that
case,
we
had
the
widow
entitled
to
the
income.
but,
there
was
a
child
who
was
entitled
under
the
trust,
if
the
trustee
so
determined,
to
--
up
to
$5,000
a
year
for
education
or
maintenance.
the
second
circuit
took
the
position
that
the
value
of
that
$5,000
determined
by
actuarial
tables
could
be
carved
out
of
the
trust
corpus
and
the
balance
therefore
could
be
eligible
for
the
marital
deduction.
the
seventh
circuit
in
citizens
national
bank
of
evansville,
221,
in
--
which
is
now
no.
1
--
488
in
this
court
on
a
pending
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
likewise
ruled
that
the
regulations
were
invalid
in
a
case
very
similar
to
the
one
at
bar.
when
congress
put
the
marital
deduction
section
on
the
books,
it
is
stated
in
the
hearings
and
even
in
this
stapf
that
equalization
between
common-law
citizens
and
community
property
citizens
was
designed.
i
would
prefer
to
suggest
that
what
congress
was
aiming
for
was
to
cut
down
the
discriminatory
gap
between
decedent's
estates
of
community
property
states
and
citizens
of
the
common-law
states
because
we
cannot
really
have
two
equalization.
only
in
the
classic
case
where
the
husband
owns
the
family
assets
and
dies
first
and
following
the
rules
of
the
road
can
we
have
this
equalization.
in
various
other
situations,
one
paul
anderson
writing
in
54
michigan
law
review
at
1087
points
out
a
number
of
postulates
where
there
will
be
substantial
inequality
between
the
two
property
systems.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
a
community
property
state,
the
spouses
own
one
half
of
the
community
property.
however,
we
submit
that
congress
permits
in
a
common-law
state
a
marital
deduction
if
the
wife
is
given
a
life
estate
and
a
power
of
appointment
to
her
estate
or
to
others.
we
realize
that
if
a
widow
only
has
a
life
estate
with
a
remainder
over
to
others
that
such
would
not
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
we
maintained
that
a
widow,
who
is
entitled
to
receive
$300
a
month
out
of
income
in
corpus
and
later
$350
a
month
for
her
life
and
has
the
power
to
appoint
to
her
state
or
to
others,
has
the
key
incidence
of
ownership
within
the
framework
of
this
type
of
a
statute.
we
don't
have
to
prove
that
she
has
the
equivalent
to
the
fee
simple
because
congress
recognizes
that
she
would
have
a
fee
simple
where
she
has
a
life
estate
with
a
power
to
appoint.
we
maintain
that
nowhere
that
congress
adopt
a
policy
of
value
fluctuations
on
which
the
government
lays
the
foundation
of
its
regulations.
the
second
circuit
in
gelb
finds
no
basis
for
such.but
even
if
that
were
in
congress'
mind
at
that
time,
we
say
in
the
case
at
bar,
if
the
value
of
the
corpus
increases;
it
will
be
includible
in
the
gross
estate
of
this
widow
when
she
passes
away.
now,
actuarial
tables
have
been
used
on
many
occasions
in
determining
valuation.
the
government
stresses
that
in
this
particular
case
have
we
used
a
capitalization
approach
we
would
have
had
a
value
in
excess
of
the
trust
corpus.
and
we
take
the
position
that
so
long
as
the
carving
out
process
takes
the
lesser,
whether
it
be
the
capitalization
method
or
the
annuity
method
that
that
is
the
amount
which
should
be
allowed
for
the
marital
deduction
and
not
the
hypothetical
excess
case.
but
we
also
feel
that
maybe
it
proves
too
much
from
the
government's
point
of
view
and
that
is
if
it
will
take
more
money
to
give
this
widow
$300
a
month
out
of
income
in
corpus,
then
it
should
follow
that
she
is
getting
all
of
the
income
from
the
corpus.
in
other
words,
if
this
widow
is
going
to
be
getting
$300
a
month
out
of
which
they
have
to
dipping
into
the
corpus,
then
it
follows
that
she
is
getting
all
of
the
income
of
that
particular
corpus.
if
we
move
on
and
say
that
the
$300
will
be
at
least
the
amount
of
income,
then
we
know
she's
getting
all
of
the
income
from
the
trust
corpus
because
the
balance
there
or
the
excess
is
being
accumulated
and
will
be
taxable
in
her
estate.
consequently,
we
take
the
position
that
if
the
$300
is
computed,
the
present
value
is
computed
on
an
actuarial
basis
that
the
correct
amount
will
be
carved
out
of
the
trust
corpus.
the
third
circuit
erred,
we
respectfully
submit,
in
reading
the
will
of
this
decedent
in
such
a
manner
as
to
destroy
the
marital
deduction,
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
government's
brief,
does
not
even
attempt
to
support
the
reasoning
of
the
third
circuit
majority
opinion.
for
example,
the
third
circuit
majority
opinion
took
the
position
that
there
would
be
a
fund
dissolution
if
we
used
the
annuity
basis
of
actuarial
tables
of
carving
out
and
then
says
that
the
testator
could
not
be
contemplated.
we
stressed
in
our
brief
that
the
testator
said,
“out
of
income
and
corpus,”
and
then
went
on
to
say,
“the
principle
remaining
at
the
time
of
death,”
which
indicates
to
us
that
the
testator
could
have
contemplated
dipping
into
the
corpus,
number
one,
but
also
a
dissipation.
nextly,
the
third
circuit
opinion
stresses
the
spendthrift
trust
clauses
in
the
will
and
even
the
regulations
of
the
commissioner
of
the
treasury
clearly
provide
that
such
spendthrift
trust
clauses
will
not
inhibit
the
marital
deduction.
and
nextly,
there
was
stress
made
upon
the
time
of
the
death
as
being
the
wrong
time
to
determine
the
valuation.
and
we
know
that
that
is
the
only
time
that
we
have
to
determine
the
valuation
for
marital
deduction
purposes
in
order
to
carve
out
the
thing.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
a
40-year
5%
bonds,
i
believe,
the
government
would
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
with
the
direction
to
hold
the
bonds
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
the
trustees
had
no
power
to
sell
the
bonds.
and
the
widow
was
entitled
to
all
the
income.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
only
the
three
--
in
other
words
--
all
right.
how
much
it
--
was
the
money,
mr.
justice
white
--
i
mean,
yes.
what
was
in
his
money?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
then
we
would
take
the
position
that
you
could
only
carve
out
that
amount
which
would
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
what's
that,
sir?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
we
would
say
--
would
be
sustainable
as
long
as
she
had
that
power
to
appoint
upon
her
death.
if
she
has
the
power
to
appoint
upon
her
death,
the
principle
in
that
trust
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
--
that
the
marital
deduction
flows.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
see,
if
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
is
she
the
sole
beneficiary
of
this
cost
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
--
during
her
life?
she
has
the
sole
power
to
appoint
by
her
--
upon
her
death?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
then
we
would
take
the
position
that
we
would
--
we
would
take
an
actuarial
table
and
determine
the
value
of
what
she
is
going
to
receive
income-wise
and
carve
that
out.
and
the
reason
i
take
that
position
is
because
you
have
now
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
i
would
prevent
the
marital
deduction
as
to
that
part
which
could
be
carved
out
as
determined
by
an
actuarial
table
for
the
reason
that
you
have
now
indicated
that
she
does
not
have
all
of
the
income
of
the
specific
portion,
but
she
does
have
the
authority
to
give
away
all
of
the
trust
corpus
by
her
will
to
her
estate
or
to
others.
consequently,
we
satisfy
the
latter
part,
but
we
don't
satisfy
the
magic
words
“all
of
the
income.”
and
because
we
know
that
she
is
going
to
get
half
of
the
income,
then
i
believe
that
even
the
government
would
admit
that
we
would
be
allowed
a
marital
deduction
as
to
that
one
half.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
oh,
yes.
even
the
government's
example
in
its
brief
produces
value.
his
--
to
me,
it's
an
easier
case.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
our
case
--
our
case
is
$300
a
month
out
of
income
in
corpus
is
what
we're
stressing.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
and
basically,
are
we
going
to
say
that
congress
would
have
bought
at
the
use
of
an
actuarial
table
in
carving
it
out?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
you
put
your
finger
on
exactly,
mr.
--
i
would
like
to
make
one
more
point
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may,
for
rebuttal.
the
rules
were
proposed,
the
regulations
were
proposed
in
october
of
1956.
the
will
was
written
in
january
of
'57,
january
‘57.
the
death
occurred
may
3,
‘58.
the
rules
were
promulgated
june
23,
‘58.
therefore,
those
who
were
watching
proposed
rules
would
have
known.
those
who
were
waiting
for
final
rules
would
have
not
known
under
the
context
of
this
case.
therefore,
we
respectfully
submit
that
we
should
not
be
expected
to
have
these
regulations
take
the
form
outlaw
reported
being
on
the
books
quite
a
bit
of
time.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
in
answering
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
fortas,
with
respect
to
a
$20,000
type
of
corpus,
i
respectfully
submit
that
counsel
for
the
government
forgot
one
important
sentence
in
the
regulations
which
he
is
endeavoring
to
sustain
in
this
court.
may
i
read,
in
the
regulations,
“on
the
other
hand,
if
the
annual
income
of
the
spouse
is
limited
to
a
specific
sum
or
if
she
has
a
power
to
appoint
only
a
specific
sum
other
than
larger
fund
the
interest
is
not
a
deductible
interest.”
the
regulations
say
that
very
clearly.
therefore,
it
is
our
argument
along
with
the
second
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
that
the
regulations
requiring
a
percentile
or
a
fraction
of
are
invalid
because
the
regulations
clearly
say
once
you
have
a
specific
sum,
once
you
have
a
fixed
dollar
limit,
you
cannot
have
the
marital
deduction.
we
say
those
regulations
are
invalid.
we
feel
just
like
the
second
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
well,
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
we
think
so,
your
honor.
we
also
think
this
that
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment,
i
don't
take
a
$20,000
but
i
take
a
million
dollar
estate
wherein
the
testator
says,
“pay
my
wife
$500,000
the
first
year
after
i'm
gone
--
within
the
first
year
after
i'm
gone
and
five
--
and
the
balance,”
because
there
would
be
some
accumulated
income,
“and
the
balance
within
two
years
after
i
am
deceased.”
i
submit
that
the
regulations
as
drafted
would
prohibit
the
marital
deduction.
nextly,
i
should
like
to
stress
one
point,
the
district
court
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
that
we
concede.
and
that
is
why
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention
that
in
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
said,
“notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
corpus
has
been
unable
up
to
this
time
to
produce
income
of
$300
per
month,”
it
would
appear
that
plaintiff
is
not
entitled
to
take
as
a
marital
deduction
the
value
of
the
property
passing
to
the
decedents
surviving
spouse
under
the
testamentary
residuary
trust.
under
the
terms
of
the
decendents
will
income
from
the
trust
could
have
exceeded
$300
per
month
and
the
surplus
would
then
be
required
to
be
accumulated.
and
that
is
why
the
district
judge
said
no
marital
deduction
as
to
the
entire
trust
corpus.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
good
question.
while
shaving
this
morning,
my
answer
was
“no,”
but
my
feelings
were
that
we
were
sort
of
bound
by
the
approach
taken
by
the
majority
of
the
third
circuit
and
in
our
brief,
we
were
knocking
it
down,
so
to
speak.
we
were
attacking
the
majority
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
--
of
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
good
question.
perhaps
we
ought
to
then
be
able
to
go
back
to
show
that
at
the
present
time,
the
trust
isn't
generating
it.
but
we
have
to
live
with
a
record
that
was
built
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
we
did.
we
tried.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
what
am
i
arguing
for
here?
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
that
the
--
i
am
arguing
here,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
the
majority
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
in
support
of
its
decision
was
in
error.
and
i
am
therefore
maintaining
that
this
widow
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
because
i
feel
if
we
get
--
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
then
i
think
we
would
be
entitled
to
the
refund.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
well,
you
see,
it
makes
no
difference
to
us,
if
your
honor
pleases,
whether
we
get
the
entire
trust
corpus
permitted
or
just
the
specific
portion
because
the
marital
deduction
that
we
are
entitled
to
as
a
maximum
is
99
plus
thousands
of
dollars.
and
even
if
we
have
the
entire
trust
corpus
included,
and
we
were
entitled
to
the
entire
plus
corpus,
dollar-wise,
it
would
mean
anything
extra
to
us.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
we
still
got
the
entire
refund
allowed
by
the
district
court
because
even
using
the
actuarial
table
in
determining
the
specific
portion,
we
were
then
still
within
shooting
range
of
the
maximum
marital
deduction
which
means
that
we
did
get
the
maximum
marital
deduction
allowed.
one
point,
i
should
have
made
clear
perhaps
to
my
answer
to
you,
mr.
justice
white,
there
were
other
assets
which
the
widow
received
which
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
milton
i.
baldinger
you
--
you
put
your
finger
on
it
exactly,
mr.
justice
white.
thank
you,
sir.
thank
you.
