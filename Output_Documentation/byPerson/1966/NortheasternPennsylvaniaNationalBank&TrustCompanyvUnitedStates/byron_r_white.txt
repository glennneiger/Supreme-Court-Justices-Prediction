justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
estate
here
consisted
of
a
40-year
5%
bond
and
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
direction
to
hold
the
bond?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
power
to
sell
the
bonds?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
just
the
$300
a
month.
justice
byron
r.
white
twice
as
--
twice
as
much
as
what
is
necessary
to
pay
--
to
--
to
pay
$300.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
would
permit
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
the
marital
deduction
would
be
--
would
be
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
then
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
--
no
necessity
in
the
--
in
the
trust
instrument
to
assign
any
specific
portion
of
the
corpus
to
it.
just
have
me
like
to
say
the
income
from
half
of
the
corpus.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
--
all
that
--
in
that
situation,
all
that
would
be
needed
is,
to
say,
$300
a
month.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
beneficiary.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
--
let's
just
assume
that
--
that
the
will
says,
“the
remainder
of
the
income,”
if
any,
which
there
would
be
in
my
example,
“is
paid
to
some
other
people,”
but
she
has
the
power
to
appoint
the
entire
corpus?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
how
about
the
marital
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
turned
out
that
the
corpus
--
total
corpuses
trust
was
$5,000
in
order
to
pay
$300
a
month,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
my
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
my
example,
your
opponent
on
the
bonds?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
just
--
you're
just
saying
here
that
on
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case,
there's
just
as
many
limitations
that
is
the
equivalent
of
the
--
of
the
picture.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
that
amount
to
here?
what
would
the
--
(inaudible)
years
of
the
annuity
tell
or
not
tell?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
had
$20,000
trust
year
and
on
that
reasoning,
does
that
mean
that
that
would
qualify?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
involves
--
that
involves
a
judgment
as
to
life
expectancy
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
in
the
--
if
the
trust
estate
here,
if
the
corpus
was
$20,000
and
you
say
that
many
marital
deduction
would
be
available,
in
that
situation,
you
are
also
making
some
assumptions
as
to
the
widow's
life
expectancy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
value
things
at
the
time
of
death?is
that
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
say
that
--
i
know
you
say
that
but
that's
the
way
tax
valued
(inaudible)
at
the
time
of
death
or
one
year
after?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
widow
--
but
the
widow
had
taken
against
the
will
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
would
have
been
the
situation
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
she
would
have
half
of
--
half
of
the
--
of
the
interest
that's
passed
from
the
decedent
to
her.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
just
want
to
--
i'm
not
making
the
argument,
i
just
wanted
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
that
have
been
here
if
you
--
you
got
in
half?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
lobby
in
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
--
and
what
was
the
claim
here
of
the
petitioner
for
--
for
the
marital
deduction?
how
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
$63,000.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
do
--
we
do
agree
that
the
three
and
a
half
percent
of
the
laws
that
was
--
if
it
reasonably
expect
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
--
how
about
in
an
annuity
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
annuity
approach
assume
an
amount
of
principle
that
would
also
be
exhausted
by
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
sort
of
just
the
gist
of
your
argument
on
three
and
a
half
percent
capital.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
would
cover
--
that
regulation
would
cover
the
fixed
--
the
bond
corpus
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
the
income
that
was
--
exceeds
the
--
the
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
would
be
a
very
convenient
device
to
use
however
in
a
period
of
rising
values.
if
you
could
get
a
valuation
at
the
day
of
the
death
and
give
a
specific
summary
that
should
might
give
the
entire
corpus.
you
--
i
would
suppose
you
would
concede
that
--
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
--
that
the
widow
is
not
entitled
to
marital
deduction
with
respect
to
the
accumulated
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
abandoned
--
have
you
abandoned
your
position
you
took
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
if
you
managed
to
get
the
court
of
appeals
reverse?
what
do
we
do
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
but
you
--
you
build
the
record
in
the
district
court,
i
suppose,
based
on
the
idea
to
get
the
whole
corpus.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
which
--
what
are
you
--
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
arguing
--
you're
arguing
to
get
the
judgement
reversed?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
get
the
judgement
reversed,
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
if
the
court
--
the
district
court
cut
you
back
from
your
claim
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
about
$30,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
it's
forty
some
thousand
dollars
like
you
got
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
--
that
you
got
all
--
that
you
--
in
the
district
court,
you
won
all
you
wanted
to
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
on
another
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
makes
no
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
estate
here
consisted
of
a
40-year
5%
bond
and
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
direction
to
hold
the
bond?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
power
to
sell
the
bonds?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
just
the
$300
a
month.
justice
byron
r.
white
twice
as
--
twice
as
much
as
what
is
necessary
to
pay
--
to
--
to
pay
$300.
justice
byron

white
if
you
would
