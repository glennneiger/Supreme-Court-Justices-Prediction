clearly,
mr.
justice
white's
question
puts
an
easier
case
for
you
than
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
this
really
comes
down
to
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
phrase,
“a
specific
portion
thereof,”
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
order
to
produce
--
in
order
to
pay
her
$300
a
month,
fairly
$600
a
year,
there
does
have
to
be
an
invasion
of
corpus.
she
gets
all
the
income
plus,
doesn't
she,
as
--
as
a
factual
manner
of
--
of
the
real
world
and
how
much
you
can
have
that
money
for?
justice
potter
stewart
the
corpus
was
about
$70,000
or
little
les,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
produce
$3,600
a
year,
that's
at
five
plus
percent
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

that
finding
though
that
this
corpus
was
capable
of
producing
more
than
that.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

saying.
justice
potter
stewart
first
it
could
be
an
increase
in
the
capital
value.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
common
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
commonplace
in
tax
law
generally
to
use
this
kind
of
computation,
isn't
it,
as
figuring
out
the
value
of
remainders
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
the
corpus
in
this
case
has
been
20,000
--
$20,000,
would
you
have
the
same
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
will
applied
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
--
in
a
very
short
time
that
$20,000
would
be
greatly
reduced
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
through
the
year.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
--
i
think
you
mean
not
only
that
she
was
but
she
would
have
to
be
under
any
--
any
kind
of
condition.
justice
potter
stewart
would
necessarily?
justice
potter
stewart
would
necessarily?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
original
48
law
required
all
the

of
all
the
corpus,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

days
and
i
was
trying
to
practice
tax
laws
and
--
and
then
the
--
the
basic
reason
for
the
change
in
'54
was
to
obviate
a
necessity
of
setting
up

trust
if
you
want
to
provide
for
a
widow

children,
for

was

justice

stewart
does
the

show
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
that
--
you
maybe
right
that
assumes
the
answer
to
you.
i'm
not
to
assume
the
correctness
of
your

what
the
reason
for
the
computation
is
is
to
identify

the

will
get
