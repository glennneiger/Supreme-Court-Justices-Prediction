mr.
richard
c.
pugh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
turns
on
whether
decedents
bequest
to
his
widow
a
fixed
monthly
payments
from
a
variable
yield
of
trust
constituted
the
bequest
of
all
the
income
from
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
as
section
2056
(b)
(5)
requires
if
that
bequest
is
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
the
key
words,
we
here
submit,
are
all
of
the
income
from
the
specific
portion
must
be
given
to
the
widow
if
the
bequest
to
her
is
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
the
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
section
2056
(b)
(5)
make
it
clear
that
congress
has
required
that
the
widow
be
given
all
the
income
from
a
specific
portion
or
trust
property
in
order
to
insure
that
she
will
have
the
rights
of
a
virtual
owner
in
that
portion,
in
order
to
insure
that
her
income
will
rise
and
fall
with
the
actual
income
generated
by
the
trust
property,
just
as
owners
would.
the
widow
must
receive
the
rights
of
a
virtual
owner
because
it
follows
from
congress'
intent
to
achieve
estate
tax
equality
between
common-law
and
community
property
states
that
a
bequest
of
trust
income
to
a
widow
in
a
common-law
state
should
not
be
tax-exempt
unless
the
widow
receives
rights
equivalent
to
those
enjoyed
by
a
spouse
in
a
community
property
state
in
her
share
of
the
community
property.
now,
the
petitioner
here
argues
that
since
the
value
of
the
widow's
right
to
receive
fixed
payments
can
be
estimated
through
an
annuity
computation
based
on
various
arbitrary
assumptions,
that
estimated
value
that
can
be
considered
a
qualifying
specific
portion
under
the
statute.
we
submit
that
whether
a
bequest
in
trust
qualifies
under
section
2056(b)
(5)
turns
not
on
whether
the
widow's
interest
can
be
valued
but
on
whether
the
widow
has
been
given
the
right's
equivalent
to
virtual
ownership
that
are
specified
in
section
2056(b)
(5)
including
the
right
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
a
most
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property
during
her
lifetime.
furthermore
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
--
the
basic
objective,
your
honor,
of
the
--
of
the
marital
--
of
this
particular
section,
section
2056
(b)
(5)
was
to
give
the
--
the
estate
a
marital
deduction
for
a
portion
of
trust
property
if
the
widow
received
in
that
portion
of
trust
property
the
rights
of
virtual
ownership.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
it
was
necessarily
to
do
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
you're
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor,
i
guess
that's
--
basically,
from
the
congressional
purpose
to
equalize
the
estate
tax
effects
and
community
property
in
common-law
states,
congress
wanted
to
ensure
that
a
bequest
of
trust
income
to
a
widow
and
a
common-law
state
should
not
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
unless
the
widow
received
rights
that
were
equivalent
to
the
outright
ownership
enjoyed
in
--
in
--
by
a
spouse
in
a
community
property
state
in
her
share
of
the
community
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
she
had
a
power
of
appointment
over
the
entire
corpus.
and
the
problem
is
whether,
like
an
owner,
she
had
the
right
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
an
identifiable
portion
of
trust
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
no
--
your
honor,
with
respect
the
court
below
held
that
while
the
trust
had
not
generated
enough
income
to
produce
the
$300
per
month
payments,
the
--
the
corpus
was
capable
of
producing
that
much
income.
therefore
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
sir.
the
court
specially
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
five
and
a
half
percent
interest
on
the
initial
value
of
the
corpus
would
have
produced
enough
to
make
these
payments
to
the
widow.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
court
below
held
that
for
that
reason,
because
the
--
because
the
corpus
was
capable
of
producing
more
than
the
income
required
to
produce
the
$300
per
month
payments,
the
widow
was
not
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
corpus.
it's
quite
impossible
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor,
that
indicates
what
the
precise
yield
of
the
corpus
was.
and
i
take
it
the
court
reached
this
finding
on
the
basis
of
its
reduction
that
the
corpuses
$70,000
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
could
be
capable
of
producing
more
than
$3,600,
if
not
now,
then
at
some
point
in
the
future.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
the
statute
clearly
requires
that
the
widow
be
entitled
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
trust
corpus
throughout
her
lifetime.
and
in
the
period
of
rising
values,
it's
--
it's
entirely
possible
that
a
trust
corpus
of
this
magnitude
would
produce
more
than
enough
income
to
enable
payment
of
the
$300
per
month,
at
which
point
the
excess
income
would
be
accumulated.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
--
your
honor,
in
a
case
as
clear
as
that,
it
would
be
--
and
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
widow
would
be
entitled
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
corpus.
so
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
therefore
the
entire
value
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
regulations
in
requiring
that
a
specific
portion
be
cast
in
terms
of
a
fractional
share
or
its
equivalent
don't
require
that
the
magic
language
of
fractional
share
or
percentile
interest
be
used.
i
think
in
your
example
in
which
you
got
a
fixed
yield
trust,
in
which
the
widow
is
to
receive
the
former
fixed
payments
half
the
income
generated
by
the
trust,
we
would
clearly
have
a
bequest
to
the
widow
that
would
be
the
equivalent
to
a
fractional
share
that
they
wouldn't
have.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
we
--
we
submit
that
at
the
decedent's
death,
we
have
to
be
able
to
point
to
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property
from
which
the
widow
will
receive
all
of
the
income
that's
actually
generated
through
her
lifetime.
now,
the
petitioner
suggest
that
we
can
use
an
annuity
evaluation
to
isolate
a
specific
portion.
we
submit
that
since
the
annuity
computation
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
corpus
will
have
a
fixed
constant
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
whereas
in
fact,
the
yield
from
this
trust
corpus
is
going
to
vary.
now,
that
computation
cannot
serve
to
isolate
a
specific
portion
of
this
trust
corpus
from
which
the
widow
will
necessarily
receive
all
of
the
income
throughout
her
lifetime
as
an
owner
would
and
as
we
submit
the
statute
clearly
requires.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor,
and
certainly,
the
--
the
use
of
this
kind
of
computation
to
figure
out
the
value
of
a
--
an
interest
such
as
a
remainder
or
annuity
that
has
to
be
included
in
a
gross
estate
is
entirely
appropriate
and
--
and
extremely
helpful.
we
submit,
however,
that
this
kind
of
a
computation
based
on
an
assumed
fixed
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
is
entirely
inappropriate
when
the
question
is
whether
the
widow
was
given
the
rights
of
virtual
ownership
prescribed
in
section
2056
(b)
(5).
it's
inappropriate
because
the
annuity
assumes
a
fixed
constant
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
whereas
in
fact
no
one
knows
what
yield
of
this
trust
will
be
over
the
future.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
your
honor,
actually
two
techniques
of
valuation
of
the
widow's
rights
have
been
used
by
the
lower
courts.
the
court
in
this
case
used
an
annuity
computation
which
resulted
in
a
$63,000
specific
portion.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
approved
the
capitalization
approach.
under
the
annuity
approaches
by
the
court
below,
a
computation
is
made
of
the
amount
of
corpus
that
would
be
required
to
pay
an
annuity
of
$300
per
month
over
the
theoretical
life
expectancy
of
the
widow
using
both
the
corpus
and
the
income
at
an
assumed
fixed
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
on
the
assumption
of
the
corpus
would
be
exhausted
at
the
end
of
the
theoretical
life
expectancy
of
the
widow.
the
capitalization
approach
has
been
used
by
the
district
court
in
the
citizen's
national
bank,
which
is
pending
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
here
and
which
was
approved
by
the
seventh
circuit,
involves
simply
a
computation
of
the
amount
of
the
corpus
which
at
a
fixed
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
would
throw
off
$300
per
month
assuming
no
exhaustion
or
diminution
of
the
corpus.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
in
this
case,
that
would
--
that
would
result
with
--
the
capitalization
approach
would
result
in
a
valuation
of
$103,000
for
the
widow's
right
to
receive
fixed
payments.
of
course,
this
vastly
an
excess
of
the
full
value
of
the
trust
corpus,
$69,000.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
that
--
in
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
in
a
period
of
rising
values,
it's
difficult
to
predict
what
the
future
yield
of
a
particular
piece
of
property
will
be.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
your
honor,
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
clear
that
the
trust
corpus
would
not
generate
enough
income
to
produce
the
fixed
monthly
payments,
then
it
would
be
proper
to
conclude
that
the
widow
was
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
trust
corpus.
therefore,
the
entire
trust
corpus
would
qualify
for
marital
deduction.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
clearly
if
the
widow
would
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
(voice
overlap)
to
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
the
widow
would
necessarily
be
in
excess
of
the
actual
income
generated
by
trust
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
we
have
to
--
to
show,
your
honor,
that
it
really
was
clear
that
the
trust
could
never
produce
enough
income
to
meet
the
$300
per
month
payments
to
the
widow.
and
i
think
if
the
--
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
clear
the
trust
could
not
produce
enough
income
to
meet
those
payments,
then
it
would
be
proper
to
conclude
that
the
widow
was
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
the
internal
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
method
of
computation
used
by
the
court
below
here
is
entirely
inappropriate
not
only
because
it's
based
on
an
assumed
fixed
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
whereas
no
one
knows
what
this
corpus
is
going
to
yield
over
the
entire
remaining
lifetime
with
the
widow.
but
also
because
it
introduces
into
the
computation
the
widow's
life
expectancy.
so
that
the
value
of
the
widow's
right
to
receive
fixed
payments
and
therefore
the
size
of
the
specific
portion
under
petitioner's
contention
depends
upon
the
age
of
the
widow
at
the
death
of
her
husband.
the
younger
the
widow,
the
larger
the
marital
deduction.
and
we
submit
there's
no
support
in
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
to
justify
this
result.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
with
respect
that
--
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
that
the
$20,000
corpus
could
never
--
could
clearly
not
produce
enough
income
to
meet
the
monthly
payments
to
the
widow
in
order
to
conclude
that
the
widow
was
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
from
the
corpus
throughout
her
lifetime.
if
the
nature
of
the
property
was
such,
that
it
might
--
that
it's
income
might
rise
dramatically,
then
we
would
submit
that
it
would
--
would
be
improper
to
conclude
in
that
case
that
the
widow
would
be
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
from
--
from
the
trust
corpus.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor,
it's
clear
that
if
--
if
we
were
talking
about
the
value
of
a
remainder
or
indeed
the
value
of
an
annuity
that
had
to
be
included
in
gross
estate,
we
go
to
these
tables
to
do
so.
the
reason
that
it's
inappropriate
to
use
these
tables
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
widow
has
been
given
the
rights
of
virtual
ownership
in
a
portion
of
trust
property
that
are
prescribed
in
section
2056
(b)
(5).
it's
inappropriate
to
use
a
computation
that's
based
on
a
fixed
hypothetical
three
and
a
half
percent
yield.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
we
submit
basically,
your
honor,
this
--
this
is
not
a
question
of
valuation.
the
question
under
2056
(b)
(5)
is
whether
the
widow
received
the
rights
equivalent
to
virtual
ownership
in
an
identifiable
portion
of
that
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i'm
--
i'm
not
an
expert
on
pennsylvania
state
tax
law
but
i
would
assume
so,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
that
the
widow
takes
against
the
will
and
takes
an
absolute
interest
under
state
law,
that's
an
interest
passing
from
the
decedent
to
the
widow
that
would
qualify
for
marital
deduction.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
but
it's
not
unusual,
i
submit,
your
honor,
for
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
now,
i
--
i
think
--
it
would
--
could
take
against
the
will
the
interest
depending
upon
its
characteristics
under
state
law
could
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
--
the
full
value
of
the
trust
was
--
was
$69,000
and
if
under
state
law
she'd
be
taking
half
of
that,
it
would
be
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
petitioner
originally
claimed
the
full
value
of
the
trust
corpus
as
qualifying
for
the
marital
deduction.
and
then
relying
on
the
annuity
computation,
they
claimed
the
lower
amount
which
resulted
from
that
computation
of
$63,000.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
use
an
annuity
computation
of
this
kind
because
it's
based
on
the
fixed
three
and
a
half
percent
yield.
when
the
statute
says
the
widow
has
to
receive
all
the
income
from
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property,
it
surely
means
all
the
income
that
may
have
ultimately
be
generated
during
the
widow's
lifetime
and
not
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
merely
a
fixed
hypothetical
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
basically,
your
honor,
because
we
can't
point
to
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
because
it's
--
it's
extremely
difficult.
the
--
the
point
--
the
question
is
whether
the
widow
will
necessarily
receive
all
of
the
income
actually
generated
by
this
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
portion
of
the
trust
throughout
her
lifetime.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
under
those
circumstances,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
the
--
the
bequest
would
qualify
because
the
widow
would
be
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
all
of
the
trust
corpus
during
her
lifetime.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
i
think
it's
--
it's
very
difficult.
we're
talking
about
the
widow's
life
expectancy
here
which
is
--
she
was
42
at
the
death
of
the
decedent.
she
might
well
have
a
life
expectancy
of
another
25
years
and
i
think
it's
difficult
to
say
that
a
particular
trust
corpus
was
blackacre
could
not
increase
in
yield
over
that
life
expectancy.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
and
i
--
i
think
that
illustrates
the
--
the
necessity
to
utilize
a
fractional
share
approach
in
interpreting
a
specific
portion
because
in
order
to
ensure
the
widow
will
receive
the
rights
of
a
virtual
owner
in
any
portion
of
trust
property
that
qualifies
for
the
marital
deduction,
that
portion,
we
submit,
has
to
be
cast
in
terms
of
a
fractional
share
or
its
equivalent.
because
only
in
that
way
can
we
isolate
at
the
time
of
the
decedent's
death,
as
we
must,
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property
from
which
the
widow
will
necessarily
receive
all
of
the
income
throughout
her
lifetime.
if
we
take
a
bequest
such
as
blackacre,
if
the
widow
is
given
all
of
the
income
from
one
half
of
blackacre
plus
the
general
power
of
appointment
over
that
one
hand,
it's
clear
that
--
that
her
interest
--
this
bequest
will
qualify.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
i
am
--
i
am
assuring
in
this
case
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
we
have
blackacre
which
is
a
piece
of
real
property
and
i
take
it
the
corpus
of
the
trust
that
we're
dealing
with
here
consist
of
something
other
than
blackacre,
although
the
record
does
not
so
indicated.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
but
if
the
widow
is
given
the
$4,000
from
the
yield
of
blackacre
or
whatever
it
may
be,
and
in
the
first
year,
that
yield
is
$8,000,
at
that
point
the
widow
is
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
one
half.
but
if
at
some
point
in
the
future,
blackacre's
yield
rises
to
$16,000
then
the
widow
was
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
only
one
quarter.
and
if
the
yield
from
blackacre
continues
to
rise
over
the
life
of
the
widow,
eventually,
the
widow
may
be
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
only
a
very
small
portion
indeed
of
the
property
concerned.
and
therefore,
we
submit
only
requiring
as
the
regulations
do
that
the
widow's
income
interest
be
cast
in
terms
of
a
fractional
or
a
percentile
interest
or
its
equivalent.
will
it
be
possible
at
the
decedent's
death
to
isolate
a
specific
potion
of
the
trust
property
from
which
the
widow
will
receive
all
of
the
income
necessarily
throughout
her
lifetime?
justice
(inaudible)
would
and
it's
the
clear
the
language
of
section
2056
(b)
(5)
requires.
the
--
and
i
think
that
this
result
really
is
dictated
clearly
by
the
legislative
history
of
section
2056
(b)
(5).
the
congress
initially
enacted
the
marital
deduction
provisions
in
1948
to
equalize
the
estate
tax
effects
in
community
property
and
common
law
jurisdictions.
the
widow
in
the
community
property
estate
is
the
outright
owner
of
her
one
half
of
the
community
property.
therefore,
congress
felt
that
it
was
essential
to
ensure
that
any
property
transferred
to
a
widow
in
a
common
law
state
conveyed
to
the
widow
the
rights
of
virtual
ownership
if
that
bequest
was
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
congress
recognized
that
the
bequest
in
trust
are
used
very
often
in
common
law
states.
so
congress
provided
that
if
the
widow
is
given,
under
a
trust
instrument,
all
of
the
income
from
the
trust
corpus
during
her
lifetime
and
the
general
power
of
appointment
over
the
entire
corpus,
the
bequest
would
qualify
because
the
widow
had
two-key
characteristics
of
virtual
ownership.
her
income
would
necessarily
rise
and
fall
with
the
income
generator
by
the
trust
property
during
her
lifetime.
and
the
value
of
the
property
subject
to
her
power
of
appointment
would
rise
and
fall
with
changes
in
value
of
the
underlying
trust
assets.
and
this
principle
was
applied
in
1954
in
section
2056
(b)
(5)
with
respect
to
a
bequest
of
less
than
all
of
the
income
from
the
trust
corpus.
but
the
widow
did
have
to
receive,
clearly
under
the
statutory
language,
all
of
the
income
from
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
--
the
will
was
drawn
in
january
of
1957,
your
honor.
the
regulations
adopting
the
treasury's
interpretation
of
specific
portion
were
issued
in
1956,
october
16th
of
1956.
so
that
practitioners
were
aware
of
the
services'
interpretation
as
of
that
point.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
frankly,
your
honor,
the
problem
can
be
avoided
very
easily
through
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
mean
the
--
the
typical
mechanism
would
be
to
give
the
widow
all
of
the
income
from
a
specified
portion
of
the
trust
corpus
but
give
the
trustees
the
right
to
invade
corpus
if
necessary
to
bring
her
payments
up
to
a
state
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
would
think
that
a
provision
of
this
kind
would
not
--
not
be
unusual
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
now,
but
not
the
unusual..
i
think
it
would
not
be
uncommon
for
the
testator
to
want
to
assure
his
surviving
spouse
of
the
state
of
the
amount
of
--
of
current
income.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
there
are
a
number
of
ways
of
doing
it.
the
other
way
i
just
described
and
also,
you
could
say
the
widow
shall
receive
$6,000
per
year.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
--
that
the
practitioners
who
are
aware
of
the
service
position
on
issues
of
this
kind
would
not
fall
into
this
--
into
this
trap
of
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
your
honor,
the
problem
really
didn't
arise
until
the
--
until
the
specific
portion
language
was
introduced
into
the
marital
deduction
provision
in
1954.
and
the
service
promulgated
its
regulations
in
1956,
and
this
presumably
would
have
been
in
time
for
most
estate
planners
to
be
aware
of
the
services
position
in
time
to
make
the
necessary
adjustments.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
would
think
that
our
position
would
probably
have
to
be
the
same,
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
congress'
purpose
to
ensure
that
--
that
no
bequest
in
trust
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
unless
it
gave
to
the
surviving
spouse
an
interest
that
was
equivalent
to
the
interest
that
a
--
a
surviving
spouse
in
the
community
property
state
enjoys
in
her
share
of
community
property.
we
really
have
to
find
an
interest
in
the
trust
property
with
respect
to
wish
the
surviving
spouse
has
the
kind
of
rights
that
a
widow
in
a
community
property
state
has
in
her
share
of
community
property.
namely,
she
has
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
that
particular
portion
of
trust
property
whatever
the
future
fluctuations
of
the
income
may
be
over
her
lifetime.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
no,
the
--
well,
the
--
the
legislative
history
does
not
specifically
address
itself
to
elaborating
on
specific
portion.
but
it's
clear
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
purpose
was
to
ensure
that
no
portion
of
trust
property
would
qualify
unless
the
widow
were
given
the
rights
of
a
virtual
owner
in
that
particular
portion.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
1954,
congress
relaxed
that
to
the
extent
that
it
committed
a
portion
of
the
trust
property
to
qualify.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
--
the
requirement
from
of
all
the
trust
was
felt
to
serve
no
valid
purpose.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
that's
the
reason
why
the
specific
portion
language
was
introduced
in
1954.
we
submit,
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
in
--
in
eliminating
the
requirement
from
all
of
the
trust,
congress
did
not
inquire
to
relax
--
did
not
intend
to
relax
the
requirement
that
the
surviving
spouse
be
the
virtual
owner
of
any
portion
of
trust
property
that
was
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
and
we
submit
that
returning
to
the
question
of
computation,
that
any
method
of
computation
really
has
to
assume
some
fixed
constant
yield
of
the
trust
corpus
where
the
use
of
capitalization
method
or
an
annuity
method.
and
this
factor
makes
the
computations
incapable
of
isolating
a
specific
portion
of
a
variable
yield
trust
from
which
the
widow
will
necessarily
receive
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
income
during
her
lifetime.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
we
would
submit
that
--
that
a
method
of
computation
that
assumes
a
fixed
constant
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
when
in
fact
the
trust
corpus
yield
will
vary
here
can
serve
to
isolate
a
specific
portion
of
a
trust
corpus
from
which
the
widow
will
receive
all
of
the
income
to
be
generated
during
her
lifetime
and
that's
what's
wrong
with
these
computations.
as
long
as
we
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
but
the
three
and
a
half
percent
assumption
produces
an
extremely
high
marital
deduction
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
if
we're
talking
about
the
capitalization
approach.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
the
--
the
--
our
basic
call
with
the
annuity
computation
is
that
it
introduces
the
factor
of
the
widow's
life
expectancy.
it
means
the
size
of
the
specific
portion
is
going
to
depend
upon
the
--
the
age
of
the
window
at
the
death
of
her
decedent
husband.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
the
annuity
approach
assumes
that
both
income
and
corpus
would
be
paid
out
over
the
widow's
theoretical
life
expectancy
so
that
the
end
of
that
theoretical
period,
the
entire
corpus
would
be
exhausted.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
but
--
but
it's
built
in
to
the
annuity
computation,
the
assumption
of
the
yield
of
the
trust
would
be
a
fixed
three
and
a
half
percent
and
that's
surely
contrary
to
fact
and
it
prevents
the
computation
from
isolating
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property
from
which
the
widow
will
receive
all
of
the
income
during
her
lifetime
as
the
stature
requires.
the
petitioner
here
also
urges
that
since
the
property
will
be
included
in
the
widow's
gross
estate
at
the
time
of
her
death
as
a
result
of
her
general
power
of
appointment,
the
property
should
be
--
the
bequest
should
be
deemed
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
jackson
case,
the
determinative
factor
with
respect
to
deductibility
under
the
marital
deduction
is
not
includability
in
the
widow's
estate.
it's
true
that
most
interest
that
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
will
ultimately
be
included
in
the
widow's
estate
provided
she
hasn't
consumed
the
property
or
given
it
away
during
her
lifetime.
but
the
fact
that
the
property
will
be
included
in
her
gross
estate
at
her
death
is
not
by
itself
enough
to
qualify
the
bequest
for
the
marital
deduction.
the
petitioner
also
relies
here
on
the
gelb
case
decided
by
the
second
circuit.
we
submit
the
gelb
case
involved
a
different
issue
from
the
one
presented
here.
in
gelb,
it
was
clear
that
the
widow
was
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
trust
corpus.
so
the
income
requirement
of
2056
(b)
(5)
was
not
involved.
gelb
involved
whether
the
widow
had
a
general
power
of
appointment
over
the
specific
portion
of
the
corpus
itself.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
turns
on
whether
decedents
bequest
to
his
widow
a
fixed
monthly
payments
from
a
variable
yield
of
trust
constituted
the
bequest
of
all
the
income
from
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
as
section
2056
(b)
(5)
requires
if
that
bequest
is
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
the
key
words,
we
here
submit,
are
all
of
the
income
from
the
specific
portion
must
be
given
to
the
widow
if
the
bequest
to
her
is
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
the
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
section
2056
(b)
(5)
make
it
clear
that
congress
has
required
that
the
widow
be
given
all
the
income
from
a
specific
portion
or
trust
property
in
order
to
insure
that
she
will
have
the
rights
of
a
virtual
owner
in
that
portion,
in
order
to
insure
that
her
income
will
rise
and
fall
with
the
actual
income
generated
by
the
trust
property,
just
as
owners
would.
the
widow
must
receive
the
rights
of
a
virtual
owner
because
it
follows
from
congress'
intent
to
achieve
estate
tax
equality
between
common-law
and
community
property
states
that
a
bequest
of
trust
income
to
a
widow
in
a
common-law
state
should
not
be
tax-exempt
unless
the
widow
receives
rights
equivalent
to
those
enjoyed
by
a
spouse
in
a
community
property
state
in
her
share
of
the
community
property.
now,
the
petitioner
here
argues
that
since
the
value
of
the
widow's
right
to
receive
fixed
payments
can
be
estimated
through
an
annuity
computation
based
on
various
arbitrary
assumptions,
that
estimated
value
that
can
be
considered
a
qualifying
specific
portion
under
the
statute.
we
submit
that
whether
a
bequest
in
trust
qualifies
under
section
2056(b)
(5)
turns
not
on
whether
the
widow's
interest
can
be
valued
but
on
whether
the
widow
has
been
given
the
right's
equivalent
to
virtual
ownership
that
are
specified
in
section
2056(b)
(5)
including
the
right
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
a
most
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property
during
her
lifetime.
furthermore
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
--
the
basic
objective,
your
honor,
of
the
--
of
the
marital
--
of
this
particular
section,
section
2056
(b)
(5)
was
to
give
the
--
the
estate
a
marital
deduction
for
a
portion
of
trust
property
if
the
widow
received
in
that
portion
of
trust
property
the
rights
of
virtual
ownership.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
it
was
necessarily
to
do
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
you're
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor,
i
guess
that's
--
basically,
from
the
congressional
purpose
to
equalize
the
estate
tax
effects
and
community
property
in
common-law
states,
congress
wanted
to
ensure
that
a
bequest
of
trust
income
to
a
widow
and
a
common-law
state
should
not
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
unless
the
widow
received
rights
that
were
equivalent
to
the
outright
ownership
enjoyed
in
--
in
--
by
a
spouse
in
a
community
property
state
in
her
share
of
the
community
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
she
had
a
power
of
appointment
over
the
entire
corpus.
and
the
problem
is
whether,
like
an
owner,
she
had
the
right
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
an
identifiable
portion
of
trust
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
no
--
your
honor,
with
respect
the
court
below
held
that
while
the
trust
had
not
generated
enough
income
to
produce
the
$300
per
month
payments,
the
--
the
corpus
was
capable
of
producing
that
much
income.
therefore
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
sir.
the
court
specially
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
five
and
a
half
percent
interest
on
the
initial
value
of
the
corpus
would
have
produced
enough
to
make
these
payments
to
the
widow.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
court
below
held
that
for
that
reason,
because
the
--
because
the
corpus
was
capable
of
producing
more
than
the
income
required
to
produce
the
$300
per
month
payments,
the
widow
was
not
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
corpus.
it's
quite
impossible
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor,
that
indicates
what
the
precise
yield
of
the
corpus
was.
and
i
take
it
the
court
reached
this
finding
on
the
basis
of
its
reduction
that
the
corpuses
$70,000
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
could
be
capable
of
producing
more
than
$3,600,
if
not
now,
then
at
some
point
in
the
future.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
the
statute
clearly
requires
that
the
widow
be
entitled
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
trust
corpus
throughout
her
lifetime.
and
in
the
period
of
rising
values,
it's
--
it's
entirely
possible
that
a
trust
corpus
of
this
magnitude
would
produce
more
than
enough
income
to
enable
payment
of
the
$300
per
month,
at
which
point
the
excess
income
would
be
accumulated.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
--
your
honor,
in
a
case
as
clear
as
that,
it
would
be
--
and
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
widow
would
be
entitled
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
corpus.
so
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
therefore
the
entire
value
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
regulations
in
requiring
that
a
specific
portion
be
cast
in
terms
of
a
fractional
share
or
its
equivalent
don't
require
that
the
magic
language
of
fractional
share
or
percentile
interest
be
used.
i
think
in
your
example
in
which
you
got
a
fixed
yield
trust,
in
which
the
widow
is
to
receive
the
former
fixed
payments
half
the
income
generated
by
the
trust,
we
would
clearly
have
a
bequest
to
the
widow
that
would
be
the
equivalent
to
a
fractional
share
that
they
wouldn't
have.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
we
--
we
submit
that
at
the
decedent's
death,
we
have
to
be
able
to
point
to
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property
from
which
the
widow
will
receive
all
of
the
income
that's
actually
generated
through
her
lifetime.
now,
the
petitioner
suggest
that
we
can
use
an
annuity
evaluation
to
isolate
a
specific
portion.
we
submit
that
since
the
annuity
computation
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
corpus
will
have
a
fixed
constant
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
whereas
in
fact,
the
yield
from
this
trust
corpus
is
going
to
vary.
now,
that
computation
cannot
serve
to
isolate
a
specific
portion
of
this
trust
corpus
from
which
the
widow
will
necessarily
receive
all
of
the
income
throughout
her
lifetime
as
an
owner
would
and
as
we
submit
the
statute
clearly
requires.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor,
and
certainly,
the
--
the
use
of
this
kind
of
computation
to
figure
out
the
value
of
a
--
an
interest
such
as
a
remainder
or
annuity
that
has
to
be
included
in
a
gross
estate
is
entirely
appropriate
and
--
and
extremely
helpful.
we
submit,
however,
that
this
kind
of
a
computation
based
on
an
assumed
fixed
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
is
entirely
inappropriate
when
the
question
is
whether
the
widow
was
given
the
rights
of
virtual
ownership
prescribed
in
section
2056
(b)
(5).
it's
inappropriate
because
the
annuity
assumes
a
fixed
constant
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
whereas
in
fact
no
one
knows
what
yield
of
this
trust
will
be
over
the
future.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
your
honor,
actually
two
techniques
of
valuation
of
the
widow's
rights
have
been
used
by
the
lower
courts.
the
court
in
this
case
used
an
annuity
computation
which
resulted
in
a
$63,000
specific
portion.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
approved
the
capitalization
approach.
under
the
annuity
approaches
by
the
court
below,
a
computation
is
made
of
the
amount
of
corpus
that
would
be
required
to
pay
an
annuity
of
$300
per
month
over
the
theoretical
life
expectancy
of
the
widow
using
both
the
corpus
and
the
income
at
an
assumed
fixed
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
on
the
assumption
of
the
corpus
would
be
exhausted
at
the
end
of
the
theoretical
life
expectancy
of
the
widow.
the
capitalization
approach
has
been
used
by
the
district
court
in
the
citizen's
national
bank,
which
is
pending
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
here
and
which
was
approved
by
the
seventh
circuit,
involves
simply
a
computation
of
the
amount
of
the
corpus
which
at
a
fixed
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
would
throw
off
$300
per
month
assuming
no
exhaustion
or
diminution
of
the
corpus.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
in
this
case,
that
would
--
that
would
result
with
--
the
capitalization
approach
would
result
in
a
valuation
of
$103,000
for
the
widow's
right
to
receive
fixed
payments.
of
course,
this
vastly
an
excess
of
the
full
value
of
the
trust
corpus,
$69,000.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
that
--
in
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
in
a
period
of
rising
values,
it's
difficult
to
predict
what
the
future
yield
of
a
particular
piece
of
property
will
be.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
your
honor,
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
clear
that
the
trust
corpus
would
not
generate
enough
income
to
produce
the
fixed
monthly
payments,
then
it
would
be
proper
to
conclude
that
the
widow
was
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
trust
corpus.
therefore,
the
entire
trust
corpus
would
qualify
for
marital
deduction.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
clearly
if
the
widow
would
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
(voice
overlap)
to
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
the
widow
would
necessarily
be
in
excess
of
the
actual
income
generated
by
trust
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
we
have
to
--
to
show,
your
honor,
that
it
really
was
clear
that
the
trust
could
never
produce
enough
income
to
meet
the
$300
per
month
payments
to
the
widow.
and
i
think
if
the
--
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
clear
the
trust
could
not
produce
enough
income
to
meet
those
payments,
then
it
would
be
proper
to
conclude
that
the
widow
was
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
the
internal
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
method
of
computation
used
by
the
court
below
here
is
entirely
inappropriate
not
only
because
it's
based
on
an
assumed
fixed
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
whereas
no
one
knows
what
this
corpus
is
going
to
yield
over
the
entire
remaining
lifetime
with
the
widow.
but
also
because
it
introduces
into
the
computation
the
widow's
life
expectancy.
so
that
the
value
of
the
widow's
right
to
receive
fixed
payments
and
therefore
the
size
of
the
specific
portion
under
petitioner's
contention
depends
upon
the
age
of
the
widow
at
the
death
of
her
husband.
the
younger
the
widow,
the
larger
the
marital
deduction.
and
we
submit
there's
no
support
in
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
to
justify
this
result.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
with
respect
that
--
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
that
the
$20,000
corpus
could
never
--
could
clearly
not
produce
enough
income
to
meet
the
monthly
payments
to
the
widow
in
order
to
conclude
that
the
widow
was
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
from
the
corpus
throughout
her
lifetime.
if
the
nature
of
the
property
was
such,
that
it
might
--
that
it's
income
might
rise
dramatically,
then
we
would
submit
that
it
would
--
would
be
improper
to
conclude
in
that
case
that
the
widow
would
be
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
from
--
from
the
trust
corpus.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor,
it's
clear
that
if
--
if
we
were
talking
about
the
value
of
a
remainder
or
indeed
the
value
of
an
annuity
that
had
to
be
included
in
gross
estate,
we
go
to
these
tables
to
do
so.
the
reason
that
it's
inappropriate
to
use
these
tables
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
widow
has
been
given
the
rights
of
virtual
ownership
in
a
portion
of
trust
property
that
are
prescribed
in
section
2056
(b)
(5).
it's
inappropriate
to
use
a
computation
that's
based
on
a
fixed
hypothetical
three
and
a
half
percent
yield.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
we
submit
basically,
your
honor,
this
--
this
is
not
a
question
of
valuation.
the
question
under
2056
(b)
(5)
is
whether
the
widow
received
the
rights
equivalent
to
virtual
ownership
in
an
identifiable
portion
of
that
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i'm
--
i'm
not
an
expert
on
pennsylvania
state
tax
law
but
i
would
assume
so,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
that
the
widow
takes
against
the
will
and
takes
an
absolute
interest
under
state
law,
that's
an
interest
passing
from
the
decedent
to
the
widow
that
would
qualify
for
marital
deduction.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
but
it's
not
unusual,
i
submit,
your
honor,
for
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
now,
i
--
i
think
--
it
would
--
could
take
against
the
will
the
interest
depending
upon
its
characteristics
under
state
law
could
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
--
the
full
value
of
the
trust
was
--
was
$69,000
and
if
under
state
law
she'd
be
taking
half
of
that,
it
would
be
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
petitioner
originally
claimed
the
full
value
of
the
trust
corpus
as
qualifying
for
the
marital
deduction.
and
then
relying
on
the
annuity
computation,
they
claimed
the
lower
amount
which
resulted
from
that
computation
of
$63,000.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
use
an
annuity
computation
of
this
kind
because
it's
based
on
the
fixed
three
and
a
half
percent
yield.
when
the
statute
says
the
widow
has
to
receive
all
the
income
from
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property,
it
surely
means
all
the
income
that
may
have
ultimately
be
generated
during
the
widow's
lifetime
and
not
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
merely
a
fixed
hypothetical
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
basically,
your
honor,
because
we
can't
point
to
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
because
it's
--
it's
extremely
difficult.
the
--
the
point
--
the
question
is
whether
the
widow
will
necessarily
receive
all
of
the
income
actually
generated
by
this
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
portion
of
the
trust
throughout
her
lifetime.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
under
those
circumstances,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
the
--
the
bequest
would
qualify
because
the
widow
would
be
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
all
of
the
trust
corpus
during
her
lifetime.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
i
think
it's
--
it's
very
difficult.
we're
talking
about
the
widow's
life
expectancy
here
which
is
--
she
was
42
at
the
death
of
the
decedent.
she
might
well
have
a
life
expectancy
of
another
25
years
and
i
think
it's
difficult
to
say
that
a
particular
trust
corpus
was
blackacre
could
not
increase
in
yield
over
that
life
expectancy.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
and
i
--
i
think
that
illustrates
the
--
the
necessity
to
utilize
a
fractional
share
approach
in
interpreting
a
specific
portion
because
in
order
to
ensure
the
widow
will
receive
the
rights
of
a
virtual
owner
in
any
portion
of
trust
property
that
qualifies
for
the
marital
deduction,
that
portion,
we
submit,
has
to
be
cast
in
terms
of
a
fractional
share
or
its
equivalent.
because
only
in
that
way
can
we
isolate
at
the
time
of
the
decedent's
death,
as
we
must,
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property
from
which
the
widow
will
necessarily
receive
all
of
the
income
throughout
her
lifetime.
if
we
take
a
bequest
such
as
blackacre,
if
the
widow
is
given
all
of
the
income
from
one
half
of
blackacre
plus
the
general
power
of
appointment
over
that
one
hand,
it's
clear
that
--
that
her
interest
--
this
bequest
will
qualify.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
i
am
--
i
am
assuring
in
this
case
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
we
have
blackacre
which
is
a
piece
of
real
property
and
i
take
it
the
corpus
of
the
trust
that
we're
dealing
with
here
consist
of
something
other
than
blackacre,
although
the
record
does
not
so
indicated.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
but
if
the
widow
is
given
the
$4,000
from
the
yield
of
blackacre
or
whatever
it
may
be,
and
in
the
first
year,
that
yield
is
$8,000,
at
that
point
the
widow
is
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
one
half.
but
if
at
some
point
in
the
future,
blackacre's
yield
rises
to
$16,000
then
the
widow
was
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
only
one
quarter.
and
if
the
yield
from
blackacre
continues
to
rise
over
the
life
of
the
widow,
eventually,
the
widow
may
be
receiving
all
of
the
income
from
only
a
very
small
portion
indeed
of
the
property
concerned.
and
therefore,
we
submit
only
requiring
as
the
regulations
do
that
the
widow's
income
interest
be
cast
in
terms
of
a
fractional
or
a
percentile
interest
or
its
equivalent.
will
it
be
possible
at
the
decedent's
death
to
isolate
a
specific
potion
of
the
trust
property
from
which
the
widow
will
receive
all
of
the
income
necessarily
throughout
her
lifetime?
justice
(inaudible)
would
and
it's
the
clear
the
language
of
section
2056
(b)
(5)
requires.
the
--
and
i
think
that
this
result
really
is
dictated
clearly
by
the
legislative
history
of
section
2056
(b)
(5).
the
congress
initially
enacted
the
marital
deduction
provisions
in
1948
to
equalize
the
estate
tax
effects
in
community
property
and
common
law
jurisdictions.
the
widow
in
the
community
property
estate
is
the
outright
owner
of
her
one
half
of
the
community
property.
therefore,
congress
felt
that
it
was
essential
to
ensure
that
any
property
transferred
to
a
widow
in
a
common
law
state
conveyed
to
the
widow
the
rights
of
virtual
ownership
if
that
bequest
was
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
congress
recognized
that
the
bequest
in
trust
are
used
very
often
in
common
law
states.
so
congress
provided
that
if
the
widow
is
given,
under
a
trust
instrument,
all
of
the
income
from
the
trust
corpus
during
her
lifetime
and
the
general
power
of
appointment
over
the
entire
corpus,
the
bequest
would
qualify
because
the
widow
had
two-key
characteristics
of
virtual
ownership.
her
income
would
necessarily
rise
and
fall
with
the
income
generator
by
the
trust
property
during
her
lifetime.
and
the
value
of
the
property
subject
to
her
power
of
appointment
would
rise
and
fall
with
changes
in
value
of
the
underlying
trust
assets.
and
this
principle
was
applied
in
1954
in
section
2056
(b)
(5)
with
respect
to
a
bequest
of
less
than
all
of
the
income
from
the
trust
corpus.
but
the
widow
did
have
to
receive,
clearly
under
the
statutory
language,
all
of
the
income
from
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
--
the
will
was
drawn
in
january
of
1957,
your
honor.
the
regulations
adopting
the
treasury's
interpretation
of
specific
portion
were
issued
in
1956,
october
16th
of
1956.
so
that
practitioners
were
aware
of
the
services'
interpretation
as
of
that
point.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
frankly,
your
honor,
the
problem
can
be
avoided
very
easily
through
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
mean
the
--
the
typical
mechanism
would
be
to
give
the
widow
all
of
the
income
from
a
specified
portion
of
the
trust
corpus
but
give
the
trustees
the
right
to
invade
corpus
if
necessary
to
bring
her
payments
up
to
a
state
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
would
think
that
a
provision
of
this
kind
would
not
--
not
be
unusual
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
now,
but
not
the
unusual..
i
think
it
would
not
be
uncommon
for
the
testator
to
want
to
assure
his
surviving
spouse
of
the
state
of
the
amount
of
--
of
current
income.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
there
are
a
number
of
ways
of
doing
it.
the
other
way
i
just
described
and
also,
you
could
say
the
widow
shall
receive
$6,000
per
year.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
--
that
the
practitioners
who
are
aware
of
the
service
position
on
issues
of
this
kind
would
not
fall
into
this
--
into
this
trap
of
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
your
honor,
the
problem
really
didn't
arise
until
the
--
until
the
specific
portion
language
was
introduced
into
the
marital
deduction
provision
in
1954.
and
the
service
promulgated
its
regulations
in
1956,
and
this
presumably
would
have
been
in
time
for
most
estate
planners
to
be
aware
of
the
services
position
in
time
to
make
the
necessary
adjustments.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
i
would
think
that
our
position
would
probably
have
to
be
the
same,
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
congress'
purpose
to
ensure
that
--
that
no
bequest
in
trust
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
unless
it
gave
to
the
surviving
spouse
an
interest
that
was
equivalent
to
the
interest
that
a
--
a
surviving
spouse
in
the
community
property
state
enjoys
in
her
share
of
community
property.
we
really
have
to
find
an
interest
in
the
trust
property
with
respect
to
wish
the
surviving
spouse
has
the
kind
of
rights
that
a
widow
in
a
community
property
state
has
in
her
share
of
community
property.
namely,
she
has
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
that
particular
portion
of
trust
property
whatever
the
future
fluctuations
of
the
income
may
be
over
her
lifetime.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
no,
the
--
well,
the
--
the
legislative
history
does
not
specifically
address
itself
to
elaborating
on
specific
portion.
but
it's
clear
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
purpose
was
to
ensure
that
no
portion
of
trust
property
would
qualify
unless
the
widow
were
given
the
rights
of
a
virtual
owner
in
that
particular
portion.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
1954,
congress
relaxed
that
to
the
extent
that
it
committed
a
portion
of
the
trust
property
to
qualify.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
the
--
the
requirement
from
of
all
the
trust
was
felt
to
serve
no
valid
purpose.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
that's
the
reason
why
the
specific
portion
language
was
introduced
in
1954.
we
submit,
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
in
--
in
eliminating
the
requirement
from
all
of
the
trust,
congress
did
not
inquire
to
relax
--
did
not
intend
to
relax
the
requirement
that
the
surviving
spouse
be
the
virtual
owner
of
any
portion
of
trust
property
that
was
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
and
we
submit
that
returning
to
the
question
of
computation,
that
any
method
of
computation
really
has
to
assume
some
fixed
constant
yield
of
the
trust
corpus
where
the
use
of
capitalization
method
or
an
annuity
method.
and
this
factor
makes
the
computations
incapable
of
isolating
a
specific
portion
of
a
variable
yield
trust
from
which
the
widow
will
necessarily
receive
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
income
during
her
lifetime.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
we
would
submit
that
--
that
a
method
of
computation
that
assumes
a
fixed
constant
yield
of
three
and
a
half
percent
when
in
fact
the
trust
corpus
yield
will
vary
here
can
serve
to
isolate
a
specific
portion
of
a
trust
corpus
from
which
the
widow
will
receive
all
of
the
income
to
be
generated
during
her
lifetime
and
that's
what's
wrong
with
these
computations.
as
long
as
we
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
but
the
three
and
a
half
percent
assumption
produces
an
extremely
high
marital
deduction
--
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
--
if
we're
talking
about
the
capitalization
approach.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
well,
the
--
the
--
our
basic
call
with
the
annuity
computation
is
that
it
introduces
the
factor
of
the
widow's
life
expectancy.
it
means
the
size
of
the
specific
portion
is
going
to
depend
upon
the
--
the
age
of
the
window
at
the
death
of
her
decedent
husband.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
yes,
the
annuity
approach
assumes
that
both
income
and
corpus
would
be
paid
out
over
the
widow's
theoretical
life
expectancy
so
that
the
end
of
that
theoretical
period,
the
entire
corpus
would
be
exhausted.
mr.
richard
c.
pugh
but
--
but
it's
built
in
to
the
annuity
computation,
the
assumption
of
the
yield
of
the
trust
would
be
a
fixed
three
and
a
half
percent
and
that's
surely
contrary
to
fact
and
it
prevents
the
computation
from
isolating
a
specific
portion
of
the
trust
property
from
which
the
widow
will
receive
all
of
the
income
during
her
lifetime
as
the
stature
requires.
the
petitioner
here
also
urges
that
since
the
property
will
be
included
in
the
widow's
gross
estate
at
the
time
of
her
death
as
a
result
of
her
general
power
of
appointment,
the
property
should
be
--
the
bequest
should
be
deemed
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
jackson
case,
the
determinative
factor
with
respect
to
deductibility
under
the
marital
deduction
is
not
includability
in
the
widow's
estate.
it's
true
that
most
interest
that
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
will
ultimately
be
included
in
the
widow's
estate
provided
she
hasn't
consumed
the
property
or
given
it
away
during
her
lifetime.
but
the
fact
that
the
property
will
be
included
in
her
gross
estate
at
her
death
is
not
by
itself
enough
to
qualify
the
bequest
for
the
marital
deduction.
the
petitioner
also
relies
here
on
the
gelb
case
decided
by
the
second
circuit.
we
submit
the
gelb
case
involved
a
different
issue
from
the
one
presented
here.
in
gelb,
it
was
clear
that
the
widow
was
to
receive
all
of
the
income
from
the
entire
trust
corpus.
so
the
income
requirement
of
2056
(b)
(5)
was
not
involved.
gelb
involved
whether
the
widow
had
a
general
power
of
appointment
over
the
specific
portion
of
the
corpus
itself.
