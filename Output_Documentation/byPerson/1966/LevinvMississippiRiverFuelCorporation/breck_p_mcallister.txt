mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
i’ll
come
to
it
at
once
is
whether
these
shareholders
in
missouri
pacific
railroad
mopac
as
it
is
generally
called,
there
are
39,000
outstanding
shares
and
petitioners
here
represent
a
majority
of
them.
whether
these
petitioners
have
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
don’t
mr.
justice
white.
we
really
don’t
have
those
records,
the
railroad
would
have
those
records,
we
hold
a
majority.
the
question
is
whether
we
have
the
right
to
vote
separately
as
a
b
class
on
a
proposed
consolidation
proposed
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
railroad
and
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
whether
we
have
this
right
to
vote
separately
under
section
5
and
the
parenthetical
clause
of
paragraph
11
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
a
shareholders
numbered
1,800,000
in
each
of
these
shares
has
one
vote.
we’re
constantly
told
by
the
respondents
and
i
want
to
make
this
clear
at
the
outset
that
we
have
sort
of
a
tiny
minuscule
interest
because
we
have
only
2%
of
the
number
of
the
votes,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
our
participating
interest
in
the
company
even
three
years
ago
exceeded
that
of
the
a
shareholders.
today,
we
have
an
interest
of
some
$260
million
compared
to
the
interest,
fixed
interest
of
the
a
group
of
a
$180
million.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
precisely.
and
that
brings
me
at
once
really
mr.
justice
white
what
is
this
a
&
b
business,
what
are
these
a
and
b
shares,
how
do
they
come
about?
and
they
came
about
as
a
result
of
the
final
plan
and
reorganization
of
mopac
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
back
in
1954
and
this
plan
was
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
was
approved
and
confirmed
by
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
now
it
is
this
plan
that
created
these
two
groups
of
stock,
the
a
shares,
the
1,800,000
of
them
were
provided
for
in
the
plan
to
compensate
fully,
the
former
preferred
shareholders
not
only
for
the
par
of
their
preferred
stock,
but
also
for
unpaid
cumulative
dividend,
they’d
pay
it
in
full
and
their
dividend
under
the
a
shares
is
a
$5
maximum
and
their
interest
is
$100.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
and
by
the,
and
confirmed
by
the
reorganization
court.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
is
correct.
each
of
these
shares
is
entitled
to
one
vote,
each
of
the
1,800,000
shares
and
a
maximum
dividend
of
$5.
and
these
a
shares
have
the
characteristics,
we
submit
of
a
preferred
stock.
now
the
b
shares
were
issued
to
the
old
common
stockholders
and
these
b
shares
have
the
characteristics
of
a
common
shareholder.
the
situation
that
developed
under
this
plan
was
that
with
the
a
group
holding
98%
of
the
number
of
shares
than
the
b
group,
they
may
have
2%.
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
the
a,
--
the
b
group
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
a
group
and
here
comes
the
protective
clause
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
directed,
they
included
in
the
charter
of
mopac
and
this
was
part
of
the
reorganization
plan
and
it
was
inserted
at
the
direction
of
commission.
and
the
essence
of
this
protective
clause
is
that
the
company
shall
not
do
certain
things
without
a
majority
vote
of
each
class
of
stock
to
protective
clause
and
the
point
that
we
passing
on
is
that
the
company
shall
not
offer
or
change
the
preferences
and
the
special
or
relative
rights
of
the
a
or
the
b.
now
this
is
where
our
claim
for
a
separate
vote
begins
in
the
charter,
in
this
protective
clause.
now
the
respondents
say
that
this
generally
voted
clause
doesn’t
apply
to
us
because
this
is
a
consolidation
and
the
clause
doesn’t
use
the
word
consolidation.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
icc
required
that
this
protective
clause
be
included.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no,
no,
no,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
it’s
pending
there,
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
now
our
first
question
of
course
is,
does
this
propose
a
plan,
and
let
me
put
the
plan
in
a
capsule,
this
is
no
penn
central,
this
is
a
plan
under
which
mopac
proposes
to
consolidate
its
properties,
and
the
properties
of
a
83%
owned
subsidiary
texas
pacific
and
create
a
new
corporation
which
these
properties
would
be
transferred,
a
new
delaware
corporation
and
that’s
all
it
is.
and
in
a
moment,
i
want
to
show
now
how
this
plan,
there’s
a
little
more
to
it
than
that
that
does
affect
an
alteration
or
change
in
our
relevant
right.
what
the
plan
does
is
to
issue
new
shares
of
the
new
corporation
to
the
old
shareholder,
the
a
and
b
as
though
their
interest
were
identical.
i
suggested
the
a
is
a
really
preferred
stock
and
b
is
a
common
stock
and
they
treat
us
as
though
we
were
one,
we
are
not,
as
i
indicated
already.
and
this
is
where
the
alteration
or
change
takes
place.
the
district
court
thought
this
was
so
obvious
it
wasn’t
worth
talking
about;
i
wanted
to
speak
it
to
this
court
so
that
the
full
impact
of
this
plan
would
be
apparent
and
perfectly
clear.
now,
this
is
the
issue
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
right.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
exactly.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
it’s
four
to
one,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
is
correct,
exactly,
$25
for
common
stock.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
correct.
now,
this
issue
comes
before
this
court,
now
i’d
like
to
say
it
very
briefly
in
this
way,
and
at
this
time
because
mopac
submitted
its
plan
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
this
plan
and
in
december
of
1963
before
filing
it,
it
held
a
meeting
of
its
board
and
authorized
a
plan
and
all
of
that
and
in
january
of
1964
it
filed
a
plan
with
the
commission.
and
in
that
filing,
it
announced
that
this
would
be
submitted
to
the
shareholders
of
mopac
that
the
forthcoming
annual
meeting
in
may
of
1964
or
at
a
special
meeting
to
be
called
sooner,
at
which
the
plan
would
be
submitted
to
the
aggregate
vote
of
all
of
the
shareholders.
now
this
made
it
very
clear
to
us
that
the
requirement
of
a
separate
vote
of
these
shareholders
in
the
charter
which
i
shall
come
to
in
one
moment
was
being
disregarded,
that
we
would
better
get
busy
and
go
to
court
and
find
out
what
our
rights
were
and
we
did.
this
announcement
by
mopac
precipitated
the
action
of
which
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
is
based
on
diversity
of
the
citizenship
and
we
filed
our
action
in
the
district
court
of
missouri.
these
complaints
adequately
stated
the
facts
apparently
because
they
were
met
with
motions
to
dismiss
so
the
cases
hereon
motions
to
dismiss
the
complaints,
the
district
court
denied
these
motions,
upheld
our
position
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
i
like
to
state
now
what
it
is
about
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
that
we
believe
requires
reversal
and
the
important
policy
considerations
that
were
ignored
we
think
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
our
claim
is
parallel
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
treatment
of
section
511
and
really
only
the
parenthetical
clause
of
section
511
which
gives
effect
to
applicable
state
law
to
determine
the
vote
that
is
required,
the
assent
of
the
shareholders
as
its
put
to
accomplish
a
consolidation
really
any
consolidation.
this
court
has
had
occasion
often
to
refer
to
the
federal
policy
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
facilitate
consolidation
emergence
in
the
national
transportation
system,
but
this
court
has
also
adverted
to
the
further
requirement
of
section
511
that
there
be
assent
of
the
shareholder.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
the
assent
of
the
shareholders
and
if
that
vote
of
the
shareholders
in
favor
of
the
merger
or
consolidation
is
not
forthcoming,
there
will
be
no
such
consolidation
and
it
really
doesn’t
matter
whether
we
are
talking
about
penn
central
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
this
rather
limited
operation
of
mopac.
this
is
a
conventional
policy,
it
stands
with
the
same
dignity
we
submit
as
the
policy
to
facilitate
consolidation
and
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
national
transportation
policy
as
provided
by
the
congress
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
we
stand
on
it
and
submit
that
it
should
be
given
effect
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do.
now,
our
case
of
course
starts
with
this
charter
that
i’ve
talked
about
before.
we
think
this
charter
is
perfectly
straight
forward
in
giving
us
a
right
to
vote
separately
in
the
event
of
any
operation
or
change
of
our
relative
rights.
we
think
it
is.
we
think
the
missouri
statutes
which
give
effect
to
that
charter
requirement
are
straightforward
and
we
think
section
511
seems
to
us
to
be
a
simple
enough
requirement
that
applicable
state
law
shall
be
applied
here
and
this
is
the
error
we
claim,
we
claim
that
the
court
of
appeals
reached
its
decision
of
by
taking
the
first
policy
that
i
mentioned,
that
is
the
overall
policy
to
facilitate
consolidations
and
mergers
in
the
transportation
system
of
this
country,
took
that
policy
to
smother
the
--
we
think
equally
important
policy
of
giving
effect
to
applicable
state
law
to
determine
the
assent
of
shareholders.
this
part
of
our
policy.
this
is
not
a
compulsory
system
of
consolidation.
it
requires
the
assent
of
the
shareholders.
now
the
court
of
appeals
was
very
clear
in
saying
that
it
was
its
concept
of
the
federal
policy
that
moved
it
to
the
decision
it
reached
it
said
so
very
plainly
and
i
should
like
to
read
only
a
sentence
from
the
very
end
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
of
course,
we
think
the
district
court
decided
the
question
of
state
law
that
was
what
it
was
called
upon
to
do
what
is
the
applicable
state
law
here.
what
is
the
law
of
missouri
on
this
point?
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
this,
they
said
that
the
question
before
them
was
primarily
a
matter
of
the
interpretation
of
section
511,
rather
than
of
missouri
law,
and
they
said
that
our
difference
with
the
district
court
relates
to
this
statute,
section
511
and
the
national
transportation
policy
and
we
think
this
was
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
requires
reversal.
now,
i
want
to
come
now
to
what
are
we
asking
of
this
court.
if
i
were
you
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no,
we
would
not
mr.
justice
black,
because
they
did
not
give
effect
to
the
recognition
of
what
is
called
applicable
state
law
at
all.
they
were
so
impressed
if
you
like
with
the
importance
as
they
saw
it
of
the
national
--
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
we
thought
not
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
in
our
view
the
--
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
rated
it
differently,
but
i
should
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
point
where
they
seem
to
be
resolving
the
various
points,
the
court
of
appeals
speaks
at
length
of
this
consideration
and
that
consideration
and
so
on
and
i
would
think
that
on
the
record
of
page
157
mr.
justice
brennan
the
end
of
that
long
paragraph,
the
court
there
says
that
they
are
compelled
to
resolve
that
doubt
that
they
seem
to
be
expressing
on
the
side
of
those
provisions
of
the
statute
which
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
511,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
of
the
statute
which
speak
the
rule
and
that
is
the
majority
vote
now
i
have
not
mentioned
section
511
provides
for
a
majority
vote
unless
applicable
state
law
provides.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
maybe.
i
think
it’s
very
difficult
to
tell
just
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
doing
here
and
that’s
our
trouble
with
it.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
but
the
district
court
did
mr.
justice
white
and
we
don’t
find
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
overturned
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
the
state
law
because
the
court
of
appeals
went
off,
we
think
on
the
points
of
federal
law
which
we
believe
were
erroneous.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
that
would
have
been
obvious,
in
the
easy
case,
but
we
think
of
course
that
--
to
turn
to
the
state
law
point
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
we
just
don’t
read
it
that
way
because
and
i’d
like
to
refer
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
but
if
you
look
at
the
very
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
appears
on
page
158
of
the
record,
the
very
last
paragraph
number
two,
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
this
--
the
question
here
is
a
matter
which
primarily
concerns
the
interpretation
of
511
a
federal
statute.
and
despite
its
interplay
with
missouri
laws,
the
court
says
very
plainly
i
think
there
that
our
difference
with
the
district
court
relates
to
this
statute
that’s
511
and
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
i
think
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
i
think
this
mr.
justice
white,
the
district
court
didn’t
really
consider
the
federal
points
at
all,
it
applied
itself
to
the
state
law
point.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
as
the,
as
indeed
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
now
this
is
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
this
is
precisely
what
i
want
to
come
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no,
i
have
not
mr.
justice
black
because
i
think
section
5(11)
really
precludes
that,
i
think
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
oh,
i
think
that
would
if
the
statute
was
like
that,
there
is
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
would
answer
that
this
way
mr.
justice
black,
that
is
not
our
case
because
we
asking
here
for
a
right
to
vote.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
and
that
is
precisely
why
we’re
in
court.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
would
indeed
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
black.
with
this
additional
point,
i
think
and
that
is
that
we
find
here
a
federal
statue
that
does
in
section
5(11)
recognize
the
requirement
of
stockholder
assent.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
the
assent,
the
consent
or
the
vote
of
the
stockholders
and
this
vote
is
to
be
whatever
applicable
state
law
maybe
and
this
is
all
we
are
asking,
we
are
asking
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes.
it
is
--
it
appears
on
appendix
a
page
1(a)
of
our
main
brief.
the
relevant
provision
is
that
this
consolidation
and
so
forth
shall
not
take
place,
without
the
vote
of
a
majority.
now,
this
is
a
federal
rule
and
the
important
part
that
we
stress
is
unless
a
different
vote
is
required
under
applicable
state
law.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
those
are
the
words
of
section
5(11)
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
we
do
and
if
the
word
be
singular
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
we
object,
we’re
not
claiming
it’s
unconstitutional,
but
we’re
claiming
that
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
i
don’t
think
it
would
be.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
the
statue
5(11)
refers
to
the
number
so
required
and
i
think
mr.
justice
black
if
i
understood
you
correctly
you
were
concerned
less
the
a
shares
were
in
a
position
to
vote
the
entire
aggregate
vote
and
we
could
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well
that
is
--
we
think
that
the
construction
urged
by
the
respondents
here
bumps
right
into
that
kind
of
a
point.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no
we
do
not.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
certainly.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
and
this
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
am
going
to
right
now.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
what
we
asked
and
our
postulate
is
as
we
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
particularly
that
very
last
sentence
a
being
the
second
paragraph,
paragraph
number
2
at
the
very
end
of
the
opinion,
what
we
asked
this
court
to
do
is
this,
we
asked
this
court
to
reverse,
of
course
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
and
on
remand
we
ask
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed
and
we
say
this
for
several
reason.
these
state
law
points
were
fully
briefed
fully,
argued
before
the
district
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
our
position
is
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overturn
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
the
state
law
question.
now
this
position
we
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
not
in
deep
trouble
no.
if
it
had
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
we
would
have
to,
we
would
have
no
other
choice.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
--
we
do
not
ask
you
and
that
is
why.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
this
is
why
we
do
not
ask
this
mr.
justice
brennan
because
we
don’t
think
it’s
necessary.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
didn’t
overturn
it
and
we
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
that
this
court
should
do
that
because
the
points
were
fully
briefed
and
fully
argued
below
and
i
call
that
court’s
attention
again
to
the
point
where
they
--
one
of
the
–-
if
i
may
say
so
one
of
the
few
perfectly
explicit
things
the
court
did
say
was
that’s
its
difference
with
the
district
court
relates
to
the
federal
statute
and
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i’m
trying.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
right.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
would
like
to
say
as
the
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
--
on
that
score
i
think
that
we
come
right
back
to
the
charter
required
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
part
of
the
reorganization
in
which
the
protective
clause
is
found.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
think
the
charter
is
a
matter
of
state
law
of
missouri
state
law
surely.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no,
i
am
glad
that
you
have
i
am
not
sure
that
my
time
is
up,
but
what
we
are
really
focusing
on
mr.
justice
stewart
is
the
integrity
of
this
protective
provision
which
was
inserted
in
the
charter
and
we
ask
that
it
be
given
effect
and
we
further
say
that
by
only
by
giving
511
and
the
charter
and
the
state
law
the
most
restrictive
interpretation
can,
our
position
we
think
would
be
defeated,
and
we
ask
that
if
we
give
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
certainly.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan
and
on
that
point
i
should
say
that
the
congress
simply
used
the
word
law.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan
and
i
hope
to
state
again
my
reasons
in
support
of
that
position,
but
that
is
our
position,
we
didn’t
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
overturned
the
decision
of
the
district
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
i’ll
come
to
it
at
once
is
whether
these
shareholders
in
missouri
pacific
railroad
mopac
as
it
is
generally
called,
there
are
39,000
outstanding
shares
and
petitioners
here
represent
a
majority
of
them.
whether
these
petitioners
have
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
don’t
mr.
justice
white.
we
really
don’t
have
those
records,
the
railroad
would
have
those
records,
we
hold
a
majority.
the
question
is
whether
we
have
the
right
to
vote
separately
as
a
b
class
on
a
proposed
consolidation
proposed
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
railroad
and
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
whether
we
have
this
right
to
vote
separately
under
section
5
and
the
parenthetical
clause
of
paragraph
11
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
a
shareholders
numbered
1,800,000
in
each
of
these
shares
has
one
vote.
we’re
constantly
told
by
the
respondents
and
i
want
to
make
this
clear
at
the
outset
that
we
have
sort
of
a
tiny
minuscule
interest
because
we
have
only
2%
of
the
number
of
the
votes,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
our
participating
interest
in
the
company
even
three
years
ago
exceeded
that
of
the
a
shareholders.
today,
we
have
an
interest
of
some
$260
million
compared
to
the
interest,
fixed
interest
of
the
a
group
of
a
$180
million.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
precisely.
and
that
brings
me
at
once
really
mr.
justice
white
what
is
this
a
&
b
business,
what
are
these
a
and
b
shares,
how
do
they
come
about?
and
they
came
about
as
a
result
of
the
final
plan
and
reorganization
of
mopac
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
back
in
1954
and
this
plan
was
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
was
approved
and
confirmed
by
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
now
it
is
this
plan
that
created
these
two
groups
of
stock,
the
a
shares,
the
1,800,000
of
them
were
provided
for
in
the
plan
to
compensate
fully,
the
former
preferred
shareholders
not
only
for
the
par
of
their
preferred
stock,
but
also
for
unpaid
cumulative
dividend,
they’d
pay
it
in
full
and
their
dividend
under
the
a
shares
is
a
$5
maximum
and
their
interest
is
$100.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
and
by
the,
and
confirmed
by
the
reorganization
court.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
is
correct.
each
of
these
shares
is
entitled
to
one
vote,
each
of
the
1,800,000
shares
and
a
maximum
dividend
of
$5.
and
these
a
shares
have
the
characteristics,
we
submit
of
a
preferred
stock.
now
the
b
shares
were
issued
to
the
old
common
stockholders
and
these
b
shares
have
the
characteristics
of
a
common
shareholder.
the
situation
that
developed
under
this
plan
was
that
with
the
a
group
holding
98%
of
the
number
of
shares
than
the
b
group,
they
may
have
2%.
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
the
a,
--
the
b
group
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
a
group
and
here
comes
the
protective
clause
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
directed,
they
included
in
the
charter
of
mopac
and
this
was
part
of
the
reorganization
plan
and
it
was
inserted
at
the
direction
of
commission.
and
the
essence
of
this
protective
clause
is
that
the
company
shall
not
do
certain
things
without
a
majority
vote
of
each
class
of
stock
to
protective
clause
and
the
point
that
we
passing
on
is
that
the
company
shall
not
offer
or
change
the
preferences
and
the
special
or
relative
rights
of
the
a
or
the
b.
now
this
is
where
our
claim
for
a
separate
vote
begins
in
the
charter,
in
this
protective
clause.
now
the
respondents
say
that
this
generally
voted
clause
doesn’t
apply
to
us
because
this
is
a
consolidation
and
the
clause
doesn’t
use
the
word
consolidation.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
icc
required
that
this
protective
clause
be
included.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no,
no,
no,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
it’s
pending
there,
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
now
our
first
question
of
course
is,
does
this
propose
a
plan,
and
let
me
put
the
plan
in
a
capsule,
this
is
no
penn
central,
this
is
a
plan
under
which
mopac
proposes
to
consolidate
its
properties,
and
the
properties
of
a
83%
owned
subsidiary
texas
pacific
and
create
a
new
corporation
which
these
properties
would
be
transferred,
a
new
delaware
corporation
and
that’s
all
it
is.
and
in
a
moment,
i
want
to
show
now
how
this
plan,
there’s
a
little
more
to
it
than
that
that
does
affect
an
alteration
or
change
in
our
relevant
right.
what
the
plan
does
is
to
issue
new
shares
of
the
new
corporation
to
the
old
shareholder,
the
a
and
b
as
though
their
interest
were
identical.
i
suggested
the
a
is
a
really
preferred
stock
and
b
is
a
common
stock
and
they
treat
us
as
though
we
were
one,
we
are
not,
as
i
indicated
already.
and
this
is
where
the
alteration
or
change
takes
place.
the
district
court
thought
this
was
so
obvious
it
wasn’t
worth
talking
about;
i
wanted
to
speak
it
to
this
court
so
that
the
full
impact
of
this
plan
would
be
apparent
and
perfectly
clear.
now,
this
is
the
issue
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
right.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
exactly.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
it’s
four
to
one,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
is
correct,
exactly,
$25
for
common
stock.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
correct.
now,
this
issue
comes
before
this
court,
now
i’d
like
to
say
it
very
briefly
in
this
way,
and
at
this
time
because
mopac
submitted
its
plan
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
this
plan
and
in
december
of
1963
before
filing
it,
it
held
a
meeting
of
its
board
and
authorized
a
plan
and
all
of
that
and
in
january
of
1964
it
filed
a
plan
with
the
commission.
and
in
that
filing,
it
announced
that
this
would
be
submitted
to
the
shareholders
of
mopac
that
the
forthcoming
annual
meeting
in
may
of
1964
or
at
a
special
meeting
to
be
called
sooner,
at
which
the
plan
would
be
submitted
to
the
aggregate
vote
of
all
of
the
shareholders.
now
this
made
it
very
clear
to
us
that
the
requirement
of
a
separate
vote
of
these
shareholders
in
the
charter
which
i
shall
come
to
in
one
moment
was
being
disregarded,
that
we
would
better
get
busy
and
go
to
court
and
find
out
what
our
rights
were
and
we
did.
this
announcement
by
mopac
precipitated
the
action
of
which
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
is
based
on
diversity
of
the
citizenship
and
we
filed
our
action
in
the
district
court
of
missouri.
these
complaints
adequately
stated
the
facts
apparently
because
they
were
met
with
motions
to
dismiss
so
the
cases
hereon
motions
to
dismiss
the
complaints,
the
district
court
denied
these
motions,
upheld
our
position
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
i
like
to
state
now
what
it
is
about
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
that
we
believe
requires
reversal
and
the
important
policy
considerations
that
were
ignored
we
think
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
our
claim
is
parallel
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
treatment
of
section
511
and
really
only
the
parenthetical
clause
of
section
511
which
gives
effect
to
applicable
state
law
to
determine
the
vote
that
is
required,
the
assent
of
the
shareholders
as
its
put
to
accomplish
a
consolidation
really
any
consolidation.
this
court
has
had
occasion
often
to
refer
to
the
federal
policy
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
facilitate
consolidation
emergence
in
the
national
transportation
system,
but
this
court
has
also
adverted
to
the
further
requirement
of
section
511
that
there
be
assent
of
the
shareholder.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
the
assent
of
the
shareholders
and
if
that
vote
of
the
shareholders
in
favor
of
the
merger
or
consolidation
is
not
forthcoming,
there
will
be
no
such
consolidation
and
it
really
doesn’t
matter
whether
we
are
talking
about
penn
central
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
this
rather
limited
operation
of
mopac.
this
is
a
conventional
policy,
it
stands
with
the
same
dignity
we
submit
as
the
policy
to
facilitate
consolidation
and
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
national
transportation
policy
as
provided
by
the
congress
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
we
stand
on
it
and
submit
that
it
should
be
given
effect
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do.
now,
our
case
of
course
starts
with
this
charter
that
i’ve
talked
about
before.
we
think
this
charter
is
perfectly
straight
forward
in
giving
us
a
right
to
vote
separately
in
the
event
of
any
operation
or
change
of
our
relative
rights.
we
think
it
is.
we
think
the
missouri
statutes
which
give
effect
to
that
charter
requirement
are
straightforward
and
we
think
section
511
seems
to
us
to
be
a
simple
enough
requirement
that
applicable
state
law
shall
be
applied
here
and
this
is
the
error
we
claim,
we
claim
that
the
court
of
appeals
reached
its
decision
of
by
taking
the
first
policy
that
i
mentioned,
that
is
the
overall
policy
to
facilitate
consolidations
and
mergers
in
the
transportation
system
of
this
country,
took
that
policy
to
smother
the
--
we
think
equally
important
policy
of
giving
effect
to
applicable
state
law
to
determine
the
assent
of
shareholders.
this
part
of
our
policy.
this
is
not
a
compulsory
system
of
consolidation.
it
requires
the
assent
of
the
shareholders.
now
the
court
of
appeals
was
very
clear
in
saying
that
it
was
its
concept
of
the
federal
policy
that
moved
it
to
the
decision
it
reached
it
said
so
very
plainly
and
i
should
like
to
read
only
a
sentence
from
the
very
end
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
of
course,
we
think
the
district
court
decided
the
question
of
state
law
that
was
what
it
was
called
upon
to
do
what
is
the
applicable
state
law
here.
what
is
the
law
of
missouri
on
this
point?
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
this,
they
said
that
the
question
before
them
was
primarily
a
matter
of
the
interpretation
of
section
511,
rather
than
of
missouri
law,
and
they
said
that
our
difference
with
the
district
court
relates
to
this
statute,
section
511
and
the
national
transportation
policy
and
we
think
this
was
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
requires
reversal.
now,
i
want
to
come
now
to
what
are
we
asking
of
this
court.
if
i
were
you
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no,
we
would
not
mr.
justice
black,
because
they
did
not
give
effect
to
the
recognition
of
what
is
called
applicable
state
law
at
all.
they
were
so
impressed
if
you
like
with
the
importance
as
they
saw
it
of
the
national
--
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
we
thought
not
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
in
our
view
the
--
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
rated
it
differently,
but
i
should
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
point
where
they
seem
to
be
resolving
the
various
points,
the
court
of
appeals
speaks
at
length
of
this
consideration
and
that
consideration
and
so
on
and
i
would
think
that
on
the
record
of
page
157
mr.
justice
brennan
the
end
of
that
long
paragraph,
the
court
there
says
that
they
are
compelled
to
resolve
that
doubt
that
they
seem
to
be
expressing
on
the
side
of
those
provisions
of
the
statute
which
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
511,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
of
the
statute
which
speak
the
rule
and
that
is
the
majority
vote
now
i
have
not
mentioned
section
511
provides
for
a
majority
vote
unless
applicable
state
law
provides.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
maybe.
i
think
it’s
very
difficult
to
tell
just
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
doing
here
and
that’s
our
trouble
with
it.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
but
the
district
court
did
mr.
justice
white
and
we
don’t
find
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
overturned
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
the
state
law
because
the
court
of
appeals
went
off,
we
think
on
the
points
of
federal
law
which
we
believe
were
erroneous.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
that
would
have
been
obvious,
in
the
easy
case,
but
we
think
of
course
that
--
to
turn
to
the
state
law
point
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
we
just
don’t
read
it
that
way
because
and
i’d
like
to
refer
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
but
if
you
look
at
the
very
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
appears
on
page
158
of
the
record,
the
very
last
paragraph
number
two,
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
this
--
the
question
here
is
a
matter
which
primarily
concerns
the
interpretation
of
511
a
federal
statute.
and
despite
its
interplay
with
missouri
laws,
the
court
says
very
plainly
i
think
there
that
our
difference
with
the
district
court
relates
to
this
statute
that’s
511
and
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
i
think
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
i
think
this
mr.
justice
white,
the
district
court
didn’t
really
consider
the
federal
points
at
all,
it
applied
itself
to
the
state
law
point.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
as
the,
as
indeed
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
now
this
is
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
this
is
precisely
what
i
want
to
come
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no,
i
have
not
mr.
justice
black
because
i
think
section
5(11)
really
precludes
that,
i
think
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
oh,
i
think
that
would
if
the
statute
was
like
that,
there
is
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
would
answer
that
this
way
mr.
justice
black,
that
is
not
our
case
because
we
asking
here
for
a
right
to
vote.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
and
that
is
precisely
why
we’re
in
court.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
would
indeed
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
black.
with
this
additional
point,
i
think
and
that
is
that
we
find
here
a
federal
statue
that
does
in
section
5(11)
recognize
the
requirement
of
stockholder
assent.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
the
assent,
the
consent
or
the
vote
of
the
stockholders
and
this
vote
is
to
be
whatever
applicable
state
law
maybe
and
this
is
all
we
are
asking,
we
are
asking
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes.
it
is
--
it
appears
on
appendix
a
page
1(a)
of
our
main
brief.
the
relevant
provision
is
that
this
consolidation
and
so
forth
shall
not
take
place,
without
the
vote
of
a
majority.
now,
this
is
a
federal
rule
and
the
important
part
that
we
stress
is
unless
a
different
vote
is
required
under
applicable
state
law.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
those
are
the
words
of
section
5(11)
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
we
do
and
if
the
word
be
singular
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
we
object,
we’re
not
claiming
it’s
unconstitutional,
but
we’re
claiming
that
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
i
don’t
think
it
would
be.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
the
statue
5(11)
refers
to
the
number
so
required
and
i
think
mr.
justice
black
if
i
understood
you
correctly
you
were
concerned
less
the
a
shares
were
in
a
position
to
vote
the
entire
aggregate
vote
and
we
could
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well
that
is
--
we
think
that
the
construction
urged
by
the
respondents
here
bumps
right
into
that
kind
of
a
point.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no
we
do
not.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
certainly.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
and
this
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
am
going
to
right
now.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
what
we
asked
and
our
postulate
is
as
we
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
particularly
that
very
last
sentence
a
being
the
second
paragraph,
paragraph
number
2
at
the
very
end
of
the
opinion,
what
we
asked
this
court
to
do
is
this,
we
asked
this
court
to
reverse,
of
course
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
and
on
remand
we
ask
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed
and
we
say
this
for
several
reason.
these
state
law
points
were
fully
briefed
fully,
argued
before
the
district
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
our
position
is
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overturn
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
the
state
law
question.
now
this
position
we
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
not
in
deep
trouble
no.
if
it
had
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
we
would
have
to,
we
would
have
no
other
choice.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
--
we
do
not
ask
you
and
that
is
why.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
this
is
why
we
do
not
ask
this
mr.
justice
brennan
because
we
don’t
think
it’s
necessary.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
didn’t
overturn
it
and
we
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
that
this
court
should
do
that
because
the
points
were
fully
briefed
and
fully
argued
below
and
i
call
that
court’s
attention
again
to
the
point
where
they
--
one
of
the
–-
if
i
may
say
so
one
of
the
few
perfectly
explicit
things
the
court
did
say
was
that’s
its
difference
with
the
district
court
relates
to
the
federal
statute
and
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i’m
trying.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
right.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
would
like
to
say
as
the
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
--
on
that
score
i
think
that
we
come
right
back
to
the
charter
required
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
part
of
the
reorganization
in
which
the
protective
clause
is
found.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
think
the
charter
is
a
matter
of
state
law
of
missouri
state
law
surely.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no,
i
am
glad
that
you
have
i
am
not
sure
that
my
time
is
up,
but
what
we
are
really
focusing
on
mr.
justice
stewart
is
the
integrity
of
this
protective
provision
which
was
inserted
in
the
charter
and
we
ask
that
it
be
given
effect
and
we
further
say
that
by
only
by
giving
511
and
the
charter
and
the
state
law
the
most
restrictive
interpretation
can,
our
position
we
think
would
be
defeated,
and
we
ask
that
if
we
give
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
certainly.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan
and
on
that
point
i
should
say
that
the
congress
simply
used
the
word
law.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan
and
i
hope
to
state
again
my
reasons
in
support
of
that
position,
but
that
is
our
position,
we
didn’t
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
overturned
the
decision
of
the
district
--
