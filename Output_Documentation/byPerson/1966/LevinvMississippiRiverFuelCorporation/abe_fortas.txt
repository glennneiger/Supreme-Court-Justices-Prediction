going

justice

is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
511
mr.
lyons
that
would
shed
any
lights
on
your
interpretation
of
that
act
as
far
as
this
is
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
set
forth
here
in
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
the
deal
goes
as
far
as
mr.
lyons
in
making
a
distinction
between
what
is
required
under
state
law
by
state
law
and
what
is
applicable,
required
under
applicable
state
law,
remember
he
had
a
little
--
justice
abe
fortas
he
had
a
little
hypothetical
which
i
chose
to
amend
a
bit,
if
a
man
hiring
someone
to
pay
defense
in
court
and
the
man
didn’t
pay
the
defense
or
compensation,
is
he
entitled
to
compensation
under
state
law
or
does
that
work.
mr.
lyons
fails
to
understand
that
he
did
not,
but
the
outcome
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
legislated
history?
justice
abe
fortas
if
you’re
going
to
give
a
different
wording
to
these
words
under
state
law;
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
have
some
legislative
history
or
something
to
indicate
that
we
should
change
the
normal
effect
of
those
words.
