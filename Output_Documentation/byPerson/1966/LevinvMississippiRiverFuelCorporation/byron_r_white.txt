justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
how
many
shareholders
there
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
by
that
if
the
company
were
liquidated
you’d
have
distributed
rights
of
that
much
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
this
question,
what
significance
do
you
attach
to
the
sentences
just
above
this
mr.
mcallister,
while
there
are
significant
contrary
arguments,
we
are
not
persuaded
either
a
that
mopac’s
articles
”
requires
full
consolidation”
or
b
and
if
they
do
section
35127
by
its
reference
to
the
article
demands
the
class
vote
or
that
even
if
it
does
class
voting
is
required
for
state
law,
particularly
b
is
that,
does
that
indicate
some
disagreement
of
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
the
court
of
appeals,
just
was
deciding
what
the
state
law
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
decided
the
way
it
did
that
the
state
law
had
said
in
case
of
the
consolidation
there
shall
be
a
separate
code
of
each
class
of
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
would
have
decided
that
way
and
that
it
would
have
recognized
the
state
law,
that
it
had
to
be
said
consolidation,
why
wouldn’t
it
do
so
here.
if
the
district
court
said
this
statute
is
--
it
is
just
as
though,
this
section
had
the
word
consolidation
in
it,
just
as
though.
now,
if
that
were
true
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
gone
along
with
it
you
say,
but
it
didn’t
go
along
with
it
so
it
must
have
decided
that
state
law
isn’t
what
the
district
court
said
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
just
the
result,
result
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
could
have
differed
with
them
on
that
and
they
could
also
differed
with
them
on
state
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
the
court
of
appeals
is
absolutely
wrong
on
511
and
it’s
impact
on
this
state
law
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
might
force
the
provision
of
511.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
had
it
been
in
deep
trouble.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
that
class
a
stock
go
to
some
creditors
and
former
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
had
a
fixed,
they
had
–-
class
a
went
to
class
of
stockholders
that
had
fixed
right
in
the
company
that
was
that
–-
i
mean,
a
fixed
distribution
rights
and
fixed
dividend
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
the
creditors
paid
off
100%?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
he
didn’t
say
100%
in
majority.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
who
had
the
burden,
you
have
the
burden
of
case
didn’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
the
articles
called
for
a
class
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
dead
against
you,
he
said
the
mopac
articles,
we
are
not
persuading
that
the
mopac
articles
called
for
a
class
vote
on
consolidation.
they
say
that
class
b
stockholders
must
surmount
this
problem
and
they
have
not.
now
what
do
you
do
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
same
provision
have
been
governing
here
in
your
view
on
a
recapitalization?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
--
on
the
missouri
law
point
if
this
can
happen
in
railroad
reorganization,
it
could
happen
under
missouri
law
in
just
an
ordinary
recapitalization.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
what
missouri
law
is
and
they’re
right.
this
same
thing
could
happen
and
this
--
it
could
happen
in
this
company
on
a
recapitalization.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
merger
is
turned
was
down
by
the
commerce
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
under
missouri
law
this
could
happen
on
just
a
recap.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
certainly
stop
it
in
its
track?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
particular
commission
or
but
the
statute
5(11)
does
say
that
the
commission
has
defined
a
majority
of
approved
merger,
so
stockholders
can
kill
any
merger.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
your
case
doesn’t
depend
on
this,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
lose
on
this
issue
of
the
required
and
then
still
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
basic
federal
law
question
seems
to
be
as
if
just
unreasonable
for
a
fair
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
i
have
missed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
maybe
i’ve
misread
this.
if
i
understand
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
notorious
pieces
of
predatory
finesse
i’ve
seen,
and
i’ve
seen
quite
a
few,
is
the
appropriation
of
this
tremendous
asset
value
of
one
--
by
one
block
stock
to
another
block
stock.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
you
--
how
could
we
possibly
conceive
of
that
as
a
fair
and
just
and
reasonable?
but
those
--
maybe
i
have
misread
it,
but
that’s
the
way
i’m
--
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
mr.
lyons
would
the
i.c.c.
under
5(2)
application
have
to
decide
first,
at
the
outset
of
a
proceeding
whether
this
provision
5(11)
had
been
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
that
--
no
one
has
raised
the
question
of
primary
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
lyons,
what
if
the
motion
--
what
if
the
injunction
suit
by
these
plaintiffs
had
attacked
the
plan
as
not
being
just
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
what
if
they
had
and
some
court,
some
state
court
reported
to
decide
that
it
was
just
unreasonable
over
some
objection,
that
this
was
a
matter
of
primary
jurisdiction
for
the
commission
under
511.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
along
with
the
finding
of
just
unreasonable
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
commission
also
has
defined
along
with
the
just
unreasonable
finding
that
a
plan
has
been
approved
by
the
requisite
number
of
shareholders.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
the
authority
conferred
shall
be
exclusive
and
plenary
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
full
power
with
the
assent
and
so
forth.
do
you
suppose
it’s
too
late
for
us
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
no
more
than
we
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
but
this
is
the
question,
the
first
thing
you’ve
argued
is
a
matter
of
federal
law,
what
was
required
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
just
by
assuming,
they
ruled
definitely.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
just
said
they
just
got
to
be
assuming.
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
that
is
kind
--
that
is
what
congress
was
doing,
i’m
asking,
we’re
talking
about
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
why
did
they
later
say
they
had
done
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact
they
ruled
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
on
page
8
of
our
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
said
they
were
also
to
make,
they
were
driven
the
word
required
and
didn’t
they
rule
on
what
they
thought
requires
man
under
5(11)?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
ruled
on
it,
and
ruled
on
it
because
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
not
the
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it’s
required
means
something
mandatory
not
something
permitted
by
agreements.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
while
you
put
the
two
together
that
means
that
at
most
this
does
it,
that
certainly
under
missouri
law
it’s
permissive
to
do
it
this
way,
but
the
federal
statute
uses
the
word
required
and
that
required
implies
something
mandatory,
not
something
permissive
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn’t
that
out
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn’t
you
wait
for
the
commission
to
decide
this
instead
of
coming
into
court
with
a
separate
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
just
within
its
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
some
cases
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that’s
all
right,
it’s
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lowenthal,
at
the
time
that
charter
provision
came
in
upon
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
law
of
missouri
was
to
the
effect
that
a
majority
of
vote
only
is
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
from
the
other
side
that
this
provision
was
in
the
missouri
law
of
1961.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
in
railroad
reorganizations?
justice
byron
r.
white
up
until
1961,
the
applicable
statutes
for
the
railroad
consolidation
–
is
that
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
how
many
shareholders
there
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
by
that
if
the
company
were
liquidated
you’d
have
distributed

does
that
indicate

the
district
court?
justice
byron

maybe
the
court
of
appeals,
just
was
deciding
what
the
state
law
was.
justice
byron

i
don’t

and
what
about

what
about

he
didn’t

100%
in

justice

you’ve
argued
is
a
matter
of
federal
law,
what
was
required
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
just
by
assuming,
they
ruled
definitely.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
just
said
they
just
got
to
be
assuming.
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
that
is
kind
--
that
is
what
congress
was
doing,
i’m
asking,
we’re
talking
about
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
why
did
they
later
say
they
had
done
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact
they
ruled
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
on
page
8
of
our
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
said
they
were
also
to
make,
they
were
driven
the
word
required
and
didn’t
they
rule
on
what
they
thought
requires
man
under
5(11)?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
ruled
on
it,
and
ruled
on
it
because
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
not
the
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it’s
required
means
something
mandatory
not
something
permitted
by
agreements.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
while
you
put
the
two
together
that
means
that
at
most
this
does
it,
that
certainly
under
missouri
law
it’s
permissive
to
do
it
this
way,
but
the
federal
statute
uses
the
word
required
and
that
required
implies
something
mandatory,
not
something
permissive
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn’t
that
out
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn’t
you
wait
for
the
commission
to
decide
this
instead
of
coming
into
court
with
a
separate
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
just
within
its
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
some
cases
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that’s
all
right,
it’s
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lowenthal,
at
the
time
that
charter
provision
came
in
upon
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
law
of
missouri
was
to
the
effect
that
a
majority
of
vote
only
is
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
from
the
other
side
that
this
provision
was
in
the
missouri
law
of
1961.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
in
railroad
reorganizations?
justice
byron
r.
white
up
until
1961,
the
applicable
statutes
for
the
railroad
consolidation
–
is
that
where?
