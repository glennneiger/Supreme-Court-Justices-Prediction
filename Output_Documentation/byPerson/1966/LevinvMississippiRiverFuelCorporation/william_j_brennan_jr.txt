justice

j.
brennan,

you
said
they
gave
no,
if
i
understood
you,
gave
no
effect
of
the
court
applicable
to
state
law,
i
rather
read
that
opinion
as
differing
with
the
district
judge
as
to
what
applicable,
as
to
what
the
missouri
law,
am
i
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
have
i
thought
the
opinion
reflects
some
difficulty
in
determining
precisely
what
the
state
law
was
that
i
rather
than
indicating
that
whatever
it
was
--
certainly
it
was
what
the
district
court
had
said
with
missouri
law,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meaning
this
was
511.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
mr.
justice
white
said,
mr.
mcallister,
suppose
we
do
propose
that
in
what
you
referred
to
in
the
concluding
paragraph
158,
the
court
of
appeals
was
just
dead
wrong
and
then
it
becomes
question
what
is
the
missouri
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
we
to
do
in
that
circumstance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
then
you
would
just
ask
us
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
state
law
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
when
we’ve
done
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
have
to
reach
--
if
i
have
to
disagree
with
you
and
saying
that
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
did
disagree
with
the
district
court
on
what
missouri
law
was
and
then
i
really
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don’t
see
that
we
up
here,
i
can’t
recall,
that
was
second
guess,
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
differed
with
the
district
court
on
what
state
law
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
didn’t
overturn
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
can
go
ahead
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
go
ahead
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
the
difficult
with
that
i
suggest
is
that
section
511
did
not
differ
at
all
the
state
law
in
the
area
in
which
the
schwabacher
case
dealt,
but
section
511
does
differ
to
state
law
in
connection
with
voting.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
even
before
61.
