would
you
raise
a
provisions
of
5(11)
and
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
those
are
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
the
provision
of
511,
that
you
read,
means
state
law
as
found
in
statutes
of
the
state
or
whether
a
body
of
state
law
in
the
sense
that
if
state
law
requires
–
that
the
charter
provision
be
given
effect,
that
is
embraced
within
the
composite
of
511,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
am
not
arguing
i
am
just
trying
to
sort
out
the
issue
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know
if
we
decide
that
in
your
favor,
what
you’re
saying
is
well
the
district
court
held
the
missouri
law
was
that
you
claim
it
to
be.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
although
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
decide
it,
we
should
bypass
the
court
of
appeals
and
either
accept
the
district
court’s
view
what
missouri
law
was
or
--
which
i
suppose
amounts
to
the
same
thing
to
review
it
without
passing
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
state
law
unconstitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
should
think
so,
because
this
court
has
often
said
that
it
favors
a
construction
of
the
law
on
the
side
that
avoids
a
constitutional
question,
thank
you.
