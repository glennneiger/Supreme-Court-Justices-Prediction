mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
federal
law
questions
in
the
case.
questions
having
to
do
with
the
interpretation
of
the
section
5(11)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
also
having
to
do
with
the
interpretation
of
section
5(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
was
not
mentioned
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
mcroberts
will
address
himself
to
the
questions
relating
to
the
interpretation
of
the
articles
of
association
of
mopac
and
to
the
other
state
law
questions
and
generally
where
they
fit
in
to
this
litigation.
during
the
course
of
my
segment
of
the
oral
argument,
i
will
make
certain
assumptions
in
the
petitioner’s
favor,
certain
assumptions
that
they
approved
for
the
sake
of
argument,
certain
things.
first,
that
the
articles
do
apply
to
a
consolidation,
second
that
section
--
that
chapter
351
of
the
missouri
statutes
is
the
applicable
state
law
and
second
--
thirdly,
the
provision
that
they
have
to
rely
on
the
enabling
act
provision
351.270
that,
that
would
enforce
here
the
vote
that
we
are
assuming
the
charter
provides
for.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
take
issue
of
all
three
of
those
proposition
your
honor
and
we
say
that
the
--
of
course,
the
petitioners
have
to
prove
all
three
of
those;
they
have
to
prove
the
two
federal
law
propositions.
we
also
say
that
on
two
of
the
three
state
law
propositions
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
had
not
made
out
their
case.
now
the
result
of
accepting
the
petitioners
claim
here
i’d
like
to
talk
about
that
just
briefly
because
i
don’t
think
it’s
been
fully
stated.
the
petitioners
have
suggested
to
you
that
the
terms
of
the
plan
of
consolidation
have
something
to
do
with
whether
their
position
leads
them
to
a
class
vote
on
a
consolidation.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
their
position
is
correct
and
what
they
assert,
they
would
have
a
class
vote
on
every
merger
or
consolidation
to
which
mopac
might
be
a
party.
this
is
because
there
is
a
provision
in
this
very
same
section
of
the
articles,
if
they
rely
on
and
if
these
articles
apply
to
a
consolidation
with
respect
to
sub-items
b
and
c
and
d,
c
and
d
as
they
suggest
there
is
no
reason
why
sub-item
a
doesn’t
apply
and
that
says
that
there
is
a
class
vote,
we
say
not
applicable
to
consolidation,
they
say
applicable
to
a
consolidation.
if
the
company
shall
issue
any
shares
of
stock
of
the
company
of
any
class
now
or
hereafter
authorized
in
addition
to
the
shares
authorized
at
the
time
of
the
reorganization.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
any
increase
in
the
capital
stock
of
mopac,
on
a
consolidation
and
it’s
impossible
to
think
of
a
consolidation
except
with
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
where
that
wouldn’t
be
the
case.
then,
if
that’s
true,
if
their
position
is
true,
they
have
a
class
vote
on
every
merger
or
consolidation
to
which
mopac
would
be
a
party.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
we
suggest
that
when
the
proposition
is
seen
in
that
extent,
the
inconsistency
of
section
5(11)
with
that
proposition
becomes
more
manifest.
the
fact
of
the
matter
here
is
that
the
stockholder
vote
does
not
approve
or
finally
approve
any
of
these
mergers.
the
stockholder
vote
and
i
think
this
is
particularly
relevant
to
mr.
justice
black’s
question.
the
stockholder
vote
is
just
a
ticket
of
admission
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
if
you
require
a
class
vote
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
can
and
the
question
is
what
vote
did
congress
provides
for
the
stockholders
as
a
ticket
of
admission
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
if
this
plan
of
consolidation
is
all
the
things,
that
the
petitioners
say
it
is
and
incidentally
we
dispute
them,
but
they
are
not
we
submit
in
this
case.
if
it’s
all
that
the
petitioners
say
it
is,
presumably
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
not
find
under
section
5(2)
that
the
terms
of
the
consolidation
where
just
and
reasonable
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
consolidation.
the
purpose
then
of
the
narrow
issue
of
law,
federal
law
and
the
state
law
that
we’re
discussing
today
is
whether
this
plan
will
even
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
its
review
of
the
public
interest
factors,
and
for
its
review
of
whether
the
terms
both
as
between
the
different
classes
of
stockholders
and
with
respect
to
the
public
stockholders
of
texas
and
pacific,
those
terms
are
just
unreasonable.
now,
we’ve
heard
considerable
amount
of
discussion
as
to
the
terms
of
the
class
voting
here
being
required
by
the
i.c.c.
or
imposed
into
the
articles
of
the
i.c.c.
systems.
mr.
mcroberts
will
address
himself
to
that,
he
was
there
at
that
time
and
we
believe,
he
will
show
that
is
not
the
case.
however,
even
if
it
were
the
case,
it’s
a
little
hard
to
imagine
why
the
i.c.c.
would
have
been
intended
this
class
voting
provision
to
apply
to
consolidations
when
rail
consolidation
are
subject
to
the
most
plenary
of
i.c.c.
jurisdiction.
i.c.c.
jurisdiction
to
examine
the
terms
of
the
fairness
of
the
plan
and
then
of
course
judicial
review
of
the
i.c.c.’s
order
after
the
i.c.c.’s
order
is
made.
the
first
thing
that
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
in
construing
section
511
is
its
language
and
the
critical
word
we
submit
is
the
word
that
counsel
kept
leaving
out
until
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
him
to
read
the
statute
and
that
is
the
word
required.
congress
provided
in
section
511
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
submit
a
merger
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
its
scrutiny,
if
the
merger
or
consolidation
was
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
votes
of
the
holders
of
the
shares
entitled
to
vote
of
the
capital
stock
of
the
carrier.
unless,
and
this
is
the
only
unless
clause.
unless
a
different
vote
is
required
under
applicable
state
law
in
which
case
the
numbers
so
required
shall
assent
of
the
votes
of
the
holders
of
the
shares
entitled
to
vote.
now,
we
start
with
the
general
proposition
that
congress
in
passing
the
1940
transportation
act,
which
is
where
this
language
came
into
the
statute,
the
prior
version
of
the
statute
clearly
differed
to
state
charters,
to
state
law
and
state
charters
and
to
any
provision
that
would
be
enforceable
under
any
authority
against
the
carrier.
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
facilitate
consolidations
and
mergers
in
the
rail
industry.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that.
we
submit
that
in
order
to
fulfill
that
interpretation,
the
more
literal
meaning
of
the
statute
would
coincide
with
the
federal
policy.
the
least
complicated
the
vote
is,
the
simpler
it
is
the
more
in
the
direction
of
a
simple
majority
vote
and
only
a
narrow
exception
from
that.
the
more
the
federal
policy
would
be
fulfilled
of
getting
these
mergers
to
the
commerce
commission
where
the
commissioner
could
take
a
look
at
them.
now,
it’s
a
strange
use
of
language
we
submit
to
say
that
missouri
law
requires
even
if
we
assume
that
the
articles
in
missouri
law
are
what
the
petitioners
say
they
are,
that
it
requires
a
class
vote
here.
if
i
make
a
contract
with
a
man
to
paint
my
fence,
it’s
a
strange
way
of
saying
that
virginia
law
requires
him
to
paint
my
fence
and
i
think
a
more
normal
way
of
putting
that
would
be
that
the
contract
required
him
to
paint
my
fence
and
that
virginia
law
presumably
would
give
effect
to
that
contract.
that
is
the
literal
we
submit
meaning
of
this
federal
statute.
the
interpretation
of
the
petitioners
violates
not
only
the
underlying
policy
of
the
whole
statute,
but
the
usages
in
common
speech
and
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
say
the
contract
required
and
that
the
law
will
enforce
that
contract.
there
is
an
there
is
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well
it’s
a
distinction
we
submit
that
congress
made
in
the
statute
and
they
very
easily
could
have
left
the
old
language
of
the
statute
in.
it’s
a
distinction
we
submit
that
congress
made
and
there
are
good
reasons
for
it
in
terms
of
the
background,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
we’ll
come
to
in
a
moment.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
the
property
rights
of
the
stockholders
here
will
be
amply
protected
by
the
i.c.c.
and
we
assume
by
the
district
court
when
it
reviews
the
i.c.c.’s
order
and
by
this
court
should
an
appeal
be
taken
from
the
district
court’s
order.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
submit
that
the
federal
statute
here
overrides
the
contract
rights,
assuming
that
they
have
a
contract
right,
just
as
in
the
schwabacher
case
under
state
law
therein,
actually
this
was
a
requirement
of
state
law,
there
were
dissenter’s
appraisal
rights,
the
stockholders
who
didn’t
like
the
merger
there
or
if
state
law
were
governing,
were
entitled
to
be
paid
off
in
cash
and
this
court
said
that
maybe
the
case
under
state
law,
but
section
511
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
it
certainly
does
differ
as
to
the
requirements
of
state
law
and
it
uses
that
word
required
twice
--
required
under
a
state
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
from
required
by
there
maybe,
your
honor
there
maybe
some
slight
difference,
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
think
it
material.
i
think
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
congress
to
have
made
the
distinction
between
that
which
was
required
by
state
law
that
--
and
on
that
which
was
required
by
corporate
charters.
actually
in
order
to
do
that
they
could
have
left
the
law
alone.
could
have
left
it
the
way
it
was
under
the
1920
statute.
in
essence
what
the
petitioners
are
saying
here
is
that
this
very
distinct
change
of
language
from
section
56(c)
later
section
54
of
the
1920
act
means
nothing
at
all,
that
you
have
a
plenary
reference
into
the
articles
wherever
the
articles
are
not
denied
in
enforcement
by
state
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
actually
my
case
doesn’t
depend
--
the
petitioner’s
case
depends
on
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
because
we
have
the
three
state
law
points,
actually
there’s
a
second
federal
law
point
that
i’ll
come
to
shortly.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes
your
honor
that
is
the
basic
federal
law
point,
and
that
is
the
point.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
which
we
haven’t
come
to
yet.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
that’s
what
the
complaint
says
certainly,
your
honor,
we’re
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now
let
me
say
that
the
--
most
of
the
methods
of
valuation
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
petitioners
here
would
insist
on
we
find
totally
irrelevant
in
the
context.
they
are
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well
that
is
correct
your
honor,
let’s
assume
that
this
was
a
monstrous
fraud
as
the
complaints
say.
let’s
assume
then
that
we
made
a
deal
with
alleghany
to
go
along
with
it
for
some
backhanded
consideration
and
there
is
an
approving
class
vote,
you
go
to
the
commission
and
assume
the
commission
starts
the
hearings,
then
you
have
that
issue.
you
have
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
plan
is
just
and
reasonable
and
that
the
parties
could
put
evidence
on
it
at
that
time.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
this
plan
will
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
if
the
court
recalls
that
in
effect
this
class
of
stock
has
a
veto,
any
provision
in
any
articles
of
incorporation,
let’s
say
that
a
particular
class
is
to
have
a
class
vote
on
consolidations.
any
such
provision
will
have
to
be
honored
under
section
511
and
those
consolidations
involving
those
railroads
would
never
even
be
started
without
the
approval
not
only
of
the
general
vote
of
the
stockholders
and
of
the
board
of
directors,
but
of
each
class
that
in
the
corporate
charter
had
back
prior
before
the
1940
act
perhaps
obtained
such
a
concession.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
the
i.c.c.
has
taken
no
view
on
this.
the
application
has
not
been
pressed
by
the
petitioners,
by
the
respondents
as
long
as
this
case
has
been
going--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
if
we
get
back
to
the
position
then
that
the
charter
provisions
don’t
talk
about
consolidation
at
all,
and
it
would
be
rather
odd
to
say
that
the
commission
--
one
of
the
aids
to
interpretation
that
they
don’t
apply
the
consolidations
is
that
there’d
be
no
purpose
for
the
commission
to
protect
the
parties
against
the
commission,
since
the
commissions
review
of
the
terms
of
the
consolidation
as
plenary.
it’s
unlike
some
of
the
other
things
that
are
provided
for
in
the
articles
where
either
the
commission
has
no
reviewing
power
at
all
or
where
it’s
reviewing
power
is
limited
to
issues
like
stock
watering
matters
of
that,
sort
of
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
i.c.c.
has
taken
no
action
whatsoever
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it’s
issued
no
order
at
all.
the
application
has
been
filed.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
i.c.c.
is
--
the
only
action
that
has
been
taken
i
believe
by
the
i.c.c’s
file
room
is
let
us
file
the
application
and
there
have
been
no
proceedings
on
the
application.
this
suit
was
brought
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
the
private
parties
here
brought
a
bill
for
injunction
in
the
district
court
before
a
single
district
judge
involving
the
diversities
of
jurisdiction.
and
the
only
question
tended
to
this
court
on
that
bill
is
not
the
justice
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
plan
which
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well
the
i.c.c.
in
terms
of
the
vote
that
would
generally
apply
for
election
of
directors
say,
the
i.c.c.
insisted
that
the
election
of
directors
and
the
general
corporate
matters,
the
general
voting
power
be
the
way
that
it
is.
they
--
the
class
b
stock
then
said
we
should
have
twice
as
many
shares
as
you’re
proposing
to
give
us
and
that
would
give
us
4%
of
the
vote.
wouldn’t
it
be
fair
to
give
us
4%
of
the
vote
and
i.c.c.
said
absolutely
not.
they
have
only
a
minuscule
interest
in
this
corporation;
they’re
being
treated
generously
enough
by
being
given
2%
of
the
vote.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
suppose
they
would
your
honor,
that’s
a
condition
pursuant
to
the
exercise
of
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no
one
ever
has,
we
have
not.
the
petitioners
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don’t
believe
--
sorry
your
honor
i
maybe
mistaken
but
no
party
has
seriously
pressed
this
and
actually
what
we
have
here
is
a
naked
question
i
believe
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
oh
it
did
also,
but
those
issues
were
separate
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
that’s
perfectly
a
clear
case
of
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
would
have
to
be
reversed.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i’m
not
sure
that
the
statute
provides
that
as
one
of
their
findings,
the
statute
provides
that
that’s
one
of
things
that
has
to
take
place,
that
there
has
to
be
the
approval
of
the
commission
and
the
assents
of
the
stockholders.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
your
honor,
i
wouldn’t
attempt
to
suggest
what
you
might
do,
but
i
believe
that
this
does
not
partake
of
the
sort
of
the
questions
of
the
court
has
generally
held
to
be
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
rationale,
it’s
a
pure
question
of
--
for
the
three
points,
the
interpretation
of
state
law
and
what
the
i.c.c.
would
know
about
that
as
problematical.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
and
the
--
quite
right.
and
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it’s
only
when
you
pass
through
the
state
law
questions
that
you
come
to
the
federal
law
questions.
so
if
the
i.c.c.
was
to
attempt
to
determine
this,
it
could
not
even
reach
the
federal
law
questions,
but
we
contend
that
the
federal
law
questions
here
are
pure
issues
of
law
and
that
they
could
be
decided
by
the
federal
courts
and
an
action
of
bill
and
equity,
unlike
as
your
honor
quite
rightly
points
out
the
question
of
justice
and
reasonableness
which
is
reserved
for
another
day.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
there
is
your
honor,
we
set
it
forth
an
extensive
in
our
briefs.
one
of
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
i
will
your
honor.
the
basic
problems
with
the
1920
transportation
act,
which
clearly
said
what
the
petitioners
say
the
1940
act
says.
one
of
the
basic
problems
of
course
was
that
it
had
this
requirement
of
a
master
plan.
the
other
problem
that
was
found
and
the
commentators
speak
to
this,
is
the
fact
that
minority
groups
were
able
to
tie
up
consolidations
and
mergers
and
prevent
them
from
proceeding
and
all
during
the
20s
and
30s
there
were
bills
introduced
in
effect
to
do
away
with
the
old
provision
of
section
56(c)
which
made
this
deference
to
the
corporate
charters
and
to
provide
a
federal
voting
standard.
some
of
the
bills
provided
a
majority
general
vote,
some
of
them
provided
a
two-thirds
general
vote.
the
comment
was
made
of
all
these
bills
were
being
considered
under
the
1920
act,
that
maybe
a
majority
vote
was
too
low
and
a
lot
of
the
states
required
a
general
two-thirds
vote.
now
nothing
directly
and
immediately
came
out
of
these
bills.
the
interest
died
to
a
certain
extent
during
the
depression,
interest
died
in
rail
consolidations.
but
these
problems
were
very
much
there,
they
had
been
repeatedly
put
forward
by
the
railroad
trade
associations
that
the
deferring
to
state
law
that
was
the
old
practice
created
deferring
to
the
charters
and
the
state
law
that
was
the
previous
practice,
created
a
considerable
problem
and
permitted
what
one
commentator
called
troublesome
minorities
to
block
these
plans.
now,
we
submit
that
when
and
again
the
last
committee
reports,
when
we
come
to
the
1939,
when
this
bill
was
finally,
virtually
passed,
it’s
funny
enacted
the
next
year.
the
committee
reports
don’t
say
anything
one
way
or
the
other
on
this
point,
but
we
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
the
classical
theory
of
interpreting
a
statute
that
you
look
to
the
problem,
that
the
prior
law
presented
and
this
was
a
problem
that
was
generally
recognized,
that
the
preferable
interpretation
of
the
statute
against
the
light
of
that
problem
and
against
the
light
of
this
congressional
concern
is
that
it
made
a
minimal
reference
to
state
law
simply
to
the
affirmative
expressions
of
state
public
policy.
the
state
law
requirements,
the
most
typical
one
being
for
a
two-thirds
general
vote.
then
in
effect
this
provision
is
compromised
between
the
old
provisions
of
federal
bills
that
had
been
introduced
over
the
years,
some
of
which
provided
for
a
majority
vote,
some
of
which
provided
for
two-thirds
vote.
this
act
we
submit
says
that
the
general
rule
is
a
majority
vote
if
the
state
law
imposes
a
positive
requirement
for
more
that
will
be
accepted.
now,
our
second
point
on
the
federal
law
is
that
even
if
the
provisions
of
section
511
are
broad
enough
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that’s
the
high
spots
of
it
your
honor,
we
have
of
course
in
more
detail
in
our
brief,
one
of
the
important
things
i
think
further
is
that
there
were
very
few
provisions
of
the
sort
that
the
petitioners
are
now
relying
on
in
1940,
when
congress
thought
about
required
under
state
law,
it
was
thinking
about
the
affirmative
requirements
of
state
law
to
the
effect
that
you
have
to
have
two-thirds
or
three-fifths
vote
on
a
merger.
these
statutes
giving
effect
to
provisions
of
corporate
charters
were
not
general
then,
they
were
only
four
at
that
time.
they
did
not
really
begin
to
come
into
the
picture
in
great
number
until
the
model
business
corporation
act
was
promulgated
in
1950.
we
say
further
as
our
second
point
of
federal
law
that
even
if
the
statute
is
read
as
giving
effect
to,
well
i
call
it
voluntary
or
permissible
vote
under
state
law;
it
would
never
give
effect
to
a
class
vote.
first,
we
refer
again
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
talks
about
votes
required
under
state
law
varying
the
federal
standard,
but
the
only
way
in
which
the
federal
standard,
which
is
for
a
majority
general
vote
can
be
varied
is
with
respect
to
the
number
of
the
votes
of
the
holders
of
the
shares
entitled
to
vote
of
the
capital
stock
of
such
corporation.
we
say
that
on
its
face
this
means
that
you
can
vary
the
number,
you
can
say
and
so
the
majority
of
that
shall
be
two-thirds
or
three-fourths
or
three-fifths
that
says
nothing
at
all
about
class
voting
or
about
giving
any
effect
to
state
laws
that
permit
the
vote
to
be
taken
other
than
on
a
general
basis.
now,
there
were
in
the
late
30s
bills
before
congress,
which
would
have
done
just
that.
i.c.c.
commissioner
eastman’s
bill
provided
for
a
class
vote
and
certainly
congress
at
that
time
was
what
commissioner
eastman
produced
a
very
respectful
hearing,
but
what
congress
came
out
with
did
not
provide
for
a
class
vote.
moreover,
there
are
other
provisions
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
there
were
some,
there
were
fewer
bills
in
the
late
30s,
but
eastman’s
bill
did
come
out
in
‘36
and
is
forth
report
as
coordinator
of
transportation.
now,
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
section
20b
is
the
example,
which
provide
for
a
class
vote.
these
provisions
show
that
when
congress
wanted
there
to
be
a
class
vote,
it
provided
so
in
terms.
we
submit
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
congress
did
not
provide
for
a
class
vote
here
was
the
fact
that
a
class
vote
in
the
ordinary
corporation
is
simply
a
guarantee
of
the
fairness
of
the
plan
that
it
affects
all
classes
of
the
stockholders
fairly.
here
we
have
an
administrative
control
over
the
fairness
of
the
fund.
so
we
submit
that
on
both
these
grounds
of
federal
law,
one
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
went
on.
the
other
one
at
which
it
didn’t
have
to
reach
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
mcroberts
will
now
address
himself
to
the
other
issues
of
the
case.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
federal
law
questions
in
the
case.
questions
having
to
do
with
the
interpretation
of
the
section
5(11)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
also
having
to
do
with
the
interpretation
of
section
5(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
was
not
mentioned
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
mcroberts
will
address
himself
to
the
questions
relating
to
the
interpretation
of
the
articles
of
association
of
mopac
and
to
the
other
state
law
questions
and
generally
where
they
fit
in
to
this
litigation.
during
the
course
of
my
segment
of
the
oral
argument,
i
will
make
certain
assumptions
in
the
petitioner’s
favor,
certain
assumptions
that
they
approved
for
the
sake
of
argument,
certain
things.
first,
that
the
articles
do
apply
to
a
consolidation,
second
that
section
--
that
chapter
351
of
the
missouri
statutes
is
the
applicable
state
law
and
second
--
thirdly,
the
provision
that
they
have
to
rely
on
the
enabling
act
provision
351.270
that,
that
would
enforce
here
the
vote
that
we
are
assuming
the
charter
provides
for.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
take
issue
of
all
three
of
those
proposition
your
honor
and
we
say
that
the
--
of
course,
the
petitioners
have
to
prove
all
three
of
those;
they
have
to
prove
the
two
federal
law
propositions.
we
also
say
that
on
two
of
the
three
state
law
propositions
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
had
not
made
out
their
case.
now
the
result
of
accepting
the
petitioners
claim
here
i’d
like
to
talk
about
that
just
briefly
because
i
don’t
think
it’s
been
fully
stated.
the
petitioners
have
suggested
to
you
that
the
terms
of
the
plan
of
consolidation
have
something
to
do
with
whether
their
position
leads
them
to
a
class
vote
on
a
consolidation.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
their
position
is
correct
and
what
they
assert,
they
would
have
a
class
vote
on
every
merger
or
consolidation
to
which
mopac
might
be
a
party.
this
is
because
there
is
a
provision
in
this
very
same
section
of
the
articles,
if
they
rely
on
and
if
these
articles
apply
to
a
consolidation
with
respect
to
sub-items
b
and
c
and
d,
c
and
d
as
they
suggest
there
is
no
reason
why
sub-item
a
doesn’t
apply
and
that
says
that
there
is
a
class
vote,
we
say
not
applicable
to
consolidation,
they
say
applicable
to
a
consolidation.
if
the
company
shall
issue
any
shares
of
stock
of
the
company
of
any
class
now
or
hereafter
authorized
in
addition
to
the
shares
authorized
at
the
time
of
the
reorganization.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
any
increase
in
the
capital
stock
of
mopac,
on
a
consolidation
and
it’s
impossible
to
think
of
a
consolidation
except
with
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
where
that
wouldn’t
be
the
case.
then,
if
that’s
true,
if
their
position
is
true,
they
have
a
class
vote
on
every
merger
or
consolidation
to
which
mopac
would
be
a
party.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
we
suggest
that
when
the
proposition
is
seen
in
that
extent,
the
inconsistency
of
section
5(11)
with
that
proposition
becomes
more
manifest.
the
fact
of
the
matter
here
is
that
the
stockholder
vote
does
not
approve
or
finally
approve
any
of
these
mergers.
the
stockholder
vote
and
i
think
this
is
particularly
relevant
to
mr.
justice
black’s
question.
the
stockholder
vote
is
just
a
ticket
of
admission
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
if
you
require
a
class
vote
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they
can
and
the
question
is
what
vote
did
congress
provides
for
the
stockholders
as
a
ticket
of
admission
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
if
this
plan
of
consolidation
is
all
the
things,
that
the
petitioners
say
it
is
and
incidentally
we
dispute
them,
but
they
are
not
we
submit
in
this
case.
if
it’s
all
that
the
petitioners
say
it
is,
presumably
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
not
find
under
section
5(2)
that
the
terms
of
the
consolidation
where
just
and
reasonable
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
consolidation.
the
purpose
then
of
the
narrow
issue
of
law,
federal
law
and
the
state
law
that
we’re
discussing
today
is
whether
this
plan
will
even
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
its
review
of
the
public
interest
factors,
and
for
its
review
of
whether
the
terms
both
as
between
the
different
classes
of
stockholders
and
with
respect
to
the
public
stockholders
of
texas
and
pacific,
those
terms
are
just
unreasonable.
now,
we’ve
heard
considerable
amount
of
discussion
as
to
the
terms
of
the
class
voting
here
being
required
by
the
i.c.c.
or
imposed
into
the
articles
of
the
i.c.c.
systems.
mr.
mcroberts
will
address
himself
to
that,
he
was
there
at
that
time
and
we
believe,
he
will
show
that
is
not
the
case.
however,
even
if
it
were
the
case,
it’s
a
little
hard
to
imagine
why
the
i.c.c.
would
have
been
intended
this
class
voting
provision
to
apply
to
consolidations
when
rail
consolidation
are
subject
to
the
most
plenary
of
i.c.c.
jurisdiction.
i.c.c.
jurisdiction
to
examine
the
terms
of
the
fairness
of
the
plan
and
then
of
course
judicial
review
of
the
i.c.c.’s
order
after
the
i.c.c.’s
order
is
made.
the
first
thing
that
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
in
construing
section
511
is
its
language
and
the
critical
word
we
submit
is
the
word
that
counsel
kept
leaving
out
until
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
him
to
read
the
statute
and
that
is
the
word
required.
congress
provided
in
section
511
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
submit
a
merger
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
its
scrutiny,
if
the
merger
or
consolidation
was
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
votes
of
the
holders
of
the
shares
entitled
to
vote
of
the
capital
stock
of
the
carrier.
unless,
and
this
is
the
only
unless
clause.
unless
a
different
vote
is
required
under
applicable
state
law
in
which
case
the
numbers
so
required
shall
assent
of
the
votes
of
the
holders
of
the
shares
entitled
to
vote.
now,
we
start
with
the
general
proposition
that
congress
in
passing
the
1940
transportation
act,
which
is
where
this
language
came
into
the
statute,
the
prior
version
of
the
statute
clearly
differed
to
state
charters,
to
state
law
and
state
charters
and
to
any
provision
that
would
be
enforceable
under
any
authority
against
the
carrier.
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
facilitate
consolidations
and
mergers
in
the
rail
industry.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that.
we
submit
that
in
order
to
fulfill
that
interpretation,
the
more
literal
meaning
of
the
statute
would
coincide
with
the
federal
policy.
the
least
complicated
the
vote
is,
the
simpler
it
is
the
more
in
the
direction
of
a
simple
majority
vote
and
only
a
narrow
exception
from
that.
the
more
the
federal
policy
would
be
fulfilled
of
getting
these
mergers
to
the
commerce
commission
where
the
commissioner
could
take
a
look
at
them.
now,
it’s
a
strange
use
of
language
we
submit
to
say
that
missouri
law
requires
even
if
we
assume
that
the
articles
in
missouri
law
are
what
the
petitioners
say
they
are,
that
it
requires
a
class
vote
here.
if
i
make
a
contract
with
a
man
to
paint
my
fence,
it’s
a
strange
way
of
saying
that
virginia
law
requires
him
to
paint
my
fence
and
i
think
a
more
normal
way
of
putting
that
would
be
that
the
contract
required
him
to
paint
my
fence
and
that
virginia
law
presumably
would
give
effect
to
that
contract.
that
is
the
literal
we
submit
meaning
of
this
federal
statute.
the
interpretation
of
the
petitioners
violates
not
only
the
underlying
policy
of
the
whole
statute,
but
the
usages
in
common
speech
and
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
say
the
contract
required
and
that
the
law
will
enforce
that
contract.
there
is
an
there
is
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well
it’s
a
distinction
we
submit
that
congress
made
in
the
statute
and
they
very
easily
could
have
left
the
old
language
of
the
statute
in.
it’s
a
distinction
we
submit
that
congress
made
and
there
are
good
reasons
for
it
in
terms
of
the
background,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
we’ll
come
to
in
a
moment.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
the
property
rights
of
the
stockholders
here
will
be
amply
protected
by
the
i.c.c.
and
we
assume
by
the
district
court
when
it
reviews
the
i.c.c.’s
order
and
by
this
court
should
an
appeal
be
taken
from
the
district
court’s
order.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
submit
that
the
federal
statute
here
overrides
the
contract
rights,
assuming
that
they
have
a
contract
right,
just
as
in
the
schwabacher
case
under
state
law
therein,
actually
this
was
a
requirement
of
state
law,
there
were
dissenter’s
appraisal
rights,
the
stockholders
who
didn’t
like
the
merger
there
or
if
state
law
were
governing,
were
entitled
to
be
paid
off
in
cash
and
this
court
said
that
maybe
the
case
under
state
law,
but
section
511
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
it
certainly
does
differ
as
to
the
requirements
of
state
law
and
it
uses
that
word
required
twice
--
required
under
a
state
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
from
required
by
there
maybe,
your
honor
there
maybe
some
slight
difference,
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
think
it
material.
i
think
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
congress
to
have
made
the
distinction
between
that
which
was
required
by
state
law
that
--
and
on
that
which
was
required
by
corporate
charters.
actually
in
order
to
do
that
they
could
have
left
the
law
alone.
could
have
left
it
the
way
it
was
under
the
1920
statute.
in
essence
what
the
petitioners
are
saying
here
is
that
this
very
distinct
change
of
language
from
section
56(c)
later
section
54
of
the
1920
act
means
nothing
at
all,
that
you
have
a
plenary
reference
into
the
articles
wherever
the
articles
are
not
denied
in
enforcement
by
state
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
actually
my
case
doesn’t
depend
--
the
petitioner’s
case
depends
on
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
because
we
have
the
three
state
law
points,
actually
there’s
a
second
federal
law
point
that
i’ll
come
to
shortly.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes
your
honor
that
is
the
basic
federal
law
point,
and
that
is
the
point.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
which
we
haven’t
come
to
yet.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
that’s
what
the
complaint
says
certainly,
your
honor,
we’re
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now
let
me
say
that
the
--
most
of
the
methods
of
valuation
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
petitioners
here
would
insist
on
we
find
totally
irrelevant
in
the
context.
they
are
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well
that
is
correct
your
honor,
let’s
assume
that
this
was
a
monstrous
fraud
as
the
complaints
say.
let’s
assume
then
that
we
made
a
deal
with
alleghany
to
go
along
with
it
for
some
backhanded
consideration
and
there
is
an
approving
class
vote,
you
go
to
the
commission
and
assume
the
commission
starts
the
hearings,
then
you
have
that
issue.
you
have
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
plan
is
just
and
reasonable
and
that
the
parties
could
put
evidence
on
it
at
that
time.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
this
plan
will
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
if
the
court
recalls
that
in
effect
this
class
of
stock
has
a
veto,
any
provision
in
any
articles
of
incorporation,
let’s
say
that
a
particular
class
is
to
have
a
class
vote
on
consolidations.
any
such
provision
will
have
to
be
honored
under
section
511
and
those
consolidations
involving
those
railroads
would
never
even
be
started
without
the
approval
not
only
of
the
general
vote
of
the
stockholders
and
of
the
board
of
directors,
but
of
each
class
that
in
the
corporate
charter
had
back
prior
before
the
1940
act
perhaps
obtained
such
a
concession.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
the
i.c.c.
has
taken
no
view
on
this.
the
application
has
not
been
pressed
by
the
petitioners,
by
the
respondents
as
long
as
this
case
has
been
going--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
if
we
get
back
to
the
position
then
that
the
charter
provisions
don’t
talk
about
consolidation
at
all,
and
it
would
be
rather
odd
to
say
that
the
commission
--
one
of
the
aids
to
interpretation
that
they
don’t
apply
the
consolidations
is
that
there’d
be
no
purpose
for
the
commission
to
protect
the
parties
against
the
commission,
since
the
commissions
review
of
the
terms
of
the
consolidation
as
plenary.
it’s
unlike
some
of
the
other
things
that
are
provided
for
in
the
articles
where
either
the
commission
has
no
reviewing
power
at
all
or
where
it’s
reviewing
power
is
limited
to
issues
like
stock
watering
matters
of
that,
sort
of
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
i.c.c.
has
taken
no
action
whatsoever
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it’s
issued
no
order
at
all.
the
application
has
been
filed.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
i.c.c.
is
--
the
only
action
that
has
been
taken
i
believe
by
the
i.c.c’s
file
room
is
let
us
file
the
application
and
there
have
been
no
proceedings
on
the
application.
this
suit
was
brought
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
the
private
parties
here
brought
a
bill
for
injunction
in
the
district
court
before
a
single
district
judge
involving
the
diversities
of
jurisdiction.
and
the
only
question
tended
to
this
court
on
that
bill
is
not
the
justice
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
plan
which
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well
the
i.c.c.
in
terms
of
the
vote
that
would
generally
apply
for
election
of
directors
say,
the
i.c.c.
insisted
that
the
election
of
directors
and
the
general
corporate
matters,
the
general
voting
power
be
the
way
that
it
is.
they
--
the
class
b
stock
then
said
we
should
have
twice
as
many
shares
as
you’re
proposing
to
give
us
and
that
would
give
us
4%
of
the
vote.
wouldn’t
it
be
fair
to
give
us
4%
of
the
vote
and
i.c.c.
said
absolutely
not.
they
have
only
a
minuscule
interest
in
this
corporation;
they’re
being
treated
generously
enough
by
being
given
2%
of
the
vote.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
suppose
they
would
your
honor,
that’s
a
condition
pursuant
to
the
exercise
of
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no
one
ever
has,
we
have
not.
the
petitioners
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don’t
believe
--
sorry
your
honor
i
maybe
mistaken
but
no
party
has
seriously
pressed
this
and
actually
what
we
have
here
is
a
naked
question
i
believe
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
oh
it
did
also,
but
those
issues
were
separate
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
that’s
perfectly
a
clear
case
of
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
would
have
to
be
reversed.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i’m
not
sure
that
the
statute
provides
that
as
one
of
their
findings,
the
statute
provides
that
that’s
one
of
things
that
has
to
take
place,
that
there
has
to
be
the
approval
of
the
commission
and
the
assents
of
the
stockholders.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
your
honor,
i
wouldn’t
attempt
to
suggest
what
you
might
do,
but
i
believe
that
this
does
not
partake
of
the
sort
of
the
questions
of
the
court
has
generally
held
to
be
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
rationale,
it’s
a
pure
question
of
--
for
the
three
points,
the
interpretation
of
state
law
and
what
the
i.c.c.
would
know
about
that
as
problematical.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
and
the
--
quite
right.
and
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it’s
only
when
you
pass
through
the
state
law
questions
that
you
come
to
the
federal
law
questions.
so
if
the
i.c.c.
was
to
attempt
to
determine
this,
it
could
not
even
reach
the
federal
law
questions,
but
we
contend
that
the
federal
law
questions
here
are
pure
issues
of
law
and
that
they
could
be
decided
by
the
federal
courts
and
an
action
of
bill
and
equity,
unlike
as
your
honor
quite
rightly
points
out
the
question
of
justice
and
reasonableness
which
is
reserved
for
another
day.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
there
is
your
honor,
we
set
it
forth
an
extensive
in
our
briefs.
one
of
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
i
will
your
honor.
the
basic
problems
with
the
1920
transportation
act,
which
clearly
said
what
the
petitioners
say
the
1940
act
says.
one
of
the
basic
problems
of
course
was
that
it
had
this
requirement
of
a
master
plan.
the
other
problem
that
was
found
and
the
commentators
speak
to
this,
is
the
fact
that
minority
groups
were
able
to
tie
up
consolidations
and
mergers
and
prevent
them
from
proceeding
and
all
during
the
20s
and
30s
there
were
bills
introduced
in
effect
to
do
away
with
the
old
provision
of
section
56(c)
which
made
this
deference
to
the
corporate
charters
and
to
provide
a
federal
voting
standard.
some
of
the
bills
provided
a
majority
general
vote,
some
of
them
provided
a
two-thirds
general
vote.
the
comment
was
made
of
all
these
bills
were
being
considered
under
the
1920
act,
that
maybe
a
majority
vote
was
too
low
and
a
lot
of
the
states
required
a
general
two-thirds
vote.
now
nothing
directly
and
immediately
came
out
of
these
bills.
the
interest
died
to
a
certain
extent
during
the
depression,
interest
died
in
rail
consolidations.
but
these
problems
were
very
much
there,
they
had
been
repeatedly
put
forward
by
the
railroad
trade
associations
that
the
deferring
to
state
law
that
was
the
old
practice
created
deferring
to
the
charters
and
the
state
law
that
was
the
previous
practice,
created
a
considerable
problem
and
permitted
what
one
commentator
called
troublesome
minorities
to
block
these
plans.
now,
we
submit
that
when
and
again
the
last
committee
reports,
when
we
come
to
the
1939,
when
this
bill
was
finally,
virtually
passed,
it’s
funny
enacted
the
next
year.
the
committee
reports
don’t
say
anything
one
way
or
the
other
on
this
point,
but
we
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
the
classical
theory
of
interpreting
a
statute
that
you
look
to
the
problem,
that
the
prior
law
presented
and
this
was
a
problem
that
was
generally
recognized,
that
the
preferable
interpretation
of
the
statute
against
the
light
of
that
problem
and
against
the
light
of
this
congressional
concern
is
that
it
made
a
minimal
reference
to
state
law
simply
to
the
affirmative
expressions
of
state
public
policy.
the
state
law
requirements,
the
most
typical
one
being
for
a
two-thirds
general
vote.
then
in
effect
this
provision
is
compromised
between
the
old
provisions
of
federal
bills
that
had
been
introduced
over
the
years,
some
of
which
provided
for
a
majority
vote,
some
of
which
provided
for
two-thirds
vote.
this
act
we
submit
says
that
the
general
rule
is
a
majority
vote
if
the
state
law
imposes
a
positive
requirement
for
more
that
will
be
accepted.
now,
our
second
point
on
the
federal
law
is
that
even
if
the
provisions
of
section
511
are
broad
enough
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that’s
the
high
spots
of
it
your
honor,
we
have
of
course
in
more
detail
in
our
brief,
one
of
the
important
things
i
think
further
is
that
there
were
very
few
provisions
of
the
sort
that
the
petitioners
are
now
relying
on
in
1940,
when
congress
thought
about
required
under
state
law,
it
was
thinking
about
the
affirmative
requirements
of
state
law
to
the
effect
that
you
have
to
have
two-thirds
or
three-fifths
vote
on
a
merger.
these
statutes
giving
effect
to
provisions
of
corporate
charters
were
not
general
then,
they
were
only
four
at
that
time.
they
did
not
really
begin
to
come
into
the
picture
in
great
number
until
the
model
business
corporation
act
was
promulgated
in
1950.
we
say
further
as
our
second
point
of
federal
law
that
even
if
the
statute
is
read
as
giving
effect
to,
well
i
call
it
voluntary
or
permissible
vote
under
state
law;
it
would
never
give
effect
to
a
class
vote.
first,
we
refer
again
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
talks
about
votes
required
under
state
law
varying
the
federal
standard,
but
the
only
way
in
which
the
federal
standard,
which
is
for
a
majority
general
vote
can
be
varied
is
with
respect
to
the
number
of
the
votes
of
the
holders
of
the
shares
entitled
to
vote
of
the
capital
stock
of
such
corporation.
we
say
that
on
its
face
this
means
that
you
can
vary
the
number,
you
can
say
and
so
the
majority
of
that
shall
be
two-thirds
or
three-fourths
or
three-fifths
that
says
nothing
at
all
about
class
voting
or
about
giving
any
effect
to
state
laws
that
permit
the
vote
to
be
taken
other
than
on
a
general
basis.
now,
there
were
in
the
late
30s
bills
before
congress,
which
would
have
done
just
that.
i.c.c.
commissioner
eastman’s
bill
provided
for
a
class
vote
and
certainly
congress
at
that
time
was
what
commissioner
eastman
produced
a
very
respectful
hearing,
but
what
congress
came
out
with
did
not
provide
for
a
class
vote.
moreover,
there
are
other
provisions
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
there
were
some,
there
were
fewer
bills
in
the
late
30s,
but
eastman’s
bill
did
come
out
in
‘36
and
is
forth
report
as
coordinator
of
transportation.
now,
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
section
20b
is
the
example,
which
provide
for
a
class
vote.
these
provisions
show
that
when
congress
wanted
there
to
be
a
class
vote,
it
provided
so
in
terms.
we
submit
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
congress
did
not
provide
for
a
class
vote
here
was
the
fact
that
a
class
vote
in
the
ordinary
corporation
is
simply
a
guarantee
of
the
fairness
of
the
plan
that
it
affects
all
classes
of
the
stockholders
fairly.
here
we
have
an
administrative
control
over
the
fairness
of
the
fund.
so
we
submit
that
on
both
these
grounds
of
federal
law,
one
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
went
on.
the
other
one
at
which
it
didn’t
have
to
reach
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
mcroberts
will
now
address
himself
to
the
other
issues
of
the
case.
