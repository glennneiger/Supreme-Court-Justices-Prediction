be
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
have
you
thought
about
a
(inaudible)
that
this
case
might
be
governed
in
part
by
the
state
law
and
in
part
by
the
federal
law,
and
it
is
basic
positive
fact
that
half
of
it
should
not
be
taken
away
from
one
group
and
given
to
another,
but
that
the
value
should
be
saved
as
it
were,
that
federal
law
would
control
all
that
points.
have
you
thought
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
the
basic
principle
in
federal
law
said
no
merger
or
consolidation
could
be
done
in
such
ways,
to
take
away
the
validators
of
one
group
of
stockholders
and
give
it
(inaudible)
to
the
other.
you
would
think
then
that
federal
law
would
--
that
the
federal
statute
the
basic
premise
of
federal
law
wouldn't
control
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
the
statute
was
construed,
that
meaning
and
a
division
of
the
stock
in
the
new
company
on
the
basis
by
one
person’s
property
value
that
wouldn’t
be
bodily
lifted
away
from
him
for
that
reason
and
given
to
the
other
group,
why
would
that
not
be
the
controlling
norm.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you’ll
pardon
me,
that
seems
to
me
like
it’s
a
little
early
to
renounce
that
not
being
your
case.
what
you
have
is
a
claim
for
stockholders
who
had
passed
the
stock
with
large
amount
of
money,
that
was
the
value,
that
was
their
property.
another
group
had
a
class
of
stock
that
wasn’t
worth
anything
like
that,
but
tremendously
less
that.
then
it
is
emerged,
it’s
emerged
in
such
a
way
that
when
it
gets
through
(inaudible),
so
that
when
they
get
through
the
values
of
the
one
group
of
stockholder
would
have
been
finally
taken
over
and
given
to
the
other
for
no
reason
in
world
except
the
number
of
shares
which
happen
to
represent
that
difference
respective
value.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
thought
and
that
precisely
is
one
of
the
problems
we
have
to
decide
whether
a
federal
law
permits
taking
of
one
group
of
stockholders
value,
giving
them
to
another
simply
because
they
were
represented
by
different
numbers,
that
is
not
too
difficult.
justice
hugo
l.
black
stockholder
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
necessarily
refers
to
the
number
of
stock
certificates
even
though
had
originally
created
–-
was
created
in
a
manner
where
some
stocks
certificates
were
wholly
disparate
from
their
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
that
be
a
valid
statute?
if
that
was
the
federal
statute
how
could
it
be
valid?
how
could
it
be
valid
by
law
of
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government
said
that
you
could
use
a
device
a
number
of
shares,
so
as
to
take
away
in
a
merger
or
consolidation
a
tremendous
value
of
one
group
of
stockholders
and
turn
it
bodily
over
to
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
assert
that
it’s
constitutional
if
construed
like
they
say
the
state
law
requires
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that’s
in
your
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
number
of
a
shares
which
went
the
majority
were
in
a
condition
to
take
away
the
property
of
the
other
shareholders
how
could
that
withstand
the
scrutiny
of
due
process
of

justice

assuming
that
one
should
believe
as
i
tend
to

at

the

did
upset
the

as

we

the

of
proving
what
the

said

might

might
make

unconstitutional.
justice

assuming
that
the

--
we
should
agree

we
should
decide,
fine
that
they
did

the

did

that
the

the

mr.

well,
i’m
not

i’m
talking
about
this
method
of

giving
each
owner
of
each
share
stock.
justice
hugo

is
there
is
any
importance
at
all
to
the
vote
of
the
stockholder
on
the
approval
or

of
a

mention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
has
a
bearing
in

justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
is
important
or
unimportant
in
the
process
of

justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
see
anything
fair
and
good
in
a
vote
which
allows
neither
to
be
submitted,
the
vote
by
those
that
are
very,
very,
very,
small
parts
that
people
can
override
the
vote
of
others
who
have
a
greater
valuation.
justice
hugo
l.

but
then,
if
you
defend
the
method
of
voting
here,
how
can
you
do
it,
if
it
is
having
any
possibility
of
fairness?
justice
hugo
l.

if
you
had
100
stockholders,
in

98

amount
of

that
those

justice

what
is
the
value,
value,
value,
one
value,
one
vote
you
might
say,
but
certainly
does
not
sound
better.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
substantial
step
of
great
importance,
connection
with
the
merger
and
you’ve
submitted
to
us,
which
would
permit

would
require
that
they
be
squeezed
to
death
by
the
vote
of
the

justice

why
is
that
a
plan
is
submitted
to
the

that
would
not

you
just
said
that
they
can
take
it
all
away
from
you.
justice

maybe
it
was.
justice

it
is
just
the

justice

the

what
you
are
defending
here,
the

that
that
the

you
