mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
say
at
the
very
outset
and
particularly
to
mr.
justice
black
that
we
do
not
contend
that
any
law
state
or
federal
gives
to
us
or
to
any
party
power
to
take
away
the
property
and
rights
of
one
group
of
stockholders
and
turn
them
over
to
another.
if
this
plan
does
that,
which
we
emphatically
deny,
of
course
the
interstate
commerce
commission
will
say
that
it
is
not
just
and
reasonable.
and
it
is
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
congress
has
delegated
the
authority,
to
their
expertise
to
decide
whether
or
not
regardless
of
vote
majority,
class
vote,
two-thirds
vote
or
any
vote,
whether
a
plan
is
just
and
reasonable
so
far
as
a
few
remaining
minority
stockholders
are
concerned.
if
it
is
not
just
and
reasonable,
then
presumably
and
i
am
sure
they
will,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
say
so.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
not
so
far.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
has
no
bearing
upon
whether
a
plan
is
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
kind
of
vote,
yes
your
honor,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
is
true
in
any
plain
majority
vote
or
in
two-thirds
vote.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i’ll
tell
you
there
is
just
as
fair,
where
there
is
just
as
much
possibility
of
unfairness
in
any
provision
whether
it
be
for
a
majority
of
vote
or
a
two-thirds
vote
or
a
three-fourth
vote,
or
a
90%
vote
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
petitioners
are
contending,
their
2%
decides
not
on
the
fairness
or
unfairness.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
mr.
justice
they
can
no
more
be
squeezed
by
this
vote
than
they
can
if
there
is
no
class
vote
and
the
statute
requires
as
of
the
third
statute
requires
a
two-thirds
vote.
the
two-thirds
can
squeeze
the
one-third,
except
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
must
find
a
plan
just
and
reasonable
or
it
will
not
be
passed
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
the
only
thing
that
i
suspect
--
the
only
thing
that
is
troubling
your
honor
is
the
allegation
here
that
this
is
an
unfair
plan.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
then
mr.
justice
the
same
principles
would
apply
if
there
were
no
class
vote.
if
99%
of
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
if
99%
of
the
stockholder
vote
in
favor
of
this
plan
and
1%
vote
against
it
and
it
goes
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
must
protect
that
1%
against
this
vote
of
the
99%.
and
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
question
of
class
vote
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
this
plan.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
the
class
vote,
which
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
use
to
prevent
this
plan
being
submitted
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
your
honor,
please
they
do
not
want
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
fairness
of
the
plan.
we
want
to
go
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
but,
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
may
i
suggest
here
your
honor
that
very
issue
was
raised
in
the
petitions
in
this
case
was
not
decided
by
the
district
court,
but
was
reserved
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
is
not
within
our
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
is
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
way
of
submitting
a
plan
is
not
unfair,
no
it’s
not
unfair
in
any
sense
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
am
saying
not
only
the
way
of
submitting
it
is
not
unfair,
but
the
plan
itself
is
alleged
to
be
unfair,
we
do
not
concede
that
and
if
it
is
unfair
the
commission
will
throw
it
up,
instead.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked,
whether
or
not
there
is
any
statute
in
missouri
calling
for
a
class
vote
on
consolidation
of
emergency,
the
answer
is
possibly,
no.
and
i
want
to
come
back
to
that
in
just
a
moment
to
show
just
what
missouri
did
do
in
that
respect
and
why
missouri
rejected
expressly
and
possibly
rejected
the
idea
of
a
class
vote
on
a
merger
or
consolidation.
now,
several
of
the
justices
have
indicated
that
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
consider.
the
questions
of
state
law
and
i
simply
point
out
that
in
order
for
the
petitioners
to
be
upheld
in
their
claim
for
a
class
vote.
there
are
six
hurdles
which
they
must
overcome.
this
court
or
some
court
must
hold
that
these
articles
of
incorporation
although
they
don’t
mention
mergers
or
consolidations
apply
to
mergers
and
consolidations.
the
court
of
appeals
as
we
read
the
decision,
said
it
did
not
so
provide.
the
next
thing
that
petitioners
have
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
it’s
a
matter
of
simply
just
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
of
contract
law,
shall
we
call
it,
state
or
federal
or
whatever
it
maybe.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
next
question
that
must
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
is
that
chapter
388
of
our
missouri
statute
which
deal
with
railroad
corporation
does
not
apply,
because
if
it
does
it
calls
only
for
a
simple
majority
vote.
that
issue
was
ruled
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
court
of
appeals
ruled
out
definitely
that
question
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no
they
ruled
definitely
that
chapter
351
and
not
358
applies.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
word
maybe
assume.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
any
of
that
the
effect
of
it
was
to
say
we
think
chapter
351
applies.
chapter
351
must
apply
if
the
petitioners
are
to
have
a
class
vote,
because
they
don’t
get
it
under
388.
the
railroad
statute
which
governs
consolidations
of
railroad
corporation
we’ve
discussed
at
great
length
in
our
brief
but
time
will
not
permit
me
to
go
into
now.
it’s
not
enough
for
them
to
come
under
351,
they
must
come
under
this
section
270
or
351
and
to
come
under
351
and
make
the
statement
far
simply
and
it
cannot
be
in
that
category,
that
until
july
the
18th,
1961
neither
chapter
351
nor
any
of
its
predecessors
back
to
1807
could
have
been
applicable
state
law
applying
to
this
or
any
of
railroad
merger
in
missouri.
and
that
because
chapter
351
and
its
predecessors
expressly
excluded
railroad
corporations
and
other
types
of
corporations
from
its
provisions.
the
first
statute
in
missouri
authorizing
the
merger
and
consolidation
of
corporations,
not
railroad
corporations
but
generally
was
enacted
in
1807
and
that
statute
expressly
decided
said,
that
it
should
apply
only
to
manufacturing
corporations
and
that
was
allowed
until
1921,
when
it
was
expanded
slightly,
but
not
to
include
railroad
corporations,
they
were
still
excluded.
in
1943,
our
legislature,
our
general
assembly
revised
the
entire
general
and
business
corporation
law
in
missouri
and
put
in
merger
and
consolidation
provisions
and
those
provisions
expressly
said,
they
shall
apply
only
to
corporations
organized
for
a
purpose
for
which
the
corporation
maybe
organized
under
this
act,
under
this
chapter.
and
railroad
corporation
by
express
provisions
to
the
chapter
could
not
be
organized.
so,
did
i
say
up
until
1961
there
could
not
have
been
a
class
vote
under
the
sections
on
which
they
now
rely.
what
occurred
in
1961,
there
was
an
amendment
and
the
reason
for
that
amendment,
the
purpose
of
that
amendment
was
this.
back
when
our
1943
law
was
first
enacted
it
defined
the
word
‘corporation’
as
used
in
the
chapter
so
as
to
exclude
foreign
corporations.
and
our
secretary
of
state
held
that
the
merger
and
consolidation
provisions
could
not
apply
to
any
foreign
corporation
merging
with
the
missouri
corporation
unless
the
missouri
corporation
is
a
survival.
they
undertook
to
correct
that
defect
in
our
law.
the
borrower
corporations
committee
and
the
borrower
association
drafted
and
introduced
a
bill,
had
introduced
a
bill
in
our
general
assembly
in
‘59
correcting
this
among
the
other
things,
it
failed
to
pass
it.
it
was
reintroduced
in
‘61,
the
defects
that
has
been
described
and
this
is
all
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
very
purpose
for
which
was
merely
to
correct
this
one
provision
in
our
general
corporation
law,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
railroads.
and
so,
the
petitioner’s
position
must
be
that
when
in
1961
for
the
first
time
they
came
under
chapter
351,
the
legislature
aiming
at
this
one
problem
inadvertently
hit
railroads
over
here
and
unknowingly
amended
the
railroad
code
so
as
to
make
this
section
apply
to
railroad
corporations.
we
say
it
did
not
accomplish
the
purpose
and
the
only
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
they
did
not
deal
with
that
specific
question
because
mr.
justice,
because
and
i
must
confess
it,
it
was
pointed
out
at
that
time
and
we
did
not
do
our
home
work.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
in
157.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
yes
that
part
of
351.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
means
this,
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
not
enough
that
they
come
within
chapter
351
per
se,
because
chapter
351
per
se
in
425
prescribes
a
simple,
a
straight
two-thirds
vote
of
all
the
stockholders
for
merger
and
consolidation,
that’s
all.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
how
that
section
came
into
our
law.
our
1943
law
was
copied
in
large
part
from
the
1933
law,
the
state
of
illinois.
this
particular
section
calling
for
a
two-thirds
vote
was
copied
from
the
illinois
statute,
which
would
be
found
if
you
care
to
look
at
it
in
11-a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
and
the
missouri
statute
copied
it
down
to
the
point,
down
to
the
end
as
it
appears
in
our
statute.
it
provides,
it
goes
on
down
and
copies
two-thirds
vote
of
the
outstanding
share
for
a
period.
now
illinois
statute
went
on
to
provide
for
a
class
vote
and
missouri
expressly
refused
to
carry
that
over
into
its
statute.
i
point
this
out
on
page
88
of
our
brief
and
cite
no
authority
as
indicating
the
intention
of
the
general
assembly
just
before
leaving
to
st.
louis,
it
came
to
my
attention
a
decision
of
our
supreme
court
en
banc,
unanimous
handed
down
last
month
in
missouri,
in
which
it
had
occasion
to
consider
another
statute
of
missouri,
copied
from
illinois
in
which
they
had
copied
part
of
it
and
had
left
out
certain
sections.
and
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
leave
with
the
clerk,
copies
of
this
opinion
of
our
supreme
court
to
show
the
significance
that
they
attached
to
the
fact
that
missouri
had
refused
to
follow
illinois
in
this
respect.
i
think
that
goes
perhaps
to
this
question
of
significance
of
section
311
and
the
permissive
word
in
their
requirement,
because
here
is
missouri
affirmatively
refusing
to
provide
for
a
class
vote
on
mergers
and
consolidations
that
does
not
become
a
policy
of
the
state
in
missouri
to
have
class
votes.
now
they
come
to
270
and
they
say
that
270
they
must,
must
come
under
270
of
this
is
the
another
hurdle
they
have
to
overcome.
and
the
section
to
which
your
honor
referred
in
the
opinion
says
that
270
doesn’t
accomplish
the
purpose,
because
all
270
does
and
read
the
literal
language
of
it,
is
to
say
that
if
in
your
articles,
you
provide
for
a
greater
vote
than
that
provided
in
this
chapter.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
what
the
court
was
saying
and
to
really
construe
that
you
have
to
go
back
earlier
in
this
opinion
and
time
will
not
permit
me
to
do
it
here.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
to
go
to
the
questions
which
the
court
propounded
for
itself.
if
you
go
back,
the
petitioners
say
that
the
court
didn’t
overturn
the
district
court,
but
they
go
back
to
142
you
see
they
say
the
district
court
held
us
and
so
in
this
posture
it
comes
to
us.
we
reverse,
they
overturned
it
as
definitely
and
possibly
as
i
know
how.
then
the
court
undertook
to
go
through
the
process
of
reasoning
why
it
reversed
and
how
it
arrived
at
this
conclusion
of
reversing
the
district
court
and
in
the
course
of
doing
so
it
outlined
the
questions
which
were
presented
to
it
and
one
of
the
questions
that
this
particular
language
is
directed
to,
if
i
can
turn
to
it,
i
can’t
at
the
moment
turn
to
it,
but
we
find
before
that
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
court
phrased
these
three
questions
which
it
answered
on
page
157.
it
phrased
the
questions
which
were
presented
to
it,
it
certainly
had
doubts
about
it
they
are
difficult
questions,
but
i
submit
it
finally
resolved
and
what
petitioners
are
really
objecting
to
is
not
that
they
didn’t
resolve
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
alleghany
brief
says
that
they
finally
resolved
their
doubts.
they
are
objecting
to
the
reasoning
which
the
court
of
appeals
followed
in
resolving.
the
fact
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
the
national
law
and
the
national
policy
to
facilitate
mergers
and
said
we
are
going
to
resolve
these
doubts
in
a
way
which
is
going
to
facilitate
mergers
and
consolidations
not
put
hurdles
in
the
place
of
them,
we
leave
it
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
decide
whether
it
is
fair
and
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
he
makes
a
distinction.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
i
think
and
i
think
if
–
may,
i
answer
your
question
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
what
congress
was
doing
here.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
this
is
an
answer
i
may
to
the
question.
congress
was
differing
in
this
unless
a
different
vote
is
required
by
the
state
law
to
the
policy
as
expressed
by
the
law
of
the
state
as
embodied
in
the
statutes
of
the
state.
i
think
that
is
what
congress
was
differing
to
when
it
put
that
qualifying
language
in
the
statute
and
not
to
what
the
parties
might
do
by
private
contract
even
though
it
would
be
enforced
and
given
effect
to
by
the
courts
of
the
state.
now
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i’m
not
as
familiar
with
that
legislative
history
as
mr.
lyons
is
and
i
cannot
point
to
a
specific
sector.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
i
cannot
cite,
i
cannot
cite
legislative
history
in
congress,
but
i
can
say
that
in
doing
my
brief
a
decision
of
our
supreme
court
that
says
that
in
another
situation
where
they’re
talking
about
state
law,
their
main
state
statutory
law.
and
our
supreme
court
has
also
held
that
these
private
provisions
such
as
voting
rights,
although
it
wasn’t
that
in
articles
of
association
are
a
matter
of
private
contact
and
not
public
law
and
that
is
what
our
supreme
court
has
held
in
the
shapiro
case.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
say
at
the
very
outset
and
particularly
to
mr.
justice
black
that
we
do
not
contend
that
any
law
state
or
federal
gives
to
us
or
to
any
party
power
to
take
away
the
property
and
rights
of
one
group
of
stockholders
and
turn
them
over
to
another.
if
this
plan
does
that,
which
we
emphatically
deny,
of
course
the
interstate
commerce
commission
will
say
that
it
is
not
just
and
reasonable.
and
it
is
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
congress
has
delegated
the
authority,
to
their
expertise
to
decide
whether
or
not
regardless
of
vote
majority,
class
vote,
two-thirds
vote
or
any
vote,
whether
a
plan
is
just
and
reasonable
so
far
as
a
few
remaining
minority
stockholders
are
concerned.
if
it
is
not
just
and
reasonable,
then
presumably
and
i
am
sure
they
will,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
say
so.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
not
so
far.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
has
no
bearing
upon
whether
a
plan
is
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
kind
of
vote,
yes
your
honor,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
is
true
in
any
plain
majority
vote
or
in
two-thirds
vote.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i’ll
tell
you
there
is
just
as
fair,
where
there
is
just
as
much
possibility
of
unfairness
in
any
provision
whether
it
be
for
a
majority
of
vote
or
a
two-thirds
vote
or
a
three-fourth
vote,
or
a
90%
vote
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
petitioners
are
contending,
their
2%
decides
not
on
the
fairness
or
unfairness.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
mr.
justice
they
can
no
more
be
squeezed
by
this
vote
than
they
can
if
there
is
no
class
vote
and
the
statute
requires
as
of
the
third
statute
requires
a
two-thirds
vote.
the
two-thirds
can
squeeze
the
one-third,
except
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
must
find
a
plan
just
and
reasonable
or
it
will
not
be
passed
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
the
only
thing
that
i
suspect
--
the
only
thing
that
is
troubling
your
honor
is
the
allegation
here
that
this
is
an
unfair
plan.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
then
mr.
justice
the
same
principles
would
apply
if
there
were
no
class
vote.
if
99%
of
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
if
99%
of
the
stockholder
vote
in
favor
of
this
plan
and
1%
vote
against
it
and
it
goes
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
must
protect
that
1%
against
this
vote
of
the
99%.
and
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
question
of
class
vote
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
this
plan.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
the
class
vote,
which
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
use
to
prevent
this
plan
being
submitted
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
your
honor,
please
they
do
not
want
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
fairness
of
the
plan.
we
want
to
go
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
but,
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
may
i
suggest
here
your
honor
that
very
issue
was
raised
in
the
petitions
in
this
case
was
not
decided
by
the
district
court,
but
was
reserved
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
is
not
within
our
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
is
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
way
of
submitting
a
plan
is
not
unfair,
no
it’s
not
unfair
in
any
sense
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
am
saying
not
only
the
way
of
submitting
it
is
not
unfair,
but
the
plan
itself
is
alleged
to
be
unfair,
we
do
not
concede
that
and
if
it
is
unfair
the
commission
will
throw
it
up,
instead.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked,
whether
or
not
there
is
any
statute
in
missouri
calling
for
a
class
vote
on
consolidation
of
emergency,
the
answer
is
possibly,
no.
and
i
want
to
come
back
to
that
in
just
a
moment
to
show
just
what
missouri
did
do
in
that
respect
and
why
missouri
rejected
expressly
and
possibly
rejected
the
idea
of
a
class
vote
on
a
merger
or
consolidation.
now,
several
of
the
justices
have
indicated
that
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
consider.
the
questions
of
state
law
and
i
simply
point
out
that
in
order
for
the
petitioners
to
be
upheld
in
their
claim
for
a
class
vote.
there
are
six
hurdles
which
they
must
overcome.
this
court
or
some
court
must
hold
that
these
articles
of
incorporation
although
they
don’t
mention
mergers
or
consolidations
apply
to
mergers
and
consolidations.
the
court
of
appeals
as
we
read
the
decision,
said
it
did
not
so
provide.
the
next
thing
that
petitioners
have
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
it’s
a
matter
of
simply
just
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
of
contract
law,
shall
we
call
it,
state
or
federal
or
whatever
it
maybe.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
next
question
that
must
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
is
that
chapter
388
of
our
missouri
statute
which
deal
with
railroad
corporation
does
not
apply,
because
if
it
does
it
calls
only
for
a
simple
majority
vote.
that
issue
was
ruled
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
court
of
appeals
ruled
out
definitely
that
question
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no
they
ruled
definitely
that
chapter
351
and
not
358
applies.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
word
maybe
assume.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
any
of
that
the
effect
of
it
was
to
say
we
think
chapter
351
applies.
chapter
351
must
apply
if
the
petitioners
are
to
have
a
class
vote,
because
they
don’t
get
it
under
388.
the
railroad
statute
which
governs
consolidations
of
railroad
corporation
we’ve
discussed
at
great
length
in
our
brief
but
time
will
not
permit
me
to
go
into
now.
it’s
not
enough
for
them
to
come
under
351,
they
must
come
under
this
section
270
or
351
and
to
come
under
351
and
make
the
statement
far
simply
and
it
cannot
be
in
that
category,
that
until
july
the
18th,
1961
neither
chapter
351
nor
any
of
its
predecessors
back
to
1807
could
have
been
applicable
state
law
applying
to
this
or
any
of
railroad
merger
in
missouri.
and
that
because
chapter
351
and
its
predecessors
expressly
excluded
railroad
corporations
and
other
types
of
corporations
from
its
provisions.
the
first
statute
in
missouri
authorizing
the
merger
and
consolidation
of
corporations,
not
railroad
corporations
but
generally
was
enacted
in
1807
and
that
statute
expressly
decided
said,
that
it
should
apply
only
to
manufacturing
corporations
and
that
was
allowed
until
1921,
when
it
was
expanded
slightly,
but
not
to
include
railroad
corporations,
they
were
still
excluded.
in
1943,
our
legislature,
our
general
assembly
revised
the
entire
general
and
business
corporation
law
in
missouri
and
put
in
merger
and
consolidation
provisions
and
those
provisions
expressly
said,
they
shall
apply
only
to
corporations
organized
for
a
purpose
for
which
the
corporation
maybe
organized
under
this
act,
under
this
chapter.
and
railroad
corporation
by
express
provisions
to
the
chapter
could
not
be
organized.
so,
did
i
say
up
until
1961
there
could
not
have
been
a
class
vote
under
the
sections
on
which
they
now
rely.
what
occurred
in
1961,
there
was
an
amendment
and
the
reason
for
that
amendment,
the
purpose
of
that
amendment
was
this.
back
when
our
1943
law
was
first
enacted
it
defined
the
word
‘corporation’
as
used
in
the
chapter
so
as
to
exclude
foreign
corporations.
and
our
secretary
of
state
held
that
the
merger
and
consolidation
provisions
could
not
apply
to
any
foreign
corporation
merging
with
the
missouri
corporation
unless
the
missouri
corporation
is
a
survival.
they
undertook
to
correct
that
defect
in
our
law.
the
borrower
corporations
committee
and
the
borrower
association
drafted
and
introduced
a
bill,
had
introduced
a
bill
in
our
general
assembly
in
‘59
correcting
this
among
the
other
things,
it
failed
to
pass
it.
it
was
reintroduced
in
‘61,
the
defects
that
has
been
described
and
this
is
all
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
very
purpose
for
which
was
merely
to
correct
this
one
provision
in
our
general
corporation
law,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
railroads.
and
so,
the
petitioner’s
position
must
be
that
when
in
1961
for
the
first
time
they
came
under
chapter
351,
the
legislature
aiming
at
this
one
problem
inadvertently
hit
railroads
over
here
and
unknowingly
amended
the
railroad
code
so
as
to
make
this
section
apply
to
railroad
corporations.
we
say
it
did
not
accomplish
the
purpose
and
the
only
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
they
did
not
deal
with
that
specific
question
because
mr.
justice,
because
and
i
must
confess
it,
it
was
pointed
out
at
that
time
and
we
did
not
do
our
home
work.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
in
157.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
yes
that
part
of
351.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
means
this,
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
not
enough
that
they
come
within
chapter
351
per
se,
because
chapter
351
per
se
in
425
prescribes
a
simple,
a
straight
two-thirds
vote
of
all
the
stockholders
for
merger
and
consolidation,
that’s
all.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
how
that
section
came
into
our
law.
our
1943
law
was
copied
in
large
part
from
the
1933
law,
the
state
of
illinois.
this
particular
section
calling
for
a
two-thirds
vote
was
copied
from
the
illinois
statute,
which
would
be
found
if
you
care
to
look
at
it
in
11-a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
and
the
missouri
statute
copied
it
down
to
the
point,
down
to
the
end
as
it
appears
in
our
statute.
it
provides,
it
goes
on
down
and
copies
two-thirds
vote
of
the
outstanding
share
for
a
period.
now
illinois
statute
went
on
to
provide
for
a
class
vote
and
missouri
expressly
refused
to
carry
that
over
into
its
statute.
i
point
this
out
on
page
88
of
our
brief
and
cite
no
authority
as
indicating
the
intention
of
the
general
assembly
just
before
leaving
to
st.
louis,
it
came
to
my
attention
a
decision
of
our
supreme
court
en
banc,
unanimous
handed
down
last
month
in
missouri,
in
which
it
had
occasion
to
consider
another
statute
of
missouri,
copied
from
illinois
in
which
they
had
copied
part
of
it
and
had
left
out
certain
sections.
and
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
leave
with
the
clerk,
copies
of
this
opinion
of
our
supreme
court
to
show
the
significance
that
they
attached
to
the
fact
that
missouri
had
refused
to
follow
illinois
in
this
respect.
i
think
that
goes
perhaps
to
this
question
of
significance
of
section
311
and
the
permissive
word
in
their
requirement,
because
here
is
missouri
affirmatively
refusing
to
provide
for
a
class
vote
on
mergers
and
consolidations
that
does
not
become
a
policy
of
the
state
in
missouri
to
have
class
votes.
now
they
come
to
270
and
they
say
that
270
they
must,
must
come
under
270
of
this
is
the
another
hurdle
they
have
to
overcome.
and
the
section
to
which
your
honor
referred
in
the
opinion
says
that
270
doesn’t
accomplish
the
purpose,
because
all
270
does
and
read
the
literal
language
of
it,
is
to
say
that
if
in
your
articles,
you
provide
for
a
greater
vote
than
that
provided
in
this
chapter.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
what
the
court
was
saying
and
to
really
construe
that
you
have
to
go
back
earlier
in
this
opinion
and
time
will
not
permit
me
to
do
it
here.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
to
go
to
the
questions
which
the
court
propounded
for
itself.
if
you
go
back,
the
petitioners
say
that
the
court
didn’t
overturn
the
district
court,
but
they
go
back
to
142
you
see
they
say
the
district
court
held
us
and
so
in
this
posture
it
comes
to
us.
we
reverse,
they
overturned
it
as
definitely
and
possibly
as
i
know
how.
then
the
court
undertook
to
go
through
the
process
of
reasoning
why
it
reversed
and
how
it
arrived
at
this
conclusion
of
reversing
the
district
court
and
in
the
course
of
doing
so
it
outlined
the
questions
which
were
presented
to
it
and
one
of
the
questions
that
this
particular
language
is
directed
to,
if
i
can
turn
to
it,
i
can’t
at
the
moment
turn
to
it,
but
we
find
before
that
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
court
phrased
these
three
questions
which
it
answered
on
page
157.
it
phrased
the
questions
which
were
presented
to
it,
it
certainly
had
doubts
about
it
they
are
difficult
questions,
but
i
submit
it
finally
resolved
and
what
petitioners
are
really
objecting
to
is
not
that
they
didn’t
resolve
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
alleghany
brief
says
that
they
finally
resolved
their
doubts.
they
are
objecting
to
the
reasoning
which
the
court
of
appeals
followed
in
resolving.
the
fact
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
the
national
law
and
the
national
policy
to
facilitate
mergers
and
said
we
are
going
to
resolve
these
doubts
in
a
way
which
is
going
to
facilitate
mergers
and
consolidations
not
put
hurdles
in
the
place
of
them,
we
leave
it
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
decide
whether
it
is
fair
and
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
he
makes
a
distinction.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
i
think
and
i
think
if
–
may,
i
answer
your
question
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
what
congress
was
doing
here.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
this
is
an
answer
i
may
to
the
question.
congress
was
differing
in
this
unless
a
different
vote
is
required
by
the
state
law
to
the
policy
as
expressed
by
the
law
of
the
state
as
embodied
in
the
statutes
of
the
state.
i
think
that
is
what
congress
was
differing
to
when
it
put
that
qualifying
language
in
the
statute
and
not
to
what
the
parties
might
do
by
private
contract
even
though
it
would
be
enforced
and
given
effect
to
by
the
courts
of
the
state.
now
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i’m
not
as
familiar
with
that
legislative
history
as
mr.
lyons
is
and
i
cannot
point
to
a
specific
sector.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
i
cannot
cite,
i
cannot
cite
legislative
history
in
congress,
but
i
can
say
that
in
doing
my
brief
a
decision
of
our
supreme
court
that
says
that
in
another
situation
where
they’re
talking
about
state
law,
their
main
state
statutory
law.
and
our
supreme
court
has
also
held
that
these
private
provisions
such
as
voting
rights,
although
it
wasn’t
that
in
articles
of
association
are
a
matter
of
private
contact
and
not
public
law
and
that
is
what
our
supreme
court
has
held
in
the
shapiro
case.
