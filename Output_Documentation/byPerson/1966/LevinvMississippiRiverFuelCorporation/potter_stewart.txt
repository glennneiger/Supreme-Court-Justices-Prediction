justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
in
the
new
company,
in
the
proposed
new
consolidated
company
--
each,
they’re
now
about
a
1,800,000
a
shares
outstanding,
about
40,000
b
shares
outstanding?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
and
each
is
going
to,
for
each
share
whether
it
would
be
an
a
share
or
b
share
they’re
going
to
get
the
same
number
of
shares,
but
is
it
four
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
each
one
with
the
–
of
a
one
class
stock,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
going
to
be
the
only
equity
security
in
the
new
formulated
corporation--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mcallister
i
take
it
that
question
would
perhaps
--
would
be
arguing
that
issue
if
you
didn’t
have
the
clause
unless
the
different
voters
required
under
applicable
state
law,
so
that
without
that
provision
a
majority
vote,
in
the
instance,
it
might
suggest,
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
then
the
constitutional
question
may
arise,
well
i
gather
what
you
are
doing
is
you
don’t
have
to
reach
that.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
statute
does
say
unless
the
different
vote
is
required
under
applicable
state
law
and
you
say
missouri
law
does
require
a
different
vote,
that
being
a
vote
by
classes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
what’s
your
position
is?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
i
do
hope
you
come
back
and
tell
me
what
we’re
supposed
to
do
if
this
gets
down
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
part
of
missouri
law
and
if
and
i
must
say
to
you
again
so
far
at
least
i
will
have
to
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
differing
with
the
district
court
to
what
is
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
we’ve
all
interrupted
you
in
a
very
big
deal,
and
i
apologize
for
doing
so
further
except
that
it
seems
evident
that
the
members
of
the
court
have
differing
views
or
impressions
as
to
this
case
and
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
mine
so
that
you
can
direct
your
argument
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
--
that
the
district
court
did
emphasize
and
decide
mainly
what
the
law
of
missouri
was.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
ultimately
said
we
really
don’t
need
to
decide
the
details
of
the
law
of
missouri
because
the
federal
statues
says
required
by
state
law
not
permitted
by
state
law
and
whatever
this
is,
this
is
just
what
the
law
of
missouri
permits,
whatever
it
is
rather
than
requires
and
therefore
we
are
construing
the
federal
statute
primarily
and
this
is
how
it
comes
out
--
i
am
just
telling
that’s
why
i
understand
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
during
the
course
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
aren’t
we
talking
meaning
of
the
federal
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
whether
this
is
required
by
state
law
or
whether
this
is
something
permitted
by
state
law,
i.e.,
what
is
the
meaning
of
511
those
words
of
section
511?
justice
potter
stewart
but
though
as
i
say,
we’ve
all
taken
too
much
of
time
i
don’t
want
to
take
any.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
as
these
stockholders
voted
in
favor
of
this
plan,
do
you
have
any
constitutional
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
by
virtue
of
their
class
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wouldn’t
explain
that
–
justice
potter
stewart
now
how
do
you
explain
the
language
on
the
top
of
page
157
of
the
record
as
to
the
--
that
seems
to
me
is
the
--
seems
to
me
and
i
guess
me
alone
as
the
key
to
court
of
appeals
reason
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
much
is
clear
isn’t
it
that
no
statute
of
missouri,
no
statute
of
missouri
requires
this
kind
of
a
class
vote
and
this
kind
of
a
consolidation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
please
just
so
we
can
see
it,
so
i
can
try
to
see
what
this
case
is
about,
is
there
any
general
statute
of
missouri
requiring
with
respect
to
railroad
corporations
or
corporations
generally
that
there
be
a
class
vote
in
this
kind
of
a
consolidation.
justice
potter
stewart
now
that
would
be
true
under
the
ordinary
law
of
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course.
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
going
to
uphold
your
corporate
charter.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
not
what
i
asked
you.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
don’t.
well,
i’ve
asked
you
twice,
but
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
any
statute
of
missouri
without
reference
to
what
a
corporate
charter
might
have,
whether
any
statute
of
missouri
says
that
in
case
of
the
consolidation
of
this
kind,
you
have
to
have
this
kind
of
a
class
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
the
missouri
statutes
say
we
are
going
to
uphold
we
are
going
to
permit
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
corporate
charter
to
say
what
it
wants
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
and
then
we
are
going
to
enforce
the
charter.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
the
missouri
law
is.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
actually
in
your
brief,
you
take
issue
with
at
least
two
of
those.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that,
that
would
be
an
outrageous
or
absurd
result?
i
think
the
law
of
good
many
state
requires
just
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i’m
just
wondering
if
court
of
appeals
has
d
said
that
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
that
--
those
question
suggested
by
mr.
justice
douglas’
questions
and
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
black,
those
issues,
those
issues
would
be
present
in
this
case
would
they
not?
whether
or
not
that
these
shares
had
any
voting
right
and
even
if
it
were
clear
that
the
b
shares
did
not
have
any
voting
rights,
still
the
a
shares
wouldn’t
be
allowed
to
steal
their
property.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
back
in
1954
when
the
commission
approved
these
charter
provisions?
justice
potter
stewart
pardon
me,
that’s
hardly
a
matter
of
missouri
law,
that’s
just
a
matter
of
reading
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
reading
the
language
--
justice
potter
stewart
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
court
of
appeals
deal
with
that
question.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
that
statement
of
157,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
i
gather
were
not
persuaded
to
pay,
if
mopac
articles
court
for
class
vote
were
consolidated
or
b,
that
if
they
do
–
that
is
if
the
articles
requires
class
vote
on
consolidation
351,270
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
its
reference
to
the
articles,
demands
class
vote,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
may
i
just
ask
a
(inaudible)
structure
of
this
sentence
--
it
is
susceptible
to
construction
that
even
though
articles
calls
for
a
class
vote,
370
by
its
reference
doesn’t
demand
it,
maybe
that
means
even
if
it
permits
it?
justice
potter
stewart
don’t
bother
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
right
ahead
of
that
in
our
view
the
class
b
shareholders
must
surmount
each
and
all
of
these
work
hurdles
in
order
to
prevail,
we
are
not
convinced
they’ve
surmounted
any
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
state?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
argument
about
the
--
about
the
right
to
a
class
vote
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
in
the
new
company,
in
the
proposed
new
consolidated
company
--
each,
they’re
now
about
a
1,800,000
a
shares
outstanding,
about
40,000
b
shares
outstanding?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
and
each
is
going
to,
for
each
share
whether
it
would
be
an
a
share
or
b
share
they’re
going
to
get
the
same
number
of
shares,
but
is
it
four
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
each
one
with
the
–
of
a
one
class
stock,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
going
to
be
the
only
equity
security
in
the
new
formulated
corporation--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mcallister
i

i

justice

because
the

does

you
say
missouri
law
does
require

a

by

justice

stewart
that
what’s
your
