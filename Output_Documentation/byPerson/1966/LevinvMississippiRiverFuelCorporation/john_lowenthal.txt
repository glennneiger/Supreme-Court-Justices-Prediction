mr.
john
lowenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
betty
levin
and
other
individual
class
b
stockholders.
there
are
just
mr.
justice
white
there
are
about
1,200
individual
class
b
stockholder
who
own
approximately
one
half
of
the
class
b
stock
the
other
half
being
owned
by
alleghany
corporation.
my
client
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
no
the
class
a
stock
went
to
the
old
preferred
stockholder,
several
years
after
that
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
standard
preferred
stock
and
the
class
a
is
likewise
the
standard
preferred
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
creditable
were
paid
off
in
full
and
the
old
preferred
stockholders
were
paid
off
in
full,
they
got
a
lot
of
new
-–
they
got
two-and-a-half
times
as
many
shares
of
new
preferred
stock
of
class
a
for
their
old
preferred
stock.
so
they
all
got
paid
in
full
and
what
was
left,
the
residual
earnings
went
to
the
class
b,
the
common
stockholders.
mr.
justice
black
suggests
what
seems
to
me
to
be
clearly
the
case,
that
where
the
preferred
stockholders
here
able
to
take
over
everything
that
belongs
to
the
common
stockholders,
the
class
b
merely
by
calling
it
a
plan
of
merger
or
consolidation,
it
clearly
would
be
unconstitutional
and
it
had
been
so
held.
i
find
one
lower
court
federal
case,
the
wood
case
which
flatly
held
that
if
one
class
of
stockholder
tries
to
do
that
to
another
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
and
it
cannot
be
done.
mr.
john
lowenthal
if
they
have
voted
in
favor
of
it
by
virtue
of
their
class
vote
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
no,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
lowenthal
i
quite
agree
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
to
the
defenders,
it
could
not
be
done
that
goes
too
far
if
the
vote,
the
hypothetical
vote
in
favor
of
the
plan
is
designed
to
deprive
a
minority
of
what
they
are
entitled
to,
then
the
wood
case
makes
perfectly
clear,
it’s
unconstitutional.
now
here
we
don’t
face
the
problem
because
the
charter
provision
for
class
voting
mr.
justice
black
which
was
imposed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
charter
provision
requires
a
class
vote
to
do
any
of
these
things.
now
obviously
the
common
stockholders,
the
class
b
are
not
going
to
consent
to
it,
they
won’t
vote
for
it,
so
it
can’t
be
done.
now
this
charter
imposed
by
the
commission
on
the
bankruptcy
ordinance
also
operates
under
missouri
law
in
view
of
the
provision
of
section
511
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
requires
the
observance
or
any
of
these
deals
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
requires
the
observance
of
whatever
vote
is
required
under
state
law.
now
this
federally
imposed
charter
for
class
voting
also
operates
and
is
valid
under
state
law.
there
is
absolutely
no
question
of
it
despite
the
fact
that
court
of
appeals
did
express
some
doubts
about
it.
i
don’t
read
the
decision
as
deciding
contrary
to
the
district
court’s
conclusion
that
there
is
a
class
voting
under
state
law.
mr.
john
lowenthal
no
sir
we
are
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaints
on
the
ground
that
we
have
no
class
vote.
the
district
court
held
against
them
dismissed
their
motions
or
overruled
their
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaints
and
asked
the
court,
district
court
to
certify
the
question.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes
sir.
mr.
john
lowenthal
your
honor
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
the
charter
does
not
require
a
class
vote
which
i
don’t
they
held,
they
would
be,
i
submit
dead
wrong
in
interpreting
that
charter
because
as
you
can
see
on
the
face
of
the
charter
it
says
any
change
of
class
rights
requires
a
class
vote
and
that’s
the
charter
that
the
commission
and
the
bankruptcy
court
imposed
in
this
plan
of
reorganization.
now
i
don’t
think
that
court
of
appeals
went
so
far
as
to
say
that.
i
think
they
expressed
doubts
and
went
over
and
said
we’ll
resolve
these
doubts
not
by
deciding
what
the
charter
says
and
not
by
deciding
what
state
law
gives
you,
we’ll
resolve
them
by
disregarding
the
state
law
entirely
and
going
to
the
majority
vote
that’s
set
out
in
section
511
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
which
applies
--
when
there
is
no
different
vote
under
state
law,
they
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
finessed
the
charter
and
the
state
law
questions
after
saying
that
they
though
the
vote
was
doubtful.
the
district
court
did
not
find
it
doubtful.
mr.
john
lowenthal
mr.
justice
stewart
if
the
--
i
think
the
court
is
saying
two
things,
it
is
saying
we
are
not
sure
what
the
charter
and
the
state
law
provide
and
because
we
are
not
sure
instead
of
following
the
district
court’s
conclusions
on
that
we
will
simply
disregard
it
entirely.
mr.
john
lowenthal
no
sir
that
is
not
clear
and
that
is
not
correct.
the
statutes
of
missouri
are
as
emphatic
as
any
state
statutes
are
in
requiring
a
class
vote
in
this
case.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes
sir
there
is.
section
351.055
requires
the
charter
to
set
forth
the
class
rights,
the
class
rights.
mopac’s
charter
sets
forth
the
class
rights
using
that
statutory
language
including
in
those
class
rights,
the
class
voting
rights.
another
missouri
statute
351.270
says
that
whenever
the
charter
sets
forth
a
class
voting
rights,
those
charter
requirements
shall
control.
mr.
john
lowenthal
of
course,
and
it’s
true
in
practically
every
state
union.
mr.
john
lowenthal
that
is
to
say
the
statutory
pattern
in
the
state
law
is
your
charter
may
upgrade
or
augment
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
of
course.
mr.
john
lowenthal
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
lowenthal
if
the
question
then
whether
that
is
a
required
vote
or
a
permitted
vote?
mr.
john
lowenthal
only
if
your
charter
so
requires
it
not
if
the
charter
is
silent.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes.
mr.
john
lowenthal
absolutely.
mr.
john
lowenthal
absolutely.
mr.
john
lowenthal
that’s
what
the
missouri
law
is.
the
missouri
law
say
if
your
charter
requires
a
class
vote
that’s
the
vote
required
for
consolidations
in
missouri.
mr.
john
lowenthal
and
that’s
what
the
charter
here
did
pursuant
to
the
commission
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
that
becomes
the
vote
required
under
missouri
law.
now
this
has
been
decided
before,
and
there
is
no
problem
about
a
charter
vote,
once
you
put
it
in
your
charter,
class
voting,
being
the
vote
required
under
state
law.
the
fact
that
your
charter
may
or
may
not
do
it,
cuts
no
ice
once
the
charter
has
done
it.
once
it’s
in
there
the
state
law
says
that’s
controlling,
that’s
the
vote
required.
now
there
is
an
absolutely
straightforward
interpretation
of
this
exact
charter
under
missouri
law.
just
two
years
before
this
litigation
began,
mopac
went
before
the
commission
and
insisted
that
the
class
b
stockholders
have
the
right
to
a
class
vote
on
mergers
and
consolidations
of
mopac.
they
flatly
stated
that
and
the
reason
they
did
it
was
this.
mopac
was
then
holding
merger
discussion
with
other
railroads.
alleghany
corporation
came
before
the
commission
and
said
let
us
out
of
our
voting
trust,
we
want
the
direct
class
vote
on
these
mergers,
it’s
too
important
to
have
it
through
a
trustee,
and
mopac
opposed
and
said
no,
because
they
have
that
class
voting
right
on
mergers
of
mopac.
same
charter,
same
federal
statute,
same
missouri
state
law
because
they
have
that
class
voting
right,
keep
it
with
the
trustee,
mopac
won
that
case.
the
commission
denied
alleghany’s
request.
now,
they’re
in
here
the
other
way
around,
and
telling
you
exactly
the
opposite
that
the
class
b
does
not
have
a
class
voting
right.
i
submit
that’s
going
too
far
and
the
courts
don’t
take
to
it
either,
they
call
it
double-dealing
the
administration
of
justice.
they’re
arguing
both
sides
of
the
principle
issue.
they
took
the
advantage
and
won
by
insisting
on
mopac’s
class
voting
right,
just
a
few
years
ago.
now,
they
come
in
here
and
tell
you,
just
the
other
way
around.
now,
with
this
plan
of
bankruptcy
reorganization
that
imposed
the
class
voting
requirement
in
the
charter,
that
was
the
deal,
without
that
class
voting
right,
there
would
have
been
no
deal
because
the
common
stockholders
have
nothing
without
that
class
voting
right
to
protect
themselves.
if
they
didn’t
have
it,
they
could
unconstitutional
or
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
swamp
them,
to
take
everything
away
from
them
just
because
the
preferred
stock
has
so
many
more
votes.
mr.
john
lowenthal
the
same
thing
mr.
justice
black.
the
statutes
in
missouri
require
that
the
charter
provision
control
the
vote
and
a
recapitalization
that
would
change
the
class
right.
mr.
john
lowenthal
absolutely
because
the
charter
requires
the
class
vote
for
any
change
of
class
rights.
mr.
john
lowenthal
absolutely.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes.
mr.
john
lowenthal
it
could
not
happen
constitutionally.
mr.
john
lowenthal
if
the
court
of
appeals
construed
missouri
law
to
deny
the
class
vote
it
could
happen,
yes.
but
i
don’t
so
read
the
missouri
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
court
of
appeals
decision.
i
don’t
think
it
can
possibly
dispute
the
class
voting
right
under
the
missouri
law.
may
i
reserve
my
time
on
that?
mr.
john
lowenthal
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
draw
your
attention
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
this
problem
that’s
required
on
page
8
of
my
reply
brief,
that
buff
colored
job,
number
352
on
page
8.
i
quote
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
can
see
no
difference
for
purposes
of
section
5(11),
between
a
statutory
provision
for
a
class
vote
and
a
charter
provision
for
it
pursuant
to
statutory
authority.
mr.
john
lowenthal
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
mr.
john
lowenthal
your
honor
i
don’t
know,
the
best
that
i
can
make
out
of
it
is
that,
they
--
mr.
john
lowenthal

of
my
replied
brief,
your
honor
the
buff
job
in
number
352.
mr.
john
lowenthal
156
in
the
record
thanks,
justice
douglas.
mr.
justice
while
i
am
not
sure,
they
did
go
on
to
express
doubt,
but
what
seems
to
me
what
they
did
is
this,
they
said
we
will
resolve
these
doubts
not
by
deciding
these
questions,
but
by
disregarding
all
state
law
and
going
instead
to
the
majority
of
vote
provision
in
section
5(11)
will
simply
override
or
ignore
these
doubtful
state
law
matters
or
what
they
thought
were
doubtful
state
law
questions.
they
are
so
full
of
doubt
that
we
won’t
say
anything
at
all
about
them,
we
will
simply
look.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
your
honor
but
if
that
had
been
what
they
held,
they
would
then
have
held
that
the
required
vote
in
missouri
is
a
two-thirds
vote
for
mergers,
but
they
did
not
so
hold.
they
held
instead
that
the
vote
here
should
be
the
majority
vote
under
the
federal
statute
section
5(11),
so
they
disregarded
whatever
the
state,
whatever
they
thought
the
state
law
to
be
and
went
instead
to
section
5(11)
disregarding
the
congressional
mandate
to
observe
the
state’s
voting
requirements.
mr.
john
lowenthal
i
don’t
see
that
they
ruled
on
it,
your
honor.
they
said
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
but
right
before
that
they
said
what
i
have
just
quoted
about
they
see
no
difference,
if
the
charter
requires
it
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
which
makes
the
charter
provision
controlling
so
i
am
not
sure
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
your
honor.
when
they
say
that
they
see
no
difference
if
the
charter
does
it,
then
it
would
seem
from
their
language
i
quoted
to
be
the
vote
that
has
become
required
by
reason
of
the
state
statute
that
authorizes
the
charter
to
do
that.
now
that’s
the
most
i
can
get
out
of
it,
but
i
want
to
mention
this
your
honor,
it
has
until
now
been
the
consistent
practice
of
the
commission
and
the
carriers
and
of
mopac
itself
to
observe
a
charter
requirement
for
class
voting
on
mergers.
last
week,
this
court
unanimously
affirmed
mopac’s
bid
for
control
in
the
chicago
and
eastern
illinois
railroad,
last
week.
now
mopac’s
success
in
that
case
rested
squarely
on
mopac’s
right
to
a
class
vote
under
the
charter
of
the
chicago
and
eastern
illinois
railroad.
mr.
john
lowenthal
indiana,
with
state
law
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
missouri
state
law
and
the
charter
of
chicago
and
eastern
illinois
railroad
just
like
mopac’s
charter
came
out
of
a
bankruptcy
organization,
it
provides
a
class
vote
on
mergers
for
a
small
class
of
the
preferred
stock
and
mopac
bought
just
enough
of
that
preferred
stock
to
block
other
roads
from
merging
with
cni
and
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
your
honor,
mopac
and
mississippi
river
fuel
both
respondents
here
were
parties
before
the
commission
in
that
preceding
that
you
affirmed
last
week.
they
asserted
that
right
and
the
commission
agreed
with
it,
the
commission
said
of
that
class
voting
right
for
mergers
based
on
the
cni
charter,
commission
said
missouri
pacific
clearly
possessed
the
power
to
block
stockholder
assent
to
mergers
and
thus
prevent
cni
from
accomplishing
mergers
and
consolidations.
i
refer
to
this
again
this
reply
brief
at
page
4,
foot
note
3;
i
just
managed
to
get
it
in
after
you
affirmed
it
last
week.
now,
this
is
correct,
it
has
been
the
consistent
practice
of
the
commission
and
the
carriers,
that
for
any
merger
under
the
act,
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
charter
provisions
whether
for
class
voting
or
not.
charter
provisions
will
be
observed
and
if
under
state
law
the
charter
provision
for
class
voting
sets
the
vote
that
state
law
chose
you,
you
must
observe
for
your
stockholders
that
has
been
the
vote
that
the
commission
and
the
carriers
have
always
(inaudible)
question
observed.
mr.
john
lowenthal
your
honor,
this
is,
this
voting
question
is
not
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
under
the
commission,
and
i
have
noted
by
the
way
in
my
principle
brief.
mr.
john
lowenthal
it’s
within
its
jurisdiction,
but
not
primary.
the
reason
we
didn’t
wait
is
if
we
have
a
class
vote,
clearly
we
are
not
going
to
vote
for
this
plan
which
confiscates
all
our
rights
so
that
would
obviate
many
years
of
commission
proceedings
on
the
plan,
the
respondents
agreed
with
this
approach,
but
settled
the
voting
issue
first
so
we
don’t
have
to
go
through
long
commission
proceedings.
the
voting
issue
not
being
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
as
i
had
indicated
in
my
principle
brief,
i
think
it’s
page
4
footnote.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
lowenthal
it’s
in
my
brief,
so
all
agreed
since
this
is
not
within
the
primary
jurisdiction,
let’s
get
it
over
with
and
not
first
go
through
years
of
commission
proceedings
and
we
are
not
for
this,
this
entire
case
on
the
respondents’
position
would
make
a
dead
letter
of
the
bankruptcy
act
because
this
charter
provision
just
like
cni’s
charter
provision
came
in
under
the
bankruptcy
act
and
a
plan
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
no,
sir
it
was
not
--
mr.
john
lowenthal

to
14
of
my
reply
brief
and
number
352
for
the
missouri
statutes
which
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
it
has
always
been
the
practice
in
missouri
that
charter
provisions
incorporate
charters
for
class
voting
will
always
be
observed
and
required.
mr.
john
lowenthal
even
in
railroad
reorganizations
and
missouri
pacific
itself
had
such
a
class
voting
provision
in
it’s
old
charter
of
1917.
i
refer
to
that
likewise
in
my
replied
brief.
there
is
no
question,
but
what
under
missouri
state
law
class
voting
provisions
in
charters.
mr.
john
lowenthal
mostly
they
were
not
--
both
lower
courts
held
that
they
were
chapter
351,
the
general
business
statutes.
mr.
john
lowenthal
even
before
61
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
date
of
61.
i
think
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
thank
you.
very
well.
mr.
john
lowenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
betty
levin
and
other
individual
class
b
stockholders.
there
are
just
mr.
justice
white
there
are
about
1,200
individual
class
b
stockholder
who
own
approximately
one
half
of
the
class
b
stock
the
other
half
being
owned
by
alleghany
corporation.
my
client
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
no
the
class
a
stock
went
to
the
old
preferred
stockholder,
several
years
after
that
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
standard
preferred
stock
and
the
class
a
is
likewise
the
standard
preferred
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
creditable
were
paid
off
in
full
and
the
old
preferred
stockholders
were
paid
off
in
full,
they
got
a
lot
of
new
-–
they
got
two-and-a-half
times
as
many
shares
of
new
preferred
stock
of
class
a
for
their
old
preferred
stock.
so
they
all
got
paid
in
full
and
what
was
left,
the
residual
earnings
went
to
the
class
b,
the
common
stockholders.
mr.
justice
black
suggests
what
seems
to
me
to
be
clearly
the
case,
that
where
the
preferred
stockholders
here
able
to
take
over
everything
that
belongs
to
the
common
stockholders,
the
class
b
merely
by
calling
it
a
plan
of
merger
or
consolidation,
it
clearly
would
be
unconstitutional
and
it
had
been
so
held.
i
find
one
lower
court
federal
case,
the
wood
case
which
flatly
held
that
if
one
class
of
stockholder
tries
to
do
that
to
another
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
and
it
cannot
be
done.
mr.
john
lowenthal
if
they
have
voted
in
favor
of
it
by
virtue
of
their
class
vote
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
no,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
lowenthal
i
quite
agree
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
to
the
defenders,
it
could
not
be
done
that
goes
too
far
if
the
vote,
the
hypothetical
vote
in
favor
of
the
plan
is
designed
to
deprive
a
minority
of
what
they
are
entitled
to,
then
the
wood
case
makes
perfectly
clear,
it’s
unconstitutional.
now
here
we
don’t
face
the
problem
because
the
charter
provision
for
class
voting
mr.
justice
black
which
was
imposed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
charter
provision
requires
a
class
vote
to
do
any
of
these
things.
now
obviously
the
common
stockholders,
the
class
b
are
not
going
to
consent
to
it,
they
won’t
vote
for
it,
so
it
can’t
be
done.
now
this
charter
imposed
by
the
commission
on
the
bankruptcy
ordinance
also
operates
under
missouri
law
in
view
of
the
provision
of
section
511
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
requires
the
observance
or
any
of
these
deals
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
requires
the
observance
of
whatever
vote
is
required
under
state
law.
now
this
federally
imposed
charter
for
class
voting
also
operates
and
is
valid
under
state
law.
there
is
absolutely
no
question
of
it
despite
the
fact
that
court
of
appeals
did
express
some
doubts
about
it.
i
don’t
read
the
decision
as
deciding
contrary
to
the
district
court’s
conclusion
that
there
is
a
class
voting
under
state
law.
mr.
john
lowenthal
no
sir
we
are
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaints
on
the
ground
that
we
have
no
class
vote.
the
district
court
held
against
them
dismissed
their
motions
or
overruled
their
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaints
and
asked
the
court,
district
court
to
certify
the
question.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes
sir.
mr.
john
lowenthal
your
honor
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
the
charter
does
not
require
a
class
vote
which
i
don’t
they
held,
they
would
be,
i
submit
dead
wrong
in
interpreting
that
charter
because
as
you
can
see
on
the
face
of
the
charter
it
says
any
change
of
class
rights
requires
a
class
vote
and
that’s
the
charter
that
the
commission
and
the
bankruptcy
court
imposed
in
this
plan
of
reorganization.
now
i
don’t
think
that
court
of
appeals
went
so
far
as
to
say
that.
i
think
they
expressed
doubts
and
went
over
and
said
we’ll
resolve
these
doubts
not
by
deciding
what
the
charter
says
and
not
by
deciding
what
state
law
gives
you,
we’ll
resolve
them
by
disregarding
the
state
law
entirely
and
going
to
the
majority
vote
that’s
set
out
in
section
511
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
which
applies
--
when
there
is
no
different
vote
under
state
law,
they
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
finessed
the
charter
and
the
state
law
questions
after
saying
that
they
though
the
vote
was
doubtful.
the
district
court
did
not
find
it
doubtful.
mr.
john
lowenthal
mr.
justice
stewart
if
the
--
i
think
the
court
is
saying
two
things,
it
is
saying
we
are
not
sure
what
the
charter
and
the
state
law
provide
and
because
we
are
not
sure
instead
of
following
the
district
court’s
conclusions
on
that
we
will
simply
disregard
it
entirely.
mr.
john
lowenthal
no
sir
that
is
not
clear
and
that
is
not
correct.
the
statutes
of
missouri
are
as
emphatic
as
any
state
statutes
are
in
requiring
a
class
vote
in
this
case.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes
sir
there
is.
section
351.055
requires
the
charter
to
set
forth
the
class
rights,
the
class
rights.
mopac’s
charter
sets
forth
the
class
rights
using
that
statutory
language
including
in
those
class
rights,
the
class
voting
rights.
another
missouri
statute
351.270
says
that
whenever
the
charter
sets
forth
a
class
voting
rights,
those
charter
requirements
shall
control.
mr.
john
lowenthal
of
course,
and
it’s
true
in
practically
every
state
union.
mr.
john
lowenthal
that
is
to
say
the
statutory
pattern
in
the
state
law
is
your
charter
may
upgrade
or
augment
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
of
course.
mr.
john
lowenthal
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
lowenthal
if
the
question
then
whether
that
is
a
required
vote
or
a
permitted
vote?
mr.
john
lowenthal
only
if
your
charter
so
requires
it
not
if
the
charter
is
silent.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes.
mr.
john
lowenthal
absolutely.
mr.
john
lowenthal
absolutely.
mr.
john
lowenthal
that’s
what
the
missouri
law
is.
the
missouri
law
say
if
your
charter
requires
a
class
vote
that’s
the
vote
required
for
consolidations
in
missouri.
mr.
john
lowenthal
and
that’s
what
the
charter
here
did
pursuant
to
the
commission
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
that
becomes
the
vote
required
under
missouri
law.
now
this
has
been
decided
before,
and
there
is
no
problem
about
a
charter
vote,
once
you
put
it
in
your
charter,
class
voting,
being
the
vote
required
under
state
law.
the
fact
that
your
charter
may
or
may
not
do
it,
cuts
no
ice
once
the
charter
has
done
it.
once
it’s
in
there
the
state
law
says
that’s
controlling,
that’s
the
vote
required.
now
there
is
an
absolutely
straightforward
interpretation
of
this
exact
charter
under
missouri
law.
just
two
years
before
this
litigation
began,
mopac
went
before
the
commission
and
insisted
that
the
class
b
stockholders
have
the
right
to
a
class
vote
on
mergers
and
consolidations
of
mopac.
they
flatly
stated
that
and
the
reason
they
did
it
was
this.
mopac
was
then
holding
merger
discussion
with
other
railroads.
alleghany
corporation
came
before
the
commission
and
said
let
us
out
of
our
voting
trust,
we
want
the
direct
class
vote
on
these
mergers,
it’s
too
important
to
have
it
through
a
trustee,
and
mopac
opposed
and
said
no,
because
they
have
that
class
voting
right
on
mergers
of
mopac.
same
charter,
same
federal
statute,
same
missouri
state
law
because
they
have
that
class
voting
right,
keep
it
with
the
trustee,
mopac
won
that
case.
the
commission
denied
alleghany’s
request.
now,
they’re
in
here
the
other
way
around,
and
telling
you
exactly
the
opposite
that
the
class
b
does
not
have
a
class
voting
right.
i
submit
that’s
going
too
far
and
the
courts
don’t
take
to
it
either,
they
call
it
double-dealing
the
administration
of
justice.
they’re
arguing
both
sides
of
the
principle
issue.
they
took
the
advantage
and
won
by
insisting
on
mopac’s
class
voting
right,
just
a
few
years
ago.
now,
they
come
in
here
and
tell
you,
just
the
other
way
around.
now,
with
this
plan
of
bankruptcy
reorganization
that
imposed
the
class
voting
requirement
in
the
charter,
that
was
the
deal,
without
that
class
voting
right,
there
would
have
been
no
deal
because
the
common
stockholders
have
nothing
without
that
class
voting
right
to
protect
themselves.
if
they
didn’t
have
it,
they
could
unconstitutional
or
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
swamp
them,
to
take
everything
away
from
them
just
because
the
preferred
stock
has
so
many
more
votes.
mr.
john
lowenthal
the
same
thing
mr.
justice
black.
the
statutes
in
missouri
require
that
the
charter
provision
control
the
vote
and
a
recapitalization
that
would
change
the
class
right.
mr.
john
lowenthal
absolutely
because
the
charter
requires
the
class
vote
for
any
change
of
class
rights.
mr.
john
lowenthal
absolutely.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes.
mr.
john
lowenthal
it
could
not
happen
constitutionally.
mr.
john
lowenthal
if
the
court
of
appeals
construed
missouri
law
to
deny
the
class
vote
it
could
happen,
yes.
but
i
don’t
so
read
the
missouri
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
court
of
appeals
decision.
i
don’t
think
it
can
possibly
dispute
the
class
voting
right
under
the
missouri
law.
may
i
reserve
my
time
on
that?
mr.
john
lowenthal
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
draw
your
attention
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
this
problem
that’s
required
on
page
8
of
my
reply
brief,
that
buff
colored
job,
number
352
on
page
8.
i
quote
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
can
see
no
difference
for
purposes
of
section
5(11),
between
a
statutory
provision
for
a
class
vote
and
a
charter
provision
for
it
pursuant
to
statutory
authority.
mr.
john
lowenthal
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
mr.
john
lowenthal
your
honor
i
don’t
know,
the
best
that
i
can
make
out
of
it
is
that,
they
--
mr.
john

my
replied
brief,
your
honor
the
buff
job
in
number
352.
mr.
john
lowenthal
156
in
the
record
thanks,
justice
douglas.
mr.
justice
while
i
am
not
sure,
they
did
go
on
to
express
doubt,
but
what
seems
to
me
what
they
did
is
this,
they
said
we
will
resolve
these
doubts
not
by
deciding
these
questions,
but
by
disregarding
all
state
law
and
going
instead
to
the
majority
of
vote
provision
in
section
5(11)
will
simply
override
or
ignore
these
doubtful
state
law
matters
or
what
they
thought
were
doubtful
state
law
questions.
they
are
so
full
of
doubt
that
we
won’t
say
anything
at
all
about
them,
we
will
simply
look.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
your
honor
but
if
that
had
been
what
they
held,
they
would
then
have
held
that
the
required
vote
in
missouri
is
a
two-thirds
vote
for
mergers,
but
they
did
not
so
hold.
they
held
instead
that
the
vote
here
should
be
the
majority
vote
under
the
federal
statute
section
5(11),
so
they
disregarded
whatever
the
state,
whatever
they
thought
the
state
law
to
be
and
went
instead
to
section
5(11)
disregarding
the
congressional
mandate
to
observe
the
state’s
voting
requirements.
mr.
john
lowenthal
i
don’t
see
that
they
ruled
on
it,
your
honor.
they
said
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
but
right
before
that
they
said
what
i
have
just
quoted
about
they
see
no
difference,
if
the
charter
requires
it
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
which
makes
the
charter
provision
controlling
so
i
am
not
sure
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
your
honor.
when
they
say
that
they
see
no
difference
if
the
charter
does
it,
then
it
would
seem
from
their
language
i
quoted
to
be
the
vote
that
has
become
required
by
reason
of
the
state
statute
that
authorizes
the
charter
to
do
that.
now
that’s
the
most
i
can
get
out
of
it,
but
i
want
to
mention
this
your
honor,
it
has
until
now
been
the
consistent
practice
of
the
commission
and
the
carriers
and
of
mopac
itself
to
observe
a
charter
requirement
for
class
voting
on
mergers.
last
week,
this
court
unanimously
affirmed
mopac’s
bid
for
control
in
the
chicago
and
eastern
illinois
railroad,
last
week.
now
mopac’s
success
in
that
case
rested
squarely
on
mopac’s
right
to
a
class
vote
under
the
charter
of
the
chicago
and
eastern
illinois
railroad.
mr.
john
lowenthal
indiana,
with
state
law
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
missouri
state
law
and
the
charter
of
chicago
and
eastern
illinois
railroad
just
like
mopac’s
charter
came
out
of
a
bankruptcy
organization,
it
provides
a
class
vote
on
mergers
for
a
small
class
of
the
preferred
stock
and
mopac
bought
just
enough
of
that
preferred
stock
to
block
other
roads
from
merging
with
cni
and
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
your
honor,
mopac
and
mississippi
river
fuel
both
respondents
here
were
parties
before
the
commission
in
that
preceding
that
you
affirmed
last
week.
they
asserted
that
right
and
the
commission
agreed
with
it,
the
commission
said
of
that
class
voting
right
for
mergers
based
on
the
cni
charter,
commission
said
missouri
pacific
clearly
possessed
the
power
to
block
stockholder
assent
to
mergers
and
thus
prevent
cni
from
accomplishing
mergers
and
consolidations.
i
refer
to
this
again
this
reply
brief
at
page
4,
foot
note
3;
i
just
managed
to
get
it
in
after
you
affirmed
it
last
week.
now,
this
is
correct,
it
has
been
the
consistent
practice
of
the
commission
and
the
carriers,
that
for
any
merger
under
the
act,
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
charter
provisions
whether
for
class
voting
or
not.
charter
provisions
will
be
observed
and
if
under
state
law
the
charter
provision
for
class
voting
sets
the
vote
that
state
law
chose
you,
you
must
observe
for
your
stockholders
that
has
been
the
vote
that
the
commission
and
the
carriers
have
always
(inaudible)
question
observed.
mr.
john
lowenthal
your
honor,
this
is,
this
voting
question
is
not
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
under
the
commission,
and
i
have
noted
by
the
way
in
my
principle
brief.
mr.
john
lowenthal
it’s
within
its
jurisdiction,
but
not
primary.
the
reason
we
didn’t
wait
is
if
we
have
a
class
vote,
clearly
we
are
not
going
to
vote
for
this
plan
which
confiscates
all
our
rights
so
that
would
obviate
many
years
of
commission
proceedings
on
the
plan,
the
respondents
agreed
with
this
approach,
but
settled
the
voting
issue
first
so
we
don’t
have
to
go
through
long
commission
proceedings.
the
voting
issue
not
being
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
as
i
had
indicated
in
my
principle
brief,
i
think
it’s
page
4
footnote.
mr.
john
lowenthal
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
lowenthal
it’s
in
my
brief,
so
all
agreed
since
this
is
not
within
the
primary
jurisdiction,
let’s
get
it
over
with
and
not
first
go
through
years
of
commission
proceedings
and
we
are
not
for
this,
this
entire
case
on
the
respondents’
position
would
make
a
dead
letter
of
the
bankruptcy
act
because
this
charter
provision
just
like
cni’s
charter
provision
came
in
under
the
bankruptcy
act
and
a
plan
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
no,
sir
it
was
not
--
mr.
john
lowenthal
no,
sir
may
i
please
refer
you
to
pages
12
to
14
of
my
reply
brief
and
number
352
for
the
missouri
statutes
which
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
it
has
always
been
the
practice
in
missouri
that
charter
provisions
incorporate
charters
for
class
voting
will
always
be
observed
and
required.
mr.
john
lowenthal
even
in
railroad
reorganizations
and
missouri
pacific
itself
had
such
a
class
voting
provision
in
it’s
old
charter
of
1917.
i
refer
to
that
likewise
in
my
replied
brief.
there
is
no
question,
but
what
under
missouri
state
law
class
voting
provisions
in
charters.
mr.
john
lowenthal
mostly
they
were
not
--
both
lower
courts
held
that
they
were
chapter
351,
the
general
business
statutes.
mr.
john
lowenthal
even
before
61
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
date
of
61.
i
think
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
thank
you.
very
well.
