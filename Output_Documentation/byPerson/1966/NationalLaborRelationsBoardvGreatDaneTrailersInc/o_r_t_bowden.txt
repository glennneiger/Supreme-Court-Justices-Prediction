mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
in
this
case
to
take
a
few
moments
to
lay
out
may
be
a
little
more
detail
the
background
of
the
case
so
that
we
can
see
this,
these
facts
as
they
actually
existed
at
that
time.
now,
this
company
had
dealt
with
this
union
from
a
period
of
more
than
20
years.
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
problems,
any
unfair
labor
practices
and
the
only
thing
we
can
assume
is
that
company
and
the
union
throughout
these
years
had
adjusted
their
problems
among
themselves.
in
this
case
itself,
there's
no
finding
of
any
independent
unfair
labor
practices
to
cloud
the
issue.
so
we
have
in
this
case
a
sterile
labor
atmosphere
other
than
this
one
incident
and
we
have
the
laboratory
conditions
that
the
board
strives
to
get
when
they
consider
a
case.
it's
been
our
view,
since
this
case
originated,
that
this
is
a
primarily
a
suit
for
money.
it
stood
by
the
board
as
the
improper
forum
to
do
this.
we
urged
from
the
beginning
that
if
they
felt
that
this
vacation
money
was
due
to
these
employees
that
the
proper
forum
was
to
the
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
which
is
set
out
for
this
purpose
to
test
rights
under
contract.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
it's
--
it's
--
we
probably
would,
your
honor
but
if
there's
a
question
and
we
recognize
there's
a
question
and
we
pointed
this
out
to
the
union
in
our
letter
to
them
that
since
there
was
a
question
that
we
thought
it
was
a
matter
which
should
be
resolved
through
negotiation
as
to
what
those
rights
might
be
to
try
the
one,
answer
the
301
suit
and
two,
to
not
cause
this
action
to
arise
and
it
may
be
well
remembered
that
the
union
would
not
even
discuss
this
matter
at
the
bargaining
table
even
though
there
were
bargaining
sessions
being
held
throughout
this
period
of
time.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
i
think
we're
all
from
the
premise
that
we
pay
it
out
in
the
contract.
it's
always
been
our
position
that
we
made
no
payment
for
vacation
under
this
contract.
the
only
vacation
policy
under
which
anyone
got
any
vacation
pay
was
that
promulgated
in
august
and
only
concerned
employees
of
the
plan
at
that
time.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
because
of
this
qualifying
which
this
plan
adopted.
they
had
to
be
employees
as
of
july
1st
and
if
they
were
not
employees
after
july
1st,
they
did
not
receive
any
vacation
pay.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
sir,
it
was
not
here
--
here
is
the
practical
problem
that
you
have
in
this
such
question.
you
have
a
group
of
employees
who
went
on
a
strike
and
a
group
who
did
not.
so,
the
union
cancelled
the
contract
under
which
there
are
certain
vacation
benefits
that
they
had
earned
because
of
the
service.
they
met
all
the
qualifications
under
the
union
contract
and
under
the
expired
or
cancelled
contract.
so
you
drop
to
this
time,
we
at
this
time
was
asking
the
union,
let's
negotiate
about
this
matter
and
say
who
is
entitled
to
vacation,
who
is
not.
and
the
only
thing
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
sir.
because
during
this
period
of
time,
and
even
before
july
1st,
the
union
had
lost
his
majority
status
numerically
and
even
though
we
continued
to
negotiate,
there
was
a
petition
filed
in
december
by
the
company
and
to
determine
whether
the
union
still
represented
the
employees
and
the
union
filed
a
disclaimer
of
any
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
there's
none.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
now,
there's
other
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i
would
say,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
your
honor,
the
question
was,
had
they
qualified
under
the
agreement,
and
this
was
the
problem
that
we
tried
to
get
the
union
to
the
bargain
table
to
discuss,
this
is
the
problem
that
we
advised
their
attorney
about
by
letter
in
july
that
there
was
a
question
in
my
mind
where
they
had
any
rights
under
that
agreement.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
sir.
they
--
as
my
understanding,
the
labor
board
cannot
--
is
not
in
the
business
and
were
not
set
up
to
construe
labor
contracts,
that
section
301
of
the
act
itself
is
set
up
to
determine
these
problems.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i
don't
think
they
would
as
an
independent
isolated
matter,
i'd
say
no.
but
they
had
--
they
could
go
in
the
state
court,
federal
court
and
conceivably
under
section
301
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
contract.
you
have
to
understand,
your
honor,
that
here
we
have
a
contract
cancelled
on
may
16
by
the
union.
it's
our
position
that
we
had
no
agreement
of
any
kind
when
they
cancelled.
now,
the
board
argued
that
they
have
some
vested
rights
or
interest
but
the
cases
go
both
ways.
this
have
much
vested
these
rights
have.
so
we
say
and
took
position
with
the
board
that
these
rights
are
not
so
fixed
that
we
think
there's
some
question
to
whether
we
are
required
to
pay.
so
from
the
period
of
may
16
until
august
the
15th,
there
was
no
vacation
policy.
now,
during
this
period
of
time
and
the
record
show
that
by
july
the
1st,
which
was
only
six
weeks
after
the
strike
started,
over
75%
of
the
employees
who
went
on
strike
had
been
replaced.
now,
these
employees
had
no
reinstatement
rights
or
they
had
no
employee
rights
after
that
time.
and
this
was
six
weeks
before
the
vacation
plan
was
instituted.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
your
honor
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
--
it's
going
to
depend
on
what
position
of
the
party.
well,
let's
say
that
they
--
they
said
that
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i
would
say
no.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
they
have
the
relief
be
that
if
they
had
to
violate
contract,
they
would
have
relief
to
the
greatest
procedure
and
the
other
function
there.
i
think
that
independent
to
that,
they
can
bring
a
suit
for
these
wages
but
this
is
where
there's
no
question
about
them
being
due
to
wages.
and
that
is
where
our
case
is
different
to
as
a
genuine
dispute
between
the
company
and
the
union
in
this
case
that
these
people
were
entitled
any
vacation
pay.
but
i
think
again,
we
have
to
keep
this
in
mind
that
by
august
the
1st
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
was
the
exact
question.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir
and
if
you
refuse
to
pay
vacation
wages
to
all
or
some.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
but
are
you
referring
to,
a
refusal
to
pay
any
wages
or
part
wages
and
part
--
they
did
not
pay?
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i'm
speaking
now
that
when
you
say
all
or
part,
you
mean
that
some
of
the
striker
or
some
of
the
employees
received
while
some
did
not
receive.
i
think
that
in
that
case,
there
would
be
the
basis
for
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
right.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i
agree
with
you.
now,
before
this,
i
think
we
have
to
take
this
a
step
further.
now,
before
this
vacation
plan
was
instituted
around
the
middle
of
august,
325
out
of
the
348
strikers
had
been
replaced.
so
you
have
a
--
you
have
only
23
unrep
--
have
not
been
replaced
at
the
time
the
vacation
plan
was
instituted.
now,
how
can
the
board
say
that
the
institution
of
this
vacation
plan
at
this
time
called
these
people
who
had
been
replaced
and
had
no
re-employment
rights
to
lose
their
interest
in
the
union
as
they
represented
in
this
plan.
now,
keeping
in
mind
too
that
this
vacation
plan
unlike
erie
did
not
attract
anybody
to
leave
the
strike
and
join
the
company
because
it
had
a
retroactive
effective
date,
which
mean
that
after
they
heard
the
plan
and
went
to
work,
that
they
wouldn't
be
affected
by
the
plan
at
all.
so
this
is
not
like
erie
at
all,
the
facts
or
situation
of
this
case.
this
is
not
made
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
people
to
break
the
strike.
they
come
in
because
they
had
already
been
replaced
or
returned
prior
to
any
effective
time
of
the
strike.
now,
vacation
plans
are
not
like
super
seniority
plans.
this
is
an
unusual
--
the
super
seniority
was
unusual
remedy
that
the
company
used.
vacation
plans
were
accepted
and
they
were
facet
of
employer-employee
relationship
whether
you
have
a
union
or
not.
so
that
all
the
company
did
in
this
instance
was
to
put
in
the
same
vacation
plan
in
august
that
they
have
offered
the
union
and
had
been
rejected
by
which
the
board
will
concede
we
had
a
right
to
do
with
any,
during
the
bargain,
at
any
offer
that
we
made
the
union
in
a
way
of
a
benefit,
wage
and
hours
that
we
have
a
right
have
a
new
bias
and
during
the
strike
to
institute
those.
now,
let's
assume
that
we
had
made
20-cent
an
hour
increase.we
could
have
put
that
into
the
nonstrikers
until
the
replacements
and
this
to
me
is
this
is
just
discriminatory
against
the
strikers
as
such
as
this
vacation
plan.
yet
this
is
accepted
and
the
board
will
not
use
this
as
a
basis
of
a
discriminatory
charge.
we've
put
in
the
charge
plan,
that's
been
offered,
and
the
union
rejected.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
if
they
qualify
it
again
under
whatever
this
plan
was.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
alright,
sir.
now,
the
--
as
been
stated
here,
this
matter
was
suggested
to
the
union
as
a
matter
of
the
vacation
pay
on
the
expired
contract
or
cancelled
contract
should
be
discussed
and
as
the
record
shows,
there
is
no
record
that
the
union
ever
discussed
it
or
brought
the
matter
up
again.
now,
from
the
above,
the
board
found
that
we
agree
with
the
trial
examiners
that
the
denial
of
vacation
pay
to
strikers
who
had
not
abandoned
the
strike
by
july
1st,
1963
unlawfully
discriminate
against
them
because
of
their
errands
to
union
strike.
now,
we're
talking
about
they're
making
it
as
option
in
the
face
of
a
plan
which
did
not
come
into
effect
for
six
weeks
after
this
and
at
which
time,
more
than
325
of
the
348
strikers
had
been
replaced
and
lawfully
discharged.
so
we
say
that
this
is
--
there
is
no
basis
for
this
finding
in
the
record.
the
court
below
in
considering
this
case
noted
that
the
board
had
found
that
this
vacation
plan
which
is
what
had
been
offered
to
the
union
and
rejected
by
them
and
then
put
it
back
in
august
of
1963
to
be
an
ipso
facto
per
se
violation
of
the
act.
and
frankly,
gentlemen,
the
court
just
couldn't
buy
that
type
of
a
situation.
the
court
considered
the
respondent's
conduct,
carries
with
it
an
inference
of
an
unlawful
intention,
so
compelling
that
it
is
just
fine
to
disbelieve
what
the
company
testified
about
this
and
the
court
said
we've
looked
at
this
case
from
the
american
ship
building
point
of
view
and
we
just
can't
find
it.
now,
the
court
further
said
that
when
viewed
in
a
strong
evidence
showing
otherwise
exemplary
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
company,
the
argument
fairing
the
inference
of
illegality
becomes
increasingly
weaker.
and
the
board
still
argued
erie
resistor.
as
i
pointed
out,
to
me
there's
no
factual
basis
by
which
these
cases
can
be
even
argued
together,
erie
resistor.
the
plan
was
put
in
for
the
purpose
of
breaking
a
strike
and
it
succeeded
from
the
--
were
found
in
the
record
in
doing
that.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
strike
had
been
disposed
off
before
the
plan
had
been
put
in
effect
and
it
would
not
have
affected
anyone
who
came
to
work
after
the
plan
had
been
announced
because
there
was
retroactive.
now,
the
desired
position,
and
we
still
submit,
that
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
is
correct
and
that
the
findings
to
that
court
should
be
affirmed
here
on
appeal.
now,
thank
you
very
much.
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
the
reason
that
they
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
you
have
to
remember
and
keep
in
mind
that
during
this
period
of
time,
even
though
there
was
a
strike
in
progress
and
there
were
replacements
being
made,
there
were
negotiations.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
there
were
certain
offers
by
the
company
and
certain
offers
by
the
union
on
the
board
being
negotiated.
we
had
for
example
a
complete
contract
being
negotiated.
these
--
these
concerned
wages,
hours
and
all
other
benefits
that
contract
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
this
was
a
proposal
and
--
so
this
was
put
into
effect
because
there
were
employees
who
were
inquiring
about
it
as
a
matter
of
some
concern
about
who
was
going
to
get
vacation
pay
and
what
the
policy
on
vacation
would
be.
and
as
i
said,
the
company,
as
i
understand
the
law,
has
a
right
to
put
in
any
plan
which
has
been
previously
offered
by
the
union
and
rejected
by
them
during
negotiations
when
an
impact
has
been
reached.
and
they
call
a
strike
as
being
prima
facie
evidence
of
an
impact.
so
we
have
a
situation
here
where
this
offer
had
been
made,
had
been
rejected.
there
was
a
problem
about
vacation.
they
put
in
their
plan
as
been
offered
to
union
and
all
of
the
employees
who
are
always
--
were
under
the
plan
adopted
by
the
company
received
payments.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
but
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
the
july
1
date
and
this
goes
back
in
history,
as
we've
pointed
out,
there
have
been
negotiations
and
contract
relationship
between
this
union
and
this
company
for
more
than
20
years.
when
i
first
saw
this
contract
myself
in
reference
to
vacation,
i
inquired.
no
one
could
tell
me
what
the
historical
significance
of
the
july
1
date
was.
so
because
everyone
understood
it,
it
remained
in
the
contract
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
they
have
not
but
i
think
the
only
--
the
only
--
the
only
reason
i
see
it
for
being
there
that
someone
in
the
negotiation
period
that
in
as
much
as
that
contract
was
expiring
on
may

that
the
fact
that
they
had
a
subsequent
--
they
were
receiving
the
money,
might
be
some
bargaining
too
later
used
to
keep
it
from
being
kept.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
for
the
year
prior
to
july
1.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
for
the
year
prior
to
july
1.
that
used
essentially
the
same
vacation
qualifications
that
it
was
understood
by
the
employees
or
while
as
i
said,
it
didn't
make
too
much
sense
to
me.
at
least,
they
wouldn't
seem
to
understand
it
but
me
and
so
i,
couldn't
go
along
with
what
they're
feeling
about
it.
if
there's
no
other
question,
i'll
sit
down.
thank
you.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
the
in
here
in
effect
here,
your
honor,
in
erie
resistor,
i
think
it's
apparent
what
the
company
was
trying
to
do.
it
was
trying
to
induce
employees
to
go
to
work
or
induce
replacement.
in
this
case,
all
of
these
that
had
already
been
accomplished
before
this
plan
was
even
announced.
there
was
only
23
employees
out
of
the
348
who
had
not
been
replaced.
and
when
the
plan
was
announced,
it
was
so
phrased
so
that
if
the
other
23
who
want
to
come
back,
they
would
not
have
enjoyed
the
benefits
under
it.
so
the
whole
purpose
of
the
two
plans,
i
think
is
different.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
right.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
in
this
case
to
take
a
few
moments
to
lay
out
may
be
a
little
more
detail
the
background
of
the
case
so
that
we
can
see
this,
these
facts
as
they
actually
existed
at
that
time.
now,
this
company
had
dealt
with
this
union
from
a
period
of
more
than
20
years.
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
problems,
any
unfair
labor
practices
and
the
only
thing
we
can
assume
is
that
company
and
the
union
throughout
these
years
had
adjusted
their
problems
among
themselves.
in
this
case
itself,
there's
no
finding
of
any
independent
unfair
labor
practices
to
cloud
the
issue.
so
we
have
in
this
case
a
sterile
labor
atmosphere
other
than
this
one
incident
and
we
have
the
laboratory
conditions
that
the
board
strives
to
get
when
they
consider
a
case.
it's
been
our
view,
since
this
case
originated,
that
this
is
a
primarily
a
suit
for
money.
it
stood
by
the
board
as
the
improper
forum
to
do
this.
we
urged
from
the
beginning
that
if
they
felt
that
this
vacation
money
was
due
to
these
employees
that
the
proper
forum
was
to
the
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
which
is
set
out
for
this
purpose
to
test
rights
under
contract.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
it's
--
it's
--
we
probably
would,
your
honor
but
if
there's
a
question
and
we
recognize
there's
a
question
and
we
pointed
this
out
to
the
union
in
our
letter
to
them
that
since
there
was
a
question
that
we
thought
it
was
a
matter
which
should
be
resolved
through
negotiation
as
to
what
those
rights
might
be
to
try
the
one,
answer
the
301
suit
and
two,
to
not
cause
this
action
to
arise
and
it
may
be
well
remembered
that
the
union
would
not
even
discuss
this
matter
at
the
bargaining
table
even
though
there
were
bargaining
sessions
being
held
throughout
this
period
of
time.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
i
think
we're
all
from
the
premise
that
we
pay
it
out
in
the
contract.
it's
always
been
our
position
that
we
made
no
payment
for
vacation
under
this
contract.
the
only
vacation
policy
under
which
anyone
got
any
vacation
pay
was
that
promulgated
in
august
and
only
concerned
employees
of
the
plan
at
that
time.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
because
of
this
qualifying
which
this
plan
adopted.
they
had
to
be
employees
as
of
july
1st
and
if
they
were
not
employees
after
july
1st,
they
did
not
receive
any
vacation
pay.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
sir,
it
was
not
here
--
here
is
the
practical
problem
that
you
have
in
this
such
question.
you
have
a
group
of
employees
who
went
on
a
strike
and
a
group
who
did
not.
so,
the
union
cancelled
the
contract
under
which
there
are
certain
vacation
benefits
that
they
had
earned
because
of
the
service.
they
met
all
the
qualifications
under
the
union
contract
and
under
the
expired
or
cancelled
contract.
so
you
drop
to
this
time,
we
at
this
time
was
asking
the
union,
let's
negotiate
about
this
matter
and
say
who
is
entitled
to
vacation,
who
is
not.
and
the
only
thing
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
sir.
because
during
this
period
of
time,
and
even
before
july
1st,
the
union
had
lost
his
majority
status
numerically
and
even
though
we
continued
to
negotiate,
there
was
a
petition
filed
in
december
by
the
company
and
to
determine
whether
the
union
still
represented
the
employees
and
the
union
filed
a
disclaimer
of
any
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
there's
none.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
now,
there's
other
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i
would
say,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
your
honor,
the
question
was,
had
they
qualified
under
the
agreement,
and
this
was
the
problem
that
we
tried
to
get
the
union
to
the
bargain
table
to
discuss,
this
is
the
problem
that
we
advised
their
attorney
about
by
letter
in
july
that
there
was
a
question
in
my
mind
where
they
had
any
rights
under
that
agreement.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
sir.
they
--
as
my
understanding,
the
labor
board
cannot
--
is
not
in
the
business
and
were
not
set
up
to
construe
labor
contracts,
that
section
301
of
the
act
itself
is
set
up
to
determine
these
problems.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i
don't
think
they
would
as
an
independent
isolated
matter,
i'd
say
no.
but
they
had
--
they
could
go
in
the
state
court,
federal
court
and
conceivably
under
section
301
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
contract.
you
have
to
understand,
your
honor,
that
here
we
have
a
contract
cancelled
on
may
16
by
the
union.
it's
our
position
that
we
had
no
agreement
of
any
kind
when
they
cancelled.
now,
the
board
argued
that
they
have
some
vested
rights
or
interest
but
the
cases
go
both
ways.
this
have
much
vested
these
rights
have.
so
we
say
and
took
position
with
the
board
that
these
rights
are
not
so
fixed
that
we
think
there's
some
question
to
whether
we
are
required
to
pay.
so
from
the
period
of
may
16
until
august
the
15th,
there
was
no
vacation
policy.
now,
during
this
period
of
time
and
the
record
show
that
by
july
the
1st,
which
was
only
six
weeks
after
the
strike
started,
over
75%
of
the
employees
who
went
on
strike
had
been
replaced.
now,
these
employees
had
no
reinstatement
rights
or
they
had
no
employee
rights
after
that
time.
and
this
was
six
weeks
before
the
vacation
plan
was
instituted.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
your
honor
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
--
it's
going
to
depend
on
what
position
of
the
party.
well,
let's
say
that
they
--
they
said
that
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i
would
say
no.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
they
have
the
relief
be
that
if
they
had
to
violate
contract,
they
would
have
relief
to
the
greatest
procedure
and
the
other
function
there.
i
think
that
independent
to
that,
they
can
bring
a
suit
for
these
wages
but
this
is
where
there's
no
question
about
them
being
due
to
wages.
and
that
is
where
our
case
is
different
to
as
a
genuine
dispute
between
the
company
and
the
union
in
this
case
that
these
people
were
entitled
any
vacation
pay.
but
i
think
again,
we
have
to
keep
this
in
mind
that
by
august
the
1st
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
was
the
exact
question.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir
and
if
you
refuse
to
pay
vacation
wages
to
all
or
some.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
but
are
you
referring
to,
a
refusal
to
pay
any
wages
or
part
wages
and
part
--
they
did
not
pay?
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i'm
speaking
now
that
when
you
say
all
or
part,
you
mean
that
some
of
the
striker
or
some
of
the
employees
received
while
some
did
not
receive.
i
think
that
in
that
case,
there
would
be
the
basis
for
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
right.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
i
agree
with
you.
now,
before
this,
i
think
we
have
to
take
this
a
step
further.
now,
before
this
vacation
plan
was
instituted
around
the
middle
of
august,
325
out
of
the
348
strikers
had
been
replaced.
so
you
have
a
--
you
have
only
23
unrep
--
have
not
been
replaced
at
the
time
the
vacation
plan
was
instituted.
now,
how
can
the
board
say
that
the
institution
of
this
vacation
plan
at
this
time
called
these
people
who
had
been
replaced
and
had
no
re-employment
rights
to
lose
their
interest
in
the
union
as
they
represented
in
this
plan.
now,
keeping
in
mind
too
that
this
vacation
plan
unlike
erie
did
not
attract
anybody
to
leave
the
strike
and
join
the
company
because
it
had
a
retroactive
effective
date,
which
mean
that
after
they
heard
the
plan
and
went
to
work,
that
they
wouldn't
be
affected
by
the
plan
at
all.
so
this
is
not
like
erie
at
all,
the
facts
or
situation
of
this
case.
this
is
not
made
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
people
to
break
the
strike.
they
come
in
because
they
had
already
been
replaced
or
returned
prior
to
any
effective
time
of
the
strike.
now,
vacation
plans
are
not
like
super
seniority
plans.
this
is
an
unusual
--
the
super
seniority
was
unusual
remedy
that
the
company
used.
vacation
plans
were
accepted
and
they
were
facet
of
employer-employee
relationship
whether
you
have
a
union
or
not.
so
that
all
the
company
did
in
this
instance
was
to
put
in
the
same
vacation
plan
in
august
that
they
have
offered
the
union
and
had
been
rejected
by
which
the
board
will
concede
we
had
a
right
to
do
with
any,
during
the
bargain,
at
any
offer
that
we
made
the
union
in
a
way
of
a
benefit,
wage
and
hours
that
we
have
a
right
have
a
new
bias
and
during
the
strike
to
institute
those.
now,
let's
assume
that
we
had
made
20-cent
an
hour
increase.we
could
have
put
that
into
the
nonstrikers
until
the
replacements
and
this
to
me
is
this
is
just
discriminatory
against
the
strikers
as
such
as
this
vacation
plan.
yet
this
is
accepted
and
the
board
will
not
use
this
as
a
basis
of
a
discriminatory
charge.
we've
put
in
the
charge
plan,
that's
been
offered,
and
the
union
rejected.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
if
they
qualify
it
again
under
whatever
this
plan
was.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
alright,
sir.
now,
the
--
as
been
stated
here,
this
matter
was
suggested
to
the
union
as
a
matter
of
the
vacation
pay
on
the
expired
contract
or
cancelled
contract
should
be
discussed
and
as
the
record
shows,
there
is
no
record
that
the
union
ever
discussed
it
or
brought
the
matter
up
again.
now,
from
the
above,
the
board
found
that
we
agree
with
the
trial
examiners
that
the
denial
of
vacation
pay
to
strikers
who
had
not
abandoned
the
strike
by
july
1st,
1963
unlawfully
discriminate
against
them
because
of
their
errands
to
union
strike.
now,
we're
talking
about
they're
making
it
as
option
in
the
face
of
a
plan
which
did
not
come
into
effect
for
six
weeks
after
this
and
at
which
time,
more
than
325
of
the
348
strikers
had
been
replaced
and
lawfully
discharged.
so
we
say
that
this
is
--
there
is
no
basis
for
this
finding
in
the
record.
the
court
below
in
considering
this
case
noted
that
the
board
had
found
that
this
vacation
plan
which
is
what
had
been
offered
to
the
union
and
rejected
by
them
and
then
put
it
back
in
august
of
1963
to
be
an
ipso
facto
per
se
violation
of
the
act.
and
frankly,
gentlemen,
the
court
just
couldn't
buy
that
type
of
a
situation.
the
court
considered
the
respondent's
conduct,
carries
with
it
an
inference
of
an
unlawful
intention,
so
compelling
that
it
is
just
fine
to
disbelieve
what
the
company
testified
about
this
and
the
court
said
we've
looked
at
this
case
from
the
american
ship
building
point
of
view
and
we
just
can't
find
it.
now,
the
court
further
said
that
when
viewed
in
a
strong
evidence
showing
otherwise
exemplary
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
company,
the
argument
fairing
the
inference
of
illegality
becomes
increasingly
weaker.
and
the
board
still
argued
erie
resistor.
as
i
pointed
out,
to
me
there's
no
factual
basis
by
which
these
cases
can
be
even
argued
together,
erie
resistor.
the
plan
was
put
in
for
the
purpose
of
breaking
a
strike
and
it
succeeded
from
the
--
were
found
in
the
record
in
doing
that.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
strike
had
been
disposed
off
before
the
plan
had
been
put
in
effect
and
it
would
not
have
affected
anyone
who
came
to
work
after
the
plan
had
been
announced
because
there
was
retroactive.
now,
the
desired
position,
and
we
still
submit,
that
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
is
correct
and
that
the
findings
to
that
court
should
be
affirmed
here
on
appeal.
now,
thank
you
very
much.
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
the
reason
that
they
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
well,
you
have
to
remember
and
keep
in
mind
that
during
this
period
of
time,
even
though
there
was
a
strike
in
progress
and
there
were
replacements
being
made,
there
were
negotiations.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
there
were
certain
offers
by
the
company
and
certain
offers
by
the
union
on
the
board
being
negotiated.
we
had
for
example
a
complete
contract
being
negotiated.
these
--
these
concerned
wages,
hours
and
all
other
benefits
that
contract
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
this
was
a
proposal
and
--
so
this
was
put
into
effect
because
there
were
employees
who
were
inquiring
about
it
as
a
matter
of
some
concern
about
who
was
going
to
get
vacation
pay
and
what
the
policy
on
vacation
would
be.
and
as
i
said,
the
company,
as
i
understand
the
law,
has
a
right
to
put
in
any
plan
which
has
been
previously
offered
by
the
union
and
rejected
by
them
during
negotiations
when
an
impact
has
been
reached.
and
they
call
a
strike
as
being
prima
facie
evidence
of
an
impact.
so
we
have
a
situation
here
where
this
offer
had
been
made,
had
been
rejected.
there
was
a
problem
about
vacation.
they
put
in
their
plan
as
been
offered
to
union
and
all
of
the
employees
who
are
always
--
were
under
the
plan
adopted
by
the
company
received
payments.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
but
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
the
july
1
date
and
this
goes
back
in
history,
as
we've
pointed
out,
there
have
been
negotiations
and
contract
relationship
between
this
union
and
this
company
for
more
than
20
years.
when
i
first
saw
this
contract
myself
in
reference
to
vacation,
i
inquired.
no
one
could
tell
me
what
the
historical
significance
of
the
july
1
date
was.
so
because
everyone
understood
it,
it
remained
in
the
contract
--
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
they
have
not
but
i
think
the
only
--
the
only
--
the
only
reason
i
see
it
for
being
there
that
someone
in
the
negotiation
period
that
in
as
much
as
that
contract
was
expiring
on
may
16
that
the
fact
that
they
had
a
subsequent
--
they
were
receiving
the
money,
might
be
some
bargaining
too
later
used
to
keep
it
from
being
kept.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
for
the
year
prior
to
july
1.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
no,
for
the
year
prior
to
july
1.
that
used
essentially
the
same
vacation
qualifications
that
it
was
understood
by
the
employees
or
while
as
i
said,
it
didn't
make
too
much
sense
to
me.
at
least,
they
wouldn't
seem
to
understand
it
but
me
and
so
i,
couldn't
go
along
with
what
they're
feeling
about
it.
if
there's
no
other
question,
i'll
sit
down.
thank
you.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
the
in
here
in
effect
here,
your
honor,
in
erie
resistor,
i
think
it's
apparent
what
the
company
was
trying
to
do.
it
was
trying
to
induce
employees
to
go
to
work
or
induce
replacement.
in
this
case,
all
of
these
that
had
already
been
accomplished
before
this
plan
was
even
announced.
there
was
only
23
employees
out
of
the
348
who
had
not
been
replaced.
and
when
the
plan
was
announced,
it
was
so
phrased
so
that
if
the
other
23
who
want
to
come
back,
they
would
not
have
enjoyed
the
benefits
under
it.
so
the
whole
purpose
of
the
two
plans,
i
think
is
different.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
right.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
that's
correct.
mr.
o.
r.
t.
bowden
yes,
sir.
