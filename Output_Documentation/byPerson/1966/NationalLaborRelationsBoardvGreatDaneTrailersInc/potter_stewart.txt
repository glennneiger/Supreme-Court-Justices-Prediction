well,
that
was
true
the
agreement
was
no
longer
in
effect
and
it
was
only
because
of
the
agreement
that
they
had
any
right
to
vacation
pay
as
of
july
1st,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
was
and
remained
an
issue,
i
suppose,
between
the
parties,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
provided
for
no
payments
until
july
1st,
as
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
of
july
1st,
there
was
no
such
agreement.
it
was
--
and
it
was
only
because
of
the
agreement
that
there
was
any
right
as
of
july
1st.
justice
potter
stewart
on
july
1st?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
remains
an
issue
between
the
parties,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
he
elected
to
make
vacation
payments
to
no
one
and
which
i
understood
from
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
be
that
is
strikers
or
nonstrikers,
you
wouldn't
possibly
have
an
8
(a)
(3)
violations.
you
might
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
301
for
violation
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
be
an
action
perhaps
on
the
301
too?
justice
potter
stewart
to
go
and
sue
them.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
when
--
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
mr.
bowden.
justice
potter
stewart
when
the
strike
was
finally
settled,
when
in
december
of
the
year,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
it
was
after
the
settlement
there
was
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
clearly,
clearly
if
you
refuse
to
pay
because
they
were
on
strike,
there
would
be
an
open
and
shut
unfairly
labor
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
refuse
to
anybody
his
wages,
that
would
simply
be
a
breach
of
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
point,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
here,
there
was
a
--
this
plan
could
not,
your
point
is,
have
possibly
been
an
inducement
to
make
striking
employees
return
to
work
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
any
who
return
to
work
after
the
announcement
of
this
plan
would
not
have
received
any
benefits
under
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
makes
it
different
from
erie.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
to
be
your
argument,
the
future
effects,
future
strikes.
that
has
to
be
your
argument
mr.
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
does
make
it
different
from
erie
resistor
not
only
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
only
in
the
quantum
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
favor
to
them
shown
by
between
super
seniority
and
vacation
pay.
but
much
more
important
is
that
we
would
have
no
immediate
effect
upon
inducing
these
strikers
to
return.
justice

stewart
yes.
