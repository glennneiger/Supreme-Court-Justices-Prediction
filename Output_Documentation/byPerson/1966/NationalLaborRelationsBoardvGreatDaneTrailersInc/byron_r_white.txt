you

you

--
why
did

make

yes,

you
didn't
make

to
all

yes,
but
that
was
--
you
were
making
payments
for
prior
years.
justice
byron

you
really
mean
it,
the
refusal
to
pay
accrued
wages
--
justice

white
--
because
people
were
on

is
not
an

they
refused

then
they
refused
because
these

were
on

justice

but
at

you
have
had
to
give
the
increase
to
everybody
who
was
back
at
work
at
that
time?
justice
byron

white
i
never
did
understand
that
why
it
was
the

adopted
this

there
was

no

at

that

the

yes.

even
it
was
a
good
business
policy
to
put
in

plan.
justice

what
was
the
purpose
of
adopting
the

cut-off
for

when
the

was
in
the
new

there
actually
lose

well,

it's

figured
out

made
