mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
just
wonder
and
if
--
if
they
cancel
the
contract
and
at
the
time
they
cancelled
it
that
there
are
wages
due
to
them,
you'd
have
to
pay
them
as
wages,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
--
now,
on
the
other
hand,
they
had
worked
--
worked
according
to
their
contract
and
had
earned
certain
vacation
rights
at
that
time
they
terminated
but
why
wouldn't
they
--
why
wouldn't
they
be
entitled
to
that
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
a
question
of
law
for
the
labor
board
to
determine?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
you
haven't
paid
them
their
wages,
would
they
have
any
relief
for
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
just
see
if
i
understand
you.
if
these
men
went
on
strike
at
the
time
and
they
went
on
strike,
you
owe
them
wages
that
they
have
--
for
work
they
had
performed
and
you
said,
“well,
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
for
those
things
but
when
it
comes
to
bargaining,
we'll
take
it
up
at
the
bargaining
table.
now,
would
they
have
any
relief
before
the
board?
is
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
--
just
take
the
position
that
i
gave
you.
that's
a
very
simple
thing
and
i
don't
want
to
complicate
it
than
this
is
necessary.
in
that
simple
situation,
would
they
have
any
relief
before
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they'd
have
to
go
--
they'd
have
to
sue
under
301
and
some
other
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
exact
question.
yes,
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
talking
about
wages.
i
wasn't
talking
about
vacation.
i
was

about
wages
at
that
time
and
exactly
the
way
justice
white
put
it.
