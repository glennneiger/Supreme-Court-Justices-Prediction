mr.
arnold
ordman
--
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
to
a
board
order.
the
board's
order
was
based
on
a
finding
that
the
employer,
great
dane
trailers,
inc.
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
denying
payment
of
previously
earned
vacation
benefits
to
strikers
who
elected
to
remain
on
strike
or
who
had
been
replaced
while
paying
such
benefits
to
nonstrikers
and
strikers
who
abandoned
the
strike
and
returned
to
work
by
a
certain
date.
the
court
below
denied
enforcement
to
the
board's
order
on
the
ground
that
this
disparity
of
treatment,
notwithstanding
the
return
on
strike
activity
was
not
unlawful
despi
--
absent,
an
independent
showing
or
an
illegal
motive
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
now,
the
record
is
devoid
of
evidence
that
apart
from
the
disparity
of
treatment
itself,
the
employer
had
a
subjective
intent
to
penalize
the
employees
for
their
strike
activity.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
and
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
such
independent
evidence
of
subjective
intent
is
in
the
circumstances
here
presented
a
pre-conditioned
or
finding
of
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
before
stating
the
facts,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
note
very
briefly
that
we
see
the
issue
in
this
case
as
paralleling
the
issue
in
erie
resistor.
in
that
case,
as
the
court
will
recall,
the
employer
awarded
super
seniority,
super
seniority
to
replacements
and
returning
strikers
as
against
those
who
remained
on
strike
and
the
question
presented
there
as
here
was
whether
you
would
had
to
have
an
independent
showing
of
an
intent
to
penalize
strikers,
has
a
precondition
to
finding
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
that
case
and
this
court
held
that
such
a
showing
was
not
required.
now,
great
dane
trailers,
inc.
manufactures
truck
trailers
in
this
plant
in
south,
i
mean
its
plant
at
savannah,
georgia
through
its
employees
for
some
years
have
been
presented
by
the
boilermakers
union.
the
most
recent
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
company
and
the
union
was
for
a
three-year
period
which
expired
in
march
31st,
1963
and
was
terminable
thereafter
upon
proper
notice
by
either
of
the
parties.
now,
so
far
as
relevant
here,
that
agreement
provided
that
employees
with
more
than
60
days
of
service,
would
receive
annual
vacation
pay
on
the
friday
nearest
july
1
of
each
year.
those
who
had
worked
at
least
1525
hours
or
approximately
38
weeks,
the
proceeding
year
would
receive
a
weeks
vacation
pay
and
for
those
who
work
less,
in
as
little
actually
as
a
169
hours,
they
got
a
diminished
scale
of
payments
which
was
actually
set
forth
in
the
contract
for
those
who
work
fewer
hours.
now,
employees
who
had
at
least
five
years
or
more
of
continuous
employment
to
the
company
got
double
paid.
but
the
agreement
specifically
provided
that
those
workers
who
quit
or
were
laid
off
were
otherwise
terminated
even
during
the
course
of
the
year
and
didn't
survived
until
july
1st
nevertheless
would
get
pay
if
they
had
worked
the
minimum
60
days.
on
april
30th,
1963,
the
union
gave
timely
notice
to
terminate
the
agreement
as
of
may
16,
approximately
two
weeks
later.
and
on
may
16th,
the
union
went
out
on
an
economic
strike
to
support
its
bargaining
demands.
and
about
348,
i
believe,
of
the
company's
400
employees
joined
the
strike.
now,
within
a
matter
of
six
weeks,
by
july
1st,
about
259
of
the
350
strikers
had
been
replaced
and
a
few
of
the
other
strikers
went
back
to
work.
the
strike,
however,
continued
for
several
months
longer.
but
early
in
july,
about
300
of
the
strikers
individually
and
through
their
union,
asked
the
company
for
the
vacation
pay
they
had
earned
under
their
agreement
which
had
now
been
terminated.
the
company
replied
by
a
letter,
which
was
dated
july
12
and
says
--
said
in
effect,
“because
you,
the
union,
have
terminated
the
agreement,
there
isn't
any
provision
for
vacation
pay
in
effect
and
suggested
that
may
be
that
matter
could
be
taken
up
at
the
bargaining
negotiations.”
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
right.
that
was
a
working
condition
set
up
by
the
agreement
but
under
the
terms
of
the
agreement
and
while
it
was
in
effect,
this
right
had
accrued.
this
was
work
pay
they
had
during
the
period
of
the
agreement.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that's
right
because
the
agreement
was
in
effect
until
may
16th,
just
six
weeks
earlier.
mr.
arnold
ordman
it
provided
that
payments
would
be
made
on
the
friday
near
july
1.
mr.
arnold
ordman
not
exactly
because
under
the
agreement
itself,
for
example,
people
who
had
been
quit
or
discharged
during
the
year
and
prior
to
that
date
were
entitled
to
pay
and
did
receive
it.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
record
shows
it.
on
july
1st.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that's
correct.
now,
the
company
--
their
company
suggested
that
this
matter
might
be
resolved
at
the
bargaining
table,
which
is
also
in
the
record
an
indication
they
suggest
that
this
might
be
resolved
by
an
independent
lawsuit
under
the
contract.
now,
needless
to
have
at
this
point,
there
weren't
any
bargaining
negotiations
so
far
as
the
record
shows
on
this
issue
but
--
and
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
law
and
not
in
dispute
that
the
employees
couldn't
be
forced
to
bargain
away
any
contract
rights
or
statutory
rights
which
they
have
or
which
had
accrued.
now,
shortly
thereafter,
in
august
--
and
this
was
in
july
--
in
august,
the
company
did
make
vacation
payments
to
all
the
nonstrikers
and
to
those
strikers,
who
had
abandoned
the
strike
before
july
1st,
and
had
not
been
--
and
had
not
been
replaced
but
the
returning
strikers
even
those
who
returned
who
were
replaced
and
those
who
elected
to
continue
to
exercise
their
statutory
right
to
strike,
received
no
vacation
pay
even
though
under
the
--
during
the
existence
of
the
contract
their
right
to
vacation
pay
had
accrued.
now,
the
company
defended
its
action
before
the
board
on
the
ground
that
the
payments
were
made,
that
the
payments
that
were
made
were
made
not
under
the
contract
which
has
been
terminated
but
under
a
unilateral
policy
which
it
said
that
it
adopted
following
the
termination
of
the
contract
but
it
concedes,
and
these
are
its
own
words,
that
the
unilateral
policy
incorporated
substantially
the
same
conditions
as
to
the
contract.
now,
as
for
its
refusal
to
make
payments
to
those
who
continued
on
strike
and
to
replace
strikers,
it
simply
explained
that,
well
there
was
a
break
in
the
length
of
service
and
the
employees
who
weren't
--
didn't
get
paid
were
not
working
as
of
july
1st
and
the
strikers
who
were
replaced
weren't
employees
at
all.
now,
the
board
found
that
by
denying
this
vacation
pay,
the
strikers
who
would
not
abandon
the
strike
or
had
been
replaced,
the
company
discriminated
against
them
because
of
their
adherence
to
the
strike,
their
continued
exercise
of
the
right
to
strike.
now,
whether
the
company
made
its
selection
of
who
got
paid
and
who
didn't
get
paid,
pursuant
to
the
contract
provisions
or
pursuant
to
its
unilateral
policy
which
have
formulated
after
the
contract
terminated,
the
board
said
this
was
really
immaterial.
they're
not
under
the
board's
holding,
it
stated,
was
that
under
the
law,
strikers
have
to
be
treated
uniformly
with
nonstrikers
with
the
relation
to
whatever
benefits
accrued
to
them
from
their
employment
relationship.
in
this
connection,
incidentally,
the
board
did
order
that
the
strikers
be
awarded
back
pay
but
it
specifically
excluded
any
compu
--
that
computation
of
the
back
pay
due
them
anytime
in
which
they
were
not
working
and
which
they
were
on
strike.
the
board
incidentally
also
agreed
and
this
is
agreed
that
there
wasn't
any
independent
subjective
evidence
of
disparity
of
treat
--
of
intent
to
penalize
strikers.
now,
the
court
below
disagreed
with
the
court.
before
the
court
below,
we
urged
the
erie
resistor
principle
and
the
court
below
made
no
mention
of
erie
resistor.
instead,
it
cited
the
more
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
the
american
ship
building
case
and
it
said
that
the
american
ship
building
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
employers
conduct
carries
with
it
any
other
inference,
any
other
inference
of
a
legitimate
motive,
the
inference
of
illegality
which
would
otherwise
bring
does
not
control.
now,
the
court
recognized
that
the
record
in
the
case
before
it,
did
not
disclose
any
such
legitimate
motive
and
i
take
it
that
means
that
it
rejected
the
reasons
the
company
gave
it
before
the
board.
it
said
the
record
doesn't
disclose
any
legitimate
motive
but
the
court
below
itself
suggested
legitimate
motives
which
might
have
motivated
the
employer.
for
example,
it
suggested
that
may
be
the
company
did
what
it
did
to
reduce
expenses.
maybe
it
did
it
to
encourage
longer
tenure
among
the
present
employees
or
may
be
it
did
it
to
discourage
early
leave
before
vacation
periods
and
because
the
court
below
said
because
these
motivations
may
have
existed
and
the
court
below
concluded
that
the
board
was
required
to
and
failed
to
establish
of
the
company's
action
were
prompted
by
some
independent
motive
to
penalize
the
strikers
and
the
court
denied
the
petition
for
enforcement.
now,
there
is
some
subordinate
matters
to
which
i
think
are
adequately
covered
in
the
brief.
i'd
like
to
reach
what
i
think
is
the
overriding
issue,
whether
the
interpretation
put
by
the
court
below
on
the
american
ship
decision
and
its
apparent
rejection
of
--
we
think
its
apparent
rejection
of
the
erie
resistor
principles
applied
to
the
fact
of
this
case.
now,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
here
as
an
erie
resistor,
erred
in
holding
that
in
the
absence
of
a
finding
of
a
specific
illegal
intent,
a
legitimate
business
purpose
is
always
a
defense
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
now,
the
court
below
doesn't,
this
court
does
not
and
we
do
not
again
say
the
relevance
and
the
importance
and
even
then
the
necessity
in
8
(a)
(3)
cases
of
showing
an
employer's
intent
or
motive
to
discriminate
or
to
interfere
with
union
rights.
but
as
radio
officers
has
established,
specific
evidence
of
such
subjective
intent
is
in
justice
reed's
language
not
an
indispensable
element
of
proof
of
violation.
now,
such
evidence
is
required,
of
course,
in
the
typical
situation.
take
the
normal
discharge
case
which
still
is
a
large
portion
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
work.
there,
many
otherwise
innocent
or
even
ambiguous
actions
which
are
normally
incident
of
the
conduct
of
--
an
employer's
conduct
of
his
business
are
exempt
from
the
act's
stretches,
unless
specific
intent
of
--
specific
evidence
of
a
subjective
intent
to
discriminate
or
encourage
or
discourage
union
activity
as
shown.
now,
this
requirement
is
imposed
because
there's
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
conduct
itself
in
the
normal
discharge
case;
there's
nothing
in
the
conduct
itself
which
necessarily
and
foreseeably
evinces
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect
of
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
employer's
normal
operation
of
his
business.
but
we
suggest
that
this
category
of
cases
has
to
be
distinguished
from
the
much
smaller
category
and
this
court
has
done
so
from
the
last
frequent
type
of
case
typified
by
radio
officers,
by
erie
resistor
and
we
believe
this
case,
where
the
necessary
foundation
of
discriminatory
intent
derives
from
what
this
court
has
called
the
“inherently
discriminatory”
or
destructive
nature
of
the
conduct
itself.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
sir.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
because
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
believe
the
remedy
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
here.
mr.
arnold
ordman
in
other
words,
the
--
restoring
--
restoring
of
--
giving
the
vacation
payments
to
the
employees
on
the
same
proposition
that
was
given
to
the
nonstrikers.
we
believe,
for
example,
a
contract
is
set
out.
there's
no
quarrel
here
that
vacation
benefits
are
a
term
and
condition
of
employment.
and
once
they
had
been
established
by
the
contract,
they
would
continue
after
the
termination.
mr.
arnold
ordman
and
that
under
the
contract,
because
it's
a
term
and
condition
of
employment
which
had
--
which
had
--
once
established
by
the
contract,
continues
to
exist
and
cannot
be
unilaterally
changed.
mr.
arnold
ordman
any
more
of
them
for
example
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
think
the
court,
the
board
would
still
reach
the
same
conclusion.
for
example,
if
he
elected
for
the
first
time,
with
no
background,
if
he
elected
to
make
vacation
payments
to
employees
who
did
not
strike
and
withheld
them
from
employees
who
did
strike,
then
the
discrimination
would
be
apparent
on
its
face
even
in
that
situation.
he
may
not
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
these,
i
suppose,
within
the
board's,
the
discretion,
i
suppose
would
be
a
matter
whether
to
set
things
right.
it
should
be
make
payments
to
the
employees,
to
the
strikers,
possibly
withholding
from
the
nonstrikers
but
i
don't
conceive
the
latter
continues.
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
i
think
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
and
i
think
there
would
be
no
8
(a)
(3)
violations
as
i
see
it.
there
may
well,
however,
has
been
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation
because
this
would
be
a
unilateral
change
of
a
working
condition
and
this
court
has
established
the
working
conditions
having
been
established
by
the
contract
even
though
the
contract
expired,
the
working
conditions
like
the
wages
in
hours
would
continue.
the
employers
would
not
unilaterally
change
them
and
if
he
did,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
his
bargaining
application.
but
it
would
not
be
an
8
(a)
(3).
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
it
could
be.
that
could
be
an
action
under
301
under
the
contract.
yes.
now,
we
suggest
therefore
--
now,
we
are
not
saying
that
this
is
the
end
of
thing.
the
discriminatory
intent
is
established,
of
course,
by
the
nature
of
the
conduct
itself.
but
this
court
has
suggested
in
erie
resistor
there
are
countervailing
considerations;
there
could
be
a
legitimate
motive,
a
legitimate
objective
which
would
overweigh
the
discriminatory
intent.
now,
without
dwelling
on
it
too
much,
i
simply
say
that
there
are
cases
and
we
have
cited
some
of
these
illustrative
situations
on
page
12
of
our
brief
where
a
legitimate
business
consideration
can
override
the
discriminatory
intent
which
is
inherent
in
the
conduct.
but
certainly,
the
company
presented
none
as
the
board
below
found.
and
even
assuming
that
the
court
as
it
did
itself
speculate
as
to
what
might
have
been
the
reason
and
it
supplied
this
reasons,
the
company
did
not.
we
suggest
that
even
that
--
even
if
that
were
proper,
the
speculative
reasons
the
court
below
assigned
don't
carry
the
ball
because
this
board
--
the
board
did
weigh
these
considerations
and
in
its
judgment
under
this
court
whether
that
judgment
is
certainly
subject
to
the
review
by
the
courts
and
by
this
court.
but
this
court
has
suggested
that
there
must
be
a
little
circumspection
attending
court
review
of
that
judgment.
now,
we
find
nothing
in
american
ship
which
is
inconsistent
with
erie
resistor
and
we
think
to
the
extent
this
court
mentioned
the
erie
resistor
principle
in
american
ship
and
it
did
cite
that
case
for
we
think
it
specifically
indorsed
erie
resistor.
now,
the
bulk
of
the
respondent's
argument
here
really
is
that
the
impact
of
vacation
pay,
this
case
is
different
from
erie
resistor
because
the
impact
of
withholding
vacation
pay
benefits
even
though
a
term
and
condition
applied.
mr.
arnold
ordman
wasn't
as
--
excuse
me.
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
but
apparently
everybody
was
working
for
the
company,
did
not
go
on
strike,
received
vacation
pay.
now
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
provided
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
people
who
came
back
after
that
did
not
get
payments,
did
not
get
paid.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
now,
the
burden
of
respondent's
argument
really
is
that
the
impact
of
what
the
company
did
in
this
case
was
not
as
serious
as
the
impact
of
super
seniority
in
the
erie
resistor
case
and
i
think
we
might,
without
prejudice
even
make
this
concession.
but
then,
it
is
again
a
question
of
balancing
because
equally
true
that
on
the
converse
side,
the
employer
in
erie
resistor
would
make
and
did
make
a
very
cogent
case
which
this
court
assumed
that
he
simply
couldn't
stand
business
unless
he
gave
that
super
seniority
to
offer
that
super
seniority
to
replacements.
now,
as
i
say
in
this
case,
we
think
no
serious
business
exigency
to
suggest
except
possibly
the
saving
of
money
which
would
necessitate
the
action
of
the
employer
who
took
here
in
derogation
of
the
right
to
strike
which
this
court
has
said
carry
some
sort
of
special
safeguard.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
right.
if
--
if
he
--
if
he
has
made
in
fact
the
mistake
of
law
let's
us
assume
this
alright
or
whatever
it
--
if
in
law
his
action
necessarily
discriminates
against
strikers
versus
nonstrikers
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
--
he
must
be
taken
to
have
intended
this
discriminatory
effect.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
if
he
initiates
a
term
and
condition
of
employment.
and
it
is
a
term
and
condition
of
employment,
he
cannot
apply
it
discriminatory
as
between
strikers
and
nonstrikers.
then
he
has
penalizing
people
for
exercising
their
lawful
right
to
strike.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
ordman
only
two
very
brief
comments.
i
don't
know
whether
inadvertently
an
impression
might
have
been
created
that
there
was
bargaining
about
this
unilateral
vacation
plan.
the
record
is
flat
and
the
testimony
by
the
--
in
page
63
of
the
record
by
harvey
granger,
who
was
a
plant
manager,
“do
you
recall,
mr.
granger
if
vacation
pay
was
ever
discussed
in
the
bargaining
sessions
with
the
union
after
the
union
that
cancelled
the
contract?”
answer,
“it
was
not.”
the
only
other
thing
i
might
just
touch
briefly
on
the
most
recent
question
about
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
sir.
i
want
to
touch
just
briefly
on
the
last
question
about
the
effects.
i
think
i
pointed
out
that
we
might
get
out
prejudiced,
concede
that
the
impact
in
super
seniority
was
not
in
the
super
seniority
case
probably
greater
than
it
is
in
this
case
but
there
certainly
is
in
effect
on
the
strikers
or
employees
who
are
aware
and
will
be
aware
in
the
future
that
if
they
--
unless
they
proffered
their
right
to
strike,
they
may
be
endangered
in
the
future
if
they
strike.
they
might
be
endangered
of
losing
benefits
that
would
otherwise
accrue
to
them
if
they
didn't
strike
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
sir.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
ordman
as
we
see
this
case
in
the
balancing
consideration
that
this
court
talked
about
in
the
erie
resistor,
the
weights
on
both
sides
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
--
are
correspondingly
less
but
it
must
be
viewed
in
that
context.
mr.
arnold
ordman
--
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
to
a
board
order.
the
board's
order
was
based
on
a
finding
that
the
employer,
great
dane
trailers,
inc.
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
denying
payment
of
previously
earned
vacation
benefits
to
strikers
who
elected
to
remain
on
strike
or
who
had
been
replaced
while
paying
such
benefits
to
nonstrikers
and
strikers
who
abandoned
the
strike
and
returned
to
work
by
a
certain
date.
the
court
below
denied
enforcement
to
the
board's
order
on
the
ground
that
this
disparity
of
treatment,
notwithstanding
the
return
on
strike
activity
was
not
unlawful
despi
--
absent,
an
independent
showing
or
an
illegal
motive
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
now,
the
record
is
devoid
of
evidence
that
apart
from
the
disparity
of
treatment
itself,
the
employer
had
a
subjective
intent
to
penalize
the
employees
for
their
strike
activity.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
and
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
such
independent
evidence
of
subjective
intent
is
in
the
circumstances
here
presented
a
pre-conditioned
or
finding
of
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
before
stating
the
facts,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
note
very
briefly
that
we
see
the
issue
in
this
case
as
paralleling
the
issue
in
erie
resistor.
in
that
case,
as
the
court
will
recall,
the
employer
awarded
super
seniority,
super
seniority
to
replacements
and
returning
strikers
as
against
those
who
remained
on
strike
and
the
question
presented
there
as
here
was
whether
you
would
had
to
have
an
independent
showing
of
an
intent
to
penalize
strikers,
has
a
precondition
to
finding
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
that
case
and
this
court
held
that
such
a
showing
was
not
required.
now,
great
dane
trailers,
inc.
manufactures
truck
trailers
in
this
plant
in
south,
i
mean
its
plant
at
savannah,
georgia
through
its
employees
for
some
years
have
been
presented
by
the
boilermakers
union.
the
most
recent
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
company
and
the
union
was
for
a
three-year
period
which
expired
in
march
31st,
1963
and
was
terminable
thereafter
upon
proper
notice
by
either
of
the
parties.
now,
so
far
as
relevant
here,
that
agreement
provided
that
employees
with
more
than
60
days
of
service,
would
receive
annual
vacation
pay
on
the
friday
nearest
july
1
of
each
year.
those
who
had
worked
at
least
1525
hours
or
approximately
38
weeks,
the
proceeding
year
would
receive
a
weeks
vacation
pay
and
for
those
who
work
less,
in
as
little
actually
as
a
169
hours,
they
got
a
diminished
scale
of
payments
which
was
actually
set
forth
in
the
contract
for
those
who
work
fewer
hours.
now,
employees
who
had
at
least
five
years
or
more
of
continuous
employment
to
the
company
got
double
paid.
but
the
agreement
specifically
provided
that
those
workers
who
quit
or
were
laid
off
were
otherwise
terminated
even
during
the
course
of
the
year
and
didn't
survived
until
july
1st
nevertheless
would
get
pay
if
they
had
worked
the
minimum
60
days.
on
april
30th,
1963,
the
union
gave
timely
notice
to
terminate
the
agreement
as
of
may
16,
approximately
two
weeks
later.
and
on
may
16th,
the
union
went
out
on
an
economic
strike
to
support
its
bargaining
demands.
and
about
348,
i
believe,
of
the
company's
400
employees
joined
the
strike.
now,
within
a
matter
of
six
weeks,
by
july
1st,
about
259
of
the
350
strikers
had
been
replaced
and
a
few
of
the
other
strikers
went
back
to
work.
the
strike,
however,
continued
for
several
months
longer.
but
early
in
july,
about
300
of
the
strikers
individually
and
through
their
union,
asked
the
company
for
the
vacation
pay
they
had
earned
under
their
agreement
which
had
now
been
terminated.
the
company
replied
by
a
letter,
which
was
dated
july
12
and
says
--
said
in
effect,
“because
you,
the
union,
have
terminated
the
agreement,
there
isn't
any
provision
for
vacation
pay
in
effect
and
suggested
that
may
be
that
matter
could
be
taken
up
at
the
bargaining
negotiations.”
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
right.
that
was
a
working
condition
set
up
by
the
agreement
but
under
the
terms
of
the
agreement
and
while
it
was
in
effect,
this
right
had
accrued.
this
was
work
pay
they
had
during
the
period
of
the
agreement.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that's
right
because
the
agreement
was
in
effect
until
may
16th,
just
six
weeks
earlier.
mr.
arnold
ordman
it
provided
that
payments
would
be
made
on
the
friday
near
july
1.
mr.
arnold
ordman
not
exactly
because
under
the
agreement
itself,
for
example,
people
who
had
been
quit
or
discharged
during
the
year
and
prior
to
that
date
were
entitled
to
pay
and
did
receive
it.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
record
shows
it.
on
july
1st.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that's
correct.
now,
the
company
--
their
company
suggested
that
this
matter
might
be
resolved
at
the
bargaining
table,
which
is
also
in
the
record
an
indication
they
suggest
that
this
might
be
resolved
by
an
independent
lawsuit
under
the
contract.
now,
needless
to
have
at
this
point,
there
weren't
any
bargaining
negotiations
so
far
as
the
record
shows
on
this
issue
but
--
and
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
law
and
not
in
dispute
that
the
employees
couldn't
be
forced
to
bargain
away
any
contract
rights
or
statutory
rights
which
they
have
or
which
had
accrued.
now,
shortly
thereafter,
in
august
--
and
this
was
in
july
--
in
august,
the
company
did
make
vacation
payments
to
all
the
nonstrikers
and
to
those
strikers,
who
had
abandoned
the
strike
before
july
1st,
and
had
not
been
--
and
had
not
been
replaced
but
the
returning
strikers
even
those
who
returned
who
were
replaced
and
those
who
elected
to
continue
to
exercise
their
statutory
right
to
strike,
received
no
vacation
pay
even
though
under
the
--
during
the
existence
of
the
contract
their
right
to
vacation
pay
had
accrued.
now,
the
company
defended
its
action
before
the
board
on
the
ground
that
the
payments
were
made,
that
the
payments
that
were
made
were
made
not
under
the
contract
which
has
been
terminated
but
under
a
unilateral
policy
which
it
said
that
it
adopted
following
the
termination
of
the
contract
but
it
concedes,
and
these
are
its
own
words,
that
the
unilateral
policy
incorporated
substantially
the
same
conditions
as
to
the
contract.
now,
as
for
its
refusal
to
make
payments
to
those
who
continued
on
strike
and
to
replace
strikers,
it
simply
explained
that,
well
there
was
a
break
in
the
length
of
service
and
the
employees
who
weren't
--
didn't
get
paid
were
not
working
as
of
july
1st
and
the
strikers
who
were
replaced
weren't
employees
at
all.
now,
the
board
found
that
by
denying
this
vacation
pay,
the
strikers
who
would
not
abandon
the
strike
or
had
been
replaced,
the
company
discriminated
against
them
because
of
their
adherence
to
the
strike,
their
continued
exercise
of
the
right
to
strike.
now,
whether
the
company
made
its
selection
of
who
got
paid
and
who
didn't
get
paid,
pursuant
to
the
contract
provisions
or
pursuant
to
its
unilateral
policy
which
have
formulated
after
the
contract
terminated,
the
board
said
this
was
really
immaterial.
they're
not
under
the
board's
holding,
it
stated,
was
that
under
the
law,
strikers
have
to
be
treated
uniformly
with
nonstrikers
with
the
relation
to
whatever
benefits
accrued
to
them
from
their
employment
relationship.
in
this
connection,
incidentally,
the
board
did
order
that
the
strikers
be
awarded
back
pay
but
it
specifically
excluded
any
compu
--
that
computation
of
the
back
pay
due
them
anytime
in
which
they
were
not
working
and
which
they
were
on
strike.
the
board
incidentally
also
agreed
and
this
is
agreed
that
there
wasn't
any
independent
subjective
evidence
of
disparity
of
treat
--
of
intent
to
penalize
strikers.
now,
the
court
below
disagreed
with
the
court.
before
the
court
below,
we
urged
the
erie
resistor
principle
and
the
court
below
made
no
mention
of
erie
resistor.
instead,
it
cited
the
more
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
the
american
ship
building
case
and
it
said
that
the
american
ship
building
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
employers
conduct
carries
with
it
any
other
inference,
any
other
inference
of
a
legitimate
motive,
the
inference
of
illegality
which
would
otherwise
bring
does
not
control.
now,
the
court
recognized
that
the
record
in
the
case
before
it,
did
not
disclose
any
such
legitimate
motive
and
i
take
it
that
means
that
it
rejected
the
reasons
the
company
gave
it
before
the
board.
it
said
the
record
doesn't
disclose
any
legitimate
motive
but
the
court
below
itself
suggested
legitimate
motives
which
might
have
motivated
the
employer.
for
example,
it
suggested
that
may
be
the
company
did
what
it
did
to
reduce
expenses.
maybe
it
did
it
to
encourage
longer
tenure
among
the
present
employees
or
may
be
it
did
it
to
discourage
early
leave
before
vacation
periods
and
because
the
court
below
said
because
these
motivations
may
have
existed
and
the
court
below
concluded
that
the
board
was
required
to
and
failed
to
establish
of
the
company's
action
were
prompted
by
some
independent
motive
to
penalize
the
strikers
and
the
court
denied
the
petition
for
enforcement.
now,
there
is
some
subordinate
matters
to
which
i
think
are
adequately
covered
in
the
brief.
i'd
like
to
reach
what
i
think
is
the
overriding
issue,
whether
the
interpretation
put
by
the
court
below
on
the
american
ship
decision
and
its
apparent
rejection
of
--
we
think
its
apparent
rejection
of
the
erie
resistor
principles
applied
to
the
fact
of
this
case.
now,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
here
as
an
erie
resistor,
erred
in
holding
that
in
the
absence
of
a
finding
of
a
specific
illegal
intent,
a
legitimate
business
purpose
is
always
a
defense
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
now,
the
court
below
doesn't,
this
court
does
not
and
we
do
not
again
say
the
relevance
and
the
importance
and
even
then
the
necessity
in
8
(a)
(3)
cases
of
showing
an
employer's
intent
or
motive
to
discriminate
or
to
interfere
with
union
rights.
but
as
radio
officers
has
established,
specific
evidence
of
such
subjective
intent
is
in
justice
reed's
language
not
an
indispensable
element
of
proof
of
violation.
now,
such
evidence
is
required,
of
course,
in
the
typical
situation.
take
the
normal
discharge
case
which
still
is
a
large
portion
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
work.
there,
many
otherwise
innocent
or
even
ambiguous
actions
which
are
normally
incident
of
the
conduct
of
--
an
employer's
conduct
of
his
business
are
exempt
from
the
act's
stretches,
unless
specific
intent
of
--
specific
evidence
of
a
subjective
intent
to
discriminate
or
encourage
or
discourage
union
activity
as
shown.
now,
this
requirement
is
imposed
because
there's
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
conduct
itself
in
the
normal
discharge
case;
there's
nothing
in
the
conduct
itself
which
necessarily
and
foreseeably
evinces
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect
of
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
employer's
normal
operation
of
his
business.
but
we
suggest
that
this
category
of
cases
has
to
be
distinguished
from
the
much
smaller
category
and
this
court
has
done
so
from
the
last
frequent
type
of
case
typified
by
radio
officers,
by
erie
resistor
and
we
believe
this
case,
where
the
necessary
foundation
of
discriminatory
intent
derives
from
what
this
court
has
called
the
“inherently
discriminatory”
or
destructive
nature
of
the
conduct
itself.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
sir.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
because
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
believe
the
remedy
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
here.
mr.
arnold
ordman
in
other
words,
the
--
restoring
--
restoring
of
--
giving
the
vacation
payments
to
the
employees
on
the
same
proposition
that
was
given
to
the
nonstrikers.
we
believe,
for
example,
a
contract
is
set
out.
there's
no
quarrel
here
that
vacation
benefits
are
a
term
and
condition
of
employment.
and
once
they
had
been
established
by
the
contract,
they
would
continue
after
the
termination.
mr.
arnold
ordman
and
that
under
the
contract,
because
it's
a
term
and
condition
of
employment
which
had
--
which
had
--
once
established
by
the
contract,
continues
to
exist
and
cannot
be
unilaterally
changed.
mr.
arnold
ordman
any
more
of
them
for
example
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
think
the
court,
the
board
would
still
reach
the
same
conclusion.
for
example,
if
he
elected
for
the
first
time,
with
no
background,
if
he
elected
to
make
vacation
payments
to
employees
who
did
not
strike
and
withheld
them
from
employees
who
did
strike,
then
the
discrimination
would
be
apparent
on
its
face
even
in
that
situation.
he
may
not
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
these,
i
suppose,
within
the
board's,
the
discretion,
i
suppose
would
be
a
matter
whether
to
set
things
right.
it
should
be
make
payments
to
the
employees,
to
the
strikers,
possibly
withholding
from
the
nonstrikers
but
i
don't
conceive
the
latter
continues.
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
i
think
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
and
i
think
there
would
be
no
8
(a)
(3)
violations
as
i
see
it.
there
may
well,
however,
has
been
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation
because
this
would
be
a
unilateral
change
of
a
working
condition
and
this
court
has
established
the
working
conditions
having
been
established
by
the
contract
even
though
the
contract
expired,
the
working
conditions
like
the
wages
in
hours
would
continue.
the
employers
would
not
unilaterally
change
them
and
if
he
did,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
his
bargaining
application.
but
it
would
not
be
an
8
(a)
(3).
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
it
could
be.
that
could
be
an
action
under
301
under
the
contract.
yes.
now,
we
suggest
therefore
--
now,
we
are
not
saying
that
this
is
the
end
of
thing.
the
discriminatory
intent
is
established,
of
course,
by
the
nature
of
the
conduct
itself.
but
this
court
has
suggested
in
erie
resistor
there
are
countervailing
considerations;
there
could
be
a
legitimate
motive,
a
legitimate
objective
which
would
overweigh
the
discriminatory
intent.
now,
without
dwelling
on
it
too
much,
i
simply
say
that
there
are
cases
and
we
have
cited
some
of
these
illustrative
situations
on
page
12
of
our
brief
where
a
legitimate
business
consideration
can
override
the
discriminatory
intent
which
is
inherent
in
the
conduct.
but
certainly,
the
company
presented
none
as
the
board
below
found.
and
even
assuming
that
the
court
as
it
did
itself
speculate
as
to
what
might
have
been
the
reason
and
it
supplied
this
reasons,
the
company
did
not.
we
suggest
that
even
that
--
even
if
that
were
proper,
the
speculative
reasons
the
court
below
assigned
don't
carry
the
ball
because
this
board
--
the
board
did
weigh
these
considerations
and
in
its
judgment
under
this
court
whether
that
judgment
is
certainly
subject
to
the
review
by
the
courts
and
by
this
court.
but
this
court
has
suggested
that
there
must
be
a
little
circumspection
attending
court
review
of
that
judgment.
now,
we
find
nothing
in
american
ship
which
is
inconsistent
with
erie
resistor
and
we
think
to
the
extent
this
court
mentioned
the
erie
resistor
principle
in
american
ship
and
it
did
cite
that
case
for
we
think
it
specifically
indorsed
erie
resistor.
now,
the
bulk
of
the
respondent's
argument
here
really
is
that
the
impact
of
vacation
pay,
this
case
is
different
from
erie
resistor
because
the
impact
of
withholding
vacation
pay
benefits
even
though
a
term
and
condition
applied.
mr.
arnold
ordman
wasn't
as
--
excuse
me.
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
but
apparently
everybody
was
working
for
the
company,
did
not
go
on
strike,
received
vacation
pay.
now
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
provided
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
people
who
came
back
after
that
did
not
get
payments,
did
not
get
paid.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
now,
the
burden
of
respondent's
argument
really
is
that
the
impact
of
what
the
company
did
in
this
case
was
not
as
serious
as
the
impact
of
super
seniority
in
the
erie
resistor
case
and
i
think
we
might,
without
prejudice
even
make
this
concession.
but
then,
it
is
again
a
question
of
balancing
because
equally
true
that
on
the
converse
side,
the
employer
in
erie
resistor
would
make
and
did
make
a
very
cogent
case
which
this
court
assumed
that
he
simply
couldn't
stand
business
unless
he
gave
that
super
seniority
to
offer
that
super
seniority
to
replacements.
now,
as
i
say
in
this
case,
we
think
no
serious
business
exigency
to
suggest
except
possibly
the
saving
of
money
which
would
necessitate
the
action
of
the
employer
who
took
here
in
derogation
of
the
right
to
strike
which
this
court
has
said
carry
some
sort
of
special
safeguard.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
right.
if
--
if
he
--
if
he
has
made
in
fact
the
mistake
of
law
let's
us
assume
this
alright
or
whatever
it
--
if
in
law
his
action
necessarily
discriminates
against
strikers
versus
nonstrikers
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
--
he
must
be
taken
to
have
intended
this
discriminatory
effect.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
if
he
initiates
a
term
and
condition
of
employment.
and
it
is
a
term
and
condition
of
employment,
he
cannot
apply
it
discriminatory
as
between
strikers
and
nonstrikers.
then
he
has
penalizing
people
for
exercising
their
lawful
right
to
strike.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
ordman
only
two
very
brief
comments.
i
don't
know
whether
inadvertently
an
impression
might
have
been
created
that
there
was
bargaining
about
this
unilateral
vacation
plan.
the
record
is
flat
and
the
testimony
by
the
--
in
page
63
of
the
record
by
harvey
granger,
who
was
a
plant
manager,
“do
you
recall,
mr.
granger
if
vacation
pay
was
ever
discussed
in
the
bargaining
sessions
with
the
union
after
the
union
that
cancelled
the
contract?”
answer,
“it
was
not.”
the
only
other
thing
i
might
just
touch
briefly
on
the
most
recent
question
about
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
sir.
i
want
to
touch
just
briefly
on
the
last
question
about
the
effects.
i
think
i
pointed
out
that
we
might
get
out
prejudiced,
concede
that
the
impact
in
super
seniority
was
not
in
the
super
seniority
case
probably
greater
than
it
is
in
this
case
but
there
certainly
is
in
effect
on
the
strikers
or
employees
who
are
aware
and
will
be
aware
in
the
future
that
if
they
--
unless
they
proffered
their
right
to
strike,
they
may
be
endangered
in
the
future
if
they
strike.
they
might
be
endangered
of
losing
benefits
that
would
otherwise
accrue
to
them
if
they
didn't
strike
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
sir.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
ordman
as
we
see
this
case
in
the
balancing
consideration
that
this
court
talked
about
in
the
erie
resistor,
the
weights
on
both
sides
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
--
are
correspondingly
less
but
it
must
be
viewed
in
that
context.
