do
you
really
care
whether
the
statute
is
involved
here
or

justice
byron

white
i
know
you
think
but
why
do
you
care
whether
it
is
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
only
reason
you
care
about
that
is
you
want
the
case
here
and
you
want
to
decide
it.
what
if
somebody
said,
we'll
repeat
the
certiorari
--
the
cert?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
statute
doesn't
add
anything
to
the
warning,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there
was
no
statute
at
all
and
the
same
thing
happen,
assuming
no
statute,
there
was
no
reference
to
--
assume
no
new
jersey
statute
on
the
question
of
at

the
district
attorney
just
called
the
police
officer,
he'd
be
fired
if
he
didn't
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
isn't
that
your
argument
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know
but
it
doesn't
add
anything
to
what
to
the
district
attorney's
statement.
you
know
this
is
good
argument
if
there
wasn't
a
new
jersey
statute
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
relied
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
new
jersey
supreme
court
can
testify.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
put
it
this
way,
the
reversal
in
this
case
doesn't
depend
on
our
finding
of
the
new
jersey
statute
was
involved
and
was
upheld.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
its
(voice
overlap)
if
you
would
be
willing
to
say
that
if
the
statute
doesn't
--
we
don't
think
the
statute
is
involved
which
you
referred.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
to
the
interest
of
your
client
be
added
to
detected
if
all
there's
a
court
rule
was
any
evidence
is
obtained
and
this
method
--
by
this
method
is
inadmissible
at
the
trial.
you
just
can't
(voice
overlap)
this
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you're
complaining
that
this
man
has
been
convicted
by
the
use
of
evidence
that
was
coerced.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
we
take
you
at
your
wording
say
yes
there
was
coercion
here.
this
conviction
is
reversed,
that's
all
you've
asked
us
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
do
you
think
it's
critical
for
their
argument
to
the
state?
they
may
say
so
but
what
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
new
jersey
court
ruled
the
context,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
statute
wasn't
invoked
or
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
handler,
then
i
take
it
you're
distinguishing
the
police
officer
from
the
ordinary
citizen
who
might
be
interrogated
by
the
police
or
by
the
district
attorney
and
hold
that
now
come
on
you
better
fellas
or
we
will
get
you
fired
and
we
will
follow
up
you
boss
then
we
can
pretty
well
make
sure
that
he
won't
be
working
tomorrow
and
that
you
(inaudible)
information.
well,
you
wouldn't
compass
that
as
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
policeman
is
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
isn't,
why
there's
coercion?
justice
byron
r.

you
really
do
want
to
argue
the
statute
here
through
the
course
of
--
justice
byron

mr.

i
gather
that
if
the
police
should
be
required
to
answer
question
putting
in
by
the
district
attorney
whereas
an
ordinary
citizen
wouldn't,
why
