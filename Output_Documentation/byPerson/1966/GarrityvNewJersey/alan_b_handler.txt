mr.
alan
b.
handler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
the
relative
shortness
of
time,
i
would
propose
to
emphasize
the
argument
that
the
admission
of
a
testimony
of
the
appellants
was
a
violation
of
due
process.
and
the
course
of
that
argument
i
would
hope
to
make
clear
that
i
think
that
this
court
lacks
appellate
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
last
point
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes,
and
i
certainly
cannot
be
dogmatic
in
saying
that
it's
not
an
important
--
an
importance
of
statute.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
this
is
what
i
propose
to
do
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
of
course
i
can
see
that
the
appellant's
consider
it
essential
to
their
argument
that
the
statute
2
(a)
8117.1
be
considered
as
involved.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
it
is
involved
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
it
does
color
their
arguments
significantly
and
i
think
without
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
without
the
force
and
effect
of
that
statute,
i
think
that
the
court
must
then
consider
whether
or
not
as
a
factual
matter
there
was
coercion
and
the
interrogation
such
as
to
vitiate
a
subsequent
testimony.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
would
agree
with
that.
that
would
be
the
situation
which
the
constitutionality
statute
would
be
involved
directly,
but
the
appellants
conceived
that
this
statute
being
on
the
books
was
impliedly
invoked
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
the
course
of
the
interrogation
and
by
that
implied
invocation
of
the
statute.
the
result
and
testimony
was
coerced.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
the
new
jersey
court
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct
and
the
new
jersey
court
stated
in
effect
that
the
advice
or
warning
given
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
was
merely
reflective
of
the
intrinsic
duty
in
the
laws
applicable
to
police
officers.
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
reading
the
warnings
given
by
these
--
to
these
various
appellants,
my
adversary
of
course
reads
the
warning
given
to
mr.
holroyd
and
which
the
deputy
attorney
general
says
that
under
a
statute
he
may
be
subject
to
removal.
with
respect
to
each
of
the
other
appellants,
he
merely
stated
that
as
a
police
officer
under
the
laws
you
may
be
subject
to
a
proceeding
to
have
you
removed
from
office
with
respect
to
mrs.
naglee,
now
deceased,
of
course
no
warning
whatsoever
was
given.
moreover,
more
than
a
year
later
when
the
investigation
was
being
conducted
by
the
county
prosecutor,
the
assistant
prosecutor
didn't
mention
the
possibility
of
removal
at
all.
now,
the
gist
of
the
case
in
accordance
with
the
new
jersey
supreme
court's
decision
is
that
this
advice
or
this
warning
was
reflective
of
the
law
applicable
to
police
officers
and
as
such
the
warning
was
reasonable,
it
was
fair
and
it
was
accurate.
and
therefore
will
lead
to
an
analysis
as
to
whether
if
this
warning
was
reflective
of
the
law
applicable
to
police
officers
whether
that
law
itself
is
valid
and
sound
and
reasonable.
and
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
for
this
court
and
i
don't
think
the
appellants
so
urged
that
a
police
officer
who
was
asked
to
cooperate
or
testify
in
the
course
of
an
official
proceeding
relating
to
his
official
duties
is
under
a
duty
to
cooperate.
now,
none
would
quarrel
that
it
is
a
primary
function
and
duty
of
a
police
officer
to
detect
and
prevent
crime
and
such
detection
of
course
involved
disclosure
and
if
a
police
officer
fail
to
report
or
disclose
the
commission
of
a
crime
involving
third
persons
everyone
would
have
to
agree
that
this
would
be
a
horrendous
dereliction
of
duty.
and
it
would
be
equally
so
if
the
crime
have
been
committed
by
a
member
of
a
policeman's
family.
as
a
matter
of
fact
recently
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
we
had
a
situation
where
a
local
policeman
had
to
arrest
his
nephew
with
respect
to
a
homicide.
and
so
there
is
this
transcending
duty
on
a
part
of
a
police
officer
to
make
whole
disclosure
to
detect
crime,
to
report
crime.
is
there
then
a
carved
out
exception
with
respect
to
fulfilling
this
duty
when
it
comes
to
a
police
officer
himself.
when
he
himself
has
been
involved
or
suspected
as
having
been
involved
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
and
of
course
i
think
the
answer
follows
that
merely
because
a
police
officer
individually
is
involved,
he
is
no
wise
redeemed
of
his
official
duty
to
disclose
crime
and
to
cooperate
and
to
testify
if
this
is
part
of
what
is
necessary
to
prosecute
crime
effectively.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
not
at
all.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
believe
a
policeman
is
different
and
i
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
if
he
is
not,
there
is
coercion.
now,
i
could
well
anticipate
that
other
public
employees
may
not
be
similarly
situated.
it
is
conceivable
for
example
that
if
a
state
highway
maintenance
employee
is
interrogated
with
respect
to
gambling
or
bookmaking
or
some
other
type
of
crime
that
perhaps
the
same
compulsions
or
the
same
duties
cannot
be
super
imposed
upon
him.
it
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
duty
to
cooperate,
the
duty
to
disclose
crime
and
once
possible
implication
in
crime
is
an
inherent
part
of
the
function
of
the
particular
public
employee.
now,
of
course
appellants
understandably
lost
over
any
possible
distinction
between
a
police
officer
and
a
private
citizen
and
they
retreat
to
the
generalities
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
everybody
and
therefore
it
should
apply
uncritically
to
everybody
regardless
of
the
circumstances
and
regardless
of
the
context.
i
don't
think
that's
so
when
there
are
decisions
that
have
held
that
with
respect
to
grant
of
particular
types
of
privileges.
there
may
be
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
and
reasonably
regulation
curtailments
of
constitutional
privileges
such
as
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
inquiry
is
not
whether
or
not
this
is
an
encroachment
on
the
fifth
amendment
but
whether
or
not
the
limitation
is
in
itself
reasonable
whether
it's
designed
to
accomplish
a
reasonable
end.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
go
quite
that
far
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
say
that
a
policeman
can
be
honor
a
duty
to
give
evidence
against
himself
in
a
proper
proceeding.
but
he
cannot
be
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
he
can
be
forced
to
give
such
evidence.
i
don't
think
he
can
be
compelled
to
but
i
think
that
the
state
is
not
left
remedy
less
against
a
policeman
who
fails
to
perform
that
duty.
i
think
a
state
may
remove
him
from
office
at
the
very
least.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no,
because
i
feel
this
that
the
statute
is
on
the
books.
if
that
statute
were
construed
and
applied
to
literally
i
concede
that
we'd
have
difficulty
under
the
slochower
decision
but
even
in
the
lava
case
cited
by
my
adversary,
there
was
a
remand
in
the
lava
case
because
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
stated
that
a
teacher
could
not
be
dismissed
simply
for
refusing
to
answer
--
to
answer
questions
relating
to
past
communist
membership
and
affiliation
that
the
slochower
decision
required
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
it
required
a
proceeding
directed
towards
the
fitness
of
the
teacher
to
hold
the
office.
and
so,
the
statute
in
that
sense
to
the
extent
there
was
involved
in
the
lava
case
has
been
given
this
construction
and
this
interpretation
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
of
course
it
is
the
statute
as
understood
and
construed
by
the
state
court
which
is
persuasive
of
this
court's
view
of
the
state
law.
and
in
this
case
itself,
the
court
stated
without
particular
reference
to
the
statute
that
a
policeman
may
be
subject
to
removal
for
refusal
to
answer
question
and
an
official
proceeding
relating
to
his
official
acts
but
he
can
only
be
so
removed
in
an
appropriate
proceeding
with
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
if
it
is
disclosed
as
a
result
of
that
proceeding
that
his
failure
to
testify
and
cooperate
just
speaks
of
a
want
of
fitness
to
be
a
policeman.
and
so,
it
is
of
that
law
which
assert
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
say
that
categorically
but
i
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
say
it
may
be.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
this
court
has
held
that
the
mere
refusal
to
testify
does
not
in
it
of
itself
give
rise
to
a
basis
for
removal
and
i
don't
argue
with
that
articulation.
i
think
what
is
germane
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
they're
could
conceivably
be
in
excuse
for
example
even
in
this
very
proceeding.
the
plaintiff
of
the
appellant
is
not
wholly
lacking
in
sympathy.
they
were
part
of
a
practice
which
had
grown
up
of
ticket
fixing
which
at
this
particular
point
in
time
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
had
become
right.
they
were
not
as
one
reason
of
record
morally
reprehensible
individuals
if
they
had
refused
to
testify,
i
would
say
that
their
local
governing
bodies
would
be
well
within
their
discretion
in
dismissing
them
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
it
would
have
been
abuse
of
discretion
merely
to
suspend
them
or
to
impose
some
other
type
of
discipline
upon
them.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
in
this
circumstance,
i
think
so.
they
would
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
not
necessarily
so,
not
necessarily
so
because
in
the
situation
which
you're
hypothesizing
they
have
not
been
required
to
testify
against
themselves.
they
have
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
and
refuse
to
testify
and
in
a
circumstance
like
that
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
if
they're
not
put
between
the
devil
and
deep
blue
sea,
it
means
an
effect
that
society
is
because
it
would
mean
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
i
don't
think
that's
a
sweet
in
effect
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
don't
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
require
that
society
continue
in
public
employment,
a
policeman
who
was
unwilling
to
cooperate
in
an
investigation
relating
to
his
own
possible
criminal
activities
just
as
it
seem
to
make
sense.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
that
is
basically
the
only
issue.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
involved.
the
--
in
point
of
fact,
this
is
extra
record,
i
think
three
of
these
appellants
have
been
dismissed
i
think
in
another
municipality
they
are
merely
suspended
from
the
force
but
they're
holding
other
public
jobs
pending
the
outcome
of
the
appeal
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
the
way
i
see
the
issue
in
this
case.
that
is
so
main
issue
in
the
case
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
the
appellants
volunteered
them.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
factually,
this
is
what
happened.
shortly,
prior
to
the
order
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
requiring
an
investigation
an
official
or
an
officer
of
the
office
of
the
administrative
director
as
a
result
of
an
audit
made
in
these
municipalities
reported
to
the
supreme
court
the
apparent
irregularities
in
the
handling
of
municipal
motor
vehicle
tickets.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
many,
many
years
this
has
been
a
function
long
exercise
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
as
a
result
of
this,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
ordered
the
attorney
general
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
these
alleged
irregularities.
a
deputy
attorney
general
was
deputized
or
directed
by
the
attorney
general
to
conduct
the
investigation.
he
communicated
with
each
of
these
appellants,
setup
dates
for
hearings
and
examinations.
he
had
the
same
time
had
other
investigations
conducted
in
these
municipalities.
three
of
the
appellants
i
want
to
point
out
had
counsel.
one
of
the
other
appellants,
chief
garrity
indicated
he
had
counsel
but
didn't
want
to
bring
him
along
because
he
didn't
think
it
was
necessary.
the
deputy
attorney
general
went
down
to
the
municipalities.
he
set
up
the
hearings
and
the
hearings
were
conducted.
and
a
course
of
the
hearings
preliminarily,
he
advised
them
very
clearly
that
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
into
the
alleged
irregularities
in
the
handling
of
tickets.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
didn't
say
specifically
for
their
doing
it
but
i
think
it's
reasonably
clear
that
each
of
them
knew
he
was
involved.
it
was
after
all
the
interrogation
of
the
police
officers
who
had
issued
the
tickets,
who
had
acted
as
violations
clerk
on
a
part-time
basis,
the
chief
of
police
in
one
of
the
municipalities
and
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
didn't
say
it
would
be
but
he
made
a
quite
clear
that
their
testimony
could
be
used
against
them
or
any
other
person
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding
and
this
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
told
them
that
if
they
refuse
to
testify
as
police
officers
they
may
be
subject
to
proceedings
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
that's
true
but
they
also
were
being
interrogated
in
connection
with
the
alleged
commission
of
crime
within
their
jurisdiction
and
as
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
and
the
advice
to
them
was
that
as
police
officers
they
might
be
subject
to
removal
proceedings
if
they
refuse
to
testify.
now,
it's
our
position
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
feel
this
that
the
advice
given
to
these
appellants
was
no
more
no
less
than
what
they
were
subject
to
them,
and
what
they
were
obligated
to
do
as
policemen
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
of
course
you
assume
your
conclusion
by
saying
that
a
priority
that
fifth
amendment
prevents
the
discharge
of
this
duty.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
i
don't
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
if
the
threat
has
no
grounding
in
law
or
in
policy
then
the
fifth
amendment
does
act
as
a
foreign.
but
if
a
man
is
under
a
legal
duty
to
cooperate
and
to
testify
by
virtue
of
his
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
he
can.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
he
can
because
it
is
his
decision
to
make.
he
can
still
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
and
state
i
am
not
going
to
testify.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
he
may
lose
his
job.
now,
appellants
argued
that
this
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to
arrest.
they're
between
the
rock
and
the
whirlpool,
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
yes,
it
does
in
my
mind
and
i
don't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
what
we
argued
with
respect
to
a
police
officer
would
necessarily
apply
to
every
type
of
public
employee.
this,
i
don't
know
but
a
police
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
the
question
of
discharges
is
pertinent
mr.
justice
fortas
because
in
point
of
fact
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
status
of
these
appellants
is
in
each
of
their
municipalities.
i
think
that
some
are
still
holding
some
public
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
judgments
of
conviction.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
this
argument
of
course
has
been
tendered.
i
don't
subscribe
to
look
because
i
don't
agree
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
given
by
appellants.
the
statute
has
been
interpreted
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
the
lava
case
and
in
this
case,
and
the
court
of
new
jersey
makes
it
very
clear
that
this
statute
cannot
be
invoked
except
within
the
perimeter
of
slochower.
in
other
words,
they
cannot
be
an
automatic
or
mandatory
forfeiture.
there
must
be
a
hearing
relating
to
fitness
for
office.
i
also
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
that
there
is
another
statute
in
new
jersey
njsa
40:69
(a)
167
which
provides
that
failure
to
testify
may
be
grounds
for
removal
on
the
part
of
a
municipal
body
in
its
discretion.
now,
that
of
course
is
applicable
with
respect
to
municipalities
that
under
that
particular
form
of
government
but
it
is
not
the
policy
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
that
there
can
be
automatic
mandatory
dismissal
upon
the
bare
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
a
part
of
a
public
employee.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes,
it's
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
o'connor
with
all
due
respects
keeps
harking
back
to
the
statute
as
literally
written
without
a
sensible
appreciation
for
the
manner
in
which
that
statute
has
been
construed
and
the
manner
in
which
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
this
case
has
articulated
the
law
of
discharge
with
respect
to
police
officers.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
it
would
be
different
and
i
think
that
is
that
this
case
because
each
appellant
was
surprised
clearly
that
he
might
be
subject
to
removal
not
that
he
would
be
removed.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no,
i
think
at
a
hearing
he
would
be
forced
to
in
response
to
questions
to
disclose
the
circumstances
and
the
basis
upon
which
he's
refusing
to
testify.
i
think
he
could
urge
that
the
questions
put
to
him
were
not
reasonably
related
to
his
qualifications
for
office
such
as
remote
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
things
like
that.
i
think
that's
what
would
be
the
basis
of
a
disciplinary
hearing
but
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
he
could
be
called
to
testify,
i
don't
think
he
could
be
compelled
to
testify
if
for
example
you
had
a
situation
where
a
defendant
police
officer
was
called
to
the
stand
and
he
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
this
might
raise
an
interesting
point
as
to
whether
he
would
be
subject
to
disciplinary
removal
for
failing
to
testify
in
the
course
of
a
trial
and
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
that
result
could
obtain.
i
think
it
could
obtain
if
he
was
called
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
as
oppose
to
this
type
of
investigation.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
assuming
that
there
would
be
independent
evidence
upon
which
to
proceed
with
his
criminal
trial.
yes,
i
think
so
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
of
the
cases
which
constitute
the
literature
in
this
field
concerning
the
discharge
of
public
employees
and
police
officers
in
particular
involved
proceedings
before
a
civil
service
commission
or
another
governmental
agency
having
jurisdiction
over
employment
where
the
refusal
to
testify
is
made
in
the
course
of
the
disciplinary
proceeding
and
it's
predicated
on
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
the
callahan
case
is
one
example
of
that
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
i
gave
as
an
example
of
possible
non-applicability
the
highway
maintenance
employee
will
feels
potholes
on
a
public
road.
i'm
not
certain
that
he
has
a
duty
as
a
part
of
his
official
position
to
detect
and
prevent
crime
as
does
a
policeman
and
this
type
of
proceedings
and
this
type
of
warning
with
respect
to
an
employee
such
as
that
may
not
be
proper.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
it
would
probably
be
under
statutes
and
civil
service
regulations
which
generally
permit
dismissal
for
conduct
unbecoming
employees,
dishonorable
conduct
and
standard
such
as
that
which
i'm
sure
most
states
have.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i'm
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
the
--
i'm
not
certain
that
this
statute
was
specifically
applied
in
the
teacher
cases
in
new
jersey,
lava
and
lowenstein
because
there
was
a
statute
under
title
18
which
is
the
education
act
which
permitted
dismissal
of
teachers
for
conduct
unbecoming.
and
it
was
their
failure
to
testify
which
invoked
those
statutes
and
even
in
the
fram
(ph)
case
cited
in
our
brief
where
there
was
a
loss
of
a
pension.
there
was
the
pension
statute
that
provided
for
forfeiture
of
pension
rights
for
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no.
there
was
merely
the
general
standards
that
there
could
be
a
lost
of
pension
rights
for
dishonorable
service
and
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
fade,
well,
in
that
case
to
be
accurate.
there
was
a
conviction
for
ticket
fixing
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
for
ticket
fixing
in
the
fram
(ph)
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
i
was
held
to
be
dishonorable
service
and
resulted
in
a
loss
of
a
state
pension.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
excuse
me.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i'm
not
certain
in
that
case
whether
there
was
independent
evidence.
i
will
rely
on
our
brief
with
respect
to
the
other
issues.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
we
did
not
argue
the
point
of
independent
substantial
evidence.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
printed
appendix
or
the
printed
record
does
not
constitute
the
entire
record
that
was
before
new
jersey's
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
frankly
have
not
evaluated
the
other
testimony
that
would
permit
me
to
reach
your
conclusion.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
the
relative
shortness
of
time,
i
would
propose
to
emphasize
the
argument
that
the
admission
of
a
testimony
of
the
appellants
was
a
violation
of
due
process.
and
the
course
of
that
argument
i
would
hope
to
make
clear
that
i
think
that
this
court
lacks
appellate
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
last
point
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes,
and
i
certainly
cannot
be
dogmatic
in
saying
that
it's
not
an
important
--
an
importance
of
statute.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
this
is
what
i
propose
to
do
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
of
course
i
can
see
that
the
appellant's
consider
it
essential
to
their
argument
that
the
statute
2
(a)
8117.1
be
considered
as
involved.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
it
is
involved
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
it
does
color
their
arguments
significantly
and
i
think
without
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
without
the
force
and
effect
of
that
statute,
i
think
that
the
court
must
then
consider
whether
or
not
as
a
factual
matter
there
was
coercion
and
the
interrogation
such
as
to
vitiate
a
subsequent
testimony.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
would
agree
with
that.
that
would
be
the
situation
which
the
constitutionality
statute
would
be
involved
directly,
but
the
appellants
conceived
that
this
statute
being
on
the
books
was
impliedly
invoked
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
the
course
of
the
interrogation
and
by
that
implied
invocation
of
the
statute.
the
result
and
testimony
was
coerced.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
the
new
jersey
court
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
correct
and
the
new
jersey
court
stated
in
effect
that
the
advice
or
warning
given
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
was
merely
reflective
of
the
intrinsic
duty
in
the
laws
applicable
to
police
officers.
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
reading
the
warnings
given
by
these
--
to
these
various
appellants,
my
adversary
of
course
reads
the
warning
given
to
mr.
holroyd
and
which
the
deputy
attorney
general
says
that
under
a
statute
he
may
be
subject
to
removal.
with
respect
to
each
of
the
other
appellants,
he
merely
stated
that
as
a
police
officer
under
the
laws
you
may
be
subject
to
a
proceeding
to
have
you
removed
from
office
with
respect
to
mrs.
naglee,
now
deceased,
of
course
no
warning
whatsoever
was
given.
moreover,
more
than
a
year
later
when
the
investigation
was
being
conducted
by
the
county
prosecutor,
the
assistant
prosecutor
didn't
mention
the
possibility
of
removal
at
all.
now,
the
gist
of
the
case
in
accordance
with
the
new
jersey
supreme
court's
decision
is
that
this
advice
or
this
warning
was
reflective
of
the
law
applicable
to
police
officers
and
as
such
the
warning
was
reasonable,
it
was
fair
and
it
was
accurate.
and
therefore
will
lead
to
an
analysis
as
to
whether
if
this
warning
was
reflective
of
the
law
applicable
to
police
officers
whether
that
law
itself
is
valid
and
sound
and
reasonable.
and
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
for
this
court
and
i
don't
think
the
appellants
so
urged
that
a
police
officer
who
was
asked
to
cooperate
or
testify
in
the
course
of
an
official
proceeding
relating
to
his
official
duties
is
under
a
duty
to
cooperate.
now,
none
would
quarrel
that
it
is
a
primary
function
and
duty
of
a
police
officer
to
detect
and
prevent
crime
and
such
detection
of
course
involved
disclosure
and
if
a
police
officer
fail
to
report
or
disclose
the
commission
of
a
crime
involving
third
persons
everyone
would
have
to
agree
that
this
would
be
a
horrendous
dereliction
of
duty.
and
it
would
be
equally
so
if
the
crime
have
been
committed
by
a
member
of
a
policeman's
family.
as
a
matter
of
fact
recently
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
we
had
a
situation
where
a
local
policeman
had
to
arrest
his
nephew
with
respect
to
a
homicide.
and
so
there
is
this
transcending
duty
on
a
part
of
a
police
officer
to
make
whole
disclosure
to
detect
crime,
to
report
crime.
is
there
then
a
carved
out
exception
with
respect
to
fulfilling
this
duty
when
it
comes
to
a
police
officer
himself.
when
he
himself
has
been
involved
or
suspected
as
having
been
involved
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
and
of
course
i
think
the
answer
follows
that
merely
because
a
police
officer
individually
is
involved,
he
is
no
wise
redeemed
of
his
official
duty
to
disclose
crime
and
to
cooperate
and
to
testify
if
this
is
part
of
what
is
necessary
to
prosecute
crime
effectively.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
not
at
all.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
believe
a
policeman
is
different
and
i
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
if
he
is
not,
there
is
coercion.
now,
i
could
well
anticipate
that
other
public
employees
may
not
be
similarly
situated.
it
is
conceivable
for
example
that
if
a
state
highway
maintenance
employee
is
interrogated
with
respect
to
gambling
or
bookmaking
or
some
other
type
of
crime
that
perhaps
the
same
compulsions
or
the
same
duties
cannot
be
super
imposed
upon
him.
it
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
duty
to
cooperate,
the
duty
to
disclose
crime
and
once
possible
implication
in
crime
is
an
inherent
part
of
the
function
of
the
particular
public
employee.
now,
of
course
appellants
understandably
lost
over
any
possible
distinction
between
a
police
officer
and
a
private
citizen
and
they
retreat
to
the
generalities
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
everybody
and
therefore
it
should
apply
uncritically
to
everybody
regardless
of
the
circumstances
and
regardless
of
the
context.
i
don't
think
that's
so
when
there
are
decisions
that
have
held
that
with
respect
to
grant
of
particular
types
of
privileges.
there
may
be
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
and
reasonably
regulation
curtailments
of
constitutional
privileges
such
as
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
inquiry
is
not
whether
or
not
this
is
an
encroachment
on
the
fifth
amendment
but
whether
or
not
the
limitation
is
in
itself
reasonable
whether
it's
designed
to
accomplish
a
reasonable
end.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
go
quite
that
far
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
say
that
a
policeman
can
be
honor
a
duty
to
give
evidence
against
himself
in
a
proper
proceeding.
but
he
cannot
be
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
he
can
be
forced
to
give
such
evidence.
i
don't
think
he
can
be
compelled
to
but
i
think
that
the
state
is
not
left
remedy
less
against
a
policeman
who
fails
to
perform
that
duty.
i
think
a
state
may
remove
him
from
office
at
the
very
least.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no,
because
i
feel
this
that
the
statute
is
on
the
books.
if
that
statute
were
construed
and
applied
to
literally
i
concede
that
we'd
have
difficulty
under
the
slochower
decision
but
even
in
the
lava
case
cited
by
my
adversary,
there
was
a
remand
in
the
lava
case
because
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
stated
that
a
teacher
could
not
be
dismissed
simply
for
refusing
to
answer
--
to
answer
questions
relating
to
past
communist
membership
and
affiliation
that
the
slochower
decision
required
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
it
required
a
proceeding
directed
towards
the
fitness
of
the
teacher
to
hold
the
office.
and
so,
the
statute
in
that
sense
to
the
extent
there
was
involved
in
the
lava
case
has
been
given
this
construction
and
this
interpretation
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
of
course
it
is
the
statute
as
understood
and
construed
by
the
state
court
which
is
persuasive
of
this
court's
view
of
the
state
law.
and
in
this
case
itself,
the
court
stated
without
particular
reference
to
the
statute
that
a
policeman
may
be
subject
to
removal
for
refusal
to
answer
question
and
an
official
proceeding
relating
to
his
official
acts
but
he
can
only
be
so
removed
in
an
appropriate
proceeding
with
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
if
it
is
disclosed
as
a
result
of
that
proceeding
that
his
failure
to
testify
and
cooperate
just
speaks
of
a
want
of
fitness
to
be
a
policeman.
and
so,
it
is
of
that
law
which
assert
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
say
that
categorically
but
i
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
say
it
may
be.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
this
court
has
held
that
the
mere
refusal
to
testify
does
not
in
it
of
itself
give
rise
to
a
basis
for
removal
and
i
don't
argue
with
that
articulation.
i
think
what
is
germane
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
they're
could
conceivably
be
in
excuse
for
example
even
in
this
very
proceeding.
the
plaintiff
of
the
appellant
is
not
wholly
lacking
in
sympathy.
they
were
part
of
a
practice
which
had
grown
up
of
ticket
fixing
which
at
this
particular
point
in
time
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
had
become
right.
they
were
not
as
one
reason
of
record
morally
reprehensible
individuals
if
they
had
refused
to
testify,
i
would
say
that
their
local
governing
bodies
would
be
well
within
their
discretion
in
dismissing
them
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
it
would
have
been
abuse
of
discretion
merely
to
suspend
them
or
to
impose
some
other
type
of
discipline
upon
them.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
in
this
circumstance,
i
think
so.
they
would
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
not
necessarily
so,
not
necessarily
so
because
in
the
situation
which
you're
hypothesizing
they
have
not
been
required
to
testify
against
themselves.
they
have
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
and
refuse
to
testify
and
in
a
circumstance
like
that
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
if
they're
not
put
between
the
devil
and
deep
blue
sea,
it
means
an
effect
that
society
is
because
it
would
mean
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
i
don't
think
that's
a
sweet
in
effect
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
don't
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
require
that
society
continue
in
public
employment,
a
policeman
who
was
unwilling
to
cooperate
in
an
investigation
relating
to
his
own
possible
criminal
activities
just
as
it
seem
to
make
sense.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
that
is
basically
the
only
issue.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
involved.
the
--
in
point
of
fact,
this
is
extra
record,
i
think
three
of
these
appellants
have
been
dismissed
i
think
in
another
municipality
they
are
merely
suspended
from
the
force
but
they're
holding
other
public
jobs
pending
the
outcome
of
the
appeal
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
that
is
the
way
i
see
the
issue
in
this
case.
that
is
so
main
issue
in
the
case
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
that
the
appellants
volunteered
them.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
factually,
this
is
what
happened.
shortly,
prior
to
the
order
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
requiring
an
investigation
an
official
or
an
officer
of
the
office
of
the
administrative
director
as
a
result
of
an
audit
made
in
these
municipalities
reported
to
the
supreme
court
the
apparent
irregularities
in
the
handling
of
municipal
motor
vehicle
tickets.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
many,
many
years
this
has
been
a
function
long
exercise
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
as
a
result
of
this,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
ordered
the
attorney
general
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
these
alleged
irregularities.
a
deputy
attorney
general
was
deputized
or
directed
by
the
attorney
general
to
conduct
the
investigation.
he
communicated
with
each
of
these
appellants,
setup
dates
for
hearings
and
examinations.
he
had
the
same
time
had
other
investigations
conducted
in
these
municipalities.
three
of
the
appellants
i
want
to
point
out
had
counsel.
one
of
the
other
appellants,
chief
garrity
indicated
he
had
counsel
but
didn't
want
to
bring
him
along
because
he
didn't
think
it
was
necessary.
the
deputy
attorney
general
went
down
to
the
municipalities.
he
set
up
the
hearings
and
the
hearings
were
conducted.
and
a
course
of
the
hearings
preliminarily,
he
advised
them
very
clearly
that
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
into
the
alleged
irregularities
in
the
handling
of
tickets.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
didn't
say
specifically
for
their
doing
it
but
i
think
it's
reasonably
clear
that
each
of
them
knew
he
was
involved.
it
was
after
all
the
interrogation
of
the
police
officers
who
had
issued
the
tickets,
who
had
acted
as
violations
clerk
on
a
part-time
basis,
the
chief
of
police
in
one
of
the
municipalities
and
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
didn't
say
it
would
be
but
he
made
a
quite
clear
that
their
testimony
could
be
used
against
them
or
any
other
person
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding
and
this
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
he
told
them
that
if
they
refuse
to
testify
as
police
officers
they
may
be
subject
to
proceedings
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
that's
true
but
they
also
were
being
interrogated
in
connection
with
the
alleged
commission
of
crime
within
their
jurisdiction
and
as
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
and
the
advice
to
them
was
that
as
police
officers
they
might
be
subject
to
removal
proceedings
if
they
refuse
to
testify.
now,
it's
our
position
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
feel
this
that
the
advice
given
to
these
appellants
was
no
more
no
less
than
what
they
were
subject
to
them,
and
what
they
were
obligated
to
do
as
policemen
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
of
course
you
assume
your
conclusion
by
saying
that
a
priority
that
fifth
amendment
prevents
the
discharge
of
this
duty.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
i
don't
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
if
the
threat
has
no
grounding
in
law
or
in
policy
then
the
fifth
amendment
does
act
as
a
foreign.
but
if
a
man
is
under
a
legal
duty
to
cooperate
and
to
testify
by
virtue
of
his
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
he
can.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
he
can
because
it
is
his
decision
to
make.
he
can
still
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
and
state
i
am
not
going
to
testify.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
but
he
may
lose
his
job.
now,
appellants
argued
that
this
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to
arrest.
they're
between
the
rock
and
the
whirlpool,
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
yes,
it
does
in
my
mind
and
i
don't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
what
we
argued
with
respect
to
a
police
officer
would
necessarily
apply
to
every
type
of
public
employee.
this,
i
don't
know
but
a
police
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
don't
think
the
question
of
discharges
is
pertinent
mr.
justice
fortas
because
in
point
of
fact
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
status
of
these
appellants
is
in
each
of
their
municipalities.
i
think
that
some
are
still
holding
some
public
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
judgments
of
conviction.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
this
argument
of
course
has
been
tendered.
i
don't
subscribe
to
look
because
i
don't
agree
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
given
by
appellants.
the
statute
has
been
interpreted
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
the
lava
case
and
in
this
case,
and
the
court
of
new
jersey
makes
it
very
clear
that
this
statute
cannot
be
invoked
except
within
the
perimeter
of
slochower.
in
other
words,
they
cannot
be
an
automatic
or
mandatory
forfeiture.
there
must
be
a
hearing
relating
to
fitness
for
office.
i
also
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
that
there
is
another
statute
in
new
jersey
njsa
40:69
(a)
167
which
provides
that
failure
to
testify
may
be
grounds
for
removal
on
the
part
of
a
municipal
body
in
its
discretion.
now,
that
of
course
is
applicable
with
respect
to
municipalities
that
under
that
particular
form
of
government
but
it
is
not
the
policy
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
that
there
can
be
automatic
mandatory
dismissal
upon
the
bare
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
a
part
of
a
public
employee.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes,
it's
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
mr.
o'connor
with
all
due
respects
keeps
harking
back
to
the
statute
as
literally
written
without
a
sensible
appreciation
for
the
manner
in
which
that
statute
has
been
construed
and
the
manner
in
which
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
this
case
has
articulated
the
law
of
discharge
with
respect
to
police
officers.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
it
would
be
different
and
i
think
that
is
that
this
case
because
each
appellant
was
surprised
clearly
that
he
might
be
subject
to
removal
not
that
he
would
be
removed.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no,
i
think
at
a
hearing
he
would
be
forced
to
in
response
to
questions
to
disclose
the
circumstances
and
the
basis
upon
which
he's
refusing
to
testify.
i
think
he
could
urge
that
the
questions
put
to
him
were
not
reasonably
related
to
his
qualifications
for
office
such
as
remote
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
things
like
that.
i
think
that's
what
would
be
the
basis
of
a
disciplinary
hearing
but
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
think
he
could
be
called
to
testify,
i
don't
think
he
could
be
compelled
to
testify
if
for
example
you
had
a
situation
where
a
defendant
police
officer
was
called
to
the
stand
and
he
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
this
might
raise
an
interesting
point
as
to
whether
he
would
be
subject
to
disciplinary
removal
for
failing
to
testify
in
the
course
of
a
trial
and
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
that
result
could
obtain.
i
think
it
could
obtain
if
he
was
called
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
as
oppose
to
this
type
of
investigation.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
assuming
that
there
would
be
independent
evidence
upon
which
to
proceed
with
his
criminal
trial.
yes,
i
think
so
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
of
the
cases
which
constitute
the
literature
in
this
field
concerning
the
discharge
of
public
employees
and
police
officers
in
particular
involved
proceedings
before
a
civil
service
commission
or
another
governmental
agency
having
jurisdiction
over
employment
where
the
refusal
to
testify
is
made
in
the
course
of
the
disciplinary
proceeding
and
it's
predicated
on
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
the
callahan
case
is
one
example
of
that
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
i
gave
as
an
example
of
possible
non-applicability
the
highway
maintenance
employee
will
feels
potholes
on
a
public
road.
i'm
not
certain
that
he
has
a
duty
as
a
part
of
his
official
position
to
detect
and
prevent
crime
as
does
a
policeman
and
this
type
of
proceedings
and
this
type
of
warning
with
respect
to
an
employee
such
as
that
may
not
be
proper.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
it
would
probably
be
under
statutes
and
civil
service
regulations
which
generally
permit
dismissal
for
conduct
unbecoming
employees,
dishonorable
conduct
and
standard
such
as
that
which
i'm
sure
most
states
have.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i'm
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
well,
the
--
i'm
not
certain
that
this
statute
was
specifically
applied
in
the
teacher
cases
in
new
jersey,
lava
and
lowenstein
because
there
was
a
statute
under
title
18
which
is
the
education
act
which
permitted
dismissal
of
teachers
for
conduct
unbecoming.
and
it
was
their
failure
to
testify
which
invoked
those
statutes
and
even
in
the
fram
(ph)
case
cited
in
our
brief
where
there
was
a
loss
of
a
pension.
there
was
the
pension
statute
that
provided
for
forfeiture
of
pension
rights
for
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
no.
there
was
merely
the
general
standards
that
there
could
be
a
lost
of
pension
rights
for
dishonorable
service
and
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
fade,
well,
in
that
case
to
be
accurate.
there
was
a
conviction
for
ticket
fixing
and
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
for
ticket
fixing
in
the
fram
(ph)
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
i
was
held
to
be
dishonorable
service
and
resulted
in
a
loss
of
a
state
pension.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
excuse
me.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i'm
not
certain
in
that
case
whether
there
was
independent
evidence.
i
will
rely
on
our
brief
with
respect
to
the
other
issues.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
we
did
not
argue
the
point
of
independent
substantial
evidence.
mr.
alan
b.
handler
yes.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
printed
appendix
or
the
printed
record
does
not
constitute
the
entire
record
that
was
before
new
jersey's
--
mr.
alan
b.
handler
i
frankly
have
not
evaluated
the
other
testimony
that
would
permit
me
to
reach
your
conclusion.
