mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
which
we
are
considering
now
is
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
there
are
two
cases
which
have
been
consolidated
on
this
appeal
both
of
which
involved
practically
the
same
set
of
facts
and
the
issues
are
identical.
the
cases
below
involved
police
officers
who
were
serving
the
boroughs
of
bellmawr
and
barrington
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
in
the
first
case
below,
the
appellants
garrity
in
virtue
were
indicted,
tried
and
convicted.
there
was
a
third
defendant
in
that
case
a
mrs.
naglee
who
is
not
a
party
to
this
appeal
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
she
was
deceased.
the
second
case
involved
three
police
officers
of
the
borough
of
barrington,
mrs.
holroyd,
elwell,
and
murray.
as
i've
stated
there's
no
basic
dispute
as
to
the
facts
in
the
case
but
because
this
case
was
allowed
by
this
court
and
jurisdiction
--
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
deferred
pending
oral
argument,
i
feel
it
necessary
to
go
into
the
background
before
i
reach
the
argument
on
jurisdiction.
this
case
had
its
inception
in
an
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
dated
june
30,
1961
or
in
it
directed
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
the
practice
of
downgrading
traffic
ticket
violations
in
these
two
boroughs
namely
bellmawr
and
barrington.
both
order
--
the
order
to
investigate
both
boroughs
was
signed
on
the
same
date
and
the
attorney
general
designated
one
of
his
deputies
to
conduct
the
investigation.
during
the
course
of
the
investigation,
it
became
necessary
to
take
oral
testimony
of
the
defendants.
the
new
jersey
in
1953
enacted
a
state
statute
which
became
very
pertinent
in
the
taking
of
the
statements
in
which
is
the
reason
why
we're
here
today.
briefly,
that
statute
provided
it's
denominated
the
generally
is
the
official
conduct
statute
and
statutes
of
this
type
are
not
strangers
to
this
court.
it
provides
briefly,
that
any
person
holding
public
office
who
haven't
been
sworn,
refuses
to
testify
or
to
answer
any
material
question
upon
the
ground
that
his
answer
may
tend
to
incriminate
him
or
compel
him
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
shall
if
holding
public
office
be
removed
that
forfeit
his
office,
position
or
employment
and
any
vested
or
future
right
or
tenure,
and
pensions
granted
to
him.
that
then
goes
on
provide
that
he
shall
not
be
eligible
to
hold
public
office
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
for
ever
after.
now,
prior
to
taking
the
statements
and
after
swearing
the
defendants,
the
investigating
deputy
attorney
general
gave
a
warning
in
which
he
advised
each
defendant
of
his
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
but
explain
to
them
that
if
he
--
if
they
made
a
disclosure
then
they
would
have
to
answer
questions
on
all
other
--
answer
all
other
questions
which
were
asked.
and
then
after
advising
them
of
their
right
not
to
testify,
he
went
on
to
nullify
that
right
by
saying,
“but
because
you
are
police
officers
and
there
is
a
statute
in
this
state
which
requires
you
to
testify
and
if
you
don't
then
you
will
lose
your
jobs.”
now,
that
warning
all
defendants
testified.
they
incriminated
themselves
by
explaining
the
method
of
how
tickets
were
downgraded
and
subsequently
the
state
--
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
attorney
general's
office
referred
the
results
of
the
investigation
to
the
camden
county
prosecutor
for
presentation
of
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
indicted
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
it
was
an
accurate
statement
of
the
law
insofar
as
it
went
and
as
far
as
the
statute
was
concerned,
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that.
in
other
words,
what
he
and
thinks
and
said
what
exactly
what
the
statements
says.
in
other
words,
the
statute
says
that
if
you
refuse
to
testify
and
you
are
holding
public
office
then
you
shall
be
removed
from
office.
the
wording
of
the
--
i'll
read
that
just
a
little
bit
later
because
i
want
to
read
encompass
in
my
argument
the
exact
statement
which
was
warning
which
was
given.
they
were
indicted
on
a
charge
of
conspiracy
to
obstruct
the
due
administration
of
the
motor
vehicle
traffic
laws
of
new
jersey.
there
was
a
trial
at
the
trial
after
the
introduction
of
evidence
by
the
prosecutor.
the
introduction
of
these
statements
became
an
issue.
in
the
trial
court
for
the
extensive
argument
from
the
prosecutor,
from
defense
counsel
and
participated
in
the
argument
and
discussion
himself
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
statute
and
the
warning
given
was
compulsory
and
whether
or
not
the
statements
were
voluntary.
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
the
statements
were
voluntary
admitted
them
into
evidence.
they
were
read
to
the
jury.
defendants
were
convicted
and
they
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
the
motion
for
the
new
trial
and
at
this
juncture
the
garrity
case
was
tried
first,
the
holroyd
case
was
tried
second,
when
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
made
they
were
consolidated
and
stipulations
were
entered
by
trial
counsel
in
both
cases
at
the
issues
were
the
same.
so
the
trial
judge
in
considering
the
motion
for
new
trial
considered
both
cases
together.
he
rendered
--
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
denied.
but
he
rendered
an
opinion
quite
to
link
the
opinion
which
appears
at
page
545
of
the
record
and
he
touched
specifically
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
as
it
related
to
the
warning
and
to
the
admissibility
of
the
statements
of
voluntariness
of
the
statements.
he
goes
on
at
length
in
reviewing
the
twining
case.
he
reviews
the
adamson
case
and
he
quotes
at
lengths
from
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
therein
and
in
my
opinion
the
frustration
of
the
trial
judge
in
not
being
able
to
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional.
it
displayed
in
one
paragraph
of
its
opinion
and
i
would
like
to
read
it
to
the
court.
this
in
on
page
547
of
the
record,
“this
court
is
--
and
this
is
a
trial
judge
speaking,
“this
court
is
also
aware
that
the
adamson
case
was
at
five
to
four
decision
and
that
since
1947
notable
expansion
of
the
due
process
clause
has
taken
place.
then
he
goes
on
in
spite
of
the
above
dissent
referring
to
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
and
the
continual
broadening
trend
of
the
due
process
clause
a
trial
court
must
take
the
laws
that
finds
it
and
cannot
create
new
law
at
this
level.
it
follows
therefore
that
the
statute
does
not
violate
the
federal
constitution.
i
say
and
i
think
in
all
sincerity
that
the
trial
judge
encountered
a
frustration
there
because
it
was
his
desire
and
his
wish
to
declare
it
unconstitutional
but
because
of
the
laws
that
stood
at
that
time
he
was
unable
to.
from
the
trial
court,
an
appeal
was
taken
and
in
the
appellate
division
which
is
an
intermediate
appellate
step
in
the
new
jersey
jurisdiction.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
reached
down
and
certified
the
case
to
itself,
it
heard
argument
from
counsel,
it
considered
the
briefs
and
i
must
say
the
argument
of
counsel,
the
briefs
of
both
parties,
all
touched
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
they
made
two
findings
which
are
extremely
pertinent
to
us
to
here
today.
one
was
that
this
statute
created
a
type
ought
to
be
warning
given
by
the
attorney
general
was
a
type
of
compulsion
which
could
be
legitimately
used
and
then
it
went
on
and
considered
the
constitutionality
of
the
question
and
avoided
that
issue
by
finding
that
the
defendants
had
no
standing
to
question
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
consider
this
matter.
the
appeal
was
taken
under
section
1257
subparagraph
2,
title
28
and
in
order
for
jurisdiction
to
attach
to
this
case.
there
are
two
factors
which
must
be
met.
one
is,
was
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
the
issue
in
the
courts
below
and
secondly,
did
the
state
court
render
an
adverse
finding?
it's
our
contention
that
both
factors
are
present
at
this
trial.
the
trial
judge
made
an
expressed
finding
which
i
have
read
to
the
court.
the
supreme
court
even
though
it
was
raised
on
appeal
and
argued
both
in
oral
argument
and
brief.
the
supreme
court
avoided
the
issue
by
saying
that
the
appellants
did
not,
were
not
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
statute.
and
i'd
like
to
read
from
page
327
of
the
record,
the
exact
language
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
that
connection.
it's
very
short.
the
defendants
further
contend
that
new
jersey
statute
2
(a)
8117.1
is
unconstitutional.
as
we
have
mentioned
earlier
in
this
opinion
mr.
reg,
that's
the
attorney
general
that
took
that
statement
and
did
not
expressly
threaten
to
invoke
the
sanction
of
the
statute
against
the
defendants
garrity
in
virtue.
the
warning
he
gave
them
was
to
the
effect
that
if
they
did
not
cooperate
in
the
investigation
they
might
be
subject
to
dismissal
as
a
result
of
a
subsequent
proceeding.
we
determined
that
such
a
dismissal
would
be
proper
even
in
the
absence
of
the
statute.
therefore,
we
conclude
that
the
defendants
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
are
not
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
what
the
supreme
court
did,
it
avoided
meeting
the
constitutional
issue
and
set
itself
up
as
the
final
arbiter
as
to
who
can
raise
a
constitutional
question.
that
is
a
prerogative
of
this
court
as
to
what
citizens
of
the
states
can
raise
the
constitutional
question.
the
supreme
court
cannot
avoid
it
and
this
court
must
accept
that.
in
other
words,
it
has
done
indirectly
what
it
did
not
want
to
do
directly.
now,
on
this
appeal,
there
are
three
principle
questions
raised.
one
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
second
is
the
admissibility
of
the
statement
in
evidence
during
the
trial
and
the
third
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
could
properly
review
as
non-judicial
act
in
which
it
participated.
the
first
question
is
squarely
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
it
meet
all
--
meet
both
factors
as
required
by
title
28.
the
second
question
is
so
intertwined
with
the
first
that
it
cannot
be
separated
because
if
the
first
question,
if
an
answer
to
the
first
question
the
court
finds
that
the
statements
were
involuntary
then
it
naturally
follows
that
the
admissibility
of
those
statement
in
evidence
was
depravation
of
due
process.
the
court
--
third
question
we
concede
is
not
within
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
but
it
is
of
such
significance
that
it
could
be
considered.
the
second
and
third
questions
can
be
considered
because
they
deny
of
federal
right
and
if
the
first
question
is
a
properly
--
with
it
properly
within
the
appeal
jurisdiction
of
the
court
then
because
the
other
two
questions
are
of
real
substance
and
have
denied
a
federal
right
then
they
can
be
considered
by
this
court.
lastly,
as
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned
in
the
even
this
court
should
decide
that
the
first
question
is
not
within
the
appeal
jurisdiction
then
the
appellants
rely
on
section
2103
of
the
code
which
provides
for
certiorari
in
matters
where
the
--
in
themselves
would
be
subject
to
certiorari.
i
now
leave
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
i
turn
to
the
principle
question
of
argument
today
and
that
is
the
constitutionality
of
new
jersey's
statute
2
(a)
8117.1.
this
case
challenges
the
use
of
the
statute
to
extort
or
extract
so-called
voluntary
statements
from
defendants
and
at
this
time
i
want
to
read
to
the
court
the
warning
which
was
given
to
the
defendant
holroyd.
the
deputy
attorney
general
prefaces
remarks
as
follows
and
i'm
reading
from
page
10
of
the
brief.
question,
all
right,
under
a
supreme
court
order
dated
the
20th
of
june
1961,
i
have
been
directed
to
investigate
irregularities
in
the
handling
of
municipal
court
vehicle
matters
in
the
borough
barrington
and
how
they
have
been
handled
by
the
court
and
local
police
departments.
as
a
result,
i
have
asked
you
to
come
here
today
so
i
may
put
questions
to
you.
answer,
yes.
question,
i
want
you
to
fully
--
to
realize
fully
however,
any
answers
you
give
must
be
voluntary
without
any
coercion,
threat,
or
promise
of
reward
and
those
answers
may
be
used
against
you
or
any
other
person.
you
have
a
privilege
to
refuse
to
disclose
any
matters
which
might
tend
to
incriminate
you.
however,
if
you
make
such
a
disclosure,
you
thereby
waive
your
right
or
privilege
in
relation
to
any
face
of
this
investigation
in
the
future.
now,
we
get
to
the
pertinent
part.
under
our
laws,
as
a
police
officer,
you
are
subject
to
a
statute
which
provides
however
if
you
exercise
this
right
or
privilege
a
proceeding
may
be
instituted
against
you
to
have
you
remove
from
office.
knowing
all
of
these,
you're
willing
to
proceed.
i
think
the
courts
of
this
case
rest
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey's
finding
that
this
was
a
type
of
compulsion
which
could
be
legitimately
used.
and
here
the
court
is
admitting
that
compulsion
was
used
and
question
that
to
be
answered
is,
has
this
court
or
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
of
due
process
ever
acknowledge
any
degree
of
compulsion.
in
other
words,
can
the
privilege
at
the
whim
of
the
court
by
declaring
degrees
of
compulsion
nullify
this
privilege?
i
don't
believe
that
the
compulsion
of
any
type
can
be
tolerated
by
the
fifth
amendment
nor
do
i
believe
and
is
recognized
just
like
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
distinguished
between
race,
creed,
or
color,
social
standing
or
otherwise.
i
know
that
the
attorney
general,
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
giving
the
statement
probably
felt
that
he
was
giving
to
those
defendants
information
concerning
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
but
one
thing
that
he
did
was
mislead
them
to
the
extent
of
saying
you
may
be
subject
to
a
proceedings
to
have
you
removed.
there
is
no
room
in
the
statute
for
a
may
or
maybe.
the
statute
is
not
permissive,
it
is
mandatory.
it
says
shall
be
removed
and
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
two
of
its
own
--,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
two
of
its
own
cases,
lava
versus
north
board
of
education
and
lowenstein
versus
north
board
of
education
has
interpreted
this
statute
to
be
mandatory.
both
of
the
cases
are
cited
in
the
briefs
so
i
won't
give
the
citation
but
i'd
like
to
read
from
the
lava
case.
and
this
involved
a
fitness
hearing
on
a
school
teacher
by
the
north
board
of
education
and
the
supreme
court
in
reviewing
the
applicability
of
this
particular
statute
to
that
proceedings
it
says,
it
does
not
of
course
restrict
the
preexisting
power
of
a
supervisory
school
authority
to
conduct
an
inquiry
in
to
the
continued
fitness
of
a
teacher
but
seemingly
has
the
additional
effect
that
if
during
the
course
of
such
an
inquiry
there's
a
refusal
to
answer
which
falls
within
all
the
pertinent
terms
of
the
statute.
then,
dismissal
is
mandatory
and
in
the
law
in
lowenstein
case
which
was
decided
some
four
years
later
in
1961
and
which
likewise
had
the
question
of
a
teacher's
dismissal
of
conduct
unbecoming
a
teacher
the
court
commented
and
interpreted
its
own
decision
in
the
lava
case
and
in
comment
on
the
lava
case
the
court
held
the
inquiry
approach
was
premised
on
the
obligation
of
a
teacher
to
respond
fully
without
any
right
to
rely
on
a
constitutional
privilege.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
the
threat
--
the
warning
referred
to
the
statute.
the
warning
said,
as
police
officers
you
may
be
removed
or
as
the
supreme
court
says,
it
is
mandatory
--
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
says,
it's
mandatory.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
i'm
saying
that
the
investigating
officer
attempted
to
mislead.
he
gave
the
warning
and
then
instead
of
saying,
you
will
be
out
of
your
job
if
you
refuse
to
testify.
he
said,
you
may
or
may
be
subject
to
this
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
there's
no
question
about
the
intimidation.
the
defendants
were
well
aware
of
the
statute.
they
were
well
aware
that
it
was
mandatory.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
mislead?
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
no,
no
i
just
called
that
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
because
of
the
threat.
the
threat
which
was
given
under
the
statute
they
would
be
out
of
a
job.
in
other
words,
anything
that
proceeded
in
this
inquiry
was
under
the
rest
and
coercion
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
defendants
had
no
choice.
they
either
talk
or
they
were
out
of
their
jobs.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
think
that
it
just
embellishes
the
threat.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
it's
coercive,
it's
compulsive.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
the
mere
fact
that
it's
on
book
of
every
public
employee
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
under
this
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
they
did
testify.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
they
were
not
fired.
they
were
fired
after
conviction.
they
lost
their
jobs
after
conviction.
but
this
is
a
settled
use
of
the
statute
to
obtain
confessions
and
then
use
those
confessions
in
the
conviction
of
the
individuals.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
the
defendants
had
no
choice
your
honor.
the
investigating
officer
put
it
to
them.
what
he
did,
he
said,
look,
you
have
the
right
not
to
testify
but
if
you
exercise
that
right
then
the
effect
of
the
statute
comes
to
bear
and
you're
out
of
your
job.
so
they
had
no
choice.
they
didn't
have
the
freedom
of
choice
at
the
very
threshold
that's
said
in
malloy
versus
hogan
of
the
unfettered
exercise
of
their
own
free
will.
they
had
to
choose
a
lesser
of
two
evils.
there
was
no
freedom
of
choice.
this
statute
is
compulsory
in
its
inception
and
its
objective
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
the
legislative
history
in
connection
with
this.
this
statute
had
its
inception
with
the
chicago
crime
commission
and
the
counsel
of
state
governments
back
in
1953
after
the
spectacle
before
the
keith
law
firm
and
mccarthy
committees
of
public
officials,
hoodlums
and
racketeers
appearing
before
them
and
taking
the
fifth
amendment
and
this
--
the
legislative
history,
this
is
the
report
of
the
state
legislature
at
the
time
the
bill
was
enacted.
and
i'm
reading
from
appendix
1
(a)
of
the
brief.
it
is
proposed
by
this
bill
to
remove
the
impediment
to
investigation
which
is
contained
in
constitutional
provisions
protecting
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it
would
penalize
any
person
who
refuses
to
testify
on
matters
relating
to
his
office
on
the
ground
that
his
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
or
by
requiring
that
he
forfeit
his
office
and
be
prohibited
from
whole
and
further
office
referred
to
five
years.
it
is
been
argued
that
the
bill
and
effect
now
applies
the
constitutional
protection
against
self-incrimination
for
the
public
official
involved.
they
may
exercise
their
privilege
but
to
do
so
involves
the
loss
of
their
primary
livelihood.
so,
any
public
official
with
the
statute
such
as
this
on
the
record
books
when
he
is
involved
in
an
official
inquiry
he
has
no
freedom
of
choice
whatsoever
and
this
is
a
criminal
proceedings.
this
is
not
a
similar
proceeding,
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
i
think
the
statute
is
very
much
involved.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
i
think
so,
yes.
if
the
statute
were
not
involved
why
there
wouldn't
be
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
no,
i
think
this
court
--
if
this
court
has
treated
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
but
it's
the
use
of
the
statute,
it's
the
use
of
the
statute
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
then
you
say
and
go
to
the
voluntariness
of
state?
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
in
essence,
it
is
but
the
removal
of
the
statute
--
i
mean,
this
statute
has
been
before
the
court
in
enormous
occasions
and
this
to
our
knowledge
is
a
first
time
it's
been
used
to
extract
statement
and
statements
were
given.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
that
the
investigating
officer
wouldn't
have
the
statute
to
rely
on
to
compel
him
to
testify.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
he
didn't
call
it
by
name
but
he
referred
to
it
specifically.
we
have
a
statute
which
requires
you
to
testify.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
that's
what
i
say
to
new
jersey
supreme
court
avoided.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
went
off
on
tenure
of
some
high
duty
that
the
police
officers
suppose
to
have
to
testify
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
but
this
high
duty
doesn't
--
we
don't
reach
that
here.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
think
it
can
be
argued
that
way
but
i
do
think
that
statute
is
very
much
involved.
and
i
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
if
you
don't
think
the
statute
is
involved
should
affirm,
no.
i
wouldn't
make
that
confession.
no,
i
think
the
statute
is
involved
100%.
i
think
that's
the
crux
of
the
case
because
if
it
were
not
for
this
--
if
it
were
not
for
the
statute,
these
statements
would
not
have
been
obtained.
there
possibly
would
never
been
a
trial
in
the
courts
below.
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
it's
a
mere
presence
to
the
statute
on
the
books
--
on
the
statute
books
of
new
jersey
that
has
brought
us
here.
no,
i
don't
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
this
--
mr.
chief
justice,
this
goes
to
the
long
line
of
cases
involving
police
officers
and
removal
of
office
by
reason
of
unfitness
for
duty
or
disobedience
and
subordination
or
something.
and
the
supreme
court
touched
on
all
those
cases.
it
didn't
meet
the
real
issue.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
and
that's
why
i
say
that
the
statute
can't
be
isolated
from
the
warning
because
of
mere
presence
of
the
statute
on
the
statute
but
was
a
coercion
and
compulsion
which
these
police
officers
were
subjected
to
if
the
statute
wasn't
there,
sure,
they
take
it
to
their
chance
before
a
trial
board
maybe.
but
this
statute
and
these
are
men
that
had
15,
16
years
to
service
and
they
had
real
pension
rights.
so,
no,
i
think
the
statute
is
very
much
involved
and
in
any
warning
without
the
statute,
the
fact
that
--
see,
they
knew
it's
mandatory
that
they
be
removed
from
their
jobs.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
this
was
the
point
where
they
could
take
their
chances
for
a
trial
board
or
something
like
that.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
can
only
speculate
as
to
what
would've
happen
at
the
time
and
my
speculation
would
be
that
they
wouldn't
have
given
the
statements.
see,
that's
the
only
thing.
in
other
words,
this
is
an
accomplished
fact
now.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
and
if
that
statute
was
not
on
the
books
and
this
threat
of
the
loss
of
the
livelihood
hanging
over
their
heads
and
this
attorney
general
or
asking
them
questions
and
he
gives
them
their
warning
and
he
says,
you
maybe
subject
to
a
trial
board
proceedings.
i
would
weigh
that
they
would
not
testify.
they
take
their
chances
for
the
trial
board
but
by
the
mere
presence
of
the
statute,
then
they
gave
their
statement.
so,
that's
why
i
say
that
the
statute
cannot
be
removed
from
consideration
of
this
case.
i
see
my
five-minute
warning
and
i
see
and
i
have
one
last
point
that
i
want
to
touch
upon
and
that's
the
non-judicial
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
state
new
jersey.
this
point
is
raised
for
the
first
time
here.
i'm
well
aware
of
the
precedents
of
the
requirement
that
this
court
does
not
consider
matters
that
have
not
been
considered
in
the
courts
below.
but
it
seems
to
me
so
contrary
to
our
concepts,
democracy
and
justice
under
our
constitutional
government
that
any
time
a
state
supreme
court
initiates
an
investigation,
conducts
the
investigation,
reviews
the
results
of
those
investigations
and
undoubtedly
pre
--
had
a
preconception
of
guilt
refers
those
investigations
to
a
prosecutor
for
grand
jury
action
and
after
trial
and
conviction
takes
the
case
into
itself
and
sits
in
judgment
on
its
own
preconceived
ideas
is
a
matter
which
presents
the
serious
challenge
to
this
court.
i
don't
think
any
court
in
any
state
of
the
union
should
act
as
investig
–
complainant,
investigator,
prosecutor,
and
a
court
of
last
resort.
it's
so
foreign
our
concept
of
justice
that
i
was
shocked
when
i
was
brought
into
this
case
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
understand
that
and
i've
read
the
brief
of
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
mr.
justice
brennan,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
system
that
exist
in
new
jersey
and
i'm
certain
that
the
system
exist
in
others
of
the
50
states
similar
to
that
that
this
act
there
has
to
be
found
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
this
act
--
no,
this
act
of
the
supreme
court
should
be
reviewed
and
this
court
should
consider.
it's
a
real
challenge.
frankly,
i
don't
know
how
to
go
about
it,
what
solution
to
recommend.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
in
matters
of
involving
potential
criminal
violations,
it
should
be
referred
to
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
to
the
executive
for
investigation,
yes.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
remain
a
loop.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
that's
one
solution
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
whole
solution
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
yes.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
if
you
want
to
give
me
that
(voice
overlap).
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
that
certainly
it
is.
it
certainly
is.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
which
we
are
considering
now
is
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
there
are
two
cases
which
have
been
consolidated
on
this
appeal
both
of
which
involved
practically
the
same
set
of
facts
and
the
issues
are
identical.
the
cases
below
involved
police
officers
who
were
serving
the
boroughs
of
bellmawr
and
barrington
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
in
the
first
case
below,
the
appellants
garrity
in
virtue
were
indicted,
tried
and
convicted.
there
was
a
third
defendant
in
that
case
a
mrs.
naglee
who
is
not
a
party
to
this
appeal
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
she
was
deceased.
the
second
case
involved
three
police
officers
of
the
borough
of
barrington,
mrs.
holroyd,
elwell,
and
murray.
as
i've
stated
there's
no
basic
dispute
as
to
the
facts
in
the
case
but
because
this
case
was
allowed
by
this
court
and
jurisdiction
--
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
deferred
pending
oral
argument,
i
feel
it
necessary
to
go
into
the
background
before
i
reach
the
argument
on
jurisdiction.
this
case
had
its
inception
in
an
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
dated
june
30,
1961
or
in
it
directed
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
the
practice
of
downgrading
traffic
ticket
violations
in
these
two
boroughs
namely
bellmawr
and
barrington.
both
order
--
the
order
to
investigate
both
boroughs
was
signed
on
the
same
date
and
the
attorney
general
designated
one
of
his
deputies
to
conduct
the
investigation.
during
the
course
of
the
investigation,
it
became
necessary
to
take
oral
testimony
of
the
defendants.
the
new
jersey
in
1953
enacted
a
state
statute
which
became
very
pertinent
in
the
taking
of
the
statements
in
which
is
the
reason
why
we're
here
today.
briefly,
that
statute
provided
it's
denominated
the
generally
is
the
official
conduct
statute
and
statutes
of
this
type
are
not
strangers
to
this
court.
it
provides
briefly,
that
any
person
holding
public
office
who
haven't
been
sworn,
refuses
to
testify
or
to
answer
any
material
question
upon
the
ground
that
his
answer
may
tend
to
incriminate
him
or
compel
him
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
shall
if
holding
public
office
be
removed
that
forfeit
his
office,
position
or
employment
and
any
vested
or
future
right
or
tenure,
and
pensions
granted
to
him.
that
then
goes
on
provide
that
he
shall
not
be
eligible
to
hold
public
office
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
for
ever
after.
now,
prior
to
taking
the
statements
and
after
swearing
the
defendants,
the
investigating
deputy
attorney
general
gave
a
warning
in
which
he
advised
each
defendant
of
his
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
but
explain
to
them
that
if
he
--
if
they
made
a
disclosure
then
they
would
have
to
answer
questions
on
all
other
--
answer
all
other
questions
which
were
asked.
and
then
after
advising
them
of
their
right
not
to
testify,
he
went
on
to
nullify
that
right
by
saying,
“but
because
you
are
police
officers
and
there
is
a
statute
in
this
state
which
requires
you
to
testify
and
if
you
don't
then
you
will
lose
your
jobs.”
now,
that
warning
all
defendants
testified.
they
incriminated
themselves
by
explaining
the
method
of
how
tickets
were
downgraded
and
subsequently
the
state
--
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
attorney
general's
office
referred
the
results
of
the
investigation
to
the
camden
county
prosecutor
for
presentation
of
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
indicted
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
it
was
an
accurate
statement
of
the
law
insofar
as
it
went
and
as
far
as
the
statute
was
concerned,
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that.
in
other
words,
what
he
and
thinks
and
said
what
exactly
what
the
statements
says.
in
other
words,
the
statute
says
that
if
you
refuse
to
testify
and
you
are
holding
public
office
then
you
shall
be
removed
from
office.
the
wording
of
the
--
i'll
read
that
just
a
little
bit
later
because
i
want
to
read
encompass
in
my
argument
the
exact
statement
which
was
warning
which
was
given.
they
were
indicted
on
a
charge
of
conspiracy
to
obstruct
the
due
administration
of
the
motor
vehicle
traffic
laws
of
new
jersey.
there
was
a
trial
at
the
trial
after
the
introduction
of
evidence
by
the
prosecutor.
the
introduction
of
these
statements
became
an
issue.
in
the
trial
court
for
the
extensive
argument
from
the
prosecutor,
from
defense
counsel
and
participated
in
the
argument
and
discussion
himself
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
statute
and
the
warning
given
was
compulsory
and
whether
or
not
the
statements
were
voluntary.
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
the
statements
were
voluntary
admitted
them
into
evidence.
they
were
read
to
the
jury.
defendants
were
convicted
and
they
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
the
motion
for
the
new
trial
and
at
this
juncture
the
garrity
case
was
tried
first,
the
holroyd
case
was
tried
second,
when
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
made
they
were
consolidated
and
stipulations
were
entered
by
trial
counsel
in
both
cases
at
the
issues
were
the
same.
so
the
trial
judge
in
considering
the
motion
for
new
trial
considered
both
cases
together.
he
rendered
--
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
denied.
but
he
rendered
an
opinion
quite
to
link
the
opinion
which
appears
at
page
545
of
the
record
and
he
touched
specifically
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
as
it
related
to
the
warning
and
to
the
admissibility
of
the
statements
of
voluntariness
of
the
statements.
he
goes
on
at
length
in
reviewing
the
twining
case.
he
reviews
the
adamson
case
and
he
quotes
at
lengths
from
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
therein
and
in
my
opinion
the
frustration
of
the
trial
judge
in
not
being
able
to
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional.
it
displayed
in
one
paragraph
of
its
opinion
and
i
would
like
to
read
it
to
the
court.
this
in
on
page
547
of
the
record,
“this
court
is
--
and
this
is
a
trial
judge
speaking,
“this
court
is
also
aware
that
the
adamson
case
was
at
five
to
four
decision
and
that
since
1947
notable
expansion
of
the
due
process
clause
has
taken
place.
then
he
goes
on
in
spite
of
the
above
dissent
referring
to
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
and
the
continual
broadening
trend
of
the
due
process
clause
a
trial
court
must
take
the
laws
that
finds
it
and
cannot
create
new
law
at
this
level.
it
follows
therefore
that
the
statute
does
not
violate
the
federal
constitution.
i
say
and
i
think
in
all
sincerity
that
the
trial
judge
encountered
a
frustration
there
because
it
was
his
desire
and
his
wish
to
declare
it
unconstitutional
but
because
of
the
laws
that
stood
at
that
time
he
was
unable
to.
from
the
trial
court,
an
appeal
was
taken
and
in
the
appellate
division
which
is
an
intermediate
appellate
step
in
the
new
jersey
jurisdiction.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
reached
down
and
certified
the
case
to
itself,
it
heard
argument
from
counsel,
it
considered
the
briefs
and
i
must
say
the
argument
of
counsel,
the
briefs
of
both
parties,
all
touched
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
they
made
two
findings
which
are
extremely
pertinent
to
us
to
here
today.
one
was
that
this
statute
created
a
type
ought
to
be
warning
given
by
the
attorney
general
was
a
type
of
compulsion
which
could
be
legitimately
used
and
then
it
went
on
and
considered
the
constitutionality
of
the
question
and
avoided
that
issue
by
finding
that
the
defendants
had
no
standing
to
question
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
consider
this
matter.
the
appeal
was
taken
under
section
1257
subparagraph
2,
title
28
and
in
order
for
jurisdiction
to
attach
to
this
case.
there
are
two
factors
which
must
be
met.
one
is,
was
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
the
issue
in
the
courts
below
and
secondly,
did
the
state
court
render
an
adverse
finding?
it's
our
contention
that
both
factors
are
present
at
this
trial.
the
trial
judge
made
an
expressed
finding
which
i
have
read
to
the
court.
the
supreme
court
even
though
it
was
raised
on
appeal
and
argued
both
in
oral
argument
and
brief.
the
supreme
court
avoided
the
issue
by
saying
that
the
appellants
did
not,
were
not
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
statute.
and
i'd
like
to
read
from
page
327
of
the
record,
the
exact
language
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
that
connection.
it's
very
short.
the
defendants
further
contend
that
new
jersey
statute
2
(a)
8117.1
is
unconstitutional.
as
we
have
mentioned
earlier
in
this
opinion
mr.
reg,
that's
the
attorney
general
that
took
that
statement
and
did
not
expressly
threaten
to
invoke
the
sanction
of
the
statute
against
the
defendants
garrity
in
virtue.
the
warning
he
gave
them
was
to
the
effect
that
if
they
did
not
cooperate
in
the
investigation
they
might
be
subject
to
dismissal
as
a
result
of
a
subsequent
proceeding.
we
determined
that
such
a
dismissal
would
be
proper
even
in
the
absence
of
the
statute.
therefore,
we
conclude
that
the
defendants
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
are
not
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
what
the
supreme
court
did,
it
avoided
meeting
the
constitutional
issue
and
set
itself
up
as
the
final
arbiter
as
to
who
can
raise
a
constitutional
question.
that
is
a
prerogative
of
this
court
as
to
what
citizens
of
the
states
can
raise
the
constitutional
question.
the
supreme
court
cannot
avoid
it
and
this
court
must
accept
that.
in
other
words,
it
has
done
indirectly
what
it
did
not
want
to
do
directly.
now,
on
this
appeal,
there
are
three
principle
questions
raised.
one
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
second
is
the
admissibility
of
the
statement
in
evidence
during
the
trial
and
the
third
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
could
properly
review
as
non-judicial
act
in
which
it
participated.
the
first
question
is
squarely
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
it
meet
all
--
meet
both
factors
as
required
by
title
28.
the
second
question
is
so
intertwined
with
the
first
that
it
cannot
be
separated
because
if
the
first
question,
if
an
answer
to
the
first
question
the
court
finds
that
the
statements
were
involuntary
then
it
naturally
follows
that
the
admissibility
of
those
statement
in
evidence
was
depravation
of
due
process.
the
court
--
third
question
we
concede
is
not
within
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
but
it
is
of
such
significance
that
it
could
be
considered.
the
second
and
third
questions
can
be
considered
because
they
deny
of
federal
right
and
if
the
first
question
is
a
properly
--
with
it
properly
within
the
appeal
jurisdiction
of
the
court
then
because
the
other
two
questions
are
of
real
substance
and
have
denied
a
federal
right
then
they
can
be
considered
by
this
court.
lastly,
as
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned
in
the
even
this
court
should
decide
that
the
first
question
is
not
within
the
appeal
jurisdiction
then
the
appellants
rely
on
section
2103
of
the
code
which
provides
for
certiorari
in
matters
where
the
--
in
themselves
would
be
subject
to
certiorari.
i
now
leave
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
i
turn
to
the
principle
question
of
argument
today
and
that
is
the
constitutionality
of
new
jersey's
statute
2
(a)
8117.1.
this
case
challenges
the
use
of
the
statute
to
extort
or
extract
so-called
voluntary
statements
from
defendants
and
at
this
time
i
want
to
read
to
the
court
the
warning
which
was
given
to
the
defendant
holroyd.
the
deputy
attorney
general
prefaces
remarks
as
follows
and
i'm
reading
from
page
10
of
the
brief.
question,
all
right,
under
a
supreme
court
order
dated
the
20th
of
june
1961,
i
have
been
directed
to
investigate
irregularities
in
the
handling
of
municipal
court
vehicle
matters
in
the
borough
barrington
and
how
they
have
been
handled
by
the
court
and
local
police
departments.
as
a
result,
i
have
asked
you
to
come
here
today
so
i
may
put
questions
to
you.
answer,
yes.
question,
i
want
you
to
fully
--
to
realize
fully
however,
any
answers
you
give
must
be
voluntary
without
any
coercion,
threat,
or
promise
of
reward
and
those
answers
may
be
used
against
you
or
any
other
person.
you
have
a
privilege
to
refuse
to
disclose
any
matters
which
might
tend
to
incriminate
you.
however,
if
you
make
such
a
disclosure,
you
thereby
waive
your
right
or
privilege
in
relation
to
any
face
of
this
investigation
in
the
future.
now,
we
get
to
the
pertinent
part.
under
our
laws,
as
a
police
officer,
you
are
subject
to
a
statute
which
provides
however
if
you
exercise
this
right
or
privilege
a
proceeding
may
be
instituted
against
you
to
have
you
remove
from
office.
knowing
all
of
these,
you're
willing
to
proceed.
i
think
the
courts
of
this
case
rest
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey's
finding
that
this
was
a
type
of
compulsion
which
could
be
legitimately
used.
and
here
the
court
is
admitting
that
compulsion
was
used
and
question
that
to
be
answered
is,
has
this
court
or
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
of
due
process
ever
acknowledge
any
degree
of
compulsion.
in
other
words,
can
the
privilege
at
the
whim
of
the
court
by
declaring
degrees
of
compulsion
nullify
this
privilege?
i
don't
believe
that
the
compulsion
of
any
type
can
be
tolerated
by
the
fifth
amendment
nor
do
i
believe
and
is
recognized
just
like
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
distinguished
between
race,
creed,
or
color,
social
standing
or
otherwise.
i
know
that
the
attorney
general,
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
giving
the
statement
probably
felt
that
he
was
giving
to
those
defendants
information
concerning
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
but
one
thing
that
he
did
was
mislead
them
to
the
extent
of
saying
you
may
be
subject
to
a
proceedings
to
have
you
removed.
there
is
no
room
in
the
statute
for
a
may
or
maybe.
the
statute
is
not
permissive,
it
is
mandatory.
it
says
shall
be
removed
and
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
two
of
its
own
--,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
two
of
its
own
cases,
lava
versus
north
board
of
education
and
lowenstein
versus
north
board
of
education
has
interpreted
this
statute
to
be
mandatory.
both
of
the
cases
are
cited
in
the
briefs
so
i
won't
give
the
citation
but
i'd
like
to
read
from
the
lava
case.
and
this
involved
a
fitness
hearing
on
a
school
teacher
by
the
north
board
of
education
and
the
supreme
court
in
reviewing
the
applicability
of
this
particular
statute
to
that
proceedings
it
says,
it
does
not
of
course
restrict
the
preexisting
power
of
a
supervisory
school
authority
to
conduct
an
inquiry
in
to
the
continued
fitness
of
a
teacher
but
seemingly
has
the
additional
effect
that
if
during
the
course
of
such
an
inquiry
there's
a
refusal
to
answer
which
falls
within
all
the
pertinent
terms
of
the
statute.
then,
dismissal
is
mandatory
and
in
the
law
in
lowenstein
case
which
was
decided
some
four
years
later
in
1961
and
which
likewise
had
the
question
of
a
teacher's
dismissal
of
conduct
unbecoming
a
teacher
the
court
commented
and
interpreted
its
own
decision
in
the
lava
case
and
in
comment
on
the
lava
case
the
court
held
the
inquiry
approach
was
premised
on
the
obligation
of
a
teacher
to
respond
fully
without
any
right
to
rely
on
a
constitutional
privilege.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
the
threat
--
the
warning
referred
to
the
statute.
the
warning
said,
as
police
officers
you
may
be
removed
or
as
the
supreme
court
says,
it
is
mandatory
--
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
says,
it's
mandatory.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
i'm
saying
that
the
investigating
officer
attempted
to
mislead.
he
gave
the
warning
and
then
instead
of
saying,
you
will
be
out
of
your
job
if
you
refuse
to
testify.
he
said,
you
may
or
may
be
subject
to
this
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
there's
no
question
about
the
intimidation.
the
defendants
were
well
aware
of
the
statute.
they
were
well
aware
that
it
was
mandatory.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
mislead?
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
no,
no
i
just
called
that
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
because
of
the
threat.
the
threat
which
was
given
under
the
statute
they
would
be
out
of
a
job.
in
other
words,
anything
that
proceeded
in
this
inquiry
was
under
the
rest
and
coercion
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
defendants
had
no
choice.
they
either
talk
or
they
were
out
of
their
jobs.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
think
that
it
just
embellishes
the
threat.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
it's
coercive,
it's
compulsive.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
the
mere
fact
that
it's
on
book
of
every
public
employee
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
under
this
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
they
did
testify.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
they
were
not
fired.
they
were
fired
after
conviction.
they
lost
their
jobs
after
conviction.
but
this
is
a
settled
use
of
the
statute
to
obtain
confessions
and
then
use
those
confessions
in
the
conviction
of
the
individuals.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
the
defendants
had
no
choice
your
honor.
the
investigating
officer
put
it
to
them.
what
he
did,
he
said,
look,
you
have
the
right
not
to
testify
but
if
you
exercise
that
right
then
the
effect
of
the
statute
comes
to
bear
and
you're
out
of
your
job.
so
they
had
no
choice.
they
didn't
have
the
freedom
of
choice
at
the
very
threshold
that's
said
in
malloy
versus
hogan
of
the
unfettered
exercise
of
their
own
free
will.
they
had
to
choose
a
lesser
of
two
evils.
there
was
no
freedom
of
choice.
this
statute
is
compulsory
in
its
inception
and
its
objective
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
the
legislative
history
in
connection
with
this.
this
statute
had
its
inception
with
the
chicago
crime
commission
and
the
counsel
of
state
governments
back
in
1953
after
the
spectacle
before
the
keith
law
firm
and
mccarthy
committees
of
public
officials,
hoodlums
and
racketeers
appearing
before
them
and
taking
the
fifth
amendment
and
this
--
the
legislative
history,
this
is
the
report
of
the
state
legislature
at
the
time
the
bill
was
enacted.
and
i'm
reading
from
appendix
1
(a)
of
the
brief.
it
is
proposed
by
this
bill
to
remove
the
impediment
to
investigation
which
is
contained
in
constitutional
provisions
protecting
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it
would
penalize
any
person
who
refuses
to
testify
on
matters
relating
to
his
office
on
the
ground
that
his
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
or
by
requiring
that
he
forfeit
his
office
and
be
prohibited
from
whole
and
further
office
referred
to
five
years.
it
is
been
argued
that
the
bill
and
effect
now
applies
the
constitutional
protection
against
self-incrimination
for
the
public
official
involved.
they
may
exercise
their
privilege
but
to
do
so
involves
the
loss
of
their
primary
livelihood.
so,
any
public
official
with
the
statute
such
as
this
on
the
record
books
when
he
is
involved
in
an
official
inquiry
he
has
no
freedom
of
choice
whatsoever
and
this
is
a
criminal
proceedings.
this
is
not
a
similar
proceeding,
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
i
think
the
statute
is
very
much
involved.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
i
think
so,
yes.
if
the
statute
were
not
involved
why
there
wouldn't
be
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
no,
i
think
this
court
--
if
this
court
has
treated
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
but
it's
the
use
of
the
statute,
it's
the
use
of
the
statute
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
then
you
say
and
go
to
the
voluntariness
of
state?
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
in
essence,
it
is
but
the
removal
of
the
statute
--
i
mean,
this
statute
has
been
before
the
court
in
enormous
occasions
and
this
to
our
knowledge
is
a
first
time
it's
been
used
to
extract
statement
and
statements
were
given.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
that
the
investigating
officer
wouldn't
have
the
statute
to
rely
on
to
compel
him
to
testify.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
he
didn't
call
it
by
name
but
he
referred
to
it
specifically.
we
have
a
statute
which
requires
you
to
testify.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
that's
what
i
say
to
new
jersey
supreme
court
avoided.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
went
off
on
tenure
of
some
high
duty
that
the
police
officers
suppose
to
have
to
testify
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
but
this
high
duty
doesn't
--
we
don't
reach
that
here.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
think
it
can
be
argued
that
way
but
i
do
think
that
statute
is
very
much
involved.
and
i
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
if
you
don't
think
the
statute
is
involved
should
affirm,
no.
i
wouldn't
make
that
confession.
no,
i
think
the
statute
is
involved
100%.
i
think
that's
the
crux
of
the
case
because
if
it
were
not
for
this
--
if
it
were
not
for
the
statute,
these
statements
would
not
have
been
obtained.
there
possibly
would
never
been
a
trial
in
the
courts
below.
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
it's
a
mere
presence
to
the
statute
on
the
books
--
on
the
statute
books
of
new
jersey
that
has
brought
us
here.
no,
i
don't
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
well,
this
--
mr.
chief
justice,
this
goes
to
the
long
line
of
cases
involving
police
officers
and
removal
of
office
by
reason
of
unfitness
for
duty
or
disobedience
and
subordination
or
something.
and
the
supreme
court
touched
on
all
those
cases.
it
didn't
meet
the
real
issue.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
and
that's
why
i
say
that
the
statute
can't
be
isolated
from
the
warning
because
of
mere
presence
of
the
statute
on
the
statute
but
was
a
coercion
and
compulsion
which
these
police
officers
were
subjected
to
if
the
statute
wasn't
there,
sure,
they
take
it
to
their
chance
before
a
trial
board
maybe.
but
this
statute
and
these
are
men
that
had
15,
16
years
to
service
and
they
had
real
pension
rights.
so,
no,
i
think
the
statute
is
very
much
involved
and
in
any
warning
without
the
statute,
the
fact
that
--
see,
they
knew
it's
mandatory
that
they
be
removed
from
their
jobs.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
this
was
the
point
where
they
could
take
their
chances
for
a
trial
board
or
something
like
that.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
can
only
speculate
as
to
what
would've
happen
at
the
time
and
my
speculation
would
be
that
they
wouldn't
have
given
the
statements.
see,
that's
the
only
thing.
in
other
words,
this
is
an
accomplished
fact
now.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
and
if
that
statute
was
not
on
the
books
and
this
threat
of
the
loss
of
the
livelihood
hanging
over
their
heads
and
this
attorney
general
or
asking
them
questions
and
he
gives
them
their
warning
and
he
says,
you
maybe
subject
to
a
trial
board
proceedings.
i
would
weigh
that
they
would
not
testify.
they
take
their
chances
for
the
trial
board
but
by
the
mere
presence
of
the
statute,
then
they
gave
their
statement.
so,
that's
why
i
say
that
the
statute
cannot
be
removed
from
consideration
of
this
case.
i
see
my
five-minute
warning
and
i
see
and
i
have
one
last
point
that
i
want
to
touch
upon
and
that's
the
non-judicial
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
state
new
jersey.
this
point
is
raised
for
the
first
time
here.
i'm
well
aware
of
the
precedents
of
the
requirement
that
this
court
does
not
consider
matters
that
have
not
been
considered
in
the
courts
below.
but
it
seems
to
me
so
contrary
to
our
concepts,
democracy
and
justice
under
our
constitutional
government
that
any
time
a
state
supreme
court
initiates
an
investigation,
conducts
the
investigation,
reviews
the
results
of
those
investigations
and
undoubtedly
pre
--
had
a
preconception
of
guilt
refers
those
investigations
to
a
prosecutor
for
grand
jury
action
and
after
trial
and
conviction
takes
the
case
into
itself
and
sits
in
judgment
on
its
own
preconceived
ideas
is
a
matter
which
presents
the
serious
challenge
to
this
court.
i
don't
think
any
court
in
any
state
of
the
union
should
act
as
investig
–
complainant,
investigator,
prosecutor,
and
a
court
of
last
resort.
it's
so
foreign
our
concept
of
justice
that
i
was
shocked
when
i
was
brought
into
this
case
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
i
understand
that
and
i've
read
the
brief
of
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
mr.
justice
brennan,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
system
that
exist
in
new
jersey
and
i'm
certain
that
the
system
exist
in
others
of
the
50
states
similar
to
that
that
this
act
there
has
to
be
found
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
this
act
--
no,
this
act
of
the
supreme
court
should
be
reviewed
and
this
court
should
consider.
it's
a
real
challenge.
frankly,
i
don't
know
how
to
go
about
it,
what
solution
to
recommend.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
in
matters
of
involving
potential
criminal
violations,
it
should
be
referred
to
--
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
to
the
executive
for
investigation,
yes.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
remain
a
loop.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
that's
one
solution
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
whole
solution
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
yes.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
if
you
want
to
give
me
that
(voice
overlap).
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
l.
o'connor
that
certainly
it
is.
it
certainly
is.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
