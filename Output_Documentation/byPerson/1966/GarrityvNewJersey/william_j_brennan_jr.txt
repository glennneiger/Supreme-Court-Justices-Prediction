justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wait
a
minute,
that's
all
pursuant
to
a
system
in
the
judgment
and
of
which
the
municipal
court
was
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
supreme
courts,
that
what
i
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
of
these
instances
of
difficulties
in
the
municipal
courts
where
the
500
of
them
indicate
this
is
just
a
system
by
this
that
are
investigated
to
administrative
directors
today.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
speaking
about
the
act.
i
thought
you
were
complaining
about
the
use
of
the
attorney
general
that
they
can
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
it
is
a
federal
constitution
infirmity
in
a
system
under
which
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
to
which
it
administers
director's
office,
supervises
the
fiscal
affairs
of
the
municipal
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
want
to
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
want
us
to
strike
down
the
statute
and
you
want
us
also
to
strike
down
the
whole
system
of
supervision
of
the
judges
of
supreme
court
power,
in
addition
to
relieving
your
client
of
the
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
asking
for
a
lot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
handler,
why,
why
waste
your
time
on
that
clearly
if
we
do?
we
may
still
treat
the
jurisdictional
statement
for
certainty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
we
postpone
jurisdiction
on
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really
you
got
more
if
i
may
suggest
to
that
i
think
you
have
more
serious
question
about
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
as
much
as
clear,
isn't
it?
if
we
agree
with
them
if
there
was
coercion
consequent
perhaps
by
reason
of
the
warning
that
the
conviction
has
to
be
reversed
then
obviously
the
statute
can
be
applied
to
these
two
fellows
that
they
did
testify,
right?
they
didn't
rely
on
the
privilege?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
we
have
to
wait
until
they
came
when
you
had
a
police
officer
who
relied
on
the
privilege
and
then
you
discharge
them
under
the
statute
before
we
have
the
course
of
question
of
constitutionality
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
we've
been
doing
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
twenty-five
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
handler
i
think
you
answered
justice
white
before
that
where
this
individual
is
not
police
officer
at
the
time
of
that
interrogation
but
private
citizens,
there
will
be
no
question
that
there
was
that
kind
of
coercion
exercise
could
violated
the
privilege?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
your
whole
case
has
to
depend
on
a
distinction
between
a
police
officer
and
a
private
citizen,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
anyway
the
only
judgment
before
us
that
judgment
of
criminal
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
add
one
last
question
if
i
may?
does
this
conviction
stand
or
fall
on
the
evidence
they
got
from
police?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
there
other
independent
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event
it
could
be
a
new
trial
i
gather
because
he
would
not
have
to
rely
on
this
testimony
that
fell,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wait

that's
