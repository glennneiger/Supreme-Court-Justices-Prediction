justice
abe
fortas
mr.
o'connor,
is
it
all
in
conflict
with
previous
position,
a
decision
charged
a
little
earlier?
as
i
understand
in
your
saying
that
the
reference
of
these
petitioners
to
the
disposal
statute
constituted
a
threat
and
now
you're
saying
that
the
reference
was
quite
as
tough
as
the
statute
in
reality
is,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
what
your
legal
point
is
the
result
of
the
--
what
point
are
you
submitting
to
us
is
the
result
of
that
--
and
the
petitioners
were
mislead?
justice
abe
fortas
the
first
part
was
that
he
was
intimidating
by
calling
their
attention
to
the
warning
to
the
dismissal
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
making
a
point
that
they
were
--
that
the
statute
we
should
reverse
here
because
the
witnesses
were
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
incriminating?
justice
abe
fortas
or
mislead
which
is
--
that
is
your
point?
what
is
your
point,
are
you
urging
that
we
should
reverse
because
the
petitioners
were
mislead
or
because
they
were
--
justice
abe
fortas
there's
a
fact
that
the
statute
existed
some
statute
was
mentioned
to
petitioners
like
any
difference.
would
your
point
be
the
same?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
the
very
--
what
you're
doing
is
to
attack
the
very
existence
of
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
the
very
existence
of
the
statute
--
justice
abe
fortas
coercion.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
actually
happened
here
is
that
the
petitioners
did
testify.
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
were
not
fired.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you're
saying
that
appears
through
several
layers
here,
don't
we
in
causation.
you're
asking
us
to
set
aside
the
judgment
on
a
count
of
the
trial
--
on
the
count
of
after
trial
their
statement
were
used
and
because
those
statements
were
subject
to
the
impairment
that's
the
existence
of
the
statute
that
comes
to
coercion.
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
in
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan
some
time
ago
that
you
did
not
make
any
point
out
of
a
procedural
posture
of
this
case
so
there's
to
say
that
it
does
not
come
here
with
--
on
the
dismissal
for
refusal
to
testify
that
the
case
comes
here
and
posture
where
the
police
officers
have
been
discharged
upon
a
calendar
conviction?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
bothers
me
because
the
essential
proposition
here
may
be
that
the
mere
existence
of
the
statute
invalidates
the
testimony
given
and
makes
that
testimony
of
course
--
justice
abe
fortas
so,
there
is
a
direct
conflict
between
your
position
and
that
stated
by
mr.
o'connor
in
that
respect?
justice
abe
fortas
conflict
with
respect
to
new
jersey
law?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
even
if
the
--
an
absolute
mandatory
statute
would
be
considered
as
--
might
be
considered
as
of
course
that
where
the
invocation
of
the
statute
requires
a
hearing
and
the
application
of
other
standards
that
the
case
may
be
different?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
o'connor,
is
