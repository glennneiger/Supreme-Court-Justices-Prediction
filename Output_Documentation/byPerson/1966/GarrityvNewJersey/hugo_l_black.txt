justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
what
you're
saying
is
that
policemen
can
be
made
--
to
give
evidence
against
difficulties
of
policemen
and
that
would
be
a
reasonable
regulation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
he's
force
to
give
evidence
against
himself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
don't
claim
any
isn't
that
the
fact
of
fitness
to
be
a
policeman,
the
policeman
claimed
to
manifest
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
avoid
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
that's
what
happened,
that's
the
way
it
function.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
to
be
added
to
it
besides
the
fact
that
he
is
a
policeman
and
has
refused
to
convict,
to
give
evidence
to
convict
himself,
what's
to
be
added
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
excuse
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would
be
within
their
right
as
i
understand
it
and
dismiss
him
from
service
those
who
had
claimed
their
benefit
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
get
down
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
fifth
amendment
means
what
it
says,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
should
they
when
they
are
kind
of
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
society
is
handicapped
by
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
precisely
how
were
they
obtained?
just
precisely
how
they
give
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
conclusion.
tell
me
what
happened.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
they
doing
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'll
get
down
to
the
point
now
where
he
told
them
under
the
law
that
they
testified,
it
could
be
used
against
them
to
convict
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
would
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
would
lose
their
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
testify
as
police
officers,
they
testified
as
human
being.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
their
alleged
conviction
of
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
that
in
saying
if
--
except
in
the
enormity
of
the
--
of
what's
done,
you
can
be
whipped
if
you
don't
do
this
and
that's
what
to
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
great
deal
of
difference
is
the
degree.
it
was
the
difference
in
the
compulsion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
his
job
was
at
stake?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
obligate
to
do
it
but
for
the
facts
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
but
suppose
for
the
matter
of
protection
around
them
so
that
they
can't
force
them
to
give
evidence
against
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
threatening
him
with
something
like
loss
of
a
job.
justice
hugo
l.
black
again,
he's
beyond
the
legal
duty
of
the
fifth
amendment
says,
he
can't
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
he
can?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
their
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
would
be
different?
i
don't
quite
understand.
you
mean
that
by
having
a
hearing
you
could
quote
him
to
give
evidence
to
get
(inaudible)?
would
it
be
the
opposite
if
you
didn't
have
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what
kind
of
employees
has
it
already
been
applied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
give
us
the
details
of
one
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
they
didn't
testify
against
themselves?
justice
hugo
l.
black
convictions
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
was
the
person
asked
about
it?
justice
