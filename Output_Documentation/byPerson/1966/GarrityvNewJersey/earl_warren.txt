chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
agree
within
to
this
extent
that
your
position
would
be
if
there
was
no
statute
that
the
fact
that
this
warning
was
given
by
the
attorney
general
to
the
effect
that
if
he
didn't
testify
there
might
be
a
proceeding
against
him
so
far
as
his
job
is
concerned
and
he
gave
it
because
of
that
threat
that
you
would
still
be
entitled
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
fine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
do
you
concede
that
if
there
wasn't
the
statute
and
this
same
warning
had
been
given
and
he
had
testified
and
the
other
things
had
resulted
that
you
would
lose
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
handler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
handler,
are
we
--
do
we
have
to
find
out
in
this
case
whether
any
one
was
legally
discharged
or
not
or
do
we
have
to
find
out
merely
that
evidence
taken
from
him
in
what
they
said
to
be
compulsory
manner
here
is
properly
introduced
in
the
criminal
proceeding
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
the
only
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
only
question
is,
was
there
coercion
in
getting
these
statements
from
these
police
officers
and
therefore
were
they
voluntary
statements
that
could
be
introduced
in
the
trial
against
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
handler,
may
i
ask
you
this?
is
it
your
position
that
any
time
a
policeman
for
instance
is
charged
with
a
crime
that
he
may
also
be
simultaneously
charged
with
or
having
an
investigation
in
the
department
of
his
conduct
and
they
immediately
have
a
hearing
on
his
conduct
and
he
says
that
he's
going
to
have
a
criminal
--
he's
got
this
criminal
case
against
him
and
he
claims
the
fifth
amendment
that
you
could
then
discharge
him
for
not
testifying
before
this
hearing
and
leaving
without
a
job
when
he's
tried
for
his
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
you
say
that
wouldn't
apply
to
all
kinds
of
employees,
what
kind
of
employees
would
it
not
apply
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
who
would
determine
what
employees
would
come
under
and
what
wouldn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
would
be
on
an
ad
hoc
basis?
