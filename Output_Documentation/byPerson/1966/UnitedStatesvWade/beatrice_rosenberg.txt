ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
comes
here
on
petition
for
--
government
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit,
which
refers
respondents
conviction
for
bank
robbery
because
it
held
that
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
been
violated
in
the
lineup.
there
is
a
lineup
which
was
held
after
indictment,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
respondent
was
arrested
after
indictment
and
after
counsel
had
been
appointed
for
him
without
notification
to
counsel.
it
does
not
appear
on
the
record,
but
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
that
after
line-up
the
persons
in
the
lineup,
i
think
there
were
six
of
them
that
doesn’t
appear
in
the
record
either,
were
asked
to
say
some
words
like,
put
the
money
in
this
bag.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
holding
first
that
the
fact
alone,
that
counsel
had
not
been
notified
of
the
decision
to
conduct
a
lineup
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
further
that
because
of
this
violation,
the
witnesses,
the
victims
of
the
robbery
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
identify
the
defendant,
the
respondent
in
court
at
all.
this
despite
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
they
had
quite
a
lot
of
time,
ample
time
to
observe
them
at
the
trial,
despite
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
at
least
one
of
them
had
picked
out
his
photographs
before
the
lineup,
before
his
arrest
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
government
on
its
own
made
no
attempt
to
make
affirmative
use
of
the
fact
that
defendant
had
been
identified
at
a
lineup,
but
that
the
whole
question
of
the
lineup
was
introduced
into
the
case
by
the
defendant.
it’s
the
government
position
that
the
court
was
wrong
on
both
aspects
of
the
decision
and
that’s
why
we
brought
the
case
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
one
in
holding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
secondly
in
the
sanctions
that
it
imposed.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
the
sixth
amendment
question,
in
our
view
the
key
to
the
problem
is
that
by
a
line
up,
that
what
the
government
is
really
seeking,
is
to
find
out
what
the
witness
knows,
the
witness,
the
victims
of
the
robbery
not
what
the
defendant
knows.
it
really
is
asking
this
question.
mr.
witness
can
you
identify
this
man?
now
the
reason
you
use
the
defendant
instead
of
using
photographs
is
because
it’s
better,
you
get
better
testimony.
if
somebody
looks
at
that
real
thing,
than
if
he
looked
at
a
photograph
and
the
reason
you
use
a
lineup
is
that
it’s
fairer,
if
you
haven’t
looked
at
six
people,
as
the
same
way
then
if
he
just
looks
at
one
person,
but
the
question
that
you
are
asking
is
the
question
of
the
witness,
do
you
recognize
him
and
this
is
true
whether
its
before
indictment
or
after
indictment.
now
the
most
frequent
use
of
a
line
up
of
course,
is
when
the
arrest
is
made
shortly
after
the
crime,
it’s
very
frequent
in
day
time
crimes,
robberies,
holdups,
so
on;
you
get
the
victims,
maybe
the
robbery
has
been
at
night
or
the
holdup
is
at
night
and
you
try
to
get
them
identified
quickly,
so
that
it’s
a
technique
for
helping
the
police
know
they’ve
the
right
man.
now
this
case
in
that
sense
is
atypical.
but
even
in
this
situation
it’s
the
same
question,
because
what
happened
here
was
that
two
accomplices
were
caught
in
another
bank
robbery
and
they
subsequently
identified
--
they
told
a
story
about
this
bank
robbery
and
named
respondent
as
a
person
who
had
gone
into
the
bank.
now
there
are
stories
checked
out
in
many
details
as
is
shown
from
the
transcript
which
isn’t
printed
here.
but
there’s
a
long
record
that
shows
that
the
story
as
to
all
the
preparations
and
so
forth
were
corroborated
in
quite
considerable
detail,
but
only
one
man
went
into
the
bank
and
they
named
respondent
as
that
man.
well,
obviously
it
was
important,
both
from
the
point
of
view
of
prior
preparation
and
bolstering
the
point
of
assurance
they
you
really
did
have
the
right
man,
that
the
victim
who
were
in
the
bank,
the
only
people
in
the
bank
when
he
was
there,
say
whether
they
could
identify
him
or
not
and
so
although
it
was
after
indictment,
it
served
an
identification
purpose
because
those
were
the
two
people
who
had
actually
seen
him
at
the
turn.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
as
i
understand
it,
no
there
is
no
record
of
it
at
all.
united
states
attorney
see
this
argument
as
we’ve
gotten
in
fact
as
far
as
we
can,
as
i
understand
it
there
were
six
people
at
the
lineup
all
dressed
alike
and
they
were
told,
each
told
to
say
the
same
thing,
“put
the
money
in
the
bag.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
police.
well
there
were
some
local
police
and
there
was
an
fbi
agent
who
were
responsible
for
the
lineup.
this
wasn’t
--
the
united
states
attorney
as
such
did
not
participate.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
this
was
not
kept
aside
from
the
trial,
all
that
happened
at
the
trial
was
the
first
witness
got
up,
she
was
the
cashier
of
the
bank,
she
was
the
one
whom
the
defendant
first
approached
and
she
testified
to
the
circumstances
of
the
robbery
that
a
man
came
in,
she
and
--
she
was
at
the
cashier’s
desk,
about
10
feet
away
from
the
entrance,
she
was
alone,
that
a
man
came
in
and
said
i
have
to
check
to
cash
and
she
said
okay,
come
here.
and
then
she
looked
up
and
he
had
a
gun
pointed
at
her
and
then
he
walked
right
close
to
her
and
said
this
is
a
holdup
and
get
the
money
and
then
she
walked
back
to
the
hall
where
the
manager
was
and
she
said
that
mr.
gray
we
are
being
robbed
and
so
the
robber
said
put
the
money
--
he
handed
her
a
pillow
case,
said
put
the
money
in
here
and
they
did,
they
put
the
money
and
then
she
--
they
both
started
to
go
out
and
the
robber
said
no,
you
stay
back
there
with
mr.
gray
like
(inaudible),
but
you
come
with
me
and
i
want
the
money
that’s
upfront
and
then
he
said
to
mr.
gray,
if
you
do
what
you
are
told
you
won’t
get
hurt
and
so
mr.
gray
went
around
and
took
the
money
upfront.
and
then
the
man
left,
and
one
of
the
accomplices
was
driving
a
getaway
car.
now
that’s
all
that
happened,
they
testified
to
that
and
they
said
do
you
see
that
man,
and
she
said,
yes,
each
of
them,
this
man
here.
well
the
first
witness,
she
just
said
i
see
this
man
and
defense
counsel
got
up
and
he
said
something
about
when
did
you
see
it
before
or
something
like
that
and
she
said,
well
i
identified
a
photograph.
that
came
out
by
then
and
then
he
asked
her
about
the
lineup.
now
defense
counsel’s
main
point
at
this
time
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
record,
was
to
bring
out
an
incident
that
happened
during
the
lineup,
which
was
that
the
lineup
was
conducted
in
a
court
room.
i’m
told
that
--
defense
counsel
tells
me
that’s
about
60
miles
from
the
place
where
the
bank
was
robbed
and
the
two
witnesses
were
seated
at
the
benches
of
court
room,
i
take
it
about
20
feet
and
then
about
where
--
as
i
understand
is
about
where
justice
harlan
and
justice
stewart
said,
there
is
an
empty
room
from
the
court
room
which
the
witnesses
called
to
pool,
apparently
an
empty
room
and
there
is
a
door
to
the
empty
room,
well
while
they
were
sitting
there
waiting
for
the
lineup,
a
door
--
(inaudible)
open,
it
swung
open
and
at
that
point
both
of
the
witnesses
said
that
they
saw
the
fbi
agent,
mrs.
gray
said
with
respondent
the
manager
and
mrs.
chamber
said,
the
cashier,
the
manager
said
he
saw
the
fbi
agent
and
a
man
who
looked
like
the
man
they
identified.
mrs.
chamber
said
this
is
just
a
glance
and
as
i
say,
the
manager
said,
it
looked
liked
that
they
entered
and
then
the
lineup
was
conducted.
it’s
really
all
the
record
shows.
then
what
the
defense
counsel
did
was
argued
to
the
jury
that
well,
how
could
they
be
sure
and
after,
when
they
saw
him
with
the
fbi
agent,
this
minute,
this
glance
and
how
could
they
be
sure
and
he
did
make
a
motion
i
will
say,
he
did
bring
out
the
fact
that
he
was
not
at
the
present
at
the
lineup
and
he
did
make
a
motion
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
present,
he
did
bring
that
out,
in
addition
to
this
incident
and
he
really
made
his
motion
basically
on
the
fact
that
he
was
not
present.
he
asked
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
or
for
exclusion
of
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses.
but
the
circumstances
of
the
lineup
were
developed
only
to
the
extent
of
bringing
out
this
incident
which
one
of
the
witnesses
says
was
just
a
glance,
it
was
the
court
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
is
my
understanding
that
no
questions
were
asked
in
that
sense.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
the
record
does
show
defense
counsel
did
bring
out
the
fact
he
has
been
appointed
on
april
26th
at
arraignment.
the
dates
on
this
are
that
on
september
16th,
the
offence
was
committed.
the
indictment
was
retained
on
march
23,
1965,
long
time
this
was
an
unsolved
robbery.
the
petitioner
was
arrested
i
think
not
in
texas
on
april
2nd
and
counsel
was
appointed
for
him
at
arraignment
on
april
26th.
the
lineup
was
held
on
may
10th,
the
trial
was
in
august
and
his
--
this
was
tried
except
for
that
incident.
i
mean
the
motion
was
based
on
the
fact
that
counsel
was
not
present
at
the
lineup.
there
was
no
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
he
has
not
been
notified
of
the
line
up
and
so
it
comes
to
you
in
a
sense
on
the
fifth,
sixth
amendment
problem,
--
the
question,
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
asked
counsel
about
what
happened
and
he
told
them,
and
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
asked
to
speak,
but
the
fact
of
that
didn’t
even
come
out
at
the
trial.
there
is
not
one
thing
in
the
record
on
that,
and
our
petition
on
the
sixth
amendment
is
simply
that
a
line
up
is
basically
in
its
function
and
in
the
purpose
not
different
from
intervening
a
witness
either
as
an
investigation
or
as
preparation
for
a
trial
and
in
neither
case
on
our
system
of
government
is
that
an
adversary,
cooperative
type
of
thing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
but
i’m
saying
witness
because
our
whole
point
on
the
sixth
amendment
is
that
what
you
are
trying
to
get
is
the
question
of
what
the
witness
knows.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
let
me
say
i
think
you
have
to
separate
the
question.
the
mere
conducting
of
a
lineup
is
--
i
understand
the
decision
below
and
the
position
of
counsel
is
if
by
virtue
of
the
fact
if
you
simply
paraded
them
across
the
hall
and
said
not
one
word,
asked
them
nothing
that
if
counsel
was
not
notified
that
in
and
of
itself.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
so
long
as
the
government
--
if
the
government
goes
beyond
what
i
consider
the
function
of
a
line
up,
if
it
abuses
it
then
there
is
another
problem.
now
if
--
as
our
provision
is
that
so
long
as
a
line
up
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
is
not
--
that’s
right,
our
position
is
not
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
because
then
you
would
trying
to
find
out
what
the
defendant
knows.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
which
the
fifth?
you
are
asking
about
it?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
is
both
i
take
it
under
miranda.
i
mean
i
find
that
it’s
certain
times
hard
to
draw
the
lines
but
i
take
it
under
miranda
it
would
be
both.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
take
miranda
to
be
a
combination
of
the
fifth
and
sixth.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
would
be
a
violation
of
miranda
anyway.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that’s
right,
after
indictment
certainly,
but
i
take
it
that
and
let
me
say
that’s
in
a
sense
why
we
here
on
the
merit
let’s
say
because
the
question
of
notifying
him
as
a
matter
of
what
do
i
say,
running
a
police
department
or
procedures
where
a
defendant
has
that
counsel
–-
they
might
prepared
for
argument
one
way
or
another,
i
don’t
know,
but
if
you
appeal
to
a
constitutional
right
under
sixth
amendment
then
it
does
create
real
problem
because
it
is
a
constitutional
right,
then
it
attaches
--
well
at
least
as
soon
as
man
is
arrested,
and
it
mean
that
you
can’t
conduct
a
lineup
until
counsel
has
been
appointed
for
him,
unless
there
is
a
knowing
explicit
way
for
it
and
it
means
that
you
can’t
conduct
a
line
up,
unless
counsel
is
present,
unless
there
is
a
knowing,
an
explicit
waiver.
now,
there
are
parts
of
the
country
where
you
can
conduct
a
line
up
and
where
you
can
get
counsel
appointed
just
the
minute
the
man
is
arrested.
it
doesn’t
--
some
places
big
cities
you
can,
but
the
most
--
in
many
places
you
can’t.
certainly,
if
the
lawyer
has
to
be
present
without
knowing
an
explicit
waiver,
lawyers
are
busy.
i
mean
sometimes,
in
this
case
the
witnesses
had
to
be
brought
60
miles.
lawyers
had
to
be
on
trial
again.
lawyer
can
pretend
to
be
busy.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
purposely
makes
the
difference
because
i
never
thought
the
trial
preparation.
the
government
trial
preparation
is
something
--
not
something
in
which
the
defense
participates.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now
in
many
--
oh
i
am
sorry.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
my
problem
with
that
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
i
don’t
see
that
the
sixth
--
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court,
if
it’s
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
i
don’t
see
how
it
can
attach
(inaudible)
and
take
this
case
as
i
say,
he
was
indicted
before
he
was
ever
picked
up.
now
the
first
chance
that
he
had
to
confront
the
witnesses
and
the
defendant
to
make
sure
they
had
the
right
man
as
well,
you
know
obviously
what
they
would
testify
to
the
trial.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
not,
well
they
did
have
a
good
idea,
there
is
no
question
about
that
they
had
the
concessions
of
confederate
and
they
had,
had
people
look
at
photographs.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
said
--
i
am
sorry
i
don’t
think
that’s
not
what
i
said,
i
said
to
the
extent
that
the
government
tried
to
find
out
what
the
defendant
knows,
instead
of
what
the
witness
knows,
then
we
have
a
completely
different
question
and
therefore
i
am
confining
my
argument
to
a
lineup
in
which
the
defendant
--
the
government
tries
to
find
out
only
what
the
witness
knows.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
we
have
due
process
question
--
i
think
we
would
have
to
a
due
process
question
--
that
is
i
think
that
--
if
the
government
used
forgery
to
get
a
handwriting
testimony,
the
government
would
be
happy
(inaudible).
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
(voice
overlap)
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
seems
to
be
involved
--
pardon.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
i
thought
you
were
through,
i
am
sorry.
i
was
saying
it
seems
to
me
that
it
involves
a
tremendous
change
in
our
system,
because
i
suppose
anytime
you
interview
a
witness,
you
could
have
a
due
process
question.
anytime
you
use
in
a
ballistic
expert,
you
can
have
a
due
process
question.
anytime
–
well
just
any
piece
of
evidence.
if
we’re
going
to
have
a
joint
development
of
evidence
between
counsel
for
the
government
and
counsel
for
the
defense,
that’s
a
revolutionary
change
in
our
methods.
sorry.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
just
wanted
to
take
up
this
matter
of
indictment.
very
often
it
is
really
happened
today
whether
the
indictment
in
return
or
not.
of
course
the
sooner
you
get
a
man
in
some
respect,
if
you
arraign
him
promptly
and
recognize
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
but
as
soon
as
you
have
probable
cause
you
should
take
step
to
arraign
him,
to
charge
him
and
so
on.
obviously
a
great
deal
of
interviewing
of
witnesses,
preparation,
all
kinds
of
tests
goes
on
after
indictment.
now
this
case
is
a
little
different,
the
reason
for
the
delay
here
is
different,
this
was
an
unsolved
crime
for
a
long
time,
they
knew
there
was
a
bank
robbery,
they
didn’t
know
who
did
it.
then
these
two
men
were
caught
in
a
quite
different
bank
robbery
and
eventually,
this
took
them
time
to
do.
they
talked
about
this
particular
robbery
and
the
stories
were
checked
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
before
the
court,
but
shows
up
in
the
transcript,
a
lot
of
their
story
was
checked
but
as
i
think
i
said
before
according
to
their
story
and
according
to
facts
of
the
robbery
one
man
with
in
the
bank.
now
the
indictment
was
returned
before
these
men
were
arrested.
but
obviously,
the
way
you
see
whether
the
final
corroboration
of
these
accomplices
was
to
have
the
people
who
where
in
the
robbery
look
at
it,
that’s
what
this
lineup
was
for,
if
you
call
it
preparation
for
trail
in
one
sense
of
course
it
was
but
it
was
also
identification
in
the
same
way
that
identification
is
used
where
a
man
is
called
earlier
and
that’s
why
it
seems
to
be
an
artificial
line
to
try
to
draw
it
before
or
after
indictment,
so
long
as
the
(inaudilbe)
confines
himself
to
finding
out
what
the
witness
can
say
and
doesn’t
try
to
get
information
as
such
for
the
defendant
and
that
brings
me
to
the
subject
of
the
remedy,
on
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
i
think
stands
alone,
so
far
as
i
know.
the
defendants
in
the
next
case
would
have
said
merely
that
the
government
could
not
make
affirmative
use
of
the
lineup
identification,
well
the
government
in
this
case
didn’t
try
to,
they
didn’t
even
bring
out
that
the
witness
had
identified
photographs.
this
came
in
originally
--
brought
in
by
the
defense,
what
the
government
relied
on
was
that
the
witness
had
really
quite
a
long
time
to
identify
the
robber
and
they
did
identify
him
in
the
courtroom.
the
government
didn’t
bring
him
in
the
lineup
at
all.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
(inaudible)
so
hold
your
honor.
there
have
been
--
the
rule
on
whether
you
can
offer
proof
of
identification
at
a
lineup,
if
that’s
what
--
if
you’re
taking
about
that
rule
of
evidence,
the
federal
cases
say
that
you
may,
that
this
as
an
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule.
if
you
are
talking
about
the
question
of
whether
the
lineup
as
such
is
a
violation
of
constitutional
right,
i
think
that
is
the
question
on
which
the
court
disagreed
in
schmerber,
on
the
view
your
honor
expressed
there,
i
take
it
that
having
a
man
even
stand
up
to
the
extent
that
the
witness
looks
at
him
for
that
purpose
and
certainly
from
your
honor’s
point
of
view
having
him
repeat
any
word
would
have
been
a
violation.
as
i
understand
the
majority
opinion
in
schmerber,
the
court
held
to
the
contrary
that,
that
was
not
a
violation
of
constitutional
right,
because
you
were
not
getting
from
the
witness
what
he
knew
and
let
me
say
that
is
about
on
the
assumption
of
the
fact
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
let
me
put
it
--
exactly
what
happened.
the
first
witness
was
mrs.
chambers
and
on
her
testimony
the
government
made
absolutely
no
mention
of
it
all.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
she
was
not
questioned
about
--
nothing
would
said
about
it.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
cross
examination
counsel
asked
her
whether
she
had
seen
the
defendant
between
the
time
of
the
offense,
of
the
time
of
the
trial,
and
she
first
said
she
had
picked
that
photograph.
well
i
don’t
think
she
said
that
first,
she
said
she
had
seen
him
at
the
lineup.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
she
said
she
had
seen
him
at
the
lineup
and
then
there
was
some
question,
had
she
seen
anything
before
and
she
said,
she
had
seen
photographs
before
the
lineup.
then
the
mr.
gray
came
up
and
he
--
again
the
government
asked
him
about
the
effect
--
about
the
facts
of
the
robbery.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
it
said
did
you
see
this
defendant
in
this
courtroom
on
the
tenth?
but
this
was
after
there
had
been
all
this
cross
examination
about
the
lineup.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that’s
right.
but
that’s
was
all
and
then
the
defense
court
examined
him.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
then
the
defense
cross-examined
and
the
defense
cross-examined
him
with
reference
to
this
info
tro
that
where
we
got
this
pleading
glance
through
the
--
when
the
door
opened.
the
government
did
never
--
did
not
--
in
mrs.
chamber’s
testimony,
not
one
mention
of
the
lineup.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
except
what
--
on
the
second
witness
there
was
this
one
line,
the
government
did
ask
one
question
at
the
end
of
the
second
witness,
after
the
defense
had
brought
it
out
for
the
first
time.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
there
have
been
two
suggestions
by
defending
opinion
in
the
federal
gilbert
case
about
which
it
held
and
that
in
the
next
case
and
so
forth,
by
courts
that
have
held
that
there
was
violation
of
rights.
one
suggestion
is
that
the
government
be
barred
from
affirmatively
bringing
before
the
jury
and
of
course
that
wasn’t
done
in
this
case,
any
evidence
that
the
lineup
identification
had
been
met.
so
that
--
because
in
many
cases
where
it’s
very
close
to
time,
this
may
be
more
significant
than
it
was
in
this
case,
that
kind
of
remedy.
the
other
suggestion
that
has
been
made
for
a
remedy
is
judge
browning
(ph)
suggestion
in
the
defense
in
the
federal
gilbert
case
which
is
that
where
a
court
feels
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
right,
that
there
be
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
determine
as
near
as
one
can,
all
law
requires
some
weighing,
some
evidence,
how
much
opportunity
did
the
witness
have
to
see
the
defendant
at
that
time
of
the
crime.
how
certain
--
how
--
had
he
identified
them
before
the
lineup?
in
other
words,
can
one
say
with
a
reasonable
degree
of
certainty
that
the
identification,
the
knowledge
of
the
looks
of
this
man
came
long
before
the
lineup
or
if
it’s
so
doubtful
and
are
the
circumstances
such
that
you
can’t
honestly
say
that
the
identification
--
the
original
identification
at
the
lineup
--
suppose
the
first
time
you
identified
him
as
a
lineup,
let’s
assume
it
was
–
that’s
very
unfair
lineup
that
mr.
justice
fortas
put
to
me
as
a
hypothetical
question.
the
action
there
is
that
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
you’d
say
well
the
chances
are
that
his
identification
in
the
courtrooms
stems
from
the
illegal
lineup,
we
won’t
allow
him
to
identify
in
the
courtroom.
but
where
the
evidence
shows
very
clearly
that
the
witness
did
have
lots
of
opportunity
to
observe
and
that
the
--
that
the
lineup
legal
or
illegal
was
not
the
major
factor,
then
we
will
allow
the
witness
to
identify
in
the
courtroom,
but
i
presume
not
show
if
some
question
is
raised,
not
allow
him
to
show
that
he
did
it
three
months
before
or
six
months
before
at
the
lineup.
and
when
you
considered,
that
this
is
not
the
problem
that
the
court
was
dealing
with
in
miranda,
that
is
rule
--
a
line
up
is
really
basically
designed
to
be
there.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
designed
to
be
there
because
a
line
up
as
conducted
is
done
so
that
witness
sees
several
people
rather
than
one,
it
doesn’t
have
any
of
the
potentialities
of
the
evil,
which
this
court
was
dealing
with
in
miranda
and
that
it
was
trying
to
avoid,
to
what
it
found
to
be
--
and
i
suppose
in
same
cases
actually
have
it
found
to
be
potentialities
is
nothing
that
a
line
up
is
secret,
the
witnesses
are
there,
people
are
there,
it’s
a
short
duration,
it
can’t
be
long,
its
basically
designed
to
be
a
fair
procedure,
maybe
in
this
case
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
yes
but
i
mean
it’s
certainly
easier
to
take
him
down
--
to
identify
this
man
in
this
cell.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
what
you
want
to
call
it,
it’s
a
fairer
method.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
it
was
a
fair
method?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don’t
know.
i
have
not
found
prosecutors
interested
in
convicting
innocent.
sometimes
they
get
mistaken
though
i’m
not
saying
that.
i
have
found
prosecutors
who
have
asked
ahead
of
time,
have
tried
to
be
assured
of
themselves,
they
sometimes
are
convinced
that
someone
and
maybe
mistakenly
convinced,
there
maybe
occasionally
people
who
are
put.
but
i
doubt
things
by
and
large,
people
are
seeing
united
states
attorneys
offices,
are
out
to
convict
a
man
at
any
court.
they
want
to
know
they
have
the
right
man,
yes
i
think
they
do.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
comes
here
on
petition
for
--
government
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit,
which
refers
respondents
conviction
for
bank
robbery
because
it
held
that
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
been
violated
in
the
lineup.
there
is
a
lineup
which
was
held
after
indictment,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
respondent
was
arrested
after
indictment
and
after
counsel
had
been
appointed
for
him
without
notification
to
counsel.
it
does
not
appear
on
the
record,
but
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
that
after
line-up
the
persons
in
the
lineup,
i
think
there
were
six
of
them
that
doesn’t
appear
in
the
record
either,
were
asked
to
say
some
words
like,
put
the
money
in
this
bag.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
holding
first
that
the
fact
alone,
that
counsel
had
not
been
notified
of
the
decision
to
conduct
a
lineup
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
further
that
because
of
this
violation,
the
witnesses,
the
victims
of
the
robbery
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
identify
the
defendant,
the
respondent
in
court
at
all.
this
despite
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
they
had
quite
a
lot
of
time,
ample
time
to
observe
them
at
the
trial,
despite
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
at
least
one
of
them
had
picked
out
his
photographs
before
the
lineup,
before
his
arrest
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
government
on
its
own
made
no
attempt
to
make
affirmative
use
of
the
fact
that
defendant
had
been
identified
at
a
lineup,
but
that
the
whole
question
of
the
lineup
was
introduced
into
the
case
by
the
defendant.
it’s
the
government
position
that
the
court
was
wrong
on
both
aspects
of
the
decision
and
that’s
why
we
brought
the
case
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
one
in
holding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
secondly
in
the
sanctions
that
it
imposed.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
the
sixth
amendment
question,
in
our
view
the
key
to
the
problem
is
that
by
a
line
up,
that
what
the
government
is
really
seeking,
is
to
find
out
what
the
witness
knows,
the
witness,
the
victims
of
the
robbery
not
what
the
defendant
knows.
it
really
is
asking
this
question.
mr.
witness
can
you
identify
this
man?
now
the
reason
you
use
the
defendant
instead
of
using
photographs
is
because
it’s
better,
you
get
better
testimony.
if
somebody
looks
at
that
real
thing,
than
if
he
looked
at
a
photograph
and
the
reason
you
use
a
lineup
is
that
it’s
fairer,
if
you
haven’t
looked
at
six
people,
as
the
same
way
then
if
he
just
looks
at
one
person,
but
the
question
that
you
are
asking
is
the
question
of
the
witness,
do
you
recognize
him
and
this
is
true
whether
its
before
indictment
or
after
indictment.
now
the
most
frequent
use
of
a
line
up
of
course,
is
when
the
arrest
is
made
shortly
after
the
crime,
it’s
very
frequent
in
day
time
crimes,
robberies,
holdups,
so
on;
you
get
the
victims,
maybe
the
robbery
has
been
at
night
or
the
holdup
is
at
night
and
you
try
to
get
them
identified
quickly,
so
that
it’s
a
technique
for
helping
the
police
know
they’ve
the
right
man.
now
this
case
in
that
sense
is
atypical.
but
even
in
this
situation
it’s
the
same
question,
because
what
happened
here
was
that
two
accomplices
were
caught
in
another
bank
robbery
and
they
subsequently
identified
--
they
told
a
story
about
this
bank
robbery
and
named
respondent
as
a
person
who
had
gone
into
the
bank.
now
there
are
stories
checked
out
in
many
details
as
is
shown
from
the
transcript
which
isn’t
printed
here.
but
there’s
a
long
record
that
shows
that
the
story
as
to
all
the
preparations
and
so
forth
were
corroborated
in
quite
considerable
detail,
but
only
one
man
went
into
the
bank
and
they
named
respondent
as
that
man.
well,
obviously
it
was
important,
both
from
the
point
of
view
of
prior
preparation
and
bolstering
the
point
of
assurance
they
you
really
did
have
the
right
man,
that
the
victim
who
were
in
the
bank,
the
only
people
in
the
bank
when
he
was
there,
say
whether
they
could
identify
him
or
not
and
so
although
it
was
after
indictment,
it
served
an
identification
purpose
because
those
were
the
two
people
who
had
actually
seen
him
at
the
turn.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
as
i
understand
it,
no
there
is
no
record
of
it
at
all.
united
states
attorney
see
this
argument
as
we’ve
gotten
in
fact
as
far
as
we
can,
as
i
understand
it
there
were
six
people
at
the
lineup
all
dressed
alike
and
they
were
told,
each
told
to
say
the
same
thing,
“put
the
money
in
the
bag.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
police.
well
there
were
some
local
police
and
there
was
an
fbi
agent
who
were
responsible
for
the
lineup.
this
wasn’t
--
the
united
states
attorney
as
such
did
not
participate.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
this
was
not
kept
aside
from
the
trial,
all
that
happened
at
the
trial
was
the
first
witness
got
up,
she
was
the
cashier
of
the
bank,
she
was
the
one
whom
the
defendant
first
approached
and
she
testified
to
the
circumstances
of
the
robbery
that
a
man
came
in,
she
and
--
she
was
at
the
cashier’s
desk,
about
10
feet
away
from
the
entrance,
she
was
alone,
that
a
man
came
in
and
said
i
have
to
check
to
cash
and
she
said
okay,
come
here.
and
then
she
looked
up
and
he
had
a
gun
pointed
at
her
and
then
he
walked
right
close
to
her
and
said
this
is
a
holdup
and
get
the
money
and
then
she
walked
back
to
the
hall
where
the
manager
was
and
she
said
that
mr.
gray
we
are
being
robbed
and
so
the
robber
said
put
the
money
--
he
handed
her
a
pillow
case,
said
put
the
money
in
here
and
they
did,
they
put
the
money
and
then
she
--
they
both
started
to
go
out
and
the
robber
said
no,
you
stay
back
there
with
mr.
gray
like
(inaudible),
but
you
come
with
me
and
i
want
the
money
that’s
upfront
and
then
he
said
to
mr.
gray,
if
you
do
what
you
are
told
you
won’t
get
hurt
and
so
mr.
gray
went
around
and
took
the
money
upfront.
and
then
the
man
left,
and
one
of
the
accomplices
was
driving
a
getaway
car.
now
that’s
all
that
happened,
they
testified
to
that
and
they
said
do
you
see
that
man,
and
she
said,
yes,
each
of
them,
this
man
here.
well
the
first
witness,
she
just
said
i
see
this
man
and
defense
counsel
got
up
and
he
said
something
about
when
did
you
see
it
before
or
something
like
that
and
she
said,
well
i
identified
a
photograph.
that
came
out
by
then
and
then
he
asked
her
about
the
lineup.
now
defense
counsel’s
main
point
at
this
time
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
record,
was
to
bring
out
an
incident
that
happened
during
the
lineup,
which
was
that
the
lineup
was
conducted
in
a
court
room.
i’m
told
that
--
defense
counsel
tells
me
that’s
about
60
miles
from
the
place
where
the
bank
was
robbed
and
the
two
witnesses
were
seated
at
the
benches
of
court
room,
i
take
it
about
20
feet
and
then
about
where
--
as
i
understand
is
about
where
justice
harlan
and
justice
stewart
said,
there
is
an
empty
room
from
the
court
room
which
the
witnesses
called
to
pool,
apparently
an
empty
room
and
there
is
a
door
to
the
empty
room,
well
while
they
were
sitting
there
waiting
for
the
lineup,
a
door
--
(inaudible)
open,
it
swung
open
and
at
that
point
both
of
the
witnesses
said
that
they
saw
the
fbi
agent,
mrs.
gray
said
with
respondent
the
manager
and
mrs.
chamber
said,
the
cashier,
the
manager
said
he
saw
the
fbi
agent
and
a
man
who
looked
like
the
man
they
identified.
mrs.
chamber
said
this
is
just
a
glance
and
as
i
say,
the
manager
said,
it
looked
liked
that
they
entered
and
then
the
lineup
was
conducted.
it’s
really
all
the
record
shows.
then
what
the
defense
counsel
did
was
argued
to
the
jury
that
well,
how
could
they
be
sure
and
after,
when
they
saw
him
with
the
fbi
agent,
this
minute,
this
glance
and
how
could
they
be
sure
and
he
did
make
a
motion
i
will
say,
he
did
bring
out
the
fact
that
he
was
not
at
the
present
at
the
lineup
and
he
did
make
a
motion
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
present,
he
did
bring
that
out,
in
addition
to
this
incident
and
he
really
made
his
motion
basically
on
the
fact
that
he
was
not
present.
he
asked
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
or
for
exclusion
of
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses.
but
the
circumstances
of
the
lineup
were
developed
only
to
the
extent
of
bringing
out
this
incident
which
one
of
the
witnesses
says
was
just
a
glance,
it
was
the
court
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
is
my
understanding
that
no
questions
were
asked
in
that
sense.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
the
record
does
show
defense
counsel
did
bring
out
the
fact
he
has
been
appointed
on
april
26th
at
arraignment.
the
dates
on
this
are
that
on
september
16th,
the
offence
was
committed.
the
indictment
was
retained
on
march
23,
1965,
long
time
this
was
an
unsolved
robbery.
the
petitioner
was
arrested
i
think
not
in
texas
on
april
2nd
and
counsel
was
appointed
for
him
at
arraignment
on
april
26th.
the
lineup
was
held
on
may
10th,
the
trial
was
in
august
and
his
--
this
was
tried
except
for
that
incident.
i
mean
the
motion
was
based
on
the
fact
that
counsel
was
not
present
at
the
lineup.
there
was
no
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
he
has
not
been
notified
of
the
line
up
and
so
it
comes
to
you
in
a
sense
on
the
fifth,
sixth
amendment
problem,
--
the
question,
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
asked
counsel
about
what
happened
and
he
told
them,
and
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
asked
to
speak,
but
the
fact
of
that
didn’t
even
come
out
at
the
trial.
there
is
not
one
thing
in
the
record
on
that,
and
our
petition
on
the
sixth
amendment
is
simply
that
a
line
up
is
basically
in
its
function
and
in
the
purpose
not
different
from
intervening
a
witness
either
as
an
investigation
or
as
preparation
for
a
trial
and
in
neither
case
on
our
system
of
government
is
that
an
adversary,
cooperative
type
of
thing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
but
i’m
saying
witness
because
our
whole
point
on
the
sixth
amendment
is
that
what
you
are
trying
to
get
is
the
question
of
what
the
witness
knows.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
let
me
say
i
think
you
have
to
separate
the
question.
the
mere
conducting
of
a
lineup
is
--
i
understand
the
decision
below
and
the
position
of
counsel
is
if
by
virtue
of
the
fact
if
you
simply
paraded
them
across
the
hall
and
said
not
one
word,
asked
them
nothing
that
if
counsel
was
not
notified
that
in
and
of
itself.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
so
long
as
the
government
--
if
the
government
goes
beyond
what
i
consider
the
function
of
a
line
up,
if
it
abuses
it
then
there
is
another
problem.
now
if
--
as
our
provision
is
that
so
long
as
a
line
up
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
is
not
--
that’s
right,
our
position
is
not
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
because
then
you
would
trying
to
find
out
what
the
defendant
knows.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
which
the
fifth?
you
are
asking
about
it?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
is
both
i
take
it
under
miranda.
i
mean
i
find
that
it’s
certain
times
hard
to
draw
the
lines
but
i
take
it
under
miranda
it
would
be
both.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
take
miranda
to
be
a
combination
of
the
fifth
and
sixth.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
would
be
a
violation
of
miranda
anyway.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that’s
right,
after
indictment
certainly,
but
i
take
it
that
and
let
me
say
that’s
in
a
sense
why
we
here
on
the
merit
let’s
say
because
the
question
of
notifying
him
as
a
matter
of
what
do
i
say,
running
a
police
department
or
procedures
where
a
defendant
has
that
counsel
–-
they
might
prepared
for
argument
one
way
or
another,
i
don’t
know,
but
if
you
appeal
to
a
constitutional
right
under
sixth
amendment
then
it
does
create
real
problem
because
it
is
a
constitutional
right,
then
it
attaches
--
well
at
least
as
soon
as
man
is
arrested,
and
it
mean
that
you
can’t
conduct
a
lineup
until
counsel
has
been
appointed
for
him,
unless
there
is
a
knowing
explicit
way
for
it
and
it
means
that
you
can’t
conduct
a
line
up,
unless
counsel
is
present,
unless
there
is
a
knowing,
an
explicit
waiver.
now,
there
are
parts
of
the
country
where
you
can
conduct
a
line
up
and
where
you
can
get
counsel
appointed
just
the
minute
the
man
is
arrested.
it
doesn’t
--
some
places
big
cities
you
can,
but
the
most
--
in
many
places
you
can’t.
certainly,
if
the
lawyer
has
to
be
present
without
knowing
an
explicit
waiver,
lawyers
are
busy.
i
mean
sometimes,
in
this
case
the
witnesses
had
to
be
brought
60
miles.
lawyers
had
to
be
on
trial
again.
lawyer
can
pretend
to
be
busy.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
purposely
makes
the
difference
because
i
never
thought
the
trial
preparation.
the
government
trial
preparation
is
something
--
not
something
in
which
the
defense
participates.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now
in
many
--
oh
i
am
sorry.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
my
problem
with
that
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
i
don’t
see
that
the
sixth
--
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court,
if
it’s
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
i
don’t
see
how
it
can
attach
(inaudible)
and
take
this
case
as
i
say,
he
was
indicted
before
he
was
ever
picked
up.
now
the
first
chance
that
he
had
to
confront
the
witnesses
and
the
defendant
to
make
sure
they
had
the
right
man
as
well,
you
know
obviously
what
they
would
testify
to
the
trial.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
not,
well
they
did
have
a
good
idea,
there
is
no
question
about
that
they
had
the
concessions
of
confederate
and
they
had,
had
people
look
at
photographs.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
said
--
i
am
sorry
i
don’t
think
that’s
not
what
i
said,
i
said
to
the
extent
that
the
government
tried
to
find
out
what
the
defendant
knows,
instead
of
what
the
witness
knows,
then
we
have
a
completely
different
question
and
therefore
i
am
confining
my
argument
to
a
lineup
in
which
the
defendant
--
the
government
tries
to
find
out
only
what
the
witness
knows.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
we
have
due
process
question
--
i
think
we
would
have
to
a
due
process
question
--
that
is
i
think
that
--
if
the
government
used
forgery
to
get
a
handwriting
testimony,
the
government
would
be
happy
(inaudible).
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
(voice
overlap)
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
seems
to
be
involved
--
pardon.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
i
thought
you
were
through,
i
am
sorry.
i
was
saying
it
seems
to
me
that
it
involves
a
tremendous
change
in
our
system,
because
i
suppose
anytime
you
interview
a
witness,
you
could
have
a
due
process
question.
anytime
you
use
in
a
ballistic
expert,
you
can
have
a
due
process
question.
anytime
–
well
just
any
piece
of
evidence.
if
we’re
going
to
have
a
joint
development
of
evidence
between
counsel
for
the
government
and
counsel
for
the
defense,
that’s
a
revolutionary
change
in
our
methods.
sorry.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
just
wanted
to
take
up
this
matter
of
indictment.
very
often
it
is
really
happened
today
whether
the
indictment
in
return
or
not.
of
course
the
sooner
you
get
a
man
in
some
respect,
if
you
arraign
him
promptly
and
recognize
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
but
as
soon
as
you
have
probable
cause
you
should
take
step
to
arraign
him,
to
charge
him
and
so
on.
obviously
a
great
deal
of
interviewing
of
witnesses,
preparation,
all
kinds
of
tests
goes
on
after
indictment.
now
this
case
is
a
little
different,
the
reason
for
the
delay
here
is
different,
this
was
an
unsolved
crime
for
a
long
time,
they
knew
there
was
a
bank
robbery,
they
didn’t
know
who
did
it.
then
these
two
men
were
caught
in
a
quite
different
bank
robbery
and
eventually,
this
took
them
time
to
do.
they
talked
about
this
particular
robbery
and
the
stories
were
checked
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
before
the
court,
but
shows
up
in
the
transcript,
a
lot
of
their
story
was
checked
but
as
i
think
i
said
before
according
to
their
story
and
according
to
facts
of
the
robbery
one
man
with
in
the
bank.
now
the
indictment
was
returned
before
these
men
were
arrested.
but
obviously,
the
way
you
see
whether
the
final
corroboration
of
these
accomplices
was
to
have
the
people
who
where
in
the
robbery
look
at
it,
that’s
what
this
lineup
was
for,
if
you
call
it
preparation
for
trail
in
one
sense
of
course
it
was
but
it
was
also
identification
in
the
same
way
that
identification
is
used
where
a
man
is
called
earlier
and
that’s
why
it
seems
to
be
an
artificial
line
to
try
to
draw
it
before
or
after
indictment,
so
long
as
the
(inaudilbe)
confines
himself
to
finding
out
what
the
witness
can
say
and
doesn’t
try
to
get
information
as
such
for
the
defendant
and
that
brings
me
to
the
subject
of
the
remedy,
on
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
i
think
stands
alone,
so
far
as
i
know.
the
defendants
in
the
next
case
would
have
said
merely
that
the
government
could
not
make
affirmative
use
of
the
lineup
identification,
well
the
government
in
this
case
didn’t
try
to,
they
didn’t
even
bring
out
that
the
witness
had
identified
photographs.
this
came
in
originally
--
brought
in
by
the
defense,
what
the
government
relied
on
was
that
the
witness
had
really
quite
a
long
time
to
identify
the
robber
and
they
did
identify
him
in
the
courtroom.
the
government
didn’t
bring
him
in
the
lineup
at
all.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
(inaudible)
so
hold
your
honor.
there
have
been
--
the
rule
on
whether
you
can
offer
proof
of
identification
at
a
lineup,
if
that’s
what
--
if
you’re
taking
about
that
rule
of
evidence,
the
federal
cases
say
that
you
may,
that
this
as
an
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule.
if
you
are
talking
about
the
question
of
whether
the
lineup
as
such
is
a
violation
of
constitutional
right,
i
think
that
is
the
question
on
which
the
court
disagreed
in
schmerber,
on
the
view
your
honor
expressed
there,
i
take
it
that
having
a
man
even
stand
up
to
the
extent
that
the
witness
looks
at
him
for
that
purpose
and
certainly
from
your
honor’s
point
of
view
having
him
repeat
any
word
would
have
been
a
violation.
as
i
understand
the
majority
opinion
in
schmerber,
the
court
held
to
the
contrary
that,
that
was
not
a
violation
of
constitutional
right,
because
you
were
not
getting
from
the
witness
what
he
knew
and
let
me
say
that
is
about
on
the
assumption
of
the
fact
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
let
me
put
it
--
exactly
what
happened.
the
first
witness
was
mrs.
chambers
and
on
her
testimony
the
government
made
absolutely
no
mention
of
it
all.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
she
was
not
questioned
about
--
nothing
would
said
about
it.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
cross
examination
counsel
asked
her
whether
she
had
seen
the
defendant
between
the
time
of
the
offense,
of
the
time
of
the
trial,
and
she
first
said
she
had
picked
that
photograph.
well
i
don’t
think
she
said
that
first,
she
said
she
had
seen
him
at
the
lineup.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
she
said
she
had
seen
him
at
the
lineup
and
then
there
was
some
question,
had
she
seen
anything
before
and
she
said,
she
had
seen
photographs
before
the
lineup.
then
the
mr.
gray
came
up
and
he
--
again
the
government
asked
him
about
the
effect
--
about
the
facts
of
the
robbery.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
it
said
did
you
see
this
defendant
in
this
courtroom
on
the
tenth?
but
this
was
after
there
had
been
all
this
cross
examination
about
the
lineup.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that’s
right.
but
that’s
was
all
and
then
the
defense
court
examined
him.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
then
the
defense
cross-examined
and
the
defense
cross-examined
him
with
reference
to
this
info
tro
that
where
we
got
this
pleading
glance
through
the
--
when
the
door
opened.
the
government
did
never
--
did
not
--
in
mrs.
chamber’s
testimony,
not
one
mention
of
the
lineup.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
except
what
--
on
the
second
witness
there
was
this
one
line,
the
government
did
ask
one
question
at
the
end
of
the
second
witness,
after
the
defense
had
brought
it
out
for
the
first
time.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
there
have
been
two
suggestions
by
defending
opinion
in
the
federal
gilbert
case
about
which
it
held
and
that
in
the
next
case
and
so
forth,
by
courts
that
have
held
that
there
was
violation
of
rights.
one
suggestion
is
that
the
government
be
barred
from
affirmatively
bringing
before
the
jury
and
of
course
that
wasn’t
done
in
this
case,
any
evidence
that
the
lineup
identification
had
been
met.
so
that
--
because
in
many
cases
where
it’s
very
close
to
time,
this
may
be
more
significant
than
it
was
in
this
case,
that
kind
of
remedy.
the
other
suggestion
that
has
been
made
for
a
remedy
is
judge
browning
(ph)
suggestion
in
the
defense
in
the
federal
gilbert
case
which
is
that
where
a
court
feels
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
right,
that
there
be
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
determine
as
near
as
one
can,
all
law
requires
some
weighing,
some
evidence,
how
much
opportunity
did
the
witness
have
to
see
the
defendant
at
that
time
of
the
crime.
how
certain
--
how
--
had
he
identified
them
before
the
lineup?
in
other
words,
can
one
say
with
a
reasonable
degree
of
certainty
that
the
identification,
the
knowledge
of
the
looks
of
this
man
came
long
before
the
lineup
or
if
it’s
so
doubtful
and
are
the
circumstances
such
that
you
can’t
honestly
say
that
the
identification
--
the
original
identification
at
the
lineup
--
suppose
the
first
time
you
identified
him
as
a
lineup,
let’s
assume
it
was
–
that’s
very
unfair
lineup
that
mr.
justice
fortas
put
to
me
as
a
hypothetical
question.
the
action
there
is
that
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
you’d
say
well
the
chances
are
that
his
identification
in
the
courtrooms
stems
from
the
illegal
lineup,
we
won’t
allow
him
to
identify
in
the
courtroom.
but
where
the
evidence
shows
very
clearly
that
the
witness
did
have
lots
of
opportunity
to
observe
and
that
the
--
that
the
lineup
legal
or
illegal
was
not
the
major
factor,
then
we
will
allow
the
witness
to
identify
in
the
courtroom,
but
i
presume
not
show
if
some
question
is
raised,
not
allow
him
to
show
that
he
did
it
three
months
before
or
six
months
before
at
the
lineup.
and
when
you
considered,
that
this
is
not
the
problem
that
the
court
was
dealing
with
in
miranda,
that
is
rule
--
a
line
up
is
really
basically
designed
to
be
there.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
designed
to
be
there
because
a
line
up
as
conducted
is
done
so
that
witness
sees
several
people
rather
than
one,
it
doesn’t
have
any
of
the
potentialities
of
the
evil,
which
this
court
was
dealing
with
in
miranda
and
that
it
was
trying
to
avoid,
to
what
it
found
to
be
--
and
i
suppose
in
same
cases
actually
have
it
found
to
be
potentialities
is
nothing
that
a
line
up
is
secret,
the
witnesses
are
there,
people
are
there,
it’s
a
short
duration,
it
can’t
be
long,
its
basically
designed
to
be
a
fair
procedure,
maybe
in
this
case
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
yes
but
i
mean
it’s
certainly
easier
to
take
him
down
--
to
identify
this
man
in
this
cell.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
what
you
want
to
call
it,
it’s
a
fairer
method.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
it
was
a
fair
method?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don’t
know.
i
have
not
found
prosecutors
interested
in
convicting
innocent.
sometimes
they
get
mistaken
though
i’m
not
saying
that.
i
have
found
prosecutors
who
have
asked
ahead
of
time,
have
tried
to
be
assured
of
themselves,
they
sometimes
are
convinced
that
someone
and
maybe
mistakenly
convinced,
there
maybe
occasionally
people
who
are
put.
but
i
doubt
things
by
and
large,
people
are
seeing
united
states
attorneys
offices,
are
out
to
convict
a
man
at
any
court.
they
want
to
know
they
have
the
right
man,
yes
i
think
they
do.
