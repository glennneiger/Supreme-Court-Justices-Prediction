justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
suddenly
said
before
you
–
the
respondent
for
that
statement,
who
asked
the
question,
what
was
the
question
and
what
was
the
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
told
by
who?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
show
at
the
initial
--
whether
the
defendant
had
a
counter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
alone.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
alone,
even
if
seen
alone
like
in
the
court
room.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
identification
in
the
court
room
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
we’ll
he
is
seen
alone
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i’m
talking
about
whether
or
not
in
the
process
of
the
identification,
the
defendant
has
to
be
viewed
alone
or
with
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
some
other
place,
with
counsel
present?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
man
is
on
bail
and
fbi
agent
takes
a
witness
to
view
this
man
walking
down
the
street
or
having
a
cup
of
coffee
in
some
café?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
viewing
of
the
body
alone
is
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
your
sixth
amendment
claim
as
i
gather
it
is
really
a
mechanism
to
prevent
violation
under
the
fifth,
the
way
you
have
been
presenting
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
but
if
it
were
just
the
counsel,
the
right
to
counsel
you
are
talking
about
unrelated
to
the
fifth
amendment,
i
would
think
you
would
claim
that
viewing
the
body
in
the
absence
of
counsel
is
also
a
violation.
but
you
say
it
isn’t,
so
you
really
are
saying,
you
are
deprived
of
counsel
until
and
unless
he
asks
something
or
he
is
asked
to
reenact
a
crime
and
then
you
come
into
the
fifth
amendment
which
the
counsel
might
be
able
to
protect
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
do
you
say,
if
there
were
a
case
where,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
both
the
defendant
admitted
it
and
the
state
said
it
that
all
that
happened
at
the
lineup
was
a
viewing,
no
movements,
no
speaking,
nothing
except
a
viewing
and
counsel
was
not
present,
would
you
say
then
that
the
courtroom
identification
should
be
excluded?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
aren’t
relying
just
on
say
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
i
gather.
so
you
really
aren’t
--
so
you
are
saying
that
even
if
--
even
though
it’s
post
indictment
if
it’s
perfectly
clear
and
the
defendant
admits
that
nothing
happens
at
the
lineup
except
a
viewing.
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
so
you
would
say
even
though
that’s
perfectly
clear
that
nothing
happened
at
the
line
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
prosecutor
says
to
the
witness
there
is
the
fellow
who
did
it,
do
you
recognize
him,
would
that
violate
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
something
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
suddenly
said
before
you
–
the
respondent
for
that
statement,
who
asked
the
question,
what
was
the
question
and
what
was
the
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
told
by
who?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
show
at
the
initial
--
whether
the
defendant
had
a
counter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
alone.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
alone,
even
if
seen
alone
like
in
the
court
room.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
identification
in
the
court
room
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
we’ll
he
is
seen
alone
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i’m
talking
about
whether
or
not
in
the
process
of
the
identification,
the
defendant
has
to
be
viewed
alone
or
with
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
some
other
place,
with
counsel
present?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
man
is
on
bail
and
fbi
agent
takes
a
witness
to
view
this
man
walking
down
the
street
or
having
a
cup
of
coffee
in
some
café?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
viewing
of
the
body
alone
is
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
your
sixth
amendment
claim
as
i
gather
it
is
really
a
mechanism
to
prevent
violation
under
the
fifth,
the
way
you
have
been
presenting
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
but
if
it
were
just
the
counsel,
the
right
to
counsel
you
are
talking
about
unrelated
to
the
fifth
amendment,
i
would
think
you
would
claim
that
viewing
the
body
in
the
absence
of
counsel
is
also
a
violation.
but
you
say
it
isn’t,
so
you
really
are
saying,
you
are
deprived
of
counsel
until
and
unless
he
asks
something
or
he
is
asked
to
reenact
a
crime
and
then
you
come
into
the
fifth
amendment
which
the
counsel
might
be
able
to
protect
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
do
you
say,
if
there
were
a
case
where,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
both
the
defendant
admitted
it
and
the
state
said
it
that
all
that
happened
at

no

nothing

and

was
not

would
you
say
then
that
the
courtroom
identification
should
be
excluded?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
aren’t
relying
just
on
say
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
i
gather.
so
you
really
aren’t
--
so
you
are
saying
that
even
if
--
even
though
it’s
post
indictment
if
it’s
perfectly
clear
and
the
defendant
admits
that
nothing
happens
at
the
lineup
except
a
viewing.
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
so
you
would
say
even
though
that’s
perfectly
clear
that
nothing
happened
at
the
line
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
prosecutor
says
to
the
witness
there
is
the
fellow
who
did
it,
do
you
recognize
him,
would
that
violate
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
something
--
