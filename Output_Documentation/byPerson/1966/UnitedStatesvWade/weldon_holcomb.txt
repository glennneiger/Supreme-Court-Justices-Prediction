mr.
weldon
holcomb
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
to
start
with
i
would
like
to
correct
some
inverted
statements
by
my
opponent.
the
robbery
occurred
on
september
the
21,
1964.
the
indictment
was
march
23,
1965.
the
defendant
was
arrested
on
april
the
2nd,
1965
in
houston,
texas.
the
counsel
was
appointed
april
the
26th.
the
line
up
was
may
the
12th,
1965,
the
trial
on
its
merits
was
held
before
judge
shehi
(ph)
august
the
2nd,
through
the
4th,
1965.
summons
was
on
the
30th.
the
counsel
believes
that
the
sixth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fifth
amendment
tie
in
very
closely
in
this
matter.
counsel
had
already
been
appointed.
the
man
had
already
been
indicted
upon
the
statements
and
confessions
of
two
admitted
as
they
were
referred
to
at
large
in
brief
by
respondent.
he
was
arrested
upon
the
indictment.
there
after,
12
days
after
counsel
had
been
appointed
to
assist
him
in
the
protection
of
his
rights,
he
had
notified
the
court
that
he
did
not
have
a
counsel.
that
he
did
not
have
means
to
retain
a
counsel,
counsel
was
appointed.
thereafter
the
fbi
agent
made
the
arrangements
for
the
lineup,
the
witnesses
were
called
from
the
city
of
eustis,
a
small
town
northwest
of
tyler.
the
defendant
was
brought
from
his
cell
and
according
to
the
record,
he
was
observed
alone
or
with
mr.
albert
from
the
records.
in
the
printed
record
on
page
31,
we
find
further
contrary
to
as
i
understood
the
statement
of
ms.
rosenberg,
did
all
the
man
in
the
lineup
have
tape
on
their
faces?
yes,
where
they
all
dressed
alike
other
than
tape
on
their
faces?
no
i
don’t
think
so.
similar
statements
were
made
by
the
other
witness
mr.
gray.
it
is
counsel’s
position
in
this
particular
instance
that
the
taking
of
this
man
from
a
cell,
taking
him
to
the
court
room.
he
already
has
a
counsel,
having
him
observe
even
pleadingly
in
the
presence
of
the
instigator
of
the
lineup.
the
inquisitor
if
you
please
of
the
lineup,
the
entire
matter
was
being
handled
by
mr.
kenneth
albert
of
the
fbi,
he
made
all
the
arrangements,
he
had
talked
with
the
witnesses,
the
witnesses
knew
him.
according
to
one
witness
a
photograph
had
been
identified,
and
i
think
it’s
a
reasonable
statement
to
say
that
the
picture
was
probably
taken
after
the
arrest,
for
the
reason
that
if
a
competent
fbi
agent
had,
had
a
witness
testify
that
a
photograph
reflected
the
robber,
that
he
would
have
taken
some
action.
so
therefore
i
think
it’s
a
reasonable
assumption
from
the
circumstances
here,
that
this
picture
was
taken
after
the
arrest
of
the
defendant,
after
the
appointment
of
his
counsel
and
that
the
purpose
for
this
lineup
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
merely
identification,
if
it
was
as
counsel
stated
in
its
brief,
why
have
the
defendant
and
others
repeat
statements
as
admitted
by
counsel
for
the
government
in
the
fifth
circuit.
words
identical
or
words
very
similar
to
that
used
by
the
robber,
such
as
fill
up
the
bag,
they
could
just
as
easily
have
him
read
a
few
portions
of
the
constitution
or
a
novel
or
a
newspaper.
but
he
was
required
to
reenact
a
portion
of
the
crime
in
the
absence
of
his
attorney.
so
what
do
we
have
here
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court?
we
do
not
have
the
situation
as
we
have
is
in
this
schmerber
case,
in
the
schmerber
case
by
justice
brennan,
we
found
a
blood
test
taken
under
hospital
conditions
by
someone
of
no
interest
in
the
case,
a
disinterested
person.
the
lawyer
was
there
and
even
though
i
disagree
with
result,
as
i
understand
the
statements
by
justice
brennan
that
because
of
these
safe
guards
there
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
man
were
not
violated,
but
we
do
not
have
that
here.
you
may
take
a
blood
test,
examine
it
today
and
the
result
will
be
this,
examine
it
next
week
and
the
blood
will
remain
the
same,
they
have
all
types
of
things
that
they
put
in
the
blood
to
keep
in
that
condition.
but
here
we
have
a
man
required
to
make
statements,
similar
to
those
used
in
the
robbery.
it
goes
into
the
ears,
the
eyes
perceive,
eye
witness
do
that
six
months
after
the
robbery
they
have
seen
this
man
with
this
man
whom
they
known
to
be
a
federal
agent,
alone
(inaudible)
he
resembles
him
or
it
was
him.
then
this
time
six
months
after
which
he
comes
in,
he
has
tape
placed
upon
his
face
and
according
to
the
record
he
was
not
dressed
like
the
others.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
according
to
the
record
your
honor
one
witness
miss
--
the
lady
testified
that
she
had
identified
a
photograph
of
the
defendant.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
there
is
no
date
in
the
record
your
honor
as
to
when
it
occurred,
in
my
examination
of
her,
i
was
trying
to
show
whether
or
not
she
had
seen
a
picture
or
anything
of
that
nature
during
the
investigation
and
as
i
understand
the
record
mr.
albert
had
shown
every
picture
he
does
not
state
he
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
believe
that
it
would
be
a
fair
inference
from
it
mr.
justice
brennan
based
upon
the
surrounding
facts
of
the
case,
that
had
fbi
agent
albert
been
told
by
the
witness
that
this
is
the
man
and
i
identify
him,
i
think
it’s
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
competent
federal
agent
would
have
issued
a
warrant
and
attempted
to
arrest
the
man
and
such
was
not
done.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
first
of
all
your
honor
if
i
had
the
opportunity
i
would
have
done
my
utmost
as
counsel
to
prevent
my
client
from
being
seen
alone
or
under
any
circumstances
which
might
tend
to
point
the
finger
of
guilt
toward
him,
such
has
being
observed
alone.
secondly,
i
would
have
advised
my
client
to
refrain
from
making
any
statements
of
any
kind
whatsoever
at
the
line
up.
especially
those
that
would
be
incriminatory
or
a
reenactment
of
a
portion
of
the
crime.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
yes
sir.
i
believe
i
conceded
that
in
my
brief
your
honor
and
that
i
believe
that
the
mere
exhibition
of
the
body
as
such
and
the
physical
characteristics
of
his
arms,
legs
or
so
forth
of
that
nature
will
not
cause
to
be
a
constitution
of
violation.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
sir?
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
will
not
go
that
far
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
i
think
you
are
referring
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
not,
not
in
an
open
court
during
a
trial
but
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
line
up
bringing
him
by
himself.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
in
open
court,
i
couldn’t
conceive
a
no
violation
of
any
kind
whatsoever
there
your
honor
in
an
open
court.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
with
counsel
your
honor
i
think
that
his
rights
could
be
protected,
he
will
be
not
shown
possibly
as
a
prisoner
by
himself
in
the
custody
of
--
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
justice
white
is
the
fact
that
this
man
mr.
albert,
the
fbi
agent
has
been
handling
it
all
the
way
through,
he
was
a
man
that
made
all
of
the
arrangements.
he
brought
the
witnesses
back
and
as
i
understand
that
record
the
defendant
was
alone
with
mr.
albert.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
see
no
violation
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
see
no
constitutional
violation
on
certain
facts
that
he
states
–
mr.
weldon
holcomb
alone,
your
honor?
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
believe
that,
that
would
be
a
possible
constitutional
violation.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
under
the
circumstances,
i
believe
that
he
would
be
violating
his
due
process.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
it
could
involve
counsel,
but
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
not
the
incrimination.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
that
standing
alone
i
would
say
would
not
be
a
violation.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
would
say
that,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
in
regard
to
counsel
and
self
incrimination
on
the
fifth
amendment
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
believe
that
it’s
an
attempt
to
be
as
fair
as
possible
justice
white,
but
in
this
instance,
under
these
circumstances,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
main
purpose
was
simply
for
identification,
because
the
man
had
already
been
identified,
he
was
under
indictment,
two
alleged
accomplices
had
given
statements
that
this
man
was
the
man
and
he
was
just
awaiting
trial
and
so
they
bring
the
people
over
and
put
him
in
there,
but
they
didn’t
put
a
straw
hat
on
him
and
they
didn’t
see
that
he
was
dressed
similar
to
the
robber
in
circumstances
that
count
and
i
still
get
back
to
the
individual
officer
who
is
running
the
show,
that
his
association
would
and
i
feel
that
that
any
normal
human
being
who
is
attempting
to
maintain
a
position.
i
prosecuted
for
ten
years
myself
your
honor.
i
feel
like
when
the
man
was
indicted,
he
felt
now
this
is
the
man.
but
he
has
been
indicted
and
either
consciously
or
unconsciously
he
was
attempting
to
build
the
government’s
case
and
close
the
gate,
but
all
the
change
around
him
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
nothing
at
all
your
honor,
except
the
fact
that
you
are
taking
witnesses
there
--
putting
them
with
the
authority
exhibited
by
this
officer,
taking
it
into
the
courtroom,
his
lawyer
wasn’t
there,
a
judge
wasn’t
there,
he
was
held
in
a
courtroom
under
circumstances
these
two
lay
witnesses
sitting
as
spectators
in
the
courtroom
and
the
courtroom
gives
the
(inaudible)
to
what
the
officer
is
doing
and
just
adds
to
it
on
the
circumstances
that
the
man
doesn’t
have
his
lawyer
there
and
as
the
powell
case
said
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel,
whatever
he
could
do.
i
don’t
now
what
you
could
do
for
him,
but
at
least
you
are
there
and
you’ll
do
your
best
to
protect
the
rights
of
that
individual.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
as
i
have
conceded
that
the
mere
viewing
of
the
body
under
proper
circumstances
would
not
be
a
violation,
in
my
opinion
of
the
man’s
constitution
rights.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
your
honor,
it’s
directly
from
the
record
here
that
the
witness
said
they
were
not
all
dressed
alike.
in
the
smith
county
jail,
if
the
court
will
allow,
i
will
tell
you
what
their
policy
is
in
smith
county
jail,
justice
stewart.
in
the
smith
county
jail
the
county
prisoners
wear
white
uniforms.
the
federal
prisoners
have
there
own
attire
whatever
it
may
be.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
none.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir.
getting
to
the
portion
there
where
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
fifth
circuit
has
ruled
in
regard
to
the
reenactment
of
the
portion
of
the
crime.
it
is
our
position
that
in
the
event
this
court
were
to
see
fit
to
say
that
the
mere
asking
of
a
man’s
name
or
the
mere
asking
of
non-inculpatory
statements
or
those
not
involving
the
reenactment
of
the
crime
were
constitutional
and
will
not
be
a
violation
of
the
man’s
right,
then
we
say
that
this
case
would
be
clearly
distinguishable
from
such
a
case,
because
the
defendant
was
required
to
utter
words,
reenact
a
portion
of
the
crime
and
therefore
the
self
incrimination
was
violated
and
also
the
sixth
amendment
because
his
counsel
was
not
witness.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
now
rest
are
wondering
that
justice
stuart,
this
man
was
already
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
as
i
understand
correct.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
but
not
necessarily
so
the
distinction
that
i
really
draw
your
honor
is
the
fact
that
this
man
had
a
lawyer,
and
these
things
occurred.
now
if
they
were
still
investigating
this
matter
like
there
had
just
been
a
robbery
and
they
were
picking
up
suspect
to
just
take
a
look
at
him
and
see
if
they
get
him
identified
that’s
one
thing,
but
where
six
months
has
transpired
and
a
man’s
indicted.
he
appears
for
arraignment
before
the
federal
judge
and
the
judge
appoints
him
a
lawyer
and
then
these
things
occur,
i
think
it’s
highly
probable.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
and
ask
questions
or
just
put
in
a
plain
line
up?
mr.
weldon
holcomb
just
a
plain
line
up,
i
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
constitution
violation
under
i
believe
justice
holmes
and
the
whole
case.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
hate
to
go
that
far
your
honor,
but
if
the
viewing
of
the
body
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
that’s
the
position
that
i
desire
to
maintain.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
well
based
upon
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
past,
i
think,
that
that
distinction
is
there
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.[laughter]
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
but
if
you
do
i
think
it
should
be
--
this
court
should
tell
the
investigating
authority
whether
it
be
the
state
or
the
federal
that
this
will
not
be
tolerated.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
he
can
be
tried,
he
could
not
be
tried
effectively
in
the
state
of
texas,
in
the
state
courts
because
it
requires
corroboration,
but
under
the
federal
rules
and
law,
as
i
understand
it,
the
testimony
of
these
two
admitted
robbers,
who
denied
they
know
anything
for
six
months
and
then
came
around
and
told
the
federal
authorities,
yes
this
man
did
it,
that
judge
shehi
(ph)
could
put
him
to
trial,
have
a
jury
and
if
the
jury
saw
fit
they
could
convict
him
one
the
uncorroborated
testimony
of
the
two
accomplices
alone.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
could
not
testify
as
to
the
identification,
they
could
testify
as
to
all
of
the
actions
of
the
robbery
that
occurred
at
the
time
the
robbery
occurred,
but
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
identify
the
defendant
because
of
the
theory
applied
for
the
fifth
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
that
it
might
be
under
the
(inaudible)
doctrine
and
so
forth
in
the
court
that
there
is
question
there
as
to
whether
or
not,
who
can
reasonably
say
that
this
line
up
did
not
occur
or
could
not
occur
(inaudible)
--
it’s
not
like
the
blood
test
or
the
footprint,
but
defense
counsel
can
examine
those
at
leisure,
he
could
have
someone
else
examine
the
footprint
or
someone
else
examine
the
blood
test.
but
who
can
examine
the
workings
of
the
human
man
and
the
memory,
whenever
it’s
passed,
in
other
words
the
government’s
counsel
says
(inaudible)
that
if
i
had
been
there,
i’d
go
talk
to
the
government’s
witnesses
and
so
forth,
examine
their
minds,
but
isn’t
it
a
basic
human
feeling
to
sustain
what
you
said
that
i
believe,
i
am
right,
i
am
going
to
stay
there
and
try
to
sustain
your
position.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
that’s
correct.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
the
identification
as
arrived
at
under
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
says
that
who
can
reasonably
say
justice
black
that
the
identification
that
the
action
of
the
witnesses
in
identifying
this
man
was
not
colored
by
the
activities
of
the
fbi
agent,
the
observation
of
the
person
alone
or
the
asking
of
this
individual
to
reenact
a
portion
of
the
crime.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
as
such
your
honor
it
was
not
brought
up
by
them
that
there
had
been
a
line
up,
but
they
used
the
eyewitness
testimony
that
the
two
witnesses
gray
and
chamber
said
this
is
man,
this
is
the
man
that
robbed
me
and
it’s
my
contention
and
which
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
your
honor
that
who
can
reasonably
say
that
the
identification,
the
positive
identification
of
my
client,
mr.
wade
was
not
colored
in
any
manner
by
the
improper
activity
of
the
lineup
of
requiring
him
to
reenact
a
portion
of
the
crime
six
months
after
the
robbery.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir
i
was
sitting
there,
if
i
recall
correctly
trying
to
keep
my
business
straight
your
honor
and
my
client
leaned
across
the
table
behind
me
and
mentioned
something
about
the
lineup
and
i
proceeded
from
there,
i
think
and
my
questioning
reflected
that
i
was
not
appraised
of
it
justice
harlan.
if
i
had
been
i
would
very
probably
have
asked
for
some
type
of
a
hearing
or
filed
some
type
of
a
motion
to
find
out
what
happened.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
especially
after
an
indictment
justice
fortas,
it’s
been
common
as
a
state
prosecutor
we
utilize
it
all
the
time.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
before
indictment
if
we
were
trying
to
find
out
who
robbed
the
bank
or
who
burglarized
the
place
or
any
type
involving
a
person.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
sir?
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
not
unless
it
called
for
by
improper
examination
of
one
of
our
witnesses
by
the
undecided.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
to
my
knowledge
i
do
not
recall
having
participated
in
one
or
authorized
in
one
as
district
attorney
after
indictment.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
justice
black,
i
don’t
see
how
we
can
separate
it,
who
can
say
--
i
believe
that
all
of
us
are
part
of
everything
we
have
been
exposed
to.
so
if
something
improper
has
been
exposed
to
us,
that
no
matter
how
much
that
i
feel
that
even
though
we
might
say,
well
we
are
just
laid
aside
and
we
cannot
where
this
lineup
occurred
six
months,
approximately
six
months
after
the
robbery.
and
then
these
other
things,
with
this
man
being
observed
in
the
hall
or
in
any
room,
alone
or
with
this
man,
mr.
albert
whom
they
knew
and
which
i
ask
in
the
interrogation
of
the
witnesses,
they
knew
mr.
albert
was
the
fbi
agent,
they
knew
he
was
man
who
called
them
down
there,
they
knew
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
called,
there
is
the
man
with
mr.
albert,
there
is
the
man
alone
and
other
people
come
down
who
can
reasonably
say
that
the
workings
of
the
human
mind
for
identification
was
not
in
anyways
affected
by
this
activity.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
your
honor
it
could
justice
harlan.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
if
the
lineup
is
held
without
any
adornments
and
without
any
viewing
of
the
body
so
to
speak,
i
would
say
that
would
be
merely
to
the
weight
of
it
justice
harlan.
but
if
they
go
further
and
ask
for
a
reenactment
of
a
portion
of
the
crime
or
such
questions
did
you
rob
this
bank?
yes
sir,
they
make
him
speak
–
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
hate
to
concede
that
justice
harlan
but
i
believe
that
it
in
all
fairness
that
i
should,
that
if
the
man
is
asked
his
name,
that
it’s
hard
to
draw
the
line,
justice
harlan,
i
will
say
that
if
you
ask
him
about
the
crime
or
reenact
a
portion
of
it
and
so
forth
in
my
opinion
without
a
doubt
is
a
violation.
but
the
viewing
of
the
body
and
how
much
further
this
court
would
desire
to
go
i’m
not
in
position
to
say
but
i
would
say
that,
just
getting
on
the
line,
yes.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
my
basic
position
is
the
sixth
amendment
claim
of
deprivation
of
counsel
and
the
fifth
amendment
is
just
in
conjunction
with
it.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
but
in
the
event,
you
do
have
this
type
of
activity
that
if
the
government
is
not
prohibited
from
using
this
tainted
evidence,
then
there
is
no
punishment
for
the
government
or
any
other
authority.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
no
sir.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
i
rest
basically
on
my
sixth
amendment
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
as
an
attorney
anything
that
i
am
charged
by
the
law
to
prevent
from
them
occurring
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir
and
i
find
it
very
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
and
no
your
honor
and
may
i
say
this,
it’s
like
i
said
a
while
ago
on
the
court
opinion
on
justice
holmes
that’s
what
the
court
have
ruled
not
that
i
necessarily
agree
with,
but
that’s
what
the
court
has
held,
but
i
feel
like
it,
if
you
deprive
the
man
of
his
attorney,
then
everything
else
is
unreal.
so
if
the
man’s
got
a
lawyer,
his
lawyer
should
be
entitled
to
be
with
him.
it
is
one
case
for
this
court
to
deprive
a
man
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
on
that
alone
i’d
say
no
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
you
put
post
indictment
when
you
put
the
indictment
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes,
post
indictment
i
say
yes,
that
if
he
is
entitled
to
have
his
lawyer,
have
him
there,
but
now
as
i
replied
to
justice
fortas,
when
we
were
investigating
cases
that’s
one
thing.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
if
they
violate
the
man’s
constitutional
rights
justice
black
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
believe
my
statement
justice
stewart
i
believe
it
was
sir
that
these
witnesses
could
testify
to
that
but
not
to
the
identification,
that
the
only
thing
that
would
be
barred
was
their
eye
witness
identification
based
upon
the
lineup
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
not
--
as
i
understand
not
in
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
it’s
not
my
position
my
position
is,
my
position
your
honor
is
that
the
witness
can
testify
to
anything
except
the
identification
that
he
made
there,
in
other
words,
he
testified
at
the
robbery,
he
testified
all
the
facts
that
occurred
and
so
forth
but
he
cannot
testify
that
this
is
a
man
that
did
it,
if
the
rights
of
the
man
were
violated
at
the
lineup.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
that’s
correct
sir.
the
two
accomplices
could.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
it
could
be
sir.
if
the
prosecutor
said,
if
there
is
a
benefit
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
it’s
open
court
your
honor
and
everyone
is
there
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes,
his
counsel
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
if
counsel
is
with
his
client
there
in
open
court
and
so
forth
your
honor
and
nothing
else
was
known,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
no
violation.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
certainly
that
has
been
done,
i
think
that
would
be
a
violation
justice.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
as
i
say
we
all
sustain
position,
i
feel
that
would
be
improper
thank
you.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
to
start
with
i
would
like
to
correct
some
inverted
statements
by
my
opponent.
the
robbery
occurred
on
september
the
21,
1964.
the
indictment
was
march
23,
1965.
the
defendant
was
arrested
on
april
the
2nd,
1965
in
houston,
texas.
the
counsel
was
appointed
april
the
26th.
the
line
up
was
may
the
12th,
1965,
the
trial
on
its
merits
was
held
before
judge
shehi
(ph)
august
the
2nd,
through
the
4th,
1965.
summons
was
on
the
30th.
the
counsel
believes
that
the
sixth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fifth
amendment
tie
in
very
closely
in
this
matter.
counsel
had
already
been
appointed.
the
man
had
already
been
indicted
upon
the
statements
and
confessions
of
two
admitted
as
they
were
referred
to
at
large
in
brief
by
respondent.
he
was
arrested
upon
the
indictment.
there
after,
12
days
after
counsel
had
been
appointed
to
assist
him
in
the
protection
of
his
rights,
he
had
notified
the
court
that
he
did
not
have
a
counsel.
that
he
did
not
have
means
to
retain
a
counsel,
counsel
was
appointed.
thereafter
the
fbi
agent
made
the
arrangements
for
the
lineup,
the
witnesses
were
called
from
the
city
of
eustis,
a
small
town
northwest
of
tyler.
the
defendant
was
brought
from
his
cell
and
according
to
the
record,
he
was
observed
alone
or
with
mr.
albert
from
the
records.
in
the
printed
record
on
page
31,
we
find
further
contrary
to
as
i
understood
the
statement
of
ms.
rosenberg,
did
all
the
man
in
the
lineup
have
tape
on
their
faces?
yes,
where
they
all
dressed
alike
other
than
tape
on
their
faces?
no
i
don’t
think
so.
similar
statements
were
made
by
the
other
witness
mr.
gray.
it
is
counsel’s
position
in
this
particular
instance
that
the
taking
of
this
man
from
a
cell,
taking
him
to
the
court
room.
he
already
has
a
counsel,
having
him
observe
even
pleadingly
in
the
presence
of
the
instigator
of
the
lineup.
the
inquisitor
if
you
please
of
the
lineup,
the
entire
matter
was
being
handled
by
mr.
kenneth
albert
of
the
fbi,
he
made
all
the
arrangements,
he
had
talked
with
the
witnesses,
the
witnesses
knew
him.
according
to
one
witness
a
photograph
had
been
identified,
and
i
think
it’s
a
reasonable
statement
to
say
that
the
picture
was
probably
taken
after
the
arrest,
for
the
reason
that
if
a
competent
fbi
agent
had,
had
a
witness
testify
that
a
photograph
reflected
the
robber,
that
he
would
have
taken
some
action.
so
therefore
i
think
it’s
a
reasonable
assumption
from
the
circumstances
here,
that
this
picture
was
taken
after
the
arrest
of
the
defendant,
after
the
appointment
of
his
counsel
and
that
the
purpose
for
this
lineup
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
merely
identification,
if
it
was
as
counsel
stated
in
its
brief,
why
have
the
defendant
and
others
repeat
statements
as
admitted
by
counsel
for
the
government
in
the
fifth
circuit.
words
identical
or
words
very
similar
to
that
used
by
the
robber,
such
as
fill
up
the
bag,
they
could
just
as
easily
have
him
read
a
few
portions
of
the
constitution
or
a
novel
or
a
newspaper.
but
he
was
required
to
reenact
a
portion
of
the
crime
in
the
absence
of
his
attorney.
so
what
do
we
have
here
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court?
we
do
not
have
the
situation
as
we
have
is
in
this
schmerber
case,
in
the
schmerber
case
by
justice
brennan,
we
found
a
blood
test
taken
under
hospital
conditions
by
someone
of
no
interest
in
the
case,
a
disinterested
person.
the
lawyer
was
there
and
even
though
i
disagree
with
result,
as
i
understand
the
statements
by
justice
brennan
that
because
of
these
safe
guards
there
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
man
were
not
violated,
but
we
do
not
have
that
here.
you
may
take
a
blood
test,
examine
it
today
and
the
result
will
be
this,
examine
it
next
week
and
the
blood
will
remain
the
same,
they
have
all
types
of
things
that
they
put
in
the
blood
to
keep
in
that
condition.
but
here
we
have
a
man
required
to
make
statements,
similar
to
those
used
in
the
robbery.
it
goes
into
the
ears,
the
eyes
perceive,
eye
witness
do
that
six
months
after
the
robbery
they
have
seen
this
man
with
this
man
whom
they
known
to
be
a
federal
agent,
alone
(inaudible)
he
resembles
him
or
it
was
him.
then
this
time
six
months
after
which
he
comes
in,
he
has
tape
placed
upon
his
face
and
according
to
the
record
he
was
not
dressed
like
the
others.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
according
to
the
record
your
honor
one
witness
miss
--
the
lady
testified
that
she
had
identified
a
photograph
of
the
defendant.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
there
is
no
date
in
the
record
your
honor
as
to
when
it
occurred,
in
my
examination
of
her,
i
was
trying
to
show
whether
or
not
she
had
seen
a
picture
or
anything
of
that
nature
during
the
investigation
and
as
i
understand
the
record
mr.
albert
had
shown
every
picture
he
does
not
state
he
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
believe
that
it
would
be
a
fair
inference
from
it
mr.
justice
brennan
based
upon
the
surrounding
facts
of
the
case,
that
had
fbi
agent
albert
been
told
by
the
witness
that
this
is
the
man
and
i
identify
him,
i
think
it’s
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
competent
federal
agent
would
have
issued
a
warrant
and
attempted
to
arrest
the
man
and
such
was
not
done.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
first
of
all
your
honor
if
i
had
the
opportunity
i
would
have
done
my
utmost
as
counsel
to
prevent
my
client
from
being
seen
alone
or
under
any
circumstances
which
might
tend
to
point
the
finger
of
guilt
toward
him,
such
has
being
observed
alone.
secondly,
i
would
have
advised
my
client
to
refrain
from
making
any
statements
of
any
kind
whatsoever
at
the
line
up.
especially
those
that
would
be
incriminatory
or
a
reenactment
of
a
portion
of
the
crime.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
yes
sir.
i
believe
i
conceded
that
in
my
brief
your
honor
and
that
i
believe
that
the
mere
exhibition
of
the
body
as
such
and
the
physical
characteristics
of
his
arms,
legs
or
so
forth
of
that
nature
will
not
cause
to
be
a
constitution
of
violation.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
sir?
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
will
not
go
that
far
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
i
think
you
are
referring
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
not,
not
in
an
open
court
during
a
trial
but
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
line
up
bringing
him
by
himself.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
in
open
court,
i
couldn’t
conceive
a
no
violation
of
any
kind
whatsoever
there
your
honor
in
an
open
court.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
with
counsel
your
honor
i
think
that
his
rights
could
be
protected,
he
will
be
not
shown
possibly
as
a
prisoner
by
himself
in
the
custody
of
--
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
justice
white
is
the
fact
that
this
man
mr.
albert,
the
fbi
agent
has
been
handling
it
all
the
way
through,
he
was
a
man
that
made
all
of
the
arrangements.
he
brought
the
witnesses
back
and
as
i
understand
that
record
the
defendant
was
alone
with
mr.
albert.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
see
no
violation
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
see
no
constitutional
violation
on
certain
facts
that
he
states
–
mr.
weldon
holcomb
alone,
your
honor?
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
believe
that,
that
would
be
a
possible
constitutional
violation.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
under
the
circumstances,
i
believe
that
he
would
be
violating
his
due
process.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
it
could
involve
counsel,
but
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
not
the
incrimination.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
that
standing
alone
i
would
say
would
not
be
a
violation.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
would
say
that,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
in
regard
to
counsel
and
self
incrimination
on
the
fifth
amendment
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
believe
that
it’s
an
attempt
to
be
as
fair
as
possible
justice
white,
but
in
this
instance,
under
these
circumstances,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
main
purpose
was
simply
for
identification,
because
the
man
had
already
been
identified,
he
was
under
indictment,
two
alleged
accomplices
had
given
statements
that
this
man
was
the
man
and
he
was
just
awaiting
trial
and
so
they
bring
the
people
over
and
put
him
in
there,
but
they
didn’t
put
a
straw
hat
on
him
and
they
didn’t
see
that
he
was
dressed
similar
to
the
robber
in
circumstances
that
count
and
i
still
get
back
to
the
individual
officer
who
is
running
the
show,
that
his
association
would
and
i
feel
that
that
any
normal
human
being
who
is
attempting
to
maintain
a
position.
i
prosecuted
for
ten
years
myself
your
honor.
i
feel
like
when
the
man
was
indicted,
he
felt
now
this
is
the
man.
but
he
has
been
indicted
and
either
consciously
or
unconsciously
he
was
attempting
to
build
the
government’s
case
and
close
the
gate,
but
all
the
change
around
him
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
nothing
at
all
your
honor,
except
the
fact
that
you
are
taking
witnesses
there
--
putting
them
with
the
authority
exhibited
by
this
officer,
taking
it
into
the
courtroom,
his
lawyer
wasn’t
there,
a
judge
wasn’t
there,
he
was
held
in
a
courtroom
under
circumstances
these
two
lay
witnesses
sitting
as
spectators
in
the
courtroom
and
the
courtroom
gives
the
(inaudible)
to
what
the
officer
is
doing
and
just
adds
to
it
on
the
circumstances
that
the
man
doesn’t
have
his
lawyer
there
and
as
the
powell
case
said
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel,
whatever
he
could
do.
i
don’t
now
what
you
could
do
for
him,
but
at
least
you
are
there
and
you’ll
do
your
best
to
protect
the
rights
of
that
individual.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
as
i
have
conceded
that
the
mere
viewing
of
the
body
under
proper
circumstances
would
not
be
a
violation,
in
my
opinion
of
the
man’s
constitution
rights.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
your
honor,
it’s
directly
from
the
record
here
that
the
witness
said
they
were
not
all
dressed
alike.
in
the
smith
county
jail,
if
the
court
will
allow,
i
will
tell
you
what
their
policy
is
in
smith
county
jail,
justice
stewart.
in
the
smith
county
jail
the
county
prisoners
wear
white
uniforms.
the
federal
prisoners
have
there
own
attire
whatever
it
may
be.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
none.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir.
getting
to
the
portion
there
where
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
fifth
circuit
has
ruled
in
regard
to
the
reenactment
of
the
portion
of
the
crime.
it
is
our
position
that
in
the
event
this
court
were
to
see
fit
to
say
that
the
mere
asking
of
a
man’s
name
or
the
mere
asking
of
non-inculpatory
statements
or
those
not
involving
the
reenactment
of
the
crime
were
constitutional
and
will
not
be
a
violation
of
the
man’s
right,
then
we
say
that
this
case
would
be
clearly
distinguishable
from
such
a
case,
because
the
defendant
was
required
to
utter
words,
reenact
a
portion
of
the
crime
and
therefore
the
self
incrimination
was
violated
and
also
the
sixth
amendment
because
his
counsel
was
not
witness.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
now
rest
are
wondering
that
justice
stuart,
this
man
was
already
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
as
i
understand
correct.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
but
not
necessarily
so
the
distinction
that
i
really
draw
your
honor
is
the
fact
that
this
man
had
a
lawyer,
and
these
things
occurred.
now
if
they
were
still
investigating
this
matter
like
there
had
just
been
a
robbery
and
they
were
picking
up
suspect
to
just
take
a
look
at
him
and
see
if
they
get
him
identified
that’s
one
thing,
but
where
six
months
has
transpired
and
a
man’s
indicted.
he
appears
for
arraignment
before
the
federal
judge
and
the
judge
appoints
him
a
lawyer
and
then
these
things
occur,
i
think
it’s
highly
probable.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
and
ask
questions
or
just
put
in
a
plain
line
up?
mr.
weldon
holcomb
just
a
plain
line
up,
i
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
constitution
violation
under
i
believe
justice
holmes
and
the
whole
case.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
hate
to
go
that
far
your
honor,
but
if
the
viewing
of
the
body
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
that’s
the
position
that
i
desire
to
maintain.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
well
based
upon
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
past,
i
think,
that
that
distinction
is
there
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.[laughter]
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
but
if
you
do
i
think
it
should
be
--
this
court
should
tell
the
investigating
authority
whether
it
be
the
state
or
the
federal
that
this
will
not
be
tolerated.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
he
can
be
tried,
he
could
not
be
tried
effectively
in
the
state
of
texas,
in
the
state
courts
because
it
requires
corroboration,
but
under
the
federal
rules
and
law,
as
i
understand
it,
the
testimony
of
these
two
admitted
robbers,
who
denied
they
know
anything
for
six
months
and
then
came
around
and
told
the
federal
authorities,
yes
this
man
did
it,
that
judge
shehi
(ph)
could
put
him
to
trial,
have
a
jury
and
if
the
jury
saw
fit
they
could
convict
him
one
the
uncorroborated
testimony
of
the
two
accomplices
alone.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
could
not
testify
as
to
the
identification,
they
could
testify
as
to
all
of
the
actions
of
the
robbery
that
occurred
at
the
time
the
robbery
occurred,
but
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
identify
the
defendant
because
of
the
theory
applied
for
the
fifth
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
that
it
might
be
under
the
(inaudible)
doctrine
and
so
forth
in
the
court
that
there
is
question
there
as
to
whether
or
not,
who
can
reasonably
say
that
this
line
up
did
not
occur
or
could
not
occur
(inaudible)
--
it’s
not
like
the
blood
test
or
the
footprint,
but
defense
counsel
can
examine
those
at
leisure,
he
could
have
someone
else
examine
the
footprint
or
someone
else
examine
the
blood
test.
but
who
can
examine
the
workings
of
the
human
man
and
the
memory,
whenever
it’s
passed,
in
other
words
the
government’s
counsel
says
(inaudible)
that
if
i
had
been
there,
i’d
go
talk
to
the
government’s
witnesses
and
so
forth,
examine
their
minds,
but
isn’t
it
a
basic
human
feeling
to
sustain
what
you
said
that
i
believe,
i
am
right,
i
am
going
to
stay
there
and
try
to
sustain
your
position.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
that’s
correct.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
the
identification
as
arrived
at
under
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
says
that
who
can
reasonably
say
justice
black
that
the
identification
that
the
action
of
the
witnesses
in
identifying
this
man
was
not
colored
by
the
activities
of
the
fbi
agent,
the
observation
of
the
person
alone
or
the
asking
of
this
individual
to
reenact
a
portion
of
the
crime.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
as
such
your
honor
it
was
not
brought
up
by
them
that
there
had
been
a
line
up,
but
they
used
the
eyewitness
testimony
that
the
two
witnesses
gray
and
chamber
said
this
is
man,
this
is
the
man
that
robbed
me
and
it’s
my
contention
and
which
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
your
honor
that
who
can
reasonably
say
that
the
identification,
the
positive
identification
of
my
client,
mr.
wade
was
not
colored
in
any
manner
by
the
improper
activity
of
the
lineup
of
requiring
him
to
reenact
a
portion
of
the
crime
six
months
after
the
robbery.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir
i
was
sitting
there,
if
i
recall
correctly
trying
to
keep
my
business
straight
your
honor
and
my
client
leaned
across
the
table
behind
me
and
mentioned
something
about
the
lineup
and
i
proceeded
from
there,
i
think
and
my
questioning
reflected
that
i
was
not
appraised
of
it
justice
harlan.
if
i
had
been
i
would
very
probably
have
asked
for
some
type
of
a
hearing
or
filed
some
type
of
a
motion
to
find
out
what
happened.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
especially
after
an
indictment
justice
fortas,
it’s
been
common
as
a
state
prosecutor
we
utilize
it
all
the
time.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
before
indictment
if
we
were
trying
to
find
out
who
robbed
the
bank
or
who
burglarized
the
place
or
any
type
involving
a
person.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
sir?
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
not
unless
it
called
for
by
improper
examination
of
one
of
our
witnesses
by
the
undecided.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
to
my
knowledge
i
do
not
recall
having
participated
in
one
or
authorized
in
one
as
district
attorney
after
indictment.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
justice
black,
i
don’t
see
how
we
can
separate
it,
who
can
say
--
i
believe
that
all
of
us
are
part
of
everything
we
have
been
exposed
to.
so
if
something
improper
has
been
exposed
to
us,
that
no
matter
how
much
that
i
feel
that
even
though
we
might
say,
well
we
are
just
laid
aside
and
we
cannot
where
this
lineup
occurred
six
months,
approximately
six
months
after
the
robbery.
and
then
these
other
things,
with
this
man
being
observed
in
the
hall
or
in
any
room,
alone
or
with
this
man,
mr.
albert
whom
they
knew
and
which
i
ask
in
the
interrogation
of
the
witnesses,
they
knew
mr.
albert
was
the
fbi
agent,
they
knew
he
was
man
who
called
them
down
there,
they
knew
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
called,
there
is
the
man
with
mr.
albert,
there
is
the
man
alone
and
other
people
come
down
who
can
reasonably
say
that
the
workings
of
the
human
mind
for
identification
was
not
in
anyways
affected
by
this
activity.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
your
honor
it
could
justice
harlan.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
if
the
lineup
is
held
without
any
adornments
and
without
any
viewing
of
the
body
so
to
speak,
i
would
say
that
would
be
merely
to
the
weight
of
it
justice
harlan.
but
if
they
go
further
and
ask
for
a
reenactment
of
a
portion
of
the
crime
or
such
questions
did
you
rob
this
bank?
yes
sir,
they
make
him
speak
–
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
hate
to
concede
that
justice
harlan
but
i
believe
that
it
in
all
fairness
that
i
should,
that
if
the
man
is
asked
his
name,
that
it’s
hard
to
draw
the
line,
justice
harlan,
i
will
say
that
if
you
ask
him
about
the
crime
or
reenact
a
portion
of
it
and
so
forth
in
my
opinion
without
a
doubt
is
a
violation.
but
the
viewing
of
the
body
and
how
much
further
this
court
would
desire
to
go
i’m
not
in
position
to
say
but
i
would
say
that,
just
getting
on
the
line,
yes.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
my
basic
position
is
the
sixth
amendment
claim
of
deprivation
of
counsel
and
the
fifth
amendment
is
just
in
conjunction
with
it.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
but
in
the
event,
you
do
have
this
type
of
activity
that
if
the
government
is
not
prohibited
from
using
this
tainted
evidence,
then
there
is
no
punishment
for
the
government
or
any
other
authority.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
no
sir.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
i
rest
basically
on
my
sixth
amendment
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
as
an
attorney
anything
that
i
am
charged
by
the
law
to
prevent
from
them
occurring
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir
and
i
find
it
very
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
and
no
your
honor
and
may
i
say
this,
it’s
like
i
said
a
while
ago
on
the
court
opinion
on
justice
holmes
that’s
what
the
court
have
ruled
not
that
i
necessarily
agree
with,
but
that’s
what
the
court
has
held,
but
i
feel
like
it,
if
you
deprive
the
man
of
his
attorney,
then
everything
else
is
unreal.
so
if
the
man’s
got
a
lawyer,
his
lawyer
should
be
entitled
to
be
with
him.
it
is
one
case
for
this
court
to
deprive
a
man
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
on
that
alone
i’d
say
no
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir,
you
put
post
indictment
when
you
put
the
indictment
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes,
post
indictment
i
say
yes,
that
if
he
is
entitled
to
have
his
lawyer,
have
him
there,
but
now
as
i
replied
to
justice
fortas,
when
we
were
investigating
cases
that’s
one
thing.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
if
they
violate
the
man’s
constitutional
rights
justice
black
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
i
believe
my
statement
justice
stewart
i
believe
it
was
sir
that
these
witnesses
could
testify
to
that
but
not
to
the
identification,
that
the
only
thing
that
would
be
barred
was
their
eye
witness
identification
based
upon
the
lineup
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
not
--
as
i
understand
not
in
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
it’s
not
my
position
my
position
is,
my
position
your
honor
is
that
the
witness
can
testify
to
anything
except
the
identification
that
he
made
there,
in
other
words,
he
testified
at
the
robbery,
he
testified
all
the
facts
that
occurred
and
so
forth
but
he
cannot
testify
that
this
is
a
man
that
did
it,
if
the
rights
of
the
man
were
violated
at
the
lineup.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
that’s
correct
sir.
the
two
accomplices
could.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
it
could
be
sir.
if
the
prosecutor
said,
if
there
is
a
benefit
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
no
sir.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
it’s
open
court
your
honor
and
everyone
is
there
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes,
his
counsel
--
mr.
weldon
holcomb
if
counsel
is
with
his
client
there
in
open
court
and
so
forth
your
honor
and
nothing
else
was
known,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
no
violation.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
certainly
that
has
been
done,
i
think
that
would
be
a
violation
justice.
mr.
weldon
holcomb
yes
sir,
as
i
say
we
all
sustain
position,
i
feel
that
would
be
improper
thank
you.
