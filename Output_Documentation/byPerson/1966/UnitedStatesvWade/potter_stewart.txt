justice
potter
stewart
well
by
both
aspects,
i
want
to
be
sure.
justice
potter
stewart
and
secondly
in
the
sanctions.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
understand
about
the
record,
this
was
not
kept
side
from
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
here
again,
we
have
no
record
of
actually
what
questions
were
asked.
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
we
don’t
know
what
actually
happened
at
glance,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
he
hadn’t
been
notified
of
the
lineup?
justice
potter
stewart
now
by
interviewing
the
witness
you
don’t
mean
equivalent
to
revealing
an
indicted
dependency.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
gather
ms.
rosenberg
if
that’s
the
government
position,
then
indeed
there
is
no
fifth
or
sixth
or
any
other
kind
of
problem
involved
here
since
the
only
effort
is
to
get
the
information
of
a
witness
to
be
used
as
evidence
at
the
trial
because
that’s
it,
and
then
i
would
suppose
the
government’s
position
is
it
is
utterly
immaterial
what
questions
are
asked
to
the
people
in
a
line
up.
even
if
they
are
asked
for
to
say
i
did
or
didn’t
commit
this
offence.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
understand
that’s
the
other
side
of
it.
what
i
--
or
perhaps
i
read
too
much
of
what
you
said,
but
your
emphasis
on
a
line
up
is
nothing
more
than
an
effort
by
the
government
to
interview
one
of
its
own
witnesses
or
perspective
of
it,
now
if
that’s
the
correct
analysis.
it
seems
to
me
it
must
mean
it’s
utterly
immaterial
what
questions
you
put
to
the
people
in
the
line
up
included?
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
this
if
i
may,
that
is
to
say
then
your
position
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
in
the
presence
of
your
perspective
witness
questions
can
be
put
to
the
indicted
defendant
in
a
line
up,
are
you
or
are
you
not
guilty
of
this
offence?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
not
say
that
they
could
that
far.
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
involved
then?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
and
this
is
a
fifth
or
a
sixth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
would
it
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
under
miranda
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly
it
would
be
a
violation
of
both
because
at
least
under
miranda
it’s
the
fifth
amendment
violation
and
under
messiah
if
not
under
miranda
it’s
a
sixth
amendment
of
violation
that’s
right?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
mr.
holcomb,
mr.
albert
instead
of
taking
these
identifying
witnesses
in
the
room
where
they
conducted
a
lineup,
had
taken
the
three
of
them
down
to
the
cell
where
the
respondent
was
being
been
kept.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
didn’t
mr.
albert
walk
down
with
the
identifying
witness
and
said
look
this
man
over.
justice
potter
stewart
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
not
counsel
or
direct
to
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
not
incrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
well
a
whole
purpose
of
the
lineup
though,
why
do
they
have
lineups,
rather
than
take
people
down
to
the
cell?
justice
potter
stewart
what’s
wrong
with
making
clear
judgment
if
that’s
a
found
case
–
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
told
us
that
this
man
was
dressed
differently
from
the
others,
did
you
mean
to
say
that
all
the
others
were
dressed
alike
and
he
was
dressed
differently
or
that
each
one
was
dressed
differently?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don’t
--
there
is
no
indication
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
other
were
dressed
one
way
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
distinctive
way
different
from
the
all
the
others.
justice
potter
stewart
wasn’t
each
---
was
one
of
these
people
in
the
lineup
required
to
use
your
phrase
reenact
a
portion
of
the
crime?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
each
one
constitutional
rights
is
violated?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
asked
to
do
the
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
even
after
you
could
indict
him?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
what
your
point
is,
as
i
understood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
sixth
amendment
argument
is
that
merely
putting
him
in
the
line
up,
when
the
knowledge
of
prosecution,
he
has
a
lawyer
violates
his
sixth
amendment
rights,
if
he
is
under
indictment
at
that
time
they
put
him
in
the
lineup,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
quite
understand
why
you
answered
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
don’t
think
it
could
be
a
violation
in
this
situation
where
it
doesn’t
have
a
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
under
today’s
disconcertion,
by
the
time
you
get
to
indictment,
you
are
likely
to
have
a
lawyer,
so
the
practical
matter
when
i
would
like
to
go
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
holcomb
as
i
understand
it,
if
we
affirm
the
decision
below,
it
means
that
your
client
cannot
effectively
be
tried.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
witnesses
who
saw
him
at
the
lineup
could
not
identify
him
again.
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
holcomb
that
being
so,
i
suppose
the
exclusionary
rule
which
you
argued
for,
the
exclusionary
rule
you
argued
for,
would
be
more
in
the
nature
of
a
prophylactic
rule
to
prevent
denial
by
officers
of
rights
to
counsel,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
without
regard
to
change
or
anything
else
or
the
reliability
of
the
identification
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
surely
have
to
rest
it
on
the
need
for
some
kind
of
prophylactic
rule
in
order
to
protect
the
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment,
not
on
any
argument
which
you
can
make,
can
you
necessarily
that
the
identification
evidence
is
unreliable.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
witnesses
could
say
that
there
was
a
hold
up
that
day,
but
they
couldn’t
say
who
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
we
believe
that,
i
think
you
said
it,
but
i
want
to
be
sure,
if
i
understand
what
you
have
said
and
what
did
happen
here
as
a
matter
of
fact,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
government
in
its
case
in
the
court,
trial
of
this
man,
made
no
use
indeed,
no
mention
whatsoever
of
any
lineup,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
she
made
no
mention.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
that
she
doesn’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
asked
then
to
identify
the
defendant.
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
other
witness?
justice
potter
stewart
and
just
did
you
see
him
here
at
this
courtroom
on
the
tenth
and
the
answer
was
what,
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
then,
was
there
any
description
of
what
happened?
justice
potter
stewart
so
assuming
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
perhaps
the
sixth
amendment
to
ask
somebody
to
say,
how
do
you
do,
if
his
lawyer
isn’t
there,
no
evidence
of
any
such
violation
or
any
such
facts
were
introduced
by
the
government
except
for
the
response
and
this
came
in
response
to
cross
examination
by
the
defendant.
justice
potter
stewart
really
ms.
rosenberg,
that
might
be
an
incident,
of
course,
but
that’s
fair
to
the
defendant.
you
don’t
really
suggest
that
the
purpose
to
have
a
lineup
is
to
be
fair
to
defendant,
isn’t
in
the
purpose
to
be
done
darn
sure
they
have
witnesses
upon
whom
they
can
rely
when
they
go
to
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
it
may
be,
but
they
might
get
into
trouble
with
that
whereas
they
have
someone
who
can
say,
look
there
is
six
or
seven,
but
i
know
what
i’m
talking
about
that’s
the
guy,
when
it
comes
to
that
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
may
work
out
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that’s
certainly
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
by
both
aspects,
i
want
to
be
sure.
justice
potter
stewart
and
secondly
in
the
sanctions.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
understand
about
the
record,
this
was
not
kept
side
from
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
here
again,
we
have
no

as
