justice
abe
fortas
does
intervention
of
the
indictment
make
any
difference
do
you
think?
that
is
to
say
is
there
a
distinction
between
a
pre-indictment
lineup
for
identification
and
a
post
indictment
lineup,
which
it
might
be
suggested
as
part
of
trial
preparation.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
no
that’s
all
right,
i
was
just
going
to
suggest
that
perhaps
purposes
of
post
indictment
lineup
may
be
a
reason
to
--
there
maybe
less
of
a
reason
for
the
state
not
to
take
time
and
trouble
to
his
counsel
and
to
invite
counsel
to
be
there,
then
this
were
a
purely
identification
to
see
whether
this
is
the
man
who
in
effect
should
be
charged.
justice
abe
fortas
they
should
have
had
a
pretty
good
idea
about
that
before
they
got
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
okay,
let
me
ask
you
this,
suppose
that
--
you
said
that,
as
i
understand
it
that
you
might
think
that
a
lineup
created
a
real
problem
in
the
event
that
it
involved
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you
had
a
crime
that
was
committed
by
one
man
and
the
government
stages
to
lineup,
prosecution
stage
for
line
up,
police
stage
for
lineup,
then
they
ask
the
person
who
had
been
indicted
a
single
question,
within
that
line
up
they
had
him
as
the
one
man
there
and
rest
of
them
were
women
and
then
the
witnesses
who
were
there
viewing
the
lineup
went
into
the
court
room
and
they
testified
that
yes,
this
is
the
man
and
they
said
this
fact
that
they
also
testify
that
yes
we
identify
him
with
the
lineup.
justice
abe
fortas
well
if
it
is
a
due
process
question
i
suppose
the
next
problem
is
whether
the
sixth
amendment
right
that
attaches
in
the
sense
that
a
defendant
as
a
constitutional
matter
is
entitled
to
have
counsel
present.
again
i
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
a
due
process
violation
may
arise.
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
holcomb,
suppose
you
were
then
invited
to
the
line
up,
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
you
draw
did
the
distinction
between
current
statement
after
indictment
and
before
indictment?
justice

fortas

fortas

practice
then?
justice
abe
fortas
before
--
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
put
another
hypothetical
to
you.
(inaudible)
would
that
be
a
violation?
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
talking
about
the
waiver,
i
am
talking
about
the
fact
that
whenever
technique
you
possibly
use,
is
not
known
by
the
counsel,
and
his
client
when
he
walked
in
to
the
courtroom
in
the
morning
prior
