justice

what’s
wrong
with
taking
somebody
to
the
cell,
they
do
not
direct
the
man
to
do
anything,
or
to
say
anything
and
let
the
man
that
is
looking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
in
addition
to
that,
he
took
somebody
to
the
cell
and
said
now
we
direct
you
to
answer
these
questions
and
assume
this
position,
what
would
you
say
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
you
are
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
government
simply
having
witnesses
look
at
a
defendant
and
the
government
officers
compelling
him
to
do
something
which
will
be
useful
to
the
government
in
the
prosecution
of
him
for
the
crime
such
as
writing
letters
or
assuming
certain
positions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
court
held
that
with,
but
you
are
not
part.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
that
called?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
use
could
the
government
make
of
this
identification
in
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
not
the
government
use
the
view
of
that
witness
to
ask
him
the
same
question
then,
do
you
see
the
defendant
here,
why
should
they
not
be
allowed
to
do
that
so
long
as
they
not
rely
at
all
upon
what
had
occurred
in
the
lineup?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
i
suppose
that
everyone
would
agree
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
defendant’s
rights.
take
him
down
and
make
him
say
something
like
they
did
here
or
to
take
certain
position,
your
next
problem
is
that
consequence
of
that
and
i
gather
that
your
argument,
that
the
government
would
be
deprived
of
the
use
of
those
people
as
witnesses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
government
had,
had
five
witnesses
to
look
into
it,
that’s
the
only
eye
witnesses
to
the
crime,
you
would
say
that
they
couldn’t
use
a
single
one
of
those
witnesses
why
do
you
have
to
go
that
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
violated
it
in
connection
with
identifying
him
on
the
--
by
reason
of
some
motion
with
and
what
he
said.
why
would
it
not
be
enough
to
deprive
the
government
of
the
benefit
which
is
supposed
to
come
from
a
spontaneous
identification
and
a
lineup
namely
that
i
did
this
when
they
were
in
line
there
and
that
strengthened
my
statement
that
i,
that
i
am
right
in
my
identification.
why
should
it
bar
those
witnesses
from
testifying
with
reference
to
the
other
elements
of
the
crime
which
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
identification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
they
couldn’t
buttress
their
statement
of
identification
by
proving
that
they
had
picked
him
out
in
this
lineup.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright
in
other
words
and
that’s
what
the
court
of
appeals
held,
isn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
government
could
have
brought
in
that
fact,
without
violating
this
man’s
constitutional
rights
in
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
ms.
rosenberg
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
saying
that
the
rights
of
this
defendant
had
been
violated,
but
let
us
say
also
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
was
wrong
as
you
contend
in
applying
the
remedy
that
it
proposes.
my
question
is
what
remedy
could
the
court
of
appeals
have
applied
in

to
vindicate
the
violation
of
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights?

there
would
be
what?
