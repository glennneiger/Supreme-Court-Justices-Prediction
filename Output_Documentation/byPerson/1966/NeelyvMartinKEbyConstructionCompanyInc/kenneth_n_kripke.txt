mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
neely
versus
eby
construction
company
is
a
diversity
tort
case
arising
out
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
colorado.
in
that
court,
the
plaintiff
neely,
who
is
your
petitioner
here
obtained
a
jury
verdict
of
the
amount
of
$25,000.00
which
is
the
maximum
obtainable
under
the
colorado
wrongful
death
act.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
various
motions
for
directive
verdict,
judgment
notwithstanding
verdict
new
trial
and
in
that
posture,
the
defendant
eby
appealed
to
the
united
states
district
--
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
that
court
reversed
and
remanded
with
directions
to
dismiss.
it
was
from
that
order
that
this
matter
was
brought
to
this
court.
in
order
to
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
petitioner
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
interplay
of
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
rule
38
of
the
federal
rules
and
rule
50
with
its
recent
amendments.
the
petitioner
in
that
petition
said
that
she
did
not
concede
for
a
moment
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
on
its
dismissal
in
its
interpretation
of
the
facts
of
that
case
as
the
court
recounted
them
from
the
cold
record.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
so
limited.
i
don't
think
the
directive
said
so
in
so
many
words.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir,
i
did.
yes.
your
honor
--
your
honors,
in
order
to
try
to
describe
the
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no
sir,
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
in
order
to
try
to
orient
the
court
on
what
is
a
rather
unfamiliar
fact
situation,
the
petitioner
attached
to
her
brief
on
the
merits
some
exhibits.
there
are
four
photographs
and
also
a
polaroid
photograph
or
copy
of
one
which
was
a
drawing
on
the
blackboard
in
the
trial.
these
are
all
of
the
exhibits
which
were
admitted
on
the
issues
of
liability.
there
are
--
the
reasons
that
these
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
becomes
very
clear
with
a
study
of
the
factual
background
of
the
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
misinterpreted
the
facts
from
the
cold
record.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes.
i
would
be
willing
your
honor
to
limit
my
remarks
to
this
problem
of
the
application
of
rule
of
the
amendment
7
to
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
dismiss
and
terminate
what
has
been
a
jury
verdict.
i
think
that
the
facts
and
misinterpretation
of
the
facts
illustrates
as
clearly
as
anything
i
can
think
of
your
honor,
why
the
seventh
amendment
was
enacted
in
the
first
place.
mr.
--
if
i
may
i
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
--
give
some
historical
background.
mr.
neely
was
an
engineer
employed
in
a
missile
silo
construction
program
at
elizabeth,
colorado.
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
make
some
measurements
from
some
counterweights
if
i
may
explain
the
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
alright.
i'll
go
directly
to
that
then.
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
says
of
course
that
the
--
that
no
court
may
review
facts
which
have
--
no
federal
court
may
review
facts
which
have
once
been
tried
to
a
jury
except
according
to
the
common
law.
now,
there
have
been
various
allusions
and
interpretations
of
this
before
rule
50
came
into
existence.
back
in
3
peter
as
early
as
that,
there
was
the
parsons
case
which
has
been
referred
to
in
the
briefs
wherein
it
was
stated
that
under
the
common
law
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
a
vast
distinction
between
review
of
a
record
by
a
trial
judge
and
review
on
appeal
of
a
code
record
by
an
appellate
court
and
as
i
started
to
say
in
the
brief
time
available
yesterday,
it
would
appear
that
that
is
what
the
seventh
amendment
is
all
about.
there
is
one
line
of
cases
running
from
slocum
versus
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
down
to
galloway
which
was
immediately
postwar,
i
believe
which
examined
into
the
effect
of
the
seventh
amendment
on
appellate
court
review
and
particularly
on
the
power
of
the
appellate
court
to
reverse
and
dismiss
as
against
the
party
who
had
won
the
verdict
below.
in
the
slocum
case,
the
court
was
construing
pennsylvania
law
and
it
was
said
in
that
case,
i
think
very
flatly,
that
the
appellate
court
has
power
to
review
the
denial
of
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
but
that
the
seventh
amendment
precludes
the
direction
of
judgment
by
the
appellate
court
rather
than
the
ordering
of
a
new
trial.
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
that
case
eliminated,
modified
the
judgment
by
eliminating
the
direction
to
enter
judgment
and
substituted
direction
for
a
new
trial.
following
that
case
very
closely
was
a
federal
employers'
liability
act
case,
the
young
case
at
volume
232
of
the
official
reports
and
that
case
following
slocum
and
citing
slocum
said
that
even
though
there
is
no
evidence
of
negligence
for
the
jury
a
new
trial
should
be
granted
rather
than
the
dismissal
or
entry
of
judgment.
then
came
the
redman
case
at
295
of
the
reports.
justice
--
mr.
justice
van
devanter
wrote
that
opinion
as
he
did
in
the
earlier
case
of
slocum
some
20
years
before
and
in
that
case
which
construed
new
york
law,
mr.
justice
van
devanter
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
the
power
to
reverse
as
against
the
verdict
winner
below
and
to
enter
judgment
against
him.
the
slocum
case
was
distinguished
in
the
redman
case
on
the
ground
of
the
insufficiency
of
--
on
the
ground
that
the
insufficiency
of
evidence
question
was
not
reserve
in
slocum
by
the
verdict
loser
as
it
was
in
redman.
then
followed
the
kennedy
case,
aetna
insurance
company
versus
kennedy
which
followed
slocum
rather
than
redman
and
then
we
had
of
course
the
--
what
i
believe
was
a
very
important
case
of
galloway
which
was
construing
not
the
power
of
an
appellate
court
but
the
power
of
the
trial
judge
with
reference
to
the
entry
of
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
and
there,
even
though
it
was
the
power
of
a
trial
judge
which
was
at
stake
three
justices
dissented
in
that
case.
in
that
case,
the
dissent
pointed
out
that
in
the
english
common
law
as
reported
in
parsons
versus
bedford.
there
was
no
right
or
no
power
rather
in
an
appellate
court
to
reverse
and
dismiss
a
verdict
winner
out
of
court
that
the
most
that
could
be
done
was
to
grant
a
new
trial.
and
that
deserves
some
discussion
because
in
the
redman
case,
the
court
said
there
was
that
power
and
we
discovered
in
reading
the
english
common
law
cases
that
were
cited
in
redman
that
actually
what
was
happening
at
the
common
law
was
this,
that
the
nisi
prius
judges
would
go
out
on
the
circuit
and
try
these
cases
with
the
juries
would
reserve
difficult
questions
of
law,
would
bring
these
questions
back
to
the
court
en
banc
at
westminster
and
obtain
opinions
from
the
group
of
judges,
from
the
brother
judges
en
banc.
this
was
similar
i
think
to
a
procedure
where
a
judge
on
a
trial
level
would
call
back
his
brother
judges
into
chambers
and
say,
“help
me
out
on
this
problem.”
there
was
always
the
contact
of
one
judge,
always
the
contact
of
one
judge
on
this
reviewing
body
who
was
in
the
courtroom,
who
heard
the
witnesses,
who
saw
the
gestures
if
there
was
a
blackboard,
he
saw
the
writing
on
the
blackboard
and
he
had
the
personal
primary
contact
with
that
case.
in
fact,
in
two
of
those
cases
lord
mansfield
was
a
trial
judge
and
then
he
also
was
the
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion.
i'm
talking
about
the
common
law
cases.
therefore,
i
feel
that
insofar
as
redman
indicate
that
there
was
a
power
to
common
law
for
a
--
an
appellate
court
to
review
a
code
record,
i
honestly
think
that
mr.
justice
van
devanter
was
wrong.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
your
honor.
the
postwar
cases
deal
then
with
rule
50
and
i
will
come
down
to
that.
there
were
--
there
are
four
cases
under
rule
50.
there
are
no
cases
yet
under
rule
50
(d)
of
course
but
there
are
four
cases
under
rule
50,
the
cone
case,
the
globe
liquor
case,
the
weade
versus
dichmann
case
and
finally
the
johnson
case
that
i
know
of.
in
each
of
which,
this
court
protected
the
verdict
winner
in
one
way
or
another
by
allowing
a
new
trial
in
each
of
these.
now,
in
none
of
these
was
any
constitutional
question
reached
except
that
in
the
johnson
case,
the
344
of
the
u.s.
reports,
the
court
did
note
that
there
was
discussion
of
the
seventh
amendment
in
redman
and
in
slocum
and
it
mentioned
that
in
passing
but
actually
none
of
those
cases
dealt
with
the
fundamental
question.
i
believe
in
reading
--
it's
my
reading
of
the
cone,
globe
liquor,
weade,
and
johnson
all
of
these
that
what
the
court
was
saying
was
that
we
are
going
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
verdict
winner
below.
now,
we
get
to
rule
50
(c)
and
50
(d)
as
they
were
brought
in
to
the
law
in
1963.
rule
50
(c)
says
in
effect
that
if
the
verdict
winner
loses
on
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding,
which
is
made
by
the
other
party
at
the
trial
level,
then
he
may
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
within
10
days
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
rule
50
(d)
says
that
if
he
wins
that
is
if
the
verdict
winner
is
upheld
by
the
trial
judge
on
the
--
as
against
the
opposing
party's
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
and
motion
for
new
trial
then
he
may
as
appellee
cite
grounds
why
if
by
some
stroke
of
lightning
the
court
of
appeals
should
reverse,
he
may
cite
grounds
as
appellee
as
to
why
he
should
be
permitted
to
remain
in
court.
now,
this
assumes
a
great
deal
of
foresight.
here's
the
situation
at
that
point
as
a
practical
matter.
the
plaintiff
has
--
well,
let's
say
the
plaintiff
because
in
our
situation
we're
the
plaintiff,
it's
easier
for
me
to
think
that
way.
the
plaintiff,
the
verdict
winner
has
the
verdict
at
that
point.
he
has
survived
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
he
has
survived
the
motion
for
new
trial
and
he
has
a
verdict
which
he
thinks
is
pretty
good.
now,
as
a
practical
matter
he
can
order
additional
parts
of
the
record
and
this
no
expense
to
his
client
and
bring
out
a
few
or
a
great
many
errors
which
can
be
briefed
and
researched
that
additional
expense
on
time
and
present
a
full
blown
brief
on
his
side
of
the
case
which
he's
already
won
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
off
--
in
the
possibility
and
the
possible
event
that
by
though
he
may
be
he
didn't
have
the
verdict.
maybe
he's
going
to
lose
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
--
if
that
is
the
interpretation
of
rule
(d)
then
you're
better
off
under
rule
50
(c).
you're
better
off
to
have
the
trial
judge
grant
the
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
against
you
because
then
you
got
10
days
within
which
to
file
your
motion.
you're
better
off
than
under
rule
50
(d)
where
you've
got
to
anticipate
all
these
things
happening.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no,
your
honor.
only
the
testimony
of
four
witnesses,
i
believe
it
was
all
of
the
liability
testimony
at
that
time
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
i'm
sure
it
was.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
that's
right.
now,
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so
even
without
the
constitution.
it
may
not
have
that
power
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes
sir.
yes.
well,
there
was
also
the
question
--
that's
right.
the
question
that
was
certified
by
the
court
with
those,
with
reference
to
the
rule.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
certainly
may
it
please
with
court
with
reference
to
rule
50
(d)
it
would
appear
that
if
that
is
the
construction
of
the
court
we
have
less
right
under
rule
50
(d)
unless
we
say
well
we've
got
to
go
back
to
rule
50
(c).
now,
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
us
out
of
court.
they
didn't
return
this
case
for
a
ruling
on
the
judgment
n.o.v.
or
they
didn't
even
say
that
for
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
--
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
they
simply
dismissed
us
out
of
court
which
permitted
us
no
opportunity
to
go
back
in
under
rule
50
(c)
even
and
get
10
more
days
within
which
to
follow
motion
for
new
trial
on
our
own
ground.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
is
what
rule
50
(d)
means,
then
the
lawyers
of
this
country
have
learned
a
great
deal
because
frankly,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
and
i
don't
know
of
anybody
in
this
entire
courtroom
does
know
of
any
case
where
any
winning
party,
where
any
verdict
winner
has
filed
a
conditional
motion
for
new
trial
or
cited
errors
on
appeal
which
would
redone
in
his
own
favor.
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
at
least
the
testimony
of
two
or
perhaps
three
witnesses
which
reference
to
opinions
as
to
the
scalpel
thing
which
we
would
not
permitted
to
put
any
evidence
and
i
suppose
the
question
with
reference
to
that
is
have
we
failed
to
protect
our
record
by
failing
to
point
to
that
among
other
things
in
the
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
sir
i
believe
i
think
the
rule
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
think
that
the
court
granted
a
cert
on
the
question
i
post
just
as
well
as
the
two
questions
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes.
your
honor,
it
does
say
in
addition
to
all
of
the
questions
presented
by
the
petition.
i
feel
your
honor
that
these
rules
cannot
be
construed
so
as
to
in
any
way
destroy
the
constitutional
provision
amendment
seven
which
has
to
be
paramount.
so
that
it
has
to
be
construed
within
the
bounds
of
amendment
seven.
now,
amendment
seven
does
not
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes.
well,
your
honor
i
think
the
rules
are
to
provide
the
courts
of
appeals
with
a
vehicle
by
which,
the
machinery
by
which
and
the
procedure
by
which
a
review
can
be
done.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
there
is
a
situation
for
instance
a
court
of
appeals
could
dismiss
under
rule
50
in
this
situation
after
a
verdict
winner
wins
the
fourth
trial
but
in
this
situation
where
--
i
want
to
say
there
is
jurisdictional
question
which
is
properly
preserved
either
as
to
a
subject
matter
or
to
in
person.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
then,
i
think
it's
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
reverse
and
dismiss
but
in
that
case
what
you
got,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
reverse
and
dismiss
if
there
is
a
jurisdictional
situation
which
is
properly
preserved
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i
see.
well,
i
think
your
honor
in
that
situation
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
rule
would
permit
only
in
that
limited
situation
where
the
verdict
winner
would
still
be
entitled
he
hasn't
lost
anything
because
he
has
not
been
dismissed
with
prejudice
in
that
situation.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
yes
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes.
well,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
certainly,
with
reference
to
rule
50
(d)
the
advisory
committee
said
this
doesn't
settle
all
the
questions
and
i
quoted
that
in
the
brief.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
your
honor
i
don't
know
how
to
proceed
on
that
point
any
further
than
i
have.
i
believe
that
the
--
i'm
sure
that
the
purpose
of
rule
50
(c)
and
(d)
was
to
try
to
iron
out
these
problems
which
had
been
plaguing
the
court,
which
have
been
plaguing
the
bench
and
bar
with
reference
to
the
application
of
the
constitution
to
the
appellate
power.
but
i
don't
see
how
by
appellate
--
by
rule
we
can
change
the
constitutional
scope
in
anyway.
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
have
this
further
to
say
and
that
is
that
not
only
does
rule
50
not
give
the
power
to
the
circuit
court
to
reverse
and
dismiss
but
it
couldn't.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
rule
50
(d)
and
in
the
sentence
which
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
to
counsel
a
moment
ago
the
framers
of
the
rule
we're
trying
to
preserve
to
verdict
winners
some
vestiges
of
the
verdict
that
they
have
won.
the
sentence
reads
if
the
appellate
court
reverses
the
judgment
nothing
in
this
rule
precludes
it
from
determining
that
the
appellee
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
or
from
directing
the
trial
judge
--
the
trial
court
to
determine
whether
a
new
trial
shall
be
granted.
i
don't
think
that
the
framers
of
the
rule
ever
thought
that
they
could
go
beyond
the
--
what
the
seventh
amendment
says
with
rule
50
(d)
and
obviously
it
--
such
a
--
the
rule
does
not.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
you
passed
the
verdict
too?
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
oh
dear!
i
would
say
no
sir.
i
don't
see
how
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
this
is
a
situation
where
the
trial
judge
has
denied
the
motion
for
judgment
n.o.v.
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
oh,
has
granted
under
rule
(c)
and
also
granted
the
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
oh,
i
see.
may
it
please
the
court?
i
don't
think
we
get
to
that.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i
see
a
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i
can't
answer
that
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
know.
i
think
as
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
the
difference
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i
think
i
see
the
distinction.
here,
the
trial
judge
in
the
first
instance
under
the
language
of
the
cone
case
has
the
--
have
the
power
to
--
has
ruled
on
this
and
has
said
that
the
--
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
bring
the
case
to
a
jury
in
the
first
place.
that
i
think,
your
honor,
is
a
very
important
difference.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
oh,
no
i
wouldn't
say
that.
the
appellate
court
can
reverse
but
it
cannot
reverse
and
dismiss.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
if
the
trial
judge
in
his
determination
after
sitting
at
the
trial
decides
that
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
reach
a
jury
question
then
he
so
rules.
then,
there
has
been
a
determination
of
that
kind
from
which
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no,
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
neely
versus
eby
construction
company
is
a
diversity
tort
case
arising
out
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
colorado.
in
that
court,
the
plaintiff
neely,
who
is
your
petitioner
here
obtained
a
jury
verdict
of
the
amount
of
$25,000.00
which
is
the
maximum
obtainable
under
the
colorado
wrongful
death
act.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
various
motions
for
directive
verdict,
judgment
notwithstanding
verdict
new
trial
and
in
that
posture,
the
defendant
eby
appealed
to
the
united
states
district
--
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
that
court
reversed
and
remanded
with
directions
to
dismiss.
it
was
from
that
order
that
this
matter
was
brought
to
this
court.
in
order
to
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
petitioner
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
interplay
of
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
rule
38
of
the
federal
rules
and
rule
50
with
its
recent
amendments.
the
petitioner
in
that
petition
said
that
she
did
not
concede
for
a
moment
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
on
its
dismissal
in
its
interpretation
of
the
facts
of
that
case
as
the
court
recounted
them
from
the
cold
record.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
so
limited.
i
don't
think
the
directive
said
so
in
so
many
words.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir,
i
did.
yes.
your
honor
--
your
honors,
in
order
to
try
to
describe
the
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no
sir,
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
in
order
to
try
to
orient
the
court
on
what
is
a
rather
unfamiliar
fact
situation,
the
petitioner
attached
to
her
brief
on
the
merits
some
exhibits.
there
are
four
photographs
and
also
a
polaroid
photograph
or
copy
of
one
which
was
a
drawing
on
the
blackboard
in
the
trial.
these
are
all
of
the
exhibits
which
were
admitted
on
the
issues
of
liability.
there
are
--
the
reasons
that
these
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
becomes
very
clear
with
a
study
of
the
factual
background
of
the
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
misinterpreted
the
facts
from
the
cold
record.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes.
i
would
be
willing
your
honor
to
limit
my
remarks
to
this
problem
of
the
application
of
rule
of
the
amendment
7
to
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
dismiss
and
terminate
what
has
been
a
jury
verdict.
i
think
that
the
facts
and
misinterpretation
of
the
facts
illustrates
as
clearly
as
anything
i
can
think
of
your
honor,
why
the
seventh
amendment
was
enacted
in
the
first
place.
mr.
--
if
i
may
i
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
--
give
some
historical
background.
mr.
neely
was
an
engineer
employed
in
a
missile
silo
construction
program
at
elizabeth,
colorado.
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
make
some
measurements
from
some
counterweights
if
i
may
explain
the
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
alright.
i'll
go
directly
to
that
then.
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
says
of
course
that
the
--
that
no
court
may
review
facts
which
have
--
no
federal
court
may
review
facts
which
have
once
been
tried
to
a
jury
except
according
to
the
common
law.
now,
there
have
been
various
allusions
and
interpretations
of
this
before
rule
50
came
into
existence.
back
in
3
peter
as
early
as
that,
there
was
the
parsons
case
which
has
been
referred
to
in
the
briefs
wherein
it
was
stated
that
under
the
common
law
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
a
vast
distinction
between
review
of
a
record
by
a
trial
judge
and
review
on
appeal
of
a
code
record
by
an
appellate
court
and
as
i
started
to
say
in
the
brief
time
available
yesterday,
it
would
appear
that
that
is
what
the
seventh
amendment
is
all
about.
there
is
one
line
of
cases
running
from
slocum
versus
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
down
to
galloway
which
was
immediately
postwar,
i
believe
which
examined
into
the
effect
of
the
seventh
amendment
on
appellate
court
review
and
particularly
on
the
power
of
the
appellate
court
to
reverse
and
dismiss
as
against
the
party
who
had
won
the
verdict
below.
in
the
slocum
case,
the
court
was
construing
pennsylvania
law
and
it
was
said
in
that
case,
i
think
very
flatly,
that
the
appellate
court
has
power
to
review
the
denial
of
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
but
that
the
seventh
amendment
precludes
the
direction
of
judgment
by
the
appellate
court
rather
than
the
ordering
of
a
new
trial.
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
that
case
eliminated,
modified
the
judgment
by
eliminating
the
direction
to
enter
judgment
and
substituted
direction
for
a
new
trial.
following
that
case
very
closely
was
a
federal
employers'
liability
act
case,
the
young
case
at
volume
232
of
the
official
reports
and
that
case
following
slocum
and
citing
slocum
said
that
even
though
there
is
no
evidence
of
negligence
for
the
jury
a
new
trial
should
be
granted
rather
than
the
dismissal
or
entry
of
judgment.
then
came
the
redman
case
at
295
of
the
reports.
justice
--
mr.
justice
van
devanter
wrote
that
opinion
as
he
did
in
the
earlier
case
of
slocum
some
20
years
before
and
in
that
case
which
construed
new
york
law,
mr.
justice
van
devanter
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
the
power
to
reverse
as
against
the
verdict
winner
below
and
to
enter
judgment
against
him.
the
slocum
case
was
distinguished
in
the
redman
case
on
the
ground
of
the
insufficiency
of
--
on
the
ground
that
the
insufficiency
of
evidence
question
was
not
reserve
in
slocum
by
the
verdict
loser
as
it
was
in
redman.
then
followed
the
kennedy
case,
aetna
insurance
company
versus
kennedy
which
followed
slocum
rather
than
redman
and
then
we
had
of
course
the
--
what
i
believe
was
a
very
important
case
of
galloway
which
was
construing
not
the
power
of
an
appellate
court
but
the
power
of
the
trial
judge
with
reference
to
the
entry
of
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
and
there,
even
though
it
was
the
power
of
a
trial
judge
which
was
at
stake
three
justices
dissented
in
that
case.
in
that
case,
the
dissent
pointed
out
that
in
the
english
common
law
as
reported
in
parsons
versus
bedford.
there
was
no
right
or
no
power
rather
in
an
appellate
court
to
reverse
and
dismiss
a
verdict
winner
out
of
court
that
the
most
that
could
be
done
was
to
grant
a
new
trial.
and
that
deserves
some
discussion
because
in
the
redman
case,
the
court
said
there
was
that
power
and
we
discovered
in
reading
the
english
common
law
cases
that
were
cited
in
redman
that
actually
what
was
happening
at
the
common
law
was
this,
that
the
nisi
prius
judges
would
go
out
on
the
circuit
and
try
these
cases
with
the
juries
would
reserve
difficult
questions
of
law,
would
bring
these
questions
back
to
the
court
en
banc
at
westminster
and
obtain
opinions
from
the
group
of
judges,
from
the
brother
judges
en
banc.
this
was
similar
i
think
to
a
procedure
where
a
judge
on
a
trial
level
would
call
back
his
brother
judges
into
chambers
and
say,
“help
me
out
on
this
problem.”
there
was
always
the
contact
of
one
judge,
always
the
contact
of
one
judge
on
this
reviewing
body
who
was
in
the
courtroom,
who
heard
the
witnesses,
who
saw
the
gestures
if
there
was
a
blackboard,
he
saw
the
writing
on
the
blackboard
and
he
had
the
personal
primary
contact
with
that
case.
in
fact,
in
two
of
those
cases
lord
mansfield
was
a
trial
judge
and
then
he
also
was
the
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion.
i'm
talking
about
the
common
law
cases.
therefore,
i
feel
that
insofar
as
redman
indicate
that
there
was
a
power
to
common
law
for
a
--
an
appellate
court
to
review
a
code
record,
i
honestly
think
that
mr.
justice
van
devanter
was
wrong.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
your
honor.
the
postwar
cases
deal
then
with
rule
50
and
i
will
come
down
to
that.
there
were
--
there
are
four
cases
under
rule
50.
there
are
no
cases
yet
under
rule
50
(d)
of
course
but
there
are
four
cases
under
rule
50,
the
cone
case,
the
globe
liquor
case,
the
weade
versus
dichmann
case
and
finally
the
johnson
case
that
i
know
of.
in
each
of
which,
this
court
protected
the
verdict
winner
in
one
way
or
another
by
allowing
a
new
trial
in
each
of
these.
now,
in
none
of
these
was
any
constitutional
question
reached
except
that
in
the
johnson
case,
the
344
of
the
u.s.
reports,
the
court
did
note
that
there
was
discussion
of
the
seventh
amendment
in
redman
and
in
slocum
and
it
mentioned
that
in
passing
but
actually
none
of
those
cases
dealt
with
the
fundamental
question.
i
believe
in
reading
--
it's
my
reading
of
the
cone,
globe
liquor,
weade,
and
johnson
all
of
these
that
what
the
court
was
saying
was
that
we
are
going
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
verdict
winner
below.
now,
we
get
to
rule
50
(c)
and
50
(d)
as
they
were
brought
in
to
the
law
in
1963.
rule
50
(c)
says
in
effect
that
if
the
verdict
winner
loses
on
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding,
which
is
made
by
the
other
party
at
the
trial
level,
then
he
may
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
within
10
days
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
rule
50
(d)
says
that
if
he
wins
that
is
if
the
verdict
winner
is
upheld
by
the
trial
judge
on
the
--
as
against
the
opposing
party's
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
and
motion
for
new
trial
then
he
may
as
appellee
cite
grounds
why
if
by
some
stroke
of
lightning
the
court
of
appeals
should
reverse,
he
may
cite
grounds
as
appellee
as
to
why
he
should
be
permitted
to
remain
in
court.
now,
this
assumes
a
great
deal
of
foresight.
here's
the
situation
at
that
point
as
a
practical
matter.
the
plaintiff
has
--
well,
let's
say
the
plaintiff
because
in
our
situation
we're
the
plaintiff,
it's
easier
for
me
to
think
that
way.
the
plaintiff,
the
verdict
winner
has
the
verdict
at
that
point.
he
has
survived
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
he
has
survived
the
motion
for
new
trial
and
he
has
a
verdict
which
he
thinks
is
pretty
good.
now,
as
a
practical
matter
he
can
order
additional
parts
of
the
record
and
this
no
expense
to
his
client
and
bring
out
a
few
or
a
great
many
errors
which
can
be
briefed
and
researched
that
additional
expense
on
time
and
present
a
full
blown
brief
on
his
side
of
the
case
which
he's
already
won
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
off
--
in
the
possibility
and
the
possible
event
that
by
though
he
may
be
he
didn't
have
the
verdict.
maybe
he's
going
to
lose
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
--
if
that
is
the
interpretation
of
rule
(d)
then
you're
better
off
under
rule
50
(c).
you're
better
off
to
have
the
trial
judge
grant
the
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
against
you
because
then
you
got
10
days
within
which
to
file
your
motion.
you're
better
off
than
under
rule
50
(d)
where
you've
got
to
anticipate
all
these
things
happening.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no,
your
honor.
only
the
testimony
of
four
witnesses,
i
believe
it
was
all
of
the
liability
testimony
at
that
time
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
i'm
sure
it
was.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
that's
right.
now,
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so
even
without
the
constitution.
it
may
not
have
that
power
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes
sir.
yes.
well,
there
was
also
the
question
--
that's
right.
the
question
that
was
certified
by
the
court
with
those,
with
reference
to
the
rule.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
certainly
may
it
please
with
court
with
reference
to
rule
50
(d)
it
would
appear
that
if
that
is
the
construction
of
the
court
we
have
less
right
under
rule
50
(d)
unless
we
say
well
we've
got
to
go
back
to
rule
50
(c).
now,
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
us
out
of
court.
they
didn't
return
this
case
for
a
ruling
on
the
judgment
n.o.v.
or
they
didn't
even
say
that
for
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
--
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
they
simply
dismissed
us
out
of
court
which
permitted
us
no
opportunity
to
go
back
in
under
rule
50
(c)
even
and
get
10
more
days
within
which
to
follow
motion
for
new
trial
on
our
own
ground.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
is
what
rule
50
(d)
means,
then
the
lawyers
of
this
country
have
learned
a
great
deal
because
frankly,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
and
i
don't
know
of
anybody
in
this
entire
courtroom
does
know
of
any
case
where
any
winning
party,
where
any
verdict
winner
has
filed
a
conditional
motion
for
new
trial
or
cited
errors
on
appeal
which
would
redone
in
his
own
favor.
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
at
least
the
testimony
of
two
or
perhaps
three
witnesses
which
reference
to
opinions
as
to
the
scalpel
thing
which
we
would
not
permitted
to
put
any
evidence
and
i
suppose
the
question
with
reference
to
that
is
have
we
failed
to
protect
our
record
by
failing
to
point
to
that
among
other
things
in
the
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
sir
i
believe
i
think
the
rule
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
think
that
the
court
granted
a
cert
on
the
question
i
post
just
as
well
as
the
two
questions
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes.
your
honor,
it
does
say
in
addition
to
all
of
the
questions
presented
by
the
petition.
i
feel
your
honor
that
these
rules
cannot
be
construed
so
as
to
in
any
way
destroy
the
constitutional
provision
amendment
seven
which
has
to
be
paramount.
so
that
it
has
to
be
construed
within
the
bounds
of
amendment
seven.
now,
amendment
seven
does
not
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes.
well,
your
honor
i
think
the
rules
are
to
provide
the
courts
of
appeals
with
a
vehicle
by
which,
the
machinery
by
which
and
the
procedure
by
which
a
review
can
be
done.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
there
is
a
situation
for
instance
a
court
of
appeals
could
dismiss
under
rule
50
in
this
situation
after
a
verdict
winner
wins
the
fourth
trial
but
in
this
situation
where
--
i
want
to
say
there
is
jurisdictional
question
which
is
properly
preserved
either
as
to
a
subject
matter
or
to
in
person.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
then,
i
think
it's
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
reverse
and
dismiss
but
in
that
case
what
you
got,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
reverse
and
dismiss
if
there
is
a
jurisdictional
situation
which
is
properly
preserved
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i
see.
well,
i
think
your
honor
in
that
situation
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
rule
would
permit
only
in
that
limited
situation
where
the
verdict
winner
would
still
be
entitled
he
hasn't
lost
anything
because
he
has
not
been
dismissed
with
prejudice
in
that
situation.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
yes
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes.
well,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
certainly,
with
reference
to
rule
50
(d)
the
advisory
committee
said
this
doesn't
settle
all
the
questions
and
i
quoted
that
in
the
brief.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
well,
your
honor
i
don't
know
how
to
proceed
on
that
point
any
further
than
i
have.
i
believe
that
the
--
i'm
sure
that
the
purpose
of
rule
50
(c)
and
(d)
was
to
try
to
iron
out
these
problems
which
had
been
plaguing
the
court,
which
have
been
plaguing
the
bench
and
bar
with
reference
to
the
application
of
the
constitution
to
the
appellate
power.
but
i
don't
see
how
by
appellate
--
by
rule
we
can
change
the
constitutional
scope
in
anyway.
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
have
this
further
to
say
and
that
is
that
not
only
does
rule
50
not
give
the
power
to
the
circuit
court
to
reverse
and
dismiss
but
it
couldn't.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
rule
50
(d)
and
in
the
sentence
which
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
to
counsel
a
moment
ago
the
framers
of
the
rule
we're
trying
to
preserve
to
verdict
winners
some
vestiges
of
the
verdict
that
they
have
won.
the
sentence
reads
if
the
appellate
court
reverses
the
judgment
nothing
in
this
rule
precludes
it
from
determining
that
the
appellee
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
or
from
directing
the
trial
judge
--
the
trial
court
to
determine
whether
a
new
trial
shall
be
granted.
i
don't
think
that
the
framers
of
the
rule
ever
thought
that
they
could
go
beyond
the
--
what
the
seventh
amendment
says
with
rule
50
(d)
and
obviously
it
--
such
a
--
the
rule
does
not.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
you
passed
the
verdict
too?
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
oh
dear!
i
would
say
no
sir.
i
don't
see
how
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
this
is
a
situation
where
the
trial
judge
has
denied
the
motion
for
judgment
n.o.v.
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
oh,
has
granted
under
rule
(c)
and
also
granted
the
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
oh,
i
see.
may
it
please
the
court?
i
don't
think
we
get
to
that.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i
see
a
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i
can't
answer
that
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
know.
i
think
as
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
the
difference
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i
think
i
see
the
distinction.
here,
the
trial
judge
in
the
first
instance
under
the
language
of
the
cone
case
has
the
--
have
the
power
to
--
has
ruled
on
this
and
has
said
that
the
--
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
bring
the
case
to
a
jury
in
the
first
place.
that
i
think,
your
honor,
is
a
very
important
difference.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
oh,
no
i
wouldn't
say
that.
the
appellate
court
can
reverse
but
it
cannot
reverse
and
dismiss.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no.
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
if
the
trial
judge
in
his
determination
after
sitting
at
the
trial
decides
that
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
reach
a
jury
question
then
he
so
rules.
then,
there
has
been
a
determination
of
that
kind
from
which
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
kenneth
n.
kripke
no,
sir,
i
don't.
