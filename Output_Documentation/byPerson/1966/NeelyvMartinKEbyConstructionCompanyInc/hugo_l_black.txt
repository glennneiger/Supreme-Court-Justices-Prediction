suppose
you

why
do

why
do
you
say
that
this

give

a
right
to
decide
for
its
sentence
when
it
had
never
heard
the

whether

--
justice

--
rather
than
dismiss?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
don't
see
how
the
rules
can
possibly
permit
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
that.
i
just
don't
see
how
it
possibly
can
because
when
it
is
doing
is
denying
the
right
of
trial
by
jury.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
may
it
please
the
court,
in
reviewing
in
great
detail
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
asked
you
discuss
what
whether
the
rule
permits
them
to
do
that
very
thing,
some
others
doubt
it,
they
refused.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
discussed
the
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
try
to
state
to
you
what
i
think
the
issue
is
that
we
gave
you
to
argue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
question
after
a
person
has
a
case
reversed.
frequently,
there
are
reasons
why
the
situation
was
said
that
he
should've
been
granted
a
new
trial
rather
than
have
his
case
dismissed.
the
cases
before
this
rule
was
amended
last
time
had
expressed
that
right
as
being
guaranteed
by
the
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
the
right
or
power
to
grant
a
new
trial
or
rather
dismiss
the
case.
the
question
is
whether
the
rule
and
the
present
form
does
deny
that
court,
that
power
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
that's
the
only
question
we
have
presented.
the
constitutional
question
is
not
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
the
adoption
of
rule
50
(d)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(d)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
50
(d).
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
undoubtedly,
the
district
judge
has
that
power
but
the
district
judge
didn't
have
that
power
before
the
amendment
unless
that
motion
was
made.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
power
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
direct
the
dismissal
of
the
case
rather
than
dissent
it
back
to
the
district
judge
to
exercise
his
discretion
has
been
indicated
in
the
former
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
must
do
and
would
abstain
from
dismissing
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
read
the
sentence
that
authorized
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
do
you
find
anything
like
that
statement
in
rule
50?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
not
there,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
rule
50
and
that
rule
was
in
existence,
that
provision
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
cone
case
and
the
other
cases
were
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
certainly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
had
never
been
the
rule
up
to
that
time?
that
had
never
been
rule
up
to
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
a
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
left
the
language
as
well.
as
i
read
rule
50
(d)
says
to
get
you
down
specifically
to
the
point
that
the
court
--
appellate
court
may
on
motion
have
a
motion
grant
on
new
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
say,
to
deny
a
new
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
say
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
say
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
not
say
it
in
the
cone
case
the
other
cases
have
filed,
discussed
their
power
to
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
stable
but
under
the
law
and
under
the
rule
then
why
they
could
not
deny
a
new
trial,
they
had
to
let
that
be
acted
on,
i
mean
deny
a
new
trial
that
had
to
be
acted
on
by
the
district
court.
now,
how
do
you
get
around
that
principle
is
still
applying
to
the
rule
50
(d)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
grant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
read
cone
and
the
other
cases
--
have
you
read
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
based
largely
on
the
fact
that
case
tried
by
district
judge
after
a
judgment
is
rendered
one
way
or
the
other
may
have
been
tried
in
such
way
that
its
claim
had
the
law
been
different
or
had
the
circumstances
been
different.
a
new
trial
would've
been
just
right
how
the
defendant
who
lost
the
case
as
it
was.
and
the
philosophy
of
that
case
was
that
it
was
desirable
that
that
discretion
be
exercised
by
the
district
judge
that
which
familiar
with
the
case
and
not
by
the
court
of
appeals.
what
do
you
find
in
the
rule
that
rejects
the
adoptions?
what
do
you
find
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
find
that
indicates
they
wanted
to
change
that
doctrine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
they
have
said
--
you
think
where
they
said
read
a
new
trial
they
really
meant
to
deny--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
have
been
a
history
of
that
rule.
what
about
there
was
a
decided
distinction
between
the
two
granting
and
denying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
that's
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
reserving
it
on
the
part
of
the
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
that's
your
position
on
what
we
want
to
do
to
discuss
or
to
tell
us
why
you
could
find
that
in
the
rule
50
(d)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
thing
in
the
rule
that
indicates
he
had
a
right
to
grant
a
new
trial?
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
right
to
grant
new
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
cone
case
was
based
on
the
duncan
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
even
the
district
judge
couldn't
do
it
without
that
motion
but
it
did
not
indicate
the
court
of
appeals
could
ever
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
is
not
whether
he's
been
denied
the
right
to
seek
a
new
trial,
the
sole
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
right
to
grant
it
to
it.
justice

why
not
judicial
--
that
provision
was
in
the

at
the
time
the

and
it
was
not
held
to
be
enough
to
allow
the
court
of
appeals
to
grant
a
new
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
not
merely
for
that
reason
because
that
we
carefully
explained
it,
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
district
judge
was
the
one
to
decide
it
and
not
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
in
the
cone
and
the
frankfort
case.
that's
what
the
case
was
all
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
read
the
cone
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
read
the
part
that
said,
why
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
one
not
to
do
it
and
the
district
court
is
the
one
to
do
it?
justice

it
would

justice
