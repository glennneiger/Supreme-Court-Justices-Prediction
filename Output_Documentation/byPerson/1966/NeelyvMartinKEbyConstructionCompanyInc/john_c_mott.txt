mr.
john
c.
mott
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
i
believe
there
are
three
issues
that
are
before
this
court
of
this
time.
first
issue
being
does
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
power
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case
namely
to
reverse
and
remand
for
dismissal
and
as
counsel
brings
it
out
in
his
brief
that
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
seventh
amendment.
the
second,
if
it
please
the
court
is,
was
the
exercise
of
this
power
by
the
court
of
the
appeals
properly
requested
by
the
parties
and
i
submit
that
the
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
cone
case
and
globe
case
and
the
johnson
case.
and
the
third,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
third
question
was
the
petitioner,
the
plaintiff
and
the
trial
court
deprived
of
any
right
to
seek
a
new
trial
by
virtue
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
that
i
submit
and
it
requires
an
interpretation
of
rule
50
(d).
now,
on
broad
outline
i
answer
these
three
questions,
first
that
the
court
of
appeals
definitely
does
have
the
power
to
do
what
it
did
by
virtue
of
the
judicial
code
which
we
cited
in
the
brief
and
also
under
the
rule.
i
also
submit
that
the
exercise
of
this
power
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
properly
requested
and
lastly,
i
say
that
the
petitioner
was
not
deprived
of
any
right
to
seek
a
new
trial
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
alright
sir.
i'll
try
to
answer
that
in
the
best
way
i
can.
mr.
john
c.
mott
the
case
is
which
the
court
requested
us
to
look
into
and
brief
the
cone
case,
gold
and
weade
as
i
read
them
were
decided
before
the
adoption
of
rule
50
(d).
mr.
john
c.
mott
(d).
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes.
mr.
john
c.
mott
now,
in
each
on
of
those
cases,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court
after
an
adverse
jury
verdict
was
received
moved
for
a
new
trial.
in
the
johnson
case,
they
moved
to
set
aside
the
judgment
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
in
each
of
those
three
cases
they
did
not
move
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
this
court
held
in
each
one
of
those
cases
that
because
no
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
made
before
the
trial
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
on
appeal
did
not
have
the
power
to
reverse
and
dismiss.
now,
my
interpretation,
in
my
humble
opinion,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
those
three
cases
is
that
the
correlative
must
be
true
of
that
proposition
namely
that
if
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
is
requested
at
the
trial
court
level
then
the
court
of
appeal
does
have
the
power
to
reverse
and
dismiss.
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
i
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
judicial
code
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
and
which
we
quote
the
verbatim
clearly
authorizes
what
the
circuit
court
did
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
his
case.
mr.
john
c.
mott
now,
on
page
three
of
my
answer
brief,
i
think
it's
also
in
the
brief
on
the
--
in
our
position
to
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
the
supreme
court
or
any
other
court
of
appellate
jurisdiction
may
affirm
modify,
vacate,
set
aside,
or
reverse
any
judgment,
decree
or
order
of
court
lawfully
brought
before
review
and
may
remand
the
cause
and
direct
the
entry
of
such
appropriate
judgment
decree
or
order
or
require
such
further
proceedings
to
be
had
as
maybe
just
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
this
--
on
the
cone?
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
as
i
understand
it
cone
was
decided
in
1946
in
the
code
that
i
have
referred
to
was
decided
or
was
enacted
in
1948.
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
it's
a
provision.
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
now,
my
interpretation
to
that
and
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
be
facetious
in
this
at
all
mr.
justice
black
is
this,
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
basic
right
under
the
judicial
code
as
it's
always
had
to
reverse
and
affirm,
modify,
vacate
and
so
forth.
before
rule
50
(d)
was
adopted,
we
had
rule
50
(c)
which
stated
that
if
a
case
is
reversed
on
appeal
that
--
well,
no
rule
50
(c)
said,
that
if
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
granted
below
then
the
trial
court
could
entertain
the
motion
for
new
trial
10
days
thereafter.
then,
we
come
along
with
rule
50
(d)
which
in
my
opinion
if
it
please
the
court
is
not
a
rule
from
which
the
court
of
appeals
obtains
the
raw
power
to
do
what
it
did
but
is
merely
permissive
insofar
is
the
court
of
appeals
is
concern.
in
other
words,
as
i
read
it,
it
says
that
in
addition
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
right
to
do
generally
under
rule
50
(d)
nothing
prohibits
the
court
of
appeals
from
granting
a
new
trial
if
it's
so
desire.
in
other
words,
i
take
that
is
not
the
words
of
restriction
insofar
as
the
court
of
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
i
think
that's
inherent
and
it
does
not
say
the
specific
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
sir?
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
my
explanation
to
that
mr.
justice
black
is
this,
that
if
we
take
the
two
rules
(c)
and
(d)
to
get
which
we
must
in
this
case
because
they
were
both
enforced
when
this
case
was
tried.
rule
50
(c)
takes
the
situation
where
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
is
denied
--
is
granted.
in
that
case,
if
the
loser
in
that
case
is
the
verdict
winner
wants
a
new
trial
then
he
has
under
that
rule
the
right
as
well
as
the
responsibility
of
asking
the
trial
court
for
the
new
trial
10
days
after
the
judgment
of
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
if
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
is
denied
as
it
was
in
this
case
so
long
with
the
motion
for
new
trial
if
it
is
denied
as
i
read
rule
50
(d),
it
says
that
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
verdict
winner
to
seek
a
new
trial
must
be
as
“appellee”
and
although
they
don't
say
“appellee”
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
we
can
assume
that
that
is
the
only
court
in
which
in
the
federal
system
and
which
a
party
is
called
an
“appellee.”
so,
they
say
as
“appellee”
he
may
urge
grounds
on
which
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
in
other
words,
if
you
win
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
you
have
to
seek
your
new
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
rule
50
(d).
if
you
lose
the
motion
for
not
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
you
can
request
new
trial
under
rule
50
(c)
from
the
district
court.
then
the
rule
goes
on
to
say
if
it
please
the
court
that
nothing
in
rule
50
(d)
shall
be
denied
the
court
of
appeals
the
right
to
grant
a
new
trial
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
but
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
i
have.
mr.
john
c.
mott
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
in
rule
50
(d),
i
think
it
says
that
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
(voice
overlap)
it
says
nothing.
to
me,
if
it
says
that
nothing
prohibits
the
court
of
appeals
the
right
to
grant
a
new
trial.
i
don't
think
that
that
insinuates
the
court
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
certainly
there
was.
it
all
goes
back
to
the
old
proposition
that
grew
up
for
many
years
ago
with
regard
to
the
questions
of
law
being
purports
to
determine
and
questions
of
fact
for
juries.
of
course
the
--
no
one
has
ever
challenged
the
power
of
the
trial
court
to
decide
a
case
on
questions
of
law
and
direct
the
verdict
to
dismiss
the
case
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
c.
mott
then
they
used
the
device
of
reversing
that
position
until
after
the
trial
was
had
so
they
could
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes
sir.
in
slocum
or
redman
it
said
that
that
question
having
been
reserved
by
the
district
court
could
then
be
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
then
we
came
along
of
course
to
rule
50
which
deal
way
with
the
necessity
of
a
specific
reservation
of
that
right
and
said
that
every
time
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
was
made
in
the
trial
court
under
rule
50
(d)
or
rule
50
(d).
the
questions
of
law
are
preserved.
in
my
interpretation
is
that
those
questions
of
law
which
are
reserved
under
rule
50
(d)
can
be
determined
on
appeal
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
i
don't
think
it
is
in
rule
50
(d).
oh,
rule
50
(d)
as
i
read
it
says
that
nothing
prohibits
the
court
from
granting
a
new
trial
of
a
court
of
appeals
from
granting
a
new
trial
if
he
wants
to.
mr.
john
c.
mott
not
specifically
however
in
the
duncan
case,
montgomery
ward
versus
duncan
in
which
rule
50
was
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
as
i
read
the
cone
case
the
fatal
defect
that
occurred
in
that
case
at
the
trial
court
level
was
the
failure
of
the
defendant
in
that
case
to
move
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
that
isn't
the
way
i
read
the
duncan
case,
sir.
they're
saying
in
the
duncan
case
they
say
that
if
motion
for
new
trial
is
made
if
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
is
made
at
the
trial
court
level
if
both
motions
are
denied
then
the
court
of
appeals
can
reverse
and
dismiss
without
to
say
reverse
and
dismiss.
it
says
it
can
decide
the
questions
of
law
and
i
submit
that's
exactly
what
was
done
in
this
case
that
what
the
circuit
court
of
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
was
to
decide
the
questions
of
law
which
were
improperly
decided
below.
and
as
far
as
the
cone
case
is
concern
my
view
of
that
case
is
that
it
says
that
because
no
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
made
below
the
appellant
in
the
court
of
appeals
actually
had
no
right
to
ask
that
court
for
a
reversal
and
you
can't
have
something
that
you're
not
--
you
don't
ask
for
and
that
was
the
basis
as
i
read
the
case
on
which
the
decision
rested.
now,
there
was
comment
on
the
cone
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
the
effect
that
in
the
trial
court
if
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
made
and
if
it
look
like
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
case
that
the
motion
was
going
to
be
granted
he
would
have
the
right
under
rule
41
to
ask
for
a
voluntary
dismissal
of
the
case
and
start
over
or
he
might
have
saw
the
handwriting
on
the
wall
and
ask
for
a
new
trial.
well,
and
in
that
case
as
i
read
it,
the
fact
the
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
not
asked
for
in
the
trial
court
may
have
in
that
particular
case
deprive
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
to
ask
for
something
he
otherwise
might've
asked
for.
but
i
submit
under
rule
50
(d)
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
not
been
denied
the
right
to
seek
a
new
trial
that
she
neglected
to
seek
a
new
trial
under
rule
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
i
say
that
under
the
judicial
code
the
power
is
there
and
also
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
merely
because
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
not
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
in
cone?
mr.
john
c.
mott
in
the
cone
case.
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
i'm
in
a
peculiar
position,
if
it
please
your
honor,
i
know
you
wrote
the
decision
and
certainly
you
should
know
more
about
it
than
i
or
anyone
else
in
this
room
but
to
me
i
didn't
ever
read
in
the
cone
case
any
prohibition
on
the
general
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes
sir,
i
did.
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
it
said
that
before
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
trial
court's
thinking
as
to
whether
a
new
trial
or
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
should
be
granted.
and
that
that
would
be
helpful
but
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
maybe
i'm
not
using
absolutely
the
correct
term
there
but
at
that
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
i
think
that's
a
better
word
but
it
didn't
say
that
the
power
was
unfair
and
that's
what
i
think
we
disagree.
sir?
mr.
john
c.
mott
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
the
power
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
as
i
read
it,
it
said
that
because
the
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
not
requested
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
power
to
grant
such
relief.
in
other
words,
you
can't
have
something
you
don't
ask
for
and
that's
what
i
submit
is
the
situation
with
the
plaintiff
here
in
--
with
regard
to
rule
50
(d)
that
she
didn't
ask
for
a
new
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
therefore
she
can't
complain
that
she
wasn't
granted
that
relief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
would
like
to
conclude
that
in
my
opinion
the
proper
procedure
was
followed
here
by
the
parties
all
the
way,
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
was
made
by
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court
which
brought
into
play
the
provisions
of
rule
50
(a)
and
(b),
a
motion
for
this
motion
was
denied
which
of
course
reserved
that
the
rulings
on
the
issues
of
law
to
a
later
point,
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
were
made
by
the
defendant
at
the
trial
court
level.
both
of
these
motions
were
ruled
on,
both
of
them
were
denied
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes.
it
was
a
two-paragraph
motion
in
the
alternative
one
or
the
other.
mr.
john
c.
mott
in
both
of
those
were
ruled
on
which
satisfies
prior
decision
of
this
case
that
both
of
them
have
to
be
ruled
on.
i
think
the
duncan
case
is
the
one
that
says
that.
i
think
that
at
that
point
then
it
was
for
the
court
of
appeals
on
--
to
determine
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
which
it
did
at
no
point
in
the
trial
court
during
the
process
of
the
filing
and
the
hearing
of
these
motions
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
trial
court
seek
any
relief
other
than
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
she
didn't
make
any
statement
as
to
any
grounds
she
might
have
for
a
new
trial.
she
didn't
make
any
statement
with
regard
to
possible
dismissal
of
the
case,
should
the
motions
should
be
granted.
i
submit
that
when
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
denied,
this
enabled
under
the
judicial
code
and
under
the
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
to
finally
determine
the
case
and
i
submit
that
if
rule
50
(d)
means
that
every
time
a
case
is
reserved
the
district
court
has
the
right
to
grant
or
deny
a
new
trial.
these
matters
would
never
end.
the
case
would
be
reversed
that
trial
court
grant
a
new
trial
be
tried
it
all
over
again
in
this
procedure
could
theoretically
go
on
for
an
extended
period
of
time
and
certainly
would
not
produce
the
ends
that
we
desire
from
our
system
of
justice.
and
i
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
actions
and
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
john
c.
mott
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
i
believe
there
are
three
issues
that
are
before
this
court
of
this
time.
first
issue
being
does
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
power
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case
namely
to
reverse
and
remand
for
dismissal
and
as
counsel
brings
it
out
in
his
brief
that
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
seventh
amendment.
the
second,
if
it
please
the
court
is,
was
the
exercise
of
this
power
by
the
court
of
the
appeals
properly
requested
by
the
parties
and
i
submit
that
the
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
cone
case
and
globe
case
and
the
johnson
case.
and
the
third,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
third
question
was
the
petitioner,
the
plaintiff
and
the
trial
court
deprived
of
any
right
to
seek
a
new
trial
by
virtue
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
that
i
submit
and
it
requires
an
interpretation
of
rule
50
(d).
now,
on
broad
outline
i
answer
these
three
questions,
first
that
the
court
of
appeals
definitely
does
have
the
power
to
do
what
it
did
by
virtue
of
the
judicial
code
which
we
cited
in
the
brief
and
also
under
the
rule.
i
also
submit
that
the
exercise
of
this
power
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
properly
requested
and
lastly,
i
say
that
the
petitioner
was
not
deprived
of
any
right
to
seek
a
new
trial
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
alright
sir.
i'll
try
to
answer
that
in
the
best
way
i
can.
mr.
john
c.
mott
the
case
is
which
the
court
requested
us
to
look
into
and
brief
the
cone
case,
gold
and
weade
as
i
read
them
were
decided
before
the
adoption
of
rule
50
(d).
mr.
john
c.
mott
(d).
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes.
mr.
john
c.
mott
now,
in
each
on
of
those
cases,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court
after
an
adverse
jury
verdict
was
received
moved
for
a
new
trial.
in
the
johnson
case,
they
moved
to
set
aside
the
judgment
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
in
each
of
those
three
cases
they
did
not
move
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
this
court
held
in
each
one
of
those
cases
that
because
no
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
made
before
the
trial
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
on
appeal
did
not
have
the
power
to
reverse
and
dismiss.
now,
my
interpretation,
in
my
humble
opinion,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
those
three
cases
is
that
the
correlative
must
be
true
of
that
proposition
namely
that
if
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
is
requested
at
the
trial
court
level
then
the
court
of
appeal
does
have
the
power
to
reverse
and
dismiss.
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
i
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
judicial
code
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
and
which
we
quote
the
verbatim
clearly
authorizes
what
the
circuit
court
did
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
his
case.
mr.
john
c.
mott
now,
on
page
three
of
my
answer
brief,
i
think
it's
also
in
the
brief
on
the
--
in
our
position
to
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
the
supreme
court
or
any
other
court
of
appellate
jurisdiction
may
affirm
modify,
vacate,
set
aside,
or
reverse
any
judgment,
decree
or
order
of
court
lawfully
brought
before
review
and
may
remand
the
cause
and
direct
the
entry
of
such
appropriate
judgment
decree
or
order
or
require
such
further
proceedings
to
be
had
as
maybe
just
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
this
--
on
the
cone?
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
as
i
understand
it
cone
was
decided
in
1946
in
the
code
that
i
have
referred
to
was
decided
or
was
enacted
in
1948.
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
it's
a
provision.
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
now,
my
interpretation
to
that
and
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
be
facetious
in
this
at
all
mr.
justice
black
is
this,
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
basic
right
under
the
judicial
code
as
it's
always
had
to
reverse
and
affirm,
modify,
vacate
and
so
forth.
before
rule
50
(d)
was
adopted,
we
had
rule
50
(c)
which
stated
that
if
a
case
is
reversed
on
appeal
that
--
well,
no
rule
50
(c)
said,
that
if
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
granted
below
then
the
trial
court
could
entertain
the
motion
for
new
trial
10
days
thereafter.
then,
we
come
along
with
rule
50
(d)
which
in
my
opinion
if
it
please
the
court
is
not
a
rule
from
which
the
court
of
appeals
obtains
the
raw
power
to
do
what
it
did
but
is
merely
permissive
insofar
is
the
court
of
appeals
is
concern.
in
other
words,
as
i
read
it,
it
says
that
in
addition
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
right
to
do
generally
under
rule
50
(d)
nothing
prohibits
the
court
of
appeals
from
granting
a
new
trial
if
it's
so
desire.
in
other
words,
i
take
that
is
not
the
words
of
restriction
insofar
as
the
court
of
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
i
think
that's
inherent
and
it
does
not
say
the
specific
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
sir?
mr.
john
c.
mott
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
my
explanation
to
that
mr.
justice
black
is
this,
that
if
we
take
the
two
rules
(c)
and
(d)
to
get
which
we
must
in
this
case
because
they
were
both
enforced
when
this
case
was
tried.
rule
50
(c)
takes
the
situation
where
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
is
denied
--
is
granted.
in
that
case,
if
the
loser
in
that
case
is
the
verdict
winner
wants
a
new
trial
then
he
has
under
that
rule
the
right
as
well
as
the
responsibility
of
asking
the
trial
court
for
the
new
trial
10
days
after
the
judgment
of
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
if
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
is
denied
as
it
was
in
this
case
so
long
with
the
motion
for
new
trial
if
it
is
denied
as
i
read
rule
50
(d),
it
says
that
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
verdict
winner
to
seek
a
new
trial
must
be
as
“appellee”
and
although
they
don't
say
“appellee”
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
think
we
can
assume
that
that
is
the
only
court
in
which
in
the
federal
system
and
which
a
party
is
called
an
“appellee.”
so,
they
say
as
“appellee”
he
may
urge
grounds
on
which
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
in
other
words,
if
you
win
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
you
have
to
seek
your
new
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
rule
50
(d).
if
you
lose
the
motion
for
not
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
you
can
request
new
trial
under
rule
50
(c)
from
the
district
court.
then
the
rule
goes
on
to
say
if
it
please
the
court
that
nothing
in
rule
50
(d)
shall
be
denied
the
court
of
appeals
the
right
to
grant
a
new
trial
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
but
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
i
have.
mr.
john
c.
mott
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
in
rule
50
(d),
i
think
it
says
that
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
(voice
overlap)
it
says
nothing.
to
me,
if
it
says
that
nothing
prohibits
the
court
of
appeals
the
right
to
grant
a
new
trial.
i
don't
think
that
that
insinuates
the
court
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
certainly
there
was.
it
all
goes
back
to
the
old
proposition
that
grew
up
for
many
years
ago
with
regard
to
the
questions
of
law
being
purports
to
determine
and
questions
of
fact
for
juries.
of
course
the
--
no
one
has
ever
challenged
the
power
of
the
trial
court
to
decide
a
case
on
questions
of
law
and
direct
the
verdict
to
dismiss
the
case
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
c.
mott
then
they
used
the
device
of
reversing
that
position
until
after
the
trial
was
had
so
they
could
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes
sir.
in
slocum
or
redman
it
said
that
that
question
having
been
reserved
by
the
district
court
could
then
be
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
then
we
came
along
of
course
to
rule
50
which
deal
way
with
the
necessity
of
a
specific
reservation
of
that
right
and
said
that
every
time
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
was
made
in
the
trial
court
under
rule
50
(d)
or
rule
50
(d).
the
questions
of
law
are
preserved.
in
my
interpretation
is
that
those
questions
of
law
which
are
reserved
under
rule
50
(d)
can
be
determined
on
appeal
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
i
don't
think
it
is
in
rule
50
(d).
oh,
rule
50
(d)
as
i
read
it
says
that
nothing
prohibits
the
court
from
granting
a
new
trial
of
a
court
of
appeals
from
granting
a
new
trial
if
he
wants
to.
mr.
john
c.
mott
not
specifically
however
in
the
duncan
case,
montgomery
ward
versus
duncan
in
which
rule
50
was
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
as
i
read
the
cone
case
the
fatal
defect
that
occurred
in
that
case
at
the
trial
court
level
was
the
failure
of
the
defendant
in
that
case
to
move
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
that
isn't
the
way
i
read
the
duncan
case,
sir.
they're
saying
in
the
duncan
case
they
say
that
if
motion
for
new
trial
is
made
if
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
is
made
at
the
trial
court
level
if
both
motions
are
denied
then
the
court
of
appeals
can
reverse
and
dismiss
without
to
say
reverse
and
dismiss.
it
says
it
can
decide
the
questions
of
law
and
i
submit
that's
exactly
what
was
done
in
this
case
that
what
the
circuit
court
of
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
was
to
decide
the
questions
of
law
which
were
improperly
decided
below.
and
as
far
as
the
cone
case
is
concern
my
view
of
that
case
is
that
it
says
that
because
no
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
made
below
the
appellant
in
the
court
of
appeals
actually
had
no
right
to
ask
that
court
for
a
reversal
and
you
can't
have
something
that
you're
not
--
you
don't
ask
for
and
that
was
the
basis
as
i
read
the
case
on
which
the
decision
rested.
now,
there
was
comment
on
the
cone
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
the
effect
that
in
the
trial
court
if
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
made
and
if
it
look
like
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
case
that
the
motion
was
going
to
be
granted
he
would
have
the
right
under
rule
41
to
ask
for
a
voluntary
dismissal
of
the
case
and
start
over
or
he
might
have
saw
the
handwriting
on
the
wall
and
ask
for
a
new
trial.
well,
and
in
that
case
as
i
read
it,
the
fact
the
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
not
asked
for
in
the
trial
court
may
have
in
that
particular
case
deprive
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
to
ask
for
something
he
otherwise
might've
asked
for.
but
i
submit
under
rule
50
(d)
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
not
been
denied
the
right
to
seek
a
new
trial
that
she
neglected
to
seek
a
new
trial
under
rule
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
i
say
that
under
the
judicial
code
the
power
is
there
and
also
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
merely
because
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
not
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
in
cone?
mr.
john
c.
mott
in
the
cone
case.
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
i'm
in
a
peculiar
position,
if
it
please
your
honor,
i
know
you
wrote
the
decision
and
certainly
you
should
know
more
about
it
than
i
or
anyone
else
in
this
room
but
to
me
i
didn't
ever
read
in
the
cone
case
any
prohibition
on
the
general
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes
sir,
i
did.
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
it
said
that
before
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
trial
court's
thinking
as
to
whether
a
new
trial
or
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
should
be
granted.
and
that
that
would
be
helpful
but
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
maybe
i'm
not
using
absolutely
the
correct
term
there
but
at
that
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
i
think
that's
a
better
word
but
it
didn't
say
that
the
power
was
unfair
and
that's
what
i
think
we
disagree.
sir?
mr.
john
c.
mott
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
the
power
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
well,
as
i
read
it,
it
said
that
because
the
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
not
requested
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
power
to
grant
such
relief.
in
other
words,
you
can't
have
something
you
don't
ask
for
and
that's
what
i
submit
is
the
situation
with
the
plaintiff
here
in
--
with
regard
to
rule
50
(d)
that
she
didn't
ask
for
a
new
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
therefore
she
can't
complain
that
she
wasn't
granted
that
relief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
would
like
to
conclude
that
in
my
opinion
the
proper
procedure
was
followed
here
by
the
parties
all
the
way,
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
was
made
by
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court
which
brought
into
play
the
provisions
of
rule
50
(a)
and
(b),
a
motion
for
this
motion
was
denied
which
of
course
reserved
that
the
rulings
on
the
issues
of
law
to
a
later
point,
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
were
made
by
the
defendant
at
the
trial
court
level.
both
of
these
motions
were
ruled
on,
both
of
them
were
denied
--
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
mott
yes.
it
was
a
two-paragraph
motion
in
the
alternative
one
or
the
other.
mr.
john
c.
mott
in
both
of
those
were
ruled
on
which
satisfies
prior
decision
of
this
case
that
both
of
them
have
to
be
ruled
on.
i
think
the
duncan
case
is
the
one
that
says
that.
i
think
that
at
that
point
then
it
was
for
the
court
of
appeals
on
--
to
determine
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
which
it
did
at
no
point
in
the
trial
court
during
the
process
of
the
filing
and
the
hearing
of
these
motions
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
trial
court
seek
any
relief
other
than
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
she
didn't
make
any
statement
as
to
any
grounds
she
might
have
for
a
new
trial.
she
didn't
make
any
statement
with
regard
to
possible
dismissal
of
the
case,
should
the
motions
should
be
granted.
i
submit
that
when
the
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
was
denied,
this
enabled
under
the
judicial
code
and
under
the
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
to
finally
determine
the
case
and
i
submit
that
if
rule
50
(d)
means
that
every
time
a
case
is
reserved
the
district
court
has
the
right
to
grant
or
deny
a
new
trial.
these
matters
would
never
end.
the
case
would
be
reversed
that
trial
court
grant
a
new
trial
be
tried
it
all
over
again
in
this
procedure
could
theoretically
go
on
for
an
extended
period
of
time
and
certainly
would
not
produce
the
ends
that
we
desire
from
our
system
of
justice.
and
i
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
actions
and
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
