that
in
addition
to
all
the
others.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kripke,
could
i
ask
a
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
a
defendant
who've
lost
in
a
trial
court
makes
a
motion
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
right.
well,
if
you
won
and
mr.
mott
makes
a
motion
to
--
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
and
apparently
a
motion
for
new
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
trial
court
then
grants
the
motion
notwithstanding
the
verdict
and
then
you're
under
50
(c)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
he
also
passes
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
he
conditionally
grants
it
if
the
ruling
on
the
motion
for
verdict
is
reversed.
he
conditionally
grants
it.
now
the
appellate
court
reverses
his
ruling
on
the
judgment
before
on
the
n.o.v.,
may
the
appellate
court,
in
your
opinion,
under
any
of
your
argument
then
reverse
the
grant
of
the
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
rule
says,
expressly
says
it
can.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
granted?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
event
this
person
judgment
is
overturned.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
blame
you
for
not
getting
to
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
expressly
gives
the
court
of
appeals
power
to
reverse
the
trial
judge
in
this
we
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
it
say
so
expressly?
where
did
they
get
that
power?
where's
the
court
of
appeals
get
that
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
now
let
me
say
that
they
grant
the
motion
for
a
motion
n.o.v.
in
the
trial
court
and
conditionally
rule
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
by
denying
it
but
it
is
reversed.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
the
appellate
court
then
reverse
the
ruling
on
motion
for
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
what
if
the
appellant
on
that
basis
you
ought
to
say
that
the
appellate
court
can
never
reverse
the
trial
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
as
long
as
it
get
–-
it
first
has
what
the
trial
judge
has
to
say
about
the
motion
then
it
can
go
either
way
as
long
as
the
trial
judge
has
proved
he
really
does
know
what
he's
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
can
reverse
it,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
with
the
motion
for
new
trial,
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
that
got
--
that's
related
to
the
n.o.v.
motion
not
the
motion
for
new
trial?
well,
anyway
you
don't
think
they
reached
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.

the
