mr.
solomon
a.
klein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
i
don't
think
that
any
lawyer
should
ever
be
required
to
crawl.
and
this
associate
at
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
disbarred
the
petition
because
he
refused
to
cooperate
by
relinquishing
a
valid
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
with
all
duel
deference
to
my
adversary
contrary,
to
the
record
facts
as
well
as
to
the
actual
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
now
may
i
say,
i
happen
to
be
one
who
agrees
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
is
one
of
the
great
landmarks
of
my
struggle
to
make
himself
civilized.
that's
dean
--
agree
with
those
of
dean
griswold's
words
that
have
been
quoted
in
opinions
in
this
court.
at
the
same
time,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
on
the
facts
in
this
case
and
on
the
judgment
rendered
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
not
to
your
opinion
written
by
that
appellate
division
that
the
petitioner's
position
amongst
to
nothing
more
than
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
can
be
stretched
to
a
point
of
frustrating
an
equally
important
obligation
on
the
part
of
all
government
to
provide
equal
justice
under
law,
equal
justice
to
the
poor
as
well
as
to
the
rich.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
state
of
new
york
and
of
the
states
but
particularly
the
state
of
new
york
has
for
years
been
confronted
with
a
difficult
problem.
namely,
to
try
to
control
the
evils
that
haven't
--
as
a
result
of
experience
are
risen
from
the
contingent
fee
negligence
practice.
there
was
a
time
when
new
york
prohibited
contingent
fees
as
well
as
other
states
in
u.s.
inland
and
other
foreign
countries
prohibited
today.
the
theory
behind
such
prohibition
is
that
the
contingent
fee
introduces
a
speculative
element
which
leads
to
or
stirring
up
the
litigation
in
passing
the
obligation,
the
duty
that
a
lawyer
has
to
a
client.
it
has
cost
what
it
almost
a
national
disgrace
namely
the
overcrowding
of
our
calendars
of
federal
and
state
courts
where
litigation
that
doesn't
belong
there
because
it
is
not
merit.
but
recognizing
those
evils
is
one
important
justification
for
permitting
the
contingent
fee
practice.
and
it
is
the
only
justification
for
it
namely,
to
put
our
courts
of
justice
within
the
reach
of
the
accident
victims
of
which
there
are
many
in
our
highly
industrialized
mechanized
society
today,
to
put
those
courts
of
justice
within
the
reach
of
those
accident
victims
all
because
of
financial
inability
even
though
they
have
a
meritorious
cause
of
action,
cannot
afford
to
pay
a
fixed
fee
for
representation
by
competent
counsel.
it
is
that
important
consideration
that
has
induced
new
york
and
other
states
of
our
human
to
permit
the
contingent
fee
and
to
provide
for
necessary
rules
and
regulations
so
as
to
prevent
these
evils
from
arising.
and
what
has
new
york
done?
for
many
years,
not
yesterday
goes
back
to
at
least
1940,
after
some
very
bad
experience
starting
in
1928
that
established
special
rules
that
are
very
simple.
the
first
is
that
every
attorney
engaged
in
contingent
fee
negligence
practice
must
file
with
the
appellate
division.
today
it's
with
the
judicial
conference
of
the
state
of
new
york,
a
statement
of
retainer
in
which
he
is
to
disclose
the
terms
of
this
contingent
fee
compensation.
the
name
of
the
client
and
the
source
of
the
retainer
and
he's
required
to
keep
a
special
account
into
which
he
must
deposit
all
recoveries
that
he
obtains
on
behalf
of
his
injured
clients.
he
is
prohibited
from
commingling
those
funds.
he
is
prohibited
from
withdrawing
his
share
before
he
pays
that
injured
client.
he
is
required
to
give
a
closing
statement
to
the
injured
client
setting
forth
how
much
he
recovered.
what
his
fee
is
and
what
the
disbursement
was?
and
then,
he
is
required
by
special
rule
to
preserve
his
records
of
a
disposition
of
those
cases
for
a
period
of
five
years.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
the
records
would
include
and
if
your
honor
would
look
at
the
present
rule,
that
prior
rule
said,
“all
dated
memorandum
with
respect
to
the
disposition
thereof
and
that
must
be
read
in
connection
with
the
prior
rule
particularly
rule
4
which
requires
him
to
keep
a
special
account
and
to
deposit
all
recoveries
in
that
special
account.
and
your
honor
will
find
that
the
rule
today
invoke
the
first
and
the
second
judicial
deposits
make
it
unmistakably
clear
that
it
includes
canceled
checks,
vouchers,
things
of
that
kind.
now
let
me
say
these
things,
your
honors.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
he
should
pres
--
well,
case
files
should
also
preserve.
yes,
because
the
case
files
would
contain
for
example,
copies
of
the
closing
statements
that
he
gave
to
the
client
or
may
contain
other
information.
it
should
preserve
them
for
a
period
of
five
years.
under
new
york
court
of
appeals,
rule
in
this
case
that
the
records
required
to
be
checked
under
rule
5
come
within
the
required
records
doctrine
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
shapiro
case
and
may
i
say,
we
all
have
the
highest
regard
for
the
great
constitutional
decision
in
boyd
against
united
states.
one
of
the
greatest,
giving
the
most
broad,
liberal
interpretation
to
both
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
and
in
that
very
case
as
i
indicate
in
my
brief,
i
believe.
unfortunately,
the
footnote
i
think.
mr.
justice
bradley
after
giving
the
broadest
interpretation
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
specifically
for
it
says,
that
that
does
not
apply
to
records
required
to
be
kept
by
law.
i
will
return
to
that
in
that
moment
your
honors.
i'm
watching
my
time.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
one
of
the
problems
of
new
york
and
other
states
is
the
danger
that
the
hospital
attendant,
the
policeman,
the
insurance
agent,
the
boss
of
the
waterfront,
the
insurance
company
adjuster,
and
others
may
share
at
the
danger
in
the
recoveries
made
on
behalf
of
injured
clients
who
are
laymen
sufferings
from
severe
injuries
and
do
not
know
what
their
rights
are.
that
is
the
danger
we
were
to
provide
against
in
addition
to
destroy
both
federal
as
well
as
state
courts
by
plugging
them
with
unjustifiable
causes
of
action.
now
how
can
we
do
it?
by
adding
this
requirement
that
he
preserved
those
records,
we
then
have
the
necessary
information
whether
or
not
for
example.
he
has
deposited
the
funds
are
recovered
on
behalf
on
his
clients
in
a
special
account
or
they
speculated
to
those
funds
for
his
personal
profit
and
then
even
though
he
pays
the
client,
keeps
to
properly
made,
or
if
he
should
lose
in
his
speculation,
the
client
suffers.
there
is
no
other
source
that
we
content
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
abided
by
the
special
rules
particularly,
the
deposit
you
see
may
of
the
monies
he
recovered
on
behalf
of
his
clients.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
will
say
my
judgment,
it
goes
beyond.
in
several
instances,
we
are
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
there's
room
for
reasonable
argument
that
some
of
the
items
called
for
in
this
appeal.
it
might
perhaps
they
argued
do
not
come
within
the
require
records
of
i'm
talking
here.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
but
let
me
emphasize
your
honor
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
oh,
those
are
i
would
say
do
not
come.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
or
i
could
give
it
the
other
way.
now,
i
submit
sir
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
at
page
1
of
the
records
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
--
of
the
transcript,
the
printed
transcript
of
the
record,
cash
disbursements
book.
now
your
honors,
payments
too
are
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
would
say
do
come
within
the
records.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
i
would
exclude
and
i
have
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
would
exclude
as
not
coming
within
the
statute.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
the
federal
and
state
tax
returns
for
example.
in
fact
your
honors,
may
i
say
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
--
that
the
past
two
years
that
i
have
been
the
counsel
to
the
judicial
inquiry
must
have
been
expressly,
i
limit,
i
omit
calling
of
federal
state
tax
returns
because
i
do
not
deem
it
to
be
within
my
province
to
become
an
adjunct
of
either
the
federal
internal
revenue
or
the
state
tax.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
worksheets
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
item
12.
copy
the
federal
state
income
tax
returns,
accountant's
worksheets,
and
all
other
--
i
do
not
include
as
declare.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
but
may
i
ask.
that
the
others
are
all
related
through
the
essential
enforcement
of
the
special
rules.
these
payments
that
other
lawyers
have
made
to
runners,
hospital
attendants,
policemen
and
others
are
generally
charged
as
necessary
disbursements
which
come
out
of
the
claimed
share.
it
is
that
that
we
would
like
to
find
out
whether
the
clients
monies
are
being
used
for
alleged
necessary
disbursements
when
in
fact
may
be
a
pay
off
to
an
insurance
adjustment.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
number
10.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
records
of
all
those
made
from
financial
institutions
and
others
open
and
close
as
that
does
have
a
relevancy
in
this
sense.
whether
he
is
borrowing
money
in
order
to
finance
the
contingent
fee
litigation,
well,
i
do
not
think
it's
of
any
grave
importance
as
to
those
records.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
the
specific
statute
is
in
broad
language
and
as
it
reached
today
and
may
i
add
that
in
1900,
in
july
1960
which
was
before
the
petitioner
in
this
case
ultimately
claimed
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
i
will
--
i
must
come
to
that.
the
new
york
--
the
first
department,
television
and
second
departments,
expressly
provide
that
it
shall
include
all
memoranda
data
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
the
--
and
there
pursuant
to
section
90
of
the
judiciary
law
and
are
equivalent
to
statutes
include
cash
and
checks,
vouchers,
all
financial
data
of
that
kind
that
would
be
related
to
the
important
questions
as
to
what
he
did
with
these
trust
matters.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
this
in
view
of
your
honor's
question.
when
the
petitioner
ultimately
asserted
his
refusals,
each
item
in
the
subpoena
this
is
taken.
he
was
asked
about
separately.
he
refused
to
produced
any
want
so
that
if
i
assume
from
the
second
discussion
that
some
of
them
might
not
be
included
within
the
required
records
doctrine,
the
important
finding,
i
won't
anything
but
i
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
what
was
that?
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
the
ground
was
claimed
of
constitution
of
privilege
fifth
amendment.
and
may
i
add
that
in
the
course,
he
also
announced
and
i
won't
answer
any
question
in
relation
thereto.
a
blanket
would
use
to
give
any
and
all
testimonies.
and
when
your
honors,
they
have
already
looked
at
it.
but
when
you
do,
the
amended
(inaudible)
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
makes
that
unmistakably
clear
that
the
two
grounds
upon
which
they
urged
that
he
had
been
denied
his
constitutional
rights,
well,
one
that
he
had
a
right
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
refuse
to
produce
anyone
of
the
records
and
that
the
had
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
and
i'm
quoting
any
question
which
might
be
asked.
now
may
i
ask,
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
no.
there
is
no
immunity
was
promised.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
what
would
be
the
crimes?
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
there's
a
possible
belief
he
paid
the
lay
referral
money
for
the
foreign
cases
to
it.
he
was
thereby
being
aiding
in
embezzlement
a
layman
in
the
practice
of
law
which
is
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
--
criminal
under
new
york
inmate.
as
certainly
it
protects,
he
converted
the
client's
recoveries
for
his
personal
used
that
would
be
lost
in.
so
that
those
are
only
--
was
the
two
possibilities.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
there's
a
possibility,
in
fact,
in
the
record
he
said,
that
there
might
be
tax
problems.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
he
did.
at
one
time
in
the
record,
he
said
that
may
be
tax
problems.
but
my
point
is
this
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i'm
glad
your
honor
you
asked
that
question.
this
period
--
the
period
of
time
covered
in
this.
i
think
it
is
1958,
june
of
1958
until
january
1962,
that's
the
third
at
that
time.
and
at
that
time
the
lawyer
didn't
tell
me
have
not
yet
been
decided.
when
he
first
appeared
and
his
very
first
appearance
before
mr.
justice
arkwright
in
response
to
the
subpoena
this
was
taken.
he
was
asked
by
justice
arkwright,
“where
are
the
records
you
are
required
to
keep
under
rule
iv?”
i
mentioned
this
because
they
said
the
first
time
they
heard
anything
about
the
required
document
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
june
1958
of
the
day
of
his
first
appearance,
“where
are
the
records
that
you
are
required
to
keep
under
rule
iv?”
petitioner
said,
“sir,
the
courts
have
weigh
round
the
records.”
“you
are
required
to
keep
under
the
rule
4
which
is
the
rule
requiring
you
have
set
up
a
special
account.”
mr.
spevack:
“they
are
in
my
check
book.
i
refuse
to
produce
these
checkbooks
or
as
canceled
checks.”
and
then
he
had
taken
the
journal.
and
i
come
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question.
it
was
told
only
warrant
of
the
records.
he
then
instituted
a
separate
proceeding
to
quash
this
thing
raising
constitutional
grounds
and
the
case
came
up
to
here.
up
to
this
court,
they
are
always
denied
certiorari.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that
is
right,
sir.
it
is
that
very
subpoena
that
he
attack
by
independent
proceeding
and
went
through
the
state
court
is
not
--
the
application
to
quash
was
denied.
well,
he
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
before
this
court
and
it
was
denied
and
then
he
came
back
through
the
judicial
inquire
and
then
for
the
first
time
then
he
asserted
not
to
comment
on
that.
he
asserted
state
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
due
process,
fundamental
premise
requirement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
and
before
cohen
v.
hurley.
and
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
baker
the
presiding
justice
did
express
the
opinions
likely
to
having
like
to
claim
the
privilege.
but
this
is
serious
question
and
we're
having
a
test
case
coming
up
so
we
will
give
you
an
adjournment.
we'll
wait
till
the
outcome
of
the
test
case
and
then
we'll
give
you
an
opportunity
to
come
by.
now
the
test
case
is
cohen
v.
hurley
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this
point
because
i
have
kept
in
right
in
saying
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
and
there's
one
important
point
as
i
see
it.
cohen
v.
hurley
did
not
deal
where
there
were
five
records
doctrine
at
all
and
as
shown
by
the
majority
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
cohen
case
turned
on
points
refusing
to
answer
some
60
questions.
the
answers
to
which
he
claimed
would
tend
to
incriminate
and
i
check
the
record.
cohen
didn't
refuse
as
or
any
at
all
questions.
on
the
contrary
he
answered
some
but
a
certain
privilege
only
as
to
those
where
the
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate.
and
mr.
justice
black
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
in
footnote
3
pointed
out,
quite
clearly
that
because
the
cohen
case
“hinged”
i'm
quoting
when
i
use
the
word
“hinged”,
on
the
refusal
of
mr.
cohen
to
answer
questions
that
had
been
asked.
mr.
justice
black
put
the
point
of
view
that
his
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated.
now,
we
have
just
the
opposite
kind
of
case
here.
i
say
the
dominant
controlling
fact
from
the
first
hearing
on
june
12,
1958
until
the
last
hearing
in
january
1962.
the
only
thing
that
kept
the
man,
all
we
want
are
the
records.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
oh,
no.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
but
because
the
subpoena
at
the
very
top
says,
“in
connection
with
your
business
as
an
attorney”
and
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
oh!
on
the
contrary,
i
would
like
to
put
it
this
way.
the
petitioner
here
pursuant
to
the
special
rules
filed
with
the
appellate
division
in
a
period
of
seven
and
a
half
years,
1,062
returning
statements
at
over
a
140
cases
a
year.
it
was
in
connection
with
that
business
as
a
single
practitioner
that
we
--
he
was
served
with
this
subpoena
to
produce
records
pertaining
to
his
business
as
an
attorney.
that's
the
only
business
he
has.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
i
should
think
that
anyone
hearing
the
(inaudible)
40
cases
a
year
is
pretty
well
occupied.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
he
could
very
easily
your
honor.
say,
i
produce
this
which
relate
to
my
business
as
an
attorney
and
do
not
produce
those
that
are
purely
private.
may
i
add
that
it
is
in
the
record
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
he
was
charged
with
refusal
to
produce
records
he
was
required
to
keep
it.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
he
was
barred
because
of
that
ground.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
may
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
his
statement,
the
petitioner's
statement,
of
the
record
at
page
31
to
32,
when
he
first
claimed
privilege
and
the
court
said,
“you
better
state
it
again.
the
subpoena
calls
for
the
production
of
the
books.
they
have
not
been
produced.”
the
witness:
“whatever
records,
your
honor,
that
were
available
to
me,
i
could
physically
if
i
have
obtained
the
time.
get
them
together
and
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
at
record
pages
31-32.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
in
this
record.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
at
the
bottom
of
page
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
“i
could
them
together
on
the
package
and
in
bundle
and
bring
them
here
along
side
to
me,
therefore,
if
i
may
say
the
matter
of
producing
production
of
the
records
are
all
having
them
here
physically
is
not
an
issue.”
court
said,
“alright,
bring
that
up
now.”
and
his
attorney
says,
“thank
you.”
and
the
witness
said,
“that
the
only
matter
in
issue
is
the
refusal
to
turn
them
over.
it
is
quite
clear
as
i
see
it
that
the
position
of
the
petitioner
was
that
he
won't
produce
anyone
of
the
records.”
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
i'm
not
saying
here.
although,
i
express
the
opinion
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
--
perhaps
i
will
express
the
opinion
on
broad
side
and
no
right
to
lose
some.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said,
didn't
distinguish,
they
make
a
distinction
as
i
drew
among
with
regard.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
speaking
for
the
state
of
new
york
say,
these
are
the
required
records.
i
merely
indicated
of
what
my
practice
is
since
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
no
--
no
it
wouldn't.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
because
if
the
other
records
--
they
have
not
to
come
within
the
require
record
is
not
true.
he
would
have
the
privilege
as
to
that,
but
he
has
no
privilege.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
feel
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
--
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that.
it's
an
argument
that
could
be
made.
but
i
would
disagree
with
this
reason.
but
under
the
doctrine
of
shapiro
against
u.s.,
he
has
a
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
as
to
records
that
are
required
to
be
kept.
he
does
have
fifth
amendment
privilege
as
to
records,
he
is
not
required
and
also
as
to
the
refuse
to
answer
--
give
all
testimony
that
may
tend
to
incriminate.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
hope
i
answer
that.
your
honors,
we
--
in
the
performance
of
our
duties.
we
don't
want
to
deprive
anyone
lawyer
or
not
lawyer
of
his
constitutional
rights
but
i
say
that
a
lawyer
is
entitled
to
the
same
constitutional
rights
as
mr.
malloy
the
gambler
and
malloy
against
hogan,
and
as
mr.
shapiro,
the
wholesale
fruit
dealer
in
the
shapiro
case.
but
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
greater
rights
and
that
is
precisely
the
effect
or
the
position
taken.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
my
position
would
be
that
he
could
not.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
and
i
may
say,
i
think
that
that
is
the
position
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
since
malloy.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that
is
correct.
now,
i
said
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
oh!
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
cohen
v.
hurley
is
overruled.
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
this
case,
may
i
put
it
this
way.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
upon
the
party
of
cohen
v.
hurley
and
upon
the
further
ground
that
a
demand
not
the
oral
testimony
but
for
records
required
to
be
kept
by
law
do
not
come
within
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
now
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
coupled
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
here
is
the
holding
in
this
case.
mainly,
that
it
is
not
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
or
fundamental
fairness
which
is
cohen
v.
hurley,
to
disbar
an
attorney
who
refuses
to
produce
unprivileged
records.
that
is
the
holding
in
this
case
whether
or
not
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
malloy
v.
hogan.
the
cohen
v.
hurley
case
dealing
solely
with
a
refusal
to
answer
question
that
my
time
to
incriminate
is
overruled
i
cannot
not
assume
that
authority.
i've
answered
mr.
justice
brennan
on
this
to
what
my
own
point
of
view
is
because
i
happen
to
believe
that
no
lawyr
bunch
of
case
that
make
him
can
be
deprive
of
a
constitutional
right
and
merely
because
are
all
required
to
relinquish.
put
it
that
way
because
that's
the
way
they
brief
repeats
it
to
relinquish
a
constitutional
right
in
order
to
hold
on
to
a
job
or
to
be
a
lawyer.
that's
my
personal
point
of
view
but
i
do
not
speak
for
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
case,
i
submit
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
fully
aware
of
this
court's
mandate
under
malloy
v.
hogan
that
we
must
follow
the
federal
standard
did
precisely
that.
and
now,
my
learned
adversary
is
asking
to
this
court
really
to
say
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
“mr.
court
of
appeals,
you
had
no
business
following
our
standard
as
enunciated
in
shapiro
and
other
cases.
there
are
others,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
a
good
one
where
federal
statutes
are
involved.”
i
submit
sir,
i
would
add
this.
this
emphasis
on
the
language
selected
from
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
is
on
warrant
and
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
its
no
--
i
don't
mean
any
disrespect
to
this
court
for
me
to
say
that
your
honors
do
not
seek
to
revise
the
opinions
of
an
intermediate
cause
of
the
states.
it
is
only
to
correct
judgments
involving
federal
questions
rendered
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
submit
sirs,
that
on
the
judgment
here
and
on
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner
or
no
way
violated.
and
i
submit
that
is
evident
to
be
held
otherwise
then
not
only
new
york
but
every
state
in
the
union
would
simply
be
frustrated
in
any
reasonable
efforts
to
control
the
abuses
in
contingent
fee
negligence
practice.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
the
rational
as
i
understand
is
this,
that
where
anyone
lawyer
or
anyone
else
engages
in
any
activity
which
is
subject
to
government
regulation
in
there.
government
has
a
strong
social-economic
interest
that
in
order
to
enforce
those
regulations.
records
must
be
kept
then
such
records
do
not
come
within
the
reach
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
i
wouldn't
say
it
is
all
the
written.
i
would
rather
put
it
at
the
--
there's
never
intended
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
even
reach
that
type
of
situation.
i
don't
like
--
i
am
not
--
i
don't
think
it
cuts
down
the
fifth
amendment.
it's
that
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
reach
it.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that
--
well
that
is
the
effect
of
it.
i
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that
is
right.
and
i
suggest
sirs,
that
that
is
the
thought
expressed
by
mr.
justice
bradley.
it
was
carried
on
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
where
the
federal
government
steps
in,
in
order
to
protect
minimum
wages,
maximum
allowance,
requiring
those
engagements
to
state
commerce,
the
employers
to
keep
records
as
to
the
wages
paid
in
hours
work
in
order
to
protect
the
economy
our
country.
and
this
court,
the
case
is
cited
in
the
shapiro
case,
united
states
against
darby,
unanimously
upheld
that
kind
of
a
valid
regulation.
and
surely,
even
my
adversary
next
on
contention
that
the
special
rules
regulating
the
(inaudible)
of
attorneys
are
invalid.
one
further
thought
subject
to
any
further
questions.
here
is
a
lawyer
who
pursuant
to
the
rules
filed
statements
of
retainer,
gave
information,
profited
by
the
permission
granted
to
engage
in
extensive
contingent
fee
negligence
practice
and
after
he
did
so,
he
was
called
upon
to
account.
he
then
says,
“i
won't”.
and
he
won't
even
answer
any
question.
“i'm
not
aware
of
any
federal
case.
i
never
said
that
any
witnesses
distinguish
from
the
defendant;
reference
is
made
to
griffin
against
california
as
distinguished
from
the
defendant
that
any
witness
called
in
inquiry
where
no
charge
is
made
against
him
and
interpose
a
blanket
of
refusal
to
answer
any
questions
at
all.
as
far
as
i'm
aware
about
federal
and
state
law
agreed
that
he
has
no
such
right.
i
submit
sir
that
the
judgment
should
be
upheld.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
i
don't
think
that
any
lawyer
should
ever
be
required
to
crawl.
and
this
associate
at
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
disbarred
the
petition
because
he
refused
to
cooperate
by
relinquishing
a
valid
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
with
all
duel
deference
to
my
adversary
contrary,
to
the
record
facts
as
well
as
to
the
actual
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
now
may
i
say,
i
happen
to
be
one
who
agrees
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
is
one
of
the
great
landmarks
of
my
struggle
to
make
himself
civilized.
that's
dean
--
agree
with
those
of
dean
griswold's
words
that
have
been
quoted
in
opinions
in
this
court.
at
the
same
time,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
on
the
facts
in
this
case
and
on
the
judgment
rendered
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
not
to
your
opinion
written
by
that
appellate
division
that
the
petitioner's
position
amongst
to
nothing
more
than
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
can
be
stretched
to
a
point
of
frustrating
an
equally
important
obligation
on
the
part
of
all
government
to
provide
equal
justice
under
law,
equal
justice
to
the
poor
as
well
as
to
the
rich.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
state
of
new
york
and
of
the
states
but
particularly
the
state
of
new
york
has
for
years
been
confronted
with
a
difficult
problem.
namely,
to
try
to
control
the
evils
that
haven't
--
as
a
result
of
experience
are
risen
from
the
contingent
fee
negligence
practice.
there
was
a
time
when
new
york
prohibited
contingent
fees
as
well
as
other
states
in
u.s.
inland
and
other
foreign
countries
prohibited
today.
the
theory
behind
such
prohibition
is
that
the
contingent
fee
introduces
a
speculative
element
which
leads
to
or
stirring
up
the
litigation
in
passing
the
obligation,
the
duty
that
a
lawyer
has
to
a
client.
it
has
cost
what
it
almost
a
national
disgrace
namely
the
overcrowding
of
our
calendars
of
federal
and
state
courts
where
litigation
that
doesn't
belong
there
because
it
is
not
merit.
but
recognizing
those
evils
is
one
important
justification
for
permitting
the
contingent
fee
practice.
and
it
is
the
only
justification
for
it
namely,
to
put
our
courts
of
justice
within
the
reach
of
the
accident
victims
of
which
there
are
many
in
our
highly
industrialized
mechanized
society
today,
to
put
those
courts
of
justice
within
the
reach
of
those
accident
victims
all
because
of
financial
inability
even
though
they
have
a
meritorious
cause
of
action,
cannot
afford
to
pay
a
fixed
fee
for
representation
by
competent
counsel.
it
is
that
important
consideration
that
has
induced
new
york
and
other
states
of
our
human
to
permit
the
contingent
fee
and
to
provide
for
necessary
rules
and
regulations
so
as
to
prevent
these
evils
from
arising.
and
what
has
new
york
done?
for
many
years,
not
yesterday
goes
back
to
at
least
1940,
after
some
very
bad
experience
starting
in
1928
that
established
special
rules
that
are
very
simple.
the
first
is
that
every
attorney
engaged
in
contingent
fee
negligence
practice
must
file
with
the
appellate
division.
today
it's
with
the
judicial
conference
of
the
state
of
new
york,
a
statement
of
retainer
in
which
he
is
to
disclose
the
terms
of
this
contingent
fee
compensation.
the
name
of
the
client
and
the
source
of
the
retainer
and
he's
required
to
keep
a
special
account
into
which
he
must
deposit
all
recoveries
that
he
obtains
on
behalf
of
his
injured
clients.
he
is
prohibited
from
commingling
those
funds.
he
is
prohibited
from
withdrawing
his
share
before
he
pays
that
injured
client.
he
is
required
to
give
a
closing
statement
to
the
injured
client
setting
forth
how
much
he
recovered.
what
his
fee
is
and
what
the
disbursement
was?
and
then,
he
is
required
by
special
rule
to
preserve
his
records
of
a
disposition
of
those
cases
for
a
period
of
five
years.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
the
records
would
include
and
if
your
honor
would
look
at
the
present
rule,
that
prior
rule
said,
“all
dated
memorandum
with
respect
to
the
disposition
thereof
and
that
must
be
read
in
connection
with
the
prior
rule
particularly
rule
4
which
requires
him
to
keep
a
special
account
and
to
deposit
all
recoveries
in
that
special
account.
and
your
honor
will
find
that
the
rule
today
invoke
the
first
and
the
second
judicial
deposits
make
it
unmistakably
clear
that
it
includes
canceled
checks,
vouchers,
things
of
that
kind.
now
let
me
say
these
things,
your
honors.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
he
should
pres
--
well,
case
files
should
also
preserve.
yes,
because
the
case
files
would
contain
for
example,
copies
of
the
closing
statements
that
he
gave
to
the
client
or
may
contain
other
information.
it
should
preserve
them
for
a
period
of
five
years.
under
new
york
court
of
appeals,
rule
in
this
case
that
the
records
required
to
be
checked
under
rule
5
come
within
the
required
records
doctrine
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
shapiro
case
and
may
i
say,
we
all
have
the
highest
regard
for
the
great
constitutional
decision
in
boyd
against
united
states.
one
of
the
greatest,
giving
the
most
broad,
liberal
interpretation
to
both
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
and
in
that
very
case
as
i
indicate
in
my
brief,
i
believe.
unfortunately,
the
footnote
i
think.
mr.
justice
bradley
after
giving
the
broadest
interpretation
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
specifically
for
it
says,
that
that
does
not
apply
to
records
required
to
be
kept
by
law.
i
will
return
to
that
in
that
moment
your
honors.
i'm
watching
my
time.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
one
of
the
problems
of
new
york
and
other
states
is
the
danger
that
the
hospital
attendant,
the
policeman,
the
insurance
agent,
the
boss
of
the
waterfront,
the
insurance
company
adjuster,
and
others
may
share
at
the
danger
in
the
recoveries
made
on
behalf
of
injured
clients
who
are
laymen
sufferings
from
severe
injuries
and
do
not
know
what
their
rights
are.
that
is
the
danger
we
were
to
provide
against
in
addition
to
destroy
both
federal
as
well
as
state
courts
by
plugging
them
with
unjustifiable
causes
of
action.
now
how
can
we
do
it?
by
adding
this
requirement
that
he
preserved
those
records,
we
then
have
the
necessary
information
whether
or
not
for
example.
he
has
deposited
the
funds
are
recovered
on
behalf
on
his
clients
in
a
special
account
or
they
speculated
to
those
funds
for
his
personal
profit
and
then
even
though
he
pays
the
client,
keeps
to
properly
made,
or
if
he
should
lose
in
his
speculation,
the
client
suffers.
there
is
no
other
source
that
we
content
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
abided
by
the
special
rules
particularly,
the
deposit
you
see
may
of
the
monies
he
recovered
on
behalf
of
his
clients.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
will
say
my
judgment,
it
goes
beyond.
in
several
instances,
we
are
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
there's
room
for
reasonable
argument
that
some
of
the
items
called
for
in
this
appeal.
it
might
perhaps
they
argued
do
not
come
within
the
require
records
of
i'm
talking
here.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
but
let
me
emphasize
your
honor
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
oh,
those
are
i
would
say
do
not
come.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
or
i
could
give
it
the
other
way.
now,
i
submit
sir
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
at
page
1
of
the
records
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
--
of
the
transcript,
the
printed
transcript
of
the
record,
cash
disbursements
book.
now
your
honors,
payments
too
are
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
would
say
do
come
within
the
records.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
i
would
exclude
and
i
have
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
would
exclude
as
not
coming
within
the
statute.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
the
federal
and
state
tax
returns
for
example.
in
fact
your
honors,
may
i
say
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
--
that
the
past
two
years
that
i
have
been
the
counsel
to
the
judicial
inquiry
must
have
been
expressly,
i
limit,
i
omit
calling
of
federal
state
tax
returns
because
i
do
not
deem
it
to
be
within
my
province
to
become
an
adjunct
of
either
the
federal
internal
revenue
or
the
state
tax.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
worksheets
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
item
12.
copy
the
federal
state
income
tax
returns,
accountant's
worksheets,
and
all
other
--
i
do
not
include
as
declare.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
but
may
i
ask.
that
the
others
are
all
related
through
the
essential
enforcement
of
the
special
rules.
these
payments
that
other
lawyers
have
made
to
runners,
hospital
attendants,
policemen
and
others
are
generally
charged
as
necessary
disbursements
which
come
out
of
the
claimed
share.
it
is
that
that
we
would
like
to
find
out
whether
the
clients
monies
are
being
used
for
alleged
necessary
disbursements
when
in
fact
may
be
a
pay
off
to
an
insurance
adjustment.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
number
10.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
records
of
all
those
made
from
financial
institutions
and
others
open
and
close
as
that
does
have
a
relevancy
in
this
sense.
whether
he
is
borrowing
money
in
order
to
finance
the
contingent
fee
litigation,
well,
i
do
not
think
it's
of
any
grave
importance
as
to
those
records.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
the
specific
statute
is
in
broad
language
and
as
it
reached
today
and
may
i
add
that
in
1900,
in
july
1960
which
was
before
the
petitioner
in
this
case
ultimately
claimed
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
i
will
--
i
must
come
to
that.
the
new
york
--
the
first
department,
television
and
second
departments,
expressly
provide
that
it
shall
include
all
memoranda
data
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
the
--
and
there
pursuant
to
section
90
of
the
judiciary
law
and
are
equivalent
to
statutes
include
cash
and
checks,
vouchers,
all
financial
data
of
that
kind
that
would
be
related
to
the
important
questions
as
to
what
he
did
with
these
trust
matters.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
this
in
view
of
your
honor's
question.
when
the
petitioner
ultimately
asserted
his
refusals,
each
item
in
the
subpoena
this
is
taken.
he
was
asked
about
separately.
he
refused
to
produced
any
want
so
that
if
i
assume
from
the
second
discussion
that
some
of
them
might
not
be
included
within
the
required
records
doctrine,
the
important
finding,
i
won't
anything
but
i
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
what
was
that?
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
the
ground
was
claimed
of
constitution
of
privilege
fifth
amendment.
and
may
i
add
that
in
the
course,
he
also
announced
and
i
won't
answer
any
question
in
relation
thereto.
a
blanket
would
use
to
give
any
and
all
testimonies.
and
when
your
honors,
they
have
already
looked
at
it.
but
when
you
do,
the
amended
(inaudible)
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
makes
that
unmistakably
clear
that
the
two
grounds
upon
which
they
urged
that
he
had
been
denied
his
constitutional
rights,
well,
one
that
he
had
a
right
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
refuse
to
produce
anyone
of
the
records
and
that
the
had
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
and
i'm
quoting
any
question
which
might
be
asked.
now
may
i
ask,
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
no.
there
is
no
immunity
was
promised.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that's
right.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
what
would
be
the
crimes?
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
there's
a
possible
belief
he
paid
the
lay
referral
money
for
the
foreign
cases
to
it.
he
was
thereby
being
aiding
in
embezzlement
a
layman
in
the
practice
of
law
which
is
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
--
criminal
under
new
york
inmate.
as
certainly
it
protects,
he
converted
the
client's
recoveries
for
his
personal
used
that
would
be
lost
in.
so
that
those
are
only
--
was
the
two
possibilities.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
there's
a
possibility,
in
fact,
in
the
record
he
said,
that
there
might
be
tax
problems.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
he
did.
at
one
time
in
the
record,
he
said
that
may
be
tax
problems.
but
my
point
is
this
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i'm
glad
your
honor
you
asked
that
question.
this
period
--
the
period
of
time
covered
in
this.
i
think
it
is
1958,
june
of
1958
until
january
1962,
that's
the
third
at
that
time.
and
at
that
time
the
lawyer
didn't
tell
me
have
not
yet
been
decided.
when
he
first
appeared
and
his
very
first
appearance
before
mr.
justice
arkwright
in
response
to
the
subpoena
this
was
taken.
he
was
asked
by
justice
arkwright,
“where
are
the
records
you
are
required
to
keep
under
rule
iv?”
i
mentioned
this
because
they
said
the
first
time
they
heard
anything
about
the
required
document
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
june
1958
of
the
day
of
his
first
appearance,
“where
are
the
records
that
you
are
required
to
keep
under
rule
iv?”
petitioner
said,
“sir,
the
courts
have
weigh
round
the
records.”
“you
are
required
to
keep
under
the
rule
4
which
is
the
rule
requiring
you
have
set
up
a
special
account.”
mr.
spevack:
“they
are
in
my
check
book.
i
refuse
to
produce
these
checkbooks
or
as
canceled
checks.”
and
then
he
had
taken
the
journal.
and
i
come
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question.
it
was
told
only
warrant
of
the
records.
he
then
instituted
a
separate
proceeding
to
quash
this
thing
raising
constitutional
grounds
and
the
case
came
up
to
here.
up
to
this
court,
they
are
always
denied
certiorari.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that
is
right,
sir.
it
is
that
very
subpoena
that
he
attack
by
independent
proceeding
and
went
through
the
state
court
is
not
--
the
application
to
quash
was
denied.
well,
he
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
before
this
court
and
it
was
denied
and
then
he
came
back
through
the
judicial
inquire
and
then
for
the
first
time
then
he
asserted
not
to
comment
on
that.
he
asserted
state
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
due
process,
fundamental
premise
requirement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes,
and
before
cohen
v.
hurley.
and
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
baker
the
presiding
justice
did
express
the
opinions
likely
to
having
like
to
claim
the
privilege.
but
this
is
serious
question
and
we're
having
a
test
case
coming
up
so
we
will
give
you
an
adjournment.
we'll
wait
till
the
outcome
of
the
test
case
and
then
we'll
give
you
an
opportunity
to
come
by.
now
the
test
case
is
cohen
v.
hurley
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this
point
because
i
have
kept
in
right
in
saying
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
and
there's
one
important
point
as
i
see
it.
cohen
v.
hurley
did
not
deal
where
there
were
five
records
doctrine
at
all
and
as
shown
by
the
majority
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
cohen
case
turned
on
points
refusing
to
answer
some
60
questions.
the
answers
to
which
he
claimed
would
tend
to
incriminate
and
i
check
the
record.
cohen
didn't
refuse
as
or
any
at
all
questions.
on
the
contrary
he
answered
some
but
a
certain
privilege
only
as
to
those
where
the
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate.
and
mr.
justice
black
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
in
footnote
3
pointed
out,
quite
clearly
that
because
the
cohen
case
“hinged”
i'm
quoting
when
i
use
the
word
“hinged”,
on
the
refusal
of
mr.
cohen
to
answer
questions
that
had
been
asked.
mr.
justice
black
put
the
point
of
view
that
his
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated.
now,
we
have
just
the
opposite
kind
of
case
here.
i
say
the
dominant
controlling
fact
from
the
first
hearing
on
june
12,
1958
until
the
last
hearing
in
january
1962.
the
only
thing
that
kept
the
man,
all
we
want
are
the
records.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
oh,
no.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
but
because
the
subpoena
at
the
very
top
says,
“in
connection
with
your
business
as
an
attorney”
and
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
oh!
on
the
contrary,
i
would
like
to
put
it
this
way.
the
petitioner
here
pursuant
to
the
special
rules
filed
with
the
appellate
division
in
a
period
of
seven
and
a
half
years,
1,062
returning
statements
at
over
a
140
cases
a
year.
it
was
in
connection
with
that
business
as
a
single
practitioner
that
we
--
he
was
served
with
this
subpoena
to
produce
records
pertaining
to
his
business
as
an
attorney.
that's
the
only
business
he
has.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
i
should
think
that
anyone
hearing
the
(inaudible)
40
cases
a
year
is
pretty
well
occupied.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
he
could
very
easily
your
honor.
say,
i
produce
this
which
relate
to
my
business
as
an
attorney
and
do
not
produce
those
that
are
purely
private.
may
i
add
that
it
is
in
the
record
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
he
was
charged
with
refusal
to
produce
records
he
was
required
to
keep
it.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
he
was
barred
because
of
that
ground.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
may
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
his
statement,
the
petitioner's
statement,
of
the
record
at
page
31
to
32,
when
he
first
claimed
privilege
and
the
court
said,
“you
better
state
it
again.
the
subpoena
calls
for
the
production
of
the
books.
they
have
not
been
produced.”
the
witness:
“whatever
records,
your
honor,
that
were
available
to
me,
i
could
physically
if
i
have
obtained
the
time.
get
them
together
and
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
at
record
pages
31-32.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
in
this
record.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
at
the
bottom
of
page
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
“i
could
them
together
on
the
package
and
in
bundle
and
bring
them
here
along
side
to
me,
therefore,
if
i
may
say
the
matter
of
producing
production
of
the
records
are
all
having
them
here
physically
is
not
an
issue.”
court
said,
“alright,
bring
that
up
now.”
and
his
attorney
says,
“thank
you.”
and
the
witness
said,
“that
the
only
matter
in
issue
is
the
refusal
to
turn
them
over.
it
is
quite
clear
as
i
see
it
that
the
position
of
the
petitioner
was
that
he
won't
produce
anyone
of
the
records.”
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
i'm
not
saying
here.
although,
i
express
the
opinion
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
--
perhaps
i
will
express
the
opinion
on
broad
side
and
no
right
to
lose
some.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said,
didn't
distinguish,
they
make
a
distinction
as
i
drew
among
with
regard.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
speaking
for
the
state
of
new
york
say,
these
are
the
required
records.
i
merely
indicated
of
what
my
practice
is
since
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
no
--
no
it
wouldn't.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
because
if
the
other
records
--
they
have
not
to
come
within
the
require
record
is
not
true.
he
would
have
the
privilege
as
to
that,
but
he
has
no
privilege.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
feel
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
--
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that.
it's
an
argument
that
could
be
made.
but
i
would
disagree
with
this
reason.
but
under
the
doctrine
of
shapiro
against
u.s.,
he
has
a
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
as
to
records
that
are
required
to
be
kept.
he
does
have
fifth
amendment
privilege
as
to
records,
he
is
not
required
and
also
as
to
the
refuse
to
answer
--
give
all
testimony
that
may
tend
to
incriminate.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
i
hope
i
answer
that.
your
honors,
we
--
in
the
performance
of
our
duties.
we
don't
want
to
deprive
anyone
lawyer
or
not
lawyer
of
his
constitutional
rights
but
i
say
that
a
lawyer
is
entitled
to
the
same
constitutional
rights
as
mr.
malloy
the
gambler
and
malloy
against
hogan,
and
as
mr.
shapiro,
the
wholesale
fruit
dealer
in
the
shapiro
case.
but
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
greater
rights
and
that
is
precisely
the
effect
or
the
position
taken.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
my
position
would
be
that
he
could
not.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
and
i
may
say,
i
think
that
that
is
the
position
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
since
malloy.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
yes.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that
is
correct.
now,
i
said
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
oh!
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
cohen
v.
hurley
is
overruled.
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
this
case,
may
i
put
it
this
way.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
upon
the
party
of
cohen
v.
hurley
and
upon
the
further
ground
that
a
demand
not
the
oral
testimony
but
for
records
required
to
be
kept
by
law
do
not
come
within
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
now
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
coupled
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
here
is
the
holding
in
this
case.
mainly,
that
it
is
not
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
or
fundamental
fairness
which
is
cohen
v.
hurley,
to
disbar
an
attorney
who
refuses
to
produce
unprivileged
records.
that
is
the
holding
in
this
case
whether
or
not
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
malloy
v.
hogan.
the
cohen
v.
hurley
case
dealing
solely
with
a
refusal
to
answer
question
that
my
time
to
incriminate
is
overruled
i
cannot
not
assume
that
authority.
i've
answered
mr.
justice
brennan
on
this
to
what
my
own
point
of
view
is
because
i
happen
to
believe
that
no
lawyr
bunch
of
case
that
make
him
can
be
deprive
of
a
constitutional
right
and
merely
because
are
all
required
to
relinquish.
put
it
that
way
because
that's
the
way
they
brief
repeats
it
to
relinquish
a
constitutional
right
in
order
to
hold
on
to
a
job
or
to
be
a
lawyer.
that's
my
personal
point
of
view
but
i
do
not
speak
for
the
court
of
appeals.
in
this
case,
i
submit
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
fully
aware
of
this
court's
mandate
under
malloy
v.
hogan
that
we
must
follow
the
federal
standard
did
precisely
that.
and
now,
my
learned
adversary
is
asking
to
this
court
really
to
say
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
“mr.
court
of
appeals,
you
had
no
business
following
our
standard
as
enunciated
in
shapiro
and
other
cases.
there
are
others,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
a
good
one
where
federal
statutes
are
involved.”
i
submit
sir,
i
would
add
this.
this
emphasis
on
the
language
selected
from
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
is
on
warrant
and
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
its
no
--
i
don't
mean
any
disrespect
to
this
court
for
me
to
say
that
your
honors
do
not
seek
to
revise
the
opinions
of
an
intermediate
cause
of
the
states.
it
is
only
to
correct
judgments
involving
federal
questions
rendered
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
submit
sirs,
that
on
the
judgment
here
and
on
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner
or
no
way
violated.
and
i
submit
that
is
evident
to
be
held
otherwise
then
not
only
new
york
but
every
state
in
the
union
would
simply
be
frustrated
in
any
reasonable
efforts
to
control
the
abuses
in
contingent
fee
negligence
practice.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
the
rational
as
i
understand
is
this,
that
where
anyone
lawyer
or
anyone
else
engages
in
any
activity
which
is
subject
to
government
regulation
in
there.
government
has
a
strong
social-economic
interest
that
in
order
to
enforce
those
regulations.
records
must
be
kept
then
such
records
do
not
come
within
the
reach
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
well,
i
wouldn't
say
it
is
all
the
written.
i
would
rather
put
it
at
the
--
there's
never
intended
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
even
reach
that
type
of
situation.
i
don't
like
--
i
am
not
--
i
don't
think
it
cuts
down
the
fifth
amendment.
it's
that
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
reach
it.
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that
--
well
that
is
the
effect
of
it.
i
--
mr.
solomon
a.
klein
that
is
right.
and
i
suggest
sirs,
that
that
is
the
thought
expressed
by
mr.
justice
bradley.
it
was
carried
on
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
where
the
federal
government
steps
in,
in
order
to
protect
minimum
wages,
maximum
allowance,
requiring
those
engagements
to
state
commerce,
the
employers
to
keep
records
as
to
the
wages
paid
in
hours
work
in
order
to
protect
the
economy
our
country.
and
this
court,
the
case
is
cited
in
the
shapiro
case,
united
states
against
darby,
unanimously
upheld
that
kind
of
a
valid
regulation.
and
surely,
even
my
adversary
next
on
contention
that
the
special
rules
regulating
the
(inaudible)
of
attorneys
are
invalid.
one
further
thought
subject
to
any
further
questions.
here
is
a
lawyer
who
pursuant
to
the
rules
filed
statements
of
retainer,
gave
information,
profited
by
the
permission
granted
to
engage
in
extensive
contingent
fee
negligence
practice
and
after
he
did
so,
he
was
called
upon
to
account.
he
then
says,
“i
won't”.
and
he
won't
even
answer
any
question.
“i'm
not
aware
of
any
federal
case.
i
never
said
that
any
witnesses
distinguish
from
the
defendant;
reference
is
made
to
griffin
against
california
as
distinguished
from
the
defendant
that
any
witness
called
in
inquiry
where
no
charge
is
made
against
him
and
interpose
a
blanket
of
refusal
to
answer
any
questions
at
all.
as
far
as
i'm
aware
about
federal
and
state
law
agreed
that
he
has
no
such
right.
i
submit
sir
that
the
judgment
should
be
upheld.
