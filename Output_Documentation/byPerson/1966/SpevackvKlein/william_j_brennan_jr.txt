justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
going
back
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
that
is
whether
suppose
we
follow
through
it,
would
that
answer
the
question
whether
the
privilege
in
any
event
was
available
to
any
questions
directed
to
the
records
in
shapiro?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
involved
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
were
told
by
a
chairman
of
an
investigating
committee
that
they
have
a
privilege
and
the
court
said,
no,
didn't
because
in
immunity
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
whether
they
are
about
this
record
which
claims
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
there
not
a
long
continuance
in
the
proceedings
and
perhaps
their
opponents
earlier
cited
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
see
how
he
was
misled
by
the
assurance
in
the
same
way
that
petitioner's
merely
would?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
i
don't
follow
you.
i
thought
you
told
us
at
the
outset
that
initially
he
had
been
through
it.
he
might
--
that
the
privilege
was
available.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
then
there
was
a
suspension
in
the
proceedings
pending
as
a
decision
in
cohen
and
hurley
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
about
that.
what
was
that
suspension
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
we
decided
cohen
and
hurley
at
the
time
of
the
suspension
of
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
my
point
and
i
don't
quite
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
was
that
assurance
denied
on
that
--
have
been
given
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
of
shapiro
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say
mr.
latto,
i'm
not
so
impress
with
that
reply.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
suppose
mr.
klein,
these
were
again
the
same
situation
that
cohen
and
hurley
if
that
is,
suppose
we
have
here
only
a
refuse
to
the
answers-question
on
the
ground
of
the
privilege.
that's
all
we
have
left.
since
malloy
would
you
be
taken
the
position
that
he
could
be
disbarred
for
a
refusal
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
not?
in
other
words
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
since
malloy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
really
what
this
case
look
down
do
you
suggest.
it's
simply
that
this
involved
only
records
therefore
shapiro
covers
it
like
a
blanket.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
ought
not
to
reconsider
as
true.
