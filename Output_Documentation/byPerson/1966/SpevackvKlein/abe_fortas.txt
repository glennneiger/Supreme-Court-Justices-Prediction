justice
abe
fortas
no,
that's
not
his
privilege.
justice
abe
fortas
i
shouldn't
think
so
because
in
fact,
with
in
the
attorney-client
situation
that
the
testimony
is
not
his
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
latto,
are
you
going
to
get
through
the
shapiro
point?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
we
follow
shapiro,
what's
the
effect
on
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
actually
there
were
worse
in
the
question
in
here
except
the
questions
that
the
preliminary
questions
that
would
be
subsumed
under
the
shapiro
doctrine,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
whether
it
is
or
not
where
we
are
at
the
moment
is
that
--
if
we
--
unless
we
overrule
a
modified
theory.
we
have
to
affirm,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
up
to
the
reason
that
--
i
mean
to
say
except
for
(inaudible)
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
--
that
this
is
about
as
completely
confined
to
a
documentary
case
as
you
like
to
define.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
got
two
possible
positions
mr.
latto.
i
think
one
is
that
we
should
overrule
or
modify
shapiro
and
the
other
is
that
somehow
rather
the
record
keeping
division
here
is
different
from
that
involved
in
shapiro.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
bothers
me
is
that
if
the
privilege
does
apply
to
these
records.
i
was
hoping
you
get
to
that
obviously.
can
privilege
does
apply
to
these
records
since
there
any
functions
served
by
the
requirement
that
the
records
be
kept.
let
us
say
the
records
are
required
to
be
kept
for
the
purpose
of
ask
any
whether
lawyers
have
been
doing
things
that
they
ought
to
do
and
as
if
when
you
do
have
a
problem
here.
it
seems
to
me
as
to
whether
that
particular
function
in
the
record
keeping
statute
serves
any
purpose
whatsoever
if
the
privilege
stands
to
them.
i've
been
bothered
by
this,
i'm
trying
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
have
indicated
the
fruits?
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
there's
difference
between
documentary
matter
and
records
that
are
properly
required
to
be
kept
by
statute
regulatory
records
as
in
shapiro?
justice
abe
fortas
now
with
the
question,
i
think
that
anyway
i'm
interest
in
is
which
of
these
records
is
and
which
is
not
required
to
be
kept
by
this
specific
statute
that
is
said
statute
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
man
--
was
this
the
man
for
production
that
was
sustained
in
another
action
in
the
new
york
courts?
did
petitioner
challenged
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
the
subpoena
--
the
demand
but
now
appears
on
page
1
of
defendant
record.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
demand
was
for
records
beyond
the
records
that
he
was
required
to
keep
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
then
i
suppose
that
if
he
produced
just
the
records
that
were
required
--
that
he
was
required
to
keep
that
that
might
very
well
constitute
a
waiver
as
to
other
records.
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure.
but
are
you
sure
about
that?
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
say
that
the
common
understanding
below
is
that
if
you
produce
some
of
the
records
relating
to
a
given
subject
matter
that
--
that's
a
waiver
of
the
privilege
as
to
the
balance
of
the
record
relating
to
the
subject
matter.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
very
nice.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
that's
not
his
privilege.
