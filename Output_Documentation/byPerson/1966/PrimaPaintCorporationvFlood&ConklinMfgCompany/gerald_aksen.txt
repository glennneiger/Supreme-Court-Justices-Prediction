mr.
gerald
aksen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gerald
aksen
please
the
court.
amicus
wishes
to
make
clear
in
this
case
that
it
has
a
no
opinion
whatsoever
with
reference
to
the
facts
whether
or
not
interstate
commerce
is
involved.
amicus
is
terribly
concerned
the
effect,
the
decision
of
this
court
would
have
on
commercial
arbitration
in
this
country.
it
is
also
terribly
concerned
with
the
attitude
of
the
courts
for
the
concept
of
a
voluntary
arbitration,
which
must
be
severely
differentiated
from
compulsory
arbitration,
which
exists
in
this
country
only
to
a
very,
very
limited
extent.
outside
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
the
railway
labor
cases
we
do
not
have
compulsory
arbitration
in
this
country.
we
are
speaking
about
here
--
mr.
gerald
aksen
no
sir,
the
arbitration--
mr.
gerald
aksen
no
sir,
the
arbitration
association
was
formed
the
year
after
the
arbitration
statute
was
passed.
this
act
was
enacted
january
1,
1926;
the
arbitration
association
was
formed
in
march
of
1926.
mr.
gerald
aksen
no
sir.
mr.
gerald
aksen
this
was
an
entirely
new
association
formed
in
1926
after
the
enactment
of
the
federal
act.
the
associations
that
sponsored
this
law
will
be
found
at
the
back
of
the
amicus
brief.
there
are
122,
that
we
were
able
to
locate
today
from
our
files
and
records
of
1923,
24
and
25,
all
business
concerns
and
chambers
of
commerce
throughout
almost
every
state
in
the
united
states
at
the
time.
mr.
gerald
aksen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
aksen
exactly
correct.
it
is
interesting
for
us
to
note
that
this
court
very
forcefully
1957
and
1960,
set
forth
a
national
policy
on
labor
arbitration,
they
had
no
difficulty
with
that,
we
are
now
faced
with
the
crossroads
in
american
history,
but
whether
or
not
the
common
law
hostility
will
now
once
and
for
all
be
discarded.
congress
made
it
perfectly
clear
in
1920,
this
has
been
observed
by
one
justice.
there
were
only
two
states
in
1920
that
had
a
provision
which
made
arbitration
agreements
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable.
it
will
be
an
absurdity
to
think
that
all
these
business
organizations
wanted
a
law
which
would
enforce
only
a
state
created
right
of
two
states.
mr.
gerald
aksen
the
rules
provide
your
honor
at
the
moment
in
this
case
we're
referring
to
the
commercial
arbitration
rules,
that
unless
the
law
provides
for
the
contrary.
mr.
gerald
aksen
right,
that's
what
the
rules
specify,
unless
the
law
provides
for
the
contrary.
if
the
law
had
prohibit
arbitration
in
any
state,
the
arbitration
association
would
not
be
operating
in
that
particular
state.
the
association
is
not
merely
an
administrator
of
commercial
arbitrations,
it
is
the
largest
single
private
organization
in
the
country
responsible
for
administering
labor
arbitration,
commercial
arbitration
and
insurance
arbitrations.
mr.
gerald
aksen
nothing
whatsoever
your
honor.
you'll
find
our
clause
mentioned
on
the
inside
cover
of
the
rules.
it
has
no
specific
reference
to
what
law
should
prevail.
i
believe
mr.
justice
black
is
referring
to
the
clause
used
generally
by
the
textile
industry
of
the
united
states
because
of
its
history,
the
textile
industry
has
particularly
desired
to
stay
out
of
court,
they
have
provided
--
mr.
gerald
aksen
this
is
not
our
preference
or
our
clause
in
anyway.
the
parties
wish
to
put
that
in
the
contract,
we
regard
it
as
an
item
of
negotiation
as
any
other
part
of
the
contract,
we
are
assuming
we
are
talking
about
negotiated
contracts,
if
the
buyer
refuses
to
sign
that
part
of
the
clause,
he
should
attempt
to
change
it,
but
clearly
they
voluntarily
intend
and
in
the
bar
case
and
our
interest
in
this
matter
is,
the
arbitration
association
has
sponsored
what
it
considers
to
be
the
broadest
possible
arbitration
clause
to
show
the
parties
attempt
to
arbitrate
every
dispute
that
arises
out
of
that
contract
unless
one
party
can
clearly
show
that
the
arbitration
agreement
itself
was
fraudulently
induced.
we
in
no
way
intend
to
deprive
the
court
of
deciding
whether
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
was
itself
fraudulently
induced,
but
both
congress
in
the
very
federal
arbitration
act,
and
the
fact
of
arbitration
itself
necessitate
that
the
arbitration
clause
be
looked
to,
to
make
this
determination.
the
doctrine
of
separability
is
one
of
constructive
intent
that
must
be
followed
and
we
hardly
recommend
that
the
view
endorsed
by
lawrence,
if
commercial
arbitration
is
to
exist
in
this
country
the
way
the
businessmen
desire
it.
it
is
a
voluntary
contract
between
two
parties,
to
go
to
arbitration.
there
is
no
requirement
but
they
put
this
clause
in,
they
may
narrow
it
in
anyway
they
like,
we're
not
saying
to
the
court
to
use
this
clause
or
interpret
it
this
way
if
it's
narrow,
only
where
the
party
is
saying,
as
we
claim
they
say
here,
as
if
it
was
said
in
haec
verba
the
parties
intend
to
arbitrate
everything
including
fraudulent
inducement
of
the
contract,
but
not
fraudulent
inducement
of
the
arbitration
clause.
mr.
gerald
aksen
i
can
only
recommend
the
alignment
set
forth
by
judge
medina.
mr.
gerald
aksen
who
used
it
basically
to
bolster
the
substantive
intent
of
the
law.
had
it
been
a
procedural
law
only,
he
said
this
sentence
would
not
have
been
necessary.
but
this
sentence
plus
the
very
fact
that
section
14,
in
the
law
which
says
this
law
shall
not
apply
to
contracts
signed
before
january
1,
1926
to
him
completely
shows
the
substantive
intent
necessary
in
1924
before
erie.
mr.
gerald
aksen
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
federal
act
clearly
shows
under
federal
substantive
law,
what
the
attitude
of
the
united
states
is
with
regard
to
arbitration
agreements
and
if
in
fact,
the
act
was
substantive
the
states
will
follow
that,
and
this
court
can
settle
the
question
now
once
and
for
all
as
it
did
lincoln
mills
case
in
1957.
mr.
gerald
aksen
yes,
mr.
justice
white
it
is.
it
is
our
opinion
that
labor
arbitration
is,
despite
the
fact
that
it's
a
substitute
for
industrial
strike,
it
is
nevertheless
we
administer
5,000
of
these
cases
every
year
purely
a
dispute
between
a
grievance
and
this
company.
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
of
the
disputes
between
commercial
businessmen
are
quite
more
important
time
and
in
money.
and
if
one
company
goes
out
of
business
because
he
can't
get
a
prompt
decision,
many
employees
union
or
not
may
lose
their
job
as
a
result.
mr.
gerald
aksen
no
sir
i
have
no
figures
on
that.
mr.
gerald
aksen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gerald
aksen
please
the
court.
amicus
wishes
to
make
clear
in
this
case
that
it

a
no

cases
