justice
abe
fortas
just
hold
on,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
suppose
it's
essential
in
your
case
to
establish
that
new
york
law
would
permit
you
access
to
the
courts
rather
than
remitting
you
to
the
arbitration.
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
there
a
difference
between
you
and
your
adversary
as
to
what
new
york
law
is
on
this
subject?
to
say
to
you
that
my
attention
has
been
called
to
application
of
case
of
application
of
amphenol
corporation
266
new
york
supplement,
second,
768
that
was
later
affirmed
in
the
appellant
division,
is
quite
a
recent
case
and
that
states
new
york
law
to
be
in
accordance
with
judge
medina's
announcement
that
is
to
say
that
in
this
sort
of
a
situation
even
though
you
are
relying
on
fraud
and
inducement
you've
got
to
got
arbitrated.
are
you
are
familiar
with
that?
justice

seen
it
cited

maybe
some
movement
