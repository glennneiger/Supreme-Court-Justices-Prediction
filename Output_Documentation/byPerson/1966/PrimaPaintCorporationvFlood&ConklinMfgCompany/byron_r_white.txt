justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
think
if
the
state
statute
said
arbitration
agreements
shall
not
be
enforceable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
have
a
transaction
affecting
commerce
and
the
contract
calling
for
arbitration
and
one
of
the
party
sues
the
other
in
a
contest
of
dispute
to
enforce
arbitration.
in
the
federal
court,
in
the
state
that
has
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
are
not
enforced
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
to
require
arbitration
agreements
to
be
enforced
in
transactions
effect
of
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
shall
be
valid
and
enforceable.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
court
decided
that
this
statute
was
to
be
construed
as
meaning
that
congress
really
didn't
intend
to
enforce
arbitration
contracts
in
interstate
transaction
despite
provisions
of
local
law
you
would
--
would
you,
is
part
of
your
position
that
that
is
an
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
nobody
suggests
that
erie
means
that
a
dependent
in
the
diversity
suit
may
not
invoke
a
federal
statute
as
a
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
question
--
very
much
different
here
is
that,
what
we
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that's
supposed
to
be
--
one
simply
said
the
labor
contracts
are
to
be
enforceable
but
(inaudible)
enforced.
this
contract,
this
statute
says,
arbitration
agreements
will
be
enforced.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
courts
of
appeals
agree
with
the
second
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
courts
of
appeals
agree
with
the
second
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
several
others
who
have
very
expressly
disagreed
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
any
circuit
disagreed
with
robert
lawrence
before
of
course?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
conflict
on
what
robert
lawrence
was
granted.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
they
changed
their
mind
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
an
outstanding
concept
in
the
second
and
ninth
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
get
the
federal
court
to
enforce
an
interstate
arbitration
agreement
in
accordance
with
the
federal
arbitration
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
is
that?
if
you
think
that
arbitration
act
is
substantive,
it
gives
people
the
formative
rights
of
raising
a
federal
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
here
and
that
this
was
a
diversity
case,
in
fact
the
plaintiff
didn't
plead
in
the
federal
question,
but
you
pleaded
a
--
well
you
pleaded
federal
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
if
that
had
been
turn
around
would
you,
why
could
you
–
you
sued
in
the
federal
court,
if
the
federal
question
to
enforce
your
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
yet
you
don't
well
seem
to
argue
in
your
brief
or
discuss
the
question
whether
or
not
this
particular
contract
under
the
commerce
law,
whether
this
is
commerce,
this
employment
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mentioned
it,
i
don't
see
any
development.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
are
fair
and
would
make
almost
any
employment
contract
with
any
industrial
company
in
interstate
commerce
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
i
think
you
take
your
position,
i
don't
see
how
we
could
avoid
calling
that
almost
any
employment
contract
with
any
company
like
general
electric,
dupont.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
isn't
but
i'd
say
if
we
take
your
position
i
don't
see
how
we
can
help
taking
the
next
one,
what
would
be
the
distinction?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
case
had
an
employment
--
my
employment
contract
with
general
electric,
you
must
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes,
you
should
take
the
same
course?
justice
byron
r.

what
would
you
think
if
the
