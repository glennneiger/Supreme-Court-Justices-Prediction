mr.
robert
p.
herzog
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
milestone
in
constitutional
law
was
reached
by
this
court
in
1938
when
it
held
in
erie
against
tompkins
railroad
company
that
in
cases
involving
disputes
between
citizens
of
different
states
the
federal
court
hearing
such
a
case
will
settle
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
applicable
state
substantive
law.
this
ruling
was
made
to
inform
uniformity,
that
we
show
uniformity
of
decision
in
litigation.
this
case
brings
again
the
problem
of
erie
before
this
court
and
in
particularly,
it's
application
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
contracts
concerning
that
act
in
litigation
between
citizens.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
these
bodies
entered
into
a
contract,
an
employment
contract,
which
contained
the
an
arbitration
clause.
the
petitioners
subsequently
discovered
or
alleged
that
it
had
been
fraudulently
induced
to
make
this
agreement.
the
petitioner
instituted
an
action
in
the
court
below
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
alleging
equitable
fraud
and
sought
a
recession
of
the
contract.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
was
based
solely
upon
diversity
of
the
parties
and
jurisdictional
amount.
the
respondent
had
immediately
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
action
demanded
arbitration
pursuant
to
the
statutes
and
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
section
7503(c)
of
the
new
york
state
civil
rules
and
procedure.
the
respondent
additionally
has
disputed
throughout
these
proceedings
the
factual
allegations
of
fraud
made
by
the
petitioner.
these
factual
allegations
pertinent
here
is
that
the
petitioner
would
have
never
made
this
contract,
had
it
had
not
been
for
the
representation
by
the
respondent
that
it
was
a
solvent
corporation?
seven
days
after
the
respondent
and
petitioner
made
this
contract
the
respondent
filed
a
voluntary
petition
in
chapter
11
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey,
and
suffered
a
receivership
of
its
property.
in
fact
the
agreement
which
was
signed
on
october
7th
had
been
accelerated
at
the
request
of
the
respondent,
and
seven
days
later
a
chapter
11
proceeding
suit
and
receivership.
in
the
federal
action,
which
the
petitioner
brought
motions
were
made
simultaneously
with
its
institution.
a
motion
was
made
by
the
petitioner
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
stay
the
demand
for
arbitration.
this
was
required
because
new
york
law
or
under
the
law
of
new
york
petitioner
would
have
been
substantively
prevented
from
challenging
the
validity
of
the
contract.
the
respondent
made
a
cross
motion
to
stay
the
federal
action
and
on
the
other
hand
compelled
arbitration
pursuant
to
the
arbitration
clause
contained
in
the
contract.
thus
the
essential
question
presented
here
is
what
tribunal
in
the
first
instance
is
going
to
investigating
the
site,
a
preliminary
threshold
question
of
fraud,
will
it
be
a
court
of
law
or
it
will
be
an
arbitration
panel.
the
differences
i
don't
think
are
pertinent
at
the
moment
because
this
court
in
bernhardt
and
in
wilko
v.
swan
has
gone
into
the
radical
difference
between
arbitration
in
a
court
of
law
and
the
substantial
effect
that
each
tribunal
can
have
on
the
result
and
outcome
of
the
course
of
action.
the
courts
below
in
this
matter
have
uniformly
applied
the
precedent
established
by
judge
medina
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
robert
lawrence
company
versus
devonshire
fabrics.
this
case
is
incidentally
is
in
conflict
with
decisions
in
the
sixth
and
ninth
circuit
and
has
been
criticized
by
the
first
circuit
for
some
of
its
proposition.
judge
medina
in
the
lawrence
case,
and
i
should
say
the
courts
below
invoking
the
robert
lawrence
proposition
against
the
petitioner
here
relegated
the
petitioner
as
a
matter
of
federal
substantive
law
to
the
arbitration
panel.
the
question
of
the
very
validity
and
existence
of
this
contract
and
whether
the
petitioner
would
have
made
and
entered
it
was
therefore
to
be
decided
by
the
arbitrators
under
the
clause
in
the
contract.
this
proposition
of
law
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
state
of
new
york
where
this
diversity
action
was
prosecuted.
now
judge
medina
reached
this
result
by
the
following
legal
reasoning
in
the
lawrence
case.
the
reason
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
created
national
substantive
law
and
to
support
this
substantive
--
national
substantive
law
because
it
would
conflict
or
clash
with
the
erie
doctrine,
he
devised
a
doctrine
of
separability
of
the
causes
of
the
contract.
he
reasoned
that
congress
intended
or
referred
to
in
an
arbitration
act
as
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
that,
that
meant
the
very
clause.
through
this
reasoning
he
claimed
that
the
contract
to
arbitrate
was
separable
provision
and
therefore
if
you
do
not
allege
a
fraud
as
to
the
clause,
then
a
fraud
as
to
any
portion
of
the
agreement,
no
matter
what
materiality
it
had,
no
matter
what
the
reliances,
you
are
relegated
to
the
informal
tribunal
of
arbitration,
notwithstanding
the
contrary
state
law
which
judge
medina
recognized
at
that
time
at
1960
to
be
that
a
fraud
permeates
the
entire
agreement
and
a
fraud
as
to
any
other
portion
of
the
agreement
would
therefore
--
therefore
the
whole
agreement
would
fall
completely.
the
second
reasoning,
he
said
it
was
clearly
constitutional
and
the
petitioner
says
that
this
result
of
judge
medina's
which
conflicts
with
the
erie
principle
is
obviously
unconstitutional,
in
that
you
put
a
premium
on
the
fact
that
these
parties
were
of
diverse
citizenship
and
that
further
you
encourage
forum
shopping
and
all
the
resultant
wrongs
that
erie
sought
to
correct
and
third,
petitioner
asserts
that
judge
medina
notwithstanding
section
4
which
set
up
a
whole
procedure
for
a
preliminary
hearing
on
the
question
of
validity
of
contract
said
as
a
matter
of
law
and
we
feel
that
he
violated
the
whole
intent
of
congress
in
cutting
out
this
problem
of
a
hearing
effectively
the
only
hearing
you
can
have
under
judge
medina's
proposition
is
if
you
alleged
fraud
as
the
arbitration
clause,
you
don't
allege
any
such
fraud,
any
other
issues
for
the
arbitrators.
we
submit
that
judge
medina's
legal
reasoning
is
erroneous
and
conflict
with
--
except
to
constitutional
limitations
announced
by
this
court.
now
a
preliminary
question,
we
recognize
and
which
is
one
of
the
issues
here
is
that
in
order
for
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
apply
in
the
first
instance,
the
court
my
preliminarily
make
a
determination
that
the
contract
evidence
as
a
transaction
and
interstate
commerce
or
a
maritime
transaction
which
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
petitioner
maintains
that
this
contract
is
a
mere
employment
contract
and
the
contract
speaks
for
itself
and
for
that
reason,
i
will
not
venture
in
to
this
point,
i
think
the
briefs
are
adequate
on
it.
but
we
continue
to
say
and
we
move
to
the
second
proposition
assuming
this
court
were
to
find
that
this
case
is
not
four
squared
in
point
with
bernhardt
versus
polygraphic
company
of
the
united
states.
that
decision
of
1956
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas
held
that
section
3
was
not
to
be
construed
by
second
circuit
as
to
be
so
broad
as
to
reach
all
contracts
and
that
section
2
was
definition
on
its
scope
and
that
therefore
section
3
could
only
reach
those
contracts
defined
in
section
2.
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
douglas
specifically
pointed
out
that
we
hold
this
way
to
avoid
the
constitutional
implications.
we
hold
that
this
a
bernhardt
case,
it's
an
employment
contract
it's
not
a
transaction,
it's
not
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
in
interstate
commerce.
notwithstanding
that
if
the
contract
were
assumed
to
be
in
commerce
and
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
be
applicable,
we
feel
that
the
court
further
erred
below
in
concluding
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
created
national
substantive
law.
there
is
no
intent
of
congress
specified
in
this
act,
either
in
the
act
itself
or
in
any
of
the
sub-committee
hearings
and
in
the
writings
of
contemporary
authors.
in
fact,
quite
the
opposite,
the
hearings
in
the
congressional
record
allude
to
this
act
as
being
procedural
and
relating
to
the
law
of
remedy.
we
further
maintain
that
this
court
in
the
bernhardt
case
has
already
indicated
that
section
2
was
procedural,
when
it
said
it
was
definitional
in
scope.
we
further
point
out
to
the
court
that
all
the
other
sections
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
1
through
14,
i
should
say
3
through
14
are
procedural
in
all
of
their
application
and
could
not
possibly
be
legally
construed
to
have
an
substantive
effect.
we
therefore
feel
--
now
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
in
1924
just
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
the
court
passed
a
decision
down
on
this
red
cross
line
case
by
mr.
justice
brandeis,
in
that
case
mr.
brandeis
for
the
first
time
established
that
contracts
containing
arbitration
clauses
and
arbitration
agreements
themselves
were
valid
and
created
a
perfect
obligation.
in
1925,
we
believe
the
congress
relied
on
the
precedent
to
the
red
cross
case
and
therefore
when
congress
created
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
specifically
referred
to
in
section
2,
the
act
that
--
the
section
of
the
act
that
we
are
looking
at,
we
say
that
they
didn't
intend
to
create
substantive
rights
because
these
existed
because
of
the
red
cross
--
the
red
cross
line
case.
the
validity
of
a
contract
was
now
the
law
of
the
land;
we
therefore
say
that
congress
was
merely
roaring
a
procedural
statute
to
enforce
what
was
now
an
existing
right,
that
is
the
right
to
have
arbitration
contracts
recognized
as
valid
and
not
an
ouster
of
judicial
court
jurisdiction.
for
more
--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
that's
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes.
i
am.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
i
didn't
cite
it
in
the
reply
brief
but
i
know
it
is
distinguishable
as
are
the
other
cases,
when
the
facts
of
the
case
are
pierced
out.
appendix
a
to
the
reply
has
a
recent
1965
unpublished
opinion
by
judge
inzer
wyatt
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
which
all
these
cases
were
analyzed
by
the
district
judge.
the
only
case
cited
in
these
proceedings
by
the
circuit
court,
was
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
fabrics
and
judge
--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
that's
right,
the
only
new
york
case
and
judge
wayte
concludes
that
fabrics
if
not
distinguishable
then
the
decision
must
be
considered
with
great
--
that's
appendix
8a
in
the
reply
brief
your
honor.
it
says
the
fabrics
is
not
--
if
not
so
distinguishable
then
the
decision
must
be
considered
with
great
deference
to
be
wrong,
now
this
was
the
sole
new
york
case
relied
on--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
your
honor
but
to
get
you
--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
your
honor.
now
this
decision
of
wayte,
of
judge
wayte
goes
through
all
the
cases,
all
the
material
cases
and
stands
for
the
proposition
that
new
york
law
is
unchanged
and
still
is,
that
recession
for
fraud
vitiates
the
entire
agreement.
we
submit
that
the
amphenol
case
is
not
distinguishable
your
honor
is
certainly
not
the
law
as
an
inferior
court
decision
it's
only
an
appellate
provision.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yeah,
but
the
highest
court
here
is
the
court
of
appeals
which
has
annunciated
the
(inaudible)
which
is
discussed
at
length
in
judge
wyatt
decision
which
is
a
part
of
the
appendix
and
we
say
that
this
court,
the
federal
courts
must
look
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
order
to
determine
what
its
precedent
is.
it
maybe
and
this
is
to
be
conceded,
it
may
be
the
new
york
law
is
slowly
changing,
this
court
even
changes
the
law,
but
at
the
present
time
and
in
the
context
of
this
case,
new
york
law
is
contrary.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well,
the
petitioner
relies
on
the
analysis
of
(inaudible)
which
judge
waytt
sets
forth
there.
it
was
a
3:4
decision,
but
he
has
a
very
incisive
analyzation
of
that
case
and
shows
that
the
action
can
be
practically
considered
--
the
decision
can
be
practically
considered
a
unanimous
decision
because
addictive
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
there
may
be
your
honor,
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
lawrence
case
which
is
the
precedent,
here
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
revoke
or
overturn
in
1960
judge
medina
admitted
in
the
record
in
the
decision
that
new
york
law
was
contrary
and
use
that
as
an
assumption
arriving
at
its
decision.
the
petitioner
maintains
that
if
you
look
at
all
this
procedural
discussion,
the
intent
of
the
congress,
the
hearings,
the
writers,
the
fact
that
the
legislation
originated
out
of
the
judiciary
committees
of
both
houses
obviously
perhaps
article
3
legislation,
although
article
1
may
have
been
used
for
the
commerce,
course
used
to
buttress
this
legislation
and
thus
give
it
a
broader
legislative
base.
if
you
read
bernhardt
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
other
sections
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
plus
a
red
cross
line,
we
conclude
that
it's
only
susceptible
of
one
conclusion
that
this
act
is
procedural
in
it's
application
where
diversity
of
citizenship
applies.
even
though
the
act
evidences
a
contract
in
interstate
commerce.
by
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
court
again
avoids
any
constitutional
problem
that
erie
would
present.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
i
believe
only
three
or
four
had
arbitration
acts
new
jersey,
new
york
and
perhaps
one
of
them.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
no,
your
honor
the
arbitration
act
that
congress
passed
was
patented
on
the
new
york
act
which
had
been
passed
five
years
earlier.
the
new
york
courts
have
characterized
the
act
when
it
was
being
constitutional
and
the
cases
cited,
--
slip
my
mind
at
any
rate
that
the
act
was
remedial
on
its
application
and
procedure.
congress
now
passed
this
act
under
the
sponsorship
of
the
american
bar
association
in
an
attempt
to
try
and
permit
citizens
in
the
various
states
to
have
the
same
procedural
remedies
that
the
states
returning
to
these
are
regular
tribunals
of
arbitration
and
particularly
and
it
was
more
important
in
the
commercial
centers
of
this
country.
arbitration,
if
you
look
at
the
expansion
of
it
expanded
sort
of
west,
its
thoughts
in
the
urban
centers
and
then
goes
throughout
the
country.
so
new
york
possibly
being
a
principle
urban
center
and
new
jersey
and
various
other
states
rapidly
fell
into
law
and
passing
arbitration
acts
at
the
insistence
of
their
citizens
for
whatever
commercial
needs
they
needed.
and
congress
was
persuaded
of
course
to
undertake
similar
legislations
so
there
would
be
problem
--
pardon
me
no
problem
in
the
federal
court
coming
up
with
perhaps
different
results.
we
say
congress
even
recognized
there
that
in
a
sense
to
have
different
system
of
procedure
might
work
wrongs
but
we
say
it
was
procedural,
and
it's
wholly
procedure
and
even
judge
medina
in
the
lawrence
case
and
the
other
lower
courts
have
held
that
the
federal
arbitration
has
independent
federal
basis
for
jurisdiction
and
this
is
essentially
the
erie
problem,
we're
coming
to
because
if
you
hold
it
substantive
and
apply
erie
and
new
york
and
oregon
the
cases
involving
procedure
certain
parts
of
the
procedural
laws
can
have
substantive
outcome
on
a
litigation.
we
are
going
to
find
a
situation
where
the
opposite
of
erie
occurs.
it's
not
the
fact
that
you
are
diverse
citizen
that
works
so
wrong,
it's
the
fact
that
the
contract
is
between
citizens
of
the
same
states,
the
new
two
new
yorkers
that
have
an
that
have
arbitration
and
fraud
will
vitiate
it
have
a
different
result.
a
hypothetical
would
be,
if
i
contract
with
my
opponent
here
to
ship
interstate
goods
to
california
and
it's
under
$10,000,
there
is
no
independent
right
to
get
into
court
and
we
arbitrate
and
an
attempt
to
arbitrate
is
made
in
new
york,
i
have
worked
in
new
york
law
to
my
favor
and
the
contract
falls
under
current
law.
but
if
we
were
diverse
citizens,
if
he
was
a
jersey
resident
we
could
then
forum
shop
and
pick
our
court,
go
into
the
federal
court
and
a
different
result
would
follow
if
you
follow
judge
medina's
lawrence
holding.
therefore
we
say
the
proper
rule
of
law
to
apply
to
this
type
of
litigation
is
a
rule
of
common
law
or
the
state
common
law
that
fraud
vitiates
the
entire
agreement.
now,
we
say
the
congress
intended
to
because
they
saved
this
in
section
2
of
the
act.
the
section
says
that
arbitration
agreements
are
valid
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exist
at
lower
end
equity
for
the
revocation
there
of.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
i
would
say
that,
that
is
a
policy
of
the
state
and
its
citizens
to
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
i
would
say
that
the
federal
court
should
apply
the
state
law
because
--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
that's
correct
your
honor
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
applying
the
common
law
of
the
state
can
possibly
be
considered
invidious
restraint
on
interstate
commerce,
if
we
the
commerce
–-
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well,
i
think
congress
may
have
but
they
didn't
intend
it,
when
they
framed
this
act.
the
act
is
not
as
drafted
as
to
permit.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well
that
means
that
they
are
revocable
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
well,
i
should
say
that
they
are
not
revocable
that
they
are
valid
and
i
say
that
the
state
court
that
the
federal
court
sitting
in
such
a
situation
your
honor,
must
find
it
must
apply
the
state
law
and
then
perhaps
in
those
cases
a
policy
decision
what
we
have
to
be
made
as
to
whether
the
contract
is
to
be
deemed
valid
because
of
the
commerce
powers
or
the
powers
the
congress
to
regulate
contracts
touching
on
these
or
to
determine
that
this
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
legislate
into
this
area
and
to
deem
it
that
the
state
law
to
apply
and
the
contract
will
thus
be
move
forward
as
far
as
the
arbitration
cause
concerned.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well,
i
would
say
if
you
are
going
to
find
a
constitutional
basis
that
it
was
article
1
the
commerce
clause,
and
that
the
act
was
then
substantive,
you
than
run
into
the
erie
doctrine
in
where
you
are
going
to
have
the
situation
that
non
citizens
are
going
to
have
a
different
result
as
opposed
to
litigation
involving
diversity
of
citizens.
and
so
i
think
it's
equally
objectionable.
further
than
that
you
have
to
find
a
preemption
of
the
act
and
you're
going
to
have
to
enforce
this
unique
separability
doctrine
that
judge
medina
imposed
and
thus
throw
out
the
whole
concept
of
the
intrical
nature
of
a
contract.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well,
with
the
preemption
doctrine
your
honor
you
could
then
claim
that
the
court
could
then
find
that
the
state
law
was
preempted
to
the
extent
of
the
federalization
of
the
arbitration
and
that
thus
the
contract,
the
arbitration
clause
itself
was
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
i
think
so
there
is
no
national
policy
involved
sir
in
this
case,
lincoln
mills
and
the
other
cases
will
come
under
the
nlra
and
the
labor
acts
in
which
there
was
a
strong
national
policy.
here
the
only,
there
is
no
restraint
on
commerce
being
imposed.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
but
we
still
feel
that
there
was
that
the
rational
differences
that
there
is
a
concurrent
power
here
between
the
state
congress
and
arbitration
didn't
want
to
outlaw
all
interstate,
all
state
contacts
with
commerce
--
they
just
wanted
to
prevent
restrains
that
would
impede
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
we
don't
see
how
this
policy
of
holding
the
federal
act
that
the
state
law
is
applicable
can
be
considered
impeding
of
commerce.
it's
merely
relegating
you
to
a
court
either
a
court
in
the
first
instance
to
the
try
the
issue
of
fraud
or
the
arbitrators
and
we
feel
that
the
substantial
difference
between
arbitration
and
a
court
of
law
should
have
this
preliminary
threshold
question,
the
existence,
the
meeting
of
a
mind,
there
certainly
can't
be
an
arbitration
contract
if
there
is
no
meeting
of
the
mind.
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
milestone
in
constitutional
law
was
reached
by
this
court
in
1938
when
it
held
in
erie
against
tompkins
railroad
company
that
in
cases
involving
disputes
between
citizens
of
different
states
the
federal
court
hearing
such
a
case
will
settle
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
applicable
state
substantive
law.
this
ruling
was
made
to
inform
uniformity,
that
we
show
uniformity
of
decision
in
litigation.
this
case
brings
again
the
problem
of
erie
before
this
court
and
in
particularly,
it's
application
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
contracts
concerning
that
act
in
litigation
between
citizens.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
these
bodies
entered
into
a
contract,
an
employment
contract,
which
contained
the
an
arbitration
clause.
the
petitioners
subsequently
discovered
or
alleged
that
it
had
been
fraudulently
induced
to
make
this
agreement.
the
petitioner
instituted
an
action
in
the
court
below
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
alleging
equitable
fraud
and
sought
a
recession
of
the
contract.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
was
based
solely
upon
diversity
of
the
parties
and
jurisdictional
amount.
the
respondent
had
immediately
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
action
demanded
arbitration
pursuant
to
the
statutes
and
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
section
7503(c)
of
the
new
york
state
civil
rules
and
procedure.
the
respondent
additionally
has
disputed
throughout
these
proceedings
the
factual
allegations
of
fraud
made
by
the
petitioner.
these
factual
allegations
pertinent
here
is
that
the
petitioner
would
have
never
made
this
contract,
had
it
had
not
been
for
the
representation
by
the
respondent
that
it
was
a
solvent
corporation?
seven
days
after
the
respondent
and
petitioner
made
this
contract
the
respondent
filed
a
voluntary
petition
in
chapter
11
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey,
and
suffered
a
receivership
of
its
property.
in
fact
the
agreement
which
was
signed
on
october
7th
had
been
accelerated
at
the
request
of
the
respondent,
and
seven
days
later
a
chapter
11
proceeding
suit
and
receivership.
in
the
federal
action,
which
the
petitioner
brought
motions
were
made
simultaneously
with
its
institution.
a
motion
was
made
by
the
petitioner
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
stay
the
demand
for
arbitration.
this
was
required
because
new
york
law
or
under
the
law
of
new
york
petitioner
would
have
been
substantively
prevented
from
challenging
the
validity
of
the
contract.
the
respondent
made
a
cross
motion
to
stay
the
federal
action
and
on
the
other
hand
compelled
arbitration
pursuant
to
the
arbitration
clause
contained
in
the
contract.
thus
the
essential
question
presented
here
is
what
tribunal
in
the
first
instance
is
going
to
investigating
the
site,
a
preliminary
threshold
question
of
fraud,
will
it
be
a
court
of
law
or
it
will
be
an
arbitration
panel.
the
differences
i
don't
think
are
pertinent
at
the
moment
because
this
court
in
bernhardt
and
in
wilko
v.
swan
has
gone
into
the
radical
difference
between
arbitration
in
a
court
of
law
and
the
substantial
effect
that
each
tribunal
can
have
on
the
result
and
outcome
of
the
course
of
action.
the
courts
below
in
this
matter
have
uniformly
applied
the
precedent
established
by
judge
medina
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
robert
lawrence
company
versus
devonshire
fabrics.
this
case
is
incidentally
is
in
conflict
with
decisions
in
the
sixth
and
ninth
circuit
and
has
been
criticized
by
the
first
circuit
for
some
of
its
proposition.
judge
medina
in
the
lawrence
case,
and
i
should
say
the
courts
below
invoking
the
robert
lawrence
proposition
against
the
petitioner
here
relegated
the
petitioner
as
a
matter
of
federal
substantive
law
to
the
arbitration
panel.
the
question
of
the
very
validity
and
existence
of
this
contract
and
whether
the
petitioner
would
have
made
and
entered
it
was
therefore
to
be
decided
by
the
arbitrators
under
the
clause
in
the
contract.
this
proposition
of
law
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
state
of
new
york
where
this
diversity
action
was
prosecuted.
now
judge
medina
reached
this
result
by
the
following
legal
reasoning
in
the
lawrence
case.
the
reason
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
created
national
substantive
law
and
to
support
this
substantive
--
national
substantive
law
because
it
would
conflict
or
clash
with
the
erie
doctrine,
he
devised
a
doctrine
of
separability
of
the
causes
of
the
contract.
he
reasoned
that
congress
intended
or
referred
to
in
an
arbitration
act
as
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
that,
that
meant
the
very
clause.
through
this
reasoning
he
claimed
that
the
contract
to
arbitrate
was
separable
provision
and
therefore
if
you
do
not
allege
a
fraud
as
to
the
clause,
then
a
fraud
as
to
any
portion
of
the
agreement,
no
matter
what
materiality
it
had,
no
matter
what
the
reliances,
you
are
relegated
to
the
informal
tribunal
of
arbitration,
notwithstanding
the
contrary
state
law
which
judge
medina
recognized
at
that
time
at
1960
to
be
that
a
fraud
permeates
the
entire
agreement
and
a
fraud
as
to
any
other
portion
of
the
agreement
would
therefore
--
therefore
the
whole
agreement
would
fall
completely.
the
second
reasoning,
he
said
it
was
clearly
constitutional
and
the
petitioner
says
that
this
result
of
judge
medina's
which
conflicts
with
the
erie
principle
is
obviously
unconstitutional,
in
that
you
put
a
premium
on
the
fact
that
these
parties
were
of
diverse
citizenship
and
that
further
you
encourage
forum
shopping
and
all
the
resultant
wrongs
that
erie
sought
to
correct
and
third,
petitioner
asserts
that
judge
medina
notwithstanding
section
4
which
set
up
a
whole
procedure
for
a
preliminary
hearing
on
the
question
of
validity
of
contract
said
as
a
matter
of
law
and
we
feel
that
he
violated
the
whole
intent
of
congress
in
cutting
out
this
problem
of
a
hearing
effectively
the
only
hearing
you
can
have
under
judge
medina's
proposition
is
if
you
alleged
fraud
as
the
arbitration
clause,
you
don't
allege
any
such
fraud,
any
other
issues
for
the
arbitrators.
we
submit
that
judge
medina's
legal
reasoning
is
erroneous
and
conflict
with
--
except
to
constitutional
limitations
announced
by
this
court.
now
a
preliminary
question,
we
recognize
and
which
is
one
of
the
issues
here
is
that
in
order
for
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
apply
in
the
first
instance,
the
court
my
preliminarily
make
a
determination
that
the
contract
evidence
as
a
transaction
and
interstate
commerce
or
a
maritime
transaction
which
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
petitioner
maintains
that
this
contract
is
a
mere
employment
contract
and
the
contract
speaks
for
itself
and
for
that
reason,
i
will
not
venture
in
to
this
point,
i
think
the
briefs
are
adequate
on
it.
but
we
continue
to
say
and
we
move
to
the
second
proposition
assuming
this
court
were
to
find
that
this
case
is
not
four
squared
in
point
with
bernhardt
versus
polygraphic
company
of
the
united
states.
that
decision
of
1956
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas
held
that
section
3
was
not
to
be
construed
by
second
circuit
as
to
be
so
broad
as
to
reach
all
contracts
and
that
section
2
was
definition
on
its
scope
and
that
therefore
section
3
could
only
reach
those
contracts
defined
in
section
2.
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
douglas
specifically
pointed
out
that
we
hold
this
way
to
avoid
the
constitutional
implications.
we
hold
that
this
a
bernhardt
case,
it's
an
employment
contract
it's
not
a
transaction,
it's
not
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
in
interstate
commerce.
notwithstanding
that
if
the
contract
were
assumed
to
be
in
commerce
and
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
be
applicable,
we
feel
that
the
court
further
erred
below
in
concluding
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
created
national
substantive
law.
there
is
no
intent
of
congress
specified
in
this
act,
either
in
the
act
itself
or
in
any
of
the
sub-committee
hearings
and
in
the
writings
of
contemporary
authors.
in
fact,
quite
the
opposite,
the
hearings
in
the
congressional
record
allude
to
this
act
as
being
procedural
and
relating
to
the
law
of
remedy.
we
further
maintain
that
this
court
in
the
bernhardt
case
has
already
indicated
that
section
2
was
procedural,
when
it
said
it
was
definitional
in
scope.
we
further
point
out
to
the
court
that
all
the
other
sections
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
1
through
14,
i
should
say
3
through
14
are
procedural
in
all
of
their
application
and
could
not
possibly
be
legally
construed
to
have
an
substantive
effect.
we
therefore
feel
--
now
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
in
1924
just
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
the
court
passed
a
decision
down
on
this
red
cross
line
case
by
mr.
justice
brandeis,
in
that
case
mr.
brandeis
for
the
first
time
established
that
contracts
containing
arbitration
clauses
and
arbitration
agreements
themselves
were
valid
and
created
a
perfect
obligation.
in
1925,
we
believe
the
congress
relied
on
the
precedent
to
the
red
cross
case
and
therefore
when
congress
created
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
specifically
referred
to
in
section
2,
the
act
that
--
the
section
of
the
act
that
we
are
looking
at,
we
say
that
they
didn't
intend
to
create
substantive
rights
because
these
existed
because
of
the
red
cross
--
the
red
cross
line
case.
the
validity
of
a
contract
was
now
the
law
of
the
land;
we
therefore
say
that
congress
was
merely
roaring
a
procedural
statute
to
enforce
what
was
now
an
existing
right,
that
is
the
right
to
have
arbitration
contracts
recognized
as
valid
and
not
an
ouster
of
judicial
court
jurisdiction.
for
more
--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
that's
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes.
i
am.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
i
didn't
cite
it
in
the
reply
brief
but
i
know
it
is
distinguishable
as
are
the
other
cases,
when
the
facts
of
the
case
are
pierced
out.
appendix
a
to
the
reply
has
a
recent
1965
unpublished
opinion
by
judge
inzer
wyatt
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
which
all
these
cases
were
analyzed
by
the
district
judge.
the
only
case
cited
in
these
proceedings
by
the
circuit
court,
was
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
fabrics
and
judge
--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
that's
right,
the
only
new
york
case
and
judge
wayte
concludes
that
fabrics
if
not
distinguishable
then
the
decision
must
be
considered
with
great
--
that's
appendix
8a
in
the
reply
brief
your
honor.
it
says
the
fabrics
is
not
--
if
not
so
distinguishable
then
the
decision
must
be
considered
with
great
deference
to
be
wrong,
now
this
was
the
sole
new
york
case
relied
on--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
your
honor
but
to
get
you
--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
your
honor.
now
this
decision
of
wayte,
of
judge
wayte
goes
through
all
the
cases,
all
the
material
cases
and
stands
for
the
proposition
that
new
york
law
is
unchanged
and
still
is,
that
recession
for
fraud
vitiates
the
entire
agreement.
we
submit
that
the
amphenol
case
is
not
distinguishable
your
honor
is
certainly
not
the
law
as
an
inferior
court
decision
it's
only
an
appellate
provision.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yeah,
but
the
highest
court
here
is
the
court
of
appeals
which
has
annunciated
the
(inaudible)
which
is
discussed
at
length
in
judge
wyatt
decision
which
is
a
part
of
the
appendix
and
we
say
that
this
court,
the
federal
courts
must
look
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
order
to
determine
what
its
precedent
is.
it
maybe
and
this
is
to
be
conceded,
it
may
be
the
new
york
law
is
slowly
changing,
this
court
even
changes
the
law,
but
at
the
present
time
and
in
the
context
of
this
case,
new
york
law
is
contrary.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well,
the
petitioner
relies
on
the
analysis
of
(inaudible)
which
judge
waytt
sets
forth
there.
it
was
a
3:4
decision,
but
he
has
a
very
incisive
analyzation
of
that
case
and
shows
that
the
action
can
be
practically
considered
--
the
decision
can
be
practically
considered
a
unanimous
decision
because
addictive
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
there
may
be
your
honor,
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
lawrence
case
which
is
the
precedent,
here
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
revoke
or
overturn
in
1960
judge
medina
admitted
in
the
record
in
the
decision
that
new
york
law
was
contrary
and
use
that
as
an
assumption
arriving
at
its
decision.
the
petitioner
maintains
that
if
you
look
at
all
this
procedural
discussion,
the
intent
of
the
congress,
the
hearings,
the
writers,
the
fact
that
the
legislation
originated
out
of
the
judiciary
committees
of
both
houses
obviously
perhaps
article
3
legislation,
although
article
1
may
have
been
used
for
the
commerce,
course
used
to
buttress
this
legislation
and
thus
give
it
a
broader
legislative
base.
if
you
read
bernhardt
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
other
sections
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
plus
a
red
cross
line,
we
conclude
that
it's
only
susceptible
of
one
conclusion
that
this
act
is
procedural
in
it's
application
where
diversity
of
citizenship
applies.
even
though
the
act
evidences
a
contract
in
interstate
commerce.
by
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
court
again
avoids
any
constitutional
problem
that
erie
would
present.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
i
believe
only
three
or
four
had
arbitration
acts
new
jersey,
new
york
and
perhaps
one
of
them.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
no,
your
honor
the
arbitration
act
that
congress
passed
was
patented
on
the
new
york
act
which
had
been
passed
five
years
earlier.
the
new
york
courts
have
characterized
the
act
when
it
was
being
constitutional
and
the
cases
cited,
--
slip
my
mind
at
any
rate
that
the
act
was
remedial
on
its
application
and
procedure.
congress
now
passed
this
act
under
the
sponsorship
of
the
american
bar
association
in
an
attempt
to
try
and
permit
citizens
in
the
various
states
to
have
the
same
procedural
remedies
that
the
states
returning
to
these
are
regular
tribunals
of
arbitration
and
particularly
and
it
was
more
important
in
the
commercial
centers
of
this
country.
arbitration,
if
you
look
at
the
expansion
of
it
expanded
sort
of
west,
its
thoughts
in
the
urban
centers
and
then
goes
throughout
the
country.
so
new
york
possibly
being
a
principle
urban
center
and
new
jersey
and
various
other
states
rapidly
fell
into
law
and
passing
arbitration
acts
at
the
insistence
of
their
citizens
for
whatever
commercial
needs
they
needed.
and
congress
was
persuaded
of
course
to
undertake
similar
legislations
so
there
would
be
problem
--
pardon
me
no
problem
in
the
federal
court
coming
up
with
perhaps
different
results.
we
say
congress
even
recognized
there
that
in
a
sense
to
have
different
system
of
procedure
might
work
wrongs
but
we
say
it
was
procedural,
and
it's
wholly
procedure
and
even
judge
medina
in
the
lawrence
case
and
the
other
lower
courts
have
held
that
the
federal
arbitration
has
independent
federal
basis
for
jurisdiction
and
this
is
essentially
the
erie
problem,
we're
coming
to
because
if
you
hold
it
substantive
and
apply
erie
and
new
york
and
oregon
the
cases
involving
procedure
certain
parts
of
the
procedural
laws
can
have
substantive
outcome
on
a
litigation.
we
are
going
to
find
a
situation
where
the
opposite
of
erie
occurs.
it's
not
the
fact
that
you
are
diverse
citizen
that
works
so
wrong,
it's
the
fact
that
the
contract
is
between
citizens
of
the
same
states,
the
new
two
new
yorkers
that
have
an
that
have
arbitration
and
fraud
will
vitiate
it
have
a
different
result.
a
hypothetical
would
be,
if
i
contract
with
my
opponent
here
to
ship
interstate
goods
to
california
and
it's
under
$10,000,
there
is
no
independent
right
to
get
into
court
and
we
arbitrate
and
an
attempt
to
arbitrate
is
made
in
new
york,
i
have
worked
in
new
york
law
to
my
favor
and
the
contract
falls
under
current
law.
but
if
we
were
diverse
citizens,
if
he
was
a
jersey
resident
we
could
then
forum
shop
and
pick
our
court,
go
into
the
federal
court
and
a
different
result
would
follow
if
you
follow
judge
medina's
lawrence
holding.
therefore
we
say
the
proper
rule
of
law
to
apply
to
this
type
of
litigation
is
a
rule
of
common
law
or
the
state
common
law
that
fraud
vitiates
the
entire
agreement.
now,
we
say
the
congress
intended
to
because
they
saved
this
in
section
2
of
the
act.
the
section
says
that
arbitration
agreements
are
valid
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exist
at
lower
end
equity
for
the
revocation
there
of.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
i
would
say
that,
that
is
a
policy
of
the
state
and
its
citizens
to
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
i
would
say
that
the
federal
court
should
apply
the
state
law
because
--
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
that's
correct
your
honor
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
applying
the
common
law
of
the
state
can
possibly
be
considered
invidious
restraint
on
interstate
commerce,
if
we
the
commerce
–-
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well,
i
think
congress
may
have
but
they
didn't
intend
it,
when
they
framed
this
act.
the
act
is
not
as
drafted
as
to
permit.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well
that
means
that
they
are
revocable
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
well,
i
should
say
that
they
are
not
revocable
that
they
are
valid
and
i
say
that
the
state
court
that
the
federal
court
sitting
in
such
a
situation
your
honor,
must
find
it
must
apply
the
state
law
and
then
perhaps
in
those
cases
a
policy
decision
what
we
have
to
be
made
as
to
whether
the
contract
is
to
be
deemed
valid
because
of
the
commerce
powers
or
the
powers
the
congress
to
regulate
contracts
touching
on
these
or
to
determine
that
this
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
legislate
into
this
area
and
to
deem
it
that
the
state
law
to
apply
and
the
contract
will
thus
be
move
forward
as
far
as
the
arbitration
cause
concerned.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well,
i
would
say
if
you
are
going
to
find
a
constitutional
basis
that
it
was
article
1
the
commerce
clause,
and
that
the
act
was
then
substantive,
you
than
run
into
the
erie
doctrine
in
where
you
are
going
to
have
the
situation
that
non
citizens
are
going
to
have
a
different
result
as
opposed
to
litigation
involving
diversity
of
citizens.
and
so
i
think
it's
equally
objectionable.
further
than
that
you
have
to
find
a
preemption
of
the
act
and
you're
going
to
have
to
enforce
this
unique
separability
doctrine
that
judge
medina
imposed
and
thus
throw
out
the
whole
concept
of
the
intrical
nature
of
a
contract.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
well,
with
the
preemption
doctrine
your
honor
you
could
then
claim
that
the
court
could
then
find
that
the
state
law
was
preempted
to
the
extent
of
the
federalization
of
the
arbitration
and
that
thus
the
contract,
the
arbitration
clause
itself
was
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
i
think
so
there
is
no
national
policy
involved
sir
in
this
case,
lincoln
mills
and
the
other
cases
will
come
under
the
nlra
and
the
labor
acts
in
which
there
was
a
strong
national
policy.
here
the
only,
there
is
no
restraint
on
commerce
being
imposed.
mr.
robert
p.
herzog
yes,
but
we
still
feel
that
there
was
that
the
rational
differences
that
there
is
a
concurrent
power
here
between
the
state
congress
and
arbitration
didn't
want
to
outlaw
all
interstate,
all
state
contacts
with
commerce
--
they
just
wanted
to
prevent
restrains
that
would
impede
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
we
don't
see
how
this
policy
of
holding
the
federal
act
that
the
state
law
is
applicable
can
be
considered
impeding
of
commerce.
it's
merely
relegating
you
to
a
court
either
a
court
in
the
first
instance
to
the
try
the
issue
of
fraud
or
the
arbitrators
and
we
feel
that
the
substantial
difference
between
arbitration
and
a
court
of
law
should
have
this
preliminary
threshold
question,
the
existence,
the
meeting
of
a
mind,
there
certainly
can't
be
an
arbitration
contract
if
there
is
no
meeting
of
the
mind.
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
