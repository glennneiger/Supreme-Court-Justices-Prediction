mr.
martin
a.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
the
question
before
this
court
is
one
of
congressional
intent,
did
congress
intend
to
enact
a
national
law
of
governing
arbitration
agreements
in
contracts
involving
interstate
commerce.
if
this
court
finds
affirmatively
on
that
question,
we've
then
reached
a
second
question
as
to
whether
the
second
circuit
properly
applied
the
national
law.
we
submit
that
the
approach
taken
to
the
problem
by
the
second
circuit
is
the
correct
approach.
congress
endorsed
the
policy
of
arbitration,
it
spoke,
it
wanted
to
make
arbitration
available
for
the
businessman
who
simply
cannot
afford
the
delays
and
the
expense
which
litigation
afford
him.
whether
we
like
it
or
not
the
commercial
litigation
these
days
is
the
luxury
for
the
wealthy.
a
small
businessman
needs
speed
and
he
cannot
afford
the
money
or
the
time
for
the
lengthy
litigation
process.
congress
recognized
this,
it
made
arbitration
available.
section
2
of
the
act
speaks
to
interstate
commerce
and
admiralty.
in
other
words
it
speaks
to
the
full
substantive
powers
of
congress
in
those
areas
and
only
in
those
areas.
congress
said
that
arbitration
agreements
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas
as
to
whether
the
result
of
this
case
might
or
might
not
be
the
same
in
new
york
law,
we
believe
there
is
a
conflict,
but
we
believe
--
we
believe
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
decisions
but
the
latest
decision
which
is
affirmance
by
the
appellate
division
would
seem
to
indicate
that
new
york
state
law
would
send
this
matter
to
arbitration.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes
sir,
but
i
submit
that
that's
irrelevant,
because
had
this
case
come
out
of
the
state
of
vermont
which
as
this
court
found
in
bernhardt
would
not
have
sent
it
to
arbitration.
the
matter
should
still
go
to
arbitration,
it's
--
in
other
words
its
federal
law
that
the
court
looks
to,
not
the
state
court.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
your
honor
that's
exactly
right,
and
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
granting
of
certiorari
in
this
case
we
pointed
that
out.
that
in
this
particular
case,
we
think
it
is
an
argument
about
nothing.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
certainly,
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
yet
spoken.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
is
correct,
well
they
clearly
haven't
spoken
the
other
way,
it
spoke
to
an
arbitration
agreement
which
was
not
nearly
as
to
this
point.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
and
it's
under
that
arbitration
agreement,
the
parties
did
not
agree
to
sent
through
it
to
the
arbitrator,
that's
what
it
said.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
since
robert
lawrence
was
decided
the
third
circuit
explicitly
endorsed
it,
the
fifth
circuit
endorsed
it
although
they
endorsed
it
in
a
case
which
was
then
reversed
by
this
court
on
other
grounds,
that's
the
mosley
case.
in
mosley,
this
court
found
that
the
fraud
went
to
the
arbitration
agreement
itself.
if
it
did
not
the
fifth
circuit
would
have
followed
this.
the
sixth
circuit
we
believe
supports
the
exact
same
result.
the
sixth
circuit
in
american
airlines
which
came
down
three
or
four
weeks
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
since
the
decision
in
robert
lawrence
came
down
in
1959
the
first
circuit
questioned
it
in
a
case
where
it
really
didn't
matter
because
they
sent
the
matter
to
arbitration
anyway.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
ninth
circuit
has
not
spoken
since
robert
lawrence
your
honor.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
and
the
lower
courts,
the
federal
district
court
throughout
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes,
well,
yes
that
is
correct
when
robert
lawrence
was
granted
the
ninth
circuit
had
previously
said
that
they
were
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
they
never
--
apparently,
they
never
had
another
case
dealing
with
the
question
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
and
the
ninth
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
i
might
point
out
however
that
when
the
ninth
circuit
decided
to
apply
california
law,
again
it
really
didn't
matter
because
california
does
have
an
arbitration
statute.
so
that
it
wasn't
the
situation
where
the
question
was
do
you
go
to
arbitration
under
federal
law
or
don't
you
under
state
law.
i
don't
think
that
they
gave
the
matter
indifference
as
much
consideration
as
they
should
have.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
only
way
you
get
into
federal
court
is
under
title
28
which
includes
of
course
diversity
of
citizenship.
if
there
is
no
diversity
and
if
you
are
not
in
federal
court
for
other
reason
such
as
a
federal
contract
you
do
not
get
into
the
federal
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
you
mean
in
order
to
get
into
federal
court,
well
if
i
may
answer
you
in
a
roundabout
way,
i
like
to
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no,
section
4
of
the
act,
which
is
the
section
that
allows
a
federal
court
to
order
arbitration,
seems
to
state
quite
clearly
that
you
need
grounds
other
than
the
arbitration
act
to
get
into
the
federal
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
meets
our
problem.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that's
exactly
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes
sir,
we
say
we
could
have
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
problem
of
forum
shopping
because
the
state
courts
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
this
is
definitely
our
contention
that
the
state
courts
will
now
have
to
apply
this
federal
law
because
congress
exercised
its
commerce
power
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
exactly,
exactly.
now,
the
problems
in
this
case
are
problems
which
come
about
because
we
have
a
statute
enacted
in
1925
long
before
congress
or
anyone
else
thought
about
hearing.
the
act
however
was
clearly
intended
to
apply
to
diversity
cases
in
the
federal
court.
section
2
of
the
act
in
making
all
agreements
to
arbitrate
in
contracts
involving
interstate
commerce
valid,
irrevocable,
enforceable
provides
for
no
exceptions
to
that,
all
agreements.
what
little
legislative
history
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes,
sir,
we
do
mention
this
in
our
brief.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
we
really
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
mr.
justice
douglas
we
do
not
argue
that
we
have
an
employment
contract
here,
this
is
a
characterization
put
on
the
contract
by
petitioner
not
by
us.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir,
because
this
is
not
an
employment
contract
we
have,
what
we
have
here
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
distinction
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
all
right
in
my
case
i
filled
assets
and
those
assets
were
located
in
number
of
the
states,
those
assets
were
the
lists
of
my
customers.
i
agreed
to
give
consulting
services
in
transferring
the
servicing
of
those
assets
from
new
jersey
to
baltimore,
maryland.
now
the
second
circuit
in
their
opinion
said
that
beyond
her
adventure,
this
is
a
contract
involving
interstate
commerce.
after
all
we
did
have
customer
lists
in
many,
many
states.
the
record
doesn't
indicate
how
many,
it
just
said
several
states
and
then
we
sold
them.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir
it
did
not.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir
it
does
not.
this
is
a
fully
–-
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
but
i
would
hope
it's
not.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
however,
however
here
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
your
honor
i
believe
you
are
referring
to
this
national
equipment
rental
case
of
this
court
two
or
three
years
ago.
but
that
is
not
our
situation
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
that
was
the
law
of
this
court
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
national
equipment
rental
case
your
honor
is
a
case
of
this
court
in
1964,
where
in
a
5:4
decision,
the
court
upheld
a
clause
in
a
form
contract
where
a
michigan
farmer
authorized
somebody
in
new
york
to
accept
service
for
him
for
a
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that's
correct,
that
is
a
holding
of
this
court
in
a
five
to
four
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir,
no
sir
that
was
not
under
arbitration
law
that
was
to
avail
oneself
of
the
courts
of
new
york.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
was
not
an
arbitration,
it
was
litigation.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
i
don't
know
of
that
your
honor,
i
would
say,
i
would
say
if
they
did,
i
wouldn't
be
happy
with
it.
i
think
that
if
a
party
agrees
to
arbitrate
he
has
to
agree
knowingly,
willingly
he
has
to
know
exactly
what
he
is
doing.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
that
would
be
taking
away
a
person's
right
to,
i
think
they
would
be
denying
a
person
a
constitutional
right
to
go
to
court.
nobody,
nobody
has
to
arbitrate
unless
he
agreed
to
and
then
that
i
think
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
--
now
this
is
a
big
step,
if
you
have
not
agreed
to
arbitrate
or
if
you
can
even
say
i
didn't
even
know
the
clause
was
in
the
contract
and
if
you
can
demonstrate
that,
then
t
we
would
have
a
different
case,
but
we
have
a
case
where
we
had
attorneys
on
both
sides,
we
had
a
fully
negotiated
contract
when
we
got
to
the
arbitration
clause,
we
took
the
broadest
clause
known
to
the
bar
and
then
we
made
changes
in
the
clause.
we
made
changes
to
provide
before
whom
the
arbitration
would
be,
so
that
at
least
one
of
the
arbitrators
must
be
an
attorney,
another
must
be
an
accountant
where
we
tampered
with
the
clause
to
provide
that
the
costs
of
arbitration
would
be
shared
equally
no
matter
what
the
arbitrators
did.
when
we
agreed
to
arbitrate,
we
knew
precisely
what
we
were
doing.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
is
correct,
that
was
the
common
law
here,
the
common
law
for
as
far
as
i
know
from
the
ancient
days
before
this
republic
had
a
hostility
to
arbitration
on
the
theory
that
it
divested
the
courts
of
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
which
it
does
and
the
common
law
in
the
few
states
today
which
do
not
have
arbitration
statutes
is
still
that
way.
but
congress
passed
this
statute
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
and
in
the
statute.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
statute—
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
erie
did
not
speak
to
this
statute
to
the
arbitration.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
congressional
enactment.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
arbitration
has
to
my
knowledge
which
maybe
incomplete
as
to
my
knowledge
never
been
challenged
as
unconstitutional.
the
new
york
statute
when
that
was
enacted
in
1920
was
challenged
in
the
new
york
courts
as
unconstitutional
and
the
new
york
courts
upheld
it
because,
because
the
important
thing
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
with
arbitration
is
that
it's
entirely
voluntary,
if
you
don't
want
to
arbitrate,
you
don't
have
to
arbitrate.
but
once
you've
agreed
to
arbitrate
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
is
right,
well,
if
you
first
have
to
wait
for
a
dispute
to
arise
before
you
agreed
on
whether
or
not
you
will
arbitrate
it
is
usually
to
the
advantage
of
one
party,
not
to
arbitrate
because
he
is
in
no
hurry
for
a
quick
result.
arbitration
to
have
any
effectiveness
must
make
agreements
to
arbitrate
future
disputes
irrevocable
and
the
point
is
that
congress
did
this,
the
act,
the
act
couldn't
be
clearer,
section
2--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
and
i
do
not
believe
that
in
this
case
we
are
challenging
the
act
as
unconstitutional,
petitioner
argues
that
the
act
runs
up
against
erie
problems
we
don't
believe
it
does.
we
don't
believe
it
does
because
the
act
was
clearly
intended
to
apply
to
diversity
cases
that's
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
that's
in
the
law
review
articles
written
at
that
time
by
attorneys
who
are
members
of
committees
which
sponsored
the
act
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes
sir.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
i
don't
believe,
no
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
we
couldn't
get
into
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
so
you
need
to
see
any
two
things,
you
need
the
arbitration
agreement
or
you
need
three
things,
you
need
the
arbitration
agreement,
you
need
a
contract
in
interstate
commerce
and
you
need
diversity
of
citizenship
to
get
into
the
federal
court,
without
the
diversity
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
is
correct.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
absolutely.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
there
you
are
your
honor,
you
have
with
arbitration
--
you
have
something--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
quite
unique.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
i
don't,
--
i
frankly
don't
think
the
congress
when
it
passed
this
law
gave
–
thought
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
its
applications
to
the
state.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir,
i
know
of
no
reason.
your
honor,
in
my
few
remaining
minutes
i
have
agreed
to
yield
them
to
mr.
aksen
of
the
american
arbitration
association
who
is
here
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
the
question
before
this
court
is
one
of
congressional
intent,
did
congress
intend
to
enact
a
national
law
of
governing
arbitration
agreements
in
contracts
involving
interstate
commerce.
if
this
court
finds
affirmatively
on
that
question,
we've
then
reached
a
second
question
as
to
whether
the
second
circuit
properly
applied
the
national
law.
we
submit
that
the
approach
taken
to
the
problem
by
the
second
circuit
is
the
correct
approach.
congress
endorsed
the
policy
of
arbitration,
it
spoke,
it
wanted
to
make
arbitration
available
for
the
businessman
who
simply
cannot
afford
the
delays
and
the
expense
which
litigation
afford
him.
whether
we
like
it
or
not
the
commercial
litigation
these
days
is
the
luxury
for
the
wealthy.
a
small
businessman
needs
speed
and
he
cannot
afford
the
money
or
the
time
for
the
lengthy
litigation
process.
congress
recognized
this,
it
made
arbitration
available.
section
2
of
the
act
speaks
to
interstate
commerce
and
admiralty.
in
other
words
it
speaks
to
the
full
substantive
powers
of
congress
in
those
areas
and
only
in
those
areas.
congress
said
that
arbitration
agreements
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas
as
to
whether
the
result
of
this
case
might
or
might
not
be
the
same
in
new
york
law,
we
believe
there
is
a
conflict,
but
we
believe
--
we
believe
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
decisions
but
the
latest
decision
which
is
affirmance
by
the
appellate
division
would
seem
to
indicate
that
new
york
state
law
would
send
this
matter
to
arbitration.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes
sir,
but
i
submit
that
that's
irrelevant,
because
had
this
case
come
out
of
the
state
of
vermont
which
as
this
court
found
in
bernhardt
would
not
have
sent
it
to
arbitration.
the
matter
should
still
go
to
arbitration,
it's
--
in
other
words
its
federal
law
that
the
court
looks
to,
not
the
state
court.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
your
honor
that's
exactly
right,
and
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
granting
of
certiorari
in
this
case
we
pointed
that
out.
that
in
this
particular
case,
we
think
it
is
an
argument
about
nothing.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
certainly,
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
yet
spoken.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
is
correct,
well
they
clearly
haven't
spoken
the
other
way,
it
spoke
to
an
arbitration
agreement
which
was
not
nearly
as
to
this
point.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
and
it's
under
that
arbitration
agreement,
the
parties
did
not
agree
to
sent
through
it
to
the
arbitrator,
that's
what
it
said.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
since
robert
lawrence
was
decided
the
third
circuit
explicitly
endorsed
it,
the
fifth
circuit
endorsed
it
although
they
endorsed
it
in
a
case
which
was
then
reversed
by
this
court
on
other
grounds,
that's
the
mosley
case.
in
mosley,
this
court
found
that
the
fraud
went
to
the
arbitration
agreement
itself.
if
it
did
not
the
fifth
circuit
would
have
followed
this.
the
sixth
circuit
we
believe
supports
the
exact
same
result.
the
sixth
circuit
in
american
airlines
which
came
down
three
or
four
weeks
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
since
the
decision
in
robert
lawrence
came
down
in
1959
the
first
circuit
questioned
it
in
a
case
where
it
really
didn't
matter
because
they
sent
the
matter
to
arbitration
anyway.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
ninth
circuit
has
not
spoken
since
robert
lawrence
your
honor.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
and
the
lower
courts,
the
federal
district
court
throughout
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes,
well,
yes
that
is
correct
when
robert
lawrence
was
granted
the
ninth
circuit
had
previously
said
that
they
were
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
they
never
--
apparently,
they
never
had
another
case
dealing
with
the
question
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
and
the
ninth
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
i
might
point
out
however
that
when
the
ninth
circuit
decided
to
apply
california
law,
again
it
really
didn't
matter
because
california
does
have
an
arbitration
statute.
so
that
it
wasn't
the
situation
where
the
question
was
do
you
go
to
arbitration
under
federal
law
or
don't
you
under
state
law.
i
don't
think
that
they
gave
the
matter
indifference
as
much
consideration
as
they
should
have.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
only
way
you
get
into
federal
court
is
under
title
28
which
includes
of
course
diversity
of
citizenship.
if
there
is
no
diversity
and
if
you
are
not
in
federal
court
for
other
reason
such
as
a
federal
contract
you
do
not
get
into
the
federal
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
you
mean
in
order
to
get
into
federal
court,
well
if
i
may
answer
you
in
a
roundabout
way,
i
like
to
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no,
section
4
of
the
act,
which
is
the
section
that
allows
a
federal
court
to
order
arbitration,
seems
to
state
quite
clearly
that
you
need
grounds
other
than
the
arbitration
act
to
get
into
the
federal
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
meets
our
problem.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that's
exactly
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes
sir,
we
say
we
could
have
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
problem
of
forum
shopping
because
the
state
courts
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
this
is
definitely
our
contention
that
the
state
courts
will
now
have
to
apply
this
federal
law
because
congress
exercised
its
commerce
power
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
exactly,
exactly.
now,
the
problems
in
this
case
are
problems
which
come
about
because
we
have
a
statute
enacted
in
1925
long
before
congress
or
anyone
else
thought
about
hearing.
the
act
however
was
clearly
intended
to
apply
to
diversity
cases
in
the
federal
court.
section
2
of
the
act
in
making
all
agreements
to
arbitrate
in
contracts
involving
interstate
commerce
valid,
irrevocable,
enforceable
provides
for
no
exceptions
to
that,
all
agreements.
what
little
legislative
history
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes,
sir,
we
do
mention
this
in
our
brief.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
we
really
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
mr.
justice
douglas
we
do
not
argue
that
we
have
an
employment
contract
here,
this
is
a
characterization
put
on
the
contract
by
petitioner
not
by
us.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir,
because
this
is
not
an
employment
contract
we
have,
what
we
have
here
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
distinction
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
all
right
in
my
case
i
filled
assets
and
those
assets
were
located
in
number
of
the
states,
those
assets
were
the
lists
of
my
customers.
i
agreed
to
give
consulting
services
in
transferring
the
servicing
of
those
assets
from
new
jersey
to
baltimore,
maryland.
now
the
second
circuit
in
their
opinion
said
that
beyond
her
adventure,
this
is
a
contract
involving
interstate
commerce.
after
all
we
did
have
customer
lists
in
many,
many
states.
the
record
doesn't
indicate
how
many,
it
just
said
several
states
and
then
we
sold
them.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir
it
did
not.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir
it
does
not.
this
is
a
fully
–-
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
but
i
would
hope
it's
not.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
however,
however
here
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
your
honor
i
believe
you
are
referring
to
this
national
equipment
rental
case
of
this
court
two
or
three
years
ago.
but
that
is
not
our
situation
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
that
was
the
law
of
this
court
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
national
equipment
rental
case
your
honor
is
a
case
of
this
court
in
1964,
where
in
a
5:4
decision,
the
court
upheld
a
clause
in
a
form
contract
where
a
michigan
farmer
authorized
somebody
in
new
york
to
accept
service
for
him
for
a
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that's
correct,
that
is
a
holding
of
this
court
in
a
five
to
four
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir,
no
sir
that
was
not
under
arbitration
law
that
was
to
avail
oneself
of
the
courts
of
new
york.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
was
not
an
arbitration,
it
was
litigation.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
i
don't
know
of
that
your
honor,
i
would
say,
i
would
say
if
they
did,
i
wouldn't
be
happy
with
it.
i
think
that
if
a
party
agrees
to
arbitrate
he
has
to
agree
knowingly,
willingly
he
has
to
know
exactly
what
he
is
doing.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
that
would
be
taking
away
a
person's
right
to,
i
think
they
would
be
denying
a
person
a
constitutional
right
to
go
to
court.
nobody,
nobody
has
to
arbitrate
unless
he
agreed
to
and
then
that
i
think
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
--
now
this
is
a
big
step,
if
you
have
not
agreed
to
arbitrate
or
if
you
can
even
say
i
didn't
even
know
the
clause
was
in
the
contract
and
if
you
can
demonstrate
that,
then
t
we
would
have
a
different
case,
but
we
have
a
case
where
we
had
attorneys
on
both
sides,
we
had
a
fully
negotiated
contract
when
we
got
to
the
arbitration
clause,
we
took
the
broadest
clause
known
to
the
bar
and
then
we
made
changes
in
the
clause.
we
made
changes
to
provide
before
whom
the
arbitration
would
be,
so
that
at
least
one
of
the
arbitrators
must
be
an
attorney,
another
must
be
an
accountant
where
we
tampered
with
the
clause
to
provide
that
the
costs
of
arbitration
would
be
shared
equally
no
matter
what
the
arbitrators
did.
when
we
agreed
to
arbitrate,
we
knew
precisely
what
we
were
doing.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
is
correct,
that
was
the
common
law
here,
the
common
law
for
as
far
as
i
know
from
the
ancient
days
before
this
republic
had
a
hostility
to
arbitration
on
the
theory
that
it
divested
the
courts
of
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
which
it
does
and
the
common
law
in
the
few
states
today
which
do
not
have
arbitration
statutes
is
still
that
way.
but
congress
passed
this
statute
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
and
in
the
statute.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
statute—
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
erie
did
not
speak
to
this
statute
to
the
arbitration.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
the
congressional
enactment.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
arbitration
has
to
my
knowledge
which
maybe
incomplete
as
to
my
knowledge
never
been
challenged
as
unconstitutional.
the
new
york
statute
when
that
was
enacted
in
1920
was
challenged
in
the
new
york
courts
as
unconstitutional
and
the
new
york
courts
upheld
it
because,
because
the
important
thing
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
with
arbitration
is
that
it's
entirely
voluntary,
if
you
don't
want
to
arbitrate,
you
don't
have
to
arbitrate.
but
once
you've
agreed
to
arbitrate
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
is
right,
well,
if
you
first
have
to
wait
for
a
dispute
to
arise
before
you
agreed
on
whether
or
not
you
will
arbitrate
it
is
usually
to
the
advantage
of
one
party,
not
to
arbitrate
because
he
is
in
no
hurry
for
a
quick
result.
arbitration
to
have
any
effectiveness
must
make
agreements
to
arbitrate
future
disputes
irrevocable
and
the
point
is
that
congress
did
this,
the
act,
the
act
couldn't
be
clearer,
section
2--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
and
i
do
not
believe
that
in
this
case
we
are
challenging
the
act
as
unconstitutional,
petitioner
argues
that
the
act
runs
up
against
erie
problems
we
don't
believe
it
does.
we
don't
believe
it
does
because
the
act
was
clearly
intended
to
apply
to
diversity
cases
that's
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
that's
in
the
law
review
articles
written
at
that
time
by
attorneys
who
are
members
of
committees
which
sponsored
the
act
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
yes
sir.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
i
don't
believe,
no
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
we
couldn't
get
into
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
so
you
need
to
see
any
two
things,
you
need
the
arbitration
agreement
or
you
need
three
things,
you
need
the
arbitration
agreement,
you
need
a
contract
in
interstate
commerce
and
you
need
diversity
of
citizenship
to
get
into
the
federal
court,
without
the
diversity
--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
that
is
correct.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
absolutely.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
there
you
are
your
honor,
you
have
with
arbitration
--
you
have
something--
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
quite
unique.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
well,
i
don't,
--
i
frankly
don't
think
the
congress
when
it
passed
this
law
gave
–
thought
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
its
applications
to
the
state.
mr.
martin
a.
coleman
no
sir,
i
know
of
no
reason.
your
honor,
in
my
few
remaining
minutes
i
have
agreed
to
yield
them
to
mr.
aksen
of
the
american
arbitration
association
who
is
here
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
court.
thank
you
very
much.
