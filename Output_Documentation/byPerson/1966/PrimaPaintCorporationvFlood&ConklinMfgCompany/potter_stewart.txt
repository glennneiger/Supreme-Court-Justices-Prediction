justice
potter
stewart
yeah
but
that's
--
you
would
concede
that
is
not
crystal
clear,
the
law
of
new
york
is
not
crystal
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
spoken,
it's
spoken
the
other
way.
justice
potter
stewart
of
a
different
time.
justice
potter
stewart
the
suit
they
brought
against
you
in
the
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
certainly
fair
--
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
have
gone
into
the
state
courts
and
asked
it
on
the
basis
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
compliments
to
what
we
have
held
is
the
case
of
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
tell
me
mr.
coleman,
as
you
said
earlier
that
you
couldn't
get
into
federal
court
really
on
the
basis
that
the
act
itself,
i
gather
that's
because
of
that
phrase
that
is
section
4,
say
for
such
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that,
is
that
tied
against
your
proposition?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
that
clause
mean?
you
couldn't
get
into
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
without
an
agreement
--
without
an
arbitration
given
to
this
context.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
context
you
can't
get
in
without--
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
the
congress
say,
if
this,
if
i
think
we
have
already
--
we
have
positioned
it
that
this
creates
a
federal
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
it's
a
right
that
has
to
be
applied
by
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
you
conceive
that
because
of
this
language
you
can't
get
into
the
federal
court
merely
on
that
basis
to
enforce
that
federal
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
did
congress
do
that?
why
would
congress
have
created
a
federal
right
of
a
substantive
nature
and
enforceable
in
a
state
court
and
yet
not
based
on
the
agreement
itself
enforceable
to
the
federal
law?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any,
is
there
any
history
why
that's
safe
with
agreement
--?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
aksen,
can
you
enlighten
us
on
how
come
they're
saying
for
this
agreement
language
in
section
4?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is?
justice
potter
stewart
your
position
is
then
that
the
court
around
the
country
including
the
state
courts
should
sanction
a,
fashioned
law
with
respect
to
commercial
arbitration
without
any
particular
legislative
guidance
or
anything
else
except
that
the
arbitration
agreements
are
enforceable
and
the
court
should
enforce
them
in
accordance
to
the
rule
they
make
or
what?
