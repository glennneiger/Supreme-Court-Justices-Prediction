justice
abe
fortas
this
was
a
masculine
person.
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
a
crowd
of
all
speaking
together,
was
it?
and
they
say
the
words
in
separate
crowds
of
the
different
individuals
here.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
objection
made
by
that?
justice
abe
fortas
now
this
statute
does
have
some
element
of
the
intent
as
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
was
any
point
raised
about
the
necessity
of
proof
of
the
intent
as
to
each
of
the
individuals?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
question
here
as
to
whether
intent
has
to
be
particularized
as
to
the
individual
defendants
that
may
explain
what
i
have
in
mind
and
for
mind
by
saying
but
suppose
there
was
this
group
150?
justice
abe
fortas
two
hundred?
and
let's
suppose
that
some
of
them
had
the
intention
of
breaking
into
the
jail
in
the
morning.
is
there
a
question
as
to
whether
that
intent
could
be
attributed
to
the
entire
group
without
proof
of
knowledge
or
whether
proof
of
knowledge
would
be
necessary,
whether
proof
of
the
--
that
the
intent
was
the
intent
of
each
one
of
the
defendants?
justice
abe
fortas
all
or
each?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
knowledge
that
there
was
–
that
some
of
the
individuals
had
that
intent
and
then
having
made
that
raised
any
question
as
to
whether
mere
knowledge
would
result
in
--
would
support
attribution
of
the
intent
necessary
to
statutory
violation
to
the
others?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
could
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
supposed
200
school
children,
let's
say
high
school
children,
and
this
happen
to
congregate
there,
part
for
many
question
of
purpose
reason
or
whatnot,
same
place,
in
our
opinion,
would
that
have
been
a
trespass?
justice
abe
fortas
and
no
--
no
particular
--
no
permission,
expressed
permission,
they
just
come
by.
would
that
have
been
a
trespass
under
your
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
they
would
have
been
subject
to
prosecution?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
was
a
public
place?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
public
was
invited
that
was
part
of
the
public
property?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
200
high
school
children
congregated
in
a
park,
that
would
not
be
a
trespass
when
it
is
a
public
park.
justice
abe
fortas
and
suppose
200
children
gathered
on
the
driveway
on
mister.
i
don't
mean
the
driveway,
i
mean
the
parking
area
near
the
jail,
would
that
have
been
a
trespass?
you
see
what
i'm
getting
at
is
what
this,
this
is
public
property
and
the
public
presumably
is
invited
for
some
purposes.
now,
what
is
it
here
that
converts
us
into
a
trespass
in
your
view
of
the
case
in
that
two
elements
of
trespass
under
that
statute
aren't
correct?
what
is
going
on
the
property
without
permission
and
they
have
the
same
sort
of
specific
intent?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
now
what
is
it
that
converts
the
public
utilization
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
public
property?
what
is
it
that
converts
such
utilization
into
a
trespass
in
your
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
so
they
couldn't
charge
you
with
trespass.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
that's
right
for
me;
i
must
invite
you
to
be
very
specific.
it
would
become
a
trespass
when
these
people
said
that
they
were
there
for
the
purpose
of
protest.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
assume
which
you
may
not,
but
if
you
do
assume
that
it
wasn't
for
mere
presence
of
these
people
at
this
particular
place
should
constitute
a
trespass.
but
if
there
was
something
else
that
converted
their
presence
into
a
trespass
on
your
statute,
i'm
inviting
you
to
tell
us
precisely
what
it
was
that
converted
this
presence
of
these
people
into
a
violation
of
law
under
your
trespass
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
they
move
back
two
feet?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
mean
or
worse
for
the
petitioners
in
your
view
of
the
case
here.
that
is
same
cox
was
--
what
will
i
say,
“carrying
on”
these
orders
in
approaching
this
order.
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
it,
i
take
it?
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
a
masculine
person.
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
a
crowd
of
all
speaking
together,
was
it?
and
they
say
the
words
in
separate
crowds
of
the
different
individuals
here.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
objection
made
by
that?
justice
abe
fortas
now
this
statute
does
have
some
element
of
the
intent
as
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
was
any
point
raised
about
the
necessity
of
proof
of
the
intent
as
to
each
of
the
individuals?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
question
here
as
to
whether
intent
has
to
be
particularized
as
to
the
individual
defendants
that
may
explain
what
i
have
in
mind
and
for
mind
by
saying
but
suppose
there
was
this
group
150?
justice
abe
fortas
two
hundred?
and
let's
suppose
that
some
of
them
had
the
intention
of
breaking
into
the
jail
in
the
morning.
is
there
a
question
as
to
whether
that
intent
could
be
attributed
to
the
entire
group
without
proof
of
knowledge
or
whether
proof
of
knowledge
would
be
necessary,
whether
proof
of
the
--
that
the
intent
was
the
intent
of
each
one
of
the
defendants?
justice
abe
fortas
all
or
each?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
knowledge
that
there
was
–
that
some
of
the
individuals
had
that
intent
and
then
having
made
that
raised
any
question
as
to
whether
mere
knowledge
would
result
in
--
would
support
attribution
of
the
intent
necessary
to
statutory
violation
to
the
others?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
could
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
supposed
200
school
children,
let's
say
high
school
children,
and
this
happen
to
congregate
there,
part
for
many
question
of
purpose
reason
or
whatnot,
same
place,
in
our
opinion,
would
that
have
been
a
trespass?
justice
abe
fortas
and
no
--
no
particular
--
no
permission,
expressed
permission,
they
just
come
by.
would
that
have
been
a
trespass
under
your
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
they
would
have
been
subject
to
prosecution?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
was
a
public
place?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
public
was
invited
that
was
part
of
the
public
property?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
200
high
school
children
congregated
in
a
park,
that
would
not
be
a
trespass
when
it
is
a
public
park.
justice
abe
fortas
and
suppose
200
children
gathered
on
the
driveway
on
mister.
i
don't
mean
the
driveway,
i
mean
the
parking
area
near
the
jail,
would
that
have
been
a
trespass?
you
see
what
i'm
getting
at
is
what
this,
this
is
public
property
and
the
public
presumably
is
invited
for
some
purposes.
now,
what
is
it
here
that
converts
us
into
a
trespass
in
your
view
of
the
case
in
that
two
elements
of
trespass
under
that
statute
aren't
correct?
what
is
going
on
the
property
without
permission
and
they
have
the
same
sort
of
specific
intent?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
now
what
is
it
that
converts
the
public
utilization
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
public
property?
what
is
it
that
converts
such
utilization
into
a
trespass
in
your
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
so
they
couldn't
charge
you
with
trespass.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
that's
right
for
me;
i
must
invite
you
to
be
very
specific.
it
would
become
a
trespass
when
these
people
said
that
they
were
there
for
the
purpose
of
protest.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
assume
which
you
may
not,
but
if
you
do
assume
that
it
wasn't
for
mere
presence
of
these
people
at
this
particular
place
should
constitute
a
trespass.
but
if
there
was
something
else
that
converted
their
presence
into
a
trespass
on
your
statute,
i'm
inviting
you
to
tell
us
precisely
what
it
was
that
converted
this
presence
of
these
people
into
a
violation
of
law
under
your
trespass
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
they
move
back
two
feet?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
mean
or
worse
for
the
petitioners
in
your
view
of
the
case
here.
that
is
same
cox
was
--
what
will
i
say,
“carrying
on”
these
orders
in
approaching
this
order.
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
it,
i
take
it?
