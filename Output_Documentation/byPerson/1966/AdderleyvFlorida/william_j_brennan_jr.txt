justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
upon
the
properly
of
another
is
that
the
way
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
was
--
this
is
a
public
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
private
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
interpretation
you
give
me
in
the
statute
as
“property
of
another”
includes
public
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
general
public
was
excluded
from
this
area?
is
there
any
evidence
on
that
subject?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
evidently,
an
old
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
these
were
all
students
further?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
this
at
page
32,
mr.
feder
wherein
sheriff
testified
in
page
32?
at
this
time,
he
said
that
he
instructed
the
officers
to
surround
the
group
and
take
them
in
custody.
at
this
time,
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
started
about,
“we
came
here
to
be
arrested.
that's
what
we
wanted.”
and
blue
and
white
post
to
that,
got
up
from
the
ground
and
stood
up
and
said,
“white”.
no
resistance,
no
violence
of
any
kind
will
march
in,
when
they
pass
immediately,
we
march
them
into
the
basement
of
the
jail.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
is
that
what
you
were
referring
to
as
the
evidence
which
bears
on
whether
or
not
they
came
in
to
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
we
get
into
that,
mr.
feder,
are
you
making
any
argument
based
on
this
wording,
“property
of
another”
“on
property
of
another?”
are
you
making
an
argument
based
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
vagueness
or
any
other
kind
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what's
the
vagueness
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it's
public
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
served
as
like
cox?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
bouie
doesn't
later
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
bouie
doesn't
that
raised
a
question
of
vagueness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
filed
and
thought
in
anther
then
another?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
i
know,
this
is
not
the
point
you
are
addressing,
mr.
feder.
looking
at
your
brief
again,
i
don't
see
or
is
there
any
place
where
you
raised
bouie
vagueness
point
on
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
raise
it
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
bouie
followed
all
of
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
my
point,
you
see.
if
this
statute
breach
is
only
a
trespass
in
the
sense
that
it
has
been
unlawful
entry
in
the
first
instance,
then
whatever
conduct
they
might
have
been
guilty
of
that's
all
the
statute
mean.
they
could
have
been
guilty
of
violating
the
statute,
as
i
understand,
the
states
possession.
but
you
are
not
urging
that
for.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
not
in
the
context,
the
vagueness
of
the
--
they
had
no
notice
that
the
statute
would
embrace.
they
refused
all
to
leave
after
a
lawful
entry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wish
--
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
time
but
i
can't
find
it
in
the
brief.
you
don't
cite
bouie.
