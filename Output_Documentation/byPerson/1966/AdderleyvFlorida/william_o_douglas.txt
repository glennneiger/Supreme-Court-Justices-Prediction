oh,
i
thought
your
point
was
that
there
was
that
the
thing
that
triggered
the
trespass
was
a
lawful
order
of
the
sheriff
that
they
had
to
disperse.
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is,
that
might
depend
upon
the
location
of
this
group
was
with
reference
to
the
jail
property
if
they
were
on
the
remote
outskirts
that
might
be
said
to
be
without
the
beyond
the
implied
authority
of
the
sheriff
as
custodian
or
that
was
right
up
near
the
jail
and
one
might
say
that
was
certainly
within
the
proper
authority
of
the
custodian.
but
the
record
is
silent
as
to
where
all
these
happen.
now,
is
this
exhibit
that
you
say
was
marked
for
identification
but
not
introduced,
does
that
still
extend?
