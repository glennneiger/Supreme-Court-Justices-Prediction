mr.
william
d.
roth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
one
of
the
question
that
was
asked
petitioner,
the
records
thus
show
that
there
were
some
11
people
in
jail,
i
believe,
that
time.
the
jailer
testified
that
there
were
four
white
women
that
went
there
for
contempt
and
two
other
women
that
went
there
for
contempt
and
then
five
negro
girls
who
were
in
there
for
contempt.
no,
no,
excuse
me
four
of
the
--
four
of
the
white
women
were
in
there
for
being
drunk,
for
deed
of
the
act
charges.
so
--
so
these
were
separate
charges.
so,
the
record
shows
that
there
were
about
11
people
in
the
jail
of
this
town.
mr.
william
d.
roth
i've
been
by
there
many
times,
your
honor,
i
couldn't
tell
you
certainly
how
large
is
the
jail.
it's
simply
is.
well,
there's
a
juvenile
home
at
hand
and
part
of
that
is
used
by
the
jail
at
sometimes.
now,
this
particular
time,
if
the
county
fairgrounds,
most
of
the
persons
that
had
been
arrested
during
the
demonstrations
had
been
taken
out
to
the
county
fair
ground
to
a
new
facility
that
had
been
out
there
because
of
the
over
crowded
condition
of
the
jail.
so,
at
this
time,
the
jail
was
not
anywhere
near
full
capacity
this
time.
one
other
point
that
really
on
the
record
doesn't
show
and
not
having
taken
part
in
the
trial
below,
i
can't
tell.
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
the
other
70
people
out
of
the
32
who
were
prosecuted
and
the
170
or
74
that
weren't
prosecuted.
the
record
isn't
entirely
clear
on
that.
petitioner
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
one-way
driveway
that
comes
out
in
one
of
the
streets
which
is
perpendicular
to
the
jail
and
i
believe
it's
a
gravel
driveway.
it's
a
one-way
driveway.
i
would
say
it
is
probably
wide
enough
for
two
and
a
half
cars
or
may
be
more
than
that.
there's
a
little
--
in
southern
terms
a
(inaudible)
overhang
right
in
front
right
over
the
stairs.
and
sheriff
joyce
testified
that
this
was
used
primarily
for
maintenance
men
and
also
for
bringing
in
prisoners,
even
bringing
in
or
taking
prisoners
out
of
the
jail.
sheriff
joyce
also
testified
that
monday
i
believe
with
specially
specific
calls
often
times
they
had
juveniles
in
there
that
had
to
be
taken
to
the
juvenile
court
or
to
the
other
courts
in
town.
but
in
an
answer
to
another
question,
there
is
no
grassy
part
of
against
jail.
in
other
words,
there
is
the
driveway
and
then
the
grassy
part
and
then
the
sidewalk
that
i'm
talking
about.
unfortunately,
this
exhibit
was
not
put
into
the
record.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
i
couldn't
give
you
the
measurement.
there's
a
slope
there
and
then
in
another
level
i
would
say
10
or
15
feet
higher
there
is
another
parking
lot
there
which
i
believe
they
used
for
the
county
health
people.
and
the
grassy
–
it's
all
from
here
to
one
of
the
columns
i
suppose.
if
that
was,
i
would
say
the
grassy
area
isn't
that
one.
now,
this
is
where
possibly
we
have
a
little
disagreement
with
petitioner.
sheriff
joyce
testified
that
his
men
encircled
just
the
people
that
were
on
the
area
of
the
driveway
and
not
people
there
were
in
the
sidewalk
or
on
the
sidewalks
or
on
the
streets.
now,
it
is
true
that
two
of
the
petitioners
who
testified
claim
that
they
couldn't
leave
as
they
wanted
to
leave.
so
--
so
the
time
sequence
was
important.
now,
sheriff
joyce
arrived
on
the
scene
and
supposedly
he
was
there
about
10
minutes.
there
is
testimony,
i
believe
the
reason
when
--
because
we're
taking
that
he
was
spending
the
time
seeing
if
the
jail
was
secured.
then
sheriff
joyce
came
out
and
noticed
two
student
leaders
and
the
crowd
judge
let
this
in.
sheriff
joyce
did
recognize
these
student
leaders,
leaning
up
against
one
of
the
supports
of
the
overhang
that
is
over
the
entrance
to
the
jail
area,
to
side
of
the
jail
and
one
of
these
petitioners
white
or
blue,
i
believe
blue
is
one
of
these
petitioners
and
then
mr.
white
was
not.
mr.
william
d.
roth
white
and
blue,
yes,
sir.
the
sheriff
spoke
to
these
people
about
five
to
ten
minutes
and
imploring
them
to
please
leave
and
get
off
this
area
of
the
jail.
the
students
would
not
leave.
and
then,
there
was
this
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriff
also
that
the
--
some
other
people
said
that
we
came
to
be
arrested.
now,
unfortunately,
the
record
does
not
show
which
people
said
that.
and,
also
it's
our
contention
in
this
regard
that
certainly
one
person
passing
by
wouldn't
be
a
trespasser.
mr.
william
d.
roth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
mentioned
before
the
recess,
unfortunately,
the
diagram
that
was
introduced
and
that
was
used
by
the
various,
by
the
deputy
sheriff
and
the
sheriff
at
the
trial
was
not
introduced
in
the
evidence
and
it
was
not
part
of
this
record.
however,
on
page
27
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
excuse
me,
sir.
the
diagram
which
was
used
as
a
part
of
the
description
of
the
property
that
the
trespass
occurred
on
is
not
in
this
record.
on
page
27
of
this
record,
it
does
show
the
fact
that
there
was
a
driveway
and
then
there
was
a
parking
area
and
then
the
grassy
part
that
i
mentioned
and
then
an
upper
parking
area.
mr.
william
d.
roth
if
someone
want
to
park
there,
presume
that
they
could
on
the
upper
part,
before
going
to
the
health
department
to
save
up
something.
mr.
william
d.
roth
on
the
other
side
of
the
jail,
yes,
sir,
there
is
a
juvenile
home.
mr.
william
d.
roth
and
i
believe
--
and
there's
a
health
building
on
the
other
side
of
the
--
of
parking
lot
number
2
which
is
on
the
upper
area.
now,
she--
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
it's
not
like
a
quadrangle
in
that
sense
but
certainly
it's
public
–
i
walked
to
there
before
many
times
and
i'm
sure
many
other
citizens
have.
and
that
they're
been
stopped.
now,
what
we
can't
hint
here,
the
question
was,
that
this
became
a
trespass
when
these
petitioners
were
told
to
leave.
now,
sheriff
joyce
also
testified
that
there
were
three
other
adult
women
there.
and
he
asked
his
deputies
to
ask
this
people
if
they
were
part
of
the
demonstration
or
what.
i
think
there
were
three
older
negro
women
and
the
sheriff,
the
deputy
sheriff
asked
these
people
and
these
people
left.
there
were
other
people
left.
now,
sheriff
joyce's
testimony
is
replete,
that
no
one
was
arrested
except
the
group
that
was
in
the
driveway
and
possibly
and
the
people
that
were
all
in
that
group.
now,
there
is
conflicting
testimony
from
the
petitioners.
now,
there
were
three
petitioners
had
testified.
one
of
the
petitioners
testified
that
she
was
unable
to
leave;
that
there
wasn't
enough
time
involved
because
the
sheriff
only
gave
them
from
one
to
four
minutes
to
leave
after
talking
to
the
two
student
leaders
about
leaving.
the
petitioners
have
tried
to
base
this
case
squarely
on
point
with
the
cox
case
or
the
cox
cases
and
the
edwards
case.
we
contend
that
there
are
many
or
several
differences
in
these
cases
that
are
distinguishable.
first
of
all,
in
the
cox
cases
it
was
shown
that
there
was
a
definite
permission
given
to
the
demonstrators.
from
the
very
outset
of
the
demonstration
in
cox,
it
was
shown
that
the
state
officials
were
trying
to
hinder
them.
some
2,000
students
congregated
in
the
cox
case
and
were
attempting
to
march
up
to
a
courthouse
which
also
housed
a
jail
to
protest
the
arrest
of
some
of
their
member
and
also
to
protest
the
conditions
in
that
town
in
louisiana.
now,
it
was
shown
from
the
beginning
of
the
case
that
the
authorities
of
that
city
first
of
all
arrested
that
mr.
moore,
he
was
the
group
leader.
the
authorities
then
arrested
the
bus
drivers
that
were
to
drive
these
students
some
four
to
five
miles
to
where
the
protest
was
to
take
place.
mr.
cox
then
took
over
the
march
and
upon
arriving,
arriving
in
an
area
near
the
courthouse,
was
accosted
by
two
officers.
mr.
cox
told
these
two
officers
his
purpose.
he
said,
“the
purpose
of
the
demonstration
is
to
protest
the
conditions
here
in
this
city
of
louisiana.
we
would
like
to
have
a
short
meeting
across
the
street
from
the
courthouse
which
housed
the
jail.
we
would
like
to
sing
the
pledge
or
the
national
anthem,
say
the
pledge
of
allegiance
and
have
a
little
speech.”
the
police
officers
then
said,
“we
don't
know,
you
can't
do
that.”
then
one
of
the
police
officers
contacted
the
chief
of
police
and
the
chief
of
police
met
the
demonstrators
as
they
had
gone
another
few
blocks
near
the
courthouse.
and
that
time,
the
chief
of
police
said,
“alright,
you
can
have
15
minutes
or
you
can
have
20
minutes”.
and
after
speaking
for
15
to
20
minutes,
then
the
police
stepped
in
and
broke
up
the
demonstration
with
teargas
and
the
next
day
arrested
mr.
cox
for
four
violations,
three
of
which
he
was
convicted
of
the
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
in
louisiana,
obstructing
a
public
sidewalk
or
thoroughfare
and
then
picketing
near
the
courthouse.
now,
and
there
was
a
direct
and
tacit
permission
from
the
authorities
of
baton
rouge
or
of
the
city
in
louisiana.
now,
in
this
case,
the
demonstrators
started
at
florida
a&m
which
i
supposed
is
about
a
mile
from
this
area.
there
was
one
word
said
to
these
people
a
whole
time.
sheriff
joyce
was
in
a
conference.
upon
learning
that
the
persons
had
approached
the
jailhouse,
sheriff
joyce
came
and
spent
five
to
ten
minutes
looking
over
the
situation.
sheriff
joyce
was
satisfied
that
no
one
had
tried
to
break
in
the
jail.
and
i
believe,
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
a
question
in
that
regard.
it
is
not
the
states
contention
that
any
of
the
petitioners
tried
to
break
in
the
jail
or
tried
to
go
up
the
stairs.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
that
deputy
sheriff
deckle,
who
was
he
jailer,
met
the
petitioners
as
they
came
off
of
godson
street
into
the
one
way
gravel
parking
area
and
up
to
the
porch
or
overhang
of
the
jail.
and
when
they
came
within
two
feet
of
this
area,
sheriff
deckle
asked
them
to
stop
and
the
students
moved
back.
now,
petitioners
contend
that
this
was
the
permission
given
by
the
deputy
sheriff
saying,
“you
folks
please
move
back
so
we
can
run
this
jail.”
that
the
deputy
sheriff
and
then
the
sheriff
later
gave
this
people
permission
as
was
the
case
in
the
edwards
case
and
the
cox
cases.
mr.
william
d.
roth
and
they've
been
asked
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
there
are
in
the
cases
defining
that
but
i
would
say,
yes,
sir
it
would
be.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
sir.
i
think
they
would
be.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
sir.
it
was.
mr.
william
d.
roth
it
was
public
property
yes,
sir,
in
the
sense
that
the
inside
of
the
jail
is
not
for
sale
but
if
you
have
business
to
walk
inside
the
jail,
that's
public
property.
mr.
william
d.
roth
that's
right.
i
would
think
it
would
not
be.
mr.
william
d.
roth
where
with
the
malicious
and
mischievous
intent,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
your
honor
in
my
opinion,
the
very
nature
of
what
these
people
said
or
what
petitioner
said
when
they
came
to
this
area,
the
very
area
that
they
only
use
for
that
entrance
to
the
jail
or
for
the
entrance
way
there
is
to
bring
in
prisoners,
ingress
and
egress
of
prisoners
and
for
maintenance
--
maintenance
men
to
come.
i
would
say
that
if
i
drove
my
car
there
and
park
it.
i
never
did.
well
unless
if
i've
driven
my
car
there
and
park
it
they
could
possibly
remove
my
car.
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
so
they
couldn't
charge
me
with
trespass.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
when
all
these
people
had
gotten
this
area
and
announced
that
they
wanted
to
be
arrested,
at
least
some
of
the,
although
there
is
a
problem
in
the
record
of
which
one
of
these
petitioners
if
any
or
which
one
said
that.
that
this
converted
this
into
a
trespass
when
the
sheriff
told
them
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
it
would
have
been
if
they
have
said
that
but
that
is
not
in
the
record;
that
this
was
ever
said.
this,
if
i
may,
this
was
a
distinction
also
in
the
cox
cases
and
the
edwards
cases
which
petitioners
were
allowing.
there
were
no
placards.
in
fact,
the
only
testimony
of
the
three
petitioners
who
testified
was
really
subjectively
what
is
in
their
minds.
then
if
they
knew
and
they
said
--
and
the
sheriff
knew
this
because
all
these
people
were
jailed
there.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
speculate
on
what
we
don't
have
in
the
decisions
on
that
particular
statute
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
this
--
yes,
this
is
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
i
don't
know
--
i
didn't
mean
to
mislead
the
court.
i
don't
know
whether
if
for
sure
it
was
marked
for
identification.
it
was
a
blackboard
that
was
used
and
the
record
would
show
that
the
deputy
juror
–
mr.
william
d.
roth
a
blackboard
demonstration.
so,
i'm
afraid
that
it
wasn't
used
as
an
exhibit.
i
believe
that
mr.
simon,
representing
petitioners
or
defendants
below,
agreed
to
stipulate
but
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
introduced
in
the
record.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
sir.
and
the--
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
sir.
it's
never
been
construed
either
way.
in
fact,
this
statute
has
never
been
construed
in
this
regard.
this
statute
was
passed
in
1860
or
1870
something.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
it
would
say
to
me
that
it
could
be
either
way
that
the
initial
entry
could
be
lawful
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
sir.
i
don't
it
is
because
the
statute
also
puts
the
intent
in
their.
maybe
i
suppose
--
maybe
i'm
speaking
of
the
separate
aspect.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
i
don't
have
it
my
fingertips
in
the
other
florida
statute
exactly
on
this.
now
we
have
another
trespass
statute
going
in
state
land
and
taking
cox
but
i
don't
know
that
would
the
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
sir.
you're
right.
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
i'm
unsure.
mr.
william
d.
roth
the
--
its
a
miss
to
me.
i
think
it's
up
to
two
months
or
one
$100.00.
now,
i
think
in
this
case
it
was
either
$25.00
or
$50.00,
the
punishment
that
was
inflicted.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
i
think
he
was
fined
it
could
be
no
more
than
$100.00.
mr.
william
d.
roth
sir?
mr.
william
d.
roth
i
don't
think
there
was
a
jail,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
with
this
exception,
your
honor,
that
they
want
the
public
health
building
was
on
the
four
side
of
the
jailhouse.
mr.
william
d.
roth
the
--
the
lower
parking
area
which
was
adjacent
to
the
gravel
area
which
petitioners
were
arrested
on
was
actually
--
was
considered
the
parking
lot
of
the
jail.
i
would
say
sheriff
joyce
testified
that
he
came
in
and
parked
in
the
first
two
areas
in
the
wide
strip.
one
way
strip
it
goes
by
the
one
of
the
side
of
the
jail.
then
there
was
a
grassy
strip.
then
there
was
the
upper
parking
area
and
the
other
building
that
i
mentioned
was
on
the
other
side
of
that.
so,
it
wasn't
contiguous
in
the
sense
that
all
the
buildings
were
just
lined
up
in
the
sense
semi-circle
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
as
the
record
is
silent
as
to
any
other
division
as
to
the
upper
parking
lot.
now
sheriff
joyce
did
testify
that
this
area
of
the
lower
parking
area
and
the
entrance
way
and
there
was
under
his
custody.
but
as
far
as
stipulation
on
the
record
of
lot
numbers
or
which
was
which
know
this,
the
record
is
silent
on
this.
and
the
--
another
distinction
that
was
made
of
the
petitioner
attempts
to
make
in
the
cox
cases
or
rather
to
show
that
they
are
similar,
is
the
fact
that
there
was
a
jail
involved
here.
there
was
a
jail
involved
in
the
cox
case
with
a
jail
inside
of
the
courthouse.
but
again,
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
specific
permission
was
given
in
both
the
cox
cases
and
the
edwards
case
which
petitioner
said
is
in
direct
conflict.
and
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
permission
given.
the
deputy
sheriff
walked
out
of
the
--
down
the
entrance
way
and
saw
these
people
to
see
me.
he
said,
“please
move
back
two
feet.”
he
immediately
called
the
sheriff.
the
sheriff
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
it's
on
the
record.
and,
petitioner
says
that
this
was
analogous
to
the
situation
in
cox
in
which
the
mayor
said,
“you
have
15
minutes”
but
let's
break
it
about
to
that.
although
in
cox,
the
reason
that
the
authority
grabbed
it
up
is
because
they
considered
certain
aspect
of
mr.
cox's
colloquy
there
or
his
speech
there
as
in
citing
a
riot
or
something
like
that
when
he
said,
“rolled
out
sit
in
these
various
areas.”
but
in
the
present
case,
there
is
no
showing
that
anything
will
see
it.
he
just
said
that
sheriff
joyce
surely
knew
why
these
people
were
here.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
from
--
from
the
stand,
i
think
it
makes
it
worse
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case
because
in
the
cox
case,
it
was
stated
time
and
time
again,
and
with
majority
opinion
that
these
people,
that
the
authorities
knew
what
it
was
and
given
them
permission
to
do
it
for
a
certain
length
of
time
that
the
statute
was
vague
because
they
have
the
permission
to
step
in
anytime
they
would
revoke
it.
in
this
permission,
it
just
showed
that
sheriff
joyce,
upon
coming
on
the
jail,
suddenly
confronted,
its
custodian
of
the
jail
was
suddenly
confronted
with
having
about
200
to
300
individuals
right
here
in
the
driveway
area
on
the
side
of
the
jail
and
this
other
area
that
he
asked
these
people
to
leave,
that
the
people
hadn't
say
a
word
with
placard
or
what
were
doing
or
anything
and
the
people
--
some
of
the
people
said,
“we
came
to
be
arrested.”
upon
telling
the
group
itself
to
leave,
some
more
of
the
group
sat
down
and
didn't
leave.
now,
the
only
question
in
this
regard
about
the
true
identity
of
these
people
and
it
was
raised
by
petitioner
is,
that
since
each
one
of
these
petitioners
weren't
specifically
and
individually
pointed
out
that
they
should
void
the
whole
way.
i
have
three
of
those
aspects
in
my
brief.
sheriff
joyce
did
give
sworn
assurances
that
the
only
arrested
were
the
people
right
in
the
group
there;
that
no
one
was
arrested
in
the
upper
parking
lot.
again,
this
goes
to
your
question
of
various
jurisdictions,
your
honor,
of
the
various
dealings
which
is
unfortunately
not
on
the
record,
that
no
one
was
arrested
on
the
public
sidewalk
of
the
jail,
that
no
one
was
arrested
on
the
street.
and
it
was
our
contention
that
this
was
–
that
the
sheriff
did
this
as
custodian
and
that
he
had
the
legal
right
to
do
this
and
if
no
matter
which
group
they
did
it,
now
or
later.
one
other
point
that
petitioners
had
raised
is
the
fact
of
abatement,
which
is
also
true
to
both
of
our
briefs.
petitioners
says
that
under
the
period
of
abatement,
the
passages
in
1964
civil
rights
act,
under
the
case
of
heart
of
atlanta
motel
and
katzenbach
versus
mcclung
that
this
should
be
applicable
in
this
case
which
say
that
it
isn't
because
this
jail
was
not
a
place
for
public
accommodation.
now,
petitioners
responded
that
by
saying,
“well,
that
was
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing”.
now,
we
contend
that
this
is
just
not
so
that
if
the
custodian
of
that
area,
of
the
jail,
is
powerless
to
regulate
that
particular
area
no
matter
who
comes
there
and
blocking
this
area
that
it
would
make
the
running
of
the
jail
or
any
other
facility
for
that
matter
very
hard.
now,
the
state
of
florida
has
recognized,
as
a
footnote
and
being
honest
to
the
court,
the
state
of
florida
has
recognized
the
difficulty
of
proving
who
was
there
in
an
area
like
this.
and
in
that
fort
lauderdale
the
prosecutor
was
in
touch
of
the
office
not
long
ago.
and
in
pop
in
the
beach
when
there
was
some
trouble
down
there
and
all
of
the
petitioners
were
--
where
some
petitioners
were
let
go
because
they
couldn't
--
they
didn't
have
specific
identification.
now,
there's
no
report
of
cases
where
it's
done.
and
the
procedure
now
is,
is
the
use
of
moving
pictures
a
possible
and
other
type
of
pictures
as
was
done
by
the
newspaper
people
or
the
television
people
in
the
cox
case.
well,
unfortunately,
we
don't
have
this
in
the
present
case.
petitioner
also
says
that
there
is
a
lack
of
relevant
evidence
in
this
case.
we
contend
there's
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
as
to
what
sheriff
joyce
said
and
as
to
what
the
three
petitioners
had
testified
said
but
certainly,
there
is
no
lack
of
relevant
evidence
in
this
case.
it
was
shown
that
the
petitioners
went
to
the
spot.
it
was
shown
that
the
petitioners
were
asked
to
leave.
it
was
shown
that
some
of
the
petitioners
or
some
of
the
people
or
the
250
that
were
there
did
leave.
it
was
later
shown
that
the
petitioners
made
no
showing
of
why
they
were
there
or
what
they
were
protesting
or
anything
of
this
nature.
and
that
the
petitioners
even
or
some
of
them
anyway,
even
evidence
had
attempted
to
be
arrested.
now,
the
state
would
cheerfully
admit
that
just
because
someone
wants
to
be
arrested,
doesn't
give
the
place
the
right
to
arrest
there.
now
just
because
i
walked
at
the
place
on
the
streets
and
“hey,
arrest
me
here,
i'm
protesting”.
or
something
this,
if
i
haven't
broken
any
law,
this
is
no
reason.
but
i
only
mentioned
this
to
show
as
a
part
of
the
intent
in
the
statute
when
it
says
with
a
mischievous
and
malicious
intent
and
would
contend
that
that
is
what
this
goes
to.
the
other
point,
which
is
the
lack
of
relevant
evidence,
i
think
that
it
was
treated
the
point
before.
and
also,
the
petitioners
have
said
that
this
was
the
use
of
“a
petty
criminal
statute”
to
prohibit
or
to
hinder
people
in
exercising
their
rights.
one
of
these
statutes
was
not
passed
during
any
--
this
statue
has
been
on
the
books
for
a
long
time.
in
fact,
florida
has
not
passed,
to
my
knowledge
except
for
the
schools
which
of
course
were
unconstitutional
has
not
passed
any
laws
about
or
any
additional
laws
in
the
last
10
years,
making
it
unlawful
to
stand
in
a
public
building
after
being
ordered
to
leave
or
making
unlawful
to
go
in
sidewalks
or
anything
else.
so
certainly,
by
the
very
fact
that
this
statute
is
an
old
statute,
and
i'm
not
contending
this
because
it's
old
it's
good
but
it
hasn't
been
tested
in
that
regard.
and
certainly,
this
was
not
attempt
on
the
part
of
florida
to
use
a
petty
criminal
statute,
just
to
prosecute
this
people.
now,
if
of
course
the
statute
is
no
good,
maybe
we
should
have
passed
some
of
the
statute.
but
we
contend
this
was
under
the
circumstance,
the
only
statute
that
could
have
been
used
under
our
statutory
law
and
may
be
this
is
a
failure
of
the
legislature
not
to
pass
that
statute
in
this
regard.
but
the
state
of
florida
has
been
fairly
fortunate
in
this
area
and
is
not
deemed
it
necessary
to
pass
to
allow
the
statutes
which
by
the
way,
have
most
been
thrown
anyway
by
this
court.
so,
it
would
really
have
been
unused
just
to
pass
it
and
we're
proud
we
didn't
have
it.
mr.
william
d.
roth
to
prove
that
isn't
the
conduct,
yes,
sir.
well,
by
the
--
i
think
that
both
words
can
be
or
this
can
be
shown
that
--
the
part
of
malicious
and
mischievous
can
be
shown
in
the
fact
that
petitioner,
upon
arriving
in
this
spot,
showed
that
they
wanted
to
be
arrested.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
i
said
--
i
said
that
in
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
well
that
is
in
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
i
said
that
that's
specifically,
i
didn't
think
would
allow
someone
be
arrested
just
because
i
showed
that
this
is
part
and
partial.
first
of
all
that.
second
of
all,
the
collectively
it
was
--
that
was
had
between
the
sheriff
and
the
two
student
leaders,
asking
them
to
leave
and
the
student
leaders
just
responding
by
sitting
down
on
the
ground,
most
of
them.
and
thirdly,
by
the
sheriff
then
asking
everyone
to
please
leave
that
this
was
a
trespass
and
if
you
don't
leave,
you're
going
to
be
arrested
for
it.
now,
we
certainly
contend
that
the
state
of
florida
has
a
power
to
do
this.
this
--
this
court
may
say
the
statute
is
not
good
and
you
will
have
to
pass
one
but
certainly,
we
have
this
power.
the
problem
just
may
be
that
this
is
not
the
statute
to
do
it
but
certainly,
we
contend
that
florida
has
this
power
to
do
this
or
a
county
has
a
power
to
do
this
in
the
orderly
paneling
of
the
day
to
day
facilities
of
the
jail.
so
we
contend,
your
honor,
that
this
combination
of
those
three
things.
what
the
sheriff
said
to
the
petitioners
talking
to
them,
the
evidence
contend
from
some
other
of
the
petitioners
or
from
the
group
there
saying
that,
“we
came
to
be
arrested”,
and
“why
didn't
they
arrest
us
last
night”
or
something
to
that
effect
and
then
the
fact
that
petitioners
made
no
effort
to
leave
but
in
fact,
when
asked
to
leave,
sat
down.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is.
i
don't
think
that
mr.
white
said
or
mr.
blue
said
that.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
the
record
showed,
i
think
that
one
of
the
men,
mr.
blue
was
sitting
down
at
the
time
that
he
was
talking
to.
but
as
far
as
specifically,
these
32
petitioners,
no
there
is
none.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
the
record
is
silent
as
to
that
and
i
didn't
take
any
part
in
the
prosecution
and
i
don't
know
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
sir.
the
only
thing
in
that
regard
is
one
of
the
deputy
sheriffs
said
that
through
pictures
and
fingerprints,
these
32
were
identified.
this
i
--
it
is
unclear
to
me
exactly
what
is
that
mean
but
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
william
d.
roth
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
d.
roth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
one
of
the
question
that
was
asked
petitioner,
the
records
thus
show
that
there
were
some
11
people
in
jail,
i
believe,
that
time.
the
jailer
testified
that
there
were
four
white
women
that
went
there
for
contempt
and
two
other
women
that
went
there
for
contempt
and
then
five
negro
girls
who
were
in
there
for
contempt.
no,
no,
excuse
me
four
of
the
--
four
of
the
white
women
were
in
there
for
being
drunk,
for
deed
of
the
act
charges.
so
--
so
these
were
separate
charges.
so,
the
record
shows
that
there
were
about
11
people
in
the
jail
of
this
town.
mr.
william
d.
roth
i've
been
by
there
many
times,
your
honor,
i
couldn't
tell
you
certainly
how
large
is
the
jail.
it's
simply
is.
well,
there's
a
juvenile
home
at
hand
and
part
of
that
is
used
by
the
jail
at
sometimes.
now,
this
particular
time,
if
the
county
fairgrounds,
most
of
the
persons
that
had
been
arrested
during
the
demonstrations
had
been
taken
out
to
the
county
fair
ground
to
a
new
facility
that
had
been
out
there
because
of
the
over
crowded
condition
of
the
jail.
so,
at
this
time,
the
jail
was
not
anywhere
near
full
capacity
this
time.
one
other
point
that
really
on
the
record
doesn't
show
and
not
having
taken
part
in
the
trial
below,
i
can't
tell.
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
the
other
70
people
out
of
the
32
who
were
prosecuted
and
the
170
or
74
that
weren't
prosecuted.
the
record
isn't
entirely
clear
on
that.
petitioner
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
one-way
driveway
that
comes
out
in
one
of
the
streets
which
is
perpendicular
to
the
jail
and
i
believe
it's
a
gravel
driveway.
it's
a
one-way
driveway.
i
would
say
it
is
probably
wide
enough
for
two
and
a
half
cars
or
may
be
more
than
that.
there's
a
little
--
in
southern
terms
a
(inaudible)
overhang
right
in
front
right
over
the
stairs.
and
sheriff
joyce
testified
that
this
was
used
primarily
for
maintenance
men
and
also
for
bringing
in
prisoners,
even
bringing
in
or
taking
prisoners
out
of
the
jail.
sheriff
joyce
also
testified
that
monday
i
believe
with
specially
specific
calls
often
times
they
had
juveniles
in
there
that
had
to
be
taken
to
the
juvenile
court
or
to
the
other
courts
in
town.
but
in
an
answer
to
another
question,
there
is
no
grassy
part
of
against
jail.
in
other
words,
there
is
the
driveway
and
then
the
grassy
part
and
then
the
sidewalk
that
i'm
talking
about.
unfortunately,
this
exhibit
was
not
put
into
the
record.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
i
couldn't
give
you
the
measurement.
there's
a
slope
there
and
then
in
another
level
i
would
say
10
or
15
feet
higher
there
is
another
parking
lot
there
which
i
believe
they
used
for
the
county
health
people.
and
the
grassy
–
it's
all
from
here
to
one
of
the
columns
i
suppose.
if
that
was,
i
would
say
the
grassy
area
isn't
that
one.
now,
this
is
where
possibly
we
have
a
little
disagreement
with
petitioner.
sheriff
joyce
testified
that
his
men
encircled
just
the
people
that
were
on
the
area
of
the
driveway
and
not
people
there
were
in
the
sidewalk
or
on
the
sidewalks
or
on
the
streets.
now,
it
is
true
that
two
of
the
petitioners
who
testified
claim
that
they
couldn't
leave
as
they
wanted
to
leave.
so
--
so
the
time
sequence
was
important.
now,
sheriff
joyce
arrived
on
the
scene
and
supposedly
he
was
there
about
10
minutes.
there
is
testimony,
i
believe
the
reason
when
--
because
we're
taking
that
he
was
spending
the
time
seeing
if
the
jail
was
secured.
then
sheriff
joyce
came
out
and
noticed
two
student
leaders
and
the
crowd
judge
let
this
in.
sheriff
joyce
did
recognize
these
student
leaders,
leaning
up
against
one
of
the
supports
of
the
overhang
that
is
over
the
entrance
to
the
jail
area,
to
side
of
the
jail
and
one
of
these
petitioners
white
or
blue,
i
believe
blue
is
one
of
these
petitioners
and
then
mr.
white
was
not.
mr.
william
d.
roth
white
and
blue,
yes,
sir.
the
sheriff
spoke
to
these
people
about
five
to
ten
minutes
and
imploring
them
to
please
leave
and
get
off
this
area
of
the
jail.
the
students
would
not
leave.
and
then,
there
was
this
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriff
also
that
the
--
some
other
people
said
that
we
came
to
be
arrested.
now,
unfortunately,
the
record
does
not
show
which
people
said
that.
and,
also
it's
our
contention
in
this
regard
that
certainly
one
person
passing
by
wouldn't
be
a
trespasser.
mr.
william
d.
roth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
mentioned
before
the
recess,
unfortunately,
the
diagram
that
was
introduced
and
that
was
used
by
the
various,
by
the
deputy
sheriff
and
the
sheriff
at
the
trial
was
not
introduced
in
the
evidence
and
it
was
not
part
of
this
record.
however,
on
page
27
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
excuse
me,
sir.
the
diagram
which
was
used
as
a
part
of
the
description
of
the
property
that
the
trespass
occurred
on
is
not
in
this
record.
on
page
27
of
this
record,
it
does
show
the
fact
that
there
was
a
driveway
and
then
there
was
a
parking
area
and
then
the
grassy
part
that
i
mentioned
and
then
an
upper
parking
area.
mr.
william
d.
roth
if
someone
want
to
park
there,
presume
that
they
could
on
the
upper
part,
before
going
to
the
health
department
to
save
up
something.
mr.
william
d.
roth
on
the
other
side
of
the
jail,
yes,
sir,
there
is
a
juvenile
home.
mr.
william
d.
roth
and
i
believe
--
and
there's
a
health
building
on
the
other
side
of
the
--
of
parking
lot
number
2
which
is
on
the
upper
area.
now,
she--
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
it's
not
like
a
quadrangle
in
that
sense
but
certainly
it's
public
–
i
walked
to
there
before
many
times
and
i'm
sure
many
other
citizens
have.
and
that
they're
been
stopped.
now,
what
we
can't
hint
here,
the
question
was,
that
this
became
a
trespass
when
these
petitioners
were
told
to
leave.
now,
sheriff
joyce
also
testified
that
there
were
three
other
adult
women
there.
and
he
asked
his
deputies
to
ask
this
people
if
they
were
part
of
the
demonstration
or
what.
i
think
there
were
three
older
negro
women
and
the
sheriff,
the
deputy
sheriff
asked
these
people
and
these
people
left.
there
were
other
people
left.
now,
sheriff
joyce's
testimony
is
replete,
that
no
one
was
arrested
except
the
group
that
was
in
the
driveway
and
possibly
and
the
people
that
were
all
in
that
group.
now,
there
is
conflicting
testimony
from
the
petitioners.
now,
there
were
three
petitioners
had
testified.
one
of
the
petitioners
testified
that
she
was
unable
to
leave;
that
there
wasn't
enough
time
involved
because
the
sheriff
only
gave
them
from
one
to
four
minutes
to
leave
after
talking
to
the
two
student
leaders
about
leaving.
the
petitioners
have
tried
to
base
this
case
squarely
on
point
with
the
cox
case
or
the
cox
cases
and
the
edwards
case.
we
contend
that
there
are
many
or
several
differences
in
these
cases
that
are
distinguishable.
first
of
all,
in
the
cox
cases
it
was
shown
that
there
was
a
definite
permission
given
to
the
demonstrators.
from
the
very
outset
of
the
demonstration
in
cox,
it
was
shown
that
the
state
officials
were
trying
to
hinder
them.
some
2,000
students
congregated
in
the
cox
case
and
were
attempting
to
march
up
to
a
courthouse
which
also
housed
a
jail
to
protest
the
arrest
of
some
of
their
member
and
also
to
protest
the
conditions
in
that
town
in
louisiana.
now,
it
was
shown
from
the
beginning
of
the
case
that
the
authorities
of
that
city
first
of
all
arrested
that
mr.
moore,
he
was
the
group
leader.
the
authorities
then
arrested
the
bus
drivers
that
were
to
drive
these
students
some
four
to
five
miles
to
where
the
protest
was
to
take
place.
mr.
cox
then
took
over
the
march
and
upon
arriving,
arriving
in
an
area
near
the
courthouse,
was
accosted
by
two
officers.
mr.
cox
told
these
two
officers
his
purpose.
he
said,
“the
purpose
of
the
demonstration
is
to
protest
the
conditions
here
in
this
city
of
louisiana.
we
would
like
to
have
a
short
meeting
across
the
street
from
the
courthouse
which
housed
the
jail.
we
would
like
to
sing
the
pledge
or
the
national
anthem,
say
the
pledge
of
allegiance
and
have
a
little
speech.”
the
police
officers
then
said,
“we
don't
know,
you
can't
do
that.”
then
one
of
the
police
officers
contacted
the
chief
of
police
and
the
chief
of
police
met
the
demonstrators
as
they
had
gone
another
few
blocks
near
the
courthouse.
and
that
time,
the
chief
of
police
said,
“alright,
you
can
have
15
minutes
or
you
can
have
20
minutes”.
and
after
speaking
for
15
to
20
minutes,
then
the
police
stepped
in
and
broke
up
the
demonstration
with
teargas
and
the
next
day
arrested
mr.
cox
for
four
violations,
three
of
which
he
was
convicted
of
the
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
in
louisiana,
obstructing
a
public
sidewalk
or
thoroughfare
and
then
picketing
near
the
courthouse.
now,
and
there
was
a
direct
and
tacit
permission
from
the
authorities
of
baton
rouge
or
of
the
city
in
louisiana.
now,
in
this
case,
the
demonstrators
started
at
florida
a&m
which
i
supposed
is
about
a
mile
from
this
area.
there
was
one
word
said
to
these
people
a
whole
time.
sheriff
joyce
was
in
a
conference.
upon
learning
that
the
persons
had
approached
the
jailhouse,
sheriff
joyce
came
and
spent
five
to
ten
minutes
looking
over
the
situation.
sheriff
joyce
was
satisfied
that
no
one
had
tried
to
break
in
the
jail.
and
i
believe,
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
a
question
in
that
regard.
it
is
not
the
states
contention
that
any
of
the
petitioners
tried
to
break
in
the
jail
or
tried
to
go
up
the
stairs.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
that
deputy
sheriff
deckle,
who
was
he
jailer,
met
the
petitioners
as
they
came
off
of
godson
street
into
the
one
way
gravel
parking
area
and
up
to
the
porch
or
overhang
of
the
jail.
and
when
they
came
within
two
feet
of
this
area,
sheriff
deckle
asked
them
to
stop
and
the
students
moved
back.
now,
petitioners
contend
that
this
was
the
permission
given
by
the
deputy
sheriff
saying,
“you
folks
please
move
back
so
we
can
run
this
jail.”
that
the
deputy
sheriff
and
then
the
sheriff
later
gave
this
people
permission
as
was
the
case
in
the
edwards
case
and
the
cox
cases.
mr.
william
d.
roth
and
they've
been
asked
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
there
are
in
the
cases
defining
that
but
i
would
say,
yes,
sir
it
would
be.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
sir.
i
think
they
would
be.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
sir.
it
was.
mr.
william
d.
roth
it
was
public
property
yes,
sir,
in
the
sense
that
the
inside
of
the
jail
is
not
for
sale
but
if
you
have
business
to
walk
inside
the
jail,
that's
public
property.
mr.
william
d.
roth
that's
right.
i
would
think
it
would
not
be.
mr.
william
d.
roth
where
with
the
malicious
and
mischievous
intent,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
your
honor
in
my
opinion,
the
very
nature
of
what
these
people
said
or
what
petitioner
said
when
they
came
to
this
area,
the
very
area
that
they
only
use
for
that
entrance
to
the
jail
or
for
the
entrance
way
there
is
to
bring
in
prisoners,
ingress
and
egress
of
prisoners
and
for
maintenance
--
maintenance
men
to
come.
i
would
say
that
if
i
drove
my
car
there
and
park
it.
i
never
did.
well
unless
if
i've
driven
my
car
there
and
park
it
they
could
possibly
remove
my
car.
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
so
they
couldn't
charge
me
with
trespass.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
when
all
these
people
had
gotten
this
area
and
announced
that
they
wanted
to
be
arrested,
at
least
some
of
the,
although
there
is
a
problem
in
the
record
of
which
one
of
these
petitioners
if
any
or
which
one
said
that.
that
this
converted
this
into
a
trespass
when
the
sheriff
told
them
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
it
would
have
been
if
they
have
said
that
but
that
is
not
in
the
record;
that
this
was
ever
said.
this,
if
i
may,
this
was
a
distinction
also
in
the
cox
cases
and
the
edwards
cases
which
petitioners
were
allowing.
there
were
no
placards.
in
fact,
the
only
testimony
of
the
three
petitioners
who
testified
was
really
subjectively
what
is
in
their
minds.
then
if
they
knew
and
they
said
--
and
the
sheriff
knew
this
because
all
these
people
were
jailed
there.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
speculate
on
what
we
don't
have
in
the
decisions
on
that
particular
statute
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
this
--
yes,
this
is
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
i
don't
know
--
i
didn't
mean
to
mislead
the
court.
i
don't
know
whether
if
for
sure
it
was
marked
for
identification.
it
was
a
blackboard
that
was
used
and
the
record
would
show
that
the
deputy
juror
–
mr.
william
d.
roth
a
blackboard
demonstration.
so,
i'm
afraid
that
it
wasn't
used
as
an
exhibit.
i
believe
that
mr.
simon,
representing
petitioners
or
defendants
below,
agreed
to
stipulate
but
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
introduced
in
the
record.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
sir.
and
the--
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
sir.
it's
never
been
construed
either
way.
in
fact,
this
statute
has
never
been
construed
in
this
regard.
this
statute
was
passed
in
1860
or
1870
something.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
it
would
say
to
me
that
it
could
be
either
way
that
the
initial
entry
could
be
lawful
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
sir.
i
don't
it
is
because
the
statute
also
puts
the
intent
in
their.
maybe
i
suppose
--
maybe
i'm
speaking
of
the
separate
aspect.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
i
don't
have
it
my
fingertips
in
the
other
florida
statute
exactly
on
this.
now
we
have
another
trespass
statute
going
in
state
land
and
taking
cox
but
i
don't
know
that
would
the
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
sir.
you're
right.
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
i'm
unsure.
mr.
william
d.
roth
the
--
its
a
miss
to
me.
i
think
it's
up
to
two
months
or
one
$100.00.
now,
i
think
in
this
case
it
was
either
$25.00
or
$50.00,
the
punishment
that
was
inflicted.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
i
think
he
was
fined
it
could
be
no
more
than
$100.00.
mr.
william
d.
roth
sir?
mr.
william
d.
roth
i
don't
think
there
was
a
jail,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
with
this
exception,
your
honor,
that
they
want
the
public
health
building
was
on
the
four
side
of
the
jailhouse.
mr.
william
d.
roth
the
--
the
lower
parking
area
which
was
adjacent
to
the
gravel
area
which
petitioners
were
arrested
on
was
actually
--
was
considered
the
parking
lot
of
the
jail.
i
would
say
sheriff
joyce
testified
that
he
came
in
and
parked
in
the
first
two
areas
in
the
wide
strip.
one
way
strip
it
goes
by
the
one
of
the
side
of
the
jail.
then
there
was
a
grassy
strip.
then
there
was
the
upper
parking
area
and
the
other
building
that
i
mentioned
was
on
the
other
side
of
that.
so,
it
wasn't
contiguous
in
the
sense
that
all
the
buildings
were
just
lined
up
in
the
sense
semi-circle
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
as
the
record
is
silent
as
to
any
other
division
as
to
the
upper
parking
lot.
now
sheriff
joyce
did
testify
that
this
area
of
the
lower
parking
area
and
the
entrance
way
and
there
was
under
his
custody.
but
as
far
as
stipulation
on
the
record
of
lot
numbers
or
which
was
which
know
this,
the
record
is
silent
on
this.
and
the
--
another
distinction
that
was
made
of
the
petitioner
attempts
to
make
in
the
cox
cases
or
rather
to
show
that
they
are
similar,
is
the
fact
that
there
was
a
jail
involved
here.
there
was
a
jail
involved
in
the
cox
case
with
a
jail
inside
of
the
courthouse.
but
again,
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
specific
permission
was
given
in
both
the
cox
cases
and
the
edwards
case
which
petitioner
said
is
in
direct
conflict.
and
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
permission
given.
the
deputy
sheriff
walked
out
of
the
--
down
the
entrance
way
and
saw
these
people
to
see
me.
he
said,
“please
move
back
two
feet.”
he
immediately
called
the
sheriff.
the
sheriff
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes,
it's
on
the
record.
and,
petitioner
says
that
this
was
analogous
to
the
situation
in
cox
in
which
the
mayor
said,
“you
have
15
minutes”
but
let's
break
it
about
to
that.
although
in
cox,
the
reason
that
the
authority
grabbed
it
up
is
because
they
considered
certain
aspect
of
mr.
cox's
colloquy
there
or
his
speech
there
as
in
citing
a
riot
or
something
like
that
when
he
said,
“rolled
out
sit
in
these
various
areas.”
but
in
the
present
case,
there
is
no
showing
that
anything
will
see
it.
he
just
said
that
sheriff
joyce
surely
knew
why
these
people
were
here.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
from
--
from
the
stand,
i
think
it
makes
it
worse
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case
because
in
the
cox
case,
it
was
stated
time
and
time
again,
and
with
majority
opinion
that
these
people,
that
the
authorities
knew
what
it
was
and
given
them
permission
to
do
it
for
a
certain
length
of
time
that
the
statute
was
vague
because
they
have
the
permission
to
step
in
anytime
they
would
revoke
it.
in
this
permission,
it
just
showed
that
sheriff
joyce,
upon
coming
on
the
jail,
suddenly
confronted,
its
custodian
of
the
jail
was
suddenly
confronted
with
having
about
200
to
300
individuals
right
here
in
the
driveway
area
on
the
side
of
the
jail
and
this
other
area
that
he
asked
these
people
to
leave,
that
the
people
hadn't
say
a
word
with
placard
or
what
were
doing
or
anything
and
the
people
--
some
of
the
people
said,
“we
came
to
be
arrested.”
upon
telling
the
group
itself
to
leave,
some
more
of
the
group
sat
down
and
didn't
leave.
now,
the
only
question
in
this
regard
about
the
true
identity
of
these
people
and
it
was
raised
by
petitioner
is,
that
since
each
one
of
these
petitioners
weren't
specifically
and
individually
pointed
out
that
they
should
void
the
whole
way.
i
have
three
of
those
aspects
in
my
brief.
sheriff
joyce
did
give
sworn
assurances
that
the
only
arrested
were
the
people
right
in
the
group
there;
that
no
one
was
arrested
in
the
upper
parking
lot.
again,
this
goes
to
your
question
of
various
jurisdictions,
your
honor,
of
the
various
dealings
which
is
unfortunately
not
on
the
record,
that
no
one
was
arrested
on
the
public
sidewalk
of
the
jail,
that
no
one
was
arrested
on
the
street.
and
it
was
our
contention
that
this
was
–
that
the
sheriff
did
this
as
custodian
and
that
he
had
the
legal
right
to
do
this
and
if
no
matter
which
group
they
did
it,
now
or
later.
one
other
point
that
petitioners
had
raised
is
the
fact
of
abatement,
which
is
also
true
to
both
of
our
briefs.
petitioners
says
that
under
the
period
of
abatement,
the
passages
in
1964
civil
rights
act,
under
the
case
of
heart
of
atlanta
motel
and
katzenbach
versus
mcclung
that
this
should
be
applicable
in
this
case
which
say
that
it
isn't
because
this
jail
was
not
a
place
for
public
accommodation.
now,
petitioners
responded
that
by
saying,
“well,
that
was
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing”.
now,
we
contend
that
this
is
just
not
so
that
if
the
custodian
of
that
area,
of
the
jail,
is
powerless
to
regulate
that
particular
area
no
matter
who
comes
there
and
blocking
this
area
that
it
would
make
the
running
of
the
jail
or
any
other
facility
for
that
matter
very
hard.
now,
the
state
of
florida
has
recognized,
as
a
footnote
and
being
honest
to
the
court,
the
state
of
florida
has
recognized
the
difficulty
of
proving
who
was
there
in
an
area
like
this.
and
in
that
fort
lauderdale
the
prosecutor
was
in
touch
of
the
office
not
long
ago.
and
in
pop
in
the
beach
when
there
was
some
trouble
down
there
and
all
of
the
petitioners
were
--
where
some
petitioners
were
let
go
because
they
couldn't
--
they
didn't
have
specific
identification.
now,
there's
no
report
of
cases
where
it's
done.
and
the
procedure
now
is,
is
the
use
of
moving
pictures
a
possible
and
other
type
of
pictures
as
was
done
by
the
newspaper
people
or
the
television
people
in
the
cox
case.
well,
unfortunately,
we
don't
have
this
in
the
present
case.
petitioner
also
says
that
there
is
a
lack
of
relevant
evidence
in
this
case.
we
contend
there's
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
as
to
what
sheriff
joyce
said
and
as
to
what
the
three
petitioners
had
testified
said
but
certainly,
there
is
no
lack
of
relevant
evidence
in
this
case.
it
was
shown
that
the
petitioners
went
to
the
spot.
it
was
shown
that
the
petitioners
were
asked
to
leave.
it
was
shown
that
some
of
the
petitioners
or
some
of
the
people
or
the
250
that
were
there
did
leave.
it
was
later
shown
that
the
petitioners
made
no
showing
of
why
they
were
there
or
what
they
were
protesting
or
anything
of
this
nature.
and
that
the
petitioners
even
or
some
of
them
anyway,
even
evidence
had
attempted
to
be
arrested.
now,
the
state
would
cheerfully
admit
that
just
because
someone
wants
to
be
arrested,
doesn't
give
the
place
the
right
to
arrest
there.
now
just
because
i
walked
at
the
place
on
the
streets
and
“hey,
arrest
me
here,
i'm
protesting”.
or
something
this,
if
i
haven't
broken
any
law,
this
is
no
reason.
but
i
only
mentioned
this
to
show
as
a
part
of
the
intent
in
the
statute
when
it
says
with
a
mischievous
and
malicious
intent
and
would
contend
that
that
is
what
this
goes
to.
the
other
point,
which
is
the
lack
of
relevant
evidence,
i
think
that
it
was
treated
the
point
before.
and
also,
the
petitioners
have
said
that
this
was
the
use
of
“a
petty
criminal
statute”
to
prohibit
or
to
hinder
people
in
exercising
their
rights.
one
of
these
statutes
was
not
passed
during
any
--
this
statue
has
been
on
the
books
for
a
long
time.
in
fact,
florida
has
not
passed,
to
my
knowledge
except
for
the
schools
which
of
course
were
unconstitutional
has
not
passed
any
laws
about
or
any
additional
laws
in
the
last
10
years,
making
it
unlawful
to
stand
in
a
public
building
after
being
ordered
to
leave
or
making
unlawful
to
go
in
sidewalks
or
anything
else.
so
certainly,
by
the
very
fact
that
this
statute
is
an
old
statute,
and
i'm
not
contending
this
because
it's
old
it's
good
but
it
hasn't
been
tested
in
that
regard.
and
certainly,
this
was
not
attempt
on
the
part
of
florida
to
use
a
petty
criminal
statute,
just
to
prosecute
this
people.
now,
if
of
course
the
statute
is
no
good,
maybe
we
should
have
passed
some
of
the
statute.
but
we
contend
this
was
under
the
circumstance,
the
only
statute
that
could
have
been
used
under
our
statutory
law
and
may
be
this
is
a
failure
of
the
legislature
not
to
pass
that
statute
in
this
regard.
but
the
state
of
florida
has
been
fairly
fortunate
in
this
area
and
is
not
deemed
it
necessary
to
pass
to
allow
the
statutes
which
by
the
way,
have
most
been
thrown
anyway
by
this
court.
so,
it
would
really
have
been
unused
just
to
pass
it
and
we're
proud
we
didn't
have
it.
mr.
william
d.
roth
to
prove
that
isn't
the
conduct,
yes,
sir.
well,
by
the
--
i
think
that
both
words
can
be
or
this
can
be
shown
that
--
the
part
of
malicious
and
mischievous
can
be
shown
in
the
fact
that
petitioner,
upon
arriving
in
this
spot,
showed
that
they
wanted
to
be
arrested.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
i
said
--
i
said
that
in
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
well
that
is
in
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
i
said
that
that's
specifically,
i
didn't
think
would
allow
someone
be
arrested
just
because
i
showed
that
this
is
part
and
partial.
first
of
all
that.
second
of
all,
the
collectively
it
was
--
that
was
had
between
the
sheriff
and
the
two
student
leaders,
asking
them
to
leave
and
the
student
leaders
just
responding
by
sitting
down
on
the
ground,
most
of
them.
and
thirdly,
by
the
sheriff
then
asking
everyone
to
please
leave
that
this
was
a
trespass
and
if
you
don't
leave,
you're
going
to
be
arrested
for
it.
now,
we
certainly
contend
that
the
state
of
florida
has
a
power
to
do
this.
this
--
this
court
may
say
the
statute
is
not
good
and
you
will
have
to
pass
one
but
certainly,
we
have
this
power.
the
problem
just
may
be
that
this
is
not
the
statute
to
do
it
but
certainly,
we
contend
that
florida
has
this
power
to
do
this
or
a
county
has
a
power
to
do
this
in
the
orderly
paneling
of
the
day
to
day
facilities
of
the
jail.
so
we
contend,
your
honor,
that
this
combination
of
those
three
things.
what
the
sheriff
said
to
the
petitioners
talking
to
them,
the
evidence
contend
from
some
other
of
the
petitioners
or
from
the
group
there
saying
that,
“we
came
to
be
arrested”,
and
“why
didn't
they
arrest
us
last
night”
or
something
to
that
effect
and
then
the
fact
that
petitioners
made
no
effort
to
leave
but
in
fact,
when
asked
to
leave,
sat
down.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is.
i
don't
think
that
mr.
white
said
or
mr.
blue
said
that.
mr.
william
d.
roth
well,
the
record
showed,
i
think
that
one
of
the
men,
mr.
blue
was
sitting
down
at
the
time
that
he
was
talking
to.
but
as
far
as
specifically,
these
32
petitioners,
no
there
is
none.
mr.
william
d.
roth
yes.
mr.
william
d.
roth
your
honor,
the
record
is
silent
as
to
that
and
i
didn't
take
any
part
in
the
prosecution
and
i
don't
know
--
mr.
william
d.
roth
no,
sir.
the
only
thing
in
that
regard
is
one
of
the
deputy
sheriffs
said
that
through
pictures
and
fingerprints,
these
32
were
identified.
this
i
--
it
is
unclear
to
me
exactly
what
is
that
mean
but
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
william
d.
roth
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
