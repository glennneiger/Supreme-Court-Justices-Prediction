mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
your
motion
is
granted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
how
large
the
area
was,
the
open
area
around
the
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
i
didn't
get
your
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
about
the
other
70,
what
happened
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
they
were?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
your
courts
determined
before
this
event
that
this
statute,
this
trespass
statute
should
be
interpreted
as
including
public
property
as
well
as
private
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
in
this
case
that
they
determined
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
there
were
any
prohibitions
against
the
public
generally
being
on
this
property
where
these
people
were?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
anyone
of
these
32
who
were
convicted
were
the
ones
who
said
they
want
to
be
arrested?
chief
justice
earl
warren
somebody
said
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
big
is
the
jail
is
it,
mr.
roth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
tell
us,
mr.
roth
about
how
large
the
public
area
is
around
that
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
large
it
is
the
grassy
part?
chief
justice
earl
warren
white
and
blue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
punishment
that
was
inflicted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
roth,
as
i
understand
it
that
this
block
or
square
where
these
people
were
was
a
public
block
or
square
on
which
were
buildings
of
several
departments
of
the
county
government,
there
was
a
jail
and
i
thought
you
told
us
also
that
there
was
a
probation
department
and
i
thought
also
you
said
there
was
a
health
department
and
some
parking
facilities
for
those
who
were
doing
business
with
those
agencies
of
the
government
and
then
some
general
parking
space
around
there
and
lawn.
that
--
is
that
all
about
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
division
of
responsibility
for
these
properties
as
much
as
you
say
well
this
much
is
for
the
–
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
probation
department,
this
is
under
the
health
department,
this
is
under
the
sheriff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
roth,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question.
your
statute
provides
that
it
is
unlawful
to
trespass
upon
the
property
of
another
committed
with
a
malicious
and
mischievous
intent.
now,
could
you
just
detail
in
a
moment
what
evidence
there
was
to
show
a
malicious
and
mischievous
intent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
that
can
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
any
difference
unless
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
was
specific
violation
that
that
would
amount
to
anything?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
that
there
is
anything
in
the
evidence
to
show
that
anyone
of
these
petitioners
in
this
case
were
the
ones
who
said,
“we
came
to
get
arrested.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
sat
down,
these
two
or
anyone
from
this
group?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
(inaudible).
now,
would
you
tell
me
this,
you
arrested
originally
a
106
or
105
whatever
the
number
was,
they
were
all
incarcerated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
all
taken
in
a
jail.
now,
by
what
process
that
they
call
out
of
32
of
these
people
and
say,
“these
we
will
prosecute;
the
other
70
we
will
let
go.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
mr.
roth
that
would
show
that
these
people
did
anymore
than
the
other
70
whom
they
turned
loose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
