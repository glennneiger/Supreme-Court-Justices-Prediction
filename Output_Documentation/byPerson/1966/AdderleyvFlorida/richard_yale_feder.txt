mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
first
like
to
present
and
move
the
admission
of
the
honorable
william
d.
roth,
attorney
general
staff
of
the
state
of
florida
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
conviction
of
32
negro
petitioners
who
were
convicted
of
trespass
with
a
malicious
and
mischievous
intent
in
violation
of
a
florida
statute.
the
question
presented
is,
whether
that
conviction
violated
their
constitutionally
protected
rights,
due
process,
equal
protection
and
the
right
to
freedom
of
speech,
petition
and
assembly.
where
the
trespass
alleged
was
their
presence
on
an
open
public
piece
of
property
adjacent
to
a
county
jail
and
where
the
alleged
maliciousness
and
mischievousness
was
their
peacefully
and
orderliness
in
protesting,
both
the
segregated
facilities
of
the
county
jail
itself
and
the
prior
arrest
of
their
fellow
florida
a
&
m
university
students
the
day
before
for
picketing
to
gain
admittance
to
the
all0white
movie
theaters
in
tallahassee.
all
of
these
happened
in
september
of
1963,
slightly
less
than
a
year
before
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act.
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
don't
think
are
in
dispute.
they
established
clearly
that
200
students
at
florida
a
&
m
decided
to
walk
downtown
in
tallahassee,
florida
to
protest
the
segregated
facilities
of
their
own
county
jail
and
wherein
their
own
fellow
students
were
kept
and
segregated
jail
cells
for
having
attempted
to
gain
admittance
to
an
all-white
movie
theater.
they
walked
through
the
downtown
area
of
tallahassee
and
they
arrived
at
the
county
jail
grounds
which
is
roughly
–
the
record
discloses,
about
seven
blocks
from
the
main
downtown
section
of
tallahassee
and
from
the
courthouse.
they
got
to
within
about
one
and
a
half
or
two
feet
of
the
bottom
step
of
the
entrance
of
the
jail.
at
this
point,
the
chief
jailer
testified
they
were
orderly,
they
were
singing
“oh,
freedom”
and
other
freedom
song
and
they
were
clapping
their
hands.
he
asked
them
as
they
got
to
within
one
and
a
half
feet
and
no
closer
to
move
to
another
area,
grassy
areas
surrounding
the
jail.
and
they
moved
to
the
area
he
directed
them.
there
was
a
diagram
drawn
and
as
i
recall
on
the
record,
there
was
no
measurement
in
the
record
and
there
was
simply
a
picture
drawn
on
the
blackboard
and
someone
forgot
to
ask
the
question
of
how
far
away
this
was.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record.
but
i
gather
it's
the
grassy
lawns
on
the
sidewalk
probably
within
a
hundred
feet;
but
i
don't
know,
i
can't
point
anyway.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
--
i
can't
agree
because
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
don't
believe
that's
on
the
record
either,
mr.
chief
justice,
other
than
that
there
was
two
parking
lots,
sidewalks
around,
and
lawn.
what
width
and
distance,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish.
what
the
record
does
establish,
there
were
200
petitioners
and
40
policemen
and
highway
patrolmen
and
deputy
sheriffs
around
them.
and
there
is
no
mention
that
this
blocked
the
sidewalk
or
the
street.
so
that
i
gather
it
was
a
fairly
large
area
but
the
dimensions
of
which
i
cannot
advise
the
court.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
this
was
a
county
jail.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
it
does
not,
sir.
there
was
evidence
in
this
record
that
not
only
did
the
presence
of
the
petitioners
and
their
fellow
students
not
interfere
with
the
jail
guards
but
that
business
went
on
as
usual
on
the
jail,
this
was
testified
to
both
by
the
chief
jailer
and
by
sheriff
joyce
when
he
arrived.
he
was
not
on
the
scene
when
the
petitioners
first
arrived.
there
was
a
delivery
man
who
entered
to,
i
believe
test
the
vending
machines
on
presumes
of
cigarettes
of
coffee
and
candy
and
the
like.
he
was
not
prevented
from
entering.
meanwhile,
back
at
the
circuit
courthouse,
the
sheriff,
sheriff
joyce
was
discussing
with
the
circuit
judges
a
pending
lawsuit
-
this
is
on
the
record
-
brought
against
him
for
contempt
for
his
encouraging
the
private
places
of
public
accommodation
in
tallahassee
to
discriminate
against
colleague.
and
he
immediately
know
that
this
particular
protest,
the
presence
of
these
students
at
the
jail,
was
the
protest
to
the
arrest
a
day
before
of
their
fellow
students
who
tried
to
get
an
admittance
to
the
all-white
movie
theater.
and
he
rushed
to
the
jail.
he
testified
he
arrived
and
immediately
checked
the
jail.
this
was
his
prime
question
and
found
everything
was
working
along
smoothly
and
undisturbed
in
jail.
he
then
watched
the
petitioners
for
a
while,
came
out
and
then
he
directed
the
petitioners
to
move
to
another
area.
again,
no
identification
of
what
the
area
was,
but
an
admission
by
the
sheriff
that
upon
his
request,
the
petitioners
and
the
fellow
students
moved
to
that
area.
after
watching
for
about
10
minutes,
he
testified
he
approached
two
people
whom
he
called
the
“leaders”;
one
of
them
is
the
petitioner,
petitioner
blue,
one
of
whom
was
not
a
defendant
below
and
he's
not
a
petitioner
here.
and
it
was
these
individuals
“leader”,
who
was
not
a
defendant,
who
allegedly
refused
to
advice
his
fellow
students
to
move.
the
sheriff
then
waited
another
eight
or
ten
minutes
in
accordance
with
his
testimony.
and
for
the
first
time
spoke
to
the
entire
group
of
200
students
and
said,
“you
are
trespassing.
if
you
don't
move,
you
will
be
under
arrest
for
trespass.
and
if
you
resist
arrest,
you
will
be
charged
with
the
additional
charge
of
resisting
arrest.”
mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
it
is.
the
statute
in
question
says,
“every
trespass
upon
a
property
of
another
with
a
malicious
and
mischievous
intent
is
punished
by
a
certain
fine.
that's
what
it
said.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
are
dealing
with
the
general
nonspecific
statute.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
upon
property
without,
mr.
justice
brennan.
there's
no
identification
that
it
says,
“state
property”
it's
just
property
of
another.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
this
was
public
property.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
justice
brennan
that
was
the
interpretation
given
by
the
second
court
which
is
the
appellate
court
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
was
the
grassy
area
and
sidewalk
outside
and
adjacent
to
the
county
jail.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
this
is
public
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
either
was
part
of
the
jail,
the
sidewalk
within
the
part
of
the
public
sidewalk
property
of
the
county.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
black,
i
heard
anything?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
presume
so
from
the
testimony
of
this
grassy
area.
but
there's
no
identification
to
that.
there
was
no
protest
other
than
the
one
they
first
marched
up
or
walked
up
actually,
on
the
jail
itself.
they
never
got
closer
than
by
one
and
a
half
feet
from
the
bottom
step
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
was
a
driveway
on
which
some
of
the
petitioners
were
standing
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
when
they
first
came
in
not
when
they
were
told
that
if
they
didn't
move
that
they'll
be
charged
of
trespassing.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
from
the
--
there's
a
walk
way
up
to
the
front
step
to
a
portion
of
the
driveway
leading
to
the
parking
lot
and
to
this
grassy
area
inside
it.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
does
reveal
that
high.
at
this
point,
the
sheriff
then
said
after
waiting
eight
of
ten
minutes,
“leave
or
be
arrested”.
he
then
watched
a
current
of
time
which
in
his
words
amounted
to
either
one
minute
or
two
minutes
or
three
minutes.
and
i
believe
in
one
point,
he
even
went
as
far
as
say
four
minutes.
he
then
saw
some
of
the
group
sit
down.
he
saw
some
of
the
group
right
as
they
sit
down.
the
testimony
of
one
the
petitioners
was
that
she
had
a
sweater.
she
had
–
on
the
ground,
she
went
down
to
get
her
sweater
and
at
the
time
she
was
up,
there
was
a
hand
on
her
and
saying,
“you
are
under
arrest.
come
with
me.”
and
she
went
quietly,
nonviolent.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
is
no
evidence
on
this
record
of
exclusion
of
anyone
from
this
area.
in
fact,
i
believe
there
is
evidence
on
the
record
that
other
people
watching
this
group
in
this
area
and
the
sheriff
said
they
were
not
connected
with
the
demonstration,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
though
i
don't
think
the
people
of
tallahassee
which
is
the
capital
of
florida
(voice
overlap)
is
so
small
country
jail.
but
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
far
as
the
fact
that
it
was
being
open
and
used
by
public,
i
believe
the
state
in
its
answer
in
response
admits
that
this
was
a
general
open
area
that
as
far
as
someone
walking
by
would
presume
it's
a
public
sidewalk
we
a
right
to
walk
on.
there's
no
sign,
no
fence,
no
nothing.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
and
the
grassy
area.
there
was
no
sign,
“keep
off
the
grass”
in
this
particular
case.
in
tallahassee,
they
walk
on
the
grass,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
the
only
--
no,
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
clark,
the
only
testimony
that
by
possibly
be
construed
in
this
respect,
we
have
clear
evidence
from
the
chief
jailer
that
the
entrances
were
not
blocked.
we
have
the
testimony
that
this
vending
machine
operator
would
drove
up
on
his
truck
to
fill
cigarettes
and
coffee
and
candy,
walked
out
to
the
front
door
as
if
to
leave
and
stopped.
now
the
state
likes
to
presume
from
that
that
he
was
prevented
from
leaving
because
they
were
blocking
the
driveway.
however,
on
two
occasions,
the
petitioners
were
asked
to
move
and
they
moved
on
both
occasions.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
the
only
testimony
as
far
as
i
read
the
record
was
that,
he
came
to
the
door
and
didn't.
a
question
was
asked:
“could
he
have?”
it
was
objected
to
and
never
asked
to
refrain
in
the
proper
manner.
so
we
don't
know
whether
he
stood
to
watch
this
protest
as
there
were
other
people
watching
or
whether
he
physically
could
not
leave.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish
that
the
driver
attempted
to
leave
and
couldn't
or
was
prevented
from
leaving.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
were,
in
the
testimony
of
the
chief
there
are
about
200
or
so
--
32
of
them
were
the
defendants
and
the
petitioners
herein.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
was
testimony
of
the
sheriff
that
there
are
some
did
sit
down
on
the
ground
but
there
was
no
identification
that
it
was
any
of
the
32
petitioners.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
the
record
shows
that
these
40
highway
patrolmen,
deputy
sheriffs
and
policemen
simply
closed
in
on
the
part
of
the
group
and
marched
them
right
into
the
jail.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
they
picked
out.
i
think
the
sheriff
said
that
he
thought
they
had
a
109
and
someone
else
he
had
saw
standing
on
the
steps
counting
only
got
106
and
someone
else
said
there
were
a
108.
i
wonder
whether
there
was
some
escaping
that
they
were
bringing
and
i
don't
know.
you
don't
have
an
accurate
count?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
was
testimony
from
one
of
the
deputy
sheriffs
that
he
heard
someone
saying
without
identification
of
who
was
the
one
saying
it,
that
they
had
come
down
to
be
arrested.
the
state
seems
to
infer
from
this
that
this
means
that
this
people
came
down
and
knowing
they
were
breaking
the
law.
however,
this
does
not
appear
on
the
record
rather
it
appears
on
the
fact
that
they
obeyed
a
request
to
move
to
an
area
twice,
willingly
and
quickly.
in
fact,
the
chief
jailer
said
they
move
as
quickly
as
200
people
could
possibly
move.
but
it
was
rather
a
desire
to
protest
the
prior
arrest
of
their
friends
who
had
been
arrested
the
day
before
for
picketing
in
theaters
and
that
if
protesting
the
prior
arrest
would
mean,
they
would
get
arrested,
they
were
willing
to
be
arrested.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish
that
this
people
came
down
to
enter
into
the
jail.
in
fact,
when
they
got
to
one
and
a
half
feet
away
and
told
to
stop
they
moved
back.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
again,
mr.
justice
brennan,
what
i
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
is
that,
there's
a
second
reference
later
on
in
the
record
by
another
deputy
sheriff
that
he
overhead
some
of
this
people
saying,
“we
came
to
be
arrested”.
this
is
what
the
record
contains
as
arrest.
it
simply
that
they
came
here
to
protest
and
if
arrest
is
what
would
be
the
final
result
they
would
be
arrested.
they
did
so
quietly
and
marched
even
as
the
sheriff
says,
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
really
don't
recall,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
the
state
after
spending
the
time
in
trying
these
32
dropped
the
balance
of
the
trial.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
believe
they
stayed
in
jail.
the
balance
of
the
70
individuals.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
as
i
recall,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
were
incarcerated.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
and
then
released
later
on.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
as
i
recall,
that
is
the
factual
statistic.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
sir.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
nor
is
there
any
indication
that
anyone
of
them
had
been
arrested
before
for
trespassing
on
public
property.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no.
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
there
was
testimony,
i
believe,
of
marching
and
parades
and
cox
is
not
here.
though,
i
think
cox
does
apply
since
you
have
a
general
vague
nonspecific
statute,
here
was
in
cox
you
had
a
specific
statute
prohibiting
even
the
appearance
on
a
state-owned
property.
herein
this
is
--
there
is
no
such
indication
of
this
statute
that
every
trespass
upon
the
property
of
another
has
been
a
direct
trespass.
you
have
the
complete
openness
of
the
area
and
you
have
the
too
express,
direct
request
of
the
sheriff
and
the
chief
jailer
to
go
to
a
particular
area
while
they
were
protesting
under
a
band
of
both
of
those
directions
to
protest
in
the
directed
to
area.
the
only
purpose
of
this
statute
in
this
conviction
was
to
prevent
and
proscribe
and
prohibit
the
peacefully
expression
of
opinion
contrary
to
that
of
the
sheriff.
mr.
richard
yale

i'm
making
on
--
if
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
am
making
argument
as
to
vagueness
mr.
justice
brennan
not
as
to
vague
on
its
face
but
they
as
applied
to
these
facts,
the
state
court
has
indicated
that
property
of
another
does
includes
state
property
and
we
are
not
raising
that
that
is
an
improper
state
rule.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
that
an
individual
who
sees
this
sidewalk
and
grass,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
that
statute
is
covering
this
area.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
because
it's
open
to
the
public
and
because
he
was
directed
to
go
there
by
a
public
official.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
think
it's
even
more
compelling
in
cox.
in
cox,
you
have
the
individual
say,
“stop!
go
no
further”.
well
here,
you
have
an
individual
saying,
“no,
go
to
a
different
location”.
and
they
go
to
that
location.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes.
no
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
he'd
never
said,
mr.
justice
harlan,
“get
off
in
ten
minutes”
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
well,
he
never
gave
a
time
there.
he
merely
said,
“you're
supposed
to
leave
or
be
arrested
for
trespass
and
if
you
resist
arrest,
we
deployed
police
around,
you'll
be
charged
with
resisting
arrest.
he
then
said
he
watched.
and
when
he
saw
someone
sit
down,
he
took
that
as
an
indication
that
everybody
was
going
to
sit
down
and
said,
“you're
under
arrest!”
this
was
a
matter
of
possibly
a
minute.
and
there
is
testimony
on
this
record
from
two
of
the
petitioners;
one
of
them
said
that
he
just
bend
down
to
get
a
sweater,
to
obey
the
sheriff.
but
at
the
time
she
dusted
it
off
from
the
leaves
of
the
grass,
there
was
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
there
was
another
who
said
she
has
turned
to
leave
and
saw
these
policemen
staring
at
her;
she
was
afraid
being
faced
with
the
alternative
the
sheriff
gave
them
of
being
charged
with
resisting
arrest
if
she
attempts
to
go
by.
so,
she
just
do.
highway
patrolmen
and
deputy
sheriffs
moved
them
right
into
the
basement
of
the
jail.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
did
not.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
thought
that
it
made,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan.
another,
meaning
an
individual
or
not
all
of
us
including
myself
since
i
do
have
an
interest
in
public
property.
but
i
think
i
do
for
tallahassee.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
absolutely
none,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
state
admits
in
its
brief
and
it's
in
the
record.
no
such
implied
or
expressed
indication
to
anyone
walking
down
that
he
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
be
in
nashville.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
in
answer
specific
to
your
question,
they
came
down
to
protest
and
to
take
arrest
at
that
time.
part
of
what
you
read,
your
honor,
was
asked
what
occurred
the
night
before
of
someone
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
--
i
can
only
say
that
the
testimony
of
his
both
superiors,
the
chief
jailer
and
the
sheriff,
was
in
conflict
of
this
because
they
say
there
was
no
attempt
to
enter
the
jail.
there
was
no
attempt
to
go
into
the
jail.
the
only
one
who
said
they
came
close
was
the–
chief
jailer
who
said
they
came
within
one
and
a
half
feet
and
move
back
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
understood
it
as
a
desire
to
be
arrested
if
they
came
to
that
as
a
protest
to
the
state
enforced
segregation
or
state
encouraged
segregation
in
tallahassee.
and
that
suddenly,
the
testimony
of
the
others
that
they
never
attempted
to
go
in
the
jail,
both
the
sheriff
and
the
chief
jailer,
and
moved
quietly
and
quickly
which
seem
to
refute
an
indication
that
this
particular
witness
may
have
thought
otherwise.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
other
that
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
that
the
police
closed
in
and
somewhere
in
these
107
was
the
people
who
had
been
talking.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
and
in
all
fairness,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
sheriff
did
testify
to,
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
read
earlier
of
one
of
the
petitions
of
mr.
blue,
who
said
something.
not
the
same
thing
but
there
was
that
testimony.
i
shall
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
i
have
left
in
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
this
was
the
32
trial.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
know
there
were
flying
lawyers
up
from
miami
to
handle
the
defense
of
this.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it's
“malicious”
and
“mischievous”
intent.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
the
motion
as
i
recall
made
at
the
end
of
the
state's
case,
at
the
end
of
the
entire
case
and
on
the
appeal
was
always
or
rather
didn't
go
to
any
of
them
rather
than
specifically
each;
that
there
was
no
proof
of
the
malicious
and
mischievous
intent
as
to
any
of
them.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
two
hundred.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
as
i
understand
with
the
law,
they
will
have
to
establish
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
law.
that's
why
they
kept
saying
(voice
overlap)
overheard
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
or
any.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
have
not
made
such
point.
nowhere
was
it
read
in
the
law,
mr.
justice
fortas
if
that
was
your
question.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
was
not
read
in
the
law.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
you
may
have
five
minutes
to
conclude
your
argument.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
roth.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
doesn't
appear
on
the
record.
other
than
that,
there
was
a
sentence.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
do
not
know
in
my
own
personal
knowledge.
i
was
not
at
the
original
criminal
proceedings.
i'm
given
the
case
to
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
presume
i
could
justice
black.
all
i
know,
i
believe
it's
the
opening
statement
of
the
second
court
says,
“this
is
an
appeal
from
the
sentence.”
mr.
richard
yale
feder
that's
all
there
is
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
i
don't
have
any
personal
knowledge
to
enlighten
the
court.
i
was
questioning
counsel's
comment
about
the
difference
between
cox
and
edwards
and
the
case
at
bar
in
the
absence
of
permission.
in
the
first
place
as
i
recall
in
edwards,
there
was
no
specific
permission
given
in
the
edwards
case.
and
in
the
case
at
bar,
he
admits
that
at
the
time
petitioners
came
on
the
property,
they
needed
no
permission.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
i
did
not,
justice
brennan.
i
believe,
as
i
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
--
as
i
answered
you
previously,
we
did
not
raise
the
bouie
case.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
we
raised
it
only
as
used
in
the
garner
case
and
i
believe
in
the
peterson,
the
lombard
and
the
shuttlesworth
cases.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
we
did
not
raise
that,
your
honor.
if
the
petitioners
have
the
right
to
be
where
they
were,
and
this
was
not
a
trespass
as
the
state
admits
then
no
permission
was
necessary
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
talking
now
of
their
original
walking
upon
the
grounds.
the
state
has
said
that
that
was
not
a
trespass.
as
i
understand,
the
state
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
believe
i
am,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
i
am
raising
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
believe
we've
raised
that
in
our
brief
in
the
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
we
raised
it,
as
i
say
after
edwards
and
cox
but
did
not
cite
the
bouie
case,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
our
point
is,
that
the
use
of
the
statute
which
on
its
face
to
anyone
reading
it
in
an
area
which
is
open
to
the
public,
there
be
no
way
of
their
knowing
in
advance
that
what
they
were
doing
was
improper
until
the
sheriff
or
anyone
else
should
pick
a
moment
to
say,
“this
is
trespass.
you
must
leave
or
be
arrested.”
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
sorry,
i
apologize
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
justice
black,
i
may
have
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
may
have
misunderstood,
counsel,
but
i
forthwith
stated
since
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
200
people
did
walk
up
to
within
two
feet
of
the
jail.
and
i
believe
the
state
stated
at
that
point
there
was
no
trespass.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
agree,
mr.
stewart
so
i
thought
it
was
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
believe
that
could
have
been.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
think
once
you
go
into
jail
if
there's
a
disturbance.
i
think
a
sheriff
would
have
a
right.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
standing
alone?
no,
i
believe
that
private
citizen
has
a
right
to
walk
into
a
public
building.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
depend
on
the
size
of
the
jail?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i've
never
seen
this
one
and
i
hope
i
don't,
but
the
only
other
comment,
i
noticed
my
time,
is
just
to
say
that
this
statute,
as
counsel
says,
was
on
the
books
since
1880
has
never
been
used
before.
it
has
never
used
since
other
than
prevent
these
32
florida
a&m
students
from
protesting
the
segregated
facilities
of
the
county
jail
and
the
enforcement
of
private
discrimination
in
a
movie
theater
in
tallahassee.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
agree,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
i
would.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
i
will,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
will.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
first
like
to
present
and
move
the
admission
of
the
honorable
william
d.
roth,
attorney
general
staff
of
the
state
of
florida
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
conviction
of
32
negro
petitioners
who
were
convicted
of
trespass
with
a
malicious
and
mischievous
intent
in
violation
of
a
florida
statute.
the
question
presented
is,
whether
that
conviction
violated
their
constitutionally
protected
rights,
due
process,
equal
protection
and
the
right
to
freedom
of
speech,
petition
and
assembly.
where
the
trespass
alleged
was
their
presence
on
an
open
public
piece
of
property
adjacent
to
a
county
jail
and
where
the
alleged
maliciousness
and
mischievousness
was
their
peacefully
and
orderliness
in
protesting,
both
the
segregated
facilities
of
the
county
jail
itself
and
the
prior
arrest
of
their
fellow
florida
a
&
m
university
students
the
day
before
for
picketing
to
gain
admittance
to
the
all0white
movie
theaters
in
tallahassee.
all
of
these
happened
in
september
of
1963,
slightly
less
than
a
year
before
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act.
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
don't
think
are
in
dispute.
they
established
clearly
that
200
students
at
florida
a
&
m
decided
to
walk
downtown
in
tallahassee,
florida
to
protest
the
segregated
facilities
of
their
own
county
jail
and
wherein
their
own
fellow
students
were
kept
and
segregated
jail
cells
for
having
attempted
to
gain
admittance
to
an
all-white
movie
theater.
they
walked
through
the
downtown
area
of
tallahassee
and
they
arrived
at
the
county
jail
grounds
which
is
roughly
–
the
record
discloses,
about
seven
blocks
from
the
main
downtown
section
of
tallahassee
and
from
the
courthouse.
they
got
to
within
about
one
and
a
half
or
two
feet
of
the
bottom
step
of
the
entrance
of
the
jail.
at
this
point,
the
chief
jailer
testified
they
were
orderly,
they
were
singing
“oh,
freedom”
and
other
freedom
song
and
they
were
clapping
their
hands.
he
asked
them
as
they
got
to
within
one
and
a
half
feet
and
no
closer
to
move
to
another
area,
grassy
areas
surrounding
the
jail.
and
they
moved
to
the
area
he
directed
them.
there
was
a
diagram
drawn
and
as
i
recall
on
the
record,
there
was
no
measurement
in
the
record
and
there
was
simply
a
picture
drawn
on
the
blackboard
and
someone
forgot
to
ask
the
question
of
how
far
away
this
was.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record.
but
i
gather
it's
the
grassy
lawns
on
the
sidewalk
probably
within
a
hundred
feet;
but
i
don't
know,
i
can't
point
anyway.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
--
i
can't
agree
because
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
don't
believe
that's
on
the
record
either,
mr.
chief
justice,
other
than
that
there
was
two
parking
lots,
sidewalks
around,
and
lawn.
what
width
and
distance,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish.
what
the
record
does
establish,
there
were
200
petitioners
and
40
policemen
and
highway
patrolmen
and
deputy
sheriffs
around
them.
and
there
is
no
mention
that
this
blocked
the
sidewalk
or
the
street.
so
that
i
gather
it
was
a
fairly
large
area
but
the
dimensions
of
which
i
cannot
advise
the
court.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
this
was
a
county
jail.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
it
does
not,
sir.
there
was
evidence
in
this
record
that
not
only
did
the
presence
of
the
petitioners
and
their
fellow
students
not
interfere
with
the
jail
guards
but
that
business
went
on
as
usual
on
the
jail,
this
was
testified
to
both
by
the
chief
jailer
and
by
sheriff
joyce
when
he
arrived.
he
was
not
on
the
scene
when
the
petitioners
first
arrived.
there
was
a
delivery
man
who
entered
to,
i
believe
test
the
vending
machines
on
presumes
of
cigarettes
of
coffee
and
candy
and
the
like.
he
was
not
prevented
from
entering.
meanwhile,
back
at
the
circuit
courthouse,
the
sheriff,
sheriff
joyce
was
discussing
with
the
circuit
judges
a
pending
lawsuit
-
this
is
on
the
record
-
brought
against
him
for
contempt
for
his
encouraging
the
private
places
of
public
accommodation
in
tallahassee
to
discriminate
against
colleague.
and
he
immediately
know
that
this
particular
protest,
the
presence
of
these
students
at
the
jail,
was
the
protest
to
the
arrest
a
day
before
of
their
fellow
students
who
tried
to
get
an
admittance
to
the
all-white
movie
theater.
and
he
rushed
to
the
jail.
he
testified
he
arrived
and
immediately
checked
the
jail.
this
was
his
prime
question
and
found
everything
was
working
along
smoothly
and
undisturbed
in
jail.
he
then
watched
the
petitioners
for
a
while,
came
out
and
then
he
directed
the
petitioners
to
move
to
another
area.
again,
no
identification
of
what
the
area
was,
but
an
admission
by
the
sheriff
that
upon
his
request,
the
petitioners
and
the
fellow
students
moved
to
that
area.
after
watching
for
about
10
minutes,
he
testified
he
approached
two
people
whom
he
called
the
“leaders”;
one
of
them
is
the
petitioner,
petitioner
blue,
one
of
whom
was
not
a
defendant
below
and
he's
not
a
petitioner
here.
and
it
was
these
individuals
“leader”,
who
was
not
a
defendant,
who
allegedly
refused
to
advice
his
fellow
students
to
move.
the
sheriff
then
waited
another
eight
or
ten
minutes
in
accordance
with
his
testimony.
and
for
the
first
time
spoke
to
the
entire
group
of
200
students
and
said,
“you
are
trespassing.
if
you
don't
move,
you
will
be
under
arrest
for
trespass.
and
if
you
resist
arrest,
you
will
be
charged
with
the
additional
charge
of
resisting
arrest.”
mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
it
is.
the
statute
in
question
says,
“every
trespass
upon
a
property
of
another
with
a
malicious
and
mischievous
intent
is
punished
by
a
certain
fine.
that's
what
it
said.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
are
dealing
with
the
general
nonspecific
statute.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
upon
property
without,
mr.
justice
brennan.
there's
no
identification
that
it
says,
“state
property”
it's
just
property
of
another.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
this
was
public
property.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
justice
brennan
that
was
the
interpretation
given
by
the
second
court
which
is
the
appellate
court
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
was
the
grassy
area
and
sidewalk
outside
and
adjacent
to
the
county
jail.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
this
is
public
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
either
was
part
of
the
jail,
the
sidewalk
within
the
part
of
the
public
sidewalk
property
of
the
county.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
black,
i
heard
anything?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
presume
so
from
the
testimony
of
this
grassy
area.
but
there's
no
identification
to
that.
there
was
no
protest
other
than
the
one
they
first
marched
up
or
walked
up
actually,
on
the
jail
itself.
they
never
got
closer
than
by
one
and
a
half
feet
from
the
bottom
step
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
was
a
driveway
on
which
some
of
the
petitioners
were
standing
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
when
they
first
came
in
not
when
they
were
told
that
if
they
didn't
move
that
they'll
be
charged
of
trespassing.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
from
the
--
there's
a
walk
way
up
to
the
front
step
to
a
portion
of
the
driveway
leading
to
the
parking
lot
and
to
this
grassy
area
inside
it.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
does
reveal
that
high.
at
this
point,
the
sheriff
then
said
after
waiting
eight
of
ten
minutes,
“leave
or
be
arrested”.
he
then
watched
a
current
of
time
which
in
his
words
amounted
to
either
one
minute
or
two
minutes
or
three
minutes.
and
i
believe
in
one
point,
he
even
went
as
far
as
say
four
minutes.
he
then
saw
some
of
the
group
sit
down.
he
saw
some
of
the
group
right
as
they
sit
down.
the
testimony
of
one
the
petitioners
was
that
she
had
a
sweater.
she
had
–
on
the
ground,
she
went
down
to
get
her
sweater
and
at
the
time
she
was
up,
there
was
a
hand
on
her
and
saying,
“you
are
under
arrest.
come
with
me.”
and
she
went
quietly,
nonviolent.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
is
no
evidence
on
this
record
of
exclusion
of
anyone
from
this
area.
in
fact,
i
believe
there
is
evidence
on
the
record
that
other
people
watching
this
group
in
this
area
and
the
sheriff
said
they
were
not
connected
with
the
demonstration,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
though
i
don't
think
the
people
of
tallahassee
which
is
the
capital
of
florida
(voice
overlap)
is
so
small
country
jail.
but
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
far
as
the
fact
that
it
was
being
open
and
used
by
public,
i
believe
the
state
in
its
answer
in
response
admits
that
this
was
a
general
open
area
that
as
far
as
someone
walking
by
would
presume
it's
a
public
sidewalk
we
a
right
to
walk
on.
there's
no
sign,
no
fence,
no
nothing.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
and
the
grassy
area.
there
was
no
sign,
“keep
off
the
grass”
in
this
particular
case.
in
tallahassee,
they
walk
on
the
grass,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
the
only
--
no,
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
clark,
the
only
testimony
that
by
possibly
be
construed
in
this
respect,
we
have
clear
evidence
from
the
chief
jailer
that
the
entrances
were
not
blocked.
we
have
the
testimony
that
this
vending
machine
operator
would
drove
up
on
his
truck
to
fill
cigarettes
and
coffee
and
candy,
walked
out
to
the
front
door
as
if
to
leave
and
stopped.
now
the
state
likes
to
presume
from
that
that
he
was
prevented
from
leaving
because
they
were
blocking
the
driveway.
however,
on
two
occasions,
the
petitioners
were
asked
to
move
and
they
moved
on
both
occasions.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
the
only
testimony
as
far
as
i
read
the
record
was
that,
he
came
to
the
door
and
didn't.
a
question
was
asked:
“could
he
have?”
it
was
objected
to
and
never
asked
to
refrain
in
the
proper
manner.
so
we
don't
know
whether
he
stood
to
watch
this
protest
as
there
were
other
people
watching
or
whether
he
physically
could
not
leave.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish
that
the
driver
attempted
to
leave
and
couldn't
or
was
prevented
from
leaving.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
were,
in
the
testimony
of
the
chief
there
are
about
200
or
so
--
32
of
them
were
the
defendants
and
the
petitioners
herein.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
was
testimony
of
the
sheriff
that
there
are
some
did
sit
down
on
the
ground
but
there
was
no
identification
that
it
was
any
of
the
32
petitioners.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
the
record
shows
that
these
40
highway
patrolmen,
deputy
sheriffs
and
policemen
simply
closed
in
on
the
part
of
the
group
and
marched
them
right
into
the
jail.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
they
picked
out.
i
think
the
sheriff
said
that
he
thought
they
had
a
109
and
someone
else
he
had
saw
standing
on
the
steps
counting
only
got
106
and
someone
else
said
there
were
a
108.
i
wonder
whether
there
was
some
escaping
that
they
were
bringing
and
i
don't
know.
you
don't
have
an
accurate
count?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
was
testimony
from
one
of
the
deputy
sheriffs
that
he
heard
someone
saying
without
identification
of
who
was
the
one
saying
it,
that
they
had
come
down
to
be
arrested.
the
state
seems
to
infer
from
this
that
this
means
that
this
people
came
down
and
knowing
they
were
breaking
the
law.
however,
this
does
not
appear
on
the
record
rather
it
appears
on
the
fact
that
they
obeyed
a
request
to
move
to
an
area
twice,
willingly
and
quickly.
in
fact,
the
chief
jailer
said
they
move
as
quickly
as
200
people
could
possibly
move.
but
it
was
rather
a
desire
to
protest
the
prior
arrest
of
their
friends
who
had
been
arrested
the
day
before
for
picketing
in
theaters
and
that
if
protesting
the
prior
arrest
would
mean,
they
would
get
arrested,
they
were
willing
to
be
arrested.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish
that
this
people
came
down
to
enter
into
the
jail.
in
fact,
when
they
got
to
one
and
a
half
feet
away
and
told
to
stop
they
moved
back.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
again,
mr.
justice
brennan,
what
i
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
there
is
that,
there's
a
second
reference
later
on
in
the
record
by
another
deputy
sheriff
that
he
overhead
some
of
this
people
saying,
“we
came
to
be
arrested”.
this
is
what
the
record
contains
as
arrest.
it
simply
that
they
came
here
to
protest
and
if
arrest
is
what
would
be
the
final
result
they
would
be
arrested.
they
did
so
quietly
and
marched
even
as
the
sheriff
says,
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
really
don't
recall,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
the
state
after
spending
the
time
in
trying
these
32
dropped
the
balance
of
the
trial.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
believe
they
stayed
in
jail.
the
balance
of
the
70
individuals.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
as
i
recall,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
were
incarcerated.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
and
then
released
later
on.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
as
i
recall,
that
is
the
factual
statistic.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
sir.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
nor
is
there
any
indication
that
anyone
of
them
had
been
arrested
before
for
trespassing
on
public
property.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no.
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
there
was
testimony,
i
believe,
of
marching
and
parades
and
cox
is
not
here.
though,
i
think
cox
does
apply
since
you
have
a
general
vague
nonspecific
statute,
here
was
in
cox
you
had
a
specific
statute
prohibiting
even
the
appearance
on
a
state-owned
property.
herein
this
is
--
there
is
no
such
indication
of
this
statute
that
every
trespass
upon
the
property
of
another
has
been
a
direct
trespass.
you
have
the
complete
openness
of
the
area
and
you
have
the
too
express,
direct
request
of
the
sheriff
and
the
chief
jailer
to
go
to
a
particular
area
while
they
were
protesting
under
a
band
of
both
of
those
directions
to
protest
in
the
directed
to
area.
the
only
purpose
of
this
statute
in
this
conviction
was
to
prevent
and
proscribe
and
prohibit
the
peacefully
expression
of
opinion
contrary
to
that
of
the
sheriff.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
making
on
--
if
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
am
making
argument
as
to
vagueness
mr.
justice
brennan
not
as
to
vague
on
its
face
but
they
as
applied
to
these
facts,
the
state
court
has
indicated
that
property
of
another
does
includes
state
property
and
we
are
not
raising
that
that
is
an
improper
state
rule.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
that
an
individual
who
sees
this
sidewalk
and
grass,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
that
statute
is
covering
this
area.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
because
it's
open
to
the
public
and
because
he
was
directed
to
go
there
by
a
public
official.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
think
it's
even
more
compelling
in
cox.
in
cox,
you
have
the
individual
say,
“stop!
go
no
further”.
well
here,
you
have
an
individual
saying,
“no,
go
to
a
different
location”.
and
they
go
to
that
location.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes.
no
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
he'd
never
said,
mr.
justice
harlan,
“get
off
in
ten
minutes”
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
well,
he
never
gave
a
time
there.
he
merely
said,
“you're
supposed
to
leave
or
be
arrested
for
trespass
and
if
you
resist
arrest,
we
deployed
police
around,
you'll
be
charged
with
resisting
arrest.
he
then
said
he
watched.
and
when
he
saw
someone
sit
down,
he
took
that
as
an
indication
that
everybody
was
going
to
sit
down
and
said,
“you're
under
arrest!”
this
was
a
matter
of
possibly
a
minute.
and
there
is
testimony
on
this
record
from
two
of
the
petitioners;
one
of
them
said
that
he
just
bend
down
to
get
a
sweater,
to
obey
the
sheriff.
but
at
the
time
she
dusted
it
off
from
the
leaves
of
the
grass,
there
was
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir.
there
was
another
who
said
she
has
turned
to
leave
and
saw
these
policemen
staring
at
her;
she
was
afraid
being
faced
with
the
alternative
the
sheriff
gave
them
of
being
charged
with
resisting
arrest
if
she
attempts
to
go
by.
so,
she
just
do.
highway
patrolmen
and
deputy
sheriffs
moved
them
right
into
the
basement
of
the
jail.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
did
not.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
thought
that
it
made,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan.
another,
meaning
an
individual
or
not
all
of
us
including
myself
since
i
do
have
an
interest
in
public
property.
but
i
think
i
do
for
tallahassee.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
absolutely
none,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
state
admits
in
its
brief
and
it's
in
the
record.
no
such
implied
or
expressed
indication
to
anyone
walking
down
that
he
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
be
in
nashville.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
in
answer
specific
to
your
question,
they
came
down
to
protest
and
to
take
arrest
at
that
time.
part
of
what
you
read,
your
honor,
was
asked
what
occurred
the
night
before
of
someone
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
--
i
can
only
say
that
the
testimony
of
his
both
superiors,
the
chief
jailer
and
the
sheriff,
was
in
conflict
of
this
because
they
say
there
was
no
attempt
to
enter
the
jail.
there
was
no
attempt
to
go
into
the
jail.
the
only
one
who
said
they
came
close
was
the–
chief
jailer
who
said
they
came
within
one
and
a
half
feet
and
move
back
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
understood
it
as
a
desire
to
be
arrested
if
they
came
to
that
as
a
protest
to
the
state
enforced
segregation
or
state
encouraged
segregation
in
tallahassee.
and
that
suddenly,
the
testimony
of
the
others
that
they
never
attempted
to
go
in
the
jail,
both
the
sheriff
and
the
chief
jailer,
and
moved
quietly
and
quickly
which
seem
to
refute
an
indication
that
this
particular
witness
may
have
thought
otherwise.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
other
that
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
that
the
police
closed
in
and
somewhere
in
these
107
was
the
people
who
had
been
talking.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
and
in
all
fairness,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
sheriff
did
testify
to,
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
read
earlier
of
one
of
the
petitions
of
mr.
blue,
who
said
something.
not
the
same
thing
but
there
was
that
testimony.
i
shall
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
i
have
left
in
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
this
was
the
32
trial.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
know
there
were
flying
lawyers
up
from
miami
to
handle
the
defense
of
this.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it's
“malicious”
and
“mischievous”
intent.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
the
motion
as
i
recall
made
at
the
end
of
the
state's
case,
at
the
end
of
the
entire
case
and
on
the
appeal
was
always
or
rather
didn't
go
to
any
of
them
rather
than
specifically
each;
that
there
was
no
proof
of
the
malicious
and
mischievous
intent
as
to
any
of
them.

mr.
richard
yale

as
i
understand
with
the
law,
they
will
have
to
establish
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
law.
that's
why
they
kept
saying
(voice
overlap)
overheard
--
mr.
richard
yale

or
any.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
have
not
made
such
point.
nowhere
was
it
read
in
the
law,
mr.
justice
fortas
if
that
was
your
question.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
was
not
read
in
the
law.
mr.
richard

you
may
have
five
minutes
to
conclude
your
argument.

mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
it
doesn't
appear
on
the
record.
other
than
that,
there
was
a
sentence.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
do
not
know
in
my
own
personal
knowledge.
i
was
not
at
the
original
criminal
proceedings.
i'm
given
the
case
to
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
presume
i
could
justice
black.
all
i
know,
i
believe
it's
the
opening
statement
of
the
second
court
says,
“this
is
an
appeal
from
the
sentence.”
mr.
richard
yale
feder
that's
all
there
is
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
i
don't
have
any
personal
knowledge
to
enlighten
the
court.
i
was
questioning
counsel's
comment
about
the
difference
between
cox
and
edwards
and
the
case
at
bar
in
the
absence
of
permission.
in
the
first
place
as
i
recall
in
edwards,
there
was
no
specific
permission
given
in
the
edwards
case.
and
in
the
case
at
bar,
he
admits
that
at
the
time
petitioners
came
on
the
property,
they
needed
no
permission.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
i
did
not,
justice
brennan.
i
believe,
as
i
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
--
as
i
answered
you
previously,
we
did
not
raise
the
bouie
case.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
we
raised
it
only
as
used
in
the
garner
case
and
i
believe
in
the
peterson,
the
lombard
and
the
shuttlesworth
cases.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
we
did
not
raise
that,
your
honor.
if
the
petitioners
have
the
right
to
be
where
they
were,
and
this
was
not
a
trespass
as
the
state
admits
then
no
permission
was
necessary
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
talking
now
of
their
original
walking
upon
the
grounds.
the
state
has
said
that
that
was
not
a
trespass.
as
i
understand,
the
state
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
believe
i
am,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
i
am
raising
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
believe
we've
raised
that
in
our
brief
in
the
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
no,
we
raised
it,
as
i
say
after
edwards
and
cox
but
did
not
cite
the
bouie
case,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
our
point
is,
that
the
use
of
the
statute
which
on
its
face
to
anyone
reading
it
in
an
area
which
is
open
to
the
public,
there
be
no
way
of
their
knowing
in
advance
that
what
they
were
doing
was
improper
until
the
sheriff
or
anyone
else
should
pick
a
moment
to
say,
“this
is
trespass.
you
must
leave
or
be
arrested.”
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i'm
sorry,
i
apologize
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
mr.
justice
black,
i
may
have
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
may
have
misunderstood,
counsel,
but
i
forthwith
stated
since
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
200
people
did
walk
up
to
within
two
feet
of
the
jail.
and
i
believe
the
state
stated
at
that
point
there
was
no
trespass.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
agree,
mr.
stewart
so
i
thought
it
was
--
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
believe
that
could
have
been.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
think
once
you
go
into
jail
if
there's
a
disturbance.
i
think
a
sheriff
would
have
a
right.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
standing
alone?
no,
i
believe
that
private
citizen
has
a
right
to
walk
into
a
public
building.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
depend
on
the
size
of
the
jail?
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i've
never
seen
this
one
and
i
hope
i
don't,
but
the
only
other
comment,
i
noticed
my
time,
is
just
to
say
that
this
statute,
as
counsel
says,
was
on
the
books
since
1880
has
never
been
used
before.
it
has
never
used
since
other
than
prevent
these
32
florida
a&m
students
from
protesting
the
segregated
facilities
of
the
county
jail
and
the
enforcement
of
private
discrimination
in
a
movie
theater
in
tallahassee.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
i
agree,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
i
would.
mr.
richard
yale
feder
yes,
i
will,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
will.
