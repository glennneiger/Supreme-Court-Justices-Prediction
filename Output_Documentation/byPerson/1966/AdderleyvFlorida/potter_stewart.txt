it's
a
city
jail
or
a
county
jail
or
state
prison
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
county
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
what
the
population
of
the
jail
was?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
driveway
or
something
at
this
–-
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
did
they
move
to
from
the
driveway?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
where
they
moved
to
when
requested
by
the
deputy
sheriff
to
move
away
from
steps,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
right
directly
from
the
grassy
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
would
pay
some
evidence
at
least
in
the
record
that
the
purpose
of
--
some
of
this
people
coming
down
there
was
to
get
arrested,
to
get
themselves
arrested?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
why
l
get
this.
a
107
or
whatever
that
figure
is,
106,
105.
it's
the
number
that
was
taken
into
the
jail
itself,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
on
that
group,
only
32
were
actually
prosecuted
under
the
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
convictions
under
the
test
of
statute
we
have
here
are
those
32,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anything
that
distinguished
their
conduct
from
the
other
70
other?
justice
potter
stewart
she
is
one
of
the
32?
justice
potter
stewart
you
understand
the
record
on
the
top
of
page
46
to
indicate
the
--
that
this
people
came
down
there
to
be
arrested
or
that
they
came
down
there
to
go
into
the
jail.
they
wanted
to
go
to
jail
on
a
period
to
be
directed
in
the
remarks
to
their
leader,
group
leader
that
they
have
come
to
the
jail
the
night
before
and
promised
that
they
could
go
to
jail
and
they
were
refused.
and
they
have
come
back
this
morning,
this
particular
morning,
to
go
to
jail
and
now
there
was
demanding
to
go
to
jail.
they
wanted
to
go
to
jail.
and
they
started
through
the
entrance
of
the
jail
and
myself
and
several
officers
stepped
in
and
in
between
and
blocked
them
and
at
that
time
one
of
the
ministers,
reverend
evans
came
up
and
talked
to
group
leaders
and
asked
them
to
move
back.
now,
do
you
understand
that
they
are
saying
that
they
wanted
to
just
walk
into
the
jail
or
that
they
came
down
to
be
arrested
and
be
put
in
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
did
you
hear?
what
i
read
was
what
he
heard
that
morning
and
part
of
what
he
heard
were
references
on
our
spokesman
of
the
crowd
to
the
night
before.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
my
question
and
this
is
ambiguous.
it
could
mean
either
that
they
wanted
this
storm
the
jail,
i
think
that's
exactly
an
exaggeration,
or
that
they
came
down
and
wanted
to
be
arrested
and
be
put
in
jail.
and
i
wanted
how
you
understood
it
or
how
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
reportingly
heard,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
roth,
may
i
ask
you?
do
i
understand
in
standpoint
are
you
saying
that
you
do
not
claim
that
the
entry
here
was
initially
unlawful
that
it
became
such
only
after
certiorari
if
this
continue
to
leave
when
the
sheriff
requested
them
to?
is
that
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
your
statute
says
in
other
words,
your
construing
trespass
as
i
understand
it,
that's
the
word
of
your
statute
isn't
it?
as
a
refusal
belief
even
though
the
original
entry
was
blocked,
they
refused
all
to
leave
after
being
requested
to
go,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
had
that
statute
even
been
so
construed
by
your
courts
before?
justice
potter
stewart
well
ordinarily,
didn't
trespass
done
contemplate
in
initial
unlawful
entry
on
the
property
of
another?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
we
dealt
with
the
statute
like
this
which
i
would
call
it
in
terms
of
--
as
i
read
that
opinion
even
when
i
wrote
it.
my
recollection
is
that
the
statue
there
also
said
trespass.
and
then
late
in
the
day,
the
supreme
court
at
south
carolina
interpreted
trespass
to
include,
even
though
there
was
an
initial
lawful
entry,
a
refusal
to
leave
upon
request
to
go
and
we
said
that
in
that
context,
that
was
too
vague,
this
part
of
criminal
statute.
no
eyes
onto
your
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
can
understand
that
but
even
so,
if
trespass
means
ordinarily,
and
i
think
you
can
--
you
just
told
me
you
believed
that
the
initial
entry
on
this
property
was
not
unlawful;
initially.
it
became
unlawful
only
after
they
refused
to
go
when
the
sheriff
requested
them
to
go,
is
that
what
you
are
telling
me?
well
then
if
the
initial
--
how
are
we
to
suppose
trespass
here
except
for
the
decision
in
this
case
under
your
state
law
includes
the
refusal
to
go
after
the
initial
offer?
justice
potter
stewart
the
prosecution
wasn't
under
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
just
wondering
here.
don't
you
think
our
bouie
decision
has
real
relevance
to
the
decision
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
feder,
before
you
begin.
justice
potter
stewart
what
were
the
sentences
imposed
in
this
case?
i
can't
find
in
the
record
or
anywhere.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
any
--
you
know?
is
he
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
saw
that
but
i
couldn't
find
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that's
what
mr.
roth
answered
me
when
i
asked
that
very
question.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
feder,
you
are
going
get
and
let
us
have
the
punishments
imposed
in
this
case?
justice

stewart
are
you
going
to
supply
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
information
as
to
punishment?
