mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
literal
language
of
section
7
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
the
abandonment
provision
is
going
to
be
given
effect.
section
7
(b)
says
in
terms
that
no
natural
gas
company
may
abandon
all
or
any
portion
of
its
facilities
or
any
services
rendered
thereby
without
the
commission
approval
first
obtained.
there
is
no
real
question
in
this
case
that
there
has
been
an
abandonment
of
facilities
and
of
services
rendered
by
means
of
those
facilities.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
there
was
--
it
was
raised
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
this
was
a
question
which
was
presented
to
the
commission
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
was
not
a
question
presented
to
this
court
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
question
as
i
understand
it
that
has
been
raised
by
petitioner
is
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
hasn't
been
an
abandonment
of
facilities
and
services
that
the
commission
can't
exercised
that
jurisdiction
because
there
is
an
implied
exception
because
this
would
effect
purchasing.
i
think
this
is
the
only
real
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
also
no
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
commission
in
the
circumstances
here
described
should
have
allowed
an
abandonment.
united
talks
about
the
fact
that
it
didn't
need
the
gas
and
that
the
price
was
too
high.
but
united
has
never
availed
itself
of
the
opportunity
to
seek
abandonment
juris
--
abandonment
approval
from
the
federal
power
commission.
in
the
commission
in
determining
that
united
had
to
seek
abandonment
approval
from
the
commission
also
said
that
they
were
free
at
any
time
to
request
such
authorization.
but
at
no
time
have
they
done
so.
the
--
i
would
like
to
mention
also
really
the
preliminary
matter
that
the
reasonableness
of
continental's
rate
is
not
at
issue
here.
it
is
true
that
there
was
an
increase,
a
determination
of
the
contract
from
about
10
and
three
quarter
cents
to
about
15
and
three
quarter
cent.
the
commission
did
--
permitted
this
rate
to
go
into
effect
without
suspension.
united
never
challenged
the
reasonableness.
the
particular
level
is
the
--
below
the
level
at
which
the
commission
under
its
policy
statement
will
suspend
increased
rates
and
in
the
pending
south
louisiana
area
rate
case,
no
party
has
suggested
that
the
just
and
reasonable
area
rate
is
any
less
than
this
15
and
3
quarters.
in
fact,
all
the
recommendations
are
above
that.
the
staff
of
the
commission
in
attempting
to
--
and
i
presume
properly
so
attempting
to
follow
the
commission's
decision
in
the
permian
basin
area
rate
case
has
recommended
a
area
rate
of
18
cents
which
is
about
more
than
2
cents
above
the
rate
involved
here.
so,
that
does
not
present
a
real
question.
instead
what
united
is
arguing
is
that
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation
and
its
abandonment
authority
has
to
be
read
narrowly
because
the
word
purchasing
does
not
appear
anywhere
in
the
statute.
now,
this
we
believe
is
quite
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
had
held
in
case
after
case
that
the
natural
gas
act
was
intended
to
provide
a
comprehensive
regulatory
system
over
natural
gas
companies.
the
--
there
are
exceptions
written
into
the
act
and
i
would
respect
the
production
and
gathering
and
with
respect
to
local
sales.
and
--
but
these
exceptions
don't
mean
that
the
gas
companies
are
not
subject
to
regulations.
it
means
rather
that
in
those
particular
spheres
of
interest,
they
are
subject
to
regulation
by
the
states
rather
than
by
the
federal
power
commission.
but
in
this
case,
even
though
in
the
situation
where
the
court
was
reading
the
affirmative
grant
of
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation
in
relation
--
or
i
should
say
--
this
court
has
read
the
commission's
affirmative
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation
in
relation
to
production
and
gathering
as
meaning
that
you
have
to
give
primary
effect
to
the
affirmative
grant
of
jurisdiction.
of
course
that
was
the
holding
of
the
first
phillips
case
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
power
commission
does
have
jurisdiction
over
independent
producers
notwithstanding
and
expressed
exception
over
production
and
gathering.
here,
without
any
such
expressed
exception,
united
is
asking
that
the
commission's
jurisdiction
be
severely
limited.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
--
i'm
aware
of
this
language
in
their
brief.
i
don't
think
its
really
before
this
court
because
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
petition
but
quite
aside
from
that,
the
commission
found
and
the
--
i
think
properly
so
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
united's
action
in
completely
--
in
stating
that
it
would
not
use
these
facilities
for
any
purpose
in
fact
constitutes
and
abandonment
of
certain
facilities
which
have
no
other
function
at
all.
the
commission
has
--
as
its
opinion
points
out
has
frequently
held
that
abandonment
does
not
depend
upon
the
removal
of
facilities
from
the
ground.
that
abandonment
can
result
simply
by
turning
off
a
valve
as
well
as
by
physical
removal.
in
addition
to
that
--
in
this
case
the
commission
found
that
there
was
an
abandonment
of
the
services
which
united
is
rendering
by
means
of
the
facility.
it's
a
transportation
service.
it's
a
service
or
it
was
a
service
of
delivering
gas
from
reserves
which
had
been
dedicated
by
the
producer
to
the
--
ultimately
to
the
market.
now
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes
your
honor.
it
would
not
have
been
an
abandonment
of
facilities
perhaps.
but
i
think
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
it
would've
been
of
the
services.
that's
right.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that's
not
the
statute,
it
is
very
clear
that
the
abandonment
jurisdiction
relates
to
facilities
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
and
any
service
rendered
thereby.
now,
maybe
there
are
three
services
rendered
by
means
of
the
same
facility
but
if
you
drop
one
of
those
services,
it's
a
service,
any
service
within
the
meaning
of
section
7
(b).
of
course
this
makes
very
good
sense
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
sunray
case.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
if
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes.
i
think
our
jurisdiction
depends
upon
an
abandonment
of
facilities
or
services
rendered
by
means
of
united
facilities.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
in
this
case
at
--
we
are
only
claiming
jurisdiction
based
upon
section
7
(b).
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
white
of
when
a
situation
would
exist
where
the
cessation
of
a
purchase
under
a
contract
would
not
result
in
the
abandonment
of
some
facility
or
service
rendered
thereby
but
we
do
base
our
jurisdiction
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
it's
an
academic
question
and
we
do
rest
specifically
on
section
7
(b).
in
sunray
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
problem
of
the
abandonment
was
a
broad
one
and
that
the
question
of
whether
the
rearrangement
of
purchasing
activity,
whether
one
pipe
line
should
purchase
from
a
producer
vice
versa
should
not
be
left
to
the
sole
discretion
of
the
natural
gas
companies.
but
that
this
was
something
that
in
the
public
interest
should
be
left
to
the
overwriting
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
that
is
we
suggest
the
same
--
exactly
the
same
problem
exists
here.
the
gas
act
is
concerned
with
protecting
the
ultimate
consumer
and
the
ultimate
consumer
is
not
--
is
affected
about
the
same
as
we
see
it
whether
the
pipe
line
initiates
the
discontinuance
of
the
facility,
the
service
or
whether
a
producer
initiates
such
a
discontinuance.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon
i
pointed
out
that
from
the
consumer's
point
of
view
and
the
question
of
whether
the
abandonment
is
initiated
by
pipe
line
or
a
producer
is
essentially
the
same.
united
has
suggested
that
if
the
pipe
line
purchaser
initiate
a
--
abandons
facilities
that
approval
may
not
be
needed
because
pipe
lines
have
a
self-interest
in
keeping
prices
down.
this
may
very
well
be
true
in
some
situation
and
we
do
not
say
it
isn't
but
certainly
the
history
of
regulation
does
not
suggest
as
this
court
very
well
knows
that
the
public
inadequately
protected
by
the
contracting
practices
of
pipe
lines
time
and
time
again
the
commission
in
this
court
have
found
that
the
contract
entered
into
by
pipe
line
have
resulted
in
excess
of
prices.
in
addition
to
this,
i
would
suggest
that
the
holding
in
the
sunray
case
that
the
commission
should
be
free
to
consider
all
the
factors
relating
to
an
abandonment
before
granting
a
producer
approval
to
take
gas
which
has
previously
been
committed
out
of
the
market.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
facilities
or
the
services
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
this
case
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
essentially,
it's
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
it's
the
equipment
that's
being
abandoned
and
it's
also
the
commitment
of
a
gas
supply.
well,
that's
what
the
commission
found.
i
realized
that
facilities
can
be
read
in
a
broader
sense
and
sometime
have
been
read
to
include
contracts
and
accounts
of
the
heart
for
electric
case
and
which
judge
hand
construed
facilities
in
such
a
broad
fashion.
i
don't
say
that
that
may
not
be
a
facility
but
as
far
as
this
case
and
the
problems
involved
in
this
case
are
concerned
the
commission
didn't
have
to
reach
whether
there
were
facilities
beyond
the
pipeline,
a
metering
station
or
if
not
facilities
in
some
situations
of
this
sort
or
whether
services
rendered
by
means
of
such
facilities
would
be
abandoned.
it's
--
there
may
be
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
yes.
i
think
their
knowledge
if
the
company
had
bought
gas
and
still
assumed
--
we
assume
that
they
used
exactly
the
same
equipment.
there
would
still
be
an
abandonment
here
because
the
gas
committed
under
the
continental
contract
but
it's
a
statutory
commitment,
it's
not
a
contractual
commitment.
their
gas
was
committed
from
the
continental
contract
and
this
supply
these
reserves
and
the
service
of
delivering,
transporting
these
reserves
would've
been
abandoned
so
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
if
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it's
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
controversy
doesn't
even
get
that
far
because
the
equipment
itself
or
the
facilities
are
being
abandoned
or
just
called
equipment
but
the
statute
specifically
relate
and
not
just
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
their
contention
is
i
think
that
even
if
there
is
an
abandonment
we
can't
reach
it
because
we
have
no
power
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
they
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that's
right
but
i
think
that
is
their
contention
and
i
pointed
out
yesterday
that
they're
trying
to
read
an
implied
the
exemption
with
respect
to
our
affirmative
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation.
and
they
go
on
to
stress
that
well
that
affirmative
grant
should
be
overlooked
because
that's
perfectly
plain
they
say
that
the
commission
can't
require
them
to
make
any
purchases.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
yes,
this
is
what
i
want
to
come
to.
the
--
i
do
not
say
that
the
commission
can
require
a
pipeline
to
a
--
to
initiate
a
purchase.
i
don't
think
that
question
is
--
didn't
reach
that
because
the
question
here
is
whether
we
can
require
them
to
continue
purchasing.
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
very
nature,
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
sales
of
independent
producers
necessarily
means
that
they
are
the
commission
examines
the
entire,
all
the
elements
of
the
purchase
when
the
sale
is
made.
or
either
just
the
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
and
purchase
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
that
they
make
voluntarily.
this
sale
started
voluntarily
and
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
which
they
want
to
abandon
and
as
this
court
has
also
recognized
in
the
--
for
example
in
the
case
of
transcontinental
pipeline
company
against
the
federal
power
commission
in
which
transco
sought
permission
for
transporting
gas
for
consolidated
edison
to
new
york.
in
that
case,
although
no
request
was
made
for
a
sale
certificate,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
terms
under
which
the
gas
would
be
purchased,
the
gas
that
would
be
transported
would
be
purchased
because
those
sales
conditions
were
not
within
the
public
convenience
necessity
that
this
would
at
least
one
of
the
independent
grounds
for
denying
the
transportation
certificate.
and
to
say
that
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
or
can't
exercise
its
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation
in
such
a
way
as
to
affect
purchases
just
isn't
the
case.
now,
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
was
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that
was
the
issue
in
that
case
in
the
rutherford
case
was
whether
the
producer
should
be
allowed
to
abandon
it
sale.
i
think
it
was
to
united
as
a
matter
of
fact
united
did
not
appear,
united
had
not
been
taking
gas
for
quite
awhile.
rutherford
had
a
--
before
the
philips
case
that
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
intrastate
producer
to
make
a
sale
and
wanted
to
be
relieved
of
its
obligation
to
serve
united
saying
that
united
didn't
have
any
need.
the
commission
concluded
in
that
case
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
there
presented
it
did
not
appear
that
there
was
a
need
and
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
permit
the
abandonment.
commissioner
canole
(ph)
in
that
concurring
opinion
suggested,
made
the
statement
that
you
have
read
and
i
suppose
that
statement
is
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
it
expresses
his
views
and
i
think
they
are
quite
wrong.
but
it
doesn't
represent
any
long
views
of
the
commission
and
wasn't
even
a
holding
of
the
commission
in
that
case.
in
this
case,
the
commission
once
united
comes
in
and
ask
for
abandonment
authorization
might
very
well
reach
the
same
conclusion.
the
issue
really
in
our
view
is
only
whether
it
has
to
come
in
and
ask
for
permission
or
can
it
make,
take
this
action
on
a
unilateral
basis.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
as
it
was
pointed
out
yes
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
as
i
think
was
brought
out
yesterday
in
an
answer
to
a
question
the
contention
here
is
that
even
if
united
simply
said,
we
don't
want
to
pay
as
much,
we
want
to
pay
less
that
the
argument
would
still
be
the
same.
it's
not
at
all
clear
here
that
the
facts
that
united
by
making
this
abandonment
is
really
paying
less.
the
record
shows
that
after
they
stated
that
they
would
not
buy
this
gas
at
15.75
cents
they
entered
into
some
other
purchase
contracts
at
a
higher
price
of
about
18
cents.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
about
3
cents
higher.
now,
at
least
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
initially
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
that's
--
that
could
conceivably
the
case
if
one
has
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
commission
does
have
jurisdiction
over
the
rate.
and
as
the
commission
pointed
out
in
this
case
if
for
example
continental
had
filed
a
rate
up
to
25
cents
and
this
i
mean
that
a
much
higher
rate
than
the
--
the
united
could
quickly
have
requested
abandonment
authorization
and
the
commission
very
likely
could've
granted
that
authorization
within
the
suspension
period.
and
i
think
that
really
the
--
if
you
give
the
pipe
line
a
unilateral
opportunity
to
abandon,
the
bargaining
--
there
is
no
bargaining,
they
are
the
ones
that
can
have
full
control
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
facilities
were
transferred.
i
don't
think
that
there'd
be
any
question
in
any
for
the
abandonment.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
said
that
would
at
least
be
an
abandonment
of
--
in
that
hypothetical
situation,
there
would
be
an
abandonment
of
the
service
rendered
by
means
of
those
facilities.
i
might
say
that
that
situation
is
not
the
case
here.
these
facilities
are
capable,
as
far
as
i
can
see
being
used
only
for
this
particular
purpose
at
least
there's
no
--
at
this
point,
they
are
restricted.
i
mean
there
some
facilities
that
are
restricted.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
suppose
it
is
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
held
to
be
the
case
with
respect
to
the
producer's
obligations.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
seller
--
this
--
well,
it's
not
--
this,
i
don't
know
that
it's
worst
but
at
least
it's
the
same
situation
that
the
--
in
which
the
distributors,
the
purchasers
from
the
pipeline
find
themselves
in
all
the
time,
if
you
recall
the
memphis
case
in
which
united
gas
pipe
line
sold
two
various
distributors.
this
court
agreed
where
the
federal
power
commission
that
a
pipe
line
which
had
a
service
agreement
which
permitted
to
change
rates
whenever
the
pipe
line
wanted
to
was
a
perfectly
valid
service
agreement
and
so
that
in
fact
at
this
time
like
the
all
pipe
line
sells
at
least
to
the
distributors
or
made
under
contract
if
you
will
which
permit
the
pipe
line
unilaterally
to
change
the
rates
and
so
that
while
mr.
woods
suggest
that
the
cost
can't
be
passed
on
and
conceivably
that
may
be
true
with
respect
to
some
of
these
if
they
have
direct
sale
customers.
the
normal
situation
is
that
the
pipe
line
cost
can
be
passed
on,
on
the
mere
unilateral
rate
following
of
the
pipe
line
company.
but
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
is
true
but
it
is
the
situation
in
which
the
natural
gas
industry
finds
itself
and
there
as
just
as
much
regulation
we
think
over
the
producer's
rates
is
there
over
the
pipe
line.
it's
true
they
hasn't
been
up
to
now
the
commission
has
concluded
the
first
area
rate
proceeding
and
three
others
are
well
in
progress
and
the
first
area
rate
proceeding
is
now
awaiting
decision
by
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
why
did
we
permit
the
price
to
go
into
effect
is
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
the
--
well,
in
the
sunray
case,
it
was
held
that
once
the
pipe
line's
obligations
during
the
contract
or
the
neutral
obligations
to
control
by
the
contract
after
the
contract
is
over
the
producer
may
under
the
terms
of
the
gas
act
file
for
an
increase
rate.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
as
we
believe
that
the
commission
didn't
extend
the
contract
when
the
contract
is
filed
initially,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
sunray
case
by
this
court,
the
service
is
rendered
as
the
contract
but
it
also
becomes
the
rate
schedule
which
is
legally
enforced
regardless
to
what
happens
to
the
contract.
changes
can't
be
made
without
notice
to
the
commission.
now,
the
reason
of
the
commission
didn't
permit
this
rate
to
become
into
effect
is
because
the
level
was
that
the
level
at
which
the
commission
has
allowed
all
the
rates
in
this
area
should
become
into
effect
and
while
it
was
increase
there
was
still
a
rather
low
price
and
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
they're
just
isn't
reasonable
that
this
price
has
not
been
challenged
and
nobody
in
the
area
rate
case
for
example
has
suggested
that
any
lower
price
should
be
approved.
in
many
other
cases,
if
the
rate
is
high
the
commission
might
not
allow
the
rate
to
go
in
to
effect
perhaps
because
of
the
pipe
line's
sales
pattern.
that,
we
suggest
is
the
question
for
an
abandonment
proceeding
but
it
is
not
a
question
which
relates
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
united
says
that
the
commission
cannot
compel
a
purchase
and
therefore
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
require
a
continuation
of
a
purchase.
the
commission
cannot
require
a
producer
to
initiate
a
sale
but
still
it's
well
established
that
the
commission
can
require
the
continuation
of
the
sale.
the
point
is
that
after
a
service
has
been
initiated
there
are
many
other
interests
which
become
affected
and
therefore
the
abandonment
provision
attached
for
the
reason
that
public
protection
is
required.
i
should
also
point
out
that
when
the
gas
act
was
originally
passed
in
1938,
the
abandonment
provision
existed
as
they
do
now.
they
did
not
-
the
act
at
that
time
contained
very
limited
certificate
provisions
so
that
most
sales
were
initiated
without
any
certificate
approval
but
nevertheless
once
the
service
is
commenced
they
could
not
be
withdrawn
without
commission
approval.
finally,
in
this
respect
a
reference
is
made
to
the
fact
that
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
gas
act
a
bill
had
been
proposed
to
the
congress
it's
hr
5711
which
related
to
or
which
referred
specifically
to
pipeline
purchasers
and
that
therefore
and
that
since
no
such
reference
appears
in
the
act
that
passed
that
this
shows
that
congress
didn't
want
us
to
be
able
to
control
purchases.
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
bill
in
terms
they,
the
commission
jurisdiction
only
over
natural
gas
pipeline
companies
so
that
the
only
possible
way
that
the
commission
under
the
sort
of
a
proposal
could've
treated
with
a
sales
purchase
arrangement
would've
been
from
the
purchase
side.
but
that's
became
completely
unnecessary
when
the
natural
gas
act
was
passed
giving
the
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
sale
as
such
and
i
think
just
that
nothing
in
the
gas
act
suggest
that
the
commission
would
not
intended
to
have
comprehensive
control
over
the
pipe
line
segment
of
the
industry
and
that
united
provision
would
merely
result
in
a
gap
and
would
not
support
full
protection
to
the
ultimate
consumers
which
are
the
prime
beneficiaries
under
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
it
might
very
well
be
a
waste
of
gas
if
united
is
not
required
to
take
this
gas.
at
least
the
commission
found
that
in
most
situations
there
would
be
drainage
of
this
gas
into
other
appeals
and
the
gas
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no.
there's
no
such
finding
here
because
this
was
purely
a
jurisdictional
case.
there
is
some
evidence
to
suggest
drainage
but
this
issue
was
not
really
involved
in
the
commission
proceeding
but
the
commission
did
make
the
finding
that
in
most
instances
there
would
be
there
might
also
be
wastage
because
the
facilities
are
being
unused
to
make
it
later
impossible
to
bring
the
steps
from
the
ground
at
all.
i
suggest
that
the
problem
here
is
a
jurisdictional
problem.
united
has
never
avail
itself
to
the
opportunity
to
present
all
the
facts
and
that
we
say
is
the
only
issue
does
it
have
to
come
to
the
commission
or
can
it
take
this
action
without
any
regulatory
supervision.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it
depends
somewhat
on
to
where
if
it's
drained.
it
is
considered
wastage
in
conservation
circle
i
think.
it
may
go
into
the
intrastate
market;
it
may
go
for
inferior
uses.
there
can
be
wastage.
they're
not
really
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
there's
an
overlap.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
there's
probably
a
degree
but
there
certainly
in
overlap.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
united
has
a
subsidiary
union
producing
company,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
south
louisiana
i
don't
know
that
in
the
same
general
pricing
area
and
i
may
suggest
that
they
have
an
interest
in
keeping
the
price
up
but
i
don't
know
if
they
were
selling
for
this
particular
part
of
the
service
area.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
don't
have
a
percentage.
some
pipelines
do
--
are
just
carriers
and
there
are
other
pipelines
which
are
very
substantial.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
they're
not
common
carriers.
i
don't
think
they're
common
carriers.
i
mean,
they
enter
into
a
contract.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
they're
not
obligated
to
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right.
well,
unless
there
is
a
--
unless
they
could
make
an
arrangement
with
some
other
pipe
line
which
they
might
or
might
not
be
able
to
do.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
not
in
a
normal
situation.
i
do
want
to
make
the
reservation
that
this
court
your
honor
in
the
northern
natural
ratable
take
case
says
that
the
states
could
not
have
ratable-take
orders
which
affected
the
purchase
that
indicated
that
the
commission
would
have
some
jurisdiction.
now,
to
what
extent
we
could
require
a
purchase
under
that
hasn't
been
determined
but
i
don't
want
to
disavow
that
we
couldn't
do
it
in
some
circumstances.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right.
yes,
but
most
of
the
gas
with
the
greatest
percentage
of
it.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
literal
language
of
section
7
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
the
abandonment
provision
is
going
to
be
given
effect.
section
7
(b)
says
in
terms
that
no
natural
gas
company
may
abandon
all
or
any
portion
of
its
facilities
or
any
services
rendered
thereby
without
the
commission
approval
first
obtained.
there
is
no
real
question
in
this
case
that
there
has
been
an
abandonment
of
facilities
and
of
services
rendered
by
means
of
those
facilities.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
there
was
--
it
was
raised
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
this
was
a
question
which
was
presented
to
the
commission
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
was
not
a
question
presented
to
this
court
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
question
as
i
understand
it
that
has
been
raised
by
petitioner
is
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
hasn't
been
an
abandonment
of
facilities
and
services
that
the
commission
can't
exercised
that
jurisdiction
because
there
is
an
implied
exception
because
this
would
effect
purchasing.
i
think
this
is
the
only
real
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
also
no
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
commission
in
the
circumstances
here
described
should
have
allowed
an
abandonment.
united
talks
about
the
fact
that
it
didn't
need
the
gas
and
that
the
price
was
too
high.
but
united
has
never
availed
itself
of
the
opportunity
to
seek
abandonment
juris
--
abandonment
approval
from
the
federal
power
commission.
in
the
commission
in
determining
that
united
had
to
seek
abandonment
approval
from
the
commission
also
said
that
they
were
free
at
any
time
to
request
such
authorization.
but
at
no
time
have
they
done
so.
the
--
i
would
like
to
mention
also
really
the
preliminary
matter
that
the
reasonableness
of
continental's
rate
is
not
at
issue
here.
it
is
true
that
there
was
an
increase,
a
determination
of
the
contract
from
about
10
and
three
quarter
cents
to
about
15
and
three
quarter
cent.
the
commission
did
--
permitted
this
rate
to
go
into
effect
without
suspension.
united
never
challenged
the
reasonableness.
the
particular
level
is
the
--
below
the
level
at
which
the
commission
under
its
policy
statement
will
suspend
increased
rates
and
in
the
pending
south
louisiana
area
rate
case,
no
party
has
suggested
that
the
just
and
reasonable
area
rate
is
any
less
than
this
15
and
3
quarters.
in
fact,
all
the
recommendations
are
above
that.
the
staff
of
the
commission
in
attempting
to
--
and
i
presume
properly
so
attempting
to
follow
the
commission's
decision
in
the
permian
basin
area
rate
case
has
recommended
a
area
rate
of
18
cents
which
is
about
more
than
2
cents
above
the
rate
involved
here.
so,
that
does
not
present
a
real
question.
instead
what
united
is
arguing
is
that
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation
and
its
abandonment
authority
has
to
be
read
narrowly
because
the
word
purchasing
does
not
appear
anywhere
in
the
statute.
now,
this
we
believe
is
quite
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
had
held
in
case
after
case
that
the
natural
gas
act
was
intended
to
provide
a
comprehensive
regulatory
system
over
natural
gas
companies.
the
--
there
are
exceptions
written
into
the
act
and
i
would
respect
the
production
and
gathering
and
with
respect
to
local
sales.
and
--
but
these
exceptions
don't
mean
that
the
gas
companies
are
not
subject
to
regulations.
it
means
rather
that
in
those
particular
spheres
of
interest,
they
are
subject
to
regulation
by
the
states
rather
than
by
the
federal
power
commission.
but
in
this
case,
even
though
in
the
situation
where
the
court
was
reading
the
affirmative
grant
of
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation
in
relation
--
or
i
should
say
--
this
court
has
read
the
commission's
affirmative
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation
in
relation
to
production
and
gathering
as
meaning
that
you
have
to
give
primary
effect
to
the
affirmative
grant
of
jurisdiction.
of
course
that
was
the
holding
of
the
first
phillips
case
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
power
commission
does
have
jurisdiction
over
independent
producers
notwithstanding
and
expressed
exception
over
production
and
gathering.
here,
without
any
such
expressed
exception,
united
is
asking
that
the
commission's
jurisdiction
be
severely
limited.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
--
i'm
aware
of
this
language
in
their
brief.
i
don't
think
its
really
before
this
court
because
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
petition
but
quite
aside
from
that,
the
commission
found
and
the
--
i
think
properly
so
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
united's
action
in
completely
--
in
stating
that
it
would
not
use
these
facilities
for
any
purpose
in
fact
constitutes
and
abandonment
of
certain
facilities
which
have
no
other
function
at
all.
the
commission
has
--
as
its
opinion
points
out
has
frequently
held
that
abandonment
does
not
depend
upon
the
removal
of
facilities
from
the
ground.
that
abandonment
can
result
simply
by
turning
off
a
valve
as
well
as
by
physical
removal.
in
addition
to
that
--
in
this
case
the
commission
found
that
there
was
an
abandonment
of
the
services
which
united
is
rendering
by
means
of
the
facility.
it's
a
transportation
service.
it's
a
service
or
it
was
a
service
of
delivering
gas
from
reserves
which
had
been
dedicated
by
the
producer
to
the
--
ultimately
to
the
market.
now
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes
your
honor.
it
would
not
have
been
an
abandonment
of
facilities
perhaps.
but
i
think
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--
it
would've
been
of
the
services.
that's
right.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that's
not
the
statute,
it
is
very
clear
that
the
abandonment
jurisdiction
relates
to
facilities
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
and
any
service
rendered
thereby.
now,
maybe
there
are
three
services
rendered
by
means
of
the
same
facility
but
if
you
drop
one
of
those
services,
it's
a
service,
any
service
within
the
meaning
of
section
7
(b).
of
course
this
makes
very
good
sense
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
sunray
case.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
if
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes.
i
think
our
jurisdiction
depends
upon
an
abandonment
of
facilities
or
services
rendered
by
means
of
united
facilities.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
in
this
case
at
--
we
are
only
claiming
jurisdiction
based
upon
section
7
(b).
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
white
of
when
a
situation
would
exist
where
the
cessation
of
a
purchase
under
a
contract
would
not
result
in
the
abandonment
of
some
facility
or
service
rendered
thereby
but
we
do
base
our
jurisdiction
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
it's
an
academic
question
and
we
do
rest
specifically
on
section
7
(b).
in
sunray
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
problem
of
the
abandonment
was
a
broad
one
and
that
the
question
of
whether
the
rearrangement
of
purchasing
activity,
whether
one
pipe
line
should
purchase
from
a
producer
vice
versa
should
not
be
left
to
the
sole
discretion
of
the
natural
gas
companies.
but
that
this
was
something
that
in
the
public
interest
should
be
left
to
the
overwriting
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
that
is
we
suggest
the
same
--
exactly
the
same
problem
exists
here.
the
gas
act
is
concerned
with
protecting
the
ultimate
consumer
and
the
ultimate
consumer
is
not
--
is
affected
about
the
same
as
we
see
it
whether
the
pipe
line
initiates
the
discontinuance
of
the
facility,
the
service
or
whether
a
producer
initiates
such
a
discontinuance.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon
i
pointed
out
that
from
the
consumer's
point
of
view
and
the
question
of
whether
the
abandonment
is
initiated
by
pipe
line
or
a
producer
is
essentially
the
same.
united
has
suggested
that
if
the
pipe
line
purchaser
initiate
a
--
abandons
facilities
that
approval
may
not
be
needed
because
pipe
lines
have
a
self-interest
in
keeping
prices
down.
this
may
very
well
be
true
in
some
situation
and
we
do
not
say
it
isn't
but
certainly
the
history
of
regulation
does
not
suggest
as
this
court
very
well
knows
that
the
public
inadequately
protected
by
the
contracting
practices
of
pipe
lines
time
and
time
again
the
commission
in
this
court
have
found
that
the
contract
entered
into
by
pipe
line
have
resulted
in
excess
of
prices.
in
addition
to
this,
i
would
suggest
that
the
holding
in
the
sunray
case
that
the
commission
should
be
free
to
consider
all
the
factors
relating
to
an
abandonment
before
granting
a
producer
approval
to
take
gas
which
has
previously
been
committed
out
of
the
market.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
facilities
or
the
services
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
this
case
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
essentially,
it's
the
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
it's
the
equipment
that's
being
abandoned
and
it's
also
the
commitment
of
a
gas
supply.
well,
that's
what
the
commission
found.
i
realized
that
facilities
can
be
read
in
a
broader
sense
and
sometime
have
been
read
to
include
contracts
and
accounts
of
the
heart
for
electric
case
and
which
judge
hand
construed
facilities
in
such
a
broad
fashion.
i
don't
say
that
that
may
not
be
a
facility
but
as
far
as
this
case
and
the
problems
involved
in
this
case
are
concerned
the
commission
didn't
have
to
reach
whether
there
were
facilities
beyond
the
pipeline,
a
metering
station
or
if
not
facilities
in
some
situations
of
this
sort
or
whether
services
rendered
by
means
of
such
facilities
would
be
abandoned.
it's
--
there
may
be
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
yes.
i
think
their
knowledge
if
the
company
had
bought
gas
and
still
assumed
--
we
assume
that
they
used
exactly
the
same
equipment.
there
would
still
be
an
abandonment
here
because
the
gas
committed
under
the
continental
contract
but
it's
a
statutory
commitment,
it's
not
a
contractual
commitment.
their
gas
was
committed
from
the
continental
contract
and
this
supply
these
reserves
and
the
service
of
delivering,
transporting
these
reserves
would've
been
abandoned
so
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
if
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it's
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
controversy
doesn't
even
get
that
far
because
the
equipment
itself
or
the
facilities
are
being
abandoned
or
just
called
equipment
but
the
statute
specifically
relate
and
not
just
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
their
contention
is
i
think
that
even
if
there
is
an
abandonment
we
can't
reach
it
because
we
have
no
power
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
they
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that's
right
but
i
think
that
is
their
contention
and
i
pointed
out
yesterday
that
they're
trying
to
read
an
implied
the
exemption
with
respect
to
our
affirmative
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation.
and
they
go
on
to
stress
that
well
that
affirmative
grant
should
be
overlooked
because
that's
perfectly
plain
they
say
that
the
commission
can't
require
them
to
make
any
purchases.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
yes,
this
is
what
i
want
to
come
to.
the
--
i
do
not
say
that
the
commission
can
require
a
pipeline
to
a
--
to
initiate
a
purchase.
i
don't
think
that
question
is
--
didn't
reach
that
because
the
question
here
is
whether
we
can
require
them
to
continue
purchasing.
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
very
nature,
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
sales
of
independent
producers
necessarily
means
that
they
are
the
commission
examines
the
entire,
all
the
elements
of
the
purchase
when
the
sale
is
made.
or
either
just
the
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
and
purchase
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
that
they
make
voluntarily.
this
sale
started
voluntarily
and
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
which
they
want
to
abandon
and
as
this
court
has
also
recognized
in
the
--
for
example
in
the
case
of
transcontinental
pipeline
company
against
the
federal
power
commission
in
which
transco
sought
permission
for
transporting
gas
for
consolidated
edison
to
new
york.
in
that
case,
although
no
request
was
made
for
a
sale
certificate,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
terms
under
which
the
gas
would
be
purchased,
the
gas
that
would
be
transported
would
be
purchased
because
those
sales
conditions
were
not
within
the
public
convenience
necessity
that
this
would
at
least
one
of
the
independent
grounds
for
denying
the
transportation
certificate.
and
to
say
that
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
or
can't
exercise
its
jurisdiction
over
sales
and
transportation
in
such
a
way
as
to
affect
purchases
just
isn't
the
case.
now,
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
was
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that
was
the
issue
in
that
case
in
the
rutherford
case
was
whether
the
producer
should
be
allowed
to
abandon
it
sale.
i
think
it
was
to
united
as
a
matter
of
fact
united
did
not
appear,
united
had
not
been
taking
gas
for
quite
awhile.
rutherford
had
a
--
before
the
philips
case
that
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
intrastate
producer
to
make
a
sale
and
wanted
to
be
relieved
of
its
obligation
to
serve
united
saying
that
united
didn't
have
any
need.
the
commission
concluded
in
that
case
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
there
presented
it
did
not
appear
that
there
was
a
need
and
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
permit
the
abandonment.
commissioner
canole
(ph)
in
that
concurring
opinion
suggested,
made
the
statement
that
you
have
read
and
i
suppose
that
statement
is
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
it
expresses
his
views
and
i
think
they
are
quite
wrong.
but
it
doesn't
represent
any
long
views
of
the
commission
and
wasn't
even
a
holding
of
the
commission
in
that
case.
in
this
case,
the
commission
once
united
comes
in
and
ask
for
abandonment
authorization
might
very
well
reach
the
same
conclusion.
the
issue
really
in
our
view
is
only
whether
it
has
to
come
in
and
ask
for
permission
or
can
it
make,
take
this
action
on
a
unilateral
basis.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
as
it
was
pointed
out
yes
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
as
i
think
was
brought
out
yesterday
in
an
answer
to
a
question
the
contention
here
is
that
even
if
united
simply
said,
we
don't
want
to
pay
as
much,
we
want
to
pay
less
that
the
argument
would
still
be
the
same.
it's
not
at
all
clear
here
that
the
facts
that
united
by
making
this
abandonment
is
really
paying
less.
the
record
shows
that
after
they
stated
that
they
would
not
buy
this
gas
at
15.75
cents
they
entered
into
some
other
purchase
contracts
at
a
higher
price
of
about
18
cents.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
about
3
cents
higher.
now,
at
least
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
initially
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
that's
--
that
could
conceivably
the
case
if
one
has
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
commission
does
have
jurisdiction
over
the
rate.
and
as
the
commission
pointed
out
in
this
case
if
for
example
continental
had
filed
a
rate
up
to
25
cents
and
this
i
mean
that
a
much
higher
rate
than
the
--
the
united
could
quickly
have
requested
abandonment
authorization
and
the
commission
very
likely
could've
granted
that
authorization
within
the
suspension
period.
and
i
think
that
really
the
--
if
you
give
the
pipe
line
a
unilateral
opportunity
to
abandon,
the
bargaining
--
there
is
no
bargaining,
they
are
the
ones
that
can
have
full
control
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
facilities
were
transferred.
i
don't
think
that
there'd
be
any
question
in
any
for
the
abandonment.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
said
that
would
at
least
be
an
abandonment
of
--
in
that
hypothetical
situation,
there
would
be
an
abandonment
of
the
service
rendered
by
means
of
those
facilities.
i
might
say
that
that
situation
is
not
the
case
here.
these
facilities
are
capable,
as
far
as
i
can
see
being
used
only
for
this
particular
purpose
at
least
there's
no
--
at
this
point,
they
are
restricted.
i
mean
there
some
facilities
that
are
restricted.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
suppose
it
is
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
held
to
be
the
case
with
respect
to
the
producer's
obligations.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
seller
--
this
--
well,
it's
not
--
this,
i
don't
know
that
it's
worst
but
at
least
it's
the
same
situation
that
the
--
in
which
the
distributors,
the
purchasers
from
the
pipeline
find
themselves
in
all
the
time,
if
you
recall
the
memphis
case
in
which
united
gas
pipe
line
sold
two
various
distributors.
this
court
agreed
where
the
federal
power
commission
that
a
pipe
line
which
had
a
service
agreement
which
permitted
to
change
rates
whenever
the
pipe
line
wanted
to
was
a
perfectly
valid
service
agreement
and
so
that
in
fact
at
this
time
like
the
all
pipe
line
sells
at
least
to
the
distributors
or
made
under
contract
if
you
will
which
permit
the
pipe
line
unilaterally
to
change
the
rates
and
so
that
while
mr.
woods
suggest
that
the
cost
can't
be
passed
on
and
conceivably
that
may
be
true
with
respect
to
some
of
these
if
they
have
direct
sale
customers.
the
normal
situation
is
that
the
pipe
line
cost
can
be
passed
on,
on
the
mere
unilateral
rate
following
of
the
pipe
line
company.
but
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
is
true
but
it
is
the
situation
in
which
the
natural
gas
industry
finds
itself
and
there
as
just
as
much
regulation
we
think
over
the
producer's
rates
is
there
over
the
pipe
line.
it's
true
they
hasn't
been
up
to
now
the
commission
has
concluded
the
first
area
rate
proceeding
and
three
others
are
well
in
progress
and
the
first
area
rate
proceeding
is
now
awaiting
decision
by
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
why
did
we
permit
the
price
to
go
into
effect
is
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
the
--
well,
in
the
sunray
case,
it
was
held
that
once
the
pipe
line's
obligations
during
the
contract
or
the
neutral
obligations
to
control
by
the
contract
after
the
contract
is
over
the
producer
may
under
the
terms
of
the
gas
act
file
for
an
increase
rate.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
as
we
believe
that
the
commission
didn't
extend
the
contract
when
the
contract
is
filed
initially,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
sunray
case
by
this
court,
the
service
is
rendered
as
the
contract
but
it
also
becomes
the
rate
schedule
which
is
legally
enforced
regardless
to
what
happens
to
the
contract.
changes
can't
be
made
without
notice
to
the
commission.
now,
the
reason
of
the
commission
didn't
permit
this
rate
to
become
into
effect
is
because
the
level
was
that
the
level
at
which
the
commission
has
allowed
all
the
rates
in
this
area
should
become
into
effect
and
while
it
was
increase
there
was
still
a
rather
low
price
and
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
they're
just
isn't
reasonable
that
this
price
has
not
been
challenged
and
nobody
in
the
area
rate
case
for
example
has
suggested
that
any
lower
price
should
be
approved.
in
many
other
cases,
if
the
rate
is
high
the
commission
might
not
allow
the
rate
to
go
in
to
effect
perhaps
because
of
the
pipe
line's
sales
pattern.
that,
we
suggest
is
the
question
for
an
abandonment
proceeding
but
it
is
not
a
question
which
relates
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
united
says
that
the
commission
cannot
compel
a
purchase
and
therefore
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
require
a
continuation
of
a
purchase.
the
commission
cannot
require
a
producer
to
initiate
a
sale
but
still
it's
well
established
that
the
commission
can
require
the
continuation
of
the
sale.
the
point
is
that
after
a
service
has
been
initiated
there
are
many
other
interests
which
become
affected
and
therefore
the
abandonment
provision
attached
for
the
reason
that
public
protection
is
required.
i
should
also
point
out
that
when
the
gas
act
was
originally
passed
in
1938,
the
abandonment
provision
existed
as
they
do
now.
they
did
not
-
the
act
at
that
time
contained
very
limited
certificate
provisions
so
that
most
sales
were
initiated
without
any
certificate
approval
but
nevertheless
once
the
service
is
commenced
they
could
not
be
withdrawn
without
commission
approval.
finally,
in
this
respect
a
reference
is
made
to
the
fact
that
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
gas
act
a
bill
had
been
proposed
to
the
congress
it's
hr
5711
which
related
to
or
which
referred
specifically
to
pipeline
purchasers
and
that
therefore
and
that
since
no
such
reference
appears
in
the
act
that
passed
that
this
shows
that
congress
didn't
want
us
to
be
able
to
control
purchases.
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
bill
in
terms
they,
the
commission
jurisdiction
only
over
natural
gas
pipeline
companies
so
that
the
only
possible
way
that
the
commission
under
the
sort
of
a
proposal
could've
treated
with
a
sales
purchase
arrangement
would've
been
from
the
purchase
side.
but
that's
became
completely
unnecessary
when
the
natural
gas
act
was
passed
giving
the
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
sale
as
such
and
i
think
just
that
nothing
in
the
gas
act
suggest
that
the
commission
would
not
intended
to
have
comprehensive
control
over
the
pipe
line
segment
of
the
industry
and
that
united
provision
would
merely
result
in
a
gap
and
would
not
support
full
protection
to
the
ultimate
consumers
which
are
the
prime
beneficiaries
under
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
it
might
very
well
be
a
waste
of
gas
if
united
is
not
required
to
take
this
gas.
at
least
the
commission
found
that
in
most
situations
there
would
be
drainage
of
this
gas
into
other
appeals
and
the
gas
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no.
there's
no
such
finding
here
because
this
was
purely
a
jurisdictional
case.
there
is
some
evidence
to
suggest
drainage
but
this
issue
was
not
really
involved
in
the
commission
proceeding
but
the
commission
did
make
the
finding
that
in
most
instances
there
would
be
there
might
also
be
wastage
because
the
facilities
are
being
unused
to
make
it
later
impossible
to
bring
the
steps
from
the
ground
at
all.
i
suggest
that
the
problem
here
is
a
jurisdictional
problem.
united
has
never
avail
itself
to
the
opportunity
to
present
all
the
facts
and
that
we
say
is
the
only
issue
does
it
have
to
come
to
the
commission
or
can
it
take
this
action
without
any
regulatory
supervision.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it
depends
somewhat
on
to
where
if
it's
drained.
it
is
considered
wastage
in
conservation
circle
i
think.
it
may
go
into
the
intrastate
market;
it
may
go
for
inferior
uses.
there
can
be
wastage.
they're
not
really
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
there's
an
overlap.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
there's
probably
a
degree
but
there
certainly
in
overlap.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
united
has
a
subsidiary
union
producing
company,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
south
louisiana
i
don't
know
that
in
the
same
general
pricing
area
and
i
may
suggest
that
they
have
an
interest
in
keeping
the
price
up
but
i
don't
know
if
they
were
selling
for
this
particular
part
of
the
service
area.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
don't
have
a
percentage.
some
pipelines
do
--
are
just
carriers
and
there
are
other
pipelines
which
are
very
substantial.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
they're
not
common
carriers.
i
don't
think
they're
common
carriers.
i
mean,
they
enter
into
a
contract.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
they're
not
obligated
to
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right.
well,
unless
there
is
a
--
unless
they
could
make
an
arrangement
with
some
other
pipe
line
which
they
might
or
might
not
be
able
to
do.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
not
in
a
normal
situation.
i
do
want
to
make
the
reservation
that
this
court
your
honor
in
the
northern
natural
ratable
take
case
says
that
the
states
could
not
have
ratable-take
orders
which
affected
the
purchase
that
indicated
that
the
commission
would
have
some
jurisdiction.
now,
to
what
extent
we
could
require
a
purchase
under
that
hasn't
been
determined
but
i
don't
want
to
disavow
that
we
couldn't
do
it
in
some
circumstances.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right.
yes,
but
most
of
the
gas
with
the
greatest
percentage
of
it.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
