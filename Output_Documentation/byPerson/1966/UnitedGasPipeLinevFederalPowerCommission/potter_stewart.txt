stewart
i
thought
there
was?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there's
no
question
about
that,
then
i
suppose
the
answer
in
this
case
is
clear.
but
i
thought
that
was
--
that's
what
--
one
of
the
big
questions
was.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
do
you
--
i
was
under
the
impression
that
there
was
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
an
abandonment
and
i've
now
find
it
in
the
brief
which
i
recollected.
it
says
as
follows,
united
points
out
that
in
fact
it
has
abandoned
neither
facilities
nor
reserves
when
united
ceased
purchasing
johnson
bayou
field
gas.
all
it
did
physically
was
close
a
series
of
valves.
it
removed
none
of
its
facilities
and
it
altered
none
of
them.
it
claimed
that
there
was
no
abandonment.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
there
had
been
three
producers
delivering
at
this
same
well
--
at
this
same
point
to
these
facilities?
and
this
argument
developed
just
as
between
one
of
the
producers
and
united,
would
that
--
would
the
commission
would
have
had
authority
under
7
(b)
to
force
that
purchase,
the
continuation
of
that
purchase?
would
that
one-third
abandonment
than
an
abandonment
within
the
meaning
of
7
(b)?
justice
potter
stewart
of
service.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
the
facilities
were
in
use
continually
to
--
continued
to
be
in
used
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
the
two-thirds
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
facilities
or
service
they
are
under?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
the
--
one
of
the
sellers
constructs
these
service
in
this
facility
and
constructed
all
the
facilities
necessary
to
connect
with
the
buyer's
pipe
line?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
commission's
power
here
depend
--
is
the
jurisdiction
wholly
dependent
upon
this
abandonment
of
facilities
concepts?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
rutherford
case
in
the
commission
itself
which
is
cited
and
quoted
from
--
on
page
14
and
15
of
the
petitioner's
brief
where
a
concurring
opinion
that
one
of
the
commissioners
said,
we
cannot
compel
the
pipe
line
to
purchase
gas?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
were
the
issues
in
that
case
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
it
expresses
his
views.
justice
potter
stewart
unilateral
basis
is
on
the
other
side
if
you're
right,
isn't
it?
i
mean
all
that
united
is
saying
is
we
do
not
want
buy
gas
at
this
high
price.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
our
contracts
expired
and
we
have
no
obligation
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
nobody
can
make
it
if
we
don't
want
to
buy
prior
gas
at
this
very
high
price.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
right,
if
you're
right
don't
you
take
away
any
bargaining
leverage
that
the
pipeline
might
have
after
the
expiration
of
a
contract.
don't
you
put
the
price
entirely
in
the
--
at
least
initially
subject
of
course
i
know
that
commissioner
view
but
at
least
initially
put
the
price
entirely
in
the
hand
of
the
seller.
if
there's
an
absolute
duty
on
the
part
of
the
pipe
line
to
buy
it
whatever
the
price
the
seller
takes
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
way
any
bargaining
ability
on
the
part
of
the
purchaser,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you're
right
that
abandonment
means,
as
you
answered
to
mr.
justice
black
that
simply
transferring
the
pipe
line's
business
for
these
facilities
to
another
producer,
if
that's
abandonment,
by
then
i
suppose
that's
abandonment.
but
that's,
i
didn't
understand
that
that
was
complete
agreement
on
breadth
of
that
definition
of
abandonment.
justice
potter
stewart
if
for
the
use
of
these
facilities,
the
united
simply
turn
to
another
producer
who
would
sell
his
gas
at
a
lower
price
and
thereafter
fully
utilize
these
facilities.
you
say
that
would
still
be
an
abandonment
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
black?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
even
worst
than
justice
fortas'
question
suggested,
isn't
it?
it's
the
duties
under
the
contract
continue
indefinitely
but
your
rights
end
when
the
contract
ends.
in
other
words,
your
duty
continues
to
take
the
gas
but
then
on
the
seller
after
the
expiration
of
contract
of
sellers
sets
the
price
in
which
you
take
it.
it's
worst
--
justice
potter
stewart
drainage
is
something
different
from
waste,
isn't
it?
drainage
means
no
gas
is
lost
it's
just
sold
by
somebody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
an
overlap?
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
between
the
two,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
there
was?
justice

if
there's
no
question
about
that,
then
i
suppose
the

in

is

i

that's

--
by

justice

well,
what
if

constructs

in

and
constructed
all
