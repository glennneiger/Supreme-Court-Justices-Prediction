justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
there's
some
times
when
you
could
--
when
a
pipe
line
could
quit
buying
without
having
to
abandon
some
facilities
in
the
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
no
senses
did
the
commission
say
it
had
the
power
to
prevent
you
from
--
the
pipe
line
from
ceasing
purchasing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
it
say
so
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying
what
they
know,
does
it
every
time
you
cease
purchasing
there
is
an
abandonment
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
claim
any
other
kind
of
power
over
natural
gas
--
over
pipe
line
companies,
the
purchases
of
pipe
line
companies?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
apparently
your
opponent
has
held
so
too
so
that's
just
an
academic
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
united
a
producer
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
same
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
what
extent
the
pipe
line
is
it
in
the
gas
(inaudible)
as
just
carriers?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
all
pipelines
obligated
to
carry
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
obligated
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
united
--
continental
couldn't
get
its
gas
to
market
in
the
united
pipe
line
unless
united
buys?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
most
of
the
gas
around
moves
in
the
market
by
a
purchaser
by
a
pipeline
companies?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
--
and
if
a
pipeline
companies
don't
want
to
purchase
in
the
certain
area
or
from
a
certain
producer
that
gas
isn't
going
to
reach
the
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
merely
the
--
if
the
pipe
line
goes
to
another
source
of
supply
that
were
permitted
to
but
with
another
source
of
supply
that
it
wouldn't
have
to
pay
the
same
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
an
area
of
price
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
--
was
continental
new
rate
that
that
guideline
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
for
all
practical
purposes
the
--
if
united
wanted
to
replace
this
gas
the
economic
across
it
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
got
the
old
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
they
--
should
they
buy
at
the
new
continental
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
this
that
--
would
they
say
they
got
too
much
gas,
they
can't
use
this
gas.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
isn't
that
their
contention?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
one
more
item?
i
gather
that
the
commission
would
still
take
the
same
position
it
does
even
if
there
were
no
physical
facilities
could
be
abandoned
here
at
all
that
if
all
these
facilities
actually
bring
the
gas
right
to
your
pipeline
that
belong
to
the
seller
and
all
you
did
was
say,
we
don't
want
anymore
that
we
want
to
buy
anymore
gas.
you
had
to
abandon
nothing,
they
would
still
say
you
were
abandoning
a
service,
the
service
being
the
service
of
buying
gas.
is
that
your
position
that's
why
you
want
to
understand
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
they
say
it
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
say
facilities
and
the
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you're
forced
to
go
and
buy,
and
the
price
he
has
to
pay
is
a
price
that's
fair
from
the
standpoint
of
continental
not
in
the
stand
point
of
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
commission
say
to
you
when
you
told
them
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
they
did
they
say,
we
just
don't
care
of
this
same
business,
they
didn't
say
that?
justice
byron

what
are
they're
going

say?
justice
