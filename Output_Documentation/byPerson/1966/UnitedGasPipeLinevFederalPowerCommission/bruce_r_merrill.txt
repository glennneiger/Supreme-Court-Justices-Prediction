mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
the
government
has
dressed
itself
to
the
jurisdictional
aspects
of
this
controversy.
i
address
the
court
to
make
sure
that
the
economic
and
equitable
consequences
of
this
decision
will
be
fully
understood.
this
case
is
before
this
court
because
in
many,
many
instances
gas
for
years
continues
to
produce
great
qualities
of
gas
long
years
after
the
termination
of
the
contracts
governing
the
gas
sales.
in
many
other
instances,
the
production
after
a
contract
termination
is
module.
the
question
from
an
economic
and
equitable
standpoint
as
between
the
private
parties
is
what
rule
should
govern
when
the
producer
seller
and
the
pipe
line
who
buy
do
not
reach
a
new
agreement
to
control
the
terms
under
which
continuing
gas
deliveries
will
be
made.
a
call
or
a
question
is
what
rules
will
come
closest
to
creating
bargaining
equality
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller
under
such
circumstances.
we
must
start
with
too
clearly
existing
rules
of
law.
this
court
held
in
catco
and
sunray,
that
a
producer
must
continue
to
sale
and
deliver
his
gas
after
contract
termination
unless
the
permission
on
the
commission
to
abandon
has
been
first
obtained.
now,
whether
we
producers
like
that
rule
or
not
that
is
the
law.
this
court
also
has
held
that
whether
there
is
no
contract
a
seller
may
unilaterally
file
a
rate
increase.
it
is
submitted
that
it
has
no
remedy
and
no
relief
to
producer
to
have
the
right
to
unilaterally
file
a
rate
increase
in
the
absence
of
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
bar
to
bar.
the
second
rule
does
not
hold
the
producer
harmless
from
the
consequences
in
the
first
because
the
amount
of
their
rate
becomes
a
nullity
where
is
there
is
no
sale
and
delivery.
moreover,
this
court
is
aware
that
oil
and
gas
leases
are
subject
to
forfeiture
upon
cessation
of
production
over
given
period
of
time
quite
commonly
90
days.
therefore,
a
producer
if
a
pipeline
can
choose
to
cut
off
delivery
underneath
of
time
would
not
only
suffer
drainage
and
would
not
only
suffer
the
lost
of
any
return
on
its
investment
that
might
well
lose
its
entire
investment
through
his
forfeiture.
well,
there
are
no
rule
require
to
buyer
to
buy.
the
buyer
would
have
unconscionable
bargaining
advantage
and
substantial
control
of
the
interstate's
supply
as
seller
would
be
forced
to
take
whatever
rate
the
pipeline
offered
while
the
buyer
at
its
selection
could
cause
a
considerable
amount
of
gas
supplied
to
be
forever
lost
in
intrastate
market.
this
court
should
not
condone
a
rule
which
will
cause
such
an
equities
between
the
parties
and
such
control
over
gas
supply.
in
the
absence
of
a
requirement
on
the
part
of
a
pipe
line
to
continue
taking
gas
deliveries
neither
the
right
to
seek
abandonment
which
might
or
might
not
be
granted
and
which
would
be
a
remedy
to
a
producer
only
if
there's
a
satisfactory
ultimate
market
nor
the
right
deal
out
of
a
file
or
rate
increase
afford
the
producer
in
a
dependable
solution
to
its
needs
or
even
the
needs
of
the
ultimate
consumer
who
depends
upon
these
committee
gas
supplies.
in
rulemaking
section
7
(b),
the
abandonment
section
applicable
to
purchasers
of
pipelines
however
does
not
leave
the
pipe
line
without
an
adequate
meaningful
remedy.
if
it
is
the
unilateral
rate
to
which
the
pipe
line
objects,
the
pipeline
is
protected
under
the
rate
review
functions
of
the
commission
under
sections
4
and
5
of
the
act
and
under
the
usual
escalation
clauses
in
the
pipe
line
sales
contract.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
i
believe
(inaudible)
has
pretty
well
answered
that
question
that
if
there
is
a
contractual
impediment
there
may
be
no
unilateral
rate
increase.
memphis
on
the
other
hand
says
that
if
there
is
no
contractual
impediment.
there
may
be
a
unilateral
on
its
face
as
just
as
unreasonable
is
that
the
rate
increase
that
left
up
to
decision
of
the
commission.
sierra
says
that
if
the
rate
increase
is
necessary
to
prevent
confiscation
maybe
of
the
pipeline
that
under
that
circumstance
there
may
be
an
increase
but
he
say
that
it's
matter
just
loosing
money
on
an
improvident
contract
that
they
will
--
that
abrogate
the
contracts.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
thank
you,
your
honor.
one
more
moment,
if
the
pipe
line
does
not
want
to
take
the
gas
at
any
price
for
some
peculiar
reason
the
pipe
line
may
seek
abandonment
which
is
granted
but
always
provide
a
meaningful
remedy
to
the
pipe
line.
with
it
simplest
terms
is
either
the
buyer
or
the
seller
is
to
be
bound
by
section
7
(b)
then
the
rule
of
fair
play
requires
it
both
be
bound.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
yes,
your
honor,
that
permits
to
recover
by
the
pipe
line
if
the
commission
finds
the
rate
was
too
high
that
the
increase
shouldn't
have
been
permitted,
we
have
to
refund
all
the
increase
and
interest
of
7%.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
well,
your
honor
of
course
in
initiating
the
purchase,
the
pipe
line
displayed
the
bargain
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
well,
there's
a
guideline
rate
in
south
louisiana
area
rate
has
not
yet
been
established.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
continental's
new
rate
is
that
the
guideline
rate
for
all
gas
or
for
increase
price,
yes.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
fifteen
and
three
quarter
cents
including
tax
reimbursement.
it's
actually
14
cents
net
to
the
producers.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
greater.
almost
certainly
would
be
greater.
i
don't
believe
that
united
would
contend
that
they
could
buy
gas
on
their
new
contract
in
south
louisiana
for
15
and
3
quarter
cents.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
even
--
well,
i
don't
think
they
could
buy
it
at
their
contract
rate
most.
no,
sir.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
or
on
question
they
could
buy
a
gas
at
21
and
a
quarter
cents
in
south
louisiana
which
is
the
guideline
rate
for
new
gas.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
black,
they're
not
objecting
to
the
level
of
contracts
unilateral
rate.
they
didn't
raise
that
issue,
they
didn't
attack
the
level
of
the
rate
at
all,
they're
only
attacking
our
right
to
file
the
unilateral
rate
and
require
them
to
continue
taking
at
all.
they
say
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
if
that
is
the
case
mr.
justice
white,
they
should've
availed
themselves
and
the
remedy
of
seeking
abandonment.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
well,
there
are
some
evidence
in
the
record
by
their
vice
president
that
they
were
into
take
to
pay
position
and
that
they
didn't
need
that
chaos
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
they
were
perfectly
happy
to
take
it
at
10
cents
but
they
just
were
didn't
want
to
take
it
at
any
higher
price.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
the
commission
accepted
our
rate
filing
without
suspension
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
--
over
the
protest
of
united.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
there
is
--
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
there
are
two
different
controversies
here.
one,
is
the
jurisdiction
reached
or
the
commission
or
is
it
going
to
be
the
pipe
line
or
the
commission
who
is
going
to
decide
whether
gas
which
is
being
committed
to
the
interstate
market
and
which
is
being
used
in
support
of
the
certification
of
pipe
line
facilities
is
going
to
be
removed
from
the
interstate
market
at
election
of
pipeline
recollection
of
the
commission.
that's
the
jurisdiction
taken.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
stays
to
it,
yes
sir.
that's
between
private
parties
i
think,
it's
a
question
of
bargaining
equality.
mr.
bruce
r.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it

the
court.
the
