unknown
speaker
oh,
i
gather
national
--
natural
gas
companies
including
pipe
line
purchasing,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
the
language
of
7
(b),
every
natural
gas
company
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
and
that
--
doesn't
that
include
pipe
lines,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
it
will
abandon
all
or
any
course
of
its
facilities
so
fort
without
the
approval.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
involves
--
isn't
that
the
core
of
the
case,
its
to
what
the
scope
of
that
(inaudible)
requirement?
unknown
speaker
and
you
--
that's
fine
i
guess,
i'll
summarize
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
have
the
duty
that
--
you
have
the
duty,
do
you
not,
that
in
that
argument,
you
have
the
duty
to
continue
those
(inaudible)
the
operation
of
this,
or
isn't
he
--
continue
that
--
unknown
speaker
permission
to
abandon
and
the
question
is
whether
that
comprehends
this
abandonment
in
the
sense
that
if
you
don't
have
those
authorities
physically
there
although
not
utilize
to
purchase
gas
in
this
custom.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
--
that's
the
core
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
is
a
kind
of
a
collateral
issue
here,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
not
be
essential
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
--
mr.
woods,
wasn't
the
argument
made
in
sunray
by
the
producer
there
that
what
not
make
and
continue
supplying
gas
if
united
didn't
have
to
take
it
and
i
think
this
language
as
well,
united
has
its
obligation
too.
would
that
mean
you
suppose
--
unknown
speaker
you
mean
at
their
request?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
why
i
used
those
except
in
the
context
of
the
case
but
at
least
what
follows
after
that
about
united
having
its
obligation
it
says,
some
significance
too
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i'm
sure
you
do.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sure
you
do.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
did
the
commission
say
that
it
has
the
power
to
force
the
purchaser
to
continue
even
if
there
isn't
an
abandonment
of
facilities?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
only
physical?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
is
on
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
oh,
(inaudible)
gas
on
the
contract,
continuing
the
same
type
of
business?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
--
that
wouldn't
justify
the
commission
to
say,
since
you've
been
buying
gas
in
(inaudible)
--
since
you've
been
doing
that
we've
permitted
you
to
do
it,
you
can
abandon
(inaudible)
--
you
think
the
commission
has
no
power
of
this
kind
under
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
you've
been
selling
--
you've
been
buying
gas
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
you
wanted
change
it
and
buy
it
and
get
to
pay
more?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible),
do
you
think
it
could
make
(inaudible)
to
require
you
to
continue
to
operate
under
those
terms?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
limited
meaning
of
the
word
facility?
unknown
speaker
you
may
be
right
now
with
the
statute
figuratively
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
woods,
could
this
problem
arise
in
connection
with
your
sales,
united
sales
to
your
customers?
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
a
price
disagreement
with
one
of
your
customers?
unknown
speaker
that
--
i
know.
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
again?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
it
can
precipitate
--
at
least
can
be
assured
that
the
commission
thinks
the
rates
are
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
but
we've
got
away
from
that?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
made
some
departures
from
that
basis
of
rate
making
in
this
gas
area,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
so,
its
still
so
--
is
it
still
at
the
seller's
cost?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
in
the
--
it
is
in
the
area
--
unknown
speaker
with
all
of
the
sellers,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you'd
be
making
this
argument,
would
you
mr.
woods
if
your
only
source
of
supply
was
continental
and
therefore
the
supply
that
you'd
have
available
for
your
costumers,
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
which
would
mean
there
that
--
to
that
extent
the
dedication
of
that
gas
necessarily
your
costumers
is
quite
meaningless,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you're
the
only
supplier
of
your
costumer
and
you're
only
source
to
survive,
i
suppose
it
doesn't
(inaudible)
but
that's
the
extreme
to
which
you'd
carry
your
argument,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
have
the
other
side
of
the
coin
--
suppose
instead
of
the
producer
rating,
the
price
to
you
at
the
end
of
the
period,
the
contract
period,
suppose
you
said
to
them,
now,
in
the
future,
we're
only
going
to
pay
you
20%
less.
and
we've
been
paying
that
in
the
past.
would
they
have
any
jurisdiction
over
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
as
to
what?
unknown
speaker
continental
--
if
the
contract
is
terminated
for
one
reason
or
another
and
you're
negotiating
and
you
just
to
say
to
this
people
perhaps
have
no
other
outlet
for
their
gas,
don't
you
say
you'll
now
in
the
future
we're
going
to
pay
you
20%
less
and
there's
no
more.
and
they
couldn't
do
it
profitably,
would
the
commission
have
any
jurisdiction
over
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see
but
i
suppose
we
have
to
have
a
rule
that
would
encompass
a
situation
by
the
word
no
other
pipe
lines
to
take
the
gas,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
i
think
there
has
been
--
they
wouldn't
contemplate
at
all
and
decide
it.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
they
gave
no
consideration
to
it
or
that
they
thought
this
would
cover
it?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
gather
national

gas
companies
