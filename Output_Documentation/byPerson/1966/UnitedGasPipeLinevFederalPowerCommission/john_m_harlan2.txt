attached
terms
and
conditions
to
your
certificate
to
require
you
to
maintain
facilities
and
keep
a
flow
of
oil
through
the
line
for
a
stated
period
or
indicment
or
until
further
order
of
the
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what's
contrary
to
that
again?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
say,
you
go
and
then
you
apply
for
a
certificate
to
construct
and
operate
pipe
line,
let's
say.
what's
contrary
to
that?
then
the
commission
saying
to
you,
alright,
we're
giving
this
provided
that
you
maintain
a
flow
of
product
through
this
pipe
line
for
the
next
50
years?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
so
the
act
looks
to
me
as
if
there's
no
limitation
on
the
terms
and
the
conditions
that
the
commission
could
attach
except
the
standard
on
the
convenience
to
necessitate
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
constitution
may
provide.
the
--
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
the
certificate
here
containing
the
no
provisions
of
that
sort
whatever,
no
provisions
subjecting
you
to
--
the
further
order
of
the
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

subjected
to
the
commission's
rules
and
regulations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
anything
in
the
commission's
rules
and
regulations
are
relevant
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
say
is,
anything
that's
pertinent
to
this
particular
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they're
not
sales,
does
it?
that
you've
got
to
be
ready
and
willing
to
--
can
file
permissions?
to
do
the
acts
and
the
performance
or
service
proposed
in
the
confirmed
provisions
of
the
act
in
the
requirements
rules
and
regulations
in
question
so
you
don't
have
to
go
around
and
buying
things,
do
you?
justice
john
m.

it
may
be
an
issue
not
an
