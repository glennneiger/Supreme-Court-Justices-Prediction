mr.
jusctice
black
may
i
ask
you
when
you
say
abandonment,
abandonment
of
what?
mr.
jusctice
black
what
are
those
facilities?
mr.
jusctice
black
is
it
the
equipment,
is
it
the
equipment
they
are
about
to
abandon?
mr.
jusctice
black
or
is
it
a
contract?
mr.
jusctice
black
suppose
they
had
bought
gas
from
somebody
else,
would
you
abandon
this
(inaudible)?
mr.
jusctice
black
suppose
this
company
had
bought
gas
from
someone
else
and
not
abandon
its
equipment
continued
to
supply.
mr.
jusctice
black
the
same
reserves
but
suppose
they
had
substituted
something
else
exactly
like
it
and
get
it?
mr.
jusctice
black
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this,
as
i
gather
this
controversy,
they
say
that
you
have
taken
provision
which
allows
you
to
prevent
the
abandonment
of
equipment
and
facilities
whatever
they
are
and
you
have
stretched
that
thereby
you
move
beyond
that
and
tell
them
that
they've
got
to
submit
to
the
commission
any
application
to
change
the
gas
they're
using
in
any
equipments,
is
that
the
controversy?
mr.
jusctice
black
am
i
right
about
their
contention?
mr.
jusctice
black
even
if
there
is
an
abandonment
they
say
you
can't
reach
that
contract.
mr.
jusctice
black
you
can't
say
--
i
must
say
to
pay
for
their
gas
from
whom
they
have
purchased
on
the
ground
that
they
are
abandoning
their
plant.
they
said
the
two
are
entirely
separate
and
distinct.
mr.
jusctice
black
but
can
he?
mr.
jusctice
black
all
the
elements
of
the
purchase
that
they
make?
mr.
jusctice
black
or
they
have
(inaudible)
they
make?
mr.
jusctice
black
but
they
want
to
abandon?
mr.
jusctice
black
how
much
high?
how
much
higher?
mr.
jusctice
black
but
why
are
they
objecting
to
your
contract(voice
overlap)?
mr.
jusctice
black
what
is
the
real
controversy?
you
don't
find
things
on
the
(inaudible).
mr.
jusctice
black
what
does
united
want
to
do?
and
what
are
the
other
company
want,
to
do?
what's
going
to
be
the
result
on
gas
prices?
mr.
jusctice
black
or
whether
it's
committed
there
and
the
commission
got
a
right
to
see
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jusctice
black
why
do
you
buy
a
cheaper
for
intrastate
users?
mr.
jusctice
black
yes.
mr.
jusctice
black
does
that
sound
like
maybe
the
commission
has
not
been
(inaudible)?
mr.
jusctice
black
that's
a
going
rate?
mr.
jusctice
black
that
of
course
if
you
paid
more
part
than
you
should
that
wouldn't
look
at
for
the
public,
wouldn't
it?
mr.
jusctice
black
you
still
hadn't
got
enough
to
the
fpc's
price?
mr.
jusctice
black
how
is
it?
mr.
jusctice
black
how
is
it?
mr.
jusctice

21
of
