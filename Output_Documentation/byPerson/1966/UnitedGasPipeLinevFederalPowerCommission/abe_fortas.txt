justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
they
--
excuse
me
sir.
there
are
area
rate
proceedings
affecting
this
field?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
those
area
of
rate
proceedings
aren't
completed,
what
sort
of
order
will
be
entered?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
determination
as
to
whether
that
will
apply
to
existing
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
does
con
--
did
continental's
stipulation
that
which
just
referred
mean
anything
more
than
that,
the
area
rate
price
one
promulgated
by
the
commission
would
apply
to
this
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
was
that
an
issue
of
contention?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
but
if
the
federal
trade
commission
is
doing
the
supervene
prize
anyway?
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
your
contract
to
--
about
that
or
accepted
as
by
a
reason
of
the
operational
fpc's
order?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
we'll
find
out.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
a
--
that's
the
hardship
of
you're
having
to
abide
by
the
area
price.
what
i'm
asking
you
is
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
whether
you
agreed
to
abide
by
the
area
prices
continental
was
demanding?
justice
abe
fortas
or
whether
you
have
to
abide
by
the
area
price
as
a
result
of
the
fpc
order?
justice
abe
fortas
the
maximum?
justice
abe
fortas
there
won't
be
a
fixed
price?
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
well,
either
i
misunderstood
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
misunderstood
you,
i'm
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
do
with
section
5
(a)
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
it
doesn't.
it
says
that
the
commission
may
after
a
hearing
on
its
own
motion,
couldn't
it
or
upon
a
complaint?
justice
abe
fortas
it
may
do
it
either
way?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right
because
that
seems
to
provide
that
the
commission
has
very
broad
rate
making
power.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm?
what
i
want
to
get
at
is
whether
your
point
is
that
the
commission
did
not
have
power
to
fix
the
rate
here
or
that
it
fix
the
rate
pursuant
to
an
incorrect
standard
that's
what
i
like
to
know.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
true.
now,
how
do?
i
mean,
but
that
is
what
the
commission
did
here
in
effect,
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
then
the
commission
issued
some
sort
of
order,
didn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
sorry.
as
i
understand
the
solicitors
general's
brief,
he
places
a
good
deal
of
reliance
on
the
powers
of
section
5,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
continental
doesn't
sell
this
gas
to
you,
what
can
you
do
with
it?
justice
abe
fortas
a
what?
justice
abe
fortas
abandon
what?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
if
they
don't
sell
the
gas
to
you,
what
could
they
do
with
it?
justice
abe
fortas
anybody
else
down
there
with
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
why
--
they
--
are
they
a
competitor
for
this
but
they
didn't
wan
it?
justice
abe
fortas
neither
you
nor
the
seller
company
want
to
take
the
gas,
what
happens
to
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happens
to
the
gas?
the
gas
remains
in
the
ground,
was
it
distributed
--
does
it
move
into
another
field,
so
what
happens
to
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
may
be
siphoned
off
or
whatever
the
proper
phrase
is
by
--
under
wells
or
the
fields,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
is
important,
if
continental
is
selling
this
gas
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
and
sell
to
you
unless
than
its
--
commission
approved
prices?
justice
abe
fortas
continental
has
filed
a
posted
prices
with
the
commission,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
been
approved
by
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
accepted
by
the
commission.
if
continental
sell
to
you
is
less
than,
would
that
break
the
law?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
can
they
sell
that
without
violating
the
law?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
commission
anywhere
in
its
rules
or
anywhere
else
advised
pipe
lines
that
if
they
enter
into
a
contract
to
take
natural
gas
and
they
come
to
the
commission
and
get
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
that
the
contract
term
does
not
mean
what
an
ordinarily
means
that's
really
the
position
here,
isn't
it?
that
is
to
say
if
the
commission
basic
position
here
it
seems
to
me
is
that
the
pipe
line
makes
a
contract
with
a
producer
that
the
term
limitation,
the
limitation
of
the
contract
as
to
time
is
subject
to
nullification
by
the
commission
or
to
quite
add
more
accurately
that
the
contract
continues
indefinitely
regardless
of
the
terms
classified
therein
unless
the
commission
otherwise
permits
by
order,
is
that
what
this
is
about?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
schiff,
why
didn't
the
commission
--
let
me
ask
you
of
the
question
this
way,
where
the
additional
cost
or
had
there
been
an
increase
in
the
cost
to
the
producer
of
the
gas
that
it
produce
to
the
point
of
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
why
didn't
the
commission
say,
all
right,
the
pipelines
got
to
continue
but
it
will
continue
under
the
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
the
question
is
whether
the
contract
is
over
or
whether
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
to
extend
the
contract
or
to
write
a
new
contract
for
the
five
years,
it's
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
would
you
tell
me
really
will
that
be
a
waste
of
gas
in
all
probability,
will
they
not
if
depending
upon
whether
this
management
require
to
take
this
gas?
justice
abe
fortas
can
they
make
a
finding
here?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
way
for
--
to
supersede
the
price
provision
of
the
contract
during
the
contract's
term
in
your
judgment?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
there
has
been
a
small
amount
of
controversy
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
is
quite,
is
it
what
the
commission
is
saying
is
that
if
this
is
an
impossible
situation
to
come
before
abandonment
proceeding
and
maybe
they
will
do
the
wrong
thing
over
abandonment
proceeding
but
that's
what
they
are
saying.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
they're
saying
in
what
you're
doing
is
short
circuiting
the
administrative
process
and
you
may
have
a
complaint
after
abandonment
proceeding
but
you
ought
not
to
be
heard
prior
to
abandonment
proceeding
and
that
to
my
mind
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
commission
is
right
in
saying
that
you
got
to
come
in
for
an
abandonment
proceeding
and
that
before
you'd
be
heard
to
attack
this
commission.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
they

excuse
me
sir.
there
are
area
rate
proceedings
