j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
one
of
the
contracts
run
out
and
you
had
the
same
--
they
didn't
want
to
pay
as
much
as
you've
been
charging,
they
want
to
look
up
a
smaller
price
and
you
refused
to
supply
them
at
the
price
that
which
they
wanted
to
buy.
would
sunray
force
you
to
continue
supplying
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
the
continental
wouldn't
make
a
--
whether
this
can
be
done
in
contract
in
some
(inaudible)
and
to
get
that
gas
to
consumer
that
would
require
the
use
of
united
pipelines
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
commission
could
not
force
united
to
carry
for
that
consumer
with
only
continental
had
a
contract,
it
couldn't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
merrill,
may
i
ask
you?
mr.
merrill,
you
suggested
that
the
pipe
line
company
is
not
without
remedy
because
of
the
powers
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
some
of
the
rate
under
section
4
or
5
on
the
unilateral
filing
by
the
producer.
now
let's
see,
how
does
that
work
if
let's
say
unilateral
filing
by
the
producer
and
the
rates
are
suspended
under
4
and
then
ultimately
there's
a
determination
of
the
rates
too
high,
does
that
permit
they
were
companied
by
the
pipeline?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
fifteen
or
some
cents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
just
want
to
--
when
you
filed
your
15
cents
of
rate,
goes
no
suspension
proceeding
in
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
fixed
unilaterally
by
the
seller?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
would
ultimately
the
commission
can
determine
that
the
prices
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
initially?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
can't
get
away
with
it
if
the
commission
thinks
it's
too
high.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
continental's
needs,
i
still
insist
that
of
course
i
dissented
on
this
whole
area
of
business
you
may
call
but
nevertheless
i
thought
that
introduce
the
new
concept
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

in
that
seal
you
can
get
a
cheaper?
