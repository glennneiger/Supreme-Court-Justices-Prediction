mr.
vernon
w.
woods
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
united
gas
pipe
line
company
is
a
natural
gas
company
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
purchasing
gas
from
producers
in
the
field,
transporting
that
gas
through
pipe
lines
and
then
selling
it
to
distributors
for
resale
and
to
industry
directly
for
there
own
use.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
it
grows
out
of
an
order
issued
by
the
federal
power
commission.
that
order
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
natural
gas
act
in
this
38
and
this
is
an
act
of
1938.
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
act,
the
federal
power
commission
has
assumed
they
had
power
to
order
a
pipe
line
to
purchase
gas.
moreover,
to
pay
a
price
fixed
unilaterally
by
the
seller
and
finally
to
purchase
quantities
in
volumes
consistent
with
the
cancelled
contract.
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
posed
two
questions,
whether
the
federal
power
commission
in
fact
had
a
power,
authority
to
order
a
pipe
line
without
its
consent
to
continue
purchasing
gas
after
the
producer
had
cancelled
the
contract
in
which
a
pipe
line
had
been
buying
gas
whether
it
had
authority
to
order
the
pipe
line
to
pay
the
unilaterally
increased
price
fixed
by
the
seller
for
that
gas.
the
second
question
being
that
if
the
act
have
--
that
in
it
which
permits
the
commission
to
issue
such
an
order
then
is
the
act
to
that
extent
unconstitutional
as
violative
for
the
due
process
requirements
just
compensation
required
by
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
facts
are
undisputed
and
can
be
stated
briefly
and
they're
important
to
this
petition
to
show
the
problem
that
it
is
faced
with
by
the
commission's
order.
in
january
1953,
united
and
continental
oil
company
entered
into
a
contract
under
the
terms
in
which
continental
agreed
to
sell
and
united
agreed
to
buy
gas
produced
by
continental
oil
company
in
the
junction
bayou
field.
the
junction
bayou
field
is
located
in
cameron
parish
which
is
right
in
the
southwest
corner
of
louisiana
next
to
the
texas
boundary
or
border.
a
contract
of
a
ten
year
primary
term
with
the
provision
that
it
would
automatically
continue
in
effect
after
expiration
of
the
primary
term
provided
that
either
party
could
cancel
the
contract
upon
90
days
prior
written
notice.
the
contract
also
provided
fixed
prices
to
be
paid
for
the
gas.
two
prices,
the
one
in
effect
at
the
end
of
the
primary
term.
that
is
the
second
5
year
period
of
the
contract
was
10.79
cents
per
mcf
inclusive
of
tax
reimbursement.
in
other
words,
united
gas
line
company
was
paying
continental
10.79
cents
per
mcf
as
the
contract
was
nearing
the
end
of
its
primary
term.
now,
this
contract
would've
continued
automatically
in
effect.
but
for
the
fact,
the
continental
oil
company
some
90
days
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
primary
term
wrote
to
united
and
said,
we
cancel
the
contract.
and
united
accepted
the
letter.
it
was
canceled
on
the
terms
of
the
contract.
thereafter
united
rather
continental
came
to
united
and
said,
we'd
like
to
negotiate
with
you.
we'd
like
to
enter
to
a
new
contract
covering
the
injunction,
bayou
field
gas.
and
it
is
,fine,
let's
talk
about
it.
continental
said
in
substance
that
we
want
to
increase
the
price
by
our
standards,
united
standards
substantially.
they
ordered
the
price
to
go
up
to
approximately
18
cents
in
mcf.
that
is
over
the
whole
term
of
the
contract.
they
would've
started
a
little
less
than
that
about
15.75.
but
they
had
something
else
in
there
that
was
completely
unacceptable
to
united.
they
said
that,
we
wanted
to
remain
open-ended.
with
the
idea
in
mind
that
you
will
agree
contractually
that
if
the
federal
power
commission
will
permit
a
higher
price
or
different
--
a
higher
price
and
that
to
which
we've
agreed
contractually
in
the
so-called
area
rate
proceeding,
that
we
may
charge
that
rate
and
you
must
pay
it.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
there
are
area
rate
proceeding,
yes
sir,
affecting
south
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
as
i
appreciated
the
federal
power
commission
contemplates
that
it
would
enter
an
order
stating
that
all
gas
sold
in
south
louisiana
will
be
sold
at
a
specific
price,
18.50
cents,
that
is
as
an
initial
rate.
i
think
that
they
probably
contemplate
that
gas
which
is
defined
as
all
gas
would
be
sold
at
a
lesser
rate.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
yes.
i
think
it
will
apply
to
existing
contracts
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that's
exactly
what
it
does
mean
sir.
that
means
at
the
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
because
of
this,
we
wished
to
had
the
--
we
wished
to
have
a
prize
that
was
fixed.
it's
very
well
possible.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
it
makes
a
very
great
deal
of
difference
to
us,
sir
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
--
in
this
sense.
yes,
but
it
makes
a
difference
in
this
sense.
that
we
sell
gas
in
turn
and
here
is
really
the
crux
of
this
problem.
we
sell
gas
in
turn
and
we
sell
it
the
only
way
we
can
sell
it
under
the
act
and
that's
a
contraction
to
fixed
rates.
the
federal
power
commission
can't
come
along
and
increase
of
those
rates.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
let
me
say
this,
we
do
not
have
to
abide
by
the
area
price
if
we
agreed
to
a
lower
price.
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
in
other
words
if
we
contractually
agree,
continental
and
united,
this
gas
will
sell
for
15
cents
in
mcf
and
the
area
price
eventually
comes
out
and
says
that
the
maximum
allowable
price
is
18
cents.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
that's
what
it
would
be.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
won't
be
appraised
that
every
bit
of
gas
has
got
to
be
sold
that's
if
there
are
lesser
contract
prizes
then
as
i
appreciate
the
area
price
it
doesn't
--
published
by
the
federal
power
commission.
they
will
not
supersede
those
lesser
prices.
it
will
not
make
unlawful
continental's
agreement
to
sell
us
gas
at
15
cents
simply
because
the
federal
power
commission
said
the
gas,
the
maximum
price
it
can
be
charged
is
18
cents.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
did
not
make
it
clear
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
apologize
for
not
having
made
it
clear.
in
any
event
these
negotiations
proceeded
on
this
basis.
united
said
we're
willing
to
buy
your
gas
but
we
want
to
charge,
we
won't
--
we're
going
to
pay
a
specific
prize.
it
was
the
price
that
we
would
then
pay.
there
were
circumstances
as
we
thought,
that
was
the
appropriate
level.
continental
said,
we
don't
agree
with
that.
any
event
the
parties
could
not
get
together.
at
that
point
continental
went
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
filed
its
rate
that
it
asked
us
for
unilaterally
with
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
federal
power
commission
accepted
it
and
made
it
effective.
now,
there
are
these
other
aspects
of
the
case
that
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
of.
first
of
all
when
continental
undertook
to
sell
us
his
gas,
actually
the
philips
case,
it
came
to
the
federal
power
commission
to
obtain
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
authorizing
it
to
sell
the
gas
to
united.
united
also
when
it
undertook
to
buy
this
gas
out
at
the
injunction
bayou
field
it
had
an
existence,
a
pipeline,
it
ran
from
the
southwest
corner
of
louisiana
over
into
texas
and
this
gas
is
located
close
to
that
pipeline.
we
had
to
build
certain
minimal
facilities
to
receive
this
gas
into
our
system.
meter
station
and
tubing
that
came
into
our
line
and
we
asked
the
federal
power
commission
for
a
certificate
authorizing
us
to
construct
and
operate
those
facilities.
we
also
received
an
authorization
to
move
this
gas
and
to
transport
in
into
state
commerce.
now,
at
the
time
the
federal
power
commission
accepted
the
increase
rate
filed
unilaterally
by
continental
which
was
the
rate
they
demanded
of
us
and
which
weren't
willing
to
read
to
contractually.
the
commission
advised
upon
continental's
request
that
it
would
be
come
effective
at
the
end
of
the
primary
term
of
the
contract
which
was
january
31,
1963,
the
date
that
continental
had
made
its
cancellation
effective.
united
did
not
then
accept
any
gas
from
continental
after
that
date.
it
did
not
do
so
because
it
did
not
wish
to
pay
that
price
for
the
gas
and
because
he
believed
that
the
bargaining
processes
were
left
intact.
if
he
weren't
forced
to
buy
this
gas,
that
they
could
bargain
with
continental
and
then
forget
the
gas
in
his
judgment
and
price
it
though
as
appropriate
and
proper
for
sale
in
the
beaumont
area
where
this
gas
in
actually
transported.
now
in
that
connection,
united
sells
gas
in
the
southeast
part
of
texas
around
beaumont
where
it
takes
this
gas.
its
sells
are
not
only
to
city
gates,
that
is
to
distributors
for
resale
in
the
city
of
beaumont
but
it
sells
a
very
great
quantities
of
gas
directly
to
industries
and
on
the
only
and
the
only
way
you
can
sell
it
of
course
is
by
contract
and
it
sells
there
at
contractually
fixed
rates.
now
in
addition
to
that
fact
united
is
faced
in
this
area
as
it
is
in
the
whole
of
south
texas
and
south
louisiana,
the
very
active
and
very
strenuous
competition
for
its
markets
is
faced
with
competition
by
intrastate
suppliers
who
are
willing
to
sell
their
gas
directly
to
industries
or
to
town
borders
often
times
at
prices
cheaper
than
the
federal
power
commission
had
itself
reflected
in
its
approval
of
rates
and
so
fort
filed
by
independent
producers
such
as
continental.
so
united
is
--
the
point
is
that
we
are
faced
there
with
very
active
competition,
the
federal
power
commission
has
itself
ruled
in
a
case
involving
united
that
it
cannot
protect
united
selling
gas
to
even
a
city
gate,
that
that
is
a
distributor
for
resale
from
intrastate
competition.
it
said
to
united
that
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction
extends
only
to
interstate
commerce.
if
there's
intrastate
commerce
that
you
must
compete
with
then
you
must
take
care
of
yourself.
now
the
point
of
it
is
that
in
the
structure
of
the
act,
united
gas
pipe
line
company
as
a
pipe
line
sells
gas
by
contract.
that's
the
only
way
it
can
sell
gas.
it
has
to
compete
with
other
suppliers
and
it
has
to
compete
with
other
fuels
and
it
has
to
sell
gas
to
industries
for
example
on
the
basis
of
contractually
fixed
rates.
now
that
is
the
way
the
act
is
designed
and
that's
the
scheme
of
the
act.
and
in
order
to
do
that
united
must
determine
what
it
can
afford
to
pay
for
gas.
it's
not
here
so
much
concern
with
the
fact
that
the
federal
power
commission
may
view
continental
15.75
cents
which
it
filled
as
fair
and
reasonable
from
continental's
point
of
view.
that
is
not
our
concern.
our
concern
is
that
we
must
buy
gas
that
we
can
sell
in
competition
in
southwest
texas
and
still
make
a
profit
and
we
must
buy
gas
at
a
price
that
we
can
sell
under
contractually
fixed
rate
and
still
make
a
profit
and
that
we
under
the
act
are
the
only
one
that
determine
that
fact.
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
do
it.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well
let's
see,
section
5
(a)
provides
that
the
commission
may
up
on
motion
institute
a
proceeding
to
determine
a
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rate
of
any
natural
gas
company
subject
to
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
upon
a
complaint.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
that's
correct
sir,
either
a
complaint
upon
its
own
motion.
how
do
i
reconcile
that
and
how
do
that
fit
into
this
problem
here?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
it
has
broad
rate
making
powers
on
this
sense
sir.
that
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
inquiring
in
this
case
into
the
rate
that
continental
is
charging
for
this
gas
and
the
question
that
it
would
seek
to
determine
there
is
whether
continental's
rate
is
just
and
reasonable
measured
by
what
test
measured
by
the
financial
requirements
of
continental
that
is
the
producer's
requirements.
it's
measuring
it
by
the
sellers'
requirements
as
distinguish
from
the
buyers'
requirements.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
well
to
begin
it
the
commission
has
no
power
to
fix
any
rate,
the
commission
cannot
make
rates.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that's
the
law
sir,
i
think.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
actually
what
had
actually
happened
here
was
that
continental
unilaterally
decided
on
the
rate
it
would
charge
entirely.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
the
commission
had
issued
some
orders
in
a
so-called
policy
statement
in
a
docket
61-1
which
said
this,
that
these
are
guideline
rates.
and
you're
right
sir,
they
were
certain
rates
that
had
been
fixed
and
they
were
to
be
employed
by
the
commission
not
as
the
rate
that
would
be
charged
necessarily
by
the
any
particular
producer
but
as
the
basis
on
which
they
would
either
suspend
an
act.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
not
on
section
5,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no,
i
didn't
understand
that
he
was
--
he
placed
on
reliance
as
i
appreciate
it
on
the
fact
that
15.75
cents
have
been
fixed
by
the
commission
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
--
as
a
guideline
rate.
united
thinks
that
the
commission
was
never
intended
that
the
natural
gas
act
to
have
power
to
do
what
its
done
in
this
order
that
is
to
order
the
purchasing
of
gas
are
the
acceptance
of
a
rate
filed
unilaterally
by
the
seller.
now
we
think
that's
true
for
basically
for
the
reasons.
first
of
all
the
act
very
clearly
does
not
include
and
encompass
and
bring
within
the
commission's
jurisdiction
that
purchasing
of
gas.
secondly,
the
act
quite
clearly
provides
that
act
--
that
rates
had
to
be
fixed
by
a
contract.
that
is
that
the
commission
itself
does
not
fix
rates.
that
natural
gas
companies
fix
rates
and
file
them
and
they're
reviewed
by
the
commission.
and
that
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
do
what
is
done
here
and
that
is
to
force
the
natural
gas
company
to
accept
any
rate.
that
unless
a
consent
is
given
first
to
the
natural
gas
company
to
accept
the
rate
which
it
can
be
reviewed
by
commission
that
the
commission
itself
have
no
authority
to
supply
that
agreement
to
a
rate.
thirdly,
we
think
under
the
scheme
of
the
act,
the
detrimental
effects
have
opened
this
to
united
gas
pipe
line
company
illustrate
that
the
act
was
never
intended
to
place
a
company
in
a
position
were
it
had
to
buy
gas
or
had
to
pay
a
particular
rate.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
company
itself
sells
the
gas
under
contraction
arrangements
and
it
is
only
under
those
circumstances
that
he
can
sell
gas
and
that
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
increase
his
own
sales
rate
that
is
the
company's
sales
rates
in
order
to
recover
to
that
company.
the
increase
calls
to
--
are
forced
upon
it
by
unilaterally
increased
rates
by
the
seller.
now,
let
me
fix
the
first
proposition
and
that
is
that
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
include
the
purchasing
of
gas.
the
scope
of
the
natural
gas
act
is
defined
by
section
1
(b)
of
the
act.
and
section
1
(b)
says
that
the
act
extends
to
the
transportation
and
sale
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
the
companies
engage
in
such
transportation
and
sales.
for
emphasis
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
point
out
that
the
government
here
concedes
that
section
1
(b)
does
not
include
purchasing.
page
5
of
its
brief
in
opposition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
the
government
says,
although
section
1
(b)
does
not
explicitly
bring
within
the
commission's
regulatory
power
the
purchase
of
natural
gas,
it
does
give
the
commission
authority
over
the
transportation
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
the
government
has
conceded
what
is
obvious
and
that
is
that
this
act
was
not
designed
to
regulate
the
purchasing
or
the
procurement
of
natural
gas.
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
establishes
that
congress
adopted
an
act
that
it
knew
did
not
include
or
extend
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
the
purchasing
or
procurement
of
natural
gas.
this
is
true
because
in
january
--
in
july
1937
at
the
time
the
natural
gas
act
was
being
considered
by
congress
there
was
--
it
introduced
into
congress
a
bill
in
both
houses,
it's
in
the
bill
1717
or
1919
which
would
have
given
the
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
procurement
or
purchasing
of
natural
gas
by
pipe
lines.
now,
that
bill
was
not
adopted
that
is
itself
clearly
reflects
the
fact
that
congress
rejected
the
type
of
thing
that
the
commission
is
undertaking
here
to
say
is
true.
congress
did
not
intend
to
give
the
commission
power
to
make
a
common
purchase
so
to
speak
out
of
a
pipe
line,
are
to
require
to
purchase
gas
other
than
on
a
contractual
basis
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
with
the
wording
of
section
1
(b)
of
the
act
which
does
not
include
purchasing.
those
sections
of
the
act
on
which
commission
here
relies,
the
certificate
section
of
the
act
does
not
authorize
the
commission
to
issue
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
purchase
gas.
the
commission
has
never
issued
such
a
certificate.
consistent
therewith
section
7
(b)
which
is
the
abandonment
section
of
the
act
does
not
authorize
the
commission
to
issue
an
abandonment
to
stop
purchasing
gas.
the
word
purchasing
doesn't
appear
in
either
of
those
two
sections
at
all.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
the
language
of
7
(b),
it
applies
to
all
natural
gas
companies,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
applies
to
a
pipe
line
company.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
says
no
natural
gas
company,
is
that
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
the
commission
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
i
very
much
think
i
should.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
to
begin
with,
you're
right.
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
it
has
the
power
to
order
the
purchasing
of
gas
and
the
payment
of
this
unilaterally
increased
priced
because
it
has
authority
to
authorize
the
abandonment
of
facilities
and
it
said
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
permission
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does
comprehend
that
and
we've
so
argued
it
the
commission.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
think
that's
a
large
part
of
it
and
i
think
the
rest
of
the
act
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
no,
i
think
it
all
ties
together
your
honor.
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
the
act
doesn't
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
doesn't
permit
the
commission
to
do
what
it's
undertaken
to
do.
the
commission
has
--
to
get
to
the
point
that's
raise
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
taken
the
position
that
united
here
has
a
duty
to
continue
purchasing
gas
and
therefore
to
operate
these
facilities
and
that
unless
it
does
so
its
abandon
facilities
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
now,
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
that
assumes
the
very
answer
to
the
question
at
issue
and
that
is,
does
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
regulate
that
is
to
require
us
to
purchase
gas
and
that's
the
reason
we
say
that
section
1
(b)
is
important
because
the
commission
is
assuming
the
answer
to
the
question
that's
really
post
and
that
is
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
include
purchasing
of
gas.
it
does
not
give
the
commission
power
to
force
a
company
to
accept
the
rate
fixed
unilaterally
by
the
seller.
and
the
commission
can't
get
that
authority
by
saying
as
it
says
here
in
substance
that
if
we
don't
have
that
authority
then
this
company
is
going
to
abandon
facilities.
it
readily
begs
the
question.
we
haven't
abandon
facilities
baised
as
we
view
the
matter,
the
facility
is
still
there,
they're
operational.
they
can
be
used
at
anytime
to
transmit
gas
if
that's
necessary.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well
sir,
sunray
i
think
is
very
important
to
this
case
and
i
think
this
court
there
recognize
exactly
what
we're
saying
here.
now,
in
sunray
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well
sir,
our
obligations
to
distributors
of
course
we
have
and
we
haven't
quit
selling
gas
to
any
of
those
distributors.
we
haven't
curtailed
any
of
our
service.we
haven't
discontinued
any
service
and
we
have
no
obligation
to
continental.
and
i
think
your
honor
the
reason
that
you
used
this
own
request
and
i
think
it's
a
very
meaningful
term
is
in
recognition
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
think
it's
in
clear
recognition
of
the
whole
scheme
of
the
act.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
and
that
is
the
gas
was
bought
and
sold
in
contract.
and
also
in
the
contract
we
can't
be
forced
to
buy
gas.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
the
commission
didn't
so
far
as
the
abandonment
is
concern
i
think
if
these
are
the
powers
that
the
commission
would
exercise
in
these
circumstances
and
they
all
turn
to
the
available
continental.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
yes
sir,
there
are
a
lot
of
such
instances
because
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
during
the
entire
history
of
the
natural
gas
act,
it's
never
said
so
and
we've
done
it
before.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
it
take
the
position
here
necessarily
that
if
we
stop
buying
gas
that
we've
come
to
come
in
and
ask
for
some
kind
of
abandonment.
now,
if
we
continue
to
use
our
facilities
i
guess
it
would
make
us
ask
for
an
abandonment
or
ceasing
purchasing
soon.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir,
i
think
that's
what
they
tell.
now
here
they
have
said
its
abandonment
of
facilities
but
there
are
certain
circumstances
where
this
could
exist
for
example
and
it's
quite
common
that
we
have
facilities
built
into
a
field
where
we
buy
from
a
number
of
producers.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
facilities
sir
as
i
appreciate
it
means
those
physical
pipes,
meters,
valves
and
connections
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
land
rights,
i
suppose
might
be
included.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
never
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
never
understood
that
facilities
included
a
gas
reserve
in
the
ground.
we've
never
gotten
--
never
been
so
interpret
it.
it's
never
been
in
a
certificate
related
to
either
the
discovery
of
our
facility,
i
mean
of
gas
in
the
ground
are
at
the
time
you
as
a
pipe
line
buying
gas
that
is
contractually
agreed
to
purchase
gas,
all
we've
ever
gotten
--
all
the
commission
has
ever
issued
is
a
certificate
authorized
in
the
construction
of
a
pipe
and
the
valves
and
whatever
is
required
to
move
gas
and
it
authorized
you
to
operate
those
facilities.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
question.
it
would
--
it
has
power
to
authorize
us
to
abandon
the
contract.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
(inaudible),
yes.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
insofar
as
purchasing
gas
is
concern
sir.
our
sole
obligation
is
to
buy
that
to
which
we
are
contractually
committed.
and
i
don't
think
the
commission
has
power
to
force
us
to
buy
gas
in
any
circumstances.
i
don't
think
the
natural
gas
act
ever
contemplate
it.
and
i
think
the
whole
scheme
of
the
act
shows
it
very
clearly.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
i
think
not.
i
think
facilities
mean
what
they've
been
accepted
to
mean
all
these
years
on
the
natural
gas
act
and
that
is
those
facilities
require
to
move
gas
and
it
measure
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
you
say,
with
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
the
only
way
we
could
sell
gas
is
by
contract
that
is
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
--
with
our
customers.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
mr.
justice
brennan
that
have
been
the
law
along
before
sunray.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
there'd
never
been
any
question
about
really
what
the
seller's
obligation
is
including
sunray's
obligation.
now,
there's
never
been
any
question
about
what
united
gas
pipe
line
company's
obligation
to
its
customers
is.
this
act
was
designed
to
regulate
the
sale
of
gas
as
distinguished
in
the
purchase
of
gas.
we're
obligated
to
sell
gas
once
we
get
started
whether
we've
got
a
contract
or
not.
and
here's
what
you
said
sir
in
sunray
which
is
really
important
to
this
case.
you
said
that
while
to
that
extent
a
captive
of
the
act
which
is
true
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
while
to
that
extent
a
captive
of
the
act.
that
is
the
seller.
the
seller
still
has
no
reason
to
complain.
why?
because
he's
got
the
right
after
expiration
of
his
bilateral
contract
to
go
far
with
the
unilateral
contraction
arrangement.
he
can
file
his
own
rates
without
the
buyer's
consent.
now
we've
got
no
argument
with
that
proposition,
that's
always
been
the
law,
it's
the
law
before
sunray.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir
i
don't
think
the
commission
can
right
in
some
--
something
in
a
condition
as
contrary
to
the
act
itself,
it
can't
right
the
law.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
to
say
the
least,
we'd
have
the
option
looking
at
the
certificate
to
either
accept
it
or
reject
it.
we
don't
have
to
go
in
business
of
course.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
it
says
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
it
did
not.
all
this
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
yes,
should
of
course
subjected
as
to
the
commission's
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir.
commission's
rules
and
regulations
are
relevant
here
and
of
course
we're
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
a
certificate
issued
to
construct
and
operate
facilities
that
sincerely
carries
with
it
the
structural
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
since
that
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir,
it
said
that
very
clearly
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
commission
can
do
something
the
law
doesn't
permit
it
to
do.
that's
our
point.
they
can't
require
us
to
buy
gas
that
the
natural
gas
act
doesn't
authorize
them
to,
requires
to
buy
gas.
and
either
sir
can
they
make
us
accept
the
right.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
think
its
necessarily
an
answer
because
the
act
clearly
doesn't
cover
the
purchasing
of
gas.
and
i'd
like
to
get
back
sir
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
to
go
ahead
and
explain
that
sunray
while
the
seller
had
the
protection
of
being
able
to
unilaterally
to
file
an
increased
rate
and
therefore
is
assured
that
he's
going
to
get
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
his
gas
and
for
the
service
he
renders.
the
natural
gas
act
doesn't
give
that
protection
to
the
bar.
and
that's
the
reason
we're
in
this
difficulty
and
that
sir
is
the
whole
reason
we're
here
today.
there
is
no
way
that
united
can
recover
this
increased
costs
that
are
enforced
upon
it.
it
must
absorb
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that
it
thinks
continental's
rates
are
reasonable
as
to
continental's
sir.
but
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
us.
continental
might
conceivably
require
20
cents
or
25
cents
on
the
basis
of
its
investment
and
its
requirements
as
to
what's
just
and
reasonable
from
its
point
of
view.
you
see
sir
in
the
utility
concept,
it
is
the
seller's
cost
and
the
seller's
investment
that
determines
a
seller's
rights.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no,
i
think
that
you've
got
--
haven't
gotten
it.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
that
even
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
even
on
the
area
of
rate
concept
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it's
still
the
composite.
its
still
the
composite
of
the
seller's
cost.
it
still
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
pipe
lines.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
that's
right.
the
area
rate
concept
is
that
it's
all
the
sellers.
but
i'm
still
not
certain
that
this
court
is
going
to
say
to
continental
or
anybody,
if
it
cost
you
30
cents
to
produce
gas
that
you've
got
to
sell
it
at
15.
now
this
is
an
area
rate
concept
and
hasn't
yet
been
decided
by
this
court
but
the
point
here
is
that
its
still
a
--
its
still
the
seller's
costs
that
determines
the
rate
and
that
doesn't
help
united
gas
pipe
line
company
(inaudible).
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
be
making
exactly
the
same
argument
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
because
i
think
the
act
contemplates
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir.
if
its
--
it's
quite
meaningless
in
this
sense
and
we
think
the
natural
-
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
would
certainly
take
it
to
that
extreme
and
here
is
why
sir.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
congress
contemplated.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
it
contemplate
it
when
you
left
out
of
the
natural
gas
act.
not
only
the
provision
that
the
commission
could
require
purchasing
but
it
left
out
all
that
structure
of
the
act
that
would
go
along
with
protecting
the
purchaser
forced
to
buy
gas
and
forced
to
pay
a
price
to
which
it
hasn't
agreed.
it
wouldn't
leave
to
the
--
the
purchasers
such
as
united
and
the
position
where
the
only
way
it
can
sell
gas
is
by
contract.
but
it
would
--
given
the
commission
power
to
say
either
that
continental
rates
got
to
be
reduced
or
that
united's
contract
rates
can
be
increased
but
the
commission
doesn't
have
that
power
sir.
and
i
think
that's
--
i
think
congress
made
that
decision
deliberately
because
it
viewed
the
matter
in
this
respect
that
natural
gas
companies
while
they'
were
going
to
be
regulating,
still
they
were
subject
to
competition.
the
natural
gas
act
even
leaves
completely
unregulated
--
about
half
the
gas
it
sold
into
state
commerce
at
least
for
this
company
and
that
is
gas
sold
directly
to
industries.
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
those
but
nevertheless,
they're
telling
us
that
we
must
pay
continental's
unilateral
rate
for
gas
that
we
take
and
sell
to
industries.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir,
first
of
all,
they
can
apply
it
to
the
commission
for
an
abandonment
that
that
is
to
abandon
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
for
an
abandonment
that
is,
it
can
abandon
its
sale
to
us.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
abandon
its
sale,
the
certificate.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
they
could
do
whatever
they
could've
have
done
with
it
absent
the
act.
they
could
sell
it
to
somebody
else.
there
is
somebody
there's
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
trans
continental
gas
pipe
line
company
is
there.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
they're
purchasing
gas
in
the
same
field.
now
whether
or
not
they
want
it,
i
don't
know.
i
think
continental
tried
to
sell
it
to
them.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
if
it
--
if
there's
no
market
outlet
for
it,
the
natural
gas
act
--
and
i
think
this
is
important
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
either
remain
in
the
ground
or
if
its
common
purchase
statute
enacted
as
there
is
in
louisiana,
may
they
come
and
purchase
statute
could
be
used
to
compel
a
pipe
line
to
buy
it.
but
the
point
is,
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
accomplish
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it's
entirely
possible
that
if
there
are
other
wells
producing
that,
it
would
siphon
off
this
gas,
that's
right
sir.
but
united
has
also
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
it's
important
for
continental
to
sell
its
gas
and
it's
got
a
market.
we
offer
to
buy
it.
we
offer
to
buy
it
sir
on
the
same
basis
we've
been
buying.
we
offered
to
continue
the
status
quo
and
the
offer
remains
open.
the
argument
here
is
whether
or
not
we've
really
got
to
buy
--
got
to
pay
their
price
as
distinct
from
our
price.
and
if
it
--
if
it's
going
to
be
drained
your
honor
it's
because
they
choose
drainage
to
--
acceding
to
our
terms
in
the
contract
negotiation.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
absent
to
contract
agreement
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i'd
say
without
a
contract
agreement
as
between
continental
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
they
would
have
no
jurisdiction
on
that.
no
sir.
no
more
than
they
would
have
over
this
your
honor.
there
may
be
other
producers
in
that
field
who
have
gas
that
they
want
to
sell.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
congress
could
enact
such
a
law.
congress
turned
down
such
a
law.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
it
was
not
and
congress
turned
down
an
act
that
would
have
taken
care
of
the
situations
you're
talking
about
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that
was
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
it
means
this,
that
congress
considered
this
senate
resolution
1919
that
would've
made
the
pipe
line
a
common
purchaser
and
it
turned
it
down
and
it
adopted
instead
this
more
limited
act
which
contemplates
a
gas
will
be
both
bought
and
sold
on
a
contractual
basis
and
really
it
would
--
says,
that
the
bargaining
between
the
seller
on
the
bar
insofar
as
contract
is
concern,
its
not
to
be
superseded
by
this
act.
now,
just
one
remaining
point
sir,
had
we
been
a
common
purchaser,
had
congress
adopted
the
act
that
made
us
a
common
purchaser,
they
would
require
us
to
have
bought
this
gas.
and
there's
no
doubt
about
it
as
the
senate
resolution
itself
concluded.
the
commission
itself
would've
had
authority
to
pass
on
through
our
rates
these
increased
costs
that
they
are
forcing
on
us.
but
this
commission
doesn't
have
that
authority
under
this
act.
it
cannot
increase
our
rates
above
those
to
which
our
costumers
has
contractually
agreed.
and
it's
just
because
of
the
fact
that
we
are
being
forced
to
pay
prices
that
we
can't
recover.
that
we
are
being
loaded
with
costs
that
we
can't
pass
on.
and
the
commission
can't
pass
on
for
us.
that
be
his
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
has
filed
a
price,
yes
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
has
been
accepted
by
the
commission
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
continental
could
follow,
that's
the
rate.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
the
filed
rate
is
the
rate
they
must
charge
if
we
buy,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
black,
the
real
controversy
in
this
case
is
whether
we
can
be
forced
to
buy
a
gas
and
pay
a
price
fixed
unilaterally
by
the
seller
and
that's
the
controversy.
we
take
the
position
and
we
really
can't
stay
in
business
if
we
are
faced
to
that
prospect.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
price
is
fixed
by
continental
of
15.75
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that's
right.
now,
the
commission
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
the
point
is
that
the
commission
can
review
it
of
course.
but
it
reviews
from
continental's
needs.
now,
the
question
has
been
asked
whether
we
could
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
they
review
it
by
the
producer's
needs
if
that's
the
new
concept
but
still
it's
not
the
pipe
line's
needs.
in
other
words,
the
15.75
cents
is
what's
required
to
permit
the
producer
to
make
a
fair
return
in
his
investment.
all
the
producers
has
a
group,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
what
we
make,
the
pipe
line.
now,
the
answer
to
this
question
about
whether
we
can
get
yes,
cheaper
or
not;
there's
been
a
lot
of
conjecture
but
the
answer
is
we
can
and
if
we
--
as
act
after
congress
intended
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
we
can
get
it
cheaper
other
than
this.
we
can
get
a
cheaper
then
they
can
eventually
raise
these
prices
unilateral
and
we
can
bargain
with
continental,
we
can
probably
get
a
cheap
in
15.75
cents.
the
point
is
that
congress
intended
that
we
buy
gas
on
contract
and
we
sell
it
on
contract
and
if
we
are
left
to
our
bargaining
position
we
can
protect
ourselves
in
the
public.
now,
we
are
trying
to
get
its
continental.
we're
competing
with
these
people
but
in
markets
in
south
louisiana
and
south
texas,
they
can
take
that
gas
that
they
say
to
us,
you've
got
to
pay
15.75
cents
and
they
can
sell
it
to
the
city
of
like
charles
or
somebody
of
14
cents
but
we
can't
necessarily
prove
it
except
we
can
see
the
end-result
and
where
the
companies
got
to
deal
with
that.
we've
got
to
protect
ourselves
and
we've
got
to
protect
the
public
and
we
can
a
buy
gas
cheaper
in
intrastate
market
than
we
can
buy
in
interstate
market
than
they
will
sell
it
cheaper
and
it
can
be
both
cheaper
and
after
our
bargaining
strength
we
can
buy
a
cheaper.
not,
not
only
applies
in
this
case,
it
applies
to
us
all
across
south
louisiana
because
everyone
of
our
gas
contract
is
going
to
expire
down
there.
and
if
ever
producer
can
tell
us,
you
got
to
pay
the
maximum
price
the
commission
will
allow
now
and
in
future
and
we're
down
to
business.
and
mr.
black
and
mr.
justice
black
sir,
that's
a
controversy.
there's
nothing
that
that
commission
can
do
to
protect
us.
we
sell
our
gas
to
be
in,
we
sell
46%
of
our
gas,
the
record
is
in
--
the
commission
can't
do
anything
about
that,
it's
completely
beyond
jurisdiction.
they
can't
affect
those
rates.
they
can't
help
us
in
any
respect.
we
sell
that
gas,
we
fix
the
price
with
the
industry
and
if
we
sell
a
gas
at
16
cents,
we've
got
to
buy
it
about
12
cents
or
13
cents
and
we
have
got
the
bargaining
strength
that
we
have
all
through
the
history
of
this
natural
gas
act,
we
can
buy
it
that
way
by
a
particular
sale.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
you
mean,
why
can
we?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
for
the
very
good
reason
sir,
i
think
i'm
conjectured
as
to
why
the
producers
will
sell
it
cheaper.
it
avoids
a
great
deal
of
red
tape
in
government
regulation.
there's
no
regulation
that
reduce
the
price
intrastate.
he
just
sell
it
us
over
a
contract
and
the
day
the
contract
expires,
his
gas
again
and
he
will
sell
a
cheaper
because
of
that
fact.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
don't
know
but
i'm
saying
that
left
up
to
us.
left
up
to
us,
we
can
keep
it
from
a
down
and
we
can
protect
ourselves
and
we
can
protect
the
public.
this
is
the
public's
interest
we're
protecting
here
and
to
conclude
my
argument,
mr.
justice
white,
congress
considered
doing
what
you
were
talking
about
and
that
is
making
pipe
lines
common
carriers
and
common
purchasers.
it
did
so
in
the
senate
resolution
1919
and
it's
federal
resolution
we
referred
to
and
it
refused
to
do
so,
it
didn't
adopt
it.
now,
the
effect
to
that
would've
have
been
done
what
you're
talking
about
that
is
to
make
us
buy
and
the
transport
but
had
it
done
so,
sir?
had
it
done
so,
it
would
given
the
commission
a
power
the
commission
doesn't
have
and
that's
the
power
it's
been
talked
about
in
common
purchasers
statutes
before
this
court
and
that
is
the
regulatory
commission
would
had
the
authority
to
look
at
continental's
rate
with
reference
to
our
needs
and
with
reference
to
the
market
conditions
and
to
be
able
to
insure
that
their
price
is
long
enough
to
us
so
that
when
we
sold
it
that
we
would
make
a
fair
return
in
our
investment
and
our
facilities.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir,
that's
what
they're
saying.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
but
excuse
me.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no,
sir,
here's
the
issue
in
the
case
sir,
if
i
may,
if
you
may
excuse
me.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
where
the
commission
is
right
in
saying
that.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
alright,
so
then
it
comes
back
to
this
basic
proposition.
the
commission
is
saying
that
it
has
a
right
to
compel
us
to
purchase
gas
and
the
law
is
clear
that
it
does
not
have
that
right
to
compel
us
to
purchase
gas,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir,
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
that.
we
bought
some
gas
and
we
did
pay
some
more
money
for
it
but
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
we
did
it
under
a
circumstances
where
we
were
faced
with
a
producer
coming
to
us
and
saying,
it
isn't
--
it
wasn't
this
area,
it
was
in
part
to
the
east
but
it
came
to
us
and
said,
i'm
going
to
lose
my
well,
i
got
one
well
here,
will
you
buy
this
gas?"
well,
now
we've
lived
in
that
area
for
40
years
down
there
and
we
didn't
want
him
to
lose
his
well
and
we
did
buy
his
well.
it
didn't
go
in
this
whole
amount
of
area,
it
went
over
to
new
orleans
there
and
we
bought
the
gas
for
18
cents
but
it
was
not
substitute
for
this
gas
and
the
record
reflects
that
it
was.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
(voice
overlap).
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way
sir,
we
bought
the
gas
down
there
because
and
the
male
was
going
to
lose
his
well
and
it
took
18
--
i
mean
their
18
cents
to
go
and
rate
down
there
and
it
was
a
contractual
arrangement.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
that
was
a
rate
in
that
area
at
that
time
yes
sir
for
buying
gas
and
contractual
arrangement
and
we
bought
it
rather
than
seeing
those
as
well.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir
that
was
a
new
--
that
was
a
new
sale,
new
small
amount
of
gas
and
not
a
new
sale
i
think
you
could
get
at
that
time
about
20
cents
or
something
of
the
fpc
jurisdiction.
we
still
didn't
pay
the
maximum
price
the
fpc
would
allow
to
interstate.
our
buyers
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
we
had
not.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
what
is
it?
it's
a
--
the
area
guideline
is
21
and
a
half,
isn't
that
if
when
you
got?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
21
of
course,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
this
is
old
gas
down
there.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
you
mean,
what
we're
paying
them?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
we
were
paying
them
10.79
cents
per
mcf.
we
started
that
contract
11
or
12
years
ago,
(inaudible).
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
assume
they
would
take
our
position
that
of
course
-
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
suppose
to
me
they
have
said
this,
they
have
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
they
say
facilities
and
they
ought
to,
counsel
here
to
appreciate
talks
about
services,
maybe
the
commission
did
mention
service
somewhere
sir.
but
service
once
again,
be
it
facilities
or
service
that
still
doesn't
give
the
commission
power
they
just
otherwise
have.
and
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
mr.
justice
white
where
they
talked
about
facilities
or
service.
if
they
don't
have
power
to
force
us
to
purchasing
--
to
purchase
gas
then
they
don't
have
a
power
to
do
so.
it
just
simply
begs
the
question
to
say
well,
we
can
force
you
to
purchase
it
because
we
got
jurisdiction
of
your
billing
or
your
pipeline
or
something
of
that
nature.
the
days
going
to
come
when
our
pipelines
will
be
full
of
gas
because
of
the
perhaps
the
theory
in
production
or
something
and
they're
going
to
--
are
they
going
to
move
in
and
say
you've
got
to
go
out
and
buy
gas
some
place
to
philadelphia,
that's
read
of
the
question
and
you've
got
to
pay
the
price
that
we
tell
you.
we
don't
really
object
to
that
if
the
bills
amended
to
take
care
of
us
in
term
but
we
don't
think
it's
in
the
public
interest,
we
don't
think
congress
thought
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
sir.
may
i
explain
just
one
moment?
the
producer
is
an
absent
no
different
position
from
what
the
pipeline
or
any
other
utility
had
been
in
all
the
existence
of
utility
law.
once
a
pipeline
begins
to
serve
a
customer,
an
account
boarded
customer,
a
distributor,
he
can't
stop
serving
that
distributor.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
and
neither
can
the
producer
stop
serving
us
but
here's
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that
distributor
doesn't
have
to
buy
a
foot
of
gas
from
us,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
one
cent
for
that
gas
that
he
doesn't
contractually
agree
to
and
maybe
that's
the
whole
point
of
this
argument.
and
we're
in
the
same
position
that
distributor
yes.
we
are
the
bar
here
and
the
natural
gas
act
doesn't
compel
that
distributor
to
buy
one
foot
of
gas
from
us
or
to
pay
one
cent
for
it.
he
doesn't
contract
to
agree
to
and
if
the
fpc
increased
our
price,
he
doesn't
have
to
buy
if
he
doesn't
contract
to
agree
to
it.
the
fpc
has
said,
it
can't
force
the
distributor
to
buy
gas
from
us
and
it
can.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir
they
have
protection.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
they
can
go
to
the
commission
and
say,
is
they
did
in
rutherford
case.
this
company
won't
buy
a
gas
from
us
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir
i
accepted
under
my
in
the
deal
when
i
sell
the
distributor.
the
point
is
that
the
act
regulates
the
sale
and
it
was
intended
to
continue
the
sale
of
gas.
it
never
was
intended
to
force
the
purchasing
of
gas.
so
long
as
the
purchaser
owns
gas,
the
sellers
got
to
sell
it
but
he's
got
protection
sir.
he
can
file
unilaterally,
a
rate
is
fair
and
reasonable
from
his
point
of
view
and
we
can
do
it
when
we
sell
the
distributor.
we
have
lots
of
distributors
refuses
on
the
contract
with
these
ones
who
initiated
service
but
the
man
that
we
continue
service.
now,
we're
complaining
that
that
distributor
can't
be
force
to
buy
from
us.
we
don't
think
that's
an
equitable
regulation
and
we
don't
think
it's
inequitable
when
the
pipe
line
isn't
force
to
buy
up
and
the
seller
in
the
form
of
producer.
now,
the
act
might
have
been
written
differently.
we
might
have
been
made
it
common
carrier
or
common
purchaser
and
there
would
be
a
lot
of
remedies
to
us
under
the
act,
but
congress
didn't
arrive
that
way
sir.
congress
intended
to
do
one
thing
really
and
that's
to
regulate
the
sale
of
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
it
did
not
adopt
that
act
that
would
regulate
the
purchase
of
gas.
it
did
not
choose
to
make
us
common
purchasers
and
it
done
so
we've
been
entirely
different
act.
now,
this
been
about
getting
a
gas
to
the
market
and
about
protecting
the
continental
and
so
forth
in
these
circumstances,
it
may
well
be
the
common
purchase
allows
the
good
thing,
it
ought
to
be
adopted
by
congress.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
louisiana,
sir
has
a
common
purchaser
act
and
continental
maybe
in
the
wrong
court.
it
could
have
gone
to
the
court
such
as
louisiana
department
of
conservation
and
said,
i
want
to
exercise
my
rights
in
the
common
purchase
of
law
of
louisiana
and
i
want
you
to
force
united
to
buy
my
gas
that
had
been
done
so.
we
could've
told
continental.
we'll
give
you
to
go
in
to
your
rate
under
louisiana
law.
but
the
difference
is
that
the
natural
gas
act
is
not
a
common
purchase
of
law
and
that's
really
what's
this
whole
thing
is
about
and
if
it
were
written
to
common
purchase
of
law
and
if
we
had
the
protection
that
the
common
purchase
of
law
would
give
us,
then
we
wouldn't
be
here
complaining.
but
we
don't
have
that
protection
(voice
overlap).
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
sir.
and
we
have
to
protect
ourselves
and
we
protect
the
public.
we're
competing
with
this.
this
gentleman
right
here
for
the
same
market
in
that
area,
and
if
we
go
and
buy
this
gas
cheaper,
it
helps
us
in
the
public.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir.
we
have
an
affiliate
that
produces
gas.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
we
have
an
affiliate
that
produces
gas
but
my
point
is
if
not
necessarily
continental,
there
are
numerous
producers
who
have
a
supply
of
gas
to
that
area
and
if
they
can
arrange
the
city
gate
or
with
the
big
initiate
to
buy
the
gas
they
will
build
a
pipeline
right
straight
up
for
that
city
gate
to
that
industry
and
they
were
selling
to
him
and
they're
going
to
sell
us,
while
they
--
at
the
same
able
to
tell
us
what
we
got
the
pay
for
gas.
now,
that's
a
problem
we
have
to
meet
and
so
that's
the
reason
we're
up
here
is
to
stay
in
this,
wherever
they
must.
now,
conceivably
we
can
have
alone
some
of
these
(inaudible),
we
can
absorb
some
of
these
cause
of
course.
the
fact
that
it
jump
from
10
to
15
cents
is
not
going
to
let
us
go
out
of
business,
but
all
of
our
contracts.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
what
did
they
say
to
us?
they
said,
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
they
said,
yes
exactly
what
mr.
schiff
has
said.
that
if
you
come
to
us
and
ask
us,
if
you
can
stop
this
purchase
and
our
position
is
that
we've
got
to
ask
you
we're
in
trouble
to
begin
with
but
there's
no
point
in
asking
but
the
law
doesn't
require
us
to
do
it
and
that's
really
what
we
are
arguing
about,
the
way
the
natural
gas
act
is
written.
now,
of
course
if
we've
got
to
ask
some
of
it,
if
it
turns
out
that
the
date
of
the
abandonment
of
facilities
means
that
they've
got
the
right
to
force
us
to
buy
gas
and
we'll
go
back
to
that
and
i
know
what
they're
going
to
say.
they're
going
to
say,
well,
please
go
and
absorb
that,
that's
not
much.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
basically
absorb
this
increase
cost.it
doesn't
matter
that
you
got
fixed
contract
down
the
line
that
you
sell
to
end
user,
i
really
think
that's
what
they
would
say.
but
the
point
is,
sir,
they
don't
have
the
power
to
do
it.
they
don't
have
the
power
to
require
us
to
purchase
gas,
the
natural
gas
act
just
as
written
that
way.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
united
gas
pipe
line
company
is
a
natural
gas
company
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
purchasing
gas
from
producers
in
the
field,
transporting
that
gas
through
pipe
lines
and
then
selling
it
to
distributors
for
resale
and
to
industry
directly
for
there
own
use.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
it
grows
out
of
an
order
issued
by
the
federal
power
commission.
that
order
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
natural
gas
act
in
this
38
and
this
is
an
act
of
1938.
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
act,
the
federal
power
commission
has
assumed
they
had
power
to
order
a
pipe
line
to
purchase
gas.
moreover,
to
pay
a
price
fixed
unilaterally
by
the
seller
and
finally
to
purchase
quantities
in
volumes
consistent
with
the
cancelled
contract.
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
posed
two
questions,
whether
the
federal
power
commission
in
fact
had
a
power,
authority
to
order
a
pipe
line
without
its
consent
to
continue
purchasing
gas
after
the
producer
had
cancelled
the
contract
in
which
a
pipe
line
had
been
buying
gas
whether
it
had
authority
to
order
the
pipe
line
to
pay
the
unilaterally
increased
price
fixed
by
the
seller
for
that
gas.
the
second
question
being
that
if
the
act
have
--
that
in
it
which
permits
the
commission
to
issue
such
an
order
then
is
the
act
to
that
extent
unconstitutional
as
violative
for
the
due
process
requirements
just
compensation
required
by
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
facts
are
undisputed
and
can
be
stated
briefly
and
they're
important
to
this
petition
to
show
the
problem
that
it
is
faced
with
by
the
commission's
order.
in
january
1953,
united
and
continental
oil
company
entered
into
a
contract
under
the
terms
in
which
continental
agreed
to
sell
and
united
agreed
to
buy
gas
produced
by
continental
oil
company
in
the
junction
bayou
field.
the
junction
bayou
field
is
located
in
cameron
parish
which
is
right
in
the
southwest
corner
of
louisiana
next
to
the
texas
boundary
or
border.
a
contract
of
a
ten
year
primary
term
with
the
provision
that
it
would
automatically
continue
in
effect
after
expiration
of
the
primary
term
provided
that
either
party
could
cancel
the
contract
upon
90
days
prior
written
notice.
the
contract
also
provided
fixed
prices
to
be
paid
for
the
gas.
two
prices,
the
one
in
effect
at
the
end
of
the
primary
term.
that
is
the
second
5
year
period
of
the
contract
was
10.79
cents
per
mcf
inclusive
of
tax
reimbursement.
in
other
words,
united
gas
line
company
was
paying
continental
10.79
cents
per
mcf
as
the
contract
was
nearing
the
end
of
its
primary
term.
now,
this
contract
would've
continued
automatically
in
effect.
but
for
the
fact,
the
continental
oil
company
some
90
days
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
primary
term
wrote
to
united
and
said,
we
cancel
the
contract.
and
united
accepted
the
letter.
it
was
canceled
on
the
terms
of
the
contract.
thereafter
united
rather
continental
came
to
united
and
said,
we'd
like
to
negotiate
with
you.
we'd
like
to
enter
to
a
new
contract
covering
the
injunction,
bayou
field
gas.
and
it
is
,fine,
let's
talk
about
it.
continental
said
in
substance
that
we
want
to
increase
the
price
by
our
standards,
united
standards
substantially.
they
ordered
the
price
to
go
up
to
approximately
18
cents
in
mcf.
that
is
over
the
whole
term
of
the
contract.
they
would've
started
a
little
less
than
that
about
15.75.
but
they
had
something
else
in
there
that
was
completely
unacceptable
to
united.
they
said
that,
we
wanted
to
remain
open-ended.
with
the
idea
in
mind
that
you
will
agree
contractually
that
if
the
federal
power
commission
will
permit
a
higher
price
or
different
--
a
higher
price
and
that
to
which
we've
agreed
contractually
in
the
so-called
area
rate
proceeding,
that
we
may
charge
that
rate
and
you
must
pay
it.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
there
are
area
rate
proceeding,
yes
sir,
affecting
south
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
as
i
appreciated
the
federal
power
commission
contemplates
that
it
would
enter
an
order
stating
that
all
gas
sold
in
south
louisiana
will
be
sold
at
a
specific
price,
18.50
cents,
that
is
as
an
initial
rate.
i
think
that
they
probably
contemplate
that
gas
which
is
defined
as
all
gas
would
be
sold
at
a
lesser
rate.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
yes.
i
think
it
will
apply
to
existing
contracts
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that's
exactly
what
it
does
mean
sir.
that
means
at
the
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
because
of
this,
we
wished
to
had
the
--
we
wished
to
have
a
prize
that
was
fixed.
it's
very
well
possible.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
it
makes
a
very
great
deal
of
difference
to
us,
sir
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
--
in
this
sense.
yes,
but
it
makes
a
difference
in
this
sense.
that
we
sell
gas
in
turn
and
here
is
really
the
crux
of
this
problem.
we
sell
gas
in
turn
and
we
sell
it
the
only
way
we
can
sell
it
under
the
act
and
that's
a
contraction
to
fixed
rates.
the
federal
power
commission
can't
come
along
and
increase
of
those
rates.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
let
me
say
this,
we
do
not
have
to
abide
by
the
area
price
if
we
agreed
to
a
lower
price.
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
in
other
words
if
we
contractually
agree,
continental
and
united,
this
gas
will
sell
for
15
cents
in
mcf
and
the
area
price
eventually
comes
out
and
says
that
the
maximum
allowable
price
is
18
cents.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
that's
what
it
would
be.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
won't
be
appraised
that
every
bit
of
gas
has
got
to
be
sold
that's
if
there
are
lesser
contract
prizes
then
as
i
appreciate
the
area
price
it
doesn't
--
published
by
the
federal
power
commission.
they
will
not
supersede
those
lesser
prices.
it
will
not
make
unlawful
continental's
agreement
to
sell
us
gas
at
15
cents
simply
because
the
federal
power
commission
said
the
gas,
the
maximum
price
it
can
be
charged
is
18
cents.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
did
not
make
it
clear
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
apologize
for
not
having
made
it
clear.
in
any
event
these
negotiations
proceeded
on
this
basis.
united
said
we're
willing
to
buy
your
gas
but
we
want
to
charge,
we
won't
--
we're
going
to
pay
a
specific
prize.
it
was
the
price
that
we
would
then
pay.
there
were
circumstances
as
we
thought,
that
was
the
appropriate
level.
continental
said,
we
don't
agree
with
that.
any
event
the
parties
could
not
get
together.
at
that
point
continental
went
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
filed
its
rate
that
it
asked
us
for
unilaterally
with
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
federal
power
commission
accepted
it
and
made
it
effective.
now,
there
are
these
other
aspects
of
the
case
that
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
of.
first
of
all
when
continental
undertook
to
sell
us
his
gas,
actually
the
philips
case,
it
came
to
the
federal
power
commission
to
obtain
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
authorizing
it
to
sell
the
gas
to
united.
united
also
when
it
undertook
to
buy
this
gas
out
at
the
injunction
bayou
field
it
had
an
existence,
a
pipeline,
it
ran
from
the
southwest
corner
of
louisiana
over
into
texas
and
this
gas
is
located
close
to
that
pipeline.
we
had
to
build
certain
minimal
facilities
to
receive
this
gas
into
our
system.
meter
station
and
tubing
that
came
into
our
line
and
we
asked
the
federal
power
commission
for
a
certificate
authorizing
us
to
construct
and
operate
those
facilities.
we
also
received
an
authorization
to
move
this
gas
and
to
transport
in
into
state
commerce.
now,
at
the
time
the
federal
power
commission
accepted
the
increase
rate
filed
unilaterally
by
continental
which
was
the
rate
they
demanded
of
us
and
which
weren't
willing
to
read
to
contractually.
the
commission
advised
upon
continental's
request
that
it
would
be
come
effective
at
the
end
of
the
primary
term
of
the
contract
which
was
january
31,
1963,
the
date
that
continental
had
made
its
cancellation
effective.
united
did
not
then
accept
any
gas
from
continental
after
that
date.
it
did
not
do
so
because
it
did
not
wish
to
pay
that
price
for
the
gas
and
because
he
believed
that
the
bargaining
processes
were
left
intact.
if
he
weren't
forced
to
buy
this
gas,
that
they
could
bargain
with
continental
and
then
forget
the
gas
in
his
judgment
and
price
it
though
as
appropriate
and
proper
for
sale
in
the
beaumont
area
where
this
gas
in
actually
transported.
now
in
that
connection,
united
sells
gas
in
the
southeast
part
of
texas
around
beaumont
where
it
takes
this
gas.
its
sells
are
not
only
to
city
gates,
that
is
to
distributors
for
resale
in
the
city
of
beaumont
but
it
sells
a
very
great
quantities
of
gas
directly
to
industries
and
on
the
only
and
the
only
way
you
can
sell
it
of
course
is
by
contract
and
it
sells
there
at
contractually
fixed
rates.
now
in
addition
to
that
fact
united
is
faced
in
this
area
as
it
is
in
the
whole
of
south
texas
and
south
louisiana,
the
very
active
and
very
strenuous
competition
for
its
markets
is
faced
with
competition
by
intrastate
suppliers
who
are
willing
to
sell
their
gas
directly
to
industries
or
to
town
borders
often
times
at
prices
cheaper
than
the
federal
power
commission
had
itself
reflected
in
its
approval
of
rates
and
so
fort
filed
by
independent
producers
such
as
continental.
so
united
is
--
the
point
is
that
we
are
faced
there
with
very
active
competition,
the
federal
power
commission
has
itself
ruled
in
a
case
involving
united
that
it
cannot
protect
united
selling
gas
to
even
a
city
gate,
that
that
is
a
distributor
for
resale
from
intrastate
competition.
it
said
to
united
that
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction
extends
only
to
interstate
commerce.
if
there's
intrastate
commerce
that
you
must
compete
with
then
you
must
take
care
of
yourself.
now
the
point
of
it
is
that
in
the
structure
of
the
act,
united
gas
pipe
line
company
as
a
pipe
line
sells
gas
by
contract.
that's
the
only
way
it
can
sell
gas.
it
has
to
compete
with
other
suppliers
and
it
has
to
compete
with
other
fuels
and
it
has
to
sell
gas
to
industries
for
example
on
the
basis
of
contractually
fixed
rates.
now
that
is
the
way
the
act
is
designed
and
that's
the
scheme
of
the
act.
and
in
order
to
do
that
united
must
determine
what
it
can
afford
to
pay
for
gas.
it's
not
here
so
much
concern
with
the
fact
that
the
federal
power
commission
may
view
continental
15.75
cents
which
it
filled
as
fair
and
reasonable
from
continental's
point
of
view.
that
is
not
our
concern.
our
concern
is
that
we
must
buy
gas
that
we
can
sell
in
competition
in
southwest
texas
and
still
make
a
profit
and
we
must
buy
gas
at
a
price
that
we
can
sell
under
contractually
fixed
rate
and
still
make
a
profit
and
that
we
under
the
act
are
the
only
one
that
determine
that
fact.
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
do
it.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well
let's
see,
section
5
(a)
provides
that
the
commission
may
up
on
motion
institute
a
proceeding
to
determine
a
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rate
of
any
natural
gas
company
subject
to
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
upon
a
complaint.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
that's
correct
sir,
either
a
complaint
upon
its
own
motion.
how
do
i
reconcile
that
and
how
do
that
fit
into
this
problem
here?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
it
has
broad
rate
making
powers
on
this
sense
sir.
that
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
inquiring
in
this
case
into
the
rate
that
continental
is
charging
for
this
gas
and
the
question
that
it
would
seek
to
determine
there
is
whether
continental's
rate
is
just
and
reasonable
measured
by
what
test
measured
by
the
financial
requirements
of
continental
that
is
the
producer's
requirements.
it's
measuring
it
by
the
sellers'
requirements
as
distinguish
from
the
buyers'
requirements.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
well
to
begin
it
the
commission
has
no
power
to
fix
any
rate,
the
commission
cannot
make
rates.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that's
the
law
sir,
i
think.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
actually
what
had
actually
happened
here
was
that
continental
unilaterally
decided
on
the
rate
it
would
charge
entirely.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
the
commission
had
issued
some
orders
in
a
so-called
policy
statement
in
a
docket
61-1
which
said
this,
that
these
are
guideline
rates.
and
you're
right
sir,
they
were
certain
rates
that
had
been
fixed
and
they
were
to
be
employed
by
the
commission
not
as
the
rate
that
would
be
charged
necessarily
by
the
any
particular
producer
but
as
the
basis
on
which
they
would
either
suspend
an
act.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
not
on
section
5,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no,
i
didn't
understand
that
he
was
--
he
placed
on
reliance
as
i
appreciate
it
on
the
fact
that
15.75
cents
have
been
fixed
by
the
commission
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
--
as
a
guideline
rate.
united
thinks
that
the
commission
was
never
intended
that
the
natural
gas
act
to
have
power
to
do
what
its
done
in
this
order
that
is
to
order
the
purchasing
of
gas
are
the
acceptance
of
a
rate
filed
unilaterally
by
the
seller.
now
we
think
that's
true
for
basically
for
the
reasons.
first
of
all
the
act
very
clearly
does
not
include
and
encompass
and
bring
within
the
commission's
jurisdiction
that
purchasing
of
gas.
secondly,
the
act
quite
clearly
provides
that
act
--
that
rates
had
to
be
fixed
by
a
contract.
that
is
that
the
commission
itself
does
not
fix
rates.
that
natural
gas
companies
fix
rates
and
file
them
and
they're
reviewed
by
the
commission.
and
that
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
do
what
is
done
here
and
that
is
to
force
the
natural
gas
company
to
accept
any
rate.
that
unless
a
consent
is
given
first
to
the
natural
gas
company
to
accept
the
rate
which
it
can
be
reviewed
by
commission
that
the
commission
itself
have
no
authority
to
supply
that
agreement
to
a
rate.
thirdly,
we
think
under
the
scheme
of
the
act,
the
detrimental
effects
have
opened
this
to
united
gas
pipe
line
company
illustrate
that
the
act
was
never
intended
to
place
a
company
in
a
position
were
it
had
to
buy
gas
or
had
to
pay
a
particular
rate.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
company
itself
sells
the
gas
under
contraction
arrangements
and
it
is
only
under
those
circumstances
that
he
can
sell
gas
and
that
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
increase
his
own
sales
rate
that
is
the
company's
sales
rates
in
order
to
recover
to
that
company.
the
increase
calls
to
--
are
forced
upon
it
by
unilaterally
increased
rates
by
the
seller.
now,
let
me
fix
the
first
proposition
and
that
is
that
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
include
the
purchasing
of
gas.
the
scope
of
the
natural
gas
act
is
defined
by
section
1
(b)
of
the
act.
and
section
1
(b)
says
that
the
act
extends
to
the
transportation
and
sale
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
the
companies
engage
in
such
transportation
and
sales.
for
emphasis
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
point
out
that
the
government
here
concedes
that
section
1
(b)
does
not
include
purchasing.
page
5
of
its
brief
in
opposition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
the
government
says,
although
section
1
(b)
does
not
explicitly
bring
within
the
commission's
regulatory
power
the
purchase
of
natural
gas,
it
does
give
the
commission
authority
over
the
transportation
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
the
government
has
conceded
what
is
obvious
and
that
is
that
this
act
was
not
designed
to
regulate
the
purchasing
or
the
procurement
of
natural
gas.
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
establishes
that
congress
adopted
an
act
that
it
knew
did
not
include
or
extend
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
the
purchasing
or
procurement
of
natural
gas.
this
is
true
because
in
january
--
in
july
1937
at
the
time
the
natural
gas
act
was
being
considered
by
congress
there
was
--
it
introduced
into
congress
a
bill
in
both
houses,
it's
in
the
bill
1717
or
1919
which
would
have
given
the
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
procurement
or
purchasing
of
natural
gas
by
pipe
lines.
now,
that
bill
was
not
adopted
that
is
itself
clearly
reflects
the
fact
that
congress
rejected
the
type
of
thing
that
the
commission
is
undertaking
here
to
say
is
true.
congress
did
not
intend
to
give
the
commission
power
to
make
a
common
purchase
so
to
speak
out
of
a
pipe
line,
are
to
require
to
purchase
gas
other
than
on
a
contractual
basis
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
with
the
wording
of
section
1
(b)
of
the
act
which
does
not
include
purchasing.
those
sections
of
the
act
on
which
commission
here
relies,
the
certificate
section
of
the
act
does
not
authorize
the
commission
to
issue
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
purchase
gas.
the
commission
has
never
issued
such
a
certificate.
consistent
therewith
section
7
(b)
which
is
the
abandonment
section
of
the
act
does
not
authorize
the
commission
to
issue
an
abandonment
to
stop
purchasing
gas.
the
word
purchasing
doesn't
appear
in
either
of
those
two
sections
at
all.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
the
language
of
7
(b),
it
applies
to
all
natural
gas
companies,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
applies
to
a
pipe
line
company.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
says
no
natural
gas
company,
is
that
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
the
commission
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
i
very
much
think
i
should.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
to
begin
with,
you're
right.
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
it
has
the
power
to
order
the
purchasing
of
gas
and
the
payment
of
this
unilaterally
increased
priced
because
it
has
authority
to
authorize
the
abandonment
of
facilities
and
it
said
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
permission
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does
comprehend
that
and
we've
so
argued
it
the
commission.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
think
that's
a
large
part
of
it
and
i
think
the
rest
of
the
act
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
no,
i
think
it
all
ties
together
your
honor.
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
the
act
doesn't
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
doesn't
permit
the
commission
to
do
what
it's
undertaken
to
do.
the
commission
has
--
to
get
to
the
point
that's
raise
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
taken
the
position
that
united
here
has
a
duty
to
continue
purchasing
gas
and
therefore
to
operate
these
facilities
and
that
unless
it
does
so
its
abandon
facilities
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
now,
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
that
assumes
the
very
answer
to
the
question
at
issue
and
that
is,
does
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
regulate
that
is
to
require
us
to
purchase
gas
and
that's
the
reason
we
say
that
section
1
(b)
is
important
because
the
commission
is
assuming
the
answer
to
the
question
that's
really
post
and
that
is
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
include
purchasing
of
gas.
it
does
not
give
the
commission
power
to
force
a
company
to
accept
the
rate
fixed
unilaterally
by
the
seller.
and
the
commission
can't
get
that
authority
by
saying
as
it
says
here
in
substance
that
if
we
don't
have
that
authority
then
this
company
is
going
to
abandon
facilities.
it
readily
begs
the
question.
we
haven't
abandon
facilities
baised
as
we
view
the
matter,
the
facility
is
still
there,
they're
operational.
they
can
be
used
at
anytime
to
transmit
gas
if
that's
necessary.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well
sir,
sunray
i
think
is
very
important
to
this
case
and
i
think
this
court
there
recognize
exactly
what
we're
saying
here.
now,
in
sunray
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well
sir,
our
obligations
to
distributors
of
course
we
have
and
we
haven't
quit
selling
gas
to
any
of
those
distributors.
we
haven't
curtailed
any
of
our
service.we
haven't
discontinued
any
service
and
we
have
no
obligation
to
continental.
and
i
think
your
honor
the
reason
that
you
used
this
own
request
and
i
think
it's
a
very
meaningful
term
is
in
recognition
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
think
it's
in
clear
recognition
of
the
whole
scheme
of
the
act.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
and
that
is
the
gas
was
bought
and
sold
in
contract.
and
also
in
the
contract
we
can't
be
forced
to
buy
gas.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
the
commission
didn't
so
far
as
the
abandonment
is
concern
i
think
if
these
are
the
powers
that
the
commission
would
exercise
in
these
circumstances
and
they
all
turn
to
the
available
continental.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
yes
sir,
there
are
a
lot
of
such
instances
because
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
during
the
entire
history
of
the
natural
gas
act,
it's
never
said
so
and
we've
done
it
before.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
it
take
the
position
here
necessarily
that
if
we
stop
buying
gas
that
we've
come
to
come
in
and
ask
for
some
kind
of
abandonment.
now,
if
we
continue
to
use
our
facilities
i
guess
it
would
make
us
ask
for
an
abandonment
or
ceasing
purchasing
soon.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir,
i
think
that's
what
they
tell.
now
here
they
have
said
its
abandonment
of
facilities
but
there
are
certain
circumstances
where
this
could
exist
for
example
and
it's
quite
common
that
we
have
facilities
built
into
a
field
where
we
buy
from
a
number
of
producers.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
facilities
sir
as
i
appreciate
it
means
those
physical
pipes,
meters,
valves
and
connections
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
land
rights,
i
suppose
might
be
included.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
never
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
never
understood
that
facilities
included
a
gas
reserve
in
the
ground.
we've
never
gotten
--
never
been
so
interpret
it.
it's
never
been
in
a
certificate
related
to
either
the
discovery
of
our
facility,
i
mean
of
gas
in
the
ground
are
at
the
time
you
as
a
pipe
line
buying
gas
that
is
contractually
agreed
to
purchase
gas,
all
we've
ever
gotten
--
all
the
commission
has
ever
issued
is
a
certificate
authorized
in
the
construction
of
a
pipe
and
the
valves
and
whatever
is
required
to
move
gas
and
it
authorized
you
to
operate
those
facilities.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
question.
it
would
--
it
has
power
to
authorize
us
to
abandon
the
contract.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
(inaudible),
yes.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
insofar
as
purchasing
gas
is
concern
sir.
our
sole
obligation
is
to
buy
that
to
which
we
are
contractually
committed.
and
i
don't
think
the
commission
has
power
to
force
us
to
buy
gas
in
any
circumstances.
i
don't
think
the
natural
gas
act
ever
contemplate
it.
and
i
think
the
whole
scheme
of
the
act
shows
it
very
clearly.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
i
think
not.
i
think
facilities
mean
what
they've
been
accepted
to
mean
all
these
years
on
the
natural
gas
act
and
that
is
those
facilities
require
to
move
gas
and
it
measure
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
you
say,
with
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
the
only
way
we
could
sell
gas
is
by
contract
that
is
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
--
with
our
customers.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
mr.
justice
brennan
that
have
been
the
law
along
before
sunray.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
there'd
never
been
any
question
about
really
what
the
seller's
obligation
is
including
sunray's
obligation.
now,
there's
never
been
any
question
about
what
united
gas
pipe
line
company's
obligation
to
its
customers
is.
this
act
was
designed
to
regulate
the
sale
of
gas
as
distinguished
in
the
purchase
of
gas.
we're
obligated
to
sell
gas
once
we
get
started
whether
we've
got
a
contract
or
not.
and
here's
what
you
said
sir
in
sunray
which
is
really
important
to
this
case.
you
said
that
while
to
that
extent
a
captive
of
the
act
which
is
true
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
while
to
that
extent
a
captive
of
the
act.
that
is
the
seller.
the
seller
still
has
no
reason
to
complain.
why?
because
he's
got
the
right
after
expiration
of
his
bilateral
contract
to
go
far
with
the
unilateral
contraction
arrangement.
he
can
file
his
own
rates
without
the
buyer's
consent.
now
we've
got
no
argument
with
that
proposition,
that's
always
been
the
law,
it's
the
law
before
sunray.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir
i
don't
think
the
commission
can
right
in
some
--
something
in
a
condition
as
contrary
to
the
act
itself,
it
can't
right
the
law.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
to
say
the
least,
we'd
have
the
option
looking
at
the
certificate
to
either
accept
it
or
reject
it.
we
don't
have
to
go
in
business
of
course.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
it
says
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
it
did
not.
all
this
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
yes,
should
of
course
subjected
as
to
the
commission's
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir.
commission's
rules
and
regulations
are
relevant
here
and
of
course
we're
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
a
certificate
issued
to
construct
and
operate
facilities
that
sincerely
carries
with
it
the
structural
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
since
that
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir,
it
said
that
very
clearly
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
commission
can
do
something
the
law
doesn't
permit
it
to
do.
that's
our
point.
they
can't
require
us
to
buy
gas
that
the
natural
gas
act
doesn't
authorize
them
to,
requires
to
buy
gas.
and
either
sir
can
they
make
us
accept
the
right.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
think
its
necessarily
an
answer
because
the
act
clearly
doesn't
cover
the
purchasing
of
gas.
and
i'd
like
to
get
back
sir
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
to
go
ahead
and
explain
that
sunray
while
the
seller
had
the
protection
of
being
able
to
unilaterally
to
file
an
increased
rate
and
therefore
is
assured
that
he's
going
to
get
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
his
gas
and
for
the
service
he
renders.
the
natural
gas
act
doesn't
give
that
protection
to
the
bar.
and
that's
the
reason
we're
in
this
difficulty
and
that
sir
is
the
whole
reason
we're
here
today.
there
is
no
way
that
united
can
recover
this
increased
costs
that
are
enforced
upon
it.
it
must
absorb
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that
it
thinks
continental's
rates
are
reasonable
as
to
continental's
sir.
but
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
us.
continental
might
conceivably
require
20
cents
or
25
cents
on
the
basis
of
its
investment
and
its
requirements
as
to
what's
just
and
reasonable
from
its
point
of
view.
you
see
sir
in
the
utility
concept,
it
is
the
seller's
cost
and
the
seller's
investment
that
determines
a
seller's
rights.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no,
i
think
that
you've
got
--
haven't
gotten
it.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
that
even
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
even
on
the
area
of
rate
concept
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it's
still
the
composite.
its
still
the
composite
of
the
seller's
cost.
it
still
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
pipe
lines.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
that's
right.
the
area
rate
concept
is
that
it's
all
the
sellers.
but
i'm
still
not
certain
that
this
court
is
going
to
say
to
continental
or
anybody,
if
it
cost
you
30
cents
to
produce
gas
that
you've
got
to
sell
it
at
15.
now
this
is
an
area
rate
concept
and
hasn't
yet
been
decided
by
this
court
but
the
point
here
is
that
its
still
a
--
its
still
the
seller's
costs
that
determines
the
rate
and
that
doesn't
help
united
gas
pipe
line
company
(inaudible).
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
be
making
exactly
the
same
argument
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
because
i
think
the
act
contemplates
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir.
if
its
--
it's
quite
meaningless
in
this
sense
and
we
think
the
natural
-
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
would
certainly
take
it
to
that
extreme
and
here
is
why
sir.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
congress
contemplated.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
it
contemplate
it
when
you
left
out
of
the
natural
gas
act.
not
only
the
provision
that
the
commission
could
require
purchasing
but
it
left
out
all
that
structure
of
the
act
that
would
go
along
with
protecting
the
purchaser
forced
to
buy
gas
and
forced
to
pay
a
price
to
which
it
hasn't
agreed.
it
wouldn't
leave
to
the
--
the
purchasers
such
as
united
and
the
position
where
the
only
way
it
can
sell
gas
is
by
contract.
but
it
would
--
given
the
commission
power
to
say
either
that
continental
rates
got
to
be
reduced
or
that
united's
contract
rates
can
be
increased
but
the
commission
doesn't
have
that
power
sir.
and
i
think
that's
--
i
think
congress
made
that
decision
deliberately
because
it
viewed
the
matter
in
this
respect
that
natural
gas
companies
while
they'
were
going
to
be
regulating,
still
they
were
subject
to
competition.
the
natural
gas
act
even
leaves
completely
unregulated
--
about
half
the
gas
it
sold
into
state
commerce
at
least
for
this
company
and
that
is
gas
sold
directly
to
industries.
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
those
but
nevertheless,
they're
telling
us
that
we
must
pay
continental's
unilateral
rate
for
gas
that
we
take
and
sell
to
industries.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir,
first
of
all,
they
can
apply
it
to
the
commission
for
an
abandonment
that
that
is
to
abandon
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
for
an
abandonment
that
is,
it
can
abandon
its
sale
to
us.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
abandon
its
sale,
the
certificate.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
they
could
do
whatever
they
could've
have
done
with
it
absent
the
act.
they
could
sell
it
to
somebody
else.
there
is
somebody
there's
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
trans
continental
gas
pipe
line
company
is
there.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
they're
purchasing
gas
in
the
same
field.
now
whether
or
not
they
want
it,
i
don't
know.
i
think
continental
tried
to
sell
it
to
them.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
if
it
--
if
there's
no
market
outlet
for
it,
the
natural
gas
act
--
and
i
think
this
is
important
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
either
remain
in
the
ground
or
if
its
common
purchase
statute
enacted
as
there
is
in
louisiana,
may
they
come
and
purchase
statute
could
be
used
to
compel
a
pipe
line
to
buy
it.
but
the
point
is,
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
accomplish
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it's
entirely
possible
that
if
there
are
other
wells
producing
that,
it
would
siphon
off
this
gas,
that's
right
sir.
but
united
has
also
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
it's
important
for
continental
to
sell
its
gas
and
it's
got
a
market.
we
offer
to
buy
it.
we
offer
to
buy
it
sir
on
the
same
basis
we've
been
buying.
we
offered
to
continue
the
status
quo
and
the
offer
remains
open.
the
argument
here
is
whether
or
not
we've
really
got
to
buy
--
got
to
pay
their
price
as
distinct
from
our
price.
and
if
it
--
if
it's
going
to
be
drained
your
honor
it's
because
they
choose
drainage
to
--
acceding
to
our
terms
in
the
contract
negotiation.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
absent
to
contract
agreement
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i'd
say
without
a
contract
agreement
as
between
continental
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
they
would
have
no
jurisdiction
on
that.
no
sir.
no
more
than
they
would
have
over
this
your
honor.
there
may
be
other
producers
in
that
field
who
have
gas
that
they
want
to
sell.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
congress
could
enact
such
a
law.
congress
turned
down
such
a
law.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
it
was
not
and
congress
turned
down
an
act
that
would
have
taken
care
of
the
situations
you're
talking
about
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that
was
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
it
means
this,
that
congress
considered
this
senate
resolution
1919
that
would've
made
the
pipe
line
a
common
purchaser
and
it
turned
it
down
and
it
adopted
instead
this
more
limited
act
which
contemplates
a
gas
will
be
both
bought
and
sold
on
a
contractual
basis
and
really
it
would
--
says,
that
the
bargaining
between
the
seller
on
the
bar
insofar
as
contract
is
concern,
its
not
to
be
superseded
by
this
act.
now,
just
one
remaining
point
sir,
had
we
been
a
common
purchaser,
had
congress
adopted
the
act
that
made
us
a
common
purchaser,
they
would
require
us
to
have
bought
this
gas.
and
there's
no
doubt
about
it
as
the
senate
resolution
itself
concluded.
the
commission
itself
would've
had
authority
to
pass
on
through
our
rates
these
increased
costs
that
they
are
forcing
on
us.
but
this
commission
doesn't
have
that
authority
under
this
act.
it
cannot
increase
our
rates
above
those
to
which
our
costumers
has
contractually
agreed.
and
it's
just
because
of
the
fact
that
we
are
being
forced
to
pay
prices
that
we
can't
recover.
that
we
are
being
loaded
with
costs
that
we
can't
pass
on.
and
the
commission
can't
pass
on
for
us.
that
be
his
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
it
has
filed
a
price,
yes
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
has
been
accepted
by
the
commission
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
continental
could
follow,
that's
the
rate.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
think
the
filed
rate
is
the
rate
they
must
charge
if
we
buy,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
black,
the
real
controversy
in
this
case
is
whether
we
can
be
forced
to
buy
a
gas
and
pay
a
price
fixed
unilaterally
by
the
seller
and
that's
the
controversy.
we
take
the
position
and
we
really
can't
stay
in
business
if
we
are
faced
to
that
prospect.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
price
is
fixed
by
continental
of
15.75
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that's
right.
now,
the
commission
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
the
point
is
that
the
commission
can
review
it
of
course.
but
it
reviews
from
continental's
needs.
now,
the
question
has
been
asked
whether
we
could
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
they
review
it
by
the
producer's
needs
if
that's
the
new
concept
but
still
it's
not
the
pipe
line's
needs.
in
other
words,
the
15.75
cents
is
what's
required
to
permit
the
producer
to
make
a
fair
return
in
his
investment.
all
the
producers
has
a
group,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
what
we
make,
the
pipe
line.
now,
the
answer
to
this
question
about
whether
we
can
get
yes,
cheaper
or
not;
there's
been
a
lot
of
conjecture
but
the
answer
is
we
can
and
if
we
--
as
act
after
congress
intended
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
we
can
get
it
cheaper
other
than
this.
we
can
get
a
cheaper
then
they
can
eventually
raise
these
prices
unilateral
and
we
can
bargain
with
continental,
we
can
probably
get
a
cheap
in
15.75
cents.
the
point
is
that
congress
intended
that
we
buy
gas
on
contract
and
we
sell
it
on
contract
and
if
we
are
left
to
our
bargaining
position
we
can
protect
ourselves
in
the
public.
now,
we
are
trying
to
get
its
continental.
we're
competing
with
these
people
but
in
markets
in
south
louisiana
and
south
texas,
they
can
take
that
gas
that
they
say
to
us,
you've
got
to
pay
15.75
cents
and
they
can
sell
it
to
the
city
of
like
charles
or
somebody
of
14
cents
but
we
can't
necessarily
prove
it
except
we
can
see
the
end-result
and
where
the
companies
got
to
deal
with
that.
we've
got
to
protect
ourselves
and
we've
got
to
protect
the
public
and
we
can
a
buy
gas
cheaper
in
intrastate
market
than
we
can
buy
in
interstate
market
than
they
will
sell
it
cheaper
and
it
can
be
both
cheaper
and
after
our
bargaining
strength
we
can
buy
a
cheaper.
not,
not
only
applies
in
this
case,
it
applies
to
us
all
across
south
louisiana
because
everyone
of
our
gas
contract
is
going
to
expire
down
there.
and
if
ever
producer
can
tell
us,
you
got
to
pay
the
maximum
price
the
commission
will
allow
now
and
in
future
and
we're
down
to
business.
and
mr.
black
and
mr.
justice
black
sir,
that's
a
controversy.
there's
nothing
that
that
commission
can
do
to
protect
us.
we
sell
our
gas
to
be
in,
we
sell
46%
of
our
gas,
the
record
is
in
--
the
commission
can't
do
anything
about
that,
it's
completely
beyond
jurisdiction.
they
can't
affect
those
rates.
they
can't
help
us
in
any
respect.
we
sell
that
gas,
we
fix
the
price
with
the
industry
and
if
we
sell
a
gas
at
16
cents,
we've
got
to
buy
it
about
12
cents
or
13
cents
and
we
have
got
the
bargaining
strength
that
we
have
all
through
the
history
of
this
natural
gas
act,
we
can
buy
it
that
way
by
a
particular
sale.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
you
mean,
why
can
we?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
for
the
very
good
reason
sir,
i
think
i'm
conjectured
as
to
why
the
producers
will
sell
it
cheaper.
it
avoids
a
great
deal
of
red
tape
in
government
regulation.
there's
no
regulation
that
reduce
the
price
intrastate.
he
just
sell
it
us
over
a
contract
and
the
day
the
contract
expires,
his
gas
again
and
he
will
sell
a
cheaper
because
of
that
fact.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
i
don't
know
but
i'm
saying
that
left
up
to
us.
left
up
to
us,
we
can
keep
it
from
a
down
and
we
can
protect
ourselves
and
we
can
protect
the
public.
this
is
the
public's
interest
we're
protecting
here
and
to
conclude
my
argument,
mr.
justice
white,
congress
considered
doing
what
you
were
talking
about
and
that
is
making
pipe
lines
common
carriers
and
common
purchasers.
it
did
so
in
the
senate
resolution
1919
and
it's
federal
resolution
we
referred
to
and
it
refused
to
do
so,
it
didn't
adopt
it.
now,
the
effect
to
that
would've
have
been
done
what
you're
talking
about
that
is
to
make
us
buy
and
the
transport
but
had
it
done
so,
sir?
had
it
done
so,
it
would
given
the
commission
a
power
the
commission
doesn't
have
and
that's
the
power
it's
been
talked
about
in
common
purchasers
statutes
before
this
court
and
that
is
the
regulatory
commission
would
had
the
authority
to
look
at
continental's
rate
with
reference
to
our
needs
and
with
reference
to
the
market
conditions
and
to
be
able
to
insure
that
their
price
is
long
enough
to
us
so
that
when
we
sold
it
that
we
would
make
a
fair
return
in
our
investment
and
our
facilities.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir,
that's
what
they're
saying.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
but
excuse
me.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no,
sir,
here's
the
issue
in
the
case
sir,
if
i
may,
if
you
may
excuse
me.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
where
the
commission
is
right
in
saying
that.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
alright,
so
then
it
comes
back
to
this
basic
proposition.
the
commission
is
saying
that
it
has
a
right
to
compel
us
to
purchase
gas
and
the
law
is
clear
that
it
does
not
have
that
right
to
compel
us
to
purchase
gas,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir,
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
that.
we
bought
some
gas
and
we
did
pay
some
more
money
for
it
but
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
we
did
it
under
a
circumstances
where
we
were
faced
with
a
producer
coming
to
us
and
saying,
it
isn't
--
it
wasn't
this
area,
it
was
in
part
to
the
east
but
it
came
to
us
and
said,
i'm
going
to
lose
my
well,
i
got
one
well
here,
will
you
buy
this
gas?"
well,
now
we've
lived
in
that
area
for
40
years
down
there
and
we
didn't
want
him
to
lose
his
well
and
we
did
buy
his
well.
it
didn't
go
in
this
whole
amount
of
area,
it
went
over
to
new
orleans
there
and
we
bought
the
gas
for
18
cents
but
it
was
not
substitute
for
this
gas
and
the
record
reflects
that
it
was.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
(voice
overlap).
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way
sir,
we
bought
the
gas
down
there
because
and
the
male
was
going
to
lose
his
well
and
it
took
18
--
i
mean
their
18
cents
to
go
and
rate
down
there
and
it
was
a
contractual
arrangement.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
that
was
a
rate
in
that
area
at
that
time
yes
sir
for
buying
gas
and
contractual
arrangement
and
we
bought
it
rather
than
seeing
those
as
well.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir
that
was
a
new
--
that
was
a
new
sale,
new
small
amount
of
gas
and
not
a
new
sale
i
think
you
could
get
at
that
time
about
20
cents
or
something
of
the
fpc
jurisdiction.
we
still
didn't
pay
the
maximum
price
the
fpc
would
allow
to
interstate.
our
buyers
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
no
sir,
we
had
not.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
sir?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
what
is
it?
it's
a
--
the
area
guideline
is
21
and
a
half,
isn't
that
if
when
you
got?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
21
of
course,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
this
is
old
gas
down
there.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
you
mean,
what
we're
paying
them?
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
we
were
paying
them
10.79
cents
per
mcf.
we
started
that
contract
11
or
12
years
ago,
(inaudible).
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
i
assume
they
would
take
our
position
that
of
course
-
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
suppose
to
me
they
have
said
this,
they
have
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
they
say
facilities
and
they
ought
to,
counsel
here
to
appreciate
talks
about
services,
maybe
the
commission
did
mention
service
somewhere
sir.
but
service
once
again,
be
it
facilities
or
service
that
still
doesn't
give
the
commission
power
they
just
otherwise
have.
and
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
mr.
justice
white
where
they
talked
about
facilities
or
service.
if
they
don't
have
power
to
force
us
to
purchasing
--
to
purchase
gas
then
they
don't
have
a
power
to
do
so.
it
just
simply
begs
the
question
to
say
well,
we
can
force
you
to
purchase
it
because
we
got
jurisdiction
of
your
billing
or
your
pipeline
or
something
of
that
nature.
the
days
going
to
come
when
our
pipelines
will
be
full
of
gas
because
of
the
perhaps
the
theory
in
production
or
something
and
they're
going
to
--
are
they
going
to
move
in
and
say
you've
got
to
go
out
and
buy
gas
some
place
to
philadelphia,
that's
read
of
the
question
and
you've
got
to
pay
the
price
that
we
tell
you.
we
don't
really
object
to
that
if
the
bills
amended
to
take
care
of
us
in
term
but
we
don't
think
it's
in
the
public
interest,
we
don't
think
congress
thought
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
sir.
may
i
explain
just
one
moment?
the
producer
is
an
absent
no
different
position
from
what
the
pipeline
or
any
other
utility
had
been
in
all
the
existence
of
utility
law.
once
a
pipeline
begins
to
serve
a
customer,
an
account
boarded
customer,
a
distributor,
he
can't
stop
serving
that
distributor.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
and
neither
can
the
producer
stop
serving
us
but
here's
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
sir.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
that
distributor
doesn't
have
to
buy
a
foot
of
gas
from
us,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
one
cent
for
that
gas
that
he
doesn't
contractually
agree
to
and
maybe
that's
the
whole
point
of
this
argument.
and
we're
in
the
same
position
that
distributor
yes.
we
are
the
bar
here
and
the
natural
gas
act
doesn't
compel
that
distributor
to
buy
one
foot
of
gas
from
us
or
to
pay
one
cent
for
it.
he
doesn't
contract
to
agree
to
and
if
the
fpc
increased
our
price,
he
doesn't
have
to
buy
if
he
doesn't
contract
to
agree
to
it.
the
fpc
has
said,
it
can't
force
the
distributor
to
buy
gas
from
us
and
it
can.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir
they
have
protection.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
they
can
go
to
the
commission
and
say,
is
they
did
in
rutherford
case.
this
company
won't
buy
a
gas
from
us
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
well,
sir
i
accepted
under
my
in
the
deal
when
i
sell
the
distributor.
the
point
is
that
the
act
regulates
the
sale
and
it
was
intended
to
continue
the
sale
of
gas.
it
never
was
intended
to
force
the
purchasing
of
gas.
so
long
as
the
purchaser
owns
gas,
the
sellers
got
to
sell
it
but
he's
got
protection
sir.
he
can
file
unilaterally,
a
rate
is
fair
and
reasonable
from
his
point
of
view
and
we
can
do
it
when
we
sell
the
distributor.
we
have
lots
of
distributors
refuses
on
the
contract
with
these
ones
who
initiated
service
but
the
man
that
we
continue
service.
now,
we're
complaining
that
that
distributor
can't
be
force
to
buy
from
us.
we
don't
think
that's
an
equitable
regulation
and
we
don't
think
it's
inequitable
when
the
pipe
line
isn't
force
to
buy
up
and
the
seller
in
the
form
of
producer.
now,
the
act
might
have
been
written
differently.
we
might
have
been
made
it
common
carrier
or
common
purchaser
and
there
would
be
a
lot
of
remedies
to
us
under
the
act,
but
congress
didn't
arrive
that
way
sir.
congress
intended
to
do
one
thing
really
and
that's
to
regulate
the
sale
of
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
it
did
not
adopt
that
act
that
would
regulate
the
purchase
of
gas.
it
did
not
choose
to
make
us
common
purchasers
and
it
done
so
we've
been
entirely
different
act.
now,
this
been
about
getting
a
gas
to
the
market
and
about
protecting
the
continental
and
so
forth
in
these
circumstances,
it
may
well
be
the
common
purchase
allows
the
good
thing,
it
ought
to
be
adopted
by
congress.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
louisiana,
sir
has
a
common
purchaser
act
and
continental
maybe
in
the
wrong
court.
it
could
have
gone
to
the
court
such
as
louisiana
department
of
conservation
and
said,
i
want
to
exercise
my
rights
in
the
common
purchase
of
law
of
louisiana
and
i
want
you
to
force
united
to
buy
my
gas
that
had
been
done
so.
we
could've
told
continental.
we'll
give
you
to
go
in
to
your
rate
under
louisiana
law.
but
the
difference
is
that
the
natural
gas
act
is
not
a
common
purchase
of
law
and
that's
really
what's
this
whole
thing
is
about
and
if
it
were
written
to
common
purchase
of
law
and
if
we
had
the
protection
that
the
common
purchase
of
law
would
give
us,
then
we
wouldn't
be
here
complaining.
but
we
don't
have
that
protection
(voice
overlap).
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes,
sir.
and
we
have
to
protect
ourselves
and
we
protect
the
public.
we're
competing
with
this.
this
gentleman
right
here
for
the
same
market
in
that
area,
and
if
we
go
and
buy
this
gas
cheaper,
it
helps
us
in
the
public.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
yes
sir.
we
have
an
affiliate
that
produces
gas.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
we
have
an
affiliate
that
produces
gas
but
my
point
is
if
not
necessarily
continental,
there
are
numerous
producers
who
have
a
supply
of
gas
to
that
area
and
if
they
can
arrange
the
city
gate
or
with
the
big
initiate
to
buy
the
gas
they
will
build
a
pipeline
right
straight
up
for
that
city
gate
to
that
industry
and
they
were
selling
to
him
and
they're
going
to
sell
us,
while
they
--
at
the
same
able
to
tell
us
what
we
got
the
pay
for
gas.
now,
that's
a
problem
we
have
to
meet
and
so
that's
the
reason
we're
up
here
is
to
stay
in
this,
wherever
they
must.
now,
conceivably
we
can
have
alone
some
of
these
(inaudible),
we
can
absorb
some
of
these
cause
of
course.
the
fact
that
it
jump
from
10
to
15
cents
is
not
going
to
let
us
go
out
of
business,
but
all
of
our
contracts.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
what
did
they
say
to
us?
they
said,
--
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
they
said,
yes
exactly
what
mr.
schiff
has
said.
that
if
you
come
to
us
and
ask
us,
if
you
can
stop
this
purchase
and
our
position
is
that
we've
got
to
ask
you
we're
in
trouble
to
begin
with
but
there's
no
point
in
asking
but
the
law
doesn't
require
us
to
do
it
and
that's
really
what
we
are
arguing
about,
the
way
the
natural
gas
act
is
written.
now,
of
course
if
we've
got
to
ask
some
of
it,
if
it
turns
out
that
the
date
of
the
abandonment
of
facilities
means
that
they've
got
the
right
to
force
us
to
buy
gas
and
we'll
go
back
to
that
and
i
know
what
they're
going
to
say.
they're
going
to
say,
well,
please
go
and
absorb
that,
that's
not
much.
mr.
vernon
w.
woods
basically
absorb
this
increase
cost.it
doesn't
matter
that
you
got
fixed
contract
down
the
line
that
you
sell
to
end
user,
i
really
think
that's
what
they
would
say.
but
the
point
is,
sir,
they
don't
have
the
power
to
do
it.
they
don't
have
the
power
to
require
us
to
purchase
gas,
the
natural
gas
act
just
as
written
that
way.
