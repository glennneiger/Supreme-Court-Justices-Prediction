well
whatever

of
substantial
and
probative
evidence?
unknown
speaker
and
to
what
extent?
unknown
speaker
not
a
deportation
case?
unknown
speaker
in
this
identical
field/persons,
does
the
rowoldt
case
bear
on
this?
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
say
there?
unknown
speaker
and
who
must
determine
the
solidity?
unknown

but
that
would
still
put
in
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this,
as
a
predicate
to
asking
for
discretionary
relief,
must
he
admit
that
that
is
deportable?
unknown
speaker
you
may
deny
deportability
and
at
the
same
time
ask
for
discretion.
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
you’re
going
to
(inaudible)
to

i
have
the

(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
who
lays
it?
unknown
speaker
and
then
generally,
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
what
is
this
man
doing
now,
this
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
there
were
limitations
but
not
in
time?
unknown
speaker
where
in
the
attorney
general’s
regulations?
unknown
speaker
on
your
practice?
unknown
speaker
haven’t
we
had
cases
in
the
last
10,
15
years
coming
here
or
somewhere
in
the
federal
court,
the
deportations
were
civilians
who
participated
on
the
wrong
side
of

you
have
some
cases
involving

where
job
beware

or
–
unknown
speaker
or
disbarment
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
you
say
“discretionary”.
what
kind
of
texas
standard
were
on
that
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
that
means
if
he
wants
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
cannot
act
arbitrarily
but
he
find
it,
as
i
understand
as
what
you
mean
by
“discretion”.
he’s
got
the
rich
conclusion
from
he
thinks
as
the
why,
to
the
contrary.
he
is
the
man
here.
unknown
speaker
how
do
they
get
deserving?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
decides
he
is
not
deserving,
he
could
go
out.
unknown
speaker
if
he
had
been
going
out,
he
would
have
been
deported.
unknown
speaker
i
think
he
took
a
pretty
big
risk.
unknown
speaker
is
it
true
that
no
statute
that
applies
here,
to
what
this
petitioner
did?
unknown

what
statute

unknown
speaker
yes,
what
is

do
you
remember
if
it’s
three
years?

so
five

after
this

faked
the
passport
as
he
claimed
it
then,
four
or

he
could
have
been
prosecuted.
