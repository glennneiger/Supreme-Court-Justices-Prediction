why
is
that
mr.

justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
attempt
here
to
get
discretionary
relief?
justice
abe
fortas
it
has
to
be
admissible
as
you
read
it
as
of
the
time.
justice
abe
fortas
as
of
what
time?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
think
that's
the
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
standard
was
applied
here
at
the
administrative
level
as
no
indication
and
the
opinions
that
i've
read
as
i
recall
that
anytime
they
articulated
a
standard,
did
they?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
that
a
little
unusual
as
a
matter
of
legal
procedure?
ordinarily,
doesn't
a
prior
of
fact
have
some
sort
of
a
standard?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
a
question
as
to
whether
that
is
a
standard
for
the
prior
fact
or
the
standard
on
their
view
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
what
your
position
and
the
position
of
the
other
side
in
my
mind
that
this
moment
anywhere,
it
seems
to
be
a
debatable
point
how
you
read
the
statute
but
i'm
bothered
because
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
in
other
--
i
don't
recall
any
decisions
of
officers
at
the
administrative
level
in
deportation
cases.
i
don't
recall
encountering
a
statement
by
them
of
the
standard
that
they
use.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
probative.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
you're
referring
sir
--
you
referred
to
me
the
parole
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
that
in
your
brief.
did
you
say
that's
10
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
haven't
found
there
in
the
sherman
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
he
said,
it
was
untrue.
justice
abe
fortas
he
gave
a
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
then
that
made
sense,
don't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
--
you
refer
this
to
prerogative
and
as
quoted
in
the
petitioner's
brief
to
suspend,
it
says
that
or
they
extend
the
services
burden
as
declined
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
as
follows,
“ordinarily
in
deportation
proceedings,
the
service
must
establish
its
case
by
a
preponderance,
a
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence”
and
that's
essentially
a
civil
standard,
isn't
it?
especially
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
this
is
very
close
to
distinct
preponderance
of
the
evidence
rule
that
describes
some
kind
of
them,
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
in
the
dispute
as
to
whether
the
language
in
the
statute
is
addressed
to
the
administrative
officials
or
whether
it's
merely
and
exclusively
language
to
be
--
to
guide
the
courts
in
review.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
this
statement
from
peralta,
as
it
says,
ordinarily
in
deportation
proceedings,
do
you
know
whether
there
are
circumstances
in
which
service
uses
some
other
standard?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
it's
authorized
to
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
are
those
cases
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
charged
(voice
overlap)
is
it
charged
that
he
fraudulently
cheated
as
you
put
it
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
no,
let's
get
to
the
charge.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
that
he
--
and
that
means
that
he
entered
pretending
to
be
a
u.s.
citizen?
justice
abe
fortas
the
record
then
will
show
what
happened
here.
justice
abe
fortas
just
as
a
matter
of
interest
mr.
gordon,
how
did
it
happen
that
suddenly
25
years
after
the
alleged
event,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
of
which
you
were
a
deputy
general
counsel
have
gone
after
this
man?
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
sure
your
service
based
the
statutory's
limitations.
when
the
statute
provides
for
a
period
of
limitations,
is
there
any
administrative
period
of
limitations
that
the
service
has
adopted
in
effect
to
the
deportation
proceedings
of
any
kind?
