mr.
charles
gordon
may
it
please
the
court.
i
request
the
permission
of
the
court
for
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
of
the
ohio
bar
who
is
an
assistant
to
the
solicitor
general
to
argue
this
case
in
behalf
of
the
respondent.
mr.
charles
gordon
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
see
it,
the
issue
presented
by
this
petition
is
narrow
one.
it
is
not
disputed
here
that
the
statute
prescribes
for
deportation
for
entry
without
inspection
under
the
circumstances
depicted
here.
it
is
not
contended
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
any
reason.
moreover,
the
petitioner
does
not
claim
that
he
was
not
given
a
fair
hearing
nor
does
he
assert
that
there
was
any
deviation
from
due
process.
his
sole
contention
relates
to
the
adequacy
of
evidence
on
which
the
deportation
charge
was
reported.
now,
petitioner
relies
heavily
on
the
severity
of
the
consequences
of
deportation
particularly
for
long
time
residents.
with
that
premise,
all
of
us
will
agree.
what
we
do
take
issue
with,
however,
is
the
nature
of
the
structure
petitioner
seeks
to
place
upon
that
premise.
to
us,
the
decisive
consideration
here
is
this,
the
administrative
tribunal
found
unpersuasive
evidence
convincing
to
it
that
there
had
been
an
entry
without
inspection.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
that
decision
found
that
the
administrative
decision
was
reasonably
supported
by
probative
and
substantial
evidence.
we
believe
that
petitioner's
hypothesis
regarding
the
measure
of
persuasion
is
unrelated
to
the
realities
of
the
record
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
the
delay
in
the
number
of
years
is
more
seeming
than
real.
the
fact
is
that
the
petitioner
reentered
in
1938.
the
following
year,
world
war
ii
intervened
and
there
were
deportations.
after
the
end
of
world
war
ii,
there
was
a
period
in
which
the
conditions
have
not
been
stabilized.
then
information
came
to
us
that
there
were
a
number
of
people
like
petitioner
how
had
used
fraudulent
passports.
investigation
was
conducted.
the
investigation
took
many
years.
the
investigation
was
followed
by
efforts
to
subpoena
the
petitioner
and
other
witnesses,
they
resisted,
court
proceedings
followed,
and
eventually
they
were
required
to
answer
the
subpoena's,
eventually
we've
got
to
the
point
where
they
claimed
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
then
we
proceeded
on
the
other
evidence,
so
the
delay
isn't
as
long
as
it
appears,
we
were
trying
during
that
time
to
make
the
deportation
case.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
there
is
no
period
of
limitation
as
such.
however,
there
is
an
administrative
policy
of
compassion.
we
have
--
mr.
charles
gordon
there
are
no
years.
there
are
cases
in
which
it
is
our
conviction
that
the
consequences
of
deportation
are
excessively
severe
because
the
family
ties,
because
of
the
age
of
the
petitioner
and
because
of
other
considerations
urged.
in
those
cases,
we
do
not
press
for
deportation.
there
are
several
thousand
such
cases.
in
our
judgment,
this
was
not
such
a
case.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
moreover
your
honor
that
congress
has
provided
has
provided
avenues
for
relief
in
cases
of
this
kind.
there
are
a
number
of
discretionary
remedies
which
were
available
to
the
petitioner
and
during
the
hearing
he
was
asked,
“do
you
wish
to
apply
for
any
of
these
discretionary
remedies?”
he
said,
“i
am
going
to
think
about
it.
i'll
let
you
know
later
on.”
and
thereafter
he
thought
about
and
decided
not
to
apply.
well,
i
can't
probe
his
mind.
i
do
not
know
why
he
didn't
chose
to
apply,
and
that's
he
didn't
want
to
testify,
about
his
activities.
but
that's
speculations.
the
fact
is
that
there
were
opportunities
for
relief,
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
all
there
is
in
this
deportation,
entry
without
inspection.
there
is
no
other
charge
and
we
don't
claim
that
there's
any
other
deportation
charge
we
would
bring
against
them.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
we
haven't
pursued
this
one
man.
there
has
been
a
whole
group
of
individuals
like
this
and
we
we're
trying
to
make
a
case.
it
was
very
difficult
because
this
man
used
a
false
name
and
it
was
hard
to
connect
him
joe
sherman
with
sam
levine.
finally
we
did
assemble
the
evidence
and
we
proceeded
as
expeditiously
as
we
could.
mr.
charles
gordon
you
honor,
i
do
not
believe
we
have
deported
any
because
the
others
did
apply
for
discretionary
relief
and
were
granted
discretionary
relief.
we
gave
the
same
opportunity
to
this
petitioner.
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
he
must
make
an
application.
he
must
testify,
he
must
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
your
honor,
but
before
we
exercise
our
discretion,
we
would
want
to
know
what
type
of
individual
this
man
is,
what
he's
been
doing
and
whether
he's
deserving
a
discretion.
mr.
charles
gordon
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
should
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
of
this
time
outlining
the
evidence.
petitioner
has
chosen
to
concentrate
on
the
testimony
of
the
witness
edward
morrow.
this
is
only
a
portion
of
the
record.
if
that
was
the
only
evidence,
it
would
concededly
be
inadequate.
but
petitioner
has
conveniently
grossed
over
some
very
important
elements
of
the
record
which
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
under
any
criteria.
in
totality,
we
believe
the
evidence
on
the
record
in
this
case
would
most
likely
satisfy
any
criterion
of
persuasion.
the
evidence
is
summarized
for
the
court’s
information,
that’s
pages
2
to
6
of
our
brief.
briefly,
it
is
as
follows.
first,
there
is
a
united
states
passport
which
was
issued
to
one
samuel
levine
in
june
of
1937.
now,
thoughout
the
proceedings,
petitioner
has
not
denied,
and
yesterday
i
heard
his
counsel
conceived
that
petitioner’s
photograph
appears
on
this
passport.
a
witness,
samuel
robinski
was
called
and
he
said,
“yes,
i’m
a
friend
of
petitioner.
that
is
his
photograph
on
the
passport.
petitioner
asked
me
to
go
with
him
to
the
passport
office
and
to
appear
as
a
witness
on
his
unidentified
witness
on
his
behalf”
and
he
said,
“i
signed
my
name
‘robinski’
to
that
passport
and
that’s
petitioner’s
photograph
on
the
passport”.
moreover,
the
identifying
data
on
the
passport
correspond
with
petitioner’s
identification.
for
example,
he
has
a
scar
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand.
at
the
hearing,
he
was
asked
to
show
his
hand,
has
a
scar
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand.
the
passport
shows
a
scar
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand.
next,
there
are
documents
which
include
notations
on
the
passport
itself
which
show
that
this
passport
was
used.
first,
there
is
a
visa
by
the
french
consul
general
in
new
york;
couple
of
days
after
the
issuance
of
the
passport,
a
visa
for
the
holder
of
the
passport
to
go
to
france.
then
there
was
a
notation
on
the
passport
that
the
holder
of
the
passport
was
admitted
by
the
immigration
authorities
in
france,
a
couple
of
days
--
a
few
days
later
when
the
boat
ducked.
then,
there
is
a
notation
on
the
passport
that
in
december
of
1938,
the
holder
of
that
passport
again
used
it.
he
presented
that
to
the
american
consular
authorities
in
barcelona
and
asked
them
to
approve
it
for
his
coming
to
the
united
states.
then,
there
are
document,
additional
documents,
the
american
consulate
in
france
show
that
a
number
of
persons
had
arrived
in
france
and
these
were
expected
to
being
persons
who
were
using
that
passport
to
spain.
among
them
is
less
than
the
name
of
samuel
levine
and,
finally,
on
the
passport
itself
there
was
a
stamp
by
the
immigration
service,
showing
that
the
holder
of
this
passport,
samuel
levine,
was
admitted
to
the
united
states
under
that
name
in
december
of
1938.
now,
we
add
to
that
the
testimony
of
witness
morrow.
this
is
cumulative.
this
is
supporting
evidence.
this
in
itself,
is
i
say
is
not
enough.
but
added
to
the
other
evidence,
it
is
quite
impressive.
now
something
about
mr.
morrow,
this,
as
the
court
indicated
and
counsel
agreed
yesterday,
this
is
not
a
professional
witness.
this
is
a
reporter
for
the
new
york
times,
a
man
who
was
worth
as
his
report
for
over
20
years.
he
himself
pored
in
spain
and
we
located
him
after
some
diligent
gun
showing.
we
found
out
that
this
person
had
been
in
spain.
we
asked
him,
“do
you
remember
this
person?”
we
showed
this
photograph.
well,
he
said,
“i
can’t
say
i
do.
that
photograph
is
vaguely
familiar
to
me.
i
can’t
say
i
don’t”.
“do
you
remember
the
name
‘sam
or
samuel
levine?”
“that
rings
a
bell
on
my
mind
but
i
can’t
say.
i
think
there
was
some
such
fellow
but
i
can’t
say.
he
was
asked,
“would
you
want
to
look
at
the
person
we
have
in
mind
and
see
if
that
will
refresh
your
recollection?”
he
said,
“i’d
be
glad
to”.
so
in
one
day
when
there
was
a
hearing,
unknown
to
the
petitioner,
mr.
morrow
this
non-professional
public
expert
individual,
“this
is
the
only
interest,
who
has
been
telling
the
truth”,
he
said,
went
to
the
immigration
office
and
sat
down
there
in
the
lobby
and
observed
the
petitioner.
and
after
this
observation
for
now,
“yes”,
he
said
“i
remember
now.
this
is
the
sam
levine
that
served
with
me
in
the
spanish
loyalist
forces
in
spain”.
he
says,
“i
remember
it
too
that
he
went
back
with
me
on
the
s.s.
ausonia,
with
the
group
of
his
--
who
sailed
from
spain
back
to
the
united
states
as
the
loyalist
were
losing
the
war
in
1938.
and,
i
remember
he
was
on
the
ship
at
that
time”.
now
i
suggest
that
on
the
face
of
this
record,
the
petitioner’s
failure
to
offer
any
of
these,
none
at
all.
he
didn’t
testify,
he
didn’t
produce
any
witnesses,
could’ve
produced
document
possibly,
he
could’ve
produced
witness.
he
said
nothing;
he
testified
to
nothing.
he
just
sat
there
and
did
not
open
his
mouth.
now,
he
is
the
person
who
knew
the
facts;
he
is
the
person
that
best
knew
the
facts.
and,
added
to
this
record
and
on
the
face
of
this
record,
i
think
his
silence
is
also
significant.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
said,
“it
is
vaguely
familiar
to
me”.
mr.
charles
gordon
that’s
all
he
said.
he
was
a
careful
witness.
he
didn’t
want
to
comment
so.
mr.
charles
gordon
as
i
recall,
it
was
about
four
months.
mr.
charles
gordon
over
25
years.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think,
sir,
that
this
is
a
normal
reaction
that
the
person’s
recollection
can’t
be
refreshed
as
he
thinks
about
the
incidents,
as
he
thinks
of
the
events.
and
as
he
sees
the
individual,
his
memory
can
be
refreshed.
to
me,
this
seems
like
the
reaction
of
a
very
honest
and
a
very
sincere
witness.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
think,
perhaps
it
might
have
been
enough.
i
would
want
to
state
--
mr.
charles
gordon
because
there
was
a
witness,
mr.
robinski,
who
is
a
friend
of
the
petitioners
who
said,
“i
went
with
him
to
the
passport
office
and
he
asked
me
to
be
an
identified
witness”.
that
is
his
photograph
on
the
passport
and
that,
together
with
the
showing
that
the
passport
was
used
presumably
by
the
same
individual,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
might
be
enough.
but
if
you
add
to
it
the
testimony
of
witness
morrow
and
add
to
it
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
refused
to
give
any
evidence,
it
seems
to
be
this
is
a
pretty
good
case
by
any
criterion.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
it
would
satisfy
any
text.
frankly,
i
think
it
would
satisfy
beyond
–
mr.
charles
gordon
it
seems
to
me
it
would.
this
is
only
a
matter
of
opinion
but
it
seems
to
me
what
we
have
here
is
an
overwhelming
showing
that
an
individual
who
wants
the
petitioner
obtain
this
passport
and
the
passport
says,
“i
intend
to
use
it
within
the
few
days”.
the
application
says.
and,
the
showing
is
that
the
individual
obtained
this
passport,
went
to
france
with
his
picture
on
it,
mind
you,
this
identifying
data.
everytime
that
passport
is
presented,
somebody
looks
at
it,
compares
the
picture
with
the
person
who
present
the
passport
and
that
passport
obtained
by
the
petitioner
was
used
in
going
to
france
and
in
returning
from
spain
in
1938.
it
seems
to
me
that’s
pretty
overwhelming
evidence.
at
least,
the
factfinder
(voice
overlap)
so.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
and
it
shows
it,
the
court
of
appeals
just
wrongly
understand
it
then
i
think,
your
honor,
might
wish
to
remand
it.
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
right,
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
very
clear
from
the
opinion
of
judge
friendly
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
and
i
agree
that
the
only
standard
applicable
to
this
case
is
the
one
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
not.
these
terms
are
apparent
to
the
administrative
procedure.
what
congress
had
in
mind
here
was
an
assessment
of
facts
by
experts,
by
people
who
were
trained
to
assess
the
fact
and
who
didn’t
need
the
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
it’s
something
different,
your
honor.
i
think
all
the
statute
–
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor
–
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
i
don’t
agree.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
friendly
said
that
“the
standard
of
reasonable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence
which
are
set
forth
in
the
two
places
of
the
statute
applies
to
the
factfinder,
it
applies
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
two
different
test.
if
i
could,
i
would
try
to
stay
clear
of
preponderance
because
it
has
no
bearing
yet.
there
is
–
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
so;
it
has
been
used
in
isolated
cases.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
was
not
used
in
this
one.
that
is
not
so,
your
honor.
there
was
no
suggestion
here
of
any
preponderance
because
it’s
not
relevant
to
this
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
think
it’s
hide
in,
your
honor;
i
agree.
our
view
is
that
the
statute
was
saying
this
“that
in
order
to
make
a
determination,
the
factfinder
must
be
persuaded”.
and
i
don’t
care
if
you
call
it
preponderance
or
convincing
–-
mr.
charles
gordon
and
conviction
on
the
part
of
the
fact-finder.
am
i
convinced
of
the
truth
of
these
charges?
now
was
the
factfinder
is
convinced
of
the
truth
of
these
charges?
he
makes
a
determination.
and
the
only
issue
then
under
the
statute
and
under
the
criteria
which
have
been
applied
by
this
court
is,
was
that
determination
based
on
substantial
evidence
or
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence
as
the
statute
says.
that,
as
this
court
has
set,
means
that
could
the
factfinder
--
could
a
reasonable
mind
sitting
in
the
place
of
the
factfinder
have
come
to
the
same
determination?
mr.
charles
gordon
the
standard
is
that
what
you’re
talking
about
the
standard
of
evidence?
mr.
charles
gordon
the
burden
of
proof
unquestionably
is
on
the
government
to
establish
--
mr.
charles
gordon
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
person
is
an
alien;
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
is
deportable.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
told
to
us
by
the
statute.
it
says
so
specifically.
section
242
(b)
says,
“no
decision
of
deportability
shall
be
valid
unless
it
is
based
on
reasonable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence.”
to
me,
that
means
–
mr.
charles
gordon
burden
of
proof?
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
always
been
conceded,
your
honor,
and
it
is
always
been
stated
by
this
court
and
agreed
to
by
the
government
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
it’s
not
talking
about
the
schneiderman
case.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
weight?
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
those
to
me
our
terms
which
were
developed
by
courts
and
are
relevant
in
court
proceedings.
here
we
have
a
factfinder,
an
administrative
also
who
was
trained
to
make
determinations.
he
must
act
on
conviction.
he
must
be
persuaded.
mr.
charles
gordon
by
substantial
evidence;
that
is
the
statutory
criterion.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
this
is
–
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
in
the
terms
of
this
case
is
not
relevant
because
there
is
no
question
of
balancing
evidence
here.
there’s
only
evidence
presented
by
the
government.
the
respondent
presented
no
proof.
mr.
charles
gordon
exactly!
the
question
is,
does
the
factfinder
believe
this
evidence.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
believes
it
and
that
the
evidences
–
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
the
statute
goes
further.
it
says
that
the
evidence
must
be
reasonable.
as
we
translate
it,
he
must
be
reasonably
persuaded
by
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
congress
took
pains
to
say
that
this
was
the
standard
on
which
the
factfinder
must
act.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
that
“deportation”
--sec.
242
(b),
which
is
set
forth
in
full
at
page
33
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix.
it
says,
“that
deportation
procedure
shall
be
in
accordance
with
regulations
which
are
prescribed
by
the
attorney
general
and
includes
a
listing
of
four
specific
safeguards,
including
that
the
decision
must
be
based
on
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence”.
and
that
it
goes
on
to
say
that
“the
procedure
so
prescribe
shall
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
procedure
for
determining
deportability”.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
here
reposed
in
the
attorney
general
the
responsibility
not
only
for
conducting
the
hearings
but
for
fashioning
the
procedure
under
which
the
hearings
were
to
be
conducted.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
completely,
your
honor,
because
the
attorney
general
must
bear
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
individual
was
an
alien
and
that
he
is
deportable.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i
suggest
one
additional
fact
which
you
might
wish
to
taken
into
account.
the
administrate
--
the
deportation
process
has
always
been
administrative.
this
has
never
been
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
charles
gordon
you’re
right.
and
it
is
a
procedure
which
must
be
fashioned
with
care
and
it
is.
the
statute
spells
out
in
great
details
the
rules,
the
procedures,
the
safeguards
which
shall
be
applicable
in
those
cases.
and
this
court
sets,
in
addition
to
those
rules,
to
assure
that
due
process
is
observed.
now,
the
function
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
and
i
submit
respectfully,
is
not
to
fashion
rules
for
administrative
proceedings
–
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor
–-
mr.
charles
gordon
i
agree
that
it
is
a
very
serious
responsibility
in
the
attorney
general
in
charged
with
regard
to
the
--
as
a
serious
responsibility.
but
congress
has
spoken.
now
if
congress
has
no
authority,
then
this
court
comes
into
this
picture.
but
there’s
no
contention
to
hear
that
congress
has
no
authority.
the
only
contention
here
is
that
congress
has
not
spoken.
therefore,
the
court
has
authority.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
a
complete
non-executive.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
power
to
fashion
rules,
the
power
to
fashion
procedures
is
an
administrative
power
and
that
the
only
time
this
court
comes
in
to
the
picture
is
if
there’s
a
violation
of
due
process.
that’s
not
charged
here
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
the
case
in
which
the
court
shall
--
can
be
asked
to
fashion
rules.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
this
court,
your
honor,
but
other
courts
have.
mr.
charles
gordon
let
me
lend
my
statement,
your
honor.
this
court
in
many
cases
has
stated
that
it
is
not
concerned
with
the
weight
of
the
evidence
with
the
--
whether
the
decision
of
the
factfinder
is
right,
with
whether
admissible
evidence
was
received.
the
only
concern,
and
this
is
stated
in
case
after
case,
the
only
concern
of
this
court
or
of
any
court
in
relation
to
the
findings
of
fact,
is
to
determine
whether
in
the
old
language
of
the
old
case
whether
there
was
any
evidence.
and,
under
the
more
recent
criteria,
the
only
concern
of
the
court
has
been,
as
stated
by
this
court
and
other
courts,
to
determine
whether
there
is
reasonable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence.
this
is
stated
in
case
after
case.
now,
as
the
substantial
evidence,
there
had
been
lower
court
decisions,
again
i
amend
my
statement,
i
recall
something
else.
this
court
has
said
in
the
consolidated
edison
case
that
substantial
evidence
–-
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir,
an
administrative
case
of
the
labor
board.
the
terms
of
the
(inaudible),
they
used
throughout
administrative
laws.
they
used
in
the
administrative
procedure
and
the
language
is
very
similar
to
this.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
the
court
said
that
through
mr.
justice
frankfurther
that
“we
must
take
into
account
the
solidity
of
proof”
-
that
was
the
language
–
“which
is
necessary
to
deport
a
long
time
resident”.
i
translate
that
to
mean
we
must
take
into
account
the
substantiality
of
the
evidence.
and
to
me
the
term,
“substantiality
of
the
evidence”
is
an
extensive
one.
i
say
that
circumstance
is
different
and
at
least
plenty
of
room
to
determine
how
much
evidence,
how
solid
the
evidence
must
be
in
the
case
of
a
long
time
resident.
i
can
see
that
it
must
be
solid
indeed.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
the
first
place,
the
administrative
factfinder;
in
the
second
place,
the
reviewing
court.
your
honor,
as
i
see
the
statute,
the
reference
to
substantial
evidence
or
reasonable
probative
as
substantial
evidence
is
two-fold,
one
reference
in
242
(b),
that
is
addressed
to
the
factfinder
and
tells
him
he
must
act
on
reasonable
and
probative
and
substantial
evidence;
and
the
other
is
in
section
106
(a)
-
that’s
addressed
to
the
reviewing
court
and
tell
us
there
that
the
administrative
factfinding
is
conclusive
if
it
is
based
on
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
alright,
i
see
my
time
is
running
and
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
something
that
was
discussed
yesterday.
i
think
the
court
is
very
much
interested
and
that
is
the
question
of
discretionary
relief.
we
had
some
discussion
yesterday
about
the
possibilities
of
discretionary
relief
and
i
pointed
out
that
the
opportunity
to
apply
for
such
relief
was
given
to
the
petitioner
that
his
counsel
said
at
the
hearing,
“i’d
like
sometime
to
think
about
it”
and
at
the
end
of
the
period
which
is
allotted
to
him,
he
did
not
apply
for
discretionary
relief.
now,
we
agree
that
this
is
a
statute
with
severe
consequences.
but
congress
has
made
allowance
in
many
ways
for
alleviating
those
consequences.
now,
if
this
applicant
had
been
sincerely
desirous
of
applying
for
relief,
there
were
many
obnoxious
relief
opened
him
and
there
were
mentioned
at
the
deportation
hearing.
he
was
told,
“there
are
various
types
of
a
relief
for
which
you
can
apply”.
there
is,
for
example,
and
this
was
matches
the
hearing,
section
243
(h).
you
may
wish
to
claim
that
you’d
be
physically
persecuted
if
you
would
deported
to
poland.
there
is
section
249
which
deals
with
specifically
with
this
type
of
case.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir.
it
would
permit
him
to
remain;
some
of
these
would
permit
him
to
remain
as
permanent
resident.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir,
and
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
your
honor
mentioned
that
yesterday
and
he
was
not
told
anything
about
it
and
i
want
it
indicate
that
this
is
still
available.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
can
dispute
deportability.
that
is
exactly
what
our
regulation
say
and
ask
for
relief
at
the
same
time
conditionally.
mr.
charles
gordon
our
regulations
provide
that
exactly
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
gordon
it’s
hcf
arm.
242.17
(d),
if
i
recall
it
correctly.
it’s
242,
17
u.c.
or
d;
i
think
d.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
says
that
a
person
who
applies
for
discretionary
relief
does
not
thereby
conceive
deportability.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
it
is
the
regulation
now.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
he
never
applied
for
the
relief.
we
don’t
know
whether
it
is
available
then
but
he
seems
technically
within
the
context
of
that
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
sir.
he
is
illegible
but
he
has
to
show
that
he
is
otherwise
admissible.
now
that
might
entail
some
difficulties
but
i
don’t
see
what
would
the
difficulties
are.
mr.
charles
gordon
if
he
was
otherwise
admissible,
the
statute
ways
that
we
don’t
have
anything
to
do.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
has
a
--
as
far
as
we
know,
we
don’t,
your
honor.
you
see
he
didn’t
testify.
but
counsel
says
he
has
an
american
citizen
waiver.
if
he
would
to
tell
us
this,
and
that
of
course
would
put
him
within
the
statute,
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
automatic
waiver
if
he
is
otherwise
admissible.
now,
the
only
thing
i
can
see
about
the
otherwise
admissible
part
is
that
when
he
returned,
he
didn’t
have
a
proper
visa.
but
there
is
a
specific
provision
for
waiting
that
ineligibility;
that’s
section
211
(b).
mr.
charles
gordon
the
attorney
general.
mr.
charles
gordon
oh,
the
attorney
general
has
many
discretionary
powers,
your
honor,
and
exercised
them
very
freely.
there
are
many
way
of
deportability.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
this
remains
a
mystery
but
yesterday,
counsel
said
that
he
is
a
construction
worker.
i
myself
did
not
know
what
he
did.
at
one
point,
a
hearing
or
in
a
statement
that
he
gave,
he
said
he
was
a
taxi
driver.
but
i
don’t
know
what
he
was
doing
now.
we
don’t
know
much
about
this
individual
because
he
has
never
told
us
anything.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
those
investigations
have
limitations.
we
can’t
tell
exactly
what
the
individual
was
doing.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
there
was
no
limitation
in
time
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
gordon
nothing
in
the
regulations
but
as
i
told
you
–
mr.
charles
gordon
in
practice,
we
do
have
a
policy
of
not
bringing
proceedings
in
cases
of
excess
deportship
and,
if
your
honor,
this
information
i
should
tell
there
are
about
2,000
such
cases
where
deportation
proceedings
–
mr.
charles
gordon
none
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
no
deportation
cases.
mr.
charles
gordon
i’m
not
even
familiar
–
mr.
charles
gordon
it
could
be,
your
honor,
but
i’m
not
familiar
with
those
cases.
this
is
the
only
case
--
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
bench
yesterday,
i
believe
with
mr.
justice
black.
i
informed
the
court
that
there
had
been
a
number
of
people
like
this
who
had
resorted
to
forge
passport.
and
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
we
were
able
to
give
them
relief.
we
did
not
deport
a
single
one
of
them
because
they
applied
for
relief.
we
found
that
they
were
worthy
of
relief
and
we
granted
the
relief.
now,
there
has
not
been
any
individual
who
has
been
deported
on
the
similar
circumstance
and
i
suspect
that
if
this
petitioner
was
to
apply
for
relief,
it’s
quite
possible
that
he
would
obtain
the
relief.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
his
counsel,
i
would
not
have
told
this
special
inquiry
officer,
who
gave
him
this
opportunity.
special
inquiry
officer
said,
“i’d
be
glad
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
apply
for
discretionary
relief”.
he
said,
“well,
let
me
think
about
it”.
this
is
counsel
speaking,
“let
me
think
about
it
for
a
couple
of
weeks”.
he
thought
about
it
special
inquiry
officer
to
mention
the
whole
series
of
statute
under
which
he
could
apply
for
relief.
and
after
thinking
about
it,
he
did
not
apply
for
any
discretionary
relief.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
the
statute
said
that
in
certain
circumstances,
the
attorney
general,
in
his
discretion.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir.
he
cannot
act
arbitrarily.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i’m
not
wise
to
the
contrary.
whether
the
person
is
deserving
really
is
more
accurate.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
this
is
what
congress
has
done
it.
it’s
made
a
–
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
in
the
first
place,
he
must
be
deported.
they
were
targeting
about
aliens
who
went
to
the
terms
of
the
statute
are
deportable.
then
the
statute
says,
“even
though
congress
has
said
these
individuals
are
deportable,
yet
we
will
provide
a
wide
area
in
which
the
attorney
general
can
grant
relief.
and
many
of
these
types
of
remedies
which
congress
has
provided
apply
directly
to
this
petitioner,
a
long
time
resident
for
example.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
right,
but
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
go
out,
your
honor.
he
took
the
risk.
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
make
false
statement
–-
mr.
charles
gordon
i
would
assume
so.
person
who
goes
out
of
the
country
for
19
months,
as
this
individual
did,
and
chooses
to
fight
the
farn
army.
however,
laudable
that
may
be
from
his
stand
point,
yet
he
knows
he
is
violating
the
law.
he
knows
that
he
is
taking
a
risk
if
he
comes
back.
he
knows
–
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
it’s
long
since
passed.
mr.
charles
gordon
my
recollection
is
five
but
i
wouldn’t
conceive
the
three
of
five.
mr.
charles
gordon
that’s
true,
your
honor,
but
he
was
not.
we
didn't
know,
now
of
course,
the
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
gordon
may
it
please
the
court.
i
request
the
permission
of
the
court
for
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
of
the
ohio
bar
who
is
an
assistant
to
the
solicitor
general
to
argue
this
case
in
behalf
of
the
respondent.
mr.
charles
gordon
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
see
it,
the
issue
presented
by
this
petition
is
narrow
one.
it
is
not
disputed
here
that
the
statute
prescribes
for
deportation
for
entry
without
inspection
under
the
circumstances
depicted
here.
it
is
not
contended
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
any
reason.
moreover,
the
petitioner
does
not
claim
that
he
was
not
given
a
fair
hearing
nor
does
he
assert
that
there
was
any
deviation
from
due
process.
his
sole
contention
relates
to
the
adequacy
of
evidence
on
which
the
deportation
charge
was
reported.
now,
petitioner
relies
heavily
on
the
severity
of
the
consequences
of
deportation
particularly
for
long
time
residents.
with
that
premise,
all
of
us
will
agree.
what
we
do
take
issue
with,
however,
is
the
nature
of
the
structure
petitioner
seeks
to
place
upon
that
premise.
to
us,
the
decisive
consideration
here
is
this,
the
administrative
tribunal
found
unpersuasive
evidence
convincing
to
it
that
there
had
been
an
entry
without
inspection.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
that
decision
found
that
the
administrative
decision
was
reasonably
supported
by
probative
and
substantial
evidence.
we
believe
that
petitioner's
hypothesis
regarding
the
measure
of
persuasion
is
unrelated
to
the
realities
of
the
record
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
the
delay
in
the
number
of
years
is
more
seeming
than
real.
the
fact
is
that
the
petitioner
reentered
in
1938.
the
following
year,
world
war
ii
intervened
and
there
were
deportations.
after
the
end
of
world
war
ii,
there
was
a
period
in
which
the
conditions
have
not
been
stabilized.
then
information
came
to
us
that
there
were
a
number
of
people
like
petitioner
how
had
used
fraudulent
passports.
investigation
was
conducted.
the
investigation
took
many
years.
the
investigation
was
followed
by
efforts
to
subpoena
the
petitioner
and
other
witnesses,
they
resisted,
court
proceedings
followed,
and
eventually
they
were
required
to
answer
the
subpoena's,
eventually
we've
got
to
the
point
where
they
claimed
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
then
we
proceeded
on
the
other
evidence,
so
the
delay
isn't
as
long
as
it
appears,
we
were
trying
during
that
time
to
make
the
deportation
case.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
there
is
no
period
of
limitation
as
such.
however,
there
is
an
administrative
policy
of
compassion.
we
have
--
mr.
charles
gordon
there
are
no
years.
there
are
cases
in
which
it
is
our
conviction
that
the
consequences
of
deportation
are
excessively
severe
because
the
family
ties,
because
of
the
age
of
the
petitioner
and
because
of
other
considerations
urged.
in
those
cases,
we
do
not
press
for
deportation.
there
are
several
thousand
such
cases.
in
our
judgment,
this
was
not
such
a
case.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
moreover
your
honor
that
congress
has
provided
has
provided
avenues
for
relief
in
cases
of
this
kind.
there
are
a
number
of
discretionary
remedies
which
were
available
to
the
petitioner
and
during
the
hearing
he
was
asked,
“do
you
wish
to
apply
for
any
of
these
discretionary
remedies?”
he
said,
“i
am
going
to
think
about
it.
i'll
let
you
know
later
on.”
and
thereafter
he
thought
about
and
decided
not
to
apply.
well,
i
can't
probe
his
mind.
i
do
not
know
why
he
didn't
chose
to
apply,
and
that's
he
didn't
want
to
testify,
about
his
activities.
but
that's
speculations.
the
fact
is
that
there
were
opportunities
for
relief,
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
all
there
is
in
this
deportation,
entry
without
inspection.
there
is
no
other
charge
and
we
don't
claim
that
there's
any
other
deportation
charge
we
would
bring
against
them.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
we
haven't
pursued
this
one
man.
there
has
been
a
whole
group
of
individuals
like
this
and
we
we're
trying
to
make
a
case.
it
was
very
difficult
because
this
man
used
a
false
name
and
it
was
hard
to
connect
him
joe
sherman
with
sam
levine.
finally
we
did
assemble
the
evidence
and
we
proceeded
as
expeditiously
as
we
could.
mr.
charles
gordon
you
honor,
i
do
not
believe
we
have
deported
any
because
the
others
did
apply
for
discretionary
relief
and
were
granted
discretionary
relief.
we
gave
the
same
opportunity
to
this
petitioner.
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
he
must
make
an
application.
he
must
testify,
he
must
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
your
honor,
but
before
we
exercise
our
discretion,
we
would
want
to
know
what
type
of
individual
this
man
is,
what
he's
been
doing
and
whether
he's
deserving
a
discretion.
mr.
charles
gordon
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
should
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
of
this
time
outlining
the
evidence.
petitioner
has
chosen
to
concentrate
on
the
testimony
of
the
witness
edward
morrow.
this
is
only
a
portion
of
the
record.
if
that
was
the
only
evidence,
it
would
concededly
be
inadequate.
but
petitioner
has
conveniently
grossed
over
some
very
important
elements
of
the
record
which
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
under
any
criteria.
in
totality,
we
believe
the
evidence
on
the
record
in
this
case
would
most
likely
satisfy
any
criterion
of
persuasion.
the
evidence
is
summarized
for
the
court’s
information,
that’s
pages
2
to
6
of
our
brief.
briefly,
it
is
as
follows.
first,
there
is
a
united
states
passport
which
was
issued
to
one
samuel
levine
in
june
of
1937.
now,
thoughout
the
proceedings,
petitioner
has
not
denied,
and
yesterday
i
heard
his
counsel
conceived
that
petitioner’s
photograph
appears
on
this
passport.
a
witness,
samuel
robinski
was
called
and
he
said,
“yes,
i’m
a
friend
of
petitioner.
that
is
his
photograph
on
the
passport.
petitioner
asked
me
to
go
with
him
to
the
passport
office
and
to
appear
as
a
witness
on
his
unidentified
witness
on
his
behalf”
and
he
said,
“i
signed
my
name
‘robinski’
to
that
passport
and
that’s
petitioner’s
photograph
on
the
passport”.
moreover,
the
identifying
data
on
the
passport
correspond
with
petitioner’s
identification.
for
example,
he
has
a
scar
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand.
at
the
hearing,
he
was
asked
to
show
his
hand,
has
a
scar
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand.
the
passport
shows
a
scar
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand.
next,
there
are
documents
which
include
notations
on
the
passport
itself
which
show
that
this
passport
was
used.
first,
there
is
a
visa
by
the
french
consul
general
in
new
york;
couple
of
days
after
the
issuance
of
the
passport,
a
visa
for
the
holder
of
the
passport
to
go
to
france.
then
there
was
a
notation
on
the
passport
that
the
holder
of
the
passport
was
admitted
by
the
immigration
authorities
in
france,
a
couple
of
days
--
a
few
days
later
when
the
boat
ducked.
then,
there
is
a
notation
on
the
passport
that
in
december
of
1938,
the
holder
of
that
passport
again
used
it.
he
presented
that
to
the
american
consular
authorities
in
barcelona
and
asked
them
to
approve
it
for
his
coming
to
the
united
states.
then,
there
are
document,
additional
documents,
the
american
consulate
in
france
show
that
a
number
of
persons
had
arrived
in
france
and
these
were
expected
to
being
persons
who
were
using
that
passport
to
spain.
among
them
is
less
than
the
name
of
samuel
levine
and,
finally,
on
the
passport
itself
there
was
a
stamp
by
the
immigration
service,
showing
that
the
holder
of
this
passport,
samuel
levine,
was
admitted
to
the
united
states
under
that
name
in
december
of
1938.
now,
we
add
to
that
the
testimony
of
witness
morrow.
this
is
cumulative.
this
is
supporting
evidence.
this
in
itself,
is
i
say
is
not
enough.
but
added
to
the
other
evidence,
it
is
quite
impressive.
now
something
about
mr.
morrow,
this,
as
the
court
indicated
and
counsel
agreed
yesterday,
this
is
not
a
professional
witness.
this
is
a
reporter
for
the
new
york
times,
a
man
who
was
worth
as
his
report
for
over
20
years.
he
himself
pored
in
spain
and
we
located
him
after
some
diligent
gun
showing.
we
found
out
that
this
person
had
been
in
spain.
we
asked
him,
“do
you
remember
this
person?”
we
showed
this
photograph.
well,
he
said,
“i
can’t
say
i
do.
that
photograph
is
vaguely
familiar
to
me.
i
can’t
say
i
don’t”.
“do
you
remember
the
name
‘sam
or
samuel
levine?”
“that
rings
a
bell
on
my
mind
but
i
can’t
say.
i
think
there
was
some
such
fellow
but
i
can’t
say.
he
was
asked,
“would
you
want
to
look
at
the
person
we
have
in
mind
and
see
if
that
will
refresh
your
recollection?”
he
said,
“i’d
be
glad
to”.
so
in
one
day
when
there
was
a
hearing,
unknown
to
the
petitioner,
mr.
morrow
this
non-professional
public
expert
individual,
“this
is
the
only
interest,
who
has
been
telling
the
truth”,
he
said,
went
to
the
immigration
office
and
sat
down
there
in
the
lobby
and
observed
the
petitioner.
and
after
this
observation
for
now,
“yes”,
he
said
“i
remember
now.
this
is
the
sam
levine
that
served
with
me
in
the
spanish
loyalist
forces
in
spain”.
he
says,
“i
remember
it
too
that
he
went
back
with
me
on
the
s.s.
ausonia,
with
the
group
of
his
--
who
sailed
from
spain
back
to
the
united
states
as
the
loyalist
were
losing
the
war
in
1938.
and,
i
remember
he
was
on
the
ship
at
that
time”.
now
i
suggest
that
on
the
face
of
this
record,
the
petitioner’s
failure
to
offer
any
of
these,
none
at
all.
he
didn’t
testify,
he
didn’t
produce
any
witnesses,
could’ve
produced
document
possibly,
he
could’ve
produced
witness.
he
said
nothing;
he
testified
to
nothing.
he
just
sat
there
and
did
not
open
his
mouth.
now,
he
is
the
person
who
knew
the
facts;
he
is
the
person
that
best
knew
the
facts.
and,
added
to
this
record
and
on
the
face
of
this
record,
i
think
his
silence
is
also
significant.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
said,
“it
is
vaguely
familiar
to
me”.
mr.
charles
gordon
that’s
all
he
said.
he
was
a
careful
witness.
he
didn’t
want
to
comment
so.
mr.
charles
gordon
as
i
recall,
it
was
about
four
months.
mr.
charles
gordon
over
25
years.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think,
sir,
that
this
is
a
normal
reaction
that
the
person’s
recollection
can’t
be
refreshed
as
he
thinks
about
the
incidents,
as
he
thinks
of
the
events.
and
as
he
sees
the
individual,
his
memory
can
be
refreshed.
to
me,
this
seems
like
the
reaction
of
a
very
honest
and
a
very
sincere
witness.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
think,
perhaps
it
might
have
been
enough.
i
would
want
to
state
--
mr.
charles
gordon
because
there
was
a
witness,
mr.
robinski,
who
is
a
friend
of
the
petitioners
who
said,
“i
went
with
him
to
the
passport
office
and
he
asked
me
to
be
an
identified
witness”.
that
is
his
photograph
on
the
passport
and
that,
together
with
the
showing
that
the
passport
was
used
presumably
by
the
same
individual,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
might
be
enough.
but
if
you
add
to
it
the
testimony
of
witness
morrow
and
add
to
it
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
refused
to
give
any
evidence,
it
seems
to
be
this
is
a
pretty
good
case
by
any
criterion.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
it
would
satisfy
any
text.
frankly,
i
think
it
would
satisfy
beyond
–
mr.
charles
gordon
it
seems
to
me
it
would.
this
is
only
a
matter
of
opinion
but
it
seems
to
me
what
we
have
here
is
an
overwhelming
showing
that
an
individual
who
wants
the
petitioner
obtain
this
passport
and
the
passport
says,
“i
intend
to
use
it
within
the
few
days”.
the
application
says.
and,
the
showing
is
that
the
individual
obtained
this
passport,
went
to
france
with
his
picture
on
it,
mind
you,
this
identifying
data.
everytime
that
passport
is
presented,
somebody
looks
at
it,
compares
the
picture
with
the
person
who
present
the
passport
and
that
passport
obtained
by
the
petitioner
was
used
in
going
to
france
and
in
returning
from
spain
in
1938.
it
seems
to
me
that’s
pretty
overwhelming
evidence.
at
least,
the
factfinder
(voice
overlap)
so.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
and
it
shows
it,
the
court
of
appeals
just
wrongly
understand
it
then
i
think,
your
honor,
might
wish
to
remand
it.
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
right,
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
very
clear
from
the
opinion
of
judge
friendly
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
and
i
agree
that
the
only
standard
applicable
to
this
case
is
the
one
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
not.
these
terms
are
apparent
to
the
administrative
procedure.
what
congress
had
in
mind
here
was
an
assessment
of
facts
by
experts,
by
people
who
were
trained
to
assess
the
fact
and
who
didn’t
need
the
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
it’s
something
different,
your
honor.
i
think
all
the
statute
–
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor
–
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
i
don’t
agree.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
friendly
said
that
“the
standard
of
reasonable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence
which
are
set
forth
in
the
two
places
of
the
statute
applies
to
the
factfinder,
it
applies
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
two
different
test.
if
i
could,
i
would
try
to
stay
clear
of
preponderance
because
it
has
no
bearing
yet.
there
is
–
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
so;
it
has
been
used
in
isolated
cases.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
was
not
used
in
this
one.
that
is
not
so,
your
honor.
there
was
no
suggestion
here
of
any
preponderance
because
it’s
not
relevant
to
this
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
think
it’s
hide
in,
your
honor;
i
agree.
our
view
is
that
the
statute
was
saying
this
“that
in
order
to
make
a
determination,
the
factfinder
must
be
persuaded”.
and
i
don’t
care
if
you
call
it
preponderance
or
convincing
–-
mr.
charles
gordon
and
conviction
on
the
part
of
the
fact-finder.
am
i
convinced
of
the
truth
of
these
charges?
now
was
the
factfinder
is
convinced
of
the
truth
of
these
charges?
he
makes
a
determination.
and
the
only
issue
then
under
the
statute
and
under
the
criteria
which
have
been
applied
by
this
court
is,
was
that
determination
based
on
substantial
evidence
or
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence
as
the
statute
says.
that,
as
this
court
has
set,
means
that
could
the
factfinder
--
could
a
reasonable
mind
sitting
in
the
place
of
the
factfinder
have
come
to
the
same
determination?
mr.
charles
gordon
the
standard
is
that
what
you’re
talking
about
the
standard
of
evidence?
mr.
charles
gordon
the
burden
of
proof
unquestionably
is
on
the
government
to
establish
--
mr.
charles
gordon
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
person
is
an
alien;
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
is
deportable.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
told
to
us
by
the
statute.
it
says
so
specifically.
section
242
(b)
says,
“no
decision
of
deportability
shall
be
valid
unless
it
is
based
on
reasonable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence.”
to
me,
that
means
–
mr.
charles
gordon
burden
of
proof?
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
always
been
conceded,
your
honor,
and
it
is
always
been
stated
by
this
court
and
agreed
to
by
the
government
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
it’s
not
talking
about
the
schneiderman
case.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
weight?
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
those
to
me
our
terms
which
were
developed
by
courts
and
are
relevant
in
court
proceedings.
here
we
have
a
factfinder,
an
administrative
also
who
was
trained
to
make
determinations.
he
must
act
on
conviction.
he
must
be
persuaded.
mr.
charles
gordon
by
substantial
evidence;
that
is
the
statutory
criterion.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
this
is
–
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
in
the
terms
of
this
case
is
not
relevant
because
there
is
no
question
of
balancing
evidence
here.
there’s
only
evidence
presented
by
the
government.
the
respondent
presented
no
proof.
mr.
charles
gordon
exactly!
the
question
is,
does
the
factfinder
believe
this
evidence.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
believes
it
and
that
the
evidences
–
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
the
statute
goes
further.
it
says
that
the
evidence
must
be
reasonable.
as
we
translate
it,
he
must
be
reasonably
persuaded
by
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
congress
took
pains
to
say
that
this
was
the
standard
on
which
the
factfinder
must
act.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
that
“deportation”
--sec.
242
(b),
which
is
set
forth
in
full
at
page
33
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix.
it
says,
“that
deportation
procedure
shall
be
in
accordance
with
regulations
which
are
prescribed
by
the
attorney
general
and
includes
a
listing
of
four
specific
safeguards,
including
that
the
decision
must
be
based
on
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence”.
and
that
it
goes
on
to
say
that
“the
procedure
so
prescribe
shall
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
procedure
for
determining
deportability”.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
here
reposed
in
the
attorney
general
the
responsibility
not
only
for
conducting
the
hearings
but
for
fashioning
the
procedure
under
which
the
hearings
were
to
be
conducted.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
completely,
your
honor,
because
the
attorney
general
must
bear
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
individual
was
an
alien
and
that
he
is
deportable.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i
suggest
one
additional
fact
which
you
might
wish
to
taken
into
account.
the
administrate
--
the
deportation
process
has
always
been
administrative.
this
has
never
been
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
charles
gordon
you’re
right.
and
it
is
a
procedure
which
must
be
fashioned
with
care
and
it
is.
the
statute
spells
out
in
great
details
the
rules,
the
procedures,
the
safeguards
which
shall
be
applicable
in
those
cases.
and
this
court
sets,
in
addition
to
those
rules,
to
assure
that
due
process
is
observed.
now,
the
function
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
and
i
submit
respectfully,
is
not
to
fashion
rules
for
administrative
proceedings
–
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor
–-
mr.
charles
gordon
i
agree
that
it
is
a
very
serious
responsibility
in
the
attorney
general
in
charged
with
regard
to
the
--
as
a
serious
responsibility.
but
congress
has
spoken.
now
if
congress
has
no
authority,
then
this
court
comes
into
this
picture.
but
there’s
no
contention
to
hear
that
congress
has
no
authority.
the
only
contention
here
is
that
congress
has
not
spoken.
therefore,
the
court
has
authority.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
a
complete
non-executive.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
power
to
fashion
rules,
the
power
to
fashion
procedures
is
an
administrative
power
and
that
the
only
time
this
court
comes
in
to
the
picture
is
if
there’s
a
violation
of
due
process.
that’s
not
charged
here
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
the
case
in
which
the
court
shall
--
can
be
asked
to
fashion
rules.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
this
court,
your
honor,
but
other
courts
have.
mr.
charles
gordon
let
me
lend
my
statement,
your
honor.
this
court
in
many
cases
has
stated
that
it
is
not
concerned
with
the
weight
of
the
evidence
with
the
--
whether
the
decision
of
the
factfinder
is
right,
with
whether
admissible
evidence
was
received.
the
only
concern,
and
this
is
stated
in
case
after
case,
the
only
concern
of
this
court
or
of
any
court
in
relation
to
the
findings
of
fact,
is
to
determine
whether
in
the
old
language
of
the
old
case
whether
there
was
any
evidence.
and,
under
the
more
recent
criteria,
the
only
concern
of
the
court
has
been,
as
stated
by
this
court
and
other
courts,
to
determine
whether
there
is
reasonable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence.
this
is
stated
in
case
after
case.
now,
as
the
substantial
evidence,
there
had
been
lower
court
decisions,
again
i
amend
my
statement,
i
recall
something
else.
this
court
has
said
in
the
consolidated
edison
case
that
substantial
evidence
–-
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir,
an
administrative
case
of
the
labor
board.
the
terms
of
the
(inaudible),
they
used
throughout
administrative
laws.
they
used
in
the
administrative
procedure
and
the
language
is
very
similar
to
this.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
the
court
said
that
through
mr.
justice
frankfurther
that
“we
must
take
into
account
the
solidity
of
proof”
-
that
was
the
language
–
“which
is
necessary
to
deport
a
long
time
resident”.
i
translate
that
to
mean
we
must
take
into
account
the
substantiality
of
the
evidence.
and
to
me
the
term,
“substantiality
of
the
evidence”
is
an
extensive
one.
i
say
that
circumstance
is
different
and
at
least
plenty
of
room
to
determine
how
much
evidence,
how
solid
the
evidence
must
be
in
the
case
of
a
long
time
resident.
i
can
see
that
it
must
be
solid
indeed.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
the
first
place,
the
administrative
factfinder;
in
the
second
place,
the
reviewing
court.
your
honor,
as
i
see
the
statute,
the
reference
to
substantial
evidence
or
reasonable
probative
as
substantial
evidence
is
two-fold,
one
reference
in
242
(b),
that
is
addressed
to
the
factfinder
and
tells
him
he
must
act
on
reasonable
and
probative
and
substantial
evidence;
and
the
other
is
in
section
106
(a)
-
that’s
addressed
to
the
reviewing
court
and
tell
us
there
that
the
administrative
factfinding
is
conclusive
if
it
is
based
on
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
alright,
i
see
my
time
is
running
and
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
something
that
was
discussed
yesterday.
i
think
the
court
is
very
much
interested
and
that
is
the
question
of
discretionary
relief.
we
had
some
discussion
yesterday
about
the
possibilities
of
discretionary
relief
and
i
pointed
out
that
the
opportunity
to
apply
for
such
relief
was
given
to
the
petitioner
that
his
counsel
said
at
the
hearing,
“i’d
like
sometime
to
think
about
it”
and
at
the
end
of
the
period
which
is
allotted
to
him,
he
did
not
apply
for
discretionary
relief.
now,
we
agree
that
this
is
a
statute
with
severe
consequences.
but
congress
has
made
allowance
in
many
ways
for
alleviating
those
consequences.
now,
if
this
applicant
had
been
sincerely
desirous
of
applying
for
relief,
there
were
many
obnoxious
relief
opened
him
and
there
were
mentioned
at
the
deportation
hearing.
he
was
told,
“there
are
various
types
of
a
relief
for
which
you
can
apply”.
there
is,
for
example,
and
this
was
matches
the
hearing,
section
243
(h).
you
may
wish
to
claim
that
you’d
be
physically
persecuted
if
you
would
deported
to
poland.
there
is
section
249
which
deals
with
specifically
with
this
type
of
case.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir.
it
would
permit
him
to
remain;
some
of
these
would
permit
him
to
remain
as
permanent
resident.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir,
and
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
your
honor
mentioned
that
yesterday
and
he
was
not
told
anything
about
it
and
i
want
it
indicate
that
this
is
still
available.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
can
dispute
deportability.
that
is
exactly
what
our
regulation
say
and
ask
for
relief
at
the
same
time
conditionally.
mr.
charles
gordon
our
regulations
provide
that
exactly
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
gordon
it’s
hcf
arm.
242.17
(d),
if
i
recall
it
correctly.
it’s
242,
17
u.c.
or
d;
i
think
d.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
says
that
a
person
who
applies
for
discretionary
relief
does
not
thereby
conceive
deportability.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
it
is
the
regulation
now.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
he
never
applied
for
the
relief.
we
don’t
know
whether
it
is
available
then
but
he
seems
technically
within
the
context
of
that
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
sir.
he
is
illegible
but
he
has
to
show
that
he
is
otherwise
admissible.
now
that
might
entail
some
difficulties
but
i
don’t
see
what
would
the
difficulties
are.
mr.
charles
gordon
if
he
was
otherwise
admissible,
the
statute
ways
that
we
don’t
have
anything
to
do.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
has
a
--
as
far
as
we
know,
we
don’t,
your
honor.
you
see
he
didn’t
testify.
but
counsel
says
he
has
an
american
citizen
waiver.
if
he
would
to
tell
us
this,
and
that
of
course
would
put
him
within
the
statute,
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
automatic
waiver
if
he
is
otherwise
admissible.
now,
the
only
thing
i
can
see
about
the
otherwise
admissible
part
is
that
when
he
returned,
he
didn’t
have
a
proper
visa.
but
there
is
a
specific
provision
for
waiting
that
ineligibility;
that’s
section
211
(b).
mr.
charles
gordon
the
attorney
general.
mr.
charles
gordon
oh,
the
attorney
general
has
many
discretionary
powers,
your
honor,
and
exercised
them
very
freely.
there
are
many
way
of
deportability.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
this
remains
a
mystery
but
yesterday,
counsel
said
that
he
is
a
construction
worker.
i
myself
did
not
know
what
he
did.
at
one
point,
a
hearing
or
in
a
statement
that
he
gave,
he
said
he
was
a
taxi
driver.
but
i
don’t
know
what
he
was
doing
now.
we
don’t
know
much
about
this
individual
because
he
has
never
told
us
anything.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
those
investigations
have
limitations.
we
can’t
tell
exactly
what
the
individual
was
doing.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
there
was
no
limitation
in
time
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
gordon
nothing
in
the
regulations
but
as
i
told
you
–
mr.
charles
gordon
in
practice,
we
do
have
a
policy
of
not
bringing
proceedings
in
cases
of
excess
deportship
and,
if
your
honor,
this
information
i
should
tell
there
are
about
2,000
such
cases
where
deportation
proceedings
–
mr.
charles
gordon
none
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
no
deportation
cases.
mr.
charles
gordon
i’m
not
even
familiar
–
mr.
charles
gordon
it
could
be,
your
honor,
but
i’m
not
familiar
with
those
cases.
this
is
the
only
case
--
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
bench
yesterday,
i
believe
with
mr.
justice
black.
i
informed
the
court
that
there
had
been
a
number
of
people
like
this
who
had
resorted
to
forge
passport.
and
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
we
were
able
to
give
them
relief.
we
did
not
deport
a
single
one
of
them
because
they
applied
for
relief.
we
found
that
they
were
worthy
of
relief
and
we
granted
the
relief.
now,
there
has
not
been
any
individual
who
has
been
deported
on
the
similar
circumstance
and
i
suspect
that
if
this
petitioner
was
to
apply
for
relief,
it’s
quite
possible
that
he
would
obtain
the
relief.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
his
counsel,
i
would
not
have
told
this
special
inquiry
officer,
who
gave
him
this
opportunity.
special
inquiry
officer
said,
“i’d
be
glad
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
apply
for
discretionary
relief”.
he
said,
“well,
let
me
think
about
it”.
this
is
counsel
speaking,
“let
me
think
about
it
for
a
couple
of
weeks”.
he
thought
about
it
special
inquiry
officer
to
mention
the
whole
series
of
statute
under
which
he
could
apply
for
relief.
and
after
thinking
about
it,
he
did
not
apply
for
any
discretionary
relief.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
the
statute
said
that
in
certain
circumstances,
the
attorney
general,
in
his
discretion.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir.
he
cannot
act
arbitrarily.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i’m
not
wise
to
the
contrary.
whether
the
person
is
deserving
really
is
more
accurate.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
this
is
what
congress
has
done
it.
it’s
made
a
–
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
in
the
first
place,
he
must
be
deported.
they
were
targeting
about
aliens
who
went
to
the
terms
of
the
statute
are
deportable.
then
the
statute
says,
“even
though
congress
has
said
these
individuals
are
deportable,
yet
we
will
provide
a
wide
area
in
which
the
attorney
general
can
grant
relief.
and
many
of
these
types
of
remedies
which
congress
has
provided
apply
directly
to
this
petitioner,
a
long
time
resident
for
example.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
right,
but
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
go
out,
your
honor.
he
took
the
risk.
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
make
false
statement
–-
mr.
charles
gordon
i
would
assume
so.
person
who
goes
out
of
the
country
for
19
months,
as
this
individual
did,
and
chooses
to
fight
the
farn
army.
however,
laudable
that
may
be
from
his
stand
point,
yet
he
knows
he
is
violating
the
law.
he
knows
that
he
is
taking
a
risk
if
he
comes
back.
he
knows
–
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
it’s
long
since
passed.
mr.
charles
gordon
my
recollection
is
five
but
i
wouldn’t
conceive
the
three
of
five.
mr.
charles
gordon
that’s
true,
your
honor,
but
he
was
not.
we
didn't
know,
now
of
course,
the
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
thank
you.
