mr.
joseph
forer
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
deportation
case
in
which
the
question
is
what
is
the
standard
of
proof
which
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
must
satisfy
when
it
seeks
to
approve
the
deportability
of
a
resident
alien?
the
petitioner,
joseph
sherman
was
born
in
poland
in
1906.
when
he
was
14
years
old
in
1920,
he
entered
the
united
states
as
an
immigrant
with
his
mother
and
the
rest
of
his
family.
43
years
later
in
march
1963
the
immigration
service
instituted
deportation
proceedings
against
them
on
the
charge
that
he
had
re-entered
the
country
on
december
20,
1938
without
inspection.
now,
in
december
of
1938
and
for
that
matter
beginning
with
the
immigration
act
of
1917
and
up
until
december
of
1952,
there
was
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
on
deportations
for
entry
without
inspection.
but
in
1952,
effective
december
of
1952,
the
current
immigration
and
nationality
act
was
enacted
and
it
retroactively
removed
the
statutes
of
limitations
on
deportation.
so
the
result
is
that
when
this
proceeding
was
brought
against
mr.
sherman
in
march
1963
it
was
brought
not
only
25
years
after
his
alleged
offense
of
illegal
re-entry
or
re-entry
without
inspection
but
also
22
years
after
that
entry
if
it
had
occurred
had
been
later
rest
by
a
statute
of
limitation.
now,
in
the
deportation
proceeding,
the
services
case
rested
on
two
bases
of
evidence.
the
first
section
of
evidence
related
to
a
passport,
the
service
introduced
evidence
that
in
june
of
1937,
the
petitioner
applied
for
a
united
states
passport
under
the
false
name
of
samuel
levine
and
to
his
application
there
was
attached
his
photograph.
a
few
days
after
the
application
was
made,
well,
the
service
then
introduced
a
passport
as
a
self-proving
document
which
on
its
face
indicates
that
it
was
issued
a
few
days
after
this
application
was
made.
this
passport
is
in
the
name
of
samuel
levine
and
then
has
affixed
to
it
petitioner's
photograph.
the
record
doesn't
show
to
whom
that
passport
was
delivered
and
it
doesn't
show
how
it
came
under
the
possession
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
it
doesn't
show
what
happened
to
that
document
between
december
of
1938
when
we
last
get
some
idea
of
its
history
and
the
time
of
the
immigration
proceedings
in
1964
and
1963.
but
the
evidence
does
show
that
in
june
of
1937,
somebody
traveled
to
europe
on
the
passport
issued
to
this
false
samuel
levine.
and
on
december
20,
1938,
somebody
entered
the
united
states
with
the
aid
of
this
passport
issued
to
samuel
levine.
the
only
direct
evidence
that
the
petitioner
had
ever
left
the
country
after
his
original
entry
was
the
testimony
of
a
man
by
the
name
of
edward
morrow.
morrow
had
fight
with
the
loyalist
forces
in
spain
during
part
of
1937
and
1938.
and
he
testified
at
the
deportation
hearing
that
he
had
seen
the
petitioner
also
fighting
with
the
loyalist
forces
in
spain
during
that
time.
and
he
also
testified,
morrow
testified,
that
when
he
returned
to
the
united
states
from
spain
by
way
of
france
on
the
steam-ship
ausonia
which
arrived
in
the
united
states
in
december
of
1938
that
the
petitioner
was
on
that
boat
and
he
also
testified
that
he
knew
the
petitioner
had
used
the
name
samuel
levine.
now,
morrow
was
testifying
27
years
after
these
alleged
events.
by
his
own
testimony
he
had
never
spoken
to
the
petitioner
or
to
this
samuel
levine.
he
had
never
been
introduced
to
him.
he
had
never
had
direct
contact
with
the
person
that
he
claimed
was
petitioner.
as
he
testified,
he
had
merely
seen
that
person
around
and
in
some
unexplained
fashion,
unexplained
since
he
had
never
been
introduced
to
him
or
spoken
to
him,
he
knew
somehow
that
the
man
was
named
samuel
levine.
considering
that
this
was
27
years
after
casual
contact,
this
is
on
its
face
and
heroic
achievement
of
recollection.
particularly
since
morrow's
memory
was
admittedly
weak
on
matters
which
were
much
more
reasonable.
morrow
himself
admitted
that
he
was
not
positive
of
his
identification
but
said
and
i
quote,
“i
feel
i
saw
this
man
in
spain.”
but
the
difficulty
with
morrow's
testimony
goes
further
than
that.
before
the
hearing
at
which
morrow
testified,
he
had
been
interviewed
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
and
he
was
shown
this
passport
photograph
of
the
petitioner
which
had
been
on
the
passport
of
samuel
levine
and
morrow
hadn't
been
able
to
identify
the
petitioner
from
that
photograph.
although
obviously
that
photograph
was
a
better
likeness
of
the
petitioner
in
1938
and
the
petitioner
himself
was
in
1964.
furthermore,
when
morrow
was
interviewed
by
the
service
before
the
hearing
and
he
was
asked
about
joseph
sherman
or
samuel
levine,
he
couldn't
recall
either
name
much
less
recalled
that
this
was
a
person
he
had
seen
in
spain.
now,
he
suggested
that
perhaps
the
subject
of
the
passport
photograph,
he
suggested
in
the
interview
that
perhaps
the
subject
of
the
passport
photograph
had
been
on
the
ship,
the
aquitania
on
which
he,
morrow
had
sailed
from
the
united
states
to
france
in
june
of
1937.
but
when
he
testified
at
the
hearing,
he
reversed
them
so.
this
time,
he
said,
the
petitioner
was
not
on
the
voyage
to
france
in
june
of
1937,
the
aquitania.
this
time
he
put
him
on
the
voyage
to
the
united
states
from
france
in
december
1938
on
the
steam-ship
ausonia.
now,
on
this
evidence
the
petitioner
was
ordered
to
deport
and
on
review
by
the
third
circuit
--
second
circuit,
i'm
sorry,
judges
waterman
and
smith
with
judge
friendly
dissenting,
set
aside
the
deportation
order
and
remanded
it
the
service.
they
held
that
is
the
majority
of
the
three-judge
panel
held
that
in
a
deportation
case
against
a
long
resident
alien,
such
as
the
petitioner,
the
service
is
obliged
to
prove
its
case
by
the
criminal
standard
of
proof
that
is
it
must
prove
the
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
since
the
standard
regularly
employed
in
deportation
proceedings
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
are
the
factfinders
is
that
deportability
merely
has
to
be
proven
by
a
preponderance
of
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence,
the
panel
vacated
the
deportation
order
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
service
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
higher
standard
of
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
judge
friendly
as
i
said,
the
senate,
he
was
sympathetic
as
he
said
to
the
idea
of
requiring
more
than
a
rare
preponderance
standard
in
cases
of
deportation
involving
the
resident
aliens.
but
he
felt
and
he
said
that
congress
had
foreclosed
the
matter
because
it
had
provided
a
standard
of
proof
for
the
service
in
the
administrative
deportation
hearing
by
sections
106
(a)
and
242
(b)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
these
two
sections
provide
in
substance
that
administrative
findings
of
deportability
are
valid
and
conclusive
if
and
only
if
these
findings
are
supported
by
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
the
two-court
majority
felt
that
those
two
sections
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
situation
because
they
related
only
to
a
judicial
review
and
were
simply
the
substantial
evidence
--
the
familiar
substantial
evidence
standard
for
judicial
review.
the
government
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
second
circuit
took
the
case
en
banc.
the
en
banc
court
reversed
the
panel
and
sustained
the
deportation
order
adapting
judge
friendly's
dissenting
opinion
of
the
panel.
judges
waterman
and
smith
dissented
that
hearing
to
their
original
opinion.
now,
as
the
case
was
decided
in
the
second
circuit,
the
focus
was
on
the
applicability
of
sections
242
(b)
and
106
(a)
of
the
act.
and
in
our
brief,
we
show
and
i
think
we
show
quite
conclusively
that
these
two
sections
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
both
on
the
basis
of
their
language,
their
legislative
history
and
their
administrative
interpretation.
on
all
three
bases,
it
is
clear
that
these
sections
merely
relate
to
the
standard
for
judicial
review
and
furthermore
they
relate
not
to
the
burden
of
proof
or
the
nature
of
the
burden
of
proof
but
rather
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
on
which
the
order
must
be
based.
now,
as
we
understand
the
government's
brief,
the
government
does
not
contend
otherwise,
it
does
not
contend
that
these
two
sections
do
apply
to
the
service
at
the
--
as
the
setting
a
standard
of
proof
what
they
must
do
with
the
deportation
hearing.
so
really,
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
argue
now
that
these
two
sections
are
not
in
terms
controlling.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
beg
your
pardon?
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
the
court
of
appeals
held
they
are
relevant.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
no,
the
court
of
appeals
held
they
were
controlling.
mr.
joseph
forer
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i
don't
--
we
disagree
with
that
and
we
think
we
have
demonstrated
why
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong.
i'm
just
saying
that
i'm
just
going
to
rely
in
my
brief
for
that
demonstration
to
convince
you
because
i
don't
think
that
the
government
disagrees
with
us,
so
i
don't
want
to
spend
my
time
on
oral
argument
on
a
point
that
at
least
i
think
i
can
just
rely
on
our
brief.
now,
the
government
does
try
to
draw
certain
inferences
and
say
that
the
existence
of
the
judicial
review
standard
has
an
influence
but
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
impossible
to
reason
backward
from
a
judicial
review
standard
as
to
what
is
the
standard
for
the
burden
of
proof
at
the
trial.
in
a
criminal
case,
on
judicial
review
the
jury's
verdict,
the
finding
of
guilt
has
to
stand
if
it
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence
as
that's
the
same
substantial
evidence
test
as
in
administrative
proceedings.
and
yet
the
standard
of
proof
at
the
criminal
trial
is
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
we
say
that
since
congress
has
not
fixed
the
standard
of
proof
and
since
at
the
administrative
proceeding
and
since
you
can't
reason
backward
from
the
judicial
standard
of
proof,
there
simply
is
no
statutory
standard
of
proof
and
that
means
that
the
standard
has
to
be
defined
by
the
judicial
system
and
ultimately
by
this
court.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
in
the
case
of
resident
aliens,
for
reasons
i
will
go
to
in
a
minute,
the
standards
should
be
either
that
of
the
criminal
standard
of
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
or
at
least
the
standard
which
the
court
has
created
in
denaturalization
cases
whereby
the
government
must
prove
lost
citizen
--
denaturalization
by
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence
beyond
a
mere
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
the
denaturalization
cases
as
well
as
in
other
kinds
of
cases
such
as
cancellation
of
land
grants,
the
court
required
compliance
with
this
higher
standard
of
proof
that
is
with
the
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence
standard
which
is
of
course
a
higher
standard
than
the
traditional
civil
standard
of
preponderance
on
the
grounds
that
in
those
cases,
denaturalization
or
cancellation
of
land
patents
that
those
cases
involved
a
revocation
of
precious
rights
conferred
by
governmental
action.
now,
the
same
logic
obviously
applies
to
deportation
cases
against
resident
aliens.
resident
aliens
have
been
granted
by
governmental
action,
the
precious
right
to
reside
and
remain
in
this
country.
and
with
that
right
they
acquire
and
have
been
granted
a
whole
complex
of
other
rights
which
residents
of
this
country
have.
and
aliens
who
have
accepted
this
right
have
directed
the
course
of
their
lives
in
reliance
on
the
possession
of
these
rights.
so
that
if
you
take
the
logic
of
the
cases
involving
cancellation
of
other
governmental
grants,
at
least
the
denaturalization
standard
should
be
applied
to
deportation
cases
involving
aliens
who
have
been
admitted
for
permanent
resident.
but
we
think
that
there
are
still
other
reasons
for
requiring
a
higher
standard
than
the
preponderance
standard
and
that
these
reasons
call
for
adopting
the
criminal
stand.
and
this
we
think
because
in
several
respects
in
terms
of
its
consequences,
its
nature,
its
procedures,
deportation
cases
should
for
the
purposes
of
the
standard
of
proof
be
equated
with
criminal
cases.
now,
deportation
is
--
of
a
resident
alien
is
different
in
any
other
kind
of
administrative
or
civil
procedure.
because
that
deportation
is
a
deprivation
of
personal
liberty
and
it
is
one
which
in
many
cases
and
perhaps
most
cases
is
a
more
drastic
deprivation
of
liberty
for
the
alien
and
for
his
family
who
may
be
citizens,
then
the
usual
term
of
imprisonment.
now,
whatever
the
case
may
be
for
theoretical
constitutional
purpose,
realistically,
the
deportation
of
a
resident
alien
is
punishment
and
as
to
him,
that
is
punishment,
and
this
case
illustrates
that.
in
this
very
case,
the
government
is
seeking
to
uproot
a
man
who
has
lived
in
this
country
since
he
was
a
child
for
46
of
the
60
years.
his
family
is
here,
his
friends
are
here.
his
means
of
making
a
livelihood,
his
skills,
his
resources
and
ability
to
survive,
his
very
ability
to
communicate
and
the
only
language
he
knows,
these
depend
on
his
remaining
here
and
the
government
is
attempting
to
remove
him
from
this
environment
and
return
him
to
a
country
from
which
for
all
realistic
purposes,
he's
a
stranger.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
he
is
a
workman.
he
has
developed
worked
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
is
now
working
in
the
construction
industry.
i
do
not
know
the
exact
trade,
but
he
is
now
working
in
the
american
construction
industry,
at
different
times,
he's
a
garment
worker,
taxi
cab
driver.
and
his
work
now
involved
--
he
has
to
communicate
with
other
workers
and
he
can
communicate
with
other
workers
because
he
speaks
english.
his
job
was
here,
his
wife
was
here,
and
this
obviously
would
be
a
terrible
deprivation
to
send
him
back.
mr.
joseph
forer
this
is
--
well,
first
of
all,
this
is
not
an
exclusion
provision.
it
is
an
expulsion
provision.
i
mean
they
institute
a
proceeding
against
him
as
a
resident
alien.
secondly,
they
didn't
charge
him
with
a
fraudulent
entry,
in
which
case
incidentally
there
would
have
been
a
five-year
statute
limitation.
they
charged
him
with
entry
without
inspection
as
an
immigrant.
mr.
joseph
forer
in
1938.
he
originally
entered
1920.
there
is
no
question
that
entry
was
legal
and
he
was
inspected
and
he
was
admitted.
their
claim
is
that
he
left
the
country
in
1937
to
go
to
fight
in
spain
and
he
came
back
in
1938
posing
as
an
american
citizen.
and
it
is
that
entry
which
they
claim
a
proof,
it
is
that
entry
in
which
they
now
say
subjects
him
to
expulsion.
did
i
made
myself
clear,
justice
black?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
reason
for
not
wanting
him
back?
well,
it
isn't
--
i
don't
know.
there
is
no
indication
whether
they
wanted
him
back
or
not.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
know
that
they
had
any
objection.
we
don't
even
know
that
he
--
assuming
that
they
prove
that
he
left.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
would
have
--
i
mean
that
is
a
historic
fact
that
they
objected
to
--
people
going
to
fight
in
spain
and
especially
american
citizens.
of
course
this
man
was
not
an
american
citizen.
they
never
had
a
chance.
assuming
he
left,
assuming
their
theory
is
proved,
they
never
had
a
chance
to
indicate
that
they
had
an
objection
or
didn't
have
an
objection.
that's
their
complaint.
they
didn't
have
a
chance
to
inspect
him.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
man
who
testified
against
him
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
morrow
who
had
fought
in
spain
and
who
testified
that
he
had
seen
the
petitioner
in
spain.
mr.
joseph
forer
seen
him
in
spain,
yes.
and
as
i
say,
his
testimony
is
suspect
--
mr.
joseph
forer
morrow
was
in
spain.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
but
he
said
that
he
was
on
the
loyalist
side
and
not
on
the
franco
side
and
he
said
that
the
petitioner
was
on
the
franco
side.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
he
is
not
a
professional
informer.
the
service
apparently
went
around
looking
for
people
who
had
fought
in
spain.
they
had
a
clue
because
they
had
this
passport
of
a
samuel
levine
and
the
evidence
is
that
this
samuel
levine
whoever
he
is
had
been
in
barcelona
during
the
war
and
they
know
--
they
had
a
list
of
american
citizens
who
fought
for
the
loyalists
in
spain.
so
they
went
around
looking
for
some
veteran
of
the
civil
war
who
was
ready
to
testify
that
the
sherman
had
been
--
he
have
seen
the
sherman
in
spain.
they
finally
found
somebody
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
forer
the
record
doesn't
show,
but
i'm
sure.
mr.
joseph
forer
no
he's
not
a
professional
informer
unless
he'd
become
one
since.
he
was
not
a
professional
informer.
but
the
point
is
that
professional
informer
or
no
professional
informer,
he
started
out
knowing
nothing.
and
the
more
he
hunted
with
hounds,
the
more
he
acquired
the
ability
to
identify
the
hare.
now,
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
now,
because
of
the
severe
and
punitive
aspects
of
deportation,
this
court
in
jordan
against
the
de
george
applied
the
deportation
statute,
a
doctrine
which
otherwise
is
confined
to
criminal
statutes,
namely
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine.
so,
by
the
same
token,
it
seemed
to
us
the
court
can
logically
apply
the
criminal
standards
of
proof.
another
reason
aside
from
the
consequences
of
deportation
are
the
causes
of
deportation.
if
you
read
the
causes
which
are
listed
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
they
read
like
a
penal
code.
they
constitute
basically
a
catalogue
of
offenses.
many
of
which
are
supposed
to
show
moral
turpitude
or
danger
to
the
state.
moreover,
it's
an
unenlightened
kind
of
penal
code.
it
inflicts
banishment
for
trivial
matters
to
the
most
remote
conduct
and
even
is
adhered
to
offenses,
once
barred
by
statute
of
limitations
and
to
offenses
which
weren't
the
broad
of
all
offenses
at
the
time
they
were
committed.
and
what
point
is
the
really
punitive
aspect
of
deportation
as
opposed
to
its
ostensible
regulatory
aspect
is
that
many
of
the
causes,
perhaps
most
of
the
causes
of
deportation
have
no
reasonable
or
rational
relationship
to
the
avowed
regulatory
objective
of
deportation.
the
regulatory
objective
of
deportation,
the
thing
that
this
court
has
said
takes
it
out
of
requiring
the
criminal
--
the
constitutional
criminal
safeguard,
the
regulatory
aspects
is
that
the
united
states
is
just
getting
rid
of
somebody
who
is
--
of
an
alien
who
isn't
fit
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
residing
here.
but
actually,
nobody
makes
a
determination
of
fitness,
and
in
this
very
case,
who
could
make
a
rational
--
can
draw
a
rational
conclusion
that
the
petitioner's
unfit
to
live
in
this
country,
because
if
you
accept
everything
that
the
government
says
is
true,
in
1938,
because
he
wanted
to,
in
his
enthusiasm
to
risk
his
life
as
a
premature
anti-fascist
fighter,
he
cheated
on
getting
a
passport
and
entering
and
leaving
the
country.
this
is
some
30
years
ago.
in
its
procedures,
deportation
is
also
like
a
criminal
action.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
the
charge
is,
i
said,
assuming
everything
that
he
say
is
true
everything
and
not
even
more
than
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
charge
is
that
he
entered
without
inspection.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
he
entered,
i
suppose
you
could
evade
inspection
or
avoid
inspection
in
a
number
of
ways
(voice
overlap).
you
can
pretend
to
be
a
citizen
and
get
away
with
it,
you
can
hide
a
wheelbarrow
or
--
mr.
joseph
forer
they
claim.
they
think
they
have
proved
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
came
in
using
the
false
passport
and
thereby
evaded
inspection
as
an
alien.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
the
point.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
the
point.
now,
i've
talked
about
the
consequences
of
deportation
being
like
that,
a
crime,
i've
said
the
causes
of
deportation
are
analogous
but
the
causes
--
mr.
joseph
forer
what
did
you
say?
mr.
joseph
forer
oh,
no
question
about
it.
but
you
haven't
–
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
it
has
not.
mr.
joseph
forer
for
constitutional
purposes,
this
court
long
ago
decided
that
you
don't
have
indict
by
--
over
a
very
strong
dissent
that
justice
rutledge
for
example,
is
offering.
but
as
justice
jackson
said
in
the
spector
case,
who
said
that
these
administrative
determinations
have
been
sustained
as
constitutional
only
by
considering
them
as
not
inflicting
punishment.
but
the
more
we
go
on,
the
more
they
add
causes
of
deportation,
the
less
these
causes
have
to
with
do
with
the
ostensible
regulatory
purposes.
the
more
these
causes
become
retroactive,
he
says,
the
less
possible
it
becomes
--
to
give
any
logical
content
to
this
doctrine.
and
all
i'm
saying
now
is
that
if
--
maybe
it
is
a
civil,
and
unless
you
overrule
yourself
it
is
civil
for
the
purposes
--
for
constitutional
purposes,
you
care
free
now
to
develop
a
standard
of
proof.
and
the
standard
you
should
develop
and
i
won't
go
into
the
procedures,
but
the
procedures
as
you
know
can
involve
arrest,
supervision
and
so
forth,
considering
these
things,
it
would
be
reasonable
to
make
it
a
criminal
standard
or
at
the
very
least,
the
standard
of
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
it
is
just
--
i
don't
mean
reasonable,
i
mean
the
standard
of
the
denaturalization
case.
now,
it
is
just
simply
offensive
for
the
department
of
justice
to
be
able
to
use
the
same
standard
of
proof
to
destroy
a
man's
life
as
it
prevails
if
you're
trying
to
prove
in
some
small
court,
a
$100-court
case
of
a
sidewalk
slip,
or
a
bill
collection
claim
for
$35,
there's
nothing
new
with
the
courts
adopting
as
a
matter
of
judicial
policy
a
higher
standard
of
proof
and
preponderance
in
civil
cases
including
in
some
cases
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now
i've
mentioned
the
naturalization
cases,
cancellations
of
land
patents,
but
there's
a
whole
host
of
other
situations
in
which
the
english
and
american
common
law
courts
have
used
these
higher
standards.
whenever
fraud
is
involved,
proof
of
a
lost
will,
proof
of
parole
trust,
reformations
of
the
deed,
adultery,
illegitimacy
of
a
child
born
in
wedlock,
and
so
forth,
all
of
these
have
had
higher
standards
of
proof
than
the
traditional
civil
standard.
now,
this
country
is
a
country
of
aliens
and
the
children
and
grandchildren
of
aliens.
in
our
deportation
laws,
because
of
their
harshness,
all
of
which
are
illustrated
here,
their
harshness,
their
rationality,
we
have
in
a
sense
betrayed
our
heritage.
the
court
has
refused
to
confine
congress
as
to
its
power.
it's
refused
to
apply
substantive
due
process,
a
bill
of
attainder
clause,
ex
post
facto,
the
first
amendment,
and
so
forth.
but
it
has
not
refused
to
confine
the
service,
maybe
out
of
remorse
or
some
of
the
thing
it
has
allowed
congress
to
do.
what
we
are
asking
here
is
no
more
than
that
you
do
confine
the
service
to
the
point
where
this
man's
liberty
can
--
and
that
of
any
other
resident
alien
cannot
be
destroyed,
short
of
proof
which
is
more
than
the
bare
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
forer
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
deportation
case
in
which
the
question
is
what
is
the
standard
of
proof
which
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
must
satisfy
when
it
seeks
to
approve
the
deportability
of
a
resident
alien?
the
petitioner,
joseph
sherman
was
born
in
poland
in
1906.
when
he
was
14
years
old
in
1920,
he
entered
the
united
states
as
an
immigrant
with
his
mother
and
the
rest
of
his
family.
43
years
later
in
march
1963
the
immigration
service
instituted
deportation
proceedings
against
them
on
the
charge
that
he
had
re-entered
the
country
on
december
20,
1938
without
inspection.
now,
in
december
of
1938
and
for
that
matter
beginning
with
the
immigration
act
of
1917
and
up
until
december
of
1952,
there
was
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
on
deportations
for
entry
without
inspection.
but
in
1952,
effective
december
of
1952,
the
current
immigration
and
nationality
act
was
enacted
and
it
retroactively
removed
the
statutes
of
limitations
on
deportation.
so
the
result
is
that
when
this
proceeding
was
brought
against
mr.
sherman
in
march
1963
it
was
brought
not
only
25
years
after
his
alleged
offense
of
illegal
re-entry
or
re-entry
without
inspection
but
also
22
years
after
that
entry
if
it
had
occurred
had
been
later
rest
by
a
statute
of
limitation.
now,
in
the
deportation
proceeding,
the
services
case
rested
on
two
bases
of
evidence.
the
first
section
of
evidence
related
to
a
passport,
the
service
introduced
evidence
that
in
june
of
1937,
the
petitioner
applied
for
a
united
states
passport
under
the
false
name
of
samuel
levine
and
to
his
application
there
was
attached
his
photograph.
a
few
days
after
the
application
was
made,
well,
the
service
then
introduced
a
passport
as
a
self-proving
document
which
on
its
face
indicates
that
it
was
issued
a
few
days
after
this
application
was
made.
this
passport
is
in
the
name
of
samuel
levine
and
then
has
affixed
to
it
petitioner's
photograph.
the
record
doesn't
show
to
whom
that
passport
was
delivered
and
it
doesn't
show
how
it
came
under
the
possession
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
it
doesn't
show
what
happened
to
that
document
between
december
of
1938
when
we
last
get
some
idea
of
its
history
and
the
time
of
the
immigration
proceedings
in
1964
and
1963.
but
the
evidence
does
show
that
in
june
of
1937,
somebody
traveled
to
europe
on
the
passport
issued
to
this
false
samuel
levine.
and
on
december
20,
1938,
somebody
entered
the
united
states
with
the
aid
of
this
passport
issued
to
samuel
levine.
the
only
direct
evidence
that
the
petitioner
had
ever
left
the
country
after
his
original
entry
was
the
testimony
of
a
man
by
the
name
of
edward
morrow.
morrow
had
fight
with
the
loyalist
forces
in
spain
during
part
of
1937
and
1938.
and
he
testified
at
the
deportation
hearing
that
he
had
seen
the
petitioner
also
fighting
with
the
loyalist
forces
in
spain
during
that
time.
and
he
also
testified,
morrow
testified,
that
when
he
returned
to
the
united
states
from
spain
by
way
of
france
on
the
steam-ship
ausonia
which
arrived
in
the
united
states
in
december
of
1938
that
the
petitioner
was
on
that
boat
and
he
also
testified
that
he
knew
the
petitioner
had
used
the
name
samuel
levine.
now,
morrow
was
testifying
27
years
after
these
alleged
events.
by
his
own
testimony
he
had
never
spoken
to
the
petitioner
or
to
this
samuel
levine.
he
had
never
been
introduced
to
him.
he
had
never
had
direct
contact
with
the
person
that
he
claimed
was
petitioner.
as
he
testified,
he
had
merely
seen
that
person
around
and
in
some
unexplained
fashion,
unexplained
since
he
had
never
been
introduced
to
him
or
spoken
to
him,
he
knew
somehow
that
the
man
was
named
samuel
levine.
considering
that
this
was
27
years
after
casual
contact,
this
is
on
its
face
and
heroic
achievement
of
recollection.
particularly
since
morrow's
memory
was
admittedly
weak
on
matters
which
were
much
more
reasonable.
morrow
himself
admitted
that
he
was
not
positive
of
his
identification
but
said
and
i
quote,
“i
feel
i
saw
this
man
in
spain.”
but
the
difficulty
with
morrow's
testimony
goes
further
than
that.
before
the
hearing
at
which
morrow
testified,
he
had
been
interviewed
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
and
he
was
shown
this
passport
photograph
of
the
petitioner
which
had
been
on
the
passport
of
samuel
levine
and
morrow
hadn't
been
able
to
identify
the
petitioner
from
that
photograph.
although
obviously
that
photograph
was
a
better
likeness
of
the
petitioner
in
1938
and
the
petitioner
himself
was
in
1964.
furthermore,
when
morrow
was
interviewed
by
the
service
before
the
hearing
and
he
was
asked
about
joseph
sherman
or
samuel
levine,
he
couldn't
recall
either
name
much
less
recalled
that
this
was
a
person
he
had
seen
in
spain.
now,
he
suggested
that
perhaps
the
subject
of
the
passport
photograph,
he
suggested
in
the
interview
that
perhaps
the
subject
of
the
passport
photograph
had
been
on
the
ship,
the
aquitania
on
which
he,
morrow
had
sailed
from
the
united
states
to
france
in
june
of
1937.
but
when
he
testified
at
the
hearing,
he
reversed
them
so.
this
time,
he
said,
the
petitioner
was
not
on
the
voyage
to
france
in
june
of
1937,
the
aquitania.
this
time
he
put
him
on
the
voyage
to
the
united
states
from
france
in
december
1938
on
the
steam-ship
ausonia.
now,
on
this
evidence
the
petitioner
was
ordered
to
deport
and
on
review
by
the
third
circuit
--
second
circuit,
i'm
sorry,
judges
waterman
and
smith
with
judge
friendly
dissenting,
set
aside
the
deportation
order
and
remanded
it
the
service.
they
held
that
is
the
majority
of
the
three-judge
panel
held
that
in
a
deportation
case
against
a
long
resident
alien,
such
as
the
petitioner,
the
service
is
obliged
to
prove
its
case
by
the
criminal
standard
of
proof
that
is
it
must
prove
the
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
since
the
standard
regularly
employed
in
deportation
proceedings
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
are
the
factfinders
is
that
deportability
merely
has
to
be
proven
by
a
preponderance
of
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence,
the
panel
vacated
the
deportation
order
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
service
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
higher
standard
of
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
judge
friendly
as
i
said,
the
senate,
he
was
sympathetic
as
he
said
to
the
idea
of
requiring
more
than
a
rare
preponderance
standard
in
cases
of
deportation
involving
the
resident
aliens.
but
he
felt
and
he
said
that
congress
had
foreclosed
the
matter
because
it
had
provided
a
standard
of
proof
for
the
service
in
the
administrative
deportation
hearing
by
sections
106
(a)
and
242
(b)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
these
two
sections
provide
in
substance
that
administrative
findings
of
deportability
are
valid
and
conclusive
if
and
only
if
these
findings
are
supported
by
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
the
two-court
majority
felt
that
those
two
sections
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
situation
because
they
related
only
to
a
judicial
review
and
were
simply
the
substantial
evidence
--
the
familiar
substantial
evidence
standard
for
judicial
review.
the
government
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
second
circuit
took
the
case
en
banc.
the
en
banc
court
reversed
the
panel
and
sustained
the
deportation
order
adapting
judge
friendly's
dissenting
opinion
of
the
panel.
judges
waterman
and
smith
dissented
that
hearing
to
their
original
opinion.
now,
as
the
case
was
decided
in
the
second
circuit,
the
focus
was
on
the
applicability
of
sections
242
(b)
and
106
(a)
of
the
act.
and
in
our
brief,
we
show
and
i
think
we
show
quite
conclusively
that
these
two
sections
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
both
on
the
basis
of
their
language,
their
legislative
history
and
their
administrative
interpretation.
on
all
three
bases,
it
is
clear
that
these
sections
merely
relate
to
the
standard
for
judicial
review
and
furthermore
they
relate
not
to
the
burden
of
proof
or
the
nature
of
the
burden
of
proof
but
rather
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
on
which
the
order
must
be
based.
now,
as
we
understand
the
government's
brief,
the
government
does
not
contend
otherwise,
it
does
not
contend
that
these
two
sections
do
apply
to
the
service
at
the
--
as
the
setting
a
standard
of
proof
what
they
must
do
with
the
deportation
hearing.
so
really,
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
argue
now
that
these
two
sections
are
not
in
terms
controlling.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
beg
your
pardon?
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
the
court
of
appeals
held
they
are
relevant.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
no,
the
court
of
appeals
held
they
were
controlling.
mr.
joseph
forer
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i
don't
--
we
disagree
with
that
and
we
think
we
have
demonstrated
why
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong.
i'm
just
saying
that
i'm
just
going
to
rely
in
my
brief
for
that
demonstration
to
convince
you
because
i
don't
think
that
the
government
disagrees
with
us,
so
i
don't
want
to
spend
my
time
on
oral
argument
on
a
point
that
at
least
i
think
i
can
just
rely
on
our
brief.
now,
the
government
does
try
to
draw
certain
inferences
and
say
that
the
existence
of
the
judicial
review
standard
has
an
influence
but
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
impossible
to
reason
backward
from
a
judicial
review
standard
as
to
what
is
the
standard
for
the
burden
of
proof
at
the
trial.
in
a
criminal
case,
on
judicial
review
the
jury's
verdict,
the
finding
of
guilt
has
to
stand
if
it
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence
as
that's
the
same
substantial
evidence
test
as
in
administrative
proceedings.
and
yet
the
standard
of
proof
at
the
criminal
trial
is
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
we
say
that
since
congress
has
not
fixed
the
standard
of
proof
and
since
at
the
administrative
proceeding
and
since
you
can't
reason
backward
from
the
judicial
standard
of
proof,
there
simply
is
no
statutory
standard
of
proof
and
that
means
that
the
standard
has
to
be
defined
by
the
judicial
system
and
ultimately
by
this
court.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
in
the
case
of
resident
aliens,
for
reasons
i
will
go
to
in
a
minute,
the
standards
should
be
either
that
of
the
criminal
standard
of
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
or
at
least
the
standard
which
the
court
has
created
in
denaturalization
cases
whereby
the
government
must
prove
lost
citizen
--
denaturalization
by
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence
beyond
a
mere
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
the
denaturalization
cases
as
well
as
in
other
kinds
of
cases
such
as
cancellation
of
land
grants,
the
court
required
compliance
with
this
higher
standard
of
proof
that
is
with
the
clear
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence
standard
which
is
of
course
a
higher
standard
than
the
traditional
civil
standard
of
preponderance
on
the
grounds
that
in
those
cases,
denaturalization
or
cancellation
of
land
patents
that
those
cases
involved
a
revocation
of
precious
rights
conferred
by
governmental
action.
now,
the
same
logic
obviously
applies
to
deportation
cases
against
resident
aliens.
resident
aliens
have
been
granted
by
governmental
action,
the
precious
right
to
reside
and
remain
in
this
country.
and
with
that
right
they
acquire
and
have
been
granted
a
whole
complex
of
other
rights
which
residents
of
this
country
have.
and
aliens
who
have
accepted
this
right
have
directed
the
course
of
their
lives
in
reliance
on
the
possession
of
these
rights.
so
that
if
you
take
the
logic
of
the
cases
involving
cancellation
of
other
governmental
grants,
at
least
the
denaturalization
standard
should
be
applied
to
deportation
cases
involving
aliens
who
have
been
admitted
for
permanent
resident.
but
we
think
that
there
are
still
other
reasons
for
requiring
a
higher
standard
than
the
preponderance
standard
and
that
these
reasons
call
for
adopting
the
criminal
stand.
and
this
we
think
because
in
several
respects
in
terms
of
its
consequences,
its
nature,
its
procedures,
deportation
cases
should
for
the
purposes
of
the
standard
of
proof
be
equated
with
criminal
cases.
now,
deportation
is
--
of
a
resident
alien
is
different
in
any
other
kind
of
administrative
or
civil
procedure.
because
that
deportation
is
a
deprivation
of
personal
liberty
and
it
is
one
which
in
many
cases
and
perhaps
most
cases
is
a
more
drastic
deprivation
of
liberty
for
the
alien
and
for
his
family
who
may
be
citizens,
then
the
usual
term
of
imprisonment.
now,
whatever
the
case
may
be
for
theoretical
constitutional
purpose,
realistically,
the
deportation
of
a
resident
alien
is
punishment
and
as
to
him,
that
is
punishment,
and
this
case
illustrates
that.
in
this
very
case,
the
government
is
seeking
to
uproot
a
man
who
has
lived
in
this
country
since
he
was
a
child
for
46
of
the
60
years.
his
family
is
here,
his
friends
are
here.
his
means
of
making
a
livelihood,
his
skills,
his
resources
and
ability
to
survive,
his
very
ability
to
communicate
and
the
only
language
he
knows,
these
depend
on
his
remaining
here
and
the
government
is
attempting
to
remove
him
from
this
environment
and
return
him
to
a
country
from
which
for
all
realistic
purposes,
he's
a
stranger.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
he
is
a
workman.
he
has
developed
worked
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
is
now
working
in
the
construction
industry.
i
do
not
know
the
exact
trade,
but
he
is
now
working
in
the
american
construction
industry,
at
different
times,
he's
a
garment
worker,
taxi
cab
driver.
and
his
work
now
involved
--
he
has
to
communicate
with
other
workers
and
he
can
communicate
with
other
workers
because
he
speaks
english.
his
job
was
here,
his
wife
was
here,
and
this
obviously
would
be
a
terrible
deprivation
to
send
him
back.
mr.
joseph
forer
this
is
--
well,
first
of
all,
this
is
not
an
exclusion
provision.
it
is
an
expulsion
provision.
i
mean
they
institute
a
proceeding
against
him
as
a
resident
alien.
secondly,
they
didn't
charge
him
with
a
fraudulent
entry,
in
which
case
incidentally
there
would
have
been
a
five-year
statute
limitation.
they
charged
him
with
entry
without
inspection
as
an
immigrant.
mr.
joseph
forer
in
1938.
he
originally
entered
1920.
there
is
no
question
that
entry
was
legal
and
he
was
inspected
and
he
was
admitted.
their
claim
is
that
he
left
the
country
in
1937
to
go
to
fight
in
spain
and
he
came
back
in
1938
posing
as
an
american
citizen.
and
it
is
that
entry
which
they
claim
a
proof,
it
is
that
entry
in
which
they
now
say
subjects
him
to
expulsion.
did
i
made
myself
clear,
justice
black?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
reason
for
not
wanting
him
back?
well,
it
isn't
--
i
don't
know.
there
is
no
indication
whether
they
wanted
him
back
or
not.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
know
that
they
had
any
objection.
we
don't
even
know
that
he
--
assuming
that
they
prove
that
he
left.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
would
have
--
i
mean
that
is
a
historic
fact
that
they
objected
to
--
people
going
to
fight
in
spain
and
especially
american
citizens.
of
course
this
man
was
not
an
american
citizen.
they
never
had
a
chance.
assuming
he
left,
assuming
their
theory
is
proved,
they
never
had
a
chance
to
indicate
that
they
had
an
objection
or
didn't
have
an
objection.
that's
their
complaint.
they
didn't
have
a
chance
to
inspect
him.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
man
who
testified
against
him
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
morrow
who
had
fought
in
spain
and
who
testified
that
he
had
seen
the
petitioner
in
spain.
mr.
joseph
forer
seen
him
in
spain,
yes.
and
as
i
say,
his
testimony
is
suspect
--
mr.
joseph
forer
morrow
was
in
spain.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
but
he
said
that
he
was
on
the
loyalist
side
and
not
on
the
franco
side
and
he
said
that
the
petitioner
was
on
the
franco
side.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
he
is
not
a
professional
informer.
the
service
apparently
went
around
looking
for
people
who
had
fought
in
spain.
they
had
a
clue
because
they
had
this
passport
of
a
samuel
levine
and
the
evidence
is
that
this
samuel
levine
whoever
he
is
had
been
in
barcelona
during
the
war
and
they
know
--
they
had
a
list
of
american
citizens
who
fought
for
the
loyalists
in
spain.
so
they
went
around
looking
for
some
veteran
of
the
civil
war
who
was
ready
to
testify
that
the
sherman
had
been
--
he
have
seen
the
sherman
in
spain.
they
finally
found
somebody
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
forer
the
record
doesn't
show,
but
i'm
sure.
mr.
joseph
forer
no
he's
not
a
professional
informer
unless
he'd
become
one
since.
he
was
not
a
professional
informer.
but
the
point
is
that
professional
informer
or
no
professional
informer,
he
started
out
knowing
nothing.
and
the
more
he
hunted
with
hounds,
the
more
he
acquired
the
ability
to
identify
the
hare.
now,
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
now,
because
of
the
severe
and
punitive
aspects
of
deportation,
this
court
in
jordan
against
the
de
george
applied
the
deportation
statute,
a
doctrine
which
otherwise
is
confined
to
criminal
statutes,
namely
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine.
so,
by
the
same
token,
it
seemed
to
us
the
court
can
logically
apply
the
criminal
standards
of
proof.
another
reason
aside
from
the
consequences
of
deportation
are
the
causes
of
deportation.
if
you
read
the
causes
which
are
listed
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
they
read
like
a
penal
code.
they
constitute
basically
a
catalogue
of
offenses.
many
of
which
are
supposed
to
show
moral
turpitude
or
danger
to
the
state.
moreover,
it's
an
unenlightened
kind
of
penal
code.
it
inflicts
banishment
for
trivial
matters
to
the
most
remote
conduct
and
even
is
adhered
to
offenses,
once
barred
by
statute
of
limitations
and
to
offenses
which
weren't
the
broad
of
all
offenses
at
the
time
they
were
committed.
and
what
point
is
the
really
punitive
aspect
of
deportation
as
opposed
to
its
ostensible
regulatory
aspect
is
that
many
of
the
causes,
perhaps
most
of
the
causes
of
deportation
have
no
reasonable
or
rational
relationship
to
the
avowed
regulatory
objective
of
deportation.
the
regulatory
objective
of
deportation,
the
thing
that
this
court
has
said
takes
it
out
of
requiring
the
criminal
--
the
constitutional
criminal
safeguard,
the
regulatory
aspects
is
that
the
united
states
is
just
getting
rid
of
somebody
who
is
--
of
an
alien
who
isn't
fit
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
residing
here.
but
actually,
nobody
makes
a
determination
of
fitness,
and
in
this
very
case,
who
could
make
a
rational
--
can
draw
a
rational
conclusion
that
the
petitioner's
unfit
to
live
in
this
country,
because
if
you
accept
everything
that
the
government
says
is
true,
in
1938,
because
he
wanted
to,
in
his
enthusiasm
to
risk
his
life
as
a
premature
anti-fascist
fighter,
he
cheated
on
getting
a
passport
and
entering
and
leaving
the
country.
this
is
some
30
years
ago.
in
its
procedures,
deportation
is
also
like
a
criminal
action.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
the
charge
is,
i
said,
assuming
everything
that
he
say
is
true
everything
and
not
even
more
than
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
charge
is
that
he
entered
without
inspection.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
he
entered,
i
suppose
you
could
evade
inspection
or
avoid
inspection
in
a
number
of
ways
(voice
overlap).
you
can
pretend
to
be
a
citizen
and
get
away
with
it,
you
can
hide
a
wheelbarrow
or
--
mr.
joseph
forer
they
claim.
they
think
they
have
proved
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
came
in
using
the
false
passport
and
thereby
evaded
inspection
as
an
alien.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
the
point.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
the
point.
now,
i've
talked
about
the
consequences
of
deportation
being
like
that,
a
crime,
i've
said
the
causes
of
deportation
are
analogous
but
the
causes
--
mr.
joseph
forer
what
did
you
say?
mr.
joseph
forer
oh,
no
question
about
it.
but
you
haven't
–
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
it
has
not.
mr.
joseph
forer
for
constitutional
purposes,
this
court
long
ago
decided
that
you
don't
have
indict
by
--
over
a
very
strong
dissent
that
justice
rutledge
for
example,
is
offering.
but
as
justice
jackson
said
in
the
spector
case,
who
said
that
these
administrative
determinations
have
been
sustained
as
constitutional
only
by
considering
them
as
not
inflicting
punishment.
but
the
more
we
go
on,
the
more
they
add
causes
of
deportation,
the
less
these
causes
have
to
with
do
with
the
ostensible
regulatory
purposes.
the
more
these
causes
become
retroactive,
he
says,
the
less
possible
it
becomes
--
to
give
any
logical
content
to
this
doctrine.
and
all
i'm
saying
now
is
that
if
--
maybe
it
is
a
civil,
and
unless
you
overrule
yourself
it
is
civil
for
the
purposes
--
for
constitutional
purposes,
you
care
free
now
to
develop
a
standard
of
proof.
and
the
standard
you
should
develop
and
i
won't
go
into
the
procedures,
but
the
procedures
as
you
know
can
involve
arrest,
supervision
and
so
forth,
considering
these
things,
it
would
be
reasonable
to
make
it
a
criminal
standard
or
at
the
very
least,
the
standard
of
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
it
is
just
--
i
don't
mean
reasonable,
i
mean
the
standard
of
the
denaturalization
case.
now,
it
is
just
simply
offensive
for
the
department
of
justice
to
be
able
to
use
the
same
standard
of
proof
to
destroy
a
man's
life
as
it
prevails
if
you're
trying
to
prove
in
some
small
court,
a
$100-court
case
of
a
sidewalk
slip,
or
a
bill
collection
claim
for
$35,
there's
nothing
new
with
the
courts
adopting
as
a
matter
of
judicial
policy
a
higher
standard
of
proof
and
preponderance
in
civil
cases
including
in
some
cases
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now
i've
mentioned
the
naturalization
cases,
cancellations
of
land
patents,
but
there's
a
whole
host
of
other
situations
in
which
the
english
and
american
common
law
courts
have
used
these
higher
standards.
whenever
fraud
is
involved,
proof
of
a
lost
will,
proof
of
parole
trust,
reformations
of
the
deed,
adultery,
illegitimacy
of
a
child
born
in
wedlock,
and
so
forth,
all
of
these
have
had
higher
standards
of
proof
than
the
traditional
civil
standard.
now,
this
country
is
a
country
of
aliens
and
the
children
and
grandchildren
of
aliens.
in
our
deportation
laws,
because
of
their
harshness,
all
of
which
are
illustrated
here,
their
harshness,
their
rationality,
we
have
in
a
sense
betrayed
our
heritage.
the
court
has
refused
to
confine
congress
as
to
its
power.
it's
refused
to
apply
substantive
due
process,
a
bill
of
attainder
clause,
ex
post
facto,
the
first
amendment,
and
so
forth.
but
it
has
not
refused
to
confine
the
service,
maybe
out
of
remorse
or
some
of
the
thing
it
has
allowed
congress
to
do.
what
we
are
asking
here
is
no
more
than
that
you
do
confine
the
service
to
the
point
where
this
man's
liberty
can
--
and
that
of
any
other
resident
alien
cannot
be
destroyed,
short
of
proof
which
is
more
than
the
bare
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
thank
you.
