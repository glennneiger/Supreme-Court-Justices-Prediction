chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
friend
who
brought
her
back
to
ohio
a
man
or
a
woman
--
the
one
she
was
living
with?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
session
if
she
just
engaged
in
prostitution
after
june
1st
that
she
would
not
be
deported
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
latest
date
you
say
that
she
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
attempted
to
approve
that
she
had
engaged
in
these
acts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
early
1958.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
she
working
at
some
other
job
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
october
‘57?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
she
working
all
the
time
as
a
waitress
between
april
and
june
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
should
it
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
three
words?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
three
words
that
you
used
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
were
they
put
in
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
probably
you'd
find
that
they
were
put
in
an
opinion
by
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
case
i
was
talking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
it
should
take
that
higher
degree
evidence
to
deport
a
person
than
to
denaturalize
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
i
can
understand
that
but
my
only
question
is,
do
you
contend
that
this
should
be
a
higher
degree
of
proof
in
naturalization
because
i
understood
you
concede
that
the
statute
in
the
cases
of
this
court
have
a
lesser
degree
on
a
criminal
case
than
denaturalization
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
beytagh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
beytagh,
should
we
consider
the
facts
of
this
case
only
after
june
of
1957
because
the
fact
that
the
law
apparently,
there
was
no
finding
that
that
was
actionable
before
that
because
of
the
coercion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
unless
they
do
find
that
she
committed
prostitution
between
those
dates
of
her
own
free
will,
it
wouldn't
be
an
inference
that
they
didn't
consider
that
in
determining
the
deportability?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
of
your
time
but
if
we're
going
to
find
that
this
--
that
any
standard
you
submit
by
the
government,
shouldn't
we
have
to
know
whether
they
did
consider
that
as
actionable
enough
the
time
between
april
and
june
1957?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
did
not?
they
did
or
did
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
10(i)
and
43
i
think.
it
is
cited
in
the
sherman
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you,
is
that
probative
that
someone
told
him
that
she
was
in
the
business.
