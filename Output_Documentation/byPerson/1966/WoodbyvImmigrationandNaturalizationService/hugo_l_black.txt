justice

l.
black
what
did
you
say
it
is
in
denaturalization
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
consider
that
a
heavier
burden
and
a
substantial
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
it's
always
been
held
in
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
it's
always
been
held
as
the
duty
of
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
rather
than
a
legislative?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
more
than
possible,
isn't
it?
it
could
be
done
by
the
legislature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what
you're
arguing
in
the
sense
of
legislature
has
not
--
said
to
us
to
use
the
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
those
mean
--
is
there
any
real
difference
between
them,
except
words?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
getting
support
from
that
tradition
of
idea
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
criminal
case
is
much
evident
in
a
similar
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
by
reason
of
consequences
here
that
you
should
establish
a
heavier
burden.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
idea
that
it
would
be
a
heavier
in
this
case
than
in
the
sherman
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
a
pretty
uncertain
rule
wouldn't
it
to
establish?
if
one
percent
that
based
on
the
fact
that
under
the
circumstances
of
each
particular
case,
you
decide
--
decides
there
what
should
be
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
it
be
a
more
solid
foundation
to
get
it
on
in
some
kind
of
basis
as
to
type
of
case
it
is
rather
than
the
infinite
shading
between
the
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
idea
that
this
is
a
deportation,
put
the
person
out
of
defense
who's
been
living
here?
isn't
that
a
pretty
good
briefing
to
have
the
person
who
came
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
to
draw
a
difference
between
a
person
who
is
to
be
deported
who's
been
living
here
for
40
years
and
the
one
who's
only
been
living
here
for
three
years
because
one
is
a
woman
and
she
was
a
prostitute,
you
don't
have
a
different
burden
of
proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
general
burden.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
position
is
as
i
understand
it
that
it
does
not
see
the
burden.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
therefore,
it's
left
open.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
the
--
as
i
recall
it
in
the
schneiderman
case
the
burden
that
was
put
there
was
said
that
could
be
a
heavier
burden
than
have
previously
existed
and
that
the
burden
would
be
half
way
between
perhaps
of
preponderance
and
the
criminal
offense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
that's
the
only
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
doesn't
sound
quite
from
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
have
to
be
considereed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
you
saying
again?
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
quite
right
to
settle
this
that
necessary
to
import
the
idea
of
duress
such
as
when
it
occurred
and
your
question
of
whether
a
woman
should
be
presumably
sent
out
of
the
country
is
caught
under
intense
economic
pressure
can
to
engage
in
prostitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
just
words
that
have
been
put
in
there
and
according
to
the
idea
to
call
it
duress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
quite
humorous
of
making
a
contract
for
something
over
that
kind
under
duress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
here,
which
is
a
kind
of
a
question
almost
of
equity
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
yeah.
that's
exactly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
exact
same
thing,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
she
admitted
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
his
skills,
what
are
his
skills?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
1920?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
their
reason
for
not
wanting
him
back
with
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
what
is
their
objection
for
coming
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
the
assuming.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
is
this
man
who
testified
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
seen
him
in
spain.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
in
spain?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
in
the
war
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
on
the
same
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
testified
here,
was
he
an
informer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
whether
this
is
the
only
one
he
has
testified
against?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
he
a
professional
or
is
he
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
you
pursue
this
one
man
for
years,
on
that
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
have
granted
without
even
verifying,
couldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
just
a
rule
but
you
don't
have
to
follow
it,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
