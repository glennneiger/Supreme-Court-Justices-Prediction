mr.
jacob
a.
myers
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
34-year-old
female
who
married
an
american
soldier
while
he
was
stationed
in
germany
in
1956.
they
had
one
child
while
they
were
living
together
in
germany.
the
petitioner's
husband
in
return
from
germany
to
harlan
county,
kentucky
which
was
his
parents
home
and
left
the
petitioner
and
their
infant
child
in
germany
for
a
period
of
approximately
a
year-and-a-half.
after
that
time,
the
petitioner
and
the
child
came
over
to
the
united
states
and
they
moved
to
harlan,
kentucky
with
her
husband.
they
resided
there
for
approximately
six
months
and
then
move
to
dayton,
ohio.
about
four
months
after
that,
which
was
sometime
in
august
of
1956,
they
had
a
second
child
that
was
born
approximately
four
months
premature.
about
four
months
after
that
which
would
be
somewhere
around
december,
the
petitioner
got
into
an
argument
with
her
husband,
he
took
her
and
put
her
on
a
bus
and
shipped
her
off
to
pennsylvania.
she
turned
around
as
soon
as
she
got
there
after
borrowing
money
from
a
friend
to
get
back,
arrived
in
dayton,
ohio
and
found
that
her
husband
had
taken
their
two
children
and
moved
back
to
the
family
homestead
in
kentucky.
she
was
without
funds.
she
couldn't
speak
english
at
the
time
and
then
she
went
to
work
5&10
cent
store.
after
that,
she
worked
in
a
5&10
cent
store
for
approximately
three
months
and
then
she
went
to
work
as
a
waitress
in
a
restaurant.
soon
after
she
went
to
work,
she
received
a
telephone
call
from
her
husband
who
is
in
kentucky,
stating
that
their
son
who
at
that
time
was
about
four
months
old
--
no,
it
would
have
been
about
seven
months
old
was
in
dire
need
of
a
brain
operation.
she
was
told
by
her
husband
that
the
child
could
not
have
the
operation
unless
he
had
$300.00
that
he
had
no
blue
cross
and
the
hospital
refused
to
operate
on
the
child
unless
she
had
the
money.
she
told
her
husband
that
she
had
no
way
of
getting
the
money
and
he
told
her,
“if
you're
a
mother
enough,
you'll
know
how
to
get
it.”
at
this
time,
the
petitioner
testified
that
she
was
told
and
she
did
believe
that
if
she
did
not
get
the
money,
the
child
would
die
as
a
result
of
this
because
she
could
--
because
the
child
would
not
have
an
operation.
the
next
day,
a
vacuum
cleaner
salesman
came
to
the
door
to
sell
her
a
vacuum
cleaner,
she
said,
i'm
sorry
i
can't
afford
a
vacuum
and
told
her,
she
told
him
the
sad
story.
he
said,
well,
i
know
how
i
can
get
you
the
money.
he
left
and
came
back
some
time
later
with
another
man
and
a
bottle
of
liquor,
they
took
some
pictures
of
her
and
apparently,
men
started
coming
to
her
apartment
the
next
day.
the
petitioner
testified
that
she
continued
to
engage
from
that
point
for
approximately
two
months
in
acts
of
prostitution
until
she
had
repaid
the
$300.00
that
she
got
from
this
vacuum
cleaner
salesman
by
the
name
of
tom
wally.
after
that,
she
tried
terminating
the
arrangement
with
him
when
she
repaid
him.
he
threatened
to
turn
it
over
to
the
police
and
the
immigration
authorities
even
in
view
of
that,
she
left
dayton
approximately
two
weeks
later
and
went
to
knoxville,
tennessee.
this
two-month
period
of
time
as
far
as
we
can
determine
is
approximately
from
april
1
until
june
1
of
1957.
she
then
went
approximately
june
1,
1957
to
knoxville,
tennessee
and
remained
there
until
the
4th
of
july
of
1957.
on
the
4th
of
july,
a
friend
of
the
petitioners
drove
down
from
dayton,
ohio,
picked
the
petitioner
up
and
brought
her
back
and
the
petitioner
resided
with
this
lady
from
the
4th
of
july
of
‘57
until
september
of
‘57
in
one
place
and
then
they
move
above
the
place
where
the
petitioner
was
working
in
september
‘57.
in
october
of
1957,
a
mr.
emercon
was
eating
dinner
in
the
restaurant
where
the
petitioner
was
working
and
mr.
emercon
was
told
by
his
dinner
companion
not
in
the
presence
of
the
petitioner
that
the
petitioner
was
quote
“in
the
business”.
this
is
in
october
of
1957.
mr.
emercon
then
met
the
petitioner
that
evening.
he
went
to
the
petitioner's
apartment,
they
talked
at
great
length.
she
told
him
this
whole
story.
he
explained
to
her
what
she
had
been
doing
and
everything
about
it.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
she
at
this
time
in
the
record
i
think
will
bear
this
out,
your
honor
that
she
did
not
recognize
what
she
had
been
doing
as
prostitution.
i
don't
know
what
she
did
recognize
it
as
but
she
did
not
recognize
it
as
prostitution.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
he
just
met
her
and
she
explained
the
story
about
the
child
needing
the
operation
and
entering
the
disarrangement
with
mr.
wally
paying
him
back
the
$300.00
and
terminating
the
arrangement
and
then
he
told
her,
i
imagine
what
the
consequences
of
it
could
be.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
a
woman,
a
mrs.
jackson.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
she
is
a
witness
and
her
testimony
appears
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
emercon
also
testified
at
the
hearing
that
he
dated
her,
went
with
the
petitioner
for
some
time,
was
engaged
to
her
and
was
willing
to
marry
her.
they
subsequently
did
no
get
married
because
mr.
emercon
at
this
time
had
been
in
the
middle
of
a
divorce
proceeding
for
three
years.
i
think
it
went
on
for
several
years
after
that.
the
petitioner's
husband
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
on
july
14th,
1957
which
was
some
six
months
after
this
occurrence.
the
petitioner's
children
are
presently
in
the
custody
of
the
grandparents
in
harlan
county,
kentucky
and
it
was
until
december
of
1965
that
we
were
able
to
get
visitation
rights
for
the
petitioner
with
the
children.
she
is
presently
working
as
a
hostess
in
cincinnati.
the
questions
--
there
are
two
questions
basically
that
are
raised
in
this.
the
first
question
is,
were
the
decisions
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
special
inquiry
officer,
supported
by
a
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
of
evidence
similar
to
the
sherman
case
and
parenthetically,
what
do
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
mean?
the
second
question
that
is
raised
is
did
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
abused
its
discretion
or
commit
error
by
not
returning
the
case
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
to
adduce
additional
evidence
as
requested.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
believe
in
the
government's
brief,
your
honor,
they
have
conceded
that
it
is
timely.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes,
in
a
footnote
citing
--
i
don't
--
i
don't.
it's
footnote
3
on
page
8.
the
government's
brief,
they
have
conceded
that
there
was
a
timely
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
so
that
question
is
not
raised
in
this
hearing.
the
statutes
involve
the
section
242(b)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
provides
that
no
decision
of
the
portability
shall
be
valid
unless
it
is
based
upon
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence
and
then
also
section
106(a)(4)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
provides
that
the
petition
shall
be
determined
solely
upon
the
administrative
record
upon
which
the
deportation
order
is
based
and
the
attorney
general's
finding
of
facts
if
supported
by
a
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
it
will
be
necessary
in
this
case
to
not
only
discuss
our
brief
and
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
but
also
the
government's
brief
as
filed
in
the
sherman
case
because
the
government
in
this
--
in
the
woodby
case
has
incorporated
by
reference
the
entire
brief
that
they
filed
in
the
sherman
case.
in
order
to
have
a
proper
prospective
of
this
case,
it's
necessary
to
divide
the
periods
of
time
into
two
separate
parts.
the
first
period
of
time
commences
approximately
april
1,
1957
and
terminates
approximately
june
1,
1957.
it
was
during
this
period
of
time
that
the
petitioner
admits
having
engaged
in
the
acts
of
prostitution.
now,
the
second
period
of
time
begins
at
the
end
of
the
first
period
of
time
which
is
june
1,
1957
and
continues
until
some
time
in
1958.
now,
it's
during
the
second
period
of
time
that
the
government
found
that
the
petitioner
did
in
fact
engaged
in
prostitution
where
the
petitioner
denied
these
facts.
now,
as
far
as
the
first
period
of
time
is
concerned,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
stated
that
even
if
accepting
duress
as
a
defense,
we
find
that
the
petitioner
did
engage
in
acts
of
prostitution
after
june
1,
1957
so
we're
concerned
in
this
case
with
the
second
period
of
time
with
one,
did
she
in
fact
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution
after
june
1,
1957?
what
evidence
was
there
to
show
that
she
did?
and
number
two,
what
standards
were
used
by
the
court
to
determine?
now
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
from
my
reading
of
the
decisions,
i
would
say
--
excuse
me.
from
my
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
also
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
i
would
say
yes
that
she
was
not
be
a
subject
to
deportation
if
she
did
not
engaged
in
any
acts
of
prostitution
after
june
1,
1957.
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
it
seems
to
me
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that
there
is
a
concession
in
their
decision
that
there
wasn't
duress
during
this
first
period
of
time.
they
do
not
find
that
there
is
not
an
arrest,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
that
there
are
discrepancies
in
the
testimony.
the
petitioner
has
related
the
termination
of
acts
of
prostitution
to
the
repayment
of
the
$300.00.
the
hearing
before
the
special
inquiry
officer,
took
place
early
in
1962
where
these
acts
of
prostitution
took
place
early
in
1957.
this
is
approximately
five
years
later
and
if
you
read
the
decision
of
the
special
inquiry
officer,
it's
almost
nit
picking
as
to
dates
and
not
an
nit
picking
as
to
times
and
places.
there
were
certain--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
that
she
admits?
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
they
say
up
until
early
1958.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
the
only
evidence
of
prostitution
in
this
entire
case
came
from
admissions
by
the
petitioner.
there
were
no
witnesses
brought
by
the
government
who
proved
any
acts
of
prostitution.
the
petitioner
admitted
engaging
in
acts
of
prostitution.
she
first
gave
a
statement
and
in
that
statement,
the
first
part
of
the
statement
that
she
gave,
she
first
denied
it
and
then
she
said,
i
have
to
tell
the
truth
and
she
told
the
truth
as
to
one
engaging
in
acts
of
prostitution
and
why
she
did
engage
in
acts
of
prostitution.
now,
mr.
emercon
also
came
in
as
a
witness
for
the
government
and
the
decision
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
said
that
the
petitioner
was
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution
at
least
until
she
met
mr.
emercon
because
he
met
her
in
october
of
1957
and
mr.
emercon
was
told
by
a
dinner
companion
that
the
petitioner
was
in
the
business.
now,
the
petitioner
wasn't
there
and
this
type
of
evidence
is
considered
hearsay
evidence
at
best
that
couldn't
have
been
any
rebuttal
of
it
and
then
mr.
emercon
found
out
that
the
petitioner
was
not
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution.
now,
based
upon
this
fact,
they
said
that
the
petitioner
was
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution
until
this
date,
october
‘57
and
the
special
inquiry
officer
on
page
78
of
the
record
found
that
mr.
emercon
was
wrong.
it
wasn't
october
‘57
it
had
to
be
october
‘58.
now,
mr.
emercon
testified
it
was
october
‘57
but
the
special
inquiry
officer
said,
no,
it
was
october
‘58
and
again,
we
find
out
how
he
determined
that
it
was
october
‘58,
it
was
by
the
one
statement
that
the
petitioner
stated
that
she
lived
in
a
summit
court
apartment
for
approximately
a
year-and-a-half
and
this
is
on
page
78
of
the
record
and
then
they
refer
to
exhibit
2,
pages
3
and
4
which
is
page
12
of
the
record.
if
we
look
back
to
page
12
of
the
record
to
determine
what
the
year-and-a-half
was,
the
question
was
this,
do
you
recall
the
address
on
summit
street.
answer
-
salerno
street.
question
-
how
long
did
you
reside
there?
answer
-
one-and-a-half
years.
now,
i've
read
this
record
possibly
30
or
40
times
and
i
can't
figure
out
with
her
the
answer
one-and-a-half
year
whether
that
means
that
she
resided
on
salerno
street
for
one-and-a-half
year
or
on
summit
street
for
one-and-a-half
years
and
it
doesn't
say
when
it
commenced
or
when
it
seized
yet
based
upon
this
answer,
where
the
woman
who
could
barely
speak
english,
the
special
inquiry
officer
found
that
the
petitioner
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution
until
some
time
in
1958.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
she
was
working
as
a
waitress
in
the
restaurant
and
the
--
mr.
emercon
came
into
the
restaurant
where
she
was
working.
she
was
then
living
above
the
restaurant
in
an
apartment
with
his
friend.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes
sir.
now,
the
question
then
that
comes
up
in
this
case
is
what
standard
are
we
using?
what
do
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
mean?
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
in
the
gastellum
case
at
374
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
substantial
was
more
than
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
rowoldt
versus
perfetto
at
355
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
a
solidity
of
proof
is
required
in
a
judgment
entailing
the
consequences
of
deportation.
in
denaturalization
cases
the
statute
requires
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence.
in
a
criminal
case,
it's
evidence
beyond
unreasonable
doubt.
now,
the
question
arises,
does
this
court
have
the
right
to
establish
a
higher
standard
of
proof
than
a
--
why
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
which
is
the
equitable
standard
of
the
project.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes,
there
are
three
--
i
would
say
there
are
three
--
yes.
there
are
three
burdens,
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
the
least
burden,
the
middle
burden
which
is
the
fraud
type
of
burden
is
by
a
preponderance
of
the
--
excuse
me.
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
and
then
the
heaviest
burden
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
criminal
burden.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
if
i
may.
i'm
just
coming
to
that.
section
8
u.s.c
1105(a)(4)
provides
that
the
finding
of
deportability
shall
be
based
upon
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence
on
the
record
considered
as
a
whole.
now,
the
government
contends
that
this
section
therefore
prohibits
the
use
of
either
of
the
other
two
standards
which
would
be
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
or
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
they
say
that
this
statute
sets
the
standard
as
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative.
now,
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative,
this
phrase
refers
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
and
not
to
a
burden
of
proof.
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
deportation
case
and
this
is
submitted
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
sherman
case.
they
have
held
that
there
is
no
place
in
the
deportation
code
is
stated,
who
was
the
burden
of
proof.
they
concede
that
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
who
has
the
burden
of
proof.
if
it
is
conceded
that
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
the
statute
is
also
silent
as
to
what
the
burden
of
proof
is.
that
is
either
clear
and
convincing
or
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
is
always
been
a
function
of
this
court
to
determine
what
a
burden
or
what
burden
or
degree
of
persuasion
is
to
be
required
in
a
particular
case
and
this
degree
or
burden
of
persuasion
would
depend
upon
the
type
of
case
that
you're
dealing
with.
that
is
whether
it
be
a
criminal
case,
whether
it
be
a
type
of
a
deportation
case
and
what
effect
it
would
have
upon
the
person
and
what
the
causes
of
deportation
are.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
excuse
me.
i'm
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i'm
sorry.
i
meant
“a
court”
and
not
necessarily
this
court.
this
is
always
been
a
judicial
function
to
establish
what
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
it's
possible
that
it
could
be
a
legislative
function
but
in
this
instance,
the
legislation
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
it
could
be,
yes
sir.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes
sir.
since
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
referred
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
produced,
this
phrase
is
obviously
intended
to
refer
to
the
standard
to
be
used
on
review
to
determine
if
the
special
inquiry
officer
used
the
correct
burden
of
persuasion
and
that
is
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
or
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
--
or
by
a
preponderance.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
feel
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference.
if
you're
using
the
standard
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
this
would
mean
that
there
is
just
a
little
more
weight
of
evidence
on
one
side
than
on
the
other.
we
have
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
if
it's
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
this
means
almost
certainly
true.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes
sir.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i'm
saying
that
there
are
more
reasons
than
that.
i'm
saying
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
the
other
reasons
would
be,
one,
you're
dealing
with
a
--
let's
say
we've
got
the
first
one
which
is
the
consequence,
the
deportation.
the
second
one
is
the
reason
for
deportation
by
finding,
it
would
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
make
a
finding
that
this
woman
is
a
prostitute.
now,
if
the
woman
is
a
prostitute,
this
is
the
same
as
making
a
criminal
finding
even
though
we're
not
saying
that
she
is
a
criminal,
we're
saying
you're
a
prostitute
and
therefore
we're
going
to
deport
you.
we're
going
to
take
you
away
from
your
children.
we're
going
to
send
you
back
to
a
country
where
you
haven't
been
for
12
years.
now,
in
the
--
it's
very
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
sherman
case,
the
government
has
argued
that
the
criminal
burden
should
not
be
used
in
that
case
because
there
is
no
criminal
stigma
involved.
well,
in
this
case,
there
is
a
criminal
stigma
involved.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
think
each
case
has
reasons
for
requiring
the
heavier
burden,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
think
we
have
a
pretty
uncertain
rule
now.
i
think
we're
sitting
with
a
board
--
the
board
of
immigration
service
where
they
have
the
special
inquiry
officer
that
works
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
the
hearing
officer
the
inquiry
officer
and
the
person
who
takes
down
the
testimony.
so
since
everybody
works
for
the
same
board
then
they
wouldn't
bring
the
action
unless
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
person
to
begin
with.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
need
some
protection
or
the
alien
need
some
protection.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
i
think
it
would
be
awfully
difficult
in
this
area
to
try
to
establish
that.
you
would
have
--
there
would
probably
no
two
cases
that
ever
arise
that
are
alike.for
instance,
in
this
case
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
feel
it
is.
i
feel
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
several
things.
we
have
in
addition
to
the
deportation,
you
got
a
woman
who
has
two
children
here.
you've
got
a
woman
who
--
you're
going
to
say,
well,
you're
a
prostitute.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
no,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
no,
i'm
saying
that
the
burden
should
be
the
same
in
these
two
cases.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
feel
that
it
should
be
the
criminal
burden
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
of
several
things
as
i
started
to
say
one
the
stigma
of
the
criminal
act.
there
is
no
difference
between
this
court
saying
that
petitioner,
you
are
guilty
of
acts
of
prostitution
and
therefore,
you're
going
to
be
deported
or
a
criminal
court
saying,
petitioner,
you're
guilty
of
acts
of
prostitution
and
therefore
we're
going
to
find
you
$100.00
and
suspend
it.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
there
is
no
discretionary
relief
that
we
can
find
that
is
available.
the
statute
and
this
is
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
that
she
hasn't
asked
for
discretionary
relief.
well,
if
you
read
the
statute,
a
person
must
in
order
to
have
--
to
be
able
to
obtain
discretionary
relief,
be
able
to
be
submitted
into
the
united
states
and
if
she
is
convicted
of
this
act
of
being
a
prostitute
or
found
to
as
guilty
of
acts
of
prostitution
after
that
duress
had
ended
then
she
is
not
subject
to
admission
into
the
united
states.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
if
you
read
the
statute,
if
a
person
engages
in
acts
of
prostitution
when
they're
14
years
old
and
if
they're
70
years
old,
they
are
not
admissible
and
similarly
the
same
is
in
the
sherman
case,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
on
this
one
act.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
my
feeling
is,
from
reading
the
statute
and
reading
the
cases
that
the
congress
has
not
set
the
standard
of
proof.
they
have
set
the
quality
of
the
evidence
to
be
reviewed
that
this
is
purely
the
appellate
function
when
looking
at
the
evidence,
was
the
evidence
that
was
heard
by
the
special
inquiry
officer,
using
the
proper
burden
was
this
supported
by
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
no
sir.
if
you
want
to
turn
the
coin
over
as
the
court
did
in
the
perfetto
case
and
the
rowoldt
case
or
excuse
me,
the
perfetto
case
and
the
gastelum
case.
i
feel
that
this
court
has
gone
most
of
the
way
by
possibly
saying
that
maybe
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
mean
more
than
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
without
actually
going
ahead
and
saying
in
a
deportation
case
what
they
really
mean.
they
have
stated
the
solidity
of
proof
is
required.
the
word
solidity
of
proof
is
not
found
in
any
of
the
text.
it's
not
found
in
any
test
that
has
been
used.
this
is
a
new
concept
and
if
it's
a
solidity
of
proof,
this
is
far
more
than
the
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence
that
the
government
claims
that
they
have.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
believe
the
denaturalization
statute
reads
differently
--
i
believe
that's
--
i
have
the
citation
but
i
believe
it
is
the
statutory
standard.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
pardon.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
know.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
the
schneiderman
case?
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
i
don't
feel
that
we
can
compare
the
two
and
to
say
that
one
is
clear
and
convincing
for
a
person
who
is
already
a
citizen
that
if
we're
going
to
try
to
take
their
citizenship
away
from
them,
it
should
be
clear
and
convincing
comparing
that
with
this
case
where
the
person
doesn't
have
their
citizenship
that
it
should
therefore
be
a
lesser
burden.
i
feel
that
it
has
to
be
looked
at
individually
to
determine
exactly
what
protection
a
person
is
going
to
be
afforded
in
every
instance.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
don't
think
it
should
take
possibly
a
higher
degree
but
i
feel
that
it
should
take
at
least
as
higher
degree
if
you're
going
to
ship
someone
back
to
another
country
whether
it
would
be
to
take
them
away
from
their
children
or
after
40
years,
they
shipped
them
away
from
their
family.
the
ultimate
effect
upon
the
person
is
no
different
whether
they're
a
citizen
or
not
a
citizen.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
have
a
difficult
time
equating
the
two
to
try
to
compare
one
to
say
one
should
have
a
lesser
degree
or
one
should
have
a
higher
degree
because
i
feel
it's
necessary
to
look
at
the
result
rather
than
just
the
intermediate
step
that
the
ties
in
effect
as
mr.
justice
brandies
said
in
an
opinion,
deportation
may
result
in
a
lost
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living.
it
may
result
in
the
loss
of
property
in
life.
and
this
is
in
a
deportation
case
in
--
with
this
type
of
an
effect,
i
feel
that
it
certainly
requires
a
higher
burden
than
has
been
used
in
the
past.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
that
is
correct.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
that
is
correct.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
34-year-old
female
who
married
an
american
soldier
while
he
was
stationed
in
germany
in
1956.
they
had
one
child
while
they
were
living
together
in
germany.
the
petitioner's
husband
in
return
from
germany
to
harlan
county,
kentucky
which
was
his
parents
home
and
left
the
petitioner
and
their
infant
child
in
germany
for
a
period
of
approximately
a
year-and-a-half.
after
that
time,
the
petitioner
and
the
child
came
over
to
the
united
states
and
they
moved
to
harlan,
kentucky
with
her
husband.
they
resided
there
for
approximately
six
months
and
then
move
to
dayton,
ohio.
about
four
months
after
that,
which
was
sometime
in
august
of
1956,
they
had
a
second
child
that
was
born
approximately
four
months
premature.
about
four
months
after
that
which
would
be
somewhere
around
december,
the
petitioner
got
into
an
argument
with
her
husband,
he
took
her
and
put
her
on
a
bus
and
shipped
her
off
to
pennsylvania.
she
turned
around
as
soon
as
she
got
there
after
borrowing
money
from
a
friend
to
get
back,
arrived
in
dayton,
ohio
and
found
that
her
husband
had
taken
their
two
children
and
moved
back
to
the
family
homestead
in
kentucky.
she
was
without
funds.
she
couldn't
speak
english
at
the
time
and
then
she
went
to
work
5&10
cent
store.
after
that,
she
worked
in
a
5&10
cent
store
for
approximately
three
months
and
then
she
went
to
work
as
a
waitress
in
a
restaurant.
soon
after
she
went
to
work,
she
received
a
telephone
call
from
her
husband
who
is
in
kentucky,
stating
that
their
son
who
at
that
time
was
about
four
months
old
--
no,
it
would
have
been
about
seven
months
old
was
in
dire
need
of
a
brain
operation.
she
was
told
by
her
husband
that
the
child
could
not
have
the
operation
unless
he
had
$300.00
that
he
had
no
blue
cross
and
the
hospital
refused
to
operate
on
the
child
unless
she
had
the
money.
she
told
her
husband
that
she
had
no
way
of
getting
the
money
and
he
told
her,
“if
you're
a
mother
enough,
you'll
know
how
to
get
it.”
at
this
time,
the
petitioner
testified
that
she
was
told
and
she
did
believe
that
if
she
did
not
get
the
money,
the
child
would
die
as
a
result
of
this
because
she
could
--
because
the
child
would
not
have
an
operation.
the
next
day,
a
vacuum
cleaner
salesman
came
to
the
door
to
sell
her
a
vacuum
cleaner,
she
said,
i'm
sorry
i
can't
afford
a
vacuum
and
told
her,
she
told
him
the
sad
story.
he
said,
well,
i
know
how
i
can
get
you
the
money.
he
left
and
came
back
some
time
later
with
another
man
and
a
bottle
of
liquor,
they
took
some
pictures
of
her
and
apparently,
men
started
coming
to
her
apartment
the
next
day.
the
petitioner
testified
that
she
continued
to
engage
from
that
point
for
approximately
two
months
in
acts
of
prostitution
until
she
had
repaid
the
$300.00
that
she
got
from
this
vacuum
cleaner
salesman
by
the
name
of
tom
wally.
after
that,
she
tried
terminating
the
arrangement
with
him
when
she
repaid
him.
he
threatened
to
turn
it
over
to
the
police
and
the
immigration
authorities
even
in
view
of
that,
she
left
dayton
approximately
two
weeks
later
and
went
to
knoxville,
tennessee.
this
two-month
period
of
time
as
far
as
we
can
determine
is
approximately
from
april
1
until
june
1
of
1957.
she
then
went
approximately
june
1,
1957
to
knoxville,
tennessee
and
remained
there
until
the
4th
of
july
of
1957.
on
the
4th
of
july,
a
friend
of
the
petitioners
drove
down
from
dayton,
ohio,
picked
the
petitioner
up
and
brought
her
back
and
the
petitioner
resided
with
this
lady
from
the
4th
of
july
of
‘57
until
september
of
‘57
in
one
place
and
then
they
move
above
the
place
where
the
petitioner
was
working
in
september
‘57.
in
october
of
1957,
a
mr.
emercon
was
eating
dinner
in
the
restaurant
where
the
petitioner
was
working
and
mr.
emercon
was
told
by
his
dinner
companion
not
in
the
presence
of
the
petitioner
that
the
petitioner
was
quote
“in
the
business”.
this
is
in
october
of
1957.
mr.
emercon
then
met
the
petitioner
that
evening.
he
went
to
the
petitioner's
apartment,
they
talked
at
great
length.
she
told
him
this
whole
story.
he
explained
to
her
what
she
had
been
doing
and
everything
about
it.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
she
at
this
time
in
the
record
i
think
will
bear
this
out,
your
honor
that
she
did
not
recognize
what
she
had
been
doing
as
prostitution.
i
don't
know
what
she
did
recognize
it
as
but
she
did
not
recognize
it
as
prostitution.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
he
just
met
her
and
she
explained
the
story
about
the
child
needing
the
operation
and
entering
the
disarrangement
with
mr.
wally
paying
him
back
the
$300.00
and
terminating
the
arrangement
and
then
he
told
her,
i
imagine
what
the
consequences
of
it
could
be.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
a
woman,
a
mrs.
jackson.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
she
is
a
witness
and
her
testimony
appears
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
emercon
also
testified
at
the
hearing
that
he
dated
her,
went
with
the
petitioner
for
some
time,
was
engaged
to
her
and
was
willing
to
marry
her.
they
subsequently
did
no
get
married
because
mr.
emercon
at
this
time
had
been
in
the
middle
of
a
divorce
proceeding
for
three
years.
i
think
it
went
on
for
several
years
after
that.
the
petitioner's
husband
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
on
july
14th,
1957
which
was
some
six
months
after
this
occurrence.
the
petitioner's
children
are
presently
in
the
custody
of
the
grandparents
in
harlan
county,
kentucky
and
it
was
until
december
of
1965
that
we
were
able
to
get
visitation
rights
for
the
petitioner
with
the
children.
she
is
presently
working
as
a
hostess
in
cincinnati.
the
questions
--
there
are
two
questions
basically
that
are
raised
in
this.
the
first
question
is,
were
the
decisions
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
special
inquiry
officer,
supported
by
a
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
of
evidence
similar
to
the
sherman
case
and
parenthetically,
what
do
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
mean?
the
second
question
that
is
raised
is
did
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
abused
its
discretion
or
commit
error
by
not
returning
the
case
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
to
adduce
additional
evidence
as
requested.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
believe
in
the
government's
brief,
your
honor,
they
have
conceded
that
it
is
timely.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes,
in
a
footnote
citing
--
i
don't
--
i
don't.
it's
footnote
3
on
page
8.
the
government's
brief,
they
have
conceded
that
there
was
a
timely
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
so
that
question
is
not
raised
in
this
hearing.
the
statutes
involve
the
section
242(b)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
provides
that
no
decision
of
the
portability
shall
be
valid
unless
it
is
based
upon
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence
and
then
also
section
106(a)(4)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
provides
that
the
petition
shall
be
determined
solely
upon
the
administrative
record
upon
which
the
deportation
order
is
based
and
the
attorney
general's
finding
of
facts
if
supported
by
a
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
it
will
be
necessary
in
this
case
to
not
only
discuss
our
brief
and
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
but
also
the
government's
brief
as
filed
in
the
sherman
case
because
the
government
in
this
--
in
the
woodby
case
has
incorporated
by
reference
the
entire
brief
that
they
filed
in
the
sherman
case.
in
order
to
have
a
proper
prospective
of
this
case,
it's
necessary
to
divide
the
periods
of
time
into
two
separate
parts.
the
first
period
of
time
commences
approximately
april
1,
1957
and
terminates
approximately
june
1,
1957.
it
was
during
this
period
of
time
that
the
petitioner
admits
having
engaged
in
the
acts
of
prostitution.
now,
the
second
period
of
time
begins
at
the
end
of
the
first
period
of
time
which
is
june
1,
1957
and
continues
until
some
time
in
1958.
now,
it's
during
the
second
period
of
time
that
the
government
found
that
the
petitioner
did
in
fact
engaged
in
prostitution
where
the
petitioner
denied
these
facts.
now,
as
far
as
the
first
period
of
time
is
concerned,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
stated
that
even
if
accepting
duress
as
a
defense,
we
find
that
the
petitioner
did
engage
in
acts
of
prostitution
after
june
1,
1957
so
we're
concerned
in
this
case
with
the
second
period
of
time
with
one,
did
she
in
fact
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution
after
june
1,
1957?
what
evidence
was
there
to
show
that
she
did?
and
number
two,
what
standards
were
used
by
the
court
to
determine?
now
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
from
my
reading
of
the
decisions,
i
would
say
--
excuse
me.
from
my
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
also
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
i
would
say
yes
that
she
was
not
be
a
subject
to
deportation
if
she
did
not
engaged
in
any
acts
of
prostitution
after
june
1,
1957.
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
it
seems
to
me
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that
there
is
a
concession
in
their
decision
that
there
wasn't
duress
during
this
first
period
of
time.
they
do
not
find
that
there
is
not
an
arrest,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
that
there
are
discrepancies
in
the
testimony.
the
petitioner
has
related
the
termination
of
acts
of
prostitution
to
the
repayment
of
the
$300.00.
the
hearing
before
the
special
inquiry
officer,
took
place
early
in
1962
where
these
acts
of
prostitution
took
place
early
in
1957.
this
is
approximately
five
years
later
and
if
you
read
the
decision
of
the
special
inquiry
officer,
it's
almost
nit
picking
as
to
dates
and
not
an
nit
picking
as
to
times
and
places.
there
were
certain--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
that
she
admits?
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
they
say
up
until
early
1958.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
the
only
evidence
of
prostitution
in
this
entire
case
came
from
admissions
by
the
petitioner.
there
were
no
witnesses
brought
by
the
government
who
proved
any
acts
of
prostitution.
the
petitioner
admitted
engaging
in
acts
of
prostitution.
she
first
gave
a
statement
and
in
that
statement,
the
first
part
of
the
statement
that
she
gave,
she
first
denied
it
and
then
she
said,
i
have
to
tell
the
truth
and
she
told
the
truth
as
to
one
engaging
in
acts
of
prostitution
and
why
she
did
engage
in
acts
of
prostitution.
now,
mr.
emercon
also
came
in
as
a
witness
for
the
government
and
the
decision
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
said
that
the
petitioner
was
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution
at
least
until
she
met
mr.
emercon
because
he
met
her
in
october
of
1957
and
mr.
emercon
was
told
by
a
dinner
companion
that
the
petitioner
was
in
the
business.
now,
the
petitioner
wasn't
there
and
this
type
of
evidence
is
considered
hearsay
evidence
at
best
that
couldn't
have
been
any
rebuttal
of
it
and
then
mr.
emercon
found
out
that
the
petitioner
was
not
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution.
now,
based
upon
this
fact,
they
said
that
the
petitioner
was
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution
until
this
date,
october
‘57
and
the
special
inquiry
officer
on
page
78
of
the
record
found
that
mr.
emercon
was
wrong.
it
wasn't
october
‘57
it
had
to
be
october
‘58.
now,
mr.
emercon
testified
it
was
october
‘57
but
the
special
inquiry
officer
said,
no,
it
was
october
‘58
and
again,
we
find
out
how
he
determined
that
it
was
october
‘58,
it
was
by
the
one
statement
that
the
petitioner
stated
that
she
lived
in
a
summit
court
apartment
for
approximately
a
year-and-a-half
and
this
is
on
page
78
of
the
record
and
then
they
refer
to
exhibit
2,
pages
3
and
4
which
is
page
12
of
the
record.
if
we
look
back
to
page
12
of
the
record
to
determine
what
the
year-and-a-half
was,
the
question
was
this,
do
you
recall
the
address
on
summit
street.
answer
-
salerno
street.
question
-
how
long
did
you
reside
there?
answer
-
one-and-a-half
years.
now,
i've
read
this
record
possibly
30
or
40
times
and
i
can't
figure
out
with
her
the
answer
one-and-a-half
year
whether
that
means
that
she
resided
on
salerno
street
for
one-and-a-half
year
or
on
summit
street
for
one-and-a-half
years
and
it
doesn't
say
when
it
commenced
or
when
it
seized
yet
based
upon
this
answer,
where
the
woman
who
could
barely
speak
english,
the
special
inquiry
officer
found
that
the
petitioner
engaged
in
acts
of
prostitution
until
some
time
in
1958.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
she
was
working
as
a
waitress
in
the
restaurant
and
the
--
mr.
emercon
came
into
the
restaurant
where
she
was
working.
she
was
then
living
above
the
restaurant
in
an
apartment
with
his
friend.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes
sir.
now,
the
question
then
that
comes
up
in
this
case
is
what
standard
are
we
using?
what
do
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
mean?
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
in
the
gastellum
case
at
374
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
substantial
was
more
than
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
rowoldt
versus
perfetto
at
355
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
a
solidity
of
proof
is
required
in
a
judgment
entailing
the
consequences
of
deportation.
in
denaturalization
cases
the
statute
requires
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence.
in
a
criminal
case,
it's
evidence
beyond
unreasonable
doubt.
now,
the
question
arises,
does
this
court
have
the
right
to
establish
a
higher
standard
of
proof
than
a
--
why
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
which
is
the
equitable
standard
of
the
project.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes,
there
are
three
--
i
would
say
there
are
three
--
yes.
there
are
three
burdens,
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
the
least
burden,
the
middle
burden
which
is
the
fraud
type
of
burden
is
by
a
preponderance
of
the
--
excuse
me.
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
and
then
the
heaviest
burden
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
criminal
burden.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
if
i
may.
i'm
just
coming
to
that.
section
8
u.s.c
1105(a)(4)
provides
that
the
finding
of
deportability
shall
be
based
upon
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence
on
the
record
considered
as
a
whole.
now,
the
government
contends
that
this
section
therefore
prohibits
the
use
of
either
of
the
other
two
standards
which
would
be
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
or
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
they
say
that
this
statute
sets
the
standard
as
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative.
now,
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative,
this
phrase
refers
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
and
not
to
a
burden
of
proof.
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
deportation
case
and
this
is
submitted
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
sherman
case.
they
have
held
that
there
is
no
place
in
the
deportation
code
is
stated,
who
was
the
burden
of
proof.
they
concede
that
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
who
has
the
burden
of
proof.
if
it
is
conceded
that
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
the
statute
is
also
silent
as
to
what
the
burden
of
proof
is.
that
is
either
clear
and
convincing
or
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
is
always
been
a
function
of
this
court
to
determine
what
a
burden
or
what
burden
or
degree
of
persuasion
is
to
be
required
in
a
particular
case
and
this
degree
or
burden
of
persuasion
would
depend
upon
the
type
of
case
that
you're
dealing
with.
that
is
whether
it
be
a
criminal
case,
whether
it
be
a
type
of
a
deportation
case
and
what
effect
it
would
have
upon
the
person
and
what
the
causes
of
deportation
are.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
excuse
me.
i'm
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i'm
sorry.
i
meant
“a
court”
and
not
necessarily
this
court.
this
is
always
been
a
judicial
function
to
establish
what
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
it's
possible
that
it
could
be
a
legislative
function
but
in
this
instance,
the
legislation
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
it
could
be,
yes
sir.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes
sir.
since
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
referred
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
produced,
this
phrase
is
obviously
intended
to
refer
to
the
standard
to
be
used
on
review
to
determine
if
the
special
inquiry
officer
used
the
correct
burden
of
persuasion
and
that
is
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
or
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
--
or
by
a
preponderance.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
feel
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference.
if
you're
using
the
standard
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
this
would
mean
that
there
is
just
a
little
more
weight
of
evidence
on
one
side
than
on
the
other.
we
have
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
if
it's
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
this
means
almost
certainly
true.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes
sir.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i'm
saying
that
there
are
more
reasons
than
that.
i'm
saying
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
the
other
reasons
would
be,
one,
you're
dealing
with
a
--
let's
say
we've
got
the
first
one
which
is
the
consequence,
the
deportation.
the
second
one
is
the
reason
for
deportation
by
finding,
it
would
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
make
a
finding
that
this
woman
is
a
prostitute.
now,
if
the
woman
is
a
prostitute,
this
is
the
same
as
making
a
criminal
finding
even
though
we're
not
saying
that
she
is
a
criminal,
we're
saying
you're
a
prostitute
and
therefore
we're
going
to
deport
you.
we're
going
to
take
you
away
from
your
children.
we're
going
to
send
you
back
to
a
country
where
you
haven't
been
for
12
years.
now,
in
the
--
it's
very
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
sherman
case,
the
government
has
argued
that
the
criminal
burden
should
not
be
used
in
that
case
because
there
is
no
criminal
stigma
involved.
well,
in
this
case,
there
is
a
criminal
stigma
involved.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
think
each
case
has
reasons
for
requiring
the
heavier
burden,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
think
we
have
a
pretty
uncertain
rule
now.
i
think
we're
sitting
with
a
board
--
the
board
of
immigration
service
where
they
have
the
special
inquiry
officer
that
works
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
the
hearing
officer
the
inquiry
officer
and
the
person
who
takes
down
the
testimony.
so
since
everybody
works
for
the
same
board
then
they
wouldn't
bring
the
action
unless
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
person
to
begin
with.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
need
some
protection
or
the
alien
need
some
protection.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
i
think
it
would
be
awfully
difficult
in
this
area
to
try
to
establish
that.
you
would
have
--
there
would
probably
no
two
cases
that
ever
arise
that
are
alike.for
instance,
in
this
case
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
feel
it
is.
i
feel
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
several
things.
we
have
in
addition
to
the
deportation,
you
got
a
woman
who
has
two
children
here.
you've
got
a
woman
who
--
you're
going
to
say,
well,
you're
a
prostitute.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
no,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
no,
i'm
saying
that
the
burden
should
be
the
same
in
these
two
cases.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
feel
that
it
should
be
the
criminal
burden
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
of
several
things
as
i
started
to
say
one
the
stigma
of
the
criminal
act.
there
is
no
difference
between
this
court
saying
that
petitioner,
you
are
guilty
of
acts
of
prostitution
and
therefore,
you're
going
to
be
deported
or
a
criminal
court
saying,
petitioner,
you're
guilty
of
acts
of
prostitution
and
therefore
we're
going
to
find
you
$100.00
and
suspend
it.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
there
is
no
discretionary
relief
that
we
can
find
that
is
available.
the
statute
and
this
is
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
that
she
hasn't
asked
for
discretionary
relief.
well,
if
you
read
the
statute,
a
person
must
in
order
to
have
--
to
be
able
to
obtain
discretionary
relief,
be
able
to
be
submitted
into
the
united
states
and
if
she
is
convicted
of
this
act
of
being
a
prostitute
or
found
to
as
guilty
of
acts
of
prostitution
after
that
duress
had
ended
then
she
is
not
subject
to
admission
into
the
united
states.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
if
you
read
the
statute,
if
a
person
engages
in
acts
of
prostitution
when
they're
14
years
old
and
if
they're
70
years
old,
they
are
not
admissible
and
similarly
the
same
is
in
the
sherman
case,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
on
this
one
act.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
my
feeling
is,
from
reading
the
statute
and
reading
the
cases
that
the
congress
has
not
set
the
standard
of
proof.
they
have
set
the
quality
of
the
evidence
to
be
reviewed
that
this
is
purely
the
appellate
function
when
looking
at
the
evidence,
was
the
evidence
that
was
heard
by
the
special
inquiry
officer,
using
the
proper
burden
was
this
supported
by
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
no
sir.
if
you
want
to
turn
the
coin
over
as
the
court
did
in
the
perfetto
case
and
the
rowoldt
case
or
excuse
me,
the
perfetto
case
and
the
gastelum
case.
i
feel
that
this
court
has
gone
most
of
the
way
by
possibly
saying
that
maybe
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
mean
more
than
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
without
actually
going
ahead
and
saying
in
a
deportation
case
what
they
really
mean.
they
have
stated
the
solidity
of
proof
is
required.
the
word
solidity
of
proof
is
not
found
in
any
of
the
text.
it's
not
found
in
any
test
that
has
been
used.
this
is
a
new
concept
and
if
it's
a
solidity
of
proof,
this
is
far
more
than
the
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence
that
the
government
claims
that
they
have.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
believe
the
denaturalization
statute
reads
differently
--
i
believe
that's
--
i
have
the
citation
but
i
believe
it
is
the
statutory
standard.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
pardon.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
know.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
the
schneiderman
case?
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
well,
i
don't
feel
that
we
can
compare
the
two
and
to
say
that
one
is
clear
and
convincing
for
a
person
who
is
already
a
citizen
that
if
we're
going
to
try
to
take
their
citizenship
away
from
them,
it
should
be
clear
and
convincing
comparing
that
with
this
case
where
the
person
doesn't
have
their
citizenship
that
it
should
therefore
be
a
lesser
burden.
i
feel
that
it
has
to
be
looked
at
individually
to
determine
exactly
what
protection
a
person
is
going
to
be
afforded
in
every
instance.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
don't
think
it
should
take
possibly
a
higher
degree
but
i
feel
that
it
should
take
at
least
as
higher
degree
if
you're
going
to
ship
someone
back
to
another
country
whether
it
would
be
to
take
them
away
from
their
children
or
after
40
years,
they
shipped
them
away
from
their
family.
the
ultimate
effect
upon
the
person
is
no
different
whether
they're
a
citizen
or
not
a
citizen.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
i
have
a
difficult
time
equating
the
two
to
try
to
compare
one
to
say
one
should
have
a
lesser
degree
or
one
should
have
a
higher
degree
because
i
feel
it's
necessary
to
look
at
the
result
rather
than
just
the
intermediate
step
that
the
ties
in
effect
as
mr.
justice
brandies
said
in
an
opinion,
deportation
may
result
in
a
lost
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living.
it
may
result
in
the
loss
of
property
in
life.
and
this
is
in
a
deportation
case
in
--
with
this
type
of
an
effect,
i
feel
that
it
certainly
requires
a
higher
burden
than
has
been
used
in
the
past.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
that
is
correct.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
that
is
correct.
mr.
jacob
a.
myers
yes.
