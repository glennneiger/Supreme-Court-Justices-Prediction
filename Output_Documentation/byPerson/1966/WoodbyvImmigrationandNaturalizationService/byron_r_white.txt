where
does
the
statutory
standard
could
have?
justice
byron

white
or
preponderance.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
said
that
the
(inaudible).
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
your
colleague
--
assuming
the
previous
case,
indicated
that
it
would
be
the
standard
at
all
in
the
administrative
level
--
the
preponderance
--
are
you
saying
it
is
or
it
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
case
like
the
preponderance
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
this
case
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
was
the
clearing
officer
have
said
that
he
was
--
have
been
regarded
to
the
requirement
solidity
of
the
evidence.
justice
byron

white
is
that
in
the
sherman
case
here?
justice
byron

white
it's
at
page
9
of
the
petitioner's
brief
of
the
sherman
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
you
say
the
words
of
that
statute
reasonable
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
statute
was
probative
leaving
it
descriptive
of
the
extent
of
the
government's
burden
that's
been
filed.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
really
sounds
like
it's
addressed
to
a
review
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
where
do
you
get
your
preponderance
test?
justice
byron

white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
get
it
out
of
that
section.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
do
you
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
a
--
this
is
the
--
the
standard
then,
it's
judge-made
not
by
the
legislature.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
might
get
to
somewhere
in
terms
of
saying
it's
a
basic
preponderance.
it's
not
going
to
get
you
anywhere
in
terms
of
deciding
whether
in
terms
of
if
the
evidence
has
to
heavier
on
one
side
or
the
another,
how
much
have
used
and
the
other
side
says
that
there's
the
posture
of
the
burden
that
it
should
declare
but
didn't
say
it,
it
should
be
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
unreasonable
doubt.
justice
byron

where
did
the
court
get
the

what
is
the
rule
about
clear
and
convincing
come
from
in
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron

white
where
do
you
get
the
statute
that
because
there
is
a
burden
of
proof
that
the
standard
should
be
a
preponderance
rather
than
--
justice
byron

white
right.
great,
is
there
a
convincing
or
pre

justice
byron

white
but
aren't
we
reviewing
a
judgment
who
did
think
they
were
quite
relevant?
justice
byron

white
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
hold
them
to
be
relevant?
justice
byron

white
isn't
not
the
judgment
we're
reviewing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron

white
where
does
the
statutory
standard
could
have?
justice
byron

justice
byron

the
court
said
that
the

you

well
then,
