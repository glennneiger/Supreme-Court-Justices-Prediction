mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
question
presided
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
the
service
sufficiently
proved
that
the
petitioner
engaged
in
prostitution
after
entry
into
this
country
and
it
is
therefore
deportable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
statute
as
we
read
it
authorizes
the
deportation
of
aliens
who
engaged
in
prostitution
after
entry.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor
not
at
all
and
i
don't
mean
that
opening
statement
is
going
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
think
that
certainly
were
all
the
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
from
reading
the
opinions
both
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that
neither
one
of
them
said
to
themselves
before
they
decided
the
case
or
wrote
the
opinion,
what
degree
of
persuasion
do
i
have
to
have
in
order
to
reach
the
result
here.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that.
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
opinions
that
they
were
convinced
by
a
rather
high
degree
that
the
facts
that
were
found
were
true
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
has
indicated
in
the
sherman
case
that
the
statutory
standard
or
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence
was
utilized
here
by
the
factfinders.
i
think
their
decisions
were
made
against
that
background.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
that's
the
question
we
think
that
it's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
as
the
procedures
haven't
evolved
over
the
years,
they
have
been
developed
in
administrative
proceedings
generally
as
we
come
more
and
more
to
trial
type
hearings
in
a
deportation
cases
in
immigration
context
an
idea
of
a
degree
of
persuasion.
in
the
recent
case,
a
matter
of
a
parole
as
the
name
of
it,
the
inquiry
officer
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
stated
there
that
the
standard
of
persuasion
is
preponderance
of
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
cited
in
the
sherman
brief
that
we
filed,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
10(i)
and
43
i
believe.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
read
and
i
take
mr.
gordon's
comments
as
directed
toward
the
circumstances
that
exist
in
this
particular
case.
you
really
don't
get
to
a
preponderance
question
in
a
case
like
sherman
where
you
only
have
evidence
on
one
side.
you
simply
have
the
evidence
and
you
look
at
it
and
you
determine
whether
it
needs
to
borrow
the
standard
that
the
act
prescribes
and
i
think
that
we
have
a
different
situation
here
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
where
there
is
conflicting
evidence
that
i
personally
would
have
to
say
i
read
the
statutes
and
the
law
is
requiring
it
and
i
think
that
the
service
is
presently
applying
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
all
that
--
no,
your
honor,
that's
in
the
sherman.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
all
that
i
find
in
the
special
inquiry
officer's
opinion
and
this
is
in
response
also
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question.
he
said
he
found
the
chronology
of
events
decisive.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
said
it's
clear
that
the
petitioner
continued
to
engage
in
prostitution
after
the
period
of
alleged
arrest.
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
section
242(b)(4)
of
the
act
prescribes
the
standard
of
proof
required
of
the
service
in
deportation
proceedings
and
that
another
provision,
section
106
establishes
the
scope
of
judicial
review
applicable
in
such
cases.
we
feel
that
in
the
administrative
proceedings
here,
the
service
showed
by
at
least
a
preponderance
of
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
that
petitioner,
an
admitted
alien
had
engaged
in
prostitution
after
entry
and
without
reaching
the
question
of
the
validity
of
her
asserted
defense
of
duressthat
such
engagement
to
prostitution
continued
substantially
beyond
period
when
she
conceded
the
alleged
duresshave
terminated.
the
special
inquiry
officer's
determination
that
she
was
deportable
therefore
which
was
of
course
upheld
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
we
feel
is
proper.
since
that
determination
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record,
the
sixth
circuit,
we
feel,
is
correct
and
affirming
in
this
court
should
likewise
affirm.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
mr
chief
justice,
read
the
opinions
below
all
the
way
the
petitioner
apparently
reasoned.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
most
they
said
accepting
arguendo,
one
that
our
story
was
believable,
and
two,
that
it
made
out
adequately
a
duress
defense.
there
is
still
evidence
in
the
record
of
prostitution
apart
from
that
theory
so
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
fair
to
characterize
an
arguendo
acceptance
of
both
the
factual
and
illegal
proposition
as
being
tantamount
to
the
acceptance
of
the
validity
of
the
defense
in
the
truth
of
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
they
didn't
consider
it
because
they
found
it
unnecessary
to
do
so
under
the
circumstances
here.
that
there
are
more
difficult
admittedly,
legal
and
factual
questions
that
relate
to
that
period
and
i
think
that
they
determined
that
it
simply
wasn't
necessary
to
reach
them
because
there
was
evidence
of
activity
outside
of
the
period
of
duress.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
didn't
consider
that
actionable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
did
not
because
they
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
do
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
petitioner
filed
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
in
the
option.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
since
the
facts
here
are
obviously
subcritical,
i
would
like
to
briefly
consider
the
record
before
returning
to
the
legal
arguments
made
by
the
petitioner
and
raised
here.
i
should
note
that
we
take
a
radically
different
view
of
the
record
and
the
facts
here
than
does
the
petitioner.
indeed,
if
the
record
shows
the
facts
as
petitioner
feels
that
it
does,
i
think
the
government
wouldn't
be
here.
one
thing
upon
which
the
parties
do
agree
here,
however,
is
that
the
record
is
rather
confused
one.
we
agree
with
this
and
would
like
to
note
that
much
of
the
confusion
ever
resulted
from
a
number
in
inconsistencies
in
petitioner's
own
testimony.
indeed,
as
the
counsel
of
petitioner
noted
that
she
frankly
admitted
that
she
changed
her
story
at
one
point.
there
is
a
great
bit
of
confusion
about
dates
here.
the
petitioner
has
now
developed
what
appears
to
be
a
rather
plausible
handling
of
this
problem
of
dates
which
has
the
effect
of
telescoping
the
time
of
her
admitted
involvement
in
prostitution
insofar
as
it's
possible.
on
the
other
hand,
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
of
course
observed
the
witnesses
and
was
in
the
best
position
to
determine
their
credibility
found
the
facts
to
be
quite
different.
after
considering
the
testimony
and
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
and
all
the
surrounding
circumstances,
he
arrived
in
what
we
feel
to
be
a
most
plausible
and
probably
accurate
resolution
of
this
problem
of
confusion
particularly
as
to
dates
which
one
finds
in
the
record.
his
finding
that
petitioner's
engagement
in
prostitution
whatever
the
circumstances
of
its
commencement
continued
until
late
1958
and
not
1957
is
we
feel
amply
supported
in
the
record.
the
petitioner's
trip
in
knoxville
which
was
referred
to
previously
according
to
her
own
witness
mrs.
jackson
occurred
in
1958
and
not
1957.
the
petitioner's
husband
as
shown
by
the
record
in
the
kentucky
court
and
the
probative
custody
proceeding,
his
death
occurred
in
july
of
1958
or
1957.
the
petitioner
herself
stated
at
one
point
that
she
received
“gifts”
of
money
from
that
engaging
and
of
course
subsequent
to
learning
of
her
husband's
death
some
six
months
after
he
has
been
killed
and
at
an
apartment
by
the
way
that
she
moved
to
only
according
to
her
testimony
after
the
knoxville
trip.
other
testimony
we
feel
also
confirms
the
findings
as
to
dates
reached
by
the
special
inquiry
officer.
but
even
apart
from
his
findings,
once
here
in
fact
that
stands
out
clearly
from
the
record
is
that
petitioner
repeatedly
and
consistently
tied
the
determination
of
her
engagement
in
prostitution
to
her
meeting
this
mr.
anthony
emercon
whether
that
occurred
in
late
1958
or
as
early
as
late
1957.
in
the
circumstances
of
emercon
as
becoming
acquainted
with
petitioner,
confirmed
and
we
think
that
she
continued
to
engage
in
prostitution
at
least
at
the
very
least
until
meeting
him.
he
was
told
by
a
friend
who
said
that
he
had
relations
with
her
for
money
that
she
was
“in
the
business”.
now,
we
know
this
is
hearsay
and
so
did
everybody
below
but
hearsay
is
generally
admissible
in
administrative
proceedings
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
some
real
question
here
as
to
whether
it
might
not
have
been
admissible
judicially
under
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
but
anyhow,
he
went
to
her
apartment
for
the
purpose--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
probative
because
i
don't
think
people
generally
run
around
deporting
out
women
and
saying
things
like
this
about
them
if
there
isn't
some
substance.
emercon
went
to
her
apartment
as
the
record
shows
for
the
purpose
of
having
relations
with
her
although
he
states
that
he
could
not
go
through
with
it
but
left
$10.00
anyhow
or
probably
not
an
outstanding
alone
to
prove
that
she
was
then
engaging
to
prostitution.
this
evidence
we
feel
tends
to
strongly
corroborate
that
her
admitted
activity
continued
at
least
until
she
met
this
man.
at
the
earliest
under
any
view
of
the
record,
she
met
him
in
october
of
1957
at
least
six
months
after
the
time
that
she
herself
admits
that
the
prostitution
started.
the
inference
is
most
favorable
to
her
engaged
in
men
and
assuming
that
her
prostitution
started
in
april
and
not
february.
she
once
gave
an
affidavit
saying
that
it
started
in
february.
the
evidence
still
showed
an
engagement
of
prostitution
for
some
six
months
at
the
very
least.
only
two
months
of
which
are
accounted
for
by
the
alleged
arrest.
she
now
said
the
knoxville
trip
intervened
but
as
the
special
inquiry
also
found
it's
quite
likely
that
that
trip
did
not
occur
until
1958.
she
once
stated
that
she
spent
three
months
in
knoxville
but
under
a
present
view
of
what
happened,
she
could
have
been
there
no
longer
than
several
weeks.
she
started
working
for
the
vacuum
cleaner
salesman
in
april,
continued
for
two
months,
wanted
to
quit
but
continued
for
another
two
weeks
and
then
went
to
knoxville
to
get
away
returning
on
some
july
4.
parenthetically,
her
early
explanation
of
why
she
went
to
knoxville
that
mr.
wally
asked
her
to
go
there
to
practice
prostitution
and
that
she
was
evicted
from
her
apartment
because
another
girl
used
it
for
purposes
of
prostitution
it
seems
to
us
more
possible
just
as
it
seems
more
likely
that
the
knoxville
trip
did
not
occurred
in
198
and
that
she
had
engaged
in
prostitution
from
early
‘57
until
sometime
late
‘58.
in
any
event,
she
tied
the
end
of
her
prostitution
to
meeting
emercon
over
and
over
again
as
the
record
shows.
under
any
view
of
the
testimony,
this
could
not
have
occurred
until
late
1957
outside
of
the
period
of
the
alleged
duressthus
we
feel
the
government
showed
she
had
engaged
to
prostitution
even
apart
from
the
period
of
alleged
duressfor
substantial
period
of
time
in
1957.
in
addition,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
for
prostitution
in
early
1959,
no
charges
were
dropped
and
emercon
gave
a
statement
to
the
police
at
that
time
that
she
was
a
prostitute.
statement
which
she
says
was
untrue
and
was
given
to
help
her
retain
custody
of
her
daughter.
thus,
we
feel
the
evidence
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
emercon
said
it
was
not
true.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
gave
a
statement
admitting
that
she
was
engaging
in
prostitution
with
him
at
that
time
but
said
that
statement
was
untrue
because
there
was
something
about
protecting
her
daughter
because
the
police
were
going
to
take
it
that
he
didn't
give
any
statement
on
that.
that's
what
he
said.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
thus,
we
feel,
there's
at
least
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
her
engagement
continued
into
1959
even
in
that
so
far
in
two
months
that
she
admits.
now,
in
response
principally,
mr
chief
justice,
to
your
question,
her
duress
defense,
whatever
it's
merits
simply
doesn't
cover
the
ration
of
proven
engagement
in
prostitution
and
as
i
stated
contrary
to
her
session
the
factfinders
here
did
not
accepted
duress
offense
as
true.
rather
as
we
view
their
opinions
they
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
those
questions
or
to
decide
whether
her
story
should
be
believed
and
she
was
deportable
for
having
engaged
in
prostitution
outside
of
the
period.
now,
as
to
an
affirmative
defense
of
duress,
whoever
had
the
burden
of
proceeding
at
the
burden
on
proof
seems
to
ask
is
not
relevant
here
because
the
question
simply
never
arose.
even
assuming
that
the
government
had
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
once
the
defense
such
as
this
was
properly
raised,
that
burden
never
arose
here
because
her
evidence
that
she
produced
didn't
relate
wasn't
coextensive
with
the
period
of
her
engagement
in
prostitution
and
therefore,
the
prima
facie
case
which
deserve
as
it
made
out
was
not
refuted
and
they
did
not
need
to
rebut
that
evidence.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor
if
--
in
administrative
proceedings
and
litigation
generally,
defense
such
as
duress
is
generally
regarded
as
an
affirmative
defense
on
which
in
some
cases
the
person
asserting
the
defense
will
have
at
least
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
that's
generally
recognized
as
duress,
your
honor.
in
some
cases,
they'll
have
the
burden
of
--
ultimate
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue.
now,
here,
all
that
i'm
saying
is
this
question
is
--
simply
never
arose
here
because
even
though
she
did
produce
some
evidence
of
what
she
says
relates
to
duress,
the
government
did
not
need
to
attempt
to
rebut
that
evidence
if
it's
case
was
based
upon
--
could
be
based
upon
other
evidence
in
the
record,
evidence
apart
from
the
period
of
alleged
duress.
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
respect
to
the
factfinders'
view
of
her
story,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
have
they
found
it
necessary
to
pass
on
the
variety
of
the
story,
neither
the
special
inquiry
officer
nor
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
would
have
believed
them.
the
special
inquiry
officer
founded
a
hard
story
to
believe
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
stated
that
it
was
a
bizarre
story.
but
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
echoing
special
inquiry
officer
stated,
even
if
the
respondent's
story
is
to
be
believed,
even
it
be
considered
circumstances
under
which
she
entered
the
practice
prostitution
may
have
amounted
to
duress,
nevertheless
the
continuance
of
the
practice
until
at
least
1957,
late
1957
is
not
explained
cannot
be
dependent
on
the
ground
of
duress.
now,
just
several
words
about
the
adequacy
of
duress
defense
itself,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
rather
unusual
and
highly
attenuated
one.
it's
an
attempt
to
justify
on
the
grounds
principally
of
economic
duress
affirmative
misconduct.
now,
we
now
concede
that
in
some
limited
circumstances
there
maybe
an
adequate
defense
of
duress
under
such
condition.
the
courts
have
generally
carefully
scrutinized
such
alleged
duress
defense.
and
i
think
sociologist
would
probably
tell
us
that
most
prostitution
is
engaged
in
under
some
economic
duress.
now,
supposed
instead
of
deciding
to
engage
in
prostitution,
petitioner
decided
in
order
to
get
this
money
that
she
was
going
to
rob
a
bank
or
forge
a
check.
i
think
that
she
would
be
hard
pressed
to
maintain
that
the
circumstances
were
suppression
to
justify
her
activity
if
it
later
was
brought
a
proceeding
which
later
brought
against
deport.
falsely
analyzed
therefore
we've
been
able
to
hear
duress
defense
had
it
been
reached
and
if
you
reach
it
theoretically
it's
on
its
face
legally
inadequate
even
if
her
story
is
believed.
her
reliance
on
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
case
in
which
the
duress
defense
was
accepted
seems
to
us
wide
in
point.
that
case
was
a
rather
unusual
one.
the
girl
there
was
17
years
of
age,
she
was
held
in
custody
and
threatened
with
harm
that
she
didn't
brought
through
with
the
prostitution,
tried
to
escape
unsuccessfully
and
was
caught
continued
with
her
engagement
only
until
she
could
get
away
and
a
special
inquiry
officer
there
specifically
stated
that
he
found
her
story
completely
credible
and
believable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
what
the
story
is.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is.
there
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
long
subject
of
duress
in
something
other
than
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
analogizing
for
some
known
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
comes
pretty
close
to
that
but
that
has
to
be
based
of
course
on
credibility
of
her
story.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
think
--
i
think
i'd
say
essentially
though
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
state
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
words
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
have
meaning
more
intended
by
congress
to
have
meaning.
they
relate
to
quality
of
quantity
but
so
do
most
of
the
conventional
formulations
of
burden,
clear
and
convincing.
there
are
adjectives
that
attempt
to
describe
something
that's
very
difficult
to
describe.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
agree
generally.
it
seems
to
me
that
burden
on
the
service.
we
admit
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof
in
deportations
proceedings
and
in
view
this
statute
is
written
against
that
background
on
1952.
and
the
congress
used
these
words
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
to
tell
the
administrative
official
that
the
evidence
had
to
have
some
quality
to
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
it
relates
to
judiciary
review
as
has
been
argued,
it
seems
to
me
first
to
be
a
rather
strange
place
to
put
it
just
right
in
the
middle
of
a
long
statute
relating
to
proceedings
conducted
by
special
inquiry
officers.
second,
congress
apparently
didn't
feel
that
it
was
related
directed
towards
judiciary
review
because
in
1961
the
enacted
section
106
which
prescribes
a
standard
of
--
for
judiciary
review
in
courts
of
appeal.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
somewhat
superfluous
to
do
that
as
they
viewed
it
as
relating
only
to
judicial
review.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
there
have
been
a
few
isolated
cases
in
which
the
service
has
applied
a
higher
standard
than
preponderance
of
evidence
by
reasonable
substantial
probative
evidence.
the
cases
generally
involved
citizenship
clients
in
which
the
service
has
found
it
expedient
to
require
technically
as
to
a
claim
that
relates
to
an
event
long,
it
has
something
more
than
just
preponderance.
there
are
here
in
these
cases
that
are
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
within
the
attorney
general's
discretion
with
people
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
it
seems
to
me
the
problem
there
is
that
you're
talking
about
citizenship
matters
and
not
simply,
it
arises
in
a
deportation
proceedings
admittedly.
but
question
relates
to
citizenship
and
i
think
that
that's
been
the
impelling
back
which
led
them
to
require
a
higher
standard.
i
want
to
talk
for
a
couple
of
minutes
about
this
problem
of
burden
of
proof
and
degree
of
persuasion.
we
perceived
very
well
the
difference
and
the
distinction
between
the
location
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
one
or
the
other
person
who
whims
that
the
evidence
is
inactive
for
it
or
the
risk
of
non-persuasion
as
involved
and
the
degree
of
persuasion
or
conviction
which
a
factfinder
should
have
in
reaching
his
determinations
and
all
of
the
statutes
are
admittedly
not
explicit
on
this.
i
am
no
hesitancy
in
agreeing
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
deportation
cases
rest
upon
the
immigration
service.
and
it's
clear
to
me
that
section
242
has
prescribed
the
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence
standard
was
written
against
that
background.
the
congress
in
1952
made
specific
exceptions
by
placing
the
burden
of
proof
such
as
in
section
291
on
aliens
rather
than
on
the
government.
now,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me
that
specifically
place
it
on
someone
else
if
you're
not
assuming
that
it's
on
the
government
generally.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
fair
to
assume
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
burden
by
a
preponderance
of
the
quality
evidence
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
substantial
and
probative.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
talk
about
this
thing
that
the
trial
of
fact
has
to
be
convinced
that
it's
more
probably
true
than
not
in
this
case
the
petitioner
committed
acts
of
prostitution.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
caution
to
the
factfinder
that
the
evidence
has
to
be
of
a
certain
quality,
reasonable
substantial
and
probative.
so
i
think
this
court
in
rowoldt
and
gastelum
has
picked
this
language
up
not
only
language
of
judicial
review
but
used
it,
said
it
found
the
evidence
insignificantly
probative,
said
it
found
the
evidence
insubstantial.
it
seems
to
me
these
are
flexible
and
workable
terms
both
for
administrate
of
factfinding
and
for
judicial
review
and
there's
room
for
play
in
the
joints
and
hard
tuck
cases.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
where
do
i
get
it?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
and
leaves
on
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
true.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
and
we
have
these
three
conventional
formulations
that
we
talked
about,
i
think
it's
fair
for
the
board
to
assume
and
for
us
to
assume
the
congress
intended
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
the
congress
intended
that
that
was
a
standard
that
would
apply.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
someone
it
has
to
be
--
we
say
by
some
point
of
her
amount
it
seems
to
me
it's
fair
to
infer
that
congress
not
having
said
anything
about
it
intended
that
that
person
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place
denaturalization
proceedings
are
court
proceedings
and
this
court
exercising
its
supervisory
power
over
the
court
in
an
area
in
which
congress
cannot
specifically
acted
by
statute
prescribed
that
standard
because
of
the
considerations
involved.
that's
the
traditional
broad
standard
and
it
seems
to
us
to
make
immanently
good
sense
because
generally,
attempt
to
take
away
a
right
to
confer,
the
vested
rights
such
as
citizenship
by
naturalization
is
based
upon
broad
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
get
that
out
of
the
statute.
i
think
it's
a
fair
interest
that
that's
what
the
congress
intended.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
we
understand.
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
against
the
background
of
congressional
intent
and
enacting
in
1952
act
with
a
standard
for
the
following.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
question
presided
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
the
service
sufficiently
proved
that
the
petitioner
engaged
in
prostitution
after
entry
into
this
country
and
it
is
therefore
deportable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
statute
as
we
read
it
authorizes
the
deportation
of
aliens
who
engaged
in
prostitution
after
entry.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor
not
at
all
and
i
don't
mean
that
opening
statement
is
going
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
think
that
certainly
were
all
the
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
from
reading
the
opinions
both
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that
neither
one
of
them
said
to
themselves
before
they
decided
the
case
or
wrote
the
opinion,
what
degree
of
persuasion
do
i
have
to
have
in
order
to
reach
the
result
here.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that.
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
opinions
that
they
were
convinced
by
a
rather
high
degree
that
the
facts
that
were
found
were
true
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
has
indicated
in
the
sherman
case
that
the
statutory
standard
or
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence
was
utilized
here
by
the
factfinders.
i
think
their
decisions
were
made
against
that
background.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
that's
the
question
we
think
that
it's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
as
the
procedures
haven't
evolved
over
the
years,
they
have
been
developed
in
administrative
proceedings
generally
as
we
come
more
and
more
to
trial
type
hearings
in
a
deportation
cases
in
immigration
context
an
idea
of
a
degree
of
persuasion.
in
the
recent
case,
a
matter
of
a
parole
as
the
name
of
it,
the
inquiry
officer
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
stated
there
that
the
standard
of
persuasion
is
preponderance
of
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
cited
in
the
sherman
brief
that
we
filed,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
10(i)
and
43
i
believe.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
read
and
i
take
mr.
gordon's
comments
as
directed
toward
the
circumstances
that
exist
in
this
particular
case.
you
really
don't
get
to
a
preponderance
question
in
a
case
like
sherman
where
you
only
have
evidence
on
one
side.
you
simply
have
the
evidence
and
you
look
at
it
and
you
determine
whether
it
needs
to
borrow
the
standard
that
the
act
prescribes
and
i
think
that
we
have
a
different
situation
here
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
where
there
is
conflicting
evidence
that
i
personally
would
have
to
say
i
read
the
statutes
and
the
law
is
requiring
it
and
i
think
that
the
service
is
presently
applying
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
all
that
--
no,
your
honor,
that's
in
the
sherman.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
all
that
i
find
in
the
special
inquiry
officer's
opinion
and
this
is
in
response
also
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question.
he
said
he
found
the
chronology
of
events
decisive.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
said
it's
clear
that
the
petitioner
continued
to
engage
in
prostitution
after
the
period
of
alleged
arrest.
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
section
242(b)(4)
of
the
act
prescribes
the
standard
of
proof
required
of
the
service
in
deportation
proceedings
and
that
another
provision,
section
106
establishes
the
scope
of
judicial
review
applicable
in
such
cases.
we
feel
that
in
the
administrative
proceedings
here,
the
service
showed
by
at
least
a
preponderance
of
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
that
petitioner,
an
admitted
alien
had
engaged
in
prostitution
after
entry
and
without
reaching
the
question
of
the
validity
of
her
asserted
defense
of
duressthat
such
engagement
to
prostitution
continued
substantially
beyond
period
when
she
conceded
the
alleged
duresshave
terminated.
the
special
inquiry
officer's
determination
that
she
was
deportable
therefore
which
was
of
course
upheld
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
we
feel
is
proper.
since
that
determination
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record,
the
sixth
circuit,
we
feel,
is
correct
and
affirming
in
this
court
should
likewise
affirm.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
mr
chief
justice,
read
the
opinions
below
all
the
way
the
petitioner
apparently
reasoned.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
most
they
said
accepting
arguendo,
one
that
our
story
was
believable,
and
two,
that
it
made
out
adequately
a
duress
defense.
there
is
still
evidence
in
the
record
of
prostitution
apart
from
that
theory
so
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
fair
to
characterize
an
arguendo
acceptance
of
both
the
factual
and
illegal
proposition
as
being
tantamount
to
the
acceptance
of
the
validity
of
the
defense
in
the
truth
of
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
they
didn't
consider
it
because
they
found
it
unnecessary
to
do
so
under
the
circumstances
here.
that
there
are
more
difficult
admittedly,
legal
and
factual
questions
that
relate
to
that
period
and
i
think
that
they
determined
that
it
simply
wasn't
necessary
to
reach
them
because
there
was
evidence
of
activity
outside
of
the
period
of
duress.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
didn't
consider
that
actionable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
did
not
because
they
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
do
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
petitioner
filed
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
in
the
option.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
since
the
facts
here
are
obviously
subcritical,
i
would
like
to
briefly
consider
the
record
before
returning
to
the
legal
arguments
made
by
the
petitioner
and
raised
here.
i
should
note
that
we
take
a
radically
different
view
of
the
record
and
the
facts
here
than
does
the
petitioner.
indeed,
if
the
record
shows
the
facts
as
petitioner
feels
that
it
does,
i
think
the
government
wouldn't
be
here.
one
thing
upon
which
the
parties
do
agree
here,
however,
is
that
the
record
is
rather
confused
one.
we
agree
with
this
and
would
like
to
note
that
much
of
the
confusion
ever
resulted
from
a
number
in
inconsistencies
in
petitioner's
own
testimony.
indeed,
as
the
counsel
of
petitioner
noted
that
she
frankly
admitted
that
she
changed
her
story
at
one
point.
there
is
a
great
bit
of
confusion
about
dates
here.
the
petitioner
has
now
developed
what
appears
to
be
a
rather
plausible
handling
of
this
problem
of
dates
which
has
the
effect
of
telescoping
the
time
of
her
admitted
involvement
in
prostitution
insofar
as
it's
possible.
on
the
other
hand,
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
of
course
observed
the
witnesses
and
was
in
the
best
position
to
determine
their
credibility
found
the
facts
to
be
quite
different.
after
considering
the
testimony
and
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
and
all
the
surrounding
circumstances,
he
arrived
in
what
we
feel
to
be
a
most
plausible
and
probably
accurate
resolution
of
this
problem
of
confusion
particularly
as
to
dates
which
one
finds
in
the
record.
his
finding
that
petitioner's
engagement
in
prostitution
whatever
the
circumstances
of
its
commencement
continued
until
late
1958
and
not
1957
is
we
feel
amply
supported
in
the
record.
the
petitioner's
trip
in
knoxville
which
was
referred
to
previously
according
to
her
own
witness
mrs.
jackson
occurred
in
1958
and
not
1957.
the
petitioner's
husband
as
shown
by
the
record
in
the
kentucky
court
and
the
probative
custody
proceeding,
his
death
occurred
in
july
of
1958
or
1957.
the
petitioner
herself
stated
at
one
point
that
she
received
“gifts”
of
money
from
that
engaging
and
of
course
subsequent
to
learning
of
her
husband's
death
some
six
months
after
he
has
been
killed
and
at
an
apartment
by
the
way
that
she
moved
to
only
according
to
her
testimony
after
the
knoxville
trip.
other
testimony
we
feel
also
confirms
the
findings
as
to
dates
reached
by
the
special
inquiry
officer.
but
even
apart
from
his
findings,
once
here
in
fact
that
stands
out
clearly
from
the
record
is
that
petitioner
repeatedly
and
consistently
tied
the
determination
of
her
engagement
in
prostitution
to
her
meeting
this
mr.
anthony
emercon
whether
that
occurred
in
late
1958
or
as
early
as
late
1957.
in
the
circumstances
of
emercon
as
becoming
acquainted
with
petitioner,
confirmed
and
we
think
that
she
continued
to
engage
in
prostitution
at
least
at
the
very
least
until
meeting
him.
he
was
told
by
a
friend
who
said
that
he
had
relations
with
her
for
money
that
she
was
“in
the
business”.
now,
we
know
this
is
hearsay
and
so
did
everybody
below
but
hearsay
is
generally
admissible
in
administrative
proceedings
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
some
real
question
here
as
to
whether
it
might
not
have
been
admissible
judicially
under
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
but
anyhow,
he
went
to
her
apartment
for
the
purpose--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
probative
because
i
don't
think
people
generally
run
around
deporting
out
women
and
saying
things
like
this
about
them
if
there
isn't
some
substance.
emercon
went
to
her
apartment
as
the
record
shows
for
the
purpose
of
having
relations
with
her
although
he
states
that
he
could
not
go
through
with
it
but
left
$10.00
anyhow
or
probably
not
an
outstanding
alone
to
prove
that
she
was
then
engaging
to
prostitution.
this
evidence
we
feel
tends
to
strongly
corroborate
that
her
admitted
activity
continued
at
least
until
she
met
this
man.
at
the
earliest
under
any
view
of
the
record,
she
met
him
in
october
of
1957
at
least
six
months
after
the
time
that
she
herself
admits
that
the
prostitution
started.
the
inference
is
most
favorable
to
her
engaged
in
men
and
assuming
that
her
prostitution
started
in
april
and
not
february.
she
once
gave
an
affidavit
saying
that
it
started
in
february.
the
evidence
still
showed
an
engagement
of
prostitution
for
some
six
months
at
the
very
least.
only
two
months
of
which
are
accounted
for
by
the
alleged
arrest.
she
now
said
the
knoxville
trip
intervened
but
as
the
special
inquiry
also
found
it's
quite
likely
that
that
trip
did
not
occur
until
1958.
she
once
stated
that
she
spent
three
months
in
knoxville
but
under
a
present
view
of
what
happened,
she
could
have
been
there
no
longer
than
several
weeks.
she
started
working
for
the
vacuum
cleaner
salesman
in
april,
continued
for
two
months,
wanted
to
quit
but
continued
for
another
two
weeks
and
then
went
to
knoxville
to
get
away
returning
on
some
july
4.
parenthetically,
her
early
explanation
of
why
she
went
to
knoxville
that
mr.
wally
asked
her
to
go
there
to
practice
prostitution
and
that
she
was
evicted
from
her
apartment
because
another
girl
used
it
for
purposes
of
prostitution
it
seems
to
us
more
possible
just
as
it
seems
more
likely
that
the
knoxville
trip
did
not
occurred
in
198
and
that
she
had
engaged
in
prostitution
from
early
‘57
until
sometime
late
‘58.
in
any
event,
she
tied
the
end
of
her
prostitution
to
meeting
emercon
over
and
over
again
as
the
record
shows.
under
any
view
of
the
testimony,
this
could
not
have
occurred
until
late
1957
outside
of
the
period
of
the
alleged
duressthus
we
feel
the
government
showed
she
had
engaged
to
prostitution
even
apart
from
the
period
of
alleged
duressfor
substantial
period
of
time
in
1957.
in
addition,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
for
prostitution
in
early
1959,
no
charges
were
dropped
and
emercon
gave
a
statement
to
the
police
at
that
time
that
she
was
a
prostitute.
statement
which
she
says
was
untrue
and
was
given
to
help
her
retain
custody
of
her
daughter.
thus,
we
feel
the
evidence
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
emercon
said
it
was
not
true.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
gave
a
statement
admitting
that
she
was
engaging
in
prostitution
with
him
at
that
time
but
said
that
statement
was
untrue
because
there
was
something
about
protecting
her
daughter
because
the
police
were
going
to
take
it
that
he
didn't
give
any
statement
on
that.
that's
what
he
said.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
thus,
we
feel,
there's
at
least
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
her
engagement
continued
into
1959
even
in
that
so
far
in
two
months
that
she
admits.
now,
in
response
principally,
mr
chief
justice,
to
your
question,
her
duress
defense,
whatever
it's
merits
simply
doesn't
cover
the
ration
of
proven
engagement
in
prostitution
and
as
i
stated
contrary
to
her
session
the
factfinders
here
did
not
accepted
duress
offense
as
true.
rather
as
we
view
their
opinions
they
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
those
questions
or
to
decide
whether
her
story
should
be
believed
and
she
was
deportable
for
having
engaged
in
prostitution
outside
of
the
period.
now,
as
to
an
affirmative
defense
of
duress,
whoever
had
the
burden
of
proceeding
at
the
burden
on
proof
seems
to
ask
is
not
relevant
here
because
the
question
simply
never
arose.
even
assuming
that
the
government
had
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
once
the
defense
such
as
this
was
properly
raised,
that
burden
never
arose
here
because
her
evidence
that
she
produced
didn't
relate
wasn't
coextensive
with
the
period
of
her
engagement
in
prostitution
and
therefore,
the
prima
facie
case
which
deserve
as
it
made
out
was
not
refuted
and
they
did
not
need
to
rebut
that
evidence.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor
if
--
in
administrative
proceedings
and
litigation
generally,
defense
such
as
duress
is
generally
regarded
as
an
affirmative
defense
on
which
in
some
cases
the
person
asserting
the
defense
will
have
at
least
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
that's
generally
recognized
as
duress,
your
honor.
in
some
cases,
they'll
have
the
burden
of
--
ultimate
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue.
now,
here,
all
that
i'm
saying
is
this
question
is
--
simply
never
arose
here
because
even
though
she
did
produce
some
evidence
of
what
she
says
relates
to
duress,
the
government
did
not
need
to
attempt
to
rebut
that
evidence
if
it's
case
was
based
upon
--
could
be
based
upon
other
evidence
in
the
record,
evidence
apart
from
the
period
of
alleged
duress.
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
respect
to
the
factfinders'
view
of
her
story,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
have
they
found
it
necessary
to
pass
on
the
variety
of
the
story,
neither
the
special
inquiry
officer
nor
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
would
have
believed
them.
the
special
inquiry
officer
founded
a
hard
story
to
believe
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
stated
that
it
was
a
bizarre
story.
but
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
echoing
special
inquiry
officer
stated,
even
if
the
respondent's
story
is
to
be
believed,
even
it
be
considered
circumstances
under
which
she
entered
the
practice
prostitution
may
have
amounted
to
duress,
nevertheless
the
continuance
of
the
practice
until
at
least
1957,
late
1957
is
not
explained
cannot
be
dependent
on
the
ground
of
duress.
now,
just
several
words
about
the
adequacy
of
duress
defense
itself,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
rather
unusual
and
highly
attenuated
one.
it's
an
attempt
to
justify
on
the
grounds
principally
of
economic
duress
affirmative
misconduct.
now,
we
now
concede
that
in
some
limited
circumstances
there
maybe
an
adequate
defense
of
duress
under
such
condition.
the
courts
have
generally
carefully
scrutinized
such
alleged
duress
defense.
and
i
think
sociologist
would
probably
tell
us
that
most
prostitution
is
engaged
in
under
some
economic
duress.
now,
supposed
instead
of
deciding
to
engage
in
prostitution,
petitioner
decided
in
order
to
get
this
money
that
she
was
going
to
rob
a
bank
or
forge
a
check.
i
think
that
she
would
be
hard
pressed
to
maintain
that
the
circumstances
were
suppression
to
justify
her
activity
if
it
later
was
brought
a
proceeding
which
later
brought
against
deport.
falsely
analyzed
therefore
we've
been
able
to
hear
duress
defense
had
it
been
reached
and
if
you
reach
it
theoretically
it's
on
its
face
legally
inadequate
even
if
her
story
is
believed.
her
reliance
on
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
case
in
which
the
duress
defense
was
accepted
seems
to
us
wide
in
point.
that
case
was
a
rather
unusual
one.
the
girl
there
was
17
years
of
age,
she
was
held
in
custody
and
threatened
with
harm
that
she
didn't
brought
through
with
the
prostitution,
tried
to
escape
unsuccessfully
and
was
caught
continued
with
her
engagement
only
until
she
could
get
away
and
a
special
inquiry
officer
there
specifically
stated
that
he
found
her
story
completely
credible
and
believable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
what
the
story
is.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is.
there
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
long
subject
of
duress
in
something
other
than
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
analogizing
for
some
known
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
comes
pretty
close
to
that
but
that
has
to
be
based
of
course
on
credibility
of
her
story.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
think
--
i
think
i'd
say
essentially
though
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
state
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
words
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
have
meaning
more
intended
by
congress
to
have
meaning.
they
relate
to
quality
of
quantity
but
so
do
most
of
the
conventional
formulations
of
burden,
clear
and
convincing.
there
are
adjectives
that
attempt
to
describe
something
that's
very
difficult
to
describe.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
agree
generally.
it
seems
to
me
that
burden
on
the
service.
we
admit
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof
in
deportations
proceedings
and
in
view
this
statute
is
written
against
that
background
on
1952.
and
the
congress
used
these
words
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
to
tell
the
administrative
official
that
the
evidence
had
to
have
some
quality
to
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
it
relates
to
judiciary
review
as
has
been
argued,
it
seems
to
me
first
to
be
a
rather
strange
place
to
put
it
just
right
in
the
middle
of
a
long
statute
relating
to
proceedings
conducted
by
special
inquiry
officers.
second,
congress
apparently
didn't
feel
that
it
was
related
directed
towards
judiciary
review
because
in
1961
the
enacted
section
106
which
prescribes
a
standard
of
--
for
judiciary
review
in
courts
of
appeal.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
somewhat
superfluous
to
do
that
as
they
viewed
it
as
relating
only
to
judicial
review.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
there
have
been
a
few
isolated
cases
in
which
the
service
has
applied
a
higher
standard
than
preponderance
of
evidence
by
reasonable
substantial
probative
evidence.
the
cases
generally
involved
citizenship
clients
in
which
the
service
has
found
it
expedient
to
require
technically
as
to
a
claim
that
relates
to
an
event
long,
it
has
something
more
than
just
preponderance.
there
are
here
in
these
cases
that
are
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
within
the
attorney
general's
discretion
with
people
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
it
seems
to
me
the
problem
there
is
that
you're
talking
about
citizenship
matters
and
not
simply,
it
arises
in
a
deportation
proceedings
admittedly.
but
question
relates
to
citizenship
and
i
think
that
that's
been
the
impelling
back
which
led
them
to
require
a
higher
standard.
i
want
to
talk
for
a
couple
of
minutes
about
this
problem
of
burden
of
proof
and
degree
of
persuasion.
we
perceived
very
well
the
difference
and
the
distinction
between
the
location
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
one
or
the
other
person
who
whims
that
the
evidence
is
inactive
for
it
or
the
risk
of
non-persuasion
as
involved
and
the
degree
of
persuasion
or
conviction
which
a
factfinder
should
have
in
reaching
his
determinations
and
all
of
the
statutes
are
admittedly
not
explicit
on
this.
i
am
no
hesitancy
in
agreeing
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
deportation
cases
rest
upon
the
immigration
service.
and
it's
clear
to
me
that
section
242
has
prescribed
the
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence
standard
was
written
against
that
background.
the
congress
in
1952
made
specific
exceptions
by
placing
the
burden
of
proof
such
as
in
section
291
on
aliens
rather
than
on
the
government.
now,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me
that
specifically
place
it
on
someone
else
if
you're
not
assuming
that
it's
on
the
government
generally.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
fair
to
assume
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
burden
by
a
preponderance
of
the
quality
evidence
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
substantial
and
probative.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
talk
about
this
thing
that
the
trial
of
fact
has
to
be
convinced
that
it's
more
probably
true
than
not
in
this
case
the
petitioner
committed
acts
of
prostitution.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
caution
to
the
factfinder
that
the
evidence
has
to
be
of
a
certain
quality,
reasonable
substantial
and
probative.
so
i
think
this
court
in
rowoldt
and
gastelum
has
picked
this
language
up
not
only
language
of
judicial
review
but
used
it,
said
it
found
the
evidence
insignificantly
probative,
said
it
found
the
evidence
insubstantial.
it
seems
to
me
these
are
flexible
and
workable
terms
both
for
administrate
of
factfinding
and
for
judicial
review
and
there's
room
for
play
in
the
joints
and
hard
tuck
cases.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
where
do
i
get
it?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
and
leaves
on
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
true.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
and
we
have
these
three
conventional
formulations
that
we
talked
about,
i
think
it's
fair
for
the
board
to
assume
and
for
us
to
assume
the
congress
intended
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
the
congress
intended
that
that
was
a
standard
that
would
apply.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
someone
it
has
to
be
--
we
say
by
some
point
of
her
amount
it
seems
to
me
it's
fair
to
infer
that
congress
not
having
said
anything
about
it
intended
that
that
person
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place
denaturalization
proceedings
are
court
proceedings
and
this
court
exercising
its
supervisory
power
over
the
court
in
an
area
in
which
congress
cannot
specifically
acted
by
statute
prescribed
that
standard
because
of
the
considerations
involved.
that's
the
traditional
broad
standard
and
it
seems
to
us
to
make
immanently
good
sense
because
generally,
attempt
to
take
away
a
right
to
confer,
the
vested
rights
such
as
citizenship
by
naturalization
is
based
upon
broad
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
get
that
out
of
the
statute.
i
think
it's
a
fair
interest
that
that's
what
the
congress
intended.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
we
understand.
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
against
the
background
of
congressional
intent
and
enacting
in
1952
act
with
a
standard
for
the
following.
thank
you.
