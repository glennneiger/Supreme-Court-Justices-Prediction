justice

black
many
of
the
states
do
provide
these
safeguards.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
keep
a
record
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
does
new
york
go
in
amending
constitutional
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
writing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
an
open
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
right
of
review?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
why
do
you
have
the
burden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
they
reconcile
not
giving
a
counsel
have
civil
rights?
they
can
change
it
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
that
plus
the
reverse
on
that
up
that
those
hearings
that
i
was
then
thinking
about
some
of
the
other
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
they
go
from
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
left
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
left
on
the
juvenile
system
as
it
was
conceived
through
other
--
all
federal
constitutional
right
that
we
suggest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
they
do
that
differently
to
the
way
they
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
might
distinguish
between
them
just
like
in
the
federal
system,
years
ago
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
are
two
other
sections
in
the
arizona
code
as
there
are
in
several
other
states
neglect
and
dependency,
the
first
where
the
parent
is
found
to
be
in
fault
in
some
way
and
the
second
where
it
was
nobody's
fault.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course
that
question
is
not
presented
here
and
therefore
i
am
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
it
possible
for
you
to
judge
it,
how
is
it
possible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
the
question
that
the
man
is
entitled
to
a
public
trial.
how
is
it
possible
except
for
the
conception
to
draw
a
distinction
between
a
boy
that's
19
and
somebody
who's
23.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suggest
if
we
stick
to
the
word
of
the
constitution
and
forget
the
word
fundamental
fairness,
what
would
you
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
you
would
say
would
abide
to
the
judge
or
to
the
head
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
give,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
don't
have
it
here,
they
will
wait.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
not
been
held
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
following
the
ordinary
course
as
followed
by
the
juvenile
court
of
the
county
as
it
has
developed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
simply
following
the
procedure
as
it
has
developed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
on
second
thoughts
i
would
have
called
this
to
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
see
that
you
have
done
anything
extraordinarily
bad
that
you've
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you've
been
rather
following
the
court
as
it's
been
followed
in
the
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
that
questions
you
--
the
basis
here
whether
you're
--
that
that's
the
case,
they
set
you
in
a
situation
of
having
to
say,
does
it
not,
that
they're
not
entitled
to
legal
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
do
it
by
not
recognizing
some
federal
rights
that
this
fellow
will
have
except
that
he's
a
minor,
isn't
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
would
have
stay
in
prison
and
do
whatever
has
to
be
done.
it's
in
the
senate,
couldn't
do
a
tort.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
i
think
you're
sending
him
to
confinement.
whatever
you
call
the
place
of
confinement.
you're
the
one
who
will
have
that
separate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it's
not
confinement?
maybe
you
went
a
little
too
far.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you're
to
call
the
place
a
jail
instead
of
what
do
you
call
it
and
because
it's
not
a
jail,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
didn't
have
a
place
to
get
home.
he
had
no
parents,
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
about
the
concept
though
that
his
parents
are
not
given
the
child
a
home
or
that
does
not
extend
the
home
as
it
may
extend
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
you
were
trying
to
do.
did
you
send
the
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he's
denied
of
that
here,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
i
suppose
that
it
is
a
major
impact
for
both
of
the
judge
(inaudible).
