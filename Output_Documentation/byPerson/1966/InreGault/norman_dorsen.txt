before
proceeding
to
the
argument,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of

mr.
norman
dorsen
application
of
gault,
number
116.
this
case
raises
important
constitutional
questions
concerning
the
extent
which
requirements
of
procedural
fairness
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
applicable
to
juvenile
proceedings.
appellants,
the
parents
of
gerald
francis
gault
claim
in
particular
that
the
arizona
juvenile
code
on
its
face
and
is
applied
in
this
case
is
invalid
and
failing
to
provide
the
following
basic
protection.
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
the
right
to
adequate
notice
of
the
charges
of
delinquency
including
time
to
prepare,
the
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
complainant,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
the
right
to
a
transcript
and
meaningful
judicial
review.
these
issues
which
we
do
raise
and
pass
on
below
will
be
taken
up
severely
in
due
course.
in
this
case,
gerald
gault
at
age
15
was
committed
for
the
period
of
his
minority
that
is
for
up
to
six
years
to
the
state
industrial
school
in
arizona
after
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings
consisting
of
two
hearings
in
the
superior
court
of
gila
county,
arizona.
this
appeal
is
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
a
collateral
action.
that
court
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
maricopa
county
superior
court
which
after
a
hearing
dismissed
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
filed
on
gerald's
behalf
by
his
parents
paul
and
marjorie
gault.
gerald
is
still
in
confinement
and
has
been
for
two-and-one-half
years.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple
and
yet
it
is
not
possible
to
be
confident
about
exactly
what
happened
with
the
original
proceedings.
the
reasons
is
that
although
there
were
two
hearings
leading
to
the
determination
of
gerald's
delinquency
and
his
commitment,
a
transcript
was
not
made
at
either
one.
the
facts
accordingly
are
based
on
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
maricopa
county
superior
court.
at
that
hearing,
it
appeared
without
dispute
that
in
the
morning
of
june
8,
1964,
gerald
gault
and
a
friend
ronald
lewis
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
sheriff's
office
of
gila
county
as
the
result
of
the
complaint
by
one
mrs.
cook,
a
neighbor
of
the
boys
about
an
allegedly
lewd
telephone
call.
gerald
at
this
time
was
on
six
months
probation
following
an
incident
in
february
1964.
at
that
time
he
was
with
another
boy
who
has
alleged
to
have
taken
the
wallet.
the
other
boy
was
confined
and
gerald
was
put
on
probation.
after
mrs.
cook's
complaint,
the
boys
were
taken
to
the
local
probation
office
pursuant
to
the
arizona
code.
the
probation
officers
flagg
and
henderson
who
have
the
authority
of
peace
officers
in
arizona
decided
to
detain
the
boys
for
delinquency
hearing.
and
flagg
interrogated
gerald
at
some
length
during
the
evening
of
june
8
and
the
morning
of
june
9.
no
notice
of
the
detention
or
charges
was
left
at
the
gault
home.
mrs.
gault
who
returned
form
work
at
6
pm
on
that
day,
june
8
was
informed
by
her
older
son,
through
neighbors,
that
gerald
was
detained.
and
she
then
went
to
the
detention
home.
there
she
was
told
by
probation
officer
flagg,
“of
the
general
nature
of
the
charges,”
and
that
a
hearing
would
be
held
the
following
day,
june
9.
no
written
notice
of
this
hearing
or
the
charges
was
given
to
mrs.
gault
at
any
time.
on
june
9,
a
petition
charging
gerald
with
being
a
delinquent
minor
was
filed
by
probation
officer
flagg
with
the
juvenile
court.
this
is
on
page
80
of
the
record
of
the
petition.
this
petition
was
filed
pursuing
to
the
arizona
juvenile
code.
in
the
arizona
juvenile
code,
a
delinquent
child
is
defined
in
section
8-2016
in
the
appellant's
brief
on
page
3a.
mrs.
gault
did
not
receive
notice
of
the
petition
and
did
not
see
it
until
august
17
when
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
was
held
in
maricopa
county.
a
juvenile
referral
report
an
internal
juvenile
court
document
prepared
by
the
probation
office
for
the
court
charged
gerald
with
making
lewd
phone
calls.
this
was
prepared
when
gerald
was
taken
into
custody
on
june
8,
was
completed
after
the
hearings
and
filed
with
the
juvenile
court
on
june
15.
it
too
was
not
brought
to
appellant's
notice
until
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
august
17.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
suggestion
has
been
made
mr.
justice
stewart
that
notice
was
given
to
mrs.
gault.
it
is
plain
from
the
record
that
no
notice
of
any
time
was
given
to
anyone
else
in
the
family
of
gault.
and
therefore
i
want
to
emphasize
the
extents
on
which
the
fact
showed
any
notice
of
any
kind
to
any
member
of
the
family.
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
juvenile
received
no
notice
whatsoever
as
far
as
the
record
shows.
there
was
discussion
with
the
juvenile
orally
and
he
may
have
known
the
general
tenor
of
the
charges
but
the
only
notice
that
was
given
that
was
discussed
in
the
record
and
discussed
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
with
the
oral
notice
given
to
mrs.
gault
on
the
evening
of
june
8.
on
june
9th,
the
initial
hearing
took
place
in
judge
mcghee's
chambers.
he
was
the
juvenile
judge.
present
with
gerald,
his
mother,
his
older
brother
lewis
and
mr.
flagg
and
mr.
henderson,
the
probation
officers.
no
one
was
sworn,
no
transcript
was
made,
and
neither
gerald
nor
mrs.
gault
was
represented
by
a
counsel
or
advised
of
any
right
to
counsel.
with
respect
to
gerald's
conduct
that
led
to
a
finding
of
juvenile
delinquency,
there
was
conflict
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
as
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
at
page
84
of
your
record,
“there
was
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
concerning
what
transpired
at
the
juvenile
hearing.
mrs.
gault
testified
in
response
to
the
judge's
questions
of
the
juvenile
hearing.
gerald
said
he
dialed
mrs.
c's
number,
asked
her
if
it
was
such
and
such
a
number
said,
there
was
a
friend
of
his
who
wanted
to
talk
to
her
then
handed
the
phone
to
ronald
who
made
lewd
remarks
--”
mr.
norman
dorsen
they're
on
page
79,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
referral
report.
officer
flagg
testified
that
at
the
juvenile
hearing
gerald
admitted
making
the
phone
call
and
using
some
of
the
obscene
language.
judge
mcghee
testified
that
gerald
admitted
using
some
lewd
words.
following
the
hearing
on
june
9th
judge
mcghee
continued
the
case
until
june
15
because
in
his
words,
“i
didn't
know
myself
what
i
was
going
to
do
because
i
was
not
satisfied
from
the
testimony
there
at
that
time.”
accordingly,
officer
flagg
did
some
more
investigating
until
the
11th,
he
testified,
“i
talked
to
jerry
more
to
see
if
he
would
tell
me
any
more.
i
talked
to
ronnie
lewis
some
more
looking
for
a
change
of
stories
perhaps.”
gerald
was
returned
home
on
june
11th
or
12th.
on
that
day
mrs.
gault
received
the
note
on
plain
white
pages
from
officer
flagg
which
said,
“mrs.
gault,
judge
mcghee
has
set
monday
june
15th
1964
at
11
am
as
the
day
and
time
for
further
hearings
on
gerald's
delinquency.”
signed,
flagg.
this
was
the
only
written
notice
of
any
kind
that
any
member
of
the
gault
family
received
concerning
this
matter
prior
to
the
determination
of
delinquency
and
a
commitment
of
gerald
to
the
industrial
school.
on
june
15th
the
second
hearing
was
held.
it
was
held
in
the
presence
of
gerald
and
both
of
his
parents,
officer
flagg
and
ronald
lewis,
the
other
boy
involved
in
the
incident
and
ronald's
father.
again,
neither
gerald
nor
his
parents
was
represented
by
a
counsel.
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
august
17
there
also
was
conflict
about
what
happened
at
the
juvenile
court
hearing
of
june
15,
again,
the
words
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
“it
was
a
further
conflict
in
the
evidence
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
concerning
the
testimony
at
the
second
juvenile
hearing.”
both
mr.
and
mrs.
gault
testified
that
no
one
accused
gerald
of
making
a
lewd
telephone
call,
and
also
said
that
gerald
admitted
nothing.
but
judge
mcghee
said
gerald
admitted
making
some
of
the
lewd
remarks
although
not
the
more
serious
ones.
at
this
hearing
flagg
supported
the
gault's
version
stating
that
neither
boy
admitted
making
the
actual
remark.
it
should
be
noted
that
mrs.
cook,
the
woman
who
had
complained
about
the
phone
call
was
not
present
or
called
as
a
witness
at
either
hearing.
officer
flagg
had
talked
to
her
over
the
telephone
on
june
9th
and
judge
mcghee
had
not
spoken
to
her
at
all
when
mrs.
gault
passed
the
judge
during
the
hearing
of
june
15
while
mrs.
cook
was
not
present
saying
that,
“she
wanted
mrs.
cook
present
so
she
could
see
which
boy
had
done
the
talking,
the
dirty
talking
over
the
phone.”
judge
mcghee
answered,
“she
didn't
have
to
be
present.”
on
june
15th,
judge
mcghee
handed
down
an
order
containing
no
findings
or
facts.
the
order
simply
states
that
after
a
full
hearing
and
due
deliberation
the
court
finds
that
the
said
minor
is
a
delinquent
child.
he
ordered
and
says
that
the
child's
own
good
and
the
best
interest
of
the
state
require
that
he
be
committed
to
the
state
industrial
school
for
the
period
of
his
minority
unless
sooner
discharged
by
due
process
of
law.
mr.
norman
dorsen
15
years
old.
in
his
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
the
judge,
judge
mcghee
indicated
that
there
were
several
bases
for
his
decision.
one
was
the
violation
of
section
13-37
of
the
arizona
criminal
code
which
is
contained
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
first
page.
this
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
use,
“vulgar,
abusive
or
obscene
language
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
or
child.”
a
delinquent
child
is
defined
by
the
juvenile
code
reproduced
to
page
3a
of
appellant's
brief
as
including
the
child
who
has
violated
the
law
of
the
state
such
as
the
section
i
have
just
quoted.
mr.
norman
dorsen
two
months
is
the
maximum
penalty
plus
a
fine.
mr.
norman
dorsen
up
to
six
years
mr.
justice
fortas.
judge
mcghee
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
personally
have
not
been
there
but
i
can
say
it's
a
school
where
delinquent
children
are
sent.
the
school
was
kept
under
the
control
of
a
board
of
supervisors.
the
boys
were
sent
up
there
and
sent
up
there
for
various
offenses
ranging
from
theft
to
a
lewd
telephone
call.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
just
delinquent
children.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
believe
it
is.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
they
can't
go
home,
that's
pretty
clear.
they
can't
go
home
until
there's
minority,
unless
the
board
of
governors
of
the
state
industrial
school
will
let
them
go
home.
the
boy
is
in
exclusive
control
over
this
board.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
absolutely
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
had
no
record
of
any
kind
except
for
the
first
allegation
that
i've
mentioned
except
for
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
judge
didn't
mentioned
at
the
time
that
he
reached
the
decision
as
i
was
just
about
to
mention
that
there
was
an
earlier
incident
in
1962
having
to
do
with
a
baseball
glove
that
someone
had
suggested
that
gerald
had
stolen
but
there
was
no
hearing
on
this
and
the
case
was
dropped
because
there
was
no
material
foundation
for
the
claim.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
there
was
nothing
else
beside
the
judge's
statements.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record.
judge
mcghee
testified
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
no
time
did
he
ever
advised
gerald's
parents
that
he
was
charged
with
violating
the
statute.
another
ground,
the
second
ground
on
which
the
judge
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
was
charged
with
being
a
delinquent
because
he
violated
that
statute.
that
was
the
first
ground
that
the
judge
stated.
the
second
ground
in
which
the
judge
considered
the
boy
delinquent
was
that
he
was
“habitually
involved
in
immoral
manners.”
and
in
this
he
was
referring
to
subsection
d
of
section
2016
of
the
juvenile
code.
the
exact
language
of
subsection
d
which
is
on
page
3
of
the
appendix
is
“a
child
who
habitually
so
deports
himself
as
to
injure
or
endanger
the
morals
or
health
of
himself
or
others.”
judge
mcghee
also
testified
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
there
was
“probably
another
ground
too.”
in
connection
with
the
ground
of
habitually
involved
in
immoral
manners
at
first
mentioned
of
which
was
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
the
judge
said
that
he
took
account
of
an
earlier
allegation
that
gerald
had
stolen
the
baseball
glove
from
another
boy
and
lied
about
it
to
the
police.this
allegation
was
contained
in
that
probation
office
referral
report
but
the
incident
was
never
made
the
subject
of
charges
in
juvenile
court
and
no
hearing
was
held
according
to
judge
mcghee
because
of
lack
of
material
foundation
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
is
not
in
this
record.
judge
mcghee
testified
to
this
but
it's
not
in
this
record
mr.
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
mentioned
this
fact
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
questioning
and
answers
of
gerald
by
the
court
at
the
two
hearings
led
to
his
adjudication
as
a
delinquent
and
his
commitment.
judge
mcghee
testified
as
follows
at
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
question:
“were
any
adult
witnesses
sworn
and/or
heard
against
the
boy
gerald
gault?”
answer:
“no,
it
was
all
in
my
mind,
done
upon
the
admissions
of
gerald
gault
and
at
no
point
was
gerald
informed
of
a
right
to
remain
silent.”
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
the
judge's
testimony,
judge
mcghee.
after
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
the
maricopa
county
superior
court
dismissed
the
petition,
discharged
the
writ
and
remanded
gerald
to
the
state
industrial
school.
the
superior
court
did
not
write
an
opinion.
an
appeal
from
this
decision,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
affirmed.
in
an
extensive
opinion
starting
at
page
83
of
the
record
it
dealt
with
each
of
the
constitutional
claims
there
are
the
subjects
of
this
appeal.
the
court
held
as
follows:
first,
regarding
notice
of
charges,
the
court
ruled
that
young
gault
received
adequate
notice
because
“mrs.
gault
in
the
exact
nature
of
the
charge
against
gerald
gault
from
the
day
he
was
taken
to
the
detention
home.”
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
believe
so.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
our
petition
is
that
there
was
no
adequate
notice
at
all
because
there
was
no
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
whether
it's
the
constitutional
part
and
the
adequacy,
it
seemed
to
me.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
that's
right
and
i
think
that's
true.
the
court
also
claimed
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
exact
language
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
94
of
the
record
and
the
top
of
page
95.
we
find
the
petitioners
were
not
denied
due
process
of
law
and
the
court
goes
on
to
say
mrs.
gault
knew
the
exact
nature
of
the
charge
against
gerald
from
the
day
he
was
taken
to
the
detention
home.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
court
also
stated
with
respect
to
notice
the
following
rule
that
would
govern
in
the
future
that
the
infant
and
his
parents
or
guardian
will
receive
a
petition
only
reciting
a
conclusion
of
delinquency.
but
no
later
than
the
initial
hearing
by
the
judge
they
must
be
advised
with
the
fact
involved
in
the
case.
if
the
charges
are
denied
it
must
be
given
a
reasonable
period
of
time
to
prepare,
that's
at
92
in
the
record.
second,
with
respect
to
the
right
of
counsel,
the
court
below
held
although
parents
cannot
be
denied
representation
by
retained
counsel
due
process
does
not
require
that
an
infant
have
the
right
to
counsel.
the
court
held
further
that
gerald
was
not
denied
due
process
because
his
parents
“knew”
they
could
have
retained
counsel.
the
court
also
said
that
the
parents
and
the
probation
officer
may
be
relied
upon
to
protect
the
infant's
interest.
third,
with
respect
to
confrontation
and
cross-examination,
the
court
below
held
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
because
the
relevancy
of
confrontation
only
arises
with
the
charges
of
denial.
the
court
stated
that
the
parents
knew
they
could
have
called
witnesses
and
cross-examined
probation
officer
flagg.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
he
was.
as
far
as
i
know
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
record
showed
he
was
a
regular
member
of
the
superior
court
of
arizona.
mr.
norman
dorsen
sitting
in
his
juvenile
capacity
pursuant
to
the
juvenile
code.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
there
is
not.
it's
a
section
of
the
superior
court
and
sometimes
the
case
is
just
sent
to
referees.
mr.
norman
dorsen
with
respect
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
court
below
noted
the
division
of
authority
in
state
courts
of
whether
an
infant
had
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
a
right
to
be
advised
with
the
privilege.
the
court
then
held
that
the
necessary
flexibility
for
individualized
treatment
will
be
enhanced
by
a
rule
which
does
not
require
the
judge
to
advise
the
infant
of
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
fifth
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
right
of
transcript
and
appellate
review,
the
court
held
that
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
from
a
juvenile
court
order
and
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
transcript.
the
court
said
that
the
juvenile
court
has
discretion
to
order
or
deny
the
taking
of
the
transcript.
it
is
the
position
of
appellants
that
gerald
gault
was
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
in
the
juvenile
court
of
gila
county
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
before
proceeding
to
these
constitutional
questions
severely
it
maybe
helpful
if
i
very
briefly
outline
some
of
the
background
of
the
juvenile
court
problem.
prior
to
the
juvenile
court
movement
which
started
in
illinois
in
1899,
juveniles
were
treated
like
all
other
criminals.
at
least
all
other
criminal
defendants
except
for
capacity
problems
of
mens
rea
it
was
subject
to
the
criminal
law
and
they
received
the
existing
safeguards.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
know.
i
believe
it
was
a
common
law
rule
of
seven
but
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
is
that
correct
mr.
parks?
the
juvenile
court
movement
was
a
response
to
findings
of
social
science,
psychology,
social
welfare
and
to
new
theories
of
rehabilitation
that
flourished
to
the
turn
of
the
century.
accordingly,
juvenile
courts
were
established
beginning
in
1899
and
now
we
find
them
in
every
state
of
the
union.
the
proceedings
in
this
juvenile
courts
are
civil
not
criminal.
the
court
is
theoretically
engaged
in
determining
the
needs
of
the
child
and
of
society
rather
than
adjudicating
guilt
and
meeting
out
punishment.
the
courts
in
the
state
are
acting
as
parens
patriae
rather
than
prosecutors
or
judge,
treating
the
child
as
with
a
firm
but
benevolent
parents.
but
parens
patriae
and
individualized
justice
led
to
proceedings
in
juvenile
court
had
spent
with
certain
traditional
rights.
in
some
states,
court
have
ruled
that
juveniles
are
not
entitled
to
bail,
to
indictment,
to
speedy
in
public
trial,
to
confrontation
of
accuses,
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
the
right
to
counsel.
but
up
late
there
has
been
increasing
criticism
by
scholars
and
reexamination
by
courts.
questions
have
arisen
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
original
goals
of
juvenile
court
movements
and
especially
about
the
barter
of
alleged
special
treatment
for
constitutional
protection.
the
climax
came
last
year
in
kent
v.
united
states,
summing
up
the
present
situation,
the
court
said
as
follows,
“while
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
original
laudable
purpose
of
juvenile
courts,
studies
and
critiques
in
recent
years
raised
serious
questions
as
to
where
actual
performance
measures
well
enough
against
theoretical
purpose
to
make
power
to
the
immunity
of
the
process
from
the
reach
of
constitutional
guarantees
applicable
to
adults.
there
was
evidence
in
fact
that
there
may
be
grounds
for
concern
that
the
child
receives
the
worse
of
both
worlds.
that
he
gets
neither
the
protections
accorded
to
adults
nor
the
solicitous
care
and
regenerative
treatment
postulated
for
children.”
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
douglas.
and
i
would
--
in
the
intent
the
court
did
not
decide
these
questions
but
they
were
specifically
--
the
court
specifically
reserved
and
specifically
reserved
the
question
where
the
constitutional
guarantees
which
would
be
applicable
to
adults
must
be
applied
in
juvenile
court
proceedings.
this
case
presents
that
issue
in
the
five
specific
respects
i've
outlined
above.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
certain.
i
think
it
was
amended
1962
but
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
date
of
enactment,
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
many
of
them
do,
many
of
them
do
and
in
safeguards
specifically
some
of
them
are
provided
by
the
statute
and
some
are
provided
by
court
rule.
for
example,
i
was
about
to
turn
to
the
question
of
right
to
counsel
and
according
to
the
legal
aid,
the
national
legal
aid
and
advisers
brief,
78%
of
the
jurisdictions
in
which
legal
aid
operate
provide
a
right
to
counsel.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct,
under
the
recent
family
court
act,
new
york
has
provided
for
the
point
of
law
guardians
and
they
are
specifically
enjoined
with
responsibility
of
representing
children's
interest.
mr.
norman
dorsen
record
is
kept.
the
standards
of
the
--
that
have
been
promulgated
jointly
by
the
national
council
on
crime
and
delinquency
by
the
national
council
of
juvenile
court
judges
and
by
the
children's
bureau
of
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
also
provide
for
these
safeguards.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
have
seen
some
mr.
justice
fortas
and
we
submit
that
these
are
insufficient.
the
justifications
are
several.
one
is
the
justification
of
the
therapeutic
aid
or
the
individualized
justice
that
is
to
be
accorded
juveniles
but
of
course
in
this
case,
we
are
not
saying
anything
about
what
treatment
juveniles
should
receive
once
they
are
determined
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
page
18.
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
are
statutes.
california
for
example
goes
up
to
18
to
21.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
have
seen
no
satisfactory
explanation.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
we
reject
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
--
i
think
it
may
if
i
understood
exactly
what
it
meant
i
could
be
sure,
well
it's
obviously
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
that
argument
might
well
be,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
must
confess
that
it
may
well
be.
i
do
not
understand
it
because
i
--
no
matter
how
many
times
one
says
parens
patriae
i
think
there
is
a
small
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
but
that
may
well
be
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
the
argument
that
the
ohio
juvenile
court
judges
made
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
guess
that
is
it.
it's
of
course
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
mr.
chief
justice,
in
connection
with
the
question
of
justification
for
the
procedures
in
this
case
whether
considered
from
the
point
of
view
of
custody,
treatment,
therapeutic
gain.
appellants
would
like
to
stress
to
the
court
the
very
important
and
in
our
view
a
very
sharp
distinction
between
the
determination
of
delinquency
and
any
custodial
obligation
that
the
state
may
take
after
the
child
has
been
determined
to
be
delinquent.
there's
no
inconsistencies
in
our
view
between
having
the
kind
of
protections
that
we
are
suggesting
are
required
by
due
process
and
the
finest
custodial
and
treatment
processes
in
the
country.
just
two
weeks
ago
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
unanimously
reversed
a
juvenile's
case
in
determination
of
delinquency
and
judge
proctor
in
a
very
careful
opinion
said
assuming
a
juvenile
is
not
entitled
to
all
the
constitutional
requirements
of
the
criminal
trial,
we
firmly
believe
he
is
at
least
entitled
to
a
fact-finding
process
which
measures
up
to
the
essentials
of
due
process
and
a
fair
hearing.
and
in
this
connection
it
might
be
worth
knowing
that
new
york
and
its
recent
statute
has
specifically
provided
for
two
distinct
hearings
a
determination
of
delinquency
hearing
and
a
disposition
hearing
and
similar
standards
are
suggested
by
the
children's
bureau
of
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare,
the
juvenile
court
judges
and
the
national
council
for
crime
and
delinquency.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
new
york
provides
with
an
appointive
right
to
counsel
and
provide
for
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
provide
the
facts
upon
which
the
delinquency
is
alleged
to
have
occurred
or
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
child
and
they
provide
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
writing,
in
writing.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
not
an
open
hearing,
closed
hearing.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
jury
trial
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
norman
dorsen
a
right
of
review.
mr.
norman
dorsen
bergen,
new
york
is
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
arizona
it's
by
clearing
convincing
evidence.
confrontation
is
permitted
and
required
in
new
york.
in
fact,
they
go
so
far
as
to
say
specifically
in
the
statute
that
a
confession
made
out
of
the
court
is
not
admissible
as
the
soul
basis
for
finding
delinquency.
mr.
norman
dorsen
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
in
fact
there
was
an
earlier
case
in
1972,
the
lewis
case
which
was
in
the
sense
overruled
by
the
recent
changes
in
new
york
law.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
of
course
there
is
a
question
about
that
and
for
example
to
take
the
--
example,
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
there
are
certain
problems
of
confidentiality
that
would
seemed
to
be
applicable
in
the
case
of
the
child.
so
there
might
be
a
justification
for
keeping
such
a
proceeding.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
of
course,
those
haven't
been
tested
yet.
mr.
norman
dorsen
they
go
to
an
appellate
court
through
the
new
york
court
system.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
trial
de
novo
although
some
states
have
provided
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
norman
dorsen
not
in
new
york.
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
is
a
transcript.
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
we
would
suggest
that
the
best
part
namely
the
opportunity
for
the
state
in
the
case
where
a
child
has
been
properly
determined
to
be
a
juvenile
to
do
what
it
can,
to
treat
him,
to
take
care
of
him,
to
rehabilitate
him.
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
procedures
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
--
i
think
that
only
in
the
sense
that
children
are
in
a
more
formative
stage
and
that
the
theory
of
a
childcare
has
been
that
a
child
can
be
brought
along
in
a
different
way
than
adults
can
be.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
true.
unfortunately
the
system
has
developed
in
many
states
up
to
three
quarters
of
the
states,
it's
still
possible
for
juveniles
to
be
referred
to
regular
prisons
in
the
company
of
adult
criminals
and
this
is
pointed
out
in
the
health,
education
and
welfare
study
on
page
71.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
am
not
urging
that
position
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
would
distinguish
it
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
record
doesn't
present
the
question
from
the
point
of
view
that
the
child's
special
sensitivities
to
publicity,
special
stigma
that
might
attach
to
a
child,
the
child's
disorientation
before
a
the
public.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
sure
how
i
would
decide
that
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
have
thought
about
it
and
i
would
now
urge
the
court
to
take
the
position
that
a
public
trial
is
required.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
recent
harvard
study
cited
to
the
fact
that
the
fbi
is
given
all
reports
of
delinquency
or
at
least
a
large
number
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
as
far
as
i
know
they
do
even
though
the
arizona
code
purports
to
protect
the
juvenile
by
providing
for
destruction
of
all
records
within
two
--
or
after
two
years
following
his
release
from
confinement.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
include
the
hearing
on
disposition.
this
case
of
course
does
not
present
that
question.
it
would
depend
upon
which
aspect
of
the
hearing
on
disposition
are
you
referring.
for
example,
i
should
think
that
there
will
be
certain
types
of
evidence,
social
studies
of
the
child's
family
that
would
be
relevant
in
the
dispositional
hearing
that
wouldn't
be
relevant
with
the
determination
of
delinquency.
and
i
would
permit
that
evidence
to
be
introduced.
mr.
norman
dorsen
absolutely.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
the
way
i
would
put
it
myself
would
be
that
no
fact
that
the
judge
is
taking
account
of
in
determining
whether
to
dispose
the
child
one
way
or
another
should
be
left
undisclosed
to
the
child
in
his
counsel.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
think
i
would
go
that
far.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
don't
think
i
would
although
there
are
problems
about
that
because
of
the
right
to
counsel
problem.
for
example
in
this
case
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
i
think
you
do
because
i
think
that
in
this
case
for
example
even
before
the
hearing
there
was
a
question
of
when
the
child
was
going
to
admit
or
deny
the
charges
and
in
particular
with
respect
to
his
right
of
counsel
as
the
record
here.
i
think
very
dramatically
demonstrates,
when
this
child
did
not
deny
the
charges
against
him
at
the
first
opportunity
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
he
lost
the
right
at
that
point
to
an
adjudicative
hearing.
and
naturally
we
would
say
that
this
was
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
and
he
would
be
entitled
to
counsel.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
i
wouldn't
say
that.
but
i
do
recognize
mr.
justice
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
should
say
he
should
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
that's
right
although
i'm
not
taking
that
position
in
this
case.
i'm
taking
the
position
in
this
case
that
at
the
core
of
the
hearing
process
which
this
case
demonstrates,
the
counsel
is
certainly
necessary
and
the
amount
of
prejudice
that
this
record
seems
to
me
to
show
regarding
the
rights
of
this
boy
seems
to
me
to
be
conclusive
on
that
point.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
so
sure,
i
could
suggest
the
distinction
although
it
is
clear
not
only
because
the
question
wasn't
raised
but
because
the
question
in
this
case
could
not
have
been
raised.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
i've
answer
the
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
tried
to
answer
you
by
saying
that
i
can
think
of
no
distinction
if
there
is
a
delinquency
procedure
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
i
tried
to
show
a
possible
distinction.
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out
that
there
may
be
problems
in
the
formulation
i
made.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
it
is
and
similarly
in
connection
with
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
would
not
draw
that
distinction
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
--
i
would
like
to
comment
if
i
may
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
proj
--
i
would
say
that
i
might
draw
though
of
a
child
--
between
a
child
of
eight
and
a
man
of
21.
i
might
think
of
a
way
in
which
that
the
proceeding
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
that
would
present
a
hard
question.
i
would
like
to
comment
though
on
a
question
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
raised
because
i
can
think
of
a
possible
ability
in
terms
of
having
welfare
workers
or
probation
officers
who
are
insulated
from
the
delinquency
hearing
who
are
insulated
from
the
adversary
system
dealing
with
the
boy
in
a
preliminary
stage
without
his
lawyer.
and
we
have
to
see
that
system
but
it
is
possible
for
me
to
conceive
of
the
system
without
welfare
worker
especially
if
the
boy
is
not
with
his
parents
dealing
with
him
on
a
confidential
and
private
basis.
but
that
would
be
a
very
specially
constructed
system
and
i
would
have
to
see
it
before
i
want
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
that
is
the
hard
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
black
have
expressed
the
opinion
and
i
could
see
a
distinction
being
made
between
an
8-year-old
boy
and
a
17-year-old
boy.
that
is
as
far
as
i
can
go
at
this
time
because
i'm
just
not
sure
if
i
would
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
well,
(inaudible)
case
disposed
of
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
certainly
would
say
it
would.
well
they'd
be
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
is
not
held
and
this
case
doesn't
present
it.
there
was
no
request
for
it.
the
facts
of
this
case
though
--
well,
i
would
like
now
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
me
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
because
this
record
as
i
tried
to
state
it
as
well
as
i
can
does
show
that
this
boy
was
prejudiced
in
countless
ways
not
only
because
of
the
absence
of
the
counsel
but
because
at
no
time
was
either
he
or
his
parents
informed
that
the
specific
charge
upon
which
the
judge
ultimately
made
a
decision.
if
a
lawyer
were
present
for
example,
the
lawyer
would
have
tried
to
establish
exactly
what
the
charge
was.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
a
judge
--
i
don't
think
it
was
entirely
clear,
because
he
said
at
one
point
that
on
page
61
of
the
record
that
there
was
probably
some
other
ground
for
the
decision.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
also
think
it's
important
to
stress
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
think
so
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
it
makes
it
different
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
it
substantially
different
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
is
that
if
certain
facts
which
are
alleged
to
be
true
by
the
state
are
going
to
be
taken
account
in
determining
whether
a
boy
is
going
to
be
judged
as
a
delinquent
and
his
freedom
taken
away,
those
facts
should
be
stated
in
advanced
specifically
and
a
few
times
where
a
preparation
for
the
case
can
be
made.
in
this
case,
the
notice
was
given
at
7:30
or
8
o'clock
in
the
evening
of
june
8
and
the
hearing
was
the
next
day.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct,
that
leads
in
their
brief
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
we
--
in
our
brief,
we'll
rest
in
our
brief
and
this
privilege
against
self-incrimination
point
and
the
point
related
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
the
brief
of
the
national
legal
aid
has
its
good
compilation
i
believe
it
has
been
made
in
this
field.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
it
does.
the
--
the
legal
aid
brief
points
out
with
respect
to
some
of
the
items
that
have
been
raised
this
morning
that
78%
of
the
jurisdictions
give
a
right
to
counsel,
89%
provide
confrontation
of
witnesses
and
70%
of
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
and
almost
90%,
i
believe,
a
right
to
an
appeal
and
comparably
5%
which
is
in
other
words,
this
is
a
--
it
has
come
to
be
recognized
over
the
past
few
years
and
if
you
discover
the
criticism
and
the
work
of
the
courts
that
these
rights
are
essential
there
are
no
way
you
can
be
consistent
with
the
therapeutic
and
dispositional
aspects
of
the
juvenile
proceeding
that
the
specific
facts
as
mr.
justice
fortas
stated
are
those
that
have
to
be
rebutted.
there
are
lawyers
as
essential
or
more
essential
in
juvenile
cases
than
it
is
with
adults.
even
under
the
rule
of
betts
v.
brady
under
the
fundamental
fairness
betts
v.
brady,
it
was
well
established
by
this
court
in
the
merely
and
other
cases
that
the
age
of
the
defendant
was
a
pertinent
fact
that
you
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
it
was
fundamentally
unfair
not
to
provide
him
with
a
lawyer.
our
position
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
isn't
--
it
is
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
like
to
answer
if
i
can.
74%
according
to
the
legal
aid
in
appendix
page
10a
of
the
legal
aid
brief,
74%
provided
it,
if
the
child
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
of
this
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
and
of
course
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
it's
very
plain
that
even
though
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
said
that
mrs.
gault
knew
of
her
right
to
retain
counsel,
that
is
far
from
providing
the
right
to
counsel
that
we
believe
the
constitution
requires.
first
of
all,
it's
gerald
gault's
right
--
we're
trying
to
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart
alluded
to
this
morning.
secondly,
the
right
we
believe
is
required
by
the
constitution
is
the
right
to
assign
counsel
if
the
boy
can't
afford
it.
instead,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
said
that
the
parents
or
the
probation
officer
can
be
--
can
act
as
a
counsel.
now,
of
course
if
the
parent
himself
were
before
the
court
is
a
defendant,
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
lawyer
because
on
the
theory
that
he
couldn't
defend
his
own
case
but
when
the
child
is
in
the
position
as
the
defendant,
when
the
child
is
before
the
court
with
up
to
six
years
of
his
freedom
to
be
lost,
somehow
the
arizona
supreme
court
finds
that
the
parent
can
satisfactory
act
on
behalf
of
the
child
as
the
lawyer
would
and
as
far
as
the
suggestion
that
officer
flagg
act
as
the
lawyer,
the
probation
officer
in
this
case
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
even
less
realistic
and
less
fair,
there's
a
flat
conflict
of
interest.
flagg
is
the
person
who
signed
the
petition.
he
signed
the
petition
on
behalf
of
the
state
in
which
he
said
that
he
is
informed
and
believes
and
therefore
alleges
that
gerald
gault
is
a
delinquent.
that's
on
page
80
of
the
record.
flagg
did
not
do
a
thing
for
gerald
gault.
it's
well
established
they
didn't
informed
gerald
gault
of
any
of
his
rights,
any
of
his
rights
throughout
the
proceeding.
instead,
what
he
did
try
to
do
was
to
get
a
change
of
story
as
the
record
points
out
on
page
49.
he
was
certainly
acting
as
an
adversary.
in
short,
our
position
is
with
respect
to
the
lawyer
--
with
respect
to
the
various
other
constitutional
protections
that
we
believe
to
be
fundamental
that
the
absence
of
a
lawyer
does
not
mean
that
we'll
have
a
harmonious
informal,
non-adversary
proceeding.
instead
it
means
that
we'll
have
a
one
sided
adversary
proceeding,
a
one-sided
adversary
proceeding
in
which
the
cards
are
stocked
against
the
child
from
beginning
to
end.
and
we
suggest
that
this
court
at
this
time
recognize
for
example
on
the
case
where
a
father
and
his
son
are
alleged
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
did
not
mean
and
i'd
like
to
answer
that
very
specifically
mr.
justice
i'm
not
suggesting
and
i
hope
my
words
are
not
taken
to
suggest
that
there's
any
intention
to
do
the
child
in.
we
--
i
said
at
the
beginning
and
i
would
like
to
reaffirm
that
the
purposes
of
these
acts
was
the
highest.
the
purposes
were
the
help
of
the
child.
the
problem
is
that
the
way
their
system
is
developed
as
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
said
just
the
other
day
that
fundamental
protections
are
essential.
i
think
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
--
i
should
believe
it
would
be
but
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
you
mean
looking
at
the
welfare
reports
or
the
reports
of
the
probation
officer
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
they're
available
to
in
almost
every
jurisdiction.
but
they're
also
--
before
the
determination
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
would
still
maintain
mr.
justice
white
that
when
you
are
determining
delinquency
with
the
loss
of
freedom
that
the
facts
have
to
be
stable.
i
--
i
don't
see
how
we
can
urge
the
contrary
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
the
recommendation
of
the
children's
bureau
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
that
the
notice
of
the
charge
about
the
telephone
call,
the
notice
of
the
possibility
that
he
was
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
determination
on
the
subsection
b
which
was
never
brought
before
him
at
any
time.
i
also
believe
the
notice
should
be
in
writing
and
i
believe
that
the
notice
should
be
given
to
the
child.
it's
his
interest
there
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
to
the
child
and
to
the
parents.
mr.
norman
dorsen
because
the
parent
has
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
true
but
in
this
case,
when
the
child
is
a
child
there
is
--
in
his
minority,
there
is
a
familial
relationship.
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
the
sense
that
maybe
more
rights
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
call
it
a
property
right
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
because
i
don't
believe
it's
a
property
right
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
believe
it's
the
parents
who
are
in
a
position
to
help
the
child.
i
believe
the
parents
have
a
child
and
a
family
relationship
and
i
believe
therefore
it
has
been
apparently
100%
of
the
jurisdictions
that
the
legal
aid
office
canvass,
100%
provide
notice
for
the
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right
sir.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
should
be
very
brief
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
on
your
two
questions
earlier,
the
request
for
mrs.
cook
came
at
the
second
hearing
and
that's
at
pages
35
and
36
of
the
record.
with
respect
to
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
judge
to
appoint
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
if
there's
any
meaning
in
parens
patriae,
this
seems
to
me
the
perfect
case
without
exercise,
with
that
discretion
should
have
been
exercised.
the
record
is
literally
teaming
with
unresolved
issues
and
i
can
understand
why
the
discretion
wasn't
exercised.
mr.
norman
dorsen
if
the
child
wants
counsel,
it's
his
right,
he
should
have
counsel.
mr.
norman
dorsen
or
the
question
would
be
under
the
cases
like
carnley
and
cochran
where
there
was
a
knowing
waver
of
a
right.
i
would
be
very
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
that's
the
point
i
was
just
going
to
make.
i
have
great
difficulties
of
seeing
how
the
child
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
i
would
not
go
that
far
unnecessarily.
i
think
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
certain
situations,
i
think
that
the
counsel
probably
could
represent
both
interests.
where
there
was
no
indication
for
example,
that
the
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
would
be
my
position,
mr.
justice
white.
i
might
add
that
as
mr.
young,
the
discretion
in
this
case
was
not
reviewable
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
the
wonder
of
the
case
absolute
discretion
is
a
ruthless
master.
it
is
more
destructive
of
freedom
than
any
of
man's
other
inventions
and
i
think
that
quote
is
quite
opposite
to
this
situation.
third,
on
the
fifth
amendment
point
would
rest
on
our
brief
but
we
believe
and
you
suggest
that
there
is
a
clear
case
of
possible
self-incrimination
under
the
arizona
code.
i
might
add
since
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
the
illinois
situation
that
illinois
was
the
first
state
to
past
legislatively
and
provisions
for
juvenile
court.
it
now
provides
for
two
hearings
as
i
suggested
new
york
does,
one
a
fact-finding
hearing
and
another,
a
dispositional
hearing
with
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
it
does
not.
finally,
i
want
to
deal
with
this
question
of
gerald
gault's
alleged
admissions.
i
want
to
be
as
clear
as
i
possibly
can
on
what
happened.
there
were
four
witnesses
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
the
first
witness
was
mrs.
gault.
she
said
specifically
that
there
was
no
admission
of
the
dirty
word
at
the
first
hearing.
and
that's
in
the
record
at
page
30.
she
did
not
testify
regarding
the
second
hearing.
mr.
gault
was
the
second
witness.
he
did
not
testify
regarding
the
first
hearing
because
he
was
not
present.
regarding
the
second
hearing,
he
denied
that
gerald
gault
admitted
saying
the
dirty
words
and
that's
at
page
24
of
the
record.
flagg
was
the
third
witness,
officer
flagg.
he
said
specifically
on
page
51
of
the
record
that
there
was
no
admission
of
the
language
during
the
custodial
stage
of
the
matter.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
custodial,
the
preliminary
stage
before
the
hearing
when
he
was
picking
up
gerald
gault.
he
said
that
gerald
did
not
admit
making
these
statements.
regarding
the
first
hearing
he
said
that
there
was
an
admission
inconsistently
with
mrs.
gault.
regarding
the
second
hearing,
he
said
that
there
was
no
admission.
judge
mcghee
was
the
final
witness.
he
said
as
to
both
juvenile
hearings
that
there
was
a
partial
admission
of
language
at
both
hearings
and
those
were
at
pages
58,
59,
and
61.
judge
mcghee
also
testified
at
page
59
and
70
of
the
record
that
he
was
not
satisfied
what
has
happened
at
the
first
hearing.
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
that
gerald
gault
specifically
admitted
making
those
statements.
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
did
not
testify
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
and
the
conflict
was
over
what
he
said
as
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
said.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
norman
dorsen
before
proceeding
to
the
argument,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to

the

of
the

mr.
norman
dorsen
application
of
gault,
number
116.
this
case
raises
important
constitutional
questions
concerning
the
extent
which
requirements
of
procedural
fairness
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
applicable
to
juvenile
proceedings.
appellants,
the
parents
of
gerald
francis
gault
claim
in
particular
that
the
arizona
juvenile
code
on
its
face
and
is
applied
in
this
case
is
invalid
and
failing
to
provide
the
following
basic
protection.
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
the
right
to
adequate
notice
of
the
charges
of
delinquency
including
time
to
prepare,
the
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
complainant,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
the
right
to
a
transcript
and
meaningful
judicial
review.
these
issues
which
we
do
raise
and
pass
on
below
will
be
taken
up
severely
in
due
course.
in
this
case,
gerald
gault
at
age
15
was
committed
for
the
period
of
his
minority
that
is
for
up
to
six
years
to
the
state
industrial
school
in
arizona
after
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings
consisting
of
two
hearings
in
the
superior
court
of
gila
county,
arizona.
this
appeal
is
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
a
collateral
action.
that
court
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
maricopa
county
superior
court
which
after
a
hearing
dismissed
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
filed
on
gerald's
behalf
by
his
parents
paul
and
marjorie
gault.
gerald
is
still
in
confinement
and
has
been
for
two-and-one-half
years.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple
and
yet
it
is
not
possible
to
be
confident
about
exactly
what
happened
with
the
original
proceedings.
the
reasons
is
that
although
there
were
two
hearings
leading
to
the
determination
of
gerald's
delinquency
and
his
commitment,
a
transcript
was
not
made
at
either
one.
the
facts
accordingly
are
based
on
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
maricopa
county
superior
court.
at
that
hearing,
it
appeared
without
dispute
that
in
the
morning
of
june
8,
1964,
gerald
gault
and
a
friend
ronald
lewis
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
sheriff's
office
of
gila
county
as
the
result
of
the
complaint
by
one
mrs.
cook,
a
neighbor
of
the
boys
about
an
allegedly
lewd
telephone
call.
gerald
at
this
time
was
on
six
months
probation
following
an
incident
in
february
1964.
at
that
time
he
was
with
another
boy
who
has
alleged
to
have
taken
the
wallet.
the
other
boy
was
confined
and
gerald
was
put
on
probation.
after
mrs.
cook's
complaint,
the
boys
were
taken
to
the
local
probation
office
pursuant
to
the
arizona
code.
the
probation
officers
flagg
and
henderson
who
have
the
authority
of
peace
officers
in
arizona
decided
to
detain
the
boys
for
delinquency
hearing.
and
flagg
interrogated
gerald
at
some
length
during
the
evening
of
june
8
and
the
morning
of
june
9.
no
notice
of
the
detention
or
charges
was
left
at
the
gault
home.
mrs.
gault
who
returned
form
work
at
6
pm
on
that
day,
june
8
was
informed
by
her
older
son,
through
neighbors,
that
gerald
was
detained.
and
she
then
went
to
the
detention
home.
there
she
was
told
by
probation
officer
flagg,
“of
the
general
nature
of
the
charges,”
and
that
a
hearing
would
be
held
the
following
day,
june
9.
no
written
notice
of
this
hearing
or
the
charges
was
given
to
mrs.
gault
at
any
time.
on
june
9,
a
petition
charging
gerald
with
being
a
delinquent
minor
was
filed
by
probation
officer
flagg
with
the
juvenile
court.
this
is
on
page
80
of
the
record
of
the
petition.
this
petition
was
filed
pursuing
to
the
arizona
juvenile
code.
in
the
arizona
juvenile
code,
a
delinquent
child
is
defined
in
section
8-2016
in
the
appellant's
brief
on
page
3a.
mrs.
gault
did
not
receive
notice
of
the
petition
and
did
not
see
it
until
august
17
when
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
was
held
in
maricopa
county.
a
juvenile
referral
report
an
internal
juvenile
court
document
prepared
by
the
probation
office
for
the
court
charged
gerald
with
making
lewd
phone
calls.
this
was
prepared
when
gerald
was
taken
into
custody
on
june
8,
was
completed
after
the
hearings
and
filed
with
the
juvenile
court
on
june
15.
it
too
was
not
brought
to
appellant's
notice
until
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
august
17.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
suggestion
has
been
made
mr.
justice
stewart
that
notice
was
given
to
mrs.
gault.
it
is
plain
from
the
record
that
no
notice
of
any
time
was
given
to
anyone
else
in
the
family
of
gault.
and
therefore
i
want
to
emphasize
the
extents
on
which
the
fact
showed
any
notice
of
any
kind
to
any
member
of
the
family.
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
juvenile
received
no
notice
whatsoever
as
far
as
the
record
shows.
there
was
discussion
with
the
juvenile
orally
and
he
may
have
known
the
general
tenor
of
the
charges
but
the
only
notice
that
was
given
that
was
discussed
in
the
record
and
discussed
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
with
the
oral
notice
given
to
mrs.
gault
on
the
evening
of
june
8.
on
june
9th,
the
initial
hearing
took
place
in
judge
mcghee's
chambers.
he
was
the
juvenile
judge.
present
with
gerald,
his
mother,
his
older
brother
lewis
and
mr.
flagg
and
mr.
henderson,
the
probation
officers.
no
one
was
sworn,
no
transcript
was
made,
and
neither
gerald
nor
mrs.
gault
was
represented
by
a
counsel
or
advised
of
any
right
to
counsel.
with
respect
to
gerald's
conduct
that
led
to
a
finding
of
juvenile
delinquency,
there
was
conflict
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
as
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
at
page
84
of
your
record,
“there
was
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
concerning
what
transpired
at
the
juvenile
hearing.
mrs.
gault
testified
in
response
to
the
judge's
questions
of
the
juvenile
hearing.
gerald
said
he
dialed
mrs.
c's
number,
asked
her
if
it
was
such
and
such
a
number
said,
there
was
a
friend
of
his
who
wanted
to
talk
to
her
then
handed
the
phone
to
ronald
who
made
lewd
remarks
--”
mr.
norman
dorsen
they're
on
page
79,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
referral
report.
officer
flagg
testified
that
at
the
juvenile
hearing
gerald
admitted
making
the
phone
call
and
using
some
of
the
obscene
language.
judge
mcghee
testified
that
gerald
admitted
using
some
lewd
words.
following
the
hearing
on
june
9th
judge
mcghee
continued
the
case
until
june
15
because
in
his
words,
“i
didn't
know
myself
what
i
was
going
to
do
because
i
was
not
satisfied
from
the
testimony
there
at
that
time.”
accordingly,
officer
flagg
did
some
more
investigating
until
the
11th,
he
testified,
“i
talked
to
jerry
more
to
see
if
he
would
tell
me
any
more.
i
talked
to
ronnie
lewis
some
more
looking
for
a
change
of
stories
perhaps.”
gerald
was
returned
home
on
june
11th
or
12th.
on
that
day
mrs.
gault
received
the
note
on
plain
white
pages
from
officer
flagg
which
said,
“mrs.
gault,
judge
mcghee
has
set
monday
june
15th
1964
at
11
am
as
the
day
and
time
for
further
hearings
on
gerald's
delinquency.”
signed,
flagg.
this
was
the
only
written
notice
of
any
kind
that
any
member
of
the
gault
family
received
concerning
this
matter
prior
to
the
determination
of
delinquency
and
a
commitment
of
gerald
to
the
industrial
school.
on
june
15th
the
second
hearing
was
held.
it
was
held
in
the
presence
of
gerald
and
both
of
his
parents,
officer
flagg
and
ronald
lewis,
the
other
boy
involved
in
the
incident
and
ronald's
father.
again,
neither
gerald
nor
his
parents
was
represented
by
a
counsel.
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
august
17
there
also
was
conflict
about
what
happened
at
the
juvenile
court
hearing
of
june
15,
again,
the
words
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
“it
was
a
further
conflict
in
the
evidence
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
concerning
the
testimony
at
the
second
juvenile
hearing.”
both
mr.
and
mrs.
gault
testified
that
no
one
accused
gerald
of
making
a
lewd
telephone
call,
and
also
said
that
gerald
admitted
nothing.
but
judge
mcghee
said
gerald
admitted
making
some
of
the
lewd
remarks
although
not
the
more
serious
ones.
at
this
hearing
flagg
supported
the
gault's
version
stating
that
neither
boy
admitted
making
the
actual
remark.
it
should
be
noted
that
mrs.
cook,
the
woman
who
had
complained
about
the
phone
call
was
not
present
or
called
as
a
witness
at
either
hearing.
officer
flagg
had
talked
to
her
over
the
telephone
on
june
9th
and
judge
mcghee
had
not
spoken
to
her
at
all
when
mrs.
gault
passed
the
judge
during
the
hearing
of
june
15
while
mrs.
cook
was
not
present
saying
that,
“she
wanted
mrs.
cook
present
so
she
could
see
which
boy
had
done
the
talking,
the
dirty
talking
over
the
phone.”
judge
mcghee
answered,
“she
didn't
have
to
be
present.”
on
june
15th,
judge
mcghee
handed
down
an
order
containing
no
findings
or
facts.
the
order
simply
states
that
after
a
full
hearing
and
due
deliberation
the
court
finds
that
the
said
minor
is
a
delinquent
child.
he
ordered
and
says
that
the
child's
own
good
and
the
best
interest
of
the
state
require
that
he
be
committed
to
the
state
industrial
school
for
the
period
of
his
minority
unless
sooner
discharged
by
due
process
of
law.
mr.
norman
dorsen
15
years
old.
in
his
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
the
judge,
judge
mcghee
indicated
that
there
were
several
bases
for
his
decision.
one
was
the
violation
of
section
13-37
of
the
arizona
criminal
code
which
is
contained
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
first
page.
this
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
use,
“vulgar,
abusive
or
obscene
language
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
or
child.”
a
delinquent
child
is
defined
by
the
juvenile
code
reproduced
to
page
3a
of
appellant's
brief
as
including
the
child
who
has
violated
the
law
of
the
state
such
as
the
section
i
have
just
quoted.
mr.
norman
dorsen
two
months
is
the
maximum
penalty
plus
a
fine.
mr.
norman
dorsen
up
to
six
years
mr.
justice
fortas.
judge
mcghee
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
personally
have
not
been
there
but
i
can
say
it's
a
school
where
delinquent
children
are
sent.
the
school
was
kept
under
the
control
of
a
board
of
supervisors.
the
boys
were
sent
up
there
and
sent
up
there
for
various
offenses
ranging
from
theft
to
a
lewd
telephone
call.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
just
delinquent
children.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
believe
it
is.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
they
can't
go
home,
that's
pretty
clear.
they
can't
go
home
until
there's
minority,
unless
the
board
of
governors
of
the
state
industrial
school
will
let
them
go
home.
the
boy
is
in
exclusive
control
over
this
board.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
absolutely
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
had
no
record
of
any
kind
except
for
the
first
allegation
that
i've
mentioned
except
for
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
judge
didn't
mentioned
at
the
time
that
he
reached
the
decision
as
i
was
just
about
to
mention
that
there
was
an
earlier
incident
in
1962
having
to
do
with
a
baseball
glove
that
someone
had
suggested
that
gerald
had
stolen
but
there
was
no
hearing
on
this
and
the
case
was
dropped
because
there
was
no
material
foundation
for
the
claim.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
there
was
nothing
else
beside
the
judge's
statements.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record.
judge
mcghee
testified
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
no
time
did
he
ever
advised
gerald's
parents
that
he
was
charged
with
violating
the
statute.
another
ground,
the
second
ground
on
which
the
judge
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
was
charged
with
being
a
delinquent
because
he
violated
that
statute.
that
was
the
first
ground
that
the
judge
stated.
the
second
ground
in
which
the
judge
considered
the
boy
delinquent
was
that
he
was
“habitually
involved
in
immoral
manners.”
and
in
this
he
was
referring
to
subsection
d
of
section
2016
of
the
juvenile
code.
the
exact
language
of
subsection
d
which
is
on
page
3
of
the
appendix
is
“a
child
who
habitually
so
deports
himself
as
to
injure
or
endanger
the
morals
or
health
of
himself
or
others.”
judge
mcghee
also
testified
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
there
was
“probably
another
ground
too.”
in
connection
with
the
ground
of
habitually
involved
in
immoral
manners
at
first
mentioned
of
which
was
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
the
judge
said
that
he
took
account
of
an
earlier
allegation
that
gerald
had
stolen
the
baseball
glove
from
another
boy
and
lied
about
it
to
the
police.this
allegation
was
contained
in
that
probation
office
referral
report
but
the
incident
was
never
made
the
subject
of
charges
in
juvenile
court
and
no
hearing
was
held
according
to
judge
mcghee
because
of
lack
of
material
foundation
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
is
not
in
this
record.
judge
mcghee
testified
to
this
but
it's
not
in
this
record
mr.
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
mentioned
this
fact
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
questioning
and
answers
of
gerald
by
the
court
at
the
two
hearings
led
to
his
adjudication
as
a
delinquent
and
his
commitment.
judge
mcghee
testified
as
follows
at
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
question:
“were
any
adult
witnesses
sworn
and/or
heard
against
the
boy
gerald
gault?”
answer:
“no,
it
was
all
in
my
mind,
done
upon
the
admissions
of
gerald
gault
and
at
no
point
was
gerald
informed
of
a
right
to
remain
silent.”
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
the
judge's
testimony,
judge
mcghee.
after
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
the
maricopa
county
superior
court
dismissed
the
petition,
discharged
the
writ
and
remanded
gerald
to
the
state
industrial
school.
the
superior
court
did
not
write
an
opinion.
an
appeal
from
this
decision,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
affirmed.
in
an
extensive
opinion
starting
at
page
83
of
the
record
it
dealt
with
each
of
the
constitutional
claims
there
are
the
subjects
of
this
appeal.
the
court
held
as
follows:
first,
regarding
notice
of
charges,
the
court
ruled
that
young
gault
received
adequate
notice
because
“mrs.
gault
in
the
exact
nature
of
the
charge
against
gerald
gault
from
the
day
he
was
taken
to
the
detention
home.”
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
believe
so.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
our
petition
is
that
there
was
no
adequate
notice
at
all
because
there
was
no
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
whether
it's
the
constitutional
part
and
the
adequacy,
it
seemed
to
me.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
that's
right
and
i
think
that's
true.
the
court
also
claimed
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
exact
language
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
94
of
the
record
and
the
top
of

we
find
the
petitioners
were
not
denied
due
process
of
law
and
the
court
goes
on
to
say
mrs.
gault
knew
the
exact
nature
of
the
charge
against
gerald
from
the
day
he
was
taken
to
the
detention
home.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
court
also
stated
with
respect
to
notice
the
following
rule
that
would
govern
in
the
future
that
the
infant
and
his
parents
or
guardian
will
receive
a
petition
only
reciting
a
conclusion
of
delinquency.
but
no
later
than
the
initial
hearing
by
the
judge
they
must
be
advised
with
the
fact
involved
in
the
case.
if
the
charges
are
denied
it
must
be
given
a
reasonable
period
of
time
to
prepare,
that's
at
92
in
the
record.
second,
with
respect
to
the
right
of
counsel,
the
court
below
held
although
parents
cannot
be
denied
representation
by
retained
counsel
due
process
does
not
require
that
an
infant
have
the
right
to
counsel.
the
court
held
further
that
gerald
was
not
denied
due
process
because
his
parents
“knew”
they
could
have
retained
counsel.
the
court
also
said
that
the
parents
and
the
probation
officer
may
be
relied
upon
to
protect
the
infant's
interest.
third,
with
respect
to
confrontation
and
cross-examination,
the
court
below
held
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
because
the
relevancy
of
confrontation
only
arises
with
the
charges
of
denial.
the
court
stated
that
the
parents
knew
they
could
have
called
witnesses
and
cross-examined
probation
officer
flagg.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
he
was.
as
far
as
i
know
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
record
showed
he
was
a
regular
member
of
the
superior
court
of
arizona.
mr.
norman
dorsen
sitting
in
his
juvenile
capacity
pursuant
to
the
juvenile
code.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
there
is
not.
it's
a
section
of
the
superior
court
and
sometimes
the
case
is
just
sent
to
referees.
mr.
norman
dorsen
with
respect
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
court
below
noted
the
division
of
authority
in
state
courts
of
whether
an
infant
had
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
a
right
to
be
advised
with
the
privilege.
the
court
then
held
that
the
necessary
flexibility
for
individualized
treatment
will
be
enhanced
by
a
rule
which
does
not
require
the
judge
to
advise
the
infant
of
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
fifth
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
right
of
transcript
and
appellate
review,
the
court
held
that
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
from
a
juvenile
court
order
and
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
transcript.
the
court
said
that
the
juvenile
court
has
discretion
to
order
or
deny
the
taking
of
the
transcript.
it
is
the
position
of
appellants
that
gerald
gault
was
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
in
the
juvenile
court
of
gila
county
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
before
proceeding
to
these
constitutional
questions
severely
it
maybe
helpful
if
i
very
briefly
outline
some
of
the
background
of
the
juvenile
court
problem.
prior
to
the
juvenile
court
movement
which
started
in
illinois
in
1899,
juveniles
were
treated
like
all
other
criminals.
at
least
all
other
criminal
defendants
except
for
capacity
problems
of
mens
rea
it
was
subject
to
the
criminal
law
and
they
received
the
existing
safeguards.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
know.
i
believe
it
was
a
common
law
rule
of
seven
but
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
is
that
correct
mr.
parks?
the
juvenile
court
movement
was
a
response
to
findings
of
social
science,
psychology,
social
welfare
and
to
new
theories
of
rehabilitation
that
flourished
to
the
turn
of
the
century.
accordingly,
juvenile
courts
were
established
beginning
in
1899
and
now
we
find
them
in
every
state
of
the
union.
the
proceedings
in
this
juvenile
courts
are
civil
not
criminal.
the
court
is
theoretically
engaged
in
determining
the
needs
of
the
child
and
of
society
rather
than
adjudicating
guilt
and
meeting
out
punishment.
the
courts
in
the
state
are
acting
as
parens
patriae
rather
than
prosecutors
or
judge,
treating
the
child
as
with
a
firm
but
benevolent
parents.
but
parens
patriae
and
individualized
justice
led
to
proceedings
in
juvenile
court
had
spent
with
certain
traditional
rights.
in
some
states,
court
have
ruled
that
juveniles
are
not
entitled
to
bail,
to
indictment,
to
speedy
in
public
trial,
to
confrontation
of
accuses,
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
the
right
to
counsel.
but
up
late
there
has
been
increasing
criticism
by
scholars
and
reexamination
by
courts.
questions
have
arisen
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
original
goals
of
juvenile
court
movements
and
especially
about
the
barter
of
alleged
special
treatment
for
constitutional
protection.
the
climax
came
last
year
in
kent
v.
united
states,
summing
up
the
present
situation,
the
court
said
as
follows,
“while
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
original
laudable
purpose
of
juvenile
courts,
studies
and
critiques
in
recent
years
raised
serious
questions
as
to
where
actual
performance
measures
well
enough
against
theoretical
purpose
to
make
power
to
the
immunity
of
the
process
from
the
reach
of
constitutional
guarantees
applicable
to
adults.
there
was
evidence
in
fact
that
there
may
be
grounds
for
concern
that
the
child
receives
the
worse
of
both
worlds.
that
he
gets
neither
the
protections
accorded
to
adults
nor
the
solicitous
care
and
regenerative
treatment
postulated
for
children.”
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
douglas.
and
i
would
--
in
the
intent
the
court
did
not
decide
these
questions
but
they
were
specifically
--
the
court
specifically
reserved
and
specifically
reserved
the
question
where
the
constitutional
guarantees
which
would
be
applicable
to
adults
must
be
applied
in
juvenile
court
proceedings.
this
case
presents
that
issue
in
the
five
specific
respects
i've
outlined
above.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
certain.
i
think
it
was
amended
1962
but
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
date
of
enactment,
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
many
of
them
do,
many
of
them
do
and
in
safeguards
specifically
some
of
them
are
provided
by
the
statute
and
some
are
provided
by
court
rule.
for
example,
i
was
about
to
turn
to
the
question
of
right
to
counsel
and
according
to
the
legal
aid,
the
national
legal
aid
and
advisers
brief,
78%
of
the
jurisdictions
in
which
legal
aid
operate
provide
a
right
to
counsel.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct,
under
the
recent
family
court
act,
new
york
has
provided
for
the
point
of
law
guardians
and
they
are
specifically
enjoined
with
responsibility
of
representing
children's
interest.
mr.
norman
dorsen
record
is
kept.
the
standards
of
the
--
that
have
been
promulgated
jointly
by
the
national
council
on
crime
and
delinquency
by
the
national
council
of
juvenile
court
judges
and
by
the
children's
bureau
of
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
also
provide
for
these
safeguards.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
have
seen
some
mr.
justice
fortas
and
we
submit
that
these
are
insufficient.
the
justifications
are
several.
one
is
the
justification
of
the
therapeutic
aid
or
the
individualized
justice
that
is
to
be
accorded
juveniles
but
of
course
in
this
case,
we
are
not
saying
anything
about
what
treatment
juveniles
should
receive
once
they
are
determined
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
page
18.
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
are
statutes.
california
for
example
goes
up
to
18
to
21.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
have
seen
no
satisfactory
explanation.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
we
reject
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
--
i
think
it
may
if
i
understood
exactly
what
it
meant
i
could
be
sure,
well
it's
obviously
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
that
argument
might
well
be,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
must
confess
that
it
may
well
be.
i
do
not
understand
it
because
i
--
no
matter
how
many
times
one
says
parens
patriae
i
think
there
is
a
small
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
but
that
may
well
be
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
the
argument
that
the
ohio
juvenile
court
judges
made
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
guess
that
is
it.
it's
of
course
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
mr.
chief
justice,
in
connection
with
the
question
of
justification
for
the
procedures
in
this
case
whether
considered
from
the
point
of
view
of
custody,
treatment,
therapeutic
gain.
appellants
would
like
to
stress
to
the
court
the
very
important
and
in
our
view
a
very
sharp
distinction
between
the
determination
of
delinquency
and
any
custodial
obligation
that
the
state
may
take
after
the
child
has
been
determined
to
be
delinquent.
there's
no
inconsistencies
in
our
view
between
having
the
kind
of
protections
that
we
are
suggesting
are
required
by
due
process
and
the
finest
custodial
and
treatment
processes
in
the
country.
just
two
weeks
ago
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
unanimously
reversed
a
juvenile's
case
in
determination
of
delinquency
and
judge
proctor
in
a
very
careful
opinion
said
assuming
a
juvenile
is
not
entitled
to
all
the
constitutional
requirements
of
the
criminal
trial,
we
firmly
believe
he
is
at
least
entitled
to
a
fact-finding
process
which
measures
up
to
the
essentials
of
due
process
and
a
fair
hearing.
and
in
this
connection
it
might
be
worth
knowing
that
new
york
and
its
recent
statute
has
specifically
provided
for
two
distinct
hearings
a
determination
of
delinquency
hearing
and
a
disposition
hearing
and
similar
standards
are
suggested
by
the
children's
bureau
of
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare,
the
juvenile
court
judges
and
the
national
council
for
crime
and
delinquency.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
new
york
provides
with
an
appointive
right
to
counsel
and
provide
for
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
provide
the
facts
upon
which
the
delinquency
is
alleged
to
have
occurred
or
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
child
and
they
provide
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
writing,
in
writing.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
not
an
open
hearing,
closed
hearing.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
jury
trial
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
norman
dorsen
a
right
of
review.
mr.
norman
dorsen
bergen,
new
york
is
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
arizona
it's
by
clearing
convincing
evidence.
confrontation
is
permitted
and
required
in
new
york.
in
fact,
they
go
so
far
as
to
say
specifically
in
the
statute
that
a
confession
made
out
of
the
court
is
not
admissible
as
the
soul
basis
for
finding
delinquency.
mr.
norman
dorsen
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
in
fact
there
was
an
earlier
case
in
1972,
the
lewis
case
which
was
in
the
sense
overruled
by
the
recent
changes
in
new
york
law.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
of
course
there
is
a
question
about
that
and
for
example
to
take
the
--
example,
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
there
are
certain
problems
of
confidentiality
that
would
seemed
to
be
applicable
in
the
case
of
the
child.
so
there
might
be
a
justification
for
keeping
such
a
proceeding.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
of
course,
those
haven't
been
tested
yet.
mr.
norman
dorsen
they
go
to
an
appellate
court
through
the
new
york
court
system.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
trial
de
novo
although
some
states
have
provided
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
norman
dorsen
not
in
new
york.
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
is
a
transcript.
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
we
would
suggest
that
the
best
part
namely
the
opportunity
for
the
state
in
the
case
where
a
child
has
been
properly
determined
to
be
a
juvenile
to
do
what
it
can,
to
treat
him,
to
take
care
of
him,
to
rehabilitate
him.
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
procedures
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
--
i
think
that
only
in
the
sense
that
children
are
in
a
more
formative
stage
and
that
the
theory
of
a
childcare
has
been
that
a
child
can
be
brought
along
in
a
different
way
than
adults
can
be.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
true.
unfortunately
the
system
has
developed
in
many
states
up
to
three
quarters
of
the
states,
it's
still
possible
for
juveniles
to
be
referred
to
regular
prisons
in
the
company
of
adult
criminals
and
this
is
pointed
out
in
the
health,
education
and
welfare
study
on
page
71.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
am
not
urging
that
position
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
would
distinguish
it
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
record
doesn't
present
the
question
from
the
point
of
view
that
the
child's
special
sensitivities
to
publicity,
special
stigma
that
might
attach
to
a
child,
the
child's
disorientation
before
a
the
public.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
sure
how
i
would
decide
that
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
have
thought
about
it
and
i
would
now
urge
the
court
to
take
the
position
that
a
public
trial
is
required.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
recent
harvard
study
cited
to
the
fact
that
the
fbi
is
given
all
reports
of
delinquency
or
at
least
a
large
number
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
as
far
as
i
know
they
do
even
though
the
arizona
code
purports
to
protect
the
juvenile
by
providing
for
destruction
of
all
records
within
two
--
or
after
two
years
following
his
release
from
confinement.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
include
the
hearing
on
disposition.
this
case
of
course
does
not
present
that
question.
it
would
depend
upon
which
aspect
of
the
hearing
on
disposition
are
you
referring.
for
example,
i
should
think
that
there
will
be
certain
types
of
evidence,
social
studies
of
the
child's
family
that
would
be
relevant
in
the
dispositional
hearing
that
wouldn't
be
relevant
with
the
determination
of
delinquency.
and
i
would
permit
that
evidence
to
be
introduced.
mr.
norman
dorsen
absolutely.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
the
way
i
would
put
it
myself
would
be
that
no
fact
that
the
judge
is
taking
account
of
in
determining
whether
to
dispose
the
child
one
way
or
another
should
be
left
undisclosed
to
the
child
in
his
counsel.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
think
i
would
go
that
far.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
don't
think
i
would
although
there
are
problems
about
that
because
of
the
right
to
counsel
problem.
for
example
in
this
case
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
i
think
you
do
because
i
think
that
in
this
case
for
example
even
before
the
hearing
there
was
a
question
of
when
the
child
was
going
to
admit
or
deny
the
charges
and
in
particular
with
respect
to
his
right
of
counsel
as
the
record
here.
i
think
very
dramatically
demonstrates,
when
this
child
did
not
deny
the
charges
against
him
at
the
first
opportunity
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
he
lost
the
right
at
that
point
to
an
adjudicative
hearing.
and
naturally
we
would
say
that
this
was
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
and
he
would
be
entitled
to
counsel.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
i
wouldn't
say
that.
but
i
do
recognize
mr.
justice
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
should
say
he
should
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
that's
right
although
i'm
not
taking
that
position
in
this
case.
i'm
taking
the
position
in
this
case
that
at
the
core
of
the
hearing
process
which
this
case
demonstrates,
the
counsel
is
certainly
necessary
and
the
amount
of
prejudice
that
this
record
seems
to
me
to
show
regarding
the
rights
of
this
boy
seems
to
me
to
be
conclusive
on
that
point.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
so
sure,
i
could
suggest
the
distinction
although
it
is
clear
not
only
because
the
question
wasn't
raised
but
because
the
question
in
this
case
could
not
have
been
raised.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
i've
answer
the
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
tried
to
answer
you
by
saying
that
i
can
think
of
no
distinction
if
there
is
a
delinquency
procedure
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
right.
i
tried
to
show
a
possible
distinction.
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out
that
there
may
be
problems
in
the
formulation
i
made.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
it
is
and
similarly
in
connection
with
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
would
not
draw
that
distinction
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
--
i
would
like
to
comment
if
i
may
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
proj
--
i
would
say
that
i
might
draw
though
of
a
child
--
between
a
child
of
eight
and
a
man
of
21.
i
might
think
of
a
way
in
which
that
the
proceeding
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
that
would
present
a
hard
question.
i
would
like
to
comment
though
on
a
question
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
raised
because
i
can
think
of
a
possible
ability
in
terms
of
having
welfare
workers
or
probation
officers
who
are
insulated
from
the
delinquency
hearing
who
are
insulated
from
the
adversary
system
dealing
with
the
boy
in
a
preliminary
stage
without
his
lawyer.
and
we
have
to
see
that
system
but
it
is
possible
for
me
to
conceive
of
the
system
without
welfare
worker
especially
if
the
boy
is
not
with
his
parents
dealing
with
him
on
a
confidential
and
private
basis.
but
that
would
be
a
very
specially
constructed
system
and
i
would
have
to
see
it
before
i
want
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
that
is
the
hard
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
black
have
expressed
the
opinion
and
i
could
see
a
distinction
being
made
between
an
8-year-old
boy
and
a
17-year-old
boy.
that
is
as
far
as
i
can
go
at
this
time
because
i'm
just
not
sure
if
i
would
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
well,
(inaudible)
case
disposed
of
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
certainly
would
say
it
would.
well
they'd
be
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
is
not
held
and
this
case
doesn't
present
it.
there
was
no
request
for
it.
the
facts
of
this
case
though
--
well,
i
would
like
now
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
me
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
because
this
record
as
i
tried
to
state
it
as
well
as
i
can
does
show
that
this
boy
was
prejudiced
in
countless
ways
not
only
because
of
the
absence
of
the
counsel
but
because
at
no
time
was
either
he
or
his
parents
informed
that
the
specific
charge
upon
which
the
judge
ultimately
made
a
decision.
if
a
lawyer
were
present
for
example,
the
lawyer
would
have
tried
to
establish
exactly
what
the
charge
was.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
a
judge
--
i
don't
think
it
was
entirely
clear,
because
he
said
at
one
point
that
on
page
61
of
the
record
that
there
was
probably
some
other
ground
for
the
decision.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
also
think
it's
important
to
stress
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
think
so
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
it
makes
it
different
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
it
substantially
different
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
is
that
if
certain
facts
which
are
alleged
to
be
true
by
the
state
are
going
to
be
taken
account
in
determining
whether
a
boy
is
going
to
be
judged
as
a
delinquent
and
his
freedom
taken
away,
those
facts
should
be
stated
in
advanced
specifically
and
a
few
times
where
a
preparation
for
the
case
can
be
made.
in
this
case,
the
notice
was
given
at
7:30
or
8
o'clock
in
the
evening
of
june
8
and
the
hearing
was
the
next
day.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct,
that
leads
in
their
brief
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
we
--
in
our
brief,
we'll
rest
in
our
brief
and
this
privilege
against
self-incrimination
point
and
the
point
related
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
the
brief
of
the
national
legal
aid
has
its
good
compilation
i
believe
it
has
been
made
in
this
field.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
it
does.
the
--
the
legal
aid
brief
points
out
with
respect
to
some
of
the
items
that
have
been
raised
this
morning
that
78%
of
the
jurisdictions
give
a
right
to
counsel,
89%
provide
confrontation
of
witnesses
and
70%
of
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
and
almost
90%,
i
believe,
a
right
to
an
appeal
and
comparably
5%
which
is
in
other
words,
this
is
a
--
it
has
come
to
be
recognized
over
the
past
few
years
and
if
you
discover
the
criticism
and
the
work
of
the
courts
that
these
rights
are
essential
there
are
no
way
you
can
be
consistent
with
the
therapeutic
and
dispositional
aspects
of
the
juvenile
proceeding
that
the
specific
facts
as
mr.
justice
fortas
stated
are
those
that
have
to
be
rebutted.
there
are
lawyers
as
essential
or
more
essential
in
juvenile
cases
than
it
is
with
adults.
even
under
the
rule
of
betts
v.
brady
under
the
fundamental
fairness
betts
v.
brady,
it
was
well
established
by
this
court
in
the
merely
and
other
cases
that
the
age
of
the
defendant
was
a
pertinent
fact
that
you
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
it
was
fundamentally
unfair
not
to
provide
him
with
a
lawyer.
our
position
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
isn't
--
it
is
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
like
to
answer
if
i
can.
74%
according
to
the
legal
aid
in
appendix
page
10a
of
the
legal
aid
brief,
74%
provided
it,
if
the
child
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
of
this
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
and
of
course
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
it's
very
plain
that
even
though
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
said
that
mrs.
gault
knew
of
her
right
to
retain
counsel,
that
is
far
from
providing
the
right
to
counsel
that
we
believe
the
constitution
requires.
first
of
all,
it's
gerald
gault's
right
--
we're
trying
to
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart
alluded
to
this
morning.
secondly,
the
right
we
believe
is
required
by
the
constitution
is
the
right
to
assign
counsel
if
the
boy
can't
afford
it.
instead,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
said
that
the
parents
or
the
probation
officer
can
be
--
can
act
as
a
counsel.
now,
of
course
if
the
parent
himself
were
before
the
court
is
a
defendant,
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
lawyer
because
on
the
theory
that
he
couldn't
defend
his
own
case
but
when
the
child
is
in
the
position
as
the
defendant,
when
the
child
is
before
the
court
with
up
to
six
years
of
his
freedom
to
be
lost,
somehow
the
arizona
supreme
court
finds
that
the
parent
can
satisfactory
act
on
behalf
of
the
child
as
the
lawyer
would
and
as
far
as
the
suggestion
that
officer
flagg
act
as
the
lawyer,
the
probation
officer
in
this
case
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
even
less
realistic
and
less
fair,
there's
a
flat
conflict
of
interest.
flagg
is
the
person
who
signed
the
petition.
he
signed
the
petition
on
behalf
of
the
state
in
which
he
said
that
he
is
informed
and
believes
and
therefore
alleges
that
gerald
gault
is
a
delinquent.
that's
on
page
80
of
the
record.
flagg
did
not
do
a
thing
for
gerald
gault.
it's
well
established
they
didn't
informed
gerald
gault
of
any
of
his
rights,
any
of
his
rights
throughout
the
proceeding.
instead,
what
he
did
try
to
do
was
to
get
a
change
of
story
as
the
record
points
out
on
page
49.
he
was
certainly
acting
as
an
adversary.
in
short,
our
position
is
with
respect
to
the
lawyer
--
with
respect
to
the
various
other
constitutional
protections
that
we
believe
to
be
fundamental
that
the
absence
of
a
lawyer
does
not
mean
that
we'll
have
a
harmonious
informal,
non-adversary
proceeding.
instead
it
means
that
we'll
have
a
one
sided
adversary
proceeding,
a
one-sided
adversary
proceeding
in
which
the
cards
are
stocked
against
the
child
from
beginning
to
end.
and
we
suggest
that
this
court
at
this
time
recognize
for
example
on
the
case
where
a
father
and
his
son
are
alleged
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
did
not
mean
and
i'd
like
to
answer
that
very
specifically
mr.
justice
i'm
not
suggesting
and
i
hope
my
words
are
not
taken
to
suggest
that
there's
any
intention
to
do
the
child
in.
we
--
i
said
at
the
beginning
and
i
would
like
to
reaffirm
that
the
purposes
of
these
acts
was
the
highest.
the
purposes
were
the
help
of
the
child.
the
problem
is
that
the
way
their
system
is
developed
as
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
said
just
the
other
day
that
fundamental
protections
are
essential.
i
think
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
--
i
should
believe
it
would
be
but
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
you
mean
looking
at
the
welfare
reports
or
the
reports
of
the
probation
officer
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
they're
available
to
in
almost
every
jurisdiction.
but
they're
also
--
before
the
determination
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
would
still
maintain
mr.
justice
white
that
when
you
are
determining
delinquency
with
the
loss
of
freedom
that
the
facts
have
to
be
stable.
i
--
i
don't
see
how
we
can
urge
the
contrary
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
the
recommendation
of
the
children's
bureau
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
that
the
notice
of
the
charge
about
the
telephone
call,
the
notice
of
the
possibility
that
he
was
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
determination
on
the
subsection
b
which
was
never
brought
before
him
at
any
time.
i
also
believe
the
notice
should
be
in
writing
and
i
believe
that
the
notice
should
be
given
to
the
child.
it's
his
interest
there
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
to
the
child
and
to
the
parents.
mr.
norman
dorsen
because
the
parent
has
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
true
but
in
this
case,
when
the
child
is
a
child
there
is
--
in
his
minority,
there
is
a
familial
relationship.
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
the
sense
that
maybe
more
rights
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
call
it
a
property
right
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
because
i
don't
believe
it's
a
property
right
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
believe
it's
the
parents
who
are
in
a
position
to
help
the
child.
i
believe
the
parents
have
a
child
and
a
family
relationship
and
i
believe
therefore
it
has
been
apparently
100%
of
the
jurisdictions
that
the
legal
aid
office
canvass,
100%
provide
notice
for
the
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right
sir.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
should
be
very
brief
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
on
your
two
questions
earlier,
the
request
for
mrs.
cook
came
at
the
second
hearing
and
that's
at
pages
35
and
36
of
the
record.
with
respect
to
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
judge
to
appoint
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
if
there's
any
meaning
in
parens
patriae,
this
seems
to
me
the
perfect
case
without
exercise,
with
that
discretion
should
have
been
exercised.
the
record
is
literally
teaming
with
unresolved
issues
and
i
can
understand
why
the
discretion
wasn't
exercised.
mr.
norman
dorsen
if
the
child
wants
counsel,
it's
his
right,
he
should
have
counsel.
mr.
norman
dorsen
or
the
question
would
be
under
the
cases
like
carnley
and
cochran
where
there
was
a
knowing
waver
of
a
right.
i
would
be
very
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
that's
the
point
i
was
just
going
to
make.
i
have
great
difficulties
of
seeing
how
the
child
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
i
would
not
go
that
far
unnecessarily.
i
think
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
in
certain
situations,
i
think
that
the
counsel
probably
could
represent
both
interests.
where
there
was
no
indication
for
example,
that
the
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
would
be
my
position,
mr.
justice
white.
i
might
add
that
as
mr.
young,
the
discretion
in
this
case
was
not
reviewable
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
the
wonder
of
the
case
absolute
discretion
is
a
ruthless
master.
it
is
more
destructive
of
freedom
than
any
of
man's
other
inventions
and
i
think
that
quote
is
quite
opposite
to
this
situation.
third,
on
the
fifth
amendment
point
would
rest
on
our
brief
but
we
believe
and
you
suggest
that
there
is
a
clear
case
of
possible
self-incrimination
under
the
arizona
code.
i
might
add
since
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
the
illinois
situation
that
illinois
was
the
first
state
to
past
legislatively
and
provisions
for
juvenile
court.
it
now
provides
for
two
hearings
as
i
suggested
new
york
does,
one
a
fact-finding
hearing
and
another,
a
dispositional
hearing
with
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
it
does
not.
finally,
i
want
to
deal
with
this
question
of
gerald
gault's
alleged
admissions.
i
want
to
be
as
clear
as
i
possibly
can
on
what
happened.
there
were
four
witnesses
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
the
first
witness
was
mrs.
gault.
she
said
specifically
that
there
was
no
admission
of
the
dirty
word
at
the
first
hearing.
and
that's
in
the
record
at
page
30.
she
did
not
testify
regarding
the
second
hearing.
mr.
gault
was
the
second
witness.
he
did
not
testify
regarding
the
first
hearing
because
he
was
not
present.
regarding
the
second
hearing,
he
denied
that
gerald
gault
admitted
saying
the
dirty
words
and
that's
at
page
24
of
the
record.
flagg
was
the
third
witness,
officer
flagg.
he
said
specifically
on
page
51
of
the
record
that
there
was
no
admission
of
the
language
during
the
custodial
stage
of
the
matter.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
custodial,
the
preliminary
stage
before
the
hearing
when
he
was
picking
up
gerald
gault.
he
said
that
gerald
did
not
admit
making
these
statements.
regarding
the
first
hearing
he
said
that
there
was
an
admission
inconsistently
with
mrs.
gault.
regarding
the
second
hearing,
he
said
that
there
was
no
admission.
judge
mcghee
was
the
final
witness.
he
said
as
to
both
juvenile
hearings
that
there
was
a
partial
admission
of
language
at
both
hearings
and
those
were
at
pages
58,
59,
and
61.
judge
mcghee
also
testified
at
page
59
and
70
of
the
record
that
he
was
not
satisfied
what
has
happened
at
the
first
hearing.
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
that
gerald
gault
specifically
admitted
making
