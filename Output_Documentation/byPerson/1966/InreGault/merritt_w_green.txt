mr.
merritt
w.
green
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
mr.
parks
was
kind
enough
to
relinquish
some
of
his
time
to
me
that
i
might
talk
with
you
on
this
amicus
on
behalf
of
the
juvenile
judges
association
of
the
state
of
ohio.
there's
certainly
no
purpose
for
me
to
walk
over
the
ground
to
spend
trying
the
work
done
by
the
counsel
before
me.
i
think
my
role
here
is
that
i
did
concede
my
role
here
as
that
of
voicing
my
concern
on
behalf
of
those
people,
thousands
of
people
who
preside
over
and
worked
within
the
framework
of
the
juvenile
court
system
that
a
decision
does
not
come
from
this
case
which
would
in
effect
wipe
out
our
present
juvenile
court
structures
--
procedural
structures.
i
think
that
concern
arose
out
of
the
trust
that
was
in
the
brief
and
in
the
argument,
i
believe,
of
the
appellant,
which
in
effect
asked
this
court
to
impose
upon
the
juvenile
court
procedures
the
doctrines
that
the
court
has
laid
down
in
gideon,
escobedo,
miranda
and
so
forth
to
apply
those
to
delinquency
cases.
it's
easy
to
come
confused
in
that
distinguishing
is
that
if
you
can
distinguish
between
felonies
misdemeanors
and
delinquencies,
the
state
legislatures
on
all
50
states
i
believe
having
their
wisdom
in
defining
what
--
how
they're
going
to
treat
transgressions
of
the
rules
of
good
conduct
in
order
that
our
society
require
to
setup
classes
of
these
transgressions
as
felonies,
misdemeanors
and
delinquencies.
now,
we
have
always
within
this
framework
of
the
juvenile
court
system
had
always
i
may
say
it
this
way
not
considered
what
would
ordinarily
be
a
crime
if
committed
by
adult,
a
crime
if
done
by
a
youngster.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right
sir.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
that's
right,
you
see
this
may
be
an
oversimplication
of
statement
but
the
delinquency
is
not
a
crime.
children
do
not
commit
crimes,
they
become
delinquent
and
they
are
not
treated
as
crimes
until
the
court
that
has
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
releases
them
to
the
adult
court
to
be
tried
as
an
adult
would
be
tried
as
in
the
kent
case.
the
court
will
remember
that
in
the
kent
versus
united
states
case,
the
court,
i
believe,
recognized
that
the
juvenile
court
system
was
of
such
--
well,
i
think
the
court
says
that
in
that
case
that
the
child
was
entitled
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
juvenile
court
and
it's
attending
protections.
and
that
when
the
court
considered
that
they
should
whether
or
not
this
boy
should
have
been
treated
as
a
--
tried
as
a
criminal
that
that's
where
it
became
as
such
vital
importance
that
all
of
these
constitutional
protections
such
as
hearing
and
notice
of
those
things
should
be
carried
out.
now,
as
i
say
from
the
standpoint
of
a
meek
issue,
we
are
looking
at
this
i'm
frank
to
say
in
the
practical
aspect
of
it.
while
on
this
particular
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
i'm
just
--
i'm
not
calling
one
a
crime
and
not
the
other
crime.
i'm
just
saying
that
under
our
concept
of
the
treatment
of
juveniles
all
of
the
50
legislates
--
legislatures
all
in
the
50
states
have
said
transgressions
which
would
otherwise
be
misdemeanors
or
felonies
have
committed
by
adults
are
not
crimes
and
therefore
the
special
treatment
is
given
to
them
because
actually
mr.
justice
fortas
that
--
the
mere
fact
that
this
boy
was
brought
in
for
this
particular
thing
even
though
he
was
on
probation
does
not
in
and
of
itself
say
that
he
is
going
to
be
sent
away.
you
see,
as
i
--
see
if
these
three
steps
in
the
juvenile
court
proceedings,
there's
the
intake
proceeding,
the
adjudication
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
he
really
is
a
delinquent
and
then
the
next
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
or
decided
on
that.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
this
case
or
any
other
case
which
would
prohibit
that.
i
think
again
i
think
we
have
to
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don't
believe
the
arizona
statutes
prohibit
those
things.
i
know
in
my
own
state,
you're
entitled
to
counsel,
you're
entitled
to
hearing.
if
you
want
a
transcript,
you
can
ask
the
court
to
take
a
transcript.
you
see,
i
don't
think
anybody
questions
any
of
the
three
of
us,
that
juveniles
are
not
entitled
to
the
full
measure
of
due
process.
again,
it's
within
the
area
of
the
specialized
treatment
as
to
what
amounts
the
due
process
in
relation
to
what
is
best
for
this
youngster.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
we
all
--
i
think
all
of
the
courts
and
all
of
us
here
would
say
that
due
process
is
certainly
should
be
accorded
to
juveniles.
there
is
no
need
for
criminal
cases.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
oh!
i
don't
believe
--
i
accept
that
--
i
don't
know
--
no,
due
process
--
due
process.
i
think
due
process
is
essential
fairness
for
anybody
and
everybody.
now,
what
--
due
process
under
certain
circumstances
may
be
different.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
it's
a
hard
and
fast
rule
that
due
process
is
this
in
every
case.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i
think
those
are
all
subject
to
scrutiny.
that's
why
were
here.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i
think
adequate
notice.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
adequate
notice,
yes.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i
think,
yes.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
constitutional
protections
against
those
things
apply
in
where
its
person
is
charged
of
the
crime.
now
again,
if
we're
going
to
do
all
those
things
in
the
concept
of
the
cases
i
have
mentioned
that
applied
it
does,
then
we're
going
to
have
to
say
that
delinquency
is
just
another
name
for
crimes
and
that
that
is
the
fact
is
not,
they
are
crimes
and
then
therefore
all
the
constitutional
guarantee
should
apply
in
every
respect
that
you
have
mentioned
here
today
and
as
was
outlined
in
the
kent
for
instance
where
you
declined
--
that
time,
i
believe,
the
court
declined
to
accept
the
invitation.
i
agree
to
that.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yeah,
but
children
are
not
adults.
i
think
we
recognize,
in
this
society
that
there
certain
restraints,
certain
that
must
be
on
children
and
that
some
children
thereby
reason
of
certain
circumstances
require
restraints,
guidance,
training
over
and
beyond
then
that
role
that
they
get
within
an
actual
custody
of
their
family.
and
now
the
family
certainly
is
the
natural
custodian
of
the
children.
and
i
think
maybe
that's
where
we
get
in
a
matter
of
semantics
here
as
to
what
is
the
difference?
well,
there
is
a
difference
between
adults
and
children.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
if
denied
--
if
the
act
is
denied
by
the
juvenile,
most
assuredly.
well,
i
would
say
that
a
child
--
that
the
court
may
in
determining
whether
or
not
delinquency
is
present
and
at
certain
case
can
take
the
statement
of
the
child
whether
he
gave
it
them
in
court
or
to
a
policeman
or
something
like
that.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
i
can't
speak
for
them
and
they
were
asked
to
command
amicus
but
because
of
the
power
structure,
the
organizational
structure
they
couldn't
get
together
the
information
to
file
an
application.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
sir?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
as
to
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
do
they
all
agree?
well,
there
may
be
some
who
agree
to
that,
some
of
these
guarantees
should
not
extend
as
strictly
as
i
say
that
they
should
be
extended
or
it's
just
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that
none
of
them?
well
i
can't
say.
i
don't
know
because
i
don't
know
all
the
members
of
the
association.
i
wouldn't
have
anyway
in
knowing
that.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
that's
right.
i
think
they
agree
that
this
treatment
of
juveniles
is
really
different
than
the
treatment
of
adult
as
criminals.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
mr.
parks
was
kind
enough
to
relinquish
some
of

to

that
i
might
talk
with
you
on

on

association

there's

no

to

in

i

of

assuredly.
well,
i
would
say
that
a
child
--
that
the
court
may
in
determining
whether
or
not
delinquency
is
present
and
at
certain
case
can
take
the
statement
of
the
child
whether
he
gave
it
them
in
court
or
to
a
policeman
or
something
like
that.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
i
can't
speak
for
them
and
they
were
asked
to
command
amicus
but
because
of
the
power
structure,
the
organizational
structure
they
couldn't
get
together
the
information
to
file
an
application.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
sir?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
as
to
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
do
they
all
agree?
well,
there
may
be
some
who
agree
to
that,
some
of
these
guarantees
should
not
extend
as
strictly
as
i
say
that
they
should
be
extended
or
it's
just
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that
none
of
them?
well
i
can't
say.
i
don't
know
because
i
don't
know
all
the
members
of
the
association.
i
wouldn't
have
anyway
in
knowing
that.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
that's
right.
i
think
they
agree
that
this
treatment
of
juveniles
is
really
different
than
the
treatment
of
adult
as
criminals.
