justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
penalty
for
the
commission
at
that
crime
by
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
boy
got
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
can't
--
why
can't
they
go
home?
justice
abe
fortas
and
his
parents
are
deprived
of
it?
justice
abe
fortas
this
boy
has
--
does
this
boy
has
any
record
other
than
this
first
business
which
he
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
other
than
the
judge's
statement
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
is
that
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
but
sir,
what
is
the
rule
in
arizona
if
you
professor
dorsen
as
to
the
age
of
competency?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
dorsen,
i
have
a
question
with
you.
professor
dorsen
have
you
seen
a
theoretical
articulation
of
the
basis
for
reading
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
so
as
to
care
about
juveniles.
what
is
the
theoretical
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
to
state
passed
the
statute
applicable
to
the
handouts
which
attract
the
whole
of
these
and
the
state
declared
that
narrowing
the
state
as
parens
patriae
of
adults
and
nobody
is
going
to
be
sent
to
jail
they're
just
going
to
be
send
to
industrial
homes
and
there
they
will
be
well
fed,
well
shod,
and
well
clothed
but
they
can't
get
out.
now,
how
do
you
--
how
would
one
dispose
with
that
and
distinguish
that
from
the
case
turn
i
suppose
we'd
all
agree
on
and
that
is
no
excuse
for
depriving
of
people
of
constitutional
guarantees.
now,
what
is
the
basis
for
distinguishing
between
that
and
in
the
case
of
juveniles?
the
arizona
statute
goes
up
to
page
21.
justice
abe
fortas
18.
justice
abe
fortas
yeah,
alright,
18.
now,
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
that
an
18-year-old
boy
can
be
deprived
of
constitutional
guarantee
and
parens
patriae
theory.
but
that
state
couldn't
go
through
the
parens
patriae
formula
and
prior
to
that
are
constitutional
guarantees.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
dorsen,
your
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
your
theory
here
applies
only
to
the
delinquency
part
of
the
work
of
the
juvenile
court.
justice
abe
fortas
i
might
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
dorsen,
how
much
is
left
to
this
confidentiality
of
the
juvenile
proceedings?
the
--
the
draft
authorities
have
accessed
the
juvenile
records.
justice
abe
fortas
don't
--
does
the
fbi
have
access
to
it
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
police
authorities
and
the
same
jurisdiction
have
access
to
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wondered
whether
all
these
business
about
confidentiality
of
this
record
really
isn't
confidentiality
for
purposes
of
taking
the
parents
and
criticism
and
if
it
really
has
--
if
there's
really
much
left
of
it
so
far
as
the
child
is
concerned.
justice
abe
fortas
probably,
mr.
dorsen
there
agrees
what
is
a
public
crime
and
that
one
might
very
well
take
position
that
the
trial
so
to
speak
of
a
juvenile
in
the
judge's
chambers
with
nobody
there
but
the
juvenile
and
the
judge
would
be
a
constitutional
and
offensive
but
that
perhaps
a
trial
from
which
the
general
newspaper
reporters
and
general
public
were
excluded
might
not
be
constitutionally
offensive
and
somewhere
in
there,
isn't
that
possible?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
is
some
opinion
to
the
effect
that
even
on
the
case
of
adults
you
don't
have
a
television
camera
in
the
courtroom
and
make
it
a
public
trial,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
still
know
--
i'm
still
not
clear.
are
you
mr.
dorsen?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
and
the
determination
of
delinquency
as
i
understand
it
taken
the
account
not
only
a
specific
incident
had
issue
but
also
the
lawyer's
record?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
mr.
dorsen,
the
theory
is
that
there
are
specific
incidents
from
which
the
finding
of
delinquency
has
to
be
made
not
some
general
amorphous
reaction
to
the
boy.
but
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
one
immediate
incident
named
the
telephone
call.
there
was
this
reference
to
the
purse
taking
by
the
boy's
companion
at
which
gault
in
the
south
was
present
and
then
there
is
this
vague
reference
to
an
incident
involving
a
baseball
glove.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
it,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
illuminates
what
that
baseball
glove
incident
was
and
nothing
beyond
their
words
of
the
report
with
respect
to
the
first
taking.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
not
talking
about
at
least
a
constitutional
right.
justice
abe
fortas
at
least.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
hope
let's
assume
that
can
be
broken
down
a
little
bit.
will
it
interfere
with
individualized
treatment
in
the
arizona
conception
for
the
child
and
the
parent
to
be
given
a
written
notice?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
then
appears
with
the
individualized
treatment
for
the
counsel
to
be
provided
to
them.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
--
all
right,
i
will
just
like
to
get
less
from
here.
so
you
think
that
maybe
it
would
interfere
with
individualized
treatment
of
the
counsel
appointed
for
the
child.
justice
abe
fortas
as
far
as
the
child
were
told,
were
given
warnings
you
didn't
have
to
say
anything
and
if
they
did
say
anything
it
could
be
used
against
you.
do
you
think
that
will
interfere
with
individualized
treatment?
in
other
words,
if
he
is
given
an
opportunity
to
avoid
self-incrimination,
will
that
interfere
with
individualized
treatment?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
it
would?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
bad.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
appellate
review,
will
that
interfere
with
individualized
treatment?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
asking
that,
i
said
would
it
interfere
with
the,
what
you
say
is
arizona's
objective
which
is
individualized
treatment
providing
a
right
to
appeal
or
right
to
review.
would
that
interfere
with
the
individual?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
about
confrontation?
the
requirement
that
the
accusing
witness
testified
in
front
of
the
child
or
the
child's
counsel
or
child's
parent
or
all,
would
that
interfere
with
the
individualized
treatment?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
that
is
a
requirement?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
construe
this
record,
is
this
a
null
or
--
(voice
overlap)
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
yeah,
but
usually,
the
criminal
case
unless
there
is
a
clear
admission
case
proceeds
as
if
there
had
been
on
a
not
guilty
claim,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
it
in
your
view.
that
carried
one.
do
you
agree
that
confrontation
in
the
case
of
the
juvenile
is
a
constitutional
necessity
where
there
is
a
denial?
justice
abe
fortas
well
unless
you're
going
to
confess
here
than
you
have
to
take
the
position
that
the
gerald
gault
did
not
deny
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
act
of
which
your
complaint
was
made
here.
but
on
the
other
hand
he
didn't
admit
it,
did
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
get
back
to
the
other
point,
if
you
think
that
confrontation
where
the
boy
denies
guilt
would
not
negate
individualized
treatment,
why
is
it
that
you're
so
worried
about
self-incrimination
by
telling
the
boy
that
he
has
got
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
thought
you
said
that
was
alright
where
the
child
denies
guilt
that
you
thought
there
was
an
essential
element
of
fairness?
justice
abe
fortas
it
may
not
be
depending
on
how
one
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
they
know
they
would
establish
anything
by
declaring
convincing
evidence
sort
of
giving
--
providing
fundamental
due
process?
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
reading
was
sort
of
lesson
as
applied
to
juveniles
in
the
state
of
arizona.
justice
abe
fortas
extremely
low
means
what,
supplement
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
mean
40%,
50%?
justice
abe
fortas
why
did
the
state
in
its
capacity
as
parens
patriae
on
this
15-year-old
boy,
pick
him
up
and
put
him
in
the
receiving
home?
was
there
any
indication
that
he
was
about
to
plead
the
jurisdiction
or
would
not
be
available
for
trial?
was
the
warrant
obtained
as
the
record
show
what
information
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
this
supposedly
benevolent
parens
patriae,
the
state
picks
the
boy
up
and
puts
him
on
the
--
well
in
most
jurisdictions
one
would
have
to
say
is
whimsically
called
a
receiving
home.
i
don't
know
your
institute
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
congratulate
you
up
here
relatively
unique.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
routine,
isn't
it?
when
the
child
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
with
a
delinquency
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
it's
not?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
--
was
that
ever
approved
when
they
boy
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record?
was
there
anything
before
a
judge
saw
that
shows
that
that
was
proved?
that
the
boy
stole
the
baseball
glove?
is
there
anything
you
saw
with
the
circumstances
where
that
he
picked
it
up
on
the
baseball
field
and
he
break
into
the
store?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
then
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
even
the
judge
then
say
exactly
what
happened
in
this?
justice
abe
fortas
someone
--
well,
i
am
aware
of
knowing
that
that's
so
or
that
it's
not
so.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
based
on
what
you
say
and
what
happened
here
is
it
that
was
an
important
part,
it's
unwritten
and
unknown
perhaps
so
far
as
we
know,
unadmitted
and
unproved
incident
as
part
of
the
reason
for
putting
the
boy
in
detention
for
a
maximum
of
six
years
for
an
offense
which
he
have
committed
by
or
as
a
--
the
immediate
consequence
of
an
offense
which
is
committed
by
an
adult
would
have
resulted
in
the
maximum
of
two
months
imprisonment,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
forgive
me,
i'll
leave
you
alone
for
this.
but
so
far
as
this
record
shows
on
that
grand
theft
incident,
the
only
thing
that
we
have
is
a
scrap
of
paper
reproduced
in
this
record
that
shows
that
he
was
in
the
field
along
with
another
boy
and
that
the
other
boy
took
the
pocketbook,
is
my
recollection
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
all
we
know,
that
that
appears
on
this
sheet
of
paper.
we
don't
know
whether
the
boy
himself
was
culpable,
what
the
degree
of
culpability
was
when
he
participated
in
taking
it
or
whether
he
was
just
along
with
the
boy
and
now
the
representation
is
i
don't
--
maybe
it's
yours
but
basically
this
whole
theme,
it
has
said
that
the
state
as
i
think
is
parens
patriae,
the
exact
thing
as
sort
of
a
forced
father
of
this
boy.
and
one
of
the
things
that
it
takes
into
account
is
a
record
statement
that
the
boy
was
along
with
another
boy
in
the
movie
theater
and
the
other
boy
took
the
pocketbook.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
judge
didn't
say
it
in
fatherly
manner.
justice
abe
fortas
in
arizona
do
you
make
--
is
it
appropriate
or
permissible
to
make
a
finding
of
delinquency
on
the
basis
just
in
the
admissions
of
the
juvenile?
you
have
set
the
admissions
without
corroboration?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that's
what
this
case
stands
for?
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
a
rule
on
other
jurisdictions
is
entirely
in
effect
that
admissions
have
to
--
of
juveniles
have
to
be
corroborated
before
they
would
be
accepted
as
a
basis
for
--
justice
abe
fortas
with
what?
justice
abe
fortas
what
records
are
destroyed
though?
now,
here
is
a
case
where
a
boy
might
have
been
kept
in
custody
for
six
years.
and
you
certainly
don't
destroy
all
records
after
two
years.
what
is
destroyed
and
what
remains?
there
must
be
some
record
that
gerald
gault
was
subject
to
this
court
order
that
would
survive
for
the
six-year
period.
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
mean
now
that
this
would
be
destroyed
after
he
gets
to
be
21
with
gerald
gault
unless
he
gets
an
absolute
discharge
prior
to
that
time.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
you
construe
that
as
meaning
all
records
including
the
records
of
this
man
in
the
institution?
is
that
the
way?
justice
abe
fortas
just
that
with
the
proceeding.
but
the
fact
that
he
have
been
there
presumed
they
would
still
remain
on
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
told
compliment
in
terms
of
we've
been
talking
and
they
say
that
they
still
be
--
presumably
still
would
be
a
record
that
the
boy
was
sent
to
the
institution
for
such
and
such
a
period
for
such
and
such
on
such
and
such
a
basis.
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
green,
the
distinction
between
misdemeanors
and
felonies
is
based
on
some
difference
in
the
elements
of
the
act.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
the
distinction
between
delinquency
and
on
the
one
hand
felonies
and
misdemeanors
on
the
other
hand
may
or
may
not
be
based
on
the
difference
in
the
elements
of
the
act.
justice
abe
fortas
it
might
be
based
merely
on
the
fact
that
who
doesn't
whether
he's
18
years
old
or
19
years
old.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
difference
mr.
green,
here's
a
boy
and
let's
suppose
that
he
telephoned
this
lady
and
said
some
lewd
things
over
the
telephone.
he
was
picked
up
and
then
he
has
this,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
hearing
or
whatnot
and
the
end
of
it
is
that
he
is
to
send
away
for
maximum
of
six
years.
now,
if
an
adult
that
had
done
exactly
the
same
thin,
he
would
have
been
arrested.
he
would
have
been
tried.
he
would
have
been
given
due
process.
he
would
have
a
right
against
self-incrimination.
he
would
have
had
the
possibility
of
appeal.
there
would
have
been
transcript.
there
would
have
been
notice
in
writing.
the
burden
would
have
been
on
the
state
to
establish
his
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
there
would
have
been
confrontational
witnesses
all
because
he's
an
adult
and
the
most
he
could
have
been
put
away
for
is
two
months.
now,
here's
a
boy
that
gets
picked
up
and
he
gets
none
of
these
safeguards.
no
confrontational,
most
certainly
this
is
at
the
very
least
of
the
monthly
record
as
to
whether
he
admitted
his
--
that
he
did
it.
and
he
gets
sent
up
for
maximum
possibility
of
being
deprived
of
his
freedom
for
six
years
and
why
you
call
one
a
crime
and
not
the
other
one
a
crime?
justice
abe
fortas
but
one
--
one
of
the
questions
here
is
very
simply
put.
if
this
boy
was
sent
away
for
the
three
incidence
that
have
been
here
mentioned,
the
baseball
glove
incident,
and
whatever
that
was,
the
pocketbook
instance
whatever
that
was,
and
the
present
incident.
what
is
there
in
the
juvenile
court
fair
philosophy?
what
is
there
in
the
theory
of
the
juvenile
court
which
makes
it
undesirable
or
impossible
for
this
boy
to
have
had
the
basic
elements
of
a
trial
with
respect
to
those
incidents
so
that
at
least
he
would
have
known
and
we
would
know,
reviewing
courts
would
know
exactly
what
these
incidents
were,
what
happened,
why
this
boy
was
sent
away
for
six
years.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
doing
that
would
destroy
the
juvenile
court
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
green,
you
don't
say,
do
you,
that
due
process
is
what
the
juvenile
court
judge
says
it
is
in
the
particular
case
period
and
that's
the
end
of
the
definition.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
well
do
you
say
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
does
this
include
then?
i
mean
say,
if
you
say
it's
not
something
more
than
what
the
juvenile
court
judge
decides
in
this
particular
case,
would
it
include
a
notice
in
writing?
justice
abe
fortas
adequate
notice.
justice
abe
fortas
would
it
include
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
would
it
include
a
warning
about
the
--
and
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination,
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
get
any
words
by
trying
to
solve
these
problems
in
terms
of
the
use
of
the
word
like
‘crime’
or
‘not
crime’.
i
mean
the
question
is
we're
dealing
with
proceedings
here
in
which
the
persons
maybe
deprived
of
their
liberty
to
put
into
a
place
24
hours
a
day.
they're
in
custody
and
you
can
call
it
a
crime
or
you
can
call
it
(inaudible)
but
it
still
deprives
the
liberty.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
and
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
difference
between
a
man
and
a
woman.
mr.
green
let
me
just
ask
you
one
more
and
then
i'll
leave
you
alone.
how
about
confrontation?
would
you
consider
that
the
right
to
confrontation
is
part
of
due
process
for
juveniles?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
penalty
for
the
commission
at
that
crime
by
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
boy
got
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
can't
--
why
can't
they
go
home?
justice
abe
fortas
and
his
parents
are
deprived
of
it?
justice
abe
fortas
this
boy
has
--
does
this
boy
has
any
record
other
than
this
first
business
which
he
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
other
than
the
judge's
statement
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
is
that
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
but
sir,
what
is
the
rule
in
arizona
if
you
professor
dorsen
as
to
the
age
of
competency?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
dorsen,
i
have
a
question
with
you.
professor
dorsen
have
you
seen
a
theoretical
articulation
of
the
basis
for
reading
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
so
as
to
care
about
juveniles.
what
is
the
theoretical
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
to
state
passed
the
statute
applicable
to
the
handouts
which
attract
the
whole
of
these
and
the
state
declared
that
narrowing
the
state
as
parens
patriae
of
adults
and
nobody
is
going
to
be
sent
to
jail
they're
just
going
to
be
send
to
industrial
homes
and
there
they
will
be
well
fed,
well
shod,
and
well
clothed
but
they
can't
get
out.
now,
how
do
you
--
how
would
one
dispose
with
that
and
distinguish
that
from
the
case
turn
i
suppose
we'd
all
agree
on
and
that
is
no
excuse
for
depriving
of
people
of
constitutional
guarantees.
now,
what
is
the
basis
for
distinguishing
between
that
and
in
the
case
of
juveniles?
the
arizona
statute
goes
up
to
page
21.
justice
abe
fortas
18.
justice
abe
fortas
yeah,
alright,
18.
now,
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
that
an
18-year-old
boy
can
be
deprived
of
constitutional
guarantee
and
parens
patriae
theory.
but
that
state
couldn't
go
through
the
parens
patriae
formula
and
prior
to
that
are
constitutional
guarantees.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
dorsen,
your
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
your
theory
here
applies
only
to
the
delinquency
part
of
the
work
of
the
juvenile
court.
justice
abe
fortas
i
might
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
dorsen,
how
much
is
left
to
this
confidentiality
of
the
juvenile
proceedings?
the
--
the
draft
authorities
have
accessed
the
juvenile
records.
justice
abe
fortas
don't
--
does
the
fbi
have
access
to
it
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
police
authorities
and
the
same
jurisdiction
have
access
to
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wondered
whether
all
these
business
about
confidentiality
of
this
record
really
isn't
confidentiality
for
purposes
of
taking
the
parents
and
criticism
and
if
it
really
has
--
if
there's
really
much
left
of
it
so
far
as
the
child
is
concerned.
justice
abe
fortas
probably,
mr.
dorsen
there
agrees
what
is
a
public
crime
and
that
one
might
very
well
take
position
that
the
trial
so
to
speak
of
a
juvenile
in
the
judge's
chambers
with
nobody
there
but
the
juvenile
and
the
judge
would
be
a
constitutional
and
offensive
but
that
perhaps
a
trial
from
which
the
general
newspaper
reporters
and
general
public
were
excluded
might
not
be
constitutionally
offensive
and
somewhere
in
there,
isn't
that
possible?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
is
some
opinion
to
the
effect
that
even
on
the
case
of
adults
you
don't
have
a
television
camera
in
the
courtroom
and
make
it
a
public
trial,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
still
know
--
i'm
still
not
clear.
are
you
mr.
dorsen?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
and
the
determination
of
delinquency
as
i
understand
it
taken
the
account
not
only
a
specific
incident
had
issue
but
also
the
lawyer's
record?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
mr.
dorsen,
the
theory
is
that
there
are
specific
incidents
from
which
the
finding
of
delinquency
has
to
be
made
not
some
general
amorphous
reaction
to
the
boy.
but
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
one
immediate
incident
named
the
telephone
call.
there
was
this
reference
to
the
purse
taking
by
the
boy's
companion
at
which
gault
in
the
south
was
present
and
then
there
is
this
vague
reference
to
an
incident
involving
a
baseball
glove.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
it,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
illuminates
what
that
baseball
glove
incident
was
and
nothing
beyond
their
words
of
the
report
with
respect
to
the
first
taking.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
not
talking
about
at
least
a
constitutional
right.
justice
abe
fortas
at
least.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
hope
let's
assume
that
can
be
broken
down
a
little
bit.
will
it
interfere
with
individualized
treatment
in
the
arizona
conception
for
the
child
and
the
parent
to
be
given
a
written
notice?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
then
appears
with
the
individualized
treatment
for
the
counsel
to
be
provided
to
them.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
--
all
right,
i
will
just
like
to
get
less
from
here.
so
you
think
that
maybe
it
would
interfere
with
individualized
treatment
of
the
counsel
appointed
for
the
child.
justice
abe
fortas
as
far
as
the
child
were
told,
were
given
warnings
you
didn't
have
to
say
anything
and
if
they
did
say
anything
it
could
be
used
against
you.
do
you
think
that
will
interfere
with
individualized
treatment?
in
other
words,
if
he
is
given
an
opportunity
to
avoid
self-incrimination,
will
that
interfere
with
individualized
treatment?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
it
would?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
bad.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
appellate
review,
will
that
interfere
with
individualized
treatment?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
asking
that,
i
said
would
it
interfere
with
the,
what
you
say
is
arizona's
objective
which
is
individualized
treatment
providing
a
right
to
appeal
or
right
to
review.
would
that
interfere
with
the
individual?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
about
confrontation?
the
requirement
that
the
accusing
witness
testified
in
front
of
the
child
or
the
child's
counsel
or
child's
parent
or
all,
would
that
interfere
with
the
individualized
treatment?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
that
is
a
requirement?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
construe
this
record,
is
this
a
null
or
--
(voice
overlap)
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
yeah,
but
usually,
the
criminal
case
unless
there
is
a
clear
admission
case
proceeds
as
if
there
had
been
on
a
not
guilty
claim,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
it
in
your
view.
that
carried
one.
do
you
agree
that
confrontation
in
the
case
of
the
juvenile
is
a
constitutional
necessity
where
there
is
a
denial?
justice
abe
fortas
well
unless
you're
going
to
confess
here
than
you
have
to
take
the
position
that
the
gerald
gault
did
not
deny
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
act
of
which
your
complaint
was
made
here.
but
on
the
other
hand
he
didn't
admit
it,
did
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
get
back
to
the
other
point,
if
you
think
that
confrontation
where
the
boy
denies
guilt
would
not
negate
individualized
treatment,
why
is
it
that
you're
so
worried
about
self-incrimination
by
telling
the
boy
that
he
has
got
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
thought
you
said
that
was
alright
where
the
child
denies
guilt
that
you
thought
there
was
an
essential
element
of
fairness?
justice
abe
fortas
it
may
not
be
depending
on
how
one
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
they
know
they
would
establish
anything
by
declaring
convincing
evidence
sort
of
giving
--
providing
fundamental
due
process?
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
reading
was
sort
of
lesson
as
applied
to
juveniles
in
the
state
of
arizona.
justice
abe
fortas
extremely
low
means
what,
supplement
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
mean
40%,
50%?
justice
abe
fortas
why
did
the
state
in
its
capacity
as
parens
patriae
on
this
15-year-old
boy,
pick
him
up
and
put
him
in
the
receiving
home?
was
there
any
indication
that
he
was
about
to
plead
the
jurisdiction
or
would
not
be
available
for
trial?
was
the
warrant
obtained
as
the
record
show
what
information
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
this
supposedly
benevolent
parens
patriae,
the
state
picks
the
boy
up
and
puts
him
on
the
--
well
in
most
jurisdictions
one
would
have
to
say
is
whimsically
called
a
receiving
home.
i
don't
know
your
institute
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
congratulate
you
up
here
relatively
unique.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
routine,
isn't
it?
when
the
child
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
with
a
delinquency
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
it's
not?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
--
was
that
ever
approved
when
they
boy
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record?
was
there
anything
before
a
judge
saw
that
shows
that
that
was
proved?
that
the
boy
stole
the
baseball
glove?
is
there
anything
you
saw
with
the
circumstances
where
that
he
picked
it
up
on
the
baseball
field
and
he
break
into
the
store?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
then
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
even
the
judge
then
say
exactly
what
happened
in
this?
justice
abe
fortas
someone
--
well,
i
am
aware
of
knowing
that
that's
so
or
that
it's
not
so.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
based
on
what
you
say
and
what
happened
here
is
it
that
was
an
important
part,
it's
unwritten
and
unknown
perhaps
so
far
as
we
know,
unadmitted
and
unproved
incident
as
part
of
the
reason
for
putting
the
boy
in
detention
for
a
maximum
of
six
years
for
an
offense
which
he
have
committed
by
or
as
a
--
the
immediate
consequence
of
an
offense
which
is
committed
by
an
adult
would
have
resulted
in
the
maximum
of
two
months
imprisonment,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
forgive
me,
i'll
leave
you
alone
for
this.
but
so
far
as
this
record
shows
on
that
grand
theft
incident,
the
only
thing
that
we
have
is
a
scrap
of
paper
reproduced
in
this
record
that
shows
that
he
was
in
the
field
along
with
another
boy
and
that
the
other
boy
took
the
pocketbook,
is
my
recollection
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
all
we
know,
that
that
appears
on
this
sheet
of
paper.
we
don't
know
whether
the
boy
himself
was
culpable,
what
the
degree
of
culpability
was
when
he
participated
in
taking
it
or
whether
he
was
just
along
with
the
boy
and
now
the
representation
is
i
don't
--
maybe
it's
yours
but
basically
this
whole
theme,
it
has
said
that
the
state
as
i
think
is
parens
patriae,
the
exact
thing
as
sort
of
a
forced
father
of
this
boy.
and
one
of
the
things
that
it
takes
into
account
is
a
record
statement
that
the
boy
was
along
with
another
boy
in
the
movie
theater
and
the
other
boy
took
the
pocketbook.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
judge
didn't
say
it
in
fatherly
manner.
justice
abe
fortas
in
arizona
do
you
make
--
is
it
appropriate
or
permissible
to
make
a
finding
of
delinquency
on
the
basis
just
in
the
admissions
of
the
juvenile?
you
have
set
the
admissions
without
corroboration?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that's
what
this
case
stands
for?
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
a
rule
on
other
jurisdictions
is
entirely
in
effect
that
admissions
have
to
--
of
juveniles
have
to
be
corroborated
before
they
would
be
accepted
as
a
basis
for
--
justice
abe
fortas
with
what?
justice
abe
fortas
what
records
are
destroyed
though?
now,
here
is
a
case
where
a
boy
might
have
been
kept
in
custody
for
six
years.
and
you
certainly
don't
destroy
all
records
after
two
years.
what
is
destroyed
and
what
remains?
there
must
be
some
record
that
gerald
gault
was
subject
to
this
court
order
that
would
survive
for
the
six-year
period.
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
mean
now
that
this
would
be
destroyed
after
he
gets
to
be
21
with
gerald
gault
unless
he
gets
an
absolute
discharge
prior
to
that
time.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
you
construe
that
as
meaning
all
records
including
the
records
of
this
man
in
the
institution?
is
that
the
way?
justice
abe
fortas
just
that
with
the
proceeding.
but
the
fact
that
he
have
been
there
presumed
they
would
still
remain
on
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
told
compliment
in
terms
of
we've
been
talking
and
they
say
that
they
still
be
--
presumably
still
would
be
a
record
that
the
boy
was
sent
to
the
institution
for
such
and
such
a
period
for
such
and
such
on
such
and
such
a
basis.
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
green,
the
distinction
between
misdemeanors
and
felonies
is
based
on
some
difference
in
the
elements
of
the
act.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
the
distinction
between
delinquency
and
on
the
one
hand
felonies
and
misdemeanors
on
the
other
hand
may
or
may
not
be
based
on
the
difference
in
the
elements
of
the
act.
justice
abe
fortas
it
might
be
based
merely
on
the
fact
that
who
doesn't
whether
he's
18
years
old
or
19
years
old.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
difference
mr.
green,
here's
a
boy
and
let's
suppose
that
he
telephoned
this
lady
and
said
some
lewd
things
over
the
telephone.
he
was
picked
up
and
then
he
has
this,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
hearing
or
whatnot
and
the
end
of
it
is
that
he
is
to
send
away
for
maximum
of
six
years.
now,
if
an
adult
that
had
done
exactly
the
same
thin,
he
would
have
been
arrested.
he
would
have
been
tried.
he
would
have
been
given
due
process.
he
would
have
a
right
against
self-incrimination.
he
would
have
had
the
possibility
of
appeal.
there
would
have
been
transcript.
there
would
have
been
notice
in
writing.
the
burden
would
have
been
on
the
state
to
establish
his
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
there
would
have
been
confrontational
witnesses
all
because
he's
an
adult
and
the
most
he
could
have
been
put
away
for
is
two
months.
now,
here's
a
boy
that
gets
picked
up
and
he
gets
none
of
these
safeguards.
no
confrontational,
most
certainly
this
is
at
the
very
least
of
the
monthly
record
as
to
whether
he
admitted
his
--
that
he
did
it.
and
he
gets
sent
up
for
maximum
possibility
of
being
deprived
of
his
freedom
for
six
years
and
why
you
call
one
a
crime
and
not
the
other
one
a
crime?
justice
abe
fortas
but
one
--
one
of
the
questions
here
is
very
simply
put.
if
this
boy
was
sent
away
for
the
three
incidence
that
have
been
here
mentioned,
the
baseball
glove
incident,
and
whatever
that
was,
the
pocketbook
instance
whatever
that
was,
and
the
present
incident.
what
is
there
in
the
juvenile
court
fair
philosophy?
what
is
there
in
the
theory
of
the
juvenile
court
which
makes
it
undesirable
or
impossible
for
this
boy
to
have
had
the
basic
elements
of
a
trial
with
respect
to
those
incidents
so
that
at
least
he
would
have
known
and
we
would
know,
reviewing
courts
would
know
exactly
what
these
incidents
were,
what
happened,
why
this
boy
was
sent
away
for
six
years.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
doing
that
would
destroy
the
juvenile
court
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
green,
you
don't
say,
do
you,
that
due
process
is
what
the
juvenile
court
judge
says
it
is
in
the
particular
case
period
and
that's
the
end
of
the
definition.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
well
do
you
say
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
does
this
include
then?
i
mean
say,
if
you
say
it's
not
something
more
than
what
the
juvenile
court
judge
decides
in
this
particular
case,
would
it
include
a
notice
in
writing?
justice
abe
fortas
adequate
notice.
justice
abe
fortas
would
it
include
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
would
it
include
a
warning
about
the
--
and
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination,
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
get
any
words
by
trying
to
solve
these
problems
in
terms
of
the
use
of
the
word
like
‘crime’
or
‘not
crime’.
i
mean
the
question
is
we're
dealing
with
proceedings
here
in
which
the
persons
maybe
deprived
of
their
liberty
to
put
into
a
place
24
hours
a
day.
they're
in
custody
and
you
can
call
it
a
crime
or
you
can
call
it
(inaudible)
but
it
still
deprives
the
liberty.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
and
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
difference
between
a
man
and
a
woman.
mr.
green
let
me
just
ask
you
one
more
and
then
i'll
leave
you
alone.
how
about
confrontation?
would
you
consider
that
the
right
to
confrontation
is
part
of
due
process
for
juveniles?
