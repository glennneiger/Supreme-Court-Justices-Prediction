justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
damage
that
does
in
the
--
should
i
read
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
saying,
its
view
is
that
that
notice
constitutionally
as
required.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
issue
i
notice
here
is
only
as
to
the
adequacy,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
mean
the
issue
here
is
not,
there's
an
issue
before
us
where
the
constitution
is
required
or
only
on
the
adequacies
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although,
we
start
where
the
premise,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
agrees
that
it
noticed
that
constitutionally
is
required.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
independent
juvenile
court
in
arizona?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
this
one
mr.
dorsen.
i
noticed
one
of
the
brief
here
that
that
was
fundamentally
speaking
now
on
a
legal
concept.
basic
right
of
the
juvenile
is
not
the
liberty
that
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
reject
it
but
isn't
that
--
doesn't
that
sum
up
the
legal
concept
upon
which
some
of
these
rights
are
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
brief
suggested
many
of
it,
that
it
means
that
there
are
special
problems
of
the
child
class
interest
with
building
on
the
notion
that
the
basic
right
of
the
pupil
is
custody,
whether
he
is
a
juvenile
delinquent
or
not
the
children
of
all
of
these
is
supposed
to
be
in
custody
with
the
parents,
if
that's
the
notion
which
support
these
different
treatment,
is
that
supposed
to
be
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
but
isn't
that
the
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
you
don't
have
to
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
getting
back
to
this
(inaudible),
would
your
position
carry
those
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that
we
can
answer
some
of
the
questions
honestly
without
thinking
about
some
of
these
others.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
his
parents
knew
and
demand
a
public
trial
that
being
a
constitutional
argument
of
public
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
dorsen
did
you
think
of
it
as
a
constitutional
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now,
can
you
suggest
how
we
would
distinguish
in
terms
of
the
times
when
an
adult
is
entitled
under
the
case
that
requires
a
counsel
--
the
case
of
the
children?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dorsen,
well
you
couldn't
say
that
but
you
can't
limit
this
case
here,
that
this
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
--
well
it
reads
that
to
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
think
of
a
distinction
if
we
say
that
that
the
child
would
be
counseled
by
any
adult
who
would
be
playing
that
right
and
the
rights
of
public
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dorsen,
i
might
just
have
given
up
what
was
the
material
is,
it's
possibly
here,
or
this
were
not
to
miss
the
appellant
as
to
how
far
this
progression
within
the
states
either
by
statute
or
court
decisions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
least
we
have
state
briefly
how
extensive
this
would
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
will
that
mr.
dorsen
in
that
case,
in
that
particular
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
they
all
agree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
all
agree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
any
of
this
or
either
way?
either
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
some
members
of
that
association
think
that
none

should?
