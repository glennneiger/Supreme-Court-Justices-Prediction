to

justice

well,
how
about
the

neglected

are

there,
neglected

he
wasn't
charged
of
violating
that
statute,
was
he?
justice
potter

did
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
hold
that
or
didn't
hold
that
assuming
a
notice
is
required;
a
notice
was
given
to
you.
justice

so
that
would
seem
to
imply
that
the
court
thought
that
notice
was
a
part.

but
as
offspring,
it's
also
part
of

it's
a
quid

you
don't

i
suppose
at
common
law
you
could
take
an
8-year-old
boy
and
put
him
to
trial
before
a
jury
and
convict
him
and
sentence
him
to
be
hanged
and
give
him
all
--
do
all
the
constitutional
rights
of
trial
by
jury
and
the
cross-examination
and
the
rest
of
it.
they
decided
to
remove
that
in
the

of
the
criminal
courts
and
set
up
the
alternative
procedure.
justice

stewart
if
that
is
correct,
it
doesn't
make
that
quite
different
from
the
conventional
criminal
trial?
the
determination
of
delinquency
depends
not
on
specific
acts
of
misconduct
but
only
upon
those
in
reference
to
it,
the
totality
of
this
previous
record
does
not
that
make
this
whole

justice
potter
stewart
--
administration.
that's
entirely
different
burden
from
a
criminal
trial
where
it's
generally
considered
prejudicial
to
bring
in
anything
about
this
previous
conduct
except
the
specific
misconduct
of
which
he
is
charged.
justice
potter

and
how
about
notice
just
before
you
sit
down?
what
should
they
notice
according
to

just
in

they
noticed
about
the
charge
about
the
phone
call
or
what
else
if
there's
anything.

to
the

stewart
if
somebody
were
going
to
charge
against
me
they
don't
notify
my

do
they?

well,

what

it
quite

the
