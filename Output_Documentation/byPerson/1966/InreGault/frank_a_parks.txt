mr.
frank
a.
parks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
the
court
please.
the
attack
that
is
being
made
today
against
the
arizona
juvenile
code
goes
in
our
estimation
to
the
heart
of
the
american
juvenile
court
system.
we,
the
appellees
in
this
case,
consider
this
the
crossroad
of
juvenile
jurisprudence
for
approximately
two-thirds
of
the
sanctuary
in
a
vast
majority
of
cases,
juvenile
codes
very,
very
similar,
if
not
exactly
the
same
as
the
arizona
code
have
weathered
constitutional
attacks.
and
i
think
at
the
outset
with
considerable
justification
even
opposing
counsel
as
a
critic
to
the
arizona
code
will
admit
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
a
jurisdiction
to
treat
their
children
differently
than
they
would
an
adult.
an
adult
defender
of
that
would
be
the
proper
phraseology.
the
conflict
of
course
arises
entirely
with
on
the
one
hand
what
is
required
by
due
process,
fair
treatment
and
the
sociologist
concept
of
what
is
proper
treatment
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
a
child,
the
individual
of
tender
years.
well,
at
the
outset
in
proffering
the
calls
for
the
state
of
arizona,
i
think
it's
our
court
that
has
explicitly
stated,
they
are
interested
entirely
in
the
individualized
justice
approach
to
children's
problems.
this
is
their
main
aim
in
regard
to
handling
the
problems
of
youth.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
in
regard
to
my
estimation
of
new
york
provisions,
your
honor
i
believe,
that
new
york
has
gone
beyond
their
crossroad.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no
crossroad
for
them
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
california.
they
have
made
an
inroad
on
their
crossroad
i
believe
while
they
haven't
--
while
they
haven't
gone
as
far
as
the
potential
constitutional
ramifications
could
conceivably
take
it
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
judging
me
short,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
certain
states
and
of
course
i
look
through
with
a
monocle
as
seen
through
the
state
of
arizona
as
to
what
our
conception
is
of
a
proper
and
a
proper
functioning
juvenile
system.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
certainly
will.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
mr.
justice
white,
i
certainly
will.
the
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
certainly
not.
certainly
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well
this,
if
you
would
wish,
i
will
go
into
it
now.
i
had
hope
that
i
might
just
give
you
the
basic
foundation
for
our
reasoning
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
definitely,
your
honor.
definitely.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct.
the
warning
of
a
right
against
self-incrimination,
give
that
warning
in
every
case.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
if
the
legislature
so
deemed
that
as
the
law
of
our
jurisdiction
then
so
be
it.
i
take
the
position
that
the
failure
of
our
legislature
to
define
an
absolute
channel
of
review
did
not
deny
due
process.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
good
conscience,
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
cases
where
the
charges
are
denied
by
the
child
i
think
it
is
a
requirement
of
due
process.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
wouldn't
say
side-step
the
issue.
they
took
it
front
on
by
deciding
that
in
this
specific
instance,
it
was
not
a
relevant
argument.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
as
i
will
intend
to
interpret
the
facts
of
the
case
that
i
think
they
are
a
bit
distorted
by
appellants
as
the
actual
permissions
that
were
made.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
i
think
it
--
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
it's
a
constitutional
requirement
but
i
would
be
the
first
one
to
accept
the
concept
that
fair
treatment
would
warrant
a
rule
that
would
decide
if
the
child
has
denied
the
charges
that
there'll
be
a
fact-finding
procedure
to
determine
whether
in
fact
the
facts
which
have
been
alleged
are
correct
or
incorrect.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
as
i
would
show
the
court
in
the
record,
there
were
specific
references
made
to
the
statements
made
by
the
boy
not
only
to
the
judge
who
on
two
different
occasions
that
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
specifically
stated,
“i
talked
to
the
boy
and
asked
him
if
in
fact
this
telephone
call
was
made.”
the
boy
gave
the
exact
set
of
facts
as
it's
related
in
the
record
that
he
had
dialed
the
number
and
he
had
stated
some
of
the
words
although
not
the
most
serious
of
those
words.
this
was
also
substantiated
by
deputy
probation
officer
flagg
who
also
testified
at
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
the
boy
on
two
different
occasions
admitted
to
him
that
he
had
stated
the
words
involved.
mr.
dorsen
had
relied
on
the
next
perhaps
out
of
the
record
where
at
the
second
hearing
on
the
15th,
they
again
went
back
into
talking
to
the
boy
to
try
to
find
out
the
specific
facts
that
the
judge
wanted
to
delve
into
it
that
time.
and
then
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
i
think
the
one
potential
disadvantage
to
confrontation
is
to
bring
the
child
into
the
center
of
an
adversary
proceeding
with
all
the
taint
perhaps
of
a
criminal
proceeding
that
we
try
to
remove
in
the
child.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
of
course
i'm
going
outside
the
record
now,
your
honor,
as
far
as
my
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
because
it's
my
position
that
i
think
fundamental
fairness
requires
a
fair
fact-finding
determination
of
an
adjudication
of
delinquency.
and
if
the
child
denies
it,
i
think
that
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
discretionary
powers
of
the
judge
to
ensure
that
the
subject
is
aired
to
that
degree
which
to
his
satisfaction
and
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
will
indicate
that
there
has
been
a
violation
if
there
is
a
violation
or
that
the
facts
alleged
indeed
did
take
place.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
i
think
the
two
would
run
hand-in-hand,
your
honor.
of
course,
if
i
just
may
answer
the
one
remaining
question
left
unanswered,
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
the
privilege
against
self-incriminations
to
warn
the
child
of
that.
well,
this
gets
right
to
the
basic
core
of
the
juvenile
system
that
everything
has
conceivably
done
is
for
the
purpose
of
enhancing
the
welfare
of
the
child
which
the
state's
last
opportunity
to
take
the
child
of
tender
years
in
a
very,
very
supreme
effort
try
to
take
that
child
which
perhaps
is
encourageable
and
make
him
a
good
citizen.
now,
to
tell
him
at
the
outset,
we're
here
for
your
benefit,
anything
you
say
may
be
used
against
you.
you
don't
have
to
say
anything.
i
think
that
even
the
experts
in
the
field
will
indicate
that
this
is
a
very,
very
bad
first
step.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
the
report
that
comes
out
on
a
county
basis
on
our
state
indicates
that
it
was
below
the
national
level.
i
don't
have
the
specific
figures
before
us.
the
report
comes
out
of
our
fort
grant
industrial
school
which
is
entirely
for
delinquent
children.
they
indicate
that
their
number
of
repeaters
is
extremely
low.
and
that's
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
ones
who
where
in
their
once
normally
then
come
back.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
i
think
they're
very
--
in
‘54
--
'64,
i
believe
it
was
in
the
20%
bracket.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
have
the
court
respectfully
bear
in
mind
that
when
the
state
acts
as
the
parens
patriae
in
place
of
the
parent,
it
does
in
fact
do
that.
now,
i
would
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
just
bear
in
mind
that
we're
dealing
here
with
the
child.
now,
this
is
a
completely
different,
if
i
may
start
with
my
argument
from
this
basis,
a
completely
different
individual
that
than
an
adult.
all
through
a
child's
adolescent
years,
he
goes
through
period
of
limited
freedom.
he
doesn't
know
absolute
liberty
and
freedom
as
such
is
known
to
an
adult.
i
mean,
he
has
no
absolute
right
to
go
out
and
drive
a
car,
he
has
a
limited
right
to
contract.
he
doesn't
have
personal
liberty
to
avoid
compulsory
education.
his
entire
adolescent
years
in
many
cases
a
direct
indication
of
just
how
he
is
going
to
be
brought
up
is
directly
dependent
on
what
proper
parental
restraints
are
placed
upon
him.
if
a
child
needs
necessary
restraints
the
parent
gives
it
to
him.
and
i
think
this
was
the
basic
feature
behind
the
first
juvenile
court.
the
state
steps
in
and
tries
its
very
best
when
the
parent
is
not
doing
the
job
to
do
that
job
in
the
parent's
place.
now,
the
facts
this
case
will
bear
a
--
or
lend
a
great
degree
of
credence
to
the
statements
that
i'm
making
here
today.
this
is
not
--
was
not
a
waiver
proceeding
in
our
estimation
based
on
the
record.
we
don't
think
it
was
a
case
of
which
a
child
denied
to
tell
the
judge
all
and
i
think
his
statements
indicated
that
he
had
stated
some
of
the
lewd
remarks
that
were
made
on
the
phone.
the
facts
as
stated
by
mr.
dorsen
were
basically
correct.
however,
he
made
one
statement
that
i
had
previously
just
touched
upon
that
at
june
there
were
two
hearings.
the
boy
was
picked
up
directly
on
the
eighth.
he
was
placed
in
a
detention
home
in
this
very,
very
small
community
in
arizona,
globe,
arizona.
and
the
probation
officer
who
was
directly
involved
in
this
case,
probation
officer
flagg,
stated
that
he
did
not
come
back
to
the
probation
center
as
part
of
his
activities
until
late
around
in
the
afternoon
of
the
eighth.
he
immediately
went
down
to
the
detention
home
and
this
was
i
believe
in
the
early
hours
of
the
evening.
concurrently,
therewith,
mrs.
gault
came
home
and
found
out
her
son
had
been
picked
up
by
the
police
and
he
was
down
to
the
detention
center.
they
met
at
that
time.
now,
this
was
a
day
before
the
hearing.
flagg
who
was
one
of
two
probation
officers
on
the
staff
of
the
juvenile
court
in
that
county
spoke
to
mrs.
gault
and
his
statement
as
i
have
related
my
brief
is
to
the
effect
that
he
talked
to
mrs.
gault,
he
explained
everything
to
her.
mrs.
gault
also
admitted
that
this
conversation
took
place.
she
admitted
that
when
she
talked
to
probation
officer
flagg,
he
said,
“i
am
going
to
try
to
set
the
hearing
up
for
3
pm
tomorrow.”
now,
on
june
9th,
this
first
hearing
took
place
as
related
by
mr.
dorsen.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
warrant
obtained
but
i
think
the
record
while
it
is
not
specifically
passed
on
this
issue
will
show
that
on
that
specific
date,
the
father
was
away
on
his
job
some
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
up
in
the
grand
canyon
area.
his
mother
was
working.
the
boy
was
home
alone.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
we
would
like
to
think
of
that
as
a
detention
centers
is
getting
the
center
of
our
attention,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
but
the
juvenile
officer
who
by
law
is
required
to
be
contacted
immediately
in
his
best
discretion
decided
that
the
proper
procedure
in
this
case
was
to
have
the
boy
taken
to
the
detention
center.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
not
all
cases
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
not
in
all
cases.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
not
in
all
cases.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
mr.
chief
justice,
this
did
not
take
place.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
this
did
not
take
place.
there
was
no
written
notice
left
at
the
home.
we
as
appellees
in
this
case
tried
to
justify
it
to
the
respect
that
flagg
who
was
out
during
the
day
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
detention
center
happened
to
meet
mrs.
gault
and
we
would
presume
that
if
he
had
been
there
earlier
there
would
have
been
an
actual
notice.
he
testified
he
talked
to
her,
specifically
informed
her
about
what
the
complaint
contained
and
he
also
specifically
told
her
where
when
the
hearing
was
to
take
place.
no
subsequent
written
notes.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
they
did
not.
they
did
not.
the
very,
very
important
factor
i
think
that
goes
to
the
entire
panoramic
view
of
this
case
is
that
the
boy
was
not
new
nor
was
his
parents,
completely
new
to
this
type
of
state
action.
the
boy
had
his
first
scrape
with
the
law
back
in
1962
when
as
the
counsel
has
stated
there
was
a
theft
to
the
baseball
glove.
now,
this
was
disposed
of
through
the
probation
office
intake
procedure.
there
was
no
formal
complaint
made,
but
with
a
small
type
of
an
office
that
i
know
that
they
have
in
gila
county.
this
was
a
thing
that
was
a
common
knowledge
to
them.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
other
than
there
was
no
written
record
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
it's
just
that
--
where
in
this
case
as
a
factual
matter,
the
judge
was
there
back
in
1962,
these
probation
officers
were
there
in
‘62
and
they
handled
it.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
he
was
not
asked
to
delve
into
that
specific
issue,
his
statements
on
the
fact
show
he
was
well
aware
of
what
the
facts
of
the
case
were.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that's
correct.
well,
the
judge
indicated
that
--
judge
mcghee
that
this
was
not
the
entire
criteria
involved.
the
boy
was
still
on
probation
from
the
february
2nd,
1964
adjudication
of
delinquency
when
he
was
involved
with
that
grand
theft.
and
being
on
probation,
i
think
the
court
went
through
their
adjudicatory
proceeding
determined
whether
or
not
the
facts
as
alleged
on
this
occasion
took
place
and
they
took
into
effect
the
fact
that
the
boy
was
already
on
probation.
he
was
not
responding
to
their
therapeutic
approach
that
the
court
was
trying
to
afford
him.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
was
the
basic
substance
of
that
prior
probation
and
i
know
the
court
is
limited
to
in
this
case
the
order
signed
by
the
court
under
that
occasion.
they
determined
the
boy
could
be
delinquent
and
just
what
the
provisions
of
his
probationary
period
were.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
the
basic
framework,
your
honor,
i
would
say,
was
complied
with.
we
think
it
was
as
far
as
a
notice
is
concerned,
as
far
as
going
through
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
as
we
think
it
should
be
you
held.
the
fact
that
the
parents
were
given
notice
of
the
hearing,
our
court
said
that
if
the
boy
had
in
their
estimation
denied
the
charges,
they
would
have
definitely
had
a
reasonable
period
of
time
in
which
to
prepare
a
defense.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
i
understand.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
that
is
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
the
arizona
court
based
its
decision
with
the
fact
that
they
were
going
along
with
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
have
held
similarly
on
similar
points
they
did
not
go
into
the
extreme
citation
stage
that
they
could
have.
i
mean
the
case
law
up
until
now
is
relatively
replete
with
cases
that
have
passed
on
the
same
identical
subjects
where
the
courts
had
accepted
the
parens
patriae
doctrine.
they
have
said
that
we
recognize
the
child
is
entitled
to
due
process
or
the
question
is
what
does
due
process
require
in
this
special
tribunal
and
they
have
balanced
on
the
one
hand
as
i
have
mentioned
the
needs
of
the
individual
and
on
the
other
hand
adjust
what
the
goals
of
the
quality
are
in
recognizing
the
type
of
individual
being
dealt
with.
they
have
confronted
the
question
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
i
--
of
course,
i
speak
through
the
mouth
now
of
our
supreme
court
who
interpreted
our
statute
by
saying
the
constitutional
--
not
the
constitutional
but
the
requirements
of
fair
play
and
due
process
require
notice.
and
i
cannot
be
absolutely
sure
but
well
i
know
in
cases
gone
by,
cases
decided
that
there
was
no
right
to
notice
state
act
with
this
parens
patriae.
it
could
do
that
as
it
would
without
notice.
we
here
are
saying
that
that
is
required
and
that
these
are
one
of
the
injections
into
our
juvenile
code
that
i
think
will
take
away
from
the
immediate
splash
made
by
mr.
dorsen
that
our
juvenile
code
is
briefed
of
any
protection
whatsoever.
what
we're
trying
to
equalize
what
is
needed
and
what
is
required.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
if
one
was
to
accept
the
principle
that
a
child
has
the
same
absolute
rights
as
a
parent,
then
one
would
only
have
one
hurdle
remaining.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
regards
to
taking
the
juvenile
and
sending
him
to
the
state?
mr.
frank
a.
parks
we
tend
to
think
it's
not
confinement
merely
because
his
liberty,
he
is
limited
to
the
parental
restraint
levels.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
we
look
at
it
from
this
point.
it
is
very
difficult
and
i
think
it
would
be
naïve
to
argue
that
when
the
child
goes
to
an
industrial
school
he
has
the
right
to
walk
out
the
gate
any
time
he
wants
to.
this
is
not
true.
the
child
is
sent
there
for
training.
it's
just
like
saying
if
you're
going
to
be
sent
to
school
you're
going
to
school
from
eight
until
four
or
whatever
the
hours
are
and
you
may
leave
at
4
o'clock
and
come
home.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
he
is
there
on
a
24-hour
basis
depending
on
what
the
provisions
are
for
perhaps
his
temporary
release.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
if
one
would
consider
it
a
penal
institution.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
the
record
shows
the
father
was
constantly
away.
there
were
statements
made
by
judge
mcghee
to
the
effect
that
after
having
made
an
investigation
they
didn't
think
that
the
parents
were
performing
the
function
they
should.
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
perhaps
one
of
the
items
involved
is
just
what
function
the
parents
have
claimed.
and
if
you
got
a
good
child
who's
not
being
helped
by
his
parents
as
he
should,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
child,
your
honor,
to
attempt
to
keep
him
on
the
straight
road
of
life
until
he
gets
to
the
age
of
21
when
he's
on
his
own.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
this
is
a
prerogative
of
the
juvenile
court
as
far
as
sending
them
home
if
they
wish.
the
court
here
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
yes,
sir.
he
has
the
option
of
taking
the
child
away
from
the
parents
and
putting
him
in
a
training
school
or
it
is
merely
an
act
of
delinquency
which
has
no
correlation
to
the
family
life
that
the
juvenile
judge
has
the
ability
to
say
the
boy
is
going
home,
stay
at
home,
and
you'll
have
a
curfew,
he'll
go
to
group
sessions.
he
will
have
these
requirements
placed
upon
him.
it
depends
on
each
individual
situation.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
and
this
leads
me
to
a
point
that
has
not
been
brought
out
and
i
think
that
they
track
a
bit
from
the
harshness
of
the
disposition
that
was
made
by
the
juvenile
judge.
gerald
gault
is
no
longer
in
fort
grant
state
industrial
school.
and
i
bring
up
these
factors
for
two
reasons
it
perhaps
would
have
rendered
this
case
moot.
but
under
our
arizona
law,
when
a
child
is
sent
to
the
industrial
school,
he
is
under
the
exclusive
control
of
the
state
board
of
directors
of
institutions
for
juveniles.
he
is
under
their
exclusive
control
on
jurisdiction
until
he
reaches
his
majority
or
he
is
absolutely
released.
now,
in
this
case,
one
of
the
ramifications
of
the
individualized
treatment
shows
that
on
december
9th
of
1964,
in
other
words
about
five
months
after
he
was
committed,
the
boy
was
replaced
in
his
home
under
what
is
commonly
called
our
home
placement
program.
and
it's
a
conditional
release
where
under
many,
many
circumstances
the
boy
is
allowed
to
go
home
for
a
weekend.
and
then
he
is
taken
back
to
the
institution
for
training,
for
development,
for
guidance
during
the
week
and
allowed
to
go
home.
he
is
presently
at
our
latest
report
still
with
his
parents
and
as
a
result
of
the
adjudication
here
he
spent
only
five
months
in
our
industrial
school.
they
applied
what
they
thought
was
needed
on
the
boy
and
now
he
hasn't
been
in
trouble
since
december
9th
of
1964.
now,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
this
renders
this
moot.
in
others
words,
it
was
raised
before
it
came
here.
we
thought
not
for
the
basic
reason
that
the
boy
did
not
have
his
absolute
release.
he
was
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
our
board
of
directors
anytime
he
could
be
taken
back
without
a
hearing,
etcetera.
i
think
my
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
it
is
our
position
mr.
chief
justice
that
whether
or
not
a
complaining
party
should
be
there
is
directly
dependent
and
commingled
the
question
of
whether
or
not
when
in
a
fatherly
manner
the
juvenile
judge
says,
“gerald,
what
went
on?
what
did
you
do?”
and
the
boy
says,
“well,
judge,
i
called
the
number
and
i
said
some
of
the
words
on
the
phone.”
mr.
frank
a.
parks
and
i'd
say
it
wasn't
an
arizona
juvenile
judge,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
our
supreme
court
reviewing
the
entire
record
thought
that
the
statements
that
were
made
and
there
was
one
person
who
held
a
view
that
gerald
did
not
make
the
admission.
that
was
mrs.
gault,
she
was
the
one
who
was
at
the
june
9th
adjudicatory
hearing.
the
father
wasn't
there.
at
that
hearing,
there
were
statements
made
as
to
could
you
hear
what
was
stated?
did
you
know
what
was
going
on?
and
through
her
testimony
on
occasion
she
says,
i
think
they
said
this
i
think
they
said
that.
now
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor
in
regard
to
the
second
hearing
on
june
15th.
now,
this
would
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
sir.
that
on
june
9th
was
the
first
hearing
and
that
statement
which
was
made
by
probation
officer
flagg
and
judge
mcghee
is
that
at
the
june
9th
hearing
gerald
admitted
making
some
of
the
statements.
flagg
testified
that
at
the
june
15th
hearing
the
boy
recanted
and
said
that
he
didn't.
then
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
judge
and
the
probation
officer
because
the
judge
said
that
the
boy
told
him
again
on
the
15th
that
he
had
made
some
of
the
statements.
and
i
can
just
state
that
our
supreme
court
selected
the
facts
and
decided
that
the
boy
had
in
fact
made
the
admissions
that
were
contended
on
our
behalf
during
the
appeal
and
that
there
was
no
need
to
go
into
the
confrontation
issue
because
there
were
in
fact
admissions
and
now
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
was
a
case
of
first
instance
in
that
regard
in
arizona
on
this
issue
and
they
are
directly
saying
that
the
boy
admits
that
there
is
no
relevant
issue
on
that
subject
and
they
have
disposed
of
it.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
i
know
that
deals
with
cases
of
where
i
believe
there's
a
question
of
who
is
an
accomplice
and
who
is
a
--
if
there
is
a
violation
involved
if
they
are
an
accomplice
i
don't
know
of
any
specific
cases
where
any
statement
by
a
juvenile
has
to
be
corroborated
before
it's
acceptable
for
it's
probative
value.
i
would
like
to
just
move
on
to
i
think
probably
one
of
the
most
important
areas
and
that
is
the
right
to
counsel.
i
have
relinquished
certain
portion
of
my
time
to
and
mr.
merritt
green
presenting
the
ohio
association
of
juvenile
court
judges
who
would
like
to
make
some
statements
on
the
case
at
hand.
the
positions
being
taken
by
appellants
in
regard
to
the
right
of
counsel
are
based
entirely
upon
what
they
consider
and
believed
to
be
the
requirements
of
due
process.
in
doing
so,
they
are
definitely
and
entirely
acquitting
the
juvenile
proceeding
to
a
criminal
trial.
we
contend
that
this
is
not
so.
our
statute
specifically
holds;
it
is
not
to
be
considered
a
juvenile
or
a
criminal
trial,
a
child
is
not
convicted
if
he
is
found
delinquent.
his
statements
can
in
no
way
be
considered
a
conviction
of
a
crime.
our
state
has
gone
perhaps
one
step
farther
by
trying
to
protect
the
child
as
much
as
possible
by
requiring
that
two
years
after
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
the
records
will
be
destroyed.
our
legislature
saw
this
as
a
means
of
avoiding
the
problems
of
when
the
boy
gets
to
the
20
and
21
where
he
has
the
record
available
for
perhaps
civil
service
or
the
fbi
to
see,
that
is
destroyed.
we
have
specific
provisions
for
the
destruction
of
those
records.
we
like
to
think
that
this
is
a
means
of
taking
this
proceeding
and
if
it
has
performed
its
function
of
taking
it
and
dispensing
with
it.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
and
therefore,
dispensing
with
any
potential
problems
that
could
arise
out
of
that
hearing
beyond
what
was
contemplated
by
our
statute.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
your
honor,
title
8
section
238
in
our
juvenile
code
provides
for
the
destruction
of
records
after
two
years
after
the
discharge
of
the
child
from
the
institutions
in
which
he
may
have
been
committed.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
they
make
a
specific
mention
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
destroys
the
records
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
of
course,
i
couldn't
make
a
specific
statement
that
in
all
cases
the
proceedings
are
destroyed
and
the
background
information
is
retained.
i
should
imagine
that
in
some
cases
there
is
a
variance
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
think
by
the
requirements
of
statute
it's
only
required
that
they
destroy
a
record
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
there's
a
possibility
that
that
is
true.
as
to
the
right
to
counsel,
i
necessarily
find
myself
arguing
a
philosophical
point
of
view
which
is
the
basic
foundation
of
our
juvenile
system.
we
don't
think
the
word
liberty
is
used
in
the
same
sense
that
that
word
is
used
in
our
constitutional
provisions.
we
think
that
of
course
there's
a
clear
cleavage
between
our
position
and
appellants
that
we
think
the
probation
officer
can
serve
a
function
for
the
child
which
either
remove
as
much
of
a
traumatic
experience
for
the
child
as
possible,
probation
officer
acts
for
the
child.
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
probation
officer
be
present
during
the
hearings
and
represent
the
interest
of
the
child.
of
course
the
appellants
take
the
position
that
this
is
not
possible.
i
argue
not
in
the
same
vein
as
one
would
have
perhaps
argued
the
miranda
decision
that
we
don't
need
this
type
of
procedure
because
it's
not
required.
there's
an
added
factor
here.
there
is
a
reason
why
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
at
this
proceeding
shouldn't
be
a
rule
absolute.
our
court
definitely
left
the
discretion
of
the
appointment
of
counsel
up
to
juvenile
judge
and
i
can
say
with
a
great
degree
of
frankness,
there
are
many,
many
proceedings
in
the
state
of
arizona
where
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
judge
is
used
to
say
in
this
case
we
think
counsel
is
required
and
therefore
it
shall
be.
this
is
a
case
where
the
judge
did
not
use
that
specific
discretion.
we
think
a
rule
absolute
would
require
or
would
destroy
the
flexibility
of
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
court
--
supreme
court
decided
back
and
i
believe
in
the
early
1950s
that
if
the
parents
wish
to
retain
counsel,
they
have
that
right
to
retain
counsel
of
their
own
choosing.
and
counsel
cannot
be
prohibited
from
performing
whatever
function
they
see
fit
at
that
hearing.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
there
--
there
is
a
distinction
mr.
chief
justice
between
what
the
court
perhaps
would
think
is
the
best
procedure
for
the
child.
they
might
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
just
came
in
here
to
encourage
the
boy
to
talk
as
the
first
means
of
rehabilitation.
it
would
work
better
without
counsel
to
perhaps
just
tidy
that
process
but
we
can't
go
so
far
as
to
say
because
we
think
that
specific
procedure
is
correct
we're
going
to
say
you
cannot
have
the
right
to
counsel
appointed
on
your
behalf.
in
other
words,
if
the
parent
so
wishes
we
didn't
think,
our
supreme
court
did
not
think
that
we
had
the
power
to
say,
“no,
you
are
going
to
be
prevented
from
doing
that.”
this
was
the
concept
of
fair
play.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
shall
have
counsel
in
the
circumstances
needed
and
that
the
circumstances
in
the
case
might
perhaps
warn
them,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
--
as
far
as
the
general
subject
on
counsel,
philosophically
it
is
our
position
that
the
spirit
of
law
rather
than
the
absolute
letter
constitutional
constructions
which
i
agree
individuals
can
go
and
pick
out
certain
statements
made
in
constitutional
questions
and
justify
their
position.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
in
balancing
the
needs
of
the
individual
and
the
goal
of
equality
that
the
spirit
of
the
law
rather
than
the
absolute
letter
of
the
law
would
require
this
court
to
accept
the
juvenile
proceeding
the
way
it
has
been
functioning
and
the
way
it
will
function
in
the
future.
i
guess
i'll
make
my
final
statement
on
the
right
against
self-incrimination
just
to
give
the
court
some
of
the
reasons
that
individuals
who
have
commented
on
the
subject
have
stated
there
is
a
reason
why
the
child
should
not
be
informed
of
that
right.
our
court
specifically
did
not
say
the
child
doesn't
have
the
right
only
that
the
court
did
not
have
to
advise
in
that
right.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
there's
no
criminal
conviction
involved,
number
one.
number
two,
a
refusal
for
the
child
to
testify
or
to
talk
to
the
judge
cannot
be
punished
if
in
many
cases
just
indicates
the
fact
that
the
child
is
antagonist
from
the
society
unwilling
to
cooperate
showing
a
further
need
for
perhaps
additional
guidance.
there's
no
prosecutor
present.
there
is
no
individual
twist
what
the
child
says.
we
would
prefer
to
think
of
our
juvenile
judges
as
talking
with
the
child
in
the
most
reasonable
perspective
encouraging
him
to
tell
the
truth.
as
far
as
the
right
to
appeal
and
the
right
to
a
transcript
i
would
just
rest
on
the
statements
made
in
my
brief
and
to
the
effect
that
we
think
the
decisions
on
the
subject
at
the
present
time
indicate
this
is
not
a
denial
of
due
process.
i'm
now
relinquished
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
mr.
green.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
i
know
as
mr.
dorsen
stated
many
of
the
states
are
varying
now.
i
know
there
are
five
that
require
appointment
of
counsel
after
request
and
to
finding
it.
in
arizona
it
is
left
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
judge.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
decision
of
our
arizona
supreme
court.
now,
the
point
of
counsel,
your
honor,
we
got
to
--
then
the
decision
is
left
to
the
juvenile
judge
that
he
thinks
it
is
required.
and
i
would
say
that
in
our
most
populous
county
or
state,
this
is
a
procedure
that
is
given
entirely
if
the
parents
ask
for
counsel.
the
court
bends
over
backwards
to
give
it
if
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
they
think
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
require
that.
it's
up
to
the
judge,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
the
court
please.
the
attack
that
is
being
made
today
against
the
arizona
juvenile
code
goes
in
our
estimation
to
the
heart
of
the
american
juvenile
court
system.
we,
the
appellees
in
this
case,
consider
this
the
crossroad
of
juvenile
jurisprudence
for
approximately
two-thirds
of
the
sanctuary
in
a
vast
majority
of
cases,
juvenile
codes
very,
very
similar,
if
not
exactly
the
same
as
the
arizona
code
have
weathered
constitutional
attacks.
and
i
think
at
the
outset
with
considerable
justification
even
opposing
counsel
as
a
critic
to
the
arizona
code
will
admit
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
a
jurisdiction
to
treat
their
children
differently
than
they
would
an
adult.
an
adult
defender
of
that
would
be
the
proper
phraseology.
the
conflict
of
course
arises
entirely
with
on
the
one
hand
what
is
required
by
due
process,
fair
treatment
and
the
sociologist
concept
of
what
is
proper
treatment
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
a
child,
the
individual
of
tender
years.
well,
at
the
outset
in
proffering
the
calls
for
the
state
of
arizona,
i
think
it's
our
court
that
has
explicitly
stated,
they
are
interested
entirely
in
the
individualized
justice
approach
to
children's
problems.
this
is
their
main
aim
in
regard
to
handling
the
problems
of
youth.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
in
regard
to
my
estimation
of
new
york
provisions,
your
honor
i
believe,
that
new
york
has
gone
beyond
their
crossroad.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no
crossroad
for
them
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
california.
they
have
made
an
inroad
on
their
crossroad
i
believe
while
they
haven't
--
while
they
haven't
gone
as
far
as
the
potential
constitutional
ramifications
could
conceivably
take
it
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
judging
me
short,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
certain
states
and
of
course
i
look
through
with
a
monocle
as
seen
through
the
state
of
arizona
as
to
what
our
conception
is
of
a
proper
and
a
proper
functioning
juvenile
system.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
certainly
will.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
mr.
justice
white,
i
certainly
will.
the
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
certainly
not.
certainly
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well
this,
if
you
would
wish,
i
will
go
into
it
now.
i
had
hope
that
i
might
just
give
you
the
basic
foundation
for
our
reasoning
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
definitely,
your
honor.
definitely.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct.
the
warning
of
a
right
against
self-incrimination,
give
that
warning
in
every
case.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
if
the
legislature
so
deemed
that
as
the
law
of
our
jurisdiction
then
so
be
it.
i
take
the
position
that
the
failure
of
our
legislature
to
define
an
absolute
channel
of
review
did
not
deny
due
process.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
good
conscience,
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
cases
where
the
charges
are
denied
by
the
child
i
think
it
is
a
requirement
of
due
process.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
wouldn't
say
side-step
the
issue.
they
took
it
front
on
by
deciding
that
in
this
specific
instance,
it
was
not
a
relevant
argument.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
as
i
will
intend
to
interpret
the
facts
of
the
case
that
i
think
they
are
a
bit
distorted
by
appellants
as
the
actual
permissions
that
were
made.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
i
think
it
--
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
it's
a
constitutional
requirement
but
i
would
be
the
first
one
to
accept
the
concept
that
fair
treatment
would
warrant
a
rule
that
would
decide
if
the
child
has
denied
the
charges
that
there'll
be
a
fact-finding
procedure
to
determine
whether
in
fact
the
facts
which
have
been
alleged
are
correct
or
incorrect.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
as
i
would
show
the
court
in
the
record,
there
were
specific
references
made
to
the
statements
made
by
the
boy
not
only
to
the
judge
who
on
two
different
occasions
that
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
specifically
stated,
“i
talked
to
the
boy
and
asked
him
if
in
fact
this
telephone
call
was
made.”
the
boy
gave
the
exact
set
of
facts
as
it's
related
in
the
record
that
he
had
dialed
the
number
and
he
had
stated
some
of
the
words
although
not
the
most
serious
of
those
words.
this
was
also
substantiated
by
deputy
probation
officer
flagg
who
also
testified
at
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
the
boy
on
two
different
occasions
admitted
to
him
that
he
had
stated
the
words
involved.
mr.
dorsen
had
relied
on
the
next
perhaps
out
of
the
record
where
at
the
second
hearing
on
the
15th,
they
again
went
back
into
talking
to
the
boy
to
try
to
find
out
the
specific
facts
that
the
judge
wanted
to
delve
into
it
that
time.
and
then
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
i
think
the
one
potential
disadvantage
to
confrontation
is
to
bring
the
child
into
the
center
of
an
adversary
proceeding
with
all
the
taint
perhaps
of
a
criminal
proceeding
that
we
try
to
remove
in
the
child.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
of
course
i'm
going
outside
the
record
now,
your
honor,
as
far
as
my
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
because
it's
my
position
that
i
think
fundamental
fairness
requires
a
fair
fact-finding
determination
of
an
adjudication
of
delinquency.
and
if
the
child
denies
it,
i
think
that
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
discretionary
powers
of
the
judge
to
ensure
that
the
subject
is
aired
to
that
degree
which
to
his
satisfaction
and
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
will
indicate
that
there
has
been
a
violation
if
there
is
a
violation
or
that
the
facts
alleged
indeed
did
take
place.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
i
think
the
two
would
run
hand-in-hand,
your
honor.
of
course,
if
i
just
may
answer
the
one
remaining
question
left
unanswered,
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
the
privilege
against
self-incriminations
to
warn
the
child
of
that.
well,
this
gets
right
to
the
basic
core
of
the
juvenile
system
that
everything
has
conceivably
done
is
for
the
purpose
of
enhancing
the
welfare
of
the
child
which
the
state's
last
opportunity
to
take
the
child
of
tender
years
in
a
very,
very
supreme
effort
try
to
take
that
child
which
perhaps
is
encourageable
and
make
him
a
good
citizen.
now,
to
tell
him
at
the
outset,
we're
here
for
your
benefit,
anything
you
say
may
be
used
against
you.
you
don't
have
to
say
anything.
i
think
that
even
the
experts
in
the
field
will
indicate
that
this
is
a
very,
very
bad
first
step.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
the
report
that
comes
out
on
a
county
basis
on
our
state
indicates
that
it
was
below
the
national
level.
i
don't
have
the
specific
figures
before
us.
the
report
comes
out
of
our
fort
grant
industrial
school
which
is
entirely
for
delinquent
children.
they
indicate
that
their
number
of
repeaters
is
extremely
low.
and
that's
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
ones
who
where
in
their
once
normally
then
come
back.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
i
think
they're
very
--
in
‘54
--
'64,
i
believe
it
was
in
the
20%
bracket.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
have
the
court
respectfully
bear
in
mind
that
when
the
state
acts
as
the
parens
patriae
in
place
of
the
parent,
it
does
in
fact
do
that.
now,
i
would
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
just
bear
in
mind
that
we're
dealing
here
with
the
child.
now,
this
is
a
completely
different,
if
i
may
start
with
my
argument
from
this
basis,
a
completely
different
individual
that
than
an
adult.
all
through
a
child's
adolescent
years,
he
goes
through
period
of
limited
freedom.
he
doesn't
know
absolute
liberty
and
freedom
as
such
is
known
to
an
adult.
i
mean,
he
has
no
absolute
right
to
go
out
and
drive
a
car,
he
has
a
limited
right
to
contract.
he
doesn't
have
personal
liberty
to
avoid
compulsory
education.
his
entire
adolescent
years
in
many
cases
a
direct
indication
of
just
how
he
is
going
to
be
brought
up
is
directly
dependent
on
what
proper
parental
restraints
are
placed
upon
him.
if
a
child
needs
necessary
restraints
the
parent
gives
it
to
him.
and
i
think
this
was
the
basic
feature
behind
the
first
juvenile
court.
the
state
steps
in
and
tries
its
very
best
when
the
parent
is
not
doing
the
job
to
do
that
job
in
the
parent's
place.
now,
the
facts
this
case
will
bear
a
--
or
lend
a
great
degree
of
credence
to
the
statements
that
i'm
making
here
today.
this
is
not
--
was
not
a
waiver
proceeding
in
our
estimation
based
on
the
record.
we
don't
think
it
was
a
case
of
which
a
child
denied
to
tell
the
judge
all
and
i
think
his
statements
indicated
that
he
had
stated
some
of
the
lewd
remarks
that
were
made
on
the
phone.
the
facts
as
stated
by
mr.
dorsen
were
basically
correct.
however,
he
made
one
statement
that
i
had
previously
just
touched
upon
that
at
june
there
were
two
hearings.
the
boy
was
picked
up
directly
on
the
eighth.
he
was
placed
in
a
detention
home
in
this
very,
very
small
community
in
arizona,
globe,
arizona.
and
the
probation
officer
who
was
directly
involved
in
this
case,
probation
officer
flagg,
stated
that
he
did
not
come
back
to
the
probation
center
as
part
of
his
activities
until
late
around
in
the
afternoon
of
the
eighth.
he
immediately
went
down
to
the
detention
home
and
this
was
i
believe
in
the
early
hours
of
the
evening.
concurrently,
therewith,
mrs.
gault
came
home
and
found
out
her
son
had
been
picked
up
by
the
police
and
he
was
down
to
the
detention
center.
they
met
at
that
time.
now,
this
was
a
day
before
the
hearing.
flagg
who
was
one
of
two
probation
officers
on
the
staff
of
the
juvenile
court
in
that
county
spoke
to
mrs.
gault
and
his
statement
as
i
have
related
my
brief
is
to
the
effect
that
he
talked
to
mrs.
gault,
he
explained
everything
to
her.
mrs.
gault
also
admitted
that
this
conversation
took
place.
she
admitted
that
when
she
talked
to
probation
officer
flagg,
he
said,
“i
am
going
to
try
to
set
the
hearing
up
for
3
pm
tomorrow.”
now,
on
june
9th,
this
first
hearing
took
place
as
related
by
mr.
dorsen.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
warrant
obtained
but
i
think
the
record
while
it
is
not
specifically
passed
on
this
issue
will
show
that
on
that
specific
date,
the
father
was
away
on
his
job
some
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
up
in
the
grand
canyon
area.
his
mother
was
working.
the
boy
was
home
alone.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
we
would
like
to
think
of
that
as
a
detention
centers
is
getting
the
center
of
our
attention,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
but
the
juvenile
officer
who
by
law
is
required
to
be
contacted
immediately
in
his
best
discretion
decided
that
the
proper
procedure
in
this
case
was
to
have
the
boy
taken
to
the
detention
center.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
not
all
cases
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
not
in
all
cases.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
not
in
all
cases.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
mr.
chief
justice,
this
did
not
take
place.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
this
did
not
take
place.
there
was
no
written
notice
left
at
the
home.
we
as
appellees
in
this
case
tried
to
justify
it
to
the
respect
that
flagg
who
was
out
during
the
day
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
detention
center
happened
to
meet
mrs.
gault
and
we
would
presume
that
if
he
had
been
there
earlier
there
would
have
been
an
actual
notice.
he
testified
he
talked
to
her,
specifically
informed
her
about
what
the
complaint
contained
and
he
also
specifically
told
her
where
when
the
hearing
was
to
take
place.
no
subsequent
written
notes.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
they
did
not.
they
did
not.
the
very,
very
important
factor
i
think
that
goes
to
the
entire
panoramic
view
of
this
case
is
that
the
boy
was
not
new
nor
was
his
parents,
completely
new
to
this
type
of
state
action.
the
boy
had
his
first
scrape
with
the
law
back
in
1962
when
as
the
counsel
has
stated
there
was
a
theft
to
the
baseball
glove.
now,
this
was
disposed
of
through
the
probation
office
intake
procedure.
there
was
no
formal
complaint
made,
but
with
a
small
type
of
an
office
that
i
know
that
they
have
in
gila
county.
this
was
a
thing
that
was
a
common
knowledge
to
them.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
other
than
there
was
no
written
record
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
it's
just
that
--
where
in
this
case
as
a
factual
matter,
the
judge
was
there
back
in
1962,
these
probation
officers
were
there
in
‘62
and
they
handled
it.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
he
was
not
asked
to
delve
into
that
specific
issue,
his
statements
on
the
fact
show
he
was
well
aware
of
what
the
facts
of
the
case
were.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that's
correct.
well,
the
judge
indicated
that
--
judge
mcghee
that
this
was
not
the
entire
criteria
involved.
the
boy
was
still
on
probation
from
the
february
2nd,
1964
adjudication
of
delinquency
when
he
was
involved
with
that
grand
theft.
and
being
on
probation,
i
think
the
court
went
through
their
adjudicatory
proceeding
determined
whether
or
not
the
facts
as
alleged
on
this
occasion
took
place
and
they
took
into
effect
the
fact
that
the
boy
was
already
on
probation.
he
was
not
responding
to
their
therapeutic
approach
that
the
court
was
trying
to
afford
him.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
was
the
basic
substance
of
that
prior
probation
and
i
know
the
court
is
limited
to
in
this
case
the
order
signed
by
the
court
under
that
occasion.
they
determined
the
boy
could
be
delinquent
and
just
what
the
provisions
of
his
probationary
period
were.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
the
basic
framework,
your
honor,
i
would
say,
was
complied
with.
we
think
it
was
as
far
as
a
notice
is
concerned,
as
far
as
going
through
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
as
we
think
it
should
be
you
held.
the
fact
that
the
parents
were
given
notice
of
the
hearing,
our
court
said
that
if
the
boy
had
in
their
estimation
denied
the
charges,
they
would
have
definitely
had
a
reasonable
period
of
time
in
which
to
prepare
a
defense.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
i
understand.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
that
is
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
the
arizona
court
based
its
decision
with
the
fact
that
they
were
going
along
with
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
have
held
similarly
on
similar
points
they
did
not
go
into
the
extreme
citation
stage
that
they
could
have.
i
mean
the
case
law
up
until
now
is
relatively
replete
with
cases
that
have
passed
on
the
same
identical
subjects
where
the
courts
had
accepted
the
parens
patriae
doctrine.
they
have
said
that
we
recognize
the
child
is
entitled
to
due
process
or
the
question
is
what
does
due
process
require
in
this
special
tribunal
and
they
have
balanced
on
the
one
hand
as
i
have
mentioned
the
needs
of
the
individual
and
on
the
other
hand
adjust
what
the
goals
of
the
quality
are
in
recognizing
the
type
of
individual
being
dealt
with.
they
have
confronted
the
question
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
i
--
of
course,
i
speak
through
the
mouth
now
of
our
supreme
court
who
interpreted
our
statute
by
saying
the
constitutional
--
not
the
constitutional
but
the
requirements
of
fair
play
and
due
process
require
notice.
and
i
cannot
be
absolutely
sure
but
well
i
know
in
cases
gone
by,
cases
decided
that
there
was
no
right
to
notice
state
act
with
this
parens
patriae.
it
could
do
that
as
it
would
without
notice.
we
here
are
saying
that
that
is
required
and
that
these
are
one
of
the
injections
into
our
juvenile
code
that
i
think
will
take
away
from
the
immediate
splash
made
by
mr.
dorsen
that
our
juvenile
code
is
briefed
of
any
protection
whatsoever.
what
we're
trying
to
equalize
what
is
needed
and
what
is
required.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
if
one
was
to
accept
the
principle
that
a
child
has
the
same
absolute
rights
as
a
parent,
then
one
would
only
have
one
hurdle
remaining.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
in
regards
to
taking
the
juvenile
and
sending
him
to
the
state?
mr.
frank
a.
parks
we
tend
to
think
it's
not
confinement
merely
because
his
liberty,
he
is
limited
to
the
parental
restraint
levels.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
we
look
at
it
from
this
point.
it
is
very
difficult
and
i
think
it
would
be
naïve
to
argue
that
when
the
child
goes
to
an
industrial
school
he
has
the
right
to
walk
out
the
gate
any
time
he
wants
to.
this
is
not
true.
the
child
is
sent
there
for
training.
it's
just
like
saying
if
you're
going
to
be
sent
to
school
you're
going
to
school
from
eight
until
four
or
whatever
the
hours
are
and
you
may
leave
at
4
o'clock
and
come
home.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
he
is
there
on
a
24-hour
basis
depending
on
what
the
provisions
are
for
perhaps
his
temporary
release.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
if
one
would
consider
it
a
penal
institution.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
the
record
shows
the
father
was
constantly
away.
there
were
statements
made
by
judge
mcghee
to
the
effect
that
after
having
made
an
investigation
they
didn't
think
that
the
parents
were
performing
the
function
they
should.
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
perhaps
one
of
the
items
involved
is
just
what
function
the
parents
have
claimed.
and
if
you
got
a
good
child
who's
not
being
helped
by
his
parents
as
he
should,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
child,
your
honor,
to
attempt
to
keep
him
on
the
straight
road
of
life
until
he
gets
to
the
age
of
21
when
he's
on
his
own.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
this
is
a
prerogative
of
the
juvenile
court
as
far
as
sending
them
home
if
they
wish.
the
court
here
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
yes,
sir.
he
has
the
option
of
taking
the
child
away
from
the
parents
and
putting
him
in
a
training
school
or
it
is
merely
an
act
of
delinquency
which
has
no
correlation
to
the
family
life
that
the
juvenile
judge
has
the
ability
to
say
the
boy
is
going
home,
stay
at
home,
and
you'll
have
a
curfew,
he'll
go
to
group
sessions.
he
will
have
these
requirements
placed
upon
him.
it
depends
on
each
individual
situation.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
and
this
leads
me
to
a
point
that
has
not
been
brought
out
and
i
think
that
they
track
a
bit
from
the
harshness
of
the
disposition
that
was
made
by
the
juvenile
judge.
gerald
gault
is
no
longer
in
fort
grant
state
industrial
school.
and
i
bring
up
these
factors
for
two
reasons
it
perhaps
would
have
rendered
this
case
moot.
but
under
our
arizona
law,
when
a
child
is
sent
to
the
industrial
school,
he
is
under
the
exclusive
control
of
the
state
board
of
directors
of
institutions
for
juveniles.
he
is
under
their
exclusive
control
on
jurisdiction
until
he
reaches
his
majority
or
he
is
absolutely
released.
now,
in
this
case,
one
of
the
ramifications
of
the
individualized
treatment
shows
that
on
december
9th
of
1964,
in
other
words
about
five
months
after
he
was
committed,
the
boy
was
replaced
in
his
home
under
what
is
commonly
called
our
home
placement
program.
and
it's
a
conditional
release
where
under
many,
many
circumstances
the
boy
is
allowed
to
go
home
for
a
weekend.
and
then
he
is
taken
back
to
the
institution
for
training,
for
development,
for
guidance
during
the
week
and
allowed
to
go
home.
he
is
presently
at
our
latest
report
still
with
his
parents
and
as
a
result
of
the
adjudication
here
he
spent
only
five
months
in
our
industrial
school.
they
applied
what
they
thought
was
needed
on
the
boy
and
now
he
hasn't
been
in
trouble
since
december
9th
of
1964.
now,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
this
renders
this
moot.
in
others
words,
it
was
raised
before
it
came
here.
we
thought
not
for
the
basic
reason
that
the
boy
did
not
have
his
absolute
release.
he
was
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
our
board
of
directors
anytime
he
could
be
taken
back
without
a
hearing,
etcetera.
i
think
my
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
it
is
our
position
mr.
chief
justice
that
whether
or
not
a
complaining
party
should
be
there
is
directly
dependent
and
commingled
the
question
of
whether
or
not
when
in
a
fatherly
manner
the
juvenile
judge
says,
“gerald,
what
went
on?
what
did
you
do?”
and
the
boy
says,
“well,
judge,
i
called
the
number
and
i
said
some
of
the
words
on
the
phone.”
mr.
frank
a.
parks
and
i'd
say
it
wasn't
an
arizona
juvenile
judge,
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
our
supreme
court
reviewing
the
entire
record
thought
that
the
statements
that
were
made
and
there
was
one
person
who
held
a
view
that
gerald
did
not
make
the
admission.
that
was
mrs.
gault,
she
was
the
one
who
was
at
the
june
9th
adjudicatory
hearing.
the
father
wasn't
there.
at
that
hearing,
there
were
statements
made
as
to
could
you
hear
what
was
stated?
did
you
know
what
was
going
on?
and
through
her
testimony
on
occasion
she
says,
i
think
they
said
this
i
think
they
said
that.
now
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct,
your
honor
in
regard
to
the
second
hearing
on
june
15th.
now,
this
would
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
sir.
that
on
june
9th
was
the
first
hearing
and
that
statement
which
was
made
by
probation
officer
flagg
and
judge
mcghee
is
that
at
the
june
9th
hearing
gerald
admitted
making
some
of
the
statements.
flagg
testified
that
at
the
june
15th
hearing
the
boy
recanted
and
said
that
he
didn't.
then
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
judge
and
the
probation
officer
because
the
judge
said
that
the
boy
told
him
again
on
the
15th
that
he
had
made
some
of
the
statements.
and
i
can
just
state
that
our
supreme
court
selected
the
facts
and
decided
that
the
boy
had
in
fact
made
the
admissions
that
were
contended
on
our
behalf
during
the
appeal
and
that
there
was
no
need
to
go
into
the
confrontation
issue
because
there
were
in
fact
admissions
and
now
--
mr.
frank
a.
parks
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
was
a
case
of
first
instance
in
that
regard
in
arizona
on
this
issue
and
they
are
directly
saying
that
the
boy
admits
that
there
is
no
relevant
issue
on
that
subject
and
they
have
disposed
of
it.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
i
know
that
deals
with
cases
of
where
i
believe
there's
a
question
of
who
is
an
accomplice
and
who
is
a
--
if
there
is
a
violation
involved
if
they
are
an
accomplice
i
don't
know
of
any
specific
cases
where
any
statement
by
a
juvenile
has
to
be
corroborated
before
it's
acceptable
for
it's
probative
value.
i
would
like
to
just
move
on
to
i
think
probably
one
of
the
most
important
areas
and
that
is
the
right
to
counsel.
i
have
relinquished
certain
portion
of
my
time
to
and
mr.
merritt
green
presenting
the
ohio
association
of
juvenile
court
judges
who
would
like
to
make
some
statements
on
the
case
at
hand.
the
positions
being
taken
by
appellants
in
regard
to
the
right
of
counsel
are
based
entirely
upon
what
they
consider
and
believed
to
be
the
requirements
of
due
process.
in
doing
so,
they
are
definitely
and
entirely
acquitting
the
juvenile
proceeding
to
a
criminal
trial.
we
contend
that
this
is
not
so.
our
statute
specifically
holds;
it
is
not
to
be
considered
a
juvenile
or
a
criminal
trial,
a
child
is
not
convicted
if
he
is
found
delinquent.
his
statements
can
in
no
way
be
considered
a
conviction
of
a
crime.
our
state
has
gone
perhaps
one
step
farther
by
trying
to
protect
the
child
as
much
as
possible
by
requiring
that
two
years
after
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
the
records
will
be
destroyed.
our
legislature
saw
this
as
a
means
of
avoiding
the
problems
of
when
the
boy
gets
to
the
20
and
21
where
he
has
the
record
available
for
perhaps
civil
service
or
the
fbi
to
see,
that
is
destroyed.
we
have
specific
provisions
for
the
destruction
of
those
records.
we
like
to
think
that
this
is
a
means
of
taking
this
proceeding
and
if
it
has
performed
its
function
of
taking
it
and
dispensing
with
it.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
and
therefore,
dispensing
with
any
potential
problems
that
could
arise
out
of
that
hearing
beyond
what
was
contemplated
by
our
statute.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
your
honor,
title
8
section
238
in
our
juvenile
code
provides
for
the
destruction
of
records
after
two
years
after
the
discharge
of
the
child
from
the
institutions
in
which
he
may
have
been
committed.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
they
make
a
specific
mention
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
destroys
the
records
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
of
course,
i
couldn't
make
a
specific
statement
that
in
all
cases
the
proceedings
are
destroyed
and
the
background
information
is
retained.
i
should
imagine
that
in
some
cases
there
is
a
variance
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
think
by
the
requirements
of
statute
it's
only
required
that
they
destroy
a
record
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
there's
a
possibility
that
that
is
true.
as
to
the
right
to
counsel,
i
necessarily
find
myself
arguing
a
philosophical
point
of
view
which
is
the
basic
foundation
of
our
juvenile
system.
we
don't
think
the
word
liberty
is
used
in
the
same
sense
that
that
word
is
used
in
our
constitutional
provisions.
we
think
that
of
course
there's
a
clear
cleavage
between
our
position
and
appellants
that
we
think
the
probation
officer
can
serve
a
function
for
the
child
which
either
remove
as
much
of
a
traumatic
experience
for
the
child
as
possible,
probation
officer
acts
for
the
child.
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
probation
officer
be
present
during
the
hearings
and
represent
the
interest
of
the
child.
of
course
the
appellants
take
the
position
that
this
is
not
possible.
i
argue
not
in
the
same
vein
as
one
would
have
perhaps
argued
the
miranda
decision
that
we
don't
need
this
type
of
procedure
because
it's
not
required.
there's
an
added
factor
here.
there
is
a
reason
why
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
at
this
proceeding
shouldn't
be
a
rule
absolute.
our
court
definitely
left
the
discretion
of
the
appointment
of
counsel
up
to
juvenile
judge
and
i
can
say
with
a
great
degree
of
frankness,
there
are
many,
many
proceedings
in
the
state
of
arizona
where
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
judge
is
used
to
say
in
this
case
we
think
counsel
is
required
and
therefore
it
shall
be.
this
is
a
case
where
the
judge
did
not
use
that
specific
discretion.
we
think
a
rule
absolute
would
require
or
would
destroy
the
flexibility
of
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
court
--
supreme
court
decided
back
and
i
believe
in
the
early
1950s
that
if
the
parents
wish
to
retain
counsel,
they
have
that
right
to
retain
counsel
of
their
own
choosing.
and
counsel
cannot
be
prohibited
from
performing
whatever
function
they
see
fit
at
that
hearing.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
there
--
there
is
a
distinction
mr.
chief
justice
between
what
the
court
perhaps
would
think
is
the
best
procedure
for
the
child.
they
might
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
just
came
in
here
to
encourage
the
boy
to
talk
as
the
first
means
of
rehabilitation.
it
would
work
better
without
counsel
to
perhaps
just
tidy
that
process
but
we
can't
go
so
far
as
to
say
because
we
think
that
specific
procedure
is
correct
we're
going
to
say
you
cannot
have
the
right
to
counsel
appointed
on
your
behalf.
in
other
words,
if
the
parent
so
wishes
we
didn't
think,
our
supreme
court
did
not
think
that
we
had
the
power
to
say,
“no,
you
are
going
to
be
prevented
from
doing
that.”
this
was
the
concept
of
fair
play.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
shall
have
counsel
in
the
circumstances
needed
and
that
the
circumstances
in
the
case
might
perhaps
warn
them,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
--
as
far
as
the
general
subject
on
counsel,
philosophically
it
is
our
position
that
the
spirit
of
law
rather
than
the
absolute
letter
constitutional
constructions
which
i
agree
individuals
can
go
and
pick
out
certain
statements
made
in
constitutional
questions
and
justify
their
position.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
in
balancing
the
needs
of
the
individual
and
the
goal
of
equality
that
the
spirit
of
the
law
rather
than
the
absolute
letter
of
the
law
would
require
this
court
to
accept
the
juvenile
proceeding
the
way
it
has
been
functioning
and
the
way
it
will
function
in
the
future.
i
guess
i'll
make
my
final
statement
on
the
right
against
self-incrimination
just
to
give
the
court
some
of
the
reasons
that
individuals
who
have
commented
on
the
subject
have
stated
there
is
a
reason
why
the
child
should
not
be
informed
of
that
right.
our
court
specifically
did
not
say
the
child
doesn't
have
the
right
only
that
the
court
did
not
have
to
advise
in
that
right.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
there's
no
criminal
conviction
involved,
number
one.
number
two,
a
refusal
for
the
child
to
testify
or
to
talk
to
the
judge
cannot
be
punished
if
in
many
cases
just
indicates
the
fact
that
the
child
is
antagonist
from
the
society
unwilling
to
cooperate
showing
a
further
need
for
perhaps
additional
guidance.
there's
no
prosecutor
present.
there
is
no
individual
twist
what
the
child
says.
we
would
prefer
to
think
of
our
juvenile
judges
as
talking
with
the
child
in
the
most
reasonable
perspective
encouraging
him
to
tell
the
truth.
as
far
as
the
right
to
appeal
and
the
right
to
a
transcript
i
would
just
rest
on
the
statements
made
in
my
brief
and
to
the
effect
that
we
think
the
decisions
on
the
subject
at
the
present
time
indicate
this
is
not
a
denial
of
due
process.
i'm
now
relinquished
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
mr.
green.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
well,
i
know
as
mr.
dorsen
stated
many
of
the
states
are
varying
now.
i
know
there
are
five
that
require
appointment
of
counsel
after
request
and
to
finding
it.
in
arizona
it
is
left
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
judge.
mr.
frank
a.
parks
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
decision
of
our
arizona
supreme
court.
now,
the
point
of
counsel,
your
honor,
we
got
to
--
then
the
decision
is
left
to
the
juvenile
judge
that
he
thinks
it
is
required.
and
i
would
say
that
in
our
most
populous
county
or
state,
this
is
a
procedure
that
is
given
entirely
if
the
parents
ask
for
counsel.
the
court
bends
over
backwards
to
give
it
if
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
they
think
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
require
that.
it's
up
to
the
judge,
your
honor.
