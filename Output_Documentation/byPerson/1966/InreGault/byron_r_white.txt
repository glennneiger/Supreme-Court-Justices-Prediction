justice
byron
r.
white
or
rather
a
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
trial
de
novo
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
transcript?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dorsen
would
you
apply
the
same
idea
to
all
the
state
in
the
hearing
of
the
juvenile
court
you
say
on
a
delinquency
and
--
are
you
speaking
technically
of
the
hearing
on
delinquency
or
would
you
include
hearing
on
disposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
certainly
would
have
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
call
for
a
confrontation
or
things
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
terms
of
the
procedure
for
establishing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
go
for
the
--
then
you
would
identify
the
same
rule
to
the
preliminary
hearing
that
in
some
states
they
might
have
a
preliminary
hearing
to
determine
whether
to
file
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
don't
you
have
to
think
about
these
things
in
deciding
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it
will
come
up
all
the
time
whether
or
not
there's
been
an
event
in
the
complaint
against
somebody
against
some
child
in
the
question
of
whether
to
file
or
not
and
the
--
would
you
say
that
the
probation
officer
or
whatever
or
the
social
service
worker
who's
determining
whether
the
form
of
petition
or
the
report
should
be
filed
--
should
talk
to
the
child
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say?
that
he
should
talk
to
his
parents?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
his
counsel
should
be
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
about
a
public
trial
i
don't
suppose
that
in
terms
of
the
public
constitutional
rights
of
public
trial
that
the
defendant
in
nature
--
the
senior
defendant
and
the
prosecutor,
the
court
room
can
be
locked
up.
and
if
the
press
wants
in,
the
press
gets
in
and
what
we
can
say
about
that
and
it
feels
more
a
important
thing,
so
both
the
parents,
the
child
and
the
court
wants
to
have
it
closed,
somebody
else's
like
they
take
a
man
because
no,
we
don't
want
to
close.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
--
and
all
we
have
here
is
these
main
remarks
to
what
you
refer.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
more
question,
could
you
tell
me
to
what
extent
around
the
country
the
judge
sees
is
the
social
studies
before
determining
delinquency?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
--
is
it
widespread
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
family
backgrounds
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
they'll
be
trying
out
the
specific
fact
of
whether
someone
is
maybe
lewd
phone
call.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
delinquency
decision
on
whether
he's
delinquent
or
not
may
not
be
limited
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
if
it
isn't
limited
to
that
every
fact
upon
which
the
determination
of
delinquency
must
be
tried
out
even
though
the
judges
would
look
--
i
never
hold
a
fellow
that
boy
to
be
a
delinquent
just
on
the
basis
of
one
act
just
depends
on
the
whole
background.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
judge
says
well
i'll
take
one
issue
then
did
he
make
the
phone
call
and
then
i'll
consider
that
all
the
rest
of
this
information
is
only
relevant
in
disposition.
i'll
find
him
to
be
a
delinquent
and
all
the
rest
of
this
information
is
available
to
account.
it's
always
the
question
of
disposition
whether
i
will
put
him
on
probation
or
whether
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
--
do
you
think
this
is
such
a
big
crossroad
right
in
this
case
for
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
case
is
no
crossroads
for
them
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
california?
how
about
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
take
that
illinois.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
i'm
just
--
you
say
this
is
the
crossroad
for
the
juvenile
court
system.
well
that
may
be
true
in
your
statement.
it
may
be
true
in
certain
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
will
say
why
you
think
that
that
view
of
yours
requires
that
the
prior
--
the
evidentiary
hearing
the
state
place
that
i
viewed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
expect
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
speaks
for
the
juvenile
in
this
respect,
mr.
dorsen?
do
you
contend,
in
respect
to
the
counsel,
let's
assume
there's
an
advice
to
the
child
that
you
have
the
right
to
counsel.
he
looks
to
his
father
and
the
father
says,
“we
don't
want
counsel.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
speaks
to
the
--
so
the
judge
shouldn't
think
the
father
has
agreed
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
the
child
waive
a
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
view
the
thing
as
in
every
single
case
that
there
necessarily
must
be
a
counsel
for
the
juvenile
even
if
the
parent
is
represented.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
get
out
--
how
do
you
get
out
of
it?
there
has
to
be
counsel
but
he
can't
waive
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
different.
you
say
he's
represented,
he
could
have
represented
both
parents
otherwise,
we
were
then
--
he
could
have
represented
both
but
you
would
have
to
make
sure
that
the
child
is
represented.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
there
has
to
be
a
lawyer
in
the
courtroom.
some
lawyer
has
to
be
in
the
courtroom
every
time
there
is
a
determination
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
or
rather
a
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
trial
de

on
that?
justice
byron

in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a

justice
byron

white
mr.
