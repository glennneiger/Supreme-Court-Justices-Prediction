do

provide

is
that
in

chief

if
it's
in

don't
bother.
and
go
right
on
with
your
argument.

the

required

chief

all
right,

was
any
written
notice
left
for
the
parents
when
the
boy
was
taken
or
any
word
given
to
anybody
in
the
household
for
where
the
boy
has
gone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
she
had
to
get
that
information
from
neighbors
or
someone
else
around
the
place?
the
officers
left
no
notice
to
the
parents
at
all,
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
parks,
i
was
wondering
about
the
request
that
the
parents
made
for
the
recipient
of
this
telephone
call,
the
woman
who
received
the
telephone
call
to
be
brought
to
the
hearing
for
examination
as
to
whether
it
was
this
boy's
voice
or
the
voice
of
the
other
one
and
the
judge
said
as
i
read
some
place,
they
don't
have
to
come
here.
but
what
about
that
so
far
as
the
parent
here
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
mr.
parks
that
at
that
time
when
they
asked
for
the
woman
to
be
pressed
that
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
between
the
boy
and
the
authorities
as
to
whether
he
had
spoken
any
if
those
lewd
words.
and
that
they
wanted
her
there
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
that
it
was
the
other
boy's
voice
and
not
his
voice
on
the
telephone.
now,
that
it
would
seem
to
me
would
be
enough
of
a
denial,
so
if
there
was
the
right
of
confrontation
of
witnesses
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
have
that
woman
present
so
she
could
be
examined
as
to
whose
voice
it
was.
now,
i
may
have
say
that
the
facts
inaccurately
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
the
probation
officer
would
also
indicate
that
the
boy
had
not
admitted
that--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
the
time
when
they
asked
for
the
woman
to
be
present?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
your
juvenile
court
judge
have
the
right
to
say,
no
lawyer
can
represent
a
child
in
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
how
you
would
distinguish
so
the
situation
where
if
the
child
of
a
wealthy
family
wants
to
bring
a
lawyer
there
to
represent
the
child
that
they
can
do
so
and
he
can
have
representation
all
the
way
through
the
proceeding
on
the
theory
that
it
will
be
helpful
to
him.
but
on
the
other
hand,
a
poor
family
that
can't
afford
an
attorney
must
remain
for
everyone
and
must
rely
on
the
probation
officer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
do
you
think
it
represents
a
fair
play
for
the
judge
himself
to
determine
whether
the
child
shall
have
counsel.
