mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
discussion
up
to
this
point
has
confused
the
concepts
of
competition
and
convenience
and
needs.
the
argument
of
the
department
of
justice
seems
to
be
predicated
upon
the
equation
of
competition
in
convenience
and
needs,
for
although
the
department
has
conceded
in
argument
that
it
considers
and
has
always
agreed
in
the
courts
below
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
has
resulted
in
different
standards
or
that
it
has
accepted
the
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
what
they
mean
by
the
standards
of
bma
66.
for
example
in
the
crocker-anglo
case
in
california,
subsequent
to
--
that
case
was
tried
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
subsequent
to
the
act's
passage,
the
three-judge
court
in
the
northern
district
held
a
further
hearing
and
invited
all
parties
to
submit
additional
evidence
and
at
that
time
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
intervened
as
a
party
in
accordance
with
the
right
given
to
him
by
the
bank
merger
act.
they
also
--
and
by
the
briefs
--
and
in
its
brief,
the
department
took
the
position,
"it
is
of
course
the
essential
position
of
the
government
that
the
1966
amendment
to
the
bank
merger
act
has
not
resulted
in
any
substantial
change
in
substantive
antitrust
law
or
in
the
standard
used
by
the
courts
in
determining
the
legality
of
bank
mergers."
again
in
the
crocker
case,
the
department
told
the
court
that
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served
is
but
a
reiteration
of
the
failing-company
doctrine
long
recognized
as
an
integral
part
of
subtle
antitrust
laws.
thus
incidentally,
this
position
was
cited
by
the
crocker
court
in
its
opinion
of
october
6
which
remanded
the
cases
to
the
comptroller
for
further
findings,
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
now,
is
not
adopted
by
the
court
in
california.
again
in
the
case
of
u.s.v.
third
national
bank
in
nashville
which
was
filed
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
but
tried
fully
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
that
act,
the
department
again
represented
to
the
court
that
the
standards
probably
codified
the
somewhat
greater
contours
of
the
failing-company
doctrine
which
was
adverted
to
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
opinion.
and
again
in
the
provident
case
which
is
now
before
the
court
and
as
a
statement
of
position
immediately
prior
to
the
dismissal
of
this
action,
the
department
took
the
case
that
--
took
the
position
that
it
was
the
solvency
of
banks
which
was
to
be
weighed
against
the
anticompetitive
effects.
so,
the
department
has
taken
the
position
really
that
the
act
has
done
nothing
but
impose
a
tougher
anticompetitive
standard
upon
banks
or
that
has
codified
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
now
we
are
somewhat
concerned
that
the
representation
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
that
the
department
has
always
conceded
in
the
courts
below
that
the
standards
of
the
new
act
applied
to
bank
mergers
and
litigation
is
nothing
more
than
an
assertion
by
him
that
clayton
7
still
applies
in
full
force
and
effect
for
if
the
bank
merger
act
merely
incorporates
the
standards
of
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
and
the
failing-company
doctrine
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
then
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
on
the
standards
that
he
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes
i
do.
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
position
of
the
department
here
is
that
each
of
the
factors
--
and
this
is
the
way
i
understood
the
argument,
that
each
of
the
factors
which
might
be
decided
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
under
the
convenience
and
needs
portion
of
this
statute
are
only
those
factors
which
somehow
or
another
relate
to
competition.
and
therefore
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
well,
i
believe
you're
--
we're
talking
about
a
different
aspect
here
mr.
justice
black.
i
believe
that
the
department
has
taken
the
position
that
the
--
there
is
no
basic
difference
between
convenience
and
needs
and
competition
that
each
of
the
convenience
and
needs
facts
or
determinations
by
the
comptroller,
only
those
to
competition,
whether
or
not
it's
probably
pro-competition.
so
in
effect
they
are
turning
the
terms
of
this
act
and
to
--
direction
to
the
comptroller
or
the
banking
agency
to
weigh
the
anticompetitive
effect
of
a
merger
against
the
pro-competitive
effect
of
a
merger.
now,
this
of
course
is
negated
by
the
terms
of
the
act
itself
where
section
4
of
the
act
specifically
is
the
banking
agency,
the
right
to
approve
a
merger
involving
a
bank
that
is
in
danger
of
failing
without
asking
the
department
of
justice
for
an
advisory
report.
as
the
banking
agencies
are
required
to
ask
in
a
case
with
a
bank
that
it's
solving,
or
whether
it
might
be
substantial,
anticompetitive
effects.
there
is
no
point
in
congress
having
asked
an
act
which
does
nothing
more
than
codify
the
failing-company
doctrine
in
the
an
--
in
antitrust
law
because
nobody
has
ever
challenged
the
failing-company
doctrine.
and
this
goes
directly
to
the
constitutional
issue
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
authorization
of
a
merger
by
a
banking
agency
is
a
function
that
under
this
act
is
delegated
directly
to
that
agency
by
the
congress.
and
it
is
definitely
a
legislative
act
being
performed
by
the
comptroller
or
the
banking
agency
involved.
convenience
and
needs
means
nothing
more
than
competition,
then
obviously
the
courts
have
always
been
considered
competent
to
assess
competitive
effects
and
it's
properly
a
judicial
function.
but
the
court
is
not
allowed
and
cannot
be
granted
the
power
by
congress
to
go
around
chartering
banks,
authorizing
branches
for
banks
or
to
approve
mergers
by
banks
is
very
definitely
a
legislative
function
they
cannot
be
constitutionally
delegated
to
a
district
court.
now,
convenience
and
needs
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
well,
as
i
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
don't
believe
so
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
department
arrest
--
the
department
relies
mr.
justice
fortas
upon
several
cases
in
which
the
court
has
apparently
done
that,
the
california,
the
ftc,
the
el
paso
case,
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
and
i
believe
there's
another
one,
the
rca
case.
and
yet
in
the
california
case,
this
court
in
writing
its
opinion
pointed
out
that
in
all
of
these
cases
that
the
department
is
relying
upon,
there
was
no
permissive
legislative
scheme
by
which
the
agency
was
required
to
balance
antitrust
considerations
against
the
public
convenience
and
needs.
in
those
cases
where
the
statute
does
require
that,
this
court
has
in
effect
upheld
the
agency
on
review.
i
might
cite
the
seaboard
case
for
one,
and
the
panagra
case
for
another.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
he
decided
on
both,
mr.
justice
fortas,
he
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
decided
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
he
decided
first
that
there
was
no
substantial
anticompetitive
effect
under
the
terms
of
the
new
statute
which
according
to
the
legislative
history,
we
believe,
permits,
and
requires
the
courts
to
take
into
consideration
all
the
financial
institutions
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
rather
than
just
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i'm
not
sure
he
states
that,
not
many
words
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
last
paragraph
of
his
opinion
which
appears
on
page
112
b
of
the
appendix
of
the
philadelphia
bank
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
but,
pursuant
to
the
1966
amendment
to
the
bank
merger
act,
we
find
that
the
merger
of
provident
--
that
provident
national
bank
and
central
penn
national
bank
clearly
conforms
to
the
statutory
criteria
and
is
in
the
public
interest
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
which
is
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
correct.
that's
correct
your
honor
and
in
--
that
prior
to
--
the
body
of
the
opinion
--
there's
a
thorough
analysis
of
the
competitive
effects
of
this
particular
merger
and
the
discussion
of
the
benefits
to
the
community.
although
he
didn't
come
out
in
the
--
and
used
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
must
be
inferred
that
in
making
his
determination
in
the
final
paragraph
of
this
opinion
that
he
conformed
to
the
statutory
language.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
know
something
about
it
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
that
is
correct
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
of
course
comptroller
saxon
was
the
comptroller
at
the
time
that
it
was
issued
and
the
supplementary
opinion
was
given
to
the
court
as
the
opinion
of
the
new
comptroller
because
of
the
change
in
comptroller.
that
was
solely
it.
i
don't
think
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
new
comptroller
to
wish
an
opinion
at
all
but
he
felt
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
have
his
views.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes,
and
in
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
in
this
case,
it
says
that
there
are
no
substantial
anticompetitive
effects.
but
that
--
but
regardless
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
might
note
that
they
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
might
note
that
in
arriving
at
the
decision
in
the
houston
case,
the
comptroller
may
have
been
influenced
by
the
decision
in
the
crocker-anglo
case
in
which
the
court
directed
the
comptroller
to
reach
new
findings
under
the
bank
merger
act
and
that
if
he
determine
there
was
no
substantial
anticompetitive
effect,
then
he
was
to
hypothesize
an
anticompetitive
effect
and
advise
the
court
what
his
findings
would
be
in
that
case
upon
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
so
that
could
well
have
been
the
source
of
the
--
that
language.
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes
sir,
of
course
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
judicially
competent?
no.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes.
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
position
because
the
determination
of
convenience
and
needs,
the
determination
of
convenience
and
needs
is
legislative
function
especially
when
it
comes
to
authorizing
something
in
the
future,
a
new
rule
which
in
this
case
is
a
merger
which
creates
an
effect
in
no
institution.
this
is
a
legislative
function
that
cannot
be
delegated
to
the
judiciary.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
it
can
be
because
the
comptroller
is
an
administrative
officer
and
it's
historically
true
that
the
congress
or
a
legislature
can
delegate
any
part
of
its
functions
to
an
administrator.
for
example
--
i
don't
think
anyone
would
deny
that
the
congress
(inaudible)
have
the
right
to
charter
a
bank
and
have
a
new
act
for
each
charter
or
that
it
could
approve
a
merger
and
have
a
new
act
for
each
merger.
but
this
of
course
would
impose
an
insurmountable
burden
upon
the
congress,
so
it
turns
the
duties
over
to
an
administrator.
they
cannot
turn
them
over
to
a
constitutional
court
which
has
a
judicial
function.
now
the
assessment
of
competition
is
certainly
within
the
court's
competence.
but
not
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
court
can
review
--
the
court
can
in
effect
arrive
on
its
own
determination
as
to
competition
in
the
competitive
effect.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
you
can
find
--
under
the
concept
of
review
de
novo,
and
i
might
indicate
mr.
justice
black
and
the
court,
that
the
review
de
novo
was
suggested
originally
in
conferences
between
the
government
agencies
involved
here.
and
it
appears
first
in
the
record
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
it
was
--
appears
first
in
the
record
in
the
january
5th
letter
of
the
attorney
general,
not
in
the
letter
itself
but
in
a
draft
proposal
of
legislation
--
bank
merger
legislation,
but
the
term
review
de
novo
appears
in
that
draft
proposal
and
would
be
--
it
would
be
accurate
to
say
that
that
would
give
the
courts
competence
to
review
the
proposal,
but
the
proposal
may
be
solely
determining
the
legality
of
a
bank
merger,
the
competitive
effect
and
it
included
standards
such
as
convenience
and
needs
only
insofar
as
a
effective
competition.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
in
this
--
with
the
act
as
it
now
stands?
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes,
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
court
may
assess
the
competitive
factors
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
substitute
its
own
opinion
there.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
they
can
review
the
findings
of
the
comptroller.
and
if
it
finds
that
those
--
if
it
finds,
that
the
findings
of
the
comptroller
have
substantial
evidence
behind
them,
if
the
record
has
been
developed
properly,
that
it
must
let
them
stand.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
if
there
has
been
no
hearing
and
insufficient
record,
then
it
must
find
that
the
comptroller
was
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
well,
the
courts
have
done
that.
they
did
this
in
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
in
effect,
yes
if
there
is
not
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
if
there
is
an
insufficient
record,
for
example
no
hearing,
the
court
in
crocker
for
example
was
unwilling
to
--
had
remanded
the
case
to
the
comptroller
for
hearings
and
further
specific
findings
of
facts
in
that
case,
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
upon
the
submission
of
these
findings
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
the
court
called
a
new
hearing
and
invited
the
parties
to
submit
any
new
evidence
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
they
had.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
would
say
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
in
effect,
yes.
but
i
would
say
this
however
that
there
have
been
no
hearings
in
these
cases
and
relying
upon
--
if
the
record
is
complete
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
would
say
mr.
justice
brennan
that
if
the
record
of
the
comptroller
is
--
shows
substantial
evidence
upon
which
he
base
his
discretion,
then
the
court
has
--
cannot
overrule
it,
the
comptroller's
decision.
now
i'm
trying
to
draw
the
distinction
that
the
lower
courts
have
made
in
cases
where
there
have
been
no
particular
hearings.
in
the
smithfield
case
which
is
a
branch
case
for
example,
the
court
said
that
if
there
is
no
hearing
and
no
formal
record
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
let
me
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
brennan.
you
are
asking
if
in
effect
we
are
following
smithfield
here
whether
it
is
--
no
hearing
that
the
court
can
introduce
new
evidence
or
evidence
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
and
make
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
that
the
smithfield
case
held
that
the
court
could
take
evidence
and
reach
findings
of
fact
--
find
--
have
its
own
findings
of
fact.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
but
if
then,
after
looking
at
these
facts
that
it
had
determined,
it
had
found
that
the
determination
of
the
granting
of
a
branch
blessed
upon
the
discretion
of
the
comptroller,
then
the
court
could
not
overturn
the
discretion.
in
other
words,
the
court
was
finding
out
in
the
absence
of
the
record
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
uphold
the
comptroller
and
that's
pre
--
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
here.
the
court
can
find
out
if
no
evidence
and
no
record
exist,
then
the
court
can
move
in
and
find
out
if
the
--
if
there
is
that
type
of
evidence.
but
if
there's
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
decision
of
the
comptroller
which
may
not
be
formulated
in
a
formal
order
or
formal
record,
then
the
court
can
reach
its
own
findings
of
facts
(voice

--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
don't
think
there
is
any
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
no,
he
would
not
have,
however
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
except
that
he
has
gone
one
step
further
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
and
in
fact
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
in
a
case
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
no.
i
believe
in
a
case
like
that
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
facts
of
competition
were
found
not
to
be
true,
that
without
making
any
determination
then
as
to
convenience
and
needs.
i
believe
it
could
be
remanded
to
the
comptroller
for
further
findings.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
that
the
exercise
and
the
expertise
and
the
discretion
of
a
banking
agency
or
any
administrative
agency
charged
with
the
administration
of
any
industry
would
not
be
a
fit
subject
or
judgment
by
a
court
except
that
--
as
to
the
extent
that
if
it
don't
have
substantial
evidence
to
back
it
up.
i
might
note
that
in
talking
about
convenience
and
needs
citing
a
--
in
the
case
of
bank
of
italy
v.
johnson
which
is
251
p.2d
784,
it
discusses
convenience
and
needs
specifically.
it
says
the
phrase
would
seem
to
be
as
difficult
of
definition
as
police
power,
public
convenience
and
necessity,
due
diligence,
or
probable
cause
as
these
expressions
are
used
in
our
law.
the
impossibilities
of
definition
will
not
be
tracked
in
the
least
from
the
necessity
of
understanding
the
task
and
ascertaining
the
fact
in
each
case,
and
it
is
for
the
superintendent
of
bank's
isocracy
and
to
ascertain
them
in
the
exercise
of
his
power.
in
that
exercise,
he
performs
an
executive
or
administrative
function
and
not
a
judicial
one,
and
held
that
the
power
of
the
state
could
not
transfer
a
legislative
or
rather
a
judicial
function
to
a
comptroller.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
he
would
not
have
had
to
get
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
he
is
saying
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
when
one
assesses
the
competitive
effect
of
this
particular
merger.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
but
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
further,
mr.
justice
white,
he
did
state
that
this
did
meet
the
statutory
criteria,
and
was
in
the
public
interest,
and
he
did
consider
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
again
because
of
the
indications
of
the
court,
that
they
wanted
an
alternative
and
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
the
more
substantial
anticompetitive
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
correct
and
he
--
this
gets
on
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
well,
the
competitive
facts
are
fully
discussed
in
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
in
this
case.
every
fact
is
considered
as
lying
--
is
outlined
there
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
and
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
correct.
now
the
--
there
are
several
other
points
here
if
the
court
please.
one
is
that
this
act
was
also
debated
under
the
term
bank
holding
company
amendments
of
1966
some
seven
months
after
this
act
was
passed.
and
it
was
debated
on
the
senate
floor
and
was
opposed
by
senator
hart
who
had
opposed
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
on
the
ground
that
this
act
was,
as
senator
hart
turned
it,
an
unwarranted
weakening
of
the
antitrust
laws.
he
moved
to
strike
the
identical
language
from
the
bank
holding
company
amendments
and
the
senate
reaffirmed
the
language
of
the
bank
merger
act
and
the
implication
that
this
did
not
create
a
tougher
competitive
standard
but
an
entirely
different
standard
for
the
assessment
of
bank
mergers
by
a
vote
of
11
to
64.
the
--
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
brought
up
before
the
question
of
line
of
commerce
and
the
omission
of
the
line
of
commerce.
this
is
not
to
say
that
you
are
going
to
take
in
steamships
and
everything
else
in
assessing
a
bank
merger
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
what
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
what
we
are
saying
in
effect
is
that
it
has
been
expanded
in
this
phrase
as
contained
in
the
report,
house
report.
it
has
been
expanded
to
take
in
the
realities
of
competition.
all
of
those
institution
which
compete
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
it
was
eliminated.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
effect
is
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
what
we
are
doing
if
we
take
a
look
at
the
antitrust
law,
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
we
are
including
a
lot
of
lines
of
commerce
and
saying
that
you
have
to
affect
the
--
or
judge
the
overall
effect
of
the
merger
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
upon
the
cluster
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
the
cluster
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
much
broader,
much
broader
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
financial
institution.
but
--
i
believe
its
--
many
lines
of
commerce
which
must
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
financial
competition.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
we
have
made
the
argument
that
the
line
of
commerce
here
mr.
justice
white
is
money.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
(vioce
overlap)
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
further,
we
believe
that
the
court
should
consider
also
that
mergers
and
the
approval
of
mergers
that
its
only
one
function
of
a
banking
agency.
it
must
effectuate
a
national
banking
policy
particularly
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
who
has
charged
the
chartering,
branching,
and
merging
in
the
national
banking
system
and
that
the
mergers
are
but
a
small
part
of
--
for
example
the
united
states
last
year,
there
are
35
more
bank
charters
than
there
were
mergers.
in
the
entire
years
of
1965,
only
one
merger
was
attacked
by
the
department
of
justice,
so
that
the
--
the
expertise
of
the
department
in
its
responsible
ability
that
the
effectuation
of
a
national
banking
policy
is
a
function
that
was
given
to
it
by
the
congress,
and
upon
that
rest
of
course
our
constitutional
argument
that
deals
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
there
are
25
--
there
are
more
charters
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
in
1965
than
there
were
mergers.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
banks
have
merged
--
i'm
sorry,
mergers,
mergers.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
mergers,
in
other
words
are
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
there
would
be
300,
no
--
there
would
be
330
banks
involved
in
mergers.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
but
there
would
be
165
surviving,
so
only
165
banks
were
merged
out
of
existence.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
there
were
200
and
some
banks
created.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
so
in
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
on
balance
you
would
have
more.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
no,
you
would
have
more.
you
would
have
more.
you
eliminate
165
and
you
create
202.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
discussion
up
to
this
point
has
confused
the
concepts
of
competition
and
convenience
and
needs.
the
argument
of
the
department
of
justice
seems
to
be
predicated
upon
the
equation
of
competition
in
convenience
and
needs,
for
although
the
department
has
conceded
in
argument
that
it
considers
and
has
always
agreed
in
the
courts
below
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
has
resulted
in
different
standards
or
that
it
has
accepted
the
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
what
they
mean
by
the
standards
of
bma
66.
for
example
in
the
crocker-anglo
case
in
california,
subsequent
to
--
that
case
was
tried
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
subsequent
to
the
act's
passage,
the
three-judge
court
in
the
northern
district
held
a
further
hearing
and
invited
all
parties
to
submit
additional
evidence
and
at
that
time
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
intervened
as
a
party
in
accordance
with
the
right
given
to
him
by
the
bank
merger
act.
they
also
--
and
by
the
briefs
--
and
in
its
brief,
the
department
took
the
position,
"it
is
of
course
the
essential
position
of
the
government
that
the
1966
amendment
to
the
bank
merger
act
has
not
resulted
in
any
substantial
change
in
substantive
antitrust
law
or
in
the
standard
used
by
the
courts
in
determining
the
legality
of
bank
mergers."
again
in
the
crocker
case,
the
department
told
the
court
that
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served
is
but
a
reiteration
of
the
failing-company
doctrine
long
recognized
as
an
integral
part
of
subtle
antitrust
laws.
thus
incidentally,
this
position
was
cited
by
the
crocker
court
in
its
opinion
of
october
6
which
remanded
the
cases
to
the
comptroller
for
further
findings,
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
now,
is
not
adopted
by
the
court
in
california.
again
in
the
case
of
u.s.v.
third
national
bank
in
nashville
which
was
filed
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
but
tried
fully
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
that
act,
the
department
again
represented
to
the
court
that
the
standards
probably
codified
the
somewhat
greater
contours
of
the
failing-company
doctrine
which
was
adverted
to
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
opinion.
and
again
in
the
provident
case
which
is
now
before
the
court
and
as
a
statement
of
position
immediately
prior
to
the
dismissal
of
this
action,
the
department
took
the
case
that
--
took
the
position
that
it
was
the
solvency
of
banks
which
was
to
be
weighed
against
the
anticompetitive
effects.
so,
the
department
has
taken
the
position
really
that
the
act
has
done
nothing
but
impose
a
tougher
anticompetitive
standard
upon
banks
or
that
has
codified
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
now
we
are
somewhat
concerned
that
the
representation
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
that
the
department
has
always
conceded
in
the
courts
below
that
the
standards
of
the
new
act
applied
to
bank
mergers
and
litigation
is
nothing
more
than
an
assertion
by
him
that
clayton
7
still
applies
in
full
force
and
effect
for
if
the
bank
merger
act
merely
incorporates
the
standards
of
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
and
the
failing-company
doctrine
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
then
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
on
the
standards
that
he
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes
i
do.
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
position
of
the
department
here
is
that
each
of
the
factors
--
and
this
is
the
way
i
understood
the
argument,
that
each
of
the
factors
which
might
be
decided
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
under
the
convenience
and
needs
portion
of
this
statute
are
only
those
factors
which
somehow
or
another
relate
to
competition.
and
therefore
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
well,
i
believe
you're
--
we're
talking
about
a
different
aspect
here
mr.
justice
black.
i
believe
that
the
department
has
taken
the
position
that
the
--
there
is
no
basic
difference
between
convenience
and
needs
and
competition
that
each
of
the
convenience
and
needs
facts
or
determinations
by
the
comptroller,
only
those
to
competition,
whether
or
not
it's
probably
pro-competition.
so
in
effect
they
are
turning
the
terms
of
this
act
and
to
--
direction
to
the
comptroller
or
the
banking
agency
to
weigh
the
anticompetitive
effect
of
a
merger
against
the
pro-competitive
effect
of
a
merger.
now,
this
of
course
is
negated
by
the
terms
of
the
act
itself
where
section
4
of
the
act
specifically
is
the
banking
agency,
the
right
to
approve
a
merger
involving
a
bank
that
is
in
danger
of
failing
without
asking
the
department
of
justice
for
an
advisory
report.
as
the
banking
agencies
are
required
to
ask
in
a
case
with
a
bank
that
it's
solving,
or
whether
it
might
be
substantial,
anticompetitive
effects.
there
is
no
point
in
congress
having
asked
an
act
which
does
nothing
more
than
codify
the
failing-company
doctrine
in
the
an
--
in
antitrust
law
because
nobody
has
ever
challenged
the
failing-company
doctrine.
and
this
goes
directly
to
the
constitutional
issue
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
authorization
of
a
merger
by
a
banking
agency
is
a
function
that
under
this
act
is
delegated
directly
to
that
agency
by
the
congress.
and
it
is
definitely
a
legislative
act
being
performed
by
the
comptroller
or
the
banking
agency
involved.
convenience
and
needs
means
nothing
more
than
competition,
then
obviously
the
courts
have
always
been
considered
competent
to
assess
competitive
effects
and
it's
properly
a
judicial
function.
but
the
court
is
not
allowed
and
cannot
be
granted
the
power
by
congress
to
go
around
chartering
banks,
authorizing
branches
for
banks
or
to
approve
mergers
by
banks
is
very
definitely
a
legislative
function
they
cannot
be
constitutionally
delegated
to
a
district
court.
now,
convenience
and
needs
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
well,
as
i
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
don't
believe
so
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
department
arrest
--
the
department
relies
mr.
justice
fortas
upon
several
cases
in
which
the
court
has
apparently
done
that,
the
california,
the
ftc,
the
el
paso
case,
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
and
i
believe
there's
another
one,
the
rca
case.
and
yet
in
the
california
case,
this
court
in
writing
its
opinion
pointed
out
that
in
all
of
these
cases
that
the
department
is
relying
upon,
there
was
no
permissive
legislative
scheme
by
which
the
agency
was
required
to
balance
antitrust
considerations
against
the
public
convenience
and
needs.
in
those
cases
where
the
statute
does
require
that,
this
court
has
in
effect
upheld
the
agency
on
review.
i
might
cite
the
seaboard
case
for
one,
and
the
panagra
case
for
another.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
he
decided
on
both,
mr.
justice
fortas,
he
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
decided
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
he
decided
first
that
there
was
no
substantial
anticompetitive
effect
under
the
terms
of
the
new
statute
which
according
to
the
legislative
history,
we
believe,
permits,
and
requires
the
courts
to
take
into
consideration
all
the
financial
institutions
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
rather
than
just
a
(voice

--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i'm
not
sure
he
states
that,
not
many
words
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
last
paragraph
of
his
opinion
which
appears
on
page
112
b
of
the
appendix
of
the
philadelphia
bank
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
but,
pursuant
to
the
1966
amendment
to
the
bank
merger
act,
we
find
that
the
merger
of
provident
--
that
provident
national
bank
and
central
penn
national
bank
clearly
conforms
to
the
statutory
criteria
and
is
in
the
public
interest
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
which
is
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
correct.
that's
correct
your
honor
and
in
--
that
prior
to
--
the
body
of
the
opinion
--
there's
a
thorough
analysis
of
the
competitive
effects
of
this
particular
merger
and
the
discussion
of
the
benefits
to
the
community.
although
he
didn't
come
out
in
the
--
and
used
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
must
be
inferred
that
in
making
his
determination
in
the
final
paragraph
of
this
opinion
that
he
conformed
to
the
statutory
language.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
know
something
about
it
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
that
is
correct
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
of
course
comptroller
saxon
was
the
comptroller
at
the
time
that
it
was
issued
and
the
supplementary
opinion
was
given
to
the
court
as
the
opinion
of
the
new
comptroller
because
of
the
change
in
comptroller.
that
was
solely
it.
i
don't
think
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
new
comptroller
to
wish
an
opinion
at
all
but
he
felt
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
have
his
views.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes,
and
in
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
in
this
case,
it
says
that
there
are
no
substantial
anticompetitive
effects.
but
that
--
but
regardless
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
might
note
that
they
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
might
note
that
in
arriving
at
the
decision
in
the
houston
case,
the
comptroller
may
have
been
influenced
by
the
decision
in
the
crocker-anglo
case
in
which
the
court
directed
the
comptroller
to
reach
new
findings
under
the
bank
merger
act
and
that
if
he
determine
there
was
no
substantial
anticompetitive
effect,
then
he
was
to
hypothesize
an
anticompetitive
effect
and
advise
the
court
what
his
findings
would
be
in
that
case
upon
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
so
that
could
well
have
been
the
source
of
the
--
that
language.
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes
sir,
of
course
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
judicially
competent?
no.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes.
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
position
because
the
determination
of
convenience
and
needs,
the
determination
of
convenience
and
needs
is
legislative
function
especially
when
it
comes
to
authorizing
something
in
the
future,
a
new
rule
which
in
this
case
is
a
merger
which
creates
an
effect
in
no
institution.
this
is
a
legislative
function
that
cannot
be
delegated
to
the
judiciary.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
it
can
be
because
the
comptroller
is
an
administrative
officer
and
it's
historically
true
that
the
congress
or
a
legislature
can
delegate
any
part
of
its
functions
to
an
administrator.
for
example
--
i
don't
think
anyone
would
deny
that
the
congress
(inaudible)
have
the
right
to
charter
a
bank
and
have
a
new
act
for
each
charter
or
that
it
could
approve
a
merger
and
have
a
new
act
for
each
merger.
but
this
of
course
would
impose
an
insurmountable
burden
upon
the
congress,
so
it
turns
the
duties
over
to
an
administrator.
they
cannot
turn
them
over
to
a
constitutional
court
which
has
a
judicial
function.
now
the
assessment
of
competition
is
certainly
within
the
court's
competence.
but
not
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
court
can
review
--
the
court
can
in
effect
arrive
on
its
own
determination
as
to
competition
in
the
competitive
effect.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
you
can
find
--
under
the
concept
of
review
de
novo,
and
i
might
indicate
mr.
justice
black
and
the
court,
that
the
review
de
novo
was
suggested
originally
in
conferences
between
the
government
agencies
involved
here.
and
it
appears
first
in
the
record
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
it
was
--
appears
first
in
the
record
in
the
january
5th
letter
of
the
attorney
general,
not
in
the
letter
itself
but
in
a
draft
proposal
of
legislation
--
bank
merger
legislation,
but
the
term
review
de
novo
appears
in
that
draft
proposal
and
would
be
--
it
would
be
accurate
to
say
that
that
would
give
the
courts
competence
to
review
the
proposal,
but
the
proposal
may
be
solely
determining
the
legality
of
a
bank
merger,
the
competitive
effect
and
it
included
standards
such
as
convenience
and
needs
only
insofar
as
a
effective
competition.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
in
this
--
with
the
act
as
it
now
stands?
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes,
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
court
may
assess
the
competitive
factors
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
substitute
its
own
opinion
there.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
they
can
review
the
findings
of
the
comptroller.
and
if
it
finds
that
those
--
if
it
finds,
that
the
findings
of
the
comptroller
have
substantial
evidence
behind
them,
if
the
record
has
been
developed
properly,
that
it
must
let
them
stand.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
if
there
has
been
no
hearing
and
insufficient
record,
then
it
must
find
that
the
comptroller
was
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
well,
the
courts
have
done
that.
they
did
this
in
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
in
effect,
yes
if
there
is
not
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
if
there
is
an
insufficient
record,
for
example
no
hearing,
the
court
in
crocker
for
example
was
unwilling
to
--
had
remanded
the
case
to
the
comptroller
for
hearings
and
further
specific
findings
of
facts
in
that
case,
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
upon
the
submission
of
these
findings
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
the
court
called
a
new
hearing
and
invited
the
parties
to
submit
any
new
evidence
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
they
had.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
would
say
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
in
effect,
yes.
but
i
would
say
this
however
that
there
have
been
no
hearings
in
these
cases
and
relying
upon
--
if
the
record
is
complete
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
would
say
mr.
justice
brennan
that
if
the
record
of
the
comptroller
is
--
shows
substantial
evidence
upon
which
he
base
his
discretion,
then
the
court
has
--
cannot
overrule
it,
the
comptroller's
decision.
now
i'm
trying
to
draw
the
distinction
that
the
lower
courts
have
made
in
cases
where
there
have
been
no
particular
hearings.
in
the
smithfield
case
which
is
a
branch
case
for
example,
the
court
said
that
if
there
is
no
hearing
and
no
formal
record
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
let
me
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
brennan.
you
are
asking
if
in
effect
we
are
following
smithfield
here
whether
it
is
--
no
hearing
that
the
court
can
introduce
new
evidence
or
evidence
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
and
make
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
that
the
smithfield
case
held
that
the
court
could
take
evidence
and
reach
findings
of
fact
--
find
--
have
its
own
findings
of
fact.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
but
if
then,
after
looking
at
these
facts
that
it
had
determined,
it
had
found
that
the
determination
of
the
granting
of
a
branch
blessed
upon
the
discretion
of
the
comptroller,
then
the
court
could
not
overturn
the
discretion.
in
other
words,
the
court
was
finding
out
in
the
absence
of
the
record
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
uphold
the
comptroller
and
that's
pre
--
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
here.
the
court
can
find
out
if
no
evidence
and
no
record
exist,
then
the
court
can
move
in
and
find
out
if
the
--
if
there
is
that
type
of
evidence.
but
if
there's
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
decision
of
the
comptroller
which
may
not
be
formulated
in
a
formal
order
or
formal
record,
then
the
court
can
reach
its
own
findings
of
facts
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
don't
think
there
is
any
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
no,
he
would
not
have,
however
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
except
that
he
has
gone
one
step
further
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
and
in
fact
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
in
a
case
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
no.
i
believe
in
a
case
like
that
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
facts
of
competition
were
found
not
to
be
true,
that
without
making
any
determination
then
as
to
convenience
and
needs.
i
believe
it
could
be
remanded
to
the
comptroller
for
further
findings.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
that
the
exercise
and
the
expertise
and
the
discretion
of
a
banking
agency
or
any
administrative
agency
charged
with
the
administration
of
any
industry
would
not
be
a
fit
subject
or
judgment
by
a
court
except
that
--
as
to
the
extent
that
if
it
don't
have
substantial
evidence
to
back
it
up.
i
might
note
that
in
talking
about
convenience
and
needs
citing
a
--
in
the
case
of
bank
of
italy
v.
johnson
which
is
251
p.2d
784,
it
discusses
convenience
and
needs
specifically.
it
says
the
phrase
would
seem
to
be
as
difficult
of
definition
as
police
power,
public
convenience
and
necessity,
due
diligence,
or
probable
cause
as
these
expressions
are
used
in
our
law.
the
impossibilities
of
definition
will
not
be
tracked
in
the
least
from
the
necessity
of
understanding
the
task
and
ascertaining
the
fact
in
each
case,
and
it
is
for
the
superintendent
of
bank's
isocracy
and
to
ascertain
them
in
the
exercise
of
his
power.
in
that
exercise,
he
performs
an
executive
or
administrative
function
and
not
a
judicial
one,
and
held
that
the
power
of
the
state
could
not
transfer
a
legislative
or
rather
a
judicial
function
to
a
comptroller.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
he
would
not
have
had
to
get
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
he
is
saying
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
when
one
assesses
the
competitive
effect
of
this
particular
merger.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
but
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
further,
mr.
justice
white,
he
did
state
that
this
did
meet
the
statutory
criteria,
and
was
in
the
public
interest,
and
he
did
consider
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
again
because
of
the
indications
of
the
court,
that
they
wanted
an
alternative
and
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
the
more
substantial
anticompetitive
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
correct
and
he
--
this
gets
on
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
well,
the
competitive
facts
are
fully
discussed
in
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
in
this
case.
every
fact
is
considered
as
lying
--
is
outlined
there
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
and
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
that's
correct.
now
the
--
there
are
several
other
points
here
if
the
court
please.
one
is
that
this
act
was
also
debated
under
the
term
bank
holding
company
amendments
of
1966
some
seven
months
after
this
act
was
passed.
and
it
was
debated
on
the
senate
floor
and
was
opposed
by
senator
hart
who
had
opposed
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
on
the
ground
that
this
act
was,
as
senator
hart
turned
it,
an
unwarranted
weakening
of
the
antitrust
laws.
he
moved
to
strike
the
identical
language
from
the
bank
holding
company
amendments
and
the
senate
reaffirmed
the
language
of
the
bank
merger
act
and
the
implication
that
this
did
not
create
a
tougher
competitive
standard
but
an
entirely
different
standard
for
the
assessment
of
bank
mergers
by
a
vote
of
11
to
64.
the
--
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
brought
up
before
the
question
of
line
of
commerce
and
the
omission
of
the
line
of
commerce.
this
is
not
to
say
that
you
are
going
to
take
in
steamships
and
everything
else
in
assessing
a
bank
merger
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
what
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
what
we
are
saying
in
effect
is
that
it
has
been
expanded
in
this
phrase
as
contained
in
the
report,
house
report.
it
has
been
expanded
to
take
in
the
realities
of
competition.
all
of
those
institution
which
compete
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
i
believe
it
was
eliminated.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
the
effect
is
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
what
we
are
doing
if
we
take
a
look
at
the
antitrust
law,
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
we
are
including
a
lot
of
lines
of
commerce
and
saying
that
you
have
to
affect
the
--
or
judge
the
overall
effect
of
the
merger
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
upon
the
cluster
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
the
cluster
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
much
broader,
much
broader
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
financial
institution.
but
--
i
believe
its
--
many
lines
of
commerce
which
must
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
financial
competition.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
we
have
made
the
argument
that
the
line
of
commerce
here
mr.
justice
white
is
money.
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
(vioce
overlap)
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
further,
we
believe
that
the
court
should
consider
also
that
mergers
and
the
approval
of
mergers
that
its
only
one
function
of
a
banking
agency.
it
must
effectuate
a
national
banking
policy
particularly
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
who
has
charged
the
chartering,
branching,
and
merging
in
the
national
banking
system
and
that
the
mergers
are
but
a
small
part
of
--
for
example
the
united
states
last
year,
there
are
35
more
bank
charters
than
there
were
mergers.
in
the
entire
years
of
1965,
only
one
merger
was
attacked
by
the
department
of
justice,
so
that
the
--
the
expertise
of
the
department
in
its
responsible
ability
that
the
effectuation
of
a
national
banking
policy
is
a
function
that
was
given
to
it
by
the
congress,
and
upon
that
rest
of
course
our
constitutional
argument
that
deals
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
there
are
25
--
there
are
more
charters
--
mr.
joseph
j.
o'malley
--
in
1965
than
there
were
mergers.
mr.

there

have
more.
you
would
have
more.
you
