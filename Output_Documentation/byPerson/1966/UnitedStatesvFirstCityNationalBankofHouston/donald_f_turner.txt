mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
and
the
succeeding
case
are
both
direct
appeals
under
the
expediting
act,
from
judgments,
dismissing
anti-trust
complaints
against
two
bank
mergers,
one
in
houston
and
one
in
philadelphia.
well,
the
cases
are
not
precisely
parallel,
the
main
issues
are
commendable.
both
we
and
the
comptroller's
officer
and
intervenor
have
read
them
together.
and
accordingly,
if
it
is
agreeable
to
the
court,
i
propose
to
present
more
or
less
a
coalesced
main
argument
but
i
shall
of
course
endeavor
to
and
deal
in
this
first
hour
with
specific
issues
raised
by
the
defendant
banks
in
the
houston
case.
these
cases
raised,
we
believe
some
basic
issues
of
interpreting
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
and
before
giving
you
a
brief
background
of
the
events
that
led
up
to
the
two
cases
now
before
you,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
quoted
the
principle
provisions
of
this
statute.
section
18
(c)
(5)
of
the
act,
provides
and
i
quote,
“a
federal
banking
agency
shall
not
approve,
and
i
insert
a
proposed
bank
merger,
whose
effect
in
any
section
of
the
country
may
be
through
substantially
lessen
competition,
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly,
or
which
in
any
other
manner
would
be
in
restraint
of
trade,
unless
it
finds
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.”
subparagraph
seven
provides
that
in
any
antitrust
action
other
than
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
brought
against
a
merger
approved
by
a
federal
banking
agency
and
again
i
quote,
“the
standards
applied
by
the
court
shall
be
identical
with
those
with
the
banking
agencies
are
directed
to
apply,”
by
the
provision
that
i
just
quoted.
and
finally,
and
again
i
quote,
“and
that
in
any
such
action,
the
court
shall
review
de
novo
the
issues
presented.”
now,
let
me
briefly
describe
to
you
a
--
the
background
of
two
cases.
first
city
national
bank
of
houston
and
southern
national
bank,
appellees
here,
applied
as
the
statute
requires
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
for
approval
of
their
proposed
merger
transaction.
the
comptroller
notified
the
other
two
approving
agencies
in
the
department
of
justice
who
submitted
as
the
statute
requires
their
assessment
of
the
competitive
factors
involved.
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
department
of
justice
both
reported
that
competitive
effects
would
be
adverse,
the
department
of
justice
using
the
adjective
seriously.
nevertheless,
the
comptroller
approved
the
merger
in
september
1966,
concluding
that
in
his
opinion
the
effects
of
the
merger
on
competition
will
not
be
adverse
in
the
houston
area
and
that
in
any
event,
any
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed
in
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
houston
community.
thereupon
within
the
30-days
limitation
provided
for
by
statute,
the
department
of
justice
filed
a
complaint,
challenging
the
proposed
merger
on
the
ground
that
it
might
substantially
lessen
violation
--
lessen
competition
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
the
facts
that
was
relied
on
among
others
and
i
will
be
very
sketchy
on
this
were
that
the
acquiring
bank
was
the
largest
bank
in
houston,
the
houston
area,
accounting
together
with
its
affiliates
were
approximately
29.6%
of
all
commercial
deposits
in
harris
county,
that
the
acquired
bank
was
the
6th
largest
commercial
bank
in
harris
county
and
with
affiliates
accounting
for
about
2.8%
of
commercial
deposits.
but
in
addition,
southern
was
the
fastest
growing
bank
in
--
in
the
city
having
only
been
recently
chartered
and
it
had
a
young
aggressive
management
which
indeed
has
been
cited
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
merger,
it
being
anticipated
that
that
management
will
play
an
active,
if
it
not,
dominant
role
in
the
merge
institution.
within
a
week
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
comptroller
intervened
and
next
day
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
facts,
sufficient
to
support
a
cause
of
action.
defendant
banks
thereupon
filed
a
motion
for
dissolution
of
the
statutory
stay
on
the
ground,
and
i
quote,
“the
plaintiff
has
made
no
allegation
challenging
the
findings
and
determinations
of
the
comptroller
than
any
--
that
any
anticompetitive
effects
resulting
from
a
proposed
merger
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
as
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.”
because
plaintiff
refuses
to
meet
its
statutory
burdens,
said
the
motion,
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
it
will
prevail
on
the
merits.
subsequently
at
the
hearing
on
december
2nd
the
district
court
ruled
as
we
understand
it
and
as
i
have
been
informed
by
counsel
for
the
comptroller
that
they
understand
it,
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
requires
the
government
to
plead
and
assume
the
burden
of
proving
not
only
that
the
merger
is
anticompetitive
but
also
that
the
competitive
injury
is
not
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
we
understand
that
it
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
view
of
the
court
was
that
under
the
bank
merger
act
--
after
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
the
government
must
plead
and
assumes
the
burden
of
proving
not
only
anticompetitive
consequences
which
would
normally
warrant
a
conclusion
that
section
7
has
been
violated,
but
was
also
proved
that
those
anticompetitive
consequences
are
not
clearly
outweighed
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
by
the
convenience
and
needs.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
they
dispute
this
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
and
i
will
get
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
they
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
would
be
an
issue
which
the
judge
in
the
houston
case
clearly
did
not
reach.
it
was
an
issue
which
we
believe
was
reached
by
judge
clary
in
the
provident
case
and
it
is
an
issue
again
that
we
--
we
shall
have
to
deal
with.
there
is
as
mr.
justice
fortas
suggested,
dispute
between
us
and
the
houston
banks
as
to
the
effects
of
the
district
judge's
ruling.
the
houston
banks
take
the
position
that
the
judge
did
not
even
reach
the
burden
of
proof
issue.
that
he
simply
ruled
that
the
government
had
to
allege
facts
from
which
it
could
be
determined
that
the
convenience
and
needs
did
not
outweigh.
and
as
i
indicated
i
will
--
i
will
take
up
that
question.
now,
on
the
basis
of
what
we
understood
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
to
be,
he
--
he
entered
his
order
and
gave
us
10
days
to
amend
our
complaint
to
comply
with
what
he
had
indicated
on
the
basis
of
our
understanding
of
what
his
ruling
was.
we
declined
to
amend
believing
that
the
issue
is
so
important
and
one
so
deserving
of
early
determination,
final
determination
that
it
should
be
taken
up
fast
and
accordingly
the
complaint
was
dismissed
and
we
brought
this
appeal.
now,
the
provident
case,
again
at
the
proposed
merging
banks,
provident
national
and
central
penn
made
their
application
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
for
approval
of
their
merger.
again,
both
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
department
of
justice
indicated
their
view
in
their
reports
on
competitive
factors
that
there
would
be
significant
adverse
competitive
effects.
again,
the
comptroller
approved
the
merger
including
that
rather
than
having
an
overall
adverse
effect
on
competition
and
i'm
quoting,
“it
will
have
a
favorable
effect
further
the
increased
ability
of
the
resulting
bank
to
serve
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
philadelphia
area
by
increased
deficiency
and
the
like
makes
this
merger
desirable.”
accordingly
the
--
again,
within
30
days
the
justice
department
filed
a
complaint
alleging
that
the
violation
violate
--
that
the
merger
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
very
briefly
the
facts
are
that
provident,
the
acquiring
bank
is
the
5th
largest
bank
in
the
four-county
philadelphia
area
accounting
for
9%
of
the
area's
bank
deposits.
central
penn,
the
proposed
acquired
bank
is
the
6th
largest
accounting
for
approximately
5%
of
the
deposits,
the
five
largest
banks
in
the
area
already
accounted
for
some
71%
deposits.
from
here
on
the
procedural
course
of
this
case
was
slightly
different,
the
comptroller
who
again
intervened
as
a
party
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
august
11th.
the
defendants
also
moved
to
dismiss.
they
argued
in
effect
that
the
government
was
unwilling
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
merger
was
not
justified
by
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
but
here,
the
district
court
initially
denied
these
motions
on
the
ground
that
the
action
was
then
only
at
the
notice
pleading
stage
and
the
complaint
was
adequate
to
apprise
the
other
parties
that
the
government
believed
the
merger
unlawful
under
the
clayton
act
as
modified
by
the
bank
merger
act.
however,
shortly
thereafter
on
november
4th,
the
district
court
ruled
that
in
order
to
prove
that
the
merger
was
unlawful,
the
government
would
be
required
to
show
both
of
the
merger
would
have
substantial
anticompetitive
effects
and
that
these
anticompetitive
effects
are
not
clearly
outweighed
by
convenience
and
needs.
the
court
then
went
further
and
indicated
that
it
would
give
great
weight
to
the
findings
of
the
comptrollers
stating
that
if
it
appears
that
the
decision
of
the
comptroller
is
dependent
upon
an
exercise
of
discretion,
the
court
will
vow
to
that
discretion
and
i
close
--
quote,
“unless
the
comptroller
abused,
exceeded,
or
arbitrarily
applied
it.”
now
then,
the
government
subsequently
indicated
by
various
filings
that
it
was
unwilling
to
assume
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
convenience
and
needs
issue.
accordingly,
the
banks
and
comptroller
again
moved
for
final
judgment
dismissing
the
complaint
and
these
motions
were
granted,
and
the
government
duly
appealed.
now,
in
both
of
the
--
there's
a
--
in
both
of
the
cases,
the
respective
district
courts
then
dissolved
the
statutory
stay
provided
for
in
the
bank
merge
act
of
1966,
stays
however
were
subsequently
obtained
in
this
court.
now,
before
proceeding
to
define
what
i
think
the
issues
are,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
indicated
to
you
what
is
not
in
dispute
here.
we
do
not
and
did
not
below
dispute
that
the
bank
merger
act
specifies
the
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
district
court
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
brought
against
bank
mergers
or
that
the
standards
are
presumably
different
to
some
extent
from
the
clayton
act
which
would
normally
apply.
the
government
in
no
way
has
intended
to
dispute
this
by
drafting
its
complaints
in
terms
of
section
7
only.
if
any
court
had
merely
requested
us
to
amend
their
complaints
to
make
reference
to
the
bank
merger
act,
we
would
have
done
so
even
we
thought
--
even
though
we
thought
it
was
unwarranted
for
reason
i
will
shortly
disclose
rather
than
take
so
narrow
an
issue
up
on
appeal.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
the
reason
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
again
i
--
and
i
hope
that
this
is
not
a
technical
response.
i
--
the
--
the
bank
merger
act
itself
creates
no
cause
of
action.
it
itself
sets
forth
--
sets
up
no
judicial
proceeding.
all
the
bank
merger
act
--
act
says
is
and
it
says
repeatedly
throughout
the
various
subsections
that
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
that
may
be
brought,
the
court
shall
apply
these
standards,
shall
review
de
novo
and
so
on.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
quote
--
the
statute
appears
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
page
70,
“any
action
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
arising
out
of
the
merger
transaction.”
in
any
such
action
that's
the
last
sentence.
the
court
shall
review
it
de
novo.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
then
in
the
next
subparagraph,
“in
any
judicial
proceeding,
attacking
a
merger
transaction
on
the
ground
that
in
and
of
itself
had
violated
any
of
the
antitrust
laws.”
so,
that
raise
judicial
proceeding,
again,
refers
to
the
antitrust
laws.
the
standards
applied
by
the
court
and
so
forth.
and
then
over
on
pa
ge
71,
subparagraph
(d),
“in
any
action
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws.”
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
there
would
be
--
here,
i
assume,
to
the
extent
relevant
and
there
will
undoubtedly
be
in
the
future.
many
arguments
between
the
government
and
any
prospective
defendants
as
to
what
the
significance
or
substance
of
those
changes
are.
but
we
can
--
we
have
always
agreed
that
the
bank
merger
act
as
it
clearly
says,
“sets
out
its
standards
which
are
applicable,
the
antitrust
proceedings
attacking
vague
grounds.”
now,
i
take
it,
(inaudible)
--
a
couple
of
things
i
don't
think
we're
in
dispute,
i
take
it
that
opposing
counsel
would
agree
that
the
complaints
of
the
government
stated
a
cause
of
action
insofar
as
the
clayton
act
is
concern,
and
insofar
as
the
an
--
as
anticompetitive
consequences
alluded
to
in
the
bank
merger
act
standard
are
concern.
i
doubt
that
they
would
agree
that
they
clearly
establish
a
clayton
act
violation,
but
i'm
sure
they
would
agree
in
light
of
von's
grocery,
pabst,
and
other
decisions
that
the
alleged
facts
have
--
at
least
gave
the
government
a
fighting
chance.
now,
given
--
endeavoring
to
get
these
issues
out
of
the
way,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
following
four
questions
are
presented
here,
all
of
which
are
great
importance
and
are
threshold
questions
insofar
as
the
bank
merger
act
is
concern.
first,
both
cases
we
believe
present
the
question
whether
once
the
government
in
an
antitrust
suit
challenging
a
bank
merger
establishes
that
the
merger
may
substantially
lessen
competition
defendants
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
merger's
anticompetitive
effects
are
clearly
outweighed
in
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
convenience
and
needs.
that's
the
first
issue.
now,
second,
and
a
related
issue
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
court.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
this
is
in
an
antitrust
proceeding
which
we
have
--
we
have
brought,
pursuant
to
the
antitrust
laws
and
indeed
the
--
the
continuing
validity
which
is
recognized
under
the
act.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
question
is
now,
who
has
--
what
is
the
disposition
of
burden
of
proof?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
can
put
it
another
way
by
saying
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
does
the
--
well,
that's
--
that's
the
second
issue
actually.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
let
me
put
it
this
way,
that
in
deciding
what
the
disposition
of
the
burden
of
proof
is,
it
must
meet
--
you
must
necessarily
face
what
i
would
call
i
second
question
and
the
ones
that
--
squarely
raised
by
provident
and
argued
almost
exclusively
by
the
banks
there
namely,
whether
the
statute
really
incorporates
a
review
standard.
the
kind
of
standard
appropriate
for
the
review
of
action
of
administrative
agencies
and
does
not
continue
in
effect
what
used
to
be
namely
that
the
court
itself
would
make
an
independent
determination
of
the
issues
presented?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
–
that's
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
i
quite
agree
that
you
can't
really
answer
burden
of
proof
issue
satisfactorily
without
getting
to
the
--
to
the
other
question
as
well
and
that
indeed
is
the
second
question.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
if
--
if
it
were
so
that
the
--
that
the
purpose
--
the
words
of
statute
and
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
turn
the
district
court
in
an
antitrust
proceeding
into
a
review
court,
clearly
our
complaints
are
defective.
we
would
have
to
plead
much
differently
than
the
way
we
pled
there.
we
would
plead
i
supposed
along
the
line
that
the
determination
of
the
comptroller
was
arbitrary
capricious
without
foundation
in
law
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
on
--
on
the
record.
and
we
clearly
did
not
plead
that
way.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
and
i
--
to
say
parenthetically
that
the
freedom
to
introduce
additional
evidence
on
part
of
all
parties
i
think
bears
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
review
standard
is
really
contemplated.
now,
the
third
issue
is
the
one
which
the
banks
have
raised
in
the
houston
case
which
is
peculiar
to
their
case
only.
they
claim
that
the
district
court
dismissed
the
houston
case
on
the
pleadings
without
reaching
any
question
of
burden
of
proof
and
that
consequently
their
case
raises
only
the
question
whether
the
department
must,
“alleged
facts
in
its
complaint
establishing
that
the
merger
will
have
anticompetitive
effects
which
are
not
clearly
outweighed.”
now,
i
think
the
final
issue
which
we
have
raised
is
whether
in
the
event
we
prevail
in
the
court
here,
the
statutory
stay
should
be
automatically
restored
on
remand
to
the
district
courts
with
the
parties
of
course
being
free
to
petition
again
for
dissolution
if
they
care
to
do
so.that
is
an
issue
which
clearly
comes
at
the
end.
now
i
would
have
deemed
it
most
appropriate
and
i
think
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
because
--
the
constitutional
issue
mr.
justice
harlan
which
was
raised
by
--
not
only
the
comptroller
but
the
provident
bank
is
tied
up
in
the
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
provides
for
a
review
standard
as
compared
with
the
standard
whereby
the
court
independently
makes
its
determination.
as
the
banks
argue
for
this
result
on
the
basis
that
--
very
briefly
they
claim
that
the
kind
of
job
which
the
bank
merger
act
requires
the
court
to
do
is
so
foreign
to
the
court
that
it
raises
serious
constitutional
questions
and
accordingly
this
court
should
--
should
read
the
act
as
--
as
making
a
review
court
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
district
court.
that
is
--
that
is
subsidiary
to
that
--
that
question.
now
i
would
have
normally
contemplated
taking
up
this
issue
first
because
it
is
clearly
primary
and
clearly
would
dispose
of
all
of
the
questions
that
are
involved
here
and
i
think
also
a
full
exposition
of
this
is
very
helpful
in
understanding
the
rest
of
the
issue
but
in
view
of
the
time
available
and
in
order
to
make
sure
that
i
do
get
to
this
in
fairness
to
defendant
banks
in
the
houston
case,
i
think
i
will
go
to
that
--
to
that
issue,
the
issue
which
is
peculiar
to
that
case
first.
now,
as
i
said
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
the
pleading
question.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
as
the
banks
contend
that
all
the
district
court
held
was
that
we
--
we
should
have
alleged
facts
pertaining
to
convenience
and
need,
and
did
not
reach
the
question
of
who
had
the
burden
of
proof.
now,
as
i've
already
indicated
that
was
not
our
understanding
and
it
is
not
the
understanding
of
the
comptroller
who
made
the
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
granted
by
the
court,
and
i
would
agree
that
the
question
is
not
entirely
free
from
doubt.
the
citations
to
the
record
made
by
the
houston
banks
cast
at
least
some
doubt,
but
i
would
refer
to
a
portion
of
the
transcript
which
they
do
not
refer
to
as
--
as
indicating
the
foundation
for
our
own
view
that
the
judge
was
in
fact
disposing
of
the
burden
issue.
this
is
on
page
3a
of
the
appellee
banks
brief,
the
appendix
to
their
brief.
the
court,
i
am
of
the
view
in
the
light
of
this
few
authorities
which
we
have
--
have
at
this
time
that
the
act
of
1966
made
some
rather
substantial
changes
in
the
law.
i
understand
the
cases,
and
he
was
referring
to
some
other
district
court
decisions,
to
hold
the
burden
to
be
on
the
plaintiff
to
alleged
and
prove
anticompetitive
result
of
this
merger
and
further
that
it
is
not
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
aspect
to
the
matter.
i
think
the
department
of
justice
has
continued
for
reasons
of
its
own
to
adapt
a
contrary
interpretation,
but
i
consider
these
cases
and
i'm
paraphrasing
as
authoritative,
at
least
at
this
time
further
i
think
the
petitions
fails
to
state
a
cause
of
action
in
that
it
alleges
only
the
first
step
and
not
the
second
step
which
is
necessary
for
the
plaintiff
to
support.
now,
as
i
say,
i
--
we
--
we
read
this
and
i
believe
the
comptroller
does
--
is
indicating
that
the
judge
was
in
fact
dismissing
our
complaint
not
only
--
not
merely
for
failure
to
allege
facts
but
on
the
basis
of
a
further
view
that
he
thought
the
burden
proof
on
the
balancing
issue
was
on
us.
but
let
me
--
if
we
assume
that
this
is
all
that
the
court
decided,
our
contention
would
be
that
that
ruling
itself
is
wrong
if
the
government
is
right
on
the
other
major
issues
which
are
before
the
court,
that
is
to
say
if
the
bank
merger
act
contemplates
an
independent
determination
by
the
court
and
if
as
we
urge
the
statute
clearly
sets
forth
convenience
and
needs
as
an
exception
to
a
general
antitrust
standard
and
as
an
exception
the
burden
falls
on
the
defendants
rather
than
on
the
government,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
the
judge's
holding
that
we
should
plead
facts
pertaining
to
--
to
convenience
and
needs
is
just
a
wrong
ruling.
if
the
government
does
not
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
convenience
and
needs
then
it
clearly
state
--
the
complaint
states
a
prima
facie
case
by
alleging
only
anticompetitive
consequences
and
it
is
not
a
defective
complaint.
moreover,
purely
as
a
matter
of
pleading,
a
plaintiff
does
not
normally
have
to
alleged
facts
(inaudible)
and
affirmative
defense.
indeed
there
have
been
some
cases
in
the
past
holding
that
ill-advised
lawyers
who
assert
such
facts
thereby
transfer
the
burden
of
proof
to
themselves.
so
the
short
of
it
is
--
we
believe
that
even
if
the
ruling
made
is
as
narrow
as
the
houston
bank
suggest,
it
is
wrong
if
we
are
right
on
the
issues.
moreover,
and
this
is
my
final
point
on
this
question,
if
the
court's
ruling
was
as
limited
as
the
houston
bank
suggest
and
if
the
narrow
ruling
was
correct
neither
of
which
propositions
we
agree
with,
it
seems
to
us
that
fairness
would
dictate
that
the
case
be
remanded
with
the
directions
that
the
government
be
given
lead
to
amend
and
our
reasons
are
two,
that
if
the
judge
rule
that
way,
it
was
at
best
terribly
unclear
and
if
he
had
been
clear
that
the
government
would
--
would
have
elected
to
amend
rather
than
taking
intermediate
appeal
on
so
narrow
a
point
to
this
court.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
were
--
we
were
given
the
opportunity.
we
did
not
amend
because
we
believed
that
the
judge
had
ruled
to
the
reasons
that
i
have
suggested
namely
that
he
--
he
was
--
he
--
he
was
dismissing
the
complaint
unless
we
amended
it
on
the
basis
of
his
position
that
the
government
not
only
had
to
allege
that
anticompetitive
–-
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
consequences
were
not
clearly
outweighed
but
had
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
why
we
did
not
amend
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
we
did
not
amend
because
the
broad
ruling
is
one
of
such
vital
significance
that
we
thought
it
appropriate
to
take
an
appeal.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
very
briefly,
we
have
before
us
two
cases
involving
bank
mergers
and
dismissal
of
complaints
brought
by
the
government
involving
interpretation
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
and
more
particularly
the
following
provisions.
the
act
provides
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
approve
a
bank
merger,
the
responsible
banking
agency
whose
approval
is
required
shall
not
approve
any
proposed
merger
transaction
whose
effect
in
any
section
of
the
country
may
be
to
substantially
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
or
in
which
in
any
other
manner
would
be
in
restraint
of
trade
unless
it
finds
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
the
statute
further
provides
that
in
any
action
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
challenging
a
merger
which
has
been
approved
by
a
bank
agency,
the
court
shall
review
de
novo
the
issues
presented.
and
it
further
provides
that
in
any
antitrust
proceeding,
the
standards
applied
by
the
court
shall
be
identical
with
those
the
banking
agencies
are
directed
to
apply
under
paragraph
5,
the
paragraph
which
i
just
quoted.
now
yesterday,
i
endeavored
to
discuss
one
issue
raised
by
the
houston
banks
in
their
case,
namely
an
issue
--
a
claim
that
the
dismissal
in
that
case
was
simply
on
the
basis
that
the
government
has
failed
to
allege
facts
concerning
convenience
and
needs
rather
than
on
the
basis
that
the
government
had
failed
to
meet
the
burden
of
proof
on
both
competitive
needs
and
the
competitive
consequences
and
convenience
and
needs.
today
i
want
to
address
myself
to
what
we
deem
to
be
the
two
major
issues
on
the
case
which
are
closely
interrelated.
and
the
first
is
whether
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
contemplates
that
in
an
antitrust
proceeding,
the
function
of
the
court
really
is
to
apply
a
review
standard
to
the
determination
made
by
the
banking
agency,
that
is
to
say
the
kind
of
review
standard
that
would
be
applied,
say
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
the
action
of
the
ordinary
administrative
agency
made
on
the
basis
of
the
full
hearing
and
the
full
record.
second,
assuming
that
this
is
not
so,
that
it
is
the
function
of
the
court
to
make
an
independent
determination
and
come
to
its
own
conclusion
whether
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
to
allege
and
prove
not
only
the
necessary
anticompetitive
consequences
but
also
the
--
a
negative
proposition
that
these
are
not
out
--
not
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
but
whether
on
the
other
hand,
that
is
a
matter
to
be
--
to
be
raised
by
defendants
with
the
burden
lying
on
them.
yes
mr.
justice?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
as
if
we
--
if
it
is
a
review
procedure,
not
only
is
the
burden
on
the
government
to
allege
and
prove
the
negative
proposition
that
i
have
just
suggested
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
probably
considerably
more
than
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
namely
that
the
determination
of
the
agency
either
was
based
on
insubstantial
evidence
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
or
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
justice,
i
--
we
think
it
is,
as
i
think
i
tried
to
indicate
yesterday,
i
--
we
wouldn't
--
we
would
not
have
raised
in
the
serious
objection
if
the
point
you
now
make
was
made
by
the
district
judge
and
he
had
said,
"won't
you
please
amend
your
complaint
to
read
--
say
--
to
charge
a
violation
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966."
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
i'm
afraid
i
lacked
court
experience
but
in
any
event,
if
this
point
have
been
made,
we
would
have
had
no
objection
of
that.
i
think
our
complaints
were
technically
correct
because
the
bank
merger
act
as
i
suggested
yesterday
does
not
itself
create
a
cause
of
action.
the
cause
of
action
is
still
an
antitrust
cause
of
action
and
what
the
bank
merger
act
does
is
as
you've
--
as
you
pointed
out
and
as
we
all
know
is
obvious
indicate
that
in
a
antitrust
action
involving
a
bank
merger,
the
court
shall
apply
the
particular
standard
that
is
set
forth.
now,
i
find
it
little
hard
to
see
why
the
trial
can't
proceed
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
as
the
government
has
drafted
it,
so
long
as
everybody
is
aware
of
the
proposition
that
i've
just
suggested.
i
think
it
makes
a
little
difference
to
us
whether
the
complaint
reads
one
way
or
the
other.
i
don't
think
it's
a
decisive
question
or
one
that
has
any
material
impact
on
the
way
that
the
case
would
be
tried,
nor
does
it
leave
the
defendants
unaware
of
what
the
issues
are.
now
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
question
as
to
whether
this
statute
gives
to
the
antitrust
court
the
task
of
simply
reviewing
the
agency
determination
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
it
was
arbitrary,
capricious
or
not,
or
whether
it
gives
to
the
court
it's
normal
function
in
an
antitrust
case
of
making
an
indeterminate
--
an
independent
determination
of
the
issues
that
are
raised.
now
of
course
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
bank
merger
act
clearly
contemplates
that
the
court
in
many
cross
action
involving
a
bank
merger
shall
make
an
indetermine
--
independent
determination
of
the
legality
of
the
merger
under
the
standards
of
the
act
and
not
merely
review
the
banking
agency's
determination
to
see
if
it
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence
or
it
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
let
me
--
the
sequence
was
this.
trial
de
novo,
it
was
used
in
one
letter
by
the
attorney
general,
a
letter
i
believe
dated
september
24.
the
phrase
review
de
novo
appeared
in
the
proposed
draft
of
a
statutory
provision
laying
down
standards
applicable
to
bank
mergers
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
appearing
in
the
letter
of
january
5th
--
accompanying
a
letter
of
january
5th,
1966.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
we
do
mr.
justice.
the
comptroller's
brief
suggest
some
executive
history
if
i
may
call
it
that,
to
the
effect
that
there
was
some
significance
in
the
change
of
words
from
trial
to
review
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
can
only
say
having
been
a
participant
and
i
would
not
raise
this.
i
don't
want
to
say
to
myself
having
been
a
participant
in
all
of
the
agency
discussions
that
i
do
not
share
their
recollection.
my
recollection
is
that
the
question
never
came
up.
i
think
--
in
short
of
it
is,
our
position
is
that
the
words
are
really
interchangeable.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
there's
no
particular
significance
to
be
attached
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
to
one
or
the
other.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
i
don't.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
that
was
involved
in
the
smithfield
case
which
is
cited
rather
heavily
by
appellees
in
both
of
these
cases
did
not
itself
use
the
phrase
review
de
novo.
it
used
the
word
trial
de
novo.
and
i
must
say
having
read
the
case
that
i
failed
to
see
how
it
supports
the
position
of
the
appellees
argue
that
it
does,
to
me
it's
manifest
from
reading
the
opinion
that
the
court
is
using
the
words
trial
and
review
de
novo
interchangeably.
the
statute
as
i
said
uses
the
word
trial
de
novo,
courts
to
review
and
will
set
aside
the
determination,
it
found
to
be
unwarranted
by
the
facts
to
the
extent
that
the
facts
are
subject
to
trial
de
novo.
that
was
the
statute
the
court
was
interpreting
in
that
case.
and
later
on,
the
court
prior
to
remanding
said,
"we
will
request
the
court
below,
the
district
court
to
review
de
novo
the
action
of
the
comptroller."
as
i
said
it
seems
to
me
that
as
far
as
that
court
was
concerned,
there
was
no
particular
significance
in
using
one
word
or
the
other.
i
must
say
that
the
attorney
general
who
existed
--
a
legislation
which
would
have
removed
antitrust
jurisdiction
to
the
end
would
hardly
calculate
that
they
abused
the
phrase
review
de
novo
in
his
own
proposed
statute,
if
it
had
the
consequences
that
the
appellees
now
contend
that
it
does.
now
--
but
for
the
problem
mr.
justice
brennan
that
you
have
just
raised,
namely
whether
there
is
any
peculiar
significance
in
the
use
of
the
word
review
as
opposed
to
trial,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
words
of
the
statute
clearly
give
to
the
court
the
responsibility
of
making
its
normal
independent
determination
of
the
issues
that
are
presented
in
an
antitrust
case
involving
bank
mergers.
the
only
difference
being
that
the
issues
may
be
somewhat
broader
and
somewhat
different
in
response
to
the
different
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
directs
the
court
to
apply.
we
would
also
suggest
that
this
consequence
is
made
perfectly
clear
by
the
legislative
history
including
most
particularly
the
fact
that
bills
wre
rejected
which
would
have
either
immunized
bank
mergers
once
approved
by
the
banking
agencies
from
antitrust
attack
or
would
have
provided
precisely
the
kind
of
review
that
appellees
now
suggest
the
statute
the
respondent
asked
did.
in
fact,
the
original
bill
proposed
by
senator
robinson,
s.
1698
provided
that
--
it
would
have
provided
that
the
authority
to
approve
mergers
consolidations
and
acquisitions
herein
conferred
on
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
the
board
of
governors,
and
the
court
--
and
fdic
shall
be
exclusive
and
plenary
and
any
banks
participating
in
any
transaction
authorized
or
approved
under
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
be
and
they
are
relieved
from
the
operation
of
antitrust
laws.
that
was
senator
robertson's
original
proposal.
the
original
proposal
by
representative
ashley
in
the
house,
h.r.
11011
would
have
provided
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
precisely
identical
with
the
kind
of
review
say
of
an
ftc,
an
fpc,
or
an
fcc
determination
providing
anybody
including
the
attorney
general
could
go
to
the
court
and
in
that
court,
the
findings
of
the
agency
as
to
the
facts,
if
supported
by
substantial
evidence
shall
be
conclusive
and
all
the
other
usual
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
that
would
have
been
an
interesting
problem
if
that
bill
had
passed.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
--
well,
i
take
it
back.
that
actually
--
bill,
i
think
it
provide
for
a
hearing,
so
that
would
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
have
solved
that
problem.
i'm
not
absolutely
sure
on
that
and
if
i'm
wrong,
i
will
correct
it
later.
my
recollection
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
if
there
--
any
effort
is
made
of
course
in
court
of
appeals
to
produce
new
evidence,
that
must
be
by
way
of
motion,
namely
--
and
the
normal
procedure
would
be
then
to
remand
that
the
court
thought
that
the
new
evidence
was
pertinent
and
should
be
heard,
the
normal
procedure
would
be
to
remand
the
court
--
to
the
agency
itself
to
reopen
the
record
and
reconsiders
determinate
--
the
matter
on
the
basis
of
the
new
evidence.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
ashley
proposal
did,
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
and
that
was
incidentally
the
bill
which
was
most
strongly
criticized
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
first
letter
to
chairman
patman
of
september
24th,
1965.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right
and
--
well,
as
the
attorney
general
pointed
out
in
that
letter,
the
--
there
are
vast
number
of
applications
for
bank
mergers,
they
run
in
the
hundreds.
there
has
not
been
in
the
past
provision
for
hearings
and
this
makes
sense
because
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
are
such
that
--
certainly
insofar
antitrust
considerations
are
involved,
there's
no
problem
that's
going
to
be
presented.
and,
the
enormity
of
the
test
that
would
be
assumed
by
the
banking
agency
is
they
have
full
scale
hearings
on
each
one
of
these
applications
would
be
really
great.
well
--
but
the
point
that
was
made
was,
given
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
abbreviated
disposition
is
appropriate
for
bank
agency
approval.
this
clearly
suggests
that
in
any
judicial
proceeding
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws,
that
that
determination
should
not
get
the
kind
of
weight
that
an
administrative
agency
determination
normally
gets.
and
it
was
suggested
that
--
in
that
letter
and
in
the
later
letter,
although
we
did
not
get
exactly
the
statute
we
wanted,
that
in
terms
of
the
standards
that
the
appropriate
way
of
dealing
with
this
matter
was
the,
why
do
we
think
the
bank
merger
act
finally
did
deal
with
it?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
to
the
determination
mr.
justice
as
such,
it
seems
to
me
none.
to
expertise
on
particular
issues,
i
don't
think
there's
any
single
answer
to
that.
that
is
in
urging
of
this
act
does
not
give
the
court
simply
a
review
function
for
reviewing
the
determination
of
the
comptroller.
we
are
not
urging
for
the
other
banking
agency,
we
are
not
urging
at
all
that
the
expertise
of
those
agencies
to
the
extent
that
it
exist
and
with
regard
to
the
particular
issues
in
which
it's
important
is
going
to
be
disregarded.
they
have,
as
you
know
by
statute,
the
opportunity
to
appear
as
a
party,
an
opportunity
that
has
been
taken
every
time
it
has
been
presented,
whether
they
appear
as
a
party
or
not,
the
banking
agency
official
could
appear
as
a
witness
and
evidence
can
be
put
in.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
--
he
wouldn't
be
entitled,
you
know,
to
the
treatment
of
the
--
that
any
expert
would
(voice
overlap)
be
entitled
to.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
it
would
be
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
again,
i
would
say
that
under
the
procedures
that
are
established
as
properly
interpreted,
the
final
determination
of
the
agency
is
not
entitled
in
anyway.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
the
actual
court
proceeding,
when
particular
issues
came
up
that
may
have
peculiar
aspects
about
them
on
which
the
banking
agency
may
have
expertise,
the
court
may
well
pay
that
rather
high
regard.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
well,
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
factual
statements
as
such,
i
would
suppose,
could
not
be
introduced
as
evidence
and
these
are
more
in
the
nature
of
con
--
fact
conclusions
not
evidence.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
in
the
court
proceeding,
the
facts
that
laid
behind
those
findings
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
would
presumably
have
to
be
adduced.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
well,
whether
they
would
be
admissible
as
evidence,
and
if
so,
for
what
purpose
would
be
a
matter
for
the
ordinary
rules
of
evidence.
if
--
again,
if
they're
conclusory,
they
would
be
open
to
challenge
on
the
basis
of
the
--
on
the
ground
that
the
basic
facts
have
not
have
been
presented.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct,
but
i
would
--
you
know,
in
a
sense,
retrial
is
not
an
appropriate
word
because
in
--
and
a
lot
of
these
issues,
if
not
all,
all
of
them
never
have
been
tried
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
have
never
been
tried
because
of
the
summary
nature
of
the
proceedings
before
the
banking
agency.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
just
two
or
three
points
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
why
it
is
we
think
the
conclusion
we
urge
is
correct.
one
is
this,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
act,
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
act
was
clearly
to
eliminate
the
application
of
disparate
standards
among
the
banking
agencies
and
between
the
baking
agencies
in
the
courts.
it
is
--
or
a
thread
running
through
the
entire
legislative
history
and
the
relevant
reports
is
the
desire
that
there'd
be
uniformity
insofar
as
the
standards
applied
by
the
agencies
and
the
courts
are
concerned.
now,
we
simply
point
out
that
you
cannot
achieve
uniformity,
in
fact
you
clearly
do
not
as
between
court
and
administrative
agencies
if
the
administrative
agencies
are
directed
to
apply
the
standards
that
the
bank
merger
act
sets
forth,
and
the
court
applies
not
those
standards
but
a
review
standard
overturning
the
agency
determination
only
if
it
finds
it
arbitrary
and
capricious.
those
are
not
the
same
standards,
those
are
different
standards.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
i'd
--
i
would
prefer
not
to
tackle
the
other
questions
if
i
--
[laughter]
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
am
simply
contending
a
--
suggesting
that
with
regard
to
this
particular
area,
it
seems
clear
to
us
from
the
legislative
history
that
among
the
things
of
principal
concern
to
congress
was
a
feeling
that
the
standards
of
the
bank
agencies
were
applying
in
approving
or
disapproving
mergers
were
quite
dissimilar
from
those
that
had
been
applied
by
the
courts.
to
be
specific,
i'm
sure
it
was
felt.
indeed,
i
think
it
was
suggested
at
more
than
one
point
that
the
banking
agencies
were
not
applying
the
standard
of
philadelphia
national
bank.
and
what
congress
wanted
to
do
is
to
make
sure
as
best
as
it
could,
that
at
east
they
started
out
trying
to
apply
the
same
standards.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
you
can't
--
that
aim
would
not
be
achieved
if
the
agencies
are
directed
to
apply
particular
standards
and
the
court
simply
applies
the
kind
of
review
that
is
normally
made
for
an
administrative
agency.
moreover
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
oh!
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
i
think
--
i
have
the
committee
report
here
and
it
says
the
major
purpose
of
the
bill
is
to
resolve
the
apparently
conflicting
interpretations
which
have
been
made
--
given
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960.
this
is
the
house
report
to
the
company
declining
the
bill
that
was
passed.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
not
sure
at
this
point
that
i
understand
the
question
maybe
i'd
better
restate
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
there
was
or
thought
to
be
--
there
was
--
or
there
was
or
thought
to
be
by
the
congress
a
difference
in
approach.
and
i
must
say
i
don't
suppose
anybody
really
disputes
that
proposition.
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
bank
merger
act
was
to
--
as
best
as
you
can,
eliminate
that
difference.
and
my
argument
is
that
you
don't
eliminate
it
by
applying
--
by
putting
the
courts
in
the
position
of
applying
a
review
standard.
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there's
not
one
bank
agency
but
three
who
can
take
quite
different
approaches
to
these
questions
as
indeed
these
cases
indicate
and
both
of
these
cases,
the
federal
reserve
board
made
a
different
assessment
of
the
competitive
factors
than
did
the
comptroller.
and
if
the
court's
function
is
limited
simply
to
one
of
reviewing
the
agency
determination
to
see
if
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious,
it
is
impossible
to
bring
the
agencies
into
some
sort
of
line
because
they
could
pursue
substantially
diverse
halves
in
assessing
factors
of
this
kind
and
still
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
will
--
if
i
may
continue
this
argument
a
little
later,
i'd
like
to
save
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
bank
merger
act.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
any
other
--
that's
right.
and
the
issue
i've
not
yet
reached,
but
i
will
do
in
arguing
the
second
case
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
is
whether
that
is
--
i
mean
the
second
case
that
is
here
before
us
now.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
is
whether
that
proposes
any
peculiarly
difficult,
impossible
burdens
on
the
court.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
i'd
like,
as
i
may,
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal
on
this
case.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice
i'm
going
to
utilize
what
time
remains
for
brief
comments
on
points
made
by
mr.
searls
and
i
think
--
i
only
have
two
to
make
and
one
is
in
the
nature
of
a
restatement
of
our
view
on
the
bank
merger
act
and
the
pleadings
in
response
to
the
formulation
of
the
houston
bank's
position
that
developed
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
searls
and
mr.
justice
fortas.
and
in
substance,
our
view
is
simply
that
all
the
bank
merger
act
does
is
to
create
a
defense
like
the
mcguire
act
creates
a
defense
to
a
charge
of
resale
price
maintenance.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
was
my
second
comment.
that
--
but
--
just
to
finish
up
with
this,
we
think
simply
it
creates
another
defense
namely
that
a
merger
otherwise
unlawful
is
not
unlawful
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
are
so
served
but
this
clearly
outweighs
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
sir?
well,
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
our
position
is
--
it
will
be
due
--
i
will
say
it
here
and
we
will
certainly
assert
it
in
any
proceedings
below
in
cases
that
this
omission
is
inadvertent
of
no
particular
consequence.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
don't
think
that
were
saying
--
that
i've
been
saying
two
different
things
here.
first,
as
to
whether
the
omission
of
the
phrase
in
any
line
of
commerce
is
significant,
it
is
indeed
arguable.
it
is
arguable
if
that
indeed
it
was
deliberate
and
significant
and
works
a
significant
change
in
the
standards
to
be
applied,
i
could
possibly
dispute
that.
i
will
hasten
to
the
add
as
i've
said
a
moment
ago
to
the
view
of
the
government
that
this
is
not
so
and
i
might
briefly
indicate
the
reasons
why
it's
inconceivable
to
us
how
you
can
conduct
any
rational
inquiry
as
to
what
the
consequences
of
a
merge
--
bank
merger
is
going
to
be
unless
you
have
some
idea
of
the
lines
of
commerce
affected.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
now
you
can't
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
you
can't
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
mean,
the
--
if
the
proposition
would
be
that
you
should
so
to
speak
and
i
think
the
position
of
the
comptroller
boils
down
to
this,
that
you
should
disregard
plain
economic
common
sense
in
the
definition
of
market
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
and
we
don't
think
that's
appropriate.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
on
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
and
we
do
not
--
that,
i
--
we
do
not
dispute
and
i
don't
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
proposition
i'm
just
suggesting.
we
do
not
dispute
with
the
bank
merger
act
standard
is
applicable
in
a
section
7
proceeding
and
incidentally
we
have
never
disputed
this
below.
i
could
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
oh,
i
didn't
concede,
it's
an
error
of
law.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
i
--
by
my
position
to
restate
it
and
i
--
i'm
sorry
if
i
didn't
make
it
clear,
is
that
bank
merger
act,
to
know
bank
merger
act
is
a
matter
of
pleading,
what
is
involved
is
an
antitrust
case.
that's
what
is
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
referred
to
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
in
the
bank
merger
act
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
to
bring
an
antitrust
proceeding.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
now,
if
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
it
maybe
more
artful
pleading
and
it
may
be
more
appropriate
pleading
to
say
--
to
charge
a
violation
of
section
7
as
amended
by
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
that
is
not
in
--
that
may
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
not
in
so
many
words.
that's
another
reason
why
we
didn't
--
it's
just
simply
as
a
matter
of
pleading.
we
just
saw
a
particular
point
to
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
it's
not
as
clearly
to
say
the
court
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
shall
apply
the
standards
set
forth.
that
we
do
not
dispute.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
made
a
section
7
action.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
that's
right.
i
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
a
merger
case,
the
section
1
sherman
act
charges
redundant
and
we
don't
deal
--
and
that
we
just
don't
use
it
anymore.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
that
completes
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
my
rebuttal
on
this.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
simply
continue
my
discussion
of
the
nature
--
of
what
we
view
to
be
the
nature
issues
in
this
case
only
briefly
restating
before
i
proceed
our
principal
--
the
principal
arguments
i
have
covered
as
to
why
we
believe
under
the
bank
merger
act
the
court
is
still
as
in
any
antitrust
case
required
to
make
an
independent
determination
and
i
will
simply,
briefly
summarize
the
points
we
think
the
statute
is
clear
in
a
way
that
it
reads,
it
provides
that
the
court
shall
apply
the
identical
standards
which
the
agency
is
directed
to
apply,
and
clearly
a
review
standard
would
not
be
an
identical
standard.
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
review
de
novo
of
the
issues
presented,
not
the
determination
made
by
the
banking
agency.
finally,
it's
clear
enough
to
all
that
the
review
standard
would
amount
to
an
outright
repeal
of
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
bank
mergers
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
--
repeals
by
implication
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
likely
to
be
implied.
and
we
think
certainly
a
repeal
should
not
be
implied
where
as
noted
in
this
court's
opinion
in
philadelphia
bank,
direct
regulation
of
the
banking
industry
does
not
extend
that
the
prices
charged
for
banking
services
and
were
accordingly
the
maintenance
of
competition
is
highly
important
for
reasons
also
stated
in
philadelphia
bank
opinion
which
we
think
are
completely
valid
competition
in
fact
may
even
be
more
important
in
this
industry
than
in
others
because
of
it's
effects
upon
entry
in
other
businesses.
and
certainly
finally
repeal
should
not
be
implied
or
presumptive
weight
given
to
an
immunizing
decision
that
is
based
not
on
a
full
scale
administrative
adversary
hearing
with
full
opportunity
for
cross-examination
of
witnesses
and
other
presentation
of
evidence
were
on
the
kind
of
summary
proceeding
that
is
involved
here.
and
very
briefly
again
with
regard
to
the
legislative
history,
we
simply
point
to
the
fact
that
several
bills
which
would
have
done
what
the
appellee's
laim
was
done
here
were
rejected
by
congress
and
the
bill
that
you
have
before
you
was
passed.
now
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
one
bill
would
have
mr.
justice
black.
the
original
bill
filed
was
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
he
may
speak
for
himself.
i'm
quite
sure
that
he
would've
been
delighted
with
such
a
solution.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
again,
i'm
not
fully
familiar
your
honor
with
all
of
the
statements
that
the
comptroller
has
made
but
i
think
it
is
a
fair
representation
that
is
viewed
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
that
indeed
he
would
have
favored
legislation
which
would
have
eliminated
the
right
of
the
department
of
justice
to
obtain
in
the
court
antitrust
proceeding
and
independent
determination
of
validity
of
a
merger.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
this
would
would've
been
provided
for
by
the
original
bill
filed
by
senator
robertson.
robertson
s.
1698
would
have
immunized
from
the
operation
the
antitrust
laws
determinations
made
by
the
banking
agencies.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
there
were
no
differences
ironed
out
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
bill
that
finally
passed
to
the
house
was
submitted
to
the
senate
and
passed
to
--
the
best
of
my
recollection,
without
change
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
as
a
substitute
to
the
senate
bill.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
now
incidentally,
there's
one
aspect
of
the
legislative
history
which
--
which
none
of
us
have
brought
out
and
that
is
another
purpose
of
the
legislation
and
at
least
some
of
the
esteem
behind
it,
was
a
desire
to
eliminate
divestiture
in
three
bank
cases
that
the
government
had
won.
and
in
fact
the
bill
that
passed
the
senate
was
a
bill
that
did
nothing
else
but
that.
it
had
no
impact
on
substantive
rules
and
antitrust
proceedings
in
future
cases
at
all.
it
would
have
provided
a
30-day
limitation,
but
insofar
as
substantive
rules
were
concerned,
the
bill
that
first
passed
the
senate
would
have
simply
immunized
pending
cases.
and
then
after
the
rather
tortured
progress
of
this
through
the
house,
the
bill
was
--
we
finally
see
was
passed
by
the
house
and
was
substituted
in
the
senate
and
there
was
no
further
--
there
were
no
further
changes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
was,
that
language
is
precisely
the
language
that
the
attorney
general
proposed
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
in
his
letter.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
understand
that
to
mean,
your
honor,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
it
means
that
once
an
antitrust
case
is
filed
attacking
a
bank
merger,
that
all
of
the
relevant
issues
that
are
raised
under
the
appropriate
standards
are
to
be
tried
the
way
--
the
court
de
novo
and
the
determination,
the
final
conclusion,
the
final
determination
made
by
the
banking
agency
is
not
of
itself
to
be
given
presumptive
weight.
that's
what
we
understand
that
to
mean.
now,
as
i
indicated
in
a
response
earlier
to
a
comment
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
are
not
by
any
means
denying
that
the
banking
agencies
have
expertise
which
--
in
such
court
proceeding
may
on
one
or
several
issues
get
a
considerable
amount
of
weight,
depending
on
the
persuasive
quality
of
the
presentation
on
the
nature
of
the
issue.
let
me
give
a
specific
example
on
which
i
think
this
would
probably
be
likely
to
occur
or
the
banking
agencies
have
indeed
a
long
time
experience
with
problems
of
bank
failure
and
imminent
bank
failure.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
experience,
their
judgment
as
to
whether
certain
factual
indication
suggests
the
likelihood
or
the
danger
of
bank
failure
would
i
suppose
be
entitled
to
be
listened
to
with
considerable
respect.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
in
the
abstract
mr.
justice
brennan
really
say
how
expertise
would
play
a
role
there.
now,
one
of
the
disputes
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
the
houston
case,
it's
sort
of
a
reverse
twist.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
normally
the
larger
bank
in
acquiring
the
smaller
bank,
the
argument
is
that
the
smaller
bank's
management
has
become
mediocre
and
did
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
other
way
around
in
the
houston
case.
but
this
is
a
factor
commonly
relied
on.
now,
this
incidentally
is
an
issue
of
substance
on
which
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
i
am
sure
that
we
and
the
banking
agencies
are
rather
going
to
--
are
going
to
rather
sharply
conflict
because
an
issue
we
will
always
raise
against
the
claim
of
that
kind
is
whether
the
merger
is
necessary
to
resolve
the
management
problem
that
has
been
relied
upon
by
the
comptroller.
there
are
other
ways
of
solving
management
problems,
and
we
think
it's
quite
appropriate
and
we'll
argue
in
any
proceeding
that
there
must
be
some
demonstration
that
there
was
no
other
solution
at
hand
which
was
likely
to
take
care
of
this.
but
this
again,
i
don't
want
to
argue
issues
of
this
kind.
i
think
it's
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
this
really
takes
me
into
the
--
into
what
i
think
is
the
heart
of
the
issue.
i
mean,
the
basic
claim
that
is
being
made
exclusively
by
the
appellees
now
in
the
provident
case
or
by
the
comptroller's
office
is
that
what
is
involved
here
are
issues
which
are
just
not
suitable
for
determination
by
the
court.
now
i
think
really
the
argument
breaks
down
into
two
parts,
first
that
the
banking
agencies
have
greater
expertise
in
assessing
the
various
factual
issues
that
might
come
up
under
the
bank
merger
act
standard.
and
second
on
an
issue
i
think
should
be
kept
apart
and
i
certainly
will
discuss
it
but
i
want
to
set
it
aside
for
a
moment
that
the
balancing
of
competitive
considerations
against
convenience
and
needs
is
a
balancing
of
interest
that
is
somehow
ill-suited
to
court
determination.
now,
of
course,
we
see
no
force
in
either
of
these
contentions.
now,
with
regards
to
the
expertise
on
factual
issues,
i
think
in
view
of
what
the
statute
clearly
provides
in
our
view
and
what
the
legislative
history
indicates,
namely
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
congress,
that
the
court
shall
continue
to
exercise
their
functions
and
carry
on
an
independent
proceeding
here
and
make
an
independent
determination
that
it
will
not
do
simply
to
maintain
that
there
is
some
greater
expertise
on
the
--
in
part
of
the
agencies
that
has
to
be
shown
that
there's
some
reason
to
believe,
the
court
simply
cannot
handle
these
issues
and
we
do
not
think
that
is
so.
now,
let
me
just
go
into
some
of
the
issues
that
may
be
raised,
we
believe
that
most
if
not
all
of
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
thank
you.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
again
briefly
recapitulate,
i'm
now
taking
up
the
question
whether
the
courts
are
so
incapacitated
for
dealing
with
the
kinds
of
issues
that
are
involved
in
proceedings
of
this
kind
that
despite
what
we
think
is
the
plain
meaning
of
a
statute
and
the
plain
implication
of
legislative
history,
this
court
should
read
in
a
review
standard
of
some
kind
and
needless
to
say
we
think
the
courts
clearly
are
not.
there
are,
as
i
suggested
really
two
issues
here
or
it
breaks
down
into
two
parts.
one,
whether
the
banking
agencies
have
a
greater
expertise
or
--
let
me
put
it
differently,
whether
the
courts
lack
expertise
in
assessing
the
various
factual
issues
that
might
come
up.
and
second,
whether
the
balancing
of
considerations
that
might
be
involved
under
the
bank
merger
act
statute
is
so
wholly
unsuited
to
courts
that
to
impose
it
on
them
would
raise
something
akin
to
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
would
--
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
answer
that
in
general
without
reference
to
particulars.
i
don't
--
and
i
also
must
myself
confess
considerable
amount
of
ignorance
on
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
think
it
would
be
admissible
at
least
certainly
if
they
call
these
people
to
testify
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
which
they
would
probably
do,
would
they?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
it
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
answer
that
question
precisely.
i
think
substantially
the
answer
is
yes,
or
put
it
this
way,
the
what
--
the
way
you
put
the
position
is
substantially
correct.
i
think
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
has
no
impact
or
would
have
no
impact.
let
me
suppose
for
example
that
the
facts
brought
out
in
the
judicial
proceeding
more
or
less
correspond
to
those
that
were
developed
by
the
comptroller
and
were
a
part
of
his
record.
and
let
us
further
suppose
that
on
some
of
those
issues,
some
of
those
factual
questions
say
for
example,
on
the
likelihood
of
bank
failure
or
risk
of
bank
failure,
his
expertise
would
deserve
considerable
recognition.
then
i
can
envisage
a
situation
in
which
--
if
the
court
was
so
to
speak
on
the
race
(inaudible),
it
more
or
less,
the
facts
were
not
reasonably
in
dispute
and
the
judgment
of
the
comptroller
was
that
the
acquired
bank
was
going
to
fail,
the
judge
might
go
he
himself
would
not
--
might
have
some
doubt
on
this,
would
pay
some
regard
to
this.
but
i
think
in
short,
that
the
role
of
the
expertise
of
the
banking
agency
would
apply
is
not
something
that
can
be
answered
generally.
i
think
it
cannot
be
answered
easily
out
of
the
context
of
the
specific
issues
that
any
particular
case
raises.
and
to
go
back
to
your
question
again,
just
as
you're
saying,
is
it
generally
so
that
the
conclusion
of
the
comptroller
as
such
would
not
be
entitled
away,
i
think
i
would
again
be
inclined
to
say
yes,
that
is
our
position.
i
don't
see
how
--
i
think
it
is
that
it
derives
from
our
position
really
that
what
is
involved
here
is
an
independent
determination
by
the
courts
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
now,
to
get
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
the
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
which
--
and
again,
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
again,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
cripple
with
my
friends
on
the
other
side.
this
position
is
the
position
the
government
has
consistently
taken
below.
let
me
just
quote
briefly
from
our
brief
in
houston,
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
quote
page
8
of
the
brief,
"plaintiff
does
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
1966
act
has
no
relevance
in
this
lawsuit
or
has
no
way
affected
the
fair
existing
law.
the
66
act
affects
prior
law
in
two
ways.
one,
it
sets
forth
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
banking
agencies.
and
two,
directs
that
the
court
apply
those
same
standards.
now
i
have
further
citations
from
our
briefs
and
filings
in
both
courts
below
but
the
chart
of
it
is
we
--
well,
our
position
is
that
what
the
bank
merger
act
has
done
has
modified
and
supplied
a
new
set
of
standards,
the
precise
(inaudible)
meaning
of
which
is
yet
to
be
determined
in
the
cases
that
come
up
and
in
specific
context
but
which
leaves
unimpaired
and
unlimited
in
any
substantial
way
the
role
of
the
court
in
deciding
the
issues
laid
before
it
and
making
the
conclusion
of
the
statute
that
directs
it
to
make
is
correct.
now,
and
with
regard
to
the
kinds
of
issues
as
i
were
saying,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
the
issues
that
have
been
mentioned
in
the
appellee's
brief
in
this
case
and
the
comptroller's
brief
esoteric
as
they
may
sound
in
a
way
they
were
put
can
all
be
translated
into
issues
which
are
the
kinds
of
issues
that
the
courts
have
repeatedly
dealt
with
in
antitrust
cases.
the
courts
have
long
dealt
with
all
manner
of
issues
bearing
on
the
competitive
consequences
of
mergers.
they
have
dealt
with
problems
of
market
definition
in
both
the
product
and
geographical
sense
and
some
industries
where
that
problem
of
market
definition
is
at
least
equally
as
complex
as
it
is
in
banking.
they
have
dealt
with
claims
that
a
merger
will
have
pro-competitive
consequences
by
providing
a
stronger
competitor
for
existing
larger
companies,
by
permitting
economies
of
scale,
by
providing
a
full
line
of
products
and
the
like.
the
courts
have
had
issues
like
this
before
them
an
antitrust
cases
whether
the
courts
in
any
particular
case
have
concluded
that
these
are
relevant
or
not
is
another
question,
but
they
are
not
issues
that
are
foreign
to
the
court.
now
as
i
said,
i
think
all
of
the
factors
that
have
been
cited
are
translatable
in
the
issues
of
this
kind
and
let
me
just
take
for
you
two
or
three
of
the
examples.
our
frequent
allegation
is
that
the
merged
institution
will
be
able
to
provide
services
which
neither
existing
bank
could
supply
or
could
supply
them
more
efficiently.
now,
you
can't
evaluate
a
claim
of
this
kind
except
in
terms
of
the
market
concerned
by
asking
for
whom
those
services
are
intended,
whether
those
customers
can
currently
get
them
from
other
sources,
that
is
to
say
whether
other
banks
providing
them,
and
whether
the
addition
of
another
supplier
which
allegedly
the
numerous
bank,
would
they,
will
or
will
not
materially
improve
the
competitive
performance
of
the
market.
this
is
true
for
example
of
the
issue
raised
by
the
appellee
banks
here.
they
claim
that
the
merged
bank
will
be
able
to
provide
a
wider
trust
service.
now
the
significance
of
that
can
only
be
evaluated
by
asking
how
many
other
sources
of
trust
service
are
there
in
philadelphia.
how
significant
would
the
addition
of
this
bank
--
of
this
further
bank
be
assuming
it
would
be
able
to
do
better
merged
than
unmerged.
let
me
take
the
question,
the
issue
which
is
commonly
relied
on
by
the
banking
agencies
in
approving
these
mergers
that
the
merged
bank
will
have
a
larger
loan
limit.
and
therefore,
will
become
an
additional
participant
in
the
large
loan
market.
now
this
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
the
merger
will
add
a
competitor
in
the
large
loan
market
and
again
the
question
is
how
important
is
this?
and
i
may
say
parenthetically
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
have
take
--
we
have
made
the
guess
and
the
prediction
that
the
bank
merger
act
will
not
substantially
affect
results
in
these
cases
is
that
by
and
large
as
indeed
parts
of
the
comptrollers'
opinions
point
out,
the
large
loan
market
by
and
large
is
already
a
highly
competitive
market
in
a
higher
numbers
of
banks
from
coast
to
coast
participate
so
that
normally
the
addition
of
one
more
bank
that
can
loan
$10
million
as
compared
with
six,
is
that
adding
any
bank
in
which
there
are
already
a
large
number
of
sources
competing
vigorously
for
that
kind
of
loan.
let
me
give
you
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
that,
would
be
an
aspect
of
the
question
that
i
have
just
read.
i
mean,
the
argument
could
be
made
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
even
though
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
oh
no,
the
courts,
i
am
sure,
i
cannot
pull
off
the
top
of
my
head
an
example
but
i'm
sure
that
in
the
past,
in
evaluation
of
competition
involves
--
and
valuation
of
service
as
well
as
price,
and
location
and
convenience
as
well
as
price.
and
of
course,
if
the
claim
is
made
that
the
addition
of
a
local
source
for
a
large
loan
is
significant,
you
--
this
is
a
factual
issue
which
you
can
get
at.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
commonly
argued
or
i'm
a
--
i
rather
suspect
assume
that
this
is
indeed
significant,
and
if
my
memory
is
correct,
there
was
testimony
by
some
businessmen
in
the
earlier
philadelphia
national
bank
case
that
indeed
having
a
local
bank
capable
of
19
large
loans
would
be
advantageous.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
a
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
this
is
an
issue
i
want
to
take
up
directly
in
just
a
moment.
this
is
another
aspect
i
think
of
the
same
claim.
now
again,
without
wanting
to
argue
the
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
poses
a
simpler
--
that
poses
a
fact
question,
the
testimony
of
these
people
can
be
evaluated.
it
may
not
be
worth
very
much.
i
have
here
for
example
an
interim
report
of
pennsylvania
banking
law
commission
which
asks
for
economists
to
study
the
banking
system
in
pennsylvania
and
what
should
have
done
about
it.
and
on
this
particular
issue,
one
of
the
economists,
professor
philips
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
says
there
is
little
evidence
beyond
that's
found
in
direct
support
of
merger
application
citing
the
philadelphia
bank
case
that
large
borrowers
are
in
fact
inconvenienced
by
having
to
rely
on
banks
in
other
cities.
shopping
for
large
loans
is
not
uncommon
and
the
incremental
cost
to
borrowers
--
of
contracting
banks
in
other
cities
are
negligible.
it
is
undemonstrated
and
improbable
if
the
industrial
growth
of
the
state
is
in
any
appreciable
way,
adversely
affected
by
the
absence
of
multibillion
dollar
commercial
banks.
now,
i
offer
that
again,
not
as
proof
of
the
proposition
but
simply
to
suggest
that
the
issue
that's
posed
there
is
one
(inaudible)
in
the
competence
and
familiarity
of
the
courts.
now,
the
example
i
was
about
to
get
to
which
i
think
boils
down
to
this
issue,
is
a
claim
that
--
to
rely
it
on
the
houston
case
that
the
increased
size
of
this
bank
will
contribute
to
growth
and
employment,
in
this
case
in
the
houston
area.
the
comptroller
--
and
i
quote
said
in
his
opinion,
"the
failure
of
the
houston
banks
to
keep
paced
with
the
growth
of
its
area
has
led
to
unfortunate
results.
cities
with
more
satisfactory
banking
facilities
can
attract
industry
which
needs
large
scale
financing.
moreover,
many
local
projects
are
simply
unable
to
obtain
financing
due
to
the
preference
of
large
banks
in
other
areas
for
projects
in
those
areas."
no
evidence
was
cited
to
support
these
conclusions.
and
interestingly
enough,
later
on
in
the
comptroller's
opinion
and
this
appears
on
page
115
of
our
brief,
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
relevant
market,
the
comptroller
says,
"banks
in
new
york,
boston,
chicago,
and
dallas
and
the
west
coast
entered
the
houston
area
and
obtained
sizable
loans."
in
1957
federal
reserves
study
for
example
report
that
new
york
banks
alone
held
$375
million
of
loans
to
houston
borrowers,
the
largest
amount
of
out-of-city
loans
made
by
new
york
banks
that
year.
this
intense
competition
from
out
of
state
bank
has
not
evaded
over
the
years
but
has
in
fact
increased
in
vigor.
now,
whether
the
comptroller
was
right
in
the
first
place
or
in
the
second
place
again
is
not
an
issue,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
issue
as
presented
is
not
one
so
esotery
that
it
cannot
be
dealt
with
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
claim
that
the
requirement
of
the
statute
that
the
court
may
have
to
balance,
convenience
and
needs
or
probable
effects
on
convenience
and
needs
against
any
competitive
consequences,
somehow
imposes
upon
the
court
a
burden
which
is
so
foreign
to
foreign
to
it
that
it
raises
serious
constitutional
questions
as
to
the
appropriate
division
of
legislative
and
judicial
responsibility.
i'm
frank
to
say
that
we
have
great
difficulty
understanding
the
courts
with
this
argument
because
what
it's
really
saying
is
that
courts
cannot
weigh
and
balance
conflicting
interest.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
--
i
will
give
some
specific
examples
mr.
justice
of
cases
that
have
arisen
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
in
which
people
are
certainly
endeavored
to
get
the
court
to
balance
and
wherein
fact
the
court
has
or
has
not
depending
upon
whether
the
claim
is
an
appropriate
one.
we
gave
in
our
--
and
in
antitrust
law
generally,
one
example
we
gave
is
the
court's
opinion
in
the
tampa
electric
case
involving
the
validity
of
the
requirements
contract
and
the
court
specifically
said
that
in
view
of
the
economic
benefits
to
both
parties
involved
in
requirements
contracts
that
the
rule
or
rather
harsh
rule
applicable
to
time
clauses
would
not
be
applicable
to
requirements
contracts,
even
though
the
economic
consequence,
and
say,
in
the
sense
of
foreclosure
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
now,
let
me
go
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
it
may
require
a
different
balance.
let
me
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
to
what's
appropriate,
that
is
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
let
me
--
yes.
let
me
give
a
specific
example.
it
has
been
held
at
least,
by
at
least
one
district
court
and
i
think
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
rule
on
it
at
least
in
dictum,
that
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
if
there
are
anticompetitive
consequences
from
a
merger
in
any
one
line
of
commerce
that
alleged
pro-competitive
benefits
in
another
line
that
may
be
affected
by
the
merger
are
irrelevant,
that
is
that
the
court
in
--
because
of
the
statute
cannot
offset
one
against
the
other.
it
seems
clear
that
to
us,
under
the
bank
merger
act
that
this
particular
rule
would
not
be
appropriate
in
bank
mergers.
banks
indeed
do
have
effects
on
several
different
lines
of
commerce
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
phrase,
if
that
--
to
give
effect
to
the
proposition
that
convenience
and
needs
made
at
some
time
clearly
outweigh
anticompetitive
effects.
but
that
is
one
of
the
circumstances
in
which
a
court
might
reach
that
kind
of
a
decision.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
decision
under
section
7
as
it
stands
depends
upon
the
language
of
that
act.
and
i
have
never
heard
anybody
suggest
that
there
would
be
anything
unconstitutional
for
the
court
to
have
reached
a
different
decision,
namely
to
say
that
in
evaluating
a
merger,
pro-competitive
consequences
in
one
line
may
be
offset
against
anticompetitive
consequences
as
a
--
in
another.
this
decision
was
an
interpretation
of
a
statute.
and
as
i
say,
i
never
heard
it
suggested
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
it
were
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
court
to
reach
a
different
result.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
that's
my
impression
of
what
their
argument
is
that
it
is
not
appropriate
for
a
court
to
make
decisions
of
this
kind.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
with
the
argument
is
that
the
banks
and
the
comptroller
have
described
what
i
would
call
simply
factual
issues
as
policy
issues.
let
me
give
you
an
example
from
the
appellees'
brief
in
the
provident
case
on
page
30,
they
say,
"in
the
final
analysis,
public
interest
means
what
is
good
for
the
community.
do
the
business
and
financial
institutions
in
the
community
need
banks
with
larger
lending
loans?
would
new
businesses
be
attracted
if
the
banks
in
the
community
offered
more
sophisticated
services?
would
the
merged
institution
as
the
trustees
to
attract
specialized
personnel?
will
it
be
efficient
enough
to
afford
them?
will
improvement
in
its
services
stimulates
its
competitors
to
improve
their
services?
these
are
the
questions
that
must
be
answered
and
then
they
say
these
are
preeminently
legislative
in
nature.
and
i
would
say
that's
a
mischaracterization.
they're
essentially
factual
in
nature.
and
that
the
kinds
of
factual
issues
that
the
courts
as
i
say
have
dealt
with
in
antitrust
law
repeatedly
and
it
seems
to
me
it
has
never
been
seriously
argued
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
balance
competing
interests.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
they
have
recourse,
i'd
--
i
think
under
the
general
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
hobbs
act
that
is
for
review
of
agency
determinations
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
of
the
statute
i
believe
mr.
metzger
was
describing.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
there
are
the
--
there
the
standard
would
be
in
a
court,
i
think
this
is
a
provision
that's
applicable.
it's
5
u.s.c.
706
--
well,
702
grants
the
right
of
review.
a
person
suffering
legal
wrong
because
of
agency
action
are
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
is
entitled
to
judicial
review.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
it's
sort
of
a
catch
all.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
then
706,
the
standard
is
as
follows.
the
reviewing
court
shall
compel
agency
action
unlawfully
withheld
or
unreasonably
delayed
and
hold
unlawful
and
set
aside
conclusions
found
to
be
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
abuse
of
discretion
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law,
and
unwarranted
by
the
facts
to
the
extent
that
the
facts
are
subject
to
trial
de
novo.
this
was
the
statute
involved
in
the
smithfield
case.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
short
of
it
is
that
if
the
agency
turns
them
down,
this
is
the
only
out
from
their
review
and
it
is
that
--
it
is
of
--
it
is
an
agency
review
test.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
and
that
of
course
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
it
could
be
argued
this
way
mr.
justice
fortas,
and
indeed
that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
comptroller
would
wish
you
to
adopt.
let
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
just
simply
say
that
the
two
situations
are
not
symmetrical
and
that
a
symmetrical
solution
therefore
is
not
appropriate.
the
mere
--
in
other
words,
i
see
no
good
reason
why
somebody
who
losses
on
the
merger
application
if
he
is
limited
to
a
review
for
abuse
of
discretion
is
necessarily
means
in
the
absence
of
any
statutory
declaration
to
the
contrary
that
the
antitrust
laws
should
be
repealed
in
their
application
to
merger's
that
are
approved.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
i,
--
my
comment
was
made
advisably
because
i
think
it
does
involve
or
repeal
the
antitrust
laws.
if
you
adopt
--
if
you
interpret
review
de
novo
to
be
coterminous
with
the
kind
of
review
that's
provided
in
the
hobbs
act,
or
agency
is
upset
only
if
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
findings
or
if
the
discretion
has
been
abused.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
sets
aside
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
then
it
comes
back
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
to
the
kinds
of
considerations
that
we
endeavored
to
put
forward
earlier.
i
mean,
i
have
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
congress
could
have
done
this.
there
were
several
bills
proposed
which
would
have
the
bill
that
was
proposed
--
that
was
finally
passed
provide
that
there'll
be
an
antitrust
proceeding,
directed
the
court
to
apply
that
same
standard,
as
that
with
the
agencies
apply,
as
a
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
court
wants
uniformity
as
among
agencies
and
between
agencies
in
the
court.
and
we
would
simply
say
again
that
we
don't
think
the
statute
that's
worded
in
this
way
is
appropriately
interpreted
by
virtue
of
focus
on
this
phrase
review
de
novo
which
incidentally
we
propose
to
have
this
rather
an
amazing
effect.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
--
i,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
can't
disagree
that
that's
the
issue.
that
is
the
issue
and
i
--
our
own
feeling
is
that
everything
points
against
that
kind
of
a
result.
again,
i'm
not
suggesting
for
the
moment
that
the
congress
could
not
have
(inaudible)
done
this.
but
there
are
very
clear
ways
of
doing
it.
and
there
were
bills
before
congress
which
would've
clearly
done
it
in
the
traditional
usual
way.
and
i
guess
what
we're
really
saying
is
that
the
phrase
review
de
novo
as
it
appears
in
this
statute
simply
will
not
bear
the
weight
of
a
conclusion
which
amounts
to
repeal
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
anybody
is
given
the
final
authority
to
determine
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
difficult
situation
is
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
set
aside,
that
there's
a
paramount
consequence
set
aside.
the
icc
can
approve
a
railroad
merger
even
though
it
has
anticompetitive
consequences
which
would
clearly
amount
to
a
violation
not
only
to
the
clayton
act
but
to
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
mergers
of
the
railroads,
mergers
of
trucks,
and
the
like.
the
anti
--
the
department
of
justice,
the
only
role
which
it
performs
is
an
intervener
before
the
agency
endeavoring
to
persuade
it,
not
to
approve
the
merger
if
it
doesn't
think
so.
but
if
the
agency
does,
the
avenues
opened
for
attacking
the
act
are
severely
limiting.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
they're
limited
in
that,
the
agency's
determination,
if
based
on
substantial
evidence
and
based
on
proper
procedures
and
if
they
handle
the
issues
right
as
a
matter
of
law
is
final
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
think
clearly
not
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
clearly
not,
clearly
not.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
our
position.
and
we
don't
see
any
good
reason
for
stretching.
there
is
no
problem
posed
for
a
court
here
that
is
so
insurmountable
or
even
close
to
it
that
there
is
a
reason
for
this
court
to
stretch
to
go
--
to
read
a
review
standard
into
this
legislation.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
mr.
justice
fortas
said,
of
course
the
federal
trade
commission
has
dual
jurisdiction
with
us
over
the
range
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
the
range
of
antitrust
law
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
that
being
subject
to
review.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes
sir
they
do.
they
have
hearings.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
that's
correct,
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
move
on
if
i
may
to
the
last
issue
which
is
short
of
the
issue
of
the
stay
which
i
--
well,
i
think
will
only
take
a
couple
of
minutes,
and
that
is
the
question
whether
if
we
are
right
so
far,
meaning
that
there
should
be
no
review
standard,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue
of
convenience
and
needs.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
there's
virtually
no
record
on
the
stay
motions,
the
parties
in
both
cases
put
in
extensive
submissions
of
affidavits
in
factual
assertions.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no.
the
--
well
in
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
provident
case,
there
were
more
extensive
proceedings
that
is
there
were
more,
that
the
case
got
farther
along
in
the
pretrial
stage
than
it
had
in
houston.
in
that,
the
judge
first
declare
--
overruled
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
a
pleading
question
and
then
there
was
a
pretrial
and
the
court
indicated
what
he
thought
the
government
had
to
prove
in
order
to
sustain
it's
case
and
it
came
out
in
the
course
of
our
various
submissions
that
we
were
not
prepared
and
we
did
not
believe
we
had
to
assume
the
burdens
which
has
pretrial
order
indicated
--
he
thought
which
he
had
assumed.
and
it
was
because
of
that,
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
were
removed
and
the
judge
then
granted
the
motion.
now
on
the
burden
of
proof,
i
would
again
point
to
the
language
of
the
statute
and
what
we
think
is
the
plain
implication
of
the
house
report
and
was
pertinent
legislative
history
indicating
that
what
was
created
here
substantially
was
an
exception,
the
ordinary
antitrust
principles
and
we
think
by
all
ordinary
standards
where
someone
is
claiming
the
benefit
of
an
exception,
it
is
up
to
them
to
plead
it
and
to
assume
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
issue.
i
will
quote
briefly
from
the
house
report.
it
says,
"the
bill
acknowledges
that
the
general
principle
or
the
antitrust
laws
that
substantially
anticompetitive
mergers
are
prohibited
applies
to
banks."
but
permits
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
applies
to
banks
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
reading
from
the
house
report.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
which
accompanied
the
final
bill.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
but
permits
an
exception
in
cases
where
it
is
clearly
shown
that
a
merger
is
so
beneficial
to
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
to
permit
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
that's
(inaudible).
now
of
course,
we
are
not
totally
unaware
of
the
elements
of
the
defense
--
what
the
defense
is
likely
to
be.
we
have
seen
the
submission
that
the
banks
have
made
to
the
--
proving
banking
agencies.
we
have
seen
sometimes
as
opinions.
sometimes
the
opinions
don't
come
out
till
after
we
file
our
case.
so
we
are
totally
unaware
but
it
seems
to
us
that
this
hardly
indicates
that
we
should
assume
the
burden
of
pleading
and
alleging
the
negative,
namely
that
there
are
no
convenience
and
needs
to
be
served
which
would
clearly
outweigh
the
competitive
considerations,
because
the
parties
are
clearly
free
to
drop
issues
they
have
raised,
to
raise
new
ones,
and
at
best
would
be
wasteful
to
compel
the
government
to
try
to
go
around
refuting
in
advance
claims
that
they
don't
even
know
will
be
made.
the
last
point
i
want
to
make
is
with
regard
to
the
stay
and
i
will
just
refer
you
i
think
to
our
brief
in
which
to
be
set
forth
in
some
detail
the
reasons
why
we
believe
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
us,
that
these
complaints
should
not
have
been
dismissed,
you
should
rule
that
the
statutory
stay
provided
for
in
the
bank
merger
act
automatically
revives.
we
of
course
are
not
contending
that
the
stay
--
that
the
--
that
you
should
decide
right
now
that
that
stay
should
stay
in
effect
forever.
on
remand,
the
parties
would
be
free
to
renew
their
motions
for
dissolution
of
a
statutory
stay.
we
--
our
contention
is
that
the
whole
tenure
of
the
act
which
is
entitled
a
view
to
prevent
the
need
for
dissolution
of
banks
indicates
that
this
statutory
stay
is
not
to
be
dissolved
except
on
a
very
heavy
showing
on
the
part
of
defendants.
and
here,
the
statutory
stays
were
dissolved
not
on
the
basis
of
any
showing
of
that
kind
but
concomitantly
with
the
dismissal
of
the
complaints.
and
if
this
court
should
rule
of
the
dismissal
was
inappropriate,
we
think
the
stay
should
revive.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there's
only
one
issue
that
we
care
to
comment
on
any
further
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
i
believe
that
all
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
as
to
just
how
a
review
procedure
suggested
by
the
appellees
in
these
cases
would
work
opposes
the
issue
very
sharply
as
to
whether
a
statute
like
the
one
we
have
here
really
contemplates
what
they
suggest.
mr.
ballard
and
the
comptroller
in
various
ways
attempt
to
resolve
the
questions
that
are
raised.
how
many
props
have
to
be
knocked
out
before
the
commission
--
for
the
agency's
opinion
is
to
be
set
aside?
what
if
the
bank
gives
new
reasons
not
given
before
--
not
put
before
the
agency?
what
if
the
government
puts
in
rebuttal
evidence
which
is
not
before
the
agency?
should
there
be
remand?
if
so,
when?
if
the
court
makes
its
own
determination
of
the
underlying
facts,
how
can
it
tell
whether
the
comptroller
abused
his
discretion?
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
these
problems
are
not
soluble.
this
court
in
the
end
could
determine
the
circumstances
in
which
remand
was
to
be
made
when
the
comptroller's
opinion
should
go
down.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
court
would
have
to
construct
a
detailed
set
of
review
procedure,
a
detailed
set
of
rules
governing
how
these
cases
would
be
disposed
of
and
that
these
seems
wholly
inappropriate
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
to
base
on
the
kind
of
the
statute
that
we
have
here.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes
you
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
as
i
say,
you
can
answer
the
question.
i'm
not
saying
the
questions
cannot
be
answered.
you
can
adopt.
you
could
lift
over
by
the
way,
the
procedures
set
forth
although
there
are
some
unresolved
issues
on
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
suggested
by
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
the
issue
we'll
put
and
we
simply
feel
on
the
basis
of
what
transpired
leading
up
to
this
legislation,
what
the
act
says,
consequent
reference
to
antitrust
proceeding,
the
fact
that
indeed
the
issues
raised
are
not
as
(inaudible)
as
arcane
if
they
might
have
first
like
--
seemed
to
be.
all
of
these
goes
to
suggest
that
--
whereas
indeed
that
solution
is
possible
that
is
not
appropriate.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
not
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
the
cases
know
how
would
come
out.
smithfield
in
fact
raises
some
rather
difficult
problems
which
i
think
judge
sobeloff's
dissent
alludes
to.
to
my
knowledge
and
my
knowledge
unfortunately
is
quite
well
on
this,
there
--
this
is
an
issue
that
has
not
been
settled.
in
these
(inaudible),
i
can
make
guesses.
but
in
the
statute
which
says
that
you
can
only
overturn
the
decision
that
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
if
it
is
the
kind
of
issue
which
was
normally
entrusted
to
the
agency
and
not
normally
made
by
the
judge,
i
suppose
you
find
facts
were
on
--
you
sent
it
back
and
have
him
try
again.
i
must
say
however
--
i
should
add
in
connection
with
the
comptroller's
and
the
other
banking
agencies
power
to
approve
that
they
can
and
have
disapproved
mergers
from
many
reasons
other
than
anticompetitive
consequences.
in
fact,
only
two
mergers
out
of
the
140
that
have
transpired
since
the
statute
has
passed
have
been
disapproved
and
they
have
been
disapproved
for
reasons
other
than
anticompetitive
consequences.
so,
what
he
--
or
the
approval
in
other
words,
the
approval
power
and
the
power
to
disapprove
is
not
coterminous
with
the
antitrust
or
even
with
--
coterminous
with
the
bank
merger
act.it
goes
well
beyond
that.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
(voice
overlap)
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
on
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
hesitate
to
introduce
testimonial
evidence
before
this
court,
but
in
response
to
your
question
we
had
no
such
idea.
i
can't
--
if
we
had
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
we
would've
--
we
would
rapidly
substituted
some
other
language.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
afraid
--
mr.
justice
fortas
it
wasn't
even
that.
if
it
were
held
that
this
--
the
use
of
this
word
were
decisive
i
must
say
from
our
standpoint
it
wouldn't
--
would've
been
one
of
the
greatest
inadvertencies
in
history.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
trust
not.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
and
in
retrospect
--
in
view
of
the
facts,
you
would've
had
an
easier
time,
i
wished
we
had
used
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
might
think
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
think
it's
broader
than
that
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
most
of
the
usual
questions
you
asked,
when
you're
asked
where
should
the
burden
of
proof
lie
fall
in
our
favor
in
this
of
a
question.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
most
of
the
evidence
is
--
in
fact
all
of
it,
a
good
part
of
it
on
convenience
and
needs
is
within
the
hands
of
the
banks
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
and
he's
got
better
access
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
would
--
he
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
he
is
wrong
in
having
decided
that
there
were
pro-competitive
benefits.
it
would
still
be
open
to
the
courts
under
our
view
of
the
proceedings
that
are
involved,
namely
the
independent
determination
of
the
issue
if
they
--
if
the
evidence
so
convinced
the
court
to
find
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
that
the
merger
would
serve
convenience
and
needs
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
and
this
would
clearly
outweigh.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
now
needless
to
say
that,
well,
we
have
not
been
--
will
not
concede
and
will
endeavor
to
disapprove
the
contentions
that
they
make
on
the
convenience
and
needs
and
we
will
most
earnestly
cross-examine
witnesses
and
the
like
and
we
will
argue
eventually
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
convenience
and
needs
that
are
alleged.
but
i
--
as
i
said,
the
case
is
not
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
this
is
an
issue
that
i
had
not
really
thought
of.
i
take
it,
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
even
that
the
antitrust
proceeding
just
stops
at
that
point
because
the
comptroller's
approval
is
erroneous
and
therefore
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
there
is
no
valid
approval
to
permit
them
to
go
ahead
and
merge.
i
take
it
that's
what
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
your
issue
--
your
point
is.
i
--
this
is
frankly
one
i
had
not
thought
of.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
the
disposition
of
this
case
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
dock
out
on
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
any
further
questions?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
and
the
succeeding
case
are
both
direct
appeals
under
the
expediting
act,
from
judgments,
dismissing
anti-trust
complaints
against
two
bank
mergers,
one
in
houston
and
one
in
philadelphia.
well,
the
cases
are
not
precisely
parallel,
the
main
issues
are
commendable.
both
we
and
the
comptroller's
officer
and
intervenor
have
read
them
together.
and
accordingly,
if
it
is
agreeable
to
the
court,
i
propose
to
present
more
or
less
a
coalesced
main
argument
but
i
shall
of
course
endeavor
to
and
deal
in
this
first
hour
with
specific
issues
raised
by
the
defendant
banks
in
the
houston
case.
these
cases
raised,
we
believe
some
basic
issues
of
interpreting
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
and
before
giving
you
a
brief
background
of
the
events
that
led
up
to
the
two
cases
now
before
you,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
quoted
the
principle
provisions
of
this
statute.
section
18
(c)
(5)
of
the
act,
provides
and
i
quote,
“a
federal
banking
agency
shall
not
approve,
and
i
insert
a
proposed
bank
merger,
whose
effect
in
any
section
of
the
country
may
be
through
substantially
lessen
competition,
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly,
or
which
in
any
other
manner
would
be
in
restraint
of
trade,
unless
it
finds
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.”
subparagraph
seven
provides
that
in
any
antitrust
action
other
than
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
brought
against
a
merger
approved
by
a
federal
banking
agency
and
again
i
quote,
“the
standards
applied
by
the
court
shall
be
identical
with
those
with
the
banking
agencies
are
directed
to
apply,”
by
the
provision
that
i
just
quoted.
and
finally,
and
again
i
quote,
“and
that
in
any
such
action,
the
court
shall
review
de
novo
the
issues
presented.”
now,
let
me
briefly
describe
to
you
a
--
the
background
of
two
cases.
first
city
national
bank
of
houston
and
southern
national
bank,
appellees
here,
applied
as
the
statute
requires
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
for
approval
of
their
proposed
merger
transaction.
the
comptroller
notified
the
other
two
approving
agencies
in
the
department
of
justice
who
submitted
as
the
statute
requires
their
assessment
of
the
competitive
factors
involved.
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
department
of
justice
both
reported
that
competitive
effects
would
be
adverse,
the
department
of
justice
using
the
adjective
seriously.
nevertheless,
the
comptroller
approved
the
merger
in
september
1966,
concluding
that
in
his
opinion
the
effects
of
the
merger
on
competition
will
not
be
adverse
in
the
houston
area
and
that
in
any
event,
any
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed
in
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
houston
community.
thereupon
within
the
30-days
limitation
provided
for
by
statute,
the
department
of
justice
filed
a
complaint,
challenging
the
proposed
merger
on
the
ground
that
it
might
substantially
lessen
violation
--
lessen
competition
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
the
facts
that
was
relied
on
among
others
and
i
will
be
very
sketchy
on
this
were
that
the
acquiring
bank
was
the
largest
bank
in
houston,
the
houston
area,
accounting
together
with
its
affiliates
were
approximately
29.6%
of
all
commercial
deposits
in
harris
county,
that
the
acquired
bank
was
the
6th
largest
commercial
bank
in
harris
county
and
with
affiliates
accounting
for
about
2.8%
of
commercial
deposits.
but
in
addition,
southern
was
the
fastest
growing
bank
in
--
in
the
city
having
only
been
recently
chartered
and
it
had
a
young
aggressive
management
which
indeed
has
been
cited
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
merger,
it
being
anticipated
that
that
management
will
play
an
active,
if
it
not,
dominant
role
in
the
merge
institution.
within
a
week
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
comptroller
intervened
and
next
day
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
facts,
sufficient
to
support
a
cause
of
action.
defendant
banks
thereupon
filed
a
motion
for
dissolution
of
the
statutory
stay
on
the
ground,
and
i
quote,
“the
plaintiff
has
made
no
allegation
challenging
the
findings
and
determinations
of
the
comptroller
than
any
--
that
any
anticompetitive
effects
resulting
from
a
proposed
merger
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
as
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.”
because
plaintiff
refuses
to
meet
its
statutory
burdens,
said
the
motion,
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
it
will
prevail
on
the
merits.
subsequently
at
the
hearing
on
december
2nd
the
district
court
ruled
as
we
understand
it
and
as
i
have
been
informed
by
counsel
for
the
comptroller
that
they
understand
it,
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
requires
the
government
to
plead
and
assume
the
burden
of
proving
not
only
that
the
merger
is
anticompetitive
but
also
that
the
competitive
injury
is
not
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
we
understand
that
it
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
view
of
the
court
was
that
under
the
bank
merger
act
--
after
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
the
government
must
plead
and
assumes
the
burden
of
proving
not
only
anticompetitive
consequences
which
would
normally
warrant
a
conclusion
that
section
7
has
been
violated,
but
was
also
proved
that
those
anticompetitive
consequences
are
not
clearly
outweighed
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
by
the
convenience
and
needs.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
they
dispute
this
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
and
i
will
get
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
they
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
would
be
an
issue
which
the
judge
in
the
houston
case
clearly
did
not
reach.
it
was
an
issue
which
we
believe
was
reached
by
judge
clary
in
the
provident
case
and
it
is
an
issue
again
that
we
--
we
shall
have
to
deal
with.
there
is
as
mr.
justice
fortas
suggested,
dispute
between
us
and
the
houston
banks
as
to
the
effects
of
the
district
judge's
ruling.
the
houston
banks
take
the
position
that
the
judge
did
not
even
reach
the
burden
of
proof
issue.
that
he
simply
ruled
that
the
government
had
to
allege
facts
from
which
it
could
be
determined
that
the
convenience
and
needs
did
not
outweigh.
and
as
i
indicated
i
will
--
i
will
take
up
that
question.
now,
on
the
basis
of
what
we
understood
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
to
be,
he
--
he
entered
his
order
and
gave
us
10
days
to
amend
our
complaint
to
comply
with
what
he
had
indicated
on
the
basis
of
our
understanding
of
what
his
ruling
was.
we
declined
to
amend
believing
that
the
issue
is
so
important
and
one
so
deserving
of
early
determination,
final
determination
that
it
should
be
taken
up
fast
and
accordingly
the
complaint
was
dismissed
and
we
brought
this
appeal.
now,
the
provident
case,
again
at
the
proposed
merging
banks,
provident
national
and
central
penn
made
their
application
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
for
approval
of
their
merger.
again,
both
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
department
of
justice
indicated
their
view
in
their
reports
on
competitive
factors
that
there
would
be
significant
adverse
competitive
effects.
again,
the
comptroller
approved
the
merger
including
that
rather
than
having
an
overall
adverse
effect
on
competition
and
i'm
quoting,
“it
will
have
a
favorable
effect
further
the
increased
ability
of
the
resulting
bank
to
serve
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
philadelphia
area
by
increased
deficiency
and
the
like
makes
this
merger
desirable.”
accordingly
the
--
again,
within
30
days
the
justice
department
filed
a
complaint
alleging
that
the
violation
violate
--
that
the
merger
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
very
briefly
the
facts
are
that
provident,
the
acquiring
bank
is
the
5th
largest
bank
in
the
four-county
philadelphia
area
accounting
for
9%
of
the
area's
bank
deposits.
central
penn,
the
proposed
acquired
bank
is
the
6th
largest
accounting
for
approximately
5%
of
the
deposits,
the
five
largest
banks
in
the
area
already
accounted
for
some
71%
deposits.
from
here
on
the
procedural
course
of
this
case
was
slightly
different,
the
comptroller
who
again
intervened
as
a
party
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
august
11th.
the
defendants
also
moved
to
dismiss.
they
argued
in
effect
that
the
government
was
unwilling
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
merger
was
not
justified
by
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
but
here,
the
district
court
initially
denied
these
motions
on
the
ground
that
the
action
was
then
only
at
the
notice
pleading
stage
and
the
complaint
was
adequate
to
apprise
the
other
parties
that
the
government
believed
the
merger
unlawful
under
the
clayton
act
as
modified
by
the
bank
merger
act.
however,
shortly
thereafter
on
november
4th,
the
district
court
ruled
that
in
order
to
prove
that
the
merger
was
unlawful,
the
government
would
be
required
to
show
both
of
the
merger
would
have
substantial
anticompetitive
effects
and
that
these
anticompetitive
effects
are
not
clearly
outweighed
by
convenience
and
needs.
the
court
then
went
further
and
indicated
that
it
would
give
great
weight
to
the
findings
of
the
comptrollers
stating
that
if
it
appears
that
the
decision
of
the
comptroller
is
dependent
upon
an
exercise
of
discretion,
the
court
will
vow
to
that
discretion
and
i
close
--
quote,
“unless
the
comptroller
abused,
exceeded,
or
arbitrarily
applied
it.”
now
then,
the
government
subsequently
indicated
by
various
filings
that
it
was
unwilling
to
assume
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
convenience
and
needs
issue.
accordingly,
the
banks
and
comptroller
again
moved
for
final
judgment
dismissing
the
complaint
and
these
motions
were
granted,
and
the
government
duly
appealed.
now,
in
both
of
the
--
there's
a
--
in
both
of
the
cases,
the
respective
district
courts
then
dissolved
the
statutory
stay
provided
for
in
the
bank
merge
act
of
1966,
stays
however
were
subsequently
obtained
in
this
court.
now,
before
proceeding
to
define
what
i
think
the
issues
are,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
indicated
to
you
what
is
not
in
dispute
here.
we
do
not
and
did
not
below
dispute
that
the
bank
merger
act
specifies
the
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
district
court
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
brought
against
bank
mergers
or
that
the
standards
are
presumably
different
to
some
extent
from
the
clayton
act
which
would
normally
apply.
the
government
in
no
way
has
intended
to
dispute
this
by
drafting
its
complaints
in
terms
of
section
7
only.
if
any
court
had
merely
requested
us
to
amend
their
complaints
to
make
reference
to
the
bank
merger
act,
we
would
have
done
so
even
we
thought
--
even
though
we
thought
it
was
unwarranted
for
reason
i
will
shortly
disclose
rather
than
take
so
narrow
an
issue
up
on
appeal.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
the
reason
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
again
i
--
and
i
hope
that
this
is
not
a
technical
response.
i
--
the
--
the
bank
merger
act
itself
creates
no
cause
of
action.
it
itself
sets
forth
--
sets
up
no
judicial
proceeding.
all
the
bank
merger
act
--
act
says
is
and
it
says
repeatedly
throughout
the
various
subsections
that
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
that
may
be
brought,
the
court
shall
apply
these
standards,
shall
review
de
novo
and
so
on.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
quote
--
the
statute
appears
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
page
70,
“any
action
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
arising
out
of
the
merger
transaction.”
in
any
such
action
that's
the
last
sentence.
the
court
shall
review
it
de
novo.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
then
in
the
next
subparagraph,
“in
any
judicial
proceeding,
attacking
a
merger
transaction
on
the
ground
that
in
and
of
itself
had
violated
any
of
the
antitrust
laws.”
so,
that
raise
judicial
proceeding,
again,
refers
to
the
antitrust
laws.
the
standards
applied
by
the
court
and
so
forth.
and
then
over
on
pa
ge
71,
subparagraph
(d),
“in
any
action
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws.”
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
there
would
be
--
here,
i
assume,
to
the
extent
relevant
and
there
will
undoubtedly
be
in
the
future.
many
arguments
between
the
government
and
any
prospective
defendants
as
to
what
the
significance
or
substance
of
those
changes
are.
but
we
can
--
we
have
always
agreed
that
the
bank
merger
act
as
it
clearly
says,
“sets
out
its
standards
which
are
applicable,
the
antitrust
proceedings
attacking
vague
grounds.”
now,
i
take
it,
(inaudible)
--
a
couple
of
things
i
don't
think
we're
in
dispute,
i
take
it
that
opposing
counsel
would
agree
that
the
complaints
of
the
government
stated
a
cause
of
action
insofar
as
the
clayton
act
is
concern,
and
insofar
as
the
an
--
as
anticompetitive
consequences
alluded
to
in
the
bank
merger
act
standard
are
concern.
i
doubt
that
they
would
agree
that
they
clearly
establish
a
clayton
act
violation,
but
i'm
sure
they
would
agree
in
light
of
von's
grocery,
pabst,
and
other
decisions
that
the
alleged
facts
have
--
at
least
gave
the
government
a
fighting
chance.
now,
given
--
endeavoring
to
get
these
issues
out
of
the
way,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
following
four
questions
are
presented
here,
all
of
which
are
great
importance
and
are
threshold
questions
insofar
as
the
bank
merger
act
is
concern.
first,
both
cases
we
believe
present
the
question
whether
once
the
government
in
an
antitrust
suit
challenging
a
bank
merger
establishes
that
the
merger
may
substantially
lessen
competition
defendants
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
merger's
anticompetitive
effects
are
clearly
outweighed
in
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
convenience
and
needs.
that's
the
first
issue.
now,
second,
and
a
related
issue
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
court.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
this
is
in
an
antitrust
proceeding
which
we
have
--
we
have
brought,
pursuant
to
the
antitrust
laws
and
indeed
the
--
the
continuing
validity
which
is
recognized
under
the
act.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
question
is
now,
who
has
--
what
is
the
disposition
of
burden
of
proof?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
can
put
it
another
way
by
saying
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
does
the
--
well,
that's
--
that's
the
second
issue
actually.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
let
me
put
it
this
way,
that
in
deciding
what
the
disposition
of
the
burden
of
proof
is,
it
must
meet
--
you
must
necessarily
face
what
i
would
call
i
second
question
and
the
ones
that
--
squarely
raised
by
provident
and
argued
almost
exclusively
by
the
banks
there
namely,
whether
the
statute
really
incorporates
a
review
standard.
the
kind
of
standard
appropriate
for
the
review
of
action
of
administrative
agencies
and
does
not
continue
in
effect
what
used
to
be
namely
that
the
court
itself
would
make
an
independent
determination
of
the
issues
presented?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
–
that's
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
i
quite
agree
that
you
can't
really
answer
burden
of
proof
issue
satisfactorily
without
getting
to
the
--
to
the
other
question
as
well
and
that
indeed
is
the
second
question.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
if
--
if
it
were
so
that
the
--
that
the
purpose
--
the
words
of
statute
and
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
turn
the
district
court
in
an
antitrust
proceeding
into
a
review
court,
clearly
our
complaints
are
defective.
we
would
have
to
plead
much
differently
than
the
way
we
pled
there.
we
would
plead
i
supposed
along
the
line
that
the
determination
of
the
comptroller
was
arbitrary
capricious
without
foundation
in
law
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
on
--
on
the
record.
and
we
clearly
did
not
plead
that
way.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
and
i
--
to
say
parenthetically
that
the
freedom
to
introduce
additional
evidence
on
part
of
all
parties
i
think
bears
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
review
standard
is
really
contemplated.
now,
the
third
issue
is
the
one
which
the
banks
have
raised
in
the
houston
case
which
is
peculiar
to
their
case
only.
they
claim
that
the
district
court
dismissed
the
houston
case
on
the
pleadings
without
reaching
any
question
of
burden
of
proof
and
that
consequently
their
case
raises
only
the
question
whether
the
department
must,
“alleged
facts
in
its
complaint
establishing
that
the
merger
will
have
anticompetitive
effects
which
are
not
clearly
outweighed.”
now,
i
think
the
final
issue
which
we
have
raised
is
whether
in
the
event
we
prevail
in
the
court
here,
the
statutory
stay
should
be
automatically
restored
on
remand
to
the
district
courts
with
the
parties
of
course
being
free
to
petition
again
for
dissolution
if
they
care
to
do
so.that
is
an
issue
which
clearly
comes
at
the
end.
now
i
would
have
deemed
it
most
appropriate
and
i
think
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
because
--
the
constitutional
issue
mr.
justice
harlan
which
was
raised
by
--
not
only
the
comptroller
but
the
provident
bank
is
tied
up
in
the
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
provides
for
a
review
standard
as
compared
with
the
standard
whereby
the
court
independently
makes
its
determination.
as
the
banks
argue
for
this
result
on
the
basis
that
--
very
briefly
they
claim
that
the
kind
of
job
which
the
bank
merger
act
requires
the
court
to
do
is
so
foreign
to
the
court
that
it
raises
serious
constitutional
questions
and
accordingly
this
court
should
--
should
read
the
act
as
--
as
making
a
review
court
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
district
court.
that
is
--
that
is
subsidiary
to
that
--
that
question.
now
i
would
have
normally
contemplated
taking
up
this
issue
first
because
it
is
clearly
primary
and
clearly
would
dispose
of
all
of
the
questions
that
are
involved
here
and
i
think
also
a
full
exposition
of
this
is
very
helpful
in
understanding
the
rest
of
the
issue
but
in
view
of
the
time
available
and
in
order
to
make
sure
that
i
do
get
to
this
in
fairness
to
defendant
banks
in
the
houston
case,
i
think
i
will
go
to
that
--
to
that
issue,
the
issue
which
is
peculiar
to
that
case
first.
now,
as
i
said
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
the
pleading
question.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
as
the
banks
contend
that
all
the
district
court
held
was
that
we
--
we
should
have
alleged
facts
pertaining
to
convenience
and
need,
and
did
not
reach
the
question
of
who
had
the
burden
of
proof.
now,
as
i've
already
indicated
that
was
not
our
understanding
and
it
is
not
the
understanding
of
the
comptroller
who
made
the
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
granted
by
the
court,
and
i
would
agree
that
the
question
is
not
entirely
free
from
doubt.
the
citations
to
the
record
made
by
the
houston
banks
cast
at
least
some
doubt,
but
i
would
refer
to
a
portion
of
the
transcript
which
they
do
not
refer
to
as
--
as
indicating
the
foundation
for
our
own
view
that
the
judge
was
in
fact
disposing
of
the
burden
issue.
this
is
on
page
3a
of
the
appellee
banks
brief,
the
appendix
to
their
brief.
the
court,
i
am
of
the
view
in
the
light
of
this
few
authorities
which
we
have
--
have
at
this
time
that
the
act
of
1966
made
some
rather
substantial
changes
in
the
law.
i
understand
the
cases,
and
he
was
referring
to
some
other
district
court
decisions,
to
hold
the
burden
to
be
on
the
plaintiff
to
alleged
and
prove
anticompetitive
result
of
this
merger
and
further
that
it
is
not
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
aspect
to
the
matter.
i
think
the
department
of
justice
has
continued
for
reasons
of
its
own
to
adapt
a
contrary
interpretation,
but
i
consider
these
cases
and
i'm
paraphrasing
as
authoritative,
at
least
at
this
time
further
i
think
the
petitions
fails
to
state
a
cause
of
action
in
that
it
alleges
only
the
first
step
and
not
the
second
step
which
is
necessary
for
the
plaintiff
to
support.
now,
as
i
say,
i
--
we
--
we
read
this
and
i
believe
the
comptroller
does
--
is
indicating
that
the
judge
was
in
fact
dismissing
our
complaint
not
only
--
not
merely
for
failure
to
allege
facts
but
on
the
basis
of
a
further
view
that
he
thought
the
burden
proof
on
the
balancing
issue
was
on
us.
but
let
me
--
if
we
assume
that
this
is
all
that
the
court
decided,
our
contention
would
be
that
that
ruling
itself
is
wrong
if
the
government
is
right
on
the
other
major
issues
which
are
before
the
court,
that
is
to
say
if
the
bank
merger
act
contemplates
an
independent
determination
by
the
court
and
if
as
we
urge
the
statute
clearly
sets
forth
convenience
and
needs
as
an
exception
to
a
general
antitrust
standard
and
as
an
exception
the
burden
falls
on
the
defendants
rather
than
on
the
government,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
the
judge's
holding
that
we
should
plead
facts
pertaining
to
--
to
convenience
and
needs
is
just
a
wrong
ruling.
if
the
government
does
not
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
convenience
and
needs
then
it
clearly
state
--
the
complaint
states
a
prima
facie
case
by
alleging
only
anticompetitive
consequences
and
it
is
not
a
defective
complaint.
moreover,
purely
as
a
matter
of
pleading,
a
plaintiff
does
not
normally
have
to
alleged
facts
(inaudible)
and
affirmative
defense.
indeed
there
have
been
some
cases
in
the
past
holding
that
ill-advised
lawyers
who
assert
such
facts
thereby
transfer
the
burden
of
proof
to
themselves.
so
the
short
of
it
is
--
we
believe
that
even
if
the
ruling
made
is
as
narrow
as
the
houston
bank
suggest,
it
is
wrong
if
we
are
right
on
the
issues.
moreover,
and
this
is
my
final
point
on
this
question,
if
the
court's
ruling
was
as
limited
as
the
houston
bank
suggest
and
if
the
narrow
ruling
was
correct
neither
of
which
propositions
we
agree
with,
it
seems
to
us
that
fairness
would
dictate
that
the
case
be
remanded
with
the
directions
that
the
government
be
given
lead
to
amend
and
our
reasons
are
two,
that
if
the
judge
rule
that
way,
it
was
at
best
terribly
unclear
and
if
he
had
been
clear
that
the
government
would
--
would
have
elected
to
amend
rather
than
taking
intermediate
appeal
on
so
narrow
a
point
to
this
court.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
were
--
we
were
given
the
opportunity.
we
did
not
amend
because
we
believed
that
the
judge
had
ruled
to
the
reasons
that
i
have
suggested
namely
that
he
--
he
was
--
he
--
he
was
dismissing
the
complaint
unless
we
amended
it
on
the
basis
of
his
position
that
the
government
not
only
had
to
allege
that
anticompetitive
–-
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
consequences
were
not
clearly
outweighed
but
had
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
why
we
did
not
amend
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
we
did
not
amend
because
the
broad
ruling
is
one
of
such
vital
significance
that
we
thought
it
appropriate
to
take
an
appeal.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
very
briefly,
we
have
before
us
two
cases
involving
bank
mergers
and
dismissal
of
complaints
brought
by
the
government
involving
interpretation
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
and
more
particularly
the
following
provisions.
the
act
provides
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
approve
a
bank
merger,
the
responsible
banking
agency
whose
approval
is
required
shall
not
approve
any
proposed
merger
transaction
whose
effect
in
any
section
of
the
country
may
be
to
substantially
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
or
in
which
in
any
other
manner
would
be
in
restraint
of
trade
unless
it
finds
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
the
statute
further
provides
that
in
any
action
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws
challenging
a
merger
which
has
been
approved
by
a
bank
agency,
the
court
shall
review
de
novo
the
issues
presented.
and
it
further
provides
that
in
any
antitrust
proceeding,
the
standards
applied
by
the
court
shall
be
identical
with
those
the
banking
agencies
are
directed
to
apply
under
paragraph
5,
the
paragraph
which
i
just
quoted.
now
yesterday,
i
endeavored
to
discuss
one
issue
raised
by
the
houston
banks
in
their
case,
namely
an
issue
--
a
claim
that
the
dismissal
in
that
case
was
simply
on
the
basis
that
the
government
has
failed
to
allege
facts
concerning
convenience
and
needs
rather
than
on
the
basis
that
the
government
had
failed
to
meet
the
burden
of
proof
on
both
competitive
needs
and
the
competitive
consequences
and
convenience
and
needs.
today
i
want
to
address
myself
to
what
we
deem
to
be
the
two
major
issues
on
the
case
which
are
closely
interrelated.
and
the
first
is
whether
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
contemplates
that
in
an
antitrust
proceeding,
the
function
of
the
court
really
is
to
apply
a
review
standard
to
the
determination
made
by
the
banking
agency,
that
is
to
say
the
kind
of
review
standard
that
would
be
applied,
say
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
the
action
of
the
ordinary
administrative
agency
made
on
the
basis
of
the
full
hearing
and
the
full
record.
second,
assuming
that
this
is
not
so,
that
it
is
the
function
of
the
court
to
make
an
independent
determination
and
come
to
its
own
conclusion
whether
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
to
allege
and
prove
not
only
the
necessary
anticompetitive
consequences
but
also
the
--
a
negative
proposition
that
these
are
not
out
--
not
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
but
whether
on
the
other
hand,
that
is
a
matter
to
be
--
to
be
raised
by
defendants
with
the
burden
lying
on
them.
yes
mr.
justice?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
as
if
we
--
if
it
is
a
review
procedure,
not
only
is
the
burden
on
the
government
to
allege
and
prove
the
negative
proposition
that
i
have
just
suggested
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
probably
considerably
more
than
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
namely
that
the
determination
of
the
agency
either
was
based
on
insubstantial
evidence
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
or
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
justice,
i
--
we
think
it
is,
as
i
think
i
tried
to
indicate
yesterday,
i
--
we
wouldn't
--
we
would
not
have
raised
in
the
serious
objection
if
the
point
you
now
make
was
made
by
the
district
judge
and
he
had
said,
"won't
you
please
amend
your
complaint
to
read
--
say
--
to
charge
a
violation
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966."
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
i'm
afraid
i
lacked
court
experience
but
in
any
event,
if
this
point
have
been
made,
we
would
have
had
no
objection
of
that.
i
think
our
complaints
were
technically
correct
because
the
bank
merger
act
as
i
suggested
yesterday
does
not
itself
create
a
cause
of
action.
the
cause
of
action
is
still
an
antitrust
cause
of
action
and
what
the
bank
merger
act
does
is
as
you've
--
as
you
pointed
out
and
as
we
all
know
is
obvious
indicate
that
in
a
antitrust
action
involving
a
bank
merger,
the
court
shall
apply
the
particular
standard
that
is
set
forth.
now,
i
find
it
little
hard
to
see
why
the
trial
can't
proceed
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
as
the
government
has
drafted
it,
so
long
as
everybody
is
aware
of
the
proposition
that
i've
just
suggested.
i
think
it
makes
a
little
difference
to
us
whether
the
complaint
reads
one
way
or
the
other.
i
don't
think
it's
a
decisive
question
or
one
that
has
any
material
impact
on
the
way
that
the
case
would
be
tried,
nor
does
it
leave
the
defendants
unaware
of
what
the
issues
are.
now
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
question
as
to
whether
this
statute
gives
to
the
antitrust
court
the
task
of
simply
reviewing
the
agency
determination
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
it
was
arbitrary,
capricious
or
not,
or
whether
it
gives
to
the
court
it's
normal
function
in
an
antitrust
case
of
making
an
indeterminate
--
an
independent
determination
of
the
issues
that
are
raised.
now
of
course
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
bank
merger
act
clearly
contemplates
that
the
court
in
many
cross
action
involving
a
bank
merger
shall
make
an
indetermine
--
independent
determination
of
the
legality
of
the
merger
under
the
standards
of
the
act
and
not
merely
review
the
banking
agency's
determination
to
see
if
it
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence
or
it
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
let
me
--
the
sequence
was
this.
trial
de
novo,
it
was
used
in
one
letter
by
the
attorney
general,
a
letter
i
believe
dated
september
24.
the
phrase
review
de
novo
appeared
in
the
proposed
draft
of
a
statutory
provision
laying
down
standards
applicable
to
bank
mergers
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
appearing
in
the
letter
of
january
5th
--
accompanying
a
letter
of
january
5th,
1966.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
we
do
mr.
justice.
the
comptroller's
brief
suggest
some
executive
history
if
i
may
call
it
that,
to
the
effect
that
there
was
some
significance
in
the
change
of
words
from
trial
to
review
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
can
only
say
having
been
a
participant
and
i
would
not
raise
this.
i
don't
want
to
say
to
myself
having
been
a
participant
in
all
of
the
agency
discussions
that
i
do
not
share
their
recollection.
my
recollection
is
that
the
question
never
came
up.
i
think
--
in
short
of
it
is,
our
position
is
that
the
words
are
really
interchangeable.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
there's
no
particular
significance
to
be
attached
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
to
one
or
the
other.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
i
don't.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
that
was
involved
in
the
smithfield
case
which
is
cited
rather
heavily
by
appellees
in
both
of
these
cases
did
not
itself
use
the
phrase
review
de
novo.
it
used
the
word
trial
de
novo.
and
i
must
say
having
read
the
case
that
i
failed
to
see
how
it
supports
the
position
of
the
appellees
argue
that
it
does,
to
me
it's
manifest
from
reading
the
opinion
that
the
court
is
using
the
words
trial
and
review
de
novo
interchangeably.
the
statute
as
i
said
uses
the
word
trial
de
novo,
courts
to
review
and
will
set
aside
the
determination,
it
found
to
be
unwarranted
by
the
facts
to
the
extent
that
the
facts
are
subject
to
trial
de
novo.
that
was
the
statute
the
court
was
interpreting
in
that
case.
and
later
on,
the
court
prior
to
remanding
said,
"we
will
request
the
court
below,
the
district
court
to
review
de
novo
the
action
of
the
comptroller."
as
i
said
it
seems
to
me
that
as
far
as
that
court
was
concerned,
there
was
no
particular
significance
in
using
one
word
or
the
other.
i
must
say
that
the
attorney
general
who
existed
--
a
legislation
which
would
have
removed
antitrust
jurisdiction
to
the
end
would
hardly
calculate
that
they
abused
the
phrase
review
de
novo
in
his
own
proposed
statute,
if
it
had
the
consequences
that
the
appellees
now
contend
that
it
does.
now
--
but
for
the
problem
mr.
justice
brennan
that
you
have
just
raised,
namely
whether
there
is
any
peculiar
significance
in
the
use
of
the
word
review
as
opposed
to
trial,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
words
of
the
statute
clearly
give
to
the
court
the
responsibility
of
making
its
normal
independent
determination
of
the
issues
that
are
presented
in
an
antitrust
case
involving
bank
mergers.
the
only
difference
being
that
the
issues
may
be
somewhat
broader
and
somewhat
different
in
response
to
the
different
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
directs
the
court
to
apply.
we
would
also
suggest
that
this
consequence
is
made
perfectly
clear
by
the
legislative
history
including
most
particularly
the
fact
that
bills
wre
rejected
which
would
have
either
immunized
bank
mergers
once
approved
by
the
banking
agencies
from
antitrust
attack
or
would
have
provided
precisely
the
kind
of
review
that
appellees
now
suggest
the
statute
the
respondent
asked
did.
in
fact,
the
original
bill
proposed
by
senator
robinson,
s.
1698
provided
that
--
it
would
have
provided
that
the
authority
to
approve
mergers
consolidations
and
acquisitions
herein
conferred
on
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
the
board
of
governors,
and
the
court
--
and
fdic
shall
be
exclusive
and
plenary
and
any
banks
participating
in
any
transaction
authorized
or
approved
under
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
be
and
they
are
relieved
from
the
operation
of
antitrust
laws.
that
was
senator
robertson's
original
proposal.
the
original
proposal
by
representative
ashley
in
the
house,
h.r.
11011
would
have
provided
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
precisely
identical
with
the
kind
of
review
say
of
an
ftc,
an
fpc,
or
an
fcc
determination
providing
anybody
including
the
attorney
general
could
go
to
the
court
and
in
that
court,
the
findings
of
the
agency
as
to
the
facts,
if
supported
by
substantial
evidence
shall
be
conclusive
and
all
the
other
usual
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
that
would
have
been
an
interesting
problem
if
that
bill
had
passed.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
--
well,
i
take
it
back.
that
actually
--
bill,
i
think
it
provide
for
a
hearing,
so
that
would
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
have
solved
that
problem.
i'm
not
absolutely
sure
on
that
and
if
i'm
wrong,
i
will
correct
it
later.
my
recollection
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
if
there
--
any
effort
is
made
of
course
in
court
of
appeals
to
produce
new
evidence,
that
must
be
by
way
of
motion,
namely
--
and
the
normal
procedure
would
be
then
to
remand
that
the
court
thought
that
the
new
evidence
was
pertinent
and
should
be
heard,
the
normal
procedure
would
be
to
remand
the
court
--
to
the
agency
itself
to
reopen
the
record
and
reconsiders
determinate
--
the
matter
on
the
basis
of
the
new
evidence.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
ashley
proposal
did,
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
and
that
was
incidentally
the
bill
which
was
most
strongly
criticized
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
first
letter
to
chairman
patman
of
september
24th,
1965.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right
and
--
well,
as
the
attorney
general
pointed
out
in
that
letter,
the
--
there
are
vast
number
of
applications
for
bank
mergers,
they
run
in
the
hundreds.
there
has
not
been
in
the
past
provision
for
hearings
and
this
makes
sense
because
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
are
such
that
--
certainly
insofar
antitrust
considerations
are
involved,
there's
no
problem
that's
going
to
be
presented.
and,
the
enormity
of
the
test
that
would
be
assumed
by
the
banking
agency
is
they
have
full
scale
hearings
on
each
one
of
these
applications
would
be
really
great.
well
--
but
the
point
that
was
made
was,
given
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
abbreviated
disposition
is
appropriate
for
bank
agency
approval.
this
clearly
suggests
that
in
any
judicial
proceeding
brought
under
the
antitrust
laws,
that
that
determination
should
not
get
the
kind
of
weight
that
an
administrative
agency
determination
normally
gets.
and
it
was
suggested
that
--
in
that
letter
and
in
the
later
letter,
although
we
did
not
get
exactly
the
statute
we
wanted,
that
in
terms
of
the
standards
that
the
appropriate
way
of
dealing
with
this
matter
was
the,
why
do
we
think
the
bank
merger
act
finally
did
deal
with
it?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
to
the
determination
mr.
justice
as
such,
it
seems
to
me
none.
to
expertise
on
particular
issues,
i
don't
think
there's
any
single
answer
to
that.
that
is
in
urging
of
this
act
does
not
give
the
court
simply
a
review
function
for
reviewing
the
determination
of
the
comptroller.
we
are
not
urging
for
the
other
banking
agency,
we
are
not
urging
at
all
that
the
expertise
of
those
agencies
to
the
extent
that
it
exist
and
with
regard
to
the
particular
issues
in
which
it's
important
is
going
to
be
disregarded.
they
have,
as
you
know
by
statute,
the
opportunity
to
appear
as
a
party,
an
opportunity
that
has
been
taken
every
time
it
has
been
presented,
whether
they
appear
as
a
party
or
not,
the
banking
agency
official
could
appear
as
a
witness
and
evidence
can
be
put
in.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
--
he
wouldn't
be
entitled,
you
know,
to
the
treatment
of
the
--
that
any
expert
would
(voice
overlap)
be
entitled
to.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
it
would
be
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
again,
i
would
say
that
under
the
procedures
that
are
established
as
properly
interpreted,
the
final
determination
of
the
agency
is
not
entitled
in
anyway.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
the
actual
court
proceeding,
when
particular
issues
came
up
that
may
have
peculiar
aspects
about
them
on
which
the
banking
agency
may
have
expertise,
the
court
may
well
pay
that
rather
high
regard.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
well,
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
factual
statements
as
such,
i
would
suppose,
could
not
be
introduced
as
evidence
and
these
are
more
in
the
nature
of
con
--
fact
conclusions
not
evidence.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
in
the
court
proceeding,
the
facts
that
laid
behind
those
findings
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
would
presumably
have
to
be
adduced.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
well,
whether
they
would
be
admissible
as
evidence,
and
if
so,
for
what
purpose
would
be
a
matter
for
the
ordinary
rules
of
evidence.
if
--
again,
if
they're
conclusory,
they
would
be
open
to
challenge
on
the
basis
of
the
--
on
the
ground
that
the
basic
facts
have
not
have
been
presented.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct,
but
i
would
--
you
know,
in
a
sense,
retrial
is
not
an
appropriate
word
because
in
--
and
a
lot
of
these
issues,
if
not
all,
all
of
them
never
have
been
tried
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
have
never
been
tried
because
of
the
summary
nature
of
the
proceedings
before
the
banking
agency.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
just
two
or
three
points
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
why
it
is
we
think
the
conclusion
we
urge
is
correct.
one
is
this,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
act,
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
act
was
clearly
to
eliminate
the
application
of
disparate
standards
among
the
banking
agencies
and
between
the
baking
agencies
in
the
courts.
it
is
--
or
a
thread
running
through
the
entire
legislative
history
and
the
relevant
reports
is
the
desire
that
there'd
be
uniformity
insofar
as
the
standards
applied
by
the
agencies
and
the
courts
are
concerned.
now,
we
simply
point
out
that
you
cannot
achieve
uniformity,
in
fact
you
clearly
do
not
as
between
court
and
administrative
agencies
if
the
administrative
agencies
are
directed
to
apply
the
standards
that
the
bank
merger
act
sets
forth,
and
the
court
applies
not
those
standards
but
a
review
standard
overturning
the
agency
determination
only
if
it
finds
it
arbitrary
and
capricious.
those
are
not
the
same
standards,
those
are
different
standards.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
i'd
--
i
would
prefer
not
to
tackle
the
other
questions
if
i
--
[laughter]
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
am
simply
contending
a
--
suggesting
that
with
regard
to
this
particular
area,
it
seems
clear
to
us
from
the
legislative
history
that
among
the
things
of
principal
concern
to
congress
was
a
feeling
that
the
standards
of
the
bank
agencies
were
applying
in
approving
or
disapproving
mergers
were
quite
dissimilar
from
those
that
had
been
applied
by
the
courts.
to
be
specific,
i'm
sure
it
was
felt.
indeed,
i
think
it
was
suggested
at
more
than
one
point
that
the
banking
agencies
were
not
applying
the
standard
of
philadelphia
national
bank.
and
what
congress
wanted
to
do
is
to
make
sure
as
best
as
it
could,
that
at
east
they
started
out
trying
to
apply
the
same
standards.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
you
can't
--
that
aim
would
not
be
achieved
if
the
agencies
are
directed
to
apply
particular
standards
and
the
court
simply
applies
the
kind
of
review
that
is
normally
made
for
an
administrative
agency.
moreover
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
oh!
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
i
think
--
i
have
the
committee
report
here
and
it
says
the
major
purpose
of
the
bill
is
to
resolve
the
apparently
conflicting
interpretations
which
have
been
made
--
given
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960.
this
is
the
house
report
to
the
company
declining
the
bill
that
was
passed.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
not
sure
at
this
point
that
i
understand
the
question
maybe
i'd
better
restate
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
there
was
or
thought
to
be
--
there
was
--
or
there
was
or
thought
to
be
by
the
congress
a
difference
in
approach.
and
i
must
say
i
don't
suppose
anybody
really
disputes
that
proposition.
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
bank
merger
act
was
to
--
as
best
as
you
can,
eliminate
that
difference.
and
my
argument
is
that
you
don't
eliminate
it
by
applying
--
by
putting
the
courts
in
the
position
of
applying
a
review
standard.
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there's
not
one
bank
agency
but
three
who
can
take
quite
different
approaches
to
these
questions
as
indeed
these
cases
indicate
and
both
of
these
cases,
the
federal
reserve
board
made
a
different
assessment
of
the
competitive
factors
than
did
the
comptroller.
and
if
the
court's
function
is
limited
simply
to
one
of
reviewing
the
agency
determination
to
see
if
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious,
it
is
impossible
to
bring
the
agencies
into
some
sort
of
line
because
they
could
pursue
substantially
diverse
halves
in
assessing
factors
of
this
kind
and
still
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
will
--
if
i
may
continue
this
argument
a
little
later,
i'd
like
to
save
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
bank
merger
act.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
any
other
--
that's
right.
and
the
issue
i've
not
yet
reached,
but
i
will
do
in
arguing
the
second
case
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
is
whether
that
is
--
i
mean
the
second
case
that
is
here
before
us
now.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
is
whether
that
proposes
any
peculiarly
difficult,
impossible
burdens
on
the
court.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
and
i'd
like,
as
i
may,
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal
on
this
case.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice
i'm
going
to
utilize
what
time
remains
for
brief
comments
on
points
made
by
mr.
searls
and
i
think
--
i
only
have
two
to
make
and
one
is
in
the
nature
of
a
restatement
of
our
view
on
the
bank
merger
act
and
the
pleadings
in
response
to
the
formulation
of
the
houston
bank's
position
that
developed
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
searls
and
mr.
justice
fortas.
and
in
substance,
our
view
is
simply
that
all
the
bank
merger
act
does
is
to
create
a
defense
like
the
mcguire
act
creates
a
defense
to
a
charge
of
resale
price
maintenance.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
was
my
second
comment.
that
--
but
--
just
to
finish
up
with
this,
we
think
simply
it
creates
another
defense
namely
that
a
merger
otherwise
unlawful
is
not
unlawful
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
are
so
served
but
this
clearly
outweighs
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
sir?
well,
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
our
position
is
--
it
will
be
due
--
i
will
say
it
here
and
we
will
certainly
assert
it
in
any
proceedings
below
in
cases
that
this
omission
is
inadvertent
of
no
particular
consequence.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
don't
think
that
were
saying
--
that
i've
been
saying
two
different
things
here.
first,
as
to
whether
the
omission
of
the
phrase
in
any
line
of
commerce
is
significant,
it
is
indeed
arguable.
it
is
arguable
if
that
indeed
it
was
deliberate
and
significant
and
works
a
significant
change
in
the
standards
to
be
applied,
i
could
possibly
dispute
that.
i
will
hasten
to
the
add
as
i've
said
a
moment
ago
to
the
view
of
the
government
that
this
is
not
so
and
i
might
briefly
indicate
the
reasons
why
it's
inconceivable
to
us
how
you
can
conduct
any
rational
inquiry
as
to
what
the
consequences
of
a
merge
--
bank
merger
is
going
to
be
unless
you
have
some
idea
of
the
lines
of
commerce
affected.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
now
you
can't
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
you
can't
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
mean,
the
--
if
the
proposition
would
be
that
you
should
so
to
speak
and
i
think
the
position
of
the
comptroller
boils
down
to
this,
that
you
should
disregard
plain
economic
common
sense
in
the
definition
of
market
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
and
we
don't
think
that's
appropriate.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
on
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
and
we
do
not
--
that,
i
--
we
do
not
dispute
and
i
don't
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
proposition
i'm
just
suggesting.
we
do
not
dispute
with
the
bank
merger
act
standard
is
applicable
in
a
section
7
proceeding
and
incidentally
we
have
never
disputed
this
below.
i
could
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
oh,
i
didn't
concede,
it's
an
error
of
law.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
i
--
by
my
position
to
restate
it
and
i
--
i'm
sorry
if
i
didn't
make
it
clear,
is
that
bank
merger
act,
to
know
bank
merger
act
is
a
matter
of
pleading,
what
is
involved
is
an
antitrust
case.
that's
what
is
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
referred
to
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
in
the
bank
merger
act
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
to
bring
an
antitrust
proceeding.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
now,
if
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
it
maybe
more
artful
pleading
and
it
may
be
more
appropriate
pleading
to
say
--
to
charge
a
violation
of
section
7
as
amended
by
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
that
is
not
in
--
that
may
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
not
in
so
many
words.
that's
another
reason
why
we
didn't
--
it's
just
simply
as
a
matter
of
pleading.
we
just
saw
a
particular
point
to
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
it's
not
as
clearly
to
say
the
court
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
shall
apply
the
standards
set
forth.
that
we
do
not
dispute.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
made
a
section
7
action.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
correct.
that's
right.
i
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
a
merger
case,
the
section
1
sherman
act
charges
redundant
and
we
don't
deal
--
and
that
we
just
don't
use
it
anymore.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
that
completes
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
my
rebuttal
on
this.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
simply
continue
my
discussion
of
the
nature
--
of
what
we
view
to
be
the
nature
issues
in
this
case
only
briefly
restating
before
i
proceed
our
principal
--
the
principal
arguments
i
have
covered
as
to
why
we
believe
under
the
bank
merger
act
the
court
is
still
as
in
any
antitrust
case
required
to
make
an
independent
determination
and
i
will
simply,
briefly
summarize
the
points
we
think
the
statute
is
clear
in
a
way
that
it
reads,
it
provides
that
the
court
shall
apply
the
identical
standards
which
the
agency
is
directed
to
apply,
and
clearly
a
review
standard
would
not
be
an
identical
standard.
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
review
de
novo
of
the
issues
presented,
not
the
determination
made
by
the
banking
agency.
finally,
it's
clear
enough
to
all
that
the
review
standard
would
amount
to
an
outright
repeal
of
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
bank
mergers
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
--
repeals
by
implication
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
likely
to
be
implied.
and
we
think
certainly
a
repeal
should
not
be
implied
where
as
noted
in
this
court's
opinion
in
philadelphia
bank,
direct
regulation
of
the
banking
industry
does
not
extend
that
the
prices
charged
for
banking
services
and
were
accordingly
the
maintenance
of
competition
is
highly
important
for
reasons
also
stated
in
philadelphia
bank
opinion
which
we
think
are
completely
valid
competition
in
fact
may
even
be
more
important
in
this
industry
than
in
others
because
of
it's
effects
upon
entry
in
other
businesses.
and
certainly
finally
repeal
should
not
be
implied
or
presumptive
weight
given
to
an
immunizing
decision
that
is
based
not
on
a
full
scale
administrative
adversary
hearing
with
full
opportunity
for
cross-examination
of
witnesses
and
other
presentation
of
evidence
were
on
the
kind
of
summary
proceeding
that
is
involved
here.
and
very
briefly
again
with
regard
to
the
legislative
history,
we
simply
point
to
the
fact
that
several
bills
which
would
have
done
what
the
appellee's
laim
was
done
here
were
rejected
by
congress
and
the
bill
that
you
have
before
you
was
passed.
now
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
one
bill
would
have
mr.
justice
black.
the
original
bill
filed
was
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
he
may
speak
for
himself.
i'm
quite
sure
that
he
would've
been
delighted
with
such
a
solution.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
again,
i'm
not
fully
familiar
your
honor
with
all
of
the
statements
that
the
comptroller
has
made
but
i
think
it
is
a
fair
representation
that
is
viewed
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
that
indeed
he
would
have
favored
legislation
which
would
have
eliminated
the
right
of
the
department
of
justice
to
obtain
in
the
court
antitrust
proceeding
and
independent
determination
of
validity
of
a
merger.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
this
would
would've
been
provided
for
by
the
original
bill
filed
by
senator
robertson.
robertson
s.
1698
would
have
immunized
from
the
operation
the
antitrust
laws
determinations
made
by
the
banking
agencies.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
there
were
no
differences
ironed
out
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
bill
that
finally
passed
to
the
house
was
submitted
to
the
senate
and
passed
to
--
the
best
of
my
recollection,
without
change
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
as
a
substitute
to
the
senate
bill.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
now
incidentally,
there's
one
aspect
of
the
legislative
history
which
--
which
none
of
us
have
brought
out
and
that
is
another
purpose
of
the
legislation
and
at
least
some
of
the
esteem
behind
it,
was
a
desire
to
eliminate
divestiture
in
three
bank
cases
that
the
government
had
won.
and
in
fact
the
bill
that
passed
the
senate
was
a
bill
that
did
nothing
else
but
that.
it
had
no
impact
on
substantive
rules
and
antitrust
proceedings
in
future
cases
at
all.
it
would
have
provided
a
30-day
limitation,
but
insofar
as
substantive
rules
were
concerned,
the
bill
that
first
passed
the
senate
would
have
simply
immunized
pending
cases.
and
then
after
the
rather
tortured
progress
of
this
through
the
house,
the
bill
was
--
we
finally
see
was
passed
by
the
house
and
was
substituted
in
the
senate
and
there
was
no
further
--
there
were
no
further
changes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
was,
that
language
is
precisely
the
language
that
the
attorney
general
proposed
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
in
his
letter.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
understand
that
to
mean,
your
honor,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
it
means
that
once
an
antitrust
case
is
filed
attacking
a
bank
merger,
that
all
of
the
relevant
issues
that
are
raised
under
the
appropriate
standards
are
to
be
tried
the
way
--
the
court
de
novo
and
the
determination,
the
final
conclusion,
the
final
determination
made
by
the
banking
agency
is
not
of
itself
to
be
given
presumptive
weight.
that's
what
we
understand
that
to
mean.
now,
as
i
indicated
in
a
response
earlier
to
a
comment
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
are
not
by
any
means
denying
that
the
banking
agencies
have
expertise
which
--
in
such
court
proceeding
may
on
one
or
several
issues
get
a
considerable
amount
of
weight,
depending
on
the
persuasive
quality
of
the
presentation
on
the
nature
of
the
issue.
let
me
give
a
specific
example
on
which
i
think
this
would
probably
be
likely
to
occur
or
the
banking
agencies
have
indeed
a
long
time
experience
with
problems
of
bank
failure
and
imminent
bank
failure.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
experience,
their
judgment
as
to
whether
certain
factual
indication
suggests
the
likelihood
or
the
danger
of
bank
failure
would
i
suppose
be
entitled
to
be
listened
to
with
considerable
respect.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
in
the
abstract
mr.
justice
brennan
really
say
how
expertise
would
play
a
role
there.
now,
one
of
the
disputes
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
the
houston
case,
it's
sort
of
a
reverse
twist.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
normally
the
larger
bank
in
acquiring
the
smaller
bank,
the
argument
is
that
the
smaller
bank's
management
has
become
mediocre
and
did
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
other
way
around
in
the
houston
case.
but
this
is
a
factor
commonly
relied
on.
now,
this
incidentally
is
an
issue
of
substance
on
which
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
i
am
sure
that
we
and
the
banking
agencies
are
rather
going
to
--
are
going
to
rather
sharply
conflict
because
an
issue
we
will
always
raise
against
the
claim
of
that
kind
is
whether
the
merger
is
necessary
to
resolve
the
management
problem
that
has
been
relied
upon
by
the
comptroller.
there
are
other
ways
of
solving
management
problems,
and
we
think
it's
quite
appropriate
and
we'll
argue
in
any
proceeding
that
there
must
be
some
demonstration
that
there
was
no
other
solution
at
hand
which
was
likely
to
take
care
of
this.
but
this
again,
i
don't
want
to
argue
issues
of
this
kind.
i
think
it's
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
this
really
takes
me
into
the
--
into
what
i
think
is
the
heart
of
the
issue.
i
mean,
the
basic
claim
that
is
being
made
exclusively
by
the
appellees
now
in
the
provident
case
or
by
the
comptroller's
office
is
that
what
is
involved
here
are
issues
which
are
just
not
suitable
for
determination
by
the
court.
now
i
think
really
the
argument
breaks
down
into
two
parts,
first
that
the
banking
agencies
have
greater
expertise
in
assessing
the
various
factual
issues
that
might
come
up
under
the
bank
merger
act
standard.
and
second
on
an
issue
i
think
should
be
kept
apart
and
i
certainly
will
discuss
it
but
i
want
to
set
it
aside
for
a
moment
that
the
balancing
of
competitive
considerations
against
convenience
and
needs
is
a
balancing
of
interest
that
is
somehow
ill-suited
to
court
determination.
now,
of
course,
we
see
no
force
in
either
of
these
contentions.
now,
with
regards
to
the
expertise
on
factual
issues,
i
think
in
view
of
what
the
statute
clearly
provides
in
our
view
and
what
the
legislative
history
indicates,
namely
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
congress,
that
the
court
shall
continue
to
exercise
their
functions
and
carry
on
an
independent
proceeding
here
and
make
an
independent
determination
that
it
will
not
do
simply
to
maintain
that
there
is
some
greater
expertise
on
the
--
in
part
of
the
agencies
that
has
to
be
shown
that
there's
some
reason
to
believe,
the
court
simply
cannot
handle
these
issues
and
we
do
not
think
that
is
so.
now,
let
me
just
go
into
some
of
the
issues
that
may
be
raised,
we
believe
that
most
if
not
all
of
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
thank
you.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
again
briefly
recapitulate,
i'm
now
taking
up
the
question
whether
the
courts
are
so
incapacitated
for
dealing
with
the
kinds
of
issues
that
are
involved
in
proceedings
of
this
kind
that
despite
what
we
think
is
the
plain
meaning
of
a
statute
and
the
plain
implication
of
legislative
history,
this
court
should
read
in
a
review
standard
of
some
kind
and
needless
to
say
we
think
the
courts
clearly
are
not.
there
are,
as
i
suggested
really
two
issues
here
or
it
breaks
down
into
two
parts.
one,
whether
the
banking
agencies
have
a
greater
expertise
or
--
let
me
put
it
differently,
whether
the
courts
lack
expertise
in
assessing
the
various
factual
issues
that
might
come
up.
and
second,
whether
the
balancing
of
considerations
that
might
be
involved
under
the
bank
merger
act
statute
is
so
wholly
unsuited
to
courts
that
to
impose
it
on
them
would
raise
something
akin
to
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
would
--
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
answer
that
in
general
without
reference
to
particulars.
i
don't
--
and
i
also
must
myself
confess
considerable
amount
of
ignorance
on
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
think
it
would
be
admissible
at
least
certainly
if
they
call
these
people
to
testify
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
which
they
would
probably
do,
would
they?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
it
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
answer
that
question
precisely.
i
think
substantially
the
answer
is
yes,
or
put
it
this
way,
the
what
--
the
way
you
put
the
position
is
substantially
correct.
i
think
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
has
no
impact
or
would
have
no
impact.
let
me
suppose
for
example
that
the
facts
brought
out
in
the
judicial
proceeding
more
or
less
correspond
to
those
that
were
developed
by
the
comptroller
and
were
a
part
of
his
record.
and
let
us
further
suppose
that
on
some
of
those
issues,
some
of
those
factual
questions
say
for
example,
on
the
likelihood
of
bank
failure
or
risk
of
bank
failure,
his
expertise
would
deserve
considerable
recognition.
then
i
can
envisage
a
situation
in
which
--
if
the
court
was
so
to
speak
on
the
race
(inaudible),
it
more
or
less,
the
facts
were
not
reasonably
in
dispute
and
the
judgment
of
the
comptroller
was
that
the
acquired
bank
was
going
to
fail,
the
judge
might
go
he
himself
would
not
--
might
have
some
doubt
on
this,
would
pay
some
regard
to
this.
but
i
think
in
short,
that
the
role
of
the
expertise
of
the
banking
agency
would
apply
is
not
something
that
can
be
answered
generally.
i
think
it
cannot
be
answered
easily
out
of
the
context
of
the
specific
issues
that
any
particular
case
raises.
and
to
go
back
to
your
question
again,
just
as
you're
saying,
is
it
generally
so
that
the
conclusion
of
the
comptroller
as
such
would
not
be
entitled
away,
i
think
i
would
again
be
inclined
to
say
yes,
that
is
our
position.
i
don't
see
how
--
i
think
it
is
that
it
derives
from
our
position
really
that
what
is
involved
here
is
an
independent
determination
by
the
courts
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
now,
to
get
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
the
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
which
--
and
again,
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
again,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
cripple
with
my
friends
on
the
other
side.
this
position
is
the
position
the
government
has
consistently
taken
below.
let
me
just
quote
briefly
from
our
brief
in
houston,
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
quote
page
8
of
the
brief,
"plaintiff
does
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
1966
act
has
no
relevance
in
this
lawsuit
or
has
no
way
affected
the
fair
existing
law.
the
66
act
affects
prior
law
in
two
ways.
one,
it
sets
forth
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
banking
agencies.
and
two,
directs
that
the
court
apply
those
same
standards.
now
i
have
further
citations
from
our
briefs
and
filings
in
both
courts
below
but
the
chart
of
it
is
we
--
well,
our
position
is
that
what
the
bank
merger
act
has
done
has
modified
and
supplied
a
new
set
of
standards,
the
precise
(inaudible)
meaning
of
which
is
yet
to
be
determined
in
the
cases
that
come
up
and
in
specific
context
but
which
leaves
unimpaired
and
unlimited
in
any
substantial
way
the
role
of
the
court
in
deciding
the
issues
laid
before
it
and
making
the
conclusion
of
the
statute
that
directs
it
to
make
is
correct.
now,
and
with
regard
to
the
kinds
of
issues
as
i
were
saying,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
the
issues
that
have
been
mentioned
in
the
appellee's
brief
in
this
case
and
the
comptroller's
brief
esoteric
as
they
may
sound
in
a
way
they
were
put
can
all
be
translated
into
issues
which
are
the
kinds
of
issues
that
the
courts
have
repeatedly
dealt
with
in
antitrust
cases.
the
courts
have
long
dealt
with
all
manner
of
issues
bearing
on
the
competitive
consequences
of
mergers.
they
have
dealt
with
problems
of
market
definition
in
both
the
product
and
geographical
sense
and
some
industries
where
that
problem
of
market
definition
is
at
least
equally
as
complex
as
it
is
in
banking.
they
have
dealt
with
claims
that
a
merger
will
have
pro-competitive
consequences
by
providing
a
stronger
competitor
for
existing
larger
companies,
by
permitting
economies
of
scale,
by
providing
a
full
line
of
products
and
the
like.
the
courts
have
had
issues
like
this
before
them
an
antitrust
cases
whether
the
courts
in
any
particular
case
have
concluded
that
these
are
relevant
or
not
is
another
question,
but
they
are
not
issues
that
are
foreign
to
the
court.
now
as
i
said,
i
think
all
of
the
factors
that
have
been
cited
are
translatable
in
the
issues
of
this
kind
and
let
me
just
take
for
you
two
or
three
of
the
examples.
our
frequent
allegation
is
that
the
merged
institution
will
be
able
to
provide
services
which
neither
existing
bank
could
supply
or
could
supply
them
more
efficiently.
now,
you
can't
evaluate
a
claim
of
this
kind
except
in
terms
of
the
market
concerned
by
asking
for
whom
those
services
are
intended,
whether
those
customers
can
currently
get
them
from
other
sources,
that
is
to
say
whether
other
banks
providing
them,
and
whether
the
addition
of
another
supplier
which
allegedly
the
numerous
bank,
would
they,
will
or
will
not
materially
improve
the
competitive
performance
of
the
market.
this
is
true
for
example
of
the
issue
raised
by
the
appellee
banks
here.
they
claim
that
the
merged
bank
will
be
able
to
provide
a
wider
trust
service.
now
the
significance
of
that
can
only
be
evaluated
by
asking
how
many
other
sources
of
trust
service
are
there
in
philadelphia.
how
significant
would
the
addition
of
this
bank
--
of
this
further
bank
be
assuming
it
would
be
able
to
do
better
merged
than
unmerged.
let
me
take
the
question,
the
issue
which
is
commonly
relied
on
by
the
banking
agencies
in
approving
these
mergers
that
the
merged
bank
will
have
a
larger
loan
limit.
and
therefore,
will
become
an
additional
participant
in
the
large
loan
market.
now
this
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
the
merger
will
add
a
competitor
in
the
large
loan
market
and
again
the
question
is
how
important
is
this?
and
i
may
say
parenthetically
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
have
take
--
we
have
made
the
guess
and
the
prediction
that
the
bank
merger
act
will
not
substantially
affect
results
in
these
cases
is
that
by
and
large
as
indeed
parts
of
the
comptrollers'
opinions
point
out,
the
large
loan
market
by
and
large
is
already
a
highly
competitive
market
in
a
higher
numbers
of
banks
from
coast
to
coast
participate
so
that
normally
the
addition
of
one
more
bank
that
can
loan
$10
million
as
compared
with
six,
is
that
adding
any
bank
in
which
there
are
already
a
large
number
of
sources
competing
vigorously
for
that
kind
of
loan.
let
me
give
you
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
that,
would
be
an
aspect
of
the
question
that
i
have
just
read.
i
mean,
the
argument
could
be
made
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
even
though
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
oh
no,
the
courts,
i
am
sure,
i
cannot
pull
off
the
top
of
my
head
an
example
but
i'm
sure
that
in
the
past,
in
evaluation
of
competition
involves
--
and
valuation
of
service
as
well
as
price,
and
location
and
convenience
as
well
as
price.
and
of
course,
if
the
claim
is
made
that
the
addition
of
a
local
source
for
a
large
loan
is
significant,
you
--
this
is
a
factual
issue
which
you
can
get
at.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
commonly
argued
or
i'm
a
--
i
rather
suspect
assume
that
this
is
indeed
significant,
and
if
my
memory
is
correct,
there
was
testimony
by
some
businessmen
in
the
earlier
philadelphia
national
bank
case
that
indeed
having
a
local
bank
capable
of
19
large
loans
would
be
advantageous.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
a
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
this
is
an
issue
i
want
to
take
up
directly
in
just
a
moment.
this
is
another
aspect
i
think
of
the
same
claim.
now
again,
without
wanting
to
argue
the
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
poses
a
simpler
--
that
poses
a
fact
question,
the
testimony
of
these
people
can
be
evaluated.
it
may
not
be
worth
very
much.
i
have
here
for
example
an
interim
report
of
pennsylvania
banking
law
commission
which
asks
for
economists
to
study
the
banking
system
in
pennsylvania
and
what
should
have
done
about
it.
and
on
this
particular
issue,
one
of
the
economists,
professor
philips
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
says
there
is
little
evidence
beyond
that's
found
in
direct
support
of
merger
application
citing
the
philadelphia
bank
case
that
large
borrowers
are
in
fact
inconvenienced
by
having
to
rely
on
banks
in
other
cities.
shopping
for
large
loans
is
not
uncommon
and
the
incremental
cost
to
borrowers
--
of
contracting
banks
in
other
cities
are
negligible.
it
is
undemonstrated
and
improbable
if
the
industrial
growth
of
the
state
is
in
any
appreciable
way,
adversely
affected
by
the
absence
of
multibillion
dollar
commercial
banks.
now,
i
offer
that
again,
not
as
proof
of
the
proposition
but
simply
to
suggest
that
the
issue
that's
posed
there
is
one
(inaudible)
in
the
competence
and
familiarity
of
the
courts.
now,
the
example
i
was
about
to
get
to
which
i
think
boils
down
to
this
issue,
is
a
claim
that
--
to
rely
it
on
the
houston
case
that
the
increased
size
of
this
bank
will
contribute
to
growth
and
employment,
in
this
case
in
the
houston
area.
the
comptroller
--
and
i
quote
said
in
his
opinion,
"the
failure
of
the
houston
banks
to
keep
paced
with
the
growth
of
its
area
has
led
to
unfortunate
results.
cities
with
more
satisfactory
banking
facilities
can
attract
industry
which
needs
large
scale
financing.
moreover,
many
local
projects
are
simply
unable
to
obtain
financing
due
to
the
preference
of
large
banks
in
other
areas
for
projects
in
those
areas."
no
evidence
was
cited
to
support
these
conclusions.
and
interestingly
enough,
later
on
in
the
comptroller's
opinion
and
this
appears
on
page
115
of
our
brief,
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
relevant
market,
the
comptroller
says,
"banks
in
new
york,
boston,
chicago,
and
dallas
and
the
west
coast
entered
the
houston
area
and
obtained
sizable
loans."
in
1957
federal
reserves
study
for
example
report
that
new
york
banks
alone
held
$375
million
of
loans
to
houston
borrowers,
the
largest
amount
of
out-of-city
loans
made
by
new
york
banks
that
year.
this
intense
competition
from
out
of
state
bank
has
not
evaded
over
the
years
but
has
in
fact
increased
in
vigor.
now,
whether
the
comptroller
was
right
in
the
first
place
or
in
the
second
place
again
is
not
an
issue,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
issue
as
presented
is
not
one
so
esotery
that
it
cannot
be
dealt
with
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
claim
that
the
requirement
of
the
statute
that
the
court
may
have
to
balance,
convenience
and
needs
or
probable
effects
on
convenience
and
needs
against
any
competitive
consequences,
somehow
imposes
upon
the
court
a
burden
which
is
so
foreign
to
foreign
to
it
that
it
raises
serious
constitutional
questions
as
to
the
appropriate
division
of
legislative
and
judicial
responsibility.
i'm
frank
to
say
that
we
have
great
difficulty
understanding
the
courts
with
this
argument
because
what
it's
really
saying
is
that
courts
cannot
weigh
and
balance
conflicting
interest.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
--
i
will
give
some
specific
examples
mr.
justice
of
cases
that
have
arisen
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
in
which
people
are
certainly
endeavored
to
get
the
court
to
balance
and
wherein
fact
the
court
has
or
has
not
depending
upon
whether
the
claim
is
an
appropriate
one.
we
gave
in
our
--
and
in
antitrust
law
generally,
one
example
we
gave
is
the
court's
opinion
in
the
tampa
electric
case
involving
the
validity
of
the
requirements
contract
and
the
court
specifically
said
that
in
view
of
the
economic
benefits
to
both
parties
involved
in
requirements
contracts
that
the
rule
or
rather
harsh
rule
applicable
to
time
clauses
would
not
be
applicable
to
requirements
contracts,
even
though
the
economic
consequence,
and
say,
in
the
sense
of
foreclosure
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
now,
let
me
go
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
it
may
require
a
different
balance.
let
me
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
to
what's
appropriate,
that
is
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
let
me
--
yes.
let
me
give
a
specific
example.
it
has
been
held
at
least,
by
at
least
one
district
court
and
i
think
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
rule
on
it
at
least
in
dictum,
that
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
if
there
are
anticompetitive
consequences
from
a
merger
in
any
one
line
of
commerce
that
alleged
pro-competitive
benefits
in
another
line
that
may
be
affected
by
the
merger
are
irrelevant,
that
is
that
the
court
in
--
because
of
the
statute
cannot
offset
one
against
the
other.
it
seems
clear
that
to
us,
under
the
bank
merger
act
that
this
particular
rule
would
not
be
appropriate
in
bank
mergers.
banks
indeed
do
have
effects
on
several
different
lines
of
commerce
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
phrase,
if
that
--
to
give
effect
to
the
proposition
that
convenience
and
needs
made
at
some
time
clearly
outweigh
anticompetitive
effects.
but
that
is
one
of
the
circumstances
in
which
a
court
might
reach
that
kind
of
a
decision.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
decision
under
section
7
as
it
stands
depends
upon
the
language
of
that
act.
and
i
have
never
heard
anybody
suggest
that
there
would
be
anything
unconstitutional
for
the
court
to
have
reached
a
different
decision,
namely
to
say
that
in
evaluating
a
merger,
pro-competitive
consequences
in
one
line
may
be
offset
against
anticompetitive
consequences
as
a
--
in
another.
this
decision
was
an
interpretation
of
a
statute.
and
as
i
say,
i
never
heard
it
suggested
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
it
were
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
court
to
reach
a
different
result.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
that's
my
impression
of
what
their
argument
is
that
it
is
not
appropriate
for
a
court
to
make
decisions
of
this
kind.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
with
the
argument
is
that
the
banks
and
the
comptroller
have
described
what
i
would
call
simply
factual
issues
as
policy
issues.
let
me
give
you
an
example
from
the
appellees'
brief
in
the
provident
case
on
page
30,
they
say,
"in
the
final
analysis,
public
interest
means
what
is
good
for
the
community.
do
the
business
and
financial
institutions
in
the
community
need
banks
with
larger
lending
loans?
would
new
businesses
be
attracted
if
the
banks
in
the
community
offered
more
sophisticated
services?
would
the
merged
institution
as
the
trustees
to
attract
specialized
personnel?
will
it
be
efficient
enough
to
afford
them?
will
improvement
in
its
services
stimulates
its
competitors
to
improve
their
services?
these
are
the
questions
that
must
be
answered
and
then
they
say
these
are
preeminently
legislative
in
nature.
and
i
would
say
that's
a
mischaracterization.
they're
essentially
factual
in
nature.
and
that
the
kinds
of
factual
issues
that
the
courts
as
i
say
have
dealt
with
in
antitrust
law
repeatedly
and
it
seems
to
me
it
has
never
been
seriously
argued
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
balance
competing
interests.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
they
have
recourse,
i'd
--
i
think
under
the
general
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
hobbs
act
that
is
for
review
of
agency
determinations
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
of
the
statute
i
believe
mr.
metzger
was
describing.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
there
are
the
--
there
the
standard
would
be
in
a
court,
i
think
this
is
a
provision
that's
applicable.
it's
5
u.s.c.
706
--
well,
702
grants
the
right
of
review.
a
person
suffering
legal
wrong
because
of
agency
action
are
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
is
entitled
to
judicial
review.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
it's
sort
of
a
catch
all.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
then
706,
the
standard
is
as
follows.
the
reviewing
court
shall
compel
agency
action
unlawfully
withheld
or
unreasonably
delayed
and
hold
unlawful
and
set
aside
conclusions
found
to
be
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
abuse
of
discretion
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law,
and
unwarranted
by
the
facts
to
the
extent
that
the
facts
are
subject
to
trial
de
novo.
this
was
the
statute
involved
in
the
smithfield
case.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
the
short
of
it
is
that
if
the
agency
turns
them
down,
this
is
the
only
out
from
their
review
and
it
is
that
--
it
is
of
--
it
is
an
agency
review
test.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
and
that
of
course
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
it
could
be
argued
this
way
mr.
justice
fortas,
and
indeed
that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
comptroller
would
wish
you
to
adopt.
let
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
just
simply
say
that
the
two
situations
are
not
symmetrical
and
that
a
symmetrical
solution
therefore
is
not
appropriate.
the
mere
--
in
other
words,
i
see
no
good
reason
why
somebody
who
losses
on
the
merger
application
if
he
is
limited
to
a
review
for
abuse
of
discretion
is
necessarily
means
in
the
absence
of
any
statutory
declaration
to
the
contrary
that
the
antitrust
laws
should
be
repealed
in
their
application
to
merger's
that
are
approved.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
i,
--
my
comment
was
made
advisably
because
i
think
it
does
involve
or
repeal
the
antitrust
laws.
if
you
adopt
--
if
you
interpret
review
de
novo
to
be
coterminous
with
the
kind
of
review
that's
provided
in
the
hobbs
act,
or
agency
is
upset
only
if
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
findings
or
if
the
discretion
has
been
abused.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
sets
aside
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
then
it
comes
back
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
to
the
kinds
of
considerations
that
we
endeavored
to
put
forward
earlier.
i
mean,
i
have
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
congress
could
have
done
this.
there
were
several
bills
proposed
which
would
have
the
bill
that
was
proposed
--
that
was
finally
passed
provide
that
there'll
be
an
antitrust
proceeding,
directed
the
court
to
apply
that
same
standard,
as
that
with
the
agencies
apply,
as
a
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
court
wants
uniformity
as
among
agencies
and
between
agencies
in
the
court.
and
we
would
simply
say
again
that
we
don't
think
the
statute
that's
worded
in
this
way
is
appropriately
interpreted
by
virtue
of
focus
on
this
phrase
review
de
novo
which
incidentally
we
propose
to
have
this
rather
an
amazing
effect.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
--
i,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
can't
disagree
that
that's
the
issue.
that
is
the
issue
and
i
--
our
own
feeling
is
that
everything
points
against
that
kind
of
a
result.
again,
i'm
not
suggesting
for
the
moment
that
the
congress
could
not
have
(inaudible)
done
this.
but
there
are
very
clear
ways
of
doing
it.
and
there
were
bills
before
congress
which
would've
clearly
done
it
in
the
traditional
usual
way.
and
i
guess
what
we're
really
saying
is
that
the
phrase
review
de
novo
as
it
appears
in
this
statute
simply
will
not
bear
the
weight
of
a
conclusion
which
amounts
to
repeal
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
don't
think
anybody
is
given
the
final
authority
to
determine
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
difficult
situation
is
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
set
aside,
that
there's
a
paramount
consequence
set
aside.
the
icc
can
approve
a
railroad
merger
even
though
it
has
anticompetitive
consequences
which
would
clearly
amount
to
a
violation
not
only
to
the
clayton
act
but
to
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
mergers
of
the
railroads,
mergers
of
trucks,
and
the
like.
the
anti
--
the
department
of
justice,
the
only
role
which
it
performs
is
an
intervener
before
the
agency
endeavoring
to
persuade
it,
not
to
approve
the
merger
if
it
doesn't
think
so.
but
if
the
agency
does,
the
avenues
opened
for
attacking
the
act
are
severely
limiting.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
they're
limited
in
that,
the
agency's
determination,
if
based
on
substantial
evidence
and
based
on
proper
procedures
and
if
they
handle
the
issues
right
as
a
matter
of
law
is
final
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
we
think
clearly
not
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
clearly
not,
clearly
not.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
our
position.
and
we
don't
see
any
good
reason
for
stretching.
there
is
no
problem
posed
for
a
court
here
that
is
so
insurmountable
or
even
close
to
it
that
there
is
a
reason
for
this
court
to
stretch
to
go
--
to
read
a
review
standard
into
this
legislation.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
as
mr.
justice
fortas
said,
of
course
the
federal
trade
commission
has
dual
jurisdiction
with
us
over
the
range
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
the
range
of
antitrust
law
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
that
being
subject
to
review.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes
sir
they
do.
they
have
hearings.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right,
that's
correct,
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
move
on
if
i
may
to
the
last
issue
which
is
short
of
the
issue
of
the
stay
which
i
--
well,
i
think
will
only
take
a
couple
of
minutes,
and
that
is
the
question
whether
if
we
are
right
so
far,
meaning
that
there
should
be
no
review
standard,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue
of
convenience
and
needs.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no,
there's
virtually
no
record
on
the
stay
motions,
the
parties
in
both
cases
put
in
extensive
submissions
of
affidavits
in
factual
assertions.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
no.
the
--
well
in
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
provident
case,
there
were
more
extensive
proceedings
that
is
there
were
more,
that
the
case
got
farther
along
in
the
pretrial
stage
than
it
had
in
houston.
in
that,
the
judge
first
declare
--
overruled
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
a
pleading
question
and
then
there
was
a
pretrial
and
the
court
indicated
what
he
thought
the
government
had
to
prove
in
order
to
sustain
it's
case
and
it
came
out
in
the
course
of
our
various
submissions
that
we
were
not
prepared
and
we
did
not
believe
we
had
to
assume
the
burdens
which
has
pretrial
order
indicated
--
he
thought
which
he
had
assumed.
and
it
was
because
of
that,
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
were
removed
and
the
judge
then
granted
the
motion.
now
on
the
burden
of
proof,
i
would
again
point
to
the
language
of
the
statute
and
what
we
think
is
the
plain
implication
of
the
house
report
and
was
pertinent
legislative
history
indicating
that
what
was
created
here
substantially
was
an
exception,
the
ordinary
antitrust
principles
and
we
think
by
all
ordinary
standards
where
someone
is
claiming
the
benefit
of
an
exception,
it
is
up
to
them
to
plead
it
and
to
assume
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
issue.
i
will
quote
briefly
from
the
house
report.
it
says,
"the
bill
acknowledges
that
the
general
principle
or
the
antitrust
laws
that
substantially
anticompetitive
mergers
are
prohibited
applies
to
banks."
but
permits
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
applies
to
banks
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
reading
from
the
house
report.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
which
accompanied
the
final
bill.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
but
permits
an
exception
in
cases
where
it
is
clearly
shown
that
a
merger
is
so
beneficial
to
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
to
permit
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
that's
(inaudible).
now
of
course,
we
are
not
totally
unaware
of
the
elements
of
the
defense
--
what
the
defense
is
likely
to
be.
we
have
seen
the
submission
that
the
banks
have
made
to
the
--
proving
banking
agencies.
we
have
seen
sometimes
as
opinions.
sometimes
the
opinions
don't
come
out
till
after
we
file
our
case.
so
we
are
totally
unaware
but
it
seems
to
us
that
this
hardly
indicates
that
we
should
assume
the
burden
of
pleading
and
alleging
the
negative,
namely
that
there
are
no
convenience
and
needs
to
be
served
which
would
clearly
outweigh
the
competitive
considerations,
because
the
parties
are
clearly
free
to
drop
issues
they
have
raised,
to
raise
new
ones,
and
at
best
would
be
wasteful
to
compel
the
government
to
try
to
go
around
refuting
in
advance
claims
that
they
don't
even
know
will
be
made.
the
last
point
i
want
to
make
is
with
regard
to
the
stay
and
i
will
just
refer
you
i
think
to
our
brief
in
which
to
be
set
forth
in
some
detail
the
reasons
why
we
believe
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
us,
that
these
complaints
should
not
have
been
dismissed,
you
should
rule
that
the
statutory
stay
provided
for
in
the
bank
merger
act
automatically
revives.
we
of
course
are
not
contending
that
the
stay
--
that
the
--
that
you
should
decide
right
now
that
that
stay
should
stay
in
effect
forever.
on
remand,
the
parties
would
be
free
to
renew
their
motions
for
dissolution
of
a
statutory
stay.
we
--
our
contention
is
that
the
whole
tenure
of
the
act
which
is
entitled
a
view
to
prevent
the
need
for
dissolution
of
banks
indicates
that
this
statutory
stay
is
not
to
be
dissolved
except
on
a
very
heavy
showing
on
the
part
of
defendants.
and
here,
the
statutory
stays
were
dissolved
not
on
the
basis
of
any
showing
of
that
kind
but
concomitantly
with
the
dismissal
of
the
complaints.
and
if
this
court
should
rule
of
the
dismissal
was
inappropriate,
we
think
the
stay
should
revive.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there's
only
one
issue
that
we
care
to
comment
on
any
further
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
i
believe
that
all
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
as
to
just
how
a
review
procedure
suggested
by
the
appellees
in
these
cases
would
work
opposes
the
issue
very
sharply
as
to
whether
a
statute
like
the
one
we
have
here
really
contemplates
what
they
suggest.
mr.
ballard
and
the
comptroller
in
various
ways
attempt
to
resolve
the
questions
that
are
raised.
how
many
props
have
to
be
knocked
out
before
the
commission
--
for
the
agency's
opinion
is
to
be
set
aside?
what
if
the
bank
gives
new
reasons
not
given
before
--
not
put
before
the
agency?
what
if
the
government
puts
in
rebuttal
evidence
which
is
not
before
the
agency?
should
there
be
remand?
if
so,
when?
if
the
court
makes
its
own
determination
of
the
underlying
facts,
how
can
it
tell
whether
the
comptroller
abused
his
discretion?
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
these
problems
are
not
soluble.
this
court
in
the
end
could
determine
the
circumstances
in
which
remand
was
to
be
made
when
the
comptroller's
opinion
should
go
down.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
court
would
have
to
construct
a
detailed
set
of
review
procedure,
a
detailed
set
of
rules
governing
how
these
cases
would
be
disposed
of
and
that
these
seems
wholly
inappropriate
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
to
base
on
the
kind
of
the
statute
that
we
have
here.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes
you
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
as
i
say,
you
can
answer
the
question.
i'm
not
saying
the
questions
cannot
be
answered.
you
can
adopt.
you
could
lift
over
by
the
way,
the
procedures
set
forth
although
there
are
some
unresolved
issues
on
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
suggested
by
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
the
issue
we'll
put
and
we
simply
feel
on
the
basis
of
what
transpired
leading
up
to
this
legislation,
what
the
act
says,
consequent
reference
to
antitrust
proceeding,
the
fact
that
indeed
the
issues
raised
are
not
as
(inaudible)
as
arcane
if
they
might
have
first
like
--
seemed
to
be.
all
of
these
goes
to
suggest
that
--
whereas
indeed
that
solution
is
possible
that
is
not
appropriate.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
not
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
the
cases
know
how
would
come
out.
smithfield
in
fact
raises
some
rather
difficult
problems
which
i
think
judge
sobeloff's
dissent
alludes
to.
to
my
knowledge
and
my
knowledge
unfortunately
is
quite
well
on
this,
there
--
this
is
an
issue
that
has
not
been
settled.
in
these
(inaudible),
i
can
make
guesses.
but
in
the
statute
which
says
that
you
can
only
overturn
the
decision
that
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
if
it
is
the
kind
of
issue
which
was
normally
entrusted
to
the
agency
and
not
normally
made
by
the
judge,
i
suppose
you
find
facts
were
on
--
you
sent
it
back
and
have
him
try
again.
i
must
say
however
--
i
should
add
in
connection
with
the
comptroller's
and
the
other
banking
agencies
power
to
approve
that
they
can
and
have
disapproved
mergers
from
many
reasons
other
than
anticompetitive
consequences.
in
fact,
only
two
mergers
out
of
the
140
that
have
transpired
since
the
statute
has
passed
have
been
disapproved
and
they
have
been
disapproved
for
reasons
other
than
anticompetitive
consequences.
so,
what
he
--
or
the
approval
in
other
words,
the
approval
power
and
the
power
to
disapprove
is
not
coterminous
with
the
antitrust
or
even
with
--
coterminous
with
the
bank
merger
act.it
goes
well
beyond
that.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that
is
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
(voice
overlap)
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
on
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
hesitate
to
introduce
testimonial
evidence
before
this
court,
but
in
response
to
your
question
we
had
no
such
idea.
i
can't
--
if
we
had
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
we
would've
--
we
would
rapidly
substituted
some
other
language.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
afraid
--
mr.
justice
fortas
it
wasn't
even
that.
if
it
were
held
that
this
--
the
use
of
this
word
were
decisive
i
must
say
from
our
standpoint
it
wouldn't
--
would've
been
one
of
the
greatest
inadvertencies
in
history.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
trust
not.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes,
and
in
retrospect
--
in
view
of
the
facts,
you
would've
had
an
easier
time,
i
wished
we
had
used
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
might
think
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well,
i
think
it's
broader
than
that
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
most
of
the
usual
questions
you
asked,
when
you're
asked
where
should
the
burden
of
proof
lie
fall
in
our
favor
in
this
of
a
question.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
most
of
the
evidence
is
--
in
fact
all
of
it,
a
good
part
of
it
on
convenience
and
needs
is
within
the
hands
of
the
banks
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
and
he's
got
better
access
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
i
would
--
he
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
well
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
he
is
wrong
in
having
decided
that
there
were
pro-competitive
benefits.
it
would
still
be
open
to
the
courts
under
our
view
of
the
proceedings
that
are
involved,
namely
the
independent
determination
of
the
issue
if
they
--
if
the
evidence
so
convinced
the
court
to
find
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
that
the
merger
would
serve
convenience
and
needs
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
and
this
would
clearly
outweigh.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
in
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
that's
right.
now
needless
to
say
that,
well,
we
have
not
been
--
will
not
concede
and
will
endeavor
to
disapprove
the
contentions
that
they
make
on
the
convenience
and
needs
and
we
will
most
earnestly
cross-examine
witnesses
and
the
like
and
we
will
argue
eventually
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
convenience
and
needs
that
are
alleged.
but
i
--
as
i
said,
the
case
is
not
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
right.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
this
is
an
issue
that
i
had
not
really
thought
of.
i
take
it,
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
even
that
the
antitrust
proceeding
just
stops
at
that
point
because
the
comptroller's
approval
is
erroneous
and
therefore
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
there
is
no
valid
approval
to
permit
them
to
go
ahead
and
merge.
i
take
it
that's
what
--
mr.
donald
f.
turner
--
your
issue
--
your
point
is.
i
--
this
is
frankly
one
i
had
not
thought
of.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
the
disposition
of
this
case
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
dock
out
on
it.
mr.
donald
f.
turner
any
further
questions?
