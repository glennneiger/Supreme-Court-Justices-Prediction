justice
potter
stewart
the
court,
you're
talking
about
now
in
court?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
after
this
has
been
approved
by
the
relevant
agency.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
for
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
so-called
--
justice
potter
stewart
review
de
novo.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
it's
called
though,
and
that's
what
the
court
proceeding
is
called.
justice
potter
stewart
as
--
as
the
trial
court
have
original
jurisdiction
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
pleading
--
to
be
the
pleading
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
you
stated
a
cause
of
action
with
the
matter
of
pleadings.
justice
potter
stewart
but
also
prove
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
understood
his
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
understood
his
ruling
to
be
much
broader
than
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
nearly
that
you
had
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
technically
stated
a
cause
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
turner
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
is
a
review
procedure
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
more
or
less
conventional
kind,
then
i
suppose,
it'd
be
rather
clear
that
the
burden
is
on
the
government
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
the
jury
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
--
administrative
finding,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
or
was
capricious
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
a
trial
de
novo
anyway.
it
wasn't
reviewed
though,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
that's
only
the
commercial
banks
to
expand
the
goal
and
that's
constitutional
or
otherwise.
justice
potter
stewart
otherwise,
you
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
otherwise
you
would
include
steamships
and
steel
company
and
everything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
turner,
i
thought
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
much
earlier
in
today
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
conceded
that
it
was
an
error
to
call
it
a
section
7
proceeding
in
the
complaint
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart

kind
of

justice

(inaudible)
report
to
amend
section
7.
justice
potter
stewart

i
could
not
report
to
