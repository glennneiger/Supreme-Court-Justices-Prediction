justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
state
--
what
they
were?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
state
what
the
substantial
changes
were?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
would've
been
required
if
all
merger
illegal
before
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
already
entered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
another
step.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
only
real
basic
difference
between
you
and
the
government
on
that
is
that
they
agree
that
you've
got
to
weigh
it
and
balance,
they
claim
that
it's
your
burden
of
proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
they
claim
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendants?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
that
the
only
basic
difference
between
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
it's
in
the
language
in
the
bank
merger
act
which
supports
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
specifically
states
that
section
7
is
no
longer
to
be
applicable
to
bank
mergers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
does
it
say
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
the
logic,
what
language
is
in
the
act
or
in
the
report
of
the
committee,
it
said
the
long
established
used
of
the
application
of
section
7
of
the
bank
merger
was
to
be
repealed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
being
the
center
of
being
in
it
to
establish
an
entirely
new
procedure,
is
there
any
language
that
says
that
either
in
the
statute
or
in
the
report?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
shouldn't
it
have
said
it
if
the
section
7
was
to
be
done
away
with?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
it
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
had
section
7
been
used
with
reference
to
bank
mergers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
within
my
experience
as
to
some
extent,
i
thought
that
congress
decided
to
repeal
a
long
existing
statute
but
they
didn't
do
it
by
circumlocution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
logic,
but
did
it
by
language.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
repeal,
has
just
done
away
where
the
court
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
no
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
language
--
you
can't
cite
any
language
of
anybody
that
indicated
it
was
substituted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
that
ever
take
away
all
the
standards
of
section
7?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
take
away
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
in
sum
and
totally
is
that
this
act
did
away
with
the
antitrust
laws
application,
the
bank
merger
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
a
whole
except
as
covered
by
the
act
--
this
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
after
it's
covered
by
this
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
say
de
novo?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
de
novo
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
meaning
of
trial
de
novo?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
way
it's
treated
throughout
the
nation,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
through
trial
de
novo?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
a
trial
de
novo
of
the
case
coming
from
an
inferior
court,
of
a
county
to
the
circuit
court
of
the
county
finds
it,
what
is
a
trial
de
novo
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
just
as
though
there
had
been
no
trial
below.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
not
talking
about
constitutional
questions
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i'm
talking
about
what
those
words
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
found
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
go
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
go
about
testing
the
community
reaction
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
does
he
incline
with?
justice
hugo

black
how
did
he
get
beyond
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
banking
community?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
get
beyond
the
banking
fraternity's
reaction
to
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume,
he
makes
an
extensive
inquiry
among
the
prospective
borrowers
from
the
bank?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
those
that
associates
with
the
bank,
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
who
originally
proposed
the
language
review
de
novo?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
department
of
justice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
was
opposed
to
making
the
--
giving
a
comptroller
all
the
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
they
have
done?
would
they
have
given
the
comptroller
final
right
to
determine
the
banks
in
mergers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
the
object
which
the
counsel
assault
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
make
any
statements
about
his
position
on
mergers
before
the
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
provision
for
review
de
novo
to
the
product
of
the
department
of
justice's
effort
in
connection
with
those
bills?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
really
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
really
take
the
position
i
gather,
section
7
remains
in
effect
just
as
it
was
before,
but
that
the
court
in
determining
the
question
of
whether
its
been
violated,
takes
into
consideration
the
view
--
the
factors
of
the
michigan
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
courts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
still
have
that
function
to
perform?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
had
to
be
any
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
past
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
decisions
of
the
court
in
antitrust
cases,
the
balancing
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
the
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
act
do
anymore
than
refer
to
an
element
which
has
always
been
considered
by
the
courts?
i
don't
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
what
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say,
the
weight
to
be
given.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
any
language
appropriate
in
this
act
such
as
in
the
in
the
icc
and
ftc
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
compensates
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
stretch
what
is
found,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
its
power
in
connection
with
deciding
whether
the
antitrust
law
has
been
violated
given
to
any
agency,
without
some
kind
of
hearings
where
parties
can
be
heard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
hearings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
assume
you
wouldn't
be
--
suppose
the
government
wouldn't
assume
to
prove
whether
the
(inaudible)
saying
it
would
be
exactly
what
the
government
within
the
public
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
it
do
it?
how
did
it
get
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
get
back
to
the
burden
of
proof
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
finally
put
you
right
back
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
burden
it
is?
and
if
it's
the
--
if
it's
your
burden
the
court
was
wrong
in
dismissing
you,
wasn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
this,
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
main
purpose
of
this
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
not
to
provide
for
a
right
system
of
judicial
review
of
mergers
in
advance
of
their
completion
so
as
to
prevent
judicial
decrees
thereafter
to
apply
in
mergers
to
be
eliminated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that
seems
to
have
been
the
point
fit
in
the
purpose
of
the
bill
--
title
of
the
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said,
to
establish
a
procedure
for
the
review
of
the
old
bank
merger
so
as
to
eliminate
the
necessity
or
the
dissolution
of
merged
banks
and
for
the
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
be
the
argument
of
the
government
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
that
to
be
the
argument
of
the
government
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
quite
think
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
thought
they
admitted
that
the
new
act
made
it
necessary
to
consider
the
question
of
convenience
to
the
community
but
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
understood
your
constitutional
argument
to
be
this,
the
act
provides
that
after
having
found
--
have
an
anticompetitive
effects
unless
it
finds
that
the
anticompetitive
effect
was
to
pose
transaction
that
clearly
outweighed
public
interest
by
this
probable
effect
of
the
transaction,
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
do
i
understand
that
you're
saying
that
the
courts
are
judicially
incompetent
to
decide
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
incompetent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
judicially
incompetent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
be
delegated
to
the
comptroller?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
your
argument,
doesn't
do
any
good
to
give
the
court
a
review
on
that
point,
they
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
this
other
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suggested
by
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
state
--
what
they
were?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
state
what
the
substantial
changes
were?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
would've
been
required
if
all
merger
illegal
before
that?
justice

black
that
was
already
entered.
justice
hugo

black
and
then
another
step.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the

real
basic
difference
between
you
and
the
government
on
that
is
that
they
agree
that
you've
got
to
weigh
it
and

they
claim
that
it's
your
burden
of
proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
they
claim
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendants?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
that
the
only
basic
difference
between
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
it's
in
the
language
in
the

act
which
supports

that
it

but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
does
it
say
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
the
logic,
what
language
is
in
the
act
or
in
the
report
of
the
committee,
it
said
the
long
established
used
of
the
application
of
section

of
the

was
to
be
repealed.
justice

why
shouldn't

said
it

decisions
of
the
court
in
antitrust
cases,
the
balancing
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
the
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
act
do
anymore
than
refer
to
an
element
which
has
always
been
considered
by
the
courts?
i
don't
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
what
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say,
the
weight
to
be
given.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
any
language
appropriate
in
this
act
such
as
in
the
in
the
icc
and
ftc
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
compensates
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
stretch
what
is
found,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
its
power
in
connection
with
deciding
whether
the
antitrust
law
has
been
violated
given
to
any
agency,
without
some
kind
of
hearings
where
parties
can
be
heard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
hearings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
assume
you
wouldn't
be
--
suppose
the
government
wouldn't
assume
to
prove
whether
the
(inaudible)
saying
it
would
be
exactly
what
the
government
within
the
public
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
it
do
it?
how
did
it
get
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
get
back
to
the
burden
of
proof
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
finally
put
you
right
back
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
burden
it
is?
and
if
it's
the
--
if
it's
your
burden
the
court
was
wrong
in
dismissing
you,
wasn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
this,
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
main
purpose
of
this
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
not
to
provide
for
a
right
system
of
judicial
review
of
mergers
in
advance
of
their
completion
so
as
to
prevent
judicial
decrees
thereafter
to
apply
in
mergers
to
be
eliminated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that
seems
to
have
been
the
point
fit
in
the
purpose
of
the
bill
--
title
of
the
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said,
to
establish
a
procedure
for
the
review
of
the
old
bank
merger
so
as
to
eliminate
the
necessity
or
the
dissolution
of
merged
banks
and
for
the
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
be
the
argument
of
the
government
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
that
to
be
the
argument
of
the
government
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
quite
think
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
thought
they
admitted
that
the
new
act
made
it
necessary
to
consider
the
question
of
convenience
to
the
community
but
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
understood
your
constitutional
argument
to
be
this,
the
act
provides
that
after
having
found
--
have
an
anticompetitive
effects
unless
it
finds
that
the
anticompetitive
effect
was
to
pose
transaction
that
clearly
outweighed
public
interest
by
this
probable
effect
of
the
transaction,
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
do
i
understand
that
you're
saying
that
the
courts
are
judicially
incompetent
to
decide
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
incompetent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
judicially
incompetent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
be
delegated
to
the
comptroller?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
your
argument,
doesn't
do
any
good
to
give
the
court
a
review
on
that
point,
they
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
this
other
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suggested
by
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
