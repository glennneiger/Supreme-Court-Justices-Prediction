mr.
david
t.
searls
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
have
been
six
decisions
rendered
ever
since
the
passage
of
the
merger
--
bank
merger
act
of
1966
by
the
trial
courts,
the
federal
trial
courts.
each
of
those
six
decisions
is
contrary
to
an
adverse
to
the
government
in
this
case.
in
each
of
those
six
cases,
the
trial
judge
held
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
was
the
controlling
statute.
one
of
those
six
decisions
is
a
three-judge
court
by
--
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
one
circuit
judge
and
two
district
judges
sitting.
in
the
present
case,
the
suit
is
brought
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
the
trial
court
passed
strictly
on
pleading
a
question
because
the
only
issue
before
the
court
was
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
properly
so,
on
motion
to
dismiss,
the
only
question
is
does
the
pleading
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted.
as
a
matter
of
law,
does
it
state
a
cause
of
action?
so
the
trial
judge
as
the
learned
counsel
for
the
department
of
justice
have
conceded,
did
not
reach
the
question
as
to
the
weight
to
be
given,
the
comptroller's
opinion
and
decision.
the
trial
judge
was
merely
holding
in
this
case,
you
have
to
bring
the
case
under
the
bank
merger
of
1966.
you
have
to
allege
in
your
complaint
those
issues,
those
standards
which
make
up
the
test
or
the
bank
merger
of
1966.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
trial
judge
is
passing
on
a
pleading
question
and
we
have
setout
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
a
colloquy
between
the
court
and
the
counsel
for
the
department
of
justice.
the
court
said,
"well,
the
burden,
i
am
not
too
much
concerned
about
the
burden
of
proof,
but
as
to
what
is
actually
necessary
for
you
to
allege.
that
is
what
we
are
concerned
about
here."
the
court
rather
said,
"i
recognized
full
will
that
this
is
very
important
and
serious
litigation.
and
i
have
no
more
desire
than
judge
clarie
had
to
dispose
of
this
matter
on
a
matter
of
pleading.
normally
of
course
we
don't."
then
he
said
to
the
attorney
for
the
department
of
justice,
"the
defendants
and
the
intervener
as
i
understand
it,
such
authorities
are
here
seem
to
say,
that
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
allege,
(a),
that
the
effect
would
be
anticompetitive,
and
(b),
that
it
is
not
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
need.
it
seems
to
me
as
simple
as
that."
then
he
further
said,
"i
think
it
is
just
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
alleged
the
cause
of
action
or
if
you
ought
to
amend
and
undertake
to
do
so,
if
you
haven't
already
done
it."
the
trial
judge
almost
solicited
the
department
of
justice
in
this
case
to
come
forward
and
amend
the
complaint.
and
although
the
department
gave
no
indication
that
they
had
any
desire
to
amend,
when
the
trial
court
entered
this
judgment
of
dismissal,
he
gave
them
10
days
in
which
to
amend.
now
the
position,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
well
certainly
--
ordinarily,
the
burden
of
proof
follows
the
burden
of
pleading,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
does
not
necessarily
follow
and
this
court
has
held
that
it
does
not
necessarily
follow.
but
the
court
here
was
not
reaching
the
burden
of
proof.
that
would
not
more
properly
come
before
a
trial
judge
in
a
pretrial
hearing
or
on
the
trial
of
the
case.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
am
ought
to
view
in
the
light
of
these
few
authorities
which
we
have
at
this
time,
that
the
pact
of
1966
made
some
rather
substantial
changes
in
the
law.
i
understand
the
cases
to
hold
the
burden
to
be
on
the
plaintiff,
to
allege
and
prove
an
anticompetitive
effect
of
the
merger,
and
further
that
that
is
not
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
aspect
of
the
matter.
i
think
the
court
was
saying
under
these
authorities
which
you
have
submitted
to
them.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
to
allege
and
prove,
he
was
analyzing
those
authorities,
he
said
those
are
what
those
cases
hold.
but
he
said,
the
question
before
me
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
a
question
of
pleading,
have
you
alleged
sufficient
facts
for
stated
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
t.
searls
your
honor
i
don't
think
--
as
i
said
on
the
previous
page,
at
the
beginning
of
this
appendix,
the
court
said,
"well,
the
burden,
i
am
not
too
much
concerned
about
the
burden
of
proof
but
is
what
is
actually
necessary
for
you
to
allege?"
i
think
the
trial
court
only
determined
the
question
of
pleading,
what
was
necessary
to
allege.
but
he
analyzed
the
authorities
to
hold
that
the
burden
was
on
the
plaintiff
to
allege
and
prove.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
he
would
because
i
think
your
honor
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
in
this
case,
to
prove
both
of
the
standards
by
the
--
that
set
--
that
is
set
forth
in
the
test
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
mr.
david
t.
searls
not
the
burden
of
proof
in
our
case,
in
a
--
i
think
for
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
sustained,
it
is
only
a
matter
of
looking
at
the
complaint
and
saying,
"does
the
complaint
state
a
cause
of
action
an
--
as
a
matter
of
law."
in
view
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
does
this
complaint
state
a
cause
of
action?
i
think
that
was
the
only
issue
before
the
trial
court.
now,
your
honor
i
want
to
submit
that
the
position
taken
by
the
department
of
justice
before
your
honors
is
entirely
different
from
the
position
taken
in
these
six
cases
in
the
trial
court.
the
department
of
justice
has
taken
a
consistent
position
in
the
trial
court
that
section
7
governs
bank
merger
act
by
the
bank
mergers
even
since
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
position
that
they're
taking
in
the
trial
courts,
they
were
seeking
to
have
a
determination
such
as
was
obtained
in
philadelphia
national
bank,
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
did
not
in
any
way
change
the
substantive
standards
to
be
applied
in
a
suit
for
violation
of
the
antitrust
law,
this
court
so
held.
but
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960,
there
was
no
provision
that
the
department
of
justice
and
the
courts
had
to
follow
the
same
test
and
the
same
standards
that
the
comptroller
was
required
to
follow.
this
court
recognized
that
fact
to
be
true
and
said
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
did
not
change
the
substantive
test
to
be
applied
in
a
suit
claiming
a
violation
of
antitrust
laws.
that
was
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
the
passage
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
was
to
set
forth
and
provide
as
the
committee
stated
in
its
report
or
the
banking
committee
in
the
house.
the
bill
would've
established
a
single
set
of
standards
for
the
consideration
of
future
mergers
by
the
banking
supervisory
agencies,
the
department
of
justice,
and
the
courts.
and
what
was
this
single
set
of
standards?
the
court
said,
"it
would
include
both
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
competition
and
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community."
those
are
the
two
elements
that
make
up
the
test
and
we
submit
that
that
has
been
carried
forward
into
the
statute
of
--
it
was
finally
passed.
whether
they
say
these
cases
were
brought
in
the
trial
court
on
an
entirely
different
theory,
we
now
find,
the
counsel
for
the
department
of
justice
say
this
morning
and
also
yesterday,
that
we
do
belong
--
we
do
not
dispute,
the
bank
merger
specifies
the
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
district
court
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
brought
against
bank
mergers.
the
government
in
no
way
has
intended
to
dispute
this
by
drafting
its
complaint
in
terms
of
section
7.
but
if
--
then,
it's
further
said
yesterday
and
today,
if
any
court
had
merely
requested
us
to
amend
our
complaints
to
make
reference
to
the
bank
merger
act,
we
would
have
done
so.
but
what
was
the
--
what's
been
the
position
that's
been
taken
to
the
trial
courts
from
these
cases?
the
first
decision,
the
three-judge
court
case
in
california
rendered
before
this
suit
was
ever
filed,
the
crocker-anglo
case.
the
court
set
forth
what
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
was.
in
its
opinion,
the
court
said
it
is
the
government's
view
that
the
new
statute
made
no
substantial
change
in
the
law
or
standards
to
be
applied
in
passing
up
on
the
issues
here
presented.
the
government
puts
it
does
then,
it
quotes
the
government's
position.
it
is
of
course
the
essential
position
of
the
government
that
the
1966
amendment
to
the
bank
merger
act
has
not
resulted
in
substantial
change
in
substantive
antitrust
law
or
in
the
standards
used
by
the
courts
in
determining
the
legality
of
bank
mergers.
but
then
the
three-judge
court
in
california
said,
"we
find
no
difficulty
in
concluding
that
then
you
win
that
made
substantial
changes
in
the
substantive
law
and
in
the
standards
to
be
applied
in
this
case."
mr.
david
t.
searls
those
standards
were,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
yes
your
honor,
that
they
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
standard
was
a
substantial
listing
of
competition.
mr.
david
t.
searls
but
in
section
7,
the
clayton
act,
it
says
in
any
line
of
commerce,
the
phrase
in
any
line
of
commerce
was
left
out
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
and
the
congressional
history
discloses
that
it
was
intentionally
omitted
so
that
you
would
not
determine
the
competitive
impact,
say,
in
commercial
banking
as
your
honors
held
in
the
national
--
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
but
you
would
determine
the
competitive
impact
in
the
light
of
all
the
financial
institutions
which
might
be
competing
with
commercial
banks
such
as
mortgage
loans,
company
savings
loan,
associations
and
so
forth.
mr.
david
t.
searls
and
then
they
--
and
then
the
other
step
was
the
public
interest
provision
which
is
not
included
in
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
and
it
is
not
included
in
section
7
with
the
clayton
act.
and
that
is
whether
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
merger
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
and
then,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
said,
"in
every
case,
the
responsible
agency
shall
take
into
consideration
the
financial
and
managerial
resources
and
future's
prospects
of
the
existing
and
proposed
institutions
and
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served
and
further
provides
that
courts
should
follow
the
same
standards
in
a
suit
--
in
a
judicial
proceeding."
mr.
david
t.
searls
they
claim
it's
a
defensive
matter.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
they
say
that
you
have
to
raise
it
as
a
defense,
and
of
course
it
may
or
may
not
be
raised
as
a
defense
that
depends
--
its
optional
where
the
defendant
what
defense
will
they
raise
of
course.
and
i'm
won't
--
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
matter
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
is
one
of
the
basic
differences
i'd
say
your
honor.
we
say
section
7
has
no
application
because
the
substantive
standards
of
section
7
are
no
longer
to
be
applied.
mr.
david
t.
searls
as
far
as
substantive
law
is
concerned.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
that's
true.
not
just
the
admission
of
any
in
line
of
commerce,
but
also
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
--
the
addition
of
the
convenience
and
needs.
mr.
david
t.
searls
section
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
is
--
we
take
that
position
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
could
be
in
any
inquiry
into
the
line
of
commerce.
mr.
david
t.
searls
in
section
1
because,
i
think
section
1
is
supplanted
in
bank
merger
cases
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
just
like
the
section
7
is.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes
sir,
but
the
congressional
history
shows
your
honor
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
in
section
1.
well,
of
course
that
does
not
appear
in
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
but
the
congressional
history
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
discloses
that
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce
were
intentionally
omitted
from
the
statute.
now
as
i've
said,
the
position
taken
here,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
is
not
applicable
is
different
from
what
--
before
the
trial
courts
when
they
rendered
these
six
decisions.
just
right
--
were
said
in
the
crocker-anglo
case,
the
government
took
the
position,
well,
there
is
no
substantial
difference
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
section
7
is
still
applicable.
now
in
the
saint
louis
bank
merger
case,
the
trial
court
as
here
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
and
in
the
saint
louis
bank
case,
the
court
said
the
plaintiff,
that
is
the
department
of
justice,
takes
the
position
of
the
sherman
and
clayton
acts
are
still
the
only
statutes
applicable
to
this
suit
and
that
bam
of
1966
has
an
effect
upon
the
comptroller.
in
other
words,
in
the
saint
louis
case,
the
trial
judge
said
that's
the
position
of
the
government,
the
bma
--
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
has
an
effect
only
upon
the
comptroller.
but
as
far
as
the
judicial
proceeding
is
concerned,
it
is
only
a
section
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
which
were
applicable.
and
i
on
this
case,
the
trial
court
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss
stating
that
the
plaintiff's
complaint
does
not
beat
--
meet
the
basic
minimum
standards
of
notice
pleading
in
that
it
has
not
alleged
a
violation
of
bma
66,
the
act
that
applies
to
all
bank
mergers.
so
the
court
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
complaint
in
this
case
--
the
bank
--
in
the
saint
louis
case
had
gave
the
government
20
days
in
which
to
amend
and
just
to
say
it
failed
and
refused
to
amend
in
this
case,
they
have
failed
and
refused
to
amend
in
the
saint
louis
case.
now,
in
the
provident
bank
case
in
philadelphia
which
will
follow
this
case
in
argument,
the
trial
judge
said
the
court
therefore
finds
that
since
justice
has
definitelyrefused
to
try
its
case
under
bma
66,
the
bank
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
expense
and
inconvenience
of
a
trial
when
the
justice
refused
to
prove
other
than
admitted
facts
to
establish
its
case.
and
likewise
in
the
present
case,
the
trial
judge
here
says,
"i
get
the
impression
you
don't
really
want
to
amend
and
if
you
don't
want
to
amend,
if
you
want
to
stand
on
this
one
proposition
so
that
justice
under
clayton
7
will
still
control
mergers
or
any
mergers
of
banks.
anyone
would
say
that
you
didn't
overlook
this
allegation
regarding
to
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
inadvertently
or
accidentally,
it's
intentionally.
and
so
in
this
complaint
as
before
your
honors
here
and
the
--
which
is
the
same
complaint
as
before
the
trial
court
of
course,
they
have
alleged,
and
this
complaint
appears
in
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief.
they
have
sought
to
enjoin
this
bank
merger
as
a
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
under
the
heading,
the
offense
charged,
they
have
alleged,
it
appears
on
page
75
of
the
government's
brief.
they
have
alleged
in
regard
to
the
offense
charge
that
the
two
banks
have
entered
into
an
agreement
of
merger
and
that
such
agreement
is
violative
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
in
the
prayer,
they
had
asked
that
the
court
adjudicate
that
supposed
merger
violates
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
there
is
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
in
their
complaint.
there's
no
reference
to
the
standards
as
set
forth
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
in
this
complaint.
they
referred
to
the
line
of
commerce
as
being
commercial
banking
which
was
the
line
of
commerce
this
court
followed
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
i
submit
your
honors
that
in
the
trial
courts
in
these
six
cases,
the
government
has
followed
a
very
consistent
position,
and
that
position
is
the
bank
--
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
is
applicable
just
as
in
they
said
--
just
as
they
said
in
crocker-anglo,
the
bank
mergers
act
of
1966
has
made
no
substantial
changes.
we
can
still
follow
the
bank
--
clayton
act
section
7.
mr.
david
t.
searls
because
the
bank
merger
act
of
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
what
if
they're
wrong
about
that,
then
they
have
failed
to
state
their
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
as
a
matter
of
law
i
would
say
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
not
mention,
i'm
alleging
the
facts
but
set
forth
the
tests
of
the
bank
merger
act
procedures.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
beg
your
honor?
mr.
david
t.
searls
because
they
refer
only
to
section
7.
mr.
david
t.
searls
they
show
that
they're
only
trying
to
apply
the
standards
of
section
7.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
have
said,
they
must
bring
their
case
on
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
because
the
--
that
was
the
intention
of
congress
that
this
provision
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
would
be
substituted
for
the
standards
of
section
7
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
-
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
it
is.
mr.
david
t.
searls
and
that's
my
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
that's
my
position
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
no.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
the
reference
to
section
7
would
be
surplasage
but
i
don't
think
it
--
i
think
they
could
come
forward
and
allege
the
two
steps,
and
that's
what
the
trial
court
said.
you
must
allege
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
and
you
must
further
allege
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
are
not
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
if
they
alleged
the
facts
establishing
those
two
steps,
then
i
say
the
complaint
would
be
sufficient
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
regardless
what
they
allege
about
section
7
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
--
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
david
t.
searls
as
the
--
these
standards
set
forth
in
section
7.
it
wiped
out
those
standards
and
substituted
other
standards
to
test
the
legality
of
the
bank
merger.
mr.
david
t.
searls
it
may
have
left
the
remedy,
the
procedure
under
section
7,
or
the
procedure
under
the
sherman
act,
or
the
remedies
under
the
sherman
act
or
under
the
clayton
act.
but
as
far
as
the
standards
to
be
applied
the
substantive
standards,
i
say
they
were
suspended
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
now
we
say
that
this
provision,
the
second
step,
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
is
an
intricate
part
of
the
test.
it's
one
of
the
elements
of
the
test.
it's
not
an
exception
as
is
contended
for
by
the
department
of
justice.
but
as
a
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
--
public
interest
provision
is
where
do
the
ultimate
issue
to
be
determined
under
section
--
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
mr.
david
t.
searls
your
honor
that
summarizes
my
position
exactly.
i
wish
that
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
is
true.
there
are
those
two
attacks
and
that
is
exactly
our
position
here.
now,
we
say
under
no
case
--
under
no
situation,
should
this
case
be
reversed
to
give
the
government
an
opportunity
to
amend.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
amend.
they
exercised
their
election
to
stand
on
their
complaint
and
refuse
to
amend.
the
facts
have
been
placed
in
the
state
of
limbo
and
held
in
the
state
of
advance
by
reason
of
the
statutory
injunction
that
follows
the
filing
of
a
complaint.
and
they
are
in
very
vulnerable
position.
they
cannot
continue
it
indefinitely
this
way.
now,
the
government
having
elected
to
stand
on
this
complaint
and
refused
to
amend,
we
submit
that
it
would
not
be
proper
to
give
them
a
second
opportunity
to
amend.
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
your
honor.
this
case
is
reversed,
this
merger
will
not
be
approved.
is
--
so
i've
been
instructed
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
if
this
case
is
reversed,
this
merger
will
be
terminated.
it
will
not
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
banks
will
not
stand
by
for
any
case
of
reversal.
the
merger
will
be
terminated
because
that
smaller
bank
had
given
a
notice
of
termination
that
this
merger
can't
be
consummated
by
june
30.
that's
why
i
say
we
stand
to
fall
them
out,
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
sustained
by
the
trial
court.
now
i'm
dividing
my
time
equally
with
the
counsel
for
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
mr.
david
t.
searls
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
have
been
six
decisions
rendered
ever
since
the
passage
of
the
merger
--
bank
merger
act
of
1966
by
the
trial
courts,
the
federal
trial
courts.
each
of
those
six
decisions
is
contrary
to
an
adverse
to
the
government
in
this
case.
in
each
of
those
six
cases,
the
trial
judge
held
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
was
the
controlling
statute.
one
of
those
six
decisions
is
a
three-judge
court
by
--
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
one
circuit
judge
and
two
district
judges
sitting.
in
the
present
case,
the
suit
is
brought
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
the
trial
court
passed
strictly
on
pleading
a
question
because
the
only
issue
before
the
court
was
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
properly
so,
on
motion
to
dismiss,
the
only
question
is
does
the
pleading
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted.
as
a
matter
of
law,
does
it
state
a
cause
of
action?
so
the
trial
judge
as
the
learned
counsel
for
the
department
of
justice
have
conceded,
did
not
reach
the
question
as
to
the
weight
to
be
given,
the
comptroller's
opinion
and
decision.
the
trial
judge
was
merely
holding
in
this
case,
you
have
to
bring
the
case
under
the
bank
merger
of
1966.
you
have
to
allege
in
your
complaint
those
issues,
those
standards
which
make
up
the
test
or
the
bank
merger
of
1966.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
trial
judge
is
passing
on
a
pleading
question
and
we
have
setout
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
a
colloquy
between
the
court
and
the
counsel
for
the
department
of
justice.
the
court
said,
"well,
the
burden,
i
am
not
too
much
concerned
about
the
burden
of
proof,
but
as
to
what
is
actually
necessary
for
you
to
allege.
that
is
what
we
are
concerned
about
here."
the
court
rather
said,
"i
recognized
full
will
that
this
is
very
important
and
serious
litigation.
and
i
have
no
more
desire
than
judge
clarie
had
to
dispose
of
this
matter
on
a
matter
of
pleading.
normally
of
course
we
don't."
then
he
said
to
the
attorney
for
the
department
of
justice,
"the
defendants
and
the
intervener
as
i
understand
it,
such
authorities
are
here
seem
to
say,
that
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
allege,
(a),
that
the
effect
would
be
anticompetitive,
and
(b),
that
it
is
not
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
need.
it
seems
to
me
as
simple
as
that."
then
he
further
said,
"i
think
it
is
just
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
you
have
alleged
the
cause
of
action
or
if
you
ought
to
amend
and
undertake
to
do
so,
if
you
haven't
already
done
it."
the
trial
judge
almost
solicited
the
department
of
justice
in
this
case
to
come
forward
and
amend
the
complaint.
and
although
the
department
gave
no
indication
that
they
had
any
desire
to
amend,
when
the
trial
court
entered
this
judgment
of
dismissal,
he
gave
them
10
days
in
which
to
amend.
now
the
position,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
well
certainly
--
ordinarily,
the
burden
of
proof
follows
the
burden
of
pleading,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
does
not
necessarily
follow
and
this
court
has
held
that
it
does
not
necessarily
follow.
but
the
court
here
was
not
reaching
the
burden
of
proof.
that
would
not
more
properly
come
before
a
trial
judge
in
a
pretrial
hearing
or
on
the
trial
of
the
case.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
am
ought
to
view
in
the
light
of
these
few
authorities
which
we
have
at
this
time,
that
the
pact
of
1966
made
some
rather
substantial
changes
in
the
law.
i
understand
the
cases
to
hold
the
burden
to
be
on
the
plaintiff,
to
allege
and
prove
an
anticompetitive
effect
of
the
merger,
and
further
that
that
is
not
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
aspect
of
the
matter.
i
think
the
court
was
saying
under
these
authorities
which
you
have
submitted
to
them.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
to
allege
and
prove,
he
was
analyzing
those
authorities,
he
said
those
are
what
those
cases
hold.
but
he
said,
the
question
before
me
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
a
question
of
pleading,
have
you
alleged
sufficient
facts
for
stated
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
t.
searls
your
honor
i
don't
think
--
as
i
said
on
the
previous
page,
at
the
beginning
of
this
appendix,
the
court
said,
"well,
the
burden,
i
am
not
too
much
concerned
about
the
burden
of
proof
but
is
what
is
actually
necessary
for
you
to
allege?"
i
think
the
trial
court
only
determined
the
question
of
pleading,
what
was
necessary
to
allege.
but
he
analyzed
the
authorities
to
hold
that
the
burden
was
on
the
plaintiff
to
allege
and
prove.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
he
would
because
i
think
your
honor
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
in
this
case,
to
prove
both
of
the
standards
by
the
--
that
set
--
that
is
set
forth
in
the
test
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
mr.
david
t.
searls
not
the
burden
of
proof
in
our
case,
in
a
--
i
think
for
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
sustained,
it
is
only
a
matter
of
looking
at
the
complaint
and
saying,
"does
the
complaint
state
a
cause
of
action
an
--
as
a
matter
of
law."
in
view
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
does
this
complaint
state
a
cause
of
action?
i
think
that
was
the
only
issue
before
the
trial
court.
now,
your
honor
i
want
to
submit
that
the
position
taken
by
the
department
of
justice
before
your
honors
is
entirely
different
from
the
position
taken
in
these
six
cases
in
the
trial
court.
the
department
of
justice
has
taken
a
consistent
position
in
the
trial
court
that
section
7
governs
bank
merger
act
by
the
bank
mergers
even
since
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
position
that
they're
taking
in
the
trial
courts,
they
were
seeking
to
have
a
determination
such
as
was
obtained
in
philadelphia
national
bank,
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
did
not
in
any
way
change
the
substantive
standards
to
be
applied
in
a
suit
for
violation
of
the
antitrust
law,
this
court
so
held.
but
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960,
there
was
no
provision
that
the
department
of
justice
and
the
courts
had
to
follow
the
same
test
and
the
same
standards
that
the
comptroller
was
required
to
follow.
this
court
recognized
that
fact
to
be
true
and
said
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
did
not
change
the
substantive
test
to
be
applied
in
a
suit
claiming
a
violation
of
antitrust
laws.
that
was
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
the
passage
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
was
to
set
forth
and
provide
as
the
committee
stated
in
its
report
or
the
banking
committee
in
the
house.
the
bill
would've
established
a
single
set
of
standards
for
the
consideration
of
future
mergers
by
the
banking
supervisory
agencies,
the
department
of
justice,
and
the
courts.
and
what
was
this
single
set
of
standards?
the
court
said,
"it
would
include
both
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
competition
and
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community."
those
are
the
two
elements
that
make
up
the
test
and
we
submit
that
that
has
been
carried
forward
into
the
statute
of
--
it
was
finally
passed.
whether
they
say
these
cases
were
brought
in
the
trial
court
on
an
entirely
different
theory,
we
now
find,
the
counsel
for
the
department
of
justice
say
this
morning
and
also
yesterday,
that
we
do
belong
--
we
do
not
dispute,
the
bank
merger
specifies
the
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
district
court
in
any
antitrust
proceeding
brought
against
bank
mergers.
the
government
in
no
way
has
intended
to
dispute
this
by
drafting
its
complaint
in
terms
of
section
7.
but
if
--
then,
it's
further
said
yesterday
and
today,
if
any
court
had
merely
requested
us
to
amend
our
complaints
to
make
reference
to
the
bank
merger
act,
we
would
have
done
so.
but
what
was
the
--
what's
been
the
position
that's
been
taken
to
the
trial
courts
from
these
cases?
the
first
decision,
the
three-judge
court
case
in
california
rendered
before
this
suit
was
ever
filed,
the
crocker-anglo
case.
the
court
set
forth
what
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
was.
in
its
opinion,
the
court
said
it
is
the
government's
view
that
the
new
statute
made
no
substantial
change
in
the
law
or
standards
to
be
applied
in
passing
up
on
the
issues
here
presented.
the
government
puts
it
does
then,
it
quotes
the
government's
position.
it
is
of
course
the
essential
position
of
the
government
that
the
1966
amendment
to
the
bank
merger
act
has
not
resulted
in
substantial
change
in
substantive
antitrust
law
or
in
the
standards
used
by
the
courts
in
determining
the
legality
of
bank
mergers.
but
then
the
three-judge
court
in
california
said,
"we
find
no
difficulty
in
concluding
that
then
you
win
that
made
substantial
changes
in
the
substantive
law
and
in
the
standards
to
be
applied
in
this
case."
mr.
david
t.
searls
those
standards
were,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
yes
your
honor,
that
they
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
standard
was
a
substantial
listing
of
competition.
mr.
david
t.
searls
but
in
section
7,
the
clayton
act,
it
says
in
any
line
of
commerce,
the
phrase
in
any
line
of
commerce
was
left
out
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
and
the
congressional
history
discloses
that
it
was
intentionally
omitted
so
that
you
would
not
determine
the
competitive
impact,
say,
in
commercial
banking
as
your
honors
held
in
the
national
--
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
but
you
would
determine
the
competitive
impact
in
the
light
of
all
the
financial
institutions
which
might
be
competing
with
commercial
banks
such
as
mortgage
loans,
company
savings
loan,
associations
and
so
forth.
mr.
david
t.
searls
and
then
they
--
and
then
the
other
step
was
the
public
interest
provision
which
is
not
included
in
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
and
it
is
not
included
in
section
7
with
the
clayton
act.
and
that
is
whether
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
merger
are
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
and
then,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
said,
"in
every
case,
the
responsible
agency
shall
take
into
consideration
the
financial
and
managerial
resources
and
future's
prospects
of
the
existing
and
proposed
institutions
and
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served
and
further
provides
that
courts
should
follow
the
same
standards
in
a
suit
--
in
a
judicial
proceeding."
mr.
david
t.
searls
they
claim
it's
a
defensive
matter.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
they
say
that
you
have
to
raise
it
as
a
defense,
and
of
course
it
may
or
may
not
be
raised
as
a
defense
that
depends
--
its
optional
where
the
defendant
what
defense
will
they
raise
of
course.
and
i'm
won't
--
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
matter
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
is
one
of
the
basic
differences
i'd
say
your
honor.
we
say
section
7
has
no
application
because
the
substantive
standards
of
section
7
are
no
longer
to
be
applied.
mr.
david
t.
searls
as
far
as
substantive
law
is
concerned.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
that's
true.
not
just
the
admission
of
any
in
line
of
commerce,
but
also
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
--
the
addition
of
the
convenience
and
needs.
mr.
david
t.
searls
section
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
is
--
we
take
that
position
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
could
be
in
any
inquiry
into
the
line
of
commerce.
mr.
david
t.
searls
in
section
1
because,
i
think
section
1
is
supplanted
in
bank
merger
cases
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
just
like
the
section
7
is.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes
sir,
but
the
congressional
history
shows
your
honor
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
in
section
1.
well,
of
course
that
does
not
appear
in
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
but
the
congressional
history
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
discloses
that
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce
were
intentionally
omitted
from
the
statute.
now
as
i've
said,
the
position
taken
here,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
is
not
applicable
is
different
from
what
--
before
the
trial
courts
when
they
rendered
these
six
decisions.
just
right
--
were
said
in
the
crocker-anglo
case,
the
government
took
the
position,
well,
there
is
no
substantial
difference
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
section
7
is
still
applicable.
now
in
the
saint
louis
bank
merger
case,
the
trial
court
as
here
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
and
in
the
saint
louis
bank
case,
the
court
said
the
plaintiff,
that
is
the
department
of
justice,
takes
the
position
of
the
sherman
and
clayton
acts
are
still
the
only
statutes
applicable
to
this
suit
and
that
bam
of
1966
has
an
effect
upon
the
comptroller.
in
other
words,
in
the
saint
louis
case,
the
trial
judge
said
that's
the
position
of
the
government,
the
bma
--
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
has
an
effect
only
upon
the
comptroller.
but
as
far
as
the
judicial
proceeding
is
concerned,
it
is
only
a
section
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
which
were
applicable.
and
i
on
this
case,
the
trial
court
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss
stating
that
the
plaintiff's
complaint
does
not
beat
--
meet
the
basic
minimum
standards
of
notice
pleading
in
that
it
has
not
alleged
a
violation
of
bma
66,
the
act
that
applies
to
all
bank
mergers.
so
the
court
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
complaint
in
this
case
--
the
bank
--
in
the
saint
louis
case
had
gave
the
government
20
days
in
which
to
amend
and
just
to
say
it
failed
and
refused
to
amend
in
this
case,
they
have
failed
and
refused
to
amend
in
the
saint
louis
case.
now,
in
the
provident
bank
case
in
philadelphia
which
will
follow
this
case
in
argument,
the
trial
judge
said
the
court
therefore
finds
that
since
justice
has
definitelyrefused
to
try
its
case
under
bma
66,
the
bank
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
expense
and
inconvenience
of
a
trial
when
the
justice
refused
to
prove
other
than
admitted
facts
to
establish
its
case.
and
likewise
in
the
present
case,
the
trial
judge
here
says,
"i
get
the
impression
you
don't
really
want
to
amend
and
if
you
don't
want
to
amend,
if
you
want
to
stand
on
this
one
proposition
so
that
justice
under
clayton
7
will
still
control
mergers
or
any
mergers
of
banks.
anyone
would
say
that
you
didn't
overlook
this
allegation
regarding
to
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
inadvertently
or
accidentally,
it's
intentionally.
and
so
in
this
complaint
as
before
your
honors
here
and
the
--
which
is
the
same
complaint
as
before
the
trial
court
of
course,
they
have
alleged,
and
this
complaint
appears
in
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief.
they
have
sought
to
enjoin
this
bank
merger
as
a
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
under
the
heading,
the
offense
charged,
they
have
alleged,
it
appears
on
page
75
of
the
government's
brief.
they
have
alleged
in
regard
to
the
offense
charge
that
the
two
banks
have
entered
into
an
agreement
of
merger
and
that
such
agreement
is
violative
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
in
the
prayer,
they
had
asked
that
the
court
adjudicate
that
supposed
merger
violates
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
there
is
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
in
their
complaint.
there's
no
reference
to
the
standards
as
set
forth
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
in
this
complaint.
they
referred
to
the
line
of
commerce
as
being
commercial
banking
which
was
the
line
of
commerce
this
court
followed
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
i
submit
your
honors
that
in
the
trial
courts
in
these
six
cases,
the
government
has
followed
a
very
consistent
position,
and
that
position
is
the
bank
--
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
is
applicable
just
as
in
they
said
--
just
as
they
said
in
crocker-anglo,
the
bank
mergers
act
of
1966
has
made
no
substantial
changes.
we
can
still
follow
the
bank
--
clayton
act
section
7.
mr.
david
t.
searls
because
the
bank
merger
act
of
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
what
if
they're
wrong
about
that,
then
they
have
failed
to
state
their
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
as
a
matter
of
law
i
would
say
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
not
mention,
i'm
alleging
the
facts
but
set
forth
the
tests
of
the
bank
merger
act
procedures.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
beg
your
honor?
mr.
david
t.
searls
because
they
refer
only
to
section
7.
mr.
david
t.
searls
they
show
that
they're
only
trying
to
apply
the
standards
of
section
7.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
have
said,
they
must
bring
their
case
on
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
because
the
--
that
was
the
intention
of
congress
that
this
provision
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
would
be
substituted
for
the
standards
of
section
7
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
-
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
it
is.
mr.
david
t.
searls
and
that's
my
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
that's
my
position
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
no.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
the
reference
to
section
7
would
be
surplasage
but
i
don't
think
it
--
i
think
they
could
come
forward
and
allege
the
two
steps,
and
that's
what
the
trial
court
said.
you
must
allege
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
and
you
must
further
allege
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
are
not
clearly
outweighed
in
the
public
interest
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
if
they
alleged
the
facts
establishing
those
two
steps,
then
i
say
the
complaint
would
be
sufficient
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
regardless
what
they
allege
about
section
7
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
--
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
david
t.
searls
as
the
--
these
standards
set
forth
in
section
7.
it
wiped
out
those
standards
and
substituted
other
standards
to
test
the
legality
of
the
bank
merger.
mr.
david
t.
searls
it
may
have
left
the
remedy,
the
procedure
under
section
7,
or
the
procedure
under
the
sherman
act,
or
the
remedies
under
the
sherman
act
or
under
the
clayton
act.
but
as
far
as
the
standards
to
be
applied
the
substantive
standards,
i
say
they
were
suspended
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
now
we
say
that
this
provision,
the
second
step,
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
is
an
intricate
part
of
the
test.
it's
one
of
the
elements
of
the
test.
it's
not
an
exception
as
is
contended
for
by
the
department
of
justice.
but
as
a
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
--
public
interest
provision
is
where
do
the
ultimate
issue
to
be
determined
under
section
--
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
mr.
david
t.
searls
your
honor
that
summarizes
my
position
exactly.
i
wish
that
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
that
is
true.
there
are
those
two
attacks
and
that
is
exactly
our
position
here.
now,
we
say
under
no
case
--
under
no
situation,
should
this
case
be
reversed
to
give
the
government
an
opportunity
to
amend.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
amend.
they
exercised
their
election
to
stand
on
their
complaint
and
refuse
to
amend.
the
facts
have
been
placed
in
the
state
of
limbo
and
held
in
the
state
of
advance
by
reason
of
the
statutory
injunction
that
follows
the
filing
of
a
complaint.
and
they
are
in
very
vulnerable
position.
they
cannot
continue
it
indefinitely
this
way.
now,
the
government
having
elected
to
stand
on
this
complaint
and
refused
to
amend,
we
submit
that
it
would
not
be
proper
to
give
them
a
second
opportunity
to
amend.
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
your
honor.
this
case
is
reversed,
this
merger
will
not
be
approved.
is
--
so
i've
been
instructed
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
if
this
case
is
reversed,
this
merger
will
be
terminated.
it
will
not
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
banks
will
not
stand
by
for
any
case
of
reversal.
the
merger
will
be
terminated
because
that
smaller
bank
had
given
a
notice
of
termination
that
this
merger
can't
be
consummated
by
june
30.
that's
why
i
say
we
stand
to
fall
them
out,
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
sustained
by
the
trial
court.
now
i'm
dividing
my
time
equally
with
the
counsel
for
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
