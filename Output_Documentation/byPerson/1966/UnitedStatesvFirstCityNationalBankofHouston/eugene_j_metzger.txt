mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
decided
by
the
court
below
in
either
the
pleading
question
suggested
by
my
distinguished
colleague
mr.
searls
nor
the
narrow
technical
question
and
secondary
question
on
the
locus
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
convenience
and
needs
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
department
of
justice.
rather
--
it
was
the
decision
of
the
lower
courts
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
have
been
supplanted
as
the
legislative
test
of
bank
mergers
by
the
new,
substantively
distinct
statutory
scheme
embodied
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
this
standard
was
rejected
by
the
department
of
justice
and
the
courts
below.
they
flatly
denied
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
had
any
substantive
effect
as
mr.
searls
quoted
from
the
justice
at
brief
in
the
crocker
case
which
was
the
first
expression
of
justice's
position
through
their
brief
in
the
lower
court
in
this
case,
the
houston
case,
which
was
the
last
expression
of
its
opinion
where
they
said
and
i
quote
from
their
brief
below,
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
is
still
applicable
to
bank
mergers.
it
has
not
been
replaced
or
repealed
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
and
the
plaintiff
is
not
required
to
plead
or
prove
a
violation
of
the
bank
merger
act.
now,
the
point
mr.
justice
fortas'
raised
before
is
particularly
relevant
to
the
reasons
why
the
department
of
justice
has
taken
this
position.
it
was
not
an
act
of
casual
intransigence
upon
the
part
of
justice
below
that
it
only
alleged
a
violation
of
clayton
7,
nor
is
it
an
act
of
mere
whim
that
counsel
here
has
changed
his
posture
from
that
below
to
argue
convenience
and
needs
is
the
question
rather
than
which
is
the
applicable
statute.
justice
needs
an
independent
statute
upon
which
to
predicate
the
logic
of
its
case.
if
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
has
supplanted
clayton
7,
then
justice's
suit
must
be
predicated
upon
and
taken
from
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
if
that
is
so,
the
internal
logic
of
that
statute
requires
with
us
to
considerate
as
a
review
of
the
statute
and
a
review
standard
the
justice
must
apply.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
court
below
suggested
that
the
--
the
justice
below
suggested
that
clayton
7
still
applied.
they
needed
an
independent
statute
to
get
them
into
court.
they
needed
to
say,
"we
don't
need
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
we
must
--
we
can
sue
under
our
own
statutory
standards."
now
we
shall
demonstrate
that
clayton
7
no
longer
applies
to
banking
and
justice's
suit
consequently
to
quote
judge
clarie
below,
lies
within
the
ambit
of
bma
66.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
application
of
the
precise
terms
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
precludes
the
application
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
of
the
clayton
7.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
no,
let
me
explain
this
to
you
sir.
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
states
that
in
any
suit,
you
shall
apply
the
standards
of
this
act.
now
let
us
take
any
possible
instance
in
which
a
bank
merger
might
arise.
the
banks
proposed
a
merge.
no
suit
can
arise
until
the
bank
merger
--
the
bank
regulatory
agency
approves
that
merger
since
--
that
is
a
requirement
of
the
statute.
so
we
start
from
the
premise
that
any
bank
merger
as
to
which
an
antitrust
suit
is
brought
must
be
one
which
has
been
approved
by
the
bank
regulatory
agencies.
now
then
we
have
two
possibilities,
either
the
bank
regulatory
agencies
properly
carried
out
the
standards
established
in
the
bank
merger
act
or
they
did
not.
now
let
us
assume
the
first
case
where
the
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
were
met
by
the
bank
regulatory
agency.
that
is,
its
determination
was
correctly
that
either
the
statute
did
not
substantially
lessen
competition
or
that
if
it
did
that
that
was
all
the
common
public
interest
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
in
that
event,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
states
that
the
courts
must
in
the
first
instance
apply
the
same
standard
and
in
the
--
section
7
(b),
and
section
7
(c)
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
provides
that
in
the
event
of
the
standards
of
bma
66
have
been
made
by
the
bank
regulatory
agency
that
the
department
of
justice
may
not
sue
on
any
other
action.
well,
the
net
effect
of
that
is,
if
the
bank
regulatory
agency
properly
met
the
standards
of
bma
66,
no
clayton
act
suit
could
be
reached,
no
clayton
act
decision
could
be
reached.
and
let's
take
the
other
side
of
that
point,
suppose
that
the
agency
was
incorrect,
and
it
could
not,
it
did
not
meet
the
standards
of
the
acts,
the
court
in
applying
the
standards
of
bma
66
as
instructed
in
section
7
(b)
would
so
find.
they
would
find
as
a
fact
that
the
agency
was
incorrect
and
it
should
not
have
approved
the
merger.
the
statute,
section
7
--
section
5
says,
the
agency
shall
not
approve
and
then
follows
the
test
that
we've
just
discused.
well,
if
the
agency
shall
not
approve
and
they
did
improperly
approved
and
the
court
so
finds
in
the
first
instance,
it
can
now
--
it
may
have
never
reached
a
clayton
7
issue
because
its
whole
case
is
before
--
is
decided
before
it.
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
says
the
agency
should
not
have
approved.
the
court
finds
the
fact
that
it
should
not
have
approved.
therefore
it
says
to
the
agency
and
to
the
banks,
"no,
you
may
not
go
through
with
this
merger
since
we
find
that
the
standards
of
the
act
were
not
met."
then
in
any
instance,
we
will
never
reach
a
clayton
7
case.
therefore,
that
internal
logic
makes
it
impossible
for
clayton
7
to
continue
to
apply.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
legislative
history
also
supports
that
mr.
justice
black
in
that
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
in
the
legislative
--
there
is
no
specific
language
that
says,
"we
are
now
in
this
process
repealing."
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
i
think
we
could've
avoided
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
if
it
had
said
that
sir.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
but
let
me
say
to
you
the
legislative
history
which
also
demonstrates
the
same
facts
mr.
justice
black.
in
the
legislative
history,
we
have
the
fact
that
the
ashley-ottinger
bill
which
is
--
which
was
essentially
the
bill
was
ultimately
enacted,
set
down
the
same
standards
that
are
in
this
bill
today.
and
it
said
--
it
stated
these
standards
in
the
terms
which
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
the
next
day
after
the
ashley-ottinger
bill
was
passed
by
the
committee,
the
representative
royce
proposed
an
amendment
to
the
ashley-ottinger
bill.
now
all
his
amendments
said
and
the
only
thing
it
said
was,
"let's
have
this
standard
of
section
5
(b)
apply
sections
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act."
that's
the
only
substantive
difference
between
representative
royce's
proposal
and
the
ashley-ottinger
bill.
now
that
proposal
of
representative
royce
was
rejected
by
the
committee.
and
that
they
say,
"the
only
difference
between
the
two
is
the
specific
reference
to
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act."
now,
he
proposed
to
amend
5
by
also
specifically
stating
that
section
2
is
still
applied.
now
of
course
that
is
already
--
was
already
covered
in
ashley-ottinger
by
section
7
(a)
(b)
and
section
2
(a)
(b).
but,
to
the
court
--
so
the
congr--
the
committee
said,
"fine,
we'll
accept
your
amendment.
we'll
accept
your
addition
5
(a)."
it
made
no
substantive
difference
by
they
put
it
in.
the
only
thing
of
his
proposal
that
he
rejected
was
a
proposal
to
specifically
refer
to
the
act
--
the
action
in
the
antitrust
court
as
being
a
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
or
a
section
7
of
the
clayton
action.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
i
think
they
did
do
that
and
consciously
did
do
that.
i
just
think
--
they
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
neglected
to
say
it.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
we
get
that
from
the
logic
of
say
--
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
which
i
currently
going
to
do.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
unfortunate
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
unfortunately,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
have
language
on
either
direction.
i
suggest
that
the
only
logic
of
the
statute
and
the
only
legislative
history
supports
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
i
have
reached
regarding
this
into
which
i
have
already
adverted.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
first
case
in
which
section
7
was
charged
and
it
was
settled
before
it
reached
the
courts
was
transamerica
in
1959.
then,
of
course
we
had
our
(inaudible)
pennsylvania
bank
was
the
first
case
that
actually
reached
this
court
in
1963.
up
until
that
time,
it
had
been
thought
by
many
commentators
that
for
various
technical
reasons
that
the
bank
merger
--
that
bank
mergers
were
exempted
in
the
clayton
act.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
what
you're
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
you're
suggesting
a
repeal
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
don't
think
we
necessarily
reached
that
question.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
i
think
what
it
has
done
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
is
to
substitute
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
has
substituted.
it
has
substituted
other
antitrust
standards
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
for
the
antitrust
standards
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
well,
let
me
cite
the
language
of
the
statute
in
which
it
recites
some
clayton
act
standards
and
omits
others
and
it
adds
other
standards
to
the
previously
applicable
clayton
act
standard.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
takes
away
some
of
it
and
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
applies
--
it
applies
some
of
the
standards
where
section
7
had
used
and
takes
it
to
its
own
and
adapts
them
as
its
standards.
of
course,
in
the
chain
circumstances
of
this
act
which
establishes
its
own
frame
of
reference
within
which
to
examine
this
antitrust
criteria.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
it
--
our
view
of
that
is
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
our
view
of
that
is
simply
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
is
a
part
of
those
laws,
that
the
bank
merger
act
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
it
is
an
antitrust
law
which
applies
in
banking
specifically
for
banking
just
as
there
are
different
antitrust
standards
and
therefore
even
called
an
antitrust
laws
to
apply
to
various
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
if
you
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
if
you'll
note,
they
also
picked
up
language
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
which
purports
to
encompass
those
portions
of
the
sherman
1
standards
which
they
have
chosen
to
adopt.
now
of
course
the
scheme
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
is
to
preserve
entirely
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
it
specifically
refuses
to
concede
--
it
refuses
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
it
disclaims
any
change
in
the
applicability
of
that
state
--
standard.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
not
at
all,
mr.
justice.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that's
correct,
but
it
didn't
do
away
with
them
since
most
of
the
standards
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that's
right.
since
most
of
the
standards
were
picked
up
by
this
act,
we
really
feel
that's
merely
a
change
in
focus.
now,
the
second
question
which
arises
naturally
under
this
--
the
standard
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
review
that's
taken
place
here.
is
it
a
general
judicial
review
of
the
decision
of
the
regulatory
agency
wherein
the
court
reserves
to
itself
questions
of
law
and
statutory
standards?
or
is
it,
as
justice
claims,
not
a
review
at
all?
but
an
independent
inquiry
untainted
by
the
conclusions
of
the
bank
regulatory
agency,
a
mere
image
of
the
bank
merger
act
in
1960.
we
believe
that
the
procedure
of
difficulties
which
this
court
found
to
be
a
fatal
impediment
in
bma
60
have
been
cured
in
this
statute.
bank
regulatory
agencies
on
review
we
feel
then
should
have
the
same
treatment
accorded
them
as
other
regulatory
agencies.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
de
novo
standard
mr.
justice
black,
we
feel
relates
to
the
ability
to
introduce
new
facts.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
dictionary
says
the
word
de
novo
means
a
fresh.
we
feel
that
it's
quite
clear
that,
in
this
review,
unlike
many
agency
reviews
say
the
icc
or
the
fcc
where
the
court
is
precluded
from
inquiring
into
the
facts
either
by
these
terms
of
the
statute
or
by
judicial
interpretation
that
that
--
the
word,
the
effect
of
the
words
de
novo
in
this
statute
has
been
to
establish
that
the
court
is
not
so
precluded
in
this
instance
that
when
the
court
is
examining
this
decision
of
this
agency,
it
is
free
to
search
out
such
new
facts
as
it
may
bear
--
shed
light
upon
the
issues.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
required
to,
of
course
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
for
the
word
trial
de
novo
has
been
variously
interpreted
because
of
its
constitutional
difficulties,
initially
to
hold
a
trial
without
reference
to
the
decision
below
but
a
number
of
courts
in
order
to
preserve
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
well,
no,
a
number
of
courts
mr.
justice
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
a
number
of
courts
having
--
in
order
to
preserve
the
constitutionality
of
a
alleged
statutory
trial
de
novo
of
a
--
an
administrative
agency's
decision,
have
found
it
necessary
to
amend
judicially
that
the
term
trial
de
novo
to
mean
simply
that
they're
going
to
make
a
complete
inquiry
into
the
facts
but
they
will
not
substitute
their
judgment
to
that
of
the
agency
since
that
they
feel
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
as
this
court
stated
in
the
keller
case,
trial
de
novo
in
that
instance
is
acceptable
so
long
as
the
first
court
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
means,
as
we
indicated
earlier,
that
a
complete
new
trial
of
the
facts
and
the
law.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that's
correct.
but
that
only
in
those
instances
where
the
court
below
is
not
an
article
iii
court
because
then
you
run
into
the
same
question
in
the
court
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
in
that
context,
they
have
that
meaning.
i
think
simply
in
this
statute
we're
being
asked
to
determine
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
an
agency
determination
of
a
broad
discretionary
statutory
term
which
is
--
has
been
in
the
first
instance
referred
to
that
agency.
in
that
case,
i
suggest
this
court's
decision
in
the
last
term
in
atlantic
refining
where
it
said,
"when
the
congress
has
provided
that
administrative
agency
initially
apply
a
broad
statutory
term
to
a
particular
situation,
our
function
is
limited
to
determining
whether
the
commission's
decision
has
warrant
in
the
record
for
reasonable
basis
in
the
law."
i
feel
that
this
is
the
standard
to
what
you
should
have
continued
to
relate
yourselves.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
now,
the
lack
of
the
--
that
isn't
quite
true
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
there
is
a
provision
for
a
record
and
there
is
a
very
substantial
record
here
mr.
justice
white.
i
wanted
to
have
a
chance
to
correct
that
impression
you
may
have
gained.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
--
there
is
when
sought.
now
we
have
for
several
years
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
well,
there
was
not
one
in
this
case,
no
one
asked
for
one.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
no,
but
there
was
in
--
for
example
crocker.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
no,
i
do
not
think
the
statute
requires
a
hearing.
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
there
was
not
one
in
this
case
that
if
this
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
stand
--
you
suggested
sir
that
there
is
no
record
here.
there
was
a
very
substantial
record
developed
in
all
of
these
bank
mergers.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
that
can
be
held
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
question
it
advanced
was,
"is
it
fair,
can
we
make
our
determination
lacking
a
hearing?
is
justice
fairly
treated
in
not
having
a
hearing
in
these
cases
since
it
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
all
the
facts?"
but
it
can.
all
it
need
do
is
ask
for
a
hearing
and
as
an
aggrieved
party
our
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
our
regulations
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
prevent
them
to
hold
it.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
our
--
actually
in
these
two
cases
that
are
presently
before
this
court
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
alright,
in
the
houston
case,
an
application
was
received.
that
application
was
accompanied
by
a
substantial
economic
brief
in
which
the
agency
--
which
the
merging
bank
set
forth
their
contentions
as
to
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
and
as
to
the
competitive
effects
and
set
forth
a
numerous
statistics
as
to
the
structure
of
the
market
and
the
nature
of
the
city.
now
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that
is
a
sworn
statement.
at
--
in
the
first
instance
are
--
our
examination
is
a
--
the
--
an
examiner
is
sent
out
into
the
field
to
make
inquiry
as
to
the
accuracy
of
those
representing
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that
was
not
in
this
case.
to
make
inquiry
and
to
do
accuracy
of
these
representations
and
also
to
test
the
community
reaction
to
the
merger
and
that
of
the
banks
as
well
or
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
pardon
me?
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
community
leaders
are
asked
their
reaction
to
this
particular
merger
whether
they
feel
it
would
help
or
hurt
or
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
development
of
the
community.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
everyone
of
the
principal
banks,
a
number
of
the
principal
businessmen
of
the
community
who
are
related
to
that
industry.
it's
a
substantial
inquiry.
it
takes
four
to
five
days
on
a
merger
of
this
size
for
the
examiner
to
make
his
survey
and
they
send
--
submits
a
report
of
that
to
the
regional
administrator
for
the
particular
region
in
which
he
operates
who
then
makes
a
cover
report
in
which
he
makes
his
recommendation.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
he
is
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
he
makes
the
(inaudible).
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
region
--
the
regional
administrator
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
regional
administrator
is
in
daily
contact
with
those
banks
which
he
supervises.
he
knows
them
all
personally,
he
works
with
them,
he
works
with
the
--
those
members
of
the
community
who
have
interest
in
banking
and
he
is
able
to
talk
through
his
dummy
conversations
with
everyone.
is
able
to
get
a
pretty
good
assessment
on
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
borrowers
or
one
of
the
groups
that
--
of
course
if
these
businessmen
aren't
borrowers,
they
are
one
of
the
groups
that
are
reached,
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
with
the
banking
community,
not
--
it's
not
--
not
at
all
with
the
particular
banks
involved
in
the
merger.
now,
when
the
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
we
do,
if
you
will
note
in
appendix
c
to
the
justice
department's
brief
starting
at
page
83,
there
is
about
25
pages
of
their
brief
relating
to
the
findings
that
we
made
in
houston.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
examiner
makes
findings
which
are
reviewed
by
the
regional
administrator
which
are
in
turn
reviewed
by
a
committee
at
--
in
our
washington
office,
which
makes
--
it's
only
an
independent
inquiry
into
what
it
feels
to
be
the
justifications.
he
makes
his
own
decisions.
each
one
of
those
members
of
the
committee
makes
his
own
observation
and
then
this
bulk
of
documentation,
its
presented
to
the
comptroller
for
his
ultimate
decision.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
and
if
this
was
a
review.
yes,
very
definitely
it
would
have
to
be.
if
it
is
not
a
review,
well
then
of
course
we
run
into
the
evidence
problems
that
as
(inaudible).
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
you
can't
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
you
can
put
it
into
evidence
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
you
can
put
into
evidence
mr.
justice
fortas
the
expertise
of
the
agency
and
the
literally
thousands
of
years
of
experience
in
relation
with
the
issues
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
that
the
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
the
officials
of
the
agency
have.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
as
a
technical
question
of
evidence,
i
would
say
that
in
the
event
that
the
nature
of
the
review
was
a
judicial
review
of
an
administrative
agency
determination,
i
should
say
that
that
would
be
evidential.
if
it
is
not,
i
think
--
suggest,
we
would
have
to
prove
all
of
these
all
over
again
and
much
of
it,
you
can't,
simply
cannot.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
much
of
that,
the
district
courts
wouldn't
allow
in,
much
of
it
is
second
hand.
it's
a
hearsay,
its
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
and
then
--
and
--
but
that
same
expert
judgment
is
applied
at
every
step
of
the
review
procedure
within
our
agency
up
through
to
fin
--
the
final
decision
by
the
comptroller
who
was
weighing
factors
that
perhaps
weren't
even
considered.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
ordinarily
of
course,
if
they
introduce
some
new
facts
we
feel
it
would
be
appropriate.
if
they
introduced
something
substantial,
it
really
--
we
had
not
considered
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
we
think
at
that
point,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
as
they
do
in
ordinary
judicial
reviews
to
remand
to
the
agency
for
consideration
of
these
new
facts
which
apparently
they
had
not
considered
below.
this
is
done
everyday
with
the
ftc
here
and
civil
hearings
and
reviews
of
other
agencies.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
he
does
not
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
he
does
not.
we
do
provide
for
hearings
at
the
request
of
any
party.
we
have
been
having
for
some
time
at
which
if
a
hearing
is
requested,
for
example
if
justice
had
requested
a
hearing
here,
they
would
have
had
a
formal
record,
witnesses
would
have
been
sworn
and
there
would
have
been
a
report
present
to
take
down
whatever
was
decided.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
and
there'll
be
cross
examination
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
is
not
required
by
the
law,
but
the
only
--
if
the
only
person
objecting
to
the
inadequacy
of
our
record
is
one
who
has
opportunity
to
make
that
record
complete,
we
suppose
that
that
individual
really
has
no
right
to
complain.
if
justice
doesn't
want
any
part
of
our
hearings,
in
the
crocker
case,
we
offered
them
to
come
in,
and
the
court
asked
them
to
come
in
and
they
refused.
they
--
he
felt
that
there
was
nothing
that
we
could
add
to
the
clayton
7
case
that
they
had
brought.
and
therefore
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
not
the
administrative
procedure
act
mr.
justice
white,
we
feel
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
oh,
or
we'd
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
there
has
been
a
considerable
body
of
law
developed
over
the
last
several
years.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
body
of
law,
developed
over
the
last
several
years
as
to
what
standards
we
--
our
hearings
must
hold.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
after
the
smithfield,
we
agreed
in
--
largely
with
smithfield.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
we
have,
there
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
there
has
been
--
there
are
some
50
cases,
branch
cases
in
the
lower
courts
now
at
which
our
hearing
procedures
are
very
much
at
issue
and
those
hearing
procedures
have
been
refined
over
the
years
after
smithfield
in
order
to
accommodate
the
question
raised
by
that
court.
our
hearing
procedures
are
substantial.
they
are
not
apa
and
in
a
complete
format,
but
they
do
apply
i
think
procedural
due
process
and
the
rights
to
all
--
with
the
parties.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
now
the
apa,
mr.
justice
white,
provides
something
quite
different.
the
apa
provides
that
it
will
review
and
it
will
sup
--
would
apply
an
administrative
accuracy
to
an
agency
action,
not
to
an
agency
hearing.
an
agency
action
is
to
find
as
anything
the
agency
may
do
which
finally
affects
the
rights
of
an
individual
even
to
doing
nothing.
now
we
certainly
can
hold
a
hearing
and
do
nothing
in
regard
to
that.
i
suggest
accordingly
that
that
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
due
process
of
right
that
comes
out
of
our
decisions
need
not
follow
a
hearing.
the
section
1009
of
title
5
which
is
the
apa
procedure
referred
to
permits
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
to
apply
to
a
decision
of
an
agency
which
is
not
a
decision,
which
may
be
a
determination
by
an
executive
sitting
behind
the
desk
with
no
record
of
any
kind.
it
may
be
a
failure
to
act
entirely.
it
may
be
an
action
that
has
some
hearing
proceedings
but
not
full
panoply.
it
could
be
just
about
anything.
so
i
don't
think
that
could
create
any
real
problem.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
if
i
may
have
several
minutes
to
do
that,
i
would
like
to
do
that.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
first
action,
the
--
april
5th,
1965,
mr.
--
senator
robertson
introduced
his
bill
of
1698.
this
bill
proposed
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
apply
to
banking
to
do
anything.
and
that
all
mergers
which
have
taken
place
before
may
3rd,
1960
would
be
considered
acceptable
and
could
not
be
attacked.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
this
was
amended
by
a
motion
of
senator
proxmire
in
june
of
1965
to
provide
that
justice
would
have
30
days
in
which
to
bring
a
sherman
1
or
clayton
7
action.
and
that
the
wiping
out
of
all
liability
on
previous
mergers
would
be
moved
up
from
may
3rd,
1962,
the
date
--
the
prospective
date
of
the
enactment
of
senator
proxmire's
bill.
this
bill
was
passed
by
voice
vote
of
the
senate
on
june
11th,
1965.
it
went
to
the
house
where
senator
--
where
representative
patman's
committee,
banking
and
finance
committee
of
the
house
took
it
under
advisement
and
representative
patman
did
his
best
to
bury
it
that
point.
i
think
it's
very
--
would
be
very
germane
if
the
court
would
study
appendices
a,
b,
and
c
of
our
brief
to
note
the
legislative
history
of
the
entrance
of
the
representative
robertson
to
representative
patman
to
avoid
any
bill
being
enacted.
now,
on
september
15,
1965,
representative
ashley,
who
had
taken
the
lead
from
bringing
any
bill
to
pass
in
this
--
in
the
house,
proposed
11011.
now
this
bill
provided
pretty
much
the
same
standards
that
are
in
bma
66,
but
it
did
provide
in
addition
that
the
agencies
were
to
home
a
full
apa
hearing
on
each
and
every
merger
proposal.
now,
as
you
know,
there
are
only
--
oh,
(inaudible)
in
a
moment.
the
justice
department
wrote
back
on
september
24th
and
suggested
that
this
would
be
inappropriate,
that
all
of
these
merger
hearings
were
not
really
relevant
that
in
only
a
few
instances
would
any
anti
--
serious
antitrust
questions
arise
therefore
it
would
be
economically
inadvisable
to
follow
the
full
apa
procedures
and
bank
mergers.
thereupon,
representative
ashley
rewrote
11011.
now,
he
didn't
change
the
basic
standards
of
the
act.
what
he
did
was
to
remove
the
full
apa
hearing
on
every
case.
now,
this
was
passed
by
the
committee,
this
ashley-ottinger
bill
was
passed
by
the
committee
on
october
19,
at
a
hearing
at
which
representative
patman
was
not
present,
a
majority
of
the
committee
was
there.
when
they
go
and
representative
patman
learned
that
the
committee's
hearingwas
in
session,
he
sent
representative
royce
into
the
committee
and
asked
for
that
--
the
hearing
be
dissolved
--
the
meeting
be
dissolved
as
not
in
accord
with
the
instructions
of
the
chairman.
the
committee
ignored
representative
royce's
proposal
and
passed
the
ashley-ottinger
bill
on
the
19th.
on
the
next
day
representative
royce
proposed
his
alternative
in
which
he
suggested
that
sections
1
and
section
7
be
reintroduced
into
the
standards.
you
will
recall
that
representative
--
senator
proxmire's
bill
would
have
applied
clayton
7
and
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
representative
ashley
took
it
out
of
his
bill.
representative
royce
proposed
to
put
it
back
in,
then
that
was
rejected
by
the
committee.
on
january
5th,
the
justice
department
proposed
to
representative
royce
a
bill
which
would
have
effectively
destroyed
the
bank
merger
act.
it
would
have
brought
it
back
to
the
position
right
after
the
pennsylvania
bank
case.
section
5
of
the
proposed
bill
by
justice
would
have
reduced
the
bank
merger
act
to
nothing
more
than
a
recognition
of
the
failing
company,
a
failing-company
doctrine.
now
that
was
the
basic
proposal
of
the
attorney
general
of
january
5th,
not
to
review
de
novo.
the
review
de
novo
in
section
7,
in
his
proposed
section
7
had
no
meaning
or
effect
at
all
if
they
could
get
the
congress
to
accept
the
failing
bank
doctrine
as
being
the
test
for
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
--
the
term
review
--
trial
de
novo
was
in
the
september
24th
letter
objecting
to
11011.
now
there
was

the

within

with

with

to

the

adverted
to

which
proposed

mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
language
of
review
de
novo
first
appears
in
the
record
in
the
attachment
to
the
january
5th
letter
of
the
department
of
justice.
we
suggested
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
we
suggested
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
and
opposed
by
section
5
of
that
statute
proposing
that
the
bank
merger
act
in
effect
be
wiped
out
and
be
returned
back
to
the
pnb
decision.
now
that
was
the
basic
essential
position
taken
by
the
department.
the
review
de
novo
standard
would
not
have
hurt
the
department
at
all
if
it
(inaudible)
--
if
the
congress
had
accepted
the
section
5
then
proposed
by
--
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
decided
by
the
court
below
in
either
the
pleading
question
suggested
by
my
distinguished
colleague
mr.
searls
nor
the
narrow
technical
question
and
secondary
question
on
the
locus
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
convenience
and
needs
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
department
of
justice.
rather
--
it
was
the
decision
of
the
lower
courts
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
have
been
supplanted
as
the
legislative
test
of
bank
mergers
by
the
new,
substantively
distinct
statutory
scheme
embodied
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
this
standard
was
rejected
by
the
department
of
justice
and
the
courts
below.
they
flatly
denied
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
had
any
substantive
effect
as
mr.
searls
quoted
from
the
justice
at
brief
in
the
crocker
case
which
was
the
first
expression
of
justice's
position
through
their
brief
in
the
lower
court
in
this
case,
the
houston
case,
which
was
the
last
expression
of
its
opinion
where
they
said
and
i
quote
from
their
brief
below,
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
is
still
applicable
to
bank
mergers.
it
has
not
been
replaced
or
repealed
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
and
the
plaintiff
is
not
required
to
plead
or
prove
a
violation
of
the
bank
merger
act.
now,
the
point
mr.
justice
fortas'
raised
before
is
particularly
relevant
to
the
reasons
why
the
department
of
justice
has
taken
this
position.
it
was
not
an
act
of
casual
intransigence
upon
the
part
of
justice
below
that
it
only
alleged
a
violation
of
clayton
7,
nor
is
it
an
act
of
mere
whim
that
counsel
here
has
changed
his
posture
from
that
below
to
argue
convenience
and
needs
is
the
question
rather
than
which
is
the
applicable
statute.
justice
needs
an
independent
statute
upon
which
to
predicate
the
logic
of
its
case.
if
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
has
supplanted
clayton
7,
then
justice's
suit
must
be
predicated
upon
and
taken
from
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
if
that
is
so,
the
internal
logic
of
that
statute
requires
with
us
to
considerate
as
a
review
of
the
statute
and
a
review
standard
the
justice
must
apply.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
court
below
suggested
that
the
--
the
justice
below
suggested
that
clayton
7
still
applied.
they
needed
an
independent
statute
to
get
them
into
court.
they
needed
to
say,
"we
don't
need
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
we
must
--
we
can
sue
under
our
own
statutory
standards."
now
we
shall
demonstrate
that
clayton
7
no
longer
applies
to
banking
and
justice's
suit
consequently
to
quote
judge
clarie
below,
lies
within
the
ambit
of
bma
66.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
application
of
the
precise
terms
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
precludes
the
application
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
of
the
clayton
7.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
no,
let
me
explain
this
to
you
sir.
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
states
that
in
any
suit,
you
shall
apply
the
standards
of
this
act.
now
let
us
take
any
possible
instance
in
which
a
bank
merger
might
arise.
the
banks
proposed
a
merge.
no
suit
can
arise
until
the
bank
merger
--
the
bank
regulatory
agency
approves
that
merger
since
--
that
is
a
requirement
of
the
statute.
so
we
start
from
the
premise
that
any
bank
merger
as
to
which
an
antitrust
suit
is
brought
must
be
one
which
has
been
approved
by
the
bank
regulatory
agencies.
now
then
we
have
two
possibilities,
either
the
bank
regulatory
agencies
properly
carried
out
the
standards
established
in
the
bank
merger
act
or
they
did
not.
now
let
us
assume
the
first
case
where
the
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
were
met
by
the
bank
regulatory
agency.
that
is,
its
determination
was
correctly
that
either
the
statute
did
not
substantially
lessen
competition
or
that
if
it
did
that
that
was
all
the
common
public
interest
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
in
that
event,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
states
that
the
courts
must
in
the
first
instance
apply
the
same
standard
and
in
the
--
section
7
(b),
and
section
7
(c)
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
provides
that
in
the
event
of
the
standards
of
bma
66
have
been
made
by
the
bank
regulatory
agency
that
the
department
of
justice
may
not
sue
on
any
other
action.
well,
the
net
effect
of
that
is,
if
the
bank
regulatory
agency
properly
met
the
standards
of
bma
66,
no
clayton
act
suit
could
be
reached,
no
clayton
act
decision
could
be
reached.
and
let's
take
the
other
side
of
that
point,
suppose
that
the
agency
was
incorrect,
and
it
could
not,
it
did
not
meet
the
standards
of
the
acts,
the
court
in
applying
the
standards
of
bma
66
as
instructed
in
section
7
(b)
would
so
find.
they
would
find
as
a
fact
that
the
agency
was
incorrect
and
it
should
not
have
approved
the
merger.
the
statute,
section
7
--
section
5
says,
the
agency
shall
not
approve
and
then
follows
the
test
that
we've
just
discused.
well,
if
the
agency
shall
not
approve
and
they
did
improperly
approved
and
the
court
so
finds
in
the
first
instance,
it
can
now
--
it
may
have
never
reached
a
clayton
7
issue
because
its
whole
case
is
before
--
is
decided
before
it.
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
says
the
agency
should
not
have
approved.
the
court
finds
the
fact
that
it
should
not
have
approved.
therefore
it
says
to
the
agency
and
to
the
banks,
"no,
you
may
not
go
through
with
this
merger
since
we
find
that
the
standards
of
the
act
were
not
met."
then
in
any
instance,
we
will
never
reach
a
clayton
7
case.
therefore,
that
internal
logic
makes
it
impossible
for
clayton
7
to
continue
to
apply.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
legislative
history
also
supports
that
mr.
justice
black
in
that
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
in
the
legislative
--
there
is
no
specific
language
that
says,
"we
are
now
in
this
process
repealing."
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
i
think
we
could've
avoided
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
if
it
had
said
that
sir.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
but
let
me
say
to
you
the
legislative
history
which
also
demonstrates
the
same
facts
mr.
justice
black.
in
the
legislative
history,
we
have
the
fact
that
the
ashley-ottinger
bill
which
is
--
which
was
essentially
the
bill
was
ultimately
enacted,
set
down
the
same
standards
that
are
in
this
bill
today.
and
it
said
--
it
stated
these
standards
in
the
terms
which
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
the
next
day
after
the
ashley-ottinger
bill
was
passed
by
the
committee,
the
representative
royce
proposed
an
amendment
to
the
ashley-ottinger
bill.
now
all
his
amendments
said
and
the
only
thing
it
said
was,
"let's
have
this
standard
of
section
5
(b)
apply
sections
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act."
that's
the
only
substantive
difference
between
representative
royce's
proposal
and
the
ashley-ottinger
bill.
now
that
proposal
of
representative
royce
was
rejected
by
the
committee.
and
that
they
say,
"the
only
difference
between
the
two
is
the
specific
reference
to
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
7
of
the
clayton
act."
now,
he
proposed
to
amend
5
by
also
specifically
stating
that
section
2
is
still
applied.
now
of
course
that
is
already
--
was
already
covered
in
ashley-ottinger
by
section
7
(a)
(b)
and
section
2
(a)
(b).
but,
to
the
court
--
so
the
congr--
the
committee
said,
"fine,
we'll
accept
your
amendment.
we'll
accept
your
addition
5
(a)."
it
made
no
substantive
difference
by
they
put
it
in.
the
only
thing
of
his
proposal
that
he
rejected
was
a
proposal
to
specifically
refer
to
the
act
--
the
action
in
the
antitrust
court
as
being
a
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
or
a
section
7
of
the
clayton
action.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
i
think
they
did
do
that
and
consciously
did
do
that.
i
just
think
--
they
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
neglected
to
say
it.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
we
get
that
from
the
logic
of
say
--
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
which
i
currently
going
to
do.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
unfortunate
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
unfortunately,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
have
language
on
either
direction.
i
suggest
that
the
only
logic
of
the
statute
and
the
only
legislative
history
supports
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
i
have
reached
regarding
this
into
which
i
have
already
adverted.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
first
case
in
which
section
7
was
charged
and
it
was
settled
before
it
reached
the
courts
was
transamerica
in
1959.
then,
of
course
we
had
our
(inaudible)
pennsylvania
bank
was
the
first
case
that
actually
reached
this
court
in
1963.
up
until
that
time,
it
had
been
thought
by
many
commentators
that
for
various
technical
reasons
that
the
bank
merger
--
that
bank
mergers
were
exempted
in
the
clayton
act.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
what
you're
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
you're
suggesting
a
repeal
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
don't
think
we
necessarily
reached
that
question.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
i
think
what
it
has
done
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
is
to
substitute
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
has
substituted.
it
has
substituted
other
antitrust
standards
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
for
the
antitrust
standards
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
well,
let
me
cite
the
language
of
the
statute
in
which
it
recites
some
clayton
act
standards
and
omits
others
and
it
adds
other
standards
to
the
previously
applicable
clayton
act
standard.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
takes
away
some
of
it
and
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
applies
--
it
applies
some
of
the
standards
where
section
7
had
used
and
takes
it
to
its
own
and
adapts
them
as
its
standards.
of
course,
in
the
chain
circumstances
of
this
act
which
establishes
its
own
frame
of
reference
within
which
to
examine
this
antitrust
criteria.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
it
--
our
view
of
that
is
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
our
view
of
that
is
simply
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
is
a
part
of
those
laws,
that
the
bank
merger
act
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
it
is
an
antitrust
law
which
applies
in
banking
specifically
for
banking
just
as
there
are
different
antitrust
standards
and
therefore
even
called
an
antitrust
laws
to
apply
to
various
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
if
you
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
if
you'll
note,
they
also
picked
up
language
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
which
purports
to
encompass
those
portions
of
the
sherman
1
standards
which
they
have
chosen
to
adopt.
now
of
course
the
scheme
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
is
to
preserve
entirely
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
it
specifically
refuses
to
concede
--
it
refuses
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
it
disclaims
any
change
in
the
applicability
of
that
state
--
standard.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
not
at
all,
mr.
justice.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that's
correct,
but
it
didn't
do
away
with
them
since
most
of
the
standards
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that's
right.
since
most
of
the
standards
were
picked
up
by
this
act,
we
really
feel
that's
merely
a
change
in
focus.
now,
the
second
question
which
arises
naturally
under
this
--
the
standard
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
review
that's
taken
place
here.
is
it
a
general
judicial
review
of
the
decision
of
the
regulatory
agency
wherein
the
court
reserves
to
itself
questions
of
law
and
statutory
standards?
or
is
it,
as
justice
claims,
not
a
review
at
all?
but
an
independent
inquiry
untainted
by
the
conclusions
of
the
bank
regulatory
agency,
a
mere
image
of
the
bank
merger
act
in
1960.
we
believe
that
the
procedure
of
difficulties
which
this
court
found
to
be
a
fatal
impediment
in
bma
60
have
been
cured
in
this
statute.
bank
regulatory
agencies
on
review
we
feel
then
should
have
the
same
treatment
accorded
them
as
other
regulatory
agencies.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
de
novo
standard
mr.
justice
black,
we
feel
relates
to
the
ability
to
introduce
new
facts.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
dictionary
says
the
word
de
novo
means
a
fresh.
we
feel
that
it's
quite
clear
that,
in
this
review,
unlike
many
agency
reviews
say
the
icc
or
the
fcc
where
the
court
is
precluded
from
inquiring
into
the
facts
either
by
these
terms
of
the
statute
or
by
judicial
interpretation
that
that
--
the
word,
the
effect
of
the
words
de
novo
in
this
statute
has
been
to
establish
that
the
court
is
not
so
precluded
in
this
instance
that
when
the
court
is
examining
this
decision
of
this
agency,
it
is
free
to
search
out
such
new
facts
as
it
may
bear
--
shed
light
upon
the
issues.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
required
to,
of
course
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
for
the
word
trial
de
novo
has
been
variously
interpreted
because
of
its
constitutional
difficulties,
initially
to
hold
a
trial
without
reference
to
the
decision
below
but
a
number
of
courts
in
order
to
preserve
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
well,
no,
a
number
of
courts
mr.
justice
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
a
number
of
courts
having
--
in
order
to
preserve
the
constitutionality
of
a
alleged
statutory
trial
de
novo
of
a
--
an
administrative
agency's
decision,
have
found
it
necessary
to
amend
judicially
that
the
term
trial
de
novo
to
mean
simply
that
they're
going
to
make
a
complete
inquiry
into
the
facts
but
they
will
not
substitute
their
judgment
to
that
of
the
agency
since
that
they
feel
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
as
this
court
stated
in
the
keller
case,
trial
de
novo
in
that
instance
is
acceptable
so
long
as
the
first
court
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
means,
as
we
indicated
earlier,
that
a
complete
new
trial
of
the
facts
and
the
law.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that's
correct.
but
that
only
in
those
instances
where
the
court
below
is
not
an
article
iii
court
because
then
you
run
into
the
same
question
in
the
court
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
in
that
context,
they
have
that
meaning.
i
think
simply
in
this
statute
we're
being
asked
to
determine
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
an
agency
determination
of
a
broad
discretionary
statutory
term
which
is
--
has
been
in
the
first
instance
referred
to
that
agency.
in
that
case,
i
suggest
this
court's
decision
in
the
last
term
in
atlantic
refining
where
it
said,
"when
the
congress
has
provided
that
administrative
agency
initially
apply
a
broad
statutory
term
to
a
particular
situation,
our
function
is
limited
to
determining
whether
the
commission's
decision
has
warrant
in
the
record
for
reasonable
basis
in
the
law."
i
feel
that
this
is
the
standard
to
what
you
should
have
continued
to
relate
yourselves.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
now,
the
lack
of
the
--
that
isn't
quite
true
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
there
is
a
provision
for
a
record
and
there
is
a
very
substantial
record
here
mr.
justice
white.
i
wanted
to
have
a
chance
to
correct
that
impression
you
may
have
gained.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
--
there
is
when
sought.
now
we
have
for
several
years
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
well,
there
was
not
one
in
this
case,
no
one
asked
for
one.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
no,
but
there
was
in
--
for
example
crocker.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
no,
i
do
not
think
the
statute
requires
a
hearing.
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
there
was
not
one
in
this
case
that
if
this
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
stand
--
you
suggested
sir
that
there
is
no
record
here.
there
was
a
very
substantial
record
developed
in
all
of
these
bank
mergers.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
that
can
be
held
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
question
it
advanced
was,
"is
it
fair,
can
we
make
our
determination
lacking
a
hearing?
is
justice
fairly
treated
in
not
having
a
hearing
in
these
cases
since
it
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
all
the
facts?"
but
it
can.
all
it
need
do
is
ask
for
a
hearing
and
as
an
aggrieved
party
our
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
our
regulations
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
prevent
them
to
hold
it.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
our
--
actually
in
these
two
cases
that
are
presently
before
this
court
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
alright,
in
the
houston
case,
an
application
was
received.
that
application
was
accompanied
by
a
substantial
economic
brief
in
which
the
agency
--
which
the
merging
bank
set
forth
their
contentions
as
to
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
and
as
to
the
competitive
effects
and
set
forth
a
numerous
statistics
as
to
the
structure
of
the
market
and
the
nature
of
the
city.
now
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that
is
a
sworn
statement.
at
--
in
the
first
instance
are
--
our
examination
is
a
--
the
--
an
examiner
is
sent
out
into
the
field
to
make
inquiry
as
to
the
accuracy
of
those
representing
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
that
was
not
in
this
case.
to
make
inquiry
and
to
do
accuracy
of
these
representations
and
also
to
test
the
community
reaction
to
the
merger
and
that
of
the
banks
as
well
or
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
pardon
me?
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
community
leaders
are
asked
their
reaction
to
this
particular
merger
whether
they
feel
it
would
help
or
hurt
or
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
development
of
the
community.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
everyone
of
the
principal
banks,
a
number
of
the
principal
businessmen
of
the
community
who
are
related
to
that
industry.
it's
a
substantial
inquiry.
it
takes
four
to
five
days
on
a
merger
of
this
size
for
the
examiner
to
make
his
survey
and
they
send
--
submits
a
report
of
that
to
the
regional
administrator
for
the
particular
region
in
which
he
operates
who
then
makes
a
cover
report
in
which
he
makes
his
recommendation.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
he
is
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
he
makes
the
(inaudible).
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
region
--
the
regional
administrator
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
regional
administrator
is
in
daily
contact
with
those
banks
which
he
supervises.
he
knows
them
all
personally,
he
works
with
them,
he
works
with
the
--
those
members
of
the
community
who
have
interest
in
banking
and
he
is
able
to
talk
through
his
dummy
conversations
with
everyone.
is
able
to
get
a
pretty
good
assessment
on
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
borrowers
or
one
of
the
groups
that
--
of
course
if
these
businessmen
aren't
borrowers,
they
are
one
of
the
groups
that
are
reached,
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
with
the
banking
community,
not
--
it's
not
--
not
at
all
with
the
particular
banks
involved
in
the
merger.
now,
when
the
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
we
do,
if
you
will
note
in
appendix
c
to
the
justice
department's
brief
starting
at
page
83,
there
is
about
25
pages
of
their
brief
relating
to
the
findings
that
we
made
in
houston.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
examiner
makes
findings
which
are
reviewed
by
the
regional
administrator
which
are
in
turn
reviewed
by
a
committee
at
--
in
our
washington
office,
which
makes
--
it's
only
an
independent
inquiry
into
what
it
feels
to
be
the
justifications.
he
makes
his
own
decisions.
each
one
of
those
members
of
the
committee
makes
his
own
observation
and
then
this
bulk
of
documentation,
its
presented
to
the
comptroller
for
his
ultimate
decision.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
and
if
this
was
a
review.
yes,
very
definitely
it
would
have
to
be.
if
it
is
not
a
review,
well
then
of
course
we
run
into
the
evidence
problems
that
as
(inaudible).
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
you
can't
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
you
can
put
it
into
evidence
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
you
can
put
into
evidence
mr.
justice
fortas
the
expertise
of
the
agency
and
the
literally
thousands
of
years
of
experience
in
relation
with
the
issues
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
that
the
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
--
the
officials
of
the
agency
have.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
as
a
technical
question
of
evidence,
i
would
say
that
in
the
event
that
the
nature
of
the
review
was
a
judicial
review
of
an
administrative
agency
determination,
i
should
say
that
that
would
be
evidential.
if
it
is
not,
i
think
--
suggest,
we
would
have
to
prove
all
of
these
all
over
again
and
much
of
it,
you
can't,
simply
cannot.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
much
of
that,
the
district
courts
wouldn't
allow
in,
much
of
it
is
second
hand.
it's
a
hearsay,
its
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
and
then
--
and
--
but
that
same
expert
judgment
is
applied
at
every
step
of
the
review
procedure
within
our
agency
up
through
to
fin
--
the
final
decision
by
the
comptroller
who
was
weighing
factors
that
perhaps
weren't
even
considered.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
ordinarily
of
course,
if
they
introduce
some
new
facts
we
feel
it
would
be
appropriate.
if
they
introduced
something
substantial,
it
really
--
we
had
not
considered
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
we
think
at
that
point,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
as
they
do
in
ordinary
judicial
reviews
to
remand
to
the
agency
for
consideration
of
these
new
facts
which
apparently
they
had
not
considered
below.
this
is
done
everyday
with
the
ftc
here
and
civil
hearings
and
reviews
of
other
agencies.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
he
does
not
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
he
does
not.
we
do
provide
for
hearings
at
the
request
of
any
party.
we
have
been
having
for
some
time
at
which
if
a
hearing
is
requested,
for
example
if
justice
had
requested
a
hearing
here,
they
would
have
had
a
formal
record,
witnesses
would
have
been
sworn
and
there
would
have
been
a
report
present
to
take
down
whatever
was
decided.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
and
there'll
be
cross
examination
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
is
not
required
by
the
law,
but
the
only
--
if
the
only
person
objecting
to
the
inadequacy
of
our
record
is
one
who
has
opportunity
to
make
that
record
complete,
we
suppose
that
that
individual
really
has
no
right
to
complain.
if
justice
doesn't
want
any
part
of
our
hearings,
in
the
crocker
case,
we
offered
them
to
come
in,
and
the
court
asked
them
to
come
in
and
they
refused.
they
--
he
felt
that
there
was
nothing
that
we
could
add
to
the
clayton
7
case
that
they
had
brought.
and
therefore
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
not
the
administrative
procedure
act
mr.
justice
white,
we
feel
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
oh,
or
we'd
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
there
has
been
a
considerable
body
of
law
developed
over
the
last
several
years.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
body
of
law,
developed
over
the
last
several
years
as
to
what
standards
we
--
our
hearings
must
hold.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
after
the
smithfield,
we
agreed
in
--
largely
with
smithfield.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
we
have,
there
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
there
has
been
--
there
are
some
50
cases,
branch
cases
in
the
lower
courts
now
at
which
our
hearing
procedures
are
very
much
at
issue
and
those
hearing
procedures
have
been
refined
over
the
years
after
smithfield
in
order
to
accommodate
the
question
raised
by
that
court.
our
hearing
procedures
are
substantial.
they
are
not
apa
and
in
a
complete
format,
but
they
do
apply
i
think
procedural
due
process
and
the
rights
to
all
--
with
the
parties.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
now
the
apa,
mr.
justice
white,
provides
something
quite
different.
the
apa
provides
that
it
will
review
and
it
will
sup
--
would
apply
an
administrative
accuracy
to
an
agency
action,
not
to
an
agency
hearing.
an
agency
action
is
to
find
as
anything
the
agency
may
do
which
finally
affects
the
rights
of
an
individual
even
to
doing
nothing.
now
we
certainly
can
hold
a
hearing
and
do
nothing
in
regard
to
that.
i
suggest
accordingly
that
that
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
due
process
of
right
that
comes
out
of
our
decisions
need
not
follow
a
hearing.
the
section
1009
of
title
5
which
is
the
apa
procedure
referred
to
permits
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
to
apply
to
a
decision
of
an
agency
which
is
not
a
decision,
which
may
be
a
determination
by
an
executive
sitting
behind
the
desk
with
no
record
of
any
kind.
it
may
be
a
failure
to
act
entirely.
it
may
be
an
action
that
has
some
hearing
proceedings
but
not
full
panoply.
it
could
be
just
about
anything.
so
i
don't
think
that
could
create
any
real
problem.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
if
i
may
have
several
minutes
to
do
that,
i
would
like
to
do
that.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
first
action,
the
--
april
5th,
1965,
mr.
--
senator
robertson
introduced
his
bill
of
1698.
this
bill
proposed
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
apply
to
banking
to
do
anything.
and
that
all
mergers
which
have
taken
place
before
may
3rd,
1960
would
be
considered
acceptable
and
could
not
be
attacked.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
this
was
amended
by
a
motion
of
senator
proxmire
in
june
of
1965
to
provide
that
justice
would
have
30
days
in
which
to
bring
a
sherman
1
or
clayton
7
action.
and
that
the
wiping
out
of
all
liability
on
previous
mergers
would
be
moved
up
from
may
3rd,
1962,
the
date
--
the
prospective
date
of
the
enactment
of
senator
proxmire's
bill.
this
bill
was
passed
by
voice
vote
of
the
senate
on
june
11th,
1965.
it
went
to
the
house
where
senator
--
where
representative
patman's
committee,
banking
and
finance
committee
of
the
house
took
it
under
advisement
and
representative
patman
did
his
best
to
bury
it
that
point.
i
think
it's
very
--
would
be
very
germane
if
the
court
would
study
appendices
a,
b,
and
c
of
our
brief
to
note
the
legislative
history
of
the
entrance
of
the
representative
robertson
to
representative
patman
to
avoid
any
bill
being
enacted.
now,
on
september
15,
1965,
representative
ashley,
who
had
taken
the
lead
from
bringing
any
bill
to
pass
in
this
--
in
the
house,
proposed
11011.
now
this
bill
provided
pretty
much
the
same
standards
that
are
in
bma
66,
but
it
did
provide
in
addition
that
the
agencies
were
to
home
a
full
apa
hearing
on
each
and
every
merger
proposal.
now,
as
you
know,
there
are
only
--
oh,
(inaudible)
in
a
moment.
the
justice
department
wrote
back
on
september
24th
and
suggested
that
this
would
be
inappropriate,
that
all
of
these
merger
hearings
were
not
really
relevant
that
in
only
a
few
instances
would
any
anti
--
serious
antitrust
questions
arise
therefore
it
would
be
economically
inadvisable
to
follow
the
full
apa
procedures
and
bank
mergers.
thereupon,
representative
ashley
rewrote
11011.
now,
he
didn't
change
the
basic
standards
of
the
act.
what
he
did
was
to
remove
the
full
apa
hearing
on
every
case.
now,
this
was
passed
by
the
committee,
this
ashley-ottinger
bill
was
passed
by
the
committee
on
october
19,
at
a
hearing
at
which
representative
patman
was
not
present,
a
majority
of
the
committee
was
there.
when
they
go
and
representative
patman
learned
that
the
committee's
hearingwas
in
session,
he
sent
representative
royce
into
the
committee
and
asked
for
that
--
the
hearing
be
dissolved
--
the
meeting
be
dissolved
as
not
in
accord
with
the
instructions
of
the
chairman.
the
committee
ignored
representative
royce's
proposal
and
passed
the
ashley-ottinger
bill
on
the
19th.
on
the
next
day
representative
royce
proposed
his
alternative
in
which
he
suggested
that
sections
1
and
section
7
be
reintroduced
into
the
standards.
you
will
recall
that
representative
--
senator
proxmire's
bill
would
have
applied
clayton
7
and
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
representative
ashley
took
it
out
of
his
bill.
representative
royce
proposed
to
put
it
back
in,
then
that
was
rejected
by
the
committee.
on
january
5th,
the
justice
department
proposed
to
representative
royce
a
bill
which
would
have
effectively
destroyed
the
bank
merger
act.
it
would
have
brought
it
back
to
the
position
right
after
the
pennsylvania
bank
case.
section
5
of
the
proposed
bill
by
justice
would
have
reduced
the
bank
merger
act
to
nothing
more
than
a
recognition
of
the
failing
company,
a
failing-company
doctrine.
now
that
was
the
basic
proposal
of
the
attorney
general
of
january
5th,
not
to
review
de
novo.
the
review
de
novo
in
section
7,
in
his
proposed
section
7
had
no
meaning
or
effect
at
all
if
they
could
get
the
congress
to
accept
the
failing
bank
doctrine
as
being
the
test
for
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
it
--
the
term
review
--
trial
de
novo
was
in
the
september
24th
letter
objecting
to
11011.
now
there
was
no
reference
of
any
kind
in
the
letter
of
january
5th
to
review
de
novo.
the
term
was
contained
in
the
attachment
to
say
as
--
dismissed
within
section
7
with
no
--
with
reference
in
the
text
to
the
letter
to
it
at
all.
the
text
of
the
letter
adverted
to
section
5
which
proposed
to
change
the
terms
of
what
became
bma
66
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
legislative
recognition
of
the
failing-company
doctrine
adopted
by
this
court
in
pennsylvania
bank.
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
the
language
of
review
de
novo
first
appears
in
the
record
in
the
attachment
to
the
january
5th
letter
of
the
department
of
justice.
we
suggested
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
we
suggested
--
mr.
eugene
j.
metzger
yes,
and
opposed
by
section
5
of
that
statute
proposing
that
the
bank
merger
act
in
effect
be
wiped
out
and
be
returned
back
to
the
pnb
decision.
now
that
was
the
basic
essential
position
taken
by
the
department.
the
review
de
novo
standard
would
not
have
hurt
the
department
at
all
if
it
(inaudible)
--
if
the
congress
had
accepted
the
section
5
then
proposed
by
--
thank
you
very
much.
