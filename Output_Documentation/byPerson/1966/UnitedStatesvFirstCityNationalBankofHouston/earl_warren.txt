mr.

you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wasn't
the
suggestion
that
they
amend
their
complaint
based
upon
on
the
assumption
that
they
would
carry
the
burden,
that
they
claim
in
this
court
they're
not
entitled
to
--
are
not
required
to
carry
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
really
did
determine
both
the
matter
of
pleading
and
the
burden
of
proof,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
they
had
amended,
he
would've
required
them
the
proof?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
the
issue
we're
determining
here.
chief

warren
the
judge
--
court
below
said
i
think
that
the
petition
fails
to
state
a
cause
of
action
in
that
it
alleges
only
the
first
step
and
not
the
second
step
which
is
necessary
for
the
plaintiff
to
support.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
government
had
amended
and
had
pleaded
the
second
step
that
the
complaint
would
still
be
defective?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
understood
in
the
colloquy
with
justice
brennan
that
if
a
--
if
they
used
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
at
all,
that
it
would
be
--
they
would
not
state
a
cause
of
action
they
had
to
do
it
solely
under
the
bank
merger
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
do
contend,
do
you
not
that
the
bank
merger
act
wiped
out
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
insofar
as
it
applied
to
bank
mergers?
chief

what
did
it
leave
in
section
7?
chief

warren
mr.

chief
justice

warren
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
position
that
--
mr.
metzger,
that
if
it
had
been
suggested
to
congress
that
it
specifically
repeal
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
so
far
as
bank
mergers
are
concerned,
that
congress
would've
done
that
in
order
to
carryout
the
effect
of
this
act
as
we
now
have
it.

do
we

where
do
we

chief

well,
i'd
like
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
stick
with
mr.

suggestion
that
you
go
to

rather
than
your
--
chief

view
of

be

can
you

does
