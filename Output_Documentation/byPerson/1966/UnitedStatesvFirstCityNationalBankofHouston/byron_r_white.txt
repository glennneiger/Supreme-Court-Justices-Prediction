justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
searls,
what
happens
when
a
merger
is
attacking
the
section
1
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
--
i
just
want
to
ask
you
about
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
if
someone
attacks
a
bank
merger
and
--
like
it
has
in
that
past
--
like
what's
happened
in
the
past,
what
--
do
you
think
there's
any
inquiry
in
the
line
of
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
section
1?
under
the
section
1
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
you
--
i'm
just
questioning
your
automatic
assumptions
because
the
words
line
of
commerce
were
omitted,
that
there
is
to
be
no
inquiry
in
the
line
of
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
other
antitrust
statutes
under
which
the
inquiry
is
made
when
there
is
no
words
like
--
there
are
no
words
like
that
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
wrong
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
they're
wrong
about
that,
then
on
what
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
because
you're
not
mentioning
the
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
are
wrong
on
that
mr.
searls,
would
you
rather
have
a
--
would
you
like
the
case
reversed
anyway
and
set
backs
the
government
can
amend?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
if
the
court
agreed
with
you,
the
government's
complaint
didn't
state
a
cause
of
action
but
agreed
with
the
government
that
it
--
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
to
amend,
would
you
then
say
send
it
back
and
then
have
it
come
back
up
here
on
the
same
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
rather
have
--
just
reach
the
other
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
how
do
--
how
does
the
department
bring
an
antitrust
action
under
the
--
i
suppose
the
act
contemplates
that
there
might
be
an
antitrust
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
merger
--
this
is
an
--
this
is
a
new
antitrust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
get
to
that
position,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise,
there
are
--
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
provisions
where
you
--
or
any
statutory
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
let
me
ask
--
before
you
get
to
that
--
at
least
there's
no
trial
type
hearing
before
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
in
the
philadelphia
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
statute
requires
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
wasn't
one
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
are
--
what's
the
argument
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
not
made
accurate,
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
was
behind
the
atlantic
refining
company
transaction
or
could
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
now
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tell
us
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
us
what
actually
happened
here,
i
mean
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
take
the
houston
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
examination
did
you
make
with
those
reference
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
department
of
justice
introduced
evidence
on
the
needs
of
the
community,
would
you
be
satisfied
on
the
rest
of
the
record
that
is
made
before
the
comptroller?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
want
to
rest
on
that
record
either
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
you
have
hearing
examiners
and
anything
--
are
you
setup
to
comply
with
the
administrative
procedures
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
could
that
require
a
hearing
--
establish
any
mechanic
for
a
hearing
before
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
would
you
be
subject
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
like
the
smithfield
case,
you
don't
agree
with
the
smithfield
case
apparently?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
he
had
corrected
everything,
since
you've
changed
your
procedure
quotes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
no
longer
applies?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
one
of
the
antitrust
actions
--
the
act,
specifically
refers
to
is
that
---
if
it
--
that
if
the
sherman
act
acted
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
a
--
one
of
the
bank
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
merger
act
indicated
is
the
needs
of
the
community,
so
to
speak,
taken
into
account,
namely
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
benefit
of
having
a
local
source
of
a
large
--
of
larger
loans
hadn't
been
able
to
be
made
locally
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
an
additional
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
an
additional
aspect
that
hasn't
been
or
--
you
haven't
normally
taken
into
account.
justice
byron
r.
white
yet,
i
believe
that
that
was
supposed
to
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
larger
might
attract
some
larger
industry.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
end
result
of
that
argument
is
that
that
the
comptroller's
decision
is
final.
i
would
take
it,
and
not
your
argument,
the
other
side
of
it,
but
it
is
unconstitutional
for
the
courts
to
consider
this
question
at
all.
does
it
mean
that
the
agency
decision
should
be
final,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
weight
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
suggest
--
justice
byron
r.
white
something
has
to
be
determined
de
novo
if
you
just
don't
give
weight
to
the
previous
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
indicates
the
court
might
--
would
have
--
would
make
its
own
assessment
of
these
facts.
here
are
the
facts
that
are
different
from
what
the
comptroller
found.
we
--
does
the
court
then
just
makes
its
own
determination
of
the
public
need
and
then
compare
it
with
the
comptroller?
or
does
it
say,
"well,
we
don't
have
to
make
any
determination
of
our
own.
we
don't
think
there's
enough
facts."
and
(inaudible)
destroyed
to
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
tell
whether
the
comptroller
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
saying
the
comptroller
is
that
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
some
of
the
facts
of
which
he
--
supposed
he
based
his
judgment
defend
that
proof.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
well,
then
you
would
say
that
if
you
pull
enough
props
up
the
court
would
say,
"well,
look
that
this
thing
has
to
go
back
here."
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
couldn't
--
you
say
he
didn't
--
couldn't
go
on
in
itself
decide
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
happens
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
act
requires
that
a
merger
be
judged
by
this
standard
in
bm
--
in
the
bma.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
how
can
you
disapprove
it
until
that
decision
is
made
possible?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
court
then
finds
the
factual
--
his
factual
basis
--
that
the
facts
he
offered
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
his
approval
then
--
is
then
you
say
vitiated.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
--
but
the
act
said
that
the
merger
should
be
approved
if
a
--
if
its
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
somebody
has
to
decide
--
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
the
banks
in
that
situation
would
not
does
not
have
the
right
to
present
their
own
case
to
the
court
on
public
need
and
to
make
any
argument
to
the
court
and
ask
the
court
itself
to
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
o'malley,
your
argument
does
--
doesn't
reach
the
capability
of
a
court
in
determining
the
competitive
factors
accruing
to
a
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
in
a
suit,
the
bank
with
a
bank
merger
attacking
the
comptroller,
it
is
alleged
that
the
comptroller
just
had
wrong
(inaudible)
on
the
competitive
factors
and
is
proved
that
he
is,
i
suppose
that
it
--
that
ends
the
case,
doesn't
it?
let's
assume
that
the
comptroller
has
concluded
that
effect
from
competition
will
be
ministered
as
it
did
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
pro-competitive
factors
are
such
that
the
net
effect
of
the
merger
will
be
pro-competitive.
let's
assume
that
the
court
--
i
suppose
that
they're
hoping
that
the
court
to
assess
those
arguments
and
those
conclusions
--
let's
assume
that
the
court
can
determine
that
the
comptroller
was
just
wrong
in
his
conclusions
about
the
competition,
then
he
really
hasn't
weigh
--
he
hasn't
weighed
the
public
need
against
the
right
thing,
hasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
what
happens
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
--
what
happens
then
if
the
court
makes
that
determination?
he
does
--
certainly
he
does
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
fact
to
the
comptroller
or
does
it
just
say,
"well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
merger
is
over
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
just
about
--
have
to
conclude
that
rather
than
say
to
the
court
could
then
weigh
the
competitive
effects
that
it
did
find,
i
think,
against
what
the
comptroller
said
to
public
needs.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
understand
in
this
case
that
the
comptroller
in
effect
found
that
the
--
that
there
was
--
that
there
--
that
wholly
aside
from
the
public
--
he
wouldn't
even
have
needed
the
--
he
wouldn't
have
had
to
get
to
public
need,
would
he?
he
in
effect
found
there
was
no
violation
of
an
antitrust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
is
really
saying
that
section
7,
if
there
were
a
section
7
cause
of
action
or
whatever
the
standard
is
that
there
was
just
no
violation
of
any
antitrust
standards.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
even
getting
to
public
needs.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
needn't
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
is
right,
there
was
no
competitive
impact.
he
didn't
need
to
talk
about
public
need
and
convenience.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
so
that
this
case
may
rest
on
whether
he
is
right
on
competitive
impact,
because
it
has
to
otherwise,
he
hasn't
weighed
the
needs
and
convenience
against
the
--
to
what
actually
may
happen.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
ends
up
like
concluding
that
the
effect
of
the
merger
is
pro-competitive.
justice
byron
r.
white
overall?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
a
line
of
commerce
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
you
have
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
the
line
of
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know.
but
when
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
still
have
to
talk
about
what
input
--
what
the
competitive
factors
you're
going
to
include
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
still
a
line
of
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
there
is
a
line
of
commerce
into
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes,
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
turner,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
already
told
us
that
--
i'm
just
curious,
expression
of
review
de
novo
originated
with
the
tests?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
to
indicate
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that
when
you
use
it,
you
had
in
mind
anything
like
the
former
review
that
the
comptroller
has
suggested
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
related
to
the
administrative
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
have
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
clearly
enough
that
you
had
to
use
the
review
by
trial,
but
you
don't
have
the
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
--
i
must
say
that
that
wouldn't
--
you
still
have
to
go
on
and
say
why
even
if
the
court
determines
everything
anew
about
any
regard
of
the
agency
determination.
and
you
still
have
--
admitting
as
you
do
that
the
bma
standard
applies.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
still
have
to
go
on
and
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
why
you
did
not
have
to
allege
and
prove
the
factors
which
go
into
--
all
of
the
factors
which
go
into
a
judgment
under
it
and
the
only
answer
you
have
to
say
to
that,
that
is
a
--
that
it's
a
--
just
traditionally
acceptance
to
antitrust
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
laws
must
be
alleged
and
proved
by
those
who
rely
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
particular
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
why
in
this
case
the
convenience
and
needs
in
any
balancing
is
relevant
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
comptroller
started
out
a
proposition
that
there
was
no
anticompetitive
effect.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
merger
has
a
favorable
effect
on
competition.
now,
you
have
to
get
by
that
--
(inaudible)
if
you
get
by
that,
at
the
outset,
the
case
is
over,
isn't
it?
because
you
allege
--
you
alleged
in
your
complaint
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
antitrust
laws,
section
7.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
you're
right
on
that,
he
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
is
that
wrong
in
that
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
that
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
the
court
make
their
own
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
on
the
terms
of
your
opposition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
on
their
own
terms
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
you
prove
that
there
were
anticompetitive
effects
on
their
approach
of
the
case,
the
case
is
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
say
the
commission
--
the
comptroller's
judgment
was
false
and
so
does
the
merger.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
their
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
put
it
the
other
way,
the
--
maybe
your
approach
doesn't
need
determination
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
searls,
what
happens
when
a
merger
is
attacking
the
section
1
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
--
i
just
want
to
ask
you
about
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
if
someone
attacks
a
bank
merger
and
--
like
it
has
in
that
past
--
like
what's
happened
in
the
past,
what
--
do
you
think
there's
any
inquiry
in
the
line
of
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
section
1?
under
the
section
1
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
you
--
i'm
just
questioning
your
automatic
assumptions
because
the
words
line
of
commerce
were
omitted,
that
there
is
to
be
no
inquiry
in
the
line
of
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
other
antitrust
statutes
under
which
the
inquiry
is
made
when
there
is
no
words
like
--
there
are
no
words
like
that
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
wrong
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
they're
wrong
about
that,
then
on
what
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
because
you're
not
mentioning
the
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
are
wrong
on
that
mr.
searls,
would
you
rather
have
a
--
would
you
like
the
case
reversed
anyway
and
set
backs
the
government
can
amend?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
if
the
court
agreed
with
you,
the
government's
complaint
didn't
state
a
cause
of
action
but
agreed
with
the
government
that
it
--
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
to
amend,
would
you
then
say
send
it
back
and
then
have
it
come
back
up
here
on
the
same
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
rather
have
--
just
reach
the
other
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
how
do
--
how
does
the
department
bring
an
antitrust
action
under
the
--
i
suppose
the
act
contemplates
that
there
might
be
an
antitrust
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
merger
--
this
is
an
--
this
is
a
new
antitrust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
get
to
that
position,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise,
there
are
--
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
provisions
where
you
--
or
any
statutory
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
let
me
ask
--
before
you
get
to
that
--
at
least
there's
no
trial
type
hearing
before
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
in
the
philadelphia
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
statute
requires
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
wasn't
one
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
are
--
what's
the
argument
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
not
made
accurate,
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
was
behind
the
atlantic
refining
company
transaction
or
could
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
now
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tell
us
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
us
what
actually
happened
here,
i
mean
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
take
the
houston
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
examination
did
you
make
with
those
reference
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
department
of
justice
introduced
evidence
on
the
needs
of
the
community,
would
you
be
satisfied
on
the
rest
of
the
record
that
is
made
before
the
comptroller?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
want
to
rest
on
that
record
either
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
you
have
hearing
examiners
and
anything
--
are
you
setup
to
comply
with
the
administrative
procedures
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
could
that
require
a
hearing
--
establish
any
mechanic
for
a
hearing
before
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
would
you
be
subject
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
like
the
smithfield
case,
you
don't
agree
with
the
smithfield
case
apparently?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
he
had
corrected
everything,
since
you've
changed
your
procedure
quotes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
no
longer
applies?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
one
of
the
antitrust
actions
--
the
act,
specifically
refers
to
is
that
---
if
it
--
that
if
the
sherman
act
acted
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
a
--
one
of
the
bank
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
merger
act
indicated
is
the
needs
of
the
community,
so
to
speak,
taken
into
account,
namely
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
benefit
of
having
a
local
source
of
a
large
--
of
larger
loans
hadn't
been
able
to
be
made
locally
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
an
additional
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
an
additional
aspect
that
hasn't
been
or
--
you
haven't
normally
taken
into
account.
justice
byron
r.
white
yet,
i
believe
that
that
was
supposed
to
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
larger
might
attract
some
larger
industry.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
end
result
of
that
argument
is
that
that
the
comptroller's
decision
is
final.
i
would
take
it,
and
not
your
argument,
the
other
side
of
it,
but
it
is
unconstitutional
for
the
courts
to
consider
this
question
at
all.
does
it
mean
that
the
agency
decision
should
be
final,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
weight
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
suggest
--
justice
byron
r.
white
something
has
to
be
determined
de
novo
if
you
just
don't
give
weight
to
the
previous
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
indicates
the
court
might
--
would
have
--
would
make
its
own
assessment
of
these
facts.
here
are
the
facts
that
are
different
from
what
the
comptroller
found.
we
--
does
the
court
then
just
makes
its
own
determination
of
the
public
need
and
then
compare
it
with
the
comptroller?
or
does
it
say,
"well,
we
don't
have
to
make
any
determination
of
our
own.
we
don't
think
there's
enough
facts."
and
(inaudible)
destroyed
to
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
tell
whether
the
comptroller
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
saying
the
comptroller
is
that
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
some
of
the
facts
of
which
he
--
supposed
he
based
his
judgment
defend
that
proof.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
well,
then
you
would
say
that
if
you
pull
enough
props
up
the
court
would
say,
"well,
look
that
this
thing
has
to
go
back
here."
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
couldn't
--
you
say
he
didn't
--
couldn't
go
on
in
itself
decide
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
happens
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
act
requires
that
a
merger
be
judged
by
this
standard
in
bm
--
in
the
bma.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
how
can
you
disapprove
it
until
that
decision
is
made
possible?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
court
then
finds
the
factual
--
his
factual
basis
--
that
the
facts
he
offered
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
his
approval
then
--
is
then
you
say
vitiated.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
--
but
the
act
said
that
the
merger
should
be
approved
if
a
--
if
its
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
somebody
has
to
decide
--
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
the
banks
in
that
situation
would
not
does
not
have
the
right
to
present
their
own
case
to
the
court
on
public
need
and
to
make
any
argument
to
the
court
and
ask
the
court
itself
to
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
o'malley,
your
argument
does
--
doesn't
reach
the
capability
of
a
court
in
determining
the
competitive
factors
accruing
to
a
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
in
a
suit,
the
bank
with
a
bank
merger
attacking
the
comptroller,
it
is
alleged
that
the
comptroller
just
had
wrong
(inaudible)
on
the
competitive
factors
and
is
proved
that
he
is,
i
suppose
that
it
--
that
ends
the
case,
doesn't
it?
let's
assume
that
the
comptroller
has
concluded
that
effect
from
competition
will
be
ministered
as
it
did
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
pro-competitive
factors
are
such
that
the
net
effect
of
the
merger
will
be
pro-competitive.
let's
assume
that
the
court
--
i
suppose
that
they're
hoping
that
the
court
to
assess
those
arguments
and
those
conclusions
--
let's
assume
that
the
court
can
determine
that
the
comptroller
was
just
wrong
in
his
conclusions
about
the
competition,
then
he
really
hasn't
weigh
--
he
hasn't
weighed
the
public
need
against
the
right
thing,
hasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
what
happens
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
--
what
happens
then
if
the
court
makes
that
determination?
he
does
--
certainly
he
does
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
fact
to
the
comptroller
or
does
it
just
say,
"well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
merger
is
over
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
just
about
--
have
to
conclude
that
rather
than
say
to
the
court
could
then
weigh
the
competitive
effects
that
it
did
find,
i
think,
against
what
the
comptroller
said
to
public
needs.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
understand
in
this
case
that
the
comptroller
in
effect
found
that
the
--
that
there
was
--
that
there
--
that
wholly
aside
from
the
public
--
he
wouldn't
even
have
needed
the
--
he
wouldn't
have
had
to
get
to
public
need,
would
he?
he
in
effect
found
there
was
no
violation
of
an
antitrust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
is
really
saying
that
section
7,
if
there
were
a
section
7
cause
of
action
or
whatever
the
standard
is
that
there
was
just
no
violation
of
any
antitrust
standards.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
even
getting
to
public
needs.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
needn't
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
is
right,
there
was
no
competitive
impact.
he
didn't
need
to
talk
about
public
need
and
convenience.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
so
that
this
case
may
rest
on
whether
he
is
right
on
competitive
impact,
because
it
has
to
otherwise,
he
hasn't
weighed
the
needs
and
convenience
against
the
--
to
what
actually
may
happen.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
ends
up
like
concluding
that
the
effect
of
the
merger
is
pro-competitive.
justice
byron
r.
white
overall?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
a
line
of
commerce
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
you
have
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
the
line
of
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know.
but
when
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
still
have
to
talk
about
what
input
--
what
the
competitive
factors
you're
going
to
include
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
still
a
line
of
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
there
is
a
line
of
commerce
into
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes,
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
turner,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
already
told
us
that
--
i'm
just
curious,
expression
of
review
de
novo
originated
with
the
tests?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
to
indicate
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that
when
you
use
it,
you
had
in
mind
anything
like
the
former
review
that
the
comptroller
has
suggested
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
related
to
the
administrative
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
have
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
clearly
enough
that
you
had
to
use
the
review
by
trial,
but
you
don't
have
the
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
--
i
must
say
that
that
wouldn't
--
you
still
have
to
go
on
and
say
why
even
if
the
court
determines
everything
anew
about
any
regard
of
the
agency
determination.
and
you
still
have
--
admitting
as
you
do
that
the
bma
standard
applies.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
still
have
to
go
on
and
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
why
you
did
not
have
to
allege
and
prove
the
factors
which
go
into
--
all
of
the
factors
which
go
into
a
judgment
under
it
and
the
only
answer
you
have
to
say
to
that,
that
is
a
--
that
it's
a
--
just
traditionally
acceptance
to
antitrust
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
laws
must
be
alleged
and
proved
by
those
who
rely
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
particular
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
why
in
this
case
the
convenience
and
needs
in
any
balancing
is
relevant
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
comptroller
started
out
a
proposition
that
there
was
no
anticompetitive
effect.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
merger
has
a
favorable
effect
on
competition.
now,
you
have
to
get
by
that
--
(inaudible)
if
you
get
by
that,
at
the
outset,
the
case
is
over,
isn't
it?
because
you
allege
--
you
alleged
in
your
complaint
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
antitrust
laws,
section
7.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
you're
right
on
that,
he
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
is
that
wrong
in
that
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
that
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
the
court
make
their
own
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
on
the
terms
of
your
opposition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
on
their
own
terms
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
you
prove
that
there
were
anticompetitive
effects
on
their
approach
of
the
case,
the
case
is
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
say
the
commission
--
the
comptroller's
judgment
was
false
and
so
does
the
merger.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
their
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
put
it
the
other
way,
the
--
maybe
your
approach
doesn't
need
determination
it
did.
