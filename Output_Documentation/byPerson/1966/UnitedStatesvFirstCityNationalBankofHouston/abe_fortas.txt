justice
abe
fortas
counsel
for
the
houston
banks
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
--
they
read
the
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
does
create
a
technical
problem,
does
it
mr.
turner?
that
is
to
say
the
government
brought
these
complaints
under
section
7
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
then
i
suppose
that
the
counsel
for
the
banks
felt
a
little
awkward
about
what
might
happen,
doesn't
it?
they
came
in
and
said
that
the
standards
of
another
statute
were
relevant
and
necessary
for
a
decision
of
the
case.
why
didn't
the
government
plead
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966?
justice
abe
fortas
you
now
say
that
those
were
the
--
you
concede
that
those
were
the
governing
standards.
justice
abe
fortas
no
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
any
judicial
proceeding.
did
i
read
it
correctly?
justice
abe
fortas
now
,
look
at
seven
--
page
70
of
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
the
merger?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
however
that
might
be,
what
you're
telling
us
now,
at
least,
clears
up
the
purposes
in
his
argument
whatever
its
effect
maybe
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
one
point
and
that
is
to
say
the
department
of
justice
agrees
that
the
standards
applicable
to
your
action.
so,
it
would
be
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
before
you
just
launch
on
this
aspect
from
your
argument.
i'm
still
concerned
by
the
fact
that
the
complaint
is
based
only
on
the
clayton
act
with
no
reference
to
the
provisions
of
the
bank
merger
act.
well,
let's
suppose
that
we
adopted
the
government's
position
here
subject
to
what
you
said
yesterday,
that
is
to
say
that
the
provisions
of
the
bank
merger
act
do
govern
here.
justice
abe
fortas
wouldn't
we
have
to
affirm
or
send
this
case
back
in
some
way
for
you
to
amend
your
complaint,
because
your
complaint
is
based
solely
on
the
clayton
act
and
there's
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
where
that
leaves
the
case
and
deal
with
your
--
the
statement
that
you
made
yesterday
which
i
think
is
quite
obvious
sad
to
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
bank
merger
act
does
govern
here.
i
don't
understand
why
the
government
brought
the
case
solely
as
a
clayton
act
case
if
the
provisions
of
the
bank
merger
act
governed,
and
if
the
provisions
of
the
bank
merger
act
governed
as
you
indicated
yesterday,
i
wonder
if
this
case
can
go
to
trial
under
this
complaint
when
if
it's
appropriate
for
the
case
to
go
to
trial
under
this
complaint.
justice
abe
fortas
the
judges
don't
usually
phrase
things
that
way,
mr.
turner,
in
my
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
experience
anyway.
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
a
banking
situation
that
makes
that
uniformity
more
desirable
than
in
other
parts
of
our
economy
that
tells
us
if
you
apply
for
the
argument
you've
just
made
to
other
parts
of
our
economy,
mr.
turner
has
suggested
that
you
have
been
--
reconsidered
all
the
problems
of
whether
the
quasi
judicial
administrative
agencies
aren't
desirable.
for
example
i
have
a
recollection
that
there
are
certain
overlaps
between
the
court
jurisdiction
at
the
instance
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
trade
commission,
and
what
you
just
said
if
you
sort
uniformity
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and,
you
say
it
can
be
achieved
only
as
a
result
of
a
court
decision,
i
would
think
that
they'd
have
a
fundamental
national
policy
to
be
reconsidered
or
are
you
saying
to
us
that
that
is
explicit
in
the
legislative
history
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
should
think
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
the
proposition
is
arguable
too.
i
mean,
you
said
exactly
the
converse
of
what
you
now
said.
but
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
whether
--
i
don't
remember
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
hearing
in
the
committee
reports,
do
you
have
it
briefed?
let's
see
--
you
have
it,
the
brief
to,
i'll
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
it
slipped
my
mind
now
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
construe
that
with
the
--
do
you
construe
that
as
either
not
to
mean
conflicts
between
the
executive
agencies
on
the
one
hand,
the
courts
on
the
other
hand?
that
i
didn't
get
when
i
read
that
provision.
justice
abe
fortas
your
argument
is
not
merely
that
there
are
conflicts
among
the
courts,
and
in
general,
the
sort
of
conflicts
that
we
have
in
applying
antitrust
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
standards
in
all
parts
of
our
economy.
and
your
argument
is
that
there's
a
conflict
between
the
courts
on
the
one
hand
and
the
executive
agencies
on
the
other
hand.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
searls,
what
do
you
do
at
the
first
paragraph
on
3
(a)
of
your
brief,
the
court
remarks?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
searls,
before
you
reach
that.
i
want
to
clarify
my
own
understanding
on
what
you're
saying
here.
as
i
have
thought
rather
that
there
were
two
separate
and
distinct
questions.
one,
regardless
of
what
is
in
the
bank
merger
act,
that
it
is
the
bank
merger
act
here
that
governs
rather
than
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
and
that
your
contention
is
that
this
complaint
is
fatally
defective
because
it
asked
that
--
it's
says
it
is
filed
under
section
15
of
the
clayton
act
to
prevent
and
restrain
the
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
act
of
december
29,
1950
period.
so
that
i
thought
that
number
one,
you
were
arguing
that
the
complaint
is
fatally
defective
because
it
seeks
to
restrain
the
violation
of
section
7
without
any
reference
for
the
--
under
the
bank
merger
act.
and
then
number
two,
is
separate
and
distinct
argument
relates
to
what
the
situation
would
be
if
the
bank
merger
act
had
been
pleaded
or
if
this
complaint
were
construed
so
as
in
some
way
to
plead
the
bank
merger
act.
and
on
that
second
leg
of
the
argument,
is
it
your
position
that
puts
the
government
is
in
disagreement
that
the
government
if
it
pleaded,
the
bank
merger
act
would
then
have
to
plead
both
the
competitive
impact,
competitive
effect,
and
the
failure
--
and
the
absence
of
offsetting
community
advantages.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
that
there
aren't
these
two
both
separate
attacks
on
the
complaint
and
not
just
one.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
metzger,
is
it
your
understanding
that
all
of
these
material
would
be
admissible
in
the
subsequent
court
proceeding
and
if
so,
on
what
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
it
has
now
been
proved
beyond
possibility
of
dispute,
that
there's
a
certain
amount
of
ambiguity
in
that
word
review.
and
what
the
--
on
what
query,
if
there
is
a
court
proceeding,
let
us
suppose
that
the
department's
view
is
right
and
that
what's
necessary
here
is
a
de
novo
proceeding
before
the
court
in
the
sense
that
once
the
justice
department
files
its
complaint,
the
proceeding
goes
ahead
like
any
other
section
7
case.
you
nevertheless
think
that
the
total
dossier
or
whatever
it
might
be
called
before
the
comptroller
could
be
put
in
evidence,
hearsay
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
rumor
or
everything
else?
justice
abe
fortas
huh?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
apart
--
justice
abe
fortas
apart
from
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
all
this
stuff
you
were
just
telling
us
--
how
about
all
the
stuff
you
were
just
telling
us
about?
justice
abe
fortas
the
reactions
of
business
leaders
and
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
do
about
the
elimination
of
the
phrase
in
any
line
of
commerce?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
but
mr.
turner
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
those
words
which
appear
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
section
7
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
do
not
appear
in
the
bank
merger
act
--
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
correct,
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
section
7
uses
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce,
the
bank
merger
act
in
stating
what
appears
to
be
the
exact
standard
of
section--
justice
abe
fortas
--
7,
eliminates
those
words.
well,
isn't
that
--
is
my
understanding
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
is
(inaudible)
--
it
is
omitted.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
--
take
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
look
at
page
69
of
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
5
(b)
the
standard
is
set
out.
justice
abe
fortas
and
down
to
the
word
unless
it
tracks
the
words
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
except
that
the
qualifying
phrase
in
any
line
of
commerce
is
left
out.
justice
abe
fortas
now
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
arguable
that
that
is
a
very
important
indication
that
this
is
a
different
--
a
new
standard
that
the
congress
enacted
and
is
applicable
to
bank
mergers
in
displacement
of
the
section
7
clayton
act
standard.
i'm
not
saying
that
that
is
so
and
--
that
i
do
suggest
that
that
is
a
point
that
you
have
to
meet
because
if
that
is
so,
then
the
conclusion
may
follow
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
the
governing
standard
in
bank
mergers
should
be
the
bank
merger
act
rather
than
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
unfortunately,
we
don't
have
to
face
up
to
that
right
now.
justice
abe
fortas
our
problem
is
whether
the
omission
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
that
language
does
or
does
not
indicate
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
that
the
applicable
standard
for
whatever
it
might
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
mean
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
a
bma
standard
rather
than
the
section
7
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
only
relevance
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
it
has
here
as
i
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
think
that
the
underlying
material
considered
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
would
be
admissible
in
the
court
proceeding,
that
is
to
say
the
in
--
the
sort
of
information
that
mr.
metzger
is
talking
about,
the
views
of
people
in
the
area,
businessmen
and
so
on
and
collect
them,
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
really
what
i'm
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
wouldn't
be
--
that
also
is
a
problem.
the
problem
is
whether
in
your
view
of
this
case
you
would
attach
any
significance
whatever
to
the
issue
of
the
word
review,
that
is
to
say
whether
you
would
say,
i
concede
for
example
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
you
might
say
that
we
do
concede
that
review,
the
word
review
has
some
significance
in
the
sense
that
the
material
that
was
before
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
as
well
as
his
report
or
decision
or
whatever
it
was
would
be
a
part
of
the
court
record.
i
think
that's
a
real
problem
as
to
what
the
word
review
means
and
as
far
as
i
understand
it
you
take
the
position
that
review
de
novo
of
the
issues
gives
no
means
that
no
effect
whatever
will
be
given
to
the
proceedings
before
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
and
that
is
a
--
that's
the
question
which
i
really
directing
my
inquiry.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner,
before
you
get
through,
i
would
like
to
hear
from
you
as
to
what
happens
in
bank
merger
cases
now
under
this
act
or
otherwise
with
respect
to
the
private
suits?
and
second,
i
suppose
that
the
banking
agency
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
or
otherwise
turns
down
the
merger,
does
that
mean
that
the
banks
cannot
go
ahead
with
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that
they
don't
have
any
--
do
they
have
any
judicial
review?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
that
be
done?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
that
come
about?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let's
have
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
if
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
i
don't
know
whether
there's
any
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
to
this
effect
but
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
one
way
to
construe
the
review
de
novo
provision
of
the
bank
merger
act
is
that
--
it
was
intended
to
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
mean,
just
to
see
if
i
could
state
a
little
more
clearly
that
what
you're
not
telling
us
is
that
if
the
banking
agency
disapproves
a
merger
proposal,
the
parties
can
then
go
into
the
district
court
and
that
the
standard
in
the
district
court
will
be
whether
the
agency
action
is
arbitrary
etcetera.
but
now
you
tell
us
that
--
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
possibility
that
whether
that
same
standard
could've
been
applied
here
where
the
banking
--
bank
merger
act
says
that
if
the
department
of
justice
starts
a
suit
to
the
court,
the
court
shall
review
de
novo
the
issues
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
presented.
justice
abe
fortas
oh
no,
no,
no,
no,
the
--
that's
not
involved
here
at
all.
the
question
is
whether
the
court
review
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
an
agency
approved
as
to
be
--
it
should
be
governed
by
the
same
standards
as
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
court
review
of
an
agency
discipline.
i
am
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
the
question
is
whether
that
is
what
congress
intended
in
using
these
curious
words,
review
de
novo,
with
the
issues
presented.
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
i
see
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
i
see
my
problem.
i
had
not
regarded
the
antitrust
provision
as
a
sole
custodian
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
there
are
statutes
of
the
federal
trade
commission
and
jurisdiction,
phrase
of
the
agencies,
and
here,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
this
particular
case
that
they
had
been
jury
--
in
primary
jurisdiction
administrate
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no
(inaudible)
--
mr.
turner,
the
court
would
still
review
it
and
it's
the
legal
standard
presumably,
the
ultimate
custodianship
of
the
legal
standard
would
be
in
the
court.
even
if
the
court
reviews
under
the
standards
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
question
is
really,
it
would
--
seems
to
me,
one
of
--
who
is
going
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
particular
facts
before
would
fall
within
appropriate
legal
standards.
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
agencies
are
there
that
are
given
power
to
make
a
final
determination
of
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
now
what
did
he
--
is
that
what
he
concluded?
justice
abe
fortas
the
statute
says
that
he
is
not
to
approve
the
merger
if
its
effect
is
anticompetitive
this
--
in
shorthand,
unless
he
finds
that
they
are
outweighing
factors
of
public
interest,
the
convenience
and
the
need.
now,
what
--
how
do
you
construe
the
comptroller's
general
action?
did
he
conclude
that
there
are
no
--
that
there's
no
anticompetitive
factor
here
that
requires
disapproval
or
did
he
rely
on
the
--
on
less
qualities?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
why
you
read
it
and
maybe
to
be
the
way
i
read
it,
but
if
you
talk
about
the
court
proceeding
as
a
review
proceeding
in
any
sense,
then
your
next
question
is.
what's
he
reviewing?
what's
the
court
reviewing?
what
conclusion
or
what
finding
is
the
court
reviewing?
and
that's
why
i
confess
to
some
difficulty
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
comptroller's
opinion
--
because
it
seems
to
me
is
something
about
--
and
i
think
it's
the
last
paragraph
or
next
to
the
last
paragraph.
what
he
did
was
precisely
what
you've
just
stated
which
is
to
say
that
on
the
of
this,
it
looks
okay.
and
instead
of
saying
that
i
have
--
in
terms
of
statutory
standards,
i
find
that
it's
not
anticompetitive
or
alternatively
saying
that
while
i
find
that
it's
anticompetitive,
there
are
offsetting
factors.
excuse
me,
i
mean
in
this
connection,
was
it
in
the
other
case
where
there
was
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
saxon
and
then
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
supplementary
opinion
by
his
successor.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
it's
awful
and
messy
in
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
does
on
the
one
hand
--
if
the
comptroller
had
said,
"yes,
sir,
it
had
the
anticompetitive
effects,
but
under
the
last
clause,
i
find
that
they
are
offset
by
the
public
interest."
then
you
could
spend
from
that
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
government
should
have
made
an
allegation
in
its
complaint
directed
to
that,
which
is
the
substance
of
your
position
as
i
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
can't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
i
thought
the
courts
have
been
doing
this
act.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
i
thought
the
courts
have
been
doing
this
--
that
for
a
great
many
years
in
the
antitrust
field.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
(voice
overlap)
--
if
it's
unconstitutional,
but
i
think
there
has
been
a
lot
of
it
around.
justice
abe
fortas
why
didn't
they
--
what
--
tell
me,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
this
--
because
of
your
argument,
but
can
you
tell
me
on
what
basis
the
comptroller
decided
this
case?
did
he
decide
it
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
anticompetitive
effect
or
did
he
decide
it
on
the
grounds
of
the
unless
clause,
that
there
was
no
overriding
public
interest?
justice
abe
fortas
he
then
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
he
then
say
which
he
used,
does
he?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
show
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
show
me
where
he
states
that
conclusion?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
my
problem
because
i'm
restricted
to
words.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
exactly
that
confuses
me.
justice
abe
fortas
the
application
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
therefore
approved?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
mind
if
i
ask
you
something
about
the
preceding
case,
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
it's
my
recollection,
i
may
be
wrong
that
there
is
--
that
in
the
findings
and
opinion
of
comptroller
saxon,
when
he
was
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
he
said
that
--
i
find
in
effect,
i
find
there
no
anticompetitive
effects,
but
if
they
--
they're
offset
by
the
public
interest
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
i
remember
this,
it's
very
rough.
and
then
his
successor
in
the
supplementary
opinion
said
that,
i
find
there
are
no
anticompetitive
effects
and
i
don't
have
to
reach
the
unless
clause.
do
you
know
whether
that
is
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
very
different
from
what
we
have
in
this
case
as
i
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
well,
i
bring
it
up
just
because
there
we
at
least,
if
my
recollection
is
correct
to
what
it
may
be
worth,
we
do
have
a
specific
formulation
that
i
can
understand
i
think
as
to
the
statutory
provision
from
which
the
decision
turns
namely
that
there
are
no
anticompetitive
effects
as
it
came
out
in
the
watch.
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
we
don't
have
that
as
i
--
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
of
this
opinion.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
all
wrapped
up
with
the
public
interest
so
you
can
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
move
the
other
way
you
want
to.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
mean
at
the
end
of
the
year,
there
were
35
more
banks
and
they
have
been
given
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
the
mergers
are
banks
that
merged?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
to
go
in
that
field,
banks
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
so
it's
--
so
you
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
about
--
so
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
net
deficits
of
banks?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
wouldn't
it
be
exactly
--
justice
abe
fortas
wouldn't
it
be
exactly
the
same
problem
if
there
is
under
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
event
that
the
comptroller
refused
to
approve
a
merger?
and
now
the
banks
since
started
a
proceeding
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
don't
you
have
all
--
having
these
problems
all
over
again
right
there?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
agree
that
that
proceeding
would
lie
as
i
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
questions
we
asked
is
now
--
and
it's
turning
bad
as
i
see
it.
the
question
for
us
is
that
whether
in
using
these
strange
words,
the
strange
combination
of
words
in
the
bank
merger
act
is
--
congress
intended
for
us
to
say
that
yes,
a
procedure
for
review
de
novo
of
the
issues
involved
here
is
--
needs
that
there'll
be
a
proceeding
alike
the
proceeding
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner
if
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
said
"no",
refused
to
approve
the
merger
and
that
the
banks
then
resorted
to
a
district
court
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
district
court
applying
--
would
then
go
on
with
the
comptroller's
action
trying
to
find
out
whether
it
was
arbitrary.
suppose
that
the
district
court
did
find
that
it
was
arbitrary
and
held
that
the
merger
should
be
approved,
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
district
court
could
so
order
or
would
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
district
court
reverse
and
remain
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
may
have
been
--
it
may
have
been
that
these
were
words
of
legislative
diplomacy
rather
than
words
of
legal
art.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then,
it
was.
justice
abe
fortas
counsel
for
the
houston
banks
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
--
they
read
the
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
does
create
a
technical
problem,
does
it
mr.
turner?
that
is
to
say
the
government
brought
these
complaints
under
section
7
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
then
i
suppose
that
the
counsel
for
the
banks
felt
a
little
awkward
about
what
might
happen,
doesn't
it?
they
came
in
and
said
that
the
standards
of
another
statute
were
relevant
and
necessary
for
a
decision
of
the
case.
why
didn't
the
government
plead
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966?
justice
abe
fortas
you
now
say
that
those
were
the
--
you
concede
that
those
were
the
governing
standards.
justice
abe
fortas
no
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
any
judicial
proceeding.
did
i
read
it
correctly?
justice
abe
fortas
now
,
look
at
seven
--
page
70
of
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
the
merger?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
however
that
might
be,
what
you're
telling
us
now,
at
least,
clears
up
the
purposes
in
his
argument
whatever
its
effect
maybe
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
one
point
and
that
is
to
say
the
department
of
justice
agrees
that
the
standards
applicable
to
your
action.
so,
it
would
be
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
before
you
just
launch
on
this
aspect
from
your
argument.
i'm
still
concerned
by
the
fact
that
the
complaint
is
based
only
on
the
clayton
act
with
no
reference
to
the
provisions
of
the
bank
merger
act.
well,
let's
suppose
that
we
adopted
the
government's
position
here
subject
to
what
you
said
yesterday,
that
is
to
say
that
the
provisions
of
the
bank
merger
act
do
govern
here.
justice
abe
fortas
wouldn't
we
have
to
affirm
or
send
this
case
back
in
some
way
for
you
to
amend
your
complaint,
because
your
complaint
is
based
solely
on
the
clayton
act
and
there's
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
where
that
leaves
the
case
and
deal
with
your
--
the
statement
that
you
made
yesterday
which
i
think
is
quite
obvious
sad
to
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
bank
merger
act
does
govern
here.
i
don't
understand
why
the
government
brought
the
case
solely
as
a
clayton
act
case
if
the
provisions
of
the
bank
merger
act
governed,
and
if
the
provisions
of
the
bank
merger
act
governed
as
you
indicated
yesterday,
i
wonder
if
this
case
can
go
to
trial
under
this
complaint
when
if
it's
appropriate
for
the
case
to
go
to
trial
under
this
complaint.
justice
abe
fortas
the
judges
don't
usually
phrase
things
that
way,
mr.
turner,
in
my
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
experience
anyway.
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
a
banking
situation
that
makes
that
uniformity
more
desirable
than
in
other
parts
of
our
economy
that
tells
us
if
you
apply
for
the
argument
you've
just
made
to
other
parts
of
our
economy,
mr.
turner
has
suggested
that
you
have
been
--
reconsidered
all
the
problems
of
whether
the
quasi
judicial
administrative
agencies
aren't
desirable.
for
example
i
have
a
recollection
that
there
are
certain
overlaps
between
the
court
jurisdiction
at
the
instance
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
trade
commission,
and
what
you
just
said
if
you
sort
uniformity
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and,
you
say
it
can
be
achieved
only
as
a
result
of
a
court
decision,
i
would
think
that
they'd
have
a
fundamental
national
policy
to
be
reconsidered
or
are
you
saying
to
us
that
that
is
explicit
in
the
legislative
history
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
should
think
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
the
proposition
is
arguable
too.
i
mean,
you
said
exactly
the
converse
of
what
you
now
said.
but
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
whether
--
i
don't
remember
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
hearing
in
the
committee
reports,
do
you
have
it
briefed?
let's
see
--
you
have
it,
the
brief
to,
i'll
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
it
slipped
my
mind
now
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
construe
that
with
the
--
do
you
construe
that
as
either
not
to
mean
conflicts
between
the
executive
agencies
on
the
one
hand,
the
courts
on
the
other
hand?
that
i
didn't
get
when
i
read
that
provision.
justice
abe
fortas
your
argument
is
not
merely
that
there
are
conflicts
among
the
courts,
and
in
general,
the
sort
of
conflicts
that
we
have
in
applying
antitrust
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
standards
in
all
parts
of
our
economy.
and
your
argument
is
that
there's
a
conflict
between
the
courts
on
the
one
hand
and
the
executive
agencies
on
the
other
hand.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
searls,
what
do
you
do
at
the
first
paragraph
on
3
(a)
of
your
brief,
the
court
remarks?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
searls,
before
you
reach
that.
i
want
to
clarify
my
own
understanding
on
what
you're
saying
here.
as
i
have
thought
rather
that
there
were
two
separate
and
distinct
questions.
one,
regardless
of
what
is
in
the
bank
merger
act,
that
it
is
the
bank
merger
act
here
that
governs
rather
than
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
and
that
your
contention
is
that
this
complaint
is
fatally
defective
because
it
asked
that
--
it's
says
it
is
filed
under
section
15
of
the
clayton
act
to
prevent
and
restrain
the
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
act
of
december
29,
1950
period.
so
that
i
thought
that
number
one,
you
were
arguing
that
the
complaint
is
fatally
defective
because
it
seeks
to
restrain
the
violation
of
section
7
without
any
reference
for
the
--
under
the
bank
merger
act.
and
then
number
two,
is
separate
and
distinct
argument
relates
to
what
the
situation
would
be
if
the
bank
merger
act
had
been
pleaded
or
if
this
complaint
were
construed
so
as
in
some
way
to
plead
the
bank
merger
act.
and
on
that
second
leg
of
the
argument,
is
it
your
position
that
puts
the
government
is
in
disagreement
that
the
government
if
it
pleaded,
the
bank
merger
act
would
then
have
to
plead
both
the
competitive
impact,
competitive
effect,
and
the
failure
--
and
the
absence
of
offsetting
community
advantages.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
that
there
aren't
these
two
both
separate
attacks
on
the
complaint
and
not
just
one.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
metzger,
is
it
your
understanding
that
all
of
these
material
would
be
admissible
in
the
subsequent
court
proceeding
and
if
so,
on
what
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
it
has
now
been
proved
beyond
possibility
of
dispute,
that
there's
a
certain
amount
of
ambiguity
in
that
word
review.
and
what
the
--
on
what
query,
if
there
is
a
court
proceeding,
let
us
suppose
that
the
department's
view
is
right
and
that
what's
necessary
here
is
a
de
novo
proceeding
before
the
court
in
the
sense
that
once
the
justice
department
files
its
complaint,
the
proceeding
goes
ahead
like
any
other
section
7
case.
you
nevertheless
think
that
the
total
dossier
or
whatever
it
might
be
called
before
the
comptroller
could
be
put
in
evidence,
hearsay
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
rumor
or
everything
else?
justice
abe
fortas
huh?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
apart
--
justice
abe
fortas
apart
from
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
all
this
stuff
you
were
just
telling
us
--
how
about
all
the
stuff
you
were
just
telling
us
about?
justice
abe
fortas
the
reactions
of
business
leaders
and
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
do
about
the
elimination
of
the
phrase
in
any
line
of
commerce?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
but
mr.
turner
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
those
words
which
appear
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
section
7
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
do
not
appear
in
the
bank
merger
act
--
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
correct,
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
section
7
uses
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce,
the
bank
merger
act
in
stating
what
appears
to
be
the
exact
standard
of
section--
justice
abe
fortas
--
7,
eliminates
those
words.
well,
isn't
that
--
is
my
understanding
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
is
(inaudible)
--
it
is
omitted.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
--
take
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
look
at
page
69
of
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
5
(b)
the
standard
is
set
out.
justice
abe
fortas
and
down
to
the
word
unless
it
tracks
the
words
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
except
that
the
qualifying
phrase
in
any
line
of
commerce
is
left
out.
justice
abe
fortas
now
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
arguable
that
that
is
a
very
important
indication
that
this
is
a
different
--
a
new
standard
that
the
congress
enacted
and
is
applicable
to
bank
mergers
in
displacement
of
the
section
7
clayton
act
standard.
i'm
not
saying
that
that
is
so
and
--
that
i
do
suggest
that
that
is
a
point
that
you
have
to
meet
because
if
that
is
so,
then
the
conclusion
may
follow
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
the
governing
standard
in
bank
mergers
should
be
the
bank
merger
act
rather
than
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
--
and
unfortunately,
we
don't
have
to
face
up
to
that
right
now.
justice
abe
fortas
our
problem
is
whether
the
omission
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
that
language
does
or
does
not
indicate
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
that
the
applicable
standard
for
whatever
it
might
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
mean
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
a
bma
standard
rather
than
the
section
7
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
only
relevance
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
it
has
here
as
i
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
think
that
the
underlying
material
considered
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
would
be
admissible
in
the
court
proceeding,
that
is
to
say
the
in
--
the
sort
of
information
that
mr.
metzger
is
talking
about,
the
views
of
people
in
the
area,
businessmen
and
so
on
and
collect
them,
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
really
what
i'm
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
wouldn't
be
--
that
also
is
a
problem.
the
problem
is
whether
in
your
view
of
this
case
you
would
attach
any
significance
whatever
to
the
issue
of
the
word
review,
that
is
to
say
whether
you
would
say,
i
concede
for
example
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
you
might
say
that
we
do
concede
that
review,
the
word
review
has
some
significance
in
the
sense
that
the
material
that
was
before
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
as
well
as
his
report
or
decision
or
whatever
it
was
would
be
a
part
of
the
court
record.
i
think
that's
a
real
problem
as
to
what
the
word
review
means
and
as
far
as
i
understand
it
you
take
the
position
that
review
de
novo
of
the
issues
gives
no
means
that
no
effect
whatever
will
be
given
to
the
proceedings
before
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
and
that
is
a
--
that's
the
question
which
i
really
directing
my
inquiry.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner,
before
you
get
through,
i
would
like
to
hear
from
you
as
to
what
happens
in
bank
merger
cases
now
under
this
act
or
otherwise
with
respect
to
the
private
suits?
and
second,
i
suppose
that
the
banking
agency
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
or
otherwise
turns
down
the
merger,
does
that
mean
that
the
banks
cannot
go
ahead
with
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that
they
don't
have
any
--
do
they
have
any
judicial
review?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
that
be
done?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
that
come
about?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let's
have
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
if
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
i
don't
know
whether
there's
any
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
to
this
effect
but
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
one
way
to
construe
the
review
de
novo
provision
of
the
bank
merger
act
is
that
--
it
was
intended
to
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
mean,
just
to
see
if
i
could
state
a
little
more
clearly
that
what
you're
not
telling
us
is
that
if
the
banking
agency
disapproves
a
merger
proposal,
the
parties
can
then
go
into
the
district
court
and
that
the
standard
in
the
district
court
will
be
whether
the
agency
action
is
arbitrary
etcetera.
but
now
you
tell
us
that
--
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
possibility
that
whether
that
same
standard
could've
been
applied
here
where
the
banking
--
bank
merger
act
says
that
if
the
department
of
justice
starts
a
suit
to
the
court,
the
court
shall
review
de
novo
the
issues
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
presented.
justice
abe
fortas
oh
no,
no,
no,
no,
the
--
that's
not
involved
here
at
all.
the
question
is
whether
the
court
review
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
an
agency
approved
as
to
be
--
it
should
be
governed
by
the
same
standards
as
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
court
review
of
an
agency
discipline.
i
am
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
the
question
is
whether
that
is
what
congress
intended
in
using
these
curious
words,
review
de
novo,
with
the
issues
presented.
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
i
see
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
i
see
my
problem.
i
had
not
regarded
the
antitrust
provision
as
a
sole
custodian
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
there
are
statutes
of
the
federal
trade
commission
and
jurisdiction,
phrase
of
the
agencies,
and
here,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
this
particular
case
that
they
had
been
jury
--
in
primary
jurisdiction
administrate
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no
(inaudible)
--
mr.
turner,
the
court
would
still
review
it
and
it's
the
legal
standard
presumably,
the
ultimate
custodianship
of
the
legal
standard
would
be
in
the
court.
even
if
the
court
reviews
under
the
standards
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
question
is
really,
it
would
--
seems
to
me,
one
of
--
who
is
going
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
particular
facts
before
would
fall
within
appropriate
legal
standards.
justice
abe
fortas
how
many
agencies
are
there
that
are
given
power
to
make
a
final
determination
of
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
now
what
did
he
--
is
that
what
he
concluded?
justice
abe
fortas
the
statute
says
that
he
is
not
to
approve
the
merger
if
its
effect
is
anticompetitive
this
--
in
shorthand,
unless
he
finds
that
they
are
outweighing
factors
of
public
interest,
the
convenience
and
the
need.
now,
what
--
how
do
you
construe
the
comptroller's
general
action?
did
he
conclude
that
there
are
no
--
that
there's
no
anticompetitive
factor
here
that
requires
disapproval
or
did
he
rely
on
the
--
on
less
qualities?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
why
you
read
it
and
maybe
to
be
the
way
i
read
it,
but
if
you
talk
about
the
court
proceeding
as
a
review
proceeding
in
any
sense,
then
your
next
question
is.
what's
he
reviewing?
what's
the
court
reviewing?
what
conclusion
or
what
finding
is
the
court
reviewing?
and
that's
why
i
confess
to
some
difficulty
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
comptroller's
opinion
--
because
it
seems
to
me
is
something
about
--
and
i
think
it's
the
last
paragraph
or
next
to
the
last
paragraph.
what
he
did
was
precisely
what
you've
just
stated
which
is
to
say
that
on
the
of
this,
it
looks
okay.
and
instead
of
saying
that
i
have
--
in
terms
of
statutory
standards,
i
find
that
it's
not
anticompetitive
or
alternatively
saying
that
while
i
find
that
it's
anticompetitive,
there
are
offsetting
factors.
excuse
me,
i
mean
in
this
connection,
was
it
in
the
other
case
where
there
was
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
saxon
and
then
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
supplementary
opinion
by
his
successor.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
it's
awful
and
messy
in
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
does
on
the
one
hand
--
if
the
comptroller
had
said,
"yes,
sir,
it
had
the
anticompetitive
effects,
but
under
the
last
clause,
i
find
that
they
are
offset
by
the
public
interest."
then
you
could
spend
from
that
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
government
should
have
made
an
allegation
in
its
complaint
directed
to
that,
which
is
the
substance
of
your
position
as
i
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
can't
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
i
thought
the
courts
have
been
doing
this
act.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
i
thought
the
courts
have
been
doing
this
--
that
for
a
great
many
years
in
the
antitrust
field.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
(voice
overlap)
--
if
it's
unconstitutional,
but
i
think
there
has
been
a
lot
of
it
around.
justice
abe
fortas
why
didn't
they
--
what
--
tell
me,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
this
--
because
of
your
argument,
but
can
you
tell
me
on
what
basis
the
comptroller
decided
this
case?
did
he
decide
it
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
anticompetitive
effect
or
did
he
decide
it
on
the
grounds
of
the
unless
clause,
that
there
was
no
overriding
public
interest?
justice
abe
fortas
he
then
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
he
then
say
which
he
used,
does
he?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
show
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
show
me
where
he
states
that
conclusion?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
my
problem
because
i'm
restricted
to
words.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
exactly
that
confuses
me.
justice
abe
fortas
the
application
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
therefore
approved?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
mind
if
i
ask
you
something
about
the
preceding
case,
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
it's
my
recollection,
i
may
be
wrong
that
there
is
--
that
in
the
findings
and
opinion
of
comptroller
saxon,
when
he
was
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
he
said
that
--
i
find
in
effect,
i
find
there
no
anticompetitive
effects,
but
if
they
--
they're
offset
by
the
public
interest
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
i
remember
this,
it's
very
rough.
and
then
his
successor
in
the
supplementary
opinion
said
that,
i
find
there
are
no
anticompetitive
effects
and
i
don't
have
to
reach
the
unless
clause.
do
you
know
whether
that
is
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
very
different
from
what
we
have
in
this
case
as
i
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
well,
i
bring
it
up
just
because
there
we
at
least,
if
my
recollection
is
correct
to
what
it
may
be
worth,
we
do
have
a
specific
formulation
that
i
can
understand
i
think
as
to
the
statutory
provision
from
which
the
decision
turns
namely
that
there
are
no
anticompetitive
effects
as
it
came
out
in
the
watch.
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
we
don't
have
that
as
i
--
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
of
this
opinion.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
all
wrapped
up
with
the
public
interest
so
you
can
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
move
the
other
way
you
want
to.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
mean
at
the
end
of
the
year,
there
were
35
more
banks
and
they
have
been
given
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
the
mergers
are
banks
that
merged?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
to
go
in
that
field,
banks
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
so
it's
--
so
you
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
about
--
so
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
net
deficits
of
banks?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
wouldn't
it
be
exactly
--
justice
abe
fortas
wouldn't
it
be
exactly
the
same
problem
if
there
is
under
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
event
that
the
comptroller
refused
to
approve
a
merger?
and
now
the
banks
since
started
a
proceeding
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
don't
you
have
all
--
having
these
problems
all
over
again
right
there?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
agree
that
that
proceeding
would
lie
as
i
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
questions
we
asked
is
now
--
and
it's
turning
bad
as
i
see
it.
the
question
for
us
is
that
whether
in
using
these
strange
words,
the
strange
combination
of
words
in
the
bank
merger
act
is
--
congress
intended
for
us
to
say
that
yes,
a
procedure
for
review
de
novo
of
the
issues
involved
here
is
--
needs
that
there'll
be
a
proceeding
alike
the
proceeding
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turner
if
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
said
"no",
refused
to
approve
the
merger
and
that
the
banks
then
resorted
to
a
district
court
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
district
court
applying
--
would
then
go
on
with
the
comptroller's
action
trying
to
find
out
whether
it
was
arbitrary.
suppose
that
the
district
court
did
find
that
it
was
arbitrary
and
held
that
the
merger
should
be
approved,
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
district
court
could
so
order
or
would
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
district
court
reverse
and
remain
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
may
have
been
--
it
may
have
been
that
these
were
words
of
legislative
diplomacy
rather
than
words
of
legal
art.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then,
it
was.
