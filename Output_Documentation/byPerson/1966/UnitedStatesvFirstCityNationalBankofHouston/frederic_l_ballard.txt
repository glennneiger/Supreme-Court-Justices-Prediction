mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
a
question
raised
by
justice
black
--
seems
to
mr.
justice
black
--
what
seems
to
me
to
be
--
go
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
as
i
recall
his
question
it
was,
has
anyone
--
any
court
ever
suggested
that
the
kind
of
weighing,
the
kind
of
public
policy,
public
interest
determination
which
is
made
in
this
act
is
beyond
the
ordinary
competence
of
a
court.
and
of
course
the
answer
is
clearly
yes,
that
was
suggested
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
and
i
know
that
you
are
all
familiar
with
the
language
but
perhaps
i
will
read
it
anyway.
we
are
clear
however
that
a
merger,
the
effect
of
which
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
is
not
safe
because
on
some
ultimate
reckoning
of
social
or
economic
debits
and
credits,
it
may
be
deemed
beneficial.
a
value
choice
of
such
magnitude
is
beyond
the
ordinary
limits
of
judicial
competence
and
in
any
event
has
been
made
for
us
already
by
congress
when
it
act
--
enacted
the
amended
section
7.
now,
in
a
nutshell
your
honors,
our
position
is
that
when
congress
enacted
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
it
restored
that
ultimate
reckoning
of
social
or
economic
debits
and
credits
required
that
to
be
made
and
it
required
the
court
to
take
some
part
in
that
process.
that
brings
me
to
the
second
point.
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
black
also
who
asked
whether
the
act
allows
the
banking
agency,
either
the
federal
reserve
board,
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
or
the
comptroller
to
approve
a
merger
even
though
it
would
clearly
and
unquestionably
violate
section
7
or
section
1.
and
the
answer
is
perfectly
clearly
yes,
there
is
a
clear
warrant
in
the
statute
for
the
banking
agency
to
approve
a
merger
even
though
it'd
be
an
anticompetitive
merger.
and
thus,
as
far
as
the
banking
agency
is
concerned,
the
situation
is
on
all
force
with
the
situation
before
the
icc
or
before
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
the
--
and
we
are
in
the
same
situation
that
you
are
in
the
seaboard,
the
ultimate
decision
here
is
not
whether
this
merger
would
violate
section
7
or
section
1,
the
ultimate
determination
here
is
whether
this
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.
now,
i
have
said
that
there
is
no
doubt
the
agency
has
the
power
to
approve
such
a
merger
and
this
brings
me
to
the
third
question
which
are
the
question
which
both
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
fortas
have
alluded
to
and
that
is
what
finality
should
be
accorded
to
that
determination
by
the
agency?
now,
i
feel
this
has
--
there
are
two
factors
to
this.
one,
how
good
is
the
procedure
before
the
agency
and
what
kind
of
a
review
procedure
should
there
be
before
the
court?
perhaps
we
can
illustrate
that
best
by
the
facts
of
this
case
by
which
i
mean
the
provident
case
as
they
are
set
forth
in
the
rather
extensive
appendix
which
we
have
filed
with
our
brief.
you
will
see
that
the
commencement
of
an
application
is
an
economic
brief
which
in
this
case
ran
approximately
60
pages
long
and
in
which
the
parties
are
directed
to
address
themselves
to
the
issues
of
competition
and
public
convenience
and
necessity.
following
this,
the
agency
receives
reports
from
the
other
agencies
on
the
factor
of
competition
but
not
the
factor
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
i
stress
this
because
there
is
a
tendency
to
feel
that
if
one
of
the
other
agencies
has
called
the
attention
to
what
it
conceives
to
be
serious
competitive
effects
of
this
merger
that
then
when
the
agency
charged
with
the
ultimate
determination
approves
the
merger
that
in
some
way
it
is
overruling
or
disregarding
reviews
of
the
other
agency,
this
is
not
necessarily
so.
the
first
agency
which
it
rendered
the
advisory
report
is
limited
only
to
competition
and
does
not
express
its
views
on
convenience
and
needs.
now,
the
next
step
as
far
as
the
banks
are
concerned
is
to
supplement
their
presentation
and
in
our
case
we
were
not
able
to
print
for
you
the
very
extensive
supplementary
material.
this
material
was
designed
to
answer
every
question
which
the
comptroller
had
raised
and
to
answer
every
question
which
the
federal
--
apparently,
the
federal
reserve
board
had
raised
in
its
advisory
opinion,
we
feel
that
it
did
that.
most
of
that
material
went
to
the
department
of
justice,
not
all
of
it
but
all
that
we
felt
the
department
would
be
interested
in.
concurrently
with
this,
there
is
an
investigation
which
a
--
is
a
private
investigation
by
the
banking
agencies.
mr.
metzger
has
indicated
to
you
the
general
nature
of
it.
the
--
i
believe
that
mr.
o'malley
will
be
arguing
for
the
comptroller
in
this
case
may
go
a
little
more
--
deeper
into
it.
i
found
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
committee
on
s.
1698
at
page
899
a
long
description
of
the
investigative
procedure
conducted
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
i
think
you
will
--
as
you
read
this
description,
you
will
feel
that
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
and
the
comptroller,
and
the
federal
reserve
board
make
a
thorough
effort
to
verify
the
factual
material
that
is
asserted
in
the
application
and
to
find
out
what
the
effect
of
the
merger
will
be
on
the
community
in
general.
now,
they
do
not
hold
a
hearing.
routinely,
they
do
not
hold
a
hearing.
they
can
hold
hearing,
but
they
usually
don't.
the
reason
why
they
don't
do
this
is
i
think
obvious,
if
you
start
to
think
about
the
kinds
of
issues
that
are
before
them.
a
bank
--
first
of
all,
a
bank
operates
in
a
fishbowl.
its
statistics,
all
the
facts
that
are
known
to
it
are
common
knowledge
to
the
examiners.
when
the
examiners
come
in
as
they
do
twice
a
year,
when
the
examiners
come
in
for
a
special
application
on
a
merger,
the
bank
tells
the
examiner
anything
he
wants
to
know.
so
the
facts
at
issue,
the
facts
in
an
application
are
rarely
at
issue
--
the
deposits
and
loans,
the
ratios,
where
the
bank
does
business,
all
these
kind
of
thing
are
known.
the
second
thing
about
a
bank
is
it's
a
creature
of
confidence.
it
maintains
its
business.
it
keeps
its
depositors,
it
keeps
its
customers,
only
so
long
as
they
have
complete
confidence
in
the
bank
that
they're
dealing
with.
now
many
of
the
factors
that
will
be
involved
in
any
agency,
in
any
merger,
are
factors
as
to
which
confidence
is
important.
of
course,
if
you
have
a
bank
that
is
failing
or
floundering,
the
last
thing
you
want
is
an
evidentiary
type
of
hearing
at
which
that
will
be
discussed.
but
it
goes
much
deeper
than
that.
if
a
bank
feels
that
the
merger
will
improve
the
quality
of
its
service,
it
is
extremely
difficult
in
an
evidentiary
type
hearing
to
explain
that
without
explaining
at
the
same
time
that
there
is
something
substandard
about
its
present
service.
this
may
boil
all
very
well
if
you
know
the
merger
is
going
through.
but
if
you
don't
know
the
merger
is
going
through,
this
may
just
be
the
thing
that
will
not
only
lose
confidence
for
the
bank,
but
make
the
service
deteriorate
further
because
the
man
and
the
bank
who
is
--
department
you
have
even
indirectly
run
down
may
very
well
not
be
there
the
next
day,
he
may
find
another
bank
that
appreciates
his
services
more.
so
there
is
excellent
reason
why
the
hearings
have
traditionally
been
dispensed
with
in
bank
cases.
now
then,
what
does
the
statute
do
about
this?
and
i'm
now
speaking
about
this
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
court
below
because
that
after
all
is
the
question
in
the
provident
case.
judge
clarie
had
all
these
problems
to
wrestle
with
and
he
wrestled
with
them
over
a
long
period
of
time,
and
he
came
out
with
a
interpretation
of
these
--
of
the
act
which
makes
very
good
sense.
judge
clarie
and
this
statute
say,
"since
there
was
no
hearing
below,
we
will
afford
a
hearing
in
the
district
court,
not
the
circuit
court
because
circuit
courts
normally
don't
take
testimony.
we
will
have
a
hearing
in
the
district
court.
and
that
hearing,
every
issue
that
has
come
up
in
the
course
of
the
application
can
be
reviewed
and
the
parties
are
free
to
put
in
any
in
--
any
testimony
they
want."
now,
when
we
trench
upon
the
confidential
areas,
i
assume
that
the
court
will
treat
that
in
camara
with
all
the
confidentiality
that
is
necessary.
now,
judge
clarie
goes
further
than
that.
he
says
that,
"at
the
hearing
the
court
will
find
the
facts.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
substantiate
--
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
in
this
case,
judge
clarie
ruled,
"the
court
will
find
the
facts
only
when
you
get
to
the
area
of
discretion,
whatever
it
may
be,
will
the
court
vow
to
the
comptroller's
expertise,
the
comptroller's
informed
judgment."
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
as
i
envision
this
procedure
your
honor,
the
issues
would
involve
as
mr.
turner
had
said,
essentially
factual
things,
to
take
a
rather
simple
one,
will
there
be
a
substant
--
with
substantial
economies
relating
to
this
merger.
now
these
--
the
existence
of
this
issue
is
identified
in
the
application
itself
and
it
is
further
elaborated
in
pretrial
proceedings
including
a
lengthy
pretrial
brief.
now,
the
parties
will
be
free
if
the
department
of
justice
wishes
to
challenge
that
factual
issue,
they
can
bring
in
all
the
testimony
they
want
and
prove
that
they
can,
that
there
will
be
no
incompetence.
another
issue
in
this
case
is
that
the
bank
served
different
portions
of
the
city
(voice
overlap).
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
there
will
be
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
well
i
think
in
this
situation,
we
would
be
about
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
where
justice
--
where
mr.
turner
was,
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
comptroller's
evidence
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
believe
that
would
be
right
sir.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
ultimate
question,
you
see
what
we
have,
we
have
here
an
ultimate
determination
by
the
comptroller
that
this
merger
weighing
all
these
factors,
some
pro,
some
con,
some
rather
speculative,
some
immediate.
he
has
--
you
have
an
ultimate
determination
that
that
is
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
he
decided
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
mr.
justice
fortas
what
i
think
he
did
is
this,
and
it's
very
easy
to
do.
i
think
he
took
the
pro-competitive,
the
pro-competitive
effect
of
the
merger
and
balanced
it
first
against
the
anticompetitive
effect
and
came
out
with
a
conclusion
that
the
overall
effect
on
competition
was
favorable.
then
he
added
a
few
more
points.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
think
what
he
is
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
that
was
in
the
other
case
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
in
this
case
your
honor,
it
is
of
course
true
that
he
did
not
follow
precisely
the
statutory
scheme
and
we
perhaps
all
could
wish
that
he
had.
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
he
identified
the
factors
which
in
his
view
made
this
merger
in
the
public
interest.
he
identified
a
pro-competitive
effect.
he
identified
efficiencies.
he
identified
improved
quality
of
service.
he
analyzed
the
anticompetitive
effects
which
have
been
pointed
out
to
him
in
which
are
--
which
would
be
there
under
a
--
under
the
complaint
in
this
case.
he
analyzed
that.
and
he
came
out
when
he
was
through
with
a
final
answer,
with
a
final
conclusion
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
and
that
we
would
be
hurting
the
economy
of
philadelphia
if
(voice

--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
your
honor
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
well,
your
honor
in
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
--
in
our
case
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
in
our
case,
as
you
know,
the
complaint
was
upheld
over
our
objection,
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
notice
of
pleading
and
that
we
knew
what
the
charge
against
us
was.
but
when
you
come
down
to
this
posture
of
the
case
as
it
is
presented
to
this
court,
there
is
no
question
about
these
things.by
this
time,
two
things
had
happened.
the
court
had
ordered
parties
to
set
forth
the
issues
and
the
facts
on
which
they
were
reminded.
and
so
in
this
case,
if
the
department
of
justice
had
any
issues
to
take,
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
refine
and
define
those
issues
so
that
when
it
went
before
the
court,
the
court
would
know
where
the
parties
were
in
dispute
as
to
either
what
the
facts
were
or
what
weight
should
be
assigned
to
it.
the
second
thing
that
had
happened
in
this
case
is
there
had
been
a
complete
discovery
and
the
department
had
asked
--
had
filed
lengthy
interrogatories
asking
--
going
down
through
the
application
itself
and
asking
what
is
the
ground
for
this
contention,
what
is
the
ground
for
that
contention,
what
is
the
ground
for
the
next
contention?
so
that
by
the
time
this
case
was
presented
to
judge
clarie,
there
had
been
ample
opportunity
to
get
at
the
precise
issues
that
i
think
about
are
new,
mr.
justice
fortas.
and
to
go
back
i
feel
that
under
judge
clarie's
ruling
here,
what
is
entitled
to
weight
is
the
comptroller's
ultimate
determination
based
on
this
mosaic
of
considerations
and
to
the
extent
that
the
department
would
be
successful
in
the
trial
in
taking
the
underpinning
out
from
under
that
determination.
they
might
show
that
they've
pulled
enough
from
the
box
out
from
underneath
it
that
he
was
wrong,
that
he
didn't
follow
the
statute's
plea
standard.
he
didn't
properly
understand
it
or
even
properly
follow
it.
but
to
the
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
don't
think
a
court
can
make
its
own
determination
of
public
need,
mr.
justice
black.i
really
don't
see
it
has
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
as
i
have
said
that
in
order
to
find
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
no,
sir
i
don't
believe
so,
i
mean
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
no
sir,
that's
--
my
point
is,
i
feel
that
if
--
i
--
you
misunderstood
me.
my
point
is
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
--
that
if
you
pull
the
props
up
from
under
the
comptroller's
determination
and
if
you
get
enough
props,
his
determination
would
fall
there.
i
think
that's
what
the
standard
of
review
is
here,
or
if
you
prove
that
he
acted
capriciously
arbitrarily.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
it
could
say
that
if
it
felt
that
that
was
a
part
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
they
could
say
that
the
basis
for
his
determination
had
been
so
destroyed
that
his
determination
was
outside
the
bound
for
his
discretion.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
think
the
--
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
i
don't
think
it
has
--
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
court
would
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
don't
follow
your
question.
the
--
in
my
hypothetical
case,
the
comptroller
has
purported
to
do
that.
in
fact
that's
what
he
has
done.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
situation
they
are
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
no
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
excuse
me
your
honor.
the
act
doesn't
say
that.
the
act
says
that
the
comptroller
may
not
approve
an
anticompetitive
merger.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
unless.
and
therefore
if
you
find
that
all
the
props
are
pulled
out
from
under
his
arguments
on
convenience
and
needs,
it
seems
to
me
that
then
he
may
not
approve
the
merger
--
the
merger
be
approved
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
he
is
wrong?
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
no
your
honor,
i
would
--
i
felt
that
before
you
pull
the
props
out,
you
give
the
banks
a
chance
to
be
heard.
that
is
i
think
the
--
and
i
--
this
is
what
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
this
is
what
judge
clarie
envisioned.
he
envisioned
that
the
department
of
justice
would
put
in
its
contentions
on
the
facts
and
then
the
banks
would
put
in
theirs,
and
the
comptroller
would
put
in
his
if
you
will
and
when
it
was
through,
the
court,
i
take
it
would
decide
whether
there
was
warrant
for
the
comptroller's
opinion
in
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court,
this
being
the
smithfield
apa
procedure.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i'm
not
sure
of
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
have
the
case
before
me.
the
case
before
me
i
have
judge
clarie's
ruling.
i
have
his
handling
of
the
hearing
matter.
now,
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
the
comptroller
stands.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
he
has
to
consider
all
cases
and
i
think
perhaps
he
takes
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
well,
your
honor,
in
our
case,
the
court
announced
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
it
was
going
to
make
a
redetermination
of
the
facts.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
sir,
we
didn't
get
to
the
evidence
point.
the
court
announced
that
that
was
the
kind
of
a
hearing
it
was
going
to
--
to
hold.
then
it
asked
the
parties
to
submit
the
outlines
of
the
testimony
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
and
when
the
department
of
justice
submitted
its
outline
of
testimony,
it
stated
that
it
was
not
going
to
submit
any
testimony
as
to
the
existence
or
the
significance
of
factors
of
convenience
and
need.
and
at
this
point,
the
banks
moved
for
a
final
judgment,
the
nature
of
a
judgment
that
you
would
make
after
the
plaintiff
has
finished
his
case
and
when
he
has
not
met
the
burden
of
proof
assigned
to
him
and
the
judge
made
--
entered
a
final
judgment
in
our
favor
on
that
basis.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
now,
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
take
one
minute
more
to
answer
one
other
question
that
came
up
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
with
mr.
turner.
i
wish
that
--
i
wish
i
had
more
time
to
go
into
the
question
of
what
the
nature
of
this
public
policy
determination,
but
it
is
covered
in
our
brief.
perhaps,
this
one
question
will
illustrate
it
as
well
as
anything
else.
they
had
a
discussion
here
about
merger
(inaudible).
and
there
was
a
discussion
about
--
well,
if
the
loan
isn't
available
in
this
city
then
it
will
be
available
in
that
city,
and
if
it
isn't
available
for
one
bank,
it
will
be
available
for
several
banks.
now,
this
may
be
probably
is
the
standard
antitrust
analysis
of
a
market
situation.
perhaps
it's
even
an
economic
analysis
if
it
not
be
a
banking
analysis.
to
a
bank,
there
are
--
there
is
--
there
are
two
forms
of
large
amount.
one
is,
when
you
are
just
the
participant,
when
you
just
have
a
share
of
the
amount
and
this
is
nice
but
it
isn't,
it
doesn't
--
it
does
not
improve
the
quality
of
service
of
the
bank
very
much.
the
other
position
is
the
lead
position.
in
the
lead
position,
you
are
the
man
--
if
your
people
who
work
at
the
time
(inaudible),
to
work
with
the
borrower,
to
decide
what
is
the
most
appropriate
form
of
loan
to
have,
and
whether
they
--
whether
the
financing
should
be
in
one
piece,
all
the
intricacies
that
are
becoming
more
and
more
apparent
in
bank
lending.
now,
it's
the
biggest
bank,
that
is
the
lending
--
the
leading
bank
in
almost
every
case.
we
have
cases
in
our
--
in
our
submission
here
for
the
situation
where
a
bank
starts
out
as
a
lead
bank
and
its
men
are
getting
this
kind
of
training
and
expertise.
and
then
other
banks
are
brought
in
because
our
bank
can
no
longer
satisfy
the
customer's
demands
and
then
bigger
banks
are
brought
in.
and
finally,
they
get
a
bigger
share.
and
then,
what
happens?
our
bank
is
no
longer
the
lead
bank.
now
this
is
bad
not
only
for
our
bank
but
for
our
community
because
the
reputation
of
our
bank
as
a
leading
bank,
a
bank
with
skilled
personnel,
expert
in
these
situations,
is
what
brings
business
to
our
community.
more
than
that,
that
same
expertise
that
they
developed
in
these
big
situations
are
used
in
their
smaller
amounts,
so
that
when
we
get
edged
out
of
the
lead
position,
the
quality
of
our
service,
the
expertise
of
our
people,
our
prestige,
and
our
ability
to
serve
our
smaller
customers
all
suffer.
now
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
comptroller
knows,
the
federal
reserve
board
knows
instinctively,
this
is
the
warp
and
woof
of
banking.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
district
court
knows,
and
with
all
due
deference
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
department
of
justice
seems
to
pay
its
attention.
and
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
think
the
congress
had
in
mind,
when
it
said
that
a
merger
should
be
judged
on
the
public
interest,
as
the
interest
of
the
total
community,
weighing
any
anticompetitive
needs
--
effects
against
--
the
beneficial
effects
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
thank
you.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
think
the
main
purpose
of
this
bill
justice
black
was
to
restore
the
public
interest,
the
test
of
public
interest
to
these
situations
as
a
result
of
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
the
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
think
there
was
a
very
important
point
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
your
honor
it
is
an
extremely
important
point.
the
only
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
and
i
think
one
of
the
other
purposes
as
stated
by
senator
robertson,
when
he
first
--
put
the
first
bill
and
it's
to
restore
the
(inaudible)
of
public
interest.
and
that
i
think
is
the
reason
why
the
court
below
is
correct
when
it
said
that
the
view
taken
here
by
the
department
of
justice
which
just
ignores
the
expertise
of
the
federal
banking
agencies,
just
ignores
them,
treats
them
the
way
we
treat
magistrate
courts
in
philadelphia.
that
i
think
--
it
was
--
it's
--
the
court
is
correct
in
holding
that
that
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
difference
usually
given,
let's
say,
the
federal
reserve
board
and
we
don't
have
any
question
about
people
in
this
particular
case,
it's
just
not
in
accordance
with
the
deference
given
to
them
and
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
normal
function
of
a
district
court
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
a
question
raised
by
justice
black
--
seems
to
mr.
justice
black
--
what
seems
to
me
to
be
--
go
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
as
i
recall
his
question
it
was,
has
anyone
--
any
court
ever
suggested
that
the
kind
of
weighing,
the
kind
of
public
policy,
public
interest
determination
which
is
made
in
this
act
is
beyond
the
ordinary
competence
of
a
court.
and
of
course
the
answer
is
clearly
yes,
that
was
suggested
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
and
i
know
that
you
are
all
familiar
with
the
language
but
perhaps
i
will
read
it
anyway.
we
are
clear
however
that
a
merger,
the
effect
of
which
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
is
not
safe
because
on
some
ultimate
reckoning
of
social
or
economic
debits
and
credits,
it
may
be
deemed
beneficial.
a
value
choice
of
such
magnitude
is
beyond
the
ordinary
limits
of
judicial
competence
and
in
any
event
has
been
made
for
us
already
by
congress
when
it
act
--
enacted
the
amended
section
7.
now,
in
a
nutshell
your
honors,
our
position
is
that
when
congress
enacted
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
it
restored
that
ultimate
reckoning
of
social
or
economic
debits
and
credits
required
that
to
be
made
and
it
required
the
court
to
take
some
part
in
that
process.
that
brings
me
to
the
second
point.
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
black
also
who
asked
whether
the
act
allows
the
banking
agency,
either
the
federal
reserve
board,
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
or
the
comptroller
to
approve
a
merger
even
though
it
would
clearly
and
unquestionably
violate
section
7
or
section
1.
and
the
answer
is
perfectly
clearly
yes,
there
is
a
clear
warrant
in
the
statute
for
the
banking
agency
to
approve
a
merger
even
though
it'd
be
an
anticompetitive
merger.
and
thus,
as
far
as
the
banking
agency
is
concerned,
the
situation
is
on
all
force
with
the
situation
before
the
icc
or
before
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
the
--
and
we
are
in
the
same
situation
that
you
are
in
the
seaboard,
the
ultimate
decision
here
is
not
whether
this
merger
would
violate
section
7
or
section
1,
the
ultimate
determination
here
is
whether
this
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.
now,
i
have
said
that
there
is
no
doubt
the
agency
has
the
power
to
approve
such
a
merger
and
this
brings
me
to
the
third
question
which
are
the
question
which
both
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
fortas
have
alluded
to
and
that
is
what
finality
should
be
accorded
to
that
determination
by
the
agency?
now,
i
feel
this
has
--
there
are
two
factors
to
this.
one,
how
good
is
the
procedure
before
the
agency
and
what
kind
of
a
review
procedure
should
there
be
before
the
court?
perhaps
we
can
illustrate
that
best
by
the
facts
of
this
case
by
which
i
mean
the
provident
case
as
they
are
set
forth
in
the
rather
extensive
appendix
which
we
have
filed
with
our
brief.
you
will
see
that
the
commencement
of
an
application
is
an
economic
brief
which
in
this
case
ran
approximately
60
pages
long
and
in
which
the
parties
are
directed
to
address
themselves
to
the
issues
of
competition
and
public
convenience
and
necessity.
following
this,
the
agency
receives
reports
from
the
other
agencies
on
the
factor
of
competition
but
not
the
factor
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
i
stress
this
because
there
is
a
tendency
to
feel
that
if
one
of
the
other
agencies
has
called
the
attention
to
what
it
conceives
to
be
serious
competitive
effects
of
this
merger
that
then
when
the
agency
charged
with
the
ultimate
determination
approves
the
merger
that
in
some
way
it
is
overruling
or
disregarding
reviews
of
the
other
agency,
this
is
not
necessarily
so.
the
first
agency
which
it
rendered
the
advisory
report
is
limited
only
to
competition
and
does
not
express
its
views
on
convenience
and
needs.
now,
the
next
step
as
far
as
the
banks
are
concerned
is
to
supplement
their
presentation
and
in
our
case
we
were
not
able
to
print
for
you
the
very
extensive
supplementary
material.
this
material
was
designed
to
answer
every
question
which
the
comptroller
had
raised
and
to
answer
every
question
which
the
federal
--
apparently,
the
federal
reserve
board
had
raised
in
its
advisory
opinion,
we
feel
that
it
did
that.
most
of
that
material
went
to
the
department
of
justice,
not
all
of
it
but
all
that
we
felt
the
department
would
be
interested
in.
concurrently
with
this,
there
is
an
investigation
which
a
--
is
a
private
investigation
by
the
banking
agencies.
mr.
metzger
has
indicated
to
you
the
general
nature
of
it.
the
--
i
believe
that
mr.
o'malley
will
be
arguing
for
the
comptroller
in
this
case
may
go
a
little
more
--
deeper
into
it.
i
found
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
committee
on
s.
1698
at
page
899
a
long
description
of
the
investigative
procedure
conducted
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
i
think
you
will
--
as
you
read
this
description,
you
will
feel
that
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
and
the
comptroller,
and
the
federal
reserve
board
make
a
thorough
effort
to
verify
the
factual
material
that
is
asserted
in
the
application
and
to
find
out
what
the
effect
of
the
merger
will
be
on
the
community
in
general.
now,
they
do
not
hold
a
hearing.
routinely,
they
do
not
hold
a
hearing.
they
can
hold
hearing,
but
they
usually
don't.
the
reason
why
they
don't
do
this
is
i
think
obvious,
if
you
start
to
think
about
the
kinds
of
issues
that
are
before
them.
a
bank
--
first
of
all,
a
bank
operates
in
a
fishbowl.
its
statistics,
all
the
facts
that
are
known
to
it
are
common
knowledge
to
the
examiners.
when
the
examiners
come
in
as
they
do
twice
a
year,
when
the
examiners
come
in
for
a
special
application
on
a
merger,
the
bank
tells
the
examiner
anything
he
wants
to
know.
so
the
facts
at
issue,
the
facts
in
an
application
are
rarely
at
issue
--
the
deposits
and
loans,
the
ratios,
where
the
bank
does
business,
all
these
kind
of
thing
are
known.
the
second
thing
about
a
bank
is
it's
a
creature
of
confidence.
it
maintains
its
business.
it
keeps
its
depositors,
it
keeps
its
customers,
only
so
long
as
they
have
complete
confidence
in
the
bank
that
they're
dealing
with.
now
many
of
the
factors
that
will
be
involved
in
any
agency,
in
any
merger,
are
factors
as
to
which
confidence
is
important.
of
course,
if
you
have
a
bank
that
is
failing
or
floundering,
the
last
thing
you
want
is
an
evidentiary
type
of
hearing
at
which
that
will
be
discussed.
but
it
goes
much
deeper
than
that.
if
a
bank
feels
that
the
merger
will
improve
the
quality
of
its
service,
it
is
extremely
difficult
in
an
evidentiary
type
hearing
to
explain
that
without
explaining
at
the
same
time
that
there
is
something
substandard
about
its
present
service.
this
may
boil
all
very
well
if
you
know
the
merger
is
going
through.
but
if
you
don't
know
the
merger
is
going
through,
this
may
just
be
the
thing
that
will
not
only
lose
confidence
for
the
bank,
but
make
the
service
deteriorate
further
because
the
man
and
the
bank
who
is
--
department
you
have
even
indirectly
run
down
may
very
well
not
be
there
the
next
day,
he
may
find
another
bank
that
appreciates
his
services
more.
so
there
is
excellent
reason
why
the
hearings
have
traditionally
been
dispensed
with
in
bank
cases.
now
then,
what
does
the
statute
do
about
this?
and
i'm
now
speaking
about
this
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
court
below
because
that
after
all
is
the
question
in
the
provident
case.
judge
clarie
had
all
these
problems
to
wrestle
with
and
he
wrestled
with
them
over
a
long
period
of
time,
and
he
came
out
with
a
interpretation
of
these
--
of
the
act
which
makes
very
good
sense.
judge
clarie
and
this
statute
say,
"since
there
was
no
hearing
below,
we
will
afford
a
hearing
in
the
district
court,
not
the
circuit
court
because
circuit
courts
normally
don't
take
testimony.
we
will
have
a
hearing
in
the
district
court.
and
that
hearing,
every
issue
that
has
come
up
in
the
course
of
the
application
can
be
reviewed
and
the
parties
are
free
to
put
in
any
in
--
any
testimony
they
want."
now,
when
we
trench
upon
the
confidential
areas,
i
assume
that
the
court
will
treat
that
in
camara
with
all
the
confidentiality
that
is
necessary.
now,
judge
clarie
goes
further
than
that.
he
says
that,
"at
the
hearing
the
court
will
find
the
facts.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
substantiate
--
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
in
this
case,
judge
clarie
ruled,
"the
court
will
find
the
facts
only
when
you
get
to
the
area
of
discretion,
whatever
it
may
be,
will
the
court
vow
to
the
comptroller's
expertise,
the
comptroller's
informed
judgment."
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
as
i
envision
this
procedure
your
honor,
the
issues
would
involve
as
mr.
turner
had
said,
essentially
factual
things,
to
take
a
rather
simple
one,
will
there
be
a
substant
--
with
substantial
economies
relating
to
this
merger.
now
these
--
the
existence
of
this
issue
is
identified
in
the
application
itself
and
it
is
further
elaborated
in
pretrial
proceedings
including
a
lengthy
pretrial
brief.
now,
the
parties
will
be
free
if
the
department
of
justice
wishes
to
challenge
that
factual
issue,
they
can
bring
in
all
the
testimony
they
want
and
prove
that
they
can,
that
there
will
be
no
incompetence.
another
issue
in
this
case
is
that
the
bank
served
different
portions
of
the
city
(voice
overlap).
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
there
will
be
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
well
i
think
in
this
situation,
we
would
be
about
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
where
justice
--
where
mr.
turner
was,
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
comptroller's
evidence
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
believe
that
would
be
right
sir.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
ultimate
question,
you
see
what
we
have,
we
have
here
an
ultimate
determination
by
the
comptroller
that
this
merger
weighing
all
these
factors,
some
pro,
some
con,
some
rather
speculative,
some
immediate.
he
has
--
you
have
an
ultimate
determination
that
that
is
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
he
decided
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
mr.
justice
fortas
what
i
think
he
did
is
this,
and
it's
very
easy
to
do.
i
think
he
took
the
pro-competitive,
the
pro-competitive
effect
of
the
merger
and
balanced
it
first
against
the
anticompetitive
effect
and
came
out
with
a
conclusion
that
the
overall
effect
on
competition
was
favorable.
then
he
added
a
few
more
points.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
think
what
he
is
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
that
was
in
the
other
case
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
in
this
case
your
honor,
it
is
of
course
true
that
he
did
not
follow
precisely
the
statutory
scheme
and
we
perhaps
all
could
wish
that
he
had.
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
he
identified
the
factors
which
in
his
view
made
this
merger
in
the
public
interest.
he
identified
a
pro-competitive
effect.
he
identified
efficiencies.
he
identified
improved
quality
of
service.
he
analyzed
the
anticompetitive
effects
which
have
been
pointed
out
to
him
in
which
are
--
which
would
be
there
under
a
--
under
the
complaint
in
this
case.
he
analyzed
that.
and
he
came
out
when
he
was
through
with
a
final
answer,
with
a
final
conclusion
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
and
that
we
would
be
hurting
the
economy
of
philadelphia
if
(voice

--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
your
honor
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
well,
your
honor
in
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
--
in
our
case
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
in
our
case,
as
you
know,
the
complaint
was
upheld
over
our
objection,
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
notice
of
pleading
and
that
we
knew
what
the
charge
against
us
was.
but
when
you
come
down
to
this
posture
of
the
case
as
it
is
presented
to
this
court,
there
is
no
question
about
these
things.by
this
time,
two
things
had
happened.
the
court
had
ordered
parties
to
set
forth
the
issues
and
the
facts
on
which
they
were
reminded.
and
so
in
this
case,
if
the
department
of
justice
had
any
issues
to
take,
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
refine
and
define
those
issues
so
that
when
it
went
before
the
court,
the
court
would
know
where
the
parties
were
in
dispute
as
to
either
what
the
facts
were
or
what
weight
should
be
assigned
to
it.
the
second
thing
that
had
happened
in
this
case
is
there
had
been
a
complete
discovery
and
the
department
had
asked
--
had
filed
lengthy
interrogatories
asking
--
going
down
through
the
application
itself
and
asking
what
is
the
ground
for
this
contention,
what
is
the
ground
for
that
contention,
what
is
the
ground
for
the
next
contention?
so
that
by
the
time
this
case
was
presented
to
judge
clarie,
there
had
been
ample
opportunity
to
get
at
the
precise
issues
that
i
think
about
are
new,
mr.
justice
fortas.
and
to
go
back
i
feel
that
under
judge
clarie's
ruling
here,
what
is
entitled
to
weight
is
the
comptroller's
ultimate
determination
based
on
this
mosaic
of
considerations
and
to
the
extent
that
the
department
would
be
successful
in
the
trial
in
taking
the
underpinning
out
from
under
that
determination.
they
might
show
that
they've
pulled
enough
from
the
box
out
from
underneath
it
that
he
was
wrong,
that
he
didn't
follow
the
statute's
plea
standard.
he
didn't
properly
understand
it
or
even
properly
follow
it.
but
to
the
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
don't
think
a
court
can
make
its
own
determination
of
public
need,
mr.
justice
black.i
really
don't
see
it
has
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
as
i
have
said
that
in
order
to
find
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
no,
sir
i
don't
believe
so,
i
mean
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
no
sir,
that's
--
my
point
is,
i
feel
that
if
--
i
--
you
misunderstood
me.
my
point
is
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
--
that
if
you
pull
the
props
up
from
under
the
comptroller's
determination
and
if
you
get
enough
props,
his
determination
would
fall
there.
i
think
that's
what
the
standard
of
review
is
here,
or
if
you
prove
that
he
acted
capriciously
arbitrarily.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
it
could
say
that
if
it
felt
that
that
was
a
part
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
they
could
say
that
the
basis
for
his
determination
had
been
so
destroyed
that
his
determination
was
outside
the
bound
for
his
discretion.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
think
the
--
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
i
don't
think
it
has
--
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
court
would
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
don't
follow
your
question.
the
--
in
my
hypothetical
case,
the
comptroller
has
purported
to
do
that.
in
fact
that's
what
he
has
done.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
situation
they
are
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
no
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
excuse
me
your
honor.
the
act
doesn't
say
that.
the
act
says
that
the
comptroller
may
not
approve
an
anticompetitive
merger.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
unless.
and
therefore
if
you
find
that
all
the
props
are
pulled
out
from
under
his
arguments
on
convenience
and
needs,
it
seems
to
me
that
then
he
may
not
approve
the
merger
--
the
merger
be
approved
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
he
is
wrong?
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
no
your
honor,
i
would
--
i
felt
that
before
you
pull
the
props
out,
you
give
the
banks
a
chance
to
be
heard.
that
is
i
think
the
--
and
i
--
this
is
what
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
this
is
what
judge
clarie
envisioned.
he
envisioned
that
the
department
of
justice
would
put
in
its
contentions
on
the
facts
and
then
the
banks
would
put
in
theirs,
and
the
comptroller
would
put
in
his
if
you
will
and
when
it
was
through,
the
court,
i
take
it
would
decide
whether
there
was
warrant
for
the
comptroller's
opinion
in
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court,
this
being
the
smithfield
apa
procedure.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i'm
not
sure
of
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
have
the
case
before
me.
the
case
before
me
i
have
judge
clarie's
ruling.
i
have
his
handling
of
the
hearing
matter.
now,
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
the
comptroller
stands.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
he
has
to
consider
all
cases
and
i
think
perhaps
he
takes
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
well,
your
honor,
in
our
case,
the
court
announced
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
it
was
going
to
make
a
redetermination
of
the
facts.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
sir,
we
didn't
get
to
the
evidence
point.
the
court
announced
that
that
was
the
kind
of
a
hearing
it
was
going
to
--
to
hold.
then
it
asked
the
parties
to
submit
the
outlines
of
the
testimony
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
and
when
the
department
of
justice
submitted
its
outline
of
testimony,
it
stated
that
it
was
not
going
to
submit
any
testimony
as
to
the
existence
or
the
significance
of
factors
of
convenience
and
need.
and
at
this
point,
the
banks
moved
for
a
final
judgment,
the
nature
of
a
judgment
that
you
would
make
after
the
plaintiff
has
finished
his
case
and
when
he
has
not
met
the
burden
of
proof
assigned
to
him
and
the
judge
made
--
entered
a
final
judgment
in
our
favor
on
that
basis.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
now,
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
take
one
minute
more
to
answer
one
other
question
that
came
up
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
with
mr.
turner.
i
wish
that
--
i
wish
i
had
more
time
to
go
into
the
question
of
what
the
nature
of
this
public
policy
determination,
but
it
is
covered
in
our
brief.
perhaps,
this
one
question
will
illustrate
it
as
well
as
anything
else.
they
had
a
discussion
here
about
merger
(inaudible).
and
there
was
a
discussion
about
--
well,
if
the
loan
isn't
available
in
this
city
then
it
will
be
available
in
that
city,
and
if
it
isn't
available
for
one
bank,
it
will
be
available
for
several
banks.
now,
this
may
be
probably
is
the
standard
antitrust
analysis
of
a
market
situation.
perhaps
it's
even
an
economic
analysis
if
it
not
be
a
banking
analysis.
to
a
bank,
there
are
--
there
is
--
there
are
two
forms
of
large
amount.
one
is,
when
you
are
just
the
participant,
when
you
just
have
a
share
of
the
amount
and
this
is
nice
but
it
isn't,
it
doesn't
--
it
does
not
improve
the
quality
of
service
of
the
bank
very
much.
the
other
position
is
the
lead
position.
in
the
lead
position,
you
are
the
man
--
if
your
people
who
work
at
the
time
(inaudible),
to
work
with
the
borrower,
to
decide
what
is
the
most
appropriate
form
of
loan
to
have,
and
whether
they
--
whether
the
financing
should
be
in
one
piece,
all
the
intricacies
that
are
becoming
more
and
more
apparent
in
bank
lending.
now,
it's
the
biggest
bank,
that
is
the
lending
--
the
leading
bank
in
almost
every
case.
we
have
cases
in
our
--
in
our
submission
here
for
the
situation
where
a
bank
starts
out
as
a
lead
bank
and
its
men
are
getting
this
kind
of
training
and
expertise.
and
then
other
banks
are
brought
in
because
our
bank
can
no
longer
satisfy
the
customer's
demands
and
then
bigger
banks
are
brought
in.
and
finally,
they
get
a
bigger
share.
and
then,
what
happens?
our
bank
is
no
longer
the
lead
bank.
now
this
is
bad
not
only
for
our
bank
but
for
our
community
because
the
reputation
of
our
bank
as
a
leading
bank,
a
bank
with
skilled
personnel,
expert
in
these
situations,
is
what
brings
business
to
our
community.
more
than
that,
that
same
expertise
that
they
developed
in
these
big
situations
are
used
in
their
smaller
amounts,
so
that
when
we
get
edged
out
of
the
lead
position,
the
quality
of
our
service,
the
expertise
of
our
people,
our
prestige,
and
our
ability
to
serve
our
smaller
customers
all
suffer.
now
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
comptroller
knows,
the
federal
reserve
board
knows
instinctively,
this
is
the
warp
and
woof
of
banking.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
district
court
knows,
and
with
all
due
deference
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
department
of
justice
seems
to
pay
its
attention.
and
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
think
the
congress
had
in
mind,
when
it
said
that
a
merger
should
be
judged
on
the
public
interest,
as
the
interest
of
the
total
community,
weighing
any
anticompetitive
needs
--
effects
against
--
the
beneficial
effects
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community.
thank
you.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
think
the
main
purpose
of
this
bill
justice
black
was
to
restore
the
public
interest,
the
test
of
public
interest
to
these
situations
as
a
result
of
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
the
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
i
think
there
was
a
very
important
point
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
your
honor
it
is
an
extremely
important
point.
the
only
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard
yes
sir.
and
i
think
one
of
the
other
purposes
as
stated
by
senator
robertson,
when
he
first
--
put
the
first
bill
and
it's
to
restore
the
(inaudible)
of
public
interest.
and
that
i
think
is
the
reason
why
the
court
below
is
correct
when
it
said
that
the
view
taken
here
by
the
department
of
justice
which
just
ignores
the
expertise
of
the
federal
banking
agencies,
just
ignores
them,
treats
them
the
way
we
treat
magistrate
courts
in
philadelphia.
that
i
think
--
it
was
--
it's
--
the
court
is
correct
in
holding
that
that
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
difference
usually
given,
let's
say,
the
federal
reserve
board
and
we
don't
have
any
question
about
people
in
this
particular
case,
it's
just
not
in
accordance
with
the
deference
given
to
them
and
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
normal
function
of
a
district
court
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
