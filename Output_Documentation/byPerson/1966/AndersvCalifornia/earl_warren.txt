chief

is
there
any

you

mr.

chief

was
any
case
ever
come
within
your
experience
where
privately
retained
lawyer
ever
came
to
the
court
and
said,
“my
client
has
no
case
and
i
therefore
won't
file
a
brief
for
it”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
the
man
who's
appointed
to
--
doesn't
the
man
who's
appointed
to
represent
an
indigent
have
the
same
responsibility
to
his
client?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
it
would
seem
--
wouldn't
it
seem
a
little
strange
that
if
10%
of
the
lawyers
who
were
appointed
to
represent
indigents
should
come
in
and
say,
“my
client
has
no
case
and
i
don't
want
to
file
a
brief
or
pursue
it
further”.
whereon
the
other
hand,
no
man
who
is
privately
retained
ever
comes
in
and
make
such
a
statement.
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
difficult?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
just
wondering
you
said
awhile
ago
that
it
was
the
usual
thing
for
a
young
lawyer
who
had
never
had
an
appeal
to
take
these
indigent
cases.
don't
you
think
that
there
is
very
likely
to
be
an
injury
done
to
some
clients
where
you
have
--
we
have
lawyers
that
inexperienced
and
then
have
him
come
to
the
court
and
say,
“i
don't
find
anything
in
the
case”
or
“i
won't
write
a
brief”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
“i
won't
present
the
points
that
he
wants
to
(voice
overlap)”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
case
to
you.
we've
had
a
number
of
cases
in
this
court
where
it
is
alleged
that
there
has
been
systematic
exclusion
of
chores
in
the
negro
cases.
and
we've
had
the
representation
made
and
some
instances
it
hasn't
been
denied
that
no
lawyer
in
the
community
would
raise
--
no
white
lawyer
in
the
community
would
raise
that
question.
now,
suppose
the
lawyer
in
those
cases
does
as
you
do
in
california,
says,
“i've
examined
the
record.
i
find
no
error”.
and
the
case
comes
to
us
and
the
question
is
never
raised
and
so
forth.
what
would
you
think
our
duty
would
be
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
should
we
have
to
let
a
man
remain
in
jail
for
a
couple
of
years
before
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
comes
to
us
on
habeas
corpus,
and
if
perhaps
he
wasn't
guilty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
has
to
wait
in
some
states
for
a
couple
of
years
to
have
his
appeal
determined.
he
can't
go
to
--
to
go
on
a
habeas
corpus
until
his
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
appeal
is
determined.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
has
to
exhaust
his
remedies.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
--
i've
been
rather
proud
of
the
procedure
in
california
too
myself
for
many
years
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
there
isn't
a
great
gap
there
insofar
as
these
lawyers
who
come
in
and
some
of
them
vary
in
experience
who
say,
“i
find
nothing
in
the
case
and
i
won't
do
anything
for
this
man”.
now
should
there
be
some
way
this
man
can
have
something
done
for
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
rather
than
an
investigation
of
that
kind
by
a
judge
and
his
law
clerk
is
not
the
adversary
proceeding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
so
to
that
extent,
isn't
he
deprived
of
the
adversary
preceding
that
he
--
that
other
people
are
entitled
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
can't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
can't
make
a
record
himself,
what--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
follows
in
the
penitentiary
and
has
no
lawyer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
is
this.
when
the
lawyer
abdicates
and
says,
“i
won't
do
any
more
for
this
man.
i
see
nothing
in
his
case”.
the
adversary
proceeding
stops
right
there
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
that's
equal
justice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
if
there's
nothing
there,
i
agree
with
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
adversary
proceeding
is
supposed
to
bring
out
whether
there
is
anything
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
we
know
though
that
he
is
conscientious
in
doing
that
in
this
case,
he
didn't
even
make
the
motion
for
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
this
man
hasn't
had
the
benefit
of
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
supposing
this
man
had
been
the
trial
lawyer
and
hadn't
made
a
motion
for
new
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
this
man
can't
appeal
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
man
can't
appeal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
he
doesn't
get
any
hearing.
he
doesn't
get
any
hearing
before
the
court
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
true,
but
isn't
that
--
wasn't
that

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice

warren

chief

he
got

on
--
chief

on
a
thing
of
that
kind.
now,
but
--
didn't
some
lawyer
who's
never
had
any
experience
and
he
just
said,
“i
have
no
--
my
client
has
no
case
so
i

that

wouldn't
be
