mr.
ira
michael
heyman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
from
that
court's
denial
of
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
the
case
involves
whether
petitioner,
an
indigent,
was
provided
appointed
counsel
on
his
direct
appeal
from
a
criminal
conviction
consistently
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
especially
as
stated
in
douglas
versus
california.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
possession
of
marijuana
in
1957
after
a
jury
trial
at
which
he
had
been
represented
by
the
public
defender.
he
sought
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
in
the
california
courts.
a
transcript
--
a
full
transcript
was
provided
and
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
him.
counsel,
however,
informed
the
appellate
court
that
he,
the
counsel
would
not
file
a
brief,
because
in
his
opinion,
there
was
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
petitioner
then
requested
the
appointment
of
another
attorney.
this
request
was
denied
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
california
and
petitioner
was
advised
that
he
could
file
a
brief
pro
se
or
allow
the
district
court
of
appeal
to
decide
the
appeal
on
the
record.
petitioner
filed
a
pro
se
brief,
the
state
filed
a
lengthy
answering
brief,
petitioner
filed
a
pro
se
response.
and
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
affirmed
the
conviction.
this
occurred
in
1959.
in
january
of
1965
after
this
court's
decision
in
douglas
versus
california,
petitioner
sought
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
to
reinstate
his
original
appeal.
the
district
court
of
appeal
denied
his
petition.
petitioner
relied
in
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
on
douglas
versus
california
alleging
that
he
had
been
denied
a
federal
right
to
representation
by
counsel
on
his
direct
appeal
from
the
original
conviction.
the
order
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
denying
the
reinstatement
of
the
appeal
was
on
the
merits
for
it
cited
a
california
case
in
re
nash,
a
post-douglas
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
as
the
basis
for
the
denial
of
the
writ.
the
in
re
nash
case
indicates
that
the
procedure
originally
applied
in
this
case
meets
in
the
view
of
the
california
supreme
court
the
requirements
of
the
douglas
case.
petitioner
then
sought
habeas
corpus
on
the
same
grounds
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
in
california,
there
is
no
direct
appeal
from
the
denial
of
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
rather
the
petitioner
seeks
the
same
writ
in
the
higher
court.
the
supreme
court
of
california
denied
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
without
opinion.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
california
procedure
concerning
counsel
on
appeal
that
was
followed
in
this
case
adequately
meets
the
requirements
of
douglas.
under
that
procedure
which
is
in
issue
here,
one
that
was
approved,
as
i
had
stated
in
the
case
of
in
re
nash.
the
district
court
of
appeal
on
the
first
appeal
as
of
right
in
a
criminal
conviction
concerning
an
indigent
proceeds
to
consider
the
case
on
the
record
and
without
lawyer
prepared
briefs
for
the
defendant
and
without
oral
argument
if
appointed
counsel
files
a
so-called
no
merit
letter
with
the
appellate
court.
there
is
no
procedure
testing
the
adequacy
of
the
counsel's
determination
that
there
is
no
merit
in
the
sense
that
the
case
ought
not
to
be
argued
by
a
lawyer
in
behalf
of
the
indigent.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir?
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
no
sir,
the
district
court
of
appeals
has
a
full
record
of
the
case.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
made
automatically
in
california.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
right
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
right
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
all
it
has
before
it
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
sir.
it
has
somewhat
the
same
thing
it
had
under
the
procedure
prior
to
douglas
versus
california
when
it
had
a
record
and
it
had
to
make
a
determination
whether
to
appoint
counsel,
in
other
words
would
counsel
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir,
a
very
full
record.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir,
i
want
to
be
sure
that
the
court
understand
this
is
a
very
full
record.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
right
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes.
in
the
situation
where
the
no-merit
letter
is
filed
the
court
then
goes
straight
to
the
merits
in
the
same
manner
that
it
did
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir
that's
precisely
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
it's
not
dissimilar
in
my
view
in
any
event
to
the
procedure
that
existed
prior
to
douglas
versus
california
which
this
court
rejected
in
the
douglas
versus
california
case.
in
douglas,
the
court
rejected
a
california
procedure
under
which
the
appellate
court
unaided
by
counsel,
reviewed
the
trial
record
and
the
full
record
indicated
before,
to
determine
whether
counsel
should
be
appointed.
two
interrelated
reasons
in
my
view
supported
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
douglas
case.
the
first
is
the
necessity
of
a
lawyer
participating
in
the
adversary
process,
the
essence
of
which
is
really
challenged.
and
where
both
that
trial
and
on
appeal,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
more
trained
person
fully
to
exploit
the
potentialities
and
the
system
of
the
adversary
process.
a
fair
trial
or
a
fair
appeal
requires
counsel
to
deal
with
the
complexities
of
fact
and
law
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
it's
hard
for
me
to
generalize
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
this
case,
what
the
court
did
was
then
to
notify
petitioner
that
he
could
file
a
pro
se
brief
or
not
as
he
wished,
and
that
it,
the
appellate
court
on
the
record
would
determine
whether
to
affirm
or
to
reverse
the
conviction.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
in
this
case
he
did
file
a
pro
se
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
no
oral
argument.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
generally
oral
argument.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i'm
quite
sure
there
is
not
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
it
did
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
no,
it
mentioned
in
that
opinion
your
honor
that
petitioner's
attorney
had
withdrawn
indicating
that
in
his
view
there
was
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
it
then
took
the
contentions
that
petitioner
made
and
that
the
state
responded
to
--
in
its
answering
brief,
it
considered
each
of
those
and
it
found
no
merit
if
you
will,
or
at
least
it
rejected
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner,
didn't
indicate
that
it'd
received
help
from
elsewhere.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
no.
i
--
in
the
appendix
b
to
my
brief,
i
have
an
excerpt
from
a
book
that
was
just
published
or
published
recently
by
the
american
bar
foundation
concerning
the
law
of
the
poor,
and
interestingly
enough,
the
section
on
california
includes
a
description
of
appellate
procedure
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
on
which
this
case
arose.
and
the
person
who
is
describing
that
procedure
indicates
that
when
a
counsel
files
a
no-merit
letter
as
in
this
case,
a
judge
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
is
assigned
to
the
case
and
he
and
his
research
attorney,
which
i
suspect
means
law
clerk,
make
an
estimate
of
the
record
in
the
case
to
determine
whether
there
is
merit
to
the
appeal,
or
to
deal
with
the
appeal.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i
can
not
--
i
just
don't
recall
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
suspect
the
court
probably
did
say
that
but
i'd
have
to
reread
its
opinion.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
if
he
had
made
a
similar
report?
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
well,
my
--
in
my
view
your
honor
is
that
the
system
should
be
so
constructed
that
the
lawyer
should
come
forward
with
the
best
argument
that
he
can
make
under
the
circumstances.
and
there
are
very
few
instances,
at
least
i've
seen
in
my
relatively
short
career
where
some
points
can
not
be
argued
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
the
representation
of
a
client.
my
worry
with
the
california
procedure
that's
under
consideration
here
is
that
it
makes
it
too
easy
for
appointed
attorneys
to
withdraw
from
cases
thus
leading
to
appellate
consideration
without
lawyer
representation.
and
that
if
the
law
was
such
that
indigents,
if
they
so
desire,
had
to
be
represented
by
counsel
then
the
bar
which
in
many
instances
fills
the
appointed
positions
clearly
would
know
its
duty
and
clearly
would
go
forward
and
make
the
best
possible
case
for
the
indigent
client.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that's
one
of
the
problems
that
i
find
with
the
california
procedure
that
at
no
time
does
a
court
address
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
substance
of
the
case
is
such
that
an
attorney
ought
to
be
appointed
to
represent
the
indigent,
rather
the
court
will
go
straight
to
the
merits
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed
or
reversed.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
what
i
believe
mr.
justice
white.
it's
awfully
difficult
to
tell
because
the
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
well
that's
correct.
of
course
it
gets
somewhat
tautological
here,
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
we
could
recognize.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
well
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'm
pleased
that
they
go
--
and
i
expect
they
do,
that
the
california
courts
go
further
than
the
specific
intentions
that
or
at
least
desire
to
go
further
than
the
specific
contentions
raised
by
petitioner.
i'm
sure
that
often
happens
as
a
matter
of
fact.
my
argument
is
that
that's
not
enough
and
that
what
the
indigent
--
what
to
get
under
the
standard
of
the
douglas
case
is
an
attorney
who
will
represent
him
and
not
an
attorney
who
files
a
no-merit
letter.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
there
are
three
alternatives
--
well,
i
think
i'd
prefer
to
just
compare
very
briefly
the
procedures
in
douglas
and
the
procedures
here.
as
i'd
indicated
before,
two
interrelated
reasons
underlay
douglas,
one,
the
adversary
system
point
and
the
other,
the
discrimination
point
between
indigents
and
non-indigents.
in
my
view,
the
infirmities
and
the
procedure
that
were
reject
--
procedures
rejected
in
the
douglas
case
are
not
cured
under
the
procedure
here
where
counsel
is
appointed
but
can
withdraw
with
ease
resulting
again
in
appellate
court
consideration
without
benefit
of
briefs
and
argument.
first
of
all,
only
one
side
is
represented
on
the
appeal
and
that's
the
point
to
which
i've
been
giving
most
of
my
attention
so
far.
and
in
that
situation,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
one
side
the
state
being
represented
on
the
appeal,
the
indigent
is
not
only
not
represented
but
he's
in
a
situation
in
which
he
has
his
attorney
rather,
his
appointed
attorney
has
made
a
statement
that
there
is
no
merit
to
his
case.
in
my
view,
the
discrimination
problem
in
the
douglas
case
is
not
very
ameliorated
by
the
procedure
in
this
case.
in
fact,
in
my
view
it's
potentially
worse
because
under
the
pre-douglas
procedure
the
court,
district
court
of
appeal,
screened
the
cases
to
determine
whether
counsel
was
appropriate.
under
this
procedure
presently
existent
in
california,
counsel
who
might
have
a
number
of
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
brief
and
argue,
or
at
least
for
seeing
himself
in
the
position
of
amicus
rather
than
advocate.
in
a
real
sense,
does
the
screening,
he
makes
the
determination
whether
or
not
the
defendant
shall
be
represented
on
the
appeal.
and
so,
in
my
view,
the
upshot
is
that
the
procedure
like
that
in
douglas
lends
itself
to
producing
appeals
which
involve
non-frivolous
issues
in
which
the
indigent
in
fact
is
not
represented
and
this
against
his
will.
your
honor,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
well,
i
guess
just
one
thing
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i
think
that
respondent
brings
up
a
point
with
some
validity,
your
honor,
that
what
is
the
lawyer
to
do?
i'd
like
to
put
it
this
way.
i
think
there
will
be
instances
if
the
court,
this
court
requires
that
indigents
who
desire
be
represented
by
counsel
in
a
meaningful
way
on
appeal.
there
will
be
instances
in
which
a
counsel
is
very
hard
put
to
make
an
argument.
but
i
would
submit
this
that
there
will
be
many
more
instances
where
counsel
will
make
arguments
which
are
meritorious
in
the
sense
that
they
certainly
bear
consideration
by
the
appellate
court.
where
those
arguments
would
not
be
made
under
the
present
california
system,
and
balancing
those
two
off,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
proceed
by
assuring
counsel
rather
than
the
contrary.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
from
that
court's
denial
of
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
the
case
involves
whether
petitioner,
an
indigent,
was
provided
appointed
counsel
on
his
direct
appeal
from
a
criminal
conviction
consistently
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
especially
as
stated
in
douglas
versus
california.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
possession
of
marijuana
in
1957
after
a
jury
trial
at
which
he
had
been
represented
by
the
public
defender.
he
sought
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
in
the
california
courts.
a
transcript
--
a
full
transcript
was
provided
and
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
him.
counsel,
however,
informed
the
appellate
court
that
he,
the
counsel
would
not
file
a
brief,
because
in
his
opinion,
there
was
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
petitioner
then
requested
the
appointment
of
another
attorney.
this
request
was
denied
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
california
and
petitioner
was
advised
that
he
could
file
a
brief
pro
se
or
allow
the
district
court
of
appeal
to
decide
the
appeal
on
the
record.
petitioner
filed
a
pro
se
brief,
the
state
filed
a
lengthy
answering
brief,
petitioner
filed
a
pro
se
response.
and
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
affirmed
the
conviction.
this
occurred
in
1959.
in
january
of
1965
after
this
court's
decision
in
douglas
versus
california,
petitioner
sought
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
to
reinstate
his
original
appeal.
the
district
court
of
appeal
denied
his
petition.
petitioner
relied
in
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
on
douglas
versus
california
alleging
that
he
had
been
denied
a
federal
right
to
representation
by
counsel
on
his
direct
appeal
from
the
original
conviction.
the
order
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
denying
the
reinstatement
of
the
appeal
was
on
the
merits
for
it
cited
a
california
case
in
re
nash,
a
post-douglas
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
as
the
basis
for
the
denial
of
the
writ.
the
in
re
nash
case
indicates
that
the
procedure
originally
applied
in
this
case
meets
in
the
view
of
the
california
supreme
court
the
requirements
of
the
douglas
case.
petitioner
then
sought
habeas
corpus
on
the
same
grounds
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
in
california,
there
is
no
direct
appeal
from
the
denial
of
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
rather
the
petitioner
seeks
the
same
writ
in
the
higher
court.
the
supreme
court
of
california
denied
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
without
opinion.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
california
procedure
concerning
counsel
on
appeal
that
was
followed
in
this
case
adequately
meets
the
requirements
of
douglas.
under
that
procedure
which
is
in
issue
here,
one
that
was
approved,
as
i
had
stated
in
the
case
of
in
re
nash.
the
district
court
of
appeal
on
the
first
appeal
as
of
right
in
a
criminal
conviction
concerning
an
indigent
proceeds
to
consider
the
case
on
the
record
and
without
lawyer
prepared
briefs
for
the
defendant
and
without
oral
argument
if
appointed
counsel
files
a
so-called
no
merit
letter
with
the
appellate
court.
there
is
no
procedure
testing
the
adequacy
of
the
counsel's
determination
that
there
is
no
merit
in
the
sense
that
the
case
ought
not
to
be
argued
by
a
lawyer
in
behalf
of
the
indigent.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir?
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
no
sir,
the
district
court
of
appeals
has
a
full
record
of
the
case.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
made
automatically
in
california.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
right
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
right
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
all
it
has
before
it
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
sir.
it
has
somewhat
the
same
thing
it
had
under
the
procedure
prior
to
douglas
versus
california
when
it
had
a
record
and
it
had
to
make
a
determination
whether
to
appoint
counsel,
in
other
words
would
counsel
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir,
a
very
full
record.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir,
i
want
to
be
sure
that
the
court
understand
this
is
a
very
full
record.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
right
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes.
in
the
situation
where
the
no-merit
letter
is
filed
the
court
then
goes
straight
to
the
merits
in
the
same
manner
that
it
did
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir
that's
precisely
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
it's
not
dissimilar
in
my
view
in
any
event
to
the
procedure
that
existed
prior
to
douglas
versus
california
which
this
court
rejected
in
the
douglas
versus
california
case.
in
douglas,
the
court
rejected
a
california
procedure
under
which
the
appellate
court
unaided
by
counsel,
reviewed
the
trial
record
and
the
full
record
indicated
before,
to
determine
whether
counsel
should
be
appointed.
two
interrelated
reasons
in
my
view
supported
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
douglas
case.
the
first
is
the
necessity
of
a
lawyer
participating
in
the
adversary
process,
the
essence
of
which
is
really
challenged.
and
where
both
that
trial
and
on
appeal,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
more
trained
person
fully
to
exploit
the
potentialities
and
the
system
of
the
adversary
process.
a
fair
trial
or
a
fair
appeal
requires
counsel
to
deal
with
the
complexities
of
fact
and
law
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
it's
hard
for
me
to
generalize
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
this
case,
what
the
court
did
was
then
to
notify
petitioner
that
he
could
file
a
pro
se
brief
or
not
as
he
wished,
and
that
it,
the
appellate
court
on
the
record
would
determine
whether
to
affirm
or
to
reverse
the
conviction.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
in
this
case
he
did
file
a
pro
se
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
no
oral
argument.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
generally
oral
argument.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i'm
quite
sure
there
is
not
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
it
did
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
no,
it
mentioned
in
that
opinion
your
honor
that
petitioner's
attorney
had
withdrawn
indicating
that
in
his
view
there
was
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
it
then
took
the
contentions
that
petitioner
made
and
that
the
state
responded
to
--
in
its
answering
brief,
it
considered
each
of
those
and
it
found
no
merit
if
you
will,
or
at
least
it
rejected
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner,
didn't
indicate
that
it'd
received
help
from
elsewhere.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
no.
i
--
in
the
appendix
b
to
my
brief,
i
have
an
excerpt
from
a
book
that
was
just
published
or
published
recently
by
the
american
bar
foundation
concerning
the
law
of
the
poor,
and
interestingly
enough,
the
section
on
california
includes
a
description
of
appellate
procedure
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
on
which
this
case
arose.
and
the
person
who
is
describing
that
procedure
indicates
that
when
a
counsel
files
a
no-merit
letter
as
in
this
case,
a
judge
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
is
assigned
to
the
case
and
he
and
his
research
attorney,
which
i
suspect
means
law
clerk,
make
an
estimate
of
the
record
in
the
case
to
determine
whether
there
is
merit
to
the
appeal,
or
to
deal
with
the
appeal.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i
can
not
--
i
just
don't
recall
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
suspect
the
court
probably
did
say
that
but
i'd
have
to
reread
its
opinion.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
if
he
had
made
a
similar
report?
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
well,
my
--
in
my
view
your
honor
is
that
the
system
should
be
so
constructed
that
the
lawyer
should
come
forward
with
the
best
argument
that
he
can
make
under
the
circumstances.
and
there
are
very
few
instances,
at
least
i've
seen
in
my
relatively
short
career
where
some
points
can
not
be
argued
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
the
representation
of
a
client.
my
worry
with
the
california
procedure
that's
under
consideration
here
is
that
it
makes
it
too
easy
for
appointed
attorneys
to
withdraw
from
cases
thus
leading
to
appellate
consideration
without
lawyer
representation.
and
that
if
the
law
was
such
that
indigents,
if
they
so
desire,
had
to
be
represented
by
counsel
then
the
bar
which
in
many
instances
fills
the
appointed
positions
clearly
would
know
its
duty
and
clearly
would
go
forward
and
make
the
best
possible
case
for
the
indigent
client.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that's
one
of
the
problems
that
i
find
with
the
california
procedure
that
at
no
time
does
a
court
address
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
substance
of
the
case
is
such
that
an
attorney
ought
to
be
appointed
to
represent
the
indigent,
rather
the
court
will
go
straight
to
the
merits
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed
or
reversed.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that's
what
i
believe
mr.
justice
white.
it's
awfully
difficult
to
tell
because
the
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
that
is
correct.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
well
that's
correct.
of
course
it
gets
somewhat
tautological
here,
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
we
could
recognize.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
well
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'm
pleased
that
they
go
--
and
i
expect
they
do,
that
the
california
courts
go
further
than
the
specific
intentions
that
or
at
least
desire
to
go
further
than
the
specific
contentions
raised
by
petitioner.
i'm
sure
that
often
happens
as
a
matter
of
fact.
my
argument
is
that
that's
not
enough
and
that
what
the
indigent
--
what
to
get
under
the
standard
of
the
douglas
case
is
an
attorney
who
will
represent
him
and
not
an
attorney
who
files
a
no-merit
letter.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
there
are
three
alternatives
--
well,
i
think
i'd
prefer
to
just
compare
very
briefly
the
procedures
in
douglas
and
the
procedures
here.
as
i'd
indicated
before,
two
interrelated
reasons
underlay
douglas,
one,
the
adversary
system
point
and
the
other,
the
discrimination
point
between
indigents
and
non-indigents.
in
my
view,
the
infirmities
and
the
procedure
that
were
reject
--
procedures
rejected
in
the
douglas
case
are
not
cured
under
the
procedure
here
where
counsel
is
appointed
but
can
withdraw
with
ease
resulting
again
in
appellate
court
consideration
without
benefit
of
briefs
and
argument.
first
of
all,
only
one
side
is
represented
on
the
appeal
and
that's
the
point
to
which
i've
been
giving
most
of
my
attention
so
far.
and
in
that
situation,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
one
side
the
state
being
represented
on
the
appeal,
the
indigent
is
not
only
not
represented
but
he's
in
a
situation
in
which
he
has
his
attorney
rather,
his
appointed
attorney
has
made
a
statement
that
there
is
no
merit
to
his
case.
in
my
view,
the
discrimination
problem
in
the
douglas
case
is
not
very
ameliorated
by
the
procedure
in
this
case.
in
fact,
in
my
view
it's
potentially
worse
because
under
the
pre-douglas
procedure
the
court,
district
court
of
appeal,
screened
the
cases
to
determine
whether
counsel
was
appropriate.
under
this
procedure
presently
existent
in
california,
counsel
who
might
have
a
number
of
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
brief
and
argue,
or
at
least
for
seeing
himself
in
the
position
of
amicus
rather
than
advocate.
in
a
real
sense,
does
the
screening,
he
makes
the
determination
whether
or
not
the
defendant
shall
be
represented
on
the
appeal.
and
so,
in
my
view,
the
upshot
is
that
the
procedure
like
that
in
douglas
lends
itself
to
producing
appeals
which
involve
non-frivolous
issues
in
which
the
indigent
in
fact
is
not
represented
and
this
against
his
will.
your
honor,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
well,
i
guess
just
one
thing
your
honor.
mr.
ira
michael
heyman
i
think
that
respondent
brings
up
a
point
with
some
validity,
your
honor,
that
what
is
the
lawyer
to
do?
i'd
like
to
put
it
this
way.
i
think
there
will
be
instances
if
the
court,
this
court
requires
that
indigents
who
desire
be
represented
by
counsel
in
a
meaningful
way
on
appeal.
there
will
be
instances
in
which
a
counsel
is
very
hard
put
to
make
an
argument.
but
i
would
submit
this
that
there
will
be
many
more
instances
where
counsel
will
make
arguments
which
are
meritorious
in
the
sense
that
they
certainly
bear
consideration
by
the
appellate
court.
where
those
arguments
would
not
be
made
under
the
present
california
system,
and
balancing
those
two
off,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
proceed
by
assuring
counsel
rather
than
the
contrary.
thank
you
your
honor.
