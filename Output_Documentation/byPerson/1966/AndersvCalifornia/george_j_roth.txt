mr.
george
j.
roth
honorable
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
start
with
an
explanation
of
the
appellate
system
in
california
because
i
believe
there's
a
little
misconception
perhaps,
and
i'm
sure
it's
unintentional
with
actually
what
happens
as
a
practical
matter.
first
of
all,
traditionally
in
our
state,
the
attorney's
obligation
to
the
client
ends
at
the
trial
level
stage
after
the
judgment
is
entered,
after
the
man
in
this
case,
was
sent
to
prison.he
was
represented
by
the
public
defender
of
the
county
of
merced.
traditionally,
this
is
true
with
paid
clients
as
well
as
indigent
clients.
then,
after
the
judgment
is
entered
under
our
statute,
rather
under
our
rules
i
should
of
court
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
there
are
motions
for
new
trial
your
honor,
they
are
made
--
they're
not
required
for
the
appeal.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
appeal
except
in
one
case
where
a
man
is
committed
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
trial
counsel
makes
the
motion
for
new
trial
your
honor.
if
and
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
oh,
yes
your
honor,
many
times.
what
happens
is
we
find,
in
looking
at
records
in
paid
counsel
cases
as
well
as
appointed
counsel
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
question
your
honor,
they
get
a
full
record,
they
get
a
transcript
of
all
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that
was
true
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
motion
for
new
trial
on
my
knowledge
your
honor.
now,
many
times
--
to
follow
up
on
your
honor's
question,
we
find
with
paid
counsel
as
well
as
with
appellate
counsel,
they
will
say
to
the
court,
“i
would
like
to
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
all
of
the
statutory
grounds”,
and
they
offer
no
other
points.
this
did
not
happen
here
to
my
recollection
your
honor.
what
happens
after
the
judgment
is
entered
and
the
obligation
of
the
trial
lawyer
has
ended.
the
man
himself
in
the
old
days
used
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
which
could
be
in
a
very
simple
form
or
letter
to
the
trial
court
and
the
notice
of
appeal
goes
to
the
trial
court.
today,
under
recent
cases,
there's
probably
a
further
obligation
on
trial
counsel
to
see
that
his
man
gets
a
notice
of
appeal
filed
if
he
wants
one.
that
automatically
starts
the
procedure
whereby
the
clerk's
minutes
are
transcribed
and
the
complete
report
as
transcript
is
made.
that
under
today's
procedure
a
normal
record
even
includes
instructions
given
and
received.
there
is
an
extra
normal
record
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
it's
been
changed
to
add
normal
record
without
even
requesting
it
to
include
instructions
your
honor.
in
the
old
days,
when
this
case
was
before
the
bar,
the
procedure
was
and
it's
still
is
with
everything
except
instructions
that
the
appellant
or
his
attorney
later
on,
when
he's
appointed
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
that,
can
request
extension
of
the
normal
record.
most
of
the
time,
it
seems
that
the
court's
grant
it.
in
this
case,
i
think
the
court
concede
the
man
got
almost
everything
that
they
had.
and
so,
then
what
happens
is
the
mechanical
process
of
transcribing
the
record
goes
along.
when
it's
finally
completed
three
copies
are
made
by
the
rules
and
this
is
whether
the
man
is
poor
or
rich,
everybody
gets
the
same
treatment.
there's
no
charge
for
it.
no
charge
to
appeal.
the
--
one
copy
of
the
record
goes
to
the
court,
one
copy
goes
to
the
appellant
if
--
or
his
attorney
if
he
has
an
attorney,
and
one
copy
goes
to
the
attorney
general.
then
after
that,
when
the
record
gets
to
the
appellate
court,
they
immediately
are
aware
that
there
is
no
counsel
in
an
indigent
case.
the
general
practice
with
most
of
the
district
courts
of
appeal,
there
are
presently
five
courts
of
appeal
composed
of
13
panels
of
three
judges
altogether.
and
the
general
practice
in
most
of
the
districts
at
the
present
time,
and
it
goes
back
some
years,
i
can't
say
exactly
when,
is
for
the
clerk
to
notify
the
appellant
that
the
appeal
is
before
the
court.
that
he
has
received
his
transcript.
they
notice
he
has
no
attorney,
and
they
ask
him,
“would
you
like
an
attorney
appointed?
you
are
entitled
to
one
if
you
cannot
afford
it”.
they
usually
send
some
type
of
a
pauperis
statement
that'd
be
filled
out
under
penalty
of
perjury,
and
it
comes
back
like
an
affidavit.
then
if
the
man
says
he
wants
counsel
and
he's
an
indigent,
to
my
recollection,
i
think
there's
only
one
case
i
know
of
in
the
last
four
or
five
years
where
they
even
doubted
the
man's
statement.
i
happen
to
be
in
court
at
the
time
accidentally
where
i
saw
the
court's
questioning
the
man
orally.
he
was
out
on
bail
and
they
wondered
about
it.
but
otherwise,
to
my
knowledge
any
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor,
that
was
the
only
case
i
know
of.
otherwise
it's
practically
automatic.
as
soon
--
and
then
some
of
the
courts
even
without
asking
the
man
will
automatically
assume
if
he's
in
prison
that
he's
indigent,
they
won't
even
send
this
form
out
and
they'll
appoint
counsel.
now,
after
counsel
was
appointed,
he
gets
his
record
from
the
client.
many
times
the
client
has
the
record
he's
in
prison,
the
lawyers
will
come
into
the
court's
office
and
look
at
the
court's
copy
of
the
record
or
they'll
come
to
our
office
and
borrow
our
copy.
however,
he
has
the
record.
now
if
there's
any
error
at
all,
and
this
is
to
a
paid
counsel
or
counsel
for
indigents,
then
counsel's
obligation
undoubtedly
is
to
point
that
error
out
to
the
court
by
writing
a
brief
and
putting
his
client's
best
foot
forward.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
at
all
we
think
it's
done
practically
all
the
time
depending
again
on
the
ability
of
counsel
to
recognize
error
in
the
record,
after
that's
done,
if
a
brief
is
written
of
course
we
get
into
the
normal
type
of
an
appeal.
now,
the
matter
is
set
for
hearing.
it's
been
my
experience
watching
appeals
for
about
seven
years
very
closely,
six
years,
that
oral
argument
in
the
district
courts
of
appeal
at
least
in
los
angeles
particularly
where
about
60%
of
all
appeals
are
handled
is
actually
more
of
a
fiction
than
a
fact,
and
this
is
true
with
paid
counsel
as
well
as
indigent
counsel,
because
we
find
--
i
personally,
i
just
thought
about
it
last
evening
have
handled
about
450
appeals
in
three
years.
i
don't
believe
i
have
orally
argued
more
than
possibly
50
out
of
those
450,
and
many
of
those
included
paid
counsel.
now
we
do
find
as
a
practical
matter
that
when
somebody
comes
in
and
it's
a
very
notorious
case
perhaps
where
they
have
gone
out
and
hired
the
best
counsel
their
money
can
buy,
we
find
that
those
counsel
will
come
in
for
the
rich
man
and
they
will
make
an
argument.
but
it's
a
make
wait
argument,
but
it's
done
perhaps
more
to
impress
the
client
than
the
court.
and
it's
my
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
arguments
where
--
received
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
a
maximum
of
a
half
hour
aside
your
honor.
as
a
general
practice,
when
cases
are
argued,
i
would
say
oral
argument
for
each
side
rarely
goes
over
ten
minutes.
many
times,
oral
argument
consists
of
a
counsel
standing
up
and
saying
that,
“unless
the
court
has
questions,
we
will
submit
it
on
the
briefs
and
on
the
record”.
this
is
true
in
many
cases
that
are
just
set
for
oral
argument.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
would
say
that
is
true.
now
in
different
parts
of
the
state,
in
some
of
the
smaller
areas,
they
encourage
oral
argument
a
little
more.
and
i
really
think
it's
a
question
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
courts
really
encourage
it,
perhaps
you
could
sometimes
tell
from
the
tone
of
voice
of
the
judge,
the
presiding
judge,
whether
they
want
to
hear
your
argument
or
not.
and
i
know
that
in
some
of
the
courts,
we
have
more
argument
but
they
have
a
lower
case
load.
we
are
running
now
this
fiscal
year,
we
haven't
got
the
full
figures
projected,
about
2000
appeals
a
year.
last
fiscal
year,
there
were
1634
criminal
appeals
and
felony
cases
in
california.
it's
increased
about
25%.
of
that
2000
appeals
in
round
numbers,
i
would
say
that
we
get
about
10%,
well
perhaps
let
me
take
it
a
different
way.
of
that
2000
appeals,
about
20%
are
paid
counsel,
of
400
appeals,
the
rest
are
indigent
counsel.
and
of
the
1600
indigent
appeals
left,
we
probably
run
about
10%
of
appeals
where
they
say
no
merit
in
a
letter
like
this,
although
this
is
becoming
less
frequent,
or
they
write
what
i
call
a
straw
man
brief
where
they
set
up
the
points
involved
if
they
think
might
be
arguable,
search
and
seizure
or
perhaps
the
escobedo
rule
or
something
like
that.
and
then
they
show
how
their
case
does
not
come
under
those
rules
and
then
the
conclusion
is
there
is
no
merit.
i
think
that's
a
lot
worse,
but
that
seems
to
be
the
district
of
columbia
policy.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
alright,
now
i'm
going
to
asked
that
your
honor.
what
happens
is
this
that
the
bar
has
undertaken
throughout
the
state
to
aid
indigents
in
trial
and
in
appeal.
there
is
no
state
public
defender
system
for
appeal.
we
do
have
it
in
many
counties
for
trial.
mr.
george
j.
roth
not
for
appeals
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
not
for
appeals.
the
public
defender
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
will
appeal
cases
of
his
clients
that
he
feels
might
affect
the
law
and
change
the
law.
otherwise
normally
he
will
not
handle
it.
the
bar
throughout
the
state
with
rare
exceptions
the
talent
for
this
appellate
counsel
comes
from
volunteers.
most
of
the
volunteers
are
attorneys
who
have
never
had
an
appeal
and
they
want
to
get
some
experience.
and
they
take
one,
and
then
they
two
and
three
and
before
they
know
it
they've
taken
quite
a
few.
and
i
guess
then
they
get
busy
and
then
it
switches
around.
and
this
is
actually
what
happens.there
are
a
number
of
attorneys
who
are
experienced
practitioners
who
take
appeals
and
we
see
them
filing
appeals
two,
three
a
month.
in
fact,
there's
one
attorney
i
know
who
had
retired
and
took
about
30
appeals
and
had
them
all
running,
and
now
the
writ
writers
in
the
prisons
are
complaining
that
he's
taking
too
many
appeals
he
can't
handle
their
case
properly.
so
this
is
practically
what
happens
in
our
state,
the
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes,
usually
it's
on
a
list,
on
a
rotation
list.the
clerk
usually
call
somebody
up
and
says,
“i
have
a
case
for
you.”
mr.
george
j.
roth
they
--
there's
a
statutory
provision
your
honor,
they
get
a
token
fee.
it
runs
--
it's
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
it
runs
from
about
$50,
maybe
$25
in
some
cases
to
possibly
$200
or
$250.
let's
say
the
average
is
about
150
or
125
depending
on
the
length
of
the
record.
it
really
doesn't
depend
on
whether
they
write
a
brief
for
it,
whether
or
not
they
write
a
brief.
they
write
a
no-merit
letter
depends
on
the
record.
i
think
the
court
feels
it's
dealing
with
volunteers.
it
has
faith
in
the
integrity
and
the
ability
of
the
people
who
it
appoints
and
this
is
a
situation
that
results
from.
now,
it's
very
easy
to
say,
“well,
if
the
first
lawyer
doesn't
think
there's
any
merit,
give
him
another
lawyer”.
and
that's
what
iowa
suggesting
tomorrows
case
ensminger,
but
iowa
had
60
appeals
last
year,
we
had
2000.
it's
a
problem
to
get
lawyers
for
appeals
and
as
i
say,
most
of
them
are
volunteers.
in
los
angeles
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
don't
know
if
the
compensation
would
justify.
i
think
this
your
honor,
that
some
lawyers
just
starting
out
undoubtedly
do,
but
they
find
that
the
time
that
they
put
in
on
it
is
not
the
compensation.
and
those
lawyers
who
possibly
do
that
may
not
continue
volunteering
for
too
long.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
know
of
numbers
your
honor,
one
lawyer
--
and
this
is
within
a
short
period
of
time.
this
particular
attorney
i'm
thinking
of
is
retired.
in
fact
he's
a
former
member
of
our
staff
and
he's
very
competent
and
very
capable
to
handle
this
type
of
matter.
now
on
the
other
hand
i
know
of
an
attorney
who
is
in
private
practice
and
who
specializes
primarily
in
federal
income
tax
cases,
and
he
in
los
angeles
sets
up
seminar
classes
for
volunteers
and
handles
enumerable
appeals
himself
throughout
the
year.
and
he
has
people
from
our
office
as
well
as
learned
defense
counsel
from
the
area
come
and
actually
have
lectures
and
so
on
to
his
people
to
try
and
help
them.
but
then
we
come
to
this
case.
and
this
case
i
think
is
different
than
any
other
cases
i've
read.
i
think
it's
different
than
any
of
the
cases
that
i
know
about.
i
learned
about
the
swenson
case
this
morning
and
i
think
it's
different
from
the
swenson
case,
because
in
the
swenson
case,
the
attorney
appointed
for
the
missouri
defendant
in
the
trial
went
through
the
trial
and
filed
a
very
specific
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
showed
what
the
points
were
and
showed
there
was
error.
but
in
this
case,
we
come
to
the
cardinal
problem
of
what
do
you
do
when
a
competent
counsel
looks
at
the
record
and
he
says,
“there
is
no
error”.
and
we
know
from
our
experience
that
it's
running
somewhere
about
10%
of
the
cases
(inaudible)
the
cases
only
that
are
appealed.
and
so
i
think
we
have
to
say
to
ourselves
what
does
due
process
require.
i
think
it
requires
a
meaningful
appeal.
i
don't
think
it
requires
an
attorney
to
make
up
error
when
he
knows
there
is
none.
and
there's
bound
to
be
some
cases
of
this
large
group
where
there
is
no
error,
and
if
the
court
has
faith
in
its
bar
it
can
accept
the
attorney's
word,
but
they
go
further
in
california.
even
though
they
have
faith
in
the
bar,
the
court
itself
very
carefully
goes
over
that
record.
now
the
court
in
california
does
not
only
look,
into
my
knowledge,
to
the
points
raised
by
the
defendant.
there's
almost
a
rivalry
betweenthe
law
clerks
for
the
courts
and
the
deputy
attorney
generals
to
see
if
the
lower
courts
for
the
courts
can
pick
up
some
point
that
the
indigent
counsel
didn't
find.
every
once
in
awhile
and
of
course
this
is
not
as
an
advocate
but
as
amicus
the
attorney
general
in
california
will
raise
a
point
to
the
court
even
if
there's
paid
counsel
which
we
find
was
ignored.
we
have
about
70
deputies
handling
criminal
matters
alone
in
california
and
that's
how
vast
the
volume
is.
there
are
also
about
2000
post
appellate
writs
a
year
coming
out.
and
some
of
these
are
subject
to
appeal
and
some
are
not.
in
coram
nobis
they
are,
in
habeas
corpus
they're
not.
now
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
your
honor,
we
can
move
for
dismissal.
let
me
say
this,
we
can
move
in
any
case
but
--
and
sometimes
we
do
but
it's
frequently
not
granted
to
specifically
get
to,
i
think
what
you're
driving
at.
there's
a
certain
type
of
an
appeal
where
we
can
move
to
dismiss
by
statute,
and
that
is
an
appeal
where
somebody
has
pleaded
guilty.
we've
just
changed
the
california
law
that
points
out
now
that
where
a
man
pleads
guilty,
he
must
get
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
from
the
trial
court
before
he
can
take
an
appeal
from
the
plea
of
guilty.
other
than
that,
we
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
there's
no
procedure
your
honor.
sometimes
we
have
made
motions
to
dismiss
for
extreme
frivolity
and
the
courts
just
deny
our
motion.
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
appeal
as
it
does
in
the
other
states.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
your
honor,
no.
this
appeal,
if
the
petitioner
had
not
written
anything
would
have
still
been
studied.
now
in
california,
our
judges
on
these
panels
use
the
conference
system.
they
have
--
each
one
has
a
research
clerk.
i
presume
the
chief
in
each
particular
panel
assigns
the
cases
equitably
among
the
justices
and
they
work
their
cases
over.
the
judges
and
the
research
attorney
assigned
to
the
particular
case
give
it
a
thorough
fly
specking,
and
then
the
rest
of
the
court
gets
that
memorandum.
they
have
a
conference
on
it,
and
if
there's
oral
argument,
they
have
oral
argument,
they
have
another
conference.
as
i
say,
in
most
of
the
case
or
the
cases
are
submitted
without
oral
argument.
now,
as
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
they
used
this
conference
system
for
all
appeals,
and
of
course
the
2000
appeals
i
was
talking
about
were
only
criminal
appeals.
there
are
a
tremendous
number
of
civil
appeals
as
you
can
well
imagine.
was
there
another
question?
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
he
ever
could
because
he'd
be
violating
the
confidential
communication
between
attorney
and
client.
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
if
he
doesn't
write
a
brief
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
error,
then
your
honor,
i
agree
he
has
the
responsibility
but
the
confidentialness
does
not
exist
in
this
situation
because
he
has
to
tell
the
court
something
so
they
know
what
to
do
so
they
can
either
tell
the
man
to
write
your
own
brief
or
if
the
court
--
and
if
the
court
gets
his
brief
and
they
think
there's
merit.
i
know
of
cases
where
they
have
appointed
other
counsel
and
--
or
if
the
court
looks
at
it
itself
without
appointing
other
counsel,
without
any
brief
from
the
indigent.
i
know
of
cases
where
the
court
has
appointed
other
counsel.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
think
that
anybody
is
privately
retained.
however,
we
must
remember
this,
we
don't
know
how
many
lawyers
have
told
that
client,
“there
is
no
merit
to
your
case
and
i
won't
take
your
money”.
and
this
comes
to
another
point
because
i
think
that
we
tend
to
look
at
the
rich
and
the
poor
and
we
ask
for
equality
not
of
talent
perhaps,
but
equality
of
treatment.
and
i
think
that
when
we
stop
and
realize,
there's
some
--
i
looked
at
the
figures
downstairs
in
the
law
library
earlier
today
and
they
had
a
1964
california
criminal
statistics
book
that
showed
something
like
30,000
felony
trials
a
year
and
21,000
which
convictions
were
obtained.
now
out
of
21,000
that
took
20,000
convictions,
you
only
have
2000
people
appealed.most
of
those
can
get
a
free
lawyer.
the
other
people
can
pay
for
it,
but
i
firmly
believe
that
we
can
conclude
from
this
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
improper
to
do
so
that
we
can
conclude
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
people
who
don't
appeal
are
the
poor
--
i
call
them
poor,
they're
the
middle-class
people
with
a
mortgage
and
three
kids
and
a
lot
of
debts
and
they
have
too
much
money
so
they're
not
considered
indigent
and
they
don't
have
enough
money
to
go
wasted.
and
they
go
to
their
client
and
--
or
rather
they
go
their
attorney
in
private
practice
and
he
says
to
them,
“look,
i've
looked
at
your
record
and
i
don't
want
to
take
your
money”.
now,
i
don't
think
this
is
strange.
i
practice
privately
in
a
small
community
for
ten
years
and
i
have
this
experience.
and
i'm
sure
some
of
the
justices
on
this
bench
in
their
early
years
may
have
had
the
same
experience.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no.
mr.
george
j.
roth
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
i
don't
think
that
an
injury
practically
will
result
and
i
would
like
to
state
why.
the
young
lawyer,
whoever
he
is
whether
he's
young
or
old,
when
he
gets
his
first
appeal
he's
inexperienced.
but
after
he
takes
a
few,
he's
experienced.
and
what
happen
--
i
mean
even
people
who
come
before
this
court,
the
first
time
they
come
they're
inexperienced
arguing
before
this
type
of
an
appellate
court.
however,
once
they've
had
the
experience,
they're
experienced
attorneys.
to
follow
it
through
a
little
further,
when
the
attorney
says
there's
no
merit
and
whether
he's
young
or
old
if
he's
inexperienced,
he's
a
volunteer
we
must
remember.
he's
trying
to
do
this
to
learn.
he's
trying
to
do
this
because
he
feels
for
the
underdog.
he
wants
to
help
the
indigent
persons
and
he
exerts
his
best
efforts.
i
think
that
we
do
a
great
disjustice
to
the
bar
when
we
say
that
the
bar
is
lazy,
that
the
bar
has
feelings
that
they
want
to
be
amicus.
that
the
bar
has
feelings
of
sloppiness
in
handling
the
record
because
of
the
fact
that
--
and
this
is
pure
supposition,
because
of
the
fact
that
i
think
that
the
basis
of
justice
in
this
country
is
solid
if
and
only
if
we
have
one
thing
and
that
is
a
faith
in
the
integrity
of
the
people
who
are
handling
the
cases
for
the
clients.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
what
i
suggest
in
a
case
like
this
your
honor
is
that
this
court
after
it
determines
just
where
the
position
of
the
american
bar
should
be
when
there
is
no
merit
in
the
brief
that
this
court
then
make
some
promulgation
so
that
the
due
process
standard,
whatever
it
may
be,
and
i
think
that
this
one
certainly
satisfies
it,
that
the
due
process
standard
would
be
equal
throughout
the
united
states.
not
only
in
the
state
courts
but
in
the
federal
courts
as
well,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
take
a
case,
this
particular
case,
and
compare
it
to
a
case
in
a
court
where
they
don't
trust
their
bar
and
they've
said
so
in
one
way
or
another,
and
then
they
take
memorandums
from
the
bar
primarily
to
see
if
the
lawyer
has
done
his
homework.
and
depending
on
the
strength
of
the
memorandum,
they
dismiss
the
case
without
even
looking
at
the
record.
i
think
perhaps
that
at
least,
i
don't
want
to
say
that's
a
bad
standards,
but
i
say
our
standard
is
at
least
as
good
as
that
one
your
honor.
and
i'm
specifically
referring
to
some
of
the
federal
jurisdictions.
now
i
think
one
thing
more
that
i
--
interest
me
greatly,
and
that
is,
what
is
an
appeal?and
i
believe
it's
different
than
a
trial.
trial,
we
say
is
a
search
for
truth
and
an
appeal
is
a
search
for
error.
and
the
appeal
is
something
that's
measurable.
it's
confined
all
around.
it's
got
some
record.
if
it's
not
in
the
record,
you
don't
have
an
appeal.
you
might
have
a
collateral
attack
in
habeas
corpus
or
some
other
matters.
you
do
not
have
an
appeal,
it's
something
that
only
a
trained
person
can
look
at
and
evaluate.
as
i
say
--
said
before,
said
at
my
brief,
we
can't
give
everybody
clarence
darrow,
but
by
the
same
token,
we
give
them
lawyers
who
are
trained,
technical
people.
and
i
don't
think
it
matters
that
the
man
in
the
prison
feels
bad
or
has
some
idea
that
there's
something
wrong
with
his
case.
i
think
his
lawyer
should
consult
with
him
to
find
out
what
he
has
in
mind.
but
he
can
not
evaluate
that
record
unless
he's
the
trained
expert
that
the
lawyer
is.
and
it's
this
mesurement,
and
it's
this
objectivity
to
me
that
distinguishes
regardless
of
what
the
client
says
in
the
prison,
the
error
either
is
or
is
not
in
the
record.
and
if
the
lawyer
looks
and
says,
“there's
no
error”
and
then
the
court
looks
and
does
not
find
any
error,
it
seems
to
me
rather
futile
to
say
that
the
court
should
appoint
another
attorney
to
go
out
and
look
and
see
if
there's
more
error.
and
it's
like
the
old
principle
about
carrying
the
cow
at
the
county
fair.
how
far
do
you
go?
when
do
you
stop?
does
due
process
require
--
due
process
requires
two
lawyers
to
look
then
due
process
requires
20
lawyers
to
look
until
somebody
comes
up
with
some
type
of
an
argument
that
may
or
may
not
carry
any
weight
just
because
of
its
novelty.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
obvious
that
this
matter
would
come
up
--
it
comes
up
to
your
honors
through
a
different
route
too.
and
it
comes
through
habeas
corpus,
for
example,
through
the
federal
courts
or
it
comes
through
direct
certiorari
from
the
appeal
and
the
representation
is
made.
and
i
think
in
those
situations
that
the
court
should
order
a
reference
to
find
out
what
the
true
situation
is
if
it
doesn't
appear
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
of
course
today,
he
can
go
right
directly
to
the
federal
court
immediately
as
i
understand
the
law.
and
he
doesn't
have
to
wait
a
couple
of
years,
and
the
federal
judge
can
make
that
determination.
mr.
george
j.
roth
true.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
--
to
answer
your
honor's
question
in
a
different
way
and
as
many
counsel
have
done
in
the
last
several
days,
that
doesn't
happen
in
california,
that
particular
hypothetical
question.
mr.
george
j.
roth
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
appellate
court
in
its
integrity,
and
i
think
narrower
on
the
level
of
the
integrity
of
the
appellate
court,
that
the
appellate
court
in
its
integrity
will
look
at
that
record,
and
if
it
at
least
--
it
has
to
be
in
the
record
in
order
to
be
raised
in
an
appeal.
and
if
it's
in
the
record,
i
think
the
appellate
court
will
find
it
under
the
california
system
in
the
point
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
i
agree
it's
not.
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
your
honor,
this
would
have
to
appear
in
a
record
however
in
order
to
be
brought
up
on
appeal.
you
--
and
under
our
system
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
this
record
is
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
it
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no.
true,
but
your
honor,
his
record
is
made
by
the
trial
counsel
in
the
trial
court.
and
if
it's
not
made
there
then
his
remedy
is
not
on
appeal,
it's
by
habeas
corpus.
and
i
--
i
saw
at
least
--
as
i
look
at
the
appeals,
the
appeals
are
from
records
and
if
there's
something
outside
the
record,
you
have
to
go
in
a
different
way
and
make
a
different
record.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
think
it
does,
yes.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
think
this
so
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
if
there's
nothing
there,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
i
can
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
whether
there
is
and
i
agree
your
honor.
and
what
is
the
attorney
to
do?
this
is
the
problem
as
i
see
it.
what
is
the
attorney
to
do
who
conscientiously
studies
the
record,
talks
to
his
client?
he
can
be
the
best
attorney
in
town,
he's
got
an
indigent
client
then
he
can't
find
anything.
now
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
with
--
but
it's
a
different
attorney
your
honor
that
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
--
at
the
trial
level
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
the
point
is
your
honor
that
had
there
been
one
there,
we
assume
that
his
trial
lawyer
would've
made
that.
again,
we're
now
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
this
happens
in
many
cases
your
honor,
and
yet
people
still
appeal.
mr.
george
j.
roth
huh?
pardon?
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
he
still
gets
his
appeal
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
he
has
the
court
look
at
his
record
completely.
that
the
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
and
we
have
to
assume
that
the
courts
have
integrity
when
they
look.
mr.
george
j.
roth
and
if
the
error
is
there,
well,
i
--
just
to
give
you
an
example,
i
saw
one
person,
an
attorney
who
had
a
paying
client,
we're
in
court
and
he
said
to
one
of
my
colleagues,
“my
client
is
an
ex-convict
who
is
charged
with
carrying
a
gun.
do
you
think
that
i
should
just
throw
in
an
argument
that
perhaps
under
the
federal
constitution,
this
impairs
his
right
to
bear
arms?”
and
he
said,
“i've
got
a
paying
client”.
to
have
maybe
might
sound
good,
now
he
knew
this
was
the
type
of
a
point
at
least
that
he
didn't
have
any
faith
in.
and
this
is
the
problem.
what
is
the
attorney
to
do
when
he
looks
at
a
record
and
his
professional
judgment
there
is
nothing
to
argue
about?
now,
this
is
it,
what
does
he
do?
does
he
say
to
the
court,
“gentlemen,
there's
a
statute
that
says
the
judge's
robes
must
be
eight
inches
off
the
floor
and
i
notice
that
one
of
the
judges
had
a
robe
on
that
was
16
inches
off
the
floor”.
you
know,
it's
one
of
these
things
that
it's
a
make
way
to
argument,
or
does
he
say,
“well
my
client
was
questioned
by
the
police
department
ten
years
ago
and
that
questioning
led
to
his
trial.
that
happened
after
the
opinion
of
this
court
recently
in
people
against
johnson,
and
therefore
he
plead
guilty
or
it
happened
after
his
trial
and
therefore
his
case
should
be
different
and
the
united
states
supreme
court
decision
should
be
reversed”.
i
don't
think
counsel's
obligations
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
--
to
do
that
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes.
mr.
george
j.
roth
true.
mr.
george
j.
roth
it
could
very
well
be
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
george
j.
roth
honorable
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
start
with
an
explanation
of
the
appellate
system
in
california
because
i
believe
there's
a
little
misconception
perhaps,
and
i'm
sure
it's
unintentional
with
actually
what
happens
as
a
practical
matter.
first
of
all,
traditionally
in
our
state,
the
attorney's
obligation
to
the
client
ends
at
the
trial
level
stage
after
the
judgment
is
entered,
after
the
man
in
this
case,
was
sent
to
prison.he
was
represented
by
the
public
defender
of
the
county
of
merced.
traditionally,
this
is
true
with
paid
clients
as
well
as
indigent
clients.
then,
after
the
judgment
is
entered
under
our
statute,
rather
under
our
rules
i
should
of
court
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
there
are
motions
for
new
trial
your
honor,
they
are
made
--
they're
not
required
for
the
appeal.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
appeal
except
in
one
case
where
a
man
is
committed
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
trial
counsel
makes
the
motion
for
new
trial
your
honor.
if
and
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
oh,
yes
your
honor,
many
times.
what
happens
is
we
find,
in
looking
at
records
in
paid
counsel
cases
as
well
as
appointed
counsel
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
question
your
honor,
they
get
a
full
record,
they
get
a
transcript
of
all
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that
was
true
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
motion
for
new
trial
on
my
knowledge
your
honor.
now,
many
times
--
to
follow
up
on
your
honor's
question,
we
find
with
paid
counsel
as
well
as
with
appellate
counsel,
they
will
say
to
the
court,
“i
would
like
to
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
all
of
the
statutory
grounds”,
and
they
offer
no
other
points.
this
did
not
happen
here
to
my
recollection
your
honor.
what
happens
after
the
judgment
is
entered
and
the
obligation
of
the
trial
lawyer
has
ended.
the
man
himself
in
the
old
days
used
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
which
could
be
in
a
very
simple
form
or
letter
to
the
trial
court
and
the
notice
of
appeal
goes
to
the
trial
court.
today,
under
recent
cases,
there's
probably
a
further
obligation
on
trial
counsel
to
see
that
his
man
gets
a
notice
of
appeal
filed
if
he
wants
one.
that
automatically
starts
the
procedure
whereby
the
clerk's
minutes
are
transcribed
and
the
complete
report
as
transcript
is
made.
that
under
today's
procedure
a
normal
record
even
includes
instructions
given
and
received.
there
is
an
extra
normal
record
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
it's
been
changed
to
add
normal
record
without
even
requesting
it
to
include
instructions
your
honor.
in
the
old
days,
when
this
case
was
before
the
bar,
the
procedure
was
and
it's
still
is
with
everything
except
instructions
that
the
appellant
or
his
attorney
later
on,
when
he's
appointed
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
that,
can
request
extension
of
the
normal
record.
most
of
the
time,
it
seems
that
the
court's
grant
it.
in
this
case,
i
think
the
court
concede
the
man
got
almost
everything
that
they
had.
and
so,
then
what
happens
is
the
mechanical
process
of
transcribing
the
record
goes
along.
when
it's
finally
completed
three
copies
are
made
by
the
rules
and
this
is
whether
the
man
is
poor
or
rich,
everybody
gets
the
same
treatment.
there's
no
charge
for
it.
no
charge
to
appeal.
the
--
one
copy
of
the
record
goes
to
the
court,
one
copy
goes
to
the
appellant
if
--
or
his
attorney
if
he
has
an
attorney,
and
one
copy
goes
to
the
attorney
general.
then
after
that,
when
the
record
gets
to
the
appellate
court,
they
immediately
are
aware
that
there
is
no
counsel
in
an
indigent
case.
the
general
practice
with
most
of
the
district
courts
of
appeal,
there
are
presently
five
courts
of
appeal
composed
of
13
panels
of
three
judges
altogether.
and
the
general
practice
in
most
of
the
districts
at
the
present
time,
and
it
goes
back
some
years,
i
can't
say
exactly
when,
is
for
the
clerk
to
notify
the
appellant
that
the
appeal
is
before
the
court.
that
he
has
received
his
transcript.
they
notice
he
has
no
attorney,
and
they
ask
him,
“would
you
like
an
attorney
appointed?
you
are
entitled
to
one
if
you
cannot
afford
it”.
they
usually
send
some
type
of
a
pauperis
statement
that'd
be
filled
out
under
penalty
of
perjury,
and
it
comes
back
like
an
affidavit.
then
if
the
man
says
he
wants
counsel
and
he's
an
indigent,
to
my
recollection,
i
think
there's
only
one
case
i
know
of
in
the
last
four
or
five
years
where
they
even
doubted
the
man's
statement.
i
happen
to
be
in
court
at
the
time
accidentally
where
i
saw
the
court's
questioning
the
man
orally.
he
was
out
on
bail
and
they
wondered
about
it.
but
otherwise,
to
my
knowledge
any
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor,
that
was
the
only
case
i
know
of.
otherwise
it's
practically
automatic.
as
soon
--
and
then
some
of
the
courts
even
without
asking
the
man
will
automatically
assume
if
he's
in
prison
that
he's
indigent,
they
won't
even
send
this
form
out
and
they'll
appoint
counsel.
now,
after
counsel
was
appointed,
he
gets
his
record
from
the
client.
many
times
the
client
has
the
record
he's
in
prison,
the
lawyers
will
come
into
the
court's
office
and
look
at
the
court's
copy
of
the
record
or
they'll
come
to
our
office
and
borrow
our
copy.
however,
he
has
the
record.
now
if
there's
any
error
at
all,
and
this
is
to
a
paid
counsel
or
counsel
for
indigents,
then
counsel's
obligation
undoubtedly
is
to
point
that
error
out
to
the
court
by
writing
a
brief
and
putting
his
client's
best
foot
forward.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
at
all
we
think
it's
done
practically
all
the
time
depending
again
on
the
ability
of
counsel
to
recognize
error
in
the
record,
after
that's
done,
if
a
brief
is
written
of
course
we
get
into
the
normal
type
of
an
appeal.
now,
the
matter
is
set
for
hearing.
it's
been
my
experience
watching
appeals
for
about
seven
years
very
closely,
six
years,
that
oral
argument
in
the
district
courts
of
appeal
at
least
in
los
angeles
particularly
where
about
60%
of
all
appeals
are
handled
is
actually
more
of
a
fiction
than
a
fact,
and
this
is
true
with
paid
counsel
as
well
as
indigent
counsel,
because
we
find
--
i
personally,
i
just
thought
about
it
last
evening
have
handled
about
450
appeals
in
three
years.
i
don't
believe
i
have
orally
argued
more
than
possibly
50
out
of
those
450,
and
many
of
those
included
paid
counsel.
now
we
do
find
as
a
practical
matter
that
when
somebody
comes
in
and
it's
a
very
notorious
case
perhaps
where
they
have
gone
out
and
hired
the
best
counsel
their
money
can
buy,
we
find
that
those
counsel
will
come
in
for
the
rich
man
and
they
will
make
an
argument.
but
it's
a
make
wait
argument,
but
it's
done
perhaps
more
to
impress
the
client
than
the
court.
and
it's
my
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
arguments
where
--
received
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
a
maximum
of
a
half
hour
aside
your
honor.
as
a
general
practice,
when
cases
are
argued,
i
would
say
oral
argument
for
each
side
rarely
goes
over
ten
minutes.
many
times,
oral
argument
consists
of
a
counsel
standing
up
and
saying
that,
“unless
the
court
has
questions,
we
will
submit
it
on
the
briefs
and
on
the
record”.
this
is
true
in
many
cases
that
are
just
set
for
oral
argument.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
would
say
that
is
true.
now
in
different
parts
of
the
state,
in
some
of
the
smaller
areas,
they
encourage
oral
argument
a
little
more.
and
i
really
think
it's
a
question
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
courts
really
encourage
it,
perhaps
you
could
sometimes
tell
from
the
tone
of
voice
of
the
judge,
the
presiding
judge,
whether
they
want
to
hear
your
argument
or
not.
and
i
know
that
in
some
of
the
courts,
we
have
more
argument
but
they
have
a
lower
case
load.
we
are
running
now
this
fiscal
year,
we
haven't
got
the
full
figures
projected,
about
2000
appeals
a
year.
last
fiscal
year,
there
were
1634
criminal
appeals
and
felony
cases
in
california.
it's
increased
about
25%.
of
that
2000
appeals
in
round
numbers,
i
would
say
that
we
get
about
10%,
well
perhaps
let
me
take
it
a
different
way.
of
that
2000
appeals,
about
20%
are
paid
counsel,
of
400
appeals,
the
rest
are
indigent
counsel.
and
of
the
1600
indigent
appeals
left,
we
probably
run
about
10%
of
appeals
where
they
say
no
merit
in
a
letter
like
this,
although
this
is
becoming
less
frequent,
or
they
write
what
i
call
a
straw
man
brief
where
they
set
up
the
points
involved
if
they
think
might
be
arguable,
search
and
seizure
or
perhaps
the
escobedo
rule
or
something
like
that.
and
then
they
show
how
their
case
does
not
come
under
those
rules
and
then
the
conclusion
is
there
is
no
merit.
i
think
that's
a
lot
worse,
but
that
seems
to
be
the
district
of
columbia
policy.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
alright,
now
i'm
going
to
asked
that
your
honor.
what
happens
is
this
that
the
bar
has
undertaken
throughout
the
state
to
aid
indigents
in
trial
and
in
appeal.
there
is
no
state
public
defender
system
for
appeal.
we
do
have
it
in
many
counties
for
trial.
mr.
george
j.
roth
not
for
appeals
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
not
for
appeals.
the
public
defender
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
will
appeal
cases
of
his
clients
that
he
feels
might
affect
the
law
and
change
the
law.
otherwise
normally
he
will
not
handle
it.
the
bar
throughout
the
state
with
rare
exceptions
the
talent
for
this
appellate
counsel
comes
from
volunteers.
most
of
the
volunteers
are
attorneys
who
have
never
had
an
appeal
and
they
want
to
get
some
experience.
and
they
take
one,
and
then
they
two
and
three
and
before
they
know
it
they've
taken
quite
a
few.
and
i
guess
then
they
get
busy
and
then
it
switches
around.
and
this
is
actually
what
happens.there
are
a
number
of
attorneys
who
are
experienced
practitioners
who
take
appeals
and
we
see
them
filing
appeals
two,
three
a
month.
in
fact,
there's
one
attorney
i
know
who
had
retired
and
took
about
30
appeals
and
had
them
all
running,
and
now
the
writ
writers
in
the
prisons
are
complaining
that
he's
taking
too
many
appeals
he
can't
handle
their
case
properly.
so
this
is
practically
what
happens
in
our
state,
the
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes,
usually
it's
on
a
list,
on
a
rotation
list.the
clerk
usually
call
somebody
up
and
says,
“i
have
a
case
for
you.”
mr.
george
j.
roth
they
--
there's
a
statutory
provision
your
honor,
they
get
a
token
fee.
it
runs
--
it's
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
it
runs
from
about
$50,
maybe
$25
in
some
cases
to
possibly
$200
or
$250.
let's
say
the
average
is
about
150
or
125
depending
on
the
length
of
the
record.
it
really
doesn't
depend
on
whether
they
write
a
brief
for
it,
whether
or
not
they
write
a
brief.
they
write
a
no-merit
letter
depends
on
the
record.
i
think
the
court
feels
it's
dealing
with
volunteers.
it
has
faith
in
the
integrity
and
the
ability
of
the
people
who
it
appoints
and
this
is
a
situation
that
results
from.
now,
it's
very
easy
to
say,
“well,
if
the
first
lawyer
doesn't
think
there's
any
merit,
give
him
another
lawyer”.
and
that's
what
iowa
suggesting
tomorrows
case
ensminger,
but
iowa
had
60
appeals
last
year,
we
had
2000.
it's
a
problem
to
get
lawyers
for
appeals
and
as
i
say,
most
of
them
are
volunteers.
in
los
angeles
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
don't
know
if
the
compensation
would
justify.
i
think
this
your
honor,
that
some
lawyers
just
starting
out
undoubtedly
do,
but
they
find
that
the
time
that
they
put
in
on
it
is
not
the
compensation.
and
those
lawyers
who
possibly
do
that
may
not
continue
volunteering
for
too
long.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
know
of
numbers
your
honor,
one
lawyer
--
and
this
is
within
a
short
period
of
time.
this
particular
attorney
i'm
thinking
of
is
retired.
in
fact
he's
a
former
member
of
our
staff
and
he's
very
competent
and
very
capable
to
handle
this
type
of
matter.
now
on
the
other
hand
i
know
of
an
attorney
who
is
in
private
practice
and
who
specializes
primarily
in
federal
income
tax
cases,
and
he
in
los
angeles
sets
up
seminar
classes
for
volunteers
and
handles
enumerable
appeals
himself
throughout
the
year.
and
he
has
people
from
our
office
as
well
as
learned
defense
counsel
from
the
area
come
and
actually
have
lectures
and
so
on
to
his
people
to
try
and
help
them.
but
then
we
come
to
this
case.
and
this
case
i
think
is
different
than
any
other
cases
i've
read.
i
think
it's
different
than
any
of
the
cases
that
i
know
about.
i
learned
about
the
swenson
case
this
morning
and
i
think
it's
different
from
the
swenson
case,
because
in
the
swenson
case,
the
attorney
appointed
for
the
missouri
defendant
in
the
trial
went
through
the
trial
and
filed
a
very
specific
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
showed
what
the
points
were
and
showed
there
was
error.
but
in
this
case,
we
come
to
the
cardinal
problem
of
what
do
you
do
when
a
competent
counsel
looks
at
the
record
and
he
says,
“there
is
no
error”.
and
we
know
from
our
experience
that
it's
running
somewhere
about
10%
of
the
cases
(inaudible)
the
cases
only
that
are
appealed.
and
so
i
think
we
have
to
say
to
ourselves
what
does
due
process
require.
i
think
it
requires
a
meaningful
appeal.
i
don't
think
it
requires
an
attorney
to
make
up
error
when
he
knows
there
is
none.
and
there's
bound
to
be
some
cases
of
this
large
group
where
there
is
no
error,
and
if
the
court
has
faith
in
its
bar
it
can
accept
the
attorney's
word,
but
they
go
further
in
california.
even
though
they
have
faith
in
the
bar,
the
court
itself
very
carefully
goes
over
that
record.
now
the
court
in
california
does
not
only
look,
into
my
knowledge,
to
the
points
raised
by
the
defendant.
there's
almost
a
rivalry
betweenthe
law
clerks
for
the
courts
and
the
deputy
attorney
generals
to
see
if
the
lower
courts
for
the
courts
can
pick
up
some
point
that
the
indigent
counsel
didn't
find.
every
once
in
awhile
and
of
course
this
is
not
as
an
advocate
but
as
amicus
the
attorney
general
in
california
will
raise
a
point
to
the
court
even
if
there's
paid
counsel
which
we
find
was
ignored.
we
have
about
70
deputies
handling
criminal
matters
alone
in
california
and
that's
how
vast
the
volume
is.
there
are
also
about
2000
post
appellate
writs
a
year
coming
out.
and
some
of
these
are
subject
to
appeal
and
some
are
not.
in
coram
nobis
they
are,
in
habeas
corpus
they're
not.
now
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
your
honor,
we
can
move
for
dismissal.
let
me
say
this,
we
can
move
in
any
case
but
--
and
sometimes
we
do
but
it's
frequently
not
granted
to
specifically
get
to,
i
think
what
you're
driving
at.
there's
a
certain
type
of
an
appeal
where
we
can
move
to
dismiss
by
statute,
and
that
is
an
appeal
where
somebody
has
pleaded
guilty.
we've
just
changed
the
california
law
that
points
out
now
that
where
a
man
pleads
guilty,
he
must
get
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
from
the
trial
court
before
he
can
take
an
appeal
from
the
plea
of
guilty.
other
than
that,
we
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
there's
no
procedure
your
honor.
sometimes
we
have
made
motions
to
dismiss
for
extreme
frivolity
and
the
courts
just
deny
our
motion.
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
appeal
as
it
does
in
the
other
states.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
your
honor,
no.
this
appeal,
if
the
petitioner
had
not
written
anything
would
have
still
been
studied.
now
in
california,
our
judges
on
these
panels
use
the
conference
system.
they
have
--
each
one
has
a
research
clerk.
i
presume
the
chief
in
each
particular
panel
assigns
the
cases
equitably
among
the
justices
and
they
work
their
cases
over.
the
judges
and
the
research
attorney
assigned
to
the
particular
case
give
it
a
thorough
fly
specking,
and
then
the
rest
of
the
court
gets
that
memorandum.
they
have
a
conference
on
it,
and
if
there's
oral
argument,
they
have
oral
argument,
they
have
another
conference.
as
i
say,
in
most
of
the
case
or
the
cases
are
submitted
without
oral
argument.
now,
as
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
they
used
this
conference
system
for
all
appeals,
and
of
course
the
2000
appeals
i
was
talking
about
were
only
criminal
appeals.
there
are
a
tremendous
number
of
civil
appeals
as
you
can
well
imagine.
was
there
another
question?
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
he
ever
could
because
he'd
be
violating
the
confidential
communication
between
attorney
and
client.
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
if
he
doesn't
write
a
brief
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
error,
then
your
honor,
i
agree
he
has
the
responsibility
but
the
confidentialness
does
not
exist
in
this
situation
because
he
has
to
tell
the
court
something
so
they
know
what
to
do
so
they
can
either
tell
the
man
to
write
your
own
brief
or
if
the
court
--
and
if
the
court
gets
his
brief
and
they
think
there's
merit.
i
know
of
cases
where
they
have
appointed
other
counsel
and
--
or
if
the
court
looks
at
it
itself
without
appointing
other
counsel,
without
any
brief
from
the
indigent.
i
know
of
cases
where
the
court
has
appointed
other
counsel.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
think
that
anybody
is
privately
retained.
however,
we
must
remember
this,
we
don't
know
how
many
lawyers
have
told
that
client,
“there
is
no
merit
to
your
case
and
i
won't
take
your
money”.
and
this
comes
to
another
point
because
i
think
that
we
tend
to
look
at
the
rich
and
the
poor
and
we
ask
for
equality
not
of
talent
perhaps,
but
equality
of
treatment.
and
i
think
that
when
we
stop
and
realize,
there's
some
--
i
looked
at
the
figures
downstairs
in
the
law
library
earlier
today
and
they
had
a
1964
california
criminal
statistics
book
that
showed
something
like
30,000
felony
trials
a
year
and
21,000
which
convictions
were
obtained.
now
out
of
21,000
that
took
20,000
convictions,
you
only
have
2000
people
appealed.most
of
those
can
get
a
free
lawyer.
the
other
people
can
pay
for
it,
but
i
firmly
believe
that
we
can
conclude
from
this
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
improper
to
do
so
that
we
can
conclude
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
people
who
don't
appeal
are
the
poor
--
i
call
them
poor,
they're
the
middle-class
people
with
a
mortgage
and
three
kids
and
a
lot
of
debts
and
they
have
too
much
money
so
they're
not
considered
indigent
and
they
don't
have
enough
money
to
go
wasted.
and
they
go
to
their
client
and
--
or
rather
they
go
their
attorney
in
private
practice
and
he
says
to
them,
“look,
i've
looked
at
your
record
and
i
don't
want
to
take
your
money”.
now,
i
don't
think
this
is
strange.
i
practice
privately
in
a
small
community
for
ten
years
and
i
have
this
experience.
and
i'm
sure
some
of
the
justices
on
this
bench
in
their
early
years
may
have
had
the
same
experience.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no.
mr.
george
j.
roth
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
i
don't
think
that
an
injury
practically
will
result
and
i
would
like
to
state
why.
the
young
lawyer,
whoever
he
is
whether
he's
young
or
old,
when
he
gets
his
first
appeal
he's
inexperienced.
but
after
he
takes
a
few,
he's
experienced.
and
what
happen
--
i
mean
even
people
who
come
before
this
court,
the
first
time
they
come
they're
inexperienced
arguing
before
this
type
of
an
appellate
court.
however,
once
they've
had
the
experience,
they're
experienced
attorneys.
to
follow
it
through
a
little
further,
when
the
attorney
says
there's
no
merit
and
whether
he's
young
or
old
if
he's
inexperienced,
he's
a
volunteer
we
must
remember.
he's
trying
to
do
this
to
learn.
he's
trying
to
do
this
because
he
feels
for
the
underdog.
he
wants
to
help
the
indigent
persons
and
he
exerts
his
best
efforts.
i
think
that
we
do
a
great
disjustice
to
the
bar
when
we
say
that
the
bar
is
lazy,
that
the
bar
has
feelings
that
they
want
to
be
amicus.
that
the
bar
has
feelings
of
sloppiness
in
handling
the
record
because
of
the
fact
that
--
and
this
is
pure
supposition,
because
of
the
fact
that
i
think
that
the
basis
of
justice
in
this
country
is
solid
if
and
only
if
we
have
one
thing
and
that
is
a
faith
in
the
integrity
of
the
people
who
are
handling
the
cases
for
the
clients.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
what
i
suggest
in
a
case
like
this
your
honor
is
that
this
court
after
it
determines
just
where
the
position
of
the
american
bar
should
be
when
there
is
no
merit
in
the
brief
that
this
court
then
make
some
promulgation
so
that
the
due
process
standard,
whatever
it
may
be,
and
i
think
that
this
one
certainly
satisfies
it,
that
the
due
process
standard
would
be
equal
throughout
the
united
states.
not
only
in
the
state
courts
but
in
the
federal
courts
as
well,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
take
a
case,
this
particular
case,
and
compare
it
to
a
case
in
a
court
where
they
don't
trust
their
bar
and
they've
said
so
in
one
way
or
another,
and
then
they
take
memorandums
from
the
bar
primarily
to
see
if
the
lawyer
has
done
his
homework.
and
depending
on
the
strength
of
the
memorandum,
they
dismiss
the
case
without
even
looking
at
the
record.
i
think
perhaps
that
at
least,
i
don't
want
to
say
that's
a
bad
standards,
but
i
say
our
standard
is
at
least
as
good
as
that
one
your
honor.
and
i'm
specifically
referring
to
some
of
the
federal
jurisdictions.
now
i
think
one
thing
more
that
i
--
interest
me
greatly,
and
that
is,
what
is
an
appeal?and
i
believe
it's
different
than
a
trial.
trial,
we
say
is
a
search
for
truth
and
an
appeal
is
a
search
for
error.
and
the
appeal
is
something
that's
measurable.
it's
confined
all
around.
it's
got
some
record.
if
it's
not
in
the
record,
you
don't
have
an
appeal.
you
might
have
a
collateral
attack
in
habeas
corpus
or
some
other
matters.
you
do
not
have
an
appeal,
it's
something
that
only
a
trained
person
can
look
at
and
evaluate.
as
i
say
--
said
before,
said
at
my
brief,
we
can't
give
everybody
clarence
darrow,
but
by
the
same
token,
we
give
them
lawyers
who
are
trained,
technical
people.
and
i
don't
think
it
matters
that
the
man
in
the
prison
feels
bad
or
has
some
idea
that
there's
something
wrong
with
his
case.
i
think
his
lawyer
should
consult
with
him
to
find
out
what
he
has
in
mind.
but
he
can
not
evaluate
that
record
unless
he's
the
trained
expert
that
the
lawyer
is.
and
it's
this
mesurement,
and
it's
this
objectivity
to
me
that
distinguishes
regardless
of
what
the
client
says
in
the
prison,
the
error
either
is
or
is
not
in
the
record.
and
if
the
lawyer
looks
and
says,
“there's
no
error”
and
then
the
court
looks
and
does
not
find
any
error,
it
seems
to
me
rather
futile
to
say
that
the
court
should
appoint
another
attorney
to
go
out
and
look
and
see
if
there's
more
error.
and
it's
like
the
old
principle
about
carrying
the
cow
at
the
county
fair.
how
far
do
you
go?
when
do
you
stop?
does
due
process
require
--
due
process
requires
two
lawyers
to
look
then
due
process
requires
20
lawyers
to
look
until
somebody
comes
up
with
some
type
of
an
argument
that
may
or
may
not
carry
any
weight
just
because
of
its
novelty.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
obvious
that
this
matter
would
come
up
--
it
comes
up
to
your
honors
through
a
different
route
too.
and
it
comes
through
habeas
corpus,
for
example,
through
the
federal
courts
or
it
comes
through
direct
certiorari
from
the
appeal
and
the
representation
is
made.
and
i
think
in
those
situations
that
the
court
should
order
a
reference
to
find
out
what
the
true
situation
is
if
it
doesn't
appear
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
of
course
today,
he
can
go
right
directly
to
the
federal
court
immediately
as
i
understand
the
law.
and
he
doesn't
have
to
wait
a
couple
of
years,
and
the
federal
judge
can
make
that
determination.
mr.
george
j.
roth
true.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
--
to
answer
your
honor's
question
in
a
different
way
and
as
many
counsel
have
done
in
the
last
several
days,
that
doesn't
happen
in
california,
that
particular
hypothetical
question.
mr.
george
j.
roth
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
appellate
court
in
its
integrity,
and
i
think
narrower
on
the
level
of
the
integrity
of
the
appellate
court,
that
the
appellate
court
in
its
integrity
will
look
at
that
record,
and
if
it
at
least
--
it
has
to
be
in
the
record
in
order
to
be
raised
in
an
appeal.
and
if
it's
in
the
record,
i
think
the
appellate
court
will
find
it
under
the
california
system
in
the
point
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
i
agree
it's
not.
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
your
honor,
this
would
have
to
appear
in
a
record
however
in
order
to
be
brought
up
on
appeal.
you
--
and
under
our
system
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
this
record
is
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
it
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no.
true,
but
your
honor,
his
record
is
made
by
the
trial
counsel
in
the
trial
court.
and
if
it's
not
made
there
then
his
remedy
is
not
on
appeal,
it's
by
habeas
corpus.
and
i
--
i
saw
at
least
--
as
i
look
at
the
appeals,
the
appeals
are
from
records
and
if
there's
something
outside
the
record,
you
have
to
go
in
a
different
way
and
make
a
different
record.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
think
it
does,
yes.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
think
this
so
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
if
there's
nothing
there,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
i
can
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
whether
there
is
and
i
agree
your
honor.
and
what
is
the
attorney
to
do?
this
is
the
problem
as
i
see
it.
what
is
the
attorney
to
do
who
conscientiously
studies
the
record,
talks
to
his
client?
he
can
be
the
best
attorney
in
town,
he's
got
an
indigent
client
then
he
can't
find
anything.
now
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
with
--
but
it's
a
different
attorney
your
honor
that
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
--
at
the
trial
level
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
the
point
is
your
honor
that
had
there
been
one
there,
we
assume
that
his
trial
lawyer
would've
made
that.
again,
we're
now
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
this
happens
in
many
cases
your
honor,
and
yet
people
still
appeal.
mr.
george
j.
roth
huh?
pardon?
mr.
george
j.
roth
but
he
still
gets
his
appeal
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well
he
has
the
court
look
at
his
record
completely.
that
the
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
and
we
have
to
assume
that
the
courts
have
integrity
when
they
look.
mr.
george
j.
roth
and
if
the
error
is
there,
well,
i
--
just
to
give
you
an
example,
i
saw
one
person,
an
attorney
who
had
a
paying
client,
we're
in
court
and
he
said
to
one
of
my
colleagues,
“my
client
is
an
ex-convict
who
is
charged
with
carrying
a
gun.
do
you
think
that
i
should
just
throw
in
an
argument
that
perhaps
under
the
federal
constitution,
this
impairs
his
right
to
bear
arms?”
and
he
said,
“i've
got
a
paying
client”.
to
have
maybe
might
sound
good,
now
he
knew
this
was
the
type
of
a
point
at
least
that
he
didn't
have
any
faith
in.
and
this
is
the
problem.
what
is
the
attorney
to
do
when
he
looks
at
a
record
and
his
professional
judgment
there
is
nothing
to
argue
about?
now,
this
is
it,
what
does
he
do?
does
he
say
to
the
court,
“gentlemen,
there's
a
statute
that
says
the
judge's
robes
must
be
eight
inches
off
the
floor
and
i
notice
that
one
of
the
judges
had
a
robe
on
that
was
16
inches
off
the
floor”.
you
know,
it's
one
of
these
things
that
it's
a
make
way
to
argument,
or
does
he
say,
“well
my
client
was
questioned
by
the
police
department
ten
years
ago
and
that
questioning
led
to
his
