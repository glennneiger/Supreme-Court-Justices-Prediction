now
mr.
heyman
you
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
these
no-merit
letters
come
obviously
in
the
absence
of
briefs,
but
did
you
say
in
the
absence
of
any
record
before
the
supreme
court?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
made
automatically
in
california
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
copy
provided
to
each
side
and
to
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
that
the
court
does
have
that
record
before
when
it
gets.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
merit
letter?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all
it
has?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
know
that
much
about
the
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
no
more
no
less.
has
the
record
but
no
arguments.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
in
california
is
a
full
record,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
in
--
as
you
know
from
state
to
state,
the
word
record
means
a
variety
of
different
things.
justice
potter
stewart
though
the
transcript
of
the
evidence
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
on
and
everything.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
in
--
under
the
present
practice
that
was
followed
in
this
case
which
was
authorized
by
the
nash
case
in
california,
what
does
happen
after
the
district
court
of
appeal
gets
this
so-called
no-merit
letter
then
what
happens?
then
what
does
the
court
do?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
he
did
file
a
pro
se
brief
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
and
a
reply
brief,
if
i
remember
correctly.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
did
the
court
indicate
what
it
did
in
this
case,
or
has
it
indicated
generally
what
its
practice
is
to
do
in
this
kind
of
a
case?
i'm
not
quite
sure.
do
you
mean
sir,
does
it
make
a
review
of
the
record
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
appoint
an
attorney
or
does
it
make
a
review
of
the
record
to
determine
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
one
attorney
--
one
appointed
attorney
has
been
appointed
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
now
withdrawn
about
--
on
the
--
upon
the
representation
that
he
can't
find
no
merit
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
then
the
court
notifies
the
man
himself,
the
petitioner
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
this
fact
and
gives
him
leave
to
file
a
brief
if
he
wants
to
and
this
petitioner
did
do
so,
and
then
the
state
filed
a
brief
and
then
the
petitioner
field
a
reply
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
i
gather
there
was
no
oral
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
generally
oral
argument
to
the
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
was
no
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
normal
case.
well,
no.
is
there
a
generally
oral
argument
of
an
appeal
on
the
district
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
in
paid
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
or
an
indigent
appeals
when
there's
a
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
so
here
there
was
no
oral
argument
and
the
court
wrote
an
opinion,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
indicate
where,
if
any,
where
it
got
any
additional
help
in
developing
the
issues?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reason
i
asked
is
--
one
reason
i
asked
these
questions,
i
got
the
impression
somewhere
that
the
court
asks
its
lawyers
on
its
staff
or
maybe
lawyers
with
some
bar
association
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
something
to
give
it
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
consists
of
a
panel
of
three
judges?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
one
of
the
three?
justice
potter
stewart
who's
assigned
for
this
particular
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
today's
procedure,
you
include
the
procedure
followed
in
this
case
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
they
asked
his
indigency?
justice
potter
stewart
are
these
volunteers
on
