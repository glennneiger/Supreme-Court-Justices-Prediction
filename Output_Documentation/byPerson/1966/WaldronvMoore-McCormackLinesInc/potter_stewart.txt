justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman,
i
don't
quite
understand
you
when
you
say
this
presents
the
question
for
jury
determination.
in
admiralty,
you're
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
was
--
it
was
joined
with
a
claim
of
negligence?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
jones
act,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
that
and
that's
accepted
but
that's
because
basically
that
the
jones
act
was
joined,
isn't
it,
the
jones
act
cause
of
action?
justice
potter
stewart
you
wouldn't
quarrel,
would
you
or
would
you
that
--
so
that
i
can
be
clear.
if
this
is
an
action
purely
for
maintenance
and
cure,
it's
not
trialed
by
a
jury,
is
that
correct?
exclusively
for
maintenance
and
cure
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
maintenance
and
cure?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
know
there
was
any
common
law
right
as
to
maintenance
and
cure.
i
thought
that
was
purely
an
admiralty
action?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
here
i
understand
you've
got
a
jury
trial
because
you
adjoined
with
your
sea
--
unseaworthiness
claim
and
jones
act
cause
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now,
the
jury
has
determined
that
jones
act
cause
of
action
against
it,
hasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
jones
act
is
simply
basically
incorporates
by
reference
the
fela
and
certainly
there
is
no
right
for
unseaworthiness
against
a
railroad,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
negligence
action?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
negligence
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
common
law
right,
it's
an
admiralty
right,
is
it
not?
well,
in
any
event,
i
think
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
and
i
see
what
the
issues
are.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
this
line?
they
were
on
the
stern
of
the
vessel?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
the
forward
spring
line?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
spring
line?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
how
--
what
kind
of
line
was
this?
justice
potter
stewart
8-inch
line?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wasn't
the
weight
of
the
line
--
it
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
slipped
in
the
deck,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
asking
for
information.
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
resistance
of
the
line
though,
not
that
weight
of
the
line,
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
one-inch
line
would
have
the
same
resistance
to
175-pound
man,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he
couldn't
the
break
line.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
general
question
that's
been
decided.
yes,
there
is.
the
mitchell
case
decides
that
i
should
suppose
and
other
cases.
but
this
is
not
quite
that
broad
question,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
those
aren't
regulations
in
addition
to
specifying
numbers
of
men,
also
specifies
their
minimum
proficiency
required,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
these
were
what,
able-bodied?
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
at
the
stern,
this
group
was
a
mate
and
what,
a
mate
and
a
boatswain
and
three
others?
justice
potter
stewart
one
ordinary.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
sort
of
a
sea-going
cassius
clay?
