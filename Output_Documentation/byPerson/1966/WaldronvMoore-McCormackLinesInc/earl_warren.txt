chief

well,
isn't
that
somewhat
different
from
this
case
in
that
that
was
faulty
equipment.
and
in
this
case,
there
was
no
faulty
equipment.
it
was
merely
the
faulty
manner
in
which
the
work
was
called
upon
to
be
done.
chief

you

mr.

chief

do
you
cite
that
as
authority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
if
--
i
wonder
if
all
of
the
members
of
the
crew
were
diligently
engaged
in
other
pursuits
at
the
moment
and
there
were
not
enough
available
men
to
do
this
in
a
proper
manner.
would
it
necessary
follow
that
this
crew
is
adequate?
this
was
not
an
emergency,
not
a
turbulent
sea,
not
anything
out
of
the
ordinary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
had
sent
one
man,
would
that
have
been
--
would
you
have
a
different
case
here?
chief

earl
warren
what
negligence
for
unseaworthiness
would
you
have
a
different
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
--
let's
carry
it
just
one
step
further
to

might
be
too
absurdly,
but
suppose
that
a
mate
said,
“do
it
yourself”,
and
sent
no
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
then
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
he
wanted
to
--
well,
suppose
he
tried,
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
done
but
suppose
he
tried
and
in
trying
that
he
got
hurt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
suppose
this
man
was
--
supposed
to
--
it
was
misery
for
some
members
of
the
crew
to
do
this
task
that
was
involved
here.
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case
asked
the
mate
for
assistance
in
doing
it,
but
he
said,
“oh,
do
it
yourself,
you
can
do
it”,
and
he
then
did
it
himself
and
got
hurt.
chief
justice
earl

yes.

mr.
friedman.
chief

may
i
ask
this
question
mr.
friedman,
suppose
the
mate
had
sent
four
men
who
had
good
qualifications
for
this
kind
of

on
this
particular
occasion,
one
of
the

who
was
with

to
do
some

act,
would
the
