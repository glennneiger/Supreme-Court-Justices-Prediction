justice

black
may
i
ask
you
--
is
it
your
argument
that
a
shipowner
can
be
liable
for
negligence
from
the
failure
to
have
adequate
number
of
persons
to
do
a
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
it
cannot
be
found
guilty
of
unseaworthiness
for
an
adequate
number
of
people
to
do
the
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
really
the
argument
they
--
that
they're
never
be
allowed
for
unseaworthiness
for
having
an
inadequate
number
of
people
to
do
the
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
your
argument
is,
is
that
if
the
coast
guard
rules
are
complied
with
then
ship
can
never
be
unseaworthy?
justice
hugo
l.

why
is
that?

three
or
four

three
of
those

were
out
of

would
that
be
unseaworthiness?
justice

right.

the

three
of

what
you're

what
you're

that

mechanical

this
particular
part

a
certain
number
of

needed
