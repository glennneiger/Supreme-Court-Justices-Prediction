justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
want
us
to
review
this
case
on
that
basis,
that
the
--
this
is
--
was
indeed
an
unsafe
situation
in
the
sense
that
four
men
instead
of
two
should've
been
carrying
the
line,
that's
the
basis
on
which
you
say
we
must
review
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
were
true
and
the
jury
believed
that
if
you
--
if
--
i
would've
--
i
would
assume
that
if
--
would've
found
negligence
in
giving
the
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
seems
to
me
that
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
--
you
can
give
a
non-negligent
order
even
though
it's
an
order
which
puts
two
men
in
a
--
unsafe
condition?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
that
if
--
are
you
saying
that
that's
a
sensible
that
--
it's
just
sensible
to
believe,
to
think
the
jury
--
have
thought
that
is
--
that
they
thought
the
other.
it
seems
to
me
it's
more
sensible
for
the
jury
to
have
believed
that
it
was
a
safe
condition.
there
was
testimony
to
the
contrary
that
it
is
unsafe
that
the
jury
didn't
need
to
make
that
safe
--
not
to
make
that
assumption
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
jury
couldn't
find
negligence,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
i'm
just
suggesting
--
i'm
just
asking
--
want
to
know
why
--
even
if
you
were
right
on
the
point
that
you
won
in
this
case,
you
would
still
lose
if
there
was
no
unseaworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
lose
and
that
the
only
was
you
could
win
is
on
the
assumption
that
there's
unseaworthiness,
that
there
was
an
unsafe
condition.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
maybe
the
jury
didn't
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
the
jury
here
has
found
negligence
at
the
end,
and
would
you
say
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would've
been
--
and
it's
based
on
the
facts,
they
shouldn't
have
ordered
two
men
to
do
this
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
there
maybe
but
don't
you
then
face
the
hazard
of
steering
--
of
steering
this
line
in
any
case
anyway
of
assigning
too
few
or
too
many,
if
i
were
to
be
found
to
be
negligent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
whatever,
extra
hazard,
this
is
on
unseaworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
the
mate
orders
two
seamen
to
carry
this
--
with
this
rope
on
a
dolly
and
the
example
that
you
have
put
in
this
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
dolly
breaks
down
and
hurts
one
of
them
--
hurts
one
of
the
men
that
it's
just
--
and
it
was
found
that
the
dolly
wasn't
strong
enough
to
carry
the
rope.
now,
i
suppose
there's
unseaworthiness
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
instead
of
telling
the
two
fellows
to
take
the
dolly
and
the
dolly's
breaking,
he
just
sends
the
two
men
and
one
of
the
men
breaks,
that's
not
unseaworthy?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
that
mr.
friedman,
what's
left
is
outside
the
concept
of
unseaworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
unseaworthiness.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
just
ask
you
a
specific
question
to
that
effect
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
it
was
too
broad.
how
about
this
ordinary
negligence,
ordinary
negligence
of
the
ship's
officer
or
a
seaman?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
is
not
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
of
an
accident
is
unseaworthiness?
i
don't
see
why
see
this
--
the
ordinary
negligence
of
a
ship's
officers
isn't
unseaworthiness
too.
i
mean,
may
not
