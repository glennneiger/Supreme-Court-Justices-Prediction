you
put

it
ultimately
comes
down,

it
not
we
assume
no
negligence,
adequate
new
staff
crew
both
overall

for
the
particular
part
of
the
ship
that's
involved

your
proposition
does
ultimately
come
down
to
say
that
the
shipowner
is
an
underwriter
of
the
kind
of
the
decision
in
the

finding
negligence
would
