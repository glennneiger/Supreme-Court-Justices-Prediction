mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
may
it
please
the
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court.
this
maritime
action
arises
in
grant
a
certiorari
from
the
second
circuit
following
a
trial
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
during
the
course
of
which
or
at
the
close
of
which,
after
all
the
evidence
was
in,
the
trial
court
determined
to
dismiss
a
portion
of
the
seaman's
claim
and
to
refuse
to
permit
the
jury
to
pass
upon
it.
and
that
specific
claim
is
what
is
before
the
court
now,
and
that
is
whether
the
fact
as
was
demonstrated
by
fact
testimony
and
expert
testimony
that
there
were
an
insufficient
number
of
men
provided
for
a
particular
test
aboard
the
ship
at
the
particular
time
and
place
the
job
function
was
to
be
carried
out
was
within
the
reach
and
doctrine
scope
of
the
concept
of
unseaworthiness.
the
second
circuit
divided
two
to
one
on
the
matter.
indeed,
the
trial
court
had
himself
change
his
mind
during
the
course
of
the
case,
having
first
decided
it
in
favor
of
the
seaman
and
this
court
of
course
has
granted
certiorari.
now
the
issue
as
presented
might
be
deemed
noble
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
not
specifically
passed
upon
it
in
the
sense
of
manpower
insufficiency
creating
unseaworthiness
or
at
least
a
jury
question
for
resolution.
but
this
court
has
of
course
on
numerous
occasions
stated
quite
clearly
that
any
insufficiency
of
equipment,
the
pertinences
or
appliances
for
a
particular
task
at
the
time
and
place
the
task
is
performed
aboard
the
ship
gives
rise
to
a
condition
of
unseaworthiness,
at
the
very
least,
creates
a
question
for
jury
resolution.
and
of
course,
this
court's
historic
and
landmark
position
in
mitchell
v.
trawler
racer
enunciated
more
clearly
than
ever
before
that
the
doctrines
and
concepts
and
concerns
of
negligence
law
were
to
be
completely
eliminated
from
any
determination
of
unseaworthiness
liability.
of
course,
that
was
again
reiterated
in
the
gutierrez
opinion
and
in
the
reed
opinion
of
some
three
terms
ago.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
your
honor,
this
was
tried
before
a
jury,
it
was
tried
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
on
the
civil
side.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
your
honor,
that
takes
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
and
no
your
honor.
i
say
no
because
in
the
fitzgerald
case,
when
the
maintenance
and
cure
was
joined
with
the
unseaworthiness
and
the
jones
act
claim,
it
was
held
by
this
court,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black,
i
had
the
pleasure
of
arguing
the
case,
that
the
matter
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
all
maritime
matters
arising
out
of
the
same
accident
where
the
proceeding
on
the
theory
of
negligence
under
the
jones
act
unseaworthiness
on
the
general
maritime
law
or
even
if
maintenance
and
cure
with
its
different
concepts
of
damages
were
all
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes
i
would
say
that,
yes
and
no
in
this
instance
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
right,
assuming
no
diversity
of
citizenship,
it
would
be
purely
an
admiralty
if
brought
in
the
federal
court
because
it
could
be
brought
under
the
common
law
in
the
state
court
where
you
would
get
a
jury
and
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
it
regularly
occurs.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
we
had
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
that
was
discussed
if
i
may
say
in
the
fitzgerald
briefs,
but
i
think
the
law
is
to
that
effect.
i
recall
distinctly
in
the
court.
but
regardless
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
the
question
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
that's
correct.
well,
it
has
determined
the
negligence
claim
against
it.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
if
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
splitting
heads
your
honor
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
this
problem
has
given
very
careful
--
has
given
rise,
it's
a
very
careful
thought.
let
me
say
this.
in
the
bartholomew,
the
universe
tankships
case
decided
by
the
second
circuit,
it
was
a
concurring
and
lengthy
and
scholarly
opinion
by
chief
judge
lumbard,
the
second
circuit
in
which
he
point
--
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
an
unseaworthiness
claim
is
not
within
the
jones
act
that
the
reach
and
intention
of
the
jones
act
was
not
nearly
negligence
but
to
also
incorporate
a
claim
based
solely
on
unseaworthiness
and
therefore
even
a
purely
unseaworthiness
claim
would
give
rise
to
the
jury
rights
established
by
the
jones
act.
now
that
was
the
concurring
opinion
that
scholarly
--
in
a
scholarly
fashion
raised
questions,
it
has
never
been
resolved.
to
a
certain
extent,
it
was
before
this
court
in
romero.
to
a
certain
extent,
i
urge
that
it
has
no
alternative
grounds
of
deciding
the
fitzgerald
case,
the
court
didn't
feel
necessary.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
that
is
correct,
but
it
--
in
that
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
right.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
which
chief
judge
lumbard
raised
the
question
your
honor
was
whether
the
jones
act
doesn't
in
fact
incorporate
the
common
law
rights
of
those
men
who
worked
in
the
manner
that
they
worked.
and
since
of
course
railroad
workers
do
not
work
at
sea,
they
didn't
have
those
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
common
law
rights
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it's
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes.
that
--
that's
a
separate
problem,
of
course
if
i
may
answer
this
specifically
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
the
question
that
is
involved
is
whether
assuming
that
we're
entitled
to
our
trial,
do
we
go
back
to
a
trial
by
jury
or
a
trial
without
a
jury.
then,
i
answer
this
way
if
i
may
and
perhaps
prematurely,
but
nevertheless,
that
the
trial
must
be
by
jury,
a
separate
question
on
what
must
be
decided
by
this
court
at
this
time
i
would
submit,
because
the
law
is
clear
that
where
there
are
related
and
intertwined
actions
based
--
which
due
give
rise
to
a
jury
rights
such
as
the
pending
jurisdiction
cases.
and
the
case
upon
which
jurisdiction
and
jury
right
originally
was
based,
falls
by
the
wayside,
not
even
by
trial
but
even
earlier,
by
motion.
the
line
of
cases
which
we
did
not
brief
because
we
did
not
realized
that
question
will
be
presented
--
decided,
state
that
the
trial
by
jury
and
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
on
the
civil
side
continues.
it
is
only
if
the
action
which
gave
basis
to
the
civil
court
federal
jurisdiction
has
been
found
to
be
without
color
and
merely
presented
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
the
jurisdiction
that
the
pending
case
lose
its
all
--
loses
all
its
status
to
be
decided
as
it
would
be
if
the
other
actions
didn't
fall.
that
i
submit
is
my
understanding
of
that
area.
in
any
case,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
specific
question
of
unseaworthiness,
whether
it
gives
rise
to
a
question
for
jury
resolution
or
i
might
argue
and
certainly
willing
to
argue
that
it
gives
rise
to
an
issue
of
law
that
unquestionably,
the
facts
were
found
as
we
submit
them,
unseaworthiness
did
exist.
now
i
can
see
that
here
there
was
a
dispute.
an
expert
testimony
--
tried,
others
testified
and
said
--
we
said
that
there
was
unseaworthiness
that
there
was
a
regular
custom
and
practice
and
need
for
three
to
four
men
to
perform
this
job.
that
fact
issue
was
disputed
by
the
defendants
who
said,
every
right
to
do.
but
we
submit
that
that
fact
issue
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
and
had
the
jury
found
that
three
or
four
men
were
required
to
the
performance
of
this
particular
task,
then
the
jury
should
have
been
struck
--
instructed
and
on
those
grounds
they
could
return
a
verdict
to
the
indigent
seaman.
now
the
defendant's
position
was
that
we
prove
that
the
shipowner
that
there
were
a
sufficient
number
of
men
overall
aboard
the
ship.
we
prove
that
the
coast
guard
had
issued
a
certificate
of
inspection
that
required
a
certain
number
of
able
bodied
seamen
and
ordinary
seamen
to
be
aboard
the
ship,
some
12
or
15
as
the
--
that
portion
of
the
deck
crew,
and
that
we
had
now
those
number
of
men
aboard
the
ship.
therefore,
regardless
of
the
proof
and
fact
that
at
a
particular
time
and
place,
at
1:30
in
the
afternoon
on
may
8,
1960
as
the
ship
was
docking
at
this
brooklyn
pier,
only
two
men
were
assigned
for
a
particular
task,
and
regardless
of
the
facts
that
there
was
adequate
proof
that
two
men
were
not
sufficient.
when
i
say
adequate,
i
mean
adequate
at
least
to
go
to
jury.
then,
the
matter
must
be
dismissed
as
a
matter
of
law
because
we
had
these
other
13
to
15
men
aboard
the
ship.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
totally
contrary
to
the
clear
position
that
this
court
stated
in
the
mahnich
decision,
mahnich
v.
southern
steamship
companies,
from
1944,
where
it
said
explicitly,
that
the
fact
that
there
were
sufficient
equipment
aboard
the
vessel,
sufficient
and
proper,
does
not
mean
that
the
ship
cannot
be
found
unseaworthy
if
at
the
particular
time
and
place
that
the
job
function
is
carried
out
there
is
a
defect
or
inadequacy.
in
the
mahnich
case,
there
was
some
rope
lying
in
the
bin,
the
officer
just
as
here,
there
was
a
mate,
the
mate
reached
into
the
bin
and
pulled
out
some
rope
and
its
--
was
set
up
for
staging
to
hold
a
certain
weight,
certain
staging.it
turned
out
that
that
rope
had
a
latent
defect.
the
mate
was
is
no
way
negligent
in
selecting
that
rope.
he
could
not
know
that
it
had
a
latent
defect
hidden
within
it.
the
staging
collapsed
and
the
seaman
was
injured.
it
was
clearly
stated
by
this
case
--
by
this
court
that
although
there
was
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
mate
and
although
there
need
be
found
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
mate,
and
although
the
defect
was
completely
latent
and
hidden,
the
fact
that
there
was
this
insufficiency
of
the
rope
gave
rise
to
condition
of
unseaworthiness.
and
further,
this
court
stated
that
although
the
--
there
was
proven
to
be
a
sufficient
amount
of
safe
and
proper
and
non-defective
rope
aboard
this
very
ship
and
so
that
the
shipowner
had
indeed
equipped
the
ship
with
sufficient
proper
rope,
had
sent
it
out
on
the
seas
with
sufficient
and
proper
rope,
in
no
way
but
the
claim
of
unseaworthiness
because
at
the
particular
time
and
place
the
job
function
was
carried
out,
improper,
insufficient,
inadequate
rope
was
in
fact
used
giving
rise
to
the
injury.
now
the
only
question
as
i
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
your
honor,
the
distinction
is
this,
that
in
this
case
in
our
waldron
case,
the
work
to
be
performed
involved
manpower,
what
was
holding
up
the
load,
what
was
pulling
the
weight
and
withstanding
the
forces
of
gravity
and
its
inertia,
were
not
here
a
rope
as
in
mahnich,
but
was
men's
backs.
so
manpower
in
a
primitive
way
because
no
machinery
could
here
do
that
job
were
being
used
where
men
were
used
in
mahnich
and
that
was
the
--
that
that's
the
difference,
but
other
than
that
that,
there
is
no
difference.
now,
there
are
enumerable
occasions
aboard
ship
and
not
on
board
ship
when
men
must
simply
do
the
work.
automation
has
not
yet
completely
taken
place
aboard
ship
or
elsewhere.
and
the
question
is
whether
when
men
are
used
instead
of
machines
or
equipment.
does
the
protection
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
end?
does
mahnich
not
reached
where
men's
back
instead
of
manufactured
equipment
are
being
used?
and
i
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
in
law
or
logic
or
sense
of
justice
for
any
such
line
to
be
drawn
and
there
is
no
indicated
case
by
this
court
that
suggests
any
such
arbitrary
cutoff
of
the
beneficial
doctrine.
this
court
has
frequently
pointed
out
that
the
reason
for
this
doctrine
is
that
men
go
out
on
the
seas
and
are
exposed
to
certain
kinds
of
routine
hazards
that
do
occur
aboard
ship.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
hurricane
and
the
perils
and
the
unusual
storm
of
the
sea
that
mr.
justice
stewart
--
i
would
think
had
in
mind
when
he's
pointed
out
in
mitchell
for
this
court
that
the
ship
need
not
whether
every
peril
and
every
storm
to
be
deemed
seaworthy.
there
maybe
occasions.
but
this
is
not
such
an
unusual
or
particularly
a
strange
circumstance,
the
fact
that
men
will
have
to
hold
ropes
or
lines
or
weights
aboard
a
ship
is
one
of
the
most
common
occurrences
aboard
the
ship.
the
ship
is
that
--
i'm
sure
this
court
is
familiar,
has
many
narrow
areas,
many
stairways,
many
places
and
times
when
men's
backs
must
do
the
physical
labor
and
be
exposed
to
certain
hazards
that
can
occur.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
taking
that
in
mind,
the
awkward
situation
where
eight
men
are
told
to
grab
a
small
item
and
they're
sort
of
nudging
each
other
in
going
down
the
stairway
and
that
gives
rise
to
an
accident.
i
would
not
hesitate
to
say
your
honor
that
that
too
would
create
a
type
of
dangerous
condition
that
would
involve
an
unseaworthy
and
unsafe
condition.
i
don't
know
if
the
resolution
of
that
question
hinges
upon
this
question
because
here,
there's
an
unquestioned
insufficiency.
again,
when
i
say
unquestioned,
i
mean
that
the
plaintiff's
prima
facie
evidence
established
that,
entitling
him
to
have
that
dispute
resolved
by
the
jury
or
by
the
trier
of
fact,
whoever
that
will
ultimately
be.
but
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
an
insufficiency.
captain
darigan
(ph),
the
expert
with
some
50
years
of
experience
stated
flatly
that
this
job
needed
three
to
four
men
and
there
were
only
two
and
that's
an
unquestioned
--
undisputed
gap
in
--
i
mean,
difference
in
the
testimony.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
they
were
on
the
stern
of
the
vessel
and
what
occurred
here
your
honor
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
don't
know
if
--
what
--
yes,
forward
of
the
stern
area.
what
happened
was
that
they
were
coming
into
a
new
pier
in
brooklyn
that
had
not
been
much
used.
and
suddenly
there
came
an
order
to
the
third
mate
relayed
in
the
intra-communication
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
system
to
get
a
line
out
at
this
forward
chuck.
when
i
say
forward,
it's
sort
of
halfway
towards
mid-ships
and
the
stern
area.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it
was
a
spring
line.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
suddenly
he
said,
“will
you
two
fellows
go
up
and
put
out
that
line”.
and
that
was
unusual,
that
was
different
in
the
usual
routine.
and
so
the
third
mate
said,
“i
wasn't
negligent
in
responding
to
the
situation,
in
responding
to
the
order”.
and
he
certainly
had
a
strong
in
the
jury's
sympathetic
imposition
to
maintain
that
why
should
he
personally
with
what
the
--
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
was
involved,
why
should
he
personally
be
charged
of
being
negligent
in
sending
these
men
up
to
do
it.
but
the
point
was
that
the
result
was
that
two
men
were
lugging
and
dealing
on
a
steel
misty
deck
of
weight
that
involved
according
to
the
testimony
or
should
have
involved
three
to
four
men.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it
was
a
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it
was
an
8-inch
manila
line.
there
was
some
56
feet
from
the
place
where
it
was
coiled
to
the
forward
chuck
where
it
was
to
be
laid
out
and
they
were
of
course
working
as
diligently
and
urgently
as
possible
on
--
which
--
was
what
--
was
required
to
be
done.
and
it
was
a
--
there
was
some
mist
on
the
air
and
they
were
moving
as
fast
as
they
could
and
one
of
the
men
hauling
it
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
he
slipped,
as
he
was
falling
backwards.
the
testimony
was,
using
this
--
with
this
weight
on
him,
he
went
out
from
under
and
he
hurt
his
back.
the
medical
group
wasn't
as
highly
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
it
was
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
no,
i
mean
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
the
--
he
slipped
on
the
deck
but
not
because
the
deck
was
in
itself
slippery.
there
was
a
contention
that
the
deck
was
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
the
weight
of
the
line
gave
rise
to
a
certain
resistance,
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
a
four-inch
line
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
because
there
wasn't
any
tension
in
the
sense
the
line
wasn't
being
held
back
by
any
kind
of
spring.
it
was
coiled
on
a
56-feet
--
they
lifted
sections
of
it.
they
lifted
up
the
line
and
went
up
the
deck
with
it
on
their
backs.
and
so
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
made
a
difference
whether
it
was
eight-inch
or
four-inch
line,
but
regardless,
all
of
those
facts
presented
to
captain
darigan
(ph)
and
the
expert
was
sufficient
for
him
to
--
or
to
his
opinion,
that
the
line
required
this
particular
functions,
particular
job
functions
required
three
to
four
men
for
its
safe
performance
and
there
was
a
dispute
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
one
might
have
thought
so
in
the
sense
that
it
would
make
an
appealing
jury
argument.
but
on
the
counter
argument
was
the
third
mate,
mr.
tarantino
who
came
by
way
of
deposition
but
in
any
case
the
evidence
was,
he
said
i
wasn't
negligent.
i
was
responding
to
the
immediate
situation.
i
had
only
five
men
back
at
the
stern
area
with
me.
the
other
three
men
were
diligently
putting
lines
out
to
the
stern
area
itself.
when
i
gave
two
men
in
response
to
this
that
was
the
most
i
could
do
in
the
circumstances,
why
should
i
be
penalized
by
the
owners
who
are
being
denominated
as
negligent
in
the
situation
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
and
that
argument,
one-jury
appealed.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
not
have
begun
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
had
the
jury
rendered
a
defendant's
verdict
on
all
of
the
claims
that
should've
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
it
was
an
issue
for
the
jury
to
decide.
but
the
jury
didn't
get
the
opportunity
to
decide
it.
i
submit
that
it
was
a
proper
argument
to
make
to
the
jury
that
in
the
circumstances,
mate
tarantino
was
not
negligent.
he
was
performing
his
work
as
carefully
and
as
reasonably
as
a
man
could
do
under
the
circumstances
but
nevertheless
an
unsafe
condition
did
arise
and
these
men
were
exposed
to
danger
and
should
be
compensated
on
the
very
point
of
difference
that
the
mitchell
case,
the
reed
case
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
no.
and
that
is
what
this
case
is,
i
respectfully
submit,
all
about.
is
there
an
area
of
liability
where
there
is
not
negligence
within
the
concept
in
reach
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness.
and
i
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
what
this
case
does
is
focus
on
the
question
as
to
whether
that
broad
doctrine
enunciated
in
mitchell
and
as
i
submit,
enunciated
in
mahnich
which
as
this
--
as
your
honor
pointed
out
was
a
leading
landmark
case
to
be
continued
--
to
be
followed,
is
focused
on
the
insufficiency
of
manpower,
is
there
to
be
a
division,
a
change
because
what
is
insufficiently
provided
is
manpower
as
distinct
from
equipment.
if
i
may
say
mr.
justice
white,
the
same
argument,
the
same
problem
could
arise
if
what
was
not
provided
to
the
seaman
doing
the
job
was
a
piece
of
machinery
or
equipment
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
to
help
him.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
if
there
were
no
unseaworthiness,
i
would
lose.
there
is
no
negligence
and
there
is
no
unseaworthiness
and
there
has
to
be
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
a
defendant's
verdict.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
but
--
the
jury
didn't
think
there
was
negligence.
the
jury
was
not
presented,
given
opportunity
to
decide
the
question.
what
i
want
this
court
respectfully
to
do
is
to
let
me
go
back
and
submit
that
question
to
a
jury
or
if
a
further
research
that
indicates
with
admiralty
judge,
and
have
them
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
there
was
unseaworthiness.
this
was
a
premature
judicial
dismissal
of
a
claim
that
should've
been
submitted
to
a
jury
under
a
host
of
cases
that
had
been
decided
by
this
court
particularly
dealing
with
seamen's
claims
injured
during
their
employment.
now,
i
want
to
refer
very
respectfully
and
very
briefly
to
the
coast
guard
manning
regulations
that
are
referred
to
by
my
adversary's
brief.
there
was
--
i
think
i
referred
to
it
before
coast
guard
certificate,
i
think
i've
already
indicated
that
these
coast
guard
certificates
do
not
pretend
to
lay
down
the
number
of
men
that
have
to
be
employed
on
a
particular
job.
there
are
--
one
certificate
that
are
posted
somewhere
a
mid-ship
to
say
the
ship
shall
have
12
able-bodied
seamen
and
eight
ordinary
seamen,
period.
how
many
men
should
be
on
the
rear
gang
and
how
many
men
should
be
mid-ship
and
how
many
men
shall
deal
with
a
particular
rope,
the
coast
guard
doesn't
begin
to
attempt
to
deal
with
and
obviously,
if
the
mere
fact
that
the
coast
guard
certificate
has
been
met,
you
could
split
all
the
men
on
vacation,
have
one
man
do
all
the
jobs
and
say
that
there
could
be
no
unseaworthiness
for
insufficient
manning.
the
insufficient
manning
per
se
is
unquestionably
been
recognized
as
the
grounds
for
unseaworthiness.
we
have
only
to
this
--
to
reach
the
question
in
this
court
i
respectfully
submit,
as
to
whether
the
insufficient
manning
where
the
ship
to
leave
the
port
without
sufficient
number
of
men
is
also
to
be
found
as
imposing
liability
when
the
condition
arises
temporarily
during
the
course
of
the
work
while
the
ship
was
on
the
high
seas.
and
again,
i
submit,
this
court
held
in
mitchell
and
is
held
time
and
time
again
that
the
fact
that
the
condition
is
a
temporary
one
and
arises
only
during
the
course
of
the
trip
rather
than
at
the
inception
when
the
ship
leaves
the
port
certainly
does
not
excuse
or
exonerate
the
shipowner
from
liability.
indeed
i
may
say
because,
mr.
justice
medina's
--
excuse
judge
medina's
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
gave
some
passing
reference
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
decision
in
the
dickson
against
united
states
written
on
the
second
circuit,
in
which
as
i
recall
it,
the
opinion
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
the
fact
that
the
ship's
unseaworthiness
condition
arises
while
the
ship
is
on
the
high
seas
as
distinct
when
the
ship
leaves
the
port
might
therefore
not
give
rise
to
unseaworthiness
liability.
and
i
think
that
the
opinion
below
attempts
to
give
continued
application
to
that
distinction
when
i
think
this
court
in
mitchell
very
explicitly
stated
that
the
facts
and
the
conditions
is
temporary
and
the
fact
that
the
condition
arises
when
the
ship
is
on
the
high
seas
as
distinct
from
before
it
leaves
the
port
does
not
exonerate
and
excuse
the
shipowner.
and
so
i
think
that
what
happened
below
was
that
an
application
of
the
doctrine
that
has
already
in
mitchell
been
laid
to
rest
by
this
court
was
sought
to
be
imposed
on
one
fragmentary
area,
where
the
insufficiency
of
manpower
as
distinct
from
equipment.
and
i
think
i've
already
spoke
into
that
point
as
to
the
facts
that
there
is
an
absolute
equivalence.
this
court
has
pointed
out
there's
an
absolute
equivalence
in
the
boudoin
and
other
cases
between
insufficiency
of
personnel
and
insufficiency
equipment
obviously
in
the
regular
course
of
work
aboard
the
ship,
men
are
sometimes
called
upon
to
do
that
which
machinery
cannot
do
and
there
should
be
no
sharp
or
strange
or
unsupported
division
between
the
liabilities
that
should
be
imposed.
and
i
would
respectfully
with
the
court's
permission
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
with
the
courts
permission,
i
would
like
to
speak
directly
to
the
question
of
the
coast
guard
regulations
that
have
been
so
heavily
relied
upon.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
contains
testimony
on
page
8,
by
the
petitioner
seaman
himself
that
the
job
as
a
matter
of
regular
custom,
this
particular
job
involved
a
minimum
of
three
men.
and
one
man
had
to
be
at
the
chuck.
now,
your
honor,
the
spring
line,
the
line
is
going
out,
there's
a
tremendous
amount
of
tension
and
pressure
on
it.
it
is
a
heavy
line.
one
man
would
be
at
the
chuck
letting
the
line
out
in
controlling
it
otherwise
it
can
become
literally
a
snake
aboard
the
vessel
and
cause
all
kinds
of
injury.
and
two
men
must
slog
it
and
that
is
right
on
page
8.
now,
i
advert
to
that
particularly
because
there
is
this
reference
that
it
was
--
and
this
without
regard,
it
will
happen
to
be
an
unusual
chuck
to
use
anywhere
that
such
a
spring
line
is
being
led
out,
be
it
a
chuck
a
little
farther
forward
or
a
little
farther
back,
it
involves
those
number
of
men,
so
testified
by
the
petitioner.
now,
there
is
adversion
to
the
fact
that
they
were
--
it
was
conceded
that
five
men
was
the
usual
aft
gang
docking
crew
and
five
men
were
there
provided.
that's
true.
but
it
was
also
testified
if
you
want
to
split
it
down,
that
usually
three
men
at
least
will
provide
it
before
we
even
got
to
the
expert
testimony
for
this
particular
kind
of
operation
and
that
was
not
met
according
to
the
petitioner's
testimony
in
this
case.
my
learned
friend
says,
all
of
this
is
irrelevant
provided
there
were
15
abs
and
12
oss
aboard
the
ship
if
that
what
the
coast
guard
certificate
posted
in
mid
ships
required.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
he
has
not
been
able
to
and
i've
not
been
able
to
find
a
single
iota
of
authority
that
suggest
that
that
type
of
compliance
with
the
overall
coast
guard
regulations
will
suffice
to
deal
with
a
job
as
it
is
performed
at
the
particular
time
and
place.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
the
instruction
would
be
that
in
the
event
the
jury
believed
that
the
safe
performance
of
this
work
required
the
use
of
three
to
four
men
because
of
the
load
and
the
tension
and
the
manner
in
which
this
rope
and
line
had
to
be
handled,
and
in
fact
they
find
that
less
than
three
men
were
used.
and
they
find
that
such
failure
to
provide
three
men
and
the
use
of
only
two
men
contributed
to
causing
the
injuries
complained
of
that
they
may
find
that
the
vessel,
the
shipowner
is
responsible
in
damages
to
the
seaman
injured
during
the
course
of
his
employment.
and
that
your
honor
is
precisely
as
i
see
it
what
seaworthiness
liability
is
all
about.
the
risks
and
the
hazards
of
the
maritime
employment
ought
to
be
protected
and
accepted
and
compensated
by
the
shipowner
because
of
the
standard
concepts
of
risk
sharing
and
risk
distribution
that
have
been
enunciated
and
described
by
this
court
in
seas
shipping
co.
v.
sieracki
and
again
by
mr.
justice
black
recently
in
the
reed
v.
yaka
case
and
down
through
the
agents.
and
that
is
the
social
outlook
that
this
court
has
enunciated
and
there
has
been
no
reason
presented
as
i
can
see
it
for
why
this
case
should
be
lifted
out
where
the
seaman
is
injured
doing
the
ordinary
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
course
of
his
employment.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
if
a
seaman
is
in
fact
injured
and
we
have
to
start
with
that.
he's
injured
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
during
the
course
of
his
employment,
he's
an
injured
man.
if
in
fact
the
reason
that
he
is
injured
is
that
he
was
injected
into
an
unsafe
condition
because
of
the
performance
of
his
work
and
if
that
unsafe
condition
arose
out
of
the
fact
that
a
shipowner
did
not
provide
him
with
sufficient
support,
be
it
physical,
equipment,
or
manpower,
then
indeed
your
honor,
i
read
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
i
may
answer,
i
focused
on
that
part
of
your
question
which
said,
assuming
a
crew
adequate
for
the
particular
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
part
of
the
ship,
because
i
do
not
find
and
i
submit
the
petitioner's
testimony
was
that
the
crew
provided
was
not
adequate
for
the
particular
job
being
performed.
there
were
five
men
back
in
the
rear
of
the
ship
but
there
weren't
enough
men
doing
this
particular
job
and
as
i
said
in
the
outset
and
i
will
close
with
it,
managed
to
my
mind,
so
completely
disposes
of
that
concept
that
if
at
the
particular
performance
of
the
job
function,
sufficient
assistance
is
not
provided
and
a
seaman
is
injured
in
the
manner
which
i've
stated,
then
he
is
to
be
cared
for
by
the
shipping
company
which
can
distribute
the
rest
more
ably
than
the
individuals.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
what
is
now
left
outside
the
concepts
of
seaworthiness?
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
your
honor,
that
concept
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
alright.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
if
a
seaman
is
injured
as
a
result
of
a
ship
officer's
negligence,
the
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
right
to
recover
is
not
within
dispute.
your
honor
i
believe
is
asking
me
when
--
what
kind
of
accident
can
occur
aboard
the
ship
that
he
is
not
entitled
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
what
happened
is
that
sometimes
the
instrument
of
injury
does
not
involve
any
negligent
act
on
the
part
of
the
ship's
officers
and
yet
the
man
is
injured
and
an
unsafe
condition
is
created
as
indeed
the
facts
that's
that
i've
described
within
mahnich
with
the
rope,
the
latent
defect
rope
was
unwittingly
taken
out
of
the
bin
or
in
the
circumstances
here
involved
and
yet
the
seaman
is
injured
and
should
be
compensated
because
of
an
insufficiency
aboard
the
ship.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
to
extend
on
that,
i
would
say
yes
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
let's
assume
just
that
happens
and
a
sufficient
number
of
men
are
sent
forth.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
let's
assume
that
suddenly
one
men
has
some
kind
of
convulsion
or
stroke
and
he
collapses
on
the
job,
he's
been
sent
by
the
mate
and
he
collapses
on
the
job,
in
fact
to
extend
it
if
i
may,
let's
assume
that
he
only
sent
three,
so
the
one
man
who
collapses
now
leaves
the
condition
that
originally
occurred
here
of
two,
and
the
two
men
continuing
with
the
job,
being
insufficient,
the
accident
occurs.
i
respectfully
submit
that
while
that's
not
this
case,
that
fact
is
that
the
other
two
men
are
remained
exposed
to
the
insufficiency
of
support
of
the
accident
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
negligence
liability
and
unseaworthiness
liability.
assume
if
your
honor
made
--
if
i
may
say,
that
what
they
gave
was
three
ropes
to
support
a
staging,
or
four
ropes,
and
one
rope
collapses
because
it's
a
latent
defect
and
the
man
is
injured,
certainly
no
one
would
suggest,
“well,
you
had
two
other
good
ropes
or
we
did
originally
provide
you
with
three.”
if
one
breaks
down
either
during
the
job
because
its
defective
or
ab
initio,
only
two
instead
of
three
are
provided,
i
respectfully
submit
the
situation
is
substantially
similar,
the
two
men
left
remaining
are
exposed
to
the
risk
of
injury
because
of
the
insufficiency
of
what
they
are
continuing
to
work
with.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
the
fourth
is
available
and
is
used?
do
i
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
--
well
--
and
now
functions
in
someway
or
is
insufficient
and
ab
initio
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
--
but
the
fourth
with
which
is
being
used
as
if
in
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
oh,
and
the
fourth
is
the
one
man
instead
of
the
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
three
machines?
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
clearly
if
what
is
provided
to
do
the
job
is
insufficient
for
the
task
either
because
three
machines
are
out
of
order,
which
is
almost
the
standard
in
simplest
terms
--
cases
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
it
was
not
used
or
it
broke
during
the
accident,
i
would
assume
without
question
your
honor
that
if
the
--
the
additive
to
the
one
man
is
insufficient
and
defective,
out
of
order,
that
unseaworthiness
liability
is
plain.
and
if
the
additive
if
i
may
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
if
i
may
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
absolutely.
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you
for
the
extended
time.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
may
it
please
the
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court.
this
maritime
action
arises
in
grant
a
certiorari
from
the
second
circuit
following
a
trial
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
during
the
course
of
which
or
at
the
close
of
which,
after
all
the
evidence
was
in,
the
trial
court
determined
to
dismiss
a
portion
of
the
seaman's
claim
and
to
refuse
to
permit
the
jury
to
pass
upon
it.
and
that
specific
claim
is
what
is
before
the
court
now,
and
that
is
whether
the
fact
as
was
demonstrated
by
fact
testimony
and
expert
testimony
that
there
were
an
insufficient
number
of
men
provided
for
a
particular
test
aboard
the
ship
at
the
particular
time
and
place
the
job
function
was
to
be
carried
out
was
within
the
reach
and
doctrine
scope
of
the
concept
of
unseaworthiness.
the
second
circuit
divided
two
to
one
on
the
matter.
indeed,
the
trial
court
had
himself
change
his
mind
during
the
course
of
the
case,
having
first
decided
it
in
favor
of
the
seaman
and
this
court
of
course
has
granted
certiorari.
now
the
issue
as
presented
might
be
deemed
noble
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
not
specifically
passed
upon
it
in
the
sense
of
manpower
insufficiency
creating
unseaworthiness
or
at
least
a
jury
question
for
resolution.
but
this
court
has
of
course
on
numerous
occasions
stated
quite
clearly
that
any
insufficiency
of
equipment,
the
pertinences
or
appliances
for
a
particular
task
at
the
time
and
place
the
task
is
performed
aboard
the
ship
gives
rise
to
a
condition
of
unseaworthiness,
at
the
very
least,
creates
a
question
for
jury
resolution.
and
of
course,
this
court's
historic
and
landmark
position
in
mitchell
v.
trawler
racer
enunciated
more
clearly
than
ever
before
that
the
doctrines
and
concepts
and
concerns
of
negligence
law
were
to
be
completely
eliminated
from
any
determination
of
unseaworthiness
liability.
of
course,
that
was
again
reiterated
in
the
gutierrez
opinion
and
in
the
reed
opinion
of
some
three
terms
ago.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
your
honor,
this
was
tried
before
a
jury,
it
was
tried
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
on
the
civil
side.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
your
honor,
that
takes
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
and
no
your
honor.
i
say
no
because
in
the
fitzgerald
case,
when
the
maintenance
and
cure
was
joined
with
the
unseaworthiness
and
the
jones
act
claim,
it
was
held
by
this
court,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black,
i
had
the
pleasure
of
arguing
the
case,
that
the
matter
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
all
maritime
matters
arising
out
of
the
same
accident
where
the
proceeding
on
the
theory
of
negligence
under
the
jones
act
unseaworthiness
on
the
general
maritime
law
or
even
if
maintenance
and
cure
with
its
different
concepts
of
damages
were
all
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes
i
would
say
that,
yes
and
no
in
this
instance
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
right,
assuming
no
diversity
of
citizenship,
it
would
be
purely
an
admiralty
if
brought
in
the
federal
court
because
it
could
be
brought
under
the
common
law
in
the
state
court
where
you
would
get
a
jury
and
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
it
regularly
occurs.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
we
had
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
that
was
discussed
if
i
may
say
in
the
fitzgerald
briefs,
but
i
think
the
law
is
to
that
effect.
i
recall
distinctly
in
the
court.
but
regardless
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
the
question
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
that's
correct.
well,
it
has
determined
the
negligence
claim
against
it.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
if
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
splitting
heads
your
honor
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
this
problem
has
given
very
careful
--
has
given
rise,
it's
a
very
careful
thought.
let
me
say
this.
in
the
bartholomew,
the
universe
tankships
case
decided
by
the
second
circuit,
it
was
a
concurring
and
lengthy
and
scholarly
opinion
by
chief
judge
lumbard,
the
second
circuit
in
which
he
point
--
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
an
unseaworthiness
claim
is
not
within
the
jones
act
that
the
reach
and
intention
of
the
jones
act
was
not
nearly
negligence
but
to
also
incorporate
a
claim
based
solely
on
unseaworthiness
and
therefore
even
a
purely
unseaworthiness
claim
would
give
rise
to
the
jury
rights
established
by
the
jones
act.
now
that
was
the
concurring
opinion
that
scholarly
--
in
a
scholarly
fashion
raised
questions,
it
has
never
been
resolved.
to
a
certain
extent,
it
was
before
this
court
in
romero.
to
a
certain
extent,
i
urge
that
it
has
no
alternative
grounds
of
deciding
the
fitzgerald
case,
the
court
didn't
feel
necessary.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
that
is
correct,
but
it
--
in
that
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
right.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
which
chief
judge
lumbard
raised
the
question
your
honor
was
whether
the
jones
act
doesn't
in
fact
incorporate
the
common
law
rights
of
those
men
who
worked
in
the
manner
that
they
worked.
and
since
of
course
railroad
workers
do
not
work
at
sea,
they
didn't
have
those
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
common
law
rights
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it's
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes.
that
--
that's
a
separate
problem,
of
course
if
i
may
answer
this
specifically
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
the
question
that
is
involved
is
whether
assuming
that
we're
entitled
to
our
trial,
do
we
go
back
to
a
trial
by
jury
or
a
trial
without
a
jury.
then,
i
answer
this
way
if
i
may
and
perhaps
prematurely,
but
nevertheless,
that
the
trial
must
be
by
jury,
a
separate
question
on
what
must
be
decided
by
this
court
at
this
time
i
would
submit,
because
the
law
is
clear
that
where
there
are
related
and
intertwined
actions
based
--
which
due
give
rise
to
a
jury
rights
such
as
the
pending
jurisdiction
cases.
and
the
case
upon
which
jurisdiction
and
jury
right
originally
was
based,
falls
by
the
wayside,
not
even
by
trial
but
even
earlier,
by
motion.
the
line
of
cases
which
we
did
not
brief
because
we
did
not
realized
that
question
will
be
presented
--
decided,
state
that
the
trial
by
jury
and
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
on
the
civil
side
continues.
it
is
only
if
the
action
which
gave
basis
to
the
civil
court
federal
jurisdiction
has
been
found
to
be
without
color
and
merely
presented
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
the
jurisdiction
that
the
pending
case
lose
its
all
--
loses
all
its
status
to
be
decided
as
it
would
be
if
the
other
actions
didn't
fall.
that
i
submit
is
my
understanding
of
that
area.
in
any
case,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
specific
question
of
unseaworthiness,
whether
it
gives
rise
to
a
question
for
jury
resolution
or
i
might
argue
and
certainly
willing
to
argue
that
it
gives
rise
to
an
issue
of
law
that
unquestionably,
the
facts
were
found
as
we
submit
them,
unseaworthiness
did
exist.
now
i
can
see
that
here
there
was
a
dispute.
an
expert
testimony
--
tried,
others
testified
and
said
--
we
said
that
there
was
unseaworthiness
that
there
was
a
regular
custom
and
practice
and
need
for
three
to
four
men
to
perform
this
job.
that
fact
issue
was
disputed
by
the
defendants
who
said,
every
right
to
do.
but
we
submit
that
that
fact
issue
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
and
had
the
jury
found
that
three
or
four
men
were
required
to
the
performance
of
this
particular
task,
then
the
jury
should
have
been
struck
--
instructed
and
on
those
grounds
they
could
return
a
verdict
to
the
indigent
seaman.
now
the
defendant's
position
was
that
we
prove
that
the
shipowner
that
there
were
a
sufficient
number
of
men
overall
aboard
the
ship.
we
prove
that
the
coast
guard
had
issued
a
certificate
of
inspection
that
required
a
certain
number
of
able
bodied
seamen
and
ordinary
seamen
to
be
aboard
the
ship,
some
12
or
15
as
the
--
that
portion
of
the
deck
crew,
and
that
we
had
now
those
number
of
men
aboard
the
ship.
therefore,
regardless
of
the
proof
and
fact
that
at
a
particular
time
and
place,
at
1:30
in
the
afternoon
on
may
8,
1960
as
the
ship
was
docking
at
this
brooklyn
pier,
only
two
men
were
assigned
for
a
particular
task,
and
regardless
of
the
facts
that
there
was
adequate
proof
that
two
men
were
not
sufficient.
when
i
say
adequate,
i
mean
adequate
at
least
to
go
to
jury.
then,
the
matter
must
be
dismissed
as
a
matter
of
law
because
we
had
these
other
13
to
15
men
aboard
the
ship.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
totally
contrary
to
the
clear
position
that
this
court
stated
in
the
mahnich
decision,
mahnich
v.
southern
steamship
companies,
from
1944,
where
it
said
explicitly,
that
the
fact
that
there
were
sufficient
equipment
aboard
the
vessel,
sufficient
and
proper,
does
not
mean
that
the
ship
cannot
be
found
unseaworthy
if
at
the
particular
time
and
place
that
the
job
function
is
carried
out
there
is
a
defect
or
inadequacy.
in
the
mahnich
case,
there
was
some
rope
lying
in
the
bin,
the
officer
just
as
here,
there
was
a
mate,
the
mate
reached
into
the
bin
and
pulled
out
some
rope
and
its
--
was
set
up
for
staging
to
hold
a
certain
weight,
certain
staging.it
turned
out
that
that
rope
had
a
latent
defect.
the
mate
was
is
no
way
negligent
in
selecting
that
rope.
he
could
not
know
that
it
had
a
latent
defect
hidden
within
it.
the
staging
collapsed
and
the
seaman
was
injured.
it
was
clearly
stated
by
this
case
--
by
this
court
that
although
there
was
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
mate
and
although
there
need
be
found
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
mate,
and
although
the
defect
was
completely
latent
and
hidden,
the
fact
that
there
was
this
insufficiency
of
the
rope
gave
rise
to
condition
of
unseaworthiness.
and
further,
this
court
stated
that
although
the
--
there
was
proven
to
be
a
sufficient
amount
of
safe
and
proper
and
non-defective
rope
aboard
this
very
ship
and
so
that
the
shipowner
had
indeed
equipped
the
ship
with
sufficient
proper
rope,
had
sent
it
out
on
the
seas
with
sufficient
and
proper
rope,
in
no
way
but
the
claim
of
unseaworthiness
because
at
the
particular
time
and
place
the
job
function
was
carried
out,
improper,
insufficient,
inadequate
rope
was
in
fact
used
giving
rise
to
the
injury.
now
the
only
question
as
i
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
your
honor,
the
distinction
is
this,
that
in
this
case
in
our
waldron
case,
the
work
to
be
performed
involved
manpower,
what
was
holding
up
the
load,
what
was
pulling
the
weight
and
withstanding
the
forces
of
gravity
and
its
inertia,
were
not
here
a
rope
as
in
mahnich,
but
was
men's
backs.
so
manpower
in
a
primitive
way
because
no
machinery
could
here
do
that
job
were
being
used
where
men
were
used
in
mahnich
and
that
was
the
--
that
that's
the
difference,
but
other
than
that
that,
there
is
no
difference.
now,
there
are
enumerable
occasions
aboard
ship
and
not
on
board
ship
when
men
must
simply
do
the
work.
automation
has
not
yet
completely
taken
place
aboard
ship
or
elsewhere.
and
the
question
is
whether
when
men
are
used
instead
of
machines
or
equipment.
does
the
protection
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
end?
does
mahnich
not
reached
where
men's
back
instead
of
manufactured
equipment
are
being
used?
and
i
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
in
law
or
logic
or
sense
of
justice
for
any
such
line
to
be
drawn
and
there
is
no
indicated
case
by
this
court
that
suggests
any
such
arbitrary
cutoff
of
the
beneficial
doctrine.
this
court
has
frequently
pointed
out
that
the
reason
for
this
doctrine
is
that
men
go
out
on
the
seas
and
are
exposed
to
certain
kinds
of
routine
hazards
that
do
occur
aboard
ship.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
hurricane
and
the
perils
and
the
unusual
storm
of
the
sea
that
mr.
justice
stewart
--
i
would
think
had
in
mind
when
he's
pointed
out
in
mitchell
for
this
court
that
the
ship
need
not
whether
every
peril
and
every
storm
to
be
deemed
seaworthy.
there
maybe
occasions.
but
this
is
not
such
an
unusual
or
particularly
a
strange
circumstance,
the
fact
that
men
will
have
to
hold
ropes
or
lines
or
weights
aboard
a
ship
is
one
of
the
most
common
occurrences
aboard
the
ship.
the
ship
is
that
--
i'm
sure
this
court
is
familiar,
has
many
narrow
areas,
many
stairways,
many
places
and
times
when
men's
backs
must
do
the
physical
labor
and
be
exposed
to
certain
hazards
that
can
occur.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
taking
that
in
mind,
the
awkward
situation
where
eight
men
are
told
to
grab
a
small
item
and
they're
sort
of
nudging
each
other
in
going
down
the
stairway
and
that
gives
rise
to
an
accident.
i
would
not
hesitate
to
say
your
honor
that
that
too
would
create
a
type
of
dangerous
condition
that
would
involve
an
unseaworthy
and
unsafe
condition.
i
don't
know
if
the
resolution
of
that
question
hinges
upon
this
question
because
here,
there's
an
unquestioned
insufficiency.
again,
when
i
say
unquestioned,
i
mean
that
the
plaintiff's
prima
facie
evidence
established
that,
entitling
him
to
have
that
dispute
resolved
by
the
jury
or
by
the
trier
of
fact,
whoever
that
will
ultimately
be.
but
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
an
insufficiency.
captain
darigan
(ph),
the
expert
with
some
50
years
of
experience
stated
flatly
that
this
job
needed
three
to
four
men
and
there
were
only
two
and
that's
an
unquestioned
--
undisputed
gap
in
--
i
mean,
difference
in
the
testimony.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
they
were
on
the
stern
of
the
vessel
and
what
occurred
here
your
honor
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
don't
know
if
--
what
--
yes,
forward
of
the
stern
area.
what
happened
was
that
they
were
coming
into
a
new
pier
in
brooklyn
that
had
not
been
much
used.
and
suddenly
there
came
an
order
to
the
third
mate
relayed
in
the
intra-communication
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
system
to
get
a
line
out
at
this
forward
chuck.
when
i
say
forward,
it's
sort
of
halfway
towards
mid-ships
and
the
stern
area.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it
was
a
spring
line.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
suddenly
he
said,
“will
you
two
fellows
go
up
and
put
out
that
line”.
and
that
was
unusual,
that
was
different
in
the
usual
routine.
and
so
the
third
mate
said,
“i
wasn't
negligent
in
responding
to
the
situation,
in
responding
to
the
order”.
and
he
certainly
had
a
strong
in
the
jury's
sympathetic
imposition
to
maintain
that
why
should
he
personally
with
what
the
--
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
was
involved,
why
should
he
personally
be
charged
of
being
negligent
in
sending
these
men
up
to
do
it.
but
the
point
was
that
the
result
was
that
two
men
were
lugging
and
dealing
on
a
steel
misty
deck
of
weight
that
involved
according
to
the
testimony
or
should
have
involved
three
to
four
men.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it
was
a
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it
was
an
8-inch
manila
line.
there
was
some
56
feet
from
the
place
where
it
was
coiled
to
the
forward
chuck
where
it
was
to
be
laid
out
and
they
were
of
course
working
as
diligently
and
urgently
as
possible
on
--
which
--
was
what
--
was
required
to
be
done.
and
it
was
a
--
there
was
some
mist
on
the
air
and
they
were
moving
as
fast
as
they
could
and
one
of
the
men
hauling
it
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
he
slipped,
as
he
was
falling
backwards.
the
testimony
was,
using
this
--
with
this
weight
on
him,
he
went
out
from
under
and
he
hurt
his
back.
the
medical
group
wasn't
as
highly
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
it
was
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
no,
i
mean
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
the
--
he
slipped
on
the
deck
but
not
because
the
deck
was
in
itself
slippery.
there
was
a
contention
that
the
deck
was
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
the
weight
of
the
line
gave
rise
to
a
certain
resistance,
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
a
four-inch
line
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
because
there
wasn't
any
tension
in
the
sense
the
line
wasn't
being
held
back
by
any
kind
of
spring.
it
was
coiled
on
a
56-feet
--
they
lifted
sections
of
it.
they
lifted
up
the
line
and
went
up
the
deck
with
it
on
their
backs.
and
so
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
made
a
difference
whether
it
was
eight-inch
or
four-inch
line,
but
regardless,
all
of
those
facts
presented
to
captain
darigan
(ph)
and
the
expert
was
sufficient
for
him
to
--
or
to
his
opinion,
that
the
line
required
this
particular
functions,
particular
job
functions
required
three
to
four
men
for
its
safe
performance
and
there
was
a
dispute
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
one
might
have
thought
so
in
the
sense
that
it
would
make
an
appealing
jury
argument.
but
on
the
counter
argument
was
the
third
mate,
mr.
tarantino
who
came
by
way
of
deposition
but
in
any
case
the
evidence
was,
he
said
i
wasn't
negligent.
i
was
responding
to
the
immediate
situation.
i
had
only
five
men
back
at
the
stern
area
with
me.
the
other
three
men
were
diligently
putting
lines
out
to
the
stern
area
itself.
when
i
gave
two
men
in
response
to
this
that
was
the
most
i
could
do
in
the
circumstances,
why
should
i
be
penalized
by
the
owners
who
are
being
denominated
as
negligent
in
the
situation
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
and
that
argument,
one-jury
appealed.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
not
have
begun
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
had
the
jury
rendered
a
defendant's
verdict
on
all
of
the
claims
that
should've
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
it
was
an
issue
for
the
jury
to
decide.
but
the
jury
didn't
get
the
opportunity
to
decide
it.
i
submit
that
it
was
a
proper
argument
to
make
to
the
jury
that
in
the
circumstances,
mate
tarantino
was
not
negligent.
he
was
performing
his
work
as
carefully
and
as
reasonably
as
a
man
could
do
under
the
circumstances
but
nevertheless
an
unsafe
condition
did
arise
and
these
men
were
exposed
to
danger
and
should
be
compensated
on
the
very
point
of
difference
that
the
mitchell
case,
the
reed
case
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
no.
and
that
is
what
this
case
is,
i
respectfully
submit,
all
about.
is
there
an
area
of
liability
where
there
is
not
negligence
within
the
concept
in
reach
of
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness.
and
i
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
what
this
case
does
is
focus
on
the
question
as
to
whether
that
broad
doctrine
enunciated
in
mitchell
and
as
i
submit,
enunciated
in
mahnich
which
as
this
--
as
your
honor
pointed
out
was
a
leading
landmark
case
to
be
continued
--
to
be
followed,
is
focused
on
the
insufficiency
of
manpower,
is
there
to
be
a
division,
a
change
because
what
is
insufficiently
provided
is
manpower
as
distinct
from
equipment.
if
i
may
say
mr.
justice
white,
the
same
argument,
the
same
problem
could
arise
if
what
was
not
provided
to
the
seaman
doing
the
job
was
a
piece
of
machinery
or
equipment
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
to
help
him.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
if
there
were
no
unseaworthiness,
i
would
lose.
there
is
no
negligence
and
there
is
no
unseaworthiness
and
there
has
to
be
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
a
defendant's
verdict.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
but
--
the
jury
didn't
think
there
was
negligence.
the
jury
was
not
presented,
given
opportunity
to
decide
the
question.
what
i
want
this
court
respectfully
to
do
is
to
let
me
go
back
and
submit
that
question
to
a
jury
or
if
a
further
research
that
indicates
with
admiralty
judge,
and
have
them
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
there
was
unseaworthiness.
this
was
a
premature
judicial
dismissal
of
a
claim
that
should've
been
submitted
to
a
jury
under
a
host
of
cases
that
had
been
decided
by
this
court
particularly
dealing
with
seamen's
claims
injured
during
their
employment.
now,
i
want
to
refer
very
respectfully
and
very
briefly
to
the
coast
guard
manning
regulations
that
are
referred
to
by
my
adversary's
brief.
there
was
--
i
think
i
referred
to
it
before
coast
guard
certificate,
i
think
i've
already
indicated
that
these
coast
guard
certificates
do
not
pretend
to
lay
down
the
number
of
men
that
have
to
be
employed
on
a
particular
job.
there
are
--
one
certificate
that
are
posted
somewhere
a
mid-ship
to
say
the
ship
shall
have
12
able-bodied
seamen
and
eight
ordinary
seamen,
period.
how
many
men
should
be
on
the
rear
gang
and
how
many
men
should
be
mid-ship
and
how
many
men
shall
deal
with
a
particular
rope,
the
coast
guard
doesn't
begin
to
attempt
to
deal
with
and
obviously,
if
the
mere
fact
that
the
coast
guard
certificate
has
been
met,
you
could
split
all
the
men
on
vacation,
have
one
man
do
all
the
jobs
and
say
that
there
could
be
no
unseaworthiness
for
insufficient
manning.
the
insufficient
manning
per
se
is
unquestionably
been
recognized
as
the
grounds
for
unseaworthiness.
we
have
only
to
this
--
to
reach
the
question
in
this
court
i
respectfully
submit,
as
to
whether
the
insufficient
manning
where
the
ship
to
leave
the
port
without
sufficient
number
of
men
is
also
to
be
found
as
imposing
liability
when
the
condition
arises
temporarily
during
the
course
of
the
work
while
the
ship
was
on
the
high
seas.
and
again,
i
submit,
this
court
held
in
mitchell
and
is
held
time
and
time
again
that
the
fact
that
the
condition
is
a
temporary
one
and
arises
only
during
the
course
of
the
trip
rather
than
at
the
inception
when
the
ship
leaves
the
port
certainly
does
not
excuse
or
exonerate
the
shipowner
from
liability.
indeed
i
may
say
because,
mr.
justice
medina's
--
excuse
judge
medina's
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
gave
some
passing
reference
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
decision
in
the
dickson
against
united
states
written
on
the
second
circuit,
in
which
as
i
recall
it,
the
opinion
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
the
fact
that
the
ship's
unseaworthiness
condition
arises
while
the
ship
is
on
the
high
seas
as
distinct
when
the
ship
leaves
the
port
might
therefore
not
give
rise
to
unseaworthiness
liability.
and
i
think
that
the
opinion
below
attempts
to
give
continued
application
to
that
distinction
when
i
think
this
court
in
mitchell
very
explicitly
stated
that
the
facts
and
the
conditions
is
temporary
and
the
fact
that
the
condition
arises
when
the
ship
is
on
the
high
seas
as
distinct
from
before
it
leaves
the
port
does
not
exonerate
and
excuse
the
shipowner.
and
so
i
think
that
what
happened
below
was
that
an
application
of
the
doctrine
that
has
already
in
mitchell
been
laid
to
rest
by
this
court
was
sought
to
be
imposed
on
one
fragmentary
area,
where
the
insufficiency
of
manpower
as
distinct
from
equipment.
and
i
think
i've
already
spoke
into
that
point
as
to
the
facts
that
there
is
an
absolute
equivalence.
this
court
has
pointed
out
there's
an
absolute
equivalence
in
the
boudoin
and
other
cases
between
insufficiency
of
personnel
and
insufficiency
equipment
obviously
in
the
regular
course
of
work
aboard
the
ship,
men
are
sometimes
called
upon
to
do
that
which
machinery
cannot
do
and
there
should
be
no
sharp
or
strange
or
unsupported
division
between
the
liabilities
that
should
be
imposed.
and
i
would
respectfully
with
the
court's
permission
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
with
the
courts
permission,
i
would
like
to
speak
directly
to
the
question
of
the
coast
guard
regulations
that
have
been
so
heavily
relied
upon.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
contains
testimony
on
page
8,
by
the
petitioner
seaman
himself
that
the
job
as
a
matter
of
regular
custom,
this
particular
job
involved
a
minimum
of
three
men.
and
one
man
had
to
be
at
the
chuck.
now,
your
honor,
the
spring
line,
the
line
is
going
out,
there's
a
tremendous
amount
of
tension
and
pressure
on
it.
it
is
a
heavy
line.
one
man
would
be
at
the
chuck
letting
the
line
out
in
controlling
it
otherwise
it
can
become
literally
a
snake
aboard
the
vessel
and
cause
all
kinds
of
injury.
and
two
men
must
slog
it
and
that
is
right
on
page
8.
now,
i
advert
to
that
particularly
because
there
is
this
reference
that
it
was
--
and
this
without
regard,
it
will
happen
to
be
an
unusual
chuck
to
use
anywhere
that
such
a
spring
line
is
being
led
out,
be
it
a
chuck
a
little
farther
forward
or
a
little
farther
back,
it
involves
those
number
of
men,
so
testified
by
the
petitioner.
now,
there
is
adversion
to
the
fact
that
they
were
--
it
was
conceded
that
five
men
was
the
usual
aft
gang
docking
crew
and
five
men
were
there
provided.
that's
true.
but
it
was
also
testified
if
you
want
to
split
it
down,
that
usually
three
men
at
least
will
provide
it
before
we
even
got
to
the
expert
testimony
for
this
particular
kind
of
operation
and
that
was
not
met
according
to
the
petitioner's
testimony
in
this
case.
my
learned
friend
says,
all
of
this
is
irrelevant
provided
there
were
15
abs
and
12
oss
aboard
the
ship
if
that
what
the
coast
guard
certificate
posted
in
mid
ships
required.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
he
has
not
been
able
to
and
i've
not
been
able
to
find
a
single
iota
of
authority
that
suggest
that
that
type
of
compliance
with
the
overall
coast
guard
regulations
will
suffice
to
deal
with
a
job
as
it
is
performed
at
the
particular
time
and
place.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
the
instruction
would
be
that
in
the
event
the
jury
believed
that
the
safe
performance
of
this
work
required
the
use
of
three
to
four
men
because
of
the
load
and
the
tension
and
the
manner
in
which
this
rope
and
line
had
to
be
handled,
and
in
fact
they
find
that
less
than
three
men
were
used.
and
they
find
that
such
failure
to
provide
three
men
and
the
use
of
only
two
men
contributed
to
causing
the
injuries
complained
of
that
they
may
find
that
the
vessel,
the
shipowner
is
responsible
in
damages
to
the
seaman
injured
during
the
course
of
his
employment.
and
that
your
honor
is
precisely
as
i
see
it
what
seaworthiness
liability
is
all
about.
the
risks
and
the
hazards
of
the
maritime
employment
ought
to
be
protected
and
accepted
and
compensated
by
the
shipowner
because
of
the
standard
concepts
of
risk
sharing
and
risk
distribution
that
have
been
enunciated
and
described
by
this
court
in
seas
shipping
co.
v.
sieracki
and
again
by
mr.
justice
black
recently
in
the
reed
v.
yaka
case
and
down
through
the
agents.
and
that
is
the
social
outlook
that
this
court
has
enunciated
and
there
has
been
no
reason
presented
as
i
can
see
it
for
why
this
case
should
be
lifted
out
where
the
seaman
is
injured
doing
the
ordinary
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
course
of
his
employment.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
if
a
seaman
is
in
fact
injured
and
we
have
to
start
with
that.
he's
injured
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
during
the
course
of
his
employment,
he's
an
injured
man.
if
in
fact
the
reason
that
he
is
injured
is
that
he
was
injected
into
an
unsafe
condition
because
of
the
performance
of
his
work
and
if
that
unsafe
condition
arose
out
of
the
fact
that
a
shipowner
did
not
provide
him
with
sufficient
support,
be
it
physical,
equipment,
or
manpower,
then
indeed
your
honor,
i
read
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
i
may
answer,
i
focused
on
that
part
of
your
question
which
said,
assuming
a
crew
adequate
for
the
particular
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
part
of
the
ship,
because
i
do
not
find
and
i
submit
the
petitioner's
testimony
was
that
the
crew
provided
was
not
adequate
for
the
particular
job
being
performed.
there
were
five
men
back
in
the
rear
of
the
ship
but
there
weren't
enough
men
doing
this
particular
job
and
as
i
said
in
the
outset
and
i
will
close
with
it,
managed
to
my
mind,
so
completely
disposes
of
that
concept
that
if
at
the
particular
performance
of
the
job
function,
sufficient
assistance
is
not
provided
and
a
seaman
is
injured
in
the
manner
which
i've
stated,
then
he
is
to
be
cared
for
by
the
shipping
company
which
can
distribute
the
rest
more
ably
than
the
individuals.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
what
is
now
left
outside
the
concepts
of
seaworthiness?
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
your
honor,
that
concept
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
alright.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
if
a
seaman
is
injured
as
a
result
of
a
ship
officer's
negligence,
the
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
right
to
recover
is
not
within
dispute.
your
honor
i
believe
is
asking
me
when
--
what
kind
of
accident
can
occur
aboard
the
ship
that
he
is
not
entitled
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
what
happened
is
that
sometimes
the
instrument
of
injury
does
not
involve
any
negligent
act
on
the
part
of
the
ship's
officers
and
yet
the
man
is
injured
and
an
unsafe
condition
is
created
as
indeed
the
facts
that's
that
i've
described
within
mahnich
with
the
rope,
the
latent
defect
rope
was
unwittingly
taken
out
of
the
bin
or
in
the
circumstances
here
involved
and
yet
the
seaman
is
injured
and
should
be
compensated
because
of
an
insufficiency
aboard
the
ship.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
to
extend
on
that,
i
would
say
yes
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
let's
assume
just
that
happens
and
a
sufficient
number
of
men
are
sent
forth.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
let's
assume
that
suddenly
one
men
has
some
kind
of
convulsion
or
stroke
and
he
collapses
on
the
job,
he's
been
sent
by
the
mate
and
he
collapses
on
the
job,
in
fact
to
extend
it
if
i
may,
let's
assume
that
he
only
sent
three,
so
the
one
man
who
collapses
now
leaves
the
condition
that
originally
occurred
here
of
two,
and
the
two
men
continuing
with
the
job,
being
insufficient,
the
accident
occurs.
i
respectfully
submit
that
while
that's
not
this
case,
that
fact
is
that
the
other
two
men
are
remained
exposed
to
the
insufficiency
of
support
of
the
accident
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
negligence
liability
and
unseaworthiness
liability.
assume
if
your
honor
made
--
if
i
may
say,
that
what
they
gave
was
three
ropes
to
support
a
staging,
or
four
ropes,
and
one
rope
collapses
because
it's
a
latent
defect
and
the
man
is
injured,
certainly
no
one
would
suggest,
“well,
you
had
two
other
good
ropes
or
we
did
originally
provide
you
with
three.”
if
one
breaks
down
either
during
the
job
because
its
defective
or
ab
initio,
only
two
instead
of
three
are
provided,
i
respectfully
submit
the
situation
is
substantially
similar,
the
two
men
left
remaining
are
exposed
to
the
risk
of
injury
because
of
the
insufficiency
of
what
they
are
continuing
to
work
with.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
the
fourth
is
available
and
is
used?
do
i
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
--
well
--
and
now
functions
in
someway
or
is
insufficient
and
ab
initio
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
--
but
the
fourth
with
which
is
being
used
as
if
in
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
oh,
and
the
fourth
is
the
one
man
instead
of
the
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
three
machines?
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
clearly
if
what
is
provided
to
do
the
job
is
insufficient
for
the
task
either
because
three
machines
are
out
of
order,
which
is
almost
the
standard
in
simplest
terms
--
cases
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
and
it
was
not
used
or
it
broke
during
the
accident,
i
would
assume
without
question
your
honor
that
if
the
--
the
additive
to
the
one
man
is
insufficient
and
defective,
out
of
order,
that
unseaworthiness
liability
is
plain.
and
if
the
additive
if
i
may
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
if
i
may
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
absolutely.
thank
you
very
much.
thank
you
for
the
extended
time.
