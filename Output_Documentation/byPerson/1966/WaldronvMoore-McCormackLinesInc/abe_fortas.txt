tripped
on
the
deck,
was
he?
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
that
contradictory
what
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
or
do
i
misunderstand
you?
i
thought
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
it
would
be
unseaworthiness
if
they
fail
to
have
the
minimum
coast
guard
prescribed
compliment
of
men?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
won't
forget
about
that.
let's
stray
it
on
the
seaman,
various
categories
of
able
bodied
seamen
and
ordinary
and
so
on.
i
thought
--
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
your
position
is
because
i
thought
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
a
failure
to
have
the
minimum
coast
guard
prescribed
compliment
in
that
respect
would
constitute
unseaworthiness
and
i
suppose
that
if
it
constitute
unseaworthiness
then
the
petitioner
here
or
situation
like
this
it
would
follow
that
this
petitioner
would
be
able
to
recover?
justice
abe
fortas
and
now
you
just
clarified
my
thinking
in
your
view.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
you'd
say
that
it,
that
if
unseaworthiness
would
exist
that
recovery
might
not
follow
because
it
--
you
might
be
able
to
show
that
there
was
no
cause
or
relation
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
just
between
the
unseaworthy
condition
and
the
injury
complained
of.
justice
abe

mr.
friedman,

i
ask
you
this.
what
in
--

a
jury,
what
instruction
to
the
jury

for
now

your
theory
of
the
case?
