mr.
william
m.
kimball
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
question
presented
is
whether
with
respect
to
the
number
of
crewmen,
a
vessel
is
reasonably
fit
for
her
intended
service
if
she
has
aboard
more
than
the
number
fixed
by
the
coast
guard
for
her
safe
navigation
pursuant
to
statute.
soon
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
mr.
bamberger
of
the
new
york
times
wrote
sources
on
admiralty
law
expressed
the
view
last
week
that
the
supreme
court
would
establish
a
precedent
of
far
reaching
importance
to
shipowners
if
it
upheld
mr.
waldron.
such
a
decision
may
said,
might
upset
current
manning
scales
if
damage
awards
were
such
as
to
make
it
advisable
for
a
shipowner
to
assign
a
larger
crew
than
is
now
normal
to
ship
port
tasks.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
it's
an
interesting
observation
your
honor
and
i'd
like
to
make
reference
to
a
little
bit
later.
i
think
mr.
bamberger's
wrong
for
reasons
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
put
his
finger
on
a
moment
ago.
now
this
vessel
had
more
than
the
number
of
sailors
required
by
the
coast
guard
officer-in-charge
of
marine
inspection.
there
is
no
claim
that
any
of
those
personnel
were
incompetent.
we
had
a
“very
good”
11-minute
docking
operation.
during
the
course
of
which,
there
was
a
last
minute
decision
by
pier
master
to
put
out
another
spring
line.
the
third
mate
ordered
the
plaintiff
and
another
able
seaman
to
put
that
line
out.
there
was
no
misuse
or
nonuse
of
available
personnel.
the
mate
used
all
of
the
personnel
that
he
had
and
he
had
the
normal
number
at
aft
docking
station.
everyone
was
urgently
engaged
in
performing
other
tasks
connected
with
getting
out
other
lines.
these
two
men,
the
plaintiff
and
another
were
more
or
less
available
and
were
assigned
to
put
out
this
additional
line.
the
jury
found
that
the
mates
order
was
not
negligent.
now
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
but
it
was
slightly
out
of
the
ordinary
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
only
in
that
there
was
testimony
by
plaintiff's
witnesses
who
were
experienced
ship
personnel
that
never
before
in
the
docking
of
this
vessel
had
there
been
any
order
which
required
the
use
of
this
particular
chuck
which
was
some
56
feet
away
from
the
place
where
the
aft
mooring
lines
were
coiled.
it
was
slightly
unusual.
but
to
attempt
to
face
up
to
your
honor's
question,
i
think
the
answer
must
or
should
be
that
if
a
vessel
has
aboard
the
number
required
by
the
coast
guard
for
her
safe
navigation.
and
some
incident,
some
not
unusual
incident
occurs
aboard
vessel
which
requires
assignment
of
some
of
those
personnel
then,
the
only
way,
the
only
theory
upon
which
the
plaintiff
could
recover
would
be
that
the
mate
or
whoever
it
was
who
issued
the
order
was
negligent
in
not
assigning
more
or
conceivably
less
of
the
available
ship's
complement
to
perform
a
particular
task.
now,
under
the
regulations
pursuant
to
statute,
the
officer
in
charge
of
marine
inspection
is
required
to
take
into
consideration
many
factors
in
determining
the
number
of
personnel
required
to
safely
navigate
a
ship.
the
regulations
attempt
to
list
some
of
those
many
factors
and
then
they
run
out
of
gas
and
use
and
et
cetera
to
indicate
the
extensiveness
of
the
factors
which
are
and
must
be
considered
in
determining
the
number
of
personnel
required
to
safely
man
a
vessel.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
there
was
evidence
and
an
admission
by
plaintiff's
expert
that
there
are
at
least
25
common
factors
which
must
be
taken
into
consideration,
weighed,
balanced
and
harmonized
in
determining
how
many
men
should
be
assigned
to
do
any
particular
tasks
during
the
course
of
a
normal
docking
operation.
but
notwithstanding
all
of
these
factors
and
considerations,
plaintiff's
expert
testified
in
vacuo
that
“safe
and
prudent
seamanship”
required
that
three
or
four
men
be
assigned.
be
assigned
to
do
what?
be
assigned
to
carry
or
drag
56-feet
of
brand
new
8-inch
manila
line.
but
the
record
is
perfectly
clear,
if
your
honors
please,
that
even
if
that
expert
testimony
were
valid
and
sufficient
to
raise
some
jury
question,
plaintiff
wasn't
doing
anything
of
that
nature
either
before
or
at
the
time
he
was
hurt.
plaintiff
wasn't
dragging
or
lifting
56-feet
of
line.
what
plaintiff
was
doing
according
to
his
own
testimony
which
appears
at
page
10
of
the
record
was,
he
was
standing
10
feet
away
from
a
coil
of
line
and
he
was
attempting
to
flake
out
of
that
coil
some
additional
line.
and
so
at
most,
the
plaintiff
was
attempting
to
partially
support
10
feet
and
not
56
feet
of
new
8-inch
manila
line.
there
isn't
any
testimony
or
evidence
in
this
case
of
any
unsafe
operation
which
is
a
phrase
frequently
employed
in
the
briefs
by
the
petitioner.
there
wasn't
any
testimony
of
any
custom
to
use
any
additional
personnel
as
is
implied
by
the
brief.
indeed,
the
testimony
is
that
the
plaintiff
with
one
other
had
put
out
two
other
mooring
lines
before
he
was
ordered
to
put
out
this
additional
line.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
you
would
have
most
probably
your
honor
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
cannot
see
any
distinction
there.
i
would
say
if
you
present
one
man
to
do
a
job
of
this
nature,
you
probably
would
have
a
pretty
good
claim
of
negligent
order.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
would
--
that
that
would
convert
this
fully,
confidently,
properly
manned
vessel
into
an
unseaworthy
vessel
because
the
mate
neglected
to
assign
additional
available
personnel
to
perform
the
job.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
cannot
grasp
your
honor's
questions
because
if
he
sends
no
one
the
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
--
the
job
would
not
be
done
i
suppose.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
the
mate
himself,
your
honor?
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
see
no
distinction
under
those
facts
with
your
honor's
former
question.
it
would
amount
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
--
merely
to
a
claim
failure
by
the
mate
to
assign
adequate
number
of
personnel
to
do
the
job.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
indeed,
if
your
honor
pleases,
almost
always
in
these
suits
where
a
claim
is
made
that
additional
personnel
should
have
been
assigned,
the
plaintiff
almost
always
testifies
that
he
protested
to
the
boatswain
or
the
mate
and
asked
for
additional
assistance
but
the
mate
or
the
boatswain
told
him
to
do
it
by
himself.
now
there
of
course
is
no
evidence
or
reasonable
inference
in
this
case
that
this
new
8-inch
manila
mooring
line
was
unseaworthy
or
more
particularly
that
it
was
unseaworthy
unless
three
or
four
men
used
it,
carried
or
dragged
it.
that
i
believe
was
what
redfern
--
apl,
american
president
lines
v.
redfern
was
all
about.
there
was
involved
a
stuck
valve
which
could
only
be
“broken”
by
two
men
or
by
one
man
using
a
particular
sort
of
a
wrench,
spanner
wrench.
one
man
without
wrench
was
sent
down
to
break
the
stuck
valve
and
in
attempting
to
do
so,
he
was
injured.
in
other
words,
as
i
read
redfern
and
as
judge
medina
obviously
read
it,
that
involved
the
case
of
equipment
which
was
unseaworthy
unless
the
additive
of
extra
manpower
or
special
equipment
was
furnished
to
sure,
rectify,
break
the
unseaworthy
condition
and
thereby
make
this
valve
reasonably
fit
for
its
intended
purpose.
now,
were
agreed
that
if
the
question
presented
is
the
one
that
i
first
stated,
it
has
never
been
directly
dealt
with
by
this
court.
in
addition
to
the
decisions
below,
there
are
three
other
lower
court
cases
which
have
dealt
with
the
question.
they're
cited
on
page
7
of
my
brief
and
all
of
them
were
decided
in
favor
of
the
shipowner.
judge
medina
said
and
i
believe
quite
correctly
so,
after
obviously
and
exhaustive
review
of
the
applicable
case
law,
that
there
are
quote
--
there
is
“no
authority
to
the
contrary”
of
the
decision
below.
now
to
get
back
to
mr.
bamberger's
observations,
i
believe
he's
wrong
in
suggesting
that
the
decision
in
this
case
might
impose
upon
shipowners
an
obligation
to
engage
two
or
three
times
as
many
men
to
perform
routine
chores
aboard
ship
as
are
now
engaged
pursuant
to
coast
guard
requirements,
because
that
wouldn't
do
any
good
if
your
honors
please.
if
they
had
a
150
men
on
a
vessel
which
is
now
normally
manned
by
20,
and
for
some
reason,
while
149
of
them
were
standing
around
admiring
the
scenery,
it
became
necessary
to
pick
up
a
bucket
or
a
tool
and
the
mate
assigned
one
of
150
potentially
available
crew
members
to
do
the
job,
that
wouldn't
permit
the
shipowner
to
escape
liability
if
there
were
reversal
in
this
case
because
some
expert
could
always
come
along
and
would
come
along
and
testified
that
two
or
three
or
five
men
were
needed.
so
the
mere
addition
by
the
shipowner
of
vast
hordes
of
unneeded
crewmembers
aboard
vessel
wouldn't
escape
the
consequences
of
reversal
in
this
decision
or
conversely,
if
he
had
a
150
crewmembers
aboard
a
20-crew
ship
and
out
of
extreme
concern
for
the
results
of
a
--
this
decision,
the
mate
assigned
15
men
to
picked
up
the
wrench,
then
of
course
that
decision
would
run
head
on
into
what
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
with
the
expert
testifying
that
this
was
a
job
which
only
one
of
the
150
men
should
have
been
assigned
to
do,
and
the
vessel
became
unseaworthy
because
five
men
were
assigned
to
do
a
one-man
job.
in
other
words,
i
suggest
your
honors
that
reversal
in
this
case
would
make
it
incumbent
upon
the
shipowner
to
attempt,
which
would
be
impossible,
to
see
that
in
every
instance
the
dozens
or
perhaps
hundreds
of
orders
which
are
issued
aboard
ship
each
day,
in
every
case,
the
person
giving
the
order
would
have
to
steer
the
perfect
line
between
assigning
too
few
and
too
many,
and
if
he
didn't,
then
the
vessel
regardless
of
how
many
people
were
aboard
or
available
or
how
competent
they
might
be,
the
shipowner
would
subjected
to
possible
liability
for
unseaworthiness
based
upon
high
insight
testimony
of
an
expert
in
quotes
who
i
suggest
your
honors,
there
isn't
any
deficiency
or
shortage
of
these
people
would
always
be
found
to
testify
that
either
more
or
less
men
should
have
been
assigned
to
do
every
job.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
made
a
motion
for
directive
verdict
on
that
ground
your
honor
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could
have
sustained
on
appeal
a
grant
of
that.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that's
correct
sir.
well,
there
really
wasn't
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
there
was
more
to
it
than
that
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that's
true,
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
because
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
think
juries
are
much
more
capable
of
dealing
with
a
charge
which
is
based
upon
a
claim
of
fault
in
failing
to
conduct
oneself
in
a
reasonably
proper
manner.
then
they
are
in
dealing
with
a
charge
that
regardless
of
any
concept
of
fault
and
regardless
of
how
much
diligence
the
defendant
may
have
exercised
in
an
effort
to
overcome
the
condition,
the
ship
is
still
absolutely
liable
if
the
jury
finds
that
under
these
particular
circumstances,
the
vessel
was
not
reasonably
fit
for
intended
purpose.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
if
the
dolly
breaks
down?
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
would
be
unseaworthy,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
is
not
unseaworthiness,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
with
a
little
additive
if
i
may
your
honor,
if
the
coast
guard
perhaps
had
specified
that
the
dolly
is
of
certain
type
of
spring
and
so
forth
and
in
certain
number
should
be
provided
to
move
a
piece
of
rope
and
the
coast
guard
--
and
the
shipowner
had
complied
with
those
regulations
more
than
100%
then
we
might
perhaps
have
a
different
result
to
the
questions
which
your
honor
has
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
to
a
large
extent,
yes,
your
honor.
and
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
any
of
these
men
was
incompetent.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
well,
they
ran
the
gamut
your
honor
from
--
we
had
ordinaries,
we
had
deck
utility
men,
we
had
able
seaman,
we
had
boatswain,
we
had
a
carpenter,
and
we
had
a
run
of
mates
that
constituted
our
deck
department.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
no,
sir.
there
was
a
mate,
and
i
believe
four
able
seamen
and
one
ordinary.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
normally,
there
were
would
have
been
in
the
aft
a
mate
and
three
able
and
two
ordinary.
but
one
of
the
ordinaries
was
in
the
ship's
hospital,
so
to
replace
him,
they
assigned
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
--
not
only
a
superior
ranking
but
it
turned
out
they
assigned
a
man
who
modestly
testified
that
he
was
the
strongest
and
biggest
and
most
proficient
seaman
on
the
ship.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
exactly.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
intend
to
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
attempted
to
answer,
to
suggest
to
the
court,
and
to
some
extent
deal
with
the
suggestion
that's
been
made
in
the
briefs
that
there
would
be
some
economic
repercussions
from
a
reversal
in
this
case
which
the
shipowner
might
avoid
by
hiring
more
people.
and
i
wanted
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
even
that
further
action
by
the
shipowner
could
not
overcome
the
adverse
consequences
of
the
reversal
in
this
decision
because
no
matter
how
many
people
he
adds,
there
still
comes
the
time
when
somebody
must
assign
a
certain
number
of
those
persons
to
do
a
particular
job,
and
if
a
vessel
is
unseaworthy,
because
of
a
non-negligent
order
assigning
either
too
few
or
as
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
perhaps
too
many
men
to
do
a
particular
job,
then
we
have
a
situation
where
potentially
with
every
order
issued
aboard
vessel,
there
can
be
a
claim
later
made
that
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy
because
the
exact
correct
number
of
persons
were
not
assigned
to
do
the
job.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
unquestionably
so,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
is
true
sir.
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
provided
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
shipowner
has
the
minimum
number
required
by
the
coast
guard
for
safe
navigation.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
insofar
as
the
adequacy
of
the
number
of
her
personnel.
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
well
--
may
i
answer
the
question
in
just
a
moment
your
honor.
there
is
a
little
bit
more
to
just
--
than
that
we've
just
complied
with
the
minimum
requirements
because
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
that
in
addition
to
--
the
evidence
wasn't
--
to
an
addition
to
what
the
coast
guard
certificate
of
inspection
required
insofar
as
numbers
of
personnel
were
concerned,
and
that
we
had
i
believe
three
or
four
more
than
the
minimum
number
in
the
deck
department.
then
there
was
testimony
that
of
a
custom
in
the
industry
to
assign
so
many
of
that
number
to
the
aft
docking
station
and
there
was
testimony
amounting
to
a
concession
that
the
number
normally
assigned
to
do
--
to
the
aft
docking
station
were
present
during
the
performance
of
this
docking
operations.
so
we
have
a
little
bit
more
in
this
case
than
mere
compliance
with
coast
guard
regulations.
we
have
compliance
with
coast
guard
regulations
and
custom
of
the
industry.
but
to
try
to
answer
your
honor's
question
of
why,
i
believe
it's
because
of
the
great
number
of
quite
technical
factors
which
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
how
many
men
should
and
have
to
be
as
a
matter
of
law
assigned
to
navigate
a
particular
vessel.
in
other
words,
their
concepts
of
their
construction
concepts,
their
propulsion
concepts,
their
concepts
of
the
trade
in
which
the
vessel
is
in,
their
concepts
of
her
age,
her
deadweight,
the
type
of
cargoes
that
she
carries
and
as
i
say
a
great
many
other
factors
which
result
in
the
use
of
an
etcetera
in
the
regulations
which
the
officer-in-charge,
marine
inspection
must
assemble,
consider,
weigh,
before
he
decides
how
many
should
be
required
aboard
various
classes
of
vessels
engaged
in
various
trades
and
carrying
various
types
of
cargoes.
and
i
believe
that
the
shipowner
ought
to
be
entitled,
to
rely
upon
that
expert
determination
on
the
question
of
whether
his
ship
is
adequately
manned
so
as
to
meet
the
requirements
that
she
need
only
be
reasonably
fit
for
safe
navigation.
in
other
words,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
as
a
matter
of
law
it
ought
to
be
that
a
vessel
that
has
the
coast
guard
compliment
is
reasonably
fit
for
safe
navigation
insofar
only
as
the
number
of
bodies
aboard
ship
are
concerned.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
certainly
wouldn't
concede
your
honor,
but
i
think
i
would
have
to
concede
that
there
was
an
issue
for
jury
determination
as
to
whether
this
assumed
shorthanded
docking
gang,
one
shorthanded
docking
gang
was
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
overall.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
no,
i
think
we
could
get
over
that
even
in
this
case
because
we'll
assume,
if
i
may
that
the
one
short
was
a
(inaudible),
nothing
to
do
with
the
docking
operation,
we'll
assume.
but
certainly,
if
the
one
short
affected
the
number
of
compliment
of
the
aft
docking
station,
then
there
would
i
believe
be
a
question
for
jury
determination
as
to
whether
this
assumed
inadequately
manned
vessel
in
terms
of
numbers
needed
to
perform
this
docking
operation
was
reasonably
fit
for
her
intended
purpose.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
no.
i
think
there'd
still
be
a
question
of
fact
there
if
your
honor
pleases,
as
to
take
the
cook
situation.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
your
honor,
this
question
has
clarified
my
thinking.
i
agree.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
my
--
i
think
was
dealing
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
in
terms
of
approximate
cost
and
that
there
would
be
a
jury
issue
of
whether
the
shortage
of
the
cook
was
a
proximate
cause
of
the
accident.
but
on
the
question
of
whether
the
vessel
unseaworthy,
i
would
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
--
a
ship
which
did
not
have
the
minimum
number
aboard
required
by
the
coast
guard
would
be
unseaworthy.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
yes
sir.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
question
presented
is
whether
with
respect
to
the
number
of
crewmen,
a
vessel
is
reasonably
fit
for
her
intended
service
if
she
has
aboard
more
than
the
number
fixed
by
the
coast
guard
for
her
safe
navigation
pursuant
to
statute.
soon
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
mr.
bamberger
of
the
new
york
times
wrote
sources
on
admiralty
law
expressed
the
view
last
week
that
the
supreme
court
would
establish
a
precedent
of
far
reaching
importance
to
shipowners
if
it
upheld
mr.
waldron.
such
a
decision
may
said,
might
upset
current
manning
scales
if
damage
awards
were
such
as
to
make
it
advisable
for
a
shipowner
to
assign
a
larger
crew
than
is
now
normal
to
ship
port
tasks.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
it's
an
interesting
observation
your
honor
and
i'd
like
to
make
reference
to
a
little
bit
later.
i
think
mr.
bamberger's
wrong
for
reasons
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
put
his
finger
on
a
moment
ago.
now
this
vessel
had
more
than
the
number
of
sailors
required
by
the
coast
guard
officer-in-charge
of
marine
inspection.
there
is
no
claim
that
any
of
those
personnel
were
incompetent.
we
had
a
“very
good”
11-minute
docking
operation.
during
the
course
of
which,
there
was
a
last
minute
decision
by
pier
master
to
put
out
another
spring
line.
the
third
mate
ordered
the
plaintiff
and
another
able
seaman
to
put
that
line
out.
there
was
no
misuse
or
nonuse
of
available
personnel.
the
mate
used
all
of
the
personnel
that
he
had
and
he
had
the
normal
number
at
aft
docking
station.
everyone
was
urgently
engaged
in
performing
other
tasks
connected
with
getting
out
other
lines.
these
two
men,
the
plaintiff
and
another
were
more
or
less
available
and
were
assigned
to
put
out
this
additional
line.
the
jury
found
that
the
mates
order
was
not
negligent.
now
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
but
it
was
slightly
out
of
the
ordinary
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
only
in
that
there
was
testimony
by
plaintiff's
witnesses
who
were
experienced
ship
personnel
that
never
before
in
the
docking
of
this
vessel
had
there
been
any
order
which
required
the
use
of
this
particular
chuck
which
was
some
56
feet
away
from
the
place
where
the
aft
mooring
lines
were
coiled.
it
was
slightly
unusual.
but
to
attempt
to
face
up
to
your
honor's
question,
i
think
the
answer
must
or
should
be
that
if
a
vessel
has
aboard
the
number
required
by
the
coast
guard
for
her
safe
navigation.
and
some
incident,
some
not
unusual
incident
occurs
aboard
vessel
which
requires
assignment
of
some
of
those
personnel
then,
the
only
way,
the
only
theory
upon
which
the
plaintiff
could
recover
would
be
that
the
mate
or
whoever
it
was
who
issued
the
order
was
negligent
in
not
assigning
more
or
conceivably
less
of
the
available
ship's
complement
to
perform
a
particular
task.
now,
under
the
regulations
pursuant
to
statute,
the
officer
in
charge
of
marine
inspection
is
required
to
take
into
consideration
many
factors
in
determining
the
number
of
personnel
required
to
safely
navigate
a
ship.
the
regulations
attempt
to
list
some
of
those
many
factors
and
then
they
run
out
of
gas
and
use
and
et
cetera
to
indicate
the
extensiveness
of
the
factors
which
are
and
must
be
considered
in
determining
the
number
of
personnel
required
to
safely
man
a
vessel.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
there
was
evidence
and
an
admission
by
plaintiff's
expert
that
there
are
at
least
25
common
factors
which
must
be
taken
into
consideration,
weighed,
balanced
and
harmonized
in
determining
how
many
men
should
be
assigned
to
do
any
particular
tasks
during
the
course
of
a
normal
docking
operation.
but
notwithstanding
all
of
these
factors
and
considerations,
plaintiff's
expert
testified
in
vacuo
that
“safe
and
prudent
seamanship”
required
that
three
or
four
men
be
assigned.
be
assigned
to
do
what?
be
assigned
to
carry
or
drag
56-feet
of
brand
new
8-inch
manila
line.
but
the
record
is
perfectly
clear,
if
your
honors
please,
that
even
if
that
expert
testimony
were
valid
and
sufficient
to
raise
some
jury
question,
plaintiff
wasn't
doing
anything
of
that
nature
either
before
or
at
the
time
he
was
hurt.
plaintiff
wasn't
dragging
or
lifting
56-feet
of
line.
what
plaintiff
was
doing
according
to
his
own
testimony
which
appears
at
page
10
of
the
record
was,
he
was
standing
10
feet
away
from
a
coil
of
line
and
he
was
attempting
to
flake
out
of
that
coil
some
additional
line.
and
so
at
most,
the
plaintiff
was
attempting
to
partially
support
10
feet
and
not
56
feet
of
new
8-inch
manila
line.
there
isn't
any
testimony
or
evidence
in
this
case
of
any
unsafe
operation
which
is
a
phrase
frequently
employed
in
the
briefs
by
the
petitioner.
there
wasn't
any
testimony
of
any
custom
to
use
any
additional
personnel
as
is
implied
by
the
brief.
indeed,
the
testimony
is
that
the
plaintiff
with
one
other
had
put
out
two
other
mooring
lines
before
he
was
ordered
to
put
out
this
additional
line.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
you
would
have
most
probably
your
honor
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
cannot
see
any
distinction
there.
i
would
say
if
you
present
one
man
to
do
a
job
of
this
nature,
you
probably
would
have
a
pretty
good
claim
of
negligent
order.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
would
--
that
that
would
convert
this
fully,
confidently,
properly
manned
vessel
into
an
unseaworthy
vessel
because
the
mate
neglected
to
assign
additional
available
personnel
to
perform
the
job.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
cannot
grasp
your
honor's
questions
because
if
he
sends
no
one
the
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
--
the
job
would
not
be
done
i
suppose.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
the
mate
himself,
your
honor?
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
see
no
distinction
under
those
facts
with
your
honor's
former
question.
it
would
amount
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
--
merely
to
a
claim
failure
by
the
mate
to
assign
adequate
number
of
personnel
to
do
the
job.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
indeed,
if
your
honor
pleases,
almost
always
in
these
suits
where
a
claim
is
made
that
additional
personnel
should
have
been
assigned,
the
plaintiff
almost
always
testifies
that
he
protested
to
the
boatswain
or
the
mate
and
asked
for
additional
assistance
but
the
mate
or
the
boatswain
told
him
to
do
it
by
himself.
now
there
of
course
is
no
evidence
or
reasonable
inference
in
this
case
that
this
new
8-inch
manila
mooring
line
was
unseaworthy
or
more
particularly
that
it
was
unseaworthy
unless
three
or
four
men
used
it,
carried
or
dragged
it.
that
i
believe
was
what
redfern
--
apl,
american
president
lines
v.
redfern
was
all
about.
there
was
involved
a
stuck
valve
which
could
only
be
“broken”
by
two
men
or
by
one
man
using
a
particular
sort
of
a
wrench,
spanner
wrench.
one
man
without
wrench
was
sent
down
to
break
the
stuck
valve
and
in
attempting
to
do
so,
he
was
injured.
in
other
words,
as
i
read
redfern
and
as
judge
medina
obviously
read
it,
that
involved
the
case
of
equipment
which
was
unseaworthy
unless
the
additive
of
extra
manpower
or
special
equipment
was
furnished
to
sure,
rectify,
break
the
unseaworthy
condition
and
thereby
make
this
valve
reasonably
fit
for
its
intended
purpose.
now,
were
agreed
that
if
the
question
presented
is
the
one
that
i
first
stated,
it
has
never
been
directly
dealt
with
by
this
court.
in
addition
to
the
decisions
below,
there
are
three
other
lower
court
cases
which
have
dealt
with
the
question.
they're
cited
on
page
7
of
my
brief
and
all
of
them
were
decided
in
favor
of
the
shipowner.
judge
medina
said
and
i
believe
quite
correctly
so,
after
obviously
and
exhaustive
review
of
the
applicable
case
law,
that
there
are
quote
--
there
is
“no
authority
to
the
contrary”
of
the
decision
below.
now
to
get
back
to
mr.
bamberger's
observations,
i
believe
he's
wrong
in
suggesting
that
the
decision
in
this
case
might
impose
upon
shipowners
an
obligation
to
engage
two
or
three
times
as
many
men
to
perform
routine
chores
aboard
ship
as
are
now
engaged
pursuant
to
coast
guard
requirements,
because
that
wouldn't
do
any
good
if
your
honors
please.
if
they
had
a
150
men
on
a
vessel
which
is
now
normally
manned
by
20,
and
for
some
reason,
while
149
of
them
were
standing
around
admiring
the
scenery,
it
became
necessary
to
pick
up
a
bucket
or
a
tool
and
the
mate
assigned
one
of
150
potentially
available
crew
members
to
do
the
job,
that
wouldn't
permit
the
shipowner
to
escape
liability
if
there
were
reversal
in
this
case
because
some
expert
could
always
come
along
and
would
come
along
and
testified
that
two
or
three
or
five
men
were
needed.
so
the
mere
addition
by
the
shipowner
of
vast
hordes
of
unneeded
crewmembers
aboard
vessel
wouldn't
escape
the
consequences
of
reversal
in
this
decision
or
conversely,
if
he
had
a
150
crewmembers
aboard
a
20-crew
ship
and
out
of
extreme
concern
for
the
results
of
a
--
this
decision,
the
mate
assigned
15
men
to
picked
up
the
wrench,
then
of
course
that
decision
would
run
head
on
into
what
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
with
the
expert
testifying
that
this
was
a
job
which
only
one
of
the
150
men
should
have
been
assigned
to
do,
and
the
vessel
became
unseaworthy
because
five
men
were
assigned
to
do
a
one-man
job.
in
other
words,
i
suggest
your
honors
that
reversal
in
this
case
would
make
it
incumbent
upon
the
shipowner
to
attempt,
which
would
be
impossible,
to
see
that
in
every
instance
the
dozens
or
perhaps
hundreds
of
orders
which
are
issued
aboard
ship
each
day,
in
every
case,
the
person
giving
the
order
would
have
to
steer
the
perfect
line
between
assigning
too
few
and
too
many,
and
if
he
didn't,
then
the
vessel
regardless
of
how
many
people
were
aboard
or
available
or
how
competent
they
might
be,
the
shipowner
would
subjected
to
possible
liability
for
unseaworthiness
based
upon
high
insight
testimony
of
an
expert
in
quotes
who
i
suggest
your
honors,
there
isn't
any
deficiency
or
shortage
of
these
people
would
always
be
found
to
testify
that
either
more
or
less
men
should
have
been
assigned
to
do
every
job.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
made
a
motion
for
directive
verdict
on
that
ground
your
honor
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could
have
sustained
on
appeal
a
grant
of
that.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that's
correct
sir.
well,
there
really
wasn't
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
there
was
more
to
it
than
that
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that's
true,
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
because
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
think
juries
are
much
more
capable
of
dealing
with
a
charge
which
is
based
upon
a
claim
of
fault
in
failing
to
conduct
oneself
in
a
reasonably
proper
manner.
then
they
are
in
dealing
with
a
charge
that
regardless
of
any
concept
of
fault
and
regardless
of
how
much
diligence
the
defendant
may
have
exercised
in
an
effort
to
overcome
the
condition,
the
ship
is
still
absolutely
liable
if
the
jury
finds
that
under
these
particular
circumstances,
the
vessel
was
not
reasonably
fit
for
intended
purpose.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
if
the
dolly
breaks
down?
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
would
be
unseaworthy,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
is
not
unseaworthiness,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
with
a
little
additive
if
i
may
your
honor,
if
the
coast
guard
perhaps
had
specified
that
the
dolly
is
of
certain
type
of
spring
and
so
forth
and
in
certain
number
should
be
provided
to
move
a
piece
of
rope
and
the
coast
guard
--
and
the
shipowner
had
complied
with
those
regulations
more
than
100%
then
we
might
perhaps
have
a
different
result
to
the
questions
which
your
honor
has
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
to
a
large
extent,
yes,
your
honor.
and
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
any
of
these
men
was
incompetent.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
well,
they
ran
the
gamut
your
honor
from
--
we
had
ordinaries,
we
had
deck
utility
men,
we
had
able
seaman,
we
had
boatswain,
we
had
a
carpenter,
and
we
had
a
run
of
mates
that
constituted
our
deck
department.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
no,
sir.
there
was
a
mate,
and
i
believe
four
able
seamen
and
one
ordinary.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
normally,
there
were
would
have
been
in
the
aft
a
mate
and
three
able
and
two
ordinary.
but
one
of
the
ordinaries
was
in
the
ship's
hospital,
so
to
replace
him,
they
assigned
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
--
not
only
a
superior
ranking
but
it
turned
out
they
assigned
a
man
who
modestly
testified
that
he
was
the
strongest
and
biggest
and
most
proficient
seaman
on
the
ship.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
exactly.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
intend
to
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
attempted
to
answer,
to
suggest
to
the
court,
and
to
some
extent
deal
with
the
suggestion
that's
been
made
in
the
briefs
that
there
would
be
some
economic
repercussions
from
a
reversal
in
this
case
which
the
shipowner
might
avoid
by
hiring
more
people.
and
i
wanted
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
even
that
further
action
by
the
shipowner
could
not
overcome
the
adverse
consequences
of
the
reversal
in
this
decision
because
no
matter
how
many
people
he
adds,
there
still
comes
the
time
when
somebody
must
assign
a
certain
number
of
those
persons
to
do
a
particular
job,
and
if
a
vessel
is
unseaworthy,
because
of
a
non-negligent
order
assigning
either
too
few
or
as
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
perhaps
too
many
men
to
do
a
particular
job,
then
we
have
a
situation
where
potentially
with
every
order
issued
aboard
vessel,
there
can
be
a
claim
later
made
that
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy
because
the
exact
correct
number
of
persons
were
not
assigned
to
do
the
job.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
unquestionably
so,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
that
is
true
sir.
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
provided
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
shipowner
has
the
minimum
number
required
by
the
coast
guard
for
safe
navigation.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
insofar
as
the
adequacy
of
the
number
of
her
personnel.
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
well
--
may
i
answer
the
question
in
just
a
moment
your
honor.
there
is
a
little
bit
more
to
just
--
than
that
we've
just
complied
with
the
minimum
requirements
because
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
that
in
addition
to
--
the
evidence
wasn't
--
to
an
addition
to
what
the
coast
guard
certificate
of
inspection
required
insofar
as
numbers
of
personnel
were
concerned,
and
that
we
had
i
believe
three
or
four
more
than
the
minimum
number
in
the
deck
department.
then
there
was
testimony
that
of
a
custom
in
the
industry
to
assign
so
many
of
that
number
to
the
aft
docking
station
and
there
was
testimony
amounting
to
a
concession
that
the
number
normally
assigned
to
do
--
to
the
aft
docking
station
were
present
during
the
performance
of
this
docking
operations.
so
we
have
a
little
bit
more
in
this
case
than
mere
compliance
with
coast
guard
regulations.
we
have
compliance
with
coast
guard
regulations
and
custom
of
the
industry.
but
to
try
to
answer
your
honor's
question
of
why,
i
believe
it's
because
of
the
great
number
of
quite
technical
factors
which
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
how
many
men
should
and
have
to
be
as
a
matter
of
law
assigned
to
navigate
a
particular
vessel.
in
other
words,
their
concepts
of
their
construction
concepts,
their
propulsion
concepts,
their
concepts
of
the
trade
in
which
the
vessel
is
in,
their
concepts
of
her
age,
her
deadweight,
the
type
of
cargoes
that
she
carries
and
as
i
say
a
great
many
other
factors
which
result
in
the
use
of
an
etcetera
in
the
regulations
which
the
officer-in-charge,
marine
inspection
must
assemble,
consider,
weigh,
before
he
decides
how
many
should
be
required
aboard
various
classes
of
vessels
engaged
in
various
trades
and
carrying
various
types
of
cargoes.
and
i
believe
that
the
shipowner
ought
to
be
entitled,
to
rely
upon
that
expert
determination
on
the
question
of
whether
his
ship
is
adequately
manned
so
as
to
meet
the
requirements
that
she
need
only
be
reasonably
fit
for
safe
navigation.
in
other
words,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
as
a
matter
of
law
it
ought
to
be
that
a
vessel
that
has
the
coast
guard
compliment
is
reasonably
fit
for
safe
navigation
insofar
only
as
the
number
of
bodies
aboard
ship
are
concerned.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
i
certainly
wouldn't
concede
your
honor,
but
i
think
i
would
have
to
concede
that
there
was
an
issue
for
jury
determination
as
to
whether
this
assumed
shorthanded
docking
gang,
one
shorthanded
docking
gang
was
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
overall.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
no,
i
think
we
could
get
over
that
even
in
this
case
because
we'll
assume,
if
i
may
that
the
one
short
was
a
(inaudible),
nothing
to
do
with
the
docking
operation,
we'll
assume.
but
certainly,
if
the
one
short
affected
the
number
of
compliment
of
the
aft
docking
station,
then
there
would
i
believe
be
a
question
for
jury
determination
as
to
whether
this
assumed
inadequately
manned
vessel
in
terms
of
numbers
needed
to
perform
this
docking
operation
was
reasonably
fit
for
her
intended
purpose.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
no.
i
think
there'd
still
be
a
question
of
fact
there
if
your
honor
pleases,
as
to
take
the
cook
situation.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
your
honor,
this
question
has
clarified
my
thinking.
i
agree.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
my
--
i
think
was
dealing
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
in
terms
of
approximate
cost
and
that
there
would
be
a
jury
issue
of
whether
the
shortage
of
the
cook
was
a
proximate
cause
of
the
accident.
but
on
the
question
of
whether
the
vessel
unseaworthy,
i
would
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
william
m.
kimball
--
a
ship
which
did
not
have
the
minimum
number
aboard
required
by
the
coast
guard
would
be
unseaworthy.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
kimball
yes
sir.
thank
you
your
honors.
