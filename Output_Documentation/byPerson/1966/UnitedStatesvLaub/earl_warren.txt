do
you
proceed
first
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
this
one
mr.
boudin?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewin,
if
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
answer
--
could
you
respond
to
what
mr.
mcternan
just
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
might
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
alright.
take
both
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
its
clear
there's
a
--
it
wouldn't
depart
very
far
from
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
that
mean
that
the
government
because
the
--
of
the
ambiguity
of
a
statute,
i
mean,
interpretation
of
it
thought
that
it
didn't
this
one
necessary
to
be
proved
and
didn't
undertake
to
do
it
that
we
should
let
the
government
retry
this
person
and
supply
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
that
--
there
is
that
ambiguity
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
don't
you
think
that
there
might
be
like
ambiguity
so
far
as
the
responsibility
of
the
defendant
is
concern?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
also
that
consider
couldn't
we
that
mr.
mcternan
was
interested
in
his
one
client
and
wanted
to
make
a
stipulation
that
on
the
facts
that
they
were
so,
his
client
wouldn't
be
convicted.
on
the
other
hand,
you
want
to
bring
this
case
to
this
court
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
principle
on
your
theory
of
the
act,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
add
you
through
the
years
then
prosecuting
in
this
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
for
great
many
years
you
had
never
adopted
this
theory
and
had
never
used
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
you
--
what
do
you
think
of
the
press
in
eisenhower,
a
special
message
to
the
congress
to
requesting
that
clear
statutory
authority
to
prevent
americans
from
using
passports
for
travel
to
areas
where
there's
no
means
of
protecting
them
or
where
they're
presence
would
conflict
with
our
foreign
policy
objectives
are
being
amicable
both
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
should
be
passed.
that's
--
that
was
after
kent
versus
dulles
and
that
--
and
the
congress
didn't
pass
any
such
laws
nor
have
they
since?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
do
you
think
of
that
so
far
as
understanding
of
the
effect
of
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
president
--
did
the
president
point
that
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
department
of
state
point
out
to
the
congress
that
that's
what
they
wanted
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
wanted
to
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
flood
those
loopholes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
won't
you
think
it
was
rather
important
if
you
relied
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
help,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
think
that
the
president
when
he
sent
this
message
to
congress
was
speaking
the
minds
of
the
state
department?
