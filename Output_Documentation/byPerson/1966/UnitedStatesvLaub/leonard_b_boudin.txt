mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
my
apologies
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
so
custom
to
being
the
appellant
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
my
brief
argument
in
chief,
i
do
want
to
make
reference
to
what
counsel
has
just
said.
it
appears
here
that
a
good
part
of
his
case
depends
upon
the
construction
of
section
1544
with
which
none
of
us
here
have
been
prosecuted.
and
it
appears
also
that
the
persons
who
have
the
greatest
knowledge
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
presumably
a
correct
knowledge
that
the
statute
is
not
applicable
could
avoid
prosecution
and
that
those
who
like
the
defendants
in
these
cases
who
don't
have
the
expertise
as
counsel
has
suggested
should
be
subject
to
prosecution.
the
fact
is
that
everybody
in
authority
in
the
state
department
and
i
mean
everybody
that
our
briefs
will
show
has
agreed
that
section
215
is
not
applicable
to
area
restrictions.
and
that
the
area
restriction
provision
comes
under
a
different
heading
of
the
state
department's
power,
the
power
of
the
foreign
relation.
and
that
this
view
which
has
been
expressed
by
chiefs
of
the
legal
division
of
the
passport
office
and
we
have
cited
by
the
directors
of
the
bureau
of
security
and
consular
affairs
whom
we
have
cited
is
uniform.
and
i
may
say
has
been
subscribed
to
by
another
great
solicitor
general,
one
who
argued
kent
against
dulles
who
said
in
talking
about
passport
restrictions,
and
i'm
from
reading
his
brief
which
we
have
cited
that
this
restriction,
the
power
to
impose
area
restrictions
would
carry
no
sanctions,
i
repeat,
no
sanctions.
since
the
statute
referring
to
section
215
or
1188
makes
it
unlawful
only
to
depart
or
enter
the
country
without
a
lawful
passport.
and
i
may
say
that
--
some
urge
we
cease
the
controversy,
allow
the
controversy
between
the
defendant
and
the
government
is
really
a
basic
controversy
between
the
state
department
and
the
internal
security
division
of
the
department
of
justice
because
the
state
department
knowing
of
the
600
old
law
cases
over
the
years
has
never
suggested
so
far
as
the
record
show
a
single
prosecution
and
it
was
only
until
the
cuba
problem
arose
that
a
prosecution
was
decided
upon.
now,
we
are
here
for
the
third
time
in
eight
years
arguing
the
meaning
of
1185.
and
the
only
difference
between
this
case
and
the
others
is
that
we're
here
confronted
with
a
criminal
proceeding
which
the
problems
are
the
construction
of
a
statute,
a
so
much
serious
and
so
much
more
obvious.
although
what
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
kent
against
dulles
cast
--
light
upon
this
because
he
recognized
the
nature
of
the
statute
as
one
involving
an
impairment
of
civil
liberties
and
also
the
fact
that
it
was
a
criminal
statute.
now,
bearing
in
mind
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
how
does
the
government
which
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
this
statute
not
1544
is
applicable
to
these
clients.
how
does
the
government
treat
this
important
problem?
it
says
with
respect
to
the
statute
upon
which
it
relies
in
this
case,
215
(b),
that's
1188
does
not
in
so
many
words,
i
thought
words
were
what
governed
that
is
not
in
so
many
words
prohibit
violations
of
area
restrictions.
and
it
says
in
another
place
in
his
brief,
i
won't
take
the
time
to
give
the
pages
up
since
they're
all
in
my
brief
and
in
the
government's
brief.
section
215
(b)
was
not
as
explicit
in
prohibiting
violations
of
area
restrictions
as
it
might
be.
it's
not
a
diplomatic
problem.
this
is
not
a
letter
of
introduction.
this
is
a
criminal
statute
we
have
here.
well,
let
us
suppose
that
the
statute
is
not
clear
and
let
us
assume
although
i
think
its
not
proper
in
a
criminal
statute
that
the
government
can
turn
to
legislative
history
thus
rely
upon
it.
how
does
it
describe
the
legislative
history
which
is
voluminous
i
may
say?
it
describes
it
at
his
brief
at
page
20
as
amici.
well,
perhaps
legislative
history
is
missing,
can
the
government
show
a
different
purpose
from
other
evidence.
no,
the
government
says,
the
debates
do
not
show
and
i
quote,
"any
awareness
of
the
problem,
the
problem
of
area
restrictions",
has
it
ever
occurred
to
the
government
that
the
debates
don't
show
any
awareness
because
this
is
not
the
problem
with
which
congress
was
concerned
in
1918
and
in
1941
when
this
whole
matter
was
debated
fully.
well,
let
us
assume
that
all
these
tests
are
wrong
and
we
must
turn
to
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute
though
i
would
not
of
course
agree
that
absent,
legislative
support,
even
the
state
department
could
admit
it
to
the
statute
in
a
way
contrary
to
law.
as
to
section
215
(b),
what
does
the
government
say?
it
says
215
(b),
it
says
the
department
has
not
called
this
application,
this
criminal
application
they're
talking
about,
to
public
attention
as
much
as
it
might
have.
and
state
department
officials
have
occasionally,
i
say
uniformly,
have
occasionally
suggested
that
no
criminal
sanctions
lie
behind
the
secretary's
area
restrictions.
and
as
to
the
press
release
of
may
1952
which
the
chief
justice
adverted
upon
which
the
bar
association
made
a
comment
and
i
may
say
that
the
bar
association
had
a
committee,
had
as
a
member
mr.
adrian
fisher
who
was
legal
adviser
previously
to
the
state
department
and
is
a
well-known
scholar
in
this
field.
after
this
press
release
issued
by
the
department
of
state,
the
government
describes
it
as
quote,
"somewhat
ambiguous".
and
by
the
way
counsel
is
wrong
when
that
press
release
was
issued
in
1952,
there
were
in
effect
still
the
act
of
9
--
the
provisions
of
the
act
was
1941
as
continued
by
congress
until
the
immigration
act
could
be
passed.
and
as
to
the
testimony
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief
of
all
of
the
department
officials
testifying
on
the
subject
of
area
restrictions,
what
does
the
department
of
justice
say
about
the
departmental
officials
from
the
state
department
who
were
authorized
to
enforce
and
to
implement
and
to
administer
this
passport
law
plainly
unsound.
now,
we
don't
have
to
rely
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
plainly
unsound
at
page
36
is
what
the
department
of
justice
says
in
its
brief
as
to
the
department
of
state's
view
that
area
restrictions
are
not
enforceable
criminally.
and
of
course
it
is
the
department
of
state
that
is
supposed
to
administer
passport
laws
and
to
put
valid
or
not
valid
or
restricted
stance
in
passports.
i
suppose
and
since
it's
a
criminal
case
i
could
rest
upon
what
the
admission,
about
the
admissions
made
by
the
government
but
the
admissions
are
made
because
there
is
voluminous
evidence
to
support
us
in
this
statute.
there
is
a
language
of
the
statute,
a
statute
that
talks
about
departing
and
entering,
referring
to
the
borders
of
the
united
states,
not
the
borders
of
cuba
or
china.
there
is
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
always
been
able
to
write
a
clear
statute
when
they
wanted
to
prevent
people
from
going
to
particular
areas
and
we
have
referred
to
a
number
of
instances
in
our
brief
which
i
will
burden
the
court
with
now
which
when
congress
said,
"we
don't
want
you
to
go
to
indian
territory,
it
said
indian
territory",
when
it
said,
"we
don't
want
you
to
go
into
enemy
territory",
it
said
enemy
territory.
we
don't
have
to
look
to
the
past
to
find
the
ability
of
congress
which
is
perfectly
obvious
to
meet
the
problem
if
there
is
a
problem.
the
bills
which
have
been
proposed
since
1957
beginning
with
the
bill
proposed
by
the
commission
on
government's
security
with
congress
and
walter
was
a
member.
the
proposals
made
by
the
president,
president
eisenhower
and
by
secretary
of
state
dulles,
the
proposals
which
were
made
as
recently
as
a
few
months
ago
by
the
department
itself
from
the
hayes
bill
to
which
had
--
the
attention
of
the
court
was
called
yesterday
by
mr.
mcternan.
all
of
these
bills
state
very
clearly
in
two
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
substance
of
the
66
bill
as
proposed
by
the
department
of
state
introduced
by
mr.
hayes
is
that
the
secretary
of
state
with
the
approval
of
the
president
can
make
it
unlawful,
can
declare
certain
areas
out
of
bounds.
and
that
a
violation
of
those
restrictions
is
then
criminal.
that
is
proposed
by
a
revision
of
the
passport
laws
which
is
consistent
with
the
department's
theory
that
area
restrictions
don't
involve
national
security
but
involve
foreign
affairs,
political
matters
and
so
forth.
in
contrast,
there
is
an
equally
explicit
bill,
mr.
justice
harlan
which
goes
to
another
line
of
authority
and
that
is
an
amendment
of
section
215,
that
is
an
amendment
of
the
very
statute
we're
talking
about
which
would
make
explicit
a
violation
of
area
restriction
and
this
is
the
proposal
that
from
1957
to
date
has
been
made
by
a
large
number
of
congressmen
so
that
--
sorry.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
those
bills
are
referred
to
in
mr.
mcternan's
brief
and
in
my
brief.
now,
we
have
set
forth
the
legislative
history
of
section
1188
and
the
predecessor
bills
in
our
brief.
i
cannot
take
the
short
time
i
have
to
develop
but
let
me
say
that
i
owe
again
a
great
debt
to
the
solicitor
general,
mr.
rankin
who
developed
this
whole
legislative
history
fully
intent
against
dulles
in
his
brief.
we
have
again
put
it
in
out
brief
here
and
it's
in
the
brief
in
zemel.
and
what
it
shows
essentially
is
that
the
united
states
government
upon
the
suggestion
of
president
wilson
in
1917
was
concerned
not
about
what
might
happen
in
terms
of
american
citizen
being
injured
abroad,
a
conflagration
there.
the
stuff
that
is
now
talked
about
these
modern
days
when
we
try
to
rewrite
a
statute
what
president
wilson
was
concerned
about
and
that
congress
misspoke
of
1918
and
1941
was
to
seal
the
borders
of
the
united
states
against
aliens,
neutral
aliens
who
may
suspected
by
--
be
crossing
to
commit
sabotage
and
espionage
and
against
american
citizens.
and
repeatedly
in
this
meager
legislative
history
as
it
was
referred
to
we
have
references
to
espionage,
subversive
activity,
ingress
and
egress
not
a
word
it
said
about
area
restrictions.
not
a
word
and
this
is
again
an
example
of
a
tail
--
wagging
the
dog
it
was
referred
to
but
in
another
sentence
by
mr.
justice
black
yesterday
when
the
government
refers
to
the
instance
of
canada
as
a
sort
of
area
restriction
because
another
country
has
been
named,
it
assumes
as
an
area
restriction,
that
was
not
a
restriction.
that
was
for
the
purpose
of
being
sure
that
canada
could
be
treated
that
it
was
part
of
the
united
states,
a
non-restriction
so
that
american
could
go
across
the
border
without
having
any
passport
not
with
having
passport
validated
for
travel
for
canada,
without
having
any
passport
at
all.
now,
i've
indicated
in
our
brief,
the
absurd
results
that
was
followed
from
the
government's
attempt
to
change
this
statute
into
an
area
control
statute.
one
example
is
this,
a
man
leaves
the
united
states
intending
to
go
to
cuba.
he
commits
the
crime
when
he
passes
the
border
of
the
united
states
if
you
adopt
their
construction
of
the
statute.
the
man
however
doesn't
want
to
go
to
cuba
but
he
goes
to
france
and
while
on
france
he
decides
to
cause
his
great
conflagration
by
going
to
cuba
himself
and
giving
the
secretary
of
state
all
these
problems.
he
goes
to
cuba.
no
problem
at
all.
well,
its
--
this
is
only
a
little
example
of
how
absurd
the
whole
situation
is
because
you
are
attempting
to
take
a
statute
intended
for
one
purpose
and
put
it
into
another.
this
whole
question
of
the
needing
of
term
valid
of
course
no
matter
what
they
--
we
say
or
they
say
about
what
valid
means
we
have
to
consider
valid
as
to
what.
now
a
--
that
a
passport
is
valid
within
the
extreme
of
cases
going
under
211
(a)
or
22
u.s.c.
valid
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
letter
of
introductions
then
discussed.
it
was
the
old
conception
of
the
passport.
it's
not
dead,
happens
not
to
be
practically
as
important
as
the
exit
and
entry
one.
and
from
that
point
of
view
a
passport
is
valid
or
invalid.
but
when
we
are
talking
about
a
valid
passport
within
the
meaning
of
a
departure
and
entry
statute
we
mean
valid
for
the
purpose
of
crossing
the
american
border,
that's
what
valid
means.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
the
construction
given
by
the
department
itself
in
the
passport
handbook
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
says
that
validity
--
i'm
paraphrasing,
refers
to
the
duration
of
the
passport.
and
your
honors
will
recall
that
when
before
the
senate
committee
on
security
and
consular
affairs,
passport
officials
were
asked
what
the
meaning
of
the
term
"valid"
was,
what
was
their
answer?
said
the
chief-of-the-legal
division
as
he
then
was,
"well,
in
effect
that
says
this
government
is
not
sponsoring
the
entry
of
the
individual
into
those
countries
and
does
not
response
to
the
entry
of
the
individual
into
those
countries
and
does
not
give
him
permission
to
go
in
there
under
the
protection
of
the
united
states".
not
a
word
about
criminal
prosecutions
that
i
must
that
the
line
that
has
been
read
here
really
does
not
represent
in
my
view
ascriptions
as
the
departmental
official,
a
fair
reading.
i
can
find
nothing
in
this
volume
or
anything
else
supporting
the
government's
construction
because
it
was
not
the
construction
of
the
state
department
and
never
has
been.
and
as
the
present
acting
bureau
later
bureau
director
of
the
bureau
of
security
and
consular
affairs
pointed
out
from
his
point
of
view,
we've
cited
it,
it's
in
our
brief,
passport
validity
and
restrictions
all
relate
to
this
subject
of
foreign
affairs
under
the
211
(a)
problem
not
under
the
departing
and
entering
concept.
now,
we
come
to
the
administrative
implementation
of
a
statute
and
as
to
that
as
we
show
your
honors
never
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
or
its
predecessor
statutes
of
1918
and
1941
was
there
ever
a
proclamation,
an
executive
order,
a
state
departmental
regulation
referring
to
area
restrictions
authorizing
area
restrictions
that
of
course
we
know
taking
the
other
side
of
the
coin
never
when
area
restrictions
were
imposed
by
the
secretary
of
state
where
they
impose
except
under
the
heading
of
an
alleged
injuring
power
or
a
passport
act
where
there
was
a
--
an
act
of
1926
or
a
prior
act.
these
are
the
two
lines
which
have
to
be
kept
into
consideration
in
analyzing
what
we're
talking
about.
now,
i
pass
over
the
various
statements
that
have
been
made
by
the
department.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
even
in
zemel
in
the
district
court
as
the
record
at
--
record
63
will
show
your
honors,
the
government's
position,
the
department
of
justice's
position
was
that
the
area
restrictions
were
under
211
(a)
and
not
under
1185,
the
statute
involved
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
need
for
a
legislation
let
me
say
a
word,
of
course
a
proposal
that
has
been
made
by
a
governmental
department
doesn't
prove,
it
doesn't
have
the
power.
but
what
shall
say
here
when
there
has
been
this
avalanche
of
proposals
made
by
the
department
of
state
and
by
congressmen,
sympathetic
with
it
or
not
sympathetic
with
it
to
give
the
department
of
state
this
particular
kind
of
power.
i
don't
understand
the
explanation
as
been
given
that
perhaps
somebody
thought
the
department
had
the
power
or
perhaps
they
disagreed
with
the
extent
of
the
power
that
the
department
wanted
because
the
bills
were
sufficiently
varied
to
take
into
consideration
every
possible
contingency.
the
fact
is
and
this
is
one
of
the
interesting
facts
of
life
that
despite
the
foreboding
of
the
department
of
justice
in
kent
against
dulles,
the
department
never,
the
--
was
able
to
get
the
authority
to
turn
kent
against
dulles
back
although
clearly
the
department
doesn't
have
the
power
to
deny
passports,
the
people
on
political
grounds.
and
so
here,
the
department
has
not
been
able
to
persuade
congress
to
give
it
this
power
now
sought
for
nine
years.
we
think
that
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case
is
applicable.
this
practical
construction
of
the
act
by
those
entrusted
with
its
administration
is
reinforced
by
the
administration.
i'm
paraphrasing
one
word,
unsuccessful
attempt
to
secure
from
congress
an
expressed
grant
of
authority.
and
that
explains
not
inadequacy
in
writing
a
brief,
that
explains
why
we
have
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
because
this
is
all
there
is.
the
government
is
unable
candidly
to
find
anything
in
this
statute
which
would
justify
its
application
and
i
think
even
in
the
civil
statute
talking
about
1185.
now,
this
construction
the
government
seeks
is
of
course
also,
one,
which
would
pose
directly
the
questions
put
by
mr.
justice
black
namely,
"is
the
statute
a
clear
statute
and
where
are
the
legislative
standards?"
i
take
from
my
authority
if
your
honors
who
have
seen
throughout
this
argument
the
department
of
state
and
i
think
that
what
mr.
philip
heymann,
the
present
acting
director
of
the
bureau
of
security
and
consular
affairs
and
a
well-known
scholar
said
very
candidly
that
the
department
isn't
interested
in
problems
of
litigation
but
in
getting
things
done
and
in
stating
the
problems
fairly
to
the
congress.
what
mr.
heymann
said
in
the
hearings
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
is
we
agree
with
the
need
to
provide
clear
statutory
authority
for
the
imposition
of
necessary
area
restrictions
and
appropriate
enforcement
provisions.
and
he
said,
in
the
present
view
held
either
before
or
after
that.
in
other
words,
right
now
we
have
broadly
worded
authority
to
do
whatever
we
want
and
very
sloppy
statutory
authority
to
enforce
what
we
do.
well,
i
think
it
has
been
demonstrated
by
all
of
counsel
here
that
the
authority
is
so
broadly
worded
as
to
be
meaningless
if
we
are
to
interpret
1185
as
the
government
suggest
and
mr.
heymann
never
suggested
1185
to
be
used
here
and
obviously
to
say
that
there
are
sloppy
statutory
authorities
to
enforce
what
we
want
here
is
equally
appropriate.
and
mr.
heymann
then
addressed
himself
to
the
second
problem
that
was
discussed
here
by
mr.
mcternan,
the
questions
of
standards
because
we
are
dealing
here,
if
the
court
pleases
with
an
act
as
i
think
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
by
an
undersecretary
of
state
for
administration
and
i
may
say
the
new
regulations
that
came
down
a
short
while
ago
that
we
referred
yesterday
by
a
deputy,
undersecretary
of
state
for
administration.
so
we're
moving
down
the
ladder
now
as
we
regulate
the
conduct
of
citizens
suppose
to
affect
their
criminal
status.
mr.
heymann
said
on
the
subject,
as
you
know
the
secretary's
authority
to
restrict
travel
has
until
now
been
exercised
without
any
legislative
enacted
standards
and
required
procedures.
one
of
the
important
purposes
of
the
proposed
state
department
bill
is
to
provide
congressional
standards
for
the
restriction
of
travel.
well,
i
suggest
that
until
we
have
carried
out
mr.
heymann's
proposal
and
have
a
statute
that
is
precise
and
had
one
that
has
standards
and
until
we
have
had
a
statute
that
is
clear
and
there
has
some
legislative
history
behind
it
to
support
the
government
rather
than
this
multiplicity
of
evidence
against
it
that
the
prosecutions
could
wait.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
my
apologies
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
so
custom
to
being
the
appellant
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
my
brief
argument
in
chief,
i
do
want
to
make
reference
to
what
counsel
has
just
said.
it
appears
here
that
a
good
part
of
his
case
depends
upon
the
construction
of
section
1544
with
which
none
of
us
here
have
been
prosecuted.
and
it
appears
also
that
the
persons
who
have
the
greatest
knowledge
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
presumably
a
correct
knowledge
that
the
statute
is
not
applicable
could
avoid
prosecution
and
that
those
who
like
the
defendants
in
these
cases
who
don't
have
the
expertise
as
counsel
has
suggested
should
be
subject
to
prosecution.
the
fact
is
that
everybody
in
authority
in
the
state
department
and
i
mean
everybody
that
our
briefs
will
show
has
agreed
that
section
215
is
not
applicable
to
area
restrictions.
and
that
the
area
restriction
provision
comes
under
a
different
heading
of
the
state
department's
power,
the
power
of
the
foreign
relation.
and
that
this
view
which
has
been
expressed
by
chiefs
of
the
legal
division
of
the
passport
office
and
we
have
cited
by
the
directors
of
the
bureau
of
security
and
consular
affairs
whom
we
have
cited
is
uniform.
and
i
may
say
has
been
subscribed
to
by
another
great
solicitor
general,
one
who
argued
kent
against
dulles
who
said
in
talking
about
passport
restrictions,
and
i'm
from
reading
his
brief
which
we
have
cited
that
this
restriction,
the
power
to
impose
area
restrictions
would
carry
no
sanctions,
i
repeat,
no
sanctions.
since
the
statute
referring
to
section
215
or
1188
makes
it
unlawful
only
to
depart
or
enter
the
country
without
a
lawful
passport.
and
i
may
say
that
--
some
urge
we
cease
the
controversy,
allow
the
controversy
between
the
defendant
and
the
government
is
really
a
basic
controversy
between
the
state
department
and
the
internal
security
division
of
the
department
of
justice
because
the
state
department
knowing
of
the
600
old
law
cases
over
the
years
has
never
suggested
so
far
as
the
record
show
a
single
prosecution
and
it
was
only
until
the
cuba
problem
arose
that
a
prosecution
was
decided
upon.
now,
we
are
here
for
the
third
time
in
eight
years
arguing
the
meaning
of
1185.
and
the
only
difference
between
this
case
and
the
others
is
that
we're
here
confronted
with
a
criminal
proceeding
which
the
problems
are
the
construction
of
a
statute,
a
so
much
serious
and
so
much
more
obvious.
although
what
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
kent
against
dulles
cast
--
light
upon
this
because
he
recognized
the
nature
of
the
statute
as
one
involving
an
impairment
of
civil
liberties
and
also
the
fact
that
it
was
a
criminal
statute.
now,
bearing
in
mind
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
how
does
the
government
which
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
this
statute
not
1544
is
applicable
to
these
clients.
how
does
the
government
treat
this
important
problem?
it
says
with
respect
to
the
statute
upon
which
it
relies
in
this
case,
215
(b),
that's
1188
does
not
in
so
many
words,
i
thought
words
were
what
governed
that
is
not
in
so
many
words
prohibit
violations
of
area
restrictions.
and
it
says
in
another
place
in
his
brief,
i
won't
take
the
time
to
give
the
pages
up
since
they're
all
in
my
brief
and
in
the
government's
brief.
section
215
(b)
was
not
as
explicit
in
prohibiting
violations
of
area
restrictions
as
it
might
be.
it's
not
a
diplomatic
problem.
this
is
not
a
letter
of
introduction.
this
is
a
criminal
statute
we
have
here.
well,
let
us
suppose
that
the
statute
is
not
clear
and
let
us
assume
although
i
think
its
not
proper
in
a
criminal
statute
that
the
government
can
turn
to
legislative
history
thus
rely
upon
it.
how
does
it
describe
the
legislative
history
which
is
voluminous
i
may
say?
it
describes
it
at
his
brief
at
page
20
as
amici.
well,
perhaps
legislative
history
is
missing,
can
the
government
show
a
different
purpose
from
other
evidence.
no,
the
government
says,
the
debates
do
not
show
and
i
quote,
"any
awareness
of
the
problem,
the
problem
of
area
restrictions",
has
it
ever
occurred
to
the
government
that
the
debates
don't
show
any
awareness
because
this
is
not
the
problem
with
which
congress
was
concerned
in
1918
and
in
1941
when
this
whole
matter
was
debated
fully.
well,
let
us
assume
that
all
these
tests
are
wrong
and
we
must
turn
to
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute
though
i
would
not
of
course
agree
that
absent,
legislative
support,
even
the
state
department
could
admit
it
to
the
statute
in
a
way
contrary
to
law.
as
to
section
215
(b),
what
does
the
government
say?
it
says
215
(b),
it
says
the
department
has
not
called
this
application,
this
criminal
application
they're
talking
about,
to
public
attention
as
much
as
it
might
have.
and
state
department
officials
have
occasionally,
i
say
uniformly,
have
occasionally
suggested
that
no
criminal
sanctions
lie
behind
the
secretary's
area
restrictions.
and
as
to
the
press
release
of
may
1952
which
the
chief
justice
adverted
upon
which
the
bar
association
made
a
comment
and
i
may
say
that
the
bar
association
had
a
committee,
had
as
a
member
mr.
adrian
fisher
who
was
legal
adviser
previously
to
the
state
department
and
is
a
well-known
scholar
in
this
field.
after
this
press
release
issued
by
the
department
of
state,
the
government
describes
it
as
quote,
"somewhat
ambiguous".
and
by
the
way
counsel
is
wrong
when
that
press
release
was
issued
in
1952,
there
were
in
effect
still
the
act
of
9
--
the
provisions
of
the
act
was
1941
as
continued
by
congress
until
the
immigration
act
could
be
passed.
and
as
to
the
testimony
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief
of
all
of
the
department
officials
testifying
on
the
subject
of
area
restrictions,
what
does
the
department
of
justice
say
about
the
departmental
officials
from
the
state
department
who
were
authorized
to
enforce
and
to
implement
and
to
administer
this
passport
law
plainly
unsound.
now,
we
don't
have
to
rely
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
plainly
unsound
at
page
36
is
what
the
department
of
justice
says
in
its
brief
as
to
the
department
of
state's
view
that
area
restrictions
are
not
enforceable
criminally.
and
of
course
it
is
the
department
of
state
that
is
supposed
to
administer
passport
laws
and
to
put
valid
or
not
valid
or
restricted
stance
in
passports.
i
suppose
and
since
it's
a
criminal
case
i
could
rest
upon
what
the
admission,
about
the
admissions
made
by
the
government
but
the
admissions
are
made
because
there
is
voluminous
evidence
to
support
us
in
this
statute.
there
is
a
language
of
the
statute,
a
statute
that
talks
about
departing
and
entering,
referring
to
the
borders
of
the
united
states,
not
the
borders
of
cuba
or
china.
there
is
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
always
been
able
to
write
a
clear
statute
when
they
wanted
to
prevent
people
from
going
to
particular
areas
and
we
have
referred
to
a
number
of
instances
in
our
brief
which
i
will
burden
the
court
with
now
which
when
congress
said,
"we
don't
want
you
to
go
to
indian
territory,
it
said
indian
territory",
when
it
said,
"we
don't
want
you
to
go
into
enemy
territory",
it
said
enemy
territory.
we
don't
have
to
look
to
the
past
to
find
the
ability
of
congress
which
is
perfectly
obvious
to
meet
the
problem
if
there
is
a
problem.
the
bills
which
have
been
proposed
since
1957
beginning
with
the
bill
proposed
by
the
commission
on
government's
security
with
congress
and
walter
was
a
member.
the
proposals
made
by
the
president,
president
eisenhower
and
by
secretary
of
state
dulles,
the
proposals
which
were
made
as
recently
as
a
few
months
ago
by
the
department
itself
from
the
hayes
bill
to
which
had
--
the
attention
of
the
court
was
called
yesterday
by
mr.
mcternan.
all
of
these
bills
state
very
clearly
in
two
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
substance
of
the
66
bill
as
proposed
by
the
department
of
state
introduced
by
mr.
hayes
is
that
the
secretary
of
state
with
the
approval
of
the
president
can
make
it
unlawful,
can
declare
certain
areas
out
of
bounds.
and
that
a
violation
of
those
restrictions
is
then
criminal.
that
is
proposed
by
a
revision
of
the
passport
laws
which
is
consistent
with
the
department's
theory
that
area
restrictions
don't
involve
national
security
but
involve
foreign
affairs,
political
matters
and
so
forth.
in
contrast,
there
is
an
equally
explicit
bill,
mr.
justice
harlan
which
goes
to
another
line
of
authority
and
that
is
an
amendment
of
section
215,
that
is
an
amendment
of
the
very
statute
we're
talking
about
which
would
make
explicit
a
violation
of
area
restriction
and
this
is
the
proposal
that
from
1957
to
date
has
been
made
by
a
large
number
of
congressmen
so
that
--
sorry.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
those
bills
are
referred
to
in
mr.
mcternan's
brief
and
in
my
brief.
now,
we
have
set
forth
the
legislative
history
of
section
1188
and
the
predecessor
bills
in
our
brief.
i
cannot
take
the
short
time
i
have
to
develop
but
let
me
say
that
i
owe
again
a
great
debt
to
the
solicitor
general,
mr.
rankin
who
developed
this
whole
legislative
history
fully
intent
against
dulles
in
his
brief.
we
have
again
put
it
in
out
brief
here
and
it's
in
the
brief
in
zemel.
and
what
it
shows
essentially
is
that
the
united
states
government
upon
the
suggestion
of
president
wilson
in
1917
was
concerned
not
about
what
might
happen
in
terms
of
american
citizen
being
injured
abroad,
a
conflagration
there.
the
stuff
that
is
now
talked
about
these
modern
days
when
we
try
to
rewrite
a
statute
what
president
wilson
was
concerned
about
and
that
congress
misspoke
of
1918
and
1941
was
to
seal
the
borders
of
the
united
states
against
aliens,
neutral
aliens
who
may
suspected
by
--
be
crossing
to
commit
sabotage
and
espionage
and
against
american
citizens.
and
repeatedly
in
this
meager
legislative
history
as
it
was
referred
to
we
have
references
to
espionage,
subversive
activity,
ingress
and
egress
not
a
word
it
said
about
area
restrictions.
not
a
word
and
this
is
again
an
example
of
a
tail
--
wagging
the
dog
it
was
referred
to
but
in
another
sentence
by
mr.
justice
black
yesterday
when
the
government
refers
to
the
instance
of
canada
as
a
sort
of
area
restriction
because
another
country
has
been
named,
it
assumes
as
an
area
restriction,
that
was
not
a
restriction.
that
was
for
the
purpose
of
being
sure
that
canada
could
be
treated
that
it
was
part
of
the
united
states,
a
non-restriction
so
that
american
could
go
across
the
border
without
having
any
passport
not
with
having
passport
validated
for
travel
for
canada,
without
having
any
passport
at
all.
now,
i've
indicated
in
our
brief,
the
absurd
results
that
was
followed
from
the
government's
attempt
to
change
this
statute
into
an
area
control
statute.
one
example
is
this,
a
man
leaves
the
united
states
intending
to
go
to
cuba.
he
commits
the
crime
when
he
passes
the
border
of
the
united
states
if
you
adopt
their
construction
of
the
statute.
the
man
however
doesn't
want
to
go
to
cuba
but
he
goes
to
france
and
while
on
france
he
decides
to
cause
his
great
conflagration
by
going
to
cuba
himself
and
giving
the
secretary
of
state
all
these
problems.
he
goes
to
cuba.
no
problem
at
all.
well,
its
--
this
is
only
a
little
example
of
how
absurd
the
whole
situation
is
because
you
are
attempting
to
take
a
statute
intended
for
one
purpose
and
put
it
into
another.
this
whole
question
of
the
needing
of
term
valid
of
course
no
matter
what
they
--
we
say
or
they
say
about
what
valid
means
we
have
to
consider
valid
as
to
what.
now
a
--
that
a
passport
is
valid
within
the
extreme
of
cases
going
under
211
(a)
or
22
u.s.c.
valid
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
letter
of
introductions
then
discussed.
it
was
the
old
conception
of
the
passport.
it's
not
dead,
happens
not
to
be
practically
as
important
as
the
exit
and
entry
one.
and
from
that
point
of
view
a
passport
is
valid
or
invalid.
but
when
we
are
talking
about
a
valid
passport
within
the
meaning
of
a
departure
and
entry
statute
we
mean
valid
for
the
purpose
of
crossing
the
american
border,
that's
what
valid
means.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
the
construction
given
by
the
department
itself
in
the
passport
handbook
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
says
that
validity
--
i'm
paraphrasing,
refers
to
the
duration
of
the
passport.
and
your
honors
will
recall
that
when
before
the
senate
committee
on
security
and
consular
affairs,
passport
officials
were
asked
what
the
meaning
of
the
term
"valid"
was,
what
was
their
answer?
said
the
chief-of-the-legal
division
as
he
then
was,
"well,
in
effect
that
says
this
government
is
not
sponsoring
the
entry
of
the
individual
into
those
countries
and
does
not
response
to
the
entry
of
the
individual
into
those
countries
and
does
not
give
him
permission
to
go
in
there
under
the
protection
of
the
united
states".
not
a
word
about
criminal
prosecutions
that
i
must
that
the
line
that
has
been
read
here
really
does
not
represent
in
my
view
ascriptions
as
the
departmental
official,
a
fair
reading.
i
can
find
nothing
in
this
volume
or
anything
else
supporting
the
government's
construction
because
it
was
not
the
construction
of
the
state
department
and
never
has
been.
and
as
the
present
acting
bureau
later
bureau
director
of
the
bureau
of
security
and
consular
affairs
pointed
out
from
his
point
of
view,
we've
cited
it,
it's
in
our
brief,
passport
validity
and
restrictions
all
relate
to
this
subject
of
foreign
affairs
under
the
211
(a)
problem
not
under
the
departing
and
entering
concept.
now,
we
come
to
the
administrative
implementation
of
a
statute
and
as
to
that
as
we
show
your
honors
never
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
or
its
predecessor
statutes
of
1918
and
1941
was
there
ever
a
proclamation,
an
executive
order,
a
state
departmental
regulation
referring
to
area
restrictions
authorizing
area
restrictions
that
of
course
we
know
taking
the
other
side
of
the
coin
never
when
area
restrictions
were
imposed
by
the
secretary
of
state
where
they
impose
except
under
the
heading
of
an
alleged
injuring
power
or
a
passport
act
where
there
was
a
--
an
act
of
1926
or
a
prior
act.
these
are
the
two
lines
which
have
to
be
kept
into
consideration
in
analyzing
what
we're
talking
about.
now,
i
pass
over
the
various
statements
that
have
been
made
by
the
department.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
even
in
zemel
in
the
district
court
as
the
record
at
--
record
63
will
show
your
honors,
the
government's
position,
the
department
of
justice's
position
was
that
the
area
restrictions
were
under
211
(a)
and
not
under
1185,
the
statute
involved
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
need
for
a
legislation
let
me
say
a
word,
of
course
a
proposal
that
has
been
made
by
a
governmental
department
doesn't
prove,
it
doesn't
have
the
power.
but
what
shall
say
here
when
there
has
been
this
avalanche
of
proposals
made
by
the
department
of
state
and
by
congressmen,
sympathetic
with
it
or
not
sympathetic
with
it
to
give
the
department
of
state
this
particular
kind
of
power.
i
don't
understand
the
explanation
as
been
given
that
perhaps
somebody
thought
the
department
had
the
power
or
perhaps
they
disagreed
with
the
extent
of
the
power
that
the
department
wanted
because
the
bills
were
sufficiently
varied
to
take
into
consideration
every
possible
contingency.
the
fact
is
and
this
is
one
of
the
interesting
facts
of
life
that
despite
the
foreboding
of
the
department
of
justice
in
kent
against
dulles,
the
department
never,
the
--
was
able
to
get
the
authority
to
turn
kent
against
dulles
back
although
clearly
the
department
doesn't
have
the
power
to
deny
passports,
the
people
on
political
grounds.
and
so
here,
the
department
has
not
been
able
to
persuade
congress
to
give
it
this
power
now
sought
for
nine
years.
we
think
that
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case
is
applicable.
this
practical
construction
of
the
act
by
those
entrusted
with
its
administration
is
reinforced
by
the
administration.
i'm
paraphrasing
one
word,
unsuccessful
attempt
to
secure
from
congress
an
expressed
grant
of
authority.
and
that
explains
not
inadequacy
in
writing
a
brief,
that
explains
why
we
have
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
mr.
chief
justice
because
this
is
all
there
is.
the
government
is
unable
candidly
to
find
anything
in
this
statute
which
would
justify
its
application
and
i
think
even
in
the
civil
statute
talking
about
1185.
now,
this
construction
the
government
seeks
is
of
course
also,
one,
which
would
pose
directly
the
questions
put
by
mr.
justice
black
namely,
"is
the
statute
a
clear
statute
and
where
are
the
legislative
standards?"
i
take
from
my
authority
if
your
honors
who
have
seen
throughout
this
argument
the
department
of
state
and
i
think
that
what
mr.
philip
heymann,
the
present
acting
director
of
the
bureau
of
security
and
consular
affairs
and
a
well-known
scholar
said
very
candidly
that
the
department
isn't
interested
in
problems
of
litigation
but
in
getting
things
done
and
in
stating
the
problems
fairly
to
the
congress.
what
mr.
heymann
said
in
the
hearings
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
is
we
agree
with
the
need
to
provide
clear
statutory
authority
for
the
imposition
of
necessary
area
restrictions
and
appropriate
enforcement
provisions.
and
he
said,
in
the
present
view
held
either
before
or
after
that.
in
other
words,
right
now
we
have
broadly
worded
authority
to
do
whatever
we
want
and
very
sloppy
statutory
authority
to
enforce
what
we
do.
well,
i
think
it
has
been
demonstrated
by
all
of
counsel
here
that
the
authority
is
so
broadly
worded
as
to
be
meaningless
if
we
are
to
interpret
1185
as
the
government
suggest
and
mr.
heymann
never
suggested
1185
to
be
used
here
and
obviously
to
say
that
there
are
sloppy
statutory
authorities
to
enforce
what
we
want
here
is
equally
appropriate.
and
mr.
heymann
then
addressed
himself
to
the
second
problem
that
was
discussed
here
by
mr.
mcternan,
the
questions
of
standards
because
we
are
dealing
here,
if
the
court
pleases
with
an
act
as
i
think
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
by
an
undersecretary
of
state
for
administration
and
i
may
say
the
new
regulations
that
came
down
a
short
while
ago
that
we
referred
yesterday
by
a
deputy,
undersecretary
of
state
for
administration.
so
we're
moving
down
the
ladder
now
as
we
regulate
the
conduct
of
citizens
suppose
to
affect
their
criminal
status.
mr.
heymann
said
on
the
subject,
as
you
know
the
secretary's
authority
to
restrict
travel
has
until
now
been
exercised
without
any
legislative
enacted
standards
and
required
procedures.
one
of
the
important
purposes
of
the
proposed
state
department
bill
is
to
provide
congressional
standards
for
the
restriction
of
travel.
well,
i
suggest
that
until
we
have
carried
out
mr.
heymann's
proposal
and
have
a
statute
that
is
precise
and
had
one
that
has
standards
and
until
we
have
had
a
statute
that
is
clear
and
there
has
some
legislative
history
behind
it
to
support
the
government
rather
than
this
multiplicity
of
evidence
against
it
that
the
prosecutions
could
wait.
thank
you
your
honor.
