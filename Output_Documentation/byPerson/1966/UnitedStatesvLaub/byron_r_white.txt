well,
if
the
--
don't
you
think
there
was
something
that
didn't
deliberate
on
the
government's
part
on
trying
it
on
this
theory.
i
suppose
you
had
the
opportunity
if
you
could've
proved
it,
to
prove
that
she
had
no
passport
at
all.
justice

and
there
would
be
absolutely
--
and
you
say,
at

the
government
claims
there
would
be
no
problem
at
all
then
to
convict
her
under
the
statute.
justice
byron

white
now,
if
you
knew
and
you
should
say
that
she
had
an
unrevoked
passport
and
you
didn't
prove
it,
why
should
you
get
another
chance
to
prove
it?
justice
byron

white
well,
was
there
any
mystery
at
all
about
whether
or
not
she
had
a
passport?

good
heavens.
i
don't
know
why
but
--
oh,
yes,
you
make
it
--
i'm
all
the
way
up
here
on
this
case
when
you
should
--
you
say
want
to
go
back
and
retry
her
on
the
theory
you
should've
had
in
the
--
at
the
very
first
instance,
very
simple
level.
