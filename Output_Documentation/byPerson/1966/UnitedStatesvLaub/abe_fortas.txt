you
mr.

i
take
it
that
your
argument
is
that
some
importance
should
be
attached
to
18
u.s.c.
1544
despite
the
facts
that
that
is
not
a
statute
under
which
this
was
brought,

is
that
right?

despite
the
fact
that
18

1544
is
confined
to
prohibition
of
the
use
of
the
passport
in
the
country
that

we
have
nothing

what

whatever
it

did,

justice

so
that
1544
is
somewhat
remote
from
the
particular
issue;
i
take
it
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
1544
is
useful
to
your
cause
because
of
the
very
fact
that
it
indicates
that
with
respect
to
predecessor
action,
the
state
department
gave
warning
of
some
kind
of
criminal
penalty
was
attached
to
some
kind
of
activity
relating
to
passports
which
didn't
cover
travel
to
particular
countries.

that
about
all
it

one
of

justice

the
