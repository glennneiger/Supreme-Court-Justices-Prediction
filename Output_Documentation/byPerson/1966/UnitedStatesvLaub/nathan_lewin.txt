mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
so
far
as
the
stipulation
is
concern
mr.
chief
justice
or
the
reference
in
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
in
the
--
both?
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
let
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
it
wouldn't.
well,
the
stipulation
would,
i'd
been
hoping
to
address
myself
to
it
and
i
just
didn't
have
the
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
so
far
as
the
stipulation
is
concern,
i
think
we
plainly
concede
that
the
statement
in
the
stipulation
that
mr.
travis
did
not
"bear"
a
valid
united
states
passport
specifically
endorsed
to
travel
to
cuba
could
not
or
just
standing
there
alone
sustain
a
conviction
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
only
way
that
you
could
violate
section
1185
would
be
if
you
had
no
passport
at
all
when
you
left
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
if
section
--
if
this
court
would
conclude
that
section
1185
applied
only
to
departures
with
either
a
revoked
or
expired
or
no
passport
whatever.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
the
statement
in
this
stipulation
prevents
her
conviction
on
that
theory
so
that
if
we
are
wrong
on
our
major
argument
here
this
court
would
hold
that
we're
wrong
then
we
don't
urge
that
her
conviction
could
be
affirmed.
we
do
however
urge
that
if
the
court
were
so
to
hold
we
should
be
free
to
retry
the
petitioner
on
that
ground
and
we
think
that
that's
plainly
within
bryan
versus
united
states.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
other
words,
we
think
what
that
would
be
is
that
would
be
a
failure,
a
really
quite
and
accidental,
i
think
failure
of
proof
because
of
the
construction
of
the
--
because
of
the
ambiguity
of
a
stipulation
as
to
a
particular
element
of
the
offense
which
the
government
did
not
believe
it
had
to
establish
at
the
time
this
trial
was
conducted.
now,
we
think
that's
what
bryan
versus
united
states
in
338
u.s.
held
when
it
construed
28
u.s.c.
2106
to
authorize
a
remand
for
a
retrial
and
that's
in
effect
what
this
court
did
as
to
a
substantial
number
of
the
petitioners
in
the
yates
case
in
354
u.s.
so
that
so
far
as
the
stipulation
is
concern
as
i
say,
we
would
--
we
concede
that
her
conviction
could
not
just
simply
be
affirmed
if
our
major
position
is
rejected.
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
think
that
we
should
be
permitted
to
a
retrial
on
this
indictment
which
simply
charges
a
violation
of
1185
pretty
much
in
its
terms
and
to
prove
at
such
a
retrial
that
she
in
fact
had
only
a
revoked
passport
and
therefore
if
she
did
have
only
a
revoked
passport
we
submit
she's
no
better
off
for
having
travelled
to
cuba
then
if
she
had
gone
with
the
revoked
passport
to
paris
or
to
london
or
any
place
else.
the
statute
on
its
face
plainly
we
think,
prohibits
that
if
it
prohibits
any.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
we
think
that
exactly
what
this
court
did
as
i
say
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
yes.
well,
we
think
--
we
--
definitely
and
that's
why
we
concede
mr.
chief
justice
that
she
couldn't
be
convicted
on
this
stipulation
if
our
principle
line
of
argument
is
rejected.
and
we
say
that
if
it
is
then
the
most
we're
entitled
to
do
is
to
go
back
and
retry
her
and
introduce
that
element
of
the
offense
which
we
did
not
as
of
the
time
the
first
trial
believe
we
had
to
prove.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'm
sure
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
we
think
that's
really
what
bryan
and
what
yates
say
that
if
the
government
is
--
has
proceeded
under
the
wrong
theory
of
law
the
first
time
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
simply
trying
a
second
trial
in
order
to
introduce
evidence
that
or
in
order
to
present
it
to
another
jury
if
you
like.
then
fairness
and
justice
which
is
what
28
u.s.,
the
words
in
it,
the
standard
incorporate
in
section
2106
really
entitles
the
government's
fell
back
for
a
retrial.
i
must
say
candidly
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
that
this
was
intentionally
so
designed.
i
think
probably
both
parties
at
the
time
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
drafted
the
stipulation,
mr.
mcternan
believed
that
the
issue
was
where
the
travel
to
cuba
was
a
violation
of
section
1185.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
mystery
there.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that's
true
but
the
way
the
case
was
tried
and
the
way
the
stipulation
was
worded,
it
just
doesn't
present
that
very
simple
case.
as
for
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
really
believe
that
this
case
was
designed
with
the
view
in
mind
that
we
would
bring
it
to
this
court.
i
mean,
we
certainly
are
not
the
moving
party
in
this
court,
it
was
a
conviction
in
the
district
court
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
because
of
it
--
but
because
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
of
the
difficulties
of
proof
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
got
to
prove
in
this
kind
of
a
statute
even
under
our
construction
of
it
that
that
the
traveler
had
the
intent
at
the
time
he
departed
the
united
states.
and
it's
a
very
difficult
burden
that
was
established
in
this
case
and
in
laub,
the
government
had
such
proof.
if
i
--
and
then
if
i
may
just
respond
mr.
chief
justice
in
mr.
mcternan's
comment
that
18
u.s.c.
1544
is
noble
and
was
not
cited
in
response
to
the
senate
committee's
question.
the
answer
at
least
so
far
as
it
appears
in
the
hearings
on
page
59
specifically
does
cite
18
u.s.c.
44.
the
department
of
state
responded
that
there
are
laws
in
which
might
well
be
violating
the
course
of
such
travel,
e.g.
trading
that
the
enemy
act
and
treasury
regulations
there
under,
18
u.s.c.
1544,
etcetera.
so,
it
was
specifically
cited
at
that
time
and
it
appeared
in
the
passports.
so,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
this
other
statute
is
not
a
noble
creation
of
the
department
of
state
just
raised
for
purpose
of
this
case.
turning
to
the
laub
case,
that
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
pursuant
to
the
criminal
appeals
act
from
a
dismissal
of
a
one
count
indictment
charging
nine
appellees
with
conspiring
to
violate
section
1185
by
inducing
and
recruiting
a
group
of
individuals
to
depart
the
united
states
for
cuba
without
bearing
passports
valid
for
travel
to
that
destination.
in
this
case,
unlike
travis
the
status
of
the
traveler's
passport
is
clear.
it
was
made
so
by
the
government's
bill
of
particulars
which
alleged
that
all
the
persons
referred
to
in
the
indictment,
in
other
words
those
who
were
traveling
posses
during
the
relevant
period
unexpired
and
unrevoked
united
states
passports
which
however
had
not
been
specifically
validated
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
travel
to
cuba.
so,
this
case
does
not
involve
the
ambiguity
presented
in
travis.
two
of
the
appellees
here,
laub
and
luce
(ph)
were
also
named
in
a
companion
indictment
which
charged
them
and
two
others
with
having
arranged
an
earlier
similar
trip
to
cuba
one
year
prior
to
the
trip
involved
in
this
indictment
in
june
1963
and
with
having
made
trips
to
cuba
in
violation
of
section
215
(b).
the
defendants
in
that
case
except
luce
were
tried
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
in
a
non-jury
trial
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the
district
judge
found
them
all
not
guilty.
his
opinion
in
that
case
which
contains
extensive
factual
findings
and
an
elaborate
discussion
of
a
law
was
incorporated
by
reference
since
the
judgment
of
dismissal
in
this
case
because
the
grounds
of
this
--
for
dismissing
the
indictment
here
were
identical
to
his
grounds
for
entering
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
in
that
case.
the
judgments
in
both
cases
rested
on
the
district
judge's
conclusion
that
section
1185
(b)
did
not
cover
departures
for
destinations
on
which
travel
restrictions
have
been
imposed.
the
judge
in
the
present
case
in
other
words
agree
with
the
principle
contention
made
by
the
petitioner
in
travis
that
section
215
(b)
is
only
a
"border
control
statute"
ends
the
question
of
statutory
construction
squarely
presented.
now,
i
find
and
i'd
like
to
continue
along
that
line
in
discussing
what
really
was
the
major
thrust
of
the
district
judge's
opinion,
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case
and
of
the
claimed
made
by
the
petitioners
which
is
--
and
this
relates
back
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
yesterday,
"what
the
administrative
practice
of
the
department
of
state
was?"
now,
the
district
judge
here
found
and
petitioners
have
argued
in
travis
and
the
appellees
have
found
--
have
argued
here
that
it
was
a
department
of
state's
continuous
position
up
until
travel
restriction
were
posed
in
cuba
that
the
restrictions
put
in
to
the
passport
as
to
the
invalidity
of
the
passport
to
travel
to
certain
destinations
were
civil
only
and
contemplated
no
criminal
sanctions.
now,
as
i
try
to
explain
in
the
earlier
argument
--
in
the
travis
case,
the
real
difficulty
here
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
there
are
two
criminal
statutes
which
might
apply
to
travel
to
restricted
areas.
one
is
the
one
which
prohibits
use
of
a
passport
in
violation
of
its
terms
and
conditions
and
which
would
be
violated
therefore
if
the
traveler
in
the
foreign
country
used
the
passport
to
enter
the
country,
showed
it
or
in
some
other
way
exhibited
it.
that's
18
u.s.c.
1544
and
we
submit
that
it's
quite
clear
from
the
administrative
practice
that
the
department
of
state
had
always
viewed
that
statute
which
applies
both
in
peace
time
and
in
war
time
as
applicable
when
there
is
proof
of
use.
now,
petitioner
or
the
--
and
the
--
petitioner
in
travis
and
the
appellees
here
and
the
district
judge
below
relied
on
certain
statements
made
by
the
department
of
state
in
1919
and
1952
and
in
1957.
i
think
those
really
do
not
support
the
conclusion
that
the
department
of
state
was
in
effect
disavowing
criminal
sanctions
for
violations
of
area
restrictions
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
but
i
would
also
like
to
call
attention
what
is
quite
clear
and
what
is
not
been
cited
out
below
and
it
was
--
it's
not
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief
either
but
it's
quite
--
what
is
quite
clear
is
a
press
release
for
example
issued
or
press
release
issued
at
the
outbreak
of
world
war
ii
in
september
1939
where
the
department
of
state
announced
that
passports
which
are
therefore
been
issued
would
not
be
valid
for
use
and
travel
from
united
states
to
any
country
in
europe
unless
it
is
submitted
to
the
department
of
state
for
validation.
now,
that
announcement
which
appears
at
page
534
of
hackworth
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
volumes
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
briefs
in
travis
and
laub
and
by
the
district
judge
also
says
the
same
thing
as
the
passports
themselves
said
which
is,
should
a
person
to
whom
a
passport
has
been
issued
use
it
in
violation
of
the
conditions
or
restrictions
contained
therein
the
protection
of
the
united
states
may
likewise
be
withheld
from
him
while
he's
abroad
and
he
will
be
liable
for
prosecution
under
the
provisions
of
section
221
of
title
22
of
the
u.s.
code
which
reads
in
part
and
then
it
quotes
that
statute.
in
other
words,
the
very
press
release
that
announced
that
there
--
restrictions
would
be
imposed
prior
to
world
war
ii
specifically
referred
to
what
is
now
18
u.s.c.
1544.
now,
it's
true
that
the
department
of
state
did
not
at
that
time
refer
to
this
statute.
the
very
simple
reason
is
that
this
statute
was
not
on
the
books.
its
predecessor
was
not
on
the
books
either.
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1914
to
apply
only
in
time
of
war.
it
was
reenacted
in
1941
to
apply
in
time
of
war
and
during
the
national
emergency
which
have
been
declared
by
president
roosevelt
in
may
of
1941.
it
was
reenacted
in
1952
to
apply
in
time
of
war
and
during
any
national
emergency.
well,
the
time
that
restrictions
were
imposed
prior
to
world
war
ii,
section
1185
or
its
predecessor
which
just
not
a
viable
statute.
now,
the
district
court
below
or
the
petitioner
in
travis
and
the
appellees
here
point
to
really
three
statements,
public
release
as
issued
by
the
department
of
state.
one
was
the
release
issued
in
1919
when
hostilities
were
over
and
which
did
not
refer
to
any
criminal
sanction.
well,
that's
true.
i
mean
it
certainly
didn't
refer
to
the
predecessor
of
section
1185
because
1185
apply
only
in
time
of
war
and
it
was
very
questionable
whether
it
could've
applied
then.
they
also
rely
on
the
press
release
issued
in
1952
when
restrictions
were
imposed
on
travel
to
iron
curtain
countries.
but
1952
was
two
years
after
president
truman
had
announced
the
--
a
nation
--
a
new
national
emergency
in
1950.
the
act
passed
in
1941
was
no
longer
applicable
at
the
time
the
new
area
restrictions
were
imposed.
the
act
passed
in
1941
applied
when
the
united
states
is
at
war
or
during
the
national
emergency
announced
in
may
of
1941.
by
1952,
the
united
states
was
not
technically
at
war
and
the
national
emergency
announced
in
1941
had
been
superseded
by
the
national
emergency
announced
in
1950.
so,
obviously
the
restrictions
imposed
in
1952
could
not
have
made
any
reference
to
the
statute
enacted
in
1941
because
it
too
was
not
a
viable
statute
at
that
time.
a
month
later
after
the
imposition
to
travel
restrictions
then,
the
statute
involved
here
was
enacted
in
that
provided
that
it
was
to
apply
that
in
times
of
war
and
in
times
of
national
emergency
and
of
course
that
statute
was
applicable
thereafter.
it
was
not
specifically
cited
in
the
--
or
specifically
listed
in
the
passports,
the
other
statute
was
18
u.s.c.
1544.
but
the
fact
that
the
department
of
state
did
not
refer
to
this
statute
or
its
predecessors
in
the
1919
release,
on
the
1952
release
we
think
doesn't
establish
anything
because
neither
or
it
certainly
quite
arguable
that
neither
of
those
statutes
was
applicable
at
that
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
more
than
that.
i
think
what
it
does
is
it
rebuts
the
claim
that
the
department
of
state
has
always
which
is
very
basic
to
what
the
district
judge
here
found
and
what
the
thing
argued
in
this
case
in
the
prior
case
that
the
department
of
state
had
always
viewed
these
restrictions
as
being
civil
only
and
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
area
of
restrictions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
that
definitely
a
difference
there
but
it
--
we
think
that
what
it
does
show
is
that
the
legend
on
the
passport
that
says
not
valid
for
travel
to
particular
countries.
it
was
always
supposed
by
the
department
of
state
to
be
enforceable
by
criminal
sanction
and
that
if
the
passport
indeed
had
not
cited
any
statute
at
all
but
had
merely
said
these
restrictions
are
enforceable
by
criminal
sanctions.
in
other
words,
it
left
it
quite
ambiguous
as
to
what
the
criminal
sanctions
were
or
what
could
permissibly
be
done
then
i
think
they
--
would
certainly
be
no
basis
for
the
argument
that
petitioners
are
making
or
the
--
petitioner
makes
in
travis
to
the
appellees
here
that
they
weren't
put
on
notice
that
there
was
any
criminal
sanction
attached
to
area
restrictions.
we're
saying
in
other
words,
that
congress
really
armed
the
department
of
state
or
the
executive
in
the
enforcement
of
these
kinds
of
restrictions
with
two
strings
to
the
bow
that
because
most
instances
of
area
restrictions,
first
of
all,
area
restrictions
in
peace
time
and
area
restrictions
as
to
countries
with
whom
we
did
have
diplomatic
relations
and
a
substantial
number
of
area
restriction
that
go
--
did
involve
countries
with
whom
we
had
diplomatic
relations
and
where
a
passport
would
be
used.
so
because
the
substantial
number
of
violations
of
those
would
probably
be
covered
by
18
u.s.c.
1544
the
department
of
state
focused
its
attention
on
that
statute
but
there
was
really
another
string
which
congress
have
provided
and
we
just
don't
think
that
the
executive
should
be
prohibited
from
using
the
second
string
simply
because
it's
been
given
an
addition
to
the
first
and
its
mainly
when
it
provided
warnings
in
the
passports
which
referred
to
the
first.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
it
certainly
demonstrates
two
things
i
think
mr.
chief
justice.
it
demonstrates
that
a
proposition
which
we
have
never
contested
which
is
that
the
present
law
has
substantial
loopholes.
an
individual
who
leaves
the
united
states
without
the
intent
to
go
to
cuba
and
let's
say
who
then
goes
to
cuba
having
informed
that
intent
somewhere
else
is
--
violates
no
statute
because
he
doesn't
use
his
passport,
he
doesn't
depart
with
the
intent
of
going
to
cuba
and
therefore
he's
violated
no
statute.
and
i
think
a
mandatory
legislation
is
necessary
for
that
reason.
but
i
think
it
also
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
he
pointed
that
out
specifically
but
i
think
that
the
testimony
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
testimony
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
to
testimony
yes,
before
the
hearings
at
that
time
and
to
hearings
continuing
to
this
very
day
on
similar
kinds
of
legislations
is
repeatedly
pointed
out
these
loopholes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
have
not
cited
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
--
i
gather
--
at
the
time
we
wrote
the
brief
i
suppose
we
just
--
either
just
overlooked
it
or
didn't
put
it
in
but
we
could
provide
the
--
provide
that
additional
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
--
we're
mr.--
really
mr.
chief
justice
what
it
goes
to
is
it
--
it's
a
sort
of
a
surrebuttal,
it's
an
answer
to
the
claim
that
the
executive
must
have
thought
that
this
legislation
didn't
cover
it
because
he
proposed
other
statutes
and
we
submit
that
we
--
well,
for
one
thing
we
agree
that
there
were
loopholes
and
that
other
statutes
are
necessary
and
i
was
going
to
say
a
second
thing
in
answer
to
your
question
which
was
that
we
don't
doubt
and
i
don't
want
to
be
mistaken
today.
i'm
thinking
--
we
admit
that
the
statute
is
not
as
clear
as
the
department
of
state
would
like
to
see
it
or
as
the
department
of
justice
would
like
to
see
it.
we
think
that
it's
important
and
i
think
the
testimony
before
these
committees
has
also
focused
on
that.
it's
important
to
have
statute
which
would
say
in
just
precisely
so
many
words
that
any
citizen
who
enters
an
area
to
which
travel
has
been
restricted
commits
a
crime.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
would
help,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
yes,
we
think
he
was,
definitely.
and
we
think
the
state
department
feels
it
would
help
to
have
him
a
clear
statute
then
the
statute
which
is
now
on
the
books.
i
think
the
only
difference
really
is
that
we
think
the
statute
now
on
the
books
does
and
that's
our
position
in
this
case
does
cover
the
states
as
well.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i've
never
seen
any
official
recognition
of
it
but
i'm
sure
it's
--
it
is
a
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
pretty
don't
know
a
pretty
well-known
report
and
--
i'm
sure
that
those
who
were
involved
with
the
problem
have
perhaps
seen
it
and
have
read
it.
and
it
--
indeed
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
also
bears
on
the
reasons
why
the
mandatory
legislation
may
very
well
consort
that
if
a
committee
such
as
that
thought
that
the
department
of
state
in
effect
conceded
that
there
were
no
criminal
sanctions
the
department
of
state
then
felt
it
was
obligatory
to
seek
a
legislation
and
we
could
make
that
clear.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
go
to
one
final
point
which
is
a
point
that
the
district
judge
here
rely
on
and
he
said,
"well,
why
congress
really
intended
to
make
it
a
crime
to
violate
area
restrictions,
why
was
that
not
specifically
spelled
out
in
the
statute."
and
i
think
that
there
are
really
two
possible
--
we
really
have
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
specifically
spelling
out
in
this
statute
that
area
restrictions
will
cover
and
that
would
be
a
violation
of
this
statute
to
travel
in
violation
of
an
area
restriction
would
by
the
rule
of
construction
of
exclusio
unius
exclusio
alterius
possibly
lead
to
a
court's
ruling
that
any
other
restriction
on
the
validity
of
a
passport
might
not
apply.
and
as
i've
tried
to
demonstrate
the
secretary
of
state
finds
it
necessary
to
impose
other
restrictions
on
validity
such
as
the
restriction
in
the
official
passport
to
its
being
restricted
to
official
use
only
or
even
the
restriction
that
a
passport
is
not
valid
until
it
is
signed,
that
its
not
valid
if
it's
mutilated.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
it
has.
but
the
--
but
i
think
that
that's
just
one
possibility.
i
think
congress
may
have
thought
--
it
wanted
to
give
broad
powers
without
presenting
these
problems.
i
think
another
problem
really
was
that
as
of
that
time
it
may
very
well
have
been
dubious
as
to
whether
congress
could
constitutionally
enact
the
statute
that
would
make
criminal
a
conduct
which
is
engaged
in
totally
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it
wasn't
until
1922
when
united
states
versus
bowman
in
260
u.s.
that
this
court
first
--
not
even
in
a
square
holding
met
that
contention
had
said
that
it
would
be
permissible
and
it
wasn't
until
1932
in
the
contempt
case
of
blockburger
versus
united
states
in
284
u.s.
that
that
was
squarely
decided
by
this
court.
so,
i
think
there
have
may
very
well
have
been
substantial
doubts
even
back
in
the
1918
as
to
whether
a
statute
could
be
enacted
that
said,
if
you
travel
the
country
"x"
in
violation
of
the
secretary
of
states
--
in
violation
to
secretary
of
state's
restrictions
in
his
passport,
in
your
passport,
you've
committed
a
crime
because
then
just
the
mere
act
a
crossing
that
boundary
would've
been
the
crime.
we
think
that
the
congress
in
1918
which
had
the
problem
before
it
for
the
first
time
and
which
later
congress
has
adopted
really
knew
of
the
department
of
state's
policy
of
restrictive
endorsements
as
of
war
time
and
when
they
enacted
a
war
time
statute
but
they
intended
at
that
time
to
say
was
that
such
restrictions
of
the
secretary
explicitly
imposes
in
his
passport
are
restrictions
which
if
a
traveler
departs
in
violation
of
them
with
the
intent
to
violate
them,
he
is
violating
the
criminal
law.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
so
far
as
the
stipulation
is
concern
mr.
chief
justice
or
the
reference
in
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
in
the
--
both?
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
let
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
it
wouldn't.
well,
the
stipulation
would,
i'd
been
hoping
to
address
myself
to
it
and
i
just
didn't
have
the
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
so
far
as
the
stipulation
is
concern,
i
think
we
plainly
concede
that
the
statement
in
the
stipulation
that
mr.
travis
did
not
"bear"
a
valid
united
states
passport
specifically
endorsed
to
travel
to
cuba
could
not
or
just
standing
there
alone
sustain
a
conviction
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
only
way
that
you
could
violate
section
1185
would
be
if
you
had
no
passport
at
all
when
you
left
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
if
section
--
if
this
court
would
conclude
that
section
1185
applied
only
to
departures
with
either
a
revoked
or
expired
or
no
passport
whatever.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
the
statement
in
this
stipulation
prevents
her
conviction
on
that
theory
so
that
if
we
are
wrong
on
our
major
argument
here
this
court
would
hold
that
we're
wrong
then
we
don't
urge
that
her
conviction
could
be
affirmed.
we
do
however
urge
that
if
the
court
were
so
to
hold
we
should
be
free
to
retry
the
petitioner
on
that
ground
and
we
think
that
that's
plainly
within
bryan
versus
united
states.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
in
other
words,
we
think
what
that
would
be
is
that
would
be
a
failure,
a
really
quite
and
accidental,
i
think
failure
of
proof
because
of
the
construction
of
the
--
because
of
the
ambiguity
of
a
stipulation
as
to
a
particular
element
of
the
offense
which
the
government
did
not
believe
it
had
to
establish
at
the
time
this
trial
was
conducted.
now,
we
think
that's
what
bryan
versus
united
states
in
338
u.s.
held
when
it
construed
28
u.s.c.
2106
to
authorize
a
remand
for
a
retrial
and
that's
in
effect
what
this
court
did
as
to
a
substantial
number
of
the
petitioners
in
the
yates
case
in
354
u.s.
so
that
so
far
as
the
stipulation
is
concern
as
i
say,
we
would
--
we
concede
that
her
conviction
could
not
just
simply
be
affirmed
if
our
major
position
is
rejected.
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
think
that
we
should
be
permitted
to
a
retrial
on
this
indictment
which
simply
charges
a
violation
of
1185
pretty
much
in
its
terms
and
to
prove
at
such
a
retrial
that
she
in
fact
had
only
a
revoked
passport
and
therefore
if
she
did
have
only
a
revoked
passport
we
submit
she's
no
better
off
for
having
travelled
to
cuba
then
if
she
had
gone
with
the
revoked
passport
to
paris
or
to
london
or
any
place
else.
the
statute
on
its
face
plainly
we
think,
prohibits
that
if
it
prohibits
any.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
we
think
that
exactly
what
this
court
did
as
i
say
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
yes.
well,
we
think
--
we
--
definitely
and
that's
why
we
concede
mr.
chief
justice
that
she
couldn't
be
convicted
on
this
stipulation
if
our
principle
line
of
argument
is
rejected.
and
we
say
that
if
it
is
then
the
most
we're
entitled
to
do
is
to
go
back
and
retry
her
and
introduce
that
element
of
the
offense
which
we
did
not
as
of
the
time
the
first
trial
believe
we
had
to
prove.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'm
sure
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
we
think
that's
really
what
bryan
and
what
yates
say
that
if
the
government
is
--
has
proceeded
under
the
wrong
theory
of
law
the
first
time
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
simply
trying
a
second
trial
in
order
to
introduce
evidence
that
or
in
order
to
present
it
to
another
jury
if
you
like.
then
fairness
and
justice
which
is
what
28
u.s.,
the
words
in
it,
the
standard
incorporate
in
section
2106
really
entitles
the
government's
fell
back
for
a
retrial.
i
must
say
candidly
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
that
this
was
intentionally
so
designed.
i
think
probably
both
parties
at
the
time
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
drafted
the
stipulation,
mr.
mcternan
believed
that
the
issue
was
where
the
travel
to
cuba
was
a
violation
of
section
1185.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
mystery
there.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that's
true
but
the
way
the
case
was
tried
and
the
way
the
stipulation
was
worded,
it
just
doesn't
present
that
very
simple
case.
as
for
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
really
believe
that
this
case
was
designed
with
the
view
in
mind
that
we
would
bring
it
to
this
court.
i
mean,
we
certainly
are
not
the
moving
party
in
this
court,
it
was
a
conviction
in
the
district
court
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
because
of
it
--
but
because
of
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
of
the
difficulties
of
proof
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
got
to
prove
in
this
kind
of
a
statute
even
under
our
construction
of
it
that
that
the
traveler
had
the
intent
at
the
time
he
departed
the
united
states.
and
it's
a
very
difficult
burden
that
was
established
in
this
case
and
in
laub,
the
government
had
such
proof.
if
i
--
and
then
if
i
may
just
respond
mr.
chief
justice
in
mr.
mcternan's
comment
that
18
u.s.c.
1544
is
noble
and
was
not
cited
in
response
to
the
senate
committee's
question.
the
answer
at
least
so
far
as
it
appears
in
the
hearings
on
page
59
specifically
does
cite
18
u.s.c.
44.
the
department
of
state
responded
that
there
are
laws
in
which
might
well
be
violating
the
course
of
such
travel,
e.g.
trading
that
the
enemy
act
and
treasury
regulations
there
under,
18
u.s.c.
1544,
etcetera.
so,
it
was
specifically
cited
at
that
time
and
it
appeared
in
the
passports.
so,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
this
other
statute
is
not
a
noble
creation
of
the
department
of
state
just
raised
for
purpose
of
this
case.
turning
to
the
laub
case,
that
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
pursuant
to
the
criminal
appeals
act
from
a
dismissal
of
a
one
count
indictment
charging
nine
appellees
with
conspiring
to
violate
section
1185
by
inducing
and
recruiting
a
group
of
individuals
to
depart
the
united
states
for
cuba
without
bearing
passports
valid
for
travel
to
that
destination.
in
this
case,
unlike
travis
the
status
of
the
traveler's
passport
is
clear.
it
was
made
so
by
the
government's
bill
of
particulars
which
alleged
that
all
the
persons
referred
to
in
the
indictment,
in
other
words
those
who
were
traveling
posses
during
the
relevant
period
unexpired
and
unrevoked
united
states
passports
which
however
had
not
been
specifically
validated
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
travel
to
cuba.
so,
this
case
does
not
involve
the
ambiguity
presented
in
travis.
two
of
the
appellees
here,
laub
and
luce
(ph)
were
also
named
in
a
companion
indictment
which
charged
them
and
two
others
with
having
arranged
an
earlier
similar
trip
to
cuba
one
year
prior
to
the
trip
involved
in
this
indictment
in
june
1963
and
with
having
made
trips
to
cuba
in
violation
of
section
215
(b).
the
defendants
in
that
case
except
luce
were
tried
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
in
a
non-jury
trial
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the
district
judge
found
them
all
not
guilty.
his
opinion
in
that
case
which
contains
extensive
factual
findings
and
an
elaborate
discussion
of
a
law
was
incorporated
by
reference
since
the
judgment
of
dismissal
in
this
case
because
the
grounds
of
this
--
for
dismissing
the
indictment
here
were
identical
to
his
grounds
for
entering
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
in
that
case.
the
judgments
in
both
cases
rested
on
the
district
judge's
conclusion
that
section
1185
(b)
did
not
cover
departures
for
destinations
on
which
travel
restrictions
have
been
imposed.
the
judge
in
the
present
case
in
other
words
agree
with
the
principle
contention
made
by
the
petitioner
in
travis
that
section
215
(b)
is
only
a
"border
control
statute"
ends
the
question
of
statutory
construction
squarely
presented.
now,
i
find
and
i'd
like
to
continue
along
that
line
in
discussing
what
really
was
the
major
thrust
of
the
district
judge's
opinion,
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case
and
of
the
claimed
made
by
the
petitioners
which
is
--
and
this
relates
back
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
yesterday,
"what
the
administrative
practice
of
the
department
of
state
was?"
now,
the
district
judge
here
found
and
petitioners
have
argued
in
travis
and
the
appellees
have
found
--
have
argued
here
that
it
was
a
department
of
state's
continuous
position
up
until
travel
restriction
were
posed
in
cuba
that
the
restrictions
put
in
to
the
passport
as
to
the
invalidity
of
the
passport
to
travel
to
certain
destinations
were
civil
only
and
contemplated
no
criminal
sanctions.
now,
as
i
try
to
explain
in
the
earlier
argument
--
in
the
travis
case,
the
real
difficulty
here
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
there
are
two
criminal
statutes
which
might
apply
to
travel
to
restricted
areas.
one
is
the
one
which
prohibits
use
of
a
passport
in
violation
of
its
terms
and
conditions
and
which
would
be
violated
therefore
if
the
traveler
in
the
foreign
country
used
the
passport
to
enter
the
country,
showed
it
or
in
some
other
way
exhibited
it.
that's
18
u.s.c.
1544
and
we
submit
that
it's
quite
clear
from
the
administrative
practice
that
the
department
of
state
had
always
viewed
that
statute
which
applies
both
in
peace
time
and
in
war
time
as
applicable
when
there
is
proof
of
use.
now,
petitioner
or
the
--
and
the
--
petitioner
in
travis
and
the
appellees
here
and
the
district
judge
below
relied
on
certain
statements
made
by
the
department
of
state
in
1919
and
1952
and
in
1957.
i
think
those
really
do
not
support
the
conclusion
that
the
department
of
state
was
in
effect
disavowing
criminal
sanctions
for
violations
of
area
restrictions
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
but
i
would
also
like
to
call
attention
what
is
quite
clear
and
what
is
not
been
cited
out
below
and
it
was
--
it's
not
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief
either
but
it's
quite
--
what
is
quite
clear
is
a
press
release
for
example
issued
or
press
release
issued
at
the
outbreak
of
world
war
ii
in
september
1939
where
the
department
of
state
announced
that
passports
which
are
therefore
been
issued
would
not
be
valid
for
use
and
travel
from
united
states
to
any
country
in
europe
unless
it
is
submitted
to
the
department
of
state
for
validation.
now,
that
announcement
which
appears
at
page
534
of
hackworth
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
volumes
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
briefs
in
travis
and
laub
and
by
the
district
judge
also
says
the
same
thing
as
the
passports
themselves
said
which
is,
should
a
person
to
whom
a
passport
has
been
issued
use
it
in
violation
of
the
conditions
or
restrictions
contained
therein
the
protection
of
the
united
states
may
likewise
be
withheld
from
him
while
he's
abroad
and
he
will
be
liable
for
prosecution
under
the
provisions
of
section
221
of
title
22
of
the
u.s.
code
which
reads
in
part
and
then
it
quotes
that
statute.
in
other
words,
the
very
press
release
that
announced
that
there
--
restrictions
would
be
imposed
prior
to
world
war
ii
specifically
referred
to
what
is
now
18
u.s.c.
1544.
now,
it's
true
that
the
department
of
state
did
not
at
that
time
refer
to
this
statute.
the
very
simple
reason
is
that
this
statute
was
not
on
the
books.
its
predecessor
was
not
on
the
books
either.
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1914
to
apply
only
in
time
of
war.
it
was
reenacted
in
1941
to
apply
in
time
of
war
and
during
the
national
emergency
which
have
been
declared
by
president
roosevelt
in
may
of
1941.
it
was
reenacted
in
1952
to
apply
in
time
of
war
and
during
any
national
emergency.
well,
the
time
that
restrictions
were
imposed
prior
to
world
war
ii,
section
1185
or
its
predecessor
which
just
not
a
viable
statute.
now,
the
district
court
below
or
the
petitioner
in
travis
and
the
appellees
here
point
to
really
three
statements,
public
release
as
issued
by
the
department
of
state.
one
was
the
release
issued
in
1919
when
hostilities
were
over
and
which
did
not
refer
to
any
criminal
sanction.
well,
that's
true.
i
mean
it
certainly
didn't
refer
to
the
predecessor
of
section
1185
because
1185
apply
only
in
time
of
war
and
it
was
very
questionable
whether
it
could've
applied
then.
they
also
rely
on
the
press
release
issued
in
1952
when
restrictions
were
imposed
on
travel
to
iron
curtain
countries.
but
1952
was
two
years
after
president
truman
had
announced
the
--
a
nation
--
a
new
national
emergency
in
1950.
the
act
passed
in
1941
was
no
longer
applicable
at
the
time
the
new
area
restrictions
were
imposed.
the
act
passed
in
1941
applied
when
the
united
states
is
at
war
or
during
the
national
emergency
announced
in
may
of
1941.
by
1952,
the
united
states
was
not
technically
at
war
and
the
national
emergency
announced
in
1941
had
been
superseded
by
the
national
emergency
announced
in
1950.
so,
obviously
the
restrictions
imposed
in
1952
could
not
have
made
any
reference
to
the
statute
enacted
in
1941
because
it
too
was
not
a
viable
statute
at
that
time.
a
month
later
after
the
imposition
to
travel
restrictions
then,
the
statute
involved
here
was
enacted
in
that
provided
that
it
was
to
apply
that
in
times
of
war
and
in
times
of
national
emergency
and
of
course
that
statute
was
applicable
thereafter.
it
was
not
specifically
cited
in
the
--
or
specifically
listed
in
the
passports,
the
other
statute
was
18
u.s.c.
1544.
but
the
fact
that
the
department
of
state
did
not
refer
to
this
statute
or
its
predecessors
in
the
1919
release,
on
the
1952
release
we
think
doesn't
establish
anything
because
neither
or
it
certainly
quite
arguable
that
neither
of
those
statutes
was
applicable
at
that
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
more
than
that.
i
think
what
it
does
is
it
rebuts
the
claim
that
the
department
of
state
has
always
which
is
very
basic
to
what
the
district
judge
here
found
and
what
the
thing
argued
in
this
case
in
the
prior
case
that
the
department
of
state
had
always
viewed
these
restrictions
as
being
civil
only
and
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
area
of
restrictions.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
that
definitely
a
difference
there
but
it
--
we
think
that
what
it
does
show
is
that
the
legend
on
the
passport
that
says
not
valid
for
travel
to
particular
countries.
it
was
always
supposed
by
the
department
of
state
to
be
enforceable
by
criminal
sanction
and
that
if
the
passport
indeed
had
not
cited
any
statute
at
all
but
had
merely
said
these
restrictions
are
enforceable
by
criminal
sanctions.
in
other
words,
it
left
it
quite
ambiguous
as
to
what
the
criminal
sanctions
were
or
what
could
permissibly
be
done
then
i
think
they
--
would
certainly
be
no
basis
for
the
argument
that
petitioners
are
making
or
the
--
petitioner
makes
in
travis
to
the
appellees
here
that
they
weren't
put
on
notice
that
there
was
any
criminal
sanction
attached
to
area
restrictions.
we're
saying
in
other
words,
that
congress
really
armed
the
department
of
state
or
the
executive
in
the
enforcement
of
these
kinds
of
restrictions
with
two
strings
to
the
bow
that
because
most
instances
of
area
restrictions,
first
of
all,
area
restrictions
in
peace
time
and
area
restrictions
as
to
countries
with
whom
we
did
have
diplomatic
relations
and
a
substantial
number
of
area
restriction
that
go
--
did
involve
countries
with
whom
we
had
diplomatic
relations
and
where
a
passport
would
be
used.
so
because
the
substantial
number
of
violations
of
those
would
probably
be
covered
by
18
u.s.c.
1544
the
department
of
state
focused
its
attention
on
that
statute
but
there
was
really
another
string
which
congress
have
provided
and
we
just
don't
think
that
the
executive
should
be
prohibited
from
using
the
second
string
simply
because
it's
been
given
an
addition
to
the
first
and
its
mainly
when
it
provided
warnings
in
the
passports
which
referred
to
the
first.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
it
certainly
demonstrates
two
things
i
think
mr.
chief
justice.
it
demonstrates
that
a
proposition
which
we
have
never
contested
which
is
that
the
present
law
has
substantial
loopholes.
an
individual
who
leaves
the
united
states
without
the
intent
to
go
to
cuba
and
let's
say
who
then
goes
to
cuba
having
informed
that
intent
somewhere
else
is
--
violates
no
statute
because
he
doesn't
use
his
passport,
he
doesn't
depart
with
the
intent
of
going
to
cuba
and
therefore
he's
violated
no
statute.
and
i
think
a
mandatory
legislation
is
necessary
for
that
reason.
but
i
think
it
also
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
he
pointed
that
out
specifically
but
i
think
that
the
testimony
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
testimony
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
to
testimony
yes,
before
the
hearings
at
that
time
and
to
hearings
continuing
to
this
very
day
on
similar
kinds
of
legislations
is
repeatedly
pointed
out
these
loopholes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
have
not
cited
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
--
i
gather
--
at
the
time
we
wrote
the
brief
i
suppose
we
just
--
either
just
overlooked
it
or
didn't
put
it
in
but
we
could
provide
the
--
provide
that
additional
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
--
we're
mr.--
really
mr.
chief
justice
what
it
goes
to
is
it
--
it's
a
sort
of
a
surrebuttal,
it's
an
answer
to
the
claim
that
the
executive
must
have
thought
that
this
legislation
didn't
cover
it
because
he
proposed
other
statutes
and
we
submit
that
we
--
well,
for
one
thing
we
agree
that
there
were
loopholes
and
that
other
statutes
are
necessary
and
i
was
going
to
say
a
second
thing
in
answer
to
your
question
which
was
that
we
don't
doubt
and
i
don't
want
to
be
mistaken
today.
i'm
thinking
--
we
admit
that
the
statute
is
not
as
clear
as
the
department
of
state
would
like
to
see
it
or
as
the
department
of
justice
would
like
to
see
it.
we
think
that
it's
important
and
i
think
the
testimony
before
these
committees
has
also
focused
on
that.
it's
important
to
have
statute
which
would
say
in
just
precisely
so
many
words
that
any
citizen
who
enters
an
area
to
which
travel
has
been
restricted
commits
a
crime.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
would
help,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
agree
with
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
yes,
we
think
he
was,
definitely.
and
we
think
the
state
department
feels
it
would
help
to
have
him
a
clear
statute
then
the
statute
which
is
now
on
the
books.
i
think
the
only
difference
really
is
that
we
think
the
statute
now
on
the
books
does
and
that's
our
position
in
this
case
does
cover
the
states
as
well.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i've
never
seen
any
official
recognition
of
it
but
i'm
sure
it's
--
it
is
a
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
pretty
don't
know
a
pretty
well-known
report
and
--
i'm
sure
that
those
who
were
involved
with
the
problem
have
perhaps
seen
it
and
have
read
it.
and
it
--
indeed
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
also
bears
on
the
reasons
why
the
mandatory
legislation
may
very
well
consort
that
if
a
committee
such
as
that
thought
that
the
department
of
state
in
effect
conceded
that
there
were
no
criminal
sanctions
the
department
of
state
then
felt
it
was
obligatory
to
seek
a
legislation
and
we
could
make
that
clear.
now,
i
would
just
like
to
go
to
one
final
point
which
is
a
point
that
the
district
judge
here
rely
on
and
he
said,
"well,
why
congress
really
intended
to
make
it
a
crime
to
violate
area
restrictions,
why
was
that
not
specifically
spelled
out
in
the
statute."
and
i
think
that
there
are
really
two
possible
--
we
really
have
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
specifically
spelling
out
in
this
statute
that
area
restrictions
will
cover
and
that
would
be
a
violation
of
this
statute
to
travel
in
violation
of
an
area
restriction
would
by
the
rule
of
construction
of
exclusio
unius
exclusio
alterius
possibly
lead
to
a
court's
ruling
that
any
other
restriction
on
the
validity
of
a
passport
might
not
apply.
and
as
i've
tried
to
demonstrate
the
secretary
of
state
finds
it
necessary
to
impose
other
restrictions
on
validity
such
as
the
restriction
in
the
official
passport
to
its
being
restricted
to
official
use
only
or
even
the
restriction
that
a
passport
is
not
valid
until
it
is
signed,
that
its
not
valid
if
it's
mutilated.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
it
has.
but
the
--
but
i
think
that
that's
just
one
possibility.
i
think
congress
may
have
thought
--
it
wanted
to
give
broad
powers
without
presenting
these
problems.
i
think
another
problem
really
was
that
as
of
that
time
it
may
very
well
have
been
dubious
as
to
whether
congress
could
constitutionally
enact
the
statute
that
would
make
criminal
a
conduct
which
is
engaged
in
totally
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it
wasn't
until
1922
when
united
states
versus
bowman
in
260
u.s.
that
this
court
first
--
not
even
in
a
square
holding
met
that
contention
had
said
that
it
would
be
permissible
and
it
wasn't
until
1932
in
the
contempt
case
of
blockburger
versus
united
states
in
284
u.s.
that
that
was
squarely
decided
by
this
court.
so,
i
think
there
have
may
very
well
have
been
substantial
doubts
even
back
in
the
1918
as
to
whether
a
statute
could
be
enacted
that
said,
if
you
travel
the
country
"x"
in
violation
of
the
secretary
of
states
--
in
violation
to
secretary
of
state's
restrictions
in
his
passport,
in
your
passport,
you've
committed
a
crime
because
then
just
the
mere
act
a
crossing
that
boundary
would've
been
the
crime.
we
think
that
the
congress
in
1918
which
had
the
problem
before
it
for
the
first
time
and
which
later
congress
has
adopted
really
knew
of
the
department
of
state's
policy
of
restrictive
endorsements
as
of
war
time
and
when
they
enacted
a
war
time
statute
but
they
intended
at
that
time
to
say
was
that
such
restrictions
of
the
secretary
explicitly
imposes
in
his
passport
are
restrictions
which
if
a
traveler
departs
in
violation
of
them
with
the
intent
to
violate
them,
he
is
violating
the
criminal
law.
