mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
original
coordination
agreement
was
september
1961.
this
is
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
coordination
bill.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this
one
wants
the
(inaudible).
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
i
may
say
i
am
slightly
surprised
by
the
final
peroration
of
counsel
for
the
supply
system
here.
i
had
thought
up
to
the
time
of
about
ten
minutes
ago
that
the
supply
system
thought
that
if
it
were
to
get
a
license
that
it
could
do
a
job
in
the
public
interest
which
would
be
meet
the
test
of
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
and
by
hypothesis
would
be
as
good
as
anybody
else.
i
gather
now
they
had
some
doubts
about
that.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
preliminary
permit
issued
to
pacific
northwest
served
to
give
it
priority
for
an
application
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
as
the
commission
held.
if
it
did
--
pardon
me
--
if
it
did
not,
if
there
was
no
priority
which
followed
to
this
new
application,
then
we
would
agree
that
the
case
has
to
be
remanded
not
for
the
reason
mr.
ely
suggested
at
the
very
end
but
because
as
the
commission
held,
mr.
ely's
client,
the
supply
system,
is
a
municipality
and
has
certain
rights
of
second
chance
rights
under
the
statute.
there
are
very
serious
questions
in
this
record
as
the
commission
found
as
to
the
qualifications
of
the
supply
system.
the
commission
found
as
mr.
justice
douglas
had
mentioned
before
that
although
they
were
a
municipality
of
washington,
they
had
not
demonstrated
that
they
were
qualified
to
build
and
operate
a
dam
in
this
area.
the
commission
also
found
that
on
the
record
made
before
it,
they
had
not
shown
their
market
for
the
power
or
they
had
not
shown
their
financial
qualifications
to
build
it.
but
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
what
i'm
saying.
what
--
under
the
statutory
scheme
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
they
have
to
show
it
but
under
the
statutory
scheme,
as
a
preference
applicant,
assuming
they're
otherwise
legally
qualified,
they
would
have
a
second
chance
and
therefore
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right
because
they
would
have
this
second
chance.
they
said
there's
grave
doubts
about
it.
they
haven't
shown
it
now
but
that
is
not
grounds
for
denying
these
people
if
there
is
no
priority
here
then
these
people
have
a
second
chance.
and
this
is
true,
they
have
this
second
chance.
although
throughout
most
of
this
proceeding,
they
were
bitterly
opposing
the
application
for
a
dam
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
the
best
way
of
comprehensive
development.
now
the
commission's
reasons
for
believing
that
pacific
northwest
has
a
priority
for
the
high
mountain
sheep
project,
rest
are
our
views
of
the
statutory
structure
of
the
act
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
specifically,
we
think
that
in
order
to
make
any
sense
out
of
the
preliminary
permit
part
of
the
act,
you
must
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
three-year
permit
issued
to
pacific
northwest
in
1955,
though
it
in
terms
described
a
proposed
project
consisting
of
two
dams
at
mountain
sheep
and
pleasant
valley,
necessarily
provided
priority
for
any
application
filed
by
pacific
northwest
within
the
statutory
period
in
the
relevant
--
into
the
river.
and
this
what
the
language
of
section
4
or
5
of
the
act
is
talking
about.
it
is
a
person
who
owned
--
holds
a
preliminary
permit
as
a
statutory
priority
for
subsequent
license
applications
within
the
term
of
that
permit.
as
i
indicated
in
my
argument
in
the
previous
case,
we're
dealing
here
with
an
essential
licensing
standard
under
section
10
(a)
of
the
act,
which
impresses
a
specific
planning
function
on
the
commission
and
would
be
applicants.
operations
in
the
public
interest,
a
normal
licensing
or
certificate
standard
just
aren't
good
enough
best
adapted
to
a
comprehensive
plan
for
a
waterway
is
what
somebody
has
to
show.
and
while
congress
was
convinced
that
in
most
cases,
these
objectives
could
be
met
by
issuing
licenses
to
non-federal
entities,
be
they
private
groups
or
public
groups.
it
also
recognized
that
there
is
a
planning
that
has
to
be
(voice
overlap)
undertaken
and
that
a
reasonable
degree
of
priority
is
absolutely
essential
if
this
planning
is
going
to
be
undertaken.
it's
for
this
reason
that
we
have
this
otherwise
estranged
dual
structure
in
this
act.
we
don't'
really
have
a
licensing
scheme,
we
have
superimposed
on
this
licensing
scheme
the
separate
procedure
for
preliminary
permits
to
provide
priority
for
subsequent
license
applications.
and
it's
for
the
same
reason,
we
think,
that
the
suggestions
by
the
supply
system
that
the
scope
of
a
permit
must
be
limited
to
the
discreet
form
of
project
with
the
applicant
for
a
permit
tentatively
think
is
going
to
be
the
best
one
before
he
makes
his
investigations
would
work
against
the
statutory
scheme
not
in
favor.
one
minor
problem
with
that
is
that
if
the
permits
are
going
to
be
narrowly
limited
then
the
whole
idea
of
limiting
the
term
of
permits
is
--
can
be
avoided.
you
can
issue
successive
permits
tying
up
a
river
for
slightly
different
areas.but
more
important,
more
important,
if
you
require
the
person
seeking
a
permit
to
know
before
he
gets
his
permit,
the
exact
location
he's
going
to
build
in,
at
the
risk,
if
he
moves
from
there
or
if
he
builds
a
higher
dam
or
if
he
otherwise
changes
his
proposal,
he
loses
his
priority
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
believe
that
a
permit
covers
the
reach,
the
common
reach
of
the
stream.
this
case,
as
i
would
get
into
in
the
few
minutes,
it
covered
nez
perce,
it
covered
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
it
covered
the
mountain
sheep
site
and
it
covered
this
combination
thing,
it
covered
--
to
put
it
more
specifically,
the
area
which
was
in
dispute,
which
everybody
knew
was
in
dispute
from
all
time.
now
obviously
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
a
permit
--
obviously
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
obviously,
it
does
not
cover
the
salmon
river
at
all.it
is
true.
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
projects
within
this
reach
of
the
river,
specifically
the
nez
perce
project,
if
it
had
been
built,
would
have
been
mutually
inconsistent
with
some
of
the
dams
on
the
salmon.
but
we
do
not
suggest
and
nobody
has
suggested
that
a
permit
to
explore
the
snake
river
covers
with
it
a
priority
on
the
salmon
river.
now,
let
me
make
it
clear
that
i
am
not
talking
theory.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh!
yes,
we
do
make
provisions
for
amendments
of
the
permits
and
i'll
get
to
that
later
in
my
argument
to
where
that's
appropriate,
where
it
isn't
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
obviously
an
important
part
of
the
picture.
what
i
will
try
to
argue
is
that
amendments
are
not
intended
to
get
an
amendment
to
a
permit
every
time
you
change
your
plans
or
at
least
if
it
is
intended
for
this,
nobody
has
ever
known.
this
licensing
scheme
has
been
in
effect
for
47
years.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
with
example,
the
fact
is
that
change
and
significant
change,
sometimes
as
much
as
putting
in
completely
new
dams,
change
between
the
times
somebody
applies
for
a
permit
and
the
times
somebody
applies
for
a
license,
is
the
norm,
not
the
exception.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
sure
there
is,
but
you
have
to
ask
mr.
smith.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh,
no.
the
license
is
issued
for
50
years
but
the
dam
last
a
hundred
years.
at
least,
as
far
as
i
know,
with
very
exceptional
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
this
is
a
very
unusual
situation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
--
nobody
suggest
that
this
dam
will
not
to
be
there
at
the
end
of
a
license
period
50
years
from
now
and
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
the
normal
--
i
understand,
but
the
normal
depreciation
on
this
type
of
dam
which
is
worked
out
by
the
engineers
in
the
light
of
everything
you're
saying
is
approximately
75
to
a
100
years.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
you
have
to
add
--
there
are
--
you're
beyond
my
competence.
i
can
only
tell
you
that
everything
we
know
is
that
this
dam
like
all
other
major
projects
has
a
life
at
least
the
length
of
the
license
and
probably
closer
to
twice
the
length
of
the
license.
now,
i've
said
the
change
is
standard
between
the
time
you
apply
for
a
permit
and
the
time
you
get
--
you
apply
for
a
license.
but
that
really
understates
the
situation.
actually,
change
in
the
planning
mechanism
that's
involved
in
getting
a
license
from
the
federal
power
commission
doesn't
stop
with
the
license
application.
it
continues
throughout
the
licensing
process.
in
fact,
and
so
insistent
are
we
that
what
is
built
is
consistent
with
a
--
latest
developments
that
change
goes
on
after
the
licensing
proceeding.
the
only
type
of
situation
in
fact
in
which
it
can
be
expected
that
there
will
be
no
change
between
the
time
somebody
applies
for
preliminary
permit
and
the
time
he
gets
--
applies
for
a
license
is
in
the
circumstances
where
there's
no
need
for
any
further
investigation
because
the
plans
were
already
made.
and
in
this
type
of
situation,
the
commission
has
held
in
the
georgia
power
case
which
is
cited
on
page
82
of
our
brief
that
there's
no
basis
for
granting
a
permit
at
all.
now,
in
our
opinion,
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
this
necessary
plan
to
give
a
permit
to
explore
and
change
and
do
what
has
to
be
done
during
the
licensing
process
with
the
provisions,
the
equally
important
provisions
of
section
7
(a)
of
the
act,
which
give
preference
to
state
and
municipal
bodies.
now
on
the
contrary,
as
mr.
ely
quite
rightly
said,
the
one
area
in
which
they
do
not
have
permit
is
where
there
is
an
outstanding
preliminary
permit
covering
the
area.
preference
bodies
have
and
it's
very
important
to
have,
preference
for
getting
permits.
and
this
is
not
a
theoretical
right.
our
records
indicate
that
of
the
20
outstanding
permits
at
the
present
moment,
no
less
than
eight
of
them
are
held
by
preference
bodies,
including
a
number
of
preference
bodies
who
are
part
of
the
supply
system
itself.
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
during
the
course
of
the
history
in
which
there
have
been
actual
conflicts
between
a
private
group
and
a
preference
group,
seeking
a
preliminary
permit
and
where,
pursuant
to
the
preference
the
permit
for
the
exploration
giving
it
the
priority
has
gone
to
the
preference
body.
moreover,
it
is
incorrect
to
say
that
the
granting
of
a
permit
and
the
priority
it
carries
guarantees
a
license
to
the
party
who
has
got
the
priority,
this
is
well-illustrated,
probably
as
well-illustrated
as
any
given
case
by
the
facts
of
this
proceeding.
in
our
judgment,
as
we
made
clear
in
our
brief,
and
i'll
find
may
clear
in
this
argument,
pacific
northwest
had
a
priority
as
i
said
for
the
stretch
of
the
river
here
and
this
included
the
nez
perce
site
for
all
the
confluence
of
the
salmon
and
the
snake
river.
however,
it
did
not
file
an
application
for
any
project
based
at
nez
perce
within
the
three-year
period
of
its
permit.
who
did?
the
supply
system
did
and
we
had
a
comparative
case
between
the
supply
system
that
was
seeking
and
continued
to
seek
right
through
this
proceeding
a
license
for
nez
perce
and
pacific
northwest
which
had
applied
for
high
mountain
sheep.
now
despite
the
fact
that
the
priority
would've
covered
a
timely
filed
license
application
for
the
pacific
northwest
for
nez
perce,
since
they
didn't
file
one,
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
commission
had
agreed
with
the
basic
premise
of
the
supply
system
in
this
case,
that
a
dam
on
the
nez
perce
was
the
best
way
of
comprehensive
development,
that
the
power
matters
there,
outweighed
the
fish
matters
which
the
commission
doesn't
agree
with,
that
the
supply
system
would
have
won
this
case.
in
fact,
in
our
opinion,
they
would
have
won
the
case.
despite
the
priority,
despite
the
priority
for
the
nez
--
for
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
if
in
fact
pacific
northwest
had
filed
a
license
application
for
an
inadequate
development
based
on
high
mountain
sheep,
and
if
in
fact
the
belated
application
filed
by
the
supply
system
for
high
mountain
sheep
had
prescribed
a
superior
plan
of
operation,
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i'm
getting
to
that
right
now.
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
ely
does
suggest
that
exactly
that
happened.
in
fact,
very
strong
words
were
used
by
the
commission,
we're
alleged
to
have
expropriated
the
superior
plan
that
the
supply
system
had
for
high
mountain
sheep
and
give
it
to
unwillingly
i
guess
to
pacific
northwest.
now
the
facts
of
this
whole
discussion
are
very
simple.
both
parties
here,
in
the
beginning
of
their
--
at
least
from
the
time
they
applied
for
high
mountain
sheep
have
applied
for
major
comprehensive
dams
where
the
eventual
power
supply
of
2,000,000
kilowatts.
the
supply
system's
application
was
filed
two
years
after
pacific
northwest
almost
the
end
of
the
hearing,
called
for
generators
with
a
higher
capacity
than
the
generators
which
the
supply
--
in
which
pacific
northwest
had
originally
applied
for.
but
the
commission
held
that
this
was
not
a
significant
difference
between
the
two
parties.
expressly
held,
it's
not
a
significant
difference
between
the
two
parties
since
it
was
also
clear
on
this
record
that
pacific
northwest
had
stated
that
while
they
had
included
in
their
application
generators
of
the
type
which
were
then
be
available
at
the
time
they
made
their
application
that
they
are
in
fact
were
prepared
to
include
in
the
dam
when
they
got
it,
whatever
the
highest
rating,
the
feasible
generator
was
at
that
time.
so
that
the
commission,
contrary
to
what
mr.
ely
said,
expressly
finds
that
as
between
the
two
high
mountain
sheep
plants,
there
was
no
material
difference.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
problem
of
the
permit
and
the
situation
when
the
permit
was
issued.
i
would
agree
with
most
to
what
mr.
ely
said
about
facts
here
with
one
minor
exception.
everybody
knew
that
there
was
going
to
be
one
major
project
somewhere
in
the
area
here
and
there
were
three
or
four
potential
sites
for
it.
all
of
which
had
been
discussed.
there
was
the
nez
perce
site,
which
had
the
fish
problem,
turned
out
it
has
some
geological
problems
also.
there
was
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
which
had
a
lesser
fish
problem
but
still
a
fish
problem
and
there
were
the
sites
above
the
imnaha
and
again
i
have
to
use
the
term
mountain
sheep
because
that
--
it
happens
to
be
a
site
that
a
name
which
goes
both
above
and
below
the
imnaha.
i
wouldn't
agree
with
mr.
ely
when
he
said
it
was
clear
at
the
time
of
the
permit
that
any
site
above
the
imnaha
would
have
to
be
a
two
dam
site
with
the
major
dam
at
pleasant
valley.
there
was
dispute
as
to
this.
one
of
the
two
reports
included
in
the
chief
of
engineer's
report
had
said
a
high
dam
at
the
mountain
sheep
site
above
the
confluence
of
imnaha
was
feasible,
the
other
one
had
suggested
there
were
grave
doubts
as
to
the
geology
there
whether
it
would
support
a
high
dam.
it
was
an
issue
as
far
from
resolved
and
in
fact
one
of
the
major
things
that
was
done
by
pacific
northwest
during
the
permit
was
to
study
this
problem.
and
they
found
out
that
of
these
two
reports,
the
one
that
said
there
were
geological
faults
was
quite
right
and
that
a
high
dam
just
above
the
imnaha
was
not
feasible.
now,
the
permit
application
that
was
filed
by
pacific
northwest
here,
in
conformance
with
the
expressed
commission
rules,
specified
a
very
detailed
proposed
project.
the
reason
for
this,
the
reason
for
this
is
because
section
24
of
the
act
provides
an
automatic
land
withdrawal
of
all
lands
affected
by
any
application
for
a
preliminary
permit.
this
has
created
a
very
serious
problem
of
land
management
which
the
commission
over
the
years
in
cooperation
with
the
federal
agencies
involved
in
land
management
has
resolved
by
requiring
a
very
detailed
and
limited
application
for
preliminary
permit
to
avoid
unnecessary
land
withdrawals.
this
of
course
is
a
compromise
that
means
you
don't
have
land
withdrawals
beyond
the
best
estimate
--
guesstimate
of
where
the
most
likely
side
is
but
the
commission's
policy
which
the
secretary
as
i
understand
his
footnote
in
his
brief
strongly
supports
is
that
it
is
essential
that
these
land
withdrawals
be
kept
to
an
absolute
minimum.
the
traditional
commission
notice
of
application
during
the
47
years
of
operation
under
the
statute
has
similarly
been
limited
to
the
specific
terms
of
the
permit
application
and
up
to
this
time,
despite
the
fact
as
i
said,
change
between
the
application
permit
and
the
license
application
say
nothing
of
the
license
as
the
norm,
nobody
has
suggested
that
anybody
lost
their
priority
because
of
this
problem.
the
notice
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
indicates
that
the
notice
provisions
were
not
intended
to
be
jurisdictional.
but
i
don't
rest
on
that
because
i
recognize
that
over
and
beyond
the
jurisdictional
issue,
if
there
was
--
there
can
be
a
problem
of
fairness
and
if
in
fact
the
way
this
notice
was
written,
the
way
the
notice
has
been
traditionally
written,
if
in
fact
it
misled
people
and
caused
the
potential
preference
parties
represented
by
mr.
ely
to
operate
in
a
different
manner
in
which
they
in
fact
operate,
i
would
think
over
and
beyond
the
jurisdictional
matter,
there'd
be
a
question
of
a
common
garnered
variety
fairness
which
would
be
very
serious
one.
but
in
fact,
it's
clear
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
nature
of
a
notice
didn't
mislead
anybody
at
all.
contrary
to
what
mr.
ely
said,
when
the
notice
was
issued,
there
was
an
immediate
protest
by
the
public
power
groups
which
he
says
are
the
predecessors
of
his
applicant.
and
why
did
they
protest?
they
protest
because
they
were
experienced
people
in
this
business
and
they
knew
what
was
going
on.
and
they
were
interested
in
a
dam
at
the
nez
perce
site
and
they
knew
that
they
weren't
going
to
get
a
dam
at
the
nez
perce
site
if
they
got
a
dam
where
the
preliminary
permit
was.
now,
it
suggested
that
if
the
commission's
notice
had
made
more
clear
what
everybody
knew,
what
the
--
what
certainly
the
notice
didn't
--
in
the
terms
make
clear.
if
the
notice
had
expressly
said
this
permit
while
for
this
proposed
area
obviously
includes
exploration
within
the
reach
of
the
thing
that
may
be
they
would
have
done
something
different.
but
the
record
shows
that
they
wouldn't
have
done
anything
different
and
couldn't
have
done
anything
different
because
of
what
they
were
interested
in.
but
they
were
interested
in
what
they
said
they
were
interested
in
was
not
a
dam
any
place
except
that
nez
perce
and
not
only
is
this
shown
by
what
they
said
in
response
to
the
notice,
but
its
shown
by
what
they
did
when
there
was
an
application
for
high
mountain
sheep
three
years
later.
they
were
very
scornful
of
it.
they
opposed
it.
they
weren't
interested
in
high
mountain
sheep
and
there
isn't
--
they
filed
for
nez
perce.
they
fought
in
a
complete,
hard-fought
battle
before
the
commission
for
a
license
for
nez
perce.
they
didn't
accept
when
it
finally
became
clear
towards
the
end
of
the
licensing
proceeding
that
this
fish
problem
was
more
serious
than
they
felt
it
once,
only
then
that
they
come
in
for
high
mountain
sheep.
and
any
suggestion
that
as
a
practical
matter,
they
would
have
exercised
any
different
preference
rights
if
this
notice
had
said
in
red
letters,
“this
may
include
a
dam
at
high
mountain
sheep
as
well
just
below
the
imnaha
as
well
as
the
one
three
miles
upstream
above
the
imnaha,
thus,
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
about
three
and
a
half
miles,
i
think,
something.
this
gets
me
to
the
final
point
that
i
have
and
that
is
a
matter
which
i
don't
think
is
somewhat
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
color,
and
it
does
give
one
first
looks
at
the
case
considerable
superficial
color
to
the
argument
of
unfairness
which
i
think
is
really
the
essential
argument
that
mr.
ely
is
making
here.
i
don't
--
unless
this
court
wants
to
really
change
the
whole
structure
of
the
act
and
really
inhibit
the
planning
function
which
is
so
essential,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
real
doubt
that
if
the
permit
had
been
followed
by
an
initial
application
for
a
dam
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
that
would
have
been
--
there
would
have
been
any
real
doubt
about
the
matter.
the
coloring
that
makes
this
look
unfair,
if
it
looks
unfair,
is
the
fact
that
the
original
application
that
pacific
northwest
filed
was
not
for
high
mountain
sheep.
that
they
filed
only
for
high
mountain
sheep
at
a
later
stage
after
the
commission
had
turned
down
what
they
thought
was
a
better
plan
but
wasn't.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
as
a
matter
of
definition,
it
is
(inaudible)
high
mountain
sheep
and
the
--
one
of
the
two
dams
was
three
and
a
quarter
miles
from
it
and
the
other
one,
the
pleasant
valley
dam,
which
is
a
two-dam
thing
was
much
further
down,
maybe
24
miles
down.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
upstream,
excuse
me.
i
think,
when
you
look
at
the
actual
situation
that
pacific
northwest
was
faced,
you'll
see
that
they
acted
quite
reasonably
in
this
situation.
it
had
been
convinced
by
it
studies
the
reasons
which
proves
salmon,
that
fish
protection
problems
at
nez
perce
precluded
any
dam
for
that
site.
also
known
that
there
were
other
problems,
less
significant
turned
out
but
real
problems
with
the
dam
at
high
mountain
sheep
because
of
the
imnaha
river.
it
knows
result
of
its
studies
that
you
couldn't
build
a
high
dam
for
geological
reasons
above
the
imnaha.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
imnaha?
excuse
me.
i
always
have
difficulty
with
these
western
names,
so
i'll
have
to
go
out
there
more
frequently.
so
that
despite
the
fact
that
it
knew
that
both
the
commission
staff
and
the
public
groups
out
there
felt
very
strongly
at
that
time
that
the
best
plan
was
a
nez
perce
plan,
it
went
ahead
and
file
its
original
application
for
these
two
dams
prospect.
by
1957,
while
the
permit
was
still
very
much
alive,
it
became
clear
that
the
matter
was
going
to
be
‘touch
and
go'
as
to
whether
the
commission
go
along
with
it.
so,
proposed
--
and
it
ordered
and
the
record
makes
this
clear,
then
ordered
additional
studies
of
the
entire
situation,
the
entire
reach
of
the
river,
including
studies
of
the
dam
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
it
didn't
take
any
action
to
modify
its
license
application
and
i
should
imagine
that
the
main
reason
it
didn't
do
that
is
just
about
this
time,
the
examiner
came
down
with
an
opinion
recommending
that
it
should
be
granted
for
the
license
application.
more
importantly,
it
didn't
file
for
an
amendment
to
its
permit,
not
only
because
it
didn't
think
that
this
was
necessary
but
because
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
it,
the
commission
on
june
17th,
1957,
just
at
this
critical
time,
came
down
with
a
decision,
it
appears
at
17
f.p.c.
834
and
which
is
discussed
at
great
length
both
the
commission
decision
and
in
our
brief,
came
down
with
the
decision
in
the
montana
power
case
and
montana
power
after
all
is
one
of
the
constituent
bodies
of
pacific
northwest
so
very
much
before
them,
came
down
with
a
decision
which
said,
“we
will
not
allow
you.
we
are
precluded
by
the
statute
from
amending
a
permit
to
allow
you
to
explore
within
the
reach
of
the
river
where
you
already
have
a
permit
to
allow
you
to
explore
within
the
reach
of
the
river”.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
not
surprising
that
pacific
northwest
did
not
file
an
amendment
to
their
permit
because
the
commission
had
just
said
that
if
they
did,
it
would
be
turned
down
and
was
unnecessary,
a
permit
necessarily
covered
the
reach
of
the
river.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
the
montana
power
case,
it
meant
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
means
the
part
of
the
river
system
where
any
dam
which
would
be
put
in
one
place
would
be
mutually
exclusive
with
the
dam
in
another
place.
in
context
of
this
case,
it
means
any
dam
on
the
snake
river
from
approximately
the
nez
perce
site
or
sites
to
--
or
down
all
the
way
to
hills
canyon
but
if
you
get
anywhere
clear
around
here,
you're
not
developing
the
thing
anywhere
as
nearly
completely
and
nothing
else
would
have
been
appropriate.
it
means
there
--
it
means
the
reach
of
the
river
which
had
been
agreed
upon
by
these
parties
at
the
beginning
of
their
proceeding
as
being
exactly
what
i
just
said.
so
when
the
commission
in
1957
said,
“you
can't
file
an
amendment
to
your
permit
or
anything
which
will
merely
investigate
the
reach
of
the
river
because
that's
already
in
cover
by
your
permit.
there
was
no
doubt
that
pacific
northwest
have
let
it,
it
had
meant
you
cannot
file
an
amendment
to
your
permit
to
specify
high
mountain
sheep
because
that
isn't
the
reach
of
the
river
and
covered
by
your
permit.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
go
ahead.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
as
we
see
the
statutory
scheme,
here
is
where
–
we're
in
an
estrange
situation
although
we
are
strongly
of
the
view
that
the
permit
here
covered
high
mountain
sheep,
we
don't
treat
permits
as
the
absolute
guarantees
of
licenses
that
the
supply
system
does.
we
treat
a
permit
as
giving
priority
to
the
man
who
has
the
permit
for
license
applications
within
the
reach
of
the
stream
if,
but
only
if,
it
turns
out
in
any
competition
with
other
people
that
their
license
application
is
at
least
as
good
and
by
necessity,
the
best
for
comprehensive
development.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
don't
know
the
geology
or
the
length
of
the
river
or
what
have
you.
certainly,
the
distance
between
nez
perce
and
the
lowest
dam
on
the
river,
that
i
guess
it's
the
original
bonneville
dam,
the
tremendous
difference
in
miles
and
you
don't
have
any
mutual
exclusivity
between
the
dams
say
at
china
gardens,
one
stream,
and
a
dam
at
bonneville
at
the
other
stream.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
if
somebody
had
applied
for
a
high
dam
at
china
gardens
which
is
the
next
dam
down
below
the
nez
perce,
i
should
imagine
that
that
would
have
been
mutually
exclusive
with
the
dam
at
nez
perce
but
it
depends
on
what
they
applied
for
and
what
the
--
it
is
conceivable.
you
cannot,
in
other
words
i
think
we
understand,
you
cannot
talk
in
general
terms
about
what
is
the
common
reach
in
the
river
and
nobody
tried
to.
first
thing
they
did
in
this
case
was
get
together
and
stipulate
what
the
common
reach
of
the
river
is
they
were
talking
about
because
it
varies
depending
on
factual
situation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
--
what
i
am
saying
--
what
was
agreed
here
and
what
i
don't
think
anybody
has
disputed
that
the
common
reach
of
this
river
for
this
case
goes
from
the
nez
perce
site
below
the
confluence
of
the
salmon
and
the
snake,
up
to
whatever
was
necessary
to
develop
that
region
in
the
snake,
the
one
undeveloped
region
of
the
snake
as
mr.
ely
said
up
to
the
head
waters
of
the
brownlee
dam
which
had
already
been
licensed.
and
the
reach
involved
here
--
the
whole
problem
and
maybe
problem
and
reach
are
synonymous
here,
the
problem
here
was
how
best
to
develop
this
area
of
the
snake
river.
well,
i
might
have
exceeded
my
time.
i'll
have
to
let
mr.
smith
answer
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
claiborne
has
made
clear,
the
question
and
the
sole
question
in
this
first
case
today
is
the
propriety
of
the
commission's
exercise
of
it's
judgment
in
this
particular
case
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
recommend
federal
development
because
in
its
opinion
a
license
granted
to
the
private
licensee
would
provide
comprehensive
development
of
the
waterway,
would
in
other
words
meet
the
licensing
standard
of
the
act
which
is
found
not
in
section
7
(b)
of
the
act
but
in
section
10
(a)
a
very
significant
licensing
standard,
one
relatively
unique
among
licensing
standards,
a
planning
licensing
standard.
now,
the
secretary
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
planning.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
a
standard
which
imposes
upon
the
commission
a
responsibility
for
planning.
it's
more
than
just
saying,
do
something
good,
it
says
do
the
best.
now,
the
secretary
is
not
recommending
here
that
you
set
aside
this
judgment
of
the
commission,
he's
saying
merely
that
there
should
be
a
further
hearing
because
in
his
opinion
for
reasons
which
i
will
discuss,
he
believes
that
we
didn't
really
fairly
consider
the
issue
of
section
7
(b).
he
doesn't
argue
or
at
least
he
can't
argue
that
we
didn't
consider
in
terms
as
a
matter
of
7
(b)
not
merely
as
subsumed
within
the
10
(a)
problem.
the
arguments
that
he
made
to
us,
specific
arguments
that
he
made
to
us
in
this
case
is
to
why
federal
development
was
allegedly
superior.
they
were
discussed
at
length
by
the
examiner,
they
were
discussed
at
length
by
the
commission
in
its
decision
and
they
were
discussed
at
length
by
the
commission
again
on
rehearing.
nor
does
anybody
argue
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
that
high
mountain
sheep
plan
of
development
which
the
commission
authorized
here
is
the
best
plan.
it
is
now
agreed
by
the
secretary,
by
the
commission
and
of
course
by
the
other
applicant
who'll
be
up
in
the
next
case
that
this
is
the
best
plan
of
development.
not
only
is
this
the
best
plan
of
development
but
there
isn't
any
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
physical
structures
that
will
be
build
by
the
licensee
will
in
all
material
respects
be
identical
with
the
physical
structures
that
would
be
built
by
the
federal
government
for
it
to
get
the
license.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
so
held
now
immediate
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
no,
no.
immediate
is
relative
since
it
takes
time
to
build
the
dam.
the
commission
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
within
that
relative
thing
the
commission
so
held
the
main
area
of
dispute
between
the
secretary
and
the
commission,
before
the
commission
was
this
very
point.
but
as
mr.
claiborne
is
quite
right,
we
say
the
secretary
now
recognizes
that
there
is
an
immediate
need
for
power
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
express
that
by
not
only
in
what
mr.
claiborne
said
today
but
in
his
announcement
in
his
brief
that
he
is
now
prepared
to
recommend
federal
development
and
will
do
so
as
soon
as
the
commission
clears
the
way
for
him
as
contrasted
with
this
position
before
the
commission
that
federal
development
was
a
bad
thing.
there
are
reasons
for
this
which
i'll
get
to
a
little
later.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this
is
not
a
public
works
program
either
by
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
private
group
or
by
the
department
of
interior.
the
needs
for
power
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
a
very
remote
country
but
the
power
needs
of
the
pacific
northwest
is
i'm
sure
you
know
are
growing
by
tremendous
leaps
and
bounce.
they
have
shortages
of
power
at
the
present
moment
in
the
gas
side.
they
need
this
for
their
build
up
during
this
period.
now,
i
will
show
that
the
sec
--
that
the
commission's
determination
and
on
this
question,
on
the
question
of
federal
versus
private
development
was
based
on
record
information.
i
want
to
note
that
the
secretary
--
the
secretary
has
not
shown
here
by
brief
or
oral
argument
and
he
did
not
show
before
the
commission
any
specific
area
in
which
if
the
record
was
reopened
he
had
something
significant
to
show,
everything
that
we
heard
here
today
and
everything
that
we
heard
below
is
philosophy.
well,
if
we
have
to
open
their
record
for
philosophy
then
i
guess
we
have
to
open
the
record
for
philosophy
but
as
i
will
try
and
show
if
it's
a
matter
of
facts
and
that's
how
this
commission
tried
to
decide
this
case,
the
record
is
complete.
the
secretary's
brief
suggest
in
very
sweeping
term
that
because
this
is
a
major
power
project
and
it
certainly
is
and
because
this
power
project
is
above
a
lot
of
government
power
projects
and
has
to
coordinate
not
only
with
these
projects
that
are
shown
on
these
maps
but
with
the
approximately
a
hundred
and
somewhat
projects
in
the
entire
columbia
river
basin.
that
a
private
party
cannot
be
relied
upon
to
perform
--
to
perform
even
if
no
matter
what
he
builds,
perform
in
a
comprehensive
manner.
but
this
again
is
an
evidentiary.
this
is
philosophy.
this
is
the
public
power
versus
private
power
thing
and
the
only
thing
the
commission
does
believe
about
what
it's
inhibited,
prohibited,
from
deciding
cases
on
the
basis
of,
if
the
philosophy
of
public
power
versus
private
power,
if
the
record
shows
--
if
the
record
shows
that
the
po
--
that
the
federal
government
can
do
it
better
and
not
only
as
a
matter
of
construction
but
as
a
matter
of
operation
then
we're
under
a
statutory
requirement
to
so
recommend
to
the
congress.
if
the
record
shows
that
licensee
applicant
whether
it'd
be
a
private
body
or
a
public
body
can
do
the
record,
do
the
job
as
well,
do
comprehensive
development
that
we
are
under
in
no
obligation
to
make
a
recommendation.
now,
contrary
to
what
has
been
suggested,
throughout
this
proceeding,
the
problem
of
public
versus
private
or
rather
federal
versus
nonfederal
construction
of
this
dam
was
very
much
in
the
case.
in
the
first
place
but
probably
least
important
it's
always
in
commission
cases
and
contrary
to
what
has
been
suggested.
we
always
give
special
consideration
to
whether
or
not
a
project
can
be
operated
and
constructed
better
by
the
federal
government
because
it
is
not
true
that
we're
interested
only
in
the
physical
structure.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir
and
that
is
what
i
intend
to
do
right
here
this
morning.
i'm
going
to
go
through
the
specific.
i'm
not
going
to
talk
generally,
mr.
justice
white.
i
intend
to
discuss
specifically
the
areas
of
this
case
which
are
relevant
to
the
problem
in
this
case
and
show
you
what
was
in
the
record
and
what
the
commission
said
about
it
and
why
it's
right,
because
i
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
section
7
(b)
and
section
10
(a)
are
both
part
of
the
original
act
of
1920.
now,
not
only
is
this
always
a
matter
for
commission
consideration,
it's
a
matter
which
was
very
much
involved
in
this
particular
proceeding.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
involved
commisio
--
mr.
justice
white
in
the
earlier
hearing
for
the
other
license
which
we
will
hear
about
later
on.
this
specifically
involved
and
to
both
the
examiner
and
the
commission
discussed
the
7
(b)
matter
there
and
said
there
was
nothing
that
indicated
that
the
federal
government
could
do
it
better.
what
is
more
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
certainly
direct
their
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
--
no.
there's
a
total
logical
gambit
here.
the
commission
in
the
previous
case
and
in
this
case
doesn't
have
evidence
labeled
7
(b)
evidence
or
labeled
10
(a)
evidence.
its
evidence
doesn't
bear
labels
as
to
the
particular
standard
that's
going
to
be
put
up
against.
but
there
was
evidence
in
the
previous
case
where
it
was
being
argued
they
should
be
federal
development.
there
was
evidence
in
this
case.
and
the
secretary
didn't
invent
the
section
7
(b)
issue
when
after
the
close
of
the
record
he,
for
the
first
time
recommended
federal
development.
on
the
contrary
as
the
examiner
points
out
and
this
is
at
volume
2
of
the
record
at
page
426,
on
the
basis
of
the
record
evidence
the
staff
brief
which
had
been
filed
in
this
case
four
months
before
the
secretary
even
recommended
federal
development.
discussed
the
issues,
discussed
the
evidence
in
the
light
of
the
7
(b)
issue
and
explain
why
he
didn't
believe
that
there
was
any
justification
for
a
7
(b)
recommendation.
but
let
me
not
talk
in
generality
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
the
light
of
the
record
--
hearing
record,
in
his
brief
to
the
examiner,
the
staff
counsel
discussed
the
evidence
not
only
in
terms
of
whether
a
license
should
be
issued
but
whether
in
terms
the
7
(b)
recommendation
should
be
made.
and
he
did
this
because
this
was
not
something
that
is
not
part
of
the
proceeding.
he
knew
it
was
part
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
means
by
that
that
contrary
to
other
situations
where
the
secretary
will
in
their
--
in
his
reports
to
the
commission
which
is
part
of
the
licensing
procedure
recommend
federal
development.
there
had
been
no
recommendation
for
federal
development
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
matter
had
been
canvassed
despite
the
fact
that
the
secretary
had
not
--
not
made
or
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
certainly
it
does
not
connote
it
and
he
discusses
it
at
great
length
and
explains
for
substantive
reasons
and
not
for
procedural
reasons
why
he
doesn't
believe
that
there
was
any
justification
for
federal
development.
i
can't
tell
you
where
it
ends
but
his
discussion
of
federal
development,
the
examiner's
discussion
starts
on
page
426
of
volume
2
of
the
record
that
runs
over
for
about
--
about
10
or
15
pages,
discussing
the
actual
situation
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
do
in
our
brief.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
with
respect
to
each
of
the
particular
areas
we
have
listed
the
page
numbers
of
the
testimony.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
let
me
maybe
turn
to
what
really
is
the
key
issue
as
far
as
federal
development
versus
nonfederal
development
in
this
case
and
explain
who
put
on
the
evidence.
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
flood
control,
navigation,
about
protection
of
fish
resources,
about
recreation,
that
type
of
thing.
all
of
which
get
down
to
the
fact
that
although
the
plans
of
the
licensee
are
as
good
as
anybody
else's
plans
and
although
the
commission
license
itself
provides
not
only
immediate
direction
that
they
must
do
this
continuing
authority
to
insist
on
more
throughout
the
period.
all
of
which
gets
down
to
the
problem
that
it's
contrary
to
their
interest
and
they
won't
do
it.
but
let
me
get
down
to
what
i
think
is
the
major
and
in
my
opinion
the
only
real
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
why
--
the
applicants
--
the
applicants
for
a
license
and
the
corps
of
engineers
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
applicants
for
a
license
for
which
they
were
two
of
them
put
on
the
testimony
and
also
there
were
a
lot
of
witnesses
from
the
various
fish
agencies,
all
the
fish
agencies
in
idaho,
oregon
and
washington,
the
only
fish
agencies
that
didn't
participate
in
the
hearing
where
the
secretary
who
withdrew
his
witnesses.
there
were
the
corp
of
the
engineers
had
its
statement
in
the
record
as
to
flood
control
and
navigation,
it
stated
on
the
record
that
the
dam
that
was
going
to
be
built
was
exactly
the
type
of
the
dam
that
it
would
build
if
it
was
building
one
for
flood
control
and
navigation.
it
recommended
certain
specific
conditions
for
continuing
control
over
this
matter
and
these
conditions
were
imposed
by
the
commission.
as
to
recreation,
there
was
a
flow
of
recreation
plan
that
was
put
into
this
ex
--
evidence
here
prepared
by
the
licensee
after
full
consultation
with
the
far
service
of
the
department
of
agriculture
which
is
the
department
that
has
most
of
the
land
around
this
project
and
again
in
addition
to
this
type
of
evidence,
there
--
the
commission
eventually
added
conditions
of
its
own.
there
was
a
full
hearing
on
all
of
these
problems
that
go
to
comprehensive
development
because
mr.
chief
justice,
obviously,
if
this
licensee
or
any
licensee
were
going
to
build
the
best
dam
in
the
world
but
wasn't
going
to
come
up
with
an
adequate
recreation
plan,
it
would
not
be
comprehensive
development
and
we
would
have
to
deny
the
license
and
if
nobody
else
could
do
it,
we
have
to
recommend
federal
development
who
could
do
it.
and
similarly
with
respect
to
flood
control
and
some
way
with
respect
to
navigation
and
similarly
with
respect
to
fish
resources.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
of
course,
you
may
assume
that
if
they
were
not
anxious
to
put
on
evidence
of
federal
development
but
they
were
anxious
to
put
on
evidence
to
show
for
a
highly
contested
project,
a
very
major
project
to
show
that
they
could
do,
they
could
perform
the
planning
job
of
comprehensive
development
as
well
as
anybody
else.
and
they
put
on
extensive
evidence
to
show
what
they
could
do
in
each
of
these
areas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
there
is
and
that's
what
i'd
like
to
get
here
if
i
may.
the
reason
i
say
it
is
--
it
was
--
it
was
taken
cared
of
during
the
course
of
the
proceeding
but
you
raised
a
very
real
problem.
the
main
issue
as
i
see
it,
the
one
real
indicia
in
this
case
which
might
indicate
that
a
federal
development
here
would
be
more
advantageous
than
a
nonfederal
development,
relates
to
the
coordination
matter.
because
as
mr.
claiborne
indicated,
mr.
claiborne
has
indicated
here
this
is
a
major
dam
with
lots
of
storage
which
can
and
will
and
have
to
be
used
if
you're
going
to
have
optimum
operation
here
to
coordinate
not
only
with
the
federal
dams
downstream
on
the
snake
and
columbia
permit
but
with
all
of
the
dams
in
this
system.
now,
everybody
recognized
that
this
was
one
of
the
key
questions
that
there
was
a
very
serious
problem
as
to
whether
any
licensee
could
do
a
complete
job
on
this
matter
and
the
evidences
quote
of
this
discussion.
first
of
all
that
was
put
into
evidence
discussion
of
the
existing
coordination
situation
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
the
pacific
northwest,
this
involved
the
so
called
northwest
power
pool
of
which
the
bonneville
administration
and
the
other
federal
agencies
as
well
as
all
four
of
the
companies
that
make
up
pacific
northwest
parties.
and
the
witnesses
on
this
matter
recognized
that
there
would
be
considerable
coordination
under
the
present
operation
of
this
pool
but
they
also
realized
and
faced
up
to
the
real
serious
problem
that
full
coordination,
optimum
coordination,
coordination
which
surprisingly
enough
but
very,
very
true
in
this
case
would
help
both
onsite
generation
potentialities
for
the
honor
of
this
project
and
downstream
generation
potentialities
for
the
federal
government
another
downstream
owner.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this,
what
i'm
telling
you
now
is
the
testimony
of
the
applicants,
not
just
this
applicant
but
the
other
applicant.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
what
they
said
was
coordination
under
the
northwest
power
pool
is
pretty
good
but
it
isn't
good
enough.
it'll
produce
great
benefits
downstream
but
it
will
not
produce
the
optimum
benefits
which
we
can
get
out
of
full
coordination
of
this
river
basin.
they
said
particularly
with
the
very
difficult
problem
of
hydraulic
coordination
between
dams,
we're
only
going
to
get
this
when
there's
a
formal
written
agreement
among
all
of
the
various
people
operating
hydro
projects
not
only
on
this
stretch
of
the
river
but
on
the
entire
columbia
river
system
and
of
course
just
eliminates
the
entire
upper
columbia
river.
there
was
disagreement
among
the
parties
as
to
the
likelihood
of
when
this
agreement
would
be
reach.
they
have
started
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
two
applicants.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
now,
there
was
a
disagreement
on
this
matter.
the
present
licensees
thought
that
it
was
likely
that
the
discussions
which
had
started
would
be
completed
by
the
time
any
project
could
get
on
the
line.
the
witness
on
this
subject
for
the
supply
system
was
more
doubtful.
you
assure
that
eventually
the
interest
of
all
parties
in
this
area
was
going
to
lead
to
this
type
of
agreement
but
he
wasn't
sure
that
this
would
be
possible
by
the
time
this
project
got
on
the
air.
everybody
agreed,
however,
that
it
was
coming
and
not
only
because
it
was
feasible
but
because
it
was
in
the
long
range
interest
not
only
of
the
government
and
its
dams
below
but
in
the
long
range
interest
of
every
system
operating
in
this
area.
now,
if
this
had
been
the
state
of
facts
as
of
the
time
the
commission
reached
its
decision,
you
would
have
very
serious
problem
of
exactly
the
type
that
the
government
purports
to
bring
before
you
as
to
whether
the
larger
amount
of
coordination,
a
more
detailed
coordination
which
everybody
admitted
was
necessary
to
get
the
full
benefits
of
this
dam
and
all
the
other
dams
on
the
system
could
be
achieved
through
a
licensing
condition
in
the
license
which
ordered
pacific
northwest
to
fully
coordinate
with
the
other
projects
in
this
area
in
order
to
maximize
power
production.
if
this
had
been
the
case
the
situation
we
would
find
ourselves
in
today
would
be
very
different.
but
it
isn't
the
case.
and
this
i
think
is
very
important
because
the
optimist
of
pacific
northwest
prove
to
be
less
than
full
optimist
in
this
case
as
a
result
of
what
may
be
fortuitous
circumstance
but
as
a
result
of
an
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
canada
for
further
development
of
this
river
basin
in
canada
and
the
united
states.
as
a
re
--
a
factor
came
along
which
with
the
catalytic
agent
and
brought
these
parties
together
probably
several
years
earlier
than
it
otherwise
would
have.
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
canadians
refuse
to
sign
the
treaty
unless
the
united
states
entities
would
agree
to
take
additional
power
which
they
couldn't
use
initially
and
the
united
states
entities
neither
the
federal
one
nor
the
private
one
could
do
it
themselves.
they
forced
themselves
to
get
together
and
one
of
the
very
important
by
place
of
this
was
they
reached
the
coordination
agreement
which
the
testimony
in
this
evidence
said
would
produce,
would
produce
the
full
coordination
of
all
of
the
projects
on
this
river
which
was
necessary
both
to
increase
the
power
supply
at
these
downstream
dams
and
to
increase
the
power
at
this
dam.
now,
this
forced
coordination
agreement
had
been
signed
by
the
time
the
examiner
reached
this
--
decided
the
case.
it
had
been
included,
reference
had
been
included
to
it
in
a
stipulation
of
facts
included
in
the
record
and
the
examiner
puts
great
weight
of.
he
points
out
--
he
points
out
that
with
this
coordination
agreement
the
whole
situation
with
respect
to
the
interrelationships
of
one
project
to
another
had
changed
in
this
area.
and
he
quoted,
mr.
charles
luce
who
was
the
bonneville
administrator
at
that
time
and
is
now
of
course
the
undersecretary
of
interior
is
saying
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
he
has
resigned
to
take
the
job
as
head
of
consolidated
edison
but
i
think
he's
still
sec
--
undersecretary
of
interior.
i
quote
mr.
luce
in
saying
that
“under
this
agreement
all
of
the
generating
facilities
in
the
pacific
northwest
were
operating
as
though
they
were
under
a
single
ownership”.
let
me
read
a
little
more
detail
what
the
bonneville
administration
says
is
happening
under
this
coordination.
bonneville
administration
says
that
under
the
coordination
agreement
the
various,
i'm
reading
from
the
report
issued
by
the
bonneville
administration
in
1964.
this
is
what
they
say
about
this
agreement
and
as
they
say
--
this
is
what
they
say
about
how
things
are
operating
in
this
area
at
the
present
moment.
they
say
under
the
coordination
agreement,
the
various
public
and
private
utilities
and
the
federal
government
agree
to
operate
there
projects
much
as
if
all
were
owned
by
a
single
entity.
for
example,
water
releases
from
storage
projects
which
this
of
course
is
far
excellent
are
carefully
timed
so
they
will
produce
the
maximum
power
at
all
downstream
dams
through
which
they
flow.
thus,
the
owner
of
an
upstream
reservoir
who
might
otherwise
release
stored
water
to
produce
power
to
meet
it's
own
loads
by
the
time
when
the
owner
of
the
downstream
dams
could
not
use
additional
power,
water,
i'm
sorry,
agrees
to
hold
his
storage
for
later
releases
at
such
time
as
it
will
produce
the
most
power
on
an
overall
basis.
in
the
meantime,
the
owner
of
the
upstream
reservoir
is
supplied
power
from
a
downstream
dam
which
has
a
surplus.
on
--
in
other
words,
on
what
we
certainly
would
have
agreed
was
the
most
critical
issue
relevant
not
only
to
comprehensive
development
but
as
to
whether
it
couldn't
be
done
better
by
the
federal
government
and
what
the
testimony
of
the
parties
here
themselves
recognized
was
the
most
serious
issue.
the
facts
are
that
the
dam
is
going
to
be
operated
pursuant
to
this
agreement,
present
agreement
which
i
have
been
lodged
by,
lodged
with
this
court
by
the
secretary
which
i've
given
you
additional
copies
of
which
i
must
apologize
for
its
great
complexity.
this
present
agreement
to
2003
and
under
this
agreement
the
practical
effect
of
the
thing
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
who
owns
this
dam,
whether
it
is
owned
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
or
whether
it's
owned
by
pacific
northwest,
it's
going
to
be
operated
in
exactly
the
same
way
because
it's
going
to
be
operated
under
this
agreement.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
as
to
power
only
with
this
exception.
the
coordination
agreement
expressly
subordinates
the
operation
of
all
dams
on
this
river
including
pacific
northwest
for
which
the
coordinate
--
court
--
the
pacific
northwest
is
not
now
a
member
of
the
coordination
agreement.
but
in
anticipation
of
the
licensing
of
pacific
northwest,
the
coordination
agreement
expressly
provides
for
pacific
northwest
becoming
a
member
sets
up
the
terms
in
which
it'll
become
a
member
and
it's
clear
it
will
not
be
entitled
to
certain
headwater
benefits
that
other
people
would
be.
and
provides
it
can
become
a
member
and
pacific
northwest,
of
course,
have
said
it
will
become
a
member
because
in
it's
best
interest
to
do
so.
this
is
a
power
coordination
agreement
but
the
power
coordination
agreement
expressly
recognizes
that
all
power
coordination
on
the
columbia
river
has
to
be
subordinated
to
flood
control
and
navigation
and
to
the
other
non-power
needs
that
might
come
up.
for
example,
you
can
speculate
into
the
future
as
to
what
might
possibly
happen
one
development
which
has
been
mentioned
from
time
to
time
in
the
newspapers
is
the
possibility
of
diverting
water
from
the
columbia
snake
system,
thousands
of
miles
down
south.
nobody
can
say
at
this
stage
and
again
whether
this
will
ever
come
about.
but
if
it
does,
it's
provided
for
in
this
license
and
the
licensee
has
agreed
to
take
this
license
subject
to
all
the
versions
of
water
that
might
subsequently
be
ordered.
and
well,
when
you
get
to
problem
like
fish
or
recreation,
the
coordination
agreement
really
isn't
relevant
to
it.
this
is
all
part
of
the
license,
a
separate
licensing
scheme.
i've
mentioned
that
pacific
northwest
can
and
will
become
a
party
to
this
agreement
so
i
will
not
discuss
further
the
--
run
a
tenacious
argument
that
because
of
the
licensee
of
the
upstream
brownlee
project
hasn't
become
a
member,
we
can't
be
assured
that
pacific
northwest
will.
i
do
want
to
see
briefly
mention
the
other
principle
argument
that
was
made
at
least
in
the
brief
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
technically
i
think
you're
reading
from
the
part
of
section
7
(b)
which
says
what
the
commission
should
do
after
it
makes
the
7
(b)
recommendation.
if
the
commission
decides
to
recommend
7
(b)
to
--
under
7
(b)
to
make
a
recommendation
for
federal
development
since
congress
must
rely
on
the
commission,
the
language
we're
reading
from
makes
clear
that
we
shouldn't
just
give
a
bare
recommendation
but
should
give
details
to
it.
but
the
language
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir.
if
--
if
the
record
in
this
case
was
not
adequate
to
allow
the
commission
to
make
a
really
informed
judgment
as
to
whether
they
were
adding
advantages
to
federal
development
which
couldn't
be
met
by
the
license
here
then
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
some
merit
to
the
argument
of
the
secretary
that
the
case
should
be
reopened.
what
i
am
saying
is
if
the
record
is
comprehensive
on
the
matters
relating
to
this
issue
and
that
the
secretary
has
not
ever
and
has
not
here
today
suggested
any
area
where
it
isn't.
i
do
not
suggest
that
the
commission
is
operating
correctly.
the
commission
is
performing
its
planning
function.
if
it
makes
a
7
(b)
determination
on
the
basis
of
it
inadequate
record
which
will
not
allow
it
to
canvass
all
the
real
areas
relevant
to
the
problem
of
whether
there
should
be
federal
development
versus
nonfederal
development
and
merely
gets
this.
on
the
contrary,
what
i
am
saying
if
the
commission
did
hear
as
it
must
do
is
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
and
record
that
it
has
before
it.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
called
witnesses
from
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
called
witnesses
from
its
own
staff,
it
called
witnesses
from
the
fish
agencies
up
in
the
northwest,
it
called
witnesses
from
all
sorts
of
areas,
it
happened
to
have
called
witnesses
from
the
department
of
interior
which
was
subsequently
withdrawn.
but
i
don't
make
a
point
in
that.
if
the
witnesses
which
had
been
withdrawn
by
the
department
of
interior,
i
didn't
know
that
a
very
bad
thing
and
a
horrible
a
piece
of
administration
but
if
the
witnesses
that
were
withdrawn
by
the
secretary
of
interior
were
essential
to
make
an
adequate
record
upon
which
the
commission
could
decide
whether
there
was
a
justification
for
federal
development,
i'm
afraid
i
would
have
to
agree
with
mr.
claiborne
that
even
at
this
very
late
stage
we
would
have
--
have
to
reopen
the
record.
but
they
didn't
suggest
that.
when
they
finally
asked
us
to
reopen
the
record
they
didn't
say
we'll
bring
these
witnesses
back
because
these
witnesses
will
lead
to
the
fish
problem
which
there
were
then
agreements.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
know.
mr.
smith
may,
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
you
have
to
ask
mr.
smith,
i
just
don't
know.
one
--
there
were
three
witnesses,
one
of
them
was
dealing
with,
one
of
the
three
witnesses
was
to
testify
on
why
the
secretary
thought
there
was
no
need
for
power.
that
evidence
is
obviously
inconsistent
with
his
position
now.
as
to
the
fish
evidence,
i
just
can't
tell
you.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
corps
of
engineers
did
not
testify.
the
corps
of
engineers
submitted
a
formal
report
of
the
chief
of
engineers
which
was
placed
in
the
record
and
which
is
the
basis
of
the
commission's
determination
with
respect
to
flood
control
and
navigation
and
as
i
said
i
think
when
you're
out
the
chief
of
engineers
that
we
would
build
the
dam
exactly
this
way,
we
want
these
special
provisions
in
the
license
so
that
they
will
operate
in
the
proper
way
and
these
provisions
are
in
fact
in
the
license.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
absolutely,
yes
of
course.
let
me
say
that
the
coordination
agreement
has
been
alleged
to
be
incomplete
because
it
doesn't
provide
for
hourly
water
releases
to
meet
the
hourly
swings
of
the
downstream
dam.
now,
this
is
just
a
misunderstanding
of
how
coordination
offers.
water
travels
at
approximately
five
miles
an
hour
and
these
dams
are
a
lot
further
apart
than
they
show
on
this
map
and
you
cannot
get
coordination
by
opening
and
closing
this
loose
gates
minute
by
minute
or
hour
by
hour
basis
and
expect
water
is
going
to
be
downstream
on
time.
what
you
do
is
you
plan
in
advance
under
this
agreement
so
that
there
will
be
sufficient
bondage
below
--
above
all
of
these
dams
so
that
they
can
take
care
of
their
expected
swings
within
a
period.
now,
my
time
is
running
out
and
i
just
want
to
say
one
final
thing
about
the
point
raised
by
justice
white
a
little
earlier
and
that
is
about
the
relevance
of
the
fact
that
the
secretary
here
was
not
recommending
federal
development,
was
recommending
that
there'd
be
a
deferral
of
this
question.
it
is
untrue
to
say
that
the
commission's
decision
is
based
on
that
and
that
this
was
the
only
reason
that
the
commission
voted
against
federal
development.
when
you
read
the
commission
decision,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
is
not
the
case.
the
commission
did
say
justice
white
and
justice
black
that
the
secretary's
disinclination
to
build
the
dam
which
the
commission
felt
was
necessary
and
which
he
now
recognizes
as
necessary
was
an
additional
factor
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
make
a
federal
--
a
recommendation
for
federal
development.
and
of
course
this
isn't
a
very
surprising
position
because
this
was
exactly
what
this
court
has
held
in
the
case
of
chapman
versus
the
fpc
345
u.s.
at
153.
it
is
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
federal
development
that
the
secretary
of
interior
who
in
this
case
is
the
federal
agency
who
would
build
any
federal
development
was
not
interested
in
building
it.
whatever
the
difficulties
are
in
getting
federal
development
when
there
are
private
or
public
groups
other
than
the
federal
government
willing
to
perform
the
job
and
willing
to
do
a
comprehensive
job,
whatever
those
difficulties
are.
i
need
not
point
out
that
the
last
vast
made
more
difficult
for
the
secretary
himself
has
no
interest
in
immediate
development.
let
me
conclude
why
--
what
i
said
at
the
beginning.
arguments
i'm
sure
can
be
made,
have
been
made
in
the
past
and
will
be
made
for
many
years
to
come
that
any
major
hydroelectric
project
of
this
nature
should
as
a
matter
of
philosophy
be
built
by
the
federal
government
rather
than
under
licensed
by
a
commission
licensee.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
evidence.
this
is
not
something
that
if
you
reopen
the
case
and
we
listen
to
people
discuss
that
philosophy
is
going
to
advance
the
ball.
it
certainly
not
something
which
the
commission
was
required
to
make
a
federal
recommendation
because
a
policy
question
is
one
for
congress.
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
act
is
based
upon
a
congress
conception
that
comprehensive
development
including
multipurpose
dams
of
this
nature
can
be
achieved
by
licensing
under
the
federal
power
commission.
and
of
course
one
of
the
main
reasons
that
can
be
done
--
done
is
everybody
realizes
that
when
you
have
a
dam
like
this
which
is
such
a
valuable
dam
which
is
approximately
according
to
the
record
$4
million
a
year
cheaper
than
the
ultimate
source
of
power
that
they
could
get,
that
it
is
to
the
interest
of
private
people
to
do
a
comprehensive
job.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
original
coordination
agreement
was
september
1961.
this
is
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
coordination
bill.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this
one
wants
the
(inaudible).
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
i
may
say
i
am
slightly
surprised
by
the
final
peroration
of
counsel
for
the
supply
system
here.
i
had
thought
up
to
the
time
of
about
ten
minutes
ago
that
the
supply
system
thought
that
if
it
were
to
get
a
license
that
it
could
do
a
job
in
the
public
interest
which
would
be
meet
the
test
of
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
and
by
hypothesis
would
be
as
good
as
anybody
else.
i
gather
now
they
had
some
doubts
about
that.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
preliminary
permit
issued
to
pacific
northwest
served
to
give
it
priority
for
an
application
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
as
the
commission
held.
if
it
did
--
pardon
me
--
if
it
did
not,
if
there
was
no
priority
which
followed
to
this
new
application,
then
we
would
agree
that
the
case
has
to
be
remanded
not
for
the
reason
mr.
ely
suggested
at
the
very
end
but
because
as
the
commission
held,
mr.
ely's
client,
the
supply
system,
is
a
municipality
and
has
certain
rights
of
second
chance
rights
under
the
statute.
there
are
very
serious
questions
in
this
record
as
the
commission
found
as
to
the
qualifications
of
the
supply
system.
the
commission
found
as
mr.
justice
douglas
had
mentioned
before
that
although
they
were
a
municipality
of
washington,
they
had
not
demonstrated
that
they
were
qualified
to
build
and
operate
a
dam
in
this
area.
the
commission
also
found
that
on
the
record
made
before
it,
they
had
not
shown
their
market
for
the
power
or
they
had
not
shown
their
financial
qualifications
to
build
it.
but
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
what
i'm
saying.
what
--
under
the
statutory
scheme
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
they
have
to
show
it
but
under
the
statutory
scheme,
as
a
preference
applicant,
assuming
they're
otherwise
legally
qualified,
they
would
have
a
second
chance
and
therefore
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right
because
they
would
have
this
second
chance.
they
said
there's
grave
doubts
about
it.
they
haven't
shown
it
now
but
that
is
not
grounds
for
denying
these
people
if
there
is
no
priority
here
then
these
people
have
a
second
chance.
and
this
is
true,
they
have
this
second
chance.
although
throughout
most
of
this
proceeding,
they
were
bitterly
opposing
the
application
for
a
dam
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
the
best
way
of
comprehensive
development.
now
the
commission's
reasons
for
believing
that
pacific
northwest
has
a
priority
for
the
high
mountain
sheep
project,
rest
are
our
views
of
the
statutory
structure
of
the
act
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
specifically,
we
think
that
in
order
to
make
any
sense
out
of
the
preliminary
permit
part
of
the
act,
you
must
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
three-year
permit
issued
to
pacific
northwest
in
1955,
though
it
in
terms
described
a
proposed
project
consisting
of
two
dams
at
mountain
sheep
and
pleasant
valley,
necessarily
provided
priority
for
any
application
filed
by
pacific
northwest
within
the
statutory
period
in
the
relevant
--
into
the
river.
and
this
what
the
language
of
section
4
or
5
of
the
act
is
talking
about.
it
is
a
person
who
owned
--
holds
a
preliminary
permit
as
a
statutory
priority
for
subsequent
license
applications
within
the
term
of
that
permit.
as
i
indicated
in
my
argument
in
the
previous
case,
we're
dealing
here
with
an
essential
licensing
standard
under
section
10
(a)
of
the
act,
which
impresses
a
specific
planning
function
on
the
commission
and
would
be
applicants.
operations
in
the
public
interest,
a
normal
licensing
or
certificate
standard
just
aren't
good
enough
best
adapted
to
a
comprehensive
plan
for
a
waterway
is
what
somebody
has
to
show.
and
while
congress
was
convinced
that
in
most
cases,
these
objectives
could
be
met
by
issuing
licenses
to
non-federal
entities,
be
they
private
groups
or
public
groups.
it
also
recognized
that
there
is
a
planning
that
has
to
be
(voice
overlap)
undertaken
and
that
a
reasonable
degree
of
priority
is
absolutely
essential
if
this
planning
is
going
to
be
undertaken.
it's
for
this
reason
that
we
have
this
otherwise
estranged
dual
structure
in
this
act.
we
don't'
really
have
a
licensing
scheme,
we
have
superimposed
on
this
licensing
scheme
the
separate
procedure
for
preliminary
permits
to
provide
priority
for
subsequent
license
applications.
and
it's
for
the
same
reason,
we
think,
that
the
suggestions
by
the
supply
system
that
the
scope
of
a
permit
must
be
limited
to
the
discreet
form
of
project
with
the
applicant
for
a
permit
tentatively
think
is
going
to
be
the
best
one
before
he
makes
his
investigations
would
work
against
the
statutory
scheme
not
in
favor.
one
minor
problem
with
that
is
that
if
the
permits
are
going
to
be
narrowly
limited
then
the
whole
idea
of
limiting
the
term
of
permits
is
--
can
be
avoided.
you
can
issue
successive
permits
tying
up
a
river
for
slightly
different
areas.but
more
important,
more
important,
if
you
require
the
person
seeking
a
permit
to
know
before
he
gets
his
permit,
the
exact
location
he's
going
to
build
in,
at
the
risk,
if
he
moves
from
there
or
if
he
builds
a
higher
dam
or
if
he
otherwise
changes
his
proposal,
he
loses
his
priority
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
believe
that
a
permit
covers
the
reach,
the
common
reach
of
the
stream.
this
case,
as
i
would
get
into
in
the
few
minutes,
it
covered
nez
perce,
it
covered
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
it
covered
the
mountain
sheep
site
and
it
covered
this
combination
thing,
it
covered
--
to
put
it
more
specifically,
the
area
which
was
in
dispute,
which
everybody
knew
was
in
dispute
from
all
time.
now
obviously
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
a
permit
--
obviously
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
obviously,
it
does
not
cover
the
salmon
river
at
all.it
is
true.
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
projects
within
this
reach
of
the
river,
specifically
the
nez
perce
project,
if
it
had
been
built,
would
have
been
mutually
inconsistent
with
some
of
the
dams
on
the
salmon.
but
we
do
not
suggest
and
nobody
has
suggested
that
a
permit
to
explore
the
snake
river
covers
with
it
a
priority
on
the
salmon
river.
now,
let
me
make
it
clear
that
i
am
not
talking
theory.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh!
yes,
we
do
make
provisions
for
amendments
of
the
permits
and
i'll
get
to
that
later
in
my
argument
to
where
that's
appropriate,
where
it
isn't
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
obviously
an
important
part
of
the
picture.
what
i
will
try
to
argue
is
that
amendments
are
not
intended
to
get
an
amendment
to
a
permit
every
time
you
change
your
plans
or
at
least
if
it
is
intended
for
this,
nobody
has
ever
known.
this
licensing
scheme
has
been
in
effect
for
47
years.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
with
example,
the
fact
is
that
change
and
significant
change,
sometimes
as
much
as
putting
in
completely
new
dams,
change
between
the
times
somebody
applies
for
a
permit
and
the
times
somebody
applies
for
a
license,
is
the
norm,
not
the
exception.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
sure
there
is,
but
you
have
to
ask
mr.
smith.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh,
no.
the
license
is
issued
for
50
years
but
the
dam
last
a
hundred
years.
at
least,
as
far
as
i
know,
with
very
exceptional
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
this
is
a
very
unusual
situation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
--
nobody
suggest
that
this
dam
will
not
to
be
there
at
the
end
of
a
license
period
50
years
from
now
and
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
the
normal
--
i
understand,
but
the
normal
depreciation
on
this
type
of
dam
which
is
worked
out
by
the
engineers
in
the
light
of
everything
you're
saying
is
approximately
75
to
a
100
years.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
you
have
to
add
--
there
are
--
you're
beyond
my
competence.
i
can
only
tell
you
that
everything
we
know
is
that
this
dam
like
all
other
major
projects
has
a
life
at
least
the
length
of
the
license
and
probably
closer
to
twice
the
length
of
the
license.
now,
i've
said
the
change
is
standard
between
the
time
you
apply
for
a
permit
and
the
time
you
get
--
you
apply
for
a
license.
but
that
really
understates
the
situation.
actually,
change
in
the
planning
mechanism
that's
involved
in
getting
a
license
from
the
federal
power
commission
doesn't
stop
with
the
license
application.
it
continues
throughout
the
licensing
process.
in
fact,
and
so
insistent
are
we
that
what
is
built
is
consistent
with
a
--
latest
developments
that
change
goes
on
after
the
licensing
proceeding.
the
only
type
of
situation
in
fact
in
which
it
can
be
expected
that
there
will
be
no
change
between
the
time
somebody
applies
for
preliminary
permit
and
the
time
he
gets
--
applies
for
a
license
is
in
the
circumstances
where
there's
no
need
for
any
further
investigation
because
the
plans
were
already
made.
and
in
this
type
of
situation,
the
commission
has
held
in
the
georgia
power
case
which
is
cited
on
page
82
of
our
brief
that
there's
no
basis
for
granting
a
permit
at
all.
now,
in
our
opinion,
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
this
necessary
plan
to
give
a
permit
to
explore
and
change
and
do
what
has
to
be
done
during
the
licensing
process
with
the
provisions,
the
equally
important
provisions
of
section
7
(a)
of
the
act,
which
give
preference
to
state
and
municipal
bodies.
now
on
the
contrary,
as
mr.
ely
quite
rightly
said,
the
one
area
in
which
they
do
not
have
permit
is
where
there
is
an
outstanding
preliminary
permit
covering
the
area.
preference
bodies
have
and
it's
very
important
to
have,
preference
for
getting
permits.
and
this
is
not
a
theoretical
right.
our
records
indicate
that
of
the
20
outstanding
permits
at
the
present
moment,
no
less
than
eight
of
them
are
held
by
preference
bodies,
including
a
number
of
preference
bodies
who
are
part
of
the
supply
system
itself.
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
during
the
course
of
the
history
in
which
there
have
been
actual
conflicts
between
a
private
group
and
a
preference
group,
seeking
a
preliminary
permit
and
where,
pursuant
to
the
preference
the
permit
for
the
exploration
giving
it
the
priority
has
gone
to
the
preference
body.
moreover,
it
is
incorrect
to
say
that
the
granting
of
a
permit
and
the
priority
it
carries
guarantees
a
license
to
the
party
who
has
got
the
priority,
this
is
well-illustrated,
probably
as
well-illustrated
as
any
given
case
by
the
facts
of
this
proceeding.
in
our
judgment,
as
we
made
clear
in
our
brief,
and
i'll
find
may
clear
in
this
argument,
pacific
northwest
had
a
priority
as
i
said
for
the
stretch
of
the
river
here
and
this
included
the
nez
perce
site
for
all
the
confluence
of
the
salmon
and
the
snake
river.
however,
it
did
not
file
an
application
for
any
project
based
at
nez
perce
within
the
three-year
period
of
its
permit.
who
did?
the
supply
system
did
and
we
had
a
comparative
case
between
the
supply
system
that
was
seeking
and
continued
to
seek
right
through
this
proceeding
a
license
for
nez
perce
and
pacific
northwest
which
had
applied
for
high
mountain
sheep.
now
despite
the
fact
that
the
priority
would've
covered
a
timely
filed
license
application
for
the
pacific
northwest
for
nez
perce,
since
they
didn't
file
one,
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
commission
had
agreed
with
the
basic
premise
of
the
supply
system
in
this
case,
that
a
dam
on
the
nez
perce
was
the
best
way
of
comprehensive
development,
that
the
power
matters
there,
outweighed
the
fish
matters
which
the
commission
doesn't
agree
with,
that
the
supply
system
would
have
won
this
case.
in
fact,
in
our
opinion,
they
would
have
won
the
case.
despite
the
priority,
despite
the
priority
for
the
nez
--
for
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
if
in
fact
pacific
northwest
had
filed
a
license
application
for
an
inadequate
development
based
on
high
mountain
sheep,
and
if
in
fact
the
belated
application
filed
by
the
supply
system
for
high
mountain
sheep
had
prescribed
a
superior
plan
of
operation,
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i'm
getting
to
that
right
now.
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
ely
does
suggest
that
exactly
that
happened.
in
fact,
very
strong
words
were
used
by
the
commission,
we're
alleged
to
have
expropriated
the
superior
plan
that
the
supply
system
had
for
high
mountain
sheep
and
give
it
to
unwillingly
i
guess
to
pacific
northwest.
now
the
facts
of
this
whole
discussion
are
very
simple.
both
parties
here,
in
the
beginning
of
their
--
at
least
from
the
time
they
applied
for
high
mountain
sheep
have
applied
for
major
comprehensive
dams
where
the
eventual
power
supply
of
2,000,000
kilowatts.
the
supply
system's
application
was
filed
two
years
after
pacific
northwest
almost
the
end
of
the
hearing,
called
for
generators
with
a
higher
capacity
than
the
generators
which
the
supply
--
in
which
pacific
northwest
had
originally
applied
for.
but
the
commission
held
that
this
was
not
a
significant
difference
between
the
two
parties.
expressly
held,
it's
not
a
significant
difference
between
the
two
parties
since
it
was
also
clear
on
this
record
that
pacific
northwest
had
stated
that
while
they
had
included
in
their
application
generators
of
the
type
which
were
then
be
available
at
the
time
they
made
their
application
that
they
are
in
fact
were
prepared
to
include
in
the
dam
when
they
got
it,
whatever
the
highest
rating,
the
feasible
generator
was
at
that
time.
so
that
the
commission,
contrary
to
what
mr.
ely
said,
expressly
finds
that
as
between
the
two
high
mountain
sheep
plants,
there
was
no
material
difference.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
problem
of
the
permit
and
the
situation
when
the
permit
was
issued.
i
would
agree
with
most
to
what
mr.
ely
said
about
facts
here
with
one
minor
exception.
everybody
knew
that
there
was
going
to
be
one
major
project
somewhere
in
the
area
here
and
there
were
three
or
four
potential
sites
for
it.
all
of
which
had
been
discussed.
there
was
the
nez
perce
site,
which
had
the
fish
problem,
turned
out
it
has
some
geological
problems
also.
there
was
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
which
had
a
lesser
fish
problem
but
still
a
fish
problem
and
there
were
the
sites
above
the
imnaha
and
again
i
have
to
use
the
term
mountain
sheep
because
that
--
it
happens
to
be
a
site
that
a
name
which
goes
both
above
and
below
the
imnaha.
i
wouldn't
agree
with
mr.
ely
when
he
said
it
was
clear
at
the
time
of
the
permit
that
any
site
above
the
imnaha
would
have
to
be
a
two
dam
site
with
the
major
dam
at
pleasant
valley.
there
was
dispute
as
to
this.
one
of
the
two
reports
included
in
the
chief
of
engineer's
report
had
said
a
high
dam
at
the
mountain
sheep
site
above
the
confluence
of
imnaha
was
feasible,
the
other
one
had
suggested
there
were
grave
doubts
as
to
the
geology
there
whether
it
would
support
a
high
dam.
it
was
an
issue
as
far
from
resolved
and
in
fact
one
of
the
major
things
that
was
done
by
pacific
northwest
during
the
permit
was
to
study
this
problem.
and
they
found
out
that
of
these
two
reports,
the
one
that
said
there
were
geological
faults
was
quite
right
and
that
a
high
dam
just
above
the
imnaha
was
not
feasible.
now,
the
permit
application
that
was
filed
by
pacific
northwest
here,
in
conformance
with
the
expressed
commission
rules,
specified
a
very
detailed
proposed
project.
the
reason
for
this,
the
reason
for
this
is
because
section
24
of
the
act
provides
an
automatic
land
withdrawal
of
all
lands
affected
by
any
application
for
a
preliminary
permit.
this
has
created
a
very
serious
problem
of
land
management
which
the
commission
over
the
years
in
cooperation
with
the
federal
agencies
involved
in
land
management
has
resolved
by
requiring
a
very
detailed
and
limited
application
for
preliminary
permit
to
avoid
unnecessary
land
withdrawals.
this
of
course
is
a
compromise
that
means
you
don't
have
land
withdrawals
beyond
the
best
estimate
--
guesstimate
of
where
the
most
likely
side
is
but
the
commission's
policy
which
the
secretary
as
i
understand
his
footnote
in
his
brief
strongly
supports
is
that
it
is
essential
that
these
land
withdrawals
be
kept
to
an
absolute
minimum.
the
traditional
commission
notice
of
application
during
the
47
years
of
operation
under
the
statute
has
similarly
been
limited
to
the
specific
terms
of
the
permit
application
and
up
to
this
time,
despite
the
fact
as
i
said,
change
between
the
application
permit
and
the
license
application
say
nothing
of
the
license
as
the
norm,
nobody
has
suggested
that
anybody
lost
their
priority
because
of
this
problem.
the
notice
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
indicates
that
the
notice
provisions
were
not
intended
to
be
jurisdictional.
but
i
don't
rest
on
that
because
i
recognize
that
over
and
beyond
the
jurisdictional
issue,
if
there
was
--
there
can
be
a
problem
of
fairness
and
if
in
fact
the
way
this
notice
was
written,
the
way
the
notice
has
been
traditionally
written,
if
in
fact
it
misled
people
and
caused
the
potential
preference
parties
represented
by
mr.
ely
to
operate
in
a
different
manner
in
which
they
in
fact
operate,
i
would
think
over
and
beyond
the
jurisdictional
matter,
there'd
be
a
question
of
a
common
garnered
variety
fairness
which
would
be
very
serious
one.
but
in
fact,
it's
clear
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
nature
of
a
notice
didn't
mislead
anybody
at
all.
contrary
to
what
mr.
ely
said,
when
the
notice
was
issued,
there
was
an
immediate
protest
by
the
public
power
groups
which
he
says
are
the
predecessors
of
his
applicant.
and
why
did
they
protest?
they
protest
because
they
were
experienced
people
in
this
business
and
they
knew
what
was
going
on.
and
they
were
interested
in
a
dam
at
the
nez
perce
site
and
they
knew
that
they
weren't
going
to
get
a
dam
at
the
nez
perce
site
if
they
got
a
dam
where
the
preliminary
permit
was.
now,
it
suggested
that
if
the
commission's
notice
had
made
more
clear
what
everybody
knew,
what
the
--
what
certainly
the
notice
didn't
--
in
the
terms
make
clear.
if
the
notice
had
expressly
said
this
permit
while
for
this
proposed
area
obviously
includes
exploration
within
the
reach
of
the
thing
that
may
be
they
would
have
done
something
different.
but
the
record
shows
that
they
wouldn't
have
done
anything
different
and
couldn't
have
done
anything
different
because
of
what
they
were
interested
in.
but
they
were
interested
in
what
they
said
they
were
interested
in
was
not
a
dam
any
place
except
that
nez
perce
and
not
only
is
this
shown
by
what
they
said
in
response
to
the
notice,
but
its
shown
by
what
they
did
when
there
was
an
application
for
high
mountain
sheep
three
years
later.
they
were
very
scornful
of
it.
they
opposed
it.
they
weren't
interested
in
high
mountain
sheep
and
there
isn't
--
they
filed
for
nez
perce.
they
fought
in
a
complete,
hard-fought
battle
before
the
commission
for
a
license
for
nez
perce.
they
didn't
accept
when
it
finally
became
clear
towards
the
end
of
the
licensing
proceeding
that
this
fish
problem
was
more
serious
than
they
felt
it
once,
only
then
that
they
come
in
for
high
mountain
sheep.
and
any
suggestion
that
as
a
practical
matter,
they
would
have
exercised
any
different
preference
rights
if
this
notice
had
said
in
red
letters,
“this
may
include
a
dam
at
high
mountain
sheep
as
well
just
below
the
imnaha
as
well
as
the
one
three
miles
upstream
above
the
imnaha,
thus,
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
about
three
and
a
half
miles,
i
think,
something.
this
gets
me
to
the
final
point
that
i
have
and
that
is
a
matter
which
i
don't
think
is
somewhat
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
color,
and
it
does
give
one
first
looks
at
the
case
considerable
superficial
color
to
the
argument
of
unfairness
which
i
think
is
really
the
essential
argument
that
mr.
ely
is
making
here.
i
don't
--
unless
this
court
wants
to
really
change
the
whole
structure
of
the
act
and
really
inhibit
the
planning
function
which
is
so
essential,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
real
doubt
that
if
the
permit
had
been
followed
by
an
initial
application
for
a
dam
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
that
would
have
been
--
there
would
have
been
any
real
doubt
about
the
matter.
the
coloring
that
makes
this
look
unfair,
if
it
looks
unfair,
is
the
fact
that
the
original
application
that
pacific
northwest
filed
was
not
for
high
mountain
sheep.
that
they
filed
only
for
high
mountain
sheep
at
a
later
stage
after
the
commission
had
turned
down
what
they
thought
was
a
better
plan
but
wasn't.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
as
a
matter
of
definition,
it
is
(inaudible)
high
mountain
sheep
and
the
--
one
of
the
two
dams
was
three
and
a
quarter
miles
from
it
and
the
other
one,
the
pleasant
valley
dam,
which
is
a
two-dam
thing
was
much
further
down,
maybe
24
miles
down.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
upstream,
excuse
me.
i
think,
when
you
look
at
the
actual
situation
that
pacific
northwest
was
faced,
you'll
see
that
they
acted
quite
reasonably
in
this
situation.
it
had
been
convinced
by
it
studies
the
reasons
which
proves
salmon,
that
fish
protection
problems
at
nez
perce
precluded
any
dam
for
that
site.
also
known
that
there
were
other
problems,
less
significant
turned
out
but
real
problems
with
the
dam
at
high
mountain
sheep
because
of
the
imnaha
river.
it
knows
result
of
its
studies
that
you
couldn't
build
a
high
dam
for
geological
reasons
above
the
imnaha.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
imnaha?
excuse
me.
i
always
have
difficulty
with
these
western
names,
so
i'll
have
to
go
out
there
more
frequently.
so
that
despite
the
fact
that
it
knew
that
both
the
commission
staff
and
the
public
groups
out
there
felt
very
strongly
at
that
time
that
the
best
plan
was
a
nez
perce
plan,
it
went
ahead
and
file
its
original
application
for
these
two
dams
prospect.
by
1957,
while
the
permit
was
still
very
much
alive,
it
became
clear
that
the
matter
was
going
to
be
‘touch
and
go'
as
to
whether
the
commission
go
along
with
it.
so,
proposed
--
and
it
ordered
and
the
record
makes
this
clear,
then
ordered
additional
studies
of
the
entire
situation,
the
entire
reach
of
the
river,
including
studies
of
the
dam
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
it
didn't
take
any
action
to
modify
its
license
application
and
i
should
imagine
that
the
main
reason
it
didn't
do
that
is
just
about
this
time,
the
examiner
came
down
with
an
opinion
recommending
that
it
should
be
granted
for
the
license
application.
more
importantly,
it
didn't
file
for
an
amendment
to
its
permit,
not
only
because
it
didn't
think
that
this
was
necessary
but
because
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
it,
the
commission
on
june
17th,
1957,
just
at
this
critical
time,
came
down
with
a
decision,
it
appears
at
17
f.p.c.
834
and
which
is
discussed
at
great
length
both
the
commission
decision
and
in
our
brief,
came
down
with
the
decision
in
the
montana
power
case
and
montana
power
after
all
is
one
of
the
constituent
bodies
of
pacific
northwest
so
very
much
before
them,
came
down
with
a
decision
which
said,
“we
will
not
allow
you.
we
are
precluded
by
the
statute
from
amending
a
permit
to
allow
you
to
explore
within
the
reach
of
the
river
where
you
already
have
a
permit
to
allow
you
to
explore
within
the
reach
of
the
river”.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
not
surprising
that
pacific
northwest
did
not
file
an
amendment
to
their
permit
because
the
commission
had
just
said
that
if
they
did,
it
would
be
turned
down
and
was
unnecessary,
a
permit
necessarily
covered
the
reach
of
the
river.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
the
montana
power
case,
it
meant
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
means
the
part
of
the
river
system
where
any
dam
which
would
be
put
in
one
place
would
be
mutually
exclusive
with
the
dam
in
another
place.
in
context
of
this
case,
it
means
any
dam
on
the
snake
river
from
approximately
the
nez
perce
site
or
sites
to
--
or
down
all
the
way
to
hills
canyon
but
if
you
get
anywhere
clear
around
here,
you're
not
developing
the
thing
anywhere
as
nearly
completely
and
nothing
else
would
have
been
appropriate.
it
means
there
--
it
means
the
reach
of
the
river
which
had
been
agreed
upon
by
these
parties
at
the
beginning
of
their
proceeding
as
being
exactly
what
i
just
said.
so
when
the
commission
in
1957
said,
“you
can't
file
an
amendment
to
your
permit
or
anything
which
will
merely
investigate
the
reach
of
the
river
because
that's
already
in
cover
by
your
permit.
there
was
no
doubt
that
pacific
northwest
have
let
it,
it
had
meant
you
cannot
file
an
amendment
to
your
permit
to
specify
high
mountain
sheep
because
that
isn't
the
reach
of
the
river
and
covered
by
your
permit.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
go
ahead.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
as
we
see
the
statutory
scheme,
here
is
where
–
we're
in
an
estrange
situation
although
we
are
strongly
of
the
view
that
the
permit
here
covered
high
mountain
sheep,
we
don't
treat
permits
as
the
absolute
guarantees
of
licenses
that
the
supply
system
does.
we
treat
a
permit
as
giving
priority
to
the
man
who
has
the
permit
for
license
applications
within
the
reach
of
the
stream
if,
but
only
if,
it
turns
out
in
any
competition
with
other
people
that
their
license
application
is
at
least
as
good
and
by
necessity,
the
best
for
comprehensive
development.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
don't
know
the
geology
or
the
length
of
the
river
or
what
have
you.
certainly,
the
distance
between
nez
perce
and
the
lowest
dam
on
the
river,
that
i
guess
it's
the
original
bonneville
dam,
the
tremendous
difference
in
miles
and
you
don't
have
any
mutual
exclusivity
between
the
dams
say
at
china
gardens,
one
stream,
and
a
dam
at
bonneville
at
the
other
stream.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
if
somebody
had
applied
for
a
high
dam
at
china
gardens
which
is
the
next
dam
down
below
the
nez
perce,
i
should
imagine
that
that
would
have
been
mutually
exclusive
with
the
dam
at
nez
perce
but
it
depends
on
what
they
applied
for
and
what
the
--
it
is
conceivable.
you
cannot,
in
other
words
i
think
we
understand,
you
cannot
talk
in
general
terms
about
what
is
the
common
reach
in
the
river
and
nobody
tried
to.
first
thing
they
did
in
this
case
was
get
together
and
stipulate
what
the
common
reach
of
the
river
is
they
were
talking
about
because
it
varies
depending
on
factual
situation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
--
what
i
am
saying
--
what
was
agreed
here
and
what
i
don't
think
anybody
has
disputed
that
the
common
reach
of
this
river
for
this
case
goes
from
the
nez
perce
site
below
the
confluence
of
the
salmon
and
the
snake,
up
to
whatever
was
necessary
to
develop
that
region
in
the
snake,
the
one
undeveloped
region
of
the
snake
as
mr.
ely
said
up
to
the
head
waters
of
the
brownlee
dam
which
had
already
been
licensed.
and
the
reach
involved
here
--
the
whole
problem
and
maybe
problem
and
reach
are
synonymous
here,
the
problem
here
was
how
best
to
develop
this
area
of
the
snake
river.
well,
i
might
have
exceeded
my
time.
i'll
have
to
let
mr.
smith
answer
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
claiborne
has
made
clear,
the
question
and
the
sole
question
in
this
first
case
today
is
the
propriety
of
the
commission's
exercise
of
it's
judgment
in
this
particular
case
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
recommend
federal
development
because
in
its
opinion
a
license
granted
to
the
private
licensee
would
provide
comprehensive
development
of
the
waterway,
would
in
other
words
meet
the
licensing
standard
of
the
act
which
is
found
not
in
section
7
(b)
of
the
act
but
in
section
10
(a)
a
very
significant
licensing
standard,
one
relatively
unique
among
licensing
standards,
a
planning
licensing
standard.
now,
the
secretary
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
planning.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
a
standard
which
imposes
upon
the
commission
a
responsibility
for
planning.
it's
more
than
just
saying,
do
something
good,
it
says
do
the
best.
now,
the
secretary
is
not
recommending
here
that
you
set
aside
this
judgment
of
the
commission,
he's
saying
merely
that
there
should
be
a
further
hearing
because
in
his
opinion
for
reasons
which
i
will
discuss,
he
believes
that
we
didn't
really
fairly
consider
the
issue
of
section
7
(b).
he
doesn't
argue
or
at
least
he
can't
argue
that
we
didn't
consider
in
terms
as
a
matter
of
7
(b)
not
merely
as
subsumed
within
the
10
(a)
problem.
the
arguments
that
he
made
to
us,
specific
arguments
that
he
made
to
us
in
this
case
is
to
why
federal
development
was
allegedly
superior.
they
were
discussed
at
length
by
the
examiner,
they
were
discussed
at
length
by
the
commission
in
its
decision
and
they
were
discussed
at
length
by
the
commission
again
on
rehearing.
nor
does
anybody
argue
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
that
high
mountain
sheep
plan
of
development
which
the
commission
authorized
here
is
the
best
plan.
it
is
now
agreed
by
the
secretary,
by
the
commission
and
of
course
by
the
other
applicant
who'll
be
up
in
the
next
case
that
this
is
the
best
plan
of
development.
not
only
is
this
the
best
plan
of
development
but
there
isn't
any
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
physical
structures
that
will
be
build
by
the
licensee
will
in
all
material
respects
be
identical
with
the
physical
structures
that
would
be
built
by
the
federal
government
for
it
to
get
the
license.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
so
held
now
immediate
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
no,
no.
immediate
is
relative
since
it
takes
time
to
build
the
dam.
the
commission
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
within
that
relative
thing
the
commission
so
held
the
main
area
of
dispute
between
the
secretary
and
the
commission,
before
the
commission
was
this
very
point.
but
as
mr.
claiborne
is
quite
right,
we
say
the
secretary
now
recognizes
that
there
is
an
immediate
need
for
power
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
express
that
by
not
only
in
what
mr.
claiborne
said
today
but
in
his
announcement
in
his
brief
that
he
is
now
prepared
to
recommend
federal
development
and
will
do
so
as
soon
as
the
commission
clears
the
way
for
him
as
contrasted
with
this
position
before
the
commission
that
federal
development
was
a
bad
thing.
there
are
reasons
for
this
which
i'll
get
to
a
little
later.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this
is
not
a
public
works
program
either
by
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
private
group
or
by
the
department
of
interior.
the
needs
for
power
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
a
very
remote
country
but
the
power
needs
of
the
pacific
northwest
is
i'm
sure
you
know
are
growing
by
tremendous
leaps
and
bounce.
they
have
shortages
of
power
at
the
present
moment
in
the
gas
side.
they
need
this
for
their
build
up
during
this
period.
now,
i
will
show
that
the
sec
--
that
the
commission's
determination
and
on
this
question,
on
the
question
of
federal
versus
private
development
was
based
on
record
information.
i
want
to
note
that
the
secretary
--
the
secretary
has
not
shown
here
by
brief
or
oral
argument
and
he
did
not
show
before
the
commission
any
specific
area
in
which
if
the
record
was
reopened
he
had
something
significant
to
show,
everything
that
we
heard
here
today
and
everything
that
we
heard
below
is
philosophy.
well,
if
we
have
to
open
their
record
for
philosophy
then
i
guess
we
have
to
open
the
record
for
philosophy
but
as
i
will
try
and
show
if
it's
a
matter
of
facts
and
that's
how
this
commission
tried
to
decide
this
case,
the
record
is
complete.
the
secretary's
brief
suggest
in
very
sweeping
term
that
because
this
is
a
major
power
project
and
it
certainly
is
and
because
this
power
project
is
above
a
lot
of
government
power
projects
and
has
to
coordinate
not
only
with
these
projects
that
are
shown
on
these
maps
but
with
the
approximately
a
hundred
and
somewhat
projects
in
the
entire
columbia
river
basin.
that
a
private
party
cannot
be
relied
upon
to
perform
--
to
perform
even
if
no
matter
what
he
builds,
perform
in
a
comprehensive
manner.
but
this
again
is
an
evidentiary.
this
is
philosophy.
this
is
the
public
power
versus
private
power
thing
and
the
only
thing
the
commission
does
believe
about
what
it's
inhibited,
prohibited,
from
deciding
cases
on
the
basis
of,
if
the
philosophy
of
public
power
versus
private
power,
if
the
record
shows
--
if
the
record
shows
that
the
po
--
that
the
federal
government
can
do
it
better
and
not
only
as
a
matter
of
construction
but
as
a
matter
of
operation
then
we're
under
a
statutory
requirement
to
so
recommend
to
the
congress.
if
the
record
shows
that
licensee
applicant
whether
it'd
be
a
private
body
or
a
public
body
can
do
the
record,
do
the
job
as
well,
do
comprehensive
development
that
we
are
under
in
no
obligation
to
make
a
recommendation.
now,
contrary
to
what
has
been
suggested,
throughout
this
proceeding,
the
problem
of
public
versus
private
or
rather
federal
versus
nonfederal
construction
of
this
dam
was
very
much
in
the
case.
in
the
first
place
but
probably
least
important
it's
always
in
commission
cases
and
contrary
to
what
has
been
suggested.
we
always
give
special
consideration
to
whether
or
not
a
project
can
be
operated
and
constructed
better
by
the
federal
government
because
it
is
not
true
that
we're
interested
only
in
the
physical
structure.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir
and
that
is
what
i
intend
to
do
right
here
this
morning.
i'm
going
to
go
through
the
specific.
i'm
not
going
to
talk
generally,
mr.
justice
white.
i
intend
to
discuss
specifically
the
areas
of
this
case
which
are
relevant
to
the
problem
in
this
case
and
show
you
what
was
in
the
record
and
what
the
commission
said
about
it
and
why
it's
right,
because
i
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
section
7
(b)
and
section
10
(a)
are
both
part
of
the
original
act
of
1920.
now,
not
only
is
this
always
a
matter
for
commission
consideration,
it's
a
matter
which
was
very
much
involved
in
this
particular
proceeding.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
involved
commisio
--
mr.
justice
white
in
the
earlier
hearing
for
the
other
license
which
we
will
hear
about
later
on.
this
specifically
involved
and
to
both
the
examiner
and
the
commission
discussed
the
7
(b)
matter
there
and
said
there
was
nothing
that
indicated
that
the
federal
government
could
do
it
better.
what
is
more
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
certainly
direct
their
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
--
no.
there's
a
total
logical
gambit
here.
the
commission
in
the
previous
case
and
in
this
case
doesn't
have
evidence
labeled
7
(b)
evidence
or
labeled
10
(a)
evidence.
its
evidence
doesn't
bear
labels
as
to
the
particular
standard
that's
going
to
be
put
up
against.
but
there
was
evidence
in
the
previous
case
where
it
was
being
argued
they
should
be
federal
development.
there
was
evidence
in
this
case.
and
the
secretary
didn't
invent
the
section
7
(b)
issue
when
after
the
close
of
the
record
he,
for
the
first
time
recommended
federal
development.
on
the
contrary
as
the
examiner
points
out
and
this
is
at
volume
2
of
the
record
at
page
426,
on
the
basis
of
the
record
evidence
the
staff
brief
which
had
been
filed
in
this
case
four
months
before
the
secretary
even
recommended
federal
development.
discussed
the
issues,
discussed
the
evidence
in
the
light
of
the
7
(b)
issue
and
explain
why
he
didn't
believe
that
there
was
any
justification
for
a
7
(b)
recommendation.
but
let
me
not
talk
in
generality
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
the
light
of
the
record
--
hearing
record,
in
his
brief
to
the
examiner,
the
staff
counsel
discussed
the
evidence
not
only
in
terms
of
whether
a
license
should
be
issued
but
whether
in
terms
the
7
(b)
recommendation
should
be
made.
and
he
did
this
because
this
was
not
something
that
is
not
part
of
the
proceeding.
he
knew
it
was
part
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
means
by
that
that
contrary
to
other
situations
where
the
secretary
will
in
their
--
in
his
reports
to
the
commission
which
is
part
of
the
licensing
procedure
recommend
federal
development.
there
had
been
no
recommendation
for
federal
development
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
matter
had
been
canvassed
despite
the
fact
that
the
secretary
had
not
--
not
made
or
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
certainly
it
does
not
connote
it
and
he
discusses
it
at
great
length
and
explains
for
substantive
reasons
and
not
for
procedural
reasons
why
he
doesn't
believe
that
there
was
any
justification
for
federal
development.
i
can't
tell
you
where
it
ends
but
his
discussion
of
federal
development,
the
examiner's
discussion
starts
on
page
426
of
volume
2
of
the
record
that
runs
over
for
about
--
about
10
or
15
pages,
discussing
the
actual
situation
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
do
in
our
brief.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
with
respect
to
each
of
the
particular
areas
we
have
listed
the
page
numbers
of
the
testimony.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
let
me
maybe
turn
to
what
really
is
the
key
issue
as
far
as
federal
development
versus
nonfederal
development
in
this
case
and
explain
who
put
on
the
evidence.
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
flood
control,
navigation,
about
protection
of
fish
resources,
about
recreation,
that
type
of
thing.
all
of
which
get
down
to
the
fact
that
although
the
plans
of
the
licensee
are
as
good
as
anybody
else's
plans
and
although
the
commission
license
itself
provides
not
only
immediate
direction
that
they
must
do
this
continuing
authority
to
insist
on
more
throughout
the
period.
all
of
which
gets
down
to
the
problem
that
it's
contrary
to
their
interest
and
they
won't
do
it.
but
let
me
get
down
to
what
i
think
is
the
major
and
in
my
opinion
the
only
real
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
why
--
the
applicants
--
the
applicants
for
a
license
and
the
corps
of
engineers
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
applicants
for
a
license
for
which
they
were
two
of
them
put
on
the
testimony
and
also
there
were
a
lot
of
witnesses
from
the
various
fish
agencies,
all
the
fish
agencies
in
idaho,
oregon
and
washington,
the
only
fish
agencies
that
didn't
participate
in
the
hearing
where
the
secretary
who
withdrew
his
witnesses.
there
were
the
corp
of
the
engineers
had
its
statement
in
the
record
as
to
flood
control
and
navigation,
it
stated
on
the
record
that
the
dam
that
was
going
to
be
built
was
exactly
the
type
of
the
dam
that
it
would
build
if
it
was
building
one
for
flood
control
and
navigation.
it
recommended
certain
specific
conditions
for
continuing
control
over
this
matter
and
these
conditions
were
imposed
by
the
commission.
as
to
recreation,
there
was
a
flow
of
recreation
plan
that
was
put
into
this
ex
--
evidence
here
prepared
by
the
licensee
after
full
consultation
with
the
far
service
of
the
department
of
agriculture
which
is
the
department
that
has
most
of
the
land
around
this
project
and
again
in
addition
to
this
type
of
evidence,
there
--
the
commission
eventually
added
conditions
of
its
own.
there
was
a
full
hearing
on
all
of
these
problems
that
go
to
comprehensive
development
because
mr.
chief
justice,
obviously,
if
this
licensee
or
any
licensee
were
going
to
build
the
best
dam
in
the
world
but
wasn't
going
to
come
up
with
an
adequate
recreation
plan,
it
would
not
be
comprehensive
development
and
we
would
have
to
deny
the
license
and
if
nobody
else
could
do
it,
we
have
to
recommend
federal
development
who
could
do
it.
and
similarly
with
respect
to
flood
control
and
some
way
with
respect
to
navigation
and
similarly
with
respect
to
fish
resources.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
of
course,
you
may
assume
that
if
they
were
not
anxious
to
put
on
evidence
of
federal
development
but
they
were
anxious
to
put
on
evidence
to
show
for
a
highly
contested
project,
a
very
major
project
to
show
that
they
could
do,
they
could
perform
the
planning
job
of
comprehensive
development
as
well
as
anybody
else.
and
they
put
on
extensive
evidence
to
show
what
they
could
do
in
each
of
these
areas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
there
is
and
that's
what
i'd
like
to
get
here
if
i
may.
the
reason
i
say
it
is
--
it
was
--
it
was
taken
cared
of
during
the
course
of
the
proceeding
but
you
raised
a
very
real
problem.
the
main
issue
as
i
see
it,
the
one
real
indicia
in
this
case
which
might
indicate
that
a
federal
development
here
would
be
more
advantageous
than
a
nonfederal
development,
relates
to
the
coordination
matter.
because
as
mr.
claiborne
indicated,
mr.
claiborne
has
indicated
here
this
is
a
major
dam
with
lots
of
storage
which
can
and
will
and
have
to
be
used
if
you're
going
to
have
optimum
operation
here
to
coordinate
not
only
with
the
federal
dams
downstream
on
the
snake
and
columbia
permit
but
with
all
of
the
dams
in
this
system.
now,
everybody
recognized
that
this
was
one
of
the
key
questions
that
there
was
a
very
serious
problem
as
to
whether
any
licensee
could
do
a
complete
job
on
this
matter
and
the
evidences
quote
of
this
discussion.
first
of
all
that
was
put
into
evidence
discussion
of
the
existing
coordination
situation
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
the
pacific
northwest,
this
involved
the
so
called
northwest
power
pool
of
which
the
bonneville
administration
and
the
other
federal
agencies
as
well
as
all
four
of
the
companies
that
make
up
pacific
northwest
parties.
and
the
witnesses
on
this
matter
recognized
that
there
would
be
considerable
coordination
under
the
present
operation
of
this
pool
but
they
also
realized
and
faced
up
to
the
real
serious
problem
that
full
coordination,
optimum
coordination,
coordination
which
surprisingly
enough
but
very,
very
true
in
this
case
would
help
both
onsite
generation
potentialities
for
the
honor
of
this
project
and
downstream
generation
potentialities
for
the
federal
government
another
downstream
owner.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this,
what
i'm
telling
you
now
is
the
testimony
of
the
applicants,
not
just
this
applicant
but
the
other
applicant.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
what
they
said
was
coordination
under
the
northwest
power
pool
is
pretty
good
but
it
isn't
good
enough.
it'll
produce
great
benefits
downstream
but
it
will
not
produce
the
optimum
benefits
which
we
can
get
out
of
full
coordination
of
this
river
basin.
they
said
particularly
with
the
very
difficult
problem
of
hydraulic
coordination
between
dams,
we're
only
going
to
get
this
when
there's
a
formal
written
agreement
among
all
of
the
various
people
operating
hydro
projects
not
only
on
this
stretch
of
the
river
but
on
the
entire
columbia
river
system
and
of
course
just
eliminates
the
entire
upper
columbia
river.
there
was
disagreement
among
the
parties
as
to
the
likelihood
of
when
this
agreement
would
be
reach.
they
have
started
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
two
applicants.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
now,
there
was
a
disagreement
on
this
matter.
the
present
licensees
thought
that
it
was
likely
that
the
discussions
which
had
started
would
be
completed
by
the
time
any
project
could
get
on
the
line.
the
witness
on
this
subject
for
the
supply
system
was
more
doubtful.
you
assure
that
eventually
the
interest
of
all
parties
in
this
area
was
going
to
lead
to
this
type
of
agreement
but
he
wasn't
sure
that
this
would
be
possible
by
the
time
this
project
got
on
the
air.
everybody
agreed,
however,
that
it
was
coming
and
not
only
because
it
was
feasible
but
because
it
was
in
the
long
range
interest
not
only
of
the
government
and
its
dams
below
but
in
the
long
range
interest
of
every
system
operating
in
this
area.
now,
if
this
had
been
the
state
of
facts
as
of
the
time
the
commission
reached
its
decision,
you
would
have
very
serious
problem
of
exactly
the
type
that
the
government
purports
to
bring
before
you
as
to
whether
the
larger
amount
of
coordination,
a
more
detailed
coordination
which
everybody
admitted
was
necessary
to
get
the
full
benefits
of
this
dam
and
all
the
other
dams
on
the
system
could
be
achieved
through
a
licensing
condition
in
the
license
which
ordered
pacific
northwest
to
fully
coordinate
with
the
other
projects
in
this
area
in
order
to
maximize
power
production.
if
this
had
been
the
case
the
situation
we
would
find
ourselves
in
today
would
be
very
different.
but
it
isn't
the
case.
and
this
i
think
is
very
important
because
the
optimist
of
pacific
northwest
prove
to
be
less
than
full
optimist
in
this
case
as
a
result
of
what
may
be
fortuitous
circumstance
but
as
a
result
of
an
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
canada
for
further
development
of
this
river
basin
in
canada
and
the
united
states.
as
a
re
--
a
factor
came
along
which
with
the
catalytic
agent
and
brought
these
parties
together
probably
several
years
earlier
than
it
otherwise
would
have.
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
canadians
refuse
to
sign
the
treaty
unless
the
united
states
entities
would
agree
to
take
additional
power
which
they
couldn't
use
initially
and
the
united
states
entities
neither
the
federal
one
nor
the
private
one
could
do
it
themselves.
they
forced
themselves
to
get
together
and
one
of
the
very
important
by
place
of
this
was
they
reached
the
coordination
agreement
which
the
testimony
in
this
evidence
said
would
produce,
would
produce
the
full
coordination
of
all
of
the
projects
on
this
river
which
was
necessary
both
to
increase
the
power
supply
at
these
downstream
dams
and
to
increase
the
power
at
this
dam.
now,
this
forced
coordination
agreement
had
been
signed
by
the
time
the
examiner
reached
this
--
decided
the
case.
it
had
been
included,
reference
had
been
included
to
it
in
a
stipulation
of
facts
included
in
the
record
and
the
examiner
puts
great
weight
of.
he
points
out
--
he
points
out
that
with
this
coordination
agreement
the
whole
situation
with
respect
to
the
interrelationships
of
one
project
to
another
had
changed
in
this
area.
and
he
quoted,
mr.
charles
luce
who
was
the
bonneville
administrator
at
that
time
and
is
now
of
course
the
undersecretary
of
interior
is
saying
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
he
has
resigned
to
take
the
job
as
head
of
consolidated
edison
but
i
think
he's
still
sec
--
undersecretary
of
interior.
i
quote
mr.
luce
in
saying
that
“under
this
agreement
all
of
the
generating
facilities
in
the
pacific
northwest
were
operating
as
though
they
were
under
a
single
ownership”.
let
me
read
a
little
more
detail
what
the
bonneville
administration
says
is
happening
under
this
coordination.
bonneville
administration
says
that
under
the
coordination
agreement
the
various,
i'm
reading
from
the
report
issued
by
the
bonneville
administration
in
1964.
this
is
what
they
say
about
this
agreement
and
as
they
say
--
this
is
what
they
say
about
how
things
are
operating
in
this
area
at
the
present
moment.
they
say
under
the
coordination
agreement,
the
various
public
and
private
utilities
and
the
federal
government
agree
to
operate
there
projects
much
as
if
all
were
owned
by
a
single
entity.
for
example,
water
releases
from
storage
projects
which
this
of
course
is
far
excellent
are
carefully
timed
so
they
will
produce
the
maximum
power
at
all
downstream
dams
through
which
they
flow.
thus,
the
owner
of
an
upstream
reservoir
who
might
otherwise
release
stored
water
to
produce
power
to
meet
it's
own
loads
by
the
time
when
the
owner
of
the
downstream
dams
could
not
use
additional
power,
water,
i'm
sorry,
agrees
to
hold
his
storage
for
later
releases
at
such
time
as
it
will
produce
the
most
power
on
an
overall
basis.
in
the
meantime,
the
owner
of
the
upstream
reservoir
is
supplied
power
from
a
downstream
dam
which
has
a
surplus.
on
--
in
other
words,
on
what
we
certainly
would
have
agreed
was
the
most
critical
issue
relevant
not
only
to
comprehensive
development
but
as
to
whether
it
couldn't
be
done
better
by
the
federal
government
and
what
the
testimony
of
the
parties
here
themselves
recognized
was
the
most
serious
issue.
the
facts
are
that
the
dam
is
going
to
be
operated
pursuant
to
this
agreement,
present
agreement
which
i
have
been
lodged
by,
lodged
with
this
court
by
the
secretary
which
i've
given
you
additional
copies
of
which
i
must
apologize
for
its
great
complexity.
this
present
agreement
to
2003
and
under
this
agreement
the
practical
effect
of
the
thing
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
who
owns
this
dam,
whether
it
is
owned
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
or
whether
it's
owned
by
pacific
northwest,
it's
going
to
be
operated
in
exactly
the
same
way
because
it's
going
to
be
operated
under
this
agreement.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
as
to
power
only
with
this
exception.
the
coordination
agreement
expressly
subordinates
the
operation
of
all
dams
on
this
river
including
pacific
northwest
for
which
the
coordinate
--
court
--
the
pacific
northwest
is
not
now
a
member
of
the
coordination
agreement.
but
in
anticipation
of
the
licensing
of
pacific
northwest,
the
coordination
agreement
expressly
provides
for
pacific
northwest
becoming
a
member
sets
up
the
terms
in
which
it'll
become
a
member
and
it's
clear
it
will
not
be
entitled
to
certain
headwater
benefits
that
other
people
would
be.
and
provides
it
can
become
a
member
and
pacific
northwest,
of
course,
have
said
it
will
become
a
member
because
in
it's
best
interest
to
do
so.
this
is
a
power
coordination
agreement
but
the
power
coordination
agreement
expressly
recognizes
that
all
power
coordination
on
the
columbia
river
has
to
be
subordinated
to
flood
control
and
navigation
and
to
the
other
non-power
needs
that
might
come
up.
for
example,
you
can
speculate
into
the
future
as
to
what
might
possibly
happen
one
development
which
has
been
mentioned
from
time
to
time
in
the
newspapers
is
the
possibility
of
diverting
water
from
the
columbia
snake
system,
thousands
of
miles
down
south.
nobody
can
say
at
this
stage
and
again
whether
this
will
ever
come
about.
but
if
it
does,
it's
provided
for
in
this
license
and
the
licensee
has
agreed
to
take
this
license
subject
to
all
the
versions
of
water
that
might
subsequently
be
ordered.
and
well,
when
you
get
to
problem
like
fish
or
recreation,
the
coordination
agreement
really
isn't
relevant
to
it.
this
is
all
part
of
the
license,
a
separate
licensing
scheme.
i've
mentioned
that
pacific
northwest
can
and
will
become
a
party
to
this
agreement
so
i
will
not
discuss
further
the
--
run
a
tenacious
argument
that
because
of
the
licensee
of
the
upstream
brownlee
project
hasn't
become
a
member,
we
can't
be
assured
that
pacific
northwest
will.
i
do
want
to
see
briefly
mention
the
other
principle
argument
that
was
made
at
least
in
the
brief
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
technically
i
think
you're
reading
from
the
part
of
section
7
(b)
which
says
what
the
commission
should
do
after
it
makes
the
7
(b)
recommendation.
if
the
commission
decides
to
recommend
7
(b)
to
--
under
7
(b)
to
make
a
recommendation
for
federal
development
since
congress
must
rely
on
the
commission,
the
language
we're
reading
from
makes
clear
that
we
shouldn't
just
give
a
bare
recommendation
but
should
give
details
to
it.
but
the
language
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir.
if
--
if
the
record
in
this
case
was
not
adequate
to
allow
the
commission
to
make
a
really
informed
judgment
as
to
whether
they
were
adding
advantages
to
federal
development
which
couldn't
be
met
by
the
license
here
then
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
some
merit
to
the
argument
of
the
secretary
that
the
case
should
be
reopened.
what
i
am
saying
is
if
the
record
is
comprehensive
on
the
matters
relating
to
this
issue
and
that
the
secretary
has
not
ever
and
has
not
here
today
suggested
any
area
where
it
isn't.
i
do
not
suggest
that
the
commission
is
operating
correctly.
the
commission
is
performing
its
planning
function.
if
it
makes
a
7
(b)
determination
on
the
basis
of
it
inadequate
record
which
will
not
allow
it
to
canvass
all
the
real
areas
relevant
to
the
problem
of
whether
there
should
be
federal
development
versus
nonfederal
development
and
merely
gets
this.
on
the
contrary,
what
i
am
saying
if
the
commission
did
hear
as
it
must
do
is
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
and
record
that
it
has
before
it.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
called
witnesses
from
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
called
witnesses
from
its
own
staff,
it
called
witnesses
from
the
fish
agencies
up
in
the
northwest,
it
called
witnesses
from
all
sorts
of
areas,
it
happened
to
have
called
witnesses
from
the
department
of
interior
which
was
subsequently
withdrawn.
but
i
don't
make
a
point
in
that.
if
the
witnesses
which
had
been
withdrawn
by
the
department
of
interior,
i
didn't
know
that
a
very
bad
thing
and
a
horrible
a
piece
of
administration
but
if
the
witnesses
that
were
withdrawn
by
the
secretary
of
interior
were
essential
to
make
an
adequate
record
upon
which
the
commission
could
decide
whether
there
was
a
justification
for
federal
development,
i'm
afraid
i
would
have
to
agree
with
mr.
claiborne
that
even
at
this
very
late
stage
we
would
have
--
have
to
reopen
the
record.
but
they
didn't
suggest
that.
when
they
finally
asked
us
to
reopen
the
record
they
didn't
say
we'll
bring
these
witnesses
back
because
these
witnesses
will
lead
to
the
fish
problem
which
there
were
then
agreements.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
know.
mr.
smith
may,
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
you
have
to
ask
mr.
smith,
i
just
don't
know.
one
--
there
were
three
witnesses,
one
of
them
was
dealing
with,
one
of
the
three
witnesses
was
to
testify
on
why
the
secretary
thought
there
was
no
need
for
power.
that
evidence
is
obviously
inconsistent
with
his
position
now.
as
to
the
fish
evidence,
i
just
can't
tell
you.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
corps
of
engineers
did
not
testify.
the
corps
of
engineers
submitted
a
formal
report
of
the
chief
of
engineers
which
was
placed
in
the
record
and
which
is
the
basis
of
the
commission's
determination
with
respect
to
flood
control
and
navigation
and
as
i
said
i
think
when
you're
out
the
chief
of
engineers
that
we
would
build
the
dam
exactly
this
way,
we
want
these
special
provisions
in
the
license
so
that
they
will
operate
in
the
proper
way
and
these
provisions
are
in
fact
in
the
license.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
absolutely,
yes
of
course.
let
me
say
that
the
coordination
agreement
has
been
alleged
to
be
incomplete
because
it
doesn't
provide
for
hourly
water
releases
to
meet
the
hourly
swings
of
the
downstream
dam.
now,
this
is
just
a
misunderstanding
of
how
coordination
offers.
water
travels
at
approximately
five
miles
an
hour
and
these
dams
are
a
lot
further
apart
than
they
show
on
this
map
and
you
cannot
get
coordination
by
opening
and
closing
this
loose
gates
minute
by
minute
or
hour
by
hour
basis
and
expect
water
is
going
to
be
downstream
on
time.
what
you
do
is
you
plan
in
advance
under
this
agreement
so
that
there
will
be
sufficient
bondage
below
--
above
all
of
these
dams
so
that
they
can
take
care
of
their
expected
swings
within
a
period.
now,
my
time
is
running
out
and
i
just
want
to
say
one
final
thing
about
the
point
raised
by
justice
white
a
little
earlier
and
that
is
about
the
relevance
of
the
fact
that
the
secretary
here
was
not
recommending
federal
development,
was
recommending
that
there'd
be
a
deferral
of
this
question.
it
is
untrue
to
say
that
the
commission's
decision
is
based
on
that
and
that
this
was
the
only
reason
that
the
commission
voted
against
federal
development.
when
you
read
the
commission
decision,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
is
not
the
case.
the
commission
did
say
justice
white
and
justice
black
that
the
secretary's
disinclination
to
build
the
dam
which
the
commission
felt
was
necessary
and
which
he
now
recognizes
as
necessary
was
an
additional
factor
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
make
a
federal
--
a
recommendation
for
federal
development.
and
of
course
this
isn't
a
very
surprising
position
because
this
was
exactly
what
this
court
has
held
in
the
case
of
chapman
versus
the
fpc
345
u.s.
at
153.
it
is
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
federal
development
that
the
secretary
of
interior
who
in
this
case
is
the
federal
agency
who
would
build
any
federal
development
was
not
interested
in
building
it.
whatever
the
difficulties
are
in
getting
federal
development
when
there
are
private
or
public
groups
other
than
the
federal
government
willing
to
perform
the
job
and
willing
to
do
a
comprehensive
job,
whatever
those
difficulties
are.
i
need
not
point
out
that
the
last
vast
made
more
difficult
for
the
secretary
himself
has
no
interest
in
immediate
development.
let
me
conclude
why
--
what
i
said
at
the
beginning.
arguments
i'm
sure
can
be
made,
have
been
made
in
the
past
and
will
be
made
for
many
years
to
come
that
any
major
hydroelectric
project
of
this
nature
should
as
a
matter
of
philosophy
be
built
by
the
federal
government
rather
than
under
licensed
by
a
commission
licensee.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
evidence.
this
is
not
something
that
if
you
reopen
the
case
and
we
listen
to
people
discuss
that
philosophy
is
going
to
advance
the
ball.
it
certainly
not
something
which
the
commission
was
required
to
make
a
federal
recommendation
because
a
policy
question
is
one
for
congress.
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
act
is
based
upon
a
congress
conception
that
comprehensive
development
including
multipurpose
dams
of
this
nature
can
be
achieved
by
licensing
under
the
federal
power
commission.
and
of
course
one
of
the
main
reasons
that
can
be
done
--
done
is
everybody
realizes
that
when
you
have
a
dam
like
this
which
is
such
a
valuable
dam
which
is
approximately
according
to
the
record
$4
million
a
year
cheaper
than
the
ultimate
source
of
power
that
they
could
get,
that
it
is
to
the
interest
of
private
people
to
do
a
comprehensive
job.
