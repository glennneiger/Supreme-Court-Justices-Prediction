you

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
on
a
stream
below
there,
i
understood
there
were
nine
federal
dams
and
if
suppose
some
--
someone
had
applied
for
one
of
those
dams
and
he
had
been
granted
a
certificate,
would
that
have
preempted
all
those
nine
dams
sites
along
there
so
nobody
else
could
have
come
in
and
applied
for
any
specific
one?
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
the
reach
of
this
stream?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
it
this
way
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
wouldn't
preempt
the
nine,
would
it
preempt
any
other
sites
on
the
stream
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
were
a
little
general
in
saying
what
the
common
reach
of
this
stream
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
distance
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
latter
above
the
confluence
of
the
two
rivers
or
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solomon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
take
the
evidence
on
that
subject
to
specifically
did
they
direct
their
attention
to
that
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
they
suggest
the
lack
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
producing
any
evidence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
do
that,
would
you
mind
answering
justice
black's
question,
i'm
interested
in
it
too.
who
put
on
the
evidence
to
show
that
--
that
they
could
take
care
of
the
navigation
purposes
of
the
river?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
all
of
these
various
other
things
that
the
act
provides
for
flood
control,
navigation
and
a
lot
of
other
things.
now,
who
put
on
that
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
contrary
to
the
evidence
to
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
applicant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
the
parties,
you
mean
the
two
applicants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
as
to
power
only.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that
--
that
argument,
i
just
like
to
ask
you
if
this
evidence
which
you
have
related
to
you
or
related
to
us
constitutes
“such
examinations,
surveys,
reports,
plans
and
estimates
of
the
cost
of
the
proposed
development
as
it
may
find
necessary
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
should
be
done
by
the
federal
government
or
the
--
or
the
--
or
private
applicant”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
do
i
--
do
i
understand
that
--
that
without
doing
anything,
it
seems
the
commission,
in
your
opinion,
should
determine
where
there
--
where
there
should
be
federal
or
private
operation
and
then
if
it
decides
without
evidence
that
it
should
be
done
by
federal
government,
it
should
make
those
examinations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
is
this,
i
don't
know
how
you
proceed
but
did
the
government
or
did
the
commission
call
witnesses
say
from
the
department
of
the
interior
and
from
the
other
department
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
department
of
the
government
to
testify
as
to
all
of
these
matters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
smith,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
smith
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
section
7
(b)
doesn't
--
doesn't
contemplate
that
you
have
an
issue
of
that
kind
between
people
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
federal
government
or
private
--
private
company
can
do
--
do
it
better
in
these
circumstances?
doesn't
--
doesn't
that
contemplate
such
an
--
such
an
issue
being
raised
and
was
there
such
an
issue
raised
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
mr.
claiborne
have
you
looked
up
and
not
to
know
what
was
the
purpose
of
section
7?
what
was
behind
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.

that

yes.
chief

by

you

that

chief

then
do
i
--
do
i
understand
that
--
that
without
doing
anything,
it
seems
the

in

should
determine
where
there

chief

then
is
this,
i

did
