mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subject
matter
of
this
case
and
the
next
one
is
the
construction
of
a
high
dam
on
the
snake
river
between
--
which
forms
the
boundary
between
idaho
and
oregon.
the
snake
river
is
a
major
tributary
of
the
columbia
as
the
--
the
small
maps
which
have
been
distributed
to
the
court
and
blow
up
to
which
will
appear
shortly
will
indicate
the
snake
river
flows
north
of
way
and
then
west
merges
with
the
columbia
which
in
turn
moves
west
and
flows
into
the
pacific
ocean,
just
beyond
portland.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
separately
justice
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
--
they're
now
being
distributed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
to
illustrate
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
douglas,
just
the
first.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
463
which
is
--
the
order
was
reversed
by
order
of
the
court.
the
order
of
the
cases,
this
is
udall
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
versus
federal
power
commission.
the
snake
river
is
represented
on
the
small
map
here.
at
this
point,
it
merges
into
the
columbia
river
which
in
turn
as
to
say
goes
west
and
empties
into
the
pacific
ocean.
we
are
concerned
with
the
70-mile
stretch
of
that
river
approximately
between
the
boundary
of
washington
and
oregon
point
approximately
here
down
to
the
site
of
hells
canyon
dam
which
has
been
licensed
to
the
idaho
power
company,
as
well
as
oxbow
and
brownlee
dam
which
are
owned
and
controlled
by
that
same
company.
the
70-mile
stretch
of
the
snake
river
is
an
ideal
site
for
hydroelectric
dam.
it's
a
deep
gorges
sort
of
canyon
with
the
bottoms
on
both
sides
ready-made
for
the
installation
of
a
high
dam.
yet,
the
700-mile
stretch
will
support
only
one
such
high
dam.
it
is
moreover
the
less
important
site
on
the
snake
columbia
river
for
the
construction
of
this
sort
of
high
regulating
dam.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
petition
on
the
merits
on
behalf
of
the
secretary,
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
number
463.
i
should
point
out
two
other
facts
about
this
area.
one
is
the
confluence
of
the
salmon
river
with
snake.
the
salmon
river
as
its
name
indicates
is
one
of
the
important
fish
resources
of
the
united
states
of
this
area.
also,
the
imnaha
river
to
a
less
extent
is
an
important
to
salmon
sanctuary,
fish-breeding
ground.
in
this
stretch
of
the
river,
there
were
considered
three
possible
sites
for
the
location
of
the
dam.
we're
not
disputing
the
commission's
finding
as
to
the
ultimate
location
but
you
will
hear
much
about
the
three
sites
and
i
might
as
well
locate
them
for
you
now.
the
first
site
for
the
high
dam
was
called
pleasant
valley
and
was
considerably
upstream
from
the
mountain
sheep
site
which
is
shown
on
this
map.
it
was
accompanied
as
all
of
these
high
dams
are
by
a
small
low-regulating
dam
below
it
which
was
the
nominated
low
mountain
sheep.
that's
at
one
extreme,
but
the
other
extreme
was
a
dam
below
downstream
from
the
present
site
called
nez
perce
which
was
to
be
operated
in
conjunction
with
china
gardens,
a
small
dam
below
it
which
is
shown
on
the
map.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice
something
approximating
27
miles.
the
pleasant
valley
site
being
upstream
had
the
least
capability
for
generating
power
because
it
caught
less
water
than
--
than
the
dam
further
downstream.
on
the
other
hand,
it
had
the
advantage
of
being
upstream
from
the
confluents
of
the
salmon
and
imnaha
rivers
and
therefore
would
not
interfere
with
the
fish
runs
up
those
rivers.
the
federal
power
commission
determined
not
to
license
that
site
because
it
did
not
use
the
best
advantage,
the
four
capabilities
of
the
river.
it
indicated
in
its
best
opinion
that
the
ideal
site
was
nez
perce
downstream
at
the
other
extreme.
the
difficulty
with
nez
perce
was
that
while
they
caught
both
the
waters
of
the
salmon
and
of
the
snake,
and
was
therefore
ideal
from
the
point
of
view
of
generating
power,
he
did
interfere
with
the
fish
going
up
to
salmon
and
the
imnaha
river
particularly
at
the
salmon
river.
and
ultimately
for
that
reason,
since
they
had
not
yet
and
still
has
not
been
developed
any
sure
way
of
getting
the
salmon
over
such
a
high
dam,
that
site
was
abandoned.
and
ultimately
the
commission
settled
on
a
compromise
which
is
high
mountain
sheep,
the
dam
shown
here.
and
as
i
say,
no
one
disputes
the
commission's
judgment
in
finding
this
site
more
points
of
view
than
those
preferable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
between
the
salmon
and
the
imnaha,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
salmon
is
by
far
the
most
important
of
fish
breeding
ground.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
there
has
been
devised
or
hopefully
it
will
be
devised
a
way
of
allowing
the
salmon
to
come
up
the
imnaha
by
a
canal
around
the
dam.
but
it
does
--
it
is
upstream
from
the
salmon
and
therefore
it
preserves
that
river
free
of
any
obstruction.
now
this
dam,
the
high
mountain
sheep
dam,
which
has
now
been
licensed
to
the
pacific
northwest
company
by
the
federal
power
commission,
is
a
very
large
dam.
it's
approximately
--
it
will
be
approximately
700
feet
high.
it
will
have
a
reservoir
pool
behind
at
some
760-mile
long.
it
will
hold
--
that
pool
will
hold
some
2-million
acre
feet
of
usable
storage.
it
will
be
a
project
second
to
none
in
the
columbia
river
basin
with
a
single
exception
of
grand
coulee
dam.
because
of
its
size
and
its
location,
this
dam
across
has
a
capability
of
producing
a
very
important
amount
of
power
but
it
also
has
other
very
important
potentials.
it
has
potential
for
flood
control
by
releasing
or
holding
back
the
very
seasonal
waters
of
the
snake
river.
it
has
a
potential
perfecting
navigation
one
way
or
the
other.
it
also
has
possibilities
in
the
area
of
water
quality
control,
irrigation
and
finally
recreation.
there's
one
other
fact
which
to
us
is
the
most
important
which
is
that
by
its
location
and
because
of
its
size,
it
will
dominate
all
the
dams
downstream
on
the
snake
and
the
columbia
river.
that
is
shown
more
graphically
on
this
pert
chart.
here
is
high
mountain
sheep
in
red
and
here
are
nine
dams
below
it,
all
of
which
depend
on
the
flow
of
the
river
and
their
availability
of
water
will
depend
on
the
releases
which
this
high
dam
makes.
now,
as
it
happens,
those
nine
dams
below
the
site
which
has
now
been
licensed
to
this
private
power
company,
all
federal
dams
owned
and
operated
by
the
united
states
through
the
corps
of
engineers
in
collaboration
with
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
china
gardens
has
not
been
licensed
nor
has
it
been
constructed
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
authorized
for
federal
construction
when
the
examiner
in
this
case
indicated
that
high
mountain
sheep
would
be
recommended
for
private
development,
the
congress
deauthorized
china
gardens
assuming
that
each
should
go
in
tandem
with
high
mountain
sheep.
china
gardens,
however,
is
not
at
issue
before
the
court.
perhaps
the
assumption
is
that
it
will
go
as
high
mountain
sheep
levels.
i
have
also
distributed
to
the
members
of
the
court
this
morning
through
the
clerk
the
--
an
abbreviated
chronology
of
the
events
in
this
case,
hopefully
to
spare
the
court
the
need
to
hear
a
full
recitation
of
the
rather
involved
proceedings
that
have
taken
place
in
this
case.
basically,
there
were
two
--
well
three
proceedings.
the
first
was
a
proceeding
by
the
present
licensee
the
pacific
northwest
to
obtain
the
license
for
the
first
site
i
spoke
of,
pleasant
valley.
that
was
in
1954,
they
got
a
preliminary
permit,
they
applied
for
a
license,
that
license
--
preliminary
permit
was
granted,
the
license
was
denied
ultimately
by
the
commission
and
it
was
denied
largely
on
the
ground
that
this
was
too
far
upstream
and
did
not
fully
utilized
the
resources
of
the
stretch
of
the
river.
the
commission
at
that
time
indicating
that
it
would
license
a
project
which
included
nez
perce
much
farther
downstream
but
not
this
pleasant
valley
site
which
did
not
utilize
the
river
to
its
fullest.
accordingly,
a
new
application
was
made
by
pacific
northwest
but
not
for
the
nez
perce,
for
this
intermediate
site
of
high
mountain
sheep.
sometime
later,
the
other
petitioner
here
in
the
next
case,
washington
public
power,
filed
its
own
application
for
nez
perce.
at
its
request,
the
commission
consolidated
these
two
proceedings
and
held
a
comparative
hearing
on
the
two
applicants
and
the
two
sites.
the
secretary
of
interior
had
been
asked
by
the
commission
to
comment
on
these
two
applications
and
he
suggested
the
deferral
of
the
whole
licensing
matter
until
the
fish
problem
could
be
resolved,
also
asserting
that
there
was
no
present
need
for
power
in
the
area
and
therefore
no
occasion
to
grant
a
license
of
this
term.
ultimately,
the
examiner
recommended
for
this
high
mountain
sheep
site,
the
secretary
at
that
point
moved
to
intervene
in
the
proceedings.
he
was
granted
leave
to
file
exemptions
to
the
examiner's
report
in
no
other
sense
was
his
intervention
active.
he
did
file
exceptions.
the
commission
ultimately
agreed
with
the
examiner
and
licensed
this
project
of
high
mountain
sheep
to
the
private
power
company
of
pacific
northwest.
at
that
point,
the
secretary
asked
the
proceedings
to
be
reopened
so
that
he
might
present
evidence
as
to
the
superiority
of
federal
development
of
this
site.
the
commission
delayed
its
opinion
granted
a
pro
forma
rehearing
which
was
simply
a
holding
back
in
its
opinion
for
a
month.
then
without
reopening
the
record,
it
did
reaffirm
its
previous
decision
making
some
changes
with
respect
to
the
conditions
to
be
imposed
in
the
license
--
on
the
licensee.
the
secretary
together
with
the
washington
public
power
system
which
had
all
of
these
applications,
both
appealed,
both
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
affirmed
the
federal
power
commission
and
in
turn
the
secretary
and
the
washington
public
power
system
on
different
grounds
petitioned
here
for
certiorari.
now,
the
issue
we
present
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
has
given
adequate
consideration
to
the
alternative
of
federal
development
of
this
site
at
high
mountain
sheep
rather
than
licensing
it
as
it
did.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
very
little,
mr.
justice
douglas.
up
--
there
are
many
considerations
which
might
suggest
in
this
particular
instance
federal
development.
we
do
not
suggest
that
this
court
decide
of
it,
even
the
court
below
decides
which
is
preferable.
we
simply
say
that
before
the
alternative
of
federal
development
is
brushed
aside,
it
must
be
seriously
considered
by
the
commission
as
a
real
alternative
and
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
on
that
point
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
evidence
of
which
there
was
none
in
this
record.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
--
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
--
the
fish
problem
is
a
serious
problem.
however,
the
present
site
which
saves
the
fish
runs
up
the
salmon
river
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
all
those
who
adhere
a
satisfactory
solution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
they
--
there
are
all
the
advantages
in
this
respect
also
it
seems
to
us
in
federal
development
because
the
department
of
the
interior
is
quite
naturally
more
concerned
in
preserving
the
fish
resource
than
with
the
private
power
applicant.
on
the
other
hand,
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
such
claim
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
must
say
that
experience
apparently
shows
that
the
salmon
have
quite
successfully
managed
to
survive
these
small
federal
dams.
it
is
apparently
established
that
fish
ladders
can
be
constructive
to
allow
the
salmon
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
navigate
over
small
dams
of
this
sort.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
there
are
problems
further
upstream
at
the
brownlee
dam
which
is
an
idaho
power
company
dam
and
they
doubt
this
would
be
problems
that
high
mountain
sheep
no
matter
who
constructed
it
but
the
salmon
run
beyond
the
salmon
river
is
a
very
much
lesser
importance
at
least
now.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
maybe
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
still
have
trout
as
well
as
salmon.i
should
--
i
should
not
have
said
only
salmon.
they
both
present
something
of
the
same
problem
in
--
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
now,
of
those
that
they
--
some
proportions
would
go
up
the
imnaha
and
as
i
understand
the
plans
have
been
devised
to
get
around
these
dams
so
that
they
might
go
up
to
imnaha.
there
are
also
plans
for
fish
ladders
in
connection
with
high
mountain
sheep.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
no
one
really
knows
how
successful
the
procedures
for
overcoming
a
dam
of
this
size
or
--
and
that
was
the
reason
why
the
secretary
for
some
time
urged
delaying
construction
so
as
to
solve
the
fish
problem
first
and
build
the
dam
afterwards.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
i
take
it
that
is
--
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
secretary's
present
position
is
that
there
will
be
a
real
need
for
power
in
this
area
which
requires
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
which
does
require
building
the
dam
now
or
beginning
of
the
dam
now.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
this
site,
at
this
site.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh
that
was,
that
is
what
most
of
the
record
before
the
commission
was
devoted
to.
i
perhaps
neglected
to
say
my
statement
of
facts
that
the
washington
public
power
system
amended
its
application
ultimately
to
apply
for
the
same
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
now
at
least
no
one
disputes
the
location
of
the
dam.
though
that
was
the
subject
of
dispute
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
secretary
didn't
--
never
put
an
evidence
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
--
i
suppose
it
is
a
theoretical
matter
that
the
secretary
is
free
to
change
his
mind.
we
are
now
advised,
however,
of
the
position
of
department
of
the
interior
is
that
a
dam
quite
comparable
to
that
licensed
by
the
power
commission
should
be
constructed
without
undue
delay
at
this
site.
its
purpose
would
not
only
be
to
generate
electricity,
it
would
also
to
be
serving
importance
functions
of
flood
control,
reregulating
for
the
dams
downstream,
navigation,
recreation
and
other
potential
uses.
now,
as
i
say,
our
position
is
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
not
done
its
job
here
with
respect
to
assessing
the
alternative
of
federal
development.
now,
it's
even
fair
to
say
that
that
default
on
behalf
of
the
--
on
which
we
charge
the
commission
is
not
--
it's
alone.
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
department
of
the
interior
was
not
--
did
not
give
the
commission
all
the
help
it
might
have
in
this
proceeding.
the
secretary
was
very
late
in
asserting
the
public
interest
in
the
dam
constructed
by
the
federal
government
for
all
that
has
been
by
private
power.
but
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
commission
itself
in
its
brief
in
this
court
recognizes
and
i
quote
from
its
brief
“in
a
matter
as
important
as
the
present
one
where
the
commission
had
an
independent
statutory
responsibility
to
ensure
comprehensive
development
in
utilization
of
the
nation's
waterways
are
the
fault
of
the
secretary
cannot
absolve
the
commission
from
the
exercise
of
its
duties.
in
other
words,
the
secretary's
partial
default
here
makes
the
commission's
failure
to
assess
federal
development
more
understandable
but
it
does
not
excuse
that
default.
for
that
reason,
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
below
which
dismissed
the
secretary's
claim
in
four
sentences
solely
on
the
ground
that
he
was
tardy
and
vague
in
his
submissions
to
the
commission
cannot
stand.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
not
insisting,
we
are
not
trying
to
bring
the
commission
to
book
here
simply
to
vindicate
the
principle
of
the
administrative
regularity.
that
isn't
an
unimportant
goal
but
there's
more
at
stake
here.
it
seems
to
that
here
of
all
times
the
failure
to
look
searchingly
at
the
alternative
of
federal
development
is
not
harmless
error.
in
another
case,
that
we
were
dealing
with
a
small
run
of
the
river
dam,
on
the
stretch
of
the
river
that
had
no
other
potential,
we
might
overlook
the
failure
of
the
commission
to
look
more
carefully
at
the
possible
advantages
of
federal
development.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
as
i
have
said,
this
is
a
very
major
project
which
has
many
purposes
other
than
creating
power.
and
therefore,
it
is
of
great
importance
that
this
alternative
be
explored.
and
that
is
especially
so
because
these
other
purposes,
flood
control,
navigation,
irrigation,
recreation,
fish
problems,
insofar
as
a
private
company
must
deal
with
them.
it
does
so
against
interest.
these
are
traditionally
governmental
functions
and
it
therefore
seems
on
the
face
of
it
appropriate
that
it'd
be
the
united
states
itself
which
discharge
these
functions
which
operate
this
project
is
also
relevant
that
this
project
will
dominate
these
staircase
of
federal
dams
below
and
it
--
on
the
phase
of
it
again
it
seems
appropriate
that
the
controlling
dam
at
the
head
of
this
cascade
of
federal
dams
be
likewise
controlled
by
the
same
operator,
that
is
by
the
federal
government
itself.
now,
the
federal
power
commission
didn't
see
the
case
that
way.
the
examiner
for
instance
refers
to
the
issue
of
federal
development
as
an
additional
issue
raise
by
the
secretary
when
he
ultimately
wrote
a
letter
up
suggesting
that
alternative
when
the
matter
was
before
the
examiner.
the
clear
implication
is
that
if
the
secretary
had
remained
wholly
silent
it
ever
would
have
occurred
to
the
examiner
that
there
was
an
alternative
of
federal
development.
and
here,
i
think
we
touched
the
real
problem,
our
real
quarrel
with
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case.
it's
a
matter
of
approach.
the
commission's
position
seems
to
be
that
its
job,
the
mission
for
which
the
congress
created
it
was
to
grant
licenses.
as
the
commission
now
puts
it,
whether
that's
a
wise
policy
or
an
unwise
policy
is
not
for
them
to
determine.
they
say
that
of
course
they
must
be
satisfied
that
the
applicant
presents
a
sound
plan
that
when
the
project
has
other
purposes
other
than
creating
energy,
they
may
and
must
in
the
license
imposed
conditions
that
will
or
less
assure
that
flood
control
and
navigation
and
other
matters
are
properly
handled
by
the
licensee.
but
that
whenever
an
applicant
presents
himself
who
is
qualified
and
who
is
willing
to
accept
the
conditions
which
the
commission
feels
it
necessary
to
impose
then
he
must
be
granted
a
license.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
it
seems
to
me
it
comes
to
the
same
thing.
section
10
(a)
says
that
an
applicant
shall
not
receive
a
license
unless
his
plan
is
that
best
adapted
to
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
best
adapted.
that
seems
to
mean
best
adapted
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
location
of
the
dam,
the
willingness
to
undertake
the
multipurpose
functions
which
the
stretch
of
the
river
lends
itself
to.
it
apparently
in
the
commission's
mind
has
nothing
to
do
with
who
operates
the
dam.
and
when
we
reach
that
result
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
i
--
i
think
my
point
is
illustrated
best
by
the
consistent
practice
of
the
commission.
and
so
far
as
we're
able
to
discover
the
commission
has
only
once
in
all
of
50
years
recommended
federal
development.
and
that
was
in
a
very
unusual
situation
involving
an
international
waterway,
the
saint
lawrence
seaway
where
they
did
recommend
federal
development
and
then
the
congress
have
no
action
for
three
to
four
years
and
ultimately
the
commission
even
licensed
that
project
to
a
nonfederal
applicant.
the
commission's
position
does
seem
to
be
that
when
this
qualified
applicant
presents
himself
and
they
must
grant
the
license.
the
decisions
about
federal
construction,
federal
development
of
a
waterway
are
not
for
the
commission,
they're
for
congress
acting
sua
sponte
or
at
the
instance
of
the
corps
of
engineers
or
secretary
of
the
interior.
and
they
add
that
if
congress
is
anxious
to
preserve
a
certain
waterway
for
federal
development,
it
can
always
preempt
the
site
or
simply
withdraw
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
that
waterway
as
congress
has
done
on
rare
occasions
as
in
the
columbia
or
as
in
the
colorado
river
system.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
at
odds
with
the
text
of
the
federal
power
act.
section7
(b)
in
our
view
expressly
puts
the
initial
responsibility
on
the
commission
by
deciding
whether
or
not
the
federal
development
is
appropriate
in
the
circumstances.
it's
reproduced
on
page
3
of
our
brief
and
it
reads
as
follows,
“whenever
in
the
judgment
of
the
commission
that
development
of
any
water
resources
for
public
purposes
should
be
undertaken
by
the
united
states
itself,
the
commission
shall
not
approve
any
application
for
any
project
affecting
such
development
but
shall
cause
to
be
made
examinations,
surveys,
reports,
plans
and
estimates
for
the
cause
of
the
proposed
development
as
it
may
find
necessary
and
shall
submit
its
findings
to
congress
with
such
recommendations
as
it
may
find
appropriate
concerning
such
development.”
now,
it's
true
that
this
text
doesn't
tell
the
commission
how
it
has
to
go
about
deciding
where
the
federal
development
is
preferable.
but
it
does
very
clearly
tell
the
commission
that
it
must
consider
this
alternative.
at
least
it
must
consider
this
alternative
in
some
cases.
and
the
implication
very
clearly
is
that
there
are
some
cases
where
a
federal
development
ought
to
be
recommended.
presumably
those
are
the
cases
where
the
project
says
many
functions
typically
governmental
all
aware
here
also
the
project
dominates
a
series
of
already
constructed
federal
dams.
now,
as
i
say
the
initial
responsibility
under
section
7
is
with
the
commission
to
suggest
federal
development.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
commission
doesn't
take
direct
issue
with
this
mr.
justice
black,
on
this.
they
seem
to
say
that
whenever
the
applicant
is
ready
and
willing
with
appropriate
plan,
they
must
grant
him
a
license
and
that
the
presumption
of
the
federal
power
act
is
that
a
private
applicant
can
do
the
job
as
well
as
federal
government
and
that
therefore
that
question
of
whether
the
government
in
the
circumstances
is
more
desirable
operator
of
the
very
same
project
is
not
one
which
it
can
look
behind.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
in
effect
say
that
they
do
that
job
automatically
under
section
10
(a)
and
as
a
result
in
our
view
reads
7
(b)
entirely
out
of
the
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
in
determining
whether
the
plan
is
vested
at
it
so
as
to
meet
the
criteria
of
section
10
(a),
they
have
necessarily
at
the
same
time
fulfill
their
function
under
7
(b)
because
no
plan
can
be
vested
at
it
unless
it
is
be
best
planned
and
therefore
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
now,
what
they're
really
saying
it
seems
to
me
is
that
you
look
at
the
plan
and
not
to
the
operator.
and
if
the
government
has
no
better
plan
as
we
have
no
better
plan
here
then
the
philosophy
of
the
power
act
being
to
encourage
private
development
they
must
issue
a
license
rather
than
wonder
or
investigate
and
determine
whether
the
same
project
might
not
better
be
operated
by
the
federal
government
in
the
particular
circumstances
because
it
dominates
other
federal
dams,
because
it
involves
antagonistic
functions,
flood
control,
and
production
of
energy
are
contradictory
in
many
circumstances
providing
water
for
navigation
maybe
contradictory
to
developing
the
best
energy,
providing
a
constant
flow
of
water
downstream
for
the
other
dams
maybe
at
the
sacrifice
of
developing
energy
at
the
site
by
the
company.
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
such
provision,
mr.
justice
black.
on
the
contrary,
the
existence
of
section
7
(b)
which
under
the
commission's
theory
would
be
wholly
superfluous
suggest
that
in
every
case
the
commission
must
first
determine
whether
the
nature
of
the
project
does
not
suggest
the
preferability
of
federal
development
here.
and
only
when
that
question
has
been
resolved
adversely
to
the
federal
government,
all
the
three
to
arbitrators
between
competing
applicants
for
a
license.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
section
7
(b)
is
the
section
on
which
we
rely.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
section
7
(b)
only.
now,
it
goes
without
saying
that
if
section
7
(b)
meant
nothing
more
than
that
the
best
plan
should
prevail,
it
would
be
unnecessary.
there
isn't
no
private
applicant
who's
willing
to
undertake
the
job
or
who
is
willing
to
submit
a
proper
plan
then
of
course
the
alternative
is
either
no
development
or
federal
development,
that
isn't
the
function
of
sec
--
section
7
(b).
section
7
(b)
says
where
the
commission
views
federal
development
as
the
preferable
solution,
it
shall
grant
no
license
presumably
it
means
it
shall
not
grant
a
license
which
otherwise
under
section
10
(a)
it
might
find
appropriate
to
grant.
now,
there's
much
said
in
the
briefs
about
the
evidence
in
this
record
which
shows
the
commission
now
claims
shows
that
the
question
of
federal
development
was
fully
explored.
that
is
at
odds
with
the
commission's
opinion
in
this
case
which
rather
clearly
indicated
in
its
very
terms
that
it
was
deciding
the
question
of
federal
development
because
of
the
absence
of
any
evidence
that
federal
development
would
be
better.
indeed
it
said
expressly
there
is
no
evidence
upon
which
we
can
determine
the
scope
or
seriousness
of
the
secretary's
claim
that
federal
development
is
preferred.
the
evidence
to
which
they
refer
is
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
applicant
would
undertake
some
of
these
non-power
functions.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
relative
ability
of
the
private
applicant
as
compared
to
the
federal
government
to
perform
these
functions.
it
is
in
no
sense
comparative
evidence.
it
does
not
go
to
the
question
whether
in
causing
conditions
is
a
satisfactory
alternative
to
having
the
government
itself
perform
these
functions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
white
i
think
you
--
you
put
your
finger
on
the
true
basis
of
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case.
in
fact
parts
of
the
opinion
that's
stated
basis
as
the
commission
put
it.
we
needn't
investigate
the
question
whether
federal
development
would
be
preferable
because
those
are
not
the
true
alternatives.
the
secretary
is
unwilling
to
recommend
any
development
and
we
on
the
other
hand
think
the
need
is
immediate
and
therefore
we
had
no
choice
but
to
license
it
to
the
private
applicant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission's
duty
does
not
depend
on
the
secretary's
representations.
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
that
the
commission
of
the
secretary
not
the
congress
but
the
commission
in
the
first
instance
shall
decide
for
itself
what
to
recommend.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
otherwise
they
would
never
be
of
--
let
--
let
me
say
two
things.
first,
as
it
turns
out,
the
commission
was
quite
right
in
its
estimate
of
the
very
immediate
need
for
additional
power
in
this
area.
secretary
now
agrees
that
this
project
ought
to
be
constructed
without
delay.
(voice
overlap)
it
is
not
the
position
he
took
before
the
commission
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
true
mr.
justice
white.
now,
to
put
it
the
other
way
if
the
iffiness
of
congressional
authorization
and
after
all
the
congressional
authorization
is
never
assured
were
a
justification
for
failing
to
recommend
further
development.
they
mean
every
case
the
commission
would
say,
“well,
the
alternative
of
federal
development
is
a
very
unsure
iffy
proposition
here
we
have
an
applicant,
we'll
take
a
bird
in
the
hand,”
and
that
does
in
fact
seemed
to
have
been
the
philosophy
of
the
commission
for
the
most
part
for
all
of
its
50
years.
the
net
result
is
that
federal
development
has
never
been
recommended
say
for
this
one
instance
which
i
have
mentioned.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
was
a
preliminary
permit
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
to
this
respondent.
now
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
subject
to
the
next
case
is
whether
the
preliminary
permits
survive,
so
as
to
give
the
priority
to
the
private
applicant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
as
between
--
as
between
only
private
applicants
and
public
utilities,
i
mean,
no,
municipalities
(voice
overlap)
districts,
the
preference
is
in
favor
of
the
public
group.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
there
was
none,
mr.
justice
douglas.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
other
interested
applicant
for
this
site
to
the
mount
of
pleasant
valley
on
which
the
permit,
for
which
the
permit
was
issued.
now,
the
--
still
in
the
sense
on
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
commission
tells
us
that
experience
shows
that
congress
will
not
authorize
the
expenditure
of
federal
funds
on
a
project
when
there
is
a
ready
and
willing
applicant
from
which
it
follows
that
to
recommend
federal
development
is
useless
gesture
and
therefore
we
will
grant
the
license
and
that
is
the
--
the
approach
of
the
commission
seems
to
have
taken
here
and
--
and
for
that
matter
imposed.
but
that
assumption
has
never
really
been
tested.
of
course,
the
congress
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
expected
to
give
great
weight
deference
to
the
commission's
expert
determination.
it
is
an
independent
body
removed
from
politics
as
an
extended
piece
with
an
expert
steps.
if
it
determines
that
a
license
ought
to
be
granted,
the
congress
will
normally
acquiesce.
but
so
also
the
congress
might
give
great
weight
and
might
acquiesce
if
the
commission
itself
wants
to
determine
to
recommend
federal
development.
neither
having
done
so,
it
is
unfair
to
say
that
the
congress
is
always
unwilling
to
authorize
the
expenditure
of
federal
fund
when
there's
a
private
applicant
who
is
willing
to
take
up
the
project.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
disposal
of
the
nation's
water
resources
ought
not
to
be
cheated
of
the
commission's
truly
valuable
role
as
an
expert
body
which
is
in
the
best
position
to
determine
at
the
outset
whether
federal
development
should
or
should
not
be
undertaken
considering
the
peculiarities
of
the
particular
site.
and
all
that
we
ask
here
is
that
the
commission
make
an
informed
judgment
on
that
question
on
the
basis
of
that
as
it
did
not
here
and
to
some
extent
as
it
could
not
since
the
secretary
introduced
no
evidence
and
its
staff
introduced
no
evidence
on
the
comparative
merits
of
federal
versus
nonfederal
development.
therefore,
we
submit
the
decision
below
ought
to
be
reversed
and
if
the
court
below
ought
to
be
instructed
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
for
a
reopened
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
alternative
of
federal
development.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
the
only
question
to
be
decided
on
the
secretary's
--
in
the
secretary's
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
we
take
no
--
we
take
no
position
on
the
other
question
which
of
course
would
be
mooted
if
we
should
prevail
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
commission
has
and
it
now
admits
that
it
has
a
quite
independent
responsibility.
it
has
a
staff,
it
can
investigate
on
its
own
question
of
the
federal
development
and
mind
you
it
has
a
great
deal
of
help
in
the
studies
already
made
by
the
corps
of
engineers
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
all
which
were
available
to
everyone
in
this
proceeding
that
are
quite
independent
of
anything
in
the
record.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
it
--
our
--
our
basic
position
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
the
public
interest
when
it
is
these
dimensions
cannot
be
prejudiced
to
fortitude
because
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
failed
to
be
as
helpful
or
as
timely
in
his
submissions
as
he
might
have
been.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
been
much
challenge
to
us
to
explain
what
sort
of
evidence
the
secretary
would
introduce
on
a
remand
and
whether
there
is
any
purpose
to
be
said
by
reopening
the
proceeding
in
the
commission.
it's
of
course
not
my
place
here
to
suggest
specifically
the
evidence
that
would
be
gathered
for
presentation
before
the
commission.
but
just
to
illustrate
the
kind
of
difference
between
the
kind
of
evidence
in
the
case
and
the
kind
of
evidence
that
should
be
in
the
case
and
it
would
be
in
the
case
on
a
remand,
let
me
take
the
one
question
of
flood
control.
the
corps
of
engineers
had
recommended
federal
construction
of
this
project.
it
was
some
years
prior
to
the
licensing
here.
when
faced
with
the
issuance
of
a
license
it
was
asked
what
conditions
it
would
suggest,
what
construction
it
would
suggest
for
this
project.
well,
as
to
the
physical
construction
of
the
project
the
chief
of
engineers
agreed
that
the
plan
submitted
by
the
applicant
was
adequate.
as
to
the
operation
of
the
project
for
flood
control
purposes,
he
was
asked
to
submit
and
did
submit
specific
conditions
which
should
be
incorporated
in
the
license.
that
was
the
best
that
can
be
done
if
you
have
a
license
that's
going
to
run
50
years,
you
have
to
provide
certain
more
or
less
inflexible
conditions
in
the
license
hoping
that
it
will
take
care
of
the
circumstances.
that
of
course
is
not
equivalent
to
being
able
to
call
on
a
broader
federal
operative
to
make
the
necessary
releases
or
necessary
reserves
on
any
basis
at
any
time
depending
on
the
needs
of
the
downstream
river.
what
he
was
not
asked
was
whether
there
was
any
difference
between
his
relationship
with
the
licensee
who
had
certain,
specific
and
limited
obligations
and
his
relationship
with
the
federal
dam
under
upstream
who
would
be
more
responsive
to
his
request
for
releases
or
withholding
of
water
from
flood
control
of
the
navigation
purposes.
it's
precisely
that
sort
of
comparative
evidence
that
it's
altogether
lacking
in
this
record.
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
--
i'm
not
mr.
justice
brennan
suggesting
a
particular
criteria.
i
think
it
is
obvious
that
the
commission
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
a
self-evident
that
in
determining
whether
to
recommend
federal
development
the
commission
must
first
look
to
whether
this
is
primarily
a
power
project
or
a
multipurpose
project,
whether
it
produces
power
only
for
itself
or
whether
it
controls
the
production
of
power
downstream,
whether
the
downstream
dams
are
federally
owned
or
nonfederally
owned.
how
important
relatively
these
non-power
functions
of
the
dam
are
as
compared
to
the
--
the
only
interest
of
the
private
operator
which
is
production
of
power.
i
think
these
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
suggesting
that
the
evidence
would
show
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
would
be
to
some
extent
expert
testimony.
it
would
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
commission
here
took
the
view
that
it
didn't
have
any
basis
for
making
any
such
conclusion
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
effect
that
it
was
harder
to
deal
with
a
private
power
owner
upstream.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
--
this
coordination
agreement
as
i
think
the
chief
justice
emphasized
deals
only
with
power.
it's
a
coordination
of
the
power
potential
of
the
dams
in
the
area.
it
is
limited
as
it
must
be
because
it's
a
contractual
arrangement.
first,
it
applies
only
to
the
members
and
no
one
is
forced
to
join
it.
some
have
refused
to
join
it
as
the
idaho
power
company
which
owns
these
three
upstream
dams
which
is
shown
because
it
must
be
paid
for
the
releases
which
it
made
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
that
is
true
also.
the
coordination
agreement
is
not
as
flexible
even
with
respect
to
power
coordination
as
would
be
the
operation
of
a
single
owner.
it
does
not
provide
for
hourly
exchanges
of
power,
hourly
releases.
it
must
and
we
don't
criticize
it
for
as
much
it's
the
best
that
can
be
done
as
--
as
mr.
luce
testified.
under
the
circumstances
of
a
system
which
has
a
group
of
despaired
owners,
that
is
not
to
say
and
of
course
mr.
luce
had
in
occasion
to
discuss
whether
it
would
be
preferable
to
have
a
coordinated
federal
system
even
from
the
power
plant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
say
did
the
--
the
act
is
almost
50
years
old,
to
say
50
years
experience
under
7
(b)
is
perhaps
an
exaggeration
and
there'd
been
no
recommendations
under
it
but
one
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
this
one
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
saint
lawrence
seaway
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
it
should
--
only
claim
made
in
chapman
by
the
secretary
as
i
read
it
was
that
the
approval
of
a
comprehensive
plan
for
that
particular
river
basin,
i
think
it
was
the
roanoke.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
carried
with
it
a
preemption
of
any
project
in
that
area
for
federal
development.
the
same
claim
was
advanced
in
this
case
in
that
the
original
plan
included
not
only
these
nine
downstream
dams
but
always
envisage
a
high
regulating
dam
at
the
top
of
this
cascade
and
the
argument
was
made,
we
do
not
urge
it
here
that
in
the
light
of
chapman
that
therefore
this
project
must
also
be
likened
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
they
emphasize
and
i
think
just
as
mr.
smith
pointed
out,
the
unusual
nature
of
this
dam
which
was
on
an
international
boundary
and
they
thought
it
was
to
ask
congress
whether
it
didn't
think
under
those
special
circumstances
federal
or
national
control
was
more
appropriate.
but
even
then
when
congress
failed
to
act
for
three
or
four
years
thereafter,
it
was
licensed
or
be
it
in
the
state
of
new
york
not
to
a
private
power
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
if
that
at
least
and
now
we
really
urged,
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
and
i
think
that
the
chapman
case
itself
makes
this
clear
that
in
every
case,
the
commission's
first
duty
which
it
cannot
defer
to
congress
or
to
the
secretary
about
is
to
determine
for
itself
whether
federal
development
is
appropriate
even
though
there
is
an
applicant
who
is
willing
in
terms
of
what
he
says
in
his
application
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
weighing
is
as
i've
suggested
the
--
the
peculiarities
of
the
project
in
question,
the
fact
that
it's
not
a
mere
run
of
the
river
project
solely
destined
to
create
power
for
itself
but
has
this
important
governmental
functions
to
perform
does
affect
the
system
of
federal
dams
downstream.
these
are
merely
--
some
of
the
elements
that
must
go
into
that
determination.
now,
the
act
does
not
tell
the
commission
how
to
go
about
it.
all
we
insist
is
that
it
do
seriously
consider
that
question
and
that
it
do
so
on
evidence.
here,
whatever
is
said
today
in
court,
the
commission
and
the
examiner
treated
this
as
a
new
issue
introduced
by
the
secretary
after
the
evidence
is
--
was
closed,
as
to
which
there
was
no
evidence.
and
the
court
of
appeal
affirmed
simply
on
the
ground
that
the
secretary
in
default
and
therefore
had
no
business
in
planning.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
me,
is
his
statement
at
that
particular
point
is
unexceptionable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
though
chapman
makes
it
clear
that
first
you
determine
whether
federal
department
is
appropriate
then
if
you
decide
against
federal
development.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
you
compare
the
advantages.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
the
--
the
approach
of
the
act,
that
if
the
private
applicant
can
do
it
as
well
as
the
government.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
if
they're
not
supported
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they're
not
supported
by
any
evidence.
the
mere
conclusions
since
the
examinee
himself
says
this
is
a
new
issue
the
secretary
introduce
--
introduced
after
the
evidence
was
closed.
the
only
reason
i
am
considering
it
is
because
the
commission
has
told
me
to
reopen
the
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
his
letter
not
any
testimony
therefore,
i'm
going
through
this
recital
of
the
possible
arguments
made
by
the
secretary
in
this
letter
which
i've
been
required
to
consider
and
i'm
rejecting
them
one
at
a
time.
i
--
but
he
--
i
think
he
had
no
evidence
on
which
to
do
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
that
i
must
say
that
i
am
--
i
am
advised
that
they're
all
strong
showings
that
could
be
made
on
the
remand
as
to
what
the
federal
government
in
specific
areas
could
do
better
job.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
respect
to
coordination
of
power
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
respect
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
the
one
aspect
is
the
--
the
rela
--
the
coordination
between
these
various
functions.how
do
you
weigh
whether
the
fish
are
more
important
or
the
flood
control
advantage
is
more
important
than
navigation
or
power?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
but
it
hasn't
done
the
job.
we
don't
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
can
only
accept
your
honors
words,
purports.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
white
the
commission
itself
says
in
so
many
words.
in
summary
the
delay
inherent
in
federal
construction
would
foreclose
power
coming
on
the
line
at
the
time
when
it
would
be
required.
this
disadvantage
outweighs
those
benefits
which
the
interior
contends
with
result
to
federal
construction
assuming
arguendo
that
such
benefits
would
be
realized
conceding
really
that
it
was
in
no
position
on
this
record
as
it
says
explicitly
earlier
on
to
assess
the
secretary's
claim
but
saying
in
any
event
he's
not
willing
to
build
it,
so
we
can't
seriously
look
to
that
alternative.
and
it's
the
failure
to
look
seriously
to
that
--
to
that
alternative
seems
to
us
to
be
the
--
the
error
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
trial
examiner
also
says
that
there
is
no
evidence
upon
which
he
can
find,
that
federal
development
is
superior,
that
it's
always
put
into
negative
and
has
to
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
it
--
it
was
an
expressed
concern
by
those
who
favored
governmental
power
to
make
sure
that
they
would
remain
an
area
for
federal
development
and
as
one
of
the
chairman
of
one
of
the
committees
put
it,
the
government
would
retain
first
right
on
its
waterways,
first
right
over
any
public
utility
of
private
power
applicant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subject
matter
of
this
case
and
the
next
one
is
the
construction
of
a
high
dam
on
the
snake
river
between
--
which
forms
the
boundary
between
idaho
and
oregon.
the
snake
river
is
a
major
tributary
of
the
columbia
as
the
--
the
small
maps
which
have
been
distributed
to
the
court
and
blow
up
to
which
will
appear
shortly
will
indicate
the
snake
river
flows
north
of
way
and
then
west
merges
with
the
columbia
which
in
turn
moves
west
and
flows
into
the
pacific
ocean,
just
beyond
portland.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
separately
justice
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
--
they're
now
being
distributed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
to
illustrate
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
douglas,
just
the
first.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
463
which
is
--
the
order
was
reversed
by
order
of
the
court.
the
order
of
the
cases,
this
is
udall
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
versus
federal
power
commission.
the
snake
river
is
represented
on
the
small
map
here.
at
this
point,
it
merges
into
the
columbia
river
which
in
turn
as
to
say
goes
west
and
empties
into
the
pacific
ocean.
we
are
concerned
with
the
70-mile
stretch
of
that
river
approximately
between
the
boundary
of
washington
and
oregon
point
approximately
here
down
to
the
site
of
hells
canyon
dam
which
has
been
licensed
to
the
idaho
power
company,
as
well
as
oxbow
and
brownlee
dam
which
are
owned
and
controlled
by
that
same
company.
the
70-mile
stretch
of
the
snake
river
is
an
ideal
site
for
hydroelectric
dam.
it's
a
deep
gorges
sort
of
canyon
with
the
bottoms
on
both
sides
ready-made
for
the
installation
of
a
high
dam.
yet,
the
700-mile
stretch
will
support
only
one
such
high
dam.
it
is
moreover
the
less
important
site
on
the
snake
columbia
river
for
the
construction
of
this
sort
of
high
regulating
dam.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
petition
on
the
merits
on
behalf
of
the
secretary,
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
number
463.
i
should
point
out
two
other
facts
about
this
area.
one
is
the
confluence
of
the
salmon
river
with
snake.
the
salmon
river
as
its
name
indicates
is
one
of
the
important
fish
resources
of
the
united
states
of
this
area.
also,
the
imnaha
river
to
a
less
extent
is
an
important
to
salmon
sanctuary,
fish-breeding
ground.
in
this
stretch
of
the
river,
there
were
considered
three
possible
sites
for
the
location
of
the
dam.
we're
not
disputing
the
commission's
finding
as
to
the
ultimate
location
but
you
will
hear
much
about
the
three
sites
and
i
might
as
well
locate
them
for
you
now.
the
first
site
for
the
high
dam
was
called
pleasant
valley
and
was
considerably
upstream
from
the
mountain
sheep
site
which
is
shown
on
this
map.
it
was
accompanied
as
all
of
these
high
dams
are
by
a
small
low-regulating
dam
below
it
which
was
the
nominated
low
mountain
sheep.
that's
at
one
extreme,
but
the
other
extreme
was
a
dam
below
downstream
from
the
present
site
called
nez
perce
which
was
to
be
operated
in
conjunction
with
china
gardens,
a
small
dam
below
it
which
is
shown
on
the
map.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice
something
approximating
27
miles.
the
pleasant
valley
site
being
upstream
had
the
least
capability
for
generating
power
because
it
caught
less
water
than
--
than
the
dam
further
downstream.
on
the
other
hand,
it
had
the
advantage
of
being
upstream
from
the
confluents
of
the
salmon
and
imnaha
rivers
and
therefore
would
not
interfere
with
the
fish
runs
up
those
rivers.
the
federal
power
commission
determined
not
to
license
that
site
because
it
did
not
use
the
best
advantage,
the
four
capabilities
of
the
river.
it
indicated
in
its
best
opinion
that
the
ideal
site
was
nez
perce
downstream
at
the
other
extreme.
the
difficulty
with
nez
perce
was
that
while
they
caught
both
the
waters
of
the
salmon
and
of
the
snake,
and
was
therefore
ideal
from
the
point
of
view
of
generating
power,
he
did
interfere
with
the
fish
going
up
to
salmon
and
the
imnaha
river
particularly
at
the
salmon
river.
and
ultimately
for
that
reason,
since
they
had
not
yet
and
still
has
not
been
developed
any
sure
way
of
getting
the
salmon
over
such
a
high
dam,
that
site
was
abandoned.
and
ultimately
the
commission
settled
on
a
compromise
which
is
high
mountain
sheep,
the
dam
shown
here.
and
as
i
say,
no
one
disputes
the
commission's
judgment
in
finding
this
site
more
points
of
view
than
those
preferable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
between
the
salmon
and
the
imnaha,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
salmon
is
by
far
the
most
important
of
fish
breeding
ground.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
there
has
been
devised
or
hopefully
it
will
be
devised
a
way
of
allowing
the
salmon
to
come
up
the
imnaha
by
a
canal
around
the
dam.
but
it
does
--
it
is
upstream
from
the
salmon
and
therefore
it
preserves
that
river
free
of
any
obstruction.
now
this
dam,
the
high
mountain
sheep
dam,
which
has
now
been
licensed
to
the
pacific
northwest
company
by
the
federal
power
commission,
is
a
very
large
dam.
it's
approximately
--
it
will
be
approximately
700
feet
high.
it
will
have
a
reservoir
pool
behind
at
some
760-mile
long.
it
will
hold
--
that
pool
will
hold
some
2-million
acre
feet
of
usable
storage.
it
will
be
a
project
second
to
none
in
the
columbia
river
basin
with
a
single
exception
of
grand
coulee
dam.
because
of
its
size
and
its
location,
this
dam
across
has
a
capability
of
producing
a
very
important
amount
of
power
but
it
also
has
other
very
important
potentials.
it
has
potential
for
flood
control
by
releasing
or
holding
back
the
very
seasonal
waters
of
the
snake
river.
it
has
a
potential
perfecting
navigation
one
way
or
the
other.
it
also
has
possibilities
in
the
area
of
water
quality
control,
irrigation
and
finally
recreation.
there's
one
other
fact
which
to
us
is
the
most
important
which
is
that
by
its
location
and
because
of
its
size,
it
will
dominate
all
the
dams
downstream
on
the
snake
and
the
columbia
river.
that
is
shown
more
graphically
on
this
pert
chart.
here
is
high
mountain
sheep
in
red
and
here
are
nine
dams
below
it,
all
of
which
depend
on
the
flow
of
the
river
and
their
availability
of
water
will
depend
on
the
releases
which
this
high
dam
makes.
now,
as
it
happens,
those
nine
dams
below
the
site
which
has
now
been
licensed
to
this
private
power
company,
all
federal
dams
owned
and
operated
by
the
united
states
through
the
corps
of
engineers
in
collaboration
with
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
china
gardens
has
not
been
licensed
nor
has
it
been
constructed
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
authorized
for
federal
construction
when
the
examiner
in
this
case
indicated
that
high
mountain
sheep
would
be
recommended
for
private
development,
the
congress
deauthorized
china
gardens
assuming
that
each
should
go
in
tandem
with
high
mountain
sheep.
china
gardens,
however,
is
not
at
issue
before
the
court.
perhaps
the
assumption
is
that
it
will
go
as
high
mountain
sheep
levels.
i
have
also
distributed
to
the
members
of
the
court
this
morning
through
the
clerk
the
--
an
abbreviated
chronology
of
the
events
in
this
case,
hopefully
to
spare
the
court
the
need
to
hear
a
full
recitation
of
the
rather
involved
proceedings
that
have
taken
place
in
this
case.
basically,
there
were
two
--
well
three
proceedings.
the
first
was
a
proceeding
by
the
present
licensee
the
pacific
northwest
to
obtain
the
license
for
the
first
site
i
spoke
of,
pleasant
valley.
that
was
in
1954,
they
got
a
preliminary
permit,
they
applied
for
a
license,
that
license
--
preliminary
permit
was
granted,
the
license
was
denied
ultimately
by
the
commission
and
it
was
denied
largely
on
the
ground
that
this
was
too
far
upstream
and
did
not
fully
utilized
the
resources
of
the
stretch
of
the
river.
the
commission
at
that
time
indicating
that
it
would
license
a
project
which
included
nez
perce
much
farther
downstream
but
not
this
pleasant
valley
site
which
did
not
utilize
the
river
to
its
fullest.
accordingly,
a
new
application
was
made
by
pacific
northwest
but
not
for
the
nez
perce,
for
this
intermediate
site
of
high
mountain
sheep.
sometime
later,
the
other
petitioner
here
in
the
next
case,
washington
public
power,
filed
its
own
application
for
nez
perce.
at
its
request,
the
commission
consolidated
these
two
proceedings
and
held
a
comparative
hearing
on
the
two
applicants
and
the
two
sites.
the
secretary
of
interior
had
been
asked
by
the
commission
to
comment
on
these
two
applications
and
he
suggested
the
deferral
of
the
whole
licensing
matter
until
the
fish
problem
could
be
resolved,
also
asserting
that
there
was
no
present
need
for
power
in
the
area
and
therefore
no
occasion
to
grant
a
license
of
this
term.
ultimately,
the
examiner
recommended
for
this
high
mountain
sheep
site,
the
secretary
at
that
point
moved
to
intervene
in
the
proceedings.
he
was
granted
leave
to
file
exemptions
to
the
examiner's
report
in
no
other
sense
was
his
intervention
active.
he
did
file
exceptions.
the
commission
ultimately
agreed
with
the
examiner
and
licensed
this
project
of
high
mountain
sheep
to
the
private
power
company
of
pacific
northwest.
at
that
point,
the
secretary
asked
the
proceedings
to
be
reopened
so
that
he
might
present
evidence
as
to
the
superiority
of
federal
development
of
this
site.
the
commission
delayed
its
opinion
granted
a
pro
forma
rehearing
which
was
simply
a
holding
back
in
its
opinion
for
a
month.
then
without
reopening
the
record,
it
did
reaffirm
its
previous
decision
making
some
changes
with
respect
to
the
conditions
to
be
imposed
in
the
license
--
on
the
licensee.
the
secretary
together
with
the
washington
public
power
system
which
had
all
of
these
applications,
both
appealed,
both
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
affirmed
the
federal
power
commission
and
in
turn
the
secretary
and
the
washington
public
power
system
on
different
grounds
petitioned
here
for
certiorari.
now,
the
issue
we
present
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
has
given
adequate
consideration
to
the
alternative
of
federal
development
of
this
site
at
high
mountain
sheep
rather
than
licensing
it
as
it
did.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
very
little,
mr.
justice
douglas.
up
--
there
are
many
considerations
which
might
suggest
in
this
particular
instance
federal
development.
we
do
not
suggest
that
this
court
decide
of
it,
even
the
court
below
decides
which
is
preferable.
we
simply
say
that
before
the
alternative
of
federal
development
is
brushed
aside,
it
must
be
seriously
considered
by
the
commission
as
a
real
alternative
and
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
on
that
point
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
evidence
of
which
there
was
none
in
this
record.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
--
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
--
the
fish
problem
is
a
serious
problem.
however,
the
present
site
which
saves
the
fish
runs
up
the
salmon
river
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
all
those
who
adhere
a
satisfactory
solution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
they
--
there
are
all
the
advantages
in
this
respect
also
it
seems
to
us
in
federal
development
because
the
department
of
the
interior
is
quite
naturally
more
concerned
in
preserving
the
fish
resource
than
with
the
private
power
applicant.
on
the
other
hand,
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
such
claim
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
must
say
that
experience
apparently
shows
that
the
salmon
have
quite
successfully
managed
to
survive
these
small
federal
dams.
it
is
apparently
established
that
fish
ladders
can
be
constructive
to
allow
the
salmon
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
navigate
over
small
dams
of
this
sort.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
there
are
problems
further
upstream
at
the
brownlee
dam
which
is
an
idaho
power
company
dam
and
they
doubt
this
would
be
problems
that
high
mountain
sheep
no
matter
who
constructed
it
but
the
salmon
run
beyond
the
salmon
river
is
a
very
much
lesser
importance
at
least
now.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
maybe
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
still
have
trout
as
well
as
salmon.i
should
--
i
should
not
have
said
only
salmon.
they
both
present
something
of
the
same
problem
in
--
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
now,
of
those
that
they
--
some
proportions
would
go
up
the
imnaha
and
as
i
understand
the
plans
have
been
devised
to
get
around
these
dams
so
that
they
might
go
up
to
imnaha.
there
are
also
plans
for
fish
ladders
in
connection
with
high
mountain
sheep.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
no
one
really
knows
how
successful
the
procedures
for
overcoming
a
dam
of
this
size
or
--
and
that
was
the
reason
why
the
secretary
for
some
time
urged
delaying
construction
so
as
to
solve
the
fish
problem
first
and
build
the
dam
afterwards.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
i
take
it
that
is
--
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
secretary's
present
position
is
that
there
will
be
a
real
need
for
power
in
this
area
which
requires
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
which
does
require
building
the
dam
now
or
beginning
of
the
dam
now.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
this
site,
at
this
site.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh
that
was,
that
is
what
most
of
the
record
before
the
commission
was
devoted
to.
i
perhaps
neglected
to
say
my
statement
of
facts
that
the
washington
public
power
system
amended
its
application
ultimately
to
apply
for
the
same
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
now
at
least
no
one
disputes
the
location
of
the
dam.
though
that
was
the
subject
of
dispute
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
secretary
didn't
--
never
put
an
evidence
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
--
i
suppose
it
is
a
theoretical
matter
that
the
secretary
is
free
to
change
his
mind.
we
are
now
advised,
however,
of
the
position
of
department
of
the
interior
is
that
a
dam
quite
comparable
to
that
licensed
by
the
power
commission
should
be
constructed
without
undue
delay
at
this
site.
its
purpose
would
not
only
be
to
generate
electricity,
it
would
also
to
be
serving
importance
functions
of
flood
control,
reregulating
for
the
dams
downstream,
navigation,
recreation
and
other
potential
uses.
now,
as
i
say,
our
position
is
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
not
done
its
job
here
with
respect
to
assessing
the
alternative
of
federal
development.
now,
it's
even
fair
to
say
that
that
default
on
behalf
of
the
--
on
which
we
charge
the
commission
is
not
--
it's
alone.
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
department
of
the
interior
was
not
--
did
not
give
the
commission
all
the
help
it
might
have
in
this
proceeding.
the
secretary
was
very
late
in
asserting
the
public
interest
in
the
dam
constructed
by
the
federal
government
for
all
that
has
been
by
private
power.
but
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
commission
itself
in
its
brief
in
this
court
recognizes
and
i
quote
from
its
brief
“in
a
matter
as
important
as
the
present
one
where
the
commission
had
an
independent
statutory
responsibility
to
ensure
comprehensive
development
in
utilization
of
the
nation's
waterways
are
the
fault
of
the
secretary
cannot
absolve
the
commission
from
the
exercise
of
its
duties.
in
other
words,
the
secretary's
partial
default
here
makes
the
commission's
failure
to
assess
federal
development
more
understandable
but
it
does
not
excuse
that
default.
for
that
reason,
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
below
which
dismissed
the
secretary's
claim
in
four
sentences
solely
on
the
ground
that
he
was
tardy
and
vague
in
his
submissions
to
the
commission
cannot
stand.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
not
insisting,
we
are
not
trying
to
bring
the
commission
to
book
here
simply
to
vindicate
the
principle
of
the
administrative
regularity.
that
isn't
an
unimportant
goal
but
there's
more
at
stake
here.
it
seems
to
that
here
of
all
times
the
failure
to
look
searchingly
at
the
alternative
of
federal
development
is
not
harmless
error.
in
another
case,
that
we
were
dealing
with
a
small
run
of
the
river
dam,
on
the
stretch
of
the
river
that
had
no
other
potential,
we
might
overlook
the
failure
of
the
commission
to
look
more
carefully
at
the
possible
advantages
of
federal
development.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
as
i
have
said,
this
is
a
very
major
project
which
has
many
purposes
other
than
creating
power.
and
therefore,
it
is
of
great
importance
that
this
alternative
be
explored.
and
that
is
especially
so
because
these
other
purposes,
flood
control,
navigation,
irrigation,
recreation,
fish
problems,
insofar
as
a
private
company
must
deal
with
them.
it
does
so
against
interest.
these
are
traditionally
governmental
functions
and
it
therefore
seems
on
the
face
of
it
appropriate
that
it'd
be
the
united
states
itself
which
discharge
these
functions
which
operate
this
project
is
also
relevant
that
this
project
will
dominate
these
staircase
of
federal
dams
below
and
it
--
on
the
phase
of
it
again
it
seems
appropriate
that
the
controlling
dam
at
the
head
of
this
cascade
of
federal
dams
be
likewise
controlled
by
the
same
operator,
that
is
by
the
federal
government
itself.
now,
the
federal
power
commission
didn't
see
the
case
that
way.
the
examiner
for
instance
refers
to
the
issue
of
federal
development
as
an
additional
issue
raise
by
the
secretary
when
he
ultimately
wrote
a
letter
up
suggesting
that
alternative
when
the
matter
was
before
the
examiner.
the
clear
implication
is
that
if
the
secretary
had
remained
wholly
silent
it
ever
would
have
occurred
to
the
examiner
that
there
was
an
alternative
of
federal
development.
and
here,
i
think
we
touched
the
real
problem,
our
real
quarrel
with
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case.
it's
a
matter
of
approach.
the
commission's
position
seems
to
be
that
its
job,
the
mission
for
which
the
congress
created
it
was
to
grant
licenses.
as
the
commission
now
puts
it,
whether
that's
a
wise
policy
or
an
unwise
policy
is
not
for
them
to
determine.
they
say
that
of
course
they
must
be
satisfied
that
the
applicant
presents
a
sound
plan
that
when
the
project
has
other
purposes
other
than
creating
energy,
they
may
and
must
in
the
license
imposed
conditions
that
will
or
less
assure
that
flood
control
and
navigation
and
other
matters
are
properly
handled
by
the
licensee.
but
that
whenever
an
applicant
presents
himself
who
is
qualified
and
who
is
willing
to
accept
the
conditions
which
the
commission
feels
it
necessary
to
impose
then
he
must
be
granted
a
license.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
it
seems
to
me
it
comes
to
the
same
thing.
section
10
(a)
says
that
an
applicant
shall
not
receive
a
license
unless
his
plan
is
that
best
adapted
to
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
best
adapted.
that
seems
to
mean
best
adapted
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
location
of
the
dam,
the
willingness
to
undertake
the
multipurpose
functions
which
the
stretch
of
the
river
lends
itself
to.
it
apparently
in
the
commission's
mind
has
nothing
to
do
with
who
operates
the
dam.
and
when
we
reach
that
result
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
i
--
i
think
my
point
is
illustrated
best
by
the
consistent
practice
of
the
commission.
and
so
far
as
we're
able
to
discover
the
commission
has
only
once
in
all
of
50
years
recommended
federal
development.
and
that
was
in
a
very
unusual
situation
involving
an
international
waterway,
the
saint
lawrence
seaway
where
they
did
recommend
federal
development
and
then
the
congress
have
no
action
for
three
to
four
years
and
ultimately
the
commission
even
licensed
that
project
to
a
nonfederal
applicant.
the
commission's
position
does
seem
to
be
that
when
this
qualified
applicant
presents
himself
and
they
must
grant
the
license.
the
decisions
about
federal
construction,
federal
development
of
a
waterway
are
not
for
the
commission,
they're
for
congress
acting
sua
sponte
or
at
the
instance
of
the
corps
of
engineers
or
secretary
of
the
interior.
and
they
add
that
if
congress
is
anxious
to
preserve
a
certain
waterway
for
federal
development,
it
can
always
preempt
the
site
or
simply
withdraw
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
that
waterway
as
congress
has
done
on
rare
occasions
as
in
the
columbia
or
as
in
the
colorado
river
system.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
at
odds
with
the
text
of
the
federal
power
act.
section7
(b)
in
our
view
expressly
puts
the
initial
responsibility
on
the
commission
by
deciding
whether
or
not
the
federal
development
is
appropriate
in
the
circumstances.
it's
reproduced
on
page
3
of
our
brief
and
it
reads
as
follows,
“whenever
in
the
judgment
of
the
commission
that
development
of
any
water
resources
for
public
purposes
should
be
undertaken
by
the
united
states
itself,
the
commission
shall
not
approve
any
application
for
any
project
affecting
such
development
but
shall
cause
to
be
made
examinations,
surveys,
reports,
plans
and
estimates
for
the
cause
of
the
proposed
development
as
it
may
find
necessary
and
shall
submit
its
findings
to
congress
with
such
recommendations
as
it
may
find
appropriate
concerning
such
development.”
now,
it's
true
that
this
text
doesn't
tell
the
commission
how
it
has
to
go
about
deciding
where
the
federal
development
is
preferable.
but
it
does
very
clearly
tell
the
commission
that
it
must
consider
this
alternative.
at
least
it
must
consider
this
alternative
in
some
cases.
and
the
implication
very
clearly
is
that
there
are
some
cases
where
a
federal
development
ought
to
be
recommended.
presumably
those
are
the
cases
where
the
project
says
many
functions
typically
governmental
all
aware
here
also
the
project
dominates
a
series
of
already
constructed
federal
dams.
now,
as
i
say
the
initial
responsibility
under
section
7
is
with
the
commission
to
suggest
federal
development.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
commission
doesn't
take
direct
issue
with
this
mr.
justice
black,
on
this.
they
seem
to
say
that
whenever
the
applicant
is
ready
and
willing
with
appropriate
plan,
they
must
grant
him
a
license
and
that
the
presumption
of
the
federal
power
act
is
that
a
private
applicant
can
do
the
job
as
well
as
federal
government
and
that
therefore
that
question
of
whether
the
government
in
the
circumstances
is
more
desirable
operator
of
the
very
same
project
is
not
one
which
it
can
look
behind.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
in
effect
say
that
they
do
that
job
automatically
under
section
10
(a)
and
as
a
result
in
our
view
reads
7
(b)
entirely
out
of
the
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
in
determining
whether
the
plan
is
vested
at
it
so
as
to
meet
the
criteria
of
section
10
(a),
they
have
necessarily
at
the
same
time
fulfill
their
function
under
7
(b)
because
no
plan
can
be
vested
at
it
unless
it
is
be
best
planned
and
therefore
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
now,
what
they're
really
saying
it
seems
to
me
is
that
you
look
at
the
plan
and
not
to
the
operator.
and
if
the
government
has
no
better
plan
as
we
have
no
better
plan
here
then
the
philosophy
of
the
power
act
being
to
encourage
private
development
they
must
issue
a
license
rather
than
wonder
or
investigate
and
determine
whether
the
same
project
might
not
better
be
operated
by
the
federal
government
in
the
particular
circumstances
because
it
dominates
other
federal
dams,
because
it
involves
antagonistic
functions,
flood
control,
and
production
of
energy
are
contradictory
in
many
circumstances
providing
water
for
navigation
maybe
contradictory
to
developing
the
best
energy,
providing
a
constant
flow
of
water
downstream
for
the
other
dams
maybe
at
the
sacrifice
of
developing
energy
at
the
site
by
the
company.
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
such
provision,
mr.
justice
black.
on
the
contrary,
the
existence
of
section
7
(b)
which
under
the
commission's
theory
would
be
wholly
superfluous
suggest
that
in
every
case
the
commission
must
first
determine
whether
the
nature
of
the
project
does
not
suggest
the
preferability
of
federal
development
here.
and
only
when
that
question
has
been
resolved
adversely
to
the
federal
government,
all
the
three
to
arbitrators
between
competing
applicants
for
a
license.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
section
7
(b)
is
the
section
on
which
we
rely.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
section
7
(b)
only.
now,
it
goes
without
saying
that
if
section
7
(b)
meant
nothing
more
than
that
the
best
plan
should
prevail,
it
would
be
unnecessary.
there
isn't
no
private
applicant
who's
willing
to
undertake
the
job
or
who
is
willing
to
submit
a
proper
plan
then
of
course
the
alternative
is
either
no
development
or
federal
development,
that
isn't
the
function
of
sec
--
section
7
(b).
section
7
(b)
says
where
the
commission
views
federal
development
as
the
preferable
solution,
it
shall
grant
no
license
presumably
it
means
it
shall
not
grant
a
license
which
otherwise
under
section
10
(a)
it
might
find
appropriate
to
grant.
now,
there's
much
said
in
the
briefs
about
the
evidence
in
this
record
which
shows
the
commission
now
claims
shows
that
the
question
of
federal
development
was
fully
explored.
that
is
at
odds
with
the
commission's
opinion
in
this
case
which
rather
clearly
indicated
in
its
very
terms
that
it
was
deciding
the
question
of
federal
development
because
of
the
absence
of
any
evidence
that
federal
development
would
be
better.
indeed
it
said
expressly
there
is
no
evidence
upon
which
we
can
determine
the
scope
or
seriousness
of
the
secretary's
claim
that
federal
development
is
preferred.
the
evidence
to
which
they
refer
is
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
applicant
would
undertake
some
of
these
non-power
functions.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
relative
ability
of
the
private
applicant
as
compared
to
the
federal
government
to
perform
these
functions.
it
is
in
no
sense
comparative
evidence.
it
does
not
go
to
the
question
whether
in
causing
conditions
is
a
satisfactory
alternative
to
having
the
government
itself
perform
these
functions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
white
i
think
you
--
you
put
your
finger
on
the
true
basis
of
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case.
in
fact
parts
of
the
opinion
that's
stated
basis
as
the
commission
put
it.
we
needn't
investigate
the
question
whether
federal
development
would
be
preferable
because
those
are
not
the
true
alternatives.
the
secretary
is
unwilling
to
recommend
any
development
and
we
on
the
other
hand
think
the
need
is
immediate
and
therefore
we
had
no
choice
but
to
license
it
to
the
private
applicant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission's
duty
does
not
depend
on
the
secretary's
representations.
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
that
the
commission
of
the
secretary
not
the
congress
but
the
commission
in
the
first
instance
shall
decide
for
itself
what
to
recommend.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
otherwise
they
would
never
be
of
--
let
--
let
me
say
two
things.
first,
as
it
turns
out,
the
commission
was
quite
right
in
its
estimate
of
the
very
immediate
need
for
additional
power
in
this
area.
secretary
now
agrees
that
this
project
ought
to
be
constructed
without
delay.
(voice
overlap)
it
is
not
the
position
he
took
before
the
commission
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
true
mr.
justice
white.
now,
to
put
it
the
other
way
if
the
iffiness
of
congressional
authorization
and
after
all
the
congressional
authorization
is
never
assured
were
a
justification
for
failing
to
recommend
further
development.
they
mean
every
case
the
commission
would
say,
“well,
the
alternative
of
federal
development
is
a
very
unsure
iffy
proposition
here
we
have
an
applicant,
we'll
take
a
bird
in
the
hand,”
and
that
does
in
fact
seemed
to
have
been
the
philosophy
of
the
commission
for
the
most
part
for
all
of
its
50
years.
the
net
result
is
that
federal
development
has
never
been
recommended
say
for
this
one
instance
which
i
have
mentioned.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
was
a
preliminary
permit
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
to
this
respondent.
now
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
subject
to
the
next
case
is
whether
the
preliminary
permits
survive,
so
as
to
give
the
priority
to
the
private
applicant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
as
between
--
as
between
only
private
applicants
and
public
utilities,
i
mean,
no,
municipalities
(voice
overlap)
districts,
the
preference
is
in
favor
of
the
public
group.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
there
was
none,
mr.
justice
douglas.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
other
interested
applicant
for
this
site
to
the
mount
of
pleasant
valley
on
which
the
permit,
for
which
the
permit
was
issued.
now,
the
--
still
in
the
sense
on
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
commission
tells
us
that
experience
shows
that
congress
will
not
authorize
the
expenditure
of
federal
funds
on
a
project
when
there
is
a
ready
and
willing
applicant
from
which
it
follows
that
to
recommend
federal
development
is
useless
gesture
and
therefore
we
will
grant
the
license
and
that
is
the
--
the
approach
of
the
commission
seems
to
have
taken
here
and
--
and
for
that
matter
imposed.
but
that
assumption
has
never
really
been
tested.
of
course,
the
congress
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
expected
to
give
great
weight
deference
to
the
commission's
expert
determination.
it
is
an
independent
body
removed
from
politics
as
an
extended
piece
with
an
expert
steps.
if
it
determines
that
a
license
ought
to
be
granted,
the
congress
will
normally
acquiesce.
but
so
also
the
congress
might
give
great
weight
and
might
acquiesce
if
the
commission
itself
wants
to
determine
to
recommend
federal
development.
neither
having
done
so,
it
is
unfair
to
say
that
the
congress
is
always
unwilling
to
authorize
the
expenditure
of
federal
fund
when
there's
a
private
applicant
who
is
willing
to
take
up
the
project.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
disposal
of
the
nation's
water
resources
ought
not
to
be
cheated
of
the
commission's
truly
valuable
role
as
an
expert
body
which
is
in
the
best
position
to
determine
at
the
outset
whether
federal
development
should
or
should
not
be
undertaken
considering
the
peculiarities
of
the
particular
site.
and
all
that
we
ask
here
is
that
the
commission
make
an
informed
judgment
on
that
question
on
the
basis
of
that
as
it
did
not
here
and
to
some
extent
as
it
could
not
since
the
secretary
introduced
no
evidence
and
its
staff
introduced
no
evidence
on
the
comparative
merits
of
federal
versus
nonfederal
development.
therefore,
we
submit
the
decision
below
ought
to
be
reversed
and
if
the
court
below
ought
to
be
instructed
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
for
a
reopened
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
alternative
of
federal
development.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
the
only
question
to
be
decided
on
the
secretary's
--
in
the
secretary's
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
we
take
no
--
we
take
no
position
on
the
other
question
which
of
course
would
be
mooted
if
we
should
prevail
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
commission
has
and
it
now
admits
that
it
has
a
quite
independent
responsibility.
it
has
a
staff,
it
can
investigate
on
its
own
question
of
the
federal
development
and
mind
you
it
has
a
great
deal
of
help
in
the
studies
already
made
by
the
corps
of
engineers
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation
all
which
were
available
to
everyone
in
this
proceeding
that
are
quite
independent
of
anything
in
the
record.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
it
--
our
--
our
basic
position
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
the
public
interest
when
it
is
these
dimensions
cannot
be
prejudiced
to
fortitude
because
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
failed
to
be
as
helpful
or
as
timely
in
his
submissions
as
he
might
have
been.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
been
much
challenge
to
us
to
explain
what
sort
of
evidence
the
secretary
would
introduce
on
a
remand
and
whether
there
is
any
purpose
to
be
said
by
reopening
the
proceeding
in
the
commission.
it's
of
course
not
my
place
here
to
suggest
specifically
the
evidence
that
would
be
gathered
for
presentation
before
the
commission.
but
just
to
illustrate
the
kind
of
difference
between
the
kind
of
evidence
in
the
case
and
the
kind
of
evidence
that
should
be
in
the
case
and
it
would
be
in
the
case
on
a
remand,
let
me
take
the
one
question
of
flood
control.
the
corps
of
engineers
had
recommended
federal
construction
of
this
project.
it
was
some
years
prior
to
the
licensing
here.
when
faced
with
the
issuance
of
a
license
it
was
asked
what
conditions
it
would
suggest,
what
construction
it
would
suggest
for
this
project.
well,
as
to
the
physical
construction
of
the
project
the
chief
of
engineers
agreed
that
the
plan
submitted
by
the
applicant
was
adequate.
as
to
the
operation
of
the
project
for
flood
control
purposes,
he
was
asked
to
submit
and
did
submit
specific
conditions
which
should
be
incorporated
in
the
license.
that
was
the
best
that
can
be
done
if
you
have
a
license
that's
going
to
run
50
years,
you
have
to
provide
certain
more
or
less
inflexible
conditions
in
the
license
hoping
that
it
will
take
care
of
the
circumstances.
that
of
course
is
not
equivalent
to
being
able
to
call
on
a
broader
federal
operative
to
make
the
necessary
releases
or
necessary
reserves
on
any
basis
at
any
time
depending
on
the
needs
of
the
downstream
river.
what
he
was
not
asked
was
whether
there
was
any
difference
between
his
relationship
with
the
licensee
who
had
certain,
specific
and
limited
obligations
and
his
relationship
with
the
federal
dam
under
upstream
who
would
be
more
responsive
to
his
request
for
releases
or
withholding
of
water
from
flood
control
of
the
navigation
purposes.
it's
precisely
that
sort
of
comparative
evidence
that
it's
altogether
lacking
in
this
record.
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
--
i'm
not
mr.
justice
brennan
suggesting
a
particular
criteria.
i
think
it
is
obvious
that
the
commission
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
a
self-evident
that
in
determining
whether
to
recommend
federal
development
the
commission
must
first
look
to
whether
this
is
primarily
a
power
project
or
a
multipurpose
project,
whether
it
produces
power
only
for
itself
or
whether
it
controls
the
production
of
power
downstream,
whether
the
downstream
dams
are
federally
owned
or
nonfederally
owned.
how
important
relatively
these
non-power
functions
of
the
dam
are
as
compared
to
the
--
the
only
interest
of
the
private
operator
which
is
production
of
power.
i
think
these
are
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
suggesting
that
the
evidence
would
show
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
would
be
to
some
extent
expert
testimony.
it
would
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
commission
here
took
the
view
that
it
didn't
have
any
basis
for
making
any
such
conclusion
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
effect
that
it
was
harder
to
deal
with
a
private
power
owner
upstream.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
--
this
coordination
agreement
as
i
think
the
chief
justice
emphasized
deals
only
with
power.
it's
a
coordination
of
the
power
potential
of
the
dams
in
the
area.
it
is
limited
as
it
must
be
because
it's
a
contractual
arrangement.
first,
it
applies
only
to
the
members
and
no
one
is
forced
to
join
it.
some
have
refused
to
join
it
as
the
idaho
power
company
which
owns
these
three
upstream
dams
which
is
shown
because
it
must
be
paid
for
the
releases
which
it
made
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
that
is
true
also.
the
coordination
agreement
is
not
as
flexible
even
with
respect
to
power
coordination
as
would
be
the
operation
of
a
single
owner.
it
does
not
provide
for
hourly
exchanges
of
power,
hourly
releases.
it
must
and
we
don't
criticize
it
for
as
much
it's
the
best
that
can
be
done
as
--
as
mr.
luce
testified.
under
the
circumstances
of
a
system
which
has
a
group
of
despaired
owners,
that
is
not
to
say
and
of
course
mr.
luce
had
in
occasion
to
discuss
whether
it
would
be
preferable
to
have
a
coordinated
federal
system
even
from
the
power
plant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
say
did
the
--
the
act
is
almost
50
years
old,
to
say
50
years
experience
under
7
(b)
is
perhaps
an
exaggeration
and
there'd
been
no
recommendations
under
it
but
one
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
this
one
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
saint
lawrence
seaway
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
it
should
--
only
claim
made
in
chapman
by
the
secretary
as
i
read
it
was
that
the
approval
of
a
comprehensive
plan
for
that
particular
river
basin,
i
think
it
was
the
roanoke.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
carried
with
it
a
preemption
of
any
project
in
that
area
for
federal
development.
the
same
claim
was
advanced
in
this
case
in
that
the
original
plan
included
not
only
these
nine
downstream
dams
but
always
envisage
a
high
regulating
dam
at
the
top
of
this
cascade
and
the
argument
was
made,
we
do
not
urge
it
here
that
in
the
light
of
chapman
that
therefore
this
project
must
also
be
likened
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
they
emphasize
and
i
think
just
as
mr.
smith
pointed
out,
the
unusual
nature
of
this
dam
which
was
on
an
international
boundary
and
they
thought
it
was
to
ask
congress
whether
it
didn't
think
under
those
special
circumstances
federal
or
national
control
was
more
appropriate.
but
even
then
when
congress
failed
to
act
for
three
or
four
years
thereafter,
it
was
licensed
or
be
it
in
the
state
of
new
york
not
to
a
private
power
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
if
that
at
least
and
now
we
really
urged,
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
and
i
think
that
the
chapman
case
itself
makes
this
clear
that
in
every
case,
the
commission's
first
duty
which
it
cannot
defer
to
congress
or
to
the
secretary
about
is
to
determine
for
itself
whether
federal
development
is
appropriate
even
though
there
is
an
applicant
who
is
willing
in
terms
of
what
he
says
in
his
application
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
weighing
is
as
i've
suggested
the
--
the
peculiarities
of
the
project
in
question,
the
fact
that
it's
not
a
mere
run
of
the
river
project
solely
destined
to
create
power
for
itself
but
has
this
important
governmental
functions
to
perform
does
affect
the
system
of
federal
dams
downstream.
these
are
merely
--
some
of
the
elements
that
must
go
into
that
determination.
now,
the
act
does
not
tell
the
commission
how
to
go
about
it.
all
we
insist
is
that
it
do
seriously
consider
that
question
and
that
it
do
so
on
evidence.
here,
whatever
is
said
today
in
court,
the
commission
and
the
examiner
treated
this
as
a
new
issue
introduced
by
the
secretary
after
the
evidence
is
--
was
closed,
as
to
which
there
was
no
evidence.
and
the
court
of
appeal
affirmed
simply
on
the
ground
that
the
secretary
in
default
and
therefore
had
no
business
in
planning.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
me,
is
his
statement
at
that
particular
point
is
unexceptionable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
though
chapman
makes
it
clear
that
first
you
determine
whether
federal
department
is
appropriate
then
if
you
decide
against
federal
development.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
you
compare
the
advantages.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
the
--
the
approach
of
the
act,
that
if
the
private
applicant
can
do
it
as
well
as
the
government.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
if
they're
not
supported
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they're
not
supported
by
any
evidence.
the
mere
conclusions
since
the
examinee
himself
says
this
is
a
new
issue
the
secretary
introduce
--
introduced
after
the
evidence
was
closed.
the
only
reason
i
am
considering
it
is
because
the
commission
has
told
me
to
reopen
the
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
his
letter
not
any
testimony
therefore,
i'm
going
through
this
recital
of
the
possible
arguments
made
by
the
secretary
in
this
letter
which
i've
been
required
to
consider
and
i'm
rejecting
them
one
at
a
time.
i
--
but
he
--
i
think
he
had
no
evidence
on
which
to
do
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
that
i
must
say
that
i
am
--
i
am
advised
that
they're
all
strong
showings
that
could
be
made
on
the
remand
as
to
what
the
federal
government
in
specific
areas
could
do
better
job.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
respect
to
coordination
of
power
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
respect
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
the
one
aspect
is
the
--
the
rela
--
the
coordination
between
these
various
functions.how
do
you
weigh
whether
the
fish
are
more
important
or
the
flood
control
advantage
is
more
important
than
navigation
or
power?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
but
it
hasn't
done
the
job.
we
don't
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
can
only
accept
your
honors
words,
purports.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
white
the
commission
itself
says
in
so
many
words.
in
summary
the
delay
inherent
in
federal
construction
would
foreclose
power
coming
on
the
line
at
the
time
when
it
would
be
required.
this
disadvantage
outweighs
those
benefits
which
the
interior
contends
with
result
to
federal
construction
assuming
arguendo
that
such
benefits
would
be
realized
conceding
really
that
it
was
in
no
position
on
this
record
as
it
says
explicitly
earlier
on
to
assess
the
secretary's
claim
but
saying
in
any
event
he's
not
willing
to
build
it,
so
we
can't
seriously
look
to
that
alternative.
and
it's
the
failure
to
look
seriously
to
that
--
to
that
alternative
seems
to
us
to
be
the
--
the
error
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
trial
examiner
also
says
that
there
is
no
evidence
upon
which
he
can
find,
that
federal
development
is
superior,
that
it's
always
put
into
negative
and
has
to
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
it
--
it
was
an
expressed
concern
by
those
who
favored
governmental
power
to
make
sure
that
they
would
remain
an
area
for
federal
development
and
as
one
of
the
chairman
of
one
of
the
committees
put
it,
the
government
would
retain
first
right
on
its
waterways,
first
right
over
any
public
utility
of
private
power
applicant.
