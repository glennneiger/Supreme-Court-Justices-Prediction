mr.
hugh
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
mention
sedimentation
first
if
i
could
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
can't
give
you
any
record
citation
because
there
aren't
any,
but
i
think
that
because
it's
not
an
issue
of
the
case,
no
one
will
object
if
i
will
tell
you
the
story.
we
did
a
study
on
sedimentation
on
the
earlier
project
to
determine
whether
we
were
anticipating
a
problem
in
the
pleasant
valley
reservoir
that
would
affect
its
economic
value
over
the
life
of
the
license
or
the
probable
economic
life
of
the
project.
we
ran
this
out
to
100
years.
we
discovered
that
at
100
years
that
we
were
not
at
that
point
affecting
the
power
generation
of
the
storage
space
so
we
stopped
at
that
point.
now,
i
can't
really
say
to
you
there's
no
problem
but
at
100
years,
we
had
so
little
deposit
of
sediment
in
that
reservoir
that
it
was
completely
insignificant.
so
i
think
we
have
no
sedimentation
problem.
what
happens
on
the
snake
if
i
might
take
one
more
moment,
it
looks
awfully
dirty
when
you
look
at
it.
and
you'd
think
you
have
sedimentation.
actually,
that
river,
the
sediment
in
it,
so
called
sedimentary
is
so
finely
ground
up
that
it
runs
right
straight
through.
it
doesn't
fall
out
in
these
reservoirs.
the
other
thing
is
that
those
particles
that
do
fall
out,
there
are
as
you
probably
know,
mr.
justice,
a
great
number
of
reservoirs
upstream
in
this
area.
so
they
are
picking
this
up.
i
might
say
our
sedimentation
study
assumes
sedimentation
of
these
upper
reservoirs
up
to
a
100
period.
the
argument
that
mr.
ely
presents
to
you
--
what
i
think
be
a
very
persuasive
argument
if
we
were
dealing
here
with
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
hugh
smith
yes,
and
we
do
have
some
dams
of
that
sort.
i
might
say,
mr.
justice,
later
studies,
since
those
studies
have
indicated
that
was
a
little
bit
pessimistic.
even
150
years
is
pessimistic
and
not
that
most
of
those
projects
that
were
involved
in
that
would
probably
go
up
to
200
and
250,
which
point
that
gets
beyond
the
area
in
which
at
least
i'm
worried
about
it.
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
hugh
smith
i
know
of
it,
sir.
i
have
not
seen
it.
i'm
not
been
on
the
wanachi
but
i
know
of
the
dam.
i
know
of
the
situation
and
we
do
have
some
coastal
streams
also
where
the
sedimentation
question
is
substantial,
where
we're
going
to
--
some
of
those
will
fill
up
within
the
economic
life
of
the
project
and
they'll
then
operate
as
one
of
their
projects.
but
in
this
area,
it
doesn't
look
like
a
problem.
what
mr.
ely
has
presented
to
you
would
be
an
effective
argument
if
we
were
dealing
here
with
the
deed.
we
were
dealing
here
with
a
mineral
lease
under
the
minerals
laws
or
an
entry
of
any
sort
under
the
land
laws
of
the
united
states.
but
we're
not
dealing
with
the
deed
or
mineral
lease
or
an
entry.
we're
dealing
with
something
else.
i
think
it
is
used
of
something
like
the
mineral
leases
is
useful.
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
laws
that
give
you
any
protection
to
preliminary
exploration
that
you
make
before
you
locate
your
plant.
the
protection
that
you
get
is
after
you
locate
plants,
so
you're
at
the
risk
whatever
you
spend
to
decide
where
you're
likely
to
find
mineralization.
that's
the
specific
purpose
of
the
preliminary
permit,
however,
under
the
federal
power
act
is
to
give
you
protection
of
the
investment
that
you
are
making
when
you
go
out
to
see
if
you
can
find
a
project.
well,
that
investment
can
be
quite
heavy
and
our
problem
i
think,
the
split
between
us
here
is
that
mr.
ely
seeks
to
read
the
act
as
being
one
specifically
to
promote
public
ownership.
this
is
the
purpose
that
i
have
been
unable
to
perceive
either
in
the
language
of
the
act
or
any
part
of
the
congressional
history
nor
certainly
has
this
court
perceived
it
on
previous
occasions
when
it's
had
occasion
to
examine
the
provisions
of
the
federal
power
act.
instead,
this
court
has
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
encourage
investment,
the
private
capital.
now
i
think
we've
got
to
make
clear
when
we
say
private
capital
here
that
we're
including
public
capital
of
agency
such
as
mr.
ely's
clients.
this
is
non-federal
capital
when
we
say
private.
i
think
also
it's
clear
if
you
read
the
congressional
record
that
members
of
congress
did
not
consider
that
bodies
such
as
mr.
ely
represents
we're
going
to
be
a
significant
element
in
the
development
of
the
natural
resource
of
the
country.
and
that
they
in
fact
rather
expected
that
if
this
act
was
successful
in
encouraging
investment
of
capital,
it
would
be
successful
primarily
in
encouraging
what
is
normally
thought
of
as
private
company.
now,
if
there
is
preference
in
this
act,
the
other
problem
we
have
with
mr.
ely
is
that
he
thinks
this
is
a
problem
of
preference.
now,
we
do
not
regard
the
question
of
public
preference
and
the
policy
that
lies
behind
this
as
involved
in
this
case.
the
preference
in
the
federal
power
act
is
unequivocal.
there's
no
discretion
given
to
the
commission
as
to
whether
the
grant
or
denial
assuming
that
the
preference
applicant
isn't
otherwise
a
qualified
applicant.
incidentally
so,
i
don't
lose
this
point
towards
at
the
end
of
the
time,
it
should
be
clear,
we
deny
that
mr.
ely's
client
are
a
qualified
preference
applicant
for
a
number
of
reasons.
this
has
never
been
passed
upon
by
the
commission,
has
it
already
been
indicated
to
you
so
that
matter
is
not
actually
before
this
court.
but
if
there
is
a
qualified
applicant,
the
commission
has
absolutely
no
discretion
at
all.the
preference
applicant
gets
the
permit.
now,
mr.
ely
cited
to
you
in
his
main
brief
before
it,
series
of
statutes
which
he
referred
to
as
the
seamless
web
of
power
policy.
i
have
been
unable
to
weave
a
web
out
of
that
myself.
the
different
provisions
of
those
different
acts
all
which
have
to
do
with
marketing
--
federal
power,
doesn't
seemed
to
be
relevant,
go
off
in
various
directions.
there
are
different
emphases
upon
different
thing.
there's
one
thing
that's
rather
clear,
however
throughout
all
those
acts
they
specify
a
point
in
time
for
the
preferences
to
be
–
is
to
be
exercised,
and
that,
gentlemen,
is
the
whole
issue
of
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
congress
has
made
quite
clear
that
the
way
in
which
they
are
going
to
put
together
the
problem
of
encouraging
private
capital
to
come
in,
of
encouraging
them
to
spend
money
which
may
be
a
substantial
amount
of
money
to
go
out
and
explore
for
and
investigate
an
engineer
and
develop
a
project
that
will
be
best
adapted
to
a
comprehensive
plan
as
superlative
requirement
of
the
federal
power
act.
that
the
way
to
match
this
with
their
desire
to
accord
a
preference
to
those
rare
occasions
when
a
municipality,
a
city
might
want
to
build
is
to
say
to
the
city,
“come
in
before
the
private
company
has
spent
all
of
this
money”.
another
passages
that
we
cite
to
you
in
our
brief
from
the
congressional
history
in
this
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
merrill,
who
was
then
the
chief
engineer
of
the
forest
service
as
indicated
as
the
author
of
this
act
and
became
the
first
secretary
of
the
commission,
where
mr.
merrill
pointed
out
that
a
private
company
might
spend
even
as
much
as
a
$100,000
or
$200,000
on
going
in
to
explore
in
developing
a
project
and
then
it
would
be
quite
unfair,
quite
unfair
to
let
a
city
come
in
and
push
them
out
at
the
last
moment.
well,
this
is
the
issue.
this
is
--
depends
on
how
you're
going
to
regard
this
act.
if
you
start
off
looking
at
this
act
as
being
passed
and
adopted
by
congress
with
the
purpose
of
developing
a
resource,
in
other
words,
if
you
look
at
the
resource
we're
talking
about,
we
have
no
problems.
the
resource
we're
talking
about
comes
from
approximately
nez
perce
to
approximately
high
mountain
sheep.
it
can
be
done
by
engineering
structures.
we've
been
talking
about
three
of
them
as
though
there
are
only
three
alternatives,
actually
there
are
dozens
of
other
alternatives
up
there.
this
place
is
just
rightful
as
dam
sites
all
the
way.
but
it
can
be
done
anyway,
but
the
resource
that
we're
talking
about
is
that.
and
the
issue
that
we're
talking
about
or
that
we
were
talking
about
before
the
commission
is
not
really
exactly
how
you
develop
this
from
power
and
flood
control.
those
issues
were
well-defined.
they
were
how
important
this
fish.
from
the
very
first
government
report
that
we
have
on
record
which
incidentally
was
from
high
mountain
sheep
not
from
nez
perce,
this
is
a
report
of
the
district
engineer
in
1947
down
to
the
present.
the
issue
on
that
river
has
been
how
do
you
find
a
project
whereby
you
can
provide
all
of
the
public
purposes
that
we
have
available
here
and
still
get
adequate
protection
to
fish.
now
this
quickly
defined
itself
into
the
fact
that
either
you
build
below,
which
is
nez
perce,
there
are
three
or
four
sites
where
you
might
put
nez
perce
dam
depending
on
just
what
its
engineering
is.
or
you
build
above,
the
mouth
of
the
salmon
river.
now
the
reason
you
go
on
and
focus
on
the
salmon
is
that
this
is
the
enormous
spawning
stream
for
the
salmon
resource.
in
terms
of
relative
magnitude,
there
is
something
around
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
two
thirds
of
all
of
the
salmon
that
pass
the
mcnary
dam
come
up
to
the
nez
perce
project.
it's
about
200,000,
of
that
--
about
220,000
--
now
that
220,000,
about
180,000
turn
and
go
up
the
salmon
river.
about
25,000
used
to
go
up
the
snake
and
somewhere
between
5,000
and
9,000
go
up
the
imnaha.
now
that's
our
resource.
what
do
you
do
with
that?
obviously,
the
critical
one
is
the
salmon
river.
obviously,
the
critical
question
is
above
or
below
the
salmon
river?
now,
this
has
always
been
the
issue.
we
have
a
subsidiary
issue
because
you
can
--
you
got
several
places
above
the
salmon
river
which
in
turn
or
above
the
imnaha
river
which
are
all
called
“mountain
sheep”
in
various
variations
which
have
storage
in
various
variations.
we
have
the
one
that's
licensed
that
has
3,100,000
acre
feet
of
storage.
there's
a
high
mountain
sheep
site
right
above
the
mouth
of
the
imnaha
that
has
about
2,800,000
acre
feet
of
usable
storage.
then
there's
the
pleasant
valley,
then
there's
a
low
mountain
sheep
with
the
storage
in
that
case
--
pleasant
valley
that
had
about
500,000
acre
feet
of
storage.
alright,
these
are
the
problems.
we
got
a
preliminary
permit.
mr.
ely
says
that
we
make
some
choices,
that
we
make
some
exclusion
in
this.
all
we
did
was
that
we
follow
the
rules
of
the
commission.
same
rules
the
commission
has
had
ever
since
1922.
it
says
that
you
pick
out
a
project
and
describe
it.
it's
specific.
it
doesn't
say
that
we
can
come
in
and
then
list
the
alternatives.
it
says
a
project.
with
what
we
then
knew,
we
thought
mountain
sheep,
pleasant
valley
was
the
most
likely
frontrunner
and
we
described
that.
we
got
a
permit
that
said
that
we
proposed
to
build
a
project
in
the
snake
river.
this
was
the
definition
of
our
project.
a
project
located
on
the
snake
river,
in
the
counties
of
idaho
--
in
idaho
county,
idaho
and
wallowa
county,
oregon.
now
at
this
point,
the
question
is
what
did
we
have?
it's
not
a
question
of
retroactivity
or
anything
like
that.
the
question
is,
what
did
that
document
vest
us
with?
one
of
the
things
which
is
not
fully
irrelevant
here
is
what
did
we
understand?
we
did
not
understand
this
document
the
way
in
which
mr.
ely
now
professes
to
understand
it
because
we
didn't
confine
the
work
that
we
did
to
those
two
particular
projects.
we
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
examining
the
geology
of
the
high
dam
above
the
imnaha,
which
was
not
on
the
same
axis
at
all
as
the
mountain
sheep
dam
that
was
described
in
the
preliminary
permit.
we
found
that
it
was
geologically
imprudent
to
build
a
dam
there.
we
did
not
ignore
what
we
now
know
as
the
high
mountain
sheep
dam
and
we
so
testified.
we
gave
serious
consideration
on
whether
we
should
undertake
engineering
studies
of
the
dam
below
the
imnaha
and
we
concluded,
as
we
have
testified,
that
at
that
time
that
it
should
not
be
undertaken
because
of
the
interest
of
protecting
fish
in
the
imnaha
river.
i
should
know
the
commission
disagreed
with
us.
but
essentially,
we
find
out
they
are
during
our
permit
period
was
a
--
this
--
that
is
that
the
only
place
we
could
find
it
and
that
is
that
our
judgment
on
the
fish
was
not
the
one
that
was
going
to
prevail
in
the
public
interest
here
by
the
only
agency
that
can
make
it,
which
is
the
federal
power
commission.
so
having
explored
and
found
out
all
of
the
necessary
things
during
the
permit
period,
we
then
filed
exactly
what
the
statutory
plan
calls
for
his
to
file,
that
was
an
application
for
license
on
the
project
which
is
now
been
held
to
be
with
this
project.
i
must
make
a
few
further
points
very
quickly.
let
me
say
that
we
have
suddenly
faced
in
this
court
was
an
argument
by
mr.
ely
that
his
alleged
better
project
justifies
itself
a
reversal
and
a
remand.
now,
there's
been
very
little
said
about
this
argument
below
or
in
the
briefs
to
this
court
because
it
had
never
been
presented
as
being
a
subsidy
question
before.
i've
got
to
say
to
this
court
flatly
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
statement
is
wrong.
we
filed
two
different
designs
with
the
commission.
one
was
for
1,225,000
kilowatts,
the
larger
project
and
the
one
that's
finally
licensed.
the
other
was
for
875.
the
difference
is
between
those
or
in
peaking
not
in
energy
and
we
maintain
and
we
explain
to
the
commission
that
the
reason
was
that
for
a
temporary
period
of
time
of
about
five
years,
there
was
a
surplus
of
machine
capability
in
the
northwest
which
made
this
extra
400,000
kilowatts
of
peaking
of
no
significant
economic
value.
we
also
stated
that
we
would
propose
to
put
in
the
largest
--
that
we
had
taken
the
largest
projects
that
were
then
available
for
use
that
we
could
design
into
this
project,
that
would
be
supplying
to
us
by
the
generating
companies
as
of
the
time
that
is
on
it.
there
has
been
progress
in
the
art.
by
the
time
we
got
the
hearing,
wppss
had
a
larger
generator.
we
would
--
then
went
back
to
the
generating
companies
and
discovered
they
were
then
willing
to
put
in
even
a
larger
one.
figures
here
are
200,000
kilowatts
for
a
(inaudible),
the
one
that
we
found
that
were
larger
were
250,000.
the
court
may
be
interested
to
know
that
up
to
a
few
weeks
ago,
we
had
tended
--
we'll
settle
on
471,000
kilowatt
units
that
would
go
in
in
the
initial
installation
because
the
art
has
just
been
leaping
ahead
quickly.
it's
leaped
so
fast
that
even
a
few
weeks
ago,
we
went
back
to
our
engineering
company
and
told
them
to
restudy
this
in
view
of
the
announcement
of
the
600,000
units
that
would
go
into
grand
cooley.
now,
this
is
the
only
thing
that
is
similar
at
all
to
the
--
this
is
the
only
thing
that
it's
similar
at
all
to
the
design.
it's
been
provided
by
the
wppss
in
this
proceeding
is
the
size
of
the
image
because
the
initial
installation
is
our
plan,
the
ultimate
installation
is
our
plan.
mr.
ely
has
some
figures
that
he
may
give
you
on
rebuttal
that
would
--
seems
to
say
the
ultimate
installation
is
larger
but
this
isn't
quite
true
because
his
units
cannot
actually
produce
the
--
mr.
hugh
smith
no,
sir.
the
lower
canyon
project
is
part
of
what
is
known
as
the
high
mountain
sheep
plant
and
in
demonstrating
that
independent
of
fish,
the
high
mountain
sheep
project
was
better
than
nez
perce.
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
demonstrate
that
you
could
develop
the
salmon
river
with
a
--
with
an
economic
project.
now,
that
--
where
the
two
projects
would
be
better
than
nez
perce,
but
we
have
specifically
said
that
we
would
not
take
a
license
for
lower
canyon
until
and
if
the
fish
passage
problem
is
conclusively
solved
and
finally
solved.
mr.
hugh
smith
thank
you
very
much
sir.
mr.
hugh
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
solomon
has
struck
to
at
some
length
about
the
nature
and
condition
of
the
record
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
continue
it
with
just
one
further
point
of
consideration.
the
secretary
said
in
his
brief
that
it's
part
of
the
burden
of
proof
of
an
applicant
to
acquire
a
license
under
the
federal
power
act
that
the
applicant
demonstrate
that
he
will
produce
as
good
a
dam
as
the
federal
--
good
a
project
as
the
federal
project
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
advantages
of
federal
development
one
of
the
several
phraseologies
of
this
that
the
secretary
has
used
in
his
brief.
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
discuss
with
you
the
problem
that
is
presented
to
an
applicant
that
was
presented
to
me
in
preparing
and
presenting
this
case
to
the
commission.
we
were
perfectly
well
aware
of
section
7
(b)
as
mr.
solomon
told
you,
we
just
finished
the
case
in
which
that
was
the
major
argument
against
issuing
us
a
license,
we
thought
to
have
lost
it
on
another
ground.
and
we
--
we
had
made
the
case
at
that
time
relevant
to
the
problems
of
why
you
should
have
a
private
project
instead
of
a
public
private
and
we
prepared
this
case
because
we
thought
we
had
the
same
argument
all
over
again.
again,
we're
wrong.
it
turned
out
to
be
a
different
argument.
but
our
evidence
was
prepared
with
the
idea
in
mind
that
we
had
to
satisfy
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
federal
power
act
as
mr.
solomon
said
we
don't
have
a
label
on
it.
we
don't
any
place
say
now
we
are
testifying
the
7
(b)
here,
now,
were
testifying
section
10
(a).
but
certainly
we
knew
this
and
knowing
this
the
evidence
that
as
an
applicant
we
put
in
to
something
like
this.
we
produced
evidence,
this
is
engineering
testimony.
its
highly
technical
testimony
was
produced
through
a
--
a
witness
on
our
part
was
an
acknowledged
expert
in
this
field
that
project
was
designed
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
capable
of
producing
not
at
site
but
in
the
area
as
a
whole,
in
the
whole
columbia
river
basin,
the
maximum
amount
of
usable
power
over
the
life
of
the
project.
now,
this
apparently
is
conceded
by
the
secretary
that
we
have
designed
such
project
because
the
secretary
says
that
they
will
build
substantially
the
same
project
as
we
would
propose
to
build
if
they
got
the
recommendation.
now,
we
knew
we've
been
in
the
power
business
for
a
long,
long
time.
we've
helped
set
up
the
northwest
power
pool.
we
were
engaged
in
the
negotiations
for
the
coordination
agreement
while
we
were
before
the
commission.
we
knew
that
we
couldn't
get
that
maximum
amount
in
the
area
as
a
whole.
this
is
what
we're
calling
coordination.
unless
we
got
agreement
from
other
parties,
so
we
also
introduced
evidence,
well
let
me
first
say
that
in
our
license
application
itself,
we
stated,
that
we
had
designed
the
project
for
full
coordination.
and
we
stated
furthermore
in
the
application
itself
that
we
propose
to
operate
that
project
in
full
coordination
so
as
to
get
the
maximum
amount
of
power.
we,
therefore,
went
as
far
as
that
stage
as
we
could
to
commit
to
ourselves
to
the
operations
of
this
project
in
the
proper
manner.
we
produced
evidence
that
we
would
have
to
have
an
agreement
in
order
to
have
the
optimum
operation.
we
produced
evidence
which
is
in
the
form
of
expert
opinion
evidence
i
suppose
on
behalf
of
our
chairman
of
the
board
who
is
the
utility
executive
of
some
four
years
experienced
that
in
his
judgment
the
advantages
of
full
coordination
would
in
fact
bring
the
parties
in
the
northwest,
some
15
of
them
together
in
an
agreement
in
the
life
of
this
project.
as
mr.
solomon
point
out,
the
opposing
applicant
was
rather
less
sanguine
about
it.
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
or
at
the
end
of
the
case
the
opposing
applicant
came
right
around
to
our
view
and
as
the
events
demonstrate
our
judgment
was
correct
and
mr.
solomon
pointed
out
actually
it
came
a
little
bit
further.
now,
this
is
the
why
in
which
we
show
that
as
far
as
power
is
concerned
and
this
includes
not
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
secretary's
map
which
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
its
exceptions
to
examine
the
opinion
is
it
that
it's
rather
interesting
here
on
the
snake
river
but
at
least
out
of
the
columbia
river
basin.
and
after
all
down
about
here,
above
the
mcnary,
there's
a
little
stop
that
goes
on
with
the
rest
of
the
columbia
river.
and
until
you
get
the
entire
basin
in,
you
cannot
start
handling
the
problems
that
we're
talking
about
in
coordination.
the
differences
are
rather
significant.
i'll
come
to
this
in
a
moment.
but
our
evidence
on
coordination
was
intended
to
show
that
there
would
be
coordination
not
just
with
these
projects
but
with
the
entire
complex
systems
throughout
the
columbia
river
basin.
and
as
--
as
matters
of
eventuated
this
is
what
we're
going
to
have.
no
evidence
on
navigation,
well
our
evidence
on
flood
control
which
is
a
little
bit
more
significant
was
first
we
designed
that
project
with
the
necessary
facilities
reflected
through,
in
terms
of
facilities
this
is
the
question
of
size
of
the
turbines
and
the
installation
low
level
sluices
and
various
other
facilities
of
this
sort.
those
facilities
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
those
corps
of
engineers
wanted
this
particular
project.
we
said
we'd
operated
for
flood
control,
our
power
studies
reflected
operation
of
this
project,
the
flood
control
at
such
time
as
it
was
supposed
to
be
operated
for
flood
control.
and
that
was
put
into
the
record.
we
put
it
in
as
our
exhibit
because
we
thought
it
was
so
important
but
it
also
went
in
independently.
the
formal
statement
of
the
chief
of
the
corps
of
engineers
that
he
had
examined
our
plans
and
that
he
was
satisfied
that
this
project
under
license
to
us
would
provide
the
same
flood
control
as
would
a
project
designed
and
built
by
him.
now,
that's
part
of
the
record
evidence
on
which
the
commission
is
acting.
substantially,
the
same
thing
is
said
about
navigation.
and
actually
navigation
in
this
particular
project
is
practically
de
minimis,
it's
a
negative
benefit
you
--
you
--
until
the
downstream
dam
of
china
gardens
is
built
that
maintain
the
minimum
flows
in
the
river
not
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
navigation.
we
don't
have
navigation
benefit.
but
still
the
project
has
got
to
be
designed
to
operate
in
that
manner.
we
did
so,
we
include
that
in
our
power
studies
and
the
chief
of
the
corps
of
engineers
made
exactly
the
same
point
as
the
navigation.
now,
essentially,
we
have
done
exactly
on
every
one
of
these
other
public
purposes,
we
have
done
the
same
thing.
on
recreation
which
is
a
difficult
thing
to
--
to
--
you
can't
get
this
down
in
the
engineering
terms
like
you
do
on
these
others.
on
recreation
what
we
have
done
is
adopt
then,
i
think,
improve
on
the
plans
of
the
forest
service
which
is
the
agency
that
has
control
practically
all
of
the
government
land
for
all
practical
purposes
of
the
whole
reservoir
because
most
of
the
reservoir
area
is
government
land.
we
have
--
we
have
followed
those
plans.
we,
as
i
say,
i
think
we've
improved
on
them
somewhat.
on
fish,
good
heavens,
this
was
one
of
the
major
questions
before
the
commission.
there
was
evidence
not
only
by
us
but
by
everybody
as
to
what
had
to
be
done
about
fish,
what
the
problems
were,
how
they
were
best
handled.our
contribution
there
was
a
rather
unique
solution,
problem
of
the
imnaha
river
which
put
rather
briefly
and
therefore
somewhat
inaccurately
amounted
to
constructing
in
our
official
channel
of
the
imnaha
that
were
carried
around
the
dam
and
deposit
that
in
the
snake
river
border
of
the
dam.
now,
if
i
can
summarize,
what
we
presented
was
evidence
tended
to
prove
that
we
would
produce
the
project
designed
and
built
by
us
and
operated
by
us
would
produce
the
maximum
amount
of
power
in
the
area
as
a
whole,
usable
power.
and
that
we
propose
them
soon.
the
evidence
introduced
tended
to
show
that
we
would
produce
exactly
the
flood
control
of
the
federal
project
would
produce,
exactly
the
navigation
benefits
of
the
federal
project
would
produce,
that
would
we
--
we
would
do
as
well
if
not
better
for
fish
and
the
federal
government
would
do.
mr.
hugh
smith
the
description
of
the
entire
fish
facilities
was
a
little
bit
complicated
mr.
justice
potter.
there
will
be
fish
ladders
at
them
itself.
the
channel
extends
up
the
imnaha
river
from
the
dam
to
the
head
of
the
imnaha
river,
a
distance
--
the
channel
itself
will
be
about
15
miles.
the
actual
distance
on
the
imnaha
river
just
a
little
over
seven
miles
so
that
you
then
come
down
to
the
more
or
less
conventional
fish
ladder
although
it's
somewhat
unconventional
and
tight.
mr.
hugh
smith
well,
the
problem
is
both
ways
if
you
got
a
great
reservoir.
the
problem
is
to
keep
them
out
of
the
reservoir
basically
is
what
we
could
term
a
hitch.
mr.
hugh
smith
well,
we
can
keep
them
out
of
the
turbines.
the
river
problem
is
that
the
major
reservoir
creates
an
ecological
condition
and
that
the
fish
don't
know
what
to
do
with
going
in
either
direction.
so
you
have
to
keep
them
out
of
the
reservoir.
now,
we
keep
the
adults
out
by
diverting
them
into
this
channel.
the
fray
coming
down
are
rather
easy
to
handle
because
they're
small
and
we
install
what
is
known
as
revolving
fish
stream
which
is
a
fairly
conventional
piece
of
machinery
at
the
headwater
of
the
reservoir
on
the
imnaha
river
and
that
diverts
the
fish
in
--
back
into
the
channel.
the
-
the
little
fish,
the
baby
fish
coming
up.
and
by
that
means,
they
bypass
them
coming
down
also.
so
this
is
the
way
we
keep
them
out
of
the
reservoir
entirely.
now,
it
happens
because
this
is
a
very
short
arm.
you
can
do
something
about
this
and
the
imnaha
itself
while
a
very
beautiful
stream
has
at
flow,
it's
comparably
small
that
we
can
effectively
handle
this
kind
of
a
device.
it's
not
something
that
probably
could
be
used
any
place
else.
but
this
is
something
we
developed,
this
was
our
idea.
this
is
our
contribution
and
it
has
gone
so
far
that
we
have
as
the
court
knows
the
support
of
the
state
fish
and
game
agencies
of
the
three
states,
oregon,
washington
and
idaho.
well,
the
support
most
uniquely
of
all
of
the
--
the
wildlife
groups
in
the
--
in
the
area,
the
wildlife
federations
(inaudible)
linked
in
the
area
which
never
support
a
dam
at
all.
they're
always
against
all
dams.
but
they
have
supported
this
and
they're
here
before
this
court
in
support
of
us
in
our
position
both
to
the
government
and
to
the
licensee
--
to
the
opposing
petitioner
in
the
--
in
the
next
case.
now,
i
can
suggest
out
of
this
--
this
problem
that
with
all
of
this
proof
that
we
will
produce
the
maximum
power,
all
of
the
navigation,
all
of
the
flood
control,
that's
physically
possible
for
anybody
who
produce,
that
we
do
better
for
fish
than
the
government
would
do,
that
we're
going
to
do
exactly
what
ought
to
be
done
for
recreation,
did
better
or
best
whatever
that
is.
that
is
our
proof
but
secretary
says
to
this
court
that
that's
not
enough.
that
we
have
to
go
further,
that
we
have
a
burden
of
proving
something
else.
now,
what
is
that
something
else?
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
since
the
secretary
came
in
first
with
this
position
in
1962
in
every
single
filing
that
has
been
made
since
then,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
sign
of
--
of
any
indication
of
evidence
to
support
the
argument.
this
is
still
true
here.
mr.
hugh
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
saying
at
the
beginning
of
the
recess
that
for
a
period
of
time
since
1962
since
the
secretary
first
made
up
his
mind
that
he
thought
there
was
some
reason
for
federal
construction
of
high
mountain
sheep,
we
have
been
asking
what
that
reason
is
and
not
at
anytime
before
the
commission,
not
before
the
court
below
and
once
again
not
before
this
court
fave
we
heard
set
forth
any
indication
that
there
is
evidence
as
to
any
superiority
of
federal
construction
--
mr.
hugh
smith
i
know
there
isn't.
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
hugh
smith
mr.
justice
white,
the
commission
knows
there
isn't
on
the
same
basis
that
i
know
there
isn't.
and
that
is
that
we
know
what
is
possible
to
be
done
with
this
project.
we
know
about
the
downstream
projects,
we
know
how
to
run
a
power
system,
as
we
know
and
as
the
commission
knows.
we
know
what
is
involved
in
flood
control.
this
is
a
matter
that's
been
before
the
commission
many
times.
my
--
the
constituent
agency
companies
of
pacific
northwest
power
company
have
a
number
of
projects
that
are
operated
for
flood
control.
out
of
all
of
these
we
know
there
is
nothing
that
the
secretary
is
going
to
produce
because
as
i've
outlined
before,
we
have
designed
this
project
and
we
proposed
to
operate
it
for
the
maximum
physical
possibility
of
all
of
these
public
benefits.
now,
they
--
perhaps
there's
something
wrong
in
our
proof,
there
has
been
no
suggestion
by
the
secretary
at
any
time
that
there's
anything
wrong
in
our
proof.
perhaps,
obviously
if
there
were
contested
issue,.
the
commission
might
be
entitled
not
to
believe
our
proof
or
the
proof
of
the
opposing
applicant
or
the
proof
of
their
own
stand,
all
of
which
went
in
independently
or
the
material
and
information
in
technical
studies
of
the
corps
of
engineers.
mr.
hugh
smith
oh!
i
think
as
--
as
mr.
solomon
said
to
you
there
is
inherent
in
every
license
procedure
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
issue
of
potential
federal
construction
and
each
time
there's
a
license
i
think
it
is
the
duty
of
the
commission
to
consider
whether
there
is
any
reason
to
believe
within
their
knowledge
and
judgment
of
the
area
as
to
whether
there
is
an
advantage
for
federal
construction.
what
we're
saying
to
you
essentially
sir
is
that
in
the
hands
of
a
series
of
experts,
of
expert
witnesses,
of
engineers,
the
expert
examination
of
the
project
is
we
designed
it
and
proposed
and
operated
by
the
staff,
the
testimony
of
the
corps
of
engineers,
an
enormous
amount
of
experience
in
close
cooperation
and
coordination
in
this
area.
the
question
is
not
whether
this
should
be
examined
because
we
assert
firmly
it
was
examined.
it
was
examined
exhaustively.
we
assert
firmly
that
everything
that
was
necessary
to
an
intelligent
rational
decision
was
before
the
commission
on
this.
the
question,
i
think,
is
if
there
is
a
question
to
be
raised
at
all,
was
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
commission
should
go
forward?
did
the
commission
give
any
indication
in
its
opinion
that
it
felt
that
it
was
justified
in
acting
as
it
did
because
the
record
was
inadequate,
on
any
fair
reading
to
that
opinion
as
a
whole?
that
it
seems
to
me
comes
down
to
the
only
question
that
can
be
decided.
we're
not
an
issue
here
at
law.
we've
got
a
curious
issue
of
facts.
and
this
--
mr.
hugh
smith
well,
it
is.
mr.
hugh
smith
by
no
means,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
hugh
smith
section
7
(b)
says
that
if
in
the
judgment
of
the
commission,
development
of
water
resources
should
be
undertaken
by
the
united
states
itself.
mr.
hugh
smith
i
--
there
is
no
question
mr.
justice
black
that
there
can
very
well
be
instances
where
the
reason
for
considering
a
federal
construction
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
proof
in
this
case.
the
one
recommendation
that
has
been
made
by
commission
to
the
congress
illustrates
i
think
that
type
of
a
situation.
now,
this
involved
development
to
saint
lawrence
waterway
and
the
question
that
moves
the
commission
to
send
that
to
congress
was
that
they
felt
that
congress
should
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
a
single
governmental
entity
should
develop
that
waterway
because
of
the
relationship
with
canada
or
whether
it
could
be
developed
by
different
entities
one
or
more
under
license
to
the
commission.
mr.
hugh
smith
let
me
answer
the
question
partly
yes
sir.
there
is
no
question
that
the
issue
of
the
relationship
of
high
mountain
sheep
to
the
downstream
dams
was
a
valid
proper
one
for
the
secretary
to
raise
with
the
commission.
the
secretary
raised
that
--
mr.
hugh
smith
well
and
that
it
--
i'm
sorry
sir,
in
either
case
it
is
something
proper
for
the
commission
to
decide,
to
consider,
excuse
me.
mr.
hugh
smith
no,
they
don't
have
to
wait.
this
responsibility
is
not
in
the
secretary.
this
responsibility
is
in
the
commission
and
in
the
applicant.
as
the
secretary
says
--
mr.
hugh
smith
pardon
sir.
mr.
hugh
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
hugh
smith
this
is
the
secretary's
argument
mr.
justice
black,
not
mine.
this
argument
is
because
of
the
physical
relationship
--
mr.
hugh
smith
well,
it's
part
of
it.
this
argument
is
because
of
the
physical
relationship
of
this
project,
the
downstream
project
there
should
be
a
single
operator.
and
that
this
would
justify
federal
ownership.
this
is
a
--
a
completely
legitimate
point.
i
see
mr.
chief
justice
that
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
hugh
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
me,
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
notice
which
is
the
essential
nexus
of
the
argument
made
by
mr.
ely
in
this
particular
case.
in
accordance
with
the
statute
in
1955,
the
federal
power
commission
gave
notice
of
our
application
for
a
preliminary
permit.
and
the
question
that
mr.
ely
raises
is
what
at
that
point
happens.
now
whatever
that
notice
meant
to
anybody
or
to
mr.
ely
or
anyone
else,
there's
one
thing
quite
clear.
it
did
not
mean
that
we
were
going
to
build
the
project
described
in
that
notice
because
as
mr.
solomon
explained
to
you
at
some
length
yesterday
and
as
i've
commented,
this
is
the
one
thing
you
do
know,
and
that
experience
is
shown
that
everybody
involved
in
this
particular
activity
knows
that
it
is
so
unlikely
that
anything
is
going
to
come
up,
its
exactly
what's
describe.
anyone
reading
that
notice
knew
that
whatever
else
it
might
mean
it
did
not
mean
that
that
was
the
project
that
was
going
to
be
built.
now
we
say
that
the
notice
served
its
statutory
purpose.
and
that
is
that
there
had
been
set
in
motion
this
statutory
process
which
would
eventuate
in
a
project
best
adapted
to
a
comprehensive
plan
within
the
standards
of
section
10
(a).
and,
that
consequently
anyone
who
had
purposes
or
plans
or
ambitions
that
would
be
affected
by
that
eventuality
were
on
notice
that
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
come
in
and
take
the
obligation,
undertake
the
obligation
if
they
wished
to
assert
a
preference
to
undertake
the
obligation
to
carry
out
the
expirations
to
develop
the
particular
project.
now,
viewed
in
light
of
this
statutory
purpose,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
scope
that
the
commission
has
given
to
a
preliminary
permit
is
a
very
sensible
and
workable
rule.
because
what
the
commission
has
said
in
this
case
is
that
a
permit
applies
to
the
project
described,
to
any
project
that
is
mutually
exclusive
so
long
as
it
occupies
substantially
the
same
reach
of
the
river
and
substan
--
and
develops
substantially
the
same
head.
now
the
phrase
is
substantially
the
same,
are
concepts
that
are
very
familiar
to
lawyers,
something
that
violate
is
not
an
exact
rule.
it
is
something
that
lawyers
are
accustomed
to
apply.
reach
and
head
are
of
course
more
engineering
terms
but
they're
very
familiar
to
engineers,
and
the
engineers
are
the
people
who
are
involved
in
this
kind
of
a
thing
we're
talking
about.
and
it's
very
workable
to
them,
and
mutually
exclusive
as
something
that
anybody
even
the
layman
can
easily
see
once
they
look
at
the
map.
even
this
map
by
mr.
ely
shows
immediately
what
we've
got
in
this
little
area
up
here
that
i
can
cover
with
my
hand
is
mutually
exclusive
and
that
consequently
this
is
what
is
now
involved.
now
this
is
a
very
workable
thing,
you
see.
it's
a
very
easy
thing,
the
nature
of
the
resource
automatically
tells
anybody
that
this
is
what
is
about
to
happen.
now,
of
course
mr.
ely
argues
this
isn't
what
the
notice
was.
that
all
it
was,
was
that
this
is
like
a
illegal
process
which
were
not
–
this
isn't
really
illegal
process,
it's
the
process
of
developing
a
resource.
but
let's
for
the
moment
look
at
his
argument
which
is
a
technical
argument
on
notice,
it's
almost
black
letter
law,
that
a
person
who
asserts
a
right
--
be
on
the
ground
of
faulty
notice
has
got
to
come
in
and
show
at
least
three
things,
that
he
has
a
right
to
notice,
that
notice
was
given,
that
he
saw
that
notice,
that
he
relied
upon
that
notice
to
his
injury.
now,
it's
quite
evident
that
as
far
as
the
particular
petitioner
in
this
case
is
concerned,
no
one
of
those
requirements
can
be
met
because
wpp
--
the
supply
system
was
not
even
in
existence
in
1954
when
this
all
started.
when
it
came
into
existence
and
came
into
this
case,
the
claim
of
pacific
northwest
that
we
were
operating
under
--
our
preliminary
permit
was
abundantly
claimed
and
consequently
it
seems
to
me
that
as
far
as
the
supply
system
is
concerned,
they've
got
to
stand
or
fall
on
the
legal
effect
of
the
permit
that
was
granted
to
us.
they
have
no
technical
right
to
assert
notice.
but
let
us
even
pass
that
by
for
the
moment
and
assume
that
the
supply
system
can
stand
on
the
shoes
of
either
what
they
call
their
predecessors
and
interests
which
doesn't
really
do
them
much
good
because
their
predecessors
and
interests
were
not
construction
agencies.
they
obviously
were
not
agencies
that
had
the
capacity
to
start
so
that
--
they
had
no
interest
in
the
notice
or
even
--
or
leading
that
and
going
back
to
the
individual
public
utility
districts
of
which
they
are
composed.
let's
say
that
they
could
assert
faulty
notice
there.
now,
the
one
clear
thing
that
we
could
see
in
this
record
is
this.
if
any
public
util
--
if
any
qualified
public
agency
in
the
northwest
had
in
1954
any
ambitions
to
build
high
mountain
sheep
and
it
sat
back
as
mr.
ely
says
they
would
and
had
not
come
in
because
they
were
misled
by
this
notice,
what
would
have
happened
was
that
the
first
pleading
that
ever
came
into
this
case,
somebody
would
have
said
so.
we
would
have
had
some
evidence.
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
on
which
evidence
is
the
easiest
thing
to
produce,
the
most
persuasive,
of
the
most
easy
thing,
and
we
have
no
such
evidence
at
all.
there's
a
broad
generalized
statement
made
by
mr.
ely
where
he
says
they,
the
whole
area.
but
in
fact,
nobody
relied
on
this
and
we
all
know
that
they
didn't.
mr.
hugh
smith
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
hugh
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
mention
sedimentation
first
if
i
could
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
can't
give
you
any
record
citation
because
there
aren't
any,
but
i
think
that
because
it's
not
an
issue
of
the
case,
no
one
will
object
if
i
will
tell
you
the
story.
we
did
a
study
on
sedimentation
on
the
earlier
project
to
determine
whether
we
were
anticipating
a
problem
in
the
pleasant
valley
reservoir
that
would
affect
its
economic
value
over
the
life
of
the
license
or
the
probable
economic
life
of
the
project.
we
ran
this
out
to
100
years.
we
discovered
that
at
100
years
that
we
were
not
at
that
point
affecting
the
power
generation
of
the
storage
space
so
we
stopped
at
that
point.
now,
i
can't
really
say
to
you
there's
no
problem
but
at
100
years,
we
had
so
little
deposit
of
sediment
in
that
reservoir
that
it
was
completely
insignificant.
so
i
think
we
have
no
sedimentation
problem.
what
happens
on
the
snake
if
i
might
take
one
more
moment,
it
looks
awfully
dirty
when
you
look
at
it.
and
you'd
think
you
have
sedimentation.
actually,
that
river,
the
sediment
in
it,
so
called
sedimentary
is
so
finely
ground
up
that
it
runs
right
straight
through.
it
doesn't
fall
out
in
these
reservoirs.
the
other
thing
is
that
those
particles
that
do
fall
out,
there
are
as
you
probably
know,
mr.
justice,
a
great
number
of
reservoirs
upstream
in
this
area.
so
they
are
picking
this
up.
i
might
say
our
sedimentation
study
assumes
sedimentation
of
these
upper
reservoirs
up
to
a
100
period.
the
argument
that
mr.
ely
presents
to
you
--
what
i
think
be
a
very
persuasive
argument
if
we
were
dealing
here
with
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
hugh
smith
yes,
and
we
do
have
some
dams
of
that
sort.
i
might
say,
mr.
justice,
later
studies,
since
those
studies
have
indicated
that
was
a
little
bit
pessimistic.
even
150
years
is
pessimistic
and
not
that
most
of
those
projects
that
were
involved
in
that
would
probably
go
up
to
200
and
250,
which
point
that
gets
beyond
the
area
in
which
at
least
i'm
worried
about
it.
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
hugh
smith
i
know
of
it,
sir.
i
have
not
seen
it.
i'm
not
been
on
the
wanachi
but
i
know
of
the
dam.
i
know
of
the
situation
and
we
do
have
some
coastal
streams
also
where
the
sedimentation
question
is
substantial,
where
we're
going
to
--
some
of
those
will
fill
up
within
the
economic
life
of
the
project
and
they'll
then
operate
as
one
of
their
projects.
but
in
this
area,
it
doesn't
look
like
a
problem.
what
mr.
ely
has
presented
to
you
would
be
an
effective
argument
if
we
were
dealing
here
with
the
deed.
we
were
dealing
here
with
a
mineral
lease
under
the
minerals
laws
or
an
entry
of
any
sort
under
the
land
laws
of
the
united
states.
but
we're
not
dealing
with
the
deed
or
mineral
lease
or
an
entry.
we're
dealing
with
something
else.
i
think
it
is
used
of
something
like
the
mineral
leases
is
useful.
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
laws
that
give
you
any
protection
to
preliminary
exploration
that
you
make
before
you
locate
your
plant.
the
protection
that
you
get
is
after
you
locate
plants,
so
you're
at
the
risk
whatever
you
spend
to
decide
where
you're
likely
to
find
mineralization.
that's
the
specific
purpose
of
the
preliminary
permit,
however,
under
the
federal
power
act
is
to
give
you
protection
of
the
investment
that
you
are
making
when
you
go
out
to
see
if
you
can
find
a
project.
well,
that
investment
can
be
quite
heavy
and
our
problem
i
think,
the
split
between
us
here
is
that
mr.
ely
seeks
to
read
the
act
as
being
one
specifically
to
promote
public
ownership.
this
is
the
purpose
that
i
have
been
unable
to
perceive
either
in
the
language
of
the
act
or
any
part
of
the
congressional
history
nor
certainly
has
this
court
perceived
it
on
previous
occasions
when
it's
had
occasion
to
examine
the
provisions
of
the
federal
power
act.
instead,
this
court
has
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
encourage
investment,
the
private
capital.
now
i
think
we've
got
to
make
clear
when
we
say
private
capital
here
that
we're
including
public
capital
of
agency
such
as
mr.
ely's
clients.
this
is
non-federal
capital
when
we
say
private.
i
think
also
it's
clear
if
you
read
the
congressional
record
that
members
of
congress
did
not
consider
that
bodies
such
as
mr.
ely
represents
we're
going
to
be
a
significant
element
in
the
development
of
the
natural
resource
of
the
country.
and
that
they
in
fact
rather
expected
that
if
this
act
was
successful
in
encouraging
investment
of
capital,
it
would
be
successful
primarily
in
encouraging
what
is
normally
thought
of
as
private
company.
now,
if
there
is
preference
in
this
act,
the
other
problem
we
have
with
mr.
ely
is
that
he
thinks
this
is
a
problem
of
preference.
now,
we
do
not
regard
the
question
of
public
preference
and
the
policy
that
lies
behind
this
as
involved
in
this
case.
the
preference
in
the
federal
power
act
is
unequivocal.
there's
no
discretion
given
to
the
commission
as
to
whether
the
grant
or
denial
assuming
that
the
preference
applicant
isn't
otherwise
a
qualified
applicant.
incidentally
so,
i
don't
lose
this
point
towards
at
the
end
of
the
time,
it
should
be
clear,
we
deny
that
mr.
ely's
client
are
a
qualified
preference
applicant
for
a
number
of
reasons.
this
has
never
been
passed
upon
by
the
commission,
has
it
already
been
indicated
to
you
so
that
matter
is
not
actually
before
this
court.
but
if
there
is
a
qualified
applicant,
the
commission
has
absolutely
no
discretion
at
all.the
preference
applicant
gets
the
permit.
now,
mr.
ely
cited
to
you
in
his
main
brief
before
it,
series
of
statutes
which
he
referred
to
as
the
seamless
web
of
power
policy.
i
have
been
unable
to
weave
a
web
out
of
that
myself.
the
different
provisions
of
those
different
acts
all
which
have
to
do
with
marketing
--
federal
power,
doesn't
seemed
to
be
relevant,
go
off
in
various
directions.
there
are
different
emphases
upon
different
thing.
there's
one
thing
that's
rather
clear,
however
throughout
all
those
acts
they
specify
a
point
in
time
for
the
preferences
to
be
–
is
to
be
exercised,
and
that,
gentlemen,
is
the
whole
issue
of
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
congress
has
made
quite
clear
that
the
way
in
which
they
are
going
to
put
together
the
problem
of
encouraging
private
capital
to
come
in,
of
encouraging
them
to
spend
money
which
may
be
a
substantial
amount
of
money
to
go
out
and
explore
for
and
investigate
an
engineer
and
develop
a
project
that
will
be
best
adapted
to
a
comprehensive
plan
as
superlative
requirement
of
the
federal
power
act.
that
the
way
to
match
this
with
their
desire
to
accord
a
preference
to
those
rare
occasions
when
a
municipality,
a
city
might
want
to
build
is
to
say
to
the
city,
“come
in
before
the
private
company
has
spent
all
of
this
money”.
another
passages
that
we
cite
to
you
in
our
brief
from
the
congressional
history
in
this
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
merrill,
who
was
then
the
chief
engineer
of
the
forest
service
as
indicated
as
the
author
of
this
act
and
became
the
first
secretary
of
the
commission,
where
mr.
merrill
pointed
out
that
a
private
company
might
spend
even
as
much
as
a
$100,000
or
$200,000
on
going
in
to
explore
in
developing
a
project
and
then
it
would
be
quite
unfair,
quite
unfair
to
let
a
city
come
in
and
push
them
out
at
the
last
moment.
well,
this
is
the
issue.
this
is
--
depends
on
how
you're
going
to
regard
this
act.
if
you
start
off
looking
at
this
act
as
being
passed
and
adopted
by
congress
with
the
purpose
of
developing
a
resource,
in
other
words,
if
you
look
at
the
resource
we're
talking
about,
we
have
no
problems.
the
resource
we're
talking
about
comes
from
approximately
nez
perce
to
approximately
high
mountain
sheep.
it
can
be
done
by
engineering
structures.
we've
been
talking
about
three
of
them
as
though
there
are
only
three
alternatives,
actually
there
are
dozens
of
other
alternatives
up
there.
this
place
is
just
rightful
as
dam
sites
all
the
way.
but
it
can
be
done
anyway,
but
the
resource
that
we're
talking
about
is
that.
and
the
issue
that
we're
talking
about
or
that
we
were
talking
about
before
the
commission
is
not
really
exactly
how
you
develop
this
from
power
and
flood
control.
those
issues
were
well-defined.
they
were
how
important
this
fish.
from
the
very
first
government
report
that
we
have
on
record
which
incidentally
was
from
high
mountain
sheep
not
from
nez
perce,
this
is
a
report
of
the
district
engineer
in
1947
down
to
the
present.
the
issue
on
that
river
has
been
how
do
you
find
a
project
whereby
you
can
provide
all
of
the
public
purposes
that
we
have
available
here
and
still
get
adequate
protection
to
fish.
now
this
quickly
defined
itself
into
the
fact
that
either
you
build
below,
which
is
nez
perce,
there
are
three
or
four
sites
where
you
might
put
nez
perce
dam
depending
on
just
what
its
engineering
is.
or
you
build
above,
the
mouth
of
the
salmon
river.
now
the
reason
you
go
on
and
focus
on
the
salmon
is
that
this
is
the
enormous
spawning
stream
for
the
salmon
resource.
in
terms
of
relative
magnitude,
there
is
something
around
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
two
thirds
of
all
of
the
salmon
that
pass
the
mcnary
dam
come
up
to
the
nez
perce
project.
it's
about
200,000,
of
that
--
about
220,000
--
now
that
220,000,
about
180,000
turn
and
go
up
the
salmon
river.
about
25,000
used
to
go
up
the
snake
and
somewhere
between
5,000
and
9,000
go
up
the
imnaha.
now
that's
our
resource.
what
do
you
do
with
that?
obviously,
the
critical
one
is
the
salmon
river.
obviously,
the
critical
question
is
above
or
below
the
salmon
river?
now,
this
has
always
been
the
issue.
we
have
a
subsidiary
issue
because
you
can
--
you
got
several
places
above
the
salmon
river
which
in
turn
or
above
the
imnaha
river
which
are
all
called
“mountain
sheep”
in
various
variations
which
have
storage
in
various
variations.
we
have
the
one
that's
licensed
that
has
3,100,000
acre
feet
of
storage.
there's
a
high
mountain
sheep
site
right
above
the
mouth
of
the
imnaha
that
has
about
2,800,000
acre
feet
of
usable
storage.
then
there's
the
pleasant
valley,
then
there's
a
low
mountain
sheep
with
the
storage
in
that
case
--
pleasant
valley
that
had
about
500,000
acre
feet
of
storage.
alright,
these
are
the
problems.
we
got
a
preliminary
permit.
mr.
ely
says
that
we
make
some
choices,
that
we
make
some
exclusion
in
this.
all
we
did
was
that
we
follow
the
rules
of
the
commission.
same
rules
the
commission
has
had
ever
since
1922.
it
says
that
you
pick
out
a
project
and
describe
it.
it's
specific.
it
doesn't
say
that
we
can
come
in
and
then
list
the
alternatives.
it
says
a
project.
with
what
we
then
knew,
we
thought
mountain
sheep,
pleasant
valley
was
the
most
likely
frontrunner
and
we
described
that.
we
got
a
permit
that
said
that
we
proposed
to
build
a
project
in
the
snake
river.
this
was
the
definition
of
our
project.
a
project
located
on
the
snake
river,
in
the
counties
of
idaho
--
in
idaho
county,
idaho
and
wallowa
county,
oregon.
now
at
this
point,
the
question
is
what
did
we
have?
it's
not
a
question
of
retroactivity
or
anything
like
that.
the
question
is,
what
did
that
document
vest
us
with?
one
of
the
things
which
is
not
fully
irrelevant
here
is
what
did
we
understand?
we
did
not
understand
this
document
the
way
in
which
mr.
ely
now
professes
to
understand
it
because
we
didn't
confine
the
work
that
we
did
to
those
two
particular
projects.
we
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
examining
the
geology
of
the
high
dam
above
the
imnaha,
which
was
not
on
the
same
axis
at
all
as
the
mountain
sheep
dam
that
was
described
in
the
preliminary
permit.
we
found
that
it
was
geologically
imprudent
to
build
a
dam
there.
we
did
not
ignore
what
we
now
know
as
the
high
mountain
sheep
dam
and
we
so
testified.
we
gave
serious
consideration
on
whether
we
should
undertake
engineering
studies
of
the
dam
below
the
imnaha
and
we
concluded,
as
we
have
testified,
that
at
that
time
that
it
should
not
be
undertaken
because
of
the
interest
of
protecting
fish
in
the
imnaha
river.
i
should
know
the
commission
disagreed
with
us.
but
essentially,
we
find
out
they
are
during
our
permit
period
was
a
--
this
--
that
is
that
the
only
place
we
could
find
it
and
that
is
that
our
judgment
on
the
fish
was
not
the
one
that
was
going
to
prevail
in
the
public
interest
here
by
the
only
agency
that
can
make
it,
which
is
the
federal
power
commission.
so
having
explored
and
found
out
all
of
the
necessary
things
during
the
permit
period,
we
then
filed
exactly
what
the
statutory
plan
calls
for
his
to
file,
that
was
an
application
for
license
on
the
project
which
is
now
been
held
to
be
with
this
project.
i
must
make
a
few
further
points
very
quickly.
let
me
say
that
we
have
suddenly
faced
in
this
court
was
an
argument
by
mr.
ely
that
his
alleged
better
project
justifies
itself
a
reversal
and
a
remand.
now,
there's
been
very
little
said
about
this
argument
below
or
in
the
briefs
to
this
court
because
it
had
never
been
presented
as
being
a
subsidy
question
before.
i've
got
to
say
to
this
court
flatly
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
statement
is
wrong.
we
filed
two
different
designs
with
the
commission.
one
was
for
1,225,000
kilowatts,
the
larger
project
and
the
one
that's
finally
licensed.
the
other
was
for
875.
the
difference
is
between
those
or
in
peaking
not
in
energy
and
we
maintain
and
we
explain
to
the
commission
that
the
reason
was
that
for
a
temporary
period
of
time
of
about
five
years,
there
was
a
surplus
of
machine
capability
in
the
northwest
which
made
this
extra
400,000
kilowatts
of
peaking
of
no
significant
economic
value.
we
also
stated
that
we
would
propose
to
put
in
the
largest
--
that
we
had
taken
the
largest
projects
that
were
then
available
for
use
that
we
could
design
into
this
project,
that
would
be
supplying
to
us
by
the
generating
companies
as
of
the
time
that
is
on
it.
there
has
been
progress
in
the
art.
by
the
time
we
got
the
hearing,
wppss
had
a
larger
generator.
we
would
--
then
went
back
to
the
generating
companies
and
discovered
they
were
then
willing
to
put
in
even
a
larger
one.
figures
here
are
200,000
kilowatts
for
a
(inaudible),
the
one
that
we
found
that
were
larger
were
250,000.
the
court
may
be
interested
to
know
that
up
to
a
few
weeks
ago,
we
had
tended
--
we'll
settle
on
471,000
kilowatt
units
that
would
go
in
in
the
initial
installation
because
the
art
has
just
been
leaping
ahead
quickly.
it's
leaped
so
fast
that
even
a
few
weeks
ago,
we
went
back
to
our
engineering
company
and
told
them
to
restudy
this
in
view
of
the
announcement
of
the
600,000
units
that
would
go
into
grand
cooley.
now,
this
is
the
only
thing
that
is
similar
at
all
to
the
--
this
is
the
only
thing
that
it's
similar
at
all
to
the
design.
it's
been
provided
by
the
wppss
in
this
proceeding
is
the
size
of
the
image
because
the
initial
installation
is
our
plan,
the
ultimate
installation
is
our
plan.
mr.
ely
has
some
figures
that
he
may
give
you
on
rebuttal
that
would
--
seems
to
say
the
ultimate
installation
is
larger
but
this
isn't
quite
true
because
his
units
cannot
actually
produce
the
--
mr.
hugh
smith
no,
sir.
the
lower
canyon
project
is
part
of
what
is
known
as
the
high
mountain
sheep
plant
and
in
demonstrating
that
independent
of
fish,
the
high
mountain
sheep
project
was
better
than
nez
perce.
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
demonstrate
that
you
could
develop
the
salmon
river
with
a
--
with
an
economic
project.
now,
that
--
where
the
two
projects
would
be
better
than
nez
perce,
but
we
have
specifically
said
that
we
would
not
take
a
license
for
lower
canyon
until
and
if
the
fish
passage
problem
is
conclusively
solved
and
finally
solved.
mr.
hugh
smith
thank
you
very
much
sir.
mr.
hugh
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
solomon
has
struck
to
at
some
length
about
the
nature
and
condition
of
the
record
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
continue
it
with
just
one
further
point
of
consideration.
the
secretary
said
in
his
brief
that
it's
part
of
the
burden
of
proof
of
an
applicant
to
acquire
a
license
under
the
federal
power
act
that
the
applicant
demonstrate
that
he
will
produce
as
good
a
dam
as
the
federal
--
good
a
project
as
the
federal
project
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
advantages
of
federal
development
one
of
the
several
phraseologies
of
this
that
the
secretary
has
used
in
his
brief.
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
discuss
with
you
the
problem
that
is
presented
to
an
applicant
that
was
presented
to
me
in
preparing
and
presenting
this
case
to
the
commission.
we
were
perfectly
well
aware
of
section
7
(b)
as
mr.
solomon
told
you,
we
just
finished
the
case
in
which
that
was
the
major
argument
against
issuing
us
a
license,
we
thought
to
have
lost
it
on
another
ground.
and
we
--
we
had
made
the
case
at
that
time
relevant
to
the
problems
of
why
you
should
have
a
private
project
instead
of
a
public
private
and
we
prepared
this
case
because
we
thought
we
had
the
same
argument
all
over
again.
again,
we're
wrong.
it
turned
out
to
be
a
different
argument.
but
our
evidence
was
prepared
with
the
idea
in
mind
that
we
had
to
satisfy
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
federal
power
act
as
mr.
solomon
said
we
don't
have
a
label
on
it.
we
don't
any
place
say
now
we
are
testifying
the
7
(b)
here,
now,
were
testifying
section
10
(a).
but
certainly
we
knew
this
and
knowing
this
the
evidence
that
as
an
applicant
we
put
in
to
something
like
this.
we
produced
evidence,
this
is
engineering
testimony.
its
highly
technical
testimony
was
produced
through
a
--
a
witness
on
our
part
was
an
acknowledged
expert
in
this
field
that
project
was
designed
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
capable
of
producing
not
at
site
but
in
the
area
as
a
whole,
in
the
whole
columbia
river
basin,
the
maximum
amount
of
usable
power
over
the
life
of
the
project.
now,
this
apparently
is
conceded
by
the
secretary
that
we
have
designed
such
project
because
the
secretary
says
that
they
will
build
substantially
the
same
project
as
we
would
propose
to
build
if
they
got
the
recommendation.
now,
we
knew
we've
been
in
the
power
business
for
a
long,
long
time.
we've
helped
set
up
the
northwest
power
pool.
we
were
engaged
in
the
negotiations
for
the
coordination
agreement
while
we
were
before
the
commission.
we
knew
that
we
couldn't
get
that
maximum
amount
in
the
area
as
a
whole.
this
is
what
we're
calling
coordination.
unless
we
got
agreement
from
other
parties,
so
we
also
introduced
evidence,
well
let
me
first
say
that
in
our
license
application
itself,
we
stated,
that
we
had
designed
the
project
for
full
coordination.
and
we
stated
furthermore
in
the
application
itself
that
we
propose
to
operate
that
project
in
full
coordination
so
as
to
get
the
maximum
amount
of
power.
we,
therefore,
went
as
far
as
that
stage
as
we
could
to
commit
to
ourselves
to
the
operations
of
this
project
in
the
proper
manner.
we
produced
evidence
that
we
would
have
to
have
an
agreement
in
order
to
have
the
optimum
operation.
we
produced
evidence
which
is
in
the
form
of
expert
opinion
evidence
i
suppose
on
behalf
of
our
chairman
of
the
board
who
is
the
utility
executive
of
some
four
years
experienced
that
in
his
judgment
the
advantages
of
full
coordination
would
in
fact
bring
the
parties
in
the
northwest,
some
15
of
them
together
in
an
agreement
in
the
life
of
this
project.
as
mr.
solomon
point
out,
the
opposing
applicant
was
rather
less
sanguine
about
it.
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
or
at
the
end
of
the
case
the
opposing
applicant
came
right
around
to
our
view
and
as
the
events
demonstrate
our
judgment
was
correct
and
mr.
solomon
pointed
out
actually
it
came
a
little
bit
further.
now,
this
is
the
why
in
which
we
show
that
as
far
as
power
is
concerned
and
this
includes
not
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
secretary's
map
which
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
its
exceptions
to
examine
the
opinion
is
it
that
it's
rather
interesting
here
on
the
snake
river
but
at
least
out
of
the
columbia
river
basin.
and
after
all
down
about
here,
above
the
mcnary,
there's
a
little
stop
that
goes
on
with
the
rest
of
the
columbia
river.
and
until
you
get
the
entire
basin
in,
you
cannot
start
handling
the
problems
that
we're
talking
about
in
coordination.
the
differences
are
rather
significant.
i'll
come
to
this
in
a
moment.
but
our
evidence
on
coordination
was
intended
to
show
that
there
would
be
coordination
not
just
with
these
projects
but
with
the
entire
complex
systems
throughout
the
columbia
river
basin.
and
as
--
as
matters
of
eventuated
this
is
what
we're
going
to
have.
no
evidence
on
navigation,
well
our
evidence
on
flood
control
which
is
a
little
bit
more
significant
was
first
we
designed
that
project
with
the
necessary
facilities
reflected
through,
in
terms
of
facilities
this
is
the
question
of
size
of
the
turbines
and
the
installation
low
level
sluices
and
various
other
facilities
of
this
sort.
those
facilities
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
those
corps
of
engineers
wanted
this
particular
project.
we
said
we'd
operated
for
flood
control,
our
power
studies
reflected
operation
of
this
project,
the
flood
control
at
such
time
as
it
was
supposed
to
be
operated
for
flood
control.
and
that
was
put
into
the
record.
we
put
it
in
as
our
exhibit
because
we
thought
it
was
so
important
but
it
also
went
in
independently.
the
formal
statement
of
the
chief
of
the
corps
of
engineers
that
he
had
examined
our
plans
and
that
he
was
satisfied
that
this
project
under
license
to
us
would
provide
the
same
flood
control
as
would
a
project
designed
and
built
by
him.
now,
that's
part
of
the
record
evidence
on
which
the
commission
is
acting.
substantially,
the
same
thing
is
said
about
navigation.
and
actually
navigation
in
this
particular
project
is
practically
de
minimis,
it's
a
negative
benefit
you
--
you
--
until
the
downstream
dam
of
china
gardens
is
built
that
maintain
the
minimum
flows
in
the
river
not
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
navigation.
we
don't
have
navigation
benefit.
but
still
the
project
has
got
to
be
designed
to
operate
in
that
manner.
we
did
so,
we
include
that
in
our
power
studies
and
the
chief
of
the
corps
of
engineers
made
exactly
the
same
point
as
the
navigation.
now,
essentially,
we
have
done
exactly
on
every
one
of
these
other
public
purposes,
we
have
done
the
same
thing.
on
recreation
which
is
a
difficult
thing
to
--
to
--
you
can't
get
this
down
in
the
engineering
terms
like
you
do
on
these
others.
on
recreation
what
we
have
done
is
adopt
then,
i
think,
improve
on
the
plans
of
the
forest
service
which
is
the
agency
that
has
control
practically
all
of
the
government
land
for
all
practical
purposes
of
the
whole
reservoir
because
most
of
the
reservoir
area
is
government
land.
we
have
--
we
have
followed
those
plans.
we,
as
i
say,
i
think
we've
improved
on
them
somewhat.
on
fish,
good
heavens,
this
was
one
of
the
major
questions
before
the
commission.
there
was
evidence
not
only
by
us
but
by
everybody
as
to
what
had
to
be
done
about
fish,
what
the
problems
were,
how
they
were
best
handled.our
contribution
there
was
a
rather
unique
solution,
problem
of
the
imnaha
river
which
put
rather
briefly
and
therefore
somewhat
inaccurately
amounted
to
constructing
in
our
official
channel
of
the
imnaha
that
were
carried
around
the
dam
and
deposit
that
in
the
snake
river
border
of
the
dam.
now,
if
i
can
summarize,
what
we
presented
was
evidence
tended
to
prove
that
we
would
produce
the
project
designed
and
built
by
us
and
operated
by
us
would
produce
the
maximum
amount
of
power
in
the
area
as
a
whole,
usable
power.
and
that
we
propose
them
soon.
the
evidence
introduced
tended
to
show
that
we
would
produce
exactly
the
flood
control
of
the
federal
project
would
produce,
exactly
the
navigation
benefits
of
the
federal
project
would
produce,
that
would
we
--
we
would
do
as
well
if
not
better
for
fish
and
the
federal
government
would
do.
mr.
hugh
smith
the
description
of
the
entire
fish
facilities
was
a
little
bit
complicated
mr.
justice
potter.
there
will
be
fish
ladders
at
them
itself.
the
channel
extends
up
the
imnaha
river
from
the
dam
to
the
head
of
the
imnaha
river,
a
distance
--
the
channel
itself
will
be
about
15
miles.
the
actual
distance
on
the
imnaha
river
just
a
little
over
seven
miles
so
that
you
then
come
down
to
the
more
or
less
conventional
fish
ladder
although
it's
somewhat
unconventional
and
tight.
mr.
hugh
smith
well,
the
problem
is
both
ways
if
you
got
a
great
reservoir.
the
problem
is
to
keep
them
out
of
the
reservoir
basically
is
what
we
could
term
a
hitch.
mr.
hugh
smith
well,
we
can
keep
them
out
of
the
turbines.
the
river
problem
is
that
the
major
reservoir
creates
an
ecological
condition
and
that
the
fish
don't
know
what
to
do
with
going
in
either
direction.
so
you
have
to
keep
them
out
of
the
reservoir.
now,
we
keep
the
adults
out
by
diverting
them
into
this
channel.
the
fray
coming
down
are
rather
easy
to
handle
because
they're
small
and
we
install
what
is
known
as
revolving
fish
stream
which
is
a
fairly
conventional
piece
of
machinery
at
the
headwater
of
the
reservoir
on
the
imnaha
river
and
that
diverts
the
fish
in
--
back
into
the
channel.
the
-
the
little
fish,
the
baby
fish
coming
up.
and
by
that
means,
they
bypass
them
coming
down
also.
so
this
is
the
way
we
keep
them
out
of
the
reservoir
entirely.
now,
it
happens
because
this
is
a
very
short
arm.
you
can
do
something
about
this
and
the
imnaha
itself
while
a
very
beautiful
stream
has
at
flow,
it's
comparably
small
that
we
can
effectively
handle
this
kind
of
a
device.
it's
not
something
that
probably
could
be
used
any
place
else.
but
this
is
something
we
developed,
this
was
our
idea.
this
is
our
contribution
and
it
has
gone
so
far
that
we
have
as
the
court
knows
the
support
of
the
state
fish
and
game
agencies
of
the
three
states,
oregon,
washington
and
idaho.
well,
the
support
most
uniquely
of
all
of
the
--
the
wildlife
groups
in
the
--
in
the
area,
the
wildlife
federations
(inaudible)
linked
in
the
area
which
never
support
a
dam
at
all.
they're
always
against
all
dams.
but
they
have
supported
this
and
they're
here
before
this
court
in
support
of
us
in
our
position
both
to
the
government
and
to
the
licensee
--
to
the
opposing
petitioner
in
the
--
in
the
next
case.
now,
i
can
suggest
out
of
this
--
this
problem
that
with
all
of
this
proof
that
we
will
produce
the
maximum
power,
all
of
the
navigation,
all
of
the
flood
control,
that's
physically
possible
for
anybody
who
produce,
that
we
do
better
for
fish
than
the
government
would
do,
that
we're
going
to
do
exactly
what
ought
to
be
done
for
recreation,
did
better
or
best
whatever
that
is.
that
is
our
proof
but
secretary
says
to
this
court
that
that's
not
enough.
that
we
have
to
go
further,
that
we
have
a
burden
of
proving
something
else.
now,
what
is
that
something
else?
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
since
the
secretary
came
in
first
with
this
position
in
1962
in
every
single
filing
that
has
been
made
since
then,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
sign
of
--
of
any
indication
of
evidence
to
support
the
argument.
this
is
still
true
here.
mr.
hugh
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
saying
at
the
beginning
of
the
recess
that
for
a
period
of
time
since
1962
since
the
secretary
first
made
up
his
mind
that
he
thought
there
was
some
reason
for
federal
construction
of
high
mountain
sheep,
we
have
been
asking
what
that
reason
is
and
not
at
anytime
before
the
commission,
not
before
the
court
below
and
once
again
not
before
this
court
fave
we
heard
set
forth
any
indication
that
there
is
evidence
as
to
any
superiority
of
federal
construction
--
mr.
hugh
smith
i
know
there
isn't.
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
hugh
smith
mr.
justice
white,
the
commission
knows
there
isn't
on
the
same
basis
that
i
know
there
isn't.
and
that
is
that
we
know
what
is
possible
to
be
done
with
this
project.
we
know
about
the
downstream
projects,
we
know
how
to
run
a
power
system,
as
we
know
and
as
the
commission
knows.
we
know
what
is
involved
in
flood
control.
this
is
a
matter
that's
been
before
the
commission
many
times.
my
--
the
constituent
agency
companies
of
pacific
northwest
power
company
have
a
number
of
projects
that
are
operated
for
flood
control.
out
of
all
of
these
we
know
there
is
nothing
that
the
secretary
is
going
to
produce
because
as
i've
outlined
before,
we
have
designed
this
project
and
we
proposed
to
operate
it
for
the
maximum
physical
possibility
of
all
of
these
public
benefits.
now,
they
--
perhaps
there's
something
wrong
in
our
proof,
there
has
been
no
suggestion
by
the
secretary
at
any
time
that
there's
anything
wrong
in
our
proof.
perhaps,
obviously
if
there
were
contested
issue,.
the
commission
might
be
entitled
not
to
believe
our
proof
or
the
proof
of
the
opposing
applicant
or
the
proof
of
their
own
stand,
all
of
which
went
in
independently
or
the
material
and
information
in
technical
studies
of
the
corps
of
engineers.
mr.
hugh
smith
oh!
i
think
as
--
as
mr.
solomon
said
to
you
there
is
inherent
in
every
license
procedure
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
issue
of
potential
federal
construction
and
each
time
there's
a
license
i
think
it
is
the
duty
of
the
commission
to
consider
whether
there
is
any
reason
to
believe
within
their
knowledge
and
judgment
of
the
area
as
to
whether
there
is
an
advantage
for
federal
construction.
what
we're
saying
to
you
essentially
sir
is
that
in
the
hands
of
a
series
of
experts,
of
expert
witnesses,
of
engineers,
the
expert
examination
of
the
project
is
we
designed
it
and
proposed
and
operated
by
the
staff,
the
testimony
of
the
corps
of
engineers,
an
enormous
amount
of
experience
in
close
cooperation
and
coordination
in
this
area.
the
question
is
not
whether
this
should
be
examined
because
we
assert
firmly
it
was
examined.
it
was
examined
exhaustively.
we
assert
firmly
that
everything
that
was
necessary
to
an
intelligent
rational
decision
was
before
the
commission
on
this.
the
question,
i
think,
is
if
there
is
a
question
to
be
raised
at
all,
was
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
commission
should
go
forward?
did
the
commission
give
any
indication
in
its
opinion
that
it
felt
that
it
was
justified
in
acting
as
it
did
because
the
record
was
inadequate,
on
any
fair
reading
to
that
opinion
as
a
whole?
that
it
seems
to
me
comes
down
to
the
only
question
that
can
be
decided.
we're
not
an
issue
here
at
law.
we've
got
a
curious
issue
of
facts.
and
this
--
mr.
hugh
smith
well,
it
is.
mr.
hugh
smith
by
no
means,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
hugh
smith
section
7
(b)
says
that
if
in
the
judgment
of
the
commission,
development
of
water
resources
should
be
undertaken
by
the
united
states
itself.
mr.
hugh
smith
i
--
there
is
no
question
mr.
justice
black
that
there
can
very
well
be
instances
where
the
reason
for
considering
a
federal
construction
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
proof
in
this
case.
the
one
recommendation
that
has
been
made
by
commission
to
the
congress
illustrates
i
think
that
type
of
a
situation.
now,
this
involved
development
to
saint
lawrence
waterway
and
the
question
that
moves
the
commission
to
send
that
to
congress
was
that
they
felt
that
congress
should
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
a
single
governmental
entity
should
develop
that
waterway
because
of
the
relationship
with
canada
or
whether
it
could
be
developed
by
different
entities
one
or
more
under
license
to
the
commission.
mr.
hugh
smith
let
me
answer
the
question
partly
yes
sir.
there
is
no
question
that
the
issue
of
the
relationship
of
high
mountain
sheep
to
the
downstream
dams
was
a
valid
proper
one
for
the
secretary
to
raise
with
the
commission.
the
secretary
raised
that
--
mr.
hugh
smith
well
and
that
it
--
i'm
sorry
sir,
in
either
case
it
is
something
proper
for
the
commission
to
decide,
to
consider,
excuse
me.
mr.
hugh
smith
no,
they
don't
have
to
wait.
this
responsibility
is
not
in
the
secretary.
this
responsibility
is
in
the
commission
and
in
the
applicant.
as
the
secretary
says
--
mr.
hugh
smith
pardon
sir.
mr.
hugh
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
hugh
smith
this
is
the
secretary's
argument
mr.
justice
black,
not
mine.
this
argument
is
because
of
the
physical
relationship
--
mr.
hugh
smith
well,
it's
part
of
it.
this
argument
is
because
of
the
physical
relationship
of
this
project,
the
downstream
project
there
should
be
a
single
operator.
and
that
this
would
justify
federal
ownership.
this
is
a
--
a
completely
legitimate
point.
i
see
mr.
chief
justice
that
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
hugh
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
me,
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
notice
which
is
the
essential
nexus
of
the
argument
made
by
mr.
ely
in
this
particular
case.
in
accordance
with
the
statute
in
1955,
the
federal
power
commission
gave
notice
of
our
application
for
a
preliminary
permit.
and
the
question
that
mr.
ely
raises
is
what
at
that
point
happens.
now
whatever
that
notice
meant
to
anybody
or
to
mr.
ely
or
anyone
else,
there's
one
thing
quite
clear.
it
did
not
mean
that
we
were
going
to
build
the
project
described
in
that
notice
because
as
mr.
solomon
explained
to
you
at
some
length
yesterday
and
as
i've
commented,
this
is
the
one
thing
you
do
know,
and
that
experience
is
shown
that
everybody
involved
in
this
particular
activity
knows
that
it
is
so
unlikely
that
anything
is
going
to
come
up,
its
exactly
what's
describe.
anyone
reading
that
notice
knew
that
whatever
else
it
might
mean
it
did
not
mean
that
that
was
the
project
that
was
going
to
be
built.
now
we
say
that
the
notice
served
its
statutory
purpose.
and
that
is
that
there
had
been
set
in
motion
this
statutory
process
which
would
eventuate
in
a
project
best
adapted
to
a
comprehensive
plan
within
the
standards
of
section
10
(a).
and,
that
consequently
anyone
who
had
purposes
or
plans
or
ambitions
that
would
be
affected
by
that
eventuality
were
on
notice
that
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
come
in
and
take
the
obligation,
undertake
the
obligation
if
they
wished
to
assert
a
preference
to
undertake
the
obligation
to
carry
out
the
expirations
to
develop
the
particular
project.
now,
viewed
in
light
of
this
statutory
purpose,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
scope
that
the
commission
has
given
to
a
preliminary
permit
is
a
very
sensible
and
workable
rule.
because
what
the
commission
has
said
in
this
case
is
that
a
permit
applies
to
the
project
described,
to
any
project
that
is
mutually
exclusive
so
long
as
it
occupies
substantially
the
same
reach
of
the
river
and
substan
--
and
develops
substantially
the
same
head.
now
the
phrase
is
substantially
the
same,
are
concepts
that
are
very
familiar
to
lawyers,
something
that
violate
is
not
an
exact
rule.
it
is
something
that
lawyers
are
accustomed
to
apply.
reach
and
head
are
of
course
more
engineering
terms
but
they're
very
familiar
to
engineers,
and
the
engineers
are
the
people
who
are
involved
in
this
kind
of
a
thing
we're
talking
about.
and
it's
very
workable
to
them,
and
mutually
exclusive
as
something
that
anybody
even
the
layman
can
easily
see
once
they
look
at
the
map.
even
this
map
by
mr.
ely
shows
immediately
what
we've
got
in
this
little
area
up
here
that
i
can
cover
with
my
hand
is
mutually
exclusive
and
that
consequently
this
is
what
is
now
involved.
now
this
is
a
very
workable
thing,
you
see.
it's
a
very
easy
thing,
the
nature
of
the
resource
automatically
tells
anybody
that
this
is
what
is
about
to
happen.
now,
of
course
mr.
ely
argues
this
isn't
what
the
notice
was.
that
all
it
was,
was
that
this
is
like
a
illegal
process
which
were
not
–
this
isn't
really
illegal
process,
it's
the
process
of
developing
a
resource.
but
let's
for
the
moment
look
at
his
argument
which
is
a
technical
argument
on
notice,
it's
almost
black
letter
law,
that
a
person
who
asserts
a
right
--
be
on
the
ground
of
faulty
notice
has
got
to
come
in
and
show
at
least
three
things,
that
he
has
a
right
to
notice,
that
notice
was
given,
that
he
saw
that
notice,
that
he
relied
upon
that
notice
to
his
injury.
now,
it's
quite
evident
that
as
far
as
the
particular
petitioner
in
this
case
is
concerned,
no
one
of
those
requirements
can
be
met
because
wpp
--
the
supply
system
was
not
even
in
existence
in
1954
when
this
all
started.
when
it
came
into
existence
and
came
into
this
case,
the
claim
of
pacific
northwest
that
we
were
operating
under
--
our
preliminary
permit
was
abundantly
claimed
and
consequently
it
seems
to
me
that
as
far
as
the
supply
system
is
concerned,
they've
got
to
stand
or
fall
on
the
legal
effect
of
the
permit
that
was
granted
to
us.
they
have
no
technical
right
to
assert
notice.
but
let
us
even
pass
that
by
for
the
moment
and
assume
that
the
supply
system
can
stand
on
the
shoes
of
either
what
they
call
their
predecessors
and
interests
which
doesn't
really
do
them
much
good
because
their
predecessors
and
interests
were
not
construction
agencies.
they
obviously
were
not
agencies
that
had
the
capacity
to
start
so
that
--
they
had
no
interest
in
the
notice
or
even
--
or
leading
that
and
going
back
to
the
individual
public
utility
districts
of
which
they
are
composed.
let's
say
that
they
could
assert
faulty
notice
there.
now,
the
one
clear
thing
that
we
could
see
in
this
record
is
this.
if
any
public
util
--
if
any
qualified
public
agency
in
the
northwest
had
in
1954
any
ambitions
to
build
high
mountain
sheep
and
it
sat
back
as
mr.
ely
says
they
would
and
had
not
come
in
because
they
were
misled
by
this
notice,
what
would
have
happened
was
that
the
first
pleading
that
ever
came
into
this
case,
somebody
would
have
said
so.
we
would
have
had
some
evidence.
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
on
which
evidence
is
the
easiest
thing
to
produce,
the
most
persuasive,
of
the
most
easy
thing,
and
we
have
no
such
evidence
at
all.
there's
a
broad
generalized
statement
made
by
mr.
ely
where
he
says
they,
the
whole
area.
but
in
fact,
nobody
relied
on
this
and
we
all
know
that
they
didn't.
mr.
hugh
smith
thank
you
very
much.
