(inaudible)
justice
william

but
i
suppose
but
for
your
priority,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
for
your
priority,
it
would
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
nothing's
wrong
with
that,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
my
--
i
suppose
that
--
the
question
i
should've
put,
your
reliance
though
was
not
on
that.
your
reliance
is
on
your
preference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
dated
september
1965,
so
i
was
going
to
ask
later,
ask
what
the
1964
--
was
that
ever
before
the
examiner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps,
not
the
last
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps,
not
the
last
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
this
mean,
mr.
ely
that
if
it
goes
back
and
the
secretary
is
right,
that
even
you
win
on
your
priority
points,
you
may
lose
out
to
the
federal
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
good.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
call
it
the
imnaha?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
just
one
question.
where
does
the
case
in
which
the
commission
set
out
to
do
in
your
view
of
the
commission's
responsibility
to
do?
and
then
that's
the
secretary's
assistant
in
developing
the
facts
where
the
secretary
ought
to
respond
we're
not
interested.
the
secretary
has
no
interest
whatever
in
the
question
for
federal
operation.
what
then
is
the
responsibility
of
the
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
then
that
your
answer
to
the
argument
that
the
secretary
is
not
interested
by
--
didn't
press
for
the
federal
operations,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
immediate
need
for
a
power
in
this
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
it
could
get
to
looking
ahead
for
ten
years
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
it.
but
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reason
that
i
asked
this
question
is
that
there
--
i
happened
to
know
of
some
hydroelectric
projects
authorized
by
the
federal
government
for
which
there
was
no
foreseeable
need
for
power
in
10,
20,
30,
40,
50
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
--
they're
built
for
--
put
people
to
work
and
--
and
jazz
up
for
the
campaigns
of
the
congressman
soon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
no,
i
don't
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
--
this
is
pretty
a
remote
country
of
course.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
solomon,
what
was
the
--
i
mean
in
the
record
that
suppose
could
have
shown
that
no
recommendation
for
federal
development
in
the
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
that
mean?
there
was
no
recommendation
for
federal
development
in
the
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
does
not
connote
that
he
felt
that
that
closed
the
7
(b)
issue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
corps
of
engineers
testify?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
commission
followed
the
corps
recommendations
that
it
must
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
this
--
are
you
suggesting
now
that
criteria
can
take
off
the
government
or
commission's
judgment
whether
the
federal
--
federal
government
should
undertake
the
project
independently
one
of
the
other
sides
of
his
life
would
--
that
can
be
as
well
done
by
them,
the
system
or
the
federal
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
--
what
if
the
--
do
you
suggest
any
criteria?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
government
or
the
commission
prefers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
impressed
with
the
way
you
opened
it,
we
are
suggesting
that
on
some
of
these
matters
merely
because
in
the
branching
for
the
same
old
one,
it
would
be
easier
to
get
things
done
than
it
would
be
in
the
way
for
example
on
the
flood
control
and
of
course
in
condition
for
their
federal
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kind
--
what
kind
of
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
would
think
just
to
say
that
you
don't
need
the
expert
testimony
to
know
that
it
would
be
easier
for
the
power
commission
to
work
with
the
corps
of
engineers,
perhaps
it
would
--
corps
of
engineers
have
to
go
to
the
power
commission
compelled
towards
to
some
conditions
on
the
filing
of
its
license
but
an
expert
testimony
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
this
thing?
i
don't
recall
that
in
--
in
your
main
argument
you
made
any
reference
of
the
respects
the
federal
dams
below
to
this
agreement
that
--
that
mr.
smith
referred
us
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
other
than
that
i
gather
your
point
is
that
on
such
matters
as
flood
control
what
advantages
there
may
be
for
having
the
top
dame
in
the
same
--
under
the
same
operations
as
to
lower
dams
as
there's
no
way
affected
by
this
coordination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
claiborne
that
we
--
we'd
have
50
years
experience
under
7
(b)
now
and
foremost
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
none
when

whenever?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
saint
lawrence
seaway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
did
the
chapman
involved
or
something
close
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
by
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
saint
lawrence
case,
was
anything
written
to
indicate
that
the
commission
felt
it
was
a
criteria
which
required
the
determination
there
reached
federal
--
up
to
the
federal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
supposed
you're
--
supposed
we
had
the
right
--
where
the
purposes
of
7
(b)
the
criteria
to
guide
the
commission.
if
we
would
agree
with
you
and
send
this
back
to
amend
what
would
--
what
should
we
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
determine
for
itself
what?
is
it
because
there
is
a
visual
reaction
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
the
commission
that
--
that
it'd
be
better
federally
operated
at
private
effort?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
gather
you
concede
however
that
the
--
that
if
the
commission
had
--
if
the
company
applied
for
a
license
on
pleasant
valley,
that
they
would
have
had
priority
on
that
site?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
fact
that
they'd
been
granted
the
permit
would
give
them
a
priority
over
you
on
that
site?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
clearly
did
--
did
your
client
fight
for
a
permit
or
a
license
on
nez
perce?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
a
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
what
position
did
the
company
take
on
your
nez
perce
application,
i
take
it,
of
opposition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it
conflict
of
high
mountain
sheep?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
would
--
that
probably
didn't
come
to
ahead
until
(inaudible),
we're
losing
out
nez
perce,
went
for
high
mountain
sheep.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
their
position
would
be
if
this
were
nez
perce
rather
than
high
mountain
sheep
that
it
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
what

your
application
rejected
on

justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
justice
william

there's
