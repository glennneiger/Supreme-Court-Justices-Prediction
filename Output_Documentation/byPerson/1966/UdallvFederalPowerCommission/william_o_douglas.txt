justice
william
o.
douglas
how
far
up
or
down
can
he
go?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand
that
the
--
if
the
corps
of
engineers
has
on
file
plans
for
19
dams
on
the
middle
port
of
the
salmon.
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
it
cover
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
the
theory
then
of
your
regulations
that
permit
an
amendment
of
these
temporary
permits?
you
do
have
provisions
for
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
your
own
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
your
own
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
adopts
the
sedimentation
rate
in
this
snake
river?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
the
expected
life
of
one
of
these
dams,
ten
years,
twenty
years?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
--
that's
true.
i
know
it's
--
i
really
have
something
upon
that
on
the
situation
in
texas
the
other
day,
those
licenses
also
at
issue,
but
the
dams
lasts
about
10,
15,
20
years.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
think
it's
a
very
heavy
silt
river
too.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but,
the
reason
i
asked
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
reason
i
asked
because
i
--
i
happen
to
know
the
wanachi
dam.
it's
a
clear
water
stream
and
i
think
it
was
finished
--
well,
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
it's
all
silt
in
it
already.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
wonder,
mister
--
could
you
conveniently
gives
the
records
citation
to
this
sedimentation
problem?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
reason
i
asked
you
was,
i
want
to
continue
this.
the
reason
i
asked
you
is
some
of
our
earlier
cases
here,
all
that
began
15
years
ago.
the
engineers
were
predicting
that
the
life
of
these
is
around
a
150
years,
in
the
specific
northwest
area.
justice
william
o.
douglas
have
you
seen
the
dam
on
the
wanachi?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
the
lower
canyon
project
at
all
at
issue
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
arguing
both
cases?
justice
william
o.
douglas
462?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there's
a
brief
other
than
the
one
on
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
true
with
the
china
gardens?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
this
turn
on
the
--
on
a
fish
problem?
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
i
just
happened
to
know
this
river
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
government's
performance.
i'd
say
that
it
have
been
very,
very
destructive
of
fish
and
i
--
i
wondered
how
quite
this
is
so
loose
a
large
in
this
picture,
in
your
mind,
from
your
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
it
be
to
say
whoever
was
the
licensee?
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
that
would
depend
upon
the
design
of
the
dam,
wouldn't
it?
even
though
you
can
say
that
in
view
of
the
history
of
what's
happened
to
the
salmon
running
at
columbia.
to
look
at
these
dams,
they're
all
federal
dams,
nine
of
them,
and
we're
going
to
have
here
in
the
columbia,
the
same
thing
that
we
had
in
the
sacramento,
the
disappearance
of
the
salmon.
justice
william
o.
douglas
maybe
the
private
utility
can't
do
any
better
but
i
don't
see
how
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
corps
of
engineers
would
even
--
the
hero
on
the
big
black
horse
in
this
regard
and
officially
got
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
that's
true.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
it
is
now,
as
a
result
of
all
of
these
dams
but
i
used
to
find
the
salmon
way
up
--
way
up
to
some
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
no
one
can
grant
fully
that
there
had
no
fish
can
get
--
get
over
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
not
responsive
to
his
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
no,
no
--
not
at
this
--
not
at
this
site
though.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
or
not
it
should
be
built
here
or
at
the
nez
perce.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
don't
know
what
the
government's
position
on
this,
do
we?if
this
was
--
we
reverse
and
remand,
the
secretary
was
never
party
to
this.
he
got
to
put
in
an
evidence,
did
he?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
tied
it
in
the
roof
like
properly
for
abandonment
of
this
site
and
inspection
of
it,
can't
he?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand.
but
my
question
was
--
was
in
this
case,
in
case
your
arguments
whether
after
mr.
justice
black's
question
i
see
section
7
(a)
says
that
in
issuing
these
preliminary
permits,
preference
shall
be
given
to
applications
by
states
in
those
appellants.
there's
two,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
my
question
was
when
that
preliminary
permit
was
issued
in
this
case
where
the
--
was
their
a
contest
between
states
and
the
private
utility
or
municipalities
in
the
private
utility?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
he
resigned.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
one
covered
by
the
preliminary
permit.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
they
also
claimed
that
your
--
the
agency
or
group,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
doesn't
qualify
as
a
municipality.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
before
the
ninth
circuit
now,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
would
have
bear
upon
this
perhaps.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
far
up
or
down
can
he
go?
justice
william
