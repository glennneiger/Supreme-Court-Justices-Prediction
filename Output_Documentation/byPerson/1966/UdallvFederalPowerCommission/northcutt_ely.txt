mr.
northcutt
ely
may
it
please
the
court.
in
number
462,
we
are
concerned
also
with
the
high
mountain
sheep
project.
the
antagonist
here
however
are
the
washington
public
power
and
supply
system,
an
applicant
for
a
license,
a
public
agency
of
the
state
of
washington
in
a
municipality,
and
the
power
company.
the
washington
public
power
supply
system
is
composed
of
16
public
utility
districts
operating
in
its
many
counties
in
the
state
of
washington
and
the
serving
of
--
about
half
of
the
state's
population.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
dam
is
about
15
miles
upstream
from
the
washington
line
on
the
boundaries
between
idaho
and
oregon.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
sir.
the
state
of
idaho
asserts
that
it
has
the
power
to
veto
the
selection
by
the
federal
power
commission
of
this
public
agency
of
the
state
of
washington
as
a
licensee
and
we
denied
a
veto
power
of
the
state
of
idaho.
we
say
that
under
this
court's
decisions
in
the
tacoma
case
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
that
we
have
a
capacity
that
we
are
licensed
to
carry
out
all
of
the
terms
of
the
license
within
the
state
of
idaho
and
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
northcutt
ely
a
municipality
in
order
to
claim
the
preference
under
section
7
(a)
that
we
do
claim.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
so
held
in
the
court
below
and
so
held
by
the
commission
so
to
speak.
a
map
behind
me
shows
the
snake
river
in
this
area
as
mr.
claiborne
told
you
that
flows
north
toward
the
top
of
the
map
and
is
joined
by
two
major
tributaries
in
this
area.
the
salmon
--
i
mean
in
the
--
from
the
east,
the
imnaha
coming
in
from
the
west.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
this
municipality
is
or
is
not
entitled
to
a
preference
under
section
7
(a)
of
the
act
which
directs
that
the
commission
in
granting
permits
and
in
granting
licenses
for
a
no
preliminary
permit
has
been
issued,
shall
give
preference
to
the
application
of
a
state
or
a
municipality
and
it
goes
on
to
say
provided
that
the
plans
are
the
same
or
equally
well-adopted
or
may
shall
within
a
reasonable
time
to
be
fixed
by
the
commission
be
made
as
well-adopted
as
also
its
competitor.
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
proviso
of
the
section
7,
namely
the
opportunity
it
gives
us
to
make
our
plants
as
well
adopted
and
so
as
the
power
company
for
the
reason
that
the
power
that
the
plants
submitted
here
by
the
municipality
provided
a
power
installation
of
more
than
30%
larger
than
that
which
the
company
proposed.
and
while
the
commission
upon
its
initial
opinion
held
that
the
company's
plant,
this
smaller
plant,
was
vested
after
to
the
development
of
the
resource.
on
rehearing,
it
found
specifically
that
the
plan
exactly
as
we
had
proposed
for
the
larger
plant,
1,200,000
in
kilowatts
was
vested
after
and
substituted
that
description
but
licensed
the
plant
which
we
had
developed
to
the
company
solely
under
the
compulsion
of
a
permit,
a
permit
which
have
been
issued
to
the
company
as
chairman
swidler
said
in
his
dissent
for
the
investigation
of
an
entirely
different
project
upon
which
the
commission
itself
had
rejected
their
license
application.
the
primary
question
before
the
court
is
whether
this
permit
issued
for
the
investigation
of
another
project
indeed
was
intended
to
encompass
the
high
mountain
sheep
project.
may
i
have
the
red
overlay
here?
this
permit
has
the
following
background.
the
corps
of
engineers
starting
in
1947
and
down
to
1954
when
the
company
applied
for
this
permit
had
published
four
reports
on
the
power
potentialities
of
the
snake
river.
it
had
pointed
out
that
there
are
three
mutually
inconsistent
power
projects
for
the
development
of
this
reach
of
the
river.
the
three,
i
should
interrupt
to
say
that
neither
the
company,
nor
we
nor
the
secretary
can
claim
to
be
pioneers
or
discoverers
of
anything
in
this
area.
the
corps
of
engineers
had
fully
investigated,
drilled,
designed
projects,
all
the
ones
i
am
going
to
describe
and
all
that
we
are
doing
is
to
modify
and
improve
on
the
corps'
plans.
this
is
a
thoroughly
known
resource.
this
is
no
unknown
river.
the
three
plants
that
the
corps
had
proposed
which
are
mutually
exclusive,
we
provide
first
for
the
construction
of
a
dam
at
the
nez
perce
dam
site
which
would
impound
the
waters
of
both
the
salmon
and
of
the
snake.
these
are
great
rivers.
the
snake
flows
about
13
million
acre
feet.
the
salmon
about
8
--
about
a
22
million
acre-foot
resource.
this
is
substantially
larger
than
the
flow
of
the
colorado
river
(inaudible).
the
dam
in
nez
perce
would
impound
both
of
these
streams
and
would
be
the
best
place
for
a
power
dam.
beyond
doubt
any
single
dam
could
be
built
upon
the
stream.
it
had
the
great
disadvantage
of
blocking
the
salmon
river,
which
is
the
source
of
some
25%
or
more
of
all
the
salmon
on
the
columbia
river
system.
and
their
problem
was
whether
you
could
or
could
not
get
fish
over
a
high
dam
and
get
the
fingerlings
back
down.
the
next
report
or
the
next
project
that
the
court
reported
on
was
an
alternative,
which
was
to
build
a
dam
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
dam
site,
which
is
above
the
salmon
and
consequently
avoids
interference
with
the
fish
runs
on
the
salmon,
but
this
is
below
the
confluence
of
the
imnaha
which
is
itself
a
fish
stream
of
some
importance.
the
third
alternative
is
to
build
a
dam
at
the
pleasant
valley
dam
site,
which
is
far
or
less
attractive
than
the
other
two
but
does
have
the
advantage
and
it
avoids
both
the
imnaha
and
the
salmon
and
the
controversy
with
fisheries.
all
of
these
potentialities
have
one
limiting
factor.
that
is
an
elevation
of
1,510
feet
above
sea
level
is
about
the
maximum
that
you
can
raise
any
of
these
reservoirs
to
without
too
much
interference
with
the
hells
canyon
dam.
as
i
say,
these
three
mutually
inconsistent
potentialities
were
well-known
prior
to
1954
when
the
company
with
the
co-reports
before
it
the
latest
of
them
being
the
1954
report
as
suggested
the
pleasant
valley
scheme
decided
to
apply
for
a
permit.
now
the
choice
was
deliberate.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
you
are
parsing
the
terms
of
a
contract
to
the
--
to
discover
its
interpretation.
this
is
a
ticket
bought
for
a
specific
destination
and
not
--
and
for
none
other.
the
company
as
it
has
explained
in
a
document
filed
with
the
commission
in
the
licensee
proceedings
that
grew
out
of
this
pleasant
valley
application
deliberately
chose
this
project
to
avoid
trouble
with
the
fish
industry
on
the
salmon
and
imnaha
rivers.
the
statute
directs
that
upon
the
filing
of
an
application
for
a
preliminary
permit,
the
commission
before
acting
upon
that
application
shall
“at
once
give
notice
in
writing”
to
the
states
and
the
municipalities
likely
to
be
affected
by
it
and
shall
publics
--
publish
that
notice
in
the
counties
where
the
project
is
located.
the
reason
for
this,
as
a
legislative
history
develops
in
our
brief
so
amply
demonstrates
is
a
very
simple
one.
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
permit
upon
a
specific
project
nullifies
a
public
preference
upon
that
project
from
that
day
forward.
it
cannot
be
revived
at
the
licensing
stage.
if
a
permit
issues
and
if
the
project
is
within
the
--
encompass
of
the
permit,
the
public
preference
is
nullified
upon
that
particular
project
and
for
this
reason,
the
statute
and
the
commission's
regulations
are
very
specific
as
to
what
that
notice
shall
say.
they
require
the
--
that
the
notice
be
accompanied
by
a
map.
this
map
shall
show
the
project
boundaries
whether
or
not
public
lands
are
involved
and
if
public
lands
are
involved,
then
the
map
must
show
not
only
down
through
the
corner-to-corner
sections
but
to
10
acres
lots,
what
the
area
encompassed
by
the
project
boundaries
is.
the
company
applied
for
a
permit
and
attached
the
necessary
map.
the
map
deliberately
excluded
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
by
three
and
seven-tenths
miles.
it
avoided
the
armageddon
at
nez
perce
by
five
miles.
the
reservoir
boundaries
are
shown
in
red
upon
the
map
behind
me.
these
are
the
elevations
taken
for
the
two
dams
from
the
notice
given
pursuant
to
the
statute
by
the
commission
to
the
public
agencies
whose
preferences
might
be
affected.
these
are
reprinted
as
appendices
to
our
opening
brief,
a
public
notice.
the
application
has
been
specific.
the
map
has
been
specific.
and
the
commission's
notice
was
even
more
so.
it
tied
down
the
locations
of
the
dams
themselves
by
reference
to
the
public
land
surveys.
it
described
the
elevations
above
sea
level
as
i've
shown
them
on
this
map,
it
described
the
project
specifically.
this
was
not
an
application
for
a
general
permit
to
investigate
all
three
of
these
projects.
they
didn't
want
the
two
sticky
ones.
this
was
an
application
for
a
permit
to
investigate
the
more
bland,
upstream
one
--
the
pleasant
valley
one.
now
as
mr.
claiborne
has
told
you,
it
included
also
a
re-regulating
reservoir
at
mountain
sheep.
now,
mountain
sheep
dam
contributes
nothing
to
this
case
except
the
confusion,
the
names,
it
was
to
be
a
lower
dam
of
this
site
not
to
be
confused
with
this
--
with
the
site
we're
now
in
controversy
about
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
below
mountain
sheep
dam,
would
have
been
a
relatively
low
one,
the
major
dam
was
the
pleasant
valley
to
be
matched
against
nez
perce
and
high
mountain
sheep.
the
--
nobody
objected
to
the
issuance
of
that
permit.
the
public
agencies
as
commissioner
chairman
swidler
points
out
where
intensely
interested
and
anything
done
about
the
nez
perce
site
to
some
extent
about
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
but
nobody
wanted
this
inferior
pleasant
valley
site.
the
public
agencies
took
their
chance
that
the
commission
would
reject
the
license
upon
that
site.
the
commission
did
reject
the
license
on
it
in
1958.
the
--
if
i
may
interrupt
again
to
say
here
that
the
issue
i
must
keep
coming
back
to
is
whether
or
not
the
permit,
when
issued
in
1955
on
that
one
magic
day,
did
or
did
not
nullify
the
preference
within
not
only
within
the
red
area
shown
as
the
boundary
of
the
permit
but
outside
that
boundary
upon
any
and
all
potentially
competing
projects.
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
does
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
permit
for
a
specifically
described
project
with
specifically
limited
boundaries
so
defined
in
the
public
notice
automatically
give
the
permitee
some
extra
lateral
kind
of
a
privilege
upon
public
lands
and
navigable
waters
that
he
has
not
asked
for
and
has
not
modified
any
public
agency
claims?
did
or
did
not
this
notice
of
the
application
for
the
permit
put
the
public
agencies
upon
notice
that
if
this
permit
issued
for
the
project
shown
in
red,
it
would
automatically
terminate
the
preference
not
only
within
the
red
area
but
beyond
it.
now,
may
i
have
the
horizontal
line?
the
commission
in
1958
denied
a
license
application
upon
the
pleasant
valley
project
which
i've
just
described
the
areas
shown
in
red.
it
did
so
upon
the
ground
that
the
--
it
was
not
adequately
adopted
to
the
development
of
the
resource
that
to
any
project,
referring
to
the
same
corps
of
engineer's
reports
that
i've
mentioned,
that
any
project
which
excluded
nez
perce,
was
inferior
to
any
project
which
included
nez
perce
and
that
the
commission
entertained
great
confidence
that
the
fishery
problem
at
nez
perce
could
and
would
be
solved.
they
denied
the
application
for
a
license
therefore
upon
the
pleasant
valley.
the
company
applied
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
its
petition
said
that
it
wanted
additional
time.
it
had
only
less
than
a
month
to
go
before
the
three-year
term
of
its
permit
would
expire.
it
would
need
10
more
months
to
investigate
other
possibilities
that
it
pointed
out
to
the
commission
that
no
consideration
had
been
given
to
a
dam
at
--
on
a
site
between
the
salmon
and
the
imnaha.
that
is
the
very
site
we're
now
quarreling
about,
high
mountain
sheep.
and
it
wanted
adequate
time
to
investigate
to
that,
to
nez
perce
and
other
possibilities
and
that
it
made
the
point
that
by
denying
our
application
without
saying
something
about
the
priority
of
our
permit,
our
rights
may
be
lost.
we
want
assurance
that
our
permit
will
apply
to
the
new
project
we
hope
to
bring
before
you
in
10
months.
now
the
commission
has
denied
that
petition
for
rehearing
and
they
wrote
in
opinion
denying
it
after
the
application
which
is
now
before
the
court
was
filed
by
the
company
on
march
31.
on
march
31,
1958,
the
last
day
of
the
life
of
the
permits,
the
company
filed
the
application
which
are
--
you
now
have
before
you.
it
was
for
a
project
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
now,
it
is
quite
apparent
with
the
no
part
--
no
investigation
of
any
moment
had
been
made
of
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
within
the
three-year
term
of
the
permit.
we
have
in
volume
3
of
the
record,
29
maps
that
the
company
annexed
to
its
application
for
that
license,
the
license
now
before
you.
these
appear
beginning
at
page
883.
and
if
you'll
examine
these,
you
will
find
that
they
are
all
maps,
location
maps,
designs,
borings
of
sites,
relating
to
the
two
dams
that
are
just
been
rejected,
pleasant
valley
and
mountain
--
and
low
mountain
sheep.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
high
mountain
sheep
project
and
indeed
the
company
did
not
file
for
some
18
months,
the
application
which
is
truly
before
you,
one
with
the
designs,
plans,
specifications,
and
the
language
of
the
act
conforming
to
the
requirements
of
license
application.
now
in
the
meantime,
this
is
what
happened.
now,
i
may
say
that
not
until
19
months
have
gone
by
after
these
three-year
period
of
the
permit
did
the
commission
issue
the
license
of
section
4
(e)
of
the
act,
requires
it
to
give
again
to
public
agencies
upon
the
filing
of
a
license
application.
now
on
march
31,
1958
the
application
of
the
company
filed
and
completed
in
18
months
later
show
this.
this
map
shows
again,
in
the
area
in
red,
the
reservoir
elevations
of
the
original
notice
of
the
permit
application
to
us
given
in
1954
-1955.
the
area
above
the
pleasant
valley
is
not
greatly
different
because
the
reservoir
elevations
are
about
the
same.
this
map
shows
the
area
specifically
in
controversy
here.
the
area
in
red
is
the
permit
area,
the
permit
notice
area.
the
area
in
blue
is
the
additional
area
of
the
reservoirs
which
would
be
flooded
--
the
reservoir
which
would
be
flooded
by
the
high
mountain
sheep
dams
disclosed
for
the
first
time
in
the
license
application.
now
the
problem
is
whether
the
permit
or
the
area
in
red
and
more
specifically
the
notice
to
public
agencies,
the
applications
for
that
permit,
did
or
did
not
preempt
the
high
mountain
sheep
resource.
and
in
1955
therefore,
some
three
years
before
this
plan
was
first
disclosed,
did
it
or
did
it
not
kill
for
all
time
our
preference
right
upon
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
here,
we
reached
the
two
conflicting
philosophies
of
what
the
federal
power
act
is
intended
to
do.
we
say
that
the
dominant
purpose
of
the
act
is
the
development
of
the
nation's
waterways,
the
discovery
of
the
best
adopted
plans
to
do
so
and
the
direction
that
this
development
shall
be
carried
out
by
public
agencies,
preference
to
public
agencies
if
their
plans
are
as
well-adopted
as
those
offered
by
private
competitors.
here,
the
two
policies
are
converged.
we
say
that
the
preference
is
nullified
only
within
the
single
narrow
exception
that
the
act
points
out,
namely,
within
the
area
circumscribed
encompassed
by
a
preliminary
permit.
we
say
that,
given
a
case
in
which
we
presented
a
project
within
the
red
area
in
competition
with
the
project
proposed
by
the
company
within
the
red
area,
then
our
preference
would
prevail
still
if
our
project
were
superior
to
theirs.
but
we
don't
have
to
show
superiority.
but
if
the
permit
would
give
the
--
a
priority
to
the
company
within
the
red
area,
what
we
say
that
outside
of
the
red
area,
outside
the
area
encompassed
by
the
permit,
the
preference
to
public
agencies
remained
intact,
unscathed,
and
that
we
were
entitled
to
come
forward
with
a
project
for
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
relying
upon
our
preference,
totally
unaffected
by
any
priority
which
the
company
might
have
acquired
within
the
red
area
by
a
permit
to
that
red
area.
the
opposing
view
is
that
the
act
was
designed
to
promote
the
development
of
the
nation's
waterways
by
private
enterprise,
private
capital
that
its
purpose
was
to
protect
the
investment
of
the
entrepreneur
and
that
consequently
the
permitee
in
general
and
specifically
in
this
case,
is
--
has
not
only
the
right,
he
has
the
obligation
to
develop,
to
discover,
to
investigate
all
the
competing
mutually
exclusive
projects
affecting
the
same
reach
of
the
river.
and
that
therefore,
since
he
has
this
obligation,
he
has
this
right,
the
issuance
to
him
of
a
permit
for
a
single
and
inferior
site
here,
the
pleasant
valley
site,
gave
him
by
implication
of
law
a
permit,
a
right
to
occupy
the
nez
perce
site,
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
that
from
the
beginning
therefore,
our
preference
was
nullified
as
to
these
exterior
sites.
now
the
legislative
history
we
think
is
very
clear
that
this
sort
of
an
option
was
never
conferred
by
the
statute
upon
a
permitee.
this
would
be
a
truly
remarkable
public
resource
statute.
if
an
applicant
who
is
required
to
describe
by
metes
and
bounds
reference
to
the
public
land
surveys,
the
lands,
the
dam
sites
that
he
wants
to
occupy
and
upon
which
he
demands
a
priority,
somehow
got
from
the
united
states
a
right
greater
than
any
asked
for
and
greater
than
was
described
in
the
grant
giving.
it
would
be
a
remarkable
thing
if
congress
have
been
carefully
spelled
out
the
preference
for
public
power
in
the
statute
and
given
only
one
exception
to
that
preference,
namely
where
a
permit
had
been
issued
intended
by
application
to
give
a
permitee
a
right
to
paralyze
a
public
preference
upon
any
site
where
he
elected
to
transfer
his
option.
at
the
end
of
the
three
years,
mind
you,
at
the
end
of
the
three
years
and
not
at
the
beginning
when
he
makes
this
election
and
gives
his
notice.
we
think
that
chairman
swidler's
characterization
of
the
majority
of
the
commission's
construction
of
the
act
is
unanswerable.
he
says
that
he
declines
the
act
(inaudible)
in
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
that
unfair
that
the
notice
given
us
in
1954
or
1955
of
the
limited
scope
for
this
permit,
we
were
entitled
to
believe.
and
since
the
statute
and
the
act
of
the
commission
made
it
specific,
it
was
indeed
specific
that
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
can
or
cannot
grant
an
indefinite
permit
to
investigate
all
the
sites
on
the
great
stretch
of
the
river.
it's
--
is
to
simply
limit
this,
the
permit
here.
this
was
definite.
now,
the
legislative
history
also
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
that
this
preference
might
be
asserted
either
at
the
permit
stage
when
the
permit
is
issued
or
asserted
at
the
licensing
stage.
that
a
public
agency
is
not
bound,
slow
moving
as
these
political
bodies
are
is
not
bound
to
guess
when
it
receives
a
notice
describing
one
project
that
a
priority
may
be
claimed
displacing
the
preference
on
an
entirely
different
project
and
therefore
at
its
peril
come
in
and
apply
for
a
permit
on
that
same
project
or
a
competing
project
at
the
permit
stage.
the
legislative
history
shows
the
recognition
that
these
public
agencies
moved
slowly
and
they
must
have
an
opportunity
at
a
later
time.
now
the
argument
made
against
this
is
really
circular.
it's
that
it
goes
like
this.
that
since
the
permitee
has
the
obligation
to
investigate
all
competing
sites
to
discover
which
was
the
best-adopted,
to
develop
the
resource,
therefore,
his
permit
must
be
given
an
elastic
set
of
rubber
boundaries
to
encompass
everything
that
might
be
better
than
--
that
he
selected
in
the
first
place
and
that
therefore
the
notice
he
gave
to
public
agencies
must
be
similarly
elongated
and
that
the
application
itself
must
be
stretched
in
this
way.
now
this
procrustean
theory
of
the
operation
of
a
federal
grant
of
an
interest
in
this
precious
resource
is
a
noble
construction
of
the
statute,
particularly
where
it
is
used
as
a
device
to
nullify,
to
kill-off
a
major
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
recognition
of
the
public
preference
in
areas
other
than
those
encompassed
by
the
permit
itself.
the
--
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
we're
not
truly
concerned
here
with
the
question
of
parsing
the
words,
the
nouns
and
verbs
of
the
permit
of
the
application
and
the
notice
because
the
company's
own
petition
for
rehearing
and
its
supporting
documents
in
the
pleasant
valley
case
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
weren't
buying
any
ticket
on
the
--
to
the
high
mountain
sheep
or
nez
perce
sites.
they
wanted
to
avoid
those
destinations
and
it
would
be
only
inadvertence
if
we
now
find
in
the
permit
that's
so
carefully
excluded
them
language
which
now
includes
what
was
then
excluded.
but
because
they
do
make
such
a
point,
that
the
permit
on
its
face
was
intended
to
include
these
other
two
sites,
we
have
in
our
briefs
spelled
this
out
to
some
care,
the
--
especially
in
our
reply
brief
and
we
find
that
this
specific
project
is
defined,
it's
referred
to
and
named
21
times
the
two
sites,
the
pleasant
valley
and
low
mountain
sheep
are
defined
and
referred
to
five
times,
not
once
as
to
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
referred
to,
not
once
as
nez
perce
referred
to.
the
map,
the
only
map
we're
entitled
to
rely
on
deliberately
excludes
these
two
sites.
and
how
else
would
you
exclude
them
more
explicitly
unless
the
commission
put
it
--
the
foot
of
the
permit,
we
really
mean
this.
a
word
or
two
about
the
equities
involved
here.
the
company
has
--
and
the
commission,
make
much
of
the
fact
that
the
power
company
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
in
investigating
--
first,
the
pleasant
valley
project
and
now,
high
mountain
sheep
and
this
is
true.
its
testimony
shows
that
it
spent
some
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
in
working
up
its
plans
for
the
pleasant
valley
site
which
the
power
commission
found
was
inferior.
following
the
decision
of
the
power
commission
saying
that
nez
perce
was
the
best
site,
both
the
company
and
ourselves
spent
a
great
deal
of
money.
we
relied
upon
the
commission's
determination,
the
finding
to
that
effect
and
filed
an
application
for
a
license
on
nez
perce
and
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
on
it
to
discover
as
the
trial
went
along
that
the
fish
problems
did
indeed
seem
to
be
insurmountable
for
the
immediate
future.
although
we
had
put
into
our
nez
perce
plans
some
33
million
dollars
of
proposed
investment
as
we
take
care
of
fish
and
the
most
modern
devices
as
any
experts
could
think
of.
so
we
transferred
--
we
have
moved
to
substitute
high
mountain
sheep
ourselves.
we
both
got
through
it
the
hard
way.
now,
it's
true
one
or
the
other
of
this
is
going
to
lose
several
million
of
investment
in
planning
projects
if
the
other
gets
the
license.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
a
criteria
of
the
statute,
the
fact
that
the
company
spent
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
to
investigate
a
project
that
the
commission
rejected,
pleasant
valley
doesn't
necessarily
give
it
a
first
right
upon
the
next
project.
the
fact
that
we
spent
money
on
a
project
now
abandoned,
nez
perce,
we
don't
claim
gives
us
an
equity
or
first
right
on
the
nez
perce
either.
we
rely
upon
the
statutory
of
preference
to
public
agencies.
now
it's
an
ironic
fact
that
the
project
which
the
company
first
proposed
for
high
mountain
sheep
after
the
rejection
of
pleasant
valley
would
have
provided
less,
install
capacity
less,
capability
in
kilowatts
and
less
production
of
energy
in
kilowatt
hours
than
the
pleasant
valley
project
that
the
commission
had
just
rejected.
its
only
virtue
was
that
it
provided
for
ultimate
installation
which
would
have
been
larger
than
the
rejected
project.
and
our
project
is,
as
i
said,
some
37%
larger
than
the
--
than
that
proposed
by
the
company
for
this
same
site.
so
that
--
i
do
not
think
the
equities
bear
against
us.
now,
as
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
on
the
original
opinion,
the
commission
approved
the
smaller
project
proposed
by
the
company,
875,000
kilowatts.
we
had
proposed
a
1,200,000
kilowatt
plant.
on
rehearing,
the
commission
found
that
the
larger
plant
was
“best
adapted”
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
in
the
language
of
section
10
(a)
--
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
best-adapted,
best
adapted
to
the
development
of
the
resource
as
the
commission
said,
under
the
criteria
of
section
10
(a).
but
it
licensed
the
larger
plant
which
the
company
had
never
proposed
and
which
we
had
designed.
it
licensed
that
plant
to
the
company
on
the
ground
that
its
priority
gave
it
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
that
this
was
a
plan
best-adapted
for
that
site,
the
company
is
entitled
with.
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
except
that
--
but
for
public
powers
coming
in
to
this
picture.
mr.
northcutt
ely
this
project
--
this
magnificent
site
would
be
underdeveloped.
mr.
northcutt
ely
preference.
you're
quite
correct
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
your
honor.
yes.
if
we
had
never
come
into
the
picture
and
if
the
commission
on
its
own
motion
had
discovered
that
1,200,000
kilowatts
was
best,
it
should
have
demanded
the
company
to
build
it.
that's
correct.
now,
with
respect
to
the
government's
case
or
the
solicitor
general's
that
you've
heard,
our
strong
belief
is
that
both
of
these
cases
should
be
reversed
and
remanded.
the
secretary's
case
and
ours
as
the
commission
has
said
are
inextricably
entwined.
we
propose
a
project
which
would
pour
its
entire
output
into
the
bonneville
system.
we
were
going
to
build
transmission
lines
from
this
plant
to
connect
with
bonneville.
we
proposed
that
the
plant
be
integrated
into
the
bonneville
system,
the
power
dispatched
by
the
united
states.
we
believe
that
the
criterion
that
is
written
into
the
water
canyon
project
act
that
the
secretary
shall
control
all
water
passing
the
dam
for
all
purposes
is
in
the
public
interest.
there
is
more
to
the
integration
of
this
resource
than
simply
an
agreement
among
companies
if
they'll
somehow
trade
power.
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me?
the
coordination
agreement?
mr.
northcutt
ely
this
was
--
i
cannot
give
you
the
specific
dates.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
the
--
go
ahead,
mr.
solomon.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
feel
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
feel,
your
honor,
that
if
the
commission
has
another
opportunity
to
act
upon
a
fresh
record
instead
of
a
stale
one,
it
is
bound
to
reach
a
better
result.
if
that
should
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
if
the
commission
on
its
wisdom
should
decide
on
a
new
and
fresh
record
that
the
project
should
be
built
by
the
united
states,
i
think
you
would
find
the
washington
public
power
supply
system
actively
supporting
the
legislation
to
do
that
and
i'm
sure
you'd
find
the
power
company
actively
opposing
it.
thus,
it
would
have
a
right
to
do.
i
think
what
is
more
probable,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so,
is
that
on
a
fresh
record
with
the
information
before
the
commission
of
the
great
pacific
intertie
with
the
southern
california,
with
the
canadian
entitlement
power
coming
in
with
the
projection
of
a
load
that
was
not
before
the
commission
then,
that
time,
the
secretary
as
mr.
solomon
said
was
urging
the
commission,
the
power
is
not
needed.
today,
the
reverse
is
true,
that
the
--
a
new
record
will
show
that
a
million
kilowatts
a
year
of
atomic
energy
plants
are
being
planned
for
the
northwest
because
hydro
won't
be
enough.
this
supply
system
has
built
and
is
operating
the
greatest
nuclear
power
plant
in
the
united
states,
800,000
kilowatts
in
partnership
with
bonneville
as
far
goes
into
the
bonneville
system.
and
we
think
that
given
opportunity,
the
commission
can
certainly
find
a
better
solution,
one
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act
then
dedicating
this
resource
to
exclusively
to
the
benefit
of
this
company.
and
consequently,
we
don't
think
that
necessarily,
it's
a
question
of
federal
power
versus
public
ownership,
local
public
ownership
or
federal
power
versus
entirely
against
a
private
company.
the
difficulty
with
this
case
is
that
it's
been
decided
upon
a
--
an
inadequate
record,
we
think
the
secretary's
right
in
his
objections
to
it
and
by
a
--
totally
ignoring
the
statutory
preference
to
public
agencies.
the
fact
is,
you'll
find
great
difficulty
in
discovering
in
this
record
the
public
power
application
for
a
license.
the
examiner
for
high
mountain
sheep,
the
examiner
denied
our
application
to
amend
our
nez
perce
application
to
substitute
high
mountain
sheep.
the
commission
overruled
it
--
reversed
it.
but
in
his
report
to
the
commission,
he
adhered
to
this.
he
said
the
amendments
should
not
be
allowed.
the
commission
in
its
final
opinion
reversed
them
again.
but
in
the
opinion,
it
granted
the
license
to
our
competitor
a
little
late
to
do
us
very
much
good.
what
we
were
committed
to
do
is
to
put
in,
in
bits
and
pieces
in
rebuttal
to
the
company's
case
our
objection
to
this
feature
of
their
project,
to
that
feature,
it
should
be
bigger,
a
1,200,000
kilowatts,
should
have
a
different
design.
and
our
rebuttal
evidence
scattered
to
the
record
is
all
we
have
to
point
to
as
an
application
because
the
examiner
excluded
it.
now,
we
think
upon
our
fresh
record
a
better
and
more
fair
result
will
be
obtained
and
one
more
to
the
public
interest.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
northcutt
ely
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
shall
not
have
time
to
cover
all
of
the
points
that
i
would
like
to
--
remaining,
now
i
should
like
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me,
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
had
our
application
for
a
license
on
the
high
mountain
sheep
been
granted?
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
would
have
excluded
the
granting
of
a
license
to
the
company
for
any
project
in
conflict
with
ours.
mr.
northcutt
ely
they
were
applying
for
exactly
the
same
site,
your
honor,
high
mountain
sheep.
if
you're
referring
to
the
earlier
context
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
in
which
the
–-
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
preliminary
permit,
we
did
not
have
a
preliminary
permit,
our
opponents
did.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
they
had
built
a
project,
had
the
commission
licensed
the
project
at
pleasant
valley,
the
high
dam
there,
this
would
have
been
in
conflict
with
the
--
any
project
that
high
mountain
sheep
or
nez
perce
and
it
would've
been
physically
impossible
thereafter
build
a
project
to
either
of
those
places,
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
why
should
one
application
be
exclusive
of
the
other
one?
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
statute
your
honor
in
section
7
(a),
directs
that
in
the
event
of
conflicting
applications
preference
shall
be
given
to
the
application
of
a
mini
state
or
a
municipality.
the
company
relies
upon
the
single
exception
to
that
preference
which
is
--
makes
the
preference
inoperative
where
a
preliminary
permit
has
been
issued.
they
will
--
they
say
that
the
permit
which
was
granted
to
them
for
the
pleasant
valley
project
shown
in
red
on
the
map
behind
me
gave
a
priority
which
displaced
an
old
--
our
preference
upon
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
upon
the
nez
perce
site
as
well
as
upon
the
sites
encompassed
by
the
permit.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
not
in
the
case
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
commission
below
declined
to
agree
with
them
this
--
the
commission
and
the
court
below
both
had
specifically
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
the
issue
before
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
whether
we
are
a
municipality.
the
issue
before
the
ninth
circuit
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
district
judge
to
the
effect
that
we
were
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
idaho
and
oregon,
not
upon
our
status
under
washington
law.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
if
that
question
is
ever
--
that
question
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
taken
off
the
docket
awaiting
the
decision
upon
this
review
of
the
commission's
decision.
now
on
remand
if
the
commission
decides
if
this
is
an
issue
which
contrary
to
this
court's
holdings
in
the
first
iowa
case
or
in
the
tacoma
case
does
mean
that
a
state
can
veto
a
federal
licensee,
done
that
as
a
matter
for
another
day
in
litigation.
it
is
not
right
for
litigation
now.
your
honor,
we
offered
a
--
pardon,
i
may
say
at
the
outset
that
we
claim
a
preference
which
the
court
below
said
was
clearly
applicable
in
the
absence
of
a
preliminary
permit.
we
have
offered
in
our
briefs
two
reasons
why
this
permit
is
not
applicable
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
one
is
the
reason
i
have
argued,
the
major
reason
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
by
the
language
of
the
permit,
it
never
did
apply
to
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
but
we
also
point
out
in
our
briefs
which
i
do
not
have
time
to
argue,
that
if
this
particular
permit
would
encompass
this
particular
site,
the
permit
was
a
dead
permit
by
the
time
the
license
application
was
filed.
and
i
should
like
to
simply
refer
to
the
points
in
the
brief
--
briefs
where
that
point
is
discussed.
this
is
point
number
eight
in
our
opening
brief,
beginning
at
page
53
where
we
give
in
some
detail
a
sequence
--
in
events
the
citations
of
the
record
and
is
covered
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
48
and
50.
pardon
me,
yesterday
mr.
solomon
indicated
--
they
told
the
court
quite
candidly
that
the
permit
did
indeed
as
a
matter
of
law
encompassed
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
the
nez
perce
site
--
may
i
have
the
blue
overlay.
the
permit
is
indicated
in
red
on
this
map,
these
are
the
areas
shown
in
the
notice
and
upon
the
face
of
a
permit.
what
you're
about
to
see
is
a
reproduction
of
the
information
on
the
maps
opposite
page
3
of
our
opening
brief.
and
this
shows
the
legal
consequences
of
mr.
solomon's
assertion
yesterday.
if
indeed
the
issuance
of
a
permit
in
1955
for
the
area
shown
in
red
mainly
for
the
low
mountain
sheep
and
pleasant
valley
dam
sites
did
as
a
matter
of
law
give
this
permitee
the
option,
the
right
to
transfer
this
priority
to
annul
as
of
the
date
of
issuance
of
that
permit.
the
high
mountain
sheep
and
the
nez
perce
da
--
site,
then
these
were
the
consequences
from
the
day
that
permit
issued
in
1955
describing
as
i
would
show
in
a
moment
by
metes
and
bounds
and
records
of
public
land
surveys
only
the
area
in
red.
the
permitee
got
without
ever
asking
for
it,
without
ever
giving
notice
to
anyone
and
without
the
permit
saying
--
so
on
its
face
these
rights,
the
exclusive
right
of
occupancy
for
three
years,
for
three
years
of
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
nez
perce
to
the
effect
that
he
got
the
exclusive
right
from
the
imnaha
river
and
the
exclusive
right
upon
the
salmon
river
up
to
the
freedom
dam
site,
these
are
the
areas
that
would
have
been
flooded
by
the
nez
perce
dam.
now
then
this
disclosure
of
the
permitee's
claim
was
not
made
until
the
last
day
the
three
years
of
the
permit.
on
the
day
it
expired,
he
filed
this
license
application
which
for
the
first
time,
disclosed
that
he
claimed
the
priority
for
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
we
are
now
told
and
that
as
a
candidate,
in
proper
admission
by
mr.
solomon
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
also
encompassed
the
nez
perce
dam
site,
it
didn't
encompass
high
mountain
sheep.
now
the
problem
is
transposing
this
issue
to
alaska
or
any
other
unknown
rivers
does
a
granting
of
a
permit
strictly
limited
to
a
specific
site,
give
the
permitee
that
kind
of
an
option.
no
one
can
know
from
reading
the
permit,
reading
the
application,
reading
the
map
that
a
company's
permit,
what
is
encompassed
by
that
permit?
yesterday
mr.
chief
justice
warren
asked
a
question
that
i
don't
think
was
answered
and
referring
to
the
dams
on
the
cascade
map
of
the
government.
this
i
believe
is
at
page
525
of
the
record
in
volume
2.
and
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
if
a
permit
had
been
issued
for
one
of
the
nine
dams
that
are
federal
dams
as
it
happens.
the
downstream
from
high
mountain
sheep
whether
the
permitee
would
have
got
the
option,
an
exclusive
right
on
all
nine,
the
answer
mr.
chief
justice
says
yes.
the
answer
however
depends
with
this
qualification
upon
the
permitee's
ingenuity,
engineering
ingenuity
in
designing
a
dam.
if
you'll
pick
out
again,
assume
we
transpose
this
problem
to
alaska,
the
yukon,
or
wherever
you
like,
we're
dealing
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
to
keep
these
names
of
dams
for
easy
identification
and
pick
out
the
fits,
the
middle
dam
of
the
nine.
if
we
refer
to
this
map,
then
this
means
that
a
permitee
for
that
dam
automatically
got
a
preemptive
option,
a
right
which
displace
the
public
preference
on
the
number
one
dam
upstream
even
though
his
plans,
his
designs,
his
notice
didn't
show
any
interference
because
of
the
relative
heights
of
the
dams,
because
he
read
the
right
to
increase
the
height
of
his
dam.
this
was
a
minor
modification,
a
right
that
needed
no
amendment
according
to
the
power
commission
council.
similarly
he
had
an
exclusive
option
upon
the
downstream
dams
even
though
if
you
look
at
the
map
at
page
525,
the
government's
cascade
series
of
maps.
it
would
appear
that
the
dams
downstream
could
have
no
interference,
no
relationships
to
the
middle
dam.
this
is
because
the
permitee
if
he
comes
in
and
says
“no,
i
have
found
a
way
to
build
a
dam
at
the
downstream
site,
site
number
nine,
downstream,
three
times
the
height
that
anyone
else
had
thought
of.
my
engineering
is
better.
i've
drilled
the
foundations.
then
that
dam
will
--
would
indeed
have
interfered
with
the
one
that
i
named
in
my
permit
then
because
they
are
mutually
exclusive,
because
they
would
interfere
with
each
other.
i
got
the
option
upon
that
downstream
site
too.
now
this
is
a
strange
way
to
interpret
a
right
in
a
navigable
stream.
mr.
solomon
said
yesterday
that
the
requirements
of
a
specificity
and
application
for
a
permit,
and
the
permit
itself
do
mean
that
you
must
apply
for
a
specific
project
and
you
must
describe
it.
but
the
reason
says
he
is
that
this
--
the
congress
was
concerned
about
excessive
land
withdrawals
under
section
24.
now,
mechanically
under
the
regulations,
the
withdrawal
under
section
24
as
established
by
the
commission
sending
to
the
secretary
of
interior
a
copy
of
its
notice
that
it
gave
to
public
agencies,
the
one
notice
handed
to
the
secretary
effects
ipso
facto,
a
withdrawal
of
the
public
lands
affected
by
that
project,
a
rare
instance
where
an
individual
by
filing
an
application
withdraws
the
lands
for
his
private
benefit.
the
carbon
copy
of
the
same
notice
sent
to
the
public
agencies
and
published
in
the
counties
where
the
project
lies,
do
not
have
this
effect
according
to
the
counsel
for
the
commission.
the
lands
that
are
covered
by
the
notice
of
the
secretary
are
indeed
withdrawn
and
no
other
lands
are
withdrawn
but
the
notice
of
public
agencies
does
not
have
a
meaning
on
the
face
of
the
permit.
it
is
not
limited
in
the
withdrawal
against
the
preference
right
under
section
7
(a)
to
the
lands
the
power
sites
described.
it
extends
up
and
down
the
river
to
all
competing
sites.
now
the
question
of
a
notice
to
which
i
have
referred,
i
should
like
to
simply
say
here
what
i
say
at
page
29
of
my
opening
brief,
the
question
is
not
whether
the
issuance
of
a
permit
or
receive
a
notice
of
an
application
puts
everyone
on
notice
that
the
permitee
hopes
to
build
a
project
and
that
if
he
does,
this
will
foreclose
the
development
of
competing
projects.
and
the
question
is
not
whether
the
municipality
learns
somehow
of
what
is
going
on
after
that
permit
issues.
it's
too
late.
his
preference
right
upon
the
competing
site,
high
mountain
sheep
and
nez
perce
was
killed
off
the
day
that
permit
issued
and
can
never
be
revived
while
that
permit
is
alive.
the
question
is
whether
the
commission's
issuance
of
a
statutory
notice
to
public
agencies
of
a
permit
application
for
a
specific
site
on
a
navigable
stream
puts
them
on
notice
that
a
permitee
is
to
get
an
affirmative
priority
upon
all
other
sites
in
competition
with
those
that
he
has
preempted.
now
to
translate
this
to
any
other
field
of
a
public
land
and
navigable
streams
laws
of
which
the
court
is
familiar,
this
means
that
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
enacted
by
the
same
congress
in
1920,
if
you
apply
for
a
prospecting
permit
on
the
public
lands,
they're
good
for
a
limited
time
just
as
these
permits
were
described
in
specific
areas,
just
as
this
permit
did.
and
if
you
drill
your
well
four
miles
outside
the
boundaries
of
your
permit
which
is
the
distance
of
high
mountain
sheep
was
from
the
nearest
boundary
of
this
permit
and
affect
the
discovery
that
somehow
you
have
acquired
under
the
1920
mineral
leasing
act
a
right
to
a
lease.
now
congress
never
before
has
granted
any
options,
any
floating
easements
upon
either
the
public
lands
or
this
--
the
navigable
streams
of
the
united
states.
and
it
did
not
intend
we
say
to
disable
and
cripple
the
public
preference
who
have
carefully
made
mandatory
in
the
legislative
history
by
giving
the
permitee
this
option
to
roam
to
transfer
his
priorities.
reference
was
made
yesterday
to
the
legislative
history
and
again
this
morning.
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
rather
careful
review
of
the
legislative
history
in
appendix
c
to
my
opening
brief,
this
is
at
page
19a.
and
on
the
specific
point
that
has
made
this
morning
and
yesterday
as
to
whether
this
priority
of
preference
agencies
must
be
asserted
at
the
permit
stage.
congress
specifically
took
up
this
proposal
by
utility
spokesman
and
did
not
adopt
it.
instead,
it
adopted
language
that
preserved
the
preference
for
assertion
either
at
the
permit
stage
or
three
years
later
at
the
licensing
stage.
and
it
specifically
made
it
clear
--
pardon
me,
i
should
give
you
the
citations
of
this.
this
point
is
covered
in
our
reply
brief
under
my
heading
number
6
beginning
to
page
29.
congress
refused
to
limit
their
preference
to
the
permit
stage.
it
preserved
it
to
the
licensing
stage.
why
should
a
public
agency
interested
in
the
high
mountain
sheep
or
nez
perce
be
forced
to
come
in
with
a
preemptive
permit
application
because
it
receives
a
notice
of
an
application
for
the
project
which
it
feels
is
worthless
and
is
not
going
to
get
a
license
which
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
now
bear
in
mind
that
under
section
7
(a),
a
public
agency
fairly
warned,
fairly
warned,
can
wipe
the
(inaudible)
clean
of
the
competing
permit
application
of
the
company
instantly
by
filing
a
preemptive
permit
application
of
its
own.
there's
no
conditions
to
that,
whatever.
if
the
state
of
washington
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
section
7
(a)
is
the
statute
time
relying
upon.
and
that
section
says
in
terms
that
a
public
agency
shall
have
preference
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
to
the
public
agency,
the
state
or
municipality,
the
language
of
the
statute
is,
in
issuing
preliminary
permits
hereunder
or
licenses
where
no
preliminary
permit
has
been
issued
the
commission
shall
give
preference
to
applications
therefore
by
states
and
municipalities.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
refrain
--
let
me
divide
this
into
two
parts.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
your
question
refers
to
the
permit
stage
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
a
permit
application
notice
fairly
discloses
what
the
company
asks,
and
if
a
public
agency
responding
to
that
notice
files
a
competing
application
for
a
permit,
the
mandate
is
flapped.
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
gets
the
permit
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
about
that
in
our
legislative
history.
that's
its
purpose.
the
problem
arises
that
if
the
company
gets
the
permit
as
it
did
here
on
the
phase
of
a
notice
restricting
the
application
to
a
project
in
which
we
had
no
interest.
then
three
years
later,
as
it
did
here
on
the
last
day
of
the
permit
say
we
changed
our
minds
now.
we
now
claim
under
that
permit
projects
that
we
disclaimed
when
we
asked
for
the
permit
the
question
is
now
whether
at
the
licensing
stage
our
preference
has
survived
so
that
we
may
assert
that
preference
against
the
project
excluded
on
the
day
the
permit
was
applied
for
but
now
purportedly
included
on
the
day
that
the
company
applies
for
a
license
on
the
new
project.
mr.
northcutt
ely
because
the
public
agencies
of
the
northwest
had
confidence
that
the
application
for
the
pleasant
valley
project
would
be
rejected
as
an
inferior
project
and
it
was
rejected.
the
commission
turned
it
down.
we're
under
no
necessity
to
come
in
with
the
elaborate
engineering
and
the
expense
of
filing
a
prematurely,
a
competing
application
on
some
other
site
when
the
one
being
applied
for
on
its
phase
didn't
deserve
a
license.
they
took
the
gamble
properly
that
the
commission
would
reject
that
application
and
it
did.
now
the
question,
one
of
the
questions
in
the
cases,
did
the
permit
survive
the
rejection
of
that
license
application?
it
was
rejected
on
grounds
which
we
say
precluded
its
reassertion
on
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
and
indeed
the
company
asked
for
time
to
substitute
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
to
make
new
investigations.
the
commission
denied
this
application
on
rehearing.
but
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
pleasant
valley
was
within
the
red
area,
within
the
announced
boundaries
of
their
permit.
no
question
about
that.
and
the
question
is
whether
they
got
an
extra
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
on
that
site
because
it
was
within
the
boundaries
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
of
the
notice.
now
may
i
just
point
out
in
the
record
where
you'll
find
some
of
the
things
to
which
i
have
referred
here.
first
i
should
say
now
but
i'm
sure
the
court
realizes
that
this
was
a
three
to
two
decision
by
the
federal
power
commission
dissent
on
the
original
opinion
filed
by
chairman
swidler
joined
by
vice
chairman
black
on
rehearing
assigned
by
vice
chairman
black
joined
by
swidler.
these
are
powerful
dissents
and
they
appear
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
687
as
it
refers
to
the
comments
which
i'd
like
to
refer.
yesterday
a
great
deal
was
made
of
the
commission's
intent
to
deal
fairly
and
of
course
it
does
intend
to
deal
fairly.
but
two
members
of
the
commission
thought
the
result
here
was
grotesquely
unfair
and
it
was
a
distortion
of
a
statute.
and
mrs.
chairman
swidler
at
page
701
of
the
record,
the
majority's
position
is
unreasonable
because
of
the
inadequate
notice.
indeed
the
wholly
false
and
misleading
notice
provided
by
a
preliminary
permit
under
this
interpretation
and
the
resulting
failure
to
get
potential
competing
applicants
and
other
interested
parties,
the
statutory
notice
to
which
they
are
entitled.
and
he
said
at
page
701
the
majority
position
is
mystifying
because
it
interprets
a
permit
application
as
meeting
something
other
than
what
it
says
whereas
to
some
compelling
reason
of
congressional
purpose
advanced
in
support
of
this
transmutation
i
might
be
persuaded
but
no
reason
is
given.
now,
i'd
like
to
ask
your
attention
to
the
particular
permit
application
and
the
map
which
a
company
did.
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
never
in
a
contested
case,
your
honor.
there
had
been
a
number
of
uncontested
cases
in
which
as
a
matter
of
internal
housekeeping.
the
commission
has
sometimes
required
amendments,
other
times
rejected
them.
but
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
this
is
the
first
time
there's
been
a
coalition
between
a
preference
claim
and
a
claim
of
priority
under
a
permit.
as
chairman
swidler
says,
this
is
a
benchmark
case
that
in
which
the
commission
gives
vast
and
sweeping
effect
to
the
priority
of
permit
and
on
unjustifiably
restricts
the
preference
congress
intended
for
public
agencies.
mr.
northcutt
ely
applied
for
a
license.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
this
was
in
1960,
about
five
months
after
we
received
a
notice
of
license
application
by
the
company
upon
high
mountain
sheep.
while
a
file
pro
forma
application
on
march
31,
1958
accompanied
by
maps
of
the
rejected
dams,
it
filed
finally
18
months
later
the
papers
you
now
have
before
you
and
then
the
commission
gave
notice.
and
then
within
five
months
after
that
we
filed
our
application.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
this
priority
issue
was
muted
at
that
time.
it
was
really
--
came
in
rather
later
if
i
may
say
so.
the
notion
that
this
permit
did
indeed
give
them
priority
was
a
very
touchy
one.
they
filed
a
petition
for
that.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
i
don't
think
it
had
occurred
to
anybody
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
that
the
permit
in
fact
gave
a
priority
on
nez
perce.
the
first
time
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir
that's
--
and
mr.
solomon
is
correct.
if
the
priority
extended
by
extra
laterally
beyond
the
permit
to
encompass
high
mountain
sheep
it
did
indeed
include
nez
perce.
but
we
never
heard
of
that
at
the
time.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
we
--
well,
yes
by
the
examiner.
we
did
not
push
it
after
it
became
apparent
that
the
fishery
problems
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
we
sought
to
it,
the
examiner
denied
the
--
our
privilege.
the
commission
finally
affirmed
it
on
their
final
opinion
to
substitute
high
mountain
sheep.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
he
did
not
feel
that
public
power
had
any
right
to
come
in
with
this
late
in
the
day
and
move
to
amend
to
substitute
high
mountain
sheep.
he
was
just
anti
and
the
commission
overruled
it,
but
too
late
to
do
as
much
good,
the
case
was
over
by
that
time.
i
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
are
called
a
joint
operate
--
joint
operating
agency
created
by
a
statute
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
justice
douglas,
this
is
a
response
to
your
question,
i
understand
mr.
justice
black.
the
washington
public
power
supply
system
is
created
as
a
joint
operating
agency
under
a
statute
of
the
state
of
washington
that
authorizes
public
utility
districts
to
exercise
their
powers
jointly.
we
are
also
a
successor
by
act
of
the
washington
legislature
to
the
washington
power
commission
which
it
had
been
set
up
initially
to
do
this
kind
of
a
job
to
build
great
projects
perhaps
outside
the
state's
boundaries.
the
joint
operating
agency
is
a
--
as
a
subsequent
creation
device
of
the
washington
legislature
described
as
a
municipality
by
the
washington
statute,
by
the
commission,
and
by
the
court
below.
it
is
a
municipal
corporation
comprised
of
16
public
utility
districts
within
the
state
of
washington
exercising
their
joint
powers
in
this
way.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right.
to
do
what
is
beyond
the
financial
powers
or
anyone
of
them
alone.
mr.
northcutt
ely
in
a
broad
sense,
yes,
they
are
locally
created,
locally
managed
by
board
of
three
elected
officers
within
each
county.
and
they
build
and
operate
projects.
the
state
of
washington
is
unique
in
this
form
of
organization.
about
half
of
the
population
of
washington
is
served
by
the
16
public
utility
districts
who
are
here
exercising
their
joint
powers.
before
i
leave,
may
i
say
i
haven't
said
anything
about
the
fish
because
the
fish
to
my
mind
are
indeed
a
red
herring
here,
this
subject
is
covered
in
my
reply
brief.
mr.
northcutt
ely
may
it
please
the
court.
in
number
462,
we
are
concerned
also
with
the
high
mountain
sheep
project.
the
antagonist
here
however
are
the
washington
public
power
and
supply
system,
an
applicant
for
a
license,
a
public
agency
of
the
state
of
washington
in
a
municipality,
and
the
power
company.
the
washington
public
power
supply
system
is
composed
of
16
public
utility
districts
operating
in
its
many
counties
in
the
state
of
washington
and
the
serving
of
--
about
half
of
the
state's
population.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
dam
is
about
15
miles
upstream
from
the
washington
line
on
the
boundaries
between
idaho
and
oregon.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
sir.
the
state
of
idaho
asserts
that
it
has
the
power
to
veto
the
selection
by
the
federal
power
commission
of
this
public
agency
of
the
state
of
washington
as
a
licensee
and
we
denied
a
veto
power
of
the
state
of
idaho.
we
say
that
under
this
court's
decisions
in
the
tacoma
case
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
that
we
have
a
capacity
that
we
are
licensed
to
carry
out
all
of
the
terms
of
the
license
within
the
state
of
idaho
and
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
northcutt
ely
a
municipality
in
order
to
claim
the
preference
under
section
7
(a)
that
we
do
claim.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
so
held
in
the
court
below
and
so
held
by
the
commission
so
to
speak.
a
map
behind
me
shows
the
snake
river
in
this
area
as
mr.
claiborne
told
you
that
flows
north
toward
the
top
of
the
map
and
is
joined
by
two
major
tributaries
in
this
area.
the
salmon
--
i
mean
in
the
--
from
the
east,
the
imnaha
coming
in
from
the
west.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
this
municipality
is
or
is
not
entitled
to
a
preference
under
section
7
(a)
of
the
act
which
directs
that
the
commission
in
granting
permits
and
in
granting
licenses
for
a
no
preliminary
permit
has
been
issued,
shall
give
preference
to
the
application
of
a
state
or
a
municipality
and
it
goes
on
to
say
provided
that
the
plans
are
the
same
or
equally
well-adopted
or
may
shall
within
a
reasonable
time
to
be
fixed
by
the
commission
be
made
as
well-adopted
as
also
its
competitor.
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
proviso
of
the
section
7,
namely
the
opportunity
it
gives
us
to
make
our
plants
as
well
adopted
and
so
as
the
power
company
for
the
reason
that
the
power
that
the
plants
submitted
here
by
the
municipality
provided
a
power
installation
of
more
than
30%
larger
than
that
which
the
company
proposed.
and
while
the
commission
upon
its
initial
opinion
held
that
the
company's
plant,
this
smaller
plant,
was
vested
after
to
the
development
of
the
resource.
on
rehearing,
it
found
specifically
that
the
plan
exactly
as
we
had
proposed
for
the
larger
plant,
1,200,000
in
kilowatts
was
vested
after
and
substituted
that
description
but
licensed
the
plant
which
we
had
developed
to
the
company
solely
under
the
compulsion
of
a
permit,
a
permit
which
have
been
issued
to
the
company
as
chairman
swidler
said
in
his
dissent
for
the
investigation
of
an
entirely
different
project
upon
which
the
commission
itself
had
rejected
their
license
application.
the
primary
question
before
the
court
is
whether
this
permit
issued
for
the
investigation
of
another
project
indeed
was
intended
to
encompass
the
high
mountain
sheep
project.
may
i
have
the
red
overlay
here?
this
permit
has
the
following
background.
the
corps
of
engineers
starting
in
1947
and
down
to
1954
when
the
company
applied
for
this
permit
had
published
four
reports
on
the
power
potentialities
of
the
snake
river.
it
had
pointed
out
that
there
are
three
mutually
inconsistent
power
projects
for
the
development
of
this
reach
of
the
river.
the
three,
i
should
interrupt
to
say
that
neither
the
company,
nor
we
nor
the
secretary
can
claim
to
be
pioneers
or
discoverers
of
anything
in
this
area.
the
corps
of
engineers
had
fully
investigated,
drilled,
designed
projects,
all
the
ones
i
am
going
to
describe
and
all
that
we
are
doing
is
to
modify
and
improve
on
the
corps'
plans.
this
is
a
thoroughly
known
resource.
this
is
no
unknown
river.
the
three
plants
that
the
corps
had
proposed
which
are
mutually
exclusive,
we
provide
first
for
the
construction
of
a
dam
at
the
nez
perce
dam
site
which
would
impound
the
waters
of
both
the
salmon
and
of
the
snake.
these
are
great
rivers.
the
snake
flows
about
13
million
acre
feet.
the
salmon
about
8
--
about
a
22
million
acre-foot
resource.
this
is
substantially
larger
than
the
flow
of
the
colorado
river
(inaudible).
the
dam
in
nez
perce
would
impound
both
of
these
streams
and
would
be
the
best
place
for
a
power
dam.
beyond
doubt
any
single
dam
could
be
built
upon
the
stream.
it
had
the
great
disadvantage
of
blocking
the
salmon
river,
which
is
the
source
of
some
25%
or
more
of
all
the
salmon
on
the
columbia
river
system.
and
their
problem
was
whether
you
could
or
could
not
get
fish
over
a
high
dam
and
get
the
fingerlings
back
down.
the
next
report
or
the
next
project
that
the
court
reported
on
was
an
alternative,
which
was
to
build
a
dam
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
dam
site,
which
is
above
the
salmon
and
consequently
avoids
interference
with
the
fish
runs
on
the
salmon,
but
this
is
below
the
confluence
of
the
imnaha
which
is
itself
a
fish
stream
of
some
importance.
the
third
alternative
is
to
build
a
dam
at
the
pleasant
valley
dam
site,
which
is
far
or
less
attractive
than
the
other
two
but
does
have
the
advantage
and
it
avoids
both
the
imnaha
and
the
salmon
and
the
controversy
with
fisheries.
all
of
these
potentialities
have
one
limiting
factor.
that
is
an
elevation
of
1,510
feet
above
sea
level
is
about
the
maximum
that
you
can
raise
any
of
these
reservoirs
to
without
too
much
interference
with
the
hells
canyon
dam.
as
i
say,
these
three
mutually
inconsistent
potentialities
were
well-known
prior
to
1954
when
the
company
with
the
co-reports
before
it
the
latest
of
them
being
the
1954
report
as
suggested
the
pleasant
valley
scheme
decided
to
apply
for
a
permit.
now
the
choice
was
deliberate.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
you
are
parsing
the
terms
of
a
contract
to
the
--
to
discover
its
interpretation.
this
is
a
ticket
bought
for
a
specific
destination
and
not
--
and
for
none
other.
the
company
as
it
has
explained
in
a
document
filed
with
the
commission
in
the
licensee
proceedings
that
grew
out
of
this
pleasant
valley
application
deliberately
chose
this
project
to
avoid
trouble
with
the
fish
industry
on
the
salmon
and
imnaha
rivers.
the
statute
directs
that
upon
the
filing
of
an
application
for
a
preliminary
permit,
the
commission
before
acting
upon
that
application
shall
“at
once
give
notice
in
writing”
to
the
states
and
the
municipalities
likely
to
be
affected
by
it
and
shall
publics
--
publish
that
notice
in
the
counties
where
the
project
is
located.
the
reason
for
this,
as
a
legislative
history
develops
in
our
brief
so
amply
demonstrates
is
a
very
simple
one.
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
permit
upon
a
specific
project
nullifies
a
public
preference
upon
that
project
from
that
day
forward.
it
cannot
be
revived
at
the
licensing
stage.
if
a
permit
issues
and
if
the
project
is
within
the
--
encompass
of
the
permit,
the
public
preference
is
nullified
upon
that
particular
project
and
for
this
reason,
the
statute
and
the
commission's
regulations
are
very
specific
as
to
what
that
notice
shall
say.
they
require
the
--
that
the
notice
be
accompanied
by
a
map.
this
map
shall
show
the
project
boundaries
whether
or
not
public
lands
are
involved
and
if
public
lands
are
involved,
then
the
map
must
show
not
only
down
through
the
corner-to-corner
sections
but
to
10
acres
lots,
what
the
area
encompassed
by
the
project
boundaries
is.
the
company
applied
for
a
permit
and
attached
the
necessary
map.
the
map
deliberately
excluded
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
by
three
and
seven-tenths
miles.
it
avoided
the
armageddon
at
nez
perce
by
five
miles.
the
reservoir
boundaries
are
shown
in
red
upon
the
map
behind
me.
these
are
the
elevations
taken
for
the
two
dams
from
the
notice
given
pursuant
to
the
statute
by
the
commission
to
the
public
agencies
whose
preferences
might
be
affected.
these
are
reprinted
as
appendices
to
our
opening
brief,
a
public
notice.
the
application
has
been
specific.
the
map
has
been
specific.
and
the
commission's
notice
was
even
more
so.
it
tied
down
the
locations
of
the
dams
themselves
by
reference
to
the
public
land
surveys.
it
described
the
elevations
above
sea
level
as
i've
shown
them
on
this
map,
it
described
the
project
specifically.
this
was
not
an
application
for
a
general
permit
to
investigate
all
three
of
these
projects.
they
didn't
want
the
two
sticky
ones.
this
was
an
application
for
a
permit
to
investigate
the
more
bland,
upstream
one
--
the
pleasant
valley
one.
now
as
mr.
claiborne
has
told
you,
it
included
also
a
re-regulating
reservoir
at
mountain
sheep.
now,
mountain
sheep
dam
contributes
nothing
to
this
case
except
the
confusion,
the
names,
it
was
to
be
a
lower
dam
of
this
site
not
to
be
confused
with
this
--
with
the
site
we're
now
in
controversy
about
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
below
mountain
sheep
dam,
would
have
been
a
relatively
low
one,
the
major
dam
was
the
pleasant
valley
to
be
matched
against
nez
perce
and
high
mountain
sheep.
the
--
nobody
objected
to
the
issuance
of
that
permit.
the
public
agencies
as
commissioner
chairman
swidler
points
out
where
intensely
interested
and
anything
done
about
the
nez
perce
site
to
some
extent
about
the
high
mountain
sheep
site,
but
nobody
wanted
this
inferior
pleasant
valley
site.
the
public
agencies
took
their
chance
that
the
commission
would
reject
the
license
upon
that
site.
the
commission
did
reject
the
license
on
it
in
1958.
the
--
if
i
may
interrupt
again
to
say
here
that
the
issue
i
must
keep
coming
back
to
is
whether
or
not
the
permit,
when
issued
in
1955
on
that
one
magic
day,
did
or
did
not
nullify
the
preference
within
not
only
within
the
red
area
shown
as
the
boundary
of
the
permit
but
outside
that
boundary
upon
any
and
all
potentially
competing
projects.
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
does
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
permit
for
a
specifically
described
project
with
specifically
limited
boundaries
so
defined
in
the
public
notice
automatically
give
the
permitee
some
extra
lateral
kind
of
a
privilege
upon
public
lands
and
navigable
waters
that
he
has
not
asked
for
and
has
not
modified
any
public
agency
claims?
did
or
did
not
this
notice
of
the
application
for
the
permit
put
the
public
agencies
upon
notice
that
if
this
permit
issued
for
the
project
shown
in
red,
it
would
automatically
terminate
the
preference
not
only
within
the
red
area
but
beyond
it.
now,
may
i
have
the
horizontal
line?
the
commission
in
1958
denied
a
license
application
upon
the
pleasant
valley
project
which
i've
just
described
the
areas
shown
in
red.
it
did
so
upon
the
ground
that
the
--
it
was
not
adequately
adopted
to
the
development
of
the
resource
that
to
any
project,
referring
to
the
same
corps
of
engineer's
reports
that
i've
mentioned,
that
any
project
which
excluded
nez
perce,
was
inferior
to
any
project
which
included
nez
perce
and
that
the
commission
entertained
great
confidence
that
the
fishery
problem
at
nez
perce
could
and
would
be
solved.
they
denied
the
application
for
a
license
therefore
upon
the
pleasant
valley.
the
company
applied
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
its
petition
said
that
it
wanted
additional
time.
it
had
only
less
than
a
month
to
go
before
the
three-year
term
of
its
permit
would
expire.
it
would
need
10
more
months
to
investigate
other
possibilities
that
it
pointed
out
to
the
commission
that
no
consideration
had
been
given
to
a
dam
at
--
on
a
site
between
the
salmon
and
the
imnaha.
that
is
the
very
site
we're
now
quarreling
about,
high
mountain
sheep.
and
it
wanted
adequate
time
to
investigate
to
that,
to
nez
perce
and
other
possibilities
and
that
it
made
the
point
that
by
denying
our
application
without
saying
something
about
the
priority
of
our
permit,
our
rights
may
be
lost.
we
want
assurance
that
our
permit
will
apply
to
the
new
project
we
hope
to
bring
before
you
in
10
months.
now
the
commission
has
denied
that
petition
for
rehearing
and
they
wrote
in
opinion
denying
it
after
the
application
which
is
now
before
the
court
was
filed
by
the
company
on
march
31.
on
march
31,
1958,
the
last
day
of
the
life
of
the
permits,
the
company
filed
the
application
which
are
--
you
now
have
before
you.
it
was
for
a
project
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
now,
it
is
quite
apparent
with
the
no
part
--
no
investigation
of
any
moment
had
been
made
of
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
within
the
three-year
term
of
the
permit.
we
have
in
volume
3
of
the
record,
29
maps
that
the
company
annexed
to
its
application
for
that
license,
the
license
now
before
you.
these
appear
beginning
at
page
883.
and
if
you'll
examine
these,
you
will
find
that
they
are
all
maps,
location
maps,
designs,
borings
of
sites,
relating
to
the
two
dams
that
are
just
been
rejected,
pleasant
valley
and
mountain
--
and
low
mountain
sheep.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
high
mountain
sheep
project
and
indeed
the
company
did
not
file
for
some
18
months,
the
application
which
is
truly
before
you,
one
with
the
designs,
plans,
specifications,
and
the
language
of
the
act
conforming
to
the
requirements
of
license
application.
now
in
the
meantime,
this
is
what
happened.
now,
i
may
say
that
not
until
19
months
have
gone
by
after
these
three-year
period
of
the
permit
did
the
commission
issue
the
license
of
section
4
(e)
of
the
act,
requires
it
to
give
again
to
public
agencies
upon
the
filing
of
a
license
application.
now
on
march
31,
1958
the
application
of
the
company
filed
and
completed
in
18
months
later
show
this.
this
map
shows
again,
in
the
area
in
red,
the
reservoir
elevations
of
the
original
notice
of
the
permit
application
to
us
given
in
1954
-1955.
the
area
above
the
pleasant
valley
is
not
greatly
different
because
the
reservoir
elevations
are
about
the
same.
this
map
shows
the
area
specifically
in
controversy
here.
the
area
in
red
is
the
permit
area,
the
permit
notice
area.
the
area
in
blue
is
the
additional
area
of
the
reservoirs
which
would
be
flooded
--
the
reservoir
which
would
be
flooded
by
the
high
mountain
sheep
dams
disclosed
for
the
first
time
in
the
license
application.
now
the
problem
is
whether
the
permit
or
the
area
in
red
and
more
specifically
the
notice
to
public
agencies,
the
applications
for
that
permit,
did
or
did
not
preempt
the
high
mountain
sheep
resource.
and
in
1955
therefore,
some
three
years
before
this
plan
was
first
disclosed,
did
it
or
did
it
not
kill
for
all
time
our
preference
right
upon
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
here,
we
reached
the
two
conflicting
philosophies
of
what
the
federal
power
act
is
intended
to
do.
we
say
that
the
dominant
purpose
of
the
act
is
the
development
of
the
nation's
waterways,
the
discovery
of
the
best
adopted
plans
to
do
so
and
the
direction
that
this
development
shall
be
carried
out
by
public
agencies,
preference
to
public
agencies
if
their
plans
are
as
well-adopted
as
those
offered
by
private
competitors.
here,
the
two
policies
are
converged.
we
say
that
the
preference
is
nullified
only
within
the
single
narrow
exception
that
the
act
points
out,
namely,
within
the
area
circumscribed
encompassed
by
a
preliminary
permit.
we
say
that,
given
a
case
in
which
we
presented
a
project
within
the
red
area
in
competition
with
the
project
proposed
by
the
company
within
the
red
area,
then
our
preference
would
prevail
still
if
our
project
were
superior
to
theirs.
but
we
don't
have
to
show
superiority.
but
if
the
permit
would
give
the
--
a
priority
to
the
company
within
the
red
area,
what
we
say
that
outside
of
the
red
area,
outside
the
area
encompassed
by
the
permit,
the
preference
to
public
agencies
remained
intact,
unscathed,
and
that
we
were
entitled
to
come
forward
with
a
project
for
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
relying
upon
our
preference,
totally
unaffected
by
any
priority
which
the
company
might
have
acquired
within
the
red
area
by
a
permit
to
that
red
area.
the
opposing
view
is
that
the
act
was
designed
to
promote
the
development
of
the
nation's
waterways
by
private
enterprise,
private
capital
that
its
purpose
was
to
protect
the
investment
of
the
entrepreneur
and
that
consequently
the
permitee
in
general
and
specifically
in
this
case,
is
--
has
not
only
the
right,
he
has
the
obligation
to
develop,
to
discover,
to
investigate
all
the
competing
mutually
exclusive
projects
affecting
the
same
reach
of
the
river.
and
that
therefore,
since
he
has
this
obligation,
he
has
this
right,
the
issuance
to
him
of
a
permit
for
a
single
and
inferior
site
here,
the
pleasant
valley
site,
gave
him
by
implication
of
law
a
permit,
a
right
to
occupy
the
nez
perce
site,
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
that
from
the
beginning
therefore,
our
preference
was
nullified
as
to
these
exterior
sites.
now
the
legislative
history
we
think
is
very
clear
that
this
sort
of
an
option
was
never
conferred
by
the
statute
upon
a
permitee.
this
would
be
a
truly
remarkable
public
resource
statute.
if
an
applicant
who
is
required
to
describe
by
metes
and
bounds
reference
to
the
public
land
surveys,
the
lands,
the
dam
sites
that
he
wants
to
occupy
and
upon
which
he
demands
a
priority,
somehow
got
from
the
united
states
a
right
greater
than
any
asked
for
and
greater
than
was
described
in
the
grant
giving.
it
would
be
a
remarkable
thing
if
congress
have
been
carefully
spelled
out
the
preference
for
public
power
in
the
statute
and
given
only
one
exception
to
that
preference,
namely
where
a
permit
had
been
issued
intended
by
application
to
give
a
permitee
a
right
to
paralyze
a
public
preference
upon
any
site
where
he
elected
to
transfer
his
option.
at
the
end
of
the
three
years,
mind
you,
at
the
end
of
the
three
years
and
not
at
the
beginning
when
he
makes
this
election
and
gives
his
notice.
we
think
that
chairman
swidler's
characterization
of
the
majority
of
the
commission's
construction
of
the
act
is
unanswerable.
he
says
that
he
declines
the
act
(inaudible)
in
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
that
unfair
that
the
notice
given
us
in
1954
or
1955
of
the
limited
scope
for
this
permit,
we
were
entitled
to
believe.
and
since
the
statute
and
the
act
of
the
commission
made
it
specific,
it
was
indeed
specific
that
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
can
or
cannot
grant
an
indefinite
permit
to
investigate
all
the
sites
on
the
great
stretch
of
the
river.
it's
--
is
to
simply
limit
this,
the
permit
here.
this
was
definite.
now,
the
legislative
history
also
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
that
this
preference
might
be
asserted
either
at
the
permit
stage
when
the
permit
is
issued
or
asserted
at
the
licensing
stage.
that
a
public
agency
is
not
bound,
slow
moving
as
these
political
bodies
are
is
not
bound
to
guess
when
it
receives
a
notice
describing
one
project
that
a
priority
may
be
claimed
displacing
the
preference
on
an
entirely
different
project
and
therefore
at
its
peril
come
in
and
apply
for
a
permit
on
that
same
project
or
a
competing
project
at
the
permit
stage.
the
legislative
history
shows
the
recognition
that
these
public
agencies
moved
slowly
and
they
must
have
an
opportunity
at
a
later
time.
now
the
argument
made
against
this
is
really
circular.
it's
that
it
goes
like
this.
that
since
the
permitee
has
the
obligation
to
investigate
all
competing
sites
to
discover
which
was
the
best-adopted,
to
develop
the
resource,
therefore,
his
permit
must
be
given
an
elastic
set
of
rubber
boundaries
to
encompass
everything
that
might
be
better
than
--
that
he
selected
in
the
first
place
and
that
therefore
the
notice
he
gave
to
public
agencies
must
be
similarly
elongated
and
that
the
application
itself
must
be
stretched
in
this
way.
now
this
procrustean
theory
of
the
operation
of
a
federal
grant
of
an
interest
in
this
precious
resource
is
a
noble
construction
of
the
statute,
particularly
where
it
is
used
as
a
device
to
nullify,
to
kill-off
a
major
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
recognition
of
the
public
preference
in
areas
other
than
those
encompassed
by
the
permit
itself.
the
--
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
we're
not
truly
concerned
here
with
the
question
of
parsing
the
words,
the
nouns
and
verbs
of
the
permit
of
the
application
and
the
notice
because
the
company's
own
petition
for
rehearing
and
its
supporting
documents
in
the
pleasant
valley
case
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
weren't
buying
any
ticket
on
the
--
to
the
high
mountain
sheep
or
nez
perce
sites.
they
wanted
to
avoid
those
destinations
and
it
would
be
only
inadvertence
if
we
now
find
in
the
permit
that's
so
carefully
excluded
them
language
which
now
includes
what
was
then
excluded.
but
because
they
do
make
such
a
point,
that
the
permit
on
its
face
was
intended
to
include
these
other
two
sites,
we
have
in
our
briefs
spelled
this
out
to
some
care,
the
--
especially
in
our
reply
brief
and
we
find
that
this
specific
project
is
defined,
it's
referred
to
and
named
21
times
the
two
sites,
the
pleasant
valley
and
low
mountain
sheep
are
defined
and
referred
to
five
times,
not
once
as
to
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
referred
to,
not
once
as
nez
perce
referred
to.
the
map,
the
only
map
we're
entitled
to
rely
on
deliberately
excludes
these
two
sites.
and
how
else
would
you
exclude
them
more
explicitly
unless
the
commission
put
it
--
the
foot
of
the
permit,
we
really
mean
this.
a
word
or
two
about
the
equities
involved
here.
the
company
has
--
and
the
commission,
make
much
of
the
fact
that
the
power
company
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
in
investigating
--
first,
the
pleasant
valley
project
and
now,
high
mountain
sheep
and
this
is
true.
its
testimony
shows
that
it
spent
some
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
in
working
up
its
plans
for
the
pleasant
valley
site
which
the
power
commission
found
was
inferior.
following
the
decision
of
the
power
commission
saying
that
nez
perce
was
the
best
site,
both
the
company
and
ourselves
spent
a
great
deal
of
money.
we
relied
upon
the
commission's
determination,
the
finding
to
that
effect
and
filed
an
application
for
a
license
on
nez
perce
and
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
on
it
to
discover
as
the
trial
went
along
that
the
fish
problems
did
indeed
seem
to
be
insurmountable
for
the
immediate
future.
although
we
had
put
into
our
nez
perce
plans
some
33
million
dollars
of
proposed
investment
as
we
take
care
of
fish
and
the
most
modern
devices
as
any
experts
could
think
of.
so
we
transferred
--
we
have
moved
to
substitute
high
mountain
sheep
ourselves.
we
both
got
through
it
the
hard
way.
now,
it's
true
one
or
the
other
of
this
is
going
to
lose
several
million
of
investment
in
planning
projects
if
the
other
gets
the
license.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
a
criteria
of
the
statute,
the
fact
that
the
company
spent
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
to
investigate
a
project
that
the
commission
rejected,
pleasant
valley
doesn't
necessarily
give
it
a
first
right
upon
the
next
project.
the
fact
that
we
spent
money
on
a
project
now
abandoned,
nez
perce,
we
don't
claim
gives
us
an
equity
or
first
right
on
the
nez
perce
either.
we
rely
upon
the
statutory
of
preference
to
public
agencies.
now
it's
an
ironic
fact
that
the
project
which
the
company
first
proposed
for
high
mountain
sheep
after
the
rejection
of
pleasant
valley
would
have
provided
less,
install
capacity
less,
capability
in
kilowatts
and
less
production
of
energy
in
kilowatt
hours
than
the
pleasant
valley
project
that
the
commission
had
just
rejected.
its
only
virtue
was
that
it
provided
for
ultimate
installation
which
would
have
been
larger
than
the
rejected
project.
and
our
project
is,
as
i
said,
some
37%
larger
than
the
--
than
that
proposed
by
the
company
for
this
same
site.
so
that
--
i
do
not
think
the
equities
bear
against
us.
now,
as
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
on
the
original
opinion,
the
commission
approved
the
smaller
project
proposed
by
the
company,
875,000
kilowatts.
we
had
proposed
a
1,200,000
kilowatt
plant.
on
rehearing,
the
commission
found
that
the
larger
plant
was
“best
adapted”
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
in
the
language
of
section
10
(a)
--
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
best-adapted,
best
adapted
to
the
development
of
the
resource
as
the
commission
said,
under
the
criteria
of
section
10
(a).
but
it
licensed
the
larger
plant
which
the
company
had
never
proposed
and
which
we
had
designed.
it
licensed
that
plant
to
the
company
on
the
ground
that
its
priority
gave
it
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
that
this
was
a
plan
best-adapted
for
that
site,
the
company
is
entitled
with.
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
except
that
--
but
for
public
powers
coming
in
to
this
picture.
mr.
northcutt
ely
this
project
--
this
magnificent
site
would
be
underdeveloped.
mr.
northcutt
ely
preference.
you're
quite
correct
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
your
honor.
yes.
if
we
had
never
come
into
the
picture
and
if
the
commission
on
its
own
motion
had
discovered
that
1,200,000
kilowatts
was
best,
it
should
have
demanded
the
company
to
build
it.
that's
correct.
now,
with
respect
to
the
government's
case
or
the
solicitor
general's
that
you've
heard,
our
strong
belief
is
that
both
of
these
cases
should
be
reversed
and
remanded.
the
secretary's
case
and
ours
as
the
commission
has
said
are
inextricably
entwined.
we
propose
a
project
which
would
pour
its
entire
output
into
the
bonneville
system.
we
were
going
to
build
transmission
lines
from
this
plant
to
connect
with
bonneville.
we
proposed
that
the
plant
be
integrated
into
the
bonneville
system,
the
power
dispatched
by
the
united
states.
we
believe
that
the
criterion
that
is
written
into
the
water
canyon
project
act
that
the
secretary
shall
control
all
water
passing
the
dam
for
all
purposes
is
in
the
public
interest.
there
is
more
to
the
integration
of
this
resource
than
simply
an
agreement
among
companies
if
they'll
somehow
trade
power.
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me?
the
coordination
agreement?
mr.
northcutt
ely
this
was
--
i
cannot
give
you
the
specific
dates.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
the
--
go
ahead,
mr.
solomon.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
feel
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
feel,
your
honor,
that
if
the
commission
has
another
opportunity
to
act
upon
a
fresh
record
instead
of
a
stale
one,
it
is
bound
to
reach
a
better
result.
if
that
should
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
if
the
commission
on
its
wisdom
should
decide
on
a
new
and
fresh
record
that
the
project
should
be
built
by
the
united
states,
i
think
you
would
find
the
washington
public
power
supply
system
actively
supporting
the
legislation
to
do
that
and
i'm
sure
you'd
find
the
power
company
actively
opposing
it.
thus,
it
would
have
a
right
to
do.
i
think
what
is
more
probable,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so,
is
that
on
a
fresh
record
with
the
information
before
the
commission
of
the
great
pacific
intertie
with
the
southern
california,
with
the
canadian
entitlement
power
coming
in
with
the
projection
of
a
load
that
was
not
before
the
commission
then,
that
time,
the
secretary
as
mr.
solomon
said
was
urging
the
commission,
the
power
is
not
needed.
today,
the
reverse
is
true,
that
the
--
a
new
record
will
show
that
a
million
kilowatts
a
year
of
atomic
energy
plants
are
being
planned
for
the
northwest
because
hydro
won't
be
enough.
this
supply
system
has
built
and
is
operating
the
greatest
nuclear
power
plant
in
the
united
states,
800,000
kilowatts
in
partnership
with
bonneville
as
far
goes
into
the
bonneville
system.
and
we
think
that
given
opportunity,
the
commission
can
certainly
find
a
better
solution,
one
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act
then
dedicating
this
resource
to
exclusively
to
the
benefit
of
this
company.
and
consequently,
we
don't
think
that
necessarily,
it's
a
question
of
federal
power
versus
public
ownership,
local
public
ownership
or
federal
power
versus
entirely
against
a
private
company.
the
difficulty
with
this
case
is
that
it's
been
decided
upon
a
--
an
inadequate
record,
we
think
the
secretary's
right
in
his
objections
to
it
and
by
a
--
totally
ignoring
the
statutory
preference
to
public
agencies.
the
fact
is,
you'll
find
great
difficulty
in
discovering
in
this
record
the
public
power
application
for
a
license.
the
examiner
for
high
mountain
sheep,
the
examiner
denied
our
application
to
amend
our
nez
perce
application
to
substitute
high
mountain
sheep.
the
commission
overruled
it
--
reversed
it.
but
in
his
report
to
the
commission,
he
adhered
to
this.
he
said
the
amendments
should
not
be
allowed.
the
commission
in
its
final
opinion
reversed
them
again.
but
in
the
opinion,
it
granted
the
license
to
our
competitor
a
little
late
to
do
us
very
much
good.
what
we
were
committed
to
do
is
to
put
in,
in
bits
and
pieces
in
rebuttal
to
the
company's
case
our
objection
to
this
feature
of
their
project,
to
that
feature,
it
should
be
bigger,
a
1,200,000
kilowatts,
should
have
a
different
design.
and
our
rebuttal
evidence
scattered
to
the
record
is
all
we
have
to
point
to
as
an
application
because
the
examiner
excluded
it.
now,
we
think
upon
our
fresh
record
a
better
and
more
fair
result
will
be
obtained
and
one
more
to
the
public
interest.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
northcutt
ely
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
shall
not
have
time
to
cover
all
of
the
points
that
i
would
like
to
--
remaining,
now
i
should
like
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me,
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
had
our
application
for
a
license
on
the
high
mountain
sheep
been
granted?
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
would
have
excluded
the
granting
of
a
license
to
the
company
for
any
project
in
conflict
with
ours.
mr.
northcutt
ely
they
were
applying
for
exactly
the
same
site,
your
honor,
high
mountain
sheep.
if
you're
referring
to
the
earlier
context
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
in
which
the
–-
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
preliminary
permit,
we
did
not
have
a
preliminary
permit,
our
opponents
did.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
they
had
built
a
project,
had
the
commission
licensed
the
project
at
pleasant
valley,
the
high
dam
there,
this
would
have
been
in
conflict
with
the
--
any
project
that
high
mountain
sheep
or
nez
perce
and
it
would've
been
physically
impossible
thereafter
build
a
project
to
either
of
those
places,
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
why
should
one
application
be
exclusive
of
the
other
one?
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
statute
your
honor
in
section
7
(a),
directs
that
in
the
event
of
conflicting
applications
preference
shall
be
given
to
the
application
of
a
mini
state
or
a
municipality.
the
company
relies
upon
the
single
exception
to
that
preference
which
is
--
makes
the
preference
inoperative
where
a
preliminary
permit
has
been
issued.
they
will
--
they
say
that
the
permit
which
was
granted
to
them
for
the
pleasant
valley
project
shown
in
red
on
the
map
behind
me
gave
a
priority
which
displaced
an
old
--
our
preference
upon
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
upon
the
nez
perce
site
as
well
as
upon
the
sites
encompassed
by
the
permit.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
not
in
the
case
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
commission
below
declined
to
agree
with
them
this
--
the
commission
and
the
court
below
both
had
specifically
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
the
issue
before
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
whether
we
are
a
municipality.
the
issue
before
the
ninth
circuit
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
district
judge
to
the
effect
that
we
were
not
qualified
to
do
business
in
idaho
and
oregon,
not
upon
our
status
under
washington
law.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
if
that
question
is
ever
--
that
question
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
taken
off
the
docket
awaiting
the
decision
upon
this
review
of
the
commission's
decision.
now
on
remand
if
the
commission
decides
if
this
is
an
issue
which
contrary
to
this
court's
holdings
in
the
first
iowa
case
or
in
the
tacoma
case
does
mean
that
a
state
can
veto
a
federal
licensee,
done
that
as
a
matter
for
another
day
in
litigation.
it
is
not
right
for
litigation
now.
your
honor,
we
offered
a
--
pardon,
i
may
say
at
the
outset
that
we
claim
a
preference
which
the
court
below
said
was
clearly
applicable
in
the
absence
of
a
preliminary
permit.
we
have
offered
in
our
briefs
two
reasons
why
this
permit
is
not
applicable
at
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
one
is
the
reason
i
have
argued,
the
major
reason
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
by
the
language
of
the
permit,
it
never
did
apply
to
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
but
we
also
point
out
in
our
briefs
which
i
do
not
have
time
to
argue,
that
if
this
particular
permit
would
encompass
this
particular
site,
the
permit
was
a
dead
permit
by
the
time
the
license
application
was
filed.
and
i
should
like
to
simply
refer
to
the
points
in
the
brief
--
briefs
where
that
point
is
discussed.
this
is
point
number
eight
in
our
opening
brief,
beginning
at
page
53
where
we
give
in
some
detail
a
sequence
--
in
events
the
citations
of
the
record
and
is
covered
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
48
and
50.
pardon
me,
yesterday
mr.
solomon
indicated
--
they
told
the
court
quite
candidly
that
the
permit
did
indeed
as
a
matter
of
law
encompassed
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
the
nez
perce
site
--
may
i
have
the
blue
overlay.
the
permit
is
indicated
in
red
on
this
map,
these
are
the
areas
shown
in
the
notice
and
upon
the
face
of
a
permit.
what
you're
about
to
see
is
a
reproduction
of
the
information
on
the
maps
opposite
page
3
of
our
opening
brief.
and
this
shows
the
legal
consequences
of
mr.
solomon's
assertion
yesterday.
if
indeed
the
issuance
of
a
permit
in
1955
for
the
area
shown
in
red
mainly
for
the
low
mountain
sheep
and
pleasant
valley
dam
sites
did
as
a
matter
of
law
give
this
permitee
the
option,
the
right
to
transfer
this
priority
to
annul
as
of
the
date
of
issuance
of
that
permit.
the
high
mountain
sheep
and
the
nez
perce
da
--
site,
then
these
were
the
consequences
from
the
day
that
permit
issued
in
1955
describing
as
i
would
show
in
a
moment
by
metes
and
bounds
and
records
of
public
land
surveys
only
the
area
in
red.
the
permitee
got
without
ever
asking
for
it,
without
ever
giving
notice
to
anyone
and
without
the
permit
saying
--
so
on
its
face
these
rights,
the
exclusive
right
of
occupancy
for
three
years,
for
three
years
of
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
and
nez
perce
to
the
effect
that
he
got
the
exclusive
right
from
the
imnaha
river
and
the
exclusive
right
upon
the
salmon
river
up
to
the
freedom
dam
site,
these
are
the
areas
that
would
have
been
flooded
by
the
nez
perce
dam.
now
then
this
disclosure
of
the
permitee's
claim
was
not
made
until
the
last
day
the
three
years
of
the
permit.
on
the
day
it
expired,
he
filed
this
license
application
which
for
the
first
time,
disclosed
that
he
claimed
the
priority
for
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
we
are
now
told
and
that
as
a
candidate,
in
proper
admission
by
mr.
solomon
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
also
encompassed
the
nez
perce
dam
site,
it
didn't
encompass
high
mountain
sheep.
now
the
problem
is
transposing
this
issue
to
alaska
or
any
other
unknown
rivers
does
a
granting
of
a
permit
strictly
limited
to
a
specific
site,
give
the
permitee
that
kind
of
an
option.
no
one
can
know
from
reading
the
permit,
reading
the
application,
reading
the
map
that
a
company's
permit,
what
is
encompassed
by
that
permit?
yesterday
mr.
chief
justice
warren
asked
a
question
that
i
don't
think
was
answered
and
referring
to
the
dams
on
the
cascade
map
of
the
government.
this
i
believe
is
at
page
525
of
the
record
in
volume
2.
and
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
if
a
permit
had
been
issued
for
one
of
the
nine
dams
that
are
federal
dams
as
it
happens.
the
downstream
from
high
mountain
sheep
whether
the
permitee
would
have
got
the
option,
an
exclusive
right
on
all
nine,
the
answer
mr.
chief
justice
says
yes.
the
answer
however
depends
with
this
qualification
upon
the
permitee's
ingenuity,
engineering
ingenuity
in
designing
a
dam.
if
you'll
pick
out
again,
assume
we
transpose
this
problem
to
alaska,
the
yukon,
or
wherever
you
like,
we're
dealing
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
to
keep
these
names
of
dams
for
easy
identification
and
pick
out
the
fits,
the
middle
dam
of
the
nine.
if
we
refer
to
this
map,
then
this
means
that
a
permitee
for
that
dam
automatically
got
a
preemptive
option,
a
right
which
displace
the
public
preference
on
the
number
one
dam
upstream
even
though
his
plans,
his
designs,
his
notice
didn't
show
any
interference
because
of
the
relative
heights
of
the
dams,
because
he
read
the
right
to
increase
the
height
of
his
dam.
this
was
a
minor
modification,
a
right
that
needed
no
amendment
according
to
the
power
commission
council.
similarly
he
had
an
exclusive
option
upon
the
downstream
dams
even
though
if
you
look
at
the
map
at
page
525,
the
government's
cascade
series
of
maps.
it
would
appear
that
the
dams
downstream
could
have
no
interference,
no
relationships
to
the
middle
dam.
this
is
because
the
permitee
if
he
comes
in
and
says
“no,
i
have
found
a
way
to
build
a
dam
at
the
downstream
site,
site
number
nine,
downstream,
three
times
the
height
that
anyone
else
had
thought
of.
my
engineering
is
better.
i've
drilled
the
foundations.
then
that
dam
will
--
would
indeed
have
interfered
with
the
one
that
i
named
in
my
permit
then
because
they
are
mutually
exclusive,
because
they
would
interfere
with
each
other.
i
got
the
option
upon
that
downstream
site
too.
now
this
is
a
strange
way
to
interpret
a
right
in
a
navigable
stream.
mr.
solomon
said
yesterday
that
the
requirements
of
a
specificity
and
application
for
a
permit,
and
the
permit
itself
do
mean
that
you
must
apply
for
a
specific
project
and
you
must
describe
it.
but
the
reason
says
he
is
that
this
--
the
congress
was
concerned
about
excessive
land
withdrawals
under
section
24.
now,
mechanically
under
the
regulations,
the
withdrawal
under
section
24
as
established
by
the
commission
sending
to
the
secretary
of
interior
a
copy
of
its
notice
that
it
gave
to
public
agencies,
the
one
notice
handed
to
the
secretary
effects
ipso
facto,
a
withdrawal
of
the
public
lands
affected
by
that
project,
a
rare
instance
where
an
individual
by
filing
an
application
withdraws
the
lands
for
his
private
benefit.
the
carbon
copy
of
the
same
notice
sent
to
the
public
agencies
and
published
in
the
counties
where
the
project
lies,
do
not
have
this
effect
according
to
the
counsel
for
the
commission.
the
lands
that
are
covered
by
the
notice
of
the
secretary
are
indeed
withdrawn
and
no
other
lands
are
withdrawn
but
the
notice
of
public
agencies
does
not
have
a
meaning
on
the
face
of
the
permit.
it
is
not
limited
in
the
withdrawal
against
the
preference
right
under
section
7
(a)
to
the
lands
the
power
sites
described.
it
extends
up
and
down
the
river
to
all
competing
sites.
now
the
question
of
a
notice
to
which
i
have
referred,
i
should
like
to
simply
say
here
what
i
say
at
page
29
of
my
opening
brief,
the
question
is
not
whether
the
issuance
of
a
permit
or
receive
a
notice
of
an
application
puts
everyone
on
notice
that
the
permitee
hopes
to
build
a
project
and
that
if
he
does,
this
will
foreclose
the
development
of
competing
projects.
and
the
question
is
not
whether
the
municipality
learns
somehow
of
what
is
going
on
after
that
permit
issues.
it's
too
late.
his
preference
right
upon
the
competing
site,
high
mountain
sheep
and
nez
perce
was
killed
off
the
day
that
permit
issued
and
can
never
be
revived
while
that
permit
is
alive.
the
question
is
whether
the
commission's
issuance
of
a
statutory
notice
to
public
agencies
of
a
permit
application
for
a
specific
site
on
a
navigable
stream
puts
them
on
notice
that
a
permitee
is
to
get
an
affirmative
priority
upon
all
other
sites
in
competition
with
those
that
he
has
preempted.
now
to
translate
this
to
any
other
field
of
a
public
land
and
navigable
streams
laws
of
which
the
court
is
familiar,
this
means
that
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
enacted
by
the
same
congress
in
1920,
if
you
apply
for
a
prospecting
permit
on
the
public
lands,
they're
good
for
a
limited
time
just
as
these
permits
were
described
in
specific
areas,
just
as
this
permit
did.
and
if
you
drill
your
well
four
miles
outside
the
boundaries
of
your
permit
which
is
the
distance
of
high
mountain
sheep
was
from
the
nearest
boundary
of
this
permit
and
affect
the
discovery
that
somehow
you
have
acquired
under
the
1920
mineral
leasing
act
a
right
to
a
lease.
now
congress
never
before
has
granted
any
options,
any
floating
easements
upon
either
the
public
lands
or
this
--
the
navigable
streams
of
the
united
states.
and
it
did
not
intend
we
say
to
disable
and
cripple
the
public
preference
who
have
carefully
made
mandatory
in
the
legislative
history
by
giving
the
permitee
this
option
to
roam
to
transfer
his
priorities.
reference
was
made
yesterday
to
the
legislative
history
and
again
this
morning.
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
rather
careful
review
of
the
legislative
history
in
appendix
c
to
my
opening
brief,
this
is
at
page
19a.
and
on
the
specific
point
that
has
made
this
morning
and
yesterday
as
to
whether
this
priority
of
preference
agencies
must
be
asserted
at
the
permit
stage.
congress
specifically
took
up
this
proposal
by
utility
spokesman
and
did
not
adopt
it.
instead,
it
adopted
language
that
preserved
the
preference
for
assertion
either
at
the
permit
stage
or
three
years
later
at
the
licensing
stage.
and
it
specifically
made
it
clear
--
pardon
me,
i
should
give
you
the
citations
of
this.
this
point
is
covered
in
our
reply
brief
under
my
heading
number
6
beginning
to
page
29.
congress
refused
to
limit
their
preference
to
the
permit
stage.
it
preserved
it
to
the
licensing
stage.
why
should
a
public
agency
interested
in
the
high
mountain
sheep
or
nez
perce
be
forced
to
come
in
with
a
preemptive
permit
application
because
it
receives
a
notice
of
an
application
for
the
project
which
it
feels
is
worthless
and
is
not
going
to
get
a
license
which
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
now
bear
in
mind
that
under
section
7
(a),
a
public
agency
fairly
warned,
fairly
warned,
can
wipe
the
(inaudible)
clean
of
the
competing
permit
application
of
the
company
instantly
by
filing
a
preemptive
permit
application
of
its
own.
there's
no
conditions
to
that,
whatever.
if
the
state
of
washington
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
section
7
(a)
is
the
statute
time
relying
upon.
and
that
section
says
in
terms
that
a
public
agency
shall
have
preference
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
to
the
public
agency,
the
state
or
municipality,
the
language
of
the
statute
is,
in
issuing
preliminary
permits
hereunder
or
licenses
where
no
preliminary
permit
has
been
issued
the
commission
shall
give
preference
to
applications
therefore
by
states
and
municipalities.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
refrain
--
let
me
divide
this
into
two
parts.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
your
question
refers
to
the
permit
stage
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
a
permit
application
notice
fairly
discloses
what
the
company
asks,
and
if
a
public
agency
responding
to
that
notice
files
a
competing
application
for
a
permit,
the
mandate
is
flapped.
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
gets
the
permit
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
about
that
in
our
legislative
history.
that's
its
purpose.
the
problem
arises
that
if
the
company
gets
the
permit
as
it
did
here
on
the
phase
of
a
notice
restricting
the
application
to
a
project
in
which
we
had
no
interest.
then
three
years
later,
as
it
did
here
on
the
last
day
of
the
permit
say
we
changed
our
minds
now.
we
now
claim
under
that
permit
projects
that
we
disclaimed
when
we
asked
for
the
permit
the
question
is
now
whether
at
the
licensing
stage
our
preference
has
survived
so
that
we
may
assert
that
preference
against
the
project
excluded
on
the
day
the
permit
was
applied
for
but
now
purportedly
included
on
the
day
that
the
company
applies
for
a
license
on
the
new
project.
mr.
northcutt
ely
because
the
public
agencies
of
the
northwest
had
confidence
that
the
application
for
the
pleasant
valley
project
would
be
rejected
as
an
inferior
project
and
it
was
rejected.
the
commission
turned
it
down.
we're
under
no
necessity
to
come
in
with
the
elaborate
engineering
and
the
expense
of
filing
a
prematurely,
a
competing
application
on
some
other
site
when
the
one
being
applied
for
on
its
phase
didn't
deserve
a
license.
they
took
the
gamble
properly
that
the
commission
would
reject
that
application
and
it
did.
now
the
question,
one
of
the
questions
in
the
cases,
did
the
permit
survive
the
rejection
of
that
license
application?
it
was
rejected
on
grounds
which
we
say
precluded
its
reassertion
on
the
high
mountain
sheep
site.
and
indeed
the
company
asked
for
time
to
substitute
the
high
mountain
sheep
site
to
make
new
investigations.
the
commission
denied
this
application
on
rehearing.
but
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
pleasant
valley
was
within
the
red
area,
within
the
announced
boundaries
of
their
permit.
no
question
about
that.
and
the
question
is
whether
they
got
an
extra
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
on
that
site
because
it
was
within
the
boundaries
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
of
the
notice.
now
may
i
just
point
out
in
the
record
where
you'll
find
some
of
the
things
to
which
i
have
referred
here.
first
i
should
say
now
but
i'm
sure
the
court
realizes
that
this
was
a
three
to
two
decision
by
the
federal
power
commission
dissent
on
the
original
opinion
filed
by
chairman
swidler
joined
by
vice
chairman
black
on
rehearing
assigned
by
vice
chairman
black
joined
by
swidler.
these
are
powerful
dissents
and
they
appear
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
687
as
it
refers
to
the
comments
which
i'd
like
to
refer.
yesterday
a
great
deal
was
made
of
the
commission's
intent
to
deal
fairly
and
of
course
it
does
intend
to
deal
fairly.
but
two
members
of
the
commission
thought
the
result
here
was
grotesquely
unfair
and
it
was
a
distortion
of
a
statute.
and
mrs.
chairman
swidler
at
page
701
of
the
record,
the
majority's
position
is
unreasonable
because
of
the
inadequate
notice.
indeed
the
wholly
false
and
misleading
notice
provided
by
a
preliminary
permit
under
this
interpretation
and
the
resulting
failure
to
get
potential
competing
applicants
and
other
interested
parties,
the
statutory
notice
to
which
they
are
entitled.
and
he
said
at
page
701
the
majority
position
is
mystifying
because
it
interprets
a
permit
application
as
meeting
something
other
than
what
it
says
whereas
to
some
compelling
reason
of
congressional
purpose
advanced
in
support
of
this
transmutation
i
might
be
persuaded
but
no
reason
is
given.
now,
i'd
like
to
ask
your
attention
to
the
particular
permit
application
and
the
map
which
a
company
did.
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
never
in
a
contested
case,
your
honor.
there
had
been
a
number
of
uncontested
cases
in
which
as
a
matter
of
internal
housekeeping.
the
commission
has
sometimes
required
amendments,
other
times
rejected
them.
but
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
this
is
the
first
time
there's
been
a
coalition
between
a
preference
claim
and
a
claim
of
priority
under
a
permit.
as
chairman
swidler
says,
this
is
a
benchmark
case
that
in
which
the
commission
gives
vast
and
sweeping
effect
to
the
priority
of
permit
and
on
unjustifiably
restricts
the
preference
congress
intended
for
public
agencies.
mr.
northcutt
ely
applied
for
a
license.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
this
was
in
1960,
about
five
months
after
we
received
a
notice
of
license
application
by
the
company
upon
high
mountain
sheep.
while
a
file
pro
forma
application
on
march
31,
1958
accompanied
by
maps
of
the
rejected
dams,
it
filed
finally
18
months
later
the
papers
you
now
have
before
you
and
then
the
commission
gave
notice.
and
then
within
five
months
after
that
we
filed
our
application.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
this
priority
issue
was
muted
at
that
time.
it
was
really
--
came
in
rather
later
if
i
may
say
so.
the
notion
that
this
permit
did
indeed
give
them
priority
was
a
very
touchy
one.
they
filed
a
petition
for
that.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
i
don't
think
it
had
occurred
to
anybody
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
that
the
permit
in
fact
gave
a
priority
on
nez
perce.
the
first
time
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir
that's
--
and
mr.
solomon
is
correct.
if
the
priority
extended
by
extra
laterally
beyond
the
permit
to
encompass
high
mountain
sheep
it
did
indeed
include
nez
perce.
but
we
never
heard
of
that
at
the
time.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
we
--
well,
yes
by
the
examiner.
we
did
not
push
it
after
it
became
apparent
that
the
fishery
problems
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
we
sought
to
it,
the
examiner
denied
the
--
our
privilege.
the
commission
finally
affirmed
it
on
their
final
opinion
to
substitute
high
mountain
sheep.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
he
did
not
feel
that
public
power
had
any
right
to
come
in
with
this
late
in
the
day
and
move
to
amend
to
substitute
high
mountain
sheep.
he
was
just
anti
and
the
commission
overruled
it,
but
too
late
to
do
as
much
good,
the
case
was
over
by
that
time.
i
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
are
called
a
joint
operate
--
joint
operating
agency
created
by
a
statute
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
justice
douglas,
this
is
a
response
to
your
question,
i
understand
mr.
justice
black.
the
washington
public
power
supply
system
is
created
as
a
joint
operating
agency
under
a
statute
of
the
state
of
washington
that
authorizes
public
utility
districts
to
exercise
their
powers
jointly.
we
are
also
a
successor
by
act
of
the
washington
legislature
to
the
washington
power
commission
which
it
had
been
set
up
initially
to
do
this
kind
of
a
job
to
build
great
projects
perhaps
outside
the
state's
boundaries.
the
joint
operating
agency
is
a
--
as
a
subsequent
creation
device
of
the
washington
legislature
described
as
a
municipality
by
the
washington
statute,
by
the
commission,
and
by
the
court
below.
it
is
a
municipal
corporation
comprised
of
16
public
utility
districts
within
the
state
of
washington
exercising
their
joint
powers
in
this
way.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right.
to
do
what
is
beyond
the
financial
powers
or
anyone
of
them
alone.
mr.
northcutt
ely
in
a
broad
sense,
yes,
they
are
locally
created,
locally
managed
by
board
of
three
elected
officers
within
each
county.
and
they
build
and
operate
projects.
the
state
of
washington
is
unique
in
this
form
of
organization.
about
half
of
the
population
of
washington
is
served
by
the
16
public
utility
districts
who
are
here
exercising
their
joint
powers.
before
i
leave,
may
i
say
i
haven't
said
anything
about
the
fish
because
the
fish
to
my
mind
are
indeed
a
red
herring
here,
this
subject
is
covered
in
my
reply
brief.
