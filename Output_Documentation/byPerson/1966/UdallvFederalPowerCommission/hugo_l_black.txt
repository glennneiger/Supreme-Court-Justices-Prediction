was

justice
hugo
l.
black
was
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
agreement
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
they
have
to
show
that?
i'm
just
asking
you
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
that
the
other
company
had
shown,
that
is
what
i
meant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
was
it
to
the
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
was
it
from
high
mountain
sheep?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
that
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
meant,
“the
reach
of
the
river”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
a
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
practically
in
thought,
i
am
not
familiar
with
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
three
and
a
half
to
four
miles
apart,
suppose
the
public
agency
had
filed
one
for
the
nez
perce
here
and
then
the
one,
the
three
and
a
half
to
four
miles
below
there
was
claimed
by
somebody
else.
both
of
them
would
have
a
pretty
far
reach
as
to
whom
(inaudible)
what
they
did.
but
could
the
commission
if
it
desired,
give
that
to
either
one
or
must
it
necessarily
restrict
itself
giving
to
the
one
that
had
filed
at
nez
perce,
nez
perce
and
then
deny
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
does
the
commission
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
take
the
position
that
they
need
not
initiate
any
movement
under
7
(b)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
do
it
automatically
in
granting
it
to
a
private
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
expressed
provision
in
the
act
which
provides
the
commission
shall
presume
in
favor
of
the
private
company
if
there
was
no
opposition
by
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
section
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you're
relying
on
section
7
(b)
only?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
--
i'm
trying
the
others
from
your
brief
you
claimed
that
the
only
question
presented
or
raised
are
issue
to
be
decided
in
this
appeal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
on
his
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
first
when
section
7
was
written
in
the
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
who
put
on
the
evidence
that
makes
them
valuable
to
federal
development?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
we
may
assume
that
the
applicant
didn't
put
on
--
they
were
not
anxious
to
put
on
evidence
to
show
the
advantages
of
federal
development.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
is
a
kind
of
an
issue
of
policy,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
7
say,
does
it
say
you're
going
to
measure
it
by
physical
capacity
to
do
some
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
raises
many
questions
that
might
not
depend
at
all
to
what
have
you
been
talking
about
here,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
commission
decide
that
because
the
eight
and
nine
whether
that
regard
to
a
contract
to
cooperate
it,
it'd
be
better
for
the
government
to
do
it
in
order
to
have
all
of
it
under
one
management
that
there
could
be
no
possible
lawsuit
or
contest
of
any
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
he
doesn't
raise
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
don't
have
to
wait,
they
don't
have
to
wait,
do
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
considering
all
the
circum
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
considering
all
the
circumstances,
everything
in
connection
with
it
other
than
--
and
that
judgment
if
better,
they
say
the
federal
government
should
undertake
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
a
little
difficult
to
narrow
that
down
to
pass
it
to
physically
operate
it,
as
you've
been
doing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
--
i
haven't
read
his
brief
and
i
didn't
hold
that
was
his
argument
but
that
what's
--
what
appeared
to
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
before
you
start?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
application
has
been
granted
and
the
other
one
had
been
denied,
could
they
then
have
gotten
a
new
dam
at
the
point
they
wanted
it?
or
would
that
have
excluded
any
other
dam
at
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
have
been
in
conflict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
earlier
one
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
one
covered
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
true,
why
should
one
be
exclusive
of
the
other,
if
they
are
there
at
the
same
time
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
by
priority.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
explain
--
will
you
explain
exactly
what
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
it
works.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
shall
have
preference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
if
a
private
agency
applies
to
in
proper
form
under
7,
thereafter
a
municipality
appear
--
applies
that
the
preference
to
the
municipality
overcomes
the
preference,
if
there
are
a
preference
of
the
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
then
that
the
municipality
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
the
company
applied
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
say
that
you
had
no
interest
in
the
one
the
company
applied
for
if
it
was
one
that
would
exclude
you
from
getting
the
one
that's
close
by
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
it's
not
material
yet
on
--
is
that
it,
on
your
viewpoint
that
--
justice
douglas
have
asked
you
several
times
about
whether
your
company
was
a
municipality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
what
kind
of
company
is
yours?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
joint
effort
on
the
part
of
municipality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
take
advantage
of
the
preference
provisions
of
the
act.
justice

these
