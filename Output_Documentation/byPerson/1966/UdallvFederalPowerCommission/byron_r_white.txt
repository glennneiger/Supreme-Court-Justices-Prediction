justice

we're
dealing
here
with
idaho,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
25%
of
fish
that
reached
that
dam
site
would
not
go
up
for
salmon,
they
would
go
on
up
the
snake
and
the
--
the
imnaha.
justice
byron

white
no,
no,
no
their
approved
procedures
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
sec
--
the
secretary's
position
of
the
dam
should
be
built
by
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
some
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
what
if
the
--
what
--
what
should
the
commission
do
if
--
if
in
the
process
of
the
passing
of
a
license,
it
picks
as
a
federal
alternative
but
then
that
is
convinced
that
the
federal
alternative
would
be
long
delayed
or
if
the
secretary
comes
in
and
speaks
of
this
matter
but
has
no
plan
whatsoever
for
the
department
of
interior
to
go
forward
with
the
federal
project.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
says
we
don't
think
there
should
be
any
project
but
the
commission
is
convinced
that
a)
there
should
be
a
project,
and
b)
it
should
go
forward
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that
position
is
that
if
the
commission
believes
the
project
should
go
forward,
it
must
also
consider
whether
it
should
--
it
would
be
better
to
have
a
go
forward
under
federal
laws.
if
it
does
decide
that
then
it
has
to
report
it
to
the
congress
and
wait.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
commission
is
considering
it's
alternatives
in
making
its
judgment
must
assume
that
the
federal
government
will
go
ahead
and
--
and
then
make
the
comparison
as
to
which
development
would
be
better.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
does
it
apply
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
could
they
express
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
he
expressed
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
right
in
this
case
that
these
important
statements
of
any
words
or
phrase
or
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
imposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
tes
--
the
proposed
testimony
of
those
witnesses
who
were
called
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
any
event
would
they,
was
that
testimony
then
consistent
with
the
secretary's
position
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
that
there
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
the
federal
power
commission
conducted
its
own
proving,
investigation
and
that
it
knows
that
there
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
do
you
--
do
you
think
the
trial
examiner
for
example
use
to
go
on
the
standard
under
section
7
(b),
under
7
that
in
saying
that
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
private
applicant
would
develop
all
the
benefits
as
well
as
the
federal
government,
is
that
the
right
standard
under
7?
now,
let's
forget
about
whether
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
or
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
or
anything
like
that.
is
that
the
right
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
the
one
that
was
stated
in
chapman.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
determining
that
you
decide
you
compare
the
advantages.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
the
private
--
and
that
can
do
it
as
well
as
the
government
and
there's
no
reason
for
federal
development,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
here,
the
examiner
purported
they've
been
through
all
the
factors
of
power,
flood
control,
fish
and
he
made
his
assessment
that
in
the
case
of
none
of
these
factors
was
the
federal
alternatives
superior,
the
private
development
could
do
the
--
obtain
these
benefits
as
well
as
the
federal
government.
now,
you're
saying
about
those
conclusions
that
are
drawn
on
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
ask
you
what
your
position
was
on
whether
the
federal
government
to
do
it
better
or
not,
yes,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
you
don't
know.
so
there
hasn't
been
any
investigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that
--
that
element,
the
hearing
examiners
took
it
to
consider
and
the
commission
considered
and
the
--
you
say
it
ought
to
be
dealt
with
by
expert
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
--
doesn't
that
lie
right
in
the
heart
of
the
commission's
expertise
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has,
it
purports
to
have
done
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
--
they've
just
done
it
and
you
say
that
they
--
that
they
need
some
more
evidence
to
do
the
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
--
you
don't
--
the
commission
just
didn't
affirm
the
trial
examiner's
position
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
--
well,
i
just
don't
read
it
that
way
but
i
get
--
so
that
i
get
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron

white
well,
that
they
--
that
they
had
priority
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
it
is
to
mend
the
drafts.
justice
