mr.
amos
m.
mathews
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
brought
this
action
in
united
states
district
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
a
chicago
ordinance
is
invalid
on
its
face,
a
reason
of
conflict
with
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
city
and
the
other
respondents
who
are
officials
of
the
city
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
the
district
court
dismissed
in
response
to
that
motion
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
some
of
the
issues
in
this
case
were
presented
to
this
court
are
issues
similar
to
those
in
this
case,
were
presented
to
this
court
in
1958
in
chicago
against
atchison,
topeka,
and
santa
fe
railway
company,
357
u.s.77.
in
order
to
understand
the
issues
in
this
instant
case,
it
is
necessary
to
refer
very
briefly
to
some
of
the
facts
in
that
earlier
litigation.
petitioner
is
engaged
under
a
contract
with
the
chicago
railroads
in
transferring
passengers
between
railroad
stations
in
chicago.
it
frequently
happens
that
a
passenger
engaged
on
a
through
journey
through
chicago
must
transfer
from
his
incoming
to
his
outgoing
railroad
station.
the
petitioner
furnishes
that
service
in
specially
designed
buses.
the
petitioner
receives
ultimate
remuneration
from
the
railroads
that
passenger
pays
nothing
to
petitioner.
prior
to
1955,
this
interstation
transfer
service
had
been
performed
for
many
years
by
the
parmelee
transportation
company.
during
the
time
that
parmelee
performed
the
service,
the
service
was
regulated
by
the
city
of
chicago
along
with
taxicab
service
and
other
similar
services
by
what
is
known
as
chapter
28
of
the
municipal
code
of
chicago.
on
june
--
in
june
of
1955,
the
railroads
notified
parmelee
that
as
of
october
1
of
that
year,
they
would
discontinue
using
parmelee
service
and
would
use
petitioner
instead.
about
a
month
later
in
july
of
1955,
the
city
council
of
chicago
passed
an
amendment
to
chapter
28
that
i've
already
mentioned,
that
imposed
two
very
serious
obstacles
or
barricades
to
petitioner
and
the
railroads
in
their
expectation
of
launching
the
new
service.
in
the
first
place
the
amendment
gave
what
amounted
due
a
perpetual
franchise
to
parmelee
to
perform
the
service.
secondly,
it
provided
that
a
newcomer
to
the
field,
such
as
petitioner,
must
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
of
the
city
of
chicago
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
the
new
service.
this
court
in
the
atchison
case
that
i've
mentioned
held
the
amendment
to
chapter
28
invalid
because
in
conflict
with
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i'd
like
to
mention
briefly
here
that
the
evidence
shows
in
that
earlier
case
and
it
is
set
out
both
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
this
court
affirmed,
that
this
action
of
the
chicago
city
council
in
amending
chapter
28
as
i've
said,
was
a
well-planned,
well-conceived
scheme
to
keep
--
to
perpetuate
parmelee
in
the
service
and
to
keep
--
and
to
put
petitioner
out
of
business.
after
the
decision
of
this
case
in
the
atchison
--
after
the
decision
in
the
atchison
case
by
this
court
in
1958,
that
restored
the
status
quo
regulatory
wise
that
had
prevailed
as
to
this
interstation
transfer
service
before
the
1955
amendment.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
leave
regulation
or
have
regulation
of
the
same
type
that
had
covered
parmelee
for
many
years,
all
the
city
of
council
had
to
do
was
simply
do
nothing.
but
shortly
after
--
a
few
months
after
the
mandate
came
down
in
the
former
atchison
case,
the
chicago
city
council
started
on
a
course
of
amendment
of
chapter
28
again
to
the
great
detriment
of
petitioner
and
the
chicago
railroad.
the
council
amended
chapter
--
section
28-6
of
chapter
28
by
requiring
that
annually
a
person
desiring
a
license
to
operate
as
a
public
passenger
vehicle
must
file
an
application
with
the
--
well,
they
already
had
to
file
an
application
but
it
amended
those
application
proceedings
to
provide
that
a
person
filing
an
application
must
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
that
the
applicant
was
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
cabman
or
a
coachman.
now
that
phrase
qualified
to
pursue
the
application
of
a
cabman
or
a
coachman
included
petitioner
within
its
scope
because
petitioner
was
defined
as
a
coachman
in
the
ordinance.
it
also
included
taxicabs
for
the
most
part
but
taxicabs
operators
already
had
to
prove
that
they
--
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
before
conducting
any
operation
since
they
were
an
intrastate
operation,
presumably
that
was
valid,
at
least
it's
never
been
challenged
as
to
the
taxicabs.
in
other
words,
this
amendment
in
1959
to
section
28-6
the
--
almost
the
entire
force
of
it
fell
up
on
the
petitioner.
this
phrase
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
coachman
was
not
in
any
sense,
could
not
--
cannot
in
any
sense,
we
submit,
be
considered
a
regulation
within
the
legitimate
police
power.
it
gave
a
discretion
to
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
to
--
in
his
discretion,
deny
the
application
for
a
certificate
to
perform
this
service.
and
so
we
say
that
--
and
we
cited
the
only
case
we
can
find
on
the
point,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
that
the
phrase
“qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation”
is
a
--
in
substance
a
part
of
the
proof
that
has
to
be
made
in
proving
public
convenience
and
necessity.
so
the
chicago
city
council
got
back
on
the
old
--
in
1959,
got
back
on
the
old
1955
track.
the
council
amended
another
section,
section
28-31
of
chapter
28
required
taxicab
operators
to
furnish
annually
to
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
a
detailed
financial
statement
showing
profit
and
loss
and
all
of
the
detailed
information
that
and
of
a
--
an
intrastate
operator
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
city
council
would
need
to
submit
for
the
purpose
of
rate
regulation.
but
the
council
by
a
very
clear
and
direct
amendment
to
that
provision
required
or
made
that
provision
applicable
to
petitioner.
in
other
words,
it's
something
that
the
petitioner
whose
sole
responsibility
as
to
the
railroads
to
--
it's
furnishing
the
same
kind
of
financial
data
to
the
commissioner
as
taxicab
operators.
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no.
no
sir.
well,
the
--
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i'm
coming
to
something
now
that
i
think
might
answer
your
question.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
in
part
anyway.
and
i'll
cover
that
exclusively
after
i
reached
this
point.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
respondents
now
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
in
this
court,
concede
that
these
two
provisions,
these
two
amendments
that
i've
detailed
cannot
be
applied
to
petitioner.
now
they
did
not
make
that
concession
in
their
brief
opposing
certiorari.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
made
the
same
argument
in
respect
to
these
two
amendments
that
we
now
make
in
our
petition
--
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
and
that
i
have
outlined
briefly
in
argument
here.
so
--
but
for
the
first
time
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
respondents
say
that
these
two
provisions
cannot
be
enforced
against
petitioner.
now
either
that
concession
means
that
the
amendments
are
not
applicable
in
terms
to
petitioner
or
it
means
that
they
cannot
lawfully
be
applied
to
petitioner.
now
we
submit
that
the
two
amendments
are
just
as
clearly
and
precisely
applicable
to
petitioner
in
their
wording
as
an
arrow
hitting
a
bull's
eye.
therefore
we
say
that
this
concession
must
mean
that
respondents
are
admitting
that
these
two
amendments
are
invalid
on
their
face
as
applied
to
petitioner.
now
answering
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
we
have
spelled
this
out
in
detail
in
our
brief
but
i
think
i
can
summarize
it
quite
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
expeditiously.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
correct.
but
i
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
this
was
the
one,
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
section
regarding
financial
statements
by
taxicab
operators
was
made
in
terms
to
apply
to
taxicab
operators.
among
the
definitions
in
chapter
28,
are
these.
a
person
is
defined
as
an
individual,
a
firm,
or
a
corporation,
so
that
before
the
amendment
i'm
referring
to
the
taxicab
amendment
--
the
taxicab
financial
statement
provision
applied
to
taxicab
operators
who
either
were
individuals
or
partnerships,
or
corporations.
it
applied
that
plainly.
now
the
city
council
in
bringing
parmelee
--
bringing
petitioner
within
the
scope
of
that
amendment,
used
the
word
and
made
it
applicable
to
every
corporation
that
is
a
public
passenger
vehicle.
now,
petitioner
is
a
corporation,
petitioner
is
a
public
passenger
vehicle.
so
the
language
could
not
be
any
clearer,
we
submit.
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
was
--
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
first
--
the
case
has
been
to
the
court
of
appeals
twice.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
was
amend
--
it
was
before
the
last
argument
in
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
requirement
to
furnish
financial
data
or
words
to
that
effect
is
within
the
ul
--
the
legitimate
police
power
of
the
city.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
too
for
that
matter
held
the
ordinance
was
valid
on
its
face
and
they
held
that
the
city
had
taken
no
action
of
which
petitioner
could
complain.
we
submit
that
this
concession
amounts
to
an
admission
that
in
these
two
respects,
the
ordinance
is
invalid
on
its
face.
therefore,
we
submit
there
is
a
conflict
between
these
concessions
and
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
therefore,
we
further
submit
that
in
view
of
that,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
vacated
or
reversed
in
order
that
a
judgment
maybe
entered
in
the
district
court
in
accordance
with
the
concession
now
made
in
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
not
entirely,
there
are
two
other
points
that
--
in
which
they
have
not
made
concessions,
or
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
those
other
two
points?
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
i
was
about
to
go
to
those.
there
are
two
other
points.
the
ordinance
was
--
the
ordinance
requires
in
effect
and
there
is
some
dispute
about
this
that
a
petitioner
--
any
operator
of
a
public
vehicle
be
required
to
employ
as
chauffeurs
only
residents
of
the
city
of
chicago.
now
there
is
some
dispute
about
that
as
to
whether
that
is
before
the
court.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
was
in
the
pleadings,
it
was
the
court
--
the
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
with
before
the
court
and
both
of
them
decided
it.
and
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
decided
that
it
is
a
valid
--
within
the
police
power
of
the
city
of
chicago
to
compel
the
petitioner
to
employ
as
chauffeurs
only
residents
of
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
well
at
least
--
yes
sir,
that's
my
understanding.
the
other
provision
is
this
and
it
came
in
by
an
amendment.
the
ordinance
was
amended
after
the
first
atchison
case
to
require
that
every
public
passenger
vehicle
operator
must
maintain
--
if
a
corporation,
must
maintain
its
principal
place
of
business
in
chicago.
now
petitioner
has
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
an
invalid
requirement
under
the
commerce
clause
and
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
far
as
petitioner
is
concerned
to
say
that
a
corporation
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
in
chicago
must
maintain
its
principal
place
of
business
there.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
this
petitioner's
(inaudible)
it's
only
place
of
business
is
in
chicago.
but
it
is
our
position
on
that,
your
honor,
that
at
some
time
in
the
future,
we
may
want
to
move
our
principal
place
of
business
somewhere
else
without
ceasing
to
do
business
in
chicago.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
i'm
--
i
--
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
we
believe
there
is
in
this
way.
we
have
encountered
at
times
and
we
encountered
it
in
this
case
in
fact,
it's
raised
in
respondent's
brief,
in
respect
to
section
28-6.
in
respect
to
28-6
that
was
amended
to
include
that
qualification
provision,
despite
the
fact
that
that
amendment
was
in
section
28-6,
they
say
that
since
we
didn't
attack
section
28-6
in
earlier
litigation
that
section
26
--
its
28-6
is
valid
on
the
principle
of
res
judicata
or
at
least
the
way
i
understand
that
argument.
now
when
the
time
comes,
if
it
comes,
when
we
want
to
move
our
principal
place
of
business,
we
don't
want
to
be
met
with
an
argument
that
the
question
res
judicata
because
we
didn't
raise
it
in
this
action.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
be
perfectly
frank
if
this
court
should
want
to
say
that
it
isn't
--
it
wasn't
--
isn't
timely
raised,
it
can't
be
raised
now
with
adversary
purpose
just
as
well,
because
we
wouldn't
be
met
with
the
defense
of
res
judicata.
the
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
correct,
if
--
well
--
it
--
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
we'd
want
it,
i
--
yes,
yes,
sir.
we
would
want
you
to
make
--
the
court
to
make
clear
that
we
raised
it
but
we
wouldn't
object
if
the
court
said
that
if
it
wasn't
ripe
for
consideration,
yet.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
because
in
that
way,
that
would
avoid
the
defense
of
res
judicata.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
a
great
deal
of
the
argument
of
the
respondents
is
to
the
effect
that
the
city
has
done
nothing
to
hurt
us.
but
frankly,
we
submit
and
we
believe
that
the
city
is
trying
to
play
the
same
cat
and
mouse
game
with
us
in
this
case
that
they
tried
to
play
in
the
former
atchison
case.
in
the
atchison
case
is
the
opinion
of
the
--
the
opinion
of
this
court
reveals.
the
city
said
the
--
disclaimed
any
intention
to
use
the
phrase
“public
convenience
and
necessity”
as
an
economic
barrier
to
our
operation.
they
said
that
only
compromises
the
reasonable
incidence
of
the
police
power.
and
this
court
disposed
of
that
by
saying
it's
perfectly
clear
whatever
language
you
apply
to
it
that
the
city
is
still
claiming
some
power
to
exclude
or
hamper
petitioner's
operations.
now
there's
a
rather
curious
inconsistency.
well,
i'll
leave
out
the
adjective
and
say
it's
an
inconsistency
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this.
that
in
a
footnote
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
says
that
respondents
now
admit
that
they
have
no
power
to
stop
petitioner's
operations.
but
right
on
the
same
page
and
not
in
the
footnote,
is
this
statement
--
well
anyway,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
finds
that
the
ordinance
confers
the
power
on
the
public
and
vehicle
--
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
to
deny
an
application.
in
other
words,
after
holding
in
the
body
of
its
opinion
that
the
ordinance
gives
the
city
that
power
and
thus
as
we
say
shows
that
the
ordinance
is
invalid
on
its
face,
the
court
in
a
footnote
says
that
the
city
admits
that
it
has
no
power
to
stop
petitioner's
operations.
the
--
we
think
that
in
view
of
that
omission
--
admission
by
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
we
admit
that
it
has
to
have
some
kind
of
a
chauffeur's
license.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
under
some
circumstances,
under
the
police
power.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
but
they
--
we
say
that
they
can
base
the
--
they
can't
say
--
they
can
say
to
us,
“your
chauffeurs
must
have
licenses
as
chauffeurs,
driver
or
a
chauffeur's
license”.
but
we
say
that
they
can't
make
the
criterion
for
that
residence
in
chicago,
that
you
must
be
a
--
the
licensee
must
be
a
resident
in
chicago.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
there
are
circumstances
within
the
police
power
but
we
think
that
the
phrase
used
that
he
must
prove
he's
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
transferring
passengers
between
stations,
gives
the
city
the
right
to
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
exercise
an
economic
power.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh
well,
but
there
are
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
this
is
an
addition
to
all
of
those
others.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
and
it
is
not
a
sum
--
it
is
not
a
summarization
of
them.
if
you
examine
the
structure
of
the
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
right.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
right.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
because
the
city
--
because
--
two
answers
to
that,
because
of
our
past
experience
with
the
city
of
deliberately
trying
to
put
us
out
of
business
and
we
think
this
is
another
attempt
along
the
same
line.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
we've
had
licenses
in
the
first
year
which
we
obtained
under
the
rest.
and
since
then,
we've
been
depositing
the
license
fee
without
obtaining
licenses
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
the
district
court.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
they
have
not.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
but
someday,
we
think
they
will
under
critical
times.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
now
the
point
is
we
don't
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
those
circumstances
are
spelled
out
in
the
ordinance
and
we
don't
attack
them.
but
to
superimpose
this
discretionary
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation.
the
only
two
cases
we
can
find
on
that
that
used
that
language
say
unreserved
a
bit
that
that
gives
a
discretion
beyond
ordinary
police
power
qualifications.
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
can
just
a
few
minutes
i
have
left
for
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
i
want
to
refer
very
briefly
to
the
concession
that
i
mentioned
in
my
argument
and
i
want
to
read
them
or
the
part
of
them.
on
page
16
of
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits,
“the
city
specifically
denied
that
transfer
must
prove
annually
that
it
is
qualified”.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
city
specifically
denied
that
transfer
must
prove
annually
that
it
is
qualified.
well,
now
what
we
say,
as
i
said
before
the
--
in
as
much
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
valid,
that
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
to
affirm
a
legal
situation
that
the
city
now
concedes
--
cannot
be
applied
to
petitioner.
then
in
respect
to
the
financial
statement
section
28-31,
i
quote,
“section
28-31
was
designed
to
apply
only
to
taxicab
operators
for
use
in
determining
rates.
it
does
not
apply
to
petitioner”.
the
trouble
of
it
is,
the
court
has
held
that
it
applies
to
petitioner.
the
courts
upheld
this
requirement
of
filing
financial
statements,
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals.
so
you
have
a
direct
conflict
here
between
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
these
concessions.
that
is
why
we
say
on
these
two
points,
there
must
be
a
vacation
or
a
reversal
to
line
up
the
judges
so
that
the
district
court
may
enter
a
judgment
in
accordance
with
these
concessions
which
we
submit
are
correct
statement
of
the
law,
that
they
can't
make
us
prove
annually
that
we
are
qualified
and
they
can't
make
us
furnish
these
financial
statements.
now,
one
thing
i
overlooked
doing
in
my
opening
argument
was
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
which
probably
is
unnecessary
that
the
chicago
terminal
railroads
with
the
permission
of
the
court
have
filed
a
brief
as
a
friend
of
the
court
urging
reversal
of
this
cause
and
advising
the
court
that
they
have
precisely
the
same
interest
in
this
case
as
petitioner
had
because
petitioner
is
in
effect
the
alter
ego
of
the
railroads
under
202
(c)
that
mr.
justice
douglas
mentioned
and
in
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
atchison
case.
in
the
atchison
case,
the
railroads
may
perform
the
service
by
themselves
or
by
their
authorized
agent.
thank
you.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
brought
this
action
in
united
states
district
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
a
chicago
ordinance
is
invalid
on
its
face,
a
reason
of
conflict
with
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
city
and
the
other
respondents
who
are
officials
of
the
city
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
the
district
court
dismissed
in
response
to
that
motion
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
some
of
the
issues
in
this
case
were
presented
to
this
court
are
issues
similar
to
those
in
this
case,
were
presented
to
this
court
in
1958
in
chicago
against
atchison,
topeka,
and
santa
fe
railway
company,
357
u.s.77.
in
order
to
understand
the
issues
in
this
instant
case,
it
is
necessary
to
refer
very
briefly
to
some
of
the
facts
in
that
earlier
litigation.
petitioner
is
engaged
under
a
contract
with
the
chicago
railroads
in
transferring
passengers
between
railroad
stations
in
chicago.
it
frequently
happens
that
a
passenger
engaged
on
a
through
journey
through
chicago
must
transfer
from
his
incoming
to
his
outgoing
railroad
station.
the
petitioner
furnishes
that
service
in
specially
designed
buses.
the
petitioner
receives
ultimate
remuneration
from
the
railroads
that
passenger
pays
nothing
to
petitioner.
prior
to
1955,
this
interstation
transfer
service
had
been
performed
for
many
years
by
the
parmelee
transportation
company.
during
the
time
that
parmelee
performed
the
service,
the
service
was
regulated
by
the
city
of
chicago
along
with
taxicab
service
and
other
similar
services
by
what
is
known
as
chapter
28
of
the
municipal
code
of
chicago.
on
june
--
in
june
of
1955,
the
railroads
notified
parmelee
that
as
of
october
1
of
that
year,
they
would
discontinue
using
parmelee
service
and
would
use
petitioner
instead.
about
a
month
later
in
july
of
1955,
the
city
council
of
chicago
passed
an
amendment
to
chapter
28
that
i've
already
mentioned,
that
imposed
two
very
serious
obstacles
or
barricades
to
petitioner
and
the
railroads
in
their
expectation
of
launching
the
new
service.
in
the
first
place
the
amendment
gave
what
amounted
due
a
perpetual
franchise
to
parmelee
to
perform
the
service.
secondly,
it
provided
that
a
newcomer
to
the
field,
such
as
petitioner,
must
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
of
the
city
of
chicago
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
the
new
service.
this
court
in
the
atchison
case
that
i've
mentioned
held
the
amendment
to
chapter
28
invalid
because
in
conflict
with
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i'd
like
to
mention
briefly
here
that
the
evidence
shows
in
that
earlier
case
and
it
is
set
out
both
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
this
court
affirmed,
that
this
action
of
the
chicago
city
council
in
amending
chapter
28
as
i've
said,
was
a
well-planned,
well-conceived
scheme
to
keep
--
to
perpetuate
parmelee
in
the
service
and
to
keep
--
and
to
put
petitioner
out
of
business.
after
the
decision
of
this
case
in
the
atchison
--
after
the
decision
in
the
atchison
case
by
this
court
in
1958,
that
restored
the
status
quo
regulatory
wise
that
had
prevailed
as
to
this
interstation
transfer
service
before
the
1955
amendment.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
leave
regulation
or
have
regulation
of
the
same
type
that
had
covered
parmelee
for
many
years,
all
the
city
of
council
had
to
do
was
simply
do
nothing.
but
shortly
after
--
a
few
months
after
the
mandate
came
down
in
the
former
atchison
case,
the
chicago
city
council
started
on
a
course
of
amendment
of
chapter
28
again
to
the
great
detriment
of
petitioner
and
the
chicago
railroad.
the
council
amended
chapter
--
section
28-6
of
chapter
28
by
requiring
that
annually
a
person
desiring
a
license
to
operate
as
a
public
passenger
vehicle
must
file
an
application
with
the
--
well,
they
already
had
to
file
an
application
but
it
amended
those
application
proceedings
to
provide
that
a
person
filing
an
application
must
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
that
the
applicant
was
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
cabman
or
a
coachman.
now
that
phrase
qualified
to
pursue
the
application
of
a
cabman
or
a
coachman
included
petitioner
within
its
scope
because
petitioner
was
defined
as
a
coachman
in
the
ordinance.
it
also
included
taxicabs
for
the
most
part
but
taxicabs
operators
already
had
to
prove
that
they
--
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
before
conducting
any
operation
since
they
were
an
intrastate
operation,
presumably
that
was
valid,
at
least
it's
never
been
challenged
as
to
the
taxicabs.
in
other
words,
this
amendment
in
1959
to
section
28-6
the
--
almost
the
entire
force
of
it
fell
up
on
the
petitioner.
this
phrase
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
coachman
was
not
in
any
sense,
could
not
--
cannot
in
any
sense,
we
submit,
be
considered
a
regulation
within
the
legitimate
police
power.
it
gave
a
discretion
to
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
to
--
in
his
discretion,
deny
the
application
for
a
certificate
to
perform
this
service.
and
so
we
say
that
--
and
we
cited
the
only
case
we
can
find
on
the
point,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
that
the
phrase
“qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation”
is
a
--
in
substance
a
part
of
the
proof
that
has
to
be
made
in
proving
public
convenience
and
necessity.
so
the
chicago
city
council
got
back
on
the
old
--
in
1959,
got
back
on
the
old
1955
track.
the
council
amended
another
section,
section
28-31
of
chapter
28
required
taxicab
operators
to
furnish
annually
to
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
a
detailed
financial
statement
showing
profit
and
loss
and
all
of
the
detailed
information
that
and
of
a
--
an
intrastate
operator
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
city
council
would
need
to
submit
for
the
purpose
of
rate
regulation.
but
the
council
by
a
very
clear
and
direct
amendment
to
that
provision
required
or
made
that
provision
applicable
to
petitioner.
in
other
words,
it's
something
that
the
petitioner
whose
sole
responsibility
as
to
the
railroads
to
--
it's
furnishing
the
same
kind
of
financial
data
to
the
commissioner
as
taxicab
operators.
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no.
no
sir.
well,
the
--
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i'm
coming
to
something
now
that
i
think
might
answer
your
question.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
in
part
anyway.
and
i'll
cover
that
exclusively
after
i
reached
this
point.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
respondents
now
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
in
this
court,
concede
that
these
two
provisions,
these
two
amendments
that
i've
detailed
cannot
be
applied
to
petitioner.
now
they
did
not
make
that
concession
in
their
brief
opposing
certiorari.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
made
the
same
argument
in
respect
to
these
two
amendments
that
we
now
make
in
our
petition
--
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
and
that
i
have
outlined
briefly
in
argument
here.
so
--
but
for
the
first
time
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
respondents
say
that
these
two
provisions
cannot
be
enforced
against
petitioner.
now
either
that
concession
means
that
the
amendments
are
not
applicable
in
terms
to
petitioner
or
it
means
that
they
cannot
lawfully
be
applied
to
petitioner.
now
we
submit
that
the
two
amendments
are
just
as
clearly
and
precisely
applicable
to
petitioner
in
their
wording
as
an
arrow
hitting
a
bull's
eye.
therefore
we
say
that
this
concession
must
mean
that
respondents
are
admitting
that
these
two
amendments
are
invalid
on
their
face
as
applied
to
petitioner.
now
answering
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
we
have
spelled
this
out
in
detail
in
our
brief
but
i
think
i
can
summarize
it
quite
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
expeditiously.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
correct.
but
i
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
this
was
the
one,
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
section
regarding
financial
statements
by
taxicab
operators
was
made
in
terms
to
apply
to
taxicab
operators.
among
the
definitions
in
chapter
28,
are
these.
a
person
is
defined
as
an
individual,
a
firm,
or
a
corporation,
so
that
before
the
amendment
i'm
referring
to
the
taxicab
amendment
--
the
taxicab
financial
statement
provision
applied
to
taxicab
operators
who
either
were
individuals
or
partnerships,
or
corporations.
it
applied
that
plainly.
now
the
city
council
in
bringing
parmelee
--
bringing
petitioner
within
the
scope
of
that
amendment,
used
the
word
and
made
it
applicable
to
every
corporation
that
is
a
public
passenger
vehicle.
now,
petitioner
is
a
corporation,
petitioner
is
a
public
passenger
vehicle.
so
the
language
could
not
be
any
clearer,
we
submit.
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
was
--
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
first
--
the
case
has
been
to
the
court
of
appeals
twice.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
was
amend
--
it
was
before
the
last
argument
in
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
requirement
to
furnish
financial
data
or
words
to
that
effect
is
within
the
ul
--
the
legitimate
police
power
of
the
city.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
too
for
that
matter
held
the
ordinance
was
valid
on
its
face
and
they
held
that
the
city
had
taken
no
action
of
which
petitioner
could
complain.
we
submit
that
this
concession
amounts
to
an
admission
that
in
these
two
respects,
the
ordinance
is
invalid
on
its
face.
therefore,
we
submit
there
is
a
conflict
between
these
concessions
and
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
therefore,
we
further
submit
that
in
view
of
that,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
vacated
or
reversed
in
order
that
a
judgment
maybe
entered
in
the
district
court
in
accordance
with
the
concession
now
made
in
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
not
entirely,
there
are
two
other
points
that
--
in
which
they
have
not
made
concessions,
or
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
those
other
two
points?
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
i
was
about
to
go
to
those.
there
are
two
other
points.
the
ordinance
was
--
the
ordinance
requires
in
effect
and
there
is
some
dispute
about
this
that
a
petitioner
--
any
operator
of
a
public
vehicle
be
required
to
employ
as
chauffeurs
only
residents
of
the
city
of
chicago.
now
there
is
some
dispute
about
that
as
to
whether
that
is
before
the
court.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
was
in
the
pleadings,
it
was
the
court
--
the
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
with
before
the
court
and
both
of
them
decided
it.
and
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
decided
that
it
is
a
valid
--
within
the
police
power
of
the
city
of
chicago
to
compel
the
petitioner
to
employ
as
chauffeurs
only
residents
of
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
well
at
least
--
yes
sir,
that's
my
understanding.
the
other
provision
is
this
and
it
came
in
by
an
amendment.
the
ordinance
was
amended
after
the
first
atchison
case
to
require
that
every
public
passenger
vehicle
operator
must
maintain
--
if
a
corporation,
must
maintain
its
principal
place
of
business
in
chicago.
now
petitioner
has
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
an
invalid
requirement
under
the
commerce
clause
and
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
far
as
petitioner
is
concerned
to
say
that
a
corporation
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
in
chicago
must
maintain
its
principal
place
of
business
there.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
sir.
this
petitioner's
(inaudible)
it's
only
place
of
business
is
in
chicago.
but
it
is
our
position
on
that,
your
honor,
that
at
some
time
in
the
future,
we
may
want
to
move
our
principal
place
of
business
somewhere
else
without
ceasing
to
do
business
in
chicago.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
i'm
--
i
--
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
we
believe
there
is
in
this
way.
we
have
encountered
at
times
and
we
encountered
it
in
this
case
in
fact,
it's
raised
in
respondent's
brief,
in
respect
to
section
28-6.
in
respect
to
28-6
that
was
amended
to
include
that
qualification
provision,
despite
the
fact
that
that
amendment
was
in
section
28-6,
they
say
that
since
we
didn't
attack
section
28-6
in
earlier
litigation
that
section
26
--
its
28-6
is
valid
on
the
principle
of
res
judicata
or
at
least
the
way
i
understand
that
argument.
now
when
the
time
comes,
if
it
comes,
when
we
want
to
move
our
principal
place
of
business,
we
don't
want
to
be
met
with
an
argument
that
the
question
res
judicata
because
we
didn't
raise
it
in
this
action.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
be
perfectly
frank
if
this
court
should
want
to
say
that
it
isn't
--
it
wasn't
--
isn't
timely
raised,
it
can't
be
raised
now
with
adversary
purpose
just
as
well,
because
we
wouldn't
be
met
with
the
defense
of
res
judicata.
the
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
correct,
if
--
well
--
it
--
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
we'd
want
it,
i
--
yes,
yes,
sir.
we
would
want
you
to
make
--
the
court
to
make
clear
that
we
raised
it
but
we
wouldn't
object
if
the
court
said
that
if
it
wasn't
ripe
for
consideration,
yet.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
because
in
that
way,
that
would
avoid
the
defense
of
res
judicata.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
a
great
deal
of
the
argument
of
the
respondents
is
to
the
effect
that
the
city
has
done
nothing
to
hurt
us.
but
frankly,
we
submit
and
we
believe
that
the
city
is
trying
to
play
the
same
cat
and
mouse
game
with
us
in
this
case
that
they
tried
to
play
in
the
former
atchison
case.
in
the
atchison
case
is
the
opinion
of
the
--
the
opinion
of
this
court
reveals.
the
city
said
the
--
disclaimed
any
intention
to
use
the
phrase
“public
convenience
and
necessity”
as
an
economic
barrier
to
our
operation.
they
said
that
only
compromises
the
reasonable
incidence
of
the
police
power.
and
this
court
disposed
of
that
by
saying
it's
perfectly
clear
whatever
language
you
apply
to
it
that
the
city
is
still
claiming
some
power
to
exclude
or
hamper
petitioner's
operations.
now
there's
a
rather
curious
inconsistency.
well,
i'll
leave
out
the
adjective
and
say
it's
an
inconsistency
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this.
that
in
a
footnote
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
says
that
respondents
now
admit
that
they
have
no
power
to
stop
petitioner's
operations.
but
right
on
the
same
page
and
not
in
the
footnote,
is
this
statement
--
well
anyway,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
finds
that
the
ordinance
confers
the
power
on
the
public
and
vehicle
--
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
to
deny
an
application.
in
other
words,
after
holding
in
the
body
of
its
opinion
that
the
ordinance
gives
the
city
that
power
and
thus
as
we
say
shows
that
the
ordinance
is
invalid
on
its
face,
the
court
in
a
footnote
says
that
the
city
admits
that
it
has
no
power
to
stop
petitioner's
operations.
the
--
we
think
that
in
view
of
that
omission
--
admission
by
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
we
admit
that
it
has
to
have
some
kind
of
a
chauffeur's
license.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
under
some
circumstances,
under
the
police
power.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
but
they
--
we
say
that
they
can
base
the
--
they
can't
say
--
they
can
say
to
us,
“your
chauffeurs
must
have
licenses
as
chauffeurs,
driver
or
a
chauffeur's
license”.
but
we
say
that
they
can't
make
the
criterion
for
that
residence
in
chicago,
that
you
must
be
a
--
the
licensee
must
be
a
resident
in
chicago.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
there
are
circumstances
within
the
police
power
but
we
think
that
the
phrase
used
that
he
must
prove
he's
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
transferring
passengers
between
stations,
gives
the
city
the
right
to
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
exercise
an
economic
power.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh
well,
but
there
are
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
this
is
an
addition
to
all
of
those
others.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
and
it
is
not
a
sum
--
it
is
not
a
summarization
of
them.
if
you
examine
the
structure
of
the
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
right.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
right.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
because
the
city
--
because
--
two
answers
to
that,
because
of
our
past
experience
with
the
city
of
deliberately
trying
to
put
us
out
of
business
and
we
think
this
is
another
attempt
along
the
same
line.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
we've
had
licenses
in
the
first
year
which
we
obtained
under
the
rest.
and
since
then,
we've
been
depositing
the
license
fee
without
obtaining
licenses
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
the
district
court.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
they
have
not.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
but
someday,
we
think
they
will
under
critical
times.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
now
the
point
is
we
don't
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
those
circumstances
are
spelled
out
in
the
ordinance
and
we
don't
attack
them.
but
to
superimpose
this
discretionary
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation.
the
only
two
cases
we
can
find
on
that
that
used
that
language
say
unreserved
a
bit
that
that
gives
a
discretion
beyond
ordinary
police
power
qualifications.
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
can
just
a
few
minutes
i
have
left
for
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
i
want
to
refer
very
briefly
to
the
concession
that
i
mentioned
in
my
argument
and
i
want
to
read
them
or
the
part
of
them.
on
page
16
of
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits,
“the
city
specifically
denied
that
transfer
must
prove
annually
that
it
is
qualified”.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
city
specifically
denied
that
transfer
must
prove
annually
that
it
is
qualified.
well,
now
what
we
say,
as
i
said
before
the
--
in
as
much
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
valid,
that
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
to
affirm
a
legal
situation
that
the
city
now
concedes
--
cannot
be
applied
to
petitioner.
then
in
respect
to
the
financial
statement
section
28-31,
i
quote,
“section
28-31
was
designed
to
apply
only
to
taxicab
operators
for
use
in
determining
rates.
it
does
not
apply
to
petitioner”.
the
trouble
of
it
is,
the
court
has
held
that
it
applies
to
petitioner.
the
courts
upheld
this
requirement
of
filing
financial
statements,
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals.
so
you
have
a
direct
conflict
here
between
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
these
concessions.
that
is
why
we
say
on
these
two
points,
there
must
be
a
vacation
or
a
reversal
to
line
up
the
judges
so
that
the
district
court
may
enter
a
judgment
in
accordance
with
these
concessions
which
we
submit
are
correct
statement
of
the
law,
that
they
can't
make
us
prove
annually
that
we
are
qualified
and
they
can't
make
us
furnish
these
financial
statements.
now,
one
thing
i
overlooked
doing
in
my
opening
argument
was
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
which
probably
is
unnecessary
that
the
chicago
terminal
railroads
with
the
permission
of
the
court
have
filed
a
brief
as
a
friend
of
the
court
urging
reversal
of
this
cause
and
advising
the
court
that
they
have
precisely
the
same
interest
in
this
case
as
petitioner
had
because
petitioner
is
in
effect
the
alter
ego
of
the
railroads
under
202
(c)
that
mr.
justice
douglas
mentioned
and
in
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
atchison
case.
in
the
atchison
case,
the
railroads
may
perform
the
service
by
themselves
or
by
their
authorized
agent.
thank
you.
