justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
to
us
that
if
respondents
have
made
a
concession
on
these
two
points
that
that
disposes
of
your
grievance?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
so,
and
--
but
are
you
still
pressing
those?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
simon
i
am
having
one
difficulty
in
finding
out
just
what
the
issues
are.
justice
abe
fortas
i'd
like
to
ask
you
specifically
in
the
28-6.
does
the
city
now
say
that
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
here,
the
commissioner
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
make
the
planning
that
the
applicant
is
qualified
or
is
not
qualified
to
engage
in
this
business.
what
is
your
position?
as
i
understand
it,
28
--
under
28-6
petitioner
takes
position
that
they
did
file
an
application
under
duress
and
it
was
granted.
but
that
requiring
them
to
seek
a
determination
from
the
commissioner
that
they
are
not
qualified
to
carry
on
this
business
is
in
conflict
with
the
commerce
clause
with
this
court's
decision
in
atchison.
then
i
understood
counsel
--
mr.
mathews
to
suggest
that
perhaps
you
had
conceded,
he
said
he
has
conceded
that
28-6
phrase
that
i
read
from
28-6
it
is
a
dead
letter.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
is
the
city's
position?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
i'm
asking
you
now.
i
thought
--
that's
the
issue
that
they're
trying
to
present
to
us
anyway
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
under
what
--
maybe
it
is
or
is
not
properly
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
simon,
i
don't
want
to
press
you
unduly.
but
it
is
stated
to
us
that
this
phrase
that
i
read
to
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
was
incorporated
in
these
--
in
this
ordinance
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
after
our
decision
in
atchison.
and
the
petitioner
here
says
that
it
should
not
be
required
to
seek
a
determination
from
the
commissioner
in
the
city
of
chicago
as
to
whether
it
is
or
it
is
not
qualified.
and
i
think
--
i'm
sure
i'd
be
very
grateful
to
you
if
you
just
tell
me
plainly
whether
the
city
fixed
the
position
that
this
phrase
that
i
read
is
or
is
not
applicable
here.
and
whether
the
petitioner
does
or
does
not
have
to
submit
an
application,
whether
the
commissioner
does
or
does
not
have
a
jurisdiction
under
the
city's
view
to
make
the
determination
as
to
qualification
of
the
petitioner.
justice
abe
fortas
precisely
what
part
of
28-6
was
added
after
our
decision
in
atchison?
was
it
just
this
phrase
about
the
commissioner
finding
that
the
applicant
is
qualified?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
only
thing
that
was
added
to
28-6?
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
doesn't
seem
squarely
pure
interpretation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
requirements
of
filing
a
balance
sheet
in
the
property
loss
statement,
does
the
city
require
that
of
taxicab
companies?
justice
abe
fortas
which
it
filed
balance
sheet
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
property
loss
statement.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
looking
at
the
questions
in
petitioners'
brief
on
page
3
and
the
specific
questions
that
they
present
to
us
on
number
two.
justice
abe
fortas
whether
chicago
may
by
the
ordinance
compel
the
petitioner
to
file
a
statement
of
expenses
and
earnings
in
its
balance
sheet.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
(b),
to
afford
the
city
officials
access
to
its
business
and
financial
books
and
records?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
your
answer
--
justice
abe
fortas
your
answer
is
the
same.
the
city
agrees
that
it
does
not
apply?
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
the
next
page,
employ
only
residents,
that
is
an
issue
before
us,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
employ
only
residents
of
chicago
as
drivers.
and
the
next
one
(d),
to
maintain
the
principal
place
of
business
in
(inaudible)
you
take
the
position
that
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
a
question
that's
not
properly
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
decision.
