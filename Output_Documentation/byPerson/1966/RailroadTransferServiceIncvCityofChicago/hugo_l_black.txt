justice

black
well
that
would
be
true,
would
it
not,
if
what
you
are
seeking
to
accomplish
by
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
just
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
decide
that
these
people
cannot
operate
this
terminal
facility.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
you
could
regulate
with
consequences
that
would
have
the
same
effect
as
licensing
them
to
do
this
interstate
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
from
you,
i
maybe
wrong,
i
understood
from
you
to
say
that
he
is
required
to
do
these
certain
things.
if
he
doesn't
do
it,
he
can't
get
a
license.
now
what's
the
consequence
if
he
is
not
getting
a
license
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
city?
justice
hugo

would
you
require
the
railroad
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
require
this
with
the
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
operate
through
the
city,
do
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
to
make
the
statement
here
about
the
city
of
chicago
that
there's
nothing
in
this
ordinance
which
it
thinks
or
believe
to
give
it
the
right
to
attach
consequences
which
would
prevent
this
company
from
operating
on
the
streets
of
chicago?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
consider
this
a
license
which
you
require
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
charge
to
an
out-of-state
vehicle
for
actually
using
the
roads,
the
actual
value
of
the
use
of
the
roads?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
you
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
license
rather
than
a
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
in
effect
as
i
understand
you,
there's
a
license
to
be
charged,
the
operation
of
these
interstate
vehicles
and
for
a
violation
of
the
law
requirement
of
license,
parties
can
either
be
fined
or
they
can
be
sued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
other
interstate
vehicles
that
are
required
to
be
licensed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
you
could
license
a
railroad
train,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
context
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
context
here,
what's
the
difference
between
licenses
--
this
interstate
vehicle
as
licensing
a
train
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
parts
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
the
railroad
makes
a
part
of
that
living
from
the
use
of
the
streets,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
buses,
interstate
buses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
do
it
the
same
as
you
could
do
this
one,
couldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
state
hasn't,
but
why
couldn't
it
do
that
to
the
interstate
buses
if
it
can
do
it
to
this
interstate
bus?
justice
hugo
l.
black
operate
its
interstate
business
within
the
city
of
chicago?
justice
hugo
l.
black
denies
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
doing
in
the
way
of
regulating
them
as
for
their
financial
ability
i
assume
you
would
read
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
do
it
if
congress
authorizes
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
the

(voice

that
the

have
a
power
and
authority
to
impose
every
regulation
you've
imposed
on

why
do
you
want
to
do
it
under
the
name
of
a
license
claim,
put
them
in

if
they
do
not

do
you
mean
you
have
--
justice

black
--
5000
engaged
in
interstate

justice
hugo
l.
black
well
this
of

has
to
be
put
