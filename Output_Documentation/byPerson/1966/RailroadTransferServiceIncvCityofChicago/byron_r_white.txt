what
if
your
client
insisted
on
his
drivers
not
having
licenses,
driver's
licenses
or
chauffeurs'
licenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
that
there
are
some
grounds
on
which
local
authorities
could
suspend
your
operations
or
revoke
your
certificate
or
deny
an
app
--
a
new
application.
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
the
local
authorities
would
have
power,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
--
in
some
circumstances
and
they
would
have
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
i
was
just
--
i
don't
see
that
why
the
court
of
appeals
necessarily
inconsistent.
it
simply
said
that
the
ordinance
does
give
the
power
to
the
local
authorities
to
suspend
or
revoke
permits
or
to
deny
an
application.
that
doesn't
mean
it's
invalid
on
the
state
because
there
are
some
circumstances
and
if
that
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
one
example
of
proving
your
qualifications
to
prove
that
you've
got
drivers
who
are
licensed
for
example
to
drive
vehicles.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
even
know
what
--
but,
you
don't
know
and
i
guess
this
is
your
point,
what
qualifications
the
city
is
going
to
insist
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
no
--
except
that
you
have
them
because
you're
licensed.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
wrong
--
what's
the
--
then
why,
why
shouldn't
the
court
wait
and
see
the
circumstances
in
which
--
or
the
qualifications
on
which
the
city
is
going
to
insist
and
the
circumstances
in
which
you
might
be
denied
the
right
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they're
licensed,
i
mean,
if
you
--
license
is
every
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
haven't
refused
the
license
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that
--
why
isn't
that
a
good
time
then
to
test
out
the
validity
of
this
ordinance
since
there
are
some
circumstances
on
which
you
admit
they
could
deny
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
could
you
help
me
out
--
well,
there's
no
suggestion
that
there
is
--
that
there's
anything
wrong
when
they're
litigating
the
validity
of
this
ordinance,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
--
are
you
(inaudible)
and
you
are
sustaining
or
saying
that
neither
--
that
the
district
court
didn't
have
any
jurisdiction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
entertain
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i'm
not
sure
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
what
helps
to
decide
the
case,
to
find
out
who
was
trying
to
subvert
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
be
--
real
--
isn't
it
really
the
issue
is
the
validity
of
this
ordinance
under
the
constitution
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
of
appeals
decide
that
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says,
but
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
says
the
district
court
found
jurisdiction
to
entertain
transfer's
second
amended
complaint.
we
agree
--
do
they
say
we
--
you
do
have
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
they
said
there
was
no
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
there
though,
there's
no
criminal
penalty
to
any
kinds
of
--
or
even
(inaudible)
penalty
to
refuse
for
operating
without
a
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
really
the
conflict,
the
city
wanted
to
(inaudible)
having
these
there
are
ordinances
to
enforce
the
licenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
criminally?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
whether
or
not
you
have
a
terminal
railroad
in
the
city
of
chicago
that
operates
fully
interstate?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
commission
does
that
you
have
the
--
does
the
--
commission
doesn't
hold
regulation
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
don't
say
that
now
do
you,
and
you'd
still
litigate
(inaudible)
that
a
license
is
required
for
transfer
to
operate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
whatever
the
qualifications
are
that
you
will
insist
on
to
get
a
license,
you
are
insisting
that
the
transfer
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
must
have
the
qualification
to
present
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
must
be
licensed
and
here
the
qualifications
for
licenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
qualifications,
are
those
in
28-6
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
--
there
are
no
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
--
and
if
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
they
use
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
like
you
do
--
you
concede
or
in
a
sense
concede
that
you
could
not
apply
criminal
penalties
to
transfer
for
operating
without
a
license
because
that's
very
close
to
saying
you
can
stop
the
operation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
financial
ability?
it's
to
conduct
the

of
the

now
that's
the

the

you
just
told
me
a

they
weren't
even
required
to
do
that.
all
they
have

for

you
said
all
