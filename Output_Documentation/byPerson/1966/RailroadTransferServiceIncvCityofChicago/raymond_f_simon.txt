mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
very
outset,
the
city
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
it
fully
understands
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
atchison.
the
city
of
chicago
does
not
urge
upon
this
court
any
change
or
modification
whatsoever
in
the
opinion
enunciated
in
atchison
versus
chicago,
357
u.s.
77.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
at
pages
88
and
89,
the
city
retains
considerable
authority
to
regulate
how
transfer
vehicles
shall
be
operated.
it
could
hardly
be
denied
for
example,
that
such
vehicles
must
obey
traffic
signals,
speed
limits,
and
other
general
safety
regulations.
similarly,
the
city
may
require
registration
of
these
vehicles
and
exact
reasonable
fees
for
their
use
of
the
city
streets.
all
we
hold
here
and
all
we
construe
the
court
of
appeals
as
holding
is
that
the
city
has
no
power
to
decide
whether
transfer
can
operate
a
motor
vehicle
service
between
terminals
for
the
railroads
because
this
service
is
an
integral
part
of
interstate
railroad
transportation
authorized
and
subject
to
regulation
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
is
not
the
city
which
is
attempting
to
avoid
this
court's
opinion
in
atchison,
but
rather
it
is
railroad
transfer
which
has
been
dissatisfied
with
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
in
atchison
which
struck
down
only
section
28-31.1
relating
to
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
sustained
the
entire
remainder
of
the
chapter,
it's
transfer
which
has
begun
this
litigation
anew
in
its
attempt
to
accomplish
what
it
failed
to
accomplish
when
the
first
litigation
took
place.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
point,
mr.
justice
white
that
i'm
attempting
to
make
is
that
throughout
its
briefs,
transfer
argues
that
the
city
of
chicago
is
endeavoring
to
subvert
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
atchison.
in
the
brief,
transfer
argues
that
it
was
a
hostile
city
council,
bent
and
subverting
this
court's
opinion
which
in
a
diehard
effort
to
impair
constitutional
rights
amended
chapter
28
and
inserted
the
provision
relating
to
as
--
transfer
argues
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
convenience
and
necessity
again.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
forget
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice
white
and
perhaps
what
would
the
city
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
perhaps
the
city
was
just
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
court
of
appeals
really
held
that
there
was
no
controversy.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
but
the
question
which
you
presented
to
mr.
mathews
was
really
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
they
said
there
is
no
controversy.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
city
of
chicago
has
issued
all
of
the
licenses
which
transfer
his
applied
for.
what
transfer
was
required
to
present
was
simply
a
one
page
application,
a
one
page
financial
statement,
a
list
of
its
equipment,
its
corporate
charters,
certificate
to
do
business
in
illinois,
its
insurance
policy,
and
its
fees,
and
nothing
more.
and
the
city
of
chicago
issued
all
of
the
licenses
which
transfer
applied
for
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
find
no
controversy.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
your
honor
was
that
relates
to
as
in
the
initial
complaint,
the
city
asserted
that
the
amount
in
controversy
was
not
sufficient
to
give
jurisdiction
that
the
amount
of
fees
that
had
accumulated
was
not
equal
to
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and
then
transfer
amended
and
said
that
they
seek
jurisdiction
based
upon
the
interstate
commerce
clause
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
the
commerce
act.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
courts
said
they
do
have
jurisdiction.
but
the
sequence
of
events
which
led
from
the
district
court
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
this
court
illuminate
with
harsh
clarity
the
insincerity
of
the
arguments
which
transfer
advances
in
the
present
litigation
in
the
district
court.
both
the
complaint
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
indicated
that
transfer
was
concerned
about
the
payment
of
fees.
the
district
court
said
and
i
quote
from
the
record
at
page
133,
“if
i
am
to
find
the
principal
source
of
plaintiff's
claim
of
grievance,
it
is
that
plaintiff
has
required
to
pay
an
annual
license
or
tax
to
the
city
of
chicago
for
the
privilege
of
operating
its
terminal
vehicles
whereas
public
utilities
and
other
companies
carrying
out
a
similar
business
are
not
subject
to
the
same
requirement”.
the
district
court
found
the
classification
was
reasonable
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
then
in
the
court
of
appeals,
transfer
tried
a
new
attack.
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
complained
that
our
ordinance
was
invalid
because
it
did
not
provide
for
some
administrative
hearing
before
there
might
be
consideration
given
to
revocation
of
licenses.
and
it
argued
that
certain
safety
regulations
were
invalid
because
they
required
that
a
vehicle
should
be
of
a
uniform
color
for
example.
and
they
argued
again
that
the
requirement
--
that
the
principal
place
of
business
of
coachmen
be
in
the
city
and
that
their
chauffeurs
be
residents
of
the
city.
all
these
arguments
were
advanced
as
to
the
invalidity
of
the
municipal
code
of
chicago.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
city's
position
is
that
the
record
does
not
show
whether
section
28-6
was
applied
to
transfer.
the
reason
i'm
sure
that
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
or
not
it
was
applied
was
that
this
argument
was
not
the
issue
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
down
the
district
court.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
in
regard
to
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice,
in
regard
to
your
specific
question,
the
city
in
its
brief
was
attempting
to
contradict
transfer,
not
concede
that
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
coachman
was
not
applicable.
the
city
was
attempting
to
deny
that
the
interpretation
of
that
phrase
is
correct.
the
city
takes
the
position
that
section
28-6
must
be
read
as
a
unity.
and
the
first
sentence
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
mr.
justice,
i
--
really
and
truly,
i'm
not
trying
not
to
evade
your
question.
but
the
record
does
not
show
whether
or
not
it
was
applied.
if
it
were
to
be
applied,
it
must
be
applied
in
accordance
with
the
entire
section
so
that
if
this
section
28-6
is
read
in
its
entirely,
the
word
qualified
means
that
the
commissioner
finds
that
the
applicant
is
a
law
abiding
citizen
with
financial
ability
to
carry
on
safe
and
comfortable
service,
maintain
and
replaces
equipment
and
pay
his
judgments.
this
is
the
list
of
qualifications.
and
in
this
context,
yes,
the
provision
applies.
it
can
only
be
read
together
what
counsel
for
transfer
is
attempting
to
present
to
the
court
as
an
interpretation
which
separates
the
first
sentence
of
section
28-6
from
the
second
sentence.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
the
first
sentence
would
be
meaningless
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
mr.
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
what
the
section
says
is
that
the
public
vehicle
commissioner
shall
determine
if
the
documents
that
must
be
filed
are
properly
executed
and
determine
if
the
applicant
is
qualified.
and
the
lists
of
qualifications
are
those
that
are
set
out
in
the
first
sentence.
he
must
determine
whether
his
character
and
reputation
is
that
of
a
law
abiding
citizen.
he
must
determine
that
he
has
the
financial
ability
to
render
safe
and
comfortable
service.
he
must
determine
that
he
is
able
to
maintain
and
replace
the
equipment
for
such
service
and
pay
judgments
that
arise
in
the
conduct
of
his
business.
these
are
the
lists
of
qualifications.
if
he
meets
these
qualifications,
he
does
not
get
a
contract
to
work
for
the
railroads.
he
gets
his
licenses.
and
this
is
one
of
the
essential
fallacies
of
transfer's
argument
is
that
there
is
a
basic
distinction
between
the
city's
attempt
to
regulate
whether
a
particular
terminal
vehicle
service
can
operate
which
is
clearly
unconstitutional
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
if
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
the
word
that
was
added
was
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
cabman
or
coachman
whereas
in
the
past,
it
read,
if
he's
qualified
as
a
cabman,
i
believe.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
now
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
the
reason
for
the
insertion
is
a
very
simple
explanation
and
it's
so
unsophisticated
that
it's
hard
to
present
the
city
of
chicago
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
city
of
chicago
has
these
categories
of
licensees,
cabman
which
includes
taxicab
operators
and
every
vehicle
operators
and
sightseeing
buses
and
terminal
vehicles.
now
what
the
city
did
at
the
time
it
was
amending
this
law
was
to
separate
cabman
from
all
others
because
we
have
well
over
5000
taxicabs
in
chicago
and
that's
the
bulk
of
our
regulation.
then
we
took
the
word
coachman
and
defined
it
to
include
busman,
delivery
vehicles,
and
terminal
vehicles.
we
no
longer
have
a
definition
for
the
word
busman.
that
was
completely
dropped
out
of
the
ordinance.
it's
not
covered
by
coachman.
the
word
coachman
was
inserted
here
simply
to
make
it
clear
that
this
is
the
universal
inclusive
of
public
passenger
vehicles.
it
includes
cabman.
it
includes
coachman.
it's
another
way
of
saying
it
includes
taxicabs,
delivery
vehicles,
sightseeing
buses,
and
terminal
vehicles.
and
that
is
all
that
this
section
was
amended
to
change.
it's
a
very
bland
amendment.
but
what
counsel
has
attempted
to
do
is
to
make
equivalent
to
public
convenience
and
necessity,
the
use
of
the
simple
words
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
coachman.
now
the
city
contends
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
perhaps
it
would
clarify
it
somewhat,
mr.
justice
black
to
say
that
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
occupation
which
we
may
focus
on.
one
is
the
aspect
of
operating
the
vehicles
on
the
streets
of
the
city
of
chicago.
that's
pursuing
the
occupation
of
a
coachman.
another
aspect
is
contracting
with
the
railroads
to
do
their
business
for
them.
now
the
city
maintains
that
this
court
said,
“we
could
not
--
we
could
regulate
how
they
maintain
their
vehicles”.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
absolutely
not.
that's
precisely
what
this
court
told
us
we
could
not
do.
and
we
contend
we're
not
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
if
he
doesn't
obtain
a
license,
we'll
file
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
if
he
does
not
obtain
a
license,
we'll
file
a
lawsuit
to
compel
him,
to
take
out
a
license
and
pay
us
the
fees
because
we
have
a
right
to
know
that
their
vehicles
are
safe.
this
court
has
held
that
that
right
is
permitted
to
cities
and
unless
they
come
in
and
submit
their
vehicles
for
testing
and
take
out
a
license
after
they
show
their
qualifications
to
the
city,
we
won't
know
whether
the
vehicles
are
safe
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
and
this
is
an
obligation
which
we
owe
to
the
people
of
chicago.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
railroads
don't
operate
on
the
streets
of
the
city.
mr.
justice,
i'm
sure
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
do
operate
through
our
city.
there's
no
question
that
they
do
but
you
see
railroad
terminal
is
a
unique
kind
of
interstate
operator.
its
sole
business
is
limited
to
one
or
two
square
miles
within
the
center
of
the
city
of
chicago.
it
never
leaves
our
city.
it
operates
its
business
completely
upon
the
city
streets.
and
this
court
has
always
held
that
there's
a
balancing
between
the
inconvenience
to
the
interstate
carrier
and
the
benefit
to
occur
to
the
public.
and
we
maintain
when
their
whole
business
is
derived
from
transporting
passengers
on
the
city
streets.
we
have
a
right
to
impose
reasonable
safety
regulations
and
collect
fees
for
that.
and
we
believe
that's
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
atchison.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice,
that's
true.
we
do
not
believe
that
we
can
prevent
transfer
from
operating.
what
we
do
believe
we
have
a
right
to
do,
if
they
refused
to
take
out
licenses,
if
they
just
take
the
position
that
they're
an
interstate
carrier,
we'll
have
absolutely
no
regulation
from
chicago,
we'll
file
a
lawsuit
and
we'll
ask
the
court
to
order
them
to
meet
the
qualifications
of
our
ordinance,
to
submit
their
vehicles
for
testing
and
to
show
that
they
are
law
abiding
citizens
with
financial
ability
to
maintain
safe
and
comfortable
service
and
to
maintain
and
replace
their
equipment.
that's
the
city's
position,
mr.
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
we
contend
that
this
is
not
an
issue
in
this
litigation
because
the
allegation
and
the
complaint
of
transfer
states
that
they're
a
delaware
corporation
with
their
principal
place
of
business
in
the
city
of
chicago.
and
we
maintain
that
it
is
because
their
business
involves
transporting
passengers
from
one
railway
station
in
chicago
to
another
railway
station
in
chicago
that
accounts
for
their
residents
and
their
principal
place
of
business
being
in
the
city
and
that
in
a
requirement
of
our
ordinance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
is
in
the
sense
that
it
was
litigated
in
the
bulks
(ph)
case
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
in
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
it
in
this
litigation
in
which
they
articulate
the
expression
of
accessible
responsibility.
and
by
that
expression
they
mean
that
if
the
residents
reside
within
the
city,
they're
within
the
reach
of
those
investigative
and
police
officials
who
have
as
their
business
supervising
the
conduct
of
taxicab
and
railway
transfer
vehicles
in
the
city.
their
residents
will
be
within
the
reach
of
those
officials
who
have
business
with
them.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
we
consider
this
charge
to
be
equal
to
the
cost
to
the
city
to
offset
the
administration
of
the
licensing
provision.
in
other
words,
the
amount
of
money
which
is
paid
to
the
city
is
equal
to
what
it
costs
the
city
to
have
clerks
to
process
the
paper
and
to
have
men
to
test
their
vehicles.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
it
was
cast
in
that
regard
historically,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
material
if
it
were
on
either
manner.
it
was
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
license
fee?
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
charge?
i
believe
its
$40
for
a
seven-passenger
vehicle.
that's
$40
for
a
seven-passenger
vehicle.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
your
honor
but
the
city
--
the
section
relates
to
all
of
the
public
vehicles
in
the
city
of
chicago,
cabman
and
coachman
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
it
could
file
a
lawsuit
and
attempt
to
charge
a
penalty,
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
that's
correct.
criminal
in
the
sense
of
fine,
there's
no
imprisonment
for
operating
without
a
license.
it's
a
fine,
i
believe,
of
a
maximum
of
$200.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice,
no.
that
section
that
you're
alluding
to
i
believe
is
section
28-30.1,
am
i
correct?
is
that
what
you're
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
but
what
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
we
take
the
position
that
that
section
does
not
relate
to
transfer.
that
section
is
28-30.1.
it
has
not
been
applied
to
transfer.
there's
no
showing
in
the
record
that
it
applies
to
transfer.
and
it's
inserted
in
our
ordinance
in
the
section
that
relates
to
the
fixing
of
fees
for
taxicabs.
it's
the
section
that
relates
to
rates.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
the
word
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
these
are
the
provisions
of
the
section
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
which
we
contend
does
not
apply.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
when
we
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
we
believe
that
there's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice,
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
but
its
important
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice,
there
are
no
other
vehicles
in
the
entire
city
of
chicago
like
railroad
transfer's
vehicles.
railroad
transfer
is
a
unique
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
or
at
least
unusual.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
no
mr.
justice,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
the
city
would
contend
that
but
the
railroad
trains
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
do
not
operate
on
the
city
streets.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
this
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
this
interstate
vehicle
makes
its
sole
living
from
the
use
of
the
streets
of
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice,
they
own
their
own
railroad
right
away.
they
do
no
travel
upon
the
city
streets
and
make
their
entire
business
from
transporting
passengers
and
baggage
over
the
city
streets.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
buses
are
not
within
the
range
of
the
city's
ordinance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
because
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
because
our
state
commission
has
preempted
the
regulation
of
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
because
the
city's
authority
to
regulate
does
not
extend
beyond
its
corporate
limits.
and
this
interstate
carrier
operates
solely
within
the
municipality
of
the
city
of
chicago.
its
entire
business
is
conducted
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
we
do
not
have,
unless
you
would
look
upon
our
mass
transportation
system
as
that
kind
of
a
railroad
and
even
that
extends
into
the
entire
county
area.
we
do
not
have
an
interstate
railroad.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
our
state
commission?
i
don't
know
the
answer,
mr.
justice.
the
city
of
chicago
does
not.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice,
the
record
shows
that
the
city
of
chicago
issued
all
of
the
licenses
which
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
transfer
applied
for
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
are
you
addressing
the
question
to
section
28-6?
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
record
is
absolutely
silent
on
whether
that
section
has
been
applied.
and
the
reason
of
silent
is
that
it
was
not
the
issue
in
the
trial
court
wherever
the
--
where
evidence
was
taken.
our
position
is
that
if
it
does
apply,
it
must
be
applied
in
the
sense
of
the
qualifications
being
those
set
out
in
the
first
sentence
relating
to
safety
requirement.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
know
--
i
know
now
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
know
now
mr.
justice
what
you're
referring
to.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
was
a
letter
written
by
the
public
vehicle
license
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
commissioner
when
transfer
did
not
apply
for
licenses.
and
it
was
a
letter
which
was
not
a
work
of
art
written
by
attorneys.
it
was
a
letter
which
in
essence
said,
pay
up
or
stop
doing
business
in
the
city
of
chicago.
the
city
of
chicago
does
take
the
position
that
we
will
not
and
that
we
cannot
stop
transfer
from
operating
because
as
mr.
justice
black
points
out
they
are
an
interstate
carrier.
and
you
told
us
in
the
atchison
decision
that
we
could
not
decide
whether
they
can
operate.
all
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
decide
how
they
operate
their
vehicles.
in
our
ordinance
we
contend
relates
to
safety
requirements.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
it
is.
it
is
in
the
record
and
the
letter
does
say,
“apply
for
your
licenses
and
pay
the
fees
or
cease-and-desist
doing
business.
we
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
say
a
license
is
required
but
we
deny
that
the
way
in
which
we'll
enforce
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
they
--
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
the
first
sentence.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
those
are
the
qualifications.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
no,
no.
the
payment
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
payment
of
fees
and
so
on
but
no
other
qualifications,
that's
correct.
the
qualifications
are
set
out
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
in
those
three
phrases.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
city
of
chicago
would
not
stop
them.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
order
them
to
comply
with
our
ordinance.
i
think
mr.
justice
that
the
gist
of
our
ordinance
is
that
we
want
them
to
submit
their
vehicles
so
we
can
have
a
safety
test.
we
want
them
to
carry
insurance
so
that
the
public
will
be
protected.
we
want
them
to
be
law
abiding
citizens
so
that
the
management
will
be
responsible.
that's
in
essence
what
that
section
relates
to.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
(inaudible)
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
think
the
financial
ability
would
be
satisfied
by
the
showing
that
they
carry
insurance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct
because
it
wasn't
litigated.
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no
because
we
don't
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
debate
the
question
that
this
is
a
link
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
we
do
not
deny
that
it
is.
no,
we
don't.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
they
are
--
i
think
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they're
really
unique
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they're
in
a
unique
situation,
mr.
justice
douglas
because
they're
not
regulated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
same
way
that
other
interstate
transportation
companies
are.
they
don't
test
their
vehicles.
they
don't
subject
them
to
the
requirements.
but
they
are
deemed
a
link
in
interstate
commerce
and
they
are
clothed
with
that
protection
of
interstate
business.
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice,
we
do
not
make
that
concession.
it's
unfortunate
that
the
use
of
the
italics
confuses
the
intention
of
the
city.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
on
page
16
in
the
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
our
brief.
it
says,
“the
city”,
and
it's
in
italics,
“the
city
specifically
denies
that
transfer
must
“prove
annually
that
it
is
qualified”.
we
mean
--
we
deny
their
interpretation
that
they
prove
that
they're
qualified
to
contract
with
the
railroads
to
perform
their
interstation
business.
we
do
maintain
they
must
annually
prove
they're
qualified
by
showing
that
they're
law
abiding,
that
they
have
sufficient
financial
ability
to
carry
on
safe
and
comfortable
service.
in
other
words,
the
qualifications
that
are
in
the
first
sentence
of
section
28-6
do
apply
the
assertion
that
we
are
interested
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
interstate
business
is
qualified
to
work
for
the
railroads,
we
categorically
denied.
what
we're
saying
in
the
section
that
as
transfer
interprets
that
language,
we
denied
that
they
ever
annually
or
ever
must
prove
they're
qualified.
as
the
language
is
clearly
set
out
in
section
28-6
which
relates
to
financial
ability
not
section
30.1
which
mr.
mathews
alludes
to,
as
the
section
is
set
out
in
28-6,
we
do
assert
that
it's
applicable
to
transfer
and
we
use
the
italics
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
it
was
their
interpretation.
reading
the
section
completely
disassociated
with
the
first
sentence
that
we
denied.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
what
other
concession?
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
no,
that
is
not
another
concession
because
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
section
28-6
uses
the
word
financial
responsibility.
that
section
is
applicable
to
transfer.
section
30.1
which
requires
the
furnishing
of
financial
data
relates
to
cab
companies
and
is
intended
to
apply
to
fixing
of
rates
and
does
not
apply
to
transfer.
so
we're
not
making
a
concession
that
28-6
does
not
apply
when
we
say
that
they
do
not
have
to
furnish
the
detailed
financial
records
that
are
covered
by
30.1.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
what
they
did
in
the
present
instance
was
to
furnish
a
one
page
financial
statement
showing
their
balance,
the
value
of
their
equipment,
and
the
outstanding
liabilities.
and
nothing
more
was
required
of
them.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
that's
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
my
opinion
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
my
opinion
their
licenses
would
be
issued
if
they
had
insurance.
the
requirement
of
showing
financial
ability
was
satisfied
by
showing
of
a
simple
six-line
financial
statement.
i
don't
think
the
city
would
insist
upon
any
specific
dollar
balance.
i
think
we
ask
for
the
statement
simply
to
see
what
it
says,
to
see
if
they
have
hundreds
of
tort
judgments
outstanding
against
them
for
running
over
passengers
and
pedestrians
in
the
city.
then
we
called
to
the
attention
of
the
railroads
the
kind
of
contracting
party
they're
operating
with.
then
we
might
file
a
lawsuit
and
attempt
to
enjoin
them
from
operating.
that's
what
we
mean
by
the
section.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
and
if
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
if
they
were
preempt
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
but
mr.
justice
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
believe
they
would,
yes.
i
believe
they
would
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
city
cannot
exercise
regulatory
powers
if
they
relate
to
safety
in
the
same
areas
as
the
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
the
section
as
i
point
out
mr.
justice
relates
to
the
entire
ambit
of
public
passenger
vehicle
operators.
cabman
and
coachman
include
every
public
passenger
vehicle.
transfer
has
20
vehicles
and
as
included
in
that
section.
it
was
not
designed
primarily
for
them.
it
applies
to
them,
and
we
think
the
application
is
reasonable
and
should
be
sustained
but
the
use
of
the
license
is
because
we
have
over
5000
taxicabs,
several
hundred
delivery
vehicles,
a
dozen
or
more
sightseeing
vehicles
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
all
of
which
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
no.
no,
your
honor.
the
section
relates
to
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
this
section
that
we're
debating
mr.
justice
relates
only
to
safety
requirements.
and
this
court
has
said,
we
could
impose
safety
requirements
upon
transfer.
and
this
court
told
us
in
the
same
sentence
that
transfer
was
an
interstate
carrier.
in
the
opening
section
which
i
quoted
in
this
argument
where
it
said,
“all
we
hold
is
that
the
city
cannot
determine
whether
or
not
transfer
operates
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
this
court
said,
“all
we
hold
in
atchison
and
all
we
construed
the
court
of
appeals
is
holding
is
that
the
city
cannot
determine
whether
transfer
may
operate
for
the
city
retains
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
considerable
authority
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
to
regulate
how
they
operate”.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice,
the
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
take
the
position
that
we
cannot
stop
him
from
operating.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
would
have
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we've
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
filed
a
lawsuit
if
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
if
the
court
ordered
that
he
was
willfully
refusing
to
submit
his
vehicles
for
a
safety
test,
and
if
he
refused
to
do
that,
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
believe
the
court
could
order
it.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
we
could
fine
him
up
to
$200
under
the
law.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
if
he
refuse
to
pay
that
fine
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
oh
surely,
your
honor,
we
have
no
authority
in
the
city
of
chicago
to
punish
by
imprisonment.
the
only
authority
we
have
for
a
violation
of
city
ordinances
is
to
punish
by
fine.
we
have
no
authority
to
imprison.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
then
they
can
be
imprisoned
up
to
six
months
for
nonpayment.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
very
outset,
the
city
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
it
fully
understands
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
atchison.
the
city
of
chicago
does
not
urge
upon
this
court
any
change
or
modification
whatsoever
in
the
opinion
enunciated
in
atchison
versus
chicago,
357
u.s.
77.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
at
pages
88
and
89,
the
city
retains
considerable
authority
to
regulate
how
transfer
vehicles
shall
be
operated.
it
could
hardly
be
denied
for
example,
that
such
vehicles
must
obey
traffic
signals,
speed
limits,
and
other
general
safety
regulations.
similarly,
the
city
may
require
registration
of
these
vehicles
and
exact
reasonable
fees
for
their
use
of
the
city
streets.
all
we
hold
here
and
all
we
construe
the
court
of
appeals
as
holding
is
that
the
city
has
no
power
to
decide
whether
transfer
can
operate
a
motor
vehicle
service
between
terminals
for
the
railroads
because
this
service
is
an
integral
part
of
interstate
railroad
transportation
authorized
and
subject
to
regulation
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
is
not
the
city
which
is
attempting
to
avoid
this
court's
opinion
in
atchison,
but
rather
it
is
railroad
transfer
which
has
been
dissatisfied
with
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
in
atchison
which
struck
down
only
section
28-31.1
relating
to
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
sustained
the
entire
remainder
of
the
chapter,
it's
transfer
which
has
begun
this
litigation
anew
in
its
attempt
to
accomplish
what
it
failed
to
accomplish
when
the
first
litigation
took
place.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
point,
mr.
justice
white
that
i'm
attempting
to
make
is
that
throughout
its
briefs,
transfer
argues
that
the
city
of
chicago
is
endeavoring
to
subvert
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
atchison.
in
the
brief,
transfer
argues
that
it
was
a
hostile
city
council,
bent
and
subverting
this
court's
opinion
which
in
a
diehard
effort
to
impair
constitutional
rights
amended
chapter
28
and
inserted
the
provision
relating
to
as
--
transfer
argues
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
convenience
and
necessity
again.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
forget
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice
white
and
perhaps
what
would
the
city
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
perhaps
the
city
was
just
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
court
of
appeals
really
held
that
there
was
no
controversy.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
but
the
question
which
you
presented
to
mr.
mathews
was
really
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
they
said
there
is
no
controversy.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
city
of
chicago
has
issued
all
of
the
licenses
which
transfer
his
applied
for.
what
transfer
was
required
to
present
was
simply
a
one
page
application,
a
one
page
financial
statement,
a
list
of
its
equipment,
its
corporate
charters,
certificate
to
do
business
in
illinois,
its
insurance
policy,
and
its
fees,
and
nothing
more.
and
the
city
of
chicago
issued
all
of
the
licenses
which
transfer
applied
for
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
find
no
controversy.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
your
honor
was
that
relates
to
as
in
the
initial
complaint,
the
city
asserted
that
the
amount
in
controversy
was
not
sufficient
to
give
jurisdiction
that
the
amount
of
fees
that
had
accumulated
was
not
equal
to
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and
then
transfer
amended
and
said
that
they
seek
jurisdiction
based
upon
the
interstate
commerce
clause
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
the
commerce
act.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
courts
said
they
do
have
jurisdiction.
but
the
sequence
of
events
which
led
from
the
district
court
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
this
court
illuminate
with
harsh
clarity
the
insincerity
of
the
arguments
which
transfer
advances
in
the
present
litigation
in
the
district
court.
both
the
complaint
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
indicated
that
transfer
was
concerned
about
the
payment
of
fees.
the
district
court
said
and
i
quote
from
the
record
at
page
133,
“if
i
am
to
find
the
principal
source
of
plaintiff's
claim
of
grievance,
it
is
that
plaintiff
has
required
to
pay
an
annual
license
or
tax
to
the
city
of
chicago
for
the
privilege
of
operating
its
terminal
vehicles
whereas
public
utilities
and
other
companies
carrying
out
a
similar
business
are
not
subject
to
the
same
requirement”.
the
district
court
found
the
classification
was
reasonable
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
then
in
the
court
of
appeals,
transfer
tried
a
new
attack.
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
complained
that
our
ordinance
was
invalid
because
it
did
not
provide
for
some
administrative
hearing
before
there
might
be
consideration
given
to
revocation
of
licenses.
and
it
argued
that
certain
safety
regulations
were
invalid
because
they
required
that
a
vehicle
should
be
of
a
uniform
color
for
example.
and
they
argued
again
that
the
requirement
--
that
the
principal
place
of
business
of
coachmen
be
in
the
city
and
that
their
chauffeurs
be
residents
of
the
city.
all
these
arguments
were
advanced
as
to
the
invalidity
of
the
municipal
code
of
chicago.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
city's
position
is
that
the
record
does
not
show
whether
section
28-6
was
applied
to
transfer.
the
reason
i'm
sure
that
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
or
not
it
was
applied
was
that
this
argument
was
not
the
issue
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
down
the
district
court.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
in
regard
to
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice,
in
regard
to
your
specific
question,
the
city
in
its
brief
was
attempting
to
contradict
transfer,
not
concede
that
qualified
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
coachman
was
not
applicable.
the
city
was
attempting
to
deny
that
the
interpretation
of
that
phrase
is
correct.
the
city
takes
the
position
that
section
28-6
must
be
read
as
a
unity.
and
the
first
sentence
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
mr.
justice,
i
--
really
and
truly,
i'm
not
trying
not
to
evade
your
question.
but
the
record
does
not
show
whether
or
not
it
was
applied.
if
it
were
to
be
applied,
it
must
be
applied
in
accordance
with
the
entire
section
so
that
if
this
section
28-6
is
read
in
its
entirely,
the
word
qualified
means
that
the
commissioner
finds
that
the
applicant
is
a
law
abiding
citizen
with
financial
ability
to
carry
on
safe
and
comfortable
service,
maintain
and
replaces
equipment
and
pay
his
judgments.
this
is
the
list
of
qualifications.
and
in
this
context,
yes,
the
provision
applies.
it
can
only
be
read
together
what
counsel
for
transfer
is
attempting
to
present
to
the
court
as
an
interpretation
which
separates
the
first
sentence
of
section
28-6
from
the
second
sentence.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
the
first
sentence
would
be
meaningless
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
mr.
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
what
the
section
says
is
that
the
public
vehicle
commissioner
shall
determine
if
the
documents
that
must
be
filed
are
properly
executed
and
determine
if
the
applicant
is
qualified.
and
the
lists
of
qualifications
are
those
that
are
set
out
in
the
first
sentence.
he
must
determine
whether
his
character
and
reputation
is
that
of
a
law
abiding
citizen.
he
must
determine
that
he
has
the
financial
ability
to
render
safe
and
comfortable
service.
he
must
determine
that
he
is
able
to
maintain
and
replace
the
equipment
for
such
service
and
pay
judgments
that
arise
in
the
conduct
of
his
business.
these
are
the
lists
of
qualifications.
if
he
meets
these
qualifications,
he
does
not
get
a
contract
to
work
for
the
railroads.
he
gets
his
licenses.
and
this
is
one
of
the
essential
fallacies
of
transfer's
argument
is
that
there
is
a
basic
distinction
between
the
city's
attempt
to
regulate
whether
a
particular
terminal
vehicle
service
can
operate
which
is
clearly
unconstitutional
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
if
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
the
word
that
was
added
was
to
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
cabman
or
coachman
whereas
in
the
past,
it
read,
if
he's
qualified
as
a
cabman,
i
believe.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
now
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
the
reason
for
the
insertion
is
a
very
simple
explanation
and
it's
so
unsophisticated
that
it's
hard
to
present
the
city
of
chicago
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
city
of
chicago
has
these
categories
of
licensees,
cabman
which
includes
taxicab
operators
and
every
vehicle
operators
and
sightseeing
buses
and
terminal
vehicles.
now
what
the
city
did
at
the
time
it
was
amending
this
law
was
to
separate
cabman
from
all
others
because
we
have
well
over
5000
taxicabs
in
chicago
and
that's
the
bulk
of
our
regulation.
then
we
took
the
word
coachman
and
defined
it
to
include
busman,
delivery
vehicles,
and
terminal
vehicles.
we
no
longer
have
a
definition
for
the
word
busman.
that
was
completely
dropped
out
of
the
ordinance.
it's
not
covered
by
coachman.
the
word
coachman
was
inserted
here
simply
to
make
it
clear
that
this
is
the
universal
inclusive
of
public
passenger
vehicles.
it
includes
cabman.
it
includes
coachman.
it's
another
way
of
saying
it
includes
taxicabs,
delivery
vehicles,
sightseeing
buses,
and
terminal
vehicles.
and
that
is
all
that
this
section
was
amended
to
change.
it's
a
very
bland
amendment.
but
what
counsel
has
attempted
to
do
is
to
make
equivalent
to
public
convenience
and
necessity,
the
use
of
the
simple
words
pursue
the
occupation
of
a
coachman.
now
the
city
contends
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
perhaps
it
would
clarify
it
somewhat,
mr.
justice
black
to
say
that
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
occupation
which
we
may
focus
on.
one
is
the
aspect
of
operating
the
vehicles
on
the
streets
of
the
city
of
chicago.
that's
pursuing
the
occupation
of
a
coachman.
another
aspect
is
contracting
with
the
railroads
to
do
their
business
for
them.
now
the
city
maintains
that
this
court
said,
“we
could
not
--
we
could
regulate
how
they
maintain
their
vehicles”.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
absolutely
not.
that's
precisely
what
this
court
told
us
we
could
not
do.
and
we
contend
we're
not
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
if
he
doesn't
obtain
a
license,
we'll
file
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
if
he
does
not
obtain
a
license,
we'll
file
a
lawsuit
to
compel
him,
to
take
out
a
license
and
pay
us
the
fees
because
we
have
a
right
to
know
that
their
vehicles
are
safe.
this
court
has
held
that
that
right
is
permitted
to
cities
and
unless
they
come
in
and
submit
their
vehicles
for
testing
and
take
out
a
license
after
they
show
their
qualifications
to
the
city,
we
won't
know
whether
the
vehicles
are
safe
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
and
this
is
an
obligation
which
we
owe
to
the
people
of
chicago.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
railroads
don't
operate
on
the
streets
of
the
city.
mr.
justice,
i'm
sure
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
do
operate
through
our
city.
there's
no
question
that
they
do
but
you
see
railroad
terminal
is
a
unique
kind
of
interstate
operator.
its
sole
business
is
limited
to
one
or
two
square
miles
within
the
center
of
the
city
of
chicago.
it
never
leaves
our
city.
it
operates
its
business
completely
upon
the
city
streets.
and
this
court
has
always
held
that
there's
a
balancing
between
the
inconvenience
to
the
interstate
carrier
and
the
benefit
to
occur
to
the
public.
and
we
maintain
when
their
whole
business
is
derived
from
transporting
passengers
on
the
city
streets.
we
have
a
right
to
impose
reasonable
safety
regulations
and
collect
fees
for
that.
and
we
believe
that's
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
atchison.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice,
that's
true.
we
do
not
believe
that
we
can
prevent
transfer
from
operating.
what
we
do
believe
we
have
a
right
to
do,
if
they
refused
to
take
out
licenses,
if
they
just
take
the
position
that
they're
an
interstate
carrier,
we'll
have
absolutely
no
regulation
from
chicago,
we'll
file
a
lawsuit
and
we'll
ask
the
court
to
order
them
to
meet
the
qualifications
of
our
ordinance,
to
submit
their
vehicles
for
testing
and
to
show
that
they
are
law
abiding
citizens
with
financial
ability
to
maintain
safe
and
comfortable
service
and
to
maintain
and
replace
their
equipment.
that's
the
city's
position,
mr.
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
we
contend
that
this
is
not
an
issue
in
this
litigation
because
the
allegation
and
the
complaint
of
transfer
states
that
they're
a
delaware
corporation
with
their
principal
place
of
business
in
the
city
of
chicago.
and
we
maintain
that
it
is
because
their
business
involves
transporting
passengers
from
one
railway
station
in
chicago
to
another
railway
station
in
chicago
that
accounts
for
their
residents
and
their
principal
place
of
business
being
in
the
city
and
that
in
a
requirement
of
our
ordinance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
is
in
the
sense
that
it
was
litigated
in
the
bulks
(ph)
case
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
in
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
it
in
this
litigation
in
which
they
articulate
the
expression
of
accessible
responsibility.
and
by
that
expression
they
mean
that
if
the
residents
reside
within
the
city,
they're
within
the
reach
of
those
investigative
and
police
officials
who
have
as
their
business
supervising
the
conduct
of
taxicab
and
railway
transfer
vehicles
in
the
city.
their
residents
will
be
within
the
reach
of
those
officials
who
have
business
with
them.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
we
consider
this
charge
to
be
equal
to
the
cost
to
the
city
to
offset
the
administration
of
the
licensing
provision.
in
other
words,
the
amount
of
money
which
is
paid
to
the
city
is
equal
to
what
it
costs
the
city
to
have
clerks
to
process
the
paper
and
to
have
men
to
test
their
vehicles.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
it
was
cast
in
that
regard
historically,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
material
if
it
were
on
either
manner.
it
was
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
license
fee?
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
charge?
i
believe
its
$40
for
a
seven-passenger
vehicle.
that's
$40
for
a
seven-passenger
vehicle.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
your
honor
but
the
city
--
the
section
relates
to
all
of
the
public
vehicles
in
the
city
of
chicago,
cabman
and
coachman
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
it
could
file
a
lawsuit
and
attempt
to
charge
a
penalty,
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
that's
correct.
criminal
in
the
sense
of
fine,
there's
no
imprisonment
for
operating
without
a
license.
it's
a
fine,
i
believe,
of
a
maximum
of
$200.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice,
no.
that
section
that
you're
alluding
to
i
believe
is
section
28-30.1,
am
i
correct?
is
that
what
you're
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
but
what
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
we
take
the
position
that
that
section
does
not
relate
to
transfer.
that
section
is
28-30.1.
it
has
not
been
applied
to
transfer.
there's
no
showing
in
the
record
that
it
applies
to
transfer.
and
it's
inserted
in
our
ordinance
in
the
section
that
relates
to
the
fixing
of
fees
for
taxicabs.
it's
the
section
that
relates
to
rates.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
the
word
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
these
are
the
provisions
of
the
section
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
which
we
contend
does
not
apply.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
when
we
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
we
believe
that
there's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice,
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
but
its
important
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice,
there
are
no
other
vehicles
in
the
entire
city
of
chicago
like
railroad
transfer's
vehicles.
railroad
transfer
is
a
unique
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
or
at
least
unusual.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
no
mr.
justice,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
the
city
would
contend
that
but
the
railroad
trains
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
do
not
operate
on
the
city
streets.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
this
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
this
interstate
vehicle
makes
its
sole
living
from
the
use
of
the
streets
of
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice,
they
own
their
own
railroad
right
away.
they
do
no
travel
upon
the
city
streets
and
make
their
entire
business
from
transporting
passengers
and
baggage
over
the
city
streets.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
buses
are
not
within
the
range
of
the
city's
ordinance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
because
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
because
our
state
commission
has
preempted
the
regulation
of
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
because
the
city's
authority
to
regulate
does
not
extend
beyond
its
corporate
limits.
and
this
interstate
carrier
operates
solely
within
the
municipality
of
the
city
of
chicago.
its
entire
business
is
conducted
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
we
do
not
have,
unless
you
would
look
upon
our
mass
transportation
system
as
that
kind
of
a
railroad
and
even
that
extends
into
the
entire
county
area.
we
do
not
have
an
interstate
railroad.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
our
state
commission?
i
don't
know
the
answer,
mr.
justice.
the
city
of
chicago
does
not.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice,
the
record
shows
that
the
city
of
chicago
issued
all
of
the
licenses
which
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
transfer
applied
for
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
are
you
addressing
the
question
to
section
28-6?
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
record
is
absolutely
silent
on
whether
that
section
has
been
applied.
and
the
reason
of
silent
is
that
it
was
not
the
issue
in
the
trial
court
wherever
the
--
where
evidence
was
taken.
our
position
is
that
if
it
does
apply,
it
must
be
applied
in
the
sense
of
the
qualifications
being
those
set
out
in
the
first
sentence
relating
to
safety
requirement.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
know
--
i
know
now
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
know
now
mr.
justice
what
you're
referring
to.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
was
a
letter
written
by
the
public
vehicle
license
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
commissioner
when
transfer
did
not
apply
for
licenses.
and
it
was
a
letter
which
was
not
a
work
of
art
written
by
attorneys.
it
was
a
letter
which
in
essence
said,
pay
up
or
stop
doing
business
in
the
city
of
chicago.
the
city
of
chicago
does
take
the
position
that
we
will
not
and
that
we
cannot
stop
transfer
from
operating
because
as
mr.
justice
black
points
out
they
are
an
interstate
carrier.
and
you
told
us
in
the
atchison
decision
that
we
could
not
decide
whether
they
can
operate.
all
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
decide
how
they
operate
their
vehicles.
in
our
ordinance
we
contend
relates
to
safety
requirements.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
it
is.
it
is
in
the
record
and
the
letter
does
say,
“apply
for
your
licenses
and
pay
the
fees
or
cease-and-desist
doing
business.
we
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
say
a
license
is
required
but
we
deny
that
the
way
in
which
we'll
enforce
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
they
--
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
the
first
sentence.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
those
are
the
qualifications.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
no,
no.
the
payment
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
payment
of
fees
and
so
on
but
no
other
qualifications,
that's
correct.
the
qualifications
are
set
out
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
in
those
three
phrases.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
city
of
chicago
would
not
stop
them.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
order
them
to
comply
with
our
ordinance.
i
think
mr.
justice
that
the
gist
of
our
ordinance
is
that
we
want
them
to
submit
their
vehicles
so
we
can
have
a
safety
test.
we
want
them
to
carry
insurance
so
that
the
public
will
be
protected.
we
want
them
to
be
law
abiding
citizens
so
that
the
management
will
be
responsible.
that's
in
essence
what
that
section
relates
to.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
(inaudible)
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
think
the
financial
ability
would
be
satisfied
by
the
showing
that
they
carry
insurance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct
because
it
wasn't
litigated.
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no
because
we
don't
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
debate
the
question
that
this
is
a
link
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
we
do
not
deny
that
it
is.
no,
we
don't.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
they
are
--
i
think
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they're
really
unique
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they're
in
a
unique
situation,
mr.
justice
douglas
because
they're
not
regulated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
same
way
that
other
interstate
transportation
companies
are.
they
don't
test
their
vehicles.
they
don't
subject
them
to
the
requirements.
but
they
are
deemed
a
link
in
interstate
commerce
and
they
are
clothed
with
that
protection
of
interstate
business.
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice,
we
do
not
make
that
concession.
it's
unfortunate
that
the
use
of
the
italics
confuses
the
intention
of
the
city.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
on
page
16
in
the
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
our
brief.
it
says,
“the
city”,
and
it's
in
italics,
“the
city
specifically
denies
that
transfer
must
“prove
annually
that
it
is
qualified”.
we
mean
--
we
deny
their
interpretation
that
they
prove
that
they're
qualified
to
contract
with
the
railroads
to
perform
their
interstation
business.
we
do
maintain
they
must
annually
prove
they're
qualified
by
showing
that
they're
law
abiding,
that
they
have
sufficient
financial
ability
to
carry
on
safe
and
comfortable
service.
in
other
words,
the
qualifications
that
are
in
the
first
sentence
of
section
28-6
do
apply
the
assertion
that
we
are
interested
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
interstate
business
is
qualified
to
work
for
the
railroads,
we
categorically
denied.
what
we're
saying
in
the
section
that
as
transfer
interprets
that
language,
we
denied
that
they
ever
annually
or
ever
must
prove
they're
qualified.
as
the
language
is
clearly
set
out
in
section
28-6
which
relates
to
financial
ability
not
section
30.1
which
mr.
mathews
alludes
to,
as
the
section
is
set
out
in
28-6,
we
do
assert
that
it's
applicable
to
transfer
and
we
use
the
italics
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
it
was
their
interpretation.
reading
the
section
completely
disassociated
with
the
first
sentence
that
we
denied.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
what
other
concession?
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
no,
that
is
not
another
concession
because
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
section
28-6
uses
the
word
financial
responsibility.
that
section
is
applicable
to
transfer.
section
30.1
which
requires
the
furnishing
of
financial
data
relates
to
cab
companies
and
is
intended
to
apply
to
fixing
of
rates
and
does
not
apply
to
transfer.
so
we're
not
making
a
concession
that
28-6
does
not
apply
when
we
say
that
they
do
not
have
to
furnish
the
detailed
financial
records
that
are
covered
by
30.1.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
what
they
did
in
the
present
instance
was
to
furnish
a
one
page
financial
statement
showing
their
balance,
the
value
of
their
equipment,
and
the
outstanding
liabilities.
and
nothing
more
was
required
of
them.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
that's
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
my
opinion
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
my
opinion
their
licenses
would
be
issued
if
they
had
insurance.
the
requirement
of
showing
financial
ability
was
satisfied
by
showing
of
a
simple
six-line
financial
statement.
i
don't
think
the
city
would
insist
upon
any
specific
dollar
balance.
i
think
we
ask
for
the
statement
simply
to
see
what
it
says,
to
see
if
they
have
hundreds
of
tort
judgments
outstanding
against
them
for
running
over
passengers
and
pedestrians
in
the
city.
then
we
called
to
the
attention
of
the
railroads
the
kind
of
contracting
party
they're
operating
with.
then
we
might
file
a
lawsuit
and
attempt
to
enjoin
them
from
operating.
that's
what
we
mean
by
the
section.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
and
if
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
if
they
were
preempt
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
but
mr.
justice
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
believe
they
would,
yes.
i
believe
they
would
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
city
cannot
exercise
regulatory
powers
if
they
relate
to
safety
in
the
same
areas
as
the
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
the
section
as
i
point
out
mr.
justice
relates
to
the
entire
ambit
of
public
passenger
vehicle
operators.
cabman
and
coachman
include
every
public
passenger
vehicle.
transfer
has
20
vehicles
and
as
included
in
that
section.
it
was
not
designed
primarily
for
them.
it
applies
to
them,
and
we
think
the
application
is
reasonable
and
should
be
sustained
but
the
use
of
the
license
is
because
we
have
over
5000
taxicabs,
several
hundred
delivery
vehicles,
a
dozen
or
more
sightseeing
vehicles
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
all
of
which
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
no.
no,
your
honor.
the
section
relates
to
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
this
section
that
we're
debating
mr.
justice
relates
only
to
safety
requirements.
and
this
court
has
said,
we
could
impose
safety
requirements
upon
transfer.
and
this
court
told
us
in
the
same
sentence
that
transfer
was
an
interstate
carrier.
in
the
opening
section
which
i
quoted
in
this
argument
where
it
said,
“all
we
hold
is
that
the
city
cannot
determine
whether
or
not
transfer
operates
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
this
court
said,
“all
we
hold
in
atchison
and
all
we
construed
the
court
of
appeals
is
holding
is
that
the
city
cannot
determine
whether
transfer
may
operate
for
the
city
retains
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
considerable
authority
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
to
regulate
how
they
operate”.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice,
the
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
take
the
position
that
we
cannot
stop
him
from
operating.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
would
have
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we've
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
filed
a
lawsuit
if
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
if
the
court
ordered
that
he
was
willfully
refusing
to
submit
his
vehicles
for
a
safety
test,
and
if
he
refused
to
do
that,
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
believe
the
court
could
order
it.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well
we
could
fine
him
up
to
$200
under
the
law.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
if
he
refuse
to
pay
that
fine
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
oh
surely,
your
honor,
we
have
no
authority
in
the
city
of
chicago
to
punish
by
imprisonment.
the
only
authority
we
have
for
a
violation
of
city
ordinances
is
to
punish
by
fine.
we
have
no
authority
to
imprison.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
then
they
can
be
imprisoned
up
to
six
months
for
nonpayment.
