chief

was
the
fact
of
the
recording
known
to
either

either
side
of
the

chief

may
i
ask
who
of
course
suggested
that
the
two
meet,
hoffa
and
partin?
chief
justice
earl
warren
one,
i
believe
someone
said
about
a
manslaughter
charge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
they
allege
the
crime
was
committed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
quite
understand
what
you
said
--
when
you
said
you
could
not
maintain
that
--
what
was
the
relationship
of
this
man
to
the
government?
was
he
an
agent,
was
he
an
undercover
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
was
he
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
that,
i
asked
you
if
he
was
more
of
an
informer.
was
he
an
undercover
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
--
was
--
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
mean
that
payroll,
what
--
were
--
was
he
compensated
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
their
voucher
is
showing
that
he
spent
that
money
and
was
paid
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
the
money
happen
to
be
paid
to
the
wife
instead
of
--
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
these
were
paid
to
--
these
payments
were
made
to
her
month
by
month,
were
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
each
month
there
was
a
payment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
during
the
time
but
the
payments
were
made.
they
were
made
from
month
to
month.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
how
did
you
know
that
this
was
going
to
amount
to
so
much,
i
understood
you
to
say
when
it
was
all
over,
the
way
you
figured
it
out
roughly
was
about
$1500
so
paid
in
twelve.
how
did
you
know
that
it
would
come
to
$300
a
month
as
you
went
along
before
you
got
that
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
pay
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
was
a
paid
government
agent,
would
you
be
in
any
different
position
than
you
are
here
today?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vinson,
do
you
happen
to
have
the
page
number
of
that
conversation
where
mr.
twill
told
him
that
he
had
come
down
to
--
at
the
jury
or
depicts
a
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
day
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
status
of
the
other
two
that
are
not
here,
mr.
vinson?
you
don't
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vinson,
may
i
ask
you
this
just
to
clear
up
something
in
my
own
mind.
if
we
should
conclude
that
partin
was
a
paid
representative
of
the
government
for
the
purpose
of
getting
into
the
counsels
of
the
defense,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vinson,
i
wonder
if
you
would
consider
an
obstruction
of
justice
if
a
defendant
was
to
employ
someone
to
secretly
get
into
the
counsels
of
the
government
and
to
sit
with
them
in
their
deliberations
during
the
state
--
during
the
trial
and
then
report
to
what
was
--
what
went
on
back
to
him,
disclosing
government
secrets.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
consider
that
an
obstruction
of
justice
even
though
he
said
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
have
the
opinion
that
they
were
going
to
violate
my
constitutional
rights
so
i
employed
someone
to
go
in
there
and
know
what
was
going
on
to
see
if
they
were
actually
doing
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
we
know
what
the
government
knew
as
a
result
of
parin's
disclosures
to
it
and
how
do
we
know
what
it
--
what
might
have
helped
them
promote
disclosures
in
a
strategy
in
their
case?
it
isn't
just
a
fact
that
they
introduced
testimony
concerning
statements
but
how
can
the
court
know
if
you
have
someone
from
the
other
side
sitting
in
on
your
counsels?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
it
was
his
brother?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
said
this
man
was
a
friend
of
his
and
therefore
he
was
welcome
in
his
quarters,
now
would
it
make
any
difference
if
it
--
we
were
so
close
to
him
as
a
brother
would
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
the
government
had
that
relationship
with
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
make
any
difference,
would
it?
chief
