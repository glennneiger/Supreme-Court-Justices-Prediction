mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
if
i
may
have
just
a
moment?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
in
behalf
of
all
the
petitioners
in
the
four
individual
appeals
which
are
consolidated
for
argument
today.
they
are
petitioners
hoffa,
king,
campbell
and
parks.
these
four
petitioners
were
convicted
in
one
joint
trial
on
charges
of
jury
tampering.
to
the
affirmance
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
those
convictions,
this
court
granted
certiorari
upon
one
question.
that
question
reads
and
i
quote
whether
evidence
obtained
by
the
government
by
means
of
deceptively
placing
a
secret
informer
in
the
quarters
and
counsels
of
the
defendant
during
one
criminal
trial
so
violates
the
defendant's
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
that
suppression
of
such
evidence
is
required
in
a
subsequent
trial
of
the
same
defendant
on
a
different
charge.
the
phrases
used
in
this
question
upon
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
made
more
intelligible
by
placing
them
in
the
context
of
the
particular
facts
presented
by
these
cases
or
by
this
case,
really.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
the
question
refers
to
two
criminal
trials.
the
first
of
these
was
the
trial
of
petitioner
hoffa
in
nashville
on
a
criminal
charge,
a
misdemeanor
charge
of
violating
the
labor
management
relations
act.
that
trial
started
on
october
22,
1962
and
continued
on
into
december
of
1962.
that
trial
ended
with
a
hung
jury.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes
sir.
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
the
shorthand
reference
throughout
this
argument
i
shall
refer
to
it
as
the
test
fleet
case
or
the
test
fleet
trial
or
the
test
fleet
offense
whichever.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
the
second
trial
of
the
two
trials
referred
to
in
the
question
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
is
of
course
the
trial
in
this
proceeding.
that
trial
began
and
ended
in
1964.
in
that
trial,
the
petitioners
were
convicted
of
tampering
with
the
jury
in
the
test
fleet
case
which
had
occurred
in
nashville
in
1962
from
october
22
then
to
december.
the
question
refers
to
a
deceptively
placed
secret
informer.
that
reference
is
to
one
edward
partin.
that
is
p-a-r-t-i-n.
it
refers
to
evidence
obtained
by
the
government.
this
means
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
incriminating
statements,
admission
statements
allegedly
made
by
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
during
the
course
of
the
test
fleet
trial
in
1962.
these
as
testified
to
by
partin
in
this
proceeding
secured
the
conviction
of
petitioners.
beginning
with
october
22,
1962,
the
opening
date
of
the
test
fleet
trial,
partin
according
to
his
testimony
in
this
proceeding
heard
and
in
summons,
he
said
overheard
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
that
he
claimed
in
this
proceeding.
some
of
them
he
heard
and
some
of
them
he
overheard
in
the
hotel
suite
which
petitioner
hoffa
occupied
in
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
in
nashville
during
the
whole
course
of
the
test
fleet
trial
and
which
served
during
the
course
of
that
trial
both
as
his
home
and
as
the
headquarters
for
his
defense
in
the
test
fleet
case.
finally,
in
providing
context
for
the
question
presented
here,
we
identify
two
government
officials,
department
of
justice
officials.
one
you've
already
heard
a
little
about.
that
is
walter
sheridan,
a
non-lawyer
layman
who
was
assisting
in
the
preparation
and
prosecution
of
the
test
fleet,
the
government's
test
fleet
case
in
nashville
in
1962.
the
other
department
of
justice
official
involved
in
this
case
is
mr.
frank
grimsley,
a
lawyer
in
the
criminal
division
of
the
department
of
justice
generally
stationed
in
atlanta,
georgia
who
was
at
all
of
the
relevant
times
to
this
argument
mr.
sheridan's
subordinate.
the
question
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
presents
five
constitutional
issues.
three
of
those
issues
they
are
points
roman
i,
ii
and
v
of
our
brief,
i
will
cover
in
this
oral
argument
in
the
following
order.
first,
we
urge
that
many
of
the
statements,
incriminating
statements,
allegedly
obtained
by
party
from
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
were
barred
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
the
immediate
product
of
numerous
illegal
entries
made
by
secret
government
agent
partin
into
petitioner
office
home
suite
without
a
warrant
and
when
looking
for
evidence
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activities.
as
we
understand
the
government's
position,
the
government
does
not
deny
the
illegality
of
partin's
repeated
entries
into
petitioner
hoffa's
home
suite
throughout
the
duration
of
the
test
fleet
trial.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
we
say
they
were
illegal
because
as
i
will
develop
in
further
detail
on
this
argument
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
say
that
they
were
illegal
because
he
was
a
government
agent
which
was
being
hidden
at
the
time
of
these
entries
into
a
home
for
the
purpose
of
looking
for
evidence
that
they
were
therefore
illegal
because
if
the
government
agrees
with
us
an
entry
into
a
home
without
a
warrant
by
deception
and
an
entry
into
a
home
without
a
warrant
by
force
are
equivalents
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
view
of
gouled
and
the
(inaudible)
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
if
he
comes
to
the
door
as
the
helper
of
the
household
in
the
preparation
of
his
defense
and
as
his
union
colleague
but
at
the
same
time
is
and
is
hiding
his
identity
as
a
government
secret
agent.
now,
if
your
use
of
the
phrase
mr.
justice
stewart,
a
private
detective
not
connected
with
the
government.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
but
connected
with
the
government,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes,
if
he
hit
the
entrance
with
deception
and
concealed
his
identity
as
a
police,
we're
not
--
this
opposition
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
your
honor,
what
they
do
as
we
understand
it,
and
i
will
advert
further
to
this
in
the
course
of
my
argument,
they
at
no
point
deny
the
illegality
of
the
entry.
they
go
further
than
that
and
state
that
in
view
of
the
illegal
entry
had
he
been
hiding
in
a
closet
these
admissions
would
have
been
inadmissible
but
that
the
illegality
of
the
entry
is
immaterial
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
statements
was
directed
to
him
which
i
will
come
into
further
detail
later
mr.
justice
harlan.
as
i
have
already
noted
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
the
government
specifically
concedes
that
force
is
the
equivalent
of
fraud
for
the
purpose
of
fourth
amendment
entries
into
a
home
and
it
concedes
further
that
the
fourth
--
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
extends
to
verbal
statements
although
they
argue
as
i
will
note
later
not
this
type
of
reference.
second,
we
urge
that
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
testified
to
by
partin
were
barred
by
the
sixth
amendment
as
the
very
product
and
the
very
objective
of
partin's
intrusion
as
a
secret
government
agent
into
petitioner
office
defense
of
the
test
fleet
case.
the
government
admits
in
its
brief
and
this
is
not
our
understanding
of
it
but
a
specific
admission
of
the
government
that
sheridan
knowingly
risked
precisely
such
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
in
other
words,
as
we
logically
understand
the
government's
position,
the
question
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
at
least
so
far
as
it
concerns
the
sixth
amendment
is
conceded
in
our
favor
if
that
question
as
stated
accurately
reflects
the
record
and
finally,
in
this
oral
argument
we
will
urge
that
the
testimony
was
barred,
the
incriminated
statements
as
the
product
of
a
--
i've
forgotten
the
phrase
but
mr.
lewin
used
this
morning
as
the
product
of
a
whole
course
of
government
conduct
contrary
to
the
standards
of
fundamental
fairness
required
by
the
due
process
clause.
the
remaining
two
issues,
they
are
points
three
and
four
of
our
brief
are
concerned
with
sixth
amendment
rights
that
counsel
with
respect
to
this
proceeding
rather
than
the
test
fleet
case
and
with
fifth
amendment
rights
against
self-incrimination
with
respect
--
directly
with
respect
to
this
proceeding
rather
than
the
test
fleet
case
and
these
if
your
honors
please,
we
submit
on
our
brief.
the
facts
which
must
guide
and
govern
decision
on
all
the
constitutional
issues
presented
are
the
same.
at
the
outset
of
a
summary
event,
we
should
recall
the
identity
of
the
principle
persons
who
play
a
role
in
those
facts.
petitioner
hoffa
of
course
is
the
defendant
on
trial
in
the
test
fleet
case
beginning
on
october
22,
1962
and
continuing
on
trial
into
the
december
of
that
year.
mr.
sheridan
is
the
department
of
justice
official
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
who
was
in
nashville
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial
assisting
in
the
preparation
and
prosecution
of
a
government's
case.
mr.
grimsley,
his
subordinate,
mr.
grimsley,
a
lawyer,
his
subordinate
generally
stationed
in
atlanta
from
the
criminal
division
of
the
department
of
justice
and
edward
partin
is
no
sort
a
policeman
mr.
chief
justice
either
state
or
federal
at
the
opening
of
these
facts.
he
is
a
local
teamster
union
official
in
baton
rouge
but
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
test
fleet
trial
on
october
22,
he
indubitably
became
as
the
detail
of
facts
i
will
recite
in
a
moment
would
show.
he
indubitably
became
the
government
secret
agent
and
acted
as
such
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial.
the
opening
scene
of
the
facts
is
in
late
september
1962.
it
finds
party
in
a
baton
rouge
jail,
local
state
jail
upon
a
charge
of
kidnapping
with
bail
having
been
denied.
at
the
same
time,
partin
is
facing
a
26
count
federal
indictment
for
embezzlement
and
state
charges
of
man
slaughter
and
forgery.
being
so
situated
in
late
september
of
1962,
partin
tells
the
local
state
officials
a
story
of
a
plot
in
the
preceding
summary
by
petitioner
hoffa
to
assassinate
the
then
attorney
general
robert
kennedy
and
partin
as
to
speak
with
the
federal
officials.
as
a
result,
partin
meets
with
grimsley,
the
department
of
justice
criminal
lawyer,
a
lawyer
in
the
criminal
division
at
two
conferences
in
early
october
held
in
the
officers
of
the
local
state
prosecutor
between
midnight
and
dawn
on
two
mornings.
these
conferences
were
held
at
these
unusual
hours
to
hide
the
fact
that
partin
was
an
agent.
as
we
read
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
was
engaging
in
conferences
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
--
with
grimsley,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
and
this
is
not
my
inference
from
the
record.
this
is
specifically
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
that's
right.
apparently,
they
had
the
more
trusted
jailer
at
sunrise
than
the
man
they
had
at
sunset.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
one
of
these
--
you
mean
by
way
of
time
of
day?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
they
were
between
midnight
and
dawn.
now,
as
we
read
grimsley's
testimony
in
this
proceeding,
partin
became
the
government's
informer
at
one
of
these
early
morning
conferences
on
october
8.
now,
the
government
reads
it
otherwise
but
in
any
event,
we
say
it
is
not
of
any
great
materiality
in
this
case
because
as
we
shall
see
in
a
moment
in
detail,
there
is
absolutely
no
question
on
this
record
that
partin
agreed
with
grimsley
in
atlanta
on
october
20th,
two
days
before
the
test
fleet
case
started
that
he
would
report
evidence
of
illegal
activity,
jury
tampering,
witness
intimidation
or
anything
else
of
interest
to
the
government.
but
to
go
back
to
the
chronology
of
the
facts,
within
a
few
days
of
these
early
morning
conferences,
partin
is
released
from
jail.
by
two
long
distance
calls
to
petitioner
hoffa
on
october
8
and
october
18,
partin
successfully
invites
himself
to
nashville
to
meet
with
petitioner
hoffa
on
october
22,
the
opening
day
of
the
test
fleet
trial.
the
ostensible
purpose
of
that
meeting
as
stated
by
partin
in
these
telephone
conversations
and
they
are
in
the
record
was
to
discuss
his
personal
problems
with
petitioner
hoffa.
as
soon
as
partin
knew
that
he
was
going
to
be
in
nashville
on
october
22nd
to
meet
with
hoffa,
he
immediately
advised
grimsley
and
grimsley
advised
sheridan.
sheridan
instructed
grimsley
to
give
his
nashville
telephone
number
to
partin
and
"to
tell
mr.
partin
that
when
he
got
to
nashville,
if
he
saw
any
evidence
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activities
to
call
me."
the
quote
of
course
is
from
sheridan
himself
from
his
testimony
in
this
proceeding.
so
instructed
by
sheridan,
grimsley
got
partin
to
come
from
baton
rouge
to
atlanta
to
confer
with
grimsley
in
atlanta
in
october
28th
which
as
i
have
already
remark
is
two
days
before
the
opening
of
the
test
fleet
trial.
at
that
conference,
partin
agreed
with
grimsley,
to
keep
his
eyes
and
ears
open
in
nashville
and
report
to
sheridan
on
any
attempts
at
witness
intimidation
or
tampering
with
the
jury.
this
is
a
testimony
of
a
local
state
official
who
was
also
present
at
that
conference.
as
grimsley
himself
sums
it
up,
at
that
conference,
he
gave
partin,
and
i
quote.
"instructions
to
keep
his
eyes
and
ears
open
when
he
was
in
nashville
and
if
he
heard
anything
of
interest
to
call
sheridan."
to
use
partin's
words
on
that
conference
on
october
20th
in
nashville
with
immaterial
omissions,
grimsley
"instructed
me
to
discover
or
to
turn
in
evidence
that
would
substantiate
a
violation
of
the
law
or
jury
tampering
or
something
like
that."
and
partin
to
use
his
own
word
for
it
know
that
in
nashville
he
was
to
observe,
this
is
his
word
for
evidence
of
illegal
activities
and
as
--
again
as
partin
himself
puts
it
when
and
before
he
got
to
nashville
to
the
opening
day
of
the
test
fleet
defense,
"i
knew
what
i
was
looking
for."
when
partin
was
ready
to
leave
baton
rouge
to
go
to
nashville
for
his
meeting
with
petitioner
hoffa
on
october
22nd,
he
called
grimsley
to
advise
him
of
this.
on
his
actual
way
to
nashville
from
baton
rouge
when
changing
planes
at
atlanta,
he
called
grimsley
to
tell
him
that
he
was
on
his
way
and
on
his
arrival
in
nashville,
on
october
22nd,
partin
called
sheridan
to
tell
him,
"i
am
here."
the
government
disputes
this
little
fact,
but
record
references
993
and
781
very
surely
substantiate
it.
now,
the
government
took
many
precautions
to
hide
partin's
identity
as
a
secret
agent.
at
the
very
outset
of
the
test
fleet
trial
on
partin's
arrival
in
nashville,
sheridan
instructed
partin
on
how
to
communicate
with
him
in
order
to
make
his
reports
to
sheridan.
partin
was
assigned
with
a
codename
of
andy
or
anderson
and
sheridan
used
the
codename
john
black.
for
detailed
reports
other
than
reports
by
telephone,
sheridan
was
to
pick
up
and
deliver
partin
on
the
street
away
from
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
where
partin
stated
and
where
petitioner
hoffa
occupied
the
hotel
suite
which
served
both
as
his
home
and
as
his
defense
headquarters
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial.
these
arrangements
made
by
sheridan
with
partin
at
the
outset
of
the
test
fleet
trial
held
throughout
the
trial
as
partin
met
with
sheridan
usually
in
his
automobile,
sometimes
in
sheridan's
nashville
apartment
but
through
the
back
door
and
once
in
a
(inaudible).
according
to
partin's
long
distance
call
arrangements
with
hoffa,
petitioner
hoffa,
he
was
to
be
in
nashville
to
meet
with
the
petitioner
on
one
day
october
22,
to
discuss
his
personal
problems
but
partin
stayed
in
nashville
over
some
eight
weeks
for
most
of
the
trial
days
in
the
test
fleet
case
which
started
as
i
have
stated
october
22nd
and
ended
in
december.
to
do
this,
partin
made
11
round
trip
plane
tickets,
plane
trips
from
baton
rouge
to
nashville.
he's
getting
evidence
and
reporting
it
to
sheridan
was
admittedly
on
this
record
a
factor
in
the
process
by
which
his
trip
to
nashville
for
a
meeting
with
petitioner
hoffa
of
one
day
became
11
trips
to
nashville
in
a
period
of
some
eight
weeks.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
that
comes
to
the
question
your
honor
of
whether
compensation
was
paid
to
partin
by
the
government
which
i
will
reach
in
detail
in
a
moment.
there
are
some
disputes
between
it.
i
should
say
in
candor
at
the
same
time
mr.
justice
harlan
that
it
does
appear
in
the
record.
i
don't
know
what
the
trip's
cost
but
it
does
appear
in
the
record
that
he
was
drawing
union
salary
during
this
time
as
a
local
union
official,
teamster
union
official
in
baton
rouge.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
in
baton
rouge,
lousiana,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
let
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
there's
subquestion
about
it
on
this
record
and
i
will
go
into
it
in
detail
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
now,
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
test
fleet
defense
counsel
live
in
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial.
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
served
as
i
have
stated
both
as
his
home
and
as
the
home
in
which
in
conjunction
with
this
counsel
he
was
preparing
and
carrying
on
his
defense
in
the
test
fleet
criminal
prosecution.
in
petitioner
hoffa's
suite,
his
counsel
conferred
with
him
as
to
his
defense,
they
interviewed
prospective
witnesses.
they
prepared
for
the
examination
and
cross
examination
of
witnesses.
they
discussed
questions
of
law,
and
at
the
end
of
each
day
a
process
with
which
all
of
us
lawyers
if
i
may
so
mr.
chief
justice
are
familiar.
they
consider
into
the
night
what
would
be
the
trial
strategy
for
the
next
day.
with
one
minor
exception
when
partin
was
unable
to
get
a
room
on
one
of
his
11
round
trips
to
nashville
when
he
was
unable
to
get
a
room
at
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
with
that
one
exception,
partin
also
stayed
at
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
throughout
the
trial
days
of
the
test
fleet
trial.
on
his
first
day
in
nashville,
partin
went
to
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
and
thereafter
he
was
constantly
hanging
around
that
suite.
in
the
suite,
he
got
people
ashtrays,
he
moved
chairs
in
the
suite
for
the
participants
discussing
their
defense
and
he
acted
as
doorman
to
the
suite,
sitting
on
occasion,
outside,
just
outside
the
suite
and
on
occasion
just
inside
the
suite.
he
even
went
so
far
has
to
deliver
the
morning
newspapers,
the
early
morning
newspapers.
according
to
partin
himself,
when
he
was
acting
as
doorman,
petitioner
hoffa
"would
tell
me
a
lot
of
things
that
didn't
pertain
to
the
jury."
with
defense
counsel
in
court
everyday
in
the
course
of
the
test
fleet
defense,
partin
was
there
everyday
too.
he
ate
with
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
counsel
and
went
to
--
back
and
forth
from
meals
in
the
courthouse
with
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
counsel.
in
some
as
the
detailed
facts
show
and
there's
six
counsel
who
participated
in
the
test
fleet
defense
testified
and
we
say
without
contradiction
in
this
record
the
government
says
there
was
a
contradiction
but
at
partin's
testimony
as
examined
he
never
squarely
denies
any
of
this.
he
doesn't
remember.
he
wasn't
interested.
he
has
no
recollection.
as
these
six
attorneys
testified,
partin
had
an
access
to
the
defense
counsel
and
partin
participated
in
and
associated
with
defense
counsel
when
defense
matters
and
defense
strategy
were
under
discussion.
the
record
is
replete
with
examples.
partin
was
present
when
defense
counsel
interviewed
a
number
of
prospective
witnesses
in
the
test
fleet
case.
he
helped
assemble
typewritten
statements
of
their
testimony,
of
their
expected
testimony
as
sheridan
explicitly
admitted
he
told
sheridan
about
it
and
as
the
record
sufficiently
indicates
sheridan
told
the
government
prosecutor,
the
man
actually
on
the
floor
handling
the
government's
case
in
the
test
fleet.
partin
discussed
the
selection
of
the
jury
with
petitioner
hoffa
and
heard
counsel,
discussed
it
and
in
this
connection
reported
to
sheridan
that
the
defense
was
investigating
the
prospective
(inaudible)
on
the
jury.
he
heard
one
of
defense
counsel
criticizing
other
defense
counsel
as
to
what
they
were
doing
wrong
in
the
case
and
what
should
be
done
in
correction.
he
was
present
when
the
questions
for
jury
voir
dire
were
distributed
amongst
counsel
and
on
three
separate
occasions
may
it
please
the
court,
he
interrogated
defense
counsel
on
what
--
on
various
aspects
of
trial
strategy
in
the
test
fleet
defense.
partin
himself
volunteers
that
he,"infiltrated"
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
counsel.
as
a
result
of
the
partin
infiltration
of
the
test
fleet
defense,
partin
without
question
got
some
defense
information
which
he
passed
on
to
sheridan
in
the
course
of
his
daily
reports
to
sheridan.
now,
at
this
point
i
might
take
a
moment
to
state,
may
it
please
the
court
that
there
is
some
difference
between
the
government
and
us
as
to
how
much
defense
information
he
passed
on
to
sheridan.
although
the
government
argues
at
first
for
getting
when
they
do
get
on
the
subject,
they
have
to
admit
that
there
was
some
defense
information
passed
on
to
sheridan.
with
all
of
these
going
on,
may
it
please
the
court,
test
fleet
defense
counsel
i
mean
with
all
of
these
going
on,
partin
and
the
petitioner
hoffa's
headquarters
telling
sheridan
what's
taking
place
there
at
the
defense
counsel,
the
defense
counsel's
consultations.
with
all
of
these
going
on
may
it
please
the
court,
test
fleet
defense
counsel
suspected
some
sort
of
government
surveillance
of
the
test
fleet
defense
whether
by
wire
tapping
or
otherwise.
and
as
early
as
november
1,
1962,
just
nine
days
after
this
trial
had
begun
they
complained
to
the
trial
judge
in
test
fleet.
the
government
flatly
denied
surveillance
of
any
shape,
type
or
form.
the
judge
admonished
the
government,
this
is
at
the
test
fleet
trial
court
judge
and
i
quote
his
admonition,
"certainly,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
privacy
in
dealing
with
his
own
counsel
and
in
communicating
with
his
own
counsel."
that
right
will
be
respected.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
government
did
not
come
forward
at
that
time
to
say
to
the
trial
court
judge
as
they
now
in
substance
say
in
their
brief,
your
honor,
we
have
government
secret
agent
partin
in
and
around
the
test
fleet
defense
and
we
know
that
that
risked
a
sixth
amendment
violation
of
his
right
to
the
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel
but
your
honor
we
are
going
to
leave
him
there
nevertheless
because
we
think
this
is
the
way
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
jury.
while
in
nashville,
partin
reported
to
sheridan
on
a
daily
basis
and
from
time
to
time,
he
also
reported
to
grimsley
by
telephone.
neither
sheridan
nor
grimsley
ever
gave
partin
any
definition
or
detail
on
what
is
jury
tampering
or
witness
intimidation
or
other
illegal
activity
or
anything
of
interest,
the
evidence
he
was
to
look
for
in
nashville
and
neither
sheridan
nor
grimsley
ever
told
partin
to
keep
away
from
the
test
fleet
defense
counsels
and
stop
reporting
test
fleet
defense
information
to
sheridan.
so
to
use
of
partin's
own
words,
he
reported
"anything
that
i
would
have
seen."
hence,
partin's
reports
to
sheridan
on
the
results
of
his
activities
in
the
midst
of
the
test
fleet
defense
covered
two
types
of
information.
one,
test
fleet
defense
information,
and
two
the
admissions
of
jury
tampering
which
he
claims
to
have
heard
or
overheard
from
petitioners
hoffa
and
king.
now,
while
partin
was
carrying
on
this
job,
this
course
of
conduct
as
the
government
secret
agent
in
nashville
from
the
very
opening
day
of
the
test
fleet
trial
to
its
very
end,
he
was
at
the
same
time
as
the
government's
secret
informer
and
agent
reporting
to
the
government
on
a
matter
or
a
bribe
of
a
completely
unrelated
government
official
and
an
official
of
national
labors
relations
board.
and
after
the
test
fleet
trial
was
over
and
when
the
grand
jury
inquiry
in
respect
to
this
proceeding
was
in
progress,
partin
as
he
testified
in
the
trial
below
reported
to
sheridan
that
one
of
petitioner
hoffa
counsel
was
advising
all
prospective
grand
jury
witnesses
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment
and
giving
them
a
form
for
the
purpose.
it
is
a
fair
indeed
in
our
view
inescapable
inference
from
this
record
that
partin
in
carrying
on
his
work
as
the
government's
secret
agent
did
exactly
what
the
government
told
them
to
do
no
more
and
no
less.
at
page
701
of
the
record,
partin
says
that
he
did
not
keep
notes
of
the
time,
dates
and
places
of
the
alleged
incriminating
admissions
to
which
he
testified
because
sheridan
did
not
tell
him
to.
at
page
778
of
the
record,
partin
says
that
he
can
precisely
remember
the
claimed
incriminating
admissions
and
not
remember
any
help
discussions
amongst
counsel
of
jury
selection
because
it
was
jury
tampering
that
sheridan
told
him
to
remember.
and
at
page
1011
of
the
record,
partin
revealingly
says
in
connection
with
his
relationship
to
grimsley
and
to
sheridan,
"i
figured
that
they
knew
well
enough
what
they
were
doing
if
it
was
suggested
or
even
hit
it
i
would
have
done
what
they
said
do,
now
i
would
have
some
syntactical
difficulty,"
but
the
"they"
there
in
its
context
is
sheridan
and
grimsley.
i
come
to
the
matter
that
bears
upon
the
question
you
asked
a
few
minutes
ago
mr.
chief
justice
the
matter
of
compensation
to
partin
for
his
work
as
a
government
agent.
it
is
the
fact
in
this
proceeding
that
today
in
the
fall
of
1966,
partin
has
never
been
tried
on
any
of
the
criminal
charges
he
faced
in
late
september
1962.
now,
the
problem
that
offers
a
number
of
explanations
for
each
of
these
and
why
it
wasn't
tried
in
our
view,
we
think
it
may
well
be
a
case
that
the
lady
does
protest
too
much.
it
is
the
further
fact
that
the
department
of
justice
paid
partin's
wife
a
monthly
sum
of
$300.00
for
a
total
of
$1200
in
the
period
after
the
test
fleet
defense,
after
the
close
of
the
test
fleet
trial
and
before
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding.
these
sums
were
in
exactly
the
same
monthly
amounts
as
partin
was
required
by
court
order
to
pay
to
his
wife
for
the
support
of
his
children.
by
written
order
of
mr.
sheridan
in
the
department
of
justice
the
sums
involved
were
paid
out
of
a
confidential
fund
by
check
to
mr.
grimsley,
mr.
grimsley
then
cashed
those
checks
bought
cashier's
checks
and
sent
them
to
mrs.
grimsley
without
showing
in
any
way
the
identity
of
its
sender.
did
i
--
to
mrs.
partin,
sent
them
to
mrs.
partin.
did
i
say
mrs.
grimsley?
it
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue.
grimsley
sent
these
cashier's
checks
to
mrs.
partin.
now,
the
government
says
and
let
me
interpolate
there
is
no
question
about
the
facts
i
have
just
stated
upon
this
record.
but
the
government
says
that
these
payments
in
behalf
partin
to
his
wife
were
made
for
expenses
that
he
incurred
not
in
connection
with
the
plane
trips
that
you
were
inquiring
about
mr.
chief
justice
but
in
connection
with
other
trips
that
he
made
to
various
cities
in
the
country
to
consult
with
department
of
justice
counsel
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
his
testimony
in
this
proceeding.
but
partin
never
submitted
a
statement,
voucher
or
bill
for
any
of
these
claimed
trips
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
connection
with
the
subject
that
i
touched
upon
a
moment
ago
that
the
reason
he
did
not
do
so
is
that
sheridan
didn't
tell
him
to
do
this.
and
secondly,
grimsley
although
he
tried
and
he
made
an
affidavit
i
think
it
appears
in
this
record
sufficiently
indicated
its
original
form
in
the
record,
he
had
about
a
half
sheet
of
paper
and
he
tried
to
relate
these
monthly
payments
to
what
the
trips
might
have
cost.
he
finally
admitted
that
he
was
unable
to
do
this
and
that
the
sums
paid
to
mrs.
partin
was
set
in
exact
accordance
with
the
amounts
that
partin
owed
her
for
the
support
of
his
children
on
the
court
order.
and
finally
in
this
connection,
on
the
matter
of
compensation
of
partin,
grimsley
unguardedly
states
in
another
connection
that
some
of
these
trips
claimed
by
the
government
as
the
basis
of
the
payments
to
partin
to
consult
with
counsel
in
preparation
of
his
testimony
in
this
proceeding
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
just
what
i
said
a
few
minutes
ago
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
as
i
recall
a
record
in
this
case,
it
is
the
fact
that
he
was
withdrawing
salary
from
here.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
evidence
that
they
were
paying
his
expenses?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
precise
point
of
whether
he
was
paid
by
the
union
for
these
trips.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
as
i
recall
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
don't
think
so.
he
was
drawing
his
regular
salary.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
that
is
--
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
mr.
justice.
he
was
drawing
whatever
he
usually
drew
from
the
union.
we
would
say
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
i
have
just
summarized,
on
the
facts
as
to
compensation
that
rather
clearly
partin
was
paid
by
the
government
both
by
way
of
these
checks
to
his
wife
and
by
way
of
--
to
put
it
at
its
mildest,
easy
treatment
on
the
criminal
charges
that
were
pending
against
him,
but
our
basic
contention
is
that
this
question
isn't
very
material
to
this
case
because
the
fact
remains
whether
he
was
paid
or
not
that
partin
was
the
government
secret
agent
before
he
got
to
nashville
and
remained
the
government's
hard
working
and
complaisant
secret
agent
throughout
the
test
fleet
defense.
i
have
taken
considerable
time,
may
it
please
the
court
to
state
these
facts
at
length
in
detail
and
in
their
full
color
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
have
done
so
is
that
the
writers
of
the
government's
brief
in
relation
to
the
facts
of
this
case
tend
to
close
their
eyes,
shut
their
ears,
do
something
like
this
and
argue
this
case
as
if
partin
with
no
prior
connection
with
the
government
as
a
private
visitor
in
petitioner
hoffa's
home
is
entrusted
with
confidences
as
to
jury
tampering
and
as
a
good
citizen
reports
them
to
the
government
but
that
is
not
this
case.
here,
no
matter
how
minor
conflicts
in
the
evidence
may
be
resolved
or
not
resolved
at
all,
the
basic
set
of
facts
are
clear,
partin
contracted
with
grimsley
in
atlanta
on
october
20th
before
the
opening
of
the
test
fleet
trial
to
look
for
jury
tampering
in
nashville.
he
repeatedly
looked
for
evidence
of
jury
tampering
in
nashville.
he
repeatedly
looked
for
such
evidence
in
petitioner
hoffa's
home
and
in
the
same
place
petitioner
hoffa's
defense
headquarters
and
according
to
his
own
testimony
he
there
heard
or
overheard
much
of
what
he
was
looking.
now,
partin
did
not
tell
petitioners
hoffa
or
king
that
he
was
acting
for
the
government
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial.
as
partin
puts
it,
he
did
not
so
tell
them,
"because
if
they
wasn't
violating
the
law
they
shouldn't
care."
this
is
partin's
view
of
the
protection
of
the
fourth
and
sixth
amendments.
admittedly
however,
there
was
so
explicit
statement
in
the
government's
brief
that
it
is
the
government's
view
too.
now,
petitioner
hoffa
did
not
assume
that
a
private
visitor
to
his
home
would
reveal
a
confidence
as
to
illegal
activity
to
the
government
as
a
good
citizen
what
partin.
i'm
sorry,
what
petitioner
hoffa
assumed
was
that
there
was
no
policeman
in
his
home
unless
he
appeared
at
the
door
with
a
warrant
and
announced
his
police
identity
and
purpose.
this
brings
us
may
it
please
the
court
to
our
argument
on
the
fourth
amendment.
the
admissions
which
partin
claims
to
have
gotten
from
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
are
set
forth
in
detail
at
pages
14
to
18
of
our
main
brief.
so
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned,
the
following
plain
facts
are
important
as
to
these
claim
admissions.
first,
any
single
one
of
them
would
have
been
seriously
prejudicial
to
the
petitioners,
second,
some
of
them
who
have
gotten
by
partin
in
petitioner
hoffa's
suite.
these
were
the
objective
and
direct
result
of
partin's
repeated
entries
into
that
suite
as
a
government
secret
agent
on
october
22nd,
the
opening
day
of
the
test
fleet
trial
and
on
that
day,
two
entries,
on
october
23rd,
october
25th,
october
26th,
october
29th,
november
7th,
november
14th,
two
entries,
november
15th
and
november
20th,
a
total
of
11
distinct
and
separate
entries
into
their
home
suite
in
a
period
of
four
weeks.
third,
on
all
of
these
entries,
partin
as
a
secret
government
agent
was
looking
for
evidence.
fourth,
on
all
of
these
entries,
partin
as
the
government
secret
agent
was
looking
for
evidence
of
nothing
more
definite
that
witness
intimidation,
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activities.
fifth,
for
none
of
these
entries
did
partin
have
a
warrant
of
any
sort.
and
sixth,
throughout
of
course
of
all
of
these
petitioner
hoffa's
home,
petitioner
hoffa
in
that
home
was
preparing
his
defense
of
the
test
fleet
charges
in
conjunction
with
his
counsel
so
that
these
entries
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
we
claimed
were
part
of
a
continuous
process
of
a
pervasive
intrusion
on
the
test
fleet
defense
by
the
government
through
the
sheridan-partin
operation.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
no
he
did
not.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
not
on
this
record.
but
i
would
like
to
comment
on
that
question
if
i
may
mr.
justice
harlan
that
partin
--
i'm
sorry
petitioner
hoffa
was
never
in
a
position
to
object
to
the
entries
of
a
government
agent
because
he
was
never
told
of
that
identity.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
understanding
of
intelligible
facts,
no
intelligible
way
of
conduct.
now
all
of
partin's
entry
in
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
were
unreasonable
and
violated
the
fourth
amendment
because
they
were
entries
made
without
a
warrant
of
any
sort
into
a
man's
home
to
make
general
searches
for
evidences.
as
i
remark
before,
the
government
does
not
really
deny
this
and
i
will
come
in
a
moment
to
what
their
position
is.
indeed,
the
government
as
we
think
it
must
see
the
authority
cited
at
pages
36
and
37
of
our
brief,
explicitly
concedes
that
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
a
government
entry
into
a
home
without
warrant
by
deception
of
the
government's
identity
is
as
much
a
violation
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
of
the
--
i
was
wondering
about
the
slightest
--
the
recess
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
--
is
as
much
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
a
--
as
such
a
government
entry
into
a
home
by
force.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
would
like
to
elucidate
my
answer
further
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
about
whether
the
union
was
paying
for
these
trips
to
nashville
and
apparently
to
state
to
the
record
on
that
mr.
justices
that
partin
does
state
at
one
point
that
the
union
was
paying
his
salary
and
expenses
at
the
time
of
these
trips
to
nashville.
he
also
testifies
at
another
point
that
there
were
many
long
periods
when
the
union
did
not
pay
him
at
all.
now,
the
union
that
you're
speaking
about
mr.
justice
black
is
his
local
union
in
baton
rouge.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
it's
a
local
teamsters
union
however,
so
far
as
the
union
did
pay
him
salary
and
expenses
on
these
11
trips
to
nashville,
this
would
not
be
mr.
hoffa
of
course
personally
paying
it
and
also
mr.
hoffa
as
general
president
of
the
teamster
international
union
would
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
whether
the
local
union
paid
him
or
didn't
pay
him
or
how
much
paid
him
or
anything
else.
mr.
justice
harlan
there's
nothing
like
a
luncheon
recess
and
in
a
little
further
(inaudible)
of
a
question
you
asked
me
as
to
whether
partin
ever
took
anything
out
of
the
suite.
i
had
understood
that
in
the
context
of
whether
any
of
the
evidence
of
partin's
documentary
evidence
rather
than
incriminating
admissions
and
hence
that
your
honor
know.
but
if
one
removes
it
from
that
context,
he
did
take
some
defense
exhibits
on
which
he
had
done
some
minor
clerical
work
and
took
them
to
the
printer
as
part
of
his
activities
in
his
role
of
defense
fact
(inaudible),
also
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
not
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
these
particular
exhibits
were
given
to
the
government.
of
course,
since
the
government
does
--
did
not
introduced
any
documentary
evidence
because
that
would
have
removed
any
legal
question
out
of
this
case
because
of
gouled.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
because
of
gouled
where
there
was
a
fraudulent
entry,
a
deceptive
entry
by
a
government,
a
secret
government
agent
into
this
man's
office
and
documents
were
taken.
only
god
would
know,
i
suppose,
how
many
and
maybe
the
government
how
much
it
might
have
taken
by
way
of
documents.
but
i
think
also
pertinent
to
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
the
fact
that
the
11
entries
that
i
have
enumerated
and
detailed
were
the
11
entries
that
produced
the
incriminating
statements
to
which
he
testified
but
he
was
there
on
33
days,
33
trial
days
of
the
test
fleet
case.
he
was
constantly
hanging
around
in
the
suite
and
he
was
that
time
in
that
suite
when
neither
petitioner
hoffa
nor
petitioner
king
was
there
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
at
time
he
took
any
documents.
now,
to
get
on
with
where
i
was
in
my
argument,
i
had
just
stated
that
the
government
concedes
as
we
believe
it
must
in
accordance
with
the
authority
cited
at
pages
36
and
37
that
an
entry
into
a
man's
home
by
deception
to
look
for
evidence
without
a
warrant
is
as
violative
of
the
constitution
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
such
an
entry
made
by
force.
and
further
the
government
concedes
as
it
must
because
of
wong
sun
against
united
states,
371
u.s.
471
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
not
only
against
documents
and
other
concrete
things
but
against
verbal
statements.
these
government
concessions
made
in
accordance
with
the
authorities,
it
seems
to
us
to
dispose
of
the
fourth
amendment
contention
in
our
favor.
decision
here
in
our
favor
is
controlled
by
gouled
against
the
united
states
in
the
255
volume
of
this
court's
reports
at
page
98
and
go-bart
and
the
decision
of
this
court
go-bart
importing
company
against
the
united
states
in
the
282nd
volume
of
the
official
reports
in
this
court
at
page
344
for
the
only
difference
of
substance
between
gouled
and
go-bart
on
the
one
hand
and
this
case
on
the
other
is
that
in
gouled
and
go-bart,
the
deceptive
entry
obtained
incriminating
documents
and
in
this
case,
the
government's
deceptive
entry
obtained
incriminating
statements
and
so
far
as
that
difference
is
concerned
we
say
that
wong
sun
makes
that
difference
immaterial.
but
the
government
says
and
now
i
come
to
what
it
is
they
are
really
argue
mr.
justice
harlan
but
the
government
says
that
gouled
and
go-bart
importing
company
would
be
controlling
here
if
and
only
if
partin
having
achieved
entry
into
the
government
suite
by
deception
had
heard
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
by
eavesdropping.
now,
it
is
the
fact
in
this
record
may
it
please
the
court
that
several
of
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
were
eavesdropped,
they
were
overheard
by
petition
--
by
partin
from
petitioners
hoffa
and
king.
however,
in
a
further
sniffing
off
of
fourth
amendment
protections
to
tailor
that
fourth
amendment
so
that
this
case
falls
outside
of
it,
the
government
says
further
that
for
fourth
amendment
protection,
not
only
must
partin
have
been
eavesdropping
overhearing
but
in
addition
he
must
have
been
hiding
as
in
a
closet
or
it
may
be
in
a
toilet.
analyze
says
the
government
and
your
honors
got
an
information
of
this
in
mr.
lewin's
argument
in
the
case
preceding
this,
the
statements,
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
could
just
as
well
have
been
made
on
the
street
and
so
they
are
outside
fourth
amendment
protection.
this
is
the
government's
position
and
its
argument
and
to
state
it
is
almost
to
answer
it.
in
its
major
aspects
as
we
all
know,
the
fourth
amendment
is
precisely
directed
to
the
protection
of
the
privacy
of
particular
areas
and
especially
may
it
please
the
court
the
privacy
of
a
man's
home.
as
judge
frank
put
it
in
his
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
on
lee
case
quoted
with
approval
by
this
court
later,
a
man's
home,
"the
inviolate
place
which
is
a
man's
castle."
the
full
quotation
from
mr.
--
from
judge
frank's
description
of
the
privacy
of
a
home
as
a
sizable
hunk
of
liberty
may
it
please
court
worth
protecting
from
encroachment
is
set
forth
at
page
33
in
the
footnote
of
our
brief.
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
in
this
case
your
honors
were
not
made
in
the
street.
they
were
made
in
petitioner
hoffa's
home.
partin,
the
government's
secret
agent
got
into
that
home
by
11
entries
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
--
of
the
fourth
amendment
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
statements
allegedly
obtained
by
partin
cannot
be
separated
from
those
illegal
entries
for
they
were
the
very
objective
of
those
entries
and
their
immediate
product.
no
amount
of
finespun
the
government
theorizing
to
meet
the
facts
of
this
case
can
change
or
eliminate
those
simple
and
immutable
facts.
further
more
may
it
please
the
court,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
partin
entered
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
by
deception
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
somehow
left
that
fourth
amendment
lying
here
by
the
door
when
he
immediately
continued
in
the
same
deception
in
talking
with
petitioners
hoffa
and
king.
and
may
it
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
want
to
be
absolutely
sure
just
what
it
is
you
were
asking.
if
you
are
saying
to
me
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
that
is
with
no
previous
connection.
i
would
put
it
this
way
that
obviously
it
is
not
this
case
and
i
need
not
make
that
comment
that
a
decision
in
our
favor
in
this
case
would
not
control
a
decision
upon
those
facts.
i
think
that
it
would
present
a
much
more
doubtful
question
of
fourth
amendment
violation
but
i
would
say
in
my
view
and
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
without
a
representative
of
the
petitioner
in
such
a
case
that
it
is
indeed
a
violation
of
fourth
amendment
but
that's
just
my
opinion.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
pardon
me.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
not
on
those
precise
facts
mr.
justice
clark.
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
may
it
please
the
court
to
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
householder
against
a
policeman
hiding
in
a
closet
but
not
against
the
policeman
who
is
hiding
under
his
role
of
helping
you
in
your
defense
of
a
criminal
trial.
in
both
cases
above
all
things
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
privacy
of
the
home
be
it
ever
so
humble
or
be
it
a
hotel
suite.
in
both
cases,
no
matter
where
that
policeman
or
how
that
policeman
is
hiding,
the
government
is
secretly
in
the
home
eavesdropping,
listening
in
on
all
conversations.
surely
your
honors
in
the
light
of
centuries
of
american
and
anglo-saxon
history
and
remembering
lord
chatham's
noble
statement
that
the
king's
men
cannot
without
warrant
enter
the
cottage
of
the
poorest
villager
and
considering
for
a
moment
what
it
is
about
the
police
state
that
we
oppose
it
throughout
the
world.
we
cannot
rationally
believe
that
our
forefathers
in
adopting
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
members
of
this
court
in
applying
that
amendment
for
almost
200
years
ever
contemplated
that
the
government
secret
listening
in
on
the
home
conversations
of
a
free
people
would
ever
be
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
reliance
on
an
invalid
eavesdropping
theory,
the
government
sees
no
differences
between
this
case,
the
lopez
case,
the
on
lee
case
and
the
lewis
case
which
follows
our
case
upon
the
argument
calendar.
but
on
lee
unlike
this
case
did
not
involve
an
area
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
lopez
unlike
this
case
did
not
involve
a
government
secret
agent.
in
both
lopez
and
lewis
the
petitioner
invited
the
government
agent
to
his
home
or
office
for
the
very
purpose
of
the
transaction
that
took
place,
the
offer
of
a
bribe
in
lopez
and
the
sale
of
narcotics
in
lewis.
here
petitioner
did
not
invite
partin
to
his
suite
to
bribe
them
as
a
juror
and
influence
him
as
a
juror.
partin
of
course
was
not
a
juror
or
perspective
juror
and
hoffa
in
fact
made
no
such
offer
or
attempt
to
influence
in
relation
to
partin.
petitioner
hoffa
did
not
invite
partin.
partin
invited
himself
by
those
telephone
conversations
on
october
8th
and
18th
recorded
by
the
state
officials
with
reporting
going
to
grimsley
and
sheridan.
partin
invited
himself
and
spied
on
petitioner
hoffa.
so
far
as
petitioner
permitted
partin
in
his
home
suite
in
the
place
where
he
was
preparing
his
defense
the
permission
was
solely
for
the
union
colleague
and
defense
hoffa.
unlike
on
lee,
unlike
lopez,
unlike
lewis
and
unlike
any
other
case
presented
to
this
court
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
all
its
history
this
case
presents
particular
facts
and
circumstances
strongly
called
for
fourth
amendment
protection.
i
enumerate
them.
here,
it
is
not
only
that
the
government
violated
the
privacy
of
a
citizen's
home
but
that
the
government
arranged
for
that
violation
before
there
was
even
a
possibility
that
a
crime
had
been
committed.
here,
it
is
not
only
that
the
government
violated
the
privacy
of
a
citizen's
home
and
arranged
for
that
violation
before
a
crime
could
possibly
ever
been
committed,
but
it
violated
that
home
privacy
not
once,
not
for
just
one
conversation
as
my
colleague
was
arguing
earlier
this
morning
but
many
times
and
over
a
protracted
period.
and
finally
in
this
case,
the
government's
repeated
and
protracted
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
were
directed
against
the
man
on
trial
for
his
liberty
and
preparing
his
defense
in
his
home
so
that
inevitably
these
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
were
part
of
a
government
pervasive
intrusion
on
his
defense
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
brings
us
to
our
sixth
amendment
argument.
our
contention
on
the
sixth
amendment
concerns
the
very
heart
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee,
the
right
of
a
man
on
trial
for
his
life
or
liberty
to
have
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
free
from
any
government
intrusion
upon
that
defense.
the
government
at
least
at
some
points
in
this
brief
agrees
with
that
statement
of
what
the
right
is.
but
the
government
purports
seriously
to
argue
that
partin
did
not
intrude
upon
the
test
fleet
defense.
it
would
be
a
sufficient
answer
may
it
please
the
court
to
note
that
sheridan
admitted
that
some
test
fleet
trial
information,
defense
information
was
passed
on
to
him
and
for
that
to
happen
there
had
to
be
an
intrusion.
in
any
event,
without
repeating
all
the
details
that
i
stated
this
morning
the
intrusion
can
be
summed
up
follows.
partin
carrying
out
his
government
job
of
looking
for
evidence
of
jury
tampering
naturally
sought
that
evidence
in
the
counsels
of
the
test
fleet
defense.
partin's
ostensible
purpose
of
discussing
his
personal
affairs
with
petitioner
hoffa
in
nashville
on
october
22nd
wouldn't
serve
as
a
cover
for
petitioner
hoffa
staying
nashville
for
the
purpose
of
looking
for
evidence
of
illegal
jury
tampering.
some
better
cover
was
needed
so
partin
became
a
defense
helper,
this
would
keep
him
in
and
around
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
counsel
throughout
the
trial.
as
a
defense
helper,
partin
was
in
the
midst
of
defense
preparations,
consultations
and
talks
everywhere
in
petitioner
hoffa's
suite,
defense
headquarters,
at
the
courthouse,
at
meals
and
going
to
and
from
the
courthouses
and
meal
and
partin
state
in
the
midst
of
the
test
fleet's
defense
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial
and
he
did
so
with
the
government's
continuing
approval
for
he
reported
to
sheridan
daily
and
he
did
so
to
the
government's
continuing
profit
for
besides
the
admissions
of
jury
tampering
the
government
obtained
and
used
test
fleet
defense
information.
thus
the
government
in
obvious
disregard
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
perpetrated
not
just
an
intrusion
but
a
pervasive
infiltration
of
that
defense.
with
the
government's
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
apparent,
the
aspect
of
the
sixth
amendment
question
left
is
whether
the
incriminating
statements
were
tainted
by
that
sixth
amendment
violation,
if
so
all
parties
are
aggrieved
that
they
were
in
admissible
in
the
trial
below
and
aggrieved
in
accordance
with
the
authority
stated
in
our
brief.
partin
admits
that
counsel
was
sometimes
close
but
not
in
on
the
conversations
in
which
he
heard
or
overhead
the
incriminating
statements.
the
admission
serves
to
emphasize
the
fact
of
a
single
line
of
action
by
one
man
partin
designed
to
secure
evidence
of
jury
tampering
by
partin's
acting
as
a
defense
assistant.
a
sixth
amendment
violation
deliberately
risked
by
sheridan
as
the
government
admits
in
its
brief.
the
primary
product
of
that
violation
was
the
very
objective
sought
by
that
violation,
partin's
evidence
of
jury
tampering.
the
bonus
was
test
fleet
defense
information,
both
primary
product
and
bonus
were
obtained
by
one
man
in
one
continuous
process
carried
on
in
the
same
places
over
the
same
period
of
time
and
reported
daily
to
sheridan
in
the
same
reports.
to
separate
product
and
bonus
in
these
circumstances
would
be
to
treat
the
sixth
amendment
as
a
thing
of
water,
a
faucet
to
be
turned
on
and
off
as
partin
moved
from
one
part
of
defense
headquarters
to
another.
in
any
event,
as
follows
a
fortiori
from
comparable
cases
decided
by
this
court,
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
at
page
48,
footnote
2,
the
primary
objective
and
the
very
product
of
a
sixth
amendment
violation
of
any
constitutional
violation
cannot
be
separated
from
that
violation
for
in
those
circumstances,
we
have
much
more
than
the
take
which
connects
for
an
indirect
connection
evidence
with
a
constitutional
violation.
i
turn
to
our
argument
on
due
process.
to
the
question
of
whether
petitioners
were
afforded
the
essential
fairness
required
by
the
fifth
amendment.
a
secret
informer
may
it
please
the
court
seems
an
unlovely
thing
to
anyone.
yet
we
recognize
that
there
are
constitutional
uses
of
government
informers.
we
rely
on
much
more
than
the
evil
of
a
secret
government
informer
in
this
proceeding.
the
use
of
a
government
informer,
a
secret
informer
always
risks
perjury
but
that
risk
was
at
its
highest
here
in
view
of
the
charges
pending
against
partin
and
in
view
of
his
natural
desire
to
justify
the
payments
to
his
wife
no
matter
for
what
those
payments
were
made.
as
(inaudible)
teaches,
your
honors
decision
in
that
case,
the
risk
of
perjury
in
a
government
secret
informer's
testimony
may
be
so
great
as
in
and
of
itself
to
invalidate
a
conviction.
but
there
was
more
here
than
the
strong
risk
of
perjury
to
condemn
the
convictions
here.
the
government
unquestionably
ignored
sixth
amendment
rights
in
relation
to
the
test
fleet
defense
unquestionably
in
our
opinion
on
this
record.
but
putting
aside
our
other
legal
protections,
the
government's
conduct
was
at
a
minimum
within
the
penumbra
of
practically
every
fourth
amendment
guarantee
of
sixth
amendment
rights
to
counsel
in
this
proceeding,
of
fifth
amendment
rights
to
self
incrimination
in
this
proceeding.
whatever
the
legal
consequences
of
the
government's
action
separately
considered
under
each
amendment
may
be,
the
government
did
invade
the
privacy
of
the
man's
home.
did
infiltrate
the
counsels
of
this
defense
and
did
deprive
him
of
the
opportunity
to
consult
counsel
and
to
remain
silent.
finally,
as
the
government
does
not
contest
it
had
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
charge
on
--
and
charge
on
jury
tampering
on
october
25th.
on
that
day,
legitimate
law
enforcement
call
for
arrest
and
charge
with
a
fair
trial
to
follow.
by
deferring
arrest
and
charge,
and
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
attended
upon
such
arrest
and
charge
as
recently
explicated
by
this
court
in
this
term,
the
government
effectively
nullified
those
rights
secured
many
more
incriminating
admissions
and
rendered
petitioner's
trial
a
near
formality.
that
is
the
whole
of
the
government's
conduct
which
we
say
is
offensive
to
due
process
case
up
here.
in
conclusion
on
the
whole
case
we
observe
that
the
government
offers
extraneous
reasons
to
explain
its
conduct
in
this
case
but
we
stand
here
on
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
as
the
court
observed
in
united
states
against
(inaudible),
the
constitution
is
designed
to
place
obstacles
in
the
way
of
a
two
permeating
police
surveillance.
partin
surveillance
in
behalf
of
the
government
in
this
case
was
so
permeating
as
to
short
circuit
the
productive
protective
power
of
practically
every
constitutional
safeguard
on
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws.
we
respectfully
submit
that
on
the
well
settled
principles
of
constitutional
law,
the
facts
here
show
that
the
statements
were
inadmissible.
all
petitioners
were
prejudiced
by
those
statements
which
the
jury
was
permitted
to
consider
against
all
of
them
as
one
organic
tissue
of
proof
following
denial
of
their
motions
to
severance.
all
of
their
convictions
should
be
reversed.
whatever
remaining
time
may
the
court
please,
i
reserve
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
thank
you.
as
to
the
question
of
consent
that
he
knew
partin's
identity,
he
admitted
him
to
his
suite,
he
was
at
all
times
free
to
throw
him
out.
this
is
a
cynical
argument
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
he
did
not
know
that
this
was
the
government,
the
police
and
consent
under
those
circumstances
can
only
have
reference
to
waiver,
waiver
of
the
right
to
be
in
his
home
free
of
unreasonable
government
intrusion
and
as
to
that
waiver,
any
such
waiver
he
couldn't
waive
anything
unless
his
rights
were
intelligently
and
understandably
understood
and
waived
and
they
couldn't
have
been
in
this
case
when
he
did
not
know
of
the
critical
fact
that
this
was
a
cop.
now,
and
this
has
been
held
in
conley
v.
cochran
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
cited
at
page
35
and
settled
may
it
please
the
court
since
go-bart
importing
company
when
the
police
came
to
this
house,
came
on
the
porch
and
said
we
have
a
warrant.
they
at
least,
you
knew
they
were
police
and
they
said
they
had
no
--
they
had
a
warrant
which
they
didn't
have
and
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
butler
that
used
to
sit
upon
this
bench
held
that
because
of
that
deception,
because
of
a
general
search
for
evidence,
because
of
the
absence
of
a
warrant
as
is
exactly
true
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
a
couple
of
little
things
in
respect
to
one
question
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
black's
as
to
the
payments
to
partin,
the
memo
from
sheridan
in
the
department
of
justice
to
the
late
mr.
andrada
ordering
these
payments
said
in
connection
with
the
forthcoming
trials
in
nashville,
tennessee
it
is
requested
that
a
check
in
the
amount
of
$300
be
drawn
against
the
confidential
fund
beginning
june
--
july
8
and
this
is
dated
july
3,
1963
and
it
is
also
requested
that
a
check
be
drawn
each
month
from
november
1963
make
payable
to
mr.
grimsley,
not
a
word
about
his
expenses
on
these
trips
nor
any
substantiation
of
them.
now,
as
to
a
question
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
black
or
it
might
have
been
the
chief
justice,
i
forget
in
my
weariness,
whether
partin
invited
himself
to
see
mr.
hoffa
in
nashville
or
whether
mr.
hoffa
invited
partin
there
was
a
somewhat
uncertain
answer
by
government
counsel
but
i
would
refer
the
court
to
pages
1434
and
1438
which
set
forth
those
12
telephone
conversations
and
there
was
absolutely
no
question
that
mr.
partin
invited
himself
to
nashville.
does
this
mean
my
time
is
over?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
if
i
may
i
have
one
more
thing
i
wanted
to
comment
and
it
will
be
my
final
comment.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
government
counsel
made
a
reference
to
as
our
society
--
to
something
about
as
our
society
gets
more
and
more
complicated,
criminal
activities
become
more
and
more
sophisticated
might
have
been
the
word.
i
thought
he
was
talking
about
the
department
of
justice
and
i
mean
that
and
not
jokingly
until
he
referred
to
espionage
and
then
i
know
that
well
that
couldn't
be
the
department.
but
in
this
type
of
issue
on
the
questions
and
constitutional
issues
presented
here,
this
court
has
always
found
that
more
pertinent
to
observe
that
as
its
decisions
have
caught
up
with
this
unconstitutional
police
invasion
of
the
constitution
and
that
one
hardly
anybody
maybe
gets
the
fair
degree
today
the
methods
of
the
police
in
invading
constitutional
requirements
become
more
and
more
sophisticated
and
therefore
as
has
been
said
by
this
court,
this
court
must
be
vigilant
in
liberal
construction
of
these
constitutional
requirements
to
see
that
their
basic
intent
and
purpose
is
observed.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
if
i
may
have
just
a
moment?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
in
behalf
of
all
the
petitioners
in
the
four
individual
appeals
which
are
consolidated
for
argument
today.
they
are
petitioners
hoffa,
king,
campbell
and
parks.
these
four
petitioners
were
convicted
in
one
joint
trial
on
charges
of
jury
tampering.
to
the
affirmance
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
those
convictions,
this
court
granted
certiorari
upon
one
question.
that
question
reads
and
i
quote
whether
evidence
obtained
by
the
government
by
means
of
deceptively
placing
a
secret
informer
in
the
quarters
and
counsels
of
the
defendant
during
one
criminal
trial
so
violates
the
defendant's
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
that
suppression
of
such
evidence
is
required
in
a
subsequent
trial
of
the
same
defendant
on
a
different
charge.
the
phrases
used
in
this
question
upon
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
made
more
intelligible
by
placing
them
in
the
context
of
the
particular
facts
presented
by
these
cases
or
by
this
case,
really.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
the
question
refers
to
two
criminal
trials.
the
first
of
these
was
the
trial
of
petitioner
hoffa
in
nashville
on
a
criminal
charge,
a
misdemeanor
charge
of
violating
the
labor
management
relations
act.
that
trial
started
on
october
22,
1962
and
continued
on
into
december
of
1962.
that
trial
ended
with
a
hung
jury.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes
sir.
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
the
shorthand
reference
throughout
this
argument
i
shall
refer
to
it
as
the
test
fleet
case
or
the
test
fleet
trial
or
the
test
fleet
offense
whichever.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
the
second
trial
of
the
two
trials
referred
to
in
the
question
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
is
of
course
the
trial
in
this
proceeding.
that
trial
began
and
ended
in
1964.
in
that
trial,
the
petitioners
were
convicted
of
tampering
with
the
jury
in
the
test
fleet
case
which
had
occurred
in
nashville
in
1962
from
october
22
then
to
december.
the
question
refers
to
a
deceptively
placed
secret
informer.
that
reference
is
to
one
edward
partin.
that
is
p-a-r-t-i-n.
it
refers
to
evidence
obtained
by
the
government.
this
means
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
incriminating
statements,
admission
statements
allegedly
made
by
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
during
the
course
of
the
test
fleet
trial
in
1962.
these
as
testified
to
by
partin
in
this
proceeding
secured
the
conviction
of
petitioners.
beginning
with
october
22,
1962,
the
opening
date
of
the
test
fleet
trial,
partin
according
to
his
testimony
in
this
proceeding
heard
and
in
summons,
he
said
overheard
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
that
he
claimed
in
this
proceeding.
some
of
them
he
heard
and
some
of
them
he
overheard
in
the
hotel
suite
which
petitioner
hoffa
occupied
in
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
in
nashville
during
the
whole
course
of
the
test
fleet
trial
and
which
served
during
the
course
of
that
trial
both
as
his
home
and
as
the
headquarters
for
his
defense
in
the
test
fleet
case.
finally,
in
providing
context
for
the
question
presented
here,
we
identify
two
government
officials,
department
of
justice
officials.
one
you've
already
heard
a
little
about.
that
is
walter
sheridan,
a
non-lawyer
layman
who
was
assisting
in
the
preparation
and
prosecution
of
the
test
fleet,
the
government's
test
fleet
case
in
nashville
in
1962.
the
other
department
of
justice
official
involved
in
this
case
is
mr.
frank
grimsley,
a
lawyer
in
the
criminal
division
of
the
department
of
justice
generally
stationed
in
atlanta,
georgia
who
was
at
all
of
the
relevant
times
to
this
argument
mr.
sheridan's
subordinate.
the
question
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
presents
five
constitutional
issues.
three
of
those
issues
they
are
points
roman
i,
ii
and
v
of
our
brief,
i
will
cover
in
this
oral
argument
in
the
following
order.
first,
we
urge
that
many
of
the
statements,
incriminating
statements,
allegedly
obtained
by
party
from
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
were
barred
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
the
immediate
product
of
numerous
illegal
entries
made
by
secret
government
agent
partin
into
petitioner
office
home
suite
without
a
warrant
and
when
looking
for
evidence
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activities.
as
we
understand
the
government's
position,
the
government
does
not
deny
the
illegality
of
partin's
repeated
entries
into
petitioner
hoffa's
home
suite
throughout
the
duration
of
the
test
fleet
trial.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
we
say
they
were
illegal
because
as
i
will
develop
in
further
detail
on
this
argument
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
say
that
they
were
illegal
because
he
was
a
government
agent
which
was
being
hidden
at
the
time
of
these
entries
into
a
home
for
the
purpose
of
looking
for
evidence
that
they
were
therefore
illegal
because
if
the
government
agrees
with
us
an
entry
into
a
home
without
a
warrant
by
deception
and
an
entry
into
a
home
without
a
warrant
by
force
are
equivalents
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
view
of
gouled
and
the
(inaudible)
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
if
he
comes
to
the
door
as
the
helper
of
the
household
in
the
preparation
of
his
defense
and
as
his
union
colleague
but
at
the
same
time
is
and
is
hiding
his
identity
as
a
government
secret
agent.
now,
if
your
use
of
the
phrase
mr.
justice
stewart,
a
private
detective
not
connected
with
the
government.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
but
connected
with
the
government,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
yes,
if
he
hit
the
entrance
with
deception
and
concealed
his
identity
as
a
police,
we're
not
--
this
opposition
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
your
honor,
what
they
do
as
we
understand
it,
and
i
will
advert
further
to
this
in
the
course
of
my
argument,
they
at
no
point
deny
the
illegality
of
the
entry.
they
go
further
than
that
and
state
that
in
view
of
the
illegal
entry
had
he
been
hiding
in
a
closet
these
admissions
would
have
been
inadmissible
but
that
the
illegality
of
the
entry
is
immaterial
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
statements
was
directed
to
him
which
i
will
come
into
further
detail
later
mr.
justice
harlan.
as
i
have
already
noted
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
the
government
specifically
concedes
that
force
is
the
equivalent
of
fraud
for
the
purpose
of
fourth
amendment
entries
into
a
home
and
it
concedes
further
that
the
fourth
--
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
extends
to
verbal
statements
although
they
argue
as
i
will
note
later
not
this
type
of
reference.
second,
we
urge
that
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
testified
to
by
partin
were
barred
by
the
sixth
amendment
as
the
very
product
and
the
very
objective
of
partin's
intrusion
as
a
secret
government
agent
into
petitioner
office
defense
of
the
test
fleet
case.
the
government
admits
in
its
brief
and
this
is
not
our
understanding
of
it
but
a
specific
admission
of
the
government
that
sheridan
knowingly
risked
precisely
such
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
in
other
words,
as
we
logically
understand
the
government's
position,
the
question
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
at
least
so
far
as
it
concerns
the
sixth
amendment
is
conceded
in
our
favor
if
that
question
as
stated
accurately
reflects
the
record
and
finally,
in
this
oral
argument
we
will
urge
that
the
testimony
was
barred,
the
incriminated
statements
as
the
product
of
a
--
i've
forgotten
the
phrase
but
mr.
lewin
used
this
morning
as
the
product
of
a
whole
course
of
government
conduct
contrary
to
the
standards
of
fundamental
fairness
required
by
the
due
process
clause.
the
remaining
two
issues,
they
are
points
three
and
four
of
our
brief
are
concerned
with
sixth
amendment
rights
that
counsel
with
respect
to
this
proceeding
rather
than
the
test
fleet
case
and
with
fifth
amendment
rights
against
self-incrimination
with
respect
--
directly
with
respect
to
this
proceeding
rather
than
the
test
fleet
case
and
these
if
your
honors
please,
we
submit
on
our
brief.
the
facts
which
must
guide
and
govern
decision
on
all
the
constitutional
issues
presented
are
the
same.
at
the
outset
of
a
summary
event,
we
should
recall
the
identity
of
the
principle
persons
who
play
a
role
in
those
facts.
petitioner
hoffa
of
course
is
the
defendant
on
trial
in
the
test
fleet
case
beginning
on
october
22,
1962
and
continuing
on
trial
into
the
december
of
that
year.
mr.
sheridan
is
the
department
of
justice
official
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
who
was
in
nashville
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial
assisting
in
the
preparation
and
prosecution
of
a
government's
case.
mr.
grimsley,
his
subordinate,
mr.
grimsley,
a
lawyer,
his
subordinate
generally
stationed
in
atlanta
from
the
criminal
division
of
the
department
of
justice
and
edward
partin
is
no
sort
a
policeman
mr.
chief
justice
either
state
or
federal
at
the
opening
of
these
facts.
he
is
a
local
teamster
union
official
in
baton
rouge
but
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
test
fleet
trial
on
october
22,
he
indubitably
became
as
the
detail
of
facts
i
will
recite
in
a
moment
would
show.
he
indubitably
became
the
government
secret
agent
and
acted
as
such
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial.
the
opening
scene
of
the
facts
is
in
late
september
1962.
it
finds
party
in
a
baton
rouge
jail,
local
state
jail
upon
a
charge
of
kidnapping
with
bail
having
been
denied.
at
the
same
time,
partin
is
facing
a
26
count
federal
indictment
for
embezzlement
and
state
charges
of
man
slaughter
and
forgery.
being
so
situated
in
late
september
of
1962,
partin
tells
the
local
state
officials
a
story
of
a
plot
in
the
preceding
summary
by
petitioner
hoffa
to
assassinate
the
then
attorney
general
robert
kennedy
and
partin
as
to
speak
with
the
federal
officials.
as
a
result,
partin
meets
with
grimsley,
the
department
of
justice
criminal
lawyer,
a
lawyer
in
the
criminal
division
at
two
conferences
in
early
october
held
in
the
officers
of
the
local
state
prosecutor
between
midnight
and
dawn
on
two
mornings.
these
conferences
were
held
at
these
unusual
hours
to
hide
the
fact
that
partin
was
an
agent.
as
we
read
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
was
engaging
in
conferences
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
--
with
grimsley,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
and
this
is
not
my
inference
from
the
record.
this
is
specifically
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
that's
right.
apparently,
they
had
the
more
trusted
jailer
at
sunrise
than
the
man
they
had
at
sunset.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
one
of
these
--
you
mean
by
way
of
time
of
day?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
they
were
between
midnight
and
dawn.
now,
as
we
read
grimsley's
testimony
in
this
proceeding,
partin
became
the
government's
informer
at
one
of
these
early
morning
conferences
on
october
8.
now,
the
government
reads
it
otherwise
but
in
any
event,
we
say
it
is
not
of
any
great
materiality
in
this
case
because
as
we
shall
see
in
a
moment
in
detail,
there
is
absolutely
no
question
on
this
record
that
partin
agreed
with
grimsley
in
atlanta
on
october
20th,
two
days
before
the
test
fleet
case
started
that
he
would
report
evidence
of
illegal
activity,
jury
tampering,
witness
intimidation
or
anything
else
of
interest
to
the
government.
but
to
go
back
to
the
chronology
of
the
facts,
within
a
few
days
of
these
early
morning
conferences,
partin
is
released
from
jail.
by
two
long
distance
calls
to
petitioner
hoffa
on
october
8
and
october
18,
partin
successfully
invites
himself
to
nashville
to
meet
with
petitioner
hoffa
on
october
22,
the
opening
day
of
the
test
fleet
trial.
the
ostensible
purpose
of
that
meeting
as
stated
by
partin
in
these
telephone
conversations
and
they
are
in
the
record
was
to
discuss
his
personal
problems
with
petitioner
hoffa.
as
soon
as
partin
knew
that
he
was
going
to
be
in
nashville
on
october
22nd
to
meet
with
hoffa,
he
immediately
advised
grimsley
and
grimsley
advised
sheridan.
sheridan
instructed
grimsley
to
give
his
nashville
telephone
number
to
partin
and
"to
tell
mr.
partin
that
when
he
got
to
nashville,
if
he
saw
any
evidence
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activities
to
call
me."
the
quote
of
course
is
from
sheridan
himself
from
his
testimony
in
this
proceeding.
so
instructed
by
sheridan,
grimsley
got
partin
to
come
from
baton
rouge
to
atlanta
to
confer
with
grimsley
in
atlanta
in
october
28th
which
as
i
have
already
remark
is
two
days
before
the
opening
of
the
test
fleet
trial.
at
that
conference,
partin
agreed
with
grimsley,
to
keep
his
eyes
and
ears
open
in
nashville
and
report
to
sheridan
on
any
attempts
at
witness
intimidation
or
tampering
with
the
jury.
this
is
a
testimony
of
a
local
state
official
who
was
also
present
at
that
conference.
as
grimsley
himself
sums
it
up,
at
that
conference,
he
gave
partin,
and
i
quote.
"instructions
to
keep
his
eyes
and
ears
open
when
he
was
in
nashville
and
if
he
heard
anything
of
interest
to
call
sheridan."
to
use
partin's
words
on
that
conference
on
october
20th
in
nashville
with
immaterial
omissions,
grimsley
"instructed
me
to
discover
or
to
turn
in
evidence
that
would
substantiate
a
violation
of
the
law
or
jury
tampering
or
something
like
that."
and
partin
to
use
his
own
word
for
it
know
that
in
nashville
he
was
to
observe,
this
is
his
word
for
evidence
of
illegal
activities
and
as
--
again
as
partin
himself
puts
it
when
and
before
he
got
to
nashville
to
the
opening
day
of
the
test
fleet
defense,
"i
knew
what
i
was
looking
for."
when
partin
was
ready
to
leave
baton
rouge
to
go
to
nashville
for
his
meeting
with
petitioner
hoffa
on
october
22nd,
he
called
grimsley
to
advise
him
of
this.
on
his
actual
way
to
nashville
from
baton
rouge
when
changing
planes
at
atlanta,
he
called
grimsley
to
tell
him
that
he
was
on
his
way
and
on
his
arrival
in
nashville,
on
october
22nd,
partin
called
sheridan
to
tell
him,
"i
am
here."
the
government
disputes
this
little
fact,
but
record
references
993
and
781
very
surely
substantiate
it.
now,
the
government
took
many
precautions
to
hide
partin's
identity
as
a
secret
agent.
at
the
very
outset
of
the
test
fleet
trial
on
partin's
arrival
in
nashville,
sheridan
instructed
partin
on
how
to
communicate
with
him
in
order
to
make
his
reports
to
sheridan.
partin
was
assigned
with
a
codename
of
andy
or
anderson
and
sheridan
used
the
codename
john
black.
for
detailed
reports
other
than
reports
by
telephone,
sheridan
was
to
pick
up
and
deliver
partin
on
the
street
away
from
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
where
partin
stated
and
where
petitioner
hoffa
occupied
the
hotel
suite
which
served
both
as
his
home
and
as
his
defense
headquarters
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial.
these
arrangements
made
by
sheridan
with
partin
at
the
outset
of
the
test
fleet
trial
held
throughout
the
trial
as
partin
met
with
sheridan
usually
in
his
automobile,
sometimes
in
sheridan's
nashville
apartment
but
through
the
back
door
and
once
in
a
(inaudible).
according
to
partin's
long
distance
call
arrangements
with
hoffa,
petitioner
hoffa,
he
was
to
be
in
nashville
to
meet
with
the
petitioner
on
one
day
october
22,
to
discuss
his
personal
problems
but
partin
stayed
in
nashville
over
some
eight
weeks
for
most
of
the
trial
days
in
the
test
fleet
case
which
started
as
i
have
stated
october
22nd
and
ended
in
december.
to
do
this,
partin
made
11
round
trip
plane
tickets,
plane
trips
from
baton
rouge
to
nashville.
he's
getting
evidence
and
reporting
it
to
sheridan
was
admittedly
on
this
record
a
factor
in
the
process
by
which
his
trip
to
nashville
for
a
meeting
with
petitioner
hoffa
of
one
day
became
11
trips
to
nashville
in
a
period
of
some
eight
weeks.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
that
comes
to
the
question
your
honor
of
whether
compensation
was
paid
to
partin
by
the
government
which
i
will
reach
in
detail
in
a
moment.
there
are
some
disputes
between
it.
i
should
say
in
candor
at
the
same
time
mr.
justice
harlan
that
it
does
appear
in
the
record.
i
don't
know
what
the
trip's
cost
but
it
does
appear
in
the
record
that
he
was
drawing
union
salary
during
this
time
as
a
local
union
official,
teamster
union
official
in
baton
rouge.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
in
baton
rouge,
lousiana,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
let
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
there's
subquestion
about
it
on
this
record
and
i
will
go
into
it
in
detail
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
now,
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
test
fleet
defense
counsel
live
in
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial.
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
served
as
i
have
stated
both
as
his
home
and
as
the
home
in
which
in
conjunction
with
this
counsel
he
was
preparing
and
carrying
on
his
defense
in
the
test
fleet
criminal
prosecution.
in
petitioner
hoffa's
suite,
his
counsel
conferred
with
him
as
to
his
defense,
they
interviewed
prospective
witnesses.
they
prepared
for
the
examination
and
cross
examination
of
witnesses.
they
discussed
questions
of
law,
and
at
the
end
of
each
day
a
process
with
which
all
of
us
lawyers
if
i
may
so
mr.
chief
justice
are
familiar.
they
consider
into
the
night
what
would
be
the
trial
strategy
for
the
next
day.
with
one
minor
exception
when
partin
was
unable
to
get
a
room
on
one
of
his
11
round
trips
to
nashville
when
he
was
unable
to
get
a
room
at
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
with
that
one
exception,
partin
also
stayed
at
the
andrew
jackson
hotel
throughout
the
trial
days
of
the
test
fleet
trial.
on
his
first
day
in
nashville,
partin
went
to
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
and
thereafter
he
was
constantly
hanging
around
that
suite.
in
the
suite,
he
got
people
ashtrays,
he
moved
chairs
in
the
suite
for
the
participants
discussing
their
defense
and
he
acted
as
doorman
to
the
suite,
sitting
on
occasion,
outside,
just
outside
the
suite
and
on
occasion
just
inside
the
suite.
he
even
went
so
far
has
to
deliver
the
morning
newspapers,
the
early
morning
newspapers.
according
to
partin
himself,
when
he
was
acting
as
doorman,
petitioner
hoffa
"would
tell
me
a
lot
of
things
that
didn't
pertain
to
the
jury."
with
defense
counsel
in
court
everyday
in
the
course
of
the
test
fleet
defense,
partin
was
there
everyday
too.
he
ate
with
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
counsel
and
went
to
--
back
and
forth
from
meals
in
the
courthouse
with
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
counsel.
in
some
as
the
detailed
facts
show
and
there's
six
counsel
who
participated
in
the
test
fleet
defense
testified
and
we
say
without
contradiction
in
this
record
the
government
says
there
was
a
contradiction
but
at
partin's
testimony
as
examined
he
never
squarely
denies
any
of
this.
he
doesn't
remember.
he
wasn't
interested.
he
has
no
recollection.
as
these
six
attorneys
testified,
partin
had
an
access
to
the
defense
counsel
and
partin
participated
in
and
associated
with
defense
counsel
when
defense
matters
and
defense
strategy
were
under
discussion.
the
record
is
replete
with
examples.
partin
was
present
when
defense
counsel
interviewed
a
number
of
prospective
witnesses
in
the
test
fleet
case.
he
helped
assemble
typewritten
statements
of
their
testimony,
of
their
expected
testimony
as
sheridan
explicitly
admitted
he
told
sheridan
about
it
and
as
the
record
sufficiently
indicates
sheridan
told
the
government
prosecutor,
the
man
actually
on
the
floor
handling
the
government's
case
in
the
test
fleet.
partin
discussed
the
selection
of
the
jury
with
petitioner
hoffa
and
heard
counsel,
discussed
it
and
in
this
connection
reported
to
sheridan
that
the
defense
was
investigating
the
prospective
(inaudible)
on
the
jury.
he
heard
one
of
defense
counsel
criticizing
other
defense
counsel
as
to
what
they
were
doing
wrong
in
the
case
and
what
should
be
done
in
correction.
he
was
present
when
the
questions
for
jury
voir
dire
were
distributed
amongst
counsel
and
on
three
separate
occasions
may
it
please
the
court,
he
interrogated
defense
counsel
on
what
--
on
various
aspects
of
trial
strategy
in
the
test
fleet
defense.
partin
himself
volunteers
that
he,"infiltrated"
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
counsel.
as
a
result
of
the
partin
infiltration
of
the
test
fleet
defense,
partin
without
question
got
some
defense
information
which
he
passed
on
to
sheridan
in
the
course
of
his
daily
reports
to
sheridan.
now,
at
this
point
i
might
take
a
moment
to
state,
may
it
please
the
court
that
there
is
some
difference
between
the
government
and
us
as
to
how
much
defense
information
he
passed
on
to
sheridan.
although
the
government
argues
at
first
for
getting
when
they
do
get
on
the
subject,
they
have
to
admit
that
there
was
some
defense
information
passed
on
to
sheridan.
with
all
of
these
going
on,
may
it
please
the
court,
test
fleet
defense
counsel
i
mean
with
all
of
these
going
on,
partin
and
the
petitioner
hoffa's
headquarters
telling
sheridan
what's
taking
place
there
at
the
defense
counsel,
the
defense
counsel's
consultations.
with
all
of
these
going
on
may
it
please
the
court,
test
fleet
defense
counsel
suspected
some
sort
of
government
surveillance
of
the
test
fleet
defense
whether
by
wire
tapping
or
otherwise.
and
as
early
as
november
1,
1962,
just
nine
days
after
this
trial
had
begun
they
complained
to
the
trial
judge
in
test
fleet.
the
government
flatly
denied
surveillance
of
any
shape,
type
or
form.
the
judge
admonished
the
government,
this
is
at
the
test
fleet
trial
court
judge
and
i
quote
his
admonition,
"certainly,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
privacy
in
dealing
with
his
own
counsel
and
in
communicating
with
his
own
counsel."
that
right
will
be
respected.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
government
did
not
come
forward
at
that
time
to
say
to
the
trial
court
judge
as
they
now
in
substance
say
in
their
brief,
your
honor,
we
have
government
secret
agent
partin
in
and
around
the
test
fleet
defense
and
we
know
that
that
risked
a
sixth
amendment
violation
of
his
right
to
the
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel
but
your
honor
we
are
going
to
leave
him
there
nevertheless
because
we
think
this
is
the
way
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
jury.
while
in
nashville,
partin
reported
to
sheridan
on
a
daily
basis
and
from
time
to
time,
he
also
reported
to
grimsley
by
telephone.
neither
sheridan
nor
grimsley
ever
gave
partin
any
definition
or
detail
on
what
is
jury
tampering
or
witness
intimidation
or
other
illegal
activity
or
anything
of
interest,
the
evidence
he
was
to
look
for
in
nashville
and
neither
sheridan
nor
grimsley
ever
told
partin
to
keep
away
from
the
test
fleet
defense
counsels
and
stop
reporting
test
fleet
defense
information
to
sheridan.
so
to
use
of
partin's
own
words,
he
reported
"anything
that
i
would
have
seen."
hence,
partin's
reports
to
sheridan
on
the
results
of
his
activities
in
the
midst
of
the
test
fleet
defense
covered
two
types
of
information.
one,
test
fleet
defense
information,
and
two
the
admissions
of
jury
tampering
which
he
claims
to
have
heard
or
overheard
from
petitioners
hoffa
and
king.
now,
while
partin
was
carrying
on
this
job,
this
course
of
conduct
as
the
government
secret
agent
in
nashville
from
the
very
opening
day
of
the
test
fleet
trial
to
its
very
end,
he
was
at
the
same
time
as
the
government's
secret
informer
and
agent
reporting
to
the
government
on
a
matter
or
a
bribe
of
a
completely
unrelated
government
official
and
an
official
of
national
labors
relations
board.
and
after
the
test
fleet
trial
was
over
and
when
the
grand
jury
inquiry
in
respect
to
this
proceeding
was
in
progress,
partin
as
he
testified
in
the
trial
below
reported
to
sheridan
that
one
of
petitioner
hoffa
counsel
was
advising
all
prospective
grand
jury
witnesses
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment
and
giving
them
a
form
for
the
purpose.
it
is
a
fair
indeed
in
our
view
inescapable
inference
from
this
record
that
partin
in
carrying
on
his
work
as
the
government's
secret
agent
did
exactly
what
the
government
told
them
to
do
no
more
and
no
less.
at
page
701
of
the
record,
partin
says
that
he
did
not
keep
notes
of
the
time,
dates
and
places
of
the
alleged
incriminating
admissions
to
which
he
testified
because
sheridan
did
not
tell
him
to.
at
page
778
of
the
record,
partin
says
that
he
can
precisely
remember
the
claimed
incriminating
admissions
and
not
remember
any
help
discussions
amongst
counsel
of
jury
selection
because
it
was
jury
tampering
that
sheridan
told
him
to
remember.
and
at
page
1011
of
the
record,
partin
revealingly
says
in
connection
with
his
relationship
to
grimsley
and
to
sheridan,
"i
figured
that
they
knew
well
enough
what
they
were
doing
if
it
was
suggested
or
even
hit
it
i
would
have
done
what
they
said
do,
now
i
would
have
some
syntactical
difficulty,"
but
the
"they"
there
in
its
context
is
sheridan
and
grimsley.
i
come
to
the
matter
that
bears
upon
the
question
you
asked
a
few
minutes
ago
mr.
chief
justice
the
matter
of
compensation
to
partin
for
his
work
as
a
government
agent.
it
is
the
fact
in
this
proceeding
that
today
in
the
fall
of
1966,
partin
has
never
been
tried
on
any
of
the
criminal
charges
he
faced
in
late
september
1962.
now,
the
problem
that
offers
a
number
of
explanations
for
each
of
these
and
why
it
wasn't
tried
in
our
view,
we
think
it
may
well
be
a
case
that
the
lady
does
protest
too
much.
it
is
the
further
fact
that
the
department
of
justice
paid
partin's
wife
a
monthly
sum
of
$300.00
for
a
total
of
$1200
in
the
period
after
the
test
fleet
defense,
after
the
close
of
the
test
fleet
trial
and
before
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding.
these
sums
were
in
exactly
the
same
monthly
amounts
as
partin
was
required
by
court
order
to
pay
to
his
wife
for
the
support
of
his
children.
by
written
order
of
mr.
sheridan
in
the
department
of
justice
the
sums
involved
were
paid
out
of
a
confidential
fund
by
check
to
mr.
grimsley,
mr.
grimsley
then
cashed
those
checks
bought
cashier's
checks
and
sent
them
to
mrs.
grimsley
without
showing
in
any
way
the
identity
of
its
sender.
did
i
--
to
mrs.
partin,
sent
them
to
mrs.
partin.
did
i
say
mrs.
grimsley?
it
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue.
grimsley
sent
these
cashier's
checks
to
mrs.
partin.
now,
the
government
says
and
let
me
interpolate
there
is
no
question
about
the
facts
i
have
just
stated
upon
this
record.
but
the
government
says
that
these
payments
in
behalf
partin
to
his
wife
were
made
for
expenses
that
he
incurred
not
in
connection
with
the
plane
trips
that
you
were
inquiring
about
mr.
chief
justice
but
in
connection
with
other
trips
that
he
made
to
various
cities
in
the
country
to
consult
with
department
of
justice
counsel
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
his
testimony
in
this
proceeding.
but
partin
never
submitted
a
statement,
voucher
or
bill
for
any
of
these
claimed
trips
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
connection
with
the
subject
that
i
touched
upon
a
moment
ago
that
the
reason
he
did
not
do
so
is
that
sheridan
didn't
tell
him
to
do
this.
and
secondly,
grimsley
although
he
tried
and
he
made
an
affidavit
i
think
it
appears
in
this
record
sufficiently
indicated
its
original
form
in
the
record,
he
had
about
a
half
sheet
of
paper
and
he
tried
to
relate
these
monthly
payments
to
what
the
trips
might
have
cost.
he
finally
admitted
that
he
was
unable
to
do
this
and
that
the
sums
paid
to
mrs.
partin
was
set
in
exact
accordance
with
the
amounts
that
partin
owed
her
for
the
support
of
his
children
on
the
court
order.
and
finally
in
this
connection,
on
the
matter
of
compensation
of
partin,
grimsley
unguardedly
states
in
another
connection
that
some
of
these
trips
claimed
by
the
government
as
the
basis
of
the
payments
to
partin
to
consult
with
counsel
in
preparation
of
his
testimony
in
this
proceeding
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
just
what
i
said
a
few
minutes
ago
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
as
i
recall
a
record
in
this
case,
it
is
the
fact
that
he
was
withdrawing
salary
from
here.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
evidence
that
they
were
paying
his
expenses?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
precise
point
of
whether
he
was
paid
by
the
union
for
these
trips.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
as
i
recall
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
don't
think
so.
he
was
drawing
his
regular
salary.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
that
is
--
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
mr.
justice.
he
was
drawing
whatever
he
usually
drew
from
the
union.
we
would
say
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
i
have
just
summarized,
on
the
facts
as
to
compensation
that
rather
clearly
partin
was
paid
by
the
government
both
by
way
of
these
checks
to
his
wife
and
by
way
of
--
to
put
it
at
its
mildest,
easy
treatment
on
the
criminal
charges
that
were
pending
against
him,
but
our
basic
contention
is
that
this
question
isn't
very
material
to
this
case
because
the
fact
remains
whether
he
was
paid
or
not
that
partin
was
the
government
secret
agent
before
he
got
to
nashville
and
remained
the
government's
hard
working
and
complaisant
secret
agent
throughout
the
test
fleet
defense.
i
have
taken
considerable
time,
may
it
please
the
court
to
state
these
facts
at
length
in
detail
and
in
their
full
color
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
have
done
so
is
that
the
writers
of
the
government's
brief
in
relation
to
the
facts
of
this
case
tend
to
close
their
eyes,
shut
their
ears,
do
something
like
this
and
argue
this
case
as
if
partin
with
no
prior
connection
with
the
government
as
a
private
visitor
in
petitioner
hoffa's
home
is
entrusted
with
confidences
as
to
jury
tampering
and
as
a
good
citizen
reports
them
to
the
government
but
that
is
not
this
case.
here,
no
matter
how
minor
conflicts
in
the
evidence
may
be
resolved
or
not
resolved
at
all,
the
basic
set
of
facts
are
clear,
partin
contracted
with
grimsley
in
atlanta
on
october
20th
before
the
opening
of
the
test
fleet
trial
to
look
for
jury
tampering
in
nashville.
he
repeatedly
looked
for
evidence
of
jury
tampering
in
nashville.
he
repeatedly
looked
for
such
evidence
in
petitioner
hoffa's
home
and
in
the
same
place
petitioner
hoffa's
defense
headquarters
and
according
to
his
own
testimony
he
there
heard
or
overheard
much
of
what
he
was
looking.
now,
partin
did
not
tell
petitioners
hoffa
or
king
that
he
was
acting
for
the
government
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial.
as
partin
puts
it,
he
did
not
so
tell
them,
"because
if
they
wasn't
violating
the
law
they
shouldn't
care."
this
is
partin's
view
of
the
protection
of
the
fourth
and
sixth
amendments.
admittedly
however,
there
was
so
explicit
statement
in
the
government's
brief
that
it
is
the
government's
view
too.
now,
petitioner
hoffa
did
not
assume
that
a
private
visitor
to
his
home
would
reveal
a
confidence
as
to
illegal
activity
to
the
government
as
a
good
citizen
what
partin.
i'm
sorry,
what
petitioner
hoffa
assumed
was
that
there
was
no
policeman
in
his
home
unless
he
appeared
at
the
door
with
a
warrant
and
announced
his
police
identity
and
purpose.
this
brings
us
may
it
please
the
court
to
our
argument
on
the
fourth
amendment.
the
admissions
which
partin
claims
to
have
gotten
from
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
are
set
forth
in
detail
at
pages
14
to
18
of
our
main
brief.
so
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned,
the
following
plain
facts
are
important
as
to
these
claim
admissions.
first,
any
single
one
of
them
would
have
been
seriously
prejudicial
to
the
petitioners,
second,
some
of
them
who
have
gotten
by
partin
in
petitioner
hoffa's
suite.
these
were
the
objective
and
direct
result
of
partin's
repeated
entries
into
that
suite
as
a
government
secret
agent
on
october
22nd,
the
opening
day
of
the
test
fleet
trial
and
on
that
day,
two
entries,
on
october
23rd,
october
25th,
october
26th,
october
29th,
november
7th,
november
14th,
two
entries,
november
15th
and
november
20th,
a
total
of
11
distinct
and
separate
entries
into
their
home
suite
in
a
period
of
four
weeks.
third,
on
all
of
these
entries,
partin
as
a
secret
government
agent
was
looking
for
evidence.
fourth,
on
all
of
these
entries,
partin
as
the
government
secret
agent
was
looking
for
evidence
of
nothing
more
definite
that
witness
intimidation,
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activities.
fifth,
for
none
of
these
entries
did
partin
have
a
warrant
of
any
sort.
and
sixth,
throughout
of
course
of
all
of
these
petitioner
hoffa's
home,
petitioner
hoffa
in
that
home
was
preparing
his
defense
of
the
test
fleet
charges
in
conjunction
with
his
counsel
so
that
these
entries
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
we
claimed
were
part
of
a
continuous
process
of
a
pervasive
intrusion
on
the
test
fleet
defense
by
the
government
through
the
sheridan-partin
operation.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
no
he
did
not.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
not
on
this
record.
but
i
would
like
to
comment
on
that
question
if
i
may
mr.
justice
harlan
that
partin
--
i'm
sorry
petitioner
hoffa
was
never
in
a
position
to
object
to
the
entries
of
a
government
agent
because
he
was
never
told
of
that
identity.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
understanding
of
intelligible
facts,
no
intelligible
way
of
conduct.
now
all
of
partin's
entry
in
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
were
unreasonable
and
violated
the
fourth
amendment
because
they
were
entries
made
without
a
warrant
of
any
sort
into
a
man's
home
to
make
general
searches
for
evidences.
as
i
remark
before,
the
government
does
not
really
deny
this
and
i
will
come
in
a
moment
to
what
their
position
is.
indeed,
the
government
as
we
think
it
must
see
the
authority
cited
at
pages
36
and
37
of
our
brief,
explicitly
concedes
that
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
a
government
entry
into
a
home
without
warrant
by
deception
of
the
government's
identity
is
as
much
a
violation
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
of
the
--
i
was
wondering
about
the
slightest
--
the
recess
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
--
is
as
much
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
a
--
as
such
a
government
entry
into
a
home
by
force.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i
would
like
to
elucidate
my
answer
further
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
about
whether
the
union
was
paying
for
these
trips
to
nashville
and
apparently
to
state
to
the
record
on
that
mr.
justices
that
partin
does
state
at
one
point
that
the
union
was
paying
his
salary
and
expenses
at
the
time
of
these
trips
to
nashville.
he
also
testifies
at
another
point
that
there
were
many
long
periods
when
the
union
did
not
pay
him
at
all.
now,
the
union
that
you're
speaking
about
mr.
justice
black
is
his
local
union
in
baton
rouge.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
it's
a
local
teamsters
union
however,
so
far
as
the
union
did
pay
him
salary
and
expenses
on
these
11
trips
to
nashville,
this
would
not
be
mr.
hoffa
of
course
personally
paying
it
and
also
mr.
hoffa
as
general
president
of
the
teamster
international
union
would
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
whether
the
local
union
paid
him
or
didn't
pay
him
or
how
much
paid
him
or
anything
else.
mr.
justice
harlan
there's
nothing
like
a
luncheon
recess
and
in
a
little
further
(inaudible)
of
a
question
you
asked
me
as
to
whether
partin
ever
took
anything
out
of
the
suite.
i
had
understood
that
in
the
context
of
whether
any
of
the
evidence
of
partin's
documentary
evidence
rather
than
incriminating
admissions
and
hence
that
your
honor
know.
but
if
one
removes
it
from
that
context,
he
did
take
some
defense
exhibits
on
which
he
had
done
some
minor
clerical
work
and
took
them
to
the
printer
as
part
of
his
activities
in
his
role
of
defense
fact
(inaudible),
also
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
not
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
these
particular
exhibits
were
given
to
the
government.
of
course,
since
the
government
does
--
did
not
introduced
any
documentary
evidence
because
that
would
have
removed
any
legal
question
out
of
this
case
because
of
gouled.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
because
of
gouled
where
there
was
a
fraudulent
entry,
a
deceptive
entry
by
a
government,
a
secret
government
agent
into
this
man's
office
and
documents
were
taken.
only
god
would
know,
i
suppose,
how
many
and
maybe
the
government
how
much
it
might
have
taken
by
way
of
documents.
but
i
think
also
pertinent
to
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
the
fact
that
the
11
entries
that
i
have
enumerated
and
detailed
were
the
11
entries
that
produced
the
incriminating
statements
to
which
he
testified
but
he
was
there
on
33
days,
33
trial
days
of
the
test
fleet
case.
he
was
constantly
hanging
around
in
the
suite
and
he
was
that
time
in
that
suite
when
neither
petitioner
hoffa
nor
petitioner
king
was
there
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
at
time
he
took
any
documents.
now,
to
get
on
with
where
i
was
in
my
argument,
i
had
just
stated
that
the
government
concedes
as
we
believe
it
must
in
accordance
with
the
authority
cited
at
pages
36
and
37
that
an
entry
into
a
man's
home
by
deception
to
look
for
evidence
without
a
warrant
is
as
violative
of
the
constitution
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
such
an
entry
made
by
force.
and
further
the
government
concedes
as
it
must
because
of
wong
sun
against
united
states,
371
u.s.
471
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
not
only
against
documents
and
other
concrete
things
but
against
verbal
statements.
these
government
concessions
made
in
accordance
with
the
authorities,
it
seems
to
us
to
dispose
of
the
fourth
amendment
contention
in
our
favor.
decision
here
in
our
favor
is
controlled
by
gouled
against
the
united
states
in
the
255
volume
of
this
court's
reports
at
page
98
and
go-bart
and
the
decision
of
this
court
go-bart
importing
company
against
the
united
states
in
the
282nd
volume
of
the
official
reports
in
this
court
at
page
344
for
the
only
difference
of
substance
between
gouled
and
go-bart
on
the
one
hand
and
this
case
on
the
other
is
that
in
gouled
and
go-bart,
the
deceptive
entry
obtained
incriminating
documents
and
in
this
case,
the
government's
deceptive
entry
obtained
incriminating
statements
and
so
far
as
that
difference
is
concerned
we
say
that
wong
sun
makes
that
difference
immaterial.
but
the
government
says
and
now
i
come
to
what
it
is
they
are
really
argue
mr.
justice
harlan
but
the
government
says
that
gouled
and
go-bart
importing
company
would
be
controlling
here
if
and
only
if
partin
having
achieved
entry
into
the
government
suite
by
deception
had
heard
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
by
eavesdropping.
now,
it
is
the
fact
in
this
record
may
it
please
the
court
that
several
of
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
were
eavesdropped,
they
were
overheard
by
petition
--
by
partin
from
petitioners
hoffa
and
king.
however,
in
a
further
sniffing
off
of
fourth
amendment
protections
to
tailor
that
fourth
amendment
so
that
this
case
falls
outside
of
it,
the
government
says
further
that
for
fourth
amendment
protection,
not
only
must
partin
have
been
eavesdropping
overhearing
but
in
addition
he
must
have
been
hiding
as
in
a
closet
or
it
may
be
in
a
toilet.
analyze
says
the
government
and
your
honors
got
an
information
of
this
in
mr.
lewin's
argument
in
the
case
preceding
this,
the
statements,
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
could
just
as
well
have
been
made
on
the
street
and
so
they
are
outside
fourth
amendment
protection.
this
is
the
government's
position
and
its
argument
and
to
state
it
is
almost
to
answer
it.
in
its
major
aspects
as
we
all
know,
the
fourth
amendment
is
precisely
directed
to
the
protection
of
the
privacy
of
particular
areas
and
especially
may
it
please
the
court
the
privacy
of
a
man's
home.
as
judge
frank
put
it
in
his
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
on
lee
case
quoted
with
approval
by
this
court
later,
a
man's
home,
"the
inviolate
place
which
is
a
man's
castle."
the
full
quotation
from
mr.
--
from
judge
frank's
description
of
the
privacy
of
a
home
as
a
sizable
hunk
of
liberty
may
it
please
court
worth
protecting
from
encroachment
is
set
forth
at
page
33
in
the
footnote
of
our
brief.
the
alleged
incriminating
statements
in
this
case
your
honors
were
not
made
in
the
street.
they
were
made
in
petitioner
hoffa's
home.
partin,
the
government's
secret
agent
got
into
that
home
by
11
entries
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
--
of
the
fourth
amendment
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
statements
allegedly
obtained
by
partin
cannot
be
separated
from
those
illegal
entries
for
they
were
the
very
objective
of
those
entries
and
their
immediate
product.
no
amount
of
finespun
the
government
theorizing
to
meet
the
facts
of
this
case
can
change
or
eliminate
those
simple
and
immutable
facts.
further
more
may
it
please
the
court,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
partin
entered
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
by
deception
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
somehow
left
that
fourth
amendment
lying
here
by
the
door
when
he
immediately
continued
in
the
same
deception
in
talking
with
petitioners
hoffa
and
king.
and
may
it
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
want
to
be
absolutely
sure
just
what
it
is
you
were
asking.
if
you
are
saying
to
me
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
that
is
with
no
previous
connection.
i
would
put
it
this
way
that
obviously
it
is
not
this
case
and
i
need
not
make
that
comment
that
a
decision
in
our
favor
in
this
case
would
not
control
a
decision
upon
those
facts.
i
think
that
it
would
present
a
much
more
doubtful
question
of
fourth
amendment
violation
but
i
would
say
in
my
view
and
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
without
a
representative
of
the
petitioner
in
such
a
case
that
it
is
indeed
a
violation
of
fourth
amendment
but
that's
just
my
opinion.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
pardon
me.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
not
on
those
precise
facts
mr.
justice
clark.
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
may
it
please
the
court
to
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
householder
against
a
policeman
hiding
in
a
closet
but
not
against
the
policeman
who
is
hiding
under
his
role
of
helping
you
in
your
defense
of
a
criminal
trial.
in
both
cases
above
all
things
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
privacy
of
the
home
be
it
ever
so
humble
or
be
it
a
hotel
suite.
in
both
cases,
no
matter
where
that
policeman
or
how
that
policeman
is
hiding,
the
government
is
secretly
in
the
home
eavesdropping,
listening
in
on
all
conversations.
surely
your
honors
in
the
light
of
centuries
of
american
and
anglo-saxon
history
and
remembering
lord
chatham's
noble
statement
that
the
king's
men
cannot
without
warrant
enter
the
cottage
of
the
poorest
villager
and
considering
for
a
moment
what
it
is
about
the
police
state
that
we
oppose
it
throughout
the
world.
we
cannot
rationally
believe
that
our
forefathers
in
adopting
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
members
of
this
court
in
applying
that
amendment
for
almost
200
years
ever
contemplated
that
the
government
secret
listening
in
on
the
home
conversations
of
a
free
people
would
ever
be
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
reliance
on
an
invalid
eavesdropping
theory,
the
government
sees
no
differences
between
this
case,
the
lopez
case,
the
on
lee
case
and
the
lewis
case
which
follows
our
case
upon
the
argument
calendar.
but
on
lee
unlike
this
case
did
not
involve
an
area
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
lopez
unlike
this
case
did
not
involve
a
government
secret
agent.
in
both
lopez
and
lewis
the
petitioner
invited
the
government
agent
to
his
home
or
office
for
the
very
purpose
of
the
transaction
that
took
place,
the
offer
of
a
bribe
in
lopez
and
the
sale
of
narcotics
in
lewis.
here
petitioner
did
not
invite
partin
to
his
suite
to
bribe
them
as
a
juror
and
influence
him
as
a
juror.
partin
of
course
was
not
a
juror
or
perspective
juror
and
hoffa
in
fact
made
no
such
offer
or
attempt
to
influence
in
relation
to
partin.
petitioner
hoffa
did
not
invite
partin.
partin
invited
himself
by
those
telephone
conversations
on
october
8th
and
18th
recorded
by
the
state
officials
with
reporting
going
to
grimsley
and
sheridan.
partin
invited
himself
and
spied
on
petitioner
hoffa.
so
far
as
petitioner
permitted
partin
in
his
home
suite
in
the
place
where
he
was
preparing
his
defense
the
permission
was
solely
for
the
union
colleague
and
defense
hoffa.
unlike
on
lee,
unlike
lopez,
unlike
lewis
and
unlike
any
other
case
presented
to
this
court
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
all
its
history
this
case
presents
particular
facts
and
circumstances
strongly
called
for
fourth
amendment
protection.
i
enumerate
them.
here,
it
is
not
only
that
the
government
violated
the
privacy
of
a
citizen's
home
but
that
the
government
arranged
for
that
violation
before
there
was
even
a
possibility
that
a
crime
had
been
committed.
here,
it
is
not
only
that
the
government
violated
the
privacy
of
a
citizen's
home
and
arranged
for
that
violation
before
a
crime
could
possibly
ever
been
committed,
but
it
violated
that
home
privacy
not
once,
not
for
just
one
conversation
as
my
colleague
was
arguing
earlier
this
morning
but
many
times
and
over
a
protracted
period.
and
finally
in
this
case,
the
government's
repeated
and
protracted
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
were
directed
against
the
man
on
trial
for
his
liberty
and
preparing
his
defense
in
his
home
so
that
inevitably
these
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
were
part
of
a
government
pervasive
intrusion
on
his
defense
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
brings
us
to
our
sixth
amendment
argument.
our
contention
on
the
sixth
amendment
concerns
the
very
heart
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee,
the
right
of
a
man
on
trial
for
his
life
or
liberty
to
have
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
free
from
any
government
intrusion
upon
that
defense.
the
government
at
least
at
some
points
in
this
brief
agrees
with
that
statement
of
what
the
right
is.
but
the
government
purports
seriously
to
argue
that
partin
did
not
intrude
upon
the
test
fleet
defense.
it
would
be
a
sufficient
answer
may
it
please
the
court
to
note
that
sheridan
admitted
that
some
test
fleet
trial
information,
defense
information
was
passed
on
to
him
and
for
that
to
happen
there
had
to
be
an
intrusion.
in
any
event,
without
repeating
all
the
details
that
i
stated
this
morning
the
intrusion
can
be
summed
up
follows.
partin
carrying
out
his
government
job
of
looking
for
evidence
of
jury
tampering
naturally
sought
that
evidence
in
the
counsels
of
the
test
fleet
defense.
partin's
ostensible
purpose
of
discussing
his
personal
affairs
with
petitioner
hoffa
in
nashville
on
october
22nd
wouldn't
serve
as
a
cover
for
petitioner
hoffa
staying
nashville
for
the
purpose
of
looking
for
evidence
of
illegal
jury
tampering.
some
better
cover
was
needed
so
partin
became
a
defense
helper,
this
would
keep
him
in
and
around
petitioner
hoffa
and
his
counsel
throughout
the
trial.
as
a
defense
helper,
partin
was
in
the
midst
of
defense
preparations,
consultations
and
talks
everywhere
in
petitioner
hoffa's
suite,
defense
headquarters,
at
the
courthouse,
at
meals
and
going
to
and
from
the
courthouses
and
meal
and
partin
state
in
the
midst
of
the
test
fleet's
defense
throughout
the
test
fleet
trial
and
he
did
so
with
the
government's
continuing
approval
for
he
reported
to
sheridan
daily
and
he
did
so
to
the
government's
continuing
profit
for
besides
the
admissions
of
jury
tampering
the
government
obtained
and
used
test
fleet
defense
information.
thus
the
government
in
obvious
disregard
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
perpetrated
not
just
an
intrusion
but
a
pervasive
infiltration
of
that
defense.
with
the
government's
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
apparent,
the
aspect
of
the
sixth
amendment
question
left
is
whether
the
incriminating
statements
were
tainted
by
that
sixth
amendment
violation,
if
so
all
parties
are
aggrieved
that
they
were
in
admissible
in
the
trial
below
and
aggrieved
in
accordance
with
the
authority
stated
in
our
brief.
partin
admits
that
counsel
was
sometimes
close
but
not
in
on
the
conversations
in
which
he
heard
or
overhead
the
incriminating
statements.
the
admission
serves
to
emphasize
the
fact
of
a
single
line
of
action
by
one
man
partin
designed
to
secure
evidence
of
jury
tampering
by
partin's
acting
as
a
defense
assistant.
a
sixth
amendment
violation
deliberately
risked
by
sheridan
as
the
government
admits
in
its
brief.
the
primary
product
of
that
violation
was
the
very
objective
sought
by
that
violation,
partin's
evidence
of
jury
tampering.
the
bonus
was
test
fleet
defense
information,
both
primary
product
and
bonus
were
obtained
by
one
man
in
one
continuous
process
carried
on
in
the
same
places
over
the
same
period
of
time
and
reported
daily
to
sheridan
in
the
same
reports.
to
separate
product
and
bonus
in
these
circumstances
would
be
to
treat
the
sixth
amendment
as
a
thing
of
water,
a
faucet
to
be
turned
on
and
off
as
partin
moved
from
one
part
of
defense
headquarters
to
another.
in
any
event,
as
follows
a
fortiori
from
comparable
cases
decided
by
this
court,
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
at
page
48,
footnote
2,
the
primary
objective
and
the
very
product
of
a
sixth
amendment
violation
of
any
constitutional
violation
cannot
be
separated
from
that
violation
for
in
those
circumstances,
we
have
much
more
than
the
take
which
connects
for
an
indirect
connection
evidence
with
a
constitutional
violation.
i
turn
to
our
argument
on
due
process.
to
the
question
of
whether
petitioners
were
afforded
the
essential
fairness
required
by
the
fifth
amendment.
a
secret
informer
may
it
please
the
court
seems
an
unlovely
thing
to
anyone.
yet
we
recognize
that
there
are
constitutional
uses
of
government
informers.
we
rely
on
much
more
than
the
evil
of
a
secret
government
informer
in
this
proceeding.
the
use
of
a
government
informer,
a
secret
informer
always
risks
perjury
but
that
risk
was
at
its
highest
here
in
view
of
the
charges
pending
against
partin
and
in
view
of
his
natural
desire
to
justify
the
payments
to
his
wife
no
matter
for
what
those
payments
were
made.
as
(inaudible)
teaches,
your
honors
decision
in
that
case,
the
risk
of
perjury
in
a
government
secret
informer's
testimony
may
be
so
great
as
in
and
of
itself
to
invalidate
a
conviction.
but
there
was
more
here
than
the
strong
risk
of
perjury
to
condemn
the
convictions
here.
the
government
unquestionably
ignored
sixth
amendment
rights
in
relation
to
the
test
fleet
defense
unquestionably
in
our
opinion
on
this
record.
but
putting
aside
our
other
legal
protections,
the
government's
conduct
was
at
a
minimum
within
the
penumbra
of
practically
every
fourth
amendment
guarantee
of
sixth
amendment
rights
to
counsel
in
this
proceeding,
of
fifth
amendment
rights
to
self
incrimination
in
this
proceeding.
whatever
the
legal
consequences
of
the
government's
action
separately
considered
under
each
amendment
may
be,
the
government
did
invade
the
privacy
of
the
man's
home.
did
infiltrate
the
counsels
of
this
defense
and
did
deprive
him
of
the
opportunity
to
consult
counsel
and
to
remain
silent.
finally,
as
the
government
does
not
contest
it
had
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
charge
on
--
and
charge
on
jury
tampering
on
october
25th.
on
that
day,
legitimate
law
enforcement
call
for
arrest
and
charge
with
a
fair
trial
to
follow.
by
deferring
arrest
and
charge,
and
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
attended
upon
such
arrest
and
charge
as
recently
explicated
by
this
court
in
this
term,
the
government
effectively
nullified
those
rights
secured
many
more
incriminating
admissions
and
rendered
petitioner's
trial
a
near
formality.
that
is
the
whole
of
the
government's
conduct
which
we
say
is
offensive
to
due
process
case
up
here.
in
conclusion
on
the
whole
case
we
observe
that
the
government
offers
extraneous
reasons
to
explain
its
conduct
in
this
case
but
we
stand
here
on
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
as
the
court
observed
in
united
states
against
(inaudible),
the
constitution
is
designed
to
place
obstacles
in
the
way
of
a
two
permeating
police
surveillance.
partin
surveillance
in
behalf
of
the
government
in
this
case
was
so
permeating
as
to
short
circuit
the
productive
protective
power
of
practically
every
constitutional
safeguard
on
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws.
we
respectfully
submit
that
on
the
well
settled
principles
of
constitutional
law,
the
facts
here
show
that
the
statements
were
inadmissible.
all
petitioners
were
prejudiced
by
those
statements
which
the
jury
was
permitted
to
consider
against
all
of
them
as
one
organic
tissue
of
proof
following
denial
of
their
motions
to
severance.
all
of
their
convictions
should
be
reversed.
whatever
remaining
time
may
the
court
please,
i
reserve
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
thank
you.
as
to
the
question
of
consent
that
he
knew
partin's
identity,
he
admitted
him
to
his
suite,
he
was
at
all
times
free
to
throw
him
out.
this
is
a
cynical
argument
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
he
did
not
know
that
this
was
the
government,
the
police
and
consent
under
those
circumstances
can
only
have
reference
to
waiver,
waiver
of
the
right
to
be
in
his
home
free
of
unreasonable
government
intrusion
and
as
to
that
waiver,
any
such
waiver
he
couldn't
waive
anything
unless
his
rights
were
intelligently
and
understandably
understood
and
waived
and
they
couldn't
have
been
in
this
case
when
he
did
not
know
of
the
critical
fact
that
this
was
a
cop.
now,
and
this
has
been
held
in
conley
v.
cochran
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
cited
at
page
35
and
settled
may
it
please
the
court
since
go-bart
importing
company
when
the
police
came
to
this
house,
came
on
the
porch
and
said
we
have
a
warrant.
they
at
least,
you
knew
they
were
police
and
they
said
they
had
no
--
they
had
a
warrant
which
they
didn't
have
and
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
butler
that
used
to
sit
upon
this
bench
held
that
because
of
that
deception,
because
of
a
general
search
for
evidence,
because
of
the
absence
of
a
warrant
as
is
exactly
true
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
a
couple
of
little
things
in
respect
to
one
question
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
black's
as
to
the
payments
to
partin,
the
memo
from
sheridan
in
the
department
of
justice
to
the
late
mr.
andrada
ordering
these
payments
said
in
connection
with
the
forthcoming
trials
in
nashville,
tennessee
it
is
requested
that
a
check
in
the
amount
of
$300
be
drawn
against
the
confidential
fund
beginning
june
--
july
8
and
this
is
dated
july
3,
1963
and
it
is
also
requested
that
a
check
be
drawn
each
month
from
november
1963
make
payable
to
mr.
grimsley,
not
a
word
about
his
expenses
on
these
trips
nor
any
substantiation
of
them.
now,
as
to
a
question
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
black
or
it
might
have
been
the
chief
justice,
i
forget
in
my
weariness,
whether
partin
invited
himself
to
see
mr.
hoffa
in
nashville
or
whether
mr.
hoffa
invited
partin
there
was
a
somewhat
uncertain
answer
by
government
counsel
but
i
would
refer
the
court
to
pages
1434
and
1438
which
set
forth
those
12
telephone
conversations
and
there
was
absolutely
no
question
that
mr.
partin
invited
himself
to
nashville.
does
this
mean
my
time
is
over?
mr.
joseph
a.
fanelli
if
i
may
i
have
one
more
thing
i
wanted
to
comment
and
it
will
be
my
final
comment.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
government
counsel
made
a
reference
to
as
our
society
--
to
something
about
as
our
society
gets
more
and
more
complicated,
criminal
activities
become
more
and
more
sophisticated
might
have
been
the
word.
i
thought
he
was
talking
about
the
department
of
justice
and
i
mean
that
and
not
jokingly
until
he
referred
to
espionage
and
then
i
know
that
well
that
couldn't
be
the
department.
but
in
this
type
of
issue
on
the
questions
and
constitutional
issues
presented
here,
this
court
has
always
found
that
more
pertinent
to
observe
that
as
its
decisions
have
caught
up
with
this
unconstitutional
police
invasion
of
the
constitution
and
that
one
hardly
anybody
maybe
gets
the
fair
degree
today
the
methods
of
the
police
in
invading
constitutional
requirements
become
more
and
more
sophisticated
and
therefore
as
has
been
said
by
this
court,
this
court
must
be
vigilant
in
liberal
construction
of
these
constitutional
requirements
to
see
that
their
basic
intent
and
purpose
is
observed.
thank
you
very
much.
