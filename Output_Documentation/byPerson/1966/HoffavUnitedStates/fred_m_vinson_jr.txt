mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutional
propriety
of
conviction
of
four
petitioners
charged
with
violating
the
obstruction
of
justice
statute
by
jury
tampering.
the
jury
tampering
activities
disclosed
by
the
record
occurred
at
a
trial
at
which
defendant
hoffa
was
the
only
defendant.
this
case
and
others
set
immediately
preceding
and
immediately
following
have
very
broad
implications
bearing
upon
the
use
by
law
enforcement
of
an
investigative
technique,
law
enforcements
has
always
found
to
be
important
at
the
use
of
informants.
before
summarizing
the
facts,
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
limited
order
of
the
court
in
granting
certiorari.
in
doing
this
of
course,
the
court
acted
in
accordance
with
its
practice
and
phrased
the
question
as
presented
by
petitioner.
there
the
question
referred
to
the
government's
deceptively
placing
a
secret
informer
with
defendant.
the
government's
position
amply
borne
out
in
the
record
and
by
the
court's
findings
is
simply
that
it
did
not
place
the
informant
anywhere
deceptively
or
otherwise.
i
would
also
at
this
point
like
to
clear
up
several
matters
that
counsel
referred
to
concessions
made
by
the
government.
the
government
does
not
concede
that
even
if
the
facts
proved
as
the
question
is
posed
were
true
that
petitioners
would
prevail
in
this
cause.
secondly,
in
response
to
questions
from
justices
harlan
and
stewart
earlier
this
morning,
counsel
for
petitioners
seems
to
state
that
the
government
had
conceded
that
there
had
been
an
illegal
entry
in
this
case.
there
has
been
no
such
concession.
in
addition,
on
page
9
of
petitioner's
reply
brief,
there's
another
concession
improperly
made
or
improperly
attributed
to
the
government.
the
reply
brief
says
that
the
government
explicitly
admits
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
violated
by
the
government's
very
presence
in
the
protected
counsels
of
the
petitioners.
the
government
makes
no
such
concession.
the
facts
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
think
the
facts
indicate
the
contrary
and
we
do
argue
the
legal
point
of
the
contrary,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
the
facts
in
the
case
can
best
be
understood
when
they
are
broken
down
into
two
parts.
the
occurrences
which
preceded
the
nashville
trial,
that's
the
trial
at
the
test
fleet
case
where
the
jury
tampering
took
place
and
secondly
the
occurrences
during
that
trial
which
led
to
the
charges
in
the
chattanooga
case
which
is
before
the
court.
now,
you've
heard
many
inferences
drawn
by
able
counsel
for
the
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
facts.
i
think
in
connection
with
the
facts
it
would
be
helpful
to
start
off
on
page
58
of
the
government's
brief
with
the
trial
court's
findings.
now,
these
were
findings
that
the
conclusion
of
the
initial
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
partin's
testimony.
the
court
said
that
it
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
motion
to
suppress
should
be
overruled
having
observed
the
manner
and
demeanor
of
the
witness
on
the
witness
stand
and
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
i
would
find
that
there
has
been
interference
with
the
government
with
any
attorney-client
relationship
of
any
defendant
in
this
case.
i
would
further
find
that
the
government
did
not
place
this
witness
mr.
partin
in
the
defendant's
midst
or
have
anything
to
do
with
placing
him
in
their
midst
rather
that
he
was
knowingly
and
voluntarily
placed
in
their
midst
by
one
of
the
defendants.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
did
not
mr.
justice.
however,
he
amplified
these
findings
in
denying
motions
for
a
new
trial
when
the
whole
panoply
of
evidence
was
in.
he
felt
necessary
to
do
this
in
light
of
the
petitioner's
contentions
that
evidence
subsequently
introduced,
introduced
after
the
motion
to
suppress
affected
these
findings.
now,
in
answer
to
this,
the
trial
judge
stated
that
the
additional
evidence
in
no
way
altered
the
court's
finding
that
the
government
did
not
place
or
keep
partin
with
the
defendant
hoffa
nor
does
it
relate
to
or
alter
the
court's
finding
that
there
was
no
illegal
interference
with
defendant
hoffa's
right
to
counsel.
now,
in
this
memorandum,
the
denial
of
the
new
trial
where
the
previous
findings
were
amplified,
a
court
further
found
one,
that
partin
remained
in
nashville
or
returned
to
nashville
either
at
the
request
of
or
with
the
consent
of
defendant
hoffa
and
not
at
the
instruction
of
the
government.
secondly,
that
the
government
requested
of
partin
only
that
he
report
information
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activity
of
which
he
became
aware.
and
third
that
partin
furnished
such
information.
now,
these
findings
are
amply
supported
by
the
record.
but
finally
the
court
held
that
the
presence
of
partin
during
the
course
of
the
nashville
trial,
the
test
fleet
trial
and
the
reporting
of
information
by
him
at
that
time
did
not
in
any
way
relate
to
the
rights
of
the
defendants,
the
petitioners
here
in
the
preparation
and
trial
of
the
chattanooga
case.
now,
in
the
face
of
these
findings
i
don't
think
the
inferences
that
either
counsel
for
the
petitioner
or
counsel
for
the
government
to
draw
or
particularly
important.
however,
in
view
of
the
due
process
argument
i
think
its
incumbent
on
the
government
to
respond
to
--
certain
of
the
inferences
drawn
to
the
facts.
now,
in
1962
the
time
of
the
national
test
fleet
trial,
edward
partin
as
we've
heard
was
an
official
of
local
no.
5
of
the
teamsters
union
in
baton
rouge,
louisiana.
since
1957
he
had
been
a
close
associate
of
petitioner
hoffa.
it's
true
that
in
late
september
1962
partin
was
in
a
state
jail
in
louisiana
on
a
kidnapping
charge.
this
charge
arose
from
a
family
dispute
in
which
partin
assisted
his
best
friend,
a
father
in
taking
his
children
away
from
his
estranged
wife
and
kidnapping
in
louisiana
is
an
unbailable
offense
until
the
victim
is
returned
unharmed.
at
that
time,
the
children
had
not
been
returned.
at
the
same
time
partin
was
on
bail
on
a
federal
charge,
a
violation
of
labor
management
purporting
in
disclosure
act.
now,
still
in
late
september,
partin
met
twice
with
state
prosecutors
on
successive
days.
at
these
meetings
as
counsel
has
stated,
he
related
to
these
state
officials
an
alleged
plan
by
petitioner
hoffa
to
murder
robert
kennedy
who
was
then
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
the
local
officials
reported
this
matter
to
the
fbi
and
at
their
suggestion
he
reported
on
to
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
new
orleans.
the
assistant
then
called
frank
grimsley
whom
you've
already
heard,
a
department
of
justice
attorney
who
in
turn
called
walter
sheridan.
now,
the
substance
of
these
calls
was
and
this
is
the
first
contact
of
the
federal
establishment
with
this
man
and
this
context.
the
substance
of
these
calls
was
that
partin
wished
to
speak
to
a
representative
of
the
department
about
a
gray
matter
involving
security.
now
there
resulted
two
meetings
to
between
partin
and
two
state
officials
and
two
federal
officials.
at
the
first
of
these
on
october
2
or
october
3,
the
record
is
not
clear,
partin
repeated
his
allegation
about
this
alleged
plan
to
murder
the
attorney
general.
the
testimony
is
that
if
hoffa's
impending
national
trial
was
mentioned
at
all,
it
was
by
way
of
a
casual
remark.
several
days
later,
a
second
meeting
took
place
between
the
same
people
except
for
one
state
official
who
was
missing
and
it
was
not
clear
what
was
discussed
at
this
meeting.
the
record
is
silent.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
was
present
however
testified
that
he
--
as
to
this
meeting
he
couldn't
recall
whether
hoffa's
name
came
up
at
all.
it's
also
not
clear
whether
partin
was
in
jail
at
this
time
because
by
then
the
children
had
been
returned
to
their
mother
and
the
offense
then
became
bailable.
now
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
an
attorney
on
the
criminal
division
of
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
at
a
headquartered
generally
in
atlanta.
i
understand
as
his
primary
responsibility
was
in
that
southeastern
area,
new
orleans,
georgia.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no
sir.
he
may
have
spent
a
substantial
amount
of
time
here
but
he's
also
i
think
it
could
fairly
be
said
to
be
headquartered
in
atlanta.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
understand
that
he
handled
generally
organized
crime
and
labor
racketeering
matters.
now,
in
the
meantime,
it's
now
been
several
days
since
news
of
--
was
given
to
the
federal
establishment
about
an
alleged
murder
attempt
or
plan.
the
fbi
was
conducting
an
investigation.
this
investigation
included
examinations
of
partin
by
polygraph
and
the
polygraph
expert
concluded
that
the
test
lent
support
to
partin's
allegation.
now,
at
about
this
same
point
in
time,
one
difficulty
with
the
facts
here
as
if
we
have
a
months
period
of
time
when
there
is
a
whole
lot
churning
and
a
lot
of
happening
and
a
lot
separate
interests
coalescing
but
about
this
same
point
in
time
october
6,
partin's
federal
bond
was
cancelled
by
a
bonding
company.
this
was
a
$50,000.00
bond
and
partin
had
to
go
to
local
friends
to
help
him
put
up
a
new
bond.
now,
the
bonding
company
which
canceled
was
a
business
interest
of
allen
dorfman
who
was
a
close
associate
and
friend
of
petitioner
hoffa's
and
later
he
was
a
codefendant
in
the
chattanooga
trial.
he
was
acquitted.
now,
hoffa
had
helped
get
this
bond
from
dorfman
so
partin
suspected
that
petitioner
hoffa
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
cancellation
and
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
it
and
find
out
really
if
and
why.
now,
also
about
this
time
around
october
6,
1962,
a
state
official
and
partin
moved
into
a
motel
in
baton
rouge.
this
--
there
was
some
testimony
to
the
effect
that
this
was
for
the
purpose
of
corroborating
information
that
partin
had
been
reporting
to
him,
the
state
official,
the
state
district
attorney
since
late
september
and
in
this
connection
for
this
purpose
the
state
district
attorney
testified
that
he
instructed
partin
in
the
use
of
a
recording
device
and
that
partin
recorded
between
80
and
a
hundred
telephone
calls
in
this
four
day
period
and
in
a
subsequent
three
day
period
now
only
two
of
these
recorded
calls
were
with
petitioner
hoffa.
and
the
defense
introduced
the
transcripts
of
those
calls
into
evidence.
now,
this
recording
equipment
of
course
belonged
to
the
state
and
the
state
officer
was
acting
in
his
capacity
as
a
state
officer.
testimony
is
clear
that
he
hadn't
been
asked
to
pursue
this
investigation
by
the
federal
government.
now,
in
between
the
two
recorded
calls
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear
with
respect
to
the
state
interest
involved.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no,
between
80
and
100
in
a
seven-day
period.
four
days
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
all
the
calls
weren't
record.
there
were
--
there
was
a
--
there
were
a
substantial
number
of
other
calls
but
this
number
was
recorded.
there
is
testimony
to
that
effect.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
they
were
--
the
ones
to
petitioner
hoffa
were
long
distance
but
in
the
quantity
of
these
calls,
they
were
both
incumbent.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
they
--
the
testimony
is
clear
in
this
respect
there
was
an
induction
device
which
was
placed
on
the
outside
of
the
telephone
instrument
and
of
course
partin
did
the
placing
and
partin
was
the
operator
of
the
telephone
call,
so
i
don't
think
that
for
purposes
of
section
605,
that
would
be
a
wiretap
but
in
any
event
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
because
the
defendant
introduced
them
into
evidence.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
partin,
his
--
certainly
as
to
his
side
the
conversation
because
he
fixed
the
device
to
the
telephone.
but
in
any
event
the
--
mr.
grimsley,
the
department
of
justice
attorney
testified
that
he
had
nothing
with
the
recordings
and
he
did
not
know
what
the
louisiana
state
officials
and
partin's
real
purpose
was
in
making
this
vast
amount
of
calls.
the
record
is
also
not
clear
as
to
when
the
federal
government
received
knowledge
of
the
specifics
of
these
calls
or
copies
of
the
recordings
but
the
government
was
certainly
advised
of
their
general
content,
well
at
least
of
the
general
contents
of
the
last
call,
the
october
18th
call
on
that
same
day
which
was
four
days
before
the
nashville
trial
commenced.
now,
following
this
last
recorded
call,
the
transcript
of
which
is
in
evidence,
this
is
the
call
of
petitioner
hoffa
on
one
hand
and
partin
on
the
other
hand,
both
the
state
officials
who
was
involved
and
partin
told
mr.
grimsley,
the
department
attorney
that
hoffa
had
invited
partin
to
nashville
and
grimsley
so
understood
it.
grimsley
then
reported
the
gist
of
this
conversation
to
mr.
sheridan
and
mr.
sheridan
in
turn
told
grimsley
to
ask
partin
to
call
sheridan
in
nashville
if
he
saw
any
evidence
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activity.
it
was
his
18th
call
at
which
the
plans
between
mr.
hoffa
and
mr.
partin
were
finalized
as
to
when
they
would
get
together.
now,
this
request
to
partin
was
conveyed
to
him
by
grimsley
at
a
meeting
in
atlanta
on
october
20
were
two
days
before
the
trial.
this
conversation
or
this
meeting
concerned
many
matters
other
than
the
nashville
trial.
the
testimony
is
that
during
the
major
part
of
the
meeting
other
things
were
discussed,
but
eventually
the
conversation
turned
to
the
--
to
partin
going
to
nashville
and
grimsley
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
comply
with
hoffa's
request,
that
partin
meeting.
after
partin
said
that
he
did
plan
to
meet
the
petitioner
hoffa,
grimsley
asked
him
to
keep
his
eyes
and
ears
open
and
should
he
observe
any
evidence
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activity
to
report
it
to
mr.
sheridan
in
nashville.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
record
is
not
at
all
adequate
in
this
respect
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
be
the
last
to
deny
that
the
federal
government
after
the
information
that
had
been
given
to
it
by
partin
that
information
to
go
back
was
the
plan
to
murder
a
member
of
the
cabinet
and
i
believe
counsel
adverted
this
morning
to
another
matter,
the
bribery
of
an
nlrb
official.
with
that
information
in
hand,
the
government
was
naturally
interested
in
mr.
partin
getting
any
further
information
in
that
regard
that
he
could.
the
government
didn't
care
whether
the
meeting
was
in
new
jersey,
washington
or
nashville.
this
is
what
i
referred
to
previously
as
everything
happened
here
within
a
months
period.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
in
jail
mr.
justice
on
a
non-bailable
offense,
kidnapping.
under
louisiana
law
however
if
the
victim
in
this
case,
the
child
of
a
friend
of
his
was
--
is
returned
unharmed
it
becomes
a
bailable
offense.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
following
the
return
of
the
children
a
bail
was
fixed
at
i
believe
$5000
or
$6000
for
that
offense.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
he
did.
and
the
charge
was
later
dismissed
because
the
mother
refused
to
testify
against
her
husband
and
the
charges
were
invalid.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct.
he'd
always
been
out
on
the
federal
offense.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
they
got
five
or
six
local
friends
to
put
up
the
bond
for
him.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
there
were
several
other
charges
the
--
there
was
something
said
about
an
automobile
accident
in
alabama
which
may
have
been
involved
a
manslaughter
charge.
there
was
also
something
said
about
--
there
was
also
something
said
about
a
charge
for
battery
and
perjury.
however,
the
record
is
clear
that
this
occurred
after
the
nashville
trial
sometime
in
1963
and
he
was
acquitted
of
the
battery
charge
and
the
perjury
charge
which
grew
out
of
the
battery
charge
was
null.
that's
a
state
charge.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
federal
charge
in
my
recollection
is
--
was
the
spring
or
early
summer
of
1962.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
what
was
the
precise
date
of
the
embezzlement
indictment?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
federal
charge
is
still
pending.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
might
add
in
connection
with
that
mr.
justice
that
the
federal
indictment
was
returned
june
22,
1962,
period
of
time
where
you're
concerned
with
this
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
is
october
of
1962.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
it
was
a
26
count
indictment
i
believe
went
back
in
1961
mr.
chief
justice.
as
mr.
justice
black
points
out
the
indictment
has
been
pending
for
four
years.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
record
of
course
was
not
too
long
after
the
charge
was
brought.
i
can
--
i
plan
actually
to
review
this
matter
after
this
case
is
disposed
of
by
the
supreme
court.
we
have
--
i
personally
felt
that
if
the
department
of
justice
under
attack
because
of
this
indictment
either
dismiss
or
proceeded
that
we
would
be
--
we
were
on
the
horns
of
the
dilemma.
the
--
i
intend
to
have
an
independent
review
made
of
the
matter
and
will
dispose
of
it
in
accordance
with
that.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
can
in
no
way
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
can
in
no
way
take
that
position.
however,
petitioners
make
a
broad
due
process
argument
that
really
relates
to
the
inherent
fairness
of
the
government's
conduct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
certainly
an
informant
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
--
of
the
government.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
his
information
was
used
by
the
government.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
i
know
how
you
define
that
term
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
mean
was
he
on
the
payroll?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
was
an
undercover
agent,
no.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
not
compensated
at
all.
the
$1200
which
was
paid
him,
this
is
something
that
i
plan
to
get
into,
the
$1200
that
was
paid
him
following
the
nashville
trial
was
compensation
for
expenses
both
travel
and
per
diem
in
the
period
between
the
nashville
and
the
chattanooga
trial
in
assisting
the
government
to
prepare
for
trial.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no,
the
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
in
candor,
the
accounting
was
not
too
good.
the
--
a
piece
of
paper
was
introduced
showing
the
trips
he
had
made
and
the
airfare,
the
amount
of
time
he
had
spent
in
the
per
diem
and
it
was
added
up
and
it
came
to
some
1500
and
i
believe
23
some
$300
plus
more
than
was
paid
him
through
mrs.
partin.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
obligated
to
pay
her
$300
a
month
support
for
her
and
some
children.
he
asked
that
it
be
paid
in
this
manner
because
he
said
i
can
--
i
believe
his
words
were,
i
can
take
care
of
myself.
you
pay
it
this
way.
also,
i
might
add
that
there
was
a
security
aspect
in
making
the
payments
in
indirect
manner.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
felt
that
it
would
better
if
the
--
if
those
involved
did
not
know
at
that
time
that
he
was
an
informer
for
the
government.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
they
were
made
to
her
in
installments
of
either
$300
or
$150
over
a
period
of
a
few
months
commencing
in
july
1963.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
for
the
short
period
of
time.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
when
the
payments
were
commenced
it
was
recognized
that
there
as
money
owing
for
reimbursed
expenses
and
travel
and
it
was
commenced
and
$1200
was
paid,
a
total
and
according
to
these
figures,
the
government
still
owes
mr.
partin
some
$300.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
don't
know
why
they
stopped
the
$1200
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no,
it
did
not
mr.
justice.
that
was
justice
black's
question
this
morning
which
counsel
for
the
petitioner
referred
to
immediately
after
the
noon
recess.
the
union
local
no.
5
had
paid
for
mr.
partin's
expenses
in
connection
with
those
11
trips.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no
sir,
we
think
not.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
legally?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct
sir
except
for
the
due
process
argument.
now,
as
to
--
we
no
have
--
we
now
have
mr.
partin
arriving
in
nashville
on
october
22nd.
now
some
may
have
the
impression
that
the
accommodations
of
petitioner
hoffa
were
for
a
tight
knit
so-called
defense
camp
of
lawyers
and
the
defendant.
such
--
just
is
not
the
case.
petitioner
hoffa's
own
testimony
and
that
of
his
associates
makes
it
clear
that
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
union
officials,
acquaintances,
friends
and
associates
through
these
quarters.
there's
testimony
that
reference
has
been
made
to
partin
eating
with
lawyers.
well,
there's
testimony
that
people
often
ate
in
groups
of
ten,
15
or
20.
on
page
118
of
volume
i
of
the
record,
there
is
a
picture
of
petitioner
hoffa
and
11
of
his
friends
and
associates
leaving
the
hotel
in
nashville
during
the
trial
and
only
two
of
those
in
the
picture
are
attorneys.
now,
when
mr.
partin
of
petitioner
hoffa's.
with
him
was
a
man
who
introduced
himself
as
arthur
--
as
anthony
quinn.
now,
this
anthony
quinn
later
that
day
reintroduced
himself
by
his
correct
name
twill
and
this
is
according
to
partin
and
said
that
mr.
dorfman
had
ask
him,
twill,
to
come
to
nashville
and
help
him
get
to
the
jury.
twill
in
his
testimony
admitted
to
a
conversation
with
partin
but
he
denied
the
balance
of
partin's
testimony
in
this
regard.
in
connection
with
this
first
day,
partin
also
testified
that
hoffa
said,
petitioner
hoffa
said
that
twill
was
in
nashville
to
help
him.
now,
also
on
october
22nd,
the
first
day,
petitioner
king
told
partin
that
there
was
a
meeting
on
the
jury
that
night.
later
that
evening,
partin
testified
that
petitioner
hoffa
told
him
"that
they
was
get
to
one
juror
or
try
to
get
to
a
few
scattered
jurors
and
take
their
chances."
now,
partin
that
afternoon
or
evening
called
sheridan
to
report
all
or
some
of
the
above
occurrences
relating
to
jury
tampering
and
later
that
day,
october
22nd
met
with
him
personally.
the
next
day,
october
23rd,
before
partin
left
nashville
petitioner
hoffa
told
him
that
he,
hoffa
might
want
partin
to
pass
something
for
him
when
partin
return.
now,
as
on
the
side
here,
i
should
say
that
partin's
testimony
with
respect
to
particular
conversations
with
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
and
with
defendants
below
dorfman
and
twill
were
denied
by
them
at
trial
but
this
also
points
out
the
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
were
denied
by
these
individuals
at
trial.
but
this
also
points
out
the
discrimination
displayed
by
the
chattanooga
jury
for
there
was
a
substantial
approved
aside
from
partin
that
these
petitioners
made
efforts
to
get
a
jurors
pascual
and
fields
and
there
was
less
proof
as
to
the
involvement
of
defendants
dorfman
and
twill
who
were
acquitted
along
with
petitioner
hoffa
on
count
four
of
the
indictment.
now,
the
details
of
proof
as
to
the
actual
efforts
to
reach
jurors
are
spelled
out
in
detail
in
the
brief.
i
think
there's
no
need
to
go
into
that.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
i
have
two
references
to
that,
volume
2
r,
page
261
and
volume
3
r,
page
819.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
now
during
the
remaining
22
days
approximately
that
partin
was
in
nashville
during
the
trial
both
petitioners
hoffa
and
petitioner
king
made
a
number
of
statements
relating
to
jury
tampering,
incriminating
statements
to
partin.
or
hoffa
berated
petitioner
king
in
--
about
his
inefficiency
in
this
jury
tampering
efforts
and
this
was
in
hoffa's
--
this
was
in
partin's
presence.
counsel
for
petitioners
made
much
of
the
fact
in
his
fourth
amendment
argument
that
this
was
a
different
sort
of
overhearing.
this
wasn't
a
face
to
face
conversation
which
the
auditor
was
intended
to
hear
but
the
record
in
this
regard
makes
clear
that
partin
was
on
the
scene,
was
known
to
be
on
the
scene
and
was
intended
that
he
overhear
this
conversation
so
that
no
real
distinction
in
that
respect.
the
statements
that
were
told
to
partin
or
that
were
made
in
his
known
presence
included
one
that
petitioner
hoffa
made
with
respect
to
having
the
male
negro
juror
in
his
hip
pocket.
these
statements
as
to
jury
tampering
were
all
passed
on
to
mr.
sheridan
by
partin
either
personally
or
by
phone.
with
respect
to
the
statement
as
to
this
particular
juror
fields
was
the
only
male
negro
on
the
jury.
now,
there's
no
dispute
that
partin
call
sheridan
or
met
with
him
often
perhaps
daily
when
in
nashville
during
the
trial.
these
reports
were
all
oral.
mr.
sheridan
received
partin's
reports
without
comment.
he
never
gave
partin
instructions
as
to
what
to
do
or
not
to
do.
he
didn't
ask
him
to
stay
in
nashville.
now,
when
information
as
to
the
jury
tampering
was
received
by
sheridan,
he
would
turn
it
over
to
the
fbi.
the
fbi
would
then
investigate
and
seek
to
corroborate
it.
when
the
investigation
eventually
or
eventuated
into
a
great
substance
corroboration
of
the
partin
reports,
remedial
steps
were
taken
by
advising
the
court.
this
led
in
december
of
the
trial
first
to
the
disqualification
of
juror
pascual
and
then
to
the
disqualification
of
juror
fields.
we've
already
discussed
the
matter
of
payment
and
the
confusion
about
payment
in
the
record.
the
record
that
probably
is
the
most
contradictory
with
respect
to
partin's
access
to
the
quarters
and
counsels
of
the
defense.
petitioner
hoffa
had
five
attorneys
of
record
during
the
trial
and
three
other
attorneys
were
with
him
during
part
or
all
of
the
trial.
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
throngs
of
non-lawyers
who
were
passing
through
and
in
and
out
of
these
premises.
partin
testified
that
he
was
in
and
around
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
and
for
a
period
of
time,
he
did
act
as
doorman.
he
also
testified
that
he
frequently
saw
and
occasionally
conferred
with
petitioner
hoffa's
attorneys.
in
essence,
his
testimony
was
that
he
made
no
effort
to
be
present
at
conversations
involving
attorneys.
he
might
have
been
but
he
did
not
know
what
they
were
talking
about.
he's
a
man
with
a
tenth
grade
education.
he
stated
that
the
attorneys
would
move
you
out
as
he
expressed
it
when
they
were
discussing
the
case
and
he
didn't
think
that
he
ever
reported
anything
told
him
by
an
attorney
because
sheridan
wasn't
interested
in
that.
now,
sheridan's
testimony
with
one
exception
is
not
to
the
contrary.
sheridan
testified
that
partin
passed
on
to
him
information
as
to
the
comings
and
goings
of
people,
jury
tampering
efforts,
happenings
that
were
perhaps
illegal,
certainly
unethical
and
a
very
few
comments
generally
related
to
the
trial.
at
no
time
did
sheridan
receive
any
documents
or
any
copies
of
documents
from
partin.
now,
i
refer
to
one
exception,
the
counsel
referred
to
as
this
morning.
this
was
--
this
exception
concern
an
oral
report
by
partin
that
sheridan
understood
to
mean
a
lawyer
was
writing
out
questions
and
answers
for
a
group
of
witnesses
to
memorize.
partin
did
not
convey
to
sheridan
the
questions
and
answers
themselves
but
merely
the
fact
that
there
were
questions
and
answers.
now,
the
defense
testimony
which
in
regard
to
access,
you
heard
summarized
in
part
this
morning,
it
contains
a
number
of
internal
inconsistencies
as
to
the
degree
of
partin's
presence
and
his
participation.
but
actually
petitioner
hoffa's
own
testimony
which
is
found
at
volume
iv
of
the
record
at
page
1396
gives
the
impression
that
i
could
characterize
a
testimony
as
giving
the
impression
that
he
saw
partin
very
little
during
the
trial.
he
was
busy
and
he
didn't
find
time
to
sit
down
with
him
to
talk
about
the
union
business
until
late
in
the
trial.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
testimony?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
or
didn't
see
him
much
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
--
around
the
headquarter
suite
during
the
trial.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
in
any
event,
that's
what
he
did
testify,
mr.
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
now,
before
turning
to
our
legal
argument,
i
would
just
touch
upon
one
matter
i've
already
briefly
alluded
to
and
that's
the
government's
reasonable
apprehension
before
the
nashville
trial
that
there
would
be
efforts
to
reach
the
jury
in
nashville.
this
apprehension
proved
to
be
fully
justified.
now,
on
the
first
morning
of
the
trial
at
about
or
just
before
mr.
partin
arrived,
a
prospective
juror
reported
to
the
court
an
improper
phone
call
from
someone
posing
as
a
newspaper
reporter.
two
more
such
calls
were
received
--
well,
two
more
of
such
reports
from
jurors
were
made
the
following
day.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
october
22nd
was
the
first
report,
first
day
of
trial.
partin's
report
of
course
on
the
afternoon
or
evening
of
october
22nd
when
he
had
just
arrived
in
town
confirmed
these
fears
and
on
october
24,
this
is
the
third
day
of
trial
and
it
was
before
the
jury
was
actually
sworn,
james
tippens
who
had
been
tentatively
ceded
as
a
juror
on
the
preceding
day
reported
to
the
court
that
a
neighbor
had
offered
him
$10,000
in
$100
bills
in
connection
with
his
prospective
service
at
the
trial.
now,
the
court
advised
petitioner
hoffa
and
counsel
for
both
sides
in
the
nashville
trial
of
this
report
and
excused
tippens
from
the
jury.
mr.
partin
testified
that
when
he
returned
to
nashville
on
the
25th
that
petitioner
hoffa
related
this
instant
to
him
and
commented
that
we're
going
to
have
to
lie
low
a
few
days.
so
at
this
very
early
stage
in
the
proceeding
it
was
quite
apparent
to
the
government
that
a
large
scale
attack
on
the
integrity
of
this
jury
in
this
trial
was
well
under
way.
the
activities
of
this
nature
ultimately
culminated
with
12
defendants
charge
with
nine
separate
endeavors
to
obstruct
and
in
six
persons
convicted,
four
of
which
--
four
of
these
convictions
are
before
the
court
in
this
case.
and
of
course
the
case
immediately
preceding
this,
the
osborne
cases
involved
a
similar
charge
in
the
succeeding
chattanooga
case.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
medland
was
--
mr.
medland
was
convicted
and
you
denied
cert
i
believe
was
in
recent
days.
and
bell
was
the
other
gentleman
which
cert
was
denied
there
also.
now,
i
should
make
clear
that
the
government's
position
and
the
government's
basic
arguments
don't
depend
on
the
practical
necessities
of
this
case.
this
is
what
the
government
was
confronted
with
and
had
to
deal
with
from
the
first
day
of
the
trial
but
our
basic
arguments
don't
depend
on
those
practical
necessities.
but
we
do
ask
the
court
to
consider
these
exigencies
in
connection
with
the
basic
question
of
fairness
presented.
now,
this
leads
me
into
a
discussion
of
the
sixth
amendment
argument
raised
by
petitioners.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
our
legal
position
would
be
the
same,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
the
legal
issue
upon
which
certiorari
has
been
granted
concerns
the
admissibility
in
chattanooga
of
the
evidence
obtained
by
the
government
from
partin
during
the
nashville
test
fleet
case.
more
precisely
the
issues
whether
partin's
testimony
with
respect
to
jury
tampering
efforts
should
have
been
excluded
at
the
chattanooga
trial
as
having
been
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth,
fifth
or
sixth
amendment.
now,
the
context
however
for
determining
this
question
is
the
chattanooga
jury
fixing
case
and
not
the
nashville
test
fleet
case.
it's
very
important
at
the
outset
of
the
sixth
amendment
argument
to
note
that
partin's
challenged
testimony
dealt
with
statements
made
to
him
by
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
concerning
current
or
future
endeavors
to
corrupt
the
nashville
jury.
the
sixth
amendment
certainly
does
not
make
privilege
every
statement
made
by
defendant
on
trial.
it
does
not
cloak
with
privilege
statements
made
concerning
criminal
offenses
which
are
planned
or
committed
during
trial.
if
a
defendant
tells
his
lawyer
that
he's
going
to
bribe
a
juror,
the
attorney
has
an
obligation
to
attempt
to
dissuade
his
client.
he
also
has
an
obligation
to
report
the
plan
of
felony
to
the
authorities.
the
law
is
clear
in
this
area,
the
clark
case
dicta
in
the
supreme
court,
in
in
re
sawyer,
seventh
circuit
case
and
many
others.
now,
an
informant
is
as
least
--
an
informant
is
at
least
as
free
to
report
and
testify
to
such
disclosures
as
the
attorney
of
the
person
who
makes
the
disclosures.
thus,
we
feel
that
the
short
answer
to
the
sixth
amendment
issue
is
that
petitioner
hoffa
and
petitioner
king's
remarks
as
to
which
partin
testified
were
clearly
unprivileged.
now,
with
further
reference
and
still
on
the
sixth
amendment
point
it's
important
to
note
that
the
issue
in
the
case
is
still
not
the
constitutional
standards
relating
to
the
nashville
trial
but
the
admissibility
of
evidence
at
the
chattanooga
trial.
now,
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
no
interference
with
sixth
amendment
rights
at
the
chattanooga
trial,
the
second
trial.
they
reasoned
and
we
argue
that
it's
not
necessary
any
fruit
of
the
poisoned
tree
argument
because
there
just
was
no
unlawful
invasion
by
the
government
of
defendant's
right
to
counsel
in
the
nashville
test
fleet
case.
but
in
any
event
as
i
will
develop
more
fully
in
a
moment,
the
partin's
testimony
was
not
in
any
sense
the
fruit
of
alleged
governmental
wrongdoing.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
they
take
the
position
that
the
entry
was
illegal.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
do
not
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
do
not
agree
with
that
position.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
--
the
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
and
we
take
the
position
that
one
who
is
told
by
petitioner
hoffa
that
he
is
committing
an
ongoing
criminal
act
has
the
right
and
indeed
a
duty
to
report
that
to
the
authorities.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
think
not
mr.
justice.
the
--
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
petitioners
advanced
the
fruit
of
the
wrongdoing
contention.
in
other
words
that
partin's
testimony,
the
facts
he
elicited
and
testified
to
were
the
fruits
of
his
wrongdoing
in
violating
sixth
amendment
rights.
we
feel
that
the
court
need
not
reach
this
argument
if
it
finds
there
was
no
violation
of
sixth
amendment
rights
at
nashville.
but
even
if
this
court
should
be
of
a
contrary
view,
that
conclusion
would
not
justify
reversal
of
these
convictions.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
would
consider
it.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
would
consider
it
improper
and
illegal
on
either
side
of
the
fence.
however,
i
would
not
consider
the
reporting
of
a
statement
made
as
to
ongoing
criminality
to
be
in
any
way
connected
with
the
sixth
amendment
rights
involved.
the
question
you
posed
with
respect
to
obstruction
of
justice
on
one
hand
and
the
sixth
amendment
violation
on
the
other
hand
really
illustrates
the
--
one
of
the
ironies
in
this
case
because
here
in
our
view
the
petitioners
seek
to
expand
the
umbrella
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
passes
a
very
basic
purpose,
the
protection
of
the
adversary
system
and
at
the
same
time
it's
charged
with
violations
of
section
1503,
the
statute
which
has
the
same
general
purposes.
but
getting
back
to
the
fruit
argument,
i
believe
that
in
this
court
the
petitioners
have
changed
the
thrust
of
their
argument
a
bit.
below,
they
argued
the
fruit
of
the
wrongdoing.
here
they
appear
to
take
the
position
that
it's
not
a
fruit
problem
but
rather
this
is
the
poisoned
tree
itself.
but
in
order
to
examine
this
issue
in
either
context.
we
first
should
recall
that
the
issue
is
the
admissibility
of
evidence
in
the
chattanooga
trial,
the
second
trial.
now,
the
alleged
wrongdoing
is
intrusion
by
the
government
upon
the
right
of
counsel
and
defendant's
right
and
counsel's
right
to
prepare
for
trial,
right
--
rights
which
are
protected
by
the
sixth
amendment.
with
regard
to
the
chattanooga
trial,
the
question
is
whether
any
alleged
infringement
of
petitioner's
rights
in
nashville
requires
the
exclusion
of
partin's
testimony
as
to
jury
tampering
efforts.
the
test
set
up
by
this
court
in
wong
sun,
the
test
for
determining
causal
connection
is
helpful
in
this
regard.
the
court
said
that
the
question
is
whether
granting
primary
illegality
the
evidence
has
been
come
at
by
exploitation
of
that
illegality.
now,
for
applying
this
test,
we
must
assume
arguendo
that
there
was
a
violation
of
sixth
amendment
rights.
it's
this
violation
the
alleged
communication
of
defense
strategy
which
we
feel
would
constitute
the
primary
illegality
under
the
wong
sun
test.
the
unprivileged
statements
regarding
jury
tampering
and
thus
partin's
testimony
was
not
--
come
at
in
any
sense
of
the
word
by
exploitation
of
that
illegality.
now,
here
partin
did
not
obtain
evidence
with
respect
to
jury
tampering
as
a
consequence
of
any
knowledge
that
he
gained
during
the
course
of
attorneys'
conferences
or
otherwise
related
to
the
operation
of
the
defense.
here
no
statement
petitioner
hoffa's,
no
statement
of
petitioner
king's
which
was
testified
to
by
partin
had
any
possible
relationship
to
any
legitimate
aspect
of
the
nashville
defense.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
that
question
of
course
--
that
question
is
--
would
be
--
if
we
were
here
talking
about
the
constitutional
propriety
of
the
nashville
trial
as
to
whether
the
defendant
--
the
defendant's
secret
information
had
been
fed
to
the
government.
if
that
were
the
fact,
i
would
agree
that
the
nashville
trial
would
fall
short
of
constitutional
standards.
but
here,
we
are
talking
about
the
chattanooga
trial
months
hence
at
which
partin
testified
to
the
jury
tampering
efforts
during
the
nashville
trial.
the
--
another
approach
to
the
sixth
amendment
problem
is
of
course
to
say
that
this
is
analogous
to
the
argument
we've
previously
made
as
to
say
that
the
sixth
amendment
defines
a
relationship.
it
doesn't
define
the
defense
camp
as
such.
it's
the
relationship
between
the
attorney
and
his
client,
their
right
to
prepare
for
trial.
now,
heartening
back
to
wong
sun,
the
court
held
that
wong
sun's
confession
made
after
his
illegal
arrest
was
not
the
fruit
of
the
government's
wrongdoing
because
following
his
release,
he
returned
voluntarily
several
days
later
to
make
his
statement.
now,
the
court's
holding
was
that
the
causal
connection
between
the
arrest
and
the
statement
was
so
attenuated
that
the
taint
was
dissipated.
there
was
a
connection
where
it
was
tenuous.
in
this
case,
we
urge
that
the
relationship
between
whatever
access
partin
had
to
defense
strategy
in
the
nashville
case
and
the
incriminating
statements
privately
made
to
him
is
far
more
tenuous
there
completely
unrelated
to
any
testimony
of
partin
in
chattanooga
bears
no
relationship
to
any
legitimate
aspect
of
the
defense
of
the
nashville
trial.
the
main
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
in
this
court
would
appear
to
be
the
fourth
amendment.
in
osborne
argued
immediately
preceding
these
cases,
the
fourth
amendment
was
adverted
to.
in
lewis,
the
case
immediately
following
the
fourth
amendment
is
virtually
the
only
issue.
as
the
fourth
amendment
issues
in
this
case,
in
lewis
particularly
are
so
closely
allied,
i
will
limit
my
argument
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment
to
--
a
response
to
petitioner's
principal
contentions.
but
before
doing
this,
i
think
it
would
help
to
focus
on
this
problem
to
set
forth
clearly
those
matters
about
which
there
is
no
dispute.
we
have
no
dispute
with
gouled.
we
have
no
dispute
with
any
of
the
cases
cited
by
petitioner.
these
are
the
matters
which
are
not
in
dispute.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
hotel
suite
occupied
by
the
petitioner
was
an
area
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
fourth
amendment
can
under
some
circumstances
be
violated
not
only
by
a
forceful
invasion
but
by
stealthy
or
deceptive
entry.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
however
on
pages
133
and
134
that
the
conduct
of
partin
did
not
amount
to
the
type
of
deceptive
invasion
prohibited
by
the
amendment.
petitioner
hoffa
knew
partin's
identity.
he
knew
that
he
posses
the
legal
right
to
exclude
him
and
he
knew
that
he
didn't
have
to
speak
to
him
anytime,
anyplace.
now,
petitioner's
brief
is
at
pangs
to
establish
that
verbal
statements
can
be
the
subject
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
we
do
not
disagree
but
petitioner
goes
on
to
state
that
every
statement,
every
statement
made
within
the
confines
of
a
protected
area
is
constitutionally
protected.
and
here,
we
sharply
disagree.
the
statements
made
by
petitioners
hoffa
or
petitioners
king
were
not
made
in
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
parties
were
at
that
time
in
the
hotel
suite
of
hoffa.
the
statements
bore
no
relationship
to
the
privacy
of
that
suite.
they
could
have
been
made
on
the
street,
an
open
field,
in
a
hotel
lobby.
in
fact,
some
of
the
statements,
two
pages
in
petitioner's
brief
is
devoted
to
setting
forth
these
statements
as
obvious
that
many
other
made
more
elsewhere
which
again
just
demonstrates
the
irrelevancy
of
the
place
where
statements
of
this
nature
and
quality
are
made.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
they
could
have
been
made
in
a
public
place,
a
place
not
within
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment,
an
open
field.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
--
a
person
has
the
protection.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
but
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
but
wherever
a
person
is,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
his
voluntary
statements
made
to
an
auditor.
the
--
that
sort
of
statement,
the
risk
the
person
runs
is
that
the
auditor
will
repeat
the
statements
and
that
risk
has
no
relation
to
the
place
of
a
state.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
indeed
it
does.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that
is
speaking
in
terms
of
place
and
not
to
whom.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
the
--
in
the
osborne
case
you
heard
argument
yesterday
and
this
morning
and
there
was
testimony
in
that
record
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
and
mr.
vick
going
to
the
alley
to
have
a
private
conversation,
dealing
at
the
alley
was
a
private
place.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
prior
decisions
upon
which
petitioner
appears
to
rely
aren't
inconsistent
really
with
our
analysis
of
the
protection
which
lies
behind
the
fourth
amendment,
the
silverman
case.
government
agents
there
eavesdropped
by
means
of
penetration
into
a
protected
area.
that
issue
just
isn't
present
in
this
case.
in
gouled
relied
on
most
forcefully
by
petitioners.
a
government
agent
pretended
to
make
a
friendly
call,
gained
entrance
in
that
deceptive
manner
and
then
when
the
owner
of
the
premises
was
absent
surreptitiously
took
documents.
in
this
case,
in
the
context
of
the
cases
before
the
court
here,
this
would
be
analogous
to
as
hiding
in
the
closet
and
overhearing
statements
which
were
not
intended
for
that
auditor
to
hear.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
resemble
in
some
ways
those
in
lopez
v.
united
states.
there,
an
internal
revenue
agent
pretended
deceptively
to
collaborate
in
defendant's
efforts
to
bribe
him.
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
unlawful
invasion
of
defendant's
office
because
of
this,
the
deception
and
pointed
out
that
he
did
not
violate
the
privacy
of
the
office
by
seizing
something
surreptitiously
without
petitioner's
knowledge.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
even
those
who
dissented
in
lopez
did
not
do
so
on
the
basis
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation
had
occurred
because
the
government
agent
had
not
disclosed
his
real
intentions.
in
fact
the
language
of
the
dissenters
supports
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
the
language
i
referred
to
is
that
which
relates
to
it
is
not
an
undue
risk
to
ask
persons
to
assume
for
it
does
no
more
than
compel
them
to
use
discretion
in
choosing
their
auditors
and
to
make
damaging
disclosures
only
to
persons
whose
character
and
motives
may
be
trusted.
there
is
a
final
important
point
which
was
emphasized
in
the
government's
brief
in
lewis.
it's
equally
applicable
here.
the
fourth
amendment
rule
contended
for
by
petitioner
would
very
seriously
hamper
the
government's
use
of
informants
as
i
have
pointed
out
there
is
no
logical
connection
between
the
privacy
of
a
fourth
amendment
area
and
the
fact
that
a
person
engaged
in
committing
a
crime
intentionally
makes
statements
to
an
informer.
now,
acceptance
of
petitioner's
fourth
amendment
argument
would
mean
that
the
government
would
be
completely
barred
from
using
the
testimony
of
an
informer
where
it
relates
to
statements
made
by
an
accused
to
the
informer
inside
the
accuser's
house,
his
apartment,
his
office,
his
automobile.
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
effective
use
of
informers
would
be
seriously
curtailed.
with
respect
to
the
general
subject
before
the
court,
the
use
of
informants,
there
is
unfortunately
crept
into
our
society
the
tendency
to
deprecate
private
citizens
who
assist
law
enforcement
agencies.
whether
that
assistance
be
a
physical
or
testimonial
and
this
of
course
is
true
in
spades
for
the
informant.
but
as
our
society
becomes
increasingly
complex
and
sophisticated,
so
does
the
rapacity
of
those
who
would
corrupt
society.
now,
continuing
criminal
schemes
such
as
those
involving
espionage
or
the
deprivation
of
civil
rights
has
as
an
important
part
of
its
code,
the
code
of
silence,
penetration
by
informants
is
virtually
essential
in
this
context.
now,
any
criminal
scheme
which
is
well
bank-rolled
and
well-planned
provides
a
very
substantial
amount
of
insulation
to
the
top
layers.
now,
this
is
particularly
true
when
we
deal
with
consensual
crimes,
crimes
such
as
gambling,
narcotics,
bribery,
jury
tampering.
now,
unlike
crimes
of
violence,
these
consensual
crimes
do
not
have
individual
victims.
the
only
victim
of
this
sort
of
crime
is
the
body
politic.
you
don't
find
a
successful
jury
fixer
nor
do
you
find
a
juryman
who
sold
his
vote
coming
into
complaint.
this
sort
of
crime,
consensual
crime,
victimless
crime
if
you
will
is
not
just
difficult
to
prove.
it's
often
difficult
to
discover.
unfortunately,
these
victimless
crimes
are
those
which
i
feel
most
perniciously
corrode
our
society.
as
co-counsel
on
the
brief
i
have
with
me
mr.
lewin
who
argued
the
portion
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
request
ten
minutes
for
mr.
lewin
i
believe
that's
within
the
time
of
the
government.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutional
propriety
of
conviction
of
four
petitioners
charged
with
violating
the
obstruction
of
justice
statute
by
jury
tampering.
the
jury
tampering
activities
disclosed
by
the
record
occurred
at
a
trial
at
which
defendant
hoffa
was
the
only
defendant.
this
case
and
others
set
immediately
preceding
and
immediately
following
have
very
broad
implications
bearing
upon
the
use
by
law
enforcement
of
an
investigative
technique,
law
enforcements
has
always
found
to
be
important
at
the
use
of
informants.
before
summarizing
the
facts,
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
limited
order
of
the
court
in
granting
certiorari.
in
doing
this
of
course,
the
court
acted
in
accordance
with
its
practice
and
phrased
the
question
as
presented
by
petitioner.
there
the
question
referred
to
the
government's
deceptively
placing
a
secret
informer
with
defendant.
the
government's
position
amply
borne
out
in
the
record
and
by
the
court's
findings
is
simply
that
it
did
not
place
the
informant
anywhere
deceptively
or
otherwise.
i
would
also
at
this
point
like
to
clear
up
several
matters
that
counsel
referred
to
concessions
made
by
the
government.
the
government
does
not
concede
that
even
if
the
facts
proved
as
the
question
is
posed
were
true
that
petitioners
would
prevail
in
this
cause.
secondly,
in
response
to
questions
from
justices
harlan
and
stewart
earlier
this
morning,
counsel
for
petitioners
seems
to
state
that
the
government
had
conceded
that
there
had
been
an
illegal
entry
in
this
case.
there
has
been
no
such
concession.
in
addition,
on
page
9
of
petitioner's
reply
brief,
there's
another
concession
improperly
made
or
improperly
attributed
to
the
government.
the
reply
brief
says
that
the
government
explicitly
admits
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
violated
by
the
government's
very
presence
in
the
protected
counsels
of
the
petitioners.
the
government
makes
no
such
concession.
the
facts
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
think
the
facts
indicate
the
contrary
and
we
do
argue
the
legal
point
of
the
contrary,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
the
facts
in
the
case
can
best
be
understood
when
they
are
broken
down
into
two
parts.
the
occurrences
which
preceded
the
nashville
trial,
that's
the
trial
at
the
test
fleet
case
where
the
jury
tampering
took
place
and
secondly
the
occurrences
during
that
trial
which
led
to
the
charges
in
the
chattanooga
case
which
is
before
the
court.
now,
you've
heard
many
inferences
drawn
by
able
counsel
for
the
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
facts.
i
think
in
connection
with
the
facts
it
would
be
helpful
to
start
off
on
page
58
of
the
government's
brief
with
the
trial
court's
findings.
now,
these
were
findings
that
the
conclusion
of
the
initial
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
partin's
testimony.
the
court
said
that
it
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
motion
to
suppress
should
be
overruled
having
observed
the
manner
and
demeanor
of
the
witness
on
the
witness
stand
and
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
i
would
find
that
there
has
been
interference
with
the
government
with
any
attorney-client
relationship
of
any
defendant
in
this
case.
i
would
further
find
that
the
government
did
not
place
this
witness
mr.
partin
in
the
defendant's
midst
or
have
anything
to
do
with
placing
him
in
their
midst
rather
that
he
was
knowingly
and
voluntarily
placed
in
their
midst
by
one
of
the
defendants.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
did
not
mr.
justice.
however,
he
amplified
these
findings
in
denying
motions
for
a
new
trial
when
the
whole
panoply
of
evidence
was
in.
he
felt
necessary
to
do
this
in
light
of
the
petitioner's
contentions
that
evidence
subsequently
introduced,
introduced
after
the
motion
to
suppress
affected
these
findings.
now,
in
answer
to
this,
the
trial
judge
stated
that
the
additional
evidence
in
no
way
altered
the
court's
finding
that
the
government
did
not
place
or
keep
partin
with
the
defendant
hoffa
nor
does
it
relate
to
or
alter
the
court's
finding
that
there
was
no
illegal
interference
with
defendant
hoffa's
right
to
counsel.
now,
in
this
memorandum,
the
denial
of
the
new
trial
where
the
previous
findings
were
amplified,
a
court
further
found
one,
that
partin
remained
in
nashville
or
returned
to
nashville
either
at
the
request
of
or
with
the
consent
of
defendant
hoffa
and
not
at
the
instruction
of
the
government.
secondly,
that
the
government
requested
of
partin
only
that
he
report
information
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activity
of
which
he
became
aware.
and
third
that
partin
furnished
such
information.
now,
these
findings
are
amply
supported
by
the
record.
but
finally
the
court
held
that
the
presence
of
partin
during
the
course
of
the
nashville
trial,
the
test
fleet
trial
and
the
reporting
of
information
by
him
at
that
time
did
not
in
any
way
relate
to
the
rights
of
the
defendants,
the
petitioners
here
in
the
preparation
and
trial
of
the
chattanooga
case.
now,
in
the
face
of
these
findings
i
don't
think
the
inferences
that
either
counsel
for
the
petitioner
or
counsel
for
the
government
to
draw
or
particularly
important.
however,
in
view
of
the
due
process
argument
i
think
its
incumbent
on
the
government
to
respond
to
--
certain
of
the
inferences
drawn
to
the
facts.
now,
in
1962
the
time
of
the
national
test
fleet
trial,
edward
partin
as
we've
heard
was
an
official
of
local
no.
5
of
the
teamsters
union
in
baton
rouge,
louisiana.
since
1957
he
had
been
a
close
associate
of
petitioner
hoffa.
it's
true
that
in
late
september
1962
partin
was
in
a
state
jail
in
louisiana
on
a
kidnapping
charge.
this
charge
arose
from
a
family
dispute
in
which
partin
assisted
his
best
friend,
a
father
in
taking
his
children
away
from
his
estranged
wife
and
kidnapping
in
louisiana
is
an
unbailable
offense
until
the
victim
is
returned
unharmed.
at
that
time,
the
children
had
not
been
returned.
at
the
same
time
partin
was
on
bail
on
a
federal
charge,
a
violation
of
labor
management
purporting
in
disclosure
act.
now,
still
in
late
september,
partin
met
twice
with
state
prosecutors
on
successive
days.
at
these
meetings
as
counsel
has
stated,
he
related
to
these
state
officials
an
alleged
plan
by
petitioner
hoffa
to
murder
robert
kennedy
who
was
then
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
the
local
officials
reported
this
matter
to
the
fbi
and
at
their
suggestion
he
reported
on
to
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
new
orleans.
the
assistant
then
called
frank
grimsley
whom
you've
already
heard,
a
department
of
justice
attorney
who
in
turn
called
walter
sheridan.
now,
the
substance
of
these
calls
was
and
this
is
the
first
contact
of
the
federal
establishment
with
this
man
and
this
context.
the
substance
of
these
calls
was
that
partin
wished
to
speak
to
a
representative
of
the
department
about
a
gray
matter
involving
security.
now
there
resulted
two
meetings
to
between
partin
and
two
state
officials
and
two
federal
officials.
at
the
first
of
these
on
october
2
or
october
3,
the
record
is
not
clear,
partin
repeated
his
allegation
about
this
alleged
plan
to
murder
the
attorney
general.
the
testimony
is
that
if
hoffa's
impending
national
trial
was
mentioned
at
all,
it
was
by
way
of
a
casual
remark.
several
days
later,
a
second
meeting
took
place
between
the
same
people
except
for
one
state
official
who
was
missing
and
it
was
not
clear
what
was
discussed
at
this
meeting.
the
record
is
silent.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
was
present
however
testified
that
he
--
as
to
this
meeting
he
couldn't
recall
whether
hoffa's
name
came
up
at
all.
it's
also
not
clear
whether
partin
was
in
jail
at
this
time
because
by
then
the
children
had
been
returned
to
their
mother
and
the
offense
then
became
bailable.
now
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
an
attorney
on
the
criminal
division
of
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
at
a
headquartered
generally
in
atlanta.
i
understand
as
his
primary
responsibility
was
in
that
southeastern
area,
new
orleans,
georgia.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no
sir.
he
may
have
spent
a
substantial
amount
of
time
here
but
he's
also
i
think
it
could
fairly
be
said
to
be
headquartered
in
atlanta.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
understand
that
he
handled
generally
organized
crime
and
labor
racketeering
matters.
now,
in
the
meantime,
it's
now
been
several
days
since
news
of
--
was
given
to
the
federal
establishment
about
an
alleged
murder
attempt
or
plan.
the
fbi
was
conducting
an
investigation.
this
investigation
included
examinations
of
partin
by
polygraph
and
the
polygraph
expert
concluded
that
the
test
lent
support
to
partin's
allegation.
now,
at
about
this
same
point
in
time,
one
difficulty
with
the
facts
here
as
if
we
have
a
months
period
of
time
when
there
is
a
whole
lot
churning
and
a
lot
of
happening
and
a
lot
separate
interests
coalescing
but
about
this
same
point
in
time
october
6,
partin's
federal
bond
was
cancelled
by
a
bonding
company.
this
was
a
$50,000.00
bond
and
partin
had
to
go
to
local
friends
to
help
him
put
up
a
new
bond.
now,
the
bonding
company
which
canceled
was
a
business
interest
of
allen
dorfman
who
was
a
close
associate
and
friend
of
petitioner
hoffa's
and
later
he
was
a
codefendant
in
the
chattanooga
trial.
he
was
acquitted.
now,
hoffa
had
helped
get
this
bond
from
dorfman
so
partin
suspected
that
petitioner
hoffa
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
cancellation
and
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
it
and
find
out
really
if
and
why.
now,
also
about
this
time
around
october
6,
1962,
a
state
official
and
partin
moved
into
a
motel
in
baton
rouge.
this
--
there
was
some
testimony
to
the
effect
that
this
was
for
the
purpose
of
corroborating
information
that
partin
had
been
reporting
to
him,
the
state
official,
the
state
district
attorney
since
late
september
and
in
this
connection
for
this
purpose
the
state
district
attorney
testified
that
he
instructed
partin
in
the
use
of
a
recording
device
and
that
partin
recorded
between
80
and
a
hundred
telephone
calls
in
this
four
day
period
and
in
a
subsequent
three
day
period
now
only
two
of
these
recorded
calls
were
with
petitioner
hoffa.
and
the
defense
introduced
the
transcripts
of
those
calls
into
evidence.
now,
this
recording
equipment
of
course
belonged
to
the
state
and
the
state
officer
was
acting
in
his
capacity
as
a
state
officer.
testimony
is
clear
that
he
hadn't
been
asked
to
pursue
this
investigation
by
the
federal
government.
now,
in
between
the
two
recorded
calls
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear
with
respect
to
the
state
interest
involved.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no,
between
80
and
100
in
a
seven-day
period.
four
days
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
all
the
calls
weren't
record.
there
were
--
there
was
a
--
there
were
a
substantial
number
of
other
calls
but
this
number
was
recorded.
there
is
testimony
to
that
effect.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
they
were
--
the
ones
to
petitioner
hoffa
were
long
distance
but
in
the
quantity
of
these
calls,
they
were
both
incumbent.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
they
--
the
testimony
is
clear
in
this
respect
there
was
an
induction
device
which
was
placed
on
the
outside
of
the
telephone
instrument
and
of
course
partin
did
the
placing
and
partin
was
the
operator
of
the
telephone
call,
so
i
don't
think
that
for
purposes
of
section
605,
that
would
be
a
wiretap
but
in
any
event
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
because
the
defendant
introduced
them
into
evidence.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
partin,
his
--
certainly
as
to
his
side
the
conversation
because
he
fixed
the
device
to
the
telephone.
but
in
any
event
the
--
mr.
grimsley,
the
department
of
justice
attorney
testified
that
he
had
nothing
with
the
recordings
and
he
did
not
know
what
the
louisiana
state
officials
and
partin's
real
purpose
was
in
making
this
vast
amount
of
calls.
the
record
is
also
not
clear
as
to
when
the
federal
government
received
knowledge
of
the
specifics
of
these
calls
or
copies
of
the
recordings
but
the
government
was
certainly
advised
of
their
general
content,
well
at
least
of
the
general
contents
of
the
last
call,
the
october
18th
call
on
that
same
day
which
was
four
days
before
the
nashville
trial
commenced.
now,
following
this
last
recorded
call,
the
transcript
of
which
is
in
evidence,
this
is
the
call
of
petitioner
hoffa
on
one
hand
and
partin
on
the
other
hand,
both
the
state
officials
who
was
involved
and
partin
told
mr.
grimsley,
the
department
attorney
that
hoffa
had
invited
partin
to
nashville
and
grimsley
so
understood
it.
grimsley
then
reported
the
gist
of
this
conversation
to
mr.
sheridan
and
mr.
sheridan
in
turn
told
grimsley
to
ask
partin
to
call
sheridan
in
nashville
if
he
saw
any
evidence
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activity.
it
was
his
18th
call
at
which
the
plans
between
mr.
hoffa
and
mr.
partin
were
finalized
as
to
when
they
would
get
together.
now,
this
request
to
partin
was
conveyed
to
him
by
grimsley
at
a
meeting
in
atlanta
on
october
20
were
two
days
before
the
trial.
this
conversation
or
this
meeting
concerned
many
matters
other
than
the
nashville
trial.
the
testimony
is
that
during
the
major
part
of
the
meeting
other
things
were
discussed,
but
eventually
the
conversation
turned
to
the
--
to
partin
going
to
nashville
and
grimsley
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
comply
with
hoffa's
request,
that
partin
meeting.
after
partin
said
that
he
did
plan
to
meet
the
petitioner
hoffa,
grimsley
asked
him
to
keep
his
eyes
and
ears
open
and
should
he
observe
any
evidence
of
jury
tampering
or
other
illegal
activity
to
report
it
to
mr.
sheridan
in
nashville.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
record
is
not
at
all
adequate
in
this
respect
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
be
the
last
to
deny
that
the
federal
government
after
the
information
that
had
been
given
to
it
by
partin
that
information
to
go
back
was
the
plan
to
murder
a
member
of
the
cabinet
and
i
believe
counsel
adverted
this
morning
to
another
matter,
the
bribery
of
an
nlrb
official.
with
that
information
in
hand,
the
government
was
naturally
interested
in
mr.
partin
getting
any
further
information
in
that
regard
that
he
could.
the
government
didn't
care
whether
the
meeting
was
in
new
jersey,
washington
or
nashville.
this
is
what
i
referred
to
previously
as
everything
happened
here
within
a
months
period.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
in
jail
mr.
justice
on
a
non-bailable
offense,
kidnapping.
under
louisiana
law
however
if
the
victim
in
this
case,
the
child
of
a
friend
of
his
was
--
is
returned
unharmed
it
becomes
a
bailable
offense.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
following
the
return
of
the
children
a
bail
was
fixed
at
i
believe
$5000
or
$6000
for
that
offense.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
he
did.
and
the
charge
was
later
dismissed
because
the
mother
refused
to
testify
against
her
husband
and
the
charges
were
invalid.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct.
he'd
always
been
out
on
the
federal
offense.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
they
got
five
or
six
local
friends
to
put
up
the
bond
for
him.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
there
were
several
other
charges
the
--
there
was
something
said
about
an
automobile
accident
in
alabama
which
may
have
been
involved
a
manslaughter
charge.
there
was
also
something
said
about
--
there
was
also
something
said
about
a
charge
for
battery
and
perjury.
however,
the
record
is
clear
that
this
occurred
after
the
nashville
trial
sometime
in
1963
and
he
was
acquitted
of
the
battery
charge
and
the
perjury
charge
which
grew
out
of
the
battery
charge
was
null.
that's
a
state
charge.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
federal
charge
in
my
recollection
is
--
was
the
spring
or
early
summer
of
1962.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
what
was
the
precise
date
of
the
embezzlement
indictment?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
federal
charge
is
still
pending.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
might
add
in
connection
with
that
mr.
justice
that
the
federal
indictment
was
returned
june
22,
1962,
period
of
time
where
you're
concerned
with
this
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
is
october
of
1962.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
it
was
a
26
count
indictment
i
believe
went
back
in
1961
mr.
chief
justice.
as
mr.
justice
black
points
out
the
indictment
has
been
pending
for
four
years.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
record
of
course
was
not
too
long
after
the
charge
was
brought.
i
can
--
i
plan
actually
to
review
this
matter
after
this
case
is
disposed
of
by
the
supreme
court.
we
have
--
i
personally
felt
that
if
the
department
of
justice
under
attack
because
of
this
indictment
either
dismiss
or
proceeded
that
we
would
be
--
we
were
on
the
horns
of
the
dilemma.
the
--
i
intend
to
have
an
independent
review
made
of
the
matter
and
will
dispose
of
it
in
accordance
with
that.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
can
in
no
way
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
can
in
no
way
take
that
position.
however,
petitioners
make
a
broad
due
process
argument
that
really
relates
to
the
inherent
fairness
of
the
government's
conduct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
certainly
an
informant
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
--
of
the
government.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
his
information
was
used
by
the
government.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
i
know
how
you
define
that
term
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
mean
was
he
on
the
payroll?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
was
an
undercover
agent,
no.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
not
compensated
at
all.
the
$1200
which
was
paid
him,
this
is
something
that
i
plan
to
get
into,
the
$1200
that
was
paid
him
following
the
nashville
trial
was
compensation
for
expenses
both
travel
and
per
diem
in
the
period
between
the
nashville
and
the
chattanooga
trial
in
assisting
the
government
to
prepare
for
trial.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no,
the
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
in
candor,
the
accounting
was
not
too
good.
the
--
a
piece
of
paper
was
introduced
showing
the
trips
he
had
made
and
the
airfare,
the
amount
of
time
he
had
spent
in
the
per
diem
and
it
was
added
up
and
it
came
to
some
1500
and
i
believe
23
some
$300
plus
more
than
was
paid
him
through
mrs.
partin.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
he
was
obligated
to
pay
her
$300
a
month
support
for
her
and
some
children.
he
asked
that
it
be
paid
in
this
manner
because
he
said
i
can
--
i
believe
his
words
were,
i
can
take
care
of
myself.
you
pay
it
this
way.
also,
i
might
add
that
there
was
a
security
aspect
in
making
the
payments
in
indirect
manner.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
felt
that
it
would
better
if
the
--
if
those
involved
did
not
know
at
that
time
that
he
was
an
informer
for
the
government.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
they
were
made
to
her
in
installments
of
either
$300
or
$150
over
a
period
of
a
few
months
commencing
in
july
1963.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
for
the
short
period
of
time.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
when
the
payments
were
commenced
it
was
recognized
that
there
as
money
owing
for
reimbursed
expenses
and
travel
and
it
was
commenced
and
$1200
was
paid,
a
total
and
according
to
these
figures,
the
government
still
owes
mr.
partin
some
$300.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
don't
know
why
they
stopped
the
$1200
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no,
it
did
not
mr.
justice.
that
was
justice
black's
question
this
morning
which
counsel
for
the
petitioner
referred
to
immediately
after
the
noon
recess.
the
union
local
no.
5
had
paid
for
mr.
partin's
expenses
in
connection
with
those
11
trips.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no
sir,
we
think
not.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
legally?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct
sir
except
for
the
due
process
argument.
now,
as
to
--
we
no
have
--
we
now
have
mr.
partin
arriving
in
nashville
on
october
22nd.
now
some
may
have
the
impression
that
the
accommodations
of
petitioner
hoffa
were
for
a
tight
knit
so-called
defense
camp
of
lawyers
and
the
defendant.
such
--
just
is
not
the
case.
petitioner
hoffa's
own
testimony
and
that
of
his
associates
makes
it
clear
that
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
union
officials,
acquaintances,
friends
and
associates
through
these
quarters.
there's
testimony
that
reference
has
been
made
to
partin
eating
with
lawyers.
well,
there's
testimony
that
people
often
ate
in
groups
of
ten,
15
or
20.
on
page
118
of
volume
i
of
the
record,
there
is
a
picture
of
petitioner
hoffa
and
11
of
his
friends
and
associates
leaving
the
hotel
in
nashville
during
the
trial
and
only
two
of
those
in
the
picture
are
attorneys.
now,
when
mr.
partin
of
petitioner
hoffa's.
with
him
was
a
man
who
introduced
himself
as
arthur
--
as
anthony
quinn.
now,
this
anthony
quinn
later
that
day
reintroduced
himself
by
his
correct
name
twill
and
this
is
according
to
partin
and
said
that
mr.
dorfman
had
ask
him,
twill,
to
come
to
nashville
and
help
him
get
to
the
jury.
twill
in
his
testimony
admitted
to
a
conversation
with
partin
but
he
denied
the
balance
of
partin's
testimony
in
this
regard.
in
connection
with
this
first
day,
partin
also
testified
that
hoffa
said,
petitioner
hoffa
said
that
twill
was
in
nashville
to
help
him.
now,
also
on
october
22nd,
the
first
day,
petitioner
king
told
partin
that
there
was
a
meeting
on
the
jury
that
night.
later
that
evening,
partin
testified
that
petitioner
hoffa
told
him
"that
they
was
get
to
one
juror
or
try
to
get
to
a
few
scattered
jurors
and
take
their
chances."
now,
partin
that
afternoon
or
evening
called
sheridan
to
report
all
or
some
of
the
above
occurrences
relating
to
jury
tampering
and
later
that
day,
october
22nd
met
with
him
personally.
the
next
day,
october
23rd,
before
partin
left
nashville
petitioner
hoffa
told
him
that
he,
hoffa
might
want
partin
to
pass
something
for
him
when
partin
return.
now,
as
on
the
side
here,
i
should
say
that
partin's
testimony
with
respect
to
particular
conversations
with
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
and
with
defendants
below
dorfman
and
twill
were
denied
by
them
at
trial
but
this
also
points
out
the
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
were
denied
by
these
individuals
at
trial.
but
this
also
points
out
the
discrimination
displayed
by
the
chattanooga
jury
for
there
was
a
substantial
approved
aside
from
partin
that
these
petitioners
made
efforts
to
get
a
jurors
pascual
and
fields
and
there
was
less
proof
as
to
the
involvement
of
defendants
dorfman
and
twill
who
were
acquitted
along
with
petitioner
hoffa
on
count
four
of
the
indictment.
now,
the
details
of
proof
as
to
the
actual
efforts
to
reach
jurors
are
spelled
out
in
detail
in
the
brief.
i
think
there's
no
need
to
go
into
that.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
i
have
two
references
to
that,
volume
2
r,
page
261
and
volume
3
r,
page
819.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
now
during
the
remaining
22
days
approximately
that
partin
was
in
nashville
during
the
trial
both
petitioners
hoffa
and
petitioner
king
made
a
number
of
statements
relating
to
jury
tampering,
incriminating
statements
to
partin.
or
hoffa
berated
petitioner
king
in
--
about
his
inefficiency
in
this
jury
tampering
efforts
and
this
was
in
hoffa's
--
this
was
in
partin's
presence.
counsel
for
petitioners
made
much
of
the
fact
in
his
fourth
amendment
argument
that
this
was
a
different
sort
of
overhearing.
this
wasn't
a
face
to
face
conversation
which
the
auditor
was
intended
to
hear
but
the
record
in
this
regard
makes
clear
that
partin
was
on
the
scene,
was
known
to
be
on
the
scene
and
was
intended
that
he
overhear
this
conversation
so
that
no
real
distinction
in
that
respect.
the
statements
that
were
told
to
partin
or
that
were
made
in
his
known
presence
included
one
that
petitioner
hoffa
made
with
respect
to
having
the
male
negro
juror
in
his
hip
pocket.
these
statements
as
to
jury
tampering
were
all
passed
on
to
mr.
sheridan
by
partin
either
personally
or
by
phone.
with
respect
to
the
statement
as
to
this
particular
juror
fields
was
the
only
male
negro
on
the
jury.
now,
there's
no
dispute
that
partin
call
sheridan
or
met
with
him
often
perhaps
daily
when
in
nashville
during
the
trial.
these
reports
were
all
oral.
mr.
sheridan
received
partin's
reports
without
comment.
he
never
gave
partin
instructions
as
to
what
to
do
or
not
to
do.
he
didn't
ask
him
to
stay
in
nashville.
now,
when
information
as
to
the
jury
tampering
was
received
by
sheridan,
he
would
turn
it
over
to
the
fbi.
the
fbi
would
then
investigate
and
seek
to
corroborate
it.
when
the
investigation
eventually
or
eventuated
into
a
great
substance
corroboration
of
the
partin
reports,
remedial
steps
were
taken
by
advising
the
court.
this
led
in
december
of
the
trial
first
to
the
disqualification
of
juror
pascual
and
then
to
the
disqualification
of
juror
fields.
we've
already
discussed
the
matter
of
payment
and
the
confusion
about
payment
in
the
record.
the
record
that
probably
is
the
most
contradictory
with
respect
to
partin's
access
to
the
quarters
and
counsels
of
the
defense.
petitioner
hoffa
had
five
attorneys
of
record
during
the
trial
and
three
other
attorneys
were
with
him
during
part
or
all
of
the
trial.
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
throngs
of
non-lawyers
who
were
passing
through
and
in
and
out
of
these
premises.
partin
testified
that
he
was
in
and
around
petitioner
hoffa's
suite
and
for
a
period
of
time,
he
did
act
as
doorman.
he
also
testified
that
he
frequently
saw
and
occasionally
conferred
with
petitioner
hoffa's
attorneys.
in
essence,
his
testimony
was
that
he
made
no
effort
to
be
present
at
conversations
involving
attorneys.
he
might
have
been
but
he
did
not
know
what
they
were
talking
about.
he's
a
man
with
a
tenth
grade
education.
he
stated
that
the
attorneys
would
move
you
out
as
he
expressed
it
when
they
were
discussing
the
case
and
he
didn't
think
that
he
ever
reported
anything
told
him
by
an
attorney
because
sheridan
wasn't
interested
in
that.
now,
sheridan's
testimony
with
one
exception
is
not
to
the
contrary.
sheridan
testified
that
partin
passed
on
to
him
information
as
to
the
comings
and
goings
of
people,
jury
tampering
efforts,
happenings
that
were
perhaps
illegal,
certainly
unethical
and
a
very
few
comments
generally
related
to
the
trial.
at
no
time
did
sheridan
receive
any
documents
or
any
copies
of
documents
from
partin.
now,
i
refer
to
one
exception,
the
counsel
referred
to
as
this
morning.
this
was
--
this
exception
concern
an
oral
report
by
partin
that
sheridan
understood
to
mean
a
lawyer
was
writing
out
questions
and
answers
for
a
group
of
witnesses
to
memorize.
partin
did
not
convey
to
sheridan
the
questions
and
answers
themselves
but
merely
the
fact
that
there
were
questions
and
answers.
now,
the
defense
testimony
which
in
regard
to
access,
you
heard
summarized
in
part
this
morning,
it
contains
a
number
of
internal
inconsistencies
as
to
the
degree
of
partin's
presence
and
his
participation.
but
actually
petitioner
hoffa's
own
testimony
which
is
found
at
volume
iv
of
the
record
at
page
1396
gives
the
impression
that
i
could
characterize
a
testimony
as
giving
the
impression
that
he
saw
partin
very
little
during
the
trial.
he
was
busy
and
he
didn't
find
time
to
sit
down
with
him
to
talk
about
the
union
business
until
late
in
the
trial.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,

the
testimony?
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
or
didn't
see
him
much
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
--
around
the
headquarter
suite
during
the
trial.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
in
any
event,
that's
what
he
did
testify,
mr.
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
now,
before
turning
to
our
legal
argument,
i
would
just
touch
upon
one
matter
i've
already
briefly
alluded
to
and
that's
the
government's
reasonable
apprehension
before
the
nashville
trial
that
there
would
be
efforts
to
reach
the
jury
in
nashville.
this
apprehension
proved
to
be
fully
justified.
now,
on
the
first
morning
of
the
trial
at
about
or
just
before
mr.
partin
arrived,
a
prospective
juror
reported
to
the
court
an
improper
phone
call
from
someone
posing
as
a
newspaper
reporter.
two
more
such
calls
were
received
--
well,
two
more
of
such
reports
from
jurors
were
made
the
following
day.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
october
22nd
was
the
first
report,
first
day
of
trial.
partin's
report
of
course
on
the
afternoon
or
evening
of
october
22nd
when
he
had
just
arrived
in
town
confirmed
these
fears
and
on
october
24,
this
is
the
third
day
of
trial
and
it
was
before
the
jury
was
actually
sworn,
james
tippens
who
had
been
tentatively
ceded
as
a
juror
on
the
preceding
day
reported
to
the
court
that
a
neighbor
had
offered
him
$10,000
in
$100
bills
in
connection
with
his
prospective
service
at
the
trial.
now,
the
court
advised
petitioner
hoffa
and
counsel
for
both
sides
in
the
nashville
trial
of
this
report
and
excused
tippens
from
the
jury.
mr.
partin
testified
that
when
he
returned
to
nashville
on
the
25th
that
petitioner
hoffa
related
this
instant
to
him
and
commented
that
we're
going
to
have
to
lie
low
a
few
days.
so
at
this
very
early
stage
in
the
proceeding
it
was
quite
apparent
to
the
government
that
a
large
scale
attack
on
the
integrity
of
this
jury
in
this
trial
was
well
under
way.
the
activities
of
this
nature
ultimately
culminated
with
12
defendants
charge
with
nine
separate
endeavors
to
obstruct
and
in
six
persons
convicted,
four
of
which
--
four
of
these
convictions
are
before
the
court
in
this
case.
and
of
course
the
case
immediately
preceding
this,
the
osborne
cases
involved
a
similar
charge
in
the
succeeding
chattanooga
case.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
medland
was
--
mr.
medland
was
convicted
and
you
denied
cert
i
believe
was
in
recent
days.
and
bell
was
the
other
gentleman
which
cert
was
denied
there
also.
now,
i
should
make
clear
that
the
government's
position
and
the
government's
basic
arguments
don't
depend
on
the
practical
necessities
of
this
case.
this
is
what
the
government
was
confronted
with
and
had
to
deal
with
from
the
first
day
of
the
trial
but
our
basic
arguments
don't
depend
on
those
practical
necessities.
but
we
do
ask
the
court
to
consider
these
exigencies
in
connection
with
the
basic
question
of
fairness
presented.
now,
this
leads
me
into
a
discussion
of
the
sixth
amendment
argument
raised
by
petitioners.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
our
legal
position
would
be
the
same,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
the
legal
issue
upon
which
certiorari
has
been
granted
concerns
the
admissibility
in
chattanooga
of
the
evidence
obtained
by
the
government
from
partin
during
the
nashville
test
fleet
case.
more
precisely
the
issues
whether
partin's
testimony
with
respect
to
jury
tampering
efforts
should
have
been
excluded
at
the
chattanooga
trial
as
having
been
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth,
fifth
or
sixth
amendment.
now,
the
context
however
for
determining
this
question
is
the
chattanooga
jury
fixing
case
and
not
the
nashville
test
fleet
case.
it's
very
important
at
the
outset
of
the
sixth
amendment
argument
to
note
that
partin's
challenged
testimony
dealt
with
statements
made
to
him
by
petitioners
hoffa
and
king
concerning
current
or
future
endeavors
to
corrupt
the
nashville
jury.
the
sixth
amendment
certainly
does
not
make
privilege
every
statement
made
by
defendant
on
trial.
it
does
not
cloak
with
privilege
statements
made
concerning
criminal
offenses
which
are
planned
or
committed
during
trial.
if
a
defendant
tells
his
lawyer
that
he's
going
to
bribe
a
juror,
the
attorney
has
an
obligation
to
attempt
to
dissuade
his
client.
he
also
has
an
obligation
to
report
the
plan
of
felony
to
the
authorities.
the
law
is
clear
in
this
area,
the
clark
case
dicta
in
the
supreme
court,
in
in
re
sawyer,
seventh
circuit
case
and
many
others.
now,
an
informant
is
as
least
--
an
informant
is
at
least
as
free
to
report
and
testify
to
such
disclosures
as
the
attorney
of
the
person
who
makes
the
disclosures.
thus,
we
feel
that
the
short
answer
to
the
sixth
amendment
issue
is
that
petitioner
hoffa
and
petitioner
king's
remarks
as
to
which
partin
testified
were
clearly
unprivileged.
now,
with
further
reference
and
still
on
the
sixth
amendment
point
it's
important
to
note
that
the
issue
in
the
case
is
still
not
the
constitutional
standards
relating
to
the
nashville
trial
but
the
admissibility
of
evidence
at
the
chattanooga
trial.
now,
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
no
interference
with
sixth
amendment
rights
at
the
chattanooga
trial,
the
second
trial.
they
reasoned
and
we
argue
that
it's
not
necessary
any
fruit
of
the
poisoned
tree
argument
because
there
just
was
no
unlawful
invasion
by
the
government
of
defendant's
right
to
counsel
in
the
nashville
test
fleet
case.
but
in
any
event
as
i
will
develop
more
fully
in
a
moment,
the
partin's
testimony
was
not
in
any
sense
the
fruit
of
alleged
governmental
wrongdoing.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
they
take
the
position
that
the
entry
was
illegal.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
do
not
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
do
not
agree
with
that
position.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
--
the
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
and
we
take
the
position
that
one
who
is
told
by
petitioner
hoffa
that
he
is
committing
an
ongoing
criminal
act
has
the
right
and
indeed
a
duty
to
report
that
to
the
authorities.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
we
think
not
mr.
justice.
the
--
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
petitioners
advanced
the
fruit
of
the
wrongdoing
contention.
in
other
words
that
partin's
testimony,
the
facts
he
elicited
and
testified
to
were
the
fruits
of
his
wrongdoing
in
violating
sixth
amendment
rights.
we
feel
that
the
court
need
not
reach
this
argument
if
it
finds
there
was
no
violation
of
sixth
amendment
rights
at
nashville.
but
even
if
this
court
should
be
of
a
contrary
view,
that
conclusion
would
not
justify
reversal
of
these
convictions.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
would
consider
it.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
would
consider
it
improper
and
illegal
on
either
side
of
the
fence.
however,
i
would
not
consider
the
reporting
of
a
statement
made
as
to
ongoing
criminality
to
be
in
any
way
connected
with
the
sixth
amendment
rights
involved.
the
question
you
posed
with
respect
to
obstruction
of
justice
on
one
hand
and
the
sixth
amendment
violation
on
the
other
hand
really
illustrates
the
--
one
of
the
ironies
in
this
case
because
here
in
our
view
the
petitioners
seek
to
expand
the
umbrella
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
passes
a
very
basic
purpose,
the
protection
of
the
adversary
system
and
at
the
same
time
it's
charged
with
violations
of
section
1503,
the
statute
which
has
the
same
general
purposes.
but
getting
back
to
the
fruit
argument,
i
believe
that
in
this
court
the
petitioners
have
changed
the
thrust
of
their
argument
a
bit.
below,
they
argued
the
fruit
of
the
wrongdoing.
here
they
appear
to
take
the
position
that
it's
not
a
fruit
problem
but
rather
this
is
the
poisoned
tree
itself.
but
in
order
to
examine
this
issue
in
either
context.
we
first
should
recall
that
the
issue
is
the
admissibility
of
evidence
in
the
chattanooga
trial,
the
second
trial.
now,
the
alleged
wrongdoing
is
intrusion
by
the
government
upon
the
right
of
counsel
and
defendant's
right
and
counsel's
right
to
prepare
for
trial,
right
--
rights
which
are
protected
by
the
sixth
amendment.
with
regard
to
the
chattanooga
trial,
the
question
is
whether
any
alleged
infringement
of
petitioner's
rights
in
nashville
requires
the
exclusion
of
partin's
testimony
as
to
jury
tampering
efforts.
the
test
set
up
by
this
court
in
wong
sun,
the
test
for
determining
causal
connection
is
helpful
in
this
regard.
the
court
said
that
the
question
is
whether
granting
primary
illegality
the
evidence
has
been
come
at
by
exploitation
of
that
illegality.
now,
for
applying
this
test,
we
must
assume
arguendo
that
there
was
a
violation
of
sixth
amendment
rights.
it's
this
violation
the
alleged
communication
of
defense
strategy
which
we
feel
would
constitute
the
primary
illegality
under
the
wong
sun
test.
the
unprivileged
statements
regarding
jury
tampering
and
thus
partin's
testimony
was
not
--
come
at
in
any
sense
of
the
word
by
exploitation
of
that
illegality.
now,
here
partin
did
not
obtain
evidence
with
respect
to
jury
tampering
as
a
consequence
of
any
knowledge
that
he
gained
during
the
course
of
attorneys'
conferences
or
otherwise
related
to
the
operation
of
the
defense.
here
no
statement
petitioner
hoffa's,
no
statement
of
petitioner
king's
which
was
testified
to
by
partin
had
any
possible
relationship
to
any
legitimate
aspect
of
the
nashville
defense.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
that
question
of
course
--
that
question
is
--
would
be
--
if
we
were
here
talking
about
the
constitutional
propriety
of
the
nashville
trial
as
to
whether
the
defendant
--
the
defendant's
secret
information
had
been
fed
to
the
government.
if
that
were
the
fact,
i
would
agree
that
the
nashville
trial
would
fall
short
of
constitutional
standards.
but
here,
we
are
talking
about
the
chattanooga
trial
months
hence
at
which
partin
testified
to
the
jury
tampering
efforts
during
the
nashville
trial.
the
--
another
approach
to
the
sixth
amendment
problem
is
of
course
to
say
that
this
is
analogous
to
the
argument
we've
previously
made
as
to
say
that
the
sixth
amendment
defines
a
relationship.
it
doesn't
define
the
defense
camp
as
such.
it's
the
relationship
between
the
attorney
and
his
client,
their
right
to
prepare
for
trial.
now,
heartening
back
to
wong
sun,
the
court
held
that
wong
sun's
confession
made
after
his
illegal
arrest
was
not
the
fruit
of
the
government's
wrongdoing
because
following
his
release,
he
returned
voluntarily
several
days
later
to
make
his
statement.
now,
the
court's
holding
was
that
the
causal
connection
between
the
arrest
and
the
statement
was
so
attenuated
that
the
taint
was
dissipated.
there
was
a
connection
where
it
was
tenuous.
in
this
case,
we
urge
that
the
relationship
between
whatever
access
partin
had
to
defense
strategy
in
the
nashville
case
and
the
incriminating
statements
privately
made
to
him
is
far
more
tenuous
there
completely
unrelated
to
any
testimony
of
partin
in
chattanooga
bears
no
relationship
to
any
legitimate
aspect
of
the
defense
of
the
nashville
trial.
the
main
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
in
this
court
would
appear
to
be
the
fourth
amendment.
in
osborne
argued
immediately
preceding
these
cases,
the
fourth
amendment
was
adverted
to.
in
lewis,
the
case
immediately
following
the
fourth
amendment
is
virtually
the
only
issue.
as
the
fourth
amendment
issues
in
this
case,
in
lewis
particularly
are
so
closely
allied,
i
will
limit
my
argument
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment
to
--
a
response
to
petitioner's
principal
contentions.
but
before
doing
this,
i
think
it
would
help
to
focus
on
this
problem
to
set
forth
clearly
those
matters
about
which
there
is
no
dispute.
we
have
no
dispute
with
gouled.
we
have
no
dispute
with
any
of
the
cases
cited
by
petitioner.
these
are
the
matters
which
are
not
in
dispute.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
hotel
suite
occupied
by
the
petitioner
was
an
area
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
fourth
amendment
can
under
some
circumstances
be
violated
not
only
by
a
forceful
invasion
but
by
stealthy
or
deceptive
entry.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
however
on
pages
133
and
134
that
the
conduct
of
partin
did
not
amount
to
the
type
of
deceptive
invasion
prohibited
by
the
amendment.
petitioner
hoffa
knew
partin's
identity.
he
knew
that
he
posses
the
legal
right
to
exclude
him
and
he
knew
that
he
didn't
have
to
speak
to
him
anytime,
anyplace.
now,
petitioner's
brief
is
at
pangs
to
establish
that
verbal
statements
can
be
the
subject
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
we
do
not
disagree
but
petitioner
goes
on
to
state
that
every
statement,
every
statement
made
within
the
confines
of
a
protected
area
is
constitutionally
protected.
and
here,
we
sharply
disagree.
the
statements
made
by
petitioners
hoffa
or
petitioners
king
were
not
made
in
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
parties
were
at
that
time
in
the
hotel
suite
of
hoffa.
the
statements
bore
no
relationship
to
the
privacy
of
that
suite.
they
could
have
been
made
on
the
street,
an
open
field,
in
a
hotel
lobby.
in
fact,
some
of
the
statements,
two
pages
in
petitioner's
brief
is
devoted
to
setting
forth
these
statements
as
obvious
that
many
other
made
more
elsewhere
which
again
just
demonstrates
the
irrelevancy
of
the
place
where
statements
of
this
nature
and
quality
are
made.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
they
could
have
been
made
in
a
public
place,
a
place
not
within
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment,
an
open
field.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
--
a
person
has
the
protection.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
but
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
but
wherever
a
person
is,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
his
voluntary
statements
made
to
an
auditor.
the
--
that
sort
of
statement,
the
risk
the
person
runs
is
that
the
auditor
will
repeat
the
statements
and
that
risk
has
no
relation
to
the
place
of
a
state.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
indeed
it
does.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that
is
speaking
in
terms
of
place
and
not
to
whom.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
the
--
in
the
osborne
case
you
heard
argument
yesterday
and
this
morning
and
there
was
testimony
in
that
record
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
and
mr.
vick
going
to
the
alley
to
have
a
private
conversation,
dealing
at
the
alley
was
a
private
place.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
prior
decisions
upon
which
petitioner
appears
to
rely
aren't
inconsistent
really
with
our
analysis
of
the
protection
which
lies
behind
the
fourth
amendment,
the
silverman
case.
government
agents
there
eavesdropped
by
means
of
penetration
into
a
protected
area.
that
issue
just
isn't
present
in
this
case.
in
gouled
relied
on
most
forcefully
by
petitioners.
a
government
agent
pretended
to
make
a
friendly
call,
gained
entrance
in
that
deceptive
manner
and
then
when
the
owner
of
the
premises
was
absent
surreptitiously
took
documents.
in
this
case,
in
the
context
of
the
cases
before
the
court
here,
this
would
be
analogous
to
as
hiding
in
the
closet
and
overhearing
statements
which
were
not
intended
for
that
auditor
to
hear.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
resemble
in
some
ways
those
in
lopez
v.
united
states.
there,
an
internal
revenue
agent
pretended
deceptively
to
collaborate
in
defendant's
efforts
to
bribe
him.
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
unlawful
invasion
of
defendant's
office
because
of
this,
the
deception
and
pointed
out
that
he
did
not
violate
the
privacy
of
the
office
by
seizing
something
surreptitiously
without
petitioner's
knowledge.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
even
those
who
dissented
in
lopez
did
not
do
so
on
the
basis
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation
had
occurred
because
the
government
agent
had
not
disclosed
his
real
intentions.
in
fact
the
language
of
the
dissenters
supports
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
the
language
i
referred
to
is
that
which
relates
to
it
is
not
an
undue
risk
to
ask
persons
to
assume
for
it
does
no
more
than
compel
them
to
use
discretion
in
choosing
their
auditors
and
to
make
damaging
disclosures
only
to
persons
whose
character
and
motives
may
be
trusted.
there
is
a
final
important
point
which
was
emphasized
in
the
government's
brief
in
lewis.
it's
equally
applicable
here.
the
fourth
amendment
rule
contended
for
by
petitioner
would
very
seriously
hamper
the
government's
use
of
informants
as
i
have
pointed
out
there
is
no
logical
connection
between
the
privacy
of
a
fourth
amendment
area
and
the
fact
that
a
person
engaged
in
committing
a
crime
intentionally
makes
statements
to
an
informer.
now,
acceptance
of
petitioner's
fourth
amendment
argument
would
mean
that
the
government
would
be
completely
barred
from
using
the
testimony
of
an
informer
where
it
relates
to
statements
made
by
an
accused
to
the
informer
inside
the
accuser's
house,
his
apartment,
his
office,
his
automobile.
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
effective
use
of
informers
would
be
seriously
curtailed.
with
respect
to
the
general
subject
before
the
court,
the
use
of
informants,
there
is
unfortunately
crept
into
our
society
the
tendency
to
deprecate
private
citizens
who
assist
law
enforcement
agencies.
whether
that
assistance
be
a
physical
or
testimonial
and
this
of
course
is
true
in
spades
for
the
informant.
but
as
our
society
becomes
increasingly
complex
and
sophisticated,
so
does
the
rapacity
of
those
who
would
corrupt
society.
now,
continuing
criminal
schemes
such
as
those
involving
espionage
or
the
deprivation
of
civil
rights
has
as
an
important
part
of
its
code,
the
code
of
silence,
penetration
by
informants
is
virtually
essential
in
this
context.
now,
any
criminal
scheme
which
is
well
bank-rolled
and
well-planned
provides
a
very
substantial
amount
of
insulation
to
the
top
layers.
now,
this
is
particularly
true
when
we
deal
with
consensual
crimes,
crimes
such
as
gambling,
narcotics,
bribery,
jury
tampering.
now,
unlike
crimes
of
violence,
these
consensual
crimes
do
not
have
individual
victims.
the
only
victim
of
this
sort
of
crime
is
the
body
politic.
you
don't
find
a
successful
jury
fixer
nor
do
you
find
a
juryman
who
sold
his
vote
coming
into
complaint.
this
sort
of
crime,
consensual
crime,
victimless
crime
if
you
will
is
not
just
difficult
to
prove.
it's
often
difficult
to
discover.
unfortunately,
these
victimless
crimes
are
those
which
i
feel
most
perniciously
corrode
our
society.
as
co-counsel
on
the
brief
i
have
with
me
mr.
lewin
who
argued
the
portion
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
request
ten
minutes
for
mr.
lewin
i
believe
that's
within
the
time
of
the
government.
