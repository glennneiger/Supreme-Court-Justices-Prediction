justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
may
be
--
that
may
be
agreed
upon
between
you
and
the
government
but
i
must
say
i
have
difficulty
understanding
why
these
entries
were
illegal.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
--
let's
say
when
a
plane
clothes
detective
enters
premises
to
investigate
whether
or
not
illegal
activities,
criminal
activities
going
on
there,
is
that
an
illegal
entry?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
said
a
plane
clothes.
justice
potter
stewart
a
policeman
who
wasn't
obviously
a
plane
--
justice
potter
stewart
hide
the
fact
that
partin
was
what?
justice
potter
stewart
engaging
in
them,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
because
they
trusted
the
jailer
who
was
on
duty
at
that
period.
justice
potter
stewart
defense
in
it
--
the
--
at
that
time
did
the
judge
have
the
time
--
all
of
the
facts
which
now
have
been
now
unearth?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
does
this
record
show?
what
kind
of
an
investigation
was
it?
what
was
going
on
there?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
what
--
how
many
phone
calls,
a
180,
you
just
say?
justice
potter
stewart
he
recorded
them
all?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
vinson,
the
--
i
don't
promote
--
want
to
interfere
with
your
presentation
but
just
so
that
i'll
be
able
to
follow
it
on
my
intention
on
its
relevance,
what
is
the
basic
purpose
of
this
detailed
account,
is
it
to
lead
with
the
element
conclusion
that
mr.
partin
was
not
an
undercover
agent,
was
not
a
government
agent?
does
that
always
happen?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
on
the
hypothesis,
it
was
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
vinson
does
your
case
stand
or
fall
upon
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
mr.
partin
was
a
paid
government
agent?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
--
that
was
given
in
this
trial,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
by
mr.
hoffa,
was
given
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
this,
well,
he
was
on
--
he's
certainly
on
the
horns
of
the
dilemma,
isn't
he
if
he
--
if
the
foundation
of
the
case
against
him
is
mr.
partin's
testimony.
its
pretty
natural
for
him
to
say
in
defense
that
he
didn't
--
he
wasn't
very
closely
associated
with
mr.
partin
during
the
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
very
understandably.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
that
last
statement
of
yours,
i
think
it's
very
forcefully
alleged
by
your
brothers
in
opposition
that
every
entry
that
partin
made
into
that
hotel
suite
was
an
act
of
wrongdoing.
well,
couldn't
have
testified
at
all
if
he
hadn't
been
there.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
every
--
justice
potter
stewart
every
--
each
and
every
entry
was
illegal.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
that.
certainly
these
statements
would
not
and
could've
not
have
been
made
in
public,
could
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
person
is
within
a
--
wherever
he
is
within
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
wherever
he
is
on
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
as
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
does
have
a
great
deal
of
relationship
with
privacy
and
confidentiality,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
not
really
accurate
to
say
that
these
statements
could
have
easily
been
made
anywhere
and
to
a
100
people
of
a
cocktail
party
or
something?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it's
a
private
and
confidential
conversation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
prosecution
was
going
to
try
to
bribe
members
of
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
he
can
(voice
overlap)
he
doesn't
have
that
evidence
for
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
it
and
he
wants
to
get
evidence
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
difference
does
all
this
make?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
a
government
agent,
wasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
whether
he
was
paid
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
he
was
paid
by
going
easy
on
these
indictments
against
him
or
whether
he
was
paid
$1200
or
$12,000
or
12
cents,
doesn't
make
much
very
difference
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
the
constitutional
question.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
also
true,
isn't
it
also
true
mr.
lewin
that
the
--
that
every
individual
person
is
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
no
matter
how
big
a
crowd
he
is
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
in
the
middle
of
grand
central
station,
he
has
fourth
amendment
protection?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
--
how
about
griswold
against
connecticut
for
instance?
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitutional
right
of
privacy.
justice
potter
stewart
almost
--
most
words
are
verbalized
either
orally
or
written
they
are
verbalized
thoughts
and
certainly
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
expression
not
only
that
which
is
put
down
on
paper
but
expression
which
is
oral,
does
it
not
or
it
can?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
they've
spoken
to
you
in
confidence
and
in
private.
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
public.
justice
potter
stewart
a
breach
of
your
right
of
privacy
by
a
government
agent,
now
don't
you
think
griswold
against
connecticut
has
some
bearing
on
this?
justice

stewart
well,
that
may
