any
--
justice

l.
black
none
was
offered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
evidence
was
offered
on

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
other
in
the
record,
how
much
he
was
paid
by
the
union
during
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
local
teamster
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
grimsley's
inside
--
position
with
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
located
in
atlanta.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
not
located
in
washington?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
a
long
distance
call
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
he
got
out
of
jail
on
another
bond?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
made
the
bail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
already
out
on
the
federal
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
that
was
cancelled
he
made
another
bond?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
when
was
the
federal
charge
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
how
many
months
before
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
the
federal
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
even
got
that
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
in
four
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
october.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
reason
shown
for
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
security
aspect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
denied
by
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
take
the
position
do
you
not
i
presume
you
used,
the
government
has
a
right
to
hire
somebody
or
to
get
somebody
or
to
accept
the
service
of
somebody.
over
here,
what
said
between
people
connects
with
the
contemplated
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
does
it
make
any
difference
that
the
government
utilizes
a
person
and
pays
him
something
for
their
services?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
facts
of
this
--
seems
to
be
is
that
he
consented
with
the
man
being
in
his
room.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
thought
the
man
was
loyal
to
him
and
he
was
loyal
to
somebody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
if
the
government
placed
in
there
a
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me
like
the
government's
willing
to
admit
they
gladly
took
advantage
of
his
services,
whatever
the
motive
he
had
in
giving
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
then
compensated
him
by
paying
his
wife.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
give
it
to
him,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what's
the
difference
in
saying
he
--
they
didn't
put
him
there,
and
they
didn't
keep
him
there,
they
kept
him
there,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
it
functioned,
he
stayed
there
and
reported
to
them
daily
for
a
long
time
with
their
knowledge
and
their
acquiescence
and
their
consent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
who
hoffa
thought
was
his
friend
and
going
to
operate
with
him
and
going
to
help
him
do
any
--
whatever
was
to
be
done
and
he's
just
mistaken
in
