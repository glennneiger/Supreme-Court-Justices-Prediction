mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
take
these
ten
minutes
if
i
may
to
clarify
some
of
the
issues
which
have
been
raised
and
discussed
during
the
justices'
questioning.
particularly
going
to
the
chief
justice's
question
relating
to
the
sixth
amendment,
i
think
that
the
critical
point
in
this
case,
and
the
point
on
which
the
government
stands
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
in
the
record
or
any
shred
of
suspicion
that
there
was
any
attempt
by
the
government
in
any
way
to
place
an
informant
in
the
counsels
of
the
defense
to
learn
defense
strategy.
i
believe
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
if
the
government
had
in
fact
had
a
paid
government
agent
to
learn
defense
secrets
whether
we
would
be
contending
that
the
testimony
of
such
an
agent
would
be
admissible
in
the
trial
of
these
petitioners
in
chattanooga.
in
effect,
i
think
although
it
might
possibly
be
arguable
that
we
could
separate
out
the
testimony
of
the
informant,
we
think
that
would
be
a
far,
far
harder
and
more
difficult
case
and
present
much
more
serious
dangers
of
infringement
of
constitutional
liberty.
certainly,
the
government
may
not
plant
an
informant
in
the
counsels
of
the
defense
such
as
the
chief
justice
analogized
it
to
a
defendant
planting
an
informant
in
the
counsels
of
the
government
to
learn
strategy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
difference
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
is
that
he
would
then
be
required
to
bring
the
evidence
so
some
law
enforcement
authority.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
so
long
as
he
is
not
attempting
to
get
government
strategy.
so
long
as
he
is
not
interested
in
effect
in
undermining
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
the
government
and
his
right
to
a
fair
trial,
we
think
he
can
take
steps
to
secure
that
evidence
and
that's
really
the
position
that
the
government
is
in
this
case.
the
government
not
having
any
interest
at
all
in
learning
trial
strategy
nonetheless
knows
that
jury
tampering
occurs
during
a
trial
and
its
only
during
a
trial
that
a
defendant,
that
a
man
or
primarily
during
a
trial
that
a
man
discusses
attempts
to
bribe
a
juror.
now,
in
this
case
because
of
all
the
background
prior
to
the
nashville
trial,
there
was
reason
for
the
government
to
believe
that
there
may
be
other
unlawful
activity.
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely
mr.--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
compensation
question
mr.
justice
black
is
involved
in
the
record
and
the
fact
is
that
the
government
has
never
conceded
and
we
do
not
concede
now
that
that
was
payment
for
his
conduct
during
the
nashville
trial.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
subsequent
to
the
nashville
trial
mr.
justice
black,
he
traveled
around
the
country
--
at
different
places
of
the
country
to
meet
with
government
prosecutors
in
preparation
for
the
forthcoming
trial.
before
that
first
check
was
paid
mr.
justice
black,
he
had
already
run
up
a
bill
substantially
in
excess
of
what
the
government
was
paying
him.
he
was
entitled
to
receive
more
than
that
before
that
first
payment
was
made
to
his
wife
and
that's
the
reason
that
the
government
undertook
to
make
these
payments
that
way
because
they
knew
that
at
every
payment
that
was
being
made,
there
was
more
being
owed
to
this
man
in
the
way
of
return
compensation
for
his
services
than
he
--
then
was
in
fact
being
paid
to
his
wife
as
of
that
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
he
was
a
government
agent.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
he
--
even
if
he
wasn't
before
october
22nd
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
he
was
on
october
23rd
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
absolutely.
we
think
he
was
a
government
agent
but
he
was
not
a
government
agent
mr.
justice
stewart
to
learn
defense
secrets
and
we
think
that's
a
critical
difference.
if
he
were
a
government
agent
to
learn
defense
secrets
then
we
believe
that
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
would
be
very
material
to
this
case
because
then
it
would
be
very
difficult
if
--
but
the
government
would
entitled
to
put
in
an
informant
in
the
defense
camp
to
learn
defense
secrets,
then
you'd
never
be
able
to
know
whether
the
government
is
in
effect
gotten
defense
secrets
which
have
infected
the
trial
or
not.
but
when
the
only
--
excuse
me.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
think
that
nonetheless
that
would
present
a
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
simply
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
would.
but
i
think
if
we
had
--
if
we
--
if
they
were
evidence
that
we
had
put
this
man
there
to
learn
defense
secrets,
to
be
in
the
counsel
for
the
defense,
to
tell
us
what
the
defendant
was
intending
to
do,
we
--
i
think
that
might
very
well
go
back
to
petitioner's
argument
which
mr.
justice
stewart
characterized
as
very
forceful
at
every
entry
of
his
into
a
room
was
in
some
way
of
an
unlawful
entry
because
he
was
going
in
there
to
learn
defense
secret.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
true.
but
he
wasn't
even
planted
in
nashville
to
be
in
the
counsel
for
the
defense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
--
they
were
interested
in
his
remaining
there
mr.
justice
black.
we
never
--
he
was
never
instructed
that
record
is
unequivocal
on
this
point.
he
was
never
instructed
to
remain
there.
he
was
never
told
to
remain,
never
even
--
he
was
never
told
to
come
back.
he
came
back
because
he
knew
that
it
was
in
the
government's
interest
and
in
his
own
interest
to
come
back
and
speak
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
their
acquiescence
and
consent
in
obtaining
information
of
illegal
activities
and
that
we
think
is
really
the
crux
of
this
case
that
that
is
the
all
the
government
was
interested
in
and
not
in
the
counsels
of
the
defense.
and
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
the
government
was
ever
attempting
to
get
into
the
counsels
of
the
defense.
or
--
and
it
is
our
contention
in
fact
that
the
one
incident
that
really
did
come
out,
as
to
the
counsels
of
the
defense
was
entirely
unintentional.
it
was
an
instant
in
which
both
partin
and
sheridan
to
whom
he
reported
believed
that
there
was
illegal
activity
going
on
that
possibly
there
was
subornation
of
perjury
because
the
way
partin
reported
the
story,
there
were
written
out
questions
and
answers
being
given
to
witnesses.
now,
partin
reported
that
story
to
sheridan
and
sheridan
had
on
the
basis
of
that
report
every
reason
to
believe
that
there
--
they
were
prepared
testimony
that
was
being
handed
to
these
witnesses
from
which
they
could
testify.
and
let
me
just
turn
very
briefly
if
i
may
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
think
that
the
answer
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
is
really
dual.
one
is
that
partin
was
invited
into
hoffa's
suite.
hoffa
knew
who
he
was.
he
may
not
have
known
what
his
purpose
was
in
speaking
to
him
but
he
was
invited
in
there
with
full
kowledge
as
to
his
identity
and
hoffa
spoke
to
him
voluntarily
in
the
suite
without
any
suggestion
of
coercion
in
the
--
into
the
hotel
suite.
the
second
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
suppose
it
was
his
brother
and
the
government
paid
him
to
get
into
his
counsel,
would
that
make
any
difference?
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
would
not
make
any
difference
under
the
fourth
amendment
mr.
chief
justice.
if
--
for
the
government
to
pay
somebody's
brother
to
report
on
him
might
very
well
possibly
conceivably
presented
some
due
process
claim.
we
don't
think
it
would
be
important.
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
we
don't
think
it
would
make
a
difference
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
under
the
fourth
amendment,
no,
none
whatever.
there
--
or
there
comes
a
point
and
i
think
your
honor
suggested
that
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
lopez
in
which
possibly
playing
--
the
government's
playing
on
camaraderie
in
crime
or
in
close
relationship
on
a
close
relationship
of
an
informant
to
a
defendant
may
present
due
process
questions.
but
nobody
suggest
that
partin's
relationship
to
hoffa
was
such
that
those
kinds
of
questions
were
presented
in
this
case.
he
was
an
acquaintance
of
five
years
standing
and
one
with
whom
hoffa
worked
closely
on
teamster
business.
mr.
nathan
lewin
absolutely,
he
just
misplaced
his
confidence.
and
that
we
say
is
really
the
gravamen
of
the
invasion
here,
of
the
intrusion.
the
intrusion
here
isn't
on
a
privacy
of
the
suite.
it's
true
as
mr.
justice
stewart
point
out
that
this
conversation
--
these
conversations
were
not
conversations
that
hoffa
would
have
made
at
a
cocktail
party
but
so
far
as
disclosing
them
to
partin
was
concern,
it
really
made
no
difference
that
he
was
in
the
suite.
hoffa
would
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely.
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely,
but
to
the
extent
that
a
disclosure
of
a
voluntary
statement,
is
any
invasion
of
a
person
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
only
an
invasion
of
his
thoughts,
of
his
secret
thoughts.
if
i
seek
to
you
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
why
is
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
well,
--
true
there
may
be
a
penumbra
of
rights
around
the
fourth
amendment
but
we
don't
think
that
a
voluntary
disclosure
comes
within
that
penumbra
of
rights.
a
voluntary
disclosure,
if
i
am
speaking
with
you,
then
a
voluntary
disclosure
is
merely
as
statement
which
you
under
no
coercion
are
obtaining
from
me.
it
may
be
my
thoughts
but
thoughts
have
never
been
held
to
be
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment.
if
a
thought,
if
a
statement
of
a
thought
were
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment,
then
every
coerced
confession
would
be
a
fourth
amendment
case
and
not
a
fifth
amendment
case
because
if
you
coerce
the
man
to
disclose
his
thoughts,
then
obviously
you've
unreasonably
seized
his
thoughts
in
that
sense.
so
it
--
you
really
can't
say
that
hoffa's
face
to
face
conversation
with
partin
amounted
to
an
invasion
of
his
fourth
amendment
right
to
be
private
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
definitely
does.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
definitely
does
but
our
contention
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
statements
are
voluntary
then
the
fourth
amendment
protects
them
from
disclosure
or
from
seizure
by
--
when
you're
making
them
within
a
protected
area
by
people
who
are
eavesdropping,
by
outsiders
but
not
by
the
people
to
whom
you're
communicating
them.
your
intention
is
to
communicate
them,
communicate
it
to
them.
they
have
unreasonably
seized
anything.
they've
spoken
with
you
and
you've
intentionally
communicated
with
them.
and
they're
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right
and
their
disclosure
though
is
in
that
extent
a
breach
of
confidence
but
i
know
--
we
know
of
no
case
where
a
breach
of
confidence
has
been
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
really
think
it
is.
i
think
it
does
extend
the
fourth
amendment
possibly
beyond
its
very
precise
terms,
but
i
think
it's
never
been
held
really
to
apply
to
--
by
the
thoughts
in
that
sense
and
that's
really
what's
involved
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to

to
learn
defense
secrets
then
we
believe
that
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
would
be
very
material
to
this
case
because
then
it
would
be
very
difficult
if
--
but
the
government
would
entitled
to
put
in
an
informant
in
the
defense
camp
to
learn
defense
secrets,
then
you'd
never
be
able
to
know
whether
the
government
is
in
effect
gotten
defense
secrets
which
have
infected
the
trial
or
not.
but
when
the
only
--
excuse
me.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
think
that
nonetheless
that
would
present
a
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
simply
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
would.
but
i
think
if
we
had
--
if
we
--
if
they
were
evidence
that
we
had
put
this
man
there
to
learn
defense
secrets,
to
be
in
the
counsel
for
the
defense,
to
tell
us
what
the
defendant
was
intending
to
do,
we
--
i
think
that
might
very
well
go
back
to
petitioner's
argument
which
mr.
justice
stewart
characterized
as
very
forceful
at
every
entry
of
his
into
a
room
was
in
some
way
of
an
unlawful
entry
because
he
was
going
in
there
to
learn
defense
secret.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
true.
but
he
wasn't
even
planted
in
nashville
to
be
in
the
counsel
for
the
defense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
--
they
were
interested
in
his
remaining
there
mr.
justice
black.
we
never
--
he
was
never
instructed
that
record
is
unequivocal
on
this
point.
he
was
never
instructed
to
remain
there.
he
was
never
told
to
remain,
never
even
--
he
was
never
told
to
come
back.
he
came
back
because
he
knew
that
it
was
in
the
government's
interest
and
in
his
own
interest
to
come
back
and
speak
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
their
acquiescence
and
consent
in
obtaining
information
of
illegal
activities
and
that
we
think
is
really
the
crux
of
this
case
that
that
is
the
all
the
government
was
interested
in
and
not
in
the
counsels
of
the
defense.
and
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
the
government
was
ever
attempting
to
get
into
the
counsels
of
the
defense.
or
--
and
it
is
our
contention
in
fact
that
the
one
incident
that
really
did
come
out,
as
to
the
counsels
of
the
defense
was
entirely
unintentional.
it
was
an
instant
in
which
both
partin
and
sheridan
to
whom
he
reported
believed
that
there
was
illegal
activity
going
on
that
possibly
there
was
subornation
of
perjury
because
the
way
partin
reported
the
story,
there
were
written
out
questions
and
answers
being
given
to
witnesses.
now,
partin
reported
that
story
to
sheridan
and
sheridan
had
on
the
basis
of
that
report
every
reason
to
believe
that
there
--
they
were
prepared
testimony
that
was
being
handed
to
these
witnesses
from
which
they
could
testify.
and
let
me
just
turn
very
briefly
if
i
may
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
think
that
the
answer
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
is
really
dual.
one
is
that
partin
was
invited
into
hoffa's
suite.
hoffa
knew
who
he
was.
he
may
not
have
known
what
his
purpose
was
in
speaking
to
him
but
he
was
invited
in
there
with
full
kowledge
as
to
his
identity
and
hoffa
spoke
to
him
voluntarily
in
the
suite
without
any
suggestion
of
coercion
in
the
--
into
the
hotel
suite.
the
second
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
suppose
it
was
his
brother
and
the
government
paid
him
to
get
into
his
counsel,
would
that
make
any
difference?
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
would
not
make
any
difference
under
the
fourth
amendment
mr.
chief
justice.
if
--
for
the
government
to
pay
somebody's
brother
to
report
on
him
might
very
well
possibly
conceivably
presented
some
due
process
claim.
we
don't
think
it
would
be
important.
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
we
don't
think
it
would
make
a
difference
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
under
the
fourth
amendment,
no,
none
whatever.
there
--
or
there
comes
a
point
and
i
think
your
honor
suggested
that
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
lopez
in
which
possibly
playing
--
the
government's
playing
on
camaraderie
in
crime
or
in
close
relationship
on
a
close
relationship
of
an
informant
to
a
defendant
may
present
due
process
questions.
but
nobody
suggest
that
partin's
relationship
to
hoffa
was
such
that
those
kinds
of
questions
were
presented
in
this
case.
he
was
an
acquaintance
of
five
years
standing
and
one
with
whom
hoffa
worked
closely
on
teamster
business.
mr.
nathan
lewin
absolutely,
he
just
misplaced
his
confidence.
and
that
we
say
is
really
the
gravamen
of
the
invasion
here,
of
the
intrusion.
the
intrusion
here
isn't
on
a
privacy
of
the
suite.
it's
true
as
mr.
justice
stewart
point
out
that
this
conversation
--
these
conversations
were
not
conversations
that
hoffa
would
have
made
at
a
cocktail
party
but
so
far
as
disclosing
them
to
partin
was
concern,
it
really
made
no
difference
that
he
was
in
the
suite.
hoffa
would
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely.
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely,
but
to
the
extent
that
a
disclosure
of
a
voluntary
statement,
is
any
invasion
of
a
person
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
only
an
invasion
of
his
thoughts,
of
his
secret
thoughts.
if
i
seek
to
you
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
why
is
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
well,
--
true
there
may
be
a
penumbra
of
rights
around
the
fourth
amendment
but
we
don't
think
that
a
voluntary
disclosure
comes
within
that
penumbra
of
rights.
a
voluntary
disclosure,
if
i
am
speaking
with
you,
then
a
voluntary
disclosure
is
merely
as
statement
which
you
under
no
coercion
are
obtaining
from
me.
it
may
be
my
thoughts
but
thoughts
have
never
been
held
to
be
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment.
if
a
thought,
if
a
statement
of
a
thought
were
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment,
then
every
coerced
confession
would
be
a
fourth
amendment
case
and
not
a
fifth
amendment
case
because
if
you
coerce
the
man
to
disclose
his
thoughts,
then
obviously
you've
unreasonably
seized
his
thoughts
in
that
sense.
so
it
--
you
really
can't
say
that
hoffa's
face
to
face
conversation
with
partin
amounted
to
an
invasion
of
his
fourth
amendment
right
to
be
private
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
definitely
does.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
definitely
does
but
our
contention
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
statements
are
voluntary
then
the
fourth
amendment
protects
them
from
disclosure
or
from
seizure
by
--
when
you're
making
them
within
a
protected
area
by
people
who
are
eavesdropping,
by
outsiders
but
not
by
the
people
to
whom
you're
communicating
them.
your
intention
is
to
communicate
them,
communicate
it
to
them.
they
have
unreasonably
seized
anything.
they've
spoken
with
you
and
you've
intentionally
communicated
with
them.
and
they're
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right
and
their
disclosure
though
is
in
that
extent
a
breach
of
confidence
but
i
know
--
we
know
of
no
case
where
a
breach
of
confidence
has
been
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
really
think
it
is.
i
think
it
does
extend
the
fourth
amendment
possibly
beyond
its
very
precise
terms,
but
i
think
it's
never
been
held
really
to
apply
to
--
by
the
thoughts
in
that
sense
and
that's
really
what's
involved
here.
