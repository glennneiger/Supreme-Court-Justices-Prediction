brennan,

may
i
ask
you
before
you
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
even
if
the
sugar
company
hadn't
come
upon
the
statute,
if
one
of
the
judges
had,
you'd
still
be
here,
you
would
have
the
same
result,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
no,
no,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
you
and
your
adversary
overlooked
it
but
i
remember
the
supreme
court
had
come
upon
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
suppose,
it'd
be
the
same
result?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
was
thinking.
so
it's
not
so
much
that
the
defendant
for
the
first
time
raised
this
in
the
supreme
court
as
it
is
that
the
supreme
court
relied
on
it
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

if
there's
a
pair
of
adults
then
no
adult
can
recover
except
for
gross
negligence
or
willful
or
wanton
misconduct.
no
adult
can
recover
--
a
trespassing
adult
can't
recover
for
ordinary
negligence
but
every
child
in
the
state
of
michigan
can
recover,
a
trespassing
child
can
recover
for
ordinary
negligence
except
those
few
insignificant
children
who
may
hunt,
fish
or
trap
and
their
--
believe
me,
if
they
go
out
with
a
slingshot
to
get
a
bird
or
they've
got
a
home
made
fishing
pole
which
every
boy
has
to
classify
them
in
the
same
category
as
the
adult
hunter,
fisher
or
trapper
is
that
it
seems
to
me
invidious
and
especially
so
when
we
have
a
rule
protecting
little
children
so
that
any
other
child
of
the
same
8
year
old
--
any
other
8
year
old
child
can
recover
for
ordinary
negligence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.

j.
brennan,
