justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
(voice
overlap)
--
why
didn't
you
have
that
right
already?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
it
was
your
--
but
the
plaintiff
is
suppose
to
prove
their
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
if
at
that
--
at
the
time
your
case
had
closed
the
defense
had
gotten
up
and
move
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
you
hadn't
made
out
yet
--
you
hadn't
made
out
a
case,
you
had
failed
to
prove
the
consideration.
namely,
the
consideration
required
for
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
were
to
think
--
i
would
have
--
if
the
statute,
if
that
were
brought,
i
think
he'd
been
out
of
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
even
they
were
a
pair
of
adults
under
the
statute,
the
same
result
would
follow?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
your
opponent
raised
it
in
his
brief
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
had
a
chance
to
respond
to
that
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
supreme
court
of
michigan.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
respondent
raised
the
statute
in
the
supreme
court
of
michigan.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
his
brief
there,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
if
he
put
it
in
his
brief
anyway,
then
you'd
a
chance
to
respond
to
that
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
and
your
argument
was
to
the
supreme
court
that
the
statute
should
be
unavailable
to
him
at
this
point
since
he
had
never
raised
it
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
--
and
you
could've
gone
on
and
said
further
more
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
supreme
court
to
rely
on
that
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
he
asked
them
to
dismiss
the
case.
here,
the
respondent
asked
them
to
dismiss.
he
just
didn't
ask
for
a
new
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me
mr.
plotkin
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
there
evidence
of
in
the
trial
record
that
these
children
were
in
fact
hunting,
fishing,
or
whatever
it
is
that
makes
them
pleasant?
justice
byron
r.
white
28?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
the
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
least
there
would've
been
a
request
for
instruction
to
the
jury
to
find
gross
negligence,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
would've
been
an
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
trial
--
you
say
it's
--
it
has
then
called
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
and
both
counsel
had
then
known
about
it,
don't
you
think
there
had
--
there
would've
been
amendment
to
the
complaint
or
some
attempt
to
rely
on
gross
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
by
this
court,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
they
pleaded
to
the
prove
the
facts
so
--
going
with
the
statute
(inaudible)
--
is
that
so
far
as
you
--
do
you
really
mean
to
say
that
they
didn't
do
--
they
get
to
--
how
about
gross
negligence?
justice
byron

i

the
