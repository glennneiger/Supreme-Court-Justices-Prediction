justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
you
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
they
didn't
raise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
were
–
you'd
view
it
to
think
–
to
know
that
in
fact
it
could
be
used
in
the
upper
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
hadn't
been
raised
in
the
lower
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
had
been
raised
in
the
lower
court
could
the
other
side
have
proceeded
there
enough
to
get
into
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
amend
in
the
court
below.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
did
raise
the
question
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
between
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
present
the
quest
--
the
same
question
in
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
he
is
presenting
to
us
now,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
after
they
had
ruled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
he
should
ask
them
for
leave
to
amend?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
didn't
--
he
asked
for
it
to
be
remanded
back
so
he
could
try
it
over,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
on
his
motion
for
rehearing,
what
did
he
ask?
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
wanted
the
others
(inaudible)
to
show
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
he
didn't
raise
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
his
equal
protection
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
know
about
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
had
--
still
call
that
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge,
would
this
trial
had
been
a
different
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
he
hadn't
waived
it
--
into
this
case.
well,
he
finally
cut
it
off
--
suppose
if
(inaudible)
known
about
it
and
he
had
known
that
this
was
(inaudible),
you
wouldn't
have
known
about
it
and
the
other
side
have
known
about
it,
wouldn't
this
has
been
an
entirely
different
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
--
in
this
for
example,
neither
one
of
them
knew
about
that
statute.
it
was
a
very
material
statute
and
certainly
--
and
could
result
in
concluding
the
case
for
the
plaintiff.
suppose
the
plaintiff
had
known
of
that
and
you
have
known
but
--
into
the
fact
and
all
--
just
in
evidence,
they
were
to
amend
their
complaint
and
sued
on
the
other
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
they
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
have
is
the
case
was
decided
without
him
--
knowledge
of
it,
nobody
--
you
didn't
say
anything
about
it.
you
say
you
didn't
know
it
at
that
time.
but
you
didn't
say
anything
about
it
and
you
got
up
to
the
court
and
then
you
raised
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
--
at
the
trial
--
in
the
trial
on
the
issue
that
they
could
have
tried
and
them
having
--
been
known
at
the
beginning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
seems
to
be
rather
natural
for
them
to
do
it
and
you
only
cited
in
the
law
review
articles.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
you
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
they
didn't
raise?
justice
hugo
