justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
allege
didn't
you
that
james
heider,
a
minor
son
of
plaintiff,
herbert
heider,
that
they
set
out
to
muskrat
trap
(inaudible)
on
this
day.
justice
abe
fortas
when
this
happened,
on
the
21st
day
of
december?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
look
what
this
paragraph
says,
paragraph
27
on
your
declaration
on
page
4,
they
set
out
muskrat
trapping.
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
since
on
--
its
james
who
is
12
years
old.
justice
abe
fortas
with
his
brother
david
who
was
8
years
old?
justice
abe
fortas
and
a
dog,
the
declaration
didn't
say
how
old
he
was,
set
out
muskrat
trapping.
justice
abe
fortas
well
mr.
plotkin,
the
other
question
under
the
statute
is
whether
these
deaths
were
cause
by
the
gross
negligence
or
willful
and
wanton
misconduct
in
the
michigan
sugar
company
in
the
way
that
it
kept
this
place.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
presumably
or
although
i
agree,
the
declaration
and
the
statement
of
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
cited
the
boys
were
there
muskrat
trapping
but
if
this
matter
had
been
an
issue,
there
were
those
who
have
been
an
issue,
the
question
of
whether
the
deaths
were
caused
by
the
gross
negligence
or
of
the
michigan
sugar
company
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
so
that
the
issues
aren't
--
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
settled?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
depends
on
who
has
the
burden
of
pleading
and
going
forward
under
this
particular
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
he
is
proceeding
in
the
common
law,
some
other
statute
that
requires
only
negligence
and
the
question
is
whether
he
had
to
make
it
to
this
statute
as
a
submission
--
proceeding
in
this
cause
of
action.
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
he
ask
them
to
amend?
i
don't
think
he
had
some
to
do
with
the
reverse.
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
is
that?
what's
the
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
why
shouldn't
there
be
one
rule
of
negligence
about
people
who
are
going
to
the
land
of
another
for
swimming
and
another
one
if
they
go
to
the
land
of
another
for
practice?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
curious
way
to
do
it,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not
asking
that
when
i
said
some
other
curios
things
that
assume
that
the
legislators
did
it
for
that
purpose?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
the
same
thing
here
with
respect
to
this
legislation?
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
say
that
the
lawyer
for
any
respondent
had
been
--
know
about
the
existence
of
the
statute,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
that
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
personally
were
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
you
have
made
that
clear.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
sum
total
of
the
result
is
getting
it
without
regard
to
whether
illegal
or
decided
whether
it's
(inaudible).
is
it
tried
on
the
basis
that
they
didn't
know
anything
about
--
couldn't
win
on
it
in
--
on
the
basis
on
what's
construed
on
that
statute
and
this
people
have
been
knocked
out
of
the
trial
on
the
--
for
that
purpose.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
