mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes.
on
december
21st,
1958,
two
small
children,
david
heider,
age
8
and
james
heider,
age
12,
went
upon
the
defendant's
property.
at
that
time
the
defendant
--
respondent,
michigan
sugar
company
maintained
several
acres
of
ponds.
these
ponds
were
connected
up
by
an
overflow
pipe.
the
temperature
at
the
time
was
12
degrees
below
zero
and
the
--
around
the
overflow
pipe
chemicals
and
the
action
of
the
water
create
a
foaming
area
that
resemble
snow.
this
froze
and
the
rest
of
the
pond
was
solid
ice
except
around
the
overflow
pipe
where
this
area
built
up
a
foamy,
snowy
substance
that
itself
was
frozen
and
but
was
not
solid
underneath.
these
two
boys
and
their
little
dog,
a
water
spaniel,
went
upon
the
tenants
property,
became
entrapped
in
this
condition.
this
dangerous,
distracted
condition
maintained
by
the
respondent,
sugar
company,
and
they
were
drowned.
an
action
was
brought
in
the
circuit
court,
saginaw
county
to
recover
for
their
death.
the
jury
in
the
case
of
david
heider,
it
turned
a
verdict
in
the
amount
of
$125,000
and
the
judge
in
the
companion
case,
james
heider
because
of
different
measure
of
damages
returned
a
judgment
$41,000.
a
case
--
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
filed
by
the
respondent
except
for
a
certain
reasons
and
grounds
for
appeal.
the
motion
was
denied.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan.
with
all
this
procedure,
so
far
there
has
been
no
complaint
but
then
completely
outside
of
the
record
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan,
the
respondent
michigan
sugar
company
in
its
brief
on
appeal
brought
forth
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court
an
endeavor
to
bring
forth
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court
a
statute
known
as
public
act
201
of
the
public
acts
of
the
state
of
michigan
in
the
year
1953
claiming
that
this
statute
affected
the
case.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that
was
the
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
law,
that's
in
the
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
the
statute
itself
--
our
contention
is
first
of
all
that
i've
never
been
--
had
an
opportunity
or
my
day
in
court
in
relation
to
that
statute.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
right.
and
second
of
--
the
second
major
point
is
that
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
denies
equal
protection
because
it's
an
invidious
discrimination
against
a
child,
against
the
children
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
both
those
questions
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
this
is
the
--
this
will
have
to
--
this
is
a
question
that
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
now
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
what
happened
isn't
--
when
it
was
raised
the
objection
that
was
made
to
the
statute
was
that
--
it's
not
an
orderly
procedure.
you're
completely
outside
the
record.
you
can't
raise
it.
it's
not
proper
to
raise
it
at
this
time.
that
was
the
basic
premise
that
we
went
on
because
the
only
error
--
the
only
basis
upon
which
counsel
claimed
not
prior
raising
the
statute
was
that
he
just
failed
to
find
the
statute
before.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
its
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
sure,
it
should
pleaded
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
right.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
the
statute
that
was
--
should've
been
met
in
the
trial
court
with
statute.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
it
wasn't
and
we
brought
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
right.
and
there
was
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
--
and
no
prior
supreme
court
case
in
michigan
that
ever
granted
the
--that
ever
considered
a
statute
raised
at
the
11th
hour
outside
of
an
orderly
procedure
in
the
absence
of
some
special
or
unusual
circumstances.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
there's
nothing
wrong
with
citing
it.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
the
error
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
no.
the
answer
is
that
i
should
have
an
opportunity
to
have
my
day
in
court
to
prove
in
fact
for
example
that
little
david,
age
8,
he's
physically
incapable
of
setting
a
trap,
owned
no
traps
and
never
did
trap.
i
should
--
i
certainly
should've
had
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
it
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
it
was
never
--
the
statute
was
never
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
by
the
defendant.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
that's
the
point,
is
this
statute
applicable
or
not?
i
never
had
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
two
--
this
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
there
are
two
judges
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
haven't
been
able
to
quite
understand
what
happened
yet.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
there
are
eight
judges
and
two
of
them
said,
"send
it
back
and
dismiss
the
case
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
--
because
it
failed
to
prove
it,
no
cause
of
action."
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
three
of
the
judges
said,
"go
back
and
dismiss
the
case
and
the
complaint
because
you
failed
to
state
a
cause
of
action."
three
other
judges
said
that
under
that
--
i
did
state
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh,
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh,
i
am
precluded.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
am
precluded
because
we
count
heads,
there's
five
--
against
five,
said
i
should
lose,
and
three
said
i
should
win.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
no.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
the
statute
of
limitations
is
right
and
my
point
is
this
is
that
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh,
i
can
amend,
i
can
amend.
the
problem
is
that
basic
rate
fundamentally
a
person
is
entitled
to
a
day
in
court.
and
this
is
a
statute
that
should
have
been
raised
by
the
defense
as
a
--
in
a
proper
manner
in
a
trial
court
so
that
i
have
an
opportunity
to
be
met
with.
so
i
could
--
if
you
look
at
the
actual
facts
like
david
never
owned
traps,
he
couldn't
physically
set
a
trap,
he'd
never
come
within
the
statute.
and
if
you
look
at
the
fact
that
there
was
no
eye
witnesses
to
this
case,
there
was
--
i
mean
no
eye
witnesses
to
the
boys
being
on
the
land
at
the
time
of
their
death
and
their
drowning.
this
present
fact
questions
under
the
statute.
what
was
james
doing
on
the
land
at
that
time?
but
the
supreme
court
by
its
very
actions
has
taken
this
statute
and
apply
it
retroactively
to
whatever
facts
were
shown
or
to
the
pleadings
and
have
barred
me
without
ever
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
have
our
day
in
court
in
relation
to
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
didn't
say
nowhere
in
the
pleadings
or
in
the
record.
is
there
any
statement
that
at
the
time
of
the
death
the
boys
were
actually
trapping
upon
the
land
of
the
michigan
sugar
company.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
21st
day
of
december.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
right.
but
as
i
--
my
answer
to
you
mr.
justice
fortas
is
this.
is
that
first
of
all,
if
i
had
been
met
with
the
statute
i
could've
distinguished
the
--
at
least
what
david
was
doing
as
compared
to
what
james
was
doing
out
of
--
there'd
been
constructive
effort
made
but
in
addition
to
that
you're
reading
what
--
in
interpreting
the
--
my
declaration,
three
of
the
judges
said
that
i
state
that
they
were
trapping
on
a
land,
three
of
the
judges
say
i
don't
state
that
i
was
trapping
on
the
land.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
right.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
but
on
the
other
hand
to
come
under
the
statute
there
had
to
be
muskrat
trapping
on
that
particular
land
at
that
particular
time.
that'd
be
the
first
point
that
i'd
like
to
make.
now,
it
seems
to
me
what's
really
happened
here
is
that
when
you're
prepared
to
have
a
trial
in
a
court
it's
done
in
a
--
suppose
to
be
done
in
an
orderly
fashion.
i
presented
pleadings,
issues
and
we
set
forth
the
basis
and
had
a
trial.
the
defendant,
the
respondent,
michigan
sugar
company
put
in
a
general
denial,
pleaded
contributory
negligence
to
the
minors
and
the
parents
that
after
warning
was
given
not
to
use
the
premises
and
that
they
had
lack
of
knowledge
that
minors
were
upon
the
premises.
we
tried
the
case
upon
those
issues
and
those
--
that
basis
and
then
what
happen
is
the
defendant
is
permitted
to
raise
a
statute
out
of
orderly
proceedings
and
what
does
he
do?
he
get
--
he
binds
the
petitioner
by
his
actions
to
his
pleadings
and
to
the
record
that
he
made
in
the
trial
court.
but
the
defendant
is
permitted
or
the
respondent,
michigan
sugar
company
was
permitted
by
the
action
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
to
revoke
every
bit
of
pleadings,
every
word
that
he
ever
uttered
said
before.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
three
of
them
said
that.
but
two
of
them
said
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
the
other
said
that
i
failed
to
prove
facts
to
take
me
outside
the
statute
and
therefore
i
entered
a
judgment
of
no
cause
of
action.
in
other
words,
i
never
was
met
with
the
statute
on
the
lower
court.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
that's
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
right.
in
this
phraseology,
actually
the
only
thing
that
that
statute
changes
is
the
degree
of
proof,
it
doesn't
eliminate
a
cause
of
action
at
all.
now,
if
i
may
say
a
word
about
equal
protection
here.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
sure.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
if
i've
been
met
with
the
statute
in
the
lower
court,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
suppose
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
alright
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i'd
still
be
here
because
the
supreme
court
by
its
very
action
would
have
been
depriving
me
of
my
day
in
court
because
this
is
what
i'm
complaining
about.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
relied
on
it
all
and
then
so
can
bound
me
by
a
record
and
bound
me
by
a
pleading
relieving
the
defendant
from
or
the
michigan
sugar
company
completely
from
their
--
every
word
they
ever
uttered
and
then
to
my
complete
surprise
dismiss
the
case.
i
mean,
if
they
sent
it
back
for
new
trial
i
could
understand.
i'd
have
a
chance
to
show
that
david
wasn't
trapping
and
that
if
james
was,
that's
a
fact
question
because
nobody
saw
them
at
the
time
they
died.
and
--
but
now
let's
go
on
to
this
question
of
the
equal
protection,
the
--
under
the
--
many
times
i
just
said
your
passed
statutes,
they
don't
really
change
laws.
an
adult
trespasser
in
the
state
of
michigan
before
this
statute
was
passed
could
recover
against
a
landowner
only
for
gross
negligence
or
willful
or
wanton
misconduct.
on
the
other
hand
under
the
common
law
of
michigan
as
developed
by
the
(inaudible)
case
in
which
at
least
40
states
in
the
union
have
adopted
the
theory
of
the
protection
of
the
minor.
we
have
in
the
common
law
of
michigan
that
provides
that
if
a
child
because
of
his
immature
years
goes
upon
the
land
of
another
that
there
can
be
a
recovery
for
ordinary
negligence
upon
a
showing
that
the
landowner
has
knowledge
or
should
know
that
the
children
are
there
and
he
maintains
a
dangerous
condition.
and
this
doctrine
was
enunciated
even
by
this
court
under
the
attractive
nuisance
doctrine
beginning
with
a
turntable
case.
now,
the
effect
of
the
supreme
court's
interpretation
by
applying
this
statute
to
these
two
immature
children
is
saying
that
as
to
a
child
the
only
effect
the
statute
has
is
to
a
child.
the
only
effect
it
has
is
to
the
immature
child
that
it
discriminates
against
the
immature
child
in
relation
to
the
other
immature
child
who
was
upon
the
property.
in
other
words
if
in
fact
one
boy
had
a
slingshot
to
go
hunting
with
or
a
fishing
pole
to
go
fishing
with
and
he
took
a
friend
along
with
him
and
they
both
drowned
under
identical
circumstances
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
time.
the
little
boy
with
the
fishing
pole
cannot
get
a
recovery
as
the
court
applied
this
statute
except
by
proving
gross
negligence
or
willful
or
wanton
misconduct.
but
the
other
boy
who
didn't
have
the
fishing
pole
with
him,
he
can
recover
for
ordinary
negligence
and
this
is
a
peculiar
thing
by
--
in
tradition
interpretation
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh
yes,
it's
in
the
briefs.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes,
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes,
yes.
and
the
reason
is
this
is
that
the
statute
had
never
been
--
let
me
say
a
few
words
here
about
the
question
of
the
timely
raising
of
the
federal
questions
because
somehow
opposing
counsel
has
interjected
this
in
here
saying
that
the
federal
questions
weren't
timely
raised
and
the
answer
to
that
problem
is
this
is
a
--
it
seem
to
me
beyond
reasonable
to
anticipate
that
a
supreme
court
would
act
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister
in
380
u.s.
479,
you
laid
down
the
doctrine
that
--
it's
generally
assumed
that
state
courts
and
prosecutors
will
act
in
a
constitutional
manner.
now,
the
problem
is
that
in
--
it
would
seem
futile
to
me
to
say
to
a
court
before
it
renders
a
decision,
don't
do
it
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
until
there's
an
actual
constitutional
violation
i
can't
raise
the
question.
this
statute
had
never
been
interpreted
before.
it
was
completely
out
--
raised
outside
of
a
record
and
has
a
very
serious
question,
even
the
respondent
admits
at
his
brief
on
page
24,
that's
a
very
serious
question
whether
the
court
was
even
going
to
entertain
the
statute.
then
when
the
court
accepts
the
statute
completely
out
of
procedural
order
then
in
--
applies
it
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
only
then
can
i
raise
the
federal
questions
and
i
think
that
the
case
of
saunders
versus
shaw
is
a
case
that's
directly
in
point
on
this
issue.
it
covers
both
the
issues,
timely
raising
the
federal
question
in
an
action
of
the
supreme
court
denying
you
a
day
in
court
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
and
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
he
never
raised
it
in
--
he
raised
it
in
his
brief
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
which
i
did.
and
no
--
i
beg
you
pardon,
i'm
confused
from
--
do
you
mean
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
or
this
supreme
court?
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
alright,
now
the
respondent
what?
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
don't
have
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
he
put
in
his
brief
but
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
believe
he
raised
it
in
the
supreme
court.
it
was
completely
out
of
an
orderly
procedure.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that
was
one
thing.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
if
the
supreme
court
was
going
to
rely
on
it
and
they
had
sent
--
and
they'd
reverse
to
send
me
back
for
a
new
trial,
there
wouldn't
be
a
constitutional
infringement.
i've
never
expected
them
to
act
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
that's
--
i
couldn't
ask
him
not
to
act
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
he
asked
him
to
reverse
the
case
with
or
without
a
new
trial.
the
last
thing
i'd
expect
them
to
do
is
reverse
the
case
without
a
new
trial
where
you
never
had
an
opportunity
to
have
your
day
in
court
in
relation
to
the
trial
--
in
relation
to
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh,
i
didn't
have
to.
well,
first
of
all
the
object
of
a
trial
is
to
give
to
each
side
a
fair
orderly
proceeding
when
if
this
statute
had
been
raised
in
the
lower
court
by
the
respondent.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
which
they
didn't
raise
then
at
that
time
i
could
have
amended
my
pleadings
if
necessary
or
if
i
thought
it
was
necessary.
i
could
have
--
in
a
trial
of
the
case
shown
that
little
david,
age
8,
was
physically
incapable
of
trapping
and
he
never
trapped
and
he
doesn't
even
come
within
the
statute.
as
far
as
james
is
concern
while
he
own
traps
and
he
was
on
the
land
at
the
time
of
his
death
there
were
no
eye
witnesses
so
it's
a
fact
question
whether
in
fact
at
that
time
he
was
trapping.
but
i'd
never
had
this
opportunity,
it's
been
--
the
doors
been
closed
down.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
the
--
i
say
that
the
statute
--
it's
a
peculiarly
worded
statute
but
it
really
only
changes
the
degree
of
proof,
it
doesn't
eliminate
a
cause
of
action.
it
really
changes
the
degree
of
proof
and
i
say
it's
a
matter
of
defense
that
it
should
have
been
asserted
so
i
wouldn't
be
taken
by
surprise.
he
could've
waited
until
a
trial
was
all
over
then
try
to
put
a
statute
on.
say
look
instead
of
done
something
different.
the
question
is,
it's
to
--
that's
the
object
of
raising
him
so
you
have
an
opportunity
to
have
an
orderly
trial.
that's
why
he
should
have
raised
it
and
to
show
an
affirmative
--
it's
an
affirmative
defense.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
--
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
appreciate
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i've
--
just
like
to
say
this
that
if
i've
been
met
with
the
statute
in
the
lower
court,
had
been
brought
to
anybody's
attention
the
pleadings
could've
been
amended.
i
could've
shown
three
things,
one,
that
david
himself
owned
no
traps,
couldn't
physically
even
set
a
trap
so
he
wouldn't
--
couldn't
be
a
--
possibly
be
a
trapper
and
we
could
cover
for
ordinary
negligence
for
david.
and
as
for
james,
james
owned
traps
and
he
was
trapping.
there
was
no
eye
witnesses
when
he
died
on
that
land
at
that
time
then
it
was
a
question
whether
he
was
trapping
on
that
land
and
that
should've
been
a
jury
question.
but
in
any
event
i
could
have
gone
ahead
and
even
claimed
as
far
as
james
is
concern,
gross
negligence,
namely
that
that
they
had
such
dangerous
condition,
they
knew
that
many
people
came
upon
their
land,
a
couple
of
(inaudible)
sign
of
warning.
they
could've
prevented
this
in
showing
that
there
was
really
a
trap.
i
should've
--
had
that
opportunity,
but
again
this
illustrates
that
really
equal
protection
is
denied
to
this
children
because
why
should
two
children,
david
and
james,
why
should
david
go
on
the
land
and
be
able
because
he's
not
trapping
but
going
along
with
his
brother,
recover
for
ordinary
negligence.
and
his
brother,
who
has
a
trap
and
is
going
to
set
a
trap
on
that
land
have
to
prove
gross
negligence.
why
should
it
be
two
standards
for
two
children
dying
at
the
same
time
at
same
place
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
--
engaged
in
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
and
that's
why
it's
invidious
because
applied
the
statute
as
i
said
under
the
common
law
of
michigan,
children
could
recover
for
ordinary
negligence.
when
they
applied
the
statute
for
the
little
child,
the
immature
child
when
they
say
that
he
is
the
hunter,
the
fisher,
the
trapper,
that's
in
my
opinion,
is
an
invidious
discrimination.
thank
you
kindly
for
your
attention.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes.
on
december
21st,
1958,
two
small
children,
david
heider,
age
8
and
james
heider,
age
12,
went
upon
the
defendant's
property.
at
that
time
the
defendant
--
respondent,
michigan
sugar
company
maintained
several
acres
of
ponds.
these
ponds
were
connected
up
by
an
overflow
pipe.
the
temperature
at
the
time
was
12
degrees
below
zero
and
the
--
around
the
overflow
pipe
chemicals
and
the
action
of
the
water
create
a
foaming
area
that
resemble
snow.
this
froze
and
the
rest
of
the
pond
was
solid
ice
except
around
the
overflow
pipe
where
this
area
built
up
a
foamy,
snowy
substance
that
itself
was
frozen
and
but
was
not
solid
underneath.
these
two
boys
and
their
little
dog,
a
water
spaniel,
went
upon
the
tenants
property,
became
entrapped
in
this
condition.
this
dangerous,
distracted
condition
maintained
by
the
respondent,
sugar
company,
and
they
were
drowned.
an
action
was
brought
in
the
circuit
court,
saginaw
county
to
recover
for
their
death.
the
jury
in
the
case
of
david
heider,
it
turned
a
verdict
in
the
amount
of
$125,000
and
the
judge
in
the
companion
case,
james
heider
because
of
different
measure
of
damages
returned
a
judgment
$41,000.
a
case
--
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
filed
by
the
respondent
except
for
a
certain
reasons
and
grounds
for
appeal.
the
motion
was
denied.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan.
with
all
this
procedure,
so
far
there
has
been
no
complaint
but
then
completely
outside
of
the
record
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan,
the
respondent
michigan
sugar
company
in
its
brief
on
appeal
brought
forth
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court
an
endeavor
to
bring
forth
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court
a
statute
known
as
public
act
201
of
the
public
acts
of
the
state
of
michigan
in
the
year
1953
claiming
that
this
statute
affected
the
case.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that
was
the
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
law,
that's
in
the
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
the
statute
itself
--
our
contention
is
first
of
all
that
i've
never
been
--
had
an
opportunity
or
my
day
in
court
in
relation
to
that
statute.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
right.
and
second
of
--
the
second
major
point
is
that
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
denies
equal
protection
because
it's
an
invidious
discrimination
against
a
child,
against
the
children
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
both
those
questions
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
this
is
the
--
this
will
have
to
--
this
is
a
question
that
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
now
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
what
happened
isn't
--
when
it
was
raised
the
objection
that
was
made
to
the
statute
was
that
--
it's
not
an
orderly
procedure.
you're
completely
outside
the
record.
you
can't
raise
it.
it's
not
proper
to
raise
it
at
this
time.
that
was
the
basic
premise
that
we
went
on
because
the
only
error
--
the
only
basis
upon
which
counsel
claimed
not
prior
raising
the
statute
was
that
he
just
failed
to
find
the
statute
before.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
its
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
sure,
it
should
pleaded
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
right.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
the
statute
that
was
--
should've
been
met
in
the
trial
court
with
statute.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
it
wasn't
and
we
brought
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
right.
and
there
was
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
--
and
no
prior
supreme
court
case
in
michigan
that
ever
granted
the
--that
ever
considered
a
statute
raised
at
the
11th
hour
outside
of
an
orderly
procedure
in
the
absence
of
some
special
or
unusual
circumstances.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
there's
nothing
wrong
with
citing
it.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
the
error
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
no.
the
answer
is
that
i
should
have
an
opportunity
to
have
my
day
in
court
to
prove
in
fact
for
example
that
little
david,
age
8,
he's
physically
incapable
of
setting
a
trap,
owned
no
traps
and
never
did
trap.
i
should
--
i
certainly
should've
had
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
it
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
it
was
never
--
the
statute
was
never
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
by
the
defendant.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
that's
the
point,
is
this
statute
applicable
or
not?
i
never
had
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
two
--
this
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
there
are
two
judges
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
haven't
been
able
to
quite
understand
what
happened
yet.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
there
are
eight
judges
and
two
of
them
said,
"send
it
back
and
dismiss
the
case
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
--
because
it
failed
to
prove
it,
no
cause
of
action."
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
three
of
the
judges
said,
"go
back
and
dismiss
the
case
and
the
complaint
because
you
failed
to
state
a
cause
of
action."
three
other
judges
said
that
under
that
--
i
did
state
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh,
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh,
i
am
precluded.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
am
precluded
because
we
count
heads,
there's
five
--
against
five,
said
i
should
lose,
and
three
said
i
should
win.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
no.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
the
statute
of
limitations
is
right
and
my
point
is
this
is
that
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh,
i
can
amend,
i
can
amend.
the
problem
is
that
basic
rate
fundamentally
a
person
is
entitled
to
a
day
in
court.
and
this
is
a
statute
that
should
have
been
raised
by
the
defense
as
a
--
in
a
proper
manner
in
a
trial
court
so
that
i
have
an
opportunity
to
be
met
with.
so
i
could
--
if
you
look
at
the
actual
facts
like
david
never
owned
traps,
he
couldn't
physically
set
a
trap,
he'd
never
come
within
the
statute.
and
if
you
look
at
the
fact
that
there
was
no
eye
witnesses
to
this
case,
there
was
--
i
mean
no
eye
witnesses
to
the
boys
being
on
the
land
at
the
time
of
their
death
and
their
drowning.
this
present
fact
questions
under
the
statute.
what
was
james
doing
on
the
land
at
that
time?
but
the
supreme
court
by
its
very
actions
has
taken
this
statute
and
apply
it
retroactively
to
whatever
facts
were
shown
or
to
the
pleadings
and
have
barred
me
without
ever
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
have
our
day
in
court
in
relation
to
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
didn't
say
nowhere
in
the
pleadings
or
in
the
record.
is
there
any
statement
that
at
the
time
of
the
death
the
boys
were
actually
trapping
upon
the
land
of
the
michigan
sugar
company.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
21st
day
of
december.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that's
right.
but
as
i
--
my
answer
to
you
mr.
justice
fortas
is
this.
is
that
first
of
all,
if
i
had
been
met
with
the
statute
i
could've
distinguished
the
--
at
least
what
david
was
doing
as
compared
to
what
james
was
doing
out
of
--
there'd
been
constructive
effort
made
but
in
addition
to
that
you're
reading
what
--
in
interpreting
the
--
my
declaration,
three
of
the
judges
said
that
i
state
that
they
were
trapping
on
a
land,
three
of
the
judges
say
i
don't
state
that
i
was
trapping
on
the
land.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
right.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
but
on
the
other
hand
to
come
under
the
statute
there
had
to
be
muskrat
trapping
on
that
particular
land
at
that
particular
time.
that'd
be
the
first
point
that
i'd
like
to
make.
now,
it
seems
to
me
what's
really
happened
here
is
that
when
you're
prepared
to
have
a
trial
in
a
court
it's
done
in
a
--
suppose
to
be
done
in
an
orderly
fashion.
i
presented
pleadings,
issues
and
we
set
forth
the
basis
and
had
a
trial.
the
defendant,
the
respondent,
michigan
sugar
company
put
in
a
general
denial,
pleaded
contributory
negligence
to
the
minors
and
the
parents
that
after
warning
was
given
not
to
use
the
premises
and
that
they
had
lack
of
knowledge
that
minors
were
upon
the
premises.
we
tried
the
case
upon
those
issues
and
those
--
that
basis
and
then
what
happen
is
the
defendant
is
permitted
to
raise
a
statute
out
of
orderly
proceedings
and
what
does
he
do?
he
get
--
he
binds
the
petitioner
by
his
actions
to
his
pleadings
and
to
the
record
that
he
made
in
the
trial
court.
but
the
defendant
is
permitted
or
the
respondent,
michigan
sugar
company
was
permitted
by
the
action
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
to
revoke
every
bit
of
pleadings,
every
word
that
he
ever
uttered
said
before.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
three
of
them
said
that.
but
two
of
them
said
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
the
other
said
that
i
failed
to
prove
facts
to
take
me
outside
the
statute
and
therefore
i
entered
a
judgment
of
no
cause
of
action.
in
other
words,
i
never
was
met
with
the
statute
on
the
lower
court.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well
that's
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
right.
in
this
phraseology,
actually
the
only
thing
that
that
statute
changes
is
the
degree
of
proof,
it
doesn't
eliminate
a
cause
of
action
at
all.
now,
if
i
may
say
a
word
about
equal
protection
here.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
sure.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
if
i've
been
met
with
the
statute
in
the
lower
court,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
suppose
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
alright
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i'd
still
be
here
because
the
supreme
court
by
its
very
action
would
have
been
depriving
me
of
my
day
in
court
because
this
is
what
i'm
complaining
about.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
relied
on
it
all
and
then
so
can
bound
me
by
a
record
and
bound
me
by
a
pleading
relieving
the
defendant
from
or
the
michigan
sugar
company
completely
from
their
--
every
word
they
ever
uttered
and
then
to
my
complete
surprise
dismiss
the
case.
i
mean,
if
they
sent
it
back
for
new
trial
i
could
understand.
i'd
have
a
chance
to
show
that
david
wasn't
trapping
and
that
if
james
was,
that's
a
fact
question
because
nobody
saw
them
at
the
time
they
died.
and
--
but
now
let's
go
on
to
this
question
of
the
equal
protection,
the
--
under
the
--
many
times
i
just
said
your
passed
statutes,
they
don't
really
change
laws.
an
adult
trespasser
in
the
state
of
michigan
before
this
statute
was
passed
could
recover
against
a
landowner
only
for
gross
negligence
or
willful
or
wanton
misconduct.
on
the
other
hand
under
the
common
law
of
michigan
as
developed
by
the
(inaudible)
case
in
which
at
least
40
states
in
the
union
have
adopted
the
theory
of
the
protection
of
the
minor.
we
have
in
the
common
law
of
michigan
that
provides
that
if
a
child
because
of
his
immature
years
goes
upon
the
land
of
another
that
there
can
be
a
recovery
for
ordinary
negligence
upon
a
showing
that
the
landowner
has
knowledge
or
should
know
that
the
children
are
there
and
he
maintains
a
dangerous
condition.
and
this
doctrine
was
enunciated
even
by
this
court
under
the
attractive
nuisance
doctrine
beginning
with
a
turntable
case.
now,
the
effect
of
the
supreme
court's
interpretation
by
applying
this
statute
to
these
two
immature
children
is
saying
that
as
to
a
child
the
only
effect
the
statute
has
is
to
a
child.
the
only
effect
it
has
is
to
the
immature
child
that
it
discriminates
against
the
immature
child
in
relation
to
the
other
immature
child
who
was
upon
the
property.
in
other
words
if
in
fact
one
boy
had
a
slingshot
to
go
hunting
with
or
a
fishing
pole
to
go
fishing
with
and
he
took
a
friend
along
with
him
and
they
both
drowned
under
identical
circumstances
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
time.
the
little
boy
with
the
fishing
pole
cannot
get
a
recovery
as
the
court
applied
this
statute
except
by
proving
gross
negligence
or
willful
or
wanton
misconduct.
but
the
other
boy
who
didn't
have
the
fishing
pole
with
him,
he
can
recover
for
ordinary
negligence
and
this
is
a
peculiar
thing
by
--
in
tradition
interpretation
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh
yes,
it's
in
the
briefs.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes,
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes,
yes.
and
the
reason
is
this
is
that
the
statute
had
never
been
--
let
me
say
a
few
words
here
about
the
question
of
the
timely
raising
of
the
federal
questions
because
somehow
opposing
counsel
has
interjected
this
in
here
saying
that
the
federal
questions
weren't
timely
raised
and
the
answer
to
that
problem
is
this
is
a
--
it
seem
to
me
beyond
reasonable
to
anticipate
that
a
supreme
court
would
act
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister
in
380
u.s.
479,
you
laid
down
the
doctrine
that
--
it's
generally
assumed
that
state
courts
and
prosecutors
will
act
in
a
constitutional
manner.
now,
the
problem
is
that
in
--
it
would
seem
futile
to
me
to
say
to
a
court
before
it
renders
a
decision,
don't
do
it
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
until
there's
an
actual
constitutional
violation
i
can't
raise
the
question.
this
statute
had
never
been
interpreted
before.
it
was
completely
out
--
raised
outside
of
a
record
and
has
a
very
serious
question,
even
the
respondent
admits
at
his
brief
on
page
24,
that's
a
very
serious
question
whether
the
court
was
even
going
to
entertain
the
statute.
then
when
the
court
accepts
the
statute
completely
out
of
procedural
order
then
in
--
applies
it
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
only
then
can
i
raise
the
federal
questions
and
i
think
that
the
case
of
saunders
versus
shaw
is
a
case
that's
directly
in
point
on
this
issue.
it
covers
both
the
issues,
timely
raising
the
federal
question
in
an
action
of
the
supreme
court
denying
you
a
day
in
court
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
and
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
he
never
raised
it
in
--
he
raised
it
in
his
brief
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
which
i
did.
and
no
--
i
beg
you
pardon,
i'm
confused
from
--
do
you
mean
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
or
this
supreme
court?
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
alright,
now
the
respondent
what?
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
don't
have
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
he
put
in
his
brief
but
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
believe
he
raised
it
in
the
supreme
court.
it
was
completely
out
of
an
orderly
procedure.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
yes.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
that
was
one
thing.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
well,
if
the
supreme
court
was
going
to
rely
on
it
and
they
had
sent
--
and
they'd
reverse
to
send
me
back
for
a
new
trial,
there
wouldn't
be
a
constitutional
infringement.
i've
never
expected
them
to
act
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
that's
--
i
couldn't
ask
him
not
to
act
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
he
asked
him
to
reverse
the
case
with
or
without
a
new
trial.
the
last
thing
i'd
expect
them
to
do
is
reverse
the
case
without
a
new
trial
where
you
never
had
an
opportunity
to
have
your
day
in
court
in
relation
to
the
trial
--
in
relation
to
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
oh,
i
didn't
have
to.
well,
first
of
all
the
object
of
a
trial
is
to
give
to
each
side
a
fair
orderly
proceeding
when
if
this
statute
had
been
raised
in
the
lower
court
by
the
respondent.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
which
they
didn't
raise
then
at
that
time
i
could
have
amended
my
pleadings
if
necessary
or
if
i
thought
it
was
necessary.
i
could
have
--
in
a
trial
of
the
case
shown
that
little
david,
age
8,
was
physically
incapable
of
trapping
and
he
never
trapped
and
he
doesn't
even
come
within
the
statute.
as
far
as
james
is
concern
while
he
own
traps
and
he
was
on
the
land
at
the
time
of
his
death
there
were
no
eye
witnesses
so
it's
a
fact
question
whether
in
fact
at
that
time
he
was
trapping.
but
i'd
never
had
this
opportunity,
it's
been
--
the
doors
been
closed
down.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
the
--
i
say
that
the
statute
--
it's
a
peculiarly
worded
statute
but
it
really
only
changes
the
degree
of
proof,
it
doesn't
eliminate
a
cause
of
action.
it
really
changes
the
degree
of
proof
and
i
say
it's
a
matter
of
defense
that
it
should
have
been
asserted
so
i
wouldn't
be
taken
by
surprise.
he
could've
waited
until
a
trial
was
all
over
then
try
to
put
a
statute
on.
say
look
instead
of
done
something
different.
the
question
is,
it's
to
--
that's
the
object
of
raising
him
so
you
have
an
opportunity
to
have
an
orderly
trial.
that's
why
he
should
have
raised
it
and
to
show
an
affirmative
--
it's
an
affirmative
defense.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
--
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i
appreciate
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
i've
--
just
like
to
say
this
that
if
i've
been
met
with
the
statute
in
the
lower
court,
had
been
brought
to
anybody's
attention
the
pleadings
could've
been
amended.
i
could've
shown
three
things,
one,
that
david
himself
owned
no
traps,
couldn't
physically
even
set
a
trap
so
he
wouldn't
--
couldn't
be
a
--
possibly
be
a
trapper
and
we
could
cover
for
ordinary
negligence
for
david.
and
as
for
james,
james
owned
traps
and
he
was
trapping.
there
was
no
eye
witnesses
when
he
died
on
that
land
at
that
time
then
it
was
a
question
whether
he
was
trapping
on
that
land
and
that
should've
been
a
jury
question.
but
in
any
event
i
could
have
gone
ahead
and
even
claimed
as
far
as
james
is
concern,
gross
negligence,
namely
that
that
they
had
such
dangerous
condition,
they
knew
that
many
people
came
upon
their
land,
a
couple
of
(inaudible)
sign
of
warning.
they
could've
prevented
this
in
showing
that
there
was
really
a
trap.
i
should've
--
had
that
opportunity,
but
again
this
illustrates
that
really
equal
protection
is
denied
to
this
children
because
why
should
two
children,
david
and
james,
why
should
david
go
on
the
land
and
be
able
because
he's
not
trapping
but
going
along
with
his
brother,
recover
for
ordinary
negligence.
and
his
brother,
who
has
a
trap
and
is
going
to
set
a
trap
on
that
land
have
to
prove
gross
negligence.
why
should
it
be
two
standards
for
two
children
dying
at
the
same
time
at
same
place
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
--
engaged
in
--
mr.
gregory
m.
pillon
and
that's
why
it's
invidious
because
applied
the
statute
as
i
said
under
the
common
law
of
michigan,
children
could
recover
for
ordinary
negligence.
when
they
applied
the
statute
for
the
little
child,
the
immature
child
when
they
say
that
he
is
the
hunter,
the
fisher,
the
trapper,
that's
in
my
opinion,
is
an
invidious
discrimination.
thank
you
kindly
for
your
attention.
