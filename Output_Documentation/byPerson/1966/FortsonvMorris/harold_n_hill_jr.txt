mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
from
georgia
and
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
of
the
northern
district
of
georgia.
i'm
sure
i
speak
for
counsel
for
all
of
the
parties
in
the
case
expressing
our
appreciation
for
the
court's
rearranging
its
calendar
and
permitting
us
to
be
here
today.
the
democratic
primary
was
held
in
georgia
on
september
14th
of
1966.
there
were
five
candidates
in
that
primary.
former
governor
ellis
arnall
run
first,
lester
g.maddox
was
second.
the
--
a
runoff
was
held
on
december
the
--
or
september
the
28th
between
lester
maddox
and
ellis
arnall.
mr.
maddox
received
54%
of
the
vote
in
that
runoff
and
mr.
arnall
46%.
howard
callaway
became
the
nominee
of
the
republican
party
by
getting
a
nomination
petition
signed
by
5%
of
the
registered
voters
which
would
be
about
90,000
signatures.
the
general
election
was
held
on
november
8th,
the
news
election
service
on
official
returns
show
that
mr.
maddox
received
in
that
election,
448,044
votes.
mr.
callaway,
449,894
votes
with
a
difference
between
them
of
1,850
votes.
mr.
arnall
and
a
write-in
campaign
which
was
sponsored
for
him
but
not
by
him
received
some
57,000
votes
or
6%,
so
that
neither
candidate
of
the
top
two
candidates
had
a
majority.
the
georgia
constitution
provides
that
when
neither
candidate
in
the
governor's
race
receives
a
majority
of
the
vote
the
georgia
general
assembly
shall
meet
in
joint
session
and
elect
from
the
two
candidates
having
received
the
highest
number
of
votes
a
governor.
on
wednesday
november
9th,
the
day
after
the
general
election,
the
morris
suit
was
filed.
it
originally
sought
to
enjoin
the
election
of
the
governor
until
the
general
assembly
could
be
reapportioned
which
was
to
take
place
not
later
than
1969.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
they
do.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
they
elect
by
a
majority
vote.
in
order
for
that
to
be
a
joint
session,
there
would
be
necessary
that
there
be
a
like
a
forum
from
each
house
president
and
then
a
majority
of
the
votes
of
the
members
present
would
be
necessary
to
elect
the
governor.
i
wouldn't
--
would
not
anticipate
that
there
would
be
many
people
absent
on
the
date.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
there
is
that
suggestion
in
the
briefs.
the
oath
only
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
they
would
support
the
nominee
of
the
democratic
party
at
the
november
8th
general
election.
that
election
is
for
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
constitution
of
georgia
says
in
this
particular
provision
that
he
shall
--
can
vote
from
the
top
two
whichever
they
maybe.
if
the
oath
models
the
court,
i
would
recommend
that
the
oath
to
be
stricken
rather
than
the
constitutional
provision
or
if
there's
any
question
about.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
your
honor
could
not
strike
from
their
minds
the
fact
that
they
are
either
democrats
or
republicans
but
that
is
a
political
matter,
i
believe,
which
this
court
has
never
gone
into.
in
the
reapportionment
cases,
no
consideration
was
given
to
how
many
democrats
or
republicans
the
reapportionment
formula
might
put
into
a
legislature.
or
this
is
an
area
of
the
so-called
thicket
i
believe
which
the
court
has
not
yet
reached
or
as
to
--
the
british
system
isn't
very
much
the
same
way
--
acknowledgely
so
that
the
majority
party
elects
the
prime
minister.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
do
not
recall.
i
do
not
believe
--
yes,
yes,
it
was.
in
the
justice
case,
it
was
mentioned.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
it's
not
referred
to
in
the
opinions.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
morris
case
now
want
not
a
reapportioned
legislature
to
elect
the
governor
but
they
seek
a
special
election
open
to
any
candidate.
the
second
day
after
the
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
certainly
no
legislature
would
be
bound
by
any
oath
to
support
the
governor
after
he
is
elected.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
principle
and
i
believe
that
by
the
same
token
he
is
not
bound
by
any
oath
to
elect
either
particular
candidate
or
to
the
governor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
record
has
not
all
been
printed.
the
two
particular
provisions
of
the
oath
which
is
the
declaration
of
candidacy
appear
as
a
part
of
the
plaintiff's
request
for
admissions
following
page
139
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
the
particular
part
of
the
oath
which
might
be
applicable
says
that,
“i'm
a
democrat
and
i
pledge
myself
to
abide
by
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
state
democratic
executive
committee
and
to
abide
by
the
results
of
said
primary
election
on
september
14,
1966”,
which
was
the
primary.
then
it
goes
on
and
says,
“i
further
pledge
myself
to
support
at
the
general
election
of
november
the
8th,
1966
all
candidates
nominated
by
the
democratic
party
of
the
state
of
georgia.”
but
the
election
of
november
the
8th
is
over
and
the
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
election
are
held
that
date,
we
submit
is
over
your
honor.
and
it's
our
position
that
this
election
by
the
general
assembly
is
a
separate
method
of
election
unrelated
to
the
general
election
which
arises
because
of
the
circumstances
of
that
general
election.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no.
the
georgia
constitution,
the
provision
here
in
issue
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
right.
the
statute
relating
the
runoffs
under
our
construction
of
the
georgia
constitution
could
not
apply
to
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
--
i'm
unable
to
make
the
assumption
because
the
georgia
constitutions
says
that
the
election
of
the
lieutenant
governor
shall
be
made
by
the
general
assembly.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
does
not
call
for
a
runoff
but
before
the
statewide
constitutional
office.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
to
those
elections
except
governor,
lieutenant
governor,
secretary
of
state,
attorney
general,
and
one
or
two
others.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
does
not
apply
to
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
senators
or
it
don't
--
would
apply
to
state
senators.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
state
--
to
the
state
legislature.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
could
apply
to
some
statewide
offices
just
as
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
it
could
be
applied
to.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
in
his
language,
no.
perhaps
in
it's
--
in
its
sense,
yes.
but
there
people
are
voting
as
voters
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
not
as
legislators.
the
people
to
have
been
elected
would
go
to
the
post
and
vote
as
citizens
but
in
an
election
by
the
general
assembly,
they
--
legislators
have
a
constitutional
obligation
to
pick
--
to
be
free
to
pick
whichever
of
the
top
two
candidates
they
feel
would
make
the
best
governor.
and
therefore,
the
oath
here
would
not
i
believe
be
applicable.
but
as
i
have
said,
if
the
oath
is
the
problem,
we
would
submit
that
the
oath
ought
to
be
struck
down
rather
than
the
constitutional
provision.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
provision
here
in
question
came
in
if
i
may
back
up
just
a
minute.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
provision
here
in
question
came
in
are
pattern
after
a
part
of
the
twelfth
amendment
adopted
in
1804.
not
patterned
after
the
electoral
college
system
but
patterned
after
the
feature
of
the
twelfth
amendment
that
shifts
the
vote
from
the
electoral
college
into
the
house.
it
came
into
provision
into
effect
of
--
in
1824
in
georgia
are
in
effect
said
before
that
the
people
had
elected
the
governor
the
legislature
had
elected
the
governor.
it
in
effect
said
that
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
so.
in
effect
said
that
the
people
are
going
to
make
the
choice
when
we
are
clear
in
our
minds
as
to
who
it
should
be,
but
when
--
we're
not
clear
when
it's
so
close
that
no
man
has
a
majority.
we
want
the
legislators
and
though
the
man
bests
the
requirements
of
the
office
best
to
select.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
in
a
sense
a
different
method
of
electing
a
governor
much
as
it
would
be
as
if
the
legislature
was
still
empowered
to
elect
the
governor
from
--
in
the
first
instance
without
having
a
popular
vote
that
gray
versus
sanders
applies
to.
when
you
have
an
election,
you
must
count
all
the
vote
--
votes
equally.
but
the
gray
versus
sanders
does
not
say
that
you
must
have
a
certain
type
of
election
and
that
you
cannot
change
systems
when
there
has
been
a
failure
to
elect
the
governor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
court
below
indicated
that
they
thought
that
a
legislature
could
elect
a
governor,
in
the
first
instance.
there
are
many
states
who
elect
many
statewide
officers
by
either
the
legislature
or
the
governor
appointee
of
maine
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
the
state
order
took
--
is
elected
by
the
georgia
general
assembly,
in
the
first
instance.maine
elects
its
secretary
of
state,
its
attorney
general,
and
it's
state
treasurer
by
the
general
assembly.
many
states
elects
various
statewide
officers
either
by
appointment
from
the
governor
or
the
election
by
the
legislature.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
right.
certainly,
the
senator
under
nineteenth
amendment
must
be
elected
by
the
people
but
that
comparable
provision
does
not
apply
to
the
governor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
if
it
were
reasonable
for
the
state
to
require
that
for
any
of
their
candidates
to
become
elected
they
must
get
two-thirds.if
that
first
premise
were
reasonable
then
i
believe
that
at
that
point
if
having
not
received
the
two-thirds,
they
could
shift
the
method.
although,
we
of
course
are
faced
with
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
attempting
to
maintain
majority
principle
of
election
and
not
a
greater
burden
on
the
candidate
in
order
to
get
elected.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it'd
be
very
difficult
i
believe
to
--
if
to
ever
get
a
governor
particularly
in
georgia
if
you
had
an
80%
requirement
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
suppose
that
the
state
might
set
a
higher
requirement
than
a
majority.
certain,
many
states
have
set
much
less
than
that.
they
have
gone
to
the
plurality
system
where
it's
conceivable
that
something
less
than
a
third
could
elect
the
governor
by
simple
plurality.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
there
are
two
other
states.
our
investigation
reveals
which
requirements
are.
the
other
states
for
one
reason
or
another
have
gone
to
the
plurality
system.
but
it's
our
feeling
that
under
the
plurality
system,
there
is
a
disfranchisement
under
gray
versus
sanders
of
all
of
those
voters
who
vote
against
the
plurality
winner.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
alright.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
between
the
top
two.
that
ever
been
in
--
the
first
instance
selected
by
the
people.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
we
would
say
further
that
even
to
this
point
is
a
part
of
the
argument
that
the
election
by
the
general
assembly
is
not
a
continuation
of
the
popular
vote
election.
now,
we
would
say
further
that
even
if
election
by
the
general
assembly
were
to
be
considered
as
a
continuation
of
the
popular
vote
election
it
would
not
be
violative
of
the
federal
constitution.
now,
the
second
suit
was
filed
on
the
second
day
after
the
election
seeking
to
enjoin
the
governor
--
election
of
the
governor
by
the
general
assembly
to
require
a
runoff
between
misters
callaway,
and
maddox.
the
three-judge
court
heard
arguments
and
rendered
its
opinion.
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
the
next
day,
application
for
stay
the
following
monday
and
that
brings
us
here.
under
georgia
codes
--
under
the
georgia
constitution
and
the
georgia
code
in
sections
which
are
not
here
in
issue,
the
official
returns
of
the
governor's
race
are
to
remain
sealed
until
the
day
after
the
general
assembly
organizes
on
january
9,
1967
under
the
code
section
40-01,
which
unfortunately
with
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs.
the
general
assembly
is
the
sole
judge
of
the
election
and
the
qualifications
of
the
governor.
under
another
provision
of
the
georgia
constitution
that
same
--
that
part
of
this
provision
but
the
part
that
has
not
been
declared
invalid,
the
general
assembly
opens
and
publishes
the
returns
under
another
code
section.
the
general
assembly
determines
all
questions
relating
to
the
returns
of
the
election
for
governor.
thus,
the
official
results
of
the
election
are
not
known
and
will
not
be
known
until
the
general
assembly
exercises
its
rights
and
powers
under
the
georgia
constitution
and
laws
which
are
not
--
have
not
been
challenged
and
have
not
been
declared
invalid.
now,
without
in
any
way
undertaking
to
any
fringe
upon
the
prerogative
of
the
general
assembly
to
open
and
canvass
those
returns
we
have
stipulated
to
this
court
in
the
interest
of
expedition
that
the
general
assembly
will
find
when
they
open
the
returns
that
no
man
has
received
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
would
hope
not
your
honor.
i
would
hope
--
mr.
harold

excuse

mr.
harold

yes.
mr.
harold

the

put
us
into
this
one
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor,
they
are
sealed.
now
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
entered
into
a
stipulation
with
counsel
for
the
appellee's
justice
regarding
a
listing
of
telephone
and
telegraph
reports
from
the
ordinaries.
the
ordinaries
keep
a
copy
of
these
sealed
official

eleven

between

they

and

there
were

there
was

this
is
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
as
well
as
for
injunction
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
was
my
understanding
that
a
declaratory
judgment
action
if
it
was
a
properly
declaratory
judgment
action
represented
a
case
of
controversy
within
the
requirements
that
there'd
be
such
a
case
of
controversy.
but
let
me
say
that
there's
been
no
breakdown
in
the
government.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
doubt
it
would
make
it
moot
for
the
--
whoever
the
legislature
didn't
elect.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
wouldn't
be
moot
for
the
candidates.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
and
some
people,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
constitution
of
georgia
fortunately
provides
that
the
governor
elected
in
1962,
carl
sanders
shall
hold
office
for
four
years
and
until
his
successor
is
chosen
and
qualifies
so
that
we
do
have
a
governor
and
he
will,
as
indicated,
he
will
continue
to
hold
office.
if
he
should
resign
the
newly
elected
lieutenant
governor
could
take
his
place.
in
it's
a
142-year
history
this
will
be
the
first
election
of
a
governor
by
the
georgia
general
assembly.
an
attempt
to
exercise
that
power
was
made
by
--
in
1947
but
was
held
invalid
by
the
georgia
supreme
court.
there
the
georgia
supreme
court
held
the
provision
was
not
applicable
where
one
candidate
had
a
clear
majority
but
died
after
the
election
and
before
taking
office.
the
court
held
that
it
was
proper
for
the
incumbent
governor
to
hold
on
until
the
general
assembly
published
the
returns
of
the
lieutenant
governor's
race
and
for
the
newly
elected
lieutenant
governor
thereupon
became
the
acting
governor
upon
the
resignation
of
the
former
governor
ellis
arnall
at
that
time.
the
court
in
that
case,
georgia
court
held
that
the
general
assembly
could
not
elect
from
the
two
next
highest
candidates
where
the
man
who
had
have
the
majority
had
done.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
your
honor.
in
order
to
be
able
to
answer
that
question,
the
provision
of
--
that
the
general
assembly
elect
a
governor
was
in
the
constitution
of
1798
and
was
changed
in
1924.
what
the
provision
may
have
been
prior
to
1798
--i
apologized
to
the
court,
i
am
unable
to
say.
but
we
are
not
really
talking
about
a
constitution
of
1824,
georgia
has
one
of
the
most
recent
constitutions
in
the
country.
the
constitution
of
1945,
it
was
proposed
by
a
constitutional
commission
composed
of
23
appointed
members.
governor
ellis
arnall,
three
lawyers
and
the
three
laymen
appointed
by
the
governor,
the
speaker
of
the
house
who
at
that
time
was
selected
by
the
governor
and
elected
by
the
house,
and
five
members
of
the
house.
governor
arnall
was
unanimously
elected
chairman
of
that
constitutional
commission.
he
discussed
and
presided
at
the
meeting
at
which
article
v,
section
1,
paragraph
4
of
the
georgia
constitution
was
approved.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
it
was
adopted
in
1824
and
appeared
in
the
constitution
of
1861
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
1861,
1865,
68,
and
77
was
readopted
and
again
in
the
constitution
of
1945.
the
constitution
of
45
was
approved
by
the
voters
at
a
special
constitution,
an
election
held
on
august
7th
of
1945.
now,
it's
been
said
that
the
american
constitution
is
the
most
wonderful
work
ever
struck
off
at
a
given
time
by
the
brain
and
purpose
of
man
because
georgia
copied
a
part
of
that
constitution.
we
are
here
today.
if
these
were
a
copyright
infringement
case,
georgia
would
lose.but
this
is
a
constitutional
question
and
we
said
that
one
reason
that
georgia
should
win
is
because
she
copied
a
part
of
the
twelfth
amendment.
appellees
have
said
that
this
provides
an
ingenious
way
to
frustrate
the
will
of
the
people
and
that
it's
the
last
vestige
of
the
county
unit
system.
we
say
that
there
are
things
in
the
federal
constitution
which
the
states
can
copy
without
being
unconstitutional
and
that
this
is
one
of
them.
it
could
be
said
that
the
veto
power
of
the
governor
is
an
ingenious
way
of
frustrating
the
willof
the
people.
but
state
constitutions
provide
for
veto
powers
in
governors
and
so
does
the
federal
constitution
and
just
because
the
states
happened
to
copy
that
feature
of
the
federal
constitution
does
not
make
it
unconstitutional
for
the
states
to
do.
the
district
court's
order
was
based
on
what
it
called
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
gray
versus
sanders.
district
court's
decision
was
not
base
upon
alleged
malapportionment.
that
is
the
court
below
said
that
even
if
a
perfectly
--
said
that
even
a
perfectly
apportioned
legislature
could
not
elect
the
governor.
the
appellees
have
attempted
in
their
briefs
to
reargue
alleged
malapportionment.
the
georgia
general
assembly
is
not
perfectly
apportioned.
it's
been
ordered
to
apportion
itself
before
may
1,
1967.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
right.
it
is
for
the
purposes
of
conducting
business
constitutionally
approved
but
i
have
the
fear
that
the
slight
remaining
degree
of
--
in
apportionment
lurks
in
the
minds
of
some
people.
and
i
would
say
that
if
a
provisionally
apportioned
legislature
where
it
exist
--
where
its
existing
apportionment
has
been
approved
by
the
district
court
and
its
affirmed
by
this
court
is
not
able
to
elect
the
governor.
then
we
would
submit
that
this
court
should
affirm
on
that
basis.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
sufficiently
they
said
that'd
it
be
invalid.
the
--
both
houses
have
been
reapportioned
and
the
existing
time
table
caused
for
further
reapportionment.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
apportionment
plan
is
to
be
submitted
before
may
1
of
this
coming
year.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
to
allow
time
to
litigate
it
so
that
it
can
be
put
into
the
elections
of
1968
to
take
effect
in
1969.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
so
that
we
believe
that
malapportionment
either
--
ought
to
be
--
beside
the
situation
and
we'll
deal
with
gray
versus
sanders
which
was
of
course
the
county
unit
in
the
system
of
nomination
in
the
democratic
party
primary
which
was
invalidated
under
one
person,
one
vote
principle.
the
court
there
enumerated
many
of
the
things
it
was
not
dealing
with
in
gray
including
the
convention
system
of
nominating
for
the
candidates.
the
county
unit
system
was
a
method
of
waiting
votes
and
the
court
said
the
present
case
is
only
a
voting
case.
the
court
did
not,
i
do
not
believe
invalidate
the
election
of
georgia's
state
auditor
by
the
legislature
in
the
gray
decision
in
order
that
--
i
believe
invalidate
the
election
of
the
--
by
the
maine
legislature
of
its
secretary
of
state
and
attorney
general
for
the
election
by
other
state
legislatures.
the
nineteenth
amendment
says
that
senators
shall
be
elected
by
the
people
but
it
does
not
say
that
the
governor
or
state
officials
shall
be
elected
by
the
people.
gray,
as
i
understand
it
said,
that
when
you
have
an
election
of
a
state
official
by
the
people.
you
must
count
each
vote
equally.
but
gray
did
not
say
that
a
state
must
always
elect
every
state
official
by
statewide
election.
we
do
not
believe
that
gray
invalidated
any
election
methods
or
systems
where
there's
no
waiting
of
the
votes
of
the
people.
in
fortson
versus
dorsey
involving
the
validity
of
multimember
senatorial
districts,
this
court
declined
to
apply
gray
in
an
election
system
matter
because
there
the
question
was
whether
it
was
to
have
multimember
districts
or
subdivided
districts
being
a
method
of
election
rather
than
a
vote
counting
case.
the
court
also
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
a
reapportionment
case
said
that
gray
was
not
dispositive
in
cases
involving
legislative
systems.
in
gray,
the
court
said
that
once
the
class
of
voters
is
chosen,
their
qualification
specified,
we
see
no
constitutional
way
by
which
equality
of
voting
power
maybe
evaded.
the
voters
of
georgia
before
thisproblem
arose
chose
to
close
as
of
the
november
8th
general
election.
the
class
of
voters
entitled
to
vote
for
the
office
of
governor.
they
chose
to
terminate
their
own
qualifications
to
vote
under
the
limits
--
the
circumstances
existing
here.
as
was
said
in
gray,
states
can
within
limits
specify
the
qualifications
of
voters
in
both
state
and
federal
elections.
the
constitution
indeed
makes
voter
qualifications
rest
on
state
law
even
in
federal
elections.
the
election
of
a
governor
by
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
under
the
limited
circumstances
prescribed
by
the
georgia
constitution
is
not
a
continuation
of
the
popular
vote
process
but
is
a
separate
method
of
election
when
the
voters
have
not
given
any
candidate
a
majority.
the
state
has
specified
the
qualifications
of
the
persons
eligible
to
vote.they
are
the
legislators.
even
if
this
is
a
continuation
of
the
popular
vote
process
we
submit
that
gray
versus
sanders
does
not
prohibit
it.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
believe
not
your
honor,
because
it
simply
said,
the
november
8th
general
election
and
it
would
apply
to
a
man
as
a
candidate
and
nominee
and
not
after
he
had
taken
the
oath
of
office
as
a
legislator.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
the
--
one
of
the
issues
certainly.
after
an
election
and
the
counting
of
the
votes,
the
losers'
votes
count
for
nothing
even
under
gray.
only
the
winners'
votes
count.
it
happened
this
year
in
georgia
that
there
was
no
winner.
the
state
constitution
provides
a
different
method
for
selecting
a
governor
when
there
is
no
winner.
the
extension
of
gray
into
matters
of
this
type
could
lead
to
a
requirement
that
legislation
must
be
adopted
by
referendum.
if
the
voting
equality
principle
of
gray
is
applied
to
a
state
legislature
then
the
guarantee
of
a
republican
form
of
government
is
to
a
certain
extent.
certainly,
we
can
--
gray
versus
sanders
was
based
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
there
is
we
submit
no
unequal
protection
in
the
subject
provision
of
georgia's
constitution.
it
applies
equally
to
all.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
first
say
what
my
understanding
of
a
viva
voce
is
in
response
to
the
question
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
it's
--
i
believe
a
voice
vote
but
it's
not
one
of
these
situations
where
the
chair
calls
for
all
the
eyes
and
amaze.
it
will
be
a
roll
call
vote
by
name
and
each
man's
vote
will
--
he'll
have
to
get
up
and
say,
for
one
candidate
or
for
the
other
are
present
and
it's
not
as
its
been
suggested
in
the
brief
that
nobody
would
ever
know
how
their
representative
voted
on
this
question.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
the
constitutional
provision
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
fortas
that
existed
in
georgia
prior
to
1798
reminded
me
of
the
one
that
existed
in
maine
up
until
1962
which
was
that
if
no
candidate
received
a
plurality
of
all
the
votes
returned
that
the
house
of
representatives
would
choose
two
from
the
top
four
and
send
it
to
the
senate.
and
the
senate
would
choose
one
of
those
two
men
to
become
the
governor
and
if
the
senate
tied
and
the
president
of
the
senate
would
select
the
governor
that's
one
man,
one
vote.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
situation
with
respect
to
tie
votes
i
submit
is
not
as
remote
or
far
off
from
this
case
as
the
appellees
would
like
in
may
in
1962
out
of
over
--
almost
300,000
votes
casts
the
difference
between
the
republican
and
democratic
nominee
for
the
office
of
governor
was
only
483
votes.
in
rhode
island
for
the
offices
of
governor
in
1962,
the
difference
was
only
398
votes.
in
minnesota,
in
1962,
the
difference
was
only
91
votes.
in
texas
in
a
senatorial
election
in
1948,
the
difference
was
only
87
votes
and
georgia's
experience
has
been
that
if
a
problem
can
arise
it
will
arise.
the
appellees
--
morris
complained
now
of
an
alleged
republican
crossover
in
the
democratic
primary.
now
georgia
has
open
primaries,
the
republicans
could
not
vote
in
the
runoff
democratic
primary.
any
such
question
as
that
should
have
been
raised
not
after
the
general
election
but
after
the
primary
but
they
used
that
now
as
the
basis
to
seeking
to
avoid
the
november
8
general
election
to
get
a
special
election.
they
say
that
the
public
was
misled
or
there
were
news
articles
in
the
newspapers
predicting
the
filing
of
these
suits.
there
were
lawyers
stating
in
the
newspapers
that
the
general
assembly
could
not
elect
the
governor.
the
voters
were
not
misled.
they
just
voted
knowing
that
this
case
would
be
one
day
in
this
court.
where
there
is
to
be
a
special
election
followed
by
a
runoff
some
voters
are
inclined
to
cast
protest
votes
in
the
original
election
on
the
assumption
that
they
will
have
another
opportunity
to
make
their
votes
count.
if
a
special
elections
were
to
be
held
in
georgia,
prior
experience
to
this
year
already
indicates
that
no
candidate
would
receive
a
majority
and
a
runoff
from
that
special
election
would
be
required.
and
then
we
come
to
the
problem
of
write-in
a
runoff
which
is
what
the
appellees
morris
--
they
want
a
runoff
but
no
write-ins.
now
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
excuse
me,
in
the
appellee's
injustice
case.
the
case
of
gray
versus
sanders
did
not
deal
with
the
convention
system
of
nomination.
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
feel
that
gray
versus
sanders
did
not
deal
with
different
systems
of
election,
methods
of
election
such
as
a
different
method
of
election
by
the
general
assembly.
each
said
that
each
voter's
vote
is
entitled
to
be
counted
and
to
be
counted
once.
but
it
did
not
say
that
it
was
entitled
to
be
counted
again
and
again.
the
provisions
which
i
referred
to
earlier
which
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
as
being
points
about
case
of
controversy
were
mentioned
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
quickie
runoff
which
the
appellee's
justice
want
is
simply
not
possible
unless
we're
going
to
throw
down
all
of
these
provisions
which
say
the
general
assembly
shall
be
the
sole
judge.
they
open
the
returns.
they're
kept
sealed
until
they
meet
and
so
on.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
was
i
believe
pretty
much
the
situation
in
fortson
v.
toombs.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
court
said,
back
to
the
court
below
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no
action
has
been
taken
to
my
knowledge
in
the
court
below
since
it
was
remanded.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
lower
court
in
this
instance
was
the
only
one
to
my
knowledge
that
said
that
there
were
certain
things
a
legislature
could
not
do.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
what?
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
because
it
would
have
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
think
so
because
of
two
--
it
would
affect
basic
rights.
a
law
might
be
passed
imposing
capital
punishment
of
their
basic
right.
the
georgia
general
assembly
must
spend
the
money.
it
will
spend
in
the
next
appropriate
shortly
and
budget
a
$1,600,000,000.00.
now,
this
is
--
that's
more
money
than
the
governor's
worth
maybe.
but
they
can
spend
that
money
eventhough
they
are
--
haven't
met
the
time
table.
they
have
been
approved
on
their
apportionment
as
it
exists
now.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
we
would
think
that
a
new
constitution
could
have
been
proposed.
we
argued
that
it
could
have
been
proposed
and
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
because
the
court
below
has
said
that
these
cases
bring
into
focus.
the
question
of
gearing
georgia's
constitution
to
update
its
federal
constitutional
concepts
and
counsel
for
appellee
justice
has
referred
to
this
as
being
an
antiquated
constitution
from
1945.
he
has
indicated
that
had
the
1964
constitution
been
voted
on
then
the
voters
would
have
had
a
runoff.
i
would
point
out
that
it
was
my
very
good
friend
mr.
bondurant
counsel
for
justice,
who
prevented
in
that
law
suit
georgia
from
voting
on
the
64
constitution.
and
so
georgia
has
been
in
the
intolerable
position
of
not
being
able
to
vote
on
a
new
constitution
and
having
its
own
--
existing
constitution
classified
as
adequate
and
updated.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
there
were
quite
a
few
lawyers
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
my
immediate
reaction
to
that
would
that
it
would
invalid
on
the
gray
versus
sanders
because
it
is
a
waiting
of
the
vote
at
some
point
arising
out
of
the
same
election.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no.
i
believe
that's
the
basis
that
i
distinguished
my
answer
to
this
question
is
that
an
election
by
the
general
assembly
is
a
separate
part
and
the
waiting
it
does
not
exist
in
the
separate
feature.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well,
in
the
question
post
it
would
be
that
the
voter's
vote
and
if
there's
no
majority
then
you
take
those
same
votes
and
wait
them
on
some
sort
of
county
unit
basis
and
get
the
governor
out
of
that
election.
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
if
that
were
the
legal
requirement
that
in
the
election
by
the
general
assembly
the
vote
of
the
legislators
was
waiting.
i
think
that
gray
versus
sanders
would
apply.
well,
that
simply
is
not
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
only
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
republican
representative
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
but
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
difference
as
i
would
understand
it
from
the
post
hypothetical
situation
is
that
these
legislators
are
not
pledged
or
obligated
by
law
to
vote
for
either
one
of
the
two
candidates
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
which
a
county
unit
system
would
impose
upon
them.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
they
are
free
to
select
the
one
in
their
view
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
so
long
as
it
didn't
violate
the
federal
constitution,
that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
kentucky
does
that,
this
is
not
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
think
not.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
think
not
but
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
kentucky
system
because
in
effect
what
the
people
have
said,
“we
must
have
a
governor.
we
must
have
continuity
in
executive
leadership
that
it's
more
important
for
us
to
have
a
governor
than
to
vote
on
him
everytime.”
and
in
unusual
circumstances
where
the
governor
and
lieutenant
governor
die
or
something
of
that
type
that
we'd
rather
have
a
man
exercise
the
responsibilities
of
the
office
of
the
chief
executive
even
though
he's
the
speaker
of
the
house
was
--
who
was
not
elected
by
popular
vote.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
sir,
i'm
not.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well,
look
at
the
situation,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
in
now.
a
runoff
is
being
asked
for
by
the
appellees'
justice,
a
runoff
not
counting
the
write-in
votes.
now,
if
gray
versus
sanders
applies
to
every
election
it
must
apply
to
runoff
elections.and
if
gray
versus
sanders
does
not
apply
to
every
election
as
they
suggested
it
does
not,
how
can
they
argue
that
it
applies
to
an
election
by
the
georgia
general
assembly?
if
gray
does
not
require
that
counting
of
right
in
votes
in
a
runoff
election
there
is
inequality
in
voting
in
that
election.
a
discounting
of
voting
and
the
reason
for
its
inapplicability
in
a
runoff
election
is
that
a
runoff
is
a
separate
stage
of
an
election
to
which
gray
is
not
applicable.
now,
if
gray
does
not
apply
to
the
separate
runoff
stage
of
the
election,
how
can
it
be
argued
that
gray
applies
to
the
separate
general
assembly
stage
of
the
election?
if
we
assume
for
a
moment
that
gray
permits
the
discounting
of
runoff
votes
and
as
--
an
election,
we
still
have
a
problem
with
whether
the
georgia
constitution
permits
the
discounting
of
write-in
votes
in
a
runoff
election.
on
the
other
hand
it
could
be
contended
that
in
its
basic
concept
gray
prohibits
the
plurality
system
of
election.
on
the
ground
that
where
public
officials
are
elected
by
a
simple
plurality
vote.
vote
cast
against
the
plurality
winner
which
constitute
a
majority
are
unconstitutionally
diluted.
so
that
if
gray
be
extended
into
this
area
and
goes
both
ways
it
would
undo
the
majority
system
of
election
and
might
at
the
same
time
undo
the
plurality
system
of
election
and
we
submit
that
its
application
is
to
the
election
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
from
georgia
and
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
of
the
northern
district
of
georgia.
i'm
sure
i
speak
for
counsel
for
all
of
the
parties
in
the
case
expressing
our
appreciation
for
the
court's
rearranging
its
calendar
and
permitting
us
to
be
here
today.
the
democratic
primary
was
held
in
georgia
on
september
14th
of
1966.
there
were
five
candidates
in
that
primary.
former
governor
ellis
arnall
run
first,
lester
g.maddox
was
second.
the
--
a
runoff
was
held
on
december
the
--
or
september
the
28th
between
lester
maddox
and
ellis
arnall.
mr.
maddox
received
54%
of
the
vote
in
that
runoff
and
mr.
arnall
46%.
howard
callaway
became
the
nominee
of
the
republican
party
by
getting
a
nomination
petition
signed
by
5%
of
the
registered
voters
which
would
be
about
90,000
signatures.
the
general
election
was
held
on
november
8th,
the
news
election
service
on
official
returns
show
that
mr.
maddox
received
in
that
election,
448,044
votes.
mr.
callaway,
449,894
votes
with
a
difference
between
them
of
1,850
votes.
mr.
arnall
and
a
write-in
campaign
which
was
sponsored
for
him
but
not
by
him
received
some
57,000
votes
or
6%,
so
that
neither
candidate
of
the
top
two
candidates
had
a
majority.
the
georgia
constitution
provides
that
when
neither
candidate
in
the
governor's
race
receives
a
majority
of
the
vote
the
georgia
general
assembly
shall
meet
in
joint
session
and
elect
from
the
two
candidates
having
received
the
highest
number
of
votes
a
governor.
on
wednesday
november
9th,
the
day
after
the
general
election,
the
morris
suit
was
filed.
it
originally
sought
to
enjoin
the
election
of
the
governor
until
the
general
assembly
could
be
reapportioned
which
was
to
take
place
not
later
than
1969.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
they
do.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
they
elect
by
a
majority
vote.
in
order
for
that
to
be
a
joint
session,
there
would
be
necessary
that
there
be
a
like
a
forum
from
each
house
president
and
then
a
majority
of
the
votes
of
the
members
present
would
be
necessary
to
elect
the
governor.
i
wouldn't
--
would
not
anticipate
that
there
would
be
many
people
absent
on
the
date.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
there
is
that
suggestion
in
the
briefs.
the
oath
only
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
they
would
support
the
nominee
of
the
democratic
party
at
the
november
8th
general
election.
that
election
is
for
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
constitution
of
georgia
says
in
this
particular
provision
that
he
shall
--
can
vote
from
the
top
two
whichever
they
maybe.
if
the
oath
models
the
court,
i
would
recommend
that
the
oath
to
be
stricken
rather
than
the
constitutional
provision
or
if
there's
any
question
about.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
your
honor
could
not
strike
from
their
minds
the
fact
that
they
are
either
democrats
or
republicans
but
that
is
a
political
matter,
i
believe,
which
this
court
has
never
gone
into.
in
the
reapportionment
cases,
no
consideration
was
given
to
how
many
democrats
or
republicans
the
reapportionment
formula
might
put
into
a
legislature.
or
this
is
an
area
of
the
so-called
thicket
i
believe
which
the
court
has
not
yet
reached
or
as
to
--
the
british
system
isn't
very
much
the
same
way
--
acknowledgely
so
that
the
majority
party
elects
the
prime
minister.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
do
not
recall.
i
do
not
believe
--
yes,
yes,
it
was.
in
the
justice
case,
it
was
mentioned.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
it's
not
referred
to
in
the
opinions.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
morris
case
now
want
not
a
reapportioned
legislature
to
elect
the
governor
but
they
seek
a
special
election
open
to
any
candidate.
the
second
day
after
the
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
certainly
no
legislature
would
be
bound
by
any
oath
to
support
the
governor
after
he
is
elected.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
principle
and
i
believe
that
by
the
same
token
he
is
not
bound
by
any
oath
to
elect
either
particular
candidate
or
to
the
governor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
record
has
not
all
been
printed.
the
two
particular
provisions
of
the
oath
which
is
the
declaration
of
candidacy
appear
as
a
part
of
the
plaintiff's
request
for
admissions
following
page
139
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
the
particular
part
of
the
oath
which
might
be
applicable
says
that,
“i'm
a
democrat
and
i
pledge
myself
to
abide
by
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
state
democratic
executive
committee
and
to
abide
by
the
results
of
said
primary
election
on
september
14,
1966”,
which
was
the
primary.
then
it
goes
on
and
says,
“i
further
pledge
myself
to
support
at
the
general
election
of
november
the
8th,
1966
all
candidates
nominated
by
the
democratic
party
of
the
state
of
georgia.”
but
the
election
of
november
the
8th
is
over
and
the
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
election
are
held
that
date,
we
submit
is
over
your
honor.
and
it's
our
position
that
this
election
by
the
general
assembly
is
a
separate
method
of
election
unrelated
to
the
general
election
which
arises
because
of
the
circumstances
of
that
general
election.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no.
the
georgia
constitution,
the
provision
here
in
issue
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
right.
the
statute
relating
the
runoffs
under
our
construction
of
the
georgia
constitution
could
not
apply
to
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
--
i'm
unable
to
make
the
assumption
because
the
georgia
constitutions
says
that
the
election
of
the
lieutenant
governor
shall
be
made
by
the
general
assembly.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
does
not
call
for
a
runoff
but
before
the
statewide
constitutional
office.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
to
those
elections
except
governor,
lieutenant
governor,
secretary
of
state,
attorney
general,
and
one
or
two
others.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
does
not
apply
to
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
senators
or
it
don't
--
would
apply
to
state
senators.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
state
--
to
the
state
legislature.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
could
apply
to
some
statewide
offices
just
as
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
it
could
be
applied
to.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
in
his
language,
no.
perhaps
in
it's
--
in
its
sense,
yes.
but
there
people
are
voting
as
voters
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
not
as
legislators.
the
people
to
have
been
elected
would
go
to
the
post
and
vote
as
citizens
but
in
an
election
by
the
general
assembly,
they
--
legislators
have
a
constitutional
obligation
to
pick
--
to
be
free
to
pick
whichever
of
the
top
two
candidates
they
feel
would
make
the
best
governor.
and
therefore,
the
oath
here
would
not
i
believe
be
applicable.
but
as
i
have
said,
if
the
oath
is
the
problem,
we
would
submit
that
the
oath
ought
to
be
struck
down
rather
than
the
constitutional
provision.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
provision
here
in
question
came
in
if
i
may
back
up
just
a
minute.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
provision
here
in
question
came
in
are
pattern
after
a
part
of
the
twelfth
amendment
adopted
in
1804.
not
patterned
after
the
electoral
college
system
but
patterned
after
the
feature
of
the
twelfth
amendment
that
shifts
the
vote
from
the
electoral
college
into
the
house.
it
came
into
provision
into
effect
of
--
in
1824
in
georgia
are
in
effect
said
before
that
the
people
had
elected
the
governor
the
legislature
had
elected
the
governor.
it
in
effect
said
that
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
so.
in
effect
said
that
the
people
are
going
to
make
the
choice
when
we
are
clear
in
our
minds
as
to
who
it
should
be,
but
when
--
we're
not
clear
when
it's
so
close
that
no
man
has
a
majority.
we
want
the
legislators
and
though
the
man
bests
the
requirements
of
the
office
best
to
select.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
in
a
sense
a
different
method
of
electing
a
governor
much
as
it
would
be
as
if
the
legislature
was
still
empowered
to
elect
the
governor
from
--
in
the
first
instance
without
having
a
popular
vote
that
gray
versus
sanders
applies
to.
when
you
have
an
election,
you
must
count
all
the
vote
--
votes
equally.
but
the
gray
versus
sanders
does
not
say
that
you
must
have
a
certain
type
of
election
and
that
you
cannot
change
systems
when
there
has
been
a
failure
to
elect
the
governor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
court
below
indicated
that
they
thought
that
a
legislature
could
elect
a
governor,
in
the
first
instance.
there
are
many
states
who
elect
many
statewide
officers
by
either
the
legislature
or
the
governor
appointee
of
maine
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
the
state
order
took
--
is
elected
by
the
georgia
general
assembly,
in
the
first
instance.maine
elects
its
secretary
of
state,
its
attorney
general,
and
it's
state
treasurer
by
the
general
assembly.
many
states
elects
various
statewide
officers
either
by
appointment
from
the
governor
or
the
election
by
the
legislature.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
right.
certainly,
the
senator
under
nineteenth
amendment
must
be
elected
by
the
people
but
that
comparable
provision
does
not
apply
to
the
governor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
if
it
were
reasonable
for
the
state
to
require
that
for
any
of
their
candidates
to
become
elected
they
must
get
two-thirds.if
that
first
premise
were
reasonable
then
i
believe
that
at
that
point
if
having
not
received
the
two-thirds,
they
could
shift
the
method.
although,
we
of
course
are
faced
with
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
attempting
to
maintain
majority
principle
of
election
and
not
a
greater
burden
on
the
candidate
in
order
to
get
elected.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it'd
be
very
difficult
i
believe
to
--
if
to
ever
get
a
governor
particularly
in
georgia
if
you
had
an
80%
requirement
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
suppose
that
the
state
might
set
a
higher
requirement
than
a
majority.
certain,
many
states
have
set
much
less
than
that.
they
have
gone
to
the
plurality
system
where
it's
conceivable
that
something
less
than
a
third
could
elect
the
governor
by
simple
plurality.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
there
are
two
other
states.
our
investigation
reveals
which
requirements
are.
the
other
states
for
one
reason
or
another
have
gone
to
the
plurality
system.
but
it's
our
feeling
that
under
the
plurality
system,
there
is
a
disfranchisement
under
gray
versus
sanders
of
all
of
those
voters
who
vote
against
the
plurality
winner.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
alright.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
between
the
top
two.
that
ever
been
in
--
the
first
instance
selected
by
the
people.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
we
would
say
further
that
even
to
this
point
is
a
part
of
the
argument
that
the
election
by
the
general
assembly
is
not
a
continuation
of
the
popular
vote
election.
now,
we
would
say
further
that
even
if
election
by
the
general
assembly
were
to
be
considered
as
a
continuation
of
the
popular
vote
election
it
would
not
be
violative
of
the
federal
constitution.
now,
the
second
suit
was
filed
on
the
second
day
after
the
election
seeking
to
enjoin
the
governor
--
election
of
the
governor
by
the
general
assembly
to
require
a
runoff
between
misters
callaway,
and
maddox.
the
three-judge
court
heard
arguments
and
rendered
its
opinion.
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
the
next
day,
application
for
stay
the
following
monday
and
that
brings
us
here.
under
georgia
codes
--
under
the
georgia
constitution
and
the
georgia
code
in
sections
which
are
not
here
in
issue,
the
official
returns
of
the
governor's
race
are
to
remain
sealed
until
the
day
after
the
general
assembly
organizes
on
january
9,
1967
under
the
code
section
40-01,
which
unfortunately
with
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs.
the
general
assembly
is
the
sole
judge
of
the
election
and
the
qualifications
of
the
governor.
under
another
provision
of
the
georgia
constitution
that
same
--
that
part
of
this
provision
but
the
part
that
has
not
been
declared
invalid,
the
general
assembly
opens
and
publishes
the
returns
under
another
code
section.
the
general
assembly
determines
all
questions
relating
to
the
returns
of
the
election
for
governor.
thus,
the
official
results
of
the
election
are
not
known
and
will
not
be
known
until
the
general
assembly
exercises
its
rights
and
powers
under
the
georgia
constitution
and
laws
which
are
not
--
have
not
been
challenged
and
have
not
been
declared
invalid.
now,
without
in
any
way
undertaking
to
any
fringe
upon
the
prerogative
of
the
general
assembly
to
open
and
canvass
those
returns
we
have
stipulated
to
this
court
in
the
interest
of
expedition
that
the
general
assembly
will
find
when
they
open
the
returns
that
no
man
has
received
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
would
hope
not
your
honor.
i
would
hope
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
court
below
put
us
into
this
one
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor,
they
are
sealed.
now
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
entered
into
a
stipulation
with
counsel
for
the
appellee's
justice
regarding
a
listing
of
telephone
and
telegraph
reports
from
the
ordinaries.
the
ordinaries
keep
a
copy
of
these
sealed
official
returns.
eleven
counties
have
not
responded.
a
123
counties
show
variances
between
what
they
said
they
sent
to
the
state
in
sealed
envelops
and
what
the
new
service
election
report
show.
there
were
actually
only
25
where
there
was
an
agreement
between
what
the
ordinary
said
their
vote
was
and
what
the
news
election
said
the
vote
was.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
newspaper
results
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
new
--
election
news
service
from
post
of
upi,
ap
and
the
three
tv
and
a
radio
network.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
this
is
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
as
well
as
for
injunction
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
was
my
understanding
that
a
declaratory
judgment
action
if
it
was
a
properly
declaratory
judgment
action
represented
a
case
of
controversy
within
the
requirements
that
there'd
be
such
a
case
of
controversy.
but
let
me
say
that
there's
been
no
breakdown
in
the
government.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
doubt
it
would
make
it
moot
for
the
--
whoever
the
legislature
didn't
elect.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
it
wouldn't
be
moot
for
the
candidates.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
and
some
people,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
constitution
of
georgia
fortunately
provides
that
the
governor
elected
in
1962,
carl
sanders
shall
hold
office
for
four
years
and
until
his
successor
is
chosen
and
qualifies
so
that
we
do
have
a
governor
and
he
will,
as
indicated,
he
will
continue
to
hold
office.
if
he
should
resign
the
newly
elected
lieutenant
governor
could
take
his
place.
in
it's
a
142-year
history
this
will
be
the
first
election
of
a
governor
by
the
georgia
general
assembly.
an
attempt
to
exercise
that
power
was
made
by
--
in
1947
but
was
held
invalid
by
the
georgia
supreme
court.
there
the
georgia
supreme
court
held
the
provision
was
not
applicable
where
one
candidate
had
a
clear
majority
but
died
after
the
election
and
before
taking
office.
the
court
held
that
it
was
proper
for
the
incumbent
governor
to
hold
on
until
the
general
assembly
published
the
returns
of
the
lieutenant
governor's
race
and
for
the
newly
elected
lieutenant
governor
thereupon
became
the
acting
governor
upon
the
resignation
of
the
former
governor
ellis
arnall
at
that
time.
the
court
in
that
case,
georgia
court
held
that
the
general
assembly
could
not
elect
from
the
two
next
highest
candidates
where
the
man
who
had
have
the
majority
had
done.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
your
honor.
in
order
to
be
able
to
answer
that
question,
the
provision
of
--
that
the
general
assembly
elect
a
governor
was
in
the
constitution
of
1798
and
was
changed
in
1924.
what
the
provision
may
have
been
prior
to
1798
--i
apologized
to
the
court,
i
am
unable
to
say.
but
we
are
not
really
talking
about
a
constitution
of
1824,
georgia
has
one
of
the
most
recent
constitutions
in
the
country.
the
constitution
of
1945,
it
was
proposed
by
a
constitutional
commission
composed
of
23
appointed
members.
governor
ellis
arnall,
three
lawyers
and
the
three
laymen
appointed
by
the
governor,
the
speaker
of
the
house
who
at
that
time
was
selected
by
the
governor
and
elected
by
the
house,
and
five
members
of
the
house.
governor
arnall
was
unanimously
elected
chairman
of
that
constitutional
commission.
he
discussed
and
presided
at
the
meeting
at
which
article
v,
section
1,
paragraph
4
of
the
georgia
constitution
was
approved.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
it
was
adopted
in
1824
and
appeared
in
the
constitution
of
1861
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
1861,
1865,
68,
and
77
was
readopted
and
again
in
the
constitution
of
1945.
the
constitution
of
45
was
approved
by
the
voters
at
a
special
constitution,
an
election
held
on
august
7th
of
1945.
now,
it's
been
said
that
the
american
constitution
is
the
most
wonderful
work
ever
struck
off
at
a
given
time
by
the
brain
and
purpose
of
man
because
georgia
copied
a
part
of
that
constitution.
we
are
here
today.
if
these
were
a
copyright
infringement
case,
georgia
would
lose.but
this
is
a
constitutional
question
and
we
said
that
one
reason
that
georgia
should
win
is
because
she
copied
a
part
of
the
twelfth
amendment.
appellees
have
said
that
this
provides
an
ingenious
way
to
frustrate
the
will
of
the
people
and
that
it's
the
last
vestige
of
the
county
unit
system.
we
say
that
there
are
things
in
the
federal
constitution
which
the
states
can
copy
without
being
unconstitutional
and
that
this
is
one
of
them.
it
could
be
said
that
the
veto
power
of
the
governor
is
an
ingenious
way
of
frustrating
the
willof
the
people.
but
state
constitutions
provide
for
veto
powers
in
governors
and
so
does
the
federal
constitution
and
just
because
the
states
happened
to
copy
that
feature
of
the
federal
constitution
does
not
make
it
unconstitutional
for
the
states
to
do.
the
district
court's
order
was
based
on
what
it
called
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
gray
versus
sanders.
district
court's
decision
was
not
base
upon
alleged
malapportionment.
that
is
the
court
below
said
that
even
if
a
perfectly
--
said
that
even
a
perfectly
apportioned
legislature
could
not
elect
the
governor.
the
appellees
have
attempted
in
their
briefs
to
reargue
alleged
malapportionment.
the
georgia
general
assembly
is
not
perfectly
apportioned.
it's
been
ordered
to
apportion
itself
before
may
1,
1967.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
right.
it
is
for
the
purposes
of
conducting
business
constitutionally
approved
but
i
have
the
fear
that
the
slight
remaining
degree
of
--
in
apportionment
lurks
in
the
minds
of
some
people.
and
i
would
say
that
if
a
provisionally
apportioned
legislature
where
it
exist
--
where
its
existing
apportionment
has
been
approved
by
the
district
court
and
its
affirmed
by
this
court
is
not
able
to
elect
the
governor.
then
we
would
submit
that
this
court
should
affirm
on
that
basis.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
sufficiently
they
said
that'd
it
be
invalid.
the
--
both
houses
have
been
reapportioned
and
the
existing
time
table
caused
for
further
reapportionment.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
apportionment
plan
is
to
be
submitted
before
may
1
of
this
coming
year.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
to
allow
time
to
litigate
it
so
that
it
can
be
put
into
the
elections
of
1968
to
take
effect
in
1969.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
so
that
we
believe
that
malapportionment
either
--
ought
to
be
--
beside
the
situation
and
we'll
deal
with
gray
versus
sanders
which
was
of
course
the
county
unit
in
the
system
of
nomination
in
the
democratic
party
primary
which
was
invalidated
under
one
person,
one
vote
principle.
the
court
there
enumerated
many
of
the
things
it
was
not
dealing
with
in
gray
including
the
convention
system
of
nominating
for
the
candidates.
the
county
unit
system
was
a
method
of
waiting
votes
and
the
court
said
the
present
case
is
only
a
voting
case.
the
court
did
not,
i
do
not
believe
invalidate
the
election
of
georgia's
state
auditor
by
the
legislature
in
the
gray
decision
in
order
that
--
i
believe
invalidate
the
election
of
the
--
by
the
maine
legislature
of
its
secretary
of
state
and
attorney
general
for
the
election
by
other
state
legislatures.
the
nineteenth
amendment
says
that
senators
shall
be
elected
by
the
people
but
it
does
not
say
that
the
governor
or
state
officials
shall
be
elected
by
the
people.
gray,
as
i
understand
it
said,
that
when
you
have
an
election
of
a
state
official
by
the
people.
you
must
count
each
vote
equally.
but
gray
did
not
say
that
a
state
must
always
elect
every
state
official
by
statewide
election.
we
do
not
believe
that
gray
invalidated
any
election
methods
or
systems
where
there's
no
waiting
of
the
votes
of
the
people.
in
fortson
versus
dorsey
involving
the
validity
of
multimember
senatorial
districts,
this
court
declined
to
apply
gray
in
an
election
system
matter
because
there
the
question
was
whether
it
was
to
have
multimember
districts
or
subdivided
districts
being
a
method
of
election
rather
than
a
vote
counting
case.
the
court
also
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
a
reapportionment
case
said
that
gray
was
not
dispositive
in
cases
involving
legislative
systems.
in
gray,
the
court
said
that
once
the
class
of
voters
is
chosen,
their
qualification
specified,
we
see
no
constitutional
way
by
which
equality
of
voting
power
maybe
evaded.
the
voters
of
georgia
before
thisproblem
arose
chose
to
close
as
of
the
november
8th
general
election.
the
class
of
voters
entitled
to
vote
for
the
office
of
governor.
they
chose
to
terminate
their
own
qualifications
to
vote
under
the
limits
--
the
circumstances
existing
here.
as
was
said
in
gray,
states
can
within
limits
specify
the
qualifications
of
voters
in
both
state
and
federal
elections.
the
constitution
indeed
makes
voter
qualifications
rest
on
state
law
even
in
federal
elections.
the
election
of
a
governor
by
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
under
the
limited
circumstances
prescribed
by
the
georgia
constitution
is
not
a
continuation
of
the
popular
vote
process
but
is
a
separate
method
of
election
when
the
voters
have
not
given
any
candidate
a
majority.
the
state
has
specified
the
qualifications
of
the
persons
eligible
to
vote.they
are
the
legislators.
even
if
this
is
a
continuation
of
the
popular
vote
process
we
submit
that
gray
versus
sanders
does
not
prohibit
it.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
believe
not
your
honor,
because
it
simply
said,
the
november
8th
general
election
and
it
would
apply
to
a
man
as
a
candidate
and
nominee
and
not
after
he
had
taken
the
oath
of
office
as
a
legislator.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
is
the
--
one
of
the
issues
certainly.
after
an
election
and
the
counting
of
the
votes,
the
losers'
votes
count
for
nothing
even
under
gray.
only
the
winners'
votes
count.
it
happened
this
year
in
georgia
that
there
was
no
winner.
the
state
constitution
provides
a
different
method
for
selecting
a
governor
when
there
is
no
winner.
the
extension
of
gray
into
matters
of
this
type
could
lead
to
a
requirement
that
legislation
must
be
adopted
by
referendum.
if
the
voting
equality
principle
of
gray
is
applied
to
a
state
legislature
then
the
guarantee
of
a
republican
form
of
government
is
to
a
certain
extent.
certainly,
we
can
--
gray
versus
sanders
was
based
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
there
is
we
submit
no
unequal
protection
in
the
subject
provision
of
georgia's
constitution.
it
applies
equally
to
all.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
first
say
what
my
understanding
of
a
viva
voce
is
in
response
to
the
question
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
it's
--
i
believe
a
voice
vote
but
it's
not
one
of
these
situations
where
the
chair
calls
for
all
the
eyes
and
amaze.
it
will
be
a
roll
call
vote
by
name
and
each
man's
vote
will
--
he'll
have
to
get
up
and
say,
for
one
candidate
or
for
the
other
are
present
and
it's
not
as
its
been
suggested
in
the
brief
that
nobody
would
ever
know
how
their
representative
voted
on
this
question.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
the
constitutional
provision
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
fortas
that
existed
in
georgia
prior
to
1798
reminded
me
of
the
one
that
existed
in
maine
up
until
1962
which
was
that
if
no
candidate
received
a
plurality
of
all
the
votes
returned
that
the
house
of
representatives
would
choose
two
from
the
top
four
and
send
it
to
the
senate.
and
the
senate
would
choose
one
of
those
two
men
to
become
the
governor
and
if
the
senate
tied
and
the
president
of
the
senate
would
select
the
governor
that's
one
man,
one
vote.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
situation
with
respect
to
tie
votes
i
submit
is
not
as
remote
or
far
off
from
this
case
as
the
appellees
would
like
in
may
in
1962
out
of
over
--
almost
300,000
votes
casts
the
difference
between
the
republican
and
democratic
nominee
for
the
office
of
governor
was
only
483
votes.
in
rhode
island
for
the
offices
of
governor
in
1962,
the
difference
was
only
398
votes.
in
minnesota,
in
1962,
the
difference
was
only
91
votes.
in
texas
in
a
senatorial
election
in
1948,
the
difference
was
only
87
votes
and
georgia's
experience
has
been
that
if
a
problem
can
arise
it
will
arise.
the
appellees
--
morris
complained
now
of
an
alleged
republican
crossover
in
the
democratic
primary.
now
georgia
has
open
primaries,
the
republicans
could
not
vote
in
the
runoff
democratic
primary.
any
such
question
as
that
should
have
been
raised
not
after
the
general
election
but
after
the
primary
but
they
used
that
now
as
the
basis
to
seeking
to
avoid
the
november
8
general
election
to
get
a
special
election.
they
say
that
the
public
was
misled
or
there
were
news
articles
in
the
newspapers
predicting
the
filing
of
these
suits.
there
were
lawyers
stating
in
the
newspapers
that
the
general
assembly
could
not
elect
the
governor.
the
voters
were
not
misled.
they
just
voted
knowing
that
this
case
would
be
one
day
in
this
court.
where
there
is
to
be
a
special
election
followed
by
a
runoff
some
voters
are
inclined
to
cast
protest
votes
in
the
original
election
on
the
assumption
that
they
will
have
another
opportunity
to
make
their
votes
count.
if
a
special
elections
were
to
be
held
in
georgia,
prior
experience
to
this
year
already
indicates
that
no
candidate
would
receive
a
majority
and
a
runoff
from
that
special
election
would
be
required.
and
then
we
come
to
the
problem
of
write-in
a
runoff
which
is
what
the
appellees
morris
--
they
want
a
runoff
but
no
write-ins.
now
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
excuse
me,
in
the
appellee's
injustice
case.
the
case
of
gray
versus
sanders
did
not
deal
with
the
convention
system
of
nomination.
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
feel
that
gray
versus
sanders
did
not
deal
with
different
systems
of
election,
methods
of
election
such
as
a
different
method
of
election
by
the
general
assembly.
each
said
that
each
voter's
vote
is
entitled
to
be
counted
and
to
be
counted
once.
but
it
did
not
say
that
it
was
entitled
to
be
counted
again
and
again.
the
provisions
which
i
referred
to
earlier
which
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
as
being
points
about
case
of
controversy
were
mentioned
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
quickie
runoff
which
the
appellee's
justice
want
is
simply
not
possible
unless
we're
going
to
throw
down
all
of
these
provisions
which
say
the
general
assembly
shall
be
the
sole
judge.
they
open
the
returns.
they're
kept
sealed
until
they
meet
and
so
on.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that
was
i
believe
pretty
much
the
situation
in
fortson
v.
toombs.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
court
said,
back
to
the
court
below
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no
action
has
been
taken
to
my
knowledge
in
the
court
below
since
it
was
remanded.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
lower
court
in
this
instance
was
the
only
one
to
my
knowledge
that
said
that
there
were
certain
things
a
legislature
could
not
do.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
what?
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes,
because
it
would
have
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
think
so
because
of
two
--
it
would
affect
basic
rights.
a
law
might
be
passed
imposing
capital
punishment
of
their
basic
right.
the
georgia
general
assembly
must
spend
the
money.
it
will
spend
in
the
next
appropriate
shortly
and
budget
a
$1,600,000,000.00.
now,
this
is
--
that's
more
money
than
the
governor's
worth
maybe.
but
they
can
spend
that
money
eventhough
they
are
--
haven't
met
the
time
table.
they
have
been
approved
on
their
apportionment
as
it
exists
now.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
we
would
think
that
a
new
constitution
could
have
been
proposed.
we
argued
that
it
could
have
been
proposed
and
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
because
the
court
below
has
said
that
these
cases
bring
into
focus.
the
question
of
gearing
georgia's
constitution
to
update
its
federal
constitutional
concepts
and
counsel
for
appellee
justice
has
referred
to
this
as
being
an
antiquated
constitution
from
1945.
he
has
indicated
that
had
the
1964
constitution
been
voted
on
then
the
voters
would
have
had
a
runoff.
i
would
point
out
that
it
was
my
very
good
friend
mr.
bondurant
counsel
for
justice,
who
prevented
in
that
law
suit
georgia
from
voting
on
the
64
constitution.
and
so
georgia
has
been
in
the
intolerable
position
of
not
being
able
to
vote
on
a
new
constitution
and
having
its
own
--
existing
constitution
classified
as
adequate
and
updated.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
there
were
quite
a
few
lawyers
your
honor.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
my
immediate
reaction
to
that
would
that
it
would
invalid
on
the
gray
versus
sanders
because
it
is
a
waiting
of
the
vote
at
some
point
arising
out
of
the
same
election.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no.
i
believe
that's
the
basis
that
i
distinguished
my
answer
to
this
question
is
that
an
election
by
the
general
assembly
is
a
separate
part
and
the
waiting
it
does
not
exist
in
the
separate
feature.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well,
in
the
question
post
it
would
be
that
the
voter's
vote
and
if
there's
no
majority
then
you
take
those
same
votes
and
wait
them
on
some
sort
of
county
unit
basis
and
get
the
governor
out
of
that
election.
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
if
that
were
the
legal
requirement
that
in
the
election
by
the
general
assembly
the
vote
of
the
legislators
was
waiting.
i
think
that
gray
versus
sanders
would
apply.
well,
that
simply
is
not
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
only
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
republican
representative
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
but
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
the
difference
as
i
would
understand
it
from
the
post
hypothetical
situation
is
that
these
legislators
are
not
pledged
or
obligated
by
law
to
vote
for
either
one
of
the
two
candidates
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
--
which
a
county
unit
system
would
impose
upon
them.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
they
are
free
to
select
the
one
in
their
view
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
so
long
as
it
didn't
violate
the
federal
constitution,
that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
kentucky
does
that,
this
is
not
--
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
think
not.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
i
think
not
but
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
kentucky
system
because
in
effect
what
the
people
have
said,
“we
must
have
a
governor.
we
must
have
continuity
in
executive
leadership
that
it's
more
important
for
us
to
have
a
governor
than
to
vote
on
him
everytime.”
and
in
unusual
circumstances
where
the
governor
and
lieutenant
governor
die
or
something
of
that
type
that
we'd
rather
have
a
man
exercise
the
responsibilities
of
the
office
of
the
chief
executive
even
though
he's
the
speaker
of
the
house
was
--
who
was
not
elected
by
popular
vote.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no,
sir,
i'm
not.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
no.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
n.
hill,
jr.
well,
look
at
the
situation,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
in
now.
a
runoff
is
being
asked
for
by
the
appellees'
justice,
a
runoff
not
counting
the
write-in
votes.
now,
if
gray
versus
sanders
applies
to
every
election
it
must
apply
to
runoff
elections.and
if
gray
versus
sanders
does
not
apply
to
every
election
as
they
suggested
it
does
not,
how
can
they
argue
that
it
applies
to
an
election
by
the
georgia
general
assembly?
if
gray
does
not
require
that
counting
of
right
in
votes
in
a
runoff
election
there
is
inequality
in
voting
in
that
election.
a
discounting
of
voting
and
the
reason
for
its
inapplicability
in
a
runoff
election
is
that
a
runoff
is
a
separate
stage
of
an
election
to
which
gray
is
not
applicable.
now,
if
gray
does
not
apply
to
the
separate
runoff
stage
of
the
election,
how
can
it
be
argued
that
gray
applies
to
the
separate
general
assembly
stage
of
the
election?
if
we
assume
for
a
moment
that
gray
permits
the
discounting
of
runoff
votes
and
as
--
an
election,
we
still
have
a
problem
with
whether
the
georgia
constitution
permits
the
discounting
of
write-in
votes
in
a
runoff
election.
on
the
other
hand
it
could
be
contended
that
in
its
basic
concept
gray
prohibits
the
plurality
system
of
election.
on
the
ground
that
where
public
officials
are
elected
by
a
simple
plurality
vote.
vote
cast
against
the
plurality
winner
which
constitute
a
majority
are
unconstitutionally
diluted.
so
that
if
gray
be
extended
into
this
area
and
goes
both
ways
it
would
undo
the
majority
system
of
election
and
might
at
the
same
time
undo
the
plurality
system
of
election
and
we
submit
that
its
application
is
to
the
election
--
