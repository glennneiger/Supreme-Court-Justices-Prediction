does
any

well,
aren't
they

do
we
have
a

i
don't
understand
what
the

is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

are
you
suggesting
in
light
of
our
affirmance
with
the
three-judge
order
that
this
legislature
taking
office
in
january,
is
it
constitutionally
malapportionment?
justice

because
that
had
been

brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
just
have
trouble,
you
concede
--
extricating
how
you
can
characterize
this
new

as
malapportioned
when
for
the

of
this

at

in
this
constitute
as
a
legislative
body.
we
affirmed

it
was
elected.

would
you

you
really
don't
care
then
do
you
whether
there's
a
write-in
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
if
there
is
a
write-in
then
you
have
to
have
one
election
after
another,
the
present
governor
will
be
in
office?

but
what
you
now
have
represent
the
final
figures
from
these
158
counties
together?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
hill
is
this
--
do
you
think
this
is
any
different
kind
of
a
question
that
if
some
citizens
came
in
and
the
--
wanted
to
enjoin
the
submission
of
a

constitution
to
the

and
if
you

be

did
we
set

of
a
