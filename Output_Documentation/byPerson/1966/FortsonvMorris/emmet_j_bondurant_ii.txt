mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
before
proceeding
to
the
merits
and
i
feel
we
must
meet
the
problem
raised
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
whether
we
have
in
this
court
a
case
of
controversy
on
reasonably
concrete
facts
on
which
this
court
can
act.
mr.
morgan
has
touched
on
this
question.
the
district
court
took
judicial
notice
of
a
common
public
fact
in
georgia
that
no
candidate
received
the
majority
of
the
votes
properly
casts
in
the
november
8th
general
election.
at
the
time
it
was
meeting,
this
was
a
commonly
known
fact.
further,
although
the
state
makes
this
argument
that
the
returns
are
sealed
and
cannot
be
unsealed
until
the
general
assembly
meets
by
law
34-1506
(a)
of
the
election
code
certified
copies,
identical
to
those
which
are
sealed
are
retained
in
the
office
of
the
ordinary
as
public
records
open
to
public
inspection
by
anyone
in
the
state
of
georgia.
since
that
time
because
of
the
expedition
in
which
this
case
is
handled
ourselves
representing
justice
et
al
and
the
state
have
joined
in
a
stipulation
which
has
been
presented
to
clerk's
office
in
which
we
have
obtained
on
the
basis
of
telegram
request
from
this
ordinaries
what
these
returns
showed
based
on
the
statutory
records
and
they
have
notified
us
and
from
all
the
counties,
a
148
counties
of
the
159.
we
do
not
have
with
--
just
because
of
the
practically
of
the
situation,
the
repetitive
approach
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
148
of
the
159
counties
have
notified
us.
the
remaining
11
counties,
the
--
all
public
information
indicates
casts
combined
fewer
votes
then
would
take
it
to
make
a
majority.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
notification
is
that
no
candidate
has
received
the
majority.
and
the
total
vote
cast
under
the
remaining
11
counties
from
which
we
have
not
heard
by
telegram
would
not
be
sufficient
to
give
any
candidate
the
majority
even
if
totally
added
to
his
total.
so
there
can
be
no
question.
this
situation
will
be
called
into
play
that
this
is
a
real
genuine
case
of
controversy
between
adverse
interests.
this
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
news
election
service
as
i
understand
it
justice
brennan
computed
returns
through
noon
on
friday
following
the
election
on
tuesday
and
at
the
time
when
we
were
in
the
district
court
this
was
the
most
current
information
which
we
then
have.
many
counties
have
paper
ballots
and
tallied
very
slowly.
the
discrepancies
undoubtedly
are
result
of
final
tabulations
being
completed
after
that
time,
particularly
write-in
ballots
which
in
fulton
county,
atlanta
there
were
more
than
15,000,
16,000,
20,000
which
took
a
great
period
of
time
to
tabulate.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
other
metropolitan
counties.
these
have
been
added
to
the
total
since
then
and
they
do
change
the
totals.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
as
we
understand
it
with
the
exception
of
11
counties,
these
are
according
to
the
ordinaries,
communicated
by
wired
to
us
or
by
letter
that
which
is
shown
by
the
certified
copies
which
they
maintained
by
law
in
their
respective
offices
open
to
public
inspection.
the
originals
of
which
or
duplicate
copies
of
which
have
been
sealed
and
forwarded
to
the
secretary
of
state
under
the
provisions
to
which
the
state
refers.
so
there
is
no
question
of
acting
in
a
hypothetical
confusing
or
possibly
changeable
situation
when
those
sealed
returns
opening
--
opened.
we
know
what
our
situation
is.
everyone
knows
what
it
is.
this
case
is
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
–
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
absentee
ballots
were
necessarily
excluded
from
the
news
selection
service
tabulation
and
were
counted
more
slowly
and
therefore
later,
when
their
service
terminated
on
noon
on
friday
after
the
election
on
tuesday.
as
we
understand
it,
these
absentee
ballots
are
included
in
the
certified
returns,
the
information
of
which
has
been
communicated.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
the
certified
returns
would
include
everything
necessarily
because
they
could
not
be
sealed
and
forwarded
until
all
votes
were
included.
this
case
is
as
we
suggest
not
a
representation
case.
this
is
not
reynolds
and
sims.
this
is
not
wesberry
against
sanders.
this
is
not
even
toombs
against
fortson.
this
is
the
right
of
the
people
of
georgia,
the
citizens
and
all
of
our
159
counties
to
elect
her
governor
in
a
popular
statewide
election
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis.
we
do
not
have
here
the
question
as
to
whether
had
georgia
chose
and
initially
in
1966
to
put
this
election
in
some
other
agency,
whatever
that
agency
might
be
whether
that
the
constitutionally
be
done.
we
have
the
question
of
whether
georgia
having
–
by
its
constitution
said
that
there
shall
be
a
primary
election
of
which
every
citizens
of
the
state
may
participate.
a
general
election
in
which
every
citizen
of
the
state
qualified
otherwise
may
participate
and
nearly
a
million
did
participate,
may
elect
the
governor.
changed
only
by
the
situation
created
by
georgia's
desire
to
have
a
majority
vote
for
her
governor
which
places
the
final
selection
power
in
the
general
assembly
when
no
majority
is
achieved
in
the
general
election.
this
is
the
sole
purpose
that
the
general
assembly
is
involved
in
any
degree.it
is
a
popular
election
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
it
is
in
every
other
state
except
in
the
unlikely
event
of
a
tie
vote,
a
popular
election.
it
is
the
people's
right
to
elect
their
governor.
it
has
been
in
every
state
since
before
1868
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted.
no
state
by
1868
did
as
georgia
initially
and
elected
the
governor
in
the
legislature
or
any
other
office.
it
was
a
vote
of
the
people
and
it
is
the
vote
of
the
people
in
georgia.
and
everyone
in
georgia
considers
it
such.
the
general
assembly
gets
involved
only
because
no
candidate
received
the
majority.
solely
in
the
name
of
majority
vote
to
achieve
the
strength
of
popular
support
which
majority
expresses
much
better
than
plurality
that
the
general
assembly
become
implicated
in
this
process.
and
yet,
it's
clear
the
general
assembly
will
not
represent
the
strength
of
the
majority
support.
not
merely
so
effectively
as
a
runoff.
the
ironical
and
paradoxical
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
georgia
legislative
process
at
the
time
when
the
legislature
was
far
more
malapportioned
than
we
are
today.
in
1964,
adopted
the
new
election
code
which
in
expressed
language
says,
“there
shall
be
a
runoff
in
every
elected
state
public
office
where
no
candidate
receives
the
majority.”
and
in
that
context
at
the
same
session
adopted
a
new
state
constitution,
they
proposed
a
constitution
which
would
have
repealed,
superseded
and
done
away
with
this
1824
provision
and
would
have
provided
in
expressed
terms
without
a
doubt,
without
debate,
that
this
1966
election
would
have
been
resolved
by
the
vote
of
the
people
of
georgia
in
a
runoff
election
between
the
two
highest
candidates.
there
is
no
possibility
as
mr.
justice
white
has
suggested
that
we
might
have
to
go
on
and
on
because
our
election
code
itself
says,
“that
a
runoff
shall
be
between
the
candidates
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
in
a
general
election.
we
do
not
suggest
that
write-in
votes
can
be
excluded
by
either
this
court
or
the
district
court
by
order
where
the
state
has
not
done
so.
we
suggest
instead
that
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
has
already
done
so
in
the
expressed
language
in
which
it
used
in
the
election
code
that
the
runoff
will
be
between
the
two
candidates
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes.
this
is
after
all
implicit
in
the
nature
of
a
runoff
itself.
but
the
language
was
used
--
general
assembly
has
used
is
consistently
with
the
exclusion
of
write-in
votes.
this
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
attorney
general
has
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
election
code
expresses
what
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
attempted
to
provide
in
1964
and
which
but
for
conflict
with
this
archaic
1824
provision
would
be
the
situation
prescribed
by
the
elected
representatives
in
georgia
for
election
by
the
people
in
1966.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
age
itself
is
nothing
--
is
not
wrong.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yet
in
many
other
things
which
were
not
constructional
have
been
reincorporated.
the
last
adoption
of
the
constitution
was
in
a
manner
which
the
georgia
supreme
court
later
recognized
but
was
powerless
to
remedy
was
a
matter
not
permitted
by
our
state
constitution.
it
was
proposed
as
a
single
amendment
which
that
court
said
was
not
authorized.
the
whole
package
had
to
be
separately
accepted
or
rejected.
and
the
court
said
that
we're
looking
at
it
before
it
had
been
ratified,
it
would
have
been
something
valid
but
could
not
afterwards.
so
the
idea
of
the
ratification
is
that
you
might
have
had
in
the
colorado
case
where
a
single
amendment
was
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
voters
in
every
county
of
the
state
was
not
shown
in
georgia.
the
whole
package,
the
good
and
the
bad
was
approved
in
1945
more
than
20
years
ago.
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
a
voting
rights
case.
that
the
people
of
the
georgia
do
have
a
right
conferred
by
the
georgia
constitution
to
elect
their
governor.
that
the
argument
that
this
is
a
two
step
process
or
that
some
other
process
might
apply
is
mere
sophistry.
the
here
and
now,
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
is
that
950,000
people
have
voted
in
the
general
election.
nearly
900,000
people
have
voted
twice
in
primary
elections
leading
up
to
this.
and
if
those
people
have
the
right
to
elect
their
governor
and
that
the
instrumentality
of
election
by
the
general
assembly
solely
in
the
name
of
majority
rule
is
a
device
which
deprives
these
voters
just
as
truly
as
did
the
old
unit
system
of
nomination
of
the
right
to
a
full
and
equal
voice,
having
been
selected
as
the
common
denominator
for
selection
in
that
final
election
process.
this
is
far
more
pernicious
than
that.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
predict
exactly
what's
its
purpose
was
in
1824
justice
black.
the
problem
now
is
that
the
general
assembly
grossly
unrepresentative
may
elect
in
a
manner
not
consistent
with
the
prior
choices
in
the
same
election
expressed
by
the
people
between
the
candidates
put
before
the
general
assembly.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
we
take
it
on
two
basis.first
is
on
the
initial
basis
of
the
county
unit
system
itself
as
you
will
recall
the
county
unit
system.
and
the
county
unit
votes
were
distributed
in
gubernatorial
primary
elections
based
on
representation
in
the
georgia
general
assembly
which
was
apportioned
on
the
old
321
system.
you
had
two
unit
votes
for
each
sits
you
had
in
the
house.
if
georgia
hears
merely
by
a
legislative
of
election
substituted,
animate
legislators
from
inanimate
objects.
in
the
unit
system
you
at
least
had
the
protection
that
the
candidates
were
voting
for
a
specific
candidate
much
as
they
do
in
electoral
college
not
for
a
legislator
who
performs
many
other
functions
with
no
knowledge
of
him
ever
being
called
on
to
do
this.
in
142
years,
we
have
never
had
this
problem.
so
far
as
we
are
aware
no
other
state
has
ever
had
this
problem.
but
they
do
not
vote
for
legislators
with
the
view
towards
that
one
of
them
will
--
they
will
select
one
of
the
two
candidates
in
a
gubernatorial
race.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
overwhelming
majority
of
states
do
your
honor.
we
do
not
find
it
necessary
in
this
case
to
reach
the
constitutionality
of
that
problem
which
may
have
considerations
other
than
those
expressed
in
our
own
constitution
under
the
circumstances
present
in
this
case.
that
tie
vote
may
well
be
justified
by
considerations
that
are
just
not
pertinent
here,
the
only
reason.
this
goes
to
the
general
assembly
is
not
because
the
electorate
is
deadlock
on
a
tie
vote
with
no
clear
expression
of
a
--
even
a
plurality
will
of
the
type
which
would
be
sufficient
in
47
of
our
50
states.
the
reason
is
in
the
name
of
majority
vote.
this
doesn't
show
majority
vote.
it
does
not
assure
a
majority
support.
the
legislator
has
prescribed
a
far
less
restrictive
alternative
in
the
election
code
which
is
permissible
in
this
court
in
a
number
of
opinions
has
recognized
that
even
if
the
legislative
purpose
is
legitimate
and
substantial
as
admittedly
here,
the
desire
to
have
the
governor
elected
by
majority
vote
is.
it
may
not
pursue
this
in
a
manner
that
is
unduly
restrictive
of
the
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
or
the
other
citizens
of
georgia
to
elect
their
governor
in
a
popular
election.(voice

--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
your
honor,
we
feel
again
that
this
is
a
question
which
may
not
be
reached
in
this
litigation
because
whether
or
not
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
confers
a
right
on
every
citizen
of
georgia
in
the
first
instance
to
elect
its
governor
had
georgia
chosen
a
prime
minister
system
or
some
other
system.
the
situation
in
georgia
is
that
georgia
says
that
the
people
shall
elect
their
governor.
they
participate
in
the
primary
election.
they
participate
in
the
general
election.
the
georgia
constitution,
the
very
first
section
of
bill
of
rights
which
was
put
in
only
in
1877
more
than
40
years
after
this
provision
became
a
part
of
the
constitution
says
that
all
state
offices
are
the
trustees
of
the
people.
our
constitution
has
undergone
a
change
of
democratizing
in
itself.
first
and
foremost
and
always
in
georgia,
the
governor
is
elected
and
is
understood
to
be
elected
by
the
people.
this
is
merely
a
very
minor
situation
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
it
was
a
basic
change
that
was
--
that
increased
democratization
in
1824.
there
was
further
increase
in
1877
when
our
bill
of
rights
put
in
stronger
language
then
was
ever
in
there
before
recognizing
that
the
people
first
and
foremost
are
the
basis
for
government
in
georgia
and
that
all
public
offices
including
the
governor
are
trustees
directly
responsible
for
the
people.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
our
position
is
your
honor
that
these
provisions
which
i
have
been
discussing
demonstrate
in
the
same
sense
that
the
county
unit
legislation
and
the
county
unit
case
demonstrated
that
the
election
in
georgia
is
on
the
basis
of
the
people
that
the
state
has
made
a
conscious
choice.
and
that
this
choice
is
only
departed
from
in
the
isolated
situation
arising
from
the
failure
to
achieve
a
majority.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
of
course,
reynolds
involved
district
elections
in
one
sense.
the
governor
--
gray
is
the
only
real
statewide
election
case
that
in
my
view
that
this
court
has
had.
the
state
--
every
citizen
in
the
state
is
eligible
to
vote
for
one
of
these
two
candidates
in
a
runoff
election
or
in
the
general
election
on
november
8,
1966.
they
are
not
in
districts
for
any
other
purpose.
if
they
are
--
and
this
governor
is
designed
to
be
responsive
to
all
of
those
people.
mr.
emmet

neither

nor
the

nor
many
of

myriad
of
imperious

expressed
the
position,
power,
prestige
and
importance
of
the

of
the

who
heads
one
of
the
major
three
branches
of
state

the

answers

mr.
emmet

if
that
were
the
question
your
honor,
we
would
unhesitatingly
take
the
position
that
the
federal
constitution
would
not
permit
us
now
to
go
back
to
monarchy
or
any
other
form
of
government.
given
the
fact
that
the
chief
executive
of
a
state
is
now
occupies
a
position
which
he
now
occupies.
it's
interesting,
it
seems
to
me
very
remote
to
be
(voice

--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
say
that
it
is
changed
in
the
same
sense
that
apportionment
of
legislatures
has
changed
since
1790.in
1790,
at
the
time
of
the
final
ratification
of
the
constitution
over
half
of
the
13
original
colonies
elected
their
governor
in
a
popular
and
or
immediately
thereafter
even
when
the
first
constitution
inducted
after
that
time.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
agree
completely
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
and
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
suggest
that
we
have
precisely
that
an
election
by
the
people
if
the
general
assembly
is
not
involved
at
any
other
stage.
it
would
be
incredible
and
indeed
i'm
conscionable
to
suggest
that
after
this
court's
decision
in
gray
versus
sanders,
the
georgia
general
assembly
without
changing
the
general
election
process
could
have
gone
back
and
said,
“we
will
nominate
all
candidates.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
but
gray
could
not
be
evaded
by
that
sort
of
device.this
device
works
at
the
other
end
of
the
legislative
process.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
it
was
considerably
after
1824.
it
was
in
1868
at
which
time
all
states
elected
their
governor
in
a
popular
election.
there
was
no
state
which
still
provided
the
legislative
election
as
georgia
had
in
1798
until
1824.
and
that
fact,
the
historical
argument
that
was
made
that
in
1868
the
legislatures
of
the
state
were
not
only
one
man,
one
vote
basis
was
easily
rejected
by
this
court.
it
would
seem
to
me
its
no
greater
step
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
reads
in
to
state
government
given
the
power
to
the
chief
executive
the
uniformed
practice
of
all
of
the
states
in
1868.
it's
no
surprise
to
me
that
georgia
has
not
considered
repealing
this
provision
before
since
it's
never
occurred?
and
as
long
as
we
were
a
one
party
state,
it
was
never
likely
to
occur
because
we
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
well,
your
honor
i
would
suggest
that
the
general
assembly
has
attempted
to
do
precisely
that
and
which
would
have
occurred
but
for
two
–
for
two
of
the
circumstances
not
now
before
the
court.
but
the
constitutional
problem
remains.
georgia
does
have
a
popular
election.
it
is
whatever
held
it
maybe
called
in
any
other
place,
on
any
other
system.
it
is
an
election
by
the
people.
the
people
if
the
write-in
votes
had
not
been
count
–
cast
would
have
finally
decided
this
question
on
november
8
and
the
general
assembly
would
never
had
been
involved.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
suggest
that's
just
simply
not
this
case.
we
have
done
something
entirely
different.
it
makes
it
very
abstract
and
hypothetical
and
frankly,
we
don't
feel
capable
of
anticipating
all
the
ramifications
of
that
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
would
feel
of
course
that
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
tie
situation.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
tie
situation
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
would
say
if
compelled
to
reach
it
to
justify
our
position
if
a
tie
situation
would
also
be
unconstitutional.
we
feel
that
our
situation
is
far
stronger
because
there
is
a
readily
available
alternative
in
a
runoff
election
to
achieve
majority.
we're
not
in
this
situation
of
a
tie.
the
considerations
justifying
going
to
a
legislature
--
to
the
legislature
in
a
tie
situation
are
because
there
is
a
genuine
deadlock,
you
can't
get
the
machine
off
the
assembly
--
(voice

--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
are
suggesting
that
they
have
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
oh,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
in
the
nature
of
republican
government.
the
write-in
people
nor
i
nor
anyone
else
has
a
right
to
vote
for
a
candidate
who's
not
qualified
and
we
have
that
question
in
georgia
already
decided.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
black.
i
didn't
understand
you?
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
didn't
realize
that
i
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
alright.
i
didn't
realize
that
i
have
taken
the
position
that
we
were
arguing
under
article
iv
section
4.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
don't
real
--
i
don't
even
recall
that.
but
it
would
--
i
would
hesitate
to
try
to
define
it
in
the
time
that
we
have
but
i
would
say
at
least
where
a
governor
has
the
major
branch
of
government
as
he
does
in
georgia
and
has
the
powers
that
he
has
and
we
start
an
election
process
in
which
all
of
the
people
could
qualify,
can
participate
and
simply
because
the
majority
rule
we
want
to
take
it
away
and
go
to
some
other
system
where
that
expressed
will
of
nearly
a
million
georgians
can
be
totally
disregarded.
second
candidate
you
can
hypothesize
a
much
worst
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
think
that
would
certainly
be
indicative
of
that
in
our
situation.
it
would
certainly
not
fail
to
comply
if
the
people
had
at
least
had
that
right?
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
certainly
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
certainly,
that's
a
reasonable
accommodation
of
the
right
of
the
people
to
select
their
representatives
in
a
reasonable
sort
of
manner
and
the
right
of
the
state
to
get
on
with
state
government
and
get
an
executive
qualified
within
the
time
limits
available.
this
situation
has
not
arisen
before.
we
are
not
threatened
with
multiple
endless
elections.
our
general
assembly
is
adequately
anticipated
that
problem
even
though
they
haven't
able
to
get
through
in
the
constitutional
problem.
and
we
won't
have
endless
series
of
elections.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
not
at
all.
we
are
simply
trying
to
accommodate
in
the
name
of
our
only
constitutional
requirement
of
majority
rule.
those
candidates
who
can't
command
a
sufficient
strength
practically
be
considered
to
be
entitled
to
the
runoff
if
the
legislators
wanted
to
say
the
top
four
that
would
have
been
the
legislature's
judgment.
but
as
long
as
it's
going
to
require
majority
rule.
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
take
away
from
the
people
of
a
state
the
right
to
make
this
final
determination
in
place
of
the
county
unit
system.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
even
though
they
try
and
cannot
get
the
majority
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
say
that
it
takes
at
most
two
shots.
it's
not
essential
if
it
takes
two
shots.
it
never
has
for
more
than
142
years
and
until
1942,
we
have
gubernatorial
elections
every
two
years.
it
has
not
been
of
significance
before
georgia
because
we
never
had
a
two-party
system.
we've
never
had
a
contest
in
the
general
election
that
made
any
real
difference.
and
in
primaries,
in
this
primary
in
this
year,
we
had
a
failure
to
achieve
a
majority
for
a
democratic
nominee
and
what
did
we
do?
we
held
a
runoff.
now,
we
didn't
go
to
the
general
assembly
and
we
didn't
go
to
some
other
electoral
college
body
or
party
executive
committee
or
any
other
group.
we
said
that
we'll
have
a
runoff
between
the
two
candidates
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
and
we
had
that
runoff.
there
were
five
candidates.
there
were
no
particular
write-in
efforts,
if
there
were,
the
votes
were
not
counted.
and
we
selected
from
those
two
the
candidate
whom
would
carry
the
democratic
standard
and
for
the
general
election.
it
seems
clear
that
this
is
--
it
makes
no
point
to
argue
what
other
systems
georgia
might
have.
this
is
a
people's
election.
justice
matthews
in
the
county
unit
case,
one
of
the
defenses
indeed
argued
in
the
unit
case
was,
“no
one
has
a
right
to
equal
protection
in
the
primary
elections
because
georgia
permits
you
to
nominate
by
conviction.
and
nobody
in
a
party
convention
has
a
right
to
an
equal
vote
or
equal
representation
depending
on
where
they
live.”
so,
since
georgia
could
have
chosen
that
method
initially
it
did
not
have
to
permit
nomination
by
a
primary.
it
was
perfectly
alright
to
do
this
in
the
democratic
primary
election.
after
all,
if
you
didn't
like
it,
you
could
still
have
a
conviction.
but
this
court
rejected
that
and
said,
“what
other
methods
georgia
might
have
chosen
it
also
had
the
primary.”
and
once
its
chose
to
put
this
on
the
basis,
the
people
in
the
primary,
it
is
a
people
selection.
one
man,
one
vote
in
any
system
of
waiting
those
votes
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
one
man
one
vote
where
the
state
has
selected
the
unit
and
we
suggest
that
unit
is
the
people.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
we
suggest
that
just
as
it's
selected
the
people
in
the
primary
elections,
georgia
has
also
selected
the
people
in
the
general
election.
and
the
only
reason
it
purports
to
depart
from
the
people
as
the
basic
unit
of
selection
is
in
the
name
of
majority
rules.
the
faith
of
the
people
to
cast
a
majority
of
their
ballots,
it
would
be
ironic
if
the
people
are
to
be
deprived
to
their
right
to
choose
entirely,
if
by
mere
faith
of
a
majority
of
it
to
cast
their
ballots
for
a
single
candidate.
the
essence
of
majority
rule
is
that
the
people,
a
sufficient
number
of
the
people
cast
those
votes
together.
and
its
ironic
if
the
split
among
the
people
is
to
deprive
the
people
of
any
hand
in
the
process
whatsoever.
convert
them
over
into
the
mere
nominating
procedure
and
have
a
legislative
body
in
which
they
are
not
equally
represented
far
further
to
make
the
final
selection
where
in
the
cobb
county
for
instance,
a
suburb
of
atlanta
that
grossly
underrepresented
by
more
than
40%
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate.
there
are
seven
senators,
it
was
a
heavy
vote
for
one
candidate
in
that
county.
these
seven
senators
and
representatives
cannot
vote
equally
with
those
of
other
counties
which
are
overrepresented
by
more
than
40%.they
are
losing
the
effectiveness
of
those
votes.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
are
the
people
to
be
penalized
because
of
this?
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
it's
unconscionable
to
have
the
division
in
the
electorate
--
deprive
the
electorate
of
any
right
to
choose
all
together.
so
far
as
i
know,
no
one
else
should
attemptted
it
and
it's
never
happened.
and
it
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
if
forced
to
that
i
would
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
this
court
need
only
say
that
it
seems
to
us
as
it
did
in
the
county
unit
case
that
georgia
has
placed
this
election
on
the
basis
of
the
people.
that
the
people
are
sovereign
in
georgia
that
it
is
their
choice
and
having
made
it
a
choice
of
the
people
election
that
state
cannot
thereafter
use
any
device
whether
the
name
of
majority
rule
or
any
other
device
which
would
wait
those
votes
unequally
between
voters
living
in
different
areas
of
the
states.
this
court
need
not
reach
the
question
whether
had
georgia
initially
done
what
no
other
state
for
more
than
a
100
years
has
tried
to
do,
wanted
to
put
this
in
an
election
--
in
the
legislature
itself.
this
court
need
not
reach
it
and
i'm
sure
that
georgia
citizens
would
not
be
deterrent
if
they
chose
to
try
to
adopt
that
system.
it's
incredible
in
view
of
our
historical
practice
in
any
state
would
try
to
do
this
here
in
the
20th
century.
the
trend
has
been
since
1790
away
from
legislative
election
and
towards
popular
election.
and
if
one
man,
one
vote
means
anything
in
statewide
elections
it
should
mean
that
in
the
final
selection
of
the
chief
executive
of
georgia.
the
questions
of
remedy
which
have
been
raised
here,
we
find
to
be
quite
easy.
they
are
those
which
were
prescribed
by
the
general
assembly
in
1964
in
their
expressed
language,
they
are
applicable.
they
reflect
consistently
with
the
position
which
we
have
taken,
the
state
policy
of
georgia
favoring
election,
final
election
by
the
people
of
georgia.
this
was
almost
a
part
of
the
organic
law
of
the
state
of
georgia
by
virtue
of
the
1964
proposed
constitution.
it
is
not
upon
of
it
in
1966
because
of
circumstances
beyond
the
control
of
the
general
assembly
and
the
electorate.but
the
remedy
is
clear.
it's
consistent
with
this
policy
and
it
would
afford
that
all
the
georgia
citizens
as
the
general
assembly
to
whom
the
state
is
now
trying
to
force
this
decision.
that
of
which
the
general
assembly
has
already
said
is
the
direction
it
should
take,
a
one
man,
one
vote
runoff
election
between
the
candidatesreceiving
the
highest
vote
in
the
general
election.
it
would
be
just
unconscionable
in
view
of
this
court's
decisions
providing
equal
votes
and
legislatures
providing
an
equal
right
to
select
the
congressman
to
provide
an
equal
vote
in
primary
elections.
you
could
now
say
that
the
final
selection
in
the
--
on
any
basis
other
than
an
equal
vote.
the
citizens
of
georgia
deserve
the
right
to
make
these
decisions
for
themselves
where
they
all
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
have
a
voice
in
the
final
selection
to
deny
them
this
write-in
in
the
name
of
an
1824
constitutional
provision
providing
for
the
sole
purpose
of
majority.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
agree
completely
that
not
just
age
but
the
change
policy.
the
change
policy
is
reflected
under
state
constitutions
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
don't
have
the
same
state
constitution
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
do
not
have
the
fourteenth
amendment
since
1824.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
did
not
had
it
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that's
correct.
we
didn't
have
the
seventeenth
amendment
putting
the
right
to
select
senators
and
the
people
there
is
an
increasing
democratization
of
all
of
these
choices.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that's
right.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that's
right.
baker

mr.

in

precise
situation
between

living

cobb
county
of
georgia
and
citizens
living
in
bulloch
county
and
all
the
other
counties
of
the
state
who
are
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
recognize
that
it
was
in
the
constitution
of
1868
which
at
the
time
of
our
readmission
would
have
at
least
presumptively
been
reviewed
by
the
congress.
but
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
in
wesberry
against
sanders
answered
the
question
as
to
whether
any
sort
of
congressional
sanction
of
continued
malapportionment
of
congressional
districts
or
any
other
system
could
justify
this
court's
refusal
to
act
where
it
found
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
i
would
suggest
also
that
the
very
practicality
of
the
situation
of
this
provision
never
having
been
called
into
play.
we'd
never
focus
anybody's
attention
in
the
state
of
georgia
on
this
provision
or
--
and
otherwise,
it
probably
would
have
been
changed
long
before
now
or
challenged
long
before
now.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
is
certainly
no
ratification.
but
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
in
1868,
every
state
elected
its
governor
and
recognized
the
right
of
the
people
to
participate
in
a
far
greater
degree
should
be
read
as
having
some
implications
on
this
decision
made
by
this
court
in
(inaudible).
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
precisely,
at
the
same
session
–
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
--
it
was
an
extraordinary
may-june
session
in
the
days
of
the
malapportionment
in
the
house
before
this
court's
decision
in
reynolds
against
sims.
the
general
assembly
drafted
a
new
constitution
which
provided
expressly
for
runoff
elections
in
the
fair
beginning
in
1966.
so
it
could
be
ratified
in
1964
in
the
election
code
tracking
the
same
language,
having
the
same
provisions
in
the
same
purposes
said
in
broad
language,
“all
public
offices
of
the
state
should
be
elected
by
a
majority
vote
and
there
shall
be
a
runoff
between
the
two
candidates
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
in
the
event
no
candidate
receives
a
majority.”
the
legislature
was
not
trying
to
ignore
the
1824
provision.
it
was
trying
to
correct
it
in
a
manner
which
we
feel
as
far
more
consistent
with
the
compliance
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
having
plenary
power
to
propose
amendments
to
the
constitution,
i
would
suggest
that
the
general
assembly
chose
to
use
that
means
rather
the
means
which
we
have
been
forced
to
resort
to
in
this
litigation
to
delete
the
1824
provision.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that
is
correct.
but
until
then
there
was
not
even
threat
of
a
two-party
system
which
might
gave
rise
to
a
contest
in
the
general
election.
we
already
have
runoffs
and
primaries,
democratic
primaries
being
the
only
genuine
elections
in
georgia
and
statewide
races.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
as
an
entire
document.
it
did
not
enjoined
the
proposal
of
single
amendments
in
the
manner
permitted
by
state
law
for
single
and
rejection
or
acceptance
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
issue
came
here
and
this
court
declined
to
advance
hearing
before
the
november
8,
1964
general
election.
and
following
the
november
8
general
election,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
moved
to
dismiss
the
appeal
as
moot
because
there
was
no
longer
a
need
for
an
ongoing
injunction
and
this
court
remanded
to
the
district
court
not
with
disapproval
i
would
suggest
but
for
reconsideration
as
to
the
need
of
that
continuing
injunction.
the
plaintiffs
no
longer
ask
for
the
injunction.
the
district
court
didn't
find
it
necessary.
and
it
was
accordingly
vacated
and
unless
and
until
we
--
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
resubmit
the
same
constitution
so
the
problem
has
not
arisen.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
ironically,
that
it
happens
to
be
the
result
that
the
general
assembly
far
more
malapportioned
than
today
has
recognized
more
fully
than
perhaps
others
that
the
people
should
make
this
choice.
and
they
had
--
did
everything
possible
to
enable
the
people
to
do
so.
it's
interesting
to
know
that
the
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
if
this
provision
is
not
eliminated
mr.
justice
white,
the
legislature
would
not
have
the
power
to
do
so
since
an
amendment
could
only
be
submitted
at
a
two-year
general
election
under
state
law.
so,
unless
this
court
acts
as
did
the
district
court
the
legislative
processes
as
in
georgia
are
helpless
to
remedy
this
situation.
if
it
should
go
to
the
general
assembly,
the
general
assembly
will
meet
in
effect
as
a
committee
of
the
whole
or
its
own
electoral
college
solely
for
the
purpose
of
electing
the
governor.
there
would
be
no
debate
under
the
rules
of
the
house,
majority
of
each
house
is
necessarily
constitute
a
forum
but
as
soon
as
that
forum
exists
in
the
house
as
thus
constituted
they
forthwith
proceed
to
elect.
there
would
be
no
review
after
reapportionment.
this
would
carry
until
1968.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
no,
i
haven't
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
frankly,
i
know
of
no
explanation
other
than
that
seems
to
have
been
common
in
similar
provisions
of
other
state
constitutions
which
most
of
which
provided
for
tie
vote
situations
which
never
arose.
i
think
this
was
probably
just
arose
--
copying
from
another
provision.
the
rules
of
the
house
provide
for
division
of
the
house
if
the
voice
vote
should
be
indeterminate.
but
this
isn't
just
simply
not
like
the
normal
legislative
process.
this
is
stopping
the
consequences
of
which
cannot
be
remedied
after
we
achieve
fair
apportionment.
i
would
suggest
then
in
response
to
questions
previously
raised
that
although
the
general
assembly
maybe
--
have
been
approved
both
by
the
district
court
and
by
this
court
on
a
temporary
basis
for
ordinary
legislation.
the
district
court
was
very
emphatic
in
its
language
that
the
present
plan
of
senate
apportionment
in
georgia
and
this
is
the
court
speaking
in
1966
and
the
proposed
plan
of
house
reapportionments
separately
and
collectively
fall
short
of
the
mandate
of
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
below
said
that
a
15%
standard
which
they
said
within
the
circumstances
of
georgia
no
departure
beyond
that
could
be
justified.
more
than
half
of
our
districts
in
the
house
exceed
15%.
more
than
a
third
exceed
20%.
we
have
extremes
of
more
than
40%,
an
extreme
of
more
than
2
to
2.6
to
1
in
the
house.
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
minor
situation
in
an
election.
this
is
far
more
critical
than
in
an
ordinary
legislative
processes.
that's
a
one
man,
one
vote
here.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
say
that
the
significance
to
that
fact
is
that
this
court
under
the
circumstances
which
it
then
foresaw
in
recognizing
its
retained
powers
as
the
court
of
equity
and
that
of
the
district
court.
in
the
event
of
changed
circumstances
to
amend
its
order
in
any
way
if
found
necessary
or
appropriate
but
it
was
alright
to
approve
on
an
interim
basis
for
which
we
could
then
proceed
which
was
ordinary
legislation
for
two
years,
constitutional
apportionment
being
achieved
in
1968.
this
will
not
be
achieved
if
the
general
assembly
is
now
allowed
to
elect
the
governor
who
will
hold
office
until
1971.
court
of
equity
would
have
no
power
in
modifying
this
decree
if
the
circumstance
is
changed.
if
a
new
constitution
were
to
be
proposed,
this
court
has
not
disapproved
that.
and
if
that
occurred,
we
would
expect
someone
to
move
in
the
district
court
to
ensure
the
right
of
people
of
the
future
to
have
an
equal
voice
in
these
major
decisions
and
that
is
one
of
these
decisions
before
the
court
today.
in
conclusion,
we
express
our
appreciation
for
the
opportunity
of
having
this
matter
aired
fully
before
this
court
expeditiously.
the
rights
which
we
assert
are
first
and
foremost
federally
constituted
rights.
the
right
of
the
people
of
a
state
to
elect
their
governor
which
we
feel
will
be
deprived
unless
the
district
court's
decision
is
affirmed.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
before
proceeding
to
the
merits
and
i
feel
we
must
meet
the
problem
raised
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
whether
we
have
in
this
court
a
case
of
controversy
on
reasonably
concrete
facts
on
which
this
court
can
act.
mr.
morgan
has
touched
on
this
question.
the
district
court
took
judicial
notice
of
a
common
public
fact
in
georgia
that
no
candidate
received
the
majority
of
the
votes
properly
casts
in
the
november
8th
general
election.
at
the
time
it
was
meeting,
this
was
a
commonly
known
fact.
further,
although
the
state
makes
this
argument
that
the
returns
are
sealed
and
cannot
be
unsealed
until
the
general
assembly
meets
by
law
34-1506
(a)
of
the
election
code
certified
copies,
identical
to
those
which
are
sealed
are
retained
in
the
office
of
the
ordinary
as
public
records
open
to
public
inspection
by
anyone
in
the
state
of
georgia.
since
that
time
because
of
the
expedition
in
which
this
case
is
handled
ourselves
representing
justice
et
al
and
the
state
have
joined
in
a
stipulation
which
has
been
presented
to
clerk's
office
in
which
we
have
obtained
on
the
basis
of
telegram
request
from
this
ordinaries
what
these
returns
showed
based
on
the
statutory
records
and
they
have
notified
us
and
from
all
the
counties,
a
148
counties
of
the
159.
we
do
not
have
with
--
just
because
of
the
practically
of
the
situation,
the
repetitive
approach
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
148
of
the
159
counties
have
notified
us.
the
remaining
11
counties,
the
--
all
public
information
indicates
casts
combined
fewer
votes
then
would
take
it
to
make
a
majority.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
notification
is
that
no
candidate
has
received
the
majority.
and
the
total
vote
cast
under
the
remaining
11
counties
from
which
we
have
not
heard
by
telegram
would
not
be
sufficient
to
give
any
candidate
the
majority
even
if
totally
added
to
his
total.
so
there
can
be
no
question.
this
situation
will
be
called
into
play
that
this
is
a
real
genuine
case
of
controversy
between
adverse
interests.
this
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
news
election
service
as
i
understand
it
justice
brennan
computed
returns
through
noon
on
friday
following
the
election
on
tuesday
and
at
the
time
when
we
were
in
the
district
court
this
was
the
most
current
information
which
we
then
have.
many
counties
have
paper
ballots
and
tallied
very
slowly.
the
discrepancies
undoubtedly
are
result
of
final
tabulations
being
completed
after
that
time,
particularly
write-in
ballots
which
in
fulton
county,
atlanta
there
were
more
than
15,000,
16,000,
20,000
which
took
a
great
period
of
time
to
tabulate.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
other
metropolitan
counties.
these
have
been
added
to
the
total
since
then
and
they
do
change
the
totals.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
as
we
understand
it
with
the
exception
of
11
counties,
these
are
according
to
the
ordinaries,
communicated
by
wired
to
us
or
by
letter
that
which
is
shown
by
the
certified
copies
which
they
maintained
by
law
in
their
respective
offices
open
to
public
inspection.
the
originals
of
which
or
duplicate
copies
of
which
have
been
sealed
and
forwarded
to
the
secretary
of
state
under
the
provisions
to
which
the
state
refers.
so
there
is
no
question
of
acting
in
a
hypothetical
confusing
or
possibly
changeable
situation
when
those
sealed
returns
opening
--
opened.
we
know
what
our
situation
is.
everyone
knows
what
it
is.
this
case
is
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
–
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
absentee
ballots
were
necessarily
excluded
from
the
news
selection
service
tabulation
and
were
counted
more
slowly
and
therefore
later,
when
their
service
terminated
on
noon
on
friday
after
the
election
on
tuesday.
as
we
understand
it,
these
absentee
ballots
are
included
in
the
certified
returns,
the
information
of
which
has
been
communicated.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
the
certified
returns
would
include
everything
necessarily
because
they
could
not
be
sealed
and
forwarded
until
all
votes
were
included.
this
case
is
as
we
suggest
not
a
representation
case.
this
is
not
reynolds
and
sims.
this
is
not
wesberry
against
sanders.
this
is
not
even
toombs
against
fortson.
this
is
the
right
of
the
people
of
georgia,
the
citizens
and
all
of
our
159
counties
to
elect
her
governor
in
a
popular
statewide
election
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis.
we
do
not
have
here
the
question
as
to
whether
had
georgia
chose
and
initially
in
1966
to
put
this
election
in
some
other
agency,
whatever
that
agency
might
be
whether
that
the
constitutionally
be
done.
we
have
the
question
of
whether
georgia
having
–
by
its
constitution
said
that
there
shall
be
a
primary
election
of
which
every
citizens
of
the
state
may
participate.
a
general
election
in
which
every
citizen
of
the
state
qualified
otherwise
may
participate
and
nearly
a
million
did
participate,
may
elect
the
governor.
changed
only
by
the
situation
created
by
georgia's
desire
to
have
a
majority
vote
for
her
governor
which
places
the
final
selection
power
in
the
general
assembly
when
no
majority
is
achieved
in
the
general
election.
this
is
the
sole
purpose
that
the
general
assembly
is
involved
in
any
degree.it
is
a
popular
election
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
it
is
in
every
other
state
except
in
the
unlikely
event
of
a
tie
vote,
a
popular
election.
it
is
the
people's
right
to
elect
their
governor.
it
has
been
in
every
state
since
before
1868
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted.
no
state
by
1868
did
as
georgia
initially
and
elected
the
governor
in
the
legislature
or
any
other
office.
it
was
a
vote
of
the
people
and
it
is
the
vote
of
the
people
in
georgia.
and
everyone
in
georgia
considers
it
such.
the
general
assembly
gets
involved
only
because
no
candidate
received
the
majority.
solely
in
the
name
of
majority
vote
to
achieve
the
strength
of
popular
support
which
majority
expresses
much
better
than
plurality
that
the
general
assembly
become
implicated
in
this
process.
and
yet,
it's
clear
the
general
assembly
will
not
represent
the
strength
of
the
majority
support.
not
merely
so
effectively
as
a
runoff.
the
ironical
and
paradoxical
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
georgia
legislative
process
at
the
time
when
the
legislature
was
far
more
malapportioned
than
we
are
today.
in
1964,
adopted
the
new
election
code
which
in
expressed
language
says,
“there
shall
be
a
runoff
in
every
elected
state
public
office
where
no
candidate
receives
the
majority.”
and
in
that
context
at
the
same
session
adopted
a
new
state
constitution,
they
proposed
a
constitution
which
would
have
repealed,
superseded
and
done
away
with
this
1824
provision
and
would
have
provided
in
expressed
terms
without
a
doubt,
without
debate,
that
this
1966
election
would
have
been
resolved
by
the
vote
of
the
people
of
georgia
in
a
runoff
election
between
the
two
highest
candidates.
there
is
no
possibility
as
mr.
justice
white
has
suggested
that
we
might
have
to
go
on
and
on
because
our
election
code
itself
says,
“that
a
runoff
shall
be
between
the
candidates
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
in
a
general
election.
we
do
not
suggest
that
write-in
votes
can
be
excluded
by
either
this
court
or
the
district
court
by
order
where
the
state
has
not
done
so.
we
suggest
instead
that
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
has
already
done
so
in
the
expressed
language
in
which
it
used
in
the
election
code
that
the
runoff
will
be
between
the
two
candidates
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes.
this
is
after
all
implicit
in
the
nature
of
a
runoff
itself.
but
the
language
was
used
--
general
assembly
has
used
is
consistently
with
the
exclusion
of
write-in
votes.
this
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
attorney
general
has
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
election
code
expresses
what
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
attempted
to
provide
in
1964
and
which
but
for
conflict
with
this
archaic
1824
provision
would
be
the
situation
prescribed
by
the
elected
representatives
in
georgia
for
election
by
the
people
in
1966.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
age
itself
is
nothing
--
is
not
wrong.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yet
in
many
other
things
which
were
not
constructional
have
been
reincorporated.
the
last
adoption
of
the
constitution
was
in
a
manner
which
the
georgia
supreme
court
later
recognized
but
was
powerless
to
remedy
was
a
matter
not
permitted
by
our
state
constitution.
it
was
proposed
as
a
single
amendment
which
that
court
said
was
not
authorized.
the
whole
package
had
to
be
separately
accepted
or
rejected.
and
the
court
said
that
we're
looking
at
it
before
it
had
been
ratified,
it
would
have
been
something
valid
but
could
not
afterwards.
so
the
idea
of
the
ratification
is
that
you
might
have
had
in
the
colorado
case
where
a
single
amendment
was
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
voters
in
every
county
of
the
state
was
not
shown
in
georgia.
the
whole
package,
the
good
and
the
bad
was
approved
in
1945
more
than
20
years
ago.
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
a
voting
rights
case.
that
the
people
of
the
georgia
do
have
a
right
conferred
by
the
georgia
constitution
to
elect
their
governor.
that
the
argument
that
this
is
a
two
step
process
or
that
some
other
process
might
apply
is
mere
sophistry.
the
here
and
now,
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
is
that
950,000
people
have
voted
in
the
general
election.
nearly
900,000
people
have
voted
twice
in
primary
elections
leading
up
to
this.
and
if
those
people
have
the
right
to
elect
their
governor
and
that
the
instrumentality
of
election
by
the
general
assembly
solely
in
the
name
of
majority
rule
is
a
device
which
deprives
these
voters
just
as
truly
as
did
the
old
unit
system
of
nomination
of
the
right
to
a
full
and
equal
voice,
having
been
selected
as
the
common
denominator
for
selection
in
that
final
election
process.
this
is
far
more
pernicious
than
that.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
predict
exactly
what's
its
purpose
was
in
1824
justice
black.
the
problem
now
is
that
the
general
assembly
grossly
unrepresentative
may
elect
in
a
manner
not
consistent
with
the
prior
choices
in
the
same
election
expressed
by
the
people
between
the
candidates
put
before
the
general
assembly.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
we
take
it
on
two
basis.first
is
on
the
initial
basis
of
the
county
unit
system
itself
as
you
will
recall
the
county
unit
system.
and
the
county
unit
votes
were
distributed
in
gubernatorial
primary
elections
based
on
representation
in
the
georgia
general
assembly
which
was
apportioned
on
the
old
321
system.
you
had
two
unit
votes
for
each
sits
you
had
in
the
house.
if
georgia
hears
merely
by
a
legislative
of
election
substituted,
animate
legislators
from
inanimate
objects.
in
the
unit
system
you
at
least
had
the
protection
that
the
candidates
were
voting
for
a
specific
candidate
much
as
they
do
in
electoral
college
not
for
a
legislator
who
performs
many
other
functions
with
no
knowledge
of
him
ever
being
called
on
to
do
this.
in
142
years,
we
have
never
had
this
problem.
so
far
as
we
are
aware
no
other
state
has
ever
had
this
problem.
but
they
do
not
vote
for
legislators
with
the
view
towards
that
one
of
them
will
--
they
will
select
one
of
the
two
candidates
in
a
gubernatorial
race.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
overwhelming
majority
of
states
do
your
honor.
we
do
not
find
it
necessary
in
this
case
to
reach
the
constitutionality
of
that
problem
which
may
have
considerations
other
than
those
expressed
in
our
own
constitution
under
the
circumstances
present
in
this
case.
that
tie
vote
may
well
be
justified
by
considerations
that
are
just
not
pertinent
here,
the
only
reason.
this
goes
to
the
general
assembly
is
not
because
the
electorate
is
deadlock
on
a
tie
vote
with
no
clear
expression
of
a
--
even
a
plurality
will
of
the
type
which
would
be
sufficient
in
47
of
our
50
states.
the
reason
is
in
the
name
of
majority
vote.
this
doesn't
show
majority
vote.
it
does
not
assure
a
majority
support.
the
legislator
has
prescribed
a
far
less
restrictive
alternative
in
the
election
code
which
is
permissible
in
this
court
in
a
number
of
opinions
has
recognized
that
even
if
the
legislative
purpose
is
legitimate
and
substantial
as
admittedly
here,
the
desire
to
have
the
governor
elected
by
majority
vote
is.
it
may
not
pursue
this
in
a
manner
that
is
unduly
restrictive
of
the
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
or
the
other
citizens
of
georgia
to
elect
their
governor
in
a
popular
election.(voice

--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
your
honor,
we
feel
again
that
this
is
a
question
which
may
not
be
reached
in
this
litigation
because
whether
or
not
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
confers
a
right
on
every
citizen
of
georgia
in
the
first
instance
to
elect
its
governor
had
georgia
chosen
a
prime
minister
system
or
some
other
system.
the
situation
in
georgia
is
that
georgia
says
that
the
people
shall
elect
their
governor.
they
participate
in
the
primary
election.
they
participate
in
the
general
election.
the
georgia
constitution,
the
very
first
section
of
bill
of
rights
which
was
put
in
only
in
1877
more
than
40
years
after
this
provision
became
a
part
of
the
constitution
says
that
all
state
offices
are
the
trustees
of
the
people.
our
constitution
has
undergone
a
change
of
democratizing
in
itself.
first
and
foremost
and
always
in
georgia,
the
governor
is
elected
and
is
understood
to
be
elected
by
the
people.
this
is
merely
a
very
minor
situation
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
it
was
a
basic
change
that
was
--
that
increased
democratization
in
1824.
there
was
further
increase
in
1877
when
our
bill
of
rights
put
in
stronger
language
then
was
ever
in
there
before
recognizing
that
the
people
first
and
foremost
are
the
basis
for
government
in
georgia
and
that
all
public
offices
including
the
governor
are
trustees
directly
responsible
for
the
people.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
our
position
is
your
honor
that
these
provisions
which
i
have
been
discussing
demonstrate
in
the
same
sense
that
the
county
unit
legislation
and
the
county
unit
case
demonstrated
that
the
election
in
georgia
is
on
the
basis
of
the
people
that
the
state
has
made
a
conscious
choice.
and
that
this
choice
is
only
departed
from
in
the
isolated
situation
arising
from
the
failure
to
achieve
a
majority.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
of
course,
reynolds
involved
district
elections
in
one
sense.
the
governor
--
gray
is
the
only
real
statewide
election
case
that
in
my
view
that
this
court
has
had.
the
state
--
every
citizen
in
the
state
is
eligible
to
vote
for
one
of
these
two
candidates
in
a
runoff
election
or
in
the
general
election
on
november
8,
1966.
they
are
not
in
districts
for
any
other
purpose.
if
they
are
--
and
this
governor
is
designed
to
be
responsive
to
all
of
those
people.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
your
honor,
i
--
again,
i
suggest
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
secretary
of
--
neither
the
secretary
of
state
nor
the
state
auditor
nor
the
attorney
general
nor
many
of
the
other
period
myriad
of
imperious
state
offices
expressed
the
position,
power,
prestige
and
importance
of
the
chief
executive
of
the
state
who
heads
one
of
the
major
three
branches
of
state
government.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
suggest
that
precisely
the
question
and
that
answers
the
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
if
that
were
the
question
your
honor,
we
would
unhesitatingly
take
the
position
that
the
federal
constitution
would
not
permit
us
now
to
go
back
to
monarchy
or
any
other
form
of
government.
given
the
fact
that
the
chief
executive
of
a
state
is
now
occupies
a
position
which
he
now
occupies.
it's
interesting,
it
seems
to
me
very
remote
to
be
(voice

--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
say
that
it
is
changed
in
the
same
sense
that
apportionment
of
legislatures
has
changed
since
1790.in
1790,
at
the
time
of
the
final
ratification
of
the
constitution
over
half
of
the
13
original
colonies
elected
their
governor
in
a
popular
and
or
immediately
thereafter
even
when
the
first
constitution
inducted
after
that
time.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
agree
completely
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
and
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
suggest
that
we
have
precisely
that
an
election
by
the
people
if
the
general
assembly
is
not
involved
at
any
other
stage.
it
would
be
incredible
and
indeed
i'm
conscionable
to
suggest
that
after
this
court's
decision
in
gray
versus
sanders,
the
georgia
general
assembly
without
changing
the
general
election
process
could
have
gone
back
and
said,
“we
will
nominate
all
candidates.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
but
gray
could
not
be
evaded
by
that
sort
of
device.this
device
works
at
the
other
end
of
the
legislative
process.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
it
was
considerably
after
1824.
it
was
in
1868
at
which
time
all
states
elected
their
governor
in
a
popular
election.
there
was
no
state
which
still
provided
the
legislative
election
as
georgia
had
in
1798
until
1824.
and
that
fact,
the
historical
argument
that
was
made
that
in
1868
the
legislatures
of
the
state
were
not
only
one
man,
one
vote
basis
was
easily
rejected
by
this
court.
it
would
seem
to
me
its
no
greater
step
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
reads
in
to
state
government
given
the
power
to
the
chief
executive
the
uniformed
practice
of
all
of
the
states
in
1868.
it's
no
surprise
to
me
that
georgia
has
not
considered
repealing
this
provision
before
since
it's
never
occurred?
and
as
long
as
we
were
a
one
party
state,
it
was
never
likely
to
occur
because
we
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
well,
your
honor
i
would
suggest
that
the
general
assembly
has
attempted
to
do
precisely
that
and
which
would
have
occurred
but
for
two
–
for
two
of
the
circumstances
not
now
before
the
court.
but
the
constitutional
problem
remains.
georgia
does
have
a
popular
election.
it
is
whatever
held
it
maybe
called
in
any
other
place,
on
any
other
system.
it
is
an
election
by
the
people.
the
people
if
the
write-in
votes
had
not
been
count
–
cast
would
have
finally
decided
this
question
on
november
8
and
the
general
assembly
would
never
had
been
involved.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
suggest
that's
just
simply
not
this
case.
we
have
done
something
entirely
different.
it
makes
it
very
abstract
and
hypothetical
and
frankly,
we
don't
feel
capable
of
anticipating
all
the
ramifications
of
that
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
would
feel
of
course
that
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
tie
situation.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
tie
situation
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
would
say
if
compelled
to
reach
it
to
justify
our
position
if
a
tie
situation
would
also
be
unconstitutional.
we
feel
that
our
situation
is
far
stronger
because
there
is
a
readily
available
alternative
in
a
runoff
election
to
achieve
majority.
we're
not
in
this
situation
of
a
tie.
the
considerations
justifying
going
to
a
legislature
--
to
the
legislature
in
a
tie
situation
are
because
there
is
a
genuine
deadlock,
you
can't
get
the
machine
off
the
assembly
--
(voice

mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
are
suggesting
that
they
have
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
oh,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
in
the
nature
of
republican
government.
the
write-in
people
nor
i
nor
anyone
else
has
a
right
to
vote
for
a
candidate
who's
not
qualified
and
we
have
that
question
in
georgia
already
decided.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
black.
i
didn't
understand
you?
mr.
emmet

i
didn't
realize
that
i
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
alright.
i
didn't
realize
that
i
have
taken
the
position
that
we
were
arguing
under
article
iv
section
4.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
don't
real
--
i
don't
even
recall
that.
but
it
would
--
i
would
hesitate
to
try
to
define
it
in
the
time
that
we
have
but
i
would
say
at
least
where
a
governor
has
the
major
branch
of
government
as
he
does
in
georgia
and
has
the
powers
that
he
has
and
we
start
an
election
process
in
which
all
of
the
people
could
qualify,
can
participate
and
simply
because
the
majority
rule
we
want
to
take
it
away
and
go
to
some
other
system
where
that
expressed
will
of
nearly
a
million
georgians
can
be
totally
disregarded.
second
candidate
you
can
hypothesize
a
much
worst
case
(voice

--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
think
that
would
certainly
be
indicative
of
that
in
our
situation.
it
would
certainly
not
fail
to
comply
if
the
people
had
at
least
had
that
right?
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
certainly
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
certainly,
that's
a
reasonable
accommodation
of
the
right
of
the
people
to
select
their
representatives
in
a
reasonable
sort
of
manner
and
the
right
of
the
state
to
get
on
with
state
government
and
get
an
executive
qualified
within
the
time
limits
available.
this
situation
has
not
arisen
before.
we
are
not
threatened
with
multiple
endless
elections.
our
general
assembly
is
adequately
anticipated
that
problem
even
though
they
haven't
able
to
get
through
in
the
constitutional
problem.
and
we
won't
have
endless
series
of
elections.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
not
at
all.
we
are
simply
trying
to
accommodate
in
the
name
of
our
only
constitutional
requirement
of
majority
rule.
those
candidates
who
can't
command
a
sufficient
strength
practically
be
considered
to
be
entitled
to
the
runoff
if
the
legislators
wanted
to
say
the
top
four
that
would
have
been
the
legislature's
judgment.
but
as
long
as
it's
going
to
require
majority
rule.
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
take
away
from
the
people
of
a
state
the
right
to
make
this
final
determination
in
place
of
the
county
unit
system.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
even
though
they
try
and
cannot
get
the
majority
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
say
that
it
takes
at
most
two
shots.
it's
not
essential
if
it
takes
two
shots.
it
never
has
for
more
than
142
years
and
until
1942,
we
have
gubernatorial
elections
every
two
years.
it
has
not
been
of
significance
before
georgia
because
we
never
had
a
two-party
system.
we've
never
had
a
contest
in
the
general
election
that
made
any
real
difference.
and
in
primaries,
in
this
primary
in
this
year,
we
had
a
failure
to
achieve
a
majority
for
a
democratic
nominee
and
what
did
we
do?
we
held
a
runoff.
now,
we
didn't
go
to
the
general
assembly
and
we
didn't
go
to
some
other
electoral
college
body
or
party
executive
committee
or
any
other
group.
we
said
that
we'll
have
a
runoff
between
the
two
candidates
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
and
we
had
that
runoff.
there
were
five
candidates.
there
were
no
particular
write-in
efforts,
if
there
were,
the
votes
were
not
counted.
and
we
selected
from
those
two
the
candidate
whom
would
carry
the
democratic
standard
and
for
the
general
election.
it
seems
clear
that
this
is
--
it
makes
no
point
to
argue
what
other
systems
georgia
might
have.
this
is
a
people's
election.
justice
matthews
in
the
county
unit
case,
one
of
the
defenses
indeed
argued
in
the
unit
case
was,
“no
one
has
a
right
to
equal
protection
in
the
primary
elections
because
georgia
permits
you
to
nominate
by
conviction.
and
nobody
in
a
party
convention
has
a
right
to
an
equal
vote
or
equal
representation
depending
on
where
they
live.”
so,
since
georgia
could
have
chosen
that
method
initially
it
did
not
have
to
permit
nomination
by
a
primary.
it
was
perfectly
alright
to
do
this
in
the
democratic
primary
election.
after
all,
if
you
didn't
like
it,
you
could
still
have
a
conviction.
but
this
court
rejected
that
and
said,
“what
other
methods
georgia
might
have
chosen
it
also
had
the
primary.”
and
once
its
chose
to
put
this
on
the
basis,
the
people
in
the
primary,
it
is
a
people
selection.
one
man,
one
vote
in
any
system
of
waiting
those
votes
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
one
man
one
vote
where
the
state
has
selected
the
unit
and
we
suggest
that
unit
is
the
people.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
we
suggest
that
just
as
it's
selected
the
people
in
the
primary
elections,
georgia
has
also
selected
the
people
in
the
general
election.
and
the
only
reason
it
purports
to
depart
from
the
people
as
the
basic
unit
of
selection
is
in
the
name
of
majority
rules.
the
faith
of
the
people
to
cast
a
majority
of
their
ballots,
it
would
be
ironic
if
the
people
are
to
be
deprived
to
their
right
to
choose
entirely,
if
by
mere
faith
of
a
majority
of
it
to
cast
their
ballots
for
a
single
candidate.
the
essence
of
majority
rule
is
that
the
people,
a
sufficient
number
of
the
people
cast
those
votes
together.
and
its
ironic
if
the
split
among
the
people
is
to
deprive
the
people
of
any
hand
in
the
process
whatsoever.
convert
them
over
into
the
mere
nominating
procedure
and
have
a
legislative
body
in
which
they
are
not
equally
represented
far
further
to
make
the
final
selection
where
in
the
cobb
county
for
instance,
a
suburb
of
atlanta
that
grossly
underrepresented
by
more
than
40%
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate.
there
are
seven
senators,
it
was
a
heavy
vote
for
one
candidate
in
that
county.
these
seven
senators
and
representatives
cannot
vote
equally
with
those
of
other
counties
which
are
overrepresented
by
more
than
40%.they
are
losing
the
effectiveness
of
those
votes.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
are
the
people
to
be
penalized
because
of
this?
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
it's
unconscionable
to
have
the
division
in
the
electorate
--
deprive
the
electorate
of
any
right
to
choose
all
together.
so
far
as
i
know,
no
one
else
should
attemptted
it
and
it's
never
happened.
and
it
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
if
forced
to
that
i
would
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
this
court
need
only
say
that
it
seems
to
us
as
it
did
in
the
county
unit
case
that
georgia
has
placed
this
election
on
the
basis
of
the
people.
that
the
people
are
sovereign
in
georgia
that
it
is
their
choice
and
having
made
it
a
choice
of
the
people
election
that
state
cannot
thereafter
use
any
device
whether
the
name
of
majority
rule
or
any
other
device
which
would
wait
those
votes
unequally
between
voters
living
in
different
areas
of
the
states.
this
court
need
not
reach
the
question
whether
had
georgia
initially
done
what
no
other
state
for
more
than
a
100
years
has
tried
to
do,
wanted
to
put
this
in
an
election
--
in
the
legislature
itself.
this
court
need
not
reach
it
and
i'm
sure
that
georgia
citizens
would
not
be
deterrent
if
they
chose
to
try
to
adopt
that
system.
it's
incredible
in
view
of
our
historical
practice
in
any
state
would
try
to
do
this
here
in
the
20th
century.
the
trend
has
been
since
1790
away
from
legislative
election
and
towards
popular
election.
and
if
one
man,
one
vote
means
anything
in
statewide
elections
it
should
mean
that
in
the
final
selection
of
the
chief
executive
of
georgia.
the
questions
of
remedy
which
have
been
raised
here,
we
find
to
be
quite
easy.
they
are
those
which
were
prescribed
by
the
general
assembly
in
1964
in
their
expressed
language,
they
are
applicable.
they
reflect
consistently
with
the
position
which
we
have
taken,
the
state
policy
of
georgia
favoring
election,
final
election
by
the
people
of
georgia.
this
was
almost
a
part
of
the
organic
law
of
the
state
of
georgia
by
virtue
of
the
1964
proposed
constitution.
it
is
not
upon
of
it
in
1966
because
of
circumstances
beyond
the
control
of
the
general
assembly
and
the
electorate.but
the
remedy
is
clear.
it's
consistent
with
this
policy
and
it
would
afford
that
all
the
georgia
citizens
as
the
general
assembly
to
whom
the
state
is
now
trying
to
force
this
decision.
that
of
which
the
general
assembly
has
already
said
is
the
direction
it
should
take,
a
one
man,
one
vote
runoff
election
between
the
candidatesreceiving
the
highest
vote
in
the
general
election.
it
would
be
just
unconscionable
in
view
of
this
court's
decisions
providing
equal
votes
and
legislatures
providing
an
equal
right
to
select
the
congressman
to
provide
an
equal
vote
in
primary
elections.
you
could
now
say
that
the
final
selection
in
the
--
on
any
basis
other
than
an
equal
vote.
the
citizens
of
georgia
deserve
the
right
to
make
these
decisions
for
themselves
where
they
all
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
have
a
voice
in
the
final
selection
to
deny
them
this
write-in
in
the
name
of
an
1824
constitutional
provision
providing
for
the
sole
purpose
of
majority.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
agree
completely
that
not
just
age
but
the
change
policy.
the
change
policy
is
reflected
under
state
constitutions
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
don't
have
the
same
state
constitution
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
do
not
have
the
fourteenth
amendment
since
1824.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
did
not
had
it
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that's
correct.
we
didn't
have
the
seventeenth
amendment
putting
the
right
to
select
senators
and
the
people
there
is
an
increasing
democratization
of
all
of
these
choices.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that's
right.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that's
right.
baker
versus
carr
is
again
a
reflective
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
well,
we
suggest
that
there
is
--
that
discrimination
in
this
precise
situation
between
citizens
living
in
the
cobb
county
of
georgia
and
citizens
living
in
bulloch
county
and
all
the
other
counties
of
the
state
who
are
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
recognize
that
it
was
in
the
constitution
of
1868
which
at
the
time
of
our
readmission
would
have
at
least
presumptively
been
reviewed
by
the
congress.
but
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
in
wesberry
against
sanders
answered
the
question
as
to
whether
any
sort
of
congressional
sanction
of
continued
malapportionment
of
congressional
districts
or
any
other
system
could
justify
this
court's
refusal
to
act
where
it
found
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
i
would
suggest
also
that
the
very
practicality
of
the
situation
of
this
provision
never
having
been
called
into
play.
we'd
never
focus
anybody's
attention
in
the
state
of
georgia
on
this
provision
or
--
and
otherwise,
it
probably
would
have
been
changed
long
before
now
or
challenged
long
before
now.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
is
certainly
no
ratification.
but
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
in
1868,
every
state
elected
its
governor
and
recognized
the
right
of
the
people
to
participate
in
a
far
greater
degree
should
be
read
as
having
some
implications
on
this
decision
made
by
this
court
in
(inaudible).
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
precisely,
at
the
same
session
–
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
--
it
was
an
extraordinary
may-june
session
in
the
days
of
the
malapportionment
in
the
house
before
this
court's
decision
in
reynolds
against
sims.
the
general
assembly
drafted
a
new
constitution
which
provided
expressly
for
runoff
elections
in
the
fair
beginning
in
1966.
so
it
could
be
ratified
in
1964
in
the
election
code
tracking
the
same
language,
having
the
same
provisions
in
the
same
purposes
said
in
broad
language,
“all
public
offices
of
the
state
should
be
elected
by
a
majority
vote
and
there
shall
be
a
runoff
between
the
two
candidates
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
in
the
event
no
candidate
receives
a
majority.”
the
legislature
was
not
trying
to
ignore
the
1824
provision.
it
was
trying
to
correct
it
in
a
manner
which
we
feel
as
far
more
consistent
with
the
compliance
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
having
plenary
power
to
propose
amendments
to
the
constitution,
i
would
suggest
that
the
general
assembly
chose
to
use
that
means
rather
the
means
which
we
have
been
forced
to
resort
to
in
this
litigation
to
delete
the
1824
provision.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
that
is
correct.
but
until
then
there
was
not
even
threat
of
a
two-party
system
which
might
gave
rise
to
a
contest
in
the
general
election.
we
already
have
runoffs
and
primaries,
democratic
primaries
being
the
only
genuine
elections
in
georgia
and
statewide
races.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
as
an
entire
document.
it
did
not
enjoined
the
proposal
of
single
amendments
in
the
manner
permitted
by
state
law
for
single
and
rejection
or
acceptance
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
issue
came
here
and
this
court
declined
to
advance
hearing
before
the
november
8,
1964
general
election.
and
following
the
november
8
general
election,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
moved
to
dismiss
the
appeal
as
moot
because
there
was
no
longer
a
need
for
an
ongoing
injunction
and
this
court
remanded
to
the
district
court
not
with
disapproval
i
would
suggest
but
for
reconsideration
as
to
the
need
of
that
continuing
injunction.
the
plaintiffs
no
longer
ask
for
the
injunction.
the
district
court
didn't
find
it
necessary.
and
it
was
accordingly
vacated
and
unless
and
until
we
--
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
resubmit
the
same
constitution
so
the
problem
has
not
arisen.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
ironically,
that
it
happens
to
be
the
result
that
the
general
assembly
far
more
malapportioned
than
today
has
recognized
more
fully
than
perhaps
others
that
the
people
should
make
this
choice.
and
they
had
--
did
everything
possible
to
enable
the
people
to
do
so.
it's
interesting
to
know
that
the
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
if
this
provision
is
not
eliminated
mr.
justice
white,
the
legislature
would
not
have
the
power
to
do
so
since
an
amendment
could
only
be
submitted
at
a
two-year
general
election
under
state
law.
so,
unless
this
court
acts
as
did
the
district
court
the
legislative
processes
as
in
georgia
are
helpless
to
remedy
this
situation.
if
it
should
go
to
the
general
assembly,
the
general
assembly
will
meet
in
effect
as
a
committee
of
the
whole
or
its
own
electoral
college
solely
for
the
purpose
of
electing
the
governor.
there
would
be
no
debate
under
the
rules
of
the
house,
majority
of
each
house
is
necessarily
constitute
a
forum
but
as
soon
as
that
forum
exists
in
the
house
as
thus
constituted
they
forthwith
proceed
to
elect.
there
would
be
no
review
after
reapportionment.
this
would
carry
until
1968.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
no,
i
haven't
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
frankly,
i
know
of
no
explanation
other
than
that
seems
to
have
been
common
in
similar
provisions
of
other
state
constitutions
which
most
of
which
provided
for
tie
vote
situations
which
never
arose.
i
think
this
was
probably
just
arose
--
copying
from
another
provision.
the
rules
of
the
house
provide
for
division
of
the
house
if
the
voice
vote
should
be
indeterminate.
but
this
isn't
just
simply
not
like
the
normal
legislative
process.
this
is
stopping
the
consequences
of
which
cannot
be
remedied
after
we
achieve
fair
apportionment.
i
would
suggest
then
in
response
to
questions
previously
raised
that
although
the
general
assembly
maybe
--
have
been
approved
both
by
the
district
court
and
by
this
court
on
a
temporary
basis
for
ordinary
legislation.
the
district
court
was
very
emphatic
in
its
language
that
the
present
plan
of
senate
apportionment
in
georgia
and
this
is
the
court
speaking
in
1966
and
the
proposed
plan
of
house
reapportionments
separately
and
collectively
fall
short
of
the
mandate
of
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
below
said
that
a
15%
standard
which
they
said
within
the
circumstances
of
georgia
no
departure
beyond
that
could
be
justified.
more
than
half
of
our
districts
in
the
house
exceed
15%.
more
than
a
third
exceed
20%.
we
have
extremes
of
more
than
40%,
an
extreme
of
more
than
2
to
2.6
to
1
in
the
house.
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
minor
situation
in
an
election.
this
is
far
more
critical
than
in
an
ordinary
legislative
processes.
that's
a
one
man,
one
vote
here.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
say
that
the
significance
to
that
fact
is
that
this
court
under
the
circumstances
which
it
then
foresaw
in
recognizing
its
retained
powers
as
the
court
of
equity
and
that
of
the
district
court.
in
the
event
of
changed
circumstances
to
amend
its
order
in
any
way
if
found
necessary
or
appropriate
but
it
was
alright
to
approve
on
an
interim
basis
for
which
we
could
then
proceed
which
was
ordinary
legislation
for
two
years,
constitutional
apportionment
being
achieved
in
1968.
this
will
not
be
achieved
if
the
general
assembly
is
now
allowed
to
elect
the
governor
who
will
hold
office
until
1971.
court
of
equity
would
have
no
power
in
modifying
this
decree
if
the
circumstance
is
changed.
if
a
new
constitution
were
to
be
proposed,
this
court
has
not
disapproved
that.
and
if
that
occurred,
we
would
expect
someone
to
move
in
the
district
court
to
ensure
the
right
of
people
of
the
future
to
have
an
equal
voice
in
these
major
decisions
and
that
is
one
of
these
decisions
before
the
court
today.
in
conclusion,
we
express
our
appreciation
for
the
opportunity
of
having
this
matter
aired
fully
before
this
court
expeditiously.
the
rights
which
we
assert
are
first
and
foremost
federally
constituted
rights.
the
right
of
the
people
of
a
state
to
elect
their
governor
which
we
feel
will
be
deprived
unless
the
district
court's
decision
is
affirmed.
