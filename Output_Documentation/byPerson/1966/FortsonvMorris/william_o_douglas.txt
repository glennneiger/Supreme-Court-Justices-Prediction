justice
william
o.
douglas
is
this
oath
in
the
record
somewhere?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
it
was
inconclusive
so
i
thought
it
was
still
going
on.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
why
this
case
is
here,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
these
returns
sealed,
is
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
did
you
get
those
figures
if
you
quoted
as,
callaway
so
much,
maddox
so
much?
justice
william
o.
douglas
newspaper?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
assume
--
you
are
saying
there
was
a
slight
deviation
from
the
correct
apportionment
and
due
to
the
fact
i
think
this
court
or
the
district
court
held
it
to
be
invalid,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
order
to
be
constitutionally
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
18
--
1969,
i
think,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
don't
you
go
the
larger
question
counsel
because
i
--
as
i
read
your
brief
that
you're
merely
emphasizing
a
malapportionment
only
aggravates
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
what
you
deemed
to
be
the
unconstitutional
features
anyway.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
not
an
independent
ground.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
--
you're
representing
the
appellees
who
do
not
contend
that
there
is
--
writing
should
be?
justice
william
o.
douglas
see,
the
district
court
didn't
reach
the
remedy?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
don't
claim
here
that
there
should
--
direct
in
terms
of
remedy
any
more
than
a
runoff
between
the
two?
justice
william
o.
douglas
pardon?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
reason
i
asked
you
that
there's
a
specific
georgia
statute
that
deals
with
an
alternative
method
of
doing
this,
do
you
support
that
statute
or
do
you
have
still
a
different
way?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right.
now,
you
stand
by
that
one
do
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
see,
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
think
you
can
do
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
sir.
i
don't.
not
once
you've
opened
up
the
electoral
process
to
the
voters
and
come
down
to
the
final
conclusion.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
an
adoption
appointee?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
does
he
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
he
discussed?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
remember
our
cases
in
this
field,
reynold,
sims,
lucas,
gray
and
sanders,
they
dealt
with
on
a
statewide
election
by
the
people,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
our
question
goes
different.
i
suppose
our
question
is
whether
or
not
this
legislative
stage
is
a
part
of
this
general
election
that
we
have
held
must
be
one
person,
one
vote.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
we
have
a
more
immediate
question
than
that
and
that
is
what
do
you
mean
in
--
all
these
cases
by
saying
one
person,
one
vote?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
the
question
is
then
--
is
this
a
part
of
the
election?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
have
baker
versus
carr.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
to
preserve
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
must
have
had
some
help,
he
didn't
do
that
all
by
himself?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
you
have
to
abandon
your
earlier
argument
that
this
theory,
this
election
by
the
legislature
is
not
a
part
of
the
general
election?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
then,
who
does
it
then
whether
it's
a
legislature
or
other
county
governments
who
select
in
case
of
--?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
is
a

they
are.
