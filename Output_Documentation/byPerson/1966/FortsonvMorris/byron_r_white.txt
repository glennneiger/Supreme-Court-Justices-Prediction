justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hill,
is
you're
suggestion
that
at
least
one
of
the
briefs
i
made
the
democratic
legislator
would
be
oath
bound
to
vote
for
the
democratic
candidate?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
that
if
that's
not
so
that
no
democratic
legislator
would
be
oath
bound
to
support
the
democratic
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
perfectly
free
to
vote
for
the
republican.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we've
said
they're
not
bound
by
it
in
the
situation
in
the
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
was
the
question
of
the
oath
ways
below
--
mr.
hill
in
the
sense
that
it's
argued
in
this
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
referred
doing
--
you've
got
so
much
stuff
here,
i
haven't
been
--
unable
to
go
through
all
of
them
but
the
--
is
that
the
third
one
in
the
opinion
of
the
three-judged
court,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
had
this
election
and
elect
to
the
new
legislature
convenes,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
in
other
words,
what
--
if
this
power
may
be
exercised,
it
has
to
be
exercised
by
the
legislature
which
was
elected
the
same
day
of
the
--
of
this
contest?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
think
if
there
was
a
--
had
to
be
a
runoff
between
the
republican
and
the
democratic
candidates
for
a
lieutenant
governor?
i
suppose
the
subject
--
georgia
statute
requires
the
--
which
provides
for
a
runoff
in
that
respect
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
(voice
overlap)
was
that
the
georgia
statute
which
relating
to
runoff?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
want
to
know
--
what
about
a
runoff
to
the
candidates
for
lieutenant
governor.
let's
just
assume
that
there
was
a
runoff
between
democratic
and
republican
candidates
for
lieutenant
governor
because
of
a
writing,
let's
assume
that.
and
then
the
demo
--
and
then
the
--
do
you
think
the
oath
would
reach
that
special
election
held
to
elect
a
lieutenant
governor?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
almost
have
to
take
a
runoff?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
to
what
does
the
statute
for
a
runoff
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
give
me
an
example,
what
does
it
apply
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
apply
to
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
statewide
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
the
oath
apply
to
them?
but
does
it
--
does
the
oath
requires
support
for
the
democratic
candidates
or
republican?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
just
say
mr.
hill
that
there
variances
as
to
some
counties
between
those
figures
and
what
have
been
reported
by
the
election
officials?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
i'll
ask
you
again,
where
do
we
get
a
case
of
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
still,
the
declaratory
judgment
are
not,
there
still
has
to
be
a
case
of
controversy,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
say
there
was
a
--
let's
assume
that
the
--
we
didn't
decide
this
case
this
time
and
that
the
case
went
on
and
that
the
returns
were
opened
in
the
legislature,
an
election
was
held.
do
you
suppose
the
election
of
the
legislature
could
come
in
a
way
that
would
make
these
cases
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
--
but
both
of
these
--
you
mean
it
became
up
--
you
mean,
if
the
defendants
in
these
suits
--
it
wouldn't
be
moot
for
the
defendants
in
these
suits
that
came
out
one
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
legislature
of
it's
--
to
elect
this
governor,
your
provision
of
doctarine
--
if
the
legislature
that
was
elected
or
was
it
not
under
a
claimant
--
if
the
three-judge
district
court
approved
and
which
this
court
affirmed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
a
constitutionally
elected
legislature
then
its
under
a
constitutional
plan
for
the
purpose,
the
election
in
this
legislature.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
legislature
can
--
makes
the
choice
if
your
constitutional
(inaudible)
is
certainly
for
that
purpose
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
be
making
the
argument
mr.
justice
douglas
indicates
whether
or
not
this
legislature
was
not
apportioned
and
you
would
also
make
the
same
argument
if
there
was
a
tie
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
within
the
popular
vote
and
you
would
say
that
any
provision
over
a
--
or
the
legislature
breaking
a
tie
wherever,
whatever
the
state
--
whatever
the
apportionment
would
be
unconstitutional
in
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
view
mr.
morgan
on
the
--
on
whether
or
not
if
you
win,
if
you
win
there
is
a
special
election
where
there
will
or
will
not
be
a
write-in?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
see
mr.
morgan,
is
this
an
argument
that
the
--
this
expanding
view
has
now
given
a
narrower
definition
to
what
constitutes
a
republican
form
of
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
that
--
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me,
was
--
of
course
this
doesn't
have
to
but
just
a
matter
of
curiosity.
i
--
was
georgia
one
of
the
states
that
was
readmitted
by
a
congressional
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
that
time
i
gather
the
georgia
constitution
had
this
provision
in
it
at
the
time
of
readmission
if
that's
the
right
the
word
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
succeed
with
a
constitution
which
included
this
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
provision
that
dates
1824?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
how
--
when
do
you
--
do
you
suppose
georgia
was
admitted
--
readmitted
as
you
would
call
it
before
or
after
the
induction
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
here
it
was
in
--
fourteenth
amendment
is
which
--
is
what
you
rely
on?
was
--
it
was
ratified
at
the
same
time
as
georgia
was
being
readmitted
with
this
provision
on
its
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
is
respect
to
a
state
now.
this
is
respect
state
procedures
not
federal
procedures.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
i
suppose
the
senators
were
elected
by
state
legislatures
until
1912.
and
i
gather
the
readmission,
i
forgot
whether
--
does
it
formally
or
not
but
when
congress
admits
or
readmits
a
state,
isn't
there
a
judgment
whether
the
submissions
--
submitted
form
of
government
constitutes
a
republican
form
of
government
for
purposes
of
article
iv
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
depends
on
whether
we
have
any
power
to
pass
on
what's
a
republican
form
of
--
or
were
that
exclusively
for
the
congress
(inaudible)--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
a
state
could
not
adopt
the
parliamentary
form
of
a
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
forgive
me
because
i
haven't
asked
you
but
really
so
much
of
this
stiff
like
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
state.
you're
not
the
one
who
argued
that
results
permits
the
legislator
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't
suggest
counsel
then
that
georgia
could
not
constitutionally
have
the
election
of
a
good
governor
by
the
legislature
without
any
popular
votes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
i
personally
don't
think
it's
such
an
abstract
question
and
irrelevant.
i
would
think
if
–
that
if
georgia
could
say,
from
the
very
outset,
we're
going
to
have
the
election
of
governor
for
--
by
the
popular
vote
but
if
it
say
also,
“well,
we're
going
to
have
it
that
way
every
other
year.
and
then
the
off
years,
we're
going
to
have
them
in
the
legislature.”
we'll
also
say
that
if
there's
a
--
that
if
it
say
we're
going
to
have
a
popular
election
as
long
as
there's
a
pure
majority.
and
there
isn't
a
fair
majority
or
if
there's
a
tie.
say,
there's
a
tie,
the
legislature
is
going
to
do
the
job
just
like
it
always
did.
what
about
ties
by
the
way,
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you'd
--
you
wouldn't
like
to
reach
any
of
these
questions
and
i
take
it,
they're
very
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
runoff
elections,
if
you
won,
what's
your
answer
to
all
the
people
who
--
write-in
votes
would
be
thrown
away?
what
about
there
votes
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
saying
if
they
must
vote
for
somebody
they
didn't
want
to
vote
for
in
the
first
place
and
don't
want
to
vote
for
now.
if
they
don't
want
to
vote
now,
stay
home.
that's
your
only
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
very
good
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bondurant,
you
have
this
provision
i
gather
in
the
constitution
in
1870
as
i
understand
it
would
be.
that
time
we
have
the
equal
protection
clause
to
them
–
that
congress
passed
the
legislation
readmitting
georgia?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bondurant
maybe
you
could
help
me.
what's
your
explanation
as
to
why
the
legislature
of
georgia
passed
this
provision
for
a
runoff
election
in
the
face
of
the
constitutional
provision
was
this
in
anticipation
of
the
new
constitution
which
would
not
have
had
this
election
by
the
legislature?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
seems
to
us
--
it
seems
to
assume
of
course
that
it
was
necessary
to
change
the
constitutional
provision
in
order
to
--
for
them
to
be
permitted
to
pass
the
runoff
provisions.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
until
then
there
was
no
provision
for
a
runoff
for
a
governor?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bondurant,
the
three-judged
court
enjoined
the
submission
on
that
new
constitution
of
the
electorate,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
whole
new
--
i'm
a
little
vague
about
this
but
didn't
that
issue
come
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
had
taken
--
if
we
advance
that
case,
maybe
you
wouldn't
be
here
today,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
what
would
you
–
do
you
suppose
the
legislature
would
be
discharging
its
powers
under
the
constitution
or
its
authority
of
it
–
itself,
all
the
runoff
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
plan
were
the
purposes
of
election
of
the
1966
collegium?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
new
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
satisfy
gray
you
have
to
have
three
governors?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hill,
is
you're
suggestion
that
at
least
one
of
the
briefs
i
made
the
democratic
legislator
would
be
oath
bound
to
vote
for
the
democratic
candidate?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
that
if
that's
not
so
that
no
democratic
legislator
would
be

so
that

in

what

may
be

it
has
to
be

by
the

so
that
the
legislature
can
--
makes
the
choice
if
your
constitutional
(inaudible)
is
certainly
for
that
purpose
a
constitutionally
apportioned
legislature,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
be
making
the
argument
mr.
justice
douglas
indicates
whether
or
not
this
legislature
was
not
apportioned
and
you
would
also
make
the
same
argument
if
there
was
a
tie
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
within
the
popular
vote
and
you
would
say
that
any
provision
over
a
--
or
the
legislature
breaking
a
tie
wherever,
whatever
the
state
--
whatever
the
apportionment
would
be
unconstitutional
in
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
view
mr.
morgan
on
the
--
on
whether
or
not
if
you
win,
if
you
win
there
is
a
special
election
where
there
will
or
will
not
be
a
write-in?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
see
mr.
morgan,
is
this
an
argument
that
the
--
this
expanding
view
has
now
given
a
narrower
definition
to
what
constitutes
a
republican
form
of
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
that
--
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me,
was
--
of
course
this
doesn't
have
to
but
just
a
matter
of
curiosity.
i
--
was
georgia
one
of
the
states
that
was
readmitted
by
a
congressional
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
that
time
i
gather
the
georgia
constitution
had
this
provision
in
it
at
the
time
of
readmission
if
that's
the
right
the
word
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
succeed
with
a
constitution
which
included
this
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
provision
that
dates
1824?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
how
--
when
do
you
--
do
you
suppose
georgia
was
admitted
--
readmitted
as
you
would
call
it
before
or
after
the
induction
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
here
it
was
in
--
fourteenth
amendment
is
which
--
is
what
you
rely
on?
was
--
it
was
ratified
at
the
same
time
as
georgia
was
being
readmitted
with
this
provision
on
its
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
is
respect
to
a
state
now.
this
is
respect
state
procedures
not
federal
procedures.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
i
suppose
the
senators
were
elected
by
state
legislatures
until
1912.
and
i
gather
the
readmission,
i
forgot
whether
--
does
it
formally
or
not
but
when
congress
admits
or
readmits
a
state,
isn't
there
a
judgment
whether
the
submissions
--
submitted
form
of
government
constitutes
a
republican
form
of
government
for
purposes
of
article
iv
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
depends
on
whether
we
have
any
power
to
pass
on
what's
a
republican
form
of
--
or
were
that
exclusively
for
the
congress
(inaudible)--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
a
state
could
not
adopt
the
parliamentary
form
of
a
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
forgive
me
because
i
haven't
asked
you
but
really
so
much
of
this
stiff
like
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
state.
you're
not
the
one
who
argued
that
results
permits
the
legislator
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't
suggest
counsel
then
that
georgia
could
not
constitutionally
have
the
election
of
a
good
governor
by
the
legislature
without
any
popular
votes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
i
personally
don't
think
it's
such
an
abstract
question
and
irrelevant.
i
would
think
if
–
that
if
georgia
could
say,
from
the
very
outset,
we're
going
to
have
the
election
of
governor
for
--
by
the
popular
vote
but
if
it
say
also,
“well,
we're
going
to
have
it
that
way
every
other
year.
and
then
the
off
years,
we're
going
to
have
them
in
the
legislature.”
we'll
also
say
that
if
there's
a
--
that
if
it
say
we're
going
to
have
a
popular
election
as
long
as
there's
a
pure
majority.
and
there
isn't
a
fair
majority
or
if
there's
a
tie.
say,
there's
a
tie,
the
legislature
is
going
to
do
the
job
just
like
it
always
did.
what
about
ties
by
the
way,
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you'd
--
you
wouldn't
like
to
reach
any
of
these
questions
and
i
take
it,
they're
very
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
runoff
elections,
if
you
won,
what's
your
answer
to
all
the
people
who
--
write-in
votes
would
be
thrown
away?
what
about
there
votes
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
saying
if
they
must
vote
for
somebody
they
didn't
want
to
vote
for
in
the
first
place
and
don't
want
to
vote
for
now.
if
they
don't
want
to
vote
now,
stay
home.
that's
your
only
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
very
good
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bondurant,
you
have
this
provision
i
gather
in
the
constitution
in
1870
as
i
understand
it
would
be.
that
time
we
have
the
equal
protection
clause
to
them
–
that
congress
passed
the
legislation
readmitting
georgia?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bondurant
maybe
you
could
help
me.
what's
your
explanation
as
to
why
the
legislature
of
georgia
passed
this
provision
for
a
runoff
election
in
the
face
of
the
constitutional
provision
was
this
in
anticipation
of
the
new
constitution
which
would
not
have
had
this
election
by
the
legislature?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
seems
to
us
--
it
seems
to
assume
of
course
that
it
was
necessary
to
change
the
constitutional
provision
in
order
to
--
for
them
to
be
permitted
to
pass
the
runoff
provisions.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
until
then
there
was
no
provision
for
a
runoff
for
a
governor?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bondurant,
the
three-judged
court
enjoined
the
submission
on
that
new
constitution
of
the
electorate,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
whole
new
--
i'm
a
little
vague
about
this
but
didn't
that
issue
come
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
had
taken
--
if
we
advance
that
case,
maybe
you
wouldn't
be
here
today,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
what
would
you
–
do
you
suppose
the
legislature
would
be
discharging
its
powers
under
the
constitution
or
its
authority
of
it
–
itself,
all
the
runoff
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
plan
were
the
purposes
of
election
of
the
1966
collegium?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
new
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
satisfy
gray
you
have
to
have
three
governors?
