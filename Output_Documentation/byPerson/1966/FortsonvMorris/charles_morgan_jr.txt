mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
discussing
i
think
what
the
attorney
general
would
properly
term
a
political
thicket
and
i
shall
think
of
that
would
be
the
position
of
the
state
of
georgia.
in
general,
i
think
that
estranged
as
this
may
sound
now
that
its
much
less
of
a
thicket
here
than
there
is
a
formal
garden.
but
we
intent
to
show
the
court
i
think
if
--
that
it's
conclusion
is
inevitable
under
gray
versus
sanders.
and
that
the
only
path
that
may
be
followed
under
that
rule,
the
rule
of
that
case,
is
to
move
forward
to
the
electorate.
now,
we
do
have
a
distinction
with
the
court
appellee's
justice.
their
contention
will
be
to
take
one
path
to
the
electorate.
ours
will
be
to
take
another.
on
the
statement
regarding
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
case,
we
did
enter
court
on
three
counts
on
a
complaint.
the
first
count
did
allege
malapportionment.
the
second
count
alleged
gray
v.
sanders
grounds
stating
that
malapportionment
was
a
part
of
the
county
unit
system
rule.
and
the
third
ground
was
straight
out
county
unit
question
or
geographical
unit.
i
think
we
turned
it
there.
our
case
and
appellee's
justice
case
agreed
on
that
point
and
that
if
the
point
upon
which
the
court
below
decide
of
this
matter.
now,
we
contend
that
the
malapportionment
of
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
georgia,
matters
in
the
sense
that
it
almost
locks
in
this
instance
the
will
of
a
minority,
the
right
of
a
minority
to
elect
the
governor
of
the
state
of
georgia.
we
don't
contend
that
that's
the
principle
thrust
of
course
the
gray
v.
sanders
case
but
we
think
that's
a
part
of
it.
now,
the
court
below
asked
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
the
question
was
asked
by
the
court
below
this
way
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
court
below
forwarded
to
us
the
following
question
in
the
following
word.
they
said,
“assuming
the
allegations
in
the
claim
that
all
--
are
all
taken
us
true.”
does
the
complaint
alleged
facts
which
entitle
the
complaint
as
to
relief
in
the
light
of
the
prior
decision
of
the
court
in
toombs
versus
fortson
affirmed
by
this
court.
and
whether
this
case
should
not
be
dismissed
on
the
pleadings
or
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
we
discussed
with
the
court
there
the
question
of
the
affirmance
and
the
effect
of
the
order
of
affirmance
by
this
court.
and
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
under
the
earlier
case
where
the
three-judge
court
in
the
toombs
v.
fortson
matter
had
enjoined
the
state
constitutional
provision
or
rather
the
state
--
the
new
state
constitution
proposed
in
1964
and
it
enjoined
the
electorate
--
rather
that
from
being
submitted
to
the
elect
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
by
a
malapportioned
legislature.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
the
court's
reasoning
in
that
case
was
that
it
would
take
a
two-thirds
vote
by
a
properly
apportioned
legislature
to
amend
that
--
to
propose
an
amendment
to
that
new
constitution.
now
that
case
was
the
appealed
here
of
course,
as
it
came
to
this
court
and
then
it
was
sent
back
to
that
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
further
developments
as
to
whether
this
should
be
the
ongoing
injunction.
now
in
this
case,
the
power
of
the
governor
is
of
course
much
different
from
ordinary
legislative
matters
just
as
the
state
constitutional
provisions
were
there
and
the
governor
for
instance
in
this
instance
would
be
selected
to
serve
until
1971.
now
in
the
lower
court,
we
got
the
position
of
--
here
we
--
he
would
have
a
malapportioned
governor
whatever
that
means
but
we
have
a
governor
elected
by
a
malapportioned
legislature
who
served
two
years
beyond
the
new
legislature
that's
probably
apportioned
would
take
office.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
i
think
then
you
get
to
the
general,
the
position
that
mr.
justice
harlan
took
which
was
that
it
--
once
the
legislature
was
empowered,
you
know
to
continue
to
operate
that
it
had
the
right
to
do
anything
in
the
former
case,
the
fortson
v.
toombs.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir
we
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i'd
say
under
the
same
reason
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
aggravates
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
response
to
this
then
moving
on
the
--
we
merely
say
that
with
respect
to
state
constitution
under
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
in
toombs
v.
fortson
and
in
this
court
fortson
v.
toombs
but
that's
a
special
kind
of
thing,
that
two-two
thirds
operation.
that
two-thirds
vote
that
would
be
required
to
amend
the
state
constitution
that
here
we'd
have
a
governor
elected
by
a
malapportioned
legislature
from
1969
to
1971.
with
the
power
of
veto
over
it
then
properly
apportioned
legislature
and
that's
not
the
kind
of
matter
that
this
legislature
could
consider.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
would
--
i
pretty
won't
have
to
take
that
position.
i
don't
know
that
i
want
to
reach
the
tie
provisions
of
the
(inaudible)
state
constitutions
aren't
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
--
i
hope
not.
i
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
it
have
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
that's
right.
the
complaint
did
bring
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
the
court
--
we
have
not
filed
a
cross-appeal
in
the
court
below
decided
under
count
three
which
was
straight
gray
v.
sanders
county
unit
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
no,
no
sir,
i
think
that
that
--
if
you
decide
the
other
against
us,
either
this
court
or
the
court
below
on
remand
would
have
to
decide
that
question.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
had
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
not
reaching
that
question
but
just
you
--
that
question
becoming
an
aggravating
point
on
the
gray
versus
sanders,
i
think
the
rule
of
gray
versus
sanders
clearly
envelops
this
case
here.
gray
involved
the
county
units
systems,
the
nominating
procedure
before
we
ever
got
to
the
final
step
of
election
before
we
got
to
the
november
8
general
election.
if
there
is
a
distinction
and
i
think
there
is.
the
general
election
is
the
final
step
and
the
most
important
step
in
the
state
electoral
process.
once
the
voter
leaves
the
polling
place
and
the
curtains
come
down,
it's
over
as
far
as
he's
concern.
he's
made
his
final
choice
and
this
--
to
consider
in
this
circumstance
in
essence
that
a
geographically
apportioned
body
even
if
properly
apportioned
could
select
the
governor.
and
then
we've
got
the
instinctive
and
immediate
problems
that
arise
of
--
that
arose
in
the
county
unit
system
in
gray
v.
sanders.
and
what
are
those
problems?
the
first
one
is
that
if
a
legislature
voted
either
way
he
would
automatically
deprive
those
constituents
who
did
not
agree
with
his
vote
of
any
right
to
have
their
ballots
counted
in
the
selection
of
governor.
if
that
person
in
the
general
assembly
absent
of
himself,
of
course
that'd
be
no
representation
for
the
voters
from
his
district.
he
could
vote
for
a
candidate
who
did
not
received
the
majority
of
votes
in
his
district
as
well
as
the
candidate
who
did
not
receive
of
majority
of
votes
in
the
state.
he
could
elect
the
man
who
ran
number
two
and
completely,
it
deprives
the
voter
of
that
direct
voice
in
the
selection
of
a
statewide
officer
after
the
class
of
those
selectee.
that
officer
has
already
been
determined,
that
class
of
the
voters
of
georgia.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
sir
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
compelled
to
continue
to
have
elections
after
it
had
--
we're
talking
of
a
general
election
not
of
course
the
primary.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
should
think
that
that
--
i
should
think
first
of
all
and
if
i
may
take
this
a
little
backwards.
we
--
where
we
disagree
amongst
appellee
is
as
to
the
remedy
to
be
followed
of
course
and
that's
they
say
a
runoff
provision
under
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
yes,
sir
i
am.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
state
of
georgia
would
then
have
to
have
a
special
election.
there're
two
ways
that
this
could
be
arranged.
they
would
have
to
have
a
runoff
from
the
first
election
if
it
result
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
i
think
georgia
is
required
by
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
i
find
this.
i
find
in
the
gray
case
that
once
the
georgia
has
fixed
those
who
will
elect
the
governor
that
they
then
can't
dilute
or
filter
their
votes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
will
up
against
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
will
be
filtered
if
they
get
to
the
general
assembly.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
prior
to
that
time
then
--
in
a
legislative
selection
i
do
think
that
once
they've
fixed
it
and
they
say
that
you're
going
to
have
it
--
a
november
general
election
that
you
could
have
a
runoff
election
from
there,
from
a
general
election.
and
in
that
election
i
should
think
that
you
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
then
we've
got
a
problem
of
course
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
no,
now
georgia
would
say,
a
runoff
election
between
the
highest
candidates.
our
contention
would
be
that
you
can
have
a
runoff
election
from
a
general
election
that's
conducted
fairly.
that
the
voters
can
contemplate
what
the
law
is
and
then
move
forward
and
have
that
runoff
election.
we
contend
you
can't
do
it
in
this
sentence
because
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i've
--
i
should
think
that
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
they'd
get
a
majority
between
two
men.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
and
then
we
get
to
the
problem
of
majority's
right
to
rule
versus
the
minority's
right
to
reject
and
that's
a
very
difficult
position.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i'm
representing
--
may
i
state
the
position
i
think
of
the
parties
here.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
represent
two
voters
who
represent
a
class.
these
two
voters
did
cast
write-in
the
ballots.
they
don't
--
if
they
want
to
cast
them
in
the
future
or
do
not
want
to
cast
them
in
the
future.
we
do
not
represent
the
write-in
georgia
group.
we
request
that
they
intervene
in
the
case
so
that
they
could
defend
right
to
the
ultimate,
the
right
of
a
person
to
write
in
any
election.
they
did
file
an
intervention
petition
which
was
not
acted
upon.
james
o'hear
sanders
of
the
sanders
versus
gray
case
is
the
plaintiff
in
that
intervention.
co-appellees
represent
a
bipartisan
group
of
georgia
citizens
who
generally
supported
one
of
the
candidates
in
the
campaign.
our
position
is
that
the
--
we're
trying
to
--
as
we
--
well,
everybody
in
the
case
says
that
they
represent
the
people
of
georgia.
of
course,
the
attorney
general
does
and
they
do
and
we
do
and
we
do
have
a
different
standing
on
what
that
requires
that's
what
i
gather
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
i
certainly
do.
yes,
sir.
most
extraneously.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir,
very
much
so.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
have
a
different
statute.
we
have
34-1514
as
the
runoff
statute.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
stand
by
34-1515
which
is
the
special
election
statute.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
there's
a
special
--
i
think
the
problem
in
georgia
--
this
is
as
a
practical
matter.
i
think
the
problem
in
georgia
with
the
respect
to
the
write-in
movement
in
the
--
this
is
the
first
time
this
has
happen
just
like
this
is
the
first
time
is
going
to
state
--
general
assembly.
and
the
problem
in
georgia
as
i
understand
it
was
the
people
felt
like
they
were
dealt
with
unfairly
in
the
electoral
process
and
they
move
forward
from
that
position
to
have
a
write-in
campaign.
in
a
special
election
in
georgia
under
the
georgia
statutes,
the
nominees
of
the
major
parties
would
appear
on
the
ballot
without
new
primaries.
others
could
qualify
to
run
for
governor
of
georgia
from
that
you
would
have
a
runoff
and
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
questions
as
to
the
un
--
what
some
voters
considered
unfairness
earlier
in
the
electoral
process.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
really
don't
because
i
think
it
will
be
over
with
and
it's
really
a
question
that
i'd
--
i
want
to
avoid
as
much
as
i
think
the
court
may
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
he
--
i
should
think
he
would.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
sir,
i
don't
find
a
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
that
would
tell
me
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional
unless
it
happens
to
be
that
as
mr.
justice
douglas
stated
in
his
opinion
in
gray
versus
sanders.
there
has
been
a
developing
thing
and
the
right
to
vote
in
this
country.
and
it's
a
--
the
right
to
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
think
that
this
court
has
had
a
more
--
has
had
an
expanding
view
of
the
right
of
suffrage
in
america.
and
i
think
that
that
expanding
with
this
certainly
shown
up
in
recent
years
in
the
case
of
baker
versus
carr,
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
beyond.
i
think
that
the
--
but
not
merely
this
court
but
other
branches
of
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
and
i
don't
say,
i
don't
find
a
specific
reference
to
that.
but
i
should
think
it
would
have
to
rely
upon
whatever
expanding
view
we
could
find.
we
find
that
in
congress
of
course
but
you
know
the
increase
of
(inaudible)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
certainly
do.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
it
--
it's
not
an
argument
i
intended
to
make
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that's
where
we
--
this
is
almost
what
we've
--
we
lead
to
as
we
moved
forward
either
that
or
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
didn't.
as
i
recall
it,
readmission
--
i'm
really
not
certain
of
this
but
it's
my
best
recollection
that
georgia
had
difficulty
gaining
readmission
in
the
congress.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i'm
really
not
sure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
must
have
been
in
the
constitution
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
georgia
was
readmitted
as
a
part
of
the
adoption,
was
it
not?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
it's
a
--
as
a
part
of
a
condition.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
now
here
we
go
back
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
reynolds
versus
sims.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
fine.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
a
judgment
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
i
did
not
think
could
foreclose
this
court
from
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we're
trying.
but
as
i
say
we
haven't
raise
this
question
here
as
much
as
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i've
--
i
really
find
myself
almost
being
forced
into
that
position
and
that
i'm
almost
into
it
i
want
to
get
out
of
it
and
i
don't
want
to
argue
that,
frankly.
now
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
come
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
to
take
it
that
way,
how
would
the
state
to
get
to
--
i'm
asking
myself
questions
as
i
go,
how
would
the
state
get
to
that
sort
of
a
system?
it
would
get
to
that
sort
of
system
by
its
state
constitution.
state
constitution
will
be
voted
upon
by
the
people.
i
should
think
that
this
would
be
the
declaration
of
the
right
to
vote
by
the
people
themselves
and
under
lucas
versus
colorado
it
might
be
forbidden
--
might
be
forbidden
under
the
lucas-colorado
case.
now,
we
know
that
federal
analogies
are
inapposite.
we
know
that
through
gray
v.sanders
and
reynolds
versus
sims.
we
come
to
this
court
asking
this
court
for
more
than
merely
a
ruling
on
what
the
lower
court
did
below
and
we
ask
it
for
guidance.
now,
we
understand
that
fully
that
this
court
does
not
render
advisory
opinions
but
it
does
render
opinions.
and
we
think
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
all
georgia
voters
and
in
the
interest
of
federal
judiciary
and
the
state
judicial
system
also
that
where
constitutional
questions
as
such
as
this
come
up.
that
whatever
the
opinion
the
court
renders
is
--
that
at
least
indicate
some
sort
of
rules
for
people
as
to
what
they
cannot
do
at
least.
in
light
of
that
we
want
to
refer
to
the
federal
analogy
of
the
state
constitutional
provisions
that
mr.
hill
referred
to
in
his
opening
argument.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
certainty
in
american
government.
there
is
certainly
a
certainty
with
respect
to
the
way
the
state
capital
appears.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
on
the
matter
that
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
on
case
of
controversy,
i
think
it
related
to
the
election
results
and
returns
from
the
fact
that
they're
opened
at
a
later
time
under
section
34-1506
(c)
of
the
georgia
election
code.
the
--
a
copy
of
those
returns
that
are
transmitted
to
the
secretary
of
state
are
retained
by
the
election
officials
themselves.
so,
an
exact
copy
can
be
obtained
of
what
the
--
those
returns
are.
under
section
34-403
of
the
georgia
election
code,
those
returns
are
subject
to
public
inspection.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
are
not
in
the
record,
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i've
said
judicial
knowledge
or
common
knowledge
that
there
was
not
a
majority
obtained
regardless
of
who
was
the
high
candidate.
now,
and
regarding
a
case
of
controversy
question
of
course
i
can
assure
the
court
there
is
a
controversy
going
on
in
georgia
and
that
the
stakes
are
rather
high.
the
problem
i
want
to
discuss
with
the
court
now
if
we
might
is
the
certainty
that
existed
in
the
georgia
constitution
before
the
district
court
ruling.
assuming
that
this
court
affirmed
that
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
remedy
to
be
affected
by
a
court
or
by
the
state
--
general
assembly
itself
or
by
a
state
court
either
by
this
court
or
the
district
court
below.
whoever
decides
how
the
governor
of
georgia
is
to
be
elected?
the
certainty
of
the
constitutional
provision
that
was
in
effect
has
a
great
deal
of
bearing
to
do
with
this
case.
now
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
surely,
i
know.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
did
not
the
raise
that
question.
i
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
don't
really.
ray
versus
blair
of
course,
again
it's
a
federal
analogy
question
going
into
the
electoral
college
question.
i
really
haven't
concede
that
this
oath
by
its
terms
other
than
one
of
a
moral
obligation
it
imposes
upon
the
person
who
takes
it.
that
this
oath
by
some
terms
does
extend
beyond
that
november
8th
general
election
and
i
do
believe
that
that
november
8th
general
election
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
and
for
the
--
other
purposes
is
over
now.
i
would
pretty
much
take
this
position
of
the
state
i
believe
on
that
especially
because
i'm
going
to
be
discussing
now
what
i
think
ought
to
happen
and
what
has
to
happen
because
there's
many
thorny
constitutional
questions
i
believe
in
the
way
you
finally
get
a
governor
of
georgia
as
are
initially
looking
forward
to
the
affirmance
of
the
court
decision
below.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
so
because
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir,
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
alright.
with
respect
to
the
entire
electoral
process
that
went
on
in
georgia,
it's
very
difficult
of
course
in
any
case
of
this
type
to
make
a
record
as
to
what
voters
intend
in
any
election
contest
case.
it's
always
difficult
to
say
that
a
certain
number
of
voters
would
have
voted
another
way
or
did
vote
another
way
because
that
sort
of
proceeding
is
always
open
to
perjury
as
to
what
people
say
their
intentions
were
and
what
they
were
going
to
do?
we've
tried
to
take
the
case
of
davis
versus
schnell
and
to
utilize
some
of
the
techniques
there
used
to
show
the
intention
of
the
legislature
and
the
electorate
regarding
this
general
election.
now
it's
our
contention
generally
that
the
election
was
held
under
the
provisions
of
the
georgia
constitution.
and
the
attorney
general
of
georgia
issued
an
attorney
general's
opinion
were
not
the
supporters
of
mr.
callaway
and
not
the
supporters
of
mr.
maddox
but
the
supporters
as
to
the
write-in
movement
went
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
said,
“look,
we
think
that
we
can
have
a
runoff
from
this
election
and
that's
what
we
want.”
and
at
that
point,
the
attorney
general
of
georgia
issued
an
official
opinion
saying
that
the
runoff
statute
did
not
jive
with
the
constitution
of
georgia
and
they
couldn't
have
a
runoff
election.
now
from
that
point
on,
there'd
became
a
great
misleading
of
the
electorate
of
georgia
and
that
misleading
was
not
a
venal
misleading.
it
wasn't
done
by
the
candidates
deliberately
or
the
press
deliberately,
by
the
attorney
general
georgia
deliberately,
it's
just
the
state
constitution
conflicted
with
the
state's
statute
his
interpretation.
he
said,
“state
constitution
would
prevail
and
this
election
would
go
to
the
state
legislature.”
now,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
that?
well,
i
think
its
common
knowledge
that
in
politics
you
often
have
the
argument
or
question
with
respect
to
the
lesser
of
two
evils.
this
candidate
is
the
less
of
--
lesser
in
two
evils
in
every
state
and
in
every
national
election.i'm
sure
that
argument
is
made.
but
in
thiselection
it
went
further
than
that.
it
was
commonly
argued
in
the
state
of
georgia
that
in
the
event
that
you
vote
for
a
write-in
candidate
whether
with
mr.
arnall
or
anybody
else,
you
thereby
contribute
to
the
election
of
mr.
maddox
because
when
you
do
that,
if
there's
no
majority,
it
will
go
the
general
assembly
and
there
mr.
maddox
will
get
a
second
chance
based
upon
the
oath
that
was
already
taken
in
the
democratic
predominance
in
the
general
assembly.
now,
this
had
an
effect
on
that
election
which
was
such
as
to
render
the
november
8th
proceeding
invalid
and
void
and
to
constitute
a
total
failure
of
election
because
--
due
to
the
misleading
that
election
could
not
be
a
proper
election
for
nominating
the
two
candidates
who
either
the
legislature
could
select
or
the
people
of
georgia
could
vote
on
at
a
later
time.
now
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
there
would
not
be
any
misleading
under
those
circumstances.
and
this
portion
of
the
argument
goes
only
to
the
--
based
on
the
assumptions
that
this
court
affirmed
the
district
court
below.
now,
the
influence
on
that
voter
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
no.
no
sir,
no
sir,
not
at
all.
i
don't
mean
to
(inaudible).
but
they
--
what
i
think
we
do
--
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
respect
to
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not,
the
principal
question
before
the
court
or
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
this
court
affirms
or
perhaps
overrules
or
overturns
or
remands
the
case,
you
know
for
other
proceedings.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
its
relevance
here
is
with
respect
to
what
opinion
this
court
might
write
as
to
the
kind
of
remedy
that
the
parties
below
might
receive
in
the
event
the
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
in
reynolds
versus
sims
the
ruling
of
this
court
made
alabama
hold
--
have
its
legislature
go
into
a
special
session
at
least
twice.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
sir
they
didn't.
and
i
think
reynolds
versus
sims
is
the
best
answer
to
the
political
thicket
question
i've
ever
seen
because
if
there's
ever
been
a
place
where
i
felt
like
we'd
have
trouble
with
that
decision
that
was
the
place
and
though
--
and
there
are
a
lot
of
television
commentaries
and
speeches
and
everything
else
but
by
(inaudible)
they
went
along.
and
after
they
passed
a
couple
of
laws,
the
district
court
below
in
the
--
what
then
became
sims
versus
baggett
ruled
and
we
got
a
properly
apportioned
state
legislature.
now,
and
i
think
that
the
same
thing
happens
here.
i
think
this
court
just
to
conjure
up
the
problems
that
may
confront
it
and
i
hate
to
do
that
but
i
-
to
the
gander
--
candor,
i
think
i
have
to.
to
conjure
up
the
problems
of
affirming
the
district
court,
these
are
the
kinds
of
problems
the
court
may
face.
first
of
all,
what
is
the
right
to
cast
a
write-in
the
ballot?
now,
most
of
the
cases
that
i
have
read
with
respect
to
this
right
arose
at
the
time
the
australian
ballot
was
being
adopted
in
this
country
or
seemed
to
have
risen
about
that
time.
and
this
right
to
cast
a
write-in
ballot
is
the
right
of
a
voter
to
reject
the
nominees
trust
upon
him
by
the
major
parties
or
by
any
other
nominating
process.
now,
repeatedly
throughout
the
history
of
this
country,
we've
had
recurrent
efforts
to
bar
minority
groups
in
the
ballot.
now,
we
have
laws
all
across
the
country
that
provides
certain
requirements
for
a
group
to
come
to
the
floor
to
get
on
the
ballot
via
percent
of
the
vote
in
the
last
election,
10%
whatever
it
may
be.
now,
the
right
to
vote
is
the
most
personal
right
a
man
has.
i
know
in
harper
versus
virginia
state
board
of
election
this
court
stated
that
it
didn't
reach
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
of
free
expression
and
then
went
ahead
to
decide
the
case.
well
in
this
instance,
we
obviously
have
voters
in
georgia
and
i'm
not
just
contending
there's
been
a
misleading
of
just
the
people
who
voted
for
the
write-in
thicket
or
just
the
ons
who
voted
for
the
callaway
thicket
or
just
the
ones
who
go
to
the
maddox
thicket.
i
think
it's
been
misleading
of
all
the
voters
in
georgia.
but
in
georgia,
we
had
some
voters
who
just
said,
“no.
one
time
in
our
lives
we're
not
going
to
say
the
lesser
of
two
evils.
we're
going
to
vote
who
we
want
to
vote
for
and
we're
going
to
do
it
by
very
cumbersome
procedure
and
we're
going
to
express
ourselves.”
and
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
sir,
as
i
understand
that
the
three
states
now
that
do
prevent
write-in
votes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
we're
taking
the
pos
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
we're
not.
our
co-appellees
in
--
the
co-appellees
just
--
just
are
taking
the
position
that
this
court
or
the
district
courts
below
should
bar
write-in
votes
in
a
runoff
election
between
the
two
men
who
ran
on
november
8th.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
a
state
election.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.and
the
state
attorney
general
has
taken
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
pretty
strong
medicine
for
me,
yes
sir.
and
the
state
attorney
general
has
taken
the
position
that
the
right
to
cast
write-in
ballots
is
a
constitutional
right
in
the
state
of
georgia
under
the
state
constitution.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
understand.
i'm
in
complete
agreement
that's
a
pretty
strong
thing.
now,
we
do
have
a
majority
of
the
american
states
of
course
which
have
a
plurality
system
and
you
can
see
and
conjure
ahead
a
conflict
between
the
minority
right
to
reject
and
the
majority
right
to
elect.
as
i
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
awhile
ago,
i
don't
think
that
this
problem
would
come
up
because
of
the
--
you
know
because
of
a
circumstances
below.
i
don't
think
we'd
have
another
write-in
movement
if
we
have
a
special
election.
i
think
we
do
have
a
great
problem.
if
a
court
of
the
united
states
or
really
any
other
governmental
agency
should
arrange
a
procedure
by
some
sort
of
ex
post
facto
process
of
nominating
who
the
people
can
vote
for
and
declining
to
allow
them
to
have
a
right
to
reject
those
nominees
and
vote.
alright,
i
know
the
status'
content
in
its
brief,
the
voters
in
this
--
in
georgia
were
not
misled.
somehow
they
were
to
be
clairvoyant
and
they
were
to
assume
that
the
state
constitutional
provision
would
be
thrown
out
and
that
their
own
attorney
general
was
wrong.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
point
well
made.
i
think
that
the
--
that
what
we
have
here
and
i
just
want
to
use
this
example
to
demonstrate
upon
my
--
the
kind
of
misleading
that
just
take
place.
dr.
benjamin
(inaudible)
in
georgia
is
a
man
perhaps
known
to
the
court.
he
president
of
morehouse
college,
then
there's
this
--
middle
of
the
1930s
as
president.
has
a
phd
degree
and
in
a
clipping
attached
in
our
brief
which
is
in
the
record
below.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
he
stated
on
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
in
the
atlanta
journal
of
october
11th,
“i
am
in
sympathy
with
the
statewide
grass
roots
campaign
to
elect
ellis
arnall.”
now
24
days
later,
november
4th
in
the
atlanta
daily
world
which
the
negro
daily
newspaper
with
the
circulation
of
30,500,
this
man
who
has
19
honorary
degrees
stated,
“after
much
searching
of
soul,
i
think
the
write-in
might
contribute
to
the
election
of
the
man
i
fear
would
set
our
state
back.”
if
mr.
arnall
pulled
a
heavy
vote
and
the
election
were
thrown
into
the
legislature,
mr.
maddox
would
be
governor.
this
is
a
hard
decision
to
make
but
i
make
it.
he
then
proceeded
to
endorse
mr.
callaway.
now
this
gentleman,
the
president
of
a
major
negro
educational
institution
is
a
plaintiff
in
the
justice
case.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
he
was
misled
and
if
a
man
with
a
phd
from
the
university
of
chicago
and
19
honorary
degrees
was
misled
then
what
of
the
135,000
voters
in
the
state
of
georgia
who
were
registered
to
vote
under
the
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
since
that
time.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
they
may
have
but
i
think
of
that
perticularly
is
that
they
all
usually
go
to
the
same
side.
i
want
to
conclude
now
by
saying
this
we
do
have
an
important
case
before
the
court
and
all
of
us
recognized
that.
this
is
the
case
in
which
we've
all
worked
rather
hard
during
the
last
few
weeks.
it's
a
case
which
this
court
has
moved
to
here
rapidly.
it's
a
case
in
which
the
attorney
general
of
georgia
wants
a
decision
immediately.
and
it's
a
cases
in
which
co-appellees
want
a
decision
immediately
and
it's
a
case
in
which
we
want
a
decision.
when
a
decision
can
be
reached
taking
into
consideration
the
constitutional
rights
of
all
the
parties
involved.
there
is
a
need
for
haste
in
the
case
but
not
for
undo
haste.
i
think
that
this
court
recognizes
that
there
are
complete
--
competing
and
conflicting
interest
here.
they're
really
vital
to
4
million
people
and
perhaps
to
people
in
other
states
even
though
almost
all
of
them
have
plurality
provisions
for
the
election
of
governor.
so
consequently
i
would
urged
the
court
that
there's
no
possibility
of
a
breakdown
on
the
government
of
georgia.
now,
there's
no
anarchy
there.
there's
nobody
proposing
that
we
don't
--
that
the
government's
falling.
i
want
to
express
our
appreciation
for
the
rapidity
which
the
court
has
heard
the
case
and
also
for
the
courtesy
which
we
have
received
from
counsel
on
all
side
in
this
matter.
i
know
that
this
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
stated
that
and
i
thought
well
said
stated,
“we
are
cautioned
about
the
dangers
of
entering
into
political
thickets
and
mathematical
quagmires.”
our
answer
is
this,
“but
a
dial
of
constitutionally
protected
rights,
the
man's
judicial
protection,
our
oath
and
our
office
require
no
less
of
us.”
thank
you.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
discussing
i
think
what
the
attorney
general
would
properly
term
a
political
thicket
and
i
shall
think
of
that
would
be
the
position
of
the
state
of
georgia.
in
general,
i
think
that
estranged
as
this
may
sound
now
that
its
much
less
of
a
thicket
here
than
there
is
a
formal
garden.
but
we
intent
to
show
the
court
i
think
if
--
that
it's
conclusion
is
inevitable
under
gray
versus
sanders.
and
that
the
only
path
that
may
be
followed
under
that
rule,
the
rule
of
that
case,
is
to
move
forward
to
the
electorate.
now,
we
do
have
a
distinction
with
the
court
appellee's
justice.
their
contention
will
be
to
take
one
path
to
the
electorate.
ours
will
be
to
take
another.
on
the
statement
regarding
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
case,
we
did
enter
court
on
three
counts
on
a
complaint.
the
first
count
did
allege
malapportionment.
the
second
count
alleged
gray
v.
sanders
grounds
stating
that
malapportionment
was
a
part
of
the
county
unit
system
rule.
and
the
third
ground
was
straight
out
county
unit
question
or
geographical
unit.
i
think
we
turned
it
there.
our
case
and
appellee's
justice
case
agreed
on
that
point
and
that
if
the
point
upon
which
the
court
below
decide
of
this
matter.
now,
we
contend
that
the
malapportionment
of
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
georgia,
matters
in
the
sense
that
it
almost
locks
in
this
instance
the
will
of
a
minority,
the
right
of
a
minority
to
elect
the
governor
of
the
state
of
georgia.
we
don't
contend
that
that's
the
principle
thrust
of
course
the
gray
v.
sanders
case
but
we
think
that's
a
part
of
it.
now,
the
court
below
asked
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
the
question
was
asked
by
the
court
below
this
way
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
court
below
forwarded
to
us
the
following
question
in
the
following
word.
they
said,
“assuming
the
allegations
in
the
claim
that
all
--
are
all
taken
us
true.”
does
the
complaint
alleged
facts
which
entitle
the
complaint
as
to
relief
in
the
light
of
the
prior
decision
of
the
court
in
toombs
versus
fortson
affirmed
by
this
court.
and
whether
this
case
should
not
be
dismissed
on
the
pleadings
or
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
we
discussed
with
the
court
there
the
question
of
the
affirmance
and
the
effect
of
the
order
of
affirmance
by
this
court.
and
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
under
the
earlier
case
where
the
three-judge
court
in
the
toombs
v.
fortson
matter
had
enjoined
the
state
constitutional
provision
or
rather
the
state
--
the
new
state
constitution
proposed
in
1964
and
it
enjoined
the
electorate
--
rather
that
from
being
submitted
to
the
elect
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
by
a
malapportioned
legislature.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
the
court's
reasoning
in
that
case
was
that
it
would
take
a
two-thirds
vote
by
a
properly
apportioned
legislature
to
amend
that
--
to
propose
an
amendment
to
that
new
constitution.
now
that
case
was
the
appealed
here
of
course,
as
it
came
to
this
court
and
then
it
was
sent
back
to
that
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
further
developments
as
to
whether
this
should
be
the
ongoing
injunction.
now
in
this
case,
the
power
of
the
governor
is
of
course
much
different
from
ordinary
legislative
matters
just
as
the
state
constitutional
provisions
were
there
and
the
governor
for
instance
in
this
instance
would
be
selected
to
serve
until
1971.
now
in
the
lower
court,
we
got
the
position
of
--
here
we
--
he
would
have
a
malapportioned
governor
whatever
that
means
but
we
have
a
governor
elected
by
a
malapportioned
legislature
who
served
two
years
beyond
the
new
legislature
that's
probably
apportioned
would
take
office.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
i
think
then
you
get
to
the
general,
the
position
that
mr.
justice
harlan
took
which
was
that
it
--
once
the
legislature
was
empowered,
you
know
to
continue
to
operate
that
it
had
the
right
to
do
anything
in
the
former
case,
the
fortson
v.
toombs.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir
we
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i'd
say
under
the
same
reason
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
aggravates
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
response
to
this
then
moving
on
the
--
we
merely
say
that
with
respect
to
state
constitution
under
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
in
toombs
v.
fortson
and
in
this
court
fortson
v.
toombs
but
that's
a
special
kind
of
thing,
that
two-two
thirds
operation.
that
two-thirds
vote
that
would
be
required
to
amend
the
state
constitution
that
here
we'd
have
a
governor
elected
by
a
malapportioned
legislature
from
1969
to
1971.
with
the
power
of
veto
over
it
then
properly
apportioned
legislature
and
that's
not
the
kind
of
matter
that
this
legislature
could
consider.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
would
--
i
pretty
won't
have
to
take
that
position.
i
don't
know
that
i
want
to
reach
the
tie
provisions
of
the
(inaudible)
state
constitutions
aren't
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
--
i
hope
not.
i
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
it
have
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
that's
right.
the
complaint
did
bring
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
the
court
--
we
have
not
filed
a
cross-appeal
in
the
court
below
decided
under
count
three
which
was
straight
gray
v.
sanders
county
unit
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
no,
no
sir,
i
think
that
that
--
if
you
decide
the
other
against
us,
either
this
court
or
the
court
below
on
remand
would
have
to
decide
that
question.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
had
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
not
reaching
that
question
but
just
you
--
that
question
becoming
an
aggravating
point
on
the
gray
versus
sanders,
i
think
the
rule
of
gray
versus
sanders
clearly
envelops
this
case
here.
gray
involved
the
county
units
systems,
the
nominating
procedure
before
we
ever
got
to
the
final
step
of
election
before
we
got
to
the
november
8
general
election.
if
there
is
a
distinction
and
i
think
there
is.
the
general
election
is
the
final
step
and
the
most
important
step
in
the
state
electoral
process.
once
the
voter
leaves
the
polling
place
and
the
curtains
come
down,
it's
over
as
far
as
he's
concern.
he's
made
his
final
choice
and
this
--
to
consider
in
this
circumstance
in
essence
that
a
geographically
apportioned
body
even
if
properly
apportioned
could
select
the
governor.
and
then
we've
got
the
instinctive
and
immediate
problems
that
arise
of
--
that
arose
in
the
county
unit
system
in
gray
v.
sanders.
and
what
are
those
problems?
the
first
one
is
that
if
a
legislature
voted
either
way
he
would
automatically
deprive
those
constituents
who
did
not
agree
with
his
vote
of
any
right
to
have
their
ballots
counted
in
the
selection
of
governor.
if
that
person
in
the
general
assembly
absent
of
himself,
of
course
that'd
be
no
representation
for
the
voters
from
his
district.
he
could
vote
for
a
candidate
who
did
not
received
the
majority
of
votes
in
his
district
as
well
as
the
candidate
who
did
not
receive
of
majority
of
votes
in
the
state.
he
could
elect
the
man
who
ran
number
two
and
completely,
it
deprives
the
voter
of
that
direct
voice
in
the
selection
of
a
statewide
officer
after
the
class
of
those
selectee.
that
officer
has
already
been
determined,
that
class
of
the
voters
of
georgia.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
sir
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
compelled
to
continue
to
have
elections
after
it
had
--
we're
talking
of
a
general
election
not
of
course
the
primary.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
should
think
that
that
--
i
should
think
first
of
all
and
if
i
may
take
this
a
little
backwards.
we
--
where
we
disagree
amongst
appellee
is
as
to
the
remedy
to
be
followed
of
course
and
that's
they
say
a
runoff
provision
under
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
yes,
sir
i
am.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
state
of
georgia
would
then
have
to
have
a
special
election.
there're
two
ways
that
this
could
be
arranged.
they
would
have
to
have
a
runoff
from
the
first
election
if
it
result
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
i
think
georgia
is
required
by
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
i
find
this.
i
find
in
the
gray
case
that
once
the
georgia
has
fixed
those
who
will
elect
the
governor
that
they
then
can't
dilute
or
filter
their
votes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
will
up
against
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
will
be
filtered
if
they
get
to
the
general
assembly.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
prior
to
that
time
then
--
in
a
legislative
selection
i
do
think
that
once
they've
fixed
it
and
they
say
that
you're
going
to
have
it
--
a
november
general
election
that
you
could
have
a
runoff
election
from
there,
from
a
general
election.
and
in
that
election
i
should
think
that
you
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
then
we've
got
a
problem
of
course
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
no,
now
georgia
would
say,
a
runoff
election
between
the
highest
candidates.
our
contention
would
be
that
you
can
have
a
runoff
election
from
a
general
election
that's
conducted
fairly.
that
the
voters
can
contemplate
what
the
law
is
and
then
move
forward
and
have
that
runoff
election.
we
contend
you
can't
do
it
in
this
sentence
because
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i've
--
i
should
think
that
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
they'd
get
a
majority
between
two
men.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
and
then
we
get
to
the
problem
of
majority's
right
to
rule
versus
the
minority's
right
to
reject
and
that's
a
very
difficult
position.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i'm
representing
--
may
i
state
the
position
i
think
of
the
parties
here.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
represent
two
voters
who
represent
a
class.
these
two
voters
did
cast
write-in
the
ballots.
they
don't
--
if
they
want
to
cast
them
in
the
future
or
do
not
want
to
cast
them
in
the
future.
we
do
not
represent
the
write-in
georgia
group.
we
request
that
they
intervene
in
the
case
so
that
they
could
defend
right
to
the
ultimate,
the
right
of
a
person
to
write
in
any
election.
they
did
file
an
intervention
petition
which
was
not
acted
upon.
james
o'hear
sanders
of
the
sanders
versus
gray
case
is
the
plaintiff
in
that
intervention.
co-appellees
represent
a
bipartisan
group
of
georgia
citizens
who
generally
supported
one
of
the
candidates
in
the
campaign.
our
position
is
that
the
--
we're
trying
to
--
as
we
--
well,
everybody
in
the
case
says
that
they
represent
the
people
of
georgia.
of
course,
the
attorney
general
does
and
they
do
and
we
do
and
we
do
have
a
different
standing
on
what
that
requires
that's
what
i
gather
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
i
certainly
do.
yes,
sir.
most
extraneously.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir,
very
much
so.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
have
a
different
statute.
we
have
34-1514
as
the
runoff
statute.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
stand
by
34-1515
which
is
the
special
election
statute.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
there's
a
special
--
i
think
the
problem
in
georgia
--
this
is
as
a
practical
matter.
i
think
the
problem
in
georgia
with
the
respect
to
the
write-in
movement
in
the
--
this
is
the
first
time
this
has
happen
just
like
this
is
the
first
time
is
going
to
state
--
general
assembly.
and
the
problem
in
georgia
as
i
understand
it
was
the
people
felt
like
they
were
dealt
with
unfairly
in
the
electoral
process
and
they
move
forward
from
that
position
to
have
a
write-in
campaign.
in
a
special
election
in
georgia
under
the
georgia
statutes,
the
nominees
of
the
major
parties
would
appear
on
the
ballot
without
new
primaries.
others
could
qualify
to
run
for
governor
of
georgia
from
that
you
would
have
a
runoff
and
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
questions
as
to
the
un
--
what
some
voters
considered
unfairness
earlier
in
the
electoral
process.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
really
don't
because
i
think
it
will
be
over
with
and
it's
really
a
question
that
i'd
--
i
want
to
avoid
as
much
as
i
think
the
court
may
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
he
--
i
should
think
he
would.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
sir,
i
don't
find
a
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
that
would
tell
me
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional
unless
it
happens
to
be
that
as
mr.
justice
douglas
stated
in
his
opinion
in
gray
versus
sanders.
there
has
been
a
developing
thing
and
the
right
to
vote
in
this
country.
and
it's
a
--
the
right
to
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
think
that
this
court
has
had
a
more
--
has
had
an
expanding
view
of
the
right
of
suffrage
in
america.
and
i
think
that
that
expanding
with
this
certainly
shown
up
in
recent
years
in
the
case
of
baker
versus
carr,
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
beyond.
i
think
that
the
--
but
not
merely
this
court
but
other
branches
of
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
and
i
don't
say,
i
don't
find
a
specific
reference
to
that.
but
i
should
think
it
would
have
to
rely
upon
whatever
expanding
view
we
could
find.
we
find
that
in
congress
of
course
but
you
know
the
increase
of
(inaudible)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
certainly
do.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
it
--
it's
not
an
argument
i
intended
to
make
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that's
where
we
--
this
is
almost
what
we've
--
we
lead
to
as
we
moved
forward
either
that
or
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
didn't.
as
i
recall
it,
readmission
--
i'm
really
not
certain
of
this
but
it's
my
best
recollection
that
georgia
had
difficulty
gaining
readmission
in
the
congress.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i'm
really
not
sure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
must
have
been
in
the
constitution
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
georgia
was
readmitted
as
a
part
of
the
adoption,
was
it
not?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
it's
a
--
as
a
part
of
a
condition.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
now
here
we
go
back
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
reynolds
versus
sims.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
fine.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
a
judgment
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
i
did
not
think
could
foreclose
this
court
from
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we're
trying.
but
as
i
say
we
haven't
raise
this
question
here
as
much
as
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i've
--
i
really
find
myself
almost
being
forced
into
that
position
and
that
i'm
almost
into
it
i
want
to
get
out
of
it
and
i
don't
want
to
argue
that,
frankly.
now
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
come
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
to
take
it
that
way,
how
would
the
state
to
get
to
--
i'm
asking
myself
questions
as
i
go,
how
would
the
state
get
to
that
sort
of
a
system?
it
would
get
to
that
sort
of
system
by
its
state
constitution.
state
constitution
will
be
voted
upon
by
the
people.
i
should
think
that
this
would
be
the
declaration
of
the
right
to
vote
by
the
people
themselves
and
under
lucas
versus
colorado
it
might
be
forbidden
--
might
be
forbidden
under
the
lucas-colorado
case.
now,
we
know
that
federal
analogies
are
inapposite.
we
know
that
through
gray
v.sanders
and
reynolds
versus
sims.
we
come
to
this
court
asking
this
court
for
more
than
merely
a
ruling
on
what
the
lower
court
did
below
and
we
ask
it
for
guidance.
now,
we
understand
that
fully
that
this
court
does
not
render
advisory
opinions
but
it
does
render
opinions.
and
we
think
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
all
georgia
voters
and
in
the
interest
of
federal
judiciary
and
the
state
judicial
system
also
that
where
constitutional
questions
as
such
as
this
come
up.
that
whatever
the
opinion
the
court
renders
is
--
that
at
least
indicate
some
sort
of
rules
for
people
as
to
what
they
cannot
do
at
least.
in
light
of
that
we
want
to
refer
to
the
federal
analogy
of
the
state
constitutional
provisions
that
mr.
hill
referred
to
in
his
opening
argument.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
certainty
in
american
government.
there
is
certainly
a
certainty
with
respect
to
the
way
the
state
capital
appears.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
on
the
matter
that
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
on
case
of
controversy,
i
think
it
related
to
the
election
results
and
returns
from
the
fact
that
they're
opened
at
a
later
time
under
section
34-1506
(c)
of
the
georgia
election
code.
the
--
a
copy
of
those
returns
that
are
transmitted
to
the
secretary
of
state
are
retained
by
the
election
officials
themselves.
so,
an
exact
copy
can
be
obtained
of
what
the
--
those
returns
are.
under
section
34-403
of
the
georgia
election
code,
those
returns
are
subject
to
public
inspection.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
are
not
in
the
record,
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i've
said
judicial
knowledge
or
common
knowledge
that
there
was
not
a
majority
obtained
regardless
of
who
was
the
high
candidate.
now,
and
regarding
a
case
of
controversy
question
of
course
i
can
assure
the
court
there
is
a
controversy
going
on
in
georgia
and
that
the
stakes
are
rather
high.
the
problem
i
want
to
discuss
with
the
court
now
if
we
might
is
the
certainty
that
existed
in
the
georgia
constitution
before
the
district
court
ruling.
assuming
that
this
court
affirmed
that
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
remedy
to
be
affected
by
a
court
or
by
the
state
--
general
assembly
itself
or
by
a
state
court
either
by
this
court
or
the
district
court
below.
whoever
decides
how
the
governor
of
georgia
is
to
be
elected?
the
certainty
of
the
constitutional
provision
that
was
in
effect
has
a
great
deal
of
bearing
to
do
with
this
case.
now
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
surely,
i
know.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
did
not
the
raise
that
question.
i
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
don't
really.
ray
versus
blair
of
course,
again
it's
a
federal
analogy
question
going
into
the
electoral
college
question.
i
really
haven't
concede
that
this
oath
by
its
terms
other
than
one
of
a
moral
obligation
it
imposes
upon
the
person
who
takes
it.
that
this
oath
by
some
terms
does
extend
beyond
that
november
8th
general
election
and
i
do
believe
that
that
november
8th
general
election
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
and
for
the
--
other
purposes
is
over
now.
i
would
pretty
much
take
this
position
of
the
state
i
believe
on
that
especially
because
i'm
going
to
be
discussing
now
what
i
think
ought
to
happen
and
what
has
to
happen
because
there's
many
thorny
constitutional
questions
i
believe
in
the
way
you
finally
get
a
governor
of
georgia
as
are
initially
looking
forward
to
the
affirmance
of
the
court
decision
below.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
so
because
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir,
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
alright.
with
respect
to
the
entire
electoral
process
that
went
on
in
georgia,
it's
very
difficult
of
course
in
any
case
of
this
type
to
make
a
record
as
to
what
voters
intend
in
any
election
contest
case.
it's
always
difficult
to
say
that
a
certain
number
of
voters
would
have
voted
another
way
or
did
vote
another
way
because
that
sort
of
proceeding
is
always
open
to
perjury
as
to
what
people
say
their
intentions
were
and
what
they
were
going
to
do?
we've
tried
to
take
the
case
of
davis
versus
schnell
and
to
utilize
some
of
the
techniques
there
used
to
show
the
intention
of
the
legislature
and
the
electorate
regarding
this
general
election.
now
it's
our
contention
generally
that
the
election
was
held
under
the
provisions
of
the
georgia
constitution.
and
the
attorney
general
of
georgia
issued
an
attorney
general's
opinion
were
not
the
supporters
of
mr.
callaway
and
not
the
supporters
of
mr.
maddox
but
the
supporters
as
to
the
write-in
movement
went
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
said,
“look,
we
think
that
we
can
have
a
runoff
from
this
election
and
that's
what
we
want.”
and
at
that
point,
the
attorney
general
of
georgia
issued
an
official
opinion
saying
that
the
runoff
statute
did
not
jive
with
the
constitution
of
georgia
and
they
couldn't
have
a
runoff
election.
now
from
that
point
on,
there'd
became
a
great
misleading
of
the
electorate
of
georgia
and
that
misleading
was
not
a
venal
misleading.
it
wasn't
done
by
the
candidates
deliberately
or
the
press
deliberately,
by
the
attorney
general
georgia
deliberately,
it's
just
the
state
constitution
conflicted
with
the
state's
statute
his
interpretation.
he
said,
“state
constitution
would
prevail
and
this
election
would
go
to
the
state
legislature.”
now,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
that?
well,
i
think
its
common
knowledge
that
in
politics
you
often
have
the
argument
or
question
with
respect
to
the
lesser
of
two
evils.
this
candidate
is
the
less
of
--
lesser
in
two
evils
in
every
state
and
in
every
national
election.i'm
sure
that
argument
is
made.
but
in
thiselection
it
went
further
than
that.
it
was
commonly
argued
in
the
state
of
georgia
that
in
the
event
that
you
vote
for
a
write-in
candidate
whether
with
mr.
arnall
or
anybody
else,
you
thereby
contribute
to
the
election
of
mr.
maddox
because
when
you
do
that,
if
there's
no
majority,
it
will
go
the
general
assembly
and
there
mr.
maddox
will
get
a
second
chance
based
upon
the
oath
that
was
already
taken
in
the
democratic
predominance
in
the
general
assembly.
now,
this
had
an
effect
on
that
election
which
was
such
as
to
render
the
november
8th
proceeding
invalid
and
void
and
to
constitute
a
total
failure
of
election
because
--
due
to
the
misleading
that
election
could
not
be
a
proper
election
for
nominating
the
two
candidates
who
either
the
legislature
could
select
or
the
people
of
georgia
could
vote
on
at
a
later
time.
now
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
there
would
not
be
any
misleading
under
those
circumstances.
and
this
portion
of
the
argument
goes
only
to
the
--
based
on
the
assumptions
that
this
court
affirmed
the
district
court
below.
now,
the
influence
on
that
voter
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
no.
no
sir,
no
sir,
not
at
all.
i
don't
mean
to
(inaudible).
but
they
--
what
i
think
we
do
--
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
respect
to
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not,
the
principal
question
before
the
court
or
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
this
court
affirms
or
perhaps
overrules
or
overturns
or
remands
the
case,
you
know
for
other
proceedings.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
its
relevance
here
is
with
respect
to
what
opinion
this
court
might
write
as
to
the
kind
of
remedy
that
the
parties
below
might
receive
in
the
event
the
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
in
reynolds
versus
sims
the
ruling
of
this
court
made
alabama
hold
--
have
its
legislature
go
into
a
special
session
at
least
twice.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
sir
they
didn't.
and
i
think
reynolds
versus
sims
is
the
best
answer
to
the
political
thicket
question
i've
ever
seen
because
if
there's
ever
been
a
place
where
i
felt
like
we'd
have
trouble
with
that
decision
that
was
the
place
and
though
--
and
there
are
a
lot
of
television
commentaries
and
speeches
and
everything
else
but
by
(inaudible)
they
went
along.
and
after
they
passed
a
couple
of
laws,
the
district
court
below
in
the
--
what
then
became
sims
versus
baggett
ruled
and
we
got
a
properly
apportioned
state
legislature.
now,
and
i
think
that
the
same
thing
happens
here.
i
think
this
court
just
to
conjure
up
the
problems
that
may
confront
it
and
i
hate
to
do
that
but
i
-
to
the
gander
--
candor,
i
think
i
have
to.
to
conjure
up
the
problems
of
affirming
the
district
court,
these
are
the
kinds
of
problems
the
court
may
face.
first
of
all,
what
is
the
right
to
cast
a
write-in
the
ballot?
now,
most
of
the
cases
that
i
have
read
with
respect
to
this
right
arose
at
the
time
the
australian
ballot
was
being
adopted
in
this
country
or
seemed
to
have
risen
about
that
time.
and
this
right
to
cast
a
write-in
ballot
is
the
right
of
a
voter
to
reject
the
nominees
trust
upon
him
by
the
major
parties
or
by
any
other
nominating
process.
now,
repeatedly
throughout
the
history
of
this
country,
we've
had
recurrent
efforts
to
bar
minority
groups
in
the
ballot.
now,
we
have
laws
all
across
the
country
that
provides
certain
requirements
for
a
group
to
come
to
the
floor
to
get
on
the
ballot
via
percent
of
the
vote
in
the
last
election,
10%
whatever
it
may
be.
now,
the
right
to
vote
is
the
most
personal
right
a
man
has.
i
know
in
harper
versus
virginia
state
board
of
election
this
court
stated
that
it
didn't
reach
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
of
free
expression
and
then
went
ahead
to
decide
the
case.
well
in
this
instance,
we
obviously
have
voters
in
georgia
and
i'm
not
just
contending
there's
been
a
misleading
of
just
the
people
who
voted
for
the
write-in
thicket
or
just
the
ons
who
voted
for
the
callaway
thicket
or
just
the
ones
who
go
to
the
maddox
thicket.
i
think
it's
been
misleading
of
all
the
voters
in
georgia.
but
in
georgia,
we
had
some
voters
who
just
said,
“no.
one
time
in
our
lives
we're
not
going
to
say
the
lesser
of
two
evils.
we're
going
to
vote
who
we
want
to
vote
for
and
we're
going
to
do
it
by
very
cumbersome
procedure
and
we're
going
to
express
ourselves.”
and
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
sir,
as
i
understand
that
the
three
states
now
that
do
prevent
write-in
votes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
we're
taking
the
pos
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
we're
not.
our
co-appellees
in
--
the
co-appellees
just
--
just
are
taking
the
position
that
this
court
or
the
district
courts
below
should
bar
write-in
votes
in
a
runoff
election
between
the
two
men
who
ran
on
november
8th.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
a
state
election.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.and
the
state
attorney
general
has
taken
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
pretty
strong
medicine
for
me,
yes
sir.
and
the
state
attorney
general
has
taken
the
position
that
the
right
to
cast
write-in
ballots
is
a
constitutional
right
in
the
state
of
georgia
under
the
state
constitution.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
understand.
i'm
in
complete
agreement
that's
a
pretty
strong
thing.
now,
we
do
have
a
majority
of
the
american
states
of
course
which
have
a
plurality
system
and
you
can
see
and
conjure
ahead
a
conflict
between
the
minority
right
to
reject
and
the
majority
right
to
elect.
as
i
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
awhile
ago,
i
don't
think
that
this
problem
would
come
up
because
of
the
--
you
know
because
of
a
circumstances
below.
i
don't
think
we'd
have
another
write-in
movement
if
we
have
a
special
election.
i
think
we
do
have
a
great
problem.
if
a
court
of
the
united
states
or
really
any
other
governmental
agency
should
arrange
a
procedure
by
some
sort
of
ex
post
facto
process
of
nominating
who
the
people
can
vote
for
and
declining
to
allow
them
to
have
a
right
to
reject
those
nominees
and
vote.
alright,
i
know
the
status'
content
in
its
brief,
the
voters
in
this
--
in
georgia
were
not
misled.
somehow
they
were
to
be
clairvoyant
and
they
were
to
assume
that
the
state
constitutional
provision
would
be
thrown
out
and
that
their
own
attorney
general
was
wrong.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
point
well
made.
i
think
that
the
--
that
what
we
have
here
and
i
just
want
to
use
this
example
to
demonstrate
upon
my
--
the
kind
of
misleading
that
just
take
place.
dr.
benjamin
(inaudible)
in
georgia
is
a
man
perhaps
known
to
the
court.
he
president
of
morehouse
college,
then
there's
this
--
middle
of
the
1930s
as
president.
has
a
phd
degree
and
in
a
clipping
attached
in
our
brief
which
is
in
the
record
below.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
he
stated
on
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
in
the
atlanta
journal
of
october
11th,
“i
am
in
sympathy
with
the
statewide
grass
roots
campaign
to
elect
ellis
arnall.”
now
24
days
later,
november
4th
in
the
atlanta
daily
world
which
the
negro
daily
newspaper
with
the
circulation
of
30,500,
this
man
who
has
19
honorary
degrees
stated,
“after
much
searching
of
soul,
i
think
the
write-in
might
contribute
to
the
election
of
the
man
i
fear
would
set
our
state
back.”
if
mr.
arnall
pulled
a
heavy
vote
and
the
election
were
thrown
into
the
legislature,
mr.
maddox
would
be
governor.
this
is
a
hard
decision
to
make
but
i
make
it.
he
then
proceeded
to
endorse
mr.
callaway.
now
this
gentleman,
the
president
of
a
major
negro
educational
institution
is
a
plaintiff
in
the
justice
case.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
he
was
misled
and
if
a
man
with
a
phd
from
the
university
of
chicago
and
19
honorary
degrees
was
misled
then
what
of
the
135,000
voters
in
the
state
of
georgia
who
were
registered
to
vote
under
the
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
since
that
time.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
they
may
have
but
i
think
of
that
perticularly
is
that
they
all
usually
go
to
the
same
side.
i
want
to
conclude
now
by
saying
this
we
do
have
an
important
case
before
the
court
and
all
of
us
recognized
that.
this
is
the
case
in
which
we've
all
worked
rather
hard
during
the
last
few
weeks.
it's
a
case
which
this
court
has
moved
to
here
rapidly.
it's
a
case
in
which
the
attorney
general
of
georgia
wants
a
decision
immediately.
and
it's
a
cases
in
which
co-appellees
want
a
decision
immediately
and
it's
a
case
in
which
we
want
a
decision.
when
a
decision
can
be
reached
taking
into
consideration
the
constitutional
rights
of
all
the
parties
involved.
there
is
a
need
for
haste
in
the
case
but
not
for
undo
haste.
i
think
that
this
court
recognizes
that
there
are
complete
--
competing
and
conflicting
interest
here.
they're
really
vital
to
4
million
people
and
perhaps
to
people
in
other
states
even
though
almost
all
of
them
have
plurality
provisions
for
the
election
of
governor.
so
consequently
i
would
urged
the
court
that
there's
no
possibility
of
a
breakdown
on
the
government
of
georgia.
now,
there's
no
anarchy
there.
there's
nobody
proposing
that
we
don't
--
that
the
government's
falling.
i
want
to
express
our
appreciation
for
the
rapidity
which
the
court
has
heard
the
case
and
also
for
the
courtesy
which
we
have
received
from
counsel
on
all
side
in
this
matter.
i
know
that
this
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
stated
that
and
i
thought
well
said
stated,
“we
are
cautioned
about
the
dangers
of
entering
into
political
thickets
and
mathematical
quagmires.”
our
answer
is
this,
“but
a
dial
of
constitutionally
protected
rights,
the
man's
judicial
protection,
our
oath
and
our
office
require
no
less
of
us.”
thank
you.
