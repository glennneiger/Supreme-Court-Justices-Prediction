i
assume
you
would
say
that
no
voter
swore
to
vote
for
the

one
of
the
high
men.
if
the
legislature
elected
rather
the
people
elected,
so
he
would
say
that
they
took
an
oath
to
support
the
nominee
of
the

not
to
vote
directly
but
that
it
did
not
apply

held

they

you
say
that
they

they
performed
thereafter,
responded
to

that's
over?

the

justice

black
does
georgia
do
that
to?
justice

black
your
position
is
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
compel
a
state
to
elect
its
governor
by
the
people?
justice
hugo

but
what's
wrong
with
the
state
of
georgia
if
it
wants
to
providing
that
to
elect
the
governor
they
require
two-thirds.
does
it
--
can
a

to
the

gives
us
a
right
because
we
think
that's
mischievous
to

justice

it's

(inaudible)
any

why
wouldn't
it

this
is

because
you
have

the
(inaudible)
justice

i
understood
your

did

it
precisely
as
an
alternative

of

that
this

not

does
that

if
we

the

against

oh,
do
you
--
you
would
say
that
that
has
to
be
decided.
that's
one
of
your
argument,
it's
an
alternative
ground
you
insisted
that
the
election
be
enjoined?
justice
hugo

black
that
the
legislature
is
malapportioned?

what
you
would

georgia
was
compelled

do
if
it
has
two

one
or
two

fails
to
get
a
majority
to
compel
to
keep
on

elections
--

--
for
the

justice
hugo
l.
black
exactly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
wanted
to
know
is
what
do
you
say
georgia
should
do?
if
it
holds
an
election,
goes
to
the
extents
of
a
statewide
election
failed
to
get
a
majority,
do
you
say
the
federal
constitution
bars
it
from
letting
the
legislature
elect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
would
it
have
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
holding
in
the
federal
constitution
regarding
georgia
to
elect
its
governor
by
the
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
do
you
find
any
sentence
or
words
in
gray,
in
the
gray
case
indicating
that
its
holding
that
georgia
is
compelled
to
elect
its
governors
by
the
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
certainly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
they
filter
their
vote
in
this
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
get
it
filtered
to
get
a
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
it'll
be
filtered
if
they
elect
by
the
legislature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
runoff
general
election,
of
course
they
don't
get
a
majority
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they'll
have
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
didn't
get
a
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
you'd
have
to
have
another,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
your
position,
the
constitution
of
georgia
still
contained
the
exact
provisions
1798
--
all
it
said
was
the
governor
should
be
elected
by
the
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
don't
think
we
could
change
their
constitution
because
the
developing
idea
that
goes
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
didn't
have
any
expanding
view
as
to
the
right
of
state
to
select
its
officials
or
agency
by
appointment
rather
than
by
election,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
our
decisions
under
the
first,
fourth,
fifth,
sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth
amendments
certainly
represented
expanding
view?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
congress
did
--
does
it
readmit
georgia,
did
it
not
with
considerable
discretion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
the
validity
of
the
constitution
which
is
presented
and
accepted
it
as
its
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
argument
that
the
court
should
suppose
that
you
have
any
--
dig
up
all
the
campaign
arguments
that
were
made,
you
can
hold
the
law
unconstitutional
on
account
of
something
--
somebody
have
seen
it,
an
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
its
relevance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
think
that
we
could
make
georgia
spend
the
money
to
hold
another
statewide
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
they
decided
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
argue
it,
pointed
to
a
(inaudible)
holding
that
the
federal
constitution
bars
a
state
pass
an
election
law
to
prevent
write-in
obtained
in
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
yes
but
the
--
that's
the
state
jurisdiction.
--
are
you
pointing
out
that
the
fact
is
one
of
our
--
what
we
could
hold
if
we
affirm
it
is
that
they
can
prevent
or
not
prevent
write-in
votes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
state
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
the
state
wants
to
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
medicine,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
state
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
different
thing,
i
was
talking
about
the
federal.
justice
hugo

black
do
you
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
he
contended
the
voters
were
not
misled
in
the
general
statewide
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
they
had
more
common
sense
--
knowledge
about
the
election
than
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
--
and
the
notification
is
to
what
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
law
may
i
ask
you
is
not
in
effect,
is
it
if
the
old
provisions
of
the
constitution,
state
constitution
is
constitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
true
what
the
law
would
be
if
this
other
law
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
nothing
wrong
with
these
ages,
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
been
(inaudible)
the
constitutional
code,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
divide
as
in
--
indicates
there's
something
wrong.
you
don't
think
that
this
thing
has
been
in
the
constitution
for
142
years
was
put
there
in
order
to
constitute
a
device
by
the
people
of
georgia,
their
votes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
those
are
unrepresented?
what
do
you
mean
by
that
if
you
are
taking
up
the
argument
that
this
is
bad
because
the
state
legislature
is
malapportioned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
majority
of
states
have
a
provision
in
their
constitution,
do
they
not
that
in
case
of
a
tie,
selection
shall
be
by
the
legislative
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
claim
that
they
have
that
right
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
elect
–
to
provide
for
the
election
of
the
governor
by
the
legislative
body
if
it
wants
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
you
are
arguing
(inaudible)
or
for
anything
else.
that
is
this
section
5
is
constitutional.
georgia
still
--
georgia
law
still
authorize
the
election
by
the
people
under
all
circumstance
and
forbid
the
election
by
the
state
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
federal
constitution
forbids
the
election
of
a
governor
by
anything
but
the
people,
how
low
down
would
that
government
offices,
statewide
offices
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
(voice
overlap)
states,
they'd
audit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
important,
important
for
him
as
an
officer?
it
mean
that
we
forbid
under
the
federal
constitution
of
command
of
federal
law
that
a
state
shall
not
select
its
officer,
its
governor
by
a
legislative
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suggest
that
its
not
the
only
question?
i
would
suggest
the
question
whether
a
state
a
right
whether
the
federal
government
forbids
the
state
to
elect
its
governor
by
the
legislative
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
words,
if
the
constitution
has
changed
and
it
is
no
longer
that
law
of
the
constitution
if
the
states
and
the
people
of
states
have
all
the
powers
reserved
to
them
except
those
that
are
expressly
forbidden.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
we
meant
one
person,
one
vote
in
an
election
by
the
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
hasn't
gone
back,
it
hasn't
going
back?
it's
following
the
law
which
had
been
the
law
since
1824?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wouldn't
that
be
the
right
place
to
do
it
if
he
was
in
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
republican
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
a
republican
government?
you
said
that
and
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
your
idea.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
referred
to
it
as
the
--
to
give
you
a
republican
government.
now,
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
the
right
of
the
people
to
elect
their
governor,
that's
what
makes
it
a
republican
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
many
times
would
they
have
to
hold
separate
elections?
why
should
they
stop
with
–
just
with
the
top
two?
why
shouldn't
it
stop
to
--
first
have
one
head
problem
and
then
another
head
problem
and
another
problem
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
have
five
or
six
elections
--
justice
hugo

black
but
why
shouldn't
you
have
if
you
got
to
accommodate
everybody
who's
candidate
--
people
who
wanted
to
vote
for?
justice
hugo

black
even
though
it's
in
a
tie
and
can't
get
it
going?
justice

black
you
say
then
it
requires
at
least
two
shots,
you've
got
to
take
shots
for
the
–
before
they
could
–
that
the
sort
–
select
the

in
some

manner?
justice

black
that's
an
equal
protection
question,
one
man,
one
vote.
justice

black
whether
to
make
this
by

primary
election,
by
election,
a
vote?
justice
hugo

black
they
lost
them
when
they
failed
to
get
a
majority,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
they
don't
get
a
majority?
justice
hugo

black
what
you
are
saying
is
its
unconscionable
not
to
elect
the
governor?
justice
hugo

black
suppose
it
is,
if
–
does
this
court
had
power
to
fasten
its
judgment
on
the
people
of
georgia
to
add
to
the

a
provision
because
they
think
its
unconscionable
not

if
they're
going

there's

there?

it

i
assume

that
no

does

what's

you
abandoned
that
part
of
your
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
you've
abandon
that
part
of
your
compliant?
one
would
not
have
to
--
we
would
not
have
to
decide
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
we
decided
the
other
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
do
you
--
you
would
say
that
that
has
to
be
decided.
that's
one
of
your
argument,
it's
an
alternative
ground
you
insisted
that
the
election
be
enjoined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
legislature
is
malapportioned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
would
say
georgia
was
compelled
to
do
if
it
has
two
elections?
one
or
two
election
fails
to
get
a
majority
to
compel
to
keep
on
having
elections
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
exactly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
wanted
to
know
is
what
do
you
say
georgia
should
do?
if
it
holds
an
election,
goes
to
the
extents
of
a
statewide
election
failed
to
get
a
majority,
do
you
say
the
federal
constitution
bars
it
from
letting
the
legislature
elect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
would
it
have
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
holding
in
the
federal
constitution
regarding
georgia
to
elect
its
governor
by
the
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
do
you
find
any
sentence
or
words
in
gray,
in
the
gray
case
indicating
that
its
holding
that
georgia
is
compelled
to
elect
its
governors
by
the
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
certainly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
they
filter
their
vote
in
this
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
get
it
filtered
to
get
a
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
it'll
be
filtered
if
they
elect
by
the
legislature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
runoff
general
election,
of
course
they
don't
get
a
majority
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they'll
have
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
didn't
get
a
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
you'd
have
to
have
another,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
your
position,
the
constitution
of
georgia
still
contained
the
exact
provisions
1798
--
all
it
said
was
the
governor
should
be
elected
by
the
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
don't
think
we
could
change
their
constitution
because
the
developing
idea
that
goes
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
didn't
have
any
expanding
view
as
to
the
right
of
state
to
select
its
officials
or
agency
by
appointment
rather
than
by
election,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
our
decisions
under
the
first,
fourth,
fifth,
sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth
amendments
certainly
represented
expanding
view?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
congress
did
--
does
it
readmit
georgia,
did
it
not
with
considerable
discretion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
the
validity
of
the
constitution
which
is
presented
and
accepted
it
as
its
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
argument
that
the
court
should
suppose
that
you
have
any
--
dig
up
all
the
campaign
arguments
that
were
made,
you
can
hold
the
law
unconstitutional
on
account
of
something
--
somebody
have
seen
it,
an
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
its
relevance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
think
that
we
could
make
georgia
spend
the
money
to
hold
another
statewide
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
they
decided
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
argue
it,
pointed
to
a
(inaudible)
holding
that
the
federal
constitution
bars
a
state
pass
an
election
law
to
prevent
write-in
obtained
in
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
yes
but
the
--
that's
the
state
jurisdiction.
--
are
you
pointing
out
that
the
fact
is
one
of
our
--
what
we
could
hold
if
we
affirm
it
is
that
they
can
prevent
or
not
prevent
write-in
votes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
state
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
the
state
wants
to
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
medicine,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
state
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
different
thing,
i
was
talking
about
the
federal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
he
contended
the
voters
were
not
misled
in
the
general
statewide
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
they
had
more
common
sense
--
knowledge
about
the
election
than
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
--
and
the
notification
is
to
what
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
law
may
i
ask
you
is
not
in
effect,
is
it
if
the
old
provisions
of
the
constitution,
state
constitution
is
constitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
true
what
the
law
would
be
if
this
other
law
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
nothing
wrong
with
these
ages,
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
been
(inaudible)
the
constitutional
code,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
divide
as
in
--
indicates
there's
something
wrong.
you
don't
think
that
this
thing
has
been
in
the
constitution
for
142
years
was
put
there
in
order
to
constitute
a
device
by
the
people
of
georgia,
their
votes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
those
are
unrepresented?
what
do
you
mean
by
that
if
you
are
taking
up
the
argument
that
this
is
bad
because
the
state
legislature
is
malapportioned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
majority
of
states
have
a
provision
in
their
constitution,
do
they
not
that
in
case
of
a
tie,
selection
shall
be
by
the
legislative
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
claim
that
they
have
that
right
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
elect
–
to
provide
for
the
election
of
the
governor
by
the
legislative
body
if
it
wants
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
you
are
arguing
(inaudible)
or
for
anything
else.
that
is
this
section
5
is
constitutional.
georgia
still
--
georgia
law
still
authorize
the
election
by
the
people
under
all
circumstance
and
forbid
the
election
by
the
state
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
federal
constitution
forbids
the
election
of
a
governor
by
anything
but
the
people,
how
low
down
would
that
government
offices,
statewide
offices
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
(voice
overlap)
states,
they'd
audit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
important,
important
for
him
as
an
officer?
it
mean
that
we
forbid
under
the
federal
constitution
of
command
of
federal
law
that
a
state
shall
not
select
its
officer,
its
governor
by
a
legislative
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suggest
that
its
not
the
only
question?
i
would
suggest
the
question
whether
a
state
a
right
whether
the
federal
government
forbids
the
state
to
elect
its
governor
by
the
legislative
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
words,
if
the
constitution
has
changed
and
it
is
no
longer
that
law
of
the
constitution
if
the
states
and
the
people
of
states
have
all
the
powers
reserved
to
them
except
those
that
are
expressly
forbidden.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
we
meant
one
person,
one
vote
in
an
election
by
the
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
hasn't
gone
back,
it
hasn't
going
back?
it's
following
the
law
which
had
been
the
law
since
1824?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wouldn't
that
be
the
right
place
to
do
it
if
he
was
in
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
republican
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
a
republican
government?
you
said
that
and
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
your
idea.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
referred
to
it
as
the
--
to
give
you
a
republican
government.
now,
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
the
right
of
the
people
to
elect
their
governor,
that's
what
makes
it
a
republican
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
many
times
would
they
have
to
hold
separate
elections?
why
should
they
stop
with
–
just
with
the
top
two?
why
shouldn't
it
stop
to
--
first
have
one
head
problem
and
then
another
head
problem
and
another
problem
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
have
five
or
six
elections
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
shouldn't
you
have
if
you
got
to
accommodate
everybody
who's
candidate
--
people
who
wanted
to
vote
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
it's
in
a
tie
and
can't
get
it
going?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
then
it
requires
at
least
two
shots,
you've
got
to
take
shots
for
the
–
before
they
could
–
that
the
sort
–
select
the
governor
in
some
other
manner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
an
equal
protection
question,
one
man,
one
vote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
to
make
this
by
a
primary
election,
by
election,
a
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
lost
them
when
they
failed
to
get
a
majority,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
they
don't
get
a
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
is
its
unconscionable
not
to
elect
the
governor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
is,
if
–
does
this
court
had
power
to
fasten
its
judgment
on
the
people
of
georgia
to
add
to
the
constitution
a
provision
because
they
think
its
unconscionable
not
to
elect
the
governor,
if
they're
going
to
hold
this
law
in
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
nothing
wrong
with
this
age,
is
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
have
the
same
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we've
had
the
same
federal
concepts
and
you
were
here
under
federal
laws.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
since
1868
or
whatever
that
is,
the
adoption.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
they
amended
the
federal
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
people
amended
and
not
this
court?
and
--
justice
hugo

black
baker
versus

rely
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the

as
between

discrimination
between
