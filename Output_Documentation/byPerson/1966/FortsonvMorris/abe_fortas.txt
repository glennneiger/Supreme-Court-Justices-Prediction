justice

suppose
a
state
provided
in
its
constitution
that
the
man
who
comes
in

i
mean
the
governor,
the

race
will
be

that

or
is
there
something
in

that
in
the

make
that
appear

be
kind

awkward?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
you
really
come
down
to
here
was
clearly
a
--
do
you
say
that
the
state
constitution
may
provide
that
the
results
of
the
election
are
in
fact
washed
out
--
justice

--
if
neither
candidate
gets
a
majority
and
then
the
legislature
really
without
reference
to
the
results
of
the

except
in

as
if
the
election
were
a
nominating
convention,
the
legislature
can
then
choose
between
them.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
say
it.
as
if
i
that
were
a
nominating
convention
and
served
up
these
two
names
to
the
legislature
and
then
the
legislature
has
complete
freedom
to
select
the
man
who
came
in
first
and
then
came
in
the
second.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
about
the
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
when
georgia
became
a
member
of
a
union,
what
was
the
provision
for
electing
a
governor?
justice
abe
fortas
will
you
make
any
difference
in
theory
of
this
case
as
you
view
it
if
the
georgia
constitution
had
provided
and
in
a
situation
where
neither
candidate
gets
a
majority?
the
legislature
shall
select
the
governor
but
the
legislature
shall
vote
on
the
basis
of
one
vote
per
county
and
you
see,
you'd
have
the
county
unit
system
transferred
to
the
legislature?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
think
you
could
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
that
that
same
case
that
you're
now
arguing
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry,
--
i
have
a
(inaudible)
book
by
albert
perry
cite
the
constitution
on
the
history
of
georgia,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
reliable
book
or
not,
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
but
i'd
tell
you
that
georgia
was
the
fourth
state
in
the
nation
to
ratify
the
constitution.
it
ratified
it
in
1788
and
at
that
time
i'm
--
according
to
this
book,
the
--
nothing
of
the
electing
of
the
government
was
that
the
house,
lower
house
submitted
a
list
of
three
names
to
the
senate
and
the
senate
was
to
choose
the
governor
from
that
list.
do
you
have
any
information
on
this?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
that
one
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
questions
that
may
or
may
not
be
relevant,
i
suppose
that
the
georgia
constitution
contain
that
system
today
and
suppose
if
that
were
challenged,
what
would
be
the
impact
if
any
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
on
the
validity
of
that
system?
justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
do
you
remember
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
was
it
after
1824?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
come
across
any
explanation
as
to
why
1824
amendment
says
that
the
general
assembly
has
to
elect
the
governor
viva
voce?
justice
abe
fortas
if
there's
any
particular
reason
to
become
--
as
justifying
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well
what
if
he
can't
make
up
his
mind?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
difference
in
theory
between
this
system
that
you're
defending
in
the
county
unit
system?
suppose
that
the
constitution
in
georgia
provided
in
any
event
that
the
voters
did
not
cast
the
majority
of
the
votes
for
statewide
office
for
a
particular
candidate?
then
the
winner
will
be
selected
on
the
basis
of
a
county
unit
vote
tabulated
in
the
form
of
county
units,
is
it
your
contention
that
that
would
be
valid?
or
then
it
would
be
under
the
federal
constitution
invalid?
what
is
it,
that
they
submit
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
you
counted
alright,
let's
take
that
then.
let's
take
a
variant
of
it.
let's
suppose
you
counted
the
votes
of
the
georgia
legislature,
waited
on
the
county
basis
which
would
be
possible
as
practical
matter.
then
were
to
say
voters
don't
cast
the
majority
votes
for
any
particular
candidate
that
then
goes
to
the
legislature.
the
legislators
vote
as
between
the
top
two
candidates.
the
vote
of
the
legislators
is
counted
on
a
county
unit
system
and
waited
in
the
accordance
with
the
old
georgia
system.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
logic
of
it
that
gray
against
sanders
would
apply.
now,
the
only
difference
here
is
that
you
have
a
legislature
which
is
voting
on
a
one
legislator,
one
vote
basis,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
only
difference.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
constitution
provides
that
the
governor
in
these
circumstances
would
--
can
be
selected
from
the
top
two
candidates
on
the
basis
of
a
majority
of
the
legislators
present
in
voting,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
you
can
have
that
number
of
the
person
in
voting
as
to
constitute
a
forum
which
i
assume
is
a
majority.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
could
have
a
majority
of
a
majority.
the
legislators
which
were
--
could
certainly
be
a
minority
of
the
population,
in
fact
even
a
majority
an
absolute
majority.
the
legislators
could
represent
a
minority
and
of
the
population
on
the
voters
of
your
state.
justice
abe
fortas
and
particularly
isn't
that
true
in
view
of
what
is
a
present
malapportionment
of
a
legislator
--
of
a
legislature.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
legislature
is
acting
here
in
any
capacity
other
than
as
a
legislature,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
legislature
here
is
exercising
delegated
--
their
powers
on
the
basis
of
a
collegium
or
something
like
that?
justice
abe
fortas
its
acting
as
the
representatives
of
the
people
of
the
state,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
when
you
view
the
legislature
is
acting
in
that
capacity
perhaps
their
answer
to
me
is
correct
and
you
do
run
into
the
gray
against
sanders
problem.
at
least
in
a
hypothetical
situations
when
i
put
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
state
provided
in
its
constitution
that
the
man
who
comes
in
second,
i
mean
the
governor,
the
governor's
race
will

with
the
--
do
you
