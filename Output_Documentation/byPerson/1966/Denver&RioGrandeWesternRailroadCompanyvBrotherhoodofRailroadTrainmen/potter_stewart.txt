justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
where
--
would
not
--
how
that
follow
if
under
(b)
it
has
to
be
brought
where
all
the
defendants
reside.
certainly,
all
the
defendants
don't
reside
either
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio.
and
if
they
do,
then
none
of
them
--
my
hypothesis,
reside
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
potter
stewart
now
how
could
it
be
brought
in
either
place?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
surely
does
--
violence
to
the
statute
which
could
be
argued
to
be
equally
great
as
what
you
say
you're
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
certainly
under
their
reasoning
of
bouligny,
if
that
is
controlling
here
then
i
should
think
it
follows,
doesn't
it,
with
this
suit,
it
couldn't
be
brought
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
