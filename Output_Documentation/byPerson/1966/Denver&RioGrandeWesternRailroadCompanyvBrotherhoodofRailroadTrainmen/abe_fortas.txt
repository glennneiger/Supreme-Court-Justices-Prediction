bouligny
involved
of
the
diversity
of
citizenship
problem?
justice
abe

the
problem
on
--
in
bouligny
was
whether
for
purposes
of
determining
citizenship
which
has
the
constitutional
basis
in
the
diversity
doctrine,
it
would
take
the
position
that
a
labor
union
is
a
citizen
of
the
state
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
here,
you
have
a
question
of
residence,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
without
a
constitutional
basis
and
the
question
that
i
suppose
this
case
presents
is
whether
for
venue
purposes,
a
residence
of
a
labor
union
may
be
taken
to
be
where
it
has
put
principal
place
of
business,
that
would
be
cleveland
here.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
if
you
don't
take
that
position,
if
you
do
follow
the
analogy
of
bouligny
all
the
way
through
then
you
would
say
that
venue
would
be
proper
wherever
any
member
of
the
labor
union
can
be
found
because
the
historic
doctrine
is
that
labor
union
citizenship
is
a
citizenship
of
its
members,
of
each
of
its
members.

all
of

this
purpose
means
that
you
have
to
get
all
of

the
labor

you
assume
that
you
could
sue
the
labor

that
you
had
venue
over

you
