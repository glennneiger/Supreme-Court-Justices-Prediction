mr.
martin
m.
lucente
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
the
denver
&
rio
grande
western.
the
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
central
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
labor
union
may
be
sued
for
losses
resulting
from
an
unlawful
strike.
in
judicial
district
in
which
the
strike
occurred
in
which
the
employees
which
it
represents
work
and
reside
and
which
it
acts
for
those
employees
whether
the
action
may
be
brought
only
in
another
remote
judicial
district
where
the
union
maintained
its
headquarters.
this
action
was
brought
by
the
rio
grande
against
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
to
recover
damages
resulting
from
a
strike.
the
rio
grande
operates
a
railroad
system
extending
from
denver
colorado
to
salt
lake
and
ogden,
utah.
its
principal
place
of
business
is
in
denver
and
63%
of
its
line
of
road
is
situated
in
colorado.
the
brotherhood,
a
non-incorporated
association
holds
representation
rights
and
most
of
the
railroads
in
the
united
states
and
it
is
the
designated
representative
of
trainmen
employed
by
the
rio
grande.
the
brotherhood
consist
of
a
grand
lodge
which
is
located
at
cleveland,
ohio
and
local
lodges
which
are
situated
on
the
lines
of
each
of
the
railroads
in
which
it
represents
employees.
on
each
railroad
a
general
grievance
committee
elected
by
the
local
lodges
performs
the
brotherhood's
representation
functions
under
the
railway
labor
act.
on
the
rio
grande,
respondent
carroll,
with
headquarters
at
denver
was
chairman
of
the
grievance
committee
at
the
time
that
the
strike
occurred
and
at
the
time
of
the
proceedings
in
the
lower
court.
the
dispute
which
culminated
in
the
strike
involved
claims
of
contract
violation
which
the
brotherhood
had
submitted
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
on
behalf
of
the
rio
grande
employees
which
the
brotherhood
represented.
the
board
sustained
the
claims
and
it
awarded
a
full
days
pay
for
each
claimant
for
each
occasion
in
which
it
found
a
violation
of
the
contract
despite
the
fact
that
the
claimants
had
suffered
no
monetary
losses.
the
rio
grande
declined
to
make
what
it
regarded
as
the
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
payments
required
by
the
awards.
and
in
such
circumstances,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
enforcement
actions
are
provided
for
which
in
effect
test
the
validity
of
the
award.
the
brotherhood
however,
instead
of
filing
an
enforcement
action
undertook
to
compel
the
rio
grande
to
make
the
payments
required
by
the
awards
by
calling
a
strike.
the
strike
lasted
for
approximately
eight
hours.
it
was
enjoined
by
the
district
court
and
subsequently
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
held
that
the
strike
was
in
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
was
unlawful.
this
action
was
subsequently
brought
to
recover
damages
accruing
from
diversions
of
freight
to
other
railroads
as
a
result
of
the
unlawful
strike.
the
complaints
alleged
that
the
defendants
were
residents
of
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
and
that
the
venue
requirements
of
section
1391
of
the
judicial
code
had
thus
been
satisfied.
before
trial,
the
brotherhood
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
among
others
that
venue
was
improper.
this
motion
was
denied
by
the
district
court
which
subsequently
rendered
a
judgment
for
the
petitioner.
on
appeal,
the
court
below
reversed,
holding
that
venue
did
not
lie
against
the
brotherhood
in
colorado
but
was
proper
only
at
cleveland,
ohio
where
the
brotherhood
maintains
its
headquarters.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
respondent
carroll
is
not
responsible
for
the
strike
and
should
have
been
dismissed.
as
i
shall
develop
in
the
argument,
this
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
tenth
circuit
as
directly
in
conflict
with
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
so-called
rutland
case
and
it
is
also
in
conflict
with
basic
venue
principles.
the
venue
issue,
which
is
dominant
and
controlling
here
involves
section
1391
of
title
xxviii,
which
provides
in
part
that
non-diversity
actions
may
be
brought
only
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
all
defendants
reside.
the
requirement
of
residence
imposed
by
this
1948
enactment
is
not
defined
insofar
as
unincorporated
associations
are
concerned.
and
in
this
respect,
congress
adhered
to
the
pattern
of
prior
legislation
because
the
statute
which
was
superseded
by
the
1948
enactment
was
also
silent
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
the
venue
requirement
which
it
imposed.
but
prior
to
1948,
the
venue
statute
provided
that
no
civil
suit
shall
be
brought
in
any
district
court
against
any
person
in
any
other
district
and
that
whereof
he
is
an
inhabitant.
the
absence
of
elaboration,
the
definition
of
inhabitants
was
necessarily
left
to
the
courts.
as
to
one
incorporated
associations,
the
governing
determination
was
made
by
judge
hand
in
sperry
products
versus
the
association
of
american
railroads.
in
sperry
products,
the
relevant
statute
provided
that
in
patent
infringement
actions,
venue
was
proper
in
the
district
in
which
the
defendant
was
an
inhabitant
or
in
which
the
defendant
had
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
maintain
the
regular
and
established
place
of
business.
judge
hand
approached
the
venue
problem
in
that
case
by
determining
first
that
unincorporated
associations
should
be
regarded
as
entities
for
venue
purposes
since
existing
law
regarded
them
as
entities
for
other
procedural
incidence
such
as
capacity
to
sue
and
to
be
sued.
turning
next
to
the
question
of
location
to
be
attributed
to
the
entity,
judge
hand
concluded
that
unincorporated
associations
should
be
considered
to
be
present
wherever
they
were
continuously
carrying
on
a
substantial
part
of
their
business
just
as
corporations
were
regarded
as
present
in
such
circumstance.
to
determine
the
inhabitants
of
unincorporated
associations,
judge
hand
continued
to
rely
on
the
status
of
corporations
and
thus
concluded
that
inhabitants
was
limited
to
a
single
district,
that
of
the
association's
principal
place
of
business.
the
sperry
case
does
establish
the
principle
that
for
venue
purposes
an
incorporated
associations
should
be
regarded
as
jural
entities
and
that
their
inhabitants,
the
term
synonymous
with
residence
in
the
present
section
1391
should
be
determined
by
analogy
to
the
corporate
entities
which
they
most
closely
resemble.
as
judge
hand
stated
the
matter,
it
is
really
the
only
practicable
test.
since
inhabitants
was
the
requirement
not
only
of
the
patent
infringement
statute
but
also
of
the
general
venue
statute
at
that
time,
sperry
products
continued
to
be
a
controlling
authority
with
respect
to
venue
questions
arising
as
to
an
incorporated
associations
under
the
general
venue
statute.
in
1948,
when
congress
revised
the
judicial
code,
venue
in
non-diversity
cases
was
stated
in
terms
of
residence
rather
than
inhabitants,
again,
without
elaboration
as
to
defendants
other
than
corporations.
section
1391
(c),
however,
did
define
corporate
residence
in
terms
of
the
judicial
districts
in
which
a
corporation
is
licensed
to
do
or
is
doing
business.
this
definition
of
corporate
residence
obviously
changed
the
frame
of
reference
for
application
of
this
very
principle.
reliance
on
the
corporate
analogy,
which
was
judge
hand's
basic
approach
in
sperry
would
after
1948
require
consideration
of
the
definition
of
residence
appearing
in
section
1301
(c).
but
this
1948
change
did
not
impair
the
sperry
principle
which
was
unquestioned
at
that
time
insofar
as
unincorporated
associations
are
concerned.
moreover,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1948
revision
does
not
indicate
any
purpose
to
a
negative
or
to
restrict
the
application
of
the
sperry
principle
or
to
impose
venue
requirements
for
unincorporated
associations
differing
from
those
which
would
result
from
proper
regard
to
that
judicial
authority.
professor
moore,
who
was
importantly
concerned
with
the
1948
revision,
has
stated
that
section
1391
was
intended
to
continue
and
to
build
on
a
trend
of
judicial
decisions
relating
to
venue.
as
to
unincorporated
association,
the
trend
of
judicial
decisions
was
unmistakably
chartered
by
sperry,
existing
that
judicial
authority
would
thus
clearly
require
an
analysis
and
treatment
of
residence
for
unincorporated
associations
insistent
with
that
applicable
to
corporations.
certainly,
the
decided
cases
under
the
1948
provisions
support
this
conclusion.
since
the
1948
revision
of
the
judicial
code,
many
cases
upheld
that
consistent
with
sperry
residents,
for
unincorporated
associations
must
be
defined
by
reference
to
the
corporate
analogy.
the
leading
authority,
as
i
have
stated,
is
the
rutland
case
where
the
brotherhood
in
this
case
and
other
railroad
unions
argued
that
venue
in
vermont
was
improper
since
they
were
doing
--
since
their
principal
headquarters
were
located
elsewhere.
in
a
holding
against
respondent,
the
other
defendant,
judge
waterman
in
the
rutland
case
held
that
the
provisions
of
the
1948
judicial
code
must
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
preexisting
law,
principally
sperry
products
and
has
thus
view
the
residents
requirement
of
section
1391
was
satisfied
by
showing
that
the
defendant
unions
were
doing
business
in
the
district
in
question.
as
judge
waterman
stated,
we
believe
this
accords
with
the
practical
requirement
of
litigation
involving
unincorporated
associations.
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
other
decisions
to
the
same
effect
and
these
decisions
has
been
analyzed
and
characterized
by
professor
moore
as
desirable
and
justified
under
the
1948
venue
provisions.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
obviously
in
conflict
with
these
decisions.
the
rutland
case
and
the
other
decisions
to
which
i
have
referred
also
effectuate
the
liberalizing
purpose
of
the
1948
amendments
to
the
venue
code.
this
court
in
pure
oil
company
versus
suarez
emphasized
to
that
congressional
purpose
when
it
held
that
the
definition
of
residence
appearing
in
section
1391
(c)
should
be
read
into
the
venue
requirements
of
the
jones
act
which
had
theretofore
been
interpreted
to
limit
venue
to
a
corporation's
principal
place
of
business
or
state
of
incorporation.
this
court
emphasized
in
liberalizing
purpose
underlying
the
enactment
of
section
1391
and
held
that
in
the
absence
of
restrictive
indications,
this
purpose
should
be
implemented
by
judicial
updating
of
the
1920
venue
provisions
of
the
judicial
code.
there
is
also
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
1391
or
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
which
indicates
any
intent
to
restrict
the
principle
of
sperry
products
which
would
define
residence
for
unincorporated
association
by
reference
to
the
corporate
situation.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
also
contrary
to
basic
venue
principles,
which
clearly
establish
that
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
is
the
most
appropriate
form
for
this
particular
proceeding.
this
court
stated
these
basic
venue
principles
in
pure
oil
company
versus
suarez
where
it
noted
that
the
venue
provisions
of
section
1391
constituted
a
response
to
a
general
conviction;
that
it
was
intolerable
if
traditional
concepts
of
presence
and
residence
kept
the
corporation
from
being
sued
wherever
it
was
creating
liabilities.
in
the
earlier
case
of
neirbo
company
versus
bethlehem
corporation,
where
this
court
dealt
comprehensively
with
venue
questions,
the
underlying
basis
of
the
decision
was
that
venue,
though
defined
by
legislation
relates
to
the
convenience
of
litigants.
these
principles
are
fully
applicable
to
a
non-incorporated
association
carrying
on
multistate
business
activity.
colorado,
of
course,
is
the
place
where
the
denver
&
rio
grande
western
maintained
its
headquarters
where
it
conducts
a
majority
of
its
operations
and
where
it
handles
labor
problems
which
arise
and
which
involves
brotherhood
railroad
trainmen.
the
unlawful
strike
occurred
primarily
in
colorado
and
most
of
the
employees
participating
in
the
strike
work
and
reside
in
colorado.
furthermore,
the
entire
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
the
rio
grande
and
the
brotherhood
as
colorado
as
its
focal
point.
although
the
national
entity
is
the
certified
representative
of
trainmen
on
the
rio
grande,
it
is
a
party
to
the
basic
collective
bargaining
agreement
only
by
virtue
of
the
signature
of
the
general
chairman
whose
headquarters
are
maintained
in
denver,
colorado.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
national
entity
headquartered
in
cleveland
performs
its
functions
on
the
rio
grande
primarily
in
the
judicial
district
of
colorado.
the
brotherhood
consists
of
a
grand
lodge
at
cleveland
and
local
lodges
situated
on
each
railroad
including
the
rio
grande.
with
respect
to
grievances,
these
local
lodges
and
particularly
the
general
grievance
committee
are
invested
with
virtually
complete
authority
to
initiate
and
handle
claims
on
behalf
of
trainmen
including
ultimate
reference
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
the
general
grievance
committee
and
its
constituents
committees
are
also
giving
primary
jurisdiction
to
handle
disputes
which
arise
when
proposed
changes
in
the
agreements
are
under
consideration.
the
real
and
primary
authority
of
the
general
grievance
committee
headquartered
at
denver,
is
illustrated
by
general
rule
13
of
the
brotherhood
which
provide
that
whatever
action
may
be
taken
by
the
general
grievance
committee
shall
be
law
to
the
lodges
on
that
road
until
reversed
by
the
board
of
appeal.
although
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
headquartered
at
cleveland
does
exercise
supervisory
or
appellate
authority,
the
brotherhood's
activities
on
behalf
of
the
employees
of
an
individual
railroad
such
as
the
rio
grande,
take
place
in
the
geographical
area
where
the
railroad
operates.
even
in
the
case
of
strike
action
on
an
individual
railroad
joined
authority
by
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
and
the
general
grievance
committee
locally
headquartered
must
be
obtained.
the
president
may
authorize
the
strike
only
if
the
general
grievance
committee
joins
with
them
in
such
authorization.
these
circumstances
that,
i
submit,
make
it
highly
unreasonable
to
suggest
that
cleveland,
ohio
rather
than
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
is
the
proper
case
--
proper
forum
in
which
to
litigate
the
liability
of
the
brotherhood
in
this
case.
the
brotherhood's
business
are
representing
employees
on
the
rio
grande
although
based
on
certification
of
a
national
entity
is
conducted
by
the
brotherhood
in
colorado.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
in
deciding
that
cleveland,
ohio
was
the
proper
forum,
was
governed
entirely
by
its
interpretation
of
this
court's
opinion
in
steelworkers
versus
bouligny.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
attempt
any
statutory
interpretation.
it
did
not
in
fact
express
any
basic
disagreement
with
the
principle
of
the
rutland
case.
it
said
instead,
that
the
steelworkers
was
an
implicit
rejection
of
the
principle
of
the
rutland
case
and
that
venue
would
thus
be
proper
only
at
cleveland.
to
consider
the
application
of
steelworkers
to
the
venue
problem,
i
wish
to
emphasize
first
that
from
the
time
of
sperry
products
in
1942
until
this
case,
the
venue
of
unincorporated
associations
was
deemed
to
defend
on
two
largely
unchallenged
premises.
one,
that
for
venue
purposes,
such
associations
should
be
regarded
as
entities
having
a
residence
in
their
own
right.
and
two,
that
the
residence
should
be
determined
not
by
a
new
test
fashion
for
unincorporated
associations
but
by
analogy
to
corporations
which
such
associations
tend
to
resemble.
the
decision
below
by
intruding
the
rule
of
steelworkers,
a
diversity
jurisdiction
case,
into
the
law
of
venue,
strikes
at
this
settled
fundamentals
of
venue
law.
steelworkers
had
nothing
to
do
with
venue
and
this
court
said
nothing
in
its
opinion
about
venue
problem.
rather,
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
a
non-incorporated
labor
union
is
to
be
treated
as
a
citizen
for
purposes
of
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
without
regard
to
the
citizenship
of
its
members.
the
lower
court,
following
the
rule
which
have
been
recognized
since
1889
had
held
that
for
diversity
purposes,
a
non-incorporated
association
is
an
aggregation
of
individuals
and
thus
has
the
citizenship
of
each
of
its
members.
this
court
affirmed,
stressing
the
fact
that
if
unincorporated
associations
were
to
be
treated
as
entities
for
diversity
purposes,
that
considerable
expansion
in
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
would
result.
there's
nothing
in
this
holding
which
has
any
relevance
to
venue.
to
hold
that
a
non-incorporated
association
is
an
aggregation
of
individuals
for
a
diversity
of
jurisdiction
purposes
is
to
avoid
changing
established
principles
applicable
to
federal
jurisdiction.
on
the
other
hand,
to
hold
that
a
non-incorporated
association
is
an
aggregation
of
individuals
for
venue
purposes
would
be
to
overturn
entirely
venue
doctrine
that
has
been
accepted
for
the
last
25
years.
there
is
no
reason
why
different
rules
should
not
exist
in
these
two
different
areas
of
the
law.
the
rules
differ
because
the
considerations
which
underlie
them
differed.
as
this
court
has
held,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
their
power
to
adjudicate
is
a
grant
of
authority
to
them
by
congress
but
the
locality
of
the
lawsuit,
the
place
where
judicial
authority
may
be
exercised
though
defined
by
legislation,
relates
to
the
convenience
of
the
litigants.
thus,
for
example,
jurisdiction
is
beyond
the
scope
of
litigants
to
confer
that
venue
is
subject
to
their
disposition.
the
inapplicability
of
steelworkers
to
the
determination
of
the
venue
problems
presented
by
this
case
is
perhaps
most
clearly
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
although
the
lower
court
purported
to
rely
on
steelworkers,
it
failed
to
apply
the
principle
of
steelworkers
in
reaching
the
result
which
it
reached
in
this
case.
under
steelworkers,
a
non-incorporated
association
being
considered
an
aggregation
of
individuals,
with
each
of
the
associations
would
have
the
aggregate
residents
of
all
of
its
members
for
venue
purpose.
in
no
situation
in
which
a
non-incorporated
association
has
members
in
more
than
one
state,
could
it
be
said
that
all
of
the
defendants
reside
within
one
judicial
district
because
all
of
the
defendants,
being
all
of
the
members
of
the
association,
would
have
residence
spelling
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
a
particular
district.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
the
result
indicated
by
the
principle
of
this
steelworkers
case.
instead,
it
held
that
venue
was
proper
at
cleveland,
ohio
and
thus
abandoning
entirely
the
principle
of
steelworkers
that
a
non-incorporated
association
is
an
aggregation
of
individuals.
for
these
reasons,
that
we
most
respectfully
suggest
that
the
decision
in
steelworkers
was
misinterpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
is
the
proper
forum
and
that
the
lower
court's
decision
should
be
reversed.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
short
response
to
the
question
of
the
recent
amendment
to
the
venue
statute,
it
is
true
that
mr.
highsaw
stated
that
the
venue
statute
was
amended
in
november
of
1966
to
provide
and
in
addition
to
venue
where
all
defendants
reside,
actions,
a
non-diversity
and
diversity
actions
alike,
may
also
be
brought
where
the
claim
arises.
now,
that
--
it
--
amendment
to
the
venue
statute
does
not
resolve
the
question
presented
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
that
is,
where
does
an
unincorporated
association
reside
for
venue
purposes?
there
is
still
an
important
and
very
substantial
interest
in
the
question
of
residence
as
distinguished
from
the
question
raised
by
the
amendment
where
the
claim
arises.
and
we
accordingly
urge
that
our
position
with
respect
to
residence
of
unincorporated
association
is
right,
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
it
should
be
reversed.
if
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
brotherhood
is
not
a
residence
of
that
judicial
district
of
colorado,
then
it
may
become
a
question
to
be
considered
by
the
lower
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
claim
arose
under
--
in
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
under
the
recent
amendment.
but
we
still
urged
upon
your
honors
that
the
question
of
residence
remained
a
paramount
one
and
one
that
is
still
alive
very
much.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
the
denver
&
rio
grande
western.
the
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
central
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
labor
union
may
be
sued
for
losses
resulting
from
an
unlawful
strike.
in
judicial
district
in
which
the
strike
occurred
in
which
the
employees
which
it
represents
work
and
reside
and
which
it
acts
for
those
employees
whether
the
action
may
be
brought
only
in
another
remote
judicial
district
where
the
union
maintained
its
headquarters.
this
action
was
brought
by
the
rio
grande
against
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
to
recover
damages
resulting
from
a
strike.
the
rio
grande
operates
a
railroad
system
extending
from
denver
colorado
to
salt
lake
and
ogden,
utah.
its
principal
place
of
business
is
in
denver
and
63%
of
its
line
of
road
is
situated
in
colorado.
the
brotherhood,
a
non-incorporated
association
holds
representation
rights
and
most
of
the
railroads
in
the
united
states
and
it
is
the
designated
representative
of
trainmen
employed
by
the
rio
grande.
the
brotherhood
consist
of
a
grand
lodge
which
is
located
at
cleveland,
ohio
and
local
lodges
which
are
situated
on
the
lines
of
each
of
the
railroads
in
which
it
represents
employees.
on
each
railroad
a
general
grievance
committee
elected
by
the
local
lodges
performs
the
brotherhood's
representation
functions
under
the
railway
labor
act.
on
the
rio
grande,
respondent
carroll,
with
headquarters
at
denver
was
chairman
of
the
grievance
committee
at
the
time
that
the
strike
occurred
and
at
the
time
of
the
proceedings
in
the
lower
court.
the
dispute
which
culminated
in
the
strike
involved
claims
of
contract
violation
which
the
brotherhood
had
submitted
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
on
behalf
of
the
rio
grande
employees
which
the
brotherhood
represented.
the
board
sustained
the
claims
and
it
awarded
a
full
days
pay
for
each
claimant
for
each
occasion
in
which
it
found
a
violation
of
the
contract
despite
the
fact
that
the
claimants
had
suffered
no
monetary
losses.
the
rio
grande
declined
to
make
what
it
regarded
as
the
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
payments
required
by
the
awards.
and
in
such
circumstances,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
enforcement
actions
are
provided
for
which
in
effect
test
the
validity
of
the
award.
the
brotherhood
however,
instead
of
filing
an
enforcement
action
undertook
to
compel
the
rio
grande
to
make
the
payments
required
by
the
awards
by
calling
a
strike.
the
strike
lasted
for
approximately
eight
hours.
it
was
enjoined
by
the
district
court
and
subsequently
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
held
that
the
strike
was
in
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
was
unlawful.
this
action
was
subsequently
brought
to
recover
damages
accruing
from
diversions
of
freight
to
other
railroads
as
a
result
of
the
unlawful
strike.
the
complaints
alleged
that
the
defendants
were
residents
of
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
and
that
the
venue
requirements
of
section
1391
of
the
judicial
code
had
thus
been
satisfied.
before
trial,
the
brotherhood
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
among
others
that
venue
was
improper.
this
motion
was
denied
by
the
district
court
which
subsequently
rendered
a
judgment
for
the
petitioner.
on
appeal,
the
court
below
reversed,
holding
that
venue
did
not
lie
against
the
brotherhood
in
colorado
but
was
proper
only
at
cleveland,
ohio
where
the
brotherhood
maintains
its
headquarters.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
respondent
carroll
is
not
responsible
for
the
strike
and
should
have
been
dismissed.
as
i
shall
develop
in
the
argument,
this
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
tenth
circuit
as
directly
in
conflict
with
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
so-called
rutland
case
and
it
is
also
in
conflict
with
basic
venue
principles.
the
venue
issue,
which
is
dominant
and
controlling
here
involves
section
1391
of
title
xxviii,
which
provides
in
part
that
non-diversity
actions
may
be
brought
only
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
all
defendants
reside.
the
requirement
of
residence
imposed
by
this
1948
enactment
is
not
defined
insofar
as
unincorporated
associations
are
concerned.
and
in
this
respect,
congress
adhered
to
the
pattern
of
prior
legislation
because
the
statute
which
was
superseded
by
the
1948
enactment
was
also
silent
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
the
venue
requirement
which
it
imposed.
but
prior
to
1948,
the
venue
statute
provided
that
no
civil
suit
shall
be
brought
in
any
district
court
against
any
person
in
any
other
district
and
that
whereof
he
is
an
inhabitant.
the
absence
of
elaboration,
the
definition
of
inhabitants
was
necessarily
left
to
the
courts.
as
to
one
incorporated
associations,
the
governing
determination
was
made
by
judge
hand
in
sperry
products
versus
the
association
of
american
railroads.
in
sperry
products,
the
relevant
statute
provided
that
in
patent
infringement
actions,
venue
was
proper
in
the
district
in
which
the
defendant
was
an
inhabitant
or
in
which
the
defendant
had
committed
acts
of
infringement
and
maintain
the
regular
and
established
place
of
business.
judge
hand
approached
the
venue
problem
in
that
case
by
determining
first
that
unincorporated
associations
should
be
regarded
as
entities
for
venue
purposes
since
existing
law
regarded
them
as
entities
for
other
procedural
incidence
such
as
capacity
to
sue
and
to
be
sued.
turning
next
to
the
question
of
location
to
be
attributed
to
the
entity,
judge
hand
concluded
that
unincorporated
associations
should
be
considered
to
be
present
wherever
they
were
continuously
carrying
on
a
substantial
part
of
their
business
just
as
corporations
were
regarded
as
present
in
such
circumstance.
to
determine
the
inhabitants
of
unincorporated
associations,
judge
hand
continued
to
rely
on
the
status
of
corporations
and
thus
concluded
that
inhabitants
was
limited
to
a
single
district,
that
of
the
association's
principal
place
of
business.
the
sperry
case
does
establish
the
principle
that
for
venue
purposes
an
incorporated
associations
should
be
regarded
as
jural
entities
and
that
their
inhabitants,
the
term
synonymous
with
residence
in
the
present
section
1391
should
be
determined
by
analogy
to
the
corporate
entities
which
they
most
closely
resemble.
as
judge
hand
stated
the
matter,
it
is
really
the
only
practicable
test.
since
inhabitants
was
the
requirement
not
only
of
the
patent
infringement
statute
but
also
of
the
general
venue
statute
at
that
time,
sperry
products
continued
to
be
a
controlling
authority
with
respect
to
venue
questions
arising
as
to
an
incorporated
associations
under
the
general
venue
statute.
in
1948,
when
congress
revised
the
judicial
code,
venue
in
non-diversity
cases
was
stated
in
terms
of
residence
rather
than
inhabitants,
again,
without
elaboration
as
to
defendants
other
than
corporations.
section
1391
(c),
however,
did
define
corporate
residence
in
terms
of
the
judicial
districts
in
which
a
corporation
is
licensed
to
do
or
is
doing
business.
this
definition
of
corporate
residence
obviously
changed
the
frame
of
reference
for
application
of
this
very
principle.
reliance
on
the
corporate
analogy,
which
was
judge
hand's
basic
approach
in
sperry
would
after
1948
require
consideration
of
the
definition
of
residence
appearing
in
section
1301
(c).
but
this
1948
change
did
not
impair
the
sperry
principle
which
was
unquestioned
at
that
time
insofar
as
unincorporated
associations
are
concerned.
moreover,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1948
revision
does
not
indicate
any
purpose
to
a
negative
or
to
restrict
the
application
of
the
sperry
principle
or
to
impose
venue
requirements
for
unincorporated
associations
differing
from
those
which
would
result
from
proper
regard
to
that
judicial
authority.
professor
moore,
who
was
importantly
concerned
with
the
1948
revision,
has
stated
that
section
1391
was
intended
to
continue
and
to
build
on
a
trend
of
judicial
decisions
relating
to
venue.
as
to
unincorporated
association,
the
trend
of
judicial
decisions
was
unmistakably
chartered
by
sperry,
existing
that
judicial
authority
would
thus
clearly
require
an
analysis
and
treatment
of
residence
for
unincorporated
associations
insistent
with
that
applicable
to
corporations.
certainly,
the
decided
cases
under
the
1948
provisions
support
this
conclusion.
since
the
1948
revision
of
the
judicial
code,
many
cases
upheld
that
consistent
with
sperry
residents,
for
unincorporated
associations
must
be
defined
by
reference
to
the
corporate
analogy.
the
leading
authority,
as
i
have
stated,
is
the
rutland
case
where
the
brotherhood
in
this
case
and
other
railroad
unions
argued
that
venue
in
vermont
was
improper
since
they
were
doing
--
since
their
principal
headquarters
were
located
elsewhere.
in
a
holding
against
respondent,
the
other
defendant,
judge
waterman
in
the
rutland
case
held
that
the
provisions
of
the
1948
judicial
code
must
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
preexisting
law,
principally
sperry
products
and
has
thus
view
the
residents
requirement
of
section
1391
was
satisfied
by
showing
that
the
defendant
unions
were
doing
business
in
the
district
in
question.
as
judge
waterman
stated,
we
believe
this
accords
with
the
practical
requirement
of
litigation
involving
unincorporated
associations.
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
other
decisions
to
the
same
effect
and
these
decisions
has
been
analyzed
and
characterized
by
professor
moore
as
desirable
and
justified
under
the
1948
venue
provisions.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
obviously
in
conflict
with
these
decisions.
the
rutland
case
and
the
other
decisions
to
which
i
have
referred
also
effectuate
the
liberalizing
purpose
of
the
1948
amendments
to
the
venue
code.
this
court
in
pure
oil
company
versus
suarez
emphasized
to
that
congressional
purpose
when
it
held
that
the
definition
of
residence
appearing
in
section
1391
(c)
should
be
read
into
the
venue
requirements
of
the
jones
act
which
had
theretofore
been
interpreted
to
limit
venue
to
a
corporation's
principal
place
of
business
or
state
of
incorporation.
this
court
emphasized
in
liberalizing
purpose
underlying
the
enactment
of
section
1391
and
held
that
in
the
absence
of
restrictive
indications,
this
purpose
should
be
implemented
by
judicial
updating
of
the
1920
venue
provisions
of
the
judicial
code.
there
is
also
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
1391
or
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
which
indicates
any
intent
to
restrict
the
principle
of
sperry
products
which
would
define
residence
for
unincorporated
association
by
reference
to
the
corporate
situation.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
also
contrary
to
basic
venue
principles,
which
clearly
establish
that
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
is
the
most
appropriate
form
for
this
particular
proceeding.
this
court
stated
these
basic
venue
principles
in
pure
oil
company
versus
suarez
where
it
noted
that
the
venue
provisions
of
section
1391
constituted
a
response
to
a
general
conviction;
that
it
was
intolerable
if
traditional
concepts
of
presence
and
residence
kept
the
corporation
from
being
sued
wherever
it
was
creating
liabilities.
in
the
earlier
case
of
neirbo
company
versus
bethlehem
corporation,
where
this
court
dealt
comprehensively
with
venue
questions,
the
underlying
basis
of
the
decision
was
that
venue,
though
defined
by
legislation
relates
to
the
convenience
of
litigants.
these
principles
are
fully
applicable
to
a
non-incorporated
association
carrying
on
multistate
business
activity.
colorado,
of
course,
is
the
place
where
the
denver
&
rio
grande
western
maintained
its
headquarters
where
it
conducts
a
majority
of
its
operations
and
where
it
handles
labor
problems
which
arise
and
which
involves
brotherhood
railroad
trainmen.
the
unlawful
strike
occurred
primarily
in
colorado
and
most
of
the
employees
participating
in
the
strike
work
and
reside
in
colorado.
furthermore,
the
entire
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
the
rio
grande
and
the
brotherhood
as
colorado
as
its
focal
point.
although
the
national
entity
is
the
certified
representative
of
trainmen
on
the
rio
grande,
it
is
a
party
to
the
basic
collective
bargaining
agreement
only
by
virtue
of
the
signature
of
the
general
chairman
whose
headquarters
are
maintained
in
denver,
colorado.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
national
entity
headquartered
in
cleveland
performs
its
functions
on
the
rio
grande
primarily
in
the
judicial
district
of
colorado.
the
brotherhood
consists
of
a
grand
lodge
at
cleveland
and
local
lodges
situated
on
each
railroad
including
the
rio
grande.
with
respect
to
grievances,
these
local
lodges
and
particularly
the
general
grievance
committee
are
invested
with
virtually
complete
authority
to
initiate
and
handle
claims
on
behalf
of
trainmen
including
ultimate
reference
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
the
general
grievance
committee
and
its
constituents
committees
are
also
giving
primary
jurisdiction
to
handle
disputes
which
arise
when
proposed
changes
in
the
agreements
are
under
consideration.
the
real
and
primary
authority
of
the
general
grievance
committee
headquartered
at
denver,
is
illustrated
by
general
rule
13
of
the
brotherhood
which
provide
that
whatever
action
may
be
taken
by
the
general
grievance
committee
shall
be
law
to
the
lodges
on
that
road
until
reversed
by
the
board
of
appeal.
although
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
headquartered
at
cleveland
does
exercise
supervisory
or
appellate
authority,
the
brotherhood's
activities
on
behalf
of
the
employees
of
an
individual
railroad
such
as
the
rio
grande,
take
place
in
the
geographical
area
where
the
railroad
operates.
even
in
the
case
of
strike
action
on
an
individual
railroad
joined
authority
by
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
and
the
general
grievance
committee
locally
headquartered
must
be
obtained.
the
president
may
authorize
the
strike
only
if
the
general
grievance
committee
joins
with
them
in
such
authorization.
these
circumstances
that,
i
submit,
make
it
highly
unreasonable
to
suggest
that
cleveland,
ohio
rather
than
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
is
the
proper
case
--
proper
forum
in
which
to
litigate
the
liability
of
the
brotherhood
in
this
case.
the
brotherhood's
business
are
representing
employees
on
the
rio
grande
although
based
on
certification
of
a
national
entity
is
conducted
by
the
brotherhood
in
colorado.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
in
deciding
that
cleveland,
ohio
was
the
proper
forum,
was
governed
entirely
by
its
interpretation
of
this
court's
opinion
in
steelworkers
versus
bouligny.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
attempt
any
statutory
interpretation.
it
did
not
in
fact
express
any
basic
disagreement
with
the
principle
of
the
rutland
case.
it
said
instead,
that
the
steelworkers
was
an
implicit
rejection
of
the
principle
of
the
rutland
case
and
that
venue
would
thus
be
proper
only
at
cleveland.
to
consider
the
application
of
steelworkers
to
the
venue
problem,
i
wish
to
emphasize
first
that
from
the
time
of
sperry
products
in
1942
until
this
case,
the
venue
of
unincorporated
associations
was
deemed
to
defend
on
two
largely
unchallenged
premises.
one,
that
for
venue
purposes,
such
associations
should
be
regarded
as
entities
having
a
residence
in
their
own
right.
and
two,
that
the
residence
should
be
determined
not
by
a
new
test
fashion
for
unincorporated
associations
but
by
analogy
to
corporations
which
such
associations
tend
to
resemble.
the
decision
below
by
intruding
the
rule
of
steelworkers,
a
diversity
jurisdiction
case,
into
the
law
of
venue,
strikes
at
this
settled
fundamentals
of
venue
law.
steelworkers
had
nothing
to
do
with
venue
and
this
court
said
nothing
in
its
opinion
about
venue
problem.
rather,
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
a
non-incorporated
labor
union
is
to
be
treated
as
a
citizen
for
purposes
of
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
without
regard
to
the
citizenship
of
its
members.
the
lower
court,
following
the
rule
which
have
been
recognized
since
1889
had
held
that
for
diversity
purposes,
a
non-incorporated
association
is
an
aggregation
of
individuals
and
thus
has
the
citizenship
of
each
of
its
members.
this
court
affirmed,
stressing
the
fact
that
if
unincorporated
associations
were
to
be
treated
as
entities
for
diversity
purposes,
that
considerable
expansion
in
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
would
result.
there's
nothing
in
this
holding
which
has
any
relevance
to
venue.
to
hold
that
a
non-incorporated
association
is
an
aggregation
of
individuals
for
a
diversity
of
jurisdiction
purposes
is
to
avoid
changing
established
principles
applicable
to
federal
jurisdiction.
on
the
other
hand,
to
hold
that
a
non-incorporated
association
is
an
aggregation
of
individuals
for
venue
purposes
would
be
to
overturn
entirely
venue
doctrine
that
has
been
accepted
for
the
last
25
years.
there
is
no
reason
why
different
rules
should
not
exist
in
these
two
different
areas
of
the
law.
the
rules
differ
because
the
considerations
which
underlie
them
differed.
as
this
court
has
held,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
their
power
to
adjudicate
is
a
grant
of
authority
to
them
by
congress
but
the
locality
of
the
lawsuit,
the
place
where
judicial
authority
may
be
exercised
though
defined
by
legislation,
relates
to
the
convenience
of
the
litigants.
thus,
for
example,
jurisdiction
is
beyond
the
scope
of
litigants
to
confer
that
venue
is
subject
to
their
disposition.
the
inapplicability
of
steelworkers
to
the
determination
of
the
venue
problems
presented
by
this
case
is
perhaps
most
clearly
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
although
the
lower
court
purported
to
rely
on
steelworkers,
it
failed
to
apply
the
principle
of
steelworkers
in
reaching
the
result
which
it
reached
in
this
case.
under
steelworkers,
a
non-incorporated
association
being
considered
an
aggregation
of
individuals,
with
each
of
the
associations
would
have
the
aggregate
residents
of
all
of
its
members
for
venue
purpose.
in
no
situation
in
which
a
non-incorporated
association
has
members
in
more
than
one
state,
could
it
be
said
that
all
of
the
defendants
reside
within
one
judicial
district
because
all
of
the
defendants,
being
all
of
the
members
of
the
association,
would
have
residence
spelling
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
a
particular
district.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
the
result
indicated
by
the
principle
of
this
steelworkers
case.
instead,
it
held
that
venue
was
proper
at
cleveland,
ohio
and
thus
abandoning
entirely
the
principle
of
steelworkers
that
a
non-incorporated
association
is
an
aggregation
of
individuals.
for
these
reasons,
that
we
most
respectfully
suggest
that
the
decision
in
steelworkers
was
misinterpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
is
the
proper
forum
and
that
the
lower
court's
decision
should
be
reversed.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
short
response
to
the
question
of
the
recent
amendment
to
the
venue
statute,
it
is
true
that
mr.
highsaw
stated
that
the
venue
statute
was
amended
in
november
of
1966
to
provide
and
in
addition
to
venue
where
all
defendants
reside,
actions,
a
non-diversity
and
diversity
actions
alike,
may
also
be
brought
where
the
claim
arises.
now,
that
--
it
--
amendment
to
the
venue
statute
does
not
resolve
the
question
presented
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
that
is,
where
does
an
unincorporated
association
reside
for
venue
purposes?
there
is
still
an
important
and
very
substantial
interest
in
the
question
of
residence
as
distinguished
from
the
question
raised
by
the
amendment
where
the
claim
arises.
and
we
accordingly
urge
that
our
position
with
respect
to
residence
of
unincorporated
association
is
right,
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
it
should
be
reversed.
if
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
brotherhood
is
not
a
residence
of
that
judicial
district
of
colorado,
then
it
may
become
a
question
to
be
considered
by
the
lower
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
claim
arose
under
--
in
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
under
the
recent
amendment.
but
we
still
urged
upon
your
honors
that
the
question
of
residence
remained
a
paramount
one
and
one
that
is
still
alive
very
much.
