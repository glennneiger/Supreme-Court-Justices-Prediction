mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
i
believe
at
the
outset
that
i
should
straighten
out
a
few
of
the
facts
that
have
been
stated
by
counsel.
most
of
the
facts
that
he
stated,
either
are
not
of
the
record
and
the
remainder
of
them,
i
don't'
believe
he
has
accurately
stated.
counsel
stated
that
the
strike
which
was
here
involved
grew
out
of
the
carrier's
refusal
to
accept
awards,
the
payment
of
money,
involving
payment
of
money.
however,
in
one
of
the
two
awards,
the
carrier
refused
to
put
into
effect
the
contract
--
interpretation
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
which
in
our
opinion
was
in
and
of
itself
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
also
at
the
time
of
the
strike
occurred,
it
was
some
two
years
later
that
this
court
finally
held
that
railroad
employees
were
prohibited
in
conducting
this
type
of
strike.
and
counsel
says
that
the
strike
occurred
mostly
in
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
but
most
of
the
railroad
employees
are
in
this
judicial
district.
the
record
contains
nothing
at
all
on
this.
the
strike
did
occur
in
colorado.
it
also
occurred
to
some
extent
in
utah.
how
much
--
how
many
employees
were
involved
in
colorado,
how
many
in
utah
is
not
of
record.
counsel
says
that
the
b.r.t.,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
acts,
it
carries
on
its
representation
that
both
covered
in
colorado,
for
its
members
in
colorado.
this
is
not
a
fact
of
record.
counsel
relies
upon
an
appendix
in
the
brief
with
respect
to
rules
and
regulations
of
brotherhood
which
are
not
of
record.
with
respect
to
which
there's
been
no
evidence
taken
at
all
as
to
their
interpretation
or
their
application
to
this
particular
situation.
there
are
only
a
very
few
limited
facts
before
the
court
on
this
question
of
venue
and
what
were
there
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
not
on
our
approach,
no,
your
honor.
it
does
make
a
different
apparently
on
the
approach
of
the
railroad
area.
we
before
the
district
court
put
in
a
limited
number
of
facts
which
were
not
contradicted,
namely,
that
the
headquarters
of
the
b.r.t.
were
in
cleveland,
ohio.
that
the
b.r.t.
maintained
no
office
in
denver,
colorado,
that
it's
only
connection
with
denver,
colorado
was
it
had
some
members
at
denver,
colardo.
and
that
for
its
grievance
committee
located
in
denver,
colorado
made
up
of
members
of
the
b.r.t.
on
the
denver
&
rio
grande
railroad
of
which
mr.
r.
e.
carroll
was
chairman.
those
were
the
only
facts
before
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
venue
question.
now
those
facts,
i
am
going
to
now
proceed
to
discuss
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
first,
i
think
we
have
to
decide
which
statute
we're
interpreting.
counsel
has
made
no
reference
at
all
to
the
amendment
of
the
venue
statute
which
took
place
on
november
2,
1966
about
six
or
seven
weeks
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
which
provided
that
in
addition
--
that
in
non
--
the
diversity
action
such
as
this,
there
could
be
suit
brought
not
only
in
the
judicial
district
of
the
residence
of
the
defendants
but
also
where
the
claim
arose.
now,
the
railroad
has
not
made
any
assertion
in
this
case
that
this
amended
statute
was
applicable
to
this
particular
case
were
controlling.
i
must
say
in
all
fairness
that
both
counsel
and
myself
are
operating
under
a
restriction
with
respect
to
this
issue
of
the
application
of
this
amended
statute
because
we
--
all
that
--
filed
briefs
almost
on
the
same
day
with
this
court
in
another
case
in
which
this
precise
issue
was
involved
with
a
suit
to
enforce
one
of
these
two
adjustment
board
awards
here.
i
must
say
that
in
all
candor
that
the
basis
of
my
brief
in
that
case
and
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
u.s.
v.
alabama,
i
believe
that
the
amended
statute
is
applicable
even
though
it
creates
an
additional
issue
for
me
to
dispose
of.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
it's
applicable
with
this
case
in
determining
whether
the
venue
was
proper
in
the
judicial
district
of
colorado.
now,
i
would
have
to
therefore
discuss
briefly
with
you
this
question
of
which
there
were
no
evidence
taken
in
the
district
court
or
no
argument
made
in
the
district
court.
of
course,
in
the
court
of
appeals
directed
to
this
but
that
was
simply
that
whether
this
claim
arose
in
colorado
and
it's
our
position
that
the
whole
claim
did
not
arise
in
colorado
for
the
facts
which
i've
just
been
stating
to
you.
the
record
is
clear
that
a
part
of
the
strike
occurred
in
utah,
that
a
part
of
the
injury
occurred
in
utah
that
they
are
claiming
here,
part
of
the
diversion
occurred
in
utah.
consequently
a
part
and
the
record
does
not
show
how
much
of
the
claim
was
a
utah
claim,
not
a
colorado
claim.
and
i
believe
that
under
the
amended
statute,
they
would
have
had
to
brought
suits
one
in
utah
and
one
in
colorado
if
they
could
otherwise
sue
under
this
and
that
there
would
had
to
been
an
effort
to
transfer
one
or
the
other.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
that
interpreting
a
provision
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959
which
establishes
venue
for
actions
under
section
1,
both
on
the
principal
place
of
business
of
a
union
and
also
where
the
violation
occurred.
and
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
decisions,
one
exception
under
that
upheld
that
the
violation
occurs
where
the
decision
is
actually
made.
they
don't
apply
the
classic
tort
principle
of
where
the
injury
occurred.
but
if
the
injury
did
occur
outside
of
ohio
here
where
the
decision
to
conduct
the
strike
was
made
but
did
not
occur
solely
in
the
district
of
colorado
to
give
this
carrier
a
single
claim
in
that
judicial
district,
in
other
words,
the
claim
which
it
prosecuted
here
and
for
which
it
received
the
amount
of
damages
here.
this
brings
us
to
the
basic
question
which
was
argued
in
the
railroad's
brief
in
here
today,
namely,
that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
residence
provision
of
section
1391
(b)
in
title
xxviii.
and
i
think
that
it
is
beyond
question
that
simply
what
the
railroad
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
read
section
1391
(c)
which
applies
--
mentions
specifically
as
limited
by
its
language
to
corporations
so
as
if
--
it
also
includes
unincorporated
associations.
now
this
is
specifically
and
exactly
what
it
said
in
its
main
brief.
this
is
specifically
and
exactly
what
the
amicus
brief
for
the
railroad
had
said
no.
in
their
reply
brief,
the
railroads,
after
reading
our
brief,
apparently
had
thought
a
little
better
of
this
and
now
we're
trying
to
argue
that
--
oh,
really,
all
they're
asking
is
an
interpretation
of
residence
of
--
provisions
of
section
1391
(b).
but
they
can
only
get
to
the
interpretation
that
they
argue
for
by
having
this
court
read
section
1391
(c)
as
if
it
includes
unincorporated
associations
when
it
does
not.
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
cannot
read
section
1391
(c)
as
including
unincorporated
associations
unless
it
simply
legislates
and
that
this
court
should
not
do
that.
now
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
where
would
the
proper
venue
be
on
residence
requirements,
the
proper
venue
could
be
either
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
your
honor,
or
it
could
be
under
the
district
of
columbia
statute
which
permit
suits
or
you
can
be
found,
it
could
be
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but
it
could
not
be
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
but
what
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
now
what
the
--
well,
looking
at
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that
the
brotherhood
was
resided
--
the
brotherhood
is
a
jural
entity
resided
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
can,
your
honor,
because
prior
to
the
use
of
the
residence
language,
the
statute
for
great
many
years,
read
inhabitant
and
the
word
inhabitant
had
been
interpreted
and
there's
no
question
about
this.
this
is
conceded
by
the
other
side
on
their
briefs
if
the
word
inhabitant
had
been
interpreted
to
mean
as
applied
to
unincorporated
association
in
the
place
where
its
principal
headquarters
were
located.
when
the
word
residence
was
substituted
by
the
1948
revisions,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
was
done
--
simply
the
clarity
was
not
intended
to
change
the
impact
of
the
provision
because
it
said
that
the
word
residence
and
in
(inaudible)
were
synonymous
and
there
was
no
intent
to
change
that.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no.
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
had
--
i
would
not
be
able
to
agree
with
that
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
i
said
--
i
believe
what
i
was
mentioning,
your
honor,
in
the
graham
case,
this
court
said
that
a
railway
labor
organization
could
be
sued
in
the
district
of
columbia.
under
the
district
of
columbia
venue
statute
that
permits
a
suit
where
you're
found,
it
could
be
sued,
the
federal
district
court
here.
and
that
union
as
does
most
of
these
unions
have
--
has
a
national
legislative
headquarters
here
so
that
it
can
be
said
to
be
found
within
the
district
of
columbia
but
your
honors
also
quite
right
as
to
the
substance
of
bouligny
holding.
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
applying
the
bouligny
ruling
in
terms
of
the
substance
or
subject
matter
of
its
ruling
as
to
whether
or
not
an
unincorporated
association
was
a
jural
entity.
nobody
is
arguing
about
in
this
case.
you
could
sue
the
b.r.t.
here
as
a
jural
entity
under
rule
1706
(b)
of
the
federal
rule
because
this
was
an
action
based
on
a
federal
statute.
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
in
the
bouligny
--
in
reference
to
bouligny
case
was,
in
that
case,
the
identical
argument
was
made
for
interpreting
section
1332
that
is
made
here
for
applying
the
interpretation
of
section
1391
(c)
urged
by
the
railroad
and
that
argument
was
that
unincorporated
associations
should
be
treated
as
corporations.
that
as
a
practical
matter
of
their
--
now
like
corporations
that
in
the
practicalities
of
litigation
they
should
be
so
treated.
that
particular
case,
the
argument
was
made
by
a
union,
the
united
state
--
the
steelworkers.
this
court
said
that,
however,
appealing
this
argument
might
be,
it
was
that
argument
which
was
advanced
these
legislative
reasons
for
interpreting
the
statute
and
the
argument
should
be
addressed
to
congress.
and
identically,
the
same
identical
argument
is
the
argument
which
is
relied
upon
here
by
the
carriers
and
is
the
argument
which
goes
back
and
is
derived
from
the
rutland
case
before
the
second
circuit.
and
of
course,
the
second
circuit
also
in
that
case
conceded
that
the
--
there
was
no
language
in
the
statute
on
which
they
could
base
this.
it
simply
said
it
was
relying
on
audit
regarded
as
this
rule
of
practicality.
and
the
court
--
this
court
has
said
in
the
bouligny
case,
“you
can't
rely
on
this
rule
of
practicality
for
a
rule
to
interpret
the
statute.”
it
say,
"it's
an
argument
that
should
be
addressed
to
come,
the
jurisdiction".
yes,
jurisdiction
was
involved
in
that
venue
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
on
the
principle
of
interpreting
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
the
principle
is
the
use
of
this
type
of
legislative
material
where
you
have
no
language
and
you
have
no
legislative
history,
which
are
the
normal
tools
for
interpreting
statutes.
you
can't
rely
on
a
practicality
argument
like
this.
that's
the
real
significance
of
the
bouligny
case
as
applied
to
this
situation
and
it
makes
no
difference.
whether
the
bouligny
case
dealt
with
jurisdiction
of
what
it
dealt
with
this
as
far
as
the
application
of
that
particular
principle
one.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
if
you
applied
the
--
i
believe,
your
honor,
though
this
is
the
argument
made
by
the
carrier
this
--
what
you're
referring
to
now
does
appear
in
the
brief
of
the
national
railway
labor
conference's
amicus
but
the
carrier
itself
makes
a
different
argument
and
i
think
that
the
--
that
that
argument
at
least
put
some
correct
setting,
the
substance
of
the
bouligny
decision
on
the
subject
matter
and
that
--
its
argument
is,
is
that
if
the
substance
of
the
bouligny
decision
as
applied
to
the
venue
problem,
then
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
sue
in
any
judicial
district
because
all
of
the
members
obviously
aren't
residents
of
any
particular
judicial
district.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
don't
believe
that
rule
of
law
ever
existed,
your
honor,
and
there's
no
argument
in
this
case
at
all
that
as
i
said
that
--
that
you
can't
sue
the
b.r.t.
as
an
entity.
you
clearly
could
under
the
federal
rules
in
the
coronado
case.
the
only
question
is
taking
as
a
--
as
an
entity,
as
a
jural
entity,
where
is
it
located
for
the
purpose
of
(inaudible)?
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
i
believe
at
the
outset
that
i
should
straighten
out
a
few
of
the
facts
that
have
been
stated
by
counsel.
most
of
the
facts
that
he
stated,
either
are
not
of
the
record
and
the
remainder
of
them,
i
don't'
believe
he
has
accurately
stated.
counsel
stated
that
the
strike
which
was
here
involved
grew
out
of
the
carrier's
refusal
to
accept
awards,
the
payment
of
money,
involving
payment
of
money.
however,
in
one
of
the
two
awards,
the
carrier
refused
to
put
into
effect
the
contract
--
interpretation
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
which
in
our
opinion
was
in
and
of
itself
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
also
at
the
time
of
the
strike
occurred,
it
was
some
two
years
later
that
this
court
finally
held
that
railroad
employees
were
prohibited
in
conducting
this
type
of
strike.
and
counsel
says
that
the
strike
occurred
mostly
in
the
judicial
district
of
colorado
but
most
of
the
railroad
employees
are
in
this
judicial
district.
the
record
contains
nothing
at
all
on
this.
the
strike
did
occur
in
colorado.
it
also
occurred
to
some
extent
in
utah.
how
much
--
how
many
employees
were
involved
in
colorado,
how
many
in
utah
is
not
of
record.
counsel
says
that
the
b.r.t.,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
acts,
it
carries
on
its
representation
that
both
covered
in
colorado,
for
its
members
in
colorado.
this
is
not
a
fact
of
record.
counsel
relies
upon
an
appendix
in
the
brief
with
respect
to
rules
and
regulations
of
brotherhood
which
are
not
of
record.
with
respect
to
which
there's
been
no
evidence
taken
at
all
as
to
their
interpretation
or
their
application
to
this
particular
situation.
there
are
only
a
very
few
limited
facts
before
the
court
on
this
question
of
venue
and
what
were
there
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
not
on
our
approach,
no,
your
honor.
it
does
make
a
different
apparently
on
the
approach
of
the
railroad
area.
we
before
the
district
court
put
in
a
limited
number
of
facts
which
were
not
contradicted,
namely,
that
the
headquarters
of
the
b.r.t.
were
in
cleveland,
ohio.
that
the
b.r.t.
maintained
no
office
in
denver,
colorado,
that
it's
only
connection
with
denver,
colorado
was
it
had
some
members
at
denver,
colardo.
and
that
for
its
grievance
committee
located
in
denver,
colorado
made
up
of
members
of
the
b.r.t.
on
the
denver
&
rio
grande
railroad
of
which
mr.
r.
e.
carroll
was
chairman.
those
were
the
only
facts
before
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
venue
question.
now
those
facts,
i
am
going
to
now
proceed
to
discuss
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
first,
i
think
we
have
to
decide
which
statute
we're
interpreting.
counsel
has
made
no
reference
at
all
to
the
amendment
of
the
venue
statute
which
took
place
on
november
2,
1966
about
six
or
seven
weeks
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
which
provided
that
in
addition
--
that
in
non
--
the
diversity
action
such
as
this,
there
could
be
suit
brought
not
only
in
the
judicial
district
of
the
residence
of
the
defendants
but
also
where
the
claim
arose.
now,
the
railroad
has
not
made
any
assertion
in
this
case
that
this
amended
statute
was
applicable
to
this
particular
case
were
controlling.
i
must
say
in
all
fairness
that
both
counsel
and
myself
are
operating
under
a
restriction
with
respect
to
this
issue
of
the
application
of
this
amended
statute
because
we
--
all
that
--
filed
briefs
almost
on
the
same
day
with
this
court
in
another
case
in
which
this
precise
issue
was
involved
with
a
suit
to
enforce
one
of
these
two
adjustment
board
awards
here.
i
must
say
that
in
all
candor
that
the
basis
of
my
brief
in
that
case
and
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
u.s.
v.
alabama,
i
believe
that
the
amended
statute
is
applicable
even
though
it
creates
an
additional
issue
for
me
to
dispose
of.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
it's
applicable
with
this
case
in
determining
whether
the
venue
was
proper
in
the
judicial
district
of
colorado.
now,
i
would
have
to
therefore
discuss
briefly
with
you
this
question
of
which
there
were
no
evidence
taken
in
the
district
court
or
no
argument
made
in
the
district
court.
of
course,
in
the
court
of
appeals
directed
to
this
but
that
was
simply
that
whether
this
claim
arose
in
colorado
and
it's
our
position
that
the
whole
claim
did
not
arise
in
colorado
for
the
facts
which
i've
just
been
stating
to
you.
the
record
is
clear
that
a
part
of
the
strike
occurred
in
utah,
that
a
part
of
the
injury
occurred
in
utah
that
they
are
claiming
here,
part
of
the
diversion
occurred
in
utah.
consequently
a
part
and
the
record
does
not
show
how
much
of
the
claim
was
a
utah
claim,
not
a
colorado
claim.
and
i
believe
that
under
the
amended
statute,
they
would
have
had
to
brought
suits
one
in
utah
and
one
in
colorado
if
they
could
otherwise
sue
under
this
and
that
there
would
had
to
been
an
effort
to
transfer
one
or
the
other.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
that
interpreting
a
provision
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959
which
establishes
venue
for
actions
under
section
1,
both
on
the
principal
place
of
business
of
a
union
and
also
where
the
violation
occurred.
and
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
decisions,
one
exception
under
that
upheld
that
the
violation
occurs
where
the
decision
is
actually
made.
they
don't
apply
the
classic
tort
principle
of
where
the
injury
occurred.
but
if
the
injury
did
occur
outside
of
ohio
here
where
the
decision
to
conduct
the
strike
was
made
but
did
not
occur
solely
in
the
district
of
colorado
to
give
this
carrier
a
single
claim
in
that
judicial
district,
in
other
words,
the
claim
which
it
prosecuted
here
and
for
which
it
received
the
amount
of
damages
here.
this
brings
us
to
the
basic
question
which
was
argued
in
the
railroad's
brief
in
here
today,
namely,
that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
residence
provision
of
section
1391
(b)
in
title
xxviii.
and
i
think
that
it
is
beyond
question
that
simply
what
the
railroad
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
read
section
1391
(c)
which
applies
--
mentions
specifically
as
limited
by
its
language
to
corporations
so
as
if
--
it
also
includes
unincorporated
associations.
now
this
is
specifically
and
exactly
what
it
said
in
its
main
brief.
this
is
specifically
and
exactly
what
the
amicus
brief
for
the
railroad
had
said
no.
in
their
reply
brief,
the
railroads,
after
reading
our
brief,
apparently
had
thought
a
little
better
of
this
and
now
we're
trying
to
argue
that
--
oh,
really,
all
they're
asking
is
an
interpretation
of
residence
of
--
provisions
of
section
1391
(b).
but
they
can
only
get
to
the
interpretation
that
they
argue
for
by
having
this
court
read
section
1391
(c)
as
if
it
includes
unincorporated
associations
when
it
does
not.
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
cannot
read
section
1391
(c)
as
including
unincorporated
associations
unless
it
simply
legislates
and
that
this
court
should
not
do
that.
now
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
where
would
the
proper
venue
be
on
residence
requirements,
the
proper
venue
could
be
either
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
your
honor,
or
it
could
be
under
the
district
of
columbia
statute
which
permit
suits
or
you
can
be
found,
it
could
be
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but
it
could
not
be
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
but
what
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
now
what
the
--
well,
looking
at
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that
the
brotherhood
was
resided
--
the
brotherhood
is
a
jural
entity
resided
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
can,
your
honor,
because
prior
to
the
use
of
the
residence
language,
the
statute
for
great
many
years,
read
inhabitant
and
the
word
inhabitant
had
been
interpreted
and
there's
no
question
about
this.
this
is
conceded
by
the
other
side
on
their
briefs
if
the
word
inhabitant
had
been
interpreted
to
mean
as
applied
to
unincorporated
association
in
the
place
where
its
principal
headquarters
were
located.
when
the
word
residence
was
substituted
by
the
1948
revisions,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
was
done
--
simply
the
clarity
was
not
intended
to
change
the
impact
of
the
provision
because
it
said
that
the
word
residence
and
in
(inaudible)
were
synonymous
and
there
was
no
intent
to
change
that.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no.
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
had
--
i
would
not
be
able
to
agree
with
that
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
i
said
--
i
believe
what
i
was
mentioning,
your
honor,
in
the
graham
case,
this
court
said
that
a
railway
labor
organization
could
be
sued
in
the
district
of
columbia.
under
the
district
of
columbia
venue
statute
that
permits
a
suit
where
you're
found,
it
could
be
sued,
the
federal
district
court
here.
and
that
union
as
does
most
of
these
unions
have
--
has
a
national
legislative
headquarters
here
so
that
it
can
be
said
to
be
found
within
the
district
of
columbia
but
your
honors
also
quite
right
as
to
the
substance
of
bouligny
holding.
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
applying
the
bouligny
ruling
in
terms
of
the
substance
or
subject
matter
of
its
ruling
as
to
whether
or
not
an
unincorporated
association
was
a
jural
entity.
nobody
is
arguing
about
in
this
case.
you
could
sue
the
b.r.t.
here
as
a
jural
entity
under
rule
1706
(b)
of
the
federal
rule
because
this
was
an
action
based
on
a
federal
statute.
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
in
the
bouligny
--
in
reference
to
bouligny
case
was,
in
that
case,
the
identical
argument
was
made
for
interpreting
section
1332
that
is
made
here
for
applying
the
interpretation
of
section
1391
(c)
urged
by
the
railroad
and
that
argument
was
that
unincorporated
associations
should
be
treated
as
corporations.
that
as
a
practical
matter
of
their
--
now
like
corporations
that
in
the
practicalities
of
litigation
they
should
be
so
treated.
that
particular
case,
the
argument
was
made
by
a
union,
the
united
state
--
the
steelworkers.
this
court
said
that,
however,
appealing
this
argument
might
be,
it
was
that
argument
which
was
advanced
these
legislative
reasons
for
interpreting
the
statute
and
the
argument
should
be
addressed
to
congress.
and
identically,
the
same
identical
argument
is
the
argument
which
is
relied
upon
here
by
the
carriers
and
is
the
argument
which
goes
back
and
is
derived
from
the
rutland
case
before
the
second
circuit.
and
of
course,
the
second
circuit
also
in
that
case
conceded
that
the
--
there
was
no
language
in
the
statute
on
which
they
could
base
this.
it
simply
said
it
was
relying
on
audit
regarded
as
this
rule
of
practicality.
and
the
court
--
this
court
has
said
in
the
bouligny
case,
“you
can't
rely
on
this
rule
of
practicality
for
a
rule
to
interpret
the
statute.”
it
say,
"it's
an
argument
that
should
be
addressed
to
come,
the
jurisdiction".
yes,
jurisdiction
was
involved
in
that
venue
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
on
the
principle
of
interpreting
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
the
principle
is
the
use
of
this
type
of
legislative
material
where
you
have
no
language
and
you
have
no
legislative
history,
which
are
the
normal
tools
for
interpreting
statutes.
you
can't
rely
on
a
practicality
argument
like
this.
that's
the
real
significance
of
the
bouligny
case
as
applied
to
this
situation
and
it
makes
no
difference.
whether
the
bouligny
case
dealt
with
jurisdiction
of
what
it
dealt
with
this
as
far
as
the
application
of
that
particular
principle
one.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
if
you
applied
the
--
i
believe,
your
honor,
though
this
is
the
argument
made
by
the
carrier
this
--
what
you're
referring
to
now
does
appear
in
the
brief
of
the
national
railway
labor
conference's
amicus
but
the
carrier
itself
makes
a
different
argument
and
i
think
that
the
--
that
that
argument
at
least
put
some
correct
setting,
the
substance
of
the
bouligny
decision
on
the
subject
matter
and
that
--
its
argument
is,
is
that
if
the
substance
of
the
bouligny
decision
as
applied
to
the
venue
problem,
then
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
sue
in
any
judicial
district
because
all
of
the
members
obviously
aren't
residents
of
any
particular
judicial
district.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
don't
believe
that
rule
of
law
ever
existed,
your
honor,
and
there's
no
argument
in
this
case
at
all
that
as
i
said
that
--
that
you
can't
sue
the
b.r.t.
as
an
entity.
you
clearly
could
under
the
federal
rules
in
the
coronado
case.
the
only
question
is
taking
as
a
--
as
an
entity,
as
a
jural
entity,
where
is
it
located
for
the
purpose
of
(inaudible)?
