fortas
the
payee
did
not
join
in
this
action?
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
suppose
that
they
did
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well
if
we
should
decide
this
case
in
favor
of
the
bank,
would
our
holding
necessarily
also
apply
to
the
payee?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
take
a
case
where
the
payee
--
the
payment
to
the
payee
would
not
have
been
practiced.
i
supposed
such
a
case
is
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say,
if
he
should
hold
here
that
the
bank
is
protected
on
account
of
this
payment
if
they
did
not
have
notice
or
knowledge
and
that
would
apply
also
to
the
payee?
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
really
go
to
the
likelihood
--
the
question
whether
the
payee
would
have
knowledge
or
not
but
it
would
not
affect
a
legal
principle
involved.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
it
somewhat
--
if
in
this
case
the
payment
to
the
payee
would
be
a
preference,
would
that
defense
may
available
to
the
bank
in
this
contribution
action?
justice
abe
fortas
then
on
what
theory
where
the
bank
have
to
make
contribution
to
the
payee?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
that
is
--
centers
a
validity
of
the
trustee's
determination
of
the
bank
and
the
payee
were
liable.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
the
question
that
you
got
up
here.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
won't
settle
the
problem
of
the
contribution
and
the
question
of
preference,
won't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
if
the
bank
is
jointly
liable?
justice
abe
fortas
they
won't
preclude
the
making
of
the
defense.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)some
way
that
the
payee
can
annoy
that
--
the
payments,
because
of
its
preference.
justice
abe
fortas
you
usually
have
two
parties.
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
cause
--
if
you
win
--
but
if
you
win
this
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
can
we
decide
in
this
case
the
liability
of
the
payee
as
related
to
the
bank.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
--
but
nothing,
what
would
change
if
the
court
agreed
with
you
and
said
the
bank
is
not
liable
at
all.
and
we
handed
down
a
mandate
in
that
effect.
nothing
happens?
then
nothing
happens,
is
the
--
the
money
that
the
trustee
got,
he
keeps.
the
money
that
the
payee
has
got,
he
--
doesn't
get
back?
and
he
may
still
go
on
with
his
lawsuit
against
you
in
the
california
courts.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
as
far
as
he's
concerned,
he
didn't
file.
justice
abe
fortas
he'd
be
liable
for
the
cause,
wouldn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
the
payee
did

action?
