(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happens
to
the
payee
in
this
law
suit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
has
his
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
do
we
have
a
case
or
controversy
between
the
trustee
and
yourself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
in
the
real
lawsuit
needs
to
be
tried,
the
other
one
between
the
bank
and
the
payee?
but
why
is
in
this
just
an
indirect
method
of
giving
up
a
case
when
its
all
really
a
--
can
cause
a
litigation
between
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
that
should
be
moot
or
that
the
judgment
should
be
vacated
as
moot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'll
have
your
lawsuit
then
with
the
payee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
payee
or
is
that
responsible
financially?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
really
have
a
litigation
here
now,
it's
between
the
bank
and
the
payee.
i
mean
that's
where
the
real
lawsuit
is
because
the
trustee
has
its
money.
he
is
in
no
danger
of
losing
his
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
right,
the
bank
and
--
quite
between
the
bank
and
the
payee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
at
all
with
the
judgment
but
the
judgment
might
be
dismissed
as
moot,
vacated
as
moot
since
there's
no
controversy
there
between
the
trustee
and
anybody.
trustee
has
its
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
out
mandate
and
the
judgment
before
us
is
what?
a
judgment
against
both
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
we
do?
we
set
aside
the
judgment
if
you
prevail
only
as
against
the
bank,
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
the
payee
didn't
appeal
or
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
be
making
up
this
argument
though
if
in
fact
the
deposits
had
been
made
before
bankruptcy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
bank
appealed
that
part
of
the
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
we
on
there
--
the
$2000
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
happen
if
we
were
to
--
got
told
there
that
the
bank
is
not
liable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
hold
the
bank
is
not
liable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
very
serious.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you're
not
thinking
of
the
payee,
not
very
serious
for
him,
you
mean
very
serious
in
the
bankruptcy
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
until
he
had
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
so
serious
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
this
world
of
ours,
sometimes
more
than
one
person
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
more
than
one
person
interested
in
this
bank.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
bank,
it
has
the
account.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
so
outrageous
about
holding
if
the
bank
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
responsible
and
that
they
had
knowledge
of
the
bankruptcy?
i
don't
suppose
to
pay
off
this
money.
it's
an
obligation
to
pay
the
money
when
he
gets
to
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
is
if
you
hold
that
he
has
got
to
pay
to
the
trustee
without
knowing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
knowing
it
that
there
is
a
trustee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
says
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
you
say,
--
you
keep
saying
congress
had
this
precise
problem.
what
number
of
congress
do
you
think
or
what
number
of
the
senate
was
informed
that
the
passage
of
this
law
hold
a
bank
liable,
but
before
they're
notified
of
a
bankruptcy
being
a
check
off
in
due
course
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
any
congress
or
senator
would
has
voted
for
a
bill
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
say
(voice
overlap)
--
about
a
bank
in
this
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anything
said
about
a
bank
in
the
situation
like
we
have
today
to
the
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
--
but
he
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
dedicate
but
he
knew
they
were
gong
to
hold
him
liable
like
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
cases.
you're
talking
about
legislative
history
in
congress..
what
did
congress
have
to
notify
them
if
they
would
be
liable

the
situation
of

bank
would
be
liable
in
