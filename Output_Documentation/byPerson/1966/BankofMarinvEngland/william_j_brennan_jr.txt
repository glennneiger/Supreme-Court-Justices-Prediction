justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
--
if
the
money,
the
bankrupt's
money
is
paid
out
of
the
bank
upon
the
payment
of
the
check,
that's
after
bankruptcy,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
any
transfer
of
the
--
that
you
know
of,
of
the
bankrupt's
property
after
the
date
of
filing
a
petition
ever
a
preference?
i
mean
technically
called
a
preference?
doesn't
--
isn't
it
just
the
case
of
somebody
appropriating
the
assets
of
the
bankrupt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
trustee
then
is
obligated
to
seek
an
alternative
order
if
somebody's
appropriate
in
the
bankrupt's
property
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
go
around
and
prove
the
other
elements
with
preference
to
get
the
money
back,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
trustee
--
this
property
supposedly
came
the
trustee's
property
as
to
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
some
property
was
transferred
afterwards,
he
doesn't
have
to
get
--
in
order
to
get
it
back
proves
that
the
elements
of
the
preference,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
understand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
could
there
be
a
preference
in
this
case
at
all
in
this
circumstance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
the
judgment
here
is
randomly,
just
turn
on
an
order
or
else
he
gets
both
the
bank
and
the
payee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
means,
as
far
as
i
concede
that
that
both
of
them
are
responsible
for
appropriating
the
bankrupt's
property
to
the
trustee's
property
after
bankruptcy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
a
preference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
if
he
could
under
these
facts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
that
may
not
formerly
have
been.
the
judgment
i
gather
against
the
two
has
now
been
paid
by
your
codefendant
having
paid
the
trustee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
that's
the
limited
extent
to
which
the
judgment
survives,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
supposed
that
if
we
did
this,
then
what
survives
in
the
way
of
a
judgment
which
supports
the
payee's
contributions
suit
against
the
bank.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
trustee
loses
the
cause
that
we
decide
in
favor
of
the
bank.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
in
this
case
the
bankrupt
had
sent
the
bank
$2300
in
cash
and
said
please
pay
off
eureka
fish
market,
we
owe
them
$2300.
sent
down
cash
and
everything
that
happened
here,
it
happened
and
the
bank
without
knowledge
of
the
bankruptcy
pays
the
$2300
cash
to
eureka,
would
you
still
have
a
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
yes
because
many
of
these
checks
were
outstanding
for
weeks
weren't
they
before
they
were
presented?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
they
probably
gave
them
asset
that
they
hold
it,
and
i
will
cover
it,
when
i
collect
on
some
of
