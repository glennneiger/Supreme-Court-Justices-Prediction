well,
do
you
think
one
reason
for

is
that
unless
you
can

and
that
this
--
that
if
you
can
go
after
the
bank,
the
bank
pays
you
the

and
the
bank
--
the
money
that
the

has
paid
the
payee
remains
with
the
payee
and
the

can't
get
it
back
which
means
there's
some
--
well,
that's
the
claim
against

justice

white
that
really
--
i
mean
it,
the
reason
it
really
does
do
some
good
is
--
it
is
because
the
bank
does
pay
twice.
justice
byron

white
you
mean,
what
--
it
could
afford
to
pay
twice?
justice
byron

white
this
kind
of
a
lawsuit
only
comes
up
when
the
bank
has
already
paid
the
payee?
justice
byron

white
a
simple
case
is
just
where
there
are
some
checks
outstanding
at
the

case
and
the

pay
as
they
are
presented
to
the

they're
paid.
justice

and
--
was
then
--
then
the
payee
pockets
the
money
and
the
trustee
finds
out
that
the
check
has
paid
after
bankruptcy
and
he
asks
for
the
money
back
in
the
bank.
and
he
wants
the
money
back
from
the

and
if
the
bank
pays
it,
what's
the
bank's
cause
of
action
against
the

justice

white
now,
but
the
payee
is
liable
to
say,
"well,
now
look,
at
the
time
i
got
the

bankruptcy
has
not

it

justice

alright.
justice

alright,
so
in
that
case,
in
my
case
where
the

has
made
a

before
or
a
cash
--
yes,
say
under

just
before
bankruptcy.
he
gets
the

it
after

the
payee
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
keep
that
money.
justice
byron

white
and
then
you
wanted
--
you
want
--
you
have
to
be
able
to
get
the
money
from
the
bank?
justice
byron

white
yes,
but
the
rule,
it's

(inaudible)
for
that
case.
justice
byron

white
did
they
pay
the

in

and
the

must
to
pay
two.
justice

white
the
fact
--
that
in
this
case
the
--
justice
byron

white
--
deposit
were
in
fact
made
after
bankruptcy
is
immaterial
on
legal
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
in
effect
is
as
a
bank,
even
though
it
knows
nothing
about
bankruptcy
is
liable
to
pay
valid
checks
with
which
the
depositor
has
presented

paid
to
somebody

justice

white
makes
no
difference
whether
it
knows
it
or
not?
justice
byron

white
may
i
ask
you
something
about
the
judgment?
the
judgment
provides
--
the
judgment
against
the
bank
a
loan,
$700.47,
surviving
judgment
against
both
the
bank
and
the
payee
$2312,
what's
the
--
what's
the
cause
of
that?
justice
byron

white
it's
on
the

justice
byron

white
well,
what
about
the
700?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
we
--
justice
byron
r.
white
until
he
has
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
normally,
say
in
a
reorganization
or
in
some
bankruptcy,
the
longer
the
adjudication
is,
there
is
an
issue
of
an
injunction.
is
anybody
transferring
a
property
of
the
bankrupt?
or
is
it
a
chapter
x
case?
anyway,
you
suppose
the
bank
is
--
suppose
the
bank
in
those
circumstances
would
be
subject
to
contempt
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
without
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
be
responsible
for
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
in
due
course
does
the
bank
--
whether
a
bank
get
notice?
now,
you
--
this
is
a
voluntary
petition,
they
have
various
schedules
of
the
voluntary
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
shows
--
and
it
--
and
you
itemize
your
inventory,
your
assets,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
list
your
--
the
people
that
you
owe.
now
for
the
first
reading,
i
supposed
that
for
the
voluntary
petition,
what
happens
then,
notice
wise,
in
an
ordinary
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
i'm
just
saying
that
in
the
normal
bankruptcy,
doesn't
it
--
that
the
--
when
there's
any
aspects
revealed,
what
happens
about
loading,
you
know
that
paper
notice
to
the
first
meeting
of
creditors,
you
know
that.
but
is
that
normally
the
first
to
know
as
opposed
to
anybody?
when
would
the
bank
normally
get
notice
if
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
aren't
receivers
all
the
time,
they
are
only
--
justice
byron
r.
white
until
noticed.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
in
a
case
where
there
is
not
a
receiver,
i
supposed
the
notice
would
come
from
a
trustee
for
the
trustee
is
charged
with
collecting
the
assets
to
bankrupt
and
as
soon
as
he
deployed
it,
his
jobs
to
go
and
make
sure
that
the
assets
are
preserved.
that's
where
he
gets
the
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
then
in
on
a
voluntary
petition
on
a
voluntary
petition
there's
usually
an
adjudication
that
day,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
trustee
is
usually
appointed
that
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
--
i
just
said
usually.
how
about
in
your
court
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
because
you
had
a
receiver.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
so
your
answer
to
chief
justice
is
that
--
well
the
--
what
protects
the
bank
if
the
bank
can
get
the
money
from
the
payee?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
think
if
you
--
i
think
the
bank
could
have
a
tough
time
to
get
that
money
back
from
the
payee
and
take
this
for
the
payee,
as
this
is
the
preference.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
a
--
i
suppose
if
you
lose
this
case,
anybody
inside
the
bankrupt
company
with
some
assets,
and
with
a
bank
account,
could
write
a
check
on
that
bank
account
to
a
print.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
print
could
get
it
in
(inaudible)
and
if
the
bank
isn't
liable,
nobody
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
it
will
stop
the
fraud.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
won't
stop
the
fraud
but
it
--
all
it
means
is
that
the
--
instead
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
taking
the
loss,
the
bank
will
take
it.
and
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
that
the
transfer
was
the
honoring
of
the
checks
by
the
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

his
money?
justice
byron

that's
not
the

you
asked
if
the
cause
against

white

you
did
not
pay

you,

r.
white
so
you
--
so
your
answer
to
chief
justice
is
that
--
well
the
--
what
protects
the
bank
if
the
bank
can
get
the
money
from
the
payee?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
think
if
you
--
i
think
the
bank
could
have
a
tough
time
to
get
that
money
back
from
the
payee
and
take
this
for
the
payee,
as
this
is
the
preference.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
a
--
i
suppose
if
you
lose
this
case,
anybody
inside
the
bankrupt
company
with
some
assets,
and
with
a
bank
account,
could
write
a
check
on
that
bank
account
to
a
print.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
print
could
get
it
in
(inaudible)
and
if
the
bank
isn't
liable,
nobody
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
it
will
stop
the
fraud.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
won't
stop
the
fraud
but
it
--
all
it
means
is
that
the
--
instead
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
taking
the
loss,
the
bank
will
take
it.
and
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
that
the
transfer
was
the
honoring
of
the
checks
by
the
bank.
