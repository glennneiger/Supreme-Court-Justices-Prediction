petitioner

trustee
of

mr.
washburn.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
interest
of
the
trustee
if
he's
been
paid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wasn't
assuming
that
you're
going
to
moot
your
case
and
leave
a
stand.
but
i
was
just
wondering
what
interest
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
can
have
against
the
bank
if
the
trustee
is
already
been
paid
in
full
fault
by
the
payee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
then
the
judgment,
what's
left,
it
wouldn't
be
discharged
by
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
what
is
your
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
suit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
you
want
some
guidelines
on
how
you
shall
act
in
the
future?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
advisory
verdict
revised
with
the
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
you're
pleading
for
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
distresses
as
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
he
notices
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seems
to
me
that
this
--
the
same
would
happen
numerous
time
throughout
the
country
every
year.
there
must
be
some
practice
in
the
banking
world
and
then
under
the
bankruptcy
laws
throughout
the
country,
what
has
been
the
experience
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i
would
like
to
ask
you
is
this,
assume
that
you
are
successful
in
this
lawsuit,
how
would
the
bank
protect
itself
against
these
kinds
of
laws
where
its
acting
in
good
faith,
has
no
knowledge
of
any
kind
and
is
honoring
the
checks
of
his
deposit,
how
would
it
protect
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
follow.
i
think
the
most
you
could
say
would
be
that
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
would
have
a
better
chance
to
get
the
money
from
the
bank
that
he
would
for
the
--
from
the
payee.
but
the
payee
certainly
could
be
held
liable
if
he
receive
money
that
he
shouldn't
have
received
under
the
bankruptcy
laws
but
this
way
the
bank
has
to
pay
twice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
donovan,
as
i
understand
you,
this
transaction
could
not
be
considered
a
preference
because
it
happened
after
the
adjudication,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
just
--
i
just
--
what
i
want
to
ask
you,
is
this,
you
are
saying
what
a
terrible
thing
it
would
be
if
you
lost
this
lawsuit.
now,
i
wonder
whether
there
would
be
any
difference
in
the
trustee's
position
as
concerns
this
in
relation
to
the
payee
than
if
it
had
been
a
preference?
you
have
to
sue
the
payee
don't
you
if
it
was
a
preference
to
get
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
back?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
you
have
to
pursue
--
you
have
to
pursue
the
payee
the
one
whom
you
alleged
got
the
preference,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
you
be
in
any
worst
position
here
if
you
had
to
pursue
the
payee
who
got
the
benefit
of
this
money
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
rather
than
the
bank
who
paid
it
out
in
due
course?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
that's
what
i
was
asking
you
a
little
while
ago.
you
just
want
a
sure
source
of
payment
than
--
that
you
would
get
from
the
payee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
donovan.
mr.
washburn
--
chief
justice

you
