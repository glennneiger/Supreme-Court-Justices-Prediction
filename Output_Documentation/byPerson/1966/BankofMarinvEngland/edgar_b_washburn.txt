mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
the
sole
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
bank
which
honors
the
checks
of
a
depositor
is
to
be
held
responsible
to
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
or
the
depositor
if
the
bank
honored
the
checks
after
the
depositor
has
filed
a
voluntary
petition
in
bankruptcy
and
where
the
bank
had
no
notice
of
the
bankruptcy.
the
facts
of
this
matter
are
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
notice
and
no
knowledge.
the
facts
are
virtually
undisputed.
between
august
27th
and
september
17th
1963,
marin
seafoods
drew
and
delivered
five
checks
on
its
commercial
count
with
the
bank
of
marin.
these
checks
were
delivered
to
eureka
fisheries.
on
september
26th,
1963,
marin
seafoods
filed
a
voluntary
petition
of
bankruptcy
in
the
district
court.
four
days
later,
john
m.
england
was
appointed
receiver
and
on
october
20th,
1963,
he
became
the
trustee.
on
october
2nd,
1963,
the
checks
which
had
previously
been
drawn
and
delivered
were
presented
by
eureka
fisheries
to
the
bank
for
payment.
as
of
this
date,
the
bank
had
no
notice
and
no
knowledge
for
the
bankruptcy.
there
were
sufficient
funds
on
deposit.
the
bank
therefore
honored
the
checks.
subsequently,
the
trustee
applied
to
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
for
a
turnover
order.
the
referee
held
that
the
bank
and
the
payee
of
those
checks
were
jointly
responsible
to
the
trustee
for
the
amount
of
the
checks.
subsequently
the
payee
paid
the
judgment
and
has
now
sought
contribution
against
the
bank.
after
that
occurred
the
bank
petition
for
review
in
the
district
court
ultimately
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
held
that
the
lack
of
notice
afforded
no
protection
to
the
bank
because
of
the
wording
of
section
70a
and
70d
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
as
the
contention
of
the
petitioner,
bank
of
marin
that
the
application
of
these
two
sections
of
the
bankruptcy
act
by
the
court
of
the
appeals
violates
due
process
in
two
regards.
firstly,
it's
requiring
the
bank
who
had
previously
satisfied
its
obligation
to
its
depositor
to
satisfy
this
obligation
without
notice
a
second
time.
as
a
part
of
that
same
contention
is
the
second
question
is
that
the
bank
is
being
compelled
to
pay
the
same
debt
twice.
when
the
checks
were
originally
presented
for
payment
the
bank
was
discharging
its
legal
obligation
to
its
depositor
by
honoring
the
checks.
if
the
bank
is
to
be
compelled
to
satisfy
this
obligation
again
to
the
trustee,
we
contend
that
the
bank
is
in
fact
being
compelled
--
pay
twice.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
your
honor.
the
--
in
addition
to
our
constitutional
argument,
we
feel
that
the
bankruptcy
act
can
there
--
very
reasonably
be
construed
to
protect
the
bank
and
that
this
court
need
not
rule
on
the
constitution
argument.
we
feel
firstly
that
section
70d(5),
the
last
sentence
in
that
particular
section
which
provides
that
nothing
in
this
title
shall
impair
negotiability,
or
currency
or
negotiable
instruments.
we
feel
that
that
particular
provision
forged
the
bank
protection
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
there
is
very
little
that
we
could
find
that
informed
us
as
what
congress
specifically
intended
when
they
enacted
particular
provision.
i
think
that
reason
dictates
that
congress
must
have
had
in
mind
a
drawee
bank
when
their
particular
savings
cost
was
enacted.
the
drawee
bank
is
the
party
that
is
most
frequently
going
to
be
involved
in
the
negotiation
of
checks
or
in
the
cashing
of
checks
or
negotiable
instruments
when
bankruptcy
is
involved.
secondly
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
think
as
a
practical
manner
your
honor,
what
happened
was
that
prior
to
1959,
there
was
a
time
period
between
the
moment
of
the
filing
of
a
voluntary
petition
of
bankruptcy
in
between
--
in
the
ultimate
adjudication.
other
provision
to
section
70d
would
afford
protection
to
a
bank
during
that
particular
time
period.
in
1959,
the
act
was
amended
so
that
adjudication
became
automatic
upon
the
filing
of
a
voluntary
petition.
this
was
to
affect
more
as
a
procedural
change
to
relieve
the
district
court
judges
of
the
burden
of
having
to
pass
on
every
single
voluntary
petition.
but
it
did
have
the
effect
of
making
adjudication
automatic.
with
that
time
period
gone,
there
--
no
longer
was
any
time
between
bankruptcy
and
adjudication
during
which
the
banks
could
acquire
notice
and
in
the
past
as
a
practical
manner,
banks
did
get
notice.
the
trustee
would
phone
them
up.
they'd
receive
a
letter
and
in
fact
they
probably
would
have
gotten
notice
in
this
situation
such
as
this
where
ultimately
the
bank
did
get
notice
in
the
form
of
a
letter
from
the
trustee.
so
i
think
that
explains
the
reasons
for
the
lack
of
litigation
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes,
and
as
pointed
out
by
the
amicus
curie
in
this
particular
case,
since
this
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
bank
of
america
has
had
six
similar
incidents
and
the
bank
of
marin,
i
know
is,
has
had
one.
so
that
we
feel
that
there
is
significant
burden
that's
being
placed
on
the
banks
by
reasoning
of
this
particular
ruling.
referring
back
again
to
the
negotiability
proviso
of
section
70d(5),
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
drawee
bank
was
intended
to
be
protected.if
the
drawee
bank
is
not
protected,
there
is
virtually
no
one
who
is
going
to
be.
the
payee
of
a
check
generally
will
be
either
a
preferred
creditor
or
it
will
be
a
fraudulent
transfer
if
the
transfer
occurs
so
close
to
bankruptcy
that
the
checks
are
going
to
be
presented
afterwards.
certainly,
possibly
other
subsequent
holders
from
the
payee
might
be
able
to
for
protection.
but
the
two
people
that
are
most
intimately
involved
are
going
to
be
most
frequently
involved
would
be
the
payee
and
the
bank.
the
payee
as
i
mentioned
probably
won't
be
protected.
the
bank
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
be
protected.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
have
no
knowledge
one
way
or
the
other.
i
do
know
that
the
payee
has
informed
us,
they
fully
intend
to
pursue
their
contribution
action
against
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
possibly,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
particular
incident
--
incidence,
the
payee
here
was
a
trade
creditor
and
the
delivery
of
the
check
to
the
payee
was
a
preference.
and
although
this
was
not
the
basis
for
the
referee's
decision,
i
think
that
the
payee
would
have
to
return
the
funds
to
the
trustee
in
any
event.
so
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
for
protecting
the
bank
would
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
payee
would
be
left
off
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
would
say
in
that
instance
your
honor
the
payee
also
would
receive
protection.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
would
say
so
your
honor
although
there
is
--
i
think,
there
is
one
distinction,
banks
are
in
the
peculiar
situation
of
dealing
with
deposits,
dealing
with
vast
numbers
of
checks
everyday.
so
that
the
burden
that
is
placed
upon
a
bank
to
keep
itself
advised
is
to
whether
or
not
a
depositor,
any
given
depositor
has
gone
into
bankruptcy
is
virtually
impossible
whereas
an
individual
payee
who
is
receiving
a
check
from
one
person
could
conceivably
in
a
great
deal
easier
than
the
bank
find
out
whether
this
particular
person
was
the
subject
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
negotiability
proviso
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
i
also
appeal
that
the
bankruptcy
act
is
susceptible
to
affording
protection
to
the
bank
on
the
basis
of
equity.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
lower
courts
that
were
handed
prior
to
1938
have
no
application
here
because
section
70d
undertakes
to
set
forth
all
of
the
transactions
that
are
to
be
protected
after
the
filing
of
a
petition
of
bankruptcy.
the
court
of
appeals
also
noted
in
another
portion
of
their
opinion
that
section
70d
in
fact
has
no
application
to
a
voluntary
bankruptcy
because
section
70d
applies
only
in
the
interval
after
the
filing
of
a
voluntary
petition
and
before
adjudication
or
before
a
receiver
takes
possession.
in
the
situation
of
a
voluntary
petition,
there
is
no
such
interval
so
that
is
virtually
impossible
whether
there
ever
be
any
instance
when
section
70d
can
apply.
we
agree
with
that
particular
interpretation
of
section
70d
except
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
negotiability
proviso
of
section
70d(5).
that
proviso
i
think
on
its
phase
is
not
so
limited
in
that
it
says
that
nothing
in
this
title
shall
impair
instruments
or
currency.
and
by
this
title,
it's
referring
to
title
11
of
the
u.s.
code
which
is
the
bankruptcy
act
in
its
entirety.
so
we
feel
that
70(d)
in
that
particular
regard
is
not
limited.
however
as
to
the
other
provisions
of
section
70d,
it
is
our
position
that
they
have
virtually
no
application
in
a
sit
--
in
a
voluntary
bankruptcy.
there
is
therefore
no
specific
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act
dealing
with
what
transactions
are
to
receive
protection
after
the
filing
of
a
voluntary
petition.
this
stands
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
strictly
be
an
issue
between
the
trustee
and
the
payee.
there
are
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
basically
on
the
basis
of
california
law
which
provides
that
when
two
parties
are
held
jointly
responsible
to
a
third
and
one
pays
more
than
his
half
or
his
share,
the
one
paying
may
seek
contribution
for
the
case
of
two
parties,
the
other
half
from
the
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
however,
if
we
are
seeking
to
have
that
particular
judgment
reversed
because
of
the
fact,
we
don't
feel
that
the
bank
should
be
responsible
to
the
trustee
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
well,
i
don't
believe
that
there
would
be
a
problem
if
the
bank
were
not
jointly
liable.
there
would
be
no
contribution
claim.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
if
the
bank
is
jointly
liable,
no,
this
decision
is
not
going
to
affect
that.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
it
won't
preclude
it
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
don't
believe
it
will
preclude
it
from
asserting
the
defense
you
honor.
however,
i
don't
think
that
we
would
be
able
to
prevail
in
asserting
that
particular
defense.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no,
if
the
act
means
that
there
is
virtually
no
transfer
of
the
bankrupt's
property
with
or
without
notice
after
bankruptcy,
that's
valid
against
the
trustee.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
your
honor.
but
our
contention
is
this,
that
in
--
with
respect
to
a
person
in
the
position
of
a
bank
who
is
holding
the
--.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
they
have
to
have
notice
before
they
can
be
held
responsible.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
oh,
i
think
there
was
a
preference
because
the
checks
were
delivered
prior
to
bankruptcy.
there
were
--
the
checks
were
withdrawn
and
delivered
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
regardless
of
money
after
bankruptcy
when
the
bank
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no,
i
meant
to
make
this
clear
that
we
--
the
referee
did
not
base
his
decision
on
the
grounds
of
a
preference.
its
my
opinion
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
--
that
it
was
a
preference.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
it
would
be
my
opinion
that
he
could
since
the
checks
were
delivered
prior
to
bankruptcy.if
they've
been
delivered
afterwards
it
might
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
they'd
gone
through
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
well,
you
get
into
the
--
to
this
--
where
--
when
the
provisional
credit
was
given
on
the
payee's
account
with
his
bank
going
through
the
whole
collection
of
the
circle.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
record
does
not
reflect
when
all
of
these
various
transactions
took
place.
in
any
event
we
do
feel
that
the
inconsistencies
in
section
70d
in
effect
remove
any
specific
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act
in
the
case
of
a
voluntary
petition
with
respect
to
what
transactions
are
going
to
receive
protection.
this
places
the
act
in
essentially
the
same
postures
that
was
prior
to
1938
when
section
70d
was
originally
enacted.
as
of
that
date,
there
were
numerous
cases
which
protected
innocent
third
parties
dealing
with
the
bankrupt's
property
after
the
filing
of
a
petition.
there
were
also
a
substantial
number
of
cases
which
protected
banks.
and
we
would
urge
the
court
that
these
cases
can
be
considered
and
that
the
doctrine,
the
equitable
doctrines
that
were
put
forth
in
this
cases
are
our
basis
for
interpreting
the
act
in
the
position
favorable
to
the
bank.
the
specific
cases
dealing
with
banks
protected
the
bank
basically
because
it
was
virtually
impossible
for
the
bank
to
acquire
a
notice
of
the
bankruptcy.
it
was
purely
an
equitable
argument
that
--
it
was
stated
that
it
would
--
to
put
the
burden
on
the
bank
of
having
to
ascertain
whether
every
depositor
had
or
had
not
filed
a
petition
of
bankruptcy
prior
to
honoring
a
check
was
impossible
and
unreasonable.
and
therefore
protection
was
afforded.
i
admit
that
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
in
this
particular
law
suit?
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
payee
eventually
paid
the
trustee.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
payee
paid
the
trustee
with
the
amount
of
the
judgment
and
then
filed
a
notice
of
contribution
against
the
bank.
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
action
was
requested
to
file
a
brief
with
the
ninth
circuit
informing
it
of
what
its
intent
was
and
it
informed
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
intended
to
pursue
its
remedy
of
contribution
against
the
bank
but
that
it
was
withholding
further
proceedings
pending
resolution
of
this
particular
petition.
so
that
question
hasn't
been
resolved.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
presumably
the
interest
of
the
trustee
is
to
establish
a
holding
that
banks
are
going
to
be
held
responsible
in
this
type
of
situation.
in
this
particular
situation,
i
think
it's
obvious
that
from
purely
a
monetary
point
of
view,
the
trustee
probably
has
nothing
to
lose
other
than
whatever
cost
might
have
been
incurred.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
believe
so
your
honor.
we
feel
that
this
particular
controversy
as
to
the
bank
is
not
moot
in
any
respect
and
that
the
only
way
that
we
have
of
protecting
ourselves
is
to
contest
the
original
decision
imposing
liability
upon
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
well,
if
the
trust
--
i
don't
think
it's
an
abstract
as
far
as
the
bank
is
concern
that
we
are
the
one
that
petitioned.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
feel
that
this
is
the
only
way
that
we
can
review
the
particular
decision
which
--
has
imposed
liability
against
us.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
well,
we
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
trustee
has
resisted
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
because
your
honor
we
feel
that
under
--
in
california
law
that
the
judgment
holding
the
bank
--
jointly
responsible
with
the
payee
is
res
judicata
as
to
the
--
that
particular
issue.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
perhaps
we
would
be
back
starting
all
over
again.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
still
think
that
the
only
that
we
can
protect
ourselves
in
this
particular
instance
is
to
contest
the
original
jury,
the
original
judgment.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
have
no
knowledge
if
it
is
a
company,
i
think
it
is
doing
quite
well.
i
have
no
actual
knowledge
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
he
is
not,
but
the
bank
certainty
is.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
then
the
same
question
may
arrive
in
a
suit
against
the
bank
and
the
payee
whether
the
trustee
can
be
foreclosed
against
holding
the
bank
responsible.
in
other
words,
the
bank's
main
contention
is
that
you'd
never
be
held
responsible
to
the
trustee
in
the
first
instance.
now
i
doubt
whether
in
a
suit
against
the
payee
only
whether
the
bank
could
alter
the
judgment
holding
it
responsible
or
could
affect
the
trustee's
rights
against
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
in
the
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
would
certainly
have
a
--
a
certain
cost.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes
we
have.
there
is
a
monetary
interest
in
the
trustee
in
that
respect.
i
would
say
this
that
the
interest
of
the
trustee
is
probably
no
different
that
any
other
person
who
has
won
a
case,
has
collected
the
money
and
the
person
who
paid
is
--
has
been
--
sought
for
review.
and
as
long
as
the
petitioning
party
doesn't
pay
voluntarily,
this
court
has
held
that
it's
not
a
moot
question.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
didn't
but
i
think
that
the
fact
that
a
person
paid
and
then
seeks
contribution
from
you
should
not
preclude
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes
it
did.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
it
has
not.
the
judgment
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
under
california
law
the
judgment
is
not
discharged
if
the
trust
--
if
the
payee
asserts
contribution
in
that
particular
manner
in
which
the
payee
has
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
would
be
to
recover
half
--
the
money
that
the
payee
has
paid
from
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes,
but
the
judgment
does
survive.
in
fact
that
the
payee
paid
has
not
discharge
the
judgment.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we're
not
asking
you
to
make
that
decision
your
honor.
we
feel
that
that
will
be
--
would
be
resolved
if
the
bank
--
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
bank
was
not
properly
held
responsible
in
the
first
instance,
that
question
would
be
resolved.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
would
certainly
have
a
defense
to
it.
the
fact
to
it
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
--
(voice
overlap)
the
basis
(inaudible).
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
a
running
against
both.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
would
have
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
as
against
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
it
hasn't
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
it
is
of
course
the
payee's
concern.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i'm
not
sure
whether
he'd
be
liable
for
our
cause
in
this
particular
--
that
we
have
incurred
by
virtue
of
a
petition,
i
just
do
not
know.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
nothing.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes,
so
there
were
basis
of
the
contribution
suit
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
joint
judgment
running
against
both
the
payee
and
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
right,
as
long
as
the
joint
judgment.
but
even
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
there's
no
joint
judgment
and
no
right
of
contribution.
the
bank
would
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
nothing
would
happen.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
it
would
have
--
would
already
been
discharged
by
the
payment
to
the
trustee.
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
think
so
sir.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
think
from
the
questions
asked
by
the
court
to
mr.
donovan,
the
court
fully
understands
the
position
of
the
bank.
and
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
submit
it
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
the
sole
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
bank
which
honors
the
checks
of
a
depositor
is
to
be
held
responsible
to
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
or
the
depositor
if
the
bank
honored
the
checks
after
the
depositor
has
filed
a
voluntary
petition
in
bankruptcy
and
where
the
bank
had
no
notice
of
the
bankruptcy.
the
facts
of
this
matter
are
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
notice
and
no
knowledge.
the
facts
are
virtually
undisputed.
between
august
27th
and
september
17th
1963,
marin
seafoods
drew
and
delivered
five
checks
on
its
commercial
count
with
the
bank
of
marin.
these
checks
were
delivered
to
eureka
fisheries.
on
september
26th,
1963,
marin
seafoods
filed
a
voluntary
petition
of
bankruptcy
in
the
district
court.
four
days
later,
john
m.
england
was
appointed
receiver
and
on
october
20th,
1963,
he
became
the
trustee.
on
october
2nd,
1963,
the
checks
which
had
previously
been
drawn
and
delivered
were
presented
by
eureka
fisheries
to
the
bank
for
payment.
as
of
this
date,
the
bank
had
no
notice
and
no
knowledge
for
the
bankruptcy.
there
were
sufficient
funds
on
deposit.
the
bank
therefore
honored
the
checks.
subsequently,
the
trustee
applied
to
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
for
a
turnover
order.
the
referee
held
that
the
bank
and
the
payee
of
those
checks
were
jointly
responsible
to
the
trustee
for
the
amount
of
the
checks.
subsequently
the
payee
paid
the
judgment
and
has
now
sought
contribution
against
the
bank.
after
that
occurred
the
bank
petition
for
review
in
the
district
court
ultimately
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
held
that
the
lack
of
notice
afforded
no
protection
to
the
bank
because
of
the
wording
of
section
70a
and
70d
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
as
the
contention
of
the
petitioner,
bank
of
marin
that
the
application
of
these
two
sections
of
the
bankruptcy
act
by
the
court
of
the
appeals
violates
due
process
in
two
regards.
firstly,
it's
requiring
the
bank
who
had
previously
satisfied
its
obligation
to
its
depositor
to
satisfy
this
obligation
without
notice
a
second
time.
as
a
part
of
that
same
contention
is
the
second
question
is
that
the
bank
is
being
compelled
to
pay
the
same
debt
twice.
when
the
checks
were
originally
presented
for
payment
the
bank
was
discharging
its
legal
obligation
to
its
depositor
by
honoring
the
checks.
if
the
bank
is
to
be
compelled
to
satisfy
this
obligation
again
to
the
trustee,
we
contend
that
the
bank
is
in
fact
being
compelled
--
pay
twice.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
your
honor.
the
--
in
addition
to
our
constitutional
argument,
we
feel
that
the
bankruptcy
act
can
there
--
very
reasonably
be
construed
to
protect
the
bank
and
that
this
court
need
not
rule
on
the
constitution
argument.
we
feel
firstly
that
section
70d(5),
the
last
sentence
in
that
particular
section
which
provides
that
nothing
in
this
title
shall
impair
negotiability,
or
currency
or
negotiable
instruments.
we
feel
that
that
particular
provision
forged
the
bank
protection
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
there
is
very
little
that
we
could
find
that
informed
us
as
what
congress
specifically
intended
when
they
enacted
particular
provision.
i
think
that
reason
dictates
that
congress
must
have
had
in
mind
a
drawee
bank
when
their
particular
savings
cost
was
enacted.
the
drawee
bank
is
the
party
that
is
most
frequently
going
to
be
involved
in
the
negotiation
of
checks
or
in
the
cashing
of
checks
or
negotiable
instruments
when
bankruptcy
is
involved.
secondly
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
think
as
a
practical
manner
your
honor,
what
happened
was
that
prior
to
1959,
there
was
a
time
period
between
the
moment
of
the
filing
of
a
voluntary
petition
of
bankruptcy
in
between
--
in
the
ultimate
adjudication.
other
provision
to
section
70d
would
afford
protection
to
a
bank
during
that
particular
time
period.
in
1959,
the
act
was
amended
so
that
adjudication
became
automatic
upon
the
filing
of
a
voluntary
petition.
this
was
to
affect
more
as
a
procedural
change
to
relieve
the
district
court
judges
of
the
burden
of
having
to
pass
on
every
single
voluntary
petition.
but
it
did
have
the
effect
of
making
adjudication
automatic.
with
that
time
period
gone,
there
--
no
longer
was
any
time
between
bankruptcy
and
adjudication
during
which
the
banks
could
acquire
notice
and
in
the
past
as
a
practical
manner,
banks
did
get
notice.
the
trustee
would
phone
them
up.
they'd
receive
a
letter
and
in
fact
they
probably
would
have
gotten
notice
in
this
situation
such
as
this
where
ultimately
the
bank
did
get
notice
in
the
form
of
a
letter
from
the
trustee.
so
i
think
that
explains
the
reasons
for
the
lack
of
litigation
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes,
and
as
pointed
out
by
the
amicus
curie
in
this
particular
case,
since
this
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
bank
of
america
has
had
six
similar
incidents
and
the
bank
of
marin,
i
know
is,
has
had
one.
so
that
we
feel
that
there
is
significant
burden
that's
being
placed
on
the
banks
by
reasoning
of
this
particular
ruling.
referring
back
again
to
the
negotiability
proviso
of
section
70d(5),
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
drawee
bank
was
intended
to
be
protected.if
the
drawee
bank
is
not
protected,
there
is
virtually
no
one
who
is
going
to
be.
the
payee
of
a
check
generally
will
be
either
a
preferred
creditor
or
it
will
be
a
fraudulent
transfer
if
the
transfer
occurs
so
close
to
bankruptcy
that
the
checks
are
going
to
be
presented
afterwards.
certainly,
possibly
other
subsequent
holders
from
the
payee
might
be
able
to
for
protection.
but
the
two
people
that
are
most
intimately
involved
are
going
to
be
most
frequently
involved
would
be
the
payee
and
the
bank.
the
payee
as
i
mentioned
probably
won't
be
protected.
the
bank
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
be
protected.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
have
no
knowledge
one
way
or
the
other.
i
do
know
that
the
payee
has
informed
us,
they
fully
intend
to
pursue
their
contribution
action
against
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
possibly,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
particular
incident
--
incidence,
the
payee
here
was
a
trade
creditor
and
the
delivery
of
the
check
to
the
payee
was
a
preference.
and
although
this
was
not
the
basis
for
the
referee's
decision,
i
think
that
the
payee
would
have
to
return
the
funds
to
the
trustee
in
any
event.
so
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
for
protecting
the
bank
would
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
payee
would
be
left
off
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
would
say
in
that
instance
your
honor
the
payee
also
would
receive
protection.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
would
say
so
your
honor
although
there
is
--
i
think,
there
is
one
distinction,
banks
are
in
the
peculiar
situation
of
dealing
with
deposits,
dealing
with
vast
numbers
of
checks
everyday.
so
that
the
burden
that
is
placed
upon
a
bank
to
keep
itself
advised
is
to
whether
or
not
a
depositor,
any
given
depositor
has
gone
into
bankruptcy
is
virtually
impossible
whereas
an
individual
payee
who
is
receiving
a
check
from
one
person
could
conceivably
in
a
great
deal
easier
than
the
bank
find
out
whether
this
particular
person
was
the
subject
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
negotiability
proviso
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
i
also
appeal
that
the
bankruptcy
act
is
susceptible
to
affording
protection
to
the
bank
on
the
basis
of
equity.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
lower
courts
that
were
handed
prior
to
1938
have
no
application
here
because
section
70d
undertakes
to
set
forth
all
of
the
transactions
that
are
to
be
protected
after
the
filing
of
a
petition
of
bankruptcy.
the
court
of
appeals
also
noted
in
another
portion
of
their
opinion
that
section
70d
in
fact
has
no
application
to
a
voluntary
bankruptcy
because
section
70d
applies
only
in
the
interval
after
the
filing
of
a
voluntary
petition
and
before
adjudication
or
before
a
receiver
takes
possession.
in
the
situation
of
a
voluntary
petition,
there
is
no
such
interval
so
that
is
virtually
impossible
whether
there
ever
be
any
instance
when
section
70d
can
apply.
we
agree
with
that
particular
interpretation
of
section
70d
except
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
negotiability
proviso
of
section
70d(5).
that
proviso
i
think
on
its
phase
is
not
so
limited
in
that
it
says
that
nothing
in
this
title
shall
impair
instruments
or
currency.
and
by
this
title,
it's
referring
to
title
11
of
the
u.s.
code
which
is
the
bankruptcy
act
in
its
entirety.
so
we
feel
that
70(d)
in
that
particular
regard
is
not
limited.
however
as
to
the
other
provisions
of
section
70d,
it
is
our
position
that
they
have
virtually
no
application
in
a
sit
--
in
a
voluntary
bankruptcy.
there
is
therefore
no
specific
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act
dealing
with
what
transactions
are
to
receive
protection
after
the
filing
of
a
voluntary
petition.
this
stands
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
strictly
be
an
issue
between
the
trustee
and
the
payee.
there
are
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
basically
on
the
basis
of
california
law
which
provides
that
when
two
parties
are
held
jointly
responsible
to
a
third
and
one
pays
more
than
his
half
or
his
share,
the
one
paying
may
seek
contribution
for
the
case
of
two
parties,
the
other
half
from
the
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
however,
if
we
are
seeking
to
have
that
particular
judgment
reversed
because
of
the
fact,
we
don't
feel
that
the
bank
should
be
responsible
to
the
trustee
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
well,
i
don't
believe
that
there
would
be
a
problem
if
the
bank
were
not
jointly
liable.
there
would
be
no
contribution
claim.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
if
the
bank
is
jointly
liable,
no,
this
decision
is
not
going
to
affect
that.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
it
won't
preclude
it
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
don't
believe
it
will
preclude
it
from
asserting
the
defense
you
honor.
however,
i
don't
think
that
we
would
be
able
to
prevail
in
asserting
that
particular
defense.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no,
if
the
act
means
that
there
is
virtually
no
transfer
of
the
bankrupt's
property
with
or
without
notice
after
bankruptcy,
that's
valid
against
the
trustee.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
your
honor.
but
our
contention
is
this,
that
in
--
with
respect
to
a
person
in
the
position
of
a
bank
who
is
holding
the
--.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
they
have
to
have
notice
before
they
can
be
held
responsible.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
oh,
i
think
there
was
a
preference
because
the
checks
were
delivered
prior
to
bankruptcy.
there
were
--
the
checks
were
withdrawn
and
delivered
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
regardless
of
money
after
bankruptcy
when
the
bank
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no,
i
meant
to
make
this
clear
that
we
--
the
referee
did
not
base
his
decision
on
the
grounds
of
a
preference.
its
my
opinion
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
--
that
it
was
a
preference.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
it
would
be
my
opinion
that
he
could
since
the
checks
were
delivered
prior
to
bankruptcy.if
they've
been
delivered
afterwards
it
might
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
they'd
gone
through
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
well,
you
get
into
the
--
to
this
--
where
--
when
the
provisional
credit
was
given
on
the
payee's
account
with
his
bank
going
through
the
whole
collection
of
the
circle.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
record
does
not
reflect
when
all
of
these
various
transactions
took
place.
in
any
event
we
do
feel
that
the
inconsistencies
in
section
70d
in
effect
remove
any
specific
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act
in
the
case
of
a
voluntary
petition
with
respect
to
what
transactions
are
going
to
receive
protection.
this
places
the
act
in
essentially
the
same
postures
that
was
prior
to
1938
when
section
70d
was
originally
enacted.
as
of
that
date,
there
were
numerous
cases
which
protected
innocent
third
parties
dealing
with
the
bankrupt's
property
after
the
filing
of
a
petition.
there
were
also
a
substantial
number
of
cases
which
protected
banks.
and
we
would
urge
the
court
that
these
cases
can
be
considered
and
that
the
doctrine,
the
equitable
doctrines
that
were
put
forth
in
this
cases
are
our
basis
for
interpreting
the
act
in
the
position
favorable
to
the
bank.
the
specific
cases
dealing
with
banks
protected
the
bank
basically
because
it
was
virtually
impossible
for
the
bank
to
acquire
a
notice
of
the
bankruptcy.
it
was
purely
an
equitable
argument
that
--
it
was
stated
that
it
would
--
to
put
the
burden
on
the
bank
of
having
to
ascertain
whether
every
depositor
had
or
had
not
filed
a
petition
of
bankruptcy
prior
to
honoring
a
check
was
impossible
and
unreasonable.
and
therefore
protection
was
afforded.
i
admit
that
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
in
this
particular
law
suit?
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
payee
eventually
paid
the
trustee.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
payee
paid
the
trustee
with
the
amount
of
the
judgment
and
then
filed
a
notice
of
contribution
against
the
bank.
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
action
was
requested
to
file
a
brief
with
the
ninth
circuit
informing
it
of
what
its
intent
was
and
it
informed
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
intended
to
pursue
its
remedy
of
contribution
against
the
bank
but
that
it
was
withholding
further
proceedings
pending
resolution
of
this
particular
petition.
so
that
question
hasn't
been
resolved.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
presumably
the
interest
of
the
trustee
is
to
establish
a
holding
that
banks
are
going
to
be
held
responsible
in
this
type
of
situation.
in
this
particular
situation,
i
think
it's
obvious
that
from
purely
a
monetary
point
of
view,
the
trustee
probably
has
nothing
to
lose
other
than
whatever
cost
might
have
been
incurred.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
believe
so
your
honor.
we
feel
that
this
particular
controversy
as
to
the
bank
is
not
moot
in
any
respect
and
that
the
only
way
that
we
have
of
protecting
ourselves
is
to
contest
the
original
decision
imposing
liability
upon
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
well,
if
the
trust
--
i
don't
think
it's
an
abstract
as
far
as
the
bank
is
concern
that
we
are
the
one
that
petitioned.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
feel
that
this
is
the
only
way
that
we
can
review
the
particular
decision
which
--
has
imposed
liability
against
us.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
well,
we
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
the
trustee
has
resisted
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
because
your
honor
we
feel
that
under
--
in
california
law
that
the
judgment
holding
the
bank
--
jointly
responsible
with
the
payee
is
res
judicata
as
to
the
--
that
particular
issue.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
perhaps
we
would
be
back
starting
all
over
again.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
still
think
that
the
only
that
we
can
protect
ourselves
in
this
particular
instance
is
to
contest
the
original
jury,
the
original
judgment.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
have
no
knowledge
if
it
is
a
company,
i
think
it
is
doing
quite
well.
i
have
no
actual
knowledge
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
he
is
not,
but
the
bank
certainty
is.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
then
the
same
question
may
arrive
in
a
suit
against
the
bank
and
the
payee
whether
the
trustee
can
be
foreclosed
against
holding
the
bank
responsible.
in
other
words,
the
bank's
main
contention
is
that
you'd
never
be
held
responsible
to
the
trustee
in
the
first
instance.
now
i
doubt
whether
in
a
suit
against
the
payee
only
whether
the
bank
could
alter
the
judgment
holding
it
responsible
or
could
affect
the
trustee's
rights
against
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
in
the
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
would
certainly
have
a
--
a
certain
cost.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes
we
have.
there
is
a
monetary
interest
in
the
trustee
in
that
respect.
i
would
say
this
that
the
interest
of
the
trustee
is
probably
no
different
that
any
other
person
who
has
won
a
case,
has
collected
the
money
and
the
person
who
paid
is
--
has
been
--
sought
for
review.
and
as
long
as
the
petitioning
party
doesn't
pay
voluntarily,
this
court
has
held
that
it's
not
a
moot
question.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
didn't
but
i
think
that
the
fact
that
a
person
paid
and
then
seeks
contribution
from
you
should
not
preclude
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes
it
did.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
it
has
not.
the
judgment
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
but
under
california
law
the
judgment
is
not
discharged
if
the
trust
--
if
the
payee
asserts
contribution
in
that
particular
manner
in
which
the
payee
has
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
would
be
to
recover
half
--
the
money
that
the
payee
has
paid
from
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes,
but
the
judgment
does
survive.
in
fact
that
the
payee
paid
has
not
discharge
the
judgment.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we're
not
asking
you
to
make
that
decision
your
honor.
we
feel
that
that
will
be
--
would
be
resolved
if
the
bank
--
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
bank
was
not
properly
held
responsible
in
the
first
instance,
that
question
would
be
resolved.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
would
certainly
have
a
defense
to
it.
the
fact
to
it
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
--
(voice
overlap)
the
basis
(inaudible).
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
a
running
against
both.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
we
would
have
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
as
against
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
no
it
hasn't
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
it
is
of
course
the
payee's
concern.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i'm
not
sure
whether
he'd
be
liable
for
our
cause
in
this
particular
--
that
we
have
incurred
by
virtue
of
a
petition,
i
just
do
not
know.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
nothing.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes,
so
there
were
basis
of
the
contribution
suit
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
joint
judgment
running
against
both
the
payee
and
the
bank.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
yes.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
right,
as
long
as
the
joint
judgment.
but
even
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
there's
no
joint
judgment
and
no
right
of
contribution.
the
bank
would
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
nothing
would
happen.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
it
would
have
--
would
already
been
discharged
by
the
payment
to
the
trustee.
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
think
so
sir.
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edgar
b.
washburn
i
think
from
the
questions
asked
by
the
court
to
mr.
donovan,
the
court
fully
understands
the
position
of
the
bank.
and
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
submit
it
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
