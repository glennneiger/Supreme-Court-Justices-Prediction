mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
the
questions
that
were
asked.
i
think
that
first
one
that
i
should
respond
to
is
the
question
of
contribution
under
california
law.
i
would
take
issue
with
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
in
which
he
cites
a
number
of
cases
which
set
forth
the
existence
of
a
right
to
contribution
in
favor
of
a
joint
obligor
under
a
judgment
who
has
satisfied
the
judgment
against
other
obligors
on
the
judgment
who
have
not
paid
any
share
of
the
judgment
to
the
cases
or
the
cases
universally
set
forth
the
proposition
is
that
the
person
seeking
contribution
is
entitled
to
recover
from
the
nonpaying
obligor
his
proportionate
share.
they
don't
say
one
half
or
a
fractional
share
equal
to
the
number
of
parties
involved
in
the
case.
they
say
his
proportionate
share.
and
two
the
case
cited
by
the
petitioner,
davis
against
heimbach
involved
a
case
where
execution
was
issued
without
any
showing
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
paying
judgment
obligor
seeking
contribution.
it
simply
applied
to
the
court
for
a
writ
of
execution
and
it
was
granted.
that
was
reversed
on
the
ground
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing.
there
has
to
be
a
notice
and
opportunity
for
a
hearing
before
contribution
can
be
issued
against
the
nonpaying
joint
obligor
on
a
judgment.
a
second
case
illustrates
this
equally
well,
this
was
starz
(ph)
against
fletcher
where
after
a
hearing
the
court
issued
a
execution
in
favor
of
the
party
seeking
contribution
against
the
nonpaying
party.
but
the
order
contained
no
finding,
no
basis
for
a
judicial
conclusion
that
a
contribution
was
required.
and
again
the
appellate
court
found
that
you
have
to
make
some
positive
showing
as
to
what
the
proportionate
share
of
the
nonpaying
joint
obligor
on
the
judgment
is.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
i
am
here
your
honor
for
two
reasons,
one
as
an
officer
of
this
court
and
as
an
officer
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
we
began
these
proceedings
by
filing
an
application
for
turnover
order
against
the
bank
of
marin
and
against
the
eureka
fisheries.
when
we
discovered
the
facts
to
be
as
they
were
the
money
of
the
bankrupt
estate
had
been
paid
out
after
bankruptcy
we
examined
the
situation
and
found
these
two
potential
parties
responsible.
in
our
view
we
filed
an
application
and
it
resulted
in
the
judgment
that
is
now
being
reviewed
and
we
feel
an
obligation
to
continue
through
to
the
end
even
though
we've
already
received
a
full
payment
from
eureka
fisheries
to
see
this
case
through
to
the
end.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
that's
the
second
half
of
it
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
is
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
i
do
not
believe
sir,
your
honor
for
this
reason
i
agree
100%
with
the
court
that
there
is
nothing
that
we
can
gain
by
your
decision
in
this
case.
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
as
far
as
the
trustee
is
concerned
except
insofar
we
are
responsible
for
cause
in
a
hearing
before
this
court.
i
agree
with
the
petitioner
however
that
this
is
the
only
place
he
can
seek
review.
he
has
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
i'm
simply
accepting
his
position
as
far
as
this
--
your
question
goes.
if
this
court
does
not
rule
on
this
question,
the
judgment
holding
the
petitioner
jointly
liable
to
the
trustee
becomes
final
and
that
judgment
cannot
be
reviewed
in
any
other
court.
now
if
that
happened,
the
eureka
--
now
speaking
hypothetically,
eureka
fisheries
would
file
either
an
action
or
an
application
--
a
notice
or
motion
for
the
writ
--
for
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
execution
by
a
virtue
of
the
california
law
of
contribution.
in
that
proceeding
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
that
doesn't
bother
me
a
bit.
that
that
is
--
that's
why
i
say
it's
immaterial
as
far
as
we're
concern.
what
does
concern
me
though
is
this,
if
this
court
--
it
would
not
concern
me
if
this
court
failed
to
rule.
but
if
this
court
did
rule,
it
would
concern
me
very
much
if
we
didn't
do
the
utmost
to
protect
trustee's
position
in
this
in
this
case.
because
i
believe
the
issue
involved
here
is
of
fundamental
importance
in
the
administration
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
that
question
is
not
here,
the
question
is
whether
we
can
go
after
the
bank
because
then
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
if
the
bank
is
liable
under
the
statute
we
do
not
want
our
right
as
attorneys
for
trustees
to
be
precluded.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
bank
is
a
better
defendant
in
any
lawsuit
as
far
as
solvency
goes
than
most
other
defendants.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
that
is
not
what
i
said.
a
bank
by
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor,
but
it
might
very
well
come
up
in
a
situation
where
the
--
for
example
in
this
case
we
had
four
people
that
we
could
have
pursued.
we
could
have
pursued
the
bank
--
marin
seafoods,
the
bankrupt
itself
but
that
was
a
corporation
and
a
corporation
after
bankruptcy
isn't
a
very
attractive
defendant.
we
could
have
sued
the
officer
of
the
marin
seafoods
who
actually
went
out
and
collected
this
receivables,
took
them
down,
deposit
it
and
--
and
deposited
them
in
the
bank
of
marin
after
bankruptcy
and
then
we
could
have
gone
after
him
because
this
was
a
fraud
on
the
estate.
we
could
have
gone
after
eureka
fisheries
but
again
there's
a
corporation
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
bank's
cause
of
action
against
the
payee
mr.
justice
white
is
for
--
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it's
paid
out
money
under
a
mistake
of
fact.
the
payee
as
a
result
has
been
unjustly
enriched
because
this
--
at
the
time
the
money
was
paid
out
by
the
bank
these
were
assets
not
of
the
bankrupt
or
not
of
the
bank
or
not
of
the
payee
but
these
were
assets
of
a
bankrupt
estate.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
now
this
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
your
honor
you've
led
me
into
the
answer
to
your
question
which
you
had
asked
my
opponent,
wasn't
this
a
preference
of
the
--
this
question
is
not
involved
here.
the
law
however
is
that
when
a
check
is
delivered
in
payment
of
goods,
even
though
the
checks
may
not
be
presented
for
several
weeks
or
days,
it
is
not
a
preference.
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it's
a
--
it
is
considered
a
cash
payment.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
unless
--
that's
right,
that's
right.
he
might
be
able
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
you
see
--
that
again
is
not
this
case
your
honor,
this
case
--
there
was
no
money
in
the
bank
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
this
is
precisely
why
i
believe
that
the
section
70d(5)
provides
that
nothing
in
this
act
shall
impair
the
negotiability
of
currency
or
negotiable
instrument.
now
the
payee
in
the
situation
that
you've
described,
is
let's
say
a
holder
of
a
negotiable
instrument.
he
has
no
notice
of
any
defense
and
he
is
holder
in
due
course
and
here
there
is
an
intervening
act,
bankruptcy.
the
question
is,
what
are
his
rights?
are
they
determined
under
bankruptcy
law?
are
they
determined
under
the
law
of
negotiable
instruments?
and
we've
got
an
--
a
conflict
here.
there
are
two
very
complex
systems
of
law
at
work,
one,
bankruptcy,
the
other,
the
law
of
negotiable
instrument.
the
law
in
this
case
i
believe
although
i
have
with
my
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
payee
would
be
a
holder
in
due
course
and
he
would
have
--
he
may
be
--
also
the
recipient
of
a
preference,
he
may
not
be,
that
we
do
not
know
but
if
he
is,
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
back
under
the
bankruptcy
law
even
though
under
negotiable
instrument
law
he's
a
holder
in
due
course
if
he
is
not
the
recipient
of
a
preference.
let's
assume
he
is
not
the
recipient
of
a
preference
then
he
prevails
because
the
transfer
was
not
a
preference
under
the
bankruptcy
law.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
bank
has
to
pay
for
this
reason
your
honor
because
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy
these
assets
if
we
may
speculate
about
what
happened
here
and
i
think
we
have
to.
these
assets
were
not
in
the
bank.
they
were
not
in
the
hands
of
the
payee.
they
were
not
in
the
hands
of
the
bankrupt.
they
were
in
the
hands
of
parties
unknown
who
owed
money
to
the
bankrupt.
after
bankruptcy
the
bankrupt
went
out
to
his
creditors
fraudulently
told
them,
"i
am
here
on
behalf
of
marin
seafoods."
he
failed
to
disclose
to
them
that
marin
seafoods
was
now
a
bankrupt.
he
said,
"you
owe
me
$2300.
pay
me."
they
paid.
he
took
the
proceeds
and
he
deposited
them
after
bankruptcy
in
the
bank
of
marin.
so
these
funds
came
into
the
bank
after
bankruptcy.
and
is
the
statute
is
quite
clear
that
no
transfer
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy
shall
be
valid
against
the
trustee.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
i
would
make
the
same
argument,
yes.
because
the
law
covers
both
aspects
but
if
it
was
a
deposit
before
bankruptcy
i
think
we
might
get
into
questions
under
70c
which
are
not
presented.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
precisely.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
to
go
off
the
record
again
sir,
the
bank
or
we
don't
have
to
go
off
the
record,
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
on
oct
--
september
30th,
1963,
john
england
was
appointed
as
receiver
and
at
that
time
examined
the
record
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
he
determined
that
there
was
a
bank
account
in
the
bank
of
marin
and
he
sent
a
notice
dated
october
2nd
to
the
bank
of
marin.
and
you'll
notice
that
october
2nd
is
the
day
that
the
bank
paid
out
to
eureka
fisheries
$2300.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
now,
on
october
3rd,
the
bank
received
the
notice
from
mr.
england
and
notwithstanding
it
had
notice
of
the
bankruptcy,
it
continued
to
honor
checks
against
this
account
to
the
tune
of
$700.
so
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
the
bank
has
paid
that
part
of
the
judgment.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
court
of
appeals
asked
us
same
question
on
argument
and
it
asked
for
further
briefs
on
that
particular
question.
it
ultimately
ended
up
ruling
without
deciding
this
collateral
question
of
contribution
and
it
decided
the
case
on
the
issue
as
it
had
been
presented
in
our
original
briefs.
now,
i
believe
what
would
happen
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
eureka
fisheries
would
bring
or
pursue
its
action
for
contribution
against
the
bank
of
marin
and
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
is
not
liable.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well
this
would
be
very
serious.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
not
--
it
would
not
be
serious
--
i
didn't
mean
to
be
funny.
it
would
not
have
any
bearing
on
the
trustee
in
this
particular
case.
it
would
have
a
tremendous
bearing
on
bankruptcy
cases
dealing
not
only
with
bank
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
because
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
the
rights
of
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it
would
be
--
it
would
release
a
person
who
holds
assets
of
a
bankrupt
estates
from
accountability
to
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
--
and
thereby
impair
the
rights
of
creditors
generally.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
until
he
has
notice,
that
is
right.
now
perhaps
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
perhaps
the
answer
--
i
can
answer
your
question
but
it
will
take
a
little
while
and
perhaps
i
should
i
do
so.
prior
to
1938,
section
70a
of
the
bankruptcy
act
provided
that
as
of
the
date
of
adjudication,
the
trustee
shall
be
vested
with
title
to
the
bankrupt
assets.
now
this
rule,
this
statutory
rule
that
has
been
on
the
books
for
many
years
resulted
in
two
difficulties
both
of
which
the
court
attempted
to
deal
with.
number
one,
there
was
this
difficulty,
bankruptcy
normally
means
that
as
of
the
date
of
a
filing
of
a
bankruptcy
petition,
the
bankrupt
is
dead
as
far
as
its
assets
go.
he
has
--
he
is
able
to
begin
a
new
life
free
from
his
obligation,
the
proceeded
bankrupt
in
large
part.
he
has
a
fixed
cutoff
date
for
this.
now
in
return,
his
creditor's
rights
are
fixed
as
of
the
date
he
files
his
petition
and
if
he
has
assets
of
whatever
kind
but
are
not
exempt
then
those
creditors
have
rights
which
are
determined
under
the
bankruptcy
act
to
a
ratable
distribution
of
all
the
bankrupt's
pre-bankruptcy
assets.
this
gets
into
the
law
of
preference
and
the
law
of
fraudulent
conveyances
and
it
gets
into
the
laws
of
exemptions
but
notwithstanding
that
the
bankrupt
is
free
as
of
that
date
from
certain
of
his
obligations,
his
creditor's
rights
are
established
as
of
that
date
to
a
certain
of
his
asset.
now
this
privilege
date
is
a
fund
--
as
fundamental
to
bankruptcy
law
as
the
date
of
debtors
to
probate
while
you
just
have
to
have
a
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
that's
right
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
there
are
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
they
are
all
the
bank's
creditors.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
that
is
not
right.
it
is
not
under
the
obligation,
it
is
under
an
obligation
to
pay
the
many
to
the
trustee.
the
bank,
it
--
its
paying
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
now
the
conclusion
that
the
bank
is
obligated
to
pay
the
money
is
based
on
the
premise
that
the
bankrupt
who
deposit
the
money
there
has
a
power
to
draw
against
the
--
or
the
right
to
draw
against
that
account
on
an
order.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
that
right
ceased
as
of
the
moment
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
if
the
(inaudible)
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
because
of
the
different
development
of
70
--
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
now
as
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
this
court
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
i
believe
so
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
it's
related
again
to
this
case.
number
one,
it
does
appear
on
the
record
that
the
trustee
sent
a
notice.
the
ref
--
the
receiver
sent
a
notice
on
october
2nd
which
was
received
and
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
because
he
was
concerned
that
these
assets
were
in
the
bank
and
might
be
disbursed.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
bank
normally
would
get
its
notice
from
the
receiver
but
that's
not
because
of
any
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no
and
that
is
exactly
why
the
notice
requirement
is
so
difficult
because
if
the
bank
was
free
to
do
as
it
thought
proper
with
this
assets
regardless
of
bankruptcy
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
then
these
rights
that
are
established
as
of
the
date
of
the
bankruptcy
remained
in
limbo
until
he
receives
notice.
and
that
notice
might
come
in
a
day.
it
might
come
with
a
phone
call
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
not
necessarily.
in
this
case,
the
trustee
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
i
can't
speak
from
personal
knowledge
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
so.
i
believe
there
is
some
gap.
in
this
case
the
trustee
was
appointed
on
october
30th.
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
that
--
because
we
had
a
receiver
probably.
and
the
notice
on
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
--
the
first
meeting
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
again
mr.
chief
justice,
my
personal
experience
in
this
area
is
so
limited
that
i
hesitate
to
tell
you
because
i'm
so
uncertain
of
my
own
background.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
--
i
would
say
that
the
normal
human
reaction
when
one
learns
that
one
has
asset
or
one
is
a
fiduciary
and
one
board
has
assets
is
to
reduce
those
assets
to
possession
and
control.
and
that
simply
what
the
receiver
is
doing
here.
he
is
not
filing
a
notice
because
it's
necessary
to
establish
his
right.
he
is
doing
so
as
a
practical
matter
to
eliminate
the
confusion
that's
going
to
result
when
he
does
try
to
reduce
these
assets
to
possession.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it's
a
very
difficult
question.
congress
has
considered
this
question
and
its
solution
has
been
section
70d
and
if
it
--
came
up
with
a
different
solution.
if
it
said
the
bank
is
entitled
to
pay
until
it
receives
notice
of
bankruptcy,
then
you've
protected
banks
but
on
the
other
hand
you've
left
all
the
creditors
unprotected.
you've
left
the
receiver
unprotected.
until
he
can
actually
find
out
who
has
the
assets
and
communicate
word
notice
of
the
bankruptcy
from
himself
to
the
person
in
possession.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
the
bank
does
not
pay
the
same
obligation
twice.
that's
why
this
is
not
a
(inaudible)
case
a
harris
case
or
a
western
--
the
pennsylvania
western
union
case
because
the
bank
--
the
first
time
it
paid
was
paying
under
a
mistake
of
fact.
in
fact,
it
had
no
right
to
pay
pursuant
to
the
drawer's
order.
it
had
only
the
right
to
pay
to
the
trustee.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
this
is
the
cost
of
banking,
yes.
the
bank
also
has
a
remedy
against
third
parties.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
the
--
it
may
have
your
honor,
but
congress
--
number
one,
we're
dealing
with
the
statutory
rule
here
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrate
very
clearly
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
rights
of
these
two
groups
of
people,
innocent
third
parties
dealing
after
bankruptcy
and
i'm
the
first
to
admit
that
they
are
innocent
acting
in
good
faith.
but
it's
also
concerned
with
the
rights
of
the
creditors
of
the
bankrupt
who
after
all
who
--
rights
to
collect
that
money
is
being
discharge
in
many
cases.
and
it's
protecting
their
right
to
a
ratable
share
of
the
bankrupt's
assets.
now,
when
congress
wrote
this
role,
petitioner
suggested
that
you
have
to
imply
notice
to
give
--
to
protect
the
bank
in
this
situation
and
he
suggest
it
perhaps
constitutionally
you
have
to
imply
notice.
well,
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
imply
notice
to
section
70d,
you
render
the
section
completely
meaningless
because
the
whole
crux
of
the
section
is
that
good
parties
dealing
after
bankruptcy
with
the
assets
of
bankrupt
estate
are
protected
only
until
adjudication
or
until
a
receiver
takes
possession
and
here
we
have
adjudication
before
the
transfer.
if
notice
could
be
implied
why
then
did
congress
write
in
section
70d
(3)
which
says
that
in
any
case
when
a
party
has
actual
notice,
its
shall
always
be
deemed
not
to
be
acting
in
good
faith.
congress
knew
--
thought
about
this
good
faith
part,
it
thought
about
the
lack
of
notice
and
it
decided
notwithstanding
that
that
the
policy
in
favor
of
preserving
intact
assets
of
bankrupt
estates
at
a
date
which
could
be
manageably
administered
without
a
great
deal
of
litigation
and
discussion
and
factual
examination
of
when
one
party
receive
notice
and
when
another
party
receive
note.
it
decided
that
you
have
to
have
a
firm
cut
update
except
in
the
limited
circumstances
where
there
is
a
transfer
after
bankruptcy
but
before
adjudication.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it
would
contribute
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
if
we
lose
this
case
your
honor,
we
would
be
--
the
trustee
generally
would
be
subject
to
a
new
area
of
fraud
that
now
is
precluded.
this
was
--
we
got
in
here
to
the
massey
decision
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
a
decision
of
this
court
in
1904
which
does
not
deal
with
an
issue
before
this
court.
but
after
that
decision
was
rendered,
james
mclaughlin
who
wrote
the
chandler
act
in
the
same
article
in
the
chicago
law
review
which
i
have
referred
to
in
my
brief,
some,
they
criticized
that
decision
because
of
this
very
factor
that
it
contributes
to
fraud.
it
leaves
open
an
area
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
because
its
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
it
means
instead
of
having
a
firm
cutoff
date,
instead
of
having
an
established
date
to
which
the
trustee
and
courts
can
refer.
you
have
a
flexible
date
that
depends
partly
on
the
facts
given
to
the
receiver
of
the
trustee
by
third
parties
partly
on
his
ability
to
communicate
if
in
this
interim
period
there
is
an
opportunity
for
disposition
of
the
assets
does
not
exist
if
you
have
a
firm
rule
that
no
transfers
after
bankruptcy
are
valid.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
in
part
of
this
mr.
justice
stewart
and
part
of
it
does
not.
for
the
checks
were
drawn
and
delivered
to
the
payee
prior
to
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
as
far
as
we
know
the
checks
were
worthless
at
that
time
and
the
only
thing
that
made
them
worth
the
paper
they
are
written
on
was
the
fact
that
after
bankruptcy
the
bankrupt
collected
accounts
receivable
and
deposited
the
proceeds
in
his
bank
account.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
we
don't
know,
but
this
is
a
possibility.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor
except
also
in
this
respect,
to
get
into
the
question
of
fraudulent
conveyances
and
here
we're
not
concern
with
the
good
faith
or
lack
of
good
faith
or
the
fraudulent
intent
of
the
party
against
liability
is
asserted
but
we're
simple
concerned
with
the
fact
that
here
where
assets
of
a
bankrupt
estate
which
were
transferred
after
bankruptcy
and
under
section
70,
the
language
is
crystal
clear
that
no
transfer
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy
shall
be
valid
against
the
trustee.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
that's
the
particular
transfer
where
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
that
also
is
such
a
transfer
in
this
case,
it
--
it's
not
an
issue
now
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
it
would
not
be
considered
a
preference
because
it
did
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
as
far
as
the
third
party
is
concern,
it
might
or
might
not
be
a
preference
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
fact
we'll
conceive
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
if
it
was
a
preference
though,
a
whole
different
set
of
rules
are
involved.
all
preferences
are
automatically
invalid,
you
have
to
show
that
at
the
time
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well
because
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
because
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
one
thing
we
may
not
have
been
able
to
find
the
payee.
if
we
found
him,
he
may
have
disposed
of
the
assets.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
he
might
not
have
been
accountable.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
we
--
certainly,
we
want
banks
to
be
accountable
on
this
circumstances.
but
more
than
that,
we
want
a
--
we
want
to
execute
congress'
intent
that
the
date
of
cleavage
in
bankruptcy
is
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
and
that
if
any
exemptions
from
that
rule
are
going
to
be
granted
then
they
ought
to
be
granted
by
congress.
in
this
case
congress
has
expressly
recognized
this
precise
problem
and
it
has
established
by
law
a
statute
which
says
that
parties
dealing
in
good
faith
after
bankruptcy
are
protected
only
until
adjudication
or
only
until
the
receiver
takes
possession.
and
if
i
may
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
all
i
can
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
professor
mclaughlin
in
his
chicago
law
review
article
and
in
his
testimony
before
the
house
subcommittee
points
out
that
mr.
chandler,
the
namesake
of
the
bill
was
skilled
in
bankruptcy
and
had
contributed
immeasurably
to
the
enactment
of
this
legislation.
but
i
don't
think
he
meant
and
i
am
not
sure
it
is
not
so
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
only
testimony,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
representative
of
the
national
bankers
association,
i
believed
his
name
was
mr.
styris
(ph)
testified
just
prior
to
mr.
justice
douglas
who
testified
at
great
length
on
the
corporate
reorganization
provisions
of
the
chandler
act.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
styris
only
comment
and
it
was
very
brief,
said
that
he
was
pleased
that
the
drafters
of
the
chandler
act
had
established
and
preserved
the
banker's
right
of
set
off
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
there
has
nothing
whatsoever
with
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
there
were
a
--
there
was
literally
scores
of
cases
involved
in
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it
had
--
it
didn't
have
any
specific
answer
to
that
question.
it
did
have
--
professor
mclaughlin's
testimony
which
explored
the
historical
background
which
induced
the
drafters
to
insert
section
70d
in
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
the
questions
that
were
asked.
i
think
that
first
one
that
i
should
respond
to
is
the
question
of
contribution
under
california
law.
i
would
take
issue
with
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
in
which
he
cites
a
number
of
cases
which
set
forth
the
existence
of
a
right
to
contribution
in
favor
of
a
joint
obligor
under
a
judgment
who
has
satisfied
the
judgment
against
other
obligors
on
the
judgment
who
have
not
paid
any
share
of
the
judgment
to
the
cases
or
the
cases
universally
set
forth
the
proposition
is
that
the
person
seeking
contribution
is
entitled
to
recover
from
the
nonpaying
obligor
his
proportionate
share.
they
don't
say
one
half
or
a
fractional
share
equal
to
the
number
of
parties
involved
in
the
case.
they
say
his
proportionate
share.
and
two
the
case
cited
by
the
petitioner,
davis
against
heimbach
involved
a
case
where
execution
was
issued
without
any
showing
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
paying
judgment
obligor
seeking
contribution.
it
simply
applied
to
the
court
for
a
writ
of
execution
and
it
was
granted.
that
was
reversed
on
the
ground
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing.
there
has
to
be
a
notice
and
opportunity
for
a
hearing
before
contribution
can
be
issued
against
the
nonpaying
joint
obligor
on
a
judgment.
a
second
case
illustrates
this
equally
well,
this
was
starz
(ph)
against
fletcher
where
after
a
hearing
the
court
issued
a
execution
in
favor
of
the
party
seeking
contribution
against
the
nonpaying
party.
but
the
order
contained
no
finding,
no
basis
for
a
judicial
conclusion
that
a
contribution
was
required.
and
again
the
appellate
court
found
that
you
have
to
make
some
positive
showing
as
to
what
the
proportionate
share
of
the
nonpaying
joint
obligor
on
the
judgment
is.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
i
am
here
your
honor
for
two
reasons,
one
as
an
officer
of
this
court
and
as
an
officer
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
we
began
these
proceedings
by
filing
an
application
for
turnover
order
against
the
bank
of
marin
and
against
the
eureka
fisheries.
when
we
discovered
the
facts
to
be
as
they
were
the
money
of
the
bankrupt
estate
had
been
paid
out
after
bankruptcy
we
examined
the
situation
and
found
these
two
potential
parties
responsible.
in
our
view
we
filed
an
application
and
it
resulted
in
the
judgment
that
is
now
being
reviewed
and
we
feel
an
obligation
to
continue
through
to
the
end
even
though
we've
already
received
a
full
payment
from
eureka
fisheries
to
see
this
case
through
to
the
end.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
that's
the
second
half
of
it
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
is
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
i
do
not
believe
sir,
your
honor
for
this
reason
i
agree
100%
with
the
court
that
there
is
nothing
that
we
can
gain
by
your
decision
in
this
case.
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
as
far
as
the
trustee
is
concerned
except
insofar
we
are
responsible
for
cause
in
a
hearing
before
this
court.
i
agree
with
the
petitioner
however
that
this
is
the
only
place
he
can
seek
review.
he
has
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
i'm
simply
accepting
his
position
as
far
as
this
--
your
question
goes.
if
this
court
does
not
rule
on
this
question,
the
judgment
holding
the
petitioner
jointly
liable
to
the
trustee
becomes
final
and
that
judgment
cannot
be
reviewed
in
any
other
court.
now
if
that
happened,
the
eureka
--
now
speaking
hypothetically,
eureka
fisheries
would
file
either
an
action
or
an
application
--
a
notice
or
motion
for
the
writ
--
for
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
execution
by
a
virtue
of
the
california
law
of
contribution.
in
that
proceeding
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
that
doesn't
bother
me
a
bit.
that
that
is
--
that's
why
i
say
it's
immaterial
as
far
as
we're
concern.
what
does
concern
me
though
is
this,
if
this
court
--
it
would
not
concern
me
if
this
court
failed
to
rule.
but
if
this
court
did
rule,
it
would
concern
me
very
much
if
we
didn't
do
the
utmost
to
protect
trustee's
position
in
this
in
this
case.
because
i
believe
the
issue
involved
here
is
of
fundamental
importance
in
the
administration
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
that
question
is
not
here,
the
question
is
whether
we
can
go
after
the
bank
because
then
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
if
the
bank
is
liable
under
the
statute
we
do
not
want
our
right
as
attorneys
for
trustees
to
be
precluded.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
bank
is
a
better
defendant
in
any
lawsuit
as
far
as
solvency
goes
than
most
other
defendants.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
that
is
not
what
i
said.
a
bank
by
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor,
but
it
might
very
well
come
up
in
a
situation
where
the
--
for
example
in
this
case
we
had
four
people
that
we
could
have
pursued.
we
could
have
pursued
the
bank
--
marin
seafoods,
the
bankrupt
itself
but
that
was
a
corporation
and
a
corporation
after
bankruptcy
isn't
a
very
attractive
defendant.
we
could
have
sued
the
officer
of
the
marin
seafoods
who
actually
went
out
and
collected
this
receivables,
took
them
down,
deposit
it
and
--
and
deposited
them
in
the
bank
of
marin
after
bankruptcy
and
then
we
could
have
gone
after
him
because
this
was
a
fraud
on
the
estate.
we
could
have
gone
after
eureka
fisheries
but
again
there's
a
corporation
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
bank's
cause
of
action
against
the
payee
mr.
justice
white
is
for
--
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it's
paid
out
money
under
a
mistake
of
fact.
the
payee
as
a
result
has
been
unjustly
enriched
because
this
--
at
the
time
the
money
was
paid
out
by
the
bank
these
were
assets
not
of
the
bankrupt
or
not
of
the
bank
or
not
of
the
payee
but
these
were
assets
of
a
bankrupt
estate.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
now
this
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
your
honor
you've
led
me
into
the
answer
to
your
question
which
you
had
asked
my
opponent,
wasn't
this
a
preference
of
the
--
this
question
is
not
involved
here.
the
law
however
is
that
when
a
check
is
delivered
in
payment
of
goods,
even
though
the
checks
may
not
be
presented
for
several
weeks
or
days,
it
is
not
a
preference.
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it's
a
--
it
is
considered
a
cash
payment.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
unless
--
that's
right,
that's
right.
he
might
be
able
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
you
see
--
that
again
is
not
this
case
your
honor,
this
case
--
there
was
no
money
in
the
bank
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
this
is
precisely
why
i
believe
that
the
section
70d(5)
provides
that
nothing
in
this
act
shall
impair
the
negotiability
of
currency
or
negotiable
instrument.
now
the
payee
in
the
situation
that
you've
described,
is
let's
say
a
holder
of
a
negotiable
instrument.
he
has
no
notice
of
any
defense
and
he
is
holder
in
due
course
and
here
there
is
an
intervening
act,
bankruptcy.
the
question
is,
what
are
his
rights?
are
they
determined
under
bankruptcy
law?
are
they
determined
under
the
law
of
negotiable
instruments?
and
we've
got
an
--
a
conflict
here.
there
are
two
very
complex
systems
of
law
at
work,
one,
bankruptcy,
the
other,
the
law
of
negotiable
instrument.
the
law
in
this
case
i
believe
although
i
have
with
my
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
payee
would
be
a
holder
in
due
course
and
he
would
have
--
he
may
be
--
also
the
recipient
of
a
preference,
he
may
not
be,
that
we
do
not
know
but
if
he
is,
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
back
under
the
bankruptcy
law
even
though
under
negotiable
instrument
law
he's
a
holder
in
due
course
if
he
is
not
the
recipient
of
a
preference.
let's
assume
he
is
not
the
recipient
of
a
preference
then
he
prevails
because
the
transfer
was
not
a
preference
under
the
bankruptcy
law.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
bank
has
to
pay
for
this
reason
your
honor
because
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy
these
assets
if
we
may
speculate
about
what
happened
here
and
i
think
we
have
to.
these
assets
were
not
in
the
bank.
they
were
not
in
the
hands
of
the
payee.
they
were
not
in
the
hands
of
the
bankrupt.
they
were
in
the
hands
of
parties
unknown
who
owed
money
to
the
bankrupt.
after
bankruptcy
the
bankrupt
went
out
to
his
creditors
fraudulently
told
them,
"i
am
here
on
behalf
of
marin
seafoods."
he
failed
to
disclose
to
them
that
marin
seafoods
was
now
a
bankrupt.
he
said,
"you
owe
me
$2300.
pay
me."
they
paid.
he
took
the
proceeds
and
he
deposited
them
after
bankruptcy
in
the
bank
of
marin.
so
these
funds
came
into
the
bank
after
bankruptcy.
and
is
the
statute
is
quite
clear
that
no
transfer
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy
shall
be
valid
against
the
trustee.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
i
would
make
the
same
argument,
yes.
because
the
law
covers
both
aspects
but
if
it
was
a
deposit
before
bankruptcy
i
think
we
might
get
into
questions
under
70c
which
are
not
presented.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
precisely.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
to
go
off
the
record
again
sir,
the
bank
or
we
don't
have
to
go
off
the
record,
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
on
oct
--
september
30th,
1963,
john
england
was
appointed
as
receiver
and
at
that
time
examined
the
record
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
he
determined
that
there
was
a
bank
account
in
the
bank
of
marin
and
he
sent
a
notice
dated
october
2nd
to
the
bank
of
marin.
and
you'll
notice
that
october
2nd
is
the
day
that
the
bank
paid
out
to
eureka
fisheries
$2300.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
now,
on
october
3rd,
the
bank
received
the
notice
from
mr.
england
and
notwithstanding
it
had
notice
of
the
bankruptcy,
it
continued
to
honor
checks
against
this
account
to
the
tune
of
$700.
so
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
the
bank
has
paid
that
part
of
the
judgment.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
court
of
appeals
asked
us
same
question
on
argument
and
it
asked
for
further
briefs
on
that
particular
question.
it
ultimately
ended
up
ruling
without
deciding
this
collateral
question
of
contribution
and
it
decided
the
case
on
the
issue
as
it
had
been
presented
in
our
original
briefs.
now,
i
believe
what
would
happen
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
eureka
fisheries
would
bring
or
pursue
its
action
for
contribution
against
the
bank
of
marin
and
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
is
not
liable.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well
this
would
be
very
serious.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
not
--
it
would
not
be
serious
--
i
didn't
mean
to
be
funny.
it
would
not
have
any
bearing
on
the
trustee
in
this
particular
case.
it
would
have
a
tremendous
bearing
on
bankruptcy
cases
dealing
not
only
with
bank
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes.
because
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
the
rights
of
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it
would
be
--
it
would
release
a
person
who
holds
assets
of
a
bankrupt
estates
from
accountability
to
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
--
and
thereby
impair
the
rights
of
creditors
generally.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
until
he
has
notice,
that
is
right.
now
perhaps
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
perhaps
the
answer
--
i
can
answer
your
question
but
it
will
take
a
little
while
and
perhaps
i
should
i
do
so.
prior
to
1938,
section
70a
of
the
bankruptcy
act
provided
that
as
of
the
date
of
adjudication,
the
trustee
shall
be
vested
with
title
to
the
bankrupt
assets.
now
this
rule,
this
statutory
rule
that
has
been
on
the
books
for
many
years
resulted
in
two
difficulties
both
of
which
the
court
attempted
to
deal
with.
number
one,
there
was
this
difficulty,
bankruptcy
normally
means
that
as
of
the
date
of
a
filing
of
a
bankruptcy
petition,
the
bankrupt
is
dead
as
far
as
its
assets
go.
he
has
--
he
is
able
to
begin
a
new
life
free
from
his
obligation,
the
proceeded
bankrupt
in
large
part.
he
has
a
fixed
cutoff
date
for
this.
now
in
return,
his
creditor's
rights
are
fixed
as
of
the
date
he
files
his
petition
and
if
he
has
assets
of
whatever
kind
but
are
not
exempt
then
those
creditors
have
rights
which
are
determined
under
the
bankruptcy
act
to
a
ratable
distribution
of
all
the
bankrupt's
pre-bankruptcy
assets.
this
gets
into
the
law
of
preference
and
the
law
of
fraudulent
conveyances
and
it
gets
into
the
laws
of
exemptions
but
notwithstanding
that
the
bankrupt
is
free
as
of
that
date
from
certain
of
his
obligations,
his
creditor's
rights
are
established
as
of
that
date
to
a
certain
of
his
asset.
now
this
privilege
date
is
a
fund
--
as
fundamental
to
bankruptcy
law
as
the
date
of
debtors
to
probate
while
you
just
have
to
have
a
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
that's
right
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
there
are
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
they
are
all
the
bank's
creditors.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
that
is
not
right.
it
is
not
under
the
obligation,
it
is
under
an
obligation
to
pay
the
many
to
the
trustee.
the
bank,
it
--
its
paying
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
now
the
conclusion
that
the
bank
is
obligated
to
pay
the
money
is
based
on
the
premise
that
the
bankrupt
who
deposit
the
money
there
has
a
power
to
draw
against
the
--
or
the
right
to
draw
against
that
account
on
an
order.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
that
right
ceased
as
of
the
moment
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
if
the
(inaudible)
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
because
of
the
different
development
of
70
--
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
now
as
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
this
court
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
i
believe
so
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
it's
related
again
to
this
case.
number
one,
it
does
appear
on
the
record
that
the
trustee
sent
a
notice.
the
ref
--
the
receiver
sent
a
notice
on
october
2nd
which
was
received
and
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
because
he
was
concerned
that
these
assets
were
in
the
bank
and
might
be
disbursed.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
bank
normally
would
get
its
notice
from
the
receiver
but
that's
not
because
of
any
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no
and
that
is
exactly
why
the
notice
requirement
is
so
difficult
because
if
the
bank
was
free
to
do
as
it
thought
proper
with
this
assets
regardless
of
bankruptcy
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
then
these
rights
that
are
established
as
of
the
date
of
the
bankruptcy
remained
in
limbo
until
he
receives
notice.
and
that
notice
might
come
in
a
day.
it
might
come
with
a
phone
call
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
not
necessarily.
in
this
case,
the
trustee
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
i
can't
speak
from
personal
knowledge
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
so.
i
believe
there
is
some
gap.
in
this
case
the
trustee
was
appointed
on
october
30th.
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
that
--
because
we
had
a
receiver
probably.
and
the
notice
on
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
--
the
first
meeting
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
again
mr.
chief
justice,
my
personal
experience
in
this
area
is
so
limited
that
i
hesitate
to
tell
you
because
i'm
so
uncertain
of
my
own
background.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
--
i
would
say
that
the
normal
human
reaction
when
one
learns
that
one
has
asset
or
one
is
a
fiduciary
and
one
board
has
assets
is
to
reduce
those
assets
to
possession
and
control.
and
that
simply
what
the
receiver
is
doing
here.
he
is
not
filing
a
notice
because
it's
necessary
to
establish
his
right.
he
is
doing
so
as
a
practical
matter
to
eliminate
the
confusion
that's
going
to
result
when
he
does
try
to
reduce
these
assets
to
possession.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it's
a
very
difficult
question.
congress
has
considered
this
question
and
its
solution
has
been
section
70d
and
if
it
--
came
up
with
a
different
solution.
if
it
said
the
bank
is
entitled
to
pay
until
it
receives
notice
of
bankruptcy,
then
you've
protected
banks
but
on
the
other
hand
you've
left
all
the
creditors
unprotected.
you've
left
the
receiver
unprotected.
until
he
can
actually
find
out
who
has
the
assets
and
communicate
word
notice
of
the
bankruptcy
from
himself
to
the
person
in
possession.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
the
bank
does
not
pay
the
same
obligation
twice.
that's
why
this
is
not
a
(inaudible)
case
a
harris
case
or
a
western
--
the
pennsylvania
western
union
case
because
the
bank
--
the
first
time
it
paid
was
paying
under
a
mistake
of
fact.
in
fact,
it
had
no
right
to
pay
pursuant
to
the
drawer's
order.
it
had
only
the
right
to
pay
to
the
trustee.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
this
is
the
cost
of
banking,
yes.
the
bank
also
has
a
remedy
against
third
parties.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
the
--
it
may
have
your
honor,
but
congress
--
number
one,
we're
dealing
with
the
statutory
rule
here
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrate
very
clearly
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
rights
of
these
two
groups
of
people,
innocent
third
parties
dealing
after
bankruptcy
and
i'm
the
first
to
admit
that
they
are
innocent
acting
in
good
faith.
but
it's
also
concerned
with
the
rights
of
the
creditors
of
the
bankrupt
who
after
all
who
--
rights
to
collect
that
money
is
being
discharge
in
many
cases.
and
it's
protecting
their
right
to
a
ratable
share
of
the
bankrupt's
assets.
now,
when
congress
wrote
this
role,
petitioner
suggested
that
you
have
to
imply
notice
to
give
--
to
protect
the
bank
in
this
situation
and
he
suggest
it
perhaps
constitutionally
you
have
to
imply
notice.
well,
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
imply
notice
to
section
70d,
you
render
the
section
completely
meaningless
because
the
whole
crux
of
the
section
is
that
good
parties
dealing
after
bankruptcy
with
the
assets
of
bankrupt
estate
are
protected
only
until
adjudication
or
until
a
receiver
takes
possession
and
here
we
have
adjudication
before
the
transfer.
if
notice
could
be
implied
why
then
did
congress
write
in
section
70d
(3)
which
says
that
in
any
case
when
a
party
has
actual
notice,
its
shall
always
be
deemed
not
to
be
acting
in
good
faith.
congress
knew
--
thought
about
this
good
faith
part,
it
thought
about
the
lack
of
notice
and
it
decided
notwithstanding
that
that
the
policy
in
favor
of
preserving
intact
assets
of
bankrupt
estates
at
a
date
which
could
be
manageably
administered
without
a
great
deal
of
litigation
and
discussion
and
factual
examination
of
when
one
party
receive
notice
and
when
another
party
receive
note.
it
decided
that
you
have
to
have
a
firm
cut
update
except
in
the
limited
circumstances
where
there
is
a
transfer
after
bankruptcy
but
before
adjudication.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it
would
contribute
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
if
we
lose
this
case
your
honor,
we
would
be
--
the
trustee
generally
would
be
subject
to
a
new
area
of
fraud
that
now
is
precluded.
this
was
--
we
got
in
here
to
the
massey
decision
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
a
decision
of
this
court
in
1904
which
does
not
deal
with
an
issue
before
this
court.
but
after
that
decision
was
rendered,
james
mclaughlin
who
wrote
the
chandler
act
in
the
same
article
in
the
chicago
law
review
which
i
have
referred
to
in
my
brief,
some,
they
criticized
that
decision
because
of
this
very
factor
that
it
contributes
to
fraud.
it
leaves
open
an
area
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
because
its
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no,
it
means
instead
of
having
a
firm
cutoff
date,
instead
of
having
an
established
date
to
which
the
trustee
and
courts
can
refer.
you
have
a
flexible
date
that
depends
partly
on
the
facts
given
to
the
receiver
of
the
trustee
by
third
parties
partly
on
his
ability
to
communicate
if
in
this
interim
period
there
is
an
opportunity
for
disposition
of
the
assets
does
not
exist
if
you
have
a
firm
rule
that
no
transfers
after
bankruptcy
are
valid.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
in
part
of
this
mr.
justice
stewart
and
part
of
it
does
not.
for
the
checks
were
drawn
and
delivered
to
the
payee
prior
to
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
as
far
as
we
know
the
checks
were
worthless
at
that
time
and
the
only
thing
that
made
them
worth
the
paper
they
are
written
on
was
the
fact
that
after
bankruptcy
the
bankrupt
collected
accounts
receivable
and
deposited
the
proceeds
in
his
bank
account.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
we
don't
know,
but
this
is
a
possibility.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor
except
also
in
this
respect,
to
get
into
the
question
of
fraudulent
conveyances
and
here
we're
not
concern
with
the
good
faith
or
lack
of
good
faith
or
the
fraudulent
intent
of
the
party
against
liability
is
asserted
but
we're
simple
concerned
with
the
fact
that
here
where
assets
of
a
bankrupt
estate
which
were
transferred
after
bankruptcy
and
under
section
70,
the
language
is
crystal
clear
that
no
transfer
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy
shall
be
valid
against
the
trustee.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
that's
the
particular
transfer
where
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
that
also
is
such
a
transfer
in
this
case,
it
--
it's
not
an
issue
now
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
no.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes,
it
would
not
be
considered
a
preference
because
it
did
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
as
far
as
the
third
party
is
concern,
it
might
or
might
not
be
a
preference
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
fact
we'll
conceive
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well,
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
if
it
was
a
preference
though,
a
whole
different
set
of
rules
are
involved.
all
preferences
are
automatically
invalid,
you
have
to
show
that
at
the
time
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
well
because
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
because
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
one
thing
we
may
not
have
been
able
to
find
the
payee.
if
we
found
him,
he
may
have
disposed
of
the
assets.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
he
might
not
have
been
accountable.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
we
--
certainly,
we
want
banks
to
be
accountable
on
this
circumstances.
but
more
than
that,
we
want
a
--
we
want
to
execute
congress'
intent
that
the
date
of
cleavage
in
bankruptcy
is
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
and
that
if
any
exemptions
from
that
rule
are
going
to
be
granted
then
they
ought
to
be
granted
by
congress.
in
this
case
congress
has
expressly
recognized
this
precise
problem
and
it
has
established
by
law
a
statute
which
says
that
parties
dealing
in
good
faith
after
bankruptcy
are
protected
only
until
adjudication
or
only
until
the
receiver
takes
possession.
and
if
i
may
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
all
i
can
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
professor
mclaughlin
in
his
chicago
law
review
article
and
in
his
testimony
before
the
house
subcommittee
points
out
that
mr.
chandler,
the
namesake
of
the
bill
was
skilled
in
bankruptcy
and
had
contributed
immeasurably
to
the
enactment
of
this
legislation.
but
i
don't
think
he
meant
and
i
am
not
sure
it
is
not
so
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
the
only
testimony,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
representative
of
the
national
bankers
association,
i
believed
his
name
was
mr.
styris
(ph)
testified
just
prior
to
mr.
justice
douglas
who
testified
at
great
length
on
the
corporate
reorganization
provisions
of
the
chandler
act.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
styris
only
comment
and
it
was
very
brief,
said
that
he
was
pleased
that
the
drafters
of
the
chandler
act
had
established
and
preserved
the
banker's
right
of
set
off
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
there
has
nothing
whatsoever
with
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
but
there
were
a
--
there
was
literally
scores
of
cases
involved
in
--
mr.
thomas
b.
donovan
it
had
--
it
didn't
have
any
specific
answer
to
that
question.
it
did
have
--
professor
mclaughlin's
testimony
which
explored
the
historical
background
which
induced
the
drafters
to
insert
section
70d
in
the
bankruptcy
act.
