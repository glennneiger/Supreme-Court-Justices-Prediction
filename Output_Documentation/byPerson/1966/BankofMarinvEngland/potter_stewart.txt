justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
you
say
strikes
me
as
correct,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
--
that's
the
reason
i'm
surprised
that
there
has
not
been
a
lot
more
case
law
development
of
this
question,
do
you
have
any
suggestions
to
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
donovan
in
this
case
all
these
checks
were
drawn
on
the
bank
and
delivered
to
the
payee
prior
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there
is
or
could
validly
be
any
distinction
between
this
kind
of
a
case
and
the
case
where
checks
were
fraudulently
drawn
and
delivered
after
bankruptcy
because
after
bankruptcy
the
bankrupt
himself
wouldn't
have
or
any
of
its
officers,
if
corporation
wouldn't
have
any
power
to
draw
checks,
only
the
trustee
would
have,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
didn't
--
i
missed
that
in
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
rule
would
be
the
same.
the
rule
for
which
you're
can
tend
would
be
the
same
even
if
those
facts
weren't
in
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
the
transfer
divided
by
the
bankrupt
estate
to
the
bank
of
the
fund.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
the
transfer
that's
an
issue
here,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
here
is
the
honoring
of
the
checks
by
the
bank
which
had
no
knowledge
of
the
bankruptcy.
