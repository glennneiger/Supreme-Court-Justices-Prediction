mr.
wright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
professor
wright,
do
you
properly
concede
the
purpose
of
my
question
and
the
reason
i
asked
the
question
was
because
mr.
zeldes
had
said
this
case
is
no
different
from
a
statute
that
would
require
burglars
to
register.
and
i
wanted
to
differentiate
between
a
burglary
statute
and
one
of
this
kind.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
the
difference
between
the
two
is
this,
that
--
and
nobody
recognizes
burglary
as
being
lawful
under
any
circumstances.
on
the
other
hand,
gambling
can
be
legal
or
it
can
be
illegal.
in
some
states,
gambling
is
legal
and
in
some
states
--
one
state
at
least,
practically
all
gambling
is
legal
but
others
permit
the
bingo
game
and
other
things
that
the
--
that
the
start
--
start
in
small
campus
but
eventually
developed
into
a
very
big
gambling
industries.
some
gambling,
the
united
states
is
interested
in
because
it
engages
in
commerce
and
as
to
that
has
a
vital
interest.
so
taking
it
by
and
large,
it
seems
to
me
that
gambling
is
one
of
those
--
one
of
those
industries
that
can
be
legal
or
can
be
illegal
but
its
been
recognized
as
a
kind
of
business
that
where
it
is
made
legal
even,
it
can
be
regulated
to
the
extent
of
extinction.
and
i
think
that
has
been
recognized
in
the
law
for
a
long
time.
now,
if
that
is
true
and
if
it
can
be
recognized
that
the
government
has
great
difficulty
in
collecting
taxes
from
ordinary
taxes
from
the
gambling
interest
because
of
the
surreptitious
ways
and
the
way
they
do
business.
is
there
any
reason
why
the
government
cannot
have
special
statutes
directed
to
an
industry
of
that
kind?
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
very
much
the
same
as
the
securities
business.
for
instance,
there
are
some
people
who
don't
deal
in
anything
legal
when
they
sell
security.
they
just
set
up
a
bucket
shop
and
a
--
and
a
teleformic
way
of
doing
business
and
operate
for
a
while
and
get
out
of
it.
there
are
others
of
course,
that
are
fairly
legal
and
some
people
who
normally
are
legal
cheat
on
it.
and
i
think
in
those
circumstances,
perhaps
the
government
could
be
entitled
to
have
a
registration
statute
for
--
for
all
security
dealers
and
so
i
just
ask
a
question
if
there
is
a
similarity
between
that
kind
of
an
industry
and
the
gambling
industry?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
--
just
if
i
may
interrupt
you
just
once.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
any
state
recognize
the
possession
as
being
legal,
the
possession
of
stolen
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah.
well,
that's
--
that's
the
basis
of
the
distinction
i
was
trying
to
get
at,
as
to
whether
this
business
which
can
be
legal
or
illegal
and
is
in
fact,
legal
in
some
places,
illegal
in
others,
doesn't
that
distinguish
it
from
that
kind
of
a
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
professor,
what
is
the
difference
between
what
the
government
suggests
on
the
one
hand,
and
are
exclusionary
rules
in
the
search
and
seizure
cases
and
also
the
fruit
of
poison
tree
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
might
be
a
difference
in
degree
there.
but
what
i
was
speaking
out
was
on
the
question
of
separation
of
powers.
if
we
could
hold
judicially
that
without
legislation
that
such
evidence
that
was
wrongfully
seized,
could
not
be
used
in
the
trial
of
case
and
if
we
held
that
the
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
doctrine
was
proper,
why
wouldn't
the
doctrine
that
the
government
suggests
be
proper?
in
this
case,
isn't
it
very
much
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
professor
wright,
we've
taken
so
much
of
your
time
and
any
questions
that
i'm
going
to
give
you
until
adjournment
time
at
12
o'clock.
chief
justice
earl
warren
professor,
do
you
--
do
you
recall
from
the
record
how
many
days
it
took
to
try
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
six
weeks,
it
was
a
long
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
recess
now.
mr.
mclaughlin,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mclaughlin
i
imagine
during
probation
days,
we
have
an
excise
tax
on
the
manufacturer
of
liquor,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
over
very
little
liquor
manufactured
except
by
the
--
the
moonshiners
was
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
don't
think
many
of
them
paid
the
tax,
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
oh!
yes,
--
i
doubted
very
many
of
them
paid,
paid
the
tax.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
have
--
no,
no.
no,
no,
i'm
not
suggesting.
i'm
suggesting
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
this
is
comparable
to
this
situation
on
whether
the
government
takes
in
a
lot
of
money
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
if
it
would
do
it
in
that
area
and
not
make
much
money
on
it
for
tax
purposes,
i
would
think
that
you
do
the
same
thing
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
bookmaking
on
the
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it's
not
the
only
state
that
does
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
continue
until
a
quarter
after.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
thank
you
counsel.
a
little
more
time,
you
may
have
some
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
very
well.

grosso
versus

united

mr.
wright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
beytagh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
your
position,
i
take
it
is
that
gambling
is
a
business
which
can
or
cannot
be
regulated
by
government.
it
can
be
permitted.
it
can
be
prohibited.
therefore,
it
would
come
within
the
taxing
power
to
tax
that
business
in
a
reason
--
in
any
reasonable
manner.
but
that
the
government
would
not
have
to
write
constitutionally
to
use
the
taxing
power
to
give
anyone
a
license
to
steal.
chief
