mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
commence
by
pointing
out
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
previous
case
which
the
court
heard
because
i
think
there
is
a
very
relevant
difference.
there
are
at
least
four
federal
crimes
connected
with
the
tax
area.
there
is
first
of
all,
failure
to
register
and
that's
not
applicable
in
the
income
tax
area
but
it
is
of
course
applicable
with
many
excise
taxes
including
the
tax
here
in
question.
there
are
three
other
crimes
which
apply
i
believe
equally
to
the
income
tax
area
and
virtually
all
federal
taxes.
they
are
willful
failure
to
file
a
return,
willful
failure
to
disclose
required
information
on
that
return,
and
finally,
a
third
discreet
crime,
willful
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
now,
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
the
third
of
those
three
crimes,
willful
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
in
other
words,
this
court
need
not
decide
in
this
case
whether
petitioner
could
have
been
convicted
for
willfully
failing
to
file
a
730
return.
a
copy
of
which
is
in
the
record
that
is
a
return
that
states
on
the
top
gambling
excise
tax.
this
court
need
not
decide
whether
if
he
had
filed
either
that
return
or
some
other
return,
whether
he
could
be
convicted
for
a
willfully
failing
to
disclose
required
information
on
that
return.
the
only
question
involved
here,
is
willful
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
it
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
holds
that
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax
and
i
should
assume
he
doesn't
have
to
-
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
in
order
to
reach
that
you've
found
that
he
doesn't
have
to
get
this.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
to
reach
the
third
question,
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
first
two.
now
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes.
there
are
a
large
number
of
other
statutes,
many
of
them
described
in
our
brief
in
the
introductory
portion
of
our
briefs
in
these
two
cases.
they
include
for
example,
one
--
one
example
is
the
liquor
area.
if
you
want
to
go
into
the
distilling
business,
you
must
register.
all
the
big
distillers
of
course
register.
if
you
want
to
become
a
wholesaler
of
liquor,
you
must
register.
and
there
are
taxes
then
imposed
on
the
distillation
of
liquor
that
raise
substantial
sums
of
money
and
many
other
federal
excise
taxes
are
administered
the
same
way.
this
is
not
an
unusual
aspect.
but
i'm
not
here
dealing
of
course,
as
justice
fortas
has
pointed
out
with
the
registration
provision.
this
court
could,
could
hold
for
the
petitioner
in
the
marchetti
case.
i
don't
--
i
urge
you
not
to
but
this
court
could
hold
for
the
petitioner
in
the
marchetti
case
and
yet
hold
that
a
person
is
not
excused
from
paying
a
tax
because
his
business
is
illegal.
and
that
same
question
is
applicable,
i
think,
not
merely
to
the
gambling
tax
but
to
a
host
of
other
taxes.
and
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
point
that
out.
there
are
of
course
two
principal
federal
taxes.
there
are
the
excise
taxes
and
there
is
the
income
statement
gift
tax
group.
now,
the
excise
tax
doesn't
consist
of
one
tax,
a
gambling
tax.
there
were
until
recently
with
an
excise
tax
reduction
over
a
year
ago.
hundreds
of
excise
taxes
all
going
to
make
up
a
single
package.
there
were
excise
taxes
imposed
on
a
very
large
number
and
are
traditionally
held
then
some
of
them
dating
back
into
the
nineteenth
century
and
many
of
them
dating
from
at
least
the
1930s
and
early
40s
and
a
very
large
number
of
luxury
or
non-essential
goods.
but
--
just
examples
would
be
radios,
television
sets,
jewelry,
furs,
liquors,
cigarettes,
sporting
goods,
cameras,
cabaret
taxes,
private
club
dues,
safe
deposit
boxes,
playing
cards,
bowling
alleys,
pool
tables,
the
gambling
tax
is
not
at
all
unusual
in
that
regard.
when
congress
considered
the
gambling
tax,
they
discussed
this
aspect
of
it.
and
how
did
the
legislative
history
reads
something
like
this,
commercialized
gambling
holds
the
unique
position
of
being
a
multibillion
dollar
nationwide
business
that
is
remained
comparatively
free
from
taxation
by
either
state
or
federal
governments.
this
relative
immunity
from
taxation
has
persisted
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
wagering
has
many
characteristics
which
make
it
particularly
suitable
as
a
subject
for
taxation.
your
committee
is
convinced
that
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
present
need
for
increased
revenue.
this
was
the
korean
war
days.
especially,
at
a
time
when
many
consumer
items
of
a
semi-necessary
nature
are
being
called
upon
to
bear
new
or
additional
tax
burdens.
at
the
same
time,
the
rates
on
things
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
1951,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
at
the
same
period,
taxes
ranged
as
high
as
30%
of
the
gross
sales
price
on
many
items.
subsequently
reduced
to
20%
and
now
many
of
the
taxes
have
been
repealed.
we
don't
know
whether
temporarily
or
permanently
in
light
of
new
revenue
needs.
but
taxes
range
as
high
as
20%
and
30%
on
the
gross
sales
price
of
items
such
as
jewelry,
furs,
liquor
and
other
items.
and
as
i
say,
this
is
not
just
physical
hard
goods
but
its
services
too,
like
gambling.
services
like
the
rental
of
safety
deposit
boxes,
cabaret
and
theater
tickets,
club
dues,
telephone
calls,
all
have
been
called
upon
to
bear
substantial
taxes.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
the
gambler
who
ultimately
bears
the
risk
of
the
bet
is
the
one
who
pays
the
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
so
if
gambler
one
takes
a
bet
and
lays
it
off
to
gambler
two,
gambler
one
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
is
excused
and
two
was
taken
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
and
the
statutes
specifically
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
just
as
a
dealer
in
retail
jewelry
had
to
add
a
20
or
even
sometimes
as
high
as
30%
tax
to
the
gross
sales
price
of
the
jewelry.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
pass
it
on
to
the
consumer.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
this
tax
is
set
up
in
the
same
way.
there
are
specific
sections
in
this
tax
which
state
that
the
professional
gambler
and
the
statute
says,
“the
man
in
the
business
of
gambling
can
pass
this
on
to
the
consumer.”
you
come
in
to
place
a
two-dollar
bet
with
the
professional
booking
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
you
can
--
he
can
charge
it
to
20
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
and
there's
no
reason
that
this
tax
couldn't
be
employed
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
these
other
taxes.
the
congress
said
that
the
discussion
on
the
florida
house
was
something
like
this.
the
tax
will
result
in
a
further
increase
in
the
betting
odds
which
are
already
stacked
against
the
individual
better.
however,
if
as
there
probably
will
be
a
substantial
number
of
people
who
are
not
convinced
that
they
should
stop
betting
then,
“the
committees'
bill
will
exact
a
federal
tax
for
their
folly.”
it's
the
same
thing
as
the
tax
on
furs,
on
jewelry
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
sporting
goods
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
precisely,
precisely.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
that
many
taxes
are
passed
or
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
i
don't
think
there's
any
other
tax
--
well,
let
me
take
that
back.
there
are
other
taxes
of
course,
the
liquor
tax
is
a
very
substantial
tax
and
it
has
been
since
i
think
almost
the
first
congress,
on
the
distillation
and
sale
of
liquor,
a
very
substantial
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
i
don't
think
so,
i
hope
not.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
don't
think
congress
had
any
doubt
that
this
tax
would
pay
its
way
either.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
estimated
collections
would
be
as
high
as
$400
million
a
year.
the
revenue
produced
has
been
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
has
been
somewhat
--
has
been
considerably
less.
but
congress
has
declined
sometimes
of
course,
for
economy
measures
to
appropriate
the
money
for
additional
agents
to
enforce
many
of
these
taxes.
the
revenue
has
been
disappointing.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
they
haven't
--
they
haven't
supplied
an
adequate
staff
to
enforce
this
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
how
much
has
it
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
oh,
i
don't
know,
whether
the
number
of
people.
i
think
there's
a
good
deal
of
overlapping
functions
within
the
internal
revenue
service
and
many
people
enforced
different
taxes.
i
should
think
that
when
a
group
of
agents
conduct
an
investigation
of
a
gambling
operation
that
they're
seeking
not
merely
to
collect
this
federal
excise
tax
but
to
make
sure
that
the
gamblers
are
paying
their
federal
income
taxes.
we
don't
know
to
what
extent
gamblers
have
declined
to
fully
comply
with
the
federal
income
taxes
either.
that's
a
continuing
operation.
and
i
think
many
of
the
costs
that
are
incurred
in
enforcing
this
tax
are
precisely
overlapping
with
the
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
it
would
probably
be
very
difficult
because
as
i
say
the
agents
enforce
a
variety
of
taxes.
and
i
don't
know
and
i
will
if
--
if
your
--
your
honor
would
like
me
to,
i'll
try
to
find
out
whether
there
any
separate
agents
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i'll,
i'll
--
i'll
look
into
the
matter
if
you'd
like
me
to
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
that
when
the
commissioner
comes
in
and
presents
his
budget
requests
each
year,
he
breaks
it
down
to
a
certain
extent,
and
when
they
don't
supply
all
the
money
requested,
agents
have
to
be
allocated
as
the
commissioner
thinks
proper.
i
don't
know
that
congress
has
ever
prohibited
them
from
adding
people
to
this
area.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
new
taxes
are
added
of
course
new
agents
must
be
supplied
to
enforce
them.
there
is
this
overlap.
but
the
numbers
of
agents
who
have
enforced
this
tax
have
never
been
as
great
as
would
be
required
for
full
enforcement.
i
would
add
one
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
a
$100
million
which
i
should
think
is
--
is
a
substantial
amount.
moreover
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
over
something
more
like
a
12
or
13-year
period.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right
your
honor.
i
would
add
one
other
factor.
it
maybe
that
if
this
court
decides
this
case
as
we
are
asking
them
to
and
eliminates
the
doubt
as
to
whether
gamblers
have
to
pay
this
tax,
if
there's
ever
been
any
--
any
such
doubt
that
we
will
have
a
great
deal
more
of
voluntary
compliance.
does
the
court
recognize
this
and
has
recognized
during
the
arguments
in
this
case.
it
hasn't
been
easy
to
get
gamblers
to
comply.
i
think
a
clear
ruling
is
going
to
make
it
easier
to
get
people
to
comply.
but
i
would
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
oh,
well,
i,
i
can't
tell
you
how
much
was
collected
but
the
government
tried
hard.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
but,
but
that
didn't
make
it
unconstitutional.
so
it
does
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
i,
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
federal
license
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
this
court
considered
that
question
many
years
ago
in
the
license
tax
cases
and
held
that
when
congress
charges
a
person
a
tax
to
operate
even
though
his
business
is
illegal,
and
that
was
exactly
the
same
question
people
were
selling
liquor
and
other
items
which
were
legal
in
some
states
and
illegal
in
others.
this
court
said
congress
is
not
giving
the
man
a
license
to
operate.
congress
is
merely
charging
him
a
tax
which
congress
is
perfectly
privileged
to
do
and
that
if
the
state
wants
to
enforce
its
laws
against
them,
passed
laws
legalizing
or
prohibiting
these
activities,
that's
up
to
the
states.
but
we
give
them
no
license
to
operate
that
the
statutes
are
quite
clear.
we
don't
in
anyway
say
to
them
what
you
are
doing
is
permissible.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
we're
not
going
to
come
after
them
if
they
pay
their
taxes.
and
the
same
thing
is
true,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
very
strongly
on
a
large
number
of
other
excise
taxes.
this
isn't
the
only
tax
where
this
court
is
going
to
have
the
problem
here
in
question.
there
has
traditionally
been
as
a
tax
as
i
say
on
jewelry
and
furs
running
as
high
as
30%
gross.
take
a
man
who
is
engaged
primarily
in
selling,
hot
jewelry
and
furs,
is
he
exempted
from
this
tax?
because
if
he
paid
the
tax,
he
would
be
admitting
that
he
was
selling
jewelry
and
furs.
don't
forget
he
was
indicted
under
state
law.
his
primary
defense
would
be
i
never
sold
jewelry
and
furs.
that's
--
that's
a
very
likely
defense.
same
thing
is
true
of,
of
bucket
shops
as
your
honors
pointed
out
or
boiler
rooms
or
any
other
security
operations
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
because
there's
a
federal
tax
--
there's
a
federal
tax
on
the
transfer
of
securities.
if
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
certain
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
certainly
i
have
a
lot
more
difficulty
if
i
was
up
here
defending
a
tax
on
illegal
gambling
or
on
illegal
transfers
of
securities
or
the
illegal
sale
of
jewelry
and
furs,
i
am
not
and
i
can't
really
answer
definitively
that
question.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
for
one
reason
i
have
more
difficulty
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
one
reason
i
have
more
difficulty
is
this
court
once
considered
it
in
the
constantine
case
and
held
that
a
tax
of
a
thousand
dollars
on
people
selling,
i
think
it
was
liquor
in
that
case,
in
violation
of
state
law
was
unconstitutional.
they
upheld
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
case
a
lesser
tax,
$25.00
upon
sale
of
liquor.
and
they
said,
you
got
to
pay
that
whether
you're
an
illegal
operator
or
a
legal
one
which
you
don't
have
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
you
can't
penalize
at
this
other
penalty
and
this
is
not
a
--
a
penalty.
this
is
a
revenue
measure.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
its
part
of
panoply
of
revenue
measures.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no
i
don't.
nevada
has
been
mentioned
to
many
times
for
me
to
go
deeply
into
that.
i
don't
know
whether
other
states
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
new
hampshire
has
a
lottery
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
that
a
specific
exception
was
passed
in
the
federal
statute
to
exempt
state
lotteries
of
various
kinds.
on
the
concept
which
has
been,
i
think,
contained
in
most
of
our
revenue
measures
that
the
federal
government
shouldn't
impose
a
tax
on
the
revenues
of
the
state
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes
(voice
overlap)
there
is
at
least
one
other
state
and
that
allow
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
that
--
that
allows
some,
yes.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
the
state
of
washington
--
the
state
of
washington
has
--
has
for
long
periods
of
time
legalized
certain
forms
of
gambling
including
perhaps
limited
to
punchboards.
that's
covered
by
this
statute.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
other
states
may
legalize
punchboards
or
they
may
legalize
slot
machines
or
other
things.
this
of
course
is
a
federal
tax
on
--
on
slot
machines,
a
separate
tax.
but
i
didn't
mention
it's
another
excise
tax.
some
states
i'm
sure
have
legalized
slot
machines
or
it
is
not?
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
a
bookmaking
is
covered
by
this
statute.
nevada
for
example,
doesn't
legalize
--
i
know,
nevada
does
legalized
bookmaking
and
it's
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
there
are
other
states
that
did
legalize
it
but
i
don't
have
the
--
i
don't
have
the
score.
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
other
states.
we
--
i
haven't
made
a
complete
review
of
the
state
clause.
congress
quite
clearly
when
it
passed
the
statutes
said
that
it
was
taxing
these
forms
of
gambling
whether
illegal
or
legal.
it
recognized
that
in
some
jurisdictions
they
were
legal,
washington
punchboards,
nevada
large
numbers
--
large
types
of
gambling.
congress
wasn't
concerned
with
that
at
that
time,
just
as
congress
wasn't
concerned
when
it
passed
the
cabaret
tax
with
whether
a
man
was
operating
without
a
state
license
or
not.
could
a
man
who
is
operating
in
new
york
without
a
state
cabaret
license
declined
to
pay
the
federal
cabaret
tax
on
the
ground
that
that
would
be
a
link
in
the
chain
incriminating.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
just
suppose
it
depends
on
how
you
define
cabarets.
if
cabaret
is
mean
the
serving
of
liquor
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
many
states
outlaw
all
cabarets
which
serve
liquor
by
the
drink.
they
probably
allow
other
cabarets
if
anybody
can
figure
out
a
way
to
be
in
business
and
make
money
without
liquor
by
the
drink.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i,
don't
know
of
--
of
any
of
hand.
the
federal
cabaret
tax
doesn't
depend
on
the
serving
of
liquor.
these
things
operate
on
different,
on
different
points.
the
federal
tax
applies
where
it
is
entertainment.
the
state
tax
--
the
state
may
outlaw
serving
of
liquor
by
the
drink
and
that
may
really
outlaw
any
cabaret
with
entertainment
because
there's
no
economic
way
to
run
one.
all
states
of
course,
make
it
illegal
to
sell
certain
kinds
of
securities
or
unapproved
securities.
yet,
the
federal
tax
supplies
equally,
stamp
transfer
tax
on
a
sale
of
any
security
legal
or
illegal.
the
sale
of
theater
tickets
is
until
recently
for
many
years
have
been
taxed
by
congress
and
yet,
if
a
man
is
a
scalper
of
tickets
without
a
license
in
the
state
of
new
york
where
you
got
be
licensed
to
be
a
scalper.
he
can't
say
i
don't
--
i
won't,
i'm
exempted
from
the
federal
tax,
i
submit.
he
doesn't
get
an
exemption
from
the
payment
of
the
tax.
just
how
much
information,
he
must
report
whether
he
must
register,
if
there's
a
registration
provision.
how
much
detail
he
must
give
whether
he
has
filed
a
return
that
says,
this
is
x
or
y
kind
of
tax.
he's
not
involved
in
this
case.
the
income
tax
problem
is
really
not
all
the
different,
all
completely
different
from
this.
i
submit
that
accepting
the
provisions
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
raise
serious
questions
with
the
income
tax.
if
a
man
is
a
bank
employee
and
has
for
many
years
earned
$5000
a
year
which
is
reported
to
him
on
his
w2
return.
he
staples
that
on
his
return
and
he
files
it
every
year.
then
one
year
he
embezzles
$500,000
from
his
bank.
he
might
well
say,
do
i
have
to
put
this
down
on
my
return?
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
even
as
miscellaneous
income
of
$500,000,
if
he's
--
if
he
is
indicted
for
embezzlement.
if
he's
indicted
for
embezzlement
and
this
return
is
introduced
against
him.
it's
one
link
in
the
evidence.
he's
the
only
of
the
40
employees
in
the
bank
that
had
$500,000
worth
of
miscellaneous
income,
the
same
year
that
the
bank
showed
up
missing
$500,000.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
well
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
that's
a
very
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
was
that
set
it
in
court?
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
let
me
try
to
answer
at
that
way.
you
can
answer
that
question,
“yes,
he's
entitled
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
answer
that
question.”
we
can
answer
--
we
could
both
assume
arguendo
for
this
case
that
he
could
decline
that
information
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
without
deciding
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
am
not
sure
if
it's
my
place
to
concede
that
he
could.
i've
got
pretty
good
personal
ideas
to
whether
he
could
or
not.
but
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
i
may
and
i'm
going
to
try
to
answer
your
question
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
the
federal
internal
revenue
code
does
require
you
to
state
on
your
income
tax
return
the
source
of
your
income.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
it
doesn't
say
in
a
general
way.
it's
pretty
clear,
the
source
of
your
income.
i
think
you
--
it
further
requires
that
if
you're
in
the
business
of
gambling.
in
the
business
of
gambling
that
you
file
a
schedule
c
which
is
a
long
schedule
state
the
nature
of
your
business,
state
the
gross
income,
identify
each
expense,
that's
required
by
the
internal
revenue
code.
as
i
read
it
and
i
think
--
i
think
as
anyone
would
read
it,
it's
required.
and
there
is
a
crime,
willful
failure
to
supply
adequate
information
or
required
information
on
the
return.
now,
if
a
gambler
filed
a
return
and
all
he
put
on
was
miscellaneous
income,
$300,000
and
he
declined
to
supply
any
of
this
other
information.
and
he
was
indicted
for
failure
to
supply
necessary
information
which
i
state
again
is
a
separate
crime.
not
failure
to
pay
but
failure
to
supply
information.
he'd
reported
all
his
income
but
he
didn't
tell
where
it
came
from,
as
he's
required
by
law
to
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
then
he
could
say
the
fifth
amendment
excuses
me
from
supplying
all
this
information
but
it
doesn't
excuse
me
from
paying.
and
if
that
was
this
case
then
i
would
be
here
arguing
about
whether
he
has
to
supply
the
information,
but
i'm
not.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
you
did
it
intentionally,
willfully.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
must
speak
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
must
respectfully
disagree.
you
would
be
guilty
of
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
when
this
court
has
the
question
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
you
could
and
it
wouldn't
be
willful
failure
file
because
he
filed
a
return
under
the
hypothetical
mr.
justice
stewart
has
said.
and
it
wouldn't
be
will
--
willful
failure
to
pay,
it
would
only
be
willful
failure
to
supply
required
information
or
willful
misstatement
of
required
information
which
is
about
the
same
thing.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
gets
to
that
in
the
final
analysis.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
it's
not
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
all
i
can
say
is
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
not
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
in
this
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
if
pressed
to
answer,
how
i
would
--
what
i
would
say
if
i
had
willful
failure
to
supply
necessary
information
in
this
case.
i
would
answer,
no,
its
different.
it's
not
--
it's
not
simple.
it's
not
that
simple.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
the
reason
that
the
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
don't
think
the
government
very
often
indicts
a
person
for
willful
failure
to
supply
information
when
he
says,
the
reason
i
didn't
supplied
it
was
because
i've
have
a
fifth
amendment
right.
i
paid
my
tax
and
now
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
where
i
got
the
money.
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
involving
that
questions
being
indicted.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
there's
very
clearly
a
difference
in
requiring
a
man
to
pay
a
tax
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i'm
not
saying
they
must
stop.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
i
don't
have
any
answer
whether
they
must
stop
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
case
because
this
is
the
question
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
whether
a
man
must
pay
a
tax.
not
file
a
return
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
not
supply
all
the
information
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
in
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that
would
be
the
issue
in
that
case.
it's,
it's
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
submit
that
when
this
court
spent
close
to
a
hundred
pages
of
its
decisions,
a
hundred
pages
of
its
reports
within
recent
years
in
writing,
the
james
and
the
rutkin
cases
involving
the
taxability
of
income
from
extortion
and
embezzlement.
and
those
were
hard
fought
cases
and
when
this
court
finally
decided
that
that
income
was
taxable,
i
submit
that
this
court
wasn't
engaging
in
an
exercise
in
futility
as
it
would
be
if
a
man
didn't
have
to
report
illegal
income
because
that
information
might
be
used
against
him.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
if
he
had
paid
the
tax
and
filed
the
730
return
which
says,
payment
of
excise
tax
on
gambling
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
they
would
disclose
the
730.
if
he
had
sent
in
a
check
which
and
said
along
with
it.
this
is
in
payment
of
an
excise
tax
and
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
which
one
but
its
an
excise
tax
of
some
kind
of
which
there
are
hundreds
or
he
had
--
instead
of
filling
the
730,
the
gambling
excise
tax
return,
he
had
filed
a
general
excise
tax
return
which
has
all
sorts
of
boxes
to
check
and
he
didn't
check
any.
they
wouldn't
have
been
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
there's
nothing
in
the
statutes
on
that.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
there's
nothing
in
the
statutes
which
prohibits
the
government
from
making
any
such
information
available
to
the
states.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
which
authorize
it.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
obvious
as
we
both
recognize
that
once
the
government
has
collected
its
income
and
there
has
been
disclosed
to
the
government
a
violation
of
a
state
law.
the
federal
government
doesn't
consider
that
it
must
unless
congress
or
this
court
tells
it
to
keep
that
information
secret.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
it's
well
recognized.
it's
just
a
certain
degree
of
cooperation
which
i
think
we
--
many
people
laud
between
–
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
state
and
federal
law
enforcement.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
oh,
they
don't
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
it
had
certainly
a
substantial
reason.
i
do
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
could
make
--
i
could
think
of
many
other
reasons
perhaps
this
state
has
a
tax
on
the
income
--
an
income
tax
anyone
had
checked
his
gross
income.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
can
think
of
no
other
reason.
now,
what
i
have
said
here
is,
this
man
cannot
excuse
his
failure
to
pay
the
tax
because
he
wants
to
excuse
his
failure
to
file
a
return.
if
he'd
been
indicted
and
tried
and
convicted
in
appeal
to
this
court
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
file
a
form
730.
i
would
probably
come
in
here
and
defend
the
government
on
that
point.
but
this
court
might
reach
a
very
much
different
result.
i
can't
predict
what
would
happen
in
that
case.
the
question
is
whether
he
has
to
pay
the
tax?
and
he
could
have
paid
it
by
filing
a
general
excise
tax
return
or
by
sending
a
letter
saying,
this
is
for
excise
taxes.
by
doing
that
he
would
have
violated
apparently
the
requirements
of
the
statutes.
but
he
had
to
have
a
very
solid
defense,
fifth
amendment
for
that.
just
as
gamblers
have
for
many
years
and
virtually
everyone
who
engages
in
illegal
activities
have
for
many
years
known
that
they
could
report
under
income
tax
return,
miscellaneous
income.
the
statute
requires
them
to
file
extensive
forms
schedule
c
which
is
a
very
extensive
form
if
you're
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
and
make
many
disclosures
about
your
trade
or
business,
but
they
don't.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes.
any
trade
or
business
including
gambling
or
--
or
operating
a
bucket
shop
or
anything
else.
but
they
don't
do
that
if
its
illegal
income.
they
put
it
down
as
miscellaneous
and
they
say
if
the
federal
government
says,
where
is
your
schedule
c?
they
say,
fifth
amendment.
and
i
think
this
case
goes
well
beyond
all
those
other
cases.
this
is
the
failure
to
pay
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
thank
you
very
much.
i
submit
that
the
federal
government
does
not
have
a
constitutional
obligation
to
excuse
a
person
from
paying
a
tax
because
he's
engaged
in
an
illegal
business.
be
it
an
excise
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i'd
like
to
answer
that
into
two
steps.
the
first
of
which
you
will
not
consider
a
complete
answer
but
i'll
move
to
what
i
think
is
a
complete
answer.
the
first
step
is
that
federal
government
does
impart.
it
imposes
a
tax
on
the
sale
of
jewelry,
furs
and
many
other
items
and
that's
whether
they're
legal
or
illegal.
and
i,
i
submit
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
alright.
my
second
answer
is
even
if
this
was
a
tax
on
nearly
the
sale
of
stolen
jewelry
and
furs
and
nothing
more.
then,
i
would
come
in
here
and
defend
that
tax
in
the
same
way.
whether
you'd
reach
the
same
result
or
not
that
i
don't
know
as
you
will
in
this
case.
but
what
i
would
answer
is
if
that
was
one
of
200
excise
taxes,
he
could
send
in
a
check
for
payment
and
say,
this
is
for
an
excise
tax
and
i
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
tell
you
which
one.
and
he
will
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
don't
see
why
he
isn't.
why
not?
if
he
were
indicted
for
a
failure
to
file
the
proper
return
and
he
had
appealed
to
this
court
from
that,
he
would
have
a
much
different
argument,
and
he
might
well
have
a
proper
fifth
amendment
argument
that
he
didn't
have
to
file
the
return.
and
that
conviction
would
be
overturned.
possibly,
i
don't
concede
it
here.
i
don't
have
to.
but
what
i
say
is
this
is
failure
to
pay
and
there
is
not
great
difference,
i
don't
think,
between
a
tax
on
gambling,
and
jewelry,
and
furs,
and
radios,
and
television
sets,
and
liquor
--
liquor
from
an
illegal
distiller
that
might
have
been
under
that
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
as,
as
i
submit,
the
government
had
a
perfect
right
to
do.
we
did
indict
him
for
failure
to
file
a
return.
and
i
submit
that
if
after
today,
he
continues
to
engage
or
someone
continues
to
engage
in
the
business
of
gambling,
let
him
pay
his
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
take
a
check
and
put
it
in
an
envelop
and
put
in
a
letter
perhaps
that
said,
this
is
in
payment
of
an
excise
tax.
or
possibly
he
could
file
a
return
instead
of
a
730,
file
a
return
like
this.
a
720
which
says,
excise
tax
as
in
general,
as
you
can
see
it's
close
to
the
payment
for
excise
taxes.
and
here
where
it
says,
which
one?
and
check
the
right
box.
he
says,
i
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
check
the
correct
box.
but
to
exempt
him
from
the
payment
of
this
excise
tax,
what
it
seems
to
me
goes
substantially
beyond
just
as
simple
gambling
tax.
difficult
i
think
to
distinguish
between
that
and
the
payment
of
income
taxes.
counsel
for
both
petitioners
here
have
said,
“oh,
we
concede
our
people
have
to
pay
income
taxes
on
their
gambling
business.”
well,
i
don't
really
see
the
distinction
if
they're
indicted
for
gambling
in
a
state
and
somebody
puts
in
an
income
tax
returns
as
miscellaneous,
$800,000
income
last
year
and
then
the
state
introduced
its
evidence
which
tends
to
show
that
they
had
no
other
--
no
gainful
occupation
of
any
kind
except
their
connection
with
various
bookmakers,
et
cetera.
i
think
that
that
would
certainly
be
a
link
in
the
chain
and
i
want
to
read
you
just
one
sentence.
one
sentence
out
of
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
grosso
case.
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
different
than,
than
what
the
counsel
said
on
oral
argument.
he
said
this,
“it
is
petitioner's
position
that
he
is
protected
as
fully
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
when
the
government
seeks
the
information
connection
with
collection
of
a
tax
as
if
the
government
would
seek
the
information
by
asking
him
the
question
before
a
grand
jury.”
can
you
imagine
putting
a
gambler
on
the
stand
and
saying
to
him,
how
much
income
did
you
have
last
year
from
sources
other
than
interest,
dividends,
salary,
annuities,
pension
plans,
et
cetera,
the
various
items
on
the
return?
now
that,
how
much
miscellaneous
income
did
you
have
last
year?
he'd
say,
he
takes
the
fifth
amendment.
he
doesn't
have
to
testify
to
that
before
a
grand
jury.
i'm
sure.
so
that
if
what
counsel
is
arguing
for
is
that
--
that
the
grand
jury
standard
applies
to
the
payment
of
a
tax.
i
think
this
is
a
very
sweeping
doctrine
and
one
that
gives
me
substantial
cause.
since,
since
my
time
is
up,
i
would
like
to
say
just
two
things
very
briefly.
if
this
court
for
any
reason
which
i
can't
conceive
of,
rejects
my
principal
argument
and
holds
that
a
man
doesn't
have
to
pay
a
tax
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
say,
i
don't
think
he
would.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
because
he
have
to
pay
an
income
tax
on
his
miscellaneous
income
or
can
he
exclude
all
of
his
income
from
gambling
because
he
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
that.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
the
income
tax,
that's
right.
the
income
tax
on
gambling,
but
petitioners
here
say,
we
don't
--
we
concede
that
we
have
to
pay
our
income
tax.
i
think
that
wholly
inconsistent
with
their
position.
if
they've
got
to
pay
an
income
tax,
they've
got
to
pay
an
excise
tax.
they
don't
have
to.
i
think
they
will
probably
have
a
constitutional
right
and
again,
i
say,
i
don't
concede
these
points
for
the
government.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
may
well
have
a
constitutional
right
on
their
income
tax
return
not
to
file
a
schedule
c
that
says
we're
in
the
business
of
gambling.
but
to
put
down
one
figure,
miscellaneous
income,
$200,000,
and
i
submit
that
they
can
do
the
same
thing
with
the
excise
tax,
enclose
a
check
in
an
envelop
with
a
general
excise
tax
return
or
even
with
a
letter
that
says,
this
is
for
excise
taxes.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
say
one
word
first
though,
if
for
any
reason
you
were
to
reject
the
argument
and
find
that
you
don't
have
to
pay
a
tax.
well,
then
i
agree
with
the
use
of
restriction
argument
enunciated
by
my
colleague
here.
the
same
thing
is
true
here
that
the
result
would
be
what
the
government
collects
the
tax
but
to
restrict
to
use
on
a
jury
trial
point.
i
would
say
that
it's
quite
clear
what
happened
here
after
approximately
one
day
of
deliberation,
the
judge
received
a
note.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
note
said,
although
the
note
was
note
reserved,
the
note
said,
“we
are
unable
to
agree
what
should
we
do?”
now,
the
judge
testified
to
that,
the
judge
explained
that
a
short
time
later.
the
judge
then
said
to
the
bailiff,
“tell
them
to
continue
deliberating.”
the
record
also
has
the
judge's
statement
that
that's
why
i
told
the
bailiff
to
tell
them.
within
45
minutes
after
that
communication
to
the
jury,
the
defense
counsel
learned
about
the
incident.
he
did
not
at
that
time
say,
let's
preserve
the
note.
i'm
sure
the
note
was
still
in
existence
within
45
minutes.
he
did
not
at
that
time
say,
let's
put
the
bailiff
understand
and
ask
him,
bring
the
bailiff
in.
put
him
under
oath
and
ask
him,
what
did
you
tell
the
jury?
he
didn't
suggest
any
of
those
procedures.
what
he
did
is
he
waited,
and
two
days
later,
while
the
jury
was
still
deliberating.
the
jury
deliberations
having
been
interrupted
for
a
day-and-a-half
because
of
the
illness
of
a
juror
but
when
the
jury
got
back
to
deliberate
and
again,
they
send
exactly
the
same
note
to
the
judge,
said,
“we
are
enable
to
agree,
what
should
we
do?”
and
the
judge
looked
at
and
said,
“this
is
about
the
same
note
that
i
got
the
first
time
substantially
exactly
the
same.”
and
then
he
turned
to
the
bailiff,
this
was
in
the
presence
of
both
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
and
he
turned
to
the
bailiff
and
he
said,
“tell
them
to
continue
deliberating.”
the
same
thing
he
told
them
the
first
time.
the
bailiff
turned
around
and
he
walked
out,
and
the
defense
counsel
didn't
say
nor
the
defendant
jump
up
and
say,
wait
a
minute,
bring
the
jury
in
and
let's
do
it
all
in
an
open
court.
he
had
no
objection
at
that
time
neither
the
defendant
nor
his
counsel
to
the
bailiff
going
out
and
saying,
telling
the
jury
to
continue
deliberating.
the
bailiff
had
spent
something
like
three-and-a-half
days
with
this
jury
shepherding
him
from
hotel,
to
court,
to
lunch,
and
so
forth.
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
talk
to
the
jury
if
he
wanted
to
about
this
case
and
to
prejudice
their
deliberations
and
certainly,
the
fact
that
we
was
told
--
go
in
and
tell
them
to
continue
deliberating,
didn't
give
him
any
great
opportunity
to
step
in
there
and
do
anything.
moreover,
one
more
point,
during
the
course
of
this
jury
deliberation
which
took
place
after
approximately
a
six-week
trial,
a
doctor
was
called
to
minister
to
one
of
the
jurors
who
would
become
ill.
the
defense
attorney
said,
“oh,
no
wait
a
minute,
what
went
on
here?
how
long
was
this
one
juror
was
separate
from
the
other
jurors
and
is
he
in
shape
to
testify
and
so
forth.”
and
the
judge
at
the
time
called
in
at
least
three
people
who
were
in
contact
with
the
jury.
he
called
in
his
clerk,
he
called
in
the
chief
marshall,
and
he
called
in
the
deputy
marshall,
and
they
were
put
there
and
examined
on
what
it
happened
here.
now,
i
submit
that
if
the
defense
counsel
had
wanted
to
ask
the
bailiff
who
had
been
told,
go
tell
the
jury
to
continue
deliberating.
did
you
tell
them
anything
else
what
did
you
say?
the
bailiff
was
in
and
out
of
this
room.
the
record
shows
that
the
bailiff
was
in
and
out
of
the
room
where
counsel
and
the
judge
were
present
a
number
of
times
at
least
ones
or
twice.
and
he
could
have
at
anytime
said,
put
the
bailiff
on
the
stand.
just
like
you
did
with
the
clerk,
the
chief
marshall,
and
the
deputy
chief
marshall,
he
didn't
it.
nor
did
he
object
to
the
second
time
this
incident
was
repeated.
note
followed
by
an
oral
discussion,
an
oral
instruction
to
go
tell
the
jury
to
continue
to
deliberating.
what
happened
was?
he
waited
until
the
jury
brought
in
the
verdict.
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
said,
“where's
the
note?”
where's
the
note?
he
said,
well,
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
the
note,
it's
five
days
ago.
he
said,
“well,
how
do
i
know
what
the
bailiff
said?”
this,
this
all
happened
five
days
later.
i
submit
that
if
this
court
reverses
in
this
--
for
this
error
that
petitioner
will
probably
have
the
best
odds
he's
ever
had
in
his
life
because
what
will
happen
is
he
could
have
sat
there
quietly
and
if
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
he
was
off
for
good.
and
if
the
verdict
--
if
they
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no,
i
can't
your
honor.
i
think
that
i
can't
give
you
a
capsule
answer.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony
put
in
because
this
case
concerned
failure
to
pay
--
oh,
i
can't
answer
that
question.
let
me
do
this.
the
case
concerned
failure
to
pay
the
gambling
tax
over
a
very
long
period
something
like
three
years.
now,
the
record
does
contain
evidence
that
in
a
one
week
period
in
february
of
1959,
i
believe
it
was.
this
gambling
operation
that
defendant
was
convicted
of
--
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
being
a
part
off,
took
in
a
gross
amount
of
$250,000
in
a
one
week
period.
now,
the
scope
and
size
of
that
operation
as
indicated
by
that
evidence,
i
think
might
account
for
the
fact
that
he
was
indicted
for
failure
to
pay
his
tax
over
a
three-year
period
that
the
government
had
to
bring
in
a
large
amount
of
testimony
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
know
the
defendant
took
the
stand
and
testified
extensively.
he
testified
a
great
of
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
they
offered
testimony
from
agents
who
had
been
engaged
in
a
raid
on
his
operations,
people
who
had
been
connected
with
his
operations,
and
the
usual
type
of
testimony
that
comes
in
and
would
permit
to
an
income
tax
of
a
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
there's
no
doubt
but
that
the
question
of
whether
engaged
in
gambling
came
into
it.
his
defense
incidentally
your
honor
was,
i
was
a
gambler
until
1951.
then
i
learned
about
this
federal
tax
and
so
then
i
give
the
whole
operation
to
my
brother
and
i
think
this
is
associated
with
it
ever
since
then.
i'm
not
connected
with
the
operation.
and
you
can
imagine
that
there
would
be
a
large
number
of
witnesses
about
his
--
about
his
activities.
he
testified
himself
that
he
was
not
in
a
business
of
being
a
gambler
but
he
gambled.
this
federal
tax
don't
forget
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no,
i
don't
know.
he
testified
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
it's
a
very
long
record
your
honor
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
and
we
haven't
reproduce
the
whole
thing
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
certainly
we
can
make
the
entire
record
available,
if
it
isn't
already.
i'm
sure
it
is
in
the
clerk's
office.
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony
in
addition
on
his
own
gambling
activities.
he
testified,
he
made
$50,000
a
year
net
from
nine
business
gambling.
in
other
words,
friendly
card
games,
race
tracks,
et
cetera
but
his
defense
was,
he
wasn't
in
the
business
of
gambling.
he
didn't
run
an
organized
gambling
operation
and
the
federal
tax
didn't
applied
to
that.
and
virtually
all
of
the
people
who
were
not
privileged
and
who
were
not
also
codefendants
or
co-indictees
were
called
to
the
stand
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
there
were
two
or
three
others
who
indicted
with
him.
two
or
three
others
were
indicted
with
him
but
--
and
it
was
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
thank
you
sir.
sorry
it
takes
much
time.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
commence
by
pointing
out
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
previous
case
which
the
court
heard
because
i
think
there
is
a
very
relevant
difference.
there
are
at
least
four
federal
crimes
connected
with
the
tax
area.
there
is
first
of
all,
failure
to
register
and
that's
not
applicable
in
the
income
tax
area
but
it
is
of
course
applicable
with
many
excise
taxes
including
the
tax
here
in
question.
there
are
three
other
crimes
which
apply
i
believe
equally
to
the
income
tax
area
and
virtually
all
federal
taxes.
they
are
willful
failure
to
file
a
return,
willful
failure
to
disclose
required
information
on
that
return,
and
finally,
a
third
discreet
crime,
willful
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
now,
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
the
third
of
those
three
crimes,
willful
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
in
other
words,
this
court
need
not
decide
in
this
case
whether
petitioner
could
have
been
convicted
for
willfully
failing
to
file
a
730
return.
a
copy
of
which
is
in
the
record
that
is
a
return
that
states
on
the
top
gambling
excise
tax.
this
court
need
not
decide
whether
if
he
had
filed
either
that
return
or
some
other
return,
whether
he
could
be
convicted
for
a
willfully
failing
to
disclose
required
information
on
that
return.
the
only
question
involved
here,
is
willful
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
it
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
holds
that
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax
and
i
should
assume
he
doesn't
have
to
-
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
in
order
to
reach
that
you've
found
that
he
doesn't
have
to
get
this.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
to
reach
the
third
question,
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
first
two.
now
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes.
there
are
a
large
number
of
other
statutes,
many
of
them
described
in
our
brief
in
the
introductory
portion
of
our
briefs
in
these
two
cases.
they
include
for
example,
one
--
one
example
is
the
liquor
area.
if
you
want
to
go
into
the
distilling
business,
you
must
register.
all
the
big
distillers
of
course
register.
if
you
want
to
become
a
wholesaler
of
liquor,
you
must
register.
and
there
are
taxes
then
imposed
on
the
distillation
of
liquor
that
raise
substantial
sums
of
money
and
many
other
federal
excise
taxes
are
administered
the
same
way.
this
is
not
an
unusual
aspect.
but
i'm
not
here
dealing
of
course,
as
justice
fortas
has
pointed
out
with
the
registration
provision.
this
court
could,
could
hold
for
the
petitioner
in
the
marchetti
case.
i
don't
--
i
urge
you
not
to
but
this
court
could
hold
for
the
petitioner
in
the
marchetti
case
and
yet
hold
that
a
person
is
not
excused
from
paying
a
tax
because
his
business
is
illegal.
and
that
same
question
is
applicable,
i
think,
not
merely
to
the
gambling
tax
but
to
a
host
of
other
taxes.
and
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
point
that
out.
there
are
of
course
two
principal
federal
taxes.
there
are
the
excise
taxes
and
there
is
the
income
statement
gift
tax
group.
now,
the
excise
tax
doesn't
consist
of
one
tax,
a
gambling
tax.
there
were
until
recently
with
an
excise
tax
reduction
over
a
year
ago.
hundreds
of
excise
taxes
all
going
to
make
up
a
single
package.
there
were
excise
taxes
imposed
on
a
very
large
number
and
are
traditionally
held
then
some
of
them
dating
back
into
the
nineteenth
century
and
many
of
them
dating
from
at
least
the
1930s
and
early
40s
and
a
very
large
number
of
luxury
or
non-essential
goods.
but
--
just
examples
would
be
radios,
television
sets,
jewelry,
furs,
liquors,
cigarettes,
sporting
goods,
cameras,
cabaret
taxes,
private
club
dues,
safe
deposit
boxes,
playing
cards,
bowling
alleys,
pool
tables,
the
gambling
tax
is
not
at
all
unusual
in
that
regard.
when
congress
considered
the
gambling
tax,
they
discussed
this
aspect
of
it.
and
how
did
the
legislative
history
reads
something
like
this,
commercialized
gambling
holds
the
unique
position
of
being
a
multibillion
dollar
nationwide
business
that
is
remained
comparatively
free
from
taxation
by
either
state
or
federal
governments.
this
relative
immunity
from
taxation
has
persisted
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
wagering
has
many
characteristics
which
make
it
particularly
suitable
as
a
subject
for
taxation.
your
committee
is
convinced
that
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
present
need
for
increased
revenue.
this
was
the
korean
war
days.
especially,
at
a
time
when
many
consumer
items
of
a
semi-necessary
nature
are
being
called
upon
to
bear
new
or
additional
tax
burdens.
at
the
same
time,
the
rates
on
things
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
1951,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
at
the
same
period,
taxes
ranged
as
high
as
30%
of
the
gross
sales
price
on
many
items.
subsequently
reduced
to
20%
and
now
many
of
the
taxes
have
been
repealed.
we
don't
know
whether
temporarily
or
permanently
in
light
of
new
revenue
needs.
but
taxes
range
as
high
as
20%
and
30%
on
the
gross
sales
price
of
items
such
as
jewelry,
furs,
liquor
and
other
items.
and
as
i
say,
this
is
not
just
physical
hard
goods
but
its
services
too,
like
gambling.
services
like
the
rental
of
safety
deposit
boxes,
cabaret
and
theater
tickets,
club
dues,
telephone
calls,
all
have
been
called
upon
to
bear
substantial
taxes.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
the
gambler
who
ultimately
bears
the
risk
of
the
bet
is
the
one
who
pays
the
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
so
if
gambler
one
takes
a
bet
and
lays
it
off
to
gambler
two,
gambler
one
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
is
excused
and
two
was
taken
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
and
the
statutes
specifically
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
just
as
a
dealer
in
retail
jewelry
had
to
add
a
20
or
even
sometimes
as
high
as
30%
tax
to
the
gross
sales
price
of
the
jewelry.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
pass
it
on
to
the
consumer.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
this
tax
is
set
up
in
the
same
way.
there
are
specific
sections
in
this
tax
which
state
that
the
professional
gambler
and
the
statute
says,
“the
man
in
the
business
of
gambling
can
pass
this
on
to
the
consumer.”
you
come
in
to
place
a
two-dollar
bet
with
the
professional
booking
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
you
can
--
he
can
charge
it
to
20
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
and
there's
no
reason
that
this
tax
couldn't
be
employed
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
these
other
taxes.
the
congress
said
that
the
discussion
on
the
florida
house
was
something
like
this.
the
tax
will
result
in
a
further
increase
in
the
betting
odds
which
are
already
stacked
against
the
individual
better.
however,
if
as
there
probably
will
be
a
substantial
number
of
people
who
are
not
convinced
that
they
should
stop
betting
then,
“the
committees'
bill
will
exact
a
federal
tax
for
their
folly.”
it's
the
same
thing
as
the
tax
on
furs,
on
jewelry
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
sporting
goods
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
precisely,
precisely.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
that
many
taxes
are
passed
or
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
i
don't
think
there's
any
other
tax
--
well,
let
me
take
that
back.
there
are
other
taxes
of
course,
the
liquor
tax
is
a
very
substantial
tax
and
it
has
been
since
i
think
almost
the
first
congress,
on
the
distillation
and
sale
of
liquor,
a
very
substantial
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
i
don't
think
so,
i
hope
not.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
don't
think
congress
had
any
doubt
that
this
tax
would
pay
its
way
either.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
estimated
collections
would
be
as
high
as
$400
million
a
year.
the
revenue
produced
has
been
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
has
been
somewhat
--
has
been
considerably
less.
but
congress
has
declined
sometimes
of
course,
for
economy
measures
to
appropriate
the
money
for
additional
agents
to
enforce
many
of
these
taxes.
the
revenue
has
been
disappointing.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
they
haven't
--
they
haven't
supplied
an
adequate
staff
to
enforce
this
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
how
much
has
it
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
oh,
i
don't
know,
whether
the
number
of
people.
i
think
there's
a
good
deal
of
overlapping
functions
within
the
internal
revenue
service
and
many
people
enforced
different
taxes.
i
should
think
that
when
a
group
of
agents
conduct
an
investigation
of
a
gambling
operation
that
they're
seeking
not
merely
to
collect
this
federal
excise
tax
but
to
make
sure
that
the
gamblers
are
paying
their
federal
income
taxes.
we
don't
know
to
what
extent
gamblers
have
declined
to
fully
comply
with
the
federal
income
taxes
either.
that's
a
continuing
operation.
and
i
think
many
of
the
costs
that
are
incurred
in
enforcing
this
tax
are
precisely
overlapping
with
the
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
it
would
probably
be
very
difficult
because
as
i
say
the
agents
enforce
a
variety
of
taxes.
and
i
don't
know
and
i
will
if
--
if
your
--
your
honor
would
like
me
to,
i'll
try
to
find
out
whether
there
any
separate
agents
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i'll,
i'll
--
i'll
look
into
the
matter
if
you'd
like
me
to
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
that
when
the
commissioner
comes
in
and
presents
his
budget
requests
each
year,
he
breaks
it
down
to
a
certain
extent,
and
when
they
don't
supply
all
the
money
requested,
agents
have
to
be
allocated
as
the
commissioner
thinks
proper.
i
don't
know
that
congress
has
ever
prohibited
them
from
adding
people
to
this
area.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
new
taxes
are
added
of
course
new
agents
must
be
supplied
to
enforce
them.
there
is
this
overlap.
but
the
numbers
of
agents
who
have
enforced
this
tax
have
never
been
as
great
as
would
be
required
for
full
enforcement.
i
would
add
one
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
a
$100
million
which
i
should
think
is
--
is
a
substantial
amount.
moreover
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
over
something
more
like
a
12
or
13-year
period.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right
your
honor.
i
would
add
one
other
factor.
it
maybe
that
if
this
court
decides
this
case
as
we
are
asking
them
to
and
eliminates
the
doubt
as
to
whether
gamblers
have
to
pay
this
tax,
if
there's
ever
been
any
--
any
such
doubt
that
we
will
have
a
great
deal
more
of
voluntary
compliance.
does
the
court
recognize
this
and
has
recognized
during
the
arguments
in
this
case.
it
hasn't
been
easy
to
get
gamblers
to
comply.
i
think
a
clear
ruling
is
going
to
make
it
easier
to
get
people
to
comply.
but
i
would
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
oh,
well,
i,
i
can't
tell
you
how
much
was
collected
but
the
government
tried
hard.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
but,
but
that
didn't
make
it
unconstitutional.
so
it
does
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
i,
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
federal
license
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
this
court
considered
that
question
many
years
ago
in
the
license
tax
cases
and
held
that
when
congress
charges
a
person
a
tax
to
operate
even
though
his
business
is
illegal,
and
that
was
exactly
the
same
question
people
were
selling
liquor
and
other
items
which
were
legal
in
some
states
and
illegal
in
others.
this
court
said
congress
is
not
giving
the
man
a
license
to
operate.
congress
is
merely
charging
him
a
tax
which
congress
is
perfectly
privileged
to
do
and
that
if
the
state
wants
to
enforce
its
laws
against
them,
passed
laws
legalizing
or
prohibiting
these
activities,
that's
up
to
the
states.
but
we
give
them
no
license
to
operate
that
the
statutes
are
quite
clear.
we
don't
in
anyway
say
to
them
what
you
are
doing
is
permissible.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
we're
not
going
to
come
after
them
if
they
pay
their
taxes.
and
the
same
thing
is
true,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
very
strongly
on
a
large
number
of
other
excise
taxes.
this
isn't
the
only
tax
where
this
court
is
going
to
have
the
problem
here
in
question.
there
has
traditionally
been
as
a
tax
as
i
say
on
jewelry
and
furs
running
as
high
as
30%
gross.
take
a
man
who
is
engaged
primarily
in
selling,
hot
jewelry
and
furs,
is
he
exempted
from
this
tax?
because
if
he
paid
the
tax,
he
would
be
admitting
that
he
was
selling
jewelry
and
furs.
don't
forget
he
was
indicted
under
state
law.
his
primary
defense
would
be
i
never
sold
jewelry
and
furs.
that's
--
that's
a
very
likely
defense.
same
thing
is
true
of,
of
bucket
shops
as
your
honors
pointed
out
or
boiler
rooms
or
any
other
security
operations
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
because
there's
a
federal
tax
--
there's
a
federal
tax
on
the
transfer
of
securities.
if
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
certain
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
certainly
i
have
a
lot
more
difficulty
if
i
was
up
here
defending
a
tax
on
illegal
gambling
or
on
illegal
transfers
of
securities
or
the
illegal
sale
of
jewelry
and
furs,
i
am
not
and
i
can't
really
answer
definitively
that
question.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
for
one
reason
i
have
more
difficulty
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
one
reason
i
have
more
difficulty
is
this
court
once
considered
it
in
the
constantine
case
and
held
that
a
tax
of
a
thousand
dollars
on
people
selling,
i
think
it
was
liquor
in
that
case,
in
violation
of
state
law
was
unconstitutional.
they
upheld
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
case
a
lesser
tax,
$25.00
upon
sale
of
liquor.
and
they
said,
you
got
to
pay
that
whether
you're
an
illegal
operator
or
a
legal
one
which
you
don't
have
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
you
can't
penalize
at
this
other
penalty
and
this
is
not
a
--
a
penalty.
this
is
a
revenue
measure.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
its
part
of
panoply
of
revenue
measures.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no
i
don't.
nevada
has
been
mentioned
to
many
times
for
me
to
go
deeply
into
that.
i
don't
know
whether
other
states
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
new
hampshire
has
a
lottery
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
that
a
specific
exception
was
passed
in
the
federal
statute
to
exempt
state
lotteries
of
various
kinds.
on
the
concept
which
has
been,
i
think,
contained
in
most
of
our
revenue
measures
that
the
federal
government
shouldn't
impose
a
tax
on
the
revenues
of
the
state
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes
(voice
overlap)
there
is
at
least
one
other
state
and
that
allow
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
that
--
that
allows
some,
yes.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
the
state
of
washington
--
the
state
of
washington
has
--
has
for
long
periods
of
time
legalized
certain
forms
of
gambling
including
perhaps
limited
to
punchboards.
that's
covered
by
this
statute.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
other
states
may
legalize
punchboards
or
they
may
legalize
slot
machines
or
other
things.
this
of
course
is
a
federal
tax
on
--
on
slot
machines,
a
separate
tax.
but
i
didn't
mention
it's
another
excise
tax.
some
states
i'm
sure
have
legalized
slot
machines
or
it
is
not?
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
a
bookmaking
is
covered
by
this
statute.
nevada
for
example,
doesn't
legalize
--
i
know,
nevada
does
legalized
bookmaking
and
it's
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
there
are
other
states
that
did
legalize
it
but
i
don't
have
the
--
i
don't
have
the
score.
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
other
states.
we
--
i
haven't
made
a
complete
review
of
the
state
clause.
congress
quite
clearly
when
it
passed
the
statutes
said
that
it
was
taxing
these
forms
of
gambling
whether
illegal
or
legal.
it
recognized
that
in
some
jurisdictions
they
were
legal,
washington
punchboards,
nevada
large
numbers
--
large
types
of
gambling.
congress
wasn't
concerned
with
that
at
that
time,
just
as
congress
wasn't
concerned
when
it
passed
the
cabaret
tax
with
whether
a
man
was
operating
without
a
state
license
or
not.
could
a
man
who
is
operating
in
new
york
without
a
state
cabaret
license
declined
to
pay
the
federal
cabaret
tax
on
the
ground
that
that
would
be
a
link
in
the
chain
incriminating.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
just
suppose
it
depends
on
how
you
define
cabarets.
if
cabaret
is
mean
the
serving
of
liquor
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
many
states
outlaw
all
cabarets
which
serve
liquor
by
the
drink.
they
probably
allow
other
cabarets
if
anybody
can
figure
out
a
way
to
be
in
business
and
make
money
without
liquor
by
the
drink.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i,
don't
know
of
--
of
any
of
hand.
the
federal
cabaret
tax
doesn't
depend
on
the
serving
of
liquor.
these
things
operate
on
different,
on
different
points.
the
federal
tax
applies
where
it
is
entertainment.
the
state
tax
--
the
state
may
outlaw
serving
of
liquor
by
the
drink
and
that
may
really
outlaw
any
cabaret
with
entertainment
because
there's
no
economic
way
to
run
one.
all
states
of
course,
make
it
illegal
to
sell
certain
kinds
of
securities
or
unapproved
securities.
yet,
the
federal
tax
supplies
equally,
stamp
transfer
tax
on
a
sale
of
any
security
legal
or
illegal.
the
sale
of
theater
tickets
is
until
recently
for
many
years
have
been
taxed
by
congress
and
yet,
if
a
man
is
a
scalper
of
tickets
without
a
license
in
the
state
of
new
york
where
you
got
be
licensed
to
be
a
scalper.
he
can't
say
i
don't
--
i
won't,
i'm
exempted
from
the
federal
tax,
i
submit.
he
doesn't
get
an
exemption
from
the
payment
of
the
tax.
just
how
much
information,
he
must
report
whether
he
must
register,
if
there's
a
registration
provision.
how
much
detail
he
must
give
whether
he
has
filed
a
return
that
says,
this
is
x
or
y
kind
of
tax.
he's
not
involved
in
this
case.
the
income
tax
problem
is
really
not
all
the
different,
all
completely
different
from
this.
i
submit
that
accepting
the
provisions
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
raise
serious
questions
with
the
income
tax.
if
a
man
is
a
bank
employee
and
has
for
many
years
earned
$5000
a
year
which
is
reported
to
him
on
his
w2
return.
he
staples
that
on
his
return
and
he
files
it
every
year.
then
one
year
he
embezzles
$500,000
from
his
bank.
he
might
well
say,
do
i
have
to
put
this
down
on
my
return?
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
even
as
miscellaneous
income
of
$500,000,
if
he's
--
if
he
is
indicted
for
embezzlement.
if
he's
indicted
for
embezzlement
and
this
return
is
introduced
against
him.
it's
one
link
in
the
evidence.
he's
the
only
of
the
40
employees
in
the
bank
that
had
$500,000
worth
of
miscellaneous
income,
the
same
year
that
the
bank
showed
up
missing
$500,000.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
well
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
that's
a
very
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
was
that
set
it
in
court?
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
let
me
try
to
answer
at
that
way.
you
can
answer
that
question,
“yes,
he's
entitled
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
answer
that
question.”
we
can
answer
--
we
could
both
assume
arguendo
for
this
case
that
he
could
decline
that
information
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
without
deciding
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
am
not
sure
if
it's
my
place
to
concede
that
he
could.
i've
got
pretty
good
personal
ideas
to
whether
he
could
or
not.
but
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
i
may
and
i'm
going
to
try
to
answer
your
question
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
the
federal
internal
revenue
code
does
require
you
to
state
on
your
income
tax
return
the
source
of
your
income.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
it
doesn't
say
in
a
general
way.
it's
pretty
clear,
the
source
of
your
income.
i
think
you
--
it
further
requires
that
if
you're
in
the
business
of
gambling.
in
the
business
of
gambling
that
you
file
a
schedule
c
which
is
a
long
schedule
state
the
nature
of
your
business,
state
the
gross
income,
identify
each
expense,
that's
required
by
the
internal
revenue
code.
as
i
read
it
and
i
think
--
i
think
as
anyone
would
read
it,
it's
required.
and
there
is
a
crime,
willful
failure
to
supply
adequate
information
or
required
information
on
the
return.
now,
if
a
gambler
filed
a
return
and
all
he
put
on
was
miscellaneous
income,
$300,000
and
he
declined
to
supply
any
of
this
other
information.
and
he
was
indicted
for
failure
to
supply
necessary
information
which
i
state
again
is
a
separate
crime.
not
failure
to
pay
but
failure
to
supply
information.
he'd
reported
all
his
income
but
he
didn't
tell
where
it
came
from,
as
he's
required
by
law
to
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
then
he
could
say
the
fifth
amendment
excuses
me
from
supplying
all
this
information
but
it
doesn't
excuse
me
from
paying.
and
if
that
was
this
case
then
i
would
be
here
arguing
about
whether
he
has
to
supply
the
information,
but
i'm
not.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
you
did
it
intentionally,
willfully.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
must
speak
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
must
respectfully
disagree.
you
would
be
guilty
of
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
when
this
court
has
the
question
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
you
could
and
it
wouldn't
be
willful
failure
file
because
he
filed
a
return
under
the
hypothetical
mr.
justice
stewart
has
said.
and
it
wouldn't
be
will
--
willful
failure
to
pay,
it
would
only
be
willful
failure
to
supply
required
information
or
willful
misstatement
of
required
information
which
is
about
the
same
thing.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
gets
to
that
in
the
final
analysis.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
it's
not
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
all
i
can
say
is
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
not
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
and
in
this
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
if
pressed
to
answer,
how
i
would
--
what
i
would
say
if
i
had
willful
failure
to
supply
necessary
information
in
this
case.
i
would
answer,
no,
its
different.
it's
not
--
it's
not
simple.
it's
not
that
simple.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
the
reason
that
the
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
don't
think
the
government
very
often
indicts
a
person
for
willful
failure
to
supply
information
when
he
says,
the
reason
i
didn't
supplied
it
was
because
i've
have
a
fifth
amendment
right.
i
paid
my
tax
and
now
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
where
i
got
the
money.
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
involving
that
questions
being
indicted.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
there's
very
clearly
a
difference
in
requiring
a
man
to
pay
a
tax
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i'm
not
saying
they
must
stop.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
i
don't
have
any
answer
whether
they
must
stop
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
case
because
this
is
the
question
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
whether
a
man
must
pay
a
tax.
not
file
a
return
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
not
supply
all
the
information
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
in
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that
would
be
the
issue
in
that
case.
it's,
it's
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
submit
that
when
this
court
spent
close
to
a
hundred
pages
of
its
decisions,
a
hundred
pages
of
its
reports
within
recent
years
in
writing,
the
james
and
the
rutkin
cases
involving
the
taxability
of
income
from
extortion
and
embezzlement.
and
those
were
hard
fought
cases
and
when
this
court
finally
decided
that
that
income
was
taxable,
i
submit
that
this
court
wasn't
engaging
in
an
exercise
in
futility
as
it
would
be
if
a
man
didn't
have
to
report
illegal
income
because
that
information
might
be
used
against
him.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
if
he
had
paid
the
tax
and
filed
the
730
return
which
says,
payment
of
excise
tax
on
gambling
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
they
would
disclose
the
730.
if
he
had
sent
in
a
check
which
and
said
along
with
it.
this
is
in
payment
of
an
excise
tax
and
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
which
one
but
its
an
excise
tax
of
some
kind
of
which
there
are
hundreds
or
he
had
--
instead
of
filling
the
730,
the
gambling
excise
tax
return,
he
had
filed
a
general
excise
tax
return
which
has
all
sorts
of
boxes
to
check
and
he
didn't
check
any.
they
wouldn't
have
been
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
there's
nothing
in
the
statutes
on
that.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
there's
nothing
in
the
statutes
which
prohibits
the
government
from
making
any
such
information
available
to
the
states.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
which
authorize
it.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
obvious
as
we
both
recognize
that
once
the
government
has
collected
its
income
and
there
has
been
disclosed
to
the
government
a
violation
of
a
state
law.
the
federal
government
doesn't
consider
that
it
must
unless
congress
or
this
court
tells
it
to
keep
that
information
secret.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
it's
well
recognized.
it's
just
a
certain
degree
of
cooperation
which
i
think
we
--
many
people
laud
between
–
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
state
and
federal
law
enforcement.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
oh,
they
don't
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
it
had
certainly
a
substantial
reason.
i
do
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
could
make
--
i
could
think
of
many
other
reasons
perhaps
this
state
has
a
tax
on
the
income
--
an
income
tax
anyone
had
checked
his
gross
income.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
can
think
of
no
other
reason.
now,
what
i
have
said
here
is,
this
man
cannot
excuse
his
failure
to
pay
the
tax
because
he
wants
to
excuse
his
failure
to
file
a
return.
if
he'd
been
indicted
and
tried
and
convicted
in
appeal
to
this
court
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
file
a
form
730.
i
would
probably
come
in
here
and
defend
the
government
on
that
point.
but
this
court
might
reach
a
very
much
different
result.
i
can't
predict
what
would
happen
in
that
case.
the
question
is
whether
he
has
to
pay
the
tax?
and
he
could
have
paid
it
by
filing
a
general
excise
tax
return
or
by
sending
a
letter
saying,
this
is
for
excise
taxes.
by
doing
that
he
would
have
violated
apparently
the
requirements
of
the
statutes.
but
he
had
to
have
a
very
solid
defense,
fifth
amendment
for
that.
just
as
gamblers
have
for
many
years
and
virtually
everyone
who
engages
in
illegal
activities
have
for
many
years
known
that
they
could
report
under
income
tax
return,
miscellaneous
income.
the
statute
requires
them
to
file
extensive
forms
schedule
c
which
is
a
very
extensive
form
if
you're
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
and
make
many
disclosures
about
your
trade
or
business,
but
they
don't.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes.
any
trade
or
business
including
gambling
or
--
or
operating
a
bucket
shop
or
anything
else.
but
they
don't
do
that
if
its
illegal
income.
they
put
it
down
as
miscellaneous
and
they
say
if
the
federal
government
says,
where
is
your
schedule
c?
they
say,
fifth
amendment.
and
i
think
this
case
goes
well
beyond
all
those
other
cases.
this
is
the
failure
to
pay
case.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
thank
you
very
much.
i
submit
that
the
federal
government
does
not
have
a
constitutional
obligation
to
excuse
a
person
from
paying
a
tax
because
he's
engaged
in
an
illegal
business.
be
it
an
excise
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i'd
like
to
answer
that
into
two
steps.
the
first
of
which
you
will
not
consider
a
complete
answer
but
i'll
move
to
what
i
think
is
a
complete
answer.
the
first
step
is
that
federal
government
does
impart.
it
imposes
a
tax
on
the
sale
of
jewelry,
furs
and
many
other
items
and
that's
whether
they're
legal
or
illegal.
and
i,
i
submit
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
alright.
my
second
answer
is
even
if
this
was
a
tax
on
nearly
the
sale
of
stolen
jewelry
and
furs
and
nothing
more.
then,
i
would
come
in
here
and
defend
that
tax
in
the
same
way.
whether
you'd
reach
the
same
result
or
not
that
i
don't
know
as
you
will
in
this
case.
but
what
i
would
answer
is
if
that
was
one
of
200
excise
taxes,
he
could
send
in
a
check
for
payment
and
say,
this
is
for
an
excise
tax
and
i
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
tell
you
which
one.
and
he
will
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
don't
see
why
he
isn't.
why
not?
if
he
were
indicted
for
a
failure
to
file
the
proper
return
and
he
had
appealed
to
this
court
from
that,
he
would
have
a
much
different
argument,
and
he
might
well
have
a
proper
fifth
amendment
argument
that
he
didn't
have
to
file
the
return.
and
that
conviction
would
be
overturned.
possibly,
i
don't
concede
it
here.
i
don't
have
to.
but
what
i
say
is
this
is
failure
to
pay
and
there
is
not
great
difference,
i
don't
think,
between
a
tax
on
gambling,
and
jewelry,
and
furs,
and
radios,
and
television
sets,
and
liquor
--
liquor
from
an
illegal
distiller
that
might
have
been
under
that
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
as,
as
i
submit,
the
government
had
a
perfect
right
to
do.
we
did
indict
him
for
failure
to
file
a
return.
and
i
submit
that
if
after
today,
he
continues
to
engage
or
someone
continues
to
engage
in
the
business
of
gambling,
let
him
pay
his
tax.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
take
a
check
and
put
it
in
an
envelop
and
put
in
a
letter
perhaps
that
said,
this
is
in
payment
of
an
excise
tax.
or
possibly
he
could
file
a
return
instead
of
a
730,
file
a
return
like
this.
a
720
which
says,
excise
tax
as
in
general,
as
you
can
see
it's
close
to
the
payment
for
excise
taxes.
and
here
where
it
says,
which
one?
and
check
the
right
box.
he
says,
i
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
check
the
correct
box.
but
to
exempt
him
from
the
payment
of
this
excise
tax,
what
it
seems
to
me
goes
substantially
beyond
just
as
simple
gambling
tax.
difficult
i
think
to
distinguish
between
that
and
the
payment
of
income
taxes.
counsel
for
both
petitioners
here
have
said,
“oh,
we
concede
our
people
have
to
pay
income
taxes
on
their
gambling
business.”
well,
i
don't
really
see
the
distinction
if
they're
indicted
for
gambling
in
a
state
and
somebody
puts
in
an
income
tax
returns
as
miscellaneous,
$800,000
income
last
year
and
then
the
state
introduced
its
evidence
which
tends
to
show
that
they
had
no
other
--
no
gainful
occupation
of
any
kind
except
their
connection
with
various
bookmakers,
et
cetera.
i
think
that
that
would
certainly
be
a
link
in
the
chain
and
i
want
to
read
you
just
one
sentence.
one
sentence
out
of
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
grosso
case.
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
different
than,
than
what
the
counsel
said
on
oral
argument.
he
said
this,
“it
is
petitioner's
position
that
he
is
protected
as
fully
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
when
the
government
seeks
the
information
connection
with
collection
of
a
tax
as
if
the
government
would
seek
the
information
by
asking
him
the
question
before
a
grand
jury.”
can
you
imagine
putting
a
gambler
on
the
stand
and
saying
to
him,
how
much
income
did
you
have
last
year
from
sources
other
than
interest,
dividends,
salary,
annuities,
pension
plans,
et
cetera,
the
various
items
on
the
return?
now
that,
how
much
miscellaneous
income
did
you
have
last
year?
he'd
say,
he
takes
the
fifth
amendment.
he
doesn't
have
to
testify
to
that
before
a
grand
jury.
i'm
sure.
so
that
if
what
counsel
is
arguing
for
is
that
--
that
the
grand
jury
standard
applies
to
the
payment
of
a
tax.
i
think
this
is
a
very
sweeping
doctrine
and
one
that
gives
me
substantial
cause.
since,
since
my
time
is
up,
i
would
like
to
say
just
two
things
very
briefly.
if
this
court
for
any
reason
which
i
can't
conceive
of,
rejects
my
principal
argument
and
holds
that
a
man
doesn't
have
to
pay
a
tax
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
say,
i
don't
think
he
would.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
because
he
have
to
pay
an
income
tax
on
his
miscellaneous
income
or
can
he
exclude
all
of
his
income
from
gambling
because
he
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
that.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
the
income
tax,
that's
right.
the
income
tax
on
gambling,
but
petitioners
here
say,
we
don't
--
we
concede
that
we
have
to
pay
our
income
tax.
i
think
that
wholly
inconsistent
with
their
position.
if
they've
got
to
pay
an
income
tax,
they've
got
to
pay
an
excise
tax.
they
don't
have
to.
i
think
they
will
probably
have
a
constitutional
right
and
again,
i
say,
i
don't
concede
these
points
for
the
government.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
may
well
have
a
constitutional
right
on
their
income
tax
return
not
to
file
a
schedule
c
that
says
we're
in
the
business
of
gambling.
but
to
put
down
one
figure,
miscellaneous
income,
$200,000,
and
i
submit
that
they
can
do
the
same
thing
with
the
excise
tax,
enclose
a
check
in
an
envelop
with
a
general
excise
tax
return
or
even
with
a
letter
that
says,
this
is
for
excise
taxes.
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
say
one
word
first
though,
if
for
any
reason
you
were
to
reject
the
argument
and
find
that
you
don't
have
to
pay
a
tax.
well,
then
i
agree
with
the
use
of
restriction
argument
enunciated
by
my
colleague
here.
the
same
thing
is
true
here
that
the
result
would
be
what
the
government
collects
the
tax
but
to
restrict
to
use
on
a
jury
trial
point.
i
would
say
that
it's
quite
clear
what
happened
here
after
approximately
one
day
of
deliberation,
the
judge
received
a
note.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
note
said,
although
the
note
was
note
reserved,
the
note
said,
“we
are
unable
to
agree
what
should
we
do?”
now,
the
judge
testified
to
that,
the
judge
explained
that
a
short
time
later.
the
judge
then
said
to
the
bailiff,
“tell
them
to
continue
deliberating.”
the
record
also
has
the
judge's
statement
that
that's
why
i
told
the
bailiff
to
tell
them.
within
45
minutes
after
that
communication
to
the
jury,
the
defense
counsel
learned
about
the
incident.
he
did
not
at
that
time
say,
let's
preserve
the
note.
i'm
sure
the
note
was
still
in
existence
within
45
minutes.
he
did
not
at
that
time
say,
let's
put
the
bailiff
understand
and
ask
him,
bring
the
bailiff
in.
put
him
under
oath
and
ask
him,
what
did
you
tell
the
jury?
he
didn't
suggest
any
of
those
procedures.
what
he
did
is
he
waited,
and
two
days
later,
while
the
jury
was
still
deliberating.
the
jury
deliberations
having
been
interrupted
for
a
day-and-a-half
because
of
the
illness
of
a
juror
but
when
the
jury
got
back
to
deliberate
and
again,
they
send
exactly
the
same
note
to
the
judge,
said,
“we
are
enable
to
agree,
what
should
we
do?”
and
the
judge
looked
at
and
said,
“this
is
about
the
same
note
that
i
got
the
first
time
substantially
exactly
the
same.”
and
then
he
turned
to
the
bailiff,
this
was
in
the
presence
of
both
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
and
he
turned
to
the
bailiff
and
he
said,
“tell
them
to
continue
deliberating.”
the
same
thing
he
told
them
the
first
time.
the
bailiff
turned
around
and
he
walked
out,
and
the
defense
counsel
didn't
say
nor
the
defendant
jump
up
and
say,
wait
a
minute,
bring
the
jury
in
and
let's
do
it
all
in
an
open
court.
he
had
no
objection
at
that
time
neither
the
defendant
nor
his
counsel
to
the
bailiff
going
out
and
saying,
telling
the
jury
to
continue
deliberating.
the
bailiff
had
spent
something
like
three-and-a-half
days
with
this
jury
shepherding
him
from
hotel,
to
court,
to
lunch,
and
so
forth.
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
talk
to
the
jury
if
he
wanted
to
about
this
case
and
to
prejudice
their
deliberations
and
certainly,
the
fact
that
we
was
told
--
go
in
and
tell
them
to
continue
deliberating,
didn't
give
him
any
great
opportunity
to
step
in
there
and
do
anything.
moreover,
one
more
point,
during
the
course
of
this
jury
deliberation
which
took
place
after
approximately
a
six-week
trial,
a
doctor
was
called
to
minister
to
one
of
the
jurors
who
would
become
ill.
the
defense
attorney
said,
“oh,
no
wait
a
minute,
what
went
on
here?
how
long
was
this
one
juror
was
separate
from
the
other
jurors
and
is
he
in
shape
to
testify
and
so
forth.”
and
the
judge
at
the
time
called
in
at
least
three
people
who
were
in
contact
with
the
jury.
he
called
in
his
clerk,
he
called
in
the
chief
marshall,
and
he
called
in
the
deputy
marshall,
and
they
were
put
there
and
examined
on
what
it
happened
here.
now,
i
submit
that
if
the
defense
counsel
had
wanted
to
ask
the
bailiff
who
had
been
told,
go
tell
the
jury
to
continue
deliberating.
did
you
tell
them
anything
else
what
did
you
say?
the
bailiff
was
in
and
out
of
this
room.
the
record
shows
that
the
bailiff
was
in
and
out
of
the
room
where
counsel
and
the
judge
were
present
a
number
of
times
at
least
ones
or
twice.
and
he
could
have
at
anytime
said,
put
the
bailiff
on
the
stand.
just
like
you
did
with
the
clerk,
the
chief
marshall,
and
the
deputy
chief
marshall,
he
didn't
it.
nor
did
he
object
to
the
second
time
this
incident
was
repeated.
note
followed
by
an
oral
discussion,
an
oral
instruction
to
go
tell
the
jury
to
continue
to
deliberating.
what
happened
was?
he
waited
until
the
jury
brought
in
the
verdict.
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
said,
“where's
the
note?”
where's
the
note?
he
said,
well,
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
the
note,
it's
five
days
ago.
he
said,
“well,
how
do
i
know
what
the
bailiff
said?”
this,
this
all
happened
five
days
later.
i
submit
that
if
this
court
reverses
in
this
--
for
this
error
that
petitioner
will
probably
have
the
best
odds
he's
ever
had
in
his
life
because
what
will
happen
is
he
could
have
sat
there
quietly
and
if
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
he
was
off
for
good.
and
if
the
verdict
--
if
they
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no,
i
can't
your
honor.
i
think
that
i
can't
give
you
a
capsule
answer.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony
put
in
because
this
case
concerned
failure
to
pay
--
oh,
i
can't
answer
that
question.
let
me
do
this.
the
case
concerned
failure
to
pay
the
gambling
tax
over
a
very
long
period
something
like
three
years.
now,
the
record
does
contain
evidence
that
in
a
one
week
period
in
february
of
1959,
i
believe
it
was.
this
gambling
operation
that
defendant
was
convicted
of
--
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
being
a
part
off,
took
in
a
gross
amount
of
$250,000
in
a
one
week
period.
now,
the
scope
and
size
of
that
operation
as
indicated
by
that
evidence,
i
think
might
account
for
the
fact
that
he
was
indicted
for
failure
to
pay
his
tax
over
a
three-year
period
that
the
government
had
to
bring
in
a
large
amount
of
testimony
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
know
the
defendant
took
the
stand
and
testified
extensively.
he
testified
a
great
of
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
they
offered
testimony
from
agents
who
had
been
engaged
in
a
raid
on
his
operations,
people
who
had
been
connected
with
his
operations,
and
the
usual
type
of
testimony
that
comes
in
and
would
permit
to
an
income
tax
of
a
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
there's
no
doubt
but
that
the
question
of
whether
engaged
in
gambling
came
into
it.
his
defense
incidentally
your
honor
was,
i
was
a
gambler
until
1951.
then
i
learned
about
this
federal
tax
and
so
then
i
give
the
whole
operation
to
my
brother
and
i
think
this
is
associated
with
it
ever
since
then.
i'm
not
connected
with
the
operation.
and
you
can
imagine
that
there
would
be
a
large
number
of
witnesses
about
his
--
about
his
activities.
he
testified
himself
that
he
was
not
in
a
business
of
being
a
gambler
but
he
gambled.
this
federal
tax
don't
forget
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
no,
i
don't
know.
he
testified
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
it's
a
very
long
record
your
honor
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
--
and
we
haven't
reproduce
the
whole
thing
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
well,
certainly
we
can
make
the
entire
record
available,
if
it
isn't
already.
i'm
sure
it
is
in
the
clerk's
office.
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony
in
addition
on
his
own
gambling
activities.
he
testified,
he
made
$50,000
a
year
net
from
nine
business
gambling.
in
other
words,
friendly
card
games,
race
tracks,
et
cetera
but
his
defense
was,
he
wasn't
in
the
business
of
gambling.
he
didn't
run
an
organized
gambling
operation
and
the
federal
tax
didn't
applied
to
that.
and
virtually
all
of
the
people
who
were
not
privileged
and
who
were
not
also
codefendants
or
co-indictees
were
called
to
the
stand
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
i
think
there
were
two
or
three
others
who
indicted
with
him.
two
or
three
others
were
indicted
with
him
but
--
and
it
was
--
mr.
james
e.
mclaughlin
thank
you
sir.
sorry
it
takes
much
time.
