mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
of
the
issue
as
presented
by
number
181
carries
on
the
inquiry
the
court
has
been
making
yesterday
afternoon
and
today
about
wagering
taxes.
my
client
is
convicted
on
20
counts
for
involving
the
occupational
tax
and
wagers
and
16
involving
the
excise
tax
and
wagers.
he
was
sentenced
by
judge
foley
to
nine
years,
the
fine
of
$191,000
for
these
violations.
i'd
suppose
that
our
case
differed
from
marchetti
and
that
with
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
point
we
are
attacking
only
the
excise
tax
counts.
we're
not
attacking
here
the
occupational
tax
count.
and
in
our
submission,
the
excise
tax
is
invalid
whatever
maybe
the
disposition
of
kahriger
and
lewis
in
the
occupational
tax
because
of
our
reading
in
kahriger
and
lewis
is
turning
on
the
fact
that
the
occupational
tax
looks
to
future
acts
while
the
excise
tax
unequivocally
looks
to
the
past.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
my
record
i
can't.
the
record
was
not
made
in
the
trial
court
at
the
time
this
indictment
came
down
before
albertson,
before
i
believe
malloy,
there
was
no
reason
to
think
the
court
might
overrule
kahriger
and
so
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
whereas
it
--
it
had
been
raised
below.
i
assure
you
sir
that
we
would
be
attacking
it
also.
we
think
that
the
perspective
nature
of
the
occupational
tax
was
the
basis
of
kahriger
but
i
understand
mr.
beytagh
arguing
for
the
united
states
a
few
moments
ago,
to
say
that
the
united
states
does
not
rest
on
that
as
a
justification
of
kahriger-lewis
cases
and
he
puts
the
argument
now
as
--
as
an
understanding
on
the
thought
which
is
voiced
primarily
in
lewis
case
of
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
testimony
which
is
required
that
since
the
person
may
get
out
of
the
gambling
business.
he
is
under
no
compulsion
to
gamble,
therefore
under
no
compulsion
to
pay
tax
on
gambling.
now,
this
line
of
argument
of
course,
would
apply
as
much
to
the
excise
tax
as
it
does
to
the
occupational
tax
and
i've
--
we'll
get
back
and
--
and
comment
on
that
in
a
moment
but
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
question
which
the
chief
justice
put
yesterday
afternoon
to
mr.
zeldes
in
which
he
inquired
about
a
hypothetical
federal
tax
on
bucket
shops
whether
that
would
raise
the
same
problems
as
are
involved
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
chief
justice's
question
was
susceptible
of
two
readings.
if
the
tax,
the
chief
justice
had
in
mind
was
a
tax
specifically
on
the
occupation
of
running
a
bucket
shop
then
my
answer
would
be
the
same
as
mr.
zeldes
gave.
i
would
find
it
quiet
indistinguishable
from
the
taxes
we
have
here.
but
i
think
that
perhaps
what
the
chief
justice
had
in
mind
was
a
different
kind
of
tax.
a
federal
tax,
let
us
say,
when
every
person
engaged
in
the
securities
business
and
someone
so
engaged
refuses
to
pay
up
because
he
is
in
fact
running
a
bucket
shop
and
the
form
saying
that
he
is
in
the
securities
business
might
be
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
that
would
convict
him.
i
think
that
the
--
if
--
if
that
is
the
question
the
chief
justice
intended,
it
raises
extremely
important
and
interesting
problems
as
to
the
basic
theory
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
specifically,
what
kinds
of
compelled
testimony
are
incriminating.
now,
the
test
announced
by
this
court
in
the
hoffman
case
and
that
quoted
many
times
since
has
been
linked
in
a
chain.
but
i'm
perfectly
confident,
but
the
courts
never
supposed
that
an
important
and
settled
constitutional
principle
can
be
expressed
in
a
forcible
phrase.
if
one
goes
back
to
hoffman
itself,
though
the
link
in
the
chain
language
is
used.
the
court
also
speaks
of
working
to
the
implications
of
the
question,
the
setting
in
which
it
is
asked,
the
background
and
the
peculiarities
of
the
case.
i
cannot
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
extends
protection
to
any
statement
which
might
be
admissible
in
evidence
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
think
that,
if
link
in
the
chain
is
given
with
that
broad
a
reading
that
there
is
the
same
difficulty
that
professor
henry
had
observed
of
the
outcome
determined
of
test
to
guarantee
trust
that
there
is
no
logical
stopping
place.
there
is
virtually
nothing
that
a
person
could
not
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
it
is
incriminating.
i'm
personally
aware
of
the
case
in
the
utah
state
court,
some
five
years
ago
in
which
a
person
claimed
the
privilege
when
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
plaintiff
with
erwin
n.
griswold.
and
my
mind
boggles
that
the
notion
could
be
possibly
be
incriminating
to
be
acquainted
with
griswold.
and
i
think
that
here
the
key
is,
to
look
as
hoffman
says
and
i
think
albertson
now
develops
the
theory
further
to
look
at
the
point
at
which
the
inquiry
is
made,
the
circumstances
in
which
it
is
made.
i
think
that
this
is
the
reason
why
the
government
concedes
that
the
sullivan
case
does
not
control
here.
it
is
true
that
one
reporting
income
tax
conceivably
could
report
something
which
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
in
a
later
case.
income
tax
returns
have
come
in
and
in
some
kinds
of
litigation.
but
as
we
said
in
--
in
albertson,
the
questions
are
neutral
in
there
face
and
they're
directed
to
the
public
at
large.
the
risk
of
incrimination
is
here
a
minimal
risk.
we
go
to
the
other
extreme,
you
have
a
person
who
has
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
some
investigative
body
and
here
a
question
which
addressed
to
the
world
generally
might
be
neutral
and
non-incriminating
because
of
the
setting
takes
on
a
much
more
sinister
cast.
and
in
my
submission,
what
the
fifth
amendment
really
protects
is
against
a
person
being
compelled
to
give
any
testimony
which
will
have
a
substantial
effect
of
accusing
himself
of
the
crime.
now
on
that
analysis,
i
return
to
the
bucket
shop
case
which
provoked
it.
if
the
federal
tax
in
question
whereas
i
understood
the
chief
justice
to
suggest
a
general
tax
then
i
would
say
that
there
would
not
be
a
constitutional
privilege.
that
the
likelihood
of
incrimination
and
asking
people
to
say
that
i
am
engaged
in
the
securities
business
is
very
small
and
that
even
for
the
bucket
shop
operator,
this
would
be
such
a
very
small
part
of
the
case
against
him.
the
government's
case
would
require
much
more
than
that
and
this
i
think
would
really
be
insignificant.
i
deal
in
the
same
way
with
the
example
that
the
united
states
puts
in
its
brief,
can
a
person
refuse
to
pay
real
estate
taxes
because
of
the
property
which
he
owns
is
being
used
for
purposes
of
prostitution.
and
as
the
government
points
out,
if
you
have
a
person
who
is
himself
being
charged
with
prostitution
and
he's
asked,
“do
you
own
this
property?”
then
you
have
i
think
a
very
substantial
link
in
the
chain.
but
if
you
simply
ask
the
whole
world
to
come
forward
and
pay
real
estate
taxes
on
the
property
they
own,
i
think
that
you
come
again
on
the
language
of
albertson,
the
requirement
is
neutral
on
its
face
and
directed
at
the
public
at
large.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
submission,
the
gambling
business
is
much
more
like
the
business
of
receiving
stolen
property
than
it
is
like
the
securities
business.
i
recognized
of
course,
the
point
that
you
make
with
here
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
find
it
inconceivable
than
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
any
state
would.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
to
me
with
respect
sir,
it
does
not.
i've
done
--
so
far
as
the
power
of
congress
to
tax
is
concerned,
we
think
the
congress
has
the
power
to
lay
an
excise
tax
in
any
business
whatever
even
if
it
is
as
receiving
stolen
goods
illegal
in
every
state.
in
the
enforcement
of
such
a
tax,
i
think
that
the
congress
is
constitutionally
required
to
observe
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
though,
it
may
have
other
techniques
available
for
enforcement,
it
cannot
ask
the
law
breaker
himself
to
come
forward
and
confess
his
sins.
on
the
point
of
voluntariness
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
i
think
so
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
there
are
several
ways
that
you
could
enforce
payment
of
the
tax
without
requiring
but
mr.
justice
black,
years
ago
called
“the
squeezing
device”.
one
would
be
to
--
for
the
congress
to
enact
a
genuinely
workable
immunity
provision.
the
congress
in
many
other
instances
where
it
is
wanted
information
has
provided
for
immunity,
it
could
do
so
here.
what
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
would
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
think
the
criminal
sanction
for
nonpayment
of
the
tax
is
improper.
provided
that
there
is
some
way
that
it
can
be
paid
without
the
taxpayer
incriminating
himself.
the
government
has
assumes
arguendo
in
its
brief
what
we
have
argued
specifically
with
regard
to
these
gambling
taxes
that
it
is
not
possible
to
pay
the
tax
without
identifying
yourself
as
having
received
wagers
in
the
preceding
month.
but
i
--
i
think
that
there
--
the
immunity
statute
i
proposed
is
not
the
only
way
congress
can
enforce
such
a
tax.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
no,
i
--
i
do
not
think
i'm
saying
that
at
all.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
suggesting
sir,
that
if
the
congress
gives
immunity
and
provides
that
the
fact
of
payment
may
not
be
used
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
pardon?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
immunity
either
from
use
as
evidence
or
from
use
as
an
investigatory
relief,
if
in
other
words,
it
creates
an
immunity
broad
enough
to
meet
the
test
of
counselman
v.
hitchcock
and
all
the
wager
cases,
then
i
think
the
person
who
does
not
pay
maybe
prosecuted
for
nonpayment.
the
problem
here
is
that
you
cannot
pay
without
self-accusation.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest
that
you
would
do
very
much
what
the
government
has
proposed
and
what
this
court
did
essentially
in
murphy,
it
would
put
the
burden
on
the
prosecution
to
establish
that
they
had
obtained
all
their
evidence
free
from
anything.
now,
i
personally
believe
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
should
think
that
you
would
have
to
so
hold
if
you
were
to
invent
such
an
immunity
in
order
for
it,
to
survive
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
thought
so.
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
that
comes
up
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
albertson
itself,
the
court
describes
the
evidence
or
investigatory
lead
as
the
measure
of
what
must
be
done
if
immunity
is
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
i'm
suggesting
one.
i
of
course,
do
not
think
it
all
but
it
would
be
right
for
this
court
as
the
government
suggests
to
invent
such
a
rule.
i
think
this
would
raise
the
very
gravest
questions
of
separations
of
powers
and
if
this
is
particularly
the
kind
of
question
which
the
congress
is
much
better
equipped
to
decide
than
is
this
court.
the
congress
can
find
out
the
facts
as
to
whether
the
tax
can
ever
be
enforceable,
whether
the
revenues
will
produce
or
worth
it
and
i
would
think
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that's
a
very
different
case
because
there
at
the
state,
those
legislative
branch
had
undertaken
to
provide
immunity
and
the
question
was
how
this
could
be
made
effective
in
our
dual
federalism
system.
and
i
--
i
think
the
court
really
had
very
little
recourse
there
except
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
it
was
an
alternative
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
agree.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
excuse
me.
i
agree
mr.
justice
white.
the
court
could
have
waited
but
it
seems
to
me
a
much
less
step
if
the
court
took
there
where
at
least
the
state
of
new
jersey
had
undertaken
so
far
as
it
could
to
give
immunity.
then
it
would
be
here
where
there
is
no
indication
whatever
that
congress
wanted
to
provide
in
the
immunity.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
arises
in
my
submission
because
it
is
more
properly
to
the
branch
of
the
government
that
makes
laws
to
decide
whether
it
wants
to
obtain
testimony
at
the
price
of
making
various
evidence
unavailable
to
federal
and
state
authorities.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
there
you
at
least
had
a
legislative
branch
that
had
said
we
want
this
enough,if
we're
going
to
give
as
much
immunity
as
we
can
in
order
to
get
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
that
is
right.
and
this
court
said,
we'll
cooperate
with
the
state
and
keep
the
evidence
out
for
the
federal
purposes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
difference
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
is
that
in
the
(inaudible)
fashion,
the
fruit
of
poison
tree,
search
and
seizure,
this
is
the
only
remedy
that
can
be
provided.
the
violation
has
already
taken
place
and
this
court
has
fashioned,
what
is
now
a
constitutional
rule
of
exclusion.
but
here
we
are
back
a
step
earlier
in
the
process.
here
the
man
has
not
yet
been
compelled
to
say
anything
and
the
question
is,
should
he
be
compelled
to
speak
out?
and
then
later
we'll
provide
some
remedy
for
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
find
it
very
different.
in
the
cases
that
you
speak
of
sir,
these
are
--
the
problem
is
how
you
administer
justice
in
the
federal
courts
or
as
--
as
you
have
now
expand
to
it
and
the
courts
throughout
the
united
states
generally.
what
the
government
is
suggesting
here
however,
on
the
assumption
which
they
make
in
there
alternative
argument
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
here
applicable.
they
are
saying
that
you
should
bail
out
the
congress
that
the
--
you
should
make
the
statute
enforceable
so
that
the
congress
can
get
a
hundred
million
dollars
in
15
years.
even
though
the
congress
didn't
do
this
itself
insofar
as
the
congress
showed
an
intent,
the
congress
said
“we
don't
want
this
kept
secret.
we
want
the
occupational
tax
list
to
be
public.
we
don't
want
any
immunity
all
to
be
granted.”
my
time
is
very
short
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
second
issue,
the
case
involves.
but
i'm
fearful
that
if
i
do
not
get
to
it,
it
would
seem
to
suggest
that
we
agree
with
the
unimportance
the
united
states
attaches
to
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
it,
it
is
not.
but
as
the
united
states
is
conceded
in
its
brief,
they
are
made
available
to
state
prosecuting
authorities
and
people
have
been
convicted
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
this
i,
i
know
but
the
united
states
says
in
its
brief
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there's
no
secrecy
provision
on
the
statute
to
the
regulations
with
regard
to
them.
there's
no
provision
expressly
requiring
the
disclosure
as
there
is
with
the
occupational
tax.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
remain
persuaded
mr.
justice
black
that
these
questions
of
secrecy
or
disclosure
are
congressional
questions
and
not
judicial
questions,
i
don't
regard
that
issue
as
essential
to
my
case
because
it
seems
to
me
even
if
the
court
were
to
do
what
united
states
suggests
that
it
would
be
unthinkable
that
this
conviction
could
be
affirmed
that
this
taxpayer
could
be
expected
to
have
anticipated
in
1961
to
the
1967,
the
court
will
provide
some
form
of
protection
so
that
what
he
said
would
not
incriminate.
and
so
i
would
think
the
reversal
on
this
case
would
be
required
in
any
event
and
that
is
of
course
all
that
i
entitled
to
argue
for
here.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
a
bit
of
extra
time
then
before
i
turn
to
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
let
me
say
a
word
of
voluntariness
since
the
government
has
argued
that
with
such
vigor,
i
would
have
thought
that
albertson
was
enough
as
a
matter
of
precedent
to
refute
the
voluntariness
argument
because
albertson
was
under
no
more
compulsion
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
when
my
client
is
to
be
a
gambler.
he
had
a
free
choice.
nevertheless,
the
court
said
that
the
registration
provision
would
violate
the
privileges
against
him.
and
if
the
argument
be
put
not
on
precedent
but
on
principle,
the
government's
argument,
i
submit
would
be
destructive
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it
is
hard
to
think
of
any
incriminating
testimony
about
which
it
could
not
be
said
well,
if
you
didn't
have
to
commit
that
crime.
you
voluntarily
chose
to
violate
the
man
act
to
commit
a
burglary
or
whatever
it
is
you
did.
therefore
since
you
did
it
voluntarily
we're
not
compelling
you
now
to
be
a
witness
against
yourself,
your
own
acts
what's
got
you
into
it.
i
think
that
the
voluntariness
concept
would
truly
put
a
man
to
the
fifth
amendment
as
we've
known
it
throughout
our
history.
on
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
the
facts
very
briefly
that
while
the
jury
was
out
deliberating,
it
send
a
note
to
the
judge
in
the
absence
of
petitioner
and
his
counsel.
the
judge
then
sent
an
oral
instruction
through
the
bailiff
in
the
absence
of
petitioner
and
his
counsel
to
the
jury.
this
was
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
obvious
error.
an
obvious
error
it
is
under
the
line
of
decisions
here
which
go
back
to
1894
but
nothing
is
to
be
done
in
the
criminal
case
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
wasn't
--
i
believe
at
11:30
in
the
morning,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
record
does
not
show
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
the
jury
had
gone
out
on
wednesday
afternoon
and
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
this
was
thursday
morning.
but
the
question
is
what
do
you
do
when
on
an
error
of
this
kind
happens,
plainly
in
our
judgment,
it
would
be
insisting
on
form
to
say
that
every
time
a
judge
makes
a
mistake
at
this
kind,
you
must
set
aside
a
criminal
conviction.
to
do
that
would
be
to
--
to
exalt
form
--
over
any
form,
over
any
substance
in
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
and
so
our
submission
is
that
if
it
appears
and
clearly
be
established
that
no
prejudice
to
the
defendant
occurred
but
then
this
is
harmless
error
or
lots
of
things
in
the
law
even
involving
constitutional
rights
that
are
harmless
error,
and
i
think
the
concept
is
application
here.
but
as
with
the
harmless
error
doctrine
generally
especially
in
a
criminal
case,
we
submit
that
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
establish
that
no
prejudice
occurred.
and
that
if
the
record
is
in
such
form
that
no
one
can
say
and
i
think
this
is
what
our
record
is
whether
the
communication
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant
prejudice
to
the
defendant
that
in
a
criminal
case
if
a
new
trial
must
be
required.
in
civil
litigation,
civil
rule
61
has
been
thought
to
be
a
--
a
great
liberal
advance
disregarding
(inaudible).
but
in
criminal
litigation,
this
court
is
always
been
true
to
another
canon
of
construction
that
we
do
not
disregard
errors
unless
we
are
sure
that
the
defendant
has
not
suffered
some
prejudice.
and
here,
i
submit,
no
one
can
possibly
be
sure
that
the
petitioner
was
not
prejudiced.
we
do
not
know
what
the
note
to
the
judge
said.
the
note
unlike
the
thousands
of
other
pages
and
paper
in
this
record,
the
note
was
not
kept.
it
was
not
made
a
matter
of
record.
it
is
readily
possible
to
conceive
of
things
that
that
note
might
have
been
said
which
would
have
been
prejudicial
to
my
client.
the
mostly
likely
possibility
is
that
the
note
indicates
the
division
of
the
jury.
i
have
no
way
and
no
one
has
any
ways
so
far
as
i
know
of
ascertaining
whether
it
did.
if
the
note
had
indicated
that
in
the
action
of
the
court
in
keeping
the
jury
locked
out
for
a
day-and-a-half,
while
they
could
not
deliberate
because
the
juror
was
ill
and
then
sending
the
jury
back
to
deliberate
with
the
juror
whose
health
was
still
not
well,
would
take
in
a
very
different
color
than
it
did.
we
do
not
know
what
the
bailiff
told
the
jury
in
response
to
the
note.
we
know
what
the
judge
told
him
to
say,
tell
him
to
keep
deliberating
but
the
tone
and
fashion
in
which
even
a
federal
judge
in
open
court
advices
jury
to
keep
deliberating
has
become
a
very
controversial
matter
in
the
courts
of
appeals
off
late
and
the
risks,
i
submit
are
very
grave
if
this
is
to
be
done
by
a
bailiff
in
the
absence
of
defendant
in
counsel
and
with
no
record
as
to
what
happened.
the
united
states,
i
suggest
with
difference
reads
shields
v.
united
states
in
a
fashion
different
than
it
appears
to
us.
they
put
the
shields
case,
a
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court
with
mr.
chief
justice
taft
to
one
side.
because
they
say
that
in
the
shields'
case
the
instruction
which
the
judge
sent
out
by
a
note,
it
was
a
matter
of
record
was
legally
erroneous.
but
that
is
a
question
which
the
united
states
is
apparently
deciding
though
this
court
expressly
refused
to
decide
it.
one
of
the
assignments
of
error
in
shields
was
that
the
note
that
the
judge
had
sent
back
was
legally
erroneous.
the
court
in
expressed
words
refuses
to
come
to
that
issue
and
instead
chooses
to
reverse
simply
because
of
the
fact
the
judge
sent
the
note
back.
i
think
the
shields
case
perhaps
maybe
read
as
going
farther
than
the
rule
which,
which
we
have
suggested
to
you,
the
rule
that
you
must
reverse
unless
there
is
a
clear
showing
if
no
prejudice
that
the
rule
that
we
put
forward
here
is
the
one
which
has
been
adopted
by
virtually
all
of
the
circuits
except
the
second
circuit
and
now
in
this
case,
the
third
circuit
ignoring
i
should
say,
several
of
its
earlier
decisions.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir,
with
the
burden
upon
the
united
states,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suppose
that
that
means
that
the
trial
court
in
the
first
instance
and
the
appellate
court
and
perhaps
this
court
are
satisfied
that
no
harm
occurred.
it
is
that
the
language
this
court
has
used
in
good
many
different
contexts,
going
all
the
way
back
to
louis
v.
united
states
in
the
united
states,
i
believe
(inaudible).
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
wouldn't
think
so,
no.
that
this
is
not
an
issue
you're
submitting
to
juries.
this
is
an
issue
that
the
courts
are
deciding
themselves.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i
think
it
would
make
sense
to
say
that
the
government
must
prove
criminal
culpability
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
that
we
may
use
a
different
standard
where
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
there's
been
any
harm
from
some
lateral
error
which
took
place
during
the
proceedings.
i
did
not
read
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
as
taking
much
issue
with
the
propositions
of
law
i
have
suggested
thus
far
on
this
point.
instead,
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
rely
almost
exclusively
on
the
absence
of
timely
objection
by
counsel
to
what
happened
and
this
also
was
the
--
a
ground
greatly
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
submission,
it
is
not
a
tenable
ground
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i
do
not
doubt
that
if
counsel
and
the
defendant
are
sitting
in
the
courtroom
and
they
see
the
judge
someone
who
jurored
over
and
talked
privately
to
the
juror,
that
is
essential
of
the
facts
of
united
states
v.
woodner,
second
circuit
decision
that
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
counsel
immediately
to
object.
they
know
what
is
going
on.
it
can
quickly
be
remedied
to
face
that
you
can't
talk
to
the
juror
without
our
being
present.
but
here,
neither
petitioner
nor
his
counsel
were
present
when
these
communications
took
place
by
the
time
they
learned
of
it.
the
united
states
attorney
called
45
minutes
later
and
advised
counsel
of
the
fact,
the
harm
was
done
if
the
judge
by
at
that
time
knew
what
the
division
of
the
jury
was,
he
knew
and
it
could
hardy
be
eradicated.
whatever
the
bailiff
said
to
the
jury
had
been
said.
and
although,
the
united
states
suggests
that
you
could
recall
the
jury
and
inquire
what
goes
on,
what
went
on,
i
think
that
the
better
perception
is
that
of
judge
friendly,
verdict
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
girsh
case
when
he
says,
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
you
should
do
is
recall
a
jury
when
it
is
in
the
process
of
its
deliberations
and
interrogate
the
jurors
on
some
collateral
point.
i
think
that
this
would
have
been
--
and
far
too
heroic
a
cure
for
what
occurred.
and
so,
in
answer
to
the
government's
argument,
that
there
is
no
objection,
i
submit,
there
is
no
rule
that
requires
objection
under
these
circumstances.
it
is
true
that
criminal
rule
51,
requires
objections
ordinarily
that
criminal
rule
51
is
very
clear
that
no
objection
is
required
if
you
had
no
opportunity
to
object
at
the
time,
the
ruling
or
action
of
the
court
took
place.
and
it
seems
--
in
my
submission,
the
government
is
now
seeking
to
affirm
a
judgment
in
which
there
was
an
error
that
i
believe
be
of
constitutional
dimension
because
of
counsel's
failure
to
that
which
no
rule
set
down
by
this
court
required
him
to
do.
in
fact,
even
if
an
objection
were
required
specifically
by
rule.
i,
i
think
that
if
the
error
is
truly
constitutional
that
such
recent
cases
as
fay
v.
noia
and
henry
v.
mississippi
would
require
a
very
searching
analysis
of
what
function
the
objection
was
thought
to
preserve
and
whether
there
had
been
a
deliberate
bypassing
on
the
part
of
petitioner
himself
rather
than
the
record
so
far
as
i
recall
does
not
show
whether
petitioner
ever
learned
of
the
telephone
call
from
the
united
states
attorney
to
counsel.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
need
get
into
that
here
because
here
in
my
submission,
trial
counsel
did
everything
that
he
was
required
to
do
by
any
rule.
and
i
think
that
the
issue
then
is,
is
properly
before
the
court
and
surely
cannot
be
disposed
off
on
the
basis,
the
third
circuit
suggested
that
since
the
evidence
of
petitioner's
guilt
was
overwhelming,
he
could
not
have
been
prejudiced
by
anything
that
happened
between
the
judge
and
the
jury.
the
jury
twice
reported
that
it
was
deadlock,
it
did
not
find
evidence
of
guilt
overwhelming
and
that
in
our
submission
is
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide
and
not
for
an
appellate
court
to
decide
for
the
reasons,
i
suggest
that
we
submit
that
the
case
should
be
reversed
with
dismissal
of
the
indictment
on
the
excise
tax
accounts
and
a
new
trial
order
on
the
wagering
tax
accounts.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
was
about
six
weeks
i
believe.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
a
long
case.
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
issues
are
presented
by
the
united
states,
grosso,
the
case
that
initially
seemed
very
unlike,
they're
related
of
course
to
marchetti,
has
now
become
virtually
the
same
case
since
the
united
states
no
longer
relies
on
the
distinction
drawn
in
kahriger
and
lewis
between
perspective
and
the
past
acts
a
distinction
that
might
have
divided
these
two
cases.
instead
as
i
understand
the
government's
position
at
the
present
time
it
puts
its
reliance
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
choice
to
gamble
and
on
the
need
for
accommodation
between
the
taxing
power,
the
privilege
arguments
that
of
course
have
felled
and
is
equally
to
the
excise
tax
of
the
occupational
tax.
the
word
accommodation
is
a
fine
word
and
the
notion
that
both
the
taxing
power
and
the
privilege
are
contained
within
the
constitution
and
each
of
these
are
of
great
importance
for
our
country
and
should
be
preserved
as
of
course
a
matter
in
which
we
make
common
cause
with
the
government.
where
we
disagree
is
how
you
do
this.
at
page
13
of
its
brief
the
government
talks
of
striking
a
balance
between
these
two
constitutional
powers.
this
is
--
many
areas
of
constitutional
law
of
course,
a
very
controversial
phrase.
but
i'd
suppose
that
at
least
with
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
its
privilege
against
self-incrimination
that
there
was
no
room
to
balance
out
the
constitutional
protection
in
order
to
serve
some
other
governmental
aim.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
one
of
power
and
one
of
privilege.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
one
of
restriction
on
the
government.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it's
a
restriction,
this
power
as
on
many
other
powers.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
quite
agree
with
you
sir.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
teaching
of
(inaudible)
is
that
you
don't
balance
the
way
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
that
no
matter
how
important
information
may
be
to
the
government.
for
example,
as
put
by
justice
harlan
for
the
court
wasn't
even
information
essential
to
national
security
cannot
be
obtained
if
there
is
a
valid
claim
of
privilege.
if
the
government
cannot
fulfill
incriminating
information
in
order
to
preserve
itself,
it's
a
little
hard
to
think
that
in
compelling
incriminating
information
in
order
to
get
comparatively
minor
amounts
of
revenue
that
we're
talking
about
here.
but
as
the
argument
has
going
this
morning,
we
have
ranged
away
from
the
wagering
taxes
to
talk
about
the
implications,
the
decision
in
these
cases
will
have
--
with
regard
to
taxes
that
are
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
exchequer
discuss
the
income
tax.
i
think
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
some
--
the
income
tax
implications.
it
is
my
understanding
that
when
i
fill
out
schedule
c,
i
was
in
my
occupation
as
lawyer.
if
i
were
not
admitted
in
the
bar,
i
think
i
would
be
entitled
to
fill
out
schedule
c
just
as
i
do
but
to
claim
my
privilege
there.
this
is
obviously
dictum
in
sullivan
but
this
apparently
is
the
position
in
which
the
internal
revenue
service
acquiesces
but
does
not
challenge
this.
and
albertson
of
course
gives
a
great
deal
of
course
to
that.
at
other
point,
some
are
returned.
one
can
list
income
but
without
specifying
the
source.
the
record
in
this
case,
unfortunately
enough,
the
portion
of
our
brief,
it
was
here,
i
believe
its
at
page
17
of
the
transcript
shows
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
paying
income
tax
every
year
and
substantial
sums
of
the
money
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
grant
that.
obviously,
if
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
not
necessarily.
i
can
distinguish
the
two
cases.
i
can
distinguish
them
on
the
ground
that
we
advanced
in
our
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
white
that
one
could
rationally
argue
that
that
gambler
is
not
required
to
fill
out
form
730
or
form
11-c
but
that
he
could
be
required
and
expose
the
source
of
his
income
on
section
1040.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
ever
been
asked
to
decide
that
question.
i
can
think
of
good
arguments
against
the
distinction
that
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
it
doesn't
control
mr.
justice
white
for
this
reason.
it
is
the
distinction
that
it
was
crucial
on
albertson
and
on
which
we
have
put
a
great
deal
of
weight
throughout
between
the
statute
singles
out
someone
in
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
activity
and
the
statute
that
is
general
in
its
application.
when
we
were
here
in
january,
i
suggested
to
the
court
that
we
cannot
build
an
entire
constitutional
doctrine
on
the
metaphor
linked
in
a
chain.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
the
incriminatory
potential
of
the
statement
depends
on
the
point
at
which
it
is
extracted
from
the
person
who
gives
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
a
particular
case,
it
maybe
damaging.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
the
difference
is
that
the
one
form
is
directed
to
this
specific
kind
of
bad
activity
and
the
other
is
not.
it
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
it
is
not
direct
--
schedule
c
is
not
directed
only
to
gamblers.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
just
so.
and
this
is
why
in
our
brief
on
reargument
after
pointing
out
two
possible
ways
in
which
shapiro
can
be
distinguished,
we
confess
that
neither
of
these
is
going
to
provide
as
much
protection
to
a
person
as
overruling
shapiro
would.
we
didn't
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
should
have
to
decide
whether
it
overruled
shapiro
and
did
not
urge
you
to
do
so.
but
we
recognize
that
a
doctrine
such
as
shapiro
is
an
inroad
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
a
doctrine
contrary
to
sullivan,
a
doctrine
that
require
your
1040
to
identify
your
source
would
be
an
inroad.
now,
the
extent
to
which
those
inroads
can
be
made
is
interesting
here
only
by
way
of
analogy,
i
don't
think
this
case
would
control
those.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
it
was
what
i
said,
then
i'm
very
sorry.
i
said
it
because
that
--
not
be
my
position.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
had
thought
that
an
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
i
was
saying
that
it
would
be
rationally
possible
to
distinguish
between
these
two
things
in
this
ground.
i
would
not
myself
make
the
argument.
i
think
you
can
distinguish
but
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
distinguish.
i
think
sullivan
was
right,
the
dictum
of
sullivan.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
this
is
similar
sir
to
the
defense
that
some
of
the
commentators
made
for
shapiro
that
to
the
average
food
dealer
keeping
records
of
the
sort,
he'd
ordinarily
and
customarily
kept
would
not
be
incriminated.
now,
with
just
bad
luck
for
shapiro
that
he
sent
him
to
jail.
i
don't
like
that.
i
don't
like
shapiro.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
take
it
on
shapiro
as
lewis
--
kahriger
and
lewis.
the
difficulty
i
have
with
the
accommodations
that
the
government
provides
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
their
first
suggestion
that
we
have
a
suitable
accommodation
in
kahriger
and
lewis
is
an
accommodation
that
leaves
the
fifth
amendment
out
entirely.
that
it
is
reading
into
the
fifth
amendment
the
exception
to
which
mr.
justice
black
worded
this
morning,
that
no
one
need
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
except
where
a
tax
is
involved.
i
can't
say
that
anything
of
substance
is
left
in
the
fifth
amendment
on
that
accommodation.
the
alternative,
the
use
restriction
is
apparently
consisted
with
the
fifth
amendment.
certainly
murphy
says
this
that
there
is
language
in
stevens
v.
marks
in
which
the
court
of
appeared
a
little
less
sure
about
it.
and
we
assume
that
use
restriction
is
a
constitutional
form
of
accommodation.
as
we've
argued
in
our
briefs
into
several
members
of
the
court
has
suggested,
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
an
accommodation
that
it
is
for
this
court
to
adopt
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
it
would
be
an
extremely
difficult
accommodation.
on
the
one
hand,
that
--
probably
would
have
the
result
of
producing
additional
revenue
for
the
federal
government.
on
the
others,
we
argue
in
our
reply
brief
and
for
reasons
that
mr.
justice
brennan
developed
it
would
significantly
limit
the
prosecution
of
gamblers.
now,
we
suggest
that
a
choice
of
this
kind
which
you're
more
interested
in,
getting
revenue
from
an
excise
tax
on
gambling
or
in
having
the
states
free
to
send
gamblers
to
jail
is
the
kind
of
a
choice
that
congress
is
better
equipped
to
make
than
is
this
court.
congress
can
determine
the
facts
that
can
count
the
costs
and
resolve
them
as
it
sees
fit.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
does
not
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
nothing
that
either
side
can
find
in
view
of
the
statute
--
the
regulations
of
prohibiting
disclosure.
the
practice
we
are
told
by
the
government
is
that
in
some
instances,
disclosure
is
made
with
regard
to
the
excise
tax
and
we
have
in
our
original
brief
cited
a
number
of
examples
in
which
the
government
had
in
fact
given
state
authorities
copies
of
the
form
730.
if
there
is
to
be
a
use
restriction
then
for
the
reasons
i
suggest,
we
think
that
is
properly
a
congressional
choice.
and
i
must
say
i'm
so
much
surprised
that
the
argument
the
government
made
is
to
why
this
is
an
appropriate
case
in
--
for
the
court
to
invent
a
use
restriction.
in
the
first
briefs,
we
said
that
if
a
use
restriction
is
something
appropriately
within
the
power
of
this
court
to
invent
on
its
own,
then
a
great
many
famous
cases
from
counselman
and
hitchcock
down
to
albertson
were
wrongly
decided
because
these
were
cases
in
which
congress
have
tried
to
provide
immunity.
it
hadn't
gone
far
enough
and
instead
of
saying,
"we'll
restrict
the
use",
the
court
has
said,
"no,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional".
at
page
22
i
believe,
his
initial
brief,
the
united
states
undertakes
to
distinguish
this
by
saying
that
in
the
counselman
or
albertson
situation,
congress
has
focused
its
attention
on
the
fifth
amendment
problems
in
a
particular
situation.
while
with
regard
to
the
wagering
tax
it
says
and
i
think
quite
rightly
that
when
the
congress
adopted
the
wagering
tax,
it
wasn't
thinking
at
all
about
fifth
amendment
problems.
those
were
the
days
when
state
incrimination
of
course
was
thought
not
to
matter.
but
this
seems
them
to
lead
to
the
paradoxical
position
that
if
congress
has
thought
about
fifth
amendment
problems
and
try
to
anticipate
them
and
to
protect
people
but
has
not
used
in
just
the
right
words
to
do
it,
then
we
strike
out
the
congressional
statutes
since
they
have
tried
again
but
if
congress
hasn't
thought
about
it
at
all,
the
tenets
for
the
court
to
think
about
it.
i
suggest
that
this
is
--
would
not
be
a
sensible
or
a
tenable
position
to
take.
we
argued
too
that
unlike
the
government
that
if
the
court
should
adopt
to
use
restriction,
the
result
in
this
case
has
to
be
reversal.
mr.
beytagh
says
that
that
character
in
lewis
were
on
the
books
and
the
defendant
should
had
noticed
of
them
and
i'm
going
to
assume
that
and
even
assume
that
for
this
purpose,
kahriger
and
lewis
would
notice
the
excise
tax
not
involved
in
any
case
in
this
court
until
grosso
was
valid.
but
if
kahriger
and
lewis
were
on
the
books
at
the
time
petitioner
failed
to
pay
his
tax
so
to
was
irvine.
and
he
would've
been
on
notice
that
if
he
paid
the
tax
that
that
evidence
could
be
use
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
now,
the
government
says
that,
if
we
are
wrong
in
our
first
view,
if
you
adopt
the
use
restriction,
then
you
recognized
that
petitioner
had
a
constitutional
privilege
not
to
pay
the
tax
but
because
now,
years
later,
a
restriction
is
put
on
the
use
of
it.
he
should
have
anticipated
that
in
the
teeth
of
irvine
and
should've
known,
"well,
if
i
pay
the
tax,
the
supreme
court
someday
will
find
the
use
restriction
and
nothing
bad
will
happen
to
me".
i
submit
that
this
is
entirely
unrealistic
and
to
uphold
a
criminal
conviction
under
a
statute
that
refers
to
a
willful
failure
in
that
kind
of
a
circumstance
would
be
pretty
noble
indeed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
are
taking
that
position,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
murphy
it
was
judicially
done.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
say
there
are
two
distinguishing
circumstances.
the
first
is
that
in
murphy,
there
was
a
legislative
judgment
by
the
new
jersey
legislature
insofar
as
it
was
within
its
power
it
--
one
of
this
information
badly
enough
that
it
was
willing
to
give
immunity.
now
here,
there
has
been
no
judgment
by
any
legislature
that
once
the
information
that
badly
and
indeed
with
regard
to
the
stamp
tax
declaration,
we
don't'
want
to
give
an
immunity,
sell
it
to
the
state
prosecutor
for
a
dollar
per
hundred
words.
the
second
distinction
is
that
murphy
involved
an
extremely
difficult
problem
in
federal
state
relations
in
which
there
was
no
ideal
solution.
i
think
that
the
court
developed
that
the
best
solution
that
it
could.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
congress
could
have
done
it.
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
their
administrative
machineries
didn't
permit
that
but
perhaps
would
not
confront
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
our
purpose
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct,
sir.
in
fact
the
government
in
its
brief
suggested
one
way
this
could
be
done.
in
our
brief,
we
indicated
that
we
thought
that
it
would
be
valid.
the
government
in
the
footnote
at
page
40
of
its
brief
suggest
the
possibility
of
having
a
more
general
excise
tax
return
form
in
which
you
would
not
be
required
to
identify
that
you're
paying
the
tax
because
it
was
on
wagers.
you
would
be
able
to
do
is
--
we
think
you're
able
to
do
now
in
the
income
tax
simply
indicate
that
you
would
incur
excise
tax
liability
in
this
amount.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
it
is
the
fact
that
you
have
to
disclose
that
you've
--
been
engaged
in
the
business
of
wagering
in
order
to
pay
the
tax.
that
isn't
enough
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
our
position,
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
is
one
other
issue
in
our
case
that's
not
marchetti
and
i
want
to
be
sure
that
it
is
not
lost
cite
of
and
make
simply
two
comments
about
it.
that
is
the
issue
of
the
private
communications
between
the
judge
and
the
jury
outside
of
the
presence
of
defendant
and
his
counsel.
the
united
states
takes
the
position
on
its
brief
that
perhaps
the
rule
that
we
proposed
that
this
is
reversible
error
unless
the
harmlessness
of
the
communication
is
made
affirmatively
to
appear
would
be
an
appropriate
enough
rule
to
adopt
in
the
proper
case
but
they
say
not
here.
they
say
defendant
did
not
object
at
the
right
time.
there
were
things
he
could've
done
when
he
learned
about
this
third
hand,
45
minutes
after
it
happened
that
might
have
had
some
curative
effect.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
with
all
the
legal
scholarship
that
has
gone
into
this
case
since
the
time
that
trial
counsel
was
in
the
heat
of
a
long
trial
and
hadn't
decided
what
to
do
or
not
to
do.
but
the
united
states
has
yet
to
produce
or
cite
any
rule
of
criminal
procedure
that
would
have
required
mr.
mclaughlin
to
have
followed
the
course
of
the
united
states
now
suggest.
it
has
not
produced
any
decision
of
this
court
that
says
that
this
is
incumbent
upon
him.
and
at
that
time,
1963,
the
law
was
clearly
established
in
the
third
circuit
in
which
he
was
practicing
by
two
cases,
a
recent
case
of
united
states
v.
neal
in
320
f.
2d
on
an
early
opinion
of
judge
maris
in
arrington
and
robinson
that
there
is
no
such
obligation
on
the
counsel.
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
hard
to
say
that
these
defendants
right
to
be
present
whenever
anything
happens
in
the
trial
against
them
was
waived
because
of
the
failure
of
his
very
competent
counsel
not
to
take
a
step
that
even
today
no
one
can
find
any
authority
for
other
than
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
when
it
finally
got
there
on
appeal.
for
these
various
reasons,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
believe
that
the
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
six
hours
of
real
argument,
nine
briefs
these
cases
have
ranged
far
and
we've
speculated
them
in
good
many
interesting
things.
there
is
i
think
one
fundamental
proposition
of
constitutional
law
that
is
central
to
the
petitioner's
case
and
that
i
think
does
help
to
resolve
some
difficulties
we've
had.
it's
a
proposition
this
court
has
stated
placed
dozen
times
in
different
ways
to
particular
formulation.
i
code
this
from
the
pry
v.
united
states
from
195
us.
the
court
there
said,
“the
taxing
power
conferred
by
the
constitution
knows
no
limits
except
those
expressly
stated
in
that
instrument.”
now
i
introduce
from
that
three
things.
first,
that
except
was
the
constitution
itself
says
xy
taxes
must
be
uniform
and
there
are
other
constitutional
limitation
of
course.
there
is
no
limit
whatever
on
the
taxing
power
of
congress.
in
response
to
the
question
from
mr.
justice
fortas
yesterday
i
said
specifically
that
i
think
congress
has
the
power
to
tax
wagering
as
such.
i
think
congress
has
the
power
to
tax
robbery,
kidnapping,
anything
that
wants
to
tax
is
valid
qualified
of
tax.
but
the
other
hand
from
great
proposition
is
that
the
taxing
power
must
acknowledge
those
limits
expressly
stated
from
the
constitution.
and
the
limit
presently
relevant
is
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
of
the
fifth
amendment.
congress
can
tax
whatever
it
wants
to
tax.
but
it
must
device
a
way
of
doing
so
that
does
not
require
persons
to
accuse
themselves
of
crime.
i
do
not
think
that
these
are
irreconcilable.
for
over
half
a
century,
the
most
important
of
our
federal
taxes,
the
income
tax
has
been
successfully
administered
even
though
it
is
not
contended
that
the
person
is
required
to
incriminate
themselves.
the
sullivan
dictum
is
respected
by
the
service.
the
taxpayer's
private
records
are
not
regarded
as
coming
with
the
shapiro
principle.
yet
we
enforced
the
tax,
if
we
have
a
reconciling
some
taxpayers
who
does
not
play
forward
his
records.
the
government
had
no
difficulty
by
netork
prosecutions
in
other
means
in
penalizing
the
violator
and
collecting
the
revenue
of
this
due
te.
i
think
that
there
are
ways
that
the
wagering
tax
could
be
collected
without
requiring
gamblers
to
come
forward
and
say,
“i
am
person
who
has
done
an
unlawful
act.”
we
suggest
that
some
of
them
are
in
brief
in
all
our
argument.
i
do
not
think
that
the
government
simply
because
it
needs
revenues
entitled
to
say
that
the
person
you
must
be
a
witness
against
yourself.
i
was
suggested
yesterday
that
perhaps
this
case
is
an
aide
for
certiorari
case
from
albertson.
i
submit
that
it
is
that
waits
so
far
as
the
government's
attempt
to
then
kahriger
and
lewis
concerned.
the
government's
other
argument,
its
attempt
to
the
use
restriction
argument
phrases
different
problems.
i
think
perhaps
the
used
restrictions
is
a
constitutional
way
that
this
tax
can
be
collected
though
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
i
have
the
gravest
doubt
as
to
propriety
of
the
use
restriction
being
imposed
by
this
court.
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
–-
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
justice
brennan,
that's
a
very
difficult
question
for
me
to
answer
for
this
reason.
i
think
from
my
client's
point
of
view,
i
want
to
say,
use
restriction.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
ought
to
argue
for
use
restriction.
i
think
i
have
a
better
chance
of
reversing
grosso's
conviction
if
i
say
to
you,
yes,
suppose
you
use
restriction
because
i
still
think
that
requires
reversal
in
my
case.
but
i
feel
that
i
have
a
duty
and
you
also
as
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
to
present
only
a
position
that
i
find
intellectually
acceptable.
and
to
me
the
notion
that
the
court
in
this
particular
statutory
context
could
say
that
despite
no
indication
from
congress
that
it
wanted
to
use
restriction,
indeed
every
indication
the
congress
wanted
this
to
be
helpful
to
prosecutors.
for
the
court
now
to
do
that,
i
think
it
would
be
for
the
court
to
be
making
a
law
that
it
is
properly
if
the
congress
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
as
i
said
mr.
justice
white
yesterday,
perhaps,
he
should
have
let
the
congress
act
there
but
i
think
that
murphy
is
distinguishable
that
the
arguments
were
referring
to
congress
they
are
less
strong
when
they
are
here.
you
did
not
have
the
murphy,
a
congressional
statute
that
didn't
so
far
as
it
could
said
to
use
this
stuff.we
do
have
that.
i'm
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
don't
have
this
clearly
in
gross
somehow
as
we
do
with
regards
to
the
occupational
tax.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
right.
but
we
do
have
the
solicitor
acknowledged
yesterday.
we
do
have
the
internal
revenue
service,
making
the
excise
tax
returns
available
to
prosecuting
authorities.
they
apparently
the
administrators
under
the
statute
think
that
they
are
carrying
out
of
congressional
purpose
when
they
disclose
this
information.
i'm
not
sure
if
the
government
is
not
enlightening
me
with
all
the
consequences
if
he
used
restriction
would
be
in
this
very
case.
eleven
form
730
weren't
produce
in
evidence
against
my
client.
form
730
is
well
by
his
and
his
brother-in-law.
i
don't
know
whether
this
would
be
permissible
under
the
united
states
view
of
use
restriction.
and
as
i
suggested
to
both
in
the
brief
from
yesterday,
i
think
there
is
a
terribly
serious
question
whether
they
used
restriction
rule
but
not
mean
an
end
to
the
prosecution
of
gamblers.
it
might
produce
more
revenue
from
the
united
states
but
i
think
it
would
make
the
prosecution
extraordinarily
difficult.
those
are
the
problems
of
showing
independent
untainted
source.
for
these
reasons
and
for
the
reason
with
regard
to
the
unauthorized
communication
and
the
absence
of
the
defendant
in
this
counsel,
the
petitioner
respectfully
request
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
of
the
issue
as
presented
by
number
181
carries
on
the
inquiry
the
court
has
been
making
yesterday
afternoon
and
today
about
wagering
taxes.
my
client
is
convicted
on
20
counts
for
involving
the
occupational
tax
and
wagers
and
16
involving
the
excise
tax
and
wagers.
he
was
sentenced
by
judge
foley
to
nine
years,
the
fine
of
$191,000
for
these
violations.
i'd
suppose
that
our
case
differed
from
marchetti
and
that
with
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
point
we
are
attacking
only
the
excise
tax
counts.
we're
not
attacking
here
the
occupational
tax
count.
and
in
our
submission,
the
excise
tax
is
invalid
whatever
maybe
the
disposition
of
kahriger
and
lewis
in
the
occupational
tax
because
of
our
reading
in
kahriger
and
lewis
is
turning
on
the
fact
that
the
occupational
tax
looks
to
future
acts
while
the
excise
tax
unequivocally
looks
to
the
past.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
my
record
i
can't.
the
record
was
not
made
in
the
trial
court
at
the
time
this
indictment
came
down
before
albertson,
before
i
believe
malloy,
there
was
no
reason
to
think
the
court
might
overrule
kahriger
and
so
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
whereas
it
--
it
had
been
raised
below.
i
assure
you
sir
that
we
would
be
attacking
it
also.
we
think
that
the
perspective
nature
of
the
occupational
tax
was
the
basis
of
kahriger
but
i
understand
mr.
beytagh
arguing
for
the
united
states
a
few
moments
ago,
to
say
that
the
united
states
does
not
rest
on
that
as
a
justification
of
kahriger-lewis
cases
and
he
puts
the
argument
now
as
--
as
an
understanding
on
the
thought
which
is
voiced
primarily
in
lewis
case
of
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
testimony
which
is
required
that
since
the
person
may
get
out
of
the
gambling
business.
he
is
under
no
compulsion
to
gamble,
therefore
under
no
compulsion
to
pay
tax
on
gambling.
now,
this
line
of
argument
of
course,
would
apply
as
much
to
the
excise
tax
as
it
does
to
the
occupational
tax
and
i've
--
we'll
get
back
and
--
and
comment
on
that
in
a
moment
but
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
question
which
the
chief
justice
put
yesterday
afternoon
to
mr.
zeldes
in
which
he
inquired
about
a
hypothetical
federal
tax
on
bucket
shops
whether
that
would
raise
the
same
problems
as
are
involved
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
chief
justice's
question
was
susceptible
of
two
readings.
if
the
tax,
the
chief
justice
had
in
mind
was
a
tax
specifically
on
the
occupation
of
running
a
bucket
shop
then
my
answer
would
be
the
same
as
mr.
zeldes
gave.
i
would
find
it
quiet
indistinguishable
from
the
taxes
we
have
here.
but
i
think
that
perhaps
what
the
chief
justice
had
in
mind
was
a
different
kind
of
tax.
a
federal
tax,
let
us
say,
when
every
person
engaged
in
the
securities
business
and
someone
so
engaged
refuses
to
pay
up
because
he
is
in
fact
running
a
bucket
shop
and
the
form
saying
that
he
is
in
the
securities
business
might
be
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
that
would
convict
him.
i
think
that
the
--
if
--
if
that
is
the
question
the
chief
justice
intended,
it
raises
extremely
important
and
interesting
problems
as
to
the
basic
theory
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
specifically,
what
kinds
of
compelled
testimony
are
incriminating.
now,
the
test
announced
by
this
court
in
the
hoffman
case
and
that
quoted
many
times
since
has
been
linked
in
a
chain.
but
i'm
perfectly
confident,
but
the
courts
never
supposed
that
an
important
and
settled
constitutional
principle
can
be
expressed
in
a
forcible
phrase.
if
one
goes
back
to
hoffman
itself,
though
the
link
in
the
chain
language
is
used.
the
court
also
speaks
of
working
to
the
implications
of
the
question,
the
setting
in
which
it
is
asked,
the
background
and
the
peculiarities
of
the
case.
i
cannot
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
extends
protection
to
any
statement
which
might
be
admissible
in
evidence
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
think
that,
if
link
in
the
chain
is
given
with
that
broad
a
reading
that
there
is
the
same
difficulty
that
professor
henry
had
observed
of
the
outcome
determined
of
test
to
guarantee
trust
that
there
is
no
logical
stopping
place.
there
is
virtually
nothing
that
a
person
could
not
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
it
is
incriminating.
i'm
personally
aware
of
the
case
in
the
utah
state
court,
some
five
years
ago
in
which
a
person
claimed
the
privilege
when
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
plaintiff
with
erwin
n.
griswold.
and
my
mind
boggles
that
the
notion
could
be
possibly
be
incriminating
to
be
acquainted
with
griswold.
and
i
think
that
here
the
key
is,
to
look
as
hoffman
says
and
i
think
albertson
now
develops
the
theory
further
to
look
at
the
point
at
which
the
inquiry
is
made,
the
circumstances
in
which
it
is
made.
i
think
that
this
is
the
reason
why
the
government
concedes
that
the
sullivan
case
does
not
control
here.
it
is
true
that
one
reporting
income
tax
conceivably
could
report
something
which
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
in
a
later
case.
income
tax
returns
have
come
in
and
in
some
kinds
of
litigation.
but
as
we
said
in
--
in
albertson,
the
questions
are
neutral
in
there
face
and
they're
directed
to
the
public
at
large.
the
risk
of
incrimination
is
here
a
minimal
risk.
we
go
to
the
other
extreme,
you
have
a
person
who
has
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
some
investigative
body
and
here
a
question
which
addressed
to
the
world
generally
might
be
neutral
and
non-incriminating
because
of
the
setting
takes
on
a
much
more
sinister
cast.
and
in
my
submission,
what
the
fifth
amendment
really
protects
is
against
a
person
being
compelled
to
give
any
testimony
which
will
have
a
substantial
effect
of
accusing
himself
of
the
crime.
now
on
that
analysis,
i
return
to
the
bucket
shop
case
which
provoked
it.
if
the
federal
tax
in
question
whereas
i
understood
the
chief
justice
to
suggest
a
general
tax
then
i
would
say
that
there
would
not
be
a
constitutional
privilege.
that
the
likelihood
of
incrimination
and
asking
people
to
say
that
i
am
engaged
in
the
securities
business
is
very
small
and
that
even
for
the
bucket
shop
operator,
this
would
be
such
a
very
small
part
of
the
case
against
him.
the
government's
case
would
require
much
more
than
that
and
this
i
think
would
really
be
insignificant.
i
deal
in
the
same
way
with
the
example
that
the
united
states
puts
in
its
brief,
can
a
person
refuse
to
pay
real
estate
taxes
because
of
the
property
which
he
owns
is
being
used
for
purposes
of
prostitution.
and
as
the
government
points
out,
if
you
have
a
person
who
is
himself
being
charged
with
prostitution
and
he's
asked,
“do
you
own
this
property?”
then
you
have
i
think
a
very
substantial
link
in
the
chain.
but
if
you
simply
ask
the
whole
world
to
come
forward
and
pay
real
estate
taxes
on
the
property
they
own,
i
think
that
you
come
again
on
the
language
of
albertson,
the
requirement
is
neutral
on
its
face
and
directed
at
the
public
at
large.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
submission,
the
gambling
business
is
much
more
like
the
business
of
receiving
stolen
property
than
it
is
like
the
securities
business.
i
recognized
of
course,
the
point
that
you
make
with
here
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
find
it
inconceivable
than
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
any
state
would.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
to
me
with
respect
sir,
it
does
not.
i've
done
--
so
far
as
the
power
of
congress
to
tax
is
concerned,
we
think
the
congress
has
the
power
to
lay
an
excise
tax
in
any
business
whatever
even
if
it
is
as
receiving
stolen
goods
illegal
in
every
state.
in
the
enforcement
of
such
a
tax,
i
think
that
the
congress
is
constitutionally
required
to
observe
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
though,
it
may
have
other
techniques
available
for
enforcement,
it
cannot
ask
the
law
breaker
himself
to
come
forward
and
confess
his
sins.
on
the
point
of
voluntariness
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
i
think
so
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
there
are
several
ways
that
you
could
enforce
payment
of
the
tax
without
requiring
but
mr.
justice
black,
years
ago
called
“the
squeezing
device”.
one
would
be
to
--
for
the
congress
to
enact
a
genuinely
workable
immunity
provision.
the
congress
in
many
other
instances
where
it
is
wanted
information
has
provided
for
immunity,
it
could
do
so
here.
what
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
would
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don't
think
the
criminal
sanction
for
nonpayment
of
the
tax
is
improper.
provided
that
there
is
some
way
that
it
can
be
paid
without
the
taxpayer
incriminating
himself.
the
government
has
assumes
arguendo
in
its
brief
what
we
have
argued
specifically
with
regard
to
these
gambling
taxes
that
it
is
not
possible
to
pay
the
tax
without
identifying
yourself
as
having
received
wagers
in
the
preceding
month.
but
i
--
i
think
that
there
--
the
immunity
statute
i
proposed
is
not
the
only
way
congress
can
enforce
such
a
tax.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
no,
i
--
i
do
not
think
i'm
saying
that
at
all.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
suggesting
sir,
that
if
the
congress
gives
immunity
and
provides
that
the
fact
of
payment
may
not
be
used
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
pardon?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
immunity
either
from
use
as
evidence
or
from
use
as
an
investigatory
relief,
if
in
other
words,
it
creates
an
immunity
broad
enough
to
meet
the
test
of
counselman
v.
hitchcock
and
all
the
wager
cases,
then
i
think
the
person
who
does
not
pay
maybe
prosecuted
for
nonpayment.
the
problem
here
is
that
you
cannot
pay
without
self-accusation.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest
that
you
would
do
very
much
what
the
government
has
proposed
and
what
this
court
did
essentially
in
murphy,
it
would
put
the
burden
on
the
prosecution
to
establish
that
they
had
obtained
all
their
evidence
free
from
anything.
now,
i
personally
believe
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
should
think
that
you
would
have
to
so
hold
if
you
were
to
invent
such
an
immunity
in
order
for
it,
to
survive
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
thought
so.
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
that
comes
up
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
albertson
itself,
the
court
describes
the
evidence
or
investigatory
lead
as
the
measure
of
what
must
be
done
if
immunity
is
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
i'm
suggesting
one.
i
of
course,
do
not
think
it
all
but
it
would
be
right
for
this
court
as
the
government
suggests
to
invent
such
a
rule.
i
think
this
would
raise
the
very
gravest
questions
of
separations
of
powers
and
if
this
is
particularly
the
kind
of
question
which
the
congress
is
much
better
equipped
to
decide
than
is
this
court.
the
congress
can
find
out
the
facts
as
to
whether
the
tax
can
ever
be
enforceable,
whether
the
revenues
will
produce
or
worth
it
and
i
would
think
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that's
a
very
different
case
because
there
at
the
state,
those
legislative
branch
had
undertaken
to
provide
immunity
and
the
question
was
how
this
could
be
made
effective
in
our
dual
federalism
system.
and
i
--
i
think
the
court
really
had
very
little
recourse
there
except
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
it
was
an
alternative
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
agree.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
excuse
me.
i
agree
mr.
justice
white.
the
court
could
have
waited
but
it
seems
to
me
a
much
less
step
if
the
court
took
there
where
at
least
the
state
of
new
jersey
had
undertaken
so
far
as
it
could
to
give
immunity.
then
it
would
be
here
where
there
is
no
indication
whatever
that
congress
wanted
to
provide
in
the
immunity.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
arises
in
my
submission
because
it
is
more
properly
to
the
branch
of
the
government
that
makes
laws
to
decide
whether
it
wants
to
obtain
testimony
at
the
price
of
making
various
evidence
unavailable
to
federal
and
state
authorities.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
there
you
at
least
had
a
legislative
branch
that
had
said
we
want
this
enough,if
we're
going
to
give
as
much
immunity
as
we
can
in
order
to
get
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
that
is
right.
and
this
court
said,
we'll
cooperate
with
the
state
and
keep
the
evidence
out
for
the
federal
purposes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
difference
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
is
that
in
the
(inaudible)
fashion,
the
fruit
of
poison
tree,
search
and
seizure,
this
is
the
only
remedy
that
can
be
provided.
the
violation
has
already
taken
place
and
this
court
has
fashioned,
what
is
now
a
constitutional
rule
of
exclusion.
but
here
we
are
back
a
step
earlier
in
the
process.
here
the
man
has
not
yet
been
compelled
to
say
anything
and
the
question
is,
should
he
be
compelled
to
speak
out?
and
then
later
we'll
provide
some
remedy
for
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
find
it
very
different.
in
the
cases
that
you
speak
of
sir,
these
are
--
the
problem
is
how
you
administer
justice
in
the
federal
courts
or
as
--
as
you
have
now
expand
to
it
and
the
courts
throughout
the
united
states
generally.
what
the
government
is
suggesting
here
however,
on
the
assumption
which
they
make
in
there
alternative
argument
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
here
applicable.
they
are
saying
that
you
should
bail
out
the
congress
that
the
--
you
should
make
the
statute
enforceable
so
that
the
congress
can
get
a
hundred
million
dollars
in
15
years.
even
though
the
congress
didn't
do
this
itself
insofar
as
the
congress
showed
an
intent,
the
congress
said
“we
don't
want
this
kept
secret.
we
want
the
occupational
tax
list
to
be
public.
we
don't
want
any
immunity
all
to
be
granted.”
my
time
is
very
short
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
second
issue,
the
case
involves.
but
i'm
fearful
that
if
i
do
not
get
to
it,
it
would
seem
to
suggest
that
we
agree
with
the
unimportance
the
united
states
attaches
to
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
it,
it
is
not.
but
as
the
united
states
is
conceded
in
its
brief,
they
are
made
available
to
state
prosecuting
authorities
and
people
have
been
convicted
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
this
i,
i
know
but
the
united
states
says
in
its
brief
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there's
no
secrecy
provision
on
the
statute
to
the
regulations
with
regard
to
them.
there's
no
provision
expressly
requiring
the
disclosure
as
there
is
with
the
occupational
tax.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
remain
persuaded
mr.
justice
black
that
these
questions
of
secrecy
or
disclosure
are
congressional
questions
and
not
judicial
questions,
i
don't
regard
that
issue
as
essential
to
my
case
because
it
seems
to
me
even
if
the
court
were
to
do
what
united
states
suggests
that
it
would
be
unthinkable
that
this
conviction
could
be
affirmed
that
this
taxpayer
could
be
expected
to
have
anticipated
in
1961
to
the
1967,
the
court
will
provide
some
form
of
protection
so
that
what
he
said
would
not
incriminate.
and
so
i
would
think
the
reversal
on
this
case
would
be
required
in
any
event
and
that
is
of
course
all
that
i
entitled
to
argue
for
here.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
a
bit
of
extra
time
then
before
i
turn
to
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
let
me
say
a
word
of
voluntariness
since
the
government
has
argued
that
with
such
vigor,
i
would
have
thought
that
albertson
was
enough
as
a
matter
of
precedent
to
refute
the
voluntariness
argument
because
albertson
was
under
no
more
compulsion
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
when
my
client
is
to
be
a
gambler.
he
had
a
free
choice.
nevertheless,
the
court
said
that
the
registration
provision
would
violate
the
privileges
against
him.
and
if
the
argument
be
put
not
on
precedent
but
on
principle,
the
government's
argument,
i
submit
would
be
destructive
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it
is
hard
to
think
of
any
incriminating
testimony
about
which
it
could
not
be
said
well,
if
you
didn't
have
to
commit
that
crime.
you
voluntarily
chose
to
violate
the
man
act
to
commit
a
burglary
or
whatever
it
is
you
did.
therefore
since
you
did
it
voluntarily
we're
not
compelling
you
now
to
be
a
witness
against
yourself,
your
own
acts
what's
got
you
into
it.
i
think
that
the
voluntariness
concept
would
truly
put
a
man
to
the
fifth
amendment
as
we've
known
it
throughout
our
history.
on
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
the
facts
very
briefly
that
while
the
jury
was
out
deliberating,
it
send
a
note
to
the
judge
in
the
absence
of
petitioner
and
his
counsel.
the
judge
then
sent
an
oral
instruction
through
the
bailiff
in
the
absence
of
petitioner
and
his
counsel
to
the
jury.
this
was
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
obvious
error.
an
obvious
error
it
is
under
the
line
of
decisions
here
which
go
back
to
1894
but
nothing
is
to
be
done
in
the
criminal
case
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
wasn't
--
i
believe
at
11:30
in
the
morning,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
record
does
not
show
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
the
jury
had
gone
out
on
wednesday
afternoon
and
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
this
was
thursday
morning.
but
the
question
is
what
do
you
do
when
on
an
error
of
this
kind
happens,
plainly
in
our
judgment,
it
would
be
insisting
on
form
to
say
that
every
time
a
judge
makes
a
mistake
at
this
kind,
you
must
set
aside
a
criminal
conviction.
to
do
that
would
be
to
--
to
exalt
form
--
over
any
form,
over
any
substance
in
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
and
so
our
submission
is
that
if
it
appears
and
clearly
be
established
that
no
prejudice
to
the
defendant
occurred
but
then
this
is
harmless
error
or
lots
of
things
in
the
law
even
involving
constitutional
rights
that
are
harmless
error,
and
i
think
the
concept
is
application
here.
but
as
with
the
harmless
error
doctrine
generally
especially
in
a
criminal
case,
we
submit
that
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
establish
that
no
prejudice
occurred.
and
that
if
the
record
is
in
such
form
that
no
one
can
say
and
i
think
this
is
what
our
record
is
whether
the
communication
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant
prejudice
to
the
defendant
that
in
a
criminal
case
if
a
new
trial
must
be
required.
in
civil
litigation,
civil
rule
61
has
been
thought
to
be
a
--
a
great
liberal
advance
disregarding
(inaudible).
but
in
criminal
litigation,
this
court
is
always
been
true
to
another
canon
of
construction
that
we
do
not
disregard
errors
unless
we
are
sure
that
the
defendant
has
not
suffered
some
prejudice.
and
here,
i
submit,
no
one
can
possibly
be
sure
that
the
petitioner
was
not
prejudiced.
we
do
not
know
what
the
note
to
the
judge
said.
the
note
unlike
the
thousands
of
other
pages
and
paper
in
this
record,
the
note
was
not
kept.
it
was
not
made
a
matter
of
record.
it
is
readily
possible
to
conceive
of
things
that
that
note
might
have
been
said
which
would
have
been
prejudicial
to
my
client.
the
mostly
likely
possibility
is
that
the
note
indicates
the
division
of
the
jury.
i
have
no
way
and
no
one
has
any
ways
so
far
as
i
know
of
ascertaining
whether
it
did.
if
the
note
had
indicated
that
in
the
action
of
the
court
in
keeping
the
jury
locked
out
for
a
day-and-a-half,
while
they
could
not
deliberate
because
the
juror
was
ill
and
then
sending
the
jury
back
to
deliberate
with
the
juror
whose
health
was
still
not
well,
would
take
in
a
very
different
color
than
it
did.
we
do
not
know
what
the
bailiff
told
the
jury
in
response
to
the
note.
we
know
what
the
judge
told
him
to
say,
tell
him
to
keep
deliberating
but
the
tone
and
fashion
in
which
even
a
federal
judge
in
open
court
advices
jury
to
keep
deliberating
has
become
a
very
controversial
matter
in
the
courts
of
appeals
off
late
and
the
risks,
i
submit
are
very
grave
if
this
is
to
be
done
by
a
bailiff
in
the
absence
of
defendant
in
counsel
and
with
no
record
as
to
what
happened.
the
united
states,
i
suggest
with
difference
reads
shields
v.
united
states
in
a
fashion
different
than
it
appears
to
us.
they
put
the
shields
case,
a
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court
with
mr.
chief
justice
taft
to
one
side.
because
they
say
that
in
the
shields'
case
the
instruction
which
the
judge
sent
out
by
a
note,
it
was
a
matter
of
record
was
legally
erroneous.
but
that
is
a
question
which
the
united
states
is
apparently
deciding
though
this
court
expressly
refused
to
decide
it.
one
of
the
assignments
of
error
in
shields
was
that
the
note
that
the
judge
had
sent
back
was
legally
erroneous.
the
court
in
expressed
words
refuses
to
come
to
that
issue
and
instead
chooses
to
reverse
simply
because
of
the
fact
the
judge
sent
the
note
back.
i
think
the
shields
case
perhaps
maybe
read
as
going
farther
than
the
rule
which,
which
we
have
suggested
to
you,
the
rule
that
you
must
reverse
unless
there
is
a
clear
showing
if
no
prejudice
that
the
rule
that
we
put
forward
here
is
the
one
which
has
been
adopted
by
virtually
all
of
the
circuits
except
the
second
circuit
and
now
in
this
case,
the
third
circuit
ignoring
i
should
say,
several
of
its
earlier
decisions.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir,
with
the
burden
upon
the
united
states,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suppose
that
that
means
that
the
trial
court
in
the
first
instance
and
the
appellate
court
and
perhaps
this
court
are
satisfied
that
no
harm
occurred.
it
is
that
the
language
this
court
has
used
in
good
many
different
contexts,
going
all
the
way
back
to
louis
v.
united
states
in
the
united
states,
i
believe
(inaudible).
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
wouldn't
think
so,
no.
that
this
is
not
an
issue
you're
submitting
to
juries.
this
is
an
issue
that
the
courts
are
deciding
themselves.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i
think
it
would
make
sense
to
say
that
the
government
must
prove
criminal
culpability
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
that
we
may
use
a
different
standard
where
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
there's
been
any
harm
from
some
lateral
error
which
took
place
during
the
proceedings.
i
did
not
read
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
as
taking
much
issue
with
the
propositions
of
law
i
have
suggested
thus
far
on
this
point.
instead,
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
rely
almost
exclusively
on
the
absence
of
timely
objection
by
counsel
to
what
happened
and
this
also
was
the
--
a
ground
greatly
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
submission,
it
is
not
a
tenable
ground
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i
do
not
doubt
that
if
counsel
and
the
defendant
are
sitting
in
the
courtroom
and
they
see
the
judge
someone
who
jurored
over
and
talked
privately
to
the
juror,
that
is
essential
of
the
facts
of
united
states
v.
woodner,
second
circuit
decision
that
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
counsel
immediately
to
object.
they
know
what
is
going
on.
it
can
quickly
be
remedied
to
face
that
you
can't
talk
to
the
juror
without
our
being
present.
but
here,
neither
petitioner
nor
his
counsel
were
present
when
these
communications
took
place
by
the
time
they
learned
of
it.
the
united
states
attorney
called
45
minutes
later
and
advised
counsel
of
the
fact,
the
harm
was
done
if
the
judge
by
at
that
time
knew
what
the
division
of
the
jury
was,
he
knew
and
it
could
hardy
be
eradicated.
whatever
the
bailiff
said
to
the
jury
had
been
said.
and
although,
the
united
states
suggests
that
you
could
recall
the
jury
and
inquire
what
goes
on,
what
went
on,
i
think
that
the
better
perception
is
that
of
judge
friendly,
verdict
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
girsh
case
when
he
says,
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
you
should
do
is
recall
a
jury
when
it
is
in
the
process
of
its
deliberations
and
interrogate
the
jurors
on
some
collateral
point.
i
think
that
this
would
have
been
--
and
far
too
heroic
a
cure
for
what
occurred.
and
so,
in
answer
to
the
government's
argument,
that
there
is
no
objection,
i
submit,
there
is
no
rule
that
requires
objection
under
these
circumstances.
it
is
true
that
criminal
rule
51,
requires
objections
ordinarily
that
criminal
rule
51
is
very
clear
that
no
objection
is
required
if
you
had
no
opportunity
to
object
at
the
time,
the
ruling
or
action
of
the
court
took
place.
and
it
seems
--
in
my
submission,
the
government
is
now
seeking
to
affirm
a
judgment
in
which
there
was
an
error
that
i
believe
be
of
constitutional
dimension
because
of
counsel's
failure
to
that
which
no
rule
set
down
by
this
court
required
him
to
do.
in
fact,
even
if
an
objection
were
required
specifically
by
rule.
i,
i
think
that
if
the
error
is
truly
constitutional
that
such
recent
cases
as
fay
v.
noia
and
henry
v.
mississippi
would
require
a
very
searching
analysis
of
what
function
the
objection
was
thought
to
preserve
and
whether
there
had
been
a
deliberate
bypassing
on
the
part
of
petitioner
himself
rather
than
the
record
so
far
as
i
recall
does
not
show
whether
petitioner
ever
learned
of
the
telephone
call
from
the
united
states
attorney
to
counsel.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
need
get
into
that
here
because
here
in
my
submission,
trial
counsel
did
everything
that
he
was
required
to
do
by
any
rule.
and
i
think
that
the
issue
then
is,
is
properly
before
the
court
and
surely
cannot
be
disposed
off
on
the
basis,
the
third
circuit
suggested
that
since
the
evidence
of
petitioner's
guilt
was
overwhelming,
he
could
not
have
been
prejudiced
by
anything
that
happened
between
the
judge
and
the
jury.
the
jury
twice
reported
that
it
was
deadlock,
it
did
not
find
evidence
of
guilt
overwhelming
and
that
in
our
submission
is
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide
and
not
for
an
appellate
court
to
decide
for
the
reasons,
i
suggest
that
we
submit
that
the
case
should
be
reversed
with
dismissal
of
the
indictment
on
the
excise
tax
accounts
and
a
new
trial
order
on
the
wagering
tax
accounts.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
was
about
six
weeks
i
believe.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
a
long
case.
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
issues
are
presented
by
the
united
states,
grosso,
the
case
that
initially
seemed
very
unlike,
they're
related
of
course
to
marchetti,
has
now
become
virtually
the
same
case
since
the
united
states
no
longer
relies
on
the
distinction
drawn
in
kahriger
and
lewis
between
perspective
and
the
past
acts
a
distinction
that
might
have
divided
these
two
cases.
instead
as
i
understand
the
government's
position
at
the
present
time
it
puts
its
reliance
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
choice
to
gamble
and
on
the
need
for
accommodation
between
the
taxing
power,
the
privilege
arguments
that
of
course
have
felled
and
is
equally
to
the
excise
tax
of
the
occupational
tax.
the
word
accommodation
is
a
fine
word
and
the
notion
that
both
the
taxing
power
and
the
privilege
are
contained
within
the
constitution
and
each
of
these
are
of
great
importance
for
our
country
and
should
be
preserved
as
of
course
a
matter
in
which
we
make
common
cause
with
the
government.
where
we
disagree
is
how
you
do
this.
at
page
13
of
its
brief
the
government
talks
of
striking
a
balance
between
these
two
constitutional
powers.
this
is
--
many
areas
of
constitutional
law
of
course,
a
very
controversial
phrase.
but
i'd
suppose
that
at
least
with
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
its
privilege
against
self-incrimination
that
there
was
no
room
to
balance
out
the
constitutional
protection
in
order
to
serve
some
other
governmental
aim.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
one
of
power
and
one
of
privilege.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
one
of
restriction
on
the
government.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it's
a
restriction,
this
power
as
on
many
other
powers.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
quite
agree
with
you
sir.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
teaching
of
(inaudible)
is
that
you
don't
balance
the
way
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
that
no
matter
how
important
information
may
be
to
the
government.
for
example,
as
put
by
justice
harlan
for
the
court
wasn't
even
information
essential
to
national
security
cannot
be
obtained
if
there
is
a
valid
claim
of
privilege.
if
the
government
cannot
fulfill
incriminating
information
in
order
to
preserve
itself,
it's
a
little
hard
to
think
that
in
compelling
incriminating
information
in
order
to
get
comparatively
minor
amounts
of
revenue
that
we're
talking
about
here.
but
as
the
argument
has
going
this
morning,
we
have
ranged
away
from
the
wagering
taxes
to
talk
about
the
implications,
the
decision
in
these
cases
will
have
--
with
regard
to
taxes
that
are
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
exchequer
discuss
the
income
tax.
i
think
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
some
--
the
income
tax
implications.
it
is
my
understanding
that
when
i
fill
out
schedule
c,
i
was
in
my
occupation
as
lawyer.
if
i
were
not
admitted
in
the
bar,
i
think
i
would
be
entitled
to
fill
out
schedule
c
just
as
i
do
but
to
claim
my
privilege
there.
this
is
obviously
dictum
in
sullivan
but
this
apparently
is
the
position
in
which
the
internal
revenue
service
acquiesces
but
does
not
challenge
this.
and
albertson
of
course
gives
a
great
deal
of
course
to
that.
at
other
point,
some
are
returned.
one
can
list
income
but
without
specifying
the
source.
the
record
in
this
case,
unfortunately
enough,
the
portion
of
our
brief,
it
was
here,
i
believe
its
at
page
17
of
the
transcript
shows
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
paying
income
tax
every
year
and
substantial
sums
of
the
money
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
grant
that.
obviously,
if
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
not
necessarily.
i
can
distinguish
the
two
cases.
i
can
distinguish
them
on
the
ground
that
we
advanced
in
our
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
white
that
one
could
rationally
argue
that
that
gambler
is
not
required
to
fill
out
form
730
or
form
11-c
but
that
he
could
be
required
and
expose
the
source
of
his
income
on
section
1040.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
ever
been
asked
to
decide
that
question.
i
can
think
of
good
arguments
against
the
distinction
that
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
it
doesn't
control
mr.
justice
white
for
this
reason.
it
is
the
distinction
that
it
was
crucial
on
albertson
and
on
which
we
have
put
a
great
deal
of
weight
throughout
between
the
statute
singles
out
someone
in
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
activity
and
the
statute
that
is
general
in
its
application.
when
we
were
here
in
january,
i
suggested
to
the
court
that
we
cannot
build
an
entire
constitutional
doctrine
on
the
metaphor
linked
in
a
chain.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
the
incriminatory
potential
of
the
statement
depends
on
the
point
at
which
it
is
extracted
from
the
person
who
gives
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
a
particular
case,
it
maybe
damaging.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
the
difference
is
that
the
one
form
is
directed
to
this
specific
kind
of
bad
activity
and
the
other
is
not.
it
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
it
is
not
direct
--
schedule
c
is
not
directed
only
to
gamblers.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
just
so.
and
this
is
why
in
our
brief
on
reargument
after
pointing
out
two
possible
ways
in
which
shapiro
can
be
distinguished,
we
confess
that
neither
of
these
is
going
to
provide
as
much
protection
to
a
person
as
overruling
shapiro
would.
we
didn't
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
should
have
to
decide
whether
it
overruled
shapiro
and
did
not
urge
you
to
do
so.
but
we
recognize
that
a
doctrine
such
as
shapiro
is
an
inroad
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
a
doctrine
contrary
to
sullivan,
a
doctrine
that
require
your
1040
to
identify
your
source
would
be
an
inroad.
now,
the
extent
to
which
those
inroads
can
be
made
is
interesting
here
only
by
way
of
analogy,
i
don't
think
this
case
would
control
those.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
it
was
what
i
said,
then
i'm
very
sorry.
i
said
it
because
that
--
not
be
my
position.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
had
thought
that
an
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
i
was
saying
that
it
would
be
rationally
possible
to
distinguish
between
these
two
things
in
this
ground.
i
would
not
myself
make
the
argument.
i
think
you
can
distinguish
but
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
distinguish.
i
think
sullivan
was
right,
the
dictum
of
sullivan.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
this
is
similar
sir
to
the
defense
that
some
of
the
commentators
made
for
shapiro
that
to
the
average
food
dealer
keeping
records
of
the
sort,
he'd
ordinarily
and
customarily
kept
would
not
be
incriminated.
now,
with
just
bad
luck
for
shapiro
that
he
sent
him
to
jail.
i
don't
like
that.
i
don't
like
shapiro.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
take
it
on
shapiro
as
lewis
--
kahriger
and
lewis.
the
difficulty
i
have
with
the
accommodations
that
the
government
provides
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
their
first
suggestion
that
we
have
a
suitable
accommodation
in
kahriger
and
lewis
is
an
accommodation
that
leaves
the
fifth
amendment
out
entirely.
that
it
is
reading
into
the
fifth
amendment
the
exception
to
which
mr.
justice
black
worded
this
morning,
that
no
one
need
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
except
where
a
tax
is
involved.
i
can't
say
that
anything
of
substance
is
left
in
the
fifth
amendment
on
that
accommodation.
the
alternative,
the
use
restriction
is
apparently
consisted
with
the
fifth
amendment.
certainly
murphy
says
this
that
there
is
language
in
stevens
v.
marks
in
which
the
court
of
appeared
a
little
less
sure
about
it.
and
we
assume
that
use
restriction
is
a
constitutional
form
of
accommodation.
as
we've
argued
in
our
briefs
into
several
members
of
the
court
has
suggested,
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
an
accommodation
that
it
is
for
this
court
to
adopt
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
it
would
be
an
extremely
difficult
accommodation.
on
the
one
hand,
that
--
probably
would
have
the
result
of
producing
additional
revenue
for
the
federal
government.
on
the
others,
we
argue
in
our
reply
brief
and
for
reasons
that
mr.
justice
brennan
developed
it
would
significantly
limit
the
prosecution
of
gamblers.
now,
we
suggest
that
a
choice
of
this
kind
which
you're
more
interested
in,
getting
revenue
from
an
excise
tax
on
gambling
or
in
having
the
states
free
to
send
gamblers
to
jail
is
the
kind
of
a
choice
that
congress
is
better
equipped
to
make
than
is
this
court.
congress
can
determine
the
facts
that
can
count
the
costs
and
resolve
them
as
it
sees
fit.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
does
not
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
nothing
that
either
side
can
find
in
view
of
the
statute
--
the
regulations
of
prohibiting
disclosure.
the
practice
we
are
told
by
the
government
is
that
in
some
instances,
disclosure
is
made
with
regard
to
the
excise
tax
and
we
have
in
our
original
brief
cited
a
number
of
examples
in
which
the
government
had
in
fact
given
state
authorities
copies
of
the
form
730.
if
there
is
to
be
a
use
restriction
then
for
the
reasons
i
suggest,
we
think
that
is
properly
a
congressional
choice.
and
i
must
say
i'm
so
much
surprised
that
the
argument
the
government
made
is
to
why
this
is
an
appropriate
case
in
--
for
the
court
to
invent
a
use
restriction.
in
the
first
briefs,
we
said
that
if
a
use
restriction
is
something
appropriately
within
the
power
of
this
court
to
invent
on
its
own,
then
a
great
many
famous
cases
from
counselman
and
hitchcock
down
to
albertson
were
wrongly
decided
because
these
were
cases
in
which
congress
have
tried
to
provide
immunity.
it
hadn't
gone
far
enough
and
instead
of
saying,
"we'll
restrict
the
use",
the
court
has
said,
"no,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional".
at
page
22
i
believe,
his
initial
brief,
the
united
states
undertakes
to
distinguish
this
by
saying
that
in
the
counselman
or
albertson
situation,
congress
has
focused
its
attention
on
the
fifth
amendment
problems
in
a
particular
situation.
while
with
regard
to
the
wagering
tax
it
says
and
i
think
quite
rightly
that
when
the
congress
adopted
the
wagering
tax,
it
wasn't
thinking
at
all
about
fifth
amendment
problems.
those
were
the
days
when
state
incrimination
of
course
was
thought
not
to
matter.
but
this
seems
them
to
lead
to
the
paradoxical
position
that
if
congress
has
thought
about
fifth
amendment
problems
and
try
to
anticipate
them
and
to
protect
people
but
has
not
used
in
just
the
right
words
to
do
it,
then
we
strike
out
the
congressional
statutes
since
they
have
tried
again
but
if
congress
hasn't
thought
about
it
at
all,
the
tenets
for
the
court
to
think
about
it.
i
suggest
that
this
is
--
would
not
be
a
sensible
or
a
tenable
position
to
take.
we
argued
too
that
unlike
the
government
that
if
the
court
should
adopt
to
use
restriction,
the
result
in
this
case
has
to
be
reversal.
mr.
beytagh
says
that
that
character
in
lewis
were
on
the
books
and
the
defendant
should
had
noticed
of
them
and
i'm
going
to
assume
that
and
even
assume
that
for
this
purpose,
kahriger
and
lewis
would
notice
the
excise
tax
not
involved
in
any
case
in
this
court
until
grosso
was
valid.
but
if
kahriger
and
lewis
were
on
the
books
at
the
time
petitioner
failed
to
pay
his
tax
so
to
was
irvine.
and
he
would've
been
on
notice
that
if
he
paid
the
tax
that
that
evidence
could
be
use
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
now,
the
government
says
that,
if
we
are
wrong
in
our
first
view,
if
you
adopt
the
use
restriction,
then
you
recognized
that
petitioner
had
a
constitutional
privilege
not
to
pay
the
tax
but
because
now,
years
later,
a
restriction
is
put
on
the
use
of
it.
he
should
have
anticipated
that
in
the
teeth
of
irvine
and
should've
known,
"well,
if
i
pay
the
tax,
the
supreme
court
someday
will
find
the
use
restriction
and
nothing
bad
will
happen
to
me".
i
submit
that
this
is
entirely
unrealistic
and
to
uphold
a
criminal
conviction
under
a
statute
that
refers
to
a
willful
failure
in
that
kind
of
a
circumstance
would
be
pretty
noble
indeed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
are
taking
that
position,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
murphy
it
was
judicially
done.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
i
say
there
are
two
distinguishing
circumstances.
the
first
is
that
in
murphy,
there
was
a
legislative
judgment
by
the
new
jersey
legislature
insofar
as
it
was
within
its
power
it
--
one
of
this
information
badly
enough
that
it
was
willing
to
give
immunity.
now
here,
there
has
been
no
judgment
by
any
legislature
that
once
the
information
that
badly
and
indeed
with
regard
to
the
stamp
tax
declaration,
we
don't'
want
to
give
an
immunity,
sell
it
to
the
state
prosecutor
for
a
dollar
per
hundred
words.
the
second
distinction
is
that
murphy
involved
an
extremely
difficult
problem
in
federal
state
relations
in
which
there
was
no
ideal
solution.
i
think
that
the
court
developed
that
the
best
solution
that
it
could.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
congress
could
have
done
it.
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
their
administrative
machineries
didn't
permit
that
but
perhaps
would
not
confront
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
our
purpose
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct,
sir.
in
fact
the
government
in
its
brief
suggested
one
way
this
could
be
done.
in
our
brief,
we
indicated
that
we
thought
that
it
would
be
valid.
the
government
in
the
footnote
at
page
40
of
its
brief
suggest
the
possibility
of
having
a
more
general
excise
tax
return
form
in
which
you
would
not
be
required
to
identify
that
you're
paying
the
tax
because
it
was
on
wagers.
you
would
be
able
to
do
is
--
we
think
you're
able
to
do
now
in
the
income
tax
simply
indicate
that
you
would
incur
excise
tax
liability
in
this
amount.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
it
is
the
fact
that
you
have
to
disclose
that
you've
--
been
engaged
in
the
business
of
wagering
in
order
to
pay
the
tax.
that
isn't
enough
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
our
position,
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
is
one
other
issue
in
our
case
that's
not
marchetti
and
i
want
to
be
sure
that
it
is
not
lost
cite
of
and
make
simply
two
comments
about
it.
that
is
the
issue
of
the
private
communications
between
the
judge
and
the
jury
outside
of
the
presence
of
defendant
and
his
counsel.
the
united
states
takes
the
position
on
its
brief
that
perhaps
the
rule
that
we
proposed
that
this
is
reversible
error
unless
the
harmlessness
of
the
communication
is
made
affirmatively
to
appear
would
be
an
appropriate
enough
rule
to
adopt
in
the
proper
case
but
they
say
not
here.
they
say
defendant
did
not
object
at
the
right
time.
there
were
things
he
could've
done
when
he
learned
about
this
third
hand,
45
minutes
after
it
happened
that
might
have
had
some
curative
effect.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
with
all
the
legal
scholarship
that
has
gone
into
this
case
since
the
time
that
trial
counsel
was
in
the
heat
of
a
long
trial
and
hadn't
decided
what
to
do
or
not
to
do.
but
the
united
states
has
yet
to
produce
or
cite
any
rule
of
criminal
procedure
that
would
have
required
mr.
mclaughlin
to
have
followed
the
course
of
the
united
states
now
suggest.
it
has
not
produced
any
decision
of
this
court
that
says
that
this
is
incumbent
upon
him.
and
at
that
time,
1963,
the
law
was
clearly
established
in
the
third
circuit
in
which
he
was
practicing
by
two
cases,
a
recent
case
of
united
states
v.
neal
in
320
f.
2d
on
an
early
opinion
of
judge
maris
in
arrington
and
robinson
that
there
is
no
such
obligation
on
the
counsel.
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
hard
to
say
that
these
defendants
right
to
be
present
whenever
anything
happens
in
the
trial
against
them
was
waived
because
of
the
failure
of
his
very
competent
counsel
not
to
take
a
step
that
even
today
no
one
can
find
any
authority
for
other
than
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
when
it
finally
got
there
on
appeal.
for
these
various
reasons,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
believe
that
the
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
six
hours
of
real
argument,
nine
briefs
these
cases
have
ranged
far
and
we've
speculated
them
in
good
many
interesting
things.
there
is
i
think
one
fundamental
proposition
of
constitutional
law
that
is
central
to
the
petitioner's
case
and
that
i
think
does
help
to
resolve
some
difficulties
we've
had.
it's
a
proposition
this
court
has
stated
placed
dozen
times
in
different
ways
to
particular
formulation.
i
code
this
from
the
pry
v.
united
states
from
195
us.
the
court
there
said,
“the
taxing
power
conferred
by
the
constitution
knows
no
limits
except
those
expressly
stated
in
that
instrument.”
now
i
introduce
from
that
three
things.
first,
that
except
was
the
constitution
itself
says
xy
taxes
must
be
uniform
and
there
are
other
constitutional
limitation
of
course.
there
is
no
limit
whatever
on
the
taxing
power
of
congress.
in
response
to
the
question
from
mr.
justice
fortas
yesterday
i
said
specifically
that
i
think
congress
has
the
power
to
tax
wagering
as
such.
i
think
congress
has
the
power
to
tax
robbery,
kidnapping,
anything
that
wants
to
tax
is
valid
qualified
of
tax.
but
the
other
hand
from
great
proposition
is
that
the
taxing
power
must
acknowledge
those
limits
expressly
stated
from
the
constitution.
and
the
limit
presently
relevant
is
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
of
the
fifth
amendment.
congress
can
tax
whatever
it
wants
to
tax.
but
it
must
device
a
way
of
doing
so
that
does
not
require
persons
to
accuse
themselves
of
crime.
i
do
not
think
that
these
are
irreconcilable.
for
over
half
a
century,
the
most
important
of
our
federal
taxes,
the
income
tax
has
been
successfully
administered
even
though
it
is
not
contended
that
the
person
is
required
to
incriminate
themselves.
the
sullivan
dictum
is
respected
by
the
service.
the
taxpayer's
private
records
are
not
regarded
as
coming
with
the
shapiro
principle.
yet
we
enforced
the
tax,
if
we
have
a
reconciling
some
taxpayers
who
does
not
play
forward
his
records.
the
government
had
no
difficulty
by
netork
prosecutions
in
other
means
in
penalizing
the
violator
and
collecting
the
revenue
of
this
due
te.
i
think
that
there
are
ways
that
the
wagering
tax
could
be
collected
without
requiring
gamblers
to
come
forward
and
say,
“i
am
person
who
has
done
an
unlawful
act.”
we
suggest
that
some
of
them
are
in
brief
in
all
our
argument.
i
do
not
think
that
the
government
simply
because
it
needs
revenues
entitled
to
say
that
the
person
you
must
be
a
witness
against
yourself.
i
was
suggested
yesterday
that
perhaps
this
case
is
an
aide
for
certiorari
case
from
albertson.
i
submit
that
it
is
that
waits
so
far
as
the
government's
attempt
to
then
kahriger
and
lewis
concerned.
the
government's
other
argument,
its
attempt
to
the
use
restriction
argument
phrases
different
problems.
i
think
perhaps
the
used
restrictions
is
a
constitutional
way
that
this
tax
can
be
collected
though
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
i
have
the
gravest
doubt
as
to
propriety
of
the
use
restriction
being
imposed
by
this
court.
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
–-
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
justice
brennan,
that's
a
very
difficult
question
for
me
to
answer
for
this
reason.
i
think
from
my
client's
point
of
view,
i
want
to
say,
use
restriction.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
ought
to
argue
for
use
restriction.
i
think
i
have
a
better
chance
of
reversing
grosso's
conviction
if
i
say
to
you,
yes,
suppose
you
use
restriction
because
i
still
think
that
requires
reversal
in
my
case.
but
i
feel
that
i
have
a
duty
and
you
also
as
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
to
present
only
a
position
that
i
find
intellectually
acceptable.
and
to
me
the
notion
that
the
court
in
this
particular
statutory
context
could
say
that
despite
no
indication
from
congress
that
it
wanted
to
use
restriction,
indeed
every
indication
the
congress
wanted
this
to
be
helpful
to
prosecutors.
for
the
court
now
to
do
that,
i
think
it
would
be
for
the
court
to
be
making
a
law
that
it
is
properly
if
the
congress
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
as
i
said
mr.
justice
white
yesterday,
perhaps,
he
should
have
let
the
congress
act
there
but
i
think
that
murphy
is
distinguishable
that
the
arguments
were
referring
to
congress
they
are
less
strong
when
they
are
here.
you
did
not
have
the
murphy,
a
congressional
statute
that
didn't
so
far
as
it
could
said
to
use
this
stuff.we
do
have
that.
i'm
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
don't
have
this
clearly
in
gross
somehow
as
we
do
with
regards
to
the
occupational
tax.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
right.
but
we
do
have
the
solicitor
acknowledged
yesterday.
we
do
have
the
internal
revenue
service,
making
the
excise
tax
returns
available
to
prosecuting
authorities.
they
apparently
the
administrators
under
the
statute
think
that
they
are
carrying
out
of
congressional
purpose
when
they
disclose
this
information.
i'm
not
sure
if
the
government
is
not
enlightening
me
with
all
the
consequences
if
he
used
restriction
would
be
in
this
very
case.
eleven
form
730
weren't
produce
in
evidence
against
my
client.
form
730
is
well
by
his
and
his
brother-in-law.
i
don't
know
whether
this
would
be
permissible
under
the
united
states
view
of
use
restriction.
and
as
i
suggested
to
both
in
the
brief
from
yesterday,
i
think
there
is
a
terribly
serious
question
whether
they
used
restriction
rule
but
not
mean
an
end
to
the
prosecution
of
gamblers.
it
might
produce
more
revenue
from
the
united
states
but
i
think
it
would
make
the
prosecution
extraordinarily
difficult.
those
are
the
problems
of
showing
independent
untainted
source.
for
these
reasons
and
for
the
reason
with
regard
to
the
unauthorized
communication
and
the
absence
of
the
defendant
in
this
counsel,
the
petitioner
respectfully
request
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
