justice
byron
r.
white
both
can
make
a
payment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
a
federal
statute
that
says
that,
there
is
a
tax
on
burglary,
there
is
a
tax
on,
on
receiving
stolen
property,
and
if
you
don't
pay
it
--
if
you
don't
pay
it,
you
can
be
put
in
jail?
that's
all
--
the
only
provision
there
is?
and
the
only
requirement
is
to
pay
the
tax.
if
you
don't
pay
it,
it's
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
--
did
do
you
say
that
the
criminal
sanction
is
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
immunity
statute
would
--
would
there
be?
you're
just
saying
that,
no,
the
–
you
have
to
have
immunity
statute,
the
criminal
sanction
for
not
paying
is
unenforceable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
certainly?
justice
byron
r.
white
immunities
from
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
immunity
from
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
they
could
have
waited
perfectly
if
that
was
one
of
the
alternatives
to
wait
for
congress
to
do
something
about
it.
you
just
simply
ban
the
compelled
testimony
until
congress
decides
whether
or
not
it
will
grant
an
immunity
in
those
situations.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
didn't
wait.
the
court
said
that
for
federal
purposes
the
information
can't
be
used
on
the
leads
--
and
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
when
there
is
a
question
made
that
their
prosecution
did
not
arise
out
of
these
disclosures?
or
that
in
the
evidence
they
use
in
the
prosecution
did
not
arise
other
than
disclosures?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
pardon
me.
pardon
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
read
wholly
aside
from
this
separation
authority,
what
do
you
think
in
--
in
murphy
against
waterfront,
as
i
read
that
case
the
court
said
that
--
said
that
protection
that
was
supporting
there
was
--
it
was
--
it
was
what
counselman
against
hitchcock
required
(inaudible),
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
court
decides
that
the
third
issue
to
get
through
and
it
would
also
be
willful
failure
to
pay
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
when
there's
a
failure
to
supply
and
then
it
will
be
a
willful
of
failure
to
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
take
the
gambler
now,
is
it
saying
the
gambler
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
who's
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
(inaudible)
doesn't
require
the
privilege
(inaudible)
that
despite
of
sullivan
and
in
spite
of
the
internal
revenue
service
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
you'd
say
that
--
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
this
state
--
schedule
c
when
he
files
his
income
tax
return
and
if
this
--
what's
the
nature
of
your
business,
what's
the
address,
so
on
and
so
forth.
now,
i
don't
know
why
that's
any
less
damaging
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
same
here
with
the
same
fellow,
at
the
same
time,
he's
got
to
file
(inaudible),
one
730,
one
1040.
he
gets
the
--
both
forms
that
require
about
the
same
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
schedule
c
is
--
1040
is
directed
specifically
at
this
individual
proprietorship
and
wants
to
know
precisely
what
business
he's
in
and
he
may
have
no
other
income
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
agree
with
that
but
as
far
as
he's
concerned,
he
could
care
less.
it
applies
to
other
people,
does
it
apply
to
him,
even
his
gambling
business
incriminates
him
just
as
much
in
form
730
though
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that's
what
you
said
a
while
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
schedule
c
is
going
to
be
applied
to
the
gambler
applies
in
an
area
then
that
--
as
you,
permeated
with
illegality
in
albertson
said.
and
schedule
c
in
that
respect
is
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
we
didn't
--
in
murphy
that
wasn't
what
happened
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
you
to
suggest
that
if
congress
impose
--
that
if
the
statute
now
provided
for
a
use
restriction
such
of
the
scope
and
the
type
that
the
government
suggest
that
this
could
satisfy
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
wouldn't
say
if
there's
--
and
there's
immunity
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
congress
could
have
done
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
beytagh,
how
would
you
mechanically
handle
this
in
the
tax
situation
in
that?
would
you
just
say
that
a
fellow
just
goes
ahead
and
files
whatever
forms
the
government
requires
and
then
if
the
government
prosecutes
sometime
later,
if
the
defendant
claims,
does
the
defendant
have
to
claim
that
they're
using
some
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
the
government
has
to
claim
that
they
haven't
used
any
of
the
information
on
the
return
whether
incriminatory
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
in
propounding
this
rule
or
just
use
restriction?
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
defendant
--
that
the
fellow
who
wants
to
file
should
it
--
that
kind
not
to
make
any
claim
of
immunity
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
when
you
claim
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
shouldn't
have
to
say
at
the
outset
that
there
are
some
of
these
questions
that
i
don't
want
to
answer.
they're
just
automatically
--
they
just
--
that
information
just
--
right
across
the
board
wouldn't
be
utilized
to
go
into
criminal
prosecution?
the
government
had
its
choice
in
between
--
and
of
course
this
wouldn't
take
the
choice
away
from
congress
that
this
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
didn't
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
can
make
a
payment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
a
federal
statute
that
says
that,
there
is
a
tax
on
burglary,
there
is
a
tax
on,
on

and
if
you
don't
pay
it

if
you
don't

you
can
be
put
in
jail?
that's
all
--
the
only
provision
there
is?
and
the
only
requirement
is
to
pay
the
tax.
if
you
don't
pay
it,
it's
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
--
did
do
you
say
that
the
criminal
sanction
is
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
immunity
statute
would
--
would
there
be?
you're
just
saying
that,
no,
the
–
you
have
to
have
immunity
statute,
the
criminal
sanction
for
not
paying
is
unenforceable?
justice

you
are
