justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
said,
there
the
word
furnished
that
would
be
prima
facie
evidence
so
to
speak.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
were
to
say
that
there
were
furnished
then
if
the
state
requires
to
them
the
burden
of
proof
as
the
connotation
and
if
it
construed
to
you
and
the
evidence
will
probably
make
it
speaking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
clear
showing
of
no
prejudice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
–
what's
a
clear
showing
mean?
what
that's
going
to
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
be
beyond
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
wanted
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
time
was
it?
when
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1951.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
other
of
those
taxes
that
you
refer
had
to
pass
to
the
knowledge
that
was
considerable
doubt
if
--
it
is
whether
they
see
them
leave?.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
asking
if
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
doubt
about
how
they
will
be
paid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not,
it's
in
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
one,
that
they've
done
it
on
this
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
does
it
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
haven't
supplied
an
adequate
staff,
how
much
--
how
did
they
supplied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
way
to
get
those
cost
without
too
much
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
two
men
--
two
offenders
test,
i
didn't
want
to
suggest
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
an
idea
that
you'd
look
it
up,
you'd
find
that
there
were
a
great
many
rules
all
over
the
nation,
had
a
federal
license.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that
hit
in
alabama.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
one
of
those
things
just
stuck
up
at
your
place
of
business
to
show
that
you
at
least
–
if
not
licensed,
running
against
the
law
for
them
to
sell
whisky.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
gave
them
the
right
to
justify
the
federal
government
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
state
which
outlaw's
cabaret?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
is
that
what
you
were
talking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
gets
down
does
it
not
to
the
question
of
whether,
or
wants
to
get
rid
of
tax
or
for
some
other
reason,
the
thing
that
they
can
find
the
answer
is
are
you
guilty
of
violating
the
gambling
or
is
your
failure,
that's
what
it
gets
to
in
the
final
analysis,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it
gets
this
far?
that's
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i,
i
say
you
--
had
you
were
talking
then
about
the
others
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
it
finally
gets
down.
the
issue
is
for
us
to
return
rather
an
order
to
collect
any
kind
of
tax.
the
government
has
power
to
make
a
man
confess
to
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
not
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
is
that
--
that
the
final
question
involved
with
reference
to
the
inquiry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
aren't
they
interested
in
making
him
confess
whether
he
is
engaged
in
as
a
gambler.
isn't
that
the
issue
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
which
it
depends?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
that
the
reason.
what
is
the
issue
of
fact
between
the
government
and
one
that
wants
to
pay
taxes
for
gambling
when
it
wants
to
ask,
where
did
you
get
your
money?
what
is
the
issue
if
not
that
this
was
gambling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
then
you're
saying
--
then
you're
saying,
if
there
is
a
difference
in
the
kind
of
information
they
asked
a
man
to
give.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
if
they
can
--
the
man
that
he
pays
his
tax
that
they
must
stop
the
time
when
they
seek
to
make
him
incriminate
himself,
are
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
saying.
but
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
you're
saying
that's
not
the
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
do
i.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
–
it's
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
whether
a
man
shall
be
compelled
to
admit
that
he
has
committed
a
crime
in
order
to
pay
his
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
basically,
that's
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
the
government
tried
and
it
can
make
him
violate
because
of
the
fifth
amendment.
but
that's
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
belief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
belief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
just
started
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
substantial
reason
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
want
to
ask
you
this
question
about
the
six
weeks,
how
did
it
happen
to
take
six
weeks
to
--
if
you
tell
me
just
lay
it
briefly.
why
did
it
take
six
weeks
to
try
this
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
amount
of
testimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
testimony
did
the
government
offer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
it
that
been
true,
i
don't
see,
how
could
it
take
them
six
weeks?
did
they
summon
all
the
people
are
supposed
to
be
gambling
there
and
people
who
had
been
gambling
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
try
out
his
guilt
of
being
a
gambler?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
he
testify,
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
know
--
you
just
don't
know
enough
to
give
me
the
real
facts
about
that
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
--
i
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it's
not
relevant
but
i
--
i'm
just
curious
to
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
defendants
--
how
many
co-indictees
were
there—
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it
be
an
appropriate
exercise
in
the
taxing
power,
if
the
government
wants
to
tax
burglary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
provision
of
the
constitution
that
address
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it
found
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
about
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
taxing
does
implicate
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
couldn't
you
tax
with
embezzlement?
why
couldn't
you
tax
burglary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
you
make
this
an
income
tax?
the
burglar
gets
income
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
couldn't
tax
a
burglar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
can
enact
it,
why
couldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
government
can
tax
criminal
in
congress,
could
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you'd
--
you
admit
it
from
tax
burglary,
the
burglar
has
to
pay
tax
on
his
income,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
he
be
compelled
to
admit
burglary,
insist
of
doing
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
burglary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
its
--
it
wouldn't
be
as
curious
plan,
is
it?
the
government
was
barred
from
turning
those
--
the
bills
of
rights
says,
don't
judge
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
answer
is
that
its
taxable,
isn't
it
as
income
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
income
from
burglars?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
talking
about
a
different
named
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
exactly
what
they're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understood
it,
it
was
not
the
business
they
engage
in
is
unlawful.
but
if
the
government
is
forbidden
by
the
fifth
amendment
to
compel
him
to
admit
that
guilt
to
the
crime,
it's
a
quite
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
the
affair
would
not
ask
you
to
confess
a
crime.
they
couldn't
pay
with
the
death
sentence
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
they
are.
and
that's
quite
different
to
say
that
you
can't
tax
them
because
their
business
is
unlawful
to
entirely
oppose
to
one
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
if
your
view
that
when
a
man
speaks
the
fifth
amendment
which
is
specific,
directly
aim
statement
that
the
government
if
the
government
will
not
decide
that
make
him
confess
to
a
crime.
you
say
that
he's
saying
that
he
can't
be
attack
because
his
business
is
unlawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly
because
they
wouldn't
be
ask
to
confess
to
his
crime.
that's
all
but
the
two
are
different.
and
you're
trying
to
equalize
the
claim
that
you
can't
give
them
help,
admit
you
are
guilt
to
the
crime
to
acclaim
that
you
can't
beat
with
the
crime
that
they
have
tax
on
an
unlawful
business.
and
how
could
no
suggests
of
that
kind
from
anyone
of
the
defendants.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
raise
--
that
raise
all
is
not
their
claim.
that's
not
their
claims?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
like
accommodation
that
the
fifth
amendment
which
was
written
with
the
purpose
being
to
make
sure
that
they
could
not
go
too
far
on
the
necessary
in
proper
turnover
to
imply
things
about
the
defendant.
and
when
they
did
that,
did
it
with
a
purpose
that
matters
had
been
said,
of
forbidding
something
that
entitles
and
forbidding
the
manner
in
which
something
else
should
be
done.
what
they
did
was
to
leave
that
open
to
the
courts
to
construe
the
amendment,
so
that
the
man
could
be
made
to
confess
with
his
crime,
if
you
will
use
the
word
accommodation.
that's
your
argument
of
that
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
accommodation.
what
do
you
mean
by
accommodation?you
mean
knocking
it
out
in
that
field,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you've
used
in
this
connection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
a
case
involving
state
compact,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
state
agreement
to
waterfront.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
right
here,
why
can't
you
use
the
same
accommodation
for
the
reference
to
the
first
amendment
or
the
reference
to
freedom
of
religion,
freedom
of
press,
and
freedom
of
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
suggesting
that
an
amendment
passed
after
the
constitutional
with
the
doctrine
for
the
express
republished
of
forbidding
the
government
to
do
certain
thing.
can
be
taken
out
from
the
protection
of
the
person
by
use
of
the
word
“accommodation”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
finally
get
back
to
this
fact
that
you
make
this
fifth
amendment
mean
less,
do
you
not?
and
it
says
to
the
effect,
“that
no
person
should
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
you
are
--
you
do
know
that
and
you
would
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
fifth
amendment
means
and
that
provision
over
the
court
and
your
argument
about
accommodation?
what
protection
does
it
give
that
the
congress
cannot
take
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
protection
if
the
court
cannot
take
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court's
judges
then
it's
the
same
as
all
the
amendment
have
been
written,
that
there's
no
person
would
be
compelled
to
be
witness
against
himself
unless
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
holds
innocent
--
in
its
judgment.
you
should
accommodate
that
so
as
to
make
him
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
certain
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
--
did
you
think
one
of
its
functions
is
to
take
away
rights
that
have
been
granted
for
the
bill
of
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does,
doesn't
he?
you
argued
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
forget
the
president.
what
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
does
go
beyond
it
unless
you
accept
the
broad
and
elastic
concept
of
due
process
which
has
been
suggested.
namely,
that
it's
a
balancing
of
the
rights
of
the
bill
of
rights
against
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
written
before
it
was
written.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
shouldn't
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
shouldn't
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
depends
on
what
kind
of
privilege
it
is,
doesn't
it?
whether
it's
granted
in
terms
that
cannot
be
changed
by
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can't
believe
the
language
and
tell
what
it
means,
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
and
i
think
justice
black
that
he
has
pointed
out
yesterday.
when
you
step
back
and
look
at
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
country
today.
a
large
country
that's
got
a
large
government
and
a
lot
of
programs
in
which
self
reporting
and
some
disclosure
is
just
essential
to
the
operation
of
that.
if
we
read
the
fifth
amendment,
as
is
sanctioning
a
complete
and
total
right
to
remain
silent
in
any
circumstances.
if
some
individual
feels
that
he
has
that
right,
then
i
think
we're
in
trouble.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
majority
of
this
court
is
going
along
as
lines.
and
we
submit
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
desirable
thing
to
do
that.
in
the
schmerber
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
privilege
doesn't
protect
the
whole
complex,
the
values
that
it
relates
to.
and
that's
--
that's
all
that
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
there's
any
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
this
court
cannot
accommodate
of
ballots
out
of
the
suggested
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
if
it
says
you
shall
not
do
anything.
the
court
got
to
accommodate
that
the
other
provision
of
the
constitution
say
it's
tender?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
can,
if
the
court
has
the
power
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
not
asking
what
court
has
done.
is
it
--
if
it
shows
position
and
if
the
consent
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
anyone
part
of
it,
the
government
shall
not
do
this
that
this
court
has
the
right
to
accommodate
that
out
of
existence
and
say
it
can
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
you
knew
from
your
attack
you're
making
now
against
the
field.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
would
you
accommodate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
because
it
says
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
what's
your
crucial
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
here?
would
you
repeat
it
or
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
read
or
repeat
here
sir.
what
does
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
compel
justice
hugo
l.
black
compulsory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
does
this
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
your
law
do?
does
it
compel
him
to
be
a
witness
to
testify
that
he's
not
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
returning
to
the
murphy
rational.
now,
i
wonder
if
that
turns
to
the
constitution.
i
want
you
to
explain
how
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
how
the
language
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you
just
quote
it,
lend
itself
to
have
in
this
court
say,
that
you
can
compel
him
to
do
it.
although
the
constitution
says,
you
cannot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
say,
you're
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
information?
that
define
the
information
which
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
answer
the
question
about
what?
whether
he's
been
guilty
of
violating
the
law?
isn't
that
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
the
question
that's
asking
the
report?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
does
that
violate
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
makes
him
as
criminal
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
makes
him
a
criminal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
said,
there
the
word
furnished
that
would
be
prima
facie
evidence
so
to
speak.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
were
to
say
that
there
were
furnished
then
if
the
state
requires
to
them
the
burden
of
proof
as
the
connotation
and
if
it
construed
to
you
and
the
evidence
will
probably
make
it
speaking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
clear
showing
of
no
prejudice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
–
what's
a
clear
showing
mean?
what
that's
going
to
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
be
beyond
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
wanted
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
time
was
it?
when
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1951.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
other
of
those
taxes
that
you
refer
had
to
pass
to
the
knowledge
that
was
considerable
doubt
if
--
it
is
whether
they
see
them
leave?.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
asking
if
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
doubt
about
how
they
will
be
paid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not,
it's
in
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
one,
that
they've
done
it
on
this
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
does
it
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
haven't
supplied
an
adequate
staff,
how
much
--
how
did
they
supplied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
way
to
get
those
cost
without
too
much
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
two
men
--
two
offenders
test,
i
didn't
want
to
suggest
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
an
idea
that
you'd
look
it
up,
you'd
find
that
there
were
a
great
many
rules
all
over
the
nation,
had
a
federal
license.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that
hit
in
alabama.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
one
of
those
things
just
stuck
up
at
your
place
of
business
to
show
that
you
at
least
–
if
not
licensed,
running
against
the
law
for
them
to
sell
whisky.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
gave
them
the
right
to
justify
the
federal
government
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
state
which
outlaw's
cabaret?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
is
that
what
you
were
talking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
gets
down
does
it
not
to
the
question
of
whether,
or
wants
to
get
rid
of
tax
or
for
some
other
reason,
the
thing
that
they
can
find
the
answer
is
are
you
guilty
of
violating
the
gambling
or
is
your
failure,
that's
what
it
gets
to
in
the
final
analysis,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it
gets
this
far?
that's
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i,
i
say
you
--
had
you
were
talking
then
about
the
others
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
it
finally
gets
down.
the
issue
is
for
us
to
return
rather
an
order
to
collect
any
kind
of
tax.
the
government
has
power
to
make
a
man
confess
to
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
not
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
is
that
--
that
the
final
question
involved
with
reference
to
the
inquiry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
aren't
they
interested
in
making
him
confess
whether
he
is
engaged
in
as
a
gambler.
isn't
that
the
issue
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
which
it
depends?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
that
the
reason.
what
is
the
issue
of
fact
between
the
government
and
one
that
wants
to
pay
taxes
for
gambling
when
it
wants
to
ask,
where
did
you
get
your
money?
what
is
the
issue
if
not
that
this
was
gambling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
then
you're
saying
--
then
you're
saying,
if
there
is
a
difference
in
the
kind
of
information
they
asked
a
man
to
give.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
if
they
can
--
the
man
that
he
pays
his
tax
that
they
must
stop
the
time
when
they
seek
to
make
him
incriminate
himself,
are
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
saying.
but
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
you're
saying
that's
not
the
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
do
i.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
–
it's
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
whether
a
man
shall
be
compelled
to
admit
that
he
has
committed
a
crime
in
order
to
pay
his
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
basically,
that's
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
the
government
tried
and
it
can
make
him
violate
because
of
the
fifth
amendment.
but
that's
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
belief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
belief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
just
started
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
substantial
reason
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
want
to
ask
you
this
question
about
the
six
weeks,
how
did
it
happen
to
take
six
weeks
to
--
if
you
tell
me
just
lay
it
briefly.
why
did
it
take
six
weeks
to
try
this
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
amount
of
testimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
testimony
did
the
government
offer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
it
that
been
true,
i
don't
see,
how
could
it
take
them
six
weeks?
did
they
summon
all
the
people
are
supposed
to
be
gambling
there
and
people
who
had
been
gambling
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
try
out
his
guilt
of
being
a
gambler?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
he
testify,
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
know
--
you
just
don't
know
enough
to
give
me
the
real
facts
about
that
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
--
i
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it's
not
relevant
but
i
--
i'm
just
curious
to
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
defendants
--
how
many
co-indictees
were
there—
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it
be
an
appropriate
exercise
in
the
taxing
power,
if
the
government
wants
to
tax
burglary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
provision
of
the
constitution
that
address
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it
found
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
about
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
taxing
does
implicate
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
couldn't
you
tax
with
embezzlement?
why
couldn't
you
tax
burglary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
you
make
this
an
income
tax?
the
burglar
gets
income
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
couldn't
tax
a
burglar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
can
enact
it,
why
couldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
government
can
tax
criminal
in
congress,
could
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you'd
--
you
admit
it
from
tax
burglary,
the
burglar
has
to
pay
tax
on
his
income,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
he
be
compelled
to
admit
burglary,
insist
of
doing
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
burglary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
its
--
it
wouldn't
be
as
curious
plan,
is
it?
the
government
was
barred
from
turning
those
--
the
bills
of
rights
says,
don't
judge
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
answer
is
that
its
taxable,
isn't
it
as
income
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
income
from
burglars?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
talking
about
a
different
named
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
exactly
what
they're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understood
it,
it
was
not
the
business
they
engage
in
is
unlawful.
but
if
the
government
is
forbidden
by
the
fifth
amendment
to
compel
him
to
admit
that
guilt
to
the
crime,
it's
a
quite
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
the
affair
would
not
ask
you
to
confess
a
crime.
they
couldn't
pay
with
the
death
sentence
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
they
are.
and
that's
quite
different
to
say
that
you
can't
tax
them
because
their
business
is
unlawful
to
entirely
oppose
to
one
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
if
your
view
that
when
a
man
speaks
the
fifth
amendment
which
is
specific,
directly
aim
statement
that
the
government
if
the
government
will
not
decide
that
make
him
confess
to
a
crime.
you
say
that
he's
saying
that
he
can't
be
attack
because
his
business
is
unlawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly
because
they
wouldn't
be
ask
to
confess
to
his
crime.
that's
all
but
the
two
are
different.
and
you're
trying
to
equalize
the
claim
that
you
can't
give
them
help,
admit
you
are
guilt
to
the
crime
to
acclaim
that
you
can't
beat
with
the
crime
that
they
have
tax
on
an
unlawful
business.
and
how
could
no
suggests
of
that
kind
from
anyone
of
the
defendants.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
raise
--
that
raise
all
is
not
their
claim.
that's
not
their
claims?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
like
accommodation
that
the
fifth
amendment
which
was
written
with
the
purpose
being
to
make
sure
that
they
could
not
go
too
far
on
the
necessary
in
proper
turnover
to
imply
things
about
the
defendant.
and
when
they
did
that,
did
it
with
a
purpose
that
matters
had
been
said,
of
forbidding
something
that
entitles
and
forbidding
the
manner
in
which
something
else
should
be
done.
what
they
did
was
to
leave
that
open
to
the
courts
to
construe
the
amendment,
so
that
the
man
could
be
made
to
confess
with
his
crime,
if
you
will
use
the
word
accommodation.
that's
your
argument
of
that
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
accommodation.
what
do
you
mean
by
accommodation?you
mean
knocking
it
out
in
that
field,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you've
used
in
this
connection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
a
case
involving
state
compact,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
state
agreement
to
waterfront.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
right
here,
why
can't
you
use
the
same
accommodation
for
the
reference
to
the
first
amendment
or
the
reference
to
freedom
of
religion,
freedom
of
press,
and
freedom
of
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
suggesting
that
an
amendment
passed
after
the
constitutional
with
the
doctrine
for
the
express
republished
of
forbidding
the
government
to
do
certain
thing.
can
be
taken
out
from
the
protection
of
the
person
by
use
of
the
word
“accommodation”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
finally
get
back
to
this
fact
that
you
make
this
fifth
amendment
mean
less,
do
you
not?
and
it
says
to
the
effect,
“that
no
person
should
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
you
are
--
you
do
know
that
and
you
would
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
fifth
amendment
means
and
that
provision
over
the
court
and
your
argument
about
accommodation?
what
protection
does
it
give
that
the
congress
cannot
take
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
protection
if
the
court
cannot
take
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court's
judges
then
it's
the
same
as
all
the
amendment
have
been
written,
that
there's
no
person
would
be
compelled
to
be
witness
against
himself
unless
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
holds
innocent
--
in
its
judgment.
you
should
accommodate
that
so
as
to
make
him
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
certain
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
--
did
you
think
one
of
its
functions
is
to
take
away
rights
that
have
been
granted
for
the
bill
of
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does,
doesn't
he?
you
argued
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
forget
the
president.
what
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
does
go
beyond
it
unless
you
accept
the
broad
and
elastic
concept
of
due
process
which
has
been
suggested.
namely,
that
it's
a
balancing
of
the
rights
of
the
bill
of
rights
against
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
written
before
it
was
written.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
shouldn't
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
shouldn't
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
depends
on
what
kind
of
privilege
it
is,
doesn't
it?
whether
it's
granted
in
terms
that
cannot
be
changed
by
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can't
believe
the
language
and
tell
what
it
means,
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
and
i
think
justice
black
that
he
has
pointed
out
yesterday.
when
you
step
back
and
look
at
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
country
today.
a
large
country
that's
got
a
large
government
and
a
lot
of
programs
in
which
self
reporting
and
some
disclosure
is
just
essential
to
the
operation
of
that.
if
we
read
the
fifth
amendment,
as
is
sanctioning
a
complete
and
total
right
to
remain
silent
in
any
circumstances.
if
some
individual
feels
that
he
has
that
right,
then
i
think
we're
in
trouble.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
majority
of
this
court
is
going
along
as
lines.
and
we
submit
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
desirable
thing
to
do
that.
in
the
schmerber
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
privilege
doesn't
protect
the
whole
complex,
the
values
that
it
relates
to.
and
that's
--
that's
all
that
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
there's
any
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
this
court
cannot
accommodate
of
ballots
out
of
the
suggested
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
if
it
says
you
shall
not
do
anything.
the
court
got
to
accommodate
that
the
other
provision
of
the
constitution
say
it's
tender?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
can,
if
the
court
has
the
power
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
not
asking
what
court
has
done.
is
it
--
if
it
shows
position
and
if
the
consent
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
anyone
part
of
it,
the
government
shall
not
do
this
that
this
court
has
the
right
to
accommodate
that
out
of
existence
and
say
it
can
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
you
knew
from
your
attack
you're
making
now
against
the
field.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
would
you
accommodate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
because
it
says
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
what's
your
crucial
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
here?
would
you
repeat
it
or
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
read
or
repeat
here
sir.
what
does
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
compel
justice
hugo
l.
black
compulsory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
does
this
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
your
law
do?
does
it
compel
him
to
be
a
witness
to
testify
that
he's
not
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
returning
to
the
murphy
rational.
now,
i
wonder
if
that
turns
to
the
constitution.
i
want
you
to
explain
how
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
how
the
language
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you
just
quote
it,
lend
itself
to
have
in
this
court
say,
that
you
can
compel
him
to
do
it.
although
the
constitution
says,
you
cannot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
say,
you're
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
information?
that
define
the
information
which
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
answer
the
question
about
what?
whether
he's
been
guilty
of
violating
the
law?
isn't
that
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
the
question
that's
asking
the
report?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
does
that
violate
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
makes
him
as
criminal
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
makes
him
a
criminal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all.
