mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
professor
wright
has
pointed
out
this
case
involves
as
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
claim
is
concerned,
failure
to
pay
the
10%
excise
tax
on
wagers
as
distinguished
from
the
$50
special
occupational
tax
that
--
and
the
registration
requirement
that
we're
involved
in
marchetti,
the
prior
case.
in
the
main
as
professor
wright
points
out,
the
position
that
the
government
takes
in
the
two
cases
is
substantially
the
same.
i
would
like
to
discuss
first,
this
other
issue
that
professor
wright
refers
to
in
passing
and
then
come
back
to
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
as
we
understand
it,
petitioner's
contention
is
that
here
the
trial
judge's
treatment
of
a
note
which
he
received
from
the
jury
was
such
that
it
required
reversal
of
his
convictions.
now
as
we
developed
in
our
brief
of
last
term,
and
as
professor
wright
concedes,
no
objection
was
made
on
this
court
until
after
the
jury's
verdict
was
handed
down
even
though
counsel
was
apprised
with
the
fact
that
there'd
been
some
communication
between
the
jury
and
the
judge
and
was
apprised
of
this
not
too
long
after
the
matter
had
occurred.
now
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
here
that
the
judge
plainly
stated
that
the
note
that
he
received
was
one
--
it
was
identical
to
a
later
note
that
is
part
of
the
record.
a
later
note
that
was
--
that
is
part
of
the
record
was
a
notification
to
the
judge
that
the
jury
was
deadlocked
and
a
request
for
instructions.
the
judge's
response
was
for
them
to
continue
to
work.
he
stated
when
the
matter
of
this
first
note
was
brought
to
his
attention,
that
the
first
note
was
substantially
the
same,
that
his
response
had
been
substantially
the
same.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
rule
that
the
petitioner
really
contends
for
is
that
reversal
is
required
whenever
there
is
a
communication
between
the
judge
and
the
jury
outside
of
a
defendant's
presence
unless
the
absence
of
any
prejudice
can
be
conclusively
shown.
now,
whatever
the
rule
might
be
as
to
a
situation
where
the
defendant
has
seasonably
obected
and
this
isn't
just
a
procedural
requirement
if
he
objects
prior
to
the
verdict,
a
matter
can
be
explored
at
the
time
when
it
makes
some
difference.
but
if
he
waits
until
after
the
verdict
comes
down
and
then
raises
the
matter,
he's
effectively
preserved
his
option.
he
finds
out
what
the
verdict
is
and
then
he
makes
the
objection
if
it
goes
against
him.
we
don't'
think
that's
required.
it
seems
to
us
also
that
despite
all
the
horribles
that
are
stated
in
petitioner's
brief
that
the
substance
of
the
second
note
here
itself
which
is
part
of
the
record
indicates
that
nothing
very
untoward
could
have
gone
on
with
respect
to
the
prior
communication
because
the
notice
is
simply
a
request
--
a
notification
that
the
jury
is
deadlocked
in
a
request
for
instructions.
we
think
therefore
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
err
in
his
treatment
of
the
note
under
the
circumstances
here
and
that
this
ground
provides
no
basis
for
a
reversal.
now
as
to
the
fifth
amendment
claim,
at
an
earlier
point
in
these
cases,
the
argument
was
developed
that
kahriger
and
lewis
didn't
speak
to
the
excise
tax
problem.
and
that's
true
in
the
sense
that
kahriger
and
lewis
both
where
cases
involving
the
registration
requirement
in
the
special
occupational
term
as
distinguished
from
the
excise
tax.
as
i
pointed
out
previously,
one
of
the
views
of
kahriger
and
lewis
is
that
--
it
was
--
they
were
grounded
on
the
consideration
that
the
registration
requirement
was
only
prospective
in
operation.
as
professor
wright
directly
points
out,
this
argument
cannot
be
made
with
respect
to
the
excise
tax
return.
we
point
out
that
we
think
both
kahriger
and
lewis
can
be
read
not
as
standing
solely
on
this
perspective
retrospective
ground
but
on
the
question
of
whether
there's
any
compelled
information
in
the
fifth
amendment
sentence.
i
don't
want
to
go
back
through
a
familiar
ground.
we've
been
through
that
several
times.
but
i
do
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
excise
tax
return,
the
non-taxpayer
of
the
excise
tax
just
like
the
non-registrant
for
the
special
occupational
tax
is
free
to
choose
whether
he
wants
to
gamble
or
not.
our
position
is
that
kahriger
and
lewis
properly
understood
all
that
when
he
decides
to
gamble,
he
has
made
a
choice
to
accept
the
federal
tax
conditions
that
are
attached.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
the
argument
could
be
carried
to
that
extreme.
if
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
then
the
argument
makes
no
sense.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
to
the
burglar,
his
situation
is
this.
he
knows
that
if
he
commits
a
burglary,
it's
against
the
law
and
he
might
get
himself
into
difficulty.
the
gambler
knows
the
same
thing
as
to
state
law.
he
also
knows
another
thing.
he
knows
there's
a
federal
tax.
we're
not
saying
that
he
waves
the
privilege
when
he
decides
to
gamble
as
to
the
substantive
offense.
we're
saying
that
kahriger
and
lewis,
the
rationale
there
is
that
--
as
to
federal
tax
conditions,
he
waives
his
privilege
because
he's
accepted
them
so
to
speak
as
part
of
his
decision
to
engage
in
that.
now,
if
you
had
a
tax
on
burglars
which
was
discussed
the
argument
last
term
and
which
we
have
some
question
about.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
question
would
be
whether
this
is
even
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
taxing
power
and
that
would
be
the
primary
issue
in
that
comment
--
context.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
why
wouldn't
he
be
what,
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
we've
established
that
the
taxing
power
does
have
some
limitations.
that
the
taxing
power
has
to
be
used
with
respect
to
objects
and
subjects
that
are
at
least
arguably
within
a
proper
scope
for
taxation
like
the
child
labor
tax.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
rest
on
the
consideration
of
whether
congress
is
properly
functioned
within
the
constitution.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
it
taxes
some
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
problem
is
you
--
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
simply
label
something
a
tax
and
say
that
therefore
it's
constitutionally
justified.
that
their
case
is
that
i've
considered
this
problem
but
that
the
only
purport
of
the
exercise
of
the
power
is
to
attach
a
penalty
upon
an
activity
that
congress
otherwise
couldn't
regulate
through
the
commerce
power
or
some
other
power.
and
this
court
has
questioned
whether
that's
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
tax
power.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
tax
on
embezzlement
involves
the
income
tax
and
the
question
there
is
whether
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
burglar
i
take
it
has
the
--
i
suppose,
to
pay
income
tax
on
his
income.
i
don't
know
how
many
do
it
but
the
question
is
whether
you
could
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
whether
you
can
single
out
burglary
as
an
appropriate
subject
for
taxation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
question
would
be
whether
this
was
inappropriate
way
in
which
congress
could
exercise
the
tax
power.
it
couldn't'
tax
child
labor
in
the
child
labor
tax
case
because
the
court
found
that
that
was
a
subterfuge
for
the
--
for
an
effort
to
regulate
an
activity
that
the
congress
did
not
power
to
regulate.
it
seems
to
me
a
similar
question
would
be
raised
with
respect
to
burglary.
indeed
in
kahriger,
justice
frankfurter,
his
opinion
discussed
in
length,
his
view
that
this
was
not
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
tax
power
because
it
was
just
an
attempt
to
put
a
penalty
on
gambling.
the
majority
of
the
court
rejected
that
view
but
that's
the
consideration
that
i
speak
to
when
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we're
speaking
--
i'm
speaking
in
the
context
of
an
excise
or
some
other
kind
of
special
tax
and
not
an
income
tax
which
this
court
has
held
covers
income
from
illegal
as
well
as
an
awful
sources.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
the
sullivan
rational
and
the
income
tax
context
would
apply
to
that
as
well.
sullivan
says
that
there
isn't
any
fifth
amendment
problem,
he
has
file
a
return.
what
he
says
is,
i
don't
tell
you
what
the
source
of
that
income
was
if
it's
unlawful.
but
in
an
excise
tax
context,
it
seems
to
me
i
have
a
different
--
we
have
a
different
problem.
we
developed
in
our
brief
and
the
petitioner
took
some
slaps
at
it,
the
position
that
gambling
is
a
large
and
ongoing
business
in
this
country,
well
it
is.
we
all
know
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
burglary
is
quite
as
big
as
gambling.
but
the
sole
intent
of
that
development
in
the
brief
was
that
in
response
to
the
questions
about
whether
this
tax
is
a
tax,
that
gambling
is
a
proper
subject
for
an
excise
tax.
that
when
you
tax
a
variety
of
legitimate
activities
with
excise
taxes,
why
shouldn't
illegal
activities
also
pay
a
tax?
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
kind
of
a
curious
claim
that
a
person
should
be
excused
from
taxation
because
what
he
does
is
unlawful.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
but
that's
the
--
it
seems
to
be
the
question
here
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
kind
of
tax
would
be
far
more
suspect
with
respect
to
whether
congress
really
intended
to
tax
the
activity
or
whether
it's
simply
intended
to
put
another
penalty
on
it.
fortunately,
congress
hasn't
done
that
yet.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
if
such
thing
develops,
then
we
can
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
--
first,
gambling
is
not
everywhere
unlawful.
i
take
it
burglary
is.
second,
it
seems
to
me
also
that
as
we
seek
to
develop
gambling
as
a
business,
operates
more
like
a
business
that
pays
excise
taxes
than
burglary.
and
then
your
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
point
where
the
congressional
judgment
that
was
exercised
to
place
kind
of
tax
is
one
that's
grounded
on
appropriate
tax
considerations.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
in
the
burglary
case
is
but
i
would
have
a
good
--
more
difficulty
with
that
because
of
the
nature
of
burglary.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
we're
not
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we're
speaking
--
justice
fortas
asked
about
a
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
he
asked
about
an
occupational
tax
on
burglars
and
it
was
in
that
context
that
i've
said
i
thought
burglars
were
in
a
different
situation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
think
that's
right.
it
--
the
legislative
history
develops
--
senator
keith
hoffer
was
an
opponent
of
this
legislation.
and
he
had
just
previously
completed
his
inquiry
into
organized
crime,
i
take
it
is.
and
he
said,
this
tax
is
an
ill
advice
thing
because
the
effect
of
it
will
be
to
--
in
the
mind
of
people
give
a
federal
license
so
to
speak
to
people
engaged
in
gambling.
well,
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
his
feeling
was
that
what
you
would
be
doing
here
would
be
giving
federal
approval
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
now,
petitioners
refer
to
various
statutes
that
they
say
indicate
congress
made
a
judgment
not
to
confer
any
immunity
here.
well,
section
4422
speaks
in
terms
of
this
--
the
wagering
tax
statute,
not
impairing
or
impinging
any
kind
of
prosecution
for
the
substantive
offense.
but
that
was
written
against
this
background
of
people
saying,
well,
you
shouldn't
enact
this
kind
of
tax
because
it
will
give
federal
sanctions
so
to
speak
to
illegal
activity.
one
point
that
professor
wright
makes
is
that
he
feels
that
while
our
use
restriction
accommodation
is
not
a
nonsensical
one,
he
recognizes
that
it
may
flow
from
murphy.
that
murphy
is
a
different
situation
and
it's
a
different
situation
because
there,
there
was
a
state
immunity
statute.
and
so
the
court
just
had
a
help
a
little
bit
by
putting
a
use
restriction
approach
with
respect
to
federal
incrimination.
well,
we
all
know
that
in
the
murphy
situation
the
state
itself
could
not
have
provided
immunity
from
federal
prosecution.
so,
murphy
was
a
situation
in
which
you
had
no
effective
immunity
provided.
and
the
court
--
mr.
justice
white
develops
this
at
length
from
his
concurring
opinion.
the
court
was
faced
with
the
problem
having
concluded
that
the
fifth
amendment
applied
both
to
the
states
and
the
federal
government
as
to
what
to
do
about
--
to
enter
jurisdictional
problem.
now
in
murphy,
the
court
concluded
that
this
problem
could
be
dealt
with
by
the
adoption
of
an
exclusionary
rule
that
would
protect
against
any
federal
incrimination.
now,
what
we
suggest
here
is
the
court
do
the
same
thing.
professor
wright
says,
“no.
don't
do
that.
leave
it
up
to
congress
if
they
want
to”.
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
question
is
whether
immunity
from
prosecution
completely,
total
immunity
is
appropriate.
we
submit
that
that's
not
necessary.
but
then
maybe
that
is
the
situation
in
which
the
judgment
should
be
left
up
to
congress.
but
as
professor
wright
concedes
that's
not
the
requirement
under
murphy.
and
if
it
isn't,
then
we
suggest
the
court
should
do
the
same
thing
it
did
in
murphy,
adopt
the
use
restriction
rule.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
there'd
be
too
much
of
a
problem
with
that.
i
think
they'd
all
claim
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
information
on
the
return
that
is
in
incriminatory.
there
position
is
that
the
mere
filing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
result
in
a
waiver.
that
was
thrown
out
of
one
point.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
was
a
point
i
was
going
to
put
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
alternative
really
if
this
is
a
proper
view
of
murphy
is
for
the
court
to
either
adopt
the
use
restriction
rule
and
if
congress
doesn't
like
that.
if
it
doesn't
like
the
wagering
tax
being
a
tax
measure,
then
they
can
get
rid
of
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
or
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
not
--
no,
not
at
all.
the
burden
is
on
the
government
for
showing
independent
source
and
we're
talking
about
not
just
the
use
of
the
form.
we're
talking
about
the
fact
to
filing
and
use
of
that
as
a
link
or
lead
whatever.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
we
--
in
our
brief
in
the
grosso
case
last
term,
point
out
in
footnote
10,
the
authority
and
limited
circumstances
for
the
commissioner's
disclosure
of
certain
information
that
is
not
within
6107.
it's
footnote
10
on
page
40.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
commissioner
has
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
sanction
is
there
at
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
--
i
take
it
that
the
commissioner
has
construed
those
statutes
as
concurring
on
him
in
a
limited
circumstances
the
authority
in
his
discretion
to
do
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
your
honor
the
statutes
that
we
referred
to
there.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
wagering
tax
cases
have
been
extensively
brief
and
argued
over
the
last
two
terms
here
and
i
doubt
that
in
a
few
minutes
anymore
can
be
added.
i
would
like
to
mention
that
it
seems
apparent
now
that
the
court
and
counsel
are
quite
aware
of
some
of
the
broader
implications
that
underlie
the
decisions
in
these
cases.
it's
just
not
all
that
simple.
at
the
one
extreme,
he
might
say,
“well,
part
of
the
tax
is
plenary.”
and
the
congress
can
exercise
it
in
anyway
that
it
chooses
on
any
subjects
that
it
chooses.
and
we
don't
concern
ourselves
with
fifth
amendment.
but
the
other
he
might
say,
“well
the
fifth
amendment
is
absolute.”
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
the
government
can't
violate
that
no
matter
what
parts
excise
on.
but
we
don't
think
that
either
of
those
positions
is
sound
as
we
read
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
has
taken
a
position
of
accommodation
when
flight
–
when
it's
face
put
the
clash
such
as
this.
and
our
effort
has
been
to
suggest
several
alternatives
that
we
think
would
provide
a
sensible
accommodation
in
these
cases.
as
far
as
we
know,
no
prior
decision
of
this
court
is
held
a
tax
invalid
on
fifth
amendment
grounds.
indeed,
as
far
as
we
know,
the
court
is
consistently
upheld.
excise
taxation
of
businesses
whether
they
are
illegal
or
legal.
it's
consistently
upheld
the
taxation
of
income
from
unlawful
as
well
as
lawful
sources.
we
submit
therefore
that
against
this
back
draft
of
the
president
of
sensible
accommodation
here
is
–
is
a
necessary.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
accommodation
that
we
think
we've
made
by
the
court
in
kahriger
and
lewis,
your
honor.
that
the
congress
chooses
to
tax
a
business
and
that
tax
is
an
appropriate
one.
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
when
a
person
decides
to
enter
into
that
business,
he
is
accepting
the
tax
conditions
that
have
been
placed
upon
that
–
an
engagement.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
one
way
to
stay
on
this.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
there
are
different
positions
that
could
be
developed.
professor
wright
mentioned
yesterday
that
we
suggested
just
in
passing
our
brief
that
perhaps,
one
of
the
problems
here
is
the
fact
that
forms
prescribed
are
hardly
neutral.
how
they
answer
that
we
gave
to
the
question
post
by
the
court
as
to
whether
these
forms
had
to
be
filled
out,
filed
the
presently
prescribed
forms
was,
yes.
professor
wright
apparently
feels
and
we
suggest
that
this
maybe
another
way
to
reach
this
position.
it's
not
a
way
that
seems
to
me
is
presently
often
at
the
court
because
this
kind
of
information
seems
compelled
by
the
statutes
and
the
regulations.
it
maybe
that
if
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
could
be
amended
in
appropriate
way.
this
would
be
another
way
that
the
congress
could
still
tax
in
system
with
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
there
are
some
difficulties
with
that
also
but
it
is
another
variant.
i
would
like
to
enclosing
--
just
go
quickly
back
over
what
the
substance
of
the
contention
made
here
for
unconstitutionality.
now,
petitioners
don't
deny
that
there
are
gamblers
that
essential
of
their
position.
they
don't
say
that
the
wager
and
taxes
in
a
tax
measure
because
they
recognized
that
that
was
one
of
the
questions
presented
in
the
court
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
it
was
not
taken
on
that
ground.
what
they
say
is
that
they're
excuse
from
compliance
with
the
wager
and
tax
laws
because
the
business
in
which
they're
engage
is
unlawful.
they
say
therefore,
compliance
with
these
laws
would
require
them
to
incriminate
themselves.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
–
that's
what
i
think
they
claim.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
if
gambling
where
lawful
in
nevada
as
it
is
and
these
people
lived
in
nevada.
they
would
not
be
able
to
make
the
claim
that
they
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
my
view,
it's
just
another
way
that's
the
state
the
position
that
they
take.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
–
that's
what
i
get
out
of
their
claim.
if
gambling
were
lawful
where
they
engage
in
it,
i
take
it
if
they
couldn't
make
the
claim.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
they
would
phrase
it
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
not
in
your
interest
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
i
suggested
yesterday
that
against
his
background,
at
least
some
accommodation
is
necessary.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
one
of
the
accommodations
we
suggest
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
accommodation
is
a
term
that
this
court
itself
is
used
then
it's
a
point
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
it
has
been
use
in
this
connection.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
the
murphy
case
which
we
rely
upon
as
this
authority
for
the
alternative
rational
we
suggest
that
was
indeed
the
essence
of
that
case.
the
court
said
that
in
its
view,
it
was
necessary
to
accommodate
the
state
in
a
federal
interest.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
state
compact?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
involved
the
waterfront
commission
but
witnesses
were
sought
to
be
compelled
to
testify
before
that
commission
and
they
resisted
the
inquiry
on
the
ground
that
it
might
incriminate
them
under
federal
law.
and
this
court
held
that
they
could
be
compelled
on
it,
sir.
and
that
the
fifth
amendment
didn't
prevent
that.
that
their
answers
couldn't
be
use
against
them
or
their
proofs
in
some
subsequent
prosecution
and
if
the
government
in
that
prosecution
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
its
information
and
its
evidence
was
from
an
independent
source.
and
we
suggest
these
cases
provide
a
suitable
occasion
for
similar
kind
of
rule.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
the
circumstances
in
which
fifth
amendment
claims
arise
lend
themselves
to
this
kind
of
resolution.
and
i
don't
know
that
circumstances
in
which
first
or
other
similar
claims
arise
do.
that
the
court
has
as
you
know
adopted
exclusionary
rules
in
difference
circumstances
to
provide
some
kind
of
accommodation
between
what
the
government
does
and
what
the
individual's
interest
does.
and
that's
what
they
did
in
murphy
and
we
suggest
that
that
should
be
done
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
court
has
made
this
kind
of
accommodation
in
the
past
and
we
suggest
that
it's
appropriate
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
one
way
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
say
that
he
can
be
a
witness
against
himself
but
what
he
says
can't
be
used
against
him.
if
--
if
what
he
says
cannot
be
use
to
his
detriment
in
subsequent
prosecution
then
i
don't
know
that
then
he
use
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
as
i
understand
this
court's
decisions
that
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
it
does.
the
court
has
to
--
has
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
thought
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
i
thought
that
one
of
the
functions
of
this
court
was
to
decide
those
questions
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that's
one
of
its
functions,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
our
argument
goes
beyond
what
presidents
exist
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
can't
forget
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
is
--
what
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i
take
it
when
you're
suggesting
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
confer
right
to
remain
silent.
if
that's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
to
remain
silent.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
to
say
nothing.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
that's
--
that's
what
it
does,
then
i
think
your
position
is
correct
and
ours
is
wrong.
but
we
don't
read
what
this
court
is
done
in
the
past
when
face
with
these
situations.
clash
between
a
claim
of
the
privilege
and
some
other
power
that
there
the
congress
is
seeking
to
exercise.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
that
--
that
doesn't
--
it
seems
to
me
doesn't
resolve
the
question
of
what
that
language
which
means
and
what
that
term
mean.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
difficult
as
i
mentioned
to
make
that
argument
anymore
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
your
honor,
what
the
court
has
to
do
with
any
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
is
determine
in
the
context
that
the
claim
is
made.
what
that
language
means
and
how
it
should
be
applied?
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
is
done
and
it's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
now,
that
may
not
be
the
conclusion
but
you
have
to
at
least
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
court
has
done
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
we're
not
touch
to
any
kind
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
label
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i'm
not
sure.
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
there
are
cases
justice
black
that
i
would
agree
from
placing
with
you,
if
congress
decides
to
set
up
a
particular
religion?
now,
this
court
can
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
you
can't
do
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
it
says
that.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
but
that
doesn't
carry
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
--
no.
no
person
shall
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
is
what
do?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
don't
think
that
the
murphy
rational
does
that
if
the
court
applies
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
think
murphy
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
for
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
the
lang
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
difficult
to
forget
murphy
because
it
seems
to
me
that
as
lawyers,
we
have
to
pay
attention
to
what
this
court
has
done
when
it's
been
face
with
similar
circumstances.
but
in
my
own
terms
if
that's
what
you
want,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
read
that
language
against
the
back
draft
of
what
we
suggest.
it's
difficult
to
say
that
as
part
of
a
tax
measure,
if
someone
has
to
provide
information
to
the
government
and
that
information
cannot
be
use
against
him.
any
substance
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
his
name
and
his
address
and
what
he
does,
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
not
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
question
that's
asked
is
how
much
--
whether
he
engages
in
wagering
and
how
much
money
he
makes
out
of
it?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
violates
the
law
in
some
places
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
some
places,
it
doesn't.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
some
places,
it
does.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you
would
–-
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
yeah.
well,
they
would
--
well,
first,
i
suppose
they
would
be
contending
that
i'm
lawyer
type
case
should
be
decided.
and
i
supposed
also
they'd
be
asserting
that
there
are
federal
statutes
that
relate
to
the
interstate
aspects
of
gambling.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
--
as
we
point
--
we
referred
to
these
statutes
in
our
brief.
we
point
out
that
there
you
have
different
elements
that
go
into
that
crime,
those
kind
of
crimes.
and
also,
there
maybe
some
distance
between
the
information
provided
in
the
crime
itself
but
then
you're
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
think
that
as
we
reach
shapiro
that
relates
to
records
that
an
individual
or
business
maintains.
now
i
know
that
the
term
“required
records”
has
been
placed
on
that
doctrine
and
there
is
a
language
in
that
regarding
the
opinion.
we
point
out
on
our
brief
that
the
kind
of
records
that
we're
involved
there
or
under
the
regulation
of
those
records
that
are
customarily
kept
in
that
kind
of
business.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
provides
a
sensible
view
as
to
this
scope
of
shapiro.
we
think
that
the
--
when
the
government
requires
on
the
other
hand
the
filing
of
reports
and
returns,
and
things
like
that
to
the
government
an
affirmative
coming
forth
by
an
individual.
but
there
are
different
considerations.
these
reports
wouldn't
be
filed
except
for
the
fact
that
the
government
require.
i
don't
know
where
you
start,
if
you
say
that
those
kinds
of
reports
and
returns
are
also
within
shapiro.
because
if
you
say
that
and
it
seems
to
me,
the
government
can
require
almost
any
kind
of
report
or
return
to
be
made
and
that
information
could
be
use
against
an
individual
to
prove
his
guilt
of
a
crime.
and
since
there
aren't
any
sensible
stopping
places
along
that
line
that
we
can
divide.
and
since
--
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
kind
of
thing
that
we're
talking
about
in
shapiro
and
the
kind
of
thing
involved
with
reports
and
returns.
we
don't
feel
that
the
court
has
to
reach
shapiro
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
far
as
i
know,
this
court
does
not
apply
shapiro
directly.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
as
i
said,
the
way
that
we
reach
shapiro
is
that
if
we
wage
primarily
to
those
kinds
of
things
that
are
kept
by
someone
incident
to
doing
his
business.
now,
i
take
that
none
of
these
people
would
send
things
into
the
government.
they
don't
do
it
anyhow
but
they
wouldn't
send
them
in
just
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
say
that
the
kind
of
record
you're
talking
about
is
of
the
nature
that
it
would
be
expected
to
be
kept
by
an
individual
whether
the
particular
person
kept
in
the
past
that
particular
kind
of
record
and
then
the
regulation
came
along
and
said,
“you
had
to
keep
it
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
is
of
the
necessary
test.”
it's
the
nature
of
the
thing,
what
it
is
and
how
it
relates
to
his
business
and
to
the
regulatory
program
that's
involved?
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
easy
problem.
we
took
the
position
as
the
petition
has
pointed
out
in
our
previous
brief.
that
we
didn't
think
the
shapiro
question
was
presented
here.
the
court
asked
about
it
after
considered
judgment
we
took
the
position
we've
taken.
i
think
it
is
a
sound
one.
i
share
the
difficulty
that
not
only
you
but
some
of
the
other
members
of
the
court
have
it.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
professor
wright
has
pointed
out
this
case
involves
as
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
claim
is
concerned,
failure
to
pay
the
10%
excise
tax
on
wagers
as
distinguished
from
the
$50
special
occupational
tax
that
--
and
the
registration
requirement
that
we're
involved
in
marchetti,
the
prior
case.
in
the
main
as
professor
wright
points
out,
the
position
that
the
government
takes
in
the
two
cases
is
substantially
the
same.
i
would
like
to
discuss
first,
this
other
issue
that
professor
wright
refers
to
in
passing
and
then
come
back
to
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
as
we
understand
it,
petitioner's
contention
is
that
here
the
trial
judge's
treatment
of
a
note
which
he
received
from
the
jury
was
such
that
it
required
reversal
of
his
convictions.
now
as
we
developed
in
our
brief
of
last
term,
and
as
professor
wright
concedes,
no
objection
was
made
on
this
court
until
after
the
jury's
verdict
was
handed
down
even
though
counsel
was
apprised
with
the
fact
that
there'd
been
some
communication
between
the
jury
and
the
judge
and
was
apprised
of
this
not
too
long
after
the
matter
had
occurred.
now
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
here
that
the
judge
plainly
stated
that
the
note
that
he
received
was
one
--
it
was
identical
to
a
later
note
that
is
part
of
the
record.
a
later
note
that
was
--
that
is
part
of
the
record
was
a
notification
to
the
judge
that
the
jury
was
deadlocked
and
a
request
for
instructions.
the
judge's
response
was
for
them
to
continue
to
work.
he
stated
when
the
matter
of
this
first
note
was
brought
to
his
attention,
that
the
first
note
was
substantially
the
same,
that
his
response
had
been
substantially
the
same.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
rule
that
the
petitioner
really
contends
for
is
that
reversal
is
required
whenever
there
is
a
communication
between
the
judge
and
the
jury
outside
of
a
defendant's
presence
unless
the
absence
of
any
prejudice
can
be
conclusively
shown.
now,
whatever
the
rule
might
be
as
to
a
situation
where
the
defendant
has
seasonably
obected
and
this
isn't
just
a
procedural
requirement
if
he
objects
prior
to
the
verdict,
a
matter
can
be
explored
at
the
time
when
it
makes
some
difference.
but
if
he
waits
until
after
the
verdict
comes
down
and
then
raises
the
matter,
he's
effectively
preserved
his
option.
he
finds
out
what
the
verdict
is
and
then
he
makes
the
objection
if
it
goes
against
him.
we
don't'
think
that's
required.
it
seems
to
us
also
that
despite
all
the
horribles
that
are
stated
in
petitioner's
brief
that
the
substance
of
the
second
note
here
itself
which
is
part
of
the
record
indicates
that
nothing
very
untoward
could
have
gone
on
with
respect
to
the
prior
communication
because
the
notice
is
simply
a
request
--
a
notification
that
the
jury
is
deadlocked
in
a
request
for
instructions.
we
think
therefore
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
err
in
his
treatment
of
the
note
under
the
circumstances
here
and
that
this
ground
provides
no
basis
for
a
reversal.
now
as
to
the
fifth
amendment
claim,
at
an
earlier
point
in
these
cases,
the
argument
was
developed
that
kahriger
and
lewis
didn't
speak
to
the
excise
tax
problem.
and
that's
true
in
the
sense
that
kahriger
and
lewis
both
where
cases
involving
the
registration
requirement
in
the
special
occupational
term
as
distinguished
from
the
excise
tax.
as
i
pointed
out
previously,
one
of
the
views
of
kahriger
and
lewis
is
that
--
it
was
--
they
were
grounded
on
the
consideration
that
the
registration
requirement
was
only
prospective
in
operation.
as
professor
wright
directly
points
out,
this
argument
cannot
be
made
with
respect
to
the
excise
tax
return.
we
point
out
that
we
think
both
kahriger
and
lewis
can
be
read
not
as
standing
solely
on
this
perspective
retrospective
ground
but
on
the
question
of
whether
there's
any
compelled
information
in
the
fifth
amendment
sentence.
i
don't
want
to
go
back
through
a
familiar
ground.
we've
been
through
that
several
times.
but
i
do
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
excise
tax
return,
the
non-taxpayer
of
the
excise
tax
just
like
the
non-registrant
for
the
special
occupational
tax
is
free
to
choose
whether
he
wants
to
gamble
or
not.
our
position
is
that
kahriger
and
lewis
properly
understood
all
that
when
he
decides
to
gamble,
he
has
made
a
choice
to
accept
the
federal
tax
conditions
that
are
attached.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
the
argument
could
be
carried
to
that
extreme.
if
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
then
the
argument
makes
no
sense.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
to
the
burglar,
his
situation
is
this.
he
knows
that
if
he
commits
a
burglary,
it's
against
the
law
and
he
might
get
himself
into
difficulty.
the
gambler
knows
the
same
thing
as
to
state
law.
he
also
knows
another
thing.
he
knows
there's
a
federal
tax.
we're
not
saying
that
he
waves
the
privilege
when
he
decides
to
gamble
as
to
the
substantive
offense.
we're
saying
that
kahriger
and
lewis,
the
rationale
there
is
that
--
as
to
federal
tax
conditions,
he
waives
his
privilege
because
he's
accepted
them
so
to
speak
as
part
of
his
decision
to
engage
in
that.
now,
if
you
had
a
tax
on
burglars
which
was
discussed
the
argument
last
term
and
which
we
have
some
question
about.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
question
would
be
whether
this
is
even
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
taxing
power
and
that
would
be
the
primary
issue
in
that
comment
--
context.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
why
wouldn't
he
be
what,
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
we've
established
that
the
taxing
power
does
have
some
limitations.
that
the
taxing
power
has
to
be
used
with
respect
to
objects
and
subjects
that
are
at
least
arguably
within
a
proper
scope
for
taxation
like
the
child
labor
tax.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
rest
on
the
consideration
of
whether
congress
is
properly
functioned
within
the
constitution.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
it
taxes
some
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
problem
is
you
--
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
simply
label
something
a
tax
and
say
that
therefore
it's
constitutionally
justified.
that
their
case
is
that
i've
considered
this
problem
but
that
the
only
purport
of
the
exercise
of
the
power
is
to
attach
a
penalty
upon
an
activity
that
congress
otherwise
couldn't
regulate
through
the
commerce
power
or
some
other
power.
and
this
court
has
questioned
whether
that's
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
tax
power.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
tax
on
embezzlement
involves
the
income
tax
and
the
question
there
is
whether
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
burglar
i
take
it
has
the
--
i
suppose,
to
pay
income
tax
on
his
income.
i
don't
know
how
many
do
it
but
the
question
is
whether
you
could
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
whether
you
can
single
out
burglary
as
an
appropriate
subject
for
taxation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
the
question
would
be
whether
this
was
inappropriate
way
in
which
congress
could
exercise
the
tax
power.
it
couldn't'
tax
child
labor
in
the
child
labor
tax
case
because
the
court
found
that
that
was
a
subterfuge
for
the
--
for
an
effort
to
regulate
an
activity
that
the
congress
did
not
power
to
regulate.
it
seems
to
me
a
similar
question
would
be
raised
with
respect
to
burglary.
indeed
in
kahriger,
justice
frankfurter,
his
opinion
discussed
in
length,
his
view
that
this
was
not
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
tax
power
because
it
was
just
an
attempt
to
put
a
penalty
on
gambling.
the
majority
of
the
court
rejected
that
view
but
that's
the
consideration
that
i
speak
to
when
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we're
speaking
--
i'm
speaking
in
the
context
of
an
excise
or
some
other
kind
of
special
tax
and
not
an
income
tax
which
this
court
has
held
covers
income
from
illegal
as
well
as
an
awful
sources.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
the
sullivan
rational
and
the
income
tax
context
would
apply
to
that
as
well.
sullivan
says
that
there
isn't
any
fifth
amendment
problem,
he
has
file
a
return.
what
he
says
is,
i
don't
tell
you
what
the
source
of
that
income
was
if
it's
unlawful.
but
in
an
excise
tax
context,
it
seems
to
me
i
have
a
different
--
we
have
a
different
problem.
we
developed
in
our
brief
and
the
petitioner
took
some
slaps
at
it,
the
position
that
gambling
is
a
large
and
ongoing
business
in
this
country,
well
it
is.
we
all
know
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
burglary
is
quite
as
big
as
gambling.
but
the
sole
intent
of
that
development
in
the
brief
was
that
in
response
to
the
questions
about
whether
this
tax
is
a
tax,
that
gambling
is
a
proper
subject
for
an
excise
tax.
that
when
you
tax
a
variety
of
legitimate
activities
with
excise
taxes,
why
shouldn't
illegal
activities
also
pay
a
tax?
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
kind
of
a
curious
claim
that
a
person
should
be
excused
from
taxation
because
what
he
does
is
unlawful.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
but
that's
the
--
it
seems
to
be
the
question
here
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
kind
of
tax
would
be
far
more
suspect
with
respect
to
whether
congress
really
intended
to
tax
the
activity
or
whether
it's
simply
intended
to
put
another
penalty
on
it.
fortunately,
congress
hasn't
done
that
yet.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
if
such
thing
develops,
then
we
can
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
--
first,
gambling
is
not
everywhere
unlawful.
i
take
it
burglary
is.
second,
it
seems
to
me
also
that
as
we
seek
to
develop
gambling
as
a
business,
operates
more
like
a
business
that
pays
excise
taxes
than
burglary.
and
then
your
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
point
where
the
congressional
judgment
that
was
exercised
to
place
kind
of
tax
is
one
that's
grounded
on
appropriate
tax
considerations.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
in
the
burglary
case
is
but
i
would
have
a
good
--
more
difficulty
with
that
because
of
the
nature
of
burglary.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
we're
not
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we're
speaking
--
justice
fortas
asked
about
a
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
he
asked
about
an
occupational
tax
on
burglars
and
it
was
in
that
context
that
i've
said
i
thought
burglars
were
in
a
different
situation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
think
that's
right.
it
--
the
legislative
history
develops
--
senator
keith
hoffer
was
an
opponent
of
this
legislation.
and
he
had
just
previously
completed
his
inquiry
into
organized
crime,
i
take
it
is.
and
he
said,
this
tax
is
an
ill
advice
thing
because
the
effect
of
it
will
be
to
--
in
the
mind
of
people
give
a
federal
license
so
to
speak
to
people
engaged
in
gambling.
well,
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
his
feeling
was
that
what
you
would
be
doing
here
would
be
giving
federal
approval
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
now,
petitioners
refer
to
various
statutes
that
they
say
indicate
congress
made
a
judgment
not
to
confer
any
immunity
here.
well,
section
4422
speaks
in
terms
of
this
--
the
wagering
tax
statute,
not
impairing
or
impinging
any
kind
of
prosecution
for
the
substantive
offense.
but
that
was
written
against
this
background
of
people
saying,
well,
you
shouldn't
enact
this
kind
of
tax
because
it
will
give
federal
sanctions
so
to
speak
to
illegal
activity.
one
point
that
professor
wright
makes
is
that
he
feels
that
while
our
use
restriction
accommodation
is
not
a
nonsensical
one,
he
recognizes
that
it
may
flow
from
murphy.
that
murphy
is
a
different
situation
and
it's
a
different
situation
because
there,
there
was
a
state
immunity
statute.
and
so
the
court
just
had
a
help
a
little
bit
by
putting
a
use
restriction
approach
with
respect
to
federal
incrimination.
well,
we
all
know
that
in
the
murphy
situation
the
state
itself
could
not
have
provided
immunity
from
federal
prosecution.
so,
murphy
was
a
situation
in
which
you
had
no
effective
immunity
provided.
and
the
court
--
mr.
justice
white
develops
this
at
length
from
his
concurring
opinion.
the
court
was
faced
with
the
problem
having
concluded
that
the
fifth
amendment
applied
both
to
the
states
and
the
federal
government
as
to
what
to
do
about
--
to
enter
jurisdictional
problem.
now
in
murphy,
the
court
concluded
that
this
problem
could
be
dealt
with
by
the
adoption
of
an
exclusionary
rule
that
would
protect
against
any
federal
incrimination.
now,
what
we
suggest
here
is
the
court
do
the
same
thing.
professor
wright
says,
“no.
don't
do
that.
leave
it
up
to
congress
if
they
want
to”.
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
question
is
whether
immunity
from
prosecution
completely,
total
immunity
is
appropriate.
we
submit
that
that's
not
necessary.
but
then
maybe
that
is
the
situation
in
which
the
judgment
should
be
left
up
to
congress.
but
as
professor
wright
concedes
that's
not
the
requirement
under
murphy.
and
if
it
isn't,
then
we
suggest
the
court
should
do
the
same
thing
it
did
in
murphy,
adopt
the
use
restriction
rule.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
there'd
be
too
much
of
a
problem
with
that.
i
think
they'd
all
claim
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
information
on
the
return
that
is
in
incriminatory.
there
position
is
that
the
mere
filing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
result
in
a
waiver.
that
was
thrown
out
of
one
point.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
was
a
point
i
was
going
to
put
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
alternative
really
if
this
is
a
proper
view
of
murphy
is
for
the
court
to
either
adopt
the
use
restriction
rule
and
if
congress
doesn't
like
that.
if
it
doesn't
like
the
wagering
tax
being
a
tax
measure,
then
they
can
get
rid
of
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
or
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
not
--
no,
not
at
all.
the
burden
is
on
the
government
for
showing
independent
source
and
we're
talking
about
not
just
the
use
of
the
form.
we're
talking
about
the
fact
to
filing
and
use
of
that
as
a
link
or
lead
whatever.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
we
--
in
our
brief
in
the
grosso
case
last
term,
point
out
in
footnote
10,
the
authority
and
limited
circumstances
for
the
commissioner's
disclosure
of
certain
information
that
is
not
within
6107.
it's
footnote
10
on
page
40.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
commissioner
has
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
sanction
is
there
at
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
--
i
take
it
that
the
commissioner
has
construed
those
statutes
as
concurring
on
him
in
a
limited
circumstances
the
authority
in
his
discretion
to
do
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
your
honor
the
statutes
that
we
referred
to
there.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
wagering
tax
cases
have
been
extensively
brief
and
argued
over
the
last
two
terms
here
and
i
doubt
that
in
a
few
minutes
anymore
can
be
added.
i
would
like
to
mention
that
it
seems
apparent
now
that
the
court
and
counsel
are
quite
aware
of
some
of
the
broader
implications
that
underlie
the
decisions
in
these
cases.
it's
just
not
all
that
simple.
at
the
one
extreme,
he
might
say,
“well,
part
of
the
tax
is
plenary.”
and
the
congress
can
exercise
it
in
anyway
that
it
chooses
on
any
subjects
that
it
chooses.
and
we
don't
concern
ourselves
with
fifth
amendment.
but
the
other
he
might
say,
“well
the
fifth
amendment
is
absolute.”
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
the
government
can't
violate
that
no
matter
what
parts
excise
on.
but
we
don't
think
that
either
of
those
positions
is
sound
as
we
read
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
has
taken
a
position
of
accommodation
when
flight
–
when
it's
face
put
the
clash
such
as
this.
and
our
effort
has
been
to
suggest
several
alternatives
that
we
think
would
provide
a
sensible
accommodation
in
these
cases.
as
far
as
we
know,
no
prior
decision
of
this
court
is
held
a
tax
invalid
on
fifth
amendment
grounds.
indeed,
as
far
as
we
know,
the
court
is
consistently
upheld.
excise
taxation
of
businesses
whether
they
are
illegal
or
legal.
it's
consistently
upheld
the
taxation
of
income
from
unlawful
as
well
as
lawful
sources.
we
submit
therefore
that
against
this
back
draft
of
the
president
of
sensible
accommodation
here
is
–
is
a
necessary.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
accommodation
that
we
think
we've
made
by
the
court
in
kahriger
and
lewis,
your
honor.
that
the
congress
chooses
to
tax
a
business
and
that
tax
is
an
appropriate
one.
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
when
a
person
decides
to
enter
into
that
business,
he
is
accepting
the
tax
conditions
that
have
been
placed
upon
that
–
an
engagement.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
one
way
to
stay
on
this.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
there
are
different
positions
that
could
be
developed.
professor
wright
mentioned
yesterday
that
we
suggested
just
in
passing
our
brief
that
perhaps,
one
of
the
problems
here
is
the
fact
that
forms
prescribed
are
hardly
neutral.
how
they
answer
that
we
gave
to
the
question
post
by
the
court
as
to
whether
these
forms
had
to
be
filled
out,
filed
the
presently
prescribed
forms
was,
yes.
professor
wright
apparently
feels
and
we
suggest
that
this
maybe
another
way
to
reach
this
position.
it's
not
a
way
that
seems
to
me
is
presently
often
at
the
court
because
this
kind
of
information
seems
compelled
by
the
statutes
and
the
regulations.
it
maybe
that
if
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
could
be
amended
in
appropriate
way.
this
would
be
another
way
that
the
congress
could
still
tax
in
system
with
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
there
are
some
difficulties
with
that
also
but
it
is
another
variant.
i
would
like
to
enclosing
--
just
go
quickly
back
over
what
the
substance
of
the
contention
made
here
for
unconstitutionality.
now,
petitioners
don't
deny
that
there
are
gamblers
that
essential
of
their
position.
they
don't
say
that
the
wager
and
taxes
in
a
tax
measure
because
they
recognized
that
that
was
one
of
the
questions
presented
in
the
court
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
it
was
not
taken
on
that
ground.
what
they
say
is
that
they're
excuse
from
compliance
with
the
wager
and
tax
laws
because
the
business
in
which
they're
engage
is
unlawful.
they
say
therefore,
compliance
with
these
laws
would
require
them
to
incriminate
themselves.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
–
that's
what
i
think
they
claim.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
if
gambling
where
lawful
in
nevada
as
it
is
and
these
people
lived
in
nevada.
they
would
not
be
able
to
make
the
claim
that
they
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
my
view,
it's
just
another
way
that's
the
state
the
position
that
they
take.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
–
that's
what
i
get
out
of
their
claim.
if
gambling
were
lawful
where
they
engage
in
it,
i
take
it
if
they
couldn't
make
the
claim.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
they
would
phrase
it
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
not
in
your
interest
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
i
suggested
yesterday
that
against
his
background,
at
least
some
accommodation
is
necessary.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
one
of
the
accommodations
we
suggest
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
accommodation
is
a
term
that
this
court
itself
is
used
then
it's
a
point
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
it
has
been
use
in
this
connection.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
the
murphy
case
which
we
rely
upon
as
this
authority
for
the
alternative
rational
we
suggest
that
was
indeed
the
essence
of
that
case.
the
court
said
that
in
its
view,
it
was
necessary
to
accommodate
the
state
in
a
federal
interest.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
state
compact?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
involved
the
waterfront
commission
but
witnesses
were
sought
to
be
compelled
to
testify
before
that
commission
and
they
resisted
the
inquiry
on
the
ground
that
it
might
incriminate
them
under
federal
law.
and
this
court
held
that
they
could
be
compelled
on
it,
sir.
and
that
the
fifth
amendment
didn't
prevent
that.
that
their
answers
couldn't
be
use
against
them
or
their
proofs
in
some
subsequent
prosecution
and
if
the
government
in
that
prosecution
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
its
information
and
its
evidence
was
from
an
independent
source.
and
we
suggest
these
cases
provide
a
suitable
occasion
for
similar
kind
of
rule.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
the
circumstances
in
which
fifth
amendment
claims
arise
lend
themselves
to
this
kind
of
resolution.
and
i
don't
know
that
circumstances
in
which
first
or
other
similar
claims
arise
do.
that
the
court
has
as
you
know
adopted
exclusionary
rules
in
difference
circumstances
to
provide
some
kind
of
accommodation
between
what
the
government
does
and
what
the
individual's
interest
does.
and
that's
what
they
did
in
murphy
and
we
suggest
that
that
should
be
done
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
court
has
made
this
kind
of
accommodation
in
the
past
and
we
suggest
that
it's
appropriate
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
one
way
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
say
that
he
can
be
a
witness
against
himself
but
what
he
says
can't
be
used
against
him.
if
--
if
what
he
says
cannot
be
use
to
his
detriment
in
subsequent
prosecution
then
i
don't
know
that
then
he
use
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
as
i
understand
this
court's
decisions
that
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
it
does.
the
court
has
to
--
has
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
thought
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
i
thought
that
one
of
the
functions
of
this
court
was
to
decide
those
questions
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that's
one
of
its
functions,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
our
argument
goes
beyond
what
presidents
exist
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
can't
forget
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
is
--
what
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i
take
it
when
you're
suggesting
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
confer
right
to
remain
silent.
if
that's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
to
remain
silent.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
to
say
nothing.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
that's
--
that's
what
it
does,
then
i
think
your
position
is
correct
and
ours
is
wrong.
but
we
don't
read
what
this
court
is
done
in
the
past
when
face
with
these
situations.
clash
between
a
claim
of
the
privilege
and
some
other
power
that
there
the
congress
is
seeking
to
exercise.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
that
--
that
doesn't
--
it
seems
to
me
doesn't
resolve
the
question
of
what
that
language
which
means
and
what
that
term
mean.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
difficult
as
i
mentioned
to
make
that
argument
anymore
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
your
honor,
what
the
court
has
to
do
with
any
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
is
determine
in
the
context
that
the
claim
is
made.
what
that
language
means
and
how
it
should
be
applied?
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
is
done
and
it's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
now,
that
may
not
be
the
conclusion
but
you
have
to
at
least
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
court
has
done
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
we're
not
touch
to
any
kind
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
label
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i'm
not
sure.
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
there
are
cases
justice
black
that
i
would
agree
from
placing
with
you,
if
congress
decides
to
set
up
a
particular
religion?
now,
this
court
can
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
you
can't
do
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
it
says
that.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
but
that
doesn't
carry
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
--
no.
no
person
shall
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
is
what
do?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
don't
think
that
the
murphy
rational
does
that
if
the
court
applies
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
think
murphy
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
for
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
the
lang
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
difficult
to
forget
murphy
because
it
seems
to
me
that
as
lawyers,
we
have
to
pay
attention
to
what
this
court
has
done
when
it's
been
face
with
similar
circumstances.
but
in
my
own
terms
if
that's
what
you
want,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
read
that
language
against
the
back
draft
of
what
we
suggest.
it's
difficult
to
say
that
as
part
of
a
tax
measure,
if
someone
has
to
provide
information
to
the
government
and
that
information
cannot
be
use
against
him.
any
substance
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
his
name
and
his
address
and
what
he
does,
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
not
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
question
that's
asked
is
how
much
--
whether
he
engages
in
wagering
and
how
much
money
he
makes
out
of
it?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
violates
the
law
in
some
places
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
some
places,
it
doesn't.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
some
places,
it
does.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you
would
–-
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
yeah.
well,
they
would
--
well,
first,
i
suppose
they
would
be
contending
that
i'm
lawyer
type
case
should
be
decided.
and
i
supposed
also
they'd
be
asserting
that
there
are
federal
statutes
that
relate
to
the
interstate
aspects
of
gambling.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
--
as
we
point
--
we
referred
to
these
statutes
in
our
brief.
we
point
out
that
there
you
have
different
elements
that
go
into
that
crime,
those
kind
of
crimes.
and
also,
there
maybe
some
distance
between
the
information
provided
in
the
crime
itself
but
then
you're
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
think
that
as
we
reach
shapiro
that
relates
to
records
that
an
individual
or
business
maintains.
now
i
know
that
the
term
“required
records”
has
been
placed
on
that
doctrine
and
there
is
a
language
in
that
regarding
the
opinion.
we
point
out
on
our
brief
that
the
kind
of
records
that
we're
involved
there
or
under
the
regulation
of
those
records
that
are
customarily
kept
in
that
kind
of
business.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
provides
a
sensible
view
as
to
this
scope
of
shapiro.
we
think
that
the
--
when
the
government
requires
on
the
other
hand
the
filing
of
reports
and
returns,
and
things
like
that
to
the
government
an
affirmative
coming
forth
by
an
individual.
but
there
are
different
considerations.
these
reports
wouldn't
be
filed
except
for
the
fact
that
the
government
require.
i
don't
know
where
you
start,
if
you
say
that
those
kinds
of
reports
and
returns
are
also
within
shapiro.
because
if
you
say
that
and
it
seems
to
me,
the
government
can
require
almost
any
kind
of
report
or
return
to
be
made
and
that
information
could
be
use
against
an
individual
to
prove
his
guilt
of
a
crime.
and
since
there
aren't
any
sensible
stopping
places
along
that
line
that
we
can
divide.
and
since
--
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
kind
of
thing
that
we're
talking
about
in
shapiro
and
the
kind
of
thing
involved
with
reports
and
returns.
we
don't
feel
that
the
court
has
to
reach
shapiro
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
far
as
i
know,
this
court
does
not
apply
shapiro
directly.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
as
i
said,
the
way
that
we
reach
shapiro
is
that
if
we
wage
primarily
to
those
kinds
of
things
that
are
kept
by
someone
incident
to
doing
his
business.
now,
i
take
that
none
of
these
people
would
send
things
into
the
government.
they
don't
do
it
anyhow
but
they
wouldn't
send
them
in
just
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
say
that
the
kind
of
record
you're
talking
about
is
of
the
nature
that
it
would
be
expected
to
be
kept
by
an
individual
whether
the
particular
person
kept
in
the
past
that
particular
kind
of
record
and
then
the
regulation
came
along
and
said,
“you
had
to
keep
it
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
is
of
the
necessary
test.”
it's
the
nature
of
the
thing,
what
it
is
and
how
it
relates
to
his
business
and
to
the
regulatory
program
that's
involved?
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
easy
problem.
we
took
the
position
as
the
petition
has
pointed
out
in
our
previous
brief.
that
we
didn't
think
the
shapiro
question
was
presented
here.
the
court
asked
about
it
after
considered
judgment
we
took
the
position
we've
taken.
i
think
it
is
a
sound
one.
i
share
the
difficulty
that
not
only
you
but
some
of
the
other
members
of
the
court
have
it.
thank
you.
