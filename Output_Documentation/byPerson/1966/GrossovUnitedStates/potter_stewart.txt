justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wright
just
for
curiosity,
why
aren't
you
attacking
the
--
the
stamp
--
the
registering
tax
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
just
a
motion
raised
against
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
a
timely
fashion.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
--
what
you
mean
is
involves
the
seperation
authority,
you
mean
the
recreation
of
an
immunity
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
since
we
have
fashioned
in
the
murphy
waterfront
situation,
a
prohibition
where
there
is
an
immunity
statute
to
that
report,
there
was
a
state
immunity
statute.
the
use
either
in
evidence
of
what
it
disclosed
on
the
strength
of
the
immunity
granted
or
evidence
which
is
obtained
from
leads,
from
letters
disclosed
on
the
strength
of
immunity,
that's
right.
now,
you're
not
suggesting
there
was
any
problem
of
separation
of
powers
as
today?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
may
be
wrong
mr.
wright
but
i
thought
all
that
the
mr.
beytagh
was
suggesting
that
as
an
alternative,
say
that
disclosure
maybe
made
and
still
be
required
on
registration
in
any
event.
and
i
take
it
the
same
would
apply
to
the
excise
tax.
but
that,
neither
state
not
federal
court
could
prosecute
on
the
basis
of
evidence
displayed
or
on
the
basis
of
evidence
obtained
from
leads
from
exposure.
i
thought
that
as
far
as
what
mr.
beytagh
went.
now,
i
don't
understand
is
where
the
separation
problems
arises?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
would
that
had
been
the
same
in
murphy
and
the
waterfront?
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
can
stay
together.
justice
potter
stewart
but
may
i
speak
to
it?
i
think
we
were
told
that
the
registration
made
by
the
statute
that
it
was
wrote,
a
matter
of
public
record.
how
about
the
gross
receipts,
the
excise
tax,
is
that
a
matter
of
public
interest?
justice
potter
stewart
on
request?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
then
there's
no
such
secrecy
provision
applicable
with
these
returns
as
i
understand.
they're
supposed
to
be
applicable
generally
to
our
personal
income
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
well
yeah,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
prior
the
day
or
night
when
this
is
filed,
why
wasn't
the
counsel
there?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
communication?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
and
is
there,
there
--
is
there
any
indications
the
record
show
where
the
counsel
was?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
had
the
jury
had
been
deliberating
at
that
time?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
thursday
morning?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
tax
of
10%
on
the
gross
amounts
received
by
the
taxpayers
as
wagers,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
including
layoffs
from
other
gambler?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
two
--
two
is
then
taxed.
justice
potter
stewart
as
10%
on
the
gross
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
let
me
ask
you
again,
how
does
it
fits
in
with
the
ordinary
income
tax
which
of
course
its
not
involved
here
and
in
which
is
recognized
that
a
gambler
like
anybody
else
pays,
he's
obligated
to
pay
tax
on
its
taxable
income?
justice
potter
stewart
which
he
passed
on
to
the
customer.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
if
you
fight,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
twenty
dollars
plus
tax,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
or
on
the
pari-mutuel.
justice
potter
stewart
or
on
a
pari-mutuel
estate
tax
on
a
pari-mutuel
risk.
justice
potter
stewart
has
--
has
it
ever
been?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
much
gross
revenue
has
this
produced?
did
i
hear
a
$100
million
for
15
years?
justice
potter
stewart
a
$100
million
over
15-year
period?
justice
potter
stewart
12-year
period.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
point
was
made
though
was
it
not?
that
on
--
with
respect
to
the
income
tax
filed
that
there
is
a
requirement
that
you
put
down
the
source
of
the
income.
nonetheless,
if
i
reported
the
next
day
from
15
accurately
my
wages
but
put
down
my
employers
to
the
united
states'
government
as
argentina
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
argentina,
but
i
have
made
a
full
and
complete
and
accurate
disclosure
of
my
gross
and
that
income
and
computed
it
all
very
accurately
and
send
it
in.
i
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
any
criminal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
was
the
point
it
was
made.
i'm
not
sure
--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
now
about
the
income
tax
not
the
excise
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
if
that
--
that
argument
can
be
made
--
could
be
made,
if
it's
a
--
it's
a
good
argument.
it
could
be
made
--
in
any
cases
involving
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
couldn't
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
to
be
a
burglar.
you
don't
have
to
commit
a
rape.
you
don't'
have
to
murder
somebody.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
do
you
wave
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
would
be
an
opponent
of
--
it
was
senator
(inaudible)
an
opponent
of
both
the
statutes
--
both
was
wanting
the
occupational
stamp
as
well
as
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
excise
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
purporting
to
give
a
federal
license
to
get
it
them
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
gambling.
