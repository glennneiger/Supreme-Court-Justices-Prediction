justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
would
you
obtain
–
provide
for
immunity
from
the
use
as
an
investigatory
relief?
justice
abe
fortas
we
have
here
before
held
that
i
believe
that
just
getting
the
information
which
starts
the
investigation
is
in
evidentiary
tint
or
is
a
tint
in
the
sense
in
which
you
are
using
the
term?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'm
trying
to
get
at
what
you're
suggesting
when
you
talked
about
an
immunity
from
use
as
a
lead
to
criminal
investigation.
when
you
talk
about
that,
you
talk
about
something
new,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
can't
see.
i
have
that
claim
--
justice
abe
fortas
i've
been
trying
to
think
of
some
instance
where
that's
been
done
and
i
haven't
succeeded.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
it's
the
other
side
of
the
point.
you're
suggesting
that
i
--
that
i'm
having
trouble
with
that.
i
don't
know
of
any
immunity
statute
or
any
ruling
of
this
court
that
has
the
effect
of
insulating
the
information
or
the
answer,
the
information
filed
or
the
answer
from
use
of
insulating
that
from
use
as
an
investigatory
relief?
you
are
suggesting
that
that
would
be
necessary
here
for
constitutionality
as
well
as
the
exclusion
of
the
information
in
the
proofs
thereof
from
evidentiary
use.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mclaughlin,
excuse
me.
it's
not
entirely
pertinent
to
your
case.
are
there
other
statutes
in
which
registration
is
required
mixed
with
excise
taxes?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
then
by
saying
congress
has
refused
to
supply
additional
agents
for
this
purpose?
you
know
the
congress
didn't
--
does
the
bureau
allocate
--
does
the
service
allocate
agents
to
the
enforcement
of
this
tax
or
it
doesn't?
justice
abe
fortas
where
and
when?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
there
were
an
excise
tax
on
receiving
stolen
property,
profits
from
this
--
the
business
overseeing
stolen
property
and
that
the
tax
were
precisely
the
same
as
this
in
terms
of
its
administration.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
they
constitute
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
--
why
would
you
have
more
difficulty?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
the
fact
that
you
have
more
difficulty
some
of
which
i
supervise
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what's
difference
in
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
many
--
justice
abe
fortas
oh
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
i
know
--
that
always
bothers
me
when
you
and
your
colleague
said
that.
but
–
in
on
how
many
states
is
some
form
of
wagering
covered
by
the
statute
lawful?
do
you
have
that?
justice
abe
fortas
in
new
hampshire's,
in
new
hamsphire
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
wagering?
justice
abe
fortas
so
far
as
you
can
--
so
far
as
you
can
tell
us
now,
there
is
only
one
state
that
has
in
which
wagering
of
the
sort
to
which
a
statute
applies
in
which
the
activity
is
lawful.
justice
abe
fortas
just
one
state?
justice
abe
fortas
unless
there's
a
key
part
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
this
is
the
key
part
of
your
case
right
now
or
--
and
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that's
part
of
your
argument
anyway.
you're
telling
us
that
this
causes
your
last
pain
and
agony
to
the
constantine
tax
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that
is
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
it's
very
important
for
us
now
to
have
answer
to
this
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
why
do
you
have
to
say,
i,
i
embezzle
this?
justice
abe
fortas
well
allow
me
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
that
a
man
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
some
other
state
or
some
state
where
wagering
is
illegal,
suppose
you
file
an
income
tax
and
suppose
special
agent
went
around
or
you
were
ask
in
court
whether
he
obtained
any
of
his
income
from
unlawful
wagering
or
from
engaging
in
wagering.
would
he
be
able
to
say
or
refuse
to
answer
the
question?
justice
abe
fortas
in
court
or
to
a
special
agent
or
you
name
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
assume
arguendo
–
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
--
he
could
claim
the
fifth
amendment,
couldn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
what
are
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
the
real
question
is,
is
this
the
kind
of
tax
that
is
permissible
it
seems
to
me
in
light
of
the
fifth
amendment.
for
example,
suppose
again
the
federal
government
levied
an
excise
tax
on
the
illegal
--
on
receiving
a
stolen
goods
in
that
business.
now,
that's
your
--
what
would
be
your
position
on
this?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
take
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
can't
--
he's
not
allowed
to
do
that
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
tell
me
--
tell
me
a
bit
more
about
these
intensive
facts
of
this
case.
the
petitioner
did
not
file
a
return
in
which
complied
with
the
statute,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
government
discovered
throughout
the
means
claimed
that
your
decision
without
the
means
that
he
had
engaged
in
the
business
of
wagering
and
that
he
should
have
paid
an
excise
tax.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you
did
was
to
that
failure
to
pay?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
would
he
pay
his
tax,
just
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
he
would
have
to
in
the
case
you
put
relating
only
to
an
income
tax
that
a
professional
gambler
would
have
to
respond
to
that
question
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
would
he
have
to
respond
to
that
here
then?
justice
abe
fortas
did
i
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
but
i
thought
you
just
said
that
the
fifth
amendment
--
that
form
1040
may
appropriately
ask
for
the
source
of
income
and
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
no
defense
to
a
person
engaged
in
illegal
gambling
who
fail
to
fill
in
that.
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
know.
i
wouldn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
this
excise
tax
were
set
up
so
that
it
worked
like
a
real
estate
transfer
tax
that
mr.
zeldes
once
described
in
trust.
i
mean,
this
go
to
the
post
office
and
you
buy
an
excess
tax
stamps
and
then
you
keep
them
in
your
possession
so
that
they
can
be
produced
upon
(inaudible).
now,
would
that
--
and
your
opinion
be
upfront
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
number
of
your
difficult
--
the
umber
of
your
contention
here
relates
to
the
disclosures
that
have
to
be
made
to
the
government,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
those
disclosures
are
the
name
of
the
person
stressed
in
the
fact
that
he
is
engaged
in
unlawful
gambling.
is
that
correct
in
this
case
as
distinguished
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
from
marchetti?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
position
is
that
if
those
--
that
if
a
statutory
scheme
were
devised
with
what
--
to
avoid
those
infirmities
that
that
would
not
run
a
file
on
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
fact
that
this
is
--
suppose
the
fact
that
this
is
a
particularized
tax
on
wagers,
the
excise
tax
on
wagers
as
distinguished
from
an
excise
tax
on
driving
an
automobile
or
something
like
that
is
not
really
the
part
of
your
position
here,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
not
of
its
--
levied
as
a
particularized
tax
on
wagering
because
unless
i
--
you
allowed
me
to
mislead
you
which
i've
been
--
i
felt
like
you
did
or
would.
you
have
just
said
that
if
this
same
wagering
tax
were
levied,
assessed
and
administered
on
the
basis
which
did
not
require
disclosure
it
would
not
qualify
under
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
between
the
burglary
case
in
this
case,
you
can
constitutionally
make
a
person
buy
--
pay
an
occupational
tax
could
be
a
gambler,
why
can't
you
make
them
compare
an
occupational
tax
to
be
a
burglar?
he's
got
to
post
a
stamp
saying
i'm
engage
--
in
fact,
i
am
engaged
in
the
business
of
unlawful
gambling
or
are
you
--
why
can't
you
make
him
post
the
tax
because
i'm
engaged
--
the
unlawful
business
of
burglaring
houses?
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
the
theory
the
same.
well,
i'm
not
asking
an
idle
question.
isn't
the
theory,
one
for
theory
be
the
same
in
the
case
of
a
burglars
as
in
the
case
of
a
gambler
in
terms
of
impact
of
the
fifth
amendment.
both
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
cases
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
both
cases
you're
acquiring
incidental
to
a
tax
scheme
a
person
to
disclose
that
he
is
engaged
in
an
unlawful
occupation.
whether
the
unlawful
occupation
of
burglaring
houses
or
a
place
or
--
in
the
business
of
wagering,
i
suggest
that
yourt
comment
may
not
make
any
difference.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
would
you
obtain
–
provide
for
immunity
from
the
use
as
an
investigatory
relief?
justice
abe
fortas
we
have
here
before
held
that
i
believe
that
just
getting
the
information
which
starts
the
investigation
is
in
evidentiary
tint
or
is
a
tint
in
the
sense
in
which
you
are
using
the
term?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'm
trying
to
get
at
what
you're
suggesting
when
you
talked
about
an
immunity
from
use
as
a
lead
to
criminal
investigation.
when
you
talk
about
that,
you
talk
about
something
new,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
can't
see.
i
have
that
claim
--
justice
abe
fortas
i've
been
trying
to
think
of
some
instance
where
that's
been
done
and
i
haven't
succeeded.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
it's
the
other
side
of
the
point.
you're
suggesting
that
i
--
that
i'm
having
trouble
with
that.
i
don't
know
of
any
immunity
statute
or
any
ruling
of
this
court
that
has
the
effect
of
insulating
the
information
or
the
answer,
the
information
filed
or
the
answer
from
use
of
insulating
that
from
use
as
an
investigatory
relief?
you
are
suggesting
that
that
would
be
necessary
here
for
constitutionality
as
well
as
the
exclusion
of
the
information
in
the
proofs
thereof
from
evidentiary
use.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mclaughlin,
excuse
me.
it's
not
entirely
pertinent
to
your
case.
are
there
other
statutes
in
which
registration
is
required
mixed
with
excise
taxes?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
then
by
saying
congress
has
refused
to
supply
additional
agents
for
this
purpose?
you
know
the
congress
didn't
--
does
the
bureau
allocate
--
does
the
service
allocate
agents
to
the
enforcement
of
this
tax
or
it
doesn't?
justice
abe
fortas
where
and
when?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
there
were
an
excise
tax
on
receiving
stolen
property,
profits
from
this
--
the
business
overseeing
stolen
property
and
that
the
tax
were
precisely
the
same
as
this
in
terms
of
its
administration.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
they
constitute
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
--
why
would
you
have
more
difficulty?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
the
fact
that
you
have
more
difficulty
some
of
which
i
supervise
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what's
difference
in
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
many
--
justice
abe
fortas
oh
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
i
know
--
that
always
bothers
me
when
you
and
your
colleague
said
that.
but
–
in
on
how
many
states
is
some
form
of
wagering
covered
by
the
statute
lawful?
do
you
have
that?
justice
abe
fortas
in
new
hampshire's,
in
new
hamsphire
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
wagering?
justice
abe
fortas
so
far
as
you
can
--
so
far
as
you
can
tell
us
now,
there
is
only
one
state
that
has
in
which
wagering
of
the
sort
to
which
a
statute
applies
in
which
the
activity
is
lawful.
justice
abe
fortas
just
one
state?
justice
abe
fortas
unless
there's
a
key
part
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
this
is
the
key
part
of
your
case
right
now
or
--
and
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that's
part
of
your
argument
anyway.
you're
telling
us
that
this
causes
your
last
pain
and
agony
to
the
constantine
tax
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that
is
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
it's
very
important
for
us
now
to
have
answer
to
this
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
why
do
you
have
to
say,
i,
i
embezzle
this?
justice
abe
fortas
well
allow
me
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
that
a
man
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
some
other
state
or
some
state
where
wagering
is
illegal,
suppose
you
file
an
income
tax
and
suppose
special
agent
went
around
or
you
were
ask
in
court
whether
he
obtained
any
of
his
income
from
unlawful
wagering
or
from
engaging
in
wagering.
would
he
be
able
to
say
or
refuse
to
answer
the
question?
justice
abe
fortas
in
court
or
to
a
special
agent
or
you
name
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
assume
arguendo
–
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
--
he
could
claim
the
fifth
amendment,
couldn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
what
are
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
the
real
question
is,
is
this
the
kind
of
tax
that
is
permissible
it
seems
to
me
in
light
of
the
fifth
amendment.
for
example,
suppose
again
the
federal
government
levied
an
excise
tax
on
the
illegal
--
on
receiving
a
stolen
goods
in
that
business.
now,
that's
your
--
what
would
be
your
position
on
this?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
take
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
can't
--
he's
not
allowed
to
do
that
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
tell
me
--
tell
me
a
bit
more
about
these
intensive
facts
of
this
case.
the
petitioner
did
not
file
a
return
in
which
complied
with
the
statute,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
government
discovered
throughout
the
means
claimed
that
your
decision
without
the
means
that
he
had
engaged
in
the
business
of
wagering
and
that
he
should
have
paid
an
excise
tax.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you
did
was
to
that
failure
to
pay?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
would
he
pay
his
tax,
just
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
he
would
have
to
in
the
case
you
put
relating
only
to
an
income
tax
that
a
professional
gambler
would
have
to
respond
to
that
question
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
would
he
have
to
respond
to
that
here
then?
justice
abe
fortas
did
i
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
but
i
thought
you
just
said
that
the
fifth
amendment
--
that
form
1040
may
appropriately
ask
for
the
source
of
income
and
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
no
defense
to
a
person
engaged
in
illegal
gambling
who
fail
to
fill
in
that.
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
know.
i
wouldn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
this
excise
tax
were
set
up
so
that
it
worked
like
a
real
estate
transfer
tax
that
mr.
zeldes
once
described
in
trust.
i
mean,
this
go
to
the
post
office
and
you
buy
an
excess
tax
stamps
and
then
you
keep
them
in
your
possession
so
that
they
can
be
produced
upon
(inaudible).
now,
would
that
--
and
your
opinion
be
upfront
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
number
of
your
difficult
--
the
umber
of
your
contention
here
relates
to
the
disclosures
that
have
to
be
made
to
the
government,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
those
disclosures
are
the
name
of
the
person
stressed
in
the
fact
that
he
is
engaged
in
unlawful
gambling.
is
that
correct
in
this
case
as
distinguished
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
from
marchetti?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
position
is
that
if
those
--
that
if
a
statutory
scheme
were
devised
with
what
--
to
avoid
those
infirmities
that
that
would
not
run
a
file
on
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
fact
that
this
is
--
suppose
the
fact
that
this
is
a
particularized
tax
on
wagers,
the
excise
tax
on
wagers
as
distinguished
from
an
excise
tax
on
driving
an
automobile
or
something
like
that
is
not
really
the
part
of
your
position
here,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
not
of
its
--
levied
as
a
particularized
tax
on
wagering
because
unless
i
--
you
allowed
me
to
mislead
you
which
i've
been
--
i
felt
like
you
did
or
would.
you
have
just
said
that
if
this
same
wagering
tax
were
levied,
assessed
and
administered
on
the
basis
which
did
not
require
disclosure
it
would
not
qualify
under
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
between
the
burglary
case
in
this
case,
you
can
constitutionally
make
a
person
buy
--
pay
an
occupational
tax
could
be
a
gambler,
why
can't
you
make
them
compare
an
occupational
tax
to
be
a
burglar?
he's
got
to
post
a
stamp
saying
i'm
engage
--
in
fact,
i
am
engaged
in
the
business
of
unlawful
gambling
or
are
you
--
why
can't
you
make
him
post
the
tax
because
i'm
engaged
--
the
unlawful
business
of
burglaring
houses?
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
the
theory
the
same.
well,
i'm
not
asking
an
idle
question.
isn't
the
theory,
one
for
theory
be
the
same
in
the
case
of
a
burglars
as
in
the
case
of
a
gambler
in
terms
of
impact
of
the
fifth
amendment.
both
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
cases
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
both
cases
you're
acquiring
incidental
to
a
tax
scheme
a
person
to
disclose
that
he
is
engaged
in
an
unlawful
occupation.
whether
the
unlawful
occupation
of
burglaring
houses
or
a
place
or
--
in
the
business
of
wagering,
i
suggest
that
yourt
comment
may
not
make
any
difference.
