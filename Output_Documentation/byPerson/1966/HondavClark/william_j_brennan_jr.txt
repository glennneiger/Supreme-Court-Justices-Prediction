justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rauh
--
what
could
he
do?
actually
what
could
he
do
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
he
paid.
but
did
they
say
anything
when
they
paid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
why
he
was
paying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
about
that
time,
i'm
talking
about
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
because
we
have
the
case
pending
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
is
mrs.
kendall?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
her
name
on
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
going
to
pay
her?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
posner,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
did
you
say
that
this
letter
at
page
6
was
not
a
representation
that
all
that
a
claimant
could
receive
was
an
amount
computed
at
the
post
war
rate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
--
i'm
looking
at
the
first
paragraph.
does
the
current
rate
of
exchange
of
361.55
yen
to
one
dollar
must
be
used
in
converting
the
yen
into
a
dollar
amount,
i've
read
the
rest
of
the
letter
and
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
even
if
they
would
suggest
that
that
doesn't
mean
exactly
what
it
says?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i'd
been
the
recipient
of
this
letter,
have
been
a
depositor,
are
you
suggesting
that
i
would've
read
that
and
said,
well,
that
really
doesn't
mean
that
i
am
entitled
only
to
--
payment
of
post
war
rate,
and
--
i
can
get
something
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
response
of
this
letter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
does
that
--
are
those
the
1800
claims
the
government
had
been
settled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
tell
us
whether
there's
any
record
of
the
considerations
which
prompted
the
payment
of
90
times
more
than
a
seven-eleven
they
might
get?
of
50
times,
whatever
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
we
--
what
do
we
suppose
we
infer
with
the
department's
holding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
if
i
may
interrupt
then
mr.
posner.
i
take
it
that
--
are
you
suggesting
if
a
--
the
case
had
not
been
--
have
been
mooted
and
we
had
decided
it
against
the
alien
property
custodian's
inclusion
not
only
50
cent.
we
had
said
no
--
the
decision
--
from
the
case
that
resulted
here
and
a
decision
that
know
a
100%
or
something
is
required.
you'd
still
be
taking
the
same
position
i
gather
as
to
these
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you'd
have
said
the
100%
could
only
go
to
those
who
had
actually
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
mr.
posner,
if
all
of
the
claimants
here
or
being
depositors
in
the
specie
bank
instead
of
being
individuals
when
this
happened
had
been
american
municipalities
or
american
states
or
the
united
states
government
itself
and
had
neglected
to
do
the
things
that
you're
talking
about
you'd
say
that
they
will
approve
it
from
any
recovery
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
are
points
available
with
this
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
of
them
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
some
of
the
parties
for
this
litigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
interest
rate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
you're
saying
mr.
rauh,
if
i
have
put
a
$100
in,
what
i
got
was
a
$100
back
$50
on
principle
and
$50
on
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
one
question.
if
in
fact
you
had
taken
or
sought
judicial
review
within
the
60-day
period,
would
not
the
government
have
defended
in
any
event
on
the
ground
that
are
these
folks
had
not
filed
their
certificates
before
the
date
when
the
schedule
came
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
people
who
got
the
abe
rate
the
1800
are
all
people
who
did
two
things.
they
had
filed
their
certificates
before
the
schedule
was
published
and
they
also
sought
judicial
review
after
the
schedule,
did
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
plaintiff
gets
--
what
i'm
wondering
about
is
whether
they
slept
on
the
rights
earlier
suggests
to
the
--
fairly
to
seek
judicial
review,
is
it
really
a
just
to
the
failure
to
file
the
certificate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
would
say
with
the
constitutional
taking
if
--
in
the
situation
i
put
through
mr.
posner,
all
these
depositors
in
the
american
municipalities
or
states
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,

what
