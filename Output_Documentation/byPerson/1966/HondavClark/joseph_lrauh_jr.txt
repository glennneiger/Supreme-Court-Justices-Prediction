mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
are
4100
japanese-american
death
claimants
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
who
held
yen
deposit
certificates
in
the
california
branch
of
the
yokohama
specie
bank
on
the
december
7,
1941.
on
december
7th,
after
the
japanese
attacked,
the
government
seized
and
ultimately
liquidated
all
the
assets
of
that
bank
in
this
country
and
there
is
about
$10
million
there
as
a
result
of
the
seizure
and
liquidation.
during
the
war,
the
class
of
people
who
are
the
claimants
here
were
relocated
out
of
this
western
states
and
that
history
needs
no
repetition
here.
after
the
war,
following
this
court's
decision
in
markham
v.
cabell,
the
statute
was
amended
to
permit
debt
claimants
to
sue
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
against
the
assets
which
have
been
seized
and
liquidated
and
were
there.
two
years
following
1946,
7500
claimants
were
filed
by
the
deposit
holders
in
the
california
branch
of
the
yokohama
specie
bank.
so
by
1948
or
1949,
the
government
was
ready
to
act.
for
the
next
decade,
just
elapsed
while
the
government
was
trying
to
figure
out
whether
what
rate
to
pay.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
they
were
non-negotiable
certificates
of
deposit
redeemable
either
here
or
in
--
either
in
a
california
bank
or
in
japan.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
it
--
that's
one
of
the
arguments
your
honor.
but
i'll
come
--
that's
--
the
government
says,
no.
but
the
government
paid
as
though
the
answer
was
yes;
that's
exactly
the
point.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
you
see,
during
this
ten-year
period,
they
litigated
that
issue.
the
trial
examiner
said,
in
the
justice
department,
this
obligation
was
payable
in
dollars
in
california,
therefore
i
say,
it
should
be
payable
in
the
same
rate
as
before
so
you
get
the
same
dollars
back
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
that
you
put
in.
the
government
overruled
its
own
trial
examiner
and
said,
no,
we'll
pay
you
the
post
war
rate.
we'll
pay
you
only
one-ninetieth,
because
it
came
to
one-ninetieth,
of
the
prewar
rate.
and
the
government
said,
no,
that's
all
we
will
pay
you.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that
they
were
payable
only
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
their
theory
but
i'll
show
you
what
happened.
and
they
didn't
live
up
to
their
theory.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
never
been
litigated
because
after
it
got
to
this
court
in
1963
in
your
court,
your
honors
granted
cert
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
the
government
run
away
and
pay
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
the
other
people.
yes,
your
honor.
well,
then
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
or
for
themselves
or
their
relatives
save,
that
have
been
either
way.
but
there
was
a
history
in
the
trial
examiner
found
that
many
people
have
been
paid
in
dollars
in
this
country.
anyway,
after
the
trial
examiner
held
that
you
got
your
money
back
in
dollars
at
the
prewar
rate
and
that
he
was
overruled
by
justice
and
they
said,
the
post
war
rate,
they
wrote
a
letter
that
everyone
of
these
7500
and
they
said,
your
claim
is
perfectly
good
but
all
you
can
get
is
the
post
war
rate
which
is
one-ninetieth,
and
they
made
this
representation
on
page
6
of
the
record
in
this
letter
they
wrote.
we
must
pay
you
only
one-ninetieth
because
that's
the
rule
of
law
under
deutsche
bank.
we
have
to
just
give
you
one-ninetieth.
so
for
a
man
who
have
a
$100
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
man
who
have
a
$100
that
he
put
in,
the
government
in
that
letter
offered
him
under
the
word
must
that
that's
all
they
were
legally
authorized
to
do
$1.18
plus
interest.
a
total
of
less
than
2%
of
what
he
put
in.
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know
your
honor.
there
are
--
i'm
afraid
that
i
don't
have
that
information
your
honor
would
like
that
i
have
to
obtain
--
i
simply
do
not
know.
i
know
that
these
are
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
they're
typically
--
they're
small
but
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
the
answer
to
your
honors
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
will
submit
it
through
the
clerk.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
will
object
that
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we
don't
even
know
what
the
total
is
because
actually
we
don't
--
we
rep
--
this
is
a
class
suit.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we
do
not
have
the
certificates
or
the
retainers
from
most
of
the
people.
most
these
people
are
unrepresented
except
in
so
far
as
in
a
class
action
we
represent
them.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh!
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
if
there
isn't
we
would
take
what
was
left
but
i
believe
there
is.
i
believe
that
--
the
answer
is,
i
have
to
say
i
believe
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
think
there
is
and
i
think
the
government
does
not
challenge
that.
well,
this
letter
of
1958
is
a
--
well,
if
i
may
use
the
expression
as
a
lulu.
they
say
you
can
have
one-ninetieth
of
what
you
put
in.
but
you
can't
even
have
that
unless
you
file
your
original
deposit
certificate
and
then
they
say,
look,
wouldn't
you
fellows
be
better
off
if
you
went
to
japan
and
took
the
2%
or
less,
it's
slightly
under
2%.
the
government
was
more
anxious
even
though
it
was
a
trustee
of
these
funds
to
get
rid
of
the
claims,
not
to
pay
them.
so
only
1800
out
of
the
7500
send
in
their
money,
their
certificates,
1600
went
to
japan
through
the
withdrawal
route
and
the
4100
that
we
represent
here
this
morning
in
these
class
suit
waived
that
they
did
nothing.
why?
most
of
them
didn't
have
lawyers.
most
of
them
have
language
difficulties.
the
class
of
a
certificate
might
be
as
much
as
one
of
the
small
claims,
17
years
of
delay
and
they
were
discouraged
and
they
finally
decided
to
wait
and
get
whatever
they
could
waiting.
nothing
again
happened
for
three
years.
then
that
final
schedule
comes
up
and
the
final
schedule
doesn't
have
the
4100
on
it
because
they
haven't
sent
in
the
certificate
of
deposit.
the
1800
who
had
sent
in
their
certificates
of
deposit
were
on
the
final
schedule
and
they
brought
suit,
that
was
the
abe
case.
while
the
abe
case
was
pending,
your
honors
granted
certiorari
in
1963
in
the
aratani
case
involving
the
sumitomo
bank
and
the
identical
question,
what
is
the
rate
of
exchange
after
your
honors
granted
cert,
the
government
settled.
and
it
settled
in
abe
for
the
full
face
value
without
interest,
or
you
could
put
it
half
of
the
claim
because
the
interest
was
about
the
same
as
the
principle
here.
they've
had
settled
for
50
times
the
amount
that
we
were
offered,
and
i
would
just
like
to
call
your
honors
attention
to
a
remarkable
statement
in
the
government's
brief,
read
it
on
page
182,
reading
this
at
the
bottom
of
page
22,
reading
as
follows,
the
attorney
general
did
not
repudiate
his
legal
position
thatpayment
at
the
post
war
rate
was
required.
i
most
respectfully
suggest
when
you
pay
50
times
the
post
war
rate,
when
you
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
pre-war
rate
without
interest,
it's
a
little
hard
to
say
that
you're
not
repudiating
your
legal
position
that
you
only
have
to
pay
the
post
war
rate.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
he
paid
50
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
not
--
well,
he
says
he's
paying
because
he
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
don't
know
your
honor.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
i
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
i
--
they
said
that
now
so
i
presume
they
said
that
then,
this
was
a
settlement.
but
it
was
as
said,
there
was
no
few
dollars.
this
was
a
settlement
of
50
times
the
amount
that
we
were
offered
and
i
say
that
was
the
representing
--
actually
now
they're
ready
to
pay
on
the
abe
settlement
of
50
times
that
to
those
that
they
have
some
feeling
for
like
mrs.
kendall
who
after
your
honors
granted
certiorari
in
our
case.
now,
they've
offered
mrs.
kendall
repayment
at
the
abe
rate.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
she
is
the
lady
who
is
also
a
petitioner
here,
who
didn't
get
the
final
schedule
because
of
a
mistake
of
address,
either
on
her
part.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
her
name
was
not
on
the
schedule.
no.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh!
they're
ready
to
pay
her
now
because
it
would
be
so
unjust
not
to
and
i
would
abuse
it
here.
so
now
they
say,
we'll
pay
--,
it's
in
the
brief.
we'll
pay
mrs.
kendall
at
the
abe
rate.
they're
not
treating
the
abe
rate
as
some
strange
thing.
the
abe
rate,
a
settled
rate
--
well
anyway,
we
went
to
them
after
the
settlement
was
made
with
abe
and
said,
you
know,
treat
us
4100
the
same
way
that
you
treated
them.
you're
a
trustee
of
these
funds.
you've
got
the
money.
give
us
the
same
they
could
--
oh,
no!
the
statute
of
limitations
bars
you
because
you
should've
sued
within
60
days
of
the
final
schedule.
we
went
--
oh,
and
the
only
other
thing
they
said
about
this
was,
we're
trying
to
get
out
business
and
it
makes
it
more
difficult
to
do
it
if
we
have
to
go
through
the
4100.
only
giving
us
the
statute
of
limitations,
as
their
reason
why
they
could
do
that.
we
brought
at
this
class
action.
we
lost
at
two
to
one
in
the
court
below.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
government
here
suggested
that
group
that
--
we're
really
--
we're
not
taking
care
of
them
too
and
that's
why
we
shouldn't
get
anything.
but
i've
suggested
there
are
some
rather
crocodile
tears
there
since
they've
never
offered
them
to
us.
furthermore,
if
the
government
wants
to
take
care
of
those
two,
our
class
suit
as
the
government
points
out
contains
two
of
those
people.
and
if
they
want
to
now
settle
with
those
people
too,
why
of
course,
we
will
divide
the
funds
as
we
have
always
felt
the
broadest
possible
distribution
is
right.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
the
two
petitioners
do
--
two
of
our
petitioners
do
have
withdraw
cards
in
so
that
if
the
government
wants
to
settle,
it
will
be
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
it
--
as
the
government
wants
to
settle
with
them
too
we
are
not
arguing
to
them.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we're
arguing
for
the
4100.
we're
arguing
only
for
the
4100.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
it
might
very
well
support
their
--
it
might
very
well
support
them
too
your
honor
because
if
a
representation
was
made
that
all
that
they
could
legally
pay
was
2%
and
they
paid
50
times
that.
and
i
suggest
these
people
relied
on
that
representation.
i
am
not
however
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
representing
them.
now,
there
are
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
because
the
wrong
address
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
got
the
final
schedule
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we
got
the
notices.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
we
claim
that
there
are
four
grounds
of
estoppel
or
tolling.
now
they
overlap
a
little
bit
but
there
are
really
four
separate
in
fair
grounds.
the
first
place
is
the
clearest
estoppel.
they
made
a
representation
of
2%,
we
--
they
said
it
was
a
must
representation,
we
can't
pay
more,
we
relied
on
that.
we
knew
we
can
always
get
the
2%
in
japan.
so
we
didn't
send
in
the
certificates.
they
changed
their
position.
pay
a
100%
without
interest
or
50
times
what
they
give
us.
another
--
no
question
but
for
this
wrongful
representation,
we
would
have
sent
it
in.
the
government's
erroneous
representation
does
the
whole
thing
and
it's
a
clear
case
of
estoppel.
what's
the
government
answer
to
this?
they
say,
you
need
a
misrepresentation
and
you
don't
have
one
here.
they're
wrong
on
both
counts.
under
burnett
and
sterns
of
the
cited
cases
you
don't
need
a
misrepresentation
but
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
because
you
do
have
a
misrepresentation.
the
misrepresentation
was
a
statement
that
they
can
only
pay
2%.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
willful.
the
glus
case
i
respectfully
suggest,
that
the
glus
case
is
not
a
case
of
willful
misrepresentation
because
footnote
2
of
your
honors
opinion
in
glus
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
representations
were
either
willful
or
unintentional.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
it
was
a
representation
that
was
wrong
if
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
it
was
not
a
willful
misrepresentation
your
honor
and
i
simply
suggest
that
you
don't
need
a
willful
misrepresentation.
a
mistake,
a
wrongful
representation
is
sufficient
and
that's
what
we
have.
fifth
--
as
they
said,
we
must
only
pay
a
2%
and
then
they
offer
a
100%
to
the
others.
and
the
--
really
as
trustees,
they
should've
offered
everybody.
that's
really
what
judge
wright
was
saying
in
his
dissent
below.
there
was
not
only
estoppel,
there
was
tolling.
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
for
these
people
to
wait
while
the
abe
suit
went
forward.
the
government
was
on
notice.
it
was
--
it's
just
like
burnett.
the
government
was
on
notice
in
burnett
because
it
was
the
wrong
venue.
the
government
was
on
notice
here
that
these
people
were
making
their
claims
and
i
don't
see
that
the
ones
in
--
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
a
better
case
than
burnett
and
all
--
it
all
--
or
let
me
just
suggest
why
it's
better
than
burnett.
small
claimants
mostly
without
lawyers,
reason
to
expect
that
they
would
get
the
same
treatment
and
finally
and
most
important,
that
government
has
these
funds
which
they
took
from
the
bank,
they're
the
trustee
of
these
funds
for
the
deposit
holders.
that's
--
it's
--
and
i
would
therefore
suggest
that
it's
an
easy
case
after
burnett.
thirdly,
we
should
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
it
--
i
will
get
to
it
before
i'm
through
that
i
don't
think
there's
any
different.
i
don't
think
the
government
ought
to
treat
people
worse
than
the
new
york
central
railroad.
they
do
a
good
job
of
it
themselves.
the
government's
involvement
in
petitioners
delay
adds
to
these
things
and
i
can't
--
in
the
limited
time
available,
do
any
better
than
explaining
exactly
why
they
didn't
--
after
all
these
discouragements,
they
didn't
send
in
there
certificates
in
1958.
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
most
of
the
claimants
failed
to
send
in
their
original
certificates
in
response
to
the
government
in
solving
an
erroneous
suggestion,
17
years
after
it
seizure
their
rights
that
they
could
have
no
more
then
and
should
settle
for
2%.
what
is
surprising
is
that
the
government
which
delayed
20
years
before
it
finally
made
its
indispensable
and
undefended
2%
offer
they
don't
claim
it
was
right.
they
paid
the
--
50
times
that
should
even
ask
this
court
to
bar
petitioner's
admittedly
valid
claims.
now,
that
brings
us
to
the
fourth
point.
everybody
at
bar
here
admits
these
claims
are
valid.
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
this
(inaudible)
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
these
were
not
--
no,
sir.
these
were
not
--
the
claimants
were
not
enemy
alien.
the
assets
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
were
taken
but
the
claimants
--
were
the
claimants
lost
their
lives
in
combat
in
world
war
ii.
they
were
not
--
no
one
was
claiming
that
these
people
were
enemy
aliens.
these
are
the
debt
claimants.
these
are
the
deposit
holders
who
had
asked
--
who
had
rights
against
this.
this
is
the
claimants
themselves
are
all
persons
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
they
couldn't
by
law
at
that
time
be
--
they
all
are
now.
they
are
the
group
and
our
affidavit
show
us
who
became
citizens
as
soon
as
the
law
would
allow
them.
they
were
residents
here
and
became
citizens
since
the
law
would
allow
them
far
from
any
hostility.
these
are
the
people
who
were
wronged
by
our
government.
these
are
the
people
who
fought
for
their
country
despite
all
the
odds
that
they
had,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
they
were
permanent
residents
of
the
united
states
(inaudible)
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
enabled
by
law
to
become
citizens,
who
became
citizens
as
soon
as
the
law
would
allow
it.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
in
a
--
if
--
and
so
were
the
--
in
the
sense
--
in
the
technical
sense
that
the
boys
who
fought
in
comrade
team
442.
oh
yes,
your
honor.
the
claims
are
admittedly
valid
--
no,
the
government
is
not
arguing
against
the
validity.
what
they
are
saying
is
that
some
time
despite
all
their
action,
despite
all
the
efforts
of
the
--
that
were
made
in
the
time,
despite
their
delay,
they
can
rely
upon
the
defense
of
a
statute
of
limitations
even
though
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitation
is
that
there's
a
stale
claim.
there's
no
stale
claim
here.
there's
no
problem
of
defense
against
the
stale
claim.
the
claim
is
admittedly
valid
so,
you
have
all
four
of
these
reasons
as
a
clear
estoppel
on
a
representation,
as
a
clear
tolling
while
waiting
for
this,
the
government
is
involved
in
this
as
the
claims
that
are
admittedly
valid.
and
i
just
say
there's
an
overwhelming
case
of
estoppel
and
tolling.
what's
the
government's
answer
to
this?
well,
that
was
the
point.
the
government
says
as
your
honors
said,
we're
not
like
the
new
york
central
railroad.
the
government's
answer
is,
because
of
sovereign
immunity,
we
don't
have
to
do
anything
like
anybody
else
does.
tolling
and
estoppel
don't
apply
to
us
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
well,
this
is
wrong
for
three
reasons.
first,
there
was
a
taking.
a
--
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
would
ever
hold
that
equivocal
that
when
you
take
a
creditor's
--
where
you
take
his
debtor's
assets
away,
you're
not
doing
anything
to
him.
when
they
took
the
assets
of
the
bank
away,
they
took
away
the
chance
of
collecting
the
--
on
these
deposits.
but
then
congress
said,
we'll
pay
you.
and
congress
did
not
do
this
out
of
some
kind
of
a
feeling
--
of
just
benevolence.
congress
themselves
said,
this
is
the
house
report.
but
for
the
vesting
of
their
debtors'
property,
they
would
presumably
have
been
able
to
pursue
ordinary
remedies
against
the
debtors
and
they
gave
the
debtors
these
opportunities
and
there
is
not
one
word,
and
i
make
this
is
very,
very
significant,
there's
not
one
word
suggesing
that
they
were
giving
up
their
sovereign
immunity.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
they
didn't
give
up
their
sovereign
immunity
because
they
didn't
have
it
to
start
with.
this
was
sovereign
liability
because
this
was
property
taken.
this
was
property
taken
from
residents
here
who
had
--
who
at
that
time
were
not
able
to
be
citizens
as
your
honors
suggest.
finally,
i
do
not
suggest
that
once
a
waiver
--
i
do
not
suggest
that
there's
one
way
or
another
on
the
final
question
which
is
involved
in
yesterday's
case,
the
crown
coat
case
which
finished
this
morning.
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
you
don't
have
the
--
why
--
there
should
be
a
rule
even
in
general
principles
that
there
isn't
a
tolling
against
the
government.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
government
should
suddenly
get
out
of
tolling
just
because
it
is
the
government
estoppel
and
tolling
once
congress
waives
immunity,
there's
no
evidence
it
wants
to
waive
a
little
bit
and
not
give
them
the
full
benefit
of
the
tolling
and
the
estoppel.
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
and
simply
suggest
that
we
have
here
made
an
overwhelming
case
on
the
equitable
and
estoppel
and
tolling.
the
only
question
that
arises
whether
the
government
gets
special
treatment
of
getting
out
of
that
and
i
see
no
reason
where
a
constitutional
issue
arises
or
where
congress
makes
no
slightest
indication
that
it
wants
to
bar
tolling
and
indeed
itself
indicates
that
we
want
to
do
the
fair
thing
and
allows
tolling
in
two
instances
as
they're
set
forth
on
page
24
of
our
brief.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
the
money
goes
into
the
war
claims
fund.
it
would
be
no
difference,
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
money
went
into
the
general
revenues.
the
money
goes
to
someone
else
instead
of
the
people
who
have
the
deposits
in
the
bank
and
who
congress
said
should
get
it.
congress
in
46
said,
the
deposits
in
the
bank
should
go
--
the
assets
of
the
bank
liquidated
should
go
to
the
debt
claimants
on
the
bank.
it
is
true
that
if
we
don't
get
it,
it
goes
into
the
war
claims
fund.
it
may
very
well
go
to
some
big
--
a
concern
with
a
claim
against
germany
or
japan
overseas.
but
if
it
wasn't
congress'
intention
that
this
be
done
and
indeed
the
government
never
made
this
point
until
in
its
briefed
now.
when
we
went
to
the
government
and
said,
you're
a
trustee
of
these
funds.
give
us
the
same
treatment
that
you
gave
the
abe
holders.
the
two
answers
were
statute
of
limitations
and
administrative
convenience.
they
never
suggested
at
that
time
in
any
way
should
it
reform
that
the
money
might
go
somewhere
else.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
just
like
to
clear
up
one
facts
of
question.
your
honors
heard
the
government
concede
that
most
of
people
didn't
have
lawyers
but
the
government
counsel
suggested
that
all
the
name
plaintiffs
did
have
lawyers.
that's
absolutely
untrue
and
i
would
like
to
--
your
honors
please
to
do
me
the
courtesy
of
looking
at
the
page
16
of
the
green
brief.
on
page
16
of
the
green
brief,
you
will
see
that
four
names
were
added
as
names
--
it's
the
reply
brief
that
four
names
were
added
as
a
plaintiff
--
named
plaintiffs
on
page
16
of
the
green
brief
and
that
the
government
concedes
that
the
last
three
did
not
have
counsel
at
any
time.
in
other
words
that
--
not
only
didn't
the
bulk
of
these
people
have
counsel
but
the
named
plaintiffs
didn't
have
counsel
so
much
for
the
questions
of
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
some
of
them
did.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
they
did
and
my
point
about
that
would
be
that
the
counsel
as
well
as
the
man
reasonably
thought
that
the
--
there
was
only
one
issue
here.
what
would
the
rate
of
pay
be?
this
was
--
i
can
say
there's
--
with
a
smile
on
my
face
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
that
time.
but
counsel
of
--
the
counsels
were
in
the
case
reasonably
thought
that
since
there's
only
one
issue.
the
issue
of
the
rate
when
that
issue
was
settled
its
going
to
apply
to
everybody.
now
i'm
afraid
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
didn't
satisfy
your
question
about
whether
these
people,
these
resident
aliens,
these
japanese-americans
were
protected
by
the
constitution.
i
believe
they
are
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
to
due
process.
i
believe
that
those
who
were
not
paroled
or
interned
are
treated
both
by
the
constitution
and
by
the
statute
as
to
save
our
citizens
and
that
their
rights
are
protected
there,
and
that
this
was
--
which
was
a
clear
taking
of
the
assets
underlying
their
debts
which
is
really
had
cost
the
--
the
lost
of
funds,
caused
the
devaluation
clearly
raises
a
constitutional
provi
--
and
that
constitutional
point
which
is
only
satisfied
by
a
provision
for
fair
return
at
the
society
international
ray
rogers
that
there
must
be
a
fair
procedure
for
return,
i
say
what
happened
here
was
not
a
fair
procedure.
mr.
justice
white,
you
used
the
word
late
filers.
i
just
like
to
point
out,
we
were
on
time
filing.
we
filed
in
time.
we
were
treated
as
such.
we
simply
didn't
bring
the
suit
at
that
time
because
we
thought
we
would
get
the
same
protection
that
the
others
got
because
it
was
only
one
issue.
as
far
as
the
war
claims
issue
is
concern
mr.
chief
justice
that
was
never
raised
until
in
this
court.
the
war
claims
issue
is
an
afterthought,
when
we
asked
to
be
treated
the
same,
they
said,
no.
the
statute
of
limitations
bars
you
and
we're
not
going
to
go
through
this.
we
want
to
wind
up.
the
war
claims
is
an
afterthought
brought
in
here
that
is
irrelevant
because
the
real
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
treat,
give
the
assets.
these
aren't
assets
that
alarm
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh,
we
get
that
in
japan.
yes,
your
honor.
i've
never
said
we
could
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no.
we
had
to
send
in
the
certificates
to
deposit
your
honor,
we
didn't
send
those
in.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
the
claim,
there
was
a
timely
filing,
the
claim
was
dismissed
your
honor
when
we
didn't
get
send
in
the
certificates
of
deposit.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
think
it
just
--
it
is
the
only
thing
the
government
relies
on
is
the
fact
we
didn't
bring
the
court
action
because
we
could
have
lost
the
court
action
when
they
issued
the
schedule
in
61
without
us
on
it.
we
could
have
brought
the
court
action
at
that
time.
we
didn't
--
we're
--
but
just
remember
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
because
we
did
not
bring
suit
within
60
days
after
the
schedule
was
filed
in
61
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
have
the
second
your
honor.
i
think
the
government
has
made
clear
its
stands
ready
to
pay
anybody
who
is
not
barred
or
who
if
it's
told.
they're
ready
to
pay
him.
well,
you
see
they're
not
only
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
at
the
abe
rate.
which
is
not
the
total
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no.
and
we're
only
doing
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh,
yes.
i
made
myself
clear,
we're
only
suing
for
the
abe
settlement.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
precisely.
we
are
not
making
an
issue
of
that.
if
this
court
holds
as
i
have
urged
it
to
hold
that
the
government
is
estopped
or
their
limitations
is
tolled,
i
understand
the
government
because
they've
never
argued
anything.
they
would
pay
us
at
the
abe
rate.
they
are
already
preparing
to
pay
mrs.
kando,
one
of
the
named
petitioners
who
didn't
get
the
schedule
at
the
abe
rate.
the
abe
rate
is
now
(voice

--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
guess
it
--
i
wouldn't
indicate
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
your
honors,
50%
of
the
pre
--
of
what
--
no,
it's
a
100%
of
the
prewar
rate
your
honor.
they
--
its
50%
of
prewar
plus
interest.
they
paid
the
abe
people
what
they
thought
--
what
they
put
in
in
dollars?
they
didn't
get
--
what
they
lost
was
their
interest
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
presume
it
would
be
6%
your
honor
and
that
came
to
about
the
same
as
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
or
a
$100
on
principle
and
no
interest
which
ever
(voice

--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
they
might
have
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
they
would've
had
defense.
they
would've
argued.
and
again,
i
--
while
you've
been
here
if
i
have
been
retained,
i
would've
been
here
arguing
that
that
was
estopped
and
tolled
the
same
way.
but
they
would've
--
they
couldn't
had
a
defense
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
your
honor
must
remember
that
only
1800
out
of
7500
did
that
though.
you
can
say
what
you
want
about
this
letter
not
being
insolvent.
but
only
1800
did
send
it
in
and
the
4100
here
who
didn't
send
it
in,
who
mr.
posner
suggests
that
slept
on
their
rights
and
i
just
conclude
if
i
may
with
the
suggestion
that
when
it
is
suggested
that
someone
slept
on
their
rights
for
waiting
two
and
a
half
years
to
bring
a
suit
when
the
government
waited
over
20
years
to
make
any
(voice

--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
the
government
here
is
--
were
addressing
it
to
the
failure
to
bring
the
suit.
that
they
argued
to
us
in
--
before
but
in
their
brief
here
they
addressed
it
solely,
there's
a
sentence
i've
seen
in
the
brief.
it
says,
this
is
done
solely
because
of
the
statute
of
limitation
which
we
say
is
tolled
and
estopped
for
the
four
reasons
which
i
gave.
and
if
the
government
to,
especially
on
the
constitutional
taking
situation
and
we
do
urge
that
these
people
who
have
suffered
so
much
and
(voice

--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh,
i
think
they
are
in
the
same
plates
except
we
got
a
better
equity
in
the
sense
that
they're
small
people
whose
--
the
savings

and
who
had
suffered
so
much
at
the
hands
of
the
government.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
at
page
5
of
our
complaint
--
at
the
page
of
the
record
of
our
complaint,
we
asked
if
they
be
paid
in
the
same
conversion
ratio
as
the
plaintiffs
in
(inaudible)
v.
kennedy.
we
did
that
because
of
this
reason,
we
felt
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we
--
i
can't
--
we
have
a
class
suit
in
which
the
-
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
in
japan?
no,
your
honor.
there
are
1600
people
there
and
i
suggested
earlier
that
the
government
had
mention
them
and
said,
isn't
too
bad
about
them
and
why
should
we
paid
because
of
them.
and
my
suggestion
was
the
two
of
our
--we
are
not,
as
i've
explained
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
are
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
making
that
point
but
we
are
saying
that
the
government
really
now
want
to
settle
this
after
your
honors
rule
if
it
should
be
favorable
to
us.
we
do
have
two
of
our
plaintiffs
who
are
in
that
category
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
cannot
say
on
a
class
suit
what
would
happen.
you
always
has
--
your
honor
knows
and
as
it
imply,
you
always
have
to
give
notice.
if
we
were
to
win
we
go
back
to
the
district
court.
they'd
have
to
give
notice
to
everyone
and
if
someone
were
going
to
complain,
i'm
not
going
to
say
they
would.
i
am
of
course
bound
to
argue
that
for
the
complaint
namely
that
the
--
all
we
are
entitled
to
is
the
abe
settlement.
that's
all
we
sued
for.
we
sued
for
that
because
we
felt
the
government
was
a
trustee
of
funds
they
had
seized
which
funds
would
have
paid
our
deposit
holders
and
which
therefore
they
should
now
pay
to
us.
we
therefore
sued
for
the
exact
amount
because
we
felt
they
were
the
trustee
for
all
the
claimants.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
are
4100
japanese-american
death
claimants
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
who
held
yen
deposit
certificates
in
the
california
branch
of
the
yokohama
specie
bank
on
the
december
7,
1941.
on
december
7th,
after
the
japanese
attacked,
the
government
seized
and
ultimately
liquidated
all
the
assets
of
that
bank
in
this
country
and
there
is
about
$10
million
there
as
a
result
of
the
seizure
and
liquidation.
during
the
war,
the
class
of
people
who
are
the
claimants
here
were
relocated
out
of
this
western
states
and
that
history
needs
no
repetition
here.
after
the
war,
following
this
court's
decision
in
markham
v.
cabell,
the
statute
was
amended
to
permit
debt
claimants
to
sue
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
against
the
assets
which
have
been
seized
and
liquidated
and
were
there.
two
years
following
1946,
7500
claimants
were
filed
by
the
deposit
holders
in
the
california
branch
of
the
yokohama
specie
bank.
so
by
1948
or
1949,
the
government
was
ready
to
act.
for
the
next
decade,
just
elapsed
while
the
government
was
trying
to
figure
out
whether
what
rate
to
pay.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
they
were
non-negotiable
certificates
of
deposit
redeemable
either
here
or
in
--
either
in
a
california
bank
or
in
japan.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
it
--
that's
one
of
the
arguments
your
honor.
but
i'll
come
--
that's
--
the
government
says,
no.
but
the
government
paid
as
though
the
answer
was
yes;
that's
exactly
the
point.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
you
see,
during
this
ten-year
period,
they
litigated
that
issue.
the
trial
examiner
said,
in
the
justice
department,
this
obligation
was
payable
in
dollars
in
california,
therefore
i
say,
it
should
be
payable
in
the
same
rate
as
before
so
you
get
the
same
dollars
back
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
that
you
put
in.
the
government
overruled
its
own
trial
examiner
and
said,
no,
we'll
pay
you
the
post
war
rate.
we'll
pay
you
only
one-ninetieth,
because
it
came
to
one-ninetieth,
of
the
prewar
rate.
and
the
government
said,
no,
that's
all
we
will
pay
you.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that
they
were
payable
only
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
their
theory
but
i'll
show
you
what
happened.
and
they
didn't
live
up
to
their
theory.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
never
been
litigated
because
after
it
got
to
this
court
in
1963
in
your
court,
your
honors
granted
cert
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
the
government
run
away
and
pay
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
the
other
people.
yes,
your
honor.
well,
then
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
or
for
themselves
or
their
relatives
save,
that
have
been
either
way.
but
there
was
a
history
in
the
trial
examiner
found
that
many
people
have
been
paid
in
dollars
in
this
country.
anyway,
after
the
trial
examiner
held
that
you
got
your
money
back
in
dollars
at
the
prewar
rate
and
that
he
was
overruled
by
justice
and
they
said,
the
post
war
rate,
they
wrote
a
letter
that
everyone
of
these
7500
and
they
said,
your
claim
is
perfectly
good
but
all
you
can
get
is
the
post
war
rate
which
is
one-ninetieth,
and
they
made
this
representation
on
page
6
of
the
record
in
this
letter
they
wrote.
we
must
pay
you
only
one-ninetieth
because
that's
the
rule
of
law
under
deutsche
bank.
we
have
to
just
give
you
one-ninetieth.
so
for
a
man
who
have
a
$100
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
man
who
have
a
$100
that
he
put
in,
the
government
in
that
letter
offered
him
under
the
word
must
that
that's
all
they
were
legally
authorized
to
do
$1.18
plus
interest.
a
total
of
less
than
2%
of
what
he
put
in.
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know
your
honor.
there
are
--
i'm
afraid
that
i
don't
have
that
information
your
honor
would
like
that
i
have
to
obtain
--
i
simply
do
not
know.
i
know
that
these
are
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
they're
typically
--
they're
small
but
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
the
answer
to
your
honors
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
will
submit
it
through
the
clerk.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
will
object
that
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we
don't
even
know
what
the
total
is
because
actually
we
don't
--
we
rep
--
this
is
a
class
suit.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we
do
not
have
the
certificates
or
the
retainers
from
most
of
the
people.
most
these
people
are
unrepresented
except
in
so
far
as
in
a
class
action
we
represent
them.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh!
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
if
there
isn't
we
would
take
what
was
left
but
i
believe
there
is.
i
believe
that
--
the
answer
is,
i
have
to
say
i
believe
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
think
there
is
and
i
think
the
government
does
not
challenge
that.
well,
this
letter
of
1958
is
a
--
well,
if
i
may
use
the
expression
as
a
lulu.
they
say
you
can
have
one-ninetieth
of
what
you
put
in.
but
you
can't
even
have
that
unless
you
file
your
original
deposit
certificate
and
then
they
say,
look,
wouldn't
you
fellows
be
better
off
if
you
went
to
japan
and
took
the
2%
or
less,
it's
slightly
under
2%.
the
government
was
more
anxious
even
though
it
was
a
trustee
of
these
funds
to
get
rid
of
the
claims,
not
to
pay
them.
so
only
1800
out
of
the
7500
send
in
their
money,
their
certificates,
1600
went
to
japan
through
the
withdrawal
route
and
the
4100
that
we
represent
here
this
morning
in
these
class
suit
waived
that
they
did
nothing.
why?
most
of
them
didn't
have
lawyers.
most
of
them
have
language
difficulties.
the
class
of
a
certificate
might
be
as
much
as
one
of
the
small
claims,
17
years
of
delay
and
they
were
discouraged
and
they
finally
decided
to
wait
and
get
whatever
they
could
waiting.
nothing
again
happened
for
three
years.
then
that
final
schedule
comes
up
and
the
final
schedule
doesn't
have
the
4100
on
it
because
they
haven't
sent
in
the
certificate
of
deposit.
the
1800
who
had
sent
in
their
certificates
of
deposit
were
on
the
final
schedule
and
they
brought
suit,
that
was
the
abe
case.
while
the
abe
case
was
pending,
your
honors
granted
certiorari
in
1963
in
the
aratani
case
involving
the
sumitomo
bank
and
the
identical
question,
what
is
the
rate
of
exchange
after
your
honors
granted
cert,
the
government
settled.
and
it
settled
in
abe
for
the
full
face
value
without
interest,
or
you
could
put
it
half
of
the
claim
because
the
interest
was
about
the
same
as
the
principle
here.
they've
had
settled
for
50
times
the
amount
that
we
were
offered,
and
i
would
just
like
to
call
your
honors
attention
to
a
remarkable
statement
in
the
government's
brief,
read
it
on
page
182,
reading
this
at
the
bottom
of
page
22,
reading
as
follows,
the
attorney
general
did
not
repudiate
his
legal
position
thatpayment
at
the
post
war
rate
was
required.
i
most
respectfully
suggest
when
you
pay
50
times
the
post
war
rate,
when
you
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
pre-war
rate
without
interest,
it's
a
little
hard
to
say
that
you're
not
repudiating
your
legal
position
that
you
only
have
to
pay
the
post
war
rate.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
he
paid
50
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
not
--
well,
he
says
he's
paying
because
he
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
don't
know
your
honor.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
i
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
i
--
they
said
that
now
so
i
presume
they
said
that
then,
this
was
a
settlement.
but
it
was
as
said,
there
was
no
few
dollars.
this
was
a
settlement
of
50
times
the
amount
that
we
were
offered
and
i
say
that
was
the
representing
--
actually
now
they're
ready
to
pay
on
the
abe
settlement
of
50
times
that
to
those
that
they
have
some
feeling
for
like
mrs.
kendall
who
after
your
honors
granted
certiorari
in
our
case.
now,
they've
offered
mrs.
kendall
repayment
at
the
abe
rate.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
she
is
the
lady
who
is
also
a
petitioner
here,
who
didn't
get
the
final
schedule
because
of
a
mistake
of
address,
either
on
her
part.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
her
name
was
not
on
the
schedule.
no.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh!
they're
ready
to
pay
her
now
because
it
would
be
so
unjust
not
to
and
i
would
abuse
it
here.
so
now
they
say,
we'll
pay
--,
it's
in
the
brief.
we'll
pay
mrs.
kendall
at
the
abe
rate.
they're
not
treating
the
abe
rate
as
some
strange
thing.
the
abe
rate,
a
settled
rate
--
well
anyway,
we
went
to
them
after
the
settlement
was
made
with
abe
and
said,
you
know,
treat
us
4100
the
same
way
that
you
treated
them.
you're
a
trustee
of
these
funds.
you've
got
the
money.
give
us
the
same
they
could
--
oh,
no!
the
statute
of
limitations
bars
you
because
you
should've
sued
within
60
days
of
the
final
schedule.
we
went
--
oh,
and
the
only
other
thing
they
said
about
this
was,
we're
trying
to
get
out
business
and
it
makes
it
more
difficult
to
do
it
if
we
have
to
go
through
the
4100.
only
giving
us
the
statute
of
limitations,
as
their
reason
why
they
could
do
that.
we
brought
at
this
class
action.
we
lost
at
two
to
one
in
the
court
below.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
government
here
suggested
that
group
that
--
we're
really
--
we're
not
taking
care
of
them
too
and
that's
why
we
shouldn't
get
anything.
but
i've
suggested
there
are
some
rather
crocodile
tears
there
since
they've
never
offered
them
to
us.
furthermore,
if
the
government
wants
to
take
care
of
those
two,
our
class
suit
as
the
government
points
out
contains
two
of
those
people.
and
if
they
want
to
now
settle
with
those
people
too,
why
of
course,
we
will
divide
the
funds
as
we
have
always
felt
the
broadest
possible
distribution
is
right.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
the
two
petitioners
do
--
two
of
our
petitioners
do
have
withdraw
cards
in
so
that
if
the
government
wants
to
settle,
it
will
be
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
it
--
as
the
government
wants
to
settle
with
them
too
we
are
not
arguing
to
them.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we're
arguing
for
the
4100.
we're
arguing
only
for
the
4100.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
it
might
very
well
support
their
--
it
might
very
well
support
them
too
your
honor
because
if
a
representation
was
made
that
all
that
they
could
legally
pay
was
2%
and
they
paid
50
times
that.
and
i
suggest
these
people
relied
on
that
representation.
i
am
not
however
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
representing
them.
now,
there
are
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
because
the
wrong
address
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
got
the
final
schedule
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we
got
the
notices.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
we
claim
that
there
are
four
grounds
of
estoppel
or
tolling.
now
they
overlap
a
little
bit
but
there
are
really
four
separate
in
fair
grounds.
the
first
place
is
the
clearest
estoppel.
they
made
a
representation
of
2%,
we
--
they
said
it
was
a
must
representation,
we
can't
pay
more,
we
relied
on
that.
we
knew
we
can
always
get
the
2%
in
japan.
so
we
didn't
send
in
the
certificates.
they
changed
their
position.
pay
a
100%
without
interest
or
50
times
what
they
give
us.
another
--
no
question
but
for
this
wrongful
representation,
we
would
have
sent
it
in.
the
government's
erroneous
representation
does
the
whole
thing
and
it's
a
clear
case
of
estoppel.
what's
the
government
answer
to
this?
they
say,
you
need
a
misrepresentation
and
you
don't
have
one
here.
they're
wrong
on
both
counts.
under
burnett
and
sterns
of
the
cited
cases
you
don't
need
a
misrepresentation
but
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
because
you
do
have
a
misrepresentation.
the
misrepresentation
was
a
statement
that
they
can
only
pay
2%.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
willful.
the
glus
case
i
respectfully
suggest,
that
the
glus
case
is
not
a
case
of
willful
misrepresentation
because
footnote
2
of
your
honors
opinion
in
glus
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
representations
were
either
willful
or
unintentional.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
it
was
a
representation
that
was
wrong
if
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
it
was
not
a
willful
misrepresentation
your
honor
and
i
simply
suggest
that
you
don't
need
a
willful
misrepresentation.
a
mistake,
a
wrongful
representation
is
sufficient
and
that's
what
we
have.
fifth
--
as
they
said,
we
must
only
pay
a
2%
and
then
they
offer
a
100%
to
the
others.
and
the
--
really
as
trustees,
they
should've
offered
everybody.
that's
really
what
judge
wright
was
saying
in
his
dissent
below.
there
was
not
only
estoppel,
there
was
tolling.
it
was
perfectly
reasonable
for
these
people
to
wait
while
the
abe
suit
went
forward.
the
government
was
on
notice.
it
was
--
it's
just
like
burnett.
the
government
was
on
notice
in
burnett
because
it
was
the
wrong
venue.
the
government
was
on
notice
here
that
these
people
were
making
their
claims
and
i
don't
see
that
the
ones
in
--
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
a
better
case
than
burnett
and
all
--
it
all
--
or
let
me
just
suggest
why
it's
better
than
burnett.
small
claimants
mostly
without
lawyers,
reason
to
expect
that
they
would
get
the
same
treatment
and
finally
and
most
important,
that
government
has
these
funds
which
they
took
from
the
bank,
they're
the
trustee
of
these
funds
for
the
deposit
holders.
that's
--
it's
--
and
i
would
therefore
suggest
that
it's
an
easy
case
after
burnett.
thirdly,
we
should
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
it
--
i
will
get
to
it
before
i'm
through
that
i
don't
think
there's
any
different.
i
don't
think
the
government
ought
to
treat
people
worse
than
the
new
york
central
railroad.
they
do
a
good
job
of
it
themselves.
the
government's
involvement
in
petitioners
delay
adds
to
these
things
and
i
can't
--
in
the
limited
time
available,
do
any
better
than
explaining
exactly
why
they
didn't
--
after
all
these
discouragements,
they
didn't
send
in
there
certificates
in
1958.
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
most
of
the
claimants
failed
to
send
in
their
original
certificates
in
response
to
the
government
in
solving
an
erroneous
suggestion,
17
years
after
it
seizure
their
rights
that
they
could
have
no
more
then
and
should
settle
for
2%.
what
is
surprising
is
that
the
government
which
delayed
20
years
before
it
finally
made
its
indispensable
and
undefended
2%
offer
they
don't
claim
it
was
right.
they
paid
the
--
50
times
that
should
even
ask
this
court
to
bar
petitioner's
admittedly
valid
claims.
now,
that
brings
us
to
the
fourth
point.
everybody
at
bar
here
admits
these
claims
are
valid.
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
this
(inaudible)
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
these
were
not
--
no,
sir.
these
were
not
--
the
claimants
were
not
enemy
alien.
the
assets
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
were
taken
but
the
claimants
--
were
the
claimants
lost
their
lives
in
combat
in
world
war
ii.
they
were
not
--
no
one
was
claiming
that
these
people
were
enemy
aliens.
these
are
the
debt
claimants.
these
are
the
deposit
holders
who
had
asked
--
who
had
rights
against
this.
this
is
the
claimants
themselves
are
all
persons
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
they
couldn't
by
law
at
that
time
be
--
they
all
are
now.
they
are
the
group
and
our
affidavit
show
us
who
became
citizens
as
soon
as
the
law
would
allow
them.
they
were
residents
here
and
became
citizens
since
the
law
would
allow
them
far
from
any
hostility.
these
are
the
people
who
were
wronged
by
our
government.
these
are
the
people
who
fought
for
their
country
despite
all
the
odds
that
they
had,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
they
were
permanent
residents
of
the
united
states
(inaudible)
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
enabled
by
law
to
become
citizens,
who
became
citizens
as
soon
as
the
law
would
allow
it.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
in
a
--
if
--
and
so
were
the
--
in
the
sense
--
in
the
technical
sense
that
the
boys
who
fought
in
comrade
team
442.
oh
yes,
your
honor.
the
claims
are
admittedly
valid
--
no,
the
government
is
not
arguing
against
the
validity.
what
they
are
saying
is
that
some
time
despite
all
their
action,
despite
all
the
efforts
of
the
--
that
were
made
in
the
time,
despite
their
delay,
they
can
rely
upon
the
defense
of
a
statute
of
limitations
even
though
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitation
is
that
there's
a
stale
claim.
there's
no
stale
claim
here.
there's
no
problem
of
defense
against
the
stale
claim.
the
claim
is
admittedly
valid
so,
you
have
all
four
of
these
reasons
as
a
clear
estoppel
on
a
representation,
as
a
clear
tolling
while
waiting
for
this,
the
government
is
involved
in
this
as
the
claims
that
are
admittedly
valid.
and
i
just
say
there's
an
overwhelming
case
of
estoppel
and
tolling.
what's
the
government's
answer
to
this?
well,
that
was
the
point.
the
government
says
as
your
honors
said,
we're
not
like
the
new
york
central
railroad.
the
government's
answer
is,
because
of
sovereign
immunity,
we
don't
have
to
do
anything
like
anybody
else
does.
tolling
and
estoppel
don't
apply
to
us
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
well,
this
is
wrong
for
three
reasons.
first,
there
was
a
taking.
a
--
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
would
ever
hold
that
equivocal
that
when
you
take
a
creditor's
--
where
you
take
his
debtor's
assets
away,
you're
not
doing
anything
to
him.
when
they
took
the
assets
of
the
bank
away,
they
took
away
the
chance
of
collecting
the
--
on
these
deposits.
but
then
congress
said,
we'll
pay
you.
and
congress
did
not
do
this
out
of
some
kind
of
a
feeling
--
of
just
benevolence.
congress
themselves
said,
this
is
the
house
report.
but
for
the
vesting
of
their
debtors'
property,
they
would
presumably
have
been
able
to
pursue
ordinary
remedies
against
the
debtors
and
they
gave
the
debtors
these
opportunities
and
there
is
not
one
word,
and
i
make
this
is
very,
very
significant,
there's
not
one
word
suggesing
that
they
were
giving
up
their
sovereign
immunity.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
they
didn't
give
up
their
sovereign
immunity
because
they
didn't
have
it
to
start
with.
this
was
sovereign
liability
because
this
was
property
taken.
this
was
property
taken
from
residents
here
who
had
--
who
at
that
time
were
not
able
to
be
citizens
as
your
honors
suggest.
finally,
i
do
not
suggest
that
once
a
waiver
--
i
do
not
suggest
that
there's
one
way
or
another
on
the
final
question
which
is
involved
in
yesterday's
case,
the
crown
coat
case
which
finished
this
morning.
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
you
don't
have
the
--
why
--
there
should
be
a
rule
even
in
general
principles
that
there
isn't
a
tolling
against
the
government.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
government
should
suddenly
get
out
of
tolling
just
because
it
is
the
government
estoppel
and
tolling
once
congress
waives
immunity,
there's
no
evidence
it
wants
to
waive
a
little
bit
and
not
give
them
the
full
benefit
of
the
tolling
and
the
estoppel.
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
and
simply
suggest
that
we
have
here
made
an
overwhelming
case
on
the
equitable
and
estoppel
and
tolling.
the
only
question
that
arises
whether
the
government
gets
special
treatment
of
getting
out
of
that
and
i
see
no
reason
where
a
constitutional
issue
arises
or
where
congress
makes
no
slightest
indication
that
it
wants
to
bar
tolling
and
indeed
itself
indicates
that
we
want
to
do
the
fair
thing
and
allows
tolling
in
two
instances
as
they're
set
forth
on
page
24
of
our
brief.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
the
money
goes
into
the
war
claims
fund.
it
would
be
no
difference,
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
money
went
into
the
general
revenues.
the
money
goes
to
someone
else
instead
of
the
people
who
have
the
deposits
in
the
bank
and
who
congress
said
should
get
it.
congress
in
46
said,
the
deposits
in
the
bank
should
go
--
the
assets
of
the
bank
liquidated
should
go
to
the
debt
claimants
on
the
bank.
it
is
true
that
if
we
don't
get
it,
it
goes
into
the
war
claims
fund.
it
may
very
well
go
to
some
big
--
a
concern
with
a
claim
against
germany
or
japan
overseas.
but
if
it
wasn't
congress'
intention
that
this
be
done
and
indeed
the
government
never
made
this
point
until
in
its
briefed
now.
when
we
went
to
the
government
and
said,
you're
a
trustee
of
these
funds.
give
us
the
same
treatment
that
you
gave
the
abe
holders.
the
two
answers
were
statute
of
limitations
and
administrative
convenience.
they
never
suggested
at
that
time
in
any
way
should
it
reform
that
the
money
might
go
somewhere
else.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
just
like
to
clear
up
one
facts
of
question.
your
honors
heard
the
government
concede
that
most
of
people
didn't
have
lawyers
but
the
government
counsel
suggested
that
all
the
name
plaintiffs
did
have
lawyers.
that's
absolutely
untrue
and
i
would
like
to
--
your
honors
please
to
do
me
the
courtesy
of
looking
at
the
page
16
of
the
green
brief.
on
page
16
of
the
green
brief,
you
will
see
that
four
names
were
added
as
names
--
it's
the
reply
brief
that
four
names
were
added
as
a
plaintiff
--
named
plaintiffs
on
page
16
of
the
green
brief
and
that
the
government
concedes
that
the
last
three
did
not
have
counsel
at
any
time.
in
other
words
that
--
not
only
didn't
the
bulk
of
these
people
have
counsel
but
the
named
plaintiffs
didn't
have
counsel
so
much
for
the
questions
of
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
some
of
them
did.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
they
did
and
my
point
about
that
would
be
that
the
counsel
as
well
as
the
man
reasonably
thought
that
the
--
there
was
only
one
issue
here.
what
would
the
rate
of
pay
be?
this
was
--
i
can
say
there's
--
with
a
smile
on
my
face
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
that
time.
but
counsel
of
--
the
counsels
were
in
the
case
reasonably
thought
that
since
there's
only
one
issue.
the
issue
of
the
rate
when
that
issue
was
settled
its
going
to
apply
to
everybody.
now
i'm
afraid
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
didn't
satisfy
your
question
about
whether
these
people,
these
resident
aliens,
these
japanese-americans
were
protected
by
the
constitution.
i
believe
they
are
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
to
due
process.
i
believe
that
those
who
were
not
paroled
or
interned
are
treated
both
by
the
constitution
and
by
the
statute
as
to
save
our
citizens
and
that
their
rights
are
protected
there,
and
that
this
was
--
which
was
a
clear
taking
of
the
assets
underlying
their
debts
which
is
really
had
cost
the
--
the
lost
of
funds,
caused
the
devaluation
clearly
raises
a
constitutional
provi
--
and
that
constitutional
point
which
is
only
satisfied
by
a
provision
for
fair
return
at
the
society
international
ray
rogers
that
there
must
be
a
fair
procedure
for
return,
i
say
what
happened
here
was
not
a
fair
procedure.
mr.
justice
white,
you
used
the
word
late
filers.
i
just
like
to
point
out,
we
were
on
time
filing.
we
filed
in
time.
we
were
treated
as
such.
we
simply
didn't
bring
the
suit
at
that
time
because
we
thought
we
would
get
the
same
protection
that
the
others
got
because
it
was
only
one
issue.
as
far
as
the
war
claims
issue
is
concern
mr.
chief
justice
that
was
never
raised
until
in
this
court.
the
war
claims
issue
is
an
afterthought,
when
we
asked
to
be
treated
the
same,
they
said,
no.
the
statute
of
limitations
bars
you
and
we're
not
going
to
go
through
this.
we
want
to
wind
up.
the
war
claims
is
an
afterthought
brought
in
here
that
is
irrelevant
because
the
real
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
treat,
give
the
assets.
these
aren't
assets
that
alarm
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh,
we
get
that
in
japan.
yes,
your
honor.
i've
never
said
we
could
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no.
we
had
to
send
in
the
certificates
to
deposit
your
honor,
we
didn't
send
those
in.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
the
claim,
there
was
a
timely
filing,
the
claim
was
dismissed
your
honor
when
we
didn't
get
send
in
the
certificates
of
deposit.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
think
it
just
--
it
is
the
only
thing
the
government
relies
on
is
the
fact
we
didn't
bring
the
court
action
because
we
could
have
lost
the
court
action
when
they
issued
the
schedule
in
61
without
us
on
it.
we
could
have
brought
the
court
action
at
that
time.
we
didn't
--
we're
--
but
just
remember
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
because
we
did
not
bring
suit
within
60
days
after
the
schedule
was
filed
in
61
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
have
the
second
your
honor.
i
think
the
government
has
made
clear
its
stands
ready
to
pay
anybody
who
is
not
barred
or
who
if
it's
told.
they're
ready
to
pay
him.
well,
you
see
they're
not
only
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
at
the
abe
rate.
which
is
not
the
total
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
no.
and
we're
only
doing
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
oh,
yes.
i
made
myself
clear,
we're
only
suing
for
the
abe
settlement.
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
precisely.
we
are
not
making
an
issue
of
that.
if
this
court
holds
as
i
have
urged
it
to
hold
that
the
government
is
estopped
or
their
limitations
is
tolled,
i
understand
the
government
because
they've
never
argued
anything.
they
would
pay

its
50%

they
paid
the

people
what
they
thought

what
they
put
in
in
dollars?
they
didn't
get

what
they
lost
was
their
interest

mr.

i
presume
it
would
be
6%
your
honor
and
that
came
to
about
the

a

i
don't
think

mr.

i
don't
know
whether
they
would've
had
defense.
they
would've
argued.
and
again,
i
--
while
you've
been
here
if
i
have
been
retained,
i
would've

arguing
that

was
estopped

tolled

but
they
would've

they
couldn't
had
a
defense
(voice

mr.

that's
correct.
and
your
honor
must
remember
that
only
1800
out
of
7500
did
that
though.
you
can
say
what
you
want
about
this
letter
not
being
insolvent.
but
only
1800
did
send
it

the

didn't

it

who

i
just
conclude
if
i
may
with
the
suggestion
that
when
it
is

that
someone
slept
on
their

for
waiting
two

mr.

well,
the
government
here
is

were
addressing
it
to
the
failure
to
bring
the
suit.
that
they
argued
to
us
in

before
but
in
their
brief
here
they
addressed
it
solely,
there's
a
sentence
i've
seen
in
the
brief.
it
says,
this
is
done
solely
because
of
the
statute
of
limitation
which
we
say
is
tolled
and
estopped
for
the
four
reasons
which
i
gave.
and
if
the
government

especially
on
the

do

mr.

oh,
i
think
they
are
in

plates
except
we
got
a
better
equity
in
the
sense
that
they're
small
people
whose

and
who
had
suffered

much
at
the

at
page
5
of
our
complaint

at
the
page
of
the
record
of
our
complaint,
we
asked
if
they
be
paid
in
the
same
conversion
ratio
as
the
plaintiffs
in
(inaudible)
v.
kennedy.
we
did
that
because
of
this
reason,
we
felt
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
we
--
i
can't
--
we
have
a
class
suit
in
which
the
-
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
in
japan?
no,
your
honor.
there
are
1600
people
there
and
i
suggested
earlier
that
the
government
had
mention
them
and
said,
isn't
too
bad
about
them
and
why
should
we
paid
because
of
them.
and
my
suggestion
was
the
two
of
our
--we
are
not,
as
i've
explained
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
are
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
--
making
that
point
but
we
are
saying
that
the
government
really
now
want
to
settle
this
after
your
honors
rule
if
it
should
be
favorable
to
us.
we
do
have
two
of
our
plaintiffs
who
are
in
that
category
--
mr.
joseph
l.rauh,
jr.
i
cannot
say
on
a
class
suit
what
would
happen.
you
always
has
--
your
honor
knows
and
as
it
imply,
you
always
have
to
give
notice.
if
we
were
to
win
we
go
back
to
the
district
court.
they'd
have
to
give
notice
to
everyone
and
if
someone
were
going
to
complain,
i'm
not
going
to
say
they
would.
i
am
of
course
bound
to
argue
that
for
the
complaint
namely
that
the
--
all
we
are
entitled
to
is
the
abe
settlement.
that's
all
we
sued
for.
we
sued
for
that
because
we
felt
the
government
was
a
trustee
of
funds
they
had
seized
which
funds
would
have
paid
our
deposit
holders
and
which
therefore
they
should
now
pay
to
us.
we
therefore
sued
for
the
exact
amount
because
we
felt
they
were
the
trustee
for
all
the
claimants.
thank
you.
