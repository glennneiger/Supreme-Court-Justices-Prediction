justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
largest
single
claim
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
could
find
out
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
action
from
your
adversary,
i'd
wished
you'd
let
the
clerk
know
because
he
i'd
like
to
know
whether
typical
that
--
whether
the
typical
claim
is
typical
or
whether
there
are
some
very
large
claims
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
rep
--
that
representation
was
not
a
willful
misrepresentation
or
it
was
not
a
misrepresentation
as
of
the
time
it
was
made
in
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
was
different
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
call
this
insulting?
why
do
you
say
insulting
mr.
rauh,
this
was
an
enemy
alien
seizure,
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
is
there
any
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
pay
these
people
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
apart
from
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
are
all
of
the
people
whom
in
your
group
citizens?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
point
--
your
point
is,
they
were
all
treated
the
same,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
mr.
posner.
you
mean
to
say
that
under
the
certificate
of
deposit
as
you
understand
that
repayment
could
be
demanded
only
in
yen?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
understanding
mr.
posner
that
all
of
these
people,
at
least
the
main
claimants
here
brought
this
class
action
were
represented
in
1961
by
a
law
firm.
i
noticed
that
the
letter,
exhibit
a
appearing
on
page
69
of
the
record,
copy
of
that
was
sent
to
a
well
known
law
firm?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
posner,
i
suppose
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
suppose
that
in
terms
of
policy,
the
objective
of
congress
so
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
this
money
goes
to
these
particular
claimants
against
the
yokohama
specie
bank
or
goes
into
the
war
claims
fund.
that's
what
will
happen
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
problem
here
and
as
i
understand
it,
you're
saying
that
the
government
did
not
feel
that
liberty
to
waive
the
statute
of
limitations
so
similar
that
you
could
--
the
alien
property
custodian
didn't
feel
that
way
because
what
it'd
be
doing
then
would
be
in
fact
taking
money
from
the
war
claims
fund
and
using
it
for
the
purposes
of
paying
people
who
--
my
hypothesis
did
not
have
a
--
strictly
go
right
to
it
because
of
their
failure
to
file
their
claims
in
time?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
here
mr.
rauh,
excuse
me.
you
say
you
--
your
--
the
people
that
you
represent
filed
--
made
timely
filing
of
their
claims?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
they
would
be
in
--
if
that's
so,
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
2%
or
whatever
it
is
when
the
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
no.
no,
not
in
japan,
not
japan
but
under
this
letter?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
--
then
what
you're
saying
now
and
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this
mr.
rauh.
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
there
was
a
timely
filing
but
that
the
claim
was
not
perfected.
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
it's
not
just
the
manner
of
you're
not
having
brought
coinage
in
the
--
within
a
specified
time?
justice
abe
fortas
now
not
--
for
just
a
second.
as
this
case
--
do
the
posture
of
this
case
now
then
and
as
i
understand
it
is
that
you're
not
entitled
to
anything
according
to
the
government's
view
because
your
claim
was
dismissed?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
so
we
have
before
us
two
issues
as
i
understand
it.
one
is
the
statute
of
limitations
whether
that
was
--
the
government
has
estopped
her,
there
was
tolling
or
what
not?
and
the
other
--
the
others
question
is
to
the
amount
of
recovery
if
you
recover
at
all,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
they're
ready
to
pay
you
what?
justice
abe
fortas
--
prewar
rate,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i'm
--
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
that
you're
not
making
any
issue
then
of
the
government's
statement
to
you
that,
if
you
got
a
claim,
i'll
pay
you
at
the
abe
rate.
we
will
not
pay
you
at
the
full
prewar
rate,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
still
indignant
because
the
letter
when
it
was
sent
out
to
your
clients'
awkward
payment
at
the
post
war
rate,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
that
you're
now
willing
to
take,
i
gather
you're
now
willing
to
acquiesce
and
take
50%
of
the
prewar
rate,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
largest
single
claim
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
