justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
posner,
could
i
ask
you?
the
statute
of
limitations
on
which
you
rely,
that
contains
34
(f)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
that
applies
--
34
(f)
applies
in
the
schedule
provisions
apply
only
where
their
--
where
the
assets
are
less
than
the
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that
true
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
there
ever
be
any
money
left
over
to
go
to
some
war
claims
claimants?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
got
to
pay
off
with
the
post
war
rate
--
would
the
claims
--
would
the
funds
still
be
insolvent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
that
you
ever
insist
on
a
statute
of
limitations
against
these
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
condition
of
the
statute
just
isn't
satisfied
and
if
they
--
if
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
say,
we're
going
to
pay
you
off
at
the
post
war
rate
which
you
did,
why
is
there
any
insolvencies?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
on
that
statement,
right
then
and
there
accepting
it
was
the
claim
--
was
the
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
no,
then
34
(f)
doesn't
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
where
do
you
--
but
what
--
what
do
you
suppose
the
purposes
of
putting
the
60-day
statute
of
limitations
in
34
(f).
that's
--
that
short
of
--
that
sort
of
limitation
is
true.
what's
the
purpose
of
--
what's
its
function
in
that
context?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
be
equitably
allocated
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
an
earlier
date.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
of
--
an
ordinary
bankruptcy,
there's
--
there
are
limitations
theory
and
people
have
to
file
their
claims
in
a
certain
time
would've
been
--
if
so
happens,
is
there
any
assets
left
over.late
filers
can
get
paid.
you
think
some
such
a
rule
should
be
applied
here
where
there
are
obviously
assets
left
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
choice
is
between
paying
these
people
or
some
claims
funds.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
got
this
--
this
is
much
--
the
question
i
asked
you,
wouldn't
really
go
to
whether
or
that
--
perhaps
whether
you
could
--
at
what
rate
you
have
--
might
have
to
pay
but
on
your
position
--
your
position
is
that
you
needn't
even
pay
these
people
the
2%.
this
is
the
question
of
whether
you
them
100%
some
off
dollar
or
2%,
you
say,
you
don't
need
to
pay
them
anything
because
the
statute
of
limitations
have
run
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
i'm
just
wondering
if
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
posner,
if
a
--
assuming
that
an
account
like
this
is
not
insolvent
that
there's
$10
millions
available
for
claims
and
there're
only
$8
million
in
claims.
and
claims
were
filed
and
the
custodian
disallows
the
one
that
--
for
one
reason
or
another.
is
there
any
position
for
that
to
disallowed
claimants
to
sue
or
as
he
gets
precluded
by
the
administrative
determination?
and
if
he
can
sue,
what's
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
if
--
the
situation
--
a
situation
to
which
34
(f)
does
not
apply,
is
there
another
statute
of
limitations
on
suit
in
those
--
i
know
34
(f)
sets
60-day?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
34
(f)
says
no
suits
under
the
--
those
provided
for
here,
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
they
have
had
a
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
rauh,
you
really
can't
speak
for
everyone
in
terms
of
saying
that
all
you're
suing
for
is
the
abe
settlement.
you're
entitled
to
sue,
your
not
valid
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
i'm
not
sure
any
judge
would
recommend
during
this
--
on
the
issues
of
this
case
become
a
statute
of
limitation
would
bind
everybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
don't
speak
for
all
the
people
who
withdrew
their
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
report
--
represent
those
people
that
were
paid
off
in
yen?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
--
all
the
people
that
in
this
class
you
represent
would
be
bound
by
your
representations
here,
if
that
--
if
we
just
assume
that
you
won
this
case
and
extends
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
far
to
your
suit.
some
of
your
clients
discharged
you
and
said,
we
want
our
own
lawyer
and
furthermore,
we
won't
be
bound
by
that.
if
were
not
--
we're
going
litigate
and
if
cert
is
granted
again
on
the
duetsche
bank
issue?
