mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
asked
for
affirmance
here
on
two
independent
grounds.
first,
we
invoked
the
settled
rule
that
the
government
may
not
be
a
estopped
by
the
conduct
of
its
officials
to
plead
limitations
as
a
defense.
this
is
because
in
a
suit
against
the
sovereign,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
jurisdictional
and
a
warrant
of
jurisdiction
may
not
be
waived.
now,
there's
no
constitutional
issue
in
this
case,
there
is
no
taking.
there
was
a
seizure
of
some
of
the
assets
of
the
debtor,
the
yokohama
bank.
the
yokohama
bank
or
its
successor
bank
remained
in
existence,
remained
amenable
to
sue
and
as
mr.
rauh
pointed
out,
many
of
these
claimants
had
in
fact
sought
recovery
against
the
bank
rather
than
against
the
vested
property.
and
now,
i
will
leave
further
discussion
of
that
broader
principle
on
which
we
rely
to
our
brief
and
turn
to
the
narrower
ground
and
that
is
that
even
where
there's
a
suit
between
private
parties
to
which
the
doctrine
of
estoppel
could
properly
be
applied,
there's
no
factual
basis
for
its
invocation
here
for
there
was
no
arbitrariness
and
no
injustice
or
unfairness
in
the
manner
in
which
the
government
process
these
claims.
and
before
i
review
the
various
events
which
lead
up
to
this
suit,
i
would
mention
one
issue,
one
fact
which
seems
to
us
extraneous
to
the
legal
issues
here
although
it
is
--
has
been
stressed
heavily
in
petitioner's
briefs
and
that
is
the
nationality
of
these
claimants.
this
suit
does
not
arise
from
any
measure
taken
by
the
government
against
japanese-americans
in
world
war
ii.
section
34,
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
which
is
the
statute
in
suit
here
is
not
a
law
which
relates
to
any
particular
national
group.
it
is
simply
a
provision
for
american
creditors,
whatever
their
national
background
--
of
enemy
concerns
whose
property
was
vested.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
this
includes
resident
aliens
who
are
not
actually
paroled
or
in
turned
under
the
alien
enemy
act
in
world
war
ii.
these
individuals
mr.
rauh
pointed
out
were
residents
rather
than
citizens
at
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
that
would
be
the
identical
case,
statute
of
--
would
apply
identically,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct,
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
yes.
there's
no
dispute
on
the
propriety
of
the
taking,
yes.
but
many
of
americans
of
every
national
background
had
--
were
creditors
of
these
enemy
enterprises.
most
of
the
thousands
of
people
who
have
prosecuted
claims
under
section
34
(f)
have
not
been
japanese-americans.
in
order
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
yes,
i
was
about
to
say.
nor
is
there
any
suggestion
here
that
these
claimants
in
the
processing
of
their
claims
were
treated
any
differently
from
all
other
claimants
under
section
34
and
in
addition
as
we
point
out,
the
individuals
who
actually
brought
this
litigation
were
represented
at
all
relevant
times
by
distinguished
members
of
the
california
bar
who
were
kept
apprised
by
the
alien
property
office
of
all
the
developments
in
their
proceeding.
now
that
aside,
let
me
retrace
the
significant
steps
in
the
processing
of
these
claims
and
try
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
undoubtedly
true.
what
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
one
point
is
this,
in
order
to
bring
this
class
action
on
behalf
of
these
4100
claimants,
all
one
needed
was
a
single
representative
of
the
class,
a
single
individual
and
a
number
of
individuals,
how
many
i
don't
know
but
at
least
the
named
plaintiffs
here
did
have
counsel.
now
as
i
will
go
on
to
show
that
even
with
respect
to
individuals
who
didn't
have
counsel,
we
believe
that
the
notice
that
was
given
by
the
government
here
was
all
that
the
statute
or
that
fairness
they
require,
and
i'll
try
to
explain
that
at
greater
length.
now,
i
begin
with
the
letter
which
mr.
rauh
mentioned,
which
the
alien
property
office
sent
to
all
claimants
including
the
petitioners
here
and
where
they
had
counsel
--
of
record
their
counsel.
in
1959,
notify
me
--
that
was
the
amount
that
the
office
was
prepared
to
allow
and
outlining
the
procedures
of
four
payment
and
the
judicial
remedies
that
they
would
have
and
this
letter
is
printed
at
pages
6
and
at
29
of
the
record,
and
the
letter
made
four
points.
first
of
all,
it
reported
the
ruling
of
the
office
that
the
claims
could
not
be
allowed
in
full
because
of
the
post
war
decline
in
the
value
of
the
yen.
i
stressed
the
letter
--
stated
what
the
department
of
justice
had
decided
on
this
legal
question.
it
did
not
say
that
--
it
did
not
represent
that
in
fact
a
payment
could
only
be
made
at
that
rate
because
it
went
on
to
explain
that
there
were
judicial
remedies
for
--
of
individuals
who
were
not
satisfied
with
the
department's
ruling.
now,
in
this
--
the
rule
in
question
has
been
described
by
petitioners
as
an
arbitrary
one
in
which
the
government
later
repudiated
and
i
--
it
maybe
helpful
to
explain
briefly
what
this
issue
was.
these
claimants
had
deposited
dollars
in
the
american
branches
of
the
yokohama
bank
and
had
received
in
exchange
certificates,
interest
bearing,
certificates
of
deposits,
six
months
certificates
deposit
which
recited
and
recited
only
that
the
bank
was
making
a
deposit
of
yen
in
its
home
office
in
japan
and
that
the
certificate
could
be
repay
--
would
be
repaid
in
japan
in
yen.
now
of
course,
when
these
depositors
asked
for
their
money
back
from
the
alien
property
office,
they
were
asking
for
dollars
and
it
was
necessary
to
translate
this
yen
obligation
into
dollars.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
on
the
face
of
the
certificate,
that
is
clear.
now
--
and
it
was
because
the
certificate
was
unequivocal
on
its
face
that
the
government
relied
upon
the
rule
of
the
deutsche
bank
case,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes
which
holds
that
obligations
--
which
held
incidentally
in
the
context
of
an
alien
property
bank
deposit
case
arising
from
world
war
i,
that
an
obligation
payable
in
foreign
currency
in
a
foreign
country.
in
that
case,
the
creditor
takes
the
risk
of
currency
fluctuation
right
to
the
day
of
judgment.
now,
it's
true
that
there
was
a
practice
of
these
japanese
banks
on
the
west
coast
of
repurchasing
certificates
in
dollars.
now,
it's
a
question,
a
difficult
question,
whether
what
the
banks
were
doing
was
simply
accommodating
customers
or
whether
in
fact
the
banks
practice
a
very
--
the
obligation
on
this
certificate
and
made
it
an
obligation
to
repay
in
dollars.
this
is
a
closed
question
--
it
has
never
been
authoritatively
resolved
that
i
stressed
that
it's
a
genuine
question,
and
when
the
alien
property
office
resolved
it
in
favor
of
the
post
war
rate,
it
was
not
acting
arbitrarily,
it
had
a
reasonable
legal
basis
for
its
action.
now,
this
matter
in
1959
went
on
to
inform
each
claimant
that
if
he
desired
payment
of
his
claim
in
the
amount
allowed,
he
should
submit
his
original
certificates
of
deposit
to
the
alien
property
office
or
if
he'd
lost
or
mislead
them,
an
affidavit
stating
that
he
had
not
received
payment
elsewhere.
this
also
was
not
an
arbitrary
requirement.
it
was
not
a
mere
barrier
placed
in
the
path
of
people
trying
to
collect
their
money
because,
the
area
--
the
office
knew
that
many
of
these
claimants
had
sought
a
recovery
directly
from
the
bank
in
japan
and
the
office
felt
that
it
ought
not
pay
claims
that
had
already
been
satisfied.
now
thirdly,
the
letter
informed
each
claimant
that
actual
payment
of
the
claim
would
have
to
await
the
compilation
of
a
final
schedule
which
listed
all
claims
and
hereto,
for
--
this
is
incidentally
expressly
required
by
the
statute
and
this
toois
not
an
arbitrary
requirement
far
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
the
situation
here
because
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
you
see
the
original
client
--
the
statute,
being
that
is
the
insolvency
provision
of
section
34
(f)
is
triggered
by
the
face
of
the
claim
by
the
potential
liability
that
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
had
we
--
had
the
payment
been
made
at
the
post
war
rate,
probably
not,
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
when
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
statute
have
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
no.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
government
said
that
in
its
view,
payment
should
be
made
at
the
post
war
rate.
there
were
still
a
question
whether
a
court
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no
but
we
--
but
the
government
had
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
no,
no,
no
be
that
--
34
(f)
wouldn't
use
--
to
apply
34
(f),
if
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
claim
because
you
do
not
know
how
much
of
that
claim
will
ultimately
be
allowed.
the
alien
property
custodian
did
not
know
that
his
post
war
exchange
rate
would
be
sustained
in
the
courts
had
it
been
rejected,
had
all
of
these
claimants
been
entitled
to
collect
that
the
prewar
rate
that
would
have
more
than
exhausted
the
fund.
the
fund
was
not
large
enough
for
all
these
claims.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
its
function
is
to
permit
the
fund,
the
account,
the
alien
property
account
of
the
particular
debtor
to
be
wound
up
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
and
equitably
allocated.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
now
you
see,
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
before
payment
was
made
to
anybody
here,
there
was
this
lawsuit
brought
by
a
large
group
of
claimants.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
there
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
--
well,
that
--
that
is
true
and
that's
a
--
that
i
think
is
a
significant
point.
to
skip
ahead
momentarily,
when
the
government
made
the
settlement
with
the
60
--
with
the
1800
claimants
who
had
submitted
their
original
certificates
and
we
brought
a
suit
against
the
alien
property
office
challenging
this
exchange
rate.
when
it
did
that,
it
gave
them
$6
million.
it
assumed
that
this
was
the
end
of
the
yokohama
bank
alien
property
account
and
that
the
surplus
could
then
be
paid
over
to
the
war
claims
fund.
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
alien
property
program
is
to
create
a
fund
to
the
satisfaction
of
war
claims
because
the
alien
property
--
vested
property
is
the
only
source
of
that
fund.
in
other
words,
there
was
reliance
by
the
government
on
the
fact
that
the
settlement
with
the
1800
wound
up
the
entire
account.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
true.
the
retainer
agreement
which
was
filed
with
this
alien
property
office,
was
filed
in
1955
on
behalf
of
all
these
individuals
who
brought
suit.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
$6
million
was
paid
including
counsel
fees
to
the
plaintiffs
who
sued
and
there's
about
$11
million
remaining.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
$11
million.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no
one
is
precisely
sure
but
it
is
believed
that
they
could
be
satisfied
out
of
this
fund.
there's
some
question
about
these
additional
1600
individuals
who
filed
notices
of
cancellation
indicating
that
they
would
seek
recovery
in
japan.
in
fact,
according
to
the
alien
property
officials,
many
of
these
people
did
not.
it
is
believed
did
not
recover
--
did
not
go
against
the
japanese
banks.
so
there
are
some
questions
whether
the
fund
might
be
strained
if
you
include
them.
there
are
also
a
number
of
other
japanese
claimants
against
another
bank
who
--
for
whom
there
are
no
more
vested
assets
available.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
don't
read
it
as
that,
but
the
paragraph
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
that
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
proceeding
sentence
which
states
that
the
director
of
the
alien
property
office
decided
a
decision
the
attorney
general
had
declined
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
to
review
that
claims
based
on
such
certificates
should
be
allowed
at
the
post
war
rate.
thus,
the
current
rate
of
exchange
must
be
used.
i
take
it
that
it
thus
means
that
under
the
decision
of
the
alien
property
office,
the
current
rate
must
be
used
and
that
is
the
only
rate
under
which
the
department
was
offering
payment.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
that
one
would
read
it
to
mean
that
the
department
was
not
prepared
to
pay
any
larger
rate
but
on
the
top
of
the
next
page,
page
7,
in
pointing
out
that
payments
cannot
be
made
until
the
final
schedule
was
mailed.
it
points
out
that
within
60
days
after
the
issuance
of
the
schedule,
any
agreed
compliant
may
file
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
i
assume
that
a
person
who
disagreed
with
the
department's
application
of
the
post
war
rate
would
consider
himself
highly
aggrieved
by
the
schedule
that
was
mailed
and
i
point
out
that
18
--
a
suit
was
brought
in
timely
fashion
by
individual
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
by
individuals
who
had
received
the
identical
letter.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
and
who
had
awaited
the
mailing
of
the
final
schedule
and
within
60
days
not
liking
the
size
of
the
claim
that
was
shown
on
the
schedule
for
them.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
there's
nothing
in
the
printed
record
of
this
case
as
to
the
department's
motivations
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
judging
from
the
--
and
i'm
reluctant
to
go
outside
the
reference
state
what
were
the
considerations
that
the
department
--
that
motivated
the
department
but
judging
from
the
face
of
the
statutory
scheme.
first
of
all,
this
court
having
granted
the
claimant's
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
case
being
a
closed
one,
there
was
no
assurance
of
a
government
victory.
this
made
a
settlement
at
50
cents
on
the
dollar
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
the
position
would
the
same.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
we
--
we
see
no
invidious
distinction
--
discrimination
between
individuals
who
have
bring
timely
suits
and
those
who
fail
to
do
so.
but
what
i
am
--
what
i
do
want
to
suggest
is
that
when
the
government
settled
on
50
cents
on
a
dollar
and
on
a
basis
would
seem
to
leave
a
large
surplus
for
the
war
claims
fund.
and
i
stress
again,
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
alien
property
program
is
to
create
a
fund
from
the
proceeds
of
vested
property
for
the
war
claims
fund.
this
50
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
if
the
proper
--
to
the
extent
that
the
property
was
property
of
the
enemy
of
enemy
concerns.
yes,
those
proceeds
go
to
the
war
claims
fund
to
the
extent
that
there
are
valid
claims
of
americans
against
the
fund.
those
claims
must
be
paid
before
the
net
proceeds
are
covered
into
the
fund.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
these
were
not
valid
claims
because
the
statute
of
limitation
is
finished
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
were
there
no
statute
of
limitations
problem,
the
government
would
have
offered
them
the
same
settlement
as
those
litigants
who
would
sue.
the
government
here
is
in
the
position
of
a
trustee
since
a
purpose
of
the
alien
property
program
is
to
create
a
fund
for
war
claimants.
the
government
does
not
feel
that
it
ought
to
waive,
if
it
could
waive
valid
legal
defenses
against
creditors.
and
the
feeling,
if
the
belief
was
and
is
that
individuals
who
will
adequately
and
fully
apprise
of
their
judicial
remedies
had
failed
to
bring
timely
suit
were
not
entitled
to
participate
in
the
settlement
the
distinction
being
one
of
the
most
fundamental
in
the
law
between
those
who
pressed
their
rights
and
those
who
sleep
on
their
rights.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
terms
of
getting
by
as
cheaply
as
it
could
but
i've
--
i
would
submit
that
it
was
the
understanding
of
congress
that
the
government
would
interpose
any
legal
to
--
advice.
as
a
matter
fact,
it's
expressing
the
statute
that
the
government
may
interpose
any
legal
defense
which
the
debtor
himself
would've
had
to
the
claim
just
as
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
not
those
whose
property
had
been
taken.
they
were
dealt
within
another
provision
but
those
who
were
creditors,
those
who
had
claims
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
in
this
situation.
i
don't
--
we
don't
find
any
purpose
to
require
the
government
to
pay
untimely
claims
which
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
to
pay
claims
which
cannot
be
enforced
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
certainly,
the
government
is
required
to
pay
claims
that
are
valid.
our
position
is
only
that
claims
that
were
not
prosecuted
within
the
time
--
limitations
in
the
statute
are
not
valid
claims
we
cannot
be
paid.
and
i
point
out,
by
stressing
this
connection
that
the
issue
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
the
underlined
issue
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
don't
--
we
would
not
agree
that
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
question
but
we
would
not
agree
that
there
was
any
purpose
to
pay
untimely
claims.
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
in
the
act
and
we
assumed
that
it
must
be
complied
with.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
and
again
i
stress,
not
only
in
this
1958
letter
which
was
sent
to
all
of
these
claimants
and
to
counsel
for
those
who
had
counsel.
but
again,
in
1961
when
the
final
schedule
was
mailed
to
everybody,
to
all
of
these
claimants.
it
in
--
this
is
a
one
page
letter,
this
at
page
34
of
the
record
which
stated
explicitly,
that
anyone
who
deemed
himself
agreed
by
the
final
schedule
had
60
days
within
which
to
bring
suit
and
the
class
here
involved
individuals
whose
claims
did
not
appear
on
the
schedule
because
they
had
not
submitted
the
original
certificates.
new
per
--
had
--
we're
given
adequate
notice,
ample
notice
that
they
had
60
days
in
which
to
sue.
why
didn't
sue,
we
don't
know?
many
others
similarly
situated,
this
other
class
of
1,800
did.
my
only
point
is
that
their
failure
to
sue
promptly
cannot
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
government
had
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct
and
i
will
just
stress
in
reply
to
that
as
i
said
earlier
that
it
has
never
been
suggested
that
the
alien
property
office
treated
these
claimants
or
japanese-americans
generally,
any
differently,
from
any
corporate
or
other
individuals
having
claims
under
section
34
(f).
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
the
ultimate
outcome.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
and
there's
an
additional
answer
to
that
and
that
is
that
when
the
government
settled
with
the
original
group
of
plaintiffs.
it
was
on
the
understanding
that
this
would
wind
up
the
account
and
leave
a
surplus
for
the
war
claims
fund.
has
the
government
not
relied
on
the
60
days
statute
of
limitations
as
excluding
any
possibility,
any
further
liability
on
the
account
it
might
not
have
settled
or
it
might
have
settled
on
different
terms.
and
this
underlines
the
practical
importance
in
this
situation
of
having
a
rigid
date,
a
bar
date
after
which
the
office
can
with
confidence
wind
up
the
account
and
distribute
it
among
the
various
beneficiaries.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
--
i'm
not
sure
i
wholly
understand
but
the
individuals
who
are
represented
here
are
people
who
did
not
submit
the
original
certificate.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
to
say
they
did
not
prosecute
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
their
administrative
remedy.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
34
(d)
--
the
--
this
--
its
34
(e),
this
--
the
provision
which
relates
to
none
(inaudible)
--
to
solvent
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
death
claims
provides
for
suit
within
60
days
after
the
--
a
custodian
has
mailed
his
determination
to
the
claimant.
the
only
difference
in
terms
of
the
statute
of
limitations
between
the
two
provisions
has
been
in
the
case
of
the
insolvent
fund.
the
statute
doesn't
run
until
the
custodian
has
brought
up
his
final
schedule
showing
all
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
no
suit
can
be
prosecuted
except
in
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
your
honors,
it's
the
kind
of
problem
that
arises
customably
in
the
government.
an
example
would
be
a
claim
under
the
social
security
act.
if
you
file
a
claim
with
the
social
security
administration
and
there
legal
counsel
makes
a
determination
that
you're
not
entitled
to
be
paid,
they
will
send
you
a
letter
saying,
i'm
sorry.
we
can't
pay
you
under
our
view
of
the
law.
now,
then
you
have
60
days
there
as
here
to
go
into
court
and
challenge
that
determination
as
arbitrary
or
as
unlawful.
now
very
frequently,
when
the
government
is
sued
like
any
litigant,
like
any
defendant
act
as
the
matter
proceeds
through
the
courts.
the
government
assesses
its
chances
of
victory
in
terms
of
offers
per
settlements
that
are
made
and
very
frequently
compromise
this
case
just
like
other
litigants.
when
it
does
so
like
any
other
litigant,
the
government
does
not
necessarily
either
capitulate,
here
it
didn't
capitulate
that
it
paid
only
half
of
the
--
a
man's
claimed
and
nor
does
it
acknowledge
that
from
the
very
outset
it
had
made
an
error
and
acted
arbitrarily.
as
a
matter
fact
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
there
is
no
--
it
did
not.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
absolutely
not.
the
government
had
prevailed
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
a
very
technical
issue
having
to
do
with
the
rule
of
--
with
the
application
of
the
duetsche
bank
opinion.
there
was
room
for
a
court
to
go
either
way
and
the
government
felt
that
while
victory
wasn't
assured
for.
on
the
other
hand,
neither
was
defeat
and
therefore
did
not
simply
pay
these
people
what
they
were
asking
and
capitulate.
it
bargained
for
a
--
what
seemed
like
a
fair
50-50
settlement.
the
government
has
never
acknowledged
and
does
not
acknowledge
now
that
the
alien
property
office
was
wrong.
let
alone
arbitrary
in
its
determination
that
the
post
war
rate
had
to
apply
because
the
certificate
on
its
face
said
that
this
was
an
obligation
payable
in
yen
in
japan.
it
is
--
and
it
is
not
a
case
where
a
misrepresentation
was
made
that
it
was
ever
suggested
to
these
individuals
that
the
government
absolutely
would
not
pay
except
at
this
low
rate.
of
course
the
possibility
remained
open
and
it
was
alluded
to
in
the
very
first
letter
that
the
courts
would
compel
the
government
to
pay
more
or
that
in
the
event
of
the
--
a
judicial
attack,
the
government
as
a
matter
of
prudence
and
good
executive
management
would
compromise
before
a
final
judgment.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice,
when
we
--
when
the
government
compromise
this
case
after
certiorari
was
granted
we
didn't
--
it
was
not
done
because
the
government
felt
that
the
granting
of
certiorari
was
tantamount
to
a
reversal
of
the
decisions
below.
but
because
a
settlement
offer
was
made
and
the
settlement
offer
seem
reasonable
under
circumstances
but
the
effect
of
this
settlement
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
because
the
department
was
afraid
that
the
supreme
court
might
not
agree
with
its
feel
of
the
law
as
happens
many
times.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
i
think
not.
i
think
the
fact
of
compromise
is
not
a
repudiation
of
the
litigant's
original
position.
it
is
not
a
confession
of
error
nor
did
the
settlement
i
might
add
prejudice
the
individuals
here.
as
far
as
the
legal
issues
are
concern,
it
seems
to
me
they
would
be
identical
if
the
case
had
proceeded
to
a
final
judgment
and
they
had
received
their
--
all
their
money.
we
would
still
be
arguing
that
the
present
claims
were
time
barred.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
think
it
would
have
change
the
facts
because
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
would
have
to
venture
the
view
that
it
could
not
because
the
--
this
court's
adjudication
would
have
affected
only
those
claimants
who
had
sued
within
the
60-day
period.
and
it
could
not
--
an
appeal
taken
by
one
group
of
or
a
litigation
on
behalf
of
one
class
that
does
not
--
and
knew
it
to
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
unfortunately
slept
on
their
rights.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
asked
for
affirmance
here
on
two
independent
grounds.
first,
we
invoked
the
settled
rule
that
the
government
may
not
be
a
estopped
by
the
conduct
of
its
officials
to
plead
limitations
as
a
defense.
this
is
because
in
a
suit
against
the
sovereign,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
jurisdictional
and
a
warrant
of
jurisdiction
may
not
be
waived.
now,
there's
no
constitutional
issue
in
this
case,
there
is
no
taking.
there
was
a
seizure
of
some
of
the
assets
of
the
debtor,
the
yokohama
bank.
the
yokohama
bank
or
its
successor
bank
remained
in
existence,
remained
amenable
to
sue
and
as
mr.
rauh
pointed
out,
many
of
these
claimants
had
in
fact
sought
recovery
against
the
bank
rather
than
against
the
vested
property.
and
now,
i
will
leave
further
discussion
of
that
broader
principle
on
which
we
rely
to
our
brief
and
turn
to
the
narrower
ground
and
that
is
that
even
where
there's
a
suit
between
private
parties
to
which
the
doctrine
of
estoppel
could
properly
be
applied,
there's
no
factual
basis
for
its
invocation
here
for
there
was
no
arbitrariness
and
no
injustice
or
unfairness
in
the
manner
in
which
the
government
process
these
claims.
and
before
i
review
the
various
events
which
lead
up
to
this
suit,
i
would
mention
one
issue,
one
fact
which
seems
to
us
extraneous
to
the
legal
issues
here
although
it
is
--
has
been
stressed
heavily
in
petitioner's
briefs
and
that
is
the
nationality
of
these
claimants.
this
suit
does
not
arise
from
any
measure
taken
by
the
government
against
japanese-americans
in
world
war
ii.
section
34,
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
which
is
the
statute
in
suit
here
is
not
a
law
which
relates
to
any
particular
national
group.
it
is
simply
a
provision
for
american
creditors,
whatever
their
national
background
--
of
enemy
concerns
whose
property
was
vested.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
this
includes
resident
aliens
who
are
not
actually
paroled
or
in
turned
under
the
alien
enemy
act
in
world
war
ii.
these
individuals
mr.
rauh
pointed
out
were
residents
rather
than
citizens
at
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
that
would
be
the
identical
case,
statute
of
--
would
apply
identically,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct,
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
yes.
there's
no
dispute
on
the
propriety
of
the
taking,
yes.
but
many
of
americans
of
every
national
background
had
--
were
creditors
of
these
enemy
enterprises.
most
of
the
thousands
of
people
who
have
prosecuted
claims
under
section
34
(f)
have
not
been
japanese-americans.
in
order
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
yes,
i
was
about
to
say.
nor
is
there
any
suggestion
here
that
these
claimants
in
the
processing
of
their
claims
were
treated
any
differently
from
all
other
claimants
under
section
34
and
in
addition
as
we
point
out,
the
individuals
who
actually
brought
this
litigation
were
represented
at
all
relevant
times
by
distinguished
members
of
the
california
bar
who
were
kept
apprised
by
the
alien
property
office
of
all
the
developments
in
their
proceeding.
now
that
aside,
let
me
retrace
the
significant
steps
in
the
processing
of
these
claims
and
try
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
undoubtedly
true.
what
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
one
point
is
this,
in
order
to
bring
this
class
action
on
behalf
of
these
4100
claimants,
all
one
needed
was
a
single
representative
of
the
class,
a
single
individual
and
a
number
of
individuals,
how
many
i
don't
know
but
at
least
the
named
plaintiffs
here
did
have
counsel.
now
as
i
will
go
on
to
show
that
even
with
respect
to
individuals
who
didn't
have
counsel,
we
believe
that
the
notice
that
was
given
by
the
government
here
was
all
that
the
statute
or
that
fairness
they
require,
and
i'll
try
to
explain
that
at
greater
length.
now,
i
begin
with
the
letter
which
mr.
rauh
mentioned,
which
the
alien
property
office
sent
to
all
claimants
including
the
petitioners
here
and
where
they
had
counsel
--
of
record
their
counsel.
in
1959,
notify
me
--
that
was
the
amount
that
the
office
was
prepared
to
allow
and
outlining
the
procedures
of
four
payment
and
the
judicial
remedies
that
they
would
have
and
this
letter
is
printed
at
pages
6
and
at
29
of
the
record,
and
the
letter
made
four
points.
first
of
all,
it
reported
the
ruling
of
the
office
that
the
claims
could
not
be
allowed
in
full
because
of
the
post
war
decline
in
the
value
of
the
yen.
i
stressed
the
letter
--
stated
what
the
department
of
justice
had
decided
on
this
legal
question.
it
did
not
say
that
--
it
did
not
represent
that
in
fact
a
payment
could
only
be
made
at
that
rate
because
it
went
on
to
explain
that
there
were
judicial
remedies
for
--
of
individuals
who
were
not
satisfied
with
the
department's
ruling.
now,
in
this
--
the
rule
in
question
has
been
described
by
petitioners
as
an
arbitrary
one
in
which
the
government
later
repudiated
and
i
--
it
maybe
helpful
to
explain
briefly
what
this
issue
was.
these
claimants
had
deposited
dollars
in
the
american
branches
of
the
yokohama
bank
and
had
received
in
exchange
certificates,
interest
bearing,
certificates
of
deposits,
six
months
certificates
deposit
which
recited
and
recited
only
that
the
bank
was
making
a
deposit
of
yen
in
its
home
office
in
japan
and
that
the
certificate
could
be
repay
--
would
be
repaid
in
japan
in
yen.
now
of
course,
when
these
depositors
asked
for
their
money
back
from
the
alien
property
office,
they
were
asking
for
dollars
and
it
was
necessary
to
translate
this
yen
obligation
into
dollars.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
on
the
face
of
the
certificate,
that
is
clear.
now
--
and
it
was
because
the
certificate
was
unequivocal
on
its
face
that
the
government
relied
upon
the
rule
of
the
deutsche
bank
case,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes
which
holds
that
obligations
--
which
held
incidentally
in
the
context
of
an
alien
property
bank
deposit
case
arising
from
world
war
i,
that
an
obligation
payable
in
foreign
currency
in
a
foreign
country.
in
that
case,
the
creditor
takes
the
risk
of
currency
fluctuation
right
to
the
day
of
judgment.
now,
it's
true
that
there
was
a
practice
of
these
japanese
banks
on
the
west
coast
of
repurchasing
certificates
in
dollars.
now,
it's
a
question,
a
difficult
question,
whether
what
the
banks
were
doing
was
simply
accommodating
customers
or
whether
in
fact
the
banks
practice
a
very
--
the
obligation
on
this
certificate
and
made
it
an
obligation
to
repay
in
dollars.
this
is
a
closed
question
--
it
has
never
been
authoritatively
resolved
that
i
stressed
that
it's
a
genuine
question,
and
when
the
alien
property
office
resolved
it
in
favor
of
the
post
war
rate,
it
was
not
acting
arbitrarily,
it
had
a
reasonable
legal
basis
for
its
action.
now,
this
matter
in
1959
went
on
to
inform
each
claimant
that
if
he
desired
payment
of
his
claim
in
the
amount
allowed,
he
should
submit
his
original
certificates
of
deposit
to
the
alien
property
office
or
if
he'd
lost
or
mislead
them,
an
affidavit
stating
that
he
had
not
received
payment
elsewhere.
this
also
was
not
an
arbitrary
requirement.
it
was
not
a
mere
barrier
placed
in
the
path
of
people
trying
to
collect
their
money
because,
the
area
--
the
office
knew
that
many
of
these
claimants
had
sought
a
recovery
directly
from
the
bank
in
japan
and
the
office
felt
that
it
ought
not
pay
claims
that
had
already
been
satisfied.
now
thirdly,
the
letter
informed
each
claimant
that
actual
payment
of
the
claim
would
have
to
await
the
compilation
of
a
final
schedule
which
listed
all
claims
and
hereto,
for
--
this
is
incidentally
expressly
required
by
the
statute
and
this
toois
not
an
arbitrary
requirement
far
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
the
situation
here
because
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
you
see
the
original
client
--
the
statute,
being
that
is
the
insolvency
provision
of
section
34
(f)
is
triggered
by
the
face
of
the
claim
by
the
potential
liability
that
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
had
we
--
had
the
payment
been
made
at
the
post
war
rate,
probably
not,
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
when
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
statute
have
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
no.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
government
said
that
in
its
view,
payment
should
be
made
at
the
post
war
rate.
there
were
still
a
question
whether
a
court
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no
but
we
--
but
the
government
had
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
no,
no,
no
be
that
--
34
(f)
wouldn't
use
--
to
apply
34
(f),
if
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
claim
because
you
do
not
know
how
much
of
that
claim
will
ultimately
be
allowed.
the
alien
property
custodian
did
not
know
that
his
post
war
exchange
rate
would
be
sustained
in
the
courts
had
it
been
rejected,
had
all
of
these
claimants
been
entitled
to
collect
that
the
prewar
rate
that
would
have
more
than
exhausted
the
fund.
the
fund
was
not
large
enough
for
all
these
claims.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
its
function
is
to
permit
the
fund,
the
account,
the
alien
property
account
of
the
particular
debtor
to
be
wound
up
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
and
equitably
allocated.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
now
you
see,
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
before
payment
was
made
to
anybody
here,
there
was
this
lawsuit
brought
by
a
large
group
of
claimants.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
there
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
--
well,
that
--
that
is
true
and
that's
a
--
that
i
think
is
a
significant
point.
to
skip
ahead
momentarily,
when
the
government
made
the
settlement
with
the
60
--
with
the
1800
claimants
who
had
submitted
their
original
certificates
and
we
brought
a
suit
against
the
alien
property
office
challenging
this
exchange
rate.
when
it
did
that,
it
gave
them
$6
million.
it
assumed
that
this
was
the
end
of
the
yokohama
bank
alien
property
account
and
that
the
surplus
could
then
be
paid
over
to
the
war
claims
fund.
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
alien
property
program
is
to
create
a
fund
to
the
satisfaction
of
war
claims
because
the
alien
property
--
vested
property
is
the
only
source
of
that
fund.
in
other
words,
there
was
reliance
by
the
government
on
the
fact
that
the
settlement
with
the
1800
wound
up
the
entire
account.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
true.
the
retainer
agreement
which
was
filed
with
this
alien
property
office,
was
filed
in
1955
on
behalf
of
all
these
individuals
who
brought
suit.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
$6
million
was
paid
including
counsel
fees
to
the
plaintiffs
who
sued
and
there's
about
$11
million
remaining.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
$11
million.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no
one
is
precisely
sure
but
it
is
believed
that
they
could
be
satisfied
out
of
this
fund.
there's
some
question
about
these
additional
1600
individuals
who
filed
notices
of
cancellation
indicating
that
they
would
seek
recovery
in
japan.
in
fact,
according
to
the
alien
property
officials,
many
of
these
people
did
not.
it
is
believed
did
not
recover
--
did
not
go
against
the
japanese
banks.
so
there
are
some
questions
whether
the
fund
might
be
strained
if
you
include
them.
there
are
also
a
number
of
other
japanese
claimants
against
another
bank
who
--
for
whom
there
are
no
more
vested
assets
available.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
don't
read
it
as
that,
but
the
paragraph
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
that
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
proceeding
sentence
which
states
that
the
director
of
the
alien
property
office
decided
a
decision
the
attorney
general
had
declined
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
to
review
that
claims
based
on
such
certificates
should
be
allowed
at
the
post
war
rate.
thus,
the
current
rate
of
exchange
must
be
used.
i
take
it
that
it
thus
means
that
under
the
decision
of
the
alien
property
office,
the
current
rate
must
be
used
and
that
is
the
only
rate
under
which
the
department
was
offering
payment.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
that
one
would
read
it
to
mean
that
the
department
was
not
prepared
to
pay
any
larger
rate
but
on
the
top
of
the
next
page,
page
7,
in
pointing
out
that
payments
cannot
be
made
until
the
final
schedule
was
mailed.
it
points
out
that
within
60
days
after
the
issuance
of
the
schedule,
any
agreed
compliant
may
file
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
i
assume
that
a
person
who
disagreed
with
the
department's
application
of
the
post
war
rate
would
consider
himself
highly
aggrieved
by
the
schedule
that
was
mailed
and
i
point
out
that
18
--
a
suit
was
brought
in
timely
fashion
by
individual
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
by
individuals
who
had
received
the
identical
letter.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
and
who
had
awaited
the
mailing
of
the
final
schedule
and
within
60
days
not
liking
the
size
of
the
claim
that
was
shown
on
the
schedule
for
them.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
there's
nothing
in
the
printed
record
of
this
case
as
to
the
department's
motivations
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
judging
from
the
--
and
i'm
reluctant
to
go
outside
the
reference
state
what
were
the
considerations
that
the
department
--
that
motivated
the
department
but
judging
from
the
face
of
the
statutory
scheme.
first
of
all,
this
court
having
granted
the
claimant's
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
case
being
a
closed
one,
there
was
no
assurance
of
a
government
victory.
this
made
a
settlement
at
50
cents
on
the
dollar
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
the
position
would
the
same.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
we
--
we
see
no
invidious
distinction
--
discrimination
between
individuals
who
have
bring
timely
suits
and
those
who
fail
to
do
so.
but
what
i
am
--
what
i
do
want
to
suggest
is
that
when
the
government
settled
on
50
cents
on
a
dollar
and
on
a
basis
would
seem
to
leave
a
large
surplus
for
the
war
claims
fund.
and
i
stress
again,
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
alien
property
program
is
to
create
a
fund
from
the
proceeds
of
vested
property
for
the
war
claims
fund.
this
50
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
if
the
proper
--
to
the
extent
that
the
property
was
property
of
the
enemy
of
enemy
concerns.
yes,
those
proceeds
go
to
the
war
claims
fund
to
the
extent
that
there
are
valid
claims
of
americans
against
the
fund.
those
claims
must
be
paid
before
the
net
proceeds
are
covered
into
the
fund.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
these
were
not
valid
claims
because
the
statute
of
limitation
is
finished
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
were
there
no
statute
of
limitations
problem,
the
government
would
have
offered
them
the
same
settlement
as
those
litigants
who
would
sue.
the
government
here
is
in
the
position
of
a
trustee
since
a
purpose
of
the
alien
property
program
is
to
create
a
fund
for
war
claimants.
the
government
does
not
feel
that
it
ought
to
waive,
if
it
could
waive
valid
legal
defenses
against
creditors.
and
the
feeling,
if
the
belief
was
and
is
that
individuals
who
will
adequately
and
fully
apprise
of
their
judicial
remedies
had
failed
to
bring
timely
suit
were
not
entitled
to
participate
in
the
settlement
the
distinction
being
one
of
the
most
fundamental
in
the
law
between
those
who
pressed
their
rights
and
those
who
sleep
on
their
rights.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
terms
of
getting
by
as
cheaply
as
it
could
but
i've
--
i
would
submit
that
it
was
the
understanding
of
congress
that
the
government
would
interpose
any
legal
to
--
advice.
as
a
matter
fact,
it's
expressing
the
statute
that
the
government
may
interpose
any
legal
defense
which
the
debtor
himself
would've
had
to
the
claim
just
as
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
not
those
whose
property
had
been
taken.
they
were
dealt
within
another
provision
but
those
who
were
creditors,
those
who
had
claims
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
in
this
situation.
i
don't
--
we
don't
find
any
purpose
to
require
the
government
to
pay
untimely
claims
which
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
to
pay
claims
which
cannot
be
enforced
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
certainly,
the
government
is
required
to
pay
claims
that
are
valid.
our
position
is
only
that
claims
that
were
not
prosecuted
within
the
time
--
limitations
in
the
statute
are
not
valid
claims
we
cannot
be
paid.
and
i
point
out,
by
stressing
this
connection
that
the
issue
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
the
underlined
issue
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
don't
--
we
would
not
agree
that
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
question
but
we
would
not
agree
that
there
was
any
purpose
to
pay
untimely
claims.
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
in
the
act
and
we
assumed
that
it
must
be
complied
with.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
and
again
i
stress,
not
only
in
this
1958
letter
which
was
sent
to
all
of
these
claimants
and
to
counsel
for
those
who
had
counsel.
but
again,
in
1961
when
the
final
schedule
was
mailed
to
everybody,
to
all
of
these
claimants.
it
in
--
this
is
a
one
page
letter,
this
at
page
34
of
the
record
which
stated
explicitly,
that
anyone
who
deemed
himself
agreed
by
the
final
schedule
had
60
days
within
which
to
bring
suit
and
the
class
here
involved
individuals
whose
claims
did
not
appear
on
the
schedule
because
they
had
not
submitted
the
original
certificates.
new
per
--
had
--
we're
given
adequate
notice,
ample
notice
that
they
had
60
days
in
which
to
sue.
why
didn't
sue,
we
don't
know?
many
others
similarly
situated,
this
other
class
of
1,800
did.
my
only
point
is
that
their
failure
to
sue
promptly
cannot
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
government
had
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct
and
i
will
just
stress
in
reply
to
that
as
i
said
earlier
that
it
has
never
been
suggested
that
the
alien
property
office
treated
these
claimants
or
japanese-americans
generally,
any
differently,
from
any
corporate
or
other
individuals
having
claims
under
section
34
(f).
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
the
ultimate
outcome.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
and
there's
an
additional
answer
to
that
and
that
is
that
when
the
government
settled
with
the
original
group
of
plaintiffs.
it
was
on
the
understanding
that
this
would
wind
up
the
account
and
leave
a
surplus
for
the
war
claims
fund.
has
the
government
not
relied
on
the
60
days
statute
of
limitations
as
excluding
any
possibility,
any
further
liability
on
the
account
it
might
not
have
settled
or
it
might
have
settled
on
different
terms.
and
this
underlines
the
practical
importance
in
this
situation
of
having
a
rigid
date,
a
bar
date
after
which
the
office
can
with
confidence
wind
up
the
account
and
distribute
it
among
the
various
beneficiaries.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
--
i'm
not
sure
i
wholly
understand
but
the
individuals
who
are
represented
here
are
people
who
did
not
submit
the
original
certificate.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
to
say
they
did
not
prosecute
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
their
administrative
remedy.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
34
(d)
--
the
--
this
--
its
34
(e),
this
--
the
provision
which
relates
to
none
(inaudible)
--
to
solvent
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
death
claims
provides
for
suit
within
60
days
after
the
--
a
custodian
has
mailed
his
determination
to
the
claimant.
the
only
difference
in
terms
of
the
statute
of
limitations
between
the
two
provisions
has
been
in
the
case
of
the
insolvent
fund.
the
statute
doesn't
run
until
the
custodian
has
brought
up
his
final
schedule
showing
all
(voice

--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
no
suit
can
be
prosecuted
except
in
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
your
honors,
it's
the
kind
of
problem
that
arises
customably
in
the
government.
an
example
would
be
a
claim
under
the
social
security
act.
if
you
file
a
claim
with
the
social
security
administration
and
there
legal
counsel
makes
a
determination
that
you're
not
entitled
to
be
paid,
they
will
send
you
a
letter
saying,
i'm
sorry.
we
can't
pay
you
under
our
view
of
the
law.
now,
then
you
have
60
days
there
as
here
to
go
into
court
and
challenge
that
determination
as
arbitrary
or
as
unlawful.
now
very
frequently,
when
the
government
is
sued
like
any
litigant,
like
any
defendant
act
as
the
matter
proceeds
through
the
courts.
the
government
assesses
its
chances
of
victory
in
terms
of
offers
per
settlements
that
are
made
and
very
frequently
compromise
this
case
just
like
other
litigants.
when
it
does
so
like
any
other
litigant,
the
government
does
not
necessarily
either
capitulate,
here
it
didn't
capitulate
that
it
paid
only
half
of
the
--
a
man's
claimed
and
nor
does
it
acknowledge
that
from
the
very
outset
it
had
made
an
error
and
acted
arbitrarily.
as
a
matter
fact
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
there
is
no
--
it
did
not.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
absolutely
not.
the
government
had
prevailed
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
a
very
technical
issue
having
to
do
with
the
rule
of
--
with
the
application
of
the
duetsche
bank
opinion.
there
was
room
for
a
court
to
go
either
way
and
the
government
felt
that
while
victory
wasn't
assured
for.
on
the
other
hand,
neither
was
defeat
and
therefore
did
not
simply
pay
these
people
what
they
were
asking
and
capitulate.
it
bargained
for
a
--
what
seemed
like
a
fair
50-50
settlement.
the
government
has
never
acknowledged
and
does
not
acknowledge
now
that
the
alien
property
office
was
wrong.
let
alone
arbitrary
in
its
determination
that
the
post
war
rate
had
to
apply
because
the
certificate
on
its
face
said
that
this
was
an
obligation
payable
in
yen
in
japan.
it
is
--
and
it
is
not
a
case
where
a
misrepresentation
was
made
that
it
was
ever
suggested
to
these
individuals
that
the
government
absolutely
would
not
pay
except
at
this
low
rate.
of
course
the
possibility
remained
open
and
it
was
alluded
to
in
the
very
first
letter
that
the
courts
would
compel
the
government
to
pay
more
or
that
in
the
event
of
the
--
a
judicial
attack,
the
government
as
a
matter
of
prudence
and
good
executive
management
would
compromise
before
a
final
judgment.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice,
when
we
--
when
the
government
compromise
this
case
after
certiorari
was
granted
we
didn't
--
it
was
not
done
because
the
government
felt
that
the
granting
of
certiorari
was
tantamount
to
a
reversal
of
the
decisions
below.
but
because
a
settlement
offer
was
made
and
the
settlement
offer
seem
reasonable
under
circumstances
but
the
effect
of
this
settlement
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
because
the
department
was
afraid
that
the
supreme
court
might
not
agree
with
its
feel
of
the
law
as
happens
many
times.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
i
think
not.
i
think
the
fact
of
compromise
is
not
a
repudiation
of
the
litigant's
original
position.
it
is
not
a
confession
of
error
nor
did
the
settlement
i
might
add
prejudice
the
individuals
here.
as
far
as
the
legal
issues
are
concern,
it
seems
to
me
they
would
be
identical
if
the
case
had
proceeded
to
a
final
judgment
and
they
had
received
their
--
all
their
money.
we
would
still
be
arguing
that
the
present
claims
were
time
barred.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
think
it
would
have
change
the
facts
because
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
would
have
to
venture
the
view
that
it
could
not
because
the
--
this
court's
adjudication
would
have
affected
only
those
claimants
who
had
sued
within
the
60-day
period.
and
it
could
not
--
an
appeal
taken
by
one
group
of
or
a
litigation
on
behalf
of
one
class
that
does
not
--
and
knew
it
to
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
unfortunately
slept
on
their
rights.
