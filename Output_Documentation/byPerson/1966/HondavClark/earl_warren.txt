suppose
some
of

had
been

would
your

be

chief

mr.
posner,
i
understood
that
mr.
rauh
to
say
that
the
--
while
some
of
these
people
were
represented
by
him
that
the
vast
majority
of
them
were
very
small
certificate
holders
and
were
not
represented
by
anyone.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
were
they
represented
by
lawyers
and
that
--
have
a
legal
advice
available
to
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
posner,
how
much
was
paid
out
by
the
government
and
how
much
was
left
of
the
--
after
they
trade
it
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much?
chief
justice
earl
warren
$11
million
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
these
claims
amounted
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
expense
--
does
the
government
tend
to
do
that
at
the
expense
of
people
whose
property
was
taken
if
the
fund
is
big
enough
to
repay
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
these
valid
claims?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
any
reason
other
than
the
statute
of
limitations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
go
a
little
deeper
than
that.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
directing
that
these
people
be
reimbursed?
was
it
to
the
extent
of
the
funds
available?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
was
it
to
get
by
as
cheaply
as
it
could
so
it
could
put
money
into
the
warfront?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
general
purpose
however
was
that
if
the
fund
was
large
enough
that
it
should
be
used
to
reimburse
in
full
those
people
whose
property
have
been
taken,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
pay
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
i
--
i
didn't
ask
that.
i'm
talking
about
the
general
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
do
equity
whether
--
its
not
to
these
people
whose
property
had
been
taken
during
the
war
and
who
through
war
had
no
right
to
regain
their
property
and
that
it
should
be
done
on
equitable
terms
after
the
matter
had
been
processed
by
the
proper
united
states
agencies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
would
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
make
no
point
of
it
then
that
we
are
--
that
if
you
were
not
to
prevail
that
this
is
depriving
the
war
fund
that
you
spoke
of,
the
money
that
it's
just
entitled
to
--
under
the
--
according
to
the
intention
of
congress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
posner,
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
the
reason
for
the
government
telling
these
people
that
2%
--
they
must
give
them
only
2%
and
then
thereafter
settled
for
25
or
50
times
that
much
with
the
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
with
the
others.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
did
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
it
make
the
settle
because
it
thought
it
had
acted
arbitrarily?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
there
a
difference
between
this
and
the
instance
you
raised
here,
it
isn't
the
question
as
to
whether
the
claim
is
just
in
amount.
it's
a
question
of
what
you
should
do
and
must
do
under
the
law,
and
you
told
these
people
that
you
must
pay
them
only
2%
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
you'd
won
all
the
way
to
say
in
the
lower
courts,
i
didn't
know
the
mere
granting
of
search
in
the
case
because
the
government
do
change
its
positions
radically
as
it
did
--
we
didn't
hear
when
it
operates
to
the
--
with
the
detriments
of
a
lot
of
other
people
who
are
equally
entitled
to
such
amount
of
money.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
it
be
reasonable
if
as
a
matter
of
law
the
department
felt
that
it
could
not
pay
more
than
2%?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
were
back
to
the
(inaudible)
[laughter].
we're
back
in
the
circle,
aren't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
you
might
have
been
in
a
different
legal
position
in
this
case,
if
you
had
lost
the
other
case
and
this
court
had
held
that
your
--
they
were
entitled
to
a
100%?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said
it
might?
chief
justice
