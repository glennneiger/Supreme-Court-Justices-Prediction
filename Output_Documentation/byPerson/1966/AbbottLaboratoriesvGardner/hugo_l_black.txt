what
do
you
mean
precisely
about
rightness?
justice

black
do
you
put
that
together
with
having
the
same
meaning,
hypothetical
or
future
those
words
have
the

meaning?
justice

l.
black
i
thought
you
used
them
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
take
this
case
as
alleging
that
at
this
stage
now
that
this
is
permitted
to
go
on,
at
this
stage
he
is
already
liable
to
suffer
irreparable
injury
or
that
that's
not
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it's
true?
justice
hugo

black
and
that
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
make
him
suffer
irreparable
injury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
he
doesn't
have
to
make
any
preparation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
be
prosecuted
criminally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why?
don't
they
not
have
a
right
to
consider
it?
justice

black
what
we
theoretically
might
occur
if
that's
the
law.
justice
hugo

black
and
they
went?
justice

black
and
they
went?
justice
hugo

black
they
went
into
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
happened
to
win,
supposed
they
hadn't
won?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
they
had
made
a
mistake
in
not
trying
to
stop
it
before,
wouldn't
they?
justice

l.
black
well,
they
could
of
course
under
the
young
doctrine
if
they
had
gone
that
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
don't
have
to
do
that,
do
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
your
objection
then
that
they
could
file
proper
cause
at
this
juncture,
under
some
circumstances
to
get
the
relief
they
asked
but
that
the
facts
here
led
--
were
not
sufficient,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
the
allegation
was
that
they
adopted
this
and
they
did
raise
a
present
controversy
because
they
claim,
may
not
be
equal
to
the
young
ex
parte,
young
allegations.
but
they
claim
to
something
approaching
ex
parte
young
allegations,
do
they
not?
justice

black
i
said
--
justice
hugo

black
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
him
to
charge
or
maybe
not
that
they
do
hit
them
now
and
that
there
will
be
such
tremendous
expenses
and
such
tremendous
change
and
such
tremendous
differences
that
will
work
irreparable
harm.
and
if
ex
parte
young
does
grant
relief
under
those
circumstances
why
isn't
a
question
not
formed
–
a
question
of
degree,
if
they
reached
that
degree
which
young
says
would
make
a
good
change?
justice

would
you
not
--
justice

black
--
take
the
position
that
is
impossible
for
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
the
present
situation
to
file
a
good
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
attack
this?
justice

black
or
there
is
always
in
effect
criminal
offense
and
they
could
be
put
in
jail
if
they
violate
it.

what's

justice

what's
the

now,
that

could
do
something
to
stop
them
from

a

of
prosecution,
i
thought

number

is
that

have
they
alleged
that
here?
justice

black
they
did
not?
justice

do
you
disclaim

to

and
as
i
understand
it
what
they're
complaining
about
is
that
it
entered

you're
saying
that

that
