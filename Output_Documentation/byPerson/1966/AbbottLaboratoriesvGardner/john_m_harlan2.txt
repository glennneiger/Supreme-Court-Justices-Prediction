justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
of
course
if
you're
right
on
that
statutory
argument,
that
ends
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
not
suppose
anybody
would
question
you,
it
will
be
right
to
--
if
there
isn't
a
jurisdictional
review
at
this
stage.
but
apart
from
that,
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
of
rightness,
(inaudible)
for
your
time
too
--
is
this
case
more
or
less
right
than
one
with
the
broadcasting
or
frozen
food
or
storer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
less
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
always
it
is
clear
that
the
legislative
history
i
thought
now
that
the
briefs
is
quite
a
scrap,
(inaudible)
no
judicial
review
and
broad
judicial
review
unless
it's
compromised.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
do
you
have
a
broad
reservation
in
the
acts
of
doing
that?
