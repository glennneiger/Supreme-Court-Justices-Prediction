justice

fortas
reprehensible,
mr.
gessell?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
--
how
do
you
draw
the
line
mr.
gessell
between
administrative
actions
that
are
reviewable
on
injunction
and
administrative
actions
where
you
have
to
wait
until
summing
--
the
actions
taken
by
the
agency,
what's
the
--
how
would
you
define
it
as
theoretical
or
general
manner?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
apply
it
only
in
the
cases
where
there
has
been
rule
making?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
go
to
another
field.
let's
suppose
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
adopts
a
rule
that
affects
the
securities
industry
or
rule
let's
say
regulating
brokers
in
some
way
or
other,
is
it
your
theory
that
when
that
rule
making
process
is
completed,
the
brokers
may
bring
an
injunctive
action
and
that
the
court
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
that
and
that
the
brokerage
companies
have
standing
to
maintain
it
and
that
the
controversy
is
right
without
waiting
for
the
sec
to
take
action
against
a
particular
company?
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
is
now
--
that
is
a
novel
position
--
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
an
administrative
law?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
tell
me
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
tell
me
what
supports
it?
i
mean
to
say,
isn't
that
contrary
to
the
assumptions
on
which
lawyers
in
courts
and
legislatures
have
here
before
proceeded
in
the
field
of
administrative
law?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
now,
let's
--
let
me
take
this
with
you
again
looking
forward
and
you're
thinking
of
all
many
of
those
cases.
but
i
suppose
that
when
you
come
to
test,
let's
suppose
that
to
get
in
the
proceeding
on
the
merits
here,
you
get
beyond
the
purely
semantic
question
of
whether
on
its
face
the
statute
supported
what
the
commission
had
did
here,
and
you
get
to
a
question
of
reasonableness,
and
that
is
raised
by
your
complaint
here,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
or
do
you
mean
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
want
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
raise
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation?
i
thought
you
did.
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
not
asking
what
you
consider,
do
you
so
allege?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
in
order
to
evaluate
that
allegation,
wouldn't
it
be
necessary
to
consider
the
specific
impact
of
the
regulation
upon
specific
products
and
specific
industry
problems
and
may
--
may
not
that
be
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
cases
to
which
you
referred?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
commissioner
concedes
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
this
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
kind
of
extraordinary
isn't
it
that
commissioner
would
concede
that
his
own
regulation
is
confusing?
justice
abe
fortas
these
are
the
same
remedies
that
are
applicable
generally
under
the
food
and
drug
act
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
are
they
not?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
has
there
been
a
successful
injunction
suit
under
the
other
applications
of
those
remedies
under
food
and
drug
act
in
a
decision
of
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
supporting
an
injunction
brought
by
drug
company
against
the
provisions
under
other
parts
of
food
and
drug
act?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
talking
of
--
as
i
remember
that
--
then,
let
me
ask
you
this
i
have
forgotten.
does
food
and
drug
administration
have
a
rule
making
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
deleterious
substances
in
drugs?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
and
they
have
issued
rules,
have
they
not?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
there
any
precedent
for
an
injunctive
proceeding
brought
by
a
drug
company
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
those
rules?
justice
abe
fortas
and
those
remedies
being
the
same
as
the
remedies
here,
is
that
right?
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
say
seizure?
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
injunction
or
criminal
prosecution?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
now,
is
there
any
way
--
the
question
i
was
trying
to
get
at
with
mr.
gessell
is
this,
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
injunctive
remedy
is
available
in
the
present
case,
would
it
also
follow
or
would
it
not
that
an
injunctive
remedy
is
available
in
other
cases
under
the
food
and
drug
administration.
for
example,
suppose
food
and
drug
administration
decides
that
the
inclusion
of
certain
type
of
ingredient
and
the
certain
type
of
drug
may
result
in
great
injury
to
the
population,
maybe
poisonous
or
cause
all
sorts
of
damage.
and
somebody
brings
an
injunctions
suit
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
that,
is
that
case
the
same
as
the
case
we
have
before
us
or
is
it
different?
if
we
hold
in
the
present
case
that
an
injunctive
proceeding
lies,
does
it
follow
that
where
food
and
drug
says
you
cannot
get
out
a
drug
and
call
it
so
and
so
if
it
contains
such
and
such
an
ingredient,
that
injunctive
proceeding
wouldn't
be
in
that
case,
we're
just
trying
perhaps
not
very
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
i
have
asked
with
mr.
gessell.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lewin,
are
there
in
this
record
the
labels
of
drugs
that
would
be
affected
here?
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
in
this
record
copies
of
advertisements
that
would
be
affected
here?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
is
it
fair
to
say
that
in
the
sense
what
is
being
--
what
petitioners
are
seeking
to
have
the
court's
rule
on
is
a
there's
a
question
which
can
i
use
this
without
invading
his
abstract
in
the
sense
that
they're
asking
us
to
rule
that
the
secretary's
construction
of
the
statute
is
unjustified
as
an
abstract
matter
and
that
we
allow
--
we
do
no
take
into
account
whether
in
view
of
actual
examples,
actual
factual
record,
the
construction
--
the
secretary's
construction
of
the
statute
as
within
the
area
of
rational
judgment
that
some
people
urge
is
a
factor
in
construing
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
of
delegated
power.
justice
abe
fortas
and,
mr.
lewin,
is
it
fair
--
is
it
fair
to
say
that
that
is
the
underlying
idea
of
the
food
and
drug
act
and
that
the
act
has
somewhere
in
some
respects
a
peculiar
place
in
our
regulatory
system,
that
is
to
say
i
don't
know
of
hand
of
any
other
statute
that
has
--
this
prompt
seizure
power
(inaudible),
but
isn't
that
bound
in
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
dealing
with
in
their
old
days
that
was
justified
on
the
grounds
you
were
dealing
with
dangerous
drugs.
and
they
proved
that
it
might
be
dangerous.
and
you
do
now
have
extra
ordinary
procedures
here
because
of
that,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
if
they
do
that
now,
won't
they
mr.
gessell,
with
all
kinds
of
regulations
and
rulings
you're
going
there
with
the
food
and
drug
with
the
new
drug
application,
then
you've
got
to
go
through
the
varying
process
of
getting
a
clearance
on
that
but
so
far
as
i
know,
nobody
is
ever
here
before
succeeded
in
getting
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
class
of
regulations.
now
maybe
there's
something
in
the
legislative
history
here
or
the
legislation
itself
that
makes
this
a
special
case.
but
i
have
two
questions
if
so
what
is
it
and
the
second
question
is
if
we
rule
here
that
in
this
situation,
an
injunction
proceeding
can
be
maintained,
does
it
or
does
it
not
follow
that
we're
giving
the
drug
companies
or
anybody
else
who
maybe
affected
an
injunctive
remedy
in
cases
where
for
example,
food
and
drug
administration
says
that
you
cannot
market
such
and
such
a
drug
unless
you
show
on
the
label
and
under
certain
uses
it's
poisonous
to
people.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
is
this
different?
that's
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
it
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
an
adversary,
evidentiary
hearing
generally
in
food
and
drug.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
the
legislative
hearing.
justice
abe
fortas
the
legislation
had
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
reprehensible,
mr.
gessell?
justice

what
do
you

how
do

draw
