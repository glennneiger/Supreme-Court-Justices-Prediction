justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gessell,
i
take
it
that
there's
no
question
with
what
--
even
if
you
lose
this
case,
but
you
can
get
judicial
review
to
the
validity
of
this
regulation
under
the
statute,
just
a
question
of
when
i
take
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
be
making
--
you'd
still
be
here
and
making
the
same
argument
that
there
were
no
criminal
enforcement
procedures?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
would
be
here
now
--
or
in
this
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
have
the
--
they
haven't
done
that
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
explain
the
congress
saying
you
may
have
pre-enforcement
review
in
regulations
under
a,
b,
c,
and
d
or
whatever
it
was
and
one
of
the
statutes
listed
is
not
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
they
didn't
need
those
provisions
at
all
if
you
could
get
to
the
general
matter,
it
has
to
be
enforcement
review.
this
would
mean,
we
needed
that
to
specify
that
the
enforcement
review
could
be
had,
and
if
that
was
a
general
matter
--
it
was
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe,
i
don't
know
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
remember
the
specific
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
congress
did
say
that
there
could
be
pre-enforcement
review
upon
any
sort
of
the
regulation
under
a
certain
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
direct
--
direct
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
without
that
provision
in
the
act,
do
you
say
that
--
that
under
those
sections
you
could
go
right
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
the
case
or
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

district
court
in
its
declaratory
judgment
action
could
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
not
to
entertain.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
i
assume
that
it's
the
revision,
but
the
congress
didn't
intend
to
have
this
kind
of
an
action
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whether
it's
a
case
of
controversy
or
whether
it's
right
or
anything
of
that
kind.
congress,
you
say,
has
pre-empted
this
kind
of
a
case
by
its
own
procedures.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
lewin,
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lewin,
i
think
if
the
petitioners
argue
that
the
congress
specified
certain
pre-enforcement
action
should
take
place
in
the
--
pre-enforcement
review
action
to
take
place
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
except
that
for
those
all
other
pre-enforcement
procedures,
or
actions,
or
review
should
be
in
the
district
court,
and
you
argue
that
the
congressional
selection
of
few
to
go
into
court
of
appeals
and
meant
to
work
to
be
in
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
the
initial
suggestion
was
that
these
specified
pre-enforcement
reviews
action
should
be
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
argument
as
i
take
is
that
if
there
was
general
pre-enforcement
review
procedures
available
in
the
district
court,
the
congress
didn't
need
to
do
anything
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
they
wanted
to
expedite
certain
ones
of
it?
justice
byron
r.

that
there's
no
