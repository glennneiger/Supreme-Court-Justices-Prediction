mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
and
the
one
immediately
following
it,
the
company
subject
to
regulation
under
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
have
brought
actions
in
district
courts
the
challenge
formal
a
regulation
issued
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
which
construe
or
interpret
various
terms
of
reason
amendments
for
that
act.
in
neither
of
the
cases
has
the
food
and
drug
administration
or
the
attorney
general
apply
any
of
the
challenge
constructions
in
any
concrete
manner
to
any
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
in
neither
instance,
have
any
of
the
three
remedies
authorized
by
the
act,
seizure
of
misbranded
or
adulterated
goods,
injunction
against
their
future
distribution,
or
criminal
prosecution
been
instituted
by
the
attorney
general
against
any
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
plaintiffs
in
both
cases
contend
however
that
since
the
regulations
reflected
the
considered
views
of
the
agency
and
since
obedience
to
these
regulations
would
require
them
to
change
their
way
of
doing
business
in
some
fashion,
they
are
entitled
to
bring
actions
at
this
juncture
to
determine
whether
the
regulations
are
valid.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
only
--
the
only
thing
i'm
referring
to
mr.
justice
stewart
is
just
that
this
is
not
a
total
revolutionary
change
in
the
way,
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
a
very
precise
change
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
that
is
very
precise.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
but
it
--
all
that
i'm
referring
to
is
just
that
they're
not
--
they're
not
put
out
of
business.
they're
not
--
they
don't
suffer
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
i
hope
that
--
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
no,
but
i
think,
i
think
one
of
the
--
and
i
hope
to
elaborate
on
this,
at
a
later
portion
of
my
argument,
one
of
the
factors
i
think
going
to
whether
the
case
is
right
at
this
juncture
mr.
justice
stewart
is
precisely
whether
the
harm
that
caused
by
refusing
to
obey
and
by
challenging
this
regulation
at
a
later
point
rather
at
the
present
point
whether
that
is
an
irreparable
harm
or
whether
it's
just
a
matter
of
challenging
later
rather
than
now.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
that's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
issue
of
rightness
which
is
common
about
these
cases
is
one,
which
is
this
court
noted
well
ago
in
the
rochester
telephone
case
in
327
u.s.
is
not
limited
to
administrative
regulations
or
administrative
law
problems
but
applies
across
the
board
to
a
variety
of
instances
in
which
statutes
maybe
construed.
let
me
turn
first
then
to
these
generally
applicable
principles
of
rightness
in
the
context
of
this
case.
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
whether,
mr.
justice
black,
whether
the
issue
presented
the
legal
issue
which
is
presented
for
decision
by
the
court
is
appropriate
to
be
heard
now
or
at
some
point
when
it's
more
definite
and
certain
who
is
hurt
and
how
they're
hurt.
we
submit
that
this
court
has
held
in
a
variety
of
instances
and
properly
so
that
hypothetical
or
future
harms
to
a
person
or
to
a
--
to
a
plaintiff
in
any
suit
are
not
the
stuff
of
which
adjudication
is
made
and
that
it's
appropriate
ordinarily
to
wait
until
a
party
is
individually
and
specifically
harmed
in
some
definite
manner
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
no,
we
think
they're
quite
different.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
think
they're
quite
different
but
we
think
they're
both
--
both
elements
that
enter
into
this
question.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
in
the
--
in
maybe
in
a
broad
sense
of
what
case
or
controversy
means.
of
course
this
court
has
at
times
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
used
to
term
case
or
controversy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
--that's
established
law
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
certainly.
but
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that
mr.
justice
white,
that
court
generally
exercise
their
discretion
when
cases
are
not
exercised
at
discretion.
but
they
do
not
entertain
premature
suits.
they
do
not
entertain
actions
which
although
there
is
according
to
the
plaintiff's
complaint
a
present
difference
with
the
government
agency
or
with
the
defendant
nonetheless
a
plaintiff
is
not
adequately
harmed
at
just
that
precise
time
and
will
be
able
to
challenge
the
regulation
in
the
future.
i
think
that's
a
key
element
here,
that
there
is
really
nobody
is
suggesting,
and
mr.
gessell
as
at
various
times
adverted
to
improper
or
suggested
that
there's
some
impropriety
in
the
government
putting
off
the
decision
in
this
case.
now,
of
course
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
this
regulation
will
never
be
tested.
the
only
question
is
whether
it
should
be
tested
now
or
in
a
particular
suit
involving
a
particular
label
in
which
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
the
attorney
general
determined
that
under
the
food
and
drug
administration's
construction
of
this
act,
that
label
violates
the
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
he
is
alleging
that
he
is
going
to
be
suffering
irreparable
injury
but
he's
focusing
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
--
we
think
he's
focusing
on
the
wrong
thing
mr.
justice
black.
he's
saying
he
suffers
irreparable
injury
if
he
obeys
the
regulation.
the
real
question
is
does
he
suffer
irreparable
injury
if
he
waits
until
that
later
action
when
he
can
challenge
the
regulation.
and
we
say
he
does
not
suffer
irreparable
injury
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
ordinary
rightness
decisions
if
he
waits
until
later.
in
other
words,
there's
no
question
mr.
justice
black
that
if
he
listens
to
this
regulation
and
he
follows
it
that
he
will
have
to
change
the
label
he
is
now
using.
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
but
the
real
issue
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
but
the
real
issue
is
not,
that
injury,
the
real
issue
mr.
justice
black
is
whether
if
he
waits
until
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
the
attorney
general
proceed
against
him
will
he
because
of
waiting
before
to
suffer
some
irreparable
injury
and
our
point
is
that
the
delay
doesn't
cause
them
any
injury
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
other
than
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
have
to
change
his
labels
today
if
he
in
good
faith
believes
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
an
error
in
its
construction
of
the
statute,
then
he
continues
to
use
his
own
labels
in
labeling.
mr.
nathan
lewin
theoretically,
they
could
be
prosecuted
criminally
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
because
we
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
true.
but
we
think
that
danger
of
being
prosecuted
criminally
is
precisely
the
kind
of
injury
that
any
person
who
is
theoretically
subject
to
a
criminal
statute
can
allege.
a
very
perfect
recent
instance
we
think
mr.
justice
black
is
what
this
court
did
has
done
in
the
travel
to
cuba
regulations.
in
zemel
and
rusk,
the
plaintiff
in
that
suit
brought
an
action
against
the
secretary
of
state
seeking
to
have
--
the
travel
to
cuba
restriction
declared
not
only
invalid
in
the
sense
that
he
wanted
to
have
his
passport
validated
to
cuba,
but
also
seeking
ruling
from
the
court,
a
declaratory
judgment
that
would
it
would
not
violate
section
215,
the
immigration
nationality
act
for
him
to
travel
to
cuba.
this
court
very
clearly
held
that
it
was
premature
to
consider
that
challenge
to
the
criminal
statute
at
that
point
although
he
was
subject
to
the
harm
of
criminal
prosecution
if
he
then
traveled
to
cuba
which
he
had
every
intention
according
to
him
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
there's
intention
of
doing.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
went
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
they
hadn't
won
then
--
then
that
--
and
then
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
in
that
case
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
that
indicates
why
they
should
not
be
able
to
stop
it
before
because
if
they're
wrong
they
should
not
be
able
to
--
this
court
held
that
they
could
not
in
advance
of
their
committing
their
criminal
act
obtained
from
a
court
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
statute
as
officially
construed
by
the
department
of
state
would
apply
to
their
conduct.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
yes.
yes,
when
--
we
--
there's
no
claim
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
remedies
are
two
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
is
seizure
or
injunction,
the
attorney
general
on
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
seizure
in
chaos
(ph)
in
any
case
of
misbranding,
seizing
a
shipment
or
whatever
product,
a
carton
of
the
goods
and
having
a
suit,
a
viable
action
then
in
the
district
court
in
which
the
attorney
general
is
required
to
establish
that
the
drugs
are
misbranded
and
therefore
subject
to
seizure.
now,
they
would
not
be
mr.
gessell
spoke
of
multiple
seizures.
multiple
seizures
are
not
authorized
in
these
circumstances.
multiple
seizures
are
authorized
under
the
statute
only
when
the
drug
that's
being
sold
is
hazardous
or
dangerous
to
health
in
some
way.
when
the
only
misbranding
that's
involved
is
a
violation
of
this
kind
of
a
statute
or
as
construed
by
the
regulation,
there
is
no
authority
from
multiple
seizures.
so
the
only
possibility
here
on
the
civil
side
and
it's
been
the
consistent
practice
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
apply
civil
remedies
when
there
are
litigable
issues
of
construction
of
a
statute
of
this
kind.
the
only
remedies
would
be
seizure
or
injunction.
now,
those
are
precisely
the
remedies
--
they
don't
have
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
not
by
a
drug
company.
in
other
words,
these
remedies
would
be
by
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
none.
none.
those
rules
ordinarily
would
be
subject
to
the
specific
remedies
outlined
in
the
act.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
when
the
food
and
drug
administration
believes
that
a
drug
company
is
violating
the
act,
it
has
those
remedies.
a
drug
company
subject
to
an
order
which
is
of
the
legislative
congress
before,
and
the
one
specifically
enumerated
in
the
statute
where
there
is
delegated
to
the
food
and
drug
administration,
the
power
to
promulgate
regulation
regarding
deleterious
substances,
ordinarily
has
review
by
way
of
the
specific
remedy
provided
in
the
statute
which
is
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
i
understand
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
rationale,
i
think
it
would
have
to
apply
in
that
case
although
in
your
circumstances
mr.
justice
fortas
there
are
other
remedies
provide
in
the
statute
in
which
a
drug
company
can
review
but
i
think
that
precisely
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that's
precisely
our
main
ground
of
objection
here
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
food
and
drug
administration
would
be
delighted
to
have
an
authoritative
determination
of
--
by
a
court
of
--
at
least
the
validity
of
this
regulation.
and
it
turns
out
in
this
case
that
such
a
determination
in
this
particular
suit
would
affect
and
buying
most
of
the
large
drug
companies
in
the
united
states
and
would
authoritatively
settle
the
every
time
question.
the
real
problem
though
is
what
a
holding
of
this
kind
opens
the
doors
to
because
if
this
suit
can
be
brought
in
this
case
by
27
of
the
large
drug
companies
in
the
united
states,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
suit
being
brought
tomorrow
by
any
one
of
those
drug
companies
against
any
other
regulation
of
the
federal
--
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
indeed,
against
any
other
interpretative
regulation
or
indeed
against
even
another
clause
in
this
very
regulation.
this
regulation
was
issued
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
as
part
of
a
whole
sequence
of
regulations
administering
the
drug
amendments
of
1962.
drug
companies
were
given
the
opportunity
to
provide
to
supply
written
comments
to
those
proposed
regulations.
they
objected
not
merely
that
every
time
regulation
but
they
objected
also
to
the
requirement
in
this
regulation
that
the
generic
name
appear
in
conjunction
with
the
brand
name
that
it
appear
in
brackets
or
parenthesis.
now,
they
are
not
involved
in
the
suit,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
this
suit
can
be
maintained
is
absolutely
nothing
to
stop
any
one
of
these
drug
companies
from
bringing
another
suit
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
to
declare
that
provision
unjustified,
impermissible
under
the
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
there
are
none.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
now,
that's
precisely
our
principal
objection
to
what
their
claim
is.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
they
could
if
the
food
and
drug
administration
did
something
to
any
one
of
them
that
in
any
way
raised
a
present
controversy.
there
were
other
remedies
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
nothing
that
--
that
harms
any
one
of
them
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
in
such
a
way
that
they
would
not
be
harmed
if
they
waited
until
something
happened
to
them.
in
other
words,
nothing
has
really
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
there
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
is
a
question
of
degree
definitely
mr.
justice
black
but
we
think
that
the
allegations
here
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
in
the
circumstance.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
to
attack
this
regulation
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
without
--
yes,
without
the
food
and
drug
administration
doing
anything
more
or
the
attorney
general
doing
anything
more,
we
think
they
could
not
present
the
challenge
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right
and
that's
true
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
of
every
criminal
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
it's
true
of
every
criminal
statute
mr.
justice
black
that
if
you
violate
it
you
may
be
put
in
jail
and
that's
doesn't
entitle
you
to
go
to
court
and
say
may
i
now
violate
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
because
i
propose
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
it
makes
you
today.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
--
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
held
really
in
the
--
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
statute
that
you
can
do
that,
even
if
you
--
even
if
you
could
show
you
are
a
repeated
offender
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
i
think
where
--
the
only
claim
is
that
the
party
responsible
for
administering
the
criminal
statute
is
construing
it,
it's
applicable
to
my
case
whereas
really
it
shouldn't
–
it's
certainly
true
where
there
are
criminal
statutes
which
in
someway
affect
a
constitutional
right
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
they
do.
there's
no
claim
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
they
applied
for
example
with
a
new
drug
or
with
an
antibiotic
for
certification.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
i
have
no
--
our
objection
--
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
what
mr.
justice
fortas
was
suggesting
was
something
what
that
went
to
the
--
to
the
drafting
of
the
complaint.
our
objection
is
not
that
the
complaint
was
improperly
drafted
or
failed
to
allege
something
--
it's
just
that
nothing
had
happened
yet.
the
food
and
drug
administration
or
the
attorney
general
has
not
really
brought
this
regulation
to
the
point
where
any
one
of
these
plaintiffs
is
being
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
say
we
will
not
until
the
regulation
--
until
the
validity
of
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
regulation
has
been
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
disclaim
a
purpose
to
prosecute
in
the
sense
of
criminal
prosecution,
yes.
we
say
though
that
we
will
have
this
regulation
tested
either
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
either
civil
forfeitures
or
through
the
new
drug
clearance
procedures
provided
for
under
the
act
which
any
one
of
these
companies
can
submit
a
new
drug
or
an
antibiotic
for
certification,
refused
to
have
it
labeled
in
accordance
with
this
regulation
and
then
appeal
from
the
refusal
of
food
and
drug
administration
to
certify
the
antibiotic
or
to
approve
a
new
drug
for
sale,
appeal
from
that
under
the
procedures
in
the
food
and
drug
act
which
authorize
to
review
directly
in
a
court
of
appeals.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
i
was
just
coming
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
that
irrespective
of
the
questions
of
rightness
that
apply
generally
and
would
apply
to
none
and
to
actions
not
affecting
administrative
agency,
in
this
case,
the
food
and
drug
act,
both
congress
and
this
court
have
recognized
that
suits
of
this
kind
brought
out
of
the
usual
course,
prematurely
will
do
serious
harm
to
the
administration
of
an
act
which
had
a
substantial,
remedial
impact
on
the
nation's
consumers
in
this
entire
area.
in
mytinger
and
casselberry
in
339,
u.s.,
this
court
specifically
noted
that
really
are
held
that
in
a
case
which
was
far
more
right
really
than
this
one
in
the
sense
that
they
were
really
two
adversaries
contesting
a
particular
product
at
a
point
in
time
when
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
proceeding
against
that
product.
nonetheless
this
court
held
that
it
would
be
undermining
the
intent
of
congress
under
the
food
and
drug
and
cosmetic
act
to
allow
review
at
that
point.
and
we
think
that
the
entire
legislative
history
of
this
act
demonstrates
as
much
because
there
was
much
tugging
and
pulling
in
congress
before
section
701
(f)
which
provides
the
judicial
review
of
only
very
limited
number
of
orders
was
finally
enacted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right
and
we
think
that
the
--
that
the
fact,
the
review
scheme
that
the
statute
provide
we
think
is
really
exclusive
at
to
these
kinds
of
procedures
the
kind
of
proceeding
is
calculated
to
get
expeditious
resolution
of
this
--
of
these
kind
of
questions
because
if
this
suit
had
not
been
brought
when
it
was
it
would've
been
a
matter
of
weeks
or
months
before
an
application
would
have
been
made
for
a
new
drug
or
would
have
been
passed
on
by
the
food
and
drug
administration,
it
would've
been
up
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
very
regulation
in
all
its
parts
would've
been
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
review.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it's
less
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
less
right
in
those
cases
because
in
both
columbian
broadcasting
and
in
storer,
those
were
the
kind
of
situations
which
we
think
there
was
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
an
irreparable
harm.
there
was
a
fish
or
cut
bait
position
that
the
defendants
in
those
cases
may
have
been
put
in
to,
where
the
people
were
subject
to
those
regulations.
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
hadn't
been
applied.
but
on
the
other
hand
those
particular
individuals
or
plaintiffs
in
those
suits
had
to
make
at
that
point
decisions
which
--repercussions
of
which
would
be
felt
only
later.
in
other
words,
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
for
example,
the
plaintiff
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
case
would
have
to
sever
its
contract
with
the
variety
of
licensees
if
it
was
going
to
obey
that
order.
if
it
was
going
to
wait
until
later
to
test
it,
assuming
then
that
the
time
that
had
lapse
that
they
waited
until
they
actually
felt
the
pinch
of
that
regulation,
they
would
have
irrevocably
loss
certain
options
that
were
opened
to
them
at
that
stage.
i
think
the
clearest
illustration
of
this
is
not
a
case
in
this
court
but
is
in
the
nash-finch
case
which
the
petitioners
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
rely
on.
the
nash-finch
case
in
288
f.2d,
where
the
federal
trade
commission
had
issued
a
regulation
saying,
that
they
construed
the
statute
as
in
effect
of
waiving
all
rights
unless
the
party
sought
review
within
60
days
in
a
court
of
appeals.
now,
if
you
waited
until
you
felt
the
pinch
of
that
regulation,
you
would
lose
your
time
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
in
those
cases,
those
are
the
kinds
of
instances
we
think
with
the
delay
itself
works
the
harm.
in
other
words,
if
delay
really
having
those
questions
reviewed
later
rather
than
now
is
what
causes
harm,
then
we
think
you're
entitled
to
possibly
to
go
in
an
earlier
stage
and
seek
--
and
seek
relief
at
that
stage.
but
if
there's
no
harm
caused
from
the
delay
other
than
possibility
of
seizure
which
this
court
held
in
mytinger
and
casselberry
under
the
food
and
drug
act
was
not
enough
to
give
you
the
right
to
go
in
and
sue
in
advance
even
though
it
might
harm
your
reputation,
then
we
don't
have
a
right
to
go
into
that
stage.
frozen
food
express
presents
a
closer
question
but
we
nonetheless
think
that
in
that
case
because
the
commission
has
enforcement
power
itself
because
there
was
a
separate
statute
authorized
in
review
unlike
--
broadly
of
all
commission
orders,
for
that
reason
we
think
frozen
food
express
might
be
distinguished
from
the
present
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
because
we
are
–
and
we
think
it's
plain
from
the
legislative
history
and
we
try
to
outline
it
in
our
brief
that
what
congress
was
concerned
with
was
the
delay
that
would
be
caused
by
pre-enforcement
judicial
review.
when
congress
moved
--
at
a
very
late
stage,
congress
moved
the
remedies
from
the
district
courts
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
doing
to
expedite
the
enforcement
of
food
and
drug
regulations,
it
would
as
the
contrary
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
and
that
was
amended
at
a
very
late
stage,
put
them
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
purpose
of
that
was
to
expedite
it.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
what
you're
doing
in
the
very
same
breadth
is
opening
the
door
to
a
wide
variety
of
actions
in
the
district
courts,
then
all
you're
doing
is
you're
adding
another
level
of
judicial
review,
you're
slowing
down
the
proceeding,
and
we
think
this
case
and
the
one
that
follows
it
demonstrate
quite
clearly
how
that,
why
that's
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right,
congress
wouldn't
have
any
--
we
think
the
whole
fight
(voice
overlap)
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely.
but
we
think
mr.
justice
harlan
if
you
take
the
reading
of
section
701
(f)
(6)
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
do
and
that
the
second
circuit
did
in
the
toilet
goods
case,
then
that
whole
scrap
becomes
utterly
meaningless
because
congress
in
the
one
hand
was
fighting
really
tooth-and-nail
about
exactly
which
kinds
of
regulations,
you
should
subject
to
review
in
a
specific
review
provision
when
it
was
in
the
other
hand
just
giving
away
or
authorizing
companies
such
as
those
that
are
involved
in
these
two
cases
to
institute
an
action
at
any
time
they
like
in
the
district
court.
that's
in
effect
the
consequence
of
what
a
petitioner's
argument,
that
congress
was
fighting
about
a
specific
review
provision
when
it
was
at
the
same
breadth
intending
to
save
a
broad
range
of
case
and
which
could
always
be
instituted
in
the
district
court
under
declaratory
judgments
act.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
we
think
what
that
was
intended
to
reserve
in
light
of
the
congressional
uncertainty
at
that
time
as
to
what
would
be
available,
that
was
intended
to
preserve
we
think
--
really
the
remedies
--
first
of
all
at
(f)
(6)
mr.
justice
harlan
specifically
refers
to
the
remedy
in
this
subsection.
in
other
words,
saying
that
the
remedy
specifically
provided
for
an
(f)
(1)
are
not
to
derogate
from
any
other
remedies
available.
in
other
words
--
and
we
think
congress
is
referring
only
to
review
of
those
kinds
of
regulations
and
what
congress
was
saying
we
think
is
that
their
90-day-limitations
period
and
all
the
very
specific
provisions
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
not
to
apply
in
cases
where
for
example
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
not
followed
the
procedures
outlined
in
the
prior
subsection
where
for
example,
they
hadn't
given
notice
to
the
parties,
they
hadn't
given
them
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
in
those
kind
of
cases
or
in
substantive
due
process
cases
of
some
kind
it
was
still
permissible
to
go
into
a
district
court
after
the
90-day-period
had
expired
and
bring
an
action.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
and
the
one
immediately
following
it,
the
company
subject
to
regulation
under
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
have
brought
actions
in
district
courts
the
challenge
formal
a
regulation
issued
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
which
construe
or
interpret
various
terms
of
reason
amendments
for
that
act.
in
neither
of
the
cases
has
the
food
and
drug
administration
or
the
attorney
general
apply
any
of
the
challenge
constructions
in
any
concrete
manner
to
any
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
in
neither
instance,
have
any
of
the
three
remedies
authorized
by
the
act,
seizure
of
misbranded
or
adulterated
goods,
injunction
against
their
future
distribution,
or
criminal
prosecution
been
instituted
by
the
attorney
general
against
any
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
plaintiffs
in
both
cases
contend
however
that
since
the
regulations
reflected
the
considered
views
of
the
agency
and
since
obedience
to
these
regulations
would
require
them
to
change
their
way
of
doing
business
in
some
fashion,
they
are
entitled
to
bring
actions
at
this
juncture
to
determine
whether
the
regulations
are
valid.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
only
--
the
only
thing
i'm
referring
to
mr.
justice
stewart
is
just
that
this
is
not
a
total
revolutionary
change
in
the
way,
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
a
very
precise
change
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
that
is
very
precise.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
but
it
--
all
that
i'm
referring
to
is
just
that
they're
not
--
they're
not
put
out
of
business.
they're
not
--
they
don't
suffer
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
i
hope
that
--
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
no,
but
i
think,
i
think
one
of
the
--
and
i
hope
to
elaborate
on
this,
at
a
later
portion
of
my
argument,
one
of
the
factors
i
think
going
to
whether
the
case
is
right
at
this
juncture
mr.
justice
stewart
is
precisely
whether
the
harm
that
caused
by
refusing
to
obey
and
by
challenging
this
regulation
at
a
later
point
rather
at
the
present
point
whether
that
is
an
irreparable
harm
or
whether
it's
just
a
matter
of
challenging
later
rather
than
now.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
that's
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
issue
of
rightness
which
is
common
about
these
cases
is
one,
which
is
this
court
noted
well
ago
in
the
rochester
telephone
case
in
327
u.s.
is
not
limited
to
administrative
regulations
or
administrative
law
problems
but
applies
across
the
board
to
a
variety
of
instances
in
which
statutes
maybe
construed.
let
me
turn
first
then
to
these
generally
applicable
principles
of
rightness
in
the
context
of
this
case.
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
whether,
mr.
justice
black,
whether
the
issue
presented
the
legal
issue
which
is
presented
for
decision
by
the
court
is
appropriate
to
be
heard
now
or
at
some
point
when
it's
more
definite
and
certain
who
is
hurt
and
how
they're
hurt.
we
submit
that
this
court
has
held
in
a
variety
of
instances
and
properly
so
that
hypothetical
or
future
harms
to
a
person
or
to
a
--
to
a
plaintiff
in
any
suit
are
not
the
stuff
of
which
adjudication
is
made
and
that
it's
appropriate
ordinarily
to
wait
until
a
party
is
individually
and
specifically
harmed
in
some
definite
manner
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
no,
we
think
they're
quite
different.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we
think
they're
quite
different
but
we
think
they're
both
--
both
elements
that
enter
into
this
question.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
in
the
--
in
maybe
in
a
broad
sense
of
what
case
or
controversy
means.
of
course
this
court
has
at
times
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
used
to
term
case
or
controversy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
--that's
established
law
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
certainly.
but
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that
mr.
justice
white,
that
court
generally
exercise
their
discretion
when
cases
are
not
exercised
at
discretion.
but
they
do
not
entertain
premature
suits.
they
do
not
entertain
actions
which
although
there
is
according
to
the
plaintiff's
complaint
a
present
difference
with
the
government
agency
or
with
the
defendant
nonetheless
a
plaintiff
is
not
adequately
harmed
at
just
that
precise
time
and
will
be
able
to
challenge
the
regulation
in
the
future.
i
think
that's
a
key
element
here,
that
there
is
really
nobody
is
suggesting,
and
mr.
gessell
as
at
various
times
adverted
to
improper
or
suggested
that
there's
some
impropriety
in
the
government
putting
off
the
decision
in
this
case.
now,
of
course
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
this
regulation
will
never
be
tested.
the
only
question
is
whether
it
should
be
tested
now
or
in
a
particular
suit
involving
a
particular
label
in
which
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
the
attorney
general
determined
that
under
the
food
and
drug
administration's
construction
of
this
act,
that
label
violates
the
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
he
is
alleging
that
he
is
going
to
be
suffering
irreparable
injury
but
he's
focusing
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
--
we
think
he's
focusing
on
the
wrong
thing
mr.
justice
black.
he's
saying
he
suffers
irreparable
injury
if
he
obeys
the
regulation.
the
real
question
is
does
he
suffer
irreparable
injury
if
he
waits
until
that
later
action
when
he
can
challenge
the
regulation.
and
we
say
he
does
not
suffer
irreparable
injury
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
ordinary
rightness
decisions
if
he
waits
until
later.
in
other
words,
there's
no
question
mr.
justice
black
that
if
he
listens
to
this
regulation
and
he
follows
it
that
he
will
have
to
change
the
label
he
is
now
using.
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
but
the
real
issue
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
but
the
real
issue
is
not,
that
injury,
the
real
issue
mr.
justice
black
is
whether
if
he
waits
until
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
the
attorney
general
proceed
against
him
will
he
because
of
waiting
before
to
suffer
some
irreparable
injury
and
our
point
is
that
the
delay
doesn't
cause
them
any
injury
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
other
than
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
have
to
change
his
labels
today
if
he
in
good
faith
believes
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
an
error
in
its
construction
of
the
statute,
then
he
continues
to
use
his
own
labels
in
labeling.
mr.
nathan
lewin
theoretically,
they
could
be
prosecuted
criminally
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
because
we
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
true.
but
we
think
that
danger
of
being
prosecuted
criminally
is
precisely
the
kind
of
injury
that
any
person
who
is
theoretically
subject
to
a
criminal
statute
can
allege.
a
very
perfect
recent
instance
we
think
mr.
justice
black
is
what
this
court
did
has
done
in
the
travel
to
cuba
regulations.
in
zemel
and
rusk,
the
plaintiff
in
that
suit
brought
an
action
against
the
secretary
of
state
seeking
to
have
--
the
travel
to
cuba
restriction
declared
not
only
invalid
in
the
sense
that
he
wanted
to
have
his
passport
validated
to
cuba,
but
also
seeking
ruling
from
the
court,
a
declaratory
judgment
that
would
it
would
not
violate
section
215,
the
immigration
nationality
act
for
him
to
travel
to
cuba.
this
court
very
clearly
held
that
it
was
premature
to
consider
that
challenge
to
the
criminal
statute
at
that
point
although
he
was
subject
to
the
harm
of
criminal
prosecution
if
he
then
traveled
to
cuba
which
he
had
every
intention
according
to
him
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
there's
intention
of
doing.
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
went
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
they
hadn't
won
then
--
then
that
--
and
then
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
in
that
case
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
that
indicates
why
they
should
not
be
able
to
stop
it
before
because
if
they're
wrong
they
should
not
be
able
to
--
this
court
held
that
they
could
not
in
advance
of
their
committing
their
criminal
act
obtained
from
a
court
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
statute
as
officially
construed
by
the
department
of
state
would
apply
to
their
conduct.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
yes.
yes,
when
--
we
--
there's
no
claim
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
remedies
are
two
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
is
seizure
or
injunction,
the
attorney
general
on
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
seizure
in
chaos
(ph)
in
any
case
of
misbranding,
seizing
a
shipment
or
whatever
product,
a
carton
of
the
goods
and
having
a
suit,
a
viable
action
then
in
the
district
court
in
which
the
attorney
general
is
required
to
establish
that
the
drugs
are
misbranded
and
therefore
subject
to
seizure.
now,
they
would
not
be
mr.
gessell
spoke
of
multiple
seizures.
multiple
seizures
are
not
authorized
in
these
circumstances.
multiple
seizures
are
authorized
under
the
statute
only
when
the
drug
that's
being
sold
is
hazardous
or
dangerous
to
health
in
some
way.
when
the
only
misbranding
that's
involved
is
a
violation
of
this
kind
of
a
statute
or
as
construed
by
the
regulation,
there
is
no
authority
from
multiple
seizures.
so
the
only
possibility
here
on
the
civil
side
and
it's
been
the
consistent
practice
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
apply
civil
remedies
when
there
are
litigable
issues
of
construction
of
a
statute
of
this
kind.
the
only
remedies
would
be
seizure
or
injunction.
now,
those
are
precisely
the
remedies
--
they
don't
have
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
not
by
a
drug
company.
in
other
words,
these
remedies
would
be
by
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
none.
none.
those
rules
ordinarily
would
be
subject
to
the
specific
remedies
outlined
in
the
act.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
when
the
food
and
drug
administration
believes
that
a
drug
company
is
violating
the
act,
it
has
those
remedies.
a
drug
company
subject
to
an
order
which
is
of
the
legislative
congress
before,
and
the
one
specifically
enumerated
in
the
statute
where
there
is
delegated
to
the
food
and
drug
administration,
the
power
to
promulgate
regulation
regarding
deleterious
substances,
ordinarily
has
review
by
way
of
the
specific
remedy
provided
in
the
statute
which
is
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
nathan
lewin
as
i
understand
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
rationale,
i
think
it
would
have
to
apply
in
that
case
although
in
your
circumstances
mr.
justice
fortas
there
are
other
remedies
provide
in
the
statute
in
which
a
drug
company
can
review
but
i
think
that
precisely
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that's
precisely
our
main
ground
of
objection
here
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
food
and
drug
administration
would
be
delighted
to
have
an
authoritative
determination
of
--
by
a
court
of
--
at
least
the
validity
of
this
regulation.
and
it
turns
out
in
this
case
that
such
a
determination
in
this
particular
suit
would
affect
and
buying
most
of
the
large
drug
companies
in
the
united
states
and
would
authoritatively
settle
the
every
time
question.
the
real
problem
though
is
what
a
holding
of
this
kind
opens
the
doors
to
because
if
this
suit
can
be
brought
in
this
case
by
27
of
the
large
drug
companies
in
the
united
states,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
suit
being
brought
tomorrow
by
any
one
of
those
drug
companies
against
any
other
regulation
of
the
federal
--
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
indeed,
against
any
other
interpretative
regulation
or
indeed
against
even
another
clause
in
this
very
regulation.
this
regulation
was
issued
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
as
part
of
a
whole
sequence
of
regulations
administering
the
drug
amendments
of
1962.
drug
companies
were
given
the
opportunity
to
provide
to
supply
written
comments
to
those
proposed
regulations.
they
objected
not
merely
that
every
time
regulation
but
they
objected
also
to
the
requirement
in
this
regulation
that
the
generic
name
appear
in
conjunction
with
the
brand
name
that
it
appear
in
brackets
or
parenthesis.
now,
they
are
not
involved
in
the
suit,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
this
suit
can
be
maintained
is
absolutely
nothing
to
stop
any
one
of
these
drug
companies
from
bringing
another
suit
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
to
declare
that
provision
unjustified,
impermissible
under
the
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
there
are
none.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
now,
that's
precisely
our
principal
objection
to
what
their
claim
is.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
they
could
if
the
food
and
drug
administration
did
something
to
any
one
of
them
that
in
any
way
raised
a
present
controversy.
there
were
other
remedies
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
nothing
that
--
that
harms
any
one
of
them
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
in
such
a
way
that
they
would
not
be
harmed
if
they
waited
until
something
happened
to
them.
in
other
words,
nothing
has
really
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
there
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
is
a
question
of
degree
definitely
mr.
justice
black
but
we
think
that
the
allegations
here
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
in
the
circumstance.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
to
attack
this
regulation
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
without
--
yes,
without
the
food
and
drug
administration
doing
anything
more
or
the
attorney
general
doing
anything
more,
we
think
they
could
not
present
the
challenge
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right
and
that's
true
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
of
every
criminal
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
it's
true
of
every
criminal
statute
mr.
justice
black
that
if
you
violate
it
you
may
be
put
in
jail
and
that's
doesn't
entitle
you
to
go
to
court
and
say
may
i
now
violate
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
because
i
propose
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
it
makes
you
today.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
--
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
held
really
in
the
--
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
statute
that
you
can
do
that,
even
if
you
--
even
if
you
could
show
you
are
a
repeated
offender
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
i
think
where
--
the
only
claim
is
that
the
party
responsible
for
administering
the
criminal
statute
is
construing
it,
it's
applicable
to
my
case
whereas
really
it
shouldn't
–
it's
certainly
true
where
there
are
criminal
statutes
which
in
someway
affect
a
constitutional
right
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
they
do.
there's
no
claim
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
they
applied
for
example
with
a
new
drug
or
with
an
antibiotic
for
certification.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
i
have
no
--
our
objection
--
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
what
mr.
justice
fortas
was
suggesting
was
something
what
that
went
to
the
--
to
the
drafting
of
the
complaint.
our
objection
is
not
that
the
complaint
was
improperly
drafted
or
failed
to
allege
something
--
it's
just
that
nothing
had
happened
yet.
the
food
and
drug
administration
or
the
attorney
general
has
not
really
brought
this
regulation
to
the
point
where
any
one
of
these
plaintiffs
is
being
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
say
we
will
not
until
the
regulation
--
until
the
validity
of
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
regulation
has
been
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
disclaim
a
purpose
to
prosecute
in
the
sense
of
criminal
prosecution,
yes.
we
say
though
that
we
will
have
this
regulation
tested
either
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
either
civil
forfeitures
or
through
the
new
drug
clearance
procedures
provided
for
under
the
act
which
any
one
of
these
companies
can
submit
a
new
drug
or
an
antibiotic
for
certification,
refused
to
have
it
labeled
in
accordance
with
this
regulation
and
then
appeal
from
the
refusal
of
food
and
drug
administration
to
certify
the
antibiotic
or
to
approve
a
new
drug
for
sale,
appeal
from
that
under
the
procedures
in
the
food
and
drug
act
which
authorize
to
review
directly
in
a
court
of
appeals.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
i
was
just
coming
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
that
irrespective
of
the
questions
of
rightness
that
apply
generally
and
would
apply
to
none
and
to
actions
not
affecting
administrative
agency,
in
this
case,
the
food
and
drug
act,
both
congress
and
this
court
have
recognized
that
suits
of
this
kind
brought
out
of
the
usual
course,
prematurely
will
do
serious
harm
to
the
administration
of
an
act
which
had
a
substantial,
remedial
impact
on
the
nation's
consumers
in
this
entire
area.
in
mytinger
and
casselberry
in
339,
u.s.,
this
court
specifically
noted
that
really
are
held
that
in
a
case
which
was
far
more
right
really
than
this
one
in
the
sense
that
they
were
really
two
adversaries
contesting
a
particular
product
at
a
point
in
time
when
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
proceeding
against
that
product.
nonetheless
this
court
held
that
it
would
be
undermining
the
intent
of
congress
under
the
food
and
drug
and
cosmetic
act
to
allow
review
at
that
point.
and
we
think
that
the
entire
legislative
history
of
this
act
demonstrates
as
much
because
there
was
much
tugging
and
pulling
in
congress
before
section
701
(f)
which
provides
the
judicial
review
of
only
very
limited
number
of
orders
was
finally
enacted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right
and
we
think
that
the
--
that
the
fact,
the
review
scheme
that
the
statute
provide
we
think
is
really
exclusive
at
to
these
kinds
of
procedures
the
kind
of
proceeding
is
calculated
to
get
expeditious
resolution
of
this
--
of
these
kind
of
questions
because
if
this
suit
had
not
been
brought
when
it
was
it
would've
been
a
matter
of
weeks
or
months
before
an
application
would
have
been
made
for
a
new
drug
or
would
have
been
passed
on
by
the
food
and
drug
administration,
it
would've
been
up
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
very
regulation
in
all
its
parts
would've
been
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
review.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it's
less
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
less
right
in
those
cases
because
in
both
columbian
broadcasting
and
in
storer,
those
were
the
kind
of
situations
which
we
think
there
was
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
an
irreparable
harm.
there
was
a
fish
or
cut
bait
position
that
the
defendants
in
those
cases
may
have
been
put
in
to,
where
the
people
were
subject
to
those
regulations.
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
they
hadn't
been
applied.
but
on
the
other
hand
those
particular
individuals
or
plaintiffs
in
those
suits
had
to
make
at
that
point
decisions
which
--repercussions
of
which
would
be
felt
only
later.
in
other
words,
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
for
example,
the
plaintiff
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
case
would
have
to
sever
its
contract
with
the
variety
of
licensees
if
it
was
going
to
obey
that
order.
if
it
was
going
to
wait
until
later
to
test
it,
assuming
then
that
the
time
that
had
lapse
that
they
waited
until
they
actually
felt
the
pinch
of
that
regulation,
they
would
have
irrevocably
loss
certain
options
that
were
opened
to
them
at
that
stage.
i
think
the
clearest
illustration
of
this
is
not
a
case
in
this
court
but
is
in
the
nash-finch
case
which
the
petitioners
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
rely
on.
the
nash-finch
case
in
288
f.2d,
where
the
federal
trade
commission
had
issued
a
regulation
saying,
that
they
construed
the
statute
as
in
effect
of
waiving
all
rights
unless
the
party
sought
review
within
60
days
in
a
court
of
appeals.
now,
if
you
waited
until
you
felt
the
pinch
of
that
regulation,
you
would
lose
your
time
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
in
those
cases,
those
are
the
kinds
of
instances
we
think
with
the
delay
itself
works
the
harm.
in
other
words,
if
delay
really
having
those
questions
reviewed
later
rather
than
now
is
what
causes
harm,
then
we
think
you're
entitled
to
possibly
to
go
in
an
earlier
stage
and
seek
--
and
seek
relief
at
that
stage.
but
if
there's
no
harm
caused
from
the
delay
other
than
possibility
of
seizure
which
this
court
held
in
mytinger
and
casselberry
under
the
food
and
drug
act
was
not
enough
to
give
you
the
right
to
go
in
and
sue
in
advance
even
though
it
might
harm
your
reputation,
then
we
don't
have
a
right
to
go
into
that
stage.

presents
a
closer
question
but
we
nonetheless
think
that
in
that
case
because
the
commission
has
enforcement
power
itself
because
there
was
a
separate
statute
authorized
in
review
unlike
--
broadly
of
all
commission
orders,
for
that
reason
we
think
frozen
food
express
might
be
distinguished
from
the
present
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
because
we
are
–
and
we
think
it's
plain
from
the
legislative
history
and
we
try
to
outline
it
in
our
brief
that
what
congress
was
concerned
with
was
the
delay
that
would
be
caused
by
pre-enforcement
judicial
review.
when
congress
moved
--
at
a
very
late
stage,
congress
moved
the
remedies
from
the
district
courts
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
doing
to
expedite
the
enforcement
of
food
and
drug
regulations,
it
would
as
the
contrary
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
and
that
was
amended
at
a
very
late
stage,
put
them
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
purpose
of
that
was
to
expedite
it.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
what
you're
doing
in
the
very
same
breadth
is
opening
the
door
to
a
wide
variety
of
actions
in
the
district
courts,
then
all
you're
doing
is
you're
adding
another
level
of
judicial
review,
you're
slowing
down
the
proceeding,
and
we
think
this
case
and
the
one
that
follows
it
demonstrate
quite
clearly
how
that,
why
that's
true.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right,
congress
wouldn't
have
any
--
we
think
the
whole
fight
(voice
overlap)
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely.
but
we
think
mr.
justice
harlan
if
you
take
the
reading
of
section
701
(f)
(6)
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
do
and
that
the
second
circuit
did
in
the
toilet
goods
case,
then
that
whole
scrap
becomes
utterly
meaningless
because
congress
in
the
one
hand
was
fighting
really
tooth-and-nail
about
exactly
which
kinds
of
regulations,
you
should
subject
to
review
in
a
specific
review
provision
when
it
was
in
the
other
hand
just
giving
away
or
authorizing
companies
such
as
those
that
are
involved
in
these
two
cases
to
institute
an
action
at
any
time
they
like
in
the
district
court.
that's
in
effect
the
consequence
of
what
a
petitioner's
argument,
that
congress
was
fighting
about
a
specific
review
provision
when
it
was
at
the
same
breadth
intending
to
save
a
broad
range
of
case
and
which
could
always
be
instituted
in
the
district
court
under
declaratory
judgments
act.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
we
think
what
that
was
intended
to
reserve
in
light
of
the
congressional
uncertainty
at
that
time
as
to
what
would
be
available,
that
was
intended
to
preserve
we
think
--
really
the
remedies
--
first
of
all
at
(f)
(6)
mr.
justice
harlan
specifically
refers
to
the
remedy
in
this
subsection.
in
other
words,
saying
that
the
remedy
specifically
provided
for
an
(f)
(1)
are
not
to
derogate
from
any
other
remedies
available.
in
other
words
--
and
we
think
congress
is
referring
only
to
review
of
those
kinds
of
regulations
and
what
congress
was
saying
we
think
is
that
their
90-day-limitations
period
and
all
the
very
specific
provisions
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
not
to
apply
in
cases
where
for
example
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
not
followed
the
procedures
outlined
in
the
prior
subsection
where
for
example,
they
hadn't
given
notice
to
the
parties,
they
hadn't
given
them
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
in
those
kind
of
cases
or
in
substantive
due
process
cases
of
some
kind
it
was
still
permissible
to
go
into
a
district
court
after
the
90-day-period
had
expired
and
bring
an
action.
