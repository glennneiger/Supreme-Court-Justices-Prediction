mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
third
circuit.
it
involves
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
the
petitioners
here
plaintiffs
below
are
group
of
drug
companies
who
were
confronted
with
a
mandatory
enforcement
regulation
which
they
believe
was
issued
beyond
the
statute
and
beyond
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
and
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drugs.
accordingly,
they
filed
a
suit
in
the
district
court
at
wilmington
under
the
declaratory
judgment
of
the
statute
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
asking
for
relief
from
the
mandatory
enforced
with
requirements
of
this
particular
regulation
alleging
that
they
were
seriously
injured
in
their
business
in
any
way
which
i
will
refer
to
later
in
some
more
detail.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
mr.
justice
stewart
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
case
was
heard
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
there
are
no
facts
in
dispute.
it's
a
pure
issue
of
law
as
to
what
this
particular
section
of
the
statute
means.
all
administrative
proceedings
are
over.
these
petitioners
or
plaintiffs
stand
in
the
posture
where
they
must
conform
with
this
regulation
which
they
consider
invalid
or
they
must
get
to
redress
through
this
action
in
the
court
or
await
being
sued.
if
they
simply
await
being
sued
and
undertake
to
exist
that
they
are
paroled,
they
will
be
subject
to
criminal
proceedings.
they
will
be
subject
to
civil
proceedings
in
the
way
of
injunction.
they
will
be
subject
to
seizure,
indeed
multiple
seizure,
of
their
products.
and
they
are
also
subject
to
what
perhaps
is
the
most
reprehensible
situation
of
all
which
undoubtedly
some
members
of
the
court
would
be
familiar.
the
indirect
enforcement
power
of
this
agency
to
deny
company's
opportunity
to
put
drugs
on
the
market
or
denied
on
certifications
and
in
other
petty
administrative
ways
prevent
companies
that
wish
to
challenge
this
legislation
from
going
about
their
otherwise
lawful
and
normal
business.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
think
it's
seriously
reprehensible
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
indirect
type
of
enforcement
of
that
kind
puts
a
company
in
a
position
where
it
is
unable
to
get
the
type
of
hearing
which
our
type
of
society
contemplates
should
be
appropriate.
now,
the
issue
here
is
i
believe
quite
narrow.
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
found
that
the
companies
had
standing
to
sue
that
there
was
a
right
to
bring
an
action
under
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
the
district
judge
then
proceeded
to
the
merits
and
held
that
the
plaintiffs
were
correct
with
respect
to
the
interpretations
of
the
statute.
when
the
government
took
the
matter
to
the
third
circuit,
the
third
circuit
did
not
come
to
the
issue
on
the
merits.
the
third
circuit
took
the
position
that
the
food
and
drug
act
did
not
provide
a
basis
for
a
suit
such
as
has
been
brought
here
and
held
that
the
controversy
was
not
right
that
there
was
no
threatened,
haste
or
controversy
and
that
therefore
the
action
was
premature.
and
petitioners
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
ground
without
the
court
of
appeals
coming
to
the
merits.
we
accordingly
are
here
on
a
–
cert
was
granted
on
a
procedural
question
as
to
the
whether
or
not
a
case
or
controversy
exists
in
the
face
of
this
allegedly
illegal
regulation
and
whether
the
statute
permits
if
there
is
a
right
of
controversy
as
we
feel
there
is,
whether
the
statute
permits
this
particular
type
of
action.
now,
the
regulation
in
issue
is
designated
by
the
defendants
as
an
enforcement
statute.
it
is
immediately
operative
and
it
applies
to
all
prescription
drugs
and
to
all
companies
selling
prescription
drugs
throughout
the
united
states.
it
is
mandatory
in
its
terms,
it
is
stated
in
the
words
of
command
and
it
directs
compliance.
and
the
statute
is
so
worded
and
the
regulation
is
so
worded
that
if
a
company
chooses
not
to
comply,
its
drugs
will
be
deemed
misbranded
and
accordingly
all
of
the
consequences
that
flow
upon
a
misbranded
article
under
the
statute
criminal,
civil
and
other
types
of
sanctions
apply.
the
particular
regulation
in
issue
is
a
regulation
that
directs
that
in
the
case
of
a
prescription
drug
whether
a
label
be
used
or
an
advertisement
be
used
any
type
of
printed
literature
of
any
kind
every
time
the
brand
name
or
trade
name
of
the
drug
is
used,
that
must
appear
opposite
the
generic
name
that
is
to
say
the
technical
name
of
the
particular
drug.
the
agency
takes
the
position
that
the
provisions
of
502
(e)
(1)
of
the
statute
which
are
printed
at
page
4
(a)
of
my
main
brief
if
the
court
please
requires
this
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
take
the
position
that
the
statute
requires
only
that
there
be
prominent
display
of
the
generic
name
and
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
that
name
appear
every
time,
all
the
time
whenever
the
brand
name
appears.
it
is
mr.
chief
justice,
as
all
were
--
we
had
briefs
before
your
honor
here
with
some
40
plaintiffs
and
every
time
we
said
“petitioners”
we
put
a
parenthesis
in
and
spelled
out
the
names
of
the
40
different
companies
that
are
before
you
today.
now,
the
--
the
injury
that
is
facing
this
industry
is
of
several
types.
they
are
not
only
facing
these
sanctions
but
they
would
be
required
under
these
regulations
to
change
their
materials,
to
undergo
addition
expense,
to
publish
a
type
of
literature
that
would
be
certainly
at
the
least
confusing
and
far
less
effective.
we
think
the
controversy
is
clearly
right
for
adjudication.
the
statute's
directions
are
explicit
and
the
question
presented
is
a
mere
and
simple
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
reads
the
way
the
food
and
drug
administration
says
it
reads.
there's
an
impact
that
is
clearly
adverse
on
the
business
of
these
petitioners,
the
regulation
controls
the
manner
in
which
they
have
to
conduct
their
business.
it
sets
a
standard
of
conduct
and
there
are
no
further
administrative
proceedings
or
any
other
thing
of
that
kind
to
which
they
can
advert.
the
government
says
there's
an
exemption
provision
but
that
is
not
the
case,
the
exemption
provision
does
not
read
with
respect
to
the
advertising
aspects
of
the
regulation.
so
this
problem,
this
horns
of
the
dilemma
officer's
choice
or
which
you
want
to
call
it,
that
confronts
these
companies
is
a
realistic,
actual
and
immediate
type
of
controversy
from
which
the
only
relief
that
they
can
seek
is
by
asking
for
declaratory
judgment
and
protection
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
unless
they
simply
want
to
sit
back
and
face
the
penalty
uncertain
as
to
time,
uncertain
as
to
his
business
consequences,
certain
to
contain
highly
adverse
publicity,
certain
to
bring
discredit
upon
the
company
if
they're
sued
in
one
form
or
another
in
some
manner
or
another.
now,
we
have
a
very
interesting
situation
here
after
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
case
held
that
the
controversy
was
not
right,
the
companion
case
to
be
argued
next
came
before
the
second
circuit
and
there
judge
friendly
dealt
with
the
very
problem
that
i'm
dealing
with
here,
discussed
in
specific
detail,
the
decision
in
our
third
circuit
case
and
held
quite
contrary
to
the
third
circuit
that
--
and
in
the
manner
in
which
we
say
is
the
appropriate
type
of
holding
here
that
the
controversy
was
right,
that
there
was
a
judiciable
controversy,
and
that
it
should
be
determined
now
and
not
at
some
later
time.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
on
the
question
of
the
rightness
mr.
justice
stewart,
of
the
controversy,
there
are
substantial
differences
between
the
two
proceedings
(voice
overlap)
but
on
the
questions
of
whether
this
type
of
threat
from
a
regulation
creates
a
right
controversy,
there
was
agreement
--
there
is
agreement,
and
the
two
cases
are
all
the
same.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
counsel
in
the
next
case
have
a
very
trouble
some
problem
because
they
have
numerous
factual
issues
and
they
seek
to
distinguish
the
two
cases
i
suppose
because
of
that.
in
our
situation,
unlike
theirs,
there
is
no
confusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute
in
its
–
or
the
regulation
in
its
operations.
there
is
no
further
proceedings
before
any
court,
there
is
nothing
to
determine
except
what
this
statutes
means.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
as
i
read
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
start
there,
if
the
process
of
rule
making
is
complete,
this
court
has
said
that
is
a
final
agency
action.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
think
that
is
all
we
have
before
us
here
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
i
am
sure
there
are
types
of
--
there
are
types
of
agency
action
short
of
rule
making
which
perhaps
because
of
their
emergency
character
or
something
else
would
fall
in
a
different
basis.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
oh,
yes
and
it
is
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no,
it
is.
it
is
a
position
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
of
this
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no.
no
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
issue
specifically
has
been
decided
by
this
court
in
three
cases,
columbia
broadcasting,
frozen
foods
and
storer
have
all
dealt
with
that
question
and
have
all
decided
that
the
controversy
was
right.
there,
there
were
rules
by
the
federal
communications
commission
for
example
in
both
storer
and
columbia
broadcasting
that
specified
that
a
station
could
only
--
broadcasting
company
could
only
own
so
many
stations
or
that
a
certain
types
of
contracts
would
be
considered
improper
and
a
license
would
be
canceled
if
the
matter
came
up.
and
the
court
in
both
of
those
instances
said
that
the
matter
was
right
and
it
could
be
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
decided
without
enforcement
of
the
regulations.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no,
we
just
say
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
that
the
statute
doesn't
permit
this,
that
in
terms
of
the
merit
in
broadcasting,
this
goes
beyond
and
that
there
is
no
power
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
to
change
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
we
--
we
consider
it
unreasonable
but
the
way
the
case
has
come
up
there
isn't
any
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes
we
do.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
i
think
not
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
in
this
case
our
allegations
on
which
we
rest
our
charges
of
unreasonableness
all
conceded.
it's
conceded
this
is
confusing,
it's
conceded
that
this
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
the
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
here
and
all
of
our
allegations
of
our
complaint
are
accepted
as
fact.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
your
honor
i
think
the
reason
for
it,
i
think
it
isn't
extraordinary
because
it
is
confusing.
but
i
think
the
reason
--
the
reason
for
it
is
that
the
secretary
has
taken
the
position
from
the
beginning
that
this
is
the
only
interpretation
which
the
statute
permits.
this
is
not
an
economic
regulation,
this
is
not
a
regulation
dealing
with
questions
of
safety,
this
is
not
a
regulation
that
says,
we
really
think
we
have
to
do
this
in
our
expertise.
this
is
a
regulation
that
issues
because
he
says,
this
is
what
the
statute
means,
it's
the
only
thing
it
means,
and
this
is
the
way
it
has
to
run.
now,
i
would
also
say
this
in
response
to
your
honor's
question
that
where
you
have
issues
of
fact
and
i
would
think
perhaps
that
would
be
the
case
in
many
of
the
type
of
situation
you
postulated,
this
statute
provides
that
there
has
to
be,
in
the
rule
making
process,
an
evidentiary
type
hearing
and
then
that
is
reviewed
by
a
court
of
appeals.
we
have
now
an
evidence
--
any
underlying
evidentiary
hearing
for
this
regulation
whatsoever.
this
is
just
a
mandatory
direction
from
the
secretary
as
to
how
he
proposes
to
enforce
this
particular
provision
of
the
statute.
and
since
there
is
nothing
on
which
to
take
testimony,
nothing
on
which
to
concern
ourselves
except
what
the
statute
means,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
way
an
industry
should
be
proceed
to
get
a
standard
rule
of
conduct
determined
when
the
secretary
attempts
to
impose
that
illegally.
and
it's
--
it's
rather
amusing
here
that
when
the
defendants
here
are
turned
in
an
--
because
they're
rather
troubled
by
this
decision
of
the
third
circuit,
they
don't
support
it
in
many
particulars,
when
they
turn
to
the
question
of
the
merits
which
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
cert
petition
but
they
say,
“well,
why
don't
--
why
don't
you
decide
the
merits
while
you're
here”,
they
say
this
is
a
simple
case.
there's
no
controversy,
the
public
interest
requires
it
to
be
promptly
determined,
and
let's
go
at
it
and
decide
it.
and
i
almost
wondered
whether
the
same
person
wrote
the
first
part
of
the
brief
that
wrote
the
second
part
because
you
can't
--
in
the
context
of
this
case,
there
is
nothing
in
our
--
to
argue
about
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
regulation,
as
to
the
reasons
for
the
regulation,
and
it's
a
pure
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
the
other
aspect
of
our
case
concerns
whether
or
not
congress
precluded
this
type
of
review.
and
i
would
like
in
few
brief
moments
to
deal
with
that
question.
we
have
in
this
statute
a
saving's
clause
which
states
the
remedies
provided
for
at
this
subsection,
this
is
on
page
6
(a)
of
my
appendix
shall
be
in
addition
to
and
not
in
substitution
for
any
other
remedies
provided
by
law.
the
entire
legislative
history
is
full
of
discussion
about
the
right
to
bring
injunctive
actions,
declaratory
judgment
actions,
no
report
of
congress,
no
words
in
the
statute
are
designed
in
any
way
to
say
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act
do
not
apply
here.
and
we
are
unable
to
see
how
particularly
in
the
face
of
the
saving
clause
which
we
believe
has
general
application
and
the
debates
that
one
can
say
that
congress
must
have
intended,
the
government
says
or
we
must
assume
they
say.
well,
there's
no
basis
for
such
assumptions,
no
basis
for
that
intention,
and
that
the
literature
of
this
court
is
full
of
declarations
that
say
we
want
a
favor
the
right
of
citizens
to
review
actions
of
regulatory
bodies.
and
i
would
like
just
for
a
moment
before
you
adjourn
for
lunch
to
leave
this
thought
with
you,
i've
been
mitigating
around
this
country
a
good
deal
in
the
last
few
years
and
it's
a
surprising
thing
to
see
the
number
of
times,
the
government
is
seeking
to
prevent
a
fair
test
of
their
power
or
their
right
to
do
something.
they
raise
sovereign
immunity,
they
raise
standing
to
sue,
they
raise
venue
questions,
they
raise
questions
of
who
should
be
the
party.
and
the
atmosphere
was
not
unlike
that
with
i
heard
in
this
court
last
thursday
with
respect
to
the
question
of
this
court's
mandate
in
el
paso.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
government
attitude
is
that
we
want
to
have
it
our
way,
we
want
to
make
businessmen
knuckle
under
and
comply
to
illegal
regulations
because
we
have
all
these
indirect
and
subversive
opportunities
to
force
compliance,
and
we
hope
that
everybody
relied
on,
we
hope
that
everybody
will
not
challenge
the
statute
that
enough
people
will
be
frightened
to
adhere
to
the
regulation
even
when
it's
invalid
and
thus
we'll
have
a
long
period
of
administrative
compliance
which
will
support
the
regulation.
thank
you.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
my
colleagues
over
lunch
hour,
indicated
i
may
have
missed
the
import
of
one
of
your
questions
mr.
justice
fortas
or
at
least
i
have
not
made
clear
one
point
that's
essential
to
our
position.
this
regulation
operates
from
the
day
it
issues.
it
doesn't
operates
as
to
some
pieces
of
literature
just
some
pieces
of
advertising,
just
to
some
labels,
just
to
some
books,
and
not
other
books,
or
some
bulletins
and
other
bulletins.
it
operates
as
to
everything
in
the
prescription
drug
industry
that
comes
under
the
rubric
of
labeling
or
under
the
rubric
of
advertising
and
by
the
time
you
put
advertising
and
labeling
in
their
broad
definitions
together,
it's
safe
to
say
in
every
piece
of
literature
that
these
drug
companies
ever
get
put
out,
outside
of
their
own
internal
affairs
and
probably
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
some
of
that.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
here
we're
concerned
with
prescription
drugs
and
those
are
the
drugs
you
normally
know
mr.
justice
douglas
as
sold
by
prescription
and
of
course
the
audience
to
which
this
literature
is
directed,
either
advertising
or
labeling
is
to
the
position.
and
not
the
public,
and
what
they're
saying
is
that
every
time
no
matter
what
the
circumstance
we
mentioned
the
brand
name,
we
mustn't
mention
the
generic
name,
no
matter
how
prominently
we
have
made
the
generic
name
in
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
it
will
be
on
that
--
it
will
be
on
that
label.
but
of
course
you
can't
get
that
unless
the
doctor
prescribes
it,
you
can't
go
take
it
off
the
shelf.
it's
not
over
the
counter
product.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
and
sold
only
under
--
not
only
by
pharmacists.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
that's
right.
it
doesn't
apply
to
aspirin
for
example.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
or
things
of
that
kind.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
the
government
tries
to
avoid
the
criminal
case
by
saying
they're
not
going
to
bring
any
even
though
the
statute
lets
them
do
it.
the
solicitor
general
tries
to
duck
under
and
out
on
that.
the
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white
is
yes
but
the
factors
that
lead
us
to
the
view
that
review
is
necessary
now
are
the
desirability
of
uniformity
in
this
industry
and
the
desirability
of
avoiding
the
hazards
and
the
disadvantages
that
come
and
attend
in
publicity
to
come
if
you're
sued
criminally
or
if
all
your
goods
are
involved
in
multiple
seizures.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
would
be
here
making
the
argument
in
the
event
there
was
any
particular
move
by
the
government
against
a
particular
label
or
ad
of
a
particular
company
at
some
particular
time.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
that's
right,
if
they
had
done
that
i
would
be
here.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no
say
they're
going
to
enforce
the
statute
and
they
say
it's
an
enforcement
statute
and
the
regulation
says
shall
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
(voice
overlap)
of
command.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
what
i
say
with
respect
to
that
is
that
the
savings
clause
enabled
us
to
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
there
is
a
--
the
statute
--
is
your
honor
referring
to
section
502
(e)?
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
or
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
or
are
you
referring
to
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes,
there
are
--
under
certain
sections,
there
is
a
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
direct
review
in
a
court
of
appeals.
and
i
thought,
that
what's
your
honor
had
in
mind.
now
that
occurs
where
there
are
factual
issues,
the
provisions
they
talk
about
are
where
there
would
have
been
an
evidentiary
hearing
prior
to
the
rule
making
before
the
board.
and
then
a
review
of
the
factual
basis
upon
which
the
particular
determination
was
made,
the
record
would
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
nothing
of
that
kind
here
at
all.
there're
no
factual
issues.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes.
yes,
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
maybe
i
still
can.
but
certainly,
without
a
special
provisions
for
appeal
or
review
to
a
court
of
appeals,
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
have
put
me
in
the
district
court.
i
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
unless
there's
a
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
any
questions.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
would
like
to
deal
with
two
words
that
have
been
used
this
afternoon
“premature
and
abstract”
and
i'd
like
to
simply
give
you
one
example
of
what
the
government
said
as
the
way
we
should
deal
with
this
problem.
i
suffer
from
gout
mr.
chief
justice
and
others
too,
suppose
the
company
has
developed
a
cure
for
gout
and
the
drug
has
cleared,
they
say
don't
lift
that
drug
on
the
market
because
we
will
not
approve
the
labeling
because
you
don't
have
generic
every
time
and
take
that
up
through
the
courts
for
a
period
of
two
to
two-and
a
half
years
to
get
these
regulations
straightened
out.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
my
answer
to
that
is
very
clear
and
simple.
in
that
context,
you
have
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing,
you
go
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
that's
all
there's
to
it.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
because
the
statute
does
not
cover
a
proceeding
of
this
kind
relating
to
this
type
of
regulation
which
issued
without
any
evidentiary
hearing
which
--
issued
without
any
factual
basis.
it's
an
(inaudible)
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
they
just
say
business
on
what
we
think
the
statute
means.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
you
do
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
case
you
put
to
be
mr.
justice.
right
now,
it's
going
on
in
the
field
of
vitamins
and
you
may
have
seen
in
the
newspapers.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
and
that's
the
type
of
regulation
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
that's
the
type
of
regulation
they
issue
on
the
questions
of
help
of
that
kind
after
they
taken
evidence,
after
they
have
heard
from
technical
people
and
after
they
have
a
fix
on
it.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
have
dealt
with
the
premature
point.
now,
it
is
--
now
it
is
not
abstract.
mr.
justice
douglas
asked,
what
is
involved
in
seizure?
and
he
was
advised
that
someone
seizes
libel-some
goods,
that
isn't
all
that's
involved.
we've
had
two
reason
seizures
against
drug
companies
banner
headlines
in
the
washington
post,
the
star,
and
all
the
newspapers
of
the
country
press
releases,
background
statements,
these
companies
are
in
the
sensitive
business.
and
the
necessity
of
having
to
meet
that
kind
of
publicity
barrage
or
the
company's
seizure
i
think
is
something
that
creates
a
real
quarrel
and
a
real
problem.
and
as
far
as
multiple
seizures
are
concerned
there
is
plenty
opportunity
here
to
seize
the
drugs
in
any
number
of
company
at
the
same
time,
one
company,
three
companies,
five
companies,
20
companies
and
the
government
is
trying
to
keep
total
chance
to
pick
and
choose
to
move
to
determine
its
strategy
hoping
in
the
meantime
that
by
this
jawbone
enforcement,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested,
people
will
comply
even
though
they
probably
clearly
in
view
with
the
district
judge
have
gone
beyond
the
law.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
there
is
not
mr.
justice
black.
there
is
an
argument
that
congress
precluded
this
type
of
action
even
if
it
is
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
and
we
say
that
they
never
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
the
court
of
appeals
so
ruled.
the
district
judge
ruled
on
the
merits
because
he
found
we
had
a
proper
complaint
for
property
in
court
and
he
said
we
were
right
about
the
regulation.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
not
right
and
that
congress
in
addition
had
precluded
this
type
of
action.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no
sir.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no,
and
i
don't
--
the
government
indicated
they
have
no
quarrel
with
our
complaints.
it's
a
good
complaint
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
third
circuit.
it
involves
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
the
petitioners
here
plaintiffs
below
are
group
of
drug
companies
who
were
confronted
with
a
mandatory
enforcement
regulation
which
they
believe
was
issued
beyond
the
statute
and
beyond
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
and
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drugs.
accordingly,
they
filed
a
suit
in
the
district
court
at
wilmington
under
the
declaratory
judgment
of
the
statute
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
asking
for
relief
from
the
mandatory
enforced
with
requirements
of
this
particular
regulation
alleging
that
they
were
seriously
injured
in
their
business
in
any
way
which
i
will
refer
to
later
in
some
more
detail.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
mr.
justice
stewart
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
case
was
heard
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
there
are
no
facts
in
dispute.
it's
a
pure
issue
of
law
as
to
what
this
particular
section
of
the
statute
means.
all
administrative
proceedings
are
over.
these
petitioners
or
plaintiffs
stand
in
the
posture
where
they
must
conform
with
this
regulation
which
they
consider
invalid
or
they
must
get
to
redress
through
this
action
in
the
court
or
await
being
sued.
if
they
simply
await
being
sued
and
undertake
to
exist
that
they
are
paroled,
they
will
be
subject
to
criminal
proceedings.
they
will
be
subject
to
civil
proceedings
in
the
way
of
injunction.
they
will
be
subject
to
seizure,
indeed
multiple
seizure,
of
their
products.
and
they
are
also
subject
to
what
perhaps
is
the
most
reprehensible
situation
of
all
which
undoubtedly
some
members
of
the
court
would
be
familiar.
the
indirect
enforcement
power
of
this
agency
to
deny
company's
opportunity
to
put
drugs
on
the
market
or
denied
on
certifications
and
in
other
petty
administrative
ways
prevent
companies
that
wish
to
challenge
this
legislation
from
going
about
their
otherwise
lawful
and
normal
business.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
think
it's
seriously
reprehensible
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
indirect
type
of
enforcement
of
that
kind
puts
a
company
in
a
position
where
it
is
unable
to
get
the
type
of
hearing
which
our
type
of
society
contemplates
should
be
appropriate.
now,
the
issue
here
is
i
believe
quite
narrow.
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
found
that
the
companies
had
standing
to
sue
that
there
was
a
right
to
bring
an
action
under
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
the
district
judge
then
proceeded
to
the
merits
and
held
that
the
plaintiffs
were
correct
with
respect
to
the
interpretations
of
the
statute.
when
the
government
took
the
matter
to
the
third
circuit,
the
third
circuit
did
not
come
to
the
issue
on
the
merits.
the
third
circuit
took
the
position
that
the
food
and
drug
act
did
not
provide
a
basis
for
a
suit
such
as
has
been
brought
here
and
held
that
the
controversy
was
not
right
that
there
was
no
threatened,
haste
or
controversy
and
that
therefore
the
action
was
premature.
and
petitioners
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
ground
without
the
court
of
appeals
coming
to
the
merits.
we
accordingly
are
here
on
a
–
cert
was
granted
on
a
procedural
question
as
to
the
whether
or
not
a
case
or
controversy
exists
in
the
face
of
this
allegedly
illegal
regulation
and
whether
the
statute
permits
if
there
is
a
right
of
controversy
as
we
feel
there
is,
whether
the
statute
permits
this
particular
type
of
action.
now,
the
regulation
in
issue
is
designated
by
the
defendants
as
an
enforcement
statute.
it
is
immediately
operative
and
it
applies
to
all
prescription
drugs
and
to
all
companies
selling
prescription
drugs
throughout
the
united
states.
it
is
mandatory
in
its
terms,
it
is
stated
in
the
words
of
command
and
it
directs
compliance.
and
the
statute
is
so
worded
and
the
regulation
is
so
worded
that
if
a
company
chooses
not
to
comply,
its
drugs
will
be
deemed
misbranded
and
accordingly
all
of
the
consequences
that
flow
upon
a
misbranded
article
under
the
statute
criminal,
civil
and
other
types
of
sanctions
apply.
the
particular
regulation
in
issue
is
a
regulation
that
directs
that
in
the
case
of
a
prescription
drug
whether
a
label
be
used
or
an
advertisement
be
used
any
type
of
printed
literature
of
any
kind
every
time
the
brand
name
or
trade
name
of
the
drug
is
used,
that
must
appear
opposite
the
generic
name
that
is
to
say
the
technical
name
of
the
particular
drug.
the
agency
takes
the
position
that
the
provisions
of
502
(e)
(1)
of
the
statute
which
are
printed
at
page
4
(a)
of
my
main
brief
if
the
court
please
requires
this
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
take
the
position
that
the
statute
requires
only
that
there
be
prominent
display
of
the
generic
name
and
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
that
name
appear
every
time,
all
the
time
whenever
the
brand
name
appears.
it
is
mr.
chief
justice,
as
all
were
--
we
had
briefs
before
your
honor
here
with
some
40
plaintiffs
and
every
time
we
said
“petitioners”
we
put
a
parenthesis
in
and
spelled
out
the
names
of
the
40
different
companies
that
are
before
you
today.
now,
the
--
the
injury
that
is
facing
this
industry
is
of
several
types.
they
are
not
only
facing
these
sanctions
but
they
would
be
required
under
these
regulations
to
change
their
materials,
to
undergo
addition
expense,
to
publish
a
type
of
literature
that
would
be
certainly
at
the
least
confusing
and
far
less
effective.
we
think
the
controversy
is
clearly
right
for
adjudication.
the
statute's
directions
are
explicit
and
the
question
presented
is
a
mere
and
simple
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
reads
the
way
the
food
and
drug
administration
says
it
reads.
there's
an
impact
that
is
clearly
adverse
on
the
business
of
these
petitioners,
the
regulation
controls
the
manner
in
which
they
have
to
conduct
their
business.
it
sets
a
standard
of
conduct
and
there
are
no
further
administrative
proceedings
or
any
other
thing
of
that
kind
to
which
they
can
advert.
the
government
says
there's
an
exemption
provision
but
that
is
not
the
case,
the
exemption
provision
does
not
read
with
respect
to
the
advertising
aspects
of
the
regulation.
so
this
problem,
this
horns
of
the
dilemma
officer's
choice
or
which
you
want
to
call
it,
that
confronts
these
companies
is
a
realistic,
actual
and
immediate
type
of
controversy
from
which
the
only
relief
that
they
can
seek
is
by
asking
for
declaratory
judgment
and
protection
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
unless
they
simply
want
to
sit
back
and
face
the
penalty
uncertain
as
to
time,
uncertain
as
to
his
business
consequences,
certain
to
contain
highly
adverse
publicity,
certain
to
bring
discredit
upon
the
company
if
they're
sued
in
one
form
or
another
in
some
manner
or
another.
now,
we
have
a
very
interesting
situation
here
after
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
case
held
that
the
controversy
was
not
right,
the
companion
case
to
be
argued
next
came
before
the
second
circuit
and
there
judge
friendly
dealt
with
the
very
problem
that
i'm
dealing
with
here,
discussed
in
specific
detail,
the
decision
in
our
third
circuit
case
and
held
quite
contrary
to
the
third
circuit
that
--
and
in
the
manner
in
which
we
say
is
the
appropriate
type
of
holding
here
that
the
controversy
was
right,
that
there
was
a
judiciable
controversy,
and
that
it
should
be
determined
now
and
not
at
some
later
time.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
on
the
question
of
the
rightness
mr.
justice
stewart,
of
the
controversy,
there
are
substantial
differences
between
the
two
proceedings
(voice
overlap)
but
on
the
questions
of
whether
this
type
of
threat
from
a
regulation
creates
a
right
controversy,
there
was
agreement
--
there
is
agreement,
and
the
two
cases
are
all
the
same.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
counsel
in
the
next
case
have
a
very
trouble
some
problem
because
they
have
numerous
factual
issues
and
they
seek
to
distinguish
the
two
cases
i
suppose
because
of
that.
in
our
situation,
unlike
theirs,
there
is
no
confusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute
in
its
–
or
the
regulation
in
its
operations.
there
is
no
further
proceedings
before
any
court,
there
is
nothing
to
determine
except
what
this
statutes
means.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
as
i
read
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
start
there,
if
the
process
of
rule
making
is
complete,
this
court
has
said
that
is
a
final
agency
action.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
think
that
is
all
we
have
before
us
here
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
i
am
sure
there
are
types
of
--
there
are
types
of
agency
action
short
of
rule
making
which
perhaps
because
of
their
emergency
character
or
something
else
would
fall
in
a
different
basis.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
oh,
yes
and
it
is
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no,
it
is.
it
is
a
position
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
of
this
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no.
no
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
issue
specifically
has
been
decided
by
this
court
in
three
cases,
columbia
broadcasting,
frozen
foods
and
storer
have
all
dealt
with
that
question
and
have
all
decided
that
the
controversy
was
right.
there,
there
were
rules
by
the
federal
communications
commission
for
example
in
both
storer
and
columbia
broadcasting
that
specified
that
a
station
could
only
--
broadcasting
company
could
only
own
so
many
stations
or
that
a
certain
types
of
contracts
would
be
considered
improper
and
a
license
would
be
canceled
if
the
matter
came
up.
and
the
court
in
both
of
those
instances
said
that
the
matter
was
right
and
it
could
be
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
decided
without
enforcement
of
the
regulations.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no,
we
just
say
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
that
the
statute
doesn't
permit
this,
that
in
terms
of
the
merit
in
broadcasting,
this
goes
beyond
and
that
there
is
no
power
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
to
change
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
we
--
we
consider
it
unreasonable
but
the
way
the
case
has
come
up
there
isn't
any
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes
we
do.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
i
think
not
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
in
this
case
our
allegations
on
which
we
rest
our
charges
of
unreasonableness
all
conceded.
it's
conceded
this
is
confusing,
it's
conceded
that
this
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
the
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
here
and
all
of
our
allegations
of
our
complaint
are
accepted
as
fact.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
your
honor
i
think
the
reason
for
it,
i
think
it
isn't
extraordinary
because
it
is
confusing.
but
i
think
the
reason
--
the
reason
for
it
is
that
the
secretary
has
taken
the
position
from
the
beginning
that
this
is
the
only
interpretation
which
the
statute
permits.
this
is
not
an
economic
regulation,
this
is
not
a
regulation
dealing
with
questions
of
safety,
this
is
not
a
regulation
that
says,
we
really
think
we
have
to
do
this
in
our
expertise.
this
is
a
regulation
that
issues
because
he
says,
this
is
what
the
statute
means,
it's
the
only
thing
it
means,
and
this
is
the
way
it
has
to
run.
now,
i
would
also
say
this
in
response
to
your
honor's
question
that
where
you
have
issues
of
fact
and
i
would
think
perhaps
that
would
be
the
case
in
many
of
the
type
of
situation
you
postulated,
this
statute
provides
that
there
has
to
be,
in
the
rule
making
process,
an
evidentiary
type
hearing
and
then
that
is
reviewed
by
a
court
of
appeals.
we
have
now
an
evidence
--
any
underlying
evidentiary
hearing
for
this
regulation
whatsoever.
this
is
just
a
mandatory
direction
from
the
secretary
as
to
how
he
proposes
to
enforce
this
particular
provision
of
the
statute.
and
since
there
is
nothing
on
which
to
take
testimony,
nothing
on
which
to
concern
ourselves
except
what
the
statute
means,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
way
an
industry
should
be
proceed
to
get
a
standard
rule
of
conduct
determined
when
the
secretary
attempts
to
impose
that
illegally.
and
it's
--
it's
rather
amusing
here
that
when
the
defendants
here
are
turned
in
an
--
because
they're
rather
troubled
by
this
decision
of
the
third
circuit,
they
don't
support
it
in
many
particulars,
when
they
turn
to
the
question
of
the
merits
which
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
cert
petition
but
they
say,
“well,
why
don't
--
why
don't
you
decide
the
merits
while
you're
here”,
they
say
this
is
a
simple
case.
there's
no
controversy,
the
public
interest
requires
it
to
be
promptly
determined,
and
let's
go
at
it
and
decide
it.
and
i
almost
wondered
whether
the
same
person
wrote
the
first
part
of
the
brief
that
wrote
the
second
part
because
you
can't
--
in
the
context
of
this
case,
there
is
nothing
in
our
--
to
argue
about
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
regulation,
as
to
the
reasons
for
the
regulation,
and
it's
a
pure
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
the
other
aspect
of
our
case
concerns
whether
or
not
congress
precluded
this
type
of
review.
and
i
would
like
in
few
brief
moments
to
deal
with
that
question.
we
have
in
this
statute
a
saving's
clause
which
states
the
remedies
provided
for
at
this
subsection,
this
is
on
page
6
(a)
of
my
appendix
shall
be
in
addition
to
and
not
in
substitution
for
any
other
remedies
provided
by
law.
the
entire
legislative
history
is
full
of
discussion
about
the
right
to
bring
injunctive
actions,
declaratory
judgment
actions,
no
report
of
congress,
no
words
in
the
statute
are
designed
in
any
way
to
say
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act
do
not
apply
here.
and
we
are
unable
to
see
how
particularly
in
the
face
of
the
saving
clause
which
we
believe
has
general
application
and
the
debates
that
one
can
say
that
congress
must
have
intended,
the
government
says
or
we
must
assume
they
say.
well,
there's
no
basis
for
such
assumptions,
no
basis
for
that
intention,
and
that
the
literature
of
this
court
is
full
of
declarations
that
say
we
want
a
favor
the
right
of
citizens
to
review
actions
of
regulatory
bodies.
and
i
would
like
just
for
a
moment
before
you
adjourn
for
lunch
to
leave
this
thought
with
you,
i've
been
mitigating
around
this
country
a
good
deal
in
the
last
few
years
and
it's
a
surprising
thing
to
see
the
number
of
times,
the
government
is
seeking
to
prevent
a
fair
test
of
their
power
or
their
right
to
do
something.
they
raise
sovereign
immunity,
they
raise
standing
to
sue,
they
raise
venue
questions,
they
raise
questions
of
who
should
be
the
party.
and
the
atmosphere
was
not
unlike
that
with
i
heard
in
this
court
last
thursday
with
respect
to
the
question
of
this
court's
mandate
in
el
paso.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
government
attitude
is
that
we
want
to
have
it
our
way,
we
want
to
make
businessmen
knuckle
under
and
comply
to
illegal
regulations
because
we
have
all
these
indirect
and
subversive
opportunities
to
force
compliance,
and
we
hope
that
everybody
relied
on,
we
hope
that
everybody
will
not
challenge
the
statute
that
enough
people
will
be
frightened
to
adhere
to
the
regulation
even
when
it's
invalid
and
thus
we'll
have
a
long
period
of
administrative
compliance
which
will
support
the
regulation.
thank
you.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
my
colleagues
over
lunch
hour,
indicated
i
may
have
missed
the
import
of
one
of
your
questions
mr.
justice
fortas
or
at
least
i
have
not
made
clear
one
point
that's
essential
to
our
position.
this
regulation
operates
from
the
day
it
issues.
it
doesn't
operates
as
to
some
pieces
of
literature
just
some
pieces
of
advertising,
just
to
some
labels,
just
to
some
books,
and
not
other
books,
or
some
bulletins
and
other
bulletins.
it
operates
as
to
everything
in
the
prescription
drug
industry
that
comes
under
the
rubric
of
labeling
or
under
the
rubric
of
advertising
and
by
the
time
you
put
advertising
and
labeling
in
their
broad
definitions
together,
it's
safe
to
say
in
every
piece
of
literature
that
these
drug
companies
ever
get
put
out,
outside
of
their
own
internal
affairs
and
probably
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
some
of
that.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
here
we're
concerned
with
prescription
drugs
and
those
are
the
drugs
you
normally
know
mr.
justice
douglas
as
sold
by
prescription
and
of
course
the
audience
to
which
this
literature
is
directed,
either
advertising
or
labeling
is
to
the
position.
and
not
the
public,
and
what
they're
saying
is
that
every
time
no
matter
what
the
circumstance
we
mentioned
the
brand
name,
we
mustn't
mention
the
generic
name,
no
matter
how
prominently
we
have
made
the
generic
name
in
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
it
will
be
on
that
--
it
will
be
on
that
label.
but
of
course
you
can't
get
that
unless
the
doctor
prescribes
it,
you
can't
go
take
it
off
the
shelf.
it's
not
over
the
counter
product.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
and
sold
only
under
--
not
only
by
pharmacists.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
that's
right.
it
doesn't
apply
to
aspirin
for
example.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
or
things
of
that
kind.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
the
government
tries
to
avoid
the
criminal
case
by
saying
they're
not
going
to
bring
any
even
though
the
statute
lets
them
do
it.
the
solicitor
general
tries
to
duck
under
and
out
on
that.
the
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white
is
yes
but
the
factors
that
lead
us
to
the
view
that
review
is
necessary
now
are
the
desirability
of
uniformity
in
this
industry
and
the
desirability
of
avoiding
the
hazards
and
the
disadvantages
that
come
and
attend
in
publicity
to
come
if
you're
sued
criminally
or
if
all
your
goods
are
involved
in
multiple
seizures.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
would
be
here
making
the
argument
in
the
event
there
was
any
particular
move
by
the
government
against
a
particular
label
or
ad
of
a
particular
company
at
some
particular
time.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
that's
right,
if
they
had
done
that
i
would
be
here.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no
say
they're
going
to
enforce
the
statute
and
they
say
it's
an
enforcement
statute
and
the
regulation
says
shall
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
(voice
overlap)
of
command.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
what
i
say
with
respect
to
that
is
that
the
savings
clause
enabled
us
to
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
well,
there
is
a
--
the
statute
--
is
your
honor
referring
to
section
502
(e)?
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
or
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
or
are
you
referring
to
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes,
there
are
--
under
certain
sections,
there
is
a
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
direct
review
in
a
court
of
appeals.
and
i
thought,
that
what's
your
honor
had
in
mind.
now
that
occurs
where
there
are
factual
issues,
the
provisions
they
talk
about
are
where
there
would
have
been
an
evidentiary
hearing
prior
to
the
rule
making
before
the
board.
and
then
a
review
of
the
factual
basis
upon
which
the
particular
determination
was
made,
the
record
would
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
nothing
of
that
kind
here
at
all.
there're
no
factual
issues.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes.
yes,
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
maybe
i
still
can.
but
certainly,
without
a
special
provisions
for
appeal
or
review
to
a
court
of
appeals,
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
have
put
me
in
the
district
court.
i
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
unless
there's
a
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
any
questions.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
would
like
to
deal
with
two
words
that
have
been
used
this
afternoon
“premature
and
abstract”
and
i'd
like
to
simply
give
you
one
example
of
what
the
government
said
as
the
way
we
should
deal
with
this
problem.
i
suffer
from
gout
mr.
chief
justice
and
others
too,
suppose
the
company
has
developed
a
cure
for
gout
and
the
drug
has
cleared,
they
say
don't
lift
that
drug
on
the
market
because
we
will
not
approve
the
labeling
because
you
don't
have
generic
every
time
and
take
that
up
through
the
courts
for
a
period
of
two
to
two-and
a
half
years
to
get
these
regulations
straightened
out.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
my
answer
to
that
is
very
clear
and
simple.
in
that
context,
you
have
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing,
you
go
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
that's
all
there's
to
it.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
because
the
statute
does
not
cover
a
proceeding
of
this
kind
relating
to
this
type
of
regulation
which
issued
without
any
evidentiary
hearing
which
--
issued
without
any
factual
basis.
it's
an
(inaudible)
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
they
just
say
business
on
what
we
think
the
statute
means.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
you
do
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
case
you
put
to
be
mr.
justice.
right
now,
it's
going
on
in
the
field
of
vitamins
and
you
may
have
seen
in
the
newspapers.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
and
that's
the
type
of
regulation
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
--
that's
the
type
of
regulation
they
issue
on
the
questions
of
help
of
that
kind
after
they
taken
evidence,
after
they
have
heard
from
technical
people
and
after
they
have
a
fix
on
it.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
i
have
dealt
with
the
premature
point.
now,
it
is
--
now
it
is
not
abstract.
mr.
justice
douglas
asked,
what
is
involved
in
seizure?
and
he
was
advised
that
someone
seizes
libel-some
goods,
that
isn't
all
that's
involved.
we've
had
two
reason
seizures
against
drug
companies
banner
headlines
in
the
washington
post,
the
star,
and
all
the
newspapers
of
the
country
press
releases,
background
statements,
these
companies
are
in
the
sensitive
business.
and
the
necessity
of
having
to
meet
that
kind
of
publicity
barrage
or
the
company's
seizure
i
think
is
something
that
creates
a
real
quarrel
and
a
real
problem.
and
as
far
as
multiple
seizures
are
concerned
there
is
plenty
opportunity
here
to
seize
the
drugs
in
any
number
of
company
at
the
same
time,
one
company,
three
companies,
five
companies,
20
companies
and
the
government
is
trying
to
keep
total
chance
to
pick
and
choose
to
move
to
determine
its
strategy
hoping
in
the
meantime
that
by
this
jawbone
enforcement,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested,
people
will
comply
even
though
they
probably
clearly
in
view
with
the
district
judge
have
gone
beyond
the
law.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
there
is
not
mr.
justice
black.
there
is
an
argument
that
congress
precluded
this
type
of
action
even
if
it
is
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
yes.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
right.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
and
we
say
that
they
never
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
the
court
of
appeals
so
ruled.
the
district
judge
ruled
on
the
merits
because
he
found
we
had
a
proper
complaint
for
property
in
court
and
he
said
we
were
right
about
the
regulation.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
not
right
and
that
congress
in
addition
had
precluded
this
type
of
action.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no
sir.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gessell
no,
and
i
don't
--
the
government
indicated
they
have
no
quarrel
with
our
complaints.
it's
a
good
complaint
mr.
justice
black.
