mr.
harold
e.
cole
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
honorable
court.
on
this
manner
of
the
statute
and
whether
or
not
this
is
an
interlocutory
appeal
i
maintain
it's
not
interlocutory
it's
not
interlocutory
at
all
because
if
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
allowed
that
is
the
case.
i
am
going
to
read
from
the
hearing
in
the
district
court.
the
clerk
called
a
case
and
the
court
says,
“does
the
plaintiff
waive
damages
in
this
case?”
mr.
toren
answered,
“yes,
your
honor.”
the
court,
“does
the
plaintiff
waive
attorney's
fees.”
mr.
toren
answers,
“yes,
your
honor.”
the
court
says,
“you
waive
for
it?”
mr.
toren
says,
“yes,
your
honor.”
but
now,
if
the
permanent
injunction
is
granted
by
the
court
of
appeals
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
there's
nothing
more
to
it.
i
don't
see
any
point
in
calling
this
an
interlocutory
appeal
agreeing
that
if
it
were
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
then
and
was
denied
then
he
could
appeal
under
the
statute
but
he's
asking
for
a
permanent
injunction
to
complete
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
and
if
their
decision
is
favored,
that
ends
the
case.
in
connection
with
this
statute,
this
court
has
had
something
to
say
about
it
in
the
city
of
morgan
town,
west
virginia
versus
royal
insurance
company,
376
u.s.
254
60
supreme
court
1067.
the
court
said,
page
258
but
piecemeal
appeals
have
never
been
encouraged.
the
growth
of
the
law
of
procedure
in
the
united
states
during
the
last
half
century
has
been
steadily
in
the
direction
of
simplicity
and
direction
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
appeal
of
order
denied.
in
that
case
i
should
state
that
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
rutledge
did
dissent.
but,
however,
it
dealt
with
this
statute
although
the
matter
was
the
denial
of
a
jury
trial
in
the
district
court.
nevertheless,
it
reached
this
court
and
the
court
refused
to
expand
the
statute.
now,
what
the
plaintiff
petitioner
is
asking
here
is
that
this
court
expand
the
statute
and
include
motions
for
permanent
injunction
that
are
denied
even
though
damages
and
attorneys
fees
are
waived.
that's
what
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
what's
that?
mr.
harold
e.
cole
an
appeal
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
the
--
the
statute
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
yes
but
the
statute
deals
with
interlocutory
appeals.
now,
the
word
interlocutory
has
a
clear
meaning.
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
an
appeal
where
if
it's
decided
the
whole
case
is
it
that
this
isn't
a
case
that
will
go
back
for
damages
ought
to
determine
attorneys
fees
if
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decides
the
case
where
in
it,
where
it
is
completed,
that
is
that
if
they
decide
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
we
never
get
a
trial.
now,
i
want
to
argue
a
little
on
why
congress
never
amended
the
statute
to
provide
for
appeals
when
a
motion
for
permanent
injunction
is
denied.
if
--
well,
we'll
take
the
facts
in
this
case
and
how
abusive
a
process
can
be
in
court.
this
defendant
respondent
is
a
small
retail
meat
dealer
having
two
employees
and
he
has
a
small
meat
stall
in
faneuil
hall
market
at
boston.
he
did
not
receive
any
notice
in
writing
to
stop
using
this
little
sign
imported
swiss
cheese.
he
happens
to
sell
about
15
to
20
pounds
of
cheese
that's
imported
either
from
finland
or
austria.
he
had
to
charge
more
for
imported
swiss
cheese
so
he
merely
put
on
top
of
the
cheese
with
a
little
sign
imported
swiss
cheese
which
is
a
fact,
it's
true,
it
is
imported.
it
came,
i
believe
this
cheese
came
from
austria
but
swiss
cheese
is
the
well-known
term
that
he
was
using
honestly
in
the
dictionary
it's
defined
as
swiss
cheese,
a
firm
pale
yellow
or
white
cheese
containing
many
holes,
made
usually
from
cow's
milk,
half
skimmed.
that's
from
the
american
college
dictionary.
now,
united
states
department
of
agriculture
puts
out
a
book
on
cheeses
and
in
it,
it
defines
swiss
cheese
and
it
says
swiss,
emmentaler
cheese
which
is
a
large,
hard
crust,
curd
cheese
with
an
elastic
body
and
a
mild
nut-like
swedish
flavor.
it's
best
known
because
of
the
holes
or
eyes
that
developed
in
the
curd
as
the
cheese
ripens.
the
eyes
are
often
one
half
to
one
inch
in
diameter
and
so
on.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
swiss
cheese
is
made
in
many
other
countries
beside
switzerland,
including
france,
denmark,
germany,
bulgaria,
italy,
austria,
finland,
russia,
argentina,
and
the
united
states.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
most
of
the
swiss
cheese
is
made
in
wisconsin
but
some
other
countries
also
make
swiss
cheese.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
first
of
all,
i
want
to
point
out
if
you
do
allow
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
how
much
this
split
of
a
case?
what
damage
you
can
do
to
a
poor
defendant.
he
is
a
fellow
with
a
little
market.
he
goes
into
court
because
he
wasn't
given
written
orders.
then
there's
an
appeal,
alright,
if
the
court,
the
circuit
court
denies
the
appeal,
back
it
goes
to
the
district
court
then
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
again
all
over
one
little
word.
he
said
the
cheese
was
imported.
it
is
imported.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
yes,
but
the
point
is
--
here
is
the
way
we
started.
in
november
1963
the
complaint
was
filed.
a
year
and
more
later,
when
the
case
was
nearly
ready
for
trial,
this
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed.
now,
that
keeps
the
case
from
being
tried.
so
we
hear
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
it's
denied.
now,
he
gets
another
year
before
trial.
he
goes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
and
we
used
up
approximately
another
year
getting
up
there
in
briefs
and
so
forth.
now,
i
don't
think
congress
wants
you
to
expand
the
statute
to
include
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
because
of
the
unfairness
and
the
hardship
of
a
little
defendant.
now,
they
are
bringing
this
case
up
or
trying
to
bring
it
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
again
and
have
them
decide
that
the
words
imported
swiss
cheese
mean
(inaudible)
that
is
the
switzerland
swiss
cheese.
it's
a
strange
thing
but
while
this
case
was
going
on
an
advertisement
came
out
in
the
new
york
times
and
the
ladies'
home
journal
in
which
they
said
in
their
ad,
“imported
swiss
cheese
isn't
good
enough
for
you.
insist
on
genuine
switzerland
swiss
cheese.”
they
don't
believe
that
they
had
any
right
in
imported
swiss
cheese
but
they
can
go
on
and
on
with
a
case
like
this.
right
up
one
court
to
another
then
back
to
the
other
court
then
up
to
the
other
court
and
we
can
have
a
trial
after
something
like
three
years
now.
we
can't
even
get
a
trial.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
oh
he
didn't
have
any.
he
didn't
have
any
registration.
he
hasn't
have
any
copyright.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
they
just
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
they
--
when
they
started
the
case,
they
attached
a
lot
of
patent
office,
trademark
registrations
but
that's
been
dropped
long
ago.
we
didn't
infringe
those.
those
trademark
registrations
covered
switzerland
swiss
cheese.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
oh!
he
says
that
the
plaintiff
has
exclusive
rights
in
the
words
imported
swiss
cheese.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
swiss
cheese.
that
if
anyone
uses
the
word
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
they
haven't
done
any.
what
they
say
is
that
in
the
trade,
when
anyone
uses
the
word
imported
swiss
cheese,
they
mean
only
the
plaintiff's
cheese
and
they
put
a
couple
of
affidavits
in.
what
i
am
pointing
out
is
that
same
time
the
lawyers
were
doing
that,
this
advertisement
came
out
in
the
new
york
times
and
the
ladies'
home
journal
saying
that
imported
swiss
cheese
isn't
good
enough
for
you.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
that's
what
they
want.
that's
what
they're
asking
for.
the
sole
argument
in
this
case
in
there
briefs
is
that
is
a
question
presented
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well
maybe
i
don't
understand,
the
court
only
decided
that
they
couldn't
hear
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
motion
for
summary
judgment,
that's
all
they
decided.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
oh
the
district
court
said
it
was
a
question
of
facts.
they
said
a
number
of
facts.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
what's
that?
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
yes.
they
said
it
was
a
question
of
fact.
but
it
seems
the
affidavits
were
contradictory
and
so
they
wouldn't
decide
that
imported
swiss
cheese
means
plain
as
is,
they
wouldn't
decide
that.
they
said
the
affidavits
are
contradictory.
so
there
was
the
end
of
that
part
and
i
think
judge
julian
made
it
clear
several
times
because
he
did
talk
an
awful
lot
as
you
see
in
the
record
about
it
that
it
was
a
question
of
fact
and
he
was
stuck.
he
says
i
can't
issue
a
--
i
can't
grant
you
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
he
refused
so
he
--
judge
julian
is
very
implying
to
grant
the
motion.
if
you
read
in
the
record
here
the
number
of
things
he
said
on
the
subject.
now,
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no
they
don't
have
trademark
on
imported
swiss
cheese.
they
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no,
they
have
none.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no.
what
they
did
they
attached
the
patent
office
trademark
registration
to
the
complaint
to
get
into
the
federal
court.
once
that
they
got
it
in
there
then
they
drop
the
whole
thing.
they
don't
claim
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
except
the
words
imported
swiss
cheese.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
yes,
that's
what
they
said.
it
is
what
he
says
in
his
brief.
petitioner
says
the
exclusive
representatives
of
the
cheese
manufacturers
of
switzerland.
they
alleged
that
respondents
use
of
the
of
the
trade
designation
imported
swiss
cheese
on
non-switzerland
cheese
without
indicating
the
country
origin
of
the
cheese
is
deceptive
and
an
unfair
trademark
practice
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
thank
you.
i
meant
earlier
in
my
argument
to
explain
why
i
asked
that
the
court
dismissed
the
case
on
the
merits
because
there
is
authority
and
i
refer
to
patterson
v.
alabama
294
u.s.
600
page
607.
we
have
frequently
held
that
in
the
exercise
of
our
appellate
jurisdiction,
we
have
power
not
only
to
correct
error
in
the
judgment
under
review
but
to
make
such
disposition
of
the
case
as
justice
requires
and
the
court
has
on
different
occasions
dismiss
the
case.
well,
of
course
we're
anxious
in
that.
i
would
argue
would
be
dismissed
because
all
we're
using
is
the
word
“imported”
and
we
don't
want
to
go
on
from
court
to
court
fighting
for
our
rights.
in
fact
i
better
say
this
that
this
was
a
small
sign
and
when
the
suit
started
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
who
isn't
here
told
his
client
to
take
down
the
sign.
the
sign
hasn't
been
up
since
then
but
what
they
want
is
an
injunction
and
we
aren't
willing
to
have
the
injunction
issue
because
you
make
use
of
an
injunction
naturally
legally
by
advertising
it
so
forth
so
that's
where
our
difference.
we
don't
consider
calling
imported
swiss
cheese,
any
great
event
while
you're
only
selling
only
15
to
20
pounds
a
week
and
actually
we
aren't
doing
it.
now,
i
depended
also
on
a
case
not
in
my
brief
but
your
honors
will
recall
on
that
sears,
roebuck
v.
stiffel
376
u.s.
225.
in
that
case,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
nothing
was
to
be
taken
out
of
the
public
domain
and
given
to
anyone
party.
in
that
case,
it
happen
to
be
a
lamp
that
wasn't
patented
and
they
had
gotten
an
injunction
enjoining
the
defendant
sears
roebuck
from
using
the
lamp
even
though
it
was
patented
and
this
court
made
it
clear
if
there
were
no
statutory
protection
for
that
lamp
either
by
a
design
patent
or
regular
patent
or
a
copyright
that
anyone
who's
free
to
make
it,
in
the
same
holds
here
as
to
the
word
imported.
anyone
is
free
to
use
the
word
imported
if
it's
truthful.
now,
the
code
of
federal
regulation
title
21
chapter
1
defines
in
section
2
swiss
cheese.
i
don't
need
to
read
the
definition
but
in
order
for
the
import
division,
the
treasury
department
to
permit
the
entry
of
cheese
they
defined
swiss
cheese
and
of
course
swiss
cheese
it's
coming
from
all
these
different
countries.
another
thing
i
should
mention
the
defendant
respondent
never
uses
switzerland,
he
never
called
this
cheese
switzerland.
he
never
called
his
cheese
genuine.
all
he
calls
it
is
imported.
another
thing
during
the
hearing
in
fact
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
contain
no
proof
or
advertisement
whatsoever
that
the
plaintiff,
petitioner
here
ever
used
the
words
imported
swiss
cheese
alone
to
describe
its
product.
they
presented
no
advertisement
showing
that.
all
the
advertisements
described
the
product
as
switzerland
swiss
cheese.
now,
coming
to
the
decision
because
while
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
permit
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
summary
judgment
i
think
the
case
of
morgenstern
v.
schering
181
f.2d
160
from
the
third
circuit
is
better
reasoned.
on
page
162
the
court
said
the
denial
of
summary
judgment
in
the
court
below
has
no
comparable
significance.
the
court
has
not
reached
much
less
decided
the
merits
of
plaintiff's
claim
for
injunction.
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
not
an
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
nothing
has
occurred
in
or
as
a
result
of
the
denial
of
the
motion
which
precludes
plaintiff
from
seeking
a
temporary
injunction.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
where
they
did
allow
the
appeal
i
think
you
will
see
the
fallacy
especially
in
judge
frank's
opinion
where
he
said
regarding
the
case
of
contrary
conclusion
by
sheer
ritualism
would
waste
time
for
plaintiff
the
next
minute
after
the
denial
of
the
summary
judgment
motion
could
present
the
same
papers
and
changed
except
for
a
new
label
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
in
other
words,
what
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
what's
that?
mr.
harold
e.
cole
oh
that
was
judge
frank's
case
--
what
--
it's
--
oh
second
circuit.
i
believe
it's
a
federal
glass
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no
this
was
judge
frank.
he
followed
judge
hand
out.
judge
hand
had
the
first
one.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
what's
that?
oh
this
one
here?
the
u.s.c.
276
f.2d
525.276
f.2d
525.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no
that's
judge
frank.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
oh
judge
hand.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
it's
in
the
federal
glass
company
versus
loshin
217
f.2d
936
ca.2.
but
in
the
second
circuit
now,
some
of
the
judges
who
have
been
constrained
to
follow
judge
hand's
and
judge
frank's
decision
said
solely
they
do
it
with
regret
that
they
don't
think
it
was
good
law
but
they
of
course
feel
they
are
bound
to
follow.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
the
third
circuit
now
and
the
first
circuit
deciding
the
case
otherwise.
now,
that
completes
my
argument.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
honorable
court.
on
this
manner
of
the
statute
and
whether
or
not
this
is
an
interlocutory
appeal
i
maintain
it's
not
interlocutory
it's
not
interlocutory
at
all
because
if
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
allowed
that
is
the
case.
i
am
going
to
read
from
the
hearing
in
the
district
court.
the
clerk
called
a
case
and
the
court
says,
“does
the
plaintiff
waive
damages
in
this
case?”
mr.
toren
answered,
“yes,
your
honor.”
the
court,
“does
the
plaintiff
waive
attorney's
fees.”
mr.
toren
answers,
“yes,
your
honor.”
the
court
says,
“you
waive
for
it?”
mr.
toren
says,
“yes,
your
honor.”
but
now,
if
the
permanent
injunction
is
granted
by
the
court
of
appeals
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
there's
nothing
more
to
it.
i
don't
see
any
point
in
calling
this
an
interlocutory
appeal
agreeing
that
if
it
were
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
then
and
was
denied
then
he
could
appeal
under
the
statute
but
he's
asking
for
a
permanent
injunction
to
complete
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
and
if
their
decision
is
favored,
that
ends
the
case.
in
connection
with
this
statute,
this
court
has
had
something
to
say
about
it
in
the
city
of
morgan
town,
west
virginia
versus
royal
insurance
company,
376
u.s.
254
60
supreme
court
1067.
the
court
said,
page
258
but
piecemeal
appeals
have
never
been
encouraged.
the
growth
of
the
law
of
procedure
in
the
united
states
during
the
last
half
century
has
been
steadily
in
the
direction
of
simplicity
and
direction
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
appeal
of
order
denied.
in
that
case
i
should
state
that
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
rutledge
did
dissent.
but,
however,
it
dealt
with
this
statute
although
the
matter
was
the
denial
of
a
jury
trial
in
the
district
court.
nevertheless,
it
reached
this
court
and
the
court
refused
to
expand
the
statute.
now,
what
the
plaintiff
petitioner
is
asking
here
is
that
this
court
expand
the
statute
and
include
motions
for
permanent
injunction
that
are
denied
even
though
damages
and
attorneys
fees
are
waived.
that's
what
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
what's
that?
mr.
harold
e.
cole
an
appeal
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
the
--
the
statute
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
yes
but
the
statute
deals
with
interlocutory
appeals.
now,
the
word
interlocutory
has
a
clear
meaning.
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
an
appeal
where
if
it's
decided
the
whole
case
is
it
that
this
isn't
a
case
that
will
go
back
for
damages
ought
to
determine
attorneys
fees
if
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decides
the
case
where
in
it,
where
it
is
completed,
that
is
that
if
they
decide
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
we
never
get
a
trial.
now,
i
want
to
argue
a
little
on
why
congress
never
amended
the
statute
to
provide
for
appeals
when
a
motion
for
permanent
injunction
is
denied.
if
--
well,
we'll
take
the
facts
in
this
case
and
how
abusive
a
process
can
be
in
court.
this
defendant
respondent
is
a
small
retail
meat
dealer
having
two
employees
and
he
has
a
small
meat
stall
in
faneuil
hall
market
at
boston.
he
did
not
receive
any
notice
in
writing
to
stop
using
this
little
sign
imported
swiss
cheese.
he
happens
to
sell
about
15
to
20
pounds
of
cheese
that's
imported
either
from
finland
or
austria.
he
had
to
charge
more
for
imported
swiss
cheese
so
he
merely
put
on
top
of
the
cheese
with
a
little
sign
imported
swiss
cheese
which
is
a
fact,
it's
true,
it
is
imported.
it
came,
i
believe
this
cheese
came
from
austria
but
swiss
cheese
is
the
well-known
term
that
he
was
using
honestly
in
the
dictionary
it's
defined
as
swiss
cheese,
a
firm
pale
yellow
or
white
cheese
containing
many
holes,
made
usually
from
cow's
milk,
half
skimmed.
that's
from
the
american
college
dictionary.
now,
united
states
department
of
agriculture
puts
out
a
book
on
cheeses
and
in
it,
it
defines
swiss
cheese
and
it
says
swiss,
emmentaler
cheese
which
is
a
large,
hard
crust,
curd
cheese
with
an
elastic
body
and
a
mild
nut-like
swedish
flavor.
it's
best
known
because
of
the
holes
or
eyes
that
developed
in
the
curd
as
the
cheese
ripens.
the
eyes
are
often
one
half
to
one
inch
in
diameter
and
so
on.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
swiss
cheese
is
made
in
many
other
countries
beside
switzerland,
including
france,
denmark,
germany,
bulgaria,
italy,
austria,
finland,
russia,
argentina,
and
the
united
states.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
most
of
the
swiss
cheese
is
made
in
wisconsin
but
some
other
countries
also
make
swiss
cheese.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
first
of
all,
i
want
to
point
out
if
you
do
allow
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
how
much
this
split
of
a
case?
what
damage
you
can
do
to
a
poor
defendant.
he
is
a
fellow
with
a
little
market.
he
goes
into
court
because
he
wasn't
given
written
orders.
then
there's
an
appeal,
alright,
if
the
court,
the
circuit
court
denies
the
appeal,
back
it
goes
to
the
district
court
then
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
again
all
over
one
little
word.
he
said
the
cheese
was
imported.
it
is
imported.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
yes,
but
the
point
is
--
here
is
the
way
we
started.
in
november
1963
the
complaint
was
filed.
a
year
and
more
later,
when
the
case
was
nearly
ready
for
trial,
this
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed.
now,
that
keeps
the
case
from
being
tried.
so
we
hear
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
it's
denied.
now,
he
gets
another
year
before
trial.
he
goes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
and
we
used
up
approximately
another
year
getting
up
there
in
briefs
and
so
forth.
now,
i
don't
think
congress
wants
you
to
expand
the
statute
to
include
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
because
of
the
unfairness
and
the
hardship
of
a
little
defendant.
now,
they
are
bringing
this
case
up
or
trying
to
bring
it
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
again
and
have
them
decide
that
the
words
imported
swiss
cheese
mean
(inaudible)
that
is
the
switzerland
swiss
cheese.
it's
a
strange
thing
but
while
this
case
was
going
on
an
advertisement
came
out
in
the
new
york
times
and
the
ladies'
home
journal
in
which
they
said
in
their
ad,
“imported
swiss
cheese
isn't
good
enough
for
you.
insist
on
genuine
switzerland
swiss
cheese.”
they
don't
believe
that
they
had
any
right
in
imported
swiss
cheese
but
they
can
go
on
and
on
with
a
case
like
this.
right
up
one
court
to
another
then
back
to
the
other
court
then
up
to
the
other
court
and
we
can
have
a
trial
after
something
like
three
years
now.
we
can't
even
get
a
trial.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
oh
he
didn't
have
any.
he
didn't
have
any
registration.
he
hasn't
have
any
copyright.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
they
just
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
they
--
when
they
started
the
case,
they
attached
a
lot
of
patent
office,
trademark
registrations
but
that's
been
dropped
long
ago.
we
didn't
infringe
those.
those
trademark
registrations
covered
switzerland
swiss
cheese.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
oh!
he
says
that
the
plaintiff
has
exclusive
rights
in
the
words
imported
swiss
cheese.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
swiss
cheese.
that
if
anyone
uses
the
word
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
they
haven't
done
any.
what
they
say
is
that
in
the
trade,
when
anyone
uses
the
word
imported
swiss
cheese,
they
mean
only
the
plaintiff's
cheese
and
they
put
a
couple
of
affidavits
in.
what
i
am
pointing
out
is
that
same
time
the
lawyers
were
doing
that,
this
advertisement
came
out
in
the
new
york
times
and
the
ladies'
home
journal
saying
that
imported
swiss
cheese
isn't
good
enough
for
you.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
that's
what
they
want.
that's
what
they're
asking
for.
the
sole
argument
in
this
case
in
there
briefs
is
that
is
a
question
presented
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well
maybe
i
don't
understand,
the
court
only
decided
that
they
couldn't
hear
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
motion
for
summary
judgment,
that's
all
they
decided.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
oh
the
district
court
said
it
was
a
question
of
facts.
they
said
a
number
of
facts.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
what's
that?
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
yes.
they
said
it
was
a
question
of
fact.
but
it
seems
the
affidavits
were
contradictory
and
so
they
wouldn't
decide
that
imported
swiss
cheese
means
plain
as
is,
they
wouldn't
decide
that.
they
said
the
affidavits
are
contradictory.
so
there
was
the
end
of
that
part
and
i
think
judge
julian
made
it
clear
several
times
because
he
did
talk
an
awful
lot
as
you
see
in
the
record
about
it
that
it
was
a
question
of
fact
and
he
was
stuck.
he
says
i
can't
issue
a
--
i
can't
grant
you
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
he
refused
so
he
--
judge
julian
is
very
implying
to
grant
the
motion.
if
you
read
in
the
record
here
the
number
of
things
he
said
on
the
subject.
now,
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no
they
don't
have
trademark
on
imported
swiss
cheese.
they
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no,
they
have
none.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no.
what
they
did
they
attached
the
patent
office
trademark
registration
to
the
complaint
to
get
into
the
federal
court.
once
that
they
got
it
in
there
then
they
drop
the
whole
thing.
they
don't
claim
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
except
the
words
imported
swiss
cheese.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
yes,
that's
what
they
said.
it
is
what
he
says
in
his
brief.
petitioner
says
the
exclusive
representatives
of
the
cheese
manufacturers
of
switzerland.
they
alleged
that
respondents
use
of
the
of
the
trade
designation
imported
swiss
cheese
on
non-switzerland
cheese
without
indicating
the
country
origin
of
the
cheese
is
deceptive
and
an
unfair
trademark
practice
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
thank
you.
i
meant
earlier
in
my
argument
to
explain
why
i
asked
that
the
court
dismissed
the
case
on
the
merits
because
there
is
authority
and
i
refer
to
patterson
v.
alabama
294
u.s.
600
page
607.
we
have
frequently
held
that
in
the
exercise
of
our
appellate
jurisdiction,
we
have
power
not
only
to
correct
error
in
the
judgment
under
review
but
to
make
such
disposition
of
the
case
as
justice
requires
and
the
court
has
on
different
occasions
dismiss
the
case.
well,
of
course
we're
anxious
in
that.
i
would
argue
would
be
dismissed
because
all
we're
using
is
the
word
“imported”
and
we
don't
want
to
go
on
from
court
to
court
fighting
for
our
rights.
in
fact
i
better
say
this
that
this
was
a
small
sign
and
when
the
suit
started
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
who
isn't
here
told
his
client
to
take
down
the
sign.
the
sign
hasn't
been
up
since
then
but
what
they
want
is
an
injunction
and
we
aren't
willing
to
have
the
injunction
issue
because
you
make
use
of
an
injunction
naturally
legally
by
advertising
it
so
forth
so
that's
where
our
difference.
we
don't
consider
calling
imported
swiss
cheese,
any
great
event
while
you're
only
selling
only
15
to
20
pounds
a
week
and
actually
we
aren't
doing
it.
now,
i
depended
also
on
a
case
not
in
my
brief
but
your
honors
will
recall
on
that
sears,
roebuck
v.
stiffel
376
u.s.
225.
in
that
case,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
nothing
was
to
be
taken
out
of
the
public
domain
and
given
to
anyone
party.
in
that
case,
it
happen
to
be
a
lamp
that
wasn't
patented
and
they
had
gotten
an
injunction
enjoining
the
defendant
sears
roebuck
from
using
the
lamp
even
though
it
was
patented
and
this
court
made
it
clear
if
there
were
no
statutory
protection
for
that
lamp
either
by
a
design
patent
or
regular
patent
or
a
copyright
that
anyone
who's
free
to
make
it,
in
the
same
holds
here
as
to
the
word
imported.
anyone
is
free
to
use
the
word
imported
if
it's
truthful.
now,
the
code
of
federal
regulation
title
21
chapter
1
defines
in
section
2
swiss
cheese.
i
don't
need
to
read
the
definition
but
in
order
for
the
import
division,
the
treasury
department
to
permit
the
entry
of
cheese
they
defined
swiss
cheese
and
of
course
swiss
cheese
it's
coming
from
all
these
different
countries.
another
thing
i
should
mention
the
defendant
respondent
never
uses
switzerland,
he
never
called
this
cheese
switzerland.
he
never
called
his
cheese
genuine.
all
he
calls
it
is
imported.
another
thing
during
the
hearing
in
fact
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
contain
no
proof
or
advertisement
whatsoever
that
the
plaintiff,
petitioner
here
ever
used
the
words
imported
swiss
cheese
alone
to
describe
its
product.
they
presented
no
advertisement
showing
that.
all
the
advertisements
described
the
product
as
switzerland
swiss
cheese.
now,
coming
to
the
decision
because
while
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
permit
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
summary
judgment
i
think
the
case
of
morgenstern
v.
schering
181
f.2d
160
from
the
third
circuit
is
better
reasoned.
on
page
162
the
court
said
the
denial
of
summary
judgment
in
the
court
below
has
no
comparable
significance.
the
court
has
not
reached
much
less
decided
the
merits
of
plaintiff's
claim
for
injunction.
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
not
an
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
nothing
has
occurred
in
or
as
a
result
of
the
denial
of
the
motion
which
precludes
plaintiff
from
seeking
a
temporary
injunction.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
where
they
did
allow
the
appeal
i
think
you
will
see
the
fallacy
especially
in
judge
frank's
opinion
where
he
said
regarding
the
case
of
contrary
conclusion
by
sheer
ritualism
would
waste
time
for
plaintiff
the
next
minute
after
the
denial
of
the
summary
judgment
motion
could
present
the
same
papers
and
changed
except
for
a
new
label
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
in
other
words,
what
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
what's
that?
mr.
harold
e.
cole
oh
that
was
judge
frank's
case
--
what
--
it's
--
oh
second
circuit.
i
believe
it's
a
federal
glass
--
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no
this
was
judge
frank.
he
followed
judge
hand
out.
judge
hand
had
the
first
one.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
what's
that?
oh
this
one
here?
the
u.s.c.
276
f.2d
525.276
f.2d
525.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
no
that's
judge
frank.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
well,
oh
judge
hand.
mr.
harold
e.
cole
it's
in
the
federal
glass
company
versus
loshin
