mr.
toren,
i've
been
wondering
why
if
you
were
satisfied,
there
was
no
issue
of
fact
involved
in
this
case
and
it
was
purely
a
question
of
law,
why
didn't
you
submit
your
case
and
ask
for
a
final
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
you
want
to
come
up
on
that
kind
of
a
record
instead
of
a
final
judgment
of
your
--
in
your
case.
was
it
because
you
weren't
satisfied
that
there
was
no
factual
issue
involved
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
advantage
--
what
advantage
do
you
get
by
going
through
this
procedure
which
is
at
least
arguable
instead
of
going
through
the
other
one
which
will
not
be
arguable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer
the
question,
mr.
toren.
