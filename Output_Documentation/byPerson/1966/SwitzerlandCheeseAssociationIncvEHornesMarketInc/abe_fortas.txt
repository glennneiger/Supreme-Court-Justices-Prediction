justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
reality,
does
this
case
involve
anything
more
than
the
question
as
to
whether
this
court
is
going
to
review
and
perhaps
overrule
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
the
case
is
not
right
for
summary
disposition
that
there
is
a
genuine
issue,
a
fact
which
the
court
wants
to
try
out.
is
there
anything
more
before
us
than
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
am
not
asking
you
that.
let's
forget
about
that
aspect
of
it
but
i
have
difficulty
to
state
quite
frankly
saying
where
this
does
involve
a
question
under
the
statute
governing
interlocutory
appeals
in
general.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
involves
the
quite
familiar
question,
questions
quite
familiar
to
lawyers,
a
lot
of
lawyers
anyway
as
to
whether
an
order
denying
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
appealable.
well,
presumably
the
united
states
district
court
felt
rightly
or
wrongly
that
there
was
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
that
was
not
satisfied
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavits
that
had
been
submitted
and
the
thought
that
the
case
should
go
to
trial
and
that
there
should
be
a
decision
after
a
presentation
of
evidence.
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
that
is
the
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
means
--
that
assumes
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
not
question
--
i
don't
mean
to
call
it
a
question
of
law
because
that
assumes
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
a
deceptive
use
of
a
trademark.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
it's
quite
--
the
court
--
the
district
court
wrote
no
opinion
made
no
findings
than
after
most
of
the
summary
judgments
as
i
understand
the
law
whether
it's
quite
possible
that
the
district
court
thought
that
that
was
not
satisfied
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavits
that
the
respondents
use
of
its
mark,
otherwise
deceptive,
and
that
they
wouldn't
have
a
full
trial
and
just
because
you
propose
an
issue
of
law
in
the
district
court
it
does
not
follow,
does
it,
that
the
district
court
had
to
decide
that
issue
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
rather
that
--
it
wrote
no
opinion
and
made
no
findings.
justice
abe
fortas
it
wrote
no
opinion
and
made
no
findings.
all
it
did
was
to
deny
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
isn't
that
right
which
means
in
ordinary
course
that
you'd
have
to
go
trial
and
make
your
proof,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
know
of
any
other
--
of
any
case
on
the
books
other
than
the
decision
of
judge
frank
i
think
is
and
the
second
circuit?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we're
not
trying
--
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
a
ruling
to
the
effect
that
assume
that
the
issue
of
this
trademark
is
deceptive
by
the
respondent
and
you
are
not
entitled
to
relief?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
not
entitled
to
relief,
that's
clear,
isn't
it?
you're
not
entitled
to
relief
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
courts
don't
decide
abstract
questions
of
law.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
court
don't
have
to
agree
with
you.
the
district
court
could
have
said
that
is
not
satisfied
that
this
is
a
deceptive
use
of
a
trademark
and
that
it
wants
the
case
to
go
to
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
didn't
move
after
--
did
you
or
did
you
not
after
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
did
--
was
any
final
judgment
entered
or
did
you
seek
final
judgment?
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
there's
a
very
real
question
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
that
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
seeking
is
something
that
may
be
unknown
to
our
system
of
law.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
i
don't
see
how
a
court
can
give
you
an
injunction
except
in
terms
of
a
fact
of
--
facts
of
particular
cases
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
district
court
did
here
was
may
have
been
to
say
that
i
am
not
satisfied
as
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
you
got
to
go
to
the
trial.
now,
you're
telling
us
now
if
i
correctly
understood
your
last
statement
that
what
you
wanted
was
a
general
declaration
of
the
law
and
without
respect
to
the
respondent's
foreign
practices
here
that
you
can
use
against
the
a&p
and
safeway
and
anybody
else
regardless
of
the
differences
on
the
nuances
and
what
they
call
a
cheese
with
holes
in
it
and
i
know
of
nothing
like
that
in
our
law.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
entirely
up
to
you
to
think
that.
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
suppose
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
felt
that
this
was
an
appealable
order,
what
would
the
court
of
appeals
decide?
justice
abe
fortas
what
issue
would
the
court
of
appeals
decide?
it
wouldn't
just
say
this
is
an
appealable
order.
it's
alright,
this
is
an
appealable
order,
now
what's
the
issue
of
court
would
decide?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
whether
there
are
or
there
are
not,
you
mean
on
the
merits?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
this
and
said
that
there
are
questions
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
suppose
they
did.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
that's
what
he
said
and
he
said
it's
not
appealable
but
you
came
up
from
the
district
court
and
for
reasons
of
your
own,
you
did
not
obtain
the
entry
of
a
final
order
on
the
merits
of
your
case.
you
came
up
from
a
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
abe
fortas
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
may
be
denied
without
passing
on
the
merits
of
the
case
if
the
judge
concludes
that
there
are
genuine
issues
of
fact,
isn't
that
right?
and
for
all
that
we
know
and
hope
you'll
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
about
this
as
i
understand
this
case,
for
all
that
we
know
and
the
district
judge
have
planned
to
pass
on
your
motion
for
summary
judgment,
decline
to
grant
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
because
the
district
judge
thought
that
there
were
genuine
issues
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
for
most
circumstances,
a
court
of
appeals
would
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
there
were
or
were
not
genuine
issues
of
fact.
that's
the
first
question
that
it
has
to
decide.
courts
of
appeals
don't
usually
supersede
the
district
court
in
passing
on
the
merits
of
a
matter
before
the
district
court
has
passed
on
it
in
circumstances
where
the
district
court
has
properly
declined
to
pass
on
the
merits
because
there
are
remaining
issues
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
of
course.
justice
abe
fortas
because
there's
no
final
disposi
--
there
was
no
judgment
by
the
district
court
passing
on
the
merits
of
your
claim.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
my
system
of
jurisprudence,
courts
of
appeals
as
i
understand
it
ordinarily
defer
to
district
courts
and
expect
the
district
court
to
pass
on
issues
before
they
are
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
so
far
as
i
know
the
only
issue
that
the
district
court
did
pass
on
was
whether
there
were
or
not
genuine
issues
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us,
were
there
briefs?
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
briefs
submitted
on
the
merits?
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
briefs
submitted
on
the
merits?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
chief
judge
aldrich
and
sitting
with
judge
hamlin
and
circuit
judge
mccarthy
said
they
didn't
want
to
hear
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
you
said
that
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
says
that
this
is
a
question
of
law.
justice
abe
fortas
page
48
of
the
record
there
is
the
judge's
order
which
clearly
recites
motion
denied
after
hearing.
then
what
are
you
talking
about?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
read
the
next
two
lines.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
on
page
apart
from
the
fourth
saying
it's
a
matter
of
law,
then
on
page
43,
i
draw
your
attention
to
the
third
--
fourth
paragraph
and
the
court
said,
well
the
question
before
me
is
whether
or
not
there
is
any
genuine
dispute
as
to
any
material
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
reality,
does
this
case
involve
anything
more
than
the
question
as
to
whether
this
court
is
going
to
review
and
perhaps
overrule
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
the
case
is
not
right
for
summary
disposition
that
there
is
a
genuine
issue,
a
fact
which
the
court
wants
to
try
out.
is
there
anything
more
before
us
than
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
am
not
asking
you
that.
let's
forget
about
that

of
it

appealable.
well,
presumably

district
court
felt
rightly
or
wrongly
that
there
was
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
that
was
not

to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavits
that
had
been
submitted
and
the
thought
that
the
case
should
go
to
trial
and
that
there
should
be
a
decision
after
a
presentation
of
evidence.
am
i

that
that
is
the
situation?

fortas
why?
justice

that
means

that

justice
abe
fortas

it's
not

i
don't

on
the
merits
of
your
claim.
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
my
system
of
jurisprudence,
courts
of
appeals
as
i
understand
it
ordinarily
defer
to
district
courts
and
expect
the
district
court
to
pass
on
issues
before
they
are
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
so
far
as
i
know
the
only
issue
that
the
district
court
did
pass
on
was
whether
there
were
or
not
genuine
issues
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us,
were
there
briefs?
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
briefs
submitted
on
the
merits?
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
briefs
submitted
on
the
merits?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
chief
judge
aldrich
and
sitting
with
judge
hamlin
and
circuit
judge
mccarthy
said
they
didn't
want
to
hear
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
you
said
that
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
says
that
this
is
a
question
of
law.
justice
abe
fortas
page
48
of
the
record
there
is
the
judge's
order
which
clearly
recites
motion
denied
after
hearing.
then
what
are
you
talking
about?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
read
the
next
two
lines.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
on
page
apart
from
the
fourth
saying
it's
a
matter
of
law,
then
on
page
43,
i
draw
your
attention
to
the
third
--
fourth
paragraph
and
the
court
said,
well
the
question
before
me
is
whether
or
not
there
is
any
genuine
dispute
as
to
any
material
of
fact.
