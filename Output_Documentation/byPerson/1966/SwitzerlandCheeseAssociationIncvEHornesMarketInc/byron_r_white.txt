justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
something
not
to
be
tried
out
of
the
court.
let's
assume
that
we
--
let's
assume
that
we
turned
you
down
here
that
you
did
not
win
here,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
have
to
hear
anything
more,
is
the
case
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
is
there
to
be
tried
if
the
dispositive
issue
of
law
has
already
been
decided
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
understood
what
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
you
win
then?
how
can
you
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
there
are
some
disputed
issues
of
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
are
you
going
to
hear?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
the
court
is
absolutely
right,
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
absolutely
right
when
it
said
that
the
district
court
merely
held
that
an
issue
of
fact
making
summary
judgment
inappropriate.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
district
court
judge
also
said
the
only
question
before
me
is
whether
or
not
there
is
any
genuine
dispute
as
to
any
material
fact,
that's
on
page
44
and
stated
again
on
page
47.
if
there's
a
genuine
dispute
of
any
material
fact
i
cannot
overrule
the
objection
of
another
party.
that's
what
district
court
said
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
if
there
is
no
issue
of
fact
left
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
this
is
anything
to
be
tried
out.
what
would
you
call
witnesses
too
if
there
are
those
issues
of
facts
in
the
case.
everybody
has
agreed
on
the
facts.
what
--
what
would
you
get
witnesses
to
testify
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
we
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
think
--
if
you
think
it's
--
if
you
really
think
it's
only
a
question
of
law,
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
it's
absolutely
correct
and
i
think
the
case
is
over
except
for
getting
a
decent
appeal
on
an
issue
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
could
have
gotten
a
review
on
that,
you
wouldn't
have
ignored
it
if
you
have
said
instead
of
taking
an
appeal
from
--
on
the
what
you
call
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
denial
injunction,
an
appeal
under
merits,
could
you
say
well,
the
case
is
over
please
enter
a
primary
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
i
don't
know
about
that
suppose
because
that
hasn't
happen.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
--
but
wouldn't
you
--
why
don't
say
here
which
i
really
understand
you
are
saying
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
why
the
district
court
turned
down
the
summary
judgment
whether
it
was
because
of
an
untried
issue
of
fact
or
because
he
ruled
against
you
on
a
dispositive
issue
of
law.
it
doesn't
make
a
bit
of
difference
under
the
statute
on
appealability
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then
what
part
of
argument
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
--
but
your
position
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
this
is
the
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
the
trial
judge
says
what
there's
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
here
and
i
am
going
to
turn
down
summary
judgment
and
you
say,
yes
that's
exactly
why
he
did
it.
you
still
would
say
you're
entitled
to
an
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
go
that
far.
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

is
there
something
not

be

well,
that's

white
well,
how
can
you
win
then?
how
can
you
win?
justice
byron

white
well,
you
mean
there
are
some
disputed
issues
of
fact?
justice
byron

what
