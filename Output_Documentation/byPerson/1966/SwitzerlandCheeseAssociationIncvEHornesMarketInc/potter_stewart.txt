but
even
if
--
let's
assume
that
mr.
justice
fortas
is
correct
in
his
premise
and
it's
your
mistake
in
disagreeing
with
him
and
that
what
the
district
court
--
certainly
what
he
--
what
the
district
court
could
have
based
this
decision
on
was
his
finding
that
there
are
disputed
issues
of
material
facts.
certainly,
that's
true,
isn't
it?

stewart
the
question
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
this
statute,
that's
the
question
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart

mr.
fortas
--
justice
fortas
is
entirely
correct
in
saying
i
should
think
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
does
have
jurisdiction,
the
very
first
question
it's
going
to
consider
on
appeal
is
whether
or
not
there
were
disputed
issues
of
material
fact,
and
if
they
were
the
district
judge
regardless
of
what
he
might
have
said
in
colloquy
about
the
law,
he
was
quite
right
in
denying
the
summary
judgment
for
final
injunction,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart

that's
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
if
it

jurisdiction

you
tell
us
it
has
under
the
statute.
justice

was
there
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
