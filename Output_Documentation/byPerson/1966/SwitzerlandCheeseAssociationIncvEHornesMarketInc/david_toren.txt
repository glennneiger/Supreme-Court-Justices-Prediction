mr.
david
toren
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
a
jurisdictional
one
that
has
long
vexed
the
court
of
appeals
and
has
caused
to
deter
the
event.
it
reaches
the
court
on
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit
and
involves
interpretation
of
that
section
of
the
judicial
code
which
states
and
i
quote,
“the
courts
of
appeal
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
appeal
from
interlocutory
orders
of
the
district
court
refusing
injunction.”
the
question
here
is
whether
this
language
authorizes
an
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
order
which
refused
a
permanent
injunction
prayed
for
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
plain,
simple
and
unconditional
in
authorizing
appeals
from
refusals
of
injunction
for
all
purposes.
we
therefore
urge
the
court
to
answer
the
court
in
the
affirmative.
we
do
not
prevent
the
issue
as
an
abstract
proposition
but
rather
in
the
context
of
a
cause
in
regard
to
which
the
refusal
of
the
injunction
has
a
far
reaching
and
drastic
effect
on
the
business
and
rights
of
these
petitioners.
petitioners
are
the
exclusive
representatives
of
the
cheese
producing
community
of
switzerland
which
for
many
centuries
has
produced
quality
cheese
which
is
famous
for
its
excellence
throughout
the
western
world
including
the
united
states.
this
cheese
is
generally
and
universally
known
outside
switzerland
as
imported
swiss
cheese
and
has
been
marketed
under
this
name
by
these
petitioners
for
many
decades
in
the
united
states.
the
respondent,
a
boston
cheese
trader,
sells
as
imported
swiss
cheese
an
inferior,
imitative,
less
expensive
swiss-type
cheese
product
originating
from
finland
or
austria
without
informing
the
public
that
the
cheese
in
fact
comes
from
these
countries.
this
conduct
is
infringement
of
our
rights.
it
dilutes
our
trade
name.
it
confuses
the
public.
it
lessens
the
goodwill
which
has
been
built
up
for
the
trade
name
and
the
cheese
and
of
course
it
causes
financial
loss
to
these
petitioners.
accordingly,
by
way
of
summary
judgment
procedure,
we
move
for
a
permanent
injunction
enjoining
this
respondent
from
using
our
trade
name
on
non-switzerland
cheese,
unless
and
that
is
important,
the
respondent
at
the
same
time
indicates
the
country
of
origin
of
the
cheese.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
asking
for
permanent
injunction
for
all
purposes.
what
we
want
is
that
this
respondent
when
he
sells
imported
swiss
cheese,
he
should
indicate
where
the
cheese
comes
from.
the
motion
was
denied
without
opinion
by
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts.
we
then
appeal
to
the
first
circuit
pursuant
to
section
1292
which
as
stated
before
authorizes
appeals
from
interlocutory
orders
refusing
injunction.
when
we
answered
the
calendar
call,
last
fall,
the
chief
judge
of
the
first
circuit,
dismissed
the
appeal
for
want
of
jurisdiction
and
refused
to
hear
oral
argument.
this
court
then
granted
certiorari.
in
dismissing
the
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit
made
the
following
statement
which
is
if
i
may
say
the
key
sentence
of
the
opinion.
i
quote,
“because
of
a
general
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals,
statutes
permitting
interlocutory
appeals
ought
to
be
construed
with
some
strict
rules.
on
this
basis,
whatever
may
be
the
exact
letter
the
spirit
of
section
1292
is
against
plaintiff's
position.
mr.
david
toren
may
it
please,
your
honor.
the
question
which
has
been
presented
on
certiorari
is
limited
exactly
to
the
proposition
your
honor
just
outlined.
now,
my
learned
friend
here
in
his
brief
has
urged
the
court
to
dispose
of
the
subject
matter
pursuant
of
the
matter
and
should
limit
itself
to
the
question
--
mr.
david
toren
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
i
have
to
disagree.
mr.
david
toren
the
question
involved
here
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
a
question
of
law
to
which
in
our
original
motion
for
summary
judgment
we
raised
a
legal
proposition.
we
said
that
an
international
convention
for
the
protection
of
industrial
property
which
is
implemented
in
the
lanham
act,
the
trademark
statute
which
prohibits
unfair
competition
and
deceptive
misuse
of
famous
trade
name.
now,
that
was
the
basis
of
our
motion.
mr.
david
toren
that's
not
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
david
toren
right.
mr.
david
toren
the
district
court
conceded
that
it
was
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
david
toren
sorry?
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
oh,
yes,
the
leading
case
is
federal
glass
company
v.
loshin
which
has
been
dealt
with
at
great
length
in
our
brief
that
the
circuit
judge
learned
hand.
we
said
that
there's
much
more
decided
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
than
simply
pushing
the
case
back
to
trial
because
he
said,
it
says
a
question
of
law
involved
--
mr.
david
toren
and
the
judge
said,
it
denies
it
and
then
he
had
said
as
a
matter
of
law
you
are
not
entitled
to
your
remedy
to
your
injunction
and
that's
exactly
is
the
present
case.
we
say
--
mr.
david
toren
i
think
there
was
a
ruling
that
i
am
not
entitled
to
relief
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
let's
say
--
mr.
david
toren
well,
we
say
it
isn't
abstract
because
we
have
a
statute
and
the
treaty.
mr.
david
toren
right
but
it
didn't
--
mr.
david
toren
no,
your
honor
but
we
construed
this
as
a
final
judgment.
mr.
david
toren
we
construed
this
order
which
denied
the
permanent
injunction
as
a
final
judgment
and
if
i
may
explain
to
you
i
--
mr.
david
toren
now,
your
honor,
my
question
--
why
we
go
to
the
trouble
of
petitioning
for
a
writ
instead
of
going
back
to
the
district
court
in
trying
the
case.
well,
the
answer
is
very
simple,
your
honor.
the
trade
in
general
is
honest
respects
our
trade
name
and
they
have
no
quarrel
with
the
trade
as
a
whole.
however,
there
are
few
retailers
like
the
present
respondent
who
try
to
take
advantage
of
our
trade
name
which
has
a
tremendous
goodwill
by
selling
inferior,
less
expensive
cheese
product
under
our
trade
name
without
telling
the
public
where
the
cheese
comes
from.
now,
we
feel
if
we
have
a
--
from
the
federal
court
a
permanent
injunction
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
distinguished
from
an
injunction
which
has
resulted
from
a
trial,
we
have
a
better
weapon
to
defend
ourselves
against
all
these
retailers
otherwise
we
will
have
to
try
that
case
maybe
10
times.
mr.
david
toren
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
language
of
the
statute
is
so
plain
and
clear
it
permits
for
one
interpretation
only.
the
statute
says
the
courts
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
appeal
from
interlocutory
orders
refusing
injunction.
there's
no
distinction
between
a
preliminary
injunction
or
a
permanent
injunction.
it
says
simple
language.
and
in
fact
there
are
about
15
cases
--
mr.
david
toren
that's
right.
no
oral
argument
--
mr.
david
toren
they
didn't
reach
it.
the
chief
judge
wouldn't
be
onset,
the
calendar
calls
it
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction
and
in
his
opinion
the
chief
judge
said
he
disagreed
with
the
federal
glass
case
which
is
a
second
circuit
and
he
disagreed
the
case
as
mr.
justice
fortas
mentioned
that
is
united
states
versus
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
where
circuit
judge
friendly
and
judge
frank
said
what
mr.
justice
fortas
said.
now,
the
issue
was
never
reached
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit
and
we
feel
that
we're
entitled
to
go
there
because
the
statute
is
clear.
mr.
david
toren
i
have
no
objection
if
the
court
rules
on
the
matters
of
the
case
as
my
learned
friend
has
urged
in
his
brief
but
we
haven't
asked
for
it.
mr.
david
toren
i
would
be
very
much
surprised
if
you
did.
mr.
david
toren
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
no
that's
all
i
want.
the
question
is
presented
in
our
petition
in
our
brief
exactly
say
that.
mr.
david
toren
no.
i
would
then
go
back
to
the
trial
court,
to
the
district
court
to
try
the
case.
mr.
david
toren
well,
have
there?
mr.
david
toren
we
say
as
a
question
law,
it
has
been
decided
they
gave
us
those
but
not
if
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
david
toren
well,
i
could
bring
in
the
50
witnesses
and
the
market
--
mr.
david
toren
no,
there
are
not.
mr.
david
toren
there
is
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
which
has
been
raised
by
the
respondent
when
he
says
--
mr.
david
toren
no,
that
is
wrong,
it's
an
incorrect
statement.
we
have
pointed
that
out
in
our
brief.
the
district
court
judge
said
that
is
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
david
toren
your
honor,
we
say
there
is
no
fact
which
is
(inaudible)
that
is
our
contention.
we
say
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
treaty
and
the
statute
rules
in
our
favor,
counts
us
to
be
entitled
to
this
injunction.
now,
the
court
has
turned
us
down
for
reasons
i
do
not
know
because
there
was
no
opinion
rendered
by
the
district
court
judge.
all
that
he
admitted
at
one
point
during
the
argument
that
the
question
of
the
treaty
and
the
statute
that
is
the
matter
of
law
so
i
have
a
right
to
--
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
if
i
only
may
disagree
with
the
statement
that
the
district
court
did
not
say
--
mr.
david
toren
yes.
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
well,
your
honor,
the
defendant
has
completely
ignored
the
legal
issue
in
the
proceedings
below
and
has
said
this
is
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
david
toren
suppose
the
judge
wouldn't
do
that.
suppose
the
judge
would
have
said
well
i
think
that
case
should
be
tried
because
my
learned
friend
here
said
there
are
some
people
who
--
mr.
david
toren
it's
only
speculative.
i
don't
know
how
this
--
mr.
david
toren
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
i
don't
know.
mr.
justice
fortas
started
it.
mr.
david
toren
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever.
mr.
david
toren
right.
the
statute
says
--
mr.
david
toren
yes.
appeals
from
refusals
of
injunctions
are
allowed.
well,
an
injunction
has
been
refused
so
i
can
appeal,
it's
that
simple.
mr.
david
toren
if
i
may
develop
my
argument
on
that
point,
we
concede
that
interlocutory
appeals
are
not
looked
upon
this
favor.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
but
we
feel
that
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
is
fallacious
and
unsound
for
three
reasons.
one,
it
ignores
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
two,
it
ignores
the
plain
wording
and
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
three
it
is
against
the
very
purpose
of
summary
judgment.
now,
in
respect
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
purpose
of
section
1292
is
to
create
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
finality
that
has
been
previously
recognized
by
this
court,
mr.
justice
fortas
and
i
refer
you
to
baltimore
contractors
versus
bodinger
which
was
decided
in
1954
and
the
court
expressly
stated
that
this
section,
section
1292
is
an
expressed
exception
to
the
rule
of
finality.
now,
the
legislative
history
does
not
shed
any
light
on
the
reasons
why
congress
modified
the
rules
of
finality
in
respect
to
interlocutory
appeal.
but
this
court
in
devoting
our
case
which
i
referred
state
it
and
i
quote,
“the
changes
seem
plainly
to
spring
from
a
developing
need
to
permit
litigants
to
effectually
challenge
interlocutory
orders
of
serious,
perhaps
irreparable
consequence.”
mr.
david
toren
i
didn't
think
i
have
to,
your
honor.
i
have
a
statute
which
i
can
appeal
from
the
refusal
of
the
injunction.
mr.
david
toren
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
i
must
confess
your
honor
when
that
matter
came
up,
there
was
not
a
slightest
doubt
in
our
mind
that
that
this
is
an
appealable
order.
the
plain
clear
meaning
of
the
statute
says
that
i
can
appeal
from
the
refusal
of
an
injunction.
what
else
do
i
need?
why
should
i
go
through
additional
procedural
if
the
statute
tells
me
i
can
appeal?
mr.
david
toren
i
have
the
circuit
against
us
but
i
have
an
overwhelming
--
mr.
david
toren
well,
i
have
the
fifth
circuit
on
my
side
that
the
international
forwarding
case
and
i
have
the
statute.
what
else
do
i
need?
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
if
i
may
disagree
in
respect
i
think
the
points
raised
by
your
honor
completely
ignore
the
statute.
mr.
david
toren
pardon,
i
didn't
--
mr.
david
toren
the
issue
for
the
court
of
appeals
is
whether
or
not
the
motion
was
denied
correctly
or
incorrectly.
mr.
david
toren
on
the
merits
sure.
it
never
reached
the
merits
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
toren
but
that's
not
what
the
court
said.
mr.
david
toren
the
chief
justice
went
up
and
said
dismissed.
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
toren
your
honor.
your
honor
will
agree
with
me
that
if
the
district
court
would
have
granted
a
motion,
he
would
have
had
a
final
judgment,
a
final
order
appealable
under
section
1291.
mr.
david
toren
but
then
now
--
suppose
now
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
held
that
motion
should
not
have
been
granted
because
there
were
issues
of
facts,
now
the
respondent
to
it
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
appeal.
now,
why
should
we
be
in
the
worst
position?
in
fact,
--
mr.
david
toren
there
was
the
statute
that
say
i
can
appeal.
mr.
david
toren
but,
i
disagree
with
that
your
honor
because
the
district
court
judge
said
this
is
a
matter
of
law
and
this
is
a
forum.
mr.
david
toren
okay,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
--
mr.
david
toren
perfect.
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
no,
your
honor.
what
happened
was
one
of
our
counselor
sitting
in
the
chamber
as
the
case
was
called
and
it's
supposed
to
tell
the
time
of
argument
so
our
men
went
up
and
said
one
hour
argument
so
the
chief
judge
says,
case
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
that's
it
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
and
then
came
an
opinion.
mr.
david
toren
without
any
argument.
now
we
feel
that
that
this
was
correct.
mr.
david
toren
oh
yes.
mr.
david
toren
pardon?
mr.
david
toren
on
the
merits.
mr.
david
toren
that's
correct.
now
in
our
brief,
we
argued
the
appealability
of
the
order
but
not
only
as
an
auxiliary
matter
because
we
sought
that
was
more
or
less
clear
cut.
mr.
david
toren
no.
mr.
david
toren
that's
correct.
mr.
david
toren
if
i
may
refer
your
honor
to
our
brief.
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
i
quote
from
the
record
pages
47
and
48
and
i
read
from
the
brief.
mr.
toren,
that's
me,
“now
the
second
point
was
the
international
conventional
of
the
lanham
act.
it
hasn't
even
been
mentioned
in
mr.
cole's
brief.”
mr.
cole,
for
the
respondent,
now,
that
means
he
has
not
attacked
it.
the
court,
“apparently,
he
takes
the
position
that
it
is
not
conclusive.”
that
is
the
position
he
takes
from
what
he
said
mr.
toren
but
that
is
not
a
matter
of
genuine
issue
of
fact
if
he
simply
says
with
the
court
that
is
the
matter
of
law.
mr.
david
toren
yes.
mr.
toren,
this
is
a
matter
of
law,
the
court,
if
you
what
you
claim
is
so.
mr.
david
toren
now
from
this
i
can
--
i
can
infer
--
mr.
david
toren
oh!
yes,
i
know
that.
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
that
motion
was
denied
because
of
an
outstanding
matter
of
fact
or
an
outstanding
matter
of
law.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
we
have
a
statute
which
permit
appeals
some
refusals
of
injunction
whatever
the
reason.
mr.
chief
justice
my
time
is
up
but
--
mr.
david
toren
thank
you.
i
haven't
been
able
to
present
my
argument
if
i
may
so.
so
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law.
the
statute
is
abundantly
clear,
its
plain
meaning,
its
plain
language
is
the
court
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
from
appeal
from
interlocutory
orders
refusing
injunction.
here
we
have
an
order
which
refused
an
injunction
well
then
therefore
within
the
statute.
now,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
court
below
admitted
that
we
are
within
the
exact
letter
of
the
statute
but
the
court
says
that
the
spirit
of
the
statute
is
against
us.
now,
what
does
it
mean?
that
means,
if
you
read
the
statute
literally,
our
appeal
has
to
be
allowed.
but
literal
reading
is
taboo
because
of
the
general
policy
against
interlocutory
appeals.
that
means
the
fifth
circuit
spurns
the
meaning
of
the
language,
the
plain
meaning
in
favor
of
a
doctrine
for
which
this
statute
is
the
exception.
i
submit
that
this
is
the
most
unpersuasive
reason
to
ignore
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
request
some
additional
time?
mr.
david
toren
thank
you.
mr.
david
toren
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
a
jurisdictional
one
that
has
long
vexed
the
court
of
appeals
and
has
caused
to
deter
the
event.
it
reaches
the
court
on
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit
and
involves
interpretation
of
that
section
of
the
judicial
code
which
states
and
i
quote,
“the
courts
of
appeal
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
appeal
from
interlocutory
orders
of
the
district
court
refusing
injunction.”
the
question
here
is
whether
this
language
authorizes
an
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
order
which
refused
a
permanent
injunction
prayed
for
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
plain,
simple
and
unconditional
in
authorizing
appeals
from
refusals
of
injunction
for
all
purposes.
we
therefore
urge
the
court
to
answer
the
court
in
the
affirmative.
we
do
not
prevent
the
issue
as
an
abstract
proposition
but
rather
in
the
context
of
a
cause
in
regard
to
which
the
refusal
of
the
injunction
has
a
far
reaching
and
drastic
effect
on
the
business
and
rights
of
these
petitioners.
petitioners
are
the
exclusive
representatives
of
the
cheese
producing
community
of
switzerland
which
for
many
centuries
has
produced
quality
cheese
which
is
famous
for
its
excellence
throughout
the
western
world
including
the
united
states.
this
cheese
is
generally
and
universally
known
outside
switzerland
as
imported
swiss
cheese
and
has
been
marketed
under
this
name
by
these
petitioners
for
many
decades
in
the
united
states.
the
respondent,
a
boston
cheese
trader,
sells
as
imported
swiss
cheese
an
inferior,
imitative,
less
expensive
swiss-type
cheese
product
originating
from
finland
or
austria
without
informing
the
public
that
the
cheese
in
fact
comes
from
these
countries.
this
conduct
is
infringement
of
our
rights.
it
dilutes
our
trade
name.
it
confuses
the
public.
it
lessens
the
goodwill
which
has
been
built
up
for
the
trade
name
and
the
cheese
and
of
course
it
causes
financial
loss
to
these
petitioners.
accordingly,
by
way
of
summary
judgment
procedure,
we
move
for
a
permanent
injunction
enjoining
this
respondent
from
using
our
trade
name
on
non-switzerland
cheese,
unless
and
that
is
important,
the
respondent
at
the
same
time
indicates
the
country
of
origin
of
the
cheese.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
asking
for
permanent
injunction
for
all
purposes.
what
we
want
is
that
this
respondent
when
he
sells
imported
swiss
cheese,
he
should
indicate
where
the
cheese
comes
from.
the
motion
was
denied
without
opinion
by
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts.
we
then
appeal
to
the
first
circuit
pursuant
to
section
1292
which
as
stated
before
authorizes
appeals
from
interlocutory
orders
refusing
injunction.
when
we
answered
the
calendar
call,
last
fall,
the
chief
judge
of
the
first
circuit,
dismissed
the
appeal
for
want
of
jurisdiction
and
refused
to
hear
oral
argument.
this
court
then
granted
certiorari.
in
dismissing
the
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit
made
the
following
statement
which
is
if
i
may
say
the
key
sentence
of
the
opinion.
i
quote,
“because
of
a
general
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals,
statutes
permitting
interlocutory
appeals
ought
to
be
construed
with
some
strict
rules.
on
this
basis,
whatever
may
be
the
exact
letter
the
spirit
of
section
1292
is
against
plaintiff's
position.
mr.
david
toren
may
it
please,
your
honor.
the
question
which
has
been
presented
on
certiorari
is
limited
exactly
to
the
proposition
your
honor
just
outlined.
now,
my
learned
friend
here
in
his
brief
has
urged
the
court
to
dispose
of
the
subject
matter
pursuant
of
the
matter
and
should
limit
itself
to
the
question
--
mr.
david
toren
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
i
have
to
disagree.
mr.
david
toren
the
question
involved
here
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
a
question
of
law
to
which
in
our
original
motion
for
summary
judgment
we
raised
a
legal
proposition.
we
said
that
an
international
convention
for
the
protection
of
industrial
property
which
is
implemented
in
the
lanham
act,
the
trademark
statute
which
prohibits
unfair
competition
and
deceptive
misuse
of
famous
trade
name.
now,
that
was
the
basis
of
our
motion.
mr.
david
toren
that's
not
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
david
toren
right.
mr.
david
toren
the
district
court
conceded
that
it
was
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
david
toren
sorry?
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
oh,
yes,
the
leading
case
is
federal
glass
company
v.
loshin
which
has
been
dealt
with
at
great
length
in
our
brief
that
the
circuit
judge
learned
hand.
we
said
that
there's
much
more
decided
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
than
simply
pushing
the
case
back
to
trial
because
he
said,
it
says
a
question
of
law
involved
--
mr.
david
toren
and
the
judge
said,
it
denies
it
and
then
he
had
said
as
a
matter
of
law
you
are
not
entitled
to
your
remedy
to
your
injunction
and
that's
exactly
is
the
present
case.
we
say
--
mr.
david
toren
i
think
there
was
a
ruling
that
i
am
not
entitled
to
relief
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
let's
say
--
mr.
david
toren
well,
we
say
it
isn't
abstract
because
we
have
a
statute
and
the
treaty.
mr.
david
toren
right
but
it
didn't
--
mr.
david
toren
no,
your
honor
but
we
construed
this
as
a
final
judgment.
mr.
david
toren
we
construed
this
order
which
denied
the
permanent
injunction
as
a
final
judgment
and
if
i
may
explain
to
you
i
--
mr.
david
toren
now,
your
honor,
my
question
--
why
we
go
to
the
trouble
of
petitioning
for
a
writ
instead
of
going
back
to
the
district
court
in
trying
the
case.
well,
the
answer
is
very
simple,
your
honor.
the
trade
in
general
is
honest
respects
our
trade
name
and
they
have
no
quarrel
with
the
trade
as
a
whole.
however,
there
are
few
retailers
like
the
present
respondent
who
try
to
take
advantage
of
our
trade
name
which
has
a
tremendous
goodwill
by
selling
inferior,
less
expensive
cheese
product
under
our
trade
name
without
telling
the
public
where
the
cheese
comes
from.
now,
we
feel
if
we
have
a
--
from
the
federal
court
a
permanent
injunction
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
distinguished
from
an
injunction
which
has
resulted
from
a
trial,
we
have
a
better
weapon
to
defend
ourselves
against
all
these
retailers
otherwise
we
will
have
to
try
that
case
maybe
10
times.
mr.
david
toren
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
language
of
the
statute
is
so
plain
and
clear
it
permits
for
one
interpretation
only.
the
statute
says
the
courts
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
appeal
from
interlocutory
orders
refusing
injunction.
there's
no
distinction
between
a
preliminary
injunction
or
a
permanent
injunction.
it
says
simple
language.
and
in
fact
there
are
about
15
cases
--
mr.
david
toren
that's
right.
no
oral
argument
--
mr.
david
toren
they
didn't
reach
it.
the
chief
judge
wouldn't
be
onset,
the
calendar
calls
it
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction
and
in
his
opinion
the
chief
judge
said
he
disagreed
with
the
federal
glass
case
which
is
a
second
circuit
and
he
disagreed
the
case
as
mr.
justice
fortas
mentioned
that
is
united
states
versus
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
where
circuit
judge
friendly
and
judge
frank
said
what
mr.
justice
fortas
said.
now,
the
issue
was
never
reached
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit
and
we
feel
that
we're
entitled
to
go
there
because
the
statute
is
clear.
mr.
david
toren
i
have
no
objection
if
the
court
rules
on
the
matters
of
the
case
as
my
learned
friend
has
urged
in
his
brief
but
we
haven't
asked
for
it.
mr.
david
toren
i
would
be
very
much
surprised
if
you
did.
mr.
david
toren
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
no
that's
all
i
want.
the
question
is
presented
in
our
petition
in
our
brief
exactly
say
that.
mr.
david
toren
no.
i
would
then
go
back
to
the
trial
court,
to
the
district
court
to
try
the
case.
mr.
david
toren
well,
have
there?
mr.
david
toren
we
say
as
a
question
law,
it
has
been
decided
they
gave
us
those
but
not
if
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
david
toren
well,
i
could
bring
in
the
50
witnesses
and
the
market
--
mr.
david
toren
no,
there
are
not.
mr.
david
toren
there
is
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
which
has
been
raised
by
the
respondent
when
he
says
--
mr.
david
toren
no,
that
is
wrong,
it's
an
incorrect
statement.
we
have
pointed
that
out
in
our
brief.
the
district
court
judge
said
that
is
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
david
toren
your
honor,
we
say
there
is
no
fact
which
is
(inaudible)
that
is
our
contention.
we
say
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
treaty
and
the
statute
rules
in
our
favor,
counts
us
to
be
entitled
to
this
injunction.
now,
the
court
has
turned
us
down
for
reasons
i
do
not
know
because
there
was
no
opinion
rendered
by
the
district
court
judge.
all
that
he
admitted
at
one
point
during
the
argument
that
the
question
of
the
treaty
and
the
statute
that
is
the
matter
of
law
so
i
have
a
right
to
--
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
if
i
only
may
disagree
with
the
statement
that
the
district
court
did
not
say
--
mr.
david
toren
yes.
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
well,
your
honor,
the
defendant
has
completely
ignored
the
legal
issue
in
the
proceedings
below
and
has
said
this
is
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
david
toren
suppose
the
judge
wouldn't
do
that.
suppose
the
judge
would
have
said
well
i
think
that
case
should
be
tried
because
my
learned
friend
here
said
there
are
some
people
who
--
mr.
david
toren
it's
only
speculative.
i
don't
know
how
this
--
mr.
david
toren
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
i
don't
know.
mr.
justice
fortas
started
it.
mr.
david
toren
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever.
mr.
david
toren
right.
the
statute
says
--
mr.
david
toren
yes.
appeals
from
refusals
of
injunctions
are
allowed.
well,
an
injunction
has
been
refused
so
i
can
appeal,
it's
that
simple.
mr.
david
toren
if
i
may
develop
my
argument
on
that
point,
we
concede
that
interlocutory
appeals
are
not
looked
upon
this
favor.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
but
we
feel
that
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
is
fallacious
and
unsound
for
three
reasons.
one,
it
ignores
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
two,
it
ignores
the
plain
wording
and
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
three
it
is
against
the
very
purpose
of
summary
judgment.
now,
in
respect
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
purpose
of
section
1292
is
to
create
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
finality
that
has
been
previously
recognized
by
this
court,
mr.
justice
fortas
and
i
refer
you
to
baltimore
contractors
versus
bodinger
which
was
decided
in
1954
and
the
court
expressly
stated
that
this
section,
section
1292
is
an
expressed
exception
to
the
rule
of
finality.
now,
the
legislative
history
does
not
shed
any
light
on
the
reasons
why
congress
modified
the
rules
of
finality
in
respect
to
interlocutory
appeal.
but
this
court
in
devoting
our
case
which
i
referred
state
it
and
i
quote,
“the
changes
seem
plainly
to
spring
from
a
developing
need
to
permit
litigants
to
effectually
challenge
interlocutory
orders
of
serious,
perhaps
irreparable
consequence.”
mr.
david
toren
i
didn't
think
i
have
to,
your
honor.
i
have
a
statute
which
i
can
appeal
from
the
refusal
of
the
injunction.
mr.
david
toren
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
i
must
confess
your
honor
when
that
matter
came
up,
there
was
not
a
slightest
doubt
in
our
mind
that
that
this
is
an
appealable
order.
the
plain
clear
meaning
of
the
statute
says
that
i
can
appeal
from
the
refusal
of
an
injunction.
what
else
do
i
need?
why
should
i
go
through
additional
procedural
if
the
statute
tells
me
i
can
appeal?
mr.
david
toren
i
have
the
circuit
against
us
but
i
have
an
overwhelming
--
mr.
david
toren
well,
i
have
the
fifth
circuit
on
my
side
that
the
international
forwarding
case
and
i
have
the
statute.
what
else
do
i
need?
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
if
i
may
disagree
in
respect
i
think
the
points
raised
by
your
honor
completely
ignore
the
statute.
mr.
david
toren
pardon,
i
didn't
--
mr.
david
toren
the
issue
for
the
court
of
appeals
is
whether
or
not
the
motion
was
denied
correctly
or
incorrectly.
mr.
david
toren
on
the
merits
sure.
it
never
reached
the
merits
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
toren
but
that's
not
what
the
court
said.
mr.
david
toren
the
chief
justice
went
up
and
said
dismissed.
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
toren
your
honor.
your
honor
will
agree
with
me
that
if
the
district
court
would
have
granted
a
motion,
he
would
have
had
a
final
judgment,
a
final
order
appealable
under
section
1291.
mr.
david
toren
but
then
now
--
suppose
now
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
held
that
motion
should
not
have
been
granted
because
there
were
issues
of
facts,
now
the
respondent
to
it
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
appeal.
now,
why
should
we
be
in
the
worst
position?
in
fact,
--
mr.
david
toren
there
was
the
statute
that
say
i
can
appeal.
mr.
david
toren
but,
i
disagree
with
that
your
honor
because
the
district
court
judge
said
this
is
a
matter
of
law
and
this
is
a
forum.
mr.
david
toren
okay,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
--
mr.
david
toren
perfect.
mr.
david
toren
correct.
mr.
david
toren
no,
your
honor.
what
happened
was
one
of
our
counselor
sitting
in
the
chamber
as
the
case
was
called
and
it's
supposed
to
tell
the
time
of
argument
so
our
men
went
up
and
said
one
hour
argument
so
the
chief
judge
says,
case
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
that's
it
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
and
then
came
an
opinion.
mr.
david
toren
without
any
argument.
now
we
feel
that
that
this
was
correct.
mr.
david
toren
oh
yes.
mr.
david
toren
pardon?
mr.
david
toren
on
the
merits.
mr.
david
toren
that's
correct.
now
in
our
brief,
we
argued
the
appealability
of
the
order
but
not
only
as
an
auxiliary
matter
because
we
sought
that
was
more
or
less
clear
cut.
mr.
david
toren
no.
mr.
david
toren
that's
correct.
mr.
david
toren
if
i
may
refer
your
honor
to
our
brief.
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
i
quote
from
the
record
pages
47
and
48
and
i
read
from
the
brief.
mr.
toren,
that's
me,
“now
the
second
point
was
the
international
conventional
of
the
lanham
act.
it
hasn't
even
been
mentioned
in
mr.
cole's
brief.”
mr.
cole,
for
the
respondent,
now,
that
means
he
has
not
attacked
it.
the
court,
“apparently,
he
takes
the
position
that
it
is
not
conclusive.”
that
is
the
position
he
takes
from
what
he
said
mr.
toren
but
that
is
not
a
matter
of
genuine
issue
of
fact
if
he
simply
says
with
the
court
that
is
the
matter
of
law.
mr.
david
toren
yes.
mr.
toren,
this
is
a
matter
of
law,
the
court,
if
you
what
you
claim
is
so.
mr.
david
toren
now
from
this
i
can
--
i
can
infer
--
mr.
david
toren
oh!
yes,
i
know
that.
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
that
motion
was
denied
because
of
an
outstanding
matter
of
fact
or
an
outstanding
matter
of
law.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
we
have
a
statute
which
permit
appeals
some
refusals
of
injunction
whatever
the
reason.
mr.
chief
justice
my
time
is
up
but
--
mr.
david
toren
thank
you.
i
haven't
been
able
to
present
my
argument
if
i
may
so.
so
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law.
the
statute
is
abundantly
clear,
its
plain
meaning,
its
plain
language
is
the
court
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
from
appeal
from
interlocutory
orders
refusing
injunction.
here
we
have
an
order
which
refused
an
injunction
well
then
therefore
within
the
statute.
now,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
court
below
admitted
that
we
are
within
the
exact
letter
of
the
statute
but
the
court
says
that
the
spirit
of
the
statute
is
against
us.
now,
what
does
it
mean?
that
means,
if
you
read
the
statute
literally,
our
appeal
has
to
be
allowed.
but
literal
reading
is
taboo
because
of
the
general
policy
against
interlocutory
appeals.
that
means
the
fifth
circuit
spurns
the
meaning
of
the
language,
the
plain
meaning
in
favor
of
a
doctrine
for
which
this
statute
is
the
exception.
i
submit
that
this
is
the
most
unpersuasive
reason
to
ignore
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
toren
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
request
some
additional
time?
mr.
david
toren
thank
you.
