well,
actually
you
would
be
really
(inaudible)
the
state
of
the
court
of
appeals
you
hear
this
appeal
on
the
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
obviously
you
couldn't
advise
that,

you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
what
you're
really
saying
is
you
don't
agree
with
the
district
court
in
saying
that
there's
an
issue
of
fact
but
if
you're
stuck
with
it
and
you
have
to
go
back
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
you
proceed
on
the
ground
that
there
was
an
issue
of
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
--
if
it
did
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
district
court
said
there
was
an
issue
of
fact,
even
though
you
disagree
with
that.
nevertheless,
if
you're
stuck
with
it,
you
have
to
go
back
and
try
the
case
on
the
premise
that
there
is
an
issue
of
fact.
