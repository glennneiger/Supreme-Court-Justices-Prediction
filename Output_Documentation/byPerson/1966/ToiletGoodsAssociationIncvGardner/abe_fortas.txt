justice
abe
fortas
diluent,
diluent,
how
do
you
pronounce
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon
not
that
they
were
contending
that
the
commissioner
says
i
am
going
to
list
and
certify
the
video
inseparably.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lewin
if
an
individual
manufacturer
for
appropriate
procedure
challenged
this
in
a
particular
case
as
you
argue
is
contemplated
by
statute,
would
it
be
possible
for
him
to
argue
that
the
regulation
is
confiscatory.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
now
in
this
case,
(inaudible)
in
paragraph
47
on
their
complaint
as
i
see
it,
they're
arguing
they
are
making
a
kind
of
a
substantive
due
process
argument
that
this
regulation
is
confiscatory
from
an
industry
wide
basis,
which
does
sound
to
me
like
some
of
the
substantive
due
process,
but
on
the
industry
wide
basis,
in
other
words,
the
industry
as
a
whole
says
we're
entitled
to
be
considered
as
a
whole
and
considering
us
as
a
whole
this
regulation
is
confiscatory.
justice
abe
fortas
for
the
fee
requirement?
justice
abe
fortas
well
it
goes
back
to
the
separate
listing
for
it.
and
i
was
just
wondering
what
comment
you
have
to
make
as
to
what
seems
to
me
to
perhaps
erroneous,
whether
it
be
the
basic
theory
underlying
this
case
and
perhaps
remotely
and
indirectly
in
the
preceding
case
and
that
is
that
an
industry
as
a
whole
has
a
standing
to
challenge
a
government
regulation
and
that
the
industry
as
a
whole
in
this
particular
paragraph
has
standing
to
have
the
economic
impact
of
the
regulation
considered
on
the
industry
as
a
whole
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
it's
confiscatory.
justice
abe
fortas
well
did
they
support
this
lawsuit.
justice
abe
fortas
assuming
that
what
you're
saying
were
true,
would
that
have
a
right
to
an
injunction?
justice
abe
fortas
could
this,
would
they
have
standing
to
maintain
this
--
would
this
be
an
appropriate
suit.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
can't
then
that
be
litigated
at
a
later
time,
if
this
can't
be,
why
couldn't
they
refuse
to
list
and
go
ahead
and
market
the
product
and
have
action
brought
against
them
at
one
sort
or
another
and
then
contend
in
defense
of
their
listing
that
the
payment
of
the
fee
is
confiscatory?
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
are
willing
to
concede
that
i
have
difficulty
with
the
rest
of
your
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ross
suppose
if
food
and
drug
administration
discovered,
found
and
discovered
that
a
particular
and
common
ingredient
used
in
cosmetics
cause
cancer
or
induced
cancer
giving
a
wild
example
and
let's
suppose
then
under
361(a)
after
appropriate
proceedings,
and
adopted
a
regulation
saying
that
cosmetic
shall
be
deemed
to
be
adulterated
if
they
include
such
and
such
an
ingredient
it
or
if
the
label
doesn't
say
so
and
so.
now
under
your
theory
of
the
case
where
an
injunction
applies,
could
a
drug
cosmetic
company
or
the
industry
or
group
cosmetic
companies
maintain
an
injunction
proceeding
to
prevent
food
and
drug
from
administering
that
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
key
question--
justice
abe
fortas
no
i'm
not,
i'm
not
dealing
with
that.
i'm
dealing
with
question
of
court
jurisdiction.
now
in
that
--
i
am
talking
about
section
361.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
jurisdiction
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
not
color
ingredient,
just
an
ingredient.
justice
abe
fortas
any
ingredient.
justice
abe
fortas
3621(a).
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
suppose
the
secretary
adopted,
promulgated
a
regulation
and
they
said
that
these
cosmetics
shall
not
contain
this
ingredient
or
shall
not
contain
this
ingredient
unless
there
is
a
warning
on
the
label
that's
under
361,
and
i
just,
i
want
to
know
whether
industry
or
company,
if
it
thought
that
that
was
confiscatory,
might
very
well
be
in
practical
effect,
could
bring
an
injunction
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
then
district
court
here
say
that
expert
testimony
would
be
helpful?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that,
was
that
the
trust
of
pre-trial
to
find
out
purpose
of
regulations.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
you
put
food
and
drug
people
on
the
stand
and
examine
them
as
to
what
they
intended
by
these
regulations.
justice
abe
fortas
now
can
you
do
that
when
you
go
to
a
court
of
appeals
to
review
an
administrative
regulation?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
this
is
something
new
that's
been
added
in
administrative
law?
justice
abe
fortas
why
was
that
--
the
court
felt
that
it
needed
some
light,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
it
may
be--
justice
abe
fortas
it
suggested
in
my
mind,
i
may
be
wrong
mr.
ross
that
judge
felt
the
absence
of
what
you
get
when
you
have
a
specific
case
before
you,
after
there
has
been
an
attempt
to
enforce
a
regulation
and
in
that
way
you
get
an
idea
of
the
meaning
attached
to
it
by
the
administrative
agency
and
absence
of
that,
the
court
said
that
you
probably
just
go
around
and
poke
in
to
the
administrative
mind
whatever
that
would
be.
justice
abe
fortas
the
congress
provided
for
the
fee
or
is
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
authorized
by
the
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
cost
to
companies,
that
much
money
it
must
cost
the
government
a
lot
of
money
to
make
it
test
too
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
possible
that
there
are
some
products
in
which
you
can
test
the
color
additives
standing
by
itself,
another
products
or
species
or
varieties
or
how
do
you
i
don't
know
what
the
proper
word
is,
in
which
you'll
have
to
test
the
whole
product
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
effect
of
the
color
additive
is.
i
remember
mr.
ross,
maybe
i
am
wrong
but
i
remember
the
hearing,
it's
all
started
because
of
a
lot
of
publicity
with
respect
to
deleterious
effects
of
some
cosmetics,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
the
whole
background
of
this
is
belief
in
some
quarters
or
the
publicity
or
propaganda
whatever
you
wanted
to
say,
to
the
effect
that
some
cosmetics
have
been
harmful.
justice
abe
fortas
there
have
been
any
such--
justice
abe
fortas
have
been
any
such
belief?
justice
abe
fortas
then
you
are
saying
to
me
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
not
in
any
time
contented
that
cosmetics
might
be
--
certain
cosmetics
might
be
harmful.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
get
to
my
precise
question,
is
it
possible
and
perhaps
you've
already
answered
it,
that
there
in,
that
in
some
instances
you
can
test
the
color
additives
standing
alone.
in
other
instances,
you
have
to
look
at
the
total
product
in
order
to
find
out
whether
the
color
additive
is
or
is
not
harmful?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
so
that
you
might
have
a
very
different
situation
depending
upon
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
and
the
characteristics
of
the
particular
product.
justice
abe
fortas
right
now
what
you
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
get
a
procedure,
device
a
procedure
by
which
an
injunction
being
--
ask
court
for
an
injunction
on
the
basis
of
a
generalization?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
other
possibility
is
that
you
might
guess
â€“
you
have
to
wait
until
a
particular
situation
is
presented
to
the
courts
in
the
context
of
a
particular
administrative
action.
justice
abe
fortas
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
cosmetics
and
not
bicycles.
justice
abe
fortas
diluent,
diluent,
how
do
you
pronounce
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon
not
that
they
were
