mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
cross-writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
demonstrate
even
more
clearly
than
does
the
abbott
laboratories
case
the
harms
which
flow
from
premature
judicial
intervention
and
of
the
administration
of
the
food
and
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
under
the
terms
of
that
statutes
enacted
in
1938,
the
food
and
drug
administrations
was
to
protect
the
nations’
consumers
against
certain
harmful
coloring
ingredients
in
foods,
drugs
and
cosmetics
by
a
premarketing
clearance
procedure
under
which
it
was
to
require
manufacturers
to
test
coal-tar
colors
for
safety.
after
the
food
and
drug
administration
had
reviewed
the
results
of
these
tests,
it
was
authorized
to
list
such
colors
as
it
found
harmless
or
suitable
for
use.
late
in
1958,
this
court
sustained
the
food
and
drug
administrations’
position
that
the
statutory
scheme
under
that
1938
act
contemplated
that
only
totally
harmless
coal-tar
colors
could
be
listed.
in
other
words,
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
not
required
to
concern
itself
with
the
precise
concentration
or
the
mixtures
in
which
such
colors
would
have
been
used
in
foods,
drugs
or
cosmetics
or
with
any
of
the
products
with
which
they
were
combined.
only
if
the
coloring
ingredient
was
absolutely
and
totally
harmless
could
it
be
listed
under
the
existing
standard
that
was
flemming
versus
florida
citrus
exchange
in
358
u.s.
recognizing
the
merit
of
an
industry
complaint
that
such
an
absolute
standard
prohibited
the
use
of
coloring
ingredients
which
might
be
totally
innocuous
in
small
quantities
that
actually
used,
the
food
and
drug
administration
supported
the
mandatory
legislation
which
was
enacted
to
the
color
additive
amendments
in
1960.
that
statute
which
is
reprinted
in
relevant
portions
of
pages
24
and
29,
and
37
of
our
brief
in
this
case
extended
the
premarketing
clearance
procedure
to
all
color
items
both
natural
and
synthetic
coal-tar
and
any
other
coloring
ingredients
which
were
derived
from
any
other
source.
it
empowered
the
food
and
drug
administration,
which
had
been
delegated
the
powers
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
under
the
act
to
list
color
additives
after
review
of
testing
information
submitted
by
the
manufacturer
with
“conditions
under
which
the
additives
might
be
safely
used.”
section
706(a)(2)(b),
and
(a)(3)
which
appear
at
page
30
of
our
brief
are
quite
clear
on
that
subject.
they
authorized
the
secretary
to
list
a
color
additive
for
a
“more
limited
use
or
uses
than
have
been
applied
for”
and
“prescribed
the
conditions
under
which
such
additive
maybe
safely
employed
for
such
use
or
uses.”
the
act
was
passed
in
july
of
1960
with
appropriate
provisions,
for
provisional
listings
of
color
additives
which
had
been
used
until
the
administrative
machinery
had
gone
through
the
process
and
completed
verifying
the
information
on
the
color
additive
applications,
which
would
be
submitted.
in
june
1963,
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drugs
after
reporting
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
submit
return
comments
in
the
section
4
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
issued
substantially
the
regulations
which
appear
22
cfr
8.1
to
8.52,
it
covers
about
20
pages
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
among
those
regulations
were
four
clauses
which
are
specifically
the
challenge
in
this
case.
section
8.1,
all
those
four
all
appear
at
pages
37
and
38
of
our
brief.
section
8.1f
defined
color
additives
as
used
in
the
statute
and
have
been
subjected
to
these
procedures
by
the
congress
to
include
“a
substance
that
when
applied
to
the
human
body
results
in
coloring,”
and
it
specifically
enumerated
lipstick,
rouge,
eye
makeup
colors
and
related
cosmetics
intended
for
coloring
the
human
body.
in
other
words,
the
food
and
drug
administration
construed
the
act
as
subjecting
to
this
premarketing
clearance
procedure,
finished
cosmetic
products
used
for
coloring
the
human
body.
the
very
same
section
of
the
code
of
federal
regulation
also
defined
color
additive
to
include
old
diluents
and
diluents
were
defined
in
the
definitionary
provisions
of
that
regulation
as
any
component
of
a
color
additive
mixture
that
is
not
of
itself
a
color
additive
and
has
been
intentionally
mixed
there
in
to
facilitate
the
use
of
the
mixture
in
color.
in
other
words,
anything
added
for
purposes
of
--
essentially
anything
added
to
a
product
which
contains
coloring
ingredient.
in
addition
section
8.01(u)
defines
the
hair
dye
exemption
statute,
the
statute
specifically
congress
exempted
from
its
provisions,
hair
dyes
provisions
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
in
the
preclearance
procedures,
hair
dyes
which
contain
color
ingredients
whose
harmful
nature
could
be
determined
by
what’s
commonly
known
as
a
patch
test.
a
test,
which
the
consumer
could
apply
to
his
own
skin
and
determine
whether
there
was
anything
in
that
hair
dye
which
would,
which
would
harm
him
or
her.
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
these
regulations
construed
the
hair
dye
exemption
of
the
statute
as
not
applying
to
any
hair
dyes
containing
products
whose
harmful
products,
whose
harmful
effects
could
not
be
testified
in
a
patch
test.
it
was
going
behind
the
words
of
the
statute
to
the
purpose
of
congress.
and
finally
the
fourth
provision
involved
in
this
suit
and
the
one
on
which
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
warned
that
if
employees
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
were
denied
access
to
manufacturing
facilities,
processes
or
formulae
of
drugs
--
of
cosmetics
which
they
were
required
to
certificate
it
in
effect
by
batch
certifications
to
check
--
though
the
very
product
itself,
then
the
commissioner
might
immediately
suspend
the
certification
service
there
by
making
those
products
nonmarket,
that
was
in
july
of
1963.
in
november
of
that
year,
before
the
regulations
were
put
in
effect,
and
for
compliance
with
any
of
these
regulations
or
before
an
effect
these
procedures
have
been
gone
through,
this
action
to
declare
clear
those
regulations
invalid
was
instituted.
the
district
judge
first
denied
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
november
1964
and
then
after
the
abbott
laboratories
case
was
decided
by
the
third
circuit
in
december
of
1965,
he
certified
interlocutory
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.
1292(b)
on
that
issues
to
whether
this
suit
was
premature
or
it
was
right
at
this
juncture
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
judge's
refusal
to
dismiss
the
first
three
counts
of
the
complaint
but
concluded
that
the
fourth
count
attacking
the
factory
inspection
provision
was
premature
and
should
be
dismissed.
so
the
only
issue
before
this
court,
the
only
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
interlocutory
appeal
was
the
question
of
rightness
and
prematurity.
in
this
case,
unlike
abbott
laboratories,
we
do
not
alternatively
urge
for
that
reason
that
the
court
consider
the
merits
if
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
do
not
go
on
to
discuss
or
urge
the
merits
beyond
the
jurisdictional
point
because
we
think
the
only
issue
that
was
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
interlocutory
appeal
was
the
question
of
pre-maturity
of
rights.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
i
know
but
the
district
judge
i
think
was
concerned
over
with
the
intent
of
the
people
who
are
behind
the
legislation.
i
am
really
not
sure
as
to
what
the
pretrial
was
concerned.
about
the
--
apparently
the
intent,
the
motives,
the
legislative
intent
behind
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
district
judge,
yes
the
district
judge
thought
that
was
a
relevant
way
of
determining
what
the
statute
meant.
i
don't
know
whether
all,
i
suppose,
i'm
told
that
all
the
pretrial
discovery
concern
that
issue
what
was
the
legislative
intent
when
they
passed
the
color
additive
amendment.
we
don't
necessarily
agree
that
that's
a
proper
way
of
determining
legislative
intent,
i
must
say
that,
that
was
the
district
judge's
view.
now,
we
have
attempted
in
the
introduction
to
our
main
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
to
explain
why
we
think
that
this
case
in
it's
present
posture
at
least
insofar
as
it
affects
those
first
two
counts,
the
finished
cosmetic
product
and
the
diluents
is
particularly
premature
and
entirely
hypothetical.
now
i'll
try
to
summarize
that
position
as
briefly
as
i
can.
it
appears
to
be
agreed
and
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
whatsoever
that
under
the
1960
amendment
the
color
additive
amendment
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
congress
intended
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
apply
a
safety
in
use
standard
under
which
it
was,
the
administration
was
to
determine
before
listing
a
color
additive
not
whether
that
color
additive
in
the
abstract
and
just
taken
purely
by
itself
was
safe,
but
whether
as
used
in
a
finished
cosmetic
or
in
any
finished
product
whether
that
color
ingredient
was
safe.
consequently,
the
practical
result
of
that,
the
administration
of
that
kind
of
a
test
is
that
an
applicant
for
listing
doesn't
satisfy
his
burden
under
the
statute
by
merely
testing
the
coloring
if
the
color
ingredient
as
such,
just
that
pigment.
he
has
to
submit
to
the
commissioner
information
on
how
he
will
use
the
coloring
ingredient
and
sufficient
scientific
data,
pre-testing
if
you
will
as
to
the
other
ingredients
that
will
be
included
with
the
pigment
or
the
dye
and
the
finished
product.
in
other
words
the
food
and
drug
administration
cannot
be
expected
in
administering
a
safety
in
use
standard
to
list
color
x
as
safe
for
use
in
a
finished
product
unless
it
has
adequate
information
that
the
finished
product
and
the
ingredients
that
are
added
to
the
color,
the
color
pigment
or
dye
are
safe
for
use,
but
was
that
true
that
an
entirely,
a
pigment
or
dye
that
may
appear
to
safe
in
the
abstract
when
combined
with
other
products
or
when
put
in
a
finished
product
may
not
be
safe,
be
safe
for
listing,
then
obviously
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drug,
the
food
and
drug
administration,
when
it
finally
lists
color
x
for
safe
in
use
in
a
certain
finished
product
is
in
effect
listing
the
finished
product
as
well
as
the
coloring
ingredient
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing
which
becomes
obvious
we
submit
once
the
total
system
as
administrated
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
goes
into
effect.
if
the
company
in
this
case
were
to
submit
adequate
information
under
a
safety
in
use
standard
even
under
their
own
construction
of
what
color
additive
meant
and
if
the
food
and
drug
administration
would
then
define
that
those
pigments,
those
coloring
ingredients
as
used
in
a
finished
product
are
safe
and
are
listable
in
effect
and
will
be
listed
then
the
controversy
is
over,
they
haven't
been
hurt
at
all.
their
finished
product
will
be
listed,
their
coloring
ingredient
will
be
listed,
and
their
diluents
will
be
listed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think,
we
submit
that
and
i
don't
think
they
really
disputed
is
that
we
have
jurisdiction
or
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
jurisdiction
to
control
a
finished
product
although
not
as
such
if
it
had
no
color
ingredients,
but
does
have
jurisdiction
to
control
it
as
a
terminal
use
of
a
coloring
ingredient.
well,
that
make
that
is
precisely
what
makes
the
suit,
that's
in
first
account
disappear
everything
because
if
we
do
have
jurisdiction
to
make
that
determination
then
they
are
not
they
are
very
likely
not
to
be
hurt
at
all
once
the
whole
machinery
has
been
carried
through
and
that,
it
seem
to
me
indicates
to
us
what
the
harms
are
or
it's
illustrative
of
the
harms
of
premature
judicial
intervention.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
diluents,
we
think
that's
true
with
the
diluents
too.
assuming
you
take
a
color
ingredient
that
is
totally
harmless
in
and
of
itself.
if
it's
combined
with
any
other
product
in
which
it
appears
in
a
finished
cosmetic
product
produces
a
poisonous
result
because
the
diluent
is
poisonous,
obviously
the
commissioner
can't
be
expected
to
list
the
coloring
ingredient
as
permissible
for
use
with
that
diluent
and
the
statute
itself
makes
entirely
clear
that
the
listings
are
supposed
to,
are
supposed
to
list
the
color
ingredients
for
use
with
or
without
certain
diluents.
now
if
that's
true
and
the
commissioner
is
supposed
to
specify
the
diluents
with
which
pigment
x
can
be
mixed,
well
then
he
is
got
to
pay
us
on
whether
these
diluents
are
safe.
and
if
he's
got,
the
way
he
passes
on
that
is
he
asks
the
requires
of
this
company
to
make
tests
on
the
diluents
to
submit
the
results
of
those
tests
and
to
have
the
food
and
drug
administration
pass
upon.
so
that
although
this
astute
at
the
present
they
look
like
a
challenge
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
regulation.
if
in
fact
we
waited
until
the
companies
actually
felt
any
kind
of
pinch
at
all,
i
think
it
will
be
discovered
that
they
feel
none.
now
they
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
commissioner
mr.
justice
fortas
i
don't
has
ever
said
that
and
from
what
i
am
understand
the
need
food
and
drug
administration
takes
no
such
position.
it's
position
is
that
you
can
list
product
either
let's
say
lipstick,
ether
under
a
common
base,
under
a
common
color
ingredient,
you
can
list
it
together
with
certain
diluents,
list
the
diluents
separately,
but
they
had
nothing,
they
had
nothing
in
the
statute
and
had
nothing
in
the
food
and
drug
administration
of
these
provisions
which
would
require
them
to
list
these
separately
and
that
we
think
also
explores
the
exaggerated
costs
claim,
their
(inaudible)
estimates
because
one
affidavit
in
the
record
and
that
also
appear
in
the
brief
of
the
companies
in
this
case,
adds
to
the
costs
of
complying
with
this
because
of
the
listing
and
testing
provisions.
well,
the
listing
there
is
a
listing
deposit
under
the
regulations
issued
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
of
$2600
per
petition
for
listing,
but
that's
a
deposit
only,
that's
to
deprive
the
processing
cost
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
passing
on
the
petition.
now
not
with
--
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
not
going
to
be
listing
or
incurring
this
$2600
cost
with
each
one
of
a
lipsticks
of
any
particular
plaintiff's
obviously
they
can
list
them
all
together
under
one
paragraph
of
the
code
of
federal
regulation
and
the
total
cost
will
not
even
remotely
approach
what
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
contend.
and
say
things
true
with
the
pre-testing,
sure
they
would
have
to
be
testing
of
the
finished
product
and
of
the
diluents,
but
there
are
so
many
common
ingredients
among
all
these,
i
mean
the
plaintiffs
referred
to
one
company's
2700
cosmetic
formulae,
but
there
are
so
many
common
ingredients
let's
say
among
all
of
these
lipsticks
that
it
fallacious
to
just
simply
multiply
them
all
and
say
that
gives
you
the
total
cost
of
the
complying
with
the
food
and
drug
administration
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it's
more
premature,
you
can
put
that
way.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
well,
i
think
maybe
the
way
they
distinguished
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
well
the
way
they
distinguish--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
way
to
distinguish
the
two
is
that
in
abbott
labs
you
know
exactly
what
the
plaintiffs
will
have
to
do
to
comply
with
the
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
this
case
we
submit
it's
very
likely,
they
will
have
to
do
nothing
more
than
they
would
have
to
do
anyway
to
comply
with.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
whether
you
could
put
that
it
to
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
i
think
it's
more
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
impact
of
the
regulation.
yeah
i
think
there
is
that
difference.
now,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
plaintiffs
in
abbott
lab
talk
about
their
harms
in
terms
of
publicity
as
a
result
of
seizure
or
injunctions
or
criminal
prosecution.
well,
again
that's
precisely
the
harm
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
mytinger
&
casselberry
case,
in
an
opinion
by
justice
douglas
said
that
in
the
context
of
the
food
and
drug
act
that
the
fact
that
a
seizure
might
cause
irreparable
harm
to
a
business
didn't
mean
“the
hands
of
government
must
be
stayed
until
the
courts
have
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
the
government
is
justified
in
instituting
suit”
that
was
a
preliminary
step
to
a
seizure
and
this
is
--
and
even
more
preliminary
step
in
effect
to
a
seizure
because
this
is
an
effect
the
commission
saying,
the
food
and
drug
administration
saying
that
these
are
the
procedural
steps
we
will
go
through,
and
i
think
these
are
requirements
we
will
impose
on
the
industry
before
we
ultimately
pay
us
on
all
these
color
additives,
the
safety
of
the
color
additives
the
color--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
he
could,
i
don't
at
present
concede
in
what
way
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
paragraph
47
goes
to
the
fee
requirement
again.
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
to
the
fee
requirement.
in
other
words
what
they're
saying
in
effect
is
that
the
total
fee
which
result
from
requiring
separate
listing
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
there
are
really
two
answers
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
first
did
nothing
in
what,
the
claimant
here
on
abbott
labs
urge
which
would
limit
their
suit
to
an
industry
wide
suit
as
a
whole
that
if
in
some
way
there
were
some
means
of
ensuring
that
entire
industry
would
bring
a
suit
which
would
protect
that
industry's
interest,
i
think
it
would
take
a
statute
for,
but
if
there
was
some
way
of
limiting
the
doctrine
of
that,
then
i
think
the
questions
would
be
substantially
different.
and
one
of
our
problems
with
the
rightness
claim
in
this
case
and
in
abbott
labs
is
that
opens
the
door
to
individuals.
i
think
a
second
answer
is
really
that
neither
in
abbott
lab
certainly
where
whatever
claim
the
whole
industry
has,
the
individual
drug
manufacturer
has
as
well.
nor
in
this
case,
where
there's
really
no
basis
for
the
claim,
can
it
be
any
industry
wide
claim.
let
me
make
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
make
that
last
point
a
little
bit
clearer
really.
if
it
were
true
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
regulations
prescribed
an
absolute
$2600
fee
for
each
listing
and
the
food
and
drug
administrator,
commissioner
said
i
will
have
to
list
every
finished
cosmetic
product
separately,
that's
the
way
i
construe
it
and
i
won't
allow
you
to
do
anything
other
than
that,
i
think
there
might
be
room
to
argue
that
the
harm
that
would
be
done
by
waiting
until
the
actual
pinch
is
felt
would
be
irreparable,
because
the
industry
would
be
expected
to
forth
over
$2600
for
each
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon
me?
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh
i
think
there
would
be
much
more
basis
for
permitting
that
kind
of
a
suit.
we
think,
and
i
think
we
try
to
make
clear
in
our
brief
that
rightness
is
not
something
that
you
can
determine
simply
by
any
actual
rule.
we
think
that
when
really
a
whole
industry
maybe
hurt
or
will
be
hurt
by
being
forced
to
pay
confiscatory
costs
which
they
will
no
opportunity
to
litigate
at
any
later
time,
in
other
words,
the
regulation
either
has
to
be
challenged
now
or
never,
we
think
that
would
be
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
that
would
be
true
with
that
individual
fee
be
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
if
their
allegations
are
true,
i
suppose
they
say
we've
already
paid
--
forced
to
pay
$7
million
with
all
our
2700
petitions
and
to
force
us
to
pay
700
--
$7
million.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
it,
but
i'm
saying
that's
a
different,
it
seems
that's
that
a
difference
case.
if
that
were
true
i
think
this
case
might
be
closer
to
abbott
laboratories.
that
fact
that
that
isn't
true
i
think
is
what
makes
this
case
disappear,
makes
it
much
clearer
than
abbot
laboratories,
because
in
this
case
there
is
no
such
requirement.
the
industry
is
not
being
asked
today
to
pay
$42
million
in
listing
fees
or
forego
using
it's
cosmetics
for
the
next
few
years.
if
that
were
true,
we
think
there
might
be
some
room
for
arguing
that
--
maybe
they
ought
to
be
permitted
to
litigate
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'd
just
take
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
clarify
possibly
this
question
of
course
which
has
come
up
again.
we
submit
that
the
figures
given
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
suit,
is
completely
inflated
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
that
requires
separate
listing
for
each
finished
cosmetic
product.
they
have
the
particular
cosmetic
company
that
produces
2700
cosmetic
products
could,
for
all
we
know,
submit
ten
petitions
to
cover
all
those
2700
products
and
they
would
not
be
required
to
pay
more
than
ten
deposits.
and
those
$2600
fees,
which
the
regulations
provide
for
are
merely
deposits,
they
are
to
cover
the
processing
cost
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
it
can
cover,
it
can
cover
a
whole
range
of
lipsticks
for
example,
the
food
and
drug
administration
will
list
--
let's
say
on
the
basis
of
a
common
base
that
the
20
or
30
lipsticks
have
a
whole
sequence
of
different
colors
that
the
company
may
provide
or
may
supply.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
found
mr.
justice
white
that
the
coloring
ingredient
in
and
of
itself
maybe
harmless,
but
when
it's
combined
with
some
of
the
diluents
that
appear
in
the
cosmetic,
the
product
is
harmful.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
it's
the
combination
of
the
two
that
may
cause
the
harm
they
interact
chemically--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
precisely
that's
exactly
--
that's
all
the
power
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
don't
it
doesn't
have
to
be
separately
listed
that's
exactly
our
point,
they
can
all
be
--
they
will
all
appear
in
the
one
paragraph--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
well,
because
presumably
the
other
products
in
the
world
that
are
being
combined
with
that
are
being
combined--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
no
realistically
that
they
are
different
from
this
product
because
there
is
a
third
diluent
that's
in,
there
is
another
--
that's
what
distinguishes
them
from
this
and
that
we
don't
know
what
the
coloring
ingredient—
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
then
it
will
not
have
to
separately
listed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
being
statute
specifically
provides
mr.
justice
white
that
the
secretary
or
the
commissioner
has
authorized
to
list
color
ingredients
generally
if
he
feels
that
really
if
it
combined
with
any
other
product
they
will
cause
no
harm.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
there
is
a
possibility
that
it
will
cause
harm
yes,
and
i
think
the
commissioner
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
the
listing
will
say
color
ingredient
a
when
added
to
diluent
a
is
safe
and
no
matter
who
produces
it,
we
don't
care
who
the
manufacturer
is
no
matter
who
produces
he
will
be
permitted
under
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
they
are
all
identical
definitely,
but
all
that
we
are
saying
if
they
if
one
had
one
diluent
and
the
other
one
has
two
and
the
third
one
has
three,
they
do
have
to
list
those
which
differ
to
the
extent
they
differ
and
even
the
$2600
cost
if
there
is
nothing,
if
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
would
say
that
the
combination
of
base,
a
base
made
up
of
certain
chemicals
with
a
certain
ingredients
is
permissible,
he
wouldn't,
he
would
list
it
that
way,
he
does
it
with
his
brand
name.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yeah.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
is
listed
in
a
federal
register,
in
the
federal
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
it's
chemically
identical
it's
listed,
you
can
sell
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
every
finished
product
to
the
extent
that
it
differs
not
to
the
extent
that
it's
label
is
different,
not
to
the
extent
that
its
put
up
on
a
different
brand.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
well
i
think
the
regulations
just
speaks
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
not
every
brand,
no
i
don't
think
anybody
has
ever
suggested
that
you
have
got
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
it's
chemically
identical
you
don't
have
to
list
it
again,
the
perfect
illustration
is
cellophane
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
regulation
which
covers
a
variety
of
cellophane
product,
it
never
mentions
certainly
particular
brand,
it
just
covers
them
in
one
paragraph
with
a
wide
variety
of
chemical,
different
chemical
products.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
and
we
think
the
same
thing
could
apply
to
a
cosmetic
additive.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
no,
no,
but
it's
just
that
the
very
same
technique
could
be
used
by
the
commissioner
or
will
be
used
by
the
commissioner
in
the
food
field
and
that
the
food
additive
problem
of
course
is
quite
different.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
because
but
the
usual
things
that
are
combined
with
coloring
ingredients
of
food
are
generally
totally
harmless
or
at
least
that
standard
while
obviously
in
cosmetics
there
are,
of
the
kinds
of
the
chemicals
are
being
combined
or
not
the
kind
of
things
you
can
swallow
and
you
just
don't
know,
the
commission
doesn't
know
until
it
is
testing
what,
how
they
interact
with
the
coloring
ingredients.
and
of
course,
finally
so
far
as
costs
are
concerned,
the
ultimate
answer
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
or
any
claim
where
they
objected
of
course
is
to
request
a
reduction
in
cost
if
they
think
that
the
fees
are
higher,
the
deposits
are
too
high
and
since
all
that's
involved
here
is
$2600
deposit
not
a
fee,
but
a
deposit
and
the
total,
the
total
budget
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
last
year
for
preclearance
of
food
additives
in
these
related
areas
was
$1.5
million,
it's
hardly
conceivable
that
$7
million
could
be
spent
on
the
processing
that
the
food
drug
administration
does
in
this
area.
it
doesn't
test
itself
except
to
very
limited
extent,
just
reviews
the
testing
that's
done
by
the
manufacturers.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
cross-writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
demonstrate
even
more
clearly
than
does
the
abbott
laboratories
case
the
harms
which
flow
from
premature
judicial
intervention
and
of
the
administration
of
the
food
and
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
under
the
terms
of
that
statutes
enacted
in
1938,
the
food
and
drug
administrations
was
to
protect
the
nations’
consumers
against
certain
harmful
coloring
ingredients
in
foods,
drugs
and
cosmetics
by
a
premarketing
clearance
procedure
under
which
it
was
to
require
manufacturers
to
test
coal-tar
colors
for
safety.
after
the
food
and
drug
administration
had
reviewed
the
results
of
these
tests,
it
was
authorized
to
list
such
colors
as
it
found
harmless
or
suitable
for
use.
late
in
1958,
this
court
sustained
the
food
and
drug
administrations’
position
that
the
statutory
scheme
under
that
1938
act
contemplated
that
only
totally
harmless
coal-tar
colors
could
be
listed.
in
other
words,
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
not
required
to
concern
itself
with
the
precise
concentration
or
the
mixtures
in
which
such
colors
would
have
been
used
in
foods,
drugs
or
cosmetics
or
with
any
of
the
products
with
which
they
were
combined.
only
if
the
coloring
ingredient
was
absolutely
and
totally
harmless
could
it
be
listed
under
the
existing
standard
that
was
flemming
versus
florida
citrus
exchange
in
358
u.s.
recognizing
the
merit
of
an
industry
complaint
that
such
an
absolute
standard
prohibited
the
use
of
coloring
ingredients
which
might
be
totally
innocuous
in
small
quantities
that
actually
used,
the
food
and
drug
administration
supported
the
mandatory
legislation
which
was
enacted
to
the
color
additive
amendments
in
1960.
that
statute
which
is
reprinted
in
relevant
portions
of
pages
24
and
29,
and
37
of
our
brief
in
this
case
extended
the
premarketing
clearance
procedure
to
all
color
items
both
natural
and
synthetic
coal-tar
and
any
other
coloring
ingredients
which
were
derived
from
any
other
source.
it
empowered
the
food
and
drug
administration,
which
had
been
delegated
the
powers
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
under
the
act
to
list
color
additives
after
review
of
testing
information
submitted
by
the
manufacturer
with
“conditions
under
which
the
additives
might
be
safely
used.”
section
706(a)(2)(b),
and
(a)(3)
which
appear
at
page
30
of
our
brief
are
quite
clear
on
that
subject.
they
authorized
the
secretary
to
list
a
color
additive
for
a
“more
limited
use
or
uses
than
have
been
applied
for”
and
“prescribed
the
conditions
under
which
such
additive
maybe
safely
employed
for
such
use
or
uses.”
the
act
was
passed
in
july
of
1960
with
appropriate
provisions,
for
provisional
listings
of
color
additives
which
had
been
used
until
the
administrative
machinery
had
gone
through
the
process
and
completed
verifying
the
information
on
the
color
additive
applications,
which
would
be
submitted.
in
june
1963,
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drugs
after
reporting
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
submit
return
comments
in
the
section
4
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
issued
substantially
the
regulations
which
appear
22
cfr
8.1
to
8.52,
it
covers
about
20
pages
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
among
those
regulations
were
four
clauses
which
are
specifically
the
challenge
in
this
case.
section
8.1,
all
those
four
all
appear
at
pages
37
and
38
of
our
brief.
section
8.1f
defined
color
additives
as
used
in
the
statute
and
have
been
subjected
to
these
procedures
by
the
congress
to
include
“a
substance
that
when
applied
to
the
human
body
results
in
coloring,”
and
it
specifically
enumerated
lipstick,
rouge,
eye
makeup
colors
and
related
cosmetics
intended
for
coloring
the
human
body.
in
other
words,
the
food
and
drug
administration
construed
the
act
as
subjecting
to
this
premarketing
clearance
procedure,
finished
cosmetic
products
used
for
coloring
the
human
body.
the
very
same
section
of
the
code
of
federal
regulation
also
defined
color
additive
to
include
old
diluents
and
diluents
were
defined
in
the
definitionary
provisions
of
that
regulation
as
any
component
of
a
color
additive
mixture
that
is
not
of
itself
a
color
additive
and
has
been
intentionally
mixed
there
in
to
facilitate
the
use
of
the
mixture
in
color.
in
other
words,
anything
added
for
purposes
of
--
essentially
anything
added
to
a
product
which
contains
coloring
ingredient.
in
addition
section
8.01(u)
defines
the
hair
dye
exemption
statute,
the
statute
specifically
congress
exempted
from
its
provisions,
hair
dyes
provisions
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
in
the
preclearance
procedures,
hair
dyes
which
contain
color
ingredients
whose
harmful
nature
could
be
determined
by
what’s
commonly
known
as
a
patch
test.
a
test,
which
the
consumer
could
apply
to
his
own
skin
and
determine
whether
there
was
anything
in
that
hair
dye
which
would,
which
would
harm
him
or
her.
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
these
regulations
construed
the
hair
dye
exemption
of
the
statute
as
not
applying
to
any
hair
dyes
containing
products
whose
harmful
products,
whose
harmful
effects
could
not
be
testified
in
a
patch
test.
it
was
going
behind
the
words
of
the
statute
to
the
purpose
of
congress.
and
finally
the
fourth
provision
involved
in
this
suit
and
the
one
on
which
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
warned
that
if
employees
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
were
denied
access
to
manufacturing
facilities,
processes
or
formulae
of
drugs
--
of
cosmetics
which
they
were
required
to
certificate
it
in
effect
by
batch
certifications
to
check
--
though
the
very
product
itself,
then
the
commissioner
might
immediately
suspend
the
certification
service
there
by
making
those
products
nonmarket,
that
was
in
july
of
1963.
in
november
of
that
year,
before
the
regulations
were
put
in
effect,
and
for
compliance
with
any
of
these
regulations
or
before
an
effect
these
procedures
have
been
gone
through,
this
action
to
declare
clear
those
regulations
invalid
was
instituted.
the
district
judge
first
denied
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
november
1964
and
then
after
the
abbott
laboratories
case
was
decided
by
the
third
circuit
in
december
of
1965,
he
certified
interlocutory
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.
1292(b)
on
that
issues
to
whether
this
suit
was
premature
or
it
was
right
at
this
juncture
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
judge's
refusal
to
dismiss
the
first
three
counts
of
the
complaint
but
concluded
that
the
fourth
count
attacking
the
factory
inspection
provision
was
premature
and
should
be
dismissed.
so
the
only
issue
before
this
court,
the
only
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
interlocutory
appeal
was
the
question
of
rightness
and
prematurity.
in
this
case,
unlike
abbott
laboratories,
we
do
not
alternatively
urge
for
that
reason
that
the
court
consider
the
merits
if
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
do
not
go
on
to
discuss
or
urge
the
merits
beyond
the
jurisdictional
point
because
we
think
the
only
issue
that
was
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
interlocutory
appeal
was
the
question
of
pre-maturity
of
rights.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
i
know
but
the
district
judge
i
think
was
concerned
over
with
the
intent
of
the
people
who
are
behind
the
legislation.
i
am
really
not
sure
as
to
what
the
pretrial
was
concerned.
about
the
--
apparently
the
intent,
the
motives,
the
legislative
intent
behind
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
district
judge,
yes
the
district
judge
thought
that
was
a
relevant
way
of
determining
what
the
statute
meant.
i
don't
know
whether
all,
i
suppose,
i'm
told
that
all
the
pretrial
discovery
concern
that
issue
what
was
the
legislative
intent
when
they
passed
the
color
additive
amendment.
we
don't
necessarily
agree
that
that's
a
proper
way
of
determining
legislative
intent,
i
must
say
that,
that
was
the
district
judge's
view.
now,
we
have
attempted
in
the
introduction
to
our
main
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
to
explain
why
we
think
that
this
case
in
it's
present
posture
at
least
insofar
as
it
affects
those
first
two
counts,
the
finished
cosmetic
product
and
the
diluents
is
particularly
premature
and
entirely
hypothetical.
now
i'll
try
to
summarize
that
position
as
briefly
as
i
can.
it
appears
to
be
agreed
and
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
whatsoever
that
under
the
1960
amendment
the
color
additive
amendment
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
congress
intended
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
apply
a
safety
in
use
standard
under
which
it
was,
the
administration
was
to
determine
before
listing
a
color
additive
not
whether
that
color
additive
in
the
abstract
and
just
taken
purely
by
itself
was
safe,
but
whether
as
used
in
a
finished
cosmetic
or
in
any
finished
product
whether
that
color
ingredient
was
safe.
consequently,
the
practical
result
of
that,
the
administration
of
that
kind
of
a
test
is
that
an
applicant
for
listing
doesn't
satisfy
his
burden
under
the
statute
by
merely
testing
the
coloring
if
the
color
ingredient
as
such,
just
that
pigment.
he
has
to
submit
to
the
commissioner
information
on
how
he
will
use
the
coloring
ingredient
and
sufficient
scientific
data,
pre-testing
if
you
will
as
to
the
other
ingredients
that
will
be
included
with
the
pigment
or
the
dye
and
the
finished
product.
in
other
words
the
food
and
drug
administration
cannot
be
expected
in
administering
a
safety
in
use
standard
to
list
color
x
as
safe
for
use
in
a
finished
product
unless
it
has
adequate
information
that
the
finished
product
and
the
ingredients
that
are
added
to
the
color,
the
color
pigment
or
dye
are
safe
for
use,
but
was
that
true
that
an
entirely,
a
pigment
or
dye
that
may
appear
to
safe
in
the
abstract
when
combined
with
other
products
or
when
put
in
a
finished
product
may
not
be
safe,
be
safe
for
listing,
then
obviously
the
commissioner
of
food
and
drug,
the
food
and
drug
administration,
when
it
finally
lists
color
x
for
safe
in
use
in
a
certain
finished
product
is
in
effect
listing
the
finished
product
as
well
as
the
coloring
ingredient
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing
which
becomes
obvious
we
submit
once
the
total
system
as
administrated
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
goes
into
effect.
if
the
company
in
this
case
were
to
submit
adequate
information
under
a
safety
in
use
standard
even
under
their
own
construction
of
what
color
additive
meant
and
if
the
food
and
drug
administration
would
then
define
that
those
pigments,
those
coloring
ingredients
as
used
in
a
finished
product
are
safe
and
are
listable
in
effect
and
will
be
listed
then
the
controversy
is
over,
they
haven't
been
hurt
at
all.
their
finished
product
will
be
listed,
their
coloring
ingredient
will
be
listed,
and
their
diluents
will
be
listed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think,
we
submit
that
and
i
don't
think
they
really
disputed
is
that
we
have
jurisdiction
or
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
jurisdiction
to
control
a
finished
product
although
not
as
such
if
it
had
no
color
ingredients,
but
does
have
jurisdiction
to
control
it
as
a
terminal
use
of
a
coloring
ingredient.
well,
that
make
that
is
precisely
what
makes
the
suit,
that's
in
first
account
disappear
everything
because
if
we
do
have
jurisdiction
to
make
that
determination
then
they
are
not
they
are
very
likely
not
to
be
hurt
at
all
once
the
whole
machinery
has
been
carried
through
and
that,
it
seem
to
me
indicates
to
us
what
the
harms
are
or
it's
illustrative
of
the
harms
of
premature
judicial
intervention.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
diluents,
we
think
that's
true
with
the
diluents
too.
assuming
you
take
a
color
ingredient
that
is
totally
harmless
in
and
of
itself.
if
it's
combined
with
any
other
product
in
which
it
appears
in
a
finished
cosmetic
product
produces
a
poisonous
result
because
the
diluent
is
poisonous,
obviously
the
commissioner
can't
be
expected
to
list
the
coloring
ingredient
as
permissible
for
use
with
that
diluent
and
the
statute
itself
makes
entirely
clear
that
the
listings
are
supposed
to,
are
supposed
to
list
the
color
ingredients
for
use
with
or
without
certain
diluents.
now
if
that's
true
and
the
commissioner
is
supposed
to
specify
the
diluents
with
which
pigment
x
can
be
mixed,
well
then
he
is
got
to
pay
us
on
whether
these
diluents
are
safe.
and
if
he's
got,
the
way
he
passes
on
that
is
he
asks
the
requires
of
this
company
to
make
tests
on
the
diluents
to
submit
the
results
of
those
tests
and
to
have
the
food
and
drug
administration
pass
upon.
so
that
although
this
astute
at
the
present
they
look
like
a
challenge
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
regulation.
if
in
fact
we
waited
until
the
companies
actually
felt
any
kind
of
pinch
at
all,
i
think
it
will
be
discovered
that
they
feel
none.
now
they
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
commissioner
mr.
justice
fortas
i
don't
has
ever
said
that
and
from
what
i
am
understand
the
need
food
and
drug
administration
takes
no
such
position.
it's
position
is
that
you
can
list
product
either
let's
say
lipstick,
ether
under
a
common
base,
under
a
common
color
ingredient,
you
can
list
it
together
with
certain
diluents,
list
the
diluents
separately,
but
they
had
nothing,
they
had
nothing
in
the
statute
and
had
nothing
in
the
food
and
drug
administration
of
these
provisions
which
would
require
them
to
list
these
separately
and
that
we
think
also
explores
the
exaggerated
costs
claim,
their
(inaudible)
estimates
because
one
affidavit
in
the
record
and
that
also
appear
in
the
brief
of
the
companies
in
this
case,
adds
to
the
costs
of
complying
with
this
because
of
the
listing
and
testing
provisions.
well,
the
listing
there
is
a
listing
deposit
under
the
regulations
issued
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
of
$2600
per
petition
for
listing,
but
that's
a
deposit
only,
that's
to
deprive
the
processing
cost
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
passing
on
the
petition.
now
not
with
--
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
not
going
to
be
listing
or
incurring
this
$2600
cost
with
each
one
of
a
lipsticks
of
any
particular
plaintiff's
obviously
they
can
list
them
all
together
under
one
paragraph
of
the
code
of
federal
regulation
and
the
total
cost
will
not
even
remotely
approach
what
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
contend.
and
say
things
true
with
the
pre-testing,
sure
they
would
have
to
be
testing
of
the
finished
product
and
of
the
diluents,
but
there
are
so
many
common
ingredients
among
all
these,
i
mean
the
plaintiffs
referred
to
one
company's
2700
cosmetic
formulae,
but
there
are
so
many
common
ingredients
let's
say
among
all
of
these
lipsticks
that
it
fallacious
to
just
simply
multiply
them
all
and
say
that
gives
you
the
total
cost
of
the
complying
with
the
food
and
drug
administration
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it's
more
premature,
you
can
put
that
way.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
well,
i
think
maybe
the
way
they
distinguished
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
well
the
way
they
distinguish--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
way
to
distinguish
the
two
is
that
in
abbott
labs
you
know
exactly
what
the
plaintiffs
will
have
to
do
to
comply
with
the
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
this
case
we
submit
it's
very
likely,
they
will
have
to
do
nothing
more
than
they
would
have
to
do
anyway
to
comply
with.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
whether
you
could
put
that
it
to
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
i
think
it's
more
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
impact
of
the
regulation.
yeah
i
think
there
is
that
difference.
now,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
plaintiffs
in
abbott
lab
talk
about
their
harms
in
terms
of
publicity
as
a
result
of
seizure
or
injunctions
or
criminal
prosecution.
well,
again
that's
precisely
the
harm
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
mytinger
&
casselberry
case,
in
an
opinion
by
justice
douglas
said
that
in
the
context
of
the
food
and
drug
act
that
the
fact
that
a
seizure
might
cause
irreparable
harm
to
a
business
didn't
mean
“the
hands
of
government
must
be
stayed
until
the
courts
have
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
the
government
is
justified
in
instituting
suit”
that
was
a
preliminary
step
to
a
seizure
and
this
is
--
and
even
more
preliminary
step
in
effect
to
a
seizure
because
this
is
an
effect
the
commission
saying,
the
food
and
drug
administration
saying
that
these
are
the
procedural
steps
we
will
go
through,
and
i
think
these
are
requirements
we
will
impose
on
the
industry
before
we
ultimately
pay
us
on
all
these
color
additives,
the
safety
of
the
color
additives
the
color--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
he
could,
i
don't
at
present
concede
in
what
way
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
paragraph
47
goes
to
the
fee
requirement
again.
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
to
the
fee
requirement.
in
other
words
what
they're
saying
in
effect
is
that
the
total
fee
which
result
from
requiring
separate
listing
is
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
there
are
really
two
answers
to
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
first
did
nothing
in
what,
the
claimant
here
on
abbott
labs
urge
which
would
limit
their
suit
to
an
industry
wide
suit
as
a
whole
that
if
in
some
way
there
were
some
means
of
ensuring
that
entire
industry
would
bring
a
suit
which
would
protect
that
industry's
interest,
i
think
it
would
take
a
statute
for,
but
if
there
was
some
way
of
limiting
the
doctrine
of
that,
then
i
think
the
questions
would
be
substantially
different.
and
one
of
our
problems
with
the
rightness
claim
in
this
case
and
in
abbott
labs
is
that
opens
the
door
to
individuals.
i
think
a
second
answer
is
really
that
neither
in
abbott
lab
certainly
where
whatever
claim
the
whole
industry
has,
the
individual
drug
manufacturer
has
as
well.
nor
in
this
case,
where
there's
really
no
basis
for
the
claim,
can
it
be
any
industry
wide
claim.
let
me
make
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
make
that
last
point
a
little
bit
clearer
really.
if
it
were
true
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
regulations
prescribed
an
absolute
$2600
fee
for
each
listing
and
the
food
and
drug
administrator,
commissioner
said
i
will
have
to
list
every
finished
cosmetic
product
separately,
that's
the
way
i
construe
it
and
i
won't
allow
you
to
do
anything
other
than
that,
i
think
there
might
be
room
to
argue
that
the
harm
that
would
be
done
by
waiting
until
the
actual
pinch
is
felt
would
be
irreparable,
because
the
industry
would
be
expected
to
forth
over
$2600
for
each
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon
me?
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh
i
think
there
would
be
much
more
basis
for
permitting
that
kind
of
a
suit.
we
think,
and
i
think
we
try
to
make
clear
in
our
brief
that
rightness
is
not
something
that
you
can
determine
simply
by
any
actual
rule.
we
think
that
when
really
a
whole
industry
maybe
hurt
or
will
be
hurt
by
being
forced
to
pay
confiscatory
costs
which
they
will
no
opportunity
to
litigate
at
any
later
time,
in
other
words,
the
regulation
either
has
to
be
challenged
now
or
never,
we
think
that
would
be
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
that
would
be
true
with
that
individual
fee
be
mr.
justice
fortas.
but
if
their
allegations
are
true,
i
suppose
they
say
we've
already
paid
--
forced
to
pay
$7
million
with
all
our
2700
petitions
and
to
force
us
to
pay
700
--
$7
million.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
it,
but
i'm
saying
that's
a
different,
it
seems
that's
that
a
difference
case.
if
that
were
true
i
think
this
case
might
be
closer
to
abbott
laboratories.
that
fact
that
that
isn't
true
i
think
is
what
makes
this
case
disappear,
makes
it
much
clearer
than
abbot
laboratories,
because
in
this
case
there
is
no
such
requirement.
the
industry
is
not
being
asked
today
to
pay
$42
million
in
listing
fees
or
forego
using
it's
cosmetics
for
the
next
few
years.
if
that
were
true,
we
think
there
might
be
some
room
for
arguing
that
--
maybe
they
ought
to
be
permitted
to
litigate
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'd
just
take
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
clarify
possibly
this
question
of
course
which
has
come
up
again.
we
submit
that
the
figures
given
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
suit,
is
completely
inflated
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
that
requires
separate
listing
for
each
finished
cosmetic
product.
they
have
the
particular
cosmetic
company
that
produces
2700
cosmetic
products
could,
for
all
we
know,
submit
ten
petitions
to
cover
all
those
2700
products
and
they
would
not
be
required
to
pay
more
than
ten
deposits.
and
those
$2600
fees,
which
the
regulations
provide
for
are
merely
deposits,
they
are
to
cover
the
processing
cost
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
it
can
cover,
it
can
cover
a
whole
range
of
lipsticks
for
example,
the
food
and
drug
administration
will
list
--
let's
say
on
the
basis
of
a
common
base
that
the
20
or
30
lipsticks
have
a
whole
sequence
of
different
colors
that
the
company
may
provide
or
may
supply.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
found
mr.
justice
white
that
the
coloring
ingredient
in
and
of
itself
maybe
harmless,
but
when
it's
combined
with
some
of
the
diluents
that
appear
in
the
cosmetic,
the
product
is
harmful.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
it's
the
combination
of
the
two
that
may
cause
the
harm
they
interact
chemically--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
precisely
that's
exactly
--
that's
all
the
power
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
don't
it
doesn't
have
to
be
separately
listed
that's
exactly
our
point,
they
can
all
be
--
they
will
all
appear
in
the
one
paragraph--
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
well,
because
presumably
the
other
products
in
the
world
that
are
being
combined
with
that
are
being
combined--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
no
realistically
that
they
are
different
from
this
product
because
there
is
a
third
diluent
that's
in,
there
is
another
--
that's
what
distinguishes
them
from
this
and
that
we
don't
know
what
the
coloring
ingredient—
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
then
it
will
not
have
to
separately
listed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
being
statute
specifically
provides
mr.
justice
white
that
the
secretary
or
the
commissioner
has
authorized
to
list
color
ingredients
generally
if
he
feels
that
really
if
it
combined
with
any
other
product
they
will
cause
no
harm.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
there
is
a
possibility
that
it
will
cause
harm
yes,
and
i
think
the
commissioner
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
the
listing
will
say
color
ingredient
a
when
added
to
diluent
a
is
safe
and
no
matter
who
produces
it,
we
don't
care
who
the
manufacturer
is
no
matter
who
produces
he
will
be
permitted
under
the
statute
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
they
are
all
identical
definitely,
but
all
that
we
are
saying
if
they
if
one
had
one
diluent
and
the
other
one
has
two
and
the
third
one
has
three,
they
do
have
to
list
those
which
differ
to
the
extent
they
differ
and
even
the
$2600
cost
if
there
is
nothing,
if
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
would
say
that
the
combination
of
base,
a
base
made
up
of
certain
chemicals
with
a
certain
ingredients
is
permissible,
he
wouldn't,
he
would
list
it
that
way,
he
does
it
with
his
brand
name.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yeah.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
is
listed
in
a
federal
register,
in
the
federal
regulation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
it's
chemically
identical
it's
listed,
you
can
sell
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
every
finished
product
to
the
extent
that
it
differs
not
to
the
extent
that
it's
label
is
different,
not
to
the
extent
that
its
put
up
on
a
different
brand.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
well
i
think
the
regulations
just
speaks
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
not
every
brand,
no
i
don't
think
anybody
has
ever
suggested
that
you
have
got
to
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
it's
chemically
identical
you
don't
have
to
list
it
again,
the
perfect
illustration
is
cellophane
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
regulation
which
covers
a
variety
of
cellophane
product,
it
never
mentions
certainly
particular
brand,
it
just
covers
them
in
one
paragraph
with
a
wide
variety
of
chemical,
different
chemical
products.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
and
we
think
the
same
thing
could
apply
to
a
cosmetic
additive.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
no,
no,
but
it's
just
that
the
very
same
technique
could
be
used
by
the
commissioner
or
will
be
used
by
the
commissioner
in
the
food
field
and
that
the
food
additive
problem
of
course
is
quite
different.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
because
but
the
usual
things
that
are
combined
with
coloring
ingredients
of
food
are
generally
totally
harmless
or
at
least
that
standard
while
obviously
in
cosmetics
there
are,
of
the
kinds
of
the
chemicals
are
being
combined
or
not
the
kind
of
things
you
can
swallow
and
you
just
don't
know,
the
commission
doesn't
know
until
it
is
testing
what,
how
they
interact
with
the
coloring
ingredients.
and
of
course,
finally
so
far
as
costs
are
concerned,
the
ultimate
answer
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
or
any
claim
where
they
objected
of
course
is
to
request
a
reduction
in
cost
if
they
think
that
the
fees
are
higher,
the
deposits
are
too
high
and
since
all
that's
involved
here
is
$2600
deposit
not
a
fee,
but
a
deposit
and
the
total,
the
total
budget
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
last
year
for
preclearance
of
food
additives
in
these
related
areas
was
$1.5
million,
it's
hardly
conceivable
that
$7
million
could
be
spent
on
the
processing
that
the
food
drug
administration
does
in
this
area.
it
doesn't
test
itself
except
to
very
limited
extent,
just
reviews
the
testing
that's
done
by
the
manufacturers.
