justice
potter
stewart
additive
legislative
history
as
i
read
the
briefs
that
they
interviewed
people
who
were
there
at
the
legislative
hearing,
committee
hearings.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
their
point
was
that
you
have
jurisdiction
to
list
or
not
list
or
control
or
have
anything
to
say
about
their
finished
product
as
such,
as
such.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
this
case
then
is
quite
different
from
one
we
just
heard,
abbott?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
understood
you
in
the
abbott
case,
you
said
there
was
really
no
question
about
the
complete
lack
of
ambiguity
that
the
polarity
and
certainty
of
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
there
involved.
and
that,
in
that
sense
at
least
while
you
use
the
word
abstract,
it
really
wasn't
abstract
it
was,
it's
meaning
was
clear,
its
meets
and
bounds
were
clear
and
here
you
say
that
is
not
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
at
least
they
are
arguing
about
the
need.
justice
potter
stewart
in
abbott
there
was
no
argument
at
all
about
the
meaning.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
they
disagree
with
you
but
in
that
respect
this
case
is
different,
and
then
you
do
disagree
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
regulations,
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
impact.
justice
potter
stewart
expect
in
degree
there,
what's
the
difference?
the
question
is,
is
the
power
of
the
agency
to
do
what
it
did
under
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
by
contrast
with
the
abbott
case
the
government
is
not
asking
us
to
adjudicate
the
merits--
justice
potter
stewart
they're
asking
us
not
to--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
for
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
food
additive,
that's
a
food
additive.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah
with
the
cellophane
question
it
doesn't,
it
never
comes
under
the
cosmetic
products.
justice
potter
stewart
quite
different,
yes.
