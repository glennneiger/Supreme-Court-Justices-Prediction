mr.
edward
j.
ross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
distinction
between
the
cosmetic
case
and
the
abbott
laboratories
case
has
not
really
been
set
forth
yet,
and
this
is
the
distinction.
in
abbott
laboratories,
congress
did
in
fact
legislate
a
requirement
that
there
would
be
prominence
to
the
generic
name.
and
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
regulations
properly
implemented
a
power
which
was
granted
to
the
agency
and
that's
probably
why
their
complaint
alleges
the
unreasonableness
of
the
regulation.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
issue
in
our
case.
our
case
is
one
where
congress
never
granted
a
power
to
the
agency.
the
agency
allocated
to
itself,
it
took
new
and
different
powers
from
those
which
congress
granted.
in
fact
it
took
powers
which
it
requested
of
congress
and
which
congress
refused
to
grant
by
declining
to
enact
the
legislation
which
would
have
accomplished
the
power,
which
was
ultimately
taken
by
the
regulations.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well,
it's
a
question
of
degree,
but
a
very
substantial
degree.
what
was
done
here
your
honor
was
to
subject
an
industry
which
was
not
subject
to
getting
a
license
before
it
could
sell
it's
products,
to
getting
a
license.
now
before
any
finished
cosmetic
product
which
imparts
the
color
to
the
body
may
be
sold.
that
product
must
be
pre-cleared
by
fda
and
there
must
be
a
license
for
it
and
the
statute
doesn't
require
this
kind
of
a
license,
it
requires
a
license
for
one
ingredient,
the
color
which
was
added
to
the
product,
not
for
the
entire
product.
now
the
hair
dye
allegation
illustrates
this
very
clearly.
the
statue
says
that
hair
dyes
are
exempt
they're
exempt
if
they
bear
a
certain
kind
of
label
which
is
very
specifically
provided
for
by
the
statute.
the
exemption
is
so
complete
that
even
the
provision
with
respect
to
clearing
the
color
ingredient
that
if
it
is
not
a
hair
dye
so
that
the
color
in
the
hair
dye
doesn't
have
to
be
cleared
by
the
agency,
nevertheless
the
agency
rewrote
the
statute,
changed
its
provisions
and
said
from
now
on,
the
entire
hair
dye
product
must
pre-cleared
by
the
food
and
drug
administration,
it
may
not
be
sold
unless
it
gets
this
prior
license
and
it
may
not
be
sold
unless
we
list
it
in
a
regulation
and
this
listing
means
setting
forth
the
specifications
and
formulas
of
the
product
or
at
least
the
trade
secrets,
they
must
be
published
in
the
federal
register
for
all
competitors
the
same
copy
if
they
want
and
then
certifying
the
batches
of
it.
now
these
are
substantially
new
and
substantially
different
powers
from
those
which
were
intended
to
be
given
to
the
agency
by
congress.
and
the
proof
of
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
on
repeated
occasions
fda
sponsored
legislation
in
which
it
urged
that
it
was
desired
to
impose
this
kind
of
a
license
on
finished
cosmetic
products.
innumerable
bills
were
introduced
for
the
pre-clearance
of
cosmetics
and
these
were
never
enacted,
some
cases
after
hearing
as
to
the
necessity
of
this
legislation.
there
were
several
bills
introduced
to
eliminate
the
statutory
exemption
for
hair
dyes,
they
were
not
inactive.
it
was
legislation
introduced
to
give
the
food
and
drug
administration
access
to
the
formulas
of
all
products
covered
by
the
act
and
congress
examined
this
very
critically
and
enacted
a
provision
that
they
would
have
access
only
to
the
formulas
of
prescription
drugs
and
not
to
the
formulas
of
nonprescription
drugs
or
the
formulas
of
cosmetics
or
the
formulas
of
food
or
the
formulas
of
devices.
now
this
is
the
kind
of
allocation
of
power
to
an
agency,
which
has
always
been
reviewable
as
early
as
stark
v.
wickard,
this
court
held
that
it
was
an
inherent
judicial
function
by
injunction
in
equity
to
challenge
this
type
of
excessive
power
and
the
only
time
it
could
not
be
challenged
if
there
was
a
specific
provision
in
the
statute
which
prevented
challenge,
they
said
mere
silence
was
not
sufficient.
this
was
the
decision
in
the
frozen
food
case
where
this
court
will
recall
it
said
that
what
was
being
done
there
was
to
license
an
industry
or
require
licensing
for
an
industry
where
the
act
require
it
and
it
was
allowed
to
be
challenged
in
equity
by
an
injunction
action.
this
is
the
very
classic
kind
of
a
case
in
which
the
declaratory
judgment's
law
was
designed.
this
is
what
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
saying
if
you
don't
believe
these
regulations
are
valid,
ignore
them
and
then
face
the
penalties
of
being
wrong
or
even
face
the
penalties
of
being
right
because
as
mr.
gazelle
said
the
headlines,
the
cosmetics
which
are
carefully
tested
and
as
to
which
the
companies
are
very
jealous
of
their
reputation
and
goodwill,
there
were
headlines
of
multiple
seizures
because
the
products
were
adulterated,
this
would
ruin
the
industry.
now
in
this
field,
you
can't
have
multiple
seizures
because
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
matter
of
labeling,
we
are
dealing
with
products
which
will
be
called
adulterated
in
the
public
press,
if
they
are
sold
without
complying
with
the
licensed
provision
which
we
assert
in
the
claim,
is
illegal
and
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
i
hope
then
--
i
would
say--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
i,
i
don't
believe
it
is
because
if
you
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
listing
the
color.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
maybe
i
don't
understand.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
you
are
saying
that
if
fda
wants
to
determine
that
a
particular
color
ingredient--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
oh!
any
ingredient?
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
don't
know
of
any
provision,
they
would
have
to--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
they
could
--
if
they
were
adulterated,
then
the
product
could
be
ceased
after
sale,
there
is
a
post
marketing
power
after
sale.
there
is
no
premarketing
clearance
of
cosmetic,
there
is
a
premarketing
clearance
of
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
classic
case
where
the
expertise
of
the
agency
would
be
involved
and
any
court
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well
it
did
and
principally
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history,
they
wanted
to
have
the
testimony
as
to
what
type
of
technical
problem
was
involved
in
particularly
testimony
from
those
who
help
to
shape
the
legislative
history.
but
just
to
finish
my
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
question
of
the
safety
or
propriety
of
a
particular
ingredient
and
that
is
the
matter
for
these
special
components
of
expertise
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
and
normally,
i
would
say
that
the
proper
procedure
would
be
to
go
before
the
agency,
have
your
evidentiary
hearing,
obtain
your
findings
and
then
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
based
upon
that
record.
the
reason
i
expressed
doubt
is
because
in
connection
with
this
case
for
the
first
time
i
heard
the
government
say
that
the
saving
cost
in
the
statute
is
not
a
broad
saving
cost
as
the
courts
below
held
and
as
i
always
understood
it
can
be,
but
it
was
a
saving
cost
to
give
two
remedies
for
the
type
of
case
that
involved
this
administrative
hearing.
they
say
in
their
brief
and
it
was
said
in
the
oral
argument
that
the
saving
cost
applies
only
to
those
proceedings
to
which
the
administrative
procedure
applies,
and
is
an
additional
remedy
doesn't
apply
to
a
remedy
such
as
we
have
sought
here
and
that's
why
and
that
came
as
a
surprise
to
me
which
is
why
i
said,
i
was
doubtful
to
what
the
answer
was.
but
normally
i
would
say
this
is
a
type
of
proceeding
that
goes
before
administrative
agency
with
administrative
hearings
involving
the
special
competence
and
expertise
of
the
agency
with
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
this
is
of
course
not
the
issue
with
respect
to
whether
the
statute
goes
as
far
as
these
regulations
and
i
might
note
this
is
conceded
by
the
government
because
in
their
brief
they
say
if
they
are
wrong
as
to
reviewability
nature,
they
don't
think
any
evidence
is
needed
for
a
trial
and
the
record
as
it
now
stands
is
sufficient
for
the
court
to
adjudicate
this
issue
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
they
are
not
they
are
askingâ€“-
mr.
edward
j.
ross
that's
correct
what
they
are
saying
is
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
denying
my
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
opposed
by
the
government
and
they
say
the
district
court
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
the
court
could
now
determine
these
as
questions
of
law
without
the
necessity
of
any
further
evidence
and
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief
where
in
fact
someone
filed
objections
before
the
administrative
agency
and
to
a
different
regulation
and
urged
as
a
ground
for
objection,
that
there
was
no
authority
in
the
statute.
they
refused
to
accept
these
objections
of
compelling
and
they
raised
issues
of
law,
which
couldn't
be
covered
in
administrative
hearing,
which
is
exactly
our
opposition
on
this
case.
i
would
like
briefly
to
answer
mr.
lewin's
argument
with
respect
to
the
right
of
speech.
it
is
based
in
my
judgment
on
a
misreading
of
the
regulations.
the
regulations
apply
now,
the
statute
is
very
plain
it
says
that
if
something
is
a
color
additive
it
must
now
be
listed
and
certified
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
so
anything
which
the
regulation
defines
to
be
a
color
additive
requires
this
license
before
it
may
be
sold.
the
regulations
say
in
their
definitions
that
a
diluent
is
a
color
additive
and
therefore
it
follows
that
the
diluents
must
now
be
listed
and
must
now
be
subject
to
certification.
regulations
further
say
that
lipstick,
rouge,
eye
make-up
colors
and
all
related
cosmetics
for
coloring
of
body
are
color
additives.
these
color
additives,
if
they
are
color
additives
a
license
is
now
required,
a
listing
petition
must
be
presented
which
must
be
accompanied
by
the
$
2,600
fee.
now
in
the
discovery
proceedings
which
we
had
to
try
to
clarify
the
intent
of
its
regulation,
it
was
very
clearly
testified
to
by
the
deputy
commissioner
of
food
and
drug
administration
with
reference
to
this
2,700
cosmetics
of
kolmar
laboratories
that
if
as
we
cite
each
one
is
a
different
formula
that
a
separate
petition
would
have
to
be
filed
for
each
of
these
2700
cosmetics
and
a
separate
fee
of
$2600
would
be
payable.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well,
the
trust
was
multiple,
we
were
seeking
to
list
as
much
of
a
background
as
we
could,
statements
that
were
made
by
food
and
drug
officials
as
to
what
was
intended
to
be
covered.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
that's
correct
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
doubt
it
now
but
the
court
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well
it
was
new
to
me
but
the
court
said
to
do
it
so
i
did
it.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
court
felt
that
my
guess
is
and
i'm
only
speculating
on
what
was
in
the
judicial
mind
that
this
was
a
very
substantial
issue
and
district
courts
are
very
often
reluctant
to
decide
broad
issues
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
but
with
government
opposing
summary
judgment
they
felt
they
ought
to
have
a
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well,
this
is
what
he
wanted,
he
was
doubtful
about
it,
many
times
in
conference
in
chambers
he
indicated
that
perhaps
he
was
wrong
and
he
was
charting
a
new
cost
that
wasn't
sound,
but
anyway,
it
was
his
idea
that
there
ought
to
be
this
kind
of
probing
before
he
would
determine
this
issue,
but
he
was
very
firm
in
his
mind,
that
the
issue
was
one
of
statutory
construction.
he
thought
that
these
depositions
and
interrogatories
might
throw
some
light
on
what
the
statutory
construction
was
and
they
did
because
i'm
going
outside
the
record
of
course
this
much
of
this
wasn't
made
part
of
the
motion
papers
of
the
government
on
a
renewed
motion.
but
what
is
included
in
the
record
are
statements
to
the
effect
by,
testimony
by
fda
officials
that
each
cosmetic
would
require
a
listing
and
that
the
listing
is
now
required,
we
put
this
question
to
the
interrogatories
is
a,
each
finished
cosmetic
product,
a
color
additive
and
will
it
now
require
listing.
the
answer
was,
listing
would
be
required,
these
are
answers
to
interrogatories
where
there
is
more
time
to
think
about
it
than
on
the
depositions
which
corroborated
these
answers.
we
received
as
i
said
an
answer
that
if
there
were
2700
separate
products
made
by
kolmar
laboratories
because
it
makes
products
with
variety
of
companies
that
each
one
would
require
a
separate
listing
petition
and
each
one
would
require
a
separate
fee
of
$
2600.
we
have
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
pages
of
testimony
which
support
this,
there
was
a
very
thorough
airing
of
what
the
regulations
mean.
in
the
first
time
it
was
suggested
that
these
regulations
might
not
now
be
right
to
review
because
they
don't
apply
now
they
only
apply
at
some
future
date
and
even
that
speculatory
contention
has
been
in
this
court
in
the
proceedings
below
no
one
ever
questions
the
immediacy
of
these
regulations
and
their
impact
upon
the
industry.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
the
essence
of
our
complaint.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
that
is
the
part
of
that
in
the
sense
that
not
only
do
we
wish
to
show
the
excess
of
statutory
authority
and
the
immediate
application
of
the
regulations,
but
also
to
complete
the
picture
that
they
are
burdensome,
they
have
an
impact
on
us
and
would
cause
us
a
irreparable
harm.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
$2600
for
each
cosmetic
that
you
must
get
this
license
for
before
you
can
sell
it,
requires
a
petition
and
each
petition
must
be
accompanied
by
a
filing
fee
of
$2600.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
what?
mr.
edward
j.
ross
a
filing
fee
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well,
that's
the
essence
of
the
charge.
we
have
estimated
based
upon
the
kind
of
testing
which
would
have
to
be
done
for
these
cosmetics,
what
fda
said
would
be
the
testing,
would
cost
this
one
company
about
$8
million
to
perform
the
minimum
testing
and
some
$42
million
to
perform
the
kind
of
testing
which
fda
indicated
it
probably
would
require
because
this
testing
means
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
before
you
get
your
license
to
sell
the
cosmetics.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
testing
the
cosmetic
to
be.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
over
eight
million
yes
sir
because
the
testing
would
have
to
be
performed
for
thousands
of
products.
the
testing
takes
many,
many
years
to
perform
it's
--
what
they
do
is
put
the
lipstick
on
mice
and
beagles
and
do
it
for
seven
or
eight
years
to
see
whether
they
suffer
any
harm
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
are
products
which
have
been
used
for
50
to
100
years.
when
i
ask
fda
how
long
lipstick
of
this
type
were
used
he
said
since
the
days
of
egyptian
times,
these
aren't
new
products
that
are
put
on
the
market,
these
are
products
that
have
been
generally
recognized
as
safe,
have
been
used
for
centuries
by
women,
and
i
might
note
also
that
the
color
ingredient
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
same
color
that's
used
in
food
and
drugs.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
i
think
the
purpose
was
to
take
--
they
feel
they
would
like
to
have
this
power
to
license
cosmetics
when
congress
did
not
give
it
to
them.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
they
say
that's
what,
that's
the
fee
that's
involved
in
obtaining
the
listing.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
they
call
deposit
but
i
never
heard
of
anyone
getting
deposit
back
and
if
got
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
the
deposit
is
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
agencies
testing
it
reviewing
the
application
and
it
is
a
reasonable
deposit
as
it
applies
to
the
dye
because
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
as
applies
to
the
dye
or
the
color
ingredient.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
the
fee
was
established
by
the
agency.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
think
the
statute
would
authorize
a
fee,
we
don't
object
to
the
fee
as
applied
to
the
color
ingredient
we
thinks
it's
a
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
$8
million
dollars
is
the
minimum
cost
of
testing
the
products
of
one
company
that
makes
2700
cosmetics.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
the
company
pays
that
cost.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
that's
right.
because
if
the
company
that
makes
it
for
other
companies
which
then
sell
the
cosmetics
under
different
brand
names,
it's
a
contractor
for
other
companies
that
use
brand
names.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
because
the
government
â€“
it
depends
on
what
we
are
talking
about,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
testing
of
the
dyes
and
color
--
all
the
statute
contemplates
then,
then
there
are
only
a
handful
of
those
colors
and
the
burden
of
testing
them
isn't
too
great
although
the
fda
said
it
will
take
20
years
it
is
a
substantial
burden
but
one
which
the
industry
can
assume.
but
when
you
change
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
say
that
the
finished
cosmetic
product
is
now
the
color
additive
and
it
must
be
tested
and
listed
then
you
are
dealing
with
an
entirely
different
situation
and
one
which
congress
never
encompassed,
isn't
a
word
is
a
long
legislative
history
of
these
amendments,
which
suggest
that
they
were
intending
to
impose
a
requirement
of
premarketing
clearance
on
cosmetics.
the
fact
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief
during
the
hearing
some
congress
woman
said
as
along
as
you
are
dealing
with
the
matter
of
colors,
let's
take
up
the
question
of
the
other
ingredients
of
the
cosmetic,
may
be
some
of
them
should
be
approved.
her
suggestion
wasn't
adopted;
the
congress
did
not
address
itself
to
that.
i
might
i
wanted
express
one
additional
factor
and
that
is
this
that
these
colors
aren't
directed
only
to
cosmetics,
it
so
happens
that
the
definition
hits
the
cosmetic
industry,
but
these
are
colors
which
are
added
to
foods
and
drugs.
now
the
same
color
is
used
in
the
mouthwash
that's
used
in
the
lipstick
and
the
same
color
is
used
in
candy
for
children,
that
is
used
in
the
lipstick
and
obviously
the
ingestion
in
the
food
and
candy
is
far
greater
than
anything
in
the
lipstick.
yet
food
and
drug
administration
approves
these
colors
as
used
in
foods
without
even
suggesting
they
must
pre-clear
the
entire
food
products
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
same
thing
cannot
be
done
with
respect
to
the
cosmetic.
in
fact
when
this
statute
was
enacted
it
was
represented
to
congress
that
what
they
were
doing
was
taking
the
exact
language
of
the
food
additive
amendments
of
1958
which
required
the
testing
and
listing
of
additives
in
foods
and
that
was,
the
safety
for
use
principle
and
applying
it
to
cosmetics.
now
since
1958
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
been
listing
additives
for
foods
and
they
determined
the
tolerance
and
the
maximum
quantity
of
this
additive
that
may
be
used
in
the
food,
but
they
never
said
we
must
give
a
license
to
food
industry
you
can't
sell
the
entire
finished
food
product
until
we
give
you
this
license.
now
this
is
what
has
been
done
with
respectively
cosmetic
industry.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
on
the
contrary
it's
far
less
dangerous
because
for
most
cosmetics,
there
is
no
ingestion
at
all.
rouge
is
put
on
the
face,
lipstick
has
a
bit
of
ingestion
because
the
woman
using
lipsticks
inevitably
swallow
some
as
she
eats.
but
the
additives
that
are
put
into
foods
are
consumed
and
ingested
by
everyone
who
takes
the
food
and
when
they
determine
that
a
certain
quantity
of
a
color
ingredient
is
safe
for
use
in
a
food,
it
isn't
necessary
to
then
test
a
whole
cosmetic
product
to
determine
that
same
quantity
can
be
safely
used
in
the
product.
and
that's
why
we
feel
or
we
would
say
that
the
testing
of
the
entire
product
would
not
be
necessary,
but
this
is
not
the
â€“
the
regulation
that
mr.
lewin
described
is
not
the
one
that's
before
the
court.
if
that
regulation
should
be
issued
than
we
might
challenge
it
on
unreasonableness
to
administrative
hearing.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
requirement
of
a
license
before
you
can
do
business
when
congress
did
not
require
that
license
is
what
is
beyond
the
powers
of
the
agency
and
is
presently
right
to
review.
these
are
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
this
court
of
course
has
many
times
said
in
this
type
of
a
case,
the
complaint
must
be
accepted
as
true
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
there
is
this
controversy.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no,
no,
the
hearing
started
because
this
court
in
fleming
v.
florida
citrus
exchange
decided
that
if
i
a
color
in
a
tremendous
quantity
might
be
harmful
it
couldn't
be
used
even
though
it
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
the
cosmetics--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
there
have
been--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
there
was
such
a
case
with
respect
to
a
type
of
cosmetic,
which
was
more
than
a
cosmetic
that
was
the
anti-wrinkle
cosmetic
which
had
to
qualify
as
a
drug
and
that
came
under
the
drug
regulations
rather
than
the
cosmetic
regulations.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
wouldn't
say
that
i
don't
know
if
they
have
ever
taken
such
a
position,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
maybe
some
ingredient
in
a
cosmetic
which
is
harmful.
and
if
that
was
so,
then
under
that
particular
circumstance
they
might
want
to
look
at
the
entire
product,
but
that's
quite
different
from
requiring
the
license
for
that
product
and
a
separate
fee,
a
separate
test
for
the
entire
product.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
it
is
possible
there
maybe
cases
of
the
latter
pattern.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
right
and
congress
does
authorize
under
the
statute
that
in
determining
whether
you
will
clearly
call
a
additive,
you
can
determine
its
intended
use.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
oh!
no
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
what
i'm
doing
is
basically
--
i
think
i
gave
an
illustration
in
the
brief
that
i
might
restate,
which
illustrates
what
i
have
in
mind.
the
act
--
to
get
off
the
subject
of
cosmetics,
the
act
authorizes
the
food
and
drug
administration
have
certain
powers
over
devices,
now
a
bicycle
fits
the
statutory
definition
of
a
device
because
it's
an
apparatus
that
might
affect
the
structure
of
the
body,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
food
and
drug
administration
came
in
and
said,
now
we're
going
to
regulate
the
whole
bicycle
industry
and
before
anyone
may
sell
a
bicycle,
you
must
get
a
license
from
us
in
advance.
its
inherent
power
of
court
of
equity
come
in
and
say
this
isn't
what
the
statute
intended,
and
isn't
what
the
statute
means
and
this
is
an
excess
of
statutory
power.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
that's
correct
i
was
arguing
by
analogy,
but
at
the
same
time
we
are
dealing
with
an
ingredient
of
a
cosmetic
and
not
with
the
cosmetic
itself,
which
we
say
is
not
subject
to
pre-marketing
clearance,
it's
subject
only
to
post-marketing
jurisdiction.
i
thank
you;
i
think
my
time
is
up,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
distinction
between
the
cosmetic
case
and
the
abbott
laboratories
case
has
not
really
been
set
forth
yet,
and
this
is
the
distinction.
in
abbott
laboratories,
congress
did
in
fact
legislate
a
requirement
that
there
would
be
prominence
to
the
generic
name.
and
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
regulations
properly
implemented
a
power
which
was
granted
to
the
agency
and
that's
probably
why
their
complaint
alleges
the
unreasonableness
of
the
regulation.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
issue
in
our
case.
our
case
is
one
where
congress
never
granted
a
power
to
the
agency.
the
agency
allocated
to
itself,
it
took
new
and
different
powers
from
those
which
congress
granted.
in
fact
it
took
powers
which
it
requested
of
congress
and
which
congress
refused
to
grant
by
declining
to
enact
the
legislation
which
would
have
accomplished
the
power,
which
was
ultimately
taken
by
the
regulations.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well,
it's
a
question
of
degree,
but
a
very
substantial
degree.
what
was
done
here
your
honor
was
to
subject
an
industry
which
was
not
subject
to
getting
a
license
before
it
could
sell
it's
products,
to
getting
a
license.
now
before
any
finished
cosmetic
product
which
imparts
the
color
to
the
body
may
be
sold.
that
product
must
be
pre-cleared
by
fda
and
there
must
be
a
license
for
it
and
the
statute
doesn't
require
this
kind
of
a
license,
it
requires
a
license
for
one
ingredient,
the
color
which
was
added
to
the
product,
not
for
the
entire
product.
now
the
hair
dye
allegation
illustrates
this
very
clearly.
the
statue
says
that
hair
dyes
are
exempt
they're
exempt
if
they
bear
a
certain
kind
of
label
which
is
very
specifically
provided
for
by
the
statute.
the
exemption
is
so
complete
that
even
the
provision
with
respect
to
clearing
the
color
ingredient
that
if
it
is
not
a
hair
dye
so
that
the
color
in
the
hair
dye
doesn't
have
to
be
cleared
by
the
agency,
nevertheless
the
agency
rewrote
the
statute,
changed
its
provisions
and
said
from
now
on,
the
entire
hair
dye
product
must
pre-cleared
by
the
food
and
drug
administration,
it
may
not
be
sold
unless
it
gets
this
prior
license
and
it
may
not
be
sold
unless
we
list
it
in
a
regulation
and
this
listing
means
setting
forth
the
specifications
and
formulas
of
the
product
or
at
least
the
trade
secrets,
they
must
be
published
in
the
federal
register
for
all
competitors
the
same
copy
if
they
want
and
then
certifying
the
batches
of
it.
now
these
are
substantially
new
and
substantially
different
powers
from
those
which
were
intended
to
be
given
to
the
agency
by
congress.
and
the
proof
of
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
on
repeated
occasions
fda
sponsored
legislation
in
which
it
urged
that
it
was
desired
to
impose
this
kind
of
a
license
on
finished
cosmetic
products.
innumerable
bills
were
introduced
for
the
pre-clearance
of
cosmetics
and
these
were
never
enacted,
some
cases
after
hearing
as
to
the
necessity
of
this
legislation.
there
were
several
bills
introduced
to
eliminate
the
statutory
exemption
for
hair
dyes,
they
were
not
inactive.
it
was
legislation
introduced
to
give
the
food
and
drug
administration
access
to
the
formulas
of
all
products
covered
by
the
act
and
congress
examined
this
very
critically
and
enacted
a
provision
that
they
would
have
access
only
to
the
formulas
of
prescription
drugs
and
not
to
the
formulas
of
nonprescription
drugs
or
the
formulas
of
cosmetics
or
the
formulas
of
food
or
the
formulas
of
devices.
now
this
is
the
kind
of
allocation
of
power
to
an
agency,
which
has
always
been
reviewable
as
early
as
stark
v.
wickard,
this
court
held
that
it
was
an
inherent
judicial
function
by
injunction
in
equity
to
challenge
this
type
of
excessive
power
and
the
only
time
it
could
not
be
challenged
if
there
was
a
specific
provision
in
the
statute
which
prevented
challenge,
they
said
mere
silence
was
not
sufficient.
this
was
the
decision
in
the
frozen
food
case
where
this
court
will
recall
it
said
that
what
was
being
done
there
was
to
license
an
industry
or
require
licensing
for
an
industry
where
the
act
require
it
and
it
was
allowed
to
be
challenged
in
equity
by
an
injunction
action.
this
is
the
very
classic
kind
of
a
case
in
which
the
declaratory
judgment's
law
was
designed.
this
is
what
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
saying
if
you
don't
believe
these
regulations
are
valid,
ignore
them
and
then
face
the
penalties
of
being
wrong
or
even
face
the
penalties
of
being
right
because
as
mr.
gazelle
said
the
headlines,
the
cosmetics
which
are
carefully
tested
and
as
to
which
the
companies
are
very
jealous
of
their
reputation
and
goodwill,
there
were
headlines
of
multiple
seizures
because
the
products
were
adulterated,
this
would
ruin
the
industry.
now
in
this
field,
you
can't
have
multiple
seizures
because
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
matter
of
labeling,
we
are
dealing
with
products
which
will
be
called
adulterated
in
the
public
press,
if
they
are
sold
without
complying
with
the
licensed
provision
which
we
assert
in
the
claim,
is
illegal
and
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
i
hope
then
--
i
would
say--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
i,
i
don't
believe
it
is
because
if
you
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
listing
the
color.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
maybe
i
don't
understand.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
you
are
saying
that
if
fda
wants
to
determine
that
a
particular
color
ingredient--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
oh!
any
ingredient?
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
don't
know
of
any
provision,
they
would
have
to--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
they
could
--
if
they
were
adulterated,
then
the
product
could
be
ceased
after
sale,
there
is
a
post
marketing
power
after
sale.
there
is
no
premarketing
clearance
of
cosmetic,
there
is
a
premarketing
clearance
of
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
classic
case
where
the
expertise
of
the
agency
would
be
involved
and
any
court
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well
it
did
and
principally
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history,
they
wanted
to
have
the
testimony
as
to
what
type
of
technical
problem
was
involved
in
particularly
testimony
from
those
who
help
to
shape
the
legislative
history.
but
just
to
finish
my
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
question
of
the
safety
or
propriety
of
a
particular
ingredient
and
that
is
the
matter
for
these
special
components
of
expertise
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
and
normally,
i
would
say
that
the
proper
procedure
would
be
to
go
before
the
agency,
have
your
evidentiary
hearing,
obtain
your
findings
and
then
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
based
upon
that
record.
the
reason
i
expressed
doubt
is
because
in
connection
with
this
case
for
the
first
time
i
heard
the
government
say
that
the
saving
cost
in
the
statute
is
not
a
broad
saving
cost
as
the
courts
below
held
and
as
i
always
understood
it
can
be,
but
it
was
a
saving
cost
to
give
two
remedies
for
the
type
of
case
that
involved
this
administrative
hearing.
they
say
in
their
brief
and
it
was
said
in
the
oral
argument
that
the
saving
cost
applies
only
to
those
proceedings
to
which
the
administrative
procedure
applies,
and
is
an
additional
remedy
doesn't
apply
to
a
remedy
such
as
we
have
sought
here
and
that's
why
and
that
came
as
a
surprise
to
me
which
is
why
i
said,
i
was
doubtful
to
what
the
answer
was.
but
normally
i
would
say
this
is
a
type
of
proceeding
that
goes
before
administrative
agency
with
administrative
hearings
involving
the
special
competence
and
expertise
of
the
agency
with
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
this
is
of
course
not
the
issue
with
respect
to
whether
the
statute
goes
as
far
as
these
regulations
and
i
might
note
this
is
conceded
by
the
government
because
in
their
brief
they
say
if
they
are
wrong
as
to
reviewability
nature,
they
don't
think
any
evidence
is
needed
for
a
trial
and
the
record
as
it
now
stands
is
sufficient
for
the
court
to
adjudicate
this
issue
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
they
are
not
they
are
askingâ€“-
mr.
edward
j.
ross
that's
correct
what
they
are
saying
is
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
denying
my
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
opposed
by
the
government
and
they
say
the
district
court
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
the
court
could
now
determine
these
as
questions
of
law
without
the
necessity
of
any
further
evidence
and
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief
where
in
fact
someone
filed
objections
before
the
administrative
agency
and
to
a
different
regulation
and
urged
as
a
ground
for
objection,
that
there
was
no
authority
in
the
statute.
they
refused
to
accept
these
objections
of
compelling
and
they
raised
issues
of
law,
which
couldn't
be
covered
in
administrative
hearing,
which
is
exactly
our
opposition
on
this
case.
i
would
like
briefly
to
answer
mr.
lewin's
argument
with
respect
to
the
right
of
speech.
it
is
based
in
my
judgment
on
a
misreading
of
the
regulations.
the
regulations
apply
now,
the
statute
is
very
plain
it
says
that
if
something
is
a
color
additive
it
must
now
be
listed
and
certified
by
the
food
and
drug
administration.
so
anything
which
the
regulation
defines
to
be
a
color
additive
requires
this
license
before
it
may
be
sold.
the
regulations
say
in
their
definitions
that
a
diluent
is
a
color
additive
and
therefore
it
follows
that
the
diluents
must
now
be
listed
and
must
now
be
subject
to
certification.
regulations
further
say
that
lipstick,
rouge,
eye
make-up
colors
and
all
related
cosmetics
for
coloring
of
body
are
color
additives.
these
color
additives,
if
they
are
color
additives
a
license
is
now
required,
a
listing
petition
must
be
presented
which
must
be
accompanied
by
the
$
2,600
fee.
now
in
the
discovery
proceedings
which
we
had
to
try
to
clarify
the
intent
of
its
regulation,
it
was
very
clearly
testified
to
by
the
deputy
commissioner
of
food
and
drug
administration
with
reference
to
this
2,700
cosmetics
of
kolmar
laboratories
that
if
as
we
cite
each
one
is
a
different
formula
that
a
separate
petition
would
have
to
be
filed
for
each
of
these
2700
cosmetics
and
a
separate
fee
of
$2600
would
be
payable.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well,
the
trust
was
multiple,
we
were
seeking
to
list
as
much
of
a
background
as
we
could,
statements
that
were
made
by
food
and
drug
officials
as
to
what
was
intended
to
be
covered.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
that's
correct
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
doubt
it
now
but
the
court
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well
it
was
new
to
me
but
the
court
said
to
do
it
so
i
did
it.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
court
felt
that
my
guess
is
and
i'm
only
speculating
on
what
was
in
the
judicial
mind
that
this
was
a
very
substantial
issue
and
district
courts
are
very
often
reluctant
to
decide
broad
issues
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
but
with
government
opposing
summary
judgment
they
felt
they
ought
to
have
a
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well,
this
is
what
he
wanted,
he
was
doubtful
about
it,
many
times
in
conference
in
chambers
he
indicated
that
perhaps
he
was
wrong
and
he
was
charting
a
new
cost
that
wasn't
sound,
but
anyway,
it
was
his
idea
that
there
ought
to
be
this
kind
of
probing
before
he
would
determine
this
issue,
but
he
was
very
firm
in
his
mind,
that
the
issue
was
one
of
statutory
construction.
he
thought
that
these
depositions
and
interrogatories
might
throw
some
light
on
what
the
statutory
construction
was
and
they
did
because
i'm
going
outside
the
record
of
course
this
much
of
this
wasn't
made
part
of
the
motion
papers
of
the
government
on
a
renewed
motion.
but
what
is
included
in
the
record
are
statements
to
the
effect
by,
testimony
by
fda
officials
that
each
cosmetic
would
require
a
listing
and
that
the
listing
is
now
required,
we
put
this
question
to
the
interrogatories
is
a,
each
finished
cosmetic
product,
a
color
additive
and
will
it
now
require
listing.
the
answer
was,
listing
would
be
required,
these
are
answers
to
interrogatories
where
there
is
more
time
to
think
about
it
than
on
the
depositions
which
corroborated
these
answers.
we
received
as
i
said
an
answer
that
if
there
were
2700
separate
products
made
by
kolmar
laboratories
because
it
makes
products
with
variety
of
companies
that
each
one
would
require
a
separate
listing
petition
and
each
one
would
require
a
separate
fee
of
$
2600.
we
have
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
pages
of
testimony
which
support
this,
there
was
a
very
thorough
airing
of
what
the
regulations
mean.
in
the
first
time
it
was
suggested
that
these
regulations
might
not
now
be
right
to
review
because
they
don't
apply
now
they
only
apply
at
some
future
date
and
even
that
speculatory
contention
has
been
in
this
court
in
the
proceedings
below
no
one
ever
questions
the
immediacy
of
these
regulations
and
their
impact
upon
the
industry.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
the
essence
of
our
complaint.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
that
is
the
part
of
that
in
the
sense
that
not
only
do
we
wish
to
show
the
excess
of
statutory
authority
and
the
immediate
application
of
the
regulations,
but
also
to
complete
the
picture
that
they
are
burdensome,
they
have
an
impact
on
us
and
would
cause
us
a
irreparable
harm.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
$2600
for
each
cosmetic
that
you
must
get
this
license
for
before
you
can
sell
it,
requires
a
petition
and
each
petition
must
be
accompanied
by
a
filing
fee
of
$2600.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
what?
mr.
edward
j.
ross
a
filing
fee
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
well,
that's
the
essence
of
the
charge.
we
have
estimated
based
upon
the
kind
of
testing
which
would
have
to
be
done
for
these
cosmetics,
what
fda
said
would
be
the
testing,
would
cost
this
one
company
about
$8
million
to
perform
the
minimum
testing
and
some
$42
million
to
perform
the
kind
of
testing
which
fda
indicated
it
probably
would
require
because
this
testing
means
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
before
you
get
your
license
to
sell
the
cosmetics.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
testing
the
cosmetic
to
be.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
over
eight
million
yes
sir
because
the
testing
would
have
to
be
performed
for
thousands
of
products.
the
testing
takes
many,
many
years
to
perform
it's
--
what
they
do
is
put
the
lipstick
on
mice
and
beagles
and
do
it
for
seven
or
eight
years
to
see
whether
they
suffer
any
harm
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
are
products
which
have
been
used
for
50
to
100
years.
when
i
ask
fda
how
long
lipstick
of
this
type
were
used
he
said
since
the
days
of
egyptian
times,
these
aren't
new
products
that
are
put
on
the
market,
these
are
products
that
have
been
generally
recognized
as
safe,
have
been
used
for
centuries
by
women,
and
i
might
note
also
that
the
color
ingredient
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
same
color
that's
used
in
food
and
drugs.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
i
think
the
purpose
was
to
take
--
they
feel
they
would
like
to
have
this
power
to
license
cosmetics
when
congress
did
not
give
it
to
them.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
they
say
that's
what,
that's
the
fee
that's
involved
in
obtaining
the
listing.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
they
call
deposit
but
i
never
heard
of
anyone
getting
deposit
back
and
if
got
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
the
deposit
is
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
agencies
testing
it
reviewing
the
application
and
it
is
a
reasonable
deposit
as
it
applies
to
the
dye
because
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
as
applies
to
the
dye
or
the
color
ingredient.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
the
fee
was
established
by
the
agency.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
think
the
statute
would
authorize
a
fee,
we
don't
object
to
the
fee
as
applied
to
the
color
ingredient
we
thinks
it's
a
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
$8
million
dollars
is
the
minimum
cost
of
testing
the
products
of
one
company
that
makes
2700
cosmetics.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
the
company
pays
that
cost.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
that's
right.
because
if
the
company
that
makes
it
for
other
companies
which
then
sell
the
cosmetics
under
different
brand
names,
it's
a
contractor
for
other
companies
that
use
brand
names.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
because
the
government
â€“
it
depends
on
what
we
are
talking
about,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
testing
of
the
dyes
and
color
--
all
the
statute
contemplates
then,
then
there
are
only
a
handful
of
those
colors
and
the
burden
of
testing
them
isn't
too
great
although
the
fda
said
it
will
take
20
years
it
is
a
substantial
burden
but
one
which
the
industry
can
assume.
but
when
you
change
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
say
that
the
finished
cosmetic
product
is
now
the
color
additive
and
it
must
be
tested
and
listed
then
you
are
dealing
with
an
entirely
different
situation
and
one
which
congress
never
encompassed,
isn't
a
word
is
a
long
legislative
history
of
these
amendments,
which
suggest
that
they
were
intending
to
impose
a
requirement
of
premarketing
clearance
on
cosmetics.
the
fact
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief
during
the
hearing
some
congress
woman
said
as
along
as
you
are
dealing
with
the
matter
of
colors,
let's
take
up
the
question
of
the
other
ingredients
of
the
cosmetic,
may
be
some
of
them
should
be
approved.
her
suggestion
wasn't
adopted;
the
congress
did
not
address
itself
to
that.
i
might
i
wanted
express
one
additional
factor
and
that
is
this
that
these
colors
aren't
directed
only
to
cosmetics,
it
so
happens
that
the
definition
hits
the
cosmetic
industry,
but
these
are
colors
which
are
added
to
foods
and
drugs.
now
the
same
color
is
used
in
the
mouthwash
that's
used
in
the
lipstick
and
the
same
color
is
used
in
candy
for
children,
that
is
used
in
the
lipstick
and
obviously
the
ingestion
in
the
food
and
candy
is
far
greater
than
anything
in
the
lipstick.
yet
food
and
drug
administration
approves
these
colors
as
used
in
foods
without
even
suggesting
they
must
pre-clear
the
entire
food
products
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
same
thing
cannot
be
done
with
respect
to
the
cosmetic.
in
fact
when
this
statute
was
enacted
it
was
represented
to
congress
that
what
they
were
doing
was
taking
the
exact
language
of
the
food
additive
amendments
of
1958
which
required
the
testing
and
listing
of
additives
in
foods
and
that
was,
the
safety
for
use
principle
and
applying
it
to
cosmetics.
now
since
1958
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
been
listing
additives
for
foods
and
they
determined
the
tolerance
and
the
maximum
quantity
of
this
additive
that
may
be
used
in
the
food,
but
they
never
said
we
must
give
a
license
to
food
industry
you
can't
sell
the
entire
finished
food
product
until
we
give
you
this
license.
now
this
is
what
has
been
done
with
respectively
cosmetic
industry.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
on
the
contrary
it's
far
less
dangerous
because
for
most
cosmetics,
there
is
no
ingestion
at
all.
rouge
is
put
on
the
face,
lipstick
has
a
bit
of
ingestion
because
the
woman
using
lipsticks
inevitably
swallow
some
as
she
eats.
but
the
additives
that
are
put
into
foods
are
consumed
and
ingested
by
everyone
who
takes
the
food
and
when
they
determine
that
a
certain
quantity
of
a
color
ingredient
is
safe
for
use
in
a
food,
it
isn't
necessary
to
then
test
a
whole
cosmetic
product
to
determine
that
same
quantity
can
be
safely
used
in
the
product.
and
that's
why
we
feel
or
we
would
say
that
the
testing
of
the
entire
product
would
not
be
necessary,
but
this
is
not
the
â€“
the
regulation
that
mr.
lewin
described
is
not
the
one
that's
before
the
court.
if
that
regulation
should
be
issued
than
we
might
challenge
it
on
unreasonableness
to
administrative
hearing.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
requirement
of
a
license
before
you
can
do
business
when
congress
did
not
require
that
license
is
what
is
beyond
the
powers
of
the
agency
and
is
presently
right
to
review.
these
are
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
this
court
of
course
has
many
times
said
in
this
type
of
a
case,
the
complaint
must
be
accepted
as
true
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
there
is
this
controversy.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no,
no,
the
hearing
started
because
this
court
in
fleming
v.
florida
citrus
exchange
decided
that
if
i
a
color
in
a
tremendous
quantity
might
be
harmful
it
couldn't
be
used
even
though
it
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
no
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
the
cosmetics--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
there
have
been--
mr.
edward
j.
ross
there
was
such
a
case
with
respect
to
a
type
of
cosmetic,
which
was
more
than
a
cosmetic
that
was
the
anti-wrinkle
cosmetic
which
had
to
qualify
as
a
drug
and
that
came
under
the
drug
regulations
rather
than
the
cosmetic
regulations.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
wouldn't
say
that
i
don't
know
if
they
have
ever
taken
such
a
position,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
maybe
some
ingredient
in
a
cosmetic
which
is
harmful.
and
if
that
was
so,
then
under
that
particular
circumstance
they
might
want
to
look
at
the
entire
product,
but
that's
quite
different
from
requiring
the
license
for
that
product
and
a
separate
fee,
a
separate
test
for
the
entire
product.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
it
is
possible
there
maybe
cases
of
the
latter
pattern.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
right
and
congress
does
authorize
under
the
statute
that
in
determining
whether
you
will
clearly
call
a
additive,
you
can
determine
its
intended
use.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
oh!
no
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
ross
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
what
i'm
doing
is
basically
--
i
think
i
gave
an
illustration
in
the
brief
that
i
might
restate,
which
illustrates
what
i
have
in
mind.
the
act
--
to
get
off
the
subject
of
cosmetics,
the
act
authorizes
the
food
and
drug
administration
have
certain
powers
over
devices,
now
a
bicycle
fits
the
statutory
definition
of
a
device
because
it's
an
apparatus
that
might
affect
the
structure
of
the
body,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
food
and
drug
administration
came
in
and
said,
now
we're
going
to
regulate
the
whole
bicycle
industry
and
before
anyone
may
sell
a
bicycle,
you
must
get
a
license
from
us
in

come
in

say
this

what
the

isn't

the
statute
means
and
this
is
an
excess
of
statutory

mr.

that's
correct
i
was
arguing
by
analogy,
but
at
the
same
time
we
are
dealing
with
an
ingredient
of
a
cosmetic
and
not
with
the
cosmetic
itself,
which
we
say
is
not
subject
to
pre-marketing
clearance,
it's
subject
only
to
post-marketing
jurisdiction.
i
thank
you;
i
think
my
time
is
up,
thank
you
very
much.
