justice
byron
r.
white
i
notice
the
parties
took
pretrial
discovery,
they
took
about
a
year
for
pretrial
discovery.
what
were
the
issues?
can
you
enlighten
about
that
as
to
which
they
took
the
pretrial
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
fee
or
a
deposit?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
deposit
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
one
petition
cover
many
cosmetic
products?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
explanation
so
on
for
the
government
saying
well
there
maybe
20
different
lipsticks
which
has,
each
of
which
has
only
one
color
ingredient,
one
color
additive
in
each
of
them
and
yet
we
are
not
going
to
just
list
the
color
additive
as
safe
for
use
and
we
are
going
to
require
every
lipstick
that
has
this
color
additive
units
be
separately
certified
or
separately
listed
then
what
does
it
imply?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not,
why
not
list
the
diluents
and
the
additives?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
don't
list
diluents
that
are
harmful
and
that
with
certain
additives,
we
won't
clear
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
why
do
you
have
to
have
two
goals
at
it,
both
the
color
additives
the
diluents
and
the
lipstick.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
you
get
a
case
which
presents
the
question
of
whether
if
one
additive
is
safe
to
be
used
with
this
diluents,
once
you've
decided
that
why
do
you
have
to
have
every
other
product
in
the
world
that's
got
those
two
products
to
be
separately
listed
--
once
you
have
made
the
decision,
why
do
you
have
to
do
it
over
and
over
and
over
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
presumably
but
there's
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
regulation
will
cover
the
situation
where
this
other
lipstick
has
only
those
same
two
products?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
that
exemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
haven't,
you
said
--
you
say
you
wanted
to
get
it
to
final
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
this
one
company
makes
product
a
and
it
got
one
color
additive
and
one
diluent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
file
that
one,
you
listed
$2600
and
then
it
wants
to
sell
product
c
under
another
name
for
another
company,
pack
it
for
another
company
whatever
you
call
it
and
you
say
they
have
to
have
that
listed
too
although.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
is
this
your
answer
to
the
claim
of
2700
separate
listing
for
the
same
--
they
wouldn't
even
have
to
list
in
one
petition
or
in
100
petitions,
all
of
these
products.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
want
to
make
sure,
you
are
saying
that
if
this
situation
took
place
just
possibly,
the
secretary
would
say
not
that
this
product
is
safe,
i
mean
this
particular
brand
is
safe,
what
would
he
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
he
--
he
puts
our
an
order
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whatever
he
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
next
company
decides,
well
i've
got
the
same
product,
i
am
just
going
to
sell
it
no
listing.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
regulation
really
doesn't
mean
what
it
says
does
it,
that
everybody,
you
have
to
list
every,
every
--
justice
byron

white
is
that
what
the
regulation
says?
justice
byron

white
because
then
you
really
don't
have
to
list
every
cosmetic,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
its
brand
or
not,
you
say
you
don't
have
anything
that
the
secretary
is
already
passed
on,
you
don't
need
to

it,
you
don't
