mr.
charles
gordon
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
of
citizenship.
petitioner
is
a
naturalized
citizen
who
voted
in
a
political
election
in
israel.
he
disputes
the
findings
of
the
lower
courts
that
he
thereby
lost
his
citizenship.
the
facts
to
some
extent
were
recited
by
petitioner's
counsel
but
there
are
a
few
more
that
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
there's
a
finding
that
it
was
voluntary.
he
--
mr.
charles
gordon
his
voting
was
voluntary.
he
says
that
he
did
not
thereby
intend
to
give
up
citizenship.
the
government
does
not
--
did
not
in
the
stipulation
agree
to
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
they
did
not
contest
it.
they
--
the
government
says
it's
immaterial.
mr.
charles
gordon
why,
i
believe
that's
one
of
the
issues.
there
are
several
others
that
were
posed
where
congress
can
impose
citizen
--
loss
of
citizenship
against
his
will
where
the
congress
was
acting
reasonably
in
making
such
a
determination
so
forth.
now,
to
some
extent,
the
facts
are
reflected
as
has
been
indicated
in
the
stipulation
of
the
parties.
the
stipulation
is
set
forth
at
pages
11
to
12
of
the
record.
in
addition,
the
certified
passport
file
of
the
department
of
state
was
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
was
considered
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
passport
filed
is
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
petitioner
was
born
in
poland
about
1893.
he
came
to
the
united
states
in
1912
at
the
age
of
19.
he
was
naturalized
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
in
1926
when
he
was
33
years
old.
in
1949,
he
left
the
united
states
with
an
american
passport.
he
then
went
to
israel
in
1950
and
remained
there
for
14
years.
now,
by
his
stipulation,
petitioner
concedes
that
he
voluntary
voted
in
the
election
in
1951
in
israel
for
the
second
knesset
or
parliament.
it
appears
also
from
his
israeli
identification
booklet,
which
your
honors
will
find
at
pages
1
to
2
of
the
record
that
he
voted
additionally
in
two
other
elections
1959
and
--
1955
and
1959
for
the
third
and
fourth
knesset.
now,
it
also
appears
that
following
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
not
sure.
this
was
the
stipulation
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
the
other
--
the
state
department
record
and
this
booklet,
which
is
at
pages
1
and
2
were
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
did
refer
to
the
facts
which
appear
in
the
state
department
record.
so
the
courts
were
considering
that
too.
and
i
don't
think
this
court
is
limited
to
determining
only
on
the
1951
election.
he
voted
in
three
national
elections.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
only
israeli
--
israeli
nation
--
mr.
charles
gordon
could
vote.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
he
did
vote.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
the
passport
file
of
the
department
of
state
was
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
was
considered
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
was
equally
before
the
court
and
it
is
lodged
in
the
files
of
the
clerk
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
the
court
below
--
i
think
they
found
that
on
the
basis
of
that
voting
alone,
they
lost
but
they
had
build
the
facts
and
i
think
this
court
will
consider.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
they
referred
to
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
--
i
agree
with
what
--
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
record
is
a
little
ambiguous.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
agree
with
your
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
true.
he
conceded
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
but
they
in
the
record
and
if
your
honor
will
look
at
pages
1
and
2,
you'll
see
that
the
record
shows
that
he
voted
in
two
other
elections,
1955
and
1959.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
complaint
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
i
don't
know
if
it
does
or
not.
he
hasn't
been
very
talkative
about
these
other
elections.
he
restricts
himself
to
the
first
election
but
he
does
not
deny
and
it
appears
in
the
record
that
he
did
vote
in
the
1955
and
1959
election.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
guess
he
has
been
so
talkative
in
some
state
department
but
in
this
proceeding,
he
has
restricted
--
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
sir.
there
is
testimony
before
the
state
department
board
of
review,
very
full
testimony.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
a
part
of
the
record
that
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
lodged
in
the
office
of
the
clerk,
yes.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
in
my
view,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
agreed
for,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
unfortunate
that
the
record
isn't
filled
up
but
these
materials
were
before
the
district
court.
they
were
part
of
the
record
considered
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
both
courts
have
that
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
the
transcript
of
state
department
file
which
is
certified
by
the
district
court
and
is
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don't
draw
such
a
distinction
but
i
want
to
cover
both
that
in
the
event
as
mr.
justice
clark
has
suggested
that
a
distinction
might
exist
in
the
minds
of
the
court.
i
think
it
covers
both
situations
where
he
was
not
a
citizen
and
voted
and
where
he
was
a
citizen
who
voted.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i'll
be
glad
to
describe
that
to
your
honor.
under
the
law
of
israel,
known
as
the
“law
of
return”,
all
jewish
persons
were
welcome
to
israel;
they
could
become
settlers.
that
law
was
passed
in
1950.
he
went
to
israel
a
month
after
that
law
became
effective.
in
1952,
israel
passed
its
nationality
law,
saying
that
all
jews
who
had
settled
in
israel
under
the
law
of
return
were
automatically
israeli's
citizens
but
they
have
a
right
to
elect
not
to
accept
israeli
citizenship
by
filing
a
written
election.
we
have
passport
which
was
submitted
by
the
petitioner
which
shows
that
israel
regarded
him
as
an
israeli
national,
issued
passport
to
him
and
therefore,
he
did
not
file
such
an
election.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
unfortunately,
this
--
mr.
charles
gordon
because
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
as
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
the
district
court.
as
the
parties
then
conceived
the
issue,
it
was
a
simple
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
based
on
a
single
act
to
voting.
but
i
think
that
in
adjudging
this
--
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
in
issue
of
this
importance
is
very
desirable
to
get
the
record
as
full
as
possible
and
i
think
that
if
the
record
were
as
full
as
it
can
be,
it
would
indicate
that
petitioner
has
demonstrated
his
diminution
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
has
indicated
that
he
regard
himself
as
a
citizen
of
israel.
indeed,
he
did
not
apply
for
an
american
passport
for
ten
years
and
did
apply
for
an
israel
passport
and
obtained
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
the
only
ground
that
is
involved
here
is
voting
in
the
election
of
israel.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
charles
gordon
by
being
naturalized
and
by
some
voluntarily
action
as
part.
that's
conceivable,
i
believe.
but
at
least,
insofar
as
voting
is
concerned,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
statute,
there
must
be
some
indication
of
the
diminished
allegiance
and
my
view
is
that
the
act
of
the
voting
in
itself,
indicates
such
a
diminution.
but
if
it
becomes
important
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
think
the
facts
here
if
fully
developed
would
demonstrate
that
the
allegiance
of
the
petitioner
here
is
primarily
to
israel
or
was
at
that
time
to
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
believe
that
would
if
that
is
considered
important.
in
our
view
of
the
case,
we
believe
the
statute
on
its
face
is
--
is
valid
and
we
would
support
the
statute
on
that
basis.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
wasn't
tried.
it
was
taken
by
the
court
on
stipulation;
united
states
attorney
in
new
york.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
there
is
an
officer
there
who
represents
the
immigration
service
in
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
mr.
charles
gordon
but,
your
honor,
the
--
there's
a
misconception
that
the
case
was
tried
only
on
the
stipulation
of
facts
because
with
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
government
incorporated
by
reference
the
passport
file
of
the
department
of
state
and
it
was
considered
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
your
honor
will
notice
the
opinions
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
contain
facts
which
nowhere
appear
in
the
stipulation.
i
myself
wondered
where
they
got
those
facts
until
i
found
out
that
the
passport
file
of
department
of
state
was
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
there's
no
such
admission.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
only
--
mr.
charles
gordon
but
the
record
includes
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
no.
but
it
cannot
be
ignored
that
this
is
an
official
israeli
identification
booklet
issued
to
the
petitioner.
there's
no
doubt
this
he
submitted.
and
in
it,
it
contains
indications,
notations
by
the
government
that
he
voted
in
the
other
two
elections.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
that
the
case
was
submitted
on
stipulation.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
i
--
i
don't
contend
that.
my
view
is
that
the
case
was
submitted
on
a
stipulation
and
on
the
certified
record
of
the
department
of
state,
which
was
incorporated
in
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
department
of
state
passport
file,
which
is
in
the
office
of
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
at
all.
no
reference
to
it
in
the
brief.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
my
own
view,
your
honor,
is
that
this
additional
material
is
not
relevant.
my
own
view
is
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
in
a
reasonable
determination
by
congress
that
there
is
potential
danger
to
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
if
the
person
--
united
states
citizen
votes
in
the
political
election
of
foreign
country
and
if
he
thereby
indicates
his
diminished
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
well
aware,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
gordon
i've
been
well
aware
to
that
situation,
your
honor,
that's
why
i
stressed
these
additional
facts
which
i
think
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
didn't
quite
say
that,
your
honor.
i
said
that
in
my
view,
i
don't
need
the
additional
record
but
i'm
aware
that
in
the
view
of
some
of
the
justices,
these
facts
may
be
important.
my
view
is
that
the
perez
case
is
still
the
law
that
this
court
is
not
modifying,
that
it
is
sound
and
that
on
the
basis
of
the
perez
case,
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election,
voluntary
voting
is
enough
to
cause
expatriation.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
two
israeli
passports
and
he
--
the
voluntary
becoming
a
citizen
of
israel
was
a
sort
of
a
nega
--
negative
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that's
right.
yes,
he
didn't
file
any
specific
declaration
saying,
“i
want
to
become
a
citizen”
but
he
didn't
take
advantage
of
the
other
opportunity
for
recollection.
i
may
say
that
in
the
state
department
--
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
i
have
it
here.
mr.
charles
gordon
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
certainly
so
that
this
is
not
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
previously.
i
discovered
this
in
my
researches.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
this
was
--
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
i
offer
my
apologies.
i
think
this
is
certainly
a
fault
on
our
part.
these
facts
were
discovered
by
me
in
my
research
in
preparing
for
the
case.
i
deemed
them
to
be
quite
important
as
the
members
of
the
court
do
in
the
disposition
of
this
case
and
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
this
case
were
decided
without
a
full
apprehension
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
these
facts
are
not
briefed.
these
--
the
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
the
--
part
of
them
are
on
my
brief.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
part
of
them
are
referred
to
the
brief.
the
fact
that
there
was
voting
in
the
two
additional
elections
is
referred
to
at
least
twice
in
the
brief.
mr.
charles
gordon
except
for
these
passports.
these
passports
weren't
submitted
by
petitioner
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
they
are
in
the
immigration
record.
they
were
never
before
the
court.
i
mentioned
them
only
because
petitioner
is
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
he
is
a
citizen
and
if
these
documents,
which
bear
i
think
on
his
citizenship
status
are
not
brought
before
the
court.
the
court
may
enter
a
judgment
declaring
him
to
be
a
citizen
when
he
actually
is
not.
i'm
sorry
the
argument
went
off
on
this
pageant
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
our
duty
to
bring
these
facts
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
well,
i
--
i
go
back
to
the
argument.
i
want
to
emphasize
the
possibility
that
in
this
case
and
unfortunately
some
of
these
facts
are
not
fully
developed
in
the
record.
all
of
them
are
in
the
record
except
for
this
passport.
the
indications
that
petitioner
intended
to
become
a
citizen
of
israel.
i
repeat,
in
1950,
he
went
to
israel.
he
lived
there
for
14
years.
he
did
not
apply
for
a
renewal
of
his
american
passport
which
expired
in
1950.
he
did
not
expired
--
applied
for
renewal
for
10
years.
he
did
not
register
with
the
american
embassy
or
consulate.
he
did
obtain
this
israeli
identification
booklet
in
1951.
in
1952,
after
the
new
nationality
law
became
effective,
he
did
obtain
an
israeli
passport.
he
voted
in
three
national
elections.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances,
of
course,
he
didn't
asked
to
retain
his
american
citizenship
when
the
new
israeli
nationality
law
went
into
effect.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances,
petitioner
has
indicated
that
his
primary
allegiance
is
to
israel
and
not
to
the
united
states.
now,
i
want
to
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
some
--
most
of
it
is
before
the
court,
in
my
view.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
it
was
a
part
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
motion.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
not
as
far
as
i'm
aware.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
i
--
i
wouldn't
say
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
that
the
facts
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
there
are
certain
facts
that
relate
to
his
status.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
mr.
justice
white,
this
is
not
uncommon
in
immigration
proceedings.
mr.
charles
gordon
some
of
the
facts
are
in
the
record,
your
honor.
this
is
the
israeli
identi
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
gordon
it's
a
booklet
of
his.
it's
a
--
an
identification
booklet
relating
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
it
is
--
this
is
his
booklet
which
he
submitted
to
us.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
the
only
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
no,
i
don't
agree,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
believe
the
district
court
passed
on
an
actual
case
because
it
is
conceded
that
petitioner
voted
in
the
election
of
1951.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
that
was
enough.
and
my
view
is,
also
that
that
is
enough
but
some
members
of
the
court
may
feel
that
the
additional
facts
which
i
have
suggested
are
relevant
to
the
consideration
of
this
case.
my
view
is,
that
on
the
stipulation
itself
is
concession
that
he
voted
voluntarily
in
a
political
election
in
israel
that
under
the
terms
of
statute
and
under
the
terms
of
perez
caused
him
to
lose
his
citizenship.
now
if
the
court
agrees
that
this
alone
is
sufficient,
then
the
case
is
over.
there's
no
need
to
consider
these
additional
facts.
if
the
court
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
when
these
facts
came
to
light
in
my
research,
this
was
the
time
i
was
preparing
for
argument.
they
were
not
fully
developed
in
the
courts
below.
the
records
were
before
the
court.
the
court
referred
to
some
of
these
facts.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
facts
--
some
of
the
facts
were
referred
to
in
the
opinions
of
the
court.
they
are
not
in
the
stipulation.
some
of
these
additional
facts.
and
i
was
mystified
as
i
said,
when
i
read
the
opinions
of
the
courts
of
where
they
got
these
facts
until
i
learned
that
the
court
had
the
benefit
of
the
certified
record
of
the
state
department.
this
booklet
incidentally
was
not
part
of
the
stipulation.
the
book,
of
which
is
on
pages
1
and
2.
that
was
in
the
state
department
record
and
was
extracted
from
that
record.
were
not
adding
anything
to
the
facts
which
are
considered
by
the
court
below.
the
fact
is,
that
these
--
the
certified
record
of
the
state
department
should
have
been
printed
because
it
was
considered
by
the
court
--
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
but
those
--
that
record
is
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
this
court
and
it
was
considered
by
the
court
below.
i'm
not
really
dragging
this
in
at
the
last
minute.
they
were
considered.
they
should
have
been
briefed
more
fully.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
the
posture
in
which
the
determination
to
affirm
might
be
entered
if
there
question
of
reversal
and
a
determination
that
statute
is
unconstitutional,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
additional
facts
may
be
relevant
in
the
consideration
of
a
majority
that
would
vote
that
way.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
that
differently.
in
my
view,
the
record
in
its
present
shape
is
sufficient
and
in
my
view,
the
record
in
its
present
shape
requires
an
affirmance
of
the
lower
courts.
in
my
view,
the
statute
as
it
was
upheld
in
perez
contemplates
that
the
mere
fact
of
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election,
voluntary
voting
as
is
conceded
here
causes
a
citizen
to
lose
his
nationality.
they
found
correct
in
that,
then
there's
nothing
further
in
the
case.
but
i
suggest
these
additional
facts
in
the
event
the
court
may
determine
their
relevance.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
--
i'm
also
satisfied
to
submit
it
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
exclude
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
definitely
is
the
only
issue
that
we
thought
we
are
bringing
to
this
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
if
your
honor
feels
that
my
duty
to
this
court
permits
me
to
exclude
these
facts,
that's
alright
but
i
thought
the
court
would
want
to
know
these
facts.
the
only
reason
i
brought
them
to
your
attention
is
that
they
may
be
significant
in
the
determination
of
this
issue.
and
they
were
before
the
district
courts.
the
courts
did
consider
them
and
refer
to
them.
mr.
charles
gordon
well
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
there
--
there
are
some
additional
circumstances.
the
court
mentioned
some
--
some
of
the
background
of
this
individual
to
which
i've
referred
in
the
opinions,
they
were
not
in
the
stipulation.
mr.
charles
gordon
because
that
--
that
was
the
only
issue
they
thought
was
significant.
that
alone,
they
said,
was
sufficient
to
uphold
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
perfectly
right,
your
honor,
but
the
district
court
found
that
one
fact
alone.
i
think
the
district
court
indicated
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
go
any
further;
that
this
fact
alone
was
sufficient
to
cause
loss
of
citizenship.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
if
those
facts
are
deemed
broad,
in
my
view,
they're
not
relevant.
in
the
view
of
the
government
at
that
time
they
entered
into
stipulation,
in
the
view
of
the
district
court,
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
those
additional
facts
are
not
relevant.
and
in
my
view,
if
the
court
agrees,
then
there's
nothing
further
to
the
case.
then
the
statute
is
constitutional
and
then
petitioner
lost
his
citizenship.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
think
we
can
leave
the
other
material
aside
if
the
court
agrees
with
me
in
that
position.
if
the
court
finds
that
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election
under
section
401
(e)
under
the
perez
case
itself
expatriate
him
then
there's
nothing
further
to
consider.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i'm
trying
to
be
a
little
predictive
as
to
what
might
be
relevant
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
justices.
and,
i'm
trying
to
bring
to
the
attention
really
the
facts
that
were
considered
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
well
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
trying
to
muddy
the
waters.
i
am
trying
to
give
the
entire
the
record
as
it
was
considered
by
the
district
court
and
only
part
of
it
appears
in
the
stipulation.
this
is
only
one
part
of
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
your
honor,
that
is
not
so.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
knew
about
it.
it
was
before
them.
no,
this
wasn't
hidden
from
anybody.
the
only
regret
i
have
is
that
they
weren't
printed
in
the
record
because
they
were
before
the
court
below.
this
is
not
something
i
dreamed
up.
it
was
considered
fully
in
the
court
below.
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
it
would
depend
on
the
context
and
on
the
understanding
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
--
i
agree
that
that's
a
possibility
but
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
--
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
fully
agree.
i
thought
if
i
did
not
bring
him
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
my
position
and
my
position
is
that
knowing
of
these
facts
and
knowing
that
they
may
be
relevant
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
justices,
it
was
my
obligation
to
bring
them
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
i'm
standing
on
the
statute.
i'm
standing
on
the
opinions
of
the
courts
below.
i
don't
believe,
in
my
view
of
the
statute
that
these
facts
are
relevant.
in
my
view
of
the
statute,
the
mere
fact
of
voting
is
sufficient
to
cause
expatriation.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
realized
that
there
are
some
possibilities
that
it
might
not
stand
and
i
therefore
feel
that
these
facts
may
be
significant
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
justices.
mr.
charles
gordon
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
of
citizenship.
petitioner
is
a
naturalized
citizen
who
voted
in
a
political
election
in
israel.
he
disputes
the
findings
of
the
lower
courts
that
he
thereby
lost
his
citizenship.
the
facts
to
some
extent
were
recited
by
petitioner's
counsel
but
there
are
a
few
more
that
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
there's
a
finding
that
it
was
voluntary.
he
--
mr.
charles
gordon
his
voting
was
voluntary.
he
says
that
he
did
not
thereby
intend
to
give
up
citizenship.
the
government
does
not
--
did
not
in
the
stipulation
agree
to
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
they
did
not
contest
it.
they
--
the
government
says
it's
immaterial.
mr.
charles
gordon
why,
i
believe
that's
one
of
the
issues.
there
are
several
others
that
were
posed
where
congress
can
impose
citizen
--
loss
of
citizenship
against
his
will
where
the
congress
was
acting
reasonably
in
making
such
a
determination
so
forth.
now,
to
some
extent,
the
facts
are
reflected
as
has
been
indicated
in
the
stipulation
of
the
parties.
the
stipulation
is
set
forth
at
pages
11
to
12
of
the
record.
in
addition,
the
certified
passport
file
of
the
department
of
state
was
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
was
considered
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
passport
filed
is
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
petitioner
was
born
in
poland
about
1893.
he
came
to
the
united
states
in
1912
at
the
age
of
19.
he
was
naturalized
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
in
1926
when
he
was
33
years
old.
in
1949,
he
left
the
united
states
with
an
american
passport.
he
then
went
to
israel
in
1950
and
remained
there
for
14
years.
now,
by
his
stipulation,
petitioner
concedes
that
he
voluntary
voted
in
the
election
in
1951
in
israel
for
the
second
knesset
or
parliament.
it
appears
also
from
his
israeli
identification
booklet,
which
your
honors
will
find
at
pages
1
to
2
of
the
record
that
he
voted
additionally
in
two
other
elections
1959
and
--
1955
and
1959
for
the
third
and
fourth
knesset.
now,
it
also
appears
that
following
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
not
sure.
this
was
the
stipulation
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
the
other
--
the
state
department
record
and
this
booklet,
which
is
at
pages
1
and
2
were
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
did
refer
to
the
facts
which
appear
in
the
state
department
record.
so
the
courts
were
considering
that
too.
and
i
don't
think
this
court
is
limited
to
determining
only
on
the
1951
election.
he
voted
in
three
national
elections.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
only
israeli
--
israeli
nation
--
mr.
charles
gordon
could
vote.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
he
did
vote.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
the
passport
file
of
the
department
of
state
was
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
was
considered
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
was
equally
before
the
court
and
it
is
lodged
in
the
files
of
the
clerk
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
the
court
below
--
i
think
they
found
that
on
the
basis
of
that
voting
alone,
they
lost
but
they
had
build
the
facts
and
i
think
this
court
will
consider.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
they
referred
to
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
--
i
agree
with
what
--
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
record
is
a
little
ambiguous.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
agree
with
your
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
true.
he
conceded
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
but
they
in
the
record
and
if
your
honor
will
look
at
pages
1
and
2,
you'll
see
that
the
record
shows
that
he
voted
in
two
other
elections,
1955
and
1959.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
complaint
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
i
don't
know
if
it
does
or
not.
he
hasn't
been
very
talkative
about
these
other
elections.
he
restricts
himself
to
the
first
election
but
he
does
not
deny
and
it
appears
in
the
record
that
he
did
vote
in
the
1955
and
1959
election.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
guess
he
has
been
so
talkative
in
some
state
department
but
in
this
proceeding,
he
has
restricted
--
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
sir.
there
is
testimony
before
the
state
department
board
of
review,
very
full
testimony.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
a
part
of
the
record
that
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
lodged
in
the
office
of
the
clerk,
yes.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
in
my
view,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
agreed
for,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
unfortunate
that
the
record
isn't
filled
up
but
these
materials
were
before
the
district
court.
they
were
part
of
the
record
considered
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
both
courts
have
that
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
the
transcript
of
state
department
file
which
is
certified
by
the
district
court
and
is
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don't
draw
such
a
distinction
but
i
want
to
cover
both
that
in
the
event
as
mr.
justice
clark
has
suggested
that
a
distinction
might
exist
in
the
minds
of
the
court.
i
think
it
covers
both
situations
where
he
was
not
a
citizen
and
voted
and
where
he
was
a
citizen
who
voted.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i'll
be
glad
to
describe
that
to
your
honor.
under
the
law
of
israel,
known
as
the
“law
of
return”,
all
jewish
persons
were
welcome
to
israel;
they
could
become
settlers.
that
law
was
passed
in
1950.
he
went
to
israel
a
month
after
that
law
became
effective.
in
1952,
israel
passed
its
nationality
law,
saying
that
all
jews
who
had
settled
in
israel
under
the
law
of
return
were
automatically
israeli's
citizens
but
they
have
a
right
to
elect
not
to
accept
israeli
citizenship
by
filing
a
written
election.
we
have
passport
which
was
submitted
by
the
petitioner
which
shows
that
israel
regarded
him
as
an
israeli
national,
issued
passport
to
him
and
therefore,
he
did
not
file
such
an
election.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
unfortunately,
this
--
mr.
charles
gordon
because
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
as
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
the
district
court.
as
the
parties
then
conceived
the
issue,
it
was
a
simple
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
based
on
a
single
act
to
voting.
but
i
think
that
in
adjudging
this
--
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
in
issue
of
this
importance
is
very
desirable
to
get
the
record
as
full
as
possible
and
i
think
that
if
the
record
were
as
full
as
it
can
be,
it
would
indicate
that
petitioner
has
demonstrated
his
diminution
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
has
indicated
that
he
regard
himself
as
a
citizen
of
israel.
indeed,
he
did
not
apply
for
an
american
passport
for
ten
years
and
did
apply
for
an
israel
passport
and
obtained
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
the
only
ground
that
is
involved
here
is
voting
in
the
election
of
israel.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
charles
gordon
by
being
naturalized
and
by
some
voluntarily
action
as
part.
that's
conceivable,
i
believe.
but
at
least,
insofar
as
voting
is
concerned,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
statute,
there
must
be
some
indication
of
the
diminished
allegiance
and
my
view
is
that
the
act
of
the
voting
in
itself,
indicates
such
a
diminution.
but
if
it
becomes
important
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
think
the
facts
here
if
fully
developed
would
demonstrate
that
the
allegiance
of
the
petitioner
here
is
primarily
to
israel
or
was
at
that
time
to
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
believe
that
would
if
that
is
considered
important.
in
our
view
of
the
case,
we
believe
the
statute
on
its
face
is
--
is
valid
and
we
would
support
the
statute
on
that
basis.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
wasn't
tried.
it
was
taken
by
the
court
on
stipulation;
united
states
attorney
in
new
york.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
there
is
an
officer
there
who
represents
the
immigration
service
in
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
mr.
charles
gordon
but,
your
honor,
the
--
there's
a
misconception
that
the
case
was
tried
only
on
the
stipulation
of
facts
because
with
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
government
incorporated
by
reference
the
passport
file
of
the
department
of
state
and
it
was
considered
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
your
honor
will
notice
the
opinions
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
contain
facts
which
nowhere
appear
in
the
stipulation.
i
myself
wondered
where
they
got
those
facts
until
i
found
out
that
the
passport
file
of
department
of
state
was
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
there's
no
such
admission.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
only
--
mr.
charles
gordon
but
the
record
includes
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
no.
but
it
cannot
be
ignored
that
this
is
an
official
israeli
identification
booklet
issued
to
the
petitioner.
there's
no
doubt
this
he
submitted.
and
in
it,
it
contains
indications,
notations
by
the
government
that
he
voted
in
the
other
two
elections.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
that
the
case
was
submitted
on
stipulation.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
i
--
i
don't
contend
that.
my
view
is
that
the
case
was
submitted
on
a
stipulation
and
on
the
certified
record
of
the
department
of
state,
which
was
incorporated
in
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
department
of
state
passport
file,
which
is
in
the
office
of
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
at
all.
no
reference
to
it
in
the
brief.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
my
own
view,
your
honor,
is
that
this
additional
material
is
not
relevant.
my
own
view
is
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
in
a
reasonable
determination
by
congress
that
there
is
potential
danger
to
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
if
the
person
--
united
states
citizen
votes
in
the
political
election
of
foreign
country
and
if
he
thereby
indicates
his
diminished
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
well
aware,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
gordon
i've
been
well
aware
to
that
situation,
your
honor,
that's
why
i
stressed
these
additional
facts
which
i
think
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
didn't
quite
say
that,
your
honor.
i
said
that
in
my
view,
i
don't
need
the
additional
record
but
i'm
aware
that
in
the
view
of
some
of
the
justices,
these
facts
may
be
important.
my
view
is
that
the
perez
case
is
still
the
law
that
this
court
is
not
modifying,
that
it
is
sound
and
that
on
the
basis
of
the
perez
case,
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election,
voluntary
voting
is
enough
to
cause
expatriation.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
two
israeli
passports
and
he
--
the
voluntary
becoming
a
citizen
of
israel
was
a
sort
of
a
nega
--
negative
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that's
right.
yes,
he
didn't
file
any
specific
declaration
saying,
“i
want
to
become
a
citizen”
but
he
didn't
take
advantage
of
the
other
opportunity
for
recollection.
i
may
say
that
in
the
state
department
--
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
i
have
it
here.
mr.
charles
gordon
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
certainly
so
that
this
is
not
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
previously.
i
discovered
this
in
my
researches.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
this
was
--
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
i
offer
my
apologies.
i
think
this
is
certainly
a
fault
on
our
part.
these
facts
were
discovered
by
me
in
my
research
in
preparing
for
the
case.
i
deemed
them
to
be
quite
important
as
the
members
of
the
court
do
in
the
disposition
of
this
case
and
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
this
case
were
decided
without
a
full
apprehension
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
these
facts
are
not
briefed.
these
--
the
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
the
--
part
of
them
are
on
my
brief.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
part
of
them
are
referred
to
the
brief.
the
fact
that
there
was
voting
in
the
two
additional
elections
is
referred
to
at
least
twice
in
the
brief.
mr.
charles
gordon
except
for
these
passports.
these
passports
weren't
submitted
by
petitioner
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
they
are
in
the
immigration
record.
they
were
never
before
the
court.
i
mentioned
them
only
because
petitioner
is
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
he
is
a
citizen
and
if
these
documents,
which
bear
i
think
on
his
citizenship
status
are
not
brought
before
the
court.
the
court
may
enter
a
judgment
declaring
him
to
be
a
citizen
when
he
actually
is
not.
i'm
sorry
the
argument
went
off
on
this
pageant
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
our
duty
to
bring
these
facts
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
well,
i
--
i
go
back
to
the
argument.
i
want
to
emphasize
the
possibility
that
in
this
case
and
unfortunately
some
of
these
facts
are
not
fully
developed
in
the
record.
all
of
them
are
in
the
record
except
for
this
passport.
the
indications
that
petitioner
intended
to
become
a
citizen
of
israel.
i
repeat,
in
1950,
he
went
to
israel.
he
lived
there
for
14
years.
he
did
not
apply
for
a
renewal
of
his
american
passport
which
expired
in
1950.
he
did
not
expired
--
applied
for
renewal
for
10
years.
he
did
not
register
with
the
american
embassy
or
consulate.
he
did
obtain
this
israeli
identification
booklet
in
1951.
in
1952,
after
the
new
nationality
law
became
effective,
he
did
obtain
an
israeli
passport.
he
voted
in
three
national
elections.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances,
of
course,
he
didn't
asked
to
retain
his
american
citizenship
when
the
new
israeli
nationality
law
went
into
effect.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances,
petitioner
has
indicated
that
his
primary
allegiance
is
to
israel
and
not
to
the
united
states.
now,
i
want
to
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
some
--
most
of
it
is
before
the
court,
in
my
view.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
it
was
a
part
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
motion.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
not
as
far
as
i'm
aware.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
i
--
i
wouldn't
say
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
that
the
facts
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
there
are
certain
facts
that
relate
to
his
status.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
mr.
justice
white,
this
is
not
uncommon
in
immigration
proceedings.
mr.
charles
gordon
some
of
the
facts
are
in
the
record,
your
honor.
this
is
the
israeli
identi
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
gordon
it's
a
booklet
of
his.
it's
a
--
an
identification
booklet
relating
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
it
is
--
this
is
his
booklet
which
he
submitted
to
us.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
the
only
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
no,
i
don't
agree,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
believe
the
district
court
passed
on
an
actual
case
because
it
is
conceded
that
petitioner
voted
in
the
election
of
1951.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
that
was
enough.
and
my
view
is,
also
that
that
is
enough
but
some
members
of
the
court
may
feel
that
the
additional
facts
which
i
have
suggested
are
relevant
to
the
consideration
of
this
case.
my
view
is,
that
on
the
stipulation
itself
is
concession
that
he
voted
voluntarily
in
a
political
election
in
israel
that
under
the
terms
of
statute
and
under
the
terms
of
perez
caused
him
to
lose
his
citizenship.
now
if
the
court
agrees
that
this
alone
is
sufficient,
then
the
case
is
over.
there's
no
need
to
consider
these
additional
facts.
if
the
court
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
when
these
facts
came
to
light
in
my
research,
this
was
the
time
i
was
preparing
for
argument.
they
were
not
fully
developed
in
the
courts
below.
the
records
were
before
the
court.
the
court
referred
to
some
of
these
facts.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
facts
--
some
of
the
facts
were
referred
to
in
the
opinions
of
the
court.
they
are
not
in
the
stipulation.
some
of
these
additional
facts.
and
i
was
mystified
as
i
said,
when
i
read
the
opinions
of
the
courts
of
where
they
got
these
facts
until
i
learned
that
the
court
had
the
benefit
of
the
certified
record
of
the
state
department.
this
booklet
incidentally
was
not
part
of
the
stipulation.
the
book,
of
which
is
on
pages
1
and
2.
that
was
in
the
state
department
record
and
was
extracted
from
that
record.
were
not
adding
anything
to
the
facts
which
are
considered
by
the
court
below.
the
fact
is,
that
these
--
the
certified
record
of
the
state
department
should
have
been
printed
because
it
was
considered
by
the
court
--
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
but
those
--
that
record
is
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
this
court
and
it
was
considered
by
the
court
below.
i'm
not
really
dragging
this
in
at
the
last
minute.
they
were
considered.
they
should
have
been
briefed
more
fully.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
the
posture
in
which
the
determination
to
affirm
might
be
entered
if
there
question
of
reversal
and
a
determination
that
statute
is
unconstitutional,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
additional
facts
may
be
relevant
in
the
consideration
of
a
majority
that
would
vote
that
way.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
that
differently.
in
my
view,
the
record
in
its
present
shape
is
sufficient
and
in
my
view,
the
record
in
its
present
shape
requires
an
affirmance
of
the
lower
courts.
in
my
view,
the
statute
as
it
was
upheld
in
perez
contemplates
that
the
mere
fact
of
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election,
voluntary
voting
as
is
conceded
here
causes
a
citizen
to
lose
his
nationality.
they
found
correct
in
that,
then
there's
nothing
further
in
the
case.
but
i
suggest
these
additional
facts
in
the
event
the
court
may
determine
their
relevance.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
--
i'm
also
satisfied
to
submit
it
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
exclude
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
definitely
is
the
only
issue
that
we
thought
we
are
bringing
to
this
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
if
your
honor
feels
that
my
duty
to
this
court
permits
me
to
exclude
these
facts,
that's
alright
but
i
thought
the
court
would
want
to
know
these
facts.
the
only
reason
i
brought
them
to
your
attention
is
that
they
may
be
significant
in
the
determination
of
this
issue.
and
they
were
before
the
district
courts.
the
courts
did
consider
them
and
refer
to
them.
mr.
charles
gordon
well
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
there
--
there
are
some
additional
circumstances.
the
court
mentioned
some
--
some
of
the
background
of
this
individual
to
which
i've
referred
in
the
opinions,
they
were
not
in
the
stipulation.
mr.
charles
gordon
because
that
--
that
was
the
only
issue
they
thought
was
significant.
that
alone,
they
said,
was
sufficient
to
uphold
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
perfectly
right,
your
honor,
but
the
district
court
found
that
one
fact
alone.
i
think
the
district
court
indicated
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
go
any
further;
that
this
fact
alone
was
sufficient
to
cause
loss
of
citizenship.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
if
those
facts
are
deemed
broad,
in
my
view,
they're
not
relevant.
in
the
view
of
the
government
at
that
time
they
entered
into
stipulation,
in
the
view
of
the
district
court,
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
those
additional
facts
are
not
relevant.
and
in
my
view,
if
the
court
agrees,
then
there's
nothing
further
to
the
case.
then
the
statute
is
constitutional
and
then
petitioner
lost
his
citizenship.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
think
we
can
leave
the
other
material
aside
if
the
court
agrees
with
me
in
that
position.
if
the
court
finds
that
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election
under
section
401
(e)
under
the
perez
case
itself
expatriate
him
then
there's
nothing
further
to
consider.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i'm
trying
to
be
a
little
predictive
as
to
what
might
be
relevant
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
justices.
and,
i'm
trying
to
bring
to
the
attention
really
the
facts
that
were
considered
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
well
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
trying
to
muddy
the
waters.
i
am
trying
to
give
the
entire
the
record
as
it
was
considered
by
the
district
court
and
only
part
of
it
appears
in
the
stipulation.
this
is
only
one
part
of
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
your
honor,
that
is
not
so.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
knew
about
it.
it
was
before
them.
no,
this
wasn't
hidden
from
anybody.
the
only
regret
i
have
is
that
they
weren't
printed
in
the
record
because
they
were
before
the
court
below.
this
is
not
something
i
dreamed
up.
it
was
considered
fully
in
the
court
below.
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
it
would
depend
on
the
context
and
on
the
understanding
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
--
i
agree
that
that's
a
possibility
but
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
--
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
fully
agree.
i
thought
if
i
did
not
bring
him
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
my
position
and
my
position
is
that
knowing
of
these
facts
and
knowing
that
they
may
be
relevant
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
justices,
it
was
my
obligation
to
bring
them
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
i'm
standing
on
the
statute.
i'm
standing
on
the
opinions
of
the
courts
below.
i
don't
believe,
in
my
view
of
the
statute
that
these
facts
are
relevant.
in
my
view
of
the
statute,
the
mere
fact
of
voting
is
sufficient
to
cause
expatriation.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
realized
that
there
are
some
possibilities
that
it
might
not
stand
and
i
therefore
feel
that
these
facts
may
be
significant
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
justices.
