mr.
ennis,
what
was
the
evil
that
congress
was
trying
to
prevent?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
was
the
basis,
wasn't
it?
the
main
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
it
appears
to
me
it
is
true,
it
real
permits,
non-residents,
non-foreigners
to
vote.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
did
not
have
to
be
a
nation
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
couldn't
have
any
effect
on
the
foreign
relations
with
israel.
justice
tom
c.
clark
does
mexico
require
their
voters
to
be
nationals
of
mexico?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
distinguish
the
fact
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
if
perez
represented,
he
was
a
mexican
which
he
did
at
that
time
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
while
your
petitioner
in
his
application
or
in
his
brochure
that
if
he
files
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
you
might
distinguish
between
them
rather
than
saying
that
you
were
obliged
to
overrule
perez.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
my,
my
--
i'm
suggesting
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
and
perhaps
said
that
i
would
vote
that
but
it
appears
to
me
that
it
has
to
be
voluntary
as
indicated
in
perez
by
--
if
one
who
said
“i'm
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
i
would
like
to
vote
in
your
election
and
they
said
okay,
i
--
certainly
it
would
not
be
a
voluntary
relinquishment
of
his
citizenship
to
the
united
states
insofar
as
your
expression
is
concerned
while
in
perez,
while
he
is
repetitiously
or
rather
he
represented
the
mexican
government
he
wasn't
(voice
overlap)
but
it
seems
to
be
a
volun
--
more
volunteer
there
would
be
in
the
other
case.

where
is
the

unless,
the

justice
tom
c.
clark
i
couldn't
--
justice
tom
c.

--
get
that,
then
before
us
of
that
stipulation
only
covers
one
election?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
he
didn't
have
a
chance
to
testify
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
fact,
to
me
though
when
you
say
that
the
case
was
submitted
on
stipulation
and
the
stipulation
only
includes
one
election
while
he
would
be
bound
by
that
stipulation.
