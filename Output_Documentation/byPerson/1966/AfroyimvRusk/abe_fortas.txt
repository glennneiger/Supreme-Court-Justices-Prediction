justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ennis,
how
often
does
this
problem
arise
as
practical
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
where
do
they
vote?
where
do
these
persons
voting?
justice
abe
fortas
they
don't
take
it
--
don't
take
your
time
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
--
mr.
gordon,
i
beg
your
pardon.
is
there
a
finding
that
he
intended
to
relinquish
his
citizenship?
justice
abe
fortas
but
his
voting
was
voluntary?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
government
contest
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
really
the
issue
that
we
have.
in
other
words,
the
government
says
that
it's
immaterial
whether
he
intended
to
or
not
and
he
says
that
it
is
material.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
--
what
do
you
mean
there
was
a
reference
to
those
things
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below?
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
really
--
really
there
ought
to
be
--
ought
to
be
lot
of
ambiguity
about
what
is
and
what's
not
part
of
the
record
should
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
one
of
the
government
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
too
bad.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
he
had
been
very
talkative?
justice
abe
fortas
was
he
--
was
--
is
there
any
oral
testimony
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
part
of
the
record
of
the
record
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
so
this
is
not
a
case
it's
here
on
the
stipulated
facts?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'd
like
to
here
your
brother
ennis
as
toward
his
understanding
as
in
the
record
because
i
think
it's
kind
of
important
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
show
where
--
is
there
anything
in
the
stipulation
where
can
we
look
at?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
it's
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
but
i
say,
what
is
there
in
the
papers
that
had
been
submitted
to
us
has
any
reference
to
it
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
is
the
first
time
these
facts
have
been
called
of
this
court's
attention?
justice
abe
fortas
what?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
new
member
of
this
court
and
i
wasn't
here
at
the
time
of
perez.
i
had
ordered
considerable
time
to
your
papers.
now,
what
you're
telling
me
that
there
are
facts
and
circumstances
here
that
you
contend
a
part
of
the
record
before
us
and
which
had
not
been
called
our
attention?
justice
abe
fortas
fortunately,
you
see
i
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
your
oral
document
before
today.
that
usually
happens.
that
we
hear
oral
argument
only
when
it's
made
to
us
so
i
didn't
--
these
facts
were
not
called
tp
our
attention.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
court
on
this?
justice
abe
fortas
you've
gone
way
beyond
any
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court,
haven't
you?
what
you're
really
telling
us
is
that
the
district
court
passed
upon
a
hypothetical
case
and
that
what's
before
us
now
is
really
a
hypothetical
case.
that's
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
if
you
confine
yourself
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court
about
two-thirds
of
what
you've
been
telling
us
would
have
to
be
eliminated
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
from
the
factual
terms,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
really
--
i
really
don't
want
to
be
overly
critical
but
what
it
sounds
--
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
what
you're
telling
us
and
you've
got
before
us
two
records.
one
record,
if
we
are
willing
to
affirm
but
quite
another
in
a
much
more
extensive
record,
if
we
are
so
misguided
in
your
point
of
view
is
to
reverse.
now,
that's
kind
of
a
novel
concept
as
first
concerned
but
may
be
i'm
just
not
adequately
informed
as
to
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gordon,
isn't
it
a
fact
that
when
stipulation
of
fact
is
presented
to
a
court
and
the
court
rather
amounts
to
a
request
to
the
court
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
these
are
the
facts
in
stipulation.
if
they
were
preliminary
motions,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
motion
to
dismiss
to
which
affidavit
were
attached
or
as
you
get
here,
you
attach
record.
and
thereafter,
a
stipulation
of
fact
is
presented
to
the
court
by
the
parties.
isn't
it
customary
for
the
court
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
stipulation
of
facts
without
reference
to
the
affidavits
or
whatever
may
be
attached
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment?
is
that
the
way
we
run
law
business?
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
parties
in
the
--
in
the
stipulation
of
fact,
went
to
the
court
also
to
consider
the
affidavits
or
a
transcript
that
was
involved
in
some
of
the
preliminary
motions,
there
would
be
a
reference
to
that.
that
would
be
incorporated
in
the
stipulation
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
and
now
you're
here
telling
us
--
you're
here
talking
to
us
about
this
case
in
which
those
stipulation
of
facts
and
you're
also
using
a
phrase
that
was
“before
the
court”,
some
other
documents
that
were
involved
in
the
preliminary
motions.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
what
lawyers
do
before
trial
courts
and
then
appellate
courts,
case
that's
involved
that's
decided
on
the
basis
of
stipulation
of
fact
is
to
assume
that
the
court
attended
to
the
material
included
in
the
stipulation
of
fact.
and
this
is
some
other
reference,
some
other
provisions
as
something
else
is
said
here
and
you
might
have
put
there
might
be
a
nature
in
the
file
with
the
clerk.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
was
before
the
court
in
the
sense
of
being
a
part
of
a
factual
record
to
which
the
court
devoted
its
attention
in
deciding
the
case.
