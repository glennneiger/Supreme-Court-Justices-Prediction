justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
no
--
you
--
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
there's
just
no
behavior
by
the
citizen
which
may
--
which
congress
may
recognize
as
a
--
in
effect
in
expatriation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
congress
can
say
that
that
there's
some
--
there's
some
events
which
will
result
in
involuntary
expatriation.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
thing
as
israel
nationality.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
but
in
the
second
two
elections
in
which
it
shown
that
he
voted,
there
was
israel
nation
--
such
a
thing
as
israel
nationality.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
only
israelis
could
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
could
vote,
is
that
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
it's
an
--
may
be
important
to
know
on
--
what
basis
this
case
was
decided.
i'd
understood
that
it's
decided
on
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
indicates
that
which
is
--
which
includes
only
the
first
of
those
three
votes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
--
did
you
draw
the
thing
--
a
large
distinction
between
the
two
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
in
the
last
two
elections
in
which
he
voted,
it
is
necessary
to
be
a
national
of
israel
on
both
the
elections.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
he
evidence
that
he
was
national
of
israel?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
is
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
it
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
wanted
--
you
wanted
to
get
the
issue
up
here
on
the
--
on
that
they're
voting
issue
in
this
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
shouldn't
we
take
the
case
like
that
instead
of
this
other
evidence
which
apparently
you
didn't
--
the
government
could
have
put
in
the
evidence
if
they
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
could,
on
that
evidence
so
that
the
court
can
hold
on
this
current
statute
unconstitutional
and
still
--
and
still
say
that
he'd
lost
his
citizenship
on
another
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
i
mean,
that's
--
that
--
that
--
that
but
this
other
evidence
in
the
record,
you
might
sustain
lost
citizenship
even
though
you
did
it
on
the
basis
of
voting.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
do
it
on
the
basis
of
becoming
--
becoming
a
citizen
of
another
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
veracity
in
the
motion
--
for
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
do
you
suppose
just
an
incorporation
by
reference
gives
these
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
care
whether
it
was
before
the
court
or
not
but
what
is
this
--
what
is
this
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on?
based
on
some
uncontroverted
facts,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
everything
--
every
single
word
in
that
file,
you
expect
the
other
side
will
accept
without
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
care
about
the
relevancy.
how
about
the
truth?
you
say
that
every
fact
in
that
file
has
been
accepted
by
the
court
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
which
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
one
that
you
want?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
government
wanted
to
declare
him
with
a
summary
judgment
and
attach
some
affidavits
and
give
the
other
side
the
opportunity
to
controvert
them
that
might
have
been
one
thing.
but
here
is
a
blanket
of
reference
to
a
file.
it
might
have
all
sorts
of
things
and
even
contradictory
material.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
care
whether
it's
common
or
uncommon.
i
just
want
to
know
about
that
--
about
what
facts
you
expect
the
court
to
operate
on
when
you
--
all
you
do
is
make
a
broad
reference
to
--
to
some
file.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
really
know
that
for
example,
he
voted
in
the
last
--
in
the
last
two
elections?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
that
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
know
courts
considered
it,
all
you
know
that
it
is
part
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
neither
in
the
court
below
mentioned
any
voting
except
the
voting
in
one
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
they
have
--
neither
court
--
certainly
the
district
court
never
found
any
fact
with
respect
to
these
other
two
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
how
we're
going
to
sit
up
here
and
say
that
even
if
we
wanted
to,
how
--
how
we
could
say
that
what
facts
were.
we
don't
know
whether
they're
facts
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
no
--
you
--
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
there's
just
no
behavior
by
the
citizen
which
may
--
which
congress
may
recognize
as
a
--
in
effect
in

--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
congress
can
say
that
that
there's
some
--
there's
some
events
which
will
result
in
involuntary
expatriation.
justice
byron
r.

justice

how
did
he
evidence
that
he
was

of
israel?
justice
byron

white
and
why
is
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
it
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
wanted

you
wanted
to

on

on
that

this
