justice
john
m.
harlan
wouldn't
the
--
what
you're
asking
is
to
overrule
perez?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
interrupt
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
agree
that
the
--
taking
those
two
propositions
that
the
constitutional
question
is
this,
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
reasonably
or
rationally
so
conclude
irrespective
of
what
we
or
some
others
might
think
as
the
wisdom
of
the
legislation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
provision
of
the
constitution
which
do
you
derive
that
annotation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
you
didn't
have
the
fourteenth
amendment,
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
did
you
derive
this
connotation
as
congressional
power
and
that's
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
have
to
overrule
the
decision
of
this
court
in
perez
to
the
statutes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
among
others,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
that
there'd
been
a
full
congressional
evidentiary
record
made
that
voting
in
foreign
elections
had
indication
embarrassing
to
the
foreign
relation
to
the
united
states
and
congress
had
asked
--
had
acted
on
that
kind
of
a
record.
what
would
be
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
you
can
establish
that
proposition,
you
don't
have
to
argue
anything
else.
justice
john
m.
harlan
will
you
regard
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
imposing
enunciation
of
congressional
power
of
your
own
statement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
it
be
in
evidence
by
a
fourteenth
amendment
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
tried
these
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
united
states
attorney
represented
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
your
view
of
that
in
your
submission
which
practically
would
support
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
i
would
suppose
that
you
would
be
trying
to
defend
the
states
as
well
on
some
kind
of
the
basis
of
case
that
you'd
make
it
appropriate
to
this
court
and
not
to
have
to
base
the
case
at
least
the
decision
to
this
court
or
do
that
much
substantive
if
they're
not
--
if
they
can
be
avoided
in
overruling
in
some
other
perhaps
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
substantive
means
if
you
now
say,
you
won't
have
to
worry
about
what
the
additional
record
is
saying,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
a
brief
on
these
facts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
i
understand
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
just
said
that's
not
in
your
brief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
materials
themselves
do
rely
on
your
print
of
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
wasn't
a
premise
on
the
statement
of
about
stating
perez
in
these
facts.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
didn't
have
to
use
that
position,
they
shall
be
deliberately
defined
whether
there
is
sufficient
inquiry
to
include
(inaudible)
or
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
posture
in
which
this
case
exactly,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
what
you
are
doing.
you
are
quite
contented
on
the
stipulation
of
this
court
from
the
secret
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
understand
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps,
we
have
one
common
ground
in
that
(inaudible).
