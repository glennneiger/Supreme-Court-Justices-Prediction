mr.
edward
j.
ennis
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit,
which
unanimously
affirmed
a
summary
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
holding
that
the
petitioner
had
expatriated
himself
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
401
(e)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940
by
the
act
of
voting
in
an
election
in
the
state
of
israel
in
1951
for
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
israel.
this
case
was
to
be
argued
by
the
general
counsel
for
the
new
york
civil
liberties
union
nanette
dembitz-berman,
who
wrote
the
briefs
in
the
case
and
it
is
mrs.
berman's
appointment
as
a
judge
of
the
family
court
of
the
city
of
new
york
that
brings
me
here
today.
she
is
very
disappointed
that
she
missed
this
opportunity
to
address
the
court
on
this
subject.
the
facts
are
very
simple
and
are
stated
in
a
stipulation
of
facts
which
appears
in
the
record
and
--
at
page
11
and
are
simply
that
the
petitioner
who
was
born
in
poland
in
1893,
immigrated
to
the
united
states
in
1912,
was
naturalized
in
1926
and
went
to
israel
in
1949,
a
year
after
that
state
was
established
in
1948.
and
in
1951,
he
voted
for
the
second
knesset,
which
was
the
second
election
of
the
legislature
of
israel.
at
that
time
indeed,
when
there
was
no
israeli
citizenship
at
all
and
that
everyone
who
voted
in
that
election,
voted
on
the
basis
of
their
residence
in
israel.
indeed,
it
was
that
legislature
which
a
year
later
adopted
the
first
israeli
law
of
nationality
and
established
israeli
nationality.
the
district
court,
in
the
basis
of
the
stipulation
of
facts
in
which
it
appeared
that
the
petitioner
voluntarily
voted
in
that
political
election,
stated
that
it
was
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
perez
case
in
1958
and
held
that
he
had
lost
his
citizenship
as
indeed
when
he
applied
for
a
united
states
passport
in
1960
to
return
to
the
united
states,
the
consul
in
israel
so
determined
and
the
state
department
approved
that
loss
of
citizenship
and
when
he
did
return,
he
obtained
a
full
hearing,
which
is
part
of
the
record,
before
the
passport
review
board
which
affirmed
this
loss
of
nationality
and
then
he
brought
this
--
this
action.
the
record
does
indicate
that
the
man's
profession,
he
was
an
artist
by
profession,
a
painter
and
sculptor,
and
indeed
in
this
country,
he
has
some
of
his
paintings
which
are
products
of
the
wpa
art
program
in
some
of
our
high
schools
and
hospitals.
the
case
presents
squarely
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
401
(e)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
which
is
repeated
in
haec
verba
in
sections
349
of
the
present
immigration
and
nationality
act.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
over
--
yes,
overruled
perez,
which
is
now.
mr.
justice
harlan,
when
i
--
i
recognize
the
--
from
the
facts
of
the
reargument
that
was
ordered
in
perez,
the
100
pages
of
opinions
on
that
--
in
that
case
and
the
trop
case,
the
75
of
pages
of
opinion
in
the
mendoza
case
which
followed
a
year
--
few
years
later,
in
which
again
the
court
ordered
rearguments.
when
i
read
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
those
cases
and
read
the
records
in
the
briefs,
i
must
say
i
was
nonplussed
as
to
what
i've
read
to
the
consideration
of
the
court
of
this
--
again
of
this
issue,
which
has
been
obviously
so
painstakingly
considered
by
the
court.
in
the
short
time
that
is
available
to
me,
i
felt
it
would
be
bootless
and
of
no
assistance
to
the
court
to
try
to
review
here
the
formulations
of
the
applicable
constitutional
doctrine.
most
of
the
justices
are
sitting
here
have
expressed
themselves
on
the
constitutional
doctrine.
it
occurred
to
me
that
in
my
short
time,
i
might
assist
the
court
by
examining
very
briefly
the
two
factual
propositions
which
are,
i
submit,
accepted
by
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
present
case
and
which
i
believe
are
factually
false.
one
of
those
propositions
in
which
the
solicitor
general
bases
his
argument,
one
of
those
propositions
is
that
for
an
american
citizen
to
vote
in
a
foreign
election
is
an
indication
of
some
diminution
of
his
allegiance
to
the
united
states
and
some
adherence
to
a
foreign
allegiance.
the
other
proposition
is
that
for
an
american
citizen
to
so
vote
in
a
foreign
election,
in
some
way
embroils
the
united
states
in
foreign
affairs
or
in
some
way
exacerbates
or
makes
more
difficult
the
handling
of
foreign
affairs.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
very
briefly
that
both
of
those
propositions
are
factually
inaccurate.
now,
as
to
the
first
proposition,
that
voting
in
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
certainly.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
agree
--
subject
to
my
basic
constitutional
position
that
where
we're
dealing
with
citizenship
granted
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
congress
has
much
less
authority
and
indeed,
my
final
proposition
is
that
congress
has
no
authority,
under
the
constitution
to
remove
united
states
citizenship
that
this
can
only
be
done
by
the
voluntary
act
of
the
united
states
citizen
and
all
that
the
power
of
congress
is,
is
to
regulate
the
manner
in
which
this
voluntary
expatriation
shall
be
expressed.
obviously,
a
man
cannot
put
a
note
of
expatriation
on
his
desk
floor
and
take
it
out
when
he
wants
to.
congress
can
say
that
if
you
wish
to
adjure
allegiance
to
the
united
states,
if
you're
abroad,
you
must
do
it
before
a
consul.
if
you
are
in
the
united
states,
you
must
do
it
on
the
forms
supplied
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
the
limit
of
congress'
power
is
to
regulate
voluntary
conduct
or
conduct
which
in
most
instances
or
in
common
experience
is
voluntary.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
provides
that
every
person
born
in
the
united
states
or
naturalized
alien
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
in
which
he
resides.
and
from
the
opinions
expressed
by
some
of
the
justices
that
this
sets
up
a
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
its
citizens,
which
the
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
terminate,
that
the
relationship
of
citizenship
can
only
be
terminated
by
the
act
of
the
individual
and
that
congress
is
therefore
limited
to
regulating
those
voluntary
acts.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
none
at
all.
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
it's
plain
that
a
naturalization
in
the
foreign
state
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
the
clearest
indication
of
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
my
--
my
--
my
personally
belief
that
congress
may
take
conduct
which
normally
connotes
a
putting
off
of
your
united
states
allegiance
and
taking
on
a
foreign
allegiance
and
may
nominate
that
may
--
as
a
control
of
voluntary
conduct
may
say
that
that
is
expatriation.
even
though
the
individual
says
that,
“i
denied
what
i'm
doing,”
has
a
natural
effect
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
i
--
well
--
we're
standing
on
a
very
narrow
ground,
your
honor,
of
whether
conduct
which
in
common
experience
is
considered
voluntary,
whether
the
particular
individual
who
was
acting
voluntarily
and
becoming
as
i
said
that
i
don't
want
this
to
have
the
result
which
the
law
says
it
shall
have.
now,
i
say
that
that's
voluntary
conduct
and
all
that
the
congress
is
doing
and
all
that
it
can
do
constitutionally
is
recognized
this
effect
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
what
i
--
that's
what
i
want
to
come
to.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
but
the
trouble
with
that
is,
your
honor,
is
that
voting
as
a
factual
matter
does
not
indicate
a
maybe
voluntary
conduct
but
it's
not
voluntary
conduct
that
indicates
a
lack
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
or
the
adherence
to
a
foreign
state.
now,
let
me
very
briefly
just
state
one
page
of
history
on
this
matter.
this
came
into
the
law
in
1940.
our
courts,
from
the
founding
of
the
republic
until
1868,
in
many
opinions
of
this
court
and
other
courts,
had
considered
the
whole
problem
of
expatriation
and
indeed
a
very
strong
opinion
was
held
that
the
common
law
applied
and
that
allegiance
was
permanent
and
there
could
be
no
expatriation.
this
was
debated
in
the
courts.
there
were
cases
on
voting
for
example.
there
were
three
cases,
a
federal
case,
a
main
case,
and
iowa
case
in
which
the
individuals
had
voted
in
canadian
elections.
the
courts
unanimously
held
that
voting
was
not
an
indication
of
loss
of
united
states
allegiance.
these
cases
are
quoted
in
borchard's
diplomatic
protection
abroad
and
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
would
my
argument
be
the
same
without
the
fourteenth
amendment?
yes,
i
would
--
my
argument
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
would
derive
it
upon
the
nature
of
the
relation
to
count
--
the
relationship
between
the
government
and
its
citizens
under
our
constitution.
i
would
say
that
the
one
thing
that
congress
in
achieving
its
statutory
objectives
that
one
sanction
that
is
not
available
to
it
unless
the
constitution
gave
to
it
expressly
was
the
termination
of
citizenship,
the
termination
of
the
relation
between
the
state
and
one
of
its
--
one
of
its
members.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
are
you
--
is
your
honor
referring
to
mackenzie
in
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
your
honor,
the
opinions
of
the
court
have
discussed
mackenzie
as
a
suspension
of
citizenship
during
coverture
because
of
the
special
relationship
of
the
wife
as
part
of
the
husband.
i
think
that
deals
with
that
case
so
far
as
savorgnan
case
is
concerned
that
this
is
the
case
that
really
i
was
discussing
with
mr.
justice
white
where
a
woman
becomes
naturalized
in
the
foreign
state.
and
although
she
signed
the
papers
and
becomes
naturalized
and
abjures
allegiance
to
the
united
states,
she
said
“i
did
it
because
my
husband,
the
united
states
--
the
italian
consul
in
st.
louis
asked
me
to
do
it.
i
really
don't
want
to
lose
my
citizenship.”
i
am
content
to
take
the
position
that
conduct,
which
is
considered
normally
as
voluntary
conduct
that
merely
by
--
say
so,
the
individual
may
not
say
that
it
doesn't
have
the
result
that
law
said
it
does.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
an
examination
of
this
history
indicates
that
there
was
no
evil
that
congress
was
trying
to
prevent.
let
me
try
or
range
you
directly,
mr.
justice
clark
this
way.
and
on
the
second
factual
proposition
that
our
foreign
relations
might
be
affected,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
that
voting
in
foreign
elections,
there's
not
the
slightest
indication
that
voting
in
a
foreign
election
had
in
a
--
legally,
at
the
invitation
of
the
foreign
government
in
effect,
has
any
effect
on
our
foreign
relations.
let's
examine
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
this
was
--
this
was
recited
your
honor,
in
one
short
statement
which
i
will
refer
to.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
voting
at
that
time,
your
honor,
was
based
entirely
on
residence.
there
was
no
israeli
nationality.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
you
did
not
have
to
be
--
no,
you
did
not
have
to
be
foreign
national.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
but
let
me
tell
--
let
me
suggest
two
other
instances
your
honor,
which
perhaps
point
out
your
question.
this
1940
law
is
on
the
books
for
only
one
reason.
the
chairman
of
the
immigration
of
the
judiciary
committee,
immigration
subcommittee,
mr.
dickstein
of
new
york,
was
exercised
by
the
fact
that
german
aliens,
resident
aliens
and
naturalized
germans
went
back
to
the
czar
in
1935
and
voted
that
the
czar
should
be
german
rather
than
french.
this
didn't
bother
the
french
government.
it
didn't
bother
the
german
government,
it
didn't
bother
the
state
department
but
it
certainly
bothered
mr.
dickstein
and
he
proposed
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
he
set
up
a
commission
to
examine
the
nationality
laws
and
to
codify
it.
in
the
course
of
that
codification,
a
new
section
which
we're
dealing
with
crept
into
the
codification
which
the
--
which
was
transmitted
to
the
president
for
the
very
modest
letter
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
attorney
general
to
the
effect
that
these
are
only
suggestions
for
the
consideration
of
congress.
one
of
these
suggestions
was
voting
in
a
political
election
in
a
foreign
state
or
participating
in
an
election
of
plebiscite
to
determine
the
sovereignty
of
a
foreign
territory.
the
entire
support
for
that
proposal
is
in
two
short
paragraphs.
in
the
rest
of
this
report,
the
other
proposals
are
supported
by
judicial
decisions,
by
diplomatic
decisions,
the
correspondence
between
the
secretary
of
state
and
foreign
governments.
this
course
which
we're
dealing
with
has
two
sentences
in
it.
along
the
line,
your
honor,
suggested
without
any
factual
support
whatever
and
here's
what
they
are.
this
section
is
clear,
applicable
on
any
case
on
american
votes
in
a
political
election
in
a
foreign
state
whether
or
not
he's
a
national
thereof.
taking
an
active
part
in
the
political
affairs
of
a
foreign
state
by
voting
in
a
political
election
therein
is
believed
to
involve
a
political
attachment
and
practical
allegiance
thereto,
which
is
in
consistent
with
continued
allegiance
to
the
united
states
whether
or
not
the
person
in
question
has
acquired
the
nationality
of
the
foreign
state.
there
was
not
one
iota
of
factual
support
for
the
statement
prepared
by
the
state
department,
i
think
by
the
assistant
solicitor,
mr.
flournoy,
who
was
the
state
department
expert
for
many
years
on
nationality
questions.
at
the
suggestion
of
the
--
mr.
dickstein,
the
chairman
of
the
house
immigration
committee,
there
is
--
not
only
no
support
for
that
statement
but
the
factual
evidence
in
the
diplomatic
history
of
the
united
states
was
at
that
time
that
voting
in
a
foreign
election
was
not
an
indication
of
throwing
offered
or
any
diminution
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
for
taking
on
allegiance
to
a
foreign
state.
as
i've
indicated
to
the
court,
the
judicial
decisions
which
are
the
contrary,
the
diplomatic
correspondence
which
discussed
that
great
length
how
you
could
lose
united
states
nationality
was
limited
entirely
to
naturalization
abroad,
and
residing
abroad
as
part
of
that
naturalization,
or
adjuring
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
there
was
no
support
whatever
for
that
statement.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
when
mr.
perez
was
born
in
el
paso,
voted
in
a
mexican
election
for
president,
i
do
not
know,
your
honor,
whether
the
mexican
law
required
him
to
be
a
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
let
me
give
you
one,
a
bit
of
factual
information.
the
first
page
of
the
record
contains
mr.
afroyim's
identification
booklet
which
he
had
a
hand
in
when
he
voted.
that
lists
him
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
i
mean
there
wasn't
any
question
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
only
of
the
united
states
and
that
he
disclosed
this
and
voted
as
a
citizen.
now,
if
your
honor's
suggestion
is
that
this
case
might
be
distinguished
on
this
basis
from
the
matter
of
a
person
who
was
a
citizen
of
the
foreign
state,
all
i
can
say
that
the
statute
as
drawn
will
not
support
such
a
distinction
and
indeed,
my
last
argument
and
the
one
that
appeal
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
in
the
--
in
the
perez
case,
was
that
in
any
event
the
statute
that's
drawn
was
too
broad
because
it
covered
a
person,
an
american
citizen
who
voted
in
the
foreign
election
whether
or
not
the
circumstances
indicated
any
diminution
of
u.s.
allegiance
or
any
taking
on
of
a
foreign
allegiance.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
of
course,
i
understand
that.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well
except,
your
honor,
might
--
perceive,
of
course,
the
distinction
your
honor's
suggesting
that
i
do
not
stand
on
it.
this
law
has
been
held
to
take
away
the
united
states
citizenship
even
if
you
vote
in
a
municipal
election
as
to
whether
it
should
be
local
option
that
forbear
control
or
not.
this
law
has
been
--
by
the
people
administering
it
by
the
lower
trib
--
administrative
tribunals,
they
say
any
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election
or
in
a
plebiscite
takes
away
your
united
states
citizenship
and
i
do
not
think
that
your
honor's
distinction
will
support
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
because
i
do
not
believe
that
a
dual
citizen,
the
voting
in
a
foreign
election
and
exercising
his
rights
under
his
second
citizenship
indicates
any
desire
to
terminate
his
united
states
citizenship.
i
do
not
think
that
factual
supports
there.
at
any
rate,
it
is
curious
that
the
instance
which
brought
this
law
into
being
in
this
all
instance,
as
i
say
without
any
diplomatic
or
factual
or
judicial
support
was
this
voting
in
the
czar
which
disturbed
me
that
our
government
nor
the
other
two
governments
involved,
the
german
or
the
french
government.
but
it's
suggested
in
this
one
paragraph,
which
is
all
that
this
court
relied
on
in
perez.
in
any
event,
it
is
not
believed
that
an
american
national
should
be
permitted
to
participate
in
the
politics,
in
the
political
affairs
of
a
foreign
state
and
at
the
same
time
retain
his
american
nationality.
the
two
facts
would
seem
to
be
inconsistent
with
each
other.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
in
view
of
the
complete
lack
of
any
authority
for
that
statement,
it
is
purposely
extremely
tentative
in
its
own
terms.
it's
a
suggestion
and
curiously
enough,
congress
took
this
tentative
suggestion
and
passed
it
without
any
debate
at
all
and
put
this
into
the
nationality
act,
which
was
generally
a
codification
of
the
former
laws
and
edit
this
provision
without
any
debate
on
it.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
my
position
would
not
change
for
the
reason
that
i
do
not
believe
that
this
extremely
limited
power
of
congress
to
regulate
voluntary
expatriation
permits
congress
to
achieve
a
purpose
of
the
exercise
of
it
power's
namely
the
promotion
of
good
foreign
relations.
it
doesn't
put
in
congress'
hands
the
weapons
of
expatriation.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
that
is
a
--
that
is
perhaps
a
more
difficult
proposition
than
the
--
than
what
the
factual
proposition
is,
that
foreign
relations
are
not
exacerbated
by
voting
in
a
foreign
election
which
is
usually
at
the
invitation
of
the
foreign
government.
and
if
your
honor
will
read
again
the
majority
in
perez,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
for
the
court,
has
one
citation
and
for
the
proposition
that
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
might
be
affected
by
voting.
he
cites
one
article
in
the
american
journal
of
international
law,
mr.
bruce's
article
which
deals
entirely
with
the
question
of
private
persons
by
propaganda
in
our
soil
or
in
the
soil
of
one
nation
attacking
a
foreign
government
and
mr.
bruce
concludes
his
article
by
saying,
this
is
the
kind
of
private
conduct
which
cannot
be
controlled
in
our
country.
this
is
only
citations
of
the
court
for
the
proposition
that
congress
might
reasonably
think
that
voting
in
a
foreign
election
injured
our
foreign
relations
and
was
a
sufficient
basis
for
what
mr.
justice
brennan
has
called
the
“drastic
and
truly
terrible
remedy
of
expatriation”.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
your
honor,
we
have
put
in
our
supplemental
brief
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
the
number
of
persons
who
have
lost
their
citizenship
by
voting
in
foreign
elections
in
just
the
last
few
years
and
it
runs
to
a
couple
of
thousand
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
unfortunately,
i
don't
have
the
--
ms.
dembitz
has
put
them
in
this
memorandum
and
she
obtained
these
facts
from
the
state
department
and
the
fact
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes
but
we
--
we
don't
--
i
don't
find
here,
your
honor,
the
particular
elections
that
were
involved
or
the
particular
statement
involved.
now,
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
i
have
wanted
to
refer,
your
honor,
to
this
factual
basis
because
frankly,
it
was
the
only
thing
in
reading
the
opinions
of
the
court
and
in
reading
all
of
the
briefs,
it
was
the
only
thing
that
i
had
--
that
i
thought
i
found
that
have
not
been
completely
explored
in
the
opinions
of
the
court
that
namely,
that
this
proposition
that
voting
in
the
foreign
election
did
indicate
some
diminution
of
allegiance
or
taking
on
a
foreign
list
was
just
erroneous
and
also
other
factual
proposition
that
our
foreign
relations
are
affected.
now,
let
me
give
you
other
example
and
i
will
sit
down.
in
addition
to
this
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
of
course
not,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
establish
any
such
thing.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
correct.
now,
i
sit
down
with
calling
your
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
of
course,
your
honor.
i'll
sit
down
by
calling
your
honor's
attention
to
one
other
factual
matter.
congress
has
recognized
that
voting
in
a
foreign
election
in
effect
does
not
diminish
your
relation
--
your
allegiance
to
the
united
states
by
providing
--
by
having
to
amend
the
act;
to
provide
that
every
american
citizen
who
voted
in
italy
between
1946
and
1948
should
be
given
their
citizenship
back
because
it
was
recognized
that
often
voting
of
foreign
relation,
contrary
to
being
against
the
united
states
citizenship
may
be
done
at
the
instance
of
officials
of
the
united
states,
asking
for
support
of
a
foreign
government
by
american
citizens
residing
in
that
territory
who
are
eligible
to
vote.
so
that
the
american
citizens,
thousands
of
them,
who
voted
the
italian
elections
after
the
war
from
1946
to
1948
had
been
given
back
their
citizenship
by
congress,
recognizing,
i
submit,
in
effect
that
such
voting
is
not
a
voluntary
giving
off
up
your
citizenship.
if
i
have
--
i
think
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
no
further
argument
but
i've
been
a
member
of
this
court
for
30
years
and
i
would
not
submit
and
request
this
court
to
rule
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
and
improper
record.
what's
been
said
here
about
passport
is
entirely
out
of
order
and
in
two
minutes,
i
can
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
court
that
you
have
a
proper
record
and
a
proper
issue.
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
your
honor,
under
the
nationality
act
and
the
laws
of
nationality,
there
are
some
15
grounds.
now
the
way
it's
determined
whether
a
person
has
lost
it's
nationality.
he
goes
through
a
passport.
he
goes
to
the
consul.
this
printed
form,
your
honor,
certificate
of
laws
and
nationality,
he
gives
an
affidavit.
it's
made
out.
here's
the
certificate
that
he
lost
his
nationality
by
voting
in
an
election
on
july
30
of
1951
not
that
he
used
the
passport
there
who
was
naturalized
in
some
other
country.
that's
a
precise
issue.
and
the
certificate
of
nationality
was
issued.
now,
what
is
this
business
on
the
record?
when
he
got
to
the
united
states,
now
i
learned
from
my
friend
here
that
he
got
here
on
israeli
passport.
well,
may
be
that's
the
only
he
could
get
here
when
in
1960,
the
united
states
consul
said
he'd
lost
his
citizenship
and
that
he
--
and
he
came
here
to
bring
the
suit
to
get
it
back.
now,
what
happens?
when
the
consul
issues
this
certificate
of
nationality,
you
have
under
the
state
department
regulations
an
appeal
to
the
passport
review
board.
this
is
a
transcript
of
the
record,
100
pages
in
which
to
mr.
afroyim
himself
without
counsel
went
before
these
three
members
of
the
board
and
there
were
president
in
addition
to
the
three
members:
the
chief
of
the
foreign
operations
division
and
specialist
on
israeli
affairs.
now,
they
talked
to
mr.
afroyim
for
a
100
pages
and
they
talked
on
one
issue.
did
you
lose
your
nationality
when
you
voted
in
the
one
election
in
1951?
now,
in
the
basis
of
the
record
and
their
affirmance
of
the
consul's
action,
he
brought
an
action
in
the
district
court
and
his
attorney,
and
he
insist
the
united
states
attorney
assisted
by
the
attorney
for
the
district
court
as
well
the
immigration
service,
do
stipulation
of
the
facts.
now
on
page
11
it
says
that,
“on
november
14,
1960,
the
american
consul
in
haiti
ruled
he
had
lost
his
--
that
he
had
expatriated
himself
on
july
30
of
1951
by
voting
in
a
political
election
in
a
foreign
state.
that's
all
that
was
in
the
case.
it
was
whether
that
vote
lost
his
nationality.
now,
in
addition
to
the
stipulation,
the
government
brought
in
at
the
hearing
before
the
district
judge
the
administrative
file
offered
in
evidence.
it's
limited
to
the
1950
--
to
the
--
1951
issue.
we
made
no
objection,
his
attorney
at
that
time.
and
this
is
part
of
the
record
and
it's
in
this
court.
but
still,
the
issue
is
only
one
simple
thing.
did
you
lose
your
citizenship
by
voting
in
1951?
now,
my
friend,
mr.
gordon
called
me
and
he
said,
“i
found
out
that
your
client
had
a
passport,
an
israeli
passport.”
i
said,
“charles”,
i
said
this,
“i
don't
--
i
didn't
know
that.”
i
said,
“this
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.”
the
nationality
act
does
not
make
having
a
foreign
passport.
it
was
in
--
by
the
way,
it
was
in
described
to
the
'40
act.
it
was
stricken
out
by
congress
using
a
foreign
passport.
i
said,
“charles,
it's
not
in
the
record.
the
record
is
limited
--
i'm
perfectly
happy.
i
have
the
record
included
this
100
pages
discussion
about
this
1951
loss
of
nationality.
i
said,
“these
passports
which
you
discovered
from
the
immigration
file”,
which
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
has
not
relied
on
in
his
brief
and
you
want
to
bring
this
in,
it
can
only
have
one
purpose
to
prejudice
this
court
against
this
individual
and
i
object.
and
if
you
do
it,
i
will
tell
the
court
it's
improper
and
i
object”,
which
i'm
telling
the
court.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
that
if
this
--
that
this
court
has
a
complete
record
here
on
which
to
rule
whether
mr.
afroyim
lost
his
nationality
by
his
vote
1951.
if
he
did
not
lose
it
by
his
vote
in
1951,
the
department
state
of
the
united
states
is
perfectly
free
to
tell
him
that
he
lost
it
by
having
a
passport,
by
voting
in
a
1952
election,
by
voting
in
a
1953
election
or
any
other
ground
which
they
want
to
imply
although
its
not
expressed
in
the
loss
of
nationality
provisions.
this
is
a
separate
proceeding.
this
isn't
a
matter
at
large
to
decide
whether
mr.
afroyim
lost
his
nationality
by
four
or
five
of
the
20
acts
set
there.
it's
to
decide
whether
he
lost
it
by
voting
in
1951.
and
this
record
is
100
percent
complete
on
that
issue
because
it's
a
100
pages
of
passport
review
testimony
limited
to
that
issue.
these
passports
are
not
in
this
case;
they
have
no
business
in
the
case
and
they're
--
here
they
merely
confused
issue
and
why.
because
the
government
perhaps
now
feels
that
since
as
part
of
the
passport
record,
as
part
of
this
appeal
record,
there
was
this
identification
document
which
everybody
who
resides
in
israel
gets
and
that
has
in
it
an
indication
that
he
voted
in
a
municipal
election
and
in
other
elections.
but
the
department
of
state,
knowing
this,
did
not
decide
to
wholly
was
expatriated
for
those
elections.
this
--
the
department
of
state
decided
and
all
we
have
here
is
the
decision
whether
he
lost
his
nationality
by
voting
in
the
1951
election,
there's
nothing
else
in
the
case
and
this
record
is
entirely
complete
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
perez
is
a
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit,
which
unanimously
affirmed
a
summary
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
holding
that
the
petitioner
had
expatriated
himself
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
401
(e)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940
by
the
act
of
voting
in
an
election
in
the
state
of
israel
in
1951
for
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
israel.
this
case
was
to
be
argued
by
the
general
counsel
for
the
new
york
civil
liberties
union
nanette
dembitz-berman,
who
wrote
the
briefs
in
the
case
and
it
is
mrs.
berman's
appointment
as
a
judge
of
the
family
court
of
the
city
of
new
york
that
brings
me
here
today.
she
is
very
disappointed
that
she
missed
this
opportunity
to
address
the
court
on
this
subject.
the
facts
are
very
simple
and
are
stated
in
a
stipulation
of
facts
which
appears
in
the
record
and
--
at
page
11
and
are
simply
that
the
petitioner
who
was
born
in
poland
in
1893,
immigrated
to
the
united
states
in
1912,
was
naturalized
in
1926
and
went
to
israel
in
1949,
a
year
after
that
state
was
established
in
1948.
and
in
1951,
he
voted
for
the
second
knesset,
which
was
the
second
election
of
the
legislature
of
israel.
at
that
time
indeed,
when
there
was
no
israeli
citizenship
at
all
and
that
everyone
who
voted
in
that
election,
voted
on
the
basis
of
their
residence
in
israel.
indeed,
it
was
that
legislature
which
a
year
later
adopted
the
first
israeli
law
of
nationality
and
established
israeli
nationality.
the
district
court,
in
the
basis
of
the
stipulation
of
facts
in
which
it
appeared
that
the
petitioner
voluntarily
voted
in
that
political
election,
stated
that
it
was
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
perez
case
in
1958
and
held
that
he
had
lost
his
citizenship
as
indeed
when
he
applied
for
a
united
states
passport
in
1960
to
return
to
the
united
states,
the
consul
in
israel
so
determined
and
the
state
department
approved
that
loss
of
citizenship
and
when
he
did
return,
he
obtained
a
full
hearing,
which
is
part
of
the
record,
before
the
passport
review
board
which
affirmed
this
loss
of
nationality
and
then
he
brought
this
--
this
action.
the
record
does
indicate
that
the
man's
profession,
he
was
an
artist
by
profession,
a
painter
and
sculptor,
and
indeed
in
this
country,
he
has
some
of
his
paintings
which
are
products
of
the
wpa
art
program
in
some
of
our
high
schools
and
hospitals.
the
case
presents
squarely
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
401
(e)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
which
is
repeated
in
haec
verba
in
sections
349
of
the
present
immigration
and
nationality
act.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
over
--
yes,
overruled
perez,
which
is
now.
mr.
justice
harlan,
when
i
--
i
recognize
the
--
from
the
facts
of
the
reargument
that
was
ordered
in
perez,
the
100
pages
of
opinions
on
that
--
in
that
case
and
the
trop
case,
the
75
of
pages
of
opinion
in
the
mendoza
case
which
followed
a
year
--
few
years
later,
in
which
again
the
court
ordered
rearguments.
when
i
read
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
those
cases
and
read
the
records
in
the
briefs,
i
must
say
i
was
nonplussed
as
to
what
i've
read
to
the
consideration
of
the
court
of
this
--
again
of
this
issue,
which
has
been
obviously
so
painstakingly
considered
by
the
court.
in
the
short
time
that
is
available
to
me,
i
felt
it
would
be
bootless
and
of
no
assistance
to
the
court
to
try
to
review
here
the
formulations
of
the
applicable
constitutional
doctrine.
most
of
the
justices
are
sitting
here
have
expressed
themselves
on
the
constitutional
doctrine.
it
occurred
to
me
that
in
my
short
time,
i
might
assist
the
court
by
examining
very
briefly
the
two
factual
propositions
which
are,
i
submit,
accepted
by
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
present
case
and
which
i
believe
are
factually
false.
one
of
those
propositions
in
which
the
solicitor
general
bases
his
argument,
one
of
those
propositions
is
that
for
an
american
citizen
to
vote
in
a
foreign
election
is
an
indication
of
some
diminution
of
his
allegiance
to
the
united
states
and
some
adherence
to
a
foreign
allegiance.
the
other
proposition
is
that
for
an
american
citizen
to
so
vote
in
a
foreign
election,
in
some
way
embroils
the
united
states
in
foreign
affairs
or
in
some
way
exacerbates
or
makes
more
difficult
the
handling
of
foreign
affairs.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
very
briefly
that
both
of
those
propositions
are
factually
inaccurate.
now,
as
to
the
first
proposition,
that
voting
in
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
certainly.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
agree
--
subject
to
my
basic
constitutional
position
that
where
we're
dealing
with
citizenship
granted
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
congress
has
much
less
authority
and
indeed,
my
final
proposition
is
that
congress
has
no
authority,
under
the
constitution
to
remove
united
states
citizenship
that
this
can
only
be
done
by
the
voluntary
act
of
the
united
states
citizen
and
all
that
the
power
of
congress
is,
is
to
regulate
the
manner
in
which
this
voluntary
expatriation
shall
be
expressed.
obviously,
a
man
cannot
put
a
note
of
expatriation
on
his
desk
floor
and
take
it
out
when
he
wants
to.
congress
can
say
that
if
you
wish
to
adjure
allegiance
to
the
united
states,
if
you're
abroad,
you
must
do
it
before
a
consul.
if
you
are
in
the
united
states,
you
must
do
it
on
the
forms
supplied
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
the
limit
of
congress'
power
is
to
regulate
voluntary
conduct
or
conduct
which
in
most
instances
or
in
common
experience
is
voluntary.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
provides
that
every
person
born
in
the
united
states
or
naturalized
alien
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
in
which
he
resides.
and
from
the
opinions
expressed
by
some
of
the
justices
that
this
sets
up
a
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
its
citizens,
which
the
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
terminate,
that
the
relationship
of
citizenship
can
only
be
terminated
by
the
act
of
the
individual
and
that
congress
is
therefore
limited
to
regulating
those
voluntary
acts.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
none
at
all.
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
it's
plain
that
a
naturalization
in
the
foreign
state
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
--
the
clearest
indication
of
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
my
--
my
--
my
personally
belief
that
congress
may
take
conduct
which
normally
connotes
a
putting
off
of
your
united
states
allegiance
and
taking
on
a
foreign
allegiance
and
may
nominate
that
may
--
as
a
control
of
voluntary
conduct
may
say
that
that
is
expatriation.
even
though
the
individual
says
that,
“i
denied
what
i'm
doing,”
has
a
natural
effect
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
i
--
well
--
we're
standing
on
a
very
narrow
ground,
your
honor,
of
whether
conduct
which
in
common
experience
is
considered
voluntary,
whether
the
particular
individual
who
was
acting
voluntarily
and
becoming
as
i
said
that
i
don't
want
this
to
have
the
result
which
the
law
says
it
shall
have.
now,
i
say
that
that's
voluntary
conduct
and
all
that
the
congress
is
doing
and
all
that
it
can
do
constitutionally
is
recognized
this
effect
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
what
i
--
that's
what
i
want
to
come
to.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
but
the
trouble
with
that
is,
your
honor,
is
that
voting
as
a
factual
matter
does
not
indicate
a
maybe
voluntary
conduct
but
it's
not
voluntary
conduct
that
indicates
a
lack
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
or
the
adherence
to
a
foreign
state.
now,
let
me
very
briefly
just
state
one
page
of
history
on
this
matter.
this
came
into
the
law
in
1940.
our
courts,
from
the
founding
of
the
republic
until
1868,
in
many
opinions
of
this
court
and
other
courts,
had
considered
the
whole
problem
of
expatriation
and
indeed
a
very
strong
opinion
was
held
that
the
common
law
applied
and
that
allegiance
was
permanent
and
there
could
be
no
expatriation.
this
was
debated
in
the
courts.
there
were
cases
on
voting
for
example.
there
were
three
cases,
a
federal
case,
a
main
case,
and
iowa
case
in
which
the
individuals
had
voted
in
canadian
elections.
the
courts
unanimously
held
that
voting
was
not
an
indication
of
loss
of
united
states
allegiance.
these
cases
are
quoted
in
borchard's
diplomatic
protection
abroad
and
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
would
my
argument
be
the
same
without
the
fourteenth
amendment?
yes,
i
would
--
my
argument
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
would
derive
it
upon
the
nature
of
the
relation
to
count
--
the
relationship
between
the
government
and
its
citizens
under
our
constitution.
i
would
say
that
the
one
thing
that
congress
in
achieving
its
statutory
objectives
that
one
sanction
that
is
not
available
to
it
unless
the
constitution
gave
to
it
expressly
was
the
termination
of
citizenship,
the
termination
of
the
relation
between
the
state
and
one
of
its
--
one
of
its
members.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
are
you
--
is
your
honor
referring
to
mackenzie
in
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
your
honor,
the
opinions
of
the
court
have
discussed
mackenzie
as
a
suspension
of
citizenship
during
coverture
because
of
the
special
relationship
of
the
wife
as
part
of
the
husband.
i
think
that
deals
with
that
case
so
far
as
savorgnan
case
is
concerned
that
this
is
the
case
that
really
i
was
discussing
with
mr.
justice
white
where
a
woman
becomes
naturalized
in
the
foreign
state.
and
although
she
signed
the
papers
and
becomes
naturalized
and
abjures
allegiance
to
the
united
states,
she
said
“i
did
it
because
my
husband,
the
united
states
--
the
italian
consul
in
st.
louis
asked
me
to
do
it.
i
really
don't
want
to
lose
my
citizenship.”
i
am
content
to
take
the
position
that
conduct,
which
is
considered
normally
as
voluntary
conduct
that
merely
by
--
say
so,
the
individual
may
not
say
that
it
doesn't
have
the
result
that
law
said
it
does.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
an
examination
of
this
history
indicates
that
there
was
no
evil
that
congress
was
trying
to
prevent.
let
me
try
or
range
you
directly,
mr.
justice
clark
this
way.
and
on
the
second
factual
proposition
that
our
foreign
relations
might
be
affected,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
that
voting
in
foreign
elections,
there's
not
the
slightest
indication
that
voting
in
a
foreign
election
had
in
a
--
legally,
at
the
invitation
of
the
foreign
government
in
effect,
has
any
effect
on
our
foreign
relations.
let's
examine
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
this
was
--
this
was
recited
your
honor,
in
one
short
statement
which
i
will
refer
to.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
the
voting
at
that
time,
your
honor,
was
based
entirely
on
residence.
there
was
no
israeli
nationality.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
you
did
not
have
to
be
--
no,
you
did
not
have
to
be
foreign
national.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes,
but
let
me
tell
--
let
me
suggest
two
other
instances
your
honor,
which
perhaps
point
out
your
question.
this
1940
law
is
on
the
books
for
only
one
reason.
the
chairman
of
the
immigration
of
the
judiciary
committee,
immigration
subcommittee,
mr.
dickstein
of
new
york,
was
exercised
by
the
fact
that
german
aliens,
resident
aliens
and
naturalized
germans
went
back
to
the
czar
in
1935
and
voted
that
the
czar
should
be
german
rather
than
french.
this
didn't
bother
the
french
government.
it
didn't
bother
the
german
government,
it
didn't
bother
the
state
department
but
it
certainly
bothered
mr.
dickstein
and
he
proposed
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
he
set
up
a
commission
to
examine
the
nationality
laws
and
to
codify
it.
in
the
course
of
that
codification,
a
new
section
which
we're
dealing
with
crept
into
the
codification
which
the
--
which
was
transmitted
to
the
president
for
the
very
modest
letter
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
attorney
general
to
the
effect
that
these
are
only
suggestions
for
the
consideration
of
congress.
one
of
these
suggestions
was
voting
in
a
political
election
in
a
foreign
state
or
participating
in
an
election
of
plebiscite
to
determine
the
sovereignty
of
a
foreign
territory.
the
entire
support
for
that
proposal
is
in
two
short
paragraphs.
in
the
rest
of
this
report,
the
other
proposals
are
supported
by
judicial
decisions,
by
diplomatic
decisions,
the
correspondence
between
the
secretary
of
state
and
foreign
governments.
this
course
which
we're
dealing
with
has
two
sentences
in
it.
along
the
line,
your
honor,
suggested
without
any
factual
support
whatever
and
here's
what
they
are.
this
section
is
clear,
applicable
on
any
case
on
american
votes
in
a
political
election
in
a
foreign
state
whether
or
not
he's
a
national
thereof.
taking
an
active
part
in
the
political
affairs
of
a
foreign
state
by
voting
in
a
political
election
therein
is
believed
to
involve
a
political
attachment
and
practical
allegiance
thereto,
which
is
in
consistent
with
continued
allegiance
to
the
united
states
whether
or
not
the
person
in
question
has
acquired
the
nationality
of
the
foreign
state.
there
was
not
one
iota
of
factual
support
for
the
statement
prepared
by
the
state
department,
i
think
by
the
assistant
solicitor,
mr.
flournoy,
who
was
the
state
department
expert
for
many
years
on
nationality
questions.
at
the
suggestion
of
the
--
mr.
dickstein,
the
chairman
of
the
house
immigration
committee,
there
is
--
not
only
no
support
for
that
statement
but
the
factual
evidence
in
the
diplomatic
history
of
the
united
states
was
at
that
time
that
voting
in
a
foreign
election
was
not
an
indication
of
throwing
offered
or
any
diminution
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
for
taking
on
allegiance
to
a
foreign
state.
as
i've
indicated
to
the
court,
the
judicial
decisions
which
are
the
contrary,
the
diplomatic
correspondence
which
discussed
that
great
length
how
you
could
lose
united
states
nationality
was
limited
entirely
to
naturalization
abroad,
and
residing
abroad
as
part
of
that
naturalization,
or
adjuring
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
there
was
no
support
whatever
for
that
statement.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
when
mr.
perez
was
born
in
el
paso,
voted
in
a
mexican
election
for
president,
i
do
not
know,
your
honor,
whether
the
mexican
law
required
him
to
be
a
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
let
me
give
you
one,
a
bit
of
factual
information.
the
first
page
of
the
record
contains
mr.
afroyim's
identification
booklet
which
he
had
a
hand
in
when
he
voted.
that
lists
him
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
i
mean
there
wasn't
any
question
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
only
of
the
united
states
and
that
he
disclosed
this
and
voted
as
a
citizen.
now,
if
your
honor's
suggestion
is
that
this
case
might
be
distinguished
on
this
basis
from
the
matter
of
a
person
who
was
a
citizen
of
the
foreign
state,
all
i
can
say
that
the
statute
as
drawn
will
not
support
such
a
distinction
and
indeed,
my
last
argument
and
the
one
that
appeal
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
in
the
--
in
the
perez
case,
was
that
in
any
event
the
statute
that's
drawn
was
too
broad
because
it
covered
a
person,
an
american
citizen
who
voted
in
the
foreign
election
whether
or
not
the
circumstances
indicated
any
diminution
of
u.s.
allegiance
or
any
taking
on
of
a
foreign
allegiance.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
of
course,
i
understand
that.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well
except,
your
honor,
might
--
perceive,
of
course,
the
distinction
your
honor's
suggesting
that
i
do
not
stand
on
it.
this
law
has
been
held
to
take
away
the
united
states
citizenship
even
if
you
vote
in
a
municipal
election
as
to
whether
it
should
be
local
option
that
forbear
control
or
not.
this
law
has
been
--
by
the
people
administering
it
by
the
lower
trib
--
administrative
tribunals,
they
say
any
voting
in
a
foreign
political
election
or
in
a
plebiscite
takes
away
your
united
states
citizenship
and
i
do
not
think
that
your
honor's
distinction
will
support
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
because
i
do
not
believe
that
a
dual
citizen,
the
voting
in
a
foreign
election
and
exercising
his
rights
under
his
second
citizenship
indicates
any
desire
to
terminate
his
united
states
citizenship.
i
do
not
think
that
factual
supports
there.
at
any
rate,
it
is
curious
that
the
instance
which
brought
this
law
into
being
in
this
all
instance,
as
i
say
without
any
diplomatic
or
factual
or
judicial
support
was
this
voting
in
the
czar
which
disturbed
me
that
our
government
nor
the
other
two
governments
involved,
the
german
or
the
french
government.
but
it's
suggested
in
this
one
paragraph,
which
is
all
that
this
court
relied
on
in
perez.
in
any
event,
it
is
not
believed
that
an
american
national
should
be
permitted
to
participate
in
the
politics,
in
the
political
affairs
of
a
foreign
state
and
at
the
same
time
retain
his
american
nationality.
the
two
facts
would
seem
to
be
inconsistent
with
each
other.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
in
view
of
the
complete
lack
of
any
authority
for
that
statement,
it
is
purposely
extremely
tentative
in
its
own
terms.
it's
a
suggestion
and
curiously
enough,
congress
took
this
tentative
suggestion
and
passed
it
without
any
debate
at
all
and
put
this
into
the
nationality
act,
which
was
generally
a
codification
of
the
former
laws
and
edit
this
provision
without
any
debate
on
it.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
my
position
would
not
change
for
the
reason
that
i
do
not
believe
that
this
extremely
limited
power
of
congress
to
regulate
voluntary
expatriation
permits
congress
to
achieve
a
purpose
of
the
exercise
of
it
power's
namely
the
promotion
of
good
foreign
relations.
it
doesn't
put
in
congress'
hands
the
weapons
of
expatriation.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
that
is
a
--
that
is
perhaps
a
more
difficult
proposition
than
the
--
than
what
the
factual
proposition
is,
that
foreign
relations
are
not
exacerbated
by
voting
in
a
foreign
election
which
is
usually
at
the
invitation
of
the
foreign
government.
and
if
your
honor
will
read
again
the
majority
in
perez,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
for
the
court,
has
one
citation
and
for
the
proposition
that
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
might
be
affected
by
voting.
he
cites
one
article
in
the
american
journal
of
international
law,
mr.
bruce's
article
which
deals
entirely
with
the
question
of
private
persons
by
propaganda
in
our
soil
or
in
the
soil
of
one
nation
attacking
a
foreign
government
and
mr.
bruce
concludes
his
article
by
saying,
this
is
the
kind
of
private
conduct
which
cannot
be
controlled
in
our
country.
this
is
only
citations
of
the
court
for
the
proposition
that
congress
might
reasonably
think
that
voting
in
a
foreign
election
injured
our
foreign
relations
and
was
a
sufficient
basis
for
what
mr.
justice
brennan
has
called
the
“drastic
and
truly
terrible
remedy
of
expatriation”.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
well,
your
honor,
we
have
put
in
our
supplemental
brief
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
the
number
of
persons
who
have
lost
their
citizenship
by
voting
in
foreign
elections
in
just
the
last
few
years
and
it
runs
to
a
couple
of
thousand
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
unfortunately,
i
don't
have
the
--
ms.
dembitz
has
put
them
in
this
memorandum
and
she
obtained
these
facts
from
the
state
department
and
the
fact
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes
but
we
--
we
don't
--
i
don't
find
here,
your
honor,
the
particular
elections
that
were
involved
or
the
particular
statement
involved.
now,
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
i
have
wanted
to
refer,
your
honor,
to
this
factual
basis
because
frankly,
it
was
the
only
thing
in
reading
the
opinions
of
the
court
and
in
reading
all
of
the
briefs,
it
was
the
only
thing
that
i
had
--
that
i
thought
i
found
that
have
not
been
completely
explored
in
the
opinions
of
the
court
that
namely,
that
this
proposition
that
voting
in
the
foreign
election
did
indicate
some
diminution
of
allegiance
or
taking
on
a
foreign
list
was
just
erroneous
and
also
other
factual
proposition
that
our
foreign
relations
are
affected.
now,
let
me
give
you
other
example
and
i
will
sit
down.
in
addition
to
this
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
of
course
not,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
establish
any
such
thing.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
that's
correct.
now,
i
sit
down
with
calling
your
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
of
course,
your
honor.
i'll
sit
down
by
calling
your
honor's
attention
to
one
other
factual
matter.
congress
has
recognized
that
voting
in
a
foreign
election
in
effect
does
not
diminish
your
relation
--
your
allegiance
to
the
united
states
by
providing
--
by
having
to
amend
the
act;
to
provide
that
every
american
citizen
who
voted
in
italy
between
1946
and
1948
should
be
given
their
citizenship
back
because
it
was
recognized
that
often
voting
of
foreign
relation,
contrary
to
being
against
the
united
states
citizenship
may
be
done
at
the
instance
of
officials
of
the
united
states,
asking
for
support
of
a
foreign
government
by
american
citizens
residing
in
that
territory
who
are
eligible
to
vote.
so
that
the
american
citizens,
thousands
of
them,
who
voted
the
italian
elections
after
the
war
from
1946
to
1948
had
been
given
back
their
citizenship
by
congress,
recognizing,
i
submit,
in
effect
that
such
voting
is
not
a
voluntary
giving
off
up
your
citizenship.
if
i
have
--
i
think
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
no
further
argument
but
i've
been
a
member
of
this
court
for
30
years
and
i
would
not
submit
and
request
this
court
to
rule
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
and
improper
record.
what's
been
said
here
about
passport
is
entirely
out
of
order
and
in
two
minutes,
i
can
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
court
that
you
have
a
proper
record
and
a
proper
issue.
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
ennis
your
honor,
under
the
nationality
act
and
the
laws
of
nationality,
there
are
some
15
grounds.
now
the
way
it's
determined
whether
a
person
has
lost
it's
nationality.
he
goes
through
a
passport.
he
goes
to
the
consul.
this
printed
form,
your
honor,
certificate
of
laws
and
nationality,
he
gives
an
affidavit.
it's
made
out.
here's
the
certificate
that
he
lost
his
nationality
by
voting
in
an
election
on
july
30
of
1951
not
that
he
used
the
passport
there
who
was
naturalized
in
some
other
country.
that's
a
precise
issue.
and
the
certificate
of
nationality
was
issued.
now,
what
is
this
business
on
the
record?
when
he
got
to
the
united
states,
now
i
learned
from
my
friend
here
that
he
got
here
on
israeli
passport.
well,
may
be
that's
the
only
he
could
get
here
when
in
1960,
the
united
states
consul
said
he'd
lost
his
citizenship
and
that
he
--
and
he
came
here
to
bring
the
suit
to
get
it
back.
now,
what
happens?
when
the
consul
issues
this
certificate
of
nationality,
you
have
under
the
state
department
regulations
an
appeal
to
the
passport
review
board.
this
is
a
transcript
of
the
record,
100
pages
in
which
to
mr.
afroyim
himself
without
counsel
went
before
these
three
members
of
the
board
and
there
were
president
in
addition
to
the
three
members:
the
chief
of
the
foreign
operations
division
and
specialist
on
israeli
affairs.
now,
they
talked
to
mr.
afroyim
for
a
100
pages
and
they
talked
on
one
issue.
did
you
lose
your
nationality
when
you
voted
in
the
one
election
in
1951?
now,
in
the
basis
of
the
record
and
their
affirmance
of
the
consul's
action,
he
brought
an
action
in
the
district
court
and
his
attorney,
and
he
insist
the
united
states
attorney
assisted
by
the
attorney
for
the
district
court
as
well
the
immigration
service,
do
stipulation
of
the
facts.
now
on
page
11
it
says
that,
“on
november
14,
1960,
the
american
consul
in
haiti
ruled
he
had
lost
his
--
that
he
had
expatriated
himself
on
july
30
of
1951
by
voting
in
a
political
election
in
a
foreign
state.
that's
all
that
was
in
the
case.
it
was
whether
that
vote
lost
his
nationality.
now,
in
addition
to
the
stipulation,
the
government
brought
in
at
the
hearing
before
the
district
judge
the
administrative
file
offered
in
evidence.
it's
limited
to
the
1950
--
to
the
--
1951
issue.
we
made
no
objection,
his
attorney
at
that
time.
and
this
is
part
of
the
record
and
it's
in
this
court.
but
still,
the
issue
is
only
one
simple
thing.
did
you
lose
your
citizenship
by
voting
in
1951?
now,
my
friend,
mr.
gordon
called
me
and
he
said,
“i
found
out
that
your
client
had
a
passport,
an
israeli
passport.”
i
said,
“charles”,
i
said
this,
“i
don't
--
i
didn't
know
that.”
i
said,
“this
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.”
the
nationality
act
does
not
make
having
a
foreign
passport.
it
was
in
--
by
the
way,
it
was
in
described
to
the
'40
act.
it
was
stricken
out
by
congress
using
a
foreign
passport.
i
said,
“charles,
it's
not
in
the
record.
the
record
is
limited
--
i'm
perfectly
happy.
i
have
the
record
included
this
100
pages
discussion
about
this
1951
loss
of
nationality.
i
said,
“these
passports
which
you
discovered
from
the
immigration
file”,
which
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
has
not
relied
on
in
his
brief
and
you
want
to
bring
this
in,
it
can
only
have
one
purpose
to
prejudice
this
court
against
this
individual
and
i
object.
and
if
you
do
it,
i
will
tell
the
court
it's
improper
and
i
object”,
which
i'm
telling
the
court.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
that
if
this
--
that
this
court
has
a
complete
record
here
on
which
to
rule
whether
mr.
afroyim
lost
his
nationality
by
his
vote
1951.
if
he
did
not
lose
it
by
his
vote
in
1951,
the
department
state
of
the
united
states
is
perfectly
free
to
tell
him
that
he
lost
it
by
having
a
passport,
by
voting
in
a
1952
election,
by
voting
in
a
1953
election
or
any
other
ground
which
they
want
to
imply
although
its
not
expressed
in
the
loss
of
nationality
provisions.
this
is
a
separate
proceeding.
this
isn't
a
matter
at
large
to
decide
whether
mr.
afroyim
lost
his
nationality
by
four
or
five
of
the
20
acts
set
there.
it's
to
decide
whether
he
lost
it
by
voting
in
1951.
and
this
record
is
100
percent
complete
on
that
issue
because
it's
a
100
pages
of
passport
review
testimony
limited
to
that
issue.
these
passports
are
not
in
this
case;
they
have
no
business
in
the
case
and
they're
--
here
they
merely
confused
issue
and
why.
because
the
government
perhaps
now
feels
that
since
as
part
of
the
passport
record,
as
part
of
this
appeal
record,
there
was
this
identification
document
which
everybody
who
resides
in
israel
gets
and
that
has
in
it
an
indication
that
he
voted
in
a
municipal
election
and
in
other
elections.
but
the
department
of
state,
knowing
this,
did
not
decide
to
wholly
was
expatriated
for
those
elections.
this
--
the
department
of
state
decided
and
all
we
have
here
is
the
decision
whether
he
lost
his
nationality
by
voting
in
the
1951
election,
there's
nothing
else
in
the
case
and
this
record
is
entirely
complete
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
perez
is
a
law
of
the
united
states.
