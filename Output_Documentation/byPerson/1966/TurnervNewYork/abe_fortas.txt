fortas
the
may
2nd
name
refers
to
castro
based
on
the
cuban
events.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
costmary
for
the
new
york
police
to
go
around
with
the
tape
recorders
concealed
under
their
clothes
or
is
this
policeman
especially
equipped
for
this
particular
meeting
in
view
of
the
subject
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we
may
fairly
infer
then
before
this
meeting
began,
the
new
york
police
regarded
that
as
one
deserving
of
the
special
consideration.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
state
then
does
not
contend
that
this
meeting
was
held
in
a
place
that
is
improper
for
meetings.
i
take
it
the
state
does
not
say
that,
the
state's
contention
is
solely
that
the
manner
in
which
this
meeting
was
run
constituted
in
obstruction
of
traffic
etcetera.
am
i
correct
in
this?
