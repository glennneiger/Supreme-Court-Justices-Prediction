mr.
h.
richard
uviller
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
appreciate
the
permission
which
i
received
from
the
court
to
make
use
of
this
visual
aid
and
i
have
asked
that
it
would
be
distributed
to
the
bench
a
rather
poor
quality
photograph
of
the
same
thing.
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
appreciate
what
the
physical
location
in
which
these
events
took
place
was.
now
this
is
what
we
call
a
square
in
new
york.
as
you
can
see
it
is
an
island
between
two
major
arteries
in
the
center
of
manhattan,
7th
avenue
on
the
one
side
and
broadway
on
the
other.
indeed
it
was
referred
to
throughout
the
record
in
this
case
and
is
commonly
referred
to
in
new
york
as
part
of
times
square.
times
square
itself
being
an
ill
defined
area,
not
a
square
at
all
either,
but
generally
considered
to
be
an
open
space
bounded
on
the
one
side
by
east
side
of
7th
avenue
and
on
the
other
by
the
west
side
of
broadway
and
extending
to
the
north
side
of
47th
street
on
the
north
and
down
as
far
as
the
north
side
of
what
used
to
be
the
times
tower
building
which
is
on
approximately
43rd
street.
there
is
a
large
commercial
section
within
that
area
and
indeed
in
the
part
depicted
on
this
chart
between
47th
and
46th
street
there
are
movie
theaters,
lining
this
sidewalk
over
here
together
with
places
for
eating,
amusement
and
some
gift
shops.
about
the
same
is
true
on
the
other
side
of
broadway
and
indeed
as
is
well
known
times
square
is
a
heart
in
manhattan
and
an
attraction
under
normal
circumstances
not
only
to
residents
of
manhattan,
but
to
the
visitors
to
new
york
as
well.
at
the
time
that
events
here
in
question
took
place
we
had
a
so
called
world
fair
in
progress
in
new
york
and
so
that
the
--
as
testified
in
the
record
the
normal
influx
of
visitors
which
we
would
expect
on
a
saturday
afternoon
in
august
was
somewhat
augmented
by
that
attraction.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
two
and
a
half
years
ago,
that's
1964.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
now
coming
to
this
island
which
is
known
as
duffy
square
itself,
the
central
part
of
duffy
square
is
a
statue
of
father
duffy
located
in
this
small
enclosed
area
enclosed
by
a
fence
and
elevated
by
about
three
or
four
steps
from
the
rest
of
this
concrete
island.
the
area
north
of
this
statue
is
really
not
involved
in
this
case.
apparently
nothing
took
place
in
that
area
with
the
possible
exception,
a
rather
vague
testimony
that
they
may
have
been
some
police
officers
assembled
in
that
area
who
entered
the
scene
somewhat
later.
the
speakers
for
this
meeting
were
located
on
the
south
steps
of
the
statue
approximately
in
this
position
here.
there
are
two
flag
poles
as
you
can
see
on
either
side
and
the
sidewalk
about
12
feet
on
either
side
of
the
statue
extends
fully
from
the
north
boundary
to
the
south
boundary
of
this
concrete
island.
the
sidewalk
i
should
say
is
not
delineated
or
demarcated
from
the
reminder
of
the
concrete
island
in
any
way,
but
as
you
can
see
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
statue
is
in
the
center
in
that
fenced
area,
it
flows
into
the
general
concrete
area
between
the
two
curves.
there
is
a
subway
grading
immediately
to
the
south
and
from
the
testimony
in
the
record
it's
quite
apparent
that
the
listeners
to
this
meeting,
the
group
which
has
been
estimated
in
size
variously
from
60
to
300
people
where
for
most
part
in
the
immediate
area
which
is
marked
by
the
subway
grading
standing
--.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir
it's
just
merely
a
grading
by
which
air
is
allowed
down
into
the
tunnel.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir.
there
are
bus
stops
as
marked
on
the
chart
on
the
7th
avenue
side,
two,
one
just
in
front
of
the
other
and
these
of
course
are
marked
by
signs
and
are
used
the
enter
the
various
7th
avenue
buses
that
proceed
south.
there
is
also
another
statue
located
at
the
far
south.
this
is
the
statue
of
george
m.
cohan
and
perhaps
it
should
be
called
cohan
square,
but
there
was
nobody
standing
in
that
immediate
area
either.
in
between
is
a
small
planting
area
in
which
there
is
some
greenery.
apparently
no
one
in
this
meeting
with
the
approximate
exception
of
some
newspaper
reporters
were
standing
anywhere
in
this
vicinity.
therefore
this
entire
meeting
took
place
in
rather
limited
part
of
this
rather
small
island
between
the
steps
here
and
the
south
end
of
the
subway
grading
here.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
i
had
just
concluded
a
brief
description
of
the
physical
area
known
as
duffy
square,
the
narrow
triangular
concrete
island
in
the
middle
of
times
square
manhattan.
at
about
4
pm
on
a
saturday
afternoon
in
august,
a
group
of
people
began
to
congregate
in
front
of
the
statue
erected
to
--
for
the
duffy
in
response
to
some
10,000
leaflets
which
had
been
distributed
announcing
the
meeting.
at
that
hour
at
4:00
pm,
mr.
lao
one
of
the
petitioners
ascended
the
steps
in
front
of
the
statue
and
with
the
use
of
a
hand
amplification
device
known
as
a
bullhorn
or
a
battery
powered
megaphone
began
to
address
this
group
which
has
been
variously
estimated
at
between
60
and
300
people.
the
group
was
by
all
accounts
orderly.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
disturbance,
any
violence,
although
there
was
a
drum
that
was
used
at
some
point
or
another
during
this
proceedings,
there
was
no
allegation
by
the
prosecution
of
any
disorder
by
that
group.
mr.
lao
announced
that
this
was
a
meeting
called
by
an
organization
called
may
2nd
movement
and
he
said
what
the
purpose
was
and
he
stated
his
intention
to
introduce
chairmen
and
speakers
and
made
no
statement
really
of
any
consequence
on
the
purpose
or
content
of
the
--
of
the
meeting.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
may
2nd
movement.
it
entirely
was
a
group
that
had
been
formed
sometime
before
described
by
one
of
the
petitioners
as
a
radical
piece
movement
and
for
the
specific
purpose
of
protesting
the
american
involvement
in
the
vietnam
conflict.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
thought
that
was
a
july
26th
day.
i
don't
know
what
may
2nd
refers
to,
but
the
organization
was
founded
according
to
the
testimony
mr.
justice
in
march,
but
it
was
entitled
the
may
2nd
movement.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
presumably,
no
testimony
in
the
record.
there
were
a
quite
number
of
them
as
to
where
they
all
hailed
from.
but
their
background
was
not
going
into
extensively
in
the
testimony.
in
any
event,
mr.
lao
then
turned
the
meeting
over
to
the
man
who
was
designated
as
the
chairman
and
who
subsequently
testified
that
he
was
one
of
the
organizers
of
this
meeting,
mr.
luce
who
was
not
arrested
and
is
not
a
petitioner
here
but
did
testify
at
the
trial.
mr.
luce
likewise
only
got
through
some
preliminary
statements
before
a
police
captain
approached
and
made
his
first
statement
to
the
speakers
and
leaders
of
this
meeting.
now,
there
was
a
question
raised
by
mr.
fraenkel
as
to
why
this
statement
by
the
police
officer
was
not
reproduced
on
the
recording
or
tape
that
was
played
and
which
did
quite
clearly
indicate
at
the
trial
what
each
of
the
speakers
had
said
to
the
crowd.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
this
is
quite
obvious,
the
speakers
who
were
speaking
through
this
amplification
device
whereas
the
police
officer
was
not.
so,
the
recording
device
which
was
secreted
on
one
of
the
police
officers
who
was
mingling
with
the
crowd
in
civilian
dress,
that
recording
device
reproduced
what
have
been
said
on
the
amplification
megaphone
but
not
what
the
police
officer
said.
however,
his
statement
has
been
variously
testified
to
on
his
first
approach.
it
was
according
to
the
police
officers
who
heard
it,
simply
that
they
were
interfering
with
traffic.
by
this
time,
a
description
of
the
crowd
indicates
that
they
had
moved
forward
crowding
toward
the
speaker
as
quite
not
true.
this
is
a
noisy
place
at
that
hour.
and
had
overlapped
the
two
sidewalk
areas
on
either
side
of
the
statue,
12
feet
in
width
each
and
indeed
some
of
them
had
spilled
over
from
the
concrete
island
in
to
the
traffic
lanes
of
broadway
in
7th
avenue
that
bound
this
so-called
square.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
police
officer
who
made
the
statement,
captain
mcallister
did
not
testify
but
other
--
the
other
police
officer
who
had
the
recording
device
and
was
present
with
the
crowd
heard
what
he
said
and
testified
as
to
what
he
said.
the
defendants
variously
testified
as
to
what
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
--
he
testified
that
on
the
first
approach
he
said,
“you
are
interfering
with
vehicular
and
pedestrian
traffic,
no
direction
to
disband
simply
a
statement
of
that
nature.
according
to
the
defendant
he
said,
“you
are
not
permitted
to
have
this
meeting”
or
“where
did
you
get
permission
for
this
meeting?”
or
“we
do
not
allow
meetings
at
this
point”.
and
i
think
i
should
mention
at
this
time
that
the
petitioner
here
makes
a
statement
in
his
brief
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
police
officer
announced
that
there
was
a
ban
on
meetings
of
political
dissent
in
this
area.
there
is
absolutely
no
shred
of
evidence
in
anywhere
in
this
record
that
there
was
any
ban
on
meetings
on
political
dissent.
indeed,
there
is
no
indication
that
this
was
a
response
to
the
content
of
the
meeting
at
all.
although
there
is
testimony
that
there
were
placards
for
example
displayed
during
the
course
of
this
meeting,
there
is
no
testimony
in
this
record
as
to
what
was
on
the
placards,
what
they
said
or
whether
the
police
officers
perceived
them
or
reacted
to
them.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
new
york
police
department
has
a
bureau
which
is
called
the
bureau
of
special
services.
it
is
not
clear
from
this
record
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
infer
from
the
record
that
it
is
the
obligation
or
duty
of
these
specially
trained
police
officers
to
attend
meetings
of
groups
that
are
thought
to
be
possibly
hostile
or
dangerous
and
to
perceive
or
listen
to
what
it
--
what
is
stated
in
public
meetings.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
is
fair
to
infer,
yes
justice
fortas.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
officer
from
this
bureau
of
special
services
testified
that
he
had
recognized
and
was
familiar
with
the
faces
and
voices
of
the
leaders
of
this
particular
organization.
he
has
seen
them
on
previous
occasion.
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
not
--
it
was
not
from
the
bureau
of
special
services
that
the
ordinary
precinct
policemen
attended
this
meeting.
as
i
say,
it
was
announced
by
a
public
distribution
of
some
10,000
leaflets.
in
any
event
at
this
point,
no
other
policemen
were
on
the
scene
with
the
exception
of
captain
mcallister.
there
is
then
some
testimony
in
the
record
indicating
that
the
police
officers
attempted
to
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
i
say
justice
brennan,
it's
unclear.
the
estimates
vary
from
60
to
300.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
at
that
time.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
apparently,
the
group
did
not
change
in
size
although
during
this
period
a
number
of
onlookers
not
an
immediate
audience,
it
varies
really
--
estimated
at
several
thousand
gathered
on
the
opposite
sidewalk.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
presumably,
the
bullhorn
would
carry
though
not
distinctly
and
depending
on
the
variations
of
traffic
noise.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
certainly
happens
in
new
york,
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
this
is
the
12-ft
distance
to
the
curve
of
the
--
of
duffy
square.
the
front
of
the
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
immediate
audience
was
located
in
this
area
on
the
square.
roughly
it
covers
the
area
represented
by
the
subway
grade.
the
onlookers
while
their
position
was
not
described
with
clarity,
apparently
where
at
this
distance
on
this
side.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
in
new
york,
this
record
does
indicate
that
new
york
has
a
permit
requirement
for
the
use
of
a
bullhorn
and
that
was
prosecuted
jointly
with
this
trial
but
the
conviction
for
two
--
the
two
individuals
who
used
the
horn
for
using
it
without
a
permit
is
not
before
this
court
at
this
time.
there
is
apparently
also
some
requirement
for
a
permit
for
the
use
of
a
public
park
for
these
meetings.
now,
and
point
of
the
fact
this
duffy
square
is
technically
a
public
park,
however,
there
was
no
proof
in
this
record
to
that
effect
and
indeed
they
were
not
prosecuted
for
having
use
a
public
park
without
a
permit.
the
permit
requirement
by
the
way
in
new
york
is
an
automatic
one,
the
law
requires
that
on
application
a
permit
shall
issue.
so
there
is
no
discretionary
issue
there.
in
any
event,
the
crowd
was
completely
orderly
at
this
time
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
certain
individuals
had
spilled
over
into
street.
now,
the
police
officers
tried
to
move
them
back
and
they
tried
to
open
a
path
along
the
sidewalk
but
found
that
they
were
unable
to
do
so.
at
this
point,
there
was
a
second
approach
and
under
--
the
second
approach
apparently
repeated
the
injunction
that
they
were
obstructing
vehicular
traffic,
pedestrian
traffic
and
in
addition,
the
police
officer
said,
“you'll
have
to
disband
the
meeting”.
now,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
was
a
reaction
to
the
situation
as
it
developed
or
the
result
of
a
predetermined
plan
by
the
police
officer
was
raised
and
indeed,
the
counsel
--
trial
counsel
tried
to
establish
that
there
was
some
sort
of
ban.
they
say
the
record
is
not
altogether
clear
as
to
whether
there
was
a
ban
and
if
there
was
a
ban,
who
had
directed
it
or
what
the
nature
of
it
was.
but
on
the
record
on
which
these
individuals
were
convicted,
there
is
only
the
faintest
hint
of
any
such
ban
and
if
indeed
there
was
a
ban,
it
was
simply
a
ban
on
meetings
of
any
sort
in
this
area.
now,
there
was
a
question
yesterday,
i
believe,
directed
to
mr.
fraenkel
as
to
whether
or
not
there
hadn't
been
some
evidence
that
a
police
officer
had
offered
alternative
site
to
these
individuals.
now,
mr.
fraenkel,
in
answering
in
a
negative
overlooked
the
testimony
of
one
of
his
own
witnesses
who
testified
that
police
officer
when
he
first
came
up
to
the
leader
of
the
group
said,
“why
don't
you
hold
your
meeting
south
of
48th
street
or
north
of
59th
street?”
now,
that
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
that's
on
page
200.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
200
of
the
record.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
the
sum
and
substance
of
it.
there
was
no
evidence
for
example
that
there
was
any
disorder
of
a
violent
or
threatening
type
and
there
was
certainly
no
evidence
that
the
police
were
reacting
to
the
content
of
what
was
being
said.
indeed,
there
was
not
very
much
that
have
been
said.
i
think
that
the
record
as
it
reproduces
the
tape
recording
of
what
the
speakers
had
said
will
indicate
one
sentence
only
on
the
content
and
that
was
something
along
the
lines
that
the
american
policy
in
vietnam
was
ill
advised.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
record
photograph
--
the
photograph
of
the
square,
i
think,
dramatically
reveals
what
the
usual
use
of
it
is.
there
are
two
bus
stops,
there
are
benches,
there
are
some
foliage,
there
are
crosswalks
on
either
end,
and
north
to
south
sidewalk
running
on
lawn.
it
is
as
you
can
see
simply
a
traffic
dividing
the
island
in
point
of
fact
and
its
customary
use
is
simply
that
which
is
disclosed
by
the
photograph.
now,
i
should
say
that
there
were
efforts
made
by
counsel
at
the
trial
to
establish
that
there
had
been
other
demonstrations
at
other
times
or
other
meetings
or
rallies
held
in
the
time
square
area.
the
trial
judge
excluded
this
evidence
on
the
grounds
of
irrelevancy.
it
was
not
really
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
area
or
any
other
part
of
times
square
were
used
for
bon
rallies
or
new
year's
eve
celebrations,
it
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
group
was
too
large
to
be
comfortably
contained
within
this
island
that
without
presenting
an
interference
to
the
flow
of
vehicular
traffic
which
is
considerable
and
the
passage
of
pedestrians
using
the
sidewalks.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
only
know
what
the
record
reveals
justice
stewart
on
that
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
distribution
of
10,000
leaflets
inviting
people
to
a
rally
protesting
the
war
in
vietnam
at
duffy
square,
4
o'clock
and
that's
apparently
the
only
matter
and
which
are
cited
to
our
brief.
there
was
a
testimony
by
a
newspaper
reporter
for
example
that
he
got
one
of
those
fliers
or
announcements
on
the
city
desk
in
the
usual
course,
i
mean,
which
newspapers
get
these
announcements.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
precisely
correct,
justice
fortas.
we
--
we
--
there
is
no
contention
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
this
anymore
than
any
other
sidewalk
meeting
as
in
shuttlesworth
or
anything
of
that
sort.
our
--
our
only
contention
is
that
as
this
meeting
developed
it
was
too
large
for
the
place
and
the
police
reacted
to
that.
apparently
what
happened
was
that
after
this
failure
and
attempt
to
get
people
back
on
the
sidewalk,
there
were
some
testimony
that
automobiles
coming
at
--
from
south
of
the
avenue
had
to
veer
to
avoid
pedestrians
in
the
street,
that
people
using
the
bus
stops
and
so
on
had
to
walk
in
the
roadway
and
so
on.
there
must
have
been
a
gesture
or
signal
or
some
communication
because
at
that
point,
some
12
to
15
blue
coded
patrolman
and
two
mounted
patrolman
appeared.
where
they
have
geared
from
is
not
altogether
clear,
whether
they
were
waiting
or
--
or
where
they're
waiting
is
not
clear.
one
of
the
defendants
testified
that
that
they
appeared
from
behind
the
statue
in
this
area.
and
at
that
point,
they
started
to
disperse
the
crowd.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
correct,
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
presume
so,
whether
they
actually
held
of
not
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
does
at
the
present
time
and
i
think
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
at
that
time,
it
did
on
--
on
one
avenue
and
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
i
--
i
think
it
might
have
been
at
that
time
one-way
traffic
on
both
stops.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
bus
stop
would
indicate
that
there
was
south-going
traffic
only
on
7th
avenue
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
believe
broadway
has
been
one-way
for
some
time.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
south
going,
yes
sir.
there
had
been
or
some
--
i
can
--
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
we
--
we
in
new
york
have
observed
in
this
general
area
certain
kinds
of
demonstrations
and
protests
that
have
proceeded
without
any
interference.
i'm
thinking
of
one
which
was
a
silent
vigil
so-called
which
pickets
stood
with
signs
around
the
area,
not
a
meeting,
but
stood
with
protest
signs
for
some
period
of
time
around
the
times
square
area,
without
any
interference.
in
any
event,
the
--
i
think
one
of
the
clearest
indications
in
this
record
that
there
was
no
reaction
by
the
police
to
the
content
or
substance
of
what
was
being
said,
was
the
fact
that
the
chairman
of
this
meeting
and
the
organizer,
luce,
was
never
arrested.
the
only
people
who
were
arrested
in
this
case
were
those
who
fail
to
heed
the
police
order
to
disperse.
now,
under
subdivision
3
of
our
disorderly
conduct
statute,
it
is
a
disorderly
conduct
to
refuse
a
police
order
to
move
on.
that
statute
has
been
construed
by
the
new
york
state
court
in
a
limited
fashion.
it
is
only
the
reasonable
order
by
the
police
and
the
substantial
purpose
of
the
order
which
constitutes
the
offense.
in
other
words,
an
order
which
is
without
foundation
or
based
upon
whim,
can
be
disobeyed
without
a
violation
of
that
disorderly
conduct
provision.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
it
does.
they
refused
in
various
ways.
this
is
the
part
of
course
in
the
case
that
mr.
fraenkel
makes
his
point
on.
some
of
them
refused
by
lying
down,
some
by
sitting
down,
some
by
striking
police
officers,
biting
them,
one
by
striking
a
police
horse
with
a
rolled
up
placard,
others
by
just
simply
refusing,
and
indeed
responding
to
the
police
request
to
move
with
such
shouted
the
joiners
as
factious
police
could
stop
all,
“you
have
no
right,
we
have
rights”,
and
so
on.
but
each
of
the
defendants
who
is
arrested
in
this
case
was
one
who
in
someway
or
another
refused
to
heed
the
police
order
which
have
been
repeated
not
only
by
the
police
officer
who
first
made
the
direction
but
by
the
individual
officers
who
made
the
arrest.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
17
i
believe.
well,
there's
17
convictions,
justice
harlan.
i
am
not
quite
sure
how
many
were
arrested.
there
may
have
been
some
that
were
dismissed
before.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
jail
sentences,
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
estimates
are
that
there
were
between
12
and
15
on
foot
and
two
on
horseback.
this
was
at
about
25
minutes
after
four.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
time
specified
in
the
complaint.
they
were
charged
in
this
complaint
with
three
--
aside
from
the
administrative
code
violations
for
the
use
of
the
megaphone,
with
three
--
violation
of
three
subdivisions
of
the
disorderly
conduct
statute.
this
is
set
forth
in
the
complaint,
subdivisions
2,
3,
and
4.
3
as
i've
indicated
is
the
one
which
is
failure
to
move
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
serious
dispute
with
the
conviction
there.
these
were
in
the
alternative.
that
is
to
say
this
was
not
a
disjunctive
charge,
and
the
conviction,
the
general
verdict
of
the
court
guilty
i
think
should
be
fairly
construed
and
this
distinguishes
that
case
from
stromberg
cited
by
my
adversary
as
a
conjunctive
charges
to
say,
if
this
conviction
can
be
sustained
under
any
one
these
subdivisions,
then
there
is
no
need
to
reverse
the
conviction
based
on
the
general
verdict
of
guilty
as
charged.
there
was
as
i
say
no
disorder
until
the
order
of
the
police
to
move
on.
now,
one
of
these
subdivisions,
subdivision
2
charges
the
defendants
with
creating
a
disturbance,
tending
to
breach
the
peace,
annoying
to
others.
that
is
the
language
of
subdivision
2.
and
indeed
it
is
that
conviction
which
is
principally
challenged
by
my
adversary.
he
claims
that
the
complaint
does
not
charge
that
particular
offense
and
consequently
any
conviction
based
upon
evidence
as
to
what
--
of
what
occurred
after
the
order
to
disperse
in
not
fairly
charged
in
the
complaint
and
therefore
violation
of
due
process.
the
complaint
appears
itself
on
page
1
of
the
record
and
i
think
in
a
fair
reading
of
it
and
then
by
the
way
i
do
think
that
it
should
be
read
fairly.
it
is
a
--
an
affidavit
by
a
police
officer
and
should
be
construed
in
harmony
with
the
ventresco
principle
indicates
that
not
only
were
each
of
the
subdivisions
specified
in
that
complaint,
but
the
language
of
the
complaint
has
one
phrase
at
least
dealing
with
each
of
them.
for
example,
did
unlawfully
congregate
and
assemble
in
the
area
obstructing
the
area
to
the
exclusion
of
those
wishing
to
use
the
same
would
indicate
the
reasonableness
of
the
police
order
to
move
on.
as
to
the
subdivision
3,
the
last
phrase
says
when
ordered
to
move
on,
the
defendants
did
fail
to
do
so.
that
is
the
substance
of
subdivision
3.
subdivision
2,
the
one
that
my
adversary
claims
was
not
properly
charged,
i
think
is
implicit
in
the
phrase,
“did
delay
vehicular
traffic
while
carrying
placards
and
using
loud
and
boisterous
language”.
and
the
only
allegation
of
loud
and
boisterous
language
was
the
loud
and
boisterous
language
used
by
the
defendants
after
the
order
to
move
on.
so
that
i
say
that
not
--
these
are
not
mutually
dependent
subsections.
in
other
words,
even
as
the
police
ordered
to
move
on
was
not
a
reasonable
order
and
of
course
the
new
york
courts
construed
it
as
such.
the
reaction
of
the
defendants
so
far
exceeded
the
proper
resistance
to
such
an
unlawful
order,
that
it
in
itself
became
a
disorderly
conduct.
in
other
words,
although
you
are
entitled
to
resist
an
unlawful
order
under
the
new
york
law
and
not
move
on
when
told
unreasonably
to
do
so,
you
cannot
resist
it
in
such
a
loud
and
boisterous
manner
as
to
create
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
disturbance
and
annoyance
to
others.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct
sir.
they're
quite
independent.
they're
quite
independent,
even
though
as
i
say
the
actions
in
this
case
constituting
the
violation
of
subdivision
2
occurred
in
point
of
time
after
the
order.
the
court
--
the
only
court
that
wrote
an
opinion
in
this
case
was
the
appellate
term,
the
court
of
first
review.
and
that
court
in
a
long
opinion
found
that
implicit
in
this
complaint
was
the
charge
of
the
actions
occurring
after
the
order
to
disperse
because
it
was
charged
that
the
defendants
failed
to
move
on
when
directed
to
do
so.
that
is
really
i
think
the
principal
point
which
is
being
made
by
my
adversary,
one
of
pleading.
i
do
not
think
that
he
can
seriously
contend
that
there
was
in
this
instance
any
reaction
so
long
condemned
by
this
court
to
the
content
of
the
speech
or
an
attempt
to
break
up
the
meeting
because
the
views
being
expressed
were
unpopular
with
the
police
or
with
the
society
the
police
represent.
this
is
indeed,
i
think,
a
pure
instance
of
the
type
of
situation
which
this
court
i
believe
has
in
an
unbroken
line
of
authority
and
virtually
every
member
of
the
court
who
has
written
on
this
subject
has
agreed
is
a
proper
police
function.
and
that
is
that
the
police
have
the
right
to
regulate
the
manner
of
expression
of
speech
consistent
with
the
interests
of
society
in
maintaining
free
thoroughfare
and
the
free
use
of
the
streets
to
those
wishing
to
engage
in
ordinary
commerce.
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
at
this
point
that
such
regulation
of
the
manner,
time,
and
place
are
expression
of
ideas
or
assembling
does
not
constitute
any
first
amendment
infringement.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
there
is
actually
one
division
of
subdivision
of
722
of
disorderly
conduct
does
subdivision
4.
one
of
those
that
the
defendants
was
convicted
of
states
that
anyone
who
by
his
actions,
tending
to
breach
the
peace,
causes
the
crowd
to
collect
other
than
while
lawfully
addressing
a
crowd
is
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct.
now,
that
subdivision
4
may
be
still
in
this
case
and
it
may
not
be.
it
was
never
considered
by
any
of
the
lower
courts
writing
on
it
--
on
this
case.
and
indeed
it
has
not
been
construed
by
our
highest
court.
so
we
have
not
relied
on
that
statute
nor
has
the
defendant
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
on
its
face.
that
is
the
only
statute
that
makes
any
specific
reference
to
an
address
to
a
public
assembly.
in
this
instance,
new
york
by
--
by
statute
does
leave
to
the
police
the
discretion
to
decide
when
there
has
been
an
interference
with
vehicular
traffic
and
that
discretion
is
reviewable
under
the
new
york
construction
of
722
that
his
judgment
must
be
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
consequently,
the
statute
on
its
face
must
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
construing
sections
to
limit
this
discretion
to
a
reasonable
order.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
as
applied
in
this
instance,
we
have
a
clear
example
of
a
reasonable
order
in
the
interest
of
vehicular
and
pedestrian
free
passage
of
where
the
police
simply
tried
to
convey
and
contain
the
group
and
when
they
fail
to
do
so,
to
disperse
the
group
which
was
a
traffic
menace,
and
did
so
without
any
regard
to
the
content
or
substance
of
abuse
that
were
being
expressed,
unlike
the
feiner
case.
i
think
that
element
is
out
of
this
case
altogether.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
appreciate
the
permission
which
i
received
from
the
court
to
make
use
of
this
visual
aid
and
i
have
asked
that
it
would
be
distributed
to
the
bench
a
rather
poor
quality
photograph
of
the
same
thing.
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
appreciate
what
the
physical
location
in
which
these
events
took
place
was.
now
this
is
what
we
call
a
square
in
new
york.
as
you
can
see
it
is
an
island
between
two
major
arteries
in
the
center
of
manhattan,
7th
avenue
on
the
one
side
and
broadway
on
the
other.
indeed
it
was
referred
to
throughout
the
record
in
this
case
and
is
commonly
referred
to
in
new
york
as
part
of
times
square.
times
square
itself
being
an
ill
defined
area,
not
a
square
at
all
either,
but
generally
considered
to
be
an
open
space
bounded
on
the
one
side
by
east
side
of
7th
avenue
and
on
the
other
by
the
west
side
of
broadway
and
extending
to
the
north
side
of
47th
street
on
the
north
and
down
as
far
as
the
north
side
of
what
used
to
be
the
times
tower
building
which
is
on
approximately
43rd
street.
there
is
a
large
commercial
section
within
that
area
and
indeed
in
the
part
depicted
on
this
chart
between
47th
and
46th
street
there
are
movie
theaters,
lining
this
sidewalk
over
here
together
with
places
for
eating,
amusement
and
some
gift
shops.
about
the
same
is
true
on
the
other
side
of
broadway
and
indeed
as
is
well
known
times
square
is
a
heart
in
manhattan
and
an
attraction
under
normal
circumstances
not
only
to
residents
of
manhattan,
but
to
the
visitors
to
new
york
as
well.
at
the
time
that
events
here
in
question
took
place
we
had
a
so
called
world
fair
in
progress
in
new
york
and
so
that
the
--
as
testified
in
the
record
the
normal
influx
of
visitors
which
we
would
expect
on
a
saturday
afternoon
in
august
was
somewhat
augmented
by
that
attraction.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
two
and
a
half
years
ago,
that's
1964.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
now
coming
to
this
island
which
is
known
as
duffy
square
itself,
the
central
part
of
duffy
square
is
a
statue
of
father
duffy
located
in
this
small
enclosed
area
enclosed
by
a
fence
and
elevated
by
about
three
or
four
steps
from
the
rest
of
this
concrete
island.
the
area
north
of
this
statue
is
really
not
involved
in
this
case.
apparently
nothing
took
place
in
that
area
with
the
possible
exception,
a
rather
vague
testimony
that
they
may
have
been
some
police
officers
assembled
in
that
area
who
entered
the
scene
somewhat
later.
the
speakers
for
this
meeting
were
located
on
the
south
steps
of
the
statue
approximately
in
this
position
here.
there
are
two
flag
poles
as
you
can
see
on
either
side
and
the
sidewalk
about
12
feet
on
either
side
of
the
statue
extends
fully
from
the
north
boundary
to
the
south
boundary
of
this
concrete
island.
the
sidewalk
i
should
say
is
not
delineated
or
demarcated
from
the
reminder
of
the
concrete
island
in
any
way,
but
as
you
can
see
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
statue
is
in
the
center
in
that
fenced
area,
it
flows
into
the
general
concrete
area
between
the
two
curves.
there
is
a
subway
grading
immediately
to
the
south
and
from
the
testimony
in
the
record
it's
quite
apparent
that
the
listeners
to
this
meeting,
the
group
which
has
been
estimated
in
size
variously
from
60
to
300
people
where
for
most
part
in
the
immediate
area
which
is
marked
by
the
subway
grading
standing
--.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir
it's
just
merely
a
grading
by
which
air
is
allowed
down
into
the
tunnel.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
sir.
there
are
bus
stops
as
marked
on
the
chart
on
the
7th
avenue
side,
two,
one
just
in
front
of
the
other
and
these
of
course
are
marked
by
signs
and
are
used
the
enter
the
various
7th
avenue
buses
that
proceed
south.
there
is
also
another
statue
located
at
the
far
south.
this
is
the
statue
of
george
m.
cohan
and
perhaps
it
should
be
called
cohan
square,
but
there
was
nobody
standing
in
that
immediate
area
either.
in
between
is
a
small
planting
area
in
which
there
is
some
greenery.
apparently
no
one
in
this
meeting
with
the
approximate
exception
of
some
newspaper
reporters
were
standing
anywhere
in
this
vicinity.
therefore
this
entire
meeting
took
place
in
rather
limited
part
of
this
rather
small
island
between
the
steps
here
and
the
south
end
of
the
subway
grading
here.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
i
had
just
concluded
a
brief
description
of
the
physical
area
known
as
duffy
square,
the
narrow
triangular
concrete
island
in
the
middle
of
times
square
manhattan.
at
about
4
pm
on
a
saturday
afternoon
in
august,
a
group
of
people
began
to
congregate
in
front
of
the
statue
erected
to
--
for
the
duffy
in
response
to
some
10,000
leaflets
which
had
been
distributed
announcing
the
meeting.
at
that
hour
at
4:00
pm,
mr.
lao
one
of
the
petitioners
ascended
the
steps
in
front
of
the
statue
and
with
the
use
of
a
hand
amplification
device
known
as
a
bullhorn
or
a
battery
powered
megaphone
began
to
address
this
group
which
has
been
variously
estimated
at
between
60
and
300
people.
the
group
was
by
all
accounts
orderly.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
disturbance,
any
violence,
although
there
was
a
drum
that
was
used
at
some
point
or
another
during
this
proceedings,
there
was
no
allegation
by
the
prosecution
of
any
disorder
by
that
group.
mr.
lao
announced
that
this
was
a
meeting
called
by
an
organization
called
may
2nd
movement
and
he
said
what
the
purpose
was
and
he
stated
his
intention
to
introduce
chairmen
and
speakers
and
made
no
statement
really
of
any
consequence
on
the
purpose
or
content
of
the
--
of
the
meeting.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
may
2nd
movement.
it
entirely
was
a
group
that
had
been
formed
sometime
before
described
by
one
of
the
petitioners
as
a
radical
piece
movement
and
for
the
specific
purpose
of
protesting
the
american
involvement
in
the
vietnam
conflict.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
thought
that
was
a
july
26th
day.
i
don't
know
what
may
2nd
refers
to,
but
the
organization
was
founded
according
to
the
testimony
mr.
justice
in
march,
but
it
was
entitled
the
may
2nd
movement.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
presumably,
no
testimony
in
the
record.
there
were
a
quite
number
of
them
as
to
where
they
all
hailed
from.
but
their
background
was
not
going
into
extensively
in
the
testimony.
in
any
event,
mr.
lao
then
turned
the
meeting
over
to
the
man
who
was
designated
as
the
chairman
and
who
subsequently
testified
that
he
was
one
of
the
organizers
of
this
meeting,
mr.
luce
who
was
not
arrested
and
is
not
a
petitioner
here
but
did
testify
at
the
trial.
mr.
luce
likewise
only
got
through
some
preliminary
statements
before
a
police
captain
approached
and
made
his
first
statement
to
the
speakers
and
leaders
of
this
meeting.
now,
there
was
a
question
raised
by
mr.
fraenkel
as
to
why
this
statement
by
the
police
officer
was
not
reproduced
on
the
recording
or
tape
that
was
played
and
which
did
quite
clearly
indicate
at
the
trial
what
each
of
the
speakers
had
said
to
the
crowd.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
this
is
quite
obvious,
the
speakers
who
were
speaking
through
this
amplification
device
whereas
the
police
officer
was
not.
so,
the
recording
device
which
was
secreted
on
one
of
the
police
officers
who
was
mingling
with
the
crowd
in
civilian
dress,
that
recording
device
reproduced
what
have
been
said
on
the
amplification
megaphone
but
not
what
the
police
officer
said.
however,
his
statement
has
been
variously
testified
to
on
his
first
approach.
it
was
according
to
the
police
officers
who
heard
it,
simply
that
they
were
interfering
with
traffic.
by
this
time,
a
description
of
the
crowd
indicates
that
they
had
moved
forward
crowding
toward
the
speaker
as
quite
not
true.
this
is
a
noisy
place
at
that
hour.
and
had
overlapped
the
two
sidewalk
areas
on
either
side
of
the
statue,
12
feet
in
width
each
and
indeed
some
of
them
had
spilled
over
from
the
concrete
island
in
to
the
traffic
lanes
of
broadway
in
7th
avenue
that
bound
this
so-called
square.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
police
officer
who
made
the
statement,
captain
mcallister
did
not
testify
but
other
--
the
other
police
officer
who
had
the
recording
device
and
was
present
with
the
crowd
heard
what
he
said
and
testified
as
to
what
he
said.
the
defendants
variously
testified
as
to
what
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
--
he
testified
that
on
the
first
approach
he
said,
“you
are
interfering
with
vehicular
and
pedestrian
traffic,
no
direction
to
disband
simply
a
statement
of
that
nature.
according
to
the
defendant
he
said,
“you
are
not
permitted
to
have
this
meeting”
or
“where
did
you
get
permission
for
this
meeting?”
or
“we
do
not
allow
meetings
at
this
point”.
and
i
think
i
should
mention
at
this
time
that
the
petitioner
here
makes
a
statement
in
his
brief
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
police
officer
announced
that
there
was
a
ban
on
meetings
of
political
dissent
in
this
area.
there
is
absolutely
no
shred
of
evidence
in
anywhere
in
this
record
that
there
was
any
ban
on
meetings
on
political
dissent.
indeed,
there
is
no
indication
that
this
was
a
response
to
the
content
of
the
meeting
at
all.
although
there
is
testimony
that
there
were
placards
for
example
displayed
during
the
course
of
this
meeting,
there
is
no
testimony
in
this
record
as
to
what
was
on
the
placards,
what
they
said
or
whether
the
police
officers
perceived
them
or
reacted
to
them.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
new
york
police
department
has
a
bureau
which
is
called
the
bureau
of
special
services.
it
is
not
clear
from
this
record
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
infer
from
the
record
that
it
is
the
obligation
or
duty
of
these
specially
trained
police
officers
to
attend
meetings
of
groups
that
are
thought
to
be
possibly
hostile
or
dangerous
and
to
perceive
or
listen
to
what
it
--
what
is
stated
in
public
meetings.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
is
fair
to
infer,
yes
justice
fortas.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
officer
from
this
bureau
of
special
services
testified
that
he
had
recognized
and
was
familiar
with
the
faces
and
voices
of
the
leaders
of
this
particular
organization.
he
has
seen
them
on
previous
occasion.
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
not
--
it
was
not
from
the
bureau
of
special
services
that
the
ordinary
precinct
policemen
attended
this
meeting.
as
i
say,
it
was
announced
by
a
public
distribution
of
some
10,000
leaflets.
in
any
event
at
this
point,
no
other
policemen
were
on
the
scene
with
the
exception
of
captain
mcallister.
there
is
then
some
testimony
in
the
record
indicating
that
the
police
officers
attempted
to
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
i
say
justice
brennan,
it's
unclear.
the
estimates
vary
from
60
to
300.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
at
that
time.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
apparently,
the
group
did
not
change
in
size
although
during
this
period
a
number
of
onlookers
not
an
immediate
audience,
it
varies
really
--
estimated
at
several
thousand
gathered
on
the
opposite
sidewalk.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
presumably,
the
bullhorn
would
carry
though
not
distinctly
and
depending
on
the
variations
of
traffic
noise.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
certainly
happens
in
new
york,
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
this
is
the
12-ft
distance
to
the
curve
of
the
--
of
duffy
square.
the
front
of
the
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
immediate
audience
was
located
in
this
area
on
the
square.
roughly
it
covers
the
area
represented
by
the
subway
grade.
the
onlookers
while
their
position
was
not
described
with
clarity,
apparently
where
at
this
distance
on
this
side.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
in
new
york,
this
record
does
indicate
that
new
york
has
a
permit
requirement
for
the
use
of
a
bullhorn
and
that
was
prosecuted
jointly
with
this
trial
but
the
conviction
for
two
--
the
two
individuals
who
used
the
horn
for
using
it
without
a
permit
is
not
before
this
court
at
this
time.
there
is
apparently
also
some
requirement
for
a
permit
for
the
use
of
a
public
park
for
these
meetings.
now,
and
point
of
the
fact
this
duffy
square
is
technically
a
public
park,
however,
there
was
no
proof
in
this
record
to
that
effect
and
indeed
they
were
not
prosecuted
for
having
use
a
public
park
without
a
permit.
the
permit
requirement
by
the
way
in
new
york
is
an
automatic
one,
the
law
requires
that
on
application
a
permit
shall
issue.
so
there
is
no
discretionary
issue
there.
in
any
event,
the
crowd
was
completely
orderly
at
this
time
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
certain
individuals
had
spilled
over
into
street.
now,
the
police
officers
tried
to
move
them
back
and
they
tried
to
open
a
path
along
the
sidewalk
but
found
that
they
were
unable
to
do
so.
at
this
point,
there
was
a
second
approach
and
under
--
the
second
approach
apparently
repeated
the
injunction
that
they
were
obstructing
vehicular
traffic,
pedestrian
traffic
and
in
addition,
the
police
officer
said,
“you'll
have
to
disband
the
meeting”.
now,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
was
a
reaction
to
the
situation
as
it
developed
or
the
result
of
a
predetermined
plan
by
the
police
officer
was
raised
and
indeed,
the
counsel
--
trial
counsel
tried
to
establish
that
there
was
some
sort
of
ban.
they
say
the
record
is
not
altogether
clear
as
to
whether
there
was
a
ban
and
if
there
was
a
ban,
who
had
directed
it
or
what
the
nature
of
it
was.
but
on
the
record
on
which
these
individuals
were
convicted,
there
is
only
the
faintest
hint
of
any
such
ban
and
if
indeed
there
was
a
ban,
it
was
simply
a
ban
on
meetings
of
any
sort
in
this
area.
now,
there
was
a
question
yesterday,
i
believe,
directed
to
mr.
fraenkel
as
to
whether
or
not
there
hadn't
been
some
evidence
that
a
police
officer
had
offered
alternative
site
to
these
individuals.
now,
mr.
fraenkel,
in
answering
in
a
negative
overlooked
the
testimony
of
one
of
his
own
witnesses
who
testified
that
police
officer
when
he
first
came
up
to
the
leader
of
the
group
said,
“why
don't
you
hold
your
meeting
south
of
48th
street
or
north
of
59th
street?”
now,
that
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
that's
on
page
200.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
200
of
the
record.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
the
sum
and
substance
of
it.
there
was
no
evidence
for
example
that
there
was
any
disorder
of
a
violent
or
threatening
type
and
there
was
certainly
no
evidence
that
the
police
were
reacting
to
the
content
of
what
was
being
said.
indeed,
there
was
not
very
much
that
have
been
said.
i
think
that
the
record
as
it
reproduces
the
tape
recording
of
what
the
speakers
had
said
will
indicate
one
sentence
only
on
the
content
and
that
was
something
along
the
lines
that
the
american
policy
in
vietnam
was
ill
advised.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
record
photograph
--
the
photograph
of
the
square,
i
think,
dramatically
reveals
what
the
usual
use
of
it
is.
there
are
two
bus
stops,
there
are
benches,
there
are
some
foliage,
there
are
crosswalks
on
either
end,
and
north
to
south
sidewalk
running
on
lawn.
it
is
as
you
can
see
simply
a
traffic
dividing
the
island
in
point
of
fact
and
its
customary
use
is
simply
that
which
is
disclosed
by
the
photograph.
now,
i
should
say
that
there
were
efforts
made
by
counsel
at
the
trial
to
establish
that
there
had
been
other
demonstrations
at
other
times
or
other
meetings
or
rallies
held
in
the
time
square
area.
the
trial
judge
excluded
this
evidence
on
the
grounds
of
irrelevancy.
it
was
not
really
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
area
or
any
other
part
of
times
square
were
used
for
bon
rallies
or
new
year's
eve
celebrations,
it
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
group
was
too
large
to
be
comfortably
contained
within
this
island
that
without
presenting
an
interference
to
the
flow
of
vehicular
traffic
which
is
considerable
and
the
passage
of
pedestrians
using
the
sidewalks.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
only
know
what
the
record
reveals
justice
stewart
on
that
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
distribution
of
10,000
leaflets
inviting
people
to
a
rally
protesting
the
war
in
vietnam
at
duffy
square,
4
o'clock
and
that's
apparently
the
only
matter
and
which
are
cited
to
our
brief.
there
was
a
testimony
by
a
newspaper
reporter
for
example
that
he
got
one
of
those
fliers
or
announcements
on
the
city
desk
in
the
usual
course,
i
mean,
which
newspapers
get
these
announcements.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
precisely
correct,
justice
fortas.
we
--
we
--
there
is
no
contention
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
this
anymore
than
any
other
sidewalk
meeting
as
in
shuttlesworth
or
anything
of
that
sort.
our
--
our
only
contention
is
that
as
this
meeting
developed
it
was
too
large
for
the
place
and
the
police
reacted
to
that.
apparently
what
happened
was
that
after
this
failure
and
attempt
to
get
people
back
on
the
sidewalk,
there
were
some
testimony
that
automobiles
coming
at
--
from
south
of
the
avenue
had
to
veer
to
avoid
pedestrians
in
the
street,
that
people
using
the
bus
stops
and
so
on
had
to
walk
in
the
roadway
and
so
on.
there
must
have
been
a
gesture
or
signal
or
some
communication
because
at
that
point,
some
12
to
15
blue
coded
patrolman
and
two
mounted
patrolman
appeared.
where
they
have
geared
from
is
not
altogether
clear,
whether
they
were
waiting
or
--
or
where
they're
waiting
is
not
clear.
one
of
the
defendants
testified
that
that
they
appeared
from
behind
the
statue
in
this
area.
and
at
that
point,
they
started
to
disperse
the
crowd.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
correct,
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
i
presume
so,
whether
they
actually
held
of
not
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
does
at
the
present
time
and
i
think
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
at
that
time,
it
did
on
--
on
one
avenue
and
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
i
--
i
think
it
might
have
been
at
that
time
one-way
traffic
on
both
stops.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
bus
stop
would
indicate
that
there
was
south-going
traffic
only
on
7th
avenue
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
believe
broadway
has
been
one-way
for
some
time.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
south
going,
yes
sir.
there
had
been
or
some
--
i
can
--
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
we
--
we
in
new
york
have
observed
in
this
general
area
certain
kinds
of
demonstrations
and
protests
that
have
proceeded
without
any
interference.
i'm
thinking
of
one
which
was
a
silent
vigil
so-called
which
pickets
stood
with
signs
around
the
area,
not
a
meeting,
but
stood
with
protest
signs
for
some
period
of
time
around
the
times
square
area,
without
any
interference.
in
any
event,
the
--
i
think
one
of
the
clearest
indications
in
this
record
that
there
was
no
reaction
by
the
police
to
the
content
or
substance
of
what
was
being
said,
was
the
fact
that
the
chairman
of
this
meeting
and
the
organizer,
luce,
was
never
arrested.
the
only
people
who
were
arrested
in
this
case
were
those
who
fail
to
heed
the
police
order
to
disperse.
now,
under
subdivision
3
of
our
disorderly
conduct
statute,
it
is
a
disorderly
conduct
to
refuse
a
police
order
to
move
on.
that
statute
has
been
construed
by
the
new
york
state
court
in
a
limited
fashion.
it
is
only
the
reasonable
order
by
the
police
and
the
substantial
purpose
of
the
order
which
constitutes
the
offense.
in
other
words,
an
order
which
is
without
foundation
or
based
upon
whim,
can
be
disobeyed
without
a
violation
of
that
disorderly
conduct
provision.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
it
does.
they
refused
in
various
ways.
this
is
the
part
of
course
in
the
case
that
mr.
fraenkel
makes
his
point
on.
some
of
them
refused
by
lying
down,
some
by
sitting
down,
some
by
striking
police
officers,
biting
them,
one
by
striking
a
police
horse
with
a
rolled
up
placard,
others
by
just
simply
refusing,
and
indeed
responding
to
the
police
request
to
move
with
such
shouted
the
joiners
as
factious
police
could
stop
all,
“you
have
no
right,
we
have
rights”,
and
so
on.
but
each
of
the
defendants
who
is
arrested
in
this
case
was
one
who
in
someway
or
another
refused
to
heed
the
police
order
which
have
been
repeated
not
only
by
the
police
officer
who
first
made
the
direction
but
by
the
individual
officers
who
made
the
arrest.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
17
i
believe.
well,
there's
17
convictions,
justice
harlan.
i
am
not
quite
sure
how
many
were
arrested.
there
may
have
been
some
that
were
dismissed
before.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
jail
sentences,
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
estimates
are
that
there
were
between
12
and
15
on
foot
and
two
on
horseback.
this
was
at
about
25
minutes
after
four.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
time
specified
in
the
complaint.
they
were
charged
in
this
complaint
with
three
--
aside
from
the
administrative
code
violations
for
the
use
of
the
megaphone,
with
three
--
violation
of
three
subdivisions
of
the
disorderly
conduct
statute.
this
is
set
forth
in
the
complaint,
subdivisions
2,
3,
and
4.
3
as
i've
indicated
is
the
one
which
is
failure
to
move
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
serious
dispute
with
the
conviction
there.
these
were
in
the
alternative.
that
is
to
say
this
was
not
a
disjunctive
charge,
and
the
conviction,
the
general
verdict
of
the
court
guilty
i
think
should
be
fairly
construed
and
this
distinguishes
that
case
from
stromberg
cited
by
my
adversary
as
a
conjunctive
charges
to
say,
if
this
conviction
can
be
sustained
under
any
one
these
subdivisions,
then
there
is
no
need
to
reverse
the
conviction
based
on
the
general
verdict
of
guilty
as
charged.
there
was
as
i
say
no
disorder
until
the
order
of
the
police
to
move
on.
now,
one
of
these
subdivisions,
subdivision
2
charges
the
defendants
with
creating
a
disturbance,
tending
to
breach
the
peace,
annoying
to
others.
that
is
the
language
of
subdivision
2.
and
indeed
it
is
that
conviction
which
is
principally
challenged
by
my
adversary.
he
claims
that
the
complaint
does
not
charge
that
particular
offense
and
consequently
any
conviction
based
upon
evidence
as
to
what
--
of
what
occurred
after
the
order
to
disperse
in
not
fairly
charged
in
the
complaint
and
therefore
violation
of
due
process.
the
complaint
appears
itself
on
page
1
of
the
record
and
i
think
in
a
fair
reading
of
it
and
then
by
the
way
i
do
think
that
it
should
be
read
fairly.
it
is
a
--
an
affidavit
by
a
police
officer
and
should
be
construed
in
harmony
with
the
ventresco
principle
indicates
that
not
only
were
each
of
the
subdivisions
specified
in
that
complaint,
but
the
language
of
the
complaint
has
one
phrase
at
least
dealing
with
each
of
them.
for
example,
did
unlawfully
congregate
and
assemble
in
the
area
obstructing
the
area
to
the
exclusion
of
those
wishing
to
use
the
same
would
indicate
the
reasonableness
of
the
police
order
to
move
on.
as
to
the
subdivision
3,
the
last
phrase
says
when
ordered
to
move
on,
the
defendants
did
fail
to
do
so.
that
is
the
substance
of
subdivision
3.
subdivision
2,
the
one
that
my
adversary
claims
was
not
properly
charged,
i
think
is
implicit
in
the
phrase,
“did
delay
vehicular
traffic
while
carrying
placards
and
using
loud
and
boisterous
language”.
and
the
only
allegation
of
loud
and
boisterous
language
was
the
loud
and
boisterous
language
used
by
the
defendants
after
the
order
to
move
on.
so
that
i
say
that
not
--
these
are
not
mutually
dependent
subsections.
in
other
words,
even
as
the
police
ordered
to
move
on
was
not
a
reasonable
order
and
of
course
the
new
york
courts
construed
it
as
such.
the
reaction
of
the
defendants
so
far
exceeded
the
proper
resistance
to
such
an
unlawful
order,
that
it
in
itself
became
a
disorderly
conduct.
in
other
words,
although
you
are
entitled
to
resist
an
unlawful
order
under
the
new
york
law
and
not
move
on
when
told
unreasonably
to
do
so,
you
cannot
resist
it
in
such
a
loud
and
boisterous
manner
as
to
create
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
disturbance
and
annoyance
to
others.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct
sir.
they're
quite
independent.
they're
quite
independent,
even
though
as
i
say
the
actions
in
this
case
constituting
the
violation
of
subdivision
2
occurred
in
point
of
time
after
the
order.
the
court
--
the
only
court
that
wrote
an
opinion
in
this
case
was
the
appellate
term,
the
court
of
first
review.
and
that
court
in
a
long
opinion
found
that
implicit
in
this
complaint
was
the
charge
of
the
actions
occurring
after
the
order
to
disperse
because
it
was
charged
that
the
defendants
failed
to
move
on
when
directed
to
do
so.
that
is
really
i
think
the
principal
point
which
is
being
made
by
my
adversary,
one
of
pleading.
i
do
not
think
that
he
can
seriously
contend
that
there
was
in
this
instance
any
reaction
so
long
condemned
by
this
court
to
the
content
of
the
speech
or
an
attempt
to
break
up
the
meeting
because
the
views
being
expressed
were
unpopular
with
the
police
or
with
the
society
the
police
represent.
this
is
indeed,
i
think,
a
pure
instance
of
the
type
of
situation
which
this
court
i
believe
has
in
an
unbroken
line
of
authority
and
virtually
every
member
of
the
court
who
has
written
on
this
subject
has
agreed
is
a
proper
police
function.
and
that
is
that
the
police
have
the
right
to
regulate
the
manner
of
expression
of
speech
consistent
with
the
interests
of
society
in
maintaining
free
thoroughfare
and
the
free
use
of
the
streets
to
those
wishing
to
engage
in
ordinary
commerce.
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
at
this
point
that
such
regulation
of
the
manner,
time,
and
place
are
expression
of
ideas
or
assembling
does
not
constitute
any
first
amendment
infringement.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
there
is
actually
one
division
of
subdivision
of
722
of
disorderly
conduct
does
subdivision
4.
one
of
those
that
the
defendants
was
convicted
of
states
that
anyone
who
by
his
actions,
tending
to
breach
the
peace,
causes
the
crowd
to
collect
other
than
while
lawfully
addressing
a
crowd
is
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct.
now,
that
subdivision
4
may
be
still
in
this
case
and
it
may
not
be.
it
was
never
considered
by
any
of
the
lower
courts
writing
on
it
--
on
this
case.
and
indeed
it
has
not
been
construed
by
our
highest
court.
so
we
have
not
relied
on
that
statute
nor
has
the
defendant
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
on
its
face.
that
is
the
only
statute
that
makes
any
specific
reference
to
an
address
to
a
public
assembly.
in
this
instance,
new
york
by
--
by
statute
does
leave
to
the
police
the
discretion
to
decide
when
there
has
been
an
interference
with
vehicular
traffic
and
that
discretion
is
reviewable
under
the
new
york
construction
of
722
that
his
judgment
must
be
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
consequently,
the
statute
on
its
face
must
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
construing
sections
to
limit
this
discretion
to
a
reasonable
order.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
as
applied
in
this
instance,
we
have
a
clear
example
of
a
reasonable
order
in
the
interest
of
vehicular
and
pedestrian
free
passage
of
where
the
police
simply
tried
to
convey
and
contain
the
group
and
when
they
fail
to
do
so,
to
disperse
the
group
which
was
a
traffic
menace,
and
did
so
without
any
regard
to
the
content
or
substance
of
abuse
that
were
being
expressed,
unlike
the
feiner
case.
i
think
that
element
is
out
of
this
case
altogether.
thank
you.
