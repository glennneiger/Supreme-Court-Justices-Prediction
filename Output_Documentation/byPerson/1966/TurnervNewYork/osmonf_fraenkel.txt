mr.
osmonf
fraenkel
just
a
few
brief
remarks.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
mr.
uviller
is
incorrect
when
he
states
that
when
the
police
captain
and
the
inspector
for
the
first
time
approach
the
speakers,
they
did
not
order
the
meeting
to
disperse,
that
only
police
officer
who
testified
clearly
on
that
subject
was
officer
bear
and
at
page
9
of
the
record,
he
says,
“are
you
giving
your
best
to
the
court?
are
you
giving
your
best
recollection,
the
substance
of
what
was
said
by
the
witness
as
correct?”
and
then
an
objection
was
overruled
and
then
the
witness
continued.
that
in
view
of
this
interference
with
pedestrian
and
the
vehicular
traffic,
that
the
meeting
would
have
to
be
terminated
at
this
location
at
this
time.
so
that
was
an
order
to
terminate
the
meeting.
now,
that
happened
about
two
minutes
after
the
meeting
started
as
the
court
will
see,
as
the
court
reads
to
itself
aloud
the
recording
which
is
in
the
record.
moreover,
i
think
mr.
uviller
--
mr.
osmonf
fraenkel
oh,
he
said
the
first
time
that
the
police
captain
said,
“he
merely
talked
about
vehicular
interference”,
but
did
not
tell
him
to
stop
the
meeting.
but
he
didn't
do
that
until
he
approach
them
the
second
time.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
police
officer
testified
that
the
first
time
he
approached
them,
he
told
them
the
meeting
would
have
to
stop,
now
that's
an
--
mr.
osmonf
fraenkel
oh
yes
--
find
that
it's
opposite
(voice
overlap)
according
to
this
officer.
now
according
to
the
--
disinterested
witness,
mr.
lutherfield
he
did
not
mentioned
vehicular
traffic.
now,
it
is
also
i
think
erroneous
to
say
that
the
police
had
tried
to
get
to
people
off
--
the
few
people
who
were
on
the
roadway
off
it,
because
two
police
officers
were
specifically
questioned
on
that
subject,
whether
they
made
any
attempt
to
get
to
go
back
on
the
sidewalk
and
then
both
said
no.
now,
one
other
thing,
we
are
not
claiming
only
that
certain
of
these
subdivisions
should
be
disregarded.
we
are
claiming
basically
and
that's
my
first
--
my
humble
judgment,
my
main
point
in
this
case
that
this
complaint
did
not
indicate
that
there
was
any
intention
of
charging
these
people
with
the
acts
which
i
can
conceded
yesterday
were
to
some
extent
unlawful
in
resisting
the
order
to
disperse
because
the
whole
complaint
proceeds
on
the
basis
that
the
police
officers
had
told
them
to
stop
because
the
meeting
was
unlawful.
and
our
contention
basically
is
that
the
meeting
up
to
that
point
was
not
unlawful.
and
that
if
there
was
any
desire
to
prosecute
any
of
these
individuals
for
the
wrongful
things
they
did
afterward,
they
should
have
been
separately
prosecuted
for
those
because
that
was
not
a
joint
venture
or
a
joint
effort.
it
was
the
reaction
of
the
separate
individuals
according
to
their
own
temperaments
to
the
situation
that
existed.
so
it
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
pleading
in
technical
sense.
it's
a
matter
of
the
fair
intendment
of
a
complaint
putting
the
people
unnoticed
of
what
they
were
being
charged
with.
and
here,
we
submit,
they
were
charged
in
the
holding
on
an
unlawful
meeting
and
there
was
at
that
time
no
unlawful
meeting
because
we
insist
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
of
interference
with
traffic
up
to
that
point.
the
real
interference
of
this
traffic
came
afterward
when
the
meeting
spread
out,
people
ran
all
over,
the
cars
stopped.
up
to
that
point,
all
that
happened
was
that
a
few
people
were
in
the
roadway
and
that
some
cars
had
to
move
to
avoid
those
few
people.
now,
that's
something
that
happens
in
new
york
all
the
time.
people
cross
the
streets,
cars
have
to
swerve
to
avoid
the
people
crossing
the
street.
that's
not
an
interference
with
traffic
in
any
sense.
it
justifies
in
my
opinion
the
ending
of
a
lawful
meeting.
thank
you.
