mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
not
able
to
see
respondent's
brief
until
late
monday
because
i
had
been
out
of
the
country
for
some
weeks
and
i
therefore
prepared
a
xerox,
a
very
short
reply
brief
dealing
with
one
point
in
respondent's
brief
which
i
would
like
to
submit
and
will
replace
by
a
printed
brief
in
the
requisite
number
of
copies
and
so
on
when
i
get
back
to
new
york
tomorrow
or
friday.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
have
given
my
advisory
a
copy.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
this
is
on
appeal
rather
by
certiorari
here
from
conviction
of
a
group
of
individuals
in
the
criminal
court
of
the
city
of
new
york,
convictions
which
where
affirmed
by
the
appropriate
appellant
court
and
then
reviewed
by
new
york's
highest
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
affirmed
without
opinion,
but
with
an
amendment
to
the
remitted
toward
indicating
the
constitutional
issues
had
been
raised
which
are
the
precise
constitutional
issues
referred
to
in
the
petition.
the
case
arose
as
a
result
of
the
meeting
held
in
an
area
just
north
of
times
square
in
new
york
city
known
as
duffy
square,
which
is
a
triangular
area
between
broadway
and
7th
avenue
and
this
was
a
meeting
protesting
the
vietnam
war
and
it
began
around
4
o'clock
on
a
certain
afternoon
in
summer
time.
the
testimony
is
somewhat
in
conflict
which
i
will
develop
later,
but
before
i
get
to
the
testimony
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
hear
exactly
what
the
complaint
contained,
because
my
first
contention
is
that
these
petitioners
were
convicted
for
things
not
specified
in
the
complaint.
that
conviction
therefore
cannot
stand
being
a
denial
of
due
process
under
de
jonge
against
oregon,
cole
against
arkansas,
thomson
against
louisiana,
and
garner
against
--
now
the
complaint
says
this.
at
4:25
pm
on
august
8,
1964,
vicinity
duffy
square,
47th
street
and
broadway
the
defendants
did
unlawfully
congregate
and
assembled
at
the
above
location
obstructing
the
area
to
the
exclusion
of
those
wishing
to
use
the
same
and
did
delay
vehicular
traffic
while
carrying
placards
and
using
loud
and
boisterous
language;
by
their
actions
did
cause
a
crowd
to
collect.
when
ordered
to
move
on
the
defendants
did
fail
to
do
so,
after
being
informed
that
their
actions
were
not
lawful
and
the
references
of
course
to
the
new
york
disorderly
conduct
statute,
appeal
law
section
722
specifically
to
sections
2,
3
and
4
to
which
i
will
come
later.
now
it
was
the
defense's
contention
at
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
oh
yes.
it
was
the
defendant's
contention
at
the
trial,
it
is
that
contention
all
the
way
up
at
here
that
this
complaint
charged
them
with
holding
an
unlawful
meeting
which
the
police
had
a
right
to
disperse
because
the
meeting
was
unlawful
in
the
respects
indicated.
whereas
at
the
trial
there
was
testimony
produced
over
objection
by
the
defense
specifically
on
that
ground.
from
various
acts
committed
by
most
of
these
petitioners
although
curiously
enough
not
all,
which
occurred
after
the
order
to
disperse,
beyond
the
mere
allegation
of
the
complaint
that
they
refused
to
move
on,
act
such
as
two
of
them
lying
down
on
the
street.
one
of
them
hit
a
policeman's
horse,
others
running
around
and
interfering
with
the
police's
attempts
to
break
up
the
meeting,
various
acts
which
was
stressed
in
the
appealing
of
the
appellant
term
affirming
the
convictions
as
justifying
them.
now
our
view
is
that
except
for
the
failure
to
move
on,
nothing
which
happened
after
the
order
to
disperse
is
relevant
to
this
particular
complaint
which
rests
on
the
proposition
that
before
there
was
an
order
to
move
on,
there
was
an
unlawful
assemblage.
we
submit
that
therefore
the
convictions
cannot
stand
because
in
the
first
place
no
one
can
tell
from
this
record
whether
these
petitioners
were
convicted
because
there
was
an
unlawful
meeting
before
the
order
to
disperse
or
because
of
unlawful
conduct
afterwards.
the
trial
court
wrote
no
opinion
in
finding
all
of
the
defendants
guilty,
although
some
distinction
was
made
in
the
sentence,
three
of
them
were
fined
$25
and
the
others
were
fined
with
suspended
sentences.
but
the
appellant
term
expressly
relied
on
these
subsequent
events
as
justifying
the
convictions
and
so
does
my
opponent
in
his
brief
here.
now
he
says
that
the
complaint
is
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
which
he
gives
to
it
and
which
the
appellant
term
gave
to
it,
because
of
the
reference
in
the
beginning
of
the
complaint
to
this
time
of
4:25
pm,
to
which
i
say
two
things.
in
the
first
place
these
defendants
were
not
operating
at
that
meeting
with
stop
watches
in
their
hands
so
that
they
would
know
at
what
time
of
the
meeting
4:25
arose,
but
in
the
second
place
and
this
i
consider
to
be
basic
and
this
what
is
discussed
in
my
brief
reply,
under
new
york
law,
well
settled
law
as
decided
by
our
court
of
appeals,
the
time
mentioned
in
a
charge
is
of
no
relevant
and
whatever,
except
in
those
rare
cases
where
it
might
have
some
relevance
as
to
whether
an
offense
is
committed
in
the
day
time
or
at
night,
but
otherwise
it's
no
relevant
whatever
and
the
prosecution
is
in
no
way
bound
by
it,
but
can
prove
the
offenses
occurring
at
any
time.
so
that
the
reference
to
4:25
we
submit
gave
no
notice
or
warning
to
these
defendants
that
they
were
going
to
be
charged
with
things
that
occurred
after
the
order
to
disperse
even
if
any
of
them
had
been
conscious
of
the
fact
that
order
was
given
before
4:25.
now
here
is
what
the
testimony
showed.
and
i
should
point
out
that
there
were
three
classes
of
witness
at
this
trial;
police
officers,
defendants,
and
a
reporter
for
the
new
york
times,
a
man
by
the
name
of
joseph
lelyveld
who
is
by
line
members
of
this
court
may
have
seen
in
the
times
in
recent
months.
he
was
there
in
his
capacity
as
a
reporter.
he
is
only
therefore
disinterested
person
in
our
view.
now
the
testimony
was
that
almost
immediately
after
the
meeting
began
and
some
words
were
stated,
a
police
captain
and
inspector
came
up
to
the
person
holding
the
meeting
and
told
him
the
meeting
had
to
disperse.
neither
the
captain
nor
the
police
inspector
testified
at
this
trial.
what
they
said
was
testified
to
differently
by
the
different
groups
of
people.
one
and
only
one
police
officer
said
that
he
heard
the
captain
talk
about
obstruction
of
traffic.
the
reporter
from
the
times
said
nothing
was
said
about
obstruction
of
traffic
and
that
was
supported
by
the
defendants.
there
is
another
significant
element
to
this.
this
police
officer
had
a
tape
recording
of
what
was
said
by
the
speaker
at
the
meeting.
that
tape
recording
for
some
unexplained
reason
did
not
contain
anything
said
by
the
police
captain
when
approaching
the
speakers,
but
it
did
contain
what
the
speakers
said
immediately
in
response,
which
was
that
they
considered
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
hold
a
peaceable
meeting
and
that
was
the
whole
thrust
of
the
discussion
insofar
as
it
appeared.
now
up
to
that
point
the
evidence
of
the
times
reporter
was
the
meeting
was
orderly,
no
excitement,
no
undue
noise,
there
were
perhaps
60
or
70
people
present.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
your
honor,
there
is
a
photograph
of
it
in
the
record
i
don't
know
that
the
exact
size
with
specify,
do
we
have
the
exact
size?
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
there
is
a
--
mr.
(inaudible)
has
given
me.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
would
say
its
looks
to
be
about
30
feet
wide
at
its
widest
and
â€“
you
haven't
got
the
dimensions
and
the
length?
i
would
guess
about
150
feet.
it
occupies
roughly
two
blocks,
between
45th
and
47th
street
with
a
triangular
shape
in
between
them.
now
the
only
evidence
prior
to
the
order
to
disperse
with
respect
to
possible
justification
was
the
evidence
of
one
policeman,
but
there
had
been
some
overflow
of
people
from
these
paved
area
raised
above
the
street,
on
to
the
street
itself
and
that
some
cars
had
to
swerve
to
avoid
these
people
who
were
there.
but
he
testified
that
he
had
not
ordered
the
people
to
go
back
on
to
the,
what
would
be
called
the
sidewalk
of
the
square.
here
is
the
enlarged
duffy
square.
this
was
not
in
the
record
but
i
have
no
objection
of
it
being
considered
by
the
court.
so
that
our
contention
is
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
whatever
in
this
record
justifying
the
original
order
to
disperse.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
this
began
around
4
o'clock.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
was
it
a
saturday?
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
was
a
saturday
afternoon.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
august.
now
it
is
true
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
that,
there's
some
questions
about
it.
mr.
lelyveld
testified
they
were
about
60
odd
people
in
the
meeting.
the
police
officer
said
they
were
about
200.
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
about
thousands
of
people
walking
along
on
the
sidewalks,
would
be
these
sidewalks
you
see
the
normal
sidewalks
on
which
people
travel
in
that
area
all
the
time,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
prior
to
the
order
to
disperse
a
crowd
collected,
that
any
relation
to
the
meeting
other
than
people
who
were
at
the
meeting
themselves.
no
evidence
that
these
people
wandering
along
the
sidewalk
where
in
anyway
disturbed
or
affected
by
anything
which
occurred
at
the
meeting.
now
there
is
evidence
that
after
the
order
to
disperse,
at
least
i
should
point
out
that
the
first
order
to
disperse
was
followed
by
these
remarks
of
the
speaker
that
they
had
a
right
to
continue
to
hold
the
meeting
and
then
came
almost
immediately
a
second
order
to
disperse.
somewhere
in
respondent's
briefs
there
is
mention
of
a
half
hour
interval,
but
there
is
no
such
testimony
in
the
record,
the
times
are
not
given
specifically
clearly
enough.
but
in
any
case
there
is
no
doubt
that
after
the
second
order
to
disperse,
certain
amount
of
disorder
resulted
and
had
some
of
these
individuals
been
prosecuted
specifically
what
that
kind
of
disorder
as
the
two
persons
who
were
charged
with
having
laying
down
on
the
sidewalk,
or
the
one
who
claimed
--is
charged
with
having
hit
a
horse,
a
policeman's
horse
although
his
testimony
was
that
he
hit
that
horse
because
the
horse
was
about
to
trample
on
somebody
who
had
fallen
near
it
and
he
wanted
to
divert
the
horse.
so
i
say
had
they
been
specifically
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
of
that
kind,
the
issues
before
this
court
would
be
all
together
different.
i
doubt
whether
the
case
would
be
here
before
this
court
but
in
it's
present
posture
we
contend
first
as
i
have
said,
that
this
complaint
did
not
justify
use
of
any
of
the
evidence
as
to
what
could
be
called
disorderly
acts
of
the
persons
after
the
order
to
disperse
other
than
their
mere
failure
to
obey
that
order
and
that,
that
failure
was
not
constitutionally,
is
the
subject
of
a
charge,
because
the
police
at
that
stage
had
no
justification
for
giving
the
order,
but
in
any
case
because
of
the
way
in
which
this
case
was
decided
both
below
and
in
the
appellate
court,
no
one
can
determine
on
which
basis
the
convictions
rested,
so
that
the
cases
somewhat
like
that
of
an
improper
charge
to
a
jury
such
as
was
condemned
many,
many
years
ago
for
instance
in
the
california
red
flag
case,
the
stromberg
case.
and
therefore
what
is
involved
here,
is
an
interference
with
a
lawful
meeting
held
for
a
lawful
purpose
of
speech,
to
be
sure
the
speech
in
connection
with
an
unpopular
cause
and
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
which
in
my
judgment
justifies
the
inference
that
it
was
the
unpopularity
of
the
subject
of
the
meeting
which
induced
the
original
order
to
disperse.
the
testimony
is
that
the
officer
told
the
people
in
charge
of
the
meeting
that
they
had
no
rights
to
conduct
the
meeting,
not
that
he
told
them
that
they
were
obstructing
traffic.
now
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
i
don't
know
of
any
such
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
was
an
offer
of
proof,
that
other
meetings
had
been
held
in
this
area
and
that
was
rejected
by
the
trial
court.
it's
not
a
place
like
union
square
which
has
a
traditional
character
or
used
to
have
because
i
think
they
are
fewer
now
than
there
used
to
be,
but
in
any
event
speak
meetings
in
new
york
or
not
unusual
(inaudible)
and
as
i
say
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
to
show
that
meetings
had
been
held
there
in
connection
with
bond
rallies
and
some
other
subjects.
now
whether
that
offer
of
proof
could
have
been
sustained
we
can't
know,
but
it
was
rejected.
now
we
content
further
in
this
case
that
the
statute
as
here
applied
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
now
here
is
what
the
statute
says.
subdivision
2;
acts
in
such
a
manner
as
to
annoy,
disturb,
interfere
with,
obstruct
or
be
offensive
to
others.
subdivision
3;
congregates
with
others
on
a
public
street
and
refuses
to
move
on
when
ordered
by
the
police.
subdivision
4;
by
his
actions
causes
a
crowd
to
collect
except
when
lawfully
addressing
such
a
crowd.
now
as
to
the
first,
we
submit
that
as
to
what
constitutes
an
appearance
or
being
offensive
is
very
vague
and
in
fact
the
appellant
term
itself
recognized
that
i
thought
that
it
was
overcome
by
the
acts
which
occurred
subsequent
to
the
order
to
disperse.
but
we
submit
that
there
has
been
no
sufficiently
definite
definition
of
that
provision
and
that
the
final
case
on
which
reliance
was
placed
in
the
court,
in
the
appellant
term
by
my
opponent
does
not
support
the
convictions
in
these
cases
--
in
this
case.
as
this
court
will
recall,
finer
(ph)
was
convicted
because
he
made
a
speech
on
the
streets
of,
i
think
it
was
syracuse
or
rochester,
in
which
he
in
effect
urged
negroes
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
and
the
police
told
him
to
stop
because
the
people
around
where
getting
arrested
and
one
of
them
had
indicated
some
resentment
and
the
police
feared
that
there
would
be
some
kind
of
a
disturbance
resulting
from
these
inflammatory
remarks.
this
court,
although
divided
court,
upheld
that
conviction.
now
here
of
course
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind.
they
were
no
inflammatory
remarks.
no
one
urged
to
do
anything
improper.
there
was
no
resentment
from
anyone
listening.
there
was
therefore
no
basis
for
the
police
believing
that
any
unlawful
conduct
would
result
from
the
continuation
of
this
meeting.
now
the
second
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
of
course
the
use
of
the
word
they,
don't
forget
your
honor,
mr.
justice
there
were
17
people
charged
here
jointly.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
joint
unlawful
conduct,
none
whatsoever.
had
there
been
any
reference
to
these
specific
wrong
doings
in
the
complaint
that
it
would
have
been
appropriate
for
the
defendants
to
try
to
get
severance,
so
different
people
charged
with
the
different
kind
of
things
would
receive
discreet
treatment.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
am
talking
the
time
of
the
order
to
disperse
the
meeting.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
after
all
until
there
was
an
order
to
disperse
there
was
no
reason
for
dispersing
and
the
order
can
be
justified
only
by
what
occurred
prior
to
the
order
not
by
what
occurred
afterwards.
this
is
the
reverse
of
the
search
and
cease
situation
where
the
search
can
be
justified
by
what's
found
afterwards,
but
not
by
what
was
found
before.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
not
everybody.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
no
that's
not
strictly
accurate
because
at
least
three
of
these
petitioners
were
never
charged
with
by
any
witness
with
having
done
anything
and
the
appellant
term
in
its
opinion
so
recognizes.
they
were
simply
important
people
in
connection
with
the
meeting,
but
it's
true
that
most
of
the
people
arrested
were
by
testimony
connected
with
some
act
which
had
it
been
separately
charged
as
a
separate
act
and
no
merely
as
a
failure
to
move
on
when
ordered
to
break
up
a
peaceful
meeting.
what
if
just
they
found
true,
would
have
justified
a
conviction
and
as
i
said
before
wouldn't
have
come
to
this
court.
now
we
come
then
to
the
next
subdivision,
the
congregation
with
others
on
a
public
street,
refuse
to
move
on
when
ordered
by
the
police
well
that's
obviously
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
not
every
order
by
a
policeman,
because
people
have
congregated
two
or
three
people
talk
together
can
be
justified
particularly
not
when
a
meeting
is
being
held
to
discuss
some
matter
of
public
importance
and
therefore
we
can't
suppose
that
the
conviction
rested
on
this.
and
finally
we
have
the
vary
vague
ambiguous
provision,
by
his
action
causes
a
crowd
to
collect
to
except
when
lawfully
addressing
such
a
crowd,
well
that's
what
we
contend
happened
here,
he
was
lawfully
addressing
such
a
crowd
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
which
suggests
what
constitutes
lawfully
addressing
a
crowd
and
what
doesn't
constitute
lawfully
addressing
a
crowd
and
there
are
no
standards
whatsoever
in
this
statute.
so
that
we
contend
first
that
the
complaint
restricted
the
charge
to
what
occurred
prior
to
the
order
to
disperse.
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
that
anything
which
occurred
prior
to
the
order
to
disperse
justified
that
order.
and
that
therefore
the
order
was
unconstitutional
as
an
interference
with
freedom
of
expression
along
the
lines
of
many
cases
which
this
court
has
recently
decided
which
i
have
cited
on
my
brief,
which
have
taken
the
general
view
that
a
broad
disorderly
conduct
statute
cannot
be
made
the
basis
for
interference
with
free
expression.
that
if
there
are
particular
circumstances
or
places
where
such
expression
is
improper
or
inappropriate
then
legislation
should
be
wise
dealing
with
such
situations
so
that
people
generally
maybe
advised
of
what
their
rights
are,
but
that
the
broad
catch
all,
this
orderly
conduct
charge
is
inappropriate
to
deal
with
such
matters.
finally
we
contend
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
justifying
these
convictions
because
nobody
can
determine
from
this
record
whether
they
arrested
on
the
police
or
the
trier
of
the
facts,
that
the
meeting
was
unlawful
and
therefore
the
police
had
to
right
to
break
it
up
or
whether
the
convictions
rested
on
the
police
or
the
trier
of
the
facts
that
what
occurred
after
the
order
to
disperse
justified
the
conviction.
and
in
that
state
of
doubt
we
submit
there
can
be
no
convictions
because
there
can
be
no
proper
basis
for
appellate
review
and
as
i
said
just
a
moment
ago
we
also
claim
that
as
here
applied
these
three
provisions
of
the
law
under
which
the
convictions
--
on
which
the
convictions
rested
are
unconstitutionally
vague
at
least
as
applied
to
the
particular
facts
in
this
case.
we
ask
therefore
that
the
convictions
be
set
aside.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
not
able
to
see
respondent's
brief
until
late
monday
because
i
had
been
out
of
the
country
for
some
weeks
and
i
therefore
prepared
a
xerox,
a
very
short
reply
brief
dealing
with
one
point
in
respondent's
brief
which
i
would
like
to
submit
and
will
replace
by
a
printed
brief
in
the
requisite
number
of
copies
and
so
on
when
i
get
back
to
new
york
tomorrow
or
friday.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
have
given
my
advisory
a
copy.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
this
is
on
appeal
rather
by
certiorari
here
from
conviction
of
a
group
of
individuals
in
the
criminal
court
of
the
city
of
new
york,
convictions
which
where
affirmed
by
the
appropriate
appellant
court
and
then
reviewed
by
new
york's
highest
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
affirmed
without
opinion,
but
with
an
amendment
to
the
remitted
toward
indicating
the
constitutional
issues
had
been
raised
which
are
the
precise
constitutional
issues
referred
to
in
the
petition.
the
case
arose
as
a
result
of
the
meeting
held
in
an
area
just
north
of
times
square
in
new
york
city
known
as
duffy
square,
which
is
a
triangular
area
between
broadway
and
7th
avenue
and
this
was
a
meeting
protesting
the
vietnam
war
and
it
began
around
4
o'clock
on
a
certain
afternoon
in
summer
time.
the
testimony
is
somewhat
in
conflict
which
i
will
develop
later,
but
before
i
get
to
the
testimony
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
hear
exactly
what
the
complaint
contained,
because
my
first
contention
is
that
these
petitioners
were
convicted
for
things
not
specified
in
the
complaint.
that
conviction
therefore
cannot
stand
being
a
denial
of
due
process
under
de
jonge
against
oregon,
cole
against
arkansas,
thomson
against
louisiana,
and
garner
against
--
now
the
complaint
says
this.
at
4:25
pm
on
august
8,
1964,
vicinity
duffy
square,
47th
street
and
broadway
the
defendants
did
unlawfully
congregate
and
assembled
at
the
above
location
obstructing
the
area
to
the
exclusion
of
those
wishing
to
use
the
same
and
did
delay
vehicular
traffic
while
carrying
placards
and
using
loud
and
boisterous
language;
by
their
actions
did
cause
a
crowd
to
collect.
when
ordered
to
move
on
the
defendants
did
fail
to
do
so,
after
being
informed
that
their
actions
were
not
lawful
and
the
references
of
course
to
the
new
york
disorderly
conduct
statute,
appeal
law
section
722
specifically
to
sections
2,
3
and
4
to
which
i
will
come
later.
now
it
was
the
defense's
contention
at
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
oh
yes.
it
was
the
defendant's
contention
at
the
trial,
it
is
that
contention
all
the
way
up
at
here
that
this
complaint
charged
them
with
holding
an
unlawful
meeting
which
the
police
had
a
right
to
disperse
because
the
meeting
was
unlawful
in
the
respects
indicated.
whereas
at
the
trial
there
was
testimony
produced
over
objection
by
the
defense
specifically
on
that
ground.
from
various
acts
committed
by
most
of
these
petitioners
although
curiously
enough
not
all,
which
occurred
after
the
order
to
disperse,
beyond
the
mere
allegation
of
the
complaint
that
they
refused
to
move
on,
act
such
as
two
of
them
lying
down
on
the
street.
one
of
them
hit
a
policeman's
horse,
others
running
around
and
interfering
with
the
police's
attempts
to
break
up
the
meeting,
various
acts
which
was
stressed
in
the
appealing
of
the
appellant
term
affirming
the
convictions
as
justifying
them.
now
our
view
is
that
except
for
the
failure
to
move
on,
nothing
which
happened
after
the
order
to
disperse
is
relevant
to
this
particular
complaint
which
rests
on
the
proposition
that
before
there
was
an
order
to
move
on,
there
was
an
unlawful
assemblage.
we
submit
that
therefore
the
convictions
cannot
stand
because
in
the
first
place
no
one
can
tell
from
this
record
whether
these
petitioners
were
convicted
because
there
was
an
unlawful
meeting
before
the
order
to
disperse
or
because
of
unlawful
conduct
afterwards.
the
trial
court
wrote
no
opinion
in
finding
all
of
the
defendants
guilty,
although
some
distinction
was
made
in
the
sentence,
three
of
them
were
fined
$25
and
the
others
were
fined
with
suspended
sentences.
but
the
appellant
term
expressly
relied
on
these
subsequent
events
as
justifying
the
convictions
and
so
does
my
opponent
in
his
brief
here.
now
he
says
that
the
complaint
is
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
which
he
gives
to
it
and
which
the
appellant
term
gave
to
it,
because
of
the
reference
in
the
beginning
of
the
complaint
to
this
time
of
4:25
pm,
to
which
i
say
two
things.
in
the
first
place
these
defendants
were
not
operating
at
that
meeting
with
stop
watches
in
their
hands
so
that
they
would
know
at
what
time
of
the
meeting
4:25
arose,
but
in
the
second
place
and
this
i
consider
to
be
basic
and
this
what
is
discussed
in
my
brief
reply,
under
new
york
law,
well
settled
law
as
decided
by
our
court
of
appeals,
the
time
mentioned
in
a
charge
is
of
no
relevant
and
whatever,
except
in
those
rare
cases
where
it
might
have
some
relevance
as
to
whether
an
offense
is
committed
in
the
day
time
or
at
night,
but
otherwise
it's
no
relevant
whatever
and
the
prosecution
is
in
no
way
bound
by
it,
but
can
prove
the
offenses
occurring
at
any
time.
so
that
the
reference
to
4:25
we
submit
gave
no
notice
or
warning
to
these
defendants
that
they
were
going
to
be
charged
with
things
that
occurred
after
the
order
to
disperse
even
if
any
of
them
had
been
conscious
of
the
fact
that
order
was
given
before
4:25.
now
here
is
what
the
testimony
showed.
and
i
should
point
out
that
there
were
three
classes
of
witness
at
this
trial;
police
officers,
defendants,
and
a
reporter
for
the
new
york
times,
a
man
by
the
name
of
joseph
lelyveld
who
is
by
line
members
of
this
court
may
have
seen
in
the
times
in
recent
months.
he
was
there
in
his
capacity
as
a
reporter.
he
is
only
therefore
disinterested
person
in
our
view.
now
the
testimony
was
that
almost
immediately
after
the
meeting
began
and
some
words
were
stated,
a
police
captain
and
inspector
came
up
to
the
person
holding
the
meeting
and
told
him
the
meeting
had
to
disperse.
neither
the
captain
nor
the
police
inspector
testified
at
this
trial.
what
they
said
was
testified
to
differently
by
the
different
groups
of
people.
one
and
only
one
police
officer
said
that
he
heard
the
captain
talk
about
obstruction
of
traffic.
the
reporter
from
the
times
said
nothing
was
said
about
obstruction
of
traffic
and
that
was
supported
by
the
defendants.
there
is
another
significant
element
to
this.
this
police
officer
had
a
tape
recording
of
what
was
said
by
the
speaker
at
the
meeting.
that
tape
recording
for
some
unexplained
reason
did
not
contain
anything
said
by
the
police
captain
when
approaching
the
speakers,
but
it
did
contain
what
the
speakers
said
immediately
in
response,
which
was
that
they
considered
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
hold
a
peaceable
meeting
and
that
was
the
whole
thrust
of
the
discussion
insofar
as
it
appeared.
now
up
to
that
point
the
evidence
of
the
times
reporter
was
the
meeting
was
orderly,
no
excitement,
no
undue
noise,
there
were
perhaps
60
or
70
people
present.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
your
honor,
there
is
a
photograph
of
it
in
the
record
i
don't
know
that
the
exact
size
with
specify,
do
we
have
the
exact
size?
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
there
is
a
--
mr.
(inaudible)
has
given
me.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
would
say
its
looks
to
be
about
30
feet
wide
at
its
widest
and
â€“
you
haven't
got
the
dimensions
and
the
length?
i
would
guess
about
150
feet.
it
occupies
roughly
two
blocks,
between
45th
and
47th
street
with
a
triangular
shape
in
between
them.
now
the
only
evidence
prior
to
the
order
to
disperse
with
respect
to
possible
justification
was
the
evidence
of
one
policeman,
but
there
had
been
some
overflow
of
people
from
these
paved
area
raised
above
the
street,
on
to
the
street
itself
and
that
some
cars
had
to
swerve
to
avoid
these
people
who
were
there.
but
he
testified
that
he
had
not
ordered
the
people
to
go
back
on
to
the,
what
would
be
called
the
sidewalk
of
the
square.
here
is
the
enlarged
duffy
square.
this
was
not
in
the
record
but
i
have
no
objection
of
it
being
considered
by
the
court.
so
that
our
contention
is
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
whatever
in
this
record
justifying
the
original
order
to
disperse.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
this
began
around
4
o'clock.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
was
it
a
saturday?
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
was
a
saturday
afternoon.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
august.
now
it
is
true
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
that,
there's
some
questions
about
it.
mr.
lelyveld
testified
they
were
about
60
odd
people
in
the
meeting.
the
police
officer
said
they
were
about
200.
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
about
thousands
of
people
walking
along
on
the
sidewalks,
would
be
these
sidewalks
you
see
the
normal
sidewalks
on
which
people
travel
in
that
area
all
the
time,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
prior
to
the
order
to
disperse
a
crowd
collected,
that
any
relation
to
the
meeting
other
than
people
who
were
at
the
meeting
themselves.
no
evidence
that
these
people
wandering
along
the
sidewalk
where
in
anyway
disturbed
or
affected
by
anything
which
occurred
at
the
meeting.
now
there
is
evidence
that
after
the
order
to
disperse,
at
least
i
should
point
out
that
the
first
order
to
disperse
was
followed
by
these
remarks
of
the
speaker
that
they
had
a
right
to
continue
to
hold
the
meeting
and
then
came
almost
immediately
a
second
order
to
disperse.
somewhere
in
respondent's
briefs
there
is
mention
of
a
half
hour
interval,
but
there
is
no
such
testimony
in
the
record,
the
times
are
not
given
specifically
clearly
enough.
but
in
any
case
there
is
no
doubt
that
after
the
second
order
to
disperse,
certain
amount
of
disorder
resulted
and
had
some
of
these
individuals
been
prosecuted
specifically
what
that
kind
of
disorder
as
the
two
persons
who
were
charged
with
having
laying
down
on
the
sidewalk,
or
the
one
who
claimed
--is
charged
with
having
hit
a
horse,
a
policeman's
horse
although
his
testimony
was
that
he
hit
that
horse
because
the
horse
was
about
to
trample
on
somebody
who
had
fallen
near
it
and
he
wanted
to
divert
the
horse.
so
i
say
had
they
been
specifically
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
of
that
kind,
the
issues
before
this
court
would
be
all
together
different.
i
doubt
whether
the
case
would
be
here
before
this
court
but
in
it's
present
posture
we
contend
first
as
i
have
said,
that
this
complaint
did
not
justify
use
of
any
of
the
evidence
as
to
what
could
be
called
disorderly
acts
of
the
persons
after
the
order
to
disperse
other
than
their
mere
failure
to
obey
that
order
and
that,
that
failure
was
not
constitutionally,
is
the
subject
of
a
charge,
because
the
police
at
that
stage
had
no
justification
for
giving
the
order,
but
in
any
case
because
of
the
way
in
which
this
case
was
decided
both
below
and
in
the
appellate
court,
no
one
can
determine
on
which
basis
the
convictions
rested,
so
that
the
cases
somewhat
like
that
of
an
improper
charge
to
a
jury
such
as
was
condemned
many,
many
years
ago
for
instance
in
the
california
red
flag
case,
the
stromberg
case.
and
therefore
what
is
involved
here,
is
an
interference
with
a
lawful
meeting
held
for
a
lawful
purpose
of
speech,
to
be
sure
the
speech
in
connection
with
an
unpopular
cause
and
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
which
in
my
judgment
justifies
the
inference
that
it
was
the
unpopularity
of
the
subject
of
the
meeting
which
induced
the
original
order
to
disperse.
the
testimony
is
that
the
officer
told
the
people
in
charge
of
the
meeting
that
they
had
no
rights
to
conduct
the
meeting,
not
that
he
told
them
that
they
were
obstructing
traffic.
now
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
i
don't
know
of
any
such
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
was
an
offer
of
proof,
that
other
meetings
had
been
held
in
this
area
and
that
was
rejected
by
the
trial
court.
it's
not
a
place
like
union
square
which
has
a
traditional
character
or
used
to
have
because
i
think
they
are
fewer
now
than
there
used
to
be,
but
in
any
event
speak
meetings
in
new
york
or
not
unusual
(inaudible)
and
as
i
say
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
to
show
that
meetings
had
been
held
there
in
connection
with
bond
rallies
and
some
other
subjects.
now
whether
that
offer
of
proof
could
have
been
sustained
we
can't
know,
but
it
was
rejected.
now
we
content
further
in
this
case
that
the
statute
as
here
applied
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
now
here
is
what
the
statute
says.
subdivision
2;
acts
in
such
a
manner
as
to
annoy,
disturb,
interfere
with,
obstruct
or
be
offensive
to
others.
subdivision
3;
congregates
with
others
on
a
public
street
and
refuses
to
move
on
when
ordered
by
the
police.
subdivision
4;
by
his
actions
causes
a
crowd
to
collect
except
when
lawfully
addressing
such
a
crowd.
now
as
to
the
first,
we
submit
that
as
to
what
constitutes
an
appearance
or
being
offensive
is
very
vague
and
in
fact
the
appellant
term
itself
recognized
that
i
thought
that
it
was
overcome
by
the
acts
which
occurred
subsequent
to
the
order
to
disperse.
but
we
submit
that
there
has
been
no
sufficiently
definite
definition
of
that
provision
and
that
the
final
case
on
which
reliance
was
placed
in
the
court,
in
the
appellant
term
by
my
opponent
does
not
support
the
convictions
in
these
cases
--
in
this
case.
as
this
court
will
recall,
finer
(ph)
was
convicted
because
he
made
a
speech
on
the
streets
of,
i
think
it
was
syracuse
or
rochester,
in
which
he
in
effect
urged
negroes
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
and
the
police
told
him
to
stop
because
the
people
around
where
getting
arrested
and
one
of
them
had
indicated
some
resentment
and
the
police
feared
that
there
would
be
some
kind
of
a
disturbance
resulting
from
these
inflammatory
remarks.
this
court,
although
divided
court,
upheld
that
conviction.
now
here
of
course
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind.
they
were
no
inflammatory
remarks.
no
one
urged
to
do
anything
improper.
there
was
no
resentment
from
anyone
listening.
there
was
therefore
no
basis
for
the
police
believing
that
any
unlawful
conduct
would
result
from
the
continuation
of
this
meeting.
now
the
second
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
of
course
the
use
of
the
word
they,
don't
forget
your
honor,
mr.
justice
there
were
17
people
charged
here
jointly.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
joint
unlawful
conduct,
none
whatsoever.
had
there
been
any
reference
to
these
specific
wrong
doings
in
the
complaint
that
it
would
have
been
appropriate
for
the
defendants
to
try
to
get
severance,
so
different
people
charged
with
the
different
kind
of
things
would
receive
discreet
treatment.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
am
talking
the
time
of
the
order
to
disperse
the
meeting.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
after
all
until
there
was
an
order
to
disperse
there
was
no
reason
for
dispersing
and
the
order
can
be
justified
only
by
what
occurred
prior
to
the
order
not
by
what
occurred
afterwards.
this
is
the
reverse
of
the
search
and
cease
situation
where
the
search
can
be
justified
by
what's
found
afterwards,
but
not
by
what
was
found
before.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
not
everybody.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
no
that's
not
strictly
accurate
because
at
least
three
of
these
petitioners
were
never
charged
with
by
any
witness
with
having
done
anything
and
the
appellant
term
in
its
opinion
so
recognizes.
they
were
simply
important
people
in
connection
with
the
meeting,
but
it's
true
that
most
of
the
people
arrested
were
by
testimony
connected
with
some
act
which
had
it
been
separately
charged
as
a
separate
act
and
no
merely
as
a
failure
to
move
on
when
ordered
to
break
up
a
peaceful
meeting.
what
if
just
they
found
true,
would
have
justified
a
conviction
and
as
i
said
before
wouldn't
have
come
to
this
court.
now
we
come
then
to
the
next
subdivision,
the
congregation
with
others
on
a
public
street,
refuse
to
move
on
when
ordered
by
the
police
well
that's
obviously
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
not
every
order
by
a
policeman,
because
people
have
congregated
two
or
three
people
talk
together
can
be
justified
particularly
not
when
a
meeting
is
being
held
to
discuss
some
matter
of
public
importance
and
therefore
we
can't
suppose
that
the
conviction
rested
on
this.
and
finally
we
have
the
vary
vague
ambiguous
provision,
by
his
action
causes
a
crowd
to
collect
to
except
when
lawfully
addressing
such
a
crowd,
well
that's
what
we
contend
happened
here,
he
was
lawfully
addressing
such
a
crowd
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
which
suggests
what
constitutes
lawfully
addressing
a
crowd
and
what
doesn't
constitute
lawfully
addressing
a
crowd
and
there
are
no
standards
whatsoever
in
this
statute.
so
that
we
contend
first
that
the
complaint
restricted
the
charge
to
what
occurred
prior
to
the
order
to
disperse.
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
that
anything
which
occurred
prior
to
the
order
to
disperse
justified
that
order.
and
that
therefore
the
order
was
unconstitutional
as
an
interference
with
freedom
of
expression
along
the
lines
of
many
cases
which
this
court
has
recently
decided
which
i
have
cited
on
my
brief,
which
have
taken
the
general
view
that
a
broad
disorderly
conduct
statute
cannot
be
made
the
basis
for
interference
with
free
expression.
that
if
there
are
particular
circumstances
or
places
where
such
expression
is
improper
or
inappropriate
then
legislation
should
be
wise
dealing
with
such
situations
so
that
people
generally
maybe
advised
of
what
their
rights
are,
but
that
the
broad
catch
all,
this
orderly
conduct
charge
is
inappropriate
to
deal
with
such
matters.
finally
we
contend
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
justifying
these
convictions
because
nobody
can
determine
from
this
record
whether
they
arrested
on
the
police
or
the
trier
of
the
facts,
that
the
meeting
was
unlawful
and
therefore
the
police
had
to
right
to
break
it
up
or
whether
the
convictions
rested
on
the
police
or
the
trier
of
the
facts
that
what
occurred
after
the
order
to
disperse
justified
the
conviction.
and
in
that
state
of
doubt
we
submit
there
can
be
no
convictions
because
there
can
be
no
proper
basis
for
appellate
review
and
as
i
said
just
a
moment
ago
we
also
claim
that
as
here
applied
these
three
provisions
of
the
law
under
which
the
convictions
--
on
which
the
convictions
rested
are
unconstitutionally
vague
at
least
as
applied
to
the
particular
facts
in
this
case.
we
ask
therefore
that
the
convictions
be
set
aside.
