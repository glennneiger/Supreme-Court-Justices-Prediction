justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
griffin
really
rests
on
the
evidentiary
of
this
utility
of
comments
or
that
the
comments
have
no
evidence
regarding
or
the
silence
has
no
evidentiary
value
at
all,
do
you
think
it
rests
on
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
difference?
that
doesn't
--
that's
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
that's
what
the
court
said
that
that
isn't
--
did
it
say
that
silence
has
no
evidentiary
value?
a
lot
of
things
i
believe
the
evidentiary
value
you
can't
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
state
doesn't
argue
with
that
here
that
there
was
a
violation
of
griffin,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
arguing
that
this
error
would
harm
your
client
because
it
really
was
the
major
ingredient
in
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
suppose
the
--
if
the
evidence
is
so
clear
of
guilt
in
these
cases
and
why
do
you
suppose
the
prosecutor
thinks
he
has
to
comment?
statute
doesn't
require
him
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here
--
he
just
says
well,
it's
overwhelming
evidence
but
i'll
just
show
you
a
few
comments
that
it
lays
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know,
why
do
you
think
prosecutor
is
really
--
is
going
to
hurt
that
case
they
wouldn't
do
it
it's
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
wouldn't
do
it
just
neutrally,
would
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
do
you
think
it's
going
to
help
them
a
little
bit?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
know
better
than
the
prosecutor.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
but
counsel
--
justice
byron
r.
white
factually,
you
said
there
is
no
federal
question.
what
if
the
claim
is
which
it
is
that
if
you
leave
that
evidence
in
the
trial
then
leave
--
still
leave
it
up
to
jury
to
decide,
the
man
is
not
--
have
--
had
a
fair
trial
if
unconstitutionally
obtained
evidence
for
example
is
--
remains
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
a
fair
trial,
a
claim
of
fair
trial
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
there
was
a
claim
of
this
--
of
an
--
what
if
there
was
a
claim
in
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
that
evidence
in
the
case,
he
didn't
have
a
fair
trial,
that's
a
federal
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
take
it
that
the
california
courts
have
not
retried
this
man
in
the
appellate
courts.
they
have
not
said,
“now
look,
we
know
that
there
is
--
that
there's
--
that
there
was
prosecutorial
comment
here
that
was
not
permitted
by
the
constitution
but
now
we
are
going
to
put
that
aside
and
we
as
an
appellate
court
are
going
to
examine
all
the
rest
of
the
evidence
then
we
have
and
we
find
that
we
find
them
guilty.”
that
isn't
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
say.
you
say
that
--
but
you
say
that
the
jury
trial,
it
stands
because
of
the
prediction
or
the
feeling
that
this
evidence
could
not
have
had
any
impact,
that
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

do
