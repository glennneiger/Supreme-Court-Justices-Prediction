justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
the
issue
was
a
little
different?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
i
thought
the
issue
was
not
whether
these
particular
comments
were
harmless
that
and
the
state's
submission
whether
on
the
basis
of
the
balance
of
the
evidence,
the
case
was
overwhelming
so
that
the
error
complain
did
not
result
in
miscarriage
of
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
sir
for
a
moment.
excuse
me.
justice
abe
fortas
on
your
first
part
of
view
has
--
do
you
suggest
in
practice
in
the
california
has
changed?
justice
abe
fortas
what
would
you
do
today?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
would
follow
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
i
suppose
that
what
you
got
here
in
terms
of
a
liable
question
general
applicability
is
what
like
this
case
throws
on
your
use
of
the
harmless
error
provision
in
the
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
say
that
we
look
at
the
whole
case
is
that
because
your
theory
that
the
record
as
a
whole
contains
proof
of
guilt
that
the
error
was
harmless?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
your
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
what
purpose
then?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what's
your
standard
determine
whether
there
is
harm,
is
that
whether
they
--
in
our
judgment
the
defendant
was
guilty
or
whether
excluding
this
or
that
may
mean
rest
of
the
record
shows
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt
and
we
can't
conceive
the
jury
arriving
at
different
result
or
what?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happened
that
day
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
one
of
your
prosecutors
and
one
of
the
judges
made
a
mistake
and
made
the
same
comments,
would
you
still
think
that
california
would
consider
their
harmless
error?
justice
abe
fortas
but
why?
why
if
there
was
harmless
error
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
there
was
harmless
error
before
why
isn't
there
harmless
error
now?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
those
words
disturbed
me
but
suppose
exactly
the
same
thing
happens
based
on
the
question
of
(voice
overlap)
harmless
error,
doesn't
the
harmless
error
today
was
harmless
error
then
or
vice
versa?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
inviting
us
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
inviting
us
to
conclude
from
the
entire
record
that
these
people
are
guilty
and
therefore
we
are
to
disregard
the
error.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
it's
grievous,
its
not
harming
us,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
--
are
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
or
are
you
not
attempting
to
defend
the
provision
in
your
constitution,
article
6
section
4.5
which
says
that
in
effect
that
the
error
is
harmless
unless
the
courts
of
the
opinion
that
error
complained
of
has
resulted
in
a
miscarriage
of
justice
and
how
do
you
construe
that
in
the
defendant
are
not
error,
can
you
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
it
is,
that
it
--
that
the
--
its
defensible
as
applied
in
this
case,
or
defensible
generally,
what
is
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
in
my
mind
that's
the
key
problem
here.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
had
not
been
so
if
it
had
not
so
narrowed
by
the
--
by
decisions
of
the
california
courts,
would
you
say
to
us
that
it
does
or
does
not
conflict
with
the
federal
constitution?
justice
abe
fortas
but
we
don't
have
an
alternative,
do
we?
we
have
to
deal
with
words.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
prosecuting
attorney
here
or
the
judge
or
both
had
said
the
--
to
the
jury
that
petitioner
failed
to
take
the
stand
and
that
it's
reasonable
to
infer
from
that
that
the
petitioner
was
guilty.
and
was
guilty
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i
mean
he
was
guilty.
now,
would
that
present
a
federal
question?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
who
--
i
know
but
that
--
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
california
court
says
this
is
harmless
error,
is
that
--
would
that
present
a
federal
question?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
the
comment
was
that
the
failure
to
take
the
stand
is
in
effect
a
confession.
justice
abe
fortas
that
were
not
presented
in
the
--
california
court
says
that's
harmless
error.
you
say
would
have
no
jurisdiction,
however,
would
no
--
there'd
be
no
federal
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
court
--
the
court's
enumeration
of
the
comments
that
were
made
with
respect
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand
appears
on
page
60,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
does
the
government,
i
mean
to
say,
does
a
state
dispute
that
part
of
the
court's
opinion,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
says
on
page
60
that
one
of
the
comments
related
to
the
implication
would
be
drawn
as
i
read
it
in
failure
to
testify
with
respect
and
i
quote
“to
the
overall
commission
of
the
crime”,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
the
issue
was
