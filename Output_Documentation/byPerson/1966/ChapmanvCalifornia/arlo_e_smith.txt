mr.
arlo
e.
smith
how
much
time
do
i
have
left
your
honor?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course,
to
properly
concede
that
there
was
a
comment
and
instruction
that
comment
with
reference
to
both
defendants
was
in
violation
of
the
griffin
doctrine.
however,
before
i
go
into
the
matter
any
detail,
i
feel
that
in
light
of
the
statements
made
here
except
the
statement
of
counsel
the
tracking
of
earlier
statement.
i
feel
that
we
have
a
3000-page
record
here.
the
brief
is
replete
with
allegations
of
unfairness
and
i
would
like
to
correct
two
or
three
impressions
created
by
that
brief.
as
pointed
out
by
counsel,
he
is
correct
of
the
impression
that
the
district
attorney
here
and
the
trial
judge
deliberately
violated
the
doctrine
of
the
law
in
griffin.
this
case
was
tried
in
1963,
one
year
before
the
malloy
decision
came
down
and
two
years
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
griffin
versus
california.
those
comments
as
suggested
in
the
tehan
case
occurred
in
virtually
every
california
case
where
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
witness
stand.
this
is
one
of
those
cases.
those
statements
were
made
and
the
instruction
was
given
based
upon
50
years
of
constitutional
law
set
down
in
twine
and
in
adamson
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
trial
judge
and
the
counsel
followed
the
constitution
of
california
at
that
time.
secondly,
counsel
has
suggested
that
somehow
there
has
been
a
conspiracy
or
a
fraud
down
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
here
to
prevent
the
defendant
chapman
from
taking
the
witness
stand.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
absolutely.
if
this
happened
today,
we
will
have
entirely
different
case.
i
suggest
it
would
not
be
here.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
today,
your
honor,
i
--
there
would
be
no
comment.
obviously
that
practice
is
eliminated.
there
would
normally
be
an
instruction
akin
to
that
required
in
federal
practice.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
and
if
this
happen
today,
i
think
that
under
california
practice
we
would
have
a
--
the
case
would
not
be
here.
not
because
there
was
no
harm
but
before
a
different
state
policy
that
under
the
case
that
you've
cited
here,
the
case
of
people
versus
burnett
that
deliberate
and
flagrant
conduct
of
both
that
trial
counsel,
the
district
attorney
and
the
judge
would
be
misconduct
and
would
be
reversed.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
the
harmless
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
--
yes,
i
wish
to
make
that
argument.
i
was
simply
arguing
that
this
point
that
there
was
no
misconduct
that
but
that
is
an
argument
that
i
do
seek
to
pursue,
the
allegation
has
been
made
here
that
indeed
the
harmless
error
rule
has
been
applied
deliberately
by
the
california
courts
to
avoid
the
operation
of
griffin.
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs
cases
where
the
district
courts
of
appeal
or
intermediate
appellate
courts
in
fact
have
affirmed
convictions
where
commenting
in
violation
of
griffin
occur.
likewise,
we
have
brought
to
your
attention
some
dozen
cases
where
the
california
courts
have
reversed
those
convictions
because
it
found
the
comment
in
the
context
of
the
entire
case
to
be
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
to
be
a
--
to
be
prejudicial,
to
be
harmful
to
violate
our
harmless
error
rule.
likewise,
the
california
supreme
court
has
granted
here
in
cases
where
the
intermediate
appellate
courts
have
found
the
comment
to
be
harmless
and
affirmed.
so,
in
fact
there
was
no
deliberate
use
of
the
harmful
error
rule
to
undercut
the
decisions
of
this
court.
but
returning,
if
i
may,
to
the
general
allegation
that's
been
made
here
in
reference
to
the
conspiracy
to
keep
the
defendant
chapman
on
the
stand
the
allegations
that
somehow
the
--
she
was
denied
counsel.
there
was
a
denial
of
the
speedy
trial.
let
me
correct
that
record
before
we
discuss
the
real
questions
here.
under
california
practice,
award
was
based
upon
a
complaint.
mrs.
chapman
was
arrested
in
st.
joseph,
missouri
october
26,
1962.
she
was
brought
back
to
california,
the
record
shows
and
we
cited
it,
october
30,
1962.
the
record
reflects
that
she
was
arraigned
in
california
the
very
next
day,
october
31
or
she
was
advised
of
her
right
to
counsel
of
all
the
rights.
a
counsel
was
then
appointed,
immediately
appointed.
not
a
month
later
as
suggested
by
counsel.
and
the
same
sequence
occurred
in
reference
to
the
defendant
teale
when
he
was
brought
back
from
louisiana
and
of
course
after
the
initial
arraignment
instead
of
proceeding.
by
way
of
information,
that
case
was
brought
to
the
grand
jury
and
the
indictment
was
then
brought.
the
defendants
were
re-arraigned
on
november
16,
counsel
was
again
appointed
to
defend
them
in
that
indictment,
the
very
same
counsel
that
had
been
appointed
on
the
earlier
dates.
finally,
there's
an
allegation
here
that
the
defendant
--
that
the
prosecutor
here
kept
the
defendant
chapman
from
taking
the
stand
by
virtue
of
the
delays,
by
virtue
of
--
this
was
part
of
his
tactic.
but
i
think
that
if
you
examine
this
record
you
will
see
very
plainly
that
the
trial
dates,
the
times
and
the
trial
dates
were
agreed
to
by
her
counsel
that
it
was
suggested
shortly
before
the
first
trial
date
that
there
was
a
conflict
that
the
public
between
the
two
defendants
and
the
public
defendant
could
not
properly
represent
both.
the
court
immediately
appointed
separate
counsel
for
mrs.
chapman.
shortly
thereafter
and
a
new
trial
date
was
again
selected
about
a
month
forward,
the
defendant
chapman
filed
an
affidavit
alleging
in
demanding
in
support
of
a
motion
for
a
separate
trial
alleging
that
the
public
defender
had
special
knowledge
which
could
be
used
in
cross
examining
her.
the
judge
then
denied
the
motion
for
a
separate
trial
and
appointed
new
counsel
for
the
defendant
teale.
the
matter
was
then
delayed
for
another
month
in
order
that
that
counsel
could
properly
prepare
and
defend
the
case.
finally,
there's
an
allegation
that
somehow
made
here
again
in
argument
that
the
prosecutor
sought
to
get
her
statement
which
she
said
--
he
said
was
taken
without
counsel.
the
record
reflects
in
fact
that
what
he
is
referring
to
appears
to
be
statement
which
the
defendant
introduced
via
the
testimony
of
a
psychiatrist
and
i
think
important
to
this
entire
case
is
the
defense
and
this
goes
to
the
defense
of
mrs.
chapman.
mrs.
chapman's
defense
was
from
the
very
outset
in
this
case
that
she
was
present
in
all
times,
that
she
did
not,
however,
have
the
specific
intent.
now,
the
--
in
california
or
practices
for
the
prosecutor
to
make
an
opening
statement
present
his
testimony,
the
defense
counsel
to
make
his
opening
statement
and
to
present
his
testimony.
however,
in
this
case,
after
the
prosecutor
had
made
his
opening
statement,
defense
counsel
requested
opportunity
to
make
his
opening
statement
out
of
term
and
the
judge
granted
that.
he
then
stated
as
his
defense
in
fact
in
admission
of
her
presence
at
the
scene
of
the
robbery,
that
kidnapping
and
the
murder.
the
defense
then
established
through
that
the
psychiatrist
not
dr.
winkler
but
dr.
sherman,
the
defense
psychiatrist
that
she
did
not
or
possibly
had
a
hysterical
alcoholic
blackout,
disassociated
status
the
psychiatrist
say
that
she
could
not
formulate
the
specific
intent
to
commit
these
crimes
but
as
a
part
of
that
basis
for
the
psychiatrist's
opinion,
the
psychiatrist
testifies
both
as
to
what
she
had
told
them
and
over
objection
by
the
prosecution.
defense
counsel
read
a
statement
which
she
gave
or
read
great
portions
of
the
statement
which
he
had
previously
given
to
the
deputy
district
attorney.
there
is
no
foundation.
the
statement
was
at
no
time
offered
by
the
prosecution.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
the
background
for
the
taking
of
the
statement.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
doctor
winkler
was
called
--
well,
there's
an
allegation
here
that
this
was
a
conspiracy
and
that
in
fact
there's
a
ball
of
statement
made
that
the
calling
of
dr.
winkler
and
the
presenting
of
his
testimony
violates
griffin.
dr.
winkler
was
simply
called
then
in
rebuttal.
and
further
i
think
it
is
important
of
course
in
any
event
that
we
must
examine
the
entire
record,
the
entire
case
and
not
merely
as
counsel
for
petitioner
has
asserted
that
we
look
at
the
--
only
at
the
statements
made
here,
the
instruction
given
or
the
comment
made
and
determined
from
that
whether
or
not
there
was
harm.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
your
honor.
that
is
not
what
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
not
the
rule
in
california.
you
must
examine
the
entire
cause.
you
must
look
at
the
error
in
the
context
of
the
entire
cause.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
harm
to
this
particular
defense.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
the
california
constitution
speaks
in
terms
of
examination
of
the
entire
record
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
however,
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
people
versus
watson,
set
down
the
rule
that
what
this
means
is
that
we
must
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
reasonably
probable
that
the
errors
complained
of
would
not
have
led
to
a
different
result.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
if
this
court
suggested
in
tehan,
this
can
correct
me
so
that
this
has
happened
virtually
in
every
case.
it
becomes
a
courtroom
dramatics.
it's
the
dramatic
impact
that
here
we've
established
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
of
course.
of
course
it
doesn't
hurt
that
case
and
there's
no
--
it
doesn't
know
in
that
sense.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
might
although
i
suggest
that
they
--
that
you're
correct
that
they
believe
that
it
has
some
effect
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
certainly.
certainly,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
in
fact
that
helps
me
if
they
need
it
on
the
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
you
--
many
your
opinion
suggests
that
you
do.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
would
now
like
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
did
not
follow
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
but
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
would
make
this
distinction
that
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
statement
made
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
our
reason
for
saying
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
i
say
that
two
things.
first
of
all,
of
course
the
judge
did
instruct
them
and
that
this
is
an
influence
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
there
was
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
pe
--
that
the
people
must
prove
their
case
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
no
presumption
of
guilt
as
a
result
of
the
failure
of
the
defendants
to
testify.
as
far
as
in
the
second
part
of
it,
of
course
it
is
our
contention
you
must
examine
the
particular
error
in
the
light
of
everything
that
happened
here.
in
other
words,
the
point
that
i
was
making
i
need
not
repeat
now
earlier
was
that
here
we
have
this
particular
defense
of
the
defendant
chapman
for
example.
really,
the
defense
was
that
she
blocked
out,
not
that
she
wasn't
there
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
there
was
nothing
--
you
cannot
infer
her
guilt.
you
can
simply,
in
a
given
set
of
circumstances
where
the
defendant
might
have
had
some
information,
the
jury
where
they
can
draw
private
different
inferences
may
take
the
inference
against
that
particular
--
that
defendant
who
did
not
testify
but
as
to
a
particular
item
of
proof
and
not
that
you
can
infer
her
guilt.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
yes.
but
and
not
that
you
can
infer
her
guilt,
not
that
you
--
that
it's
proof
of
presumption
of
guilt
but
simply
has
related
to
a
particular
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
piece
of
evidence.
as
i
said
here,
with
the
defense
really
is
block
out,
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
commented
that
she
could
explain
why
she
purchased
those
guns
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
certainly
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
this
--
certainly
she
had
a
right
not
to
but
this
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
how
do
i
make
that
harmless
error?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
--
i
examine
the
entire
record
and
see
what
effect
this
has.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
that's
not
the
mere
test.
not
simply
that
she's
guilty
but
whether
or
not
whether
she
reasonably
probable
that
the
error
complained
of
would
have
brought
about
the
different
result.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
it's
not
simply
weighing
of
--
it's
not
simply
the
weighing
of
evidence
of
guilt
but
if
in
fact
that
error
assisted
in
bringing
about
that
verdict
to
that
result.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i'm
suggesting
that
it
did
not
--
not
reasonably
probable
that
it
had
any.
i'm
arguing
that
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
that
it
affected
the
trial
in
light
of
the
entire
evidence
in
this
case,
in
light
of
the
entire
proceeding
for
defense
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
of
course
that
bring
us
back
to
another
argument
and
it
is
been
suggested
in
the
dissents
in
the
earlier
cases
that
there
is
some
question
as
to
the
influence
of
the
jury.
the
fact
that
she
did
not
testify
and
he
did
not
testify
is
a
fact
that
the
jury
is
aware
of
that
they're
going
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
and
the
fact
that
we
have
carefully
controlled
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
of
course
this
goes
back
to
the
policies
behind
griffin
that
then
i
can
see
but
this
is
simply
a
fact
that
the
jury
is
well
aware
of,
one
which
they
may
naturally
whether
instructed
or
uninstructed
where
the
comment
is
made
or
not
are
going
to
have
in
their
mind
or
practice
specifically
instructs
them
how
they
must
limit
that
fact
that
they
can
draw
no
presumption
of
guilt,
that
they
--
that
the
people
have
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
now,
the
counsel
here
for
the
petitioner
draws
an
analogy
to
confession
cases.
they
say
that
those
cases
established
that
you
must
reverse
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
but
i
think
this
leads
us
to
in
to
the
very
problem
that
we're
concerned
with
and
that
is,
what
is
the
impact
of
these
statements
as
opposed
to
the
impact
of
a
confession.
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
confessions
are
--
when
introduced
result
in
reversal
has
a
result
of
the
pervasive
impact
that
it
has
and
secondly
because
it
impairs
the
very
fairness
of
the
fact
finding
procedure,
the
fairness
of
the
trial
the
very
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
procedure.
now,
the
court
--
this
court,
the
tehan
case
stated
that
the
comment
did
not
in
fact
impair
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
there's
no
--
they
didn't
get
any
evidence
but
there's
no
question
that
was
done
here
was
in
violation
of
the
griffin
rule.
no
question
about
that.
but
as
you
said
in
tehan,
determine
the
question
of
retroactivity
this
did
not
impair
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
processes
the
trial
court.
it's
our
contention
that
the
same
kind
of
analogy
can
and
must
be
draw
in
determining
whether
a
particular
constitutional
defect
is
to
be
subjected
to
the
harmless
error
rule.
it's
our
contention
that
harmless
error
rule
is
applicable
to
all
errors
constitutional
or
not
except
those
errors
that
impair
the
fairness
of
the
trial
that
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
processes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
we
take
the
position
that
this
is
a
question
of
state
law
and
not
a
constitutional
law.
we
take
the
position
that
you
must
examine
the
policies
of
the
rule
that
the
reason
for
the
rule
and
that
this
is
an
area
where
federalism
properly
has
applied
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
harmful
is
not
a
federal
question
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
except
it
we
take
the
case
like
louisville
versus
thompson.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
as
long
as
the
--
it's
our
position
that
is
long
as
the
state
standard,
the
state
rule
protects
what
we
call
fairness
that
to
say,
protects
those
rights
that
ensure
of
fair
trial
those
rights
that
are
related
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
that
that
states
must
reverse
but
as
to
any
other
error
then
it
can
properly
apply
its
own
standard
as
a
question
of
state
law
and
again
except
in
a
extreme
case
where
there's
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
application
of
that
rule
to
the
facts
of
that
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
harm
involved
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
your
honor.
if
that
case
--
this
case
were
tried
yesterday
and
were
then
presented
in
the
california
supreme
court
today,
it
would
be
reversed
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
would
be
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
because
under
california
law,
there
are
other
factors
because
if
these
were
done
today,
it
would
not
be
merely
a
violation
of
the
griffin
doctrine.
it
would
be
deliberate
flagrant
misconduct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
trial
judge
in
the
prosecutor
and
under
burnett
would
be
reversed.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
--
there
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
we
are
looking
--
we're
looking
beyond
harm
really.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
it
--
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
we
left
on
the
note
of
why
do
we
look
at
the
entire
record.
under
any
test
regardless
of
how
it
is
defined
it's
a
question
of
judgment,
its
judgmental,
as
just
--
justice
rutledge
said
in
the
koteakos
case,
you
must
examine
the
entire
proceeding.
this
case
said
is
fahy
versus
connecticut,
you
must
examine
the
impact
of
that
error
not
examine
the
error
alone
but
the
impact
of
that
error
upon
the
entire
case
to
see
whether
or
not
it
--
in
that
test,
was
reasonably
possible
that
it
contributed
to
the
conviction.
doesn't
matter
how
you
word
it,
that's
another
problem.
that
case,
there
was
illegally
obtained
evidence
introduced,
the
paint
in
the
brushes.
the
court
pointed
out
there
that
this
had
a
serious
impact
of
the
--
the
brush
marks
were
identified
as
being
identical
with
that
paint
--
painted
the
swastika.
the
paint
and
the
bucket
were
found
in
the
car
which
was
seen
near
the
scene.
the
court
pointed
out
that
in
fact
the
confrontation
of
this
illegal
evidence
probably
led
to
the
confession
that
was
introduced.
it
pointed
to
the
impact
of
that
testimony
upon
the
defense
concluding
that
it
probably
brought
about
the
presentation
of
the
defendant,
putting
the
defendant
on
the
stand.
now
what
is
the
impact
of
a
comment
hereupon
this
case?
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
none
when
you
examine
the
record
in
this
case.
it
had
none
of
these
factors
that
the
court
pointed
to
in
fahy.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
a
robbery,
murder
and
kidnapping
of
a
bartender
in
lodi.
the
evidence
although
the
petitioners
contend
that
there
was
no
evidence.
there
were
three
or
four
exhibits
not
introduced
but
the
story
is
a
very
simple
one.
there
was
conspiracy
between
mrs.
chapman
and
mr.
teale.
they
were
seeing
together
for
a
period
of
--
they
lived
together
for
a
period,
they
left
a
city
in
california
on
october
10,
they
went
to
reno.
there
she
purchased
a
--
which
turned
out
later
to
be
a
very
peculiar
22
automatic,
and
a
32.
thereafter
they
were
registered
jointly
in
a
motel
in
fresno
not
100
miles
below
the
scene
of
the
crime,
the
very
day
before
the
robbery,
kidnapping
and
murder.
he
signed
the
registration,
she
signed
would
turned
out
to
be
a
bad
check.
they
were
identified.
there
was
expert
testimony
all
the
way
through
as
to
the
signatures.
thereafter
that
evening,
they
were
seen
in
a
bar
called
--
bar
and
restaurant
called
croce's
in
city
of
lodi.
they
were
there
from
about
ten
until
shortly
after
one
o'clock.
there
were
various
things
that
occurred
there,
there
was
a
lot
of
discussions
but
they
were
positively
identified
there.
they
were
positively
established
that
they
were
driving
the
same
61
ford
that's
--
goes
throughout
the
proceedings.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
left
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
sir,
your
honor.
i
just
thought
that
i
had
point
out
--
pointed
out
to
you
that
what
we
are
doing
is
examining
to
see
what
impact
that
error
had.
rather
that
its
--
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
provision,
grievous
error
and
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
error
which
at
the
time
committed
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
--
it
--
those
are
different
concepts.
prejudicial
and
harmful
is
not
necessarily
grievous
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
--
there's
plain
error
instead
of
grievous.
i
extract
the
word
if
you
are
going
to
equate
it
to
harmless
or
prejudicial.
we're
talking
about
words
but
essentially
it's
judgmental.
they
went
into
the
--
they
left
this
bar.
mrs.
chapman
said,
“we
can't
do
anything
in
here,
let's
go.”
few
minutes
later
they
entered
the
bar
of
the
victim.
they
are
positively
identified
in
that
bar,
both
of
these
people
that
witnesses
point
out
that
in
fact
they
were
the
last
people
in
that
bar
when
the
bar
closed.
a
driver
who
had
been
--
knew
the
bartender
driving
a
truck
late
at
night
saw
and
identified
that
bartender
locking
the
door,
saw
a
man
and
a
woman
meeting
the
description
of
the
defendants
here
near
--
one
of
them
immediately
behind
him
and
the
other
one
nearer.
thereafter
the
next
morning
in
the
county
of
sacramento,
a
short
distance
away,
a
body
was
found,
the
body
of
the
victim.
he's
been
robbed,
his
wallet,
its
contents
thrown
around
and
underneath
the
body
is
--
found
a
check,
says,
“refer
to
maker”,
signed
by
mrs.
chapman.
and
the
time
of
death
as
established
by
the
coroner
and
the
experts
to
be
three
o'clock,
the
shooting
about
two
thirty.
this
witness
--
the
defendants
here
then
show
up
in
davis,
four
thirty
of
that
very
morning
and
register
under
the
false
of
kiel
rosenthal,
giving
a
false
license
plate
which
the
court
corrected.
thereafter
they
fled
the
state
of
california,
went
to
missouri
and
went
to
louisiana.
now,
as
to
teale,
when
he
was
arrested
in
louisiana
in
her
car,
the
very
car
used
in
the
murder
as
it's
established,
identified
with
the
(inaudible)
along.
he
is
brought
back
to
california.
he
makes
an
admission
there
about
lodi
to
the
fbi
agent.
he's
brought
back
to
california.
the
car
is
examined.
they
find
fibers
on
the
feet
of
the
victim
which
match
the
fibers
of
the
floorboard
of
the
car,
fibers
in
the
mat
of
the
car,
fibers
from
the
clothing
of
the
--
of
mrs.
chapman.
they
find
blood
pattern
that
--
the
same
type
of
the
victim's
in
the
automobile.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
find
that
the
defendant's
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
hair
on
the
shoes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
will
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
your
honor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what
i'm
saying
is
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
that
when
i
finish
my
recitation,
i
hope
to
convince
you
that
the
comment
had
nothing
to
do,
literally
nothing
to
do
or
certainly
no
reasonable
possibility
that
it
affect
of
the
outcome.
now
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
why?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
because
there
is
no
--
there
is
not
the
kind
of
things
that
had
no
impact
upon
the
defense
as
you
pointed
out
in
fahy.
it
had
no
impact
upon
the
corroboration
of
any
of
the
witnesses.
it
had
no
impact
upon
creating
any
possible
confessions
as
was
done
in
the
--
pointed
out
in
the
fahy
case.
it
had
none
of
these
effects.
and
essentially
the
only
fact
before
the
jury
was
as
i
seek
to
point
out
as
to
one
defendant
simply
a
question
of
intent.
and
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i'll
leave
that
question
before
my
associate.
but
let
me
say
this,
and
it
relates
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
the
other
day.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
the
application
of
the
harm
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
that
whether
it's
relevant
or
not,
the
harmless
error
rule
comprehends
the
concept
that
whatever
is
going
to
be
introduced
is
relevant
and
important
more
or
less
important.
if
any
and
if
--
you've
got
to
examine
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
my
case
i'd
say
it's
of
little
or
no
importance
in
the
--
on
context.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
like
--
i
say
that
it
did
not
have
any
reasonable
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
it
had
no
reasonable
possibility
of
having
contributed
to
this
conviction
to
use
your
words
your
honor
but
this
is
judgmental
and
you
must
examine
the
record.
for
example,
a
judge's
comment
as
in
bollenbach
made
at
the
time
that
the
jury
comes
back
in
and
is
hung
has
an
entirely
different
impact
even
though
it
may
be
the
same
error
that
occurs
early
in
the
trial
and
may
be
cured
by
subsequent
instructions.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
--
there
are
a
lot
of
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
certainly
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
our
position
if
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
immediate
point
is
that
it's
defensible
in
this
position.
it's
been
interpreted
to
mean
where
its
reasonable
probable
that'll
result
more
favorable
to
the
appealing
party
would
have
reached
--
than
reached
in
the
absent
of
the
error.
i
am
contending
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
say
absolutely
not.
i
say
that
of
course
were
dealing
with
words.
what
is
miscarriage
of
justice?
what
is
prejudice?
what
is
harm?
i
frankly
see
no
place
in
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
but
miscarriage
of
justice
means
what
the
sense
of
the
california
constitution
provision
with
the
california
con
--
supreme
court
says
it
means.
and
it
has
defined
it
in
the
watson
case
as
i
have
explained
to
you.
but
here
we
have
--
in
addition
we
have
his
--
we
had
teale's
confession
of
the
crime.
now,
this
comment
didn't
bring
about
that
confession.
he
confessed
first
degree
murder.
it's
in
the
record.
that
was
brought
out
not
tainted
by
any
doctrines
of
escobedo
or
messiah
or
any
other
doctrines,
voluntary
confession
to
a
fellow
prison.
now,
let's
examine
the
motes
case.
this
court
decided
that
some
years
back.
it
involved
the
question
of
conspiracy
under
the
civil
rights
action,
motes
versus
united
states.
the
def
--
the
--
one
of
the
codefendants,
mr.
taylor
took
the
stand
at
the
prelim
and
implicated
all
of
the
defendants.
he
was
however
not
produced
at
the
trial.
the
court
said
due
to
the
negligence
of
the
government
and
due
to
--
there
was
no
foundation
laid.
they
introduced
this
testimony
which
was
the
only
testimony
against
the
defendants
in
that
case.
this
court
said
that
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation.
however,
it
reversed
this
to
all
of
the
defendants
except
motes.
motes
took
the
stand
and
admitted
the
crime
seeking
to
exculpate
all
of
the
other
defendants.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
that
is
harmless
then
this
case
here
is
well
within
the
range.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
i
do
not.
i
had
simply
reached
this
by
--
i
thought
that
it'd
be
important
to
try
to
lay
some
foundation
of
the
facts
here
because
i
feared
i
would
never
get
to
it.
our
first
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
your
honor.
i
feel
that
that
is
not
a
federal
question
but
that's
a
second
question
asked.
i
attempted
to
answer
it.
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
in
error
of
this
kind,
there
is
no
federal
question.
we
base
this
on
the
other
concept
and
that
is
that
the
federal
question
of
course
is
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
clearly
a
federal
question
but
that
those
errors,
there
are
a
lot
of
errors
that
the
harmless
error
rule
does
not
even
purport
to
apply
to
and
i
think
those
cases
are
clearly
set
out
by
the
--
and
delineated
by
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
link
letter,
tehan
and
johnson.
the
distinction
that
this
court
makes
there
is
between
confessions,
publicity
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
counsel,
all
which
this
court
explains
as
being
--
as
going
to
the
very
fairness
of
the
trial
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process.
this
comment
by
the
prosecutor
did
not
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
as
you
said
in
tehan.
there
was
nothing
here
that
was
essentially
unfair
in
the
sense
of
the
tehan
case.
now,
if
it
were
a
counsel,
publicity,
confession
or
any
of
these
other
things
that
go
to
fairness
reliability
that
california
supreme
court
in
most
states
would
not
apply
a
harmless
error
rule
if
--
its
simply
not
applicable
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
in
this
kind
of
an
error,
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
what
this
court
said
in
tehan,
your
honor.
it
said
that
it
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
said
that
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
a
matter
of
fair
trial.
it
was
not
--
did
not
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
and
that's
the
reason
why
you
do
not
apply
it
to
mr.
brown
who
was
tried
a
week
before
chapman
and
teale
and
you
do
not
apply
it
to
mr.
smith
who
was
tried
a
week
after
chapman
and
teale
and
whose
appeal
have
become
final,
the
very
same
kind
of
comments.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
under
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
under
the
california
law,
it
would've
been
reversed
because
of
other
decisions
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
this
would
be
a
willful
misconduct
as
i
explained
to
you
yesterday.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
(inaudible)
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
it
does
not.
however,
if
they
sat
to
call
him
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
to
the
stand
then
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
the
point
i
have
been
attempting
to
make
is
that
if
this
case
sit
in
johnson,
you
must
examine
the
purpose
of
each
rule,
you
must
examine
its
peculiar
history,
and
its
impact
upon
the
administration
of
justice
in
determining
whether
or
not
that
error
is
subject
to
the
fair
trial
reliability
test
to
the
harmless
error
test.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
that
the
answer
there
is
that
it
would
--
that
it
does
not
go
to
fair
trial
and
--
under
tehan
until
you
get
back
to
the
point
where
you're
calling
them
to
the
stand
--
and
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
question
of
whether
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
that
there
is
a
federal
question.
the
federal
question
is
the
interpretation
of
course
of
the
fifth
amendment.
if
that
--
if
our
court
said
that
was
no
violation
clearly,
that's
a
federal
question.
but
if
our
court
says
that
that
is
not
harmful,
that
question
is
not
a
federal
question.
now
our
court
can
examine
to
determine
whether
--
what
effect
it
had.
now,
it
does
reach
the
point
and
you
can
give
me
an
example
i'm
sure
where
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
there's
no
relationship
between
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
it
is
our
contention
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
is
not
a
claim
of
fair
trial.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
it
is
not
a
claim
of
fair
trial
if
this
court
said
in
tehan,
it
isn't,
doesn't
go
the
reliability
you're
claiming
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
the
federal
question
--
we
say
that
if
in
fact
it
is
a
fair
trial
question,
counsel
question
or
any
of
those
confession
question
which
this
court
has
pointed
out
affects
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process.
there
you
can
apply
harmless
error
rule,
you
must
reverse.
but
if
it
does
not
present,
if
it's
one
of
these
categories,
that
does
not
affect
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
of
which
this
is
one,
then
the
state
can
apply
its
harmless
error
rule
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
subject
to
of
course
a
--
obviously
a
limitation
like
louisville
versus
thomson
where
there's
nothing
to
sustain
the
court's
conclusion.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
that's
not
what
they
said,
no.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
one
of
--
that's
correct,
that
what
we're
doing
here
--
this
is
a
rule
that
really
regulate
the
appellate
in
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
of
course
has
a
primary
responsibility
of
protecting
the
man's
rights
of
ruling
on
the
evidence.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
administer
justice,
to
examine
the
record,
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
any
harm.
the
constitution
does
not
say
or
require
that
you
have
an
error
on
its
trial.
it
requires
that
you
have
a
fair
trial.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
this
question
under
tehan
does
not
present
a
question
of
fair
trial,
as
defined
there
in
terms
of
something
that
affects
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process.
that's
what
we
are
saying.
we
are
saying
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
the
constitution
any
place
that
lays
down
a
requirement
that
the
state
reverse
the
case
where
there
has
not
been
a
denial
of
a
fair
trial
and
this
is
such
a
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
i
--
as
i
explained
that's
a
question
of
fair
trial.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
and
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
is
the
nature
of
the
defenses,
it's
immeasurable.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
to
the
contrary,
we
say
your
honor
that
that
goes
to
the
fair
--
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
fact
finding
process
and
he
is
now
automatically
reversed.
it's
not
even
covered
by
the
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
then
if
that's
true,
it
--
well,
of
course
we're
talking
about
evidence
but
then
if
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
how
could
we
--
how
could
you
even
have
the
doctrine
that
the
federal
courts
have
and
that
all
the
states
have
that
where
this
kind
of
error
happens,
the
indirect
comment,
you
can
cure
it
by
instruction.
indeed,
if
there
is
an
error,
you'd
have
to
reverse
regardless
of
the
--
any
curative
effect
of
instructions
but
the
answer
is
you
examine
the
error
in
the
context
of
the
case,
immediate
instructions
given,
the
effect
and
impact
upon
the
entire
case.
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
that
the
--
i
say
that
there's
a
federal
question
whether
or
not
he
broke
into
it.
i
say
there
is
a
federal
question
if
that
requires
that
the
state
had
--
its
state
have
a
rule
to
exclude
this
but
i
say
that
whether
or
not
there
was
a
--
was
harm
is
a
state
question
because
again
in
that
particular
instance
and
i
don't
purport
to
argue
that
question
here
but
again
we
contend
that
that
is
not
under
the
link
letter
case.
one
of
those
things
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
that
--
and
there's
a
clear
example
where
virtually
every
state,
virtually
every
circuit
with
some
exceptions
have
applied
a
doctrine
of
harmless
error,
a
judgmental
thing,
a
review
of
the
entire
proceeding.
it's
a
matter
of
wording.
as
rutledge
says,
you
can
word
it
literally
any
way
your
heart
desires
and
you
--
but
it
boils
down
to
a
judgment
factor.
this
of
course
requires
the
--
its
work,
its
hard
work
for
a
court
to
review
but
this
is
the
way
we
administer
justice
to
the
individual.
we
examine
to
see
whether
it
was
harmed
by
the
error.
we
simply
don't
look
at
the
error.
we
don't
and
this
of
course
raises
the
specter
as
we
expand
the
concepts
of
due
process
which
i
am
not
seeking
to
criticize
or
take
any
objection
but
as
we
expand
these
doctrines
we
get
further
removed
from
the
very
denial
as
here,
the
bringing
of
--
compelling
a
witness
to
testify
the
search.
we
introduced
indirect
comment
into
a
trial
that
may
have
no
effect
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
literally
no
effect.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what
do
you
mean
introduced
uncons
--
as
unconstitutionally?
i'm
not
quite
sure
if
you
mean
that
it
was
seek
--
search
evidence
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
your
honor,
i
have
never
said
that.
i
have
said
that
you
examine
the
particular
error
to
see
whether
or
not
that
particular
error
whether
it
be
introduction
of
evidence,
comment
or
any
other
violation,
to
examine
that
to
see
whether
or
not
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
of
course
this
court
ultimately.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but,
wait
a
minute,
the
issue
itself,
the
error
not
the
impact,
whether
the
error
is
of
a
kind
that
it
denied
fair
trial
in
the
sense
of
it
affected
the
reliability
of
the
truth
determining
processes,
then
we
don't
apply
harmless
error
but
if
it
didn't
effect
the
truth
determining
processes
as
this
comment
did
not
under
tahen
then
we
permit
the
courts
to
apply
a
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
yes
i
do
your
honor.
that,
we
have
so
contended
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
and
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
say
no
your
honor
but
i
leave
that
question
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
why?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well
most
--
if
you
take
that
argument
your
honor,
any
error
in
hearsay,
any
error
committed
presumably
is
going
to
be
designed
to
affect
the
course
of
the
trial.
any
relevant
evidence,
any
error
then
would
not
be
within
a
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
now
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
we
do
not.
our
courts
said
it
was
but
that's
another
question.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
right
but
we
say
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
we
say
it's
not
under
the
decision
of
this
court.
they
misapplied
but
that's
another
question.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
we
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
there
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
right,
no
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
go
ahead.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
the
federal
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
we
say
that.
we
say
that
--again
it
does
not
go
to
the
--
this
evidence
was
reliable.
it
didn't
infect,
fatally
infect
in
any
fashion
the
truthfulness,
the
truth
fact
finding
process.
in
fact,
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
obviously
there
are
--
that
extreme
case
where
the
--
number
one
i
do
not
assume
that
our
courts
or
any
courts
are
going
to
mis
--
deliberately
misapply
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
i
say
that
this
court
can
then
review
it
under
the
louisville
versus
thomson
doctrine.
if
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
between
the
state
and
if
there's
a
harmless
error
on
the
record
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
now
then
you
can
reach
it.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i'm
sorry.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
your
honor,
i
apologize.
i
shorthanded
that
louisville
analogy
but
i
was
attempting
to
say
and
not
accurately
apparently
and
that
is
that
there
--
you
do
arrive
at
a
case
where
the
state
would
--
that
misapplication
of
the
harmless
error
doctrine
would
be
so
bad,
let
us
say
that
all
men
would
virtually
agree
that
this
was
harmful
then
i
say
this
court
can
reach
it
as
it
did
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
you'll
reach
it
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
is
--
well,
you
reach
it
under
--
in
the
louisville
decision
which
was
--
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
which
was
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
i
said
that
i
have
not
made
my
analogy
clear
and
that
is
to
say
that
there
we
have
a
state
question
whether
or
not
there's
sufficient
evidence.
normally,
not
federal
question
at
all
--
is
that
not
--
that
is
correct.
this
court
doesn't
review
whether
or
not
this
case
or
any
--
virtually
any
case,
there's
sufficient
evidence.
however
there
is
that
case
where
the
state
misapplies,
grossly
misapplies
where
reasonable
men
cannot
really
disagree
that
there
is
no
evidence
and
i
say
in
that
kind
of
--
drawing
that
same
analogy
over
to
the
harmless
error,
i
say
you
reached
the
case
where
the
harmless
error
is
so
grossly
misapplied
that
this
court
could
then
review
it
but
not
in
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
--
the
--
i
say
that
generally
speaking
this
--
what
we're
dealing
here
is
a
very
fundamental
question
in
the
role
of
appellate
courts
in
relationship
to
trial
courts
and
in
the
role
of
the
entire
federal
system
to
state
courts
and
i
say
that
if
this
court
can
review
that
question
then
under
the
habeas
corpus
doctrines
the
district
courts
unless
if
the
state
issue
can
review
it.
i
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
every
affirmance
then,
it
becomes
subject
to
--
literally
subject
to
review
by
federal
courts.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
say,
they
can
in
all
cases
as
--
except
in
that
gross
misapplication,
they
cannot.
but
i
say
that
as
we
expand
that
the
concept
of
due
process
to
cover
many
technical
very
--
becomes
technical
error
in
the
sense
of
indirect
comment.
this
is
a
case
but
the
case
where
you
have
an
indirect
and
inadvertent
reference
to
the
fact
the
defendant
may
have
been
--
not
taken
the
stand.
has
no
bearing,
no
impact
upon
the
trial.
and
i
say
that
as
we
expand,
the
same
thing
is
true
in
search
and
seizure.
you
could
evidence
that
although
relevant
is
insignificant.
has
no
impact
upon
the
defense,
the
whole
proceedings
and
i
say
that
we're
in
great
danger
of
coming
back
to
the
situation
we
were
in
the
1890s
when
this
whole
reform,
when
the
harmless
error
was
brought
forth.
the
crises
and
public
crisis
in
the
confidence
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
this
court,
i
needn't
quote
pointed
this
out,
this
danger
in
the
snyder
versus
massachusetts.
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
it
out
in
a
couple
of
other
cases.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
how
much
time
do
i
have
left
your
honor?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course,
to
properly
concede
that
there
was
a
comment
and
instruction
that
comment
with
reference
to
both
defendants
was
in
violation
of
the
griffin
doctrine.
however,
before
i
go
into
the
matter
any
detail,
i
feel
that
in
light
of
the
statements
made
here
except
the
statement
of
counsel
the
tracking
of
earlier
statement.
i
feel
that
we
have
a
3000-page
record
here.
the
brief
is
replete
with
allegations
of
unfairness
and
i
would
like
to
correct
two
or
three
impressions
created
by
that
brief.
as
pointed
out
by
counsel,
he
is
correct
of
the
impression
that
the
district
attorney
here
and
the
trial
judge
deliberately
violated
the
doctrine
of
the
law
in
griffin.
this
case
was
tried
in
1963,
one
year
before
the
malloy
decision
came
down
and
two
years
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
griffin
versus
california.
those
comments
as
suggested
in
the
tehan
case
occurred
in
virtually
every
california
case
where
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
witness
stand.
this
is
one
of
those
cases.
those
statements
were
made
and
the
instruction
was
given
based
upon
50
years
of
constitutional
law
set
down
in
twine
and
in
adamson
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
trial
judge
and
the
counsel
followed
the
constitution
of
california
at
that
time.
secondly,
counsel
has
suggested
that
somehow
there
has
been
a
conspiracy
or
a
fraud
down
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
here
to
prevent
the
defendant
chapman
from
taking
the
witness
stand.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
absolutely.
if
this
happened
today,
we
will
have
entirely
different
case.
i
suggest
it
would
not
be
here.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
today,
your
honor,
i
--
there
would
be
no
comment.
obviously
that
practice
is
eliminated.
there
would
normally
be
an
instruction
akin
to
that
required
in
federal
practice.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
and
if
this
happen
today,
i
think
that
under
california
practice
we
would
have
a
--
the
case
would
not
be
here.
not
because
there
was
no
harm
but
before
a
different
state
policy
that
under
the
case
that
you've
cited
here,
the
case
of
people
versus
burnett
that
deliberate
and
flagrant
conduct
of
both
that
trial
counsel,
the
district
attorney
and
the
judge
would
be
misconduct
and
would
be
reversed.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
the
harmless
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
--
yes,
i
wish
to
make
that
argument.
i
was
simply
arguing
that
this
point
that
there
was
no
misconduct
that
but
that
is
an
argument
that
i
do
seek
to
pursue,
the
allegation
has
been
made
here
that
indeed
the
harmless
error
rule
has
been
applied
deliberately
by
the
california
courts
to
avoid
the
operation
of
griffin.
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs
cases
where
the
district
courts
of
appeal
or
intermediate
appellate
courts
in
fact
have
affirmed
convictions
where
commenting
in
violation
of
griffin
occur.
likewise,
we
have
brought
to
your
attention
some
dozen
cases
where
the
california
courts
have
reversed
those
convictions
because
it
found
the
comment
in
the
context
of
the
entire
case
to
be
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
to
be
a
--
to
be
prejudicial,
to
be
harmful
to
violate
our
harmless
error
rule.
likewise,
the
california
supreme
court
has
granted
here
in
cases
where
the
intermediate
appellate
courts
have
found
the
comment
to
be
harmless
and
affirmed.
so,
in
fact
there
was
no
deliberate
use
of
the
harmful
error
rule
to
undercut
the
decisions
of
this
court.
but
returning,
if
i
may,
to
the
general
allegation
that's
been
made
here
in
reference
to
the
conspiracy
to
keep
the
defendant
chapman
on
the
stand
the
allegations
that
somehow
the
--
she
was
denied
counsel.
there
was
a
denial
of
the
speedy
trial.
let
me
correct
that
record
before
we
discuss
the
real
questions
here.
under
california
practice,
award
was
based
upon
a
complaint.
mrs.
chapman
was
arrested
in
st.
joseph,
missouri
october
26,
1962.
she
was
brought
back
to
california,
the
record
shows
and
we
cited
it,
october
30,
1962.
the
record
reflects
that
she
was
arraigned
in
california
the
very
next
day,
october
31
or
she
was
advised
of
her
right
to
counsel
of
all
the
rights.
a
counsel
was
then
appointed,
immediately
appointed.
not
a
month
later
as
suggested
by
counsel.
and
the
same
sequence
occurred
in
reference
to
the
defendant
teale
when
he
was
brought
back
from
louisiana
and
of
course
after
the
initial
arraignment
instead
of
proceeding.
by
way
of
information,
that
case
was
brought
to
the
grand
jury
and
the
indictment
was
then
brought.
the
defendants
were
re-arraigned
on
november
16,
counsel
was
again
appointed
to
defend
them
in
that
indictment,
the
very
same
counsel
that
had
been
appointed
on
the
earlier
dates.
finally,
there's
an
allegation
here
that
the
defendant
--
that
the
prosecutor
here
kept
the
defendant
chapman
from
taking
the
stand
by
virtue
of
the
delays,
by
virtue
of
--
this
was
part
of
his
tactic.
but
i
think
that
if
you
examine
this
record
you
will
see
very
plainly
that
the
trial
dates,
the
times
and
the
trial
dates
were
agreed
to
by
her
counsel
that
it
was
suggested
shortly
before
the
first
trial
date
that
there
was
a
conflict
that
the
public
between
the
two
defendants
and
the
public
defendant
could
not
properly
represent
both.
the
court
immediately
appointed
separate
counsel
for
mrs.
chapman.
shortly
thereafter
and
a
new
trial
date
was
again
selected
about
a
month
forward,
the
defendant
chapman
filed
an
affidavit
alleging
in
demanding
in
support
of
a
motion
for
a
separate
trial
alleging
that
the
public
defender
had
special
knowledge
which
could
be
used
in
cross
examining
her.
the
judge
then
denied
the
motion
for
a
separate
trial
and
appointed
new
counsel
for
the
defendant
teale.
the
matter
was
then
delayed
for
another
month
in
order
that
that
counsel
could
properly
prepare
and
defend
the
case.
finally,
there's
an
allegation
that
somehow
made
here
again
in
argument
that
the
prosecutor
sought
to
get
her
statement
which
she
said
--
he
said
was
taken
without
counsel.
the
record
reflects
in
fact
that
what
he
is
referring
to
appears
to
be
statement
which
the
defendant
introduced
via
the
testimony
of
a
psychiatrist
and
i
think
important
to
this
entire
case
is
the
defense
and
this
goes
to
the
defense
of
mrs.
chapman.
mrs.
chapman's
defense
was
from
the
very
outset
in
this
case
that
she
was
present
in
all
times,
that
she
did
not,
however,
have
the
specific
intent.
now,
the
--
in
california
or
practices
for
the
prosecutor
to
make
an
opening
statement
present
his
testimony,
the
defense
counsel
to
make
his
opening
statement
and
to
present
his
testimony.
however,
in
this
case,
after
the
prosecutor
had
made
his
opening
statement,
defense
counsel
requested
opportunity
to
make
his
opening
statement
out
of
term
and
the
judge
granted
that.
he
then
stated
as
his
defense
in
fact
in
admission
of
her
presence
at
the
scene
of
the
robbery,
that
kidnapping
and
the
murder.
the
defense
then
established
through
that
the
psychiatrist
not
dr.
winkler
but
dr.
sherman,
the
defense
psychiatrist
that
she
did
not
or
possibly
had
a
hysterical
alcoholic
blackout,
disassociated
status
the
psychiatrist
say
that
she
could
not
formulate
the
specific
intent
to
commit
these
crimes
but
as
a
part
of
that
basis
for
the
psychiatrist's
opinion,
the
psychiatrist
testifies
both
as
to
what
she
had
told
them
and
over
objection
by
the
prosecution.
defense
counsel
read
a
statement
which
she
gave
or
read
great
portions
of
the
statement
which
he
had
previously
given
to
the
deputy
district
attorney.
there
is
no
foundation.
the
statement
was
at
no
time
offered
by
the
prosecution.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
the
background
for
the
taking
of
the
statement.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
doctor
winkler
was
called
--
well,
there's
an
allegation
here
that
this
was
a
conspiracy
and
that
in
fact
there's
a
ball
of
statement
made
that
the
calling
of
dr.
winkler
and
the
presenting
of
his
testimony
violates
griffin.
dr.
winkler
was
simply
called
then
in
rebuttal.
and
further
i
think
it
is
important
of
course
in
any
event
that
we
must
examine
the
entire
record,
the
entire
case
and
not
merely
as
counsel
for
petitioner
has
asserted
that
we
look
at
the
--
only
at
the
statements
made
here,
the
instruction
given
or
the
comment
made
and
determined
from
that
whether
or
not
there
was
harm.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
your
honor.
that
is
not
what
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
not
the
rule
in
california.
you
must
examine
the
entire
cause.
you
must
look
at
the
error
in
the
context
of
the
entire
cause.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
harm
to
this
particular
defense.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
the
california
constitution
speaks
in
terms
of
examination
of
the
entire
record
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
however,
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
people
versus
watson,
set
down
the
rule
that
what
this
means
is
that
we
must
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
reasonably
probable
that
the
errors
complained
of
would
not
have
led
to
a
different
result.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
if
this
court
suggested
in
tehan,
this
can
correct
me
so
that
this
has
happened
virtually
in
every
case.
it
becomes
a
courtroom
dramatics.
it's
the
dramatic
impact
that
here
we've
established
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
of
course.
of
course
it
doesn't
hurt
that
case
and
there's
no
--
it
doesn't
know
in
that
sense.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
might
although
i
suggest
that
they
--
that
you're
correct
that
they
believe
that
it
has
some
effect
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
certainly.
certainly,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
in
fact
that
helps
me
if
they
need
it
on
the
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
you
--
many
your
opinion
suggests
that
you
do.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
would
now
like
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
did
not
follow
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
but
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
would
make
this
distinction
that
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
statement
made
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
our
reason
for
saying
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
i
say
that
two
things.
first
of
all,
of
course
the
judge
did
instruct
them
and
that
this
is
an
influence
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
there
was
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
pe
--
that
the
people
must
prove
their
case
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
no
presumption
of
guilt
as
a
result
of
the
failure
of
the
defendants
to
testify.
as
far
as
in
the
second
part
of
it,
of
course
it
is
our
contention
you
must
examine
the
particular
error
in
the
light
of
everything
that
happened
here.
in
other
words,
the
point
that
i
was
making
i
need
not
repeat
now
earlier
was
that
here
we
have
this
particular
defense
of
the
defendant
chapman
for
example.
really,
the
defense
was
that
she
blocked
out,
not
that
she
wasn't
there
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
there
was
nothing
--
you
cannot
infer
her
guilt.
you
can
simply,
in
a
given
set
of
circumstances
where
the
defendant
might
have
had
some
information,
the
jury
where
they
can
draw
private
different
inferences
may
take
the
inference
against
that
particular
--
that
defendant
who
did
not
testify
but
as
to
a
particular
item
of
proof
and
not
that
you
can
infer
her
guilt.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
yes.
but
and
not
that
you
can
infer
her
guilt,
not
that
you
--
that
it's
proof
of
presumption
of
guilt
but
simply
has
related
to
a
particular
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
piece
of
evidence.
as
i
said
here,
with
the
defense
really
is
block
out,
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
commented
that
she
could
explain
why
she
purchased
those
guns
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
certainly
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
this
--
certainly
she
had
a
right
not
to
but
this
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
how
do
i
make
that
harmless
error?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
--
i
examine
the
entire
record
and
see
what
effect
this
has.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
that's
not
the
mere
test.
not
simply
that
she's
guilty
but
whether
or
not
whether
she
reasonably
probable
that
the
error
complained
of
would
have
brought
about
the
different
result.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
it's
not
simply
weighing
of
--
it's
not
simply
the
weighing
of
evidence
of
guilt
but
if
in
fact
that
error
assisted
in
bringing
about
that
verdict
to
that
result.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i'm
suggesting
that
it
did
not
--
not
reasonably
probable
that
it
had
any.
i'm
arguing
that
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
that
it
affected
the
trial
in
light
of
the
entire
evidence
in
this
case,
in
light
of
the
entire
proceeding
for
defense
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
of
course
that
bring
us
back
to
another
argument
and
it
is
been
suggested
in
the
dissents
in
the
earlier
cases
that
there
is
some
question
as
to
the
influence
of
the
jury.
the
fact
that
she
did
not
testify
and
he
did
not
testify
is
a
fact
that
the
jury
is
aware
of
that
they're
going
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
and
the
fact
that
we
have
carefully
controlled
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
of
course
this
goes
back
to
the
policies
behind
griffin
that
then
i
can
see
but
this
is
simply
a
fact
that
the
jury
is
well
aware
of,
one
which
they
may
naturally
whether
instructed
or
uninstructed
where
the
comment
is
made
or
not
are
going
to
have
in
their
mind
or
practice
specifically
instructs
them
how
they
must
limit
that
fact
that
they
can
draw
no
presumption
of
guilt,
that
they
--
that
the
people
have
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
now,
the
counsel
here
for
the
petitioner
draws
an
analogy
to
confession
cases.
they
say
that
those
cases
established
that
you
must
reverse
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
but
i
think
this
leads
us
to
in
to
the
very
problem
that
we're
concerned
with
and
that
is,
what
is
the
impact
of
these
statements
as
opposed
to
the
impact
of
a
confession.
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
confessions
are
--
when
introduced
result
in
reversal
has
a
result
of
the
pervasive
impact
that
it
has
and
secondly
because
it
impairs
the
very
fairness
of
the
fact
finding
procedure,
the
fairness
of
the
trial
the
very
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
procedure.
now,
the
court
--
this
court,
the
tehan
case
stated
that
the
comment
did
not
in
fact
impair
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
there's
no
--
they
didn't
get
any
evidence
but
there's
no
question
that
was
done
here
was
in
violation
of
the
griffin
rule.
no
question
about
that.
but
as
you
said
in
tehan,
determine
the
question
of
retroactivity
this
did
not
impair
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
processes
the
trial
court.
it's
our
contention
that
the
same
kind
of
analogy
can
and
must
be
draw
in
determining
whether
a
particular
constitutional
defect
is
to
be
subjected
to
the
harmless
error
rule.
it's
our
contention
that
harmless
error
rule
is
applicable
to
all
errors
constitutional
or
not
except
those
errors
that
impair
the
fairness
of
the
trial
that
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
processes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
we
take
the
position
that
this
is
a
question
of
state
law
and
not
a
constitutional
law.
we
take
the
position
that
you
must
examine
the
policies
of
the
rule
that
the
reason
for
the
rule
and
that
this
is
an
area
where
federalism
properly
has
applied
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
harmful
is
not
a
federal
question
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
except
it
we
take
the
case
like
louisville
versus
thompson.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
as
long
as
the
--
it's
our
position
that
is
long
as
the
state
standard,
the
state
rule
protects
what
we
call
fairness
that
to
say,
protects
those
rights
that
ensure
of
fair
trial
those
rights
that
are
related
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
that
that
states
must
reverse
but
as
to
any
other
error
then
it
can
properly
apply
its
own
standard
as
a
question
of
state
law
and
again
except
in
a
extreme
case
where
there's
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
application
of
that
rule
to
the
facts
of
that
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
harm
involved
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
your
honor.
if
that
case
--
this
case
were
tried
yesterday
and
were
then
presented
in
the
california
supreme
court
today,
it
would
be
reversed
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
would
be
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
because
under
california
law,
there
are
other
factors
because
if
these
were
done
today,
it
would
not
be
merely
a
violation
of
the
griffin
doctrine.
it
would
be
deliberate
flagrant
misconduct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
trial
judge
in
the
prosecutor
and
under
burnett
would
be
reversed.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
--
there
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
we
are
looking
--
we're
looking
beyond
harm
really.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
it
--
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
we
left
on
the
note
of
why
do
we
look
at
the
entire
record.
under
any
test
regardless
of
how
it
is
defined
it's
a
question
of
judgment,
its
judgmental,
as
just
--
justice
rutledge
said
in
the
koteakos
case,
you
must
examine
the
entire
proceeding.
this
case
said
is
fahy
versus
connecticut,
you
must
examine
the
impact
of
that
error
not
examine
the
error
alone
but
the
impact
of
that
error
upon
the
entire
case
to
see
whether
or
not
it
--
in
that
test,
was
reasonably
possible
that
it
contributed
to
the
conviction.
doesn't
matter
how
you
word
it,
that's
another
problem.
that
case,
there
was
illegally
obtained
evidence
introduced,
the
paint
in
the
brushes.
the
court
pointed
out
there
that
this
had
a
serious
impact
of
the
--
the
brush
marks
were
identified
as
being
identical
with
that
paint
--
painted
the
swastika.
the
paint
and
the
bucket
were
found
in
the
car
which
was
seen
near
the
scene.
the
court
pointed
out
that
in
fact
the
confrontation
of
this
illegal
evidence
probably
led
to
the
confession
that
was
introduced.
it
pointed
to
the
impact
of
that
testimony
upon
the
defense
concluding
that
it
probably
brought
about
the
presentation
of
the
defendant,
putting
the
defendant
on
the
stand.
now
what
is
the
impact
of
a
comment
hereupon
this
case?
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
none
when
you
examine
the
record
in
this
case.
it
had
none
of
these
factors
that
the
court
pointed
to
in
fahy.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
a
robbery,
murder
and
kidnapping
of
a
bartender
in
lodi.
the
evidence
although
the
petitioners
contend
that
there
was
no
evidence.
there
were
three
or
four
exhibits
not
introduced
but
the
story
is
a
very
simple
one.
there
was
conspiracy
between
mrs.
chapman
and
mr.
teale.
they
were
seeing
together
for
a
period
of
--
they
lived
together
for
a
period,
they
left
a
city
in
california
on
october
10,
they
went
to
reno.
there
she
purchased
a
--
which
turned
out
later
to
be
a
very
peculiar
22
automatic,
and
a
32.
thereafter
they
were
registered
jointly
in
a
motel
in
fresno
not
100
miles
below
the
scene
of
the
crime,
the
very
day
before
the
robbery,
kidnapping
and
murder.
he
signed
the
registration,
she
signed
would
turned
out
to
be
a
bad
check.
they
were
identified.
there
was
expert
testimony
all
the
way
through
as
to
the
signatures.
thereafter
that
evening,
they
were
seen
in
a
bar
called
--
bar
and
restaurant
called
croce's
in
city
of
lodi.
they
were
there
from
about
ten
until
shortly
after
one
o'clock.
there
were
various
things
that
occurred
there,
there
was
a
lot
of
discussions
but
they
were
positively
identified
there.
they
were
positively
established
that
they
were
driving
the
same
61
ford
that's
--
goes
throughout
the
proceedings.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
left
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
sir,
your
honor.
i
just
thought
that
i
had
point
out
--
pointed
out
to
you
that
what
we
are
doing
is
examining
to
see
what
impact
that
error
had.
rather
that
its
--
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
provision,
grievous
error
and
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
error
which
at
the
time
committed
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
--
it
--
those
are
different
concepts.
prejudicial
and
harmful
is
not
necessarily
grievous
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
--
there's
plain
error
instead
of
grievous.
i
extract
the
word
if
you
are
going
to
equate
it
to
harmless
or
prejudicial.
we're
talking
about
words
but
essentially
it's
judgmental.
they
went
into
the
--
they
left
this
bar.
mrs.
chapman
said,
“we
can't
do
anything
in
here,
let's
go.”
few
minutes
later
they
entered
the
bar
of
the
victim.
they
are
positively
identified
in
that
bar,
both
of
these
people
that
witnesses
point
out
that
in
fact
they
were
the
last
people
in
that
bar
when
the
bar
closed.
a
driver
who
had
been
--
knew
the
bartender
driving
a
truck
late
at
night
saw
and
identified
that
bartender
locking
the
door,
saw
a
man
and
a
woman
meeting
the
description
of
the
defendants
here
near
--
one
of
them
immediately
behind
him
and
the
other
one
nearer.
thereafter
the
next
morning
in
the
county
of
sacramento,
a
short
distance
away,
a
body
was
found,
the
body
of
the
victim.
he's
been
robbed,
his
wallet,
its
contents
thrown
around
and
underneath
the
body
is
--
found
a
check,
says,
“refer
to
maker”,
signed
by
mrs.
chapman.
and
the
time
of
death
as
established
by
the
coroner
and
the
experts
to
be
three
o'clock,
the
shooting
about
two
thirty.
this
witness
--
the
defendants
here
then
show
up
in
davis,
four
thirty
of
that
very
morning
and
register
under
the
false
of
kiel
rosenthal,
giving
a
false
license
plate
which
the
court
corrected.
thereafter
they
fled
the
state
of
california,
went
to
missouri
and
went
to
louisiana.
now,
as
to
teale,
when
he
was
arrested
in
louisiana
in
her
car,
the
very
car
used
in
the
murder
as
it's
established,
identified
with
the
(inaudible)
along.
he
is
brought
back
to
california.
he
makes
an
admission
there
about
lodi
to
the
fbi
agent.
he's
brought
back
to
california.
the
car
is
examined.
they
find
fibers
on
the
feet
of
the
victim
which
match
the
fibers
of
the
floorboard
of
the
car,
fibers
in
the
mat
of
the
car,
fibers
from
the
clothing
of
the
--
of
mrs.
chapman.
they
find
blood
pattern
that
--
the
same
type
of
the
victim's
in
the
automobile.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
find
that
the
defendant's
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
hair
on
the
shoes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
will
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
your
honor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what
i'm
saying
is
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
that
when
i
finish
my
recitation,
i
hope
to
convince
you
that
the
comment
had
nothing
to
do,
literally
nothing
to
do
or
certainly
no
reasonable
possibility
that
it
affect
of
the
outcome.
now
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
why?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
because
there
is
no
--
there
is
not
the
kind
of
things
that
had
no
impact
upon
the
defense
as
you
pointed
out
in
fahy.
it
had
no
impact
upon
the
corroboration
of
any
of
the
witnesses.
it
had
no
impact
upon
creating
any
possible
confessions
as
was
done
in
the
--
pointed
out
in
the
fahy
case.
it
had
none
of
these
effects.
and
essentially
the
only
fact
before
the
jury
was
as
i
seek
to
point
out
as
to
one
defendant
simply
a
question
of
intent.
and
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i'll
leave
that
question
before
my
associate.
but
let
me
say
this,
and
it
relates
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
the
other
day.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
the
application
of
the
harm
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
that
whether
it's
relevant
or
not,
the
harmless
error
rule
comprehends
the
concept
that
whatever
is
going
to
be
introduced
is
relevant
and
important
more
or
less
important.
if
any
and
if
--
you've
got
to
examine
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
my
case
i'd
say
it's
of
little
or
no
importance
in
the
--
on
context.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
like
--
i
say
that
it
did
not
have
any
reasonable
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
it
had
no
reasonable
possibility
of
having
contributed
to
this
conviction
to
use
your
words
your
honor
but
this
is
judgmental
and
you
must
examine
the
record.
for
example,
a
judge's
comment
as
in
bollenbach
made
at
the
time
that
the
jury
comes
back
in
and
is
hung
has
an
entirely
different
impact
even
though
it
may
be
the
same
error
that
occurs
early
in
the
trial
and
may
be
cured
by
subsequent
instructions.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
--
there
are
a
lot
of
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
certainly
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
our
position
if
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
immediate
point
is
that
it's
defensible
in
this
position.
it's
been
interpreted
to
mean
where
its
reasonable
probable
that'll
result
more
favorable
to
the
appealing
party
would
have
reached
--
than
reached
in
the
absent
of
the
error.
i
am
contending
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
say
absolutely
not.
i
say
that
of
course
were
dealing
with
words.
what
is
miscarriage
of
justice?
what
is
prejudice?
what
is
harm?
i
frankly
see
no
place
in
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
but
miscarriage
of
justice
means
what
the
sense
of
the
california
constitution
provision
with
the
california
con
--
supreme
court
says
it
means.
and
it
has
defined
it
in
the
watson
case
as
i
have
explained
to
you.
but
here
we
have
--
in
addition
we
have
his
--
we
had
teale's
confession
of
the
crime.
now,
this
comment
didn't
bring
about
that
confession.
he
confessed
first
degree
murder.
it's
in
the
record.
that
was
brought
out
not
tainted
by
any
doctrines
of
escobedo
or
messiah
or
any
other
doctrines,
voluntary
confession
to
a
fellow
prison.
now,
let's
examine
the
motes
case.
this
court
decided
that
some
years
back.
it
involved
the
question
of
conspiracy
under
the
civil
rights
action,
motes
versus
united
states.
the
def
--
the
--
one
of
the
codefendants,
mr.
taylor
took
the
stand
at
the
prelim
and
implicated
all
of
the
defendants.
he
was
however
not
produced
at
the
trial.
the
court
said
due
to
the
negligence
of
the
government
and
due
to
--
there
was
no
foundation
laid.
they
introduced
this
testimony
which
was
the
only
testimony
against
the
defendants
in
that
case.
this
court
said
that
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation.
however,
it
reversed
this
to
all
of
the
defendants
except
motes.
motes
took
the
stand
and
admitted
the
crime
seeking
to
exculpate
all
of
the
other
defendants.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
that
is
harmless
then
this
case
here
is
well
within
the
range.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
i
do
not.
i
had
simply
reached
this
by
--
i
thought
that
it'd
be
important
to
try
to
lay
some
foundation
of
the
facts
here
because
i
feared
i
would
never
get
to
it.
our
first
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
your
honor.
i
feel
that
that
is
not
a
federal
question
but
that's
a
second
question
asked.
i
attempted
to
answer
it.
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
in
error
of
this
kind,
there
is
no
federal
question.
we
base
this
on
the
other
concept
and
that
is
that
the
federal
question
of
course
is
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
clearly
a
federal
question
but
that
those
errors,
there
are
a
lot
of
errors
that
the
harmless
error
rule
does
not
even
purport
to
apply
to
and
i
think
those
cases
are
clearly
set
out
by
the
--
and
delineated
by
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
link
letter,
tehan
and
johnson.
the
distinction
that
this
court
makes
there
is
between
confessions,
publicity
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
counsel,
all
which
this
court
explains
as
being
--
as
going
to
the
very
fairness
of
the
trial
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process.
this
comment
by
the
prosecutor
did
not
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
as
you
said
in
tehan.
there
was
nothing
here
that
was
essentially
unfair
in
the
sense
of
the
tehan
case.
now,
if
it
were
a
counsel,
publicity,
confession
or
any
of
these
other
things
that
go
to
fairness
reliability
that
california
supreme
court
in
most
states
would
not
apply
a
harmless
error
rule
if
--
its
simply
not
applicable
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
in
this
kind
of
an
error,
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
what
this
court
said
in
tehan,
your
honor.
it
said
that
it
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
said
that
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
a
matter
of
fair
trial.
it
was
not
--
did
not
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
and
that's
the
reason
why
you
do
not
apply
it
to
mr.
brown
who
was
tried
a
week
before
chapman
and
teale
and
you
do
not
apply
it
to
mr.
smith
who
was
tried
a
week
after
chapman
and
teale
and
whose
appeal
have
become
final,
the
very
same
kind
of
comments.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
under
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
under
the
california
law,
it
would've
been
reversed
because
of
other
decisions
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
this
would
be
a
willful
misconduct
as
i
explained
to
you
yesterday.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
(inaudible)
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
it
does
not.
however,
if
they
sat
to
call
him
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
to
the
stand
then
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
think
that
the
point
i
have
been
attempting
to
make
is
that
if
this
case
sit
in
johnson,
you
must
examine
the
purpose
of
each
rule,
you
must
examine
its
peculiar
history,
and
its
impact
upon
the
administration
of
justice
in
determining
whether
or
not
that
error
is
subject
to
the
fair
trial
reliability
test
to
the
harmless
error
test.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
that
the
answer
there
is
that
it
would
--
that
it
does
not
go
to
fair
trial
and
--
under
tehan
until
you
get
back
to
the
point
where
you're
calling
them
to
the
stand
--
and
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
question
of
whether
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
that
there
is
a
federal
question.
the
federal
question
is
the
interpretation
of
course
of
the
fifth
amendment.
if
that
--
if
our
court
said
that
was
no
violation
clearly,
that's
a
federal
question.
but
if
our
court
says
that
that
is
not
harmful,
that
question
is
not
a
federal
question.
now
our
court
can
examine
to
determine
whether
--
what
effect
it
had.
now,
it
does
reach
the
point
and
you
can
give
me
an
example
i'm
sure
where
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
there's
no
relationship
between
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
it
is
our
contention
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
is
not
a
claim
of
fair
trial.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
it
is
not
a
claim
of
fair
trial
if
this
court
said
in
tehan,
it
isn't,
doesn't
go
the
reliability
you're
claiming
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
the
federal
question
--
we
say
that
if
in
fact
it
is
a
fair
trial
question,
counsel
question
or
any
of
those
confession
question
which
this
court
has
pointed
out
affects
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process.
there
you
can
apply
harmless
error
rule,
you
must
reverse.
but
if
it
does
not
present,
if
it's
one
of
these
categories,
that
does
not
affect
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
of
which
this
is
one,
then
the
state
can
apply
its
harmless
error
rule
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
subject
to
of
course
a
--
obviously
a
limitation
like
louisville
versus
thomson
where
there's
nothing
to
sustain
the
court's
conclusion.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
that's
not
what
they
said,
no.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
one
of
--
that's
correct,
that
what
we're
doing
here
--
this
is
a
rule
that
really
regulate
the
appellate
in
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
of
course
has
a
primary
responsibility
of
protecting
the
man's
rights
of
ruling
on
the
evidence.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
administer
justice,
to
examine
the
record,
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
any
harm.
the
constitution
does
not
say
or
require
that
you
have
an
error
on
its
trial.
it
requires
that
you
have
a
fair
trial.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
this
question
under
tehan
does
not
present
a
question
of
fair
trial,
as
defined
there
in
terms
of
something
that
affects
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process.
that's
what
we
are
saying.
we
are
saying
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
the
constitution
any
place
that
lays
down
a
requirement
that
the
state
reverse
the
case
where
there
has
not
been
a
denial
of
a
fair
trial
and
this
is
such
a
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
i
--
as
i
explained
that's
a
question
of
fair
trial.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
and
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
is
the
nature
of
the
defenses,
it's
immeasurable.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
to
the
contrary,
we
say
your
honor
that
that
goes
to
the
fair
--
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
fact
finding
process
and
he
is
now
automatically
reversed.
it's
not
even
covered
by
the
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
then
if
that's
true,
it
--
well,
of
course
we're
talking
about
evidence
but
then
if
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
how
could
we
--
how
could
you
even
have
the
doctrine
that
the
federal
courts
have
and
that
all
the
states
have
that
where
this
kind
of
error
happens,
the
indirect
comment,
you
can
cure
it
by
instruction.
indeed,
if
there
is
an
error,
you'd
have
to
reverse
regardless
of
the
--
any
curative
effect
of
instructions
but
the
answer
is
you
examine
the
error
in
the
context
of
the
case,
immediate
instructions
given,
the
effect
and
impact
upon
the
entire
case.
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
that
the
--
i
say
that
there's
a
federal
question
whether
or
not
he
broke
into
it.
i
say
there
is
a
federal
question
if
that
requires
that
the
state
had
--
its
state
have
a
rule
to
exclude
this
but
i
say
that
whether
or
not
there
was
a
--
was
harm
is
a
state
question
because
again
in
that
particular
instance
and
i
don't
purport
to
argue
that
question
here
but
again
we
contend
that
that
is
not
under
the
link
letter
case.
one
of
those
things
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
that
--
and
there's
a
clear
example
where
virtually
every
state,
virtually
every
circuit
with
some
exceptions
have
applied
a
doctrine
of
harmless
error,
a
judgmental
thing,
a
review
of
the
entire
proceeding.
it's
a
matter
of
wording.
as
rutledge
says,
you
can
word
it
literally
any
way
your
heart
desires
and
you
--
but
it
boils
down
to
a
judgment
factor.
this
of
course
requires
the
--
its
work,
its
hard
work
for
a
court
to
review
but
this
is
the
way
we
administer
justice
to
the
individual.
we
examine
to
see
whether
it
was
harmed
by
the
error.
we
simply
don't
look
at
the
error.
we
don't
and
this
of
course
raises
the
specter
as
we
expand
the
concepts
of
due
process
which
i
am
not
seeking
to
criticize
or
take
any
objection
but
as
we
expand
these
doctrines
we
get
further
removed
from
the
very
denial
as
here,
the
bringing
of
--
compelling
a
witness
to
testify
the
search.
we
introduced
indirect
comment
into
a
trial
that
may
have
no
effect
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
literally
no
effect.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what
do
you
mean
introduced
uncons
--
as
unconstitutionally?
i'm
not
quite
sure
if
you
mean
that
it
was
seek
--
search
evidence
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
your
honor,
i
have
never
said
that.
i
have
said
that
you
examine
the
particular
error
to
see
whether
or
not
that
particular
error
whether
it
be
introduction
of
evidence,
comment
or
any
other
violation,
to
examine
that
to
see
whether
or
not
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
of
course
this
court
ultimately.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but,
wait
a
minute,
the
issue
itself,
the
error
not
the
impact,
whether
the
error
is
of
a
kind
that
it
denied
fair
trial
in
the
sense
of
it
affected
the
reliability
of
the
truth
determining
processes,
then
we
don't
apply
harmless
error
but
if
it
didn't
effect
the
truth
determining
processes
as
this
comment
did
not
under
tahen
then
we
permit
the
courts
to
apply
a
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
yes
i
do
your
honor.
that,
we
have
so
contended
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
and
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
say
no
your
honor
but
i
leave
that
question
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
why?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well
most
--
if
you
take
that
argument
your
honor,
any
error
in
hearsay,
any
error
committed
presumably
is
going
to
be
designed
to
affect
the
course
of
the
trial.
any
relevant
evidence,
any
error
then
would
not
be
within
a
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
now
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
we
do
not.
our
courts
said
it
was
but
that's
another
question.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
right
but
we
say
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
we
say
it's
not
under
the
decision
of
this
court.
they
misapplied
but
that's
another
question.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
we
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
there
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
right,
no
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
go
ahead.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
the
federal
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
we
say
that.
we
say
that
--again
it
does
not
go
to
the
--
this
evidence
was
reliable.
it
didn't
infect,
fatally
infect
in
any
fashion
the
truthfulness,
the
truth
fact
finding
process.
in
fact,
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
obviously
there
are
--
that
extreme
case
where
the
--
number
one
i
do
not
assume
that
our
courts
or
any
courts
are
going
to
mis
--
deliberately
misapply
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
i
say
that
this
court
can
then
review
it
under
the
louisville
versus
thomson
doctrine.
if
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
between
the
state
and
if
there's
a
harmless
error
on
the
record
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
now
then
you
can
reach
it.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i'm
sorry.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
your
honor,
i
apologize.
i
shorthanded
that
louisville
analogy
but
i
was
attempting
to
say
and
not
accurately
apparently
and
that
is
that
there
--
you
do
arrive
at
a
case
where
the
state
would
--
that
misapplication
of
the
harmless
error
doctrine
would
be
so
bad,
let
us
say
that
all
men
would
virtually
agree
that
this
was
harmful
then
i
say
this
court
can
reach
it
as
it
did
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
you'll
reach
it
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
is
--
well,
you
reach
it
under
--
in
the
louisville
decision
which
was
--
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
which
was
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
i
said
that
i
have
not
made
my
analogy
clear
and
that
is
to
say
that
there
we
have
a
state
question
whether
or
not
there's
sufficient
evidence.
normally,
not
federal
question
at
all
--
is
that
not
--
that
is
correct.
this
court
doesn't
review
whether
or
not
this
case
or
any
--
virtually
any
case,
there's
sufficient
evidence.
however
there
is
that
case
where
the
state
misapplies,
grossly
misapplies
where
reasonable
men
cannot
really
disagree
that
there
is
no
evidence
and
i
say
in
that
kind
of
--
drawing
that
same
analogy
over
to
the
harmless
error,
i
say
you
reached
the
case
where
the
harmless
error
is
so
grossly
misapplied
that
this
court
could
then
review
it
but
not
in
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
--
the
--
i
say
that
generally
speaking
this
--
what
we're
dealing
here
is
a
very
fundamental
question
in
the
role
of
appellate
courts
in
relationship
to
trial
courts
and
in
the
role
of
the
entire
federal
system
to
state
courts
and
i
say
that
if
this
court
can
review
that
question
then
under
the
habeas
corpus
doctrines
the
district
courts
unless
if
the
state
issue
can
review
it.
i
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
every
affirmance
then,
it
becomes
subject
to
--
literally
subject
to
review
by
federal
courts.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
say,
they
can
in
all
cases
as
--
except
in
that
gross
misapplication,
they
cannot.
but
i
say
that
as
we
expand
that
the
concept
of
due
process
to
cover
many
technical
very
--
becomes
technical
error
in
the
sense
of
indirect
comment.
this
is
a
case
but
the
case
where
you
have
an
indirect
and
inadvertent
reference
to
the
fact
the
defendant
may
have
been
--
not
taken
the
stand.
has
no
bearing,
no
impact
upon
the
trial.
and
i
say
that
as
we
expand,
the
same
thing
is
true
in
search
and
seizure.
you
could
evidence
that
although
relevant
is
insignificant.
has
no
impact
upon
the
defense,
the
whole
proceedings
and
i
say
that
we're
in
great
danger
of
coming
back
to
the
situation
we
were
in
the
1890s
when
this
whole
reform,
when
the
harmless
error
was
brought
forth.
the
crises
and
public
crisis
in
the
confidence
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
this
court,
i
needn't
quote
pointed
this
out,
this
danger
in
the
snyder
versus
massachusetts.
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
it
out
in
a
couple
of
other
cases.
thank
you
very
much.
