justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
mr.
lavine
that
as
i
understandyou
to
it
defendant,
you're
arguing
that
it
can
never
be
harmless
error
even
though
it
was
a
very,
very,
very
slight
incontestable
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
that,
are
you
going
that
extent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
argue
that
any
time
it's
shown
that
that
is
done,
can
make
any
difference
of
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isolated
now,
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
can't
be
held
to
be
an
isolated
under
the
requirement
even
though
anybody
could
look
at
it
and
tell
beyond
any
shadow
of
doubt
that
it
was
harmed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
because
you
say
that
any
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
without
regard
to
its
significant
indication,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
in.
with
that
regard
to
which
significant
in
a
case
has
to
be
held
harmful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
be
held
harmful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
cannot
be
held
harmful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
you
wouldn't
answer
it.
you've
just
got
to
answer
from
reading
what
somebody
said.
i
don't
care
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
argue
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
argue
with
me
at
all.
i
just
want
to
find
out
if
that's
what
you're
arguing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
not
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
joining
issue
with
you,
i
just
trying
to
see
if
that
what
you're
arguing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not
arguing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
question
of
harmless
error
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
else
was
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
else
was
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
it
but
you
stopped
before
you
said
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
case
indicated,
did
it
not?
we
didn't
think
it
whether
it's
harmless
--
that
we
didn't
make
error
was
harmless.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
we
have
argued
it
anyway
if
it's
settled
in
the
fact
that
the
error
was
made?
why
should
we
have
argued
to
show?
why
it
was
--
couldn't
be
held
harmless?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
defended
however
and
you
further
than
to
say
that
it
happened.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
would
like
you
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
get
to
the
merits
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
just
ask
you
this
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what
he
read,
did
that
take
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
took
place
thus
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
in
fact
it
told,
the
prosecutor
told
jury
that
she
had
view
to
testify
and
she
is
the
only
one
could
and
they
had
a
right
to
find
out
that
from
that
she
was
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
is
something
who
it
was,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
tell
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
is
your
reason
for
saying
that
that
was
harmless?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
to
say
what
that
mr.
justice
fortas
said.
what
is
it?
do
you
say
that
if
that
happened,
i
would
think
for
any
reasonable
person
to
know
that
was
harmless
to
the
defendant
then
what
do
you
say
then
to
keep
it
from
being
harmless?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
instruct
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
hard,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
was
the
defense,
but
why
and
how
can
you
say
it
was
harmless
error
for
all
the
case
to
decide
on
the
basis
that
the
jury
had
a
right
to
infer
her
guilt
from
the
facts
that
she
didn't
tell
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
violated
the
griffin
case,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
very
strong
mail
in
the
time
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
probably,
she
couldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
she
had
a
right
not
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
make
that
harmless
error?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
she
is
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
brought
about
finding
of
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
are
you
arguing
that
didn't
assist
in
bringing
about
the
verdict
of
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
no
influence
on
the
jurors.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
i
can
add
the
constitutional
guarantee
is
no
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
this
got
any
evidence
regarding
(inaudible)
it
was
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he'd
been
denied
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
forget
the
word
fair
trial
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
been
denied
a
lawyer.
according
to
you
that
wouldn't
raise
a
federal
question
if
the
state
were
to
say,
“well,
he's
denied
a
lawyer
but
he
didn't
heard
him.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
doesn't
(voice

the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
that
anytime
evidence
is
admitted
in
a
con
--
unconstitutional
manner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
broken
into
his
house
without
any
search
warrant
and
gather
some
goods,
and
offered
that
in
evidence
and
had
it,
would
you
say
that
that's
--
doesn't
raise
a
federal
question
if
he's
convicted
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
only
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
only
evidence
they
had
in
the
world
has
been
introduced
unconstitutionally,
would
you
say
that
this
court
--
that
didn't
raise
a
federal
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
(inaudible)
search
and
seizures,
confessions
and
everything
else.
its
all
--
that's
all
that's
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
the
federal
courts
do
not
have
a
right
to
determine
whether
that
hurt
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
have
done
that?
who
examined
it?
justice
hugo

black
the
federal
court.
justice

do
you

are

you

that
any

it's
shown

can
make

justice

isolated
now,
are
you?
justice

black
well,
that's

in

it

i
thought
that

you've

yes.

that
