mr.
smith,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
still
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
still
can't
understand
the
--
for
what
purpose
you
are
reciting
these
facts
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
unless
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
facts
in
this
case
were
so
conclusive
that
no
constitutional
violation
of
this
kind
could
affect
the
outcome
in
the
minds
of
the
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
this
proof
is
so
conclusive?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
thing
that
concerns
me
with
both
of
these
cases
is
that
in
one
of
them,
i
think
it's
the
next
case,
that
in
one
of
them,
the
attorney
general
of
california
argued
before
the
district
court
of
appeals
the
importance
of
the
evidence
that
is
involved.
and
that
not
only
its
relevance
but
its
importance
and
then
you
come
to
this
point
and
say
that
the
admission
of
that
very
evidence
is
harmless
error.
now,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
pretty
hard
to
--
pretty
hard
to
understand
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
think
those
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
those
two
positions
are
compatible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
is
a
more
or
less
important,
this
--
in
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
little
or
no
importance?
which
would
you
say,
little
importance
or
no
importance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
little
importance
is
quite
important
to
a
man
whose
life
is
at
stake.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
the
argument
of
counsel
does
not
bear
upon
on
whether
the
trial
is
fair
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
it
did
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
answer
justice
fortas'
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
that
in
response
to
justice
fortas'
question
that
that
would
not
affect
the
fairness
of
the
trial
and
it
would
not
be
a
federal
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
this
rule
that
you're
advocating
here
applies
to
your
next
case
from
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
there,
it
didn't
--
didn't
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
the
fact
that
this
brown
piece
of
paper
that
they
found
and
that
they
introduced
and
that
they
argued
was
of
great
importance
in
the
case.
did
that
not
affect
the
fact
when
in
process?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
was
it
introduced
if
it
didn't
--
if
it
wasn't
relevant
and
didn't
affect
the
outcome
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
unconstitutional
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
wasn't
it
admitted
in
the
next
case
that
the
search
was
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
court
said
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
have
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
supported
--
it's
what
you
call
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
you
stand
here
arguing
one
phase
of
it
and
you
say
because
it
isn't
evidence,
the
remarks
of
the
prosecutor
that
therefore
if
there's
no
federal
question,
you
say
it
has
to
bear
upon
the
fact
finding
process.
and
in
the
very
next
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
here
--
no,
let
me
finish
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
very
next
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
they
did
introduced
evidence
that
they
argued
to
the
jury
with
very
important
and
they
argued
it
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
do
you
say
there
that
although
your
courts
have
admitted
that
there
was
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure
whereby
they
obtained
this
paper
that
there
is
no
federal
question
involved
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
you
say
--
when
they
later
say
that
it's
harmless
error.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
that
be
true
of
any
unlawful
search
and
seizure
if
he
actually
found
evidence
against
the
man,
it
wouldn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
think
that
in
every
search
and
seizure
case
that
the
court
is
free
to
find
that
the
introduction
of
unlawfully
seized
evidence
is
harmless
error?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
no,
we're
not
dealing
with
assumptions.
we're
dealing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
if
it
does
happen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
louisville
versus
thomson
doesn't
try
any
part
in
this.
of
course,
this
evidence
that
they
got
by
an
unlawful
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
search
and
seizure
was
relevant.
of
course
it
was
material,
that's
the
reason
it
was
put
into
the
record.
so
we
couldn't
say
that
there
was
no
evidence
against
him.
the
question
is
was
it
constitutional
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
was
it
used
for
the
purpose
of
convicting
him
and
if
it
was
does
the
court
have
a
right
to
say
--
your
court
have
a
right
to
say
as
a
--
as
state
law
that
it
was
harmless
error
and
this
court
has
precluded
from
it
reading,
it
is
a
federal
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
under
what
section
of
the
constitution
do
we
reach
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
would
that
reach
this
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
just
said
that
you
misspoke
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
just
said
you
misspoke
yourself
that
louisville
didn't
apply.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
what
section
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
we
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
we
also
say
by
the
same
reasoning
if
there
is
no
constitutional
question
in
--
i
mean
if
there
is
no
federal
question
in
this
case
then
in
all
cases,
the
state
can
say,
â€œoh,
yes
we
agree
that
this
man's
constitutional
rights
were
violated
but
we
believe
it's
a
question
of
state
law
whether
it
is
--
whether
it
was
harmful
or
not
to
him
and
we
conclude
that
it
is
not
harmful
therefore
his
conviction
is
sustained.
