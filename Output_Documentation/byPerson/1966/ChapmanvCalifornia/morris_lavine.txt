mr.
morris
lavine
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
morris
lavine
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
supreme
court
of
california
on
a
death
penalty
case
involving
the
petitioner
thomas
leroy
teale
and
life
sentence
of
ruth
elizabeth
chapman
who
was
--
both
of
whom
were
convicted
in
san
joaquin
county
following
a
trial
by
jury.
at
the
beginning,
i
would
like
to
make
two
corrections
or
in
the
record.
i
call
the
attention
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
that
this
case
came
up
during
the
pendency
of
the
griffin
case
and
as
stated
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
15
all
over
conviction
in
the
case
at
bar
was
obtained
in
1963,
the
processes
on
direct
appeal
have
not
been
completed
prior
to
griffin
and
hence
the
griffin
rule
would
apply
say
for
the
application
of
a
harmless
error
rule
of
page
15
in
the
respondent's
brief.
i
want
to
call
that
correction
to
your
honors
because
in
my
summary
of
the
argument,
i
stated
that
the
griffin
case
have
been
fully
decided.
this
was
incorrect
and
i
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
clerk
didn't
get
corrected
in
my
brief.
the
second
point
i
wish
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention
is
the
fact
that
article
6
section
4.5
the
so-called
harmless
error
rule
in
the
state
of
california
has
been
practically
readopted
in
its
words
on
november
8,
1966
when
california
adopted
a
partial
set
of
amendments
to
its
state
constitution.
so,
where
we
refer
to
article
6,
section
4.5
of
the
california
constitution
that
is
now
article
6,
section
13
of
the
california
constitution.
well,
however,
it
would
--
it
is
practically
the
same
in
its
wording
as
it
was
prior
i
think
there's
just
one
word
changed
but
not
materially
to
affect
anything
that
we
argue
here.
the
--
this
case
involves
the
question
of
the
comment
of
the
prosecutor
throughout
the
case
in
his
argument
in
the
circumstantial
evidence
case.
in
--
prior
to
griffin
versus
california,
which
your
honors
remember,
the
supreme
court
of
california
sent
a
case
to
this
court,
sent
copies
of
its
decision,
i
believe
in
modesto
--
people
versus
modesto.
i
believe
justice
brennan
will
recall
during
the
oral
argument
he
called
the
attention
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
trying
to
prejudge
this
court
action.
after
this
court
passed
on
griffin
versus
california
and
reversed
griffin
on
the
basis
of
comments
by
the
prosecutor
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
take
the
stand,
california
again
repetition
this
court
or
rehearing
which
was
denied
and
raised
this
question
of
the
harmless
error
rule.
now,
again
we
have
in
chapman
and
teale
versus
california
the
question,
the
admitted
the
fact
that
throughout
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor
there
were
complete
comments
by
the
prosecutor
on
the
failure
of
the
defendants
plural
to
take
the
witness
stand
and
this
court
has
set
forth
for
a
decision
by
this
case
whether
the
violation
of
griffin
versus
california,
number
609
was
error,
cannot
be
harmless
in
this
case
and
so
i
will
meet
both
of
those
questions
on
those
so
to
speak.
first
of
all,
i
think
there
is
own
case
that
your
honors
have
had
before
you
where
there
has
been
such
a
replete
and
continues
argument
on
the
failure
of
a
defendant
to
take
the
witness
stand.
the
--
in
this
case,
the
very
briefly
the
facts
are,
did
the
bartender
was
found
dead
in
a
gulley
on
october
18,
1963
and
at
the
time
of
his
having
been
found
there,
the
state
traced
back
the
case
and
commenced
the
prosecution
arresting
mrs.
chapman
on
october
26
and
bring
her
back
and
taking
her
statement,
taking
her
to
the
district
attorney's
office
where
she
made
an
84-page
statement
as
of
1963,
it
was
october
18,
1962.
the
--
she
was
taken
to
the
district
attorney's
office
and
there
she
was
questioned
extensively
and
made
an
84-page
statement
without
the
benefit
or
advice
of
counsel.
while
the
statement
itself
was
that
--
has
reduced
in
evidence.
she
was
urged
to
see
a
psychiatrist
and
the
district
attorney
secured
a
psychiatrist
to
see
her
and
his
testimony
before
the
court
was
largely
based
upon
this
84-page
statement
which
he
made
to
the
district
attorney.
now,
the
prosecutor
went
back,
mr.
ferguson
who
was
the
deputy
district
attorney
went
back
to
pick
up
teale
after
he
was
arrested
on
november
2
and
thereafter
came
back
with
teale
who
was
placed
in
a
cell
with
another
man
who
later
became
a
witness
against
teale.
but
neither
chapman
nor
teale
took
the
witness
stand.
they
stood
on
their
constitutional
rights
both
defendants
were
indigent.
the
supreme
--
the
court
appointed
counsel,
the
public
defender
was
first
appointed
and
later
got
relieved
because
of
a
conflict
of
interest
and
these
two
gentlemen
were
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
the
defendants
in
the
trial.
mr.
richard
johnson
who
sits
here
was
the
former
assistant
district
attorney
in
san
joaquin
county
and
the
other
lawyers
and
immanent
lawyer
of
the
bar
there
and
they
saw
the
case
through
the
supreme
court
of
california.
now,
upon
their
advice
and
on
the
advice
of
their
counsel,
neither
one
of
these
defendants
took
the
witness
stand
but
the
prosecutor
kept
repeatedly
buttressing
his
case
where
he
lack
proof
with
arguments.
now,
these
people
could
tell
you
what
they
chose
not
to
testify.
it
would
take
me
nearly
all
of
my
time
that
to
read
some
of
these
comments
but
i'm
going
to
read
a
few
just
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention
the
many
places
in
this
lengthy
record
where
the
defendants
were
found
guilty
on
the
basis
of
comments
by
the
prosecutor
and
later
by
the
direction
of
the
court
that
they
could've
taken
the
stand
and
if
they
did
not
then
that
the
jury
could
draw
from
that
fact
the
inference
that
they
were
guilty.
on
page
20
of
my
opening
brief,
i
set
forth
ruth
chapman
is
sitting
right
over
here.
she
is
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
and
she
is
the
one
who
certainly
if
anyone
in
this
room
or
in
this
state
knows
what
was
in
those
boxes,
she
is
the
one.
but
once
again
she
did
not
take
the
stand,
raise
her
right
hand
and
tell
you
about
that.
she
didn't
take
the
stand
at
all
ladies
and
gentlemen.
she
could've
come
up
and
tells
you
--
us
exactly
what
articles
were
set.
so,
you
may
draw
any
inferences
from
that
that
you
wish
as
long
as
they
are
reasonable.
now,
we
come
first
of
all
to
the
issue
of
the
gun
and
the
gun
that
was
used
or
the
guns
that
were
used
allegedly
in
the
murder.
now,
the
prosecutor
says,
he
doesn't
know
which
gun
was
used
and
they
brought
neither
of
the
guns
that
were
allegedly
apart
of
this
transaction
were
ever
found
by
the
prosecutor
brought
in
similar
guns
or
guns
that
were
suppose
to
be
like
those
that
were
used.
and
now,
the
prosecutor
then
argues
here.
he
says
that
now,
page
1808
of
the
reporter's
transcript
and
incidentally
the
transcript
was
not
transcribed
but
you
have
the
copy
of
the
original
record
here
in
the
clerk's
office.
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
i
don't
know
which
one
of
these
weapons
was
purchased
first.
i
don't
know
that
it
particularly
makes
any
difference
but
as
you
know
we
have
had
no
testimony
at
all
in
that
regard.
in
fact,
i
might
add
that
the
only
person
or
persons
i
could
give
testimony
in
that
regard
would
be
of
course
the
defendants
themselves.
so,
we
don't
know
when
they
were
purchased
or
rather
we
know
the
date
but
we
don't
know
the
exact
time
or
what
sequence
was
for
this
i
refer
to
here
for
the
record
people's
exhibit
number
14,
there's
32
caliber
pistol
which
was
purchased
by
the
defendant
ruth
elizabeth
chapman.
now,
he
says
they
don't
have
the
weapon
but
they've
got
a
replica
there.
now,
he
says
they
can't
tell
what
he
goes
on
at
some
pages
of
argument
and
that
he
says
they
can't
tell
which
weapon
was
used
and
they
don't
know
but
the
defendants
if
they
took
the
stand
could
tell
the
court
which
weapon
was
used.
so,
he
says,
it's
a
constitutional
right
in
both
of
these
defendants
see
to
fit
to
avail
themselves
of
that
constitutional
right.
but
i
say
to
you
ladies
and
gentlemen,
there
are
many
things
in
this
case
and
i
will
try
to
point
them
out
to
you
at
least
probably
not
all
that
these
defendants
are
in
a
position
to
take
that
stand
and
to
testify
under
oath
and
give
you
facts
concerning.
they
have
not
seen
fit
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity.
then
again,
he
says,
now
up
to
this
point
page
1824
of
the
reporter's
transcript,
i
appeal
that
the
testimony
clearly
shows
that
the
defendants,
number
one,
there
is
motive,
not
in
necessity
item
to
the
crime
at
all
but
only
helpful,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
committed
it
and
then
he
talks
about
a
check
that
was
passed
without
sufficient
funds
and
he
says,
later
on
at
page
1826.
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
reference
to
the
weapons
being
purchased
in
reno,
nevada
on
october
12
you
have
heard
ladies
and
gentlemen
no
testimony
and
you
will
recall
clearly
you
were
going
to
have
some
difficulty,
you
really
are
as
reference
to
what
is
and
what
is
evidence
in
this
case
and
believe
me
i
have
a
few
comments
to
say
on
that
a
little
later
on.
but
if
you
will
recall
as
far
as
evidence
is
concerned
or
of
the
truth
of
anything
at
all,
you
don't
have
any
evidence
on
why
these
pistols
were
purchased?
why
did
ruth
elizabeth
chapman
buy
two
weapons?
well,
you
do
recall
that
she
told
on
one
occasion
that
she
had
a
piston
stolen
from
her
vehicle
and
when
she
was
taking
a
little
trip
across
the
country,
you
remember
that
testimony
and
then
i'm
skipping
now.
then
he
says
--
then
he
says,
but
certainly
the
defendant
ruth
elizabeth
chapman
could
tell
you,
she
could
tell
you
one
under
oath.
she
could
subject
herself
to
cross-examination
and
she
could
tell
you
then
and
it
would
evidence
before
you.
once
again,
she
has
not
chosen
to
do
this.
so,
any
inference
you
may
draw
there
from
will
be
an
adverse
inference
under
the
circumstances
and
under
the
instructions
of
a
court,
you
are
exclusive
judges
of
the
fact
themselves.
and
i
could
continue
on
and
i
have
quoted
several
of
these
other
passages
in
my
brief
and
then
the
comments
on
teale,
page
1854
of
the
record
of
the
comments
on
--
mr.
morris
lavine
what
is
that
your
honor?
mr.
morris
lavine
yes.
that
is
the
point
i'm
coming
to,
your
honor,
but
i
have
to
lay
predicate
to
show
the
character
of
these
comments.
so,
we're
to
supply
what
the
prosecution
was
unable
to
prove
in
the
case.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
has
ever
held
that
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
is
harmless
error
and
we
come
to
the
point
that
your
honor
has
just
raised
in
the
matter.
i
wanted
to
lay
the
predicate,
your
honor,
of
the
terrific
amount
of
comments
made
throughout
to
show
just
how
the
prosecutor
supplied
the
absence
of
proof
that
was
his
burden
by
comments
by
him
as
to
the
failure
of
the
defendants
to
take
the
witness
stand
and
to
supply
what
the
griffin
case
says
cannot
be
supplied
to
use
the
silence
of
the
defendant
as
the
basis
of
conviction.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
your
honor.
my
--
my
interpretation
of
griffin
as
your
honors
laid
it
down
was
that
silence
could
not
be
use
to
supply
an
evidence
and
that
the
silence
of
the
--
mr.
morris
lavine
what
is
that
your
honor?
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
as
i
interpreted
griffin
your
honor,
that
was
the
import
of
the
griffin
case.
i
--
i
have
been
wrestling
with
that
principle,
your
honor,
since
adamson
versus
california
18
years
before
when
justice
black
in
a
very
illuminating
dissent
and
very
wonderful
dissent
that's
read
in
all
the
law
schools
today
stated
the
position
that
this
court
has
now
taken
in
griffin
versus
california.
in
adamson,
we
started
18
years
ago
where
the
comment
of
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
morris
lavine
no,
it
does
not
argue
that
there
was
a
violation
of
griffin.
it
argues
whether
it
was
harmless
error.
now,
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
your
honor.
i
argue
two
possessions
in
connection
with
this
matter.
first,
i
argue
that
being
a
constitutional
violation,
being
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
that
it
cannot
be
deemed
to
be
harmless
error
that
this
court
has
never
said
in
any
of
its
cases
that
error
of
this
--
of
a
constitutional
proportion
was
harmless
error.
now,
i
go
back
to
your
earlier
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
you're
--
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
arguing
if
those
are
the
constitutional
point
that
it's
not
a
slight
incontestable
point.
mr.
morris
lavine
no.
mr.
morris
lavine
no.
i'm
arguing
that
if
it's
a
constitutional
violation
it
can't
be
an
isolated
point.
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
right
your
honor.
if
it
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
i
can't
define
it
on
the
basis
on
what
you're
defining
harmless
error,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
it
does
not
--
it
cannot
be
--
mr.
morris
lavine
harmful,
i
--
mr.
morris
lavine
may
i
answer
your
honor
in
the
language
of
bollenbach
case
and
to
state
my
position?
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
i
do
but
i
want
to
answer
your
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
my
argument
is
that
error
of
a
constitutional
proportion
i
have
to
argue
with
you
on
this
point
justice
black
because
i
can't
--
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
arguing
that
errors
of
a
constitutional
proportion
cannot
be
slight,
trifling
or
infinite
testable
or
de
minimis
lex
that
argue
--
that
errors
of
a
--
for
instance
denial
of
the
right
of
counsel
is
a
constitutional
right.
we
can't
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
who
doesn't
have
counsel
is
so
slight
if
he
has
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that's
not
this
case
but
i'm
citing
various
constitutional
principles.
i
am
saying
i
cannot
see
any
case
where
a
defendant
refuses
to
testify
on
constitutional
ground
can
be
a
slight
error
where
he
stands
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
say
that
--
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
can't
see
--
i'm
not
arguing
that
your
honor.
i'm
arguing
--
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
arguing
that
error
of
a
constitutional
side
can
never
be
so
slight
or
trifling.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
that
you
can
overlook
it
and
i
can't
find
any
case
as
i
have
found
where
this
court
has
held
where
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation
that
it
is
slight
or
trifling.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that's
right.
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
right,
your
honor.
that's
my
position.
now,
in
bollenbach
versus
united
states
back
in
1945
a
jury
was
out
seven
hours

the
judge
called
the
jury
back
in
to
give
them
another
instruction.

the
court
there
after
calling
the
jury
back
gave
them
further
instructions
which
it
was
held
it
was
erroneous.
the
evidence
apparently
from
the
standpoint
of
the
government
and
possibly
from
the
standpoint
of
the
court
was
regarded
as
the
overwhelming,
but
in
any
event,
this
court
laid
down
what
is
my
position
here
in
respect
to
the
situation
as
to
what
maybe
called
harmless
error.
the
government
argues
that
the
sting
of
error
is
extracted
because
there
was
proof
other
than
the
erroneous
presumption
on
the
issue
of
bollenbach's
participation
and
i'm
skipping
some
things
that
would
be
along
jump
at
guessing
to
be
confident
that
the
jury
did
not
rely
on
the
erroneous
presumption.
the
charge
should
not
be
misleading,
legal
presumptions
involve
settled
conception
to
which
not
even
judges
always
bring
clear
understandingly.
we
cannot
treat
the
manifest
misdirection
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
one
of
those
technical
errors
which
do
not
affect
the
substantial
rights
of
the
parties
and
must
be
disregarded.
all
law
is
technical
if
viewed
solely
from
the
concern
for
punishing
crime
without
hitting
the
mode
which
is
accomplished,
the
technical
errors
against
which
congress
protected
jury
verdicts
are
of
a
kind
which
led
some
judges
to
trivialize
law
by
giving
all
legal
prescriptions
equal
potency,
see
taft
and
so
forth.
deviations
from
formal
correctness
do
not
touch
the
substance
of
the
standards
by
which
guilt
is
determined
in
our
court
and
under
these
that
congress
rendered
harmless
citing
bruno
versus
united
states
and
wyler
versus
united
states
presuming
to
often
that
all
errors
to
be
prejudicial
the
judicial
pendulum
need
not
swing
to
presume
all
errors
to
be
harmless
if
only
the
appellate
court
is
left
in
doubt
without
doubt
that
one
who
claims
that
correct
due
process
is
after
all
guilty.
in
view
of
the
place
of
importance,
the
trial
by
jury
has
in
our
bill
of
rights.
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
congress
intended
to
substitute
the
belief
of
appellate
judges
in
the
guilt
of
an
accused.
however,
justifiably
engendered
by
the
dead
record
for
ascertainment
of
guilt
by
a
jury
under
appropriate
judicial
guidance
however
cumbersome
that
process
may
be
and
the
judgment
in
that
case
was
reversed.
now,
the
court
there
laid
down
the
standard
that
i
think
is
the
standard
that
i'm
urging
on
this
court
in
the
question
of
harmless
error.
now,
in
bruno
versus
united
states,
in
308
u.s.
october
term
1939,
page
293,
the
court
there
said
a
subsidiary
question
remains
for
determination.
it
derives
from
the
act
of
february
26,
1919
whereby
appellate
courts
are
on
their
duty
in
criminal
as
well
as
civil
cases
to
regard
that
--
disregard
technical
errors,
defects
or
exceptions
which
do
not
affect
the
substantial
right
to
the
party.
is
this
regard
of
the
right
which
congress
came
to
bruno
an
error?
the
commission
of
which
we
may
disregard
we
hold
not.
it
would
be
idle
to
predetermine
the
scope
of
such
remedial
provisions
of
section
391
by
anticipating
the
myriad
varieties
of
rulings
made
in
trial
in
attempting
to
abstract
include
definitions
of
technical
errors.
suffice
to
this
to
indicate
when
every
student
behind
the
act
of
february
26,
1919
knows
that
act
was
intended
to
prevent
matters
concerned
which
mere
etiquette
of
trials
with
the
formalities
and
minutiae
or
procedure
from
touching
the
merits
of
a
verdict
of
a
different
order
of
importance
is
the
right
of
an
accused
to
insist
on
the
privilege
which
congress
has
given
him
and
to
paraphrase
that
expression
of
a
different
order
of
importance
is
the
right
of
an
accused
to
insist
on
the
privilege
which
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
has
given
to
him.
to
suggest
--
to
the
suggested
benefits
a
defendant
fails
to
take
the
stand
not
to
have
the
attention
of
the
jury
directly
to
that
effect,
it
suffices
to
say
that
however
difficult
it
maybe
to
exercise
enlightened
self
interest,
the
accused
should
be
allowed
to
make
his
own
choice
when
an
act
of
congress
authorizes
him
to
choose
and
now
i
paraphrase
that
again
and
say
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
has
authorized
him
to
choose
and
whether
this
urged
that
it
is
a
psychologically
impossibility
not
to
have
a
presumption
rights
of
the
minds
of
jurors
against
an
accused
who
fail
to
testify
to
sure
the
answer
is
that
congress
legislated
on
the
contrary
assumption
and
not
without
support
of
experience.
it
was
for
congress
to
decide
whether
it
was
deemed
legally
sufficient
what
was
psychologically
futile.
certainly,
despite
the
vast
accumulation
of
psychological
data,
we
have
not
yet
obtain
that
servitude
about
the
human
mind
which
would
justify
us
in
disregarding
the
will
of
congress
by
dogmatic
assumption
that
jurors
have
probably
is
--
properly
admonished
either
could
nor
would
he,
the
destructions
of
the
trial
court
that
the
failure
of
the
accused
to
be
a
witness
in
his
own
cause
shall
not
create
any
presumption
against
him.
and
there,
the
court
held
that
if
the
accused
asked
for
that
instruction
he
should
be
given
and
they
hold
that
that
is
a
substantial
question
which
ought
to
be
presented.
now,
in
the
case
of
wyler
versus
united
states,
your
honors
will
recall
that
was
a
case
involving
the
question
of
one
or
two
witnesses
in
a
perjury
case
and
the
court
there
held
that
the
two
witness
rule
was
still
required,
that
case
is
reported
in
323
u.s,
at
page
600
--
reading
from
page
611.
it
is
argued
that
this
error
did
not
prejudice
the
defendant.
we
cannot
say
that
it
did
not.
the
jury
convicted
without
being
instructed
that
more
than
the
testimony
with
single
witness
was
required
to
justify
their
verdict.
this
was
no
mere
technical
error
relating
to
the
formalities
and
minutiae
of
trial.
this
is
what
i
am
urging
justice
black
in
answer
to
your
question
that
there
maybe
formalities
in
minutiae
in
connection
with
the
trial
that
would
be
excused
but
if
it
was
a
constitutional
violation
as
all
of
your
cases
we
have
held
on
this
right
of
self-incrimination
it
is
not
the
mere
technical
error.
we
are
not
authorized
to
look
at
the
printed
record
result
conflicting
evidence
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
error
was
harmless
because
we
think
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
that
would
be
to
substitute
of
our
judgment
or
that
of
the
jury.
and
under
our
system
of
justice,
juries
alone
have
been
entrusted
with
that
responsibility
and
i
may
say
the
same
as
in
the
state
of
california
under
article
1,
section
7
as
it
existed
the
time
of
this
case
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
had
a
jury
trial.
it's
not
for
the
appellate
court
or
the
supreme
court
of
california
or
even
this
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
or
the
judgment
of
the
trial
jurors
who
see
the
witnesses
and
hear
the
witnesses
nor
are
we
compelled
to
conclude
that
this
error
was
harmless
because
of
actions
of
another
case
which
they
cited.
now,
that
this
case
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
its
own
facts.
now,
one
other
case
that
your
honors
decided
recently
was
the
case
of
stewart
versus
united
states
and
reported
in
366
u.s.
at
page
1.
in
that
case,
the
petitioner
was
tried
three
times
in
the
federal
court
for
murder.
the
first
two
trials,
he
didn't
take
the
witness
stand,
the
third
trial
he
did
and
he
was
asked
the
question
that
he
have
not
taken
the
witness
stand
on
the
earlier
two
trials.
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black
wrote
the
reversal
in
that
case
and
held
that
that
was
not
harmless
error.
you
held
that
it
was
error
to
ask
that
question
which
raised
the
question
of
the
defendant
not
having
taken
the
witness
stand.
and
so
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes.
page
9
of
the
printed
opinion,
the
government's
final
contention
is
that
the
use
of
error
was
prejudicial,
the
conviction
should
be
allowed
to
stand
on
the
theory
that
the
error
was
not
sufficiently
prejudicial
to
warrant
the
granting
of
a
mistrial
and
the
defense
made
no
request
for
cautionary
instruction.
so,
quoting
your
own
language
justice
black
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
what
else,
your
honor?
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
quoting
it
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
oh,
i'm
about
to
go
on
with
the
rest
of
the
opinion
as
you
reversed
it.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
your
honor.
one
answer
to
this
argument
is
to
be
found
in
the
government's
own
brief
for
in
its
argument
regarding
the
possibility
that
the
jury
may
not
have
been
aware
of
the
improper
question.
the
government
stresses
the
fact
that
the
question
was
not
emphasized
by
any
reference
to
what
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
during
the
course
of
this
argument,
the
government
expressly
recognizes
that
the
danger
of
the
situation
would've
been
increased
by
a
cautionary
instruction
in
that
such
of
instruction
would
have
again
brought
the
jury's
attention
to
petitioner's
prior
failure
to
testify.
plainly,
the
defense
was
under
no
such,
no
obligation
to
take
such
a
risk.
the
motion
for
mistrial
was
entirely
appropriate
and
indeed
necessary
to
protect
the
interest
of
petitioner.
we,
thus,
conclude
that
this
conviction
and
sentence
against
petitioner
cannot
stand.
in
--
in
doing
so,
we
agree
with
the
point
made
by
the
government
in
its
brief
that
it
is
regrettable
that
the
concurrent
finding
of
36
jurors
are
not
sufficiently
final
to
terminate
a
case
but
under
our
system
a
man
is
entitled
to
the
finding
of
12
jurors
on
evidence
fairly
and
properly
presented
to
them.
petitioner
may
not
be
deprived
his
right
until
that
right
is
accorded
him.
that
right
was
denied
here
by
the
prosecutor's
improper
question.
so,
i
submit
here
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
your
honor,
there's
been
no
error
--
no
case
as
i
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
if
your
honor
please,
that
was
one
of
the
points
that
the
government
raised
in
the
case.
you
should,
it
had
to
be
argued
because
your
honors
granted
certiorari
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
correct.
now,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
any
case
in
this
court
where
your
honor
has
pointed
to
any
case
or
where
any
decision
existed
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
this
court
where
there's
been
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
proportion
where
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
harmless
error.
i
have
cited
about
seven
cases
in
my
brief
involving
particularly
confessions
and
other
constitutional
violation.
but
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
of
which
says
that
the
failure
that
there's
any
situation
which
--
in
which
the
right
of
self-incrimination
has
been
brought
in
that
is
to
have
this
court
has
held
to
be
harmless
and
the
cases
i
have
cited,
i
think
are
in
support
of
that
position.
i
take
the
position
that
the
harmless
error
rule
was
not
meant
to
overlook
violations
of
constitutional
magnitude
and
i
think
that
in
this
case
looking
at
this
record
and
the
numerous
comments
by
the
prosecutor
as
planning
the
lack
of
proof
that
the
state
have
with
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor
constituted
the
error
highly
prejudicial
and
certainly
not
harmless
in
this
case.
so,
my
argument
is
two-fold.
first,
that
any
violation
of
griffin,
any
violation
of
failure
to
take
the
comment
on
the
failure
of
a
defendant
take
the
witness
stand
is
itself
error
that
requires
that
it's
a
constitutional
magnitude
and
therefore
does
not
come
within
the
harmless
error
rule
but
if
it
does,
the
repeated
and
constant
comments
on
this
case
make
the
error
of
such
magnitude
that
it
is
not
harmless
in
this
case
and
it's
very
highly
prejudicial.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
he
instructed
in
the
language
of
the
adamson
case,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
page
--
it's
referred
to
in
page
17
of
my
closing
brief
and
it's
referred
to
in
reporter's
transcript
page
2163
that
among
the
inferences
that
may
reasonably
be
drawn
there
from
those
unfavorable
to
the
defendant
are
the
more
probable.
now,
that's
the
abbreviation
of
the
entire
instruction
your
honor
but
the
instruction
is
in
the
language
of
the
prior
adamson
case
which
is
the
one
with
collegiate
standard
previously
standard
instructions
prior
to
the
adamson
case.
and
i
will
possibly
look
it
up
during
the
argument
of
my
opponent
to
give
you
the
full
text
of
it.
thank
you.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
has
stated
that
there
was
no
impact
upon
the
jury
in
connection
with
this
case
in
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor.
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
appendix
e
in
my
brief,
starting
at
page
92,
you
will
find
the
--
from
that
page
92
to
106
of
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
witness
stand
together
with
page
references
in
the
original
transcript
which
is
on

here.
it
would
take
more
than

have
allotted
to
me
to
read
all
of
these
comments.

of

counsel
misstates
the
statement
that
there
was
a
confession.
the

talked
to
a
fellow
prisoner
in
jail.
he
said
he
--
they'll
have
a
hard
time
proving
i
was
there.
now,
then
this
is
the
extent
and
then
the
prosecutor
argued
page
1855
of
the
transcript
which
as
i
state
you
have
the
original
unfiled
in
the
basement
here
and
the
prosecutor
says,
“now,
i
don't
know
what
he
meant
by
that
statement.
i
certainly
can
draw
my
own
conclusion
and
you
sure
can
draw
yours.”
the
state
has
drawn
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a

your
honors
and
i
thought
--
i
attempted
to
make
it
clear
yesterday
that
when
the
framers
of
our
constitution
had
to
implement
it
with
the
bill
of
rights
that
the
essential
portions
of
the
bill
of
rights
became
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
court
at
least
has
held
that
the
fifth
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment,
the
sixth
amendment
and
possibly
the
eighth
have
now
become
incorporated
by
the
rules
of
this
court,
by
the
opinions
of
this
court
as
a
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
my
position
your
honors
that
these
are
fundamental
errors
of
constitutional
magnitude
which
the
framers
of
our
constitution
and
the
persons
who
adopted
the
bill
of
rights
put
in
there
so
that
the
constitution
could
pass
and
that
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
they
did
in
their
first
opinion
your
honor
--
mr.
morris
lavine
--
and
then
later
they
amended
that
and
modified
it.
mr.
morris
lavine
well
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
and
particularly
in
this
case,
i
want
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
something
unusual
that
happened
in
this
case.
when
the
first
opinion
came
down,
the
court
--
the
california
court
apparently
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
this
comment.
on
page
55
of
my
brief
the
court's
opinion,
first
opinion
is
set
forth
as
stated,
neither
defendant
testified
in
his
or
her
own
behalf
in
the
exercise
of
their
constitutional
privilege.
this
failure
to
testify
was
not
commented
upon
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
but
the
court
in
instructions
to
the
jury
and
in
accordance
with
the
california
constitutional
provision
stated
among
other
things
that
the
failure
of
defendants
to
testify
from
facts
within
their
knowledge
and
explanation
of
incriminating
evidence
maybe
deemed
as
tending
to
indicate
the
truth
of
such
incriminating
evidence
and
that
among
the
inferences
that
may
reasonably
--
maybe
reasonably
drawn
there
from,
those
unfavorable
to
the
defendant
are
the
more
probable.
now,
immediately
there
was
a
petition
for
rehearing
file
calling
attention
to
the
court
that
they
had
overlooked
all
these
comments
which
i
have
called
your
honor's
attention
in
my
brief
from
pages
92
until
the
end.
so
they
then
adopted
and
--
a
modifying
opinion
in
which
they
acknowledged
that
they
were
wrong
and
set
forth
that
there
were
a
number
of
arguments
made
as
to
the
failure
of
the
defendants
to
take
the
stand.
in
fact
it
covers
two,
almost
two
printed
pages
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
the
foregoing
comments
and
instruction
have
been
ruled
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
griffin
versus
california,
malloy
versus
hogan
--
mr.
morris
lavine
59
and
60,
yes,
your
honor.
start
--
mr.
morris
lavine
no,
they
do
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
set
forth
those
very
matters
and
admit
them
in
their
respondent's
brief.
but
with
the
--
some
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
i
believe
that
the
respondent
has
admitted
in
its
brief
most
of
these
comments
but
i
have
set
them
forth
in
considerably
more
detail
and
mr.
chief
justice
you
asked
me
yesterday
about
the
instructions
of
the
court
to
the
jury
and
i
have
read
it
out
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
part
but
the
complete
instruction
is
contained
on
page
2163
of
the
typewritten
record
which
you
have
here.
mr.
morris
lavine
only
if
it
denied
fair
trial
as
this
court
has
construed
it
by
its
numerous
cases.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
because
as
i
read
the
--
as
i
read
the
history
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
go
back
to
an
opinion
written
--
a
dissenting
opinion
written
in
twining
versus
new
jerseyin
211
u.s.
at
page
114
by
then
mr.
justice
harlan
which
is
very
long
and
i
haven't
time
to
read
it
but
it's
about
100
--
about
12
pages
long
and
it's
very
full
and
gives
a
quite
a
history
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
he
viewed
as
being
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
that
is
right
but
you
--
but
i
still
--
but
you
asked
me
if
any
constitutional
error
per
se
becomes
automatically
a
harmful
error
and
i
say
that
it
does
because
it's
of
constitutional
magnitude
and
because
the
framers
of
our
constitution
insisted
in
the
formation
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
the
bill
of
rights
be
passed
before
they
would
agree
to
the
passing
of
the
constitution
and
nine
states
in
this
country
voted
for
the
bill
of
rights
because
--
and
the
constitution
was
passed
only
because
the
bill
of
rights
was
there
to
protect
the
people
in
those
fundamental
rights.
now,
what
are
those
fundamental
rights?
the
fourth
amendment,
unlawful
search
and
seizure
which
your
honor
has
in
the
next
case,
the
fifth
amendment,
self
incrimination,
the
denial
of
counsel,
illegally
securing
confession;
the
sixth
amendment,
denial
of
counsel.
can
we
name
any
right
that
is
guaranteed
by
the
consti
--
bill
of
rights
that
it
is
now
of
fundamental
error,
that
it
is
now
of
such
magnitude
that
the
mere
failure
to
observe
it
is
of
such
an
error
as
requires
its
recognition
and
that
any
rule
that
says
of
it
as
harmless
tries
to
limit
the
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
summing
up
in
this
case,
it
is
my
position
that
the
state
of
california
has
conceded
that
error
was
committed
in
this
case
by
the
numerous
comments
and
they
have
conceded
that
it
violated,
as
the
griffin
rule
and
the
malloy
versus
the
hogan
rule
exists
today.
they
would
turn
the
faucet
on
and
off.
they
say
it
was
harmless
yesterday
but
it's
harmful
today.
well,
such
a
view
cannot
be
taken
of
fundamental
error
such
as
an
existence
here
nor
all
these
pages
as
i
have
set
forth
in
from
page
92
on
in
my
brief.
now,
there
is
a
little
comment
that
was
made
in
an
opinion
written
here
sometime
back
in
miller
versus
the
territory
of
oklahoma
which
was
adopted
by
our
court
and
people
versus
glass,
the
seal
unrestrained
by
legal
barriers
of
some
prosecuting
attorneys
tempts
to
an
insistence
upon
the
admission
of
incompetent
evidence
or
getting
before
the
jury
some
extraneous
facts
suppose
to
be
helpful
in
securing
a
verdict
of
guilty
where
they
have
prestige
enough
to
induce
the
trial
court
to
give
them
latitude.
when
the
error
is
exposed
on
appeal,
it
is
about
whether
stereotype
argument
that
is
not
apparent
and
anywise
that
it
in
anywise
influence
the
minds
of
the
jury
just
as
your
honor
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
arguing
with
the
attorney
general
here
in
comment
to
the
attorney
general.
the
reply
the
law
makes
to
such
suggestion
is
that
after
injecting
it
into
the
case
to
influence
the
jury,
the
prosecutor
ought
not
to
be
heard
to
say
after
he
has
secured
the
conviction
it
was
harmless.
as
the
appellate
court
has
done
inside
in
--
to
the
deliberation
of
the
jury
room,
the
presumption
is
to
be
indulged
in
favor
of
the
liberty
of
the
citizen
that
whatever
the
prosecutor
against
the
protest
of
the
defendant
as
laid
before
the
jury
help
to
make
up
the
way
of
the
prosecution
which
resulted
in
the
verdict
of
guilty.
your
honors
will
find
that
on
page
6
of
my
closing
brief.
it's
adopted
in
people
versus
miranda
and
again
this
court
in
its
early
case
of
bram
versus
u.s.
also
have
the
language
that
is
quite
similar
that
the
court
cannot
say
after
it
has
come
in
that
it
is
harmless.
the
prosecutor
used
it
to
bring
a
conviction.
he
used
it
to
lead
the
jury
to
infer
the
guilt
of
these
defendants
and
on
top
of
inferring
to
the
guilt
of
these
defendants
that
the
court
instructed
the
jury
in
language
that
told
them
they
could
do
that
respectfully.
thank
you.
mr.
morris
lavine
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
morris
lavine
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
supreme
court
of
california
on
a
death
penalty
case
involving
the
petitioner
thomas
leroy
teale
and
life
sentence
of
ruth
elizabeth
chapman
who
was
--
both
of
whom
were
convicted
in
san
joaquin
county
following
a
trial
by
jury.
at
the
beginning,
i
would
like
to
make
two
corrections
or
in
the
record.
i
call
the
attention
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
that
this
case
came
up
during
the
pendency
of
the
griffin
case
and
as
stated
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
15
all
over
conviction
in
the
case
at
bar
was
obtained
in
1963,
the
processes
on
direct
appeal
have
not
been
completed
prior
to
griffin
and
hence
the
griffin
rule
would
apply
say
for
the
application
of
a
harmless
error
rule
of
page
15
in
the
respondent's
brief.
i
want
to
call
that
correction
to
your
honors
because
in
my
summary
of
the
argument,
i
stated
that
the
griffin
case
have
been
fully
decided.
this
was
incorrect
and
i
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
clerk
didn't
get
corrected
in
my
brief.
the
second
point
i
wish
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention
is
the
fact
that
article
6
section
4.5
the
so-called
harmless
error
rule
in
the
state
of
california
has
been
practically
readopted
in
its
words
on
november
8,
1966
when
california
adopted
a
partial
set
of
amendments
to
its
state
constitution.
so,
where
we
refer
to
article
6,
section
4.5
of
the
california
constitution
that
is
now
article
6,
section
13
of
the
california
constitution.
well,
however,
it
would
--
it
is
practically
the
same
in
its
wording
as
it
was
prior
i
think
there's
just
one
word
changed
but
not
materially
to
affect
anything
that
we
argue
here.
the
--
this
case
involves
the
question
of
the
comment
of
the
prosecutor
throughout
the
case
in
his
argument
in
the
circumstantial
evidence
case.
in
--
prior
to
griffin
versus
california,
which
your
honors
remember,
the
supreme
court
of
california
sent
a
case
to
this
court,
sent
copies
of
its
decision,
i
believe
in
modesto
--
people
versus
modesto.
i
believe
justice
brennan
will
recall
during
the
oral
argument
he
called
the
attention
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
trying
to
prejudge
this
court
action.
after
this
court
passed
on
griffin
versus
california
and
reversed
griffin
on
the
basis
of
comments
by
the
prosecutor
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
take
the
stand,
california
again
repetition
this
court
or
rehearing
which
was
denied
and
raised
this
question
of
the
harmless
error
rule.
now,
again
we
have
in
chapman
and
teale
versus
california
the
question,
the
admitted
the
fact
that
throughout
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor
there
were
complete
comments
by
the
prosecutor
on
the
failure
of
the
defendants
plural
to
take
the
witness
stand
and
this
court
has
set
forth
for
a
decision
by
this
case
whether
the
violation
of
griffin
versus
california,
number
609
was
error,
cannot
be
harmless
in
this
case
and
so
i
will
meet
both
of
those
questions
on
those
so
to
speak.
first
of
all,
i
think
there
is
own
case
that
your
honors
have
had
before
you
where
there
has
been
such
a
replete
and
continues
argument
on
the
failure
of
a
defendant
to
take
the
witness
stand.
the
--
in
this
case,
the
very
briefly
the
facts
are,
did
the
bartender
was
found
dead
in
a
gulley
on
october
18,
1963
and
at
the
time
of
his
having
been
found
there,
the
state
traced
back
the
case
and
commenced
the
prosecution
arresting
mrs.
chapman
on
october
26
and
bring
her
back
and
taking
her
statement,
taking
her
to
the
district
attorney's
office
where
she
made
an
84-page
statement
as
of
1963,
it
was
october
18,
1962.
the
--
she
was
taken
to
the
district
attorney's
office
and
there
she
was
questioned
extensively
and
made
an
84-page
statement
without
the
benefit
or
advice
of
counsel.
while
the
statement
itself
was
that
--
has
reduced
in
evidence.
she
was
urged
to
see
a
psychiatrist
and
the
district
attorney
secured
a
psychiatrist
to
see
her
and
his
testimony
before
the
court
was
largely
based
upon
this
84-page
statement
which
he
made
to
the
district
attorney.
now,
the
prosecutor
went
back,
mr.
ferguson
who
was
the
deputy
district
attorney
went
back
to
pick
up
teale
after
he
was
arrested
on
november
2
and
thereafter
came
back
with
teale
who
was
placed
in
a
cell
with
another
man
who
later
became
a
witness
against
teale.
but
neither
chapman
nor
teale
took
the
witness
stand.
they
stood
on
their
constitutional
rights
both
defendants
were
indigent.
the
supreme
--
the
court
appointed
counsel,
the
public
defender
was
first
appointed
and
later
got
relieved
because
of
a
conflict
of
interest
and
these
two
gentlemen
were
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
the
defendants
in
the
trial.
mr.
richard
johnson
who
sits
here
was
the
former
assistant
district
attorney
in
san
joaquin
county
and
the
other
lawyers
and
immanent
lawyer
of
the
bar
there
and
they
saw
the
case
through
the
supreme
court
of
california.
now,
upon
their
advice
and
on
the
advice
of
their
counsel,
neither
one
of
these
defendants
took
the
witness
stand
but
the
prosecutor
kept
repeatedly
buttressing
his
case
where
he
lack
proof
with
arguments.
now,
these
people
could
tell
you
what
they
chose
not
to
testify.
it
would
take
me
nearly
all
of
my
time
that
to
read
some
of
these
comments
but
i'm
going
to
read
a
few
just
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention
the
many
places
in
this
lengthy
record
where
the
defendants
were
found
guilty
on
the
basis
of
comments
by
the
prosecutor
and
later
by
the
direction
of
the
court
that
they
could've
taken
the
stand
and
if
they
did
not
then
that
the
jury
could
draw
from
that
fact
the
inference
that
they
were
guilty.
on
page
20
of
my
opening
brief,
i
set
forth
ruth
chapman
is
sitting
right
over
here.
she
is
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
and
she
is
the
one
who
certainly
if
anyone
in
this
room
or
in
this
state
knows
what
was
in
those
boxes,
she
is
the
one.
but
once
again
she
did
not
take
the
stand,
raise
her
right
hand
and
tell
you
about
that.
she
didn't
take
the
stand
at
all
ladies
and
gentlemen.
she
could've
come
up
and
tells
you
--
us
exactly
what
articles
were
set.
so,
you
may
draw
any
inferences
from
that
that
you
wish
as
long
as
they
are
reasonable.
now,
we
come
first
of
all
to
the
issue
of
the
gun
and
the
gun
that
was
used
or
the
guns
that
were
used
allegedly
in
the
murder.
now,
the
prosecutor
says,
he
doesn't
know
which
gun
was
used
and
they
brought
neither
of
the
guns
that
were
allegedly
apart
of
this
transaction
were
ever
found
by
the
prosecutor
brought
in
similar
guns
or
guns
that
were
suppose
to
be
like
those
that
were
used.
and
now,
the
prosecutor
then
argues
here.
he
says
that
now,
page
1808
of
the
reporter's
transcript
and
incidentally
the
transcript
was
not
transcribed
but
you
have
the
copy
of
the
original
record
here
in
the
clerk's
office.
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
i
don't
know
which
one
of
these
weapons
was
purchased
first.
i
don't
know
that
it
particularly
makes
any
difference
but
as
you
know
we
have
had
no
testimony
at
all
in
that
regard.
in
fact,
i
might
add
that
the
only
person
or
persons
i
could
give
testimony
in
that
regard
would
be
of
course
the
defendants
themselves.
so,
we
don't
know
when
they
were
purchased
or
rather
we
know
the
date
but
we
don't
know
the
exact
time
or
what
sequence
was
for
this
i
refer
to
here
for
the
record
people's
exhibit
number
14,
there's
32
caliber
pistol
which
was
purchased
by
the
defendant
ruth
elizabeth
chapman.
now,
he
says
they
don't
have
the
weapon
but
they've
got
a
replica
there.
now,
he
says
they
can't
tell
what
he
goes
on
at
some
pages
of
argument
and
that
he
says
they
can't
tell
which
weapon
was
used
and
they
don't
know
but
the
defendants
if
they
took
the
stand
could
tell
the
court
which
weapon
was
used.
so,
he
says,
it's
a
constitutional
right
in
both
of
these
defendants
see
to
fit
to
avail
themselves
of
that
constitutional
right.
but
i
say
to
you
ladies
and
gentlemen,
there
are
many
things
in
this
case
and
i
will
try
to
point
them
out
to
you
at
least
probably
not
all
that
these
defendants
are
in
a
position
to
take
that
stand
and
to
testify
under
oath
and
give
you
facts
concerning.
they
have
not
seen
fit
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity.
then
again,
he
says,
now
up
to
this
point
page
1824
of
the
reporter's
transcript,
i
appeal
that
the
testimony
clearly
shows
that
the
defendants,
number
one,
there
is
motive,
not
in
necessity
item
to
the
crime
at
all
but
only
helpful,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
committed
it
and
then
he
talks
about
a
check
that
was
passed
without
sufficient
funds
and
he
says,
later
on
at
page
1826.
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
reference
to
the
weapons
being
purchased
in
reno,
nevada
on
october
12
you
have
heard
ladies
and
gentlemen
no
testimony
and
you
will
recall
clearly
you
were
going
to
have
some
difficulty,
you
really
are
as
reference
to
what
is
and
what
is
evidence
in
this
case
and
believe
me
i
have
a
few
comments
to
say
on
that
a
little
later
on.
but
if
you
will
recall
as
far
as
evidence
is
concerned
or
of
the
truth
of
anything
at
all,
you
don't
have
any
evidence
on
why
these
pistols
were
purchased?
why
did
ruth
elizabeth
chapman
buy
two
weapons?
well,
you
do
recall
that
she
told
on
one
occasion
that
she
had
a
piston
stolen
from
her
vehicle
and
when
she
was
taking
a
little
trip
across
the
country,
you
remember
that
testimony
and
then
i'm
skipping
now.
then
he
says
--
then
he
says,
but
certainly
the
defendant
ruth
elizabeth
chapman
could
tell
you,
she
could
tell
you
one
under
oath.
she
could
subject
herself
to
cross-examination
and
she
could
tell
you
then
and
it
would
evidence
before
you.
once
again,
she
has
not
chosen
to
do
this.
so,
any
inference
you
may
draw
there
from
will
be
an
adverse
inference
under
the
circumstances
and
under
the
instructions
of
a
court,
you
are
exclusive
judges
of
the
fact
themselves.
and
i
could
continue
on
and
i
have
quoted
several
of
these
other
passages
in
my
brief
and
then
the
comments
on
teale,
page
1854
of
the
record
of
the
comments
on
--
mr.
morris
lavine
what
is
that
your
honor?
mr.
morris
lavine
yes.
that
is
the
point
i'm
coming
to,
your
honor,
but
i
have
to
lay
predicate
to
show
the
character
of
these
comments.
so,
we're
to
supply
what
the
prosecution
was
unable
to
prove
in
the
case.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
has
ever
held
that
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
is
harmless
error
and
we
come
to
the
point
that
your
honor
has
just
raised
in
the
matter.
i
wanted
to
lay
the
predicate,
your
honor,
of
the
terrific
amount
of
comments
made
throughout
to
show
just
how
the
prosecutor
supplied
the
absence
of
proof
that
was
his
burden
by
comments
by
him
as
to
the
failure
of
the
defendants
to
take
the
witness
stand
and
to
supply
what
the
griffin
case
says
cannot
be
supplied
to
use
the
silence
of
the
defendant
as
the
basis
of
conviction.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
your
honor.
my
--
my
interpretation
of
griffin
as
your
honors
laid
it
down
was
that
silence
could
not
be
use
to
supply
an
evidence
and
that
the
silence
of
the
--
mr.
morris
lavine
what
is
that
your
honor?
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
as
i
interpreted
griffin
your
honor,
that
was
the
import
of
the
griffin
case.
i
--
i
have
been
wrestling
with
that
principle,
your
honor,
since
adamson
versus
california
18
years
before
when
justice
black
in
a
very
illuminating
dissent
and
very
wonderful
dissent
that's
read
in
all
the
law
schools
today
stated
the
position
that
this
court
has
now
taken
in
griffin
versus
california.
in
adamson,
we
started
18
years
ago
where
the
comment
of
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
morris
lavine
no,
it
does
not
argue
that
there
was
a
violation
of
griffin.
it
argues
whether
it
was
harmless
error.
now,
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
your
honor.
i
argue
two
possessions
in
connection
with
this
matter.
first,
i
argue
that
being
a
constitutional
violation,
being
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
that
it
cannot
be
deemed
to
be
harmless
error
that
this
court
has
never
said
in
any
of
its
cases
that
error
of
this
--
of
a
constitutional
proportion
was
harmless
error.
now,
i
go
back
to
your
earlier
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
you're
--
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
arguing
if
those
are
the
constitutional
point
that
it's
not
a
slight
incontestable
point.
mr.
morris
lavine
no.
mr.
morris
lavine
no.
i'm
arguing
that
if
it's
a
constitutional
violation
it
can't
be
an
isolated
point.
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
right
your
honor.
if
it
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
i
can't
define
it
on
the
basis
on
what
you're
defining
harmless
error,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
it
does
not
--
it
cannot
be
--
mr.
morris
lavine
harmful,
i
--
mr.
morris
lavine
may
i
answer
your
honor
in
the
language
of
bollenbach
case
and
to
state
my
position?
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
i
do
but
i
want
to
answer
your
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
my
argument
is
that
error
of
a
constitutional
proportion
i
have
to
argue
with
you
on
this
point
justice
black
because
i
can't
--
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
arguing
that
errors
of
a
constitutional
proportion
cannot
be
slight,
trifling
or
infinite
testable
or
de
minimis
lex
that
argue
--
that
errors
of
a
--
for
instance
denial
of
the
right
of
counsel
is
a
constitutional
right.
we
can't
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
who
doesn't
have
counsel
is
so
slight
if
he
has
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that's
not
this
case
but
i'm
citing
various
constitutional
principles.
i
am
saying
i
cannot
see
any
case
where
a
defendant
refuses
to
testify
on
constitutional
ground
can
be
a
slight
error
where
he
stands
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
say
that
--
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
can't
see
--
i'm
not
arguing
that
your
honor.
i'm
arguing
--
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
arguing
that
error
of
a
constitutional
side
can
never
be
so
slight
or
trifling.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
that
you
can
overlook
it
and
i
can't
find
any
case
as
i
have
found
where
this
court
has
held
where
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation
that
it
is
slight
or
trifling.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that's
right.
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
right,
your
honor.
that's
my
position.
now,
in
bollenbach
versus
united
states
back
in
1945
a
jury
was
out
seven
hours
and
the
judge
called
the
jury
back
in
to
give
them
another
instruction.
this
is
326
u.s.
of
page
607,
the
court
there
after
calling
the
jury
back
gave
them
further
instructions
which
it
was
held
it
was
erroneous.
the
evidence
apparently
from
the
standpoint
of
the
government
and
possibly
from
the
standpoint
of
the
court
was
regarded
as
the
overwhelming,
but
in
any
event,
this
court
laid
down
what
is
my
position
here
in
respect
to
the
situation
as
to
what
maybe
called
harmless
error.
the
government
argues
that
the
sting
of
error
is
extracted
because
there
was
proof
other
than
the
erroneous
presumption
on
the
issue
of
bollenbach's
participation
and
i'm
skipping
some
things
that
would
be
along
jump
at
guessing
to
be
confident
that
the
jury
did
not
rely
on
the
erroneous
presumption.
the
charge
should
not
be
misleading,
legal
presumptions
involve
settled
conception
to
which
not
even
judges
always
bring
clear
understandingly.
we
cannot
treat
the
manifest
misdirection
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
one
of
those
technical
errors
which
do
not
affect
the
substantial
rights
of
the
parties
and
must
be
disregarded.
all
law
is
technical
if
viewed
solely
from
the
concern
for
punishing
crime
without
hitting
the
mode
which
is
accomplished,
the
technical
errors
against
which
congress
protected
jury
verdicts
are
of
a
kind
which
led
some
judges
to
trivialize
law
by
giving
all
legal
prescriptions
equal
potency,
see
taft
and
so
forth.
deviations
from
formal
correctness
do
not
touch
the
substance
of
the
standards
by
which
guilt
is
determined
in
our
court
and
under
these
that
congress
rendered
harmless
citing
bruno
versus
united
states
and
wyler
versus
united
states
presuming
to
often
that
all
errors
to
be
prejudicial
the
judicial
pendulum
need
not
swing
to
presume
all
errors
to
be
harmless
if
only
the
appellate
court
is
left
in
doubt
without
doubt
that
one
who
claims
that
correct
due
process
is
after
all
guilty.
in
view
of
the
place
of
importance,
the
trial
by
jury
has
in
our
bill
of
rights.
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
congress
intended
to
substitute
the
belief
of
appellate
judges
in
the
guilt
of
an
accused.
however,
justifiably
engendered
by
the
dead
record
for
ascertainment
of
guilt
by
a
jury
under
appropriate
judicial
guidance
however
cumbersome
that
process
may
be
and
the
judgment
in
that
case
was
reversed.
now,
the
court
there
laid
down
the
standard
that
i
think
is
the
standard
that
i'm
urging
on
this
court
in
the
question
of
harmless
error.
now,
in
bruno
versus
united
states,
in
308
u.s.
october
term
1939,
page
293,
the
court
there
said
a
subsidiary
question
remains
for
determination.
it
derives
from
the
act
of
february
26,
1919
whereby
appellate
courts
are
on
their
duty
in
criminal
as
well
as
civil
cases
to
regard
that
--
disregard
technical
errors,
defects
or
exceptions
which
do
not
affect
the
substantial
right
to
the
party.
is
this
regard
of
the
right
which
congress
came
to
bruno
an
error?
the
commission
of
which
we
may
disregard
we
hold
not.
it
would
be
idle
to
predetermine
the
scope
of
such
remedial
provisions
of
section
391
by
anticipating
the
myriad
varieties
of
rulings
made
in
trial
in
attempting
to
abstract
include
definitions
of
technical
errors.
suffice
to
this
to
indicate
when
every
student
behind
the
act
of
february
26,
1919
knows
that
act
was
intended
to
prevent
matters
concerned
which
mere
etiquette
of
trials
with
the
formalities
and
minutiae
or
procedure
from
touching
the
merits
of
a
verdict
of
a
different
order
of
importance
is
the
right
of
an
accused
to
insist
on
the
privilege
which
congress
has
given
him
and
to
paraphrase
that
expression
of
a
different
order
of
importance
is
the
right
of
an
accused
to
insist
on
the
privilege
which
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
has
given
to
him.
to
suggest
--
to
the
suggested
benefits
a
defendant
fails
to
take
the
stand
not
to
have
the
attention
of
the
jury
directly
to
that
effect,
it
suffices
to
say
that
however
difficult
it
maybe
to
exercise
enlightened
self
interest,
the
accused
should
be
allowed
to
make
his
own
choice
when
an
act
of
congress
authorizes
him
to
choose
and
now
i
paraphrase
that
again
and
say
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
has
authorized
him
to
choose
and
whether
this
urged
that
it
is
a
psychologically
impossibility
not
to
have
a
presumption
rights
of
the
minds
of
jurors
against
an
accused
who
fail
to
testify
to
sure
the
answer
is
that
congress
legislated
on
the
contrary
assumption
and
not
without
support
of
experience.
it
was
for
congress
to
decide
whether
it
was
deemed
legally
sufficient
what
was
psychologically
futile.
certainly,
despite
the
vast
accumulation
of
psychological
data,
we
have
not
yet
obtain
that
servitude
about
the
human
mind
which
would
justify
us
in
disregarding
the
will
of
congress
by
dogmatic
assumption
that
jurors
have
probably
is
--
properly
admonished
either
could
nor
would
he,
the
destructions
of
the
trial
court
that
the
failure
of
the
accused
to
be
a
witness
in
his
own
cause
shall
not
create
any
presumption
against
him.
and
there,
the
court
held
that
if
the
accused
asked
for
that
instruction
he
should
be
given
and
they
hold
that
that
is
a
substantial
question
which
ought
to
be
presented.
now,
in
the
case
of
wyler
versus
united
states,
your
honors
will
recall
that
was
a
case
involving
the
question
of
one
or
two
witnesses
in
a
perjury
case
and
the
court
there
held
that
the
two
witness
rule
was
still
required,
that
case
is
reported
in
323
u.s,
at
page
600
--
reading
from
page
611.
it
is
argued
that
this
error
did
not
prejudice
the
defendant.
we
cannot
say
that
it
did
not.
the
jury
convicted
without
being
instructed
that
more
than
the
testimony
with
single
witness
was
required
to
justify
their
verdict.
this
was
no
mere
technical
error
relating
to
the
formalities
and
minutiae
of
trial.
this
is
what
i
am
urging
justice
black
in
answer
to
your
question
that
there
maybe
formalities
in
minutiae
in
connection
with
the
trial
that
would
be
excused
but
if
it
was
a
constitutional
violation
as
all
of
your
cases
we
have
held
on
this
right
of
self-incrimination
it
is
not
the
mere
technical
error.
we
are
not
authorized
to
look
at
the
printed
record
result
conflicting
evidence
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
error
was
harmless
because
we
think
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
that
would
be
to
substitute
of
our
judgment
or
that
of
the
jury.
and
under
our
system
of
justice,
juries
alone
have
been
entrusted
with
that
responsibility
and
i
may
say
the
same
as
in
the
state
of
california
under
article
1,
section
7
as
it
existed
the
time
of
this
case
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
had
a
jury
trial.
it's
not
for
the
appellate
court
or
the
supreme
court
of
california
or
even
this
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
or
the
judgment
of
the
trial
jurors
who
see
the
witnesses
and
hear
the
witnesses
nor
are
we
compelled
to
conclude
that
this
error
was
harmless
because
of
actions
of
another
case
which
they
cited.
now,
that
this
case
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
its
own
facts.
now,
one
other
case
that
your
honors
decided
recently
was
the
case
of
stewart
versus
united
states
and
reported
in
366
u.s.
at
page
1.
in
that
case,
the
petitioner
was
tried
three
times
in
the
federal
court
for
murder.
the
first
two
trials,
he
didn't
take
the
witness
stand,
the
third
trial
he
did
and
he
was
asked
the
question
that
he
have
not
taken
the
witness
stand
on
the
earlier
two
trials.
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black
wrote
the
reversal
in
that
case
and
held
that
that
was
not
harmless
error.
you
held
that
it
was
error
to
ask
that
question
which
raised
the
question
of
the
defendant
not
having
taken
the
witness
stand.
and
so
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes.
page
9
of
the
printed
opinion,
the
government's
final
contention
is
that
the
use
of
error
was
prejudicial,
the
conviction
should
be
allowed
to
stand
on
the
theory
that
the
error
was
not
sufficiently
prejudicial
to
warrant
the
granting
of
a
mistrial
and
the
defense
made
no
request
for
cautionary
instruction.
so,
quoting
your
own
language
justice
black
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
what
else,
your
honor?
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
quoting
it
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
oh,
i'm
about
to
go
on
with
the
rest
of
the
opinion
as
you
reversed
it.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
your
honor.
one
answer
to
this
argument
is
to
be
found
in
the
government's
own
brief
for
in
its
argument
regarding
the
possibility
that
the
jury
may
not
have
been
aware
of
the
improper
question.
the
government
stresses
the
fact
that
the
question
was
not
emphasized
by
any
reference
to
what
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
during
the
course
of
this
argument,
the
government
expressly
recognizes
that
the
danger
of
the
situation
would've
been
increased
by
a
cautionary
instruction
in
that
such
of
instruction
would
have
again
brought
the
jury's
attention
to
petitioner's
prior
failure
to
testify.
plainly,
the
defense
was
under
no
such,
no
obligation
to
take
such
a
risk.
the
motion
for
mistrial
was
entirely
appropriate
and
indeed
necessary
to
protect
the
interest
of
petitioner.
we,
thus,
conclude
that
this
conviction
and
sentence
against
petitioner
cannot
stand.
in
--
in
doing
so,
we
agree
with
the
point
made
by
the
government
in
its
brief
that
it
is
regrettable
that
the
concurrent
finding
of
36
jurors
are
not
sufficiently
final
to
terminate
a
case
but
under
our
system
a
man
is
entitled
to
the
finding
of
12
jurors
on
evidence
fairly
and
properly
presented
to
them.
petitioner
may
not
be
deprived
his
right
until
that
right
is
accorded
him.
that
right
was
denied
here
by
the
prosecutor's
improper
question.
so,
i
submit
here
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
your
honor,
there's
been
no
error
--
no
case
as
i
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
if
your
honor
please,
that
was
one
of
the
points
that
the
government
raised
in
the
case.
you
should,
it
had
to
be
argued
because
your
honors
granted
certiorari
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
correct.
now,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
any
case
in
this
court
where
your
honor
has
pointed
to
any
case
or
where
any
decision
existed
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
this
court
where
there's
been
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
proportion
where
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
harmless
error.
i
have
cited
about
seven
cases
in
my
brief
involving
particularly
confessions
and
other
constitutional
violation.
but
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
of
which
says
that
the
failure
that
there's
any
situation
which
--
in
which
the
right
of
self-incrimination
has
been
brought
in
that
is
to
have
this
court
has
held
to
be
harmless
and
the
cases
i
have
cited,
i
think
are
in
support
of
that
position.
i
take
the
position
that
the
harmless
error
rule
was
not
meant
to
overlook
violations
of
constitutional
magnitude
and
i
think
that
in
this
case
looking
at
this
record
and
the
numerous
comments
by
the
prosecutor
as
planning
the
lack
of
proof
that
the
state
have
with
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor
constituted
the
error
highly
prejudicial
and
certainly
not
harmless
in
this
case.
so,
my
argument
is
two-fold.
first,
that
any
violation
of
griffin,
any
violation
of
failure
to
take
the
comment
on
the
failure
of
a
defendant
take
the
witness
stand
is
itself
error
that
requires
that
it's
a
constitutional
magnitude
and
therefore
does
not
come
within
the
harmless
error
rule
but
if
it
does,
the
repeated
and
constant
comments
on
this
case
make
the
error
of
such
magnitude
that
it
is
not
harmless
in
this
case
and
it's
very
highly
prejudicial.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
he
instructed
in
the
language
of
the
adamson
case,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
page
--
it's
referred
to
in
page
17
of
my
closing
brief
and
it's
referred
to
in
reporter's
transcript
page
2163
that
among
the
inferences
that
may
reasonably
be
drawn
there
from
those
unfavorable
to
the
defendant
are
the
more
probable.
now,
that's
the
abbreviation
of
the
entire
instruction
your
honor
but
the
instruction
is
in
the
language
of
the
prior
adamson
case
which
is
the
one
with
collegiate
standard
previously
standard
instructions
prior
to
the
adamson
case.
and
i
will
possibly
look
it
up
during
the
argument
of
my
opponent
to
give
you
the
full
text
of
it.
thank
you.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
has
stated
that
there
was
no
impact
upon
the
jury
in
connection
with
this
case
in
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor.
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
appendix
e
in
my
brief,
starting
at
page
92,
you
will
find
the
--
from
that
page
92
to
106
of
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
witness
stand
together
with
page
references
in
the
original
transcript
which
is
on
file
here.
it
would
take
more
than
the
time
i
have
allotted
to
me
to
read
all
of
these
comments.
i
just
read
a
few
of
them
yesterday.
counsel
misstates
the
statement
that
there
was
a
confession.
the
defendant
teale
talked
to
a
fellow
prisoner
in
jail.
he
said
he
--
they'll
have
a
hard
time
proving
i
was
there.
now,
then
this
is
the
extent
and
then
the
prosecutor
argued
page
1855
of
the
transcript
which
as
i
state
you
have
the
original
unfiled
in
the
basement
here
and
the
prosecutor
says,
“now,
i
don't
know
what
he
meant
by
that
statement.
i
certainly
can
draw
my
own
conclusion
and
you
sure
can
draw
yours.”
the
state
has
drawn
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
confession
apparently
but
anyhow,
the
prosecutor
argues
that
the
--
you
sure
will
draw
yours
and
as
triers
of
a
fact
and
the
judges
of
the
fact,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
that
once
again
mr.
teale
did
not
take
the
stand
and
testify
under
oath
in
this
case.
and
mr.
teale
has
not
desired
to
take
the
stand
and
explained
what
he
meant
by
it.
he

mr.

on
the

mr.

my
position
is
that
under

that
since
it
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
it
was
a
violation
of

mr.

well,
then
it
becomes
a
violation
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
a
fair
trial.
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
that's
my
contention.
now
i
raise
that
question
in
my
petition
for
certiorari,
the
question
of
fair
trial.
it
was
not
listed
among
the
issues
but
its
inherent
in
the
argument
here
today
your
honor
that
both
of
these
defendants
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
the
consequences
are
--
is
unfair
trial
your
honor.
the
consti
--
issue
becomes
a
second
issue
justice
white
of
whether
are
state
statute,
article
6,
section
4.5
as
it
then
existed
is
unconstitutional
in
limiting
the
application
of
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
my
position
your
honor
and
your
honors
and
i
thought
--
i
attempted
to
make
it
clear
yesterday
that
when
the
framers
of
our
constitution
had
to
implement
it
with
the
bill
of
rights
that
the
essential
portions
of
the
bill
of
rights
became
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
court
at
least
has
held
that
the
fifth
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment,
the
sixth
amendment
and
possibly
the
eighth
have
now
become
incorporated
by
the
rules
of
this
court,
by
the
opinions
of
this
court
as
a
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
my
position
your
honors
that
these
are
fundamental
errors
of
constitutional
magnitude
which
the
framers
of
our
constitution
and
the
persons
who
adopted
the
bill
of
rights
put
in
there
so
that
the
constitution
could
pass
and
that
--
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
they
did
in
their
first
opinion
your
honor
--
mr.
morris
lavine
--
and
then
later
they
amended
that
and
modified
it.
mr.
morris
lavine
well
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
and
particularly
in
this
case,
i
want
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
something
unusual
that
happened
in
this
case.
when
the
first
opinion
came
down,
the
court
--
the
california
court
apparently
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
this
comment.
on
page
55
of
my
brief
the
court's
opinion,
first
opinion
is
set
forth
as
stated,
neither
defendant
testified
in
his
or
her
own
behalf
in
the
exercise
of
their
constitutional
privilege.
this
failure
to
testify
was
not
commented
upon
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
but
the
court
in
instructions
to
the
jury
and
in
accordance
with
the
california
constitutional
provision
stated
among
other
things
that
the
failure
of
defendants
to
testify
from
facts
within
their
knowledge
and
explanation
of
incriminating
evidence
maybe
deemed
as
tending
to
indicate
the
truth
of
such
incriminating
evidence
and
that
among
the
inferences
that
may
reasonably
--
maybe
reasonably
drawn
there
from,
those
unfavorable
to
the
defendant
are
the
more
probable.
now,
immediately
there
was
a
petition
for
rehearing
file
calling
attention
to
the
court
that
they
had
overlooked
all
these
comments
which
i
have
called
your
honor's
attention
in
my
brief
from
pages
92
until
the
end.
so
they
then
adopted
and
--
a
modifying
opinion
in
which
they
acknowledged
that
they
were
wrong
and
set
forth
that
there
were
a
number
of
arguments
made
as
to
the
failure
of
the
defendants
to
take
the
stand.
in
fact
it
covers
two,
almost
two
printed
pages
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
the
foregoing
comments
and
instruction
have
been
ruled
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
griffin
versus
california,
malloy
versus
hogan
--
mr.
morris
lavine
59
and
60,
yes,
your
honor.
start
--
mr.
morris
lavine
no,
they
do
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
set
forth
those
very
matters
and
admit
them
in
their
respondent's
brief.
but
with
the
--
some
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
i
believe
that
the
respondent
has
admitted
in
its
brief
most
of
these
comments
but
i
have
set
them
forth
in
considerably
more
detail
and
mr.
chief
justice
you
asked
me
yesterday
about
the
instructions
of
the
court
to
the
jury
and
i
have
read
it
out
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
part
but
the
complete
instruction
is
contained
on
page
2163
of
the
typewritten
record
which
you
have
here.
mr.
morris
lavine
only
if
it
denied
fair
trial
as
this
court
has
construed
it
by
its
numerous
cases.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
because
as
i
read
the
--
as
i
read
the
history
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
go
back
to
an
opinion
written
--
a
dissenting
opinion
written
in
twining
versus
new
jerseyin
211
u.s.
at
page
114
by
then
mr.
justice
harlan
which
is
very
long
and
i
haven't
time
to
read
it
but
it's
about
100
--
about
12
pages
long
and
it's
very
full
and
gives
a
quite
a
history
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
he
viewed
as
being
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
morris
lavine
well,
that
is
right
but
you
--
but
i
still
--
but
you
asked
me
if
any
constitutional
error
per
se
becomes
automatically
a
harmful
error
and
i
say
that
it
does
because
it's
of
constitutional
magnitude
and
because
the
framers
of
our
constitution
insisted
in
the
formation
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
the
bill
of
rights
be
passed
before
they
would
agree
to
the
passing
of
the
constitution
and
nine
states
in
this
country
voted
for
the
bill
of
rights
because
--
and
the
constitution
was
passed
only
because
the
bill
of
rights
was
there
to
protect
the
people
in
those
fundamental
rights.
now,
what
are
those
fundamental
rights?
the
fourth
amendment,
unlawful
search
and
seizure
which
your
honor
has
in
the
next
case,
the
fifth
amendment,
self
incrimination,
the
denial
of
counsel,
illegally
securing
confession;
the
sixth
amendment,
denial
of
counsel.
can
we
name
any
right
that
is
guaranteed
by
the
consti
--
bill
of
rights
that
it
is
now
of
fundamental
error,
that
it
is
now
of
such
magnitude
that
the
mere
failure
to
observe
it
is
of
such
an
error
as
requires
its
recognition
and
that
any
rule
that
says
of
it
as
harmless
tries
to
limit
the
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
summing
up
in
this
case,
it
is
my
position
that
the
state
of
california
has
conceded
that
error
was
committed
in
this
case
by
the
numerous
comments
and
they
have
conceded
that
it
violated,
as
the
griffin
rule
and
the
malloy
versus
the
hogan
rule
exists
today.
they
would
turn
the
faucet
on
and
off.
they
say
it
was
harmless
yesterday
but
it's
harmful
today.
well,
such
a
view
cannot
be
taken
of
fundamental
error
such
as
an
existence
here
nor
all
these
pages
as
i
have
set
forth
in
from
page
92
on
in
my
brief.
now,
there
is
a
little
comment
that
was
made
in
an
opinion
written
here
sometime
back
in
miller
versus
the
territory
of
oklahoma
which
was
adopted
by
our
court
and
people
versus
glass,
the
seal
unrestrained
by
legal
barriers
of
some
prosecuting
attorneys
tempts
to
an
insistence
upon
the
admission
of
incompetent
evidence
or
getting
before
the
jury
some
extraneous
facts
suppose
to
be
helpful
in
securing
a
verdict
of
guilty
where
they
have
prestige
enough
to
induce
the
trial
court
to
give
them
latitude.
when
the
error
is
exposed
on
appeal,
it
is
about
whether
stereotype
argument
that
is
not
apparent
and
anywise
that
it
in
anywise
influence
the
minds
of
the
jury
just
as
your
honor
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
arguing
with
the
attorney
general
here
in
comment
to
the
attorney
general.
the
reply
the
law
makes
to
such
suggestion
is
that
after
injecting
it
into
the
case
to
influence
the
jury,
the
prosecutor
ought
not
to
be
heard
to
say
after
he
has
secured
the
conviction
it
was
harmless.
as
the
appellate
court
has
done
inside
in
--
to
the
deliberation
of
the
jury
room,
the
presumption
is
to
be
indulged
in
favor
of
the
liberty
of
the
citizen
that
whatever
the
prosecutor
against
the
protest
of
the
defendant
as
laid
before
the
jury
help
to
make
up
the
way
of
the
prosecution
which
resulted
in
the
verdict
of
guilty.
your
honors
will
find
that
on
page
6
of
my
closing
brief.
it's
adopted
in
people
versus
miranda
and
again
this
court
in
its
early
case
of
bram
versus
u.s.
also
have
the
language
that
is
quite
similar
that
the
court
cannot
say
after
it
has
come
in
that
it
is
harmless.
the
prosecutor
used
it
to
bring
a
conviction.
he
used
it
to
lead
the
jury
to
infer
the
guilt
of
these

on

of
inferring
to
the
guilt
of
these
defendants
that
the
court

the
jury
in
language
that

them
they
could
do
that
respectfully.
thank
