mr.
fletcher
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
arkansas
statute
was
enacted
in
1961,
this
was
four
years
after
roth
and
kingsley's
books.
the
statute
was
drawn
with
those
two
cases
in
view.
they
took
the
definition
verbatim
from
roth.
the
--
roth
allowed
the
criminal
action.
as
to
several
proceedings,
they
went
from
kingsley's
books
and
they
aid
one
additional
safeguard,
there's
no
injunction
pendente
lite.
there
is
no
restraint
under
the
statute
until
there's
been
judicial
determination
of
obscenity.
in
freedman
versus
maryland,
you
all
point
out
that
kingsley
could
service
a
month,
this
is
the
way
the
arkansas
statute
is
setup.
it's
an
even
--
more
safeguards
for
first
amendment
rights
than
in
kingsley's
books.
there's
about
25
other
states
which
have
similar
statutes
where
you
get
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
obscenity
and
then
get
an
injunction.
some
of
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
25,
sir?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
twenty-five.
twenty-five
if
our
statute
follows
they
would
surely
follow
because
our
statute
doesn't
have
any
provision
for
any
restraint
before
termination.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that's
so
and
probably
they
do,
most
of
them,
i
believe
they
use
blanket
word
of
obscenity,
indecency
and
so
forth.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
this
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
they
could
be
added
in
this
case.
they
could
have
asked
for
an
instruction
to
that
effect
and
to
add
it
and
they
took
this.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
statute
does
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
even
in
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
isn't
that
element
of
lack
of
social
value
implied
in
the
roth
definition
having
you
all
re-approve
roth,
the
definition
in
saying
that
it
includes
this.
there
was
a
lack
of
social
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
oh,
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
but
--
neither
is
the
thing
about
adding
defensiveness.
but
if
ever
--
every
time
you
add
an
element
by
a
decision,
the
legislature
would
affirm
that
to
add
another
sentence
into
this
definition.
the
order
--
since
consistently
approved
this
language
here
from
roth,
even
though
you
do
seem
to
add
other
elements.
these
other
elements
will
have
to
come
in
under
instructions
as
for
the
jury.
there's
no
way
you
could
--
just
keep
adding
sentences
to
each
time
the
legislature
amends.
now(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
just
the
word
saint.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that
would
be
one
way
to
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
but
i
think
that
what
our
legislature
did
was
--
is
permissible.
is
to
--
definition
that
you'll
continually
refer
to
even
though
you'll
say
--
the
court
says
to
construe
it
differently
as
to
include
other
elements.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
what?
they
could
--
they
construed
the
word
obscene
as
to
in
--
as
it
is
here
to
include
the
lack
of
social
value
and
that
an
offensiveness.
they
could
be
so
instructed
to
the
jury
if
requested.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it's
not
inconsistent
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that
it
was
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
just
advisory
jury,
yes
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
are
the
court
itself,
it
--
hears
it
by
itself.
it
could
be
advised
as
to
--
considered
the
three
elements
at
most
coalesce.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
doesn't
require
but
they
could
be
added
into
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
was
never
asked
to
do
so.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
instructions
given
were
the
definition
of
obscenity
--
the
appellants
here
never
asked
for
any
instructions
as
to
include
the
element
of
--
having
an
offensive
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
they're
not
in
--
did
they
--
put
you
from
the
front
of
the
record?
this
--
1909
in
the
printed
record
but
there
is
no
instruction
as
to
lack
of
social
value.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
what
this
case
--
what
came
up
under
the
several
proceedings
of
the
statutes,
we
have
a
twin
weapons
here.
we
have
a
civil
and
criminal
proceedings
and
as
to
our
civil
proceedings
is
from
the
last
two
cases
today
this
could
solve
some
of
this
scienter
problems.
because
here
you
have
to
--
in
any
criminal
prosecution,
you're
going
to
have
to
show
knowledge
of
contents
under
our
statute
and
you're
also
going
to
have
to
show
either
that
2907
has
turn
it
down
or
that
it
has
been
judicially
determined
to
be
obscene
in
an
arkansas
proceeding.
plus,
they
knew
it
was
--
had
been
so
adjudicated.
you've
really
got
some
scienter
provisions
here
that
are
no
funds
than
any
other
state
and
protecting
first
amendment
rights
and
fourteenth
as
--
incorporating
the
fourteenth.
this
law
was
carefully
drafted
in
roth
and
kingsley's
books.
they
tried
to
put
as
many
safeguards
as
they
could
to
bail
it.
basic
safeguard
is
the
definition
on
mailable
matter
and
non-mailable
matter.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you
--
the
start
--
the
proceedings,
the
prosecuting
attorney
would
have
to
have
reasonable
cause
where
the
statute
reads
that
respondent
had
knowledge
of
the
contents.
that's
set
out
in
section
5
which
talks
about,
you
know,
bringing
the
action.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
come
to
that
is
the
civil
action
under
section
5,
whatever
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
any
county
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
any
person
with
knowledge
of
his
current
offense
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
would
--
in
the
appellant's
appendix,
it
would
be
on
page
22.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
was
--
being
section
41-2717
is
the
first
sentence
after
the
title.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
this
is
to
bring
the
action,
to
get
the
judicial
determination.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it's
the
commencement
of
the
action.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
and
you
have
knowledge
of
contents
and
as
far
as
pandering
and
so
forth,
that
would
probably
an
element
as
to
--
that
could
be
proved
during
a
civil
trial
too,
as
well
as
in
the
criminal.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no
requirement,
no
sir.
you
just
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
prove
the
elements
of
roth.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
has
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
would
assume
--
as
far
as
not
in
the
content
you
wouldn't
have
any
problem
as
to
publisher-distributor.
the
problem
there
is
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
obviously,
yes
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you
have
to
show
that
he
published
--
to
bring
a
civil
action
to
get
--
to
get
a
declaration,
you'd
have
to
have
a
prosecutor
attorney
bring
the
action.
you'd
have
to
have
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
any
person
with
knowledge
of
its
contents
is
engaging
and
bringing
in
of
--
or
in
this
--
or
in
arkansas
publishing
and
preparing
obscene
mailable
matter.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
there's
no
scienter
as
far
as
the
--
that
was
scienter
would
come
in
after
the
determination
as
far
as
the
knowledge
of
obscenity
of
the
product
itself.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
engaged?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that's
the
way
that
the
action
is
commenced,
i
mean
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
fact
of
the
thing
is
that
--
and
first,
that
--
since
you
have
a
judicial
declaration
that
the
matter
is
obscene.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
then
in
addition,
you
can
--
and
whereas,
it
was
done
here,
you
can
enjoin
this
acts
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
your
mens
rea
would
come
after
the
judicial
declaration.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
alright.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
under
the
criminal
provisions,
if
he
had
knowledge
of
the
judicial
(voice

--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir
under
section
4
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
section
4,
the
--
under
what
the
others
--
if
the
others,
41
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
it
can
proceed
under
or
proceed
--
or
attempt
proceedings.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
i
interpret
the
first
section
of
that,
this
--
the
two-part
reveals
what
position
but
the
first
seems
deal
in
selling
or
dealing
or
giving
a
way
of
obscene
matter,
it
would
be
in
the
business,
most
of
it.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you
got
the
other
element
--
you
also
got
the
knowledge
of
can
say
of
the
knowledge
that
it
has
judicially
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
--
fair
to
be
obscene?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
to
knowledge
of
content,
that's
in
the
first
sentence
of
very
person
who
had
knowledge
of
its
contents
sent
or
causes
to
send
in
to
arkansas
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
or
you'd
definitely
had
to
prove
as
--
(inaudible)
you
have
to
show
knowledge
of
contents
or
(inaudible)
to
show
us
that
it's
just
the
prosecutor's
belief.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
he
has
to
prove
these
elements.
one,
that
the
person
had
knowledge
of
the
contents.
two,
that
they
are
sending
or
you
know,
for
sale
and
so
forth
into
the
state
this
obscene
matter.
he's
got
to
show
that
it
was
either
--
other
than
mailable
matter
or
that
it
was
mailable
matter
known
by
such
person
to
have
been
judicially
found
to
be
obscene.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
or
it
just
got
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
he'd
have
to
show
like
a
--
an
affirmative
showing
of
knowledge
of
contents.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
publisher?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you'd
have
to
show
that
he
was
--
to
prove
by
showing
he's
supervised
the
printing
or
he
read
it
before
publication.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that
would
show
knowledge
of
contents,
wouldn't
it?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you'd
still
have
to
prove
mens
rea
in
--
even
under
number
one,
you'd
have
to
show
intent,
intent
to
sell
or
distribute
these
obscene
matters
if
you
have
to
show
mens
rea
even
under
this.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
my
point
was
sir
that
this
judicial
determination
will
put
a
publisher
or
a
distributor
of
a
notice
that
this
matter
is
likely
to
found
of
--
that
it
is
obscene
in
the
civil
matter
and
he's
likely
to
be
found
obscene
in
a
criminal
matter.
in
other
words,
it
gives
him
--
what
problem
as
yesterday
in
one
of
those
cases
was
that
knowledge
of
contents
and
knowledge
that
the
material
was
obscene.
and
this
goes
a
little
bit
further
than
the
usual
statute.
towards
the
mailable
matter
and
non-mailable
matter,
the
great
book
of
all
publications
would
be
a
mailable
matter.
that
definition
of
mailable
matter,
the
--
be
part
it
makes
it
almost
completely
broad.
it
says
any
other
printed
or
written
matter
or
material
which
has
not
been
determined
to
be
non-mailable
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
that
was
the
definition
of
mailable
matter,
is
anything
that
has
been
given
a
second
class
permit
or
has
never
been
presented
to
the
post
office
for
determination.
that
would
leave
non-mailable
matters
s
to
something
that
has
been
excluded
by
the
post
office.
and
anything
that's
been
excluded
by
the
post
office,
that
would
be
this
--
in
effect,
same
as
a
judicial
determination
as
far
as
showing
you
all
later
a
scienter.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
definition
sir?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
all
of
them
are
mailable
matter,
yes
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
allows
publishers
and
distributors
to
rely
on
the
post
office
determination
as
their
--
you
know
basic
protection.
if
they
have
that
protection,
they're
pretty
well
safe
unless
it's
a
borderline
case.
the
main
thing
i
wish
to
stress
is
--
he
raises
the
prior
restraint
to
him.
and
really,
this
is
not
really
a
prior
restraint
case.
there
is
no
restraint
before
an
adversary
hearing.
there's
no
i
--
provision
for
an
injunction
pendente
lite.
you
can
only
have
--
you
can
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
can
only
ask
for
a
power
in
injunction.
and
a
power
injunction
can
only
be
given
after
judicial
determination.
we're
not
really
in
the
--
depends
on
where
a
prior
restraint
is.
but
here,
you
got
a
judicial
determination
before
there
is
any
restraint.
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
present
case,
the
testimony
shows
that
these
magazines
were
still
on
the
stand
after
the
suit
was
filed
all
up
to
judgment.
one
of
the
witnesses
bought
some
later
editions
before
the
final
trial
was
over.
these
magazines
until
they
were
ordered
--
ceased
were
never
taken
off
the
stand.
so,
the
issues
can
go
on
the
stand.
there's
really
not
much
restraint
here.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
only
way
i
understood
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
far
more
or
less
what's
happened
here?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
trip
to
washington
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
to
make
the
statute
effective,
the
only
way
it
can
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that's
--
in
fact,
we
can't
understand
why
they
appealed?
this
is
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
--
this
is
no
perfect
statute
they've
ever
have.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
books,
it
could
--
rather
different.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that
would
be
the
only
thing
it
would
show
us.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
you
are
short
the
way
it
--
the
order
is
finally
was
short
circuit
service,
the
process,
that
would
be
the
only
thing
which
i
can
see.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
assume
that
you
have
to
go
ahead
and
file
a
new
complaint
with
new
--
attached
new
exhibits
to
it
to
go
through
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
--
somewhat
the
same
processes.
you'd
have
to
have
another
hearing.
it
says
here
--
i
don't
know,
where
it
says,
“if
they
are
found
obscene,
you'd
have
to
have
another
full
scale
hearing.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
order
just
applies
to
say
(inaudible)
from
bringing
into
jefferson
county
for
sale
or
distribution
in
jefferson
county
in
order
to
--
you
know,
destroy
said
magazines
which
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
only
to
jefferson
county.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
it's
one
specific
issue.
it
names
in
the
decree
and
in
the
complaint
and
everything.
it
names
a
specific
issues
of
the
magazines
that
are
--
you're
quite
correct
that
--
this
is
about
as
good
a
statute
is
to
protect
first
amendment
rights
that
you
can
have.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
wouldn't
apply
to
other
issues,
it
would
just
be
the
specific
issues
that
have
been
determined
obscene
of
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
all
they
say
is,
it

mr.

look
at
(voice

--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
think
it
clarifies
matters
over
in
this
order
itself.
that
was
just
in
the
findings
of
--
in
the
last
paragraph
in
its
order
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
if
this
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
would
you
look
the
last
paragraph
sir,
in
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
in
the
decree.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
would
be
on
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it'd
be
on
page
30
of
the
record.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
is
further
considered,
ordered
and
decreed
defendants
are
hereby
notified
that
any
future
distribution
or
sale
of
above
magazines
which
are
of
like
obscene
character
comparable
to
the
above
issues
of
said
magazine
will
be
enjoined
and
here's
an
important
language
above
showing
that
said
magazines
are
obscene
that
which
will
have
to
have
a
new
trial.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
to
the
feature,
all
it
did
was
retain
jurisdiction
for
a
later
determination
as
to
the
obscenity
of
any
future
issues.
all
in
effect
it
does
is
--
it
would
short
circuit
as
to
service
of
process.
it
doesn't
really
matter
--
anything,
just
retain
the
jurisdiction
because
the
prosecuting
attorney
will
have
to
go
through
the
same
steps
again
and
prove
the
obscenity
of
future
issues.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
he'd
have
to
start
a
new
action
(voice

--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
they
would
--
as
to
future
issues
and
future
--
i'd
say
that
march
or
april
issue
that
comes
out
next
month,
he
would
have
to
prove
obscenity
again.
that
if
have
to
another
full
adversary
hearing
before
they
could
be
of
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
far
as
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
is
construed
this
is
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
oh,
by
retaining
jurisdiction,
he
would
keep
them
in
court.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
another
hearing,
yes
sir,
another
hearing.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
mean
another
--
yes,
sir.
my
mistake
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
just
this
one
issue.
just
the
issues
that
are
named
in
there
is
the
only
ones
they
were
really
enjoined
from
(inaudible).
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think,
you'll
have
to
have
a
complete
new
hearing.
would
you
turn
to
page
18
of
my
brief
sir
and
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
page
18
of
the
--
brief
of
appellee
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
understand.
so
that
by
saying
as
to
the
--
you're
question
sir,
there,
the
--
in
the
middle
of
page
18
is
an
excerpt
from
the
arkansas
supreme
court
hearing
which
shows
the
fact
of
what
this
decree
is.
they
construed
this
chancellor's
decree
in
it's
--
it
says,
the
--
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything,
just
retaining
of
jurisdiction
unless
it
would
mean
the
--
as
to
service
of
process
and
having
them
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
that
would
mean
only
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
they
specifically
said
--
that
they
said
that
it
would
violate
--
i
think
the
court
in
near
versus
minnesota
said
it
would
violate
the
--
this
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
future
issue,
yes
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
that's
why
they
construed
the
chancellor's
decree.
they
knew
they
couldn't
enjoin
future
issues.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
arkansas
statute
was
enacted
in
1961,
this
was
four
years
after
roth
and
kingsley's
books.
the
statute
was
drawn
with
those
two
cases
in
view.
they
took
the
definition
verbatim
from
roth.
the
--
roth
allowed
the
criminal
action.
as
to
several
proceedings,
they
went
from
kingsley's
books
and
they
aid
one
additional
safeguard,
there's
no
injunction
pendente
lite.
there
is
no
restraint
under
the
statute
until
there's
been
judicial
determination
of
obscenity.
in
freedman
versus
maryland,
you
all
point
out
that
kingsley
could
service
a
month,
this
is
the
way
the
arkansas
statute
is
setup.
it's
an
even
--
more
safeguards
for
first
amendment
rights
than
in
kingsley's
books.
there's
about
25
other
states
which
have
similar
statutes
where
you
get
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
obscenity
and
then
get
an
injunction.
some
of
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
25,
sir?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
twenty-five.
twenty-five
if
our
statute
follows
they
would
surely
follow
because
our
statute
doesn't
have
any
provision
for
any
restraint
before
termination.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that's
so
and
probably
they
do,
most
of
them,
i
believe
they
use
blanket
word
of
obscenity,
indecency
and
so
forth.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
this
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
they
could
be
added
in
this
case.
they
could
have
asked
for
an
instruction
to
that
effect
and
to
add
it
and
they
took
this.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
statute
does
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
even
in
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
isn't
that
element
of
lack
of
social
value
implied
in
the
roth
definition
having
you
all
re-approve
roth,
the
definition
in
saying
that
it
includes
this.
there
was
a
lack
of
social
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
oh,
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
but
--
neither
is
the
thing
about
adding
defensiveness.
but
if
ever
--
every
time
you
add
an
element
by
a
decision,
the
legislature
would
affirm
that
to
add
another
sentence
into
this
definition.
the
order
--
since
consistently
approved
this
language
here
from
roth,
even
though
you
do
seem
to
add
other
elements.
these
other
elements
will
have
to
come
in
under
instructions
as
for
the
jury.
there's
no
way
you
could
--
just
keep
adding
sentences
to
each
time
the
legislature
amends.
now(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
just
the
word
saint.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that
would
be
one
way
to
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
but
i
think
that
what
our
legislature
did
was
--
is
permissible.
is
to
--
definition
that
you'll
continually
refer
to
even
though
you'll
say
--
the
court
says
to
construe
it
differently
as
to
include
other
elements.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
what?
they
could
--
they
construed
the
word
obscene
as
to
in
--
as
it
is
here
to
include
the
lack
of
social
value
and
that
an
offensiveness.
they
could
be
so
instructed
to
the
jury
if
requested.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it's
not
inconsistent
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that
it
was
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
just
advisory
jury,
yes
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
are
the
court
itself,
it
--
hears
it
by
itself.
it
could
be
advised
as
to
--
considered
the
three
elements
at
most
coalesce.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
doesn't
require
but
they
could
be
added
into
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
was
never
asked
to
do
so.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
instructions
given
were
the
definition
of
obscenity
--
the
appellants
here
never
asked
for
any
instructions
as
to
include
the
element
of
--
having
an
offensive
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
they're
not
in
--
did
they
--
put
you
from
the
front
of
the
record?
this
--
1909
in
the
printed
record
but
there
is
no
instruction
as
to
lack
of
social
value.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
what
this
case
--
what
came
up
under
the
several
proceedings
of
the
statutes,
we
have
a
twin
weapons
here.
we
have
a
civil
and
criminal
proceedings
and
as
to
our
civil
proceedings
is
from
the
last
two
cases
today
this
could
solve
some
of
this
scienter
problems.
because
here
you
have
to
--
in
any
criminal
prosecution,
you're
going
to
have
to
show
knowledge
of
contents
under
our
statute
and
you're
also
going
to
have
to
show
either
that
2907
has
turn
it
down
or
that
it
has
been
judicially
determined
to
be
obscene
in
an
arkansas
proceeding.
plus,
they
knew
it
was
--
had
been
so
adjudicated.
you've
really
got
some
scienter
provisions
here
that
are
no
funds
than
any
other
state
and
protecting
first
amendment
rights
and
fourteenth
as
--
incorporating
the
fourteenth.
this
law
was
carefully
drafted
in
roth
and
kingsley's
books.
they
tried
to
put
as
many
safeguards
as
they
could
to
bail
it.
basic
safeguard
is
the
definition
on
mailable
matter
and
non-mailable
matter.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you
--
the
start
--
the
proceedings,
the
prosecuting
attorney
would
have
to
have
reasonable
cause
where
the
statute
reads
that
respondent
had
knowledge
of
the
contents.
that's
set
out
in
section
5
which
talks
about,
you
know,
bringing
the
action.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
come
to
that
is
the
civil
action
under
section
5,
whatever
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
any
county
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
any
person
with
knowledge
of
his
current
offense
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
would
--
in
the
appellant's
appendix,
it
would
be
on
page
22.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
was
--
being
section
41-2717
is
the
first
sentence
after
the
title.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
this
is
to
bring
the
action,
to
get
the
judicial
determination.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it's
the
commencement
of
the
action.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
and
you
have
knowledge
of
contents
and
as
far
as
pandering
and
so
forth,
that
would
probably
an
element
as
to
--
that
could
be
proved
during
a
civil
trial
too,
as
well
as
in
the
criminal.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no
requirement,
no
sir.
you
just
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
prove
the
elements
of
roth.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
has
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
would
assume
--
as
far
as
not
in
the
content
you
wouldn't
have
any
problem
as
to
publisher-distributor.
the
problem
there
is
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
obviously,
yes
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you
have
to
show
that
he
published
--
to
bring
a
civil
action
to
get
--
to
get
a
declaration,
you'd
have
to
have
a
prosecutor
attorney
bring
the
action.
you'd
have
to
have
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
any
person
with
knowledge
of
its
contents
is
engaging
and
bringing
in
of
--
or
in
this
--
or
in
arkansas
publishing
and
preparing
obscene
mailable
matter.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
there's
no
scienter
as
far
as
the
--
that
was
scienter
would
come
in
after
the
determination
as
far
as
the
knowledge
of
obscenity
of
the
product
itself.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
engaged?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that's
the
way
that
the
action
is
commenced,
i
mean
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
fact
of
the
thing
is
that
--
and
first,
that
--
since
you
have
a
judicial
declaration
that
the
matter
is
obscene.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
then
in
addition,
you
can
--
and
whereas,
it
was
done
here,
you
can
enjoin
this
acts
(voice

--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher

your
mens
rea
would
come
after
the
judicial
declaration.
mr.
fletcher

yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher

yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher

alright.
mr.
fletcher

under
the
criminal
provisions,
if
he
had
knowledge
of
the
judicial

--
mr.

under

mr.

it
can

mr.
fletcher

the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
i
interpret
the
first
section
of
that,
this
--
the
two-part
reveals
what
position
but
the
first
seems
deal
in
selling
or
dealing
or
giving
a
way
of
obscene
matter,
it
would
be
in
the
business,
most
of
it.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you
got
the
other
element
--
you
also
got
the
knowledge
of
can
say
of
the
knowledge
that
it
has
judicially
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
--
fair
to
be
obscene?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
to
knowledge
of
content,
that's
in
the
first
sentence
of
very
person
who
had
knowledge
of
its
contents
sent
or
causes
to
send
in
to
arkansas
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
or
you'd
definitely
had
to
prove
as
--
(inaudible)
you
have
to
show
knowledge
of
contents
or
(inaudible)
to
show
us
that
it's
just
the
prosecutor's
belief.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
he
has
to
prove
these
elements.
one,
that
the
person
had
knowledge
of
the
contents.
two,
that
they
are
sending
or
you
know,
for
sale
and
so
forth
into
the
state
this
obscene
matter.
he's
got
to
show
that
it
was
either
--
other
than
mailable
matter
or
that
it
was
mailable
matter
known
by
such
person
to
have
been
judicially
found
to
be
obscene.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
or
it
just
got
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
he'd
have
to
show
like
a
--
an
affirmative
showing
of
knowledge
of
contents.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
publisher?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you'd
have
to
show
that
he
was
--
to
prove
by
showing
he's
supervised
the
printing
or
he
read
it
before
publication.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that
would
show
knowledge
of
contents,
wouldn't
it?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
you'd
still
have
to
prove
mens
rea
in
--
even
under
number
one,
you'd
have
to
show
intent,
intent
to
sell
or
distribute
these
obscene
matters
if
you
have
to
show
mens
rea
even
under
this.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
my
point
was
sir
that
this
judicial
determination
will
put
a
publisher
or
a
distributor
of
a
notice
that
this
matter
is
likely
to
found
of
--
that
it
is
obscene
in
the
civil
matter
and
he's
likely
to
be
found
obscene
in
a
criminal
matter.
in
other
words,
it
gives
him
--
what
problem
as
yesterday
in
one
of
those
cases
was
that
knowledge
of
contents
and
knowledge
that
the
material
was
obscene.
and
this
goes
a
little
bit
further
than
the
usual
statute.
towards
the
mailable
matter
and
non-mailable
matter,
the
great
book
of
all
publications
would
be
a
mailable
matter.
that
definition
of
mailable
matter,
the
--
be
part
it
makes
it
almost
completely
broad.
it
says
any
other
printed
or
written
matter
or
material
which
has
not
been
determined
to
be
non-mailable
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
that
was
the
definition
of
mailable
matter,
is
anything
that
has
been
given
a
second
class
permit
or
has
never
been
presented
to
the
post
office
for
determination.
that
would
leave
non-mailable
matters
s
to
something
that
has
been
excluded
by
the
post
office.
and
anything
that's
been
excluded
by
the
post
office,
that
would
be
this
--
in
effect,
same
as
a
judicial
determination
as
far
as
showing
you
all
later
a
scienter.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
definition
sir?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
all
of
them
are
mailable
matter,
yes
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
allows
publishers
and
distributors
to
rely
on
the
post
office
determination
as
their
--
you
know
basic
protection.
if
they
have
that
protection,
they're
pretty
well
safe
unless
it's
a
borderline
case.
the
main
thing
i
wish
to
stress
is
--
he
raises
the
prior
restraint
to
him.
and
really,
this
is
not
really
a
prior
restraint
case.
there
is
no
restraint
before
an
adversary
hearing.
there's
no
i
--
provision
for
an
injunction
pendente
lite.
you
can
only
have
--
you
can
--
the
prosecuting
attorney
can
only
ask
for
a
power
in
injunction.
and
a
power
injunction
can
only
be
given
after
judicial
determination.
we're
not
really
in
the
--
depends
on
where
a
prior
restraint
is.
but
here,
you
got
a
judicial
determination
before
there
is
any
restraint.
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
present
case,
the
testimony
shows
that
these
magazines
were
still
on
the
stand
after
the
suit
was
filed
all
up
to
judgment.
one
of
the
witnesses
bought
some
later
editions
before
the
final
trial
was
over.
these
magazines
until
they
were
ordered
--
ceased
were
never
taken
off
the
stand.
so,
the
issues
can
go
on
the
stand.
there's
really
not
much
restraint
here.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
only
way
i
understood
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
far
more
or
less
what's
happened
here?
mr.
fletcher
jackson
trip
to
washington
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
to
make
the
statute
effective,
the
only
way
it
can
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that's
--
in
fact,
we
can't
understand
why
they
appealed?
this
is
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
--
this
is
no
perfect
statute
they've
ever
have.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
books,
it
could
--
rather
different.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
that
would
be
the
only
thing
it
would
show
us.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
you
are
short
the
way
it
--
the
order
is
finally
was
short
circuit
service,
the
process,
that
would
be
the
only
thing
which
i
can
see.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
assume
that
you
have
to
go
ahead
and
file
a
new
complaint
with
new
--
attached
new
exhibits
to
it
to
go
through
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
--
somewhat
the
same
processes.
you'd
have
to
have
another
hearing.
it
says
here
--
i
don't
know,
where
it
says,
“if
they
are
found
obscene,
you'd
have
to
have
another
full
scale
hearing.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
the
order
just
applies
to
say
(inaudible)
from
bringing
into
jefferson
county
for
sale
or
distribution
in
jefferson
county
in
order
to
--
you
know,
destroy
said
magazines
which
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
only
to
jefferson
county.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
it's
one
specific
issue.
it
names
in
the
decree
and
in
the
complaint
and
everything.
it
names
a
specific
issues
of
the
magazines
that
are
--
you're
quite
correct
that
--
this
is
about
as
good
a
statute
is
to
protect
first
amendment
rights
that
you
can
have.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
wouldn't
apply
to
other
issues,
it
would
just
be
the
specific
issues
that
have
been
determined
obscene
of
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
all
they
say
is,
it
says,
found
above.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
look
at
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
think
it
clarifies
matters
over
in
this
order
itself.
that
was
just
in
the
findings
of
--
in
the
last
paragraph
in
its
order
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
if
this
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
would
you
look
the
last
paragraph
sir,
in
the
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
in
the
decree.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
would
be
on
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it'd
be
on
page
30
of
the
record.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
it
is
further
considered,
ordered
and
decreed
defendants
are
hereby
notified
that
any
future
distribution
or
sale
of
above
magazines
which
are
of
like
obscene
character
comparable
to
the
above
issues
of
said
magazine
will
be
enjoined
and
here's
an
important
language
above
showing
that
said
magazines
are
obscene
that
which
will
have
to
have
a
new
trial.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
to
the
feature,
all
it
did
was
retain
jurisdiction
for
a
later
determination
as
to
the
obscenity
of
any
future
issues.
all
in
effect
it
does
is
--
it
would
short
circuit
as
to
service
of
process.
it
doesn't
really
matter
--
anything,
just
retain
the
jurisdiction
because
the
prosecuting
attorney
will
have
to
go
through
the
same
steps
again
and
prove
the
obscenity
of
future
issues.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
he'd
have
to
start
a
new
action
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
they
would
--
as
to
future
issues
and
future
--
i'd
say
that
march
or
april
issue
that
comes
out
next
month,
he
would
have
to
prove
obscenity
again.
that
if
have
to
another
full
adversary
hearing
before
they
could
be
of
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
as
far
as
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
is
construed
this
is
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
oh,
by
retaining
jurisdiction,
he
would
keep
them
in
court.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
another
hearing,
yes
sir,
another
hearing.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
mean
another
--
yes,
sir.
my
mistake
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
just
this
one
issue.
just
the
issues
that
are
named
in
there
is
the
only
ones
they
were
really
enjoined
from
(inaudible).
mr.
fletcher
jackson
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think,
you'll
have
to
have
a
complete
new
hearing.
would
you
turn
to
page
18
of
my
brief
sir
and
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
page
18
of
the
--
brief
of
appellee
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
i
understand.
so
that
by
saying
as
to
the
--
you're
question
sir,
there,
the
--
in
the
middle
of
page
18
is
an
excerpt
from
the
arkansas
supreme
court
hearing
which
shows
the
fact
of
what
this
decree
is.
they
construed
this
chancellor's
decree
in
it's
--
it
says,
the
--
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything,
just
retaining
of
jurisdiction
unless
it
would
mean
the
--
as
to
service
of
process
and
having
them
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
that
would
mean
only
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
they
specifically
said
--
that
they
said
that
it
would
violate
--
i
think
the
court
in
near
versus
minnesota
said
it
would
violate
the
--
this
--
mr.
fletcher
jackson
future
issue,
yes
sir.
mr.
fletcher
jackson
yes,
sir.
that's
why
they
construed
the
chancellor's
decree.
they
knew
they
couldn't
enjoin
future
issues.
