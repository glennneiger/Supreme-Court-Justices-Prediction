mr.
h.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
arguments
today
are
addressed
to
the
questions
which
was
specifically
left
open
by
this
court
in
smith
against
california
and
once
again
in
michigan
last
year.
given
that
any
obscenity
prosecution
in
the
state
court,
requires
proof
of
the
element
of
scienter.
the
question
was
left
open
in
smith,
what
sort
of
mental
element
is
required.
the
second
question
left
open
in
smith
was,
“does
an
honest
mistake
concerning
the
obscenity
of
the
work
excused
from
criminal
liability?”
now,
in
new
york
our
statute
has
been
mentioned.
it
does
not
specifically
refer
to
scienter
as
an
element.
but
following
this
court's
decision
in
smith,
our
high
court
in
finkelstein
construed
our
statute
as
implicitly
requiring
proof
of
that
element.
and
ever
since
we
have
in
new
york
prosecuted
as
though
the
statute
quite
explicitly
required
proof
of
knowledge.
the
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
that
i
think
is
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
this
court
in
michigan
quoted
the
operative
language
from
finkelstein
and
in
fact
underlined
the
two
phrases
in
that
sentence
from
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
there
said
that
our
statute
requires
awareness
of
the
character
of
the
work.
that
it
is
not
innocent
but
calculated
prevails
of
obscenity
which
is
proscribed.
unfortunately
in
this
entire
area,
these
words
have
been
very
loosely
used
and
surprisingly
never
defined.
the
term
character
is
frequently
used
interchangeably
with
context.
i
dare
say
that
there
are
some
jurisdictions
which
feel
that
the
word
character
means
the
legal
character
of
the
work
but
i
suggest
that
it's
just
a
susceptible
of
the
construction
of
factual
character.
that
is
to
say
the
category,
the
type
of
work,
based
upon
those
objectively
discernible
characteristics
or
particular
a
piece
of
material.
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
if
they
intended
to
say
knowledge
of
what?
did
so
in
an
extremely
imprecise
fashion
and
i
think
the
conviction
and
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
this
case
illustrates
that
the
courts
of
new
york
have
not
interpreted
to
think
of
the
case
as
requiring
knowledge
of
the
obscenity
of
the
work.
it
is
our
submission
here
that
neither
did
smith
--
scienter
as
a
mental
element
traditionally
refers
to
knowledge
of
operative
fact.
indeed,
it
is
the
circumstances
which
is
susceptible
of
knowledge
by
the
ordinary
layperson
or
to
which
the
criminal
law
is
applicable.
i
dare
say
that
obscenity
itself
is
such
a
difficult
concept,
legal
conclusion
that
there
are
many
experts
in
this
field
who
themselves
would
hesitate
to
express
a
firm
knowledge
that
a
particular
work
was
obscene
because
what
is
involved
there
is
really
a
prediction
of
the
outcome
of
litigation
are
all
the
way
up
to
this
court.
and
in
as
much
as
this
court
has
disagreed
on
particular
pieces
of
work
with
reference
to
their
obscenity,
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
require
knowledge
of
obscenity
from
a
lawyer
let
alone
from
layperson.
of
course,
i
have
seen
knowledge
defined
and
broken
down
in
the
best
spectrum
of
degrees
of
knowledge.
all
the
way
from
an
accurate
certainty
through
negligence
to
inquire
down
to
perhaps
a
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
converse.
but
i
suggest
that
although
these
distinctions
between
different
types
of
knowledge
are
perhaps
interesting
from
an
academic
sense
that
they
are
virtually
impossible
to
apply
at
any
sort
of
standard
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
that
was
left
open
in
smith
is
not
precisely
phrased
as
what
sort
of
knowledge
but
rather
knowledge
of
what.
if
it
were
to
be
construed
as
knowledge
of
obscenity.
we
would
not
have
reached
the
result.
i
think
this
court
would
not
have
reached
the
result
it
did
in
the
ginzburg
case.
for
--
in
the
advertisements
of
the
material
in
that
case
which
were
accepted
at
face
value
by
the
court.
it
was
quite
clear
that
while
ginzburg
was
advertising
his
work
as
salacious
that
he
was
making
no
bones
about
it
according
to
appeal.
i
think
at
the
same
time
he
was
evidencing
his
own
belief
that
the
material
was
constitutionally
protective
and
therefore
not
obscene
because
in
point
of
fact,
he
stated
as
you
--
as
the
court
of
calls
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
an
it's
decision
has
specifically
allowed
the
distribution
of
that
sort
of
material.
consequentially,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
in
reaching
that
decision
was
implicitly
recognizing
the
fact
that
the
scienter
could
not
be
the
subjective
belief
in
obscenity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
to
honest
mistake,
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
the
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
am
--
i'm
very
tempted
to
agree
and
say
that
the
honest
mistake
was
specifically
rejected
by
that
holding
but
i
hesitate
only
on
the
grounds
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
an
honest
mistake
is.
the
extent
which
good
faith
figures
in
the
concept.
i
do
think
however
that
honest
mistake
as
to
obscenity
is
really
just
the
other
way
around
to
the
same
question
of
requiring
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
suppose
if
it's
not
honest
it's
not
a
mistake
and
if
there
is
an
honest
mistake
as
to
obscenity
which
excuses
then
you're
merely
stating
the
adverse
of
the
proposition
which
must
prove
that
the
person
knew
or
was
aware
of
the
obscene
quality
of
the
work.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
sense
the
second
question
of
smith
really
is
just
another
aspect
of
the
first.
this
court
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
in
an
analogous
first
amendment
case
referred
to
the
smith
question.
and
stated
that
what
was
required
by
smith
was
guilty
knowledge.
again,
following
this
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
garrison
against
louisiana
that
guilty
knowledge
was
construed
to
mean
a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
the
probable
falsehood
of
the
statement.
well
once
again,
they
would
seem
to
me
that
the
knowledge
of
falsehood
would
be
called
a
factual
sort
of
determination
and
not
a
prediction
of
the
legal
conclusion
and
therefore
this
own
court's
reference
to
the
smith
knowledge
is
factual.
indeed
despite
the
fact
that
the
sort
of
knowledge
was
left
as
an
open
question
there
in
the
body
of
the
smith
decision
itself
contents
are
referred
to.
another
analogous
area
of
course
is
the
area
of
subversion
and
thereto
this
court
has
looked
to
the
question
of
scienter.
and
has
required
not
only
knowledge
by
an
individual
adjoining
a
subversive
organization
of
its
purposes
but
a
shared
intent
in
those
unlawful
purposes
but
again,
this
was
a
factual
sort
of
scienter.
it
was
not
knowledge
that
if
he
engaged
in
this
conduct,
he
would
be
violating
the
law
that
it
would
be
subversion
but
only
the
espousal
of
the
purposes,
a
factual
determination.
the
petitioner
in
a
footnote
purports
to
recite
--
does
no
more
in
states
which
have
in
their
laws
construed
the
scienter
requirement
as
knowledge
of
obscenity.
however,
a
reference
to
those
cases
and
to
other
cases
and
those
jurisdictions
reveals
that
unfortunately
this
is
a
term
which
in
application
loses
its
significance.
in
california
for
example
which
one
of
the
jurisdictions
mentioned
by
the
petitioner.
there
is
a
case
which
part
explicitly
states
that
the
knowledge
of
obscenity
is
a
knowledge
of
contents
only
and
not
a
knowledge
of
legal
result.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
is
the
process
that
those
jurisdictions
would
follow.
and
i
think
that
it's
not
necessary
to
do
so.
as
you
pointed
out
the
facts
of
this
case
is
susceptible
of
our
conclusion
that
he
knew
the
facts
but
did
not
know
obscenity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
that
sense,
exactly,
and
the
same
with
ginzburg.
however,
those
states
which
have
attempted
to
apply
a
legal
standard
have
come
back
to
a
factual
standard
and
actual
operations.
and
i
think
necessarily
so.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
would
be
a
reasonable
doubt
i
think
if
his
knowledge
of
the
obscenity
even
if
the
court
were
unanimous
that
the
work
was
obscene.
if
the
standard
were
to
be
his
own
legal
appraisal
of
the
facts
that
he
knew
them.
and
that
is
to
say
a
defendant
were
presumably
in
good
faith
with
the
standards
being
as
flexible
as
they
necessarily
are
in
this
feel
that
something
was
not
obscene
where
any
court
in
the
land
would
disagree
with
it.
and
according
to
the
standard
which
is
here
proposed
he
could
acquit
himself
by
his
own
belief
an
his
innocence.
and
our
submission
to
this
court
that
this
proposition
is
normally
in
the
criminal
law,
a
man
cannot
be
his
own
judge.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
with
this
proposition
is
universally
accepted
i
think
that
the
only
question
is
what
is
a
good
faith
expression.
i
think
that
anything
which
is
deemed
a
good
faith
expression
is
certainly
protected.
if
the
material
in
this
case
comes
within
that
category
i
don't
think
that
we
need
even
reach
the
question
of
scienter
because
he
would
go
out
on
the
question
of
obscenity
as
defined
by
roth.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
absolutely.
his
belief
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
his
belief
could
not
convict
him.
if
he
had
a
manifested
bad
belief
by
advertising
the
work
and
such
then
presumably
that
conduct
on
his
part
would
have
some
effect
on
the
nature
of
the
material
itself
under
the
ginzburg
doctrine.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
it
is
not
out
there.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct,
justice
harlan.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
our
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
but
our
submission
is
that
the
--
whether
he
believed
they
were
obscene
or
believed
that
they
were
not
obscene
is
a
totally
irrelevant
consideration
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
that
the
questions
are
merely
two.
were
the
books
in
fact
obscene
and
did
he
have
some
awareness
of
the
facts
about
these
books
which
in
the
case
of
obscenity
is
something
which
is
objectively
perceivable?
you
have
a
written
material,
you
have
photographs,
you
have
a
physical
object
about
which
something
can
be
learned
even
by
a
layman.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
did
not
deny.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
said
he
didn't
recall
one
way
or
another.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
have
been
thinking
very
much
along
the
same
lines
myself
it's
a
novel
idea
in
the
field.
i
think
that
a
distinction
would
have
to
be
made
quite
sharply
between
knowledge
and
intent.
unfortunately
the
distinction
which
is
rarely
made
but
it
should
be
in
the
criminal
law,
i
think
that
as
to
knowledge
the
mental
element
of
knowledge
one
could
be
quite
content
with
a
factual
knowledge
as
to
mens
rea
or
intent.
what
we
would
be
doing
in
effect
is
converting
this
crime
into
a
crime
of
specific
intent.
the
problem
of
intent
as
the
commentators
have
noticed
in
field
very
frequently
is
the
type
of
intent
whether
it
would
be
general
or
specifically
it's
not
very
clearly
spelled
out
and
i
would
say
that
in
new
york
this
usually
thought
to
the
legislation
to
say
at
least
the
local
state
courts.
but
in
new
york
we
have
not
deem
this
to
be
a
crime
of
specific
intent.
however,
consistently
with
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
ginzburg
and
related
cases
i
can
easily
see
how
it
might
become
a
constitutionally
necessary
element
in
the
crime
to
prove
that
the
material
was
distributed
with
the
intent
to
appeal
the
prurient
interest
which
is
a
specific
intent
rather
than
a
general
mens
rea
sort
of
intent.
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
element
that
would
probably
be
imperceptible
of
proof.
your
honor,
mentioned
the
number
of
elements
in
this
particular
factual
situation
that
do
relate
to
it
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
think
back
to
the
ginzburg
and
michigan
to
see
the
contrary
so
with
the
facts.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i'm
relying
on
the
court's
decision
in
the
ginzburg
case.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
exactly.
well,
certainly
it
does
and
i
--
perhaps
answered
that
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that's
the
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
is
some
history
of
that
usually
a
minority
of
the
court,
chief
justices
written
long
before
ginzburg
along
that
line.
but
i
would
have
answered
somewhat
differently
a
greater
length
of
question
of
what
this
has
to
do
with
the
constitution,
mr.
stewart
in
this
fashion.
the
theory
of
smith
was
that
because
of
certain
inherent
and
necessary
vagueness
in
the
concept
of
obscenity
and
because
these
ambiguities
unfortunately
have
a
tendency
to
promote
self-censorship.
in
violation
of
the
spirit
of
the
first
amendment
it
is
necessary
to
so
far
delimit
the
area
of
prosecution
as
to
minimize
the
hazard
of
self-censorship.
and
that
the
first
amendment
requires
us
without
such
measures
as
will
minimize
the
hazard
of
self-censorship.
that
i
think
is
the
way
the
intent
factor
or
the
knowledge
factor
comes
into
the
field.
i
do
think
that
however
that
if
it's
elusory
to
believe
that
by
requiring
proof
to
come
back
to
knowledge
for
a
moment,
proof
of
knowledge
of
obscenity
as
a
means
for
minimizing
the
hazards
of
self-censorship,
we're
diluting
ourselves.
it
has
a
superficial
appeal.
if
you
think
of
the
very
hardest
core
pornography
they
very
rarely
any
doubt
that
anyone
who
sees
that
must
know
at
once
not
only
it's
facts
or
factual
character
of
it
but
also
that
it
is
obscene
in
proscribed
by
law.
consequently,
in
eliminating
prosecution
to
the
hardest
of
the
hard
called
pornography
but
which
perhaps
is
a
worthwhile
end
indeed
in
new
york,
our
law
has
been
construed
as
being
limited
to
prosecution
of
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
precisely
my
next
point.
unfortunately,
this
superficial
appeal
evaporates
when
you
see
in
the
way
in
which
it's
applied
because
just
as
to
one
person,
something
it's
unequivocally
hardcore
pornography
and
anyone
looking
at
it
should
have
known
that
it
was
obscene.
so
to
another
judge
to
another
court
are
something,
are
considerably
further
along
toward
the
border
is
just
as
unequivocally
pornographic
and
should
have
been
perceived
as
such.
consequently,
i
think
that
it's
elusory
to
think
that
we
can
limit
and
then
--
we
were
back
to
the
same
problem
of
the
definition
of
obscenity
and
the
fact
that
courts
differ
on
obscenity.
i
think
the
border
disputes
will
be
with
us
as
long
as
obscenity
is
an
exception
to
the
first
amendment.
i
do
think
however
that
it
may
be
constitutionally
preferable
to
look
at
it
in
terms
of
intent
now
that
we
have
the
ginzburg
decision
rather
than
in
terms
of
knowledge.
i
think
it
would
be
an
outrage
to
the
theory
of
the
criminal
law
to
require
that
anyone
prosecuted
for
a
crime
to
be
guilty
must
believe
in
his
own
guilt.
i
think
it
would
be
circular
to
define
pornography
as
that
which
anybody
looking
at
it
would
know
what's
pornography.
obviously,
the
circularity
of
that
definition
is
out.
consequently,
i
don't
think
that
the
constitutional
purpose
of
limiting
the
hazards
of
self-censorship
is
served
as
adequately
by
redefinition
of
the
traditional
concept
of
scienter
as
it
would
be
by
pursuit
of
justice
fortas'
suggestion
that
we
look
at
it
in
terms
of
scienter.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
terms
of
specific
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
specific
intent,
that's
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
for
me
to
argue
that
in
this
case
the
clerk
in
the
store
specifically
intended
to
appeal
the
prurient
interests.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
certainly
don't
think
that
that
fact
would
be
the
only
factor.
i
--
specific
intent
in
any
case
is
of
course
inferable
from
operative
facts
also.
again
in
the
sense,
you're
getting
back
to
a
factual
question.
if
this
police
officer
had
gone
up
to
a
$75.00
a
week
clerk
and
express
his
desire
for
reading
material
in
a
manner
other
than
by
just
naming
a
title
of
the
book
that
was
on
display,
asking
for
the
book
by
title.
expressing
his
desire
for
certain
type
of
book
or
movie
and
the
clerk
had
supplied
the
book
in
response
to
that
desire
i
think
it
might
be
reasonable
for
a
fact
finder
to
infer
the
intent
of
the
seller
was
to
ponder,
was
to
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
particular
customer.
it's
a
novel
theory,
justice
stewart
and
it's
extremely
difficult
to
try
and
visit
the
facts
that
might
fit
within
it.
if
i
were
to
be
completely
candid
i
would
probably
say
that
the
courts
in
applying
such
a
new
standard
would
pretty
much
come
around
to
the
same
results
that
they
have
now.
because
once
again,
it
would
be
felt
that
any
person
who
sold
or
distributed
or
displayed
the
material
which
the
court
feels
is
obscene
would
be
doing
so
with
the
intent
to
ponder
because
for
what
other
purpose
could
somebody
be
selling
something
that
is
obscene.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
–
the
people
against
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
yes,
it
--
i
don't
know
that
this
court
could
say
that
it's
unreasonable
for
a
fact
finder
to
infer
from
the
nature
of
the
book
that
was
sold.
that
the
sale
was
made
with
the
intent
to
ponder.
i
can
see
how
fact
finders
might
disagree
on
the
question
but
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
proper
to
say
that
it's
a
matter
of
law,
or
constitutional
law
if
such
a
conclusion
would
be
unreasonable.
and
i
think
that
if
we
bear
in
mind
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
matter
of
which
in
the
first
instance
must
be
found
to
be
obscene
and
in
new
york
must
be
found
to
be
hardcore
pornography.
and
therefore,
without
any
other
value
at
all
except
its
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
it
might
well
be
thought
that
anybody
who
purveys
or
shows
itself
is
necessarily
selling
it
for
the
purpose
or
with
a
specific
intent
to
ponder.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
the
difficulty
with
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it's
too
late
to
say
that
the
intent
can
be
inferred
from
the
nature
of
the
material.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
no,
no,
i
don't
think
i
made
my
point
clear.
i
said
that
if
the
book
is
found
to
be
obscene
by
the
court,
then
necessarily
it
is
without
any
value.
and
someone
selling
it
might
therefore
be
inferred
to
be
selling
it
for
the
purpose
of
appealing
since
that
is
by
definition
the
only
quality
which
the
work
has.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
(voice
overlap)
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
sir,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
difficulty
with
taking
a
specific
intent
standard
is
that
specific
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
well
i
would
--
in
this
particular
instance,
or
generally,
i
think
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
will
depend
on
the
quality
--
it
would
depend
upon
the
work.
that
is
to
say,
if
there
is
familiar
sale
of
the
work
which
is
clearly
on
its
face
observable
to
anybody
who
looks
at
it
is
obscenity.
then
you
would
say
the
person
who
sold
it
by
looking
at
it
would
know
that
it's
--
enough
about
its
factual
character.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
and
it
was
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
knew
what
was
in
it,
the
conviction
ought
not
to
be
the
same.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
there's
one
other
thing
and
that
goes
back
to
the
question
on
whether
you
can
tell
a
book
by
its
cover.
there
is
the
book
itself
and
there
is
the
picture
on
the
book.
there
is
the
blurb
on
the
front
cover.
there
is
the
description
on
the
back
from
which
even
without
the
conversation.
a
fact
finder
might
conclude
that
he
knew
enough
about
the
general
nature
of
the
book,
the
general
factual
character
of
the
book
to
be
chargeable
with
the
knowledge
of
its
contents
under
this
very
doctrine.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
it's
only
six
words
long.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
he's
not
required
to
justice
white.
under
the
--
under
smith
against
california,
if
it
is
there
in
front
of
him
and
there's
enough
about
it
objectively
to
put
him
on
notice
then
he
cannot
escape
liability
by
his
failure
to
investigate
further
and
that
is
why
i
understand
smith.
its
not
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
i
think
that
is
the
standard
under
smith.
i
think
quite
clearly
that
that's
the
standard
under
smith.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
new
york
law
does
adopt
smith
in
that
respect.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
smith
laid
down
the
standard
as
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
smith
did
not
lay
down
any
standard
as
to
what
he
had
to
know
but
smith
did
lay
down
the
proposition
that
a
man
who
is
not
familiar
with
every
written
word
in
the
shop,
nonetheless
does
not
escape
criminal
liability
if
there
were
works
which
he
should
have
investigated
further.
in
other
words,
he
cannot
chill
himself
by
negligent
failure
to
inquire
into
the
factual
nature
of
the
works
himself.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
or
the
book
seller,
no,
neither
one.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
right,
neither
one.
well,
this
was
specifically
discussed
in
smith
as
your
honor
recalls
and
it
was
stated
that
smith
said,
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
that
it
does
not
require
it.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
well
in
this
case
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
this
case,
if
you
have
to
--
if
knowledge
requires
knowledge
of
the
factual
contents
then
a
strongest
piece
of
evidence
is
the
defendant
himself
said,
this
is
not
as
bad
as
something
else.
and
if
he
had
sufficient
knowledge
of
its
character
to
make
a
comparison
between
the
working
question
and
another
work
then
he
had
sufficient
knowledge
for
the
purposes
of
constitutional
scienter.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
arguments
today
are
addressed
to
the
questions
which
was
specifically
left
open
by
this
court
in
smith
against
california
and
once
again
in
michigan
last
year.
given
that
any
obscenity
prosecution
in
the
state
court,
requires
proof
of
the
element
of
scienter.
the
question
was
left
open
in
smith,
what
sort
of
mental
element
is
required.
the
second
question
left
open
in
smith
was,
“does
an
honest
mistake
concerning
the
obscenity
of
the
work
excused
from
criminal
liability?”
now,
in
new
york
our
statute
has
been
mentioned.
it
does
not
specifically
refer
to
scienter
as
an
element.
but
following
this
court's
decision
in
smith,
our
high
court
in
finkelstein
construed
our
statute
as
implicitly
requiring
proof
of
that
element.
and
ever
since
we
have
in
new
york
prosecuted
as
though
the
statute
quite
explicitly
required
proof
of
knowledge.
the
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
that
i
think
is
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
this
court
in
michigan
quoted
the
operative
language
from
finkelstein
and
in
fact
underlined
the
two
phrases
in
that
sentence
from
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
there
said
that
our
statute
requires
awareness
of
the
character
of
the
work.
that
it
is
not
innocent
but
calculated
prevails
of
obscenity
which
is
proscribed.
unfortunately
in
this
entire
area,
these
words
have
been
very
loosely
used
and
surprisingly
never
defined.
the
term
character
is
frequently
used
interchangeably
with
context.
i
dare
say
that
there
are
some
jurisdictions
which
feel
that
the
word
character
means
the
legal
character
of
the
work
but
i
suggest
that
it's
just
a
susceptible
of
the
construction
of
factual
character.
that
is
to
say
the
category,
the
type
of
work,
based
upon
those
objectively
discernible
characteristics
or
particular
a
piece
of
material.
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
if
they
intended
to
say
knowledge
of
what?
did
so
in
an
extremely
imprecise
fashion
and
i
think
the
conviction
and
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
this
case
illustrates
that
the
courts
of
new
york
have
not
interpreted
to
think
of
the
case
as
requiring
knowledge
of
the
obscenity
of
the
work.
it
is
our
submission
here
that
neither
did
smith
--
scienter
as
a
mental
element
traditionally
refers
to
knowledge
of
operative
fact.
indeed,
it
is
the
circumstances
which
is
susceptible
of
knowledge
by
the
ordinary
layperson
or
to
which
the
criminal
law
is
applicable.
i
dare
say
that
obscenity
itself
is
such
a
difficult
concept,
legal
conclusion
that
there
are
many
experts
in
this
field
who
themselves
would
hesitate
to
express
a
firm
knowledge
that
a
particular
work
was
obscene
because
what
is
involved
there
is
really
a
prediction
of
the
outcome
of
litigation
are
all
the
way
up
to
this
court.
and
in
as
much
as
this
court
has
disagreed
on
particular
pieces
of
work
with
reference
to
their
obscenity,
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
require
knowledge
of
obscenity
from
a
lawyer
let
alone
from
layperson.
of
course,
i
have
seen
knowledge
defined
and
broken
down
in
the
best
spectrum
of
degrees
of
knowledge.
all
the
way
from
an
accurate
certainty
through
negligence
to
inquire
down
to
perhaps
a
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
converse.
but
i
suggest
that
although
these
distinctions
between
different
types
of
knowledge
are
perhaps
interesting
from
an
academic
sense
that
they
are
virtually
impossible
to
apply
at
any
sort
of
standard
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
that
was
left
open
in
smith
is
not
precisely
phrased
as
what
sort
of
knowledge
but
rather
knowledge
of
what.
if
it
were
to
be
construed
as
knowledge
of
obscenity.
we
would
not
have
reached
the
result.
i
think
this
court
would
not
have
reached
the
result
it
did
in
the
ginzburg
case.
for
--
in
the
advertisements
of
the
material
in
that
case
which
were
accepted
at
face
value
by
the
court.
it
was
quite
clear
that
while
ginzburg
was
advertising
his
work
as
salacious
that
he
was
making
no
bones
about
it
according
to
appeal.
i
think
at
the
same
time
he
was
evidencing
his
own
belief
that
the
material
was
constitutionally
protective
and
therefore
not
obscene
because
in
point
of
fact,
he
stated
as
you
--
as
the
court
of
calls
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
an
it's
decision
has
specifically
allowed
the
distribution
of
that
sort
of
material.
consequentially,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
in
reaching
that
decision
was
implicitly
recognizing
the
fact
that
the
scienter
could
not
be
the
subjective
belief
in
obscenity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
to
honest
mistake,
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
the
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
am
--
i'm
very
tempted
to
agree
and
say
that
the
honest
mistake
was
specifically
rejected
by
that
holding
but
i
hesitate
only
on
the
grounds
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
an
honest
mistake
is.
the
extent
which
good
faith
figures
in
the
concept.
i
do
think
however
that
honest
mistake
as
to
obscenity
is
really
just
the
other
way
around
to
the
same
question
of
requiring
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
suppose
if
it's
not
honest
it's
not
a
mistake
and
if
there
is
an
honest
mistake
as
to
obscenity
which
excuses
then
you're
merely
stating
the
adverse
of
the
proposition
which
must
prove
that
the
person
knew
or
was
aware
of
the
obscene
quality
of
the
work.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
sense
the
second
question
of
smith
really
is
just
another
aspect
of
the
first.
this
court
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
in
an
analogous
first
amendment
case
referred
to
the
smith
question.
and
stated
that
what
was
required
by
smith
was
guilty
knowledge.
again,
following
this
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
garrison
against
louisiana
that
guilty
knowledge
was
construed
to
mean
a
high
degree
of
awareness
of
the
probable
falsehood
of
the
statement.
well
once
again,
they
would
seem
to
me
that
the
knowledge
of
falsehood
would
be
called
a
factual
sort
of
determination
and
not
a
prediction
of
the
legal
conclusion
and
therefore
this
own
court's
reference
to
the
smith
knowledge
is
factual.
indeed
despite
the
fact
that
the
sort
of
knowledge
was
left
as
an
open
question
there
in
the
body
of
the
smith
decision
itself
contents
are
referred
to.
another
analogous
area
of
course
is
the
area
of
subversion
and
thereto
this
court
has
looked
to
the
question
of
scienter.
and
has
required
not
only
knowledge
by
an
individual
adjoining
a
subversive
organization
of
its
purposes
but
a
shared
intent
in
those
unlawful
purposes
but
again,
this
was
a
factual
sort
of
scienter.
it
was
not
knowledge
that
if
he
engaged
in
this
conduct,
he
would
be
violating
the
law
that
it
would
be
subversion
but
only
the
espousal
of
the
purposes,
a
factual
determination.
the
petitioner
in
a
footnote
purports
to
recite
--
does
no
more
in
states
which
have
in
their
laws
construed
the
scienter
requirement
as
knowledge
of
obscenity.
however,
a
reference
to
those
cases
and
to
other
cases
and
those
jurisdictions
reveals
that
unfortunately
this
is
a
term
which
in
application
loses
its
significance.
in
california
for
example
which
one
of
the
jurisdictions
mentioned
by
the
petitioner.
there
is
a
case
which
part
explicitly
states
that
the
knowledge
of
obscenity
is
a
knowledge
of
contents
only
and
not
a
knowledge
of
legal
result.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
is
the
process
that
those
jurisdictions
would
follow.
and
i
think
that
it's
not
necessary
to
do
so.
as
you
pointed
out
the
facts
of
this
case
is
susceptible
of
our
conclusion
that
he
knew
the
facts
but
did
not
know
obscenity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
that
sense,
exactly,
and
the
same
with
ginzburg.
however,
those
states
which
have
attempted
to
apply
a
legal
standard
have
come
back
to
a
factual
standard
and
actual
operations.
and
i
think
necessarily
so.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
would
be
a
reasonable
doubt
i
think
if
his
knowledge
of
the
obscenity
even
if
the
court
were
unanimous
that
the
work
was
obscene.
if
the
standard
were
to
be
his
own
legal
appraisal
of
the
facts
that
he
knew
them.
and
that
is
to
say
a
defendant
were
presumably
in
good
faith
with
the
standards
being
as
flexible
as
they
necessarily
are
in
this
feel
that
something
was
not
obscene
where
any
court
in
the
land
would
disagree
with
it.
and
according
to
the
standard
which
is
here
proposed
he
could
acquit
himself
by
his
own
belief
an
his
innocence.
and
our
submission
to
this
court
that
this
proposition
is
normally
in
the
criminal
law,
a
man
cannot
be
his
own
judge.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
with
this
proposition
is
universally
accepted
i
think
that
the
only
question
is
what
is
a
good
faith
expression.
i
think
that
anything
which
is
deemed
a
good
faith
expression
is
certainly
protected.
if
the
material
in
this
case
comes
within
that
category
i
don't
think
that
we
need
even
reach
the
question
of
scienter
because
he
would
go
out
on
the
question
of
obscenity
as
defined
by
roth.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
absolutely.
his
belief
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
his
belief
could
not
convict
him.
if
he
had
a
manifested
bad
belief
by
advertising
the
work
and
such
then
presumably
that
conduct
on
his
part
would
have
some
effect
on
the
nature
of
the
material
itself
under
the
ginzburg
doctrine.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
it
is
not
out
there.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct,
justice
harlan.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
our
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
but
our
submission
is
that
the
--
whether
he
believed
they
were
obscene
or
believed
that
they
were
not
obscene
is
a
totally
irrelevant
consideration
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
that
the
questions
are
merely
two.
were
the
books
in
fact
obscene
and
did
he
have
some
awareness
of
the
facts
about
these
books
which
in
the
case
of
obscenity
is
something
which
is
objectively
perceivable?
you
have
a
written
material,
you
have
photographs,
you
have
a
physical
object
about
which
something
can
be
learned
even
by
a
layman.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
did
not
deny.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
said
he
didn't
recall
one
way
or
another.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
have
been
thinking
very
much
along
the
same
lines
myself
it's
a
novel
idea
in
the
field.
i
think
that
a
distinction
would
have
to
be
made
quite
sharply
between
knowledge
and
intent.
unfortunately
the
distinction
which
is
rarely
made
but
it
should
be
in
the
criminal
law,
i
think
that
as
to
knowledge
the
mental
element
of
knowledge
one
could
be
quite
content
with
a
factual
knowledge
as
to
mens
rea
or
intent.
what
we
would
be
doing
in
effect
is
converting
this
crime
into
a
crime
of
specific
intent.
the
problem
of
intent
as
the
commentators
have
noticed
in
field
very
frequently
is
the
type
of
intent
whether
it
would
be
general
or
specifically
it's
not
very
clearly
spelled
out
and
i
would
say
that
in
new
york
this
usually
thought
to
the
legislation
to
say
at
least
the
local
state
courts.
but
in
new
york
we
have
not
deem
this
to
be
a
crime
of
specific
intent.
however,
consistently
with
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
ginzburg
and
related
cases
i
can
easily
see
how
it
might
become
a
constitutionally
necessary
element
in
the
crime
to
prove
that
the
material
was
distributed
with
the
intent
to
appeal
the
prurient
interest
which
is
a
specific
intent
rather
than
a
general
mens
rea
sort
of
intent.
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
element
that
would
probably
be
imperceptible
of
proof.
your
honor,
mentioned
the
number
of
elements
in
this
particular
factual
situation
that
do
relate
to
it
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
think
back
to
the
ginzburg
and
michigan
to
see
the
contrary
so
with
the
facts.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i'm
relying
on
the
court's
decision
in
the
ginzburg
case.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
exactly.
well,
certainly
it
does
and
i
--
perhaps
answered
that
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that's
the
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
is
some
history
of
that
usually
a
minority
of
the
court,
chief
justices
written
long
before
ginzburg
along
that
line.
but
i
would
have
answered
somewhat
differently
a
greater
length
of
question
of
what
this
has
to
do
with
the
constitution,
mr.
stewart
in
this
fashion.
the
theory
of
smith
was
that
because
of
certain
inherent
and
necessary
vagueness
in
the
concept
of
obscenity
and
because
these
ambiguities
unfortunately
have
a
tendency
to
promote
self-censorship.
in
violation
of
the
spirit
of
the
first
amendment
it
is
necessary
to
so
far
delimit
the
area
of
prosecution
as
to
minimize
the
hazard
of
self-censorship.
and
that
the
first
amendment
requires
us
without
such
measures
as
will
minimize
the
hazard
of
self-censorship.
that
i
think
is
the
way
the
intent
factor
or
the
knowledge
factor
comes
into
the
field.
i
do
think
that
however
that
if
it's
elusory
to
believe
that
by
requiring
proof
to
come
back
to
knowledge
for
a
moment,
proof
of
knowledge
of
obscenity
as
a
means
for
minimizing
the
hazards
of
self-censorship,
we're
diluting
ourselves.
it
has
a
superficial
appeal.
if
you
think
of
the
very
hardest
core
pornography
they
very
rarely
any
doubt
that
anyone
who
sees
that
must
know
at
once
not
only
it's
facts
or
factual
character
of
it
but
also
that
it
is
obscene
in
proscribed
by
law.
consequently,
in
eliminating
prosecution
to
the
hardest
of
the
hard
called
pornography
but
which
perhaps
is
a
worthwhile
end
indeed
in
new
york,
our
law
has
been
construed
as
being
limited
to
prosecution
of
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
precisely
my
next
point.
unfortunately,
this
superficial
appeal
evaporates
when
you
see
in
the
way
in
which
it's
applied
because
just
as
to
one
person,
something
it's
unequivocally
hardcore
pornography
and
anyone
looking
at
it
should
have
known
that
it
was
obscene.
so
to
another
judge
to
another
court
are
something,
are
considerably
further
along
toward
the
border
is
just
as
unequivocally
pornographic
and
should
have
been
perceived
as
such.
consequently,
i
think
that
it's
elusory
to
think
that
we
can
limit
and
then
--
we
were
back
to
the
same
problem
of
the
definition
of
obscenity
and
the
fact
that
courts
differ
on
obscenity.
i
think
the
border
disputes
will
be
with
us
as
long
as
obscenity
is
an
exception
to
the
first
amendment.
i
do
think
however
that
it
may
be
constitutionally
preferable
to
look
at
it
in
terms
of
intent
now
that
we
have
the
ginzburg
decision
rather
than
in
terms
of
knowledge.
i
think
it
would
be
an
outrage
to
the
theory
of
the
criminal
law
to
require
that
anyone
prosecuted
for
a
crime
to
be
guilty
must
believe
in
his
own
guilt.
i
think
it
would
be
circular
to
define
pornography
as
that
which
anybody
looking
at
it
would
know
what's
pornography.
obviously,
the
circularity
of
that
definition
is
out.
consequently,
i
don't
think
that
the
constitutional
purpose
of
limiting
the
hazards
of
self-censorship
is
served
as
adequately
by
redefinition
of
the
traditional
concept
of
scienter
as
it
would
be
by
pursuit
of
justice
fortas'
suggestion
that
we
look
at
it
in
terms
of
scienter.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
terms
of
specific
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
specific
intent,
that's
right.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
for
me
to
argue
that
in
this
case
the
clerk
in
the
store
specifically
intended
to
appeal
the
prurient
interests.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
certainly
don't
think
that
that
fact
would
be
the
only
factor.
i
--
specific
intent
in
any
case
is
of
course
inferable
from
operative
facts
also.
again
in
the
sense,
you're
getting
back
to
a
factual
question.
if
this
police
officer
had
gone
up
to
a
$75.00
a
week
clerk
and
express
his
desire
for
reading
material
in
a
manner
other
than
by
just
naming
a
title
of
the
book
that
was
on
display,
asking
for
the
book
by
title.
expressing
his
desire
for
certain
type
of
book
or
movie
and
the
clerk
had
supplied
the
book
in
response
to
that
desire
i
think
it
might
be
reasonable
for
a
fact
finder
to
infer
the
intent
of
the
seller
was
to
ponder,
was
to
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
particular
customer.
it's
a
novel
theory,
justice
stewart
and
it's
extremely
difficult
to
try
and
visit
the
facts
that
might
fit
within
it.
if
i
were
to
be
completely
candid
i
would
probably
say
that
the
courts
in
applying
such
a
new
standard
would
pretty
much
come
around
to
the
same
results
that
they
have
now.
because
once
again,
it
would
be
felt
that
any
person
who
sold
or
distributed
or
displayed
the
material
which
the
court
feels
is
obscene
would
be
doing
so
with
the
intent
to
ponder
because
for
what
other
purpose
could
somebody
be
selling
something
that
is
obscene.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
–
the
people
against
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
yes,
it
--
i
don't
know
that
this
court
could
say
that
it's
unreasonable
for
a
fact
finder
to
infer
from
the
nature
of
the
book
that
was
sold.
that
the
sale
was
made
with
the
intent
to
ponder.
i
can
see
how
fact
finders
might
disagree
on
the
question
but
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
proper
to
say
that
it's
a
matter
of
law,
or
constitutional
law
if
such
a
conclusion
would
be
unreasonable.
and
i
think
that
if
we
bear
in
mind
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
matter
of
which
in
the
first
instance
must
be
found
to
be
obscene
and
in
new
york
must
be
found
to
be
hardcore
pornography.
and
therefore,
without
any
other
value
at
all
except
its
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
it
might
well
be
thought
that
anybody
who
purveys
or
shows
itself
is
necessarily
selling
it
for
the
purpose
or
with
a
specific
intent
to
ponder.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
the
difficulty
with
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it's
too
late
to
say
that
the
intent
can
be
inferred
from
the
nature
of
the
material.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
no,
no,
i
don't
think
i
made
my
point
clear.
i
said
that
if
the
book
is
found
to
be
obscene
by
the
court,
then
necessarily
it
is
without
any
value.
and
someone
selling
it
might
therefore
be
inferred
to
be
selling
it
for
the
purpose
of
appealing
since
that
is
by
definition
the
only
quality
which
the
work
has.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
(voice
overlap)
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
sir,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
difficulty
with
taking
a
specific
intent
standard
is
that
specific
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
well
i
would
--
in
this
particular
instance,
or
generally,
i
think
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
will
depend
on
the
quality
--
it
would
depend
upon
the
work.
that
is
to
say,
if
there
is
familiar
sale
of
the
work
which
is
clearly
on
its
face
observable
to
anybody
who
looks
at
it
is
obscenity.
then
you
would
say
the
person
who
sold
it
by
looking
at
it
would
know
that
it's
--
enough
about
its
factual
character.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
and
it
was
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
knew
what
was
in
it,
the
conviction
ought
not
to
be
the
same.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
there's
one
other
thing
and
that
goes
back
to
the
question
on
whether
you
can
tell
a
book
by
its
cover.
there
is
the
book
itself
and
there
is
the
picture
on
the
book.
there
is
the
blurb
on
the
front
cover.
there
is
the
description
on
the
back
from
which
even
without
the
conversation.
a
fact
finder
might
conclude
that
he
knew
enough
about
the
general
nature
of
the
book,
the
general
factual
character
of
the
book
to
be
chargeable
with
the
knowledge
of
its
contents
under
this
very
doctrine.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
it's
only
six
words
long.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
he's
not
required
to
justice
white.
under
the
--
under
smith
against
california,
if
it
is
there
in
front
of
him
and
there's
enough
about
it
objectively
to
put
him
on
notice
then
he
cannot
escape
liability
by
his
failure
to
investigate
further
and
that
is
why
i
understand
smith.
its
not
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
i
think
that
is
the
standard
under
smith.
i
think
quite
clearly
that
that's
the
standard
under
smith.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
new
york
law
does
adopt
smith
in
that
respect.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
smith
laid
down
the
standard
as
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
smith
did
not
lay
down
any
standard
as
to
what
he
had
to
know
but
smith
did
lay
down
the
proposition
that
a
man
who
is
not
familiar
with
every
written
word
in
the
shop,
nonetheless
does
not
escape
criminal
liability
if
there
were
works
which
he
should
have
investigated
further.
in
other
words,
he
cannot
chill
himself
by
negligent
failure
to
inquire
into
the
factual
nature
of
the
works
himself.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
or
the
book
seller,
no,
neither
one.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
right,
neither
one.
well,
this
was
specifically
discussed
in
smith
as
your
honor
recalls
and
it
was
stated
that
smith
said,
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
that
it
does
not
require
it.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
well
in
this
case
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
in
this
case,
if
you
have
to
--
if
knowledge
requires
knowledge
of
the
factual
contents
then
a
strongest
piece
of
evidence
is
the
defendant
himself
said,
this
is
not
as
bad
as
something
else.
and
if
he
had
sufficient
knowledge
of
its
character
to
make
a
comparison
between
the
working
question
and
another
work
then
he
had
sufficient
knowledge
for
the
purposes
of
constitutional
scienter.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
correct.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
correct.
thank
you.
