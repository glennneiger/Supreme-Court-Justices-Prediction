mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
almost
three
years
to
the
date,
a
private
citizen,
a
mrs.
catherine
wolfen,
walked
into
the
read
more
bookstore
in
paducah,
kentucky
and
ordered
three
books,
two
magazines
rather.
she
ordered
four
and
she
purchased
two
magazines
the
required
title.
she
then
marched
over
to
the
mccracken
county
court
house
and
swore
out
a
complaint
in
statutory
language.
he
said
that
mr.
austin,
the
owner
of
the
store,
had
violated
the
kentucky
obscenity
law.
the
basis
of
her
charge
was
that
purchase
by
her
and
her
reading
of
the
magazines
in
her
conclusion
based
on
no
judicial
standards
that
the
magazines
were
in
fact
obscene.
the
statute
involved
provides
that
any
person
who
sells
an
obscene
book
or
magazine,
knowing
the
contents
or
character
is
guilty
of
an
offense.
the
statute
also
provides
that
any
person
who
sells
a
publication
found
by
the
jury
to
be
obscene
is
presumed
to
know
the
obscene
character
of
the
work.
now
the
evidence
against
mr.
austin
is
very
simple.
mr.
austin
stipulated
that
he
was
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
bookstore.
mrs.
wolfen
testified
that
she
had
called
up
a
friend
of
hers
and
said,
“i'm
going
to
make
a
buy
at
read
more
come
on
down
and
be
witness.”
and
she
made
a
buy.
she
stated
that
the
magazines
were
in
a
rack
behind
the
cash
register
and
she's
testified
that
they
were
in
this
rack
behind
the
cash
register
because
a
ministerial
association
had
asked
mr.
austin
to
take
them
out
of
reach
of
minors.
and
so,
mr.
austin
to
accommodate
himself
to
this
request
took
them
and
put
them
behind
the
cash
register,
where
only
a
person
who
ordered
the
magazines
by
title
could
get
them
and
where
no
minors
could
get.
the
only
other
evidence
in
the
case
is
the
testimony
of
reverend
simpson,
a
member
of
the
citizens
for
decent
literature
and
the
head
of
the
moral
and
social
welfare
committee
of
the
paducah
ministerial
association.
he
testified
that
he
had
asked
mr.
austin
to
come
down
to
a
meeting
that
the
ministers
had
to
discuss
objectionable
material.
at
that
time
mr.
austin
told
the
ministers,
that
if
they
had
any
specific
publications
they
thought
were
obscene
to
tell
him
and
he
would
remove
them.
and
the
ministers
in
effect
said,
“get
rid
of
all
of
them.”
that's
the
sum
in
substance
of
what
they
say.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
get
them
--
get
rid
of
all.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
magazines
are
contained
any
nudes
at
least.
that
was
the
short
of
it
and
that's
what
the
state
recognized
in
their
argument,
if
your
honor
please.
in
their
final
argument
to
the
jury,
they
pointed
out
that
in
effect
the
ministers
told
them
to
get
rid
of
playboy
now
and
forever.
not
just
playboy
may
but
playboy
so
that
there
won't
be
any
doubt
about
it
and
the
language
is
clear.
this
is
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor
to
the
jury.
they're
talking
about
mrs.wolfen
as
the
censor.
i'm
talking
on
page
86
of
the
record.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
hold
mrs.
catherine
wolfen
out
as
the
censor
of
mccracken
county.
she
is
not.
neither
of
the
ministers
the
censors
of
the
mccracken
county
and
they
have
got
no
obligation
to
any
person
to
go
out
and
censor
the
material
as
on
the
stands
in
paducah.
they
recognized
that
fact.
that's
a
dangerous
situation
but
what
did
they
do?
they
had
a
meeting,
two
meetings,
as
i
recall
the
testimony.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
with
the
prosecutor.
yes,
your
honor.
the
last
one
in
may
of
1963,
and
the
objection
on
the
part
of
the
ministers
was
all
of
the
material
that
he
called
adult
reading.
they
objected
to
it,
all
of
it.
there
weren't
going
to
specify
this
issue,
that
issue
or
some
other
issue.
they
told
him
that
they
objected
to
all
of
it
if
they
should,
why
if
they
have
told
him
they
object
to
the
may
issue
of
playboy
magazine.
all
they
would
have
to
do
is
put
on
the
june.
that's
what
we
have.
this
is
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
evidence
upon
which
petitioner
was
convicted.
now
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner
sought
to
show
that
he
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
magazines
were
not
obscene.
he
tried
to
show
it
in
a
variety
of
ways.
first,
he
tried
to
show
that
he
tried
to
limit
himself
only
to
those
magazines
which
had
second
class
mailing
privileges
from
the
post
office
department.
a
magazine
that
has
second
class
mailing
privileges
is
presumed
to
be
not
obscene
because
the
post
office
department
has
no
right
to
issue
second
class
mailing
privileges
to
obscene
publications.
he
tried
to
show
that
he
couldn't
possibly
read
the
11
or
12,000
magazines
that
were
in
his
store
at
all
times.
he
tried
to
show
that
for
years
he
had
been
distributing
exactly
the
same
type
of
magazine
over
a
four-state
area,
tennessee,
kentucky,
missouri
and
illinois.
he
tried
to
show
that
this
court
had
found
nudist
magazines
far
more
revealing
than
the
two
magazines
involved.
but
this
court
have
them
to
be
not
obscene
and
he
tried
to
show
that
in
the
paducah
library,
there
were
books
containing
portrayals
of
nudes
which
were
in
every
respect
as
frank
and
as
candid
as
those
in
the
magazines
involved
here.
all
of
these
were
totally
excluded
by
the
trial
court
and
consistent
with
the
rulings
or
with
these
rulings
of
the
trial
court.
the
judge
refused
to
give
an
instruction
requested
by
the
petitioner
that
if
the
jury
found
that
he
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
magazines
were
not
obscene,
the
jury
should
acquit.
it's
indicated
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
and
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
grant
a
motion
to
appeal
with
the
chief
justice
dissenting.
so
the
first
question
we
have
here
is
the
one
left
open
in
smith
against
california
is
a
good
faith
belief
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
the
books
he
handles
himself
are
not
obscene,
a
defense
to
a
obscenity
prosecution.
now,
we
touch
--
it
was
touch
upon
in
the
last
page
but
it
does
repetition,
that
there
are
two
important
considerations
involved
in
the
smith
rule.
the
first
one
is
that
obscenity
is
defined
by
this
court
is
extraordinarily
vague.
and
if
a
bookseller
faced
with
a
very
vague
law
can
be
held
criminally
liable
when
he
believes
that
the
publication
is
in
all
respect
lawful.
he
either
goes
out
of
the
business
or
he
goes
into
a
business
where
the
risk
is
higher
than
in
any
other
lawful
business.
and
we're
talking
about
bookstores
where
ordinarily
we
want
to
give
maximum
and
not
minimum
protection.
the
other
alternative
to
going
out
of
the
business
is
to
handle
only
cook
books
and
even
those
aren't
so
safe
because
there
are
so
aphrodisiac
books
on
eating.
now,
the
respondent
here
advances
three
reasons
for
denying
to
the
petitioner
the
right
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
he
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
magazines
in
questions
were
not
obscene
and
in
justifying
the
trial
court's
refusal
to
grant
the
requested
instruction.
first
of
all,
the
respondent
says
that
the
evidence
against
petitioner
is
so
conclusive,
so
overwhelming
that
nobody
knowing
the
facts
that
petitioner
knew
could
have
--
could
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
they
were
not
obscene.
now
what
is
this
overwhelming
evidence?
the
overwhelming
evidence
is
that
the
petitioner
may
have
no
one
that
he
had
in
his
store
magazines
which
contain
portrayals
of
nudes,
that's
all
and
this
in
the
face
of
untold
holdings
by
this
court
and
other
courts
that
nudity
is
not
synonymous
with
obscenity.
the
second
reason
given
by
the
respondent
is
that
petitioner
couldn't
ask
and
expect
to
get
the
instruction
on
good
faith
belief
because
he
said,
he
never
read
the
books,
the
magazines
in
the
first
instance
and
so,
the
respondent
argues.
how
can
he
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
magazines
are
not
obscene
without
looking
at
them?
respondent
argues
that
before
a
petitioner,
before
a
bookseller
may
claim
the
right
to
a
good
--
to
the
defense
of
good
faith
belief
that
the
material
is
not
obscene.
he
will
have
to
take
the
stand
and
in
effect
incriminate
himself.
that
is
to
say
the
prosecutor
wants
him
to
get
him
on
the
stand
and
say,
“i
read
the
book
so
magazines.”
and
then
from
that
they'll
say
uh-huh,
he
read
the
books
and
magazines
and
that's
proof
enough.
and
then
the
prosecutor
respondent
finally
says
that
the
instruction
shouldn't
have
been
given
because
of
rosen
against
united
states.
and
that
rosen
against
united
states
indeed
means
that
the
good
faith
belief
on
the
part
of
the
bookseller
that
the
material
he
sells
is
not
obscene
is
irrelevant.
with
all
due
respect,
we
suggest
that
the
rosen
case
should
not
be
controlling
here.
first
of
all,
rosen
was
decided,
it's
almost
70
years
now,
at
that
time
when
there
were
no
first
amendment
considerations
involved
or
implicated.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
was
a
federal
case,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
none
were
raised
and
none
were
discussed.
the
entire
case
was
treated
as
if
the
first
amendment
had
no
application.
i
think
it
might
have
been
argued
and
discussed
in
a
different
fashion
but
as
it
was
handled.
it
was
no
first
amendment
considerations
were
brought
to
play
nor
considered
in
the
case.
secondly,
rosen
of
course
was
decided
the
time
when
hicklin
controls.
now,
a
determination
of
obscenity
under
hicklin
is
quite
different
from
a
determination
of
obscenity
under
roth,
alberts
as
expanded
by
the
various
cases
of
this
court.
under
hicklin
everything
was
intuitive.
there
were
no
outside
considerations
if
person
look
at
something
that
he
didn't
like
it
or
he
thought
it
might
offend
the
most
susceptible
person
that
was
it.
and
the
fact
is
that
at
the
present
time
it
is
simply
irrational
to
assume
or
as
previously
been
discussed
that
a
person
who
reads
the
book
or
reads
the
magazine
knows
merely
from
the
reading
that
the
publication
offends
the
obscenity
law.
that
is
to
say
that
from
reading
it
one
would
know
that
it
goes
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor,
appeals
to
prurient
interest,
and
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
earlier,
if
members
of
this
court
have
good
faith
and
honest
disagreement
among
their
selves
with
regard
to
whether
a
particular
book
is
or
is
not
obscene.
surely
that
in
itself
proves
that
there
is
room
at
least
for
honest
difference
of
opinion
with
regard
to
persons
who
look
at
the
material
and
reach
contrary
completions.
as
indicated,
the
kentucky
revised
statutes
provides
in
43600
subdivision
4
that
the
sale
of
a
publication
found
by
a
jury
to
be
obscene
is
presumed
to
that
the
seller
is
presumed
to
know
that
it
was
obscene.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
statute?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thats
the
mere
sale,
the
mere
sale
without
knowing
the
contents
of
the
publication
that
is
to
say
in
this
case,
merely
because
the
two
magazines
were
sold
that
brought
the
presumption
into
being
and
under
the
statute.
he
was
presumed
to
know
of
the
obscene
character
of
the
work.
now
in
the
face
of
this
presumption,
the
petitioner
sought
to
adduce
evidence
to
negate
it.
he
certainly
was
putting
on
evidence
which
was
relevant
to
his
good
faith.
it
is,
justice
harlan,
indicated
in
the
smith
case,
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
put
on
evidence
showing
that
a
work
doesn't
go
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor
on
the
issue
of
obscenity.
then
he
has
a
light
right,
we
respectfully
submit
to
put
on
evidence
to
show
that
the
hidden
belief
the
material
is
obscene
which
is
what
he
sought
to
do
in
all
of
which
was
totally
excluded
so
that
on
that
constitutional
issue
of
scienter.
there
was
a
totally
exclusion
of
evidence.
i
should
point
out
as
we
have
in
our
reply
brief
that
after
the
case
here
and
effective
june
of
this
year,
kentucky
repealed
the
statute
and
amended
and
enacted
a
new
law
and
specifically
found
or
in
these
new
statutes,
specifically
sets
the
standard
as
knowledge
of
obscenity.
that
is
to
say
under
the
law
in
kentucky
as
it
is
exists
today,
a
person
who
sells
a
publication
found
to
be
obscene
must
--
the
prosecution
must
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
he
had
knowledge
that
the
work
was
obscene
and
the
statute
as
it
now
exists
has
eliminated
the
presumption
which
was
working
against
the
petitioner
in
the
case
at
the
time
that
he
went
to
trial
and
at
the
time
that
he
was
convicted.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
excluded
evidence
was
offered
on
both
issues
because
for
the
most
thought
it
bore
on
both
the
issue
of
whether
the
publications
were
obscene
and
also
bore
on
whether
he
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
it
was
not
obscene.
there
was
some
evidence
however
which
would
have
been
directed
solely
at
his
good
faith
belief
that
it
was
not
obscene.
that
was
the
evidence
where
he
sought
to
show
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
examined
the
11,000
or
12,000
publications
that
he
had
in
his
bookstore
at
all
time.
that
was
excluded
and
i
assume
that
was
directed
solely
to
the
question
of
scienter.
but
the
other
evidence,
the
broad
sale
of
playboy
magazine,
rouge
magazine,
and
others
which
the
petitioner
said
were
all
about
the
same
as
the
two
magazines
involved
his
evidence
with
regard
to
the
second
class
mailing
privileges
enjoyed
by
these
magazines
would
have
gone
to
both
of
the
issues.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
he
received
a
sentence
of
$250.00.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
was
no
jail
sentence
in
this
case,
your
honor.
now,
there
is
--
i
think
a
consideration
here
that
your
honors
ought
to
give
weight
to.
in
the
case
of
bantam
books
against
sullivan,
this
court
was
very
anxious
to
see
that
a
bookseller
or
a
distributor
not
suppressed
books
when
those
who
were
operating
were
doing
so
outside
of
a
judicial
framework
and
not
consistent
with
--
not
consistent
with
legal
standards.
and
so
it
was
that
the
rhode
island
commission
on
morality
which
was
sending
out
notices
not
to
distribute
this
or
not
to
distribute
that
was
found
to
be
offending
the
constitution
and
the
effect
of
these
notices
was
seen
and
recognized
in
the
court
when
the
distributor
in
rhode
island
sees
distributing
each
and
every
one
of
the
books
and
magazines
and
there
were
106
of
them
which
the
rhode
island
commission
condemned.
this
court
was
pointed
out
that
in
this
fashion
--
in
this
fashion
much
material
which
was
constitutionally
protected
was
being
suppressed.
now
turning
to
this
case
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
austin
was
faced
with
a
problem.
there
was
a
psychological
warfare
going
on
paducah,
kentucky
three
years
ago.
mrs.
wolfen
was
coming
down
to
the
bookstore
and
making
purchases
regularly,
twice
before
this
faithful
day.
she
had
made
other
purchases
of
magazines,
twice.
mr.
austin
was
called
before
this
ministerial
association.
now
he
had
a
choice
to
make.
he
either
could
say,
i
vow
and
i
take
everything
out
of
my
newsstand
or
he
should
say,
as
i
understood
this
court
was
encouraging
distributors
to
say
in
the
bantam
books
case,
there
shouldn't
be
suppression
of
material
which
is
not
obscene.
he
made
his
judgment
that
these
magazines
were
not
obscene
in
law.
he
tried
as
a
businessman
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
pressures
that
were
put.
but
if
he
has
denied
the
protection
of
the
law
under
this
circumstance
and
he
can
be
branded
a
criminal
because
he
didn't
vow
totally
to
the
pressures
that
were
put,
then
we
will
have
more
suppression,
far
more
suppression
than
was
have
put
bantam
books
against
sullivan.
and
i
will
say
that
if
mr.
austin
is
a
criminal
for
having
had
sold
and
he
didn't
do
the
selling,
it
was
his
clerk.
if
he
is
a
criminal
because
they
were
sold
in
his
bookstore,
these
two
magazines
which
are
no
different
from
any
number
of
magazines
which
are
circulating
throughout
the
country
today
and
continuously,
then
every
bookseller
and
every
wholesaler
in
the
united
states
of
america
is
today
a
criminal.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
law
can
be
such
that
we
either
disregard
all
this
criminality
or
that
we
end
up
with
the
kind
of
suppression
that
is
inherent
in
this
conviction.
the
only
way,
we
respectfully
submit,
that
the
bookseller
can
have
any
confidence
in
carrying
out
his
business
in
a
lawful
way
is
to
receive
the
kind
of
legal
protection
that
was
promised
in
smith
and
the
promised
has
not
been
fulfilled.
at
least
in
smith,
the
thought
was
apart
in
around
that
a
bookseller
who
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
what
he
was
doing
was
lawful
could
not
be
made
a
criminal.
we
are
aware
of
course
of
the
problems
that
are
always
pointed
to
in
terms
of,
if
the
prosecution
must
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
work
was
obscene
that
there
would
not
be
many
convictions.
nor
should
that
be.
the
number
of
convictions
that
are
coming
out
in
the
united
states
of
america
today
for
selling
books
is
astounding.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
have
not
collected
them.
i
have
received
however
a
report
from
the
citizens
for
decent
literature
that
it
seems
to
have
collected
them
and
they
run
into
the
many
hundreds,
many
hundreds
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
annually.
yes.
its
fright
--
it's
really
frightening
what
is
going
on
with
regard
to
these
new
standards
that
have
been
coming
out
in
this
field
of
obscenity.
but
the
problem
is
not
really
even
to
have
to
tolerate
material
with
society
has
a
legitimate
right
to
suppress.
there
are
other
weapons
available.
we
are
familiar
with
the
fact
that
there
are
in
rem
proceedings
where
material
which
is
thought
to
be
obscene
can
be
suppress
without
criminalizing
an
innocent
man
for
selling
it.
and
while
this
is
a
great
evil
to
have
this
kind
of
prior
restraint
as
mr.
justice
black
indicated
in
the
ginzburg
case,
it's
less
of
an
evil
than
sending
man
to
jail
for
25
years
or
10
years
or
5
years.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
under
the
limited
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
under
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
it's
obscene,
although,
i'll
tell
you
quite
frankly
that
they
are
not
obscene
the
magazines.
they
are
simply
are
not
but
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
has
a
bearing
of
course,
i
believe
that
there
are
some
materials
which
would
be
so
very
powerful
that
he
denied
by
a
person
who
read
it
that
he
thought
it
was
not
obscene
would
not
be
given
great
way.
on
the
contrary,
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
you
take
a
playboy
magazine
and
if
he
says,
i
really
think
playboy
is
not
obscene.
i've
been
fine
to
think
that
we'd
all
agree
with
him
at
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
in
this
case,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
there
are
answers
sufficient
in
our
case
but
in
any
case
surely
to
go
the
scienter.
you
have
to
know
what's
involved.
i
think
our
case
because
we
really
raise
questions
of
instructions
for
the
most
part.
we're
in
a
position
to
get
a
ruling
to
here
because
what
if
we
have
ask
for
an
instruction
of
the
court
saying
that,
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
it
was
not
was
obscene
then
acquit.
we
believe
we're
entitled
to
that
instruction
in
any
case
no
matter
how
rough
the
material
may
be,
the
defendant
should
always
have
that
instruction.
the
jury
may
not
think
much
of
his
defense
but
he
ought
to
be
--
have
that
defense
available
to
him.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
time,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
to
matter
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
that
was
whether
or
not
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury
that
they
must
find
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
knew
the
contents
and
the
character
of
the
material
was
such
that
the
jury
knew
that
they
had
to
find,
as
the
state
conceived
they
had
to
affirm
that
he
knew
the
material
was
in
fact
obscene.
the
plain
answer
is,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
jury
could
not
have
so
understood
it.
and
i
call
attention
to
page
23
of
the
record
and
there,
the
witness
was
reverend
simpson.
he
was
asked
about
two
magazines
not
the
two
magazines
involved
in
this
case
but
two
other
girlie
magazines
that
were
shown
to
mr.
austin
at
the
time
of
his
meeting
with
the
ministerial
association.
objection
was
made
to
the
showing
of
these
other
magazines
on
the
ground
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
and
the
court,
that
i
will
let
the
jury
consider
it
for
the
purpose
of
whether
or
not
he
had
knowledge
of
the
class
or
character.
it's
plain,
therefore,
that
what
was
meant
by
"character"
was,
that
mr.
austin
knew
that
he
had
girlie
magazines
and
only
that.
not
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
two
specific
magazines
involved
and
surely
not
that
he
knew
that
the
two
specific
magazines
involved
were
in
fact
obscene.
now,
in
light
of
the
concession
by
the
respondent
that
the
state
did
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
defendant
knew
the
material
wasn't
in
fact
obscene,
in
light
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
instruction
given
where
it
was
never
stated
to
the
jury
that
they
had
to
find
that
he
knew
the
magazine
was
obscene,
then
surely
the
defendant
requested
instruction
that
he
should
be
found
not
guilty.
if
the
jury
found
that
he
in
good
faith
believe
that
to
be
not
obscene,
should
have
been
given.
and
we
submit
that
such
an
instruction
must
be
given
in
the
light
of
the
first
amendment
in
every
case
because
of
the
very
nature
of
these
obscenity
proceedings
where
the
jury
is
really
all
to,
ready
to
convict,
without
sufficient
evidence
as
of
the
case
right
here.
the
prosecute
--
the
respondent
says
that
the
defendants,
the
--
that
the,
respondent
had
the
burden
of
proving
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here
knew
the
contents
of
the
magazine
and
knew
it
to
be
obscene
and
there
is
enough
evidence
in
this
case,
to
support
either
of
them
and
the
jury
has
no
hesitance
in
returning
its
verdict
of
guilty.
i
believe
what
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
unites
states
against
cloud
that
there
is
a
great
danger
in
this
field
because
of
the
strong
emotions
that
aroused
in
jurors
for
a
jury
to
convict
not
on
evidence
but
on
prejudice.
i
would
like
to
suggest
one
word
of
the
presumptions
if
i
may,
mr.
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you.
the
respondent
has
indicated
that
the
presumption
that
is
found
in
436
subdivision
4
was
not
used
in
this
case.
but
that's
not
so.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
that
since
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
defendant
knew
the
material
was
obscene,
the
only
way
the
case
could
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
was
to
utilize
the
presumption
that
a
person
who
sold
magazines,
found
by
a
jury
to
be
obscene,
may
meant
that
the
respondent
knew
in
fact
that
the
publications
were
obscene.
moreover,
it
caused
the
petitioner
to
take
the
stand
in
order
to
rebut
the
presumption.
the
fact
that
it
was
meaningful
in
this
case
is
found
on,
in
the
record
of
page
112
where
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner,
right
after
the
conviction,
was
complaining.
in
his
motion
for
a
dismissal,
he
points
out
that
that
statute
under
which
the
defendant
was
prosecuted
is
unconstitutional,
is
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment,
because
it
released
the
commonwealth
of
the
duty
to
prove
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
of
the
fact
of
the
obscenity
of
the
magazines
as
obscene
they
were.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
why
would
that
make
it
unconstitutional?
because
there
was
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
presumption
from
the
sale
of
the
magazine.
it
was
presumed
that
what
the
jury
found
the
magazine
to
be
obscene,
the
presumption
was
that
the
man
who
sold
the
magazine
knew
it
to
be
obscene
also
without
any
other
proof
at
all.
and
that
is
totally
arbitrary
and
it's
-
-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
in
the
case
smith
against
california
of
this
court
held,
i
believe,
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
to
make
a
bookseller
liable
merely
for
selling
a
book
unless
you
added
to
it
a
guilty
knowledge
which
smith
versus
california
required
and
we
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
that's
true.
i
believe
this
is
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said
in
a
concurring
opinion
of
mapp
against
ohio
where
the
ohio
statute
was
involved
and
plainly
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
to
say
to
a
prison
that
he
could
not
even
possess.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
had
a
constitutional
amendment
that
raised
some
problems
there
but
the
difference,
of
course,
between
liquor
and
matter
which
is
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
is
a
difference
of,
the
greatest
important,
in
which
this
court
of
course
has
noticed.
for
example,
in
the
marcus
case,
it
was
pointed
out,
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
smith,
that
there
are
many
rules
of
law
that
you
can
have
in
other
areas
which
simply
would
not
be
tolerable
in
the
area
where
the
effect
of
it
is
to
limit
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
press.
here,
what
happens
if
you
do
away
with
the
scienter
requirement
or
the
mens
rea
or
the
two,
as
we
see
it,
is
to
make
a
bookseller
a
censor.
because
of
his
timidity,
because
of
his
fear,
he
simply
is
not
going
to
circulate
the
press
and
all
of
us
will
be
the
losers.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
in
trying
to
suppress
obscene
literature,
unless
the
bookseller
has
some
breathing
space,
he
has
some
security
he
is
not
going
to
circulate
constitutionally
protected
speech
either.
he
is
not
going
to
circulate
material
which
he
believes
is
not
obscene
and
which
in
fact
is
not
obscene
but
because
of
fear,
he
simply
will
stay
clear
of
the
whole
area
whenever
a
private
group
comes
to
a
bookseller
and
says,
i
don't
like
it
whether
that
be
religious
group
or
any
other
group.
out
of
fear,
he
is
going
to
have
to
withdraw
it
and
there
isn't
a
reason
in
the
world
why
he
shouldn't
be
under
the
same
precious
ultimately
for
distributing
political
or
religious
matter
too.
today,
we
are
talking
about
sex
speech
which
is
unpopular.
but
the
rule
of
law
which
says
that
a
bookseller
can
be
made
a
criminal
because
he
distributes
works
that
somebody
doesn't
like
and
that
he
can
be
punished
upward
inevitably
has
a
very
high
potential
for
suppressing
speech.
and
unless
we
give
the
bookseller
the
kind
of
protection
that
has
been
talked
about
often
in
this
court,
that
a
bookseller
brought
up
on
a
criminal
prosecution,
is
ring
the
bell
with
all
of
these
great
protections,
unless
that
be
given
some
meaning
and
effect,
we're
going
to
have
a
(inaudible)
which
we
haven't
seen
since
salem
because
the
prosecutors
today,
under
the
pressure
of
private
groups,
are
really
running
rampant
and
booksellers
today
are
frightened
and
something
has
to
be
done.
and
pretty
soon,
to
give
them
the
kind
of
protection
so
that
they
will
be
able
to
stand
up
to
the
pressure,
otherwise,
as
i
say,
there
will
be
a
kind
of
erosion
of
the
first
amendment
that
we
could
not
tolerate.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it's
our
argument
that
unless
the
defend
--
a
bookseller,
who
sells
a
magazine
knows
it's
obscene,
he
cannot
be
found
guilty.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
he
didn't
read
it,
then
i
would
say
that
on
the
most
circumstances,
he
could
not
be
found
guilty.
i
think
there
might
be
a
situation
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
what
i
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
what
i
had
in
mind,
mr.
justice
black
was
a
situation,
for
example
where
there
had
been
a
civil
proceeding,
for
example,
and
which
a
state
have
had
an
adjudication
with
regard
to
a
book
and
found
that
the
book
is
obscene
and
then,
a
bookseller
is
notified
of
the
adjudication.
if
he
then
sells
the
book,
knowing
that
there
has
been
an
adjudication
finding
it
to
be
obscene,
then
he
has
the
requisite
guilty
knowledge
or
he
might
in
the
constitution.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
say
that
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
black.
our
argument
is
that,
in
the
ordinary
case,
there
may
be
unusual
ones,
but
in
the
ordinary
case,
unless
a
bookseller
knows
it,
either
by
way
of
some
prior
adjudication
or
he
may
--
there
may
be
admission
which
he
says,
"i
read
the
book
and
i
think
that
it
is
obscene."
but
in
the
ordinary
case
such
as
the
case
we
have
here,
what
do
we
have
but
a
man
who
handles
books
and
magazines?
the
magazines,
i
respectfully
submit,
simply
as
not
obscene
under
decision
of
this
and
virtually
every
appellate
court.
nevertheless,
he
is
found
guilty
of
it
had
he
read
the
magazines
even
he
still
in
my
judgment
would
have
to
be
found
by
a
jury
to
have
known
it
to
be
obscene
before
there
could
be
a
proper
conviction
so
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
my
argument
mr.
justice
black
is
this.
i
think
my
brief
has
made
it
plain
that
there
ought
not
to
be
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--
censorship.
but
if
we're
going
to
have
censorship,
at
least
give
the
bookseller
the
protection
which
has
been
promised
to
him.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
we're
going
to
have
it,
we
should
make
it
as
limited
as
possible.
i
don't
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
an
evil,
once
it's
there,
we
may
as
well
have
it
in
its
worse
form.
it's
bad
enough
to
have
a
little
evil
without
having
a
program
going
to
foot.
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
if
we
got
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
we
have
two
--
we
have
two
problems,
mr.
justice
black.
the
first
one
is
the
one
you're
raising
in
terms
of
censorship.
and
if
we're
going
to
have
that
i
think
you're
right
that
in
a
long
run
of
expense.
it's
the
nature
of
censorship
to
just
grow
and
grow
and
grow.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
a
problem
of
due
process
and
an
individual,
a
person
who
would
perform
a
usual
function
of
society,
a
bookseller,
i'm
addressing
myself
now
to
the
due
process
argument
as
apart
from
the
first
amendment
argument
although
it
interlocks,
that
at
least
if
we're
going
to
have
book,
if
we're
going
to
have
book
censorship
don't
make
criminals
out
of
the
booksellers
at
the
same
time.
if
we're
going
to
have
censorship,
maybe
what,
your
honor,
suggested
in
the
ginzburg
case
is
to
set
up
a
bureau,
set
up
a
censor
and
say
this
is
what
we
can
do
and
this
is
what
we
can't
do
and
let's
be
open
about
it
that
we're
engaging
in
censorship
in
united
states
of
america
today,
if
that's
what
we're
going
to
do.
what
i'm
arguing
for,
though,
is
that
the
bookseller,
the
retailer,
the
wholesaler
and
the
publisher
shouldn't
be
made
criminals
in
the
process
for
doing
an
act
which
they
couldn't
possibly
know
as
a
crime
at
the
time
they
were
doing
it.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
if
you
have
an
in
rem
proceeding
in
which
there
is
a
censor
or
adjudication
of
some
kind
where
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
"this
is
what
you
cannot
sell."
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i'm
saying
that
that
is
a
certainly
preferable
to
the
procedure
we
have
now.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
i
want
to
make
it
plain
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
let
me
just
in
passing
say
that
i
find
that
intolerable
really
but
the
lesser
of
two
evils,
i
find
the
present
criminal
situation.
there
are
two
grounds
where
as
the
arkansas
type
situation
is
bad
on
only
one
ground
and
a
very
important
one.
it's
bad
because
it
brings
about
censorship
and
i
think
censorship
is
bad.
these
criminal
prosecutions
are
doubly
bad.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
on
that
premise,
i
believe
that
the
arkansas
type
situation
is
more
tolerable
but
not
good.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
on
the
clipping,
i'm
not
positive,
it's
certainly
was
done
on
the
orders
of
the
petitioner.
and,
i
believe
that
it
was
the
petitioner
who
physically
took
the
girlie
magazines
that
were
in
the
read
more
store
and
placed
them
in
a
rack
behind
the
counter
after
he
have
had
the
meeting
of
the
ministers
association.
i'd
like
to
make
it
plain
though
that
in
that
regard
that
these
were,
these
are
not
under
the
counter.
sometimes,
it's
thought
as
under
the
counter.
they
were
on
rocks,
in
view
but
what
the
effect
of
this
was
that
a
person
couldn't
go
there
and
thumb
through
it.
he
had
to
ask
some
specific
magazine
by
title.
as
mrs.
wolfen
did,
she
came
and
she
said,
i
would
like
four
magazines
and
she
gave
the
names
of
the
magazines
she
wanted.
two
of
them
were
out
of
stock,
two
of
them
she
purchased.
but
the
answer
to
your
two
questions
is,
certainly
the
petitioner
knew
that
he
had
girlie
magazines.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
there
were
30
that
were
place
there
subsequent
to
the
meeting
he
had
with
the
ministers.
but
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
that,
mr.
justice
black
because
although
we
talk
about
only
25
or
only
30
magazines,
in
the
marcus
case
where
the
police
were
after
what
they
thought
was
obscene
material,
there
were
280
publications
that
when
the
police
marched
in
there,
they
picked
up
280
different
titles
in
bantam
where
you
had
the
road
island
morality
commission,
they
had
a
list
of
106.
we
are
not
talking
about
25
or
30
magazines.
the
minute
the
censor
get
its
foot
on
the
door,
it's
2
today
and
it's
75
tomorrow
and
it's
300
before
the
end
of
the
month.
so
that
in
the
end,
if
the
bookseller
has
to
start
examining
the
material
that
the
censor
whether
he
be
a
private
or
non-private
persons
says,
watch
out,
we're
talking
about
examining
virtually
everything
that
it's
in
the
bookstore.
and
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
black,
with
regard
to
the
number
of
titles
that
were
in
the
store,
the
11,000
which
were
allotted
to
for
kentucky,
i
think
the
record
says
that
they
were
there.
it
wasn't
that
many
sale,
11,000
each
month.
they
have
some
books
that
are
there
for
a
long
period
of
time
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
and
in
the
very
nature
of
things,
the
way
the
industry
works,
each
month
the
national
distributor
send
them
a
whole
new
batch
of
books
and
magazines
and
the
old
ones
go
out
for
which
creditors
given
to
the
retailers.
so
there
is
a
great
deal
of
movement,
back
and
forth,
but
there
aren't
that
many
sales
unfortunately
in
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
say
that
that
is
the
rule
that
i
would
favor.
i
recognize,
of
course,
that's
not
the
rule
of
this
court
and
i'm
accepting
as
mr.
justice
harlan
properly
admonished
me
to
accept
the
fact
that
we
do
have
an
obscenity
law.
but
i
do
think
that
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
that
is
censorship,
surely.
a
criminal
conviction
such
as
we
had
here
of
the
petitioner
is
censorship
and
as
real
they
sensed,
as
if
we
had
the
kind
of
restraint
that
was
true
in
kingsley
or
in
the
arkansas
court.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
frankfurt
have
pointed
out
quite
correctly
in
the
kingsley
book
case
that
the
terror
that
a
bookseller
feels
for
--
out
of
fear
of
a
criminal
prosecution
can
work
a
suppression
of
material,
which
is
really
censorship,
more
lawful
than
a
prior
restraint
canon
enlarged.
that's
in
particularly
where
the
rules
are
very
lax
where
the
standards
are
of
obscenity
are
unknown
and
where
a
defendant,
a
publisher
or
a
bookseller
ends
up
without
any
real
defense.
the
kind
of
trial
that
mr.
austin
had
here
is
no
different
really
from
the
kind
of
trial
you
will
have
before
a
censorship
board.
what
is
it?
you
take
that
magazine,
you
throw
them
before
people
and
the
prosecutor
says,
"you
don't
like
them,
do
you.
you
don't
want
these
in
your
home,
do
you?
you
wouldn't
want
your
children
to
read
it!?
that's
the
kind
of
argument
you
make
to
a
censorship
board
and
it's
a
censorship
in
practice
and
in
operation
and
evidence
effect.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
that
is
not
my
position
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
like
to
state
this
first
that
if
we're
talking
about
adults
and
the
rights
of
adults
to
read,
either
the
most
obnoxious
sexual
material
or
the
most
obnoxious
political
material
or
the
most
obnoxious
religious
material,
i
believe
that
in
a
free
society
that
the
adult
must
be
permitted
to
read
it.
and
if
he's
going
to
be
permitted
to
read
it,
he
must
be
able
to
obtain
it
and
that
would
require
the
rule,
as
i
would
see
it
that
adults
should
have
the
permission
to
read
and
to
purchase
material
of
any
kind.
now,
the
suggestion
made
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
jacobellis
is
a
suggestion
which
i
think
makes
sense
and
constitutionally,
i
believe
stands
on
a
much
stronger
footing.
and
that
is,
with
regard
to
minors,
with
regard
to
persons
who
are
unable
to
make
judgments.
there
is
room,
i
think,
for
some
kind
of
an
accommodation
with
regard
to
keeping
out
of
the
hands
of
minors
in
something
like
the
same
passion
that
liquor
or
cigarettes
are
kept
from
minors.
but
when
we're
talking
about
adults,
they
are
said,
mr.
justice
black
was
correct
in
terms
of
how
old
was
the
man,
the
witness
for
the
petitioner
who
looked
at
the
material
and
he
was
saying
that
it
didn't
appeal
to
prurient
interest
and
the
like.
i
think
that
most
adults,
all
adults,
if
we're
talking
about
the
average
normal
adult
is
totally
able
to
handle
sexual
material
just
as
surely
as
he
was
able
to
handle
terrible
political
material.
it's
such
an
anomaly
to
say
that
we
can
trust
adults
in
all
these
other
areas.
but
somehow,
he
goes
to
pieces
when
he
sees
something
that
is
very
strong.
however,
you
want
to
form
it
and
talk
about
it
in
the
sexual
sense.
if
we
come
down
to
the
path
that's
really
just
like
we
get
used
to,
i
saw
on
nbc
today
on
television,
morning.
but
if
we
on
a
news,
much
more
fright,
much
more
fright
than
any
of
the
news
in
these
two
magazines.
they
were
completely
revealed
and
there
wasn't
any
feeling.
i
mean,
we
get
used
to
certain
things
one
way
or
the
other.
ten
years
ago,
we
would
have
thought
that
the
american
people
couldn't
possibly
tolerate
it.
now,
in
the
morning
show
on
today
on
nbc
in
washington,
it's
there
and
i
think
that
we
see,
for
example,
that
the
american
people
has
been
able
to
read
tropic
of
cancer,
tropic
of
capricorn
without
the
words
for
it.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
was
today?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it's
called
today
it
was
on
--
before
i
went
to
put
this
morning
and
it
was,
i
think
it
we
would
be
very
interesting
to
have
a
rerun
of
it
and
compare
it.
compare
it
with
the
pictures
here
and
i
can
only
assure
you
that
the
nudes
there
are
far
more
revealing,
far
more
seductive
than
any
of
the
pictures
in
these
magazines.
what
are
we
then
talking
about
in
terms
of
all
the
need
to
censor?
people
can
read
these
things
and
look
at
it
without
our
society
falling
of
-
-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
the
case
of
prince
against
new
hampshire,
if
my
memory
serves
me.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
the
case
of
prince
against
new
hampshire,
if
my
memory
serves
right
has
drawn
a
constitutional
line
between
saying
that
children
for
example
may
not
be
as
free
to
go
on
the
streets
and
circulate
petitions
as
adults
would
be.
that
is
a
limitation
upon
an
adult
would
have
violated
the
constitution
whereas,
constitutionally
speaking,
we
said
that
it
would
be
proper
to
have
that
limitation
with
regard
to
youth.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
i,
that
i
would
be
saying
so.
yes,
that
we
could
say
that
material
which
an
adult
has
the
right
to
read
and
therefore
our
society
cannot
punish
a
person
for
making
it
available
might
nevertheless
be
punishable
if
it
is
sold
to
a
child,
and
particularly
if
it
is
sold
to
a
child
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
some
improper
conduct.
but
i
think
that
the
limitation
might
be
fairly
drawn
as
mr.
justice
brennan
had
indicated
in
jacobellis
with
a
statute
which
says,
you
cannot
sell
or
make
available
to
youth
certain
types
of
material
which
material
is
otherwise
generally
available
to
the
adult
population.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
could
not
do
it
anymore
fairly
than
in
the
prince
case
it
was
the
same
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
i
can't
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
cannot
give
you
the
answer
of
that.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
that
is
a
portion
of
the
judgment
that
a,
in
a
free
society
we
make
an
assumption
and
that
assumption
is,
that
adults
for
example,
can
do
things
that
youth
cannot
it.
if
something
like,
i
would
suspect
that
the
notion
of
voting,
you
arbitrarily
say
that
at
certain
age,
a
person
is
unable
to
vote
and
therefore,
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
franchise.
but
i
would
say
that
it
would
be.
if
you
take
the
position
that
there
can
be
no
limitation
of
any
kind,
then
we
would
have
to
say
the
same
is
true
with
regard
to
children.
i
am
taking
a
position,
some
play
short
of
that
in
terms
of
saying
that
the
limitation
has
to
be
as
narrow
as
the
requirements
that
we
feel
have
to
be
filled
are.
if
we
say
there
is
a
problem
and
the
problem
is
children,
then
a
statute,
in
order
to
be
valid
ought
to
be
as
narrow
as
the
need
so
that
we
say,
using
the
principle
that
when
we
invade
the
free
speech
area,
we
have
to
use
the
narrowest
rule
that
we
can
use.
if
we
take
that
approach,
i
would
say
this
is
a
narrower
rule
than
one
would
say
that
adults
would
have
to
be
have
a
material
beyond
their
reach
also.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
narrower
rule,
it's
the
narrowest
rule
that
one
can
draw
and
therefore
it
is
the
one
that
ought
to
be
accepted.
if
we
agree
that
the
problem
is
youth
then
that
adult
at
least
are
able
to
handle
it
then
we
should
have
a
statue
which
says
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
there
has
been
some
-
-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
has
been,
there
has
been
---
mr.
stanley
fleishman
your
honor,
it's
quite
right.
however,
on
the
same
rule
i
suppose
that
sometimes
after
considering
the
case,
this
court
has
determined
that
certiorari
has
been
improvidently
granted.
this
court
may
be
of
the
view
that
certiorari
was
improvidently
restricted
here
and
perhaps
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
that
in
this
case,
it
was
due
respect.
i
think
that
the
issues
ought
to
be
more
fully
explored.
the
instructions
were
plainly
wrong.
the
determination
of
obscenity
was
plainly
wrong.
and
i
think
that
the
discussion
we're
having
here
now
is
perhaps
whether
or
not
certiorari
on
broader
terms
ought
not
to
be
granted
with
full
argument
and
opportunity
to
respond
into,
address
himself
to
the
full
issues.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
almost
three
years
to
the
date,
a
private
citizen,
a
mrs.
catherine
wolfen,
walked
into
the
read
more
bookstore
in
paducah,
kentucky
and
ordered
three
books,
two
magazines
rather.
she
ordered
four
and
she
purchased
two
magazines
the
required
title.
she
then
marched
over
to
the
mccracken
county
court
house
and
swore
out
a
complaint
in
statutory
language.
he
said
that
mr.
austin,
the
owner
of
the
store,
had
violated
the
kentucky
obscenity
law.
the
basis
of
her
charge
was
that
purchase
by
her
and
her
reading
of
the
magazines
in
her
conclusion
based
on
no
judicial
standards
that
the
magazines
were
in
fact
obscene.
the
statute
involved
provides
that
any
person
who
sells
an
obscene
book
or
magazine,
knowing
the
contents
or
character
is
guilty
of
an
offense.
the
statute
also
provides
that
any
person
who
sells
a
publication
found
by
the
jury
to
be
obscene
is
presumed
to
know
the
obscene
character
of
the
work.
now
the
evidence
against
mr.
austin
is
very
simple.
mr.
austin
stipulated
that
he
was
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
bookstore.
mrs.
wolfen
testified
that
she
had
called
up
a
friend
of
hers
and
said,
“i'm
going
to
make
a
buy
at
read
more
come
on
down
and
be
witness.”
and
she
made
a
buy.
she
stated
that
the
magazines
were
in
a
rack
behind
the
cash
register
and
she's
testified
that
they
were
in
this
rack
behind
the
cash
register
because
a
ministerial
association
had
asked
mr.
austin
to
take
them
out
of
reach
of
minors.
and
so,
mr.
austin
to
accommodate
himself
to
this
request
took
them
and
put
them
behind
the
cash
register,
where
only
a
person
who
ordered
the
magazines
by
title
could
get
them
and
where
no
minors
could
get.
the
only
other
evidence
in
the
case
is
the
testimony
of
reverend
simpson,
a
member
of
the
citizens
for
decent
literature
and
the
head
of
the
moral
and
social
welfare
committee
of
the
paducah
ministerial
association.
he
testified
that
he
had
asked
mr.
austin
to
come
down
to
a
meeting
that
the
ministers
had
to
discuss
objectionable
material.
at
that
time
mr.
austin
told
the
ministers,
that
if
they
had
any
specific
publications
they
thought
were
obscene
to
tell
him
and
he
would
remove
them.
and
the
ministers
in
effect
said,
“get
rid
of
all
of
them.”
that's
the
sum
in
substance
of
what
they
say.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
get
them
--
get
rid
of
all.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
magazines
are
contained
any
nudes
at
least.
that
was
the
short
of
it
and
that's
what
the
state
recognized
in
their
argument,
if
your
honor
please.
in
their
final
argument
to
the
jury,
they
pointed
out
that
in
effect
the
ministers
told
them
to
get
rid
of
playboy
now
and
forever.
not
just
playboy
may
but
playboy
so
that
there
won't
be
any
doubt
about
it
and
the
language
is
clear.
this
is
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor
to
the
jury.
they're
talking
about
mrs.wolfen
as
the
censor.
i'm
talking
on
page
86
of
the
record.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
hold
mrs.
catherine
wolfen
out
as
the
censor
of
mccracken
county.
she
is
not.
neither
of
the
ministers
the
censors
of
the
mccracken
county
and
they
have
got
no
obligation
to
any
person
to
go
out
and
censor
the
material
as
on
the
stands
in
paducah.
they
recognized
that
fact.
that's
a
dangerous
situation
but
what
did
they
do?
they
had
a
meeting,
two
meetings,
as
i
recall
the
testimony.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
with
the
prosecutor.
yes,
your
honor.
the
last
one
in
may
of
1963,
and
the
objection
on
the
part
of
the
ministers
was
all
of
the
material
that
he
called
adult
reading.
they
objected
to
it,
all
of
it.
there
weren't
going
to
specify
this
issue,
that
issue
or
some
other
issue.
they
told
him
that
they
objected
to
all
of
it
if
they
should,
why
if
they
have
told
him
they
object
to
the
may
issue
of
playboy
magazine.
all
they
would
have
to
do
is
put
on
the
june.
that's
what
we
have.
this
is
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
evidence
upon
which
petitioner
was
convicted.
now
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner
sought
to
show
that
he
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
magazines
were
not
obscene.
he
tried
to
show
it
in
a
variety
of
ways.
first,
he
tried
to
show
that
he
tried
to
limit
himself
only
to
those
magazines
which
had
second
class
mailing
privileges
from
the
post
office
department.
a
magazine
that
has
second
class
mailing
privileges
is
presumed
to
be
not
obscene
because
the
post
office
department
has
no
right
to
issue
second
class
mailing
privileges
to
obscene
publications.
he
tried
to
show
that
he
couldn't
possibly
read
the
11
or
12,000
magazines
that
were
in
his
store
at
all
times.
he
tried
to
show
that
for
years
he
had
been
distributing
exactly
the
same
type
of
magazine
over
a
four-state
area,
tennessee,
kentucky,
missouri
and
illinois.
he
tried
to
show
that
this
court
had
found
nudist
magazines
far
more
revealing
than
the
two
magazines
involved.
but
this
court
have
them
to
be
not
obscene
and
he
tried
to
show
that
in
the
paducah
library,
there
were
books
containing
portrayals
of
nudes
which
were
in
every
respect
as
frank
and
as
candid
as
those
in
the
magazines
involved
here.
all
of
these
were
totally
excluded
by
the
trial
court
and
consistent
with
the
rulings
or
with
these
rulings
of
the
trial
court.
the
judge
refused
to
give
an
instruction
requested
by
the
petitioner
that
if
the
jury
found
that
he
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
magazines
were
not
obscene,
the
jury
should
acquit.
it's
indicated
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
and
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
grant
a
motion
to
appeal
with
the
chief
justice
dissenting.
so
the
first
question
we
have
here
is
the
one
left
open
in
smith
against
california
is
a
good
faith
belief
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
the
books
he
handles
himself
are
not
obscene,
a
defense
to
a
obscenity
prosecution.
now,
we
touch
--
it
was
touch
upon
in
the
last
page
but
it
does
repetition,
that
there
are
two
important
considerations
involved
in
the
smith
rule.
the
first
one
is
that
obscenity
is
defined
by
this
court
is
extraordinarily
vague.
and
if
a
bookseller
faced
with
a
very
vague
law
can
be
held
criminally
liable
when
he
believes
that
the
publication
is
in
all
respect
lawful.
he
either
goes
out
of
the
business
or
he
goes
into
a
business
where
the
risk
is
higher
than
in
any
other
lawful
business.
and
we're
talking
about
bookstores
where
ordinarily
we
want
to
give
maximum
and
not
minimum
protection.
the
other
alternative
to
going
out
of
the
business
is
to
handle
only
cook
books
and
even
those
aren't
so
safe
because
there
are
so
aphrodisiac
books
on
eating.
now,
the
respondent
here
advances
three
reasons
for
denying
to
the
petitioner
the
right
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
he
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
magazines
in
questions
were
not
obscene
and
in
justifying
the
trial
court's
refusal
to
grant
the
requested
instruction.
first
of
all,
the
respondent
says
that
the
evidence
against
petitioner
is
so
conclusive,
so
overwhelming
that
nobody
knowing
the
facts
that
petitioner
knew
could
have
--
could
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
they
were
not
obscene.
now
what
is
this
overwhelming
evidence?
the
overwhelming
evidence
is
that
the
petitioner
may
have
no
one
that
he
had
in
his
store
magazines
which
contain
portrayals
of
nudes,
that's
all
and
this
in
the
face
of
untold
holdings
by
this
court
and
other
courts
that
nudity
is
not
synonymous
with
obscenity.
the
second
reason
given
by
the
respondent
is
that
petitioner
couldn't
ask
and
expect
to
get
the
instruction
on
good
faith
belief
because
he
said,
he
never
read
the
books,
the
magazines
in
the
first
instance
and
so,
the
respondent
argues.
how
can
he
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
magazines
are
not
obscene
without
looking
at
them?
respondent
argues
that
before
a
petitioner,
before
a
bookseller
may
claim
the
right
to
a
good
--
to
the
defense
of
good
faith
belief
that
the
material
is
not
obscene.
he
will
have
to
take
the
stand
and
in
effect
incriminate
himself.
that
is
to
say
the
prosecutor
wants
him
to
get
him
on
the
stand
and
say,
“i
read
the
book
so
magazines.”
and
then
from
that
they'll
say
uh-huh,
he
read
the
books
and
magazines
and
that's
proof
enough.
and
then
the
prosecutor
respondent
finally
says
that
the
instruction
shouldn't
have
been
given
because
of
rosen
against
united
states.
and
that
rosen
against
united
states
indeed
means
that
the
good
faith
belief
on
the
part
of
the
bookseller
that
the
material
he
sells
is
not
obscene
is
irrelevant.
with
all
due
respect,
we
suggest
that
the
rosen
case
should
not
be
controlling
here.
first
of
all,
rosen
was
decided,
it's
almost
70
years
now,
at
that
time
when
there
were
no
first
amendment
considerations
involved
or
implicated.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
was
a
federal
case,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
none
were
raised
and
none
were
discussed.
the
entire
case
was
treated
as
if
the
first
amendment
had
no
application.
i
think
it
might
have
been
argued
and
discussed
in
a
different
fashion
but
as
it
was
handled.
it
was
no
first
amendment
considerations
were
brought
to
play
nor
considered
in
the
case.
secondly,
rosen
of
course
was
decided
the
time
when
hicklin
controls.
now,
a
determination
of
obscenity
under
hicklin
is
quite
different
from
a
determination
of
obscenity
under
roth,
alberts
as
expanded
by
the
various
cases
of
this
court.
under
hicklin
everything
was
intuitive.
there
were
no
outside
considerations
if
person
look
at
something
that
he
didn't
like
it
or
he
thought
it
might
offend
the
most
susceptible
person
that
was
it.
and
the
fact
is
that
at
the
present
time
it
is
simply
irrational
to
assume
or
as
previously
been
discussed
that
a
person
who
reads
the
book
or
reads
the
magazine
knows
merely
from
the
reading
that
the
publication
offends
the
obscenity
law.
that
is
to
say
that
from
reading
it
one
would
know
that
it
goes
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor,
appeals
to
prurient
interest,
and
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
earlier,
if
members
of
this
court
have
good
faith
and
honest
disagreement
among
their
selves
with
regard
to
whether
a
particular
book
is
or
is
not
obscene.
surely
that
in
itself
proves
that
there
is
room
at
least
for
honest
difference
of
opinion
with
regard
to
persons
who
look
at
the
material
and
reach
contrary
completions.
as
indicated,
the
kentucky
revised
statutes
provides
in
43600
subdivision
4
that
the
sale
of
a
publication
found
by
a
jury
to
be
obscene
is
presumed
to
that
the
seller
is
presumed
to
know
that
it
was
obscene.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
statute?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thats
the
mere
sale,
the
mere
sale
without
knowing
the
contents
of
the
publication
that
is
to
say
in
this
case,
merely
because
the
two
magazines
were
sold
that
brought
the
presumption
into
being
and
under
the
statute.
he
was
presumed
to
know
of
the
obscene
character
of
the
work.
now
in
the
face
of
this
presumption,
the
petitioner
sought
to
adduce
evidence
to
negate
it.
he
certainly
was
putting
on
evidence
which
was
relevant
to
his
good
faith.
it
is,
justice
harlan,
indicated
in
the
smith
case,
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
put
on
evidence
showing
that
a
work
doesn't
go
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor
on
the
issue
of
obscenity.
then
he
has
a
light
right,
we
respectfully
submit
to
put
on
evidence
to
show
that
the
hidden
belief
the
material
is
obscene
which
is
what
he
sought
to
do
in
all
of
which
was
totally
excluded
so
that
on
that
constitutional
issue
of
scienter.
there
was
a
totally
exclusion
of
evidence.
i
should
point
out
as
we
have
in
our
reply
brief
that
after
the
case
here
and
effective
june
of
this
year,
kentucky
repealed
the
statute
and
amended
and
enacted
a
new
law
and
specifically
found
or
in
these
new
statutes,
specifically
sets
the
standard
as
knowledge
of
obscenity.
that
is
to
say
under
the
law
in
kentucky
as
it
is
exists
today,
a
person
who
sells
a
publication
found
to
be
obscene
must
--
the
prosecution
must
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
he
had
knowledge
that
the
work
was
obscene
and
the
statute
as
it
now
exists
has
eliminated
the
presumption
which
was
working
against
the
petitioner
in
the
case
at
the
time
that
he
went
to
trial
and
at
the
time
that
he
was
convicted.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
excluded
evidence
was
offered
on
both
issues
because
for
the
most
thought
it
bore
on
both
the
issue
of
whether
the
publications
were
obscene
and
also
bore
on
whether
he
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
it
was
not
obscene.
there
was
some
evidence
however
which
would
have
been
directed
solely
at
his
good
faith
belief
that
it
was
not
obscene.
that
was
the
evidence
where
he
sought
to
show
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
examined
the
11,000
or
12,000
publications
that
he
had
in
his
bookstore
at
all
time.
that
was
excluded
and
i
assume
that
was
directed
solely
to
the
question
of
scienter.
but
the
other
evidence,
the
broad
sale
of
playboy
magazine,
rouge
magazine,
and
others
which
the
petitioner
said
were
all
about
the
same
as
the
two
magazines
involved
his
evidence
with
regard
to
the
second
class
mailing
privileges
enjoyed
by
these
magazines
would
have
gone
to
both
of
the
issues.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
he
received
a
sentence
of
$250.00.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
was
no
jail
sentence
in
this
case,
your
honor.
now,
there
is
--
i
think
a
consideration
here
that
your
honors
ought
to
give
weight
to.
in
the
case
of
bantam
books
against
sullivan,
this
court
was
very
anxious
to
see
that
a
bookseller
or
a
distributor
not
suppressed
books
when
those
who
were
operating
were
doing
so
outside
of
a
judicial
framework
and
not
consistent
with
--
not
consistent
with
legal
standards.
and
so
it
was
that
the
rhode
island
commission
on
morality
which
was
sending
out
notices
not
to
distribute
this
or
not
to
distribute
that
was
found
to
be
offending
the
constitution
and
the
effect
of
these
notices
was
seen
and
recognized
in
the
court
when
the
distributor
in
rhode
island
sees
distributing
each
and
every
one
of
the
books
and
magazines
and
there
were
106
of
them
which
the
rhode
island
commission
condemned.
this
court
was
pointed
out
that
in
this
fashion
--
in
this
fashion
much
material
which
was
constitutionally
protected
was
being
suppressed.
now
turning
to
this
case
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
austin
was
faced
with
a
problem.
there
was
a
psychological
warfare
going
on
paducah,
kentucky
three
years
ago.
mrs.
wolfen
was
coming
down
to
the
bookstore
and
making
purchases
regularly,
twice
before
this
faithful
day.
she
had
made
other
purchases
of
magazines,
twice.
mr.
austin
was
called
before
this
ministerial
association.
now
he
had
a
choice
to
make.
he
either
could
say,
i
vow
and
i
take
everything
out
of
my
newsstand
or
he
should
say,
as
i
understood
this
court
was
encouraging
distributors
to
say
in
the
bantam
books
case,
there
shouldn't
be
suppression
of
material
which
is
not
obscene.
he
made
his
judgment
that
these
magazines
were
not
obscene
in
law.
he
tried
as
a
businessman
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
pressures
that
were
put.
but
if
he
has
denied
the
protection
of
the
law
under
this
circumstance
and
he
can
be
branded
a
criminal
because
he
didn't
vow
totally
to
the
pressures
that
were
put,
then
we
will
have
more
suppression,
far
more
suppression
than
was
have
put
bantam
books
against
sullivan.
and
i
will
say
that
if
mr.
austin
is
a
criminal
for
having
had
sold
and
he
didn't
do
the
selling,
it
was
his
clerk.
if
he
is
a
criminal
because
they
were
sold
in
his
bookstore,
these
two
magazines
which
are
no
different
from
any
number
of
magazines
which
are
circulating
throughout
the
country
today
and
continuously,
then
every
bookseller
and
every
wholesaler
in
the
united
states
of
america
is
today
a
criminal.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
law
can
be
such
that
we
either
disregard
all
this
criminality
or
that
we
end
up
with
the
kind
of
suppression
that
is
inherent
in
this
conviction.
the
only
way,
we
respectfully
submit,
that
the
bookseller
can
have
any
confidence
in
carrying
out
his
business
in
a
lawful
way
is
to
receive
the
kind
of
legal
protection
that
was
promised
in
smith
and
the
promised
has
not
been
fulfilled.
at
least
in
smith,
the
thought
was
apart
in
around
that
a
bookseller
who
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
what
he
was
doing
was
lawful
could
not
be
made
a
criminal.
we
are
aware
of
course
of
the
problems
that
are
always
pointed
to
in
terms
of,
if
the
prosecution
must
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
work
was
obscene
that
there
would
not
be
many
convictions.
nor
should
that
be.
the
number
of
convictions
that
are
coming
out
in
the
united
states
of
america
today
for
selling
books
is
astounding.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
have
not
collected
them.
i
have
received
however
a
report
from
the
citizens
for
decent
literature
that
it
seems
to
have
collected
them
and
they
run
into
the
many
hundreds,
many
hundreds
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
annually.
yes.
its
fright
--
it's
really
frightening
what
is
going
on
with
regard
to
these
new
standards
that
have
been
coming
out
in
this
field
of
obscenity.
but
the
problem
is
not
really
even
to
have
to
tolerate
material
with
society
has
a
legitimate
right
to
suppress.
there
are
other
weapons
available.
we
are
familiar
with
the
fact
that
there
are
in
rem
proceedings
where
material
which
is
thought
to
be
obscene
can
be
suppress
without
criminalizing
an
innocent
man
for
selling
it.
and
while
this
is
a
great
evil
to
have
this
kind
of
prior
restraint
as
mr.
justice
black
indicated
in
the
ginzburg
case,
it's
less
of
an
evil
than
sending
man
to
jail
for
25
years
or
10
years
or
5
years.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
under
the
limited
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
under
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
it's
obscene,
although,
i'll
tell
you
quite
frankly
that
they
are
not
obscene
the
magazines.
they
are
simply
are
not
but
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
has
a
bearing
of
course,
i
believe
that
there
are
some
materials
which
would
be
so
very
powerful
that
he
denied
by
a
person
who
read
it
that
he
thought
it
was
not
obscene
would
not
be
given
great
way.
on
the
contrary,
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
you
take
a
playboy
magazine
and
if
he
says,
i
really
think
playboy
is
not
obscene.
i've
been
fine
to
think
that
we'd
all
agree
with
him
at
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
in
this
case,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
there
are
answers
sufficient
in
our
case
but
in
any
case
surely
to
go
the
scienter.
you
have
to
know
what's
involved.
i
think
our
case
because
we
really
raise
questions
of
instructions
for
the
most
part.
we're
in
a
position
to
get
a
ruling
to
here
because
what
if
we
have
ask
for
an
instruction
of
the
court
saying
that,
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
it
was
not
was
obscene
then
acquit.
we
believe
we're
entitled
to
that
instruction
in
any
case
no
matter
how
rough
the
material
may
be,
the
defendant
should
always
have
that
instruction.
the
jury
may
not
think
much
of
his
defense
but
he
ought
to
be
--
have
that
defense
available
to
him.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
time,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
to
matter
raised
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
that
was
whether
or
not
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury
that
they
must
find
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
knew
the
contents
and
the
character
of
the
material
was
such
that
the
jury
knew
that
they
had
to
find,
as
the
state
conceived
they
had
to
affirm
that
he
knew
the
material
was
in
fact
obscene.
the
plain
answer
is,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
jury
could
not
have
so
understood
it.
and
i
call
attention
to
page
23
of
the
record
and
there,
the
witness
was
reverend
simpson.
he
was
asked
about
two
magazines
not
the
two
magazines
involved
in
this
case
but
two
other
girlie
magazines
that
were
shown
to
mr.
austin
at
the
time
of
his
meeting
with
the
ministerial
association.
objection
was
made
to
the
showing
of
these
other
magazines
on
the
ground
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
and
the
court,
that
i
will
let
the
jury
consider
it
for
the
purpose
of
whether
or
not
he
had
knowledge
of
the
class
or
character.
it's
plain,
therefore,
that
what
was
meant
by
"character"
was,
that
mr.
austin
knew
that
he
had
girlie
magazines
and
only
that.
not
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
two
specific
magazines
involved
and
surely
not
that
he
knew
that
the
two
specific
magazines
involved
were
in
fact
obscene.
now,
in
light
of
the
concession
by
the
respondent
that
the
state
did
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
defendant
knew
the
material
wasn't
in
fact
obscene,
in
light
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
instruction
given
where
it
was
never
stated
to
the
jury
that
they
had
to
find
that
he
knew
the
magazine
was
obscene,
then
surely
the
defendant
requested
instruction
that
he
should
be
found
not
guilty.
if
the
jury
found
that
he
in
good
faith
believe
that
to
be
not
obscene,
should
have
been
given.
and
we
submit
that
such
an
instruction
must
be
given
in
the
light
of
the
first
amendment
in
every
case
because
of
the
very
nature
of
these
obscenity
proceedings
where
the
jury
is
really
all
to,
ready
to
convict,
without
sufficient
evidence
as
of
the
case
right
here.
the
prosecute
--
the
respondent
says
that
the
defendants,
the
--
that
the,
respondent
had
the
burden
of
proving
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here
knew
the
contents
of
the
magazine
and
knew
it
to
be
obscene
and
there
is
enough
evidence
in
this
case,
to
support
either
of
them
and
the
jury
has
no
hesitance
in
returning
its
verdict
of
guilty.
i
believe
what
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
unites
states
against
cloud
that
there
is
a
great
danger
in
this
field
because
of
the
strong
emotions
that
aroused
in
jurors
for
a
jury
to
convict
not
on
evidence
but
on
prejudice.
i
would
like
to
suggest
one
word
of
the
presumptions
if
i
may,
mr.
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you.
the
respondent
has
indicated
that
the
presumption
that
is
found
in
436
subdivision
4
was
not
used
in
this
case.
but
that's
not
so.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
that
since
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
defendant
knew
the
material
was
obscene,
the
only
way
the
case
could
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
was
to
utilize
the
presumption
that
a
person
who
sold
magazines,
found
by
a
jury
to
be
obscene,
may
meant
that
the
respondent
knew
in
fact
that
the
publications
were
obscene.
moreover,
it
caused
the
petitioner
to
take
the
stand
in
order
to
rebut
the
presumption.
the
fact
that
it
was
meaningful
in
this
case
is
found
on,
in
the
record
of
page
112
where
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner,
right
after
the
conviction,
was
complaining.
in
his
motion
for
a
dismissal,
he
points
out
that
that
statute
under
which
the
defendant
was
prosecuted
is
unconstitutional,
is
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment,
because
it
released
the
commonwealth
of
the
duty
to
prove
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
of
the
fact
of
the
obscenity
of
the
magazines
as
obscene
they
were.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
why
would
that
make
it
unconstitutional?
because
there
was
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
presumption
from
the
sale
of
the
magazine.
it
was
presumed
that
what
the
jury
found
the
magazine
to
be
obscene,
the
presumption
was
that
the
man
who
sold
the
magazine
knew
it
to
be
obscene
also
without
any
other
proof
at
all.
and
that
is
totally
arbitrary
and
it's
-
-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
in
the
case
smith
against
california
of
this
court
held,
i
believe,
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
to
make
a
bookseller
liable
merely
for
selling
a
book
unless
you
added
to
it
a
guilty
knowledge
which
smith
versus
california
required
and
we
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
that's
true.
i
believe
this
is
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said
in
a
concurring
opinion
of
mapp
against
ohio
where
the
ohio
statute
was
involved
and
plainly
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
to
say
to
a
prison
that
he
could
not
even
possess.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
had
a
constitutional
amendment
that
raised
some
problems
there
but
the
difference,
of
course,
between
liquor
and
matter
which
is
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
is
a
difference
of,
the
greatest
important,
in
which
this
court
of
course
has
noticed.
for
example,
in
the
marcus
case,
it
was
pointed
out,
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
smith,
that
there
are
many
rules
of
law
that
you
can
have
in
other
areas
which
simply
would
not
be
tolerable
in
the
area
where
the
effect
of
it
is
to
limit
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
press.
here,
what
happens
if
you
do
away
with
the
scienter
requirement
or
the
mens
rea
or
the
two,
as
we
see
it,
is
to
make
a
bookseller
a
censor.
because
of
his
timidity,
because
of
his
fear,
he
simply
is
not
going
to
circulate
the
press
and
all
of
us
will
be
the
losers.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
in
trying
to
suppress
obscene
literature,
unless
the
bookseller
has
some
breathing
space,
he
has
some
security
he
is
not
going
to
circulate
constitutionally
protected
speech
either.
he
is
not
going
to
circulate
material
which
he
believes
is
not
obscene
and
which
in
fact
is
not
obscene
but
because
of
fear,
he
simply
will
stay
clear
of
the
whole
area
whenever
a
private
group
comes
to
a
bookseller
and
says,
i
don't
like
it
whether
that
be
religious
group
or
any
other
group.
out
of
fear,
he
is
going
to
have
to
withdraw
it
and
there
isn't
a
reason
in
the
world
why
he
shouldn't
be
under
the
same
precious
ultimately
for
distributing
political
or
religious
matter
too.
today,
we
are
talking
about
sex
speech
which
is
unpopular.
but
the
rule
of
law
which
says
that
a
bookseller
can
be
made
a
criminal
because
he
distributes
works
that
somebody
doesn't
like
and
that
he
can
be
punished
upward
inevitably
has
a
very
high
potential
for
suppressing
speech.
and
unless
we
give
the
bookseller
the
kind
of
protection
that
has
been
talked
about
often
in
this
court,
that
a
bookseller
brought
up
on
a
criminal
prosecution,
is
ring
the
bell
with
all
of
these
great
protections,
unless
that
be
given
some
meaning
and
effect,
we're
going
to
have
a
(inaudible)
which
we
haven't
seen
since
salem
because
the
prosecutors
today,
under
the
pressure
of
private
groups,
are
really
running
rampant
and
booksellers
today
are
frightened
and
something
has
to
be
done.
and
pretty
soon,
to
give
them
the
kind
of
protection
so
that
they
will
be
able
to
stand
up
to
the
pressure,
otherwise,
as
i
say,
there
will
be
a
kind
of
erosion
of
the
first
amendment
that
we
could
not
tolerate.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it's
our
argument
that
unless
the
defend
--
a
bookseller,
who
sells
a
magazine
knows
it's
obscene,
he
cannot
be
found
guilty.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
he
didn't
read
it,
then
i
would
say
that
on
the
most
circumstances,
he
could
not
be
found
guilty.
i
think
there
might
be
a
situation
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
what
i
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
what
i
had
in
mind,
mr.
justice
black
was
a
situation,
for
example
where
there
had
been
a
civil
proceeding,
for
example,
and
which
a
state
have
had
an
adjudication
with
regard
to
a
book
and
found
that
the
book
is
obscene
and
then,
a
bookseller
is
notified
of
the
adjudication.
if
he
then
sells
the
book,
knowing
that
there
has
been
an
adjudication
finding
it
to
be
obscene,
then
he
has
the
requisite
guilty
knowledge
or
he
might
in
the
constitution.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
say
that
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
black.
our
argument
is
that,
in
the
ordinary
case,
there
may
be
unusual
ones,
but
in
the
ordinary
case,
unless
a
bookseller
knows
it,
either
by
way
of
some
prior
adjudication
or
he
may
--
there
may
be
admission
which
he
says,
"i
read
the
book
and
i
think
that
it
is
obscene."
but
in
the
ordinary
case
such
as
the
case
we
have
here,
what
do
we
have
but
a
man
who
handles
books
and
magazines?
the
magazines,
i
respectfully
submit,
simply
as
not
obscene
under
decision
of
this
and
virtually
every
appellate
court.
nevertheless,
he
is
found
guilty
of
it
had
he
read
the
magazines
even
he
still
in
my
judgment
would
have
to
be
found
by
a
jury
to
have
known
it
to
be
obscene
before
there
could
be
a
proper
conviction
so
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
my
argument
mr.
justice
black
is
this.
i
think
my
brief
has
made
it
plain
that
there
ought
not
to
be
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
--
censorship.
but
if
we're
going
to
have
censorship,
at
least
give
the
bookseller
the
protection
which
has
been
promised
to
him.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
we're
going
to
have
it,
we
should
make
it
as
limited
as
possible.
i
don't
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
an
evil,
once
it's
there,
we
may
as
well
have
it
in
its
worse
form.
it's
bad
enough
to
have
a
little
evil
without
having
a
program
going
to
foot.
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
if
we
got
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
we
have
two
--
we
have
two
problems,
mr.
justice
black.
the
first
one
is
the
one
you're
raising
in
terms
of
censorship.
and
if
we're
going
to
have
that
i
think
you're
right
that
in
a
long
run
of
expense.
it's
the
nature
of
censorship
to
just
grow
and
grow
and
grow.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
a
problem
of
due
process
and
an
individual,
a
person
who
would
perform
a
usual
function
of
society,
a
bookseller,
i'm
addressing
myself
now
to
the
due
process
argument
as
apart
from
the
first
amendment
argument
although
it
interlocks,
that
at
least
if
we're
going
to
have
book,
if
we're
going
to
have
book
censorship
don't
make
criminals
out
of
the
booksellers
at
the
same
time.
if
we're
going
to
have
censorship,
maybe
what,
your
honor,
suggested
in
the
ginzburg
case
is
to
set
up
a
bureau,
set
up
a
censor
and
say
this
is
what
we
can
do
and
this
is
what
we
can't
do
and
let's
be
open
about
it
that
we're
engaging
in
censorship
in
united
states
of
america
today,
if
that's
what
we're
going
to
do.
what
i'm
arguing
for,
though,
is
that
the
bookseller,
the
retailer,
the
wholesaler
and
the
publisher
shouldn't
be
made
criminals
in
the
process
for
doing
an
act
which
they
couldn't
possibly
know
as
a
crime
at
the
time
they
were
doing
it.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
if
you
have
an
in
rem
proceeding
in
which
there
is
a
censor
or
adjudication
of
some
kind
where
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
"this
is
what
you
cannot
sell."
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i'm
saying
that
that
is
a
certainly
preferable
to
the
procedure
we
have
now.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
i
want
to
make
it
plain
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
let
me
just
in
passing
say
that
i
find
that
intolerable
really
but
the
lesser
of
two
evils,
i
find
the
present
criminal
situation.
there
are
two
grounds
where
as
the
arkansas
type
situation
is
bad
on
only
one
ground
and
a
very
important
one.
it's
bad
because
it
brings
about
censorship
and
i
think
censorship
is
bad.
these
criminal
prosecutions
are
doubly
bad.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
on
that
premise,
i
believe
that
the
arkansas
type
situation
is
more
tolerable
but
not
good.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
on
the
clipping,
i'm
not
positive,
it's
certainly
was
done
on
the
orders
of
the
petitioner.
and,
i
believe
that
it
was
the
petitioner
who
physically
took
the
girlie
magazines
that
were
in
the
read
more
store
and
placed
them
in
a
rack
behind
the
counter
after
he
have
had
the
meeting
of
the
ministers
association.
i'd
like
to
make
it
plain
though
that
in
that
regard
that
these
were,
these
are
not
under
the
counter.
sometimes,
it's
thought
as
under
the
counter.
they
were
on
rocks,
in
view
but
what
the
effect
of
this
was
that
a
person
couldn't
go
there
and
thumb
through
it.
he
had
to
ask
some
specific
magazine
by
title.
as
mrs.
wolfen
did,
she
came
and
she
said,
i
would
like
four
magazines
and
she
gave
the
names
of
the
magazines
she
wanted.
two
of
them
were
out
of
stock,
two
of
them
she
purchased.
but
the
answer
to
your
two
questions
is,
certainly
the
petitioner
knew
that
he
had
girlie
magazines.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
there
were
30
that
were
place
there
subsequent
to
the
meeting
he
had
with
the
ministers.
but
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
that,
mr.
justice
black
because
although
we
talk
about
only
25
or
only
30
magazines,
in
the
marcus
case
where
the
police
were
after
what
they
thought
was
obscene
material,
there
were
280
publications
that
when
the
police
marched
in
there,
they
picked
up
280
different
titles
in
bantam
where
you
had
the
road
island
morality
commission,
they
had
a
list
of
106.
we
are
not
talking
about
25
or
30
magazines.
the
minute
the
censor
get
its
foot
on
the
door,
it's
2
today
and
it's
75
tomorrow
and
it's
300
before
the
end
of
the
month.
so
that
in
the
end,
if
the
bookseller
has
to
start
examining
the
material
that
the
censor
whether
he
be
a
private
or
non-private
persons
says,
watch
out,
we're
talking
about
examining
virtually
everything
that
it's
in
the
bookstore.
and
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
black,
with
regard
to
the
number
of
titles
that
were
in
the
store,
the
11,000
which
were
allotted
to
for
kentucky,
i
think
the
record
says
that
they
were
there.
it
wasn't
that
many
sale,
11,000
each
month.
they
have
some
books
that
are
there
for
a
long
period
of
time
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
and
in
the
very
nature
of
things,
the
way
the
industry
works,
each
month
the
national
distributor
send
them
a
whole
new
batch
of
books
and
magazines
and
the
old
ones
go
out
for
which
creditors
given
to
the
retailers.
so
there
is
a
great
deal
of
movement,
back
and
forth,
but
there
aren't
that
many
sales
unfortunately
in
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
say
that
that
is
the
rule
that
i
would
favor.
i
recognize,
of
course,
that's
not
the
rule
of
this
court
and
i'm
accepting
as
mr.
justice
harlan
properly
admonished
me
to
accept
the
fact
that
we
do
have
an
obscenity
law.
but
i
do
think
that
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
that
is
censorship,
surely.
a
criminal
conviction
such
as
we
had
here
of
the
petitioner
is
censorship
and
as
real
they
sensed,
as
if
we
had
the
kind
of
restraint
that
was
true
in
kingsley
or
in
the
arkansas
court.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
frankfurt
have
pointed
out
quite
correctly
in
the
kingsley
book
case
that
the
terror
that
a
bookseller
feels
for
--
out
of
fear
of
a
criminal
prosecution
can
work
a
suppression
of
material,
which
is
really
censorship,
more
lawful
than
a
prior
restraint
canon
enlarged.
that's
in
particularly
where
the
rules
are
very
lax
where
the
standards
are
of
obscenity
are
unknown
and
where
a
defendant,
a
publisher
or
a
bookseller
ends
up
without
any
real
defense.
the
kind
of
trial
that
mr.
austin
had
here
is
no
different
really
from
the
kind
of
trial
you
will
have
before
a
censorship
board.
what
is
it?
you
take
that
magazine,
you
throw
them
before
people
and
the
prosecutor
says,
"you
don't
like
them,
do
you.
you
don't
want
these
in
your
home,
do
you?
you
wouldn't
want
your
children
to
read
it!?
that's
the
kind
of
argument
you
make
to
a
censorship
board
and
it's
a
censorship
in
practice
and
in
operation
and
evidence
effect.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
that
is
not
my
position
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
like
to
state
this
first
that
if
we're
talking
about
adults
and
the
rights
of
adults
to
read,
either
the
most
obnoxious
sexual
material
or
the
most
obnoxious
political
material
or
the
most
obnoxious
religious
material,
i
believe
that
in
a
free
society
that
the
adult
must
be
permitted
to
read
it.
and
if
he's
going
to
be
permitted
to
read
it,
he
must
be
able
to
obtain
it
and
that
would
require
the
rule,
as
i
would
see
it
that
adults
should
have
the
permission
to
read
and
to
purchase
material
of
any
kind.
now,
the
suggestion
made
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
jacobellis
is
a
suggestion
which
i
think
makes
sense
and
constitutionally,
i
believe
stands
on
a
much
stronger
footing.
and
that
is,
with
regard
to
minors,
with
regard
to
persons
who
are
unable
to
make
judgments.
there
is
room,
i
think,
for
some
kind
of
an
accommodation
with
regard
to
keeping
out
of
the
hands
of
minors
in
something
like
the
same
passion
that
liquor
or
cigarettes
are
kept
from
minors.
but
when
we're
talking
about
adults,
they
are
said,
mr.
justice
black
was
correct
in
terms
of
how
old
was
the
man,
the
witness
for
the
petitioner
who
looked
at
the
material
and
he
was
saying
that
it
didn't
appeal
to
prurient
interest
and
the
like.
i
think
that
most
adults,
all
adults,
if
we're
talking
about
the
average
normal
adult
is
totally
able
to
handle
sexual
material
just
as
surely
as
he
was
able
to
handle
terrible
political
material.
it's
such
an
anomaly
to
say
that
we
can
trust
adults
in
all
these
other
areas.
but
somehow,
he
goes
to
pieces
when
he
sees
something
that
is
very
strong.
however,
you
want
to
form
it
and
talk
about
it
in
the
sexual
sense.
if
we
come
down
to
the
path
that's
really
just
like
we
get
used
to,
i
saw
on
nbc
today
on
television,
morning.
but
if
we
on
a
news,
much
more
fright,
much
more
fright
than
any
of
the
news
in
these
two
magazines.
they
were
completely
revealed
and
there
wasn't
any
feeling.
i
mean,
we
get
used
to
certain
things
one
way
or
the
other.
ten
years
ago,
we
would
have
thought
that
the
american
people
couldn't
possibly
tolerate
it.
now,
in
the
morning
show
on
today
on
nbc
in
washington,
it's
there
and
i
think
that
we
see,
for
example,
that
the
american
people
has
been
able
to
read
tropic
of
cancer,
tropic
of
capricorn
without
the
words
for
it.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
was
today?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it's
called
today
it
was
on
--
before
i
went
to
put
this
morning
and
it
was,
i
think
it
we
would
be
very
interesting
to
have
a
rerun
of
it
and
compare
it.
compare
it
with
the
pictures
here
and
i
can
only
assure
you
that
the
nudes
there
are
far
more
revealing,
far
more
seductive
than
any
of
the
pictures
in
these
magazines.
what
are
we
then
talking
about
in
terms
of
all
the
need
to
censor?
people
can
read
these
things
and
look
at
it
without
our
society
falling
of
-
-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
the
case
of
prince
against
new
hampshire,
if
my
memory
serves
me.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
believe
the
case
of
prince
against
new
hampshire,
if
my
memory
serves
right
has
drawn
a
constitutional
line
between
saying
that
children
for
example
may
not
be
as
free
to
go
on
the
streets
and
circulate
petitions
as
adults
would
be.
that
is
a
limitation
upon
an
adult
would
have
violated
the
constitution
whereas,
constitutionally
speaking,
we
said
that
it
would
be
proper
to
have
that
limitation
with
regard
to
youth.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
i,
that
i
would
be
saying
so.
yes,
that
we
could
say
that
material
which
an
adult
has
the
right
to
read
and
therefore
our
society
cannot
punish
a
person
for
making
it
available
might
nevertheless
be
punishable
if
it
is
sold
to
a
child,
and
particularly
if
it
is
sold
to
a
child
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
some
improper
conduct.
but
i
think
that
the
limitation
might
be
fairly
drawn
as
mr.
justice
brennan
had
indicated
in
jacobellis
with
a
statute
which
says,
you
cannot
sell
or
make
available
to
youth
certain
types
of
material
which
material
is
otherwise
generally
available
to
the
adult
population.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
could
not
do
it
anymore
fairly
than
in
the
prince
case
it
was
the
same
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
i
can't
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
cannot
give
you
the
answer
of
that.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
that
is
a
portion
of
the
judgment
that
a,
in
a
free
society
we
make
an
assumption
and
that
assumption
is,
that
adults
for
example,
can
do
things
that
youth
cannot
it.
if
something
like,
i
would
suspect
that
the
notion
of
voting,
you
arbitrarily
say
that
at
certain
age,
a
person
is
unable
to
vote
and
therefore,
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
franchise.
but
i
would
say
that
it
would
be.
if
you
take
the
position
that
there
can
be
no
limitation
of
any
kind,
then
we
would
have
to
say
the
same
is
true
with
regard
to
children.
i
am
taking
a
position,
some
play
short
of
that
in
terms
of
saying
that
the
limitation
has
to
be
as
narrow
as
the
requirements
that
we
feel
have
to
be
filled
are.
if
we
say
there
is
a
problem
and
the
problem
is
children,
then
a
statute,
in
order
to
be
valid
ought
to
be
as
narrow
as
the
need
so
that
we
say,
using
the
principle
that
when
we
invade
the
free
speech
area,
we
have
to
use
the
narrowest
rule
that
we
can
use.
if
we
take
that
approach,
i
would
say
this
is
a
narrower
rule
than
one
would
say
that
adults
would
have
to
be
have
a
material
beyond
their
reach
also.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
narrower
rule,
it's
the
narrowest
rule
that
one
can
draw
and
therefore
it
is
the
one
that
ought
to
be
accepted.
if
we
agree
that
the
problem
is
youth
then
that
adult
at
least
are
able
to
handle
it
then
we
should
have
a
statue
which
says
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
there
has
been
some
-
-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
has
been,
there
has
been
---
mr.
stanley
fleishman
your
honor,
it's
quite
right.
however,
on
the
same
rule
i
suppose
that
sometimes
after
considering
the
case,
this
court
has
determined
that
certiorari
has
been
improvidently
granted.
this
court
may
be
of
the
view
that
certiorari
was
improvidently
restricted
here
and
perhaps
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
that
in
this
case,
it
was
due
respect.
i
think
that
the
issues
ought
to
be
more
fully
explored.
the
instructions
were
plainly
wrong.
the
determination
of
obscenity
was
plainly
wrong.
and
i
think
that
the
discussion
we're
having
here
now
is
perhaps
whether
or
not
certiorari
on
broader
terms
ought
not
to
be
granted
with
full
argument
and
opportunity
to
respond
into,
address
himself
to
the
full
issues.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you.
