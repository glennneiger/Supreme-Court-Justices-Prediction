how
do
you

(inaudible)?
justice

(inaudible)
justice

do

also
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice

white
(inaudible)
justice

white
then
is
that
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
that's
scienter,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wouldn't
know,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
all
i
want
to
know
is
you
don't
think
that
--
you
wouldn't
--
without
the
conversation
in
here
you
would
have
no
proof
of
scienter.
i
mean
without
the
conversation
that
well
we
have
worse
book.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
nothing
but
a
sale
with
75
cents
or
$1.85
or
whatever
it
was,
no
conversation
that,
i
want
these
two
books,
here
is
the
money,
sale
completed
and
the
only
evidence
there
was
the
book
itself
plus
that
transaction,
you
wouldn't
think
that
conviction
on
the
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
area
we
heard
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
you
just
skipped
into
the
conversation
here,
the
fact
that
he
knew
what
was
in
it
by
looking
at
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there's
no
evidence
that
he
knew
what
was
in
it,
you
would
say
the
conviction
were
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
is
the
exchange
of,
“why
do
you
sell
that
stuff?”
and
he
says,
“we
have
worse
than
that.”
is
that
the
only
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nobody
has
ever
--
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
he
ever
read
the
blurb.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
don't
--
i
wouldn't
suppose
that
he
would
read
every
blurb
in
every
book
he
ever
sold.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
the
standards
should
be
either
he
knew
or
he
should
have
known?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
it
is
the
standard
under
the
new
york
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
wouldn't
suppose
the
clerk
is
negligent
or
that
he
--
that
you
can
say
a
clerk
should
know
every
word
--
every
contents
of
10,000
volumes
in
a
store,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
either
--
or
the
owner
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
my
only
question
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
my
only
question
is
why
isn't
there
enough
evidence
in
this
case
to
sustain
its
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
narrowly,
if
you
have
to
know
the
content
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you're
saying
this
is
some
evidence
and
we
couldn't
reverse
on
this
basis
as
there
being
no
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
some
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
instructions
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
practical
matter,
the
criminal
provision
never
come
into
play
in
a
magazine
case
or
ask
you,
why
can
your
injunction
ever
be
effective
in
a
magazine
case?
say
you'd
proceed
against
the
magazine
that
comes
out
every
two
weeks?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
twice
a
month,
you
can't
have
a
preliminary
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
be
at
the
magazine
until
you've
had
a
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
by
the
time
you've
had
your
trial,
that
issue
with
the
magazine
is
long
since
out
of
date
and
then
it
gets
new
ones
on
the
stand.
then
you
haven't
been
to
ban
that
magazine
on
the
stand
anyway
while
--
during
the
trial.
and
so
--
and
once
the
newer
issue
comes
out,
the
old
magazine
is
not
going
to
be
sold
again
anyway
so
you
will
never
have
an
opportunity
to
apply
your
injunction
to
the
old
issue
or
the
criminal
provision,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what's
arkansas
wasting
this
time
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
really
telling
me
--
what
you're
saying
to
the
public
here
is,
you
go
ahead
and
send
later
issues
in
here,
we'll
have
to
try
those.
and
we
can
never
apply
the
criminal
provisions
to
you
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
why
are
you
wasting
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
but
books,
it
might
be
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
have
a
--
that
has
some
kind
of
affirmative
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
in
--
in
one
specific
issue
of
the
magazine?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
assume
the
decree
but
at
this
point
you
have
to
agree
within
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
arkansas?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
assume,
the
(inaudible)
of
arkansas
through
that
--
did
the
court
--
but
the
court
just
defined
just
to
keep
the

and
enjoined
upon
showing
that
these
magazines
are
obscene,
isn't
it?
justice
byron

white
29
in
the
record?
justice
byron

white
well,
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
--
i
concede
did
not
apply
to
futuristic
--

yes.
the

advised
(inaudible)

are
not

it
does
not
enjoin

or
to

the

held
a

how

you
