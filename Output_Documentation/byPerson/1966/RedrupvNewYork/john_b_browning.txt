mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
kentucky
statute
prohibiting
the
sale
of
obscene
literature
as
an
old
one
originally
acted
--
enacted
in
its
present
form
in
1894.
but
without
any
express
requirement
of
scienter
until
the
year
1962
which
time
the
kentucky
legislature
amended
it
to
specifically
require
proof
that
the
defendant
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
or
character
of
the
material
which
he
sold.
that
kentucky
statute
with
the
scienter
requirement
placed
in
it
in
1962
has
been
construed
by
the
kentucky
courts
and
the
authoritative
construction
placed
on
it
by
the
kentucky
courts
must
be
considered
to
be
the
instructions
given
to
the
jury
by
the
mccracken
circuit
court.
sends
on
appeal
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
the
conviction
of
petitioner
was
affirmed
and
there
was
no
opinion.
there
are
highest
appellate
courts
simply
stating
that,
we
find
no
error
in
the
case.
therefore,
if
we
are
concerned
with
instruction
given
the
kentucky
statute
by
the
court
of
kentucky,
we
must
go
to
the
principle
instruction
given
to
the
jury
and
the
mccracken
circuit
court.
now,
that
principle
instruction,
number
one,
is
that
the
jury
must
believe
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
as
the
owner
and
an
operator
of
read
more
newsstand
did
on
the
28th
day
of
september
1963.
at
said
place
of
business
knowingly
have
for
sale
these
two
magazines
and
further
that
the
defendant
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
and
the
character
of
the
magazines.
i
submit
to
you
that
this
statute
in
kentucky
as
construed
by
the
kentucky
courts
and
this
principle
instruction
to
the
jury
below
required
first
that
it
be
found
by
the
jury
from
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
knew
the
magazines,
these
two
magazines
were
for
sale
at
his
store.
and
secondly,
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
magazines.
and
thirdly,
that
he
knew
the
character
in
the
magazine.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
--
but
for
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
statute
provides
that
it
is
required
to
be
proved
that
he
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
or
character.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
am
speaking
of
the
construction
authoritatively
placed
on
a
kentucky
statute
by
the
kentucky
courts.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
am
on
page
109
in
the
record
and
i
am
referring
to
the
principle
instruction
given
to
the
jury
in
the
mccracken
circuit
court.
mr.
john
b.
browning
there
was
none
whatsoever.
in
this
entire
record,
there
is
not
one
reference
of
any
sort
to
a
statutory
presumption
it
was
never
used,
it
was
never
involved
in
this
case.
the
jury
was
not
instructed
concerning
any
presumption,
counsel
did
not
say
a
word
about
it
in
the
argument
of
the
jury.
it
is
not
brought
out
or
mentioned
anywhere
in
this
record.
all
that
you
can
say
is
that
you
have
in
the
statute.
it
was
not
involved,
construed
or
applied
in
this
case.
and
i
submit
while
we
are
on
that
point
and
under
the
authority
of
united
states
versus
raines.
this
court
cannot
consider
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
a
vacuum
where
it
has
not
application
to
the
case
at
hand.
mr.
justice
stewart
have
you
found
the
instruction
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
which
i
refer.
you
will
note
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
right.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
understood
character
for
mean
the
obscene
character
of
the
material.
this
is
my
understanding.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
this
court
previously
had
required
only
knowledge
of
the
contents,
if
this
was
sufficient
on
scienter.
if
according
to
michigan,
i
am
mistaken
in
that
conclusion
that
my
personal
conclusion.
i
am
arguing
here
or
not
what
i
conceive
the
court
is
free
these
opinions
to
be.
but
what
the
lower
court
in
this
case
actually
gave
which
was
more
than
i
thought
it
was
necessary.
namely,
that
they
must
find
that
he
knew
the
magazine
where
at
his
store
that
he
knew
the
contents
and
further,
thirdly
that
he
knew
the
character
of
the
magazines.
i
construe
character,
personally
to
mean
knowledge
of
the
obscene
character.
mr.
john
b.
browning
but
what
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
does
not.
but
i
was
asked
the
question,
what
do
i
didn't
think
about
it?
mr.
john
b.
browning
of
an
obscene
or
indecent
character?
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes.
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
i
would
still
say
that
it
looks
like
it
could
be
the
obscene
or
indecent
character.
perhaps,
i
simply
don't
understand
the
question.
i'm
pointing
out
the
instruction
here
as
the
authoritative
construction
given
the
kentucky
statute
by
the
kentucky
courts
and
i
believe,
i'm
arguing
that
this
construction
meant
with
the
kentucky
statute
satisfied
smith
versus
california
and
that
it
required
all
of
these
points
on
the
issue
of
scienter.
i
will
proceed
then
to
argue
that
the
commonwealth's
evidence
in
chief
made
this
case
and
authorize
submission
of
this
to
the
jury.
and
it
was
certainly
not
submitted
on
any
statutory
presumption
but
the
commonwealth's
evidence
in
chief
made
the
cases
as
far
as
scienter
was
concerned.
it
was
shown
that
just
a
few
months
prior
to
the
particular
sale
in
question.
the
petitioner
met
with
several
ministers
representing
the
committee
on
moral
and
social
welfare
of
the
paducah
ministerial
association.
they
talked
to
him
about
obscenity
in
general
and
in
particular
about
this
particular
class
of
magazines
known
as
girlie
magazines.
they
made
known
to
him
specifically
complains
which
the
ministers
had
been
receiving
from
the
public
in
general
concerning
the
sale
of
these
magazines.
and
they
discussed
their
obscene
content
in
general
with
him.
as
a
consequence
of
this,
he
went
back
to
his
store
and
personally
collected
and
segregated
25
to
30
titles
of
girlie
magazines
and
put
him
on
the
rack
behind
the
cashier's
counter
and
he
stapled
them
to
prevent
them
from
being
leak
through.
he
put
them
back
there
expressly
because
he
considered
them
to
be
adult
reading
only
and
he
knew
thereby
that
they
had
a
prurient
interest
appeal.
this
was
sufficient
to
show
that
he
knew
or
should
have
known
the
contents
of
the
magazine.
now
what
about
this
so-called
defense
of
honest
belief
that
there
were
not
obscene?
we
contend
that
that
defense
was
actually
was
not
raised
in
this
case.
he
was
not
entitled
to
any
instructions.
i
refer
the
court
concerning
kentucky
procedure
on
instructing
juries
in
criminal
cases
to
stanley's
authoritative
three-volume
work
on
kentucky
instructions
to
juries'
volume
3
section
771
pages
15
through
18.
the
subject
to
that
section
is
special
affirmative
defenses.
now,
i
have
stated
there
that
it
is
a
matter
of
kentucky
law
if
the
negative
of
the
principle
instructions
to
the
jury
sufficiently
covers
what
the
defendant
is
raising
then
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
separate
instruction.
the
time
when
he
is
entitled
to
an
affirmative
special
defense
is
when
he
pleads
at
--
he
pleads
by
nature
of
confessions
and
avoidance.
in
other
words
he
says,
i
will
admit
to
the
many
of
the
things
that
you
charge
with
me
but
i
will
avoid
the
application
of
the
penalty
on
a
separate
defense
which
i
am
raising
here.
this
was
not
a
confession
and
avoidance
case.
the
defendant
here
did
not
testify
that
of
course
i
knew
these
magazines
were
there.
i
--
i
was
familiar
with
them
but
i
did
not
believe
that
they
were
obscene.
he
testified
that
as
to
one
magazine
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
such
a
publication.
he
never
heard
of
it,
never
knew
of
it.
how
can
a
person
in
that
situation
say
that
i
never
knew
of
the
existence
of
it
and
yet,
i
have
formed
a
reasonable
belief
that
it
was
not
obscene?
he
could
not
have,
he
did
not
say
so.
at
no
time
during
his
trial
that
he
say
that
he
had
formed
a
reasonable
belief
that
they
were
not
obscene.
his
counsel
in
arguing
the
case
for
the
jury,
there
we
should
find
the
counsel
harping
away
on
the
idea
that
this
man
reasonably
believe
and
had
a
good
faith
believe
that
--
belief
that
these
magazines
were
not
obscene.
counsel
said
only
on
page
82
of
the
record.
he
said
only
this,
“here
isn't
a
word
of
proof
in
this
case.”
mr.
austin
knew
that
these
two
magazines
were
down
there.
so
let
--
let's
face
it,
what
was
his
defense
in
this
case.
simply
that
he
did
not
know
the
magazines
were
there.
there
with
it
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
--
i
think
that
the
concept
of
--
in
the
concept
of
obscenity
it
is
implicit
that
the
material
is
without
regaining
social
importance.
mr.
john
b.
browning
this
is
my
understanding
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
--
i
certainly
don't
concede
that
they
are
erroneous.
no,
sir.
i
believe
to
find
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
cannot
recall
but
i
heard
review
of
the
instructions
again
that
this
is
in
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
alright
sir,
i'll
agree
with
you
in
it.
mr.
john
b.
browning
if
not
in
the
instructions.
but
i
don't
concede
that
that
makes
the
instructions
totally
erroneous.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
don't
concede
that
it
makes
the
instructions
erroneous,
i
disagree
with
you
there.
but
i
did
not
believe
that
certiorari
being
limited
here
embrace
the
questions
of
the
propriety
of
instructions
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
b.
browning
but
the
instructions
in
other
facets
here
were
sufficient
to
indicate
that
this
material
must
be
without
redeeming
self
importance.
mr.
john
b.
browning
let's
say
the
instructions
taken
in
the
whole
imply
that
that
if
all
these
factors
were
believed
to
be
true
about
the
magazines
they
must
be
without
reading
themselves.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
defense
here,
as
i
will
take
the
trouble
to
repeat
was
certainly
not
that
he
has
a
reasonable
belief
the
magazines
were
obscene.
the
defense
is
very
simply.
he
did
not
know
that
they
were
there.
if
we
believe
that
it
is
perfectly
true
that
he
didn't
know
it
and
certainly
should
have
known
it.
the
particular
class
of
magazines
were
complained
to
him.
his
attention
was
pointed
out
that
to
him.
his
attention
was
called
to
them.
he
personally
collected
25
or
30
of
them
he
knew
what
it
seems
a
category
of
girlie
magazines
whose
sales
should
be
limited
to
adult
and
he
put
them
on
this
counter
and
rack
behind
the
cashier's
counter.
and
if
he
says
that
he
didn't
know
they
were
there.
he
should
have
known.
there
is
no
reason
why
it
could
not
have
taken
the
trouble
to
scan
the
small
group
magazines.
to
see
for
himself
what
was
in
them
and
to
select
from
among
them
those
which
he
thought
could
be
sold
and
which
cannot
be
sold.
then
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
evidence
of
course
that
he
was
a
wholesale
news
distributor
and
that
he
first
got
the
books
as
a
wholesaler
and
then
that
he
distributed
them
to
his
read
more
news
retail
stand.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
right
he
supplied
the
books
to
himself
in
this
case.
and
as
far
as
being
able
to
keep
the
books
out
of
his
retail
stores
since
he
was
supplying
the
books
to
himself
possibly
could
have
done
that.
he
cannot
have
display
them
for
retail
sale.
mr.
john
b.
browning
he
says
that
the
in
his
read
more
news
story,
he
handled
approximately
11,000
titles
a
month,
4,000
paperback
books
paying
there
titles,
4,000
hardbound
books,
and
3,000
magazines.
mr.
john
b.
browning
in
his
wholesale
nude
distributorship.
he
had
five
different
locations.
here
in
the
city
of
paducah,
he
had
only
one
retail
new
store
and
the
magazines
of
course
were
purchased
at
this
paducah
retail
newsstand.
the
magazines
on
which
the
prosecution
was
based.
i
think
he
said
at
his
read
more
newsstand
handle
11,000
titles
each
month.
this
is
an
impressive
figure
and
he
says
that
it
tried
to
say
that
as
a
conclusion
which
could
not
be
called
for
at
which
humanly
impossible
for
anybody
to
read
what
was
in
those
11,000
titles
and
we
submit
that
he
didn't
have
to
read
everything
in
his
store.
all
in
the
world
he
had
to
do
was
to
take
the
trouble
to
scan
briefly
the
25
or
so
magazines
that
he
himself
had
put
behind
the
cash
register.
we're
not
suggesting
that
he
read
11,000
titles
and
it
wasn't
necessary
to
do
so
in
this
case.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
this
is
what
his
testimony
was.
i
thought
myself
with
that
was
quite
an
excessive
number
but
that
appears
in
the
record
as
his
statement.
he
was
asked,
“how
many
–
tell
how
many
volumes
or
how
many
different
magazines
in
a
month
you
have
at
read
more,
this
read
more
stand
you're
state
intact.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
am
reading
from
page
30.
he
was
asked,
“tell
us
how
many
volumes
or
how
many
different
magazines
in
one
month
you
handle
at
read
more.
this
is
just
at
read
more
stand.”
answer,
“you're
speaking
of
titles
mr.
williams?”
“yes,
sir.
titles.”
well,
it
buries,
i
would
say
there
is
3,000
titles
on
sale
at
all
time
of
magazines
and
approximately
4,000
titles
of
hard
books,
and
4,000
titles
of
paperback
books
in
all
about
11,000
i
would
say.
11,000
titles
that
is
one
read
more
retail
newsstand
a
month
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
will
if
i
had
time.
i
see
that
i
will
do
so.
yes,
sir.
he
first
tried
to
introduce
these
trial
six
paperback
books,
lady
chatterley's
lover
and
others.
these
matters
were
not
introduced
at
all
to
show
scienter.
they
were
introduced
as
tending
to
show
contemporary
community
standards.
the
six
paperback
books,
he
never
testified
that
he
had
read
these
books
or
was
even
familiar
with
them
in
anyways.
so
how
could
they
have
born
on
scienter?
he
offer
to
introduce
items
from
the
paducah
public
library
taken
from
museum
of
modern
art
productions
taken
from
a
book
on
greg
sculpture
and
taken
from
u.s.
camera
annual
issue
photographic
magazine.
once
again,
he
did
not
testify
that
because
these
things
showing
nude
form
when
a
paducah
public
library.
i
reasonably
believe
that
these
two
magazines
were
not
appeal.
he
didn't
say
that
at
all.
they
were
introduced
to
show
that
the
betrayal
of
the
nude
form
could
be
found
in
books
certainly
regarded
as
acceptable
in
the
paducah
public
library,
but
it
did
not
bear
on
scienter.
mr.
john
b.
browning
on
the
question,
whether
the
books
are
obscene
or
not?
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
--
well
i
would
say,
i
don't
think
he
offered
it
on
scienter
at
all.
i
think
it
was
offered
entirely
on
the
community
--
contemporary
community
standards.
they
were
not
comparable
in
material
in
any
sense.
they
were
--
they
were
certainly
far
different
from
these
magazines
here.
they
--
it
should
not
have
been
offered
an
evidence.
it
was
irrelevant
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
no,
it's
for
the
judge
to
determine
whether
the
evidence
is
admissible
or
not.
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
i'm
just
arguing
that
the
judge
was
correct
in
his
ruling
because
comparable
materials
should
at
least
be
similar
in
content
and
style
and
form
to
what
is
in
issue.
we
have
two
magazines
on
trial
here.
mr.
john
b.
browning
but
it
should
not
be
admitted,
i
submit
to
this
court.
if
it's
not
comparable
in
any
sense
in
content
or
style
or
form
to
what's
on
trial.
why
bring
in
material
that
doesn't
conform
if
not
similar
to
what
he
is
being
prosecuted
for
and
try
to
say,
look
here,
the
public
biases
been
accepted.
mr.
john
b.
browning
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
closed
yesterday,
i
was
touching
upon
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
concerning
the
exclusion
of
certain
material
offered
at
defendant's
trial
in
mccracken
circuit
court
in
this
case.
i
was
making
the
point
that
the
exhibits,
which
were
not
permitted
to
be
placed
in
evidence
by
the
trial
judge,
were
not
similar
to
the
two
magazines
spree
and
high
heels
upon
which
this
prosecution
was
based.
there
were
first
six
paperback
books.
they
were
recognized
literary
works
although
containing,
of
course,
questionable
passages.
one
of
them
was
henry
miller's
work
tropic
of
capricorn.
these
books
are
certainly
not
similar
in
any
degree
to
the
two
girlie
magazines
for
which
mr.
austin
was
being
prosecuted.
they
were
literary
works.
the
girlie
magazines
have
no
literary
value
whatever.
they
were
entirely
printed
materials
whereas
the
girlie
magazines
had
most
of
their
prurient
interest
appeal
based
on
photographs
of
nude
and
semi-nude
females.
as
to
the
material
and
the
public
library,
it
cannot
possibly
be
argued
that
because
the
nude
form
is
accepted
in
the
museum
of
modern
art
and
in
series
of
photographic
issues
and
they
invoked
some
great
sculpture
that
we
must
therefore
accept
the
same
exposure
of
the
nude
female
form
in
the
girlie
magazines
in
the
style
and
format
in
which
the
form
is
displayed
in
those
magazines.
mr.
john
b.
browning
affirmatively,
the
evidence
which
was
permitted
to
go
to
the
jury
was
the
testimony,
i
think
it's
dr.
lowry,
who
was
a
professor
of
murray
state
college.
he
was
put
on
the
stand
and
he
was
permitted
to
answer
terrible
questions,
one
of
which,
would
you
say
that
these
magazines
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
and
he
answered
that
no.
and
he
was
asked
if
the
magazines
in
his
expert
opinion
were
such
as
would
create
a
morbid
interest
or
prurient
interest
in
nudity
or
sex
in
the
average
person
and
this
was
objected
to
but
he
was
permitted
to
answer
and
he
said,
no,
quite
the
contrary.
they
would
not
stimulate
prurient
interest
in
anyone.
it
would
not
appeal
to
the
average
of
normal
adult.
mr.
john
b.
browning
dr.
lowry
was
mr.
austin,
the
defendant's
witness,
and
he
qualified
first
by
saying
that
he
talked
the
social
sciences
and
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
community
standards
and
he
had
kept
up
with
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
that
in
this
case
that
we're
concerned
with
today,
actually,
the
standards
were
considered
to
be
national.
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
on
a
national
standard.
mr.
john
b.
browning
this
is
what
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
concerned.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
believe
that
he
said
that
he
was
familiar
with
community
standards
and
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
he
is
the
head
of
the
department
of
social
science
and
a
professor
at
murray
and
--
well,
one
might
certainly
question
whether
he
was
properly
qualified
as
an
expert
here
but
i'm
saying
that
the
commonwealth,
let
this
go
in
anyway.
in
other
words,
he
was
permitted
to
testify
and
he
was
permitted
to
give
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
magazines,
in
his
expert
opinion,
were
not
obscene.
mr.
john
b.
browning
so
he
said,
he
said,
quite
the
contrary.
he
was
also
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
do
not
know
at
the
moment.
he
was
the
defendant's
witness
not
ours.
and
his
only
qualification
evidently
was
that
he
have
had
a
ph.
degree
and
that
he
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
do
not
know
well
then.
can
you
tell
me,
mr.
fleishman?
i
think
that
he
had
been
a
professor
there
at
murray
for
a
great
number
of
years,
possibly
40
years
which
would
put
him
about
60
years
old.
if
i
might
proceed
with
this,
the
expert
was
also
asked
if
these
magazines
in
any
way
exceeded
or
went
beyond
the
customary
limits
of
candor
in
the
community.
he
was
permitted
to
answer
this
and
he
said,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
no,
they
do
not
go
as
far
as
some
as,
thus
far
as
some,
which
are
generally
accepted.
and
this
evidence
went
to
the
jury.
the
defendant
himself
on
the
stand
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
compensated
for
this
appearance
or
not.
but,
i'm
simply
pointing
out
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
inquiry
that
there
was
affirmative
evidence
permitted
to
be
introduced
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
this
magazines
did
not
exceed
community
standards;
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
so-called
experts
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
sir,
that
in
the
opinion
of
a
so-called
expert,
they
were
not
obscene,
did
not
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest.
the
defendant
was
permitted
to
testify
that
he
had
sold
this
same
type
of
magazine
for
many
years.
and
he
was
then
asked
and
there
has
never
been
an
objection
as
far
as
the
community
is
concerned.
well,
unfortunately,
the
defendant
was
not
able
to
answer
that
categorically,
no.
he
said
merely
there
has
never
been
an
objection
that
we
didn't
observe
and
correct
and
adjust.
in
other
words,
he's
been
selling
this
same
type
of
magazine
but
there
had
been
objections
previously.
and
finally,
since
he
brought
it
up,
it
was
brought
out
in
1960,
about
three
years
before
this
particular
sale.
the
city
commissioners
of
the
city
of
paducah
had
come
to
him
and
objected
to
this
type
of
magazine
--
that
is
the
classic
girlie
magazines
that
he
was
distributing.
and
as
a
result
of
this
complaint
at
that
time,
he
did
was
to
get
all
the
girlie
magazines
from
a
retail
store
located
near
a
school.
this
was
not
yet
read
more
retail
newsstand
but
another
retail
store
that
he
was
supplying
in
his
capacity
as
a
wholesale
news
distributor.
so,
he
was
asked
that
question,
haven't
you
been
selling
that
same
type
of
magazine
for
years?
and
he
said,
yes,
i've
been
selling
the
same
thing
for
years.
then
they
went
ahead
with
it
and
i
said
i'm
without
objection.
this
was
to
show
that
this
type
of
magazine
had
been
generally
accepted
in
the
community.
unfortunately,
he
could
not
answer
that
by
saying
there
had
never
been
an
objection.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
to
say
that
there
had
been
an
objection.
so
this
in
itself
shows
that
this
type
of
magazine
had
not
been
accepted
by
the
community.
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
in
the
area
in
which
mr.
austin
did
business,
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
he
was
a
wholesale
news
distributor.
he
had
five
wholesale
outlets.
he
said
in
his
own
testimony
that
he
supplied
perhaps
300
different
towns.
and
i
think
the
questions
were
the
sale
of
this
material
in
the
area
in
which
he
operated,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
i
might
have
to
agree
with
you
that
perhaps
the
thrust
of
this
was
really
in
this
paducah
area
because
certainly
that's
where
his
read
more
newsstand
was
located.
that's
where
he
had
his
retail
store.
that's
where
the
citizens
came
in
and
bought
the
magazines.
but
i
think
that
it
was
not
isolated
to
paducah
because
this
gentleman
did
quite
a
large
business.
he
supplied
300
towns.
he
had
three
wholesale
outlets
in
tennessee,
one
in
carbondale,
illinois,
and
this
one
in
paducah.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
instruction
given
by
the
trial
court
to
the
jury
seems
to
have
been
on
the
basis
of
the
country
as
a
whole.
this
is
instruction
no.
5
page
110
of
your
record.
the
term
"contemporary
community
standard"
as
used
in
these
instructions
are
not
the
standard
of
a
particular
individual
group,
of
individuals,
or
locality.
but
it
is
the
standard
of
the
community,
the
contemporary
society
of
this
country
at
large
or
as
a
whole.
so
i
submit
to
you
that
by
instruction
no.
5
given
the
jury,
the
standard
used
by
the
trial
court
was
the
contemporary
society
of
this
country
at
large
or
as
a
whole.
mr.
john
b.
browning
if
the
proper
standard
really
should
be
the
local
standard,
i
should
thank
that
the
defendant
would
be
favored
by
an
instruction
such
as
this.
mr.
john
b.
browning
because
it
would
permit
the
defendant
to
escape
the
penalty
if
the
jury
should
surmise
that
although
this
material
is
not
accepted
by
our
local
people
here
in
paducah,
nevertheless,
will
have
to
let
him
go
because
it
could
be
accepted
in
the
country
as
a
whole.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
it
would
benefit
the
defendant
because
if
the
standard
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
would,
well,
i
would
if
it
was
an
error
and
i
don't
concede
that.
i
think
it
would
be
a
harmless
error
because
if
the
standards
were
confined
to
the
locality,
then
this
jury
would
say
we
know
what
it
is
in
paducah
and
we
don't
like
it.
but
if
the
standards,
if
they
were
told
of
the
standards
with
the
country
as
a
whole,
in
other
words,
it's
not
what
you
think
in
paducah
but
you
have
t
consider
what
it
is
in
new
york
and
california,
then
the
jurors
might
well
think
well
of
a
law.
although
we
don't
like
it
here,
we'll
have
to
let
him
go
because
it's
accepted
in
the
country
as
a
whole.
in
other
words,
it
would
create
additional
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
jury,
which
would
benefit
the
defendant,
that
make
it
more
difficult
to
convict
him.
mr.
john
b.
browning
this
was
my
understanding.
i
thought
the
ground
of
certiorari
was
limited
to
these
particular
questions.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i'm
not
trying
to
raise
that
actually.
mr.
john
b.
browning
you
have
already
acted.
this
court
has
--
to
limit
certiorari.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
see
no
gross
flagrant
error
in
this
case.
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
i
think
that
would
be
something
that
the
court
would
have
to
resolve
for
itself.
are
you
asking
me
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
sitting
on
a
court?
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
i
think
that
position
is
well-taken
and
i
was
just
about
to
say
it
myself.
i
didn't
expect
the
argument
on
two
or
three
points
which
have
been
raised
here
and
they
were
not
adequately
briefed
and
perhaps
i
was
not
fully
prepared.
but
i
think
that
you
are
perfectly
correct,
mr.
justice
clark
that
if
certiorari
is
to
be
extended
to
all
these
other
matters
then
we
ought
to
have
time
to
argue
it
anyway,
briefly.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
would
like
a
little
time
to
prepare
a
better
argument
perhaps,
mr.
justice
black
and
then
i'll
do
my
best
to
answer
it.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
kentucky
statute
prohibiting
the
sale
of
obscene
literature
as
an
old
one
originally
acted
--
enacted
in
its
present
form
in
1894.
but
without
any
express
requirement
of
scienter
until
the
year
1962
which
time
the
kentucky
legislature
amended
it
to
specifically
require
proof
that
the
defendant
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
or
character
of
the
material
which
he
sold.
that
kentucky
statute
with
the
scienter
requirement
placed
in
it
in
1962
has
been
construed
by
the
kentucky
courts
and
the
authoritative
construction
placed
on
it
by
the
kentucky
courts
must
be
considered
to
be
the
instructions
given
to
the
jury
by
the
mccracken
circuit
court.
sends
on
appeal
to
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
the
conviction
of
petitioner
was
affirmed
and
there
was
no
opinion.
there
are
highest
appellate
courts
simply
stating
that,
we
find
no
error
in
the
case.
therefore,
if
we
are
concerned
with
instruction
given
the
kentucky
statute
by
the
court
of
kentucky,
we
must
go
to
the
principle
instruction
given
to
the
jury
and
the
mccracken
circuit
court.
now,
that
principle
instruction,
number
one,
is
that
the
jury
must
believe
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
as
the
owner
and
an
operator
of
read
more
newsstand
did
on
the
28th
day
of
september
1963.
at
said
place
of
business
knowingly
have
for
sale
these
two
magazines
and
further
that
the
defendant
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
and
the
character
of
the
magazines.
i
submit
to
you
that
this
statute
in
kentucky
as
construed
by
the
kentucky
courts
and
this
principle
instruction
to
the
jury
below
required
first
that
it
be
found
by
the
jury
from
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
knew
the
magazines,
these
two
magazines
were
for
sale
at
his
store.
and
secondly,
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
magazines.
and
thirdly,
that
he
knew
the
character
in
the
magazine.
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
--
but
for
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
statute
provides
that
it
is
required
to
be
proved
that
he
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
or
character.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
am
speaking
of
the
construction
authoritatively
placed
on
a
kentucky
statute
by
the
kentucky
courts.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
am
on
page
109
in
the
record
and
i
am
referring
to
the
principle
instruction
given
to
the
jury
in
the
mccracken
circuit
court.
mr.
john
b.
browning
there
was
none
whatsoever.
in
this
entire
record,
there
is
not
one
reference
of
any
sort
to
a
statutory
presumption
it
was
never
used,
it
was
never
involved
in
this
case.
the
jury
was
not
instructed
concerning
any
presumption,
counsel
did
not
say
a
word
about
it
in
the
argument
of
the
jury.
it
is
not
brought
out
or
mentioned
anywhere
in
this
record.
all
that
you
can
say
is
that
you
have
in
the
statute.
it
was
not
involved,
construed
or
applied
in
this
case.
and
i
submit
while
we
are
on
that
point
and
under
the
authority
of
united
states
versus
raines.
this
court
cannot
consider
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
a
vacuum
where
it
has
not
application
to
the
case
at
hand.
mr.
justice
stewart
have
you
found
the
instruction
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
which
i
refer.
you
will
note
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
right.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
understood
character
for
mean
the
obscene
character
of
the
material.
this
is
my
understanding.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
this
court
previously
had
required
only
knowledge
of
the
contents,
if
this
was
sufficient
on
scienter.
if
according
to
michigan,
i
am
mistaken
in
that
conclusion
that
my
personal
conclusion.
i
am
arguing
here
or
not
what
i
conceive
the
court
is
free
these
opinions
to
be.
but
what
the
lower
court
in
this
case
actually
gave
which
was
more
than
i
thought
it
was
necessary.
namely,
that
they
must
find
that
he
knew
the
magazine
where
at
his
store
that
he
knew
the
contents
and
further,
thirdly
that
he
knew
the
character
of
the
magazines.
i
construe
character,
personally
to
mean
knowledge
of
the
obscene
character.
mr.
john
b.
browning
but
what
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
does
not.
but
i
was
asked
the
question,
what
do
i
didn't
think
about
it?
mr.
john
b.
browning
of
an
obscene
or
indecent
character?
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes.
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
i
would
still
say
that
it
looks
like
it
could
be
the
obscene
or
indecent
character.
perhaps,
i
simply
don't
understand
the
question.
i'm
pointing
out
the
instruction
here
as
the
authoritative
construction
given
the
kentucky
statute
by
the
kentucky
courts
and
i
believe,
i'm
arguing
that
this
construction
meant
with
the
kentucky
statute
satisfied
smith
versus
california
and
that
it
required
all
of
these
points
on
the
issue
of
scienter.
i
will
proceed
then
to
argue
that
the
commonwealth's
evidence
in
chief
made
this
case
and
authorize
submission
of
this
to
the
jury.
and
it
was
certainly
not
submitted
on
any
statutory
presumption
but
the
commonwealth's
evidence
in
chief
made
the
cases
as
far
as
scienter
was
concerned.
it
was
shown
that
just
a
few
months
prior
to
the
particular
sale
in
question.
the
petitioner
met
with
several
ministers
representing
the
committee
on
moral
and
social
welfare
of
the
paducah
ministerial
association.
they
talked
to
him
about
obscenity
in
general
and
in
particular
about
this
particular
class
of
magazines
known
as
girlie
magazines.
they
made
known
to
him
specifically
complains
which
the
ministers
had
been
receiving
from
the
public
in
general
concerning
the
sale
of
these
magazines.
and
they
discussed
their
obscene
content
in
general
with
him.
as
a
consequence
of
this,
he
went
back
to
his
store
and
personally
collected
and
segregated
25
to
30
titles
of
girlie
magazines
and
put
him
on
the
rack
behind
the
cashier's
counter
and
he
stapled
them
to
prevent
them
from
being
leak
through.
he
put
them
back
there
expressly
because
he
considered
them
to
be
adult
reading
only
and
he
knew
thereby
that
they
had
a
prurient
interest
appeal.
this
was
sufficient
to
show
that
he
knew
or
should
have
known
the
contents
of
the
magazine.
now
what
about
this
so-called
defense
of
honest
belief
that
there
were
not
obscene?
we
contend
that
that
defense
was
actually
was
not
raised
in
this
case.
he
was
not
entitled
to
any
instructions.
i
refer
the
court
concerning
kentucky
procedure
on
instructing
juries
in
criminal
cases
to
stanley's
authoritative
three-volume
work
on
kentucky
instructions
to
juries'
volume
3
section
771
pages
15
through
18.
the
subject
to
that
section
is
special
affirmative
defenses.
now,
i
have
stated
there
that
it
is
a
matter
of
kentucky
law
if
the
negative
of
the
principle
instructions
to
the
jury
sufficiently
covers
what
the
defendant
is
raising
then
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
separate
instruction.
the
time
when
he
is
entitled
to
an
affirmative
special
defense
is
when
he
pleads
at
--
he
pleads
by
nature
of
confessions
and
avoidance.
in
other
words
he
says,
i
will
admit
to
the
many
of
the
things
that
you
charge
with
me
but
i
will
avoid
the
application
of
the
penalty
on
a
separate
defense
which
i
am
raising
here.
this
was
not
a
confession
and
avoidance
case.
the
defendant
here
did
not
testify
that
of
course
i
knew
these
magazines
were
there.
i
--
i
was
familiar
with
them
but
i
did
not
believe
that
they
were
obscene.
he
testified
that
as
to
one
magazine
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
such
a
publication.
he
never
heard
of
it,
never
knew
of
it.
how
can
a
person
in
that
situation
say
that
i
never
knew
of
the
existence
of
it
and
yet,
i
have
formed
a
reasonable
belief
that
it
was
not
obscene?
he
could
not
have,
he
did
not
say
so.
at
no
time
during
his
trial
that
he
say
that
he
had
formed
a
reasonable
belief
that
they
were
not
obscene.
his
counsel
in
arguing
the
case
for
the
jury,
there
we
should
find
the
counsel
harping
away
on
the
idea
that
this
man
reasonably
believe
and
had
a
good
faith
believe
that
--
belief
that
these
magazines
were
not
obscene.
counsel
said
only
on
page
82
of
the
record.
he
said
only
this,
“here
isn't
a
word
of
proof
in
this
case.”
mr.
austin
knew
that
these
two
magazines
were
down
there.
so
let
--
let's
face
it,
what
was
his
defense
in
this
case.
simply
that
he
did
not
know
the
magazines
were
there.
there
with
it
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
--
i
think
that
the
concept
of
--
in
the
concept
of
obscenity
it
is
implicit
that
the
material
is
without
regaining
social
importance.
mr.
john
b.
browning
this
is
my
understanding
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
--
i
certainly
don't
concede
that
they
are
erroneous.
no,
sir.
i
believe
to
find
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
cannot
recall
but
i
heard
review
of
the
instructions
again
that
this
is
in
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
alright
sir,
i'll
agree
with
you
in
it.
mr.
john
b.
browning
if
not
in
the
instructions.
but
i
don't
concede
that
that
makes
the
instructions
totally
erroneous.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
don't
concede
that
it
makes
the
instructions
erroneous,
i
disagree
with
you
there.
but
i
did
not
believe
that
certiorari
being
limited
here
embrace
the
questions
of
the
propriety
of
instructions
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
b.
browning
but
the
instructions
in
other
facets
here
were
sufficient
to
indicate
that
this
material
must
be
without
redeeming
self
importance.
mr.
john
b.
browning
let's
say
the
instructions
taken
in
the
whole
imply
that
that
if
all
these
factors
were
believed
to
be
true
about
the
magazines
they
must
be
without
reading
themselves.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
defense
here,
as
i
will
take
the
trouble
to
repeat
was
certainly
not
that
he
has
a
reasonable
belief
the
magazines
were
obscene.
the
defense
is
very
simply.
he
did
not
know
that
they
were
there.
if
we
believe
that
it
is
perfectly
true
that
he
didn't
know
it
and
certainly
should
have
known
it.
the
particular
class
of
magazines
were
complained
to
him.
his
attention
was
pointed
out
that
to
him.
his
attention
was
called
to
them.
he
personally
collected
25
or
30
of
them
he
knew
what
it
seems
a
category
of
girlie
magazines
whose
sales
should
be
limited
to
adult
and
he
put
them
on
this
counter
and
rack
behind
the
cashier's
counter.
and
if
he
says
that
he
didn't
know
they
were
there.
he
should
have
known.
there
is
no
reason
why
it
could
not
have
taken
the
trouble
to
scan
the
small
group
magazines.
to
see
for
himself
what
was
in
them
and
to
select
from
among
them
those
which
he
thought
could
be
sold
and
which
cannot
be
sold.
then
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
evidence
of
course
that
he
was
a
wholesale
news
distributor
and
that
he
first
got
the
books
as
a
wholesaler
and
then
that
he
distributed
them
to
his
read
more
news
retail
stand.
mr.
john
b.
browning
that's
right
he
supplied
the
books
to
himself
in
this
case.
and
as
far
as
being
able
to
keep
the
books
out
of
his
retail
stores
since
he
was
supplying
the
books
to
himself
possibly
could
have
done
that.
he
cannot
have
display
them
for
retail
sale.
mr.
john
b.
browning
he
says
that
the
in
his
read
more
news
story,
he
handled
approximately
11,000
titles
a
month,
4,000
paperback
books
paying
there
titles,
4,000
hardbound
books,
and
3,000
magazines.
mr.
john
b.
browning
in
his
wholesale
nude
distributorship.
he
had
five
different
locations.
here
in
the
city
of
paducah,
he
had
only
one
retail
new
store
and
the
magazines
of
course
were
purchased
at
this
paducah
retail
newsstand.
the
magazines
on
which
the
prosecution
was
based.
i
think
he
said
at
his
read
more
newsstand
handle
11,000
titles
each
month.
this
is
an
impressive
figure
and
he
says
that
it
tried
to
say
that
as
a
conclusion
which
could
not
be
called
for
at
which
humanly
impossible
for
anybody
to
read
what
was
in
those
11,000
titles
and
we
submit
that
he
didn't
have
to
read
everything
in
his
store.
all
in
the
world
he
had
to
do
was
to
take
the
trouble
to
scan
briefly
the
25
or
so
magazines
that
he
himself
had
put
behind
the
cash
register.
we're
not
suggesting
that
he
read
11,000
titles
and
it
wasn't
necessary
to
do
so
in
this
case.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
this
is
what
his
testimony
was.
i
thought
myself
with
that
was
quite
an
excessive
number
but
that
appears
in
the
record
as
his
statement.
he
was
asked,
“how
many
–
tell
how
many
volumes
or
how
many
different
magazines
in
a
month
you
have
at
read
more,
this
read
more
stand
you're
state
intact.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
am
reading
from
page
30.
he
was
asked,
“tell
us
how
many
volumes
or
how
many
different
magazines
in
one
month
you
handle
at
read
more.
this
is
just
at
read
more
stand.”
answer,
“you're
speaking
of
titles
mr.
williams?”
“yes,
sir.
titles.”
well,
it
buries,
i
would
say
there
is
3,000
titles
on
sale
at
all
time
of
magazines
and
approximately
4,000
titles
of
hard
books,
and
4,000
titles
of
paperback
books
in
all
about
11,000
i
would
say.
11,000
titles
that
is
one
read
more
retail
newsstand
a
month
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
will
if
i
had
time.
i
see
that
i
will
do
so.
yes,
sir.
he
first
tried
to
introduce
these
trial
six
paperback
books,
lady
chatterley's
lover
and
others.
these
matters
were
not
introduced
at
all
to
show
scienter.
they
were
introduced
as
tending
to
show
contemporary
community
standards.
the
six
paperback
books,
he
never
testified
that
he
had
read
these
books
or
was
even
familiar
with
them
in
anyways.
so
how
could
they
have
born
on
scienter?
he
offer
to
introduce
items
from
the
paducah
public
library
taken
from
museum
of
modern
art
productions
taken
from
a
book
on
greg
sculpture
and
taken
from
u.s.
camera
annual
issue
photographic
magazine.
once
again,
he
did
not
testify
that
because
these
things
showing
nude
form
when
a
paducah
public
library.
i
reasonably
believe
that
these
two
magazines
were
not
appeal.
he
didn't
say
that
at
all.
they
were
introduced
to
show
that
the
betrayal
of
the
nude
form
could
be
found
in
books
certainly
regarded
as
acceptable
in
the
paducah
public
library,
but
it
did
not
bear
on
scienter.
mr.
john
b.
browning
on
the
question,
whether
the
books
are
obscene
or
not?
mr.
john
b.
browning
it
--
well
i
would
say,
i
don't
think
he
offered
it
on
scienter
at
all.
i
think
it
was
offered
entirely
on
the
community
--
contemporary
community
standards.
they
were
not
comparable
in
material
in
any
sense.
they
were
--
they
were
certainly
far
different
from
these
magazines
here.
they
--
it
should
not
have
been
offered
an
evidence.
it
was
irrelevant
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
no,
it's
for
the
judge
to
determine
whether
the
evidence
is
admissible
or
not.
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
i'm
just
arguing
that
the
judge
was
correct
in
his
ruling
because
comparable
materials
should
at
least
be
similar
in
content
and
style
and
form
to
what
is
in
issue.
we
have
two
magazines
on
trial
here.
mr.
john
b.
browning
but
it
should
not
be
admitted,
i
submit
to
this
court.
if
it's
not
comparable
in
any
sense
in
content
or
style
or
form
to
what's
on
trial.
why
bring
in
material
that
doesn't
conform
if
not
similar
to
what
he
is
being
prosecuted
for
and
try
to
say,
look
here,
the
public
biases
been
accepted.
mr.
john
b.
browning
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
--
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
closed
yesterday,
i
was
touching
upon
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
concerning
the
exclusion
of
certain
material
offered
at
defendant's
trial
in
mccracken
circuit
court
in
this
case.
i
was
making
the
point
that
the
exhibits,
which
were
not
permitted
to
be
placed
in
evidence
by
the
trial
judge,
were
not
similar
to
the
two
magazines
spree
and
high
heels
upon
which
this
prosecution
was
based.
there
were
first
six
paperback
books.
they
were
recognized
literary
works
although
containing,
of
course,
questionable
passages.
one
of
them
was
henry
miller's
work
tropic
of
capricorn.
these
books
are
certainly
not
similar
in
any
degree
to
the
two
girlie
magazines
for
which
mr.
austin
was
being
prosecuted.
they
were
literary
works.
the
girlie
magazines
have
no
literary
value
whatever.
they
were
entirely
printed
materials
whereas
the
girlie
magazines
had
most
of
their
prurient
interest
appeal
based
on
photographs
of
nude
and
semi-nude
females.
as
to
the
material
and
the
public
library,
it
cannot
possibly
be
argued
that
because
the
nude
form
is
accepted
in
the
museum
of
modern
art
and
in
series
of
photographic
issues
and
they
invoked
some
great
sculpture
that
we
must
therefore
accept
the
same
exposure
of
the
nude
female
form
in
the
girlie
magazines
in
the
style
and
format
in
which
the
form
is
displayed
in
those
magazines.
mr.
john
b.
browning
affirmatively,
the
evidence
which
was
permitted
to
go
to
the
jury
was
the
testimony,
i
think
it's
dr.
lowry,
who
was
a
professor
of
murray
state
college.
he
was
put
on
the
stand
and
he
was
permitted
to
answer
terrible
questions,
one
of
which,
would
you
say
that
these
magazines
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
and
he
answered
that
no.
and
he
was
asked
if
the
magazines
in
his
expert
opinion
were
such
as
would
create
a
morbid
interest
or
prurient
interest
in
nudity
or
sex
in
the
average
person
and
this
was
objected
to
but
he
was
permitted
to
answer
and
he
said,
no,
quite
the
contrary.
they
would
not
stimulate
prurient
interest
in
anyone.
it
would
not
appeal
to
the
average
of
normal
adult.
mr.
john
b.
browning
dr.
lowry
was
mr.
austin,
the
defendant's
witness,
and
he
qualified
first
by
saying
that
he
talked
the
social
sciences
and
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
community
standards
and
he
had
kept
up
with
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
that
in
this
case
that
we're
concerned
with
today,
actually,
the
standards
were
considered
to
be
national.
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
on
a
national
standard.
mr.
john
b.
browning
this
is
what
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
concerned.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
believe
that
he
said
that
he
was
familiar
with
community
standards
and
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
he
is
the
head
of
the
department
of
social
science
and
a
professor
at
murray
and
--
well,
one
might
certainly
question
whether
he
was
properly
qualified
as
an
expert
here
but
i'm
saying
that
the
commonwealth,
let
this
go
in
anyway.
in
other
words,
he
was
permitted
to
testify
and
he
was
permitted
to
give
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
magazines,
in
his
expert
opinion,
were
not
obscene.
mr.
john
b.
browning
so
he
said,
he
said,
quite
the
contrary.
he
was
also
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
do
not
know
at
the
moment.
he
was
the
defendant's
witness
not
ours.
and
his
only
qualification
evidently
was
that
he
have
had
a
ph.
degree
and
that
he
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
do
not
know
well
then.
can
you
tell
me,
mr.
fleishman?
i
think
that
he
had
been
a
professor
there
at
murray
for
a
great
number
of
years,
possibly
40
years
which
would
put
him
about
60
years
old.
if
i
might
proceed
with
this,
the
expert
was
also
asked
if
these
magazines
in
any
way
exceeded
or
went
beyond
the
customary
limits
of
candor
in
the
community.
he
was
permitted
to
answer
this
and
he
said,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
no,
they
do
not
go
as
far
as
some
as,
thus
far
as
some,
which
are
generally
accepted.
and
this
evidence
went
to
the
jury.
the
defendant
himself
on
the
stand
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
compensated
for
this
appearance
or
not.
but,
i'm
simply
pointing
out
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
inquiry
that
there
was
affirmative
evidence
permitted
to
be
introduced
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
this
magazines
did
not
exceed
community
standards;
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
so-called
experts
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
yes,
sir,
that
in
the
opinion
of
a
so-called
expert,
they
were
not
obscene,
did
not
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest.
the
defendant
was
permitted
to
testify
that
he
had
sold
this
same
type
of
magazine
for
many
years.
and
he
was
then
asked
and
there
has
never
been
an
objection
as
far
as
the
community
is
concerned.
well,
unfortunately,
the
defendant
was
not
able
to
answer
that
categorically,
no.
he
said
merely
there
has
never
been
an
objection
that
we
didn't
observe
and
correct
and
adjust.
in
other
words,
he's
been
selling
this
same
type
of
magazine
but
there
had
been
objections
previously.
and
finally,
since
he
brought
it
up,
it
was
brought
out
in
1960,
about
three
years
before
this
particular
sale.
the
city
commissioners
of
the
city
of
paducah
had
come
to
him
and
objected
to
this
type
of
magazine
--
that
is
the
classic
girlie
magazines
that
he
was
distributing.
and
as
a
result
of
this
complaint
at
that
time,
he
did
was
to
get
all
the
girlie
magazines
from
a
retail
store
located
near
a
school.
this
was
not
yet
read
more
retail
newsstand
but
another
retail
store
that
he
was
supplying
in
his
capacity
as
a
wholesale
news
distributor.
so,
he
was
asked
that
question,
haven't
you
been
selling
that
same
type
of
magazine
for
years?
and
he
said,
yes,
i've
been
selling
the
same
thing
for
years.
then
they
went
ahead
with
it
and
i
said
i'm
without
objection.
this
was
to
show
that
this
type
of
magazine
had
been
generally
accepted
in
the
community.
unfortunately,
he
could
not
answer
that
by
saying
there
had
never
been
an
objection.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
to
say
that
there
had
been
an
objection.
so
this
in
itself
shows
that
this
type
of
magazine
had
not
been
accepted
by
the
community.
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
in
the
area
in
which
mr.
austin
did
business,
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
he
was
a
wholesale
news
distributor.
he
had
five
wholesale
outlets.
he
said
in
his
own
testimony
that
he
supplied
perhaps
300
different
towns.
and
i
think
the
questions
were
the
sale
of
this
material
in
the
area
in
which
he
operated,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
i
might
have
to
agree
with
you
that
perhaps
the
thrust
of
this
was
really
in
this
paducah
area
because
certainly
that's
where
his
read
more
newsstand
was
located.
that's
where
he
had
his
retail
store.
that's
where
the
citizens
came
in
and
bought
the
magazines.
but
i
think
that
it
was
not
isolated
to
paducah
because
this
gentleman
did
quite
a
large
business.
he
supplied
300
towns.
he
had
three
wholesale
outlets
in
tennessee,
one
in
carbondale,
illinois,
and
this
one
in
paducah.
mr.
john
b.
browning
the
instruction
given
by
the
trial
court
to
the
jury
seems
to
have
been
on
the
basis
of
the
country
as
a
whole.
this
is
instruction
no.
5
page
110
of
your
record.
the
term
"contemporary
community
standard"
as
used
in
these
instructions
are
not
the
standard
of
a
particular
individual
group,
of
individuals,
or
locality.
but
it
is
the
standard
of
the
community,
the
contemporary
society
of
this
country
at
large
or
as
a
whole.
so
i
submit
to
you
that
by
instruction
no.
5
given
the
jury,
the
standard
used
by
the
trial
court
was
the
contemporary
society
of
this
country
at
large
or
as
a
whole.
mr.
john
b.
browning
if
the
proper
standard
really
should
be
the
local
standard,
i
should
thank
that
the
defendant
would
be
favored
by
an
instruction
such
as
this.
mr.
john
b.
browning
because
it
would
permit
the
defendant
to
escape
the
penalty
if
the
jury
should
surmise
that
although
this
material
is
not
accepted
by
our
local
people
here
in
paducah,
nevertheless,
will
have
to
let
him
go
because
it
could
be
accepted
in
the
country
as
a
whole.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
think
it
would
benefit
the
defendant
because
if
the
standard
--
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
would,
well,
i
would
if
it
was
an
error
and
i
don't
concede
that.
i
think
it
would
be
a
harmless
error
because
if
the
standards
were
confined
to
the
locality,
then
this
jury
would
say
we
know
what
it
is
in
paducah
and
we
don't
like
it.
but
if
the
standards,
if
they
were
told
of
the
standards
with
the
country
as
a
whole,
in
other
words,
it's
not
what
you
think
in
paducah
but
you
have
t
consider
what
it
is
in
new
york
and
california,
then
the
jurors
might
well
think
well
of
a
law.
although
we
don't
like
it
here,
we'll
have
to
let
him
go
because
it's
accepted
in
the
country
as
a
whole.
in
other
words,
it
would
create
additional
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
jury,
which
would
benefit
the
defendant,
that
make
it
more
difficult
to
convict
him.
mr.
john
b.
browning
this
was
my
understanding.
i
thought
the
ground
of
certiorari
was
limited
to
these
particular
questions.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i'm
not
trying
to
raise
that
actually.
mr.
john
b.
browning
you
have
already
acted.
this
court
has
--
to
limit
certiorari.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
see
no
gross
flagrant
error
in
this
case.
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
i
think
that
would
be
something
that
the
court
would
have
to
resolve
for
itself.
are
you
asking
me
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
sitting
on
a
court?
mr.
john
b.
browning
well,
i
think
that
position
is
well-taken
and
i
was
just
about
to
say
it
myself.
i
didn't
expect
the
argument
on
two
or
three
points
which
have
been
raised
here
and
they
were
not
adequately
briefed
and
perhaps
i
was
not
fully
prepared.
but
i
think
that
you
are
perfectly
correct,
mr.
justice
clark
that
if
certiorari
is
to
be
extended
to
all
these
other
matters
then
we
ought
to
have
time
to
argue
it
anyway,
briefly.
mr.
john
b.
browning
i
would
like
a
little
time
to
prepare
a
better
argument
perhaps,
mr.
justice
black
and
then
i'll
do
my
best
to
answer
it.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
