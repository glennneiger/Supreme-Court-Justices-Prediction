justice
abe
fortas
that
part
it
didn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it
doesn't
say
that,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
as
compared
with
what
follows
in
the
instruction.
i
didn't
say
the
jury
might
have
found
--
might
have
thought
that
mr.
austin
thought
that
these
were
purely
magazines
and
that
so
far
would
be
a
defined
as
to
character
of
the
magazines.
but
that's
quite
different
from
the
instructions
with
the
effects
of
the
theory
of
the
jury
itself.
because
the
jury
itself
in
the
next
succeeding
phrase
was
defining
that
the
magazines
or
either
of
them
are
obscene
and
of
an
indecent
character.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
jury
which
the
jury
defined.
the
jury
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
has
that
to
ask
what
then
follow
if
they
so
understood
the
instruction
to
--
for
them
to
ascertain
from
the
knowledge
of
the
character
of
magazine?
justice
abe
fortas
the
new
york
statute
does
not
expressly
require
scienter,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i
meant
--
understood
is
getting
your
submission
to
us
that
they
appear
submission
as
a
constitutional
they
have
a
statute
and
it
has
to
be
read,
so
as
to
require
scienter.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
--
when
you
read
the
statute
that
way
and
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
you
find
that
there's
no
evidence
of
scienter.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you,
about
another
phase
of
this
case.
and
my
question
relates
to
the
possibility
that
has
occurred
there
may
be
a
difference
here
between
scienter
and
mens
rea
and
that
perhaps
that
difference
could
be
fruitfully
explored.
now,
in
this
case
the
petitioner
was
a
clerk.
and
the
policeman
came
up
as
i
remembered
the
record
and
saw
these
two
books
on
the
shelf
and
he
picked
them
out
and
handed
the
clerk
the
money
and
the
clerk
wrapped
them
up
and
according
to
the
observer's
conversation
showing
the
record
which
i
take
it
the
petitioner
denies.
justice
abe
fortas
he
did
not
deny.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
well
then
in
the
event
if
you
start
thinking
about
this
case
in
terms
of
mens
rea,
perhaps
it
is
somewhat
impressive
that
the
policeman
selected
the
books
that
the
petitioner
was
a
clerk
he
did
not
place,
there's
no
evidence
that
he
was
responsible
for
displaying
these
books.
that
he
made
no
effort
to
persuade
the
policeman
to
take
these
books.
he
did
not
push
the
books
on
them,
he
did
not
suggest
the
books,
he
did
not
advertise
the
books,
and
he
did
not
place
the
books
on
the
rack.
now,
if
you
start
thinking
about
that
kind
of
a
situation
and
conventional
criminal
law
terms
then
you
get
a
kind
of
an
attenuated
mens
rea,
don't
you?
that
is
to
say
attenuated
in
the
sense
the
ancient
maxim
he
done
it,
didn't
he?
i
mean
to
say
he
sold
the
books
but
it
was
not
--
there's
no
indication
whatever
in
this
record
that
he
had
any
intent
to
purvey
or
to
promote
the
sale
of
this
particular
books
rather
than
other
books
using
the
phrase
or
the
word
in
ginzburg
there's
nothing
like
candor
that
is
involved
here.
if
there
is
mens
rea
it
is
a
very
attenuated
sort
of
mens
rea.
now,
if
you
take
that
line
of
approach
to
this
perhaps
you
get
a
different
view
of
what
scienter
means
as
applied
in
this
vexatious
field
or
perhaps
you
get
away
from
the
scienter
entirely
and
pursue
to
see
what
kind
of
trouble
you'll
get
into
using
the
phrase.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you'd
care
to
comment
on
that
i'd
be
most
grateful.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
obscenity
does
have
some
--
this
whole
field
has
something
to
do
with
the
first
amendment,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
question
is
-–
and
your
question
is
rather
there
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
theory
the
first
amendment
carves
out,
excepts,
eliminates,
and
make
some
exception
through
its
words
of
the
entire
feel
about
obscenity
whatever
that
may
mean.
justice
abe
fortas
or
whether
the
first
--
or
whether
the
only
permissible
exception
that
the
first
amendment
may
be
the
conduct
of
individuals
--
criminal
conduct.
in
fact
it
has
been
indicated
and
some
of
the
concurrences
and
the
sense
in
this
court.
i
believe
there's
something
to
that
effect
in
one
of
the
concurring
opinions
in
smith
against
california.
justice
abe
fortas
specific
intent.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
you
use
the
standard
of
specific
intent
here
as
we're
discussing
i
would
think
pretty
clearly
it
follows
that
that
is
not
present
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
except
you've
got
an
illustration
of
that,
the
opposite
thing
right
here
and
if
i'm
correct,
i
remember
people
against
finkelstein
and
they
also
have
many
case
in
minesotta.
the
clerk
--
justice
abe
fortas
with
the
products
in
the
criminal
process
because
a
policeman
comes
to
a
rack
and
picks
up
two
books,
hands
the
clerk
the
money.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
its
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
a
little
too
late
to
say
that
isn't
after
smith
against
california
when
which
ever
one
of
the
opinions
one
reads
or
the
one
reads
justice
harlan's
opinion.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
saying
about
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
other
case.
justice
abe
fortas
no.
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
the
manual
enterprises
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
that
it
says
it's
too
late
to
say
that
at
the
manual
enterprises
where
you'll
need
justice
harlan's
opinion
or
the
opinion
of
justice
brennan.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
too
late
to
say
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
show
that
thing
--
book
appeals
prurient
interest
and
from
that
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
don't
--
i
am
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
there
is
some
other
evidence
in
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
there
another
approach
to
it
and
that
is,
without
trying
to
answer
the
very
difficult
question
of
what
he
knew
or
he
believed
as
indicated
by
ginzburg
as
i
read
it,
that
the
man
promoted
that
what
he
sold,
that
he
tried
to
get
people
to
buy
it
on
his
representation
that
it
would
appeal
to
prurient
interest
or
whatever
more
suitable
words
might
be
so
that
you
don't
get
in
--
on
that
basis
perhaps
you
don't
get
into
the
refined
semantics
of
scienter,
may
be
getting
to
some
other
refined
semantics.
but
in
any
event
you
don't
get
into
those
particulars.
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
suggest
--
excuse
me,
but
i
didn't
suggest
eliminating
it,
i
suggested
the
possibility
that
when
you
start
using
as
your
instrument
for
a
decision,
not
the
legal
concept
of
scienter
but
the
legal
concept
of
specific
intent,
perhaps
then
the
role
played
by
the
concept
of
the
scienter
becomes
diluted
and
therefore
perhaps
the
necessity
for
a
precise
definition,
a
meticulous
finding
and
it
even
comes
less
appealable.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
that
make
it
unconstitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i,
may
i
put
it
this
way.
permit
me.
if
the
position
is
of
the
first
amendment
prohibits
the
sort
of
restraint
with
respect
to
adults,
it
started
with
that
proposition,
how
do
you
reach
with
both
hands
seems
to
be
a
qualification
of
it
and
say
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
prohibit
the
restraint
with
respect
to
children?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
redfield
--
justice
abe
fortas
from
this
entire
branch
of
your
argument,
that
is
to
say
the
extra
territorial
effect
on
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
statute
and
the
order.
i
would
be
grateful
if
you
would
explain
that
if
any
effect
the
general
appearance
of
your
clients
in
the
proceedings
below
may
have
had
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
because
i
understand
that
they
did
enter
a
general
appearance
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
obviously,
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
waiver?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
they
have
taken
on
the
grounds
of
--
in
part
on
the
grounds
of
extra
territorial
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you
--
it's
your
position
i
take
it,
i
don't
remember
that
it
was
briefed
by
you
at
the
--
i
thought
you
did
brief
it.
i
think
that
if
--
since
your
position
that
the
general
appearance
below,
without
any
reservation
or
any
qualification
did
not
constitute
a
submission
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
for
purposes
of
the
application
of
the
statute
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
applied?
justice
abe
fortas
that
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
supposed
a
new
york
publisher
sent
agents
down
into
arkansas
and
those
agents
open
up
a
newsstand
so
that
this
would
be
the
publisher
operating
directly
in
arkansas,
selling
this.
now
you
wouldn't
have
any
doubt
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arkansas
legislature
in
the
courts
there
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
--
but
the
theory
of
this
statute
that
the
jurisdiction
of
arkansas
attaches
here
because
of
--
acts
done
by
the
publisher
within
the
state
of
arkansas.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
statute
talks
in
terms
of
sending
across
and
to
be
sent
or
bringing
or
coursing
to
be
brought
into
the
state
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
allegedly
offending
material.
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
shows
the
mechanics,
what
happened
here
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
so
when
the
publishers
appear,
made
a
general
appearance
below,
did
they
make
this
point,
reserved
a
point,
offer
any
evidence
on
the
jurisdictional
point?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
there
was
general
submission
of
the
jurisdiction
in
the
court?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there's
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
no
point
was
made
out
of
the
theory
--
no
point
was
made
to
the
effect
that
these
publishers
are
not
found
or
doing
visits
in
the
state
of
arkansas?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
bringing
that
--
making
that
point
here
for
the
first
time?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
--
and
haply
it
does
bother
me,
i
wish
it
didn't
bother
me.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
is
kind
of
a
different
scienter
or
mens
rea
set
up
here,
first,
you
have
a
civil
proceeding,
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you
have
here,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
that
civil
proceeding,
as
i
am
dispended
as
applied
to
these
publications
which
are
mailable
and
non-mailable.
justice
abe
fortas
as
applied
to
these
publications
all
that
the
state
had
to
be
--
had
to
show
was
that
they
are
both
obscene
from
the
roth
test
or
--
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
once
that
was
shown,
then
the
judicial
determination
had
been
made.
it
doesn't
have
to
--
you
don't
have
to
show
any
intent
or
any
pandering
or
any
knowledge
of
content
or
knowledge
that
the
magazines
were
obscene.
isn't
that
correct
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
wait
a
minute.
let's
take
a
look
at
that.
will
you
give
me
that
exact
language?
only
has
--
it
says
that
every
person
whom
with
knowledge
of
its
current
offense
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
--
where
are
you,
what
page?
justice
abe
fortas
before
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
applies
to
proceedings
after
this
judicial
finding,
after
the
kind
of
proceeding
we
have
here.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
or
it
could
be
proven
but
there's
no
requirement.
justice
abe
fortas
we
have
to
do
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
show
that
the
publisher
for
example
of
gent
or
one
of
these
magazines
had
knowledge
of
its
contents,
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
i
assume
that
it
follows
that
somebody
who
publishes
a
magazine
is
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
its
contents,
or
do
you
construe
the
statute
as
requiring
something
beyond
that?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
we're
talking
here
about
publishers.
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
show
that
he
published
some
magazine.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
tell
you,
you
have
to
show
--
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
no
scienter
in
there
part
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
wait
a
minute
mr.
jackson,
i'm
sorry
to
take
your
time
but
you're
going
to
have
to
play
it
easy
and
help
me
on
this
thing.
the
--
this
proceeding,
that
we're
concerned
here
was
brought
and
could
be
brought
under
the
statute
just
on
the
basis
of
a
reasonable
belief
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
that
each
of
these
publishers
with
knowledge
of
the
contents
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
instrumental
in
send
--
shipping
the
magazine
into
the
state
and
that
the
magazine
is
obscene,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
way
the
action
was
commenced?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
what
results
is
a
judgment
as
it
did
in
this
case
requiring
that
the
issues
of
the
magazine
be
destroyed,
impounded,
etcetera,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
was
done
here
was
that
the
magazine
--
the
issues
of
the
magazine
were
to
be
destroyed.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
that's
phase
one,
that's
what
we
have
here
and
all
of
the
scienter
that's
involved
here
is
that
publishing
magazine,
therefore
he
has
knowledge
of
the
contents.
justice
abe
fortas
and
no
requirement
of
men
rea
either
beyond
what
we've
said.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand.
i'm
talking
to
you
if
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
i
may
about
this
phase
one
which
is
all
we
have
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
only
have
before
us
is
a
proceeding
and
which
says,
“no
requirement
of
scienter
or
mens
rea.”
justice
abe
fortas
now
somebody
violates
the
order
or
somebody
brings
in
to
the
state
and
let's
suppose
one
of
these
publishers,
despite
the
order
that
has
been
entered
in
the
proceeding
before
it,
sends
in
to
the
state
some
copies
of
the
particular
issue
of
the
magazine
that
has
been
condemned.
then
he
have
subject
to
criminal
prosecution,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
had
knowledge,
he
was
(voice
overlap)
and
since
he
had
knowledge
and
he
said,
“nevertheless,
the
copy
of
the
issue,
the
magazine
into
the
state.”
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
prosecuting
attorney
presumably
would
proceed
under
--
justice
abe
fortas
41-2716
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
the
number
here.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
under
that
provision,
is
there
any
requirement
of
a
specific
intent
scienter,
mens
rea
in
the
sense
that
publisher
brought
it
in
with
the
intent
of
selling,
distributing
something
knowing
it
to
be
obscene
and
with
the
purpose
of
capitalizing
on
its
quality
as
obscene
literature,
it's
a
very
rough
statement
of
what
a
--
well,
summed
up
by
--
what
i
sum
up
by
the
phrase
specific
intent.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
such
requirement
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
it
correct
that
under
41-2716,
the
prosecuting
attorney
would
bring
a
criminal
proceeding
against
the
publisher
in
the
keys
that
i
put
to?
all
he
would
have
to
show
is
that
the
publisher
has
sent
the
magazine
into
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
it's
--
the
magazines
being
sold
and
that
the
magazine,
the
issue
of
the
magazine
was
judicially
found
to
be
obscene
and
he's
made
his
case,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
we
agreed
on
that
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
do
you
think
that
this
is
any
different,
knowledge
of
its
contents
mean
something
different
in
2716
than
it
does
in
2717?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
let's
take
that
very
carefully
if
you
don't
mind.
in
2716,
which
is
this
proceeding,
the
civil
proceeding,
the
prosecuting
attorney
brings
the
case
on.
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
show
it
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
knowledge
of
contents
is
to
show
that
such
and
such
a
person
or
a
company
published
this
magazine.
that
satisfies
knowledge
of
contents
for
purposes
of
the
civil
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
subsequently,
after
--
this
--
that
a
civil
order
has
been
entered,
the
prosecuting
attorney
brings
a
criminal
proceeding,
are
you
telling
us
and
if
so,
what's
the
basis
of
it,
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
order
to
satisfy
that
same
requirement
mainly
with
knowledge
of
its
contents,
has
to
prove
something
else.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
what
i'm
going
to
ask
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
all
that.
here,
we
have
in
these
cases,
we
have
mailable
matter.
we
have
a
judicial
determination
in
the
proceeding
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
and
therefore,
we
have
knowledge
of
the
judicial
determination
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
case
that
i
have
put.
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
whether
it's
your
submission
to
this
court
that
the
prosecution
has
got
to
prove
anything
additionally
to
show
that
the
defendant
in
this
phase
number
two
proceeding
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
magazine.
justice
abe
fortas
of
what
kind?
that's
what
i'm
asking.
remember,
we're
talking
about
the
publisher.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
is
--
is
that
the
kind
of
showing
--
and
that's
the
kind
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
my
point
is
that
neither
phase
number
one
nor
phase
number
two,
if
i
correctly
understand
the
statute
in
your
explanation,
is
there
any
requirement
that
the
prosecution
proves
specific
intent
and
the
question
that
we
have
before
us
and
i
think
further
to
the
question
that
we
have
before
us
maybe,
whether
in
view
of
the
lack
of
necessity
in
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
showing
of
specific
intent
or
scienter
beyond
the
point
that
you
have
described?
and
either
phase
one
or
phase
two,
whether
in
view
of
that
fact,
phase
one,
the
phase
one
order,
is
constitutionally
defective.
justice
abe
fortas
you
and
i
know
that
there
are
lots
of
kinds
of
these
in
qualities
in
mens
rea
and
scienter
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
we're
talking
about
two
kinds
here.
i'm
talking
about
what
the
sort
refer
to
as
specific
intent
and
you're
referring
it
to
the
knowledge
of
the
contents,
etcetera.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
we
have
before
us
a
section
of
the
statute
dealing
with
non-mailable
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
i
said,
do
we
have
that,
the
court
determination?
aren't
all
of
these
magazines
mailable
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
statute
is
much
--
what
shall
i
say,
much
more
rugged
with
respect
to
non-mailable
matter
--
justice
abe
fortas
apparently
on
the
theory
that
you've
just
stated,
namely
that
the
matter
is
non-mailable,
it
does
not
have
the
advantage,
protection
or
sanctification
of
the
post
office
department
action
and
giving
it
a
second
--
allowing
it
the
exercise
second
class
privileges.
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
under
this
order
to
consider
subsequent
issues
in
the
magazines
so
that
they
can
go
ahead
and
have
what
presumably
would
be
a
very
snappy
procedure
with
respect
to
subsequent
issues,
when
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
--
that
same
(inaudible)
that
they
bring
to
the
court.
one
issue
--
one
of
these
issues
after
another
and
you
get
an
order,
isn't
that
the
way
it
works
without
the
time-consuming
process
of
service
and
the
usual
things
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
then
initiation
of
litigation.
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
complaint
they
answered
it,
i
assume.
justice
abe
fortas
you'd
have
to
do
a
set
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
effect,
what's
happening
here
is
that
the
court
refrains
jurisdiction
and
persona
--
and
these
defendants
render
in
the
days
so
far
as
appears
here,
so
long
as
they
have
magazines
appearing
on
the
stands
in
arkansas
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
don't
mind,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question.
i'm
concerned
here,
the
--
by
this
point,
if
i
correctly
understand
it.
the
standard
applied,
the
community
standard
applied
was
set
at
the
time
--
the
law
of
arkansas?
justice
abe
fortas
the
order,
as
entered
prohibit
it,
i
think
the
sale
of
these
magazines
anywhere
in
the
state,
in
other
words,
the
standard
applied
was
pine
bluff,
the
order
operates
statewide,
am
i
wrong
with
that
there?
justice
abe
fortas
the
order
applies
only
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
mean
another
action,
you
mean
another
hearing
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
same
action.
justice
abe
fortas
that
part
it
didn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it
doesn't
say
that,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
as
compared
with
what
follows
in
the
instruction.
i
didn't
say
the
jury
might
have
found
--
might
have
thought
that
mr.
austin
thought
that
these
were
purely
magazines
and
that
so
far
would
be
a
defined
as
to
character
of
the
magazines.
but
that's
quite
different
from
the
instructions
with
the
effects
of
the
theory
of
the
jury
itself.
because
the
jury
itself
in
the
next
succeeding
phrase
was
defining
that
the
magazines
or
either
of
them
are
obscene
and
of
an
indecent
character.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
jury
which
the
jury
defined.
the
jury
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
has
that
to
ask
what
then
follow
if
they
so
understood
the
instruction
to
--
for
them
to
ascertain
from
the
knowledge
of
the
character
of
magazine?
justice
abe
fortas
the
new
york
statute
does
not
expressly
require
scienter,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i
meant
--
understood
is
getting
your
submission
to
us
that
they
appear
submission
as
a
constitutional
they
have
a
statute
and
it
has
to
be
read,
so
as
to
require
scienter.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
--
when
you
read
the
statute
that
way
and
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
you
find
that
there's
no
evidence
of
scienter.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you,
about
another
phase
of
this
case.
and
my
question
relates
to
the
possibility
that
has
occurred
there
may
be
a
difference
here
between
scienter
and
mens
rea
and
that
perhaps
that
difference
could
be
fruitfully
explored.
now,
in
this
case
the
petitioner
was
a
clerk.
and
the
policeman
came
up
as
i
remembered
the
record
and
saw
these
two
books
on
the
shelf
and
he
picked
them
out
and
handed
the
clerk
the
money
and
the
clerk
wrapped
them
up
and
according
to
the
observer's
conversation
showing
the
record
which
i
take
it
the
petitioner
denies.
justice
abe
fortas
he
did
not
deny.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
well
then
in
the
event
if
you
start
thinking
about
this
case
in
terms
of
mens
rea,
perhaps
it
is
somewhat
impressive
that
the
policeman
selected
the
books
that
the
petitioner
was
a
clerk
he
did
not
place,
there's
no
evidence
that
he
was
responsible
for
displaying
these
books.
that
he
made
no
effort
to
persuade
the
policeman
to
take
these
books.
he
did
not
push
the
books
on
them,
he
did
not
suggest
the
books,
he
did
not
advertise
the
books,
and
he
did
not
place
the
books
on
the
rack.
now,
if
you
start
thinking
about
that
kind
of
a
situation
and
conventional
criminal
law
terms
then
you
get
a
kind
of
an
attenuated
mens
rea,
don't
you?
that
is
to
say
attenuated
in
the
sense
the
ancient
maxim
he
done
it,
didn't
he?
i
mean
to
say
he
sold
the
books
but
it
was
not
--
there's
no
indication
whatever
in
this
record
that
he
had
any
intent
to
purvey
or
to
promote
the
sale
of
this
particular
books
rather
than
other
books
using
the
phrase
or
the
word
in
ginzburg
there's
nothing
like
candor
that
is
involved
here.
if
there
is
mens
rea
it
is
a
very
attenuated
sort
of
mens
rea.
now,
if
you
take
that
line
of
approach
to
this
perhaps
you
get
a
different
view
of
what
scienter
means
as
applied
in
this
vexatious
field
or
perhaps
you
get
away
from
the
scienter
entirely
and
pursue
to
see
what
kind
of
trouble
you'll
get
into
using
the
phrase.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you'd
care
to
comment
on
that
i'd
be
most
grateful.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
obscenity
does
have
some
--
this
whole
field
has
something
to
do
with
the
first
amendment,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
question
is
-–
and
your
question
is
rather
there
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
theory
the
first
amendment
carves
out,
excepts,
eliminates,
and
make
some
exception
through
its
words
of
the
entire
feel
about
obscenity
whatever
that
may
mean.
justice
abe
fortas
or
whether
the
first
--
or
whether
the
only
permissible
exception
that
the
first
amendment
may
be
the
conduct
of
individuals
--
criminal
conduct.
in
fact
it
has
been
indicated
and
some
of
the
concurrences
and
the
sense
in
this
court.
i
believe
there's
something
to
that
effect
in
one
of
the
concurring
opinions
in
smith
against
california.
justice
abe
fortas
specific
intent.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
you
use
the
standard
of
specific
intent
here
as
we're
discussing
i
would
think
pretty
clearly
it
follows
that
that
is
not
present
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
except
you've
got
an
illustration
of
that,
the
opposite
thing
right
here
and
if
i'm
correct,
i
remember
people
against
finkelstein
and
they
also
have
many
case
in
minesotta.
the
clerk
--
justice
abe
fortas
with
the
products
in
the
criminal
process
because
a
policeman
comes
to
a
rack
and
picks
up
two
books,
hands
the
clerk
the
money.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
its
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
a
little
too
late
to
say
that
isn't
after
smith
against
california
when
which
ever
one
of
the
opinions
one
reads
or
the
one
reads
justice
harlan's
opinion.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
saying
about
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
other
case.
justice
abe
fortas
no.
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
the
manual
enterprises
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
that
it
says
it's
too
late
to
say
that
at
the
manual
enterprises
where
you'll
need
justice
harlan's
opinion
or
the
opinion
of
justice
brennan.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
too
late
to
say
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
show
that
thing
--
book
appeals
prurient
interest
and
from
that
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
don't
--
i
am
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
there
is
some
other
evidence
in
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
there
another
approach
to
it
and
that
is,
without
trying
to
answer
the
very
difficult
question
of
what
he
knew
or
he
believed
as
indicated
by
ginzburg
as
i
read
it,
that
the
man
promoted
that
what
he
sold,
that
he
tried
to
get
people
to
buy
it
on
his
representation
that
it
would
appeal
to
prurient
interest
or
whatever
more
suitable
words
might
be
so
that
you
don't
get
in
--
on
that
basis
perhaps
you
don't
get
into
the
refined
semantics
of
scienter,
may
be
getting
to
some
other
refined
semantics.
but
in
any
event
you
don't
get
into
those
particulars.
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
suggest
--
excuse
me,
but
i
didn't
suggest
eliminating
it,
i
suggested
the
possibility
that
when
you
start
using
as
your
instrument
for
a
decision,
not
the
legal
concept
of
scienter
but
the
legal
concept
of
specific
intent,
perhaps
then
the
role
played
by
the
concept
of
the
scienter
becomes
diluted
and
therefore
perhaps
the
necessity
for
a
precise
definition,
a
meticulous
finding
and
it
even
comes
less
appealable.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
that
make
it
unconstitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i,
may
i
put
it
this
way.
permit
me.
if
the
position
is
of
the
first
amendment
prohibits
the
sort
of
restraint
with
respect
to
adults,
it
started
with
that
proposition,
how
do
you
reach
with
both
hands
seems
to
be
a
qualification
of
it
and
say
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
prohibit
the
restraint
with
respect
to
children?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
redfield
--
justice
abe
fortas
from
this
entire
branch
of
your
argument,
that
is
to
say
the
extra
territorial
effect
on
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
statute
and
the
order.
i
would
be
grateful
if
you
would
explain
that
if
any
effect
the
general
appearance
of
your
clients
in
the
proceedings
below
may
have
had
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
because
i
understand
that
they
did
enter
a
general
appearance
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
obviously,
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
waiver?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
they
have
taken
on
the
grounds
of
--
in
part
on
the
grounds
of
extra
territorial
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you
--
it's
your
position
i
take
it,
i
don't
remember
that
it
was
briefed
by
you
at
the
--
i
thought
you
did
brief
it.
i
think
that
if
--
since
your
position
that
the
general
appearance
below,
without
any
reservation
or
any
qualification
did
not
constitute
a
submission
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
for
purposes
of
the
application
of
the
statute
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
applied?
justice
abe
fortas
that
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
supposed
a
new
york
publisher
sent
agents
down
into
arkansas
and
those
agents
open
up
a
newsstand
so
that
this
would
be
the
publisher
operating
directly
in
arkansas,
selling
this.
now
you
wouldn't
have
any
doubt
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arkansas
legislature
in
the
courts
there
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
--
but
the
theory
of
this
statute
that
the
jurisdiction
of
arkansas
attaches
here
because
of
--
acts
done
by
the
publisher
within
the
state
of
arkansas.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
statute
talks
in
terms
of
sending
across
and
to
be
sent
or
bringing
or
coursing
to
be
brought
into
the
state
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
allegedly
offending
material.
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
shows
the
mechanics,
what
happened
here
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
so
when
the
publishers
appear,
made
a
general
appearance
below,
did
they
make
this
point,
reserved
a
point,
offer
any
evidence
on
the
jurisdictional
point?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
there
was
general
submission
of
the
jurisdiction
in
the
court?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there's
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
no
point
was
made
out
of
the
theory
--
no
point
was
made
to
the
effect
that
these
publishers
are
not
found
or
doing
visits
in
the
state
of
arkansas?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
bringing
that
--
making
that
point
here
for
the
first
time?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
--
and
haply
it
does
bother
me,
i
wish
it
didn't
bother
me.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
is
kind
of
a
different
scienter
or
mens
rea
set
up
here,
first,
you
have
a
civil
proceeding,
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you
have
here,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
that
civil
proceeding,
as
i
am
dispended
as
applied
to
these
publications
which
are
mailable
and
non-mailable.
justice
abe
fortas
as
applied
to
these
publications
all
that
the
state
had
to
be
--
had
to
show
was
that
they
are
both
obscene
from
the
roth
test
or
--
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
once
that
was
shown,
then
the
judicial
determination
had
been
made.
it
doesn't
have
to
--
you
don't
have
to
show
any
intent
or
any
pandering
or
any
knowledge
of
content
or
knowledge
that
the
magazines
were
obscene.
isn't
that
correct
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
wait
a
minute.
let's
take
a
look
at
that.
will
you
give
me
that
exact
language?
only
has
--
it
says
that
every
person
whom
with
knowledge
of
its
current
offense
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
--
where
are
you,
what
page?
justice
abe
fortas
before
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
applies
to
proceedings
after
this
judicial
finding,
after
the
kind
of
proceeding
we
have
here.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
or
it
could
be
proven
but
there's
no
requirement.
justice
abe
fortas
we
have
to
do
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
show
that
the
publisher
for
example
of
gent
or
one
of
these
magazines
had
knowledge
of
its
contents,
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
i
assume
that
it
follows
that
somebody
who
publishes
a
magazine
is
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
its
contents,
or
do
you
construe
the
statute
as
requiring
something
beyond
that?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
we're
talking
here
about
publishers.
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
show
that
he
published
some
magazine.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
tell
you,
you
have
to
show
--
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
no
scienter
in
there
part
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
wait
a
minute
mr.
jackson,
i'm
sorry
to
take
your
time
but
you're
going
to
have
to
play
it
easy
and
help
me
on
this
thing.
the
--
this
proceeding,
that
we're
concerned
here
was
brought
and
could
be
brought
under
the
statute
just
on
the
basis
of
a
reasonable
belief
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
that
each
of
these
publishers
with
knowledge
of
the
contents
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
instrumental
in
send
--
shipping
the
magazine
into
the
state
and
that
the
magazine
is
obscene,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
way
the
action
was
commenced?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
what
results
is
a
judgment
as
it
did
in
this
case
requiring
that
the
issues
of
the
magazine
be
destroyed,
impounded,
etcetera,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
was
done
here
was
that
the
magazine
--
the
issues
of
the
magazine
were
to
be
destroyed.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
that's
phase
one,
that's
what
we
have
here
and
all
of
the
scienter
that's
involved
here
is
that
publishing
magazine,
therefore
he
has
knowledge
of
the
contents.
justice
abe
fortas
and
no
requirement
of
men
rea
either
beyond
what
we've
said.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand.
i'm
talking
to
you
if
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
i
may
about
this
phase
one
which
is
all
we
have
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
only
have
before
us
is
a
proceeding
and
which
says,
“no
requirement
of
scienter
or
mens
rea.”
justice
abe
fortas
now
somebody
violates
the
order
or
somebody
brings
in
to
the
state
and
let's
suppose
one
of
these
publishers,
despite
the
order
that
has
been
entered
in
the
proceeding
before
it,
sends
in
to
the
state
some
copies
of
the
particular
issue
of
the
magazine
that
has
been
condemned.
then
he
have
subject
to
criminal
prosecution,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
had
knowledge,
he
was
(voice
overlap)
and
since
he
had
knowledge
and
he
said,
“nevertheless,
the
copy
of
the
issue,
the
magazine
into
the
state.”
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
prosecuting
attorney
presumably
would
proceed
under
--
justice
abe
fortas
41-2716
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
the
number
here.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
under
that
provision,
is
there
any
requirement
of
a
specific
intent
scienter,
mens
rea
in
the
sense
that
publisher
brought
it
in
with
the
intent
of
selling,
distributing
something
knowing
it
to
be
obscene
and
with
the
purpose
of
capitalizing
on
its
quality
as
obscene
literature,
it's
a
very
rough
statement
of
what
a
--
well,
summed
up
by
--
what
i
sum
up
by
the
phrase
specific
intent.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
such
requirement
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
it
correct
that
under
41-2716,
the
prosecuting
attorney
would
bring
a
criminal
proceeding
against
the
publisher
in
the
keys
that
i
put
to?
all
he
would
have
to
show
is
that
the
publisher
has
sent
the
magazine
into
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
it's
--
the
magazines
being
sold
and
that
the
magazine,
the
issue
of
the
magazine
was
judicially
found
to
be
obscene
and
he's
made
his
case,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
we
agreed
on
that
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
do
you
think
that
this
is
any
different,
knowledge
of
its
contents
mean
something
different
in
2716
than
it
does
in
2717?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
let's
take
that
very
carefully
if
you
don't
mind.
in
2716,
which
is
this
proceeding,
the
civil
proceeding,
the
prosecuting
attorney
brings
the
case
on.
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
show
it
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
knowledge
of
contents
is
to
show
that
such
and
such
a
person
or
a
company
published
this
magazine.
that
satisfies
knowledge
of
contents
for
purposes
of
the
civil
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
subsequently,
after
--
this
--
that
a
civil
order
has
been
entered,
the
prosecuting
attorney
brings
a
criminal
proceeding,
are
you
telling
us
and
if
so,
what's
the
basis
of
it,
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
order
to
satisfy
that
same
requirement
mainly
with
knowledge
of
its
contents,
has
to
prove
something
else.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
what
i'm
going
to
ask
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
all
that.
here,
we
have
in
these
cases,
we
have
mailable
matter.
we
have
a
judicial
determination
in
the
proceeding
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
and
therefore,
we
have
knowledge
of
the
judicial
determination
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
case
that
i
have
put.
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
whether
it's
your
submission
to
this
court
that
the
prosecution
has
got
to
prove
anything
additionally
to
show
that
the
defendant
in
this
phase
number
two
proceeding
had
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
magazine.
justice
abe
fortas
of
what
kind?
that's
what
i'm
asking.
remember,
we're
talking
about
the
publisher.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
is
--
is
that
the
kind
of
showing
--
and
that's
the
kind
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
my
point
is
that
neither
phase
number
one
nor
phase
number
two,
if
i
correctly
understand
the
statute
in
your
explanation,
is
there
any
requirement
that
the
prosecution
proves
specific
intent
and
the
question
that
we
have
before
us
and
i
think
further
to
the
question
that
we
have
before
us
maybe,
whether
in
view
of
the
lack
of
necessity
in
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
showing
of
specific
intent
or
scienter
beyond
the
point
that
you
have
described?
and
either
phase
one
or
phase
two,
whether
in
view
of
that
fact,
phase
one,
the
phase
one
order,
is
constitutionally
defective.
justice
abe
fortas
you
and
i
know
that
there
are
lots
of
kinds
of
these
in
qualities
in
mens
rea
and
scienter
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
we're
talking
about
two
kinds
here.
i'm
talking
about
what
the
sort
refer
to
as
specific
intent
and
you're
referring
it
to
the
knowledge
of
the
contents,
etcetera.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
we
have
before
us
a
section
of
the
statute
dealing
with
non-mailable
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
i
said,
do
we
have
that,
the
court
determination?
aren't
all
of
these
magazines
mailable
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
statute
is
much
--
what
shall
i
say,
much
more
rugged
with
respect
to
non-mailable
matter
--
justice
abe
fortas
apparently
on
the
theory
that
you've
just
stated,
namely
that
the
matter
is
non-mailable,
it
does
not
have
the
advantage,
protection
or
sanctification
of
the
post
office
department
action
and
giving
it
a
second
--
allowing
it
the
exercise
second
class
privileges.
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
under
this
order
to
consider
subsequent
issues
in
the
magazines
so
that
they
can
go
ahead
and
have
what
presumably
would
be
a
very
snappy
procedure
with
respect
to
subsequent
issues,
when
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
--
that
same
(inaudible)
that
they
bring
to
the
court.
one
issue
--
one
of
these
issues
after
another
and
you
get
an
order,
isn't
that
the
way
it
works
without
the
time-consuming
process
of
service
and
the
usual
things
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
then
initiation
of
litigation.
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
complaint
they
answered
it,
i
assume.
justice
abe
fortas
you'd
have
to
do
a
set
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
effect,
what's
happening
here
is
that
the
court
refrains
jurisdiction
and
persona
--
and
these
defendants
render
in
the
days
so
far
as
appears
here,
so
long
as
they
have
magazines
appearing
on
the
stands
in
arkansas
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
don't
mind,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question.
i'm
concerned
here,
the
--
by
this
point,
if
i
correctly
understand
it.
the
standard
applied,
the
community
standard
applied
was
set
at
the
time
--
the
law
of
arkansas?
justice
abe
fortas
the
order,
as
entered
prohibit
it,
i
think
the
sale
of
these
magazines
anywhere
in
the
state,
in
other
words,
the
standard
applied
was
pine
bluff,
the
order
operates
statewide,
am
i
wrong
with
that
there?
justice
abe
fortas
the
order
applies
only
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
mean
another
action,
you
mean
another
hearing
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
same
action.
