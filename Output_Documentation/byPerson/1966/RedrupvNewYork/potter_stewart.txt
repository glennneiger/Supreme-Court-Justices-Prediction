justice
potter
stewart
but
the
ministers
want
to
get
rid
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
all
the
magazines?
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
prosecutor?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
sentence
did
this
man
get
from
that?
justice
potter
stewart
no
jail
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
annually?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
said,
contents
or
character?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
where
are
you
in
the
record?
where
is
this
page?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
an
instruction
given
to
the
jury
on
presumption
that
was
in
the
kentucky
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
have.
justice
potter
stewart
the
contents
and
the
character
of
said
magazines.
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
do
you
suppose
the
--
what
do
you
understand
by
the
meaning
of
character?
it's
something
different
from
contents
of?
justice
potter
stewart
its
pretty
clear
that
the
instructions
to
the
jury
were
erroneous,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
doesn't
say
a
word
about
the
necessity
of
a
material
being
not
only
without
regaining
social
importance.
justice
potter
stewart
or
it
doesn't
say
a
word
about
that
with
the
jury,
does
it,
as
a
necessity
of
what
the
jury
has
to
find
in
order
to
find
the
people?
the
jury
was
obscene
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
just
asking
about
it.
isn't
it
very
clear
that
the
instructions
to
the
jury
are
erroneous?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
did
say
a
word
about
the
--
is
there
a
word
about
the
necessity
of
the
material
being
utterly
lacking
any
redeeming
social
value?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
going
over
very
slowly
and
deliberately.
i
can't
find
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
in
instructions?
justice
potter
stewart
but
no,
just
erroneous.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
--
is
it
constitutional
question
in
constitutional
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it's
important.
i
just
can't
find
that
here
--
the
only
instructions
that
are
on
page
109
to
111?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
was
not
for
the
jury
to
determine?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
whole
point
that
would
said
that
for
which
he
was
offering
him
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
comparable.
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
now
standards
--
substantial
evidence
of
what?
or
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
what
mr.
rosenwein?
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
book?
or
that
he
knew
the
contents
and
that
book
was
obscene?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
suppose
--
let's
suppose
there's
a
complete
showing
or
sufficient
showing
that
he
knew
the
content
of
the
book.
then
how
do
you
show
that
he
knew
the
contents
were
obscene.
for
example,
particularly
if
you
have
a
difference
of
opinion
on
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
contents
were
obscene.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
enough
for
a
doubt
then
i
see
his
knowledge
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
don't
let
me
interrupt,
you
finish,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
you
have
just
reviewed,
slim
that
is
which
show
that
would
indicate
that
he
did
know
the
contents
of
the
book
because
he
compared
it
to
other
publications
there
on
the
table.
and
would
further
show
that
he
did
not
think
that
the
book
was
obscene
because
he
said
the
other
things
which
are
also
publicly
for
sale
there
were
more
offensive.
now
would
--
that's
not
what
the
evidence
indicates,
i
think,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
compares
the
book
with
something
else
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
imply
any
--
a
knowledge
of
that
book?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say
that
even
assuming,
he
knew
the
content
by
heart,
word
per
word.
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
still
is
as
guilty
on
the
appeal
also
that
it
was
of
a
qualitative
violated
criminal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
--
did
your
court
of
appeals
say
scienter
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
the
statutory
requirement
does?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
in
the
practical
operation
of
the
law
in
those
states
mr.
uviller
it's
a
two-step
thing,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
it?
you've
showed
--
you
show
knowledge
by
the
defendant
of
the
contents
of
the
book.
and
then
there's
a
finding
by
the
court
that
the
contents
are
obscene.
and
therefore
he
knew
the
contents.
we
say
it's
obscene
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
the
law
therefore
he
knew
it
was
obscene.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
about
the
process
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
was
not
obscene?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
what
if
we
accept
the
hypothesis
that
there
was
a
sufficient
evidence
in
this
case
to
show
that
he
knew
the
content
of
the
book
and
that
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise
as
to
whether
or
not
he
knew
it
was
obscene.
and
let's
say
that
among
the
membership
of
this
court
there's
a
division
of
the
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
that
involved
the
contents
are
obscene
and
there's
certainly
a
reasonable
doubt
about
his
knowledge
of
the
obscenity,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
are
those
that
think
that
any
suppression
of
good
faith
expression
is
an
anomaly
in
the
criminal
law
in
the
light
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
if
the
majority
in
this
court
should
find
that
neither
of
these
books
is
in
fact
obscene
and
there
could
not
be
a
conviction
even
though
you
show
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
books
and
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
they
were
obscene.
justice
potter
stewart
they
don't
see
how
you
can
separate
them
out
do
you
because
what
is
involved
here
is
his
knowledge.
his
knowledge,
and
if
as
you
say
even
though
he
knew
the
contents
and
even
though
he
had
a
good
faith
conviction
that
they
were
obscene
he
could
not
be
convicted
if
they
were
not
obscene.
justice
potter
stewart
you've
just
told
us
that
and
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
in
the
world
are
these
criteria
have
to
do
with
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
that's
the
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
why
it's
been
verbalized,
but
that's
not
the
way
the
courts
act
in
a
state?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
mens
rea
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
beguile
the
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
in
this
constitutional
case,
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
what
becomes
important
is
the
fact
that
this
man
is
making
$75.00
a
week
as
his
salary
as
contracted
to
mr.
ginzburg
who
has
been
sent
to
prison
for
five
years
because
he
was
making
more
money,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
that
relevant?
justice
potter
stewart
manual?
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
in
the
ginzburg
case
was
that
mr.
ginzburg
thought
that
what
he
was
publishing
was
protected
by
the
recent
decision
of
this
very
court.
he
talked
about
having
been
given
a
green
light.
and
it
was
as
i
read
and
understood
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
ginzburg
case
that
was
part
of
the
foundation
for
his
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
but
are
the
other
statutes
all
defined
obscenity
in
the
same
way
as
the
arkansan
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
definition
on
top
page
21
of
the
appendix
to
the
accounts
briefed
leaves
out
entirely
the
necessary
ingredient
of
totally
lacking
in
regaining
social
importance
to?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
statutory
definition
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they're
completely
deficient
in
that
essential
ingredient,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
wasn't
here
when
roth
was
written
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
--
and
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
all
of
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
this
area
where
they
have
that
opinions
of
the
court
but
my
understanding
of
one
of
the
opinions
in
the
massachusetts
case
last
term
was
that
there
had
to
be
--
that
a
--
that
in
order
prosecute
or
suppress
something
in
the
teeth
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
that
something
had
to
have
three
conjunctive
ingredients,
not
disjunctive.
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
which
was
that
it
be
utterly
lacking
in
any
redeeming
social
importance,
so
that's
just
not
in
the
statute
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
it
points
to
the
other
states,
it
might
have
been
a
better
word
just
to
use
the
word
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
that
has
a
continuing
--
it's
continually
redefined
in
the
decisions
of
this
in
other
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
what
your
legislature
did?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
really
important,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
here
there
was
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
jury
here,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
was
an
advisory
jury
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
was
the
advisory
jury
instructed
us
to
the
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
could
if
the
--
but
the
statute
doesn't
require
it
to.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
did
--
did
either
the
jury
or
the
court
do
so
here?
justice
potter
stewart
or
did
they,
either
one?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
instructions
to
this
advisory
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
instructions
to
the
advisory
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
they
in
the
record,
do
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
ministers
want
to
get
rid
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
all
the
magazines?
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
prosecutor?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
sentence
did
this
man
get
from
that?
justice
potter
stewart
no
jail
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
annually?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
said,
contents
or
character?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
where
are
you
in
the
record?
where
is
this
page?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
an
instruction
given
to
the
jury
on
presumption
that
was
in
the
kentucky
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
have.
justice
potter
stewart
the
contents
and
the
character
of
said
magazines.
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
do
you
suppose
the
--
what
do
you
understand
by
the
meaning
of
character?
it's
something
different
from
contents
of?
justice
potter
stewart
its
pretty
clear
that
the
instructions
to
the
jury
were
erroneous,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
doesn't
say
a
word
about
the
necessity
of
a
material
being
not
only
without
regaining
social
importance.
justice
potter
stewart
or
it
doesn't
say
a
word
about
that
with
the
jury,
does
it,
as
a
necessity
of
what
the
jury
has
to
find
in
order
to
find
the
people?
the
jury
was
obscene
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
just
asking
about
it.
isn't
it
very
clear
that
the
instructions
to
the
jury
are
erroneous?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
did
say
a
word
about
the
--
is
there
a

about
the
necessity
of

being
utterly
lacking

justice

stewart
i'm

i
can't
find
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
in

justice
potter
stewart
but
no,
just
erroneous.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
--
is
it
constitutional
question
in
constitutional
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it's
important.
i
just
can't
find
that

the

neither
of
these
books
is
in
fact
obscene
and
there
could
not
be
a
conviction
even
though
you
show
that
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
books
and
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
they
were
obscene.
justice
potter
stewart
they
don't
see
how
you
can
separate
them
out
do
you
because
what
is
involved
here
is
his
knowledge.
his
knowledge,
and
if
as
you
say
even
though
he
knew
the
contents
and
even
though
he
had
a
good
faith
conviction
that
they
were
obscene
he
could
not
be
convicted
if
they
were
not
obscene.
justice
potter
stewart
you've
just
told
us
that
and
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
in
the
world
are
these
criteria
have
to
do
with
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
that's
the
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
why
it's
been
verbalized,
but
that's
not
the
way
the
courts
act
in
a
state?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
mens
rea
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
beguile
the
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
in
this
constitutional
case,
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
what
becomes
important
is
the
fact
that
this
man
is
making
$75.00
a
week
as
his
salary
as
contracted
to
mr.
ginzburg
who
has
been
sent
to
prison
for
five
years
because
he
was
making
more
money,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
that
relevant?
justice
potter
stewart
manual?
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
in
the
ginzburg
case
was
that
mr.
ginzburg
thought
that
what
he
was
publishing
was
protected
by
the
recent
decision
of
this
very
court.
he
talked
about
having
been
given
a
green
light.
and
it
was
as
i
read
and
understood
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
ginzburg
case
that
was
part
of
the
foundation
for
his
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
but
are
the
other
statutes
all
defined
obscenity
in
the
same
way
as
the
arkansan
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
definition
on
top
page
21
of
the
appendix
to
the
accounts
briefed
leaves
out
entirely
the
necessary
ingredient
of
totally
lacking
in
regaining
social
importance
to?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
statutory
definition
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they're
completely
deficient
in
that
essential
ingredient,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
wasn't
here
when
roth
was
written
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
--
and
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
all
of
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
this
area
where
they
have
that
opinions
of
the
court
but
my
understanding
of
one
of
the
opinions
in
the
massachusetts
case
last
term
was
that
there
had
to
be
--
that
a
--
that
in
order
prosecute
or
suppress
something
in
the
teeth
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
that
something
had
to
have
three
conjunctive
ingredients,
not
disjunctive.
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
which
was
that
it
be
utterly
lacking
in
any
redeeming
social
importance,
so
that's
just
not
in
the
statute
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
it
points
to
the
other
states,
it
might
have
been
a
better
word
just
to
use
the
word
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
that
has
a
continuing
--
it's
continually
redefined
in
the
decisions
of
this
in
other
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
what
your
legislature
did?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
really
important,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
here
there
was
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
jury
here,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
was
an
advisory
jury
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
was
the
advisory
jury
instructed
us
to
the
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
could
if
the
--
but
the
statute
doesn't
require
it
to.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
did
--
did
either
the
jury
or
the
court
do
so
here?
justice
potter
stewart
or
did
they,
either
one?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
instructions
to
this
advisory
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
instructions
to
the
advisory
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
they
in
the
record,
do
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
