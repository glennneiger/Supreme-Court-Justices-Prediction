mr.
sam
rosenwein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
--
this
case
arises
on
a
certiorari
to
the
appellate
term
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
york.
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
under
an
obscenity
law
under
the
state
obscenity
law.
certiorari
was
limited,
three
justices
dissenting
to
the
issue
of
scienter.
the
case
arose
in
the
following
manner,
on
april
10,
1964,
a
patrolman
named
grakenstein
(ph)
came
to
a
newsstand
on
42nd
street
that
was
about
6
p.m.
and
this
newsstand
was
at
a
subway
arcade,
an
entrance
to
a
subway
arcade.
he
said
to
the
attendant,
the
clerk,
the
petitioner
here
pointing
to
a
book
rack,
lust
pool
and
shame
agent,
two
books
of
those
two
types.
the
petitioner
gave
him
the
two
books.
so
testified
the
police
officer.
and
he
gave
the
petitioner
a
dollar
for
the
two
books.
the
petitioner
said,
“they're
90
cents
each.”
and
he
said,
“i'm
sorry”
then
pointed
to
the
one
that
said
75.
and
the
petitioner
said,
“well
then
give
me
$1.65.”
he
paid
the
$1.65
for
the
two
books,
then
he
placed
it
in
a
brown
paper
bag
after
that
he
had
taken
the
bag,
he
announced
that
he
was
a
police
officer.
the
clerk
said
to
him,
the
petitioner
here,
“what's
wrong?”
this
fellow
have
a
search
warrant
to
search
the
place.
he
wasn't
permitted
to
state
what
kind
of
search
he
conducted.
he
said
he
--
he
asked
the
petitioner
who
he
worked
for.
the
petitioner
said,
he
worked
for
a
milton
black.
he
asked
him
how
long
he
have
worked
there.
he
said,
“about
two
years”
alternating
between
a
bookstore
downstairs
in
the
subway
and
this
newsstand.
he
stated
to
the
officer,
again,
this
is
the
conversation
that
he
earns
$75.00
a
week.
and
then
the
officer
said
to
him
calling
to
the
officer,
“why
do
you
sell
this
garbage?”
and
he
says,
“there's
worse
stuff
than
that
around,
i
think
that
these
books
here
are
worse,”
pointing
to
some
girly
magazines
that
were
on
top.
this
was
the
testimony
after
the
prosecution
and
prosecution
rested
at
that
point.
the
petitioner
took
the
stand.he
testified
that
he
had
been
working
for
this
mr.
black
for
about
two
years.
his
salary
was
$75.00
a
week.
he
had
never
been
in
any
trouble
before,
never
arrested
or
convicted
of
any
offense
or
anything
to
that
kind.
he
hadn't
read
these
books
and
knew
anything
about
the
contents
of
the
books.
he
had
no
recollection
of
his
alleged
oral
conversation
he
was
supposed
to
have
with
the
police
officer
and
in
general
simply
stated
that
he
had
been
there
for
about
an
hour,
he
was
relieving
somebody
who
had
been
ill.
he
had
once
relieved
that
way
about
a
week
before,
but
generally
he
was
downstairs
within
the
bookstore
generally.
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sam
rosenwein
a
suspended
sentence.
the
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
they
had
various
books
there.
there
were
westerns
and
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
to
except
that
there
was
some
inquiry.
"well,
do
you
have
these
kinds
of
books
here
and
did
you
see
other
books,”
and
he
said,
“yes,
there
were
other
books
of
this
kind
here.”
that
is
but
all
that
you
have
in
this
newsstand
and
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
the
--
or
as
far
as
oral
conversation
was
concerned,
the
officer
testified
that
while
it
was
his
custom
to
make
notes
of
every
conversation
he
had
on
arrest,
at
this
time
he
had
not
made
any
notes
of
such
a
conversation
and
nor
had
he
included
in
the
complaint.
that
in
general
is
the
case
and
the
basic
question
here
on
appeal
is
whether
or
not
the
evidence
in
the
constitutional
sense
is
sufficient
to
the
obscenity
prosecution
to
establish
the
guilty
knowledge
in
a
lawful
intent
that
is
required
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
on
that
issue
to
start
off
with,
i
would
simply
say
this
court
has
stated
on
many
occasions
that
when
factual
issues
come
to
the
court
entangled
in
some
constitutional
claim,
that
it
will
review
the
evidence
with
the
scrupulous
care
demanded
by
the
constitution
that
i
take
it
to
be
basic.
secondly,
this
court
has
stated
that
the
standards
for
judging
whether
or
not
the
proof
is
sufficient
where
first
amendment
issues
are
involved,
where
criminal
--
alleged
criminal
speech
is
involved
are
very
high.
in
civil
actions,
this
court
has
spoken
of
it
as
--
it
has
to
be
clear,
convincing,
and
unequivocal.
without
any
troubling
doubt
as
solid
in
criminal
cases,
this
court
has
stated.
it
has
to
be
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
at
the
substantial
evidence.
our
position
here
is
that
based
on
those
standards.
those
standards
as
applied
to
this
case
have
been
misapplied.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
that
he
knew
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well
obviously,
the
question
must
be
that
he
knew
that
the
contents
were
obscene.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
it
would
always
be
a
question
as
to
how
you
would
prove
it.
but
in
answer
to
that,
may
i
state
this,
this
court
has
stated
in
roth,
in
jacobellis,
in
memoirs,
that
the
elements
of
the
effects
of
obscenity
before
you
can
be
found
guilty
as
far
as
the
book
is
concerned
is
that
that
book
must
go
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
under
the
fiction
of
sex.
it
has
to
appeal
to
a
prurient
interest
and
has
to
be
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
and
this
must
be
--
this
must
coalesce
although
independent.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
now,
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
now,
if
that
be
the
situation
if
you
have
to
prove
that,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
follows
that
the
scienter
you're
talking
about,
that
you
spoke
about
in
smith
against
california
must
be
the
knowledge
as
in
any
case
whether
it's
criminal
or
not.
knowledge
that
these
elements
exist.
otherwise,
he
doesn't
know
that
it's
obscene.
it
follows
therefore
that
the
problem
is
not
standard
and
this
is
where
the
difficulty
comes
from
my
friend's
brief.
the
problem
is
not
standard
they
must
prove
knowledge
of
obscenity,
the
question
is,
how
much
must
they
prove?
what
is
the
quality
of
proof?
how
much
proof
must
there
be
for
that
standard?
but
for
a
trial
judge
to
tell
the
jury
that
all
you
have
to
find
out
is
that's
he
knew
the
contents
and
he
is
guilty
on
scienter
would
not
be
following
the
standards
that
are
required
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decisions.
now,
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
--
at
most
but
i
would
say
this,
your
honor
that
i
don't
quite
follow
even
as
to
knowledge
of
contents.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
if
i
say
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
he's
looking
at
the
cover,
and
that's
all
he
had.
he
put
them
in
the
bag,
he
looked
at
the
cover
and
he
said,
he
looks
at
another
and
has
another
cover
to
similar
kind
and
he
simply
says,
"i
think
this
is
worse
than
that."
and
after
all,
all
the
officer
were
saying
this
is
pretty
offensive,
this
is
pretty
tasteless,
and
he
was
saying
well
i
think
this
is
more
offensive.
and
he
was
pointing
to
two
magazines
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
had
been
held
to
be
constitutionally
protected
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
twice
in
people
against
richmond
county,
and
in
lockett
against
g.i.
distributors.
so
it
was
--
he
was
clearly
innocent.
now,
as
to
whether
he
knew
the
contents,
i
say
you're
just
making
a
jump
because
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
if
you
--
yes,
you'd
have
to
have
some
evidence
to
show
that
it
is
never
enough
it
seems
to
me.
i
say
this
factually.
it's
never
enough
to
merely
say
a
man
were
shown
to
have
read
the
book
or
to
have
known
the
contents
and
per
se
with
nothing
else
with
no
other
acts
or
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
say
that
merely
from
the
reading
of
the
book
one
can
infer
that
he
knew
that
the
book
went
beyond
community
standards
and
appealed
to
prurient
interest
and
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
the
trial
court
simply
has
the
duty
to
say
to
the
jury
that
you
must
find
that
he
knew
the
book
was
obscene
as
i
defined
obscenity.
now,
you
can
of
course
find
that
from
all
the
elements
in
the
case,
all
the
circumstances
in
the
case.
what
he
did,
and
if
he
read
the
book
etcetera.
but
that
in
essence
is
the
case.
now,
based
on
that,
based
on
these
standards
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
a
case
has
been
made
out
here
on
the
constitutional
sense
to
support
this
conviction
on
the
scienter
issue.
he
was
an
innocent
clerk.
everything
that's
in
this
case
shows
innocence,
price
is
just
nominal.
the
statement
is
just
a
statement
of
protestation
of
innocence.
he'd
never
been
convicted
before.
he
denied
he
had
the
conversation
and
i
must
say
as
far
as
oral
conversations
are
concerned,
oral
admissions,
wigmore
--
professor
wigmore
has
pointed
out
that's
the
most
untrustworthy.
you
want
to
come
in
to
say,
“why
do
you
keep
this
and
would
you
want
your
children
to
read
this?”
and
then
immediately
he
has
known
that
--
he
has
assumed
to
know
the
contents
of
the
book
but
to
know
that
it's
obscene.
if
that
practice
were
assumed
no
bookseller
or
distributor
would
be
safe.
and
so,
we
think
that
actually
all
that
has
been
proven
here
is
innocence
and
innocence
never
proves
guilt
and
certainly
in
the
case
involving
the
first
amendment
that
should
be
the
end
of
it
and
that
conviction.
necessarily
would
have
to
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
it
has
however
been
interpreted
in
this
court
knows.
your
honor
know
in
michigan
and
i
take
it
and
i'm
assuming
despite
some
of
the
vagueness
of
its
language
which
was
quoted
in
michigan
that
that
means
knowledge
of
obscenity
and
knowing
that
the
book
is
obscene,
intentionally
selling
it
the
calculated
purpose
of
appealing
to
prurient
interest
and
knowing
that
it
goes
beyond
temporary
standards.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
of
course.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
that
is
correct.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
would
say
it
would
necessarily
have
to
because
it
doesn't
even
include
the
word
unlawfully
on
this,
but
it
has
been
construed
by
the
state
court
as
including
that
and
reference
was
made
to
that
michigan,
people
against
finkelstein
there
was
that
construction
although
as
i
say
somewhat
vague
and
i
have
construed
it
as
being
able
knowledge
of
obscenity.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
it
--
in
answering
the
arguments
of
the
state
to
it
--
once
again
state
that
this
court
in
smith
against
california
reiterated
and
carried
forward
the
thought
that
it
had
announced
in
roth
and
alvis
(ph),
that
an
obscenity
limitation
on
speech
is
an
exception
and
therefore
the
standards
for
judging
obscenity
would
have
to
be
narrowed.
and
as
against
claims
of
vagueness,
against
claims
of
possible
self-censorship
this
court
said,
"we
will
put
in
a
requirement
of
scienter."
and
in
smith
reiterated
that
that
the
obscenity
laws
in
general
would
be
in
serious
difficulty
constitutionally
unless
there
was
proof
of
scienter.
now
this
court
also
had
said,
time
and
again
in
cases
as
a
significant
as
perhaps
this
area,
cases
involving
advocacy
built
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
there
must
be
proof
of
specific
intent,
there
must
be
proof
of
guilty
knowledge
because
if
you
don't
have
that
then
there
are
possibilities,
great
possibilities
of
self-censorship.
people
will
be
afraid
to
talk.
people
will
be
afraid
to
write.
people
will
be
afraid
to
express
themselves
and
the
whole
country
and
the
community
suffers
as
a
result.
now,
what
does
the
state
argue
here?
the
state
virtually
tells
us
that
although
the
man
who
sells
the
book
or
distributes
or
even
the
publisher
is
absolutely
innocent
in
his
intent.
he
really
doesn't
know.
and
they
can't
prove
that
he
knows.
nevertheless,
he
must
stand
convicted.
can
this
lead
to
anything
else
if
the
rule
is
adopted
that
the
state
asked
for,
which
is
not
only
a
delusion
of
the
scienter
requirement
but
actually
elimination
and
a
pre-smith
situation.
can
it
be
anything
else
but
the
same
self-censorship
which
this
court
has
constantly
tried
to
admonish
must
not
happen.
now
as
far
as
ginzburg
is
concerned,
my
friend
forgets
the
cause
that
in
michigan,
this
court
emphasized
that
the
scienter
proof
is
stringent.
and
as
far
as
ginzburg
was
concerned
i
think
the
question
of
scienter
was
stipulated
out.
and
if
it
--
as
to
whether
ginzburg
believed
that
it
was
constitutionally
protected,
i
suppose
an
answer
might
be
a
trier
of
the
facts
if
you
had
proof.
if
the
record
in
ginzburg
had
proof
that
nevertheless
would
show
that
he
did
believe
it
was
obscene,
then
i
suppose
you
have
a
situation
where
you
didn't
have
to
believe
them.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
your
honor.
let
me
say
this
that
if
the
record
in
the
ginzburg
case
which
of
course
i'm
not
familiar
had
no
evidence
of
the
man's
guilty
knowledge
or
specific
intent.
and
if
that
issue
was
open
i
would
think
that
he
had
been
unfairly
convicted.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
now,
i
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
now
on
the
question
of
specific
intent
and
guilty
knowledge
that
was
raised
by
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
simply
this,
i
had
always
understood
that
both
elements
are
required
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
states
of
louisiana
and
ohio,
those
are
the
two
requirements.
but
one
is
dependent
on
the
other.
in
other
words,
specific
intent,
the
intent
to
appeal
the
prurient
interest
knowing
that
it
goes
beyond
community
standards
and
has
any
value,
that
specific
intent
to
appeal
the
prurient
interest
is
a
state
of
mind.
how
do
you
prove
a
state
of
mind?
only
by
the
clearest
proof
that
the
man
had
guilty
knowledge.
so
that
you
would
have
to
prove
that
he
knew
that
the
material
was
obscene.
he
knew
that
it
went
beyond
contemporary
standards
and
knew
that
it
had
appealed
to
a
prurient
interest
and
knew
he
was
utterly
without
value
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
you
would,
your
honor.
come
into
another
series
of
problems
if
you
eliminated
scienter
or
guilty
knowledge.
the
man
had
to
know.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
and
i
--
if
i
may
continue
this
dialogue,
your
honor,
just
for
one
more
moment
then
i
would
say
this,
that
if
you
do
attempt
to
--
you
have
these
two
standards
that
is
guilty
knowledge
plus
a
specific
intent
and
in
any
way
try
to
dilute
one
or
the
other,
you
always
have
the
basic
problem,
how
does
this
comport
with
first
amendment
requirements?
will
this
lead
to
ambiguity,
further
ambiguity?
and
will
this
lead
to
the
type
of
self
censorship
which
we
must
avoid
if
speech
in
press
ought
to
be
free
in
the
country?
in
any
event,
i
return
to
my
initial
position
here
that
there
is
simply
no
evidence
in
the
constitutional
sense
that
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
conviction
that's
like
redmond.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
--
this
case
arises
on
a
certiorari
to
the
appellate
term
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
york.
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
under
an
obscenity
law
under
the
state
obscenity
law.
certiorari
was
limited,
three
justices
dissenting
to
the
issue
of
scienter.
the
case
arose
in
the
following
manner,
on
april
10,
1964,
a
patrolman
named
grakenstein
(ph)
came
to
a
newsstand
on
42nd
street
that
was
about
6
p.m.
and
this
newsstand
was
at
a
subway
arcade,
an
entrance
to
a
subway
arcade.
he
said
to
the
attendant,
the
clerk,
the
petitioner
here
pointing
to
a
book
rack,
lust
pool
and
shame
agent,
two
books
of
those
two
types.
the
petitioner
gave
him
the
two
books.
so
testified
the
police
officer.
and
he
gave
the
petitioner
a
dollar
for
the
two
books.
the
petitioner
said,
“they're
90
cents
each.”
and
he
said,
“i'm
sorry”
then
pointed
to
the
one
that
said
75.
and
the
petitioner
said,
“well
then
give
me
$1.65.”
he
paid
the
$1.65
for
the
two
books,
then
he
placed
it
in
a
brown
paper
bag
after
that
he
had
taken
the
bag,
he
announced
that
he
was
a
police
officer.
the
clerk
said
to
him,
the
petitioner
here,
“what's
wrong?”
this
fellow
have
a
search
warrant
to
search
the
place.
he
wasn't
permitted
to
state
what
kind
of
search
he
conducted.
he
said
he
--
he
asked
the
petitioner
who
he
worked
for.
the
petitioner
said,
he
worked
for
a
milton
black.
he
asked
him
how
long
he
have
worked
there.
he
said,
“about
two
years”
alternating
between
a
bookstore
downstairs
in
the
subway
and
this
newsstand.
he
stated
to
the
officer,
again,
this
is
the
conversation
that
he
earns
$75.00
a
week.
and
then
the
officer
said
to
him
calling
to
the
officer,
“why
do
you
sell
this
garbage?”
and
he
says,
“there's
worse
stuff
than
that
around,
i
think
that
these
books
here
are
worse,”
pointing
to
some
girly
magazines
that
were
on
top.
this
was
the
testimony
after
the
prosecution
and
prosecution
rested
at
that
point.
the
petitioner
took
the
stand.he
testified
that
he
had
been
working
for
this
mr.
black
for
about
two
years.
his
salary
was
$75.00
a
week.
he
had
never
been
in
any
trouble
before,
never
arrested
or
convicted
of
any
offense
or
anything
to
that
kind.
he
hadn't
read
these
books
and
knew
anything
about
the
contents
of
the
books.
he
had
no
recollection
of
his
alleged
oral
conversation
he
was
supposed
to
have
with
the
police
officer
and
in
general
simply
stated
that
he
had
been
there
for
about
an
hour,
he
was
relieving
somebody
who
had
been
ill.
he
had
once
relieved
that
way
about
a
week
before,
but
generally
he
was
downstairs
within
the
bookstore
generally.
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sam
rosenwein
a
suspended
sentence.
the
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
they
had
various
books
there.
there
were
westerns
and
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
to
except
that
there
was
some
inquiry.
"well,
do
you
have
these
kinds
of
books
here
and
did
you
see
other
books,”
and
he
said,
“yes,
there
were
other
books
of
this
kind
here.”
that
is
but
all
that
you
have
in
this
newsstand
and
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
the
--
or
as
far
as
oral
conversation
was
concerned,
the
officer
testified
that
while
it
was
his
custom
to
make
notes
of
every
conversation
he
had
on
arrest,
at
this
time
he
had
not
made
any
notes
of
such
a
conversation
and
nor
had
he
included
in
the
complaint.
that
in
general
is
the
case
and
the
basic
question
here
on
appeal
is
whether
or
not
the
evidence
in
the
constitutional
sense
is
sufficient
to
the
obscenity
prosecution
to
establish
the
guilty
knowledge
in
a
lawful
intent
that
is
required
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
on
that
issue
to
start
off
with,
i
would
simply
say
this
court
has
stated
on
many
occasions
that
when
factual
issues
come
to
the
court
entangled
in
some
constitutional
claim,
that
it
will
review
the
evidence
with
the
scrupulous
care
demanded
by
the
constitution
that
i
take
it
to
be
basic.
secondly,
this
court
has
stated
that
the
standards
for
judging
whether
or
not
the
proof
is
sufficient
where
first
amendment
issues
are
involved,
where
criminal
--
alleged
criminal
speech
is
involved
are
very
high.
in
civil
actions,
this
court
has
spoken
of
it
as
--
it
has
to
be
clear,
convincing,
and
unequivocal.
without
any
troubling
doubt
as
solid
in
criminal
cases,
this
court
has
stated.
it
has
to
be
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
at
the
substantial
evidence.
our
position
here
is
that
based
on
those
standards.
those
standards
as
applied
to
this
case
have
been
misapplied.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
that
he
knew
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well
obviously,
the
question
must
be
that
he
knew
that
the
contents
were
obscene.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
it
would
always
be
a
question
as
to
how
you
would
prove
it.
but
in
answer
to
that,
may
i
state
this,
this
court
has
stated
in
roth,
in
jacobellis,
in
memoirs,
that
the
elements
of
the
effects
of
obscenity
before
you
can
be
found
guilty
as
far
as
the
book
is
concerned
is
that
that
book
must
go
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
under
the
fiction
of
sex.
it
has
to
appeal
to
a
prurient
interest
and
has
to
be
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
and
this
must
be
--
this
must
coalesce
although
independent.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
now,
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
now,
if
that
be
the
situation
if
you
have
to
prove
that,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
follows
that
the
scienter
you're
talking
about,
that
you
spoke
about
in
smith
against
california
must
be
the
knowledge
as
in
any
case
whether
it's
criminal
or
not.
knowledge
that
these
elements
exist.
otherwise,
he
doesn't
know
that
it's
obscene.
it
follows
therefore
that
the
problem
is
not
standard
and
this
is
where
the
difficulty
comes
from
my
friend's
brief.
the
problem
is
not
standard
they
must
prove
knowledge
of
obscenity,
the
question
is,
how
much
must
they
prove?
what
is
the
quality
of
proof?
how
much
proof
must
there
be
for
that
standard?
but
for
a
trial
judge
to
tell
the
jury
that
all
you
have
to
find
out
is
that's
he
knew
the
contents
and
he
is
guilty
on
scienter
would
not
be
following
the
standards
that
are
required
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decisions.
now,
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
--
at
most
but
i
would
say
this,
your
honor
that
i
don't
quite
follow
even
as
to
knowledge
of
contents.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
if
i
say
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
he's
looking
at
the
cover,
and
that's
all
he
had.
he
put
them
in
the
bag,
he
looked
at
the
cover
and
he
said,
he
looks
at
another
and
has
another
cover
to
similar
kind
and
he
simply
says,
"i
think
this
is
worse
than
that."
and
after
all,
all
the
officer
were
saying
this
is
pretty
offensive,
this
is
pretty
tasteless,
and
he
was
saying
well
i
think
this
is
more
offensive.
and
he
was
pointing
to
two
magazines
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
had
been
held
to
be
constitutionally
protected
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
twice
in
people
against
richmond
county,
and
in
lockett
against
g.i.
distributors.
so
it
was
--
he
was
clearly
innocent.
now,
as
to
whether
he
knew
the
contents,
i
say
you're
just
making
a
jump
because
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
if
you
--
yes,
you'd
have
to
have
some
evidence
to
show
that
it
is
never
enough
it
seems
to
me.
i
say
this
factually.
it's
never
enough
to
merely
say
a
man
were
shown
to
have
read
the
book
or
to
have
known
the
contents
and
per
se
with
nothing
else
with
no
other
acts
or
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
say
that
merely
from
the
reading
of
the
book
one
can
infer
that
he
knew
that
the
book
went
beyond
community
standards
and
appealed
to
prurient
interest
and
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
the
trial
court
simply
has
the
duty
to
say
to
the
jury
that
you
must
find
that
he
knew
the
book
was
obscene
as
i
defined
obscenity.
now,
you
can
of
course
find
that
from
all
the
elements
in
the
case,
all
the
circumstances
in
the
case.
what
he
did,
and
if
he
read
the
book
etcetera.
but
that
in
essence
is
the
case.
now,
based
on
that,
based
on
these
standards
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
a
case
has
been
made
out
here
on
the
constitutional
sense
to
support
this
conviction
on
the
scienter
issue.
he
was
an
innocent
clerk.
everything
that's
in
this
case
shows
innocence,
price
is
just
nominal.
the
statement
is
just
a
statement
of
protestation
of
innocence.
he'd
never
been
convicted
before.
he
denied
he
had
the
conversation
and
i
must
say
as
far
as
oral
conversations
are
concerned,
oral
admissions,
wigmore
--
professor
wigmore
has
pointed
out
that's
the
most
untrustworthy.
you
want
to
come
in
to
say,
“why
do
you
keep
this
and
would
you
want
your
children
to
read
this?”
and
then
immediately
he
has
known
that
--
he
has
assumed
to
know
the
contents
of
the
book
but
to
know
that
it's
obscene.
if
that
practice
were
assumed
no
bookseller
or
distributor
would
be
safe.
and
so,
we
think
that
actually
all
that
has
been
proven
here
is
innocence
and
innocence
never
proves
guilt
and
certainly
in
the
case
involving
the
first
amendment
that
should
be
the
end
of
it
and
that
conviction.
necessarily
would
have
to
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
no,
it
has
however
been
interpreted
in
this
court
knows.
your
honor
know
in
michigan
and
i
take
it
and
i'm
assuming
despite
some
of
the
vagueness
of
its
language
which
was
quoted
in
michigan
that
that
means
knowledge
of
obscenity
and
knowing
that
the
book
is
obscene,
intentionally
selling
it
the
calculated
purpose
of
appealing
to
prurient
interest
and
knowing
that
it
goes
beyond
temporary
standards.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
of
course.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
that
is
correct.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
would
say
it
would
necessarily
have
to
because
it
doesn't
even
include
the
word
unlawfully
on
this,
but
it
has
been
construed
by
the
state
court
as
including
that
and
reference
was
made
to
that
michigan,
people
against
finkelstein
there
was
that
construction
although
as
i
say
somewhat
vague
and
i
have
construed
it
as
being
able
knowledge
of
obscenity.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
it
--
in
answering
the
arguments
of
the
state
to
it
--
once
again
state
that
this
court
in
smith
against
california
reiterated
and
carried
forward
the
thought
that
it
had
announced
in
roth
and
alvis
(ph),
that
an
obscenity
limitation
on
speech
is
an
exception
and
therefore
the
standards
for
judging
obscenity
would
have
to
be
narrowed.
and
as
against
claims
of
vagueness,
against
claims
of
possible
self-censorship
this
court
said,
"we
will
put
in
a
requirement
of
scienter."
and
in
smith
reiterated
that
that
the
obscenity
laws
in
general
would
be
in
serious
difficulty
constitutionally
unless
there
was
proof
of
scienter.
now
this
court
also
had
said,
time
and
again
in
cases
as
a
significant
as
perhaps
this
area,
cases
involving
advocacy
built
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
there
must
be
proof
of
specific
intent,
there
must
be
proof
of
guilty
knowledge
because
if
you
don't
have
that
then
there
are
possibilities,
great
possibilities
of
self-censorship.
people
will
be
afraid
to
talk.
people
will
be
afraid
to
write.
people
will
be
afraid
to
express
themselves
and
the
whole
country
and
the
community
suffers
as
a
result.
now,
what
does
the
state
argue
here?
the
state
virtually
tells
us
that
although
the
man
who
sells
the
book
or
distributes
or
even
the
publisher
is
absolutely
innocent
in
his
intent.
he
really
doesn't
know.
and
they
can't
prove
that
he
knows.
nevertheless,
he
must
stand
convicted.
can
this
lead
to
anything
else
if
the
rule
is
adopted
that
the
state
asked
for,
which
is
not
only
a
delusion
of
the
scienter
requirement
but
actually
elimination
and
a
pre-smith
situation.
can
it
be
anything
else
but
the
same
self-censorship
which
this
court
has
constantly
tried
to
admonish
must
not
happen.
now
as
far
as
ginzburg
is
concerned,
my
friend
forgets
the
cause
that
in
michigan,
this
court
emphasized
that
the
scienter
proof
is
stringent.
and
as
far
as
ginzburg
was
concerned
i
think
the
question
of
scienter
was
stipulated
out.
and
if
it
--
as
to
whether
ginzburg
believed
that
it
was
constitutionally
protected,
i
suppose
an
answer
might
be
a
trier
of
the
facts
if
you
had
proof.
if
the
record
in
ginzburg
had
proof
that
nevertheless
would
show
that
he
did
believe
it
was
obscene,
then
i
suppose
you
have
a
situation
where
you
didn't
have
to
believe
them.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
your
honor.
let
me
say
this
that
if
the
record
in
the
ginzburg
case
which
of
course
i'm
not
familiar
had
no
evidence
of
the
man's
guilty
knowledge
or
specific
intent.
and
if
that
issue
was
open
i
would
think
that
he
had
been
unfairly
convicted.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
now,
i
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
now
on
the
question
of
specific
intent
and
guilty
knowledge
that
was
raised
by
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
simply
this,
i
had
always
understood
that
both
elements
are
required
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
states
of
louisiana
and
ohio,
those
are
the
two
requirements.
but
one
is
dependent
on
the
other.
in
other
words,
specific
intent,
the
intent
to
appeal
the
prurient
interest
knowing
that
it
goes
beyond
community
standards
and
has
any
value,
that
specific
intent
to
appeal
the
prurient
interest
is
a
state
of
mind.
how
do
you
prove
a
state
of
mind?
only
by
the
clearest
proof
that
the
man
had
guilty
knowledge.
so
that
you
would
have
to
prove
that
he
knew
that
the
material
was
obscene.
he
knew
that
it
went
beyond
contemporary
standards
and
knew
that
it
had
appealed
to
a
prurient
interest
and
knew
he
was
utterly
without
value
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
you
would,
your
honor.
come
into
another
series
of
problems
if
you
eliminated
scienter
or
guilty
knowledge.
the
man
had
to
know.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
and
i
--
if
i
may
continue
this
dialogue,
your
honor,
just
for
one
more
moment
then
i
would
say
this,
that
if
you
do
attempt
to
--
you
have
these
two
standards
that
is
guilty
knowledge
plus
a
specific
intent
and
in
any
way
try
to
dilute
one
or
the
other,
you
always
have
the
basic
problem,
how
does
this
comport
with
first
amendment
requirements?
will
this
lead
to
ambiguity,
further
ambiguity?
and
will
this
lead
to
the
type
of
self
censorship
which
we
must
avoid
if
speech
in
press
ought
to
be
free
in
the
country?
in
any
event,
i
return
to
my
initial
position
here
that
there
is
simply
no
evidence
in
the
constitutional
sense
that
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
conviction
that's
like
redmond.
