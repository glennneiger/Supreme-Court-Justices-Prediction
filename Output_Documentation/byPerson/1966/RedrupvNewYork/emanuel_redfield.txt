mr.
emanuel
redfield
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
represent
seven
magazines
whose
names
appear
in
the
title
of
this
action,
as
well
as
their
publishers.
all
of
these
magazines
were
published
outside
of
the
state
of
arkansas
and
all
the
publishers
are
non-residence
of
arkansas.
six
of
them
are
from
new
york
and
one
is
from
connecticut.
yet,
they
have
been
subjected
to
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
for
that
--
for
the
courts
of
that
state
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
publications
may
be
sent
through
the
mails
and
otherwise
across
state
lines
into
the
state
of
arkansas.
an
action
was
brought
in
the
county
of
jefferson
in
arkansas,
in
a
little
town
with
20,000
population
by
the
name
of
pine
bluff.
and
the
court
adjudicated
these
magazines
to
be
obscene
although
they
have
national
circulation
and
are
accepted
as
readily
as
the
playboy
magazine
or
anything
of
similar
types
of
magazines
in
current
circulation.
i'm
not
going
into
the
question
whether
or
not
these
magazines
are
obscene
because
of
the
limited
review
in
this
case.
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
statute
and
the
record
was
made
on
the
statute
alone.
the
object
of
the
statute
as
--
has
specifically
stated
among
other
things,
is
to
catch
the
nonresident
authors
and
publishers.
they
state
that
in
section
2714
if
your
honors
are
following
me.
the
statute
provides
that
the
mere
sending
of
the
literature
across
state
lines
into
arkansas
shall
be
deemed
a
submission
by
the
sender
to
the
jurisdiction
of
arkansas.
and
that
a
statute
--
an
action
may
be
commenced
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
(voice
overlap)
for
adjudication
of
the
obscenity
of
mailable
matter.
and
i
emphasize
the
obscenity
of
mailable
matter
because
i
think
it
will
be
a
bothersome
phrase
because
to
me
it
seems
contradictory.
the
statute
also
provide
with
service
on
the
nonresident
office
and
publishing
by
mail.
and
i
should
emphasize
too
that
this
statute
as
distinct
from
the
one
you
had
here
nine
years
ago
in
the
kingsley
books
case
does
not
fix
a
period
for
trial
immediately
after
joined
thereof
issue,
nor
does
it
fix
a
period
for
the
determination
of
the
issue
as
we
had
continuably
books.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
does
not
provide
for
non
--
was
anything
like
that
determined.
and
the
--
a
judgment
may
be
rendered
declaring
the
obscenity
of
the
publication
and
enjoined
any
act
condemn
by
the
statute
and
it
may
direct
a
respondent
to
dispose
of
obscene
mailable
matter
and
may
direct
the
sheriff
to
seize
and
destroy
all
such
obscene
mailable
matter
in
control
of
the
respondents
wherever
it
may
be
found.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
and
contempt
proceedings
have
provided
together
with
the
extradition
of
the
publisher
in
the
event
should
fail
to
abide
by
the
decree
and
should
he
fail
to
do
so,
he
may
be
subjected
also
to
a
felony
prosecution
with
one
year
in
jail
and
a
$2000
fine.
now,
as
i
said
before,
none
of
my
clients
are
residents
of
arkansas.
in
order
to
show
a
cause
was
issued
in
february
of
'64,
they
appeared
with
an
advisory
jury
trial
hand
and
the
jury
advised
the
court
that
these
books
were
obscene
whereupon
the
court
entered
a
decree
declaring
their
obscenity
and
enjoin
the
appellants
from
sending
or
causing
to
be
sent
into
jefferson
county
the
above
magazines.
he
does
not
say
which
issues.
he
just
talks
about
the
above
magazines.
that
all
said
magazines
shall
be
destroyed
within
ten
days
by
them
and
the
court
retained
jurisdiction.
he
determined
whether
or
not
subsequent
issues
of
the
magazines
may
be
obscene.
now,
this
is
not
the
kingsley
book
case
which
i
argued
here
nine
years
ago.
it
has
certain
features
that
are
similar
but
it
does
not
wind
itself
at
all
within
the
context
of
the
kingsley
opinion.
and
i
should
add
too
as
i
emphasized
before
that
although
this
court
recently
in
the
freeman
against
maryland
case
sort
of
found
favor
was
the
kingsley
statute
in
a
sort
of
a
model.
in
kingsley,
there
was
a
provision
for
a
trial
one
day
after
the
issue
was
joined.
and
the
decision
had
to
be
rendered
within
two
days.
and
i
suppose
that
is
why
the
statute
appealed
to
the
court
in
the
freedman
case,
as
we've
--
some
of
the
justices.
i
--
i
have
not
been
reconciled
to
the
kingsley
decision
as
a
protection
of
the
right
of
speech
that
is
guaranteed
fourteenth
and
first
amendments.
but
i
know
from
--
i
hope
i
know
that
i'm
not
quixotic
enough
to
ask
this
court
to
overrule
it
in
view
of
what
happen
in
the
freedman
case.
but,
as
i
cannot
help
observing
that
one
of
the
features
that
you
might
have
heard
--
one
of
the
counsel
who
might
have
been
on
my
side
say
--
that
he
say
that
this
sort
of
a
procedure
because
it
lends
a
certain
amount
of
security
to
the
bookseller
and
perhaps
it
does.
i'm
pretty
sure
he's
mistaken
because
i
have
seen
cases,
at
least
one
case
i've
participated
in
where
the
--
moving
picture
censor,
order
of
the
state
of
new
york
granted
a
license
for
the
reduction
--
for
the
showing
of
a
motion
picture
and
nevertheless,
the
police
department
in
the
city
of
new
york
threaten
the
exhibitor
because
he
claimed
it
was
obscene
although
the
censorship
board
held
it
to
be
non-obscene.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
any
security
in
this
form
of
a
statute.
but
some
people
as
i
say
are
always
looking
for
security,
i've
even
found
people
who
find
security
in
jail
and
they're
willing
to
go
to
jail
for
the
sake
of
the
comfort
they
may
find
there.
but
being
as
it
may,
there's
a
great
distinction
here
between
kingsley
and
the
arkansas
statute.
in
kingsley,
there
was
no
attempt
to
control
the
authors
and
publishers
who
were
non-residence.
the
statute
operated
against
persons
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
books
that
were
found
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
here,
there
is
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
that
they
are
trying
to
reach
the
out-of-towners.
so
it
makes
the
publisher
and
author
in
new
york
subject
to
the
terms
of
this
statute.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
don't
think
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
they've
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
they
might
have
waived
it
so
far
as
that
service
has
summed
it
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
waiving
the
effect
and
operation
of
the
statute.
they
still
attack
the
statute,
as
i
am
doing
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
they
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
its
not.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
one
has
to
do
with
the
other
to
question
one
appearing
in
a
court
and
not
forcing
another
to
serve
you
outside
the
state
or
anywhere
else
but
just
coming
in
and
still
maintaining
--
you
claim
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
has
this
effect
upon
the
out-of-towner.
i
don't
think
it
--
i
don't
think
the
procedure
with
respect
to
the
service
of
the
summons
has
anything
to
do
with
the
operation
of
this
law.
if
this
statute
would
mean
that
an
author
or
publisher
who
conducts
himself
in
new
york
by
standards
of
new
york
would
become
amenable
to
the
laws
of
every
other
middle
pine
bluff
in
the
united
states
of
which
we
have
a
myriad
of
them.
now,
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
these
magazines
were
perfectly
inoffensive.
gent
magazine
for
example
was
a
magazine
involved
in
a
richmond
county
case
which
the
court
has
noted
in
several
opinions.
and
if
gent
case
was
published
and
distributed
in
new
york
under
the
new
york
concepts
of
what
is
bad
or
obscene,
it
would
place
a
publisher
or
an
author
in
a
--
not
only
unfair
but
in
--
it
would
burden
them
completely
if
he
couldn't
send
them
out
across
state
lines
without
the
fear
that
he
was
going
to
be
subjected
to
every
little
town
that
decides
for
itself,
what
this
--
its
standards
are.
it
appeared
as
a
burden
on
him,
of
having
to
engage
counsel
in
every
little
town
that
decided
to
initiate
proceedings
like
this
against
him.
and
moreover,
he
couldn't
meet
the
standards
of
every
little
town
in
advance.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
if
he's
operating
within
arkansas
then
he
--
he's
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
resident
of
arkansas.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
don't
think
they
are
doing
that.
they
make
no
claim
as
to
because
there
wasn't
--
no
such
act
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
nor
does
the
statute
make
any
provision
for
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
if
the
--
the
claim
is
merely
that
these
publications
originated
outside
of
arkansas,
they
were
being
shipped
toward
arkansas
and
they
were
going
to
stop
them.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
that's
what
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
at
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir.
there
was
no
--
there's
no
evidence
taken
on
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
general
submission
in
a
sense
that
they've
submitted
to
the
processes
of
the
court.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
was
to
the
--
there
were
no
--
submitting
to
the
statute.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir.
there
was
no
such
issue
at
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
it's
all
part
of
the
same
question
as
to
--
i
mean,
i'm
not
involving
myself
with
a
question
that
you
are
raising
because
i
didn't
think
its
part
of
the
case
at
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
don't
see
why
it
should
bother
you
because
it's
an
entirely
different
question
from
what's
involved
here.
for
example,
if
in
kingsley
books
case,
if
the
local
publisher
or
author
was
served
with
summons
incorrectly,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
constitutional
or
not.
he
could
still
come
into
court
and
make
a
general
appearance
and
attack
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
it's
a
form
of
a
restriction
on
a
speech.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
don't
see
why
they
have
to.
they
could
always
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
they
could
always
--
they
could
attack
the
statute
even
by
a
general
appearance?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
we're
not
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
we're
not
fighting
here
the
method
of
service
on
them.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
arkansas
would
probably
--
would
render
a
decree
by
default.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
they
were
in
arkansas,
yes
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
they'd
insist
in
here,
they
just
went
after
the
--
went
after
them
by
what
they
call
this
in
rem
proceeding
to
have
it
determine
whether
or
not
the
books
were
obscene
or
not.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
--
yes,
there
was
a
book
distributor
there,
people
there.
now,
in
--
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
something
that
would
seem
obvious
but
could
stand
repetitions
that
in
the
jacobellis
case
this
court
pointed
out
that
we
cannot
tolerate
the
situation
whether
limits
of
expressions
fixed
by
state
lines
only.
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
state
of
another
generation
in
1909
in
the
international
textbook
case,
pointed
out
that
even
where
a
correspondent
school
was
required
--
a
correspondent
school
of
pennsylvania
was
required
to
qualify
as
a
foreign
corporation
in
another
state
before
it
could
maintain
a
suit,
that
justice
harlan
writing
for
the
court
held
such
a
requirement
unconstitutional
because
this
was
an
obstruction
to
the
transmission
of
intelligence
from
one
state
to
the
other.
and
i
suppose
those
sentiments
can
be
brought
up
to
date
by
other
members
of
the
court.
and
in
the
case
of
licey
v.
haden
(ph)
where
one
of
the
states
attempted
to
prevent
the
sending
of
liquor
across
state
lines
into
that
state,
this
court
held
that
the
sending
--
even
a
sending
of
liquor
was
forbidden
--
i
mean,
even
the
obstruction
to
the
importation
of
liquor
within
a
state
would
be
condemned.
yet
this
court
has
held
from
time
--
time
and
time
again
that
the
literature
certainly
is
on
a
higher
level
than
liquor.
the
burden
that
was
placed
on
the
author
and
publisher
here
unjustly
to
nothing
but
timidity
and
terrorize
them.
and
the
expense
in
defending
everywhere
would
be
just
another
added
burden
to
his
already
harassed
job
of
being
a
publisher.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
represent
seven
magazines
whose
names
appear
in
the
title
of
this
action,
as
well
as
their
publishers.
all
of
these
magazines
were
published
outside
of
the
state
of
arkansas
and
all
the
publishers
are
non-residence
of
arkansas.
six
of
them
are
from
new
york
and
one
is
from
connecticut.
yet,
they
have
been
subjected
to
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
for
that
--
for
the
courts
of
that
state
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
publications
may
be
sent
through
the
mails
and
otherwise
across
state
lines
into
the
state
of
arkansas.
an
action
was
brought
in
the
county
of
jefferson
in
arkansas,
in
a
little
town
with
20,000
population
by
the
name
of
pine
bluff.
and
the
court
adjudicated
these
magazines
to
be
obscene
although
they
have
national
circulation
and
are
accepted
as
readily
as
the
playboy
magazine
or
anything
of
similar
types
of
magazines
in
current
circulation.
i'm
not
going
into
the
question
whether
or
not
these
magazines
are
obscene
because
of
the
limited
review
in
this
case.
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
statute
and
the
record
was
made
on
the
statute
alone.
the
object
of
the
statute
as
--
has
specifically
stated
among
other
things,
is
to
catch
the
nonresident
authors
and
publishers.
they
state
that
in
section
2714
if
your
honors
are
following
me.
the
statute
provides
that
the
mere
sending
of
the
literature
across
state
lines
into
arkansas
shall
be
deemed
a
submission
by
the
sender
to
the
jurisdiction
of
arkansas.
and
that
a
statute
--
an
action
may
be
commenced
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
(voice
overlap)
for
adjudication
of
the
obscenity
of
mailable
matter.
and
i
emphasize
the
obscenity
of
mailable
matter
because
i
think
it
will
be
a
bothersome
phrase
because
to
me
it
seems
contradictory.
the
statute
also
provide
with
service
on
the
nonresident
office
and
publishing
by
mail.
and
i
should
emphasize
too
that
this
statute
as
distinct
from
the
one
you
had
here
nine
years
ago
in
the
kingsley
books
case
does
not
fix
a
period
for
trial
immediately
after
joined
thereof
issue,
nor
does
it
fix
a
period
for
the
determination
of
the
issue
as
we
had
continuably
books.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
does
not
provide
for
non
--
was
anything
like
that
determined.
and
the
--
a
judgment
may
be
rendered
declaring
the
obscenity
of
the
publication
and
enjoined
any
act
condemn
by
the
statute
and
it
may
direct
a
respondent
to
dispose
of
obscene
mailable
matter
and
may
direct
the
sheriff
to
seize
and
destroy
all
such
obscene
mailable
matter
in
control
of
the
respondents
wherever
it
may
be
found.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
and
contempt
proceedings
have
provided
together
with
the
extradition
of
the
publisher
in
the
event
should
fail
to
abide
by
the
decree
and
should
he
fail
to
do
so,
he
may
be
subjected
also
to
a
felony
prosecution
with
one
year
in
jail
and
a
$2000
fine.
now,
as
i
said
before,
none
of
my
clients
are
residents
of
arkansas.
in
order
to
show
a
cause
was
issued
in
february
of
'64,
they
appeared
with
an
advisory
jury
trial
hand
and
the
jury
advised
the
court
that
these
books
were
obscene
whereupon
the
court
entered
a
decree
declaring
their
obscenity
and
enjoin
the
appellants
from
sending
or
causing
to
be
sent
into
jefferson
county
the
above
magazines.
he
does
not
say
which
issues.
he
just
talks
about
the
above
magazines.
that
all
said
magazines
shall
be
destroyed
within
ten
days
by
them
and
the
court
retained
jurisdiction.
he
determined
whether
or
not
subsequent
issues
of
the
magazines
may
be
obscene.
now,
this
is
not
the
kingsley
book
case
which
i
argued
here
nine
years
ago.
it
has
certain
features
that
are
similar
but
it
does
not
wind
itself
at
all
within
the
context
of
the
kingsley
opinion.
and
i
should
add
too
as
i
emphasized
before
that
although
this
court
recently
in
the
freeman
against
maryland
case
sort
of
found
favor
was
the
kingsley
statute
in
a
sort
of
a
model.
in
kingsley,
there
was
a
provision
for
a
trial
one
day
after
the
issue
was
joined.
and
the
decision
had
to
be
rendered
within
two
days.
and
i
suppose
that
is
why
the
statute
appealed
to
the
court
in
the
freedman
case,
as
we've
--
some
of
the
justices.
i
--
i
have
not
been
reconciled
to
the
kingsley
decision
as
a
protection
of
the
right
of
speech
that
is
guaranteed
fourteenth
and
first
amendments.
but
i
know
from
--
i
hope
i
know
that
i'm
not
quixotic
enough
to
ask
this
court
to
overrule
it
in
view
of
what
happen
in
the
freedman
case.
but,
as
i
cannot
help
observing
that
one
of
the
features
that
you
might
have
heard
--
one
of
the
counsel
who
might
have
been
on
my
side
say
--
that
he
say
that
this
sort
of
a
procedure
because
it
lends
a
certain
amount
of
security
to
the
bookseller
and
perhaps
it
does.
i'm
pretty
sure
he's
mistaken
because
i
have
seen
cases,
at
least
one
case
i've
participated
in
where
the
--
moving
picture
censor,
order
of
the
state
of
new
york
granted
a
license
for
the
reduction
--
for
the
showing
of
a
motion
picture
and
nevertheless,
the
police
department
in
the
city
of
new
york
threaten
the
exhibitor
because
he
claimed
it
was
obscene
although
the
censorship
board
held
it
to
be
non-obscene.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
any
security
in
this
form
of
a
statute.
but
some
people
as
i
say
are
always
looking
for
security,
i've
even
found
people
who
find
security
in
jail
and
they're
willing
to
go
to
jail
for
the
sake
of
the
comfort
they
may
find
there.
but
being
as
it
may,
there's
a
great
distinction
here
between
kingsley
and
the
arkansas
statute.
in
kingsley,
there
was
no
attempt
to
control
the
authors
and
publishers
who
were
non-residence.
the
statute
operated
against
persons
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
books
that
were
found
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
here,
there
is
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
that
they
are
trying
to
reach
the
out-of-towners.
so
it
makes
the
publisher
and
author
in
new
york
subject
to
the
terms
of
this
statute.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
don't
think
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
they've
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
they
might
have
waived
it
so
far
as
that
service
has
summed
it
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
waiving
the
effect
and
operation
of
the
statute.
they
still
attack
the
statute,
as
i
am
doing
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
they
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
its
not.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
one
has
to
do
with
the
other
to
question
one
appearing
in
a
court
and
not
forcing
another
to
serve
you
outside
the
state
or
anywhere
else
but
just
coming
in
and
still
maintaining
--
you
claim
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
has
this
effect
upon
the
out-of-towner.
i
don't
think
it
--
i
don't
think
the
procedure
with
respect
to
the
service
of
the
summons
has
anything
to
do
with
the
operation
of
this
law.
if
this
statute
would
mean
that
an
author
or
publisher
who
conducts
himself
in
new
york
by
standards
of
new
york
would
become
amenable
to
the
laws
of
every
other
middle
pine
bluff
in
the
united
states
of
which
we
have
a
myriad
of
them.
now,
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
these
magazines
were
perfectly
inoffensive.
gent
magazine
for
example
was
a
magazine
involved
in
a
richmond
county
case
which
the
court
has
noted
in
several
opinions.
and
if
gent
case
was
published
and
distributed
in
new
york
under
the
new
york
concepts
of
what
is
bad
or
obscene,
it
would
place
a
publisher
or
an
author
in
a
--
not
only
unfair
but
in
--
it
would
burden
them
completely
if
he
couldn't
send
them
out
across
state
lines
without
the
fear
that
he
was
going
to
be
subjected
to
every
little
town
that
decides
for
itself,
what
this
--
its
standards
are.
it
appeared
as
a
burden
on
him,
of
having
to
engage
counsel
in
every
little
town
that
decided
to
initiate
proceedings
like
this
against
him.
and
moreover,
he
couldn't
meet
the
standards
of
every
little
town
in
advance.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
if
he's
operating
within
arkansas
then
he
--
he's
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
resident
of
arkansas.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
don't
think
they
are
doing
that.
they
make
no
claim
as
to
because
there
wasn't
--
no
such
act
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
nor
does
the
statute
make
any
provision
for
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
if
the
--
the
claim
is
merely
that
these
publications
originated
outside
of
arkansas,
they
were
being
shipped
toward
arkansas
and
they
were
going
to
stop
them.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
that's
what
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
at
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir.
there
was
no
--
there's
no
evidence
taken
on
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
general
submission
in
a
sense
that
they've
submitted
to
the
processes
of
the
court.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
was
to
the
--
there
were
no
--
submitting
to
the
statute.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir.
there
was
no
such
issue
at
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
it's
all
part
of
the
same
question
as
to
--
i
mean,
i'm
not
involving
myself
with
a
question
that
you
are
raising
because
i
didn't
think
its
part
of
the
case
at
all.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
don't
see
why
it
should
bother
you
because
it's
an
entirely
different
question
from
what's
involved
here.
for
example,
if
in
kingsley
books
case,
if
the
local
publisher
or
author
was
served
with
summons
incorrectly,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
constitutional
or
not.
he
could
still
come
into
court
and
make
a
general
appearance
and
attack
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
it's
a
form
of
a
restriction
on
a
speech.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
don't
see
why
they
have
to.
they
could
always
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
they
could
always
--
they
could
attack
the
statute
even
by
a
general
appearance?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
we're
not
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
we're
not
fighting
here
the
method
of
service
on
them.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
arkansas
would
probably
--
would
render
a
decree
by
default.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
they
were
in
arkansas,
yes
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
they'd
insist
in
here,
they
just
went
after
the
--
went
after
them
by
what
they
call
this
in
rem
proceeding
to
have
it
determine
whether
or
not
the
books
were
obscene
or
not.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
but
--
yes,
there
was
a
book
distributor
there,
people
there.
now,
in
--
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
something
that
would
seem
obvious
but
could
stand
repetitions
that
in
the
jacobellis
case
this
court
pointed
out
that
we
cannot
tolerate
the
situation
whether
limits
of
expressions
fixed
by
state
lines
only.
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
state
of
another
generation
in
1909
in
the
international
textbook
case,
pointed
out
that
even
where
a
correspondent
school
was
required
--
a
correspondent
school
of
pennsylvania
was
required
to
qualify
as
a
foreign
corporation
in
another
state
before
it
could
maintain
a
suit,
that
justice
harlan
writing
for
the
court
held
such
a
requirement
unconstitutional
because
this
was
an
obstruction
to
the
transmission
of
intelligence
from
one
state
to
the
other.
and
i
suppose
those
sentiments
can
be
brought
up
to
date
by
other
members
of
the
court.
and
in
the
case
of
licey
v.
haden
(ph)
where
one
of
the
states
attempted
to
prevent
the
sending
of
liquor
across
state
lines
into
that
state,
this
court
held
that
the
sending
--
even
a
sending
of
liquor
was
forbidden
--
i
mean,
even
the
obstruction
to
the
importation
of
liquor
within
a
state
would
be
condemned.
yet
this
court
has
held
from
time
--
time
and
time
again
that
the
literature
certainly
is
on
a
higher
level
than
liquor.
the
burden
that
was
placed
on
the
author
and
publisher
here
unjustly
to
nothing
but
timidity
and
terrorize
them.
and
the
expense
in
defending
everywhere
would
be
just
another
added
burden
to
his
already
harassed
job
of
being
a
publisher.
