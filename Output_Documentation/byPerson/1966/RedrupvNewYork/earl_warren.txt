chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fleishman,
is
it
your
position
that
the
government
should
have
neither
the
state
nor
the
federal
government
should
have
any
part
to
restrict
what
the
people
publish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
know
but
you
talk
always
of
censorship
and
i
just
wonder
if
you
consider
any
limitation
of
any
kind
that
government
puts
on
what
is
published
to
be
censorship.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
sometimes
get
caught
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
and
because
that
might
happen,
do
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
has
no
right
of
any
kind
to
protect
decency
by
some
limitations
on
what
is
published
even
though
it
might
be
vile
and
(inaudible)
to
the
extreme
hardcore
pornography,
if
you
want
to
use
that
term,
but
they
must
let
(inaudible).
so
anything
that
they
wanted
or
they
want
us
out
to
children
in
the
public
school
or
any
place
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
limit
it?
that's
what
i'd
like
to
get
asked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
what
constitutional
section
do
you
rely
on
to
separate
what
can
be
sold
to
adults
and
what
can
be
sold
to
minors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
without
in
the
context
of
this
case,
would
that
be
the
same
principle
that's
involved
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
i'm
just
asking
what
constitutional
--
what
section
of
the
constitution
separates
one
from
the
other?
can
you
give
me
that
without
you
saying
prince
case,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
what
section
of
the
constitution
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.

mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
just
this
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
some
are
or
rather
i
don't
get
that
from
this
language,
is
this
further
considered,
ordered
and
decreed
that
the
defendants
are
hereby
notified
that
any
future
distribution
or
sale
of
the
above
magazines,
and
that
doesn't
mean
the
specific
ones
there
--
they
are
which
they
--
you're
talking
about
which
are
of
like
obscene
character
comparable
to
the
above
issues
of
said
magazine
will
be
enjoined
upon
a
showing
of
that
--
if
the
magazines
are
obscene.
now
does
that
simply
mean
that
if
they
dared
to
publish
any
magazine
of
like
character,
that
they
can
be
summoned
in
the
court
on
an
order
to
show
cause
under
this
injunction
and
have
those
burned
in
the
same
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page?
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
18,
yes.
well,
i
took
