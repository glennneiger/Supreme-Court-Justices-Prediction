do
you

we
haven't
found

i

suppose
it

well,
that
might
be
[laughter]
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
asking
you
questions
so
you
can
argue
it
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
argument
that
the
state
could
not
constitutionally
make
it
a
violation
to
sell
obscene
magazines
even
though
the
owner
was
unfamiliar
with
the
obscenity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
that
it
could
not
be,
the
state
could
not
constitutionally
make
procession
of
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
making
liquor,
possession
of
liquor
a
violation
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
premise
--
but
the
premise
is
as
i
understand
it
that
the
obscene
literature
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
the
government
must
prove,
the
prosecution
must
prove
a
person
has
sold
a
magazine,
had
read
it,
knew
in
some
way
that
it
was
obscene
or
else
he
could
not
be
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
he
just
didn't
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
should
require
the
bookseller
to
read
all
the
literature
they
have
in
their
bookstore.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
could
not
be
convicted
for
selling
obscene
literature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
always
get
to
wait
until
they
found
out
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
as
an
advocate
of
censorship
but
i'm
just
asking
you
the
question
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
argument
is
that,
make
it
difficult,
make
it
difficult
but
has
censorship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we're
going
to
have
it,
why
shouldn't
he
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
there
any
stopping
shown
of
just
leaving
it
always
to
the
community
standard
right
if
the
thing
occurred
and
then
let
them
decide
what
books
they
will
have,
what
magazines
they'll
have,
which
one
is
they
won't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
court
short
order
that
except
to
say
that
obscenity
is
protected
by
the
first

(voice

justice

but
wouldn't
just
be
of
any
of
the

the

to
do
it
which
i
didn't
read
it,
i
don't
know
anything
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
suggesting
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
a
system
whereby
no
bookseller
should
be
convicted
unless
the
stated
book
has
been
adjudicated
