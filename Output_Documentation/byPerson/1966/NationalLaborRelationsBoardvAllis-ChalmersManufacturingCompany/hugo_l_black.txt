left

so
it
is
not
true
that
that
law
provides
that
a
person
need
not
belong
to
a

remain
a
union
member
if

wants

justice

i
thought
the
basic
reason
for
the
law
in
this
field
of
the
argument
whether
good
or
bad
that
a
man
should
not
be
forced
to
join
a
union
or
to
remain
a
member
of
a
union,
to
stay
a
member
of
a
union
in
order
to
get
a
job
if
he
ought
to
have
the
right
to
keep
that
job
otherwise
without
that,
and
that
that
carried
with
it
the
idea
that
the
two
--
two
alternatives.
one,
a
man
could
pay
his
dues
and
have
that
freedom
or
not
pay
his
dues
and
not
have
that
freedom,
but
what
you
say
now
is
it
actually
leaves
it
open
to
the
union
to
control
whether
he
shall
remain
a
member
or
whether
he
should
get
out
and
exercise
what
they
claim
to
be
the
right
of
a
free
foreign
man
to
work
without
belonging
to
a
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
you
say
that
the
union
got
power
to
take
that
away
from
him
from
that
proviso,
and
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
was
right.
