mr.
john
silard
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
union,
we
have
the
temerity
to
suggest
that
there
are
really
four
separate
and
conclusive
reasons
why
we
have
--
the
union
has
not
violated
the
statute.
the
first
is
that
union
discipline
of
members
is
exempted
from
the
labor
board's
jurisdiction
by
the
text
on
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
its
proviso.
the
second
reason
is
that
in
section
7
of
the
act,
every
employee
has
the
choice
of
abstention
from
or
participation
in
concerted
protected
activity,
but
once
the
worker
chooses
to
join
the
union,
he
is
bound
to
his
election
of
participation
over
former
statutory
right
of
abstention.
thirdly
--
mr.
john
silard
mr.
justice
white,
the
common
law
courts
have
given
relief
in
that
situation
for
about
a
hundred
years
and
they
have
been
very
rigorous
and
we
cite
many
cases.
i
will
get
to
this.
mr.
john
silard
where
any
exceeding
of
the
union's
constitutional
powers
and
the
norm
that's
applied
in
the
fairness
of
the
procedures
is
grounds,
not
only
for
setting
aside
fines,
but
for
setting
aside
suspensions
and
expulsions.
and
we
would
not
stand
here
to
defend
--
mr.
john
silard
there
could
be
no
fine
which
the
courts
--
the
common
law
courts
would
enforce
under
any
property
or
con
--
contract
theory
whether
you
would
have
a
violation
of
the
statute
here,
there's
a
different
question
that
i
would
say
not,
and
i
will
get
to
that
if
you
permit
it.
in
a
moment
i
would
like
to
outline
my
four
points
and
then
i'll
certainly
will
cover
this
--
this
question.
we
would
urge
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
statute,
even
if
the
--
the
unreasonableness
in
the
enforcement
of
the
internal
union
rules,
procedural
or
otherwise,
may
be
a
basis
of
a
landrum-griffin,
a
griffin
violation
it
is,
it's
a
procedural
violation
but
not
nlra
violation.
the
third
ground
upon
which
we
believe
this
labor
board's
decision
in
this
case
was
right,
is
that
there
must
be
some
rule
of
reason
in
the
application
of
the
restraint
or
coerce
clause.
there's
been
a
rule
of
reason
in
the
restraint
clause
of
the
sherman
act
for
many
years.
we
see
no
reason
for
denying
one
here,
and
if
there's
any
rule
of
reason
in
what
constitute
restraint
or
coercion
under
this
statutory
clause,
we
are
within
the
most
reasonableness
of
all
the
rules.
and
fourth,
and
perhaps
the
most
important
point
we
would
make
is
this.
this
court
in
american
ship
building
rules
that
the
employer
can
enforce
a
concerted
work
refusal
on
every
member
of
the
union
and
every
employee
as
a
bargaining
device.
and
the
statute
becomes
incongruous
and
imbalanced
if
now
labor
unions
can
no
longer
enforce
a
concerted
work
refusal
even
on
their
own
members.
the
traditional
strike
weapon
has
then
been
taken
from
the
unions
and
given
to
the
employer.
mr.
john
silard
i
say
--
i
say
the
--
the
american
ship
held
that
the
employer
can
invade
the
right
to
work
under
section
7
of
every
single
one
of
his
employees
as
a
warning
device
if
he
decides
to
lock
them
out,
he
--
a
concerted
work
stoppage
denial
of
the
right
to
work.
we
say
the
imbalance
here
is
created
if
the
employer
can
lockout
all
the
workers
and
deny
them
work,
as
a
--
as
a
bargaining
device
now,
but
the
union
can
no
longer
affect
the
--
a
work
stoppage
even
by
its
own
members
who
have
pledged
that
they
would
abide
by
the
union
norms.
it's
an
imbalance
and
then
an
incongruity
which
we
would
say
should
be
resisted.
mr.
john
silard
well,
the
section
7
would
give
the
employees
all
of
the
right
not
to
engage
in
a
concerted
work
refusal,
and
prior
to
american
ship,
that
were
meant
not
to
be
made
parties
to
a
consider
work
refusal
whether
initiated
by
the
union,
by
a
strike
or
by
the
employer
by
a
lockout.
let
me
get
that
in
a
moment.
and
i
--
and
i
say
this
to
mr.
justice
brennan
literalism
in
the
construction
of
this
statute
is
a
trap.
and
we
think
if
we're
going
to
have
literalism,
the
company
has
fallen
into
the
trap
because
we
believe
we
are
literally
excluded
by
the
proviso
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
from
the
coverage
of
8
section
(b)
(1)
itself.
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
by
looking
at
page
3
of
the
blue
brief,
at
the
very
top,
the
actual
text
of
the
proviso
which
is
rarely
looked
at
in
these
debates
is
reprinted.
and
if
we
will
mentally
block
out
two
words
from
the
proviso,
the
words
or
retention
for
the
moment,
we
have
this
left.
the
statutes
shall
not
impair
the
right
of
the
labor
organization
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
of
membership
therein.
now,
why
do
i
say
that
there's
a
violation
of
this
guarantee
if
we
have
violated
the
act
in
this
case?
it's
very
simple.
the
cardinal
rule
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
of
membership
in
this
union
is
that
you
shall
abide
by
the
union
norm
and
submit
the
union
discipline
if
you
go
in.
and
at
page
36
of
the
record
there
is
printed
the
--
this
actual
requirement
of
membership
which
is
then
duplicated
by
the
oath
of
membership,
but
it
says
expressly
that
every
applicants
shall
sign
upon
this
to
abide
by
all
laws,
rules
or
regulations
and
the
constitution
of
the
international
union.
and
therefore,
we
say
that
there
has
been
the
most
direct
violation
of
this
reserved
right
in
the
statute
if
now
we
can
no
longer
prescribe
the
rule
that
someone
who
comes
into
the
union
shall
support
a
strike
and
shall
submit
himself
to
traditional
union
discipline
if
he
fails
to
support
a
strike.
and
we
don't
believe
in
their
rules,
but
if
we're
going
to
have
it
we'd
say
that
we
ae
legally
within
this
proviso.
mr.
john
silard
it
should
obviously
be
read
to
mean
the
kinds
of
re
--
requirements
for
the
acquisition
of
membership
which
unions
have
traditionally
imposed,
and
this
is
the
most
traditional
of
all
that
has
ever
been
imposed.
if
you
join
the
union
you
support
the
strike,
and
you
submit
to
discipline
if
you
don't.
obviously,
it
all
limits
to
the
--
to
the
reading
of
every
word.
i'm
not
arguing
for
literalism
but
if
they're
going
to
have
it,
i'd
say
we
have
a
little
argument.
mr.
john
silard
and
we
believe
in
that
--
and
we
believe
in
street
now
and
we
believe
it
applies
under
national
labor
relations
act
as
well,
though
this
court
has
not
yet
so
held.
and
that
is
just
another
reason
why
the
choice
that
congress
made
in
1947
should
be
on
it.
the
choice
was
you
cannot
be
compelled
to
be
a
member
of
the
union,
but
if
you
are
a
union
member
then
you
must
march
with
the
union
as
unionists
always
have
because
it's
a
cause
which
requires
unanimity
and
concert
of
action,
and
not
at
the
loose
individualism
on
the
liberal
doctrine
questions
like
the
strike.
let
me
get
to
the
point
to
which
is
second
argument
is
that
there
is
an
election
by
the
union
members
to
which
he
can
be
held
when
he
joined.
this
court
has
long
ago
as
elgin,
joliet
held
that
a
union
member
may
validly
be
deemed
to
have
surrendered
to
the
union
his
contractual
and
statutory
right
with
respect
to
alleged
violations
of
his
contract
and
make
the
union
--
oe
validly
make
the
union
his
bargaining
agents
with
power
to
waive
away
and
bargain
away
and
settle
any
individual
agreements
of
his
own.
we
feel
that
the
election
that
this
court
permitted
in
elgin,
joliet
is
a
principle
which
can
be
applied
equally
here
that
one
who
chooses
to
join
the
union
since
1947
at
least,
one
who
chooses
to
--
to
join
the
union
when
he
not
need
the
union,
he
may
refrain
from
joining
must
be
held
to
the
union
norm.
now,
union
start
as
critical
in
this
setting
if
the
court
please.
in
1951
the
seventh
circuit
which
has
jurisdiction
in
wisconsin
where
this
case
arose,
was
presented
with
precisely
the
following
situation.
a
number
of
employees
said,
"here
are
our
union
dues
but
we
are
not
coming
to
the
meeting
to
take
the
oaths
of
membership".
and
the
labor
board
held
that
when
they
were
then
discharged
by
the
employer
for
nonpayment
of
dues
which
the
union
refused
to
take,
the
act
was
violated
because
it
exceeded
the
power
of
the
union
to
do
anything
more
than
to
require
them
to
pay
the
dues
and
requiring
the
oath
of
membership
was
not
committed
under
the
statute
and
no
employment
discipline
could
be
imposed
under
the
statute
for
failure
to
take
the
oath.
since
1951
as
this
court's
general
motors
decision
and
radio
officers
decisions
have
also
confirmed
therefore,
it
is
clear
that
no
one
must
join
the
union
on
paying
the
union
discipline.
and
therefore
we
say
there
is
no
longer
of
a
real
difference
in
the
case
such
before
this
court
and
another
case
that
might
be
here
where
there's
no
union
security
clause
at
all.
the
union
just
tells
any
member
who
decides
to
join
and
then
imposes
a
fine
on
him.
and
we
think
it'd
be
absolutely
idiosyncratic
to
presume
that
congress
meant
in
a
non-union
security
clause
situation
to
bar
unions
from
suspending
or
fining
or
otherwise
disciplining
their
members
or
officers
and
we
see
no
different
result
flowing
here
since
1947
when
compulsory
membership
was
barred
by
the
congress.
now
it
is
said
that
employees
do
not
know
that
they
need
not
join
the
union,
but
we
think
companies
like
allis-chalmers
which
has
fought
this
case
with
bigger
advice
employees
of
their
rights
with
respect
to
joining
the
union
or
not
joining
the
union.
furthermore,
president
brewster
of
the
united
automobile
workers
has
not
made
a
secret
of
the
fact
that
members
or
that
employees
need
not
join
the
union.
at
page
12
of
our
brief,
there's
a
lengthy
footnote
of
his
public
testimony
some
two
or
three
years
ago
categorically
affirming
that
no
one
needs
to
join
the
union
and
bind
himself
to
its
norm.
finally,
the
contract
here
itself
doesn't
require
union
membership
as
it
might
have
under
the
strict
readings
of
section
8
(a)
(3).
it
says,
"you
shall
be
a
member
of
the
union
to
the
extent
of
paying
monthly
dues
and
no
more".
so
we
think
that
the
argument
that
people
are
losing
their
rights
by
ignorance
has
some
way
than
some
other
context
but
not
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
silard
we
say
that
we
have
made
an
argument,
your
honor
please,
that
at
some
length
that
if
the
unions
may
not
use
their
disciplinary
procedures
over
those
who
insist
on
working
during
a
valid
strike,
they
also
may
not
use
their
disciplinary
procedures
in
against
those
who
insist
on
wildcat
and
we
think
that
adds
to
the
--
mr.
john
silard
we
can
fine
them
for
working
and
we
can
fine
them
for
not
working,
and
we
have
just
had
a
case
which
is
in
our
supplemental
brief
which
came
to
public
notoriety
here
last
week
in
mansfield,
ohio
where
the
whole
union
was
trustee
and
the
officers
were
from
removed
from
office
because
a
wildcat
strike
was
continuing.
and
we
said
--
mr.
john
silard
more
than
that
your
honor,
we
could
--
even
if
their
on
a
no-strike
clause.
mr.
john
silard
no
contract
had
yet
been
negotiated.
we
believe
that
our
constitution
permits
us
under
the
clear
provisions
on
this
to
fine
and
discipline
a
member
for
insisting
on
striking
without
the
full
authorization
of
the
union
and
the
international
for
insisting
on
striking
when
the
rest
of
majority
decides
to
work.
so
we
say
it
has
to
cut
both
ways
and
it's
in
an
added
idiosyncrasy
and
incongruity
if
unions
are
now
to
be
deprived
of
their
traditional
discipline
with
respect
to
the
strike,
whichever
way
it
goes.
i'm
not
going
to,
in
my
limited
time
bear
odd
on
the
third
point,
our
rule
of
reason
argument
which
we
have
briefed
in
full,
except
to
cite
one
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
at
page
39
of
our
brief.
there
is
a
reference
to
mirror
against
the
detroit
musicians.
and
i
think
it's
a
very
interesting
case
on
the
question
you
asked
the
--
the
solicitor
general.
there,
the
members
of
the
union
were
fined
$25
but
the
union
constitution
said
that
$10
was
the
maximum
fine.
the
court,
on
the
instance
of
the
fined
members,
ordered
the
fines
remitted
and
the
members
restored
to
full
status,
$15
more
than
the
maximum
of
ten
was
enough
to
invoke
the
usual
authority
of
the
common
law
courts
to
bar
any
sanction
against
the
member
who
had
in
fact
violated
the
constitution.
we
say
the
answer
to
your
questions
about
excessive
fines,
unreasonable
fines;
unreasonable
procedures
are
in
the
common
law
court.
and
the
non-enforceability
of
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested
of
the
union
norm
which
the
union
is
trying
to
enforce.
they
are
not
under
this
particular
statute.
i'd
like
now
to
turn
to
our
fourth
and
final
point,
american
ship
building.
we
do
really
believe
that
this
is
the
most
persuasive
of
all
our
points.
we
cannot
see
that
now
when
the
employer
may
deny
work
to
every
member
of
the
union
and
every
employee
as
a
bargaining
device.
as
a
bargaining
device
it
can
fairly
be
deemed
the
congress
--
for
congress
at
the
same
time
to
have
said
in
the
statute
that
unions
may
not
even
with
respect
to
their
own
members
enforce
a
concerted
work
stoppage.
why?
we
would
say,
should
the
employer
be
able
at
his
option
to
enforce
--
to
deny
work
to
all
of
the
workers
in
the
plant
as
a
bargaining
device
to
chastise
the
union,
but
now
the
union
without
congress
ever
having
expressly
said
so
is
to
be
denied
the
right
to
have
an
effective
concerted
strike
even
by
its
own
members.
we
say
as
this
court
said
in
curtis
brothers
in
the
last
sentence
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion,
the
cardinal
principle
in
construing
the
statute
is
we
need
a
coherent
national
labor
policy.
this
should
be
a
non-coherent
national
labor
policy
giving
to
the
employer
the
traditional
union
weapon
of
the
concerted
strike
and
now
taking
it
away
from
the
union
which
you
always
had
it,
by
the
way
that
the
employer
has
gained
it
fairly
recently
only.
i
want
to
say
one
last
thing
about
the
basic
question
before
this
court.
in
1947,
congress
was
presented
with
a
difficult
choice.
the
dual
rigors
of
union
allegiance
and
compulsory
union
membership
were
deemed
by
the
congress
to
go
too
far.
congress
had
a
choice.
it
could've
gotten
into
the
internal
network
of
union
allegiance
and
union
norms
and
sought
to
deal
with
the
problem
there.
it
rejected
that
choice.
instead,
in
1947
congress
said,
"the
part
of
this
equation
we
will
effect
is
compulsory
union
membership".
what
we're
going
to
do
henceforth
is
to
knock
out
the
close
shop
of
any
more
compulsion
than
the
payment
of
support
moneys
to
the
union.
that's
the
choice
that
congress
made.
instead
of
interfering
with
the
internal
options
of
the
union
its
solidarity
and
its
strength
in
situations
like
the
strike,
what
the
congress
said
was,
"we'll
start
on
this
other
side
of
the
equation
and
we're
going
to
say
that
compulsory
unionism
must
go".
now,
we
say
this
is
a
delicate
balance
between
four
competing
rights,
the
public's
rights,
the
employer's
rights,
the
union's
rights
and
the
individual
workers
rights.
that
delicate
balance
cannot
possibly,
in
our
opinion,
be
upset
by
the
meat
cleaver
which
the
majority
of
the
seventh
circuit
employed
on
this
sensitive
question.
it's
a
wholesale
rewriting
of
the
statute
we
say.
now,
to
squeeze
into
the
1947
statute
rather
than
the
landrum-griffin
act,
which
really
dealt
with
the
problem
of
union's
relationship
to
its
own
members,
to
squeeze
within
the
interest
of
this
1947
statute
these
rigorous
limitations
you
may
no
longer
have
strike
solidarity
enforceable
by
a
$20
or
$100
fining.
you
can't
go
to
court
to
enforce
your
contract
rights
with
your
own
members.
this
we
say
goes
too
far.
the
right
equation
was
the
one
that
congress
struck.
compulsory
membership
is
barred
but
the
union
strength,
solidarity
and
internal
allegiance
rules
are
left
intact
and
enforceable
until
congress
acts,
we
say
it
is
not
for
the
courts
to
upset
that
delicate
balance.
mr.
john
silard
to
force
them
not
to
work,
your
honor?
mr.
john
silard
well
--
mr.
john
silard
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
--
the
answer
to
that
question
may
have
to
wait
the
answer
to
the
question
that's
here,
because
if
--
mr.
john
silard
--
if
they'll
--
mr.
john
silard
i
think
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
categorically
that
there
might
not
be
a
defense,
but
i
would
say
that
if
one
of
the
lines
of
--
if
there
are
number
or
arguments
before
the
court,
on
which
this
decision
concur.
if
it
turned
on
the
--
on
the
8
(b)
(1)
issue,
i'd
like
very
well
to
say
no
because
section
7
right
in
that
case
might
still
be
in
fact
even
though
8
(b)
(1)
doesn't
reach
this
particular
right
to
work
rather
than
to
strike.
then
you
would
say
common
law
courts
are
preempted
from
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
an
effort
to
enjoin
a
kind
of
activity
which
section
7
protects
even
though
no
8
(b)
(1)
sanction
attaches
to
it.
if
on
the
other
hand,
our
argument
that
there's
been
an
election
of
waiver
of
section
7
by
the
member
of
the
union
were
to
be
the
one
that
this
court
rather
adopt,
i
would
say
that
then
you
might
in
fact
be
presented
with
a
situation
where
there's
no
room
for
a
preemption
argument
anymore
just
as
in
elgin
joliet,
i
think
they
were
statutory
--
mr.
john
silard
now,
congress
meant
to
leave
fines
and
discipline
within
the
ambit
of
the
union's
discretion,
and
the
power
of
the
common
law
courts
to
--
to
control.
and
that
power
has
been
used
in
--
with
great
rigor,
i
may
so
mr.
justice
white,
to
affect
every
single
jot
and
title
of
the
union's
disciplinary
action.
$15
is
too
much,
if
$10
--
if
$10
is
what
your
constitution
prescribes.
if
the
norm
you're
enforcing
is
not
expressly
in
your
constitution,
the
courts
will
set
aside
any
discipline.
if
the
procedures
are
not
--
mr.
john
silard
no,
literally
read,
our
constitution
permits
no
more
than
$100
day
--
$100
a
day,
page
37
of
the
record.
mr.
john
silard
no,
it
permits
no
more
than
$100
against
any
charged
member,
and
we
have
found
not
a
single
case
anywhere,
never
mind
in
our
own
union
in
which
this
theory
which
one
of
the
two
locals
in
this
case
misguidedly
suggest
but
then
it
really
only
suggested
it.
that
they
always
use
the
word
may,
it
didn't
say
you're
going
to
be
fined
$100.
there
was
--
somebody
thought
it
up
and
wasn't
sure
about
it,
but
the
most
that
one
of
these
two
unions
said
was
maybe
you
can
made
to
be
--
made
to
pay
$100
a
day,
but
people
who
work
to
six
weeks
they're
still
fined
only
$100
in
total.
and
that's
where
our
union
constitution
is
always
rigorously
set
as
the
maximum
against
an
offender.
not
for
one
day
the
one
hour
of
offend
--
offending.
mr.
john
silard
it
needn't
be
that
way
--
mr.
john
silard
--
there
have
been
cases
in
which
very
large
fines
have
been
set
and
there
are
cases
in
the
courts
in
which
such
fines,
not
only
are
not
enforced,
but
in
which
members
who
are
suspended
or
discharged
from
the
union
for
not
paying
such
fines
have
been
reinstated
by
the
common
law
courts
on
the
ground
that
property
and
contract
rights
were
involved
and
that
courts
could
take
protective
action.
thank
you.
mr.
john
silard
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
union,
we
have
the
temerity
to
suggest
that
there
are
really
four
separate
and
conclusive
reasons
why
we
have
--
the
union
has
not
violated
the
statute.
the
first
is
that
union
discipline
of
members
is
exempted
from
the
labor
board's
jurisdiction
by
the
text
on
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
its
proviso.
the
second
reason
is
that
in
section
7
of
the
act,
every
employee
has
the
choice
of
abstention
from
or
participation
in
concerted
protected
activity,
but
once
the
worker
chooses
to
join
the
union,
he
is
bound
to
his
election
of
participation
over
former
statutory
right
of
abstention.
thirdly
--
mr.
john
silard
mr.
justice
white,
the
common
law
courts
have
given
relief
in
that
situation
for
about
a
hundred
years
and
they
have
been
very
rigorous
and
we
cite
many
cases.
i
will
get
to
this.
mr.
john
silard
where
any
exceeding
of
the
union's
constitutional
powers
and
the
norm
that's
applied
in
the
fairness
of
the
procedures
is
grounds,
not
only
for
setting
aside
fines,
but
for
setting
aside
suspensions
and
expulsions.
and
we
would
not
stand
here
to
defend
--
mr.
john
silard
there
could
be
no
fine
which
the
courts
--
the
common
law
courts
would
enforce
under
any
property
or
con
--
contract
theory
whether
you
would
have
a
violation
of
the
statute
here,
there's
a
different
question
that
i
would
say
not,
and
i
will
get
to
that
if
you
permit
it.
in
a
moment
i
would
like
to
outline
my
four
points
and
then
i'll
certainly
will
cover
this
--
this
question.
we
would
urge
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
statute,
even
if
the
--
the
unreasonableness
in
the
enforcement
of
the
internal
union
rules,
procedural
or
otherwise,
may
be
a
basis
of
a
landrum-griffin,
a
griffin
violation
it
is,
it's
a
procedural
violation
but
not
nlra
violation.
the
third
ground
upon
which
we
believe
this
labor
board's
decision
in
this
case
was
right,
is
that
there
must
be
some
rule
of
reason
in
the
application
of
the
restraint
or
coerce
clause.
there's
been
a
rule
of
reason
in
the
restraint
clause
of
the
sherman
act
for
many
years.
we
see
no
reason
for
denying
one
here,
and
if
there's
any
rule
of
reason
in
what
constitute
restraint
or
coercion
under
this
statutory
clause,
we
are
within
the
most
reasonableness
of
all
the
rules.
and
fourth,
and
perhaps
the
most
important
point
we
would
make
is
this.
this
court
in
american
ship
building
rules
that
the
employer
can
enforce
a
concerted
work
refusal
on
every
member
of
the
union
and
every
employee
as
a
bargaining
device.
and
the
statute
becomes
incongruous
and
imbalanced
if
now
labor
unions
can
no
longer
enforce
a
concerted
work
refusal
even
on
their
own
members.
the
traditional
strike
weapon
has
then
been
taken
from
the
unions
and
given
to
the
employer.
mr.
john
silard
i
say
--
i
say
the
--
the
american
ship
held
that
the
employer
can
invade
the
right
to
work
under
section
7
of
every
single
one
of
his
employees
as
a
warning
device
if
he
decides
to
lock
them
out,
he
--
a
concerted
work
stoppage
denial
of
the
right
to
work.
we
say
the
imbalance
here
is
created
if
the
employer
can
lockout
all
the
workers
and
deny
them
work,
as
a
--
as
a
bargaining
device
now,
but
the
union
can
no
longer
affect
the
--
a
work
stoppage
even
by
its
own
members
who
have
pledged
that
they
would
abide
by
the
union
norms.
it's
an
imbalance
and
then
an
incongruity
which
we
would
say
should
be
resisted.
mr.
john
silard
well,
the
section
7
would
give
the
employees
all
of
the
right
not
to
engage
in
a
concerted
work
refusal,
and
prior
to
american
ship,
that
were
meant
not
to
be
made
parties
to
a
consider
work
refusal
whether
initiated
by
the
union,
by
a
strike
or
by
the
employer
by
a
lockout.
let
me
get
that
in
a
moment.
and
i
--
and
i
say
this
to
mr.
justice
brennan
literalism
in
the
construction
of
this
statute
is
a
trap.
and
we
think
if
we're
going
to
have
literalism,
the
company
has
fallen
into
the
trap
because
we
believe
we
are
literally
excluded
by
the
proviso
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
from
the
coverage
of
8
section
(b)
(1)
itself.
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
by
looking
at
page
3
of
the
blue
brief,
at
the
very
top,
the
actual
text
of
the
proviso
which
is
rarely
looked
at
in
these
debates
is
reprinted.
and
if
we
will
mentally
block
out
two
words
from
the
proviso,
the
words
or
retention
for
the
moment,
we
have
this
left.
the
statutes
shall
not
impair
the
right
of
the
labor
organization
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
of
membership
therein.
now,
why
do
i
say
that
there's
a
violation
of
this
guarantee
if
we
have
violated
the
act
in
this
case?
it's
very
simple.
the
cardinal
rule
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
of
membership
in
this
union
is
that
you
shall
abide
by
the
union
norm
and
submit
the
union
discipline
if
you
go
in.
and
at
page
36
of
the
record
there
is
printed
the
--
this
actual
requirement
of
membership
which
is
then
duplicated
by
the
oath
of
membership,
but
it
says
expressly
that
every
applicants
shall
sign
upon
this
to
abide
by
all
laws,
rules
or
regulations
and
the
constitution
of
the
international
union.
and
therefore,
we
say
that
there
has
been
the
most
direct
violation
of
this
reserved
right
in
the
statute
if
now
we
can
no
longer
prescribe
the
rule
that
someone
who
comes
into
the
union
shall
support
a
strike
and
shall
submit
himself
to
traditional
union
discipline
if
he
fails
to
support
a
strike.
and
we
don't
believe
in
their
rules,
but
if
we're
going
to
have
it
we'd
say
that
we
ae
legally
within
this
proviso.
mr.
john
silard
it
should
obviously
be
read
to
mean
the
kinds
of
re
--
requirements
for
the
acquisition
of
membership
which
unions
have
traditionally
imposed,
and
this
is
the
most
traditional
of
all
that
has
ever
been
imposed.
if
you
join
the
union
you
support
the
strike,
and
you
submit
to
discipline
if
you
don't.
obviously,
it
all
limits
to
the
--
to
the
reading
of
every
word.
i'm
not
arguing
for
literalism
but
if
they're
going
to
have
it,
i'd
say
we
have
a
little
argument.
mr.
john
silard
and
we
believe
in
that
--
and
we
believe
in
street
now
and
we
believe
it
applies
under
national
labor
relations
act
as
well,
though
this
court
has
not
yet
so
held.
and
that
is
just
another
reason
why
the
choice
that
congress
made
in
1947
should
be
on
it.
the
choice
was
you
cannot
be
compelled
to
be
a
member
of
the
union,
but
if
you
are
a
union
member
then
you
must
march
with
the
union
as
unionists
always
have
because
it's
a
cause
which
requires
unanimity
and
concert
of
action,
and
not
at
the
loose
individualism
on
the
liberal
doctrine
questions
like
the
strike.
let
me
get
to
the
point
to
which
is
second
argument
is
that
there
is
an
election
by
the
union
members
to
which
he
can
be
held
when
he
joined.
this
court
has
long
ago
as
elgin,
joliet
held
that
a
union
member
may
validly
be
deemed
to
have
surrendered
to
the
union
his
contractual
and
statutory
right
with
respect
to
alleged
violations
of
his
contract
and
make
the
union
--
oe
validly
make
the
union
his
bargaining
agents
with
power
to
waive
away
and
bargain
away
and
settle
any
individual
agreements
of
his
own.
we
feel
that
the
election
that
this
court
permitted
in
elgin,
joliet
is
a
principle
which
can
be
applied
equally
here
that
one
who
chooses
to
join
the
union
since
1947
at
least,
one
who
chooses
to
--
to
join
the
union
when
he
not
need
the
union,
he
may
refrain
from
joining
must
be
held
to
the
union
norm.
now,
union
start
as
critical
in
this
setting
if
the
court
please.
in
1951
the
seventh
circuit
which
has
jurisdiction
in
wisconsin
where
this
case
arose,
was
presented
with
precisely
the
following
situation.
a
number
of
employees
said,
"here
are
our
union
dues
but
we
are
not
coming
to
the
meeting
to
take
the
oaths
of
membership".
and
the
labor
board
held
that
when
they
were
then
discharged
by
the
employer
for
nonpayment
of
dues
which
the
union
refused
to
take,
the
act
was
violated
because
it
exceeded
the
power
of
the
union
to
do
anything
more
than
to
require
them
to
pay
the
dues
and
requiring
the
oath
of
membership
was
not
committed
under
the
statute
and
no
employment
discipline
could
be
imposed
under
the
statute
for
failure
to
take
the
oath.
since
1951
as
this
court's
general
motors
decision
and
radio
officers
decisions
have
also
confirmed
therefore,
it
is
clear
that
no
one
must
join
the
union
on
paying
the
union
discipline.
and
therefore
we
say
there
is
no
longer
of
a
real
difference
in
the
case
such
before
this
court
and
another
case
that
might
be
here
where
there's
no
union
security
clause
at
all.
the
union
just
tells
any
member
who
decides
to
join
and
then
imposes
a
fine
on
him.
and
we
think
it'd
be
absolutely
idiosyncratic
to
presume
that
congress
meant
in
a
non-union
security
clause
situation
to
bar
unions
from
suspending
or
fining
or
otherwise
disciplining
their
members
or
officers
and
we
see
no
different
result
flowing
here
since
1947
when
compulsory
membership
was
barred
by
the
congress.
now
it
is
said
that
employees
do
not
know
that
they
need
not
join
the
union,
but
we
think
companies
like
allis-chalmers
which
has
fought
this
case
with
bigger
advice
employees
of
their
rights
with
respect
to
joining
the
union
or
not
joining
the
union.
furthermore,
president
brewster
of
the
united
automobile
workers
has
not
made
a
secret
of
the
fact
that
members
or
that
employees
need
not
join
the
union.
at
page
12
of
our
brief,
there's
a
lengthy
footnote
of
his
public
testimony
some
two
or
three
years
ago
categorically
affirming
that
no
one
needs
to
join
the
union
and
bind
himself
to
its
norm.
finally,
the
contract
here
itself
doesn't
require
union
membership
as
it
might
have
under
the
strict
readings
of
section
8
(a)
(3).
it
says,
"you
shall
be
a
member
of
the
union
to
the
extent
of
paying
monthly
dues
and
no
more".
so
we
think
that
the
argument
that
people
are
losing
their
rights
by
ignorance
has
some
way
than
some
other
context
but
not
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
silard
we
say
that
we
have
made
an
argument,
your
honor
please,
that
at
some
length
that
if
the
unions
may
not
use
their
disciplinary
procedures
over
those
who
insist
on
working
during
a
valid
strike,
they
also
may
not
use
their
disciplinary
procedures
in
against
those
who
insist
on
wildcat
and
we
think
that
adds
to
the
--
mr.
john
silard
we
can
fine
them
for
working
and
we
can
fine
them
for
not
working,
and
we
have
just
had
a
case
which
is
in
our
supplemental
brief
which
came
to
public
notoriety
here
last
week
in
mansfield,
ohio
where
the
whole
union
was
trustee
and
the
officers
were
from
removed
from
office
because
a
wildcat
strike
was
continuing.
and
we
said
--
mr.
john
silard
more
than
that
your
honor,
we
could
--
even
if
their
on
a
no-strike
clause.
mr.
john
silard
no
contract
had
yet
been
negotiated.
we
believe
that
our
constitution
permits
us
under
the
clear
provisions
on
this
to
fine
and
discipline
a
member
for
insisting
on
striking
without
the
full
authorization
of
the
union
and
the
international
for
insisting
on
striking
when
the
rest
of
majority
decides
to
work.
so
we
say
it
has
to
cut
both
ways
and
it's
in
an
added
idiosyncrasy
and
incongruity
if
unions
are
now
to
be
deprived
of
their
traditional
discipline
with
respect
to
the
strike,
whichever
way
it
goes.
i'm
not
going
to,
in
my
limited
time
bear
odd
on
the
third
point,
our
rule
of
reason
argument
which
we
have
briefed
in
full,
except
to
cite
one
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
at
page
39
of
our
brief.
there
is
a
reference
to
mirror
against
the
detroit
musicians.
and
i
think
it's
a
very
interesting
case
on
the
question
you
asked
the
--
the
solicitor
general.
there,
the
members
of
the
union
were
fined
$25
but
the
union
constitution
said
that
$10
was
the
maximum
fine.
the
court,
on
the
instance
of
the
fined
members,
ordered
the
fines
remitted
and
the
members
restored
to
full
status,
$15
more
than
the
maximum
of
ten
was
enough
to
invoke
the
usual
authority
of
the
common
law
courts
to
bar
any
sanction
against
the
member
who
had
in
fact
violated
the
constitution.
we
say
the
answer
to
your
questions
about
excessive
fines,
unreasonable
fines;
unreasonable
procedures
are
in
the
common
law
court.
and
the
non-enforceability
of
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested
of
the
union
norm
which
the
union
is
trying
to
enforce.
they
are
not
under
this
particular
statute.
i'd
like
now
to
turn
to
our
fourth
and
final
point,
american
ship
building.
we
do
really
believe
that
this
is
the
most
persuasive
of
all
our
points.
we
cannot
see
that
now
when
the
employer
may
deny
work
to
every
member
of
the
union
and
every
employee
as
a
bargaining
device.
as
a
bargaining
device
it
can
fairly
be
deemed
the
congress
--
for
congress
at
the
same
time
to
have
said
in
the
statute
that
unions
may
not
even
with
respect
to
their
own
members
enforce
a
concerted
work
stoppage.
why?
we
would
say,
should
the
employer
be
able
at
his
option
to
enforce
--
to
deny
work
to
all
of
the
workers
in
the
plant
as
a
bargaining
device
to
chastise
the
union,
but
now
the
union
without
congress
ever
having
expressly
said
so
is
to
be
denied
the
right
to
have
an
effective
concerted
strike
even
by
its
own
members.
we
say
as
this
court
said
in
curtis
brothers
in
the
last
sentence
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion,
the
cardinal
principle
in
construing
the
statute
is
we
need
a
coherent
national
labor
policy.
this
should
be
a
non-coherent
national
labor
policy
giving
to
the
employer
the
traditional
union
weapon
of
the
concerted
strike
and
now
taking
it
away
from
the
union
which
you
always
had
it,
by
the
way
that
the
employer
has
gained
it
fairly
recently
only.
i
want
to
say
one
last
thing
about
the
basic
question
before
this
court.
in
1947,
congress
was
presented
with
a
difficult
choice.
the
dual
rigors
of
union
allegiance
and
compulsory
union
membership
were
deemed
by
the
congress
to
go
too
far.
congress
had
a
choice.
it
could've
gotten
into
the
internal
network
of
union
allegiance
and
union
norms
and
sought
to
deal
with
the
problem
there.
it
rejected
that
choice.
instead,
in
1947
congress
said,
"the
part
of
this
equation
we
will
effect
is
compulsory
union
membership".
what
we're
going
to
do
henceforth
is
to
knock
out
the
close
shop
of
any
more
compulsion
than
the
payment
of
support
moneys
to
the
union.
that's
the
choice
that
congress
made.
instead
of
interfering
with
the
internal
options
of
the
union
its
solidarity
and
its
strength
in
situations
like
the
strike,
what
the
congress
said
was,
"we'll
start
on
this
other
side
of
the
equation
and
we're
going
to
say
that
compulsory
unionism
must
go".
now,
we
say
this
is
a
delicate
balance
between
four
competing
rights,
the
public's
rights,
the
employer's
rights,
the
union's
rights
and
the
individual
workers
rights.
that
delicate
balance
cannot
possibly,
in
our
opinion,
be
upset
by
the
meat
cleaver
which
the
majority
of
the
seventh
circuit
employed
on
this
sensitive
question.
it's
a
wholesale
rewriting
of
the
statute
we
say.
now,
to
squeeze
into
the
1947
statute
rather
than
the
landrum-griffin
act,
which
really
dealt
with
the
problem
of
union's
relationship
to
its
own
members,
to
squeeze
within
the
interest
of
this
1947
statute
these
rigorous
limitations
you
may
no
longer
have
strike
solidarity
enforceable
by
a
$20
or
$100
fining.
you
can't
go
to
court
to
enforce
your
contract
rights
with
your
own
members.
this
we
say
goes
too
far.
the
right
equation
was
the
one
that
congress
struck.
compulsory
membership
is
barred
but
the
union
strength,
solidarity
and
internal
allegiance
rules
are
left
intact
and
enforceable
until
congress
acts,
we
say
it
is
not
for
the
courts
to
upset
that
delicate
balance.
mr.
john
silard
to
force
them
not
to
work,
your
honor?
mr.
john
silard
well
--
mr.
john
silard
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
--
the
answer
to
that
question
may
have
to
wait
the
answer
to
the
question
that's
here,
because
if
--
mr.
john
silard
--
if
they'll
--
mr.
john
silard
i
think
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
categorically
that
there
might
not
be
a
defense,
but
i
would
say
that
if
one
of
the
lines
of
--
if
there
are
number
or
arguments
before
the
court,
on
which
this
decision
concur.
if
it
turned
on
the
--
on
the
8
(b)
(1)
issue,
i'd
like
very
well
to
say
no
because
section
7
right
in
that
case
might
still
be
in
fact
even
though
8
(b)
(1)
doesn't
reach
this
particular
right
to
work
rather
than
to
strike.
then
you
would
say
common
law
courts
are
preempted
from
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
an
effort
to
enjoin
a
kind
of
activity
which
section
7
protects
even
though
no
8
(b)
(1)
sanction
attaches
to
it.
if
on
the
other
hand,
our
argument
that
there's
been
an
election
of
waiver
of
section
7
by
the
member
of
the
union
were
to
be
the
one
that
this
court
rather
adopt,
i
would
say
that
then
you
might
in
fact
be
presented
with
a
situation
where
there's
no
room
for
a
preemption
argument
anymore
just
as
in
elgin
joliet,
i
think
they
were
statutory
--
mr.
john
silard
now,
congress
meant
to
leave
fines
and
discipline
within
the
ambit
of
the
union's
discretion,
and
the
power
of
the
common
law
courts
to
--
to
control.
and
that
power
has
been
used
in
--
with
great
rigor,
i
may
so
mr.
justice
white,
to
affect
every
single
jot
and
title
of
the
union's
disciplinary
action.
$15
is
too
much,
if
$10
--
if
$10
is
what
your
constitution
prescribes.
if
the
norm
you're
enforcing
is
not
expressly
in
your
constitution,
the
courts
will
set
aside
any
discipline.
if
the
procedures
are
not
--
mr.
john
silard
no,
literally
read,
our
constitution
permits
no
more
than
$100
day
--
$100
a
day,
page
37
of
the
record.
mr.
john
silard
no,
it
permits
no
more
than
$100
against
any
charged
member,
and
we
have
found
not
a
single
case
anywhere,
never
mind
in
our
own
union
in
which
this
theory
which
one
of
the
two
locals
in
this
case
misguidedly
suggest
but
then
it
really
only
suggested
it.
that
they
always
use
the
word
may,
it
didn't
say
you're
going
to
be
fined
$100.
there
was
--
somebody
thought
it
up
and
wasn't
sure
about
it,
but
the
most
that
one
of
these
two
unions
said
was
maybe
you
can
made
to
be
--
made
to
pay
$100
a
day,
but
people
who
work
to
six
weeks
they're
still
fined
only
$100
in
total.
and
that's
where
our
union
constitution
is
always
rigorously
set
as
the
maximum
against
an
offender.
not
for
one
day
the
one
hour
of
offend
--
offending.
mr.
john
silard
it
needn't
be
that
way
--
mr.
john
silard
--
there
have
been
cases
in
which
very
large
fines
have
been
set
and
there
are
cases
in
the
courts
in
which
such
fines,
not
only
are
not
enforced,
but
in
which
members
who
are
suspended
or
discharged
from
the
union
for
not
paying
such
fines
have
been
reinstated
by
the
common
law
courts
on
the
ground
that
property
and
contract
rights
were
involved
and
that
courts
could
take
protective
action.
thank
you.
