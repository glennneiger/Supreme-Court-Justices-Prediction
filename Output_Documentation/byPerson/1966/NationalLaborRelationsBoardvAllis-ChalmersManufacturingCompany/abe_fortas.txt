justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
wonder
if
the
issue
might
be
stated
a
little
differently.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
questions
here,
one
whether
the
union
can
impose
and
collect
a
fine
and
that's
being
litigated
in
the
state
courts.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
assuming
that
the
union
can
not
--
doesn't
have
the
power,
as
determined
by
the
wisconsin
courts,
say
to
levy
and
collect
the
fine,
and
this
whole
matter
is
disposed
off,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
and
now
let
us
assume
on
the
other
hand
that
the
wisconsin
courts
determine
or
that
it's
finally
determined
that
the
union
does
have
this
right
to
assess
and
collect
fines
as
a
matter
of
contract
law
whatever
it
may
be.
and
the
next
question
is
whether
the
union
may
exercise
if
this
contractual
right
has
against
its
members
without
being
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
only
way
they
coerce
here
is
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
they
didn't
try
to
coerce
by
beating
a
fellow
out,
but
trying
to
coerce
him
in
a
sense,
if
you
want
to
use
that
word,
by
going
into
court
and
standing
a
lawsuit,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
not
coercion
in
terms
of
beating
them
up
or
firing
them
from
the
union.
they
went
into
court
and
said,
"we've
got
a
legal
right
to
collect
these
fines".
and
that's
being
litigated.
now,
if
you
assume
that
the
court
say
that's
right,
you
have
a
legal
right
to
collect
these
fines,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
union's
exercise
of
that
presumed
legal
right
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
what
you
mean
by
the
phrase
in
your
brief
compulsory
labor
membership?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
that
people
not
knowing
that
they
don't
have
to
join
the
union
joined
anyway?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
it
comes
down
then?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
really
before
us
now,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
perhaps
justice
douglas
did
inquire
it
is
that
this
is
not
really
a
matter
of
the
union
membership
who
fines
applicable
to
people
who
voluntarily
join
unions
because
there
are
some
other
people
like
these
times
--
new
york
times
advertising
salesman,
whoever
is
involved
here,
who
sort
of
inadvertently
and
lack
of
knowing
any
better,
seduced
him
to
join
the
union,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
that
might
be
a
defense
--
that
might
be
a
defense
in
the
action
to
collect
a
fine.
why
is
that
relevant
to
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
section
7
protected
the
right
not
to
work
as
well
as
the
right
to
work.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
not?
why
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
here
the
labor
--
labor
union
though
says,
"alright
fellows,
we're
going
--
we're
not
going
to
enter
in
the
bargaining
agreement,
we're
going
out
on
strike".
now,
your
reasoning
with
respect
to
the
wildcat
situation
depended
upon
the
fact
that
the
union
is
the
exclusive
bargaining
agency.
now,
doesn't
that
hold
equally
where
the
union
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agency
says,
"we're
not
going
to
make
a
contract,
we're
going
out
on
strike".
and
what's
the
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
justice
white
has
asked
you.
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
get
there,
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
suppose
that
the
wisconsin
courts
hold
that
the
union
may
not
collect
this
fine,
would
you
still
believe
that
you
have
a
labor
board
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well
apparently,
somebody
believes
it's
worth
litigating.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
about
my
question
to
you?
suppose
after
wisconsin
courts
should
hold
that
the
fines
here
are
not
collectable?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
still
believe
that
you
had
a
labor
board
unfair
practice?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
position
then
is
that
even
if
the
labor
union
has
no
power,
no
right
to
levy
a
fine,
if
the
labor
union
merely
talks
about
levying
a
fine
that
that's
an
unfair
labor
practice.
