mr.
howard
c.
equitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
address
myself
first
to
the
last
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
in
order
to
explain
what
the
significance
of
any
union
authority
to
impose
discipline
in
a
so-called
wildcat
situation
is
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
a
union
would
have
authority
over
employees
only
if
they
were
members.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
it
may
be
in
a
situation
where
there
was
an
exclusive,
even
where
there
was
an
exclusive
agency
that
not
all
the
employees
in
the
unit
may
be
members.
so
we
concern
ourselves
first
only
with
that
group.
it
is
from
the
membership
relationship
that
any
authority
which
does
exist
arises.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
we
are
speaking
now
of
members.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
question
then
whether
the
union
may
take
action
is
in
two
parts.
they
may
do
so
if
authority
of
this
type
arises
out
of
the
membership
relationship,
and
this
is
a
question
of
common
law.
in
many
common
law
jurisdictions
or
in
the
common
law
in
many
jurisdictions,
the
right
of
the
union
to
have
certain
disciplinary
authorities
over
its
membership
has
been
recognized
over
the
years.
now,
the
question
whether
in
a
particular
instance
the
union
may
impose
a
fine
which
is
the
specific
subject
of
discussion
here
would
depend
upon
whether
there
is
some
other
law
forbidding
it
and
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
question
is
would
the
imposition
of
such
a
fine
violate
the
statute?
the
answer
is
no,
because
wildcat
activity
is
not
a
section
7
protected
right
and
therefore
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
which
forbids
coercions
of
the
exercise
of
those
rights
simply
does
not
apply.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
if
the
court
please,
the
distinction
is
this.
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
this
act
in
1947,
it
had
already
become
established
under
section
7
of
the
wagner
act
that
unauthorized
strike
activity
was
not
an
action
of
a
concerted
bargaining
activity
through
a
representative
of
the
employee's
choosing.
this
is
the
only
kind
of
activity
which
section
7
concerns
itself
with
at
all.
in
the
house
bill,
it
was
proposed
that
there'd
be
some
references
to
the
authority
of
unions
in
wildcat
strike
situations.
this
was
expressly
not
included
in
the
act
as
passed
and
the
conference
report
explicitly
states
this
because
it
was
already
established
that
it
was
not
the
concern
of
either
--
it
had
not
been
the
concern
of
the
wagner
act
and
it
was
not
being
the
concern
of
the
taft-hartley
act
to
cover
activities
that
were
not
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
thank
you,
your
honor.
to
--
finally
to
dispose
of
this
question
which
the
respondent
looks
on
as
a
spurious
comparison
of
the
question
of
union
authority
with
respect
to
wildcatting
in
relationship
to
union
authority
if
any,
in
the
case
of
employees
who
desire
to
work
during
a
strike,
i
would
like
to
make
just
two
citation
references.
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
labor
relations
act
of
1947,
at
pages
542
to
543
with
copious
citations
to
the
law
as
it
had
developed
under
the
wagner
act,
it
is
explicit
that
wildcatting
or
unauthorized
strike
activity
is
simply
not
a
subject
of
the
coverage
of
the
section
7
of
the
act.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
your
honor
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
where
there
is
an
established
bargaining
agency,
the
right
that
employees
have
is
to
pursue
affirmatively
collective
bargaining
activity
only
through
that
bargaining
agency.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well,
the
other
proposition
is
not
the
reverse
of
that
proposition.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
reason
for
it
is
this.
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
law
and
it
was
the
primary
concern
of
the
congress
to
pass
this
law
to
minimize
interruptions
to
commerce.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
striking
does
this.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
it
does
not
hold
to
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
it
does
not
hold
true
because
it
was
so
plainly
the
reason
for
protection
that
employees
be
given
a
choice
whether
to
participate
in
or
to
refrain
from
participating
in
concerted
union
activities
that
the
law
was
drafted
with
that
purpose
precisely.
they
do
have
that
right
and
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
it
says
concerted
activity
or
collective
bargaining
activity
through
representatives
of
the
choo
--
choosing
of
the
employees,
i
believe
is
the
full
text
of
section
7.
the
other
references
that
i
would
make
to
the
legislative
history
are
those
which
are
cited
at
pages
16
and
17
of
the
respondent's
brief
which
could
not
be
more
explicit.
for
example,
on
page
16,
senator
taft,
the
principal
proponent
of
this
legislation
and
sponsor
of
it
in
the
senate
stated
explicitly
in
his
analysis
of
the
act
as
passed,
and
i
quote,
"the
prohibition
contained
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
applies
to
coercive
acts
of
unions
against
employees
who
did
not
wish
to
join
or
did
not
care
to
participate
in
a
strike
or
a
picket
line".
this
language
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
not
with
respect
to
the
right
of
employees
to
refrain
from
collective
bargaining
activity.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well
then
perhaps
there
can
be
one
only
with
respect
--
it
would
have
significance
only
with
respect
to
the
employees
exposing
themselves
to
employer
action.
if
there
is
no
bargaining
agent
then
there
is
no
question
of
the
employees
engaging
in
collective
bargaining
through
representatives
of
their
choosing.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
no,
that
is
not
correct.
he
loses
his
right
not
to
go
to
work
if
the
union
has
not
declared
a
strike.
this
is
--
it's
true,
it's
difficult
to
express
this
but
that
is
the
analysis
of
this
that
the
respondent
would
make.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
that
is,
i
think,
a
fair
way
of
expressing
it.
now,
the
facts
are
substantially
as
the
solicitor
outlined
them.
there
are,
however
an
aspect
or
two,
of
the
facts
which
deserve
some
notice.
first
of
all,
there
has
been,
in
view
of
the
respondent,
an
undue
concentration
and
again
a
spurious
one,
on
the
precise
amount
of
the
fine
which
ultimately
came
to
be
imposed.
i
think
the
simple
response
to
this
is
that
it
is
undisputed.
the
threat
was
of
a
fine
for
each
offense
of
working
during
the
progress
of
the
strike
and
it
was
explicit
in
the
threat
that
each
day
could
constitute
a
separate
such
offense.
i
think
it's
an
elementary
proposition
that
the
scope
of
--
it
is
the
scope
of
a
threat
which
is
relevant
to
coercion.
some
employees
did
work
during
the
strike.
there
has
been
some
concentration
on
the
relative
proportion
of
those
who
did
contrasted
with
those
who
did
not.
but
we
must
remember
that
this
strike
occurred
in
the
context
of
defined
threat
and
in
that
context,
the
respondent
believes
that
it
is
frankly
surprising
that
there
were
not
more
who
did
so.
it
is
not
surprising
that
there
were
not
more
who
did
so.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
right
--
there
might
be
a
question
of
this
kind.
as
i
outlined
in
the
case
of
the
distinction
between
an
unauthorized
strike
and
the
refraining
from
a
strike
which
is
authorized,
the
right
that
employees
have
is
to
refrain
from
certain
activities,
certain
union
activities.
if
an
employee
were
affirmatively
to
participate
in
a
counter
union
activity,
there
might
be
some
question
whether
this
was
or
was
not
within
protected
right
of
the
employee.
i
would
say
broadly
that
giving
the
widest
reasonable
scope
to
the
protected
right
of
free
speech,
and
picketing
being
an
expression,
peaceful
picketing
being
an
expression
of
the
right
to
free
speech
that
there
would
certainly
and
should
be
wide
latitude
on
the
part
of
employees
to
express
themselves
as
opposed
to
a
strike.
as
the
board
has
observed
on
many
occasions,
when
an
employer
is
sought
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
employees
did
work
during
a
strike
as
an
indication
of
a
loss
of
majority
support,
this
is
a
normal
and
expectable
sort
of
thing,
and
the
board,
however,
does
not
give
it
the
credit
that
employers
in
some
instances
had
sought
to
give
it.
the
board
has
said
that
this
is
merely
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
this
particular
strike
activity.
it
is
not
necessarily
an
indication
of
a
desire
not
to
continue
being
represented
by
that
bargaining
agent.
i
think
that
this
line
of
cases
is
particularly
noticeable
for
the
board's
recognition
that
there
is
by
no
means
anything
unusual
or
in
its
nature
impermissible
about
employees
working
while
a
strike
is
in
progress.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
if
an
employee
were
not
a
union
member
had
in
some
fashion
validly
placed
himself
in
the
status
of
nonmember,
the
union
would
simply
have
no
authority
by
any
approach
to
impose
discipline
of
this
fine
type
on
the
individual.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
no,
your
honor.
in
fact
one
of
the
practicalities
of
this
business
of
leaving
membership
is
that
this
particular
union
that
is
involved
in
this
case
has
a
constitution
which
provides
the
right
to
escape
as
it
were,
that
is
to
resign
membership
once
undertaken
only
in
the
ten-day
period
at
the
end
of
the
calendar
year.
if
a
strike
were
to
take
place
in
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
it
is
consistent
for
a
union
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
and
retention
of
membership,
yes
your
honor
it
would
be.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
exactly
so.
the
fact
is
that
while
it
is
easy
to
say
that
an
employee
may
divest
himself
of
membership
and
whatever
the
obligations
are
that
in
here
in
membership
as
he
will,
this
is
not
at
all
true.
the
practicalities
are
contrary.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
law
provides
that
rules
of
this
type
are
not
within
the
prohibition
of
the
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
accepts
from
the
scope
of
that
prohibition
the
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
and
retention
of
union
membership.
a
union
is
left
with
the
authority
and
it
is
recognized
as
valid
and
permissible
for
a
union
to
adopt
such
rules.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
it's
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
the
union
is
left
with
the
authority
to
make
provision
that
once
individuals
have
become
members
of
the
union
that
that
union
membership
may
become
terminated
only
on
the
terms
of
the
existing
union
rules.
there
is
for
example
a
case,
a
court
of
appeals
case
first
circuit
which
is
cited
in
various
of
the
briefs
and
is
reported
in
volume
320
of
f.2d
reports
in
which
an
employee
or
several
employees
sought
during
a
no-contract
period
to
resign
from
membership
that
had
once
been
undertaken
and
because
they
missed
the
statute
as
it
were,
they
missed
some
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
they
failed
to
provide
with
one
single
detail
that
the
union
rules
required
be
followed
in
order
that
membership
be
terminated.
they
were
held
not
effectively
to
have
terminated
their
membership
in
the
union
and
they
became
subsequently
subject
to
a
maintenance
of
membership
provision,
a
variety
of
union
security
provision
that
was
subsequently
negotiated.
these
were
people
who
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
agree
with
your
honor
entirely
about
that
in
the
--
in
the
regard
which
we
are
presently
discussing
and
in
one
other
which
i
will
discuss
which
is
the
requirement
of
an
employee
covered
by
a
union
shop
agreement
to
become
a
member
in
the
first
place.
the
balance
of
this
discussion
that
we
have
just
undertaken
covers
the
re
--
the
remaining
portion
of
the
relationship.
once
undertaken,
then
the
membership
may
be
continued
as
the
union
rule
requires.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
point
is
quite
correct
your
honor
that
both
actions,
that
is
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
and
retention
of
union
membership
are
or
may
be
coercive
as
well
as
fines
are
coercive.
the
distinction
between
them
is
that
the
statute
does
not
imply
but
expresses
that
that
particular
coercion
which
may
in
here
in
union
membership
rules
that
is
rules
determining
when
a
person
is
and
when
he
has
ceased
to
be
a
member
is
not
covered
by
the
prohibition
of
the
statute.
this
was
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
it
says
so
in
the
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
which
reads
lastly,
i'll
read
the
whole
section
because
it's
very
brief.
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
or
its
agents
to
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7
provided.
and
this
is
the
proviso.
that
this
paragraph
shall
not
impair
the
right
of
a
labor
organization
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership
therein.
and
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
paraphrases
of
that
--
of
that
language
as
the
sponsor
of
that
legislation,
senator
holland,
stated
on
more
than
one
occasion
in
the
legislative
history.
what
he
is
talking
about
are
union
rules
that
determine
when
membership
begins
and
when
it
stops.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
discipline
--
discipline
of
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
proviso
does
not
speak
of
discipline.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
reason
for
this
is
not
because
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
or
the
proviso
to
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
it
is
because
section
7,
which
is
the
section
that
enumerates
the
rights
which
are
protected
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
does
not
include
wildcatting.
that
has
covered
explicitly
in
the
two
pages
of
legislative
history
to
which
i
referred
and
has
subsequently
as
well.
both
post
taft-hartley
as
well
as
pre-taft-hartley
in
the
uniform
holding
of
every
court
that
has
--
had
occasion
to
review
it,
such
activity
is
simply
not
a
protected
right.
not
subject
--
not
covered
by
the
act
at
all.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
this
particular
citation
is
not
in
the
brief.
it
is
pages
542
and
543
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
1947.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
proviso
itself
merely
governs
the
rule,
for
example
in
the
case
of
an
employee
who
has
become
a
member,
how
long
he
must
retain
that
membership
and
by
what
procedures
--
by
what
procedures
exclusively
he
may
resort
to
terminate
that
membership.
this
is
quite
correct.
i
might
just
speak
at
this
moment
about
this
question
of
the
beginning
of
membership
and
whether
it
is
or
can
be
required
by
a
union
shop
agreement.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
argued
in
this
case
and
it
is
explicitly
argued
that
the
particular
union
shop
provision
that
was
in
effect
covering
the
employees
involved
in
this
case
did
not
require
anything
more
than
financial
support
of
the
union.
yet
this
court
in
the
general
motors
agency
shop
case
contrasted
an
agency
shop
agreement
which
requires
only
financial
support,
and
as
this
court's
decision
states
leaves
the
option
in
the
employee
whether
to
apply
for
or
not
to
apply
for
union
membership
with
and
as
union
shop
agreement
which
in
that
case
was
identical
in
terms
to
that
involved
in
the
allis-chalmers
contract
which
this
court's
decision,
i
believe,
quite
correctly
and
patently
from
the
nature
of
the
statute
leaves
the
option
if
indeed
there
is
any
in
the
union.
the
employee
covered
has
the
obligation
to
apply
for
or
request
membership
and
then
his
sole
obligation
however,
which
in
the
default
of
which
the
union
may
have
the
man's
job
under
the
union
shop
contract
provisions,
is
to
continue
financial
support
extending
to
initiation
fees
and
dues.
but
this
court's
decision
explicitly
contrasts
like
the
identical
union
shop
provision
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
the
allis-chalmers
within
the
agency
shop,
and
yet
the
union
in
this
case
would
argue
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
them.
and
i
might
point
out
this
as
well
it
was
the
same
union
in
that
case.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
with
respect
to
the
obligation
to
apply
for
to
request
membership
and
with
respect
to
whose
option
it
is
on
that
subject
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well
the
--
the
sanction
is
that
as
this
court
stated
in
general
motors,
in
other
contexts
the
question
of
the
union
--
of
the
employee
having
the
obligation
to
become
a
member
may
have
great
significance.
what
this
court
was
speaking
about
was
in
other
context
than
one
in
which
the
union
may
seek
to
obtain
the
man's
job
for
failure
to
give
financial
support.
the
respondent
in
this
case
submits
that
this
case
represents
just
such
a
context
that
the
employee
having
become
a
member,
but
having
assumed
with
the
protection
of
the
statute
no
obligations
beyond
those
of
making
the
financial
support
has
now
become
subjected
to
just
such
another
consequence.
and
the
question
is,
is
he
subjected
to
it?
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
apparently,
if
the
union
were
to
adopt
a
very
restrictive
rule
as,
indeed
the
uaw
rule
is
quite
restrictive
on
terminating,
it
becomes
virtually
irrevocable.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
was
speaking
only
of
the
practical
restrictive
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well,
the
--
what
might
be
the
holding
of
a
case
at
common
law
is
genuinely
problematical.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
there
is
available
to
the
court
a
recorded
and
existing
and
current
and
most
relevant
practical
example
of
just
what
happens.
the
employee
against
whom
the
pilot
collection
suit
was
brought
rising
out
of
this
situation
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
testified
that
he
had
done
nothing
more
than
was
required
of
him
by
the
union
shop
contract
provision.
and
yet
because
of
a
conflict
of
evidence,
the
evidence
from
the
union
side
being
that
he
was
a
member
because
he
had
to
become
a
member,
the
court
made
findings,
the
lower
court
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
there
was
no
evidence
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
we
might
get
to
the
basic
reason
why
the
protection
of
section
7
ran
to
union
members
as
well
as
to
nonmembers.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
this
in
an
answer.
the
case,
the
collection
pilot
suit
arising
out
of
this
case
truly
is
pending
in
the
wisconsin
courts,
but
there
has
been
a
case
of
this
kind
already
decided
by
the
wisconsin
courts
and
it
is
the
established
precedent
in
the
jurisdiction
of
wisconsin
that
union
fines
are
collectable.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
there
plainly
could
be
in
any
situation
a
certain
contract
defenses
of
course,
regardless
whether
the
principle
that
a
union
member
is
liable
to
a
fine
might
be
advanced.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
your
honor,
and
i
would
refer
by
analogy
to
a
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
which
in
reviewing
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
endows
defendants
with
the
right
not
to
be
prosecuted
for
non-forcible
presence
in
certain
establishments
covered
by
the
act
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
act
for
even
a
prosecution
that
was
doomed
to
failure
to
be
in
the
error.
the
burden
of
having
to
defend
even
an
invalid
prosecution
or
one
inevitably
bound
not
to
succeed
itself
is
a
threat.
and
in
the
practicalities
of
industrial
life
for
members
of
industrial
union
bargaining
units,
this
is
the
most
formidable
threat.
they
would
be
left
first
of
all
to
wonder
what
the
decision
of
the
court
might
be,
and
even
if
they
were
confident
of
what
it
might
be,
the
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
if
the
union
threatens
to
levy
a
fine,
yes
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
i
think
i
would
agree
with
that.
it
certainly
is
not
definite
that
the
common
law
on
a
subject
to
voluntary
associations
in
each
jurisdiction
would
permit
collectability,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
that
frankly,
in
most
jurisdictions,
this
issue
has
never
arisen
in
the
common
law,
so
just
is
not
known
what
the
fact
is.
but
in
wisconsin
we
do
know
that
it
is
one
of
the
few
jurisdictions
in
which
fines
levied
by
unions
against
employee
members
who
did
not
participate
in
action
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case
are
in
general
collectable.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
that
case
is
cited
in
several
of
the
briefs.
it
is
the
decision
reported
at
11
wisconsin
2d
it
is
cited
in
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
such
argument.
i
think
it
is
conceded.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well
that
--
that
issue
arose
in
the
court
collection
suit
because
the
defendant
asserted
a
contract
defense.
he
submitted
that
the
union
had
itself
not
discharged
the
union
side
of
the
contractual
obligation
to
call
a
strike
in
a
certain
fashion.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
fines
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
there
is
one
such
pilot
suit
which
was
brought
to
confirm
the
precedent
and
the
union
has
been
scrupulous
in
preserving
its
rights
so
that
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
just
against
the
one
employee.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
judgment
is
appealable.
it's
final
and
appealable
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
has
been
appealed
and
is
pending
on
appeal
in
that
court
now,
according
to
the
court
expressly
pending
the
decision
of
this
court
on
the
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well,
the
employees
have
a
variety
of
arguments.one
of
them
concerning
a
variety
of
contract
defenses
to
the
collectability
of
the
suit,
but
the
one
relevant
to
this
case
and
the
reason
why
the
court
is
holding
it
is
that
it
is
a
cont
--
it
is
contrary
to
public
policy
as
expressed
in
the
prohibition
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
federal
act
that
--
that
such
a
fine
should
be
enforceable.
and
of
course
then,
implicit
in
this
is
the
argument
of
preemption
which
is
that
the
state
courts
preempted.
all
of
those
arguments
are
very
vitally
and
vigorously
presented.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
that's
correct.

mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
point
of
this
case
which
has
been
a
point
of
astonishment
with
the
respondent
is
that
actually
every
element
of
the
offense
which
is
charged
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
here
has
long
since
and
in
a
multitude
of
cases
been
established.
the
union
and
the
board,
however,
find
themselves
incapable
of
assembling
these
separately
established
elements
so
as
to
result
in
the
conclusion
that
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
here.
it
has
been
established
for
example
long
since
indeed
as
long
ago
as
1952
in
the
bell
aircraft
case
that
work
--
that
returning
to
work
during
a
union
called
strike
was
a
protected
right
and
the
union
was
forbidden
and
prohibited
by
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
from
visiting
any
coercive
reprisal
against
that
--
against
that
member.
the
question
which
unions
argument
principally
revolves
around
is
the
--
is
the
argument
that
membership
in
itself
inherently
implies
waiver.
and
the
cases
are
legion
in
which
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
violations
have
been
found
with
respect
to
union
action,
coercive
action
vis-à-vis
a
member.
and
this
court
has
decided
a
number
of
such
cases.
for
example,
in
the
radio
officers
case
so
cited,
it
was
several
cases
consolidated.
in
both
of
them,
in
both
the
radio
officers
union,
one
of
those
consolidated
cases
and
in
the
teamsters
one
of
those
consolidated
cases,
the
individuals
who
were
coerced
in
--
in
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
were
not
only
members
of
the
union,
but
in
the
teamsters
case,
the
coercion
was
pursuant
to
a
standing
written
union
rule
providing
for
the
coercion.
the
question
only
being,
was
the
action
of
the
union
coercive?
was
the
act
for
which
the
coerce
--
the
coercion
was
applied
a
protected
right?
now,
the
fact
is
that
it
is
virtually
indisputable
that
it
is
a
right
for
an
employee
to
refrain
from
working
during
a
strike,
and
the
only
question
really
remaining,
indeed
the
solicitor
concedes
this
in
--
in
the
brief
for
the
board,
concedes
this,
and
says
that
there
is
only
one
question
really.
is
the
action
of
the
union
coercive
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
this
the
board
itself
has
also
answered.
in
the
roberts
and
skura
line
of
cases
in
which
the
board
found
8

(a)
unfair
labor
practices
when
unions
impose
fines
against
employees
for
exercising
their
protected
right
to
resort

process
stated
that
not
only
were
fines
within
a
co
--
coercion,
but
they
were
in
their
nature
coercion
and
it
was
plain.
it
was
an
indisputable
fact.
now,
when
all
of
these
precedents
are
assembled
the
conclusion
inevitably
follows
that
--
that
the
imposition
of
a
fine
is
coercion,
and
it
is
coercion
directed
specifically
to
an
inherently
employment
matter.
and
despite
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
and
not
within
the
proviso
because
the
rule
applied
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
rules
of
the
union
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
of
holding
and
hitting
if
you
will,
and
the
union
rules
may
well
provide
for
that
holding
by
making
it
difficult
or
virtually
impossible
to
get
out
of
the
union.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
address
myself
first
to
the
last
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
in
order
to
explain
what
the
significance
of
any
union
authority
to
impose
discipline
in
a
so-called
wildcat
situation
is
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
a
union
would
have
authority
over
employees
only
if
they
were
members.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
it
may
be
in
a
situation
where
there
was
an
exclusive,
even
where
there
was
an
exclusive
agency
that
not
all
the
employees
in
the
unit
may
be
members.
so
we
concern
ourselves
first
only
with
that
group.
it
is
from
the
membership
relationship
that
any
authority
which
does
exist
arises.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
we
are
speaking
now
of
members.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
question
then
whether
the
union
may
take
action
is
in
two
parts.
they
may
do
so
if
authority
of
this
type
arises
out
of
the
membership
relationship,
and
this
is
a
question
of
common
law.
in
many
common
law
jurisdictions
or
in
the
common
law
in
many
jurisdictions,
the
right
of
the
union
to
have
certain
disciplinary
authorities
over
its
membership
has
been
recognized
over
the
years.
now,
the
question
whether
in
a
particular
instance
the
union
may
impose
a
fine
which
is
the
specific
subject
of
discussion
here
would
depend
upon
whether
there
is
some
other
law
forbidding
it
and
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
question
is
would
the
imposition
of
such
a
fine
violate
the
statute?
the
answer
is
no,
because
wildcat
activity
is
not
a
section
7
protected
right
and
therefore
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
which
forbids
coercions
of
the
exercise
of
those
rights
simply
does
not
apply.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
if
the
court
please,
the
distinction
is
this.
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
this
act
in
1947,
it
had
already
become
established
under
section
7
of
the
wagner
act
that
unauthorized
strike
activity
was
not
an
action
of
a
concerted
bargaining
activity
through
a
representative
of
the
employee's
choosing.
this
is
the
only
kind
of
activity
which
section
7
concerns
itself
with
at
all.
in
the
house
bill,
it
was
proposed
that
there'd
be
some
references
to
the
authority
of
unions
in
wildcat
strike
situations.
this
was
expressly
not
included
in
the
act
as
passed
and
the
conference
report
explicitly
states
this
because
it
was
already
established
that
it
was
not
the
concern
of
either
--
it
had
not
been
the
concern
of
the
wagner
act
and
it
was
not
being
the
concern
of
the
taft-hartley
act
to
cover
activities
that
were
not
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
thank
you,
your
honor.
to
--
finally
to
dispose
of
this
question
which
the
respondent
looks
on
as
a
spurious
comparison
of
the
question
of
union
authority
with
respect
to
wildcatting
in
relationship
to
union
authority
if
any,
in
the
case
of
employees
who
desire
to
work
during
a
strike,
i
would
like
to
make
just
two
citation
references.
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
labor
relations
act
of
1947,
at
pages
542
to
543
with
copious
citations
to
the
law
as
it
had
developed
under
the
wagner
act,
it
is
explicit
that
wildcatting
or
unauthorized
strike
activity
is
simply
not
a
subject
of
the
coverage
of
the
section
7
of
the
act.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
your
honor
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
where
there
is
an
established
bargaining
agency,
the
right
that
employees
have
is
to
pursue
affirmatively
collective
bargaining
activity
only
through
that
bargaining
agency.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well,
the
other
proposition
is
not
the
reverse
of
that
proposition.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
reason
for
it
is
this.
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
law
and
it
was
the
primary
concern
of
the
congress
to
pass
this
law
to
minimize
interruptions
to
commerce.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
striking
does
this.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
it
does
not
hold
to

mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
it
does
not
hold
true
because
it
was
so
plainly
the
reason
for
protection
that
employees
be
given
a
choice
whether
to
participate
in
or
to
refrain
from
participating
in
concerted
union
activities
that
the
law
was
drafted
with
that
purpose
precisely.
they
do
have
that
right
and
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
it
says
concerted
activity
or
collective
bargaining
activity
through
representatives
of
the
choo
--
choosing
of
the
employees,
i
believe
is
the
full
text
of
section
7.
the
other
references
that
i
would
make
to
the
legislative
history
are
those
which
are
cited
at
pages
16
and
17
of
the
respondent's
brief
which
could
not
be
more
explicit.
for
example,
on
page
16,
senator
taft,
the
principal
proponent
of
this
legislation
and
sponsor
of
it
in
the
senate
stated
explicitly
in
his
analysis
of
the
act
as
passed,
and
i
quote,
"the
prohibition
contained
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
applies
to
coercive
acts
of
unions
against
employees
who
did
not
wish
to
join
or
did
not
care
to
participate
in
a
strike
or
a
picket
line".
this
language
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
not
with
respect
to
the
right
of
employees
to
refrain
from
collective
bargaining
activity.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well
then
perhaps
there
can
be
one
only
with
respect
--
it
would
have
significance
only
with
respect
to
the
employees
exposing
themselves
to
employer
action.
if
there
is
no
bargaining
agent
then
there
is
no
question
of
the
employees
engaging
in
collective
bargaining
through
representatives
of
their
choosing.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
no,
that
is
not
correct.
he
loses
his
right
not
to
go
to
work
if
the
union
has
not
declared
a
strike.
this
is
--
it's
true,
it's
difficult
to
express
this
but
that
is
the
analysis
of
this
that
the
respondent
would
make.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
that
is,
i
think,
a
fair
way
of
expressing
it.
now,
the
facts
are
substantially
as
the
solicitor
outlined
them.
there
are,
however
an
aspect
or
two,
of
the
facts
which
deserve
some
notice.
first
of
all,
there
has
been,
in
view
of
the
respondent,
an
undue
concentration
and
again
a
spurious
one,
on
the
precise
amount
of
the
fine
which
ultimately
came
to
be
imposed.
i
think
the
simple
response
to
this
is
that
it
is
undisputed.
the
threat
was
of
a
fine
for
each
offense
of
working
during
the
progress
of
the
strike
and
it
was
explicit
in
the
threat
that
each
day
could
constitute
a
separate
such
offense.
i
think
it's
an
elementary
proposition
that
the
scope
of
--
it
is
the
scope
of
a
threat
which
is
relevant
to
coercion.
some
employees
did
work
during
the
strike.
there
has
been
some
concentration
on
the
relative
proportion
of
those
who
did
contrasted
with
those
who
did
not.
but
we
must
remember
that
this
strike
occurred
in
the
context
of
defined
threat
and
in
that
context,
the
respondent
believes
that
it
is
frankly
surprising
that
there
were
not
more
who
did
so.
it
is
not
surprising
that
there
were
not
more
who
did
so.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
right
--
there
might
be
a
question
of
this
kind.
as
i
outlined
in
the
case
of
the
distinction
between
an
unauthorized
strike
and
the
refraining
from
a
strike
which
is
authorized,
the
right
that
employees
have
is
to
refrain
from
certain
activities,
certain
union
activities.
if
an
employee
were
affirmatively
to
participate
in
a
counter
union
activity,
there
might
be
some
question
whether
this
was
or
was
not
within
protected
right
of
the
employee.
i
would
say
broadly
that
giving
the
widest
reasonable
scope
to
the
protected
right
of
free
speech,
and
picketing
being
an
expression,
peaceful
picketing
being
an
expression
of
the
right
to
free
speech
that
there
would
certainly
and
should
be
wide
latitude
on
the
part
of
employees
to
express
themselves
as
opposed
to
a
strike.
as
the
board
has
observed
on
many
occasions,
when
an
employer
is
sought
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
employees
did
work
during
a
strike
as
an
indication
of
a
loss
of
majority
support,
this
is
a
normal
and
expectable
sort
of
thing,
and
the
board,
however,
does
not
give
it
the
credit
that
employers
in
some
instances
had
sought
to
give
it.
the
board
has
said
that
this
is
merely
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
this
particular
strike
activity.
it
is
not
necessarily
an
indication
of
a
desire
not
to
continue
being
represented
by
that
bargaining
agent.
i
think
that
this
line
of
cases
is
particularly
noticeable
for
the
board's
recognition
that
there
is
by
no
means
anything
unusual
or
in
its
nature
impermissible
about
employees
working
while
a
strike
is
in
progress.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
if
an
employee
were
not
a
union
member
had
in
some
fashion
validly
placed
himself
in
the
status
of
nonmember,
the
union
would
simply
have
no
authority
by
any
approach
to
impose
discipline
of
this
fine
type
on
the
individual.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
no,
your
honor.
in
fact
one
of
the
practicalities
of
this
business
of
leaving
membership
is
that
this
particular
union
that
is
involved
in
this
case
has
a
constitution
which
provides
the
right
to
escape
as
it
were,
that
is
to
resign
membership
once
undertaken
only
in
the
ten-day
period
at
the
end
of
the
calendar
year.
if
a
strike
were
to
take
place
in
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
it
is
consistent
for
a
union
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
and
retention
of
membership,
yes
your
honor
it
would
be.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
exactly
so.
the
fact
is
that
while
it
is
easy
to
say
that
an
employee
may
divest
himself
of
membership
and
whatever
the
obligations
are
that
in
here
in
membership
as
he
will,
this
is
not
at
all
true.
the
practicalities
are
contrary.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
law
provides
that
rules
of
this
type
are
not
within
the
prohibition
of
the
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
accepts
from
the
scope
of
that
prohibition
the
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
and
retention
of
union
membership.
a
union
is
left
with
the
authority
and
it
is
recognized
as
valid
and
permissible
for
a
union
to
adopt
such
rules.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
it's
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
the
union
is
left
with
the
authority
to
make
provision
that
once
individuals
have
become
members
of
the
union
that
that
union
membership
may
become
terminated
only
on
the
terms
of
the
existing
union
rules.
there
is
for
example
a
case,
a
court
of
appeals
case
first
circuit
which
is
cited
in
various
of
the
briefs
and
is
reported
in
volume
320
of
f.2d
reports
in
which
an
employee
or
several
employees
sought
during
a
no-contract
period
to
resign
from
membership
that
had
once
been
undertaken
and
because
they
missed
the
statute
as
it
were,
they
missed
some
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
they
failed
to
provide
with
one
single
detail
that
the
union
rules
required
be
followed
in
order
that
membership
be
terminated.
they
were
held
not
effectively
to
have
terminated
their
membership
in
the
union
and
they
became
subsequently
subject
to
a
maintenance
of
membership
provision,
a
variety
of
union
security
provision
that
was
subsequently
negotiated.
these
were
people
who
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
agree
with
your
honor
entirely
about
that
in
the
--
in
the
regard
which
we
are
presently
discussing
and
in
one
other
which
i
will
discuss
which
is
the
requirement
of
an
employee
covered
by
a
union
shop
agreement
to
become
a
member
in
the
first
place.
the
balance
of
this
discussion
that
we
have
just
undertaken
covers
the
re
--
the
remaining
portion
of
the
relationship.
once
undertaken,
then
the
membership
may
be
continued
as
the
union
rule
requires.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
point
is
quite
correct
your
honor
that
both
actions,
that
is
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
and
retention
of
union
membership
are
or
may
be
coercive
as
well
as
fines
are
coercive.
the
distinction
between
them
is
that
the
statute
does
not
imply
but
expresses
that
that
particular
coercion
which
may
in
here
in
union
membership
rules
that
is
rules
determining
when
a
person
is
and
when
he
has
ceased
to
be
a
member
is
not
covered
by
the
prohibition
of
the
statute.
this
was
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
it
says
so
in
the
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
which
reads
lastly,
i'll
read
the
whole
section
because
it's
very
brief.
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
or
its
agents
to
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7
provided.
and
this
is
the
proviso.
that
this
paragraph
shall
not
impair
the
right
of
a
labor
organization
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership
therein.
and
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
paraphrases
of
that
--
of
that
language
as
the
sponsor
of
that
legislation,
senator
holland,
stated
on
more
than
one
occasion
in
the
legislative
history.
what
he
is
talking
about
are
union
rules
that
determine
when
membership
begins
and
when
it
stops.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
discipline
--
discipline
of
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
proviso
does
not
speak
of
discipline.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
reason
for
this
is
not
because
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
or
the
proviso
to
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
it
is
because
section
7,
which
is
the
section
that
enumerates
the
rights
which
are
protected
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
does
not
include
wildcatting.
that
has
covered
explicitly
in
the
two
pages
of
legislative
history
to
which
i
referred
and
has
subsequently
as
well.
both
post
taft-hartley
as
well
as
pre-taft-hartley
in
the
uniform
holding
of
every
court
that
has
--
had
occasion
to
review
it,
such
activity
is
simply
not
a
protected
right.
not
subject
--
not
covered
by
the
act
at
all.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
this
particular
citation
is
not
in
the
brief.
it
is
pages
542
and
543
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
1947.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
proviso
itself
merely
governs
the
rule,
for
example
in
the
case
of
an
employee
who
has
become
a
member,
how
long
he
must
retain
that
membership
and
by
what
procedures
--
by
what
procedures
exclusively
he
may
resort
to
terminate
that
membership.
this
is
quite
correct.
i
might
just
speak
at
this
moment
about
this
question
of
the
beginning
of
membership
and
whether
it
is
or
can
be
required
by
a
union
shop
agreement.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
argued
in
this
case
and
it
is
explicitly
argued
that
the
particular
union
shop
provision
that
was
in
effect
covering
the
employees
involved
in
this
case
did
not
require
anything
more
than
financial
support
of
the
union.
yet
this
court
in
the
general
motors
agency
shop
case
contrasted
an
agency
shop
agreement
which
requires
only
financial
support,
and
as
this
court's
decision
states
leaves
the
option
in
the
employee
whether
to
apply
for
or
not
to
apply
for
union
membership
with
and
as
union
shop
agreement
which
in
that
case
was
identical
in
terms
to
that
involved
in
the
allis-chalmers
contract
which
this
court's
decision,
i
believe,
quite
correctly
and
patently
from
the
nature
of
the
statute
leaves
the
option
if
indeed
there
is
any
in
the
union.
the
employee
covered
has
the
obligation
to
apply
for
or
request
membership
and
then
his
sole
obligation
however,
which
in
the
default
of
which
the
union
may
have
the
man's
job
under
the
union
shop
contract
provisions,
is
to
continue
financial
support
extending
to
initiation
fees
and
dues.
but
this
court's
decision
explicitly
contrasts
like
the
identical
union
shop
provision
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
the
allis-chalmers
within
the
agency
shop,
and
yet
the
union
in
this
case
would
argue
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
them.
and
i
might
point
out
this
as
well
it
was
the
same
union
in
that
case.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
with
respect
to
the
obligation
to
apply
for
to
request
membership
and
with
respect
to
whose
option
it
is
on
that
subject
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well
the
--
the
sanction
is
that
as
this
court
stated
in
general
motors,
in
other
contexts
the
question
of
the
union
--
of
the
employee
having
the
obligation
to
become
a
member
may
have
great
significance.
what
this
court
was
speaking
about
was
in
other
context
than
one
in
which
the
union
may
seek
to
obtain
the
man's
job
for
failure
to
give
financial
support.
the
respondent
in
this
case
submits
that
this
case
represents
just
such
a
context
that
the
employee
having
become
a
member,
but
having
assumed
with
the
protection
of
the
statute
no
obligations
beyond
those
of
making
the
financial
support
has
now
become
subjected
to
just
such
another
consequence.
and
the
question
is,
is
he
subjected
to
it?
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
apparently,
if
the
union
were
to
adopt
a
very
restrictive
rule
as,
indeed
the
uaw
rule
is
quite
restrictive
on
terminating,
it
becomes
virtually
irrevocable.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
was
speaking
only
of
the
practical
restrictive
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well,
the
--
what
might
be
the
holding
of
a
case
at
common
law
is
genuinely
problematical.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
there
is
available
to
the
court
a
recorded
and
existing
and
current
and
most
relevant
practical
example
of
just
what
happens.
the
employee
against
whom
the
pilot
collection
suit
was
brought
rising
out
of
this
situation
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
testified
that
he
had
done
nothing
more
than
was
required
of
him
by
the
union
shop
contract
provision.
and
yet
because
of
a
conflict
of
evidence,
the
evidence
from
the
union
side
being
that
he
was
a
member
because
he
had
to
become
a
member,
the
court
made
findings,
the
lower
court
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
there
was
no
evidence
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
we
might
get
to
the
basic
reason
why
the
protection
of
section
7
ran
to
union
members
as
well
as
to
nonmembers.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
this
in
an
answer.
the
case,
the
collection
pilot
suit
arising
out
of
this
case
truly
is
pending
in
the
wisconsin
courts,
but
there
has
been
a
case
of
this
kind
already
decided
by
the
wisconsin
courts
and
it
is
the
established
precedent
in
the
jurisdiction
of
wisconsin
that
union
fines
are
collectable.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
there
plainly
could
be
in
any
situation
a
certain
contract
defenses
of
course,
regardless
whether
the
principle
that
a
union
member
is
liable
to
a
fine
might
be
advanced.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
your
honor,
and
i
would
refer
by
analogy
to
a
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
which
in
reviewing
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
endows
defendants
with
the
right
not
to
be
prosecuted
for
non-forcible
presence
in
certain
establishments
covered
by
the
act
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
act
for
even
a
prosecution
that
was
doomed
to
failure
to
be
in
the
error.
the
burden
of
having
to
defend
even
an
invalid
prosecution
or
one
inevitably
bound
not
to
succeed
itself
is
a
threat.
and
in
the
practicalities
of
industrial
life
for
members
of
industrial
union
bargaining
units,
this
is
the
most
formidable
threat.
they
would
be
left
first
of
all
to
wonder
what
the
decision
of
the
court
might
be,
and
even
if
they
were
confident
of
what
it
might
be,
the
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
if
the
union
threatens
to
levy
a
fine,
yes
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
i
think
i
would
agree
with
that.
it
certainly
is
not
definite
that
the
common
law
on
a
subject
to
voluntary
associations
in
each
jurisdiction
would
permit
collectability,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
would
say
that
frankly,
in
most
jurisdictions,
this
issue
has
never
arisen
in
the
common
law,
so
just
is
not
known
what
the
fact
is.
but
in
wisconsin
we
do
know
that
it
is
one
of
the
few
jurisdictions
in
which
fines
levied
by
unions
against
employee
members
who
did
not
participate
in
action
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case
are
in
general
collectable.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
that
case
is
cited
in
several
of
the
briefs.
it
is
the
decision
reported
at
11
wisconsin
2d
it
is
cited
in
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
such
argument.
i
think
it
is
conceded.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well
that
--
that
issue
arose
in
the
court
collection
suit
because
the
defendant
asserted
a
contract
defense.
he
submitted
that
the
union
had
itself
not
discharged
the
union
side
of
the
contractual
obligation
to
call
a
strike
in
a
certain
fashion.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
fines
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
there
is
one
such
pilot
suit
which
was
brought
to
confirm
the
precedent
and
the
union
has
been
scrupulous
in
preserving
its
rights
so
that
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
just
against
the
one
employee.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
judgment
is
appealable.
it's
final
and
appealable
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
has
been
appealed
and
is
pending
on
appeal
in
that
court
now,
according
to
the
court
expressly
pending
the
decision
of
this
court
on
the
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
well,
the
employees
have
a
variety
of
arguments.one
of
them
concerning
a
variety
of
contract
defenses
to
the
collectability
of
the
suit,
but
the
one
relevant
to
this
case
and
the
reason
why
the
court
is
holding
it
is
that
it
is
a
cont
--
it
is
contrary
to
public
policy
as
expressed
in
the
prohibition
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
federal
act
that
--
that
such
a
fine
should
be
enforceable.
and
of
course
then,
implicit
in
this
is
the
argument
of
preemption
which
is
that
the
state
courts
preempted.
all
of
those
arguments
are
very
vitally
and
vigorously
presented.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
that's
correct.

mr.
howard
c.
equitz
the
point
of
this
case
which
has
been
a
point
of
astonishment
with
the
respondent
is
that
actually
every
element
of
the
offense
which
is
charged
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
here
has
long
since
and
in
a
multitude
of
cases
been
established.
the
union
and
the
board,
however,
find
themselves
incapable
of
assembling
these
separately
established
elements
so
as
to
result
in
the
conclusion
that
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
here.
it
has
been
established
for
example
long
since
indeed
as
long
ago
as
1952
in
the
bell
aircraft
case
that
work
--
that
returning
to
work
during
a
union
called
strike
was
a
protected
right
and
the
union
was
forbidden
and
prohibited
by
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
from
visiting
any
coercive
reprisal
against
that
--
against
that
member.
the
question
which
unions
argument
principally
revolves
around
is
the
--
is
the
argument
that
membership
in
itself
inherently
implies
waiver.
and
the
cases
are
legion
in
which
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
violations
have
been
found
with
respect
to
union
action,
coercive
action
vis-à-vis
a
member.
and
this
court
has
decided
a
number
of
such
cases.
for
example,
in
the
radio
officers
case
so
cited,
it
was
several
cases
consolidated.
in
both
of
them,
in
both
the
radio
officers
union,
one
of
those
consolidated
cases
and
in
the
teamsters
one
of
those
consolidated
cases,
the
individuals
who
were
coerced
in
--
in
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
were
not
only
members
of
the
union,
but
in
the
teamsters
case,
the
coercion
was
pursuant
to
a
standing
written
union
rule
providing
for
the
coercion.
the
question
only
being,
was
the
action
of
the
union
coercive?
was
the
act
for
which
the
coerce
--
the
coercion
was
applied
a
protected
right?
now,
the
fact
is
that
it
is
virtually
indisputable
that
it
is
a
right
for
an
employee
to
refrain
from
working
during
a
strike,
and
the
only
question
really
remaining,
indeed
the
solicitor
concedes
this
in
--
in
the
brief
for
the
board,
concedes
this,
and
says
that
there
is
only
one
question
really.
is
the
action
of
the
union
coercive
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
this
the
board
itself
has
also
answered.
in
the
roberts
and
skura
line
of
cases
in
which
the
board
found
8

unfair
labor
practices
when

impose

against

stated
that
not
only
were

a

--
coercion,
but
they
were
in
their
nature
coercion
and
it
was
plain.
it
was
an
indisputable
fact.
now,
when
all
of
these
precedents
are
assembled
the
conclusion
inevitably
follows
that
--
that
the
imposition
of
a
fine
is
coercion,
and
it
is
coercion
directed
specifically
to
an
inherently
employment
matter.
and
despite
--
mr.
howard
c.
equitz
and
not
within
the
proviso
because
the
rule
applied
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
rules
of
the
union
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
of
holding
and
hitting
if
you
will,
and
the
union
rules
may
well
provide
for
that
holding
by
making
it
difficult
or
virtually
impossible
to
get
out
of
the
union.
thank
you.
