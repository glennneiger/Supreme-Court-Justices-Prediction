chief

suppose
the
--
suppose
the
union
fined
these
men
for
conducting
wild
--
wildcat
strike
instead
of
for
the
conduct
that's
complained
up
here,
would
you
say
that
that
is
permissible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
we
are
talking
about
different
things.
i
thought
you
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
couldn't
fine
them
was
because
these
men
were
not
previewed
to
the
--
to
the
making
of
the
contract.
that
they
came
into
the
--
came
into
the
thing
without
knowing
what
the
contract
was,
without
having
anything
to
do
with
the
bargaining
for
it,
and
therefore
they
should
not
be
held
responsible
for
--
for
the
--
for
those
terms.
so
--
and
isn't
that
exactly
the
same
thing
we
would
have
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
i
think
both
of
you
are
arguing,
i'd
like
to
have
the
argu
--
argument
of
both
of
you
to
find
out
if
there's
any
disagreement
between
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
--
i
asked
you
the
precise
question
if
the
union
finding
or
were
conducting
a
wildcat
strike
is
--
is
that
permissible
or
not
under
your
argument
that
you
do
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
there's
no-strike
clause
in
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
equitz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
these
people
were
members?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
then
now.
mr.
equitz
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
these
--
suppose
these
men
instead
of
going
to
work
had
set
up
a
counter
picket
line
saying
"we
believe
this
--
this
strike
is
wrong
and
we
believe
that
it
should
not
be
maintained".
and
they
carried
those
pickets
those
on
a
--
on
a
picket
line
of
their
--
of
their
own.
would
you
think
that
that
is
not
subject
to
a
disciplinary
proceeding
on
the
part
of
the
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
neither
that
rule
nor
one
on
fines
is
specifically
mentioned.
how
do
you
say
that
the
one
is
more
implicit
than
the
other?
certainly,
they're
both
coercive,
and
if
it's
coercive
to
fine
a
man
$20,
it
certainly
is
coercive
to
say
to
him,
"you
must
remain
in
this
union
for
one
year
and
ten
days
and
you
have
no
right
to
--
to
get
out
and
pursue
your
life
in
another
--
in
other
--
in
another
way".
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
is
far
more
coercive
than
the
other
and
--
and
that
--
that
you
think
is
implicit
in
rules
and
regulations.
why
isn't
equally
as
implicit
to
--
to
say
that
if
they
--
if
they
don't
follow
the
majority
and
don't
--
don't
do
what
the
majority
has
voted
to
do
in
regard
to
strikes
that
--
that
they
can
be
--
they
can
be
fined?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
does
this
specifically
say
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
reads
as
how?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
if
it
doesn't,
how
is
the
--
in
implicit
in
the
--
in
the
act
that
wildcat
strikes
can
be
--
you
can
fine
them
for
engaging
in
a
wildcat
strike?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
equitz,
you
--
you
may
take
three
minutes
more
to
sum
up
if
you
desire
to

so.
