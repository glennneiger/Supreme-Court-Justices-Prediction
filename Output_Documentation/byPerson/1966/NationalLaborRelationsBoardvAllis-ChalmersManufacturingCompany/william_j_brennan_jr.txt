justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
also
said
that
you
might
expel
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know.
well
if
they
said
they
might
expel
him
maybe
what
congress
intended
was
that
all
they
could
do
was
expel
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
lang
--
the
language
of
the
proviso
is
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership.
and
i
know
the
argument
is
that
if
they're
going
to
expel
him,
they
can
do
the
lesson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
when
they
--
when
they
fine
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
but
what
about
--
our
problem
here
mr.
solicitor
general
i
gather
is,
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
of
course,
they
may
refrain
from
concerted
activity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
if
--
if
they
do
refrain
and
they're
members
of
the
union,
the
proviso
suggests
they
may
be
expelled.
and
the
issue
is
whether
they
can
go
beyond
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
the
union
is
left
with
any
choice
either
to
or
but
to
expel
if
they
do
refrain.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
suggest
it's
beyond.
it
may
be
--
it
maybe
something
less
than
an
expulsion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
congress
congress
allow
anything
more
under
the
proviso
than
the
choice
for
the
union
of
expulsion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
lose
your
job.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
any
legislative
history
which
indicates
that
congress
meant
in
the
circumstances
that
the
union
could
do
anything
except
to
expel?
do
any
legislation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
impose
fines
for
example,
is
there
anything
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
in
machinist
v.
street,
well
that
was
a
railway
labor
case.
we
indicated
there
very
definitely
also
has
limitations
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
about
your
speaking
of
the
validity
of
the
provision
that
you
can't
terminate
except
for
the
last
ten
days
of
the
calendar
year.
you're
speaking
of
the
validity
of
that
and
the
context
of
whether
or
not
enforcement
of
that
rule
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
you're
speaking
of
it
as
an
unfair
labor
practice,
it
--
it's
not
clear
is
it,
that
if
one
were
to
attempt
to
resign
from
the
union
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
and
then
this
provision
were
applied
against
him
insisting
that
he
was
still
a
member
for
purposes
of
a
fine,
then
it
would
necessarily
follow
that
in
a
lawsuit
the
common
law
would
sustain
the
right
of
the
union
to
enforce
that
provision
against
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
only
--
you're
only
speaking
of
it
in
all
that
the
proviso
got
is
to
say
that
whatever
the
rules
are
as
to
acquisition
and
retention
of
membership,
the
union
is
free
to
adopt
them
and
whatever
the
coercion
or
restraint
that
may
be
involved
in
that,
that
type
of
coercion
or
restraint
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that's
all
what
that
section
says.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
was
no
evidence
there
that
he
tried
to
get
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
had
been,
i'm
only
suggesting
that
might
be
a
very
different
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
kind
of
argument
if
i
correctly
remember
the
opinion
of
the
intermediate
wisconsin
court,
for
example
one
of
them
is
that
this
is
a
kind
of
a
strike
that
the
union
was
not
authorized
to
call.
as
i
remember
the
opinion
of
the
court,
and
therefore
the
refusal
of
the
worker
to
go
along
with
it
was
--
should
not
have
subjected
in
the
fine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
suits
were
brought
to
collect
these
fines,
were
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
there
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
a
judgment
entered
against
the
employee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
just
one
of
the
suits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
say
was
the
page
number
of
93
n.w.?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
within
the
proviso
for
what
reason?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
you
said
that
8
is
part
of
7.
is
the
focus
of
the
board's
argument
that
a
proviso
of
8
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
affects
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
who
leaves
it
of
the
--
of
any
unfair
labor
practice
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
mr.
silard's
argument
that
the
whole
structure
of
the
act
contemplated
that
internal
affairs
of
the
unions
were
to
be
the
unions
concern
at
least
until
the
landrum-griffin
act
amendments
in
1959,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
provision
of
the
statute
says
it's
alright
for
the
union
to
do
this?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
it
this
way
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
isn't
that
the
government's
argument
does
not
rely
on
the
proviso
of
section
8?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
