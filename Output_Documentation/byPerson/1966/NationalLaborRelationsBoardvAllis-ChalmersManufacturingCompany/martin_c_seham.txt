mr.
martin
c.
seham
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
23
individual
employees
of
the
new
york
times
who
under
circumstances
similar
to
that
involved
in
this
case,
were
fined
four
weeks
wages,
in
some
cases
as
much
as
$1500
each,
for
having
crossed
the
picket
line,
and
in
that
sense
violated
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
union
to
which
they
belong.
i've
been
granted
ten
minutes
to
argue
to
the
court
by
allis-chalmers,
and
i
want
to
take
advantage
of
those
ten
minutes
to
reply
to
the
arguments
which
have
been
made
by
the
solicitor
general,
which
have
been
made
by
the
union,
to
the
effect
that
and
i'm
paraphrasing
the
words
of
the
solicitor
general,
the
section
7
rights
do
not
exist
here
for
these
employees
or
employees
in
these
circumstances
because
they
have
opted
out
of
those
rights.
they
have
made
a
choice
to
submit
themselves
to
union
discipline
and
to
the
union
requirements
and
consequently
these
statutory
rights
which
congress
has
enacted
for
them
are
set
aside
and
put
to
naught.
now,
i
think
the
point
of
departure
has
to
be
the
source
of
the
initial
obligation
or
the
initial
impetuous
to
membership
and
that
source
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
is
a
collecting
bargaining
agreement
which
is
entered
into
and
which
is
negotiated
by
a
corporate
management
on
one
hand
and
a
union
representative
on
the
other
hand.
the
individual
employees,
the
man
who
has
a
crisis
of
conscience,
the
man
who
has
an
individual
point
of
view
is
not
sitting
at
that
table
when
that
bargain
is
reached,
when
that
provision
is
included
in
the
contract.
now,
some
argument
has
been
made
that
there
is
a
difference
in
language
in
the
allis-chalmers
contract
that
perhaps
the
contract
itself
indicates
a
limitation
on
the
type
of
membership
which
the
man
is
obligated
to
submit
himself
to.
this
may
or
may
not
be,
in
point
of
fact,
the
record
stipulates
that
all
the
employees
involved
became
members
pursuant
to
that
clause.
the
language
itself
talks
in
terms
of
becoming
a
member
to
the
extent
of
--
of
payment
of
dues
and
intiation
fees.
and
of
course,
in
the
new
york
times
situation
and
--
and
in
most
situations
in
--
in
industrial
relations
context,
the
clause
is
a
much
broader
clause.
it's
a
typical
union
job
provision
which
says
you
must
become
a
member
within
30
days
of
your
employment
of
30
days
of
the
contract.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
well
i
--
i
don't
think
i
necessarily
have
to
draw
that
line
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
distinction.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
distinction
which
should
be
or
can
be
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
and
that's
--
that's
true
your
honor,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
employees
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
are
not
in
fact
voluntary
members,
and
i
would
submit
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
any
situation
in
which
an
employee
is
a
voluntary
member
when
we
think
of
voluntarism
in
the
sense
of
a
knowing
a
free,
an
unimpeded
waiver
surrendered
of
a
statutory
right.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
i'm
sure
it's
not
to
be
le
--
legalistic.
i
think
the
practical
compulsions
here
are
determined
to
be
expanding.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
i
think
that
is
so,
but
again
if
we're
to
--
the
--
the
argument
that
i
am
trying
to
respond
to
is
that
there
has
been
a
voluntarily
waiver
of
a
statutory
right.
and
i
think
when
you
try
to
evaluate
that
argument
and
decide
whether
there
has
in
fact
then
a
voluntary
waiver,
you
have
to
look
at
the
practicalities
of
the
situation,
what
has
in
fact
happened
in
this
case
whether
there
was
a
disclosure
to
the
employee
of
what
his
alternatives
were
whether
he
did
not
receive.
and
in
this
--
this
is
in
fact
the
case
here,
and
in
fact
the
case
in
99.9%
of
industrial
relation
situation,
the
employee
gets
a
notice
and
he
gets
a
card
to
get
what's
in
the
contract
because
he
didn't
negotiate
that
contract.
he
gets
a
card
and
it
says,
"you
must
join
the
union
within
30
days,
sign
this
card
or
you
lose
your
job".
now,
maybe
he
could
go
to
his
lawyer
and
say,
"well
is
this
so
and
--
and
how
would
i
protect
my
rights
and
is
there
some
other
card
i
can
sign
and
maybe
there's
some
other
way
of
doing
it?"
but
i
think
we
all
recognize
as
a
practical
matter,
number
one
is
lawyers
not
likely
to
know,
number
two
an
employee
who
is
working
on
an
assembly
--
assembly
line
and
making
$100
a
week
or
$110
a
week,
is
not
going
to
have
the
time
or
the
resources
to
solicit
that
kind
of
legal
advice
and
to
so
carve
out
the
restrictions
and
the
reservations
to
his
union
membership,
so
that
he's
--
he's
just
confined
it
to
the
obligation
to
pay
dues.
so
he
signs
the
card.
he
signs
the
card
which
says,
i
apply
for
membership
and
then
the
union
argues,
in
this
case
and
then
in
the
case
that
i'm
handling
in
new
york,
he
has
assumed
all
the
obligations
of
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
that
union.
he
signed
the
card.
in
point
of
fact
in
the
allis-chalmers
case,
just
as
in
our
case
with
the
new
york
times,
the
employees
did
not
get
a
copy
of
the
constitution
and
bylaws
until
they
were
charged
with
the
offense.
when
the
charges
came
--
came
to
them
and
said,
"you
are
being
hold
up
on
charges".
you
are
subject
to
a
fine.
here
is
a
copy
of
the
constitution
so
you
can
find
out
what
it's
all
about.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
well
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
i
think
that's
right,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
i
think
that
is
right
and
i
think
it
is
certainly
applicable
in
our
situation.
for
instance
again
in
the
times
situation,
the
employer
actually
sent
out
a
letter
accompanying
the
union's
letter
which
said,
"the
union's
letter
is
coming
along".
you
have
to
join
the
union.
and
we
also
want
to
inform
you
that
you
have
to
join
the
union
within
30
days.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
no,
but
--
but
it
is
in
part
responsive
to
a
suggestion
which
was,
i
think,
made
by
mr.
silard
to
the
effect
that
well,
allis-chalmers,
you
know,
knew
what
the
obligations
of
the
employees
were
and
he
assumes
or
he
thinks
or
they
--
they
would've
informed
them
of
their
--
of
their
rights
under
the
situation.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
i
think
that's
one
way
of
putting
it
your
honor,
but
i
think
another
way
of
putting
it
is
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
statutory
right.
it's
a
statutory
right
which
is,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
very
fundamental
right
which
is
the
one
to
go
to
work
or
not
go
to
work,
and
before
it
can
be
suggested
that
there
is
a
surrender
of
that
statutory
right,
that
there
has
to
be
some
very
persuasive
if
you
will,
overwhelming
showing
that
the
employee
waive
that
statutory
right,
gave
up
that
right
with
full
knowledge
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
well,
it
may
not
be
relevant
except
to
the
extent
that
i
believe
the
solicitor's
and
the
union's
primary
argument
is,
and
again
i
paraphrase
mr.
marshall,
to
the
effect
that
the
section
7
right
does
not
exist
in
this
situation
because
they
opted
to
surrender
it.
well,
i
don't
see
any
--
if
that
is
--
is
what
they
have
done,
if
they
have
done
something
so
critical
to
their
industrial
life,
i
think
that
option
has
to
be
a
very
clear
and
very
intelligent
one,
and
a
showing
has
to
be
made
that
they
voluntarily
do
it.
i
want
to
just
touch
on
one
more
point,
i'm
probably
past
my
ten
minutes
now,
but
the
--
the
single
further
point
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
the
question
of
the
coercive
effect
of
these
fines.
now,
the
union
in
its
brief
and
i
believe
on
its
argument
said
that
certainly
if
there
--
if
there
was
a
threat
for
and
i
have
it
right
here
--
that
by
threatening
them
with
physical
harm
or
with
the
loss
in
employment
benefits
after
the
strike
ended,
the
union
would've
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
this
they
concede
would've
been
coercion
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
the
circumstances
they
--
they
concede
that
this
would've
been
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
well,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
for
a
man
working
on
an
assembly
line
who
maybe
work--
who
maybe
making
$100
a
week
or
$110
a
week
or
$125
a
week,
if
you
say
to
him.
we're
going
to
take
away
the
equivalent
of
a
week's
earnings
from
you,
the
equivalent
of
a
week's
wages
from
you
that
this
is
no
different
then
and
perhaps
worst
in
a
way
than
saying,
"you're
suspended
for
a
week".
this
is
the
typical
industrial
relations
discipline.
you're
suspended
for
a
week.
you
can't
come
into
work.
but
in
fact
in
this
case
it's
even
worse
because
they
have
said
to
the
man,
"sure
you
can
come
into
work".
you
can
consume
your
time.
you
can
inhibit
and
prevent,
incapacitate
yourself
from
doing
other
gainful
employment,
and
then
when
it's
all
over,
we're
going
to
take
that
week's
wages
away
from
you.
now,
i
--
i
can't
conceive
of
any
--
of
any
other
kind
of
penalty
unless
we
increase
the
dollar
amount
that
could
be
more
coercive
than
that
very
kind
of
punishment.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
it
might
be
your
honor,
because
when
we're
talking
about
a
wildcat
strike,
we
are
talking
about
the
--
an
infringement
on
the
authority
which
the
union
does
in
fact
have
and
has
in
fact
been
taken
away
from
the
employees.
that
is
the
ability
to
negotiate
and
fix
upon
the
terms
and
conditions
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
if
during
the
term
of
a
contract,
the
employees
go
out
on
a
wildcat
strike,
they
have
violated
the
obligation
which
the
statute
imp
--
imposes
upon
them
to
grant
to
the
union
the
right
to
make
the
agreement
and
concurrently
to
respect
the
terms
of
that
agreement.
but
we're
talking
about
a
different
body
of
rights.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
well
i
--
i
do
have
an
answer
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
but
i've
also
gotten
a
note
which
reminds
me
that
mr.
equitz
also
has
an
answer.
he's
going
to
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
well,
i
--
a
--
as
i
say,
i
--
i
do
not
think
that
--
well
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
in
another
way.
if
the
employee,
let's
say,
comes
in
late
to
work,
the
hour
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
in
my
argument
i
would
say,
in
face
of
the
no-strike
clause
during
the
term
of
the
contract,
yes.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
there's
not
any
--
i
--
i
would
think
then
that
the
union
could
not
fine
them.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
thank
you,
your
honor.

alternatives
were
whether
he
did
not
receive.
and
in
this
--
this
is
in
fact
the
case
here,
and
in
fact
the
case
in
99.9%
of
industrial
relation
situation,
the
employee
gets
a
notice
and
he
gets
a
card
to
get
what's
in
the
contract
because
he
didn't
negotiate
that
contract.
he
gets
a
card
and
it
says,
"you
must
join
the
union
within
30
days,
sign
this
card
or
you
lose
your
job".
now,
maybe
he
could
go
to
his
lawyer
and
say,
"well
is
this
so
and
--
and
how
would
i
protect
my
rights
and
is
there
some
other
card
i
can
sign
and
maybe
there's
some
other
way
of
doing
it?"
but
i
think
we
all
recognize
as
a
practical
matter,
number
one
is
lawyers
not
likely
to
know,
number
two
an
employee
who
is
working
on
an
assembly
--
assembly
line
and
making
$100
a
week
or
$110
a
week,
is
not
going
to
have
the
time
or
the
resources
to
solicit
that
kind
of
legal
advice
and
to
so
carve
out
the
restrictions
and
the
reservations
to
his
union
membership,
so
that
he's
--
he's
just
confined
it
to
the
obligation
to
pay
dues.
so
he
signs
the
card.
he
signs
the
card
which
says,
i
apply
for
membership
and
then
the
union
argues,
in
this
case
and
then
in
the
case
that
i'm
handling
in
new
york,
he
has
assumed
all
the
obligations
of
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
that
union.
he
signed
the
card.
in
point
of
fact
in
the
allis-chalmers
case,
just
as
in
our
case
with
the
new
york
times,
the
employees
did
not
get
a
copy
of
the
constitution
and
bylaws
until
they
were
charged
with
the
offense.
when
the
charges
came
--
came
to
them
and
said,
"you
are
being
hold
up
on
charges".
you
are
subject
to
a
fine.
here
is
a
copy
of
the
constitution
so
you
can
find
out
what
it's
all
about.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
well
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
i
think
that's
right,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
i
think
that
is
right
and
i
think
it
is
certainly
applicable
in
our
situation.
for
instance
again
in
the
times
situation,
the
employer
actually
sent
out
a
letter
accompanying
the
union's
letter
which
said,
"the
union's
letter
is
coming
along".
you
have
to
join
the
union.
and
we
also
want
to
inform
you
that
you
have
to
join
the
union
within
30
days.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
no,
but
--
but
it
is
in
part
responsive
to
a
suggestion
which
was,
i
think,
made
by
mr.
silard
to
the
effect
that
well,
allis-chalmers,
you
know,
knew
what
the
obligations
of
the
employees
were
and
he
assumes
or
he
thinks
or
they
--
they
would've
informed
them
of
their
--
of
their
rights
under
the
situation.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
i
think
that's
one
way
of
putting
it
your
honor,
but
i
think
another
way
of
putting
it
is
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
statutory
right.
it's
a
statutory
right
which
is,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
very
fundamental
right
which
is
the
one
to
go
to
work
or
not
go
to
work,
and
before
it
can
be
suggested
that
there
is
a
surrender
of
that
statutory
right,
that
there
has
to
be
some
very
persuasive
if
you
will,
overwhelming
showing
that
the
employee
waive
that
statutory
right,
gave
up
that
right
with
full
knowledge
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
well,
it
may
not
be
relevant
except
to
the
extent
that
i
believe
the
solicitor's
and
the
union's
primary
argument
is,
and
again
i
paraphrase
mr.
marshall,
to
the
effect
that
the
section
7
right
does
not
exist
in
this
situation
because
they
opted
to
surrender
it.
well,
i
don't
see
any
--
if
that
is
--
is
what
they
have
done,
if
they
have
done
something
so
critical
to
their
industrial
life,
i
think
that
option
has
to
be
a
very
clear
and
very
intelligent
one,
and
a
showing
has
to
be
made
that
they
voluntarily
do
it.
i
want
to
just
touch
on
one
more
point,
i'm
probably
past
my
ten
minutes
now,
but
the
--
the
single
further
point
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
the
question
of
the
coercive
effect
of
these
fines.
now,
the
union
in
its
brief
and
i
believe
on
its
argument
said
that
certainly
if
there
--
if
there
was
a
threat
for
and
i
have
it
right
here
--
that
by
threatening
them
with
physical
harm
or
with
the
loss
in
employment
benefits
after
the
strike
ended,
the
union
would've
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
this
they
concede
would've
been
coercion
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
the
circumstances
they
--
they
concede
that
this
would've
been
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
well,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
for
a
man
working
on
an
assembly
line
who
maybe
work--
who
maybe
making
$100
a
week
or
$110
a
week
or
$125
a
week,
if
you
say
to
him.
we're
going
to
take
away
the
equivalent
of
a
week's
earnings
from
you,
the
equivalent
of
a
week's
wages
from
you
that
this
is
no
different
then
and
perhaps
worst
in
a
way
than
saying,
"you're
suspended
for
a
week".
this
is
the
typical
industrial
relations
discipline.
you're
suspended
for
a
week.
you
can't
come
into
work.
but
in
fact
in
this
case
it's
even
worse
because
they
have
said
to
the
man,
"sure
you
can
come
into
work".
you
can
consume
your
time.
you
can
inhibit
and
prevent,
incapacitate
yourself
from
doing
other
gainful
employment,
and
then
when
it's
all
over,
we're
going
to
take
that
week's
wages
away
from
you.
now,
i
--
i
can't
conceive
of
any
--
of
any
other
kind
of
penalty
unless
we
increase
the
dollar
amount
that
could
be
more
coercive
than
that
very
kind
of
punishment.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
it
might
be
your
honor,
because
when
we're
talking
about
a
wildcat
strike,
we
are
talking
about
the
--
an
infringement
on
the
authority
which
the
union
does
in
fact
have
and
has
in
fact
been
taken
away
from
the
employees.
that
is
the
ability
to
negotiate
and
fix
upon
the
terms
and
conditions
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
if
during
the
term
of
a
contract,
the
employees
go
out
on
a
wildcat
strike,
they
have
violated
the
obligation
which
the
statute
imp
--
imposes
upon
them
to
grant
to
the
union
the
right
to
make
the
agreement
and
concurrently
to
respect
the
terms
of
that
agreement.
but
we're
talking
about
a
different
body
of
rights.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
well
i
--
i
do
have
an
answer
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
but
i've
also
gotten
a
note
which
reminds
me
that
mr.
equitz
also
has
an
answer.
he's
going
to
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
well,
i
--
a
--
as
i
say,
i
--
i
do
not
think
that
--
well
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
in
another
way.
if
the
employee,
let's
say,
comes
in
late
to
work,
the
hour
--
mr.
martin
c.
seham
in
my
argument
i
would
say,
in
face
of
the
no-strike
clause
during
the
term
of
the
contract,
yes.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
there's
not
any
--
i
--
i
would
think
then
that
the
union
could
not
fine
them.
mr.
martin
c.
seham
thank
you,
your
honor.
