section
7
as
you
said
gives
all
employees
the
right
to
engage
in
or
to
refrain
from
concerted
activities.
and
as
i
understood
your
argument
you
just
made
is
once
they
joined
the
union,
they
opted
to
engage
in
all
concerted
activities.
this
mean
anything
the
union
does
and
then
on
they're
stuck
with,
they're
stopped
from
objecting
to
it?

the
question
here
is
somebody's

perhaps
i
missed
part
of
your

understood

the
