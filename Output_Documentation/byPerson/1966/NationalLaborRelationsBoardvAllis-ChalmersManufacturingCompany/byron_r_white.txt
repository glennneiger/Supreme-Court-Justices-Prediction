well,
i
know
but
if

you're
not

do
you

you
don't

that
the

that
the

is
not

justice

you
just
say
it
doesn't
happened
to

the
kind
of
coercion
that

justice

--
citing

justice

some
other
--
justice

but
the
language
--
the
language
covers
this
like
a
glove,
doesn't
it,
coercion?
justice
byron

white
coercive
to
expel
them
too,
isn't
it?
justice

what
if
the

rules
were
that
there
would
be
no

codes,
the

just
decided

justice

white
well
that
isn't
--
justice
byron

white
would
you
say
there
would
--
there
could
be
a
fine
if
there
wasn't
a
strike
code?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
the
same
rule
applies
to
the
wildcat
strike?
justice
byron

white
how
about
the
reverse
--
how
about
the
reverse?
you
would
say
that
you
can
fine
them
for
--
for
working,
you
can
also
fine
them
for
not
working.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
enforce
a
no-strike
clause
in
effect
that
enforce
it
by
fining
members
who
walk
off
the

justice
byron

white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
silard,
would
you
say
that
the
union
could
perhaps
bring
a
court
action
against
the
recalcitrant
employees
who
are
working
instead
of
striking?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
an
injunction.
i
suppose
maybe
norris-laguardia
didn't
bar
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
can
find
--
if
you
win
here,
could
you
go
to
court
against
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
--
that
if
you
win
the
question
of
whether
how
large
the
fine
can
be
is,
this
is
irrelevant
to
8
(b)
(1),
i
mean
maybe
there's
some
other
ways
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
pay
too
large
a
fine.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
you've
never
fined
anybody
more
than
$100,
but
i
supposed
that
literally
read
--
does
it
permit
$100
a
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no
more
than
$100
a
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
needn't
be
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
haven't
argued
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
true
whether
or
not
there's
a
no-strike
clause
in
the
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there's
a
no-strike
--
even
if
there's
not
a
no-strike
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
group
of
employees
has
a
protected
right
not
to
work
unless
the
union
authorizes
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
--
but
you
don't
think
the
reversal?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
state
concerted
view
--
concerted
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
the
words
that
to
be
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
--
these
collective
bargaining
agents
are
certified
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
where
they
held
--
where
there
are
union
members
in
a
--
in
a
bargaining
union,
there's
no
place
of
bargaining
contract.
there
is
no
certified
bargaining
agents
as
yet.
can
there
be
any
protection
of
the
welfare
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
have
protective
rights
under
section
7,
isn't
that
one
of
these
protective
rights
still
unless
there's
a
--
there
is
a
bargaining
agent
to
--
then
he
loses
his
right
to
--
to
go
to
work
when
the
union
says
don't
go
to
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
bargaining
agent
is
certified,
he
--
he
loses
half
of
that,
one
side
of
that
but
not
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
about
discipline.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
proviso
doesn't
speak
of
discipline.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
citation
of
that
legislative
history?
is
that
in
you
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
with
respect
to
losing
the
job
that
if
he
pays
there
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
sanction
is
there
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
even
if
this
isn't
an
unfair
labor
practice
then
that
the
union
could,
as
far
as
8
(b)
(1)
is
concerned,
levy
to
fine
the
--
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
it
can
be
collected?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
--
but
do
you
think
we
have
to
know
in
this
case?
is
it
relevant
enough
that
we
should
know
whether
this
fine
is
collectable
under
the
laws
of
wisconsin?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
got
those
--
are
those
in
your
brief,
those
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
congestion?
is
there
any
argument
on
the
other
side?
i
don't
remember
whether
to
the
effect
of
this
fine
is
not
collectable
in
wisconsin?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
final?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
argument
--
what's
the
argument
by
the
employees
in
the
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin?
that
it
isn't
collectible?
