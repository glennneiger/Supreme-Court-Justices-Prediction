mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
where
that
court
sitting
en
banc
in
a
four
to
three
vote,
the
national
labor
relations
board
dismissed
of
unfair
labor
practice
charged
by
the
allis-chalmers
company
against
two
locals
of
the
united
automobile
workers
union.
this
was
based
on
the
unions
imposing
fines
upon
union
members
who
crossed
the
union
picket
lines
during
several
two
strikes.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
locals
248
and
401
of
the
uaw
for
many
years
represented
the
employees
of
allis-chalmers,
two
plants
in
particular,
the
west
allis
and
the
la
crosse
both
in
wisconsin
plants.
in
1959
and
again
in
1962,
each
of
these
locals
called
economic
strikes
against
the
company
in
furtherance
of
its
contract
demands.
the
1959
strike
lasted
about
two
months,
from
february
2
to
april
19
and
during
that
strike,
175
employees
out
of
a
unit
of
some
7400
crossed
the
picket
lines
at
west
allis,
and
two
at
la
crosse.
the
1962
strike
lasted
about
a
week
and
during
that
strike,
30
out
of
a
unit
of
5500
or
so
crossed
the
line.
in
accordance
with
the
procedure
specified
in
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws,
these
strike
working
members
were
found
by
union
trial
board
to
have
engaged
in
"conduct
unbecoming
a
union
member"
and
they
were
fined
amounts
ranging
from
$20
to
$100
each.
some
members
paid
the
fines
and
others
refused
to
pay.
and
the
union
commenced
actions
and
to
collect
the
fines
in
the
state
courts
in
wisconsin,
and
one
case
was
used
as
a
test
case,
and
the
union
obtained
the
judgment
against
a
member
who
had
crossed
the
line
and
had
refused
to
pay
the
fine.
and
the
opinion
of
the
wisconsin
intermediate
appellate
court
which
upheld
this
judgment
of
the
trial
court
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief.
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
is
not
in
our
record
but
it
is
in
the
record
that's
deposited
with
the
court.
this
particular
case
is
now
pending
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
and
so
far
as
i
know
it's
not
yet
been
decided.
none
of
the
strike-making
members
has
been
expelled.
none
of
them
had
been
suspended
from
the
union,
nor
if
any
of
them
resigned
because
of
the
fines.
on
the
other
hand,
the
union
has
done
nothing
whatsoever
in
any
way
to
affect
the
employment
status
of
these
members
who
were
fined.
and
so
the
question
here
is
whether
the
union
fining
of
these
members
for
crossing
the
picket
line
and
the
subsequent
attempt
to
collect
the
fines
by
court
action
constitutes
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
employees
and
the
exercise
of
a
right
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
act.
section
7
in
turn
gives
employees
the
right
both
to
engage
and
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
union
activities.
the
board
itself
where
its
member
lead
them
dissenting,
held
that
the
union
conduct
complained
of
by
the
company
did
not
violate
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
and
upon
the
company's
petition
for
review
to
the
seventh
circuit,
a
panel
of
judges,
judges
kiley,
judge
knoch
and
judge
castle
upheld
the
board's
dismissal
of
the
charges.
upon
rehearing
on
en
banc,
the
court
withdrew
the
panel's
original
decision
and
held
with
chief
judge
hastings
and
judges
kiley
and
swygert
dissenting
that
the
union
action
did
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
act.
the
court
accordingly
set
aside
the
board's
order
and
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
here,
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
i
doubt
anyone
will
dispute
is
vital
to
the
unions,
vital
to
all
unions,
to
their
effectiveness
as
collective
bargaining
agents.
we
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
makes
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
proscribe
the
union
disciplinary
conduct
here
involved.
and
that
the
limited
scope
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
confirmed
by
provisions
of
the
later
labor
management
reporting
in
disclosure
act
of
1959,
as
well
as
by
practical
considerations
of
effective
unionism
within
the
context
of
the
federal
labor
laws.
we
also
contend
that
no
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
established
because
the
fined
union
member
employees
were
not
deprived
of
any
right
protected
by
section
7
since
they
had
already
opted
against
refraining
from
concerted
activities
by
merely
being
members
of
--
becoming
members
of
the
union.
we
acknowledge
of
course
that
the
fine
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
anything,
but
they
have
agreed
by
joining
the
union
to
be
governed
by
majority
rule
of
that
union.
and
they
had
the
choice
of
submitting
the
majority
rule
of
the
union
or
to
take
the
other
way
and
just
pay
their
dues.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
think
that
under
the
provision,
the
provision
says
unbecoming
to
union
activities,
and
in
a
period
of
a
strike
where
everything
is
very
sensitive,
it
would
be
up
to
the
union
board
to
decide
as
to
whether
that
was
within
the
provision
of
the
union
constitution.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
which
according
to,
mr.
justice
harlan,
by
how
they
went
about
to
persuading.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
they
in
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
by
arguing
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that
offhand,
but
if
they
interfered
with
the
pickets
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
according
to
where
they
did
the
arguing.
if
they
argued
in
the
home
or
if
they
argued
in
some
place
away
from
the
plant,
if
they
argued
in
the
bar
or
the
poolroom
or
any
place
else,
i
think
that's
freedom
of
speech,
but
if
they're
arguing
and
disrupting
the
picket
line
that
will
be
distracting
--
disrupting
the
concerted
action
of
the
union.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
that
point
i
don't
--
we
--
we've
been
thinking
about
that
and
i
couldn't
find
any
cases
at
all
on
that.
i
don't
think
that's
ever
occurred,
my
devout
and
just
never
heard
of
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there's
a
difference
between
the
freedom
of
speech
and
deliberately
going
through
a
picket
line
and
going
to
work.
the
difference
is
you
are
interfering
with
the
majority
rule.
their
point,
their
position
should've
been
done
on
the
floor
of
the
union
hall
when
the
strike
both
was
being
taken.
that
was
where
they
should've
used
their
freedom
of
speech,
their
power
of
persuasion
and
what
have
you.
but
once
you
use
your
power
of
persuasion
and
use
your
power
of
speech
within
the
union
meeting
and
the
majority
votes
to
go
on
strike
then
it's
a
union
member's
duty
to
support
that
strike.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
says
to
the
contrary
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
section
7
says
he
has
a
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
it,
but
he
does
not
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
and
he
also
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
and
he
also
has
a
right
to
be
fined
for
it,
i
submit.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
necessarily.
not
necessarily,
i
--
i
know
of
people
who
have
exercised
their
right,
knowing
they
were
going
to
be
punished
for
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
either
and
i
see
nothing
wrong.
the
thing
you've
got
to
bear
in
mind
in
this
is
that
when
the
taft-hartley
bill
was
being
considered,
they
were
not
interfering
with
anything
that
was
normal
union
procedure
except
what
they
specifically
dealt
with.
there's
not
one
word
in
there
about
interfering
with
the
union's
right
to
maintain
discipline
within
the
union.
and
a
breakdown
of
discipline
within
a
union
destroys
not
only
the
union.
it
destroys
the
balance
of
the
labor
management
situation.
and
indeed
congress
wants
to
protect
that
rather
than
to
cut
down
on
it
so
i
say
that's
the
balance
that
was
struck.
they
could
very
well
have
said
that
if
you
exert
your
right
to
work
by
crossing
the
picket
line,
the
union
can
do
nothing.
indeed
they
did
say
that
the
union
could
not,
if
the
man
cross
the
picket
line
at
work,
the
union
could
not
destroy
his
--
his
employment
status.
they
said
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i've
been
saying,
they
can
expel
him.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
the
--
i'm
sure
congress
didn't
mean
that
because
number
one
from
practice
therefore
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
--
that's
one
argument
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
and
the
other
is
i
don't
know
of
any
--
find
a
way
to
destroy
union
than
to
expel
members.
if
you
expel
enough
of
them,
you're
without
a
union.
so
i
mean
the
union
is
protected
itself.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
difference
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
brennan,
where
we
have
a
difference
here
is
that
the
fine
is
beyond
expelling
to
the
contrary.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
is.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so.
what
we
try
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
if
you're
expelled,
you
lose
strike
benefits,
you
lose
this,
you
lose
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there's
nothing
in
the
record
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
to
show.
you
don't
lose
your
job
that
you
can
not
do.
that's
good.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
there's
nothing
in
there
to
say
you're
not
subject
to
fines.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
you
wouldn't
be
subject
to
fines
thereafter.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i
don't
know
whether
it's
enough
from
the
pocket
because
i
--
i
submit
mr.
justice
white,
let's
get
to
the
original,
the
main
thing.
when
you
go
into
the
you
--
when
you
work
in
a
plant
that's
under
a
contract
of
this
type,
you
know
you
have
to
pay
union
dues.
that's
--
that
you
know.
and
then
you
also
know
that
without
paying
anything
more,
you
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
use
your
voice
to
how
your
money
is
going
to
be
spent,
namely
join
the
union.
and
in
return
you
take
on
these
liabilities
of
being
governed
by
the
union
constitution.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
so
it's
a
give
and
take
all
the
way
through.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
say
it
is
coercion
and
it's
specifically
coercion
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
solidarity
necessary
for
union
to
operate.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
congress
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
congress
was
talking
about
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
fight
and
the
violence
and
all
of
those.
that's
what
congress
was
talking.
that's
the
type
of
coercion,
i
mean
congress
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
covers
all
coercion
like
if
you
say
--
i
guess
it
could
be
coercion
to
say
"you
know
i
wouldn't
do
that
if
i
were
you".
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
union
contract
--
the
union
constitution
says
if
they
don't
pay
the
fine
they
are
subject
to
expulsion.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
language
says
that
--
no
it
doesn't
say
it
could
do
anything
it
says
you
can't
(voice
overlap).
mr.
thurgood
marshall
fines
in
it
--
i'll
see
if
we
can
find
it
for
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
wisconsin
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
a
--
i
understand
that
that
is
the
reason
for
filing
the
suit
in
wisconsin,
i
understand
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
whether
they
could
coerce?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
threatening.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
what
was
done
and
that
was
the
reason
for
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
mr.
justice
brennan,
we're
trying
to
find
it
but
it
was
between
21
and
26.
i
would
like
to
now
move
over
to
the
case
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
versus
drivers
local
639,
the
curtis
brothers
case,
which
is
in
our
brief.
and
in
there
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
decided
--
determined
by
this
court
on
the
basis
that
you
couldn't
do
it
by
examining
the
language
alone,
and
that's
really
what
happened
in
the
seventh
circuit.
in
curtis,
you
recalled,
was
held
at
peaceful
recognitional
picketing
by
a
minority
union.
it
was
not
prohibited
by
that
section,
notwithstanding
that
such
picketing
tended
in
the
literal
sense
to
restrain
or
coerce
curtis'
employees
in
exercise
of
their
section
7
right.
and
in
so
holding,
this
court
stressed
the
basic
congressional
purpose
in
the
labor
act,
and
the
balance
and
compromise
reflected
in
it
intent
which
is
not
necessary
made
clear
in
the
vague
language.
now,
as
to
the
particular
action
here,
there
are
certain
things
that
i
believe
there
can
be
little
disagreement
with.
the
membership
in
the
union
is
not
compulsory
in
this
case.
secondly,
that
the
allegiance
to
a
duly
authorized
economic
strike
is
a
very
basis
in
any
union
activities.
and
where
reasonable
fines
are
often
made,
there
are
much
less
rigorous,
less
coercive
if
you
please
than
summary
expulsion.
and
then
the
policy
of
the
act
in
question
here
is
to
aid
collective
bargaining,
and
in
aid
to
collective
bargaining
requires
that
the
union
maintain
as
much
solidarity
as
it
can
do.
i
say
secondly
that
from
the
outset
the
board
has
held
that
--
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
does
not
prohibit
union
disciplinary
sanctions
that
are
neither
tinged
with
violence
nor
directed
at
employment
status,
and
would
seek
to
compel
union
members
to
comply
with
reasonable
and
legitimate
union
policies,
or
to
use
an
old
trite
phrase
as
long
as
you
use
in
legitimate
means
for
the
legitimate
end.
the
board
has
been
able
to
find
that
there
is
no
violation.
implicit
in
this
gain
is
a
principle
of
course
as
i've
mentioned
on
majority
rule,
and
we
bear
that
the
history
of
the
bill
when
senator
ball,
which
we
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
24,
said.
as
to
what
rights
were
being
impaired
and
what
rights
were
not
being
impaired?
senator
ball
said,
"all
we
are
trying
to
cover
is
the
coercive
and
restraining
action
of
the
union
in
its
efforts
to
organize
unorganized
employees".
and
he
also
said,
"what
we
are
talking
about
is
threats
of
violence
or
reprisal
and
that
sort
of
thing
in
an
organizational
campaign
or
perhaps
in
an
organizational
strike".
both
of
those
statements
emphasize
they're
talking
about
organizational
strikes
and
they're
talking
about
violence.
the
meaning
of
the
old
point
is
that
for
example
no
one
questions
the
propriety
of
fines
for
violations
of
a
no-strike
vote,
similarly
no
one
questions
that
a
union
might
expel
a
member
who
violates
a
strike
called
by
the
union
members,
in
any
rational
purpose
served
by
permitting
expulsion
but
still
prohibiting
fines.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
two.
this
means
chosen
a
fine
and
collection
of
it
in
the
courts
is
a
very
antithesis
of
the
type
of
oppression
tactics
that
we
were
talking
about.
the
issue
may
be
approached
on
the
other
hand
by
saying
that
the
union's
action
did
not
violate
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and
our
difference
is
with
the
court
below
that
the
court
below
says,
"read
the
statute
and
coercion
means
coercion".
we
prefer
to
rely
upon
the
board's
ruling
and
the
decision
of
the
original
panel
which
seems
to
say
this.
one,
the
nlrb
board's
opinion,
that
its
holding
was
specifically
restricted
to
an
area
involving
the
status
of
the
member
of
the
union
rather
than
as
an
employee
of
the
plant.
secondly,
the
board
emphasized
that
the
fine
is
restricted
to
its
own
members.
third,
the
board
says,
"the
rule
prohibiting
crossing
picket
lines
is
certainly
within
the
covenants
of
the
union".
it
involves
a
loyalty
of
its
members
during
a
time
of
crisis
for
the
union.
and
finally
the
board's
opinion
says,
"when
the
strike
is
lawful
and
the
picket
line
is
lawful,
we
cannot
hold
that
a
union
must
take
no
steps
to
preserve
its
own
integrity".
i
submit
that
in
the
position
of
the
board
in
this
case,
it
is
one
that
there
is
no
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
that
insofar
as
section
7
is
concerned,
it
merely
emphasizes
that
position.
and
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
can
hold
my
five
minutes?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there's
one
thing
we
should
get
straight
on
because
there's
so
much
that
there's
been
argued
that's
not
in
the
record,
and
for
example
this
question
of
these
men
being
dragooned
into
the
union.
we
have
in
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief,
the
opinion
of
the
intermediary
court
in
wisconsin.
and
i
understand
from
allis-chalmers
that
that
case
is
being
completely
and
thoroughly
litigated.
and
in
that
you'll
see
on
page
41
of
our
brief
the
facts
that
show
that
this
particular
man,
the
test
case
on
the
question
of
not
being
able
to
get
out
of
the
union,
and
granting
that
you
can
only
get
out
of
the
union
in
the
last
ten
days
of
the
year.
he
was
taken
into
the
union
in
1955.
he
could've
left
in
1956
or
1957.
and
the
strike
both
was
made
in
august
of
1958,
and
of
all
these
things
that
are
being
charged
that
these
members
didn't
know
about,
the
court
of
appeals
in
wisconsin
found
that
he
was
present
at
the
meeting
where
the
strike
vote
was
taken
--
vote
was
taken.
and
it
was
taken
in
august
of
1958.
he
could
have
gotten
out
december
21
of
1958,
because
the
strike
wasn't
called
until
1959.
so
i
think
that
i
have
to
add
that
to
the
other
points
and
bring
about
what
we
are
not
talking
about,
or
rather
what
this
case
is
not
about.
this
is
the
allis-chalmers
case.
it
doesn't
involve
the
high
exorbitant
fines
on
anybody.
fines
range
from
$20
to
$100
per
man.
it
doesn't
involve
freedom
of
speech,
and
it
doesn't
involve
involuntary
membership.
there
is
not
one
word
in
this
record
to
support
any
argument
about
involuntary
membership.
there
is
not
one
word
that
i've
been
able
to
find
in
this
record
that
supports
a
statement
that
the
man
never
even
got
a
constitution
of
the
union.
i
don't
know
where
that
comes
from
maybe
it's
in
one
of
the
other
records.
but
he
did
attend
the
strike
meeting.
now,
i
say
there's
nothing
in
this
record
as
to
any
of
the
other
men
except
the
stipulation
that
they
were
all
union
members.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
because
so
much
adversary
seems
to
say
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
takes
the
position
about
7,
we
don't.
we
think
7
is
a
part
of
8
and
we
take
the
position
you
don't
have
to
get
to
7
or
the
proviso
in
order
to
uphold
the
board
in
this
particular
case.
we
rely
of
course
on
8
and
we
view
7
as
a
part
of
the
8
provision.
and
unless
there
are
other
questions,
we
will
submit
urging
the
court
to
reverse
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
may
be
that
the
--
it
may
be
that
--
that
it's
not
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
the
unfair
labor
practice
to
it,
but
section
7
might
still
nevertheless
prevent
the
collection
of
the
fines
that
goes,
i
mean
logically
might.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
might
prevent
the
collection
of
the
fine,
you
mean
in
the
common
law
court?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
can't
conceive
of
it.
all
of
the
fines
i'd
known
that
had
not
been
collected
had
been
for
other
reasons,
not
for
that.
reasons
that
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
constitution
that
was
unreasonable
or
unprecedented
or
that
the
union
had
not
afforded
the
necessary
due
process,
those
i
want
to
know
about.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
not
req
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
you
don't
need
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
need
the
proviso
in
order
to
find
that
this
is
not
an
8
(b)
(1)
violation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
being
that
this
was
left
to
the
union
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
act
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
it's
--
it's
our
position,
it's
much
the
same,
but
our
position
is
that
there's
whether
or
not
the
man
be
voluntarily
a
member
of
the
union
or
went
in
there
automatic
whatever
it
is,
has
nothing
to
do
with
provision
that
it's
alright
for
the
union
to
do
this.
it
might
be
a
violation
of
something
else.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
don't
know
of
any
statute
wherein
the
statute
says
it's
alright.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
it's
not
a
violation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
we
rely
on
it
to
say
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
--
this
section
8
was
never
intended
to
prevent
this
apart
of
that
reason
that
we
say
it
wasn't
intended
to
prevent
it
is
the
proviso.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
review
of
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
where
that
court
sitting
en
banc
in
a
four
to
three
vote,
the
national
labor
relations
board
dismissed
of
unfair
labor
practice
charged
by
the
allis-chalmers
company
against
two
locals
of
the
united
automobile
workers
union.
this
was
based
on
the
unions
imposing
fines
upon
union
members
who
crossed
the
union
picket
lines
during
several
two
strikes.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
locals
248
and
401
of
the
uaw
for
many
years
represented
the
employees
of
allis-chalmers,
two
plants
in
particular,
the
west
allis
and
the
la
crosse
both
in
wisconsin
plants.
in
1959
and
again
in
1962,
each
of
these
locals
called
economic
strikes
against
the
company
in
furtherance
of
its
contract
demands.
the
1959
strike
lasted
about
two
months,
from
february
2
to
april
19
and
during
that
strike,
175
employees
out
of
a
unit
of
some
7400
crossed
the
picket
lines
at
west
allis,
and
two
at
la
crosse.
the
1962
strike
lasted
about
a
week
and
during
that
strike,
30
out
of
a
unit
of
5500
or
so
crossed
the
line.
in
accordance
with
the
procedure
specified
in
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws,
these
strike
working
members
were
found
by
union
trial
board
to
have
engaged
in
"conduct
unbecoming
a
union
member"
and
they
were
fined
amounts
ranging
from
$20
to
$100
each.
some
members
paid
the
fines
and
others
refused
to
pay.
and
the
union
commenced
actions
and
to
collect
the
fines
in
the
state
courts
in
wisconsin,
and
one
case
was
used
as
a
test
case,
and
the
union
obtained
the
judgment
against
a
member
who
had
crossed
the
line
and
had
refused
to
pay
the
fine.
and
the
opinion
of
the
wisconsin
intermediate
appellate
court
which
upheld
this
judgment
of
the
trial
court
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief.
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
is
not
in
our
record
but
it
is
in
the
record
that's
deposited
with
the
court.
this
particular
case
is
now
pending
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
and
so
far
as
i
know
it's
not
yet
been
decided.
none
of
the
strike-making
members
has
been
expelled.
none
of
them
had
been
suspended
from
the
union,
nor
if
any
of
them
resigned
because
of
the
fines.
on
the
other
hand,
the
union
has
done
nothing
whatsoever
in
any
way
to
affect
the
employment
status
of
these
members
who
were
fined.
and
so
the
question
here
is
whether
the
union
fining
of
these
members
for
crossing
the
picket
line
and
the
subsequent
attempt
to
collect
the
fines
by
court
action
constitutes
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
employees
and
the
exercise
of
a
right
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
act.
section
7
in
turn
gives
employees
the
right
both
to
engage
and
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
union
activities.
the
board
itself
where
its
member
lead
them
dissenting,
held
that
the
union
conduct
complained
of
by
the
company
did
not
violate
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
and
upon
the
company's
petition
for
review
to
the
seventh
circuit,
a
panel
of
judges,
judges
kiley,
judge
knoch
and
judge
castle
upheld
the
board's
dismissal
of
the
charges.
upon
rehearing
on
en
banc,
the
court
withdrew
the
panel's
original
decision
and
held
with
chief
judge
hastings
and
judges
kiley
and
swygert
dissenting
that
the
union
action
did
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
act.
the
court
accordingly
set
aside
the
board's
order
and
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
here,
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
i
doubt
anyone
will
dispute
is
vital
to
the
unions,
vital
to
all
unions,
to
their
effectiveness
as
collective
bargaining
agents.
we
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
makes
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
proscribe
the
union
disciplinary
conduct
here
involved.
and
that
the
limited
scope
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
confirmed
by
provisions
of
the
later
labor
management
reporting
in
disclosure
act
of
1959,
as
well
as
by
practical
considerations
of
effective
unionism
within
the
context
of
the
federal
labor
laws.
we
also
contend
that
no
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
established
because
the
fined
union
member
employees
were
not
deprived
of
any
right
protected
by
section
7
since
they
had
already
opted
against
refraining
from
concerted
activities
by
merely
being
members
of
--
becoming
members
of
the
union.
we
acknowledge
of
course
that
the
fine
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
anything,
but
they
have
agreed
by
joining
the
union
to
be
governed
by
majority
rule
of
that
union.
and
they
had
the
choice
of
submitting
the
majority
rule
of
the
union
or
to
take
the
other
way
and
just
pay
their
dues.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
think
that
under
the
provision,
the
provision
says
unbecoming
to
union
activities,
and
in
a
period
of
a
strike
where
everything
is
very
sensitive,
it
would
be
up
to
the
union
board
to
decide
as
to
whether
that
was
within
the
provision
of
the
union
constitution.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
which
according
to,
mr.
justice
harlan,
by
how
they
went
about
to
persuading.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
they
in
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
by
arguing
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that
offhand,
but
if
they
interfered
with
the
pickets
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
according
to
where
they
did
the
arguing.
if
they
argued
in
the
home
or
if
they
argued
in
some
place
away
from
the
plant,
if
they
argued
in
the
bar
or
the
poolroom
or
any
place
else,
i
think
that's
freedom
of
speech,
but
if
they're
arguing
and
disrupting
the
picket
line
that
will
be
distracting
--
disrupting
the
concerted
action
of
the
union.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
that
point
i
don't
--
we
--
we've
been
thinking
about
that
and
i
couldn't
find
any
cases
at
all
on
that.
i
don't
think
that's
ever
occurred,
my
devout
and
just
never
heard
of
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there's
a
difference
between
the
freedom
of
speech
and
deliberately
going
through
a
picket
line
and
going
to
work.
the
difference
is
you
are
interfering
with
the
majority
rule.
their
point,
their
position
should've
been
done
on
the
floor
of
the
union
hall
when
the
strike
both
was
being
taken.
that
was
where
they
should've
used
their
freedom
of
speech,
their
power
of
persuasion
and
what
have
you.
but
once
you
use
your
power
of
persuasion
and
use
your
power
of
speech
within
the
union
meeting
and
the
majority
votes
to
go
on
strike
then
it's
a
union
member's
duty
to
support
that
strike.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
says
to
the
contrary
that
i
know
of.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
section
7
says
he
has
a
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
it,
but
he
does
not
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
and
he
also
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
and
he
also
has
a
right
to
be
fined
for
it,
i
submit.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
necessarily.
not
necessarily,
i
--
i
know
of
people
who
have
exercised
their
right,
knowing
they
were
going
to
be
punished
for
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
either
and
i
see
nothing
wrong.
the
thing
you've
got
to
bear
in
mind
in
this
is
that
when
the
taft-hartley
bill
was
being
considered,
they
were
not
interfering
with
anything
that
was
normal
union
procedure
except
what
they
specifically
dealt
with.
there's
not
one
word
in
there
about
interfering
with
the
union's
right
to
maintain
discipline
within
the
union.
and
a
breakdown
of
discipline
within
a
union
destroys
not
only
the
union.
it
destroys
the
balance
of
the
labor
management
situation.
and
indeed
congress
wants
to
protect
that
rather
than
to
cut
down
on
it
so
i
say
that's
the
balance
that
was
struck.
they
could
very
well
have
said
that
if
you
exert
your
right
to
work
by
crossing
the
picket
line,
the
union
can
do
nothing.
indeed
they
did
say
that
the
union
could
not,
if
the
man
cross
the
picket
line
at
work,
the
union
could
not
destroy
his
--
his
employment
status.
they
said
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i've
been
saying,
they
can
expel
him.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
the
--
i'm
sure
congress
didn't
mean
that
because
number
one
from
practice
therefore
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
--
that's
one
argument
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
and
the
other
is
i
don't
know
of
any
--
find
a
way
to
destroy
union
than
to
expel
members.
if
you
expel
enough
of
them,
you're
without
a
union.
so
i
mean
the
union
is
protected
itself.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
difference
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
brennan,
where
we
have
a
difference
here
is
that
the
fine
is
beyond
expelling
to
the
contrary.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
is.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so.
what
we
try
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
if
you're
expelled,
you
lose
strike
benefits,
you
lose
this,
you
lose
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there's
nothing
in
the
record
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
to
show.
you
don't
lose
your
job
that
you
can
not
do.
that's
good.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
there's
nothing
in
there
to
say
you're
not
subject
to
fines.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
you
wouldn't
be
subject
to
fines
thereafter.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i
don't
know
whether
it's
enough
from
the
pocket
because
i
--
i
submit
mr.
justice
white,
let's
get
to
the
original,
the
main
thing.
when
you
go
into
the
you
--
when
you
work
in
a
plant
that's
under
a
contract
of
this
type,
you
know
you
have
to
pay
union
dues.
that's
--
that
you
know.
and
then
you
also
know
that
without
paying
anything
more,
you
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
use
your
voice
to
how
your
money
is
going
to
be
spent,
namely
join
the
union.
and
in
return
you
take
on
these
liabilities
of
being
governed
by
the
union
constitution.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
so
it's
a
give
and
take
all
the
way
through.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
say
it
is
coercion
and
it's
specifically
coercion
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
solidarity
necessary
for
union
to
operate.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
congress
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
congress
was
talking
about
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
fight
and
the
violence
and
all
of
those.
that's
what
congress
was
talking.
that's
the
type
of
coercion,
i
mean
congress
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
covers
all
coercion
like
if
you
say
--
i
guess
it
could
be
coercion
to
say
"you
know
i
wouldn't
do
that
if
i
were
you".
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
union
contract
--
the
union
constitution
says
if
they
don't
pay
the
fine
they
are
subject
to
expulsion.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
language
says
that
--
no
it
doesn't
say
it
could
do
anything
it
says
you
can't
(voice
overlap).
mr.
thurgood
marshall
fines
in
it
--
i'll
see
if
we
can
find
it
for
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
wisconsin
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
a
--
i
understand
that
that
is
the
reason
for
filing
the
suit
in
wisconsin,
i
understand
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
whether
they
could
coerce?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
threatening.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
what
was
done
and
that
was
the
reason
for
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
mr.
justice
brennan,
we're
trying
to
find
it
but
it
was
between
21
and
26.
i
would
like
to
now
move
over
to
the
case
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
versus
drivers
local
639,
the
curtis
brothers
case,
which
is
in
our
brief.
and
in
there
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
decided
--
determined
by
this
court
on
the
basis
that
you
couldn't
do
it
by
examining
the
language
alone,
and
that's
really
what
happened
in
the
seventh
circuit.
in
curtis,
you
recalled,
was
held
at
peaceful
recognitional
picketing
by
a
minority
union.
it
was
not
prohibited
by
that
section,
notwithstanding
that
such
picketing
tended
in
the
literal
sense
to
restrain
or
coerce
curtis'
employees
in
exercise
of
their
section
7
right.
and
in
so
holding,
this
court
stressed
the
basic
congressional
purpose
in
the
labor
act,
and
the
balance
and
compromise
reflected
in
it
intent
which
is
not
necessary
made
clear
in
the
vague
language.
now,
as
to
the
particular
action
here,
there
are
certain
things
that
i
believe
there
can
be
little
disagreement
with.
the
membership
in
the
union
is
not
compulsory
in
this
case.
secondly,
that
the
allegiance
to
a
duly
authorized
economic
strike
is
a
very
basis
in
any
union
activities.
and
where
reasonable
fines
are
often
made,
there
are
much
less
rigorous,
less
coercive
if
you
please
than
summary
expulsion.
and
then
the
policy
of
the
act
in
question
here
is
to
aid
collective
bargaining,
and
in
aid
to
collective
bargaining
requires
that
the
union
maintain
as
much
solidarity
as
it
can
do.
i
say
secondly
that
from
the
outset
the
board
has
held
that
--
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
does
not
prohibit
union
disciplinary
sanctions
that
are
neither
tinged
with
violence
nor
directed
at
employment
status,
and
would
seek
to
compel
union
members
to
comply
with
reasonable
and
legitimate
union
policies,
or
to
use
an
old
trite
phrase
as
long
as
you
use
in
legitimate
means
for
the
legitimate
end.
the
board
has
been
able
to
find
that
there
is
no
violation.
implicit
in
this
gain
is
a
principle
of
course
as
i've
mentioned
on
majority
rule,
and
we
bear
that
the
history
of
the
bill
when
senator
ball,
which
we
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
24,
said.
as
to
what
rights
were
being
impaired
and
what
rights
were
not
being
impaired?
senator
ball
said,
"all
we
are
trying
to
cover
is
the
coercive
and
restraining
action
of
the
union
in
its
efforts
to
organize
unorganized
employees".
and
he
also
said,
"what
we
are
talking
about
is
threats
of
violence
or
reprisal
and
that
sort
of
thing
in
an
organizational
campaign
or
perhaps
in
an
organizational
strike".
both
of
those
statements
emphasize
they're
talking
about
organizational
strikes
and
they're
talking
about
violence.
the
meaning
of
the
old
point
is
that
for
example
no
one
questions
the
propriety
of
fines
for
violations
of
a
no-strike
vote,
similarly
no
one
questions
that
a
union
might
expel
a
member
who
violates
a
strike
called
by
the
union
members,
in
any
rational
purpose
served
by
permitting
expulsion
but
still
prohibiting
fines.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
two.
this
means
chosen
a
fine
and
collection
of
it
in
the
courts
is
a
very
antithesis
of
the
type
of
oppression
tactics
that
we
were
talking
about.
the
issue
may
be
approached
on
the
other
hand
by
saying
that
the
union's
action
did
not
violate
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and
our
difference
is
with
the
court
below
that
the
court
below
says,
"read
the
statute
and
coercion
means
coercion".
we
prefer
to
rely
upon
the
board's
ruling
and
the
decision
of
the
original
panel
which
seems
to
say
this.
one,
the
nlrb
board's
opinion,
that
its
holding
was
specifically
restricted
to
an
area
involving
the
status
of
the
member
of
the
union
rather
than
as
an
employee
of
the
plant.
secondly,
the
board
emphasized
that
the
fine
is
restricted
to
its
own
members.
third,
the
board
says,
"the
rule
prohibiting
crossing
picket
lines
is
certainly
within
the
covenants
of
the
union".
it
involves
a
loyalty
of
its
members
during
a
time
of
crisis
for
the
union.
and
finally
the
board's
opinion
says,
"when
the
strike
is
lawful
and
the
picket
line
is
lawful,
we
cannot
hold
that
a
union
must
take
no
steps
to
preserve
its
own
integrity".
i
submit
that
in
the
position
of
the
board
in
this
case,
it
is
one
that
there
is
no
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
that
insofar
as
section
7
is
concerned,
it
merely
emphasizes
that
position.
and
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
can
hold
my
five
minutes?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there's
one
thing
we
should
get
straight
on
because
there's
so
much
that
there's
been
argued
that's
not
in
the
record,
and
for
example
this
question
of
these
men
being
dragooned
into
the
union.
we
have
in
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief,
the
opinion
of
the
intermediary
court
in
wisconsin.
and
i
understand
from
allis-chalmers
that
that
case
is
being
completely
and
thoroughly
litigated.
and
in
that
you'll
see
on
page
41
of
our
brief
the
facts
that
show
that
this
particular
man,
the
test
case
on
the
question
of
not
being
able
to
get
out
of
the
union,
and
granting
that
you
can
only
get
out
of
the
union
in
the
last
ten
days
of
the
year.
he
was
taken
into
the
union
in
1955.
he
could've
left
in
1956
or
1957.
and
the
strike
both
was
made
in
august
of
1958,
and
of
all
these
things
that
are
being
charged
that
these
members
didn't
know
about,
the
court
of
appeals
in
wisconsin
found
that
he
was
present
at
the
meeting
where
the
strike
vote
was
taken
--
vote
was
taken.
and
it
was
taken
in
august
of
1958.
he
could
have
gotten
out
december
21
of
1958,
because
the
strike
wasn't
called
until
1959.
so
i
think
that
i
have
to
add
that
to
the
other
points
and
bring
about
what
we
are
not
talking
about,
or
rather
what
this
case
is
not
about.
this
is
the
allis-chalmers
case.
it
doesn't
involve
the
high
exorbitant
fines
on
anybody.
fines
range
from
$20
to
$100
per
man.
it
doesn't
involve
freedom
of
speech,
and
it
doesn't
involve
involuntary
membership.
there
is
not
one
word
in
this
record
to
support
any
argument
about
involuntary
membership.
there
is
not
one
word
that
i've
been
able
to
find
in
this
record
that
supports
a
statement
that
the
man
never
even
got
a
constitution
of
the
union.
i
don't
know
where
that
comes
from
maybe
it's
in
one
of
the
other
records.
but
he
did
attend
the
strike
meeting.
now,
i
say
there's
nothing
in
this
record
as
to
any
of
the
other
men
except
the
stipulation
that
they
were
all
union
members.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
because
so
much
adversary
seems
to
say
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
takes
the
position
about
7,
we
don't.
we
think
7
is
a
part
of
8
and
we
take
the
position
you
don't
have
to
get
to
7
or
the
proviso
in
order
to
uphold
the
board
in
this
particular
case.
we
rely
of
course
on
8
and
we
view
7
as
a
part
of
the
8
provision.
and
unless
there
are
other
questions,
we
will
submit
urging
the
court
to
reverse
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
may
be
that
the
--
it
may
be
that
--
that
it's
not
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
the
unfair
labor
practice
to
it,
but
section
7
might
still
nevertheless
prevent
the
collection
of
the
fines
that
goes,
i
mean
logically
might.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
might
prevent
the
collection
of
the
fine,
you
mean
in
the
common
law
court?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
can't
conceive
of
it.
all
of
the
fines
i'd
known
that
had
not
been
collected
had
been
for
other
reasons,
not
for
that.
reasons
that
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
constitution
that
was
unreasonable
or
unprecedented
or
that
the
union
had
not
afforded
the
necessary
due
process,
those
i
want
to
know
about.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
not
req
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
you
don't
need
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
need
the
proviso
in
order
to
find
that
this
is
not
an
8
(b)
(1)
violation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
being
that
this
was
left
to
the
union
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
act
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
it's
--
it's
our
position,
it's
much
the
same,
but
our
position
is
that
there's
whether
or
not
the
man
be
voluntarily
a
member
of
the
union
or
went
in
there
automatic
whatever
it
is,
has
nothing
to
do
with
provision
that
it's
alright
for
the
union
to
do
this.
it
might
be
a
violation
of
something
else.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
don't
know
of
any
statute
wherein
the
statute
says
it's
alright.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
it's
not
a
violation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
we
rely
on
it
to
say
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
--
this
section
8
was
never
intended
to
prevent
this
apart
of
that
reason
that
we
say
it
wasn't
intended
to
prevent
it
is
the
proviso.
thank
you
sir.
