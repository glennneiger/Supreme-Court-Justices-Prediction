justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
is
that,
the
indiana
test
of
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that's
what
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
that's
so
when
the
--
when
he
was
found
guilty
of
reckless
homicide,
he
was
also
found
guilty
of
all
the
elements
of
involuntary
manslaughter,
wasn't
he?
he'd
be
--
how
can
you
possibly
say
then
that
he
was
acquitted
for
the
involuntary
manslaughter
if
he
was
found
guilty
of
every
element
that
it
took
to
make
up
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
really,
did
they
do
--
you
have
to
argue
that
silence
means
acquittal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
by
law
isn't
it
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
says
that
isn't
the
law
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
assume
there's
an
acquittal
on
--
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
you're
just
saying
that
they
were
acquitted
because
of
silence.
i
would
think
if
when
he
get
to
crimes
like
this
and
--
that
are
so
identical
if
you
say
they
are
that
the
normal
rule
of
silence
meaning
an
acquittal
might
not
hold.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
verdicts
are
inconsistent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
but
that's
not
--
that's
the
--
you're
just
using
a
presumption
there,
just
a
rule,
a
normal
rule
that
that
you
will
assume
there
was
an
acquittal
if
there
is
silence
by
the
jury.
and
here
there
isn't
a
silence
by
the
jury
as
to
involuntary
manslaughter
in
the
sense
that
they
--
they
find
guilty
of
every
elements
they
detect
to
make
it
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
--
i
think
you
answered
the
chief
justice
earlier
mr.
price
that
the
--
had
they
limited
the
weak
prosecution
to
the
prosecution
under
the
label
reckless
homicide,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
i
must
--
as
i
have
trouble
with,
if
the
test
of
double
jeopardy
is
prosecution
a
second
time
for
the
same
conduct
--
for
the
same
conduct,
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
they
--
if
they're
entitled
to
do
it
under
the
label
of
reckless
homicide,
why
would
they
be
entitled
to
do
it
under
the
--
on
the
label
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
can
say
--
at
least
you
have
to
say
in
your
case
that
the
jury
decided
it
would
not
punish
him
with
involuntary
manslaughter.
and
whatever
there
was
in
this
situation
the
jury
chose
not
to
purport
to
punish
him
from
involuntary
manslaughter.
at
least
the
--
they
didn't
--
all
they
found
was
a
reckless
homicide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
to
punish
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
--
they
didn't
think
that
he
had
conducted
himself
of
such
a
way
as
to
justify
a
penalty
up
to
20
years
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
mean
that
under
the
verdict
he
could
not
have
been
punish
more
than
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
jury
has
made
a
decision
that
he
should
not
be
punished
more
than
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
jury
told
about
the
penalties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
they
know
anything,
anything
at
all
about
the
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
jury
might
think
that
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever
what
we
find
him
guilty
of.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
price,
could
he
had
been
--
i
gather
it
could
have
been
convicted
under
both
counts
for
that
same
conduct?
the
jury
might
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
price,
i
gather
you
want
us
to
say
that
constitutionally
in
this
situation,
one,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
to
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
two,
and
you
want
us
to
say
secondly
that
the
action
of
the
jury
was
tantamount
to
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
reckless
homicide
and
an
acquittal
on
involuntary
manslaughter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you
want
us
to
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
you're
relying
on
green
i
don't
understand
how
we
can
avoid
reaching
that
second
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
asking
us
to
say
if
it
--
this
first
trial,
it
was
an
implied
acquittal
on
involuntary
manslaughter,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
gets
me
right
back
to
what
mr.
justice
black
asked
you
then.
then
i
don't
understand
why
he
can
be
put
to
trial
on
reckless
homicide?
as
you
concede
he
could
if
they
--
just
use
that
label
and
the
second
trial
and
you
told
us,
all
you
want
us
to
do
is
just
send
it
back
and
tell
them
maybe,
retrial
on
reckless
homicide.
i
would
really
think
you'd
be
saying
that
he
can't
be
retried
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
connection
may
i
ask,
i
noticed
your
supreme
court
that
in
saying
that
it
was
not
conclusively
as
an
implied
acquittal
that
they
do
that
especially
since
this
court
judicially
know
that
trail
court
practice
of
telling
jury
to
return
the
verdict
on
only
one
of
the
charges
in
view
of
the
limitation
on
penalty.
my
question
is,
was
this
jury
told
in
the
first
trial?
i
don't
see
it
in
the
(inaudible)
records.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
if
he
in
the
original
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
know
as
a
fact
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
jury
was
told
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
this,
suppose
or
may
you
do
this
in
indiana?
in
a
case
like
this
and
prosecute
him
only
for
reckless
homicide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may?
and
then
suppose
he's
acquitted,
may
you
thereafter
prosecute
him
for
an
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
could
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
mcfadden
from
what
you
answered
me
earlier
i
take
it
that
you
tried
him
initially
only
for
reckless
homicide
and
he
had
been
convicted.
you
interpret
your
supreme
court
as
holding
that
they
could
not
thereafter
have
prosecuted
him
for
involuntary
homicide?
that
is
--
whether
acquitted
or
convicted
if
prosecuted
only
for
reckless
homicide
that
he
could
not
thereafter
have
been
prosecuted
for
involuntary
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
this
really
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
my
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
never
charged
with
it
the
first
time
in
effect
you
say.
he
was
acquitted
because
he
ended
up
convicted
of
reckless
homicide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
don't
understand
why
if
he
was
never
charged
with
the
first
time
and
it
would
follow
and
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
involuntary
manslaughter
had
he
once
been
convicted
of
reckless
homicide,
then
why
is
in
fact
this
case
to
the
extent
of
the
attempt
on
the
second
go
around
to
prosecute
him
for
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
(inaudible)
whatever
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
sir
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
your
--
i
just
look
at
your
instruction
and
apparently
if
there's
to
be
a
verdict
of
acquittal
it
has
to
be
on
both.
he
can't
be
convicted
on
one
and
acquitted
on
the
other
as
i
read
those
instructions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
thing
you
can
do
apparently
from
those
instructions
which
are
very
detailed
is
to
the
forms
of
verdicts
that
may
be
brought
in.
you
may
find
him,
if
you
find
him
guilty
generally
than
the
higher
offenses,
the
higher
punishments
imposed.
but
the
jury's
given
a
choice
to
--
itself
to
elect
if
they're
going
to
find
him
guilty
at
all,
whether
they're
going
to
find
him
guilty
of
the
lesser
--
that
carrying
a
lesser
penalty
or
of
that
carrying
a
greater
penalty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
a
general.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mcfadden,
looking
again
at
the
instruction
which
is
certainly
detailed
that
sets
out
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
and
instructs
the
jury
you
may
answer
one
of
these
and
no
more.
and
the
first
one
as
i
recall
it
is
if
you
are
to
find
him
guilty
generally
you
just
find,
say
yes.
guilty
generally
and
then
as
a
matter
of
law
there
told
that
carries
the
higher
penalty
and
number
two
is
if
you
want
to
find
him
guilty
of
reckless
homicide
fill
in
this,
the
answers
to
these
questions
and
that
carries
such
and
such
a
penalty.
number
three
is,
if
you
want
to
find
him
guilty
of
involuntary
manslaughter
fill
in
this
question,
the
answers
to
these
questions
and
then
they
carry
such
and
such
a
penalty.
now,
why
is
--
why
didn't
the
jury
deliberately
make
a
choice
here?
when
it
filled
in
the
answers
to
the
questions
on
reckless
homicide,
why
isn't
that
exactly
like
green
as
in
--
as
implying
a
rejection
or
an
acquittal
on
the
basis
of
the
involuntary
homicide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
but
here
the
jury
--
actually
here
the
jury's
given
a
choice.
the
jury
may
find
reckless
homicide
or
involuntary
manslaughter
or
a
jungle
verdict
of
guilty.
they're
given
those
three
choices
and
among
the
three
the
(inaudible)
the
reckless
homicide.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
rejection
by
the
jury
in
the
sense
of
an
acquittal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
other
two
choices?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
this
jury
rejected
both,
it
rejected
both
the
general
verdict
which
would
have
carried
the
manslaughter
penalty
and
it
rejected
the
involuntary
manslaughter
count
specifically
and
chose
specifically
the
reckless
homicide.
this
is
on
the
first
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
distinction
for
green
is
that
the
premeditated
murder
carries
an
element
different
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
second
degree
murder.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
here
--
here
neither,
all
--
both
offenses
carried
the
same
element.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
don't
you
still
have
to
get
around
the
--
you're
arguing
now
that
the
--
at
your
conviction,
your
second
conviction
for
reckless
homicide
to
be
set
aside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
is
that,
the
indiana
test
of
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that's
what
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
that's
so
when
the
--
when
he
was
found
guilty
of
reckless
homicide,
he
was
also
found
guilty
of
all
the
elements
of
involuntary
manslaughter,
wasn't
he?
he'd
be
--
how
can
you
possibly
say
then
that
he
was
acquitted
for
the
involuntary
manslaughter
if
he
was
found
guilty
of
every
element
that
it
took
to
make
up
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
really,
did
they
do
--
you
have
to
argue
that
silence
means
acquittal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
by
law
isn't
it
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
says
that
isn't
the
law
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
assume
there's
an
acquittal
on
--
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
you're
just
saying
that
they
were
acquitted
because
of
silence.
i
would
think
if
when
he
get
to
crimes
like
this
and
--
that
are
so
identical
if
you
say
they
are
that
the
normal
rule
of
silence
meaning
an
acquittal
might
not
hold.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
verdicts
are
inconsistent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
but
that's
not
--
that's
the
--
you're
just
using
a
presumption
there,
just
a
rule,
a
normal
rule
that
that
you
will
assume
there
was
an
acquittal
if
there
is
silence
by
the
jury.
and
here
there
isn't
a
silence
by
the
jury
as
to
involuntary
manslaughter
in
the
sense
that
they
--
they
find
guilty
of
every
elements
they
detect
to
make
it
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
--
i
think
you
answered
the
chief
justice
earlier
mr.
price
that
the
--
had
they
limited
the
weak
prosecution
to
the
prosecution
under
the
label
reckless
homicide,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
i
must
--
as
i
have
trouble
with,
if
the
test
of
double
jeopardy
is
prosecution
a
second
time
for
the
same
conduct
--
for
the
same
conduct,
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
they
--
if
they're
entitled
to
do
it
under
the
label
of
reckless
homicide,
why
would
they
be
entitled
to
do
it
under
the
--
on
the
label
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
can
say
--
at
least
you
have
to
say
in
your
case
that
the
jury
decided
it
would
not
punish
him
with
involuntary
manslaughter.
and
whatever
there
was
in
this
situation
the
jury
chose
not
to
purport
to
punish
him
from
involuntary
manslaughter.
at
least
the
--
they
didn't
--
all
they
found
was
a
reckless
homicide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
to
punish
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
--
they
didn't
think
that
he
had
conducted
himself
of
such
a
way
as
to
justify
a
penalty
up
to
20
years
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
mean
that
under
the
verdict
he
could
not
have
been
punish
more
than
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
jury
has
made
a
decision
that
he
should
not
be
punished
more
than
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
jury
told
about
the
penalties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
would
they

no

what
we
find
him
guilty
of.
justice
william

mr.

could
he
had
been
--
i
gather
it
could
have
been
convicted
under
both
counts
for
that
same
conduct?
the
jury
might

justice

but
you're

this

it

aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
gets
me
right
back
to
what
mr.
justice
black
asked
you
then.
then
i
don't
understand
why
he
can
be
put
to
trial
on
reckless
homicide?
as
you
concede
he
could
if
they
--
just
use
that
label
and
the
second
trial
and
you
told
us,
all
you
want
us
to
do
is
just
send
it
back
and
tell
them
maybe,
retrial
on
reckless
homicide.
i
would
really
think
you'd
be
saying
that
he
can't
be
retried
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
connection
may
i
ask,
i
noticed
your
supreme
court
that
in
saying
that
it
was
not
conclusively
as
an
implied
acquittal
that
they
do
that
especially
since
this
court
judicially
know
that
trail
court
practice
of
telling
jury
to
return
the
verdict
on
only
one
of
the
charges
in
view
of
the
limitation
on
penalty.
my
question
is,
was
this
jury
told
in
the
first
trial?
i
don't
see
it
in
the
(inaudible)
records.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
if
he
in
the
original
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
know
as
a
fact
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
jury
was
told
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
this,
suppose
or
may
you
do
this
in
indiana?
in
a
case
like
this
and
prosecute
him
only
for
reckless
homicide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may?
and
then
suppose
he's
acquitted,
may
you
thereafter
prosecute
him
for
an
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
could
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
mcfadden
from
what
you
answered
me
earlier
i
take
it
that
you
tried
him
initially
only
for
reckless
homicide
and
he
had
been
convicted.
you
interpret
your
supreme
court
as
holding
that
they
could
not
thereafter
have
prosecuted
him
for
involuntary
homicide?
that
is
--
whether
acquitted
or
convicted
if
prosecuted
only
for
reckless
homicide
that
he
could
not
thereafter
have
been
prosecuted
for
involuntary
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
this
really
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
my
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
never
charged
with
it
the
first
time
in
effect
you
say.
he
was
acquitted
because
he
ended
up
convicted
of
reckless
homicide.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
don't
understand
why
if
he
was
never
charged
with
the
first
time
and
it
would
follow
and
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
involuntary
manslaughter
had
he
once
been
convicted
of
reckless
homicide,
then
why
is
in
fact
this
case
to
the
extent
of
the
attempt
on
the
second
go
around
to
prosecute
him
for
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
(inaudible)
whatever
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
sir
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
your
--
i
just
look
at
your
instruction
and
apparently
if
there's
to
be
a
verdict
of
acquittal
it
has
to
be
on
both.
he
can't
be
convicted
on
one
and
acquitted
on
the
other
as
i
read
those
instructions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
thing
you
can
do
apparently
from
those
instructions
which
are
very
detailed
is
to
the
forms
of
verdicts
that
may
be
brought
in.
you
may
find
him,
if
you
find
him
guilty
generally
than
the
higher
offenses,
the
higher
punishments
imposed.
but
the
jury's
given
a
choice
to
--
itself
to
elect
if
they're
going
to
find
him
guilty
at
all,
whether
they're
going
to
find
him
guilty
of
the
lesser
--
that
carrying
a
lesser
penalty
or
of
that
carrying
a
greater
penalty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
a
general.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mcfadden,
looking
again
at
the
instruction
which
is
certainly
detailed
that
sets
out
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
and
instructs
the
jury
you
may
answer
one
of
these
and
no
more.
and
the
first
one
as
i
recall
it
is
if
you
are
to
find
him
guilty
generally
you
just
find,
say
yes.
guilty
generally
and
then
as
a
matter
of
law
there
told
that
carries
the
higher
penalty
and
number
two
is
if
you
want
to
find
him
guilty
of
reckless
homicide
fill
in
this,
the
answers
to
these
questions
and
that
carries
such
and
such
a
penalty.
number
three
is,
if
you
want
to
find
him
guilty
of
involuntary
manslaughter
fill
in
this
question,
the
answers
to
these
questions
and
then
they
carry
such
and
such
a
penalty.
now,
why
is
--
why
didn't
the
jury
deliberately
make
a
choice
here?
when
it
filled
in
the
answers
to
the
questions
on
reckless
homicide,
why
isn't
that
exactly
like
green
as
in
--
as
implying
a
rejection
or
an
acquittal
on
the
basis
of
the
involuntary
homicide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
but
here
the
jury
--
actually
here
the
jury's
given
a
choice.
the
jury
may
find
reckless
homicide
or
involuntary
manslaughter
or
a
jungle
verdict
of
guilty.
they're
given
those
three
choices
and
among
the
three
the
(inaudible)
the
reckless
homicide.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
rejection
by
the
jury
in
the
sense
of
an
acquittal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
other
two
choices?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
this
jury
rejected
both,
it
rejected
both
the
general
verdict
which
would
have
carried
the
manslaughter
penalty
and
it
rejected
the
involuntary
manslaughter
count
specifically
and
chose
specifically
the
reckless
homicide.
this
is
on
the
first
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
distinction
for
green
is
that
the
premeditated
murder
carries
an
element
different
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
second
degree
murder.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
here
--
here
neither,
all
--
both
offenses
carried
the
same
element.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
don't
you
still
have
to
get
around
the
--
you're
arguing
now
that
the
--
at
your
conviction,
your
second
conviction
for
reckless
homicide
to
be
set
aside?
