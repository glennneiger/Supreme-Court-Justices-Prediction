mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
move
the
admission
pro
hac
vice
of
my
adversary
mr.
douglas
mcfadden,
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
indiana.
i
would
so
move
his
admission
if
i
could
sir.
the
issue
presented
by
the
instance
case
pertains
to
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
protection
against
double
jeopardy.
specifically
we
have
asked
this
court
to
revisit
the
decision
of
palko
versus
connecticut.
specifically
this
case
then
concerned
itself
with
whether
the
protection
against
double
jeopardy
is
of
such
statute
so
as
to
be
immune
from
state
encroachment
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
charged
in
two
counts,
the
first
was
the
violation
in
indiana
of
the
crime
of
reckless
homicide
and
then
the
second
count,
the
offense
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
after
a
lengthy
trial
the
petitioner
was
convicted
only
of
the
crime
of
reckless
homicide
and
the
jury
returned
no
verdict
on
the
count
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
although
we
submit
it's
not
really
germane
to
the
academic
question
here,
it
is
well
settled
in
indiana
that
jury
silence
on
account
is
tantamount
to
an
acquittal.
so
i
submit
that
in
every
legal
effect
this
petitioner
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
reckless
homicide
and
acquitted
of
the
crime
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
no.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir
it
is
not.
the
offenses
are
qualitatively
identical.
neither
is
included
in
the
other.
they're
horizontal
as
opposed
to
vertical
offenses.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
with
this
exception
mr.
justice
harlan
insofar
as
it
applies
to
motor
vehicle
deaths.
mr.
john
p.
price
which
this
case
is
concerned
with,
yes.
insofar
as
this
case
in
motor
vehicle
deaths
are
concerned,
these
two
offenses
are
qualitatively
identical.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
reckless
homicide
statute
does
provide
a
lesser
--
mr.
john
p.
price
punishment
or
at
least
the
indeterminate
sentence
starts
earlier,
one
to
five
as
oppose
to
the
2
to
21
under
the
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice,
there
is
another
statute
in
indiana
which
i
think
recognizes
the
very
double
jeopardy
features
that
we're
submitting
to
you
today.
in
that
it
provides
these
two
counts
may
be
joined
in
one
indictment
or
affidavit.
the
trial
then
can
concur
simultaneously
as
to
both.
it
goes
on
to
point
out
however
that
conviction
as
to
one
if
they're
tried
separately
is
a
bar
to
a
prosecution
of
the
other
and
if
there
tried
concurrently
that
a
defendant
may
be
sentenced
only
as
to
one.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
but
the
jury
--
the
sentence
then
imposed
on
the
defendant
can
be
only
as
to
one.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
the
--
that's
correct.
the
sentencing
power
under
the
indeterminate
sentence
provision
in
indiana
is
a
court
not
a
jury
function.
mr.
john
p.
price
21,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
reckless
homicide.
mr.
john
p.
price
1
to
5,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
except
he
may
not
of
course
sentence
as
to
both
and
as
i
say
the
statute
itself
recognizes
the
collateral
estoppel
when
res
judicata
features
here
by
providing
the
bar.
none
--
in
this
case,
this
petitioner
was
then
charged
as
this
statute
to
which
you
refer
permits
in
two
counts
with
both
of
these
offenses.
remembering
of
course
that
there
qualitatively
identical
so
in
effect
he
was
charged
twice
with
the
same
offense
in
the
sense
that
no
element
is
in
one
that's
not
in
the
other.
he
then
appealed
his
conviction
which
resulted
only
on
the
reckless
homicide
count
to
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
reversed.
mr.
john
p.
price
and
--
mr.
john
p.
price
well
sir,
the
trial
court
had
failed
to
give
certain
instructions
and
the
indiana
supreme
court
held
that
the
trial
court
improperly
refused
instructions
tendered
by
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
no
sir.
we
sit
back
down
and
petitioner
again
retried
not
only
for
reckless
homicide
but
also
for
involuntary
manslaughter
for
which
he
had
been
legally
acquitted.
petitioner
raised
the
question
of
his
protection
from
double
jeopardy
both
under
the
indiana
and
federal
constitutions
at
the
trial
level
and
the
trial
court
held
against
his
contention
based
apparently
on
its
reading
of
the
palko
decision.
mr.
john
p.
price
double
jeopardy.
mr.
john
p.
price
it
does
sir.
but
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
indiana
constitutional
double
jeopardy
provision
substantially
different
in
the
federal
courts
that
had
interpreted
this
one
and
this
case
is
a
classic
example.
i
think
the
indiana
supreme
court
recognizes
clearly
that
the
green
decision
interpreting
double
jeopardy
in
the
federal
constitution
is
not
the
law
in
the
state
of
indiana.
the
appeal
to
the
indiana
supreme
court
then
resulted
in
an
affirmance
surely.
mr.
john
p.
price
well,
insofar
as
the
--
if
you're
speaking
of
the
same
evidence
type
--
mr.
john
p.
price
--
mr.
justice
and
i
think
it
is
to
that
degree
somewhat
attend
to
the
federal
test.
but
if
you
are
talking
about
vertical
or
horizontal
offenses
where
there
has
been
an
acquittal
or
an
implied
acquittal
such
as
existed
in
the
green
decision
then
the
interpretations
are
totally
different,
the
antifascist
of
each
other.
the
indiana
statutes
have
another
provision
to
the
effect
that
when
a
petitioner
or
when
an
appellant
appeals
in
indiana
and
secures
a
new
trial.
this
is
what
he
gets
and
by
that
they
mean
a
new
trial
as
to
every
thing
including
charges
for
which
he's
been
acquitted.
now,
i
submit
this
is
diametrically
opposed
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
federal
level
in
green,
in
the
green
decision.
i
point
out
the
affirmance
of
the
trail
court's
decision
in
--
by
the
indiana
supreme
court
partly
to
call
your
attention
to
a
phrase
which
i
think
typifies
the
character
and
nature
that
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
given
to
double
jeopardy
when
it
stated
in
its
opinion
that
this
right,
the
protection
from
double
jeopardy
is
not
a
hallmark
under
either
the
federal
or
state
systems
of
jurisprudence.
i
think
it's
clear
from
this
opinion
that
the
indiana
supreme
court
regards
double
jeopardy
as
something
totally
within
its
power
to
obliterate
or
control.
i
submit
that
the
state
in
its
brief
in
this
case
has
not
really
objected
at
any
point
to
the
question
but
what
--
there
was
double
jeopardy.
its
argument
has
proceeded
entirely
on
the
question
of
there
was
a
waiver
or
perhaps
no
prejudice
exist
here
or
some
other
aspect
to
it.
but
we
are
in
complete
accord
as
far
as
i
understand
their
position
to
be
that
double
jeopardy
actually
existed.
this
man
was
retried
again
from
the
count
of
involuntary
manslaughter
for
what
she
had
already
once
been
legally
acquitted.
and
when
it
is
remembered
that
involuntary
manslaughter
and
reckless
homicide
are
identical
qualitatively
in
essence
this
man
stood
trial
twice
on
four
different
counts
for
the
identical
offense.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
we
have
a
--
mr.
john
p.
price
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
joinder
initially
is
permitted
by
the
indiana
statute.
now
i
submit
there
is
some
questionableness
about
that
statute
permitting
a
joinder
up
to
qualitatively
identical
offenses.
but
we're
not
raising
that
question
here.
we're
raising
the
fact
that
he
was
actually
tried
twice
on
involuntary
manslaughter
after
he
had
first
been
acquitted
of
that
offense.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
second
trial
the
jury
reached
the
same
result
your
honor.
he
--
they
convicted
him
again
of
reckless
homicide
and
again
returned
no
verdict
on
the
charge
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
and
this
is
what
i
guess
blossoms
into
the
states
argument
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
mr.
john
p.
price
well
sir,
the
offense
of
reckless
homicide
has
no
element
in
it.
that
is
not
also
an
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir.
the
elements
are
identical.
there
is
not
--
not
one
element
in
one
that
is
not
in
the
other.
mr.
john
p.
price
well,
the
involuntary
manslaughter
statute
is
a
much
older
statute
which
is
enacted
really
from
the
common
law.
it's
a
common
law
originated
type
of
statute
and
covers
the
traditional
involuntary
manslaughter
offenses.
reckless
homicide
is
a
specific
automobile
offense
geared
to
securing
prosecutions
and
convections
for
automobile
deaths.
but
--
and
they
do
have
separate
penalties,
this
is
true.
the
involuntary
manslaughter
situation
would
cover
cases
that
the
reckless
homicide
would
not
factually.
mr.
john
p.
price
involuntary
manslaughter
is
2
to
21
and
the
reckless
homicide
is
a
1
to
5
both
indeterminate
sentences.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
no.
but
insofar
as
this
factual
situation
is
concern
the
issues
are
identical.
there
is
nothing
in
involuntary
manslaughter
that's
not
in
reckless
homicide
here
or
in
any
automobile
death
case.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
do
sir.
in
fact
--
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
is
--
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
that
--
i
do
get
this
in
the
indiana
cases,
they
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
this
point
has
actually
been
conceded
quite
clearly
by
the
state's
argument.
they
take
the
position
to
that
the
indiana
court
is
clear
on
this
point.
these
offenses
are
identical
insofar
as
they
apply
to
motor
vehicle
deaths.
i
think
the
cases
in
indiana
are
unanimous.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
harlan
i
think
that
is
correct,
the
indiana
supreme
court
had
extreme
difficulty
not
only
with
green
but
with
the
statute
that
provides
the
bar,
the
double
jeopardy
features
in
the
statute
and
the
fact
that
he
had
actually
been
acquitted
of
one.
but
there's
nothing
in
this
opinion
that
repudiates
that
position
at
all
and
the
cases
prior
to
this
are
uniform
on
that
point.
mr.
john
p.
price
it's
my
understanding
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
if
i
might
answer
this
way
he
was
also
acquitted
of
involuntary
manslaughter
which
includes
every
element
of
reckless
homicide
and
i
could
say
with
just
as
much
for
us
that
he
was
legally
acquitted
of
reckless
homicide.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
law
i
think
is
clear
on
this
in
indiana.
mr.
john
p.
price
well
i
think
the
point
you're
raising
sir
is
that
the
verdicts
are
factually
inconsistent
and
with
this
i
would
totally
--
mr.
john
p.
price
well,
i
would
agree
if
i
understand
your
question
sir
that
the
verdict,
the
reckless
homicide
including
as
it
does
every
element
of
involuntary
manslaughter
is
factually
opposed
diametrically
and
the
verdicts
are
inconsistent.
we
raised
this
question
initially
--
mr.
john
p.
price
the
verdict
where
the
jury
failed
to
acquit
or
convict
on
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
this
is
true.
there
is
a
finding
of
guilty
on
the
reckless
homicide
charge
which
includes
every
element
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
but
i
cannot
escape
from
the
fact
and
maybe
it
is
repetitive
that
he
was
tried.
i
think
really
in
terms
of
double
jeopardy
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
was
convicted
or
acquitted.
he
was
in
jeopardy
on
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
but
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
i
think
it
makes
substantial
difference
mr.
justice
brennan.
first,
in
a
forced
prosecution
leverage
in
the
sense
of
two
counts
for
the
same
thing,
i
think
there's
something
inherently
unfair
in
permitting
the
state
to
enact
over
and
over
and
over
again
ad
infinitum
in
different
--
with
different
names
the
same
statutory
offense.
then
i
think
to
subject
him
to
trial
twice
after
the
jury
has
at
least
failed
to
convict
him
certainly
the
presumptions
are
in
favor
of
a
criminal
defendant
here
i
think.
i
think
all
the
laws
to
that
effect.
then
you
necessarily
must
interpret
the
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
the
state
in
order
to
reach
this
type
of
conclusion
and
the
third
reason
is
that
in
indiana
under
burns
indiana
statutes
91820.
all
felonies
with
indeterminate
sentences
--
all
felonies
with
indeterminate
sentences
have
a
court
function
to
determine
the
sentence.
the
court
actually
determines
the
sentence
in
indiana.
this
is
the
import
of
that
section,
91820.
any
where
there
is
a
felony
with
an
indeterminate
sentence
it
is
a
judicial
function
to
determine
the
sentence
within
those
indeterminate
propositions.
now,
if
you
are
to
accept
the
state's
position
here
that
the
jury
could
really
pick
out
which
one
of
this
they
were
going
to
convict
on,
you
would
be
running
directive
--
directly
contra
to
the
very
section
in
indiana
which
says
this
is
a
court
function.
the
court
determines
this
sentence
not
the
jury
by
picking
out
one
or
the
other
of
exactly
the
same
offenses.
mr.
john
p.
price
they
certainly
do,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
they
did
not
punish
him
for
the
--
mr.
john
p.
price
2
to
21,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes.
under
the
verdict
of
this
court
of
the
indiana
trial
court,
--
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
but
--
mr.
john
p.
price
yes.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
jury
has
--
in
this
case
was
instructed
on
what
involuntary
manslaughter
was
and
the
definition
and
i
don't
recall
that
the
instruction
included
the
penalty
at
all.
mr.
john
p.
price
probably
not
and
i
don't
know
that
if
you
follow
burns
91820
that
it
would
be
actually
a
jury
function
anyway
because
--
mr.
john
p.
price
the
jury
might
have
come
to
that
conclusion.
actually
there's
some
includable
offenses
under
this
that
the
jury
could
have
convicted
off
to
which
have
different
sentences
of
--
to
this
degree
i
suppose
it
was
before
the
jury
what
particular
offense
and
the
punishment
for
it.
mr.
john
p.
price
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
john
p.
price
dissent
--
the
statute
says
he
may
be
sentence
only
as
to
one.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
white
he
wasn't
--
the
court
--
the
jury
was
instructed
if
preliminary
on
the
penalty.
mr.
john
p.
price
that's
my
understanding
that
i
was
not
in
the
trial.
it's
my
understanding
they
were
instructed
to
what
--
mr.
john
p.
price
preliminary
instructions
are
not
in
here,
the
record
here.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
original
record
from
the
indiana
supreme
court
would
contain
them,
i'm
sure.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
if
we
prevail
sir,
the
palko
decision
i
think
must
fall.
i
think
and
--
mr.
john
p.
price
yes.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
would
--
should
think
that
it
would
be
sent
back
to
the
trial
court
for
a
retrial.
we're
not
asking
that
this
man
go
free.
we're
asking
only
that
he
be
retried
for
the
crime
of
reckless
homicide
only.
since
he's
been
once
acquitted
to
use
this
phrase
again
of
the
crime
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
may
i
just
briefly
comment
on
what
i
think
is
in
most
thorough
discussion
of
this
very
problem
in
united
states
versus
wilkins.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
i
certainly
do.
i
think
the
green
case
mr.
justice
is
not
--
mr.
john
p.
price
--
vertical
offenses.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
but
it
seems
to
me
academically
far
worse
to
try
a
man
on
an
identical
offense
essentially
four
times
than
to
do
what
was
done
in
the
green
case.
mr.
john
p.
price
sir
i
don't
see
how
it
can
help
but
reach
palko
but
not
because
of
the
four
times
that
he
was
tried
for
the
identical
offense
but
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
tried
twice
for
an
offense
for
which
he
had
once
been
legally
acquitted.
now,
it's
true
in
parco
the
facts
arose
differently
and
that
the
state
had
a
right
to
appeal
under
the
connecticut
statute.
now,
to
that
degree
the
facts
are
different
but
there
was
a
retrial
of
the
man
on
the
same
offense
in
palko
and
that's
exactly
what
occurred
here.
he
was
retried
for
this
same
offense
for
which
he'd
been
convicted
or
acquitted.
now,
i
see
no
difference
academically
whether
does
offenses
happen
to
be
stack
up
vertically
like
they
were
in
green
includable
offenses
or
whether
there
set
side
by
side
horizontally
as
they
are
here.
in
fact
academically
it
seems
worst
to
do
it
this
way.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
qualitatively,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
sir
i
suppose
had
it
been
raised
initially
there
might
be
a
question
as
to
whether
once
he's
acquitted
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
convicted
of
reckless
homicide
he
could
be
retried
at
all.had
that
been
raised
at
that
point
that
question
very
well
might
be
pertinent.
it
was
not
and
we
have
taken
the
position
that
--
mr.
john
p.
price
it
would
because
--
mr.
john
p.
price
well
sir,
if
i
may
answer.
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
reason
that
it
would
be
double
jeopardy
here
is
because
insofar
as
count
two
is
concern
he
has
not
been
acquitted
and
is
not
seeking
a
new
trial.
there's
nothing
at
--
mr.
john
p.
price
he
is
not
being
convicted,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
p.
price
you
are
--
i
think
sir,
raising
the
question
that
we
raise
initially
in
the
trail
of
this
case
in
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
that
is
that
once
he
is
acquitted
of
one
and
convicted
of
the
other
he
necessarily
must
be
acquitted
of
both
because
they're
identical
--
mr.
john
p.
price
we
took
that
position
and
the
supreme
court
reversed
the
decision
on
another
ground
and
never
did
decide
the
inconsistency
of
the
verdict.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
don't
think
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
told
us.
i
suppose
this
is
determined
by
indiana
law.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
they
did
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
white
i
think
the
answer
--
mr.
john
p.
price
that's
--
mr.
john
p.
price
that's
right
sir.
that's
right,
if
its
--
if
it's
a
constitutional
issue
then
it
is
double
jeopardy.
if
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
john
p.
price
in
this
case,
that
is
--
mr.
john
p.
price
--
essentially
i
think
what
the
indiana
supreme
--
mr.
john
p.
price
no
i
--
i
think
they
did
not
say
this,
they
said,
"we're
not
going
to
really
decide
whether
there's
an
acquittal
or
conviction
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
charge."
and
actually
mr.
justice
white
the
involuntary
manslaughter
charge
was
not
before
the
supreme
court.
it
--
except
insofar
as
it
applies
to
double
jeopardy
but
there
can't
be
a
conviction.
there
was
appealed
from
--
was
purely
the
conviction
of
reckless
homicide.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
do
want
you
to
say
that
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
point
on
this
--
to
your
second
point.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
green
case,
the
man
was
charged
with
first
degree
murder
and
convicted
of
second
with
no
expressed
finding
as
i
recall
the
facts
on
the
first
degree.
of
course
as
this
is
--
this
is
an
implied
acquittal.
he
was
once
in
jeopardy
on
first
degree
murder.
mr.
john
p.
price
he
would
--
mr.
john
p.
price
no,
no.
sir
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
i'm
saying
that
he
was
once
in
jeopardy
on
that.
whether
he
was
ultimately
convicted
or
acquitted,
i
think
academically,
does
nothing
to
destroy
the
fact
he
was
in
jeopardy.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
think
sir.
had
that
been
raised
we
would
--
been
saying
this.
my
--
our
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
and
maybe
i
didn't
make
it
clear
was,
i
think
there
is
grave
doubts
that
this
could
have
--
could
be
done.
but
we
did
appeal
the
conviction
of
reckless
homicide,
it
was
sent
back
for
retrial.
it
was
appealed
again
at
this
point
i
was
brought
into
this
case
and
that
issue
was
not
presented.
but
i
think
if
--
mr.
john
p.
price
oh,
yes
sir.
it's
presented
in
the
constitutional
sense
of
former
jeopardy,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
there's
no
instruction
that
i
know
of
in
this
case
that
told
the
jury
to
do
this.
in
fact
the
statute
doesn't
require
this
at
all.
the
statute
said
--
mr.
john
p.
price
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
well
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
i
am
certain
that
there
was
not.
certain
as
i
can
be
without
going
through
the
entire
record.
the
jury
was
told
that
there
was
no
provision
here
to
return
a
verdict
on
only
one
of
these
two
counts.
in
fact
if
i
may
answer
this
way
mr.
justice,
i
think
this
would
in
itself
impose
an
improper
provision
because
the
statute
in
indiana
specifically
provides
in
all
indeterminate
sentence
cases
that
it's
a
court
function
to
determine
the
sentence
not
a
jury
function.
and
if
a
court
would
take
it
upon
itself
at
the
trial
level
to
say
to
the
jury,
you
determine
which
one
of
this
you're
going
to
convict
of.
you
have
delegated
that
its
sentence
making
power
form
the
judiciary
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
p.
price
and
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
thank
you
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
may
i
first
comment
on
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
concerning
the
indiana
statutes
and
the
question
of,
if
an
acquittal
occurs
as
to
one
offense
the
effect
upon
a
second
trial
for
the
other
and
i
refer
to
page
15
of
our
brief
where
the
statute
itself
is
quoted
if
i
may
take
from
that
statute
this
sentence,
"with
respect
to
the
offense
of
reckless
homicide
and
involuntary
manslaughter,
a
final
judgment
of
conviction
of
one
shall
be
a
bar
to
the
other."
it
does
not
say
an
acquittal
presumably,
state
of
indiana
especially
if
the
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
statutes
it
could
not
only
enact
statutes
endlessly
for
the
same
offense
but
could
try
then
piecemeal
under
that
section.
the
state's
argument,
if
it
please
the
court
presumes
that
there
is
no
constitutional
encroachment
regardless
of
how
many
times
the
legislature
may
reenact
the
same
qualitative
statute
that
there
is
never
a
point
where
this
has
constitutional
implications
and
i
submit
to
law
is
just
not
that
calloused.
the
state
says
that
cichos
here
may
have
been
put
in
jeopardy
but
he
waived
his
jeopardy.
he
waived
it
by
taken
a
new
trail
on
the
conditions
that
the
state
of
indiana
imposes.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
state
cannot
impose
a
relinquishment
of
a
constitutional
protection
as
the
price
of
an
appeal
whether
an
appeal
be
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
or
not
and
i
cite
two
cases
from
this
court
that
arose
in
indiana,
dowd
versus
cook,
340
u.s.
206
and
lane
versus
brown,
372
u.s.
477.
there
the
appellate
procedure
for
an
indigent
defendant
was
left
solely
to
the
discretion
of
the
public
defender
whether
the
public
defender
wanted
to
order
a
transcript
or
not
and
this
court
struck
that
down
as
discriminatory
and
improper.
the
state
could
not
impose
this
type
of
price
for
the
exercising
the
right
to
appeal..
on
the
question
of
mootness
and
no
prejudice,
i
submit
to
you
that
any
time
may
jury
has
within
it
the
power
to
compromise
on
alternative
counts
for
the
same
offense
compromising
jury
possibilities
of
the
worst
sort
are
present.
i
submit
to
you
that
prosecution
leverage
of
the
worst
sort
is
present
when
a
state
cannot
only
enact
over
and
over
again
the
same
offense
but
can
try
over
and
over
again
for
the
same
offense.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
jury
was
told
the
instruction
which
you
read
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
is
precisely
what
the
jury
was
told,
that
is
correct
sir
and
i
think
the
essence
of
that
is
that
the
jury
did
acquit
the
man
for
involuntary
manslaughter
for
that
very
instruction.
mr.
john
p.
price
supreme
court
said
as
i
read
their
opinion,
we
don't
want
to
reach
this
question
and
we're
not
going
to
really
apply
those
cases
that
say
that
is
an
acquittal.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
this
is
an
acquittal,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
we're
arguing
that
we
should
have
a
new
trial
under
reckless
homicide,
it's
all
we're
asking
here.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
--
mr.
john
p.
price
that
is
correct
sir,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
think
that
may
have
been
on
the
case
at
one
point
but
at
this
point
we
are
only
asking
to
be
tried
on
one
count,
the
count
for
which
this
man
has
been
convicted
and
to
leave
the
prosecution
leverage
and
the
compromising
jury
possibilities
in
this
dual
count
out
of
this
trial.
mr.
john
p.
price
no,
i
say
that
the
--
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
if
that
is
double
jeopardy
i
am
not.
my
contention
is
that
we
raise
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
insofar
as
it
pertains
to
the
retrial
of
the
involuntary
manslaughter
statute.
i
think
there
is
a
very
grave
question
whether
he
can
be
tried
all
over
again
for
reckless
homicide
but
that
was
not
injected
at
the
trail
of
the
case.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
move
the
admission
pro
hac
vice
of
my
adversary
mr.
douglas
mcfadden,
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
indiana.
i
would
so
move
his
admission
if
i
could
sir.
the
issue
presented
by
the
instance
case
pertains
to
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
protection
against
double
jeopardy.
specifically
we
have
asked
this
court
to
revisit
the
decision
of
palko
versus
connecticut.
specifically
this
case
then
concerned
itself
with
whether
the
protection
against
double
jeopardy
is
of
such
statute
so
as
to
be
immune
from
state
encroachment
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
charged
in
two
counts,
the
first
was
the
violation
in
indiana
of
the
crime
of
reckless
homicide
and
then
the
second
count,
the
offense
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
after
a
lengthy
trial
the
petitioner
was
convicted
only
of
the
crime
of
reckless
homicide
and
the
jury
returned
no
verdict
on
the
count
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
although
we
submit
it's
not
really
germane
to
the
academic
question
here,
it
is
well
settled
in
indiana
that
jury
silence
on
account
is
tantamount
to
an
acquittal.
so
i
submit
that
in
every
legal
effect
this
petitioner
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
reckless
homicide
and
acquitted
of
the
crime
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
no.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir
it
is
not.
the
offenses
are
qualitatively
identical.
neither
is
included
in
the
other.
they're
horizontal
as
opposed
to
vertical
offenses.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
with
this
exception
mr.
justice
harlan
insofar
as
it
applies
to
motor
vehicle
deaths.
mr.
john
p.
price
which
this
case
is
concerned
with,
yes.
insofar
as
this
case
in
motor
vehicle
deaths
are
concerned,
these
two
offenses
are
qualitatively
identical.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
reckless
homicide
statute
does
provide
a
lesser
--
mr.
john
p.
price
punishment
or
at
least
the
indeterminate
sentence
starts
earlier,
one
to
five
as
oppose
to
the
2
to
21
under
the
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice,
there
is
another
statute
in
indiana
which
i
think
recognizes
the
very
double
jeopardy
features
that
we're
submitting
to
you
today.
in
that
it
provides
these
two
counts
may
be
joined
in
one
indictment
or
affidavit.
the
trial
then
can
concur
simultaneously
as
to
both.
it
goes
on
to
point
out
however
that
conviction
as
to
one
if
they're
tried
separately
is
a
bar
to
a
prosecution
of
the
other
and
if
there
tried
concurrently
that
a
defendant
may
be
sentenced
only
as
to
one.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
but
the
jury
--
the
sentence
then
imposed
on
the
defendant
can
be
only
as
to
one.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
the
--
that's
correct.
the
sentencing
power
under
the
indeterminate
sentence
provision
in
indiana
is
a
court
not
a
jury
function.
mr.
john
p.
price
21,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
reckless
homicide.
mr.
john
p.
price
1
to
5,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
except
he
may
not
of
course
sentence
as
to
both
and
as
i
say
the
statute
itself
recognizes
the
collateral
estoppel
when
res
judicata
features
here
by
providing
the
bar.
none
--
in
this
case,
this
petitioner
was
then
charged
as
this
statute
to
which
you
refer
permits
in
two
counts
with
both
of
these
offenses.
remembering
of
course
that
there
qualitatively
identical
so
in
effect
he
was
charged
twice
with
the
same
offense
in
the
sense
that
no
element
is
in
one
that's
not
in
the
other.
he
then
appealed
his
conviction
which
resulted
only
on
the
reckless
homicide
count
to
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
reversed.
mr.
john
p.
price
and
--
mr.
john
p.
price
well
sir,
the
trial
court
had
failed
to
give
certain
instructions
and
the
indiana
supreme
court
held
that
the
trial
court
improperly
refused
instructions
tendered
by
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
no
sir.
we
sit
back
down
and
petitioner
again
retried
not
only
for
reckless
homicide
but
also
for
involuntary
manslaughter
for
which
he
had
been
legally
acquitted.
petitioner
raised
the
question
of
his
protection
from
double
jeopardy
both
under
the
indiana
and
federal
constitutions
at
the
trial
level
and
the
trial
court
held
against
his
contention
based
apparently
on
its
reading
of
the
palko
decision.
mr.
john
p.
price
double
jeopardy.
mr.
john
p.
price
it
does
sir.
but
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
indiana
constitutional
double
jeopardy
provision
substantially
different
in
the
federal
courts
that
had
interpreted
this
one
and
this
case
is
a
classic
example.
i
think
the
indiana
supreme
court
recognizes
clearly
that
the
green
decision
interpreting
double
jeopardy
in
the
federal
constitution
is
not
the
law
in
the
state
of
indiana.
the
appeal
to
the
indiana
supreme
court
then
resulted
in
an
affirmance
surely.
mr.
john
p.
price
well,
insofar
as
the
--
if
you're
speaking
of
the
same
evidence
type
--
mr.
john
p.
price
--
mr.
justice
and
i
think
it
is
to
that
degree
somewhat
attend
to
the
federal
test.
but
if
you
are
talking
about
vertical
or
horizontal
offenses
where
there
has
been
an
acquittal
or
an
implied
acquittal
such
as
existed
in
the
green
decision
then
the
interpretations
are
totally
different,
the
antifascist
of
each
other.
the
indiana
statutes
have
another
provision
to
the
effect
that
when
a
petitioner
or
when
an
appellant
appeals
in
indiana
and
secures
a
new
trial.
this
is
what
he
gets
and
by
that
they
mean
a
new
trial
as
to
every
thing
including
charges
for
which
he's
been
acquitted.
now,
i
submit
this
is
diametrically
opposed
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
federal
level
in
green,
in
the
green
decision.
i
point
out
the
affirmance
of
the
trail
court's
decision
in
--
by
the
indiana
supreme
court
partly
to
call
your
attention
to
a
phrase
which
i
think
typifies
the
character
and
nature
that
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
given
to
double
jeopardy
when
it
stated
in
its
opinion
that
this
right,
the
protection
from
double
jeopardy
is
not
a
hallmark
under
either
the
federal
or
state
systems
of
jurisprudence.
i
think
it's
clear
from
this
opinion
that
the
indiana
supreme
court
regards
double
jeopardy
as
something
totally
within
its
power
to
obliterate
or
control.
i
submit
that
the
state
in
its
brief
in
this
case
has
not
really
objected
at
any
point
to
the
question
but
what
--
there
was
double
jeopardy.
its
argument
has
proceeded
entirely
on
the
question
of
there
was
a
waiver
or
perhaps
no
prejudice
exist
here
or
some
other
aspect
to
it.
but
we
are
in
complete
accord
as
far
as
i
understand
their
position
to
be
that
double
jeopardy
actually
existed.
this
man
was
retried
again
from
the
count
of
involuntary
manslaughter
for
what
she
had
already
once
been
legally
acquitted.
and
when
it
is
remembered
that
involuntary
manslaughter
and
reckless
homicide
are
identical
qualitatively
in
essence
this
man
stood
trial
twice
on
four
different
counts
for
the
identical
offense.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
we
have
a
--
mr.
john
p.
price
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
joinder
initially
is
permitted
by
the
indiana
statute.
now
i
submit
there
is
some
questionableness
about
that
statute
permitting
a
joinder
up
to
qualitatively
identical
offenses.
but
we're
not
raising
that
question
here.
we're
raising
the
fact
that
he
was
actually
tried
twice
on
involuntary
manslaughter
after
he
had
first
been
acquitted
of
that
offense.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
second
trial
the
jury
reached
the
same
result
your
honor.
he
--
they
convicted
him
again
of
reckless
homicide
and
again
returned
no
verdict
on
the
charge
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
and
this
is
what
i
guess
blossoms
into
the
states
argument
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
mr.
john
p.
price
well
sir,
the
offense
of
reckless
homicide
has
no
element
in
it.
that
is
not
also
an
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir.
the
elements
are
identical.
there
is
not
--
not
one
element
in
one
that
is
not
in
the
other.
mr.
john
p.
price
well,
the
involuntary
manslaughter
statute
is
a
much
older
statute
which
is
enacted
really
from
the
common
law.
it's
a
common
law
originated
type
of
statute
and
covers
the
traditional
involuntary
manslaughter
offenses.
reckless
homicide
is
a
specific
automobile
offense
geared
to
securing
prosecutions
and
convections
for
automobile
deaths.
but
--
and
they
do
have
separate
penalties,
this
is
true.
the
involuntary
manslaughter
situation
would
cover
cases
that
the
reckless
homicide
would
not
factually.
mr.
john
p.
price
involuntary
manslaughter
is
2
to
21
and
the
reckless
homicide
is
a
1
to
5
both
indeterminate
sentences.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
no.
but
insofar
as
this
factual
situation
is
concern
the
issues
are
identical.
there
is
nothing
in
involuntary
manslaughter
that's
not
in
reckless
homicide
here
or
in
any
automobile
death
case.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
do
sir.
in
fact
--
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
is
--
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
that
--
i
do
get
this
in
the
indiana
cases,
they
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
this
point
has
actually
been
conceded
quite
clearly
by
the
state's
argument.
they
take
the
position
to
that
the
indiana
court
is
clear
on
this
point.
these
offenses
are
identical
insofar
as
they
apply
to
motor
vehicle
deaths.
i
think
the
cases
in
indiana
are
unanimous.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
harlan
i
think
that
is
correct,
the
indiana
supreme
court
had
extreme
difficulty
not
only
with
green
but
with
the
statute
that
provides
the
bar,
the
double
jeopardy
features
in
the
statute
and
the
fact
that
he
had
actually
been
acquitted
of
one.
but
there's
nothing
in
this
opinion
that
repudiates
that
position
at
all
and
the
cases
prior
to
this
are
uniform
on
that
point.
mr.
john
p.
price
it's
my
understanding
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
if
i
might
answer
this
way
he
was
also
acquitted
of
involuntary
manslaughter
which
includes
every
element
of
reckless
homicide
and
i
could
say
with
just
as
much
for
us
that
he
was
legally
acquitted
of
reckless
homicide.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
law
i
think
is
clear
on
this
in
indiana.
mr.
john
p.
price
well
i
think
the
point
you're
raising
sir
is
that
the
verdicts
are
factually
inconsistent
and
with
this
i
would
totally
--
mr.
john
p.
price
well,
i
would
agree
if
i
understand
your
question
sir
that
the
verdict,
the
reckless
homicide
including
as
it
does
every
element
of
involuntary
manslaughter
is
factually
opposed
diametrically
and
the
verdicts
are
inconsistent.
we
raised
this
question
initially
--
mr.
john
p.
price
the
verdict
where
the
jury
failed
to
acquit
or
convict
on
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
this
is
true.
there
is
a
finding
of
guilty
on
the
reckless
homicide
charge
which
includes
every
element
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
but
i
cannot
escape
from
the
fact
and
maybe
it
is
repetitive
that
he
was
tried.
i
think
really
in
terms
of
double
jeopardy
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
was
convicted
or
acquitted.
he
was
in
jeopardy
on
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
but
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
i
think
it
makes
substantial
difference
mr.
justice
brennan.
first,
in
a
forced
prosecution
leverage
in
the
sense
of
two
counts
for
the
same
thing,
i
think
there's
something
inherently
unfair
in
permitting
the
state
to
enact
over
and
over
and
over
again
ad
infinitum
in
different
--
with
different
names
the
same
statutory
offense.
then
i
think
to
subject
him
to
trial
twice
after
the
jury
has
at
least
failed
to
convict
him
certainly
the
presumptions
are
in
favor
of
a
criminal
defendant
here
i
think.
i
think
all
the
laws
to
that
effect.
then
you
necessarily
must
interpret
the
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
the
state
in
order
to
reach
this
type
of
conclusion
and
the
third
reason
is
that
in
indiana
under
burns
indiana
statutes
91820.
all
felonies
with
indeterminate
sentences
--
all
felonies
with
indeterminate
sentences
have
a
court
function
to
determine
the
sentence.
the
court
actually
determines
the
sentence
in
indiana.
this
is
the
import
of
that
section,
91820.
any
where
there
is
a
felony
with
an
indeterminate
sentence
it
is
a
judicial
function
to
determine
the
sentence
within
those
indeterminate
propositions.
now,
if
you
are
to
accept
the
state's
position
here
that
the
jury
could
really
pick
out
which
one
of
this
they
were
going
to
convict
on,
you
would
be
running
directive
--
directly
contra
to
the
very
section
in
indiana
which
says
this
is
a
court
function.
the
court
determines
this
sentence
not
the
jury
by
picking
out
one
or
the
other
of
exactly
the
same
offenses.
mr.
john
p.
price
they
certainly
do,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
they
did
not
punish
him
for
the
--
mr.
john
p.
price
2
to
21,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes.
under
the
verdict
of
this
court
of
the
indiana
trial
court,
--
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
but
--
mr.
john
p.
price
yes.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
jury
has
--
in
this
case
was
instructed
on
what
involuntary
manslaughter
was
and
the
definition
and
i
don't
recall
that
the
instruction
included
the
penalty
at
all.
mr.
john
p.
price
probably
not
and
i
don't
know
that
if
you
follow
burns
91820
that
it
would
be
actually
a
jury
function
anyway
because
--
mr.
john
p.
price
the
jury
might
have
come
to
that
conclusion.
actually
there's
some
includable
offenses
under
this
that
the
jury
could
have
convicted
off
to
which
have
different
sentences
of
--
to
this
degree
i
suppose
it
was
before
the
jury
what
particular
offense
and
the
punishment
for
it.
mr.
john
p.
price
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
john
p.
price
dissent
--
the
statute
says
he
may
be
sentence
only
as
to
one.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
white
he
wasn't
--
the
court
--
the
jury
was
instructed
if
preliminary
on
the
penalty.
mr.
john
p.
price
that's
my
understanding
that
i
was
not
in
the
trial.
it's
my
understanding
they
were
instructed
to
what
--
mr.
john
p.
price
preliminary
instructions
are
not
in
here,
the
record
here.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
original
record
from
the
indiana
supreme
court
would
contain
them,
i'm
sure.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
if
we
prevail
sir,
the
palko
decision
i
think
must
fall.
i
think
and
--
mr.
john
p.
price
yes.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
would
--
should
think
that
it
would
be
sent
back
to
the
trial
court
for
a
retrial.
we're
not
asking
that
this
man
go
free.
we're
asking
only
that
he
be
retried
for
the
crime
of
reckless
homicide
only.
since
he's
been
once
acquitted
to
use
this
phrase
again
of
the
crime
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
may
i
just
briefly
comment
on
what
i
think
is
in
most
thorough
discussion
of
this
very
problem
in
united
states
versus
wilkins.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
i
certainly
do.
i
think
the
green
case
mr.
justice
is
not
--
mr.
john
p.
price
--
vertical
offenses.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
but
it
seems
to
me
academically
far
worse
to
try
a
man
on
an
identical
offense
essentially
four
times
than
to
do
what
was
done
in
the
green
case.
mr.
john
p.
price
sir
i
don't
see
how
it
can
help
but
reach
palko
but
not
because
of
the
four
times
that
he
was
tried
for
the
identical
offense
but
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
tried
twice
for
an
offense
for
which
he
had
once
been
legally
acquitted.
now,
it's
true
in
parco
the
facts
arose
differently
and
that
the
state
had
a
right
to
appeal
under
the
connecticut
statute.
now,
to
that
degree
the
facts
are
different
but
there
was
a
retrial
of
the
man
on
the
same
offense
in
palko
and
that's
exactly
what
occurred
here.
he
was
retried
for
this
same
offense
for
which
he'd
been
convicted
or
acquitted.
now,
i
see
no
difference
academically
whether
does
offenses
happen
to
be
stack
up
vertically
like
they
were
in
green
includable
offenses
or
whether
there
set
side
by
side
horizontally
as
they
are
here.
in
fact
academically
it
seems
worst
to
do
it
this
way.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
qualitatively,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
sir
i
suppose
had
it
been
raised
initially
there
might
be
a
question
as
to
whether
once
he's
acquitted
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
convicted
of
reckless
homicide
he
could
be
retried
at
all.had
that
been
raised
at
that
point
that
question
very
well
might
be
pertinent.
it
was
not
and
we
have
taken
the
position
that
--
mr.
john
p.
price
it
would
because
--
mr.
john
p.
price
well
sir,
if
i
may
answer.
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
reason
that
it
would
be
double
jeopardy
here
is
because
insofar
as
count
two
is
concern
he
has
not
been
acquitted
and
is
not
seeking
a
new
trial.
there's
nothing
at
--
mr.
john
p.
price
he
is
not
being
convicted,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
p.
price
you
are
--
i
think
sir,
raising
the
question
that
we
raise
initially
in
the
trail
of
this
case
in
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
that
is
that
once
he
is
acquitted
of
one
and
convicted
of
the
other
he
necessarily
must
be
acquitted
of
both
because
they're
identical
--
mr.
john
p.
price
we
took
that
position
and
the
supreme
court
reversed
the
decision
on
another
ground
and
never
did
decide
the
inconsistency
of
the
verdict.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
don't
think
the
indiana
supreme
court
has
told
us.
i
suppose
this
is
determined
by
indiana
law.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
they
did
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
white
i
think
the
answer
--
mr.
john
p.
price
that's
--
mr.
john
p.
price
that's
right
sir.
that's
right,
if
its
--
if
it's
a
constitutional
issue
then
it
is
double
jeopardy.
if
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
john
p.
price
in
this
case,
that
is
--
mr.
john
p.
price
--
essentially
i
think
what
the
indiana
supreme
--
mr.
john
p.
price
no
i
--
i
think
they
did
not
say
this,
they
said,
"we're
not
going
to
really
decide
whether
there's
an
acquittal
or
conviction
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
charge."
and
actually
mr.
justice
white
the
involuntary
manslaughter
charge
was
not
before
the
supreme
court.
it
--
except
insofar
as
it
applies
to
double
jeopardy
but
there
can't
be
a
conviction.
there
was
appealed
from
--
was
purely
the
conviction
of
reckless
homicide.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
do
want
you
to
say
that
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
justice
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
point
on
this
--
to
your
second
point.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
green
case,
the
man
was
charged
with
first
degree
murder
and
convicted
of
second
with
no
expressed
finding
as
i
recall
the
facts
on
the
first
degree.
of
course
as
this
is
--
this
is
an
implied
acquittal.
he
was
once
in
jeopardy
on
first
degree
murder.
mr.
john
p.
price
he
would
--
mr.
john
p.
price
no,
no.
sir
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
i'm
saying
that
he
was
once
in
jeopardy
on
that.
whether
he
was
ultimately
convicted
or
acquitted,
i
think
academically,
does
nothing
to
destroy
the
fact
he
was
in
jeopardy.
mr.
john
p.
price
i
think
sir.
had
that
been
raised
we
would
--
been
saying
this.
my
--
our
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
and
maybe
i
didn't
make
it
clear
was,
i
think
there
is
grave
doubts
that
this
could
have
--
could
be
done.
but
we
did
appeal
the
conviction
of
reckless
homicide,
it
was
sent
back
for
retrial.
it
was
appealed
again
at
this
point
i
was
brought
into
this
case
and
that
issue
was
not
presented.
but
i
think
if
--
mr.
john
p.
price
oh,
yes
sir.
it's
presented
in
the
constitutional
sense
of
former
jeopardy,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
there's
no
instruction
that
i
know
of
in
this
case
that
told
the
jury
to
do
this.
in
fact
the
statute
doesn't
require
this
at
all.
the
statute
said
--
mr.
john
p.
price
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
well
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
i
am
certain
that
there
was
not.
certain
as
i
can
be
without
going
through
the
entire
record.
the
jury
was
told
that
there
was
no
provision
here
to
return
a
verdict
on
only
one
of
these
two
counts.
in
fact
if
i
may
answer
this
way
mr.
justice,
i
think
this
would
in
itself
impose
an
improper
provision
because
the
statute
in
indiana
specifically
provides
in
all
indeterminate
sentence
cases
that
it's
a
court
function
to
determine
the
sentence
not
a
jury
function.
and
if
a
court
would
take
it
upon
itself
at
the
trial
level
to
say
to
the
jury,
you
determine
which
one
of
this
you're
going
to
convict
of.
you
have
delegated
that
its
sentence
making
power
form
the
judiciary
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
p.
price
and
i
--
mr.
john
p.
price
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
thank
you
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
may
i
first
comment
on
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
concerning
the
indiana
statutes
and
the
question
of,
if
an
acquittal
occurs
as
to
one
offense
the
effect
upon
a
second
trial
for
the
other
and
i
refer
to
page
15
of
our
brief
where
the
statute
itself
is
quoted
if
i
may
take
from
that
statute
this
sentence,
"with
respect
to
the
offense
of
reckless
homicide
and
involuntary
manslaughter,
a
final
judgment
of
conviction
of
one
shall
be
a
bar
to
the
other."
it
does
not
say
an
acquittal
presumably,
state
of
indiana
especially
if
the
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
statutes
it
could
not
only
enact
statutes
endlessly
for
the
same
offense
but
could
try
then
piecemeal
under
that
section.
the
state's
argument,
if
it
please
the
court
presumes
that
there
is
no
constitutional
encroachment
regardless
of
how
many
times
the
legislature
may
reenact
the
same
qualitative
statute
that
there
is
never
a
point
where
this
has
constitutional
implications
and
i
submit
to
law
is
just
not
that
calloused.
the
state
says
that
cichos
here
may
have
been
put
in
jeopardy
but
he
waived
his
jeopardy.
he
waived
it
by
taken
a
new
trail
on
the
conditions
that
the
state
of
indiana
imposes.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
state
cannot
impose
a
relinquishment
of
a
constitutional
protection
as
the
price
of
an
appeal
whether
an
appeal
be
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
or
not
and
i
cite
two
cases
from
this
court
that
arose
in
indiana,
dowd
versus
cook,
340
u.s.
206
and
lane
versus
brown,
372
u.s.
477.
there
the
appellate
procedure
for
an
indigent
defendant
was
left
solely
to
the
discretion
of
the
public
defender
whether
the
public
defender
wanted
to
order
a
transcript
or
not
and
this
court
struck
that
down
as
discriminatory
and
improper.
the
state
could
not
impose
this
type
of
price
for
the
exercising
the
right
to
appeal..
on
the
question
of
mootness
and
no
prejudice,
i
submit
to
you
that
any
time
may
jury
has
within
it
the
power
to
compromise
on
alternative
counts
for
the
same
offense
compromising
jury
possibilities
of
the
worst
sort
are
present.
i
submit
to
you
that
prosecution
leverage
of
the
worst
sort
is
present
when
a
state
cannot
only
enact
over
and
over
again
the
same
offense
but
can
try
over
and
over
again
for
the
same
offense.
mr.
john
p.
price
the
jury
was
told
the
instruction
which
you
read
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
is
precisely
what
the
jury
was
told,
that
is
correct
sir
and
i
think
the
essence
of
that
is
that
the
jury
did
acquit
the
man
for
involuntary
manslaughter
for
that
very
instruction.
mr.
john
p.
price
supreme
court
said
as
i
read
their
opinion,
we
don't
want
to
reach
this
question
and
we're
not
going
to
really
apply
those
cases
that
say
that
is
an
acquittal.
mr.
john
p.
price
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
this
is
an
acquittal,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
we're
arguing
that
we
should
have
a
new
trial
under
reckless
homicide,
it's
all
we're
asking
here.
mr.
john
p.
price
that
--
mr.
john
p.
price
that
is
correct
sir,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
think
that
may
have
been
on
the
case
at
one
point
but
at
this
point
we
are
only
asking
to
be
tried
on
one
count,
the
count
for
which
this
man
has
been
convicted
and
to
leave
the
prosecution
leverage
and
the
compromising
jury
possibilities
in
this
dual
count
out
of
this
trial.
mr.
john
p.
price
no,
i
say
that
the
--
mr.
john
p.
price
no
sir,
if
that
is
double
jeopardy
i
am
not.
my
contention
is
that
we
raise
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
insofar
as
it
pertains
to
the
retrial
of
the
involuntary
manslaughter
statute.
i
think
there
is
a
very
grave
question
whether
he
can
be
tried
all
over
again
for
reckless
homicide
but
that
was
not
injected
at
the
trail
of
the
case.
thank
you
sir.
