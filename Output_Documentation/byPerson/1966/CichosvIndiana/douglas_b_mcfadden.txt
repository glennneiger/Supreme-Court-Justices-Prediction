mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
major
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
incorporated
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
and
therefore
directly
applicable
to
the
states
because
even
assuming
arguendo
that
it
is.
ronald
cichos
was
not
twice
put
in
jeopardy.
let
me
just
briefly
go
back
to
the
facts.
ronald
cichos
went
to
trial
on
a
two
count,
amended
affidavit
charging
him
with
reckless
homicide
and
involuntary
manslaughter.
the
jury
came
in
with
a
verdict,
finding
him
guilty
of
reckless
homicide.
from
that
verdict
he
filed
a
motion
for
new
trial.
the
trial
court
overruled
his
motion
and
from
the
ruling
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
he
appealed,
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
assigning
as
his
only
heir
the
trial
court's
ruling
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
supreme
court
of
indiana
granted
him
the
exact
relief
that
he
prayed
for.
they
grant
him
of
a
new
trial
which
in
indiana
under
indiana's
appellate
procedure
means
a
complete
new
trial.
and
this
is
what
he
received
on
the
second
trial
and
also
he
received
an
identical
verdict.the
jury
again
came
in
finding
him
guilty
of
reckless
homicide.
it
is
our
position
that
the
petitioner's
reliance
upon
green
versus
united
states
is
completely
unfounded.
green
versus
united
states
is
wholly
inapplicable
to
the
case
at
bar
on
--
for
several
reasons,
one
of
which
is
the
waiver
question.
now
this
court
rejected
the
government's
contentions
on
waiver
on
the
double
jeopardy
on
--
after
a
--
the
granting
of
a
new
trial
in
green
versus
united
states.
but
that
however
does
not
dispose
of
the
question
on
waiver
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
in
this
case
you're
dealing
with
state
appellate
procedure
and
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
state
to
provide
a
system
of
appellate
review.
does
not
provide
a
system
of
appellate
--
require
a
system
of
appellate
procedure.
this
court
in
mckane
verus
durston
said
that
a
state
may
accord
an
appeal
upon
whatever
terms
it
deems
proper
which
was
cited
with
approval
in
griffin
v.
illinois.
so
it
is
our
position
first
of
all
that
ronald
cichos
waived
the
double
jeopardy
question
when
he
sought
a
new
trial
in
the
indiana
supreme
court.
the
only
limitation
that
this
court
is
put
upon
mckane
v.
durston
was
that
in
griffin
v.
illinois
when
it
said,
"the
state's
appellate
court
system
cannot
be
discriminatory
under
the
equal
protection
clause."
it's
not
to
say
that
a
state
must
provide
a
system
of
appellate
review
but
only
that
it
cannot
be
discriminatory.
so,
the
waiver
question
cannot
be
decided
by
this
court
in
the
same
way
that
was
decided
in
green
because
you
are
dealing
with
two
different
systems
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
appeal.
it
must
hold
ronald
cichos
has
waived
the
double
jeopardy
question
but
even
if
we
assume
arguendo
that
he
has
not
waived
the
double
jeopardy
question,
ronald
cichos
was
never
twice
put
in
jeopardy
in
this
case.
because
it's
been
pointed
out
indiana
law
and
we
will
agree
with
mr.
price,
reckless
homicide
and
involuntary
manslaughter
where
an
automobile
is
involved
or
identical
offenses
requiring
identical
proof
only
the
punishment
differs.
reckless
homicide
carries
a
punishment
of
1
to
5
as
in
this
case,
involuntary
manslaughter
2
to
21.
it
is
for
this
reason
--
it
is
our
position
that
stroud
versus
united
states
is
controlling
in
the
case
at
bar
and
not
green
versus
united
states
because
here
you
cannot
say
that
the
jury
silence
is
tantamount
to
acquittal.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
it
is
not
in
the
record
to
my
knowledge
and
i
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
am
--
i'm
quite
convinced
that
it
would
be
on
the
original
record.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
do.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
do
not
know
as
a
fact.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
the
jury
however,
it
would
appear
from
the
supreme
court's
opinion
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out
was
aware
of
this
and
therefore
the
jury's
silence
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
count
must
be
taken
as
a
manifestation
of
mercy
and
certainly
not
acquittal
because
the
fact
that
you
have
the
identical
fact
patterns
and
proof
required.
now,
this
is
what
distinguishes
this
case
in
green
versus
united
states
is
the
failure
of
proof
question.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
proof
required
for
felony
murder,
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter.
well
in
green,
you
had
a
man
who
was
convicted,
charged
and
convicted
of
felony
murder.
after
this
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
after
which
they
went
back
for
a
new
trail
and
he
was
found
guilty
of
felony
murder.
now,
--
well
the
distinctions
are
subtle,
there
is
a
difference
on
the
proof
required
between
felony
murder
and
second
degree
murder.
felony
murder
requires
proof
of
a
killing
and
the
perpetration
of
one
of
the
common
law
felonies.
in
this
instance
it
was
arson.
second
degree
murder
is
a
finding
of
a
killing
with
malice
in
the
absence
of
premeditation.
so
it's
possible
for
the
prosecution
to
have
failed
in
its
proof
in
that
first
trial
in
green
and
then
come
back
for
another
chance
at
it
in
the
second
trial.
it
might
contrast
in
stroud
versus
united
states
you
had
a
man
who
went
to
trial
three
times
for
first
degree
murder.
the
first
time
he
received
the
death
sentence.
after
a
successful
appeal,
he
received
a
sentence
--
i
think
it
was
life.
after
again
a
successful
appeal
he
received
the
death
sentence
and
this
court
affirmed
the
decision
below
saying
that
the
jury's
decision
in
that
second
case
was
not
a
failure
of
proof,
it's
not
sufficient
to
put
him
on
double
jeopardy
but
was
nothing
more
than
a
manifestation
of
mercy
on
the
part
of
the
jury
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
don't
think
it
would
violate
the
constitution
your
honor
unless
you
have
--
you
would
have
a
situation
such
as
happened
in
green
even
though
they
are
the
same
punishment.
the
fact
that
you
might
have
will
say
all
three
are
charged
and
they
might
fail
to
come
in.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well,
it
would
depend
again.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
it
would
depend
upon
the
facts
requiring
proof.
if
the
same
facts
are
required
for
all
three
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
alright,
then
you
don't
have
double
jeopardy
because
you
have
to
have
--
in
order
to
have
double
jeopardy
you've
got
to
have
the
distinctions
and
proof.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
to
have
the
acquittal.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
oh,
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
the
course
question,
yes
i
do
agree
that
would
--
double
jeopardy
in
that
sense.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
here
you
have
actually
two
different
offenses
but
on
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
he'll
only
be
punished
once.
but
if
the
jury
comes
in
and
finds
him
not
guilty
of
one
and
silent
on
the
other
he
stands
a
free
man.
but
if
the
jury
comes
in
and
finds
him
guilty
on
one
and
a
silent
on
the
other,
he
must
pay
his
debt
to
society
and
go
to
jail.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
oh,
yes.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
the
law
is
not
clear
your
honor
but
i
think
in
light
of
the
indiana
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
i
don't
think
you
could.
it
would
stand
as
bar
for
the
prosecution.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no,
i
--
it's
not
this
case
your
honor.
i
can't
cite
exactly,
it's
the
roger's
case,
and
i
believe
the
backman
(ph)
case
with
both
i
believe
to
this
conclusion.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
they
were
double
jeopardy
cases.
i
don't
recall
the
fact
pattern
in
those
cases
your
honor
because
they
were
not
specifically
involved
here.
but
from
those
cases
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
by
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no
sir,
by
affidavit
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
by
affidavit
which
is
--
it's
indiana's
practice.
it's
almost
identical
to
practice
by
information
the
federal
system.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
because
i
--
of
course
i'm
speculating,
i'm
looking
into
the
prosecutor's
mind.
prosecutor
would
feel
that
here
you
have
a
violation
possibly
both
--
of
both
statutes.
of
course
you
do
since
they
require
identical
proof.
so
you
prosecute
on
both
of
them
and
leave
it
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
they
want
to
send
him
away
for
2
to
21
or
send
him
away
for
1
to
5.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
will
not
foreclose
the
possibility
your
honor
but
it
is
not
in
this
case.
it's
not
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
would
be
inclined
to
agree
with
your
honor
at
first
reading
the
statute.
however
i
do
not
interpret
the
law
in
indiana
but
that
is
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
they
have
said
this
were
identical
offenses.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes
it
is.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
we
have
--
we
have
said,
these
are
identical
offenses
but
even
if
you
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes,
yes
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
even
if
we
assume
arguendo
cichos
was
subjected
to
double
jeopardy
here.
this
case
is
still
and
has
failed
because
of
the
failure
to
show
harmful
prejudice.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
he
was
not
prejudiced
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
jury
never
convicted
this
man
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
in
fact
he
was
both
times
convicted
of
reckless
homicide.
it
says
if
he
were
never
charged
with
involuntary
manslaughter.
i
must
admit
i
was
somewhat
taken
by
surprise
when
my
opponent
said
that
they
did
not
ask
for
a
bar
to
prosecution
if
they
--
if
this
court
found
and
has
favor
but
instead
asks
for
only
for
a
new
trial
in
the
reckless
homicide.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
it
--
its
doing
again
--
as
i
come
to
the
prejudice
question,
the
man
was
never,
never
convicted
of
involuntary
manslaughter,
it
says
if
he
were
never
charged
with
it.
in
this
case
you
don't
have
the
possible
prejudice
that
can
arise
from
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
from
defending
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
again,
now
we
have
to
move
all
the
way
back
to
the
indiana
law
requiring
a
complete
new
trial.
indiana
law
is
such
that
the
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
completely
all
over
again,
it's
as
if
there
were
--
as
if
there
were
no
first
trial.
so,
you're
starting
a
complete
--
with
a
complete
new
slate.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well,
you
would
have
an
inconsistent
verdict
your
honor
if
the
jury
came
in
and
said
we
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
guilty
of
reckless
homicide.
now,
you
have
and
inconsistent
verdict
but
they
don't
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
can
only
speculate
your
honor
but
i
would
say
as
a
free
man.
now
that
they
--
but
they
get
a
--
they
receive
a
charge
on
this.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
they
--
the
jury
has
charged
on
this
so
that
you
don't
have
this
situation,
their
charge
in
advance
to
bring
in
only
one
verdict.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
if
you
have
an
expressed
finding
by
the
jury,
if
the
jury
comes
in
and
expressly
acquits
the
man
on
either
charge
as
i
say
because
the
--
you
have
identical
offenses
involved,
identical
requirements
of
proof,
he
is
a
free
man
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
right,
you
would
have
an
inconsistent
verdict.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
four
identical
counts
your
honor?
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
all
arising
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
you
could
have
the
same
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
you
could
have
four
different
people
involved.
no,
the
same
one
defendant,
four
different
counts,
same
transaction.
that'd
be
kind
of
shocking,
wouldn't
it?
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well,
that's
not
on
this
case
but
i
don't
think
that
would
violate
the
constitution
now
as
i
think
about
it
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
because
for
this
reason
you
would
not
be
requiring
defense
counsel
prepared
but
for
one
defense,
you
see.
now
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
even
if
we
assume
that
he
was
placed
in
jeopardy
your
honor,
you
still
have
the
necessity
of
showing
prejudice
--
harmful
prejudice.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
he
was
placed
in
jeopardy
but
of
course
at
that
point
he
had
waived
his
jeopardy
when
he
went
up
to
appeal
on
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
going
back
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
he
must
take
his
appeal
under
the
way
indiana
courts
as
it
long
as
it's
not
discriminatory.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well,
i
--
it
would
necessarily
be
a
part
of
both
your
honor
because
the
fact
that
if
you
--
you
are
granted
a
new
trial,
the
slate
is
clean
and
you
start
all
over
again
as
if
no
trial
had
been
had.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
even
if
we
assume
your
honor
that
the
fact
that
there
was
double
jeopardy
here
again
as
i
say
you
don't
have
harmful
prejudice
and
double
jeopardy
like
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
he
was
never
convicted
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
both
times
the
jury
came
in
and
found
him
guilty
of
reckless
homicide.
you
see
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
because
here
unlike
in
green,
you
don't
have
a
failure
of
proof
in
the
sense
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
because
if
you
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
if
you
have
--
because
you
have
a
requirement
of
identical
proof
your
honor.
if
you
have
rejection,
one
--
if
you
have
a
rejection
that
rejects
on
both
you
cannot
have
both.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
is
right
on
the
punishment.
there
was
a
rejection
on
the
punishment
but
not
on
the
facts
as
far
as
guilt
is
concerned.
there
was
no
rejection
on
the
guilt
but
there
was
a
rejection
on
the
punishment
and
that
is
our
point.
this
was
a
mitigation
of
punishment
by
this
jury
and
not
an
acquittal
on
the
facts.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
exactly.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
exactly,
that's
true.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
exactly
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right
your
honor
and
that's
the
point
--
that's
the
reason
i
was
confused.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes,
your
honor
that
is
the
argument.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no,
that
was
my
opponent
that
was
arguing
that.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i'm
--
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
saying
there's
no
prejudice.
i'm
saying
there's
a
--
i
would
concede
there
would
be
a
possibility
of
prejudice
if
you
had
a
conviction
on
involuntary
manslaughter
in
that
second
trial.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no,
i
will
not
go
that
far
because
he
was
never
either.
never
was
he
acquitted
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
the
final
analysis,
i
am
compelled
to
defend
the
decision
by
this
court
in
palko
versus
connecticut
and
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
and
compelled
because
in
it's
very
core
and
in
its
very
heart
it
is
right.
it
is
right
because
it
recognizes
the
distinction
that
double
jeopardy
and
if
i
might
also
add
this
speedy
trial
clause,
the
sixth
amendment
stand
on
a
different
footing
on
the
remainder
of
the
bill
of
rights.
they
stand
on
a
different
category
because
now
with
these
two
you
deal
with
procedural
constitutional
rights
and
not
evidentiary
constitutional
rights
or
what
also
could
be
terms
substantive
constitutional
rights.
now,
i
draw
those
three
distinctions
in
the
sense
that
speedy
trial
and
double
jeopardy
constitute
a
bar
to
prosecution
when
they
are
violated.
you
have
a
violation
of
one
of
the
evidentiary
constitutional
rights,
he
receives
a
new
trial.
but
double
jeopardy
since
it
did
not
--
since
appellate
procedure
did
not
exist
at
common
law
as
it
does
in
modern
america
procedure
involves
questions
of
policy
and
policy
questions
which
are
not
subject
to
the
clear
mandate
of
a
constitution
should
be
left
to
court's
exercising
there
supervisory
powers.
therefore
the
policy
questions
should
be
left
to
the
highest
court's
of
the
states
rather
to
then
to
this
court
with
exception
and
this
exception
does
exist
that
this
court,
i
think
has
recognized
there
is
some
double
jeopardy
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
not
the
same
as
the
fifth
amendment
but
there
is
some
double
jeopardy
there.
well
that's
the
same
double
jeopardy
that
existed
at
common
law.
now,
the
double
jeopardy
in
the
fifth
amendment,
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
is
the
double
jeopardy
that
as
applies
in
the
federal
system
to
modern
appellate
procedure.
therefore
because
it
is
a
policy
question
it
should
be
left
--
supervisory
capacity
of
highest
courts
of
the
states
under
this
court
over
highest
courts
in
the
federal
system.
we
therefore
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
major
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
incorporated
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
and
therefore
directly
applicable
to
the
states
because
even
assuming
arguendo
that
it
is.
ronald
cichos
was
not
twice
put
in
jeopardy.
let
me
just
briefly
go
back
to
the
facts.
ronald
cichos
went
to
trial
on
a
two
count,
amended
affidavit
charging
him
with
reckless
homicide
and
involuntary
manslaughter.
the
jury
came
in
with
a
verdict,
finding
him
guilty
of
reckless
homicide.
from
that
verdict
he
filed
a
motion
for
new
trial.
the
trial
court
overruled
his
motion
and
from
the
ruling
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
he
appealed,
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
assigning
as
his
only
heir
the
trial
court's
ruling
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
supreme
court
of
indiana
granted
him
the
exact
relief
that
he
prayed
for.
they
grant
him
of
a
new
trial
which
in
indiana
under
indiana's
appellate
procedure
means
a
complete
new
trial.
and
this
is
what
he
received
on
the
second
trial
and
also
he
received
an
identical
verdict.the
jury
again
came
in
finding
him
guilty
of
reckless
homicide.
it
is
our
position
that
the
petitioner's
reliance
upon
green
versus
united
states
is
completely
unfounded.
green
versus
united
states
is
wholly
inapplicable
to
the
case
at
bar
on
--
for
several
reasons,
one
of
which
is
the
waiver
question.
now
this
court
rejected
the
government's
contentions
on
waiver
on
the
double
jeopardy
on
--
after
a
--
the
granting
of
a
new
trial
in
green
versus
united
states.
but
that
however
does
not
dispose
of
the
question
on
waiver
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
in
this
case
you're
dealing
with
state
appellate
procedure
and
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
state
to
provide
a
system
of
appellate
review.
does
not
provide
a
system
of
appellate
--
require
a
system
of
appellate
procedure.
this
court
in
mckane
verus
durston
said
that
a
state
may
accord
an
appeal
upon
whatever
terms
it
deems
proper
which
was
cited
with
approval
in
griffin
v.
illinois.
so
it
is
our
position
first
of
all
that
ronald
cichos
waived
the
double
jeopardy
question
when
he
sought
a
new
trial
in
the
indiana
supreme
court.
the
only
limitation
that
this
court
is
put
upon
mckane
v.
durston
was
that
in
griffin
v.
illinois
when
it
said,
"the
state's
appellate
court
system
cannot
be
discriminatory
under
the
equal
protection
clause."
it's
not
to
say
that
a
state
must
provide
a
system
of
appellate
review
but
only
that
it
cannot
be
discriminatory.
so,
the
waiver
question
cannot
be
decided
by
this
court
in
the
same
way
that
was
decided
in
green
because
you
are
dealing
with
two
different
systems
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
appeal.
it
must
hold
ronald
cichos
has
waived
the
double
jeopardy
question
but
even
if
we
assume
arguendo
that
he
has
not
waived
the
double
jeopardy
question,
ronald
cichos
was
never
twice
put
in
jeopardy
in
this
case.
because
it's
been
pointed
out
indiana
law
and
we
will
agree
with
mr.
price,
reckless
homicide
and
involuntary
manslaughter
where
an
automobile
is
involved
or
identical
offenses
requiring
identical
proof
only
the
punishment
differs.
reckless
homicide
carries
a
punishment
of
1
to
5
as
in
this
case,
involuntary
manslaughter
2
to
21.
it
is
for
this
reason
--
it
is
our
position
that
stroud
versus
united
states
is
controlling
in
the
case
at
bar
and
not
green
versus
united
states
because
here
you
cannot
say
that
the
jury
silence
is
tantamount
to
acquittal.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
it
is
not
in
the
record
to
my
knowledge
and
i
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
am
--
i'm
quite
convinced
that
it
would
be
on
the
original
record.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
do.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
do
not
know
as
a
fact.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
the
jury
however,
it
would
appear
from
the
supreme
court's
opinion
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out
was
aware
of
this
and
therefore
the
jury's
silence
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
count
must
be
taken
as
a
manifestation
of
mercy
and
certainly
not
acquittal
because
the
fact
that
you
have
the
identical
fact
patterns
and
proof
required.
now,
this
is
what
distinguishes
this
case
in
green
versus
united
states
is
the
failure
of
proof
question.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
proof
required
for
felony
murder,
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter.
well
in
green,
you
had
a
man
who
was
convicted,
charged
and
convicted
of
felony
murder.
after
this
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
after
which
they
went
back
for
a
new
trail
and
he
was
found
guilty
of
felony
murder.
now,
--
well
the
distinctions
are
subtle,
there
is
a
difference
on
the
proof
required
between
felony
murder
and
second
degree
murder.
felony
murder
requires
proof
of
a
killing
and
the
perpetration
of
one
of
the
common
law
felonies.
in
this
instance
it
was
arson.
second
degree
murder
is
a
finding
of
a
killing
with
malice
in
the
absence
of
premeditation.
so
it's
possible
for
the
prosecution
to
have
failed
in
its
proof
in
that
first
trial
in
green
and
then
come
back
for
another
chance
at
it
in
the
second
trial.
it
might
contrast
in
stroud
versus
united
states
you
had
a
man
who
went
to
trial
three
times
for
first
degree
murder.
the
first
time
he
received
the
death
sentence.
after
a
successful
appeal,
he
received
a
sentence
--
i
think
it
was
life.
after
again
a
successful
appeal
he
received
the
death
sentence
and
this
court
affirmed
the
decision
below
saying
that
the
jury's
decision
in
that
second
case
was
not
a
failure
of
proof,
it's
not
sufficient
to
put
him
on
double
jeopardy
but
was
nothing
more
than
a
manifestation
of
mercy
on
the
part
of
the
jury
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
don't
think
it
would
violate
the
constitution
your
honor
unless
you
have
--
you
would
have
a
situation
such
as
happened
in
green
even
though
they
are
the
same
punishment.
the
fact
that
you
might
have
will
say
all
three
are
charged
and
they
might
fail
to
come
in.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well,
it
would
depend
again.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
it
would
depend
upon
the
facts
requiring
proof.
if
the
same
facts
are
required
for
all
three
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
alright,
then
you
don't
have
double
jeopardy
because
you
have
to
have
--
in
order
to
have
double
jeopardy
you've
got
to
have
the
distinctions
and
proof.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
to
have
the
acquittal.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
oh,
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
the
course
question,
yes
i
do
agree
that
would
--
double
jeopardy
in
that
sense.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
here
you
have
actually
two
different
offenses
but
on
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
he'll
only
be
punished
once.
but
if
the
jury
comes
in
and
finds
him
not
guilty
of
one
and
silent
on
the
other
he
stands
a
free
man.
but
if
the
jury
comes
in
and
finds
him
guilty
on
one
and
a
silent
on
the
other,
he
must
pay
his
debt
to
society
and
go
to
jail.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
oh,
yes.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
the
law
is
not
clear
your
honor
but
i
think
in
light
of
the
indiana
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
i
don't
think
you
could.
it
would
stand
as
bar
for
the
prosecution.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no,
i
--
it's
not
this
case
your
honor.
i
can't
cite
exactly,
it's
the
roger's
case,
and
i
believe
the
backman
(ph)
case
with
both
i
believe
to
this
conclusion.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
they
were
double
jeopardy
cases.
i
don't
recall
the
fact
pattern
in
those
cases
your
honor
because
they
were
not
specifically
involved
here.
but
from
those
cases
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
by
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no
sir,
by
affidavit
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
by
affidavit
which
is
--
it's
indiana's
practice.
it's
almost
identical
to
practice
by
information
the
federal
system.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
because
i
--
of
course
i'm
speculating,
i'm
looking
into
the
prosecutor's
mind.
prosecutor
would
feel
that
here
you
have
a
violation
possibly
both
--
of
both
statutes.
of
course
you
do
since
they
require
identical
proof.
so
you
prosecute
on
both
of
them
and
leave
it
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
they
want
to
send
him
away
for
2
to
21
or
send
him
away
for
1
to
5.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
will
not
foreclose
the
possibility
your
honor
but
it
is
not
in
this
case.
it's
not
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
would
be
inclined
to
agree
with
your
honor
at
first
reading
the
statute.
however
i
do
not
interpret
the
law
in
indiana
but
that
is
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
they
have
said
this
were
identical
offenses.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes
it
is.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
we
have
--
we
have
said,
these
are
identical
offenses
but
even
if
you
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes,
yes
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
even
if
we
assume
arguendo
cichos
was
subjected
to
double
jeopardy
here.
this
case
is
still
and
has
failed
because
of
the
failure
to
show
harmful
prejudice.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
he
was
not
prejudiced
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
jury
never
convicted
this
man
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
in
fact
he
was
both
times
convicted
of
reckless
homicide.
it
says
if
he
were
never
charged
with
involuntary
manslaughter.
i
must
admit
i
was
somewhat
taken
by
surprise
when
my
opponent
said
that
they
did
not
ask
for
a
bar
to
prosecution
if
they
--
if
this
court
found
and
has
favor
but
instead
asks
for
only
for
a
new
trial
in
the
reckless
homicide.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
it
--
its
doing
again
--
as
i
come
to
the
prejudice
question,
the
man
was
never,
never
convicted
of
involuntary
manslaughter,
it
says
if
he
were
never
charged
with
it.
in
this
case
you
don't
have
the
possible
prejudice
that
can
arise
from
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
from
defending
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
again,
now
we
have
to
move
all
the
way
back
to
the
indiana
law
requiring
a
complete
new
trial.
indiana
law
is
such
that
the
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
completely
all
over
again,
it's
as
if
there
were
--
as
if
there
were
no
first
trial.
so,
you're
starting
a
complete
--
with
a
complete
new
slate.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well,
you
would
have
an
inconsistent
verdict
your
honor
if
the
jury
came
in
and
said
we
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
guilty
of
reckless
homicide.
now,
you
have
and
inconsistent
verdict
but
they
don't
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i
can
only
speculate
your
honor
but
i
would
say
as
a
free
man.
now
that
they
--
but
they
get
a
--
they
receive
a
charge
on
this.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
they
--
the
jury
has
charged
on
this
so
that
you
don't
have
this
situation,
their
charge
in
advance
to
bring
in
only
one
verdict.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
if
you
have
an
expressed
finding
by
the
jury,
if
the
jury
comes
in
and
expressly
acquits
the
man
on
either
charge
as
i
say
because
the
--
you
have
identical
offenses
involved,
identical
requirements
of
proof,
he
is
a
free
man
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
right,
you
would
have
an
inconsistent
verdict.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
four
identical
counts
your
honor?
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
all
arising
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
you
could
have
the
same
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
you
could
have
four
different
people
involved.
no,
the
same
one
defendant,
four
different
counts,
same
transaction.
that'd
be
kind
of
shocking,
wouldn't
it?
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well,
that's
not
on
this
case
but
i
don't
think
that
would
violate
the
constitution
now
as
i
think
about
it
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
because
for
this
reason
you
would
not
be
requiring
defense
counsel
prepared
but
for
one
defense,
you
see.
now
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well
even
if
we
assume
that
he
was
placed
in
jeopardy
your
honor,
you
still
have
the
necessity
of
showing
prejudice
--
harmful
prejudice.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
he
was
placed
in
jeopardy
but
of
course
at
that
point
he
had
waived
his
jeopardy
when
he
went
up
to
appeal
on
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
going
back
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
he
must
take
his
appeal
under
the
way
indiana
courts
as
it
long
as
it's
not
discriminatory.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
well,
i
--
it
would
necessarily
be
a
part
of
both
your
honor
because
the
fact
that
if
you
--
you
are
granted
a
new
trial,
the
slate
is
clean
and
you
start
all
over
again
as
if
no
trial
had
been
had.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
but
even
if
we
assume
your
honor
that
the
fact
that
there
was
double
jeopardy
here
again
as
i
say
you
don't
have
harmful
prejudice
and
double
jeopardy
like
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
he
was
never
convicted
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
both
times
the
jury
came
in
and
found
him
guilty
of
reckless
homicide.
you
see
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
because
here
unlike
in
green,
you
don't
have
a
failure
of
proof
in
the
sense
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
because
if
you
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
if
you
have
--
because
you
have
a
requirement
of
identical
proof
your
honor.
if
you
have
rejection,
one
--
if
you
have
a
rejection
that
rejects
on
both
you
cannot
have
both.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
your
honor
is
right
on
the
punishment.
there
was
a
rejection
on
the
punishment
but
not
on
the
facts
as
far
as
guilt
is
concerned.
there
was
no
rejection
on
the
guilt
but
there
was
a
rejection
on
the
punishment
and
that
is
our
point.
this
was
a
mitigation
of
punishment
by
this
jury
and
not
an
acquittal
on
the
facts.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
exactly.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
exactly,
that's
true.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
exactly
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
that's
right
your
honor
and
that's
the
point
--
that's
the
reason
i
was
confused.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
yes,
your
honor
that
is
the
argument.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no,
that
was
my
opponent
that
was
arguing
that.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
i'm
--
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
saying
there's
no
prejudice.
i'm
saying
there's
a
--
i
would
concede
there
would
be
a
possibility
of
prejudice
if
you
had
a
conviction
on
involuntary
manslaughter
in
that
second
trial.
mr.
douglas
b.
mcfadden
no,
i
will
not
go
that
far
because
he
was
never
either.
never
was
he
acquitted
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
the
final
analysis,
i
am
compelled
to
defend
the
decision
by
this
court
in
palko
versus
connecticut
and
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
and
compelled
because
in
it's
very
core
and
in
its
very
heart
it
is
right.
it
is
right
because
it
recognizes
the
distinction
that
double
jeopardy
and
if
i
might
also
add
this
speedy
trial
clause,
the
sixth
amendment
stand
on
a
different
footing
on
the
remainder
of
the
bill
of
rights.
they
stand
on
a
different
category
because
now
with
these
two
you
deal
with
procedural
constitutional
rights
and
not
evidentiary
constitutional
rights
or
what
also
could
be
terms
substantive
constitutional
rights.
now,
i
draw
those
three
distinctions
in
the
sense
that
speedy
trial
and
double
jeopardy
constitute
a
bar
to
prosecution
when
they
are
violated.
you
have
a
violation
of
one
of
the
evidentiary
constitutional
rights,
he
receives
a
new
trial.
but
double
jeopardy
since
it
did
not
--
since
appellate
procedure
did
not
exist
at
common
law
as
it
does
in
modern
america
procedure
involves
questions
of
policy
and
policy
questions
which
are
not
subject
to
the
clear
mandate
of
a
constitution
should
be
left
to
court's
exercising
there
supervisory
powers.
therefore
the
policy
questions
should
be
left
to
the
highest
court's
of
the
states
rather
to
then
to
this
court
with
exception
and
this
exception
does
exist
that
this
court,
i
think
has
recognized
there
is
some
double
jeopardy
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
not
the
same
as
the
fifth
amendment
but
there
is
some
double
jeopardy
there.
well
that's
the
same
double
jeopardy
that
existed
at
common
law.
now,
the
double
jeopardy
in
the
fifth
amendment,
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
is
the
double
jeopardy
that
as
applies
in
the
federal
system
to
modern
appellate
procedure.
therefore
because
it
is
a
policy
question
it
should
be
left
--
supervisory
capacity
of
highest
courts
of
the
states
under
this
court
over
highest
courts
in
the
federal
system.
we
therefore
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
