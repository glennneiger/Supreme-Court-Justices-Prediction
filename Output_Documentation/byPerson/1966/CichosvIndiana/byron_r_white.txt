justice

white
with
different
punishments
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
i
understand,
you're
using
the
word
qualitatively
mr.
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
are
there
more
elements
in
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
don't
quite
understand
the
--
what's
the
difference,
that
only
in
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
difference
in
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
the
reckless
homicide
one
ingredient
has
to
be
death
by
automobile?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
in
involuntary
manslaughter
necessarily?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
punishment
of
why,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
in
the
record?
i
suppose
it
must
be
somewhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
in
the
original
record
filed
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
file
was
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
makes
some
sense
though,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
that
there's
been
expressed
verdict.
guilty
on
reckless
homicide,
count
one,
not
guilty
on
involuntary
manslaughter
and
that
is
a
--
you
say,
is
absolutely
inconsistent
verdict
in
which
way
would
you
run
it?
that
he's
guilty
on
both
or
not
guilty
on
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
have
this
(inaudible)
because
there
wasn't
an
express
verdict
here.
the
indiana
supreme
court
said
they
would
not
apply
this
normal
rule
of
inferring
if
acquittal
from
silence
in
this
case
because
of
the
confusing
nature
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they've
gotten
--
that's
the
way
they've
avoided
this
called
fact,
it
seems
to
me
is
doing
there
own
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
indiana
supreme
court
said
that
in
this
state
under
this
statute
we
do
not
imply
an
acquittal
from
the
silence
of
the
jury.
didn't
they
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
they
said
there
has
been
no
acquittal
in
this
case
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
indiana
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
court
said
they
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
is
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
direct
form
there
which
permits
an
acquittal
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
just
one
or
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
just
guilty
of
one
or
the
other
or
both
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
a
general
verdict,
he's
deemed
to
become
guilty
of
only
one,
mainly
the
one
carrying
the
highest
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
it
--
aren't
you
also
arguing
that
even
if
they
were
different
and
certain
they
were
different
in
regards
to
punishment.
but
on
the
second
trial
he
was
found
guilty
of
the
lesser
offense
again
and
he
may
have
been
in
double
jeopardy
but
why
should
the
case
be
reversed?
what
you
really
have
to
do
to
reverse
this
case
then
i
would
suppose
you
would
argue
is
to
say
that
he
couldn't
have
been
retried
on
reck
--
for
reckless
homicide
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
really
the
argument
at
this
stage,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
i'm
looking
at
this
original
transcript
and
the
court's
instruction
number
10
has
this
in
it,
if
you
find
defendant
guilty
on
either
count
on
the
affidavit
and
say
nothing
about
the
other
count
that
would
be
equivalent
to
finding
him
not
guilty
on
the
count
you
do
not
mention.
now,
the
indiana
supreme
court
seems
to
disagree
with
that
but
whether
it
does
or
it
doesn't,
wasn't
the
jury
told
what
it
would
be
doing
if
it
didn't
mention
count
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
--
we're
not
just
relying
upon
some
kind
of
a
presumption
or
rule
in
this
case
then.
this
is
precisely
what
the
jury
was
told.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
this
is
still
--
that
instruction
is
still
the
law
at
least
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
this
case
at
least?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
--
is
that
you're
asking?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
asking
--
you
don't
--
you're
not
saying
that
you
would
be
barred
from
being
retried
for
reckless
homicide.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
different
punishments
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not

i

i
don't
quite

the

what's

justice
byron

white
what's
the

justice

then
the

justice

so
that
they
said
there
has
been
no

in
this
case
of
involuntary

justice
byron

even
though
