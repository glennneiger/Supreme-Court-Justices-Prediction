justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
do
you
drive
that
from
indiana
case
law?
justice
abe
fortas
not
upon
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
statutes
--
just
a
casual
reading
of
the
statutes
would
not
indicate
that
that
is
so?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
statute
set
out
on
page
14
in
your
brief,
reckless
homicide
and
then
involuntary
manslaughter.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
there
in
the
indiana
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
that
leads
you
to
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(voice
overlap)
what
are
those
case
--
what's
the
legal
proposition
in
those
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
the
elements
--
if
the
elements
is
i
think
mr.
justice
black
was
submitting
to
you
at
the
elements
of
the
two
crimes
are
the
same
then
conviction
or
acquittal
on
one
stand
which
is
jeopardy,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
he
can't
be
tried
on
the
other?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
in
this
case
this
prosecution
was
started
by
a
presentment,
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
not
by
indictment?
justice
abe
fortas
by
what?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
why
did
the
prosecutors
choose
to
charge
on
the
both
reckless
homicide
and
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
any
legal
--
is
there
any
constitutional
problem
presented
by
this
kind
of
a
la
carte
choice
of
weaponry?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
i
must
say,
look
at
your
indiana
cases
but
again
just
reading
the
statute
i
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
assuming
and
going
along
with
the
--
you
and
your
opponent
on
the
proposition
that
these
offenses
that
contain
exactly
the
same
elements
and
for
example
in
the
face
of
the
statute
involuntary
manslaughter
crime
requires
proof
of
--
the
violation
of
the
law
and
for
reckless
disregard
the
--
you
don't
have
to
prove
that,
is
that
so
or
do
i
misreading
it?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
in
you
brief,
is
it?
or
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
is?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
mean,
when
you
cited
indiana
cases
in
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
manslaughter,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
defendant
were
charge
in
four
identical
counts
in
involuntary
manslaughter,
do
you
think
that's
appropriate?
justice
abe
fortas
all,
within
--
justice
abe
fortas
presumably
could
be
a
sentence
under
each
count.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice

transactions.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
don't
have
any
doubts
that
jeopardy
attaches
here
with
respect
to
both
counts
on
this
--
when
the
trial
starts,
the
jury
is
compelled
or
whatever
your
local
rule
may
be?
justice
abe
fortas
jeopardy
counts
with
--
attaches
with
respect
to
both
counts.
if
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
jeopardy
did
attach
here
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
count,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
as
long
as
your
reckless
homicide,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
position
is
that
although
the
case
went
to
judgment
on
the
reckless
homicide
charge
and
only
the
reckless
homicide
charge
conviction
was
appealed
and
reversed
for
a
new
trial
that
some
how
rather
the
involuntary
manslaughter
count
remained
alive
in
a
kind
of
a
deep
freeze
during
all
of
this
so
without
jeopardy
attaching
but
at
some
or
rather
the
an
attachment
of
jeopardy
was
wiped
out
or
had
no
affect.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
have
to
assume
he
was
placed
in
jeopardy
don't
you
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
as
--
rather
as
well
as
reckless
homicide?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
that's
another
question.
justice
abe
fortas
he
didn't
go
up
to
appeal
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
charge
anyway,
did
he?
justice
abe
fortas
would
this
--
does
indiana
law
say
anything
specifically
on
that
that
you're
convicted
on
one
count
then
you
have
to
appeal
on
in
--
on
both?
