what's
your
circuit
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
leave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
a
nolle
prosequi
without
or
with
leave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
on
the
limitations
from
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
on
whether
i
understood
you're
correctly
or
not.
did
i
understand
you
directly
to
say
that
if
this
man
certainly
would
decide
now
to
prosecute
this
very
man
that
this
very
man
could
then
offer
defense
which
the
state
would
have
said
because
of
the
delay
of
prosecuting
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
all
your
--
all
your
contra
verdict
here
is
that
as
i
gather
it
states
right
to
keep
some
intending
against
him,
state
knows
he
shouldn't
be
convicted
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
does
the
state
do
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
he
is
the
man
charged
with
an
offense
or
which
he
has
a
good
defense
which
would
be
recognized
and
he
become
lose
but
he
has
denied
any
right
to
raise
it
in
states
of
north
carolina.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whatever
it
is,
he
is
denied
the
right
to
raise,
that
he
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
under
this,
it's
none
of
the
constituting
return
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
does
the
state
of
north
carolina
not
confess
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
revealed
in
time
to
put
up
a
defense
to
a
charge
defending
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
confession
here,
i
understand
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
are
you
not
confessing
to
claim
openly
flagrant
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
fight
this
position
in
all
criminal
prosecution
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
and
public
trial
in
part
of
jury
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
to
be
a
trial
if
this
amendment
applies
to
the
state,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know,
how
they
have
come
up
before
what
we
have
here
is
where
the
record
shows
you
admit
that
the
man
is
being
denied
speedy
public
trial
when
he
is
tried
for
an
offense.
now,
if
the
sixth
amendment
applies
to
the
state
isn't
that
a
violation?
he
is
not
being
--
he
is
not
enjoined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
are
charged
in,
they
have
an
offense
of
pending
against
him
and
they
will
not
give
him
the
benefit
of
a
speedy
trial
to
admit
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
doesn't
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
why
do
they
have
to
raise
it
in
any
one
particularly
the
man.
the
man
is
charged
with
an
offense
in
the
state
and
they
will
not
give
him
a
trial,
why
doesn't
that
violate
the

no.
