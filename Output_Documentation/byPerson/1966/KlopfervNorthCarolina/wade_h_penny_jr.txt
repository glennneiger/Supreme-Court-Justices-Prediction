mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
north
carolina.
that
court
in
a
decision
rendered
in
january
of
this
year
held
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
acting
through
its
solicitor
and
the
trial
court
made
by
procedural
device
known
under
north
carolina
law
as
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
permanently
and
completely
deprived
by
criminal
defendant
of
his
day
in
court.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
although
discussion
of
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
normally
proceeds
from
a
concern
with
what
is
an
unreasonable
delay.
here,
the
state
of
north
carolina
takes
the
unprecedented,
we
submit,
view
that
the
state
may
permanently
and
completely
deprive
a
defendant
of
his
day
in
court
and
in
doing
so
repudiates
the
basic
principle
of
our
system
of
law
that
every
man
accused
to
crime
regardless
of
the
degree
of
the
offense
or
its
seriousness,
regardless
of
his
station
in
life
is
nevertheless
unequivocally
entitled
to
his
day
in
court
to
establish
his
innocence
and
with
the
opportunity
to
secure
his
exoneration.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
this
petitioner's
contact
with
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
no
frivolous
skirmish.
this
defendant
was
first
indicted
in
february
of
1964
for
the
grand
jury
of
orange
county
upon
a
bill
of
indictment
charging
him
with
trespass
which
under
north
carolina
law
is
punishable
both
by
a
sentence
and
fine
or
either
one
of
the
two.
pursuant
to
that
bill
of
indictment
of
february
this
defendant
was
brought
to
trial
at
the
special
criminal
session
in
march
of
1964
and
after
a
lengthy
trial
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree
whereupon
this
defendant
was
then
directed
to
appear
in
court
on
the
following
monday.
however,
no
further
proceeding
was
taken
in
march
with
a
crowded
criminal
docket
at
that
time
in
orange
county
for
one
reason
or
another.
the
case
although
it
appeared
once
or
twice
on
the
criminal
docket
there
was
no
further
trial
proceeding
and
then
in
the
spring
of
1965,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
inquired
of
the
state
as
to
what
the
state's
position
in
this
case
would
be
in
the
light
of
the
passage
of
the
1964
federal
civil
rights
act
and
even
more
in
point
this
court's
decision
in
hamm
versus
city
of
rock
hill
applying
that
act
retroactively.
the
solicitor
indicated
as
the
record
shows
that
he
intended
to
take
what
is
known
as
is
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
in
april
of
1965
when
this
case
was
once
again
on
the
docket
of
orange
county
superior
court,
this
petitioner
through
his
counsel
appeared
in
open
court
and
objected
to
that
procedural
point
being
taken
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
entered
in
the
record.
the
court
animated
at
that
time
that
it
agreed
with
the
state
that
it
might
have
the
nolle
prosequi
entered.
then
the
solicitor
having
a
change
of
heart
decided
that
he
wanted
the
case
back
on
the
trial
calendar
right
at
that
moment
in
open
court.
now,
the
next
session
of
the
orange
county
superior
court
then
occurred
in
august
of
1965.
prior
to
that
session
of
court,
it
was
ascertained
that
this
petitioner's
case
was
not
on
the
trial
docket
and
then
an
effort
to
bring
the
matter
to
some
conclusion,
petitioner
filed
a
motion
in
the
orange
county
superior
court
wherein
he
outlined
the
chronology
as
to
the
issuance
of
the
indictment
and
this
prior
context
with
the
court,
and
further
urged
upon
the
court
that
he
have
an
affirmative
defense
to
any
further
attempt
to
prosecute
this
case.
in
that
first
of
all,
this
prosecution
arose
out
of
a
set
of
circumstances
which
constitute
or
which
where
in
the
course
of
a
civil
rights
demonstration
wherein
the
petitioner
assault
service
that
i
placed
which
he
contended
in
this
motion
was
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
he
referred
in
that
motion
to
the
civil
rights
act,
to
his
contention
that
hamm
applied
--
the
hamm
decision
applied
in
his
case
and
in
more
particular
cited
the
superior
court
to
the
case
rendered
by
this
court
in
1965
blow
versus
north
carolina
applying
the
civil
rights
act
under
the
hamm
decision
retroactively
and
pointed
out
in
his
motion
that
the
facts
in
his
case
where
as
to
the
operative
facts
very
similar
to
the
blow
decision.
at
no
point
in
the
record
or
in
this
record
before
the
court
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
ever
seriously
contend
or
ever
contend
at
all
for
that
matter
that
the
statement
in
this
motion
where
incorrect.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
mr.
justice
white
we
got
a
ruling
in
the
sense
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
motion
and
presentation
open
court,
the
state
renewed
its
motion
for
that
an
entry
being
made
of
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
and
that
was
granted.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
your
honor
that
they
never,
the
court
never
attempt
to
go
into
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well
the
motion
act,
the
motion
did
not
immediately
request
the
ruling
on
the
merits
of
that
contention.
what
it
did
request
was
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
be
directed
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
law
and
to
allow
this
defendant
an
opportunity
to
present
those
contentions
in
orderly
procedure
in
the
state
court,
so
what
we
actually
asked
for
a
motion
was
that
the
judge
inquiring
to
why
the
state
of
north
carolina
was
not
willing
to
give
this
defendant
his
day
in
court
in
order
to
urge
this
point.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
your
honor,
this
question
has
engendered
some
discussion
among
the
members
of
the
bars.
it's
my
understanding
of
the
law
of
north
carolina
that
a
motion
to
quash
cannot
be
raise
in
advance
of
the
case
appearing
in
its
regular
order
upon
the
trial
docket.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
and
we
do
not
have
as
my
understanding
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that
the
defendant
on
his
own
motion
can
move
that
the
court
consider
his
case
when
it
is
not
in
regular.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not,
it
is
a
motion
to
request
the
court
to
make
effective
the
petitioner's
right
to
be
heard
in
open
court
in
regular
proceeding.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
let
me
explain
at
this
way
mr.
justice
brennan.
normally,
a
trial
judge
would
not
consider
any
case
on
the
docket.
i
mean
any
case
pending
before
the
court
unless
the
solicitor
has
placed
it
upon
the
docket.
now,
at
the
time
that
we
file
this
motion
our
case
was
pending
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
but
was
not
on
the
trial
docket
and
we
have
been
put
off
about
that.
in
april,
the
indication
by
the
solicitor
in
open
court
being
that
he
was
going
to
proceed
to
trial
this
particular
defendant,
and
all
that
we
were
saying
at
that
time
was
we
are
ready
to
proceed.
we
did
not
ask
or
demand
of
the
court
that
they
had
to
put
this
case
on
for
that
such.
what
we
did
was
the
court
under
its
general
supervisory
jurisdiction
to
in
effect
commit
the
state
to
a
debt
in
a
certain
time
when
they
would
give
us
our
day
in
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
i'll
briefly
explain
that
procedure
in
order
that
the
court
can
see
the
context
in
which
we
operate.
north
carolina
allows
the
solicitor
upon
his
own
initiative
as
to
any
case
pending
in
the
court
to
request
the
court
that
an
entry
be
made
either
of
nolle
prosequi
which
is
short
in
phrase
as
nol
pros
in
our
state
or
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
now,
the
effect
of
that
as
the
court
has
clearly
established
on
our
procedure
is
this,
number
one,
it
is
not
an
acquittal
if
merely
relives
the
defendant
from
having
to
attend
court
from
session
to
session,
and
secondly
releases
him
from
his
bond.
it
in
no
way
is
a
termination
of
the
action
because
the
court
has
explicitly
stated
that
the
state
may
either
proceed
upon
the
original
bill
of
indictment
at
any
time
or
issue
a
new
bill
of
indictment.
now,
the
distinction
and
there
is
but
one
distinction
between
nolle
prosequi
and
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
is
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
now
with
leave
means
--
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way,
under
a
nolle
prosequi
entry
in
order
for
the
solicitor
to
reinstitute
the
proceeding
he
would
have
to
first
apply
to
the
trial
judge
and
get
his
consent
and
a
trial
judge
would
issue
an
order
directing
the
clerk
of
court
to
issue
a
case.
but
then
at
that
point,
they
could
either
proceed
--
under
that
procedure
they
would
proceed
on
the
same
bill
of
indictment
or
if
he
did
not
want
that
instead
of
going
to
the
court
could
request
an
issue,
have
a
presentment
sent
to
the
grand
jury.
now
under
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
and
i
might
say
that
under
our
procedure
that
is
the
customary
entry
rather
than
just
a
limited
nolle
prosequi.
under
nolle
prosequi
with
leave,
the
words
with
leave
mean
in
effect
that
the
court
is
giving
its
consent
in
advance
that
the
solicitor
may
reinstitute
the
proceeding
without
any
further
consent
from
the
court
he
just
would
merely
walk
into
the
clerk's
office
given
the
docket
number
and
ask
to
dictate
his
issue
for
that
defendant.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
absolutely
not.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
your
honor,
there
were
some
concern
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
under
our
statutory
appellate
procedure
that
there
might
be
a
question
raised.
however,
there
was
no
question
raised
either
by
the
state
in
its
brief
nor
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
raised
from
the
brief
here.
so,
i
would
assume
that
the
statue
in
north
carolina
which
says
you
may
appeal
--
only
from
the
final
judgment
is
being
construed
here
to
mean
that
this
action
by
the
solicitor
at
least
as
to
the
facts,
the
defendant
has
filed.
it's
not
final
as
to
the
solicitor
under
north
carolina
procedure
but
it
is
final
as
to
this
petitioner
because
as
the
klopfer
case
opinion
in
the
state
court
indicates
there
is
no
other
procedure
now
available
to
this
petitioner
in
north
carolina
court
by
which
to
compel
the
state
to
allow
him
to
proceed
--
to
this
case.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
your
honor,
in
effect
we
may
be
dealing
here
as
the
question
has
been
raised
originally
with
the
possibility
of
semantics
actually
is
my
understanding
north
carolina
procedure
we
have
no
procedure
equivalent
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
initiating
from
the
defendant
it
would
be
under
the
basis
of
a
motion
to
quash
a
bill
of
indictment.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
we
would
contend
that
is
not
available
under
the
present
legal
status
of
this
case
because
we
have
no
way
to
get
back
on
the
docket
and
even
we
owned,
i
mean
even
there'd
be
a
question
whether
this
case
is
even
pending
in
that
court
now
for
purposes
of
directing
a
motion
to
the
superior
court
judge.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
if
we
could
made
a
motion
to
quash
at
this
point
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right
but
i
think
what
we
anticipate
on
the
north
carolina
procedure
the
reaction
would
have
been
while
this
case
that
is
premature
at
this
point
until
the
solicitor
calls
this
case
on
the
docket.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
your
honor
that's
the
way
i
read
the
--
the
court
was
appearing
on
because
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
says
that
the
defendant
may
not
compel
the
state
to
give
him
his
day
in
court
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
--
even
to
the
limited
basis
of
a
motion
to
quash.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
not
on
those
words,
your
honor
we
in
open
court
on
the
consideration
of
this
motion.
i
think
its
clear
from
the
contents
of
the
motion
in
fact
a
motion
specifically
states
that
to
defend
the
questions
whether
the
state
can
proceed
under
this
bill
of
indictment
and
so
what
we
were
saying
to
the
superior
court
is
that
the
question
or
whether
this
bill
of
indictment
is
valid
would
require
some
type
of
hearing
and
fact
finding
at
probably
preliminary
to
the
actual
trial
by
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
indictment
is
valid
or
not
and
so
in
our
motion
we
were
saying
that
we're
entitled
to
have
our
opportunity
in
court
of
--
to
present
that
motion.
and
as
i
understand
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
we
are
not
entitled
to
fail
the
state
to
give
us
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
there's
no
way
that
the
defendant
may
on
his
own
initiative
raise
that
question
as
i
understand
north
carolina
law.
now,
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
might
not
use
it
defensively
if
10
years
from
today
the
state
of
north
carolina
came
back
and
attempted
to
the
prosecute
that
within
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
state
was
barred
at
that
point
but
my
contention
is
that
this
procedure
of
north
carolina
now
indorse
by
this
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
is
final
as
to
this
petition
is
not
final
as
to
the
state.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
we
would
contend
that
the
under
the
circumstances
in
which
the
state
has
proceeded
particularly
after
we
put
the
state
on
notice
in
our
motion
that
we
had
not
just
a
question
of
contesting
their
evidence
but
the
affirmative
defense
based
upon
a
federal
statue
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
there
being
no
show
here
at
any
point
in
the
record
as
indeed
it's
not
required
under
north
carolina
to
show
those
of
why
there's
any
reason
for
delay
we
contend
that
the
action
of
the
state
here
was
so
arbitrary
and
capricious
as
to
justify
this
court
in
finding
that
the
right
to
speedy
trial
applies
that
it
has
been
unpardonably
violated
here
and
that
further
prosecution
is
barred
in
this
case
because
of
the
deprivation
in
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that
would
be
our
first
and
major
request.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
as
i
recall
our
brief
did
not
stress
the
first
amendment
point
that
it
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
in
this
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
appearing
up
on
page
18
in
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page.
we
point
out
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
where
a
trespass
charge
arises
out
of
this
defendant's
effort
to
change
what
is
a
prevailing
attitude
in
the
community
where
in
this
case
arose
or
at
least
was
so
the
prevailing
attitude
of
the
time
of
this
case
that
the
inevitable
effect
of
the
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
now
is
to
leave
his
future
status
under
this
charge
completely
open
the
question
and
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
quite
often
the
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
procedure
is
used
precisely
for
that
effect
not
necessarily
in
its
more
ordinary
concern
not
the
quail
and
restrict
first
amendment
rights
but
in
effect
you'll
often
have
a
case
where
perhaps
the
state's
witness
is
available
only
greater
expense
to
the
state
and
this
defendant
has
a
reasonably
good
record
and
the
state
decides
that
because
of
this
particular
defendant's
case
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
case
here
that
it's
not
worth
the
expense
to
the
state
in
that
kind
of
case
and
that
just
thread
of
this
prosecution
for
the
next
year
to
hanging
over
its
head
would
probably,
in
other
words
his
brush
with
the
law
even
though
it
doesn't
result
in
conviction
is
sufficient.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right
and
i
think
it
has
a
legitimate
(voice
overlap)
quite
often
has
legitimate
years
and
we
do
not
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
we
do
not
cite
at
this
procedure
per
se.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
let
me
say,
i
would
concede
it's
appropriate
only
if
the
defendant
in
effect
consents
to
it.
rather
consents
and
does
not
object
to
the
entry
of
the
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
in
other
words,
quite
often
the
defendant
is
just
as
delight
as
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
in
fact,
on
our
proceeding
in
the
superior
court
of
orange
county,
we
have
a
little
difficulty
with
the
superior
court
judge
and
taking
--
in
trying
to
take
me
seriously
that
i
was
opposing
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so
from
--
i'll
say
under
normal
practice
99%
of
the
time
in
ordinary
criminal
case
is
it
is.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
not
in
a
sensible
note,
the
very
assertion
as
was
used
here
and
i
might
say
your
honor
this
case
was
hardly
contested
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
violation
in
north
carolina
trespass
law,
it
took
approximately
three
days
to
come
out.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
i
think
for
this
i
think
the
objection
that
we
contend
for
applied
equally
whether
it's
with
or
without
leave
because
we
contend
that
this
procedure
transgresses
vital
interest
of
a
criminal
defendant
whether
it's
with
or
without
leave
if
the
state
construes
that
it
has
giving
the
absolute
and
final
and
complete
authority
to
for
ever
denying
this
day
in
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right
and
it's
as
far
as
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
that's
the
crucial
point
in
the
case
and
the
reason
that
that
puts
the
weight
and
burden
upon
the
defendant
and
that
is
that
the
statute
to
limitations
which
is
only
two
years
in
a
misdemeanor
case
does
not
ran
during
dependency
of
the
nolle
prosequi
entry.
now,
if
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
either
one.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
either
one
told
the
statute
of
limitations.
now,
if
that
characteristic
of
the
nolle
prosequi
procedure
was
not
present
then
we
would
not
be
here
today
because
the
statute
of
limitations
would
come
in
and
terminate.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
i
contend
that
all
cases
disposed
of
by
the
nolle
prosequi
procedure
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant
(voice
overlap)
urge
in
trial
does
transgress
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that
he
has
to
offer
any
burden
as
upon
him.
in
terms
of
reality
it
may
be
and
i
would
suppose
the
case
where
it's
quite
conclusive
that
he's
going
to
be
found
guilty
but
i
don't
think
that
would
be
in
anyway
irrelevant
consideration
by
the
trial
court.
i
think
he
is
entitled.
however,
misguided
and
overly
optimistic
he
may
be,
he's
entitled
to
remove
from
himself
the
personal
anxiety
and
apprehension
of
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
to
try
to
escape
the
quite
often
and
the
serious
impact
which
a
criminal
charge
pending
criminal
charge
would
have
offend
his
reputation
in
standing
in
the
community.
and
likewise
to
take
steps
to
avoid
the
delay
impairing
his
opportunity
to
present
such
defenses
he
may
have
in
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
in
the
sentence
immediately
before
that
mr.
justice
brennan
was
first
urged
that
under
these
circumstances
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
of
the
state
justifies
barring
it
as
on
the
grounds
of
the
very
basic
constitutional
right
but
at
the
very
least
we're
entitled
to
what
we
sold
in
our
original
motion
and
that
is
the
opportunity
to
present
our
defense
on
its
merits
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
actually
north
carolina's
nolle
prosequi
procedure
is
not
grounded
on
a
statute
as
i
understand
that's
a
carryover
from
the
procedural
device
under
the
same
name
of
common
law.
at
least
our
courts
cites
no
statute
and
we
have
one
or
two
--
have
one
statute
in
particular
that
says
that
where
a
defendant
has
been
indicted
and
has
not
been
apprehended
within
two
terms
of
court
that
the
clerk
of
court
may
have
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
entered
and
i
think
that
is
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
administrative
convenience
in
order
to
get
it
off
the
docket
because
the
defendant
may
never
admit
it.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
my
understanding
that
some
states
do
not
go
with
the
position
that
north
carolina
has
of
the
nolle
prosequi
statute,
i'm
afraid
to
say
it
does
told
the
statute.
the
only
use
that
has
ever
been
suggested
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
to
use
this
procedure
is
in
a
case
where
the
state
does
not
feel
it
has
sufficient
evidence
to
proceed
and
secure
a
conviction
but
even
that
consideration
if
it
were
justifiable
a
moment
eventually
the
total
of
time
cuts
that
off
because
it's
equally
cogent
and
likely
that
there
is
no
such
evidence
to
ever
be
obtained
and
if
there
is
none
this
defendant
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
this
case
of
state
versus
williams
that's
cited
in
the
brief.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
state
versus
williams.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
actually,
he
was
arrested
in
the
presence
of
the
deputy
sheriff
on
the
night
of
january
3rd,
the
night
of
the
alleged
occurrence.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
1964.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
and
then
it
went
into
recorder's
court
and
the
state
did
not
want
to
try
the
case
in
recorder's
court
and
went
up
in
to
the
superior
court
and
on
motion
of
the
state
in
normal
procedure
there
is
to
seek
an
indictment.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
to
this
offense,
the
statute
limitations
would
be
two
years.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
we
have
no
statute
on
felonies
so
if
these
were
felony
charge
the
effect
that
it
told
the
statute
wouldn't
make
any
difference
but
it
would
still
involve
the
basic
considerations
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
except
for
the
nolle
prosequi
we
would
have
either
have
our
hearing
in
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right,
assume
nothing
had
happen
this
would've
ran.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
yes
that
was
made
within
one
month.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
it
was
actually
told
by
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
on
the
day
after
the
offense
and
then
of
course
the
warrant
comes
up
to
a
point
then
he's
bound
over
the
bill
of
indictment
fixed
it
up
at
that
point.
so,
as
of
this
moment
utmost
the
not
more
than
one
day
of
the
two
years
has
actually
ran
as
of
this
point.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
and
yet
come
february
we
will
look
--
at
three
years
actually
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
now
that
the
point
is
now
that
it's
told
forever
and
that
therefore
there
is
as
to
this
defendant
this
procedure
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
state
of
north
carolina
says
that
that
there
is
no
relief
available
to
compel
a
trial
that
explicitly
states
we
may
not
compel
trial
and
yet
it
is
not
conclusive
on
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
reason
it's
not
conclusive
as
a
termination
of
this
case
is
that
it
owes
the
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor
and
even
as
i
read
north
carolina
nolle
prosequi
procedure
as
long
is
there
is
a
nolle
prosequi
for
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
entry
in
a
case
brought
within
the
original
statute
of
limitations
if
they
want
to
they
can
go
back
and
get
a
new
bill
of
indictment
and
proceed
upon
that.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
the
bill
is
still
outstanding
under
our
nolle
prosequi
procedure.
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
north
carolina.
that
court
in
a
decision
rendered
in
january
of
this
year
held
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
acting
through
its
solicitor
and
the
trial
court
made
by
procedural
device
known
under
north
carolina
law
as
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
permanently
and
completely
deprived
by
criminal
defendant
of
his
day
in
court.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
although
discussion
of
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
normally
proceeds
from
a
concern
with
what
is
an
unreasonable
delay.
here,
the
state
of
north
carolina
takes
the
unprecedented,
we
submit,
view
that
the
state
may
permanently
and
completely
deprive
a
defendant
of
his
day
in
court
and
in
doing
so
repudiates
the
basic
principle
of
our
system
of
law
that
every
man
accused
to
crime
regardless
of
the
degree
of
the
offense
or
its
seriousness,
regardless
of
his
station
in
life
is
nevertheless
unequivocally
entitled
to
his
day
in
court
to
establish
his
innocence
and
with
the
opportunity
to
secure
his
exoneration.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
this
petitioner's
contact
with
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
no
frivolous
skirmish.
this
defendant
was
first
indicted
in
february
of
1964
for
the
grand
jury
of
orange
county
upon
a
bill
of
indictment
charging
him
with
trespass
which
under
north
carolina
law
is
punishable
both
by
a
sentence
and
fine
or
either
one
of
the
two.
pursuant
to
that
bill
of
indictment
of
february
this
defendant
was
brought
to
trial
at
the
special
criminal
session
in
march
of
1964
and
after
a
lengthy
trial
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree
whereupon
this
defendant
was
then
directed
to
appear
in
court
on
the
following
monday.
however,
no
further
proceeding
was
taken
in
march
with
a
crowded
criminal
docket
at
that
time
in
orange
county
for
one
reason
or
another.
the
case
although
it
appeared
once
or
twice
on
the
criminal
docket
there
was
no
further
trial
proceeding
and
then
in
the
spring
of
1965,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
inquired
of
the
state
as
to
what
the
state's
position
in
this
case
would
be
in
the
light
of
the
passage
of
the
1964
federal
civil
rights
act
and
even
more
in
point
this
court's
decision
in
hamm
versus
city
of
rock
hill
applying
that
act
retroactively.
the
solicitor
indicated
as
the
record
shows
that
he
intended
to
take
what
is
known
as
is
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
in
april
of
1965
when
this
case
was
once
again
on
the
docket
of
orange
county
superior
court,
this
petitioner
through
his
counsel
appeared
in
open
court
and
objected
to
that
procedural
point
being
taken
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
entered
in
the
record.
the
court
animated
at
that
time
that
it
agreed
with
the
state
that
it
might
have
the
nolle
prosequi
entered.
then
the
solicitor
having
a
change
of
heart
decided
that
he
wanted
the
case
back
on
the
trial
calendar
right
at
that
moment
in
open
court.
now,
the
next
session
of
the
orange
county
superior
court
then
occurred
in
august
of
1965.
prior
to
that
session
of
court,
it
was
ascertained
that
this
petitioner's
case
was
not
on
the
trial
docket
and
then
an
effort
to
bring
the
matter
to
some
conclusion,
petitioner
filed
a
motion
in
the
orange
county
superior
court
wherein
he
outlined
the
chronology
as
to
the
issuance
of
the
indictment
and
this
prior
context
with
the
court,
and
further
urged
upon
the
court
that
he
have
an
affirmative
defense
to
any
further
attempt
to
prosecute
this
case.
in
that
first
of
all,
this
prosecution
arose
out
of
a
set
of
circumstances
which
constitute
or
which
where
in
the
course
of
a
civil
rights
demonstration
wherein
the
petitioner
assault
service
that
i
placed
which
he
contended
in
this
motion
was
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
he
referred
in
that
motion
to
the
civil
rights
act,
to
his
contention
that
hamm
applied
--
the
hamm
decision
applied
in
his
case
and
in
more
particular
cited
the
superior
court
to
the
case
rendered
by
this
court
in
1965
blow
versus
north
carolina
applying
the
civil
rights
act
under
the
hamm
decision
retroactively
and
pointed
out
in
his
motion
that
the
facts
in
his
case
where
as
to
the
operative
facts
very
similar
to
the
blow
decision.
at
no
point
in
the
record
or
in
this
record
before
the
court
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
ever
seriously
contend
or
ever
contend
at
all
for
that
matter
that
the
statement
in
this
motion
where
incorrect.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
mr.
justice
white
we
got
a
ruling
in
the
sense
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
motion
and
presentation
open
court,
the
state
renewed
its
motion
for
that
an
entry
being
made
of
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
and
that
was
granted.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
your
honor
that
they
never,
the
court
never
attempt
to
go
into
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well
the
motion
act,
the
motion
did
not
immediately
request
the
ruling
on
the
merits
of
that
contention.
what
it
did
request
was
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
be
directed
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
law
and
to
allow
this
defendant
an
opportunity
to
present
those
contentions
in
orderly
procedure
in
the
state
court,
so
what
we
actually
asked
for
a
motion
was
that
the
judge
inquiring
to
why
the
state
of
north
carolina
was
not
willing
to
give
this
defendant
his
day
in
court
in
order
to
urge
this
point.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
your
honor,
this
question
has
engendered
some
discussion
among
the
members
of
the
bars.
it's
my
understanding
of
the
law
of
north
carolina
that
a
motion
to
quash
cannot
be
raise
in
advance
of
the
case
appearing
in
its
regular
order
upon
the
trial
docket.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
and
we
do
not
have
as
my
understanding
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that
the
defendant
on
his
own
motion
can
move
that
the
court
consider
his
case
when
it
is
not
in
regular.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not,
it
is
a
motion
to
request
the
court
to
make
effective
the
petitioner's
right
to
be
heard
in
open
court
in
regular
proceeding.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
let
me
explain
at
this
way
mr.
justice
brennan.
normally,
a
trial
judge
would
not
consider
any
case
on
the
docket.
i
mean
any
case
pending
before
the
court
unless
the
solicitor
has
placed
it
upon
the
docket.
now,
at
the
time
that
we
file
this
motion
our
case
was
pending
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
but
was
not
on
the
trial
docket
and
we
have
been
put
off
about
that.
in
april,
the
indication
by
the
solicitor
in
open
court
being
that
he
was
going
to
proceed
to
trial
this
particular
defendant,
and
all
that
we
were
saying
at
that
time
was
we
are
ready
to
proceed.
we
did
not
ask
or
demand
of
the
court
that
they
had
to
put
this
case
on
for
that
such.
what
we
did
was
the
court
under
its
general
supervisory
jurisdiction
to
in
effect
commit
the
state
to
a
debt
in
a
certain
time
when
they
would
give
us
our
day
in
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
i'll
briefly
explain
that
procedure
in
order
that
the
court
can
see
the
context
in
which
we
operate.
north
carolina
allows
the
solicitor
upon
his
own
initiative
as
to
any
case
pending
in
the
court
to
request
the
court
that
an
entry
be
made
either
of
nolle
prosequi
which
is
short
in
phrase
as
nol
pros
in
our
state
or
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
now,
the
effect
of
that
as
the
court
has
clearly
established
on
our
procedure
is
this,
number
one,
it
is
not
an
acquittal
if
merely
relives
the
defendant
from
having
to
attend
court
from
session
to
session,
and
secondly
releases
him
from
his
bond.
it
in
no
way
is
a
termination
of
the
action
because
the
court
has
explicitly
stated
that
the
state
may
either
proceed
upon
the
original
bill
of
indictment
at
any
time
or
issue
a
new
bill
of
indictment.
now,
the
distinction
and
there
is
but
one
distinction
between
nolle
prosequi
and
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
is
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
now
with
leave
means
--
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way,
under
a
nolle
prosequi
entry
in
order
for
the
solicitor
to
reinstitute
the
proceeding
he
would
have
to
first
apply
to
the
trial
judge
and
get
his
consent
and
a
trial
judge
would
issue
an
order
directing
the
clerk
of
court
to
issue
a
case.
but
then
at
that
point,
they
could
either
proceed
--
under
that
procedure
they
would
proceed
on
the
same
bill
of
indictment
or
if
he
did
not
want
that
instead
of
going
to
the
court
could
request
an
issue,
have
a
presentment
sent
to
the
grand
jury.
now
under
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
and
i
might
say
that
under
our
procedure
that
is
the
customary
entry
rather
than
just
a
limited
nolle
prosequi.
under
nolle
prosequi
with
leave,
the
words
with
leave
mean
in
effect
that
the
court
is
giving
its
consent
in
advance
that
the
solicitor
may
reinstitute
the
proceeding
without
any
further
consent
from
the
court
he
just
would
merely
walk
into
the
clerk's
office
given
the
docket
number
and
ask
to
dictate
his
issue
for
that
defendant.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
absolutely
not.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
your
honor,
there
were
some
concern
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
under
our
statutory
appellate
procedure
that
there
might
be
a
question
raised.
however,
there
was
no
question
raised
either
by
the
state
in
its
brief
nor
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
raised
from
the
brief
here.
so,
i
would
assume
that
the
statue
in
north
carolina
which
says
you
may
appeal
--
only
from
the
final
judgment
is
being
construed
here
to
mean
that
this
action
by
the
solicitor
at
least
as
to
the
facts,
the
defendant
has
filed.
it's
not
final
as
to
the
solicitor
under
north
carolina
procedure
but
it
is
final
as
to
this
petitioner
because
as
the
klopfer
case
opinion
in
the
state
court
indicates
there
is
no
other
procedure
now
available
to
this
petitioner
in
north
carolina
court
by
which
to
compel
the
state
to
allow
him
to
proceed
--
to
this
case.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
your
honor,
in
effect
we
may
be
dealing
here
as
the
question
has
been
raised
originally
with
the
possibility
of
semantics
actually
is
my
understanding
north
carolina
procedure
we
have
no
procedure
equivalent
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
initiating
from
the
defendant
it
would
be
under
the
basis
of
a
motion
to
quash
a
bill
of
indictment.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
we
would
contend
that
is
not
available
under
the
present
legal
status
of
this
case
because
we
have
no
way
to
get
back
on
the
docket
and
even
we
owned,
i
mean
even
there'd
be
a
question
whether
this
case
is
even
pending
in
that
court
now
for
purposes
of
directing
a
motion
to
the
superior
court
judge.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
if
we
could
made
a
motion
to
quash
at
this
point
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right
but
i
think
what
we
anticipate
on
the
north
carolina
procedure
the
reaction
would
have
been
while
this
case
that
is
premature
at
this
point
until
the
solicitor
calls
this
case
on
the
docket.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
your
honor
that's
the
way
i
read
the
--
the
court
was
appearing
on
because
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
says
that
the
defendant
may
not
compel
the
state
to
give
him
his
day
in
court
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
--
even
to
the
limited
basis
of
a
motion
to
quash.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
not
on
those
words,
your
honor
we
in
open
court
on
the
consideration
of
this
motion.
i
think
its
clear
from
the
contents
of
the
motion
in
fact
a
motion
specifically
states
that
to
defend
the
questions
whether
the
state
can
proceed
under
this
bill
of
indictment
and
so
what
we
were
saying
to
the
superior
court
is
that
the
question
or
whether
this
bill
of
indictment
is
valid
would
require
some
type
of
hearing
and
fact
finding
at
probably
preliminary
to
the
actual
trial
by
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
indictment
is
valid
or
not
and
so
in
our
motion
we
were
saying
that
we're
entitled
to
have
our
opportunity
in
court
of
--
to
present
that
motion.
and
as
i
understand
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
we
are
not
entitled
to
fail
the
state
to
give
us
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
there's
no
way
that
the
defendant
may
on
his
own
initiative
raise
that
question
as
i
understand
north
carolina
law.
now,
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
might
not
use
it
defensively
if
10
years
from
today
the
state
of
north
carolina
came
back
and
attempted
to
the
prosecute
that
within
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
state
was
barred
at
that
point
but
my
contention
is
that
this
procedure
of
north
carolina
now
indorse
by
this
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
is
final
as
to
this
petition
is
not
final
as
to
the
state.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
we
would
contend
that
the
under
the
circumstances
in
which
the
state
has
proceeded
particularly
after
we
put
the
state
on
notice
in
our
motion
that
we
had
not
just
a
question
of
contesting
their
evidence
but
the
affirmative
defense
based
upon
a
federal
statue
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
there
being
no
show
here
at
any
point
in
the
record
as
indeed
it's
not
required
under
north
carolina
to
show
those
of
why
there's
any
reason
for
delay
we
contend
that
the
action
of
the
state
here
was
so
arbitrary
and
capricious
as
to
justify
this
court
in
finding
that
the
right
to
speedy
trial
applies
that
it
has
been
unpardonably
violated
here
and
that
further
prosecution
is
barred
in
this
case
because
of
the
deprivation
in
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that
would
be
our
first
and
major
request.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
as
i
recall
our
brief
did
not
stress
the
first
amendment
point
that
it
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
in
this
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
appearing
up
on
page
18
in
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page.
we
point
out
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
where
a
trespass
charge
arises
out
of
this
defendant's
effort
to
change
what
is
a
prevailing
attitude
in
the
community
where
in
this
case
arose
or
at
least
was
so
the
prevailing
attitude
of
the
time
of
this
case
that
the
inevitable
effect
of
the
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
now
is
to
leave
his
future
status
under
this
charge
completely
open
the
question
and
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
quite
often
the
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
procedure
is
used
precisely
for
that
effect
not
necessarily
in
its
more
ordinary
concern
not
the
quail
and
restrict
first
amendment
rights
but
in
effect
you'll
often
have
a
case
where
perhaps
the
state's
witness
is
available
only
greater
expense
to
the
state
and
this
defendant
has
a
reasonably
good
record
and
the
state
decides
that
because
of
this
particular
defendant's
case
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
case
here
that
it's
not
worth
the
expense
to
the
state
in
that
kind
of
case
and
that
just
thread
of
this
prosecution
for
the
next
year
to
hanging
over
its
head
would
probably,
in
other
words
his
brush
with
the
law
even
though
it
doesn't
result
in
conviction
is
sufficient.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right
and
i
think
it
has
a
legitimate
(voice
overlap)
quite
often
has
legitimate
years
and
we
do
not
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
we
do
not
cite
at
this
procedure
per
se.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
let
me
say,
i
would
concede
it's
appropriate
only
if
the
defendant
in
effect
consents
to
it.
rather
consents
and
does
not
object
to
the
entry
of
the
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
in
other
words,
quite
often
the
defendant
is
just
as
delight
as
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
in
fact,
on
our
proceeding
in
the
superior
court
of
orange
county,
we
have
a
little
difficulty
with
the
superior
court
judge
and
taking
--
in
trying
to
take
me
seriously
that
i
was
opposing
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so
from
--
i'll
say
under
normal
practice
99%
of
the
time
in
ordinary
criminal
case
is
it
is.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
not
in
a
sensible
note,
the
very
assertion
as
was
used
here
and
i
might
say
your
honor
this
case
was
hardly
contested
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
violation
in
north
carolina
trespass
law,
it
took
approximately
three
days
to
come
out.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
i
think
for
this
i
think
the
objection
that
we
contend
for
applied
equally
whether
it's
with
or
without
leave
because
we
contend
that
this
procedure
transgresses
vital
interest
of
a
criminal
defendant
whether
it's
with
or
without
leave
if
the
state
construes
that
it
has
giving
the
absolute
and
final
and
complete
authority
to
for
ever
denying
this
day
in
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right
and
it's
as
far
as
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
that's
the
crucial
point
in
the
case
and
the
reason
that
that
puts
the
weight
and
burden
upon
the
defendant
and
that
is
that
the
statute
to
limitations
which
is
only
two
years
in
a
misdemeanor
case
does
not
ran
during
dependency
of
the
nolle
prosequi
entry.
now,
if
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
either
one.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
either
one
told
the
statute
of
limitations.
now,
if
that
characteristic
of
the
nolle
prosequi
procedure
was
not
present
then
we
would
not
be
here
today
because
the
statute
of
limitations
would
come
in
and
terminate.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
i
contend
that
all
cases
disposed
of
by
the
nolle
prosequi
procedure
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant
(voice
overlap)
urge
in
trial
does
transgress
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that
he
has
to
offer
any
burden
as
upon
him.
in
terms
of
reality
it
may
be
and
i
would
suppose
the
case
where
it's
quite
conclusive
that
he's
going
to
be
found
guilty
but
i
don't
think
that
would
be
in
anyway
irrelevant
consideration
by
the
trial
court.
i
think
he
is
entitled.
however,
misguided
and
overly
optimistic
he
may
be,
he's
entitled
to
remove
from
himself
the
personal
anxiety
and
apprehension
of
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
to
try
to
escape
the
quite
often
and
the
serious
impact
which
a
criminal
charge
pending
criminal
charge
would
have
offend
his
reputation
in
standing
in
the
community.
and
likewise
to
take
steps
to
avoid
the
delay
impairing
his
opportunity
to
present
such
defenses
he
may
have
in
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
in
the
sentence
immediately
before
that
mr.
justice
brennan
was
first
urged
that
under
these
circumstances
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
of
the
state
justifies
barring
it
as
on
the
grounds
of
the
very
basic
constitutional
right
but
at
the
very
least
we're
entitled
to
what
we
sold
in
our
original
motion
and
that
is
the
opportunity
to
present
our
defense
on
its
merits
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
actually
north
carolina's
nolle
prosequi
procedure
is
not
grounded
on
a
statute
as
i
understand
that's
a
carryover
from
the
procedural
device
under
the
same
name
of
common
law.
at
least
our
courts
cites
no
statute
and
we
have
one
or
two
--
have
one
statute
in
particular
that
says
that
where
a
defendant
has
been
indicted
and
has
not
been
apprehended
within
two
terms
of
court
that
the
clerk
of
court
may
have
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
entered
and
i
think
that
is
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
administrative
convenience
in
order
to
get
it
off
the
docket
because
the
defendant
may
never
admit
it.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
my
understanding
that
some
states
do
not
go
with
the
position
that
north
carolina
has
of
the
nolle
prosequi
statute,
i'm
afraid
to
say
it
does
told
the
statute.
the
only
use
that
has
ever
been
suggested
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
to
use
this
procedure
is
in
a
case
where
the
state
does
not
feel
it
has
sufficient
evidence
to
proceed
and
secure
a
conviction
but
even
that
consideration
if
it
were
justifiable
a
moment
eventually
the
total
of
time
cuts
that
off
because
it's
equally
cogent
and
likely
that
there
is
no
such
evidence
to
ever
be
obtained
and
if
there
is
none
this
defendant
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
this
case
of
state
versus
williams
that's
cited
in
the
brief.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
state
versus
williams.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
actually,
he
was
arrested
in
the
presence
of
the
deputy
sheriff
on
the
night
of
january
3rd,
the
night
of
the
alleged
occurrence.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
1964.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
and
then
it
went
into
recorder's
court
and
the
state
did
not
want
to
try
the
case
in
recorder's
court
and
went
up
in
to
the
superior
court
and
on
motion
of
the
state
in
normal
procedure
there
is
to
seek
an
indictment.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
to
this
offense,
the
statute
limitations
would
be
two
years.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
we
have
no
statute
on
felonies
so
if
these
were
felony
charge
the
effect
that
it
told
the
statute
wouldn't
make
any
difference
but
it
would
still
involve
the
basic
considerations
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
except
for
the
nolle
prosequi
we
would
have
either
have
our
hearing
in
court.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right,
assume
nothing
had
happen
this
would've
ran.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
yes
that
was
made
within
one
month.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
well,
it
was
actually
told
by
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
on
the
day
after
the
offense
and
then
of
course
the
warrant
comes
up
to
a
point
then
he's
bound
over
the
bill
of
indictment
fixed
it
up
at
that
point.
so,
as
of
this
moment
utmost
the
not
more
than
one
day
of
the
two
years
has
actually
ran
as
of
this
point.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
and
yet
come
february
we
will
look
--
at
three
years
actually
--
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
now
that
the
point
is
now
that
it's
told
forever
and
that
therefore
there
is
as
to
this
defendant
this
procedure
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
state
of
north
carolina
says
that
that
there
is
no
relief
available
to
compel
a
trial
that
explicitly
states
we
may
not
compel
trial
and
yet
it
is
not
conclusive
on
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
reason
it's
not
conclusive
as
a
termination
of
this
case
is
that
it
owes
the
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor
and
even
as
i
read
north
carolina
nolle
prosequi
procedure
as
long
is
there
is
a
nolle
prosequi
for
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
entry
in
a
case
brought
within
the
original
statute
of
limitations
if
they
want
to
they
can
go
back
and
get
a
new
bill
of
indictment
and
proceed
upon
that.
mr.
wade
h.
penny,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
the
bill
is
still
outstanding
under
our
nolle
prosequi
procedure.
thank
you.
