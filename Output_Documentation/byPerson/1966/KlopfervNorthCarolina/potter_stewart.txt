if
there's
no

of
the

if
it
requires
follow
for
a
10
years
say
under

motion
there's
no

tearing

on

justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
did
you
try
to
make
such
a
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
failure
that
--
failure
to
prosecute,
the
prosecution
doesn't
want
to
go
forward.
there's
no
way
of
defendant
getting
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
operates
on
this
kind
of
an
informal
probationary
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

accepted
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

before
any
finding
of
guilt.
i
don't
know
how
legitimate
that
is
to
give
the
power
unbridle
power
to
a
prosecutor
to
put
somebody
on
probation
--
well,
it's
been
charged
of
that
offense
but
never
found
guilty
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
oh
usually
he's
very
happy
now.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
in
fact
i
get
the
impression
right
there,
tell
me
if
it's
wrong
that
in
fact
isn't
it
of
the
practical
matter
not
of
the
equivalent
of
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
statute
only
(voice
overlap)
what
has
to
be
done
within
the
statutory
limitation
period
if
the
indictment
or
information
has
to
be
filed
the
charges
to
be
made.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
the
statute
limitation
is
and
a
charge
was
made
here
within
the
two
years.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
other
words,
if
there
have
been
nothing
--
if
this
had
never
happened
if
there
have
been
no
nolle
prosequi
at
all
it
would've
been
no
statute
of
limitations
problem
there,
you
might've
have
a
very
good
claim
under
your
right
to
a
speedy
trial
but
certainly
the
statute
limitations
are
satisfied
when
the
charge
was
made
and
within
the
two
years,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
vanore,
are
you
telling
us
that
there
is
no
such
thing
in
your
state
as
the
power
to
dismiss
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
there
in
no
such
thing
as
that?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
trial
judge,
does
he
have
power
to
dismiss
an
indictment
without
a
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
dismissal,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
equivalent.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
isn't
the
dismissal.
this
thing
is
actually
hanging
over
this
petitioner's
head
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
probably
have
a
very
good
defense
in
terms
of
forgetting
on
hamm
and
(inaudible)
in
terms
of
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
but
nonetheless
he
would
have
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
hanging
over
his
head,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
apparently,
the
person
can
go
hands
without
any
bond
or
anything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
said
there
was
no
such
thing.
you
said
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
north
carolina.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
you
to
say
and
you
correct
me
i
obviously
and
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
said
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
an
indictment
and
no
power
because
of
the
prosecutor
to
dismiss
an
indictment
and
no
power
of
the
trial
judge
to
dismiss
the
case
after
the
grand
jury
brought
in
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
would
be
what,
a
directive
acquittal?
justice
potter
stewart
a
directive
verdict
for
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
after
a
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
