do
you
have
to
know
how
many
fellow
states
there
are
that
have
if
any
that
have
statutes
exactly
like
north
carolina?
chief

i
take
it
for
in
some
states
where
they
do
have
the
nolle
prosequi
that
when
it's
nolle
prosequi
the
action
is
terminated
then
if
they
want
to
proceed
to
further
they
have
to
re-indict
it
within
the
statute
of

but
suppose
10
years
from
now
the
prosecuting
attorney
wanted
to
try
this
man.
i
assume
from
what
has
been
said
here
that
he
can
put
into
trial
without
asking
the
court's
consent
or
anyone
else,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
would
that
date
arrived
when
he
would
have
a
good
trial
--
have
a
good
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
question
i
asked
you
is
about
10
years,
how
about
eight
years
or
seven
or
six
or
five?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
how
long
would
he
have
to
wait
before
he
could
--
to
get
such
a
relief
if
the
prosecutor
decided
that
he
wanted
said
was
five
years
that
he
want
or
in
five
years
he
want
to
try
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
be
done
by
a
pretrial
motion
or
must
the
jury
be
drawn
before
or
he
can
make
such
a
motion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
if
he
didn't
want
to
be
tried
because
of
the
lifetime
and
he
move
for
dismissal
on
the
grounds
of
not
getting
a
speedy
trial
and
the
judge
said,
alright,
that's
true
then
the
only
acquittal
he
would
have
would
be
because
he
didn't
give
a
speedy
trial,
he
wouldn't
have
an
adjudication
on
the
facts,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
happened
to
know
how
many
other
states
if
then
he
have
the
same
procedure
you
have?
chief

and

the
brief
(voice

--
chief
justice

warren
--
that
21
you
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
take
the
position
that
we
should
decide
this
case
on
its
peculiar
facts,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
why
in
both
of
your
answer
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
also
in
your
brief
on
the
merits
that
no
such
concession
as
you
now
make
was
made
here
and
both
of
those
dockets
unless
you
ask
the
court
to
deny
this
petition
any
relief.
now,
why
do
you
come
to
us
in
that
posture?
