mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
crux
of
the
case
is
whether
of
not
the
defendant
here
can
compel
the
state
to
prosecute.
in
this
respect,
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
north
carolina
under
the
north
carolina
procedure
once
the
bill
of
indictment
is
returned
as
a
true
bill
by
the
grand
jury
the
solicitor
as
an
alternative
to
bringing
the
defendant
to
a
trial
can
only
do
one
of
two
things.
he
nolle
prosequi
the
case
or
he
can
request
the
court
to
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
this
is
the
only
way
that
the
indictment
or
that
the
question
can
be
resolved
and
in
this
particular
aspect
during
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
did
hand
down
the
hamm
decision
involving
civil
rights
prosecution
as
trespasses
and
so
forth.
the
solicitor
obviously
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
could
not
prosecute
the
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
once
a
bill
of
indictment
is
drawn
and
return
as
a
true
bill
by
the
grand
jury
the
only
alternative
that
the
solicitor
has
is
to
nolle
prosequi
or
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
as
far
as
the
--
a
motion
to
quash
as
you
brought
up
before
and
asking
mr.
penny
about
that.
that
would
be
for
procedural
defects
only
and
not
for
defects
on
the
merits
so
to
speak
due
to
the
fact
that
as
this
court
did
in
hamm
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
is
my
understanding
that
you
would
have
to
go
to
a
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
the
only
alternative
would
have
been
for
the
solicitor
to
bring
the
case
to
trial
and
then
request
the
court
to
remove
the
juror
without
cause
and
therefore
if
the
state
ever
tried
to
prosecute
the
individual
again,
it
would
be
a
question
of
double
jeopardy
there.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct
you
honor.
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
procedural
aspects
in
north
carolina
as
far
as
removing
once
an
indictment
has
been
involved.
it
is
interesting
note,
i
was
unable
to
find
a
case
where
a
defendant
has
raised
the
same
defense
that
the
defendant
here
is
right.
now,
there
are
thousands
of
nolle
prosequi
and
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
as
you
mentioned
before
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
this
is
the
equivalent
of
a
dismissal.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
theoretically,
i
must
agree
with
you
in
10
years
from
now.
this
case
could
be
brought
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
when
you
say
hanging
over
his
head,
the
petitioner
has
said
that
this
impedes
his
right
to
take
trips
to
europe
and
so
forth.
i
don't
see
where
that
is
true
though
i
don't
of
any
case
where
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
has
impeded
an
individual
from
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
our
court
has
so
ruled
in
coffey
that
the
effect
of
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
is
to
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
as
far
as
the
felony
is
concerned
mr.
justice
fortas
there
is
no
statue
of
limitations
on
the
felony
but
actually
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
it
is
used
in
the
felony
case
also.
in
answer
to
your
question
yes,
he
would
have
to
disclose
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
in
other
words,
if
a
person
is
accused
of
murder
or
murdering
someone
in
1940
the
state
can
indict
him
for
that
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
would
be
a
felony
in
north
carolina
and
there
would
be
no
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
only
statute
of
limitation
that
is
applicable
is
in
the
case
of
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
of
course
mr.
chief
justice
the
state
contends
that
the
defendant
would
certainly
have
a
good
defense.
in
fact,
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
been
denied
a
speedy
trial.
i
think
if
the
question
if
the
solicitor
now,
try
to
bring
this
particular
defendant
to
trial
that
certainly
our
court
in
north
carolina
would
go
along
with
the
defense
of
the
fact
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
speedy
trial
but
i
can't
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
this
would
only
arise
when
and
if
the
prosecutor
elected
to
prosecute
the
defendant
for
the
case
which
with
which
he
is
charged.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
or
50
years
as
far
as
that's
concerned
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
as
soon
as
prosecutor
put
the
case
on
the
trial
docket,
the
defendant
could
come
in
and
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
grounds
that
he
was
denied
his
constitutional
right
to
speedy
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
on
this
constitutional
right
here
as
far
as
it
would
be
a
motion
on
the
merits
because
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
you
did
not
misunderstand
me.what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
once
the
case
was
brought
to
trial
that
the
defendant
--
this
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
that
defendant
would
have
to
raise
in
stating
that
he
was
denied
his
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
a
directive
verdict
yes,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
the
court
would
direct
the
verdict
to
the
juror.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
after
a
trial.
now,
in
this
respect,
we
do
not
have
a
trial.
once
an
indictment
is
wrong
the
only
way
it
can
be
dismiss
is
by
nolle
prosequi
or
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
that
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say
other
than
bringing
him
actually
to
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i
suggested
that
would
be
a
way
that
this
could
have
been
done.
no.
mr.
judge
would
direct
the
verdict.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
one
way
to
do
it
withdraw
a
juror
without
reason
and
of
course
you
can
never
be
tried
again
because
it
would
be
double
jeopardy.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
jury
must
make
be
drawn.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
it
would
start
out
as
an
adjudication
on
the
facts
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
would
be
the
only
way
this
case
could
be
finally
terminated
and
that
would
be
for
the
solicitor
to
bring
the
case
and
put
it
on
the
trial
docket
for
trial
by
a
jury.
and
during
the
process
of
the
trial,
this
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
defendant
has
not
been
afforded
of
right,
or
his
right
his
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
because
the
state
has
let
us
say
waited
three
years
without
a
good
reason
before
trying
this
individual.
as
far
as
the
state
of
north
carolina's
position
is,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial
if
there
is
to
be
a
trial.
now,
as
far
as
the
question
concerning
itself
with
the
fact
that
this
is
hanging
over
his
head
indefinitely
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
practically
speaking
the
state
takes
the
position
that
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
is
in
effect
a
dismissal.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
would
have
to
answer
that
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
there
are
none
that
have
exactly
the
same
procedure.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
23
of
the
amicus
jury
our
brief
where
that
is
set
out
that
the
13
states
have
placed
sole
discretion
of
nolle
prosequi
within
the
court,
they
do
set
out
some
of
the
statutes
that
other
states
have
concerning
of
--
i
was
unable
to
find
any
directly
similar
to
north
carolina's
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
the
state
would
accept
it
but
i
would
certainly
think
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
north
carolina
supreme
court
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
that
would
certainly
be
a
good
defense
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
that
is
the
crux
of
the
matter.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
cannot
give
any
reasons
for
why
the
state
does
that.
i
can
simply
say
this
that
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
has
denied
the
right
due
to
the
fact
that
the
procedure
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
was
just
like
to
suggest
one
thing
if
your
honor
pleases
as
mr.
penny
mentioned
to
the
court,
it
would
seem
that
where
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
is
requested
by
the
solicitor
and
the
is
no
objection
by
the
defendant
that
certainly
would
be
proper
as
in
this
case
where
the
defendant
has
objected
quite
candidly
perhaps
this
court
should
allow
some
redress
to
that.
i
do
believe
that
under
the
facts
of
this
court
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well
i
think
you
should
decide
this
on
its
peculiar
facts
in
that
the
defendant
objective
strenuously
to
the
entry
of
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
by
the
solicitor.
the
reason
i
say
this
it's
because
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
this
is
actually
an
effect
a
dismissal
and
i
have
never
known
of
the
defendant
in
north
carolina
that
has
complain
when
the
solicitor
has
taken
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
this
is
the
first
case
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
any
other
jurisdiction
that
this
question
has
ever
been
raised.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
where
an
objection
is
made
and
where
the
state
does
not
set
forth
good
reason
such
as
he
needs
more
time
to
get
more
evidence
against
the
individual
and
they
have
good
reason
for
requesting
a
continuation
yes
if
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
did
not
occur.
the
solicitor
gave
no
reason
for
in
this
particular
case.
well,
i
would
might
suggest
that
the
court
remand
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
with
direction
that
the
state
either
try
this
man
within
a
reasonable
time
or
that
the
supreme
court
itself
quash
the
indictment.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
on
what
ground
do
they
quash
the
indictment?
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i
would
say
this
that
under
the
peculiar
procedure
in
north
carolina
that
it
is
unconstitutional
not
to
allow
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
it
would
have
to
come
under
the
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no
it
has
not.
it
is
never
been
applied
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
that
is
the
only
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
a
full
problem
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
rather
than
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
never
had
the
chance
to
exonerate
himself
as
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
before
that
if
in
10
years
he
applied
for
job
he
would
have
to
say
that
he
is
under
indictment
in
north
carolina.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
where
the
defendant
objects
to
the
states
taking
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
and
where
the
solicitor
has
not
stated
sufficient
reasons
for
requesting
an
extension
of
time
in
order
to
reinstate
for
lack
of
evidence.
i
would
like
--
yes,
very
much.
i
would
like
to
limit
it
to
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
peculiar
fact
of
this
case
is
that
this
defendant
wanted
to
be
tried.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
preferred
quite
frankly
not
to
put
there
in
the
brief
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
if
any
admission
or
a
vow
was
made
that
it
would
be
made
orally
because
i
was
not
sure
that
particular
time
that
i
in
my
own
part
it
was
error.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
if
there
is
to
be
a
trial
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
that
that
goes
as
far
as
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
--
all
of
the
cases
that
have
come
up
to
this
court
on
the
question
of
speedy
trial
have
a
reason
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
what
the
state
has
not
elected
to
prosecute
a
man
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
they
haven't
given
him
the
benefit
of
any
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
as
far
as
all
of
the
cases
that
come
up
under
the
sixth
amendment
right
arise
where
the
state
has
elected
prosecute
and
the
defense
is
raised
of
speedy
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
must
try
him
or
whether
or
not
this
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
suffices.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
i
would
mr.
justice
harlan
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
i
am
representative
of
the
attorney
general
ralph
on
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case
as
i
have
mentioned
before
where
the
defendant
raises
an
objection,
i
would
not
like
to
see
the
whole
process
of
procedure
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
definitely
not.
i've
already
discussed
that
point
with
my
(inaudible).
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
crux
of
the
case
is
whether
of
not
the
defendant
here
can
compel
the
state
to
prosecute.
in
this
respect,
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
north
carolina
under
the
north
carolina
procedure
once
the
bill
of
indictment
is
returned
as
a
true
bill
by
the
grand
jury
the
solicitor
as
an
alternative
to
bringing
the
defendant
to
a
trial
can
only
do
one
of
two
things.
he
nolle
prosequi
the
case
or
he
can
request
the
court
to
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
this
is
the
only
way
that
the
indictment
or
that
the
question
can
be
resolved
and
in
this
particular
aspect
during
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
did
hand
down
the
hamm
decision
involving
civil
rights
prosecution
as
trespasses
and
so
forth.
the
solicitor
obviously
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
could
not
prosecute
the
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
once
a
bill
of
indictment
is
drawn
and
return
as
a
true
bill
by
the
grand
jury
the
only
alternative
that
the
solicitor
has
is
to
nolle
prosequi
or
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
as
far
as
the
--
a
motion
to
quash
as
you
brought
up
before
and
asking
mr.
penny
about
that.
that
would
be
for
procedural
defects
only
and
not
for
defects
on
the
merits
so
to
speak
due
to
the
fact
that
as
this
court
did
in
hamm
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
is
my
understanding
that
you
would
have
to
go
to
a
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
the
only
alternative
would
have
been
for
the
solicitor
to
bring
the
case
to
trial
and
then
request
the
court
to
remove
the
juror
without
cause
and
therefore
if
the
state
ever
tried
to
prosecute
the
individual
again,
it
would
be
a
question
of
double
jeopardy
there.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct
you
honor.
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
procedural
aspects
in
north
carolina
as
far
as
removing
once
an
indictment
has
been
involved.
it
is
interesting
note,
i
was
unable
to
find
a
case
where
a
defendant
has
raised
the
same
defense
that
the
defendant
here
is
right.
now,
there
are
thousands
of
nolle
prosequi
and
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
as
you
mentioned
before
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
this
is
the
equivalent
of
a
dismissal.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
theoretically,
i
must
agree
with
you
in
10
years
from
now.
this
case
could
be
brought
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
when
you
say
hanging
over
his
head,
the
petitioner
has
said
that
this
impedes
his
right
to
take
trips
to
europe
and
so
forth.
i
don't
see
where
that
is
true
though
i
don't
of
any
case
where
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
has
impeded
an
individual
from
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
our
court
has
so
ruled
in
coffey
that
the
effect
of
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
is
to
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
as
far
as
the
felony
is
concerned
mr.
justice
fortas
there
is
no
statue
of
limitations
on
the
felony
but
actually
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
it
is
used
in
the
felony
case
also.
in
answer
to
your
question
yes,
he
would
have
to
disclose
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
in
other
words,
if
a
person
is
accused
of
murder
or
murdering
someone
in
1940
the
state
can
indict
him
for
that
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
would
be
a
felony
in
north
carolina
and
there
would
be
no
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
only
statute
of
limitation
that
is
applicable
is
in
the
case
of
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
of
course
mr.
chief
justice
the
state
contends
that
the
defendant
would
certainly
have
a
good
defense.
in
fact,
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
been
denied
a
speedy
trial.
i
think
if
the
question
if
the
solicitor
now,
try
to
bring
this
particular
defendant
to
trial
that
certainly
our
court
in
north
carolina
would
go
along
with
the
defense
of
the
fact
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
speedy
trial
but
i
can't
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
this
would
only
arise
when
and
if
the
prosecutor
elected
to
prosecute
the
defendant
for
the
case
which
with
which
he
is
charged.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
or
50
years
as
far
as
that's
concerned
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
as
soon
as
prosecutor
put
the
case
on
the
trial
docket,
the
defendant
could
come
in
and
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
grounds
that
he
was
denied
his
constitutional
right
to
speedy
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
on
this
constitutional
right
here
as
far
as
it
would
be
a
motion
on
the
merits
because
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
you
did
not
misunderstand
me.what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
once
the
case
was
brought
to
trial
that
the
defendant
--
this
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
that
defendant
would
have
to
raise
in
stating
that
he
was
denied
his
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
a
directive
verdict
yes,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
the
court
would
direct
the
verdict
to
the
juror.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
after
a
trial.
now,
in
this
respect,
we
do
not
have
a
trial.
once
an
indictment
is
wrong
the
only
way
it
can
be
dismiss
is
by
nolle
prosequi
or
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
that
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say
other
than
bringing
him
actually
to
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i
suggested
that
would
be
a
way
that
this
could
have
been
done.
no.
mr.
judge
would
direct
the
verdict.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
one
way
to
do
it
withdraw
a
juror
without
reason
and
of
course
you
can
never
be
tried
again
because
it
would
be
double
jeopardy.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
jury
must
make
be
drawn.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
it
would
start
out
as
an
adjudication
on
the
facts
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
would
be
the
only
way
this
case
could
be
finally
terminated
and
that
would
be
for
the
solicitor
to
bring
the
case
and
put
it
on
the
trial
docket
for
trial
by
a
jury.
and
during
the
process
of
the
trial,
this
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
defendant
has
not
been
afforded
of
right,
or
his
right
his
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
because
the
state
has
let
us
say
waited
three
years
without
a
good
reason
before
trying
this
individual.
as
far
as
the
state
of
north
carolina's
position
is,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial
if
there
is
to
be
a
trial.
now,
as
far
as
the
question
concerning
itself
with
the
fact
that
this
is
hanging
over
his
head
indefinitely
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
practically
speaking
the
state
takes
the
position
that
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
is
in
effect
a
dismissal.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
would
have
to
answer
that
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
there
are
none
that
have
exactly
the
same
procedure.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
23
of
the
amicus
jury
our
brief
where
that
is
set
out
that
the
13
states
have
placed
sole
discretion
of
nolle
prosequi
within
the
court,
they
do
set
out
some
of
the
statutes
that
other
states
have
concerning
of
--
i
was
unable
to
find
any
directly
similar
to
north
carolina's
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
the
state
would
accept
it
but
i
would
certainly
think
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
north
carolina
supreme
court
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
that
would
certainly
be
a
good
defense
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
that
is
the
crux
of
the
matter.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
cannot
give
any
reasons
for
why
the
state
does
that.
i
can
simply
say
this
that
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
has
denied
the
right
due
to
the
fact
that
the
procedure
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
was
just
like
to
suggest
one
thing
if
your
honor
pleases
as
mr.
penny
mentioned
to
the
court,
it
would
seem
that
where
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
is
requested
by
the
solicitor
and
the
is
no
objection
by
the
defendant
that
certainly
would
be
proper
as
in
this
case
where
the
defendant
has
objected
quite
candidly
perhaps
this
court
should
allow
some
redress
to
that.
i
do
believe
that
under
the
facts
of
this
court
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well
i
think
you
should
decide
this
on
its
peculiar
facts
in
that
the
defendant
objective
strenuously
to
the
entry
of
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
by
the
solicitor.
the
reason
i
say
this
it's
because
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
this
is
actually
an
effect
a
dismissal
and
i
have
never
known
of
the
defendant
in
north
carolina
that
has
complain
when
the
solicitor
has
taken
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave.
this
is
the
first
case
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
any
other
jurisdiction
that
this
question
has
ever
been
raised.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
where
an
objection
is
made
and
where
the
state
does
not
set
forth
good
reason
such
as
he
needs
more
time
to
get
more
evidence
against
the
individual
and
they
have
good
reason
for
requesting
a
continuation
yes
if
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
did
not
occur.
the
solicitor
gave
no
reason
for
in
this
particular
case.
well,
i
would
might
suggest
that
the
court
remand
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
with
direction
that
the
state
either
try
this
man
within
a
reasonable
time
or
that
the
supreme
court
itself
quash
the
indictment.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
on
what
ground
do
they
quash
the
indictment?
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i
would
say
this
that
under
the
peculiar
procedure
in
north
carolina
that
it
is
unconstitutional
not
to
allow
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
it
would
have
to
come
under
the
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no
it
has
not.
it
is
never
been
applied
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
that
is
the
only
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
a
full
problem
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
rather
than
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
never
had
the
chance
to
exonerate
himself
as
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
before
that
if
in
10
years
he
applied
for
job
he
would
have
to
say
that
he
is
under
indictment
in
north
carolina.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
where
the
defendant
objects
to
the
states
taking
a
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
and
where
the
solicitor
has
not
stated
sufficient
reasons
for
requesting
an
extension
of
time
in
order
to
reinstate
for
lack
of
evidence.
i
would
like
--
yes,
very
much.
i
would
like
to
limit
it
to
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
peculiar
fact
of
this
case
is
that
this
defendant
wanted
to
be
tried.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
preferred
quite
frankly
not
to
put
there
in
the
brief
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
if
any
admission
or
a
vow
was
made
that
it
would
be
made
orally
because
i
was
not
sure
that
particular
time
that
i
in
my
own
part
it
was
error.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
if
there
is
to
be
a
trial
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
that
that
goes
as
far
as
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
--
all
of
the
cases
that
have
come
up
to
this
court
on
the
question
of
speedy
trial
have
a
reason
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
what
the
state
has
not
elected
to
prosecute
a
man
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
they
haven't
given
him
the
benefit
of
any
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
as
far
as
all
of
the
cases
that
come
up
under
the
sixth
amendment
right
arise
where
the
state
has
elected
prosecute
and
the
defense
is
raised
of
speedy
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
must
try
him
or
whether
or
not
this
nolle
prosequi
with
leave
suffices.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
i
would
mr.
justice
harlan
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
i
am
representative
of
the
attorney
general
ralph
on
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case
as
i
have
mentioned
before
where
the
defendant
raises
an
objection,
i
would
not
like
to
see
the
whole
process
of
procedure
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
definitely
not.
i've
already
discussed
that
point
with
my
(inaudible).
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
thank
you.
