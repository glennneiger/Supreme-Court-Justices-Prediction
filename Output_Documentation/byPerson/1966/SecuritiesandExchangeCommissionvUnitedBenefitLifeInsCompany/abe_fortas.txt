justice
abe
fortas
general,
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
before
you
sit
down,
i
suppose
that
under
investment
company
act,
there
are
some
things
that
the
company
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
than
it
would
be
permitted
to
do
under
the
insurance
regulatory
schemes
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
state.
and
if
that
--
if
that
is
so,
if
that
is
so,
and
i
suppose
that
what
we're
faced
with
is
a
problem
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
says
that
no
act
of
congress
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
shall
be
construed
to
invalidate,
impair,
or
supersede
an
insurance
law
of
the
state
unless
the
law
of
congress
says
specifically
in
terms
of
insurance.
well,
this
isn't.
justice
abe
fortas
the
investment
company
act
is
not.
now,
the
question
is
whether
you
fall
within
this
prohibition
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
when
you
say
that
a
contract
of
this
sort
which
has
dual
aspects,
clearly
as
dual
aspects,
insurance
and
insurance
aspect
is
subject
to
sec
regulation
particularly
when
you
take
into
account
the
hypothesis
in
a
way
that
there
are
some
things
they
could
not
do
under
the
investment
company
act
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
do
under
the
state
insurance
acts.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you've
got
two
approaches
there.
when
--
i
suppose
--
an
approach
is
saying
this
is
either
insurance
or
its
investment.
the
other
approach
is
to
say
that
this
has
aspects
of
both
and
to
reach
a
conclusion
if
it's
possible
that
the
--
it's
subject
to
dual
regulation.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you
could
do
--
and
analytically,
you
could
proceed
down
either
avenue,
but
if
you
proceeded
down
the
latter
you
might
possibly
run
into
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
justice
abe
fortas
in
how
many
states
does
this
company
qualified
as
an
insurance
company?
justice
abe
fortas
had
there
been
any
rulings
by
insurance
--
by
state
insurance
commissions
as
to
whether
this
--
these
contracts
are
contracts
of
insurance?
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
some
states
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
some
states
who
disapprove
it?
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
some
states
that
don't
allow
you
to
sell
it
as
contract
of
insurance?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there's
no
--
no
compilation
of
that
state
situation
in
your
brief,
is
there?
