mr.
solicitor
general,
is
there
a
--
or
is
there
not
a
legislation
before
congress
on
this
matter
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
touch
this
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
mccauley.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
gather
the
purchaser
of
one
of
these
may
look
to
some
accumulated
values
beyond
this
minimum
guarantee,
may
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
that
state
regulation
would
deal
only
with
the
reserves
necessary
to
protect
the
guarantee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
what,
what
state
makes
provision
for
any
protection
of
the
purchaser?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
first
of
those
who
accumulated
values
incidentally
if
--
if
there
isn't
a
state
insurance
protection
because
they're
not
necessary
to
secure
reserves
to
take
care
of
the
minimum.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
make
it
up
they're
not
regulated,
if
you
prevail,
then
there
would
be
any
regulation
of
them
at
all,
any
protection
for
the
purchaser
of
the
accumulated
value.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
well
what
would
that
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
state
insurance
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

have
they
--
is
that
--

that
from

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
--
i
take
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
question
about
that
fund
that's
subject
to
state
regulations,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
subject
and
i
--
i
would
expect
the
state
insurance
authorities
would
keep
putting
vigilant
eye
allotted
to
reserves
and
everything
else.
but
now
there's
a
--
the
accumulated
value
that
were
speaking
of
is
in
a
separate
fund,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
separate
account?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
--
and
you're
telling
me
the
state
insurance
authorities
are
watchful
of
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
kind
of
controls
on
the
investments
on
that
separate
fund
do
the
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
is
the
same
limitations
on

on
what
the
investments
may
include?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
uniformity
of
