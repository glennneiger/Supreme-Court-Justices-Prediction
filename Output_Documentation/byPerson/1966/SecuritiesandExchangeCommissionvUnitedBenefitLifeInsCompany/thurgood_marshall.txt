mr.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case
united
of
omaha
sells
to
the
public
or
had
been
selling
to
the
public
what
it
called
a
flexible
fund
annuity
under
which
the
value
of
the
purchaser's
ultimate
interest
depended
in
significant
part
upon
the
value
of
a
regular
portfolio
of
securities,
largely
common
stocks
and
in
which
the
respondent
manages.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
believing
the
flexible
fund
annuity
to
be
subject
to
the
federal
securities
act
sought
to
enjoin
the
respondents
from
offering
these
securities
and
selling
it
out
complying
with
the
registration
provisions
of
both
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
1940
act.
to
remember,
both
of
these
statutes
contained
exemptions
for
“insurance”
and
so
the
question
in
this
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
whether
the
flexible
fund
is
within
those
insurance
exemptions
in
both
the
1933
and
the
1940
acts.
mr.
marshall
not
that
i
know
of.
it's
about
the
mutual
companies
in
general.
mr.
marshall
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
marshall
no
sir,
no
sir.
the
district
court
ruled
that
this
flexible
fund
was
an
insurance
product
within
the
exemptions
and
it
therefore
declined
the
grant
the
requested
relief
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
viewing
the
fund
is
significantly
different
from
the
variable
annuity
contract
which
this
court
held
to
be
subject
to
the
federal
securities
law
in
the
valic
case.
and
here
we
urged
that
the
flexible
fund
contract
like
the
contract
in
valic,
is
a
kind
of
interest
extended
to
be
--
intended
to
be
regulated
by
the
securities
act.
and
conversely,
that
like
the
contract
which
was
in
valic,
it
is
not
the
kind
of
product
intended
to
be
exempted
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
insurance
products.
the
nature
of
the
flexible
fund
contract
like
the
one
in
valic
requires
that
it's
purchasers
be
given
the
investment
protection
that
congress
designed
for
those
who
are
offered
in
sole
participation
and
a
pool
of
equity
securities
and
interests
that
fluctuates
in
accordance
with
the
value
of
a
portfolio
securities
managed
by
some
other
people.
now
under
the
flexible
fund,
the
purchaser
makes
fixed
periodic
payments
until
the
pre-selected
maturity
date,
usually
some
20
or
30
years
from
now.
after
expenses
are
deducted
from
these
premiums
or
anything
from
50%
in
the
first
year
to
nine
and
a
half
for
the
next
nine
years,
and
5%
thereafter,
the
balance
of
the
net
premiums
are
put
into
a
separate
fund
by
the
respondent.
this
fund
is
reduced
each
month
by
an
amount
totaling
1%
per
year
and
by
an
allowance
for
the
respondent's
taxes.
the
remainder
is
invested
in
a
portfolio
of
securities
as
i
mentioned
before
largely
common
stock
securities,
certainly
equities.
during
the
pay-in
period,
the
period
prior
to
the
selected
maturity
date,
the
purchaser
may
at
any
time
withdraw
their
accumulated
cash
value
of
his
share.
if
he
dies
during
the
pay-in
period,
his
beneficiary
will
receive
that
same
amount
or
a
refund
of
the
total
payments
paid
whichever
amount
is
larger.
now,
once
the
maturity
date
is
reached,
the
purchaser
is
no
longer
a
participant
in
the
flexible
fund.
at
that
time,
he
may
receive
in
the
cash
the
accumulated
value
of
his
pro
rata
interest
in
the
fund
or
he
may
purchase
of
any
several
conventional
annuities
with
the
accumulated
value
of
his
share.
in
either
case,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
security
laws
have
any
application
after
the
maturity
date
is
reached
and
the
purchaser
ceases
to
participate
in
the
fund.
so
there's
no
substantial
difference,
we
submit,
between
the
valic
contract
and
this
one
except
that
in
valic,
the
purchasers
interest
in
the
variable
fund
there
involved
continued
past
the
maturity
date.
before
i
compare
more
points
of
flexible
fund
to
the
investment
contract
in
valic,
first
we
should
point
out
a
single
comparison
between
the
flexible
fund
and
ordinary
deferred
annuity
life
insurance
and
conventional
savings
accounts,
a
comparison
which
we
have
made
in
our
brief
at
pages
24
and
25.
there
it
would
appear
that
an
annuity,
let's
say,
a
male
at
the
age
of
35,
who
pays
a
$100
per
month
for
30
years
total
of
$36,000
for
respondent's
ordinary
deferred
annuity
life
insurance,
he
would
have
been
guaranteed
$54,828
at
the
maturity
date.
but
under
the
flexible
fund
contract,
the
same
man
making
the
same
payment
is
guaranteed
only
$33,174
being
the
sum
of
the
net
premium,
$2826
less
than
he
would
have
had
if
he
put
the
money
in
his
mattress.
over
$21,000
less
than
he
would
have
had
from
respondent's
ordinary
deferred
annuity
insurance
and
over
$36,000
less
than
he
would
have
had,
had
he
put
the
$100
monthly
in
a
conventional
savings
account.
in
short,
the
purchasers
of
the
flexible
fund
contract
are
foregoing
some
$20,000
to
$30,000
in
savings
in
the
hope
of
gaining
appreciably
through
participation
in
the
stock
market
under
respondent's
management.
indeed
the
inducement
of
purchase
is
the
prospect
of
speculative
gain
rather
than
the
certainties
of
insurance
that
is
shown
by
the
respondent's
sales
literature.
i
have
in
my
hand
here
one
of
the
brochures
which
from
beginning
to
end
speaks
about
how
much
you
can
make
in
the
market.
on
the
middle
page,
for
example,
it
puts
great
emphasis
on
the
dow
jones
average
and
other
items.
as
no
regard
at
all
to
insurance,
it's
obviously
urging
people
as
they
say
to
participate
in
the
upsurge
of
our
economy,
and
to
them,
that
this
is
in
the
large
record
at
page
10,
the
whole
brochure
there.
the
contract
is
represented
as
providing,
“a
chance
to
share
in
the
growth
of
the
country's
economy”,
and
in
which
the
investments
in
this
securities
market
is
emphasized
in
various
ways.
we
think
that
when
such
an
interest,
one
that
fluctuates
with
the
value
of
the
fund
of
securities
is
being
offered
and
sold,
it
is
our
position
then
that
it
was
intended
that
the
investors
be
afforded
the
protections
of
the
federal
security
laws.
the
principal
difference
between
the
variable
annuity
in
valic
and
the
flexible
fund
is
that
the
latter
has
a
flaw;
that
is
the
flexible
fund
contract
guarantees
the
purchaser
a
certain
fixed
minimum
amount.
the
court
below
found
that
difference
in
the
light
of
the
valic
decision
could
be
so
persuasive
that
the
insurance
exceptions
are
applicable
to
the
flexible
fund.
so
i
would
go
into
this
minimum
guarantee
with
so
much
reliance
was
placed
upon.
respondent
guarantees
that
upon
withdrawal
from
participation
in
the
fund,
the
purchaser
shall
receive
not
less
than
a
stated
percentage
of
its
aggregate
purchased
payments.
we
have
set
that
out
on
the
charts
on
our
brief
on
page
5,
and
also
34
and
37.
but
it's
undeniable
that
the
guarantee
involved
the
assumption
of
some
risk
by
the
respondents,
certainly
that's
true,
but
at
some,
with
emphasis
on
some,
although
as
i'll
show,
it's
not
an
investment
risk
as
it
has
been
understood
in
the
insurance
acts.
if
that
respondent
contends
the
critical
test
is
whether
the
issuing
company
assumes
any
element
of
“risk”
by
setting
a
flow
no
matter
how
low
even
one
that
is
lower
than
the
total
payments
made
by
the
purchaser
then
i
can
see
we're
out
of
court.
however,
i
think
as
respondent
derives
that
test
from
too
personal
reading
of
valic.
respondent's
guaranteed
minimum
is
always
less
than
the
aggregate
payments
made
by
the
purchaser.
after
ten
years,
it
does
reach
the
extent
of
the
net
premiums
which
at
that
point
is
equivalent
to
about
86.5%
of
the
total
claims.
and
after
25
years,
it
approaches,
but
never
reaches
90%
of
the
total
purchase
payments.
in
short,
as
the
amicus
curiae
persuasively
showed
in
pages
30
to
38
of
its
brief,
the
respondent
actually
assumes
no
investment
risk
in
the
general
sense
of
the
word
in
the
insurance
vernacular,
nor
does
it
begin
to
reach
what
was
mentioned
in
the
valic
case
as
being
controlling,
or
in
the
sense
commonly
accepted
in
the
insurance
field.
investment
risk
involves
the
guarantee
of
some
return
on
your
capital,
not
merely
the
return
of
the
capital
itself.
and
as
the
majority
said
in
valic,
investment
risk
in
insurance
sense
involves
the
guarantee
of
a
fixed
return
and
assured
yields
in
one's
investment.
neither
the
contract
in
valic
nor
the
contract
here
has
any
such
assured
yield.
in
lieu
of
the
guaranteed
yield
on
the
normal
annuity
policy,
the
purchase
of
either
the
flexible
fund
or
the
old
valic
contract
looks
to
the
vicissitudes
of
the
stock
market
and
the
respondent's
investment
acumen.
of
course,
the
hope
is
that
the
economy
and
the
market,
and
the
respondent's
skill
to
produce
a
yield
far
exceeding
the
return
available
on
an
ordinary
annuity
policy.
but
the
short
of
it
is
that
the
touchstone
of
insurance,
a
fixed
return
or
guaranteed
yield
on
payments
is
entirely
missing
here
and
for
the
ultimate
interest
of
a
flexible
fund
contract,
the
purchaser
depends
on
the
value
of
the
portfolio
of
securities
which
the
insurance
company
manages.
mr.
marshall
we
--
we
take
the
position
that
until
maturity,
while
there
is
participation
in
this
portfolio,
it
is
subject
to
sec
regulations.
after
that,
it
would
not
be.
we
also
recommend
in
our
brief
that
because
of
that,
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
position,
if
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
so
that
it
could
be
worked
out
ways
with
some
of
the
others.
there
are
quite
a
few
of
these
that
have
been
registered
and
are
now
operating
under
the
regulations
of
sec
which
certain
modifications
and
certain
exemptions
are
given
by
sec
so
that
it
will
work.
but
in
this
particular
one,
we
say
after
maturity,
we
don't
believe
the
regulations
will
apply
because
the
--
the
money
is
then
a
fixed
amount.
mr.
marshall
well,
what
actually
--
mr.
marshall
--
happened
in
valic,
they
went
out
--
mr.
marshall
yes
sir,
but
they
went
back
and
they
are
now
registered
and
they're
not
doing
business.
they've
been
doing
business
ever
since.
mr.
marshall
well,
i
think
they're
both
in
there
are.
they're
both
--
they
both
do.
mr.
marshall
the
valic
--
incidentally,
the
valic
when
registered
on
february
of
1960,
they
registered
with
the
commission
and
they've
been
operating
ever
since.
but
the
insurance
as
we
see
it,
there
would
be
an
annuity
insurance
policy
on
this
side
of
the
portfolio
and
on
the
other
side
would
be
the
flexible
fund.
the
fund
part
would
be
regulated
by
sec.
once
the
maturity
date
is
reached,
there
would
have
to
be
some
decision
made
as
to
what's
done
with
the
sec
part.
but
we
don't
--
we
do
not
see
that
the
regulations
would
cover
once
there's
no
more
participation
in
the
portfolio.
i
might
say
that
the
records
of
sec
showed
that
there
are
quite
a
few,
that
are
different
in
variable
companies
that
are
still
operating
under
the
regulations
of
sec.
and
indeed,
third
circuit
had
one
which
this
court
denies
certiorari,
prudential
which
did
go
back
to
the
commission
and
it
was
regulated
and
it's
still
operating.
it
is
a
subtle
teaching
in
this
court
in
deciding
whether
one
comes
within
an
exemption
to
the
security
laws,
the
focal
point
of
the
inquiry
should
be
on
the
need
of
the
investor
for
the
protections
afforded
by
the
security
acts,
thus
we
feel
that
rather
than
approaching
the
issue
from
the
standpoint
of
allocating
the
risk
of
the
company
assumes,
an
approach
which
invites
further
litigation,
it
is
more
fruitful
to
look
to
the
financial
realities
of
the
product
offered
and
sold
if
it
is
one
like
the
flexible
fund.
the
public
is
invited
to
participate
in
the
investment
experience
of
a
portfolio
of
securities
managed
by
another
and
having
no
substantial
assured
yield.
here
as
i
early
indicated,
the
public
is
invited
to
forego
any
guaranteed
yield
on
their
amount
of
money
and
the
hope
that
the
respondent's
investment
experiences
will
more
than
make
up
for
the
loss
of
that
guarantee.
the
federal
security
laws
were
designed
precisely
to
protect
the
public
in
such
situations.
first,
the
securities
act
of
1933
provides
for
full
disclosure
of
the
information
necessary
to
enable
the
purchaser
of
the
security
intelligently
to
appraise
the
risks
involved.
the
disclosure
provisions
might
have
required
respondents
in
this
case
for
example
to
indicate
more
clearly
the
tax
status
of
the
fund
in
the
brochure.
the
disclosure
provisions
might
have
required
a
statement
in
the
perspectives
more
clear
than
that
in
the
respondent
sales
brochure.
but
since
the
substantial
portion
of
the
flexible
fund
is
invested
in
fixed
return
securities,
its
performance
could
not
be
expected
to
parallel
the
performance
of
the
dow
jones
average
which
it
makes
so
much
of,
so
prominently
featured.
and
the
securities
act
requirement
had
a
registration
statement
and
perspectives
contained
a
financial
statement
certified
by
an
independent
accountant
with
detail
information
on
the
financial
status
of
the
company
would
require
a
balance
sheet
for
the
flexible
fund,
totally
absent
from
any
of
respondent's
sales
literature.
then
as
to
the
act,
securities
act
of
1940,
so
called
corporate
democracy
provisions,
well,
under
that
act,
the
additional
protection
would
be
afforded
to
those
whose
interest
takes
the
form
of
a
participation
in
the
pool.
the
applicability
of
that
act
to
the
respondent's
fund
would
ensure
the
furnishing
of
information
such
as
affiliation
of
the
fund's
directors,
the
semi-annual
financial
reports
again,
moreover,
this
substantial
sales
charge
would
be
regulated
and
the
participants
in
the
fund
would
be
accorded
a
measure
of
control
for
example
since
the
act
prohibits
investment
companies
from
changing
investment
policies
without
shareholder
approval.
the
purchasers
of
the
respondent's
flexible
fund
contracts
would
be
informed
that
it's
invested
in
one-third
to
two-third
ratio
at
fixed
return
securities
to
come
in
stock
and
would
have
to
say
--
should
manage
--
would
have
to
say
should
management
desire
a
change
to
a
more
conservative
investment
policy
which
might
render
the
value
of
purchaser's
interests
far
more
akin
to
the
return
of
an
ordinary
deferred
annuity
than
warranted
by
the
guaranteed
savings
were
gone
and
the
service
charge
was
paid
by
the
participant.
in
short,
when
the
investor
is
informed
and
induced
to
buy
and
in
reality
purchases
an
interest
that
fluctuates
with
the
value
of
fund
and
securities,
the
protection
of
the
federal
securities
laws
are
vital
and
those
afforded
by
the
customer
state
regulations
of
insurance
companies
are
just
the
opposite
as
to
what
is
required
as
pointed
out
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
valic.
moreover,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
starting
at
page
21,
not
only
it's
a
fund
similar
to
the
variable
annuity
fund
in
valic
but
also
it
is
substantially
similar
to
the
open-ended
management
company
commonly
called
the
mutual
fund.
indeed
as
the
--
again
as
the
amicus
curiae
points
out
in
their
brief,
pages
26
to
30,
it
is
essentially
indistinguishable
to
presently
offer
so-called
split-funded
programs
under
which
purchasers
of
investment
company
shares
can
convert
a
share
into
a
fixed
dollar
annuity.
by
recasting
the
flexible
fund
in
the
terms
of
a
package
composed
of
respondent's
ordinary
deferred
annuity
and
mutual
fund
shares,
no
significantly
different
financial
benefit
or
result
occurs
to
the
purchaser
of
that
split-funded
plan
than
to
the
purchaser
of
the
respondent's
flexible
fund
plan.
so,
in
view,
the
investor
in
the
fund
should
obviously
be
afforded
the
same
investor
protection
and
as
those
same
examples
showed,
the
respondent
may
continue
to
provide
virtually
the
same
services
it
now
offers.
there's
nothing
in
the
valic
decision
or
the
judgment
of
this
court
or
the
records
that
would
show
what
happened
to
valic
and
other
companies
in
the
future
that
even
pretends
to
show
that
this
same
fund
cannot
continue
to
operate
and
operate
under
registration
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
and
all
we
seek
here
is
that
the
respondent
be
required
to
provide,
to
register
of
course,
and
to
be
--
provide
the
detailed
information,
comply
with
the
other
protective
measures
which
congress
thought
essential
for
those
who
entrust
their
money
to
others
who
for
any
return
must
depend
on
someone
else's
management
of
a
portfolio
of
securities
and
if
i
could
save
my
five
minutes.
mr.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
marshall
--
in
the
state.
mr.
marshall
well,
i
don't
see
that
all
trend
because
the
--
maybe
i
--
i
don't
quite
--
because
the
--
mr.
marshall
yes
--
mr.
marshall
well,
this
--
mr.
marshall
but
the
--
it's
what
they
do
want
to
the
state
insurance
act
which
is
insurance
but
they
cannot
under
the
guise
of
the
word
insurance
set
up
a
mutual
company.
the
reason
is
that
the
congress
exempted
the
insurance
companies
because
congress
realized
how
they
operate
it.
there
was
no
idea
that
they
would
be
exempt
for
all
purposes.
it
was
at
that
insurance
activities
would
be
exempted,
because
even
the
district
court
was
driven
to
use
the
phrase
this
is
an
insurance
product
--
mr.
marshall
we
--
mr.
marshall
we
--
we
do
not
say
that
this
is
within
--
the
argument
we've
made
on
the
flexible
fund,
we
say
that
is
clearly
not
insurance.
it
is
clearly
an
investment
procedure
similar
to
the
average
mutual
fund
and
therefore
does
not
qualify
for
the
exemption.
there
is
nothing
in
any
state
insurance
law
that
requires
the
company
to
report
to
the
--
it's
--
its
policyholder
what
have
you.
it's
because
there
is
the
fixed
guarantee.
and
the
only
thing
the
company
--
the
state
is
interested
is
the
solvency
of
the
company.
it's
entirely
opposite
when
we
are
selling
securities
and
if
i
may
add,
we
start
--
we
had
in
the
beginning
of
our
argument
on
page
13
and
the
footnote
covers
the
point
of
the
case
in
the
footnote.
mr.
marshall
may
i
have
just
one
or
two
minutes
if
it
please
the
court.
this
brochure,
i
agree,
we
will
have
to
leave
it
here,
it's
in
the
record,
it's
the
second
document.
i
think
the
biggest
mistakes
that
the
two
courts
made
below
was
not
to
read
this
brochure
and
despite
what
is
said
here,
the
joiner
case
does
say
that
enforcement
of
an
act
such
as
this,
it
is
not
inappropriate
that
promoters
offerings
be
judged
as
being
what
they
were
represented
to
be.
i
think
that
this
argument
shows
exactly
the
difference
between
state
insurance
laws
and
the
securities
law.
mr.
marshall
the
state
regulation
is
entirely
different.
there's
nothing
in
the
state
regulation
that
prevents
them
from
issuing
brochures
of
this
type.
mr.
marshall
well,
there
is
--
mr.
marshall
it's
not
that
--
either
all
--
mr.
marshall
yes.
mr.
marshall
it
wouldn't
help
the
investor
at
all.
the
--
the
only
way
the
investor
is
helped
is
by
a
fixed
money
dollar
return.
that's
the
only
way
that
he
is
protected
and
the
state
law
is
to
protect
the
solvency
of
united.
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
our
brief
on
pages
16
and
25
to
26
we
do
explained
the
features
in
this
perspectives
and
i
say,
that
in
all
fairness,
this
is
not
insurance
and
i
return
to
the
point
that
the
two
be
spread
up
that
the
district
or
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
on
the
breaking
down
of
the
two
policies.
thank
you.
mr.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case
united
of
omaha
sells
to
the
public
or
had
been
selling
to
the
public
what
it
called
a
flexible
fund
annuity
under
which
the
value
of
the
purchaser's
ultimate
interest
depended
in
significant
part
upon
the
value
of
a
regular
portfolio
of
securities,
largely
common
stocks
and
in
which
the
respondent
manages.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
believing
the
flexible
fund
annuity
to
be
subject
to
the
federal
securities
act
sought
to
enjoin
the
respondents
from
offering
these
securities
and
selling
it
out
complying
with
the
registration
provisions
of
both
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
1940
act.
to
remember,
both
of
these
statutes
contained
exemptions
for
“insurance”
and
so
the
question
in
this
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
whether
the
flexible
fund
is
within
those
insurance
exemptions
in
both
the
1933
and
the
1940
acts.
mr.
marshall
not
that
i
know
of.
it's
about
the
mutual
companies
in
general.
mr.
marshall
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
marshall
no
sir,
no
sir.
the
district
court
ruled
that
this
flexible
fund
was
an
insurance
product
within
the
exemptions
and
it
therefore
declined
the
grant
the
requested
relief
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
viewing
the
fund
is
significantly
different
from
the
variable
annuity
contract
which
this
court
held
to
be
subject
to
the
federal
securities
law
in
the
valic
case.
and
here
we
urged
that
the
flexible
fund
contract
like
the
contract
in
valic,
is
a
kind
of
interest
extended
to
be
--
intended
to
be
regulated
by
the
securities
act.
and
conversely,
that
like
the
contract
which
was
in
valic,
it
is
not
the
kind
of
product
intended
to
be
exempted
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
insurance
products.
the
nature
of
the
flexible
fund
contract
like
the
one
in
valic
requires
that
it's
purchasers
be
given
the
investment
protection
that
congress
designed
for
those
who
are
offered
in
sole
participation
and
a
pool
of
equity
securities
and
interests
that
fluctuates
in
accordance
with
the
value
of
a
portfolio
securities
managed
by
some
other
people.
now
under
the
flexible
fund,
the
purchaser
makes
fixed
periodic
payments
until
the
pre-selected
maturity
date,
usually
some
20
or
30
years
from
now.
after
expenses
are
deducted
from
these
premiums
or
anything
from
50%
in
the
first
year
to
nine
and
a
half
for
the
next
nine
years,
and
5%
thereafter,
the
balance
of
the
net
premiums
are
put
into
a
separate
fund
by
the
respondent.
this
fund
is
reduced
each
month
by
an
amount
totaling
1%
per
year
and
by
an
allowance
for
the
respondent's
taxes.
the
remainder
is
invested
in
a
portfolio
of
securities
as
i
mentioned
before
largely
common
stock
securities,
certainly
equities.
during
the
pay-in
period,
the
period
prior
to
the
selected
maturity
date,
the
purchaser
may
at
any
time
withdraw
their
accumulated
cash
value
of
his
share.
if
he
dies
during
the
pay-in
period,
his
beneficiary
will
receive
that
same
amount
or
a
refund
of
the
total
payments
paid
whichever
amount
is
larger.
now,
once
the
maturity
date
is
reached,
the
purchaser
is
no
longer
a
participant
in
the
flexible
fund.
at
that
time,
he
may
receive
in
the
cash
the
accumulated
value
of
his
pro
rata
interest
in
the
fund
or
he
may
purchase
of
any
several
conventional
annuities
with
the
accumulated
value
of
his
share.
in
either
case,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
security
laws
have
any
application
after
the
maturity
date
is
reached
and
the
purchaser
ceases
to
participate
in
the
fund.
so
there's
no
substantial
difference,
we
submit,
between
the
valic
contract
and
this
one
except
that
in
valic,
the
purchasers
interest
in
the
variable
fund
there
involved
continued
past
the
maturity
date.
before
i
compare
more
points
of
flexible
fund
to
the
investment
contract
in
valic,
first
we
should
point
out
a
single
comparison
between
the
flexible
fund
and
ordinary
deferred
annuity
life
insurance
and
conventional
savings
accounts,
a
comparison
which
we
have
made
in
our
brief
at
pages
24
and
25.
there
it
would
appear
that
an
annuity,
let's
say,
a
male
at
the
age
of
35,
who
pays
a
$100
per
month
for
30
years
total
of
$36,000
for
respondent's
ordinary
deferred
annuity
life
insurance,
he
would
have
been
guaranteed
$54,828
at
the
maturity
date.
but
under
the
flexible
fund
contract,
the
same
man
making
the
same
payment
is
guaranteed
only
$33,174
being
the
sum
of
the
net
premium,
$2826
less
than
he
would
have
had
if
he
put
the
money
in
his
mattress.
over
$21,000
less
than
he
would
have
had
from
respondent's
ordinary
deferred
annuity
insurance
and
over
$36,000
less
than
he
would
have
had,
had
he
put
the
$100
monthly
in
a
conventional
savings
account.
in
short,
the
purchasers
of
the
flexible
fund
contract
are
foregoing
some
$20,000
to
$30,000
in
savings
in
the
hope
of
gaining
appreciably
through
participation
in
the
stock
market
under
respondent's
management.
indeed
the
inducement
of
purchase
is
the
prospect
of
speculative
gain
rather
than
the
certainties
of
insurance
that
is
shown
by
the
respondent's
sales
literature.
i
have
in
my
hand
here
one
of
the
brochures
which
from
beginning
to
end
speaks
about
how
much
you
can
make
in
the
market.
on
the
middle
page,
for
example,
it
puts
great
emphasis
on
the
dow
jones
average
and
other
items.
as
no
regard
at
all
to
insurance,
it's
obviously
urging
people
as
they
say
to
participate
in
the
upsurge
of
our
economy,
and
to
them,
that
this
is
in
the
large
record
at
page
10,
the
whole
brochure
there.
the
contract
is
represented
as
providing,
“a
chance
to
share
in
the
growth
of
the
country's
economy”,
and
in
which
the
investments
in
this
securities
market
is
emphasized
in
various
ways.
we
think
that
when
such
an
interest,
one
that
fluctuates
with
the
value
of
the
fund
of
securities
is
being
offered
and
sold,
it
is
our
position
then
that
it
was
intended
that
the
investors
be
afforded
the
protections
of
the
federal
security
laws.
the
principal
difference
between
the
variable
annuity
in
valic
and
the
flexible
fund
is
that
the
latter
has
a
flaw;
that
is
the
flexible
fund
contract
guarantees
the
purchaser
a
certain
fixed
minimum
amount.
the
court
below
found
that
difference
in
the
light
of
the
valic
decision
could
be
so
persuasive
that
the
insurance
exceptions
are
applicable
to
the
flexible
fund.
so
i
would
go
into
this
minimum
guarantee
with
so
much
reliance
was
placed
upon.
respondent
guarantees
that
upon
withdrawal
from
participation
in
the
fund,
the
purchaser
shall
receive
not
less
than
a
stated
percentage
of
its
aggregate
purchased
payments.
we
have
set
that
out
on
the
charts
on
our
brief
on
page
5,
and
also
34
and
37.
but
it's
undeniable
that
the
guarantee
involved
the
assumption
of
some
risk
by
the
respondents,
certainly
that's
true,
but
at
some,
with
emphasis
on
some,
although
as
i'll
show,
it's
not
an
investment
risk
as
it
has
been
understood
in
the
insurance
acts.
if
that
respondent
contends
the
critical
test
is
whether
the
issuing
company
assumes
any
element
of
“risk”
by
setting
a
flow
no
matter
how
low
even
one
that
is
lower
than
the
total
payments
made
by
the
purchaser
then
i
can
see
we're
out
of
court.
however,
i
think
as
respondent
derives
that
test
from
too
personal
reading
of
valic.
respondent's
guaranteed
minimum
is
always
less
than
the
aggregate
payments
made
by
the
purchaser.
after
ten
years,
it
does
reach
the
extent
of
the
net
premiums
which
at
that
point
is
equivalent
to
about
86.5%
of
the
total
claims.
and
after
25
years,
it
approaches,
but
never
reaches
90%
of
the
total
purchase
payments.
in
short,
as
the
amicus
curiae
persuasively
showed
in
pages
30
to
38
of
its
brief,
the
respondent
actually
assumes
no
investment
risk
in
the
general
sense
of
the
word
in
the
insurance
vernacular,
nor
does
it
begin
to
reach
what
was
mentioned
in
the
valic
case
as
being
controlling,
or
in
the
sense
commonly
accepted
in
the
insurance
field.
investment
risk
involves
the
guarantee
of
some
return
on
your
capital,
not
merely
the
return
of
the
capital
itself.
and
as
the
majority
said
in
valic,
investment
risk
in
insurance
sense
involves
the
guarantee
of
a
fixed
return
and
assured
yields
in
one's
investment.
neither
the
contract
in
valic
nor
the
contract
here
has
any
such
assured
yield.
in
lieu
of
the
guaranteed
yield
on
the
normal
annuity
policy,
the
purchase
of
either
the
flexible
fund
or
the
old
valic
contract
looks
to
the
vicissitudes
of
the
stock
market
and
the
respondent's
investment
acumen.
of
course,
the
hope
is
that
the
economy
and
the
market,
and
the
respondent's
skill
to
produce
a
yield
far
exceeding
the
return
available
on
an
ordinary
annuity
policy.
but
the
short
of
it
is
that
the
touchstone
of
insurance,
a
fixed
return
or
guaranteed
yield
on
payments
is
entirely
missing
here
and
for
the
ultimate
interest
of
a
flexible
fund
contract,
the
purchaser
depends
on
the
value
of
the
portfolio
of
securities
which
the
insurance
company
manages.
mr.
marshall
we
--
we
take
the
position
that
until
maturity,
while
there
is
participation
in
this
portfolio,
it
is
subject
to
sec
regulations.
after
that,
it
would
not
be.
we
also
recommend
in
our
brief
that
because
of
that,
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
position,
if
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
so
that
it
could
be
worked
out
ways
with
some
of
the
others.
there
are
quite
a
few
of
these
that
have
been
registered
and
are
now
operating
under
the
regulations
of
sec
which
certain
modifications
and
certain
exemptions
are
given
by
sec
so
that
it
will
work.
but
in
this
particular
one,
we
say
after
maturity,
we
don't
believe
the
regulations
will
apply
because
the
--
the
money
is
then
a
fixed
amount.
mr.
marshall
well,
what
actually
--
mr.
marshall
--
happened
in
valic,
they
went
out
--
mr.
marshall
yes
sir,
but
they
went
back
and
they
are
now
registered
and
they're
not
doing
business.
they've
been
doing
business
ever
since.
mr.
marshall
well,
i
think
they're
both
in
there
are.
they're
both
--
they
both
do.
mr.
marshall
the
valic
--
incidentally,
the
valic
when
registered
on
february
of
1960,
they
registered
with
the
commission
and
they've
been
operating
ever
since.
but
the
insurance
as
we
see
it,
there
would
be
an
annuity
insurance
policy
on
this
side
of
the
portfolio
and
on
the
other
side
would
be
the
flexible
fund.
the
fund
part
would
be
regulated
by
sec.
once
the
maturity
date
is
reached,
there
would
have
to
be
some
decision
made
as
to
what's
done
with
the
sec
part.
but
we
don't
--
we
do
not
see
that
the
regulations
would
cover
once
there's
no
more
participation
in
the
portfolio.
i
might
say
that
the
records
of
sec
showed
that
there
are
quite
a
few,
that
are
different
in
variable
companies
that
are
still
operating
under
the
regulations
of
sec.
and
indeed,
third
circuit
had
one
which
this
court
denies
certiorari,
prudential
which
did
go
back
to
the
commission
and
it
was
regulated
and
it's
still
operating.
it
is
a
subtle
teaching
in
this
court
in
deciding
whether
one
comes
within
an
exemption
to
the
security
laws,
the
focal
point
of
the
inquiry
should
be
on
the
need
of
the
investor
for
the
protections
afforded
by
the
security
acts,
thus
we
feel
that
rather
than
approaching
the
issue
from
the
standpoint
of
allocating
the
risk
of
the
company
assumes,
an
approach
which
invites
further
litigation,
it
is
more
fruitful
to
look
to
the
financial
realities
of
the
product
offered
and
sold
if
it
is
one
like
the
flexible
fund.
the
public
is
invited
to
participate
in
the
investment
experience
of
a
portfolio
of
securities
managed
by
another
and
having
no
substantial
assured
yield.
here
as
i
early
indicated,
the
public
is
invited
to
forego
any
guaranteed
yield
on
their
amount
of
money
and
the
hope
that
the
respondent's
investment
experiences
will
more
than
make
up
for
the
loss
of
that
guarantee.
the
federal
security
laws
were
designed
precisely
to
protect
the
public
in
such
situations.
first,
the
securities
act
of
1933
provides
for
full
disclosure
of
the
information
necessary
to
enable
the
purchaser
of
the
security
intelligently
to
appraise
the
risks
involved.
the
disclosure
provisions
might
have
required
respondents
in
this
case
for
example
to
indicate
more
clearly
the
tax
status
of
the
fund
in
the
brochure.
the
disclosure
provisions
might
have
required
a
statement
in
the
perspectives
more
clear
than
that
in
the
respondent
sales
brochure.
but
since
the
substantial
portion
of
the
flexible
fund
is
invested
in
fixed
return
securities,
its
performance
could
not
be
expected
to
parallel
the
performance
of
the
dow
jones
average
which
it
makes
so
much
of,
so
prominently
featured.
and
the
securities
act
requirement
had
a
registration
statement
and
perspectives
contained
a
financial
statement
certified
by
an
independent
accountant
with
detail
information
on
the
financial
status
of
the
company
would
require
a
balance
sheet
for
the
flexible
fund,
totally
absent
from
any
of
respondent's
sales
literature.
then
as
to
the
act,
securities
act
of
1940,
so
called
corporate
democracy
provisions,
well,
under
that
act,
the
additional
protection
would
be
afforded
to
those
whose
interest
takes
the
form
of
a
participation
in
the
pool.
the
applicability
of
that
act
to
the
respondent's
fund
would
ensure
the
furnishing
of
information
such
as
affiliation
of
the
fund's
directors,
the
semi-annual
financial
reports
again,
moreover,
this
substantial
sales
charge
would
be
regulated
and
the
participants
in
the
fund
would
be
accorded
a
measure
of
control
for
example
since
the
act
prohibits
investment
companies
from
changing
investment
policies
without
shareholder
approval.
the
purchasers
of
the
respondent's
flexible
fund
contracts
would
be
informed
that
it's
invested
in
one-third
to
two-third
ratio
at
fixed
return
securities
to
come
in
stock
and
would
have
to
say
--
should
manage
--
would
have
to
say
should
management
desire
a
change
to
a
more
conservative
investment
policy
which
might
render
the
value
of
purchaser's
interests
far
more
akin
to
the
return
of
an
ordinary
deferred
annuity
than
warranted
by
the
guaranteed
savings
were
gone
and
the
service
charge
was
paid
by
the
participant.
in
short,
when
the
investor
is
informed
and
induced
to
buy
and
in
reality
purchases
an
interest
that
fluctuates
with
the
value
of
fund
and
securities,
the
protection
of
the
federal
securities
laws
are
vital
and
those
afforded
by
the
customer
state
regulations
of
insurance
companies
are
just
the
opposite
as
to
what
is
required
as
pointed
out
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
valic.
moreover,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
starting
at
page
21,
not
only
it's
a
fund
similar
to
the
variable
annuity
fund
in
valic
but
also
it
is
substantially
similar
to
the
open-ended
management
company
commonly
called
the
mutual
fund.
indeed
as
the
--
again
as
the
amicus
curiae
points
out
in
their
brief,
pages
26
to
30,
it
is
essentially
indistinguishable
to
presently
offer
so-called
split-funded
programs
under
which
purchasers
of
investment
company
shares
can
convert
a
share
into
a
fixed
dollar
annuity.
by
recasting
the
flexible
fund
in
the
terms
of
a
package
composed
of
respondent's
ordinary
deferred
annuity
and
mutual
fund
shares,
no
significantly
different
financial
benefit
or
result
occurs
to
the
purchaser
of
that
split-funded
plan
than
to
the
purchaser
of
the
respondent's
flexible
fund
plan.
so,
in
view,
the
investor
in
the
fund
should
obviously
be
afforded
the
same
investor
protection
and
as
those
same
examples
showed,
the
respondent
may
continue
to
provide
virtually
the
same
services
it
now
offers.
there's
nothing
in
the
valic
decision
or
the
judgment
of
this
court
or
the
records
that
would
show
what
happened
to
valic
and
other
companies
in
the
future
that
even
pretends
to
show
that
this
same
fund
cannot
continue
to
operate
and
operate
under
registration
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
and
all
we
seek
here
is
that
the
respondent
be
required
to
provide,
to
register
of
course,
and
to
be
--
provide
the
detailed
information,
comply
with
the
other
protective
measures
which
congress
thought
essential
for
those
who
entrust
their
money
to
others
who
for
any
return
must
depend
on
someone
else's
management
of
a
portfolio
of
securities
and
if
i
could
save
my
five
minutes.
mr.
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
marshall
--
in
the
state.
mr.
marshall
well,
i
don't
see
that
all
trend
because
the
--
maybe
i
--
i
don't
quite
--
because
the
--
mr.
marshall
yes
--
mr.
marshall
well,
this
--
mr.
marshall
but
the
--
it's
what
they
do
want
to
the
state
insurance
act
which
is
insurance
but
they
cannot
under
the
guise
of
the
word
insurance
set
up
a
mutual
company.
the
reason
is
that
the
congress
exempted
the
insurance
companies
because
congress
realized
how
they
operate
it.
there
was
no
idea
that
they
would
be
exempt
for
all
purposes.
it
was
at
that
insurance
activities
would
be
exempted,
because
even
the
district
court
was
driven
to
use
the
phrase
this
is
an
insurance
product
--
mr.
marshall
we
--
mr.
marshall
we
--
we
do
not
say
that
this
is
within
--
the
argument
we've
made
on
the
flexible
fund,
we
say
that
is
clearly
not
insurance.
it
is
clearly
an
investment
procedure
similar
to
the
average
mutual
fund
and
therefore
does
not
qualify
for
the
exemption.
there
is
nothing
in
any
state
insurance
law
that
requires
the
company
to
report
to
the
--
it's
--
its
policyholder
what
have
you.
it's
because
there
is
the
fixed
guarantee.
and
the
only
thing
the
company
--
the
state
is
interested
is
the
solvency
of
the
company.
it's
entirely
opposite
when
we
are
selling
securities
and
if
i
may
add,
we
start
--
we
had
in
the
beginning
of
our
argument
on
page
13
and
the
footnote
covers
the
point
of
the
case
in
the
footnote.
mr.
marshall
may
i
have
just
one
or
two
minutes
if
it
please
the
court.
this
brochure,
i
agree,
we
will
have
to
leave
it
here,
it's
in
the
record,
it's
the
second
document.
i
think
the
biggest
mistakes
that
the
two
courts
made
below
was
not
to
read
this
brochure
and
despite
what
is
said
here,
the
joiner
case
does
say
that
enforcement
of
an
act
such
as
this,
it
is
not
inappropriate
that
promoters
offerings
be
judged
as
being
what
they
were
represented
to
be.
i
think
that
this
argument
shows
exactly
the
difference
between
state
insurance
laws
and
the
securities
law.
mr.
marshall
the
state
regulation
is
entirely
different.
there's
nothing
in
the
state
regulation
that
prevents
them
from
issuing
brochures
of
this
type.
mr.
marshall
well,
there
is
--
mr.
marshall
it's
not
that
--
either
all
--
mr.
marshall
yes.
mr.
marshall
it
wouldn't
help
the
investor
at
all.
the
--
the
only
way
the
investor
is
helped
is
by
a
fixed
money
dollar
return.
that's
the
only
way
that
he
is
protected
and
the
state
law
is
to
protect
the
solvency
of
united.
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
our
brief
on
pages
16
and
25
to
26
we
do
explained
the
features
in
this
perspectives
and
i
say,
that
in
all
fairness,
this
is
not
insurance
and
i
return
to
the
point
that
the
two
be
spread
up
that
the
district
or
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
on
the
breaking
down
of
the
two
policies.
thank
you.
