mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
it's
our
intention
to
discuss
the
contract,
the
statute
under
which
there's
an
exemption,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
valic
case,
the
policy
considerations
involved
with
respect
to
state
and
federal
regulation
and
the
comparisons
of
values
and
what
actually
is
being
sold.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
so
far
as
i
know
sir,
there
are
no
such
bills.
mr.
loomis,
the
general
counsel
of
the
commission
is
here
and
he
would
know.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
the
approach
which
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
takes
through
the
solicitor
general
is
that
in
an
analysis
of
this
contract,
you
don't
take
the
four
corners
of
the
document
and
all
of
its
pages
and
the
view
what
is
the
basic
undertaking
and
what
is
the
basic
responsibility
of
the
company
and
what
are
they
selling
and
what
is
the
purchaser
getting.
but
the
--
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
prefers
to
take
the
contract
and
break
it
up
into
fragments
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out.
for
example,
the
commission
takes
the
position
that
with
respect
to
this
contract,
there
is
no
yield
and
yet
for
the
entire
period
after
maturity,
in
which
there
is
a
payment
of
guaranteed
fixed
dollars
to
the
annuitant,
there
is
a
yield
which
is
set
forth
in
the
contract.
then,
it
would
seemed
to
us
that
to
wipe
out
this
entire
phase
of
the
contract
which
is
--
requires
the
company
to
undertake
substantial
investment
undertakings,
tends
to
--
towards
superficiality
to
ignore
basically
what
are
the
obligations
of
the
company.
the
statute
covers
in
its
exemption
provisions
not
only
insurance
and
endowments
and
annuities,
but
the
statute
--
the
statute
also
covers
optional
annuities.
so
that
in
1933
when
the
securities
act
was
adopted,
the
congress
very
clearly
had
in
mind
the
whole
concept
of
an
optional
annuity.
now,
in
it's
brief,
the
commission,
and
in
it's
oral
argument
and
the
amici
in
the
brief
lend
considerable
time
to
emphasizing
the
possibility
that
a
purchaser
of
such
a
contract
is
in
a
position
to
withdraw,
to
withdraw
before
maturity,
to
withdraw
after
maturity,
or
at
maturity,
and
that
there
is
no
fixed
and
firm
obligation
to
take
the
annuity.
i
think
we
have
to
analyze
that.
i
think
that
the
argument
tends
to
give
the
impression
that
the
contract
ought
to
be
fragmentized.
i
think
the
argument
tends
to
give
credence
to
the
idea
that
there
are
really
two
relationships
here.
but
on
analysis,
i'm
considering
that
the
congress
understood
in
the
beginning
in
1933
when
they
gave
in
the
statute
an
exemption
for
an
optional
annuity
that
congress
understood
clearly
that
a
person
buying
such
a
contract
would
have
at
maturity
the
option
to
withdraw
or
the
option
to
take
the
annuity.
and
we
have
cited
to
the
court
in
our
brief,
text
material
by
maclean
on
this
in
the
addition
contemporaneous
with
the
adoption
of
the
securities
law.
the
basic
guarantee
which
is
here
in
this
contract
regardless
of
the
argument
about
the
brochure
which
is
used
is
that
what
is
being
sold
here
by
the
company
is
a
policy
covering
insurance
and
annuity
under
which
the
purchaser
has
the
obligation
in
undertaking
of
the
company
from
the
very
beginning
to
give
him
fixed
values
and
to
give
him
a
guaranteed
payout,
a
guaranteed
lifetime
income
and
fix
calculable
dollars
under
the
contract.
in
its
brief,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
takes
considerable
time
to
review
again
the
concepts
of
what
are
an
investment
con
--
what
is
an
investment
contract,
vis-Ã -vis
what
is
this
contract.
now,
if
i
may
again
bring
the
court's
mind
back
in
focus
to
the
fact
that
we
suggest
and
urge
that
the
whole
undertaking
has
to
be
reviewed.
but
just
for
the
purpose
of
analysis
look
to
what
the
gov
--
to
the
--
to
what
the
sec
said.
they
say
that
from
the
beginning,
there
is
here
a
so-called
mutual
fund
obligation
for
the
pay-in
period
of
the
contract.
they
say
that
the
guarantees
which
are
--
which
exist
here
are
insubstantial.
they
say
that
there
is
here
nothing
more
than
a
mutual
fund
for
this
part
of
the
design.
on
the
contrary,
if
you
examine
the
contract
that
has
been
issued
by
united
benefit
life
and
if
you
examine
another
exhibit
in
this
record
which
is
the
conventional
annuity
which
was
issued
by
united
benefit
life,
had
always
has
been
in
is
similar
in
form
to
the
conventional
annuity
that
other
companies
do
issue
in
which
there
is
clearly
a
yield,
an
undertaking
--
an
undertaking
to
invest
money
during
the
pay-in
period
on
a
guaranteed
interest
return
basis.
within
those
contracts
you
have
the
death
benefit
which
you
have
in
the
flexible
fund
annuity,
you
have
the
cash
value
which
is
present
in
the
flexible
fund
annuity,
and
really
you
don't
have
to
have
a
cash
value
to
make
an
annuity.
anyone
can
undertake
on
the
payment
of
my
--
of
my
payment
to
him
of
the
sum
of
money
by
the
application
of
actuarial
tables,
to
payout
that
money
to
me
for
as
long
as
i
live
and
maybe
end
up
with
a
profit
and
not
have
--
or
not
have
a
profit.
but
he
doesn't
have
to
invest
it,
the
mere
fact
that
he
would
pay
it
out
to
me
on
a
mortality
basis
is
really
the
essence
of
an
annuity
and
what
was
done
originally
when
annuities
were
first
written.
those
annuities
aren't
popular
today.
those
annuities
aren't
popular
because
people
came
to
realize
that
this
type
of
tontine
arrangement
without
them
having
an
opportunity
to
get
a
return
of
investment
was
not
a
valuable
economic
thing.
so
then
the
insurance
companies
had
to
move
to
another
type
of
investment
of
--
of
annuities,
one
which
gave
a
return,
one
which
appreciative
by
way
of
investment,
the
principle
which
had
been
paid
in
by
the
policyholder.
and
as
the
concept
in
life
insurance
developed
that
a
policy
of
insurance
should
have
cash
values
and
you
should
not
have
forfeitures
and
then
these
nonforfeiture
laws
were
develop
the
same
theory
was
applied
to
annuities
and
annuities
now
today,
for
the
most
part,
to
be
saleable
have
to
have
cash
values
over
the
period
of
time.
and
what
does
the
company
do
in
facing
to
the
fact
that
if
a
person
buys
an
annuity
at
age
30
or
at
age
35
and
he
comes
in
to
benefit
at
age
65,
and
if
he
has
to
take
--
if
he
has
to
take
the
annuity
and
has
no
election
or
choice
to
withdraw
and
he's
had
two
(inaudible)
or
he's
told
that
he
is
at
least
had
one
operation
for
cancer
and
he
maybe
under
a
fear
that
--
that
this
will
be
terminable,
the
pure,
simple
practical
aspects
of
it
touched
upon
the
salability
so
that
because
of
the
cash
values
which
developed,
the
nonforfeitures
which
developed,
the
practical
impact
to
make
this
saleable
the
company
had
to
give
to
a
policyholder
an
opportunity
to
withdraw.
but
it
gave
him
more,
it
gave
him
more,
it
gave
him
all
of
the
options
he
alone
can
withdraw.
the
company
cannot
withdraw.
the
company
is
obliged
from
the
day
they
entered
into
that
contract,
to
give
him
under
the
terms
of
that
contract,
so
long
as
he
lives
a
fixed
return
on
the
basis
of
the
money
credited
to
him
at
maturity.
now,
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
valic
case,
when
it
came
before
the
court,
the
basic
issue
was
decided
by
the
majority
as
we
read
it
and
as
chief
judge
bazelon
read
it
that
there
had
to
be
a
true
underwriting
of
risks
in
the
insurance
sense.
and
with
respect
to
that
particular
contract,
judge
bazelon
read
the
majority
opinion
as
saying
that
there
must
be
a
substantial
investment
risk
throughout
the
term
of
the
contract.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
any
reading
by
anyone
literally
will
--
you
will
find
in
the
opinion
itself
the
words
that
clearly
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
investment
undertaking,
but
i
think
it's
fair
also
to
read
the
case
in
the
terms
that
it
was
understood
that
what
risk
transfer
occurred
in
defining
the
federal
concept
of
insurance
had
to
be
a
meaningful
risk
transfer.
now,
the
language
itself
says
that
there
should
be
an
undertaking
to
pay
some
fraction
of
the
benefits
in
fixed
dollars.
the
language
says
that
there
must
be
some
return,
income
return.
and
the
language
says
there
must
be
some
investment
risk
taking
on
the
part
of
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
company.
and
it
said
here
in
valic,
there
is
no
such
thing.
all
you
have
really
is
an
undertaking
to
pay
whatever
the
value
of
that
portfolio
if
securities
may
be
and
nothing
has
been
shifted
from
the
policyholder
to
the
insurance
company
itself.
and
i
think
correctly
held
and
i
think
the
circ
--
third
circuit
correctly
held
that
both
the
prudential
case
and
the
valic
case
involving
security.
but
what
is
the
situation
in
this
case?
united
benefit
life
says
that
on
the
basis
of
the
payment
of
premiums
and
on
allocation
of
those
premiums
to
expense,
loading,
and
investment,
the
company
will
over
the
period
of
the
contract
undertake
to
guarantee
to
the
policyholder
a
percentage
of
the
net
premiums.
and
that
starts
in
the
first
year
with
50%
of
the
first
premium,
first
year's
premium,
and
it
goes
up
until
at
the
end
of
the
10th
year,
the
company
undertakes
to
guarantee
the
return
to
the
policyholder,
not
a
lot
or
little
or
nothing,
which
the
majority
held
was
the
undertaking
of
valic
but
a
lot
more
than
nothing,
what
chief
had
--
chief
judge
bazelon
referred
to
as
the
principal
of
the
policyholder,
his
principal
investment.
and
from
the
10th
year
forward,
that
company
is
obliged
to
carry
out
an
investment
policy
which
will
assure
regardless
of
what
happens
in
the
marketplace
that
that
policyholder
is
secure,
that
he
will
have
from
the
beginning
or
if
he
from
the
10th
year
on
into
the
20th
year
but
under
a
contractual
obligation
from
the
beginning,
the
undertaking
of
that
life
insurance
company
to
pay
him
so
long
as
he
lives,
so
long
as
he
lives,
a
lifetime
annuity
in
fixed
calculable
--
calculable
dollars,
calculable
under
the
contract,
under
the
clear
language
of
the
contract,
and
that
is
the
company's
basic
obligation
from
the
beginning.
we
believe
to
advert
to
it
again
that
to
take
this
contract
as
the
commission
must
do
and
try
to
push
over
on
the
side,
try
to
deprecate,
seek
to
ignore
the
basic
undertaking
of
that
company
to
pay
out
in
fixed
dollars
throughout
the
whole
term
of
the
--
after
the
maturity
of
that
--
of
the
contract
that
then,
that
man
takes
it
at
age
60
or
65
and
he
then
lives
to
be
90
or
a
hundred,
regardless,
the
company
is
obliged
to
pay
him
out
the
fixed
dollars
and
to
set
that
aside
and
say
that's
not
important
to
this
case
and
we
ask
this
court
to
ignore
it.
well,
they
ask
the
same
thing
as
chief
judge
bazelon,
his
view
was
in
the
opinion
in
the
court
below
that
with
respect
to
that
major
portion
of
the
contract,
we
assume
all
of
the
risk
and
with
respect
to
the
accumulation
period
in
the
contract
where
we
undertook
to
guarantee
after
ten
years
100%
of
the
net
premiums
he
said
that's
a
substantial
risk.
and
when
he
looked
at
the
whole
contract
as
we
urged
this
court
it
should
do
when
you
look
at
the
whole
contract,
i
think
that
you
can
conclude
as
chief
judge
bazelon
did,
that
we
assume
by
far
the
major
part
of
the
investment
risk.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
commission's
brief
at
page
36
and
37
although
they
said
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
thought
this
case
was
the
--
the
guidelines
in
the
valic
case
where
the
basis
on
which
the
decision
should
be
made
here,
you
will
find
at
page
36
and
37
an
indication
by
the
commission
that
deciding
these
problems
on
the
basis
of
allocation
of
risk,
is
not
a
satisfactory
mode
for
treating
the
problem
and
i
suppose
it's
quite
clear
that
what
the
commission
seeks
is
really
to
have
this
court
walk
away
from
those
tenets
which
were
laid
down
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
--
in
the
valic
opinion.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
i
distinguish
this
contract
from
what
you
can
get
from
a
mutual
fund
in
this
way
sir.
if
you
buy
a
contract
from
a
mutual
fund
and
it's
on
a
periodic
payment
basis
and
if
that
contract
at
the
end
of
ten
years
is
worth
50%
of
what
you
have
invested
as
net
premiums
then
all
you'll
get
is
the
market
value,
your
share
in
the
portfolio
of
those
securities,
whereas
under
this
contract,
this
company
has
guaranteed
to
return
100%
of
the
net
premiums
at
the
end
of
ten
years.
and
i
would
say
this
one
other
thing
sir
that
under
the
--
under
the
securities
law
and
under
the
common
law
i
would
think
that
when
you
buy
a
share
of
a
mutual
fund
whether
it's
a
massachusetts
investment
type
or
some
other
--
a
trust
type
or
some
other
trust
arrangement,
you
do
become
really
legally
under
federal
law
and
under
any
state
law
a
--
a,
an
owner
of
an
undivided
interest
in
the
whole
of
that
portfolio.
but
the
statute
in
the
state
of
--
of
nebraska
says
that
this
company
shall
be
the
owner,
the
company
under
the
state
law
is
the
owner.
it
says
also
that
the
company
shall
not
hold
itself
out
to
be
a
trustee.
so
that
as
--
as
the
state
of
nebraska
has
laid
the
ground
work
for
and
laid
down
in
the
statute
the
criteria
as
to
the
relationships
between
the
parties
that
at
least
in
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
and
in
so
far
as
the
basic
property
rights
of
the
parties
is
concerned
and
i
understand
clearly
that
the
majority
in
and
i
--
and
in
the
--
in
the
valic
case
took
the
view
that
it
was
insurance
under
this
statute
as
a
federal
concept.
well,
i
think
it's
not
without
meaning
to
point
out
that
the
state
law
and
the
basic
property
rights
between
the
parties
are
essentially
different
between
the
mutual
fund
and
between
the
policyholder,
that's
the
company
who
owns
it,
the
company
who
has
the
obligations.

time
the

brought
its

correct
in
17
states.
i'll
tell
you
frankly
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
sir?
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
there
are
states
--
we
do
not
concede
that
there
is
any
state
which
has
absolutely
refused.
there
are
some
states
which
have
ac
--
ask
for
additional
information
and
have
thrown
up
caveats
and
to
be
honest
with
you,
justice
fortas,
when
this
litigation
began,
the
company
through
--
with
the
counsel,
made
the
election
not
to
go
on
a
big
selling
program
because
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
not
in
the
brief
sir.
it
is
in
the
record,
i
believe,
in
an
answer
to
an
interrogatory.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
he
may,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
right
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
well,
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
i'm
sure
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
well,
that'd
be,
yes,
i
think
there
would
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
may
i
address
myself
to
that?
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
in
the
first
place,
the
accumulated
value
under
the
--
in
the
separate
account
is
itself
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
insurance
commission's
a
reserve.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
have
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
it's
a
reserve
against
the
--
company's
obligation
against
the
policy,
hen
the
obligation
under
the
policy.
mr.
daniel
j.

against
the
accumulated
value
if
it
exceeds
the
guaranteed
minimum.
mr.

yes

mr.

it
would
be

mr.

they

they
are
in
a
separate

which
the

carries
on

for
which
it
buys

as

i
want

mr.

no

about
that
at
all.
mr.
daniel

the
--
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
recently
had
a
form
1
which
was
used
to
--
for
the
annual
filing
of
reports
by
insurance
companies.
they're
filed
in
every
insurance
commissioner's
office
in
the
county
where
the
company
is
authorized
to
the
business
and
you
may
be
permitted
with
that.
that
form
has
been
amended.
and
attached
to
it
is
a
form
1s
to
cover
separate
account
business
and
it's
in
the
record
in
the
large
volume
and
as
exhibits
8a
and
8b
and
the
insurance
we
report
every
year
with
respect
to
our
separate
account
business
and
answer
all
the
questions
of
the
blanks
committee
of
the
naic
have
there,
and
then
of
course
we're
subject,
as
you
probably
know
sir,
to
the
triennial
examination
by
regional
representatives
of
the
national
association
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
the
control
is
set
up
first
in
the
state
law
that
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
have
--
we
have
to
--
the
only
exemption
we
have
from
the
state
law
with
respect
to
our
investment
is
that
under
the
law
for
our
as
it
was
prior
to
a
separate
account
statute.
under
the
law
we
can
only
invest
up
to
15%
in
commerce
act.
but
thereafter,
thereafter
we
are
entitled
now
--
about
entitled
to
invest
up
to
a
100%.
but
the
same
criteria
for
the
types
of
securities
that
can
be
used
with
respect
to
--
or
purchased
in
connection
with
this,
is
still
controlled
by
the
state
law.
and
this
is
important
to
the
company,
if
i
may
say
so,
because
if
i
--
if
i
am
a
--
an
investment
adviser
for
a
mutual
fund
and
i
don't
know
any
of
the
management
company
stock
on
which
i
can
make
up
profit
if
i
sell
it,
i
don't
care
what
happens,
i
can
have
any
kinds
as
long
as
i
fall
within
the
general
purview
of
that
investment
company's
statement
of
policy.
all
i
have
to
worry
about
is
buying
and
selling
securities
and
i
don't
care
whether
it
goes
up
or
down
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
is
there?
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
i
say
to
you
sir
that
there
is
uniformity
with
respect
to
the
form
1s
that
has
to
be
filed.
and
i
will
say
to
you
that
this
is
a
new
concept,
the
whole
thing
of
separate
accounts
whether
you
deal
in
group
business
or
in
individual
business
is
something
new
and
it's
the
insurance
industry
is
alive
to
this.
and
they're
keeping
on
top
of
it
and
they're
aggressively
going
forward
as
they
have
already.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
can't
--
i
can't
let
go
by
the
comments
with
--
with
that
comment
--
the
comments
with
respect
to
our
sales
literature.
i
don't
think
you
can
take
the
standard
annuity
and
i
was
suggesting
this
court
that
the
standard
annuity
which
everybody
can
see
as
in
the
exempt
annuity
and
if
you
put
out
sales
literature
and
say
it's
a
security,
that
that
makes
it
a
security.
and
i
think
what
the
--
i
know
what
the
court
will
do
as
is
fairly
read
and
not
just
take
the
excerpts
which
have
drawn
--
been
drawn
out
of
the
context
out
of
--
out
of
our
sales
literature
because
when
the
district
court
look
at
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
look
at
it,
you
will
find
in
that
sales
literature
had
substantial
emphasis
with
respect
to
the
guarantees,
with
respect
to
the
annuity
feature
of
this
contract,
and
after
all,
it
is
a
new
instrument,
it
is
a
new
type
instrument,
it
differs
from
what
we
have
been
selling
before
and
we
have
to
say
something
about
it,
and
what
we
have
said
about
it
is
that
it
is
does
--
does
present
an
opportunity
for
appreciation.
well,
in
summary,
if
the
court
pleases,
we
believe
that
in
our
brief
and
in
this
argument
the
emphasis
that
we
want
to
get
across
is
that
what
is
being
issued
here
is
a
document
which
is
the
document
and
the
undertaking
of
the
company
and
not
of
some
separate
fund.
the
guarantees
are
the
company's
guarantees.
the
need
for
the
so-called
protections
under
the
investment
company
act
for
shareholders
are
not
nearly
so
germane
here
as
they
were
in
valic
or
as
they
are
under
the
investment
company
act,
because
here,
the
company
should
have
control
of
it's
investment
policy
because
it
has
undertakings
which
it
must
meet
under
that
policy,
that
this
is
a
document
when
viewed
as
a
whole,
gives
guaranteed
fixed
dollars
throughout
the
life
of
the
annuitant
and
is
therefore
well
within
the
exemption
as
this
court
has
up
to
this
point
in
valic
to
find
insurance
in
the
federal
sense
and
is
it
may
further
extend
those
guidelines
in
this
case.
this
is
not
howey,
this
is
not
joiner
in
which
the
commission
has
relied
so
heavily
where
you
have
some
type
of
an
arrangement.
this
is
a
--
which,
which
you
--
you
really
don't
know,
you
take
the
whole
thing,
you
look
at
it,
and
you
say
it's
a
security.
here,
you
have
the
undertaking
of
an
insurance
company,
you
have
the
theory
under
the
law
that
insurance
within
the
statute
means
something,
you
don't
have
to
go
back
to
an
investment
contract,
in
the
broad
general
sense
under
what
is
a
security.
you
--
what
you
do,
if
you
will,
is
evaluate
what
is
insurance
under
the
exemption,
define
what
is
insurance,
if
it's
defined
as
it
has
been
by
the
majority
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
bazelon
in
which
he
said
that
if
you
view
this
undertaking
as
a
whole,
this
is
insurance
within
the
federal
sense
because
this
company
has
assumed
all
of
the
obligations
in
the
pay-out
period,
substantial
obligations
in
the
pay-in
period,
and
by
far
the
major
part
of
the
investment
risk
undertaking,
the
investment
risk
shifted
from
the
individual
just
as
you
shift
life
property
in
another
company.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
it's
our
intention
to
discuss
the
contract,
the
statute
under
which
there's
an
exemption,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
valic
case,
the
policy
considerations
involved
with
respect
to
state
and
federal
regulation
and
the
comparisons
of
values
and
what
actually
is
being
sold.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
so
far
as
i
know
sir,
there
are
no
such
bills.
mr.
loomis,
the
general
counsel
of
the
commission
is
here
and
he
would
know.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
the
approach
which
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
takes
through
the
solicitor
general
is
that
in
an
analysis
of
this
contract,
you
don't
take
the
four
corners
of
the
document
and
all
of
its
pages
and
the
view
what
is
the
basic
undertaking
and
what
is
the
basic
responsibility
of
the
company
and
what
are
they
selling
and
what
is
the
purchaser
getting.
but
the
--
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
prefers
to
take
the
contract
and
break
it
up
into
fragments
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out.
for
example,
the
commission
takes
the
position
that
with
respect
to
this
contract,
there
is
no
yield
and
yet
for
the
entire
period
after
maturity,
in
which
there
is
a
payment
of
guaranteed
fixed
dollars
to
the
annuitant,
there
is
a
yield
which
is
set
forth
in
the
contract.
then,
it
would
seemed
to
us
that
to
wipe
out
this
entire
phase
of
the
contract
which
is
--
requires
the
company
to
undertake
substantial
investment
undertakings,
tends
to
--
towards
superficiality
to
ignore
basically
what
are
the
obligations
of
the
company.
the
statute
covers
in
its
exemption
provisions
not
only
insurance
and
endowments
and
annuities,
but
the
statute
--
the
statute
also
covers
optional
annuities.
so
that
in
1933
when
the
securities
act
was
adopted,
the
congress
very
clearly
had
in
mind
the
whole
concept
of
an
optional
annuity.
now,
in
it's
brief,
the
commission,
and
in
it's
oral
argument
and
the
amici
in
the
brief
lend
considerable
time
to
emphasizing
the
possibility
that
a
purchaser
of
such
a
contract
is
in
a
position
to
withdraw,
to
withdraw
before
maturity,
to
withdraw
after
maturity,
or
at
maturity,
and
that
there
is
no
fixed
and
firm
obligation
to
take
the
annuity.
i
think
we
have
to
analyze
that.
i
think
that
the
argument
tends
to
give
the
impression
that
the
contract
ought
to
be
fragmentized.
i
think
the
argument
tends
to
give
credence
to
the
idea
that
there
are
really
two
relationships
here.
but
on
analysis,
i'm
considering
that
the
congress
understood
in
the
beginning
in
1933
when
they
gave
in
the
statute
an
exemption
for
an
optional
annuity
that
congress
understood
clearly
that
a
person
buying
such
a
contract
would
have
at
maturity
the
option
to
withdraw
or
the
option
to
take
the
annuity.
and
we
have
cited
to
the
court
in
our
brief,
text
material
by
maclean
on
this
in
the
addition
contemporaneous
with
the
adoption
of
the
securities
law.
the
basic
guarantee
which
is
here
in
this
contract
regardless
of
the
argument
about
the
brochure
which
is
used
is
that
what
is
being
sold
here
by
the
company
is
a
policy
covering
insurance
and
annuity
under
which
the
purchaser
has
the
obligation
in
undertaking
of
the
company
from
the
very
beginning
to
give
him
fixed
values
and
to
give
him
a
guaranteed
payout,
a
guaranteed
lifetime
income
and
fix
calculable
dollars
under
the
contract.
in
its
brief,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
takes
considerable
time
to
review
again
the
concepts
of
what
are
an
investment
con
--
what
is
an
investment
contract,
vis-Ã -vis
what
is
this
contract.
now,
if
i
may
again
bring
the
court's
mind
back
in
focus
to
the
fact
that
we
suggest
and
urge
that
the
whole
undertaking
has
to
be
reviewed.
but
just
for
the
purpose
of
analysis
look
to
what
the
gov
--
to
the
--
to
what
the
sec
said.
they
say
that
from
the
beginning,
there
is
here
a
so-called
mutual
fund
obligation
for
the
pay-in
period
of
the
contract.
they
say
that
the
guarantees
which
are
--
which
exist
here
are
insubstantial.
they
say
that
there
is
here
nothing
more
than
a
mutual
fund
for
this
part
of
the
design.
on
the
contrary,
if
you
examine
the
contract
that
has
been
issued
by
united
benefit
life
and
if
you
examine
another
exhibit
in
this
record
which
is
the
conventional
annuity
which
was
issued
by
united
benefit
life,
had
always
has
been
in
is
similar
in
form
to
the
conventional
annuity
that
other
companies
do
issue
in
which
there
is
clearly
a
yield,
an
undertaking
--
an
undertaking
to
invest
money
during
the
pay-in
period
on
a
guaranteed
interest
return
basis.
within
those
contracts
you
have
the
death
benefit
which
you
have
in
the
flexible
fund
annuity,
you
have
the
cash
value
which
is
present
in
the
flexible
fund
annuity,
and
really
you
don't
have
to
have
a
cash
value
to
make
an
annuity.
anyone
can
undertake
on
the
payment
of
my
--
of
my
payment
to
him
of
the
sum
of
money
by
the
application
of
actuarial
tables,
to
payout
that
money
to
me
for
as
long
as
i
live
and
maybe
end
up
with
a
profit
and
not
have
--
or
not
have
a
profit.
but
he
doesn't
have
to
invest
it,
the
mere
fact
that
he
would
pay
it
out
to
me
on
a
mortality
basis
is
really
the
essence
of
an
annuity
and
what
was
done
originally
when
annuities
were
first
written.
those
annuities
aren't
popular
today.
those
annuities
aren't
popular
because
people
came
to
realize
that
this
type
of
tontine
arrangement
without
them
having
an
opportunity
to
get
a
return
of
investment
was
not
a
valuable
economic
thing.
so
then
the
insurance
companies
had
to
move
to
another
type
of
investment
of
--
of
annuities,
one
which
gave
a
return,
one
which
appreciative
by
way
of
investment,
the
principle
which
had
been
paid
in
by
the
policyholder.
and
as
the
concept
in
life
insurance
developed
that
a
policy
of
insurance
should
have
cash
values
and
you
should
not
have
forfeitures
and
then
these
nonforfeiture
laws
were
develop
the
same
theory
was
applied
to
annuities
and
annuities
now
today,
for
the
most
part,
to
be
saleable
have
to
have
cash
values
over
the
period
of
time.
and
what
does
the
company
do
in
facing
to
the
fact
that
if
a
person
buys
an
annuity
at
age
30
or
at
age
35
and
he
comes
in
to
benefit
at
age
65,
and
if
he
has
to
take
--
if
he
has
to
take
the
annuity
and
has
no
election
or
choice
to
withdraw
and
he's
had
two
(inaudible)
or
he's
told
that
he
is
at
least
had
one
operation
for
cancer
and
he
maybe
under
a
fear
that
--
that
this
will
be
terminable,
the
pure,
simple
practical
aspects
of
it
touched
upon
the
salability
so
that
because
of
the
cash
values
which
developed,
the
nonforfeitures
which
developed,
the
practical
impact
to
make
this
saleable
the
company
had
to
give
to
a
policyholder
an
opportunity
to
withdraw.
but
it
gave
him
more,
it
gave
him
more,
it
gave
him
all
of
the
options
he
alone
can
withdraw.
the
company
cannot
withdraw.
the
company
is
obliged
from
the
day
they
entered
into
that
contract,
to
give
him
under
the
terms
of
that
contract,
so
long
as
he
lives
a
fixed
return
on
the
basis
of
the
money
credited
to
him
at
maturity.
now,
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
valic
case,
when
it
came
before
the
court,
the
basic
issue
was
decided
by
the
majority
as
we
read
it
and
as
chief
judge
bazelon
read
it
that
there
had
to
be
a
true
underwriting
of
risks
in
the
insurance
sense.
and
with
respect
to
that
particular
contract,
judge
bazelon
read
the
majority
opinion
as
saying
that
there
must
be
a
substantial
investment
risk
throughout
the
term
of
the
contract.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
any
reading
by
anyone
literally
will
--
you
will
find
in
the
opinion
itself
the
words
that
clearly
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
investment
undertaking,
but
i
think
it's
fair
also
to
read
the
case
in
the
terms
that
it
was
understood
that
what
risk
transfer
occurred
in
defining
the
federal
concept
of
insurance
had
to
be
a
meaningful
risk
transfer.
now,
the
language
itself
says
that
there
should
be
an
undertaking
to
pay
some
fraction
of
the
benefits
in
fixed
dollars.
the
language
says
that
there
must
be
some
return,
income
return.
and
the
language
says
there
must
be
some
investment
risk
taking
on
the
part
of
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
company.
and
it
said
here
in
valic,
there
is
no
such
thing.
all
you
have
really
is
an
undertaking
to
pay
whatever
the
value
of
that
portfolio
if
securities
may
be
and
nothing
has
been
shifted
from
the
policyholder
to
the
insurance
company
itself.
and
i
think
correctly
held
and
i
think
the
circ
--
third
circuit
correctly
held
that
both
the
prudential
case
and
the
valic
case
involving
security.
but
what
is
the
situation
in
this
case?
united
benefit
life
says
that
on
the
basis
of
the
payment
of
premiums
and
on
allocation
of
those
premiums
to
expense,
loading,
and
investment,
the
company
will
over
the
period
of
the
contract
undertake
to
guarantee
to
the
policyholder
a
percentage
of
the
net
premiums.
and
that
starts
in
the
first
year
with
50%
of
the
first
premium,
first
year's
premium,
and
it
goes
up
until
at
the
end
of
the
10th
year,
the
company
undertakes
to
guarantee
the
return
to
the
policyholder,
not
a
lot
or
little
or
nothing,
which
the
majority
held
was
the
undertaking
of
valic
but
a
lot
more
than
nothing,
what
chief
had
--
chief
judge
bazelon
referred
to
as
the
principal
of
the
policyholder,
his
principal
investment.
and
from
the
10th
year
forward,
that
company
is
obliged
to
carry
out
an
investment
policy
which
will
assure
regardless
of
what
happens
in
the
marketplace
that
that
policyholder
is
secure,
that
he
will
have
from
the
beginning
or
if
he
from
the
10th
year
on
into
the
20th
year
but
under
a
contractual
obligation
from
the
beginning,
the
undertaking
of
that
life
insurance
company
to
pay
him
so
long
as
he
lives,
so
long
as
he
lives,
a
lifetime
annuity
in
fixed
calculable
--
calculable
dollars,
calculable
under
the
contract,
under
the
clear
language
of
the
contract,
and
that
is
the
company's
basic
obligation
from
the
beginning.
we
believe
to
advert
to
it
again
that
to
take
this
contract
as
the
commission
must
do
and
try
to
push
over
on
the
side,
try
to
deprecate,
seek
to
ignore
the
basic
undertaking
of
that
company
to
pay
out
in
fixed
dollars
throughout
the
whole
term
of
the
--
after
the
maturity
of
that
--
of
the
contract
that
then,
that
man
takes
it
at
age
60
or
65
and
he
then
lives
to
be
90
or
a
hundred,
regardless,
the
company
is
obliged
to
pay
him
out
the
fixed
dollars
and
to
set
that
aside
and
say
that's
not
important
to
this
case
and
we
ask
this
court
to
ignore
it.
well,
they
ask
the
same
thing
as
chief
judge
bazelon,
his
view
was
in
the
opinion
in
the
court
below
that
with
respect
to
that
major
portion
of
the
contract,
we
assume
all
of
the
risk
and
with
respect
to
the
accumulation
period
in
the
contract
where
we
undertook
to
guarantee
after
ten
years
100%
of
the
net
premiums
he
said
that's
a
substantial
risk.
and
when
he
looked
at
the
whole
contract
as
we
urged
this
court
it
should
do
when
you
look
at
the
whole
contract,
i
think
that
you
can
conclude
as
chief
judge
bazelon
did,
that
we
assume
by
far
the
major
part
of
the
investment
risk.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
commission's
brief
at
page
36
and
37
although
they
said
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
thought
this
case
was
the
--
the
guidelines
in
the
valic
case
where
the
basis
on
which
the
decision
should
be
made
here,
you
will
find
at
page
36
and
37
an
indication
by
the
commission
that
deciding
these
problems
on
the
basis
of
allocation
of
risk,
is
not
a
satisfactory
mode
for
treating
the
problem
and
i
suppose
it's
quite
clear
that
what
the
commission
seeks
is
really
to
have
this
court
walk
away
from
those
tenets
which
were
laid
down
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
--
in
the
valic
opinion.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
i
distinguish
this
contract
from
what
you
can
get
from
a
mutual
fund
in
this
way
sir.
if
you
buy
a
contract
from
a
mutual
fund
and
it's
on
a
periodic
payment
basis
and
if
that
contract
at
the
end
of
ten
years
is
worth
50%
of
what
you
have
invested
as
net
premiums
then
all
you'll
get
is
the
market
value,
your
share
in
the
portfolio
of
those
securities,
whereas
under
this
contract,
this
company
has
guaranteed
to
return
100%
of
the
net
premiums
at
the
end
of
ten
years.
and
i
would
say
this
one
other
thing
sir
that
under
the
--
under
the
securities
law
and
under
the
common
law
i
would
think
that
when
you
buy
a
share
of
a
mutual
fund
whether
it's
a
massachusetts
investment
type
or
some
other
--
a
trust
type
or
some
other
trust
arrangement,
you
do
become
really
legally
under
federal
law
and
under
any
state
law
a
--
a,
an
owner
of
an
undivided
interest
in
the
whole
of
that
portfolio.
but
the
statute
in
the
state
of
--
of
nebraska
says
that
this
company
shall
be
the
owner,
the
company
under
the
state
law
is
the
owner.
it
says
also
that
the
company
shall
not
hold
itself
out
to
be
a
trustee.
so
that
as
--
as
the
state
of
nebraska
has
laid
the
ground
work
for
and
laid
down
in
the
statute
the
criteria
as
to
the
relationships
between
the
parties
that
at
least
in
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
and
in
so
far
as
the
basic
property
rights
of
the
parties
is
concerned
and
i
understand
clearly
that
the
majority
in
and
i
--
and
in
the
--
in
the
valic
case
took
the
view
that
it
was
insurance
under
this
statute
as
a
federal
concept.
well,
i
think
it's
not
without
meaning
to
point
out
that
the
state
law
and
the
basic
property
rights
between
the
parties
are
essentially
different
between
the
mutual
fund
and
between
the
policyholder,
that's
the
company
who
owns
it,
the
company
who
has
the
obligations.

united

well
within

of

mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
we
are
entitled
to
sell
--
and
we're
entitled
to
sell
this
contract
at
the
time
the
sec
brought
its
action
in
four
states.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
and
it
had
been
approved
at
that
time
if
my
recollection
is
right
--
correct
in
17
states.
i'll
tell
you
frankly
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
sir?
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
there
are
states
--
we
do
not
concede
that
there
is
any
state
which
has
absolutely
refused.
there
are
some
states
which
have
ac
--
ask
for
additional
information
and
have
thrown
up
caveats
and
to
be
honest
with
you,
justice
fortas,
when
this
litigation
began,
the
company
through
--
with
the
counsel,
made
the
election
not
to
go
on
a
big
selling
program
because
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
not
in
the
brief
sir.
it
is
in
the
record,
i
believe,
in
an
answer
to
an
interrogatory.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
he
may,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
right
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
well,
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
i'm
sure
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
well,
that'd
be,
yes,
i
think
there
would
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
may
i
address
myself
to
that?
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
in
the
first
place,
the
accumulated
value
under
the
--
in
the
separate
account
is
itself
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
insurance
commission's
a
reserve.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
have
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
it's
a
reserve
against
the
--
company's
obligation
against
the
policy,
hen
the
obligation
under
the
policy.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
against
the
accumulated
value
if
it
exceeds
the
guaranteed
minimum.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
the
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
it
would
be
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
they
--
they
are
in
a
separate
account
which
the
company
carries
on
its
books
and
for
which
it
buys
investments
just
as
advised
every
other
investment
in
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
i
want
to
get
back
to
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
no
question
about
that
at
all.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
it's
in
a
separate
account,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
the
--
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
recently
had
a
form
1
which
was
used
to
--
for
the
annual
filing
of
reports
by
insurance
companies.
they're
filed
in
every
insurance
commissioner's
office
in
the
county
where
the
company
is
authorized
to
the
business
and
you
may
be
permitted
with
that.
that
form
has
been
amended.
and
attached
to
it
is
a
form
1s
to
cover
separate
account
business
and
it's
in
the
record
in
the
large
volume
and
as
exhibits
8a
and
8b
and
the
insurance
we
report
every
year
with
respect
to
our
separate
account
business
and
answer
all
the
questions
of
the
blanks
committee
of
the
naic
have
there,
and
then
of
course
we're
subject,
as
you
probably
know
sir,
to
the
triennial
examination
by
regional
representatives
of
the
national
association
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
the
control
is
set
up
first
in
the
state
law
that
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
have
--
we
have
to
--
the
only
exemption
we
have
from
the
state
law
with
respect
to
our
investment
is
that
under
the
law
for
our
as
it
was
prior
to
a
separate
account
statute.
under
the
law
we
can
only
invest
up
to
15%
in
commerce
act.
but
thereafter,
thereafter
we
are
entitled
now
--
about
entitled
to
invest
up
to
a
100%.
but
the
same
criteria
for
the
types
of
securities
that
can
be
used
with
respect
to
--
or
purchased
in
connection
with
this,
is
still
controlled
by
the
state
law.
and
this
is
important
to
the
company,
if
i
may
say
so,
because
if
i
--
if
i
am
a
--
an
investment
adviser
for
a
mutual
fund
and
i
don't
know
any
of
the
management
company
stock
on
which
i
can
make
up
profit
if
i
sell
it,
i
don't
care
what
happens,
i
can
have
any
kinds
as
long
as
i
fall
within
the
general
purview
of
that
investment
company's
statement
of
policy.
all
i
have
to
worry
about
is
buying
and
selling
securities
and
i
don't
care
whether
it
goes
up
or
down
--
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
is
there?
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
i
say
to
you
sir
that
there
is
uniformity
with
respect
to
the
form
1s
that
has
to
be
filed.
and
i
will
say
to
you
that
this
is
a
new
concept,
the
whole
thing
of
separate
accounts
whether
you
deal
in
group
business
or
in
individual
business
is
something
new
and
it's
the
insurance
industry
is
alive
to
this.
and
they're
keeping
on
top
of
it
and
they're
aggressively
going
forward
as
they
have
already.
mr.
daniel
j.
mccauley,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
can't
--
i
can't
let
go
by
the
comments
with
--
with
that
comment
--
the
comments
with
respect
to
our
sales
literature.
i
don't
think
you
can
take
the
standard
annuity
and
i
was
suggesting
this
court
that
the
standard
annuity
which
everybody
can
see
as
in
the
exempt
annuity
and
if
you
put
out
sales
literature
and
say
it's
a
security,
that
that
makes
it
a
security.
and
i
think
what
the
--
i
know
what
the
court
will
do
as
is
fairly
read
and
not
just
take
the
excerpts
which
have
drawn
--
been
drawn
out
of
the
context
out
of
--
out
of
our
sales
literature
because
when
the
district
court
look
at
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
look
at
it,
you
will
find
in
that
sales
literature
had
substantial
emphasis
with
respect
to
the
guarantees,
with
respect
to
the
annuity
feature
of
this
contract,
and
after
all,
it
is
a
new
instrument,
it
is
a
new
type
instrument,
it
differs
from
what
we
have
been
selling
before
and
we
have
to
say
something
about
it,
and
what
we
have
said
about
it
is
that
it
is
does
--
does
present
an
opportunity
for
appreciation.
well,
in
summary,
if
the
court
pleases,
we
believe
that
in
our
brief
and
in
this
argument
the
emphasis
that
we
want
to
get
across
is
that
what
is
being
issued
here
is
a
document
which
is
the
document
and
the
undertaking
of
the
company
and
not
of
some
separate
fund.
the
guarantees
are
the
company's
guarantees.
the
need
for
the
so-called
protections
under
the
investment
company
act
for
shareholders
are
not
nearly
so
germane
here
as
they
were
in
valic
or
as
they
are
under
the
investment
company
act,
because
here,
the
company
should
have
control
of
it's
investment
policy
because
it
has
undertakings
which
it
must
meet
under
that
policy,
that
this
is
a
document
when
viewed
as
a
whole,
gives
guaranteed
fixed
dollars
throughout
the
life
of
the
annuitant
and
is
therefore
well
within
the
exemption
as
this
court
has
up
to
this
point
in
valic
to
find
insurance
in
the
federal
sense
and
is
it
may
further
extend
those
guidelines
in
this
case.
this
is
not
howey,
this
is
not
joiner
in
which
the
commission
has
relied
so
heavily
where
you
have
some
type
of
an
arrangement.
this
is
a
--
which,
which
you
--
you
really
don't
know,
you
take
the
whole
thing,
you
look
at
it,
and
you
say
it's
a
security.
here,
you
have
the
undertaking
of
an
insurance
company,
you
have
the
theory
under
the
law
that
insurance
within
the
statute
means
something,
you
don't
have
to
go
back
to
an
investment
contract,
in
the
broad
general
sense
under
what
is
a
security.
you
--
what
you
do,
if
you
will,
is
evaluate
what
is
insurance
under
the
exemption,
define
what
is
insurance,
if
it's
defined
as
it
has
been
by
the
majority
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
bazelon
in
which
he
said
that
if
you
view
this
undertaking
as
a
whole,
this
is
insurance
within
the
federal
sense
because
this
company
has
assumed
all
of
the
obligations
in
the
pay-out
period,
substantial
obligations
in
the
pay-in
period,
and
by
far
the
major
part
of
the
investment
risk
undertaking,
the
investment
risk
shifted
from
the
individual
just
as
you
shift
life
property
in
another
company.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
