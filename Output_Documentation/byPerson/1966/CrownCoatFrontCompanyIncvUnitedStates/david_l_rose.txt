mr.
david
l.
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
has
already
heard,
there's
only
one
question
here
and
that
is
whether
the
suit
is
timely.
analytically
however,
it
breaks
down
into
as
we
see
at
two
points.
the
first
is
on
the
suits
with
the
standard
disputes
clauses,
when
does
the
cause
of
action
accrue
and
the
second
point
is
if
as
all
the
judges
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
ruled,
it
accrues
on
the
final
delivery
date
that
is
completion
of
the
work
in
the
contract
whether
a
tolling
provision
is
to
be
implied
into
the
tucker
act
statute
of
limitations.
it's
our
position
of
course
that
the
cause
of
action
does
accrue
when
the
breach
of
the
contractual
duty
occurred.
in
this
case,
that's
in
october
or
november
of
1956
when
the
test
which
petitioner
alleges
are
--
were
improper,
were
made
as
the
materials
then
rejected.
this
is
the
view
that's
been
adapted
by
the
second
circuit.
the
court
of
claims'
counsel
has
indicated
has
subsequent
to
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari
recently
held
that
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
accrue
at
all
until
the
final
administrative
determination.
and
the
third
circuit
has
taken
the
tolling
position.
that
is
the
third
circuit
holds
and
accrues
at
the
time
of
the
breach
but
at
the
period
in
which
the
claim
is
under
submission.
administratively,
it's
taken
out
its
toll
during
that
period.
just
for
the
court's
convenience,
i
would
like
to
recall
the
basic
chronology
here.
the
contract
was
executed
in
may
of
1956.
the
laboratory
tests
were
conducted
in
october
--
of
november
1956
and
november
--
from
november
8th
to
december
4th,
four
change
orders
were
entered
into
reducing
the
price
of
the
canteen
covers.
i
have
sent
a
cover
to
reflect
the
fact
that
they
didn't
need
specifications
and
final
delivery
of
all
--
and
all
the
work
of
the
contract
was
completed
on
december
14,
1956.
this
claim
was
first
filed
administratively
on
october
04,
1961
almost
five
years
later,
approximate.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
your
honor.
there
was
another
claim
pending
administratively
which
was
later
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
by
the
board,
by
the
aspca.
so
the
claim
was
filed
here
administratively
on
october
4,
1961.
on
january
29th,
the
contractor
wrote
to
--
to
the
contracting
officer
saying
he
thought
the
positions
were
reconcilable
as
for
findings.
the
contracting
officer
made
those
findings
in
february
21,
1962.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
board.
there
was
a
trial-type
hearing
in
october
of
1962,
briefs
were
submitted
and
the
final
decision
of
the
board
was
on
february
28,
1963
as
counsel
has
indicated
and
this
suit
was
not
filed
until
july
31,
1963.
mr.
david
l.
rose
31,
1963,
almost
seven
years,
six
years
and
approximately
nine
months
after
the
final
delivery.
in
considering
the
various
views,
i
would
like
to
note
at
the
outset
something
that's
common
to
both
our
positions.
we
think
it's
only
our
view
that
is
that
cause
accrues
at
the
time
of
the
breach
of
duty
and
that
it's
not
tolled,
it's
only
this
view
that
provides
incentives
for
prompt
and
diligent
prosecution
of
the
claims
by
government
contractors
on
this
kind
of
a
contract.
either
of
the
other
two
views
would
require
the
government
to
defend
at
least
in
some
circumstances
staled
claims
in
which
memories
had
become
dim
and
records
lost
and
witnesses
disappeared.
whereas
this
court
held
in
the
utah
construction
case
last
term,
these
contract
cases
involved
not
only
claims
arising
under
the
contract
which
are
within
the
ambit
of
the
disputes
clause
but
also
the
so-called
breach
claims.
and
one
of
the
typical
and
perhaps
the
classical
type
of
breach
claim
--
claim
is
the
so-called
delay
claim
and
that
is
something
that
we
have
here.
this
contract
is
asking
not
only
for
an
equitable
adjustment
but
it's
also
asking
for
damages
due
to
the
delay
and
while
this
point
was
not
articulated
particularly
in
the
courts
below,
it
strikes
me
as
being
sort
of
the
classical
kind
of
delay
claim
in
which
the
contract
would
be
entitled
to
trial
de
novo
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
claims
where
--
where
he
brought
the
suit.
and
so
you
would
have
as
the
results
here
if
you
took
either
of
the
other
two
positions,
cases
in
the
late
suit
being
filed
are
tried
in
the
late
1960s
in
regard
to
claims
that
--
actually
facts
that
actually
occurred
in
--
in
1956
and
we
don't
think
this
is
what
congress
intended
and
we
don't
think
that
that's
what
this
court
should
hold.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
accrual
point
which
counsel
has
addressed
himself
to
primarily
and
then
to
the
tolling
point.
it's
our
position
that
the
cause
of
action
accrues
as
mr.
justice
douglas
indicated
in
the
unexcelled
chemical
corporation
case.
when
the
breach
of
duty
occurs,
not
when
that
breach
is
--
is
discovered.
here,
and
this
is
a
--
a
sort
of
a
typical
case.
we
have
performance
in
1956.
the
breach
occurred.
we
think
the
alleged
breach
when
the
laboratory
test
were
made
which
was
october
and
november
1956
and
certainly
no
later
than
after
that
was
arranged
by
a
change
order
can
affect
compromise,
certainly
no
later
than
the
goods
were
delivered
and
the
work
was
performed
so
that
the
payment
was
due.
the
opposing
position
is
that
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
accrue
until
after
the
final
administrative
determination.
that's
the
position
that
the
court
of
claims
has
recently
taken
in
the
nager
electric
case.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
in
our
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
in
our
view,
the
result
would
be
the
same
as
if
--
as
if
it
was
here.
in
this
case
of
course,
the
only
trouble
was
cause
because
the
claim
was
filed
so
late
administratively
but
in
theory,
as
far
as
the
operation
of
the
statute,
we
think
that
it
--
it
runs
from
the
time
there's
a
breach
of
the
duty.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
that's
the
--
the
factual
situation
we
have
here
as
we
conceded.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
filing
here
was
late.
it
was
almost
five
years
after
the
--
the
claim
accrue
but
there
wasn't
any
administrative
decision
here
until
after
the
six
years
had
run
on
our
--
on
our
theory
and
our
view
is
that
that
--
let
me
point
this
out.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
we
say
your
honor,
if
they
filed
it
and
the
administrative
agency
has
not
decided,
they're
free
to
file
a
protective
claim
--
a
protective
suit
and
that's
what
the
court
of
the
second
circuit
held
as
early
as
1960
and
indeed
the
southern
district
in
new
york
held
as
early
as
1955.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
and
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
the
government
does
on
the
other
side
in
the
walsh-healey
act
situation
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
on
unexcelled
chemical
and
unexcelled
chemical
is
a
two-year
statute
limitations.
the
proceeding
in
the
court
is
on
the
administrative
record.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
that
the
cause
of
action
accrue
at
the
time
of
the
breach
of
duty
and
that
is
not
tolled
--
there
is
no
tolling
involved
in
this
court's
decision
and
the
result
is
that
in
those
instances,
when
the
administrative
decision
is
not
made
within
the
two-year
period
in
that
statute,
a
protective
suit
is
filed.
let
me
point
out
that
this
is
a
very,
very
rare
animal
that
we
have
here,
this
--
this
situation.
we
have
looked
for
a
tucker
act
suit
in
which
the
statute
of
limitations
was
urged,
which
the
administrative
determination
was
not
made
within
the
six
years
and
we
have
found
none
at
the
appellate
level
until
this
very
case
that
is
in
all
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
government
contracts
that
we
have.
this
case
is
the
very
first
one
involving
the
six-year
tucker
act
statute
of
limitations
in
which
the
administrative
proceedings
have
not
been
terminated
within
the
six-year
period
and
the
reason
for
that,
i
think
is
clear.
we've
indicated
in
our
briefs
in
the
utah
case
and
the
grace
case
last
year
and
we've
repeated
again
this
year,
the
average
time
before
decisions
is
roughly
11
months
and
the
result
is
that
contractors
--
certainly
those
who
wish
to
do
so
are
--
are
almost
without
exception,
able
to
get
the
claim
heard
and
decided
very,
very
promptly
after
it's
been
filed.
so
this
is
a
very
unusual
situation
and
we
think,
the
facts
of
this
case
explain
why
it's
come
up
this
way,
the
facts
of
this
case
indicated
the
claim
wasn't
filed
administratively
until
almost
five
years
so
that
most
of
the
six-year
period
was
used
up
before
the
claim
was
filed.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no
sir.
the
case
decided
in
the
second
circuit's
decision
show
that
we've
been
urging
it
right
along.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
he
was
right
in
regard
with
the
particular
case,
your
honor.
in
nager
electric,
there
was
a
change
of
view
but
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
in
the
government's
position,
in
the
court
of
claims,
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
david
l.
rose
the
statute
of
limitations
was
urged
only
on
the
breach
claims
initially
as
i
understand
it,
and
it
was
later
that
it
was
urged
on
the
whole
--
to
bar
the
whole
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
i
think
that
--
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i'll
quote
you
from
a
court
of
claims
decision
in
1942
which
i
think
is
fairly
--
or
1937
that's
fairly
typical
court
of
claims
holdings
at
that
period
of
time
and
this
is
a
case
that
was
quoted
and
cited
by
the
second
circuit
in
its
decision,
pink
liquidated
versus
united
states.
this
is
what
the
court
of
claims
has
said.
the
time
is
not
suspended
during
the
period
of
his
claims
reimbursement
under
the
contractor
being
considered
and
passed
upon
by
the
government
officials.
it's
been
repeatedly
held
by
this
court
that
under
contract
to
perform
work,
the
completion
and
acceptance,
they
start
the
statute
to
run.
now
there
was
--
that
particular
case
do
not
have
a
disputes
clause
in
it,
a
case
that
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
but
the
case
that
it's
cited
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
your
honor,
he
said
that
the
court
had
said
repeatedly,
it's
stated
repeatedly.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
of
those
cases
that
he
cites,
only
two
of
them
involve
disputes
claims,
disputes
clause
actions.
and
i
believe
both
of
them,
certainly
at
least
one
of
them
involve
the
holding
of
the
statute
--
that
the
statute
of
limitations
run,
they
both
were
dictum,
there's
never
been
a
holding
in
the
court
of
claims
prior
the
nager
electric
--
along
the
lines
of
nager
electric.
mr.
david
l.
rose
as
to
when
it
--
when
it
accrues.
mr.
david
l.
rose
on
either
your
honor,
there's
no
holdings
and
judge
davis
doesn't
suggest
to
run
any
holdings
prior
to
that.
he
says
that
the
--
there's
language
prior
to
that.
we
point
out
to
our
brief
--
in
our
brief
that
there
is
language
both
ways
in
the
court
of
claims
decisions.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
i
think
there's
a
breach
and
if
your
honor
recalls
the
statute
that
we
have
here
says
when
the
--
when
the
cause
of
action
first
accrues,
we
think
there's
certainly
been
a
breach
of
duty
in
this
case
when
the
original
underlying
violation
occurred
and
that
the
cause
of
action
first
accrued
then.
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh
no,
no,
no.
that's
not
the
problem
we
have
here.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
--
i
think
perhaps
in
the
change,
there
may
be
situations
where
your
honor
is
correct.
i
think
that
the
usual
situation,
the
one
that
we
have
here
is
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
some
duty
on
--
on
the
part
of
--
of
the
government
and
the
performance
to
the
contract
and
certainly
has
to
look
at
the
--
at
the
analytical
--
we
have
to
analyze
the
situation
in
the
case,
but
here,
the
alleged
breach
of
duty
is
the
so-called
improper
testing
and
that
occurred
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
i
think
the
--
the
duty
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
i
think
your
honor,
the
--
the
rule
that's
been
adapted
by
the
court
of
claims
and
(inaudible)
--
it
covers
this
situation
because
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
talking
about
the
--
about
the
earlier
rule,
the
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
the
rule
it
says
delivery
because
if
you've
completed
work
on
the
contract
and
you've
made
delivery,
you've
done
everything
that
you
need
to
in
order
to
get
paid
and
if
you
haven't
been
paid
then
--
then
the
breach
of
duty
has
already
occurred.
mr.
david
l.
rose
so
i
think
the
breach
of
duty
occurs
at
the
times
the
work
has
been
performed.
there
may
be
some
rare
situations
that
are
--
that
--
where
this
is
not
so
but
the
--
certainly
the
usual
case
and
certainly
this
case
is
one
of
which
the
alleged
breach
of
duty
takes
place
during
the
period
of
contractual
performance.
now
if
your
honors
will
recall
the
--
the
nature
of
this
lawsuit
is
a
suit
on
the
contract,
it's
not
a
suit
for
review
of
the
administrative
decision
alone.
it's
not
--
that's
not
the
nature
of
the
suit.
this
is
sued
on
the
contract
under
the
tucker
act.
that's
confirmed
by
the
fact
--
by
the
court's
recent
decision
in
utah
that
these
suits
involved
breach
claims
as
well
as
claims
that
are
covered
by
the
disputes
clause.
so
that
this
is
--
if
this
was
a
suit
for
simply
--
for
review
of
the
administrative
decision,
congress
would
probably
have
provided
a
60
or
90-day
period
of
--
of
statute
of
limitations
but
that's
not
what
it's
done.
it's
provided
the
six-year,
the
conditional
contract,
statute
of
limitations
and
this
six-year
period
example
to
encompass
all
the
administrative
proceedings
and
the
overwhelming
majority
cases.
the
two
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
which
we
think
refute
judge
davis'
position
in
the
court
of
claims
are
mcmahon
and
unexcelled
chemical.
the
mcmahon
case,
there
was
a
statutory
requirement,
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
this
court
nevertheless
held
that
the
cause
of
action
accrued
when
the
breach
occurred.
that
was
the
tort
type
duty
that
was
in
the
seaman's
claim
for
unseaworthiness
and
negligence
and
the
court
held
notwithstanding
the
--
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
statute
required
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
the
cause
of
action
accrued
at
the
time
of
the
breach
of
duty
and
we
think
the
same
as
true
here.
and
unexcelled
chemical
was
the
government's
suit
on
behalf
of
underpaid
employees
under
the
walsh-healey
act
and
there
too,
the
court
held
that
the
cause
of
action
was
created
when
the
breach
of
duty
occurred
and
there
too
your
honor,
the
exhaustion
was
a
prerequisite.
now
judge
davis
says
that
it
wasn't,
but
the
statute
there
requires
the
secretary
of
labor
to
hold
the
hearing
and
forbids
them
from
recovering
on
it
unless
there's
been
an
administrative
hearing,
and
that's
the
stronger
case
for
holding
the
cause
of
action
didn't
accrue
because
there,
the
suit
is
only
on
the
administrative
record.
in
here,
we
have
both
this
--
the
part
of
the
suit
that's
on
the
administrative
record
and
the
part
that
involves
the
breach
claims.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
that's
what
the
court
of
claims
has
held
and
we
think
they're
probably
right
because
of
the
rule
by
not
splitting
causes
of
action.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
as
far
as
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
no.
certainly,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
make
the
result
that
we
have
here
under
nager.
if
we
had
--
if
we
brought
that
result
to
this
factual
situation,
you'd
have
a
lawsuit
12,
14,
16
years
after
the
fact
in
which
you're
trying
the
facts
de
novo.
we
don't
think
that
makes
any
sense
at
all.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
think
that
as
much
--
we
have
these
two
advantages,
your
honor,
if
a
protective
suit
is
filed.
we
would
know
what
the
breach
claim
was
and
so
that
the
government
would
be
able
to
protect
its
records
in
which
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
but
the
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
the
breach
claim
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
the
breach
claim,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
asserted
administratively.
the
so-called
breach
claim
under
the
--
under
the
utah
distinction,
the
delay
damage
is
that
sort
of
thing.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
asserted
so
the
government
may
never
know
what
that
is
until
the
lawsuit
is
filed.
we
have
that
and
we
also
have
the
thought
that
if
a
case
has
been
pending
administratively
for
a
long
time,
the
court
can
exercise
supervision
to
make
--
but
hasn't
been
brought
to
a
head
prior
that
time,
it
can
certainly
exercise
supervision
to
see
that
it
does.
so
we
don't
think
that
answer
would
be
the
same
even
if
they're
a
protective
suit.
i
point
out
that
the
protective
suit
is
the
very
rare
situation.
the
only
other
appellate
decisions
that
we've
had
prior
to
this
time
and
it's
been
on
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
where
there
is
only
a
two-year
statute
and
there
have
been
a
few
instances
when
the
period
of
the
statute
--
when
the
period
of
limitations
was
--
the
administrative
proceedings
were
not
ended
within
that
two-year
statute,
but
this
is
the
very
first
case
which
we
have
been
able
to
find
at
the
appellate
level
in
which
the
six-year
statute
is
--
in
which
the
administrative
decision
was
not
over
within
the
six-year
period.
now
as
far
as
the
tolling
provision
is
concern,
the
northern
metal
situation,
i
point
out
first
that
the
statute
that
we
have
here
provides
for
tolling
in
some
situations.
it
provides
for
tolling,
for
persons
under
a
legal
disability
or
beyond
the
seas
at
the
time
the
claim
accrues.
mr.
david
l.
rose
incompetency
your
honor,
minority
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
that's
what
it
--
that's
the
way
it
was
written
originally
and
that's
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
no
sir.
we
don't
say
it's
just
entitled
to
sue
--
the
--
i
think
the
situation
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
the
situation
is
like
it
was
in
unexcelled
chemical
and
it's
like
it
was
in
the
primary
jurisdiction
cases,
your
honor,
where
the
deference
required
here
to
the
contract
in
the
primary
jurisdiction
cases
to
the
expertise
of
the
agency
requires
the
court
to
hold
its
hands
until
the
administrator
has
decided,
but
suit
is
permitted
prior
that
time
and
certainly,
suit
is
permitted
on
the
breach
claims.
mr.
david
l.
rose
in
the
contract,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
the
disputes
clause
and
it
says
that
the
claim
shall
be
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
believe
it's
at
page
two
or
three
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
starts
at
page
three,
three
and
four.
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh,
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
it's
page
two.
the
statute
is
set
forth
on
in
full
at
page
two.
the
action
of
any
person
under
legal
disability
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
now
i
point
out
that
congress
where
it
has
wished
to
provide
for
tolling
has
done
so
expressly
such
as
in
the
maritime
contracts
for
war
risk
insurance,
claims
for
veteran
insurance,
the
tort
claims
act
and
so
forth.
and
indeed
a
statute
will
just
pass
this
very
year
involves
--
puts
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
government
for
its
affirmative
suits
and
that
provides
for
six-year
period
of
limitations
but
only
for
one
year.
it's
extensive
for
one
year
after
the
final
administrative
decision
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
in
the
case
that
they
were
kind
of
fighting
final
decisions
under
disputes
clause,
so
that
congress
has
had
these
things
in
mind
and
as
well
we're
about
to
take
care
of
it.
the
legislative
history
of
the
wunderlich
act,
i
suggest
that
congress
was
confronted
with
the
problem
almost
identical
to
the
one
we
have
here
and
that
it
wished
to
leave
the
government
entitled
or
with
the
exist
--
preexisting
protections.
if
the
court
will
refer
to
page
27
of
the
brief,
we've
set
out
the
relevant
portion
of
the
house
report.
mr.
david

yes.
the
court
--
the
--
this
is
the
house
report.
mr.
david

yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
your
honor,
i
--
we're
not
suggesting
there's
no
review.
we're
suggesting
that
what
the
contractor
should
do
that
this
doesn't
arise
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh,
i'd
say
that
if
he
didn't
file
a
suit
within
six
years,
congress
intended
to
bar
it,
that's
what
the
statute
says.
it
says
every
action
shall
be
barred
unless
filed
within
six
years.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor,
i'll
refer
you
to
this
paragraph
i
was
just
quoting
(inaudible)
from
page
27,
this
is
the
house
report.
mr.
david
l.
rose
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
has
already
heard,
there's
only
one
question
here
and
that
is
whether
the
suit
is
timely.
analytically
however,
it
breaks
down
into
as
we
see
at
two
points.
the
first
is
on
the
suits
with
the
standard
disputes
clauses,
when
does
the
cause
of
action
accrue
and
the
second
point
is
if
as
all
the
judges
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
ruled,
it
accrues
on
the
final
delivery
date
that
is
completion
of
the
work
in
the
contract
whether
a
tolling
provision
is
to
be
implied
into
the
tucker
act
statute
of
limitations.
it's
our
position
of
course
that
the
cause
of
action
does
accrue
when
the
breach
of
the
contractual
duty
occurred.
in
this
case,
that's
in
october
or
november
of
1956
when
the
test
which
petitioner
alleges
are
--
were
improper,
were
made
as
the
materials
then
rejected.
this
is
the
view
that's
been
adapted
by
the
second
circuit.
the
court
of
claims'
counsel
has
indicated
has
subsequent
to
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari
recently
held
that
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
accrue
at
all
until
the
final
administrative
determination.
and
the
third
circuit
has
taken
the
tolling
position.
that
is
the
third
circuit
holds
and
accrues
at
the
time
of
the
breach
but
at
the
period
in
which
the
claim
is
under
submission.
administratively,
it's
taken
out
its
toll
during
that
period.
just
for
the
court's
convenience,
i
would
like
to
recall
the
basic
chronology
here.
the
contract
was
executed
in
may
of
1956.
the
laboratory
tests
were
conducted
in
october
--
of
november
1956
and
november
--
from
november
8th
to
december
4th,
four
change
orders
were
entered
into
reducing
the
price
of
the
canteen
covers.
i
have
sent
a
cover
to
reflect
the
fact
that
they
didn't
need
specifications
and
final
delivery
of
all
--
and
all
the
work
of
the
contract
was
completed
on
december
14,
1956.
this
claim
was
first
filed
administratively
on
october
04,
1961
almost
five
years
later,
approximate.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
your
honor.
there
was
another
claim
pending
administratively
which
was
later
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
by
the
board,
by
the
aspca.
so
the
claim
was
filed
here
administratively
on
october
4,
1961.
on
january
29th,
the
contractor
wrote
to
--
to
the
contracting
officer
saying
he
thought
the
positions
were
reconcilable
as
for
findings.
the
contracting
officer
made
those
findings
in
february
21,
1962.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
board.
there
was
a
trial-type
hearing
in
october
of
1962,
briefs
were
submitted
and
the
final
decision
of
the
board
was
on
february
28,
1963
as
counsel
has
indicated
and
this
suit
was
not
filed
until
july
31,
1963.
mr.
david
l.
rose
31,
1963,
almost
seven
years,
six
years
and
approximately
nine
months
after
the
final
delivery.
in
considering
the
various
views,
i
would
like
to
note
at
the
outset
something
that's
common
to
both
our
positions.
we
think
it's
only
our
view
that
is
that
cause
accrues
at
the
time
of
the
breach
of
duty
and
that
it's
not
tolled,
it's
only
this
view
that
provides
incentives
for
prompt
and
diligent
prosecution
of
the
claims
by
government
contractors
on
this
kind
of
a
contract.
either
of
the
other
two
views
would
require
the
government
to
defend
at
least
in
some
circumstances
staled
claims
in
which
memories
had
become
dim
and
records
lost
and
witnesses
disappeared.
whereas
this
court
held
in
the
utah
construction
case
last
term,
these
contract
cases
involved
not
only
claims
arising
under
the
contract
which
are
within
the
ambit
of
the
disputes
clause
but
also
the
so-called
breach
claims.
and
one
of
the
typical
and
perhaps
the
classical
type
of
breach
claim
--
claim
is
the
so-called
delay
claim
and
that
is
something
that
we
have
here.
this
contract
is
asking
not
only
for
an
equitable
adjustment
but
it's
also
asking
for
damages
due
to
the
delay
and
while
this
point
was
not
articulated
particularly
in
the
courts
below,
it
strikes
me
as
being
sort
of
the
classical
kind
of
delay
claim
in
which
the
contract
would
be
entitled
to
trial
de
novo
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
claims
where
--
where
he
brought
the
suit.
and
so
you
would
have
as
the
results
here
if
you
took
either
of
the
other
two
positions,
cases
in
the
late
suit
being
filed
are
tried
in
the
late
1960s
in
regard
to
claims
that
--
actually
facts
that
actually
occurred
in
--
in
1956
and
we
don't
think
this
is
what
congress
intended
and
we
don't
think
that
that's
what
this
court
should
hold.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
accrual
point
which
counsel
has
addressed
himself
to
primarily
and
then
to
the
tolling
point.
it's
our
position
that
the
cause
of
action
accrues
as
mr.
justice
douglas
indicated
in
the
unexcelled
chemical
corporation
case.
when
the
breach
of
duty
occurs,
not
when
that
breach
is
--
is
discovered.
here,
and
this
is
a
--
a
sort
of
a
typical
case.
we
have
performance
in
1956.
the
breach
occurred.
we
think
the
alleged
breach
when
the
laboratory
test
were
made
which
was
october
and
november
1956
and
certainly
no
later
than
after
that
was
arranged
by
a
change
order
can
affect
compromise,
certainly
no
later
than
the
goods
were
delivered
and
the
work
was
performed
so
that
the
payment
was
due.
the
opposing
position
is
that
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
accrue
until
after
the
final
administrative
determination.
that's
the
position
that
the
court
of
claims
has
recently
taken
in
the
nager
electric
case.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
in
our
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
in
our
view,
the
result
would
be
the
same
as
if
--
as
if
it
was
here.
in
this
case
of
course,
the
only
trouble
was
cause
because
the
claim
was
filed
so
late
administratively
but
in
theory,
as
far
as
the
operation
of
the
statute,
we
think
that
it
--
it
runs
from
the
time
there's
a
breach
of
the
duty.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
that's
the
--
the
factual
situation
we
have
here
as
we
conceded.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
filing
here
was
late.
it
was
almost
five
years
after
the
--
the
claim
accrue
but
there
wasn't
any
administrative
decision
here
until
after
the
six
years
had
run
on
our
--
on
our
theory
and
our
view
is
that
that
--
let
me
point
this
out.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
we
say
your
honor,
if
they
filed
it
and
the
administrative
agency
has
not
decided,
they're
free
to
file
a
protective
claim
--
a
protective
suit
and
that's
what
the
court
of
the
second
circuit
held
as
early
as
1960
and
indeed
the
southern
district
in
new
york
held
as
early
as
1955.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
and
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
the
government
does
on
the
other
side
in
the
walsh-healey
act
situation
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
on
unexcelled
chemical
and
unexcelled
chemical
is
a
two-year
statute
limitations.
the
proceeding
in
the
court
is
on
the
administrative
record.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
that
the
cause
of
action
accrue
at
the
time
of
the
breach
of
duty
and
that
is
not
tolled
--
there
is
no
tolling
involved
in
this
court's
decision
and
the
result
is
that
in
those
instances,
when
the
administrative
decision
is
not
made
within
the
two-year
period
in
that
statute,
a
protective
suit
is
filed.
let
me
point
out
that
this
is
a
very,
very
rare
animal
that
we
have
here,
this
--
this
situation.
we
have
looked
for
a
tucker
act
suit
in
which
the
statute
of
limitations
was
urged,
which
the
administrative
determination
was
not
made
within
the
six
years
and
we
have
found
none
at
the
appellate
level
until
this
very
case
that
is
in
all
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
government
contracts
that
we
have.
this
case
is
the
very
first
one
involving
the
six-year
tucker
act
statute
of
limitations
in
which
the
administrative
proceedings
have
not
been
terminated
within
the
six-year
period
and
the
reason
for
that,
i
think
is
clear.
we've
indicated
in
our
briefs
in
the
utah
case
and
the
grace
case
last
year
and
we've
repeated
again
this
year,
the
average
time
before
decisions
is
roughly
11
months
and
the
result
is
that
contractors
--
certainly
those
who
wish
to
do
so
are
--
are
almost
without
exception,
able
to
get
the
claim
heard
and
decided
very,
very
promptly
after
it's
been
filed.
so
this
is
a
very
unusual
situation
and
we
think,
the
facts
of
this
case
explain
why
it's
come
up
this
way,
the
facts
of
this
case
indicated
the
claim
wasn't
filed
administratively
until
almost
five
years
so
that
most
of
the
six-year
period
was
used
up
before
the
claim
was
filed.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no
sir.
the
case
decided
in
the
second
circuit's
decision
show
that
we've
been
urging
it
right
along.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
he
was
right
in
regard
with
the
particular
case,
your
honor.
in
nager
electric,
there
was
a
change
of
view
but
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
in
the
government's
position,
in
the
court
of
claims,
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
david
l.
rose
the
statute
of
limitations
was
urged
only
on
the
breach
claims
initially
as
i
understand
it,
and
it
was
later
that
it
was
urged
on
the
whole
--
to
bar
the
whole
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
i
think
that
--
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i'll
quote
you
from
a
court
of
claims
decision
in
1942
which
i
think
is
fairly
--
or
1937
that's
fairly
typical
court
of
claims
holdings
at
that
period
of
time
and
this
is
a
case
that
was
quoted
and
cited
by
the
second
circuit
in
its
decision,
pink
liquidated
versus
united
states.
this
is
what
the
court
of
claims
has
said.
the
time
is
not
suspended
during
the
period
of
his
claims
reimbursement
under
the
contractor
being
considered
and
passed
upon
by
the
government
officials.
it's
been
repeatedly
held
by
this
court
that
under
contract
to
perform
work,
the
completion
and
acceptance,
they
start
the
statute
to
run.
now
there
was
--
that
particular
case
do
not
have
a
disputes
clause
in
it,
a
case
that
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
but
the
case
that
it's
cited
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
your
honor,
he
said
that
the
court
had
said
repeatedly,
it's
stated
repeatedly.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
of
those
cases
that
he
cites,
only
two
of
them
involve
disputes
claims,
disputes
clause
actions.
and
i
believe
both
of
them,
certainly
at
least
one
of
them
involve
the
holding
of
the
statute
--
that
the
statute
of
limitations
run,
they
both
were
dictum,
there's
never
been
a
holding
in
the
court
of
claims
prior
the
nager
electric
--
along
the
lines
of
nager
electric.
mr.
david
l.
rose
as
to
when
it
--
when
it
accrues.
mr.
david
l.
rose
on
either
your
honor,
there's
no
holdings
and
judge
davis
doesn't
suggest
to
run
any
holdings
prior
to
that.
he
says
that
the
--
there's
language
prior
to
that.
we
point
out
to
our
brief
--
in
our
brief
that
there
is
language
both
ways
in
the
court
of
claims
decisions.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
i
think
there's
a
breach
and
if
your
honor
recalls
the
statute
that
we
have
here
says
when
the
--
when
the
cause
of
action
first
accrues,
we
think
there's
certainly
been
a
breach
of
duty
in
this
case
when
the
original
underlying
violation
occurred
and
that
the
cause
of
action
first
accrued
then.
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh
no,
no,
no.
that's
not
the
problem
we
have
here.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
--
i
think
perhaps
in
the
change,
there
may
be
situations
where
your
honor
is
correct.
i
think
that
the
usual
situation,
the
one
that
we
have
here
is
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
some
duty
on
--
on
the
part
of
--
of
the
government
and
the
performance
to
the
contract
and
certainly
has
to
look
at
the
--
at
the
analytical
--
we
have
to
analyze
the
situation
in
the
case,
but
here,
the
alleged
breach
of
duty
is
the
so-called
improper
testing
and
that
occurred
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
i
think
the
--
the
duty
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
i
think
your
honor,
the
--
the
rule
that's
been
adapted
by
the
court
of
claims
and
(inaudible)
--
it
covers
this
situation
because
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
talking
about
the
--
about
the
earlier
rule,
the
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
the
rule
it
says
delivery
because
if
you've
completed
work
on
the
contract
and
you've
made
delivery,
you've
done
everything
that
you
need
to
in
order
to
get
paid
and
if
you
haven't
been
paid
then
--
then
the
breach
of
duty
has
already
occurred.
mr.
david
l.
rose
so
i
think
the
breach
of
duty
occurs
at
the
times
the
work
has
been
performed.
there
may
be
some
rare
situations
that
are
--
that
--
where
this
is
not
so
but
the
--
certainly
the
usual
case
and
certainly
this
case
is
one
of
which
the
alleged
breach
of
duty
takes
place
during
the
period
of
contractual
performance.
now
if
your
honors
will
recall
the
--
the
nature
of
this
lawsuit
is
a
suit
on
the
contract,
it's
not
a
suit
for
review
of
the
administrative
decision
alone.
it's
not
--
that's
not
the
nature
of
the
suit.
this
is
sued
on
the
contract
under
the
tucker
act.
that's
confirmed
by
the
fact
--
by
the
court's
recent
decision
in
utah
that
these
suits
involved
breach
claims
as
well
as
claims
that
are
covered
by
the
disputes
clause.
so
that
this
is
--
if
this
was
a
suit
for
simply
--
for
review
of
the
administrative
decision,
congress
would
probably
have
provided
a
60
or
90-day
period
of
--
of
statute
of
limitations
but
that's
not
what
it's
done.
it's
provided
the
six-year,
the
conditional
contract,
statute
of
limitations
and
this
six-year
period
example
to
encompass
all
the
administrative
proceedings
and
the
overwhelming
majority
cases.
the
two
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
which
we
think
refute
judge
davis'
position
in
the
court
of
claims
are
mcmahon
and
unexcelled
chemical.
the
mcmahon
case,
there
was
a
statutory
requirement,
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
this
court
nevertheless
held
that
the
cause
of
action
accrued
when
the
breach
occurred.
that
was
the
tort
type
duty
that
was
in
the
seaman's
claim
for
unseaworthiness
and
negligence
and
the
court
held
notwithstanding
the
--
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
statute
required
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
the
cause
of
action
accrued
at
the
time
of
the
breach
of
duty
and
we
think
the
same
as
true
here.
and
unexcelled
chemical
was
the
government's
suit
on
behalf
of
underpaid
employees
under
the
walsh-healey
act
and
there
too,
the
court
held
that
the
cause
of
action
was
created
when
the
breach
of
duty
occurred
and
there
too
your
honor,
the
exhaustion
was
a
prerequisite.
now
judge
davis
says
that
it
wasn't,
but
the
statute
there
requires
the
secretary
of
labor
to
hold
the
hearing
and
forbids
them
from
recovering
on
it
unless
there's
been
an
administrative
hearing,
and
that's
the
stronger
case
for
holding
the
cause
of
action
didn't
accrue
because
there,
the
suit
is
only
on
the
administrative
record.
in
here,
we
have
both
this
--
the
part
of
the
suit
that's
on
the
administrative
record
and
the
part
that
involves
the
breach
claims.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
that's
what
the
court
of
claims
has
held
and
we
think
they're
probably
right
because
of
the
rule
by
not
splitting
causes
of
action.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
as
far
as
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
no.
certainly,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
make
the
result
that
we
have
here
under
nager.
if
we
had
--
if
we
brought
that
result
to
this
factual
situation,
you'd
have
a
lawsuit
12,
14,
16
years
after
the
fact
in
which
you're
trying
the
facts
de
novo.
we
don't
think
that
makes
any
sense
at
all.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
think
that
as
much
--
we
have
these
two
advantages,
your
honor,
if
a
protective
suit
is
filed.
we
would
know
what
the
breach
claim
was
and
so
that
the
government
would
be
able
to
protect
its
records
in
which
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
but
the
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
the
breach
claim
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
the
breach
claim,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
asserted
administratively.
the
so-called
breach
claim
under
the
--
under
the
utah
distinction,
the
delay
damage
is
that
sort
of
thing.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
asserted
so
the
government
may
never
know
what
that
is
until
the
lawsuit
is
filed.
we
have
that
and
we
also
have
the
thought
that
if
a
case
has
been
pending
administratively
for
a
long
time,
the
court
can
exercise
supervision
to
make
--
but
hasn't
been
brought
to
a
head
prior
that
time,
it
can
certainly
exercise
supervision
to
see
that
it
does.
so
we
don't
think
that
answer
would
be
the
same
even
if
they're
a
protective
suit.
i
point
out
that
the
protective
suit
is
the
very
rare
situation.
the
only
other
appellate
decisions
that
we've
had
prior
to
this
time
and
it's
been
on
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
where
there
is
only
a
two-year
statute
and
there
have
been
a
few
instances
when
the
period
of
the
statute
--
when
the
period
of
limitations
was
--
the
administrative
proceedings
were
not
ended
within
that
two-year
statute,
but
this
is
the
very
first
case
which
we
have
been
able
to
find
at
the
appellate
level
in
which
the
six-year
statute
is
--
in
which
the
administrative
decision
was
not
over
within
the
six-year
period.
now
as
far
as
the
tolling
provision
is
concern,
the
northern
metal
situation,
i
point
out
first
that
the
statute
that
we
have
here
provides
for
tolling
in
some
situations.
it
provides
for
tolling,
for
persons
under
a
legal
disability
or
beyond
the
seas
at
the
time
the
claim
accrues.
mr.
david
l.
rose
incompetency
your
honor,
minority
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
that's
what
it
--
that's
the
way
it
was
written
originally
and
that's
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
no
sir.
we
don't
say
it's
just
entitled
to
sue
--
the
--
i
think
the
situation
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
the
situation
is
like
it
was
in
unexcelled
chemical
and
it's
like
it
was
in
the
primary
jurisdiction
cases,
your
honor,
where
the
deference
required
here
to
the
contract
in
the
primary
jurisdiction
cases
to
the
expertise
of
the
agency
requires
the
court
to
hold
its
hands
until
the
administrator
has
decided,
but
suit
is
permitted
prior
that
time
and
certainly,
suit
is
permitted
on
the
breach
claims.
mr.
david
l.
rose
in
the
contract,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
the
disputes
clause
and
it
says
that
the
claim
shall
be
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
believe
it's
at
page
two
or
three
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
starts
at
page
three,
three
and
four.
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh,
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
it's
page
two.
the
statute
is
set
forth
on
in
full
at
page
two.
the
action
of
any
person
under
legal
disability
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
now
i
point
out
that
congress
where
it
has
wished
to
provide
for
tolling
has
done
so
expressly
such
as
in
the
maritime
contracts
for
war
risk
insurance,
claims
for
veteran
insurance,
the
tort
claims
act
and
so
forth.
and
indeed
a
statute
will
just
pass
this
very
year
involves
--
puts
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
government
for
its
affirmative
suits
and
that
provides
for
six-year
period
of
limitations
but
only
for
one
year.
it's
extensive
for
one
year
after
the
final
administrative
decision
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
in
the
case
that
they
were
kind
of
fighting
final
decisions
under
disputes
clause,
so
that
congress
has
had
these
things
in
mind
and
as
well
we're
about
to
take
care
of
it.
the
legislative
history
of
the
wunderlich
act,
i
suggest
that
congress
was
confronted
with
the
problem
almost
identical
to
the
one
we
have
here
and
that
it
wished
to
leave
the
government
entitled
or
with
the
exist
--
preexisting
protections.
if
the
court
will
refer
to
page
27
of
the
brief,
we've
set
out
the
relevant
portion
of
the
house
report.
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh
yes.
the
court
--
the
--
this
is
the
house
report.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
your
honor,
i
--
we're
not
suggesting
there's
no
review.
we're
suggesting
that
what
the
contractor
should
do
that
this
doesn't
arise
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh,
i'd
say
that
if
he
didn't
file
a
suit
within
six
years,
congress
intended
to
bar
it,
that's
what
the
statute
says.
it
says
every
action
shall
be
barred
unless
filed
within
six
years.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor,
i'll
refer
you
to
this
paragraph
i
was
just
quoting
(inaudible)
from
page
27,
this
is
the

mr.
david

you,
