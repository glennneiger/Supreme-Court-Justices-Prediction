mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
a
government
supply
contract.
petitioner,
because
of
a
change,
requested
an
upward
price
adjustment
in
the
contract
price
and
upon
the
contracting
officers'
adverse
decision
took
an
appeal.
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals
decision
was
also
adverse.
thereupon,
petitioner
brought
a
tucker
act
suit
in
the
district
court
below.
we
are
concerned
solely
with
the
statute
of
limitations
which
in
this
case
bars
the
action
unless
filed
within
six
years
after
the
right
of
action
first
accrues.
the
district
court
action
was
filed
more
than
six
years
after
the
final
contract
delivery
date
although
at
the
time
involved
in
the
administrative
proceeding
be
excluded,
the
action
was
filed
within
a
secured
period.
the
aspca
decision
was
filed
six
years
four-and-a-half
months
after
the
final
contract
delivery
date
although
the
contract
claim
was
made
more
than
a
year
prior
to
the
final
contract
delivery
date.
now
there
are
three
issues
involved.
first
is
whether
the
contractor,
while
the
contract
administrative
proceeding
is
pending,
must
bring
a
protective
suit
in
order
to
stay
the
running
of
the
statute.
second,
is
the
statute
extended
to
the
date
of
the
board's
decision
so
that
it
does
not
start
to
run
until
that
time
or
that
date?
and
third,
is
the
statute
tolled
during
the
time
of
the
contractor's
claim
is
pending
in
the
contract
administrative
proceeding.
to
change
this
article
under
which
the
claim
arose
provided
for
resolution
of
any
dispute
by
the
disputes
article
which
in
turn
provided
for
decision
by
the
contracting
officer
with
appeal
to
the
secretary
whose
decision
on
that
of
his
representative
was
final
and
conclusive.
the
disputes
article
proceeding
was
mandatory.
now,
the
implied
contract
which
petitioner
had
was
for
canteen
covers
and
it
provided
that
the
dyed
felt
therefore
should
contain
a
minimum
amount
of
mildew
inhibitor
and
be
tested.
the
respondent,
after
testing
it,
rejected
the
felt,
were
not
containing
the
required
amount
of
inhibitor
without
disclosing
the
test
that
it
made.
now
the
petitioners'
deliveries
were
delayed
some
three
months
odd
and
its
manufacturing
cost
increase
by
these
rejections.
then
the
canteen
covers
were
accepted
upon
the
making
of
a
downward
price
adjustment
similarly
under
the
changes
article.
now
much
later
but
well
within
the
six-year
period
after
final
delivery,
the
petitioner
discovered
that
the
respondent
had
rejected
the
dyed
felt
by
the
use
of
a
colorimetric
test
which
was
not
provided
by
the
contract
and
which
we
contend
was
not
accurate
as
the
dyed
felt.
now
the
petitioner
requested
the
contracting
officer
to
make
an
equitable
upward
price
adjustment
and
from
his
denial
took
an
appeal
and
upon
the
adverse
decision
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals
brought
this
tucker
act
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
now
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
it
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
ruling
that
the
statutes
started
to
run
on
the
date
of
the
final
contract
deliveries.
petitioner
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
that
court
on
the
division
affirmed
the
judgment.
now,
the
three
issues
involved
as
i
said
are
staying,
extending
or
tolling
the
statute
of
limitations.
now,
this
urge
to
their
protective
suit
must
be
instituted
to
stay
the
running
of
the
statute
while
the
administrative
remedy
is
being
pursued.
if
the
protective
suit
be
the
rule
and
many
lawyers
would
advise
their
clients
to
file
actions
in
the
district
courts
or
in
the
court
of
claims
at
the
time
that
the
administrative
proceeding
under
the
disputes
article
has
instituted.
now
the
defendant
--
now
the
respondent
in
his
brief
has
referred
to
an
article
by
mr.
spector,
the
chairman
on
board
of
appeals.
that's
on
page
34,
the
respondent's
brief.
now
on
page
284,
mr.
spector's
article
has
noted
there
are
11,856
appeals
redacted
by
the
aspca
and
the
predecessors
and
that
only
467
were
filed
in
court.
now
had
the
rule
of
protective
suit
been
required
then
instead
of
467
suits,
it
might
have
been
11,856
suits.
now
we
submit
that
the
dockets
of
the
courts
are
too
crowded
for
congress
to
have
intended
that
suit
must
be
brought
by
the
contracting
officer
and
the
board
of
appeals
are
engaged
in
ascertaining
the
facts
which
will
determine
whether
the
government
will
pay
the
claim.
now
many
worthy
claims
wouldn't
be
defeated
in
the
cases
of
claimants
unaware
of
the
need
for
bringing
such
effective
actions
and
many
courts
wouldn't
dismiss
a
protective
suit
as
premature
and
probably
any
assistant
united
states'
attorney
would
so
urge.
so
we
submit
that
a
protective
suit
is
not
required.
the
next
we
submit
that
a
--
the
statute
is
extended
by
the
contract
disputes
article
and
proceeding
does
not
begin
to
run
until
the
final
administrative
decision.
i
might
say
that
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
rendered
in
this
case
which
was
in
june
of
1966
and
the
court
of
claims
rendered
a
nager
electric
decision
in
october
1966
which
is
reported
at
368
f.2d
847
and
that's
mr.
judge
--
judge
davis'
opinion
and
which
supports
this
point
of
our
argument.
a
contractor's
claim
for
equitable
price
adjustment
comes
within
the
disputes
article
since
it
is
compensable
under
the
changes
article
and
the
contractor
may
not
bring
a
tucker
act
suit
until
he
has
exhausted
the
administrative
remedies
provided
by
the
contract
and
should
he
sue
without
exhausting
such
remedies
is
suitably
dismissed.
now
under
the
wunderlich
act
of
9/11/1954,
no
suit
can
be
instituted
unless
the
contractor
can
say
that
the
final
administrative
decision
is
subject
to
judicial
reversal
because
it's
arbitrary,
it's
capricious,
fraudulent,
in
bad
faith,
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
or
erroneous
in
law.
now
it
cannot
in
this
suit
of
any
of
those
things
until
the
administrative
decision
is
rendered.
he
must
secure
the
decision
before
he
can
attack
it.
and
the
district
courts
and
the
court
of
claims
are
limited
to
a
review
of
the
administrative
record
and
may
not
take
evidence
de
novo.
now
in
any
matter,
required
to
be
submitted
to
the
board
of
appeals,
a
contractor
has
bound
himself
to
the
administrative
course
and
he
has
agreed
to
convert
a
breach
of
contract
claim
to
one
of
relief
under
the
contract.
the
claims
under
the
changes,
changed
conditions
or
delays-damages
articles,
the
contractor
must
file
a
claim
with
the
contracting
officer
and
that
the
decision
being
adverse,
he
must
appeal
to
the
board
of
appeals
then
he
can't
ask
the
united
states
to
pay
any
amounts
on
account
of
his
claim
until
the
board
of
appeals
files
a
decision.
he
can't
sue
in
court
until
he
has
a
right
to
demand
payment.we
submit
that
that
is
when
the
right
of
action
first
accrued.
now
limitation
statutes
aren't
designed
to
promote
justice
by
preventing
surprise
and
revival
of
claims
but
have
been
allowed
to
slumber
until
evidence
has
been
lost
or
memories
have
faded
and
witnesses
have
disappeared.
now
in
contract
administrative
proceedings,
cases
claims
are
promptly
made,
evidence
is
presented,
memories
are
threshed
and
witnesses
appear
and
testify.
the
reason
for
the
statute
of
limitations
we
submit
is
not
present
in
these
cases.now
in
the
united
states
steel
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
which
is
cited
by
the
respondent
on
page
21
of
its
brief,
judge
davis
writing
for
the
court
of
claims
said
that
the
delay,
the
1946
to
1958
in
the
board
proceeding
there,
that
there
is
no
claim
or
reason
to
believe
that
the
government
evidence
or
records
which
would
have
been
introduced
before
the
board
were
lost,
destroyed,
unavailable
or
grew
stale.
judge
davis
said
that
the
record
did
not
show
the
reasons
for
the
delay
or
who
was
at
fault,
that
the
parties
attempted
to
cast
the
blame
on
each
other
but
that
the
court
could
not
tell
which
side
was
right
and
that
in
any
event,
the
court
felt
that
the
government
was
in
no
position
to
complain
of
delay
since
it
had
allowed
the
proceedings
to
remain
dormant
for
over
10
years.
now
there's
no
inherent
delay
in
contract
administrative
proceedings.
as
it
was
noted
in
the
court's
utah
construction
company
decision,
there
are
built-in
limitations
on
claims
under
the
contract.changes

the

clause,
10

and
there's
only
the
contracting
officer
who
can
raise
those
time
limitations.
the
contractor
cannot.
now
with
respect
to
manners
which
are
properly
pursued
with
the
disputes
proceeding
which
has
lasted
beyond
contract
completion
--
mr.

mr.

j.
mcdermott
well
that's

that's
10

mr.

after

after

contacting

has
the
discretion
under
the
changes
article.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
he
--
he
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
there
wasn't
--
well,
there
wasn't
a
--
the
contractor
claimed
to
the
contracting
officers
that
he
had
not
been
informed
at
the
time
that
the
dyed
felt
has
been
rejected,
that
it
had
used
a
colorimetric
test.
now
apparently,
the
contracting
officer
accepted
that
allegation.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
there's
immediate
notification.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
immediate
notification.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
we
didn't
have
to
act
any
sooner
than
we
did
because
we
alleged
and
the
contracting
officer
accepted
our
statement
that
we
had
only
recently
discovered
that
the
colorimetric
test
had
been
used.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that
a
colorimetric
test,
that's
a
form
of
test,
this
was
a
--
a
product
called
ddm,
dichloro-diethoxy
methane
which
is
a
mildew
inhibitor
and
there
were
various
tests
spelled
out
for
determining
the
quantitative
amount
of
it.
and
the
colorimetric
test
which
was
used
was
not
spelled
out
in
the
contract
specifications
and
it
was
the
petitioner's
information
that
it
wouldn't
work
as
to
a
dyed
material.
and
apparently,
the
contracting
officer
accepted
the
contractor's
allegation
and
acted
upon
what
you
might
say
as
his
late
request.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
no,
no,
no.
it's
--
it's
his
discretion
only.
the
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
there
is
a
10-day
clause,
10-day
provision
in
the
changes
clause.
the
changes
clause
is
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well,
it's
--
what
has
grown
up
to
be
known
as
a
constructive
change
and
that
is
if
the
--
if
there
is
a
change
in
specifications
without
a
written
order
from
the
contracting
officer
but
that
is
the
conduct
of
the
government
that
has
been
considered
to
amount
to
a
constructive
change.
i
believe
that
it
said,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
utah
construction
company
case
was
a
constructive
change.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well,
the
--
i
would
say
in
the
matter
it
was
four-and-a-half
years.
the
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
he
took
(inaudible)
it
says
this.
that
the
contract
is
--
i'm
reading
from
the
changes
clause
which
is
on
page
eight
of
the
record.
it's
in
--
in
the
district
court's
opinion
that
provided
however
that
the
contracting
officer,
if
he
decides
that
the
facts
justify
such
action
may
receive
and
act
upon
any
sets
claim
asserted
at
any
time
prior
to
final
payment
under
this
contract
and
he's
the
only
one
who
can
receive
a
late
claim
if
the
contractor
files
a
late
claim
and
the
contracting
officer
rejects
it,
contract
claim
is
defeated.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
no,
no.
i
--
i
think
it
was
a
proper
claim
even
though
it
was
filed
after
10
--
the
10-day
period
because
it
was
alleged
that
the
contractor
only
reasonably
discovered
the
test
which
had
been
made
and
the
contracting
officer
accepted
that.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
in
fact,
the
--
if
the
contracting
officer
wants
to
do
it,
he
can
do
it.
but
he
--
the
result
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
no,
there's
always
a
limitation
of
final
claimant.
see,
if
there
is
final
claimant
then
the
contracting
officer
can't
act.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that
then
arose.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
the
--
the
first
disclosure
was
made
in
october
1959
and
there
was
a
further
disclosure
made
in
about
probably
like
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
yes,
yes.
and
there
was
a
further
disclosure
made
about
a
year
--
about
a
year
after
then,
about
1960
or
through
1961
and
then
the
contractor
made
this
claim.
now
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
oh,
i
would
say
within
maybe
30,
60,
90
days.
but
the
--
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
colorimetric
test
--
like
--
the
issue
is
to
whether
the
contractor
had
been
informed
of
the
fact
of
the
colorimetric
test.
it
was
never
controverted
by
the
contracting
officer
and
if
he
chose
to
accept
the
claim
even
though
he
denied
it,
that
was
his
discretion
under
the
changes
article
because
he
had
the
right
to
do
it
so
long
as
final
payment
had
not
been
made.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
the
final
deliveries
under
the
contract
were
december
the
14th,
1956
but
the
board
of
appeals'
decision
wasn't
until
february
28,
1963.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
right
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
now
the
--
now
we
say
that
the
court
of
claims
has
said
again
and
again
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
arise
and
the
statute
of
limitation
doesn't
run
until
this
final
administrative
determination.
now
the
government
has
known
for
decades
that
the
contract
suits
will
be
timely.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
these
series
of
suits
where
opinions
have
been
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
since
this
crown
coat
decision
came
out
in
june
in
1966,
the
government
went
before
the
court
and
didn't
argue
this
issue
that
the
statute
doesn't
start
to
run
on
the
board
of
appeals
decision
and
it
wasn't
until
after
oral
argument
in
the
nager
electric
case
and
united
states
steel
before
them.
they're
coming
out
every
month
that
the
court
of
claims
issues
decisions.
it
wasn't
until
after
oral
argument
that
the
government
changed
its
position
and
argued
that
the
statute
started
to
run
on
final
contract
delivery
so
that
theretofore
apparently
accepted
the
court
of
claims'
rule
that
the
statute
didn't
start
to
run
until
after
the
final
administrative
decision
under
the
disputes
article.
now,
the
--
we
--
so
we
submit
that
that
is
the
date
when
the
statute
starts
to
run.
now
we
come
to
the
issue
of
tolling,
that
is
tolling
during
the
period
of
contract
administrative
proceedings
and
that
was
the
issue
i
believe
in
which
the
court
granted
certiorari.
the
court
below
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
provided.
judge
waterman
wrote
an
opinion
sustaining
the
rule
that
the
statute
run
from
the
final
contract
delivery
date
and
judge
anderson
wrote
a
dissent
stating
that
it
was
tolled
during
the
contract
administrative
proceeding.
and
judge
freedman
in
northern
metal
decision
of
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
decided
that
the
statute
was
tolled.
now,
of
course
it's
--
it's
our
opinion
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
court
of
claims'
rule
is
the
proper
one
that
if
you
have
to
file
your
claim
of
contracting
officer
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
we're
all
right
--
we're
--
we're
still
in
tolling,
yes.
in
tolling,
our
suit
was
started
five
years
and
eight
months
a
--
after
--
within
the
six
--
that
is
within
the
six-year
period.
and
that's
acknowledged
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
below.
now
with
respect
to
tolling,
we
submit
judge
anderson's
opinion,
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
below
probably
we
submit
should
be
accepted
by
the
court
as
the
best
statement
of
that
doctrine
and
i
don't
believe
we
can
add
anything
to
it.
now,
there
is
also
a
tolling
issue
which
comes
up
before
the
court
on
the
next
case
hans
against
the
attorney
general
and
that
is
tolling
on
the
basis
of
equitable
estoppel
and
as
it
applies
here,
it
comes
from
the
court's
decision
in
glus,
g-l-u-s
versus
brooklyn
eastern
terminal
which
is
cited
on
our
brief.
now
of
course
if
the
court
should
decide
that
tolling
arises
because
the
government
by
its
conduct
is
equitably
estopped
from
pleading
the
statute
of
limitation
then
that's
an
additional
ground
for
reversing
the
court
below
in
our
case,
but
we
deferred
the
counsel
in
the
--
on
the
case
to
present
the
equitable
estoppel.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
court
of
claims
too.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
--
that's
our
point.
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
nager
electric
company
case
against
the
united
states,
i
believe
the
answer
to
the
question
you
directed
to
my
brother
is
contained.
in
that
case,
judge
davis
expressed
the
opinion
for
the
court
of
claims
that
if
there
are
two
types
of
claims,
which
arise
under
a
contract,
one
which
is
a
breach
and
one
which
is
a
disputes
article
proceeding
that
is
the
claim
under
the
changed
conditions
or
delays-damages
articles,
then
the
contractor
has
a
choice
to
make.
he
may,
if
he
wished
immediately
sue
on
his
breach,
within
the
six-year
period
if
he
doesn't
want
to
wait
for
the
administrative
proceedings
to
be
concluded,
but
if
he
does
so,
then
he
takes
the
chance
that
if
that
be
concluded
before
the
disputes
article
proceeding
is
completed,
then
he
wouldn't
be
able
under
the
single-suit
theory
to
amend
to
bring
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
but
also
that
since
both
suits
arise
out
of
the
same
contract
and
there
should
be
only
one
suit,
he
will
be
permitted
if
he
chooses
to
do
so
to
await
until
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
proceedings
and
then
bring
both
his
breach
suit
and
his
administrative
proceeding
breached
claim
and
his
administrative
proceeding
claim
in
the
same
suit.
now,
i
understood
that
mr.
–
my
brother
stated
that
the
solicitor
general
agreed
with
that
view
that
there
should
be
only
one
action.
now,
also
with
respect
to
what
position
of
the
department
of
justice
was
before
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
i
do
agree
with
the
single
contract,
single-suit
theory
that
was
my
point.
now,
with
respect
to
the
position
which
the
department,
that
is
the
solicitor
general
in
the
united
states
court
of
claims
as
the
defendant
represented
by
the
department
of
justice,
nager
electric
company
case
of
course,
when
our
brief
was
submitted
it
was
only
in
slip
opinion,
but
since
then
it
has
been
reported
in
f.2d
(federal
second)
and
it's
at
368
f.2d
(federal
second)
847
and
368
i
beg
your
pardon,
and
referring
to
page
854
and
note
18,
judge
davis
said
this.
indicative
of
the
government's
general
acceptance
in
this
court,
prior
to
its
recent
re-survey
of
its
position
of
the
rule
that
the
claim
does
not
accrue
until
the
administrative
determination
are
the
several
instances
in
recent
years
in
which
the
government
has
suggested
dismissal
of
the
petition
in
this
court,
because
the
contractor
had
not
yet
obtained
a
final
administrative
decision
on
his
claim.
it
is
also
significant
that
the
government's
briefs
initially
filed
in
the
four
contract
cases
now
before
us,
as
well
as
in
some
others
assume
implicitly
or
explicitly
that
limitation
does
not
run
on
claims
under
the
contract
until
the
administrative
determination.
for
this
court,
the
change
in
the
government's
view
did
not
come
until
after
oral
argument
in
the
present
case.
now,
i,
always
understood
the
rule
in
the
court
of
claims
was
that
you
were
required
under
this
court's
decisions
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedy
provided
by
the
clauses
of
the
contract,
changes,
changed
conditions,
delays-damages
articles
and
pursue
the
remedy
provided
by
the
disputes
article,
and
that
not
until
you
receive
the
final
administrative
decision
were
you
are
permitted
to
proceed
judicially
in
the
court
of
claims.
now,
judge
davis
in
his
opinion,
states
that
that
is
the
logical
position
to
take
and
i
don't
see
where
there's
any
quarrel
that
can
be
had
with
it
when
you
view
it
from
that
viewpoint.
now,
anytime
that
there
is
an
administrative
proceeding
of
course,
all
the
government's
evidence
is
presented,
their
obligation
to
themselves,
their
witnesses
testified,
the
claimants
witnesses
testify,
exhibits
are
introduced,
a
record
is
made
and
nothing
is
lost
to
the
government
by
waiting
until
the
administrative
proceeding
is
completed
before
a
suit
is
instituted
and
when
a
suit
is
instituted,
then
the
reviewing
court
has
only
the
right
to
examine
the
record
made
before
the
administrative
tribunal.
so,
we
submit
that
all
elements
of
fairness
and
justice
require
that
the
court
of
claims
rule
that
the
statute
does
not
start
to
run
until
the
final
administrative
decision
be
adopted
by
the
court,
thanks.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
a
government
supply
contract.
petitioner,
because
of
a
change,
requested
an
upward
price
adjustment
in
the
contract
price
and
upon
the
contracting
officers'
adverse
decision
took
an
appeal.
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals
decision
was
also
adverse.
thereupon,
petitioner
brought
a
tucker
act
suit
in
the
district
court
below.
we
are
concerned
solely
with
the
statute
of
limitations
which
in
this
case
bars
the
action
unless
filed
within
six
years
after
the
right
of
action
first
accrues.
the
district
court
action
was
filed
more
than
six
years
after
the
final
contract
delivery
date
although
at
the
time
involved
in
the
administrative
proceeding
be
excluded,
the
action
was
filed
within
a
secured
period.
the
aspca
decision
was
filed
six
years
four-and-a-half
months
after
the
final
contract
delivery
date
although
the
contract
claim
was
made
more
than
a
year
prior
to
the
final
contract
delivery
date.
now
there
are
three
issues
involved.
first
is
whether
the
contractor,
while
the
contract
administrative
proceeding
is
pending,
must
bring
a
protective
suit
in
order
to
stay
the
running
of
the
statute.
second,
is
the
statute
extended
to
the
date
of
the
board's
decision
so
that
it
does
not
start
to
run
until
that
time
or
that
date?
and
third,
is
the
statute
tolled
during
the
time
of
the
contractor's
claim
is
pending
in
the
contract
administrative
proceeding.
to
change
this
article
under
which
the
claim
arose
provided
for
resolution
of
any
dispute
by
the
disputes
article
which
in
turn
provided
for
decision
by
the
contracting
officer
with
appeal
to
the
secretary
whose
decision
on
that
of
his
representative
was
final
and
conclusive.
the
disputes
article
proceeding
was
mandatory.
now,
the
implied
contract
which
petitioner
had
was
for
canteen
covers
and
it
provided
that
the
dyed
felt
therefore
should
contain
a
minimum
amount
of
mildew
inhibitor
and
be
tested.
the
respondent,
after
testing
it,
rejected
the
felt,
were
not
containing
the
required
amount
of
inhibitor
without
disclosing
the
test
that
it
made.
now
the
petitioners'
deliveries
were
delayed
some
three
months
odd
and
its
manufacturing
cost
increase
by
these
rejections.
then
the
canteen
covers
were
accepted
upon
the
making
of
a
downward
price
adjustment
similarly
under
the
changes
article.
now
much
later
but
well
within
the
six-year
period
after
final
delivery,
the
petitioner
discovered
that
the
respondent
had
rejected
the
dyed
felt
by
the
use
of
a
colorimetric
test
which
was
not
provided
by
the
contract
and
which
we
contend
was
not
accurate
as
the
dyed
felt.
now
the
petitioner
requested
the
contracting
officer
to
make
an
equitable
upward
price
adjustment
and
from
his
denial
took
an
appeal
and
upon
the
adverse
decision
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals
brought
this
tucker
act
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
now
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
it
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
ruling
that
the
statutes
started
to
run
on
the
date
of
the
final
contract
deliveries.
petitioner
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
that
court
on
the
division
affirmed
the
judgment.
now,
the
three
issues
involved
as
i
said
are
staying,
extending
or
tolling
the
statute
of
limitations.
now,
this
urge
to
their
protective
suit
must
be
instituted
to
stay
the
running
of
the
statute
while
the
administrative
remedy
is
being
pursued.
if
the
protective
suit
be
the
rule
and
many
lawyers
would
advise
their
clients
to
file
actions
in
the
district
courts
or
in
the
court
of
claims
at
the
time
that
the
administrative
proceeding
under
the
disputes
article
has
instituted.
now
the
defendant
--
now
the
respondent
in
his
brief
has
referred
to
an
article
by
mr.
spector,
the
chairman
on
board
of
appeals.
that's
on
page
34,
the
respondent's
brief.
now
on
page
284,
mr.
spector's
article
has
noted
there
are
11,856
appeals
redacted
by
the
aspca
and
the
predecessors
and
that
only
467
were
filed
in
court.
now
had
the
rule
of
protective
suit
been
required
then
instead
of
467
suits,
it
might
have
been
11,856
suits.
now
we
submit
that
the
dockets
of
the
courts
are
too
crowded
for
congress
to
have
intended
that
suit
must
be
brought
by
the
contracting
officer
and
the
board
of
appeals
are
engaged
in
ascertaining
the
facts
which
will
determine
whether
the
government
will
pay
the
claim.
now
many
worthy
claims
wouldn't
be
defeated
in
the
cases
of
claimants
unaware
of
the
need
for
bringing
such
effective
actions
and
many
courts
wouldn't
dismiss
a
protective
suit
as
premature
and
probably
any
assistant
united
states'
attorney
would
so
urge.
so
we
submit
that
a
protective
suit
is
not
required.
the
next
we
submit
that
a
--
the
statute
is
extended
by
the
contract
disputes
article
and
proceeding
does
not
begin
to
run
until
the
final
administrative
decision.
i
might
say
that
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
rendered
in
this
case
which
was
in
june
of
1966
and
the
court
of
claims
rendered
a
nager
electric
decision
in
october
1966
which
is
reported
at
368
f.2d
847
and
that's
mr.
judge
--
judge
davis'
opinion
and
which
supports
this
point
of
our
argument.
a
contractor's
claim
for
equitable
price
adjustment
comes
within
the
disputes
article
since
it
is
compensable
under
the
changes
article
and
the
contractor
may
not
bring
a
tucker
act
suit
until
he
has
exhausted
the
administrative
remedies
provided
by
the
contract
and
should
he
sue
without
exhausting
such
remedies
is
suitably
dismissed.
now
under
the
wunderlich
act
of
9/11/1954,
no
suit
can
be
instituted
unless
the
contractor
can
say
that
the
final
administrative
decision
is
subject
to
judicial
reversal
because
it's
arbitrary,
it's
capricious,
fraudulent,
in
bad
faith,
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
or
erroneous
in
law.
now
it
cannot
in
this
suit
of
any
of
those
things
until
the
administrative
decision
is
rendered.
he
must
secure
the
decision
before
he
can
attack
it.
and
the
district
courts
and
the
court
of
claims
are
limited
to
a
review
of
the
administrative
record
and
may
not
take
evidence
de
novo.
now
in
any
matter,
required
to
be
submitted
to
the
board
of
appeals,
a
contractor
has
bound
himself
to
the
administrative
course
and
he
has
agreed
to
convert
a
breach
of
contract
claim
to
one
of
relief
under
the
contract.
the
claims
under
the
changes,
changed
conditions
or
delays-damages
articles,
the
contractor
must
file
a
claim
with
the
contracting
officer
and
that
the
decision
being
adverse,
he
must
appeal
to
the
board
of
appeals
then
he
can't
ask
the
united
states
to
pay
any
amounts
on
account
of
his
claim
until
the
board
of
appeals
files
a
decision.
he
can't
sue
in
court
until
he
has
a
right
to
demand
payment.we
submit
that
that
is
when
the
right
of
action
first
accrued.
now
limitation
statutes
aren't
designed
to
promote
justice
by
preventing
surprise
and
revival
of
claims
but
have
been
allowed
to
slumber
until
evidence
has
been
lost
or
memories
have
faded
and
witnesses
have
disappeared.
now
in
contract
administrative
proceedings,
cases
claims
are
promptly
made,
evidence
is
presented,
memories
are
threshed
and
witnesses
appear
and
testify.
the
reason
for
the
statute
of
limitations
we
submit
is
not
present
in
these
cases.now
in
the
united
states
steel
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
which
is
cited
by
the
respondent
on
page
21
of
its
brief,
judge
davis
writing
for
the
court
of
claims
said
that
the
delay,
the
1946
to
1958
in
the
board
proceeding
there,
that
there
is
no
claim
or
reason
to
believe
that
the
government
evidence
or
records
which
would
have
been
introduced
before
the
board
were
lost,
destroyed,
unavailable
or
grew
stale.
judge
davis
said
that
the
record
did
not
show
the
reasons
for
the
delay
or
who
was
at
fault,
that
the
parties
attempted
to
cast
the
blame
on
each
other
but
that
the
court
could
not
tell
which
side
was
right
and
that
in
any
event,
the
court
felt
that
the
government
was
in
no
position
to
complain
of
delay
since
it
had
allowed
the
proceedings
to
remain
dormant
for
over
10
years.
now
there's
no
inherent
delay
in
contract
administrative
proceedings.
as
it
was
noted
in
the
court's
utah
construction
company
decision,
there
are
built-in
limitations

and
there's

the

cannot.
now
with
respect
to
manners
which
are
properly
pursued
with
the

which
has
lasted

at
the
time
that

been

that

now
apparently,

edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
we
didn't
have
to
act
any
sooner
than
we
did
because
we
alleged
and
the
contracting
officer
accepted
our
statement
that
we
had
only
recently
discovered
that
the
colorimetric
test
had
been
used.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that
a
colorimetric
test,
that's
a
form
of
test,
this
was
a
--
a
product
called
ddm,
dichloro-diethoxy
methane
which
is
a
mildew
inhibitor
and
there
were
various
tests
spelled
out
for
determining
the
quantitative
amount
of
it.
and
the
colorimetric
test
which
was
used
was
not
spelled
out
in
the
contract
specifications
and
it
was
the
petitioner's
information
that
it
wouldn't
work
as
to
a
dyed
material.
and
apparently,
the
contracting
officer
accepted
the
contractor's
allegation
and
acted
upon
what
you
might
say
as
his
late
request.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
no,
no,
no.
it's
--
it's
his
discretion
only.
the
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
there
is
a
10-day
clause,
10-day
provision
in
the
changes
clause.
the
changes
clause
is
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well,
it's
--
what
has
grown
up
to
be
known
as
a
constructive
change
and
that
is
if
the
--
if
there
is
a
change
in
specifications
without
a
written
order
from
the
contracting
officer
but
that
is
the
conduct
of
the
government
that
has
been
considered
to
amount
to
a
constructive
change.
i
believe
that
it
said,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
utah
construction
company
case
was
a
constructive
change.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well,
the
--
i
would
say
in
the
matter
it
was
four-and-a-half
years.
the
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
he
took
(inaudible)
it
says
this.
that
the
contract
is
--
i'm
reading
from
the
changes
clause
which
is
on
page
eight
of
the
record.
it's
in
--
in
the
district
court's
opinion
that
provided
however
that
the
contracting
officer,
if
he
decides
that
the
facts
justify
such
action
may
receive
and
act
upon
any
sets
claim
asserted
at
any
time
prior
to
final
payment
under
this
contract
and
he's
the
only
one
who
can
receive
a
late
claim
if
the
contractor
files
a
late
claim
and
the
contracting
officer
rejects
it,
contract
claim
is
defeated.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
no,
no.
i
--
i
think
it
was
a
proper
claim
even
though
it
was
filed
after
10
--
the
10-day
period
because
it
was
alleged
that
the
contractor
only
reasonably
discovered
the
test
which
had
been
made
and
the
contracting
officer
accepted
that.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
in
fact,
the
--
if
the
contracting
officer
wants
to
do
it,
he
can
do
it.
but
he
--
the
result
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
no,
there's
always
a
limitation
of
final
claimant.
see,
if
there
is
final
claimant
then
the
contracting
officer
can't
act.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that
then
arose.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
the
--
the
first
disclosure
was
made
in
october
1959
and
there
was
a
further
disclosure
made
in
about
probably
like
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
yes,
yes.
and
there
was
a
further
disclosure
made
about
a
year
--
about
a
year
after
then,
about
1960
or
through
1961
and
then
the
contractor
made
this
claim.
now
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
oh,
i
would
say
within
maybe
30,
60,
90
days.
but
the
--
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
colorimetric
test
--
like
--
the
issue
is
to
whether
the
contractor
had
been
informed
of
the
fact
of
the
colorimetric
test.
it
was
never
controverted
by
the
contracting
officer
and
if
he
chose
to
accept
the
claim
even
though
he
denied
it,
that
was
his
discretion
under
the
changes
article
because
he
had
the
right
to
do
it
so
long
as
final
payment
had
not
been
made.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
the
final
deliveries
under
the
contract
were
december
the
14th,
1956
but
the
board
of
appeals'
decision
wasn't
until
february
28,
1963.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
right
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
now
the
--
now
we
say
that
the
court
of
claims
has
said
again
and
again
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
arise
and
the
statute
of
limitation
doesn't
run
until
this
final
administrative
determination.
now
the
government
has
known
for
decades
that
the
contract
suits
will
be
timely.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
these
series
of
suits
where
opinions
have
been
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
since
this
crown
coat
decision
came
out
in
june
in
1966,
the
government
went
before
the
court
and
didn't
argue
this
issue
that
the
statute
doesn't
start
to
run
on
the
board
of
appeals
decision
and
it
wasn't
until
after
oral
argument
in
the
nager
electric
case
and
united
states
steel
before
them.
they're
coming
out
every
month
that
the
court
of
claims
issues
decisions.
it
wasn't
until
after
oral
argument
that
the
government
changed
its
position
and
argued
that
the
statute
started
to
run
on
final
contract
delivery
so
that
theretofore
apparently
accepted
the
court
of
claims'
rule
that
the
statute
didn't
start
to
run
until
after
the
final
administrative
decision
under
the
disputes
article.
now,
the
--
we
--
so
we
submit
that
that
is
the
date
when
the
statute
starts
to
run.
now
we
come
to
the
issue
of
tolling,
that
is
tolling
during
the
period
of
contract
administrative
proceedings
and
that
was
the
issue
i
believe
in
which
the
court
granted
certiorari.
the
court
below
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
provided.
judge
waterman
wrote
an
opinion
sustaining
the
rule
that
the
statute
run
from
the
final
contract
delivery
date
and
judge
anderson
wrote
a
dissent
stating
that
it
was
tolled
during
the
contract
administrative
proceeding.
and
judge
freedman
in
northern
metal
decision
of
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
decided
that
the
statute
was
tolled.
now,
of
course
it's
--
it's
our
opinion
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
court
of
claims'
rule
is
the
proper
one
that
if
you
have
to
file
your
claim
of
contracting
officer
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
we're
all
right
--
we're
--
we're
still
in
tolling,
yes.
in
tolling,
our
suit
was
started
five
years
and
eight
months
a
--
after
--
within
the
six
--
that
is
within
the
six-year
period.
and
that's
acknowledged
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
below.
now
with
respect
to
tolling,
we
submit
judge
anderson's
opinion,
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
below
probably
we
submit
should
be
accepted
by
the
court
as
the
best
statement
of
that
doctrine
and
i
don't
believe
we
can
add
anything
to
it.
now,
there
is
also
a
tolling
issue
which
comes
up
before
the
court
on
the
next
case
hans
against
the
attorney
general
and
that
is
tolling
on
the
basis
of
equitable
estoppel
and
as
it
applies
here,
it
comes
from
the
court's
decision
in
glus,
g-l-u-s
versus
brooklyn
eastern
terminal
which
is
cited
on
our
brief.
now
of
course
if
the
court
should
decide
that
tolling
arises
because
the
government
by
its
conduct
is
equitably
estopped
from
pleading
the
statute
of
limitation
then
that's
an
additional
ground
for
reversing
the
court
below
in
our
case,
but
we
deferred
the
counsel
in
the
--
on
the
case
to
present
the
equitable
estoppel.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
court
of
claims
too.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
that's
--
that's
our
point.
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
nager
electric
company
case
against
the
united
states,
i
believe
the
answer
to
the
question
you
directed
to
my
brother
is
contained.
in
that
case,
judge
davis
expressed
the
opinion
for
the
court
of
claims
that
if
there
are
two
types
of
claims,
which
arise
under
a
contract,
one
which
is
a
breach
and
one
which
is
a
disputes
article
proceeding
that
is
the
claim
under
the
changed
conditions
or
delays-damages
articles,
then
the
contractor
has
a
choice
to
make.
he
may,
if
he
wished
immediately
sue
on
his
breach,
within
the
six-year
period
if
he
doesn't
want
to
wait
for
the
administrative
proceedings
to
be
concluded,
but
if
he
does
so,
then
he
takes
the
chance
that
if
that
be
concluded
before
the
disputes
article
proceeding
is
completed,
then
he
wouldn't
be
able
under
the
single-suit
theory
to
amend
to
bring
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
but
also
that
since
both
suits
arise
out
of
the
same
contract
and
there
should
be
only
one
suit,
he
will
be
permitted
if
he
chooses
to
do
so
to
await
until
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
proceedings
and
then
bring
both
his
breach
suit
and
his
administrative
proceeding
breached
claim
and
his
administrative
proceeding
claim
in
the
same
suit.
now,
i
understood
that
mr.
–
my
brother
stated
that
the
solicitor
general
agreed
with
that
view
that
there
should
be
only
one
action.
now,
also
with
respect
to
what
position
of
the
department
of
justice
was
before
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
i
do
agree
with
the
single
contract,
single-suit
theory
that
was
my
point.
now,
with
respect
to
the
position
which
the
department,
that
is
the
solicitor
general
in
the
united
states
court
of
claims
as
the
defendant
represented
by
the
department
of
justice,
nager
electric
company
case
of
course,
when
our
brief
was
submitted
it
was
only
in
slip
opinion,
but
since
then
it
has
been
reported
in
f.2d
(federal
second)
and
it's
at
368
f.2d
(federal
second)
847
and
368
i
beg
your
pardon,
and
referring
to
page
854
and
note
18,
judge
davis
said
this.
indicative
of
the
government's
general
acceptance
in
this
court,
prior
to
its
recent
re-survey
of
its
position
of
the
rule
that
the
claim
does
not
accrue
until
the
administrative
determination
are
the
several
instances
in
recent
years
in
which
the
government
has
suggested
dismissal
of
the
petition
in
this
court,
because
the
contractor
had
not
yet
obtained
a
final
administrative
decision
on
his
claim.
it
is
also
significant
that
the
government's
briefs
initially
filed
in
the
four
contract
cases
now
before
us,
as
well
as
in
some
others
assume
implicitly
or
explicitly
that
limitation
does
not
run
on
claims
under
the
contract
until
the
administrative
determination.
for
this
court,
the
change
in
the
government's
view
did
not
come
until
after
oral
argument
in
the
present
case.
now,
i,
always
understood
the
rule
in
the
court
of
claims
was
that
you
were
required
under
this
court's
decisions
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedy
provided
by
the
clauses
of
the
contract,
changes,
changed
conditions,
delays-damages
articles
and
pursue
the
remedy
provided
by
the
disputes
article,
and
that
not
until
you
receive
the
final
administrative
decision
were
you
are
permitted
to
proceed
judicially
in
the
court
of
claims.
now,
judge
davis
in
his
opinion,
states
that
that
is
the
logical
position
to
take
and
i
don't
see
where
there's
any
quarrel
that
can
be
had
with
it
when
you
view
it
from
that
viewpoint.
now,
anytime
that
there
is
an
administrative
proceeding
of
course,
all
the
government's
evidence
is
presented,
their
obligation
to
themselves,
their
witnesses
testified,
the
claimants
witnesses
testify,
exhibits
are
introduced,
a
record
is
made
and
nothing
is
lost
to
the
government
by
waiting
until
the
administrative
proceeding
is
completed
before
a
suit
is
instituted
and
when
a
suit
is
instituted,
then
the
reviewing
court
has
only
the
right
to
examine
the
record
made
before
the
administrative
tribunal.
so,
we
submit
that
all
elements
of
fairness
and
justice
require
that
the
court
of
claims
rule
that
the
statute
does
not
start
to
run
until
the
final
administrative
decision
be
adopted
by
the
court,
thanks.
