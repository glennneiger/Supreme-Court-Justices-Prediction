mr.
david
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
we
had
discussed
the
question
of
when
the
'cause
of
action'
accrues
in
these
tucker
act
suits
involving
disputes
clauses
and
we've
then
begun
to
discuss
the
question
of
whether
the
period
of
limitation
is
tolled
during
the
pendency
of
the
disputes
clause
proceedings
administratively.
we
had
focused
on
the
statute
itself
and
i
pointed
out
that
the
statute
provides
for
tolling
in
case
of
disability.
mr.
justice
white
inquired
as
to
whether
the
phrase
'disability'
might
be
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
situation
here
and
i'd
like
to
answer
that
now
if
i
may.
i
think
the
answer
is
quite
clearly,
no.
the
original
statute
talked
in
terms
of
married
women,
persons
under
the
age
of
21
and
first
accrued
during
minority
and
of
idiots,
lunatics
and
the
insane
persons,
this
was
what
was
meant
by
disability.
the
statute
was
changed
during
the
revision
of
title
xxviii.
the
revisers
notes
which
are
in
the
united
states
code
make
it
quite
clear
that
it's
only
legal,
these
legal
disabilities
actually
barring
suit
that
constitute
disability
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
so
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
that
phrase
was
not
intended
to
encompass
this
situation
and
none
of
the
courts
have
ever
suggested
that
it
was.
i'd
like
to,
i
think
more
important
perhaps
is
the
question
of
congressional
intent
generally
and
as
the
court
may
recall,
in
1954,
congress
confronted
the
situation
of
disputes
clauses
in
government
contracts.
in
1951
and
there
above
,this
court
in
wunderlich
case
had
held
that
there's
no
review
except
for
fraud.
in
1954,
congress
passed
the
wunderlich
act
and
changed
that
to
provide
for
review
in
accordance
with
the
wunderlich
act
for
substantial
evidence.
it
was
confronted
at
that
time
with
the
statute
of
limitations
problem
and
if
the
court
will
refer
to
page
27
of
the
brief,
the
house
report
there
is
think
quite
illuminating
on
what
congress
understood.
they
were
confronted
with
the
situation,
congress
at
that
time
with
claims
that
had
been
pending
administratively
which
had,
which
the
six
years
had
run
from
1951
through
1954
in
which
there
was
no
suit
permitted
under
this
court's
decision
in
wunderlich
act.
nevertheless,
the
court
said
that
this
statute
would
apply
only
to
claims,
which
were
less
than
six
years
old
and
not
heretofore
filed
in
the
courts.
thus
it's
quite
clear,
that
congress
thought
that
the
significant
thing
in
regard
to
the
statute
of
limitations
was
the
age
of
claim
that
is
when
the
breach
occurred
and
whether
it
was
filed
in
the
courts
and
it
specifically
declined
to
make
the
benefits
of
the
wunderlich
act
available
in
all
of
those
claims
which
had
expired
in
the
three-year
interval.
we
think
this
is
a
much,
that's
an
a
fortiori
situation
from
the
one
we
have
here.
for
here,
the
contractor
had
available
to
him
a
very
easy
remedy,
when
the
claim
was
pending
administratively.
in
his
district,
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
it
was
clear
as
early
as
1955
what
contract
in
this
situation
should
do
and
that
is
to
file
a
suit
and
he
could
have
done
so
and
if
he
had
done
so,
he
would
have
protected
himself
and
at
the
same
time
put
the
government
under
notice
as
to
what
his
claims
actually
were.
so,
we
think
that
congress
was
confronted
with,
if
not
precisely
this
situation,
a
situation
directly
analogous
to
it
and
that
the
solution
that
it
came
to,
it
was
to
protect,
was
to
afford
the
government
the
protection,
which
the
government
receives
under
the
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
these
matters.
it
did
recognize
that
that
statute
was
a
jurisdictional
one
and
has
specifically
declined
to
disturb
the
--
what
is
understood
to
be
the
situation
or
what
we
understand
to
be
situation
that
when
the
claim
accrues
and
is
not
interrupted,
the
period
is
not
interrupted
during
the
pendency
of
administrative
claim.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
now
to
the
reasoning
of
the
third
circuit
in
the
northern
metal's
case.
i'd
point
out
that
again
that
the
third
circuit
is
the
only
court,
which
has
ever
held
that
there's
tolling
during
this
period.
the
court
of
claims
repeatedly
rejected
that
notion.
the
reasoning
of
the
third
circuit
appears
to
be
that
the
government,
if
the
claim
is
pending
administratively,
the
government
is
on
notice
of
the
claim
and
can
protect
its
records
and
so
forth,
but
as
i
think
i
indicated
in
an
answer
to
a
question
for
mr.
justice
fortas
yesterday,
that
reasoning
failed
to
take
into
account
the
breached
claims,
because
there's
no
requirement
in
regard
to
these
so
called
'breached
claims'
of
filing
it
administratively.
so
the
government
does
not
in
fact
know
the
extent
or
the
precise
nature
of
the
claims
when
it's
simply
pending
administratively.
also,
the
reasoning
of
the
third
circuit
would
apply
to
any
matter
that
is
filed
administratively,
whether
it's
filed
administratively
as
a
mandatory
thing
or
permissibly.
yet,
the
court's
have
never
held
that
the
mere
processing
of
an
administrative
claim,
tolled
the
period
of
limitations.
on
the
contrary,
the
court
of
claims
decisions
are
up
until
nager
electric
were
quite
clear
the
other
way
and
so
were
the
district
court
decisions.
so
we
think
that
they
are
notwithstanding
a
plausibility,
the
reasoning
of
third
circuit
is
defective
in
this
particular
regard.
mr.
david
rose
well,
the
court
of
claims
has
held
alternatively
that
the
period
should
be
tolled
for
the
breached
claims
as
well
as
the
other,
because
there's
only
one
cause
of
action
in
each
contract
and
the
court
of
claims
reasons
that
since
you
have
to
file
them
administratively
in
order
to
protect
the
claims,
which
are
within
the
ambit
of
the
disputes
clause,
the
whole
thing
is
tolled.
mr.
david
rose
yes,
claims
under
the
disputes
clause.
mr.
david
rose
well,
that's
right,
but
the
court
of
claims
has
repeatedly
held
and
we
think
it's
probably
good
law
that
there
should
be
only
one
suit
on
each
contract,
particularly
so
in
regard
to
breach
and
arising
under
claims,
because
the
two
overlap
greatly
as
to
the
nature
of
the
facts
and
so
forth.
there
would
be
a
multiplicity
of
suits
to
allow
separate
filings
and
they
have
held
that
there
is
just
one
cause
of
action
on
each
contract.
and
so,
if
it's
tolled,
it
is
tolled
for
all
the
claims
that
come
under
the
contract,
at
least
that's
what
they
felt
and
we
think
that's
probably
right.
mr.
david
rose
that's
what
their
main
holding
your
honor,
but
they
did
hold
alternatively
that
if
they
are
wrong
on
that,
that
they
would
agree
with
the
third
circuit.
mr.
david
rose
i
think
the
reasoning,
i
think,
you
see
the
third
circuit
wasn't
confronted
with
a
breached
claim
in
the
situation
before
and
therefore,
the
third
circuit
didn't
decide
that
the
court
of
claims
adopted
the
reasoning
of
the
third
circuit
alternatively
--
mr.
david
rose
--
and
did
apply
it
to
both
and
we
think
that
results
in
the
trial
of
12,
15
years
afterwards
of
claims
concerning
facts,
which
occurred
that
many
years
before,
and
we
don't
think
--
we
think
it's
clear
that
this
is
not
what
congress
intended.
mr.
david
rose
yes.
mr.
david
rose
yes
that's
quite
right.
and
obviously,
the
consequences
are
not
as
severe
in
the
third
circuit
rule
as
they
are
in
the
court
of
claims
rule,
but
they
are
nevertheless
severe,
because
if
the
contractor
is
not
diligent
in
prosecuting,
there
are
rare
instances
in
the
united
states
steel
case
is
certainly
an
extreme
example,
but
there's
one
that
is
example
of
the
case,
which
is
pending
administratively
for
many,
many
years
and
certainly
the
underlying
facts
in
regard
to
any
breached
claim
in
that
kind
of
situation
would
in
all
probability
have
long
since
disappeared
by
the
time
they
brought
their
action
to
court.
so,
we
think
the
same
kind
of
consequences
are
inherently
involved.
they're
more
severe
in
the
court
of
claims
situation
than
they
are
in
the
third
circuit,
but
we
don't
think
the
congress
intended
either.
i
see
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
david
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
we
had

years
afterwards
of
claims
concerning
facts,
which
occurred
that
many
years
before,
and
we
don't
think
--
we
think
it's
clear
that
this
is
not
what
congress
intended.
mr.
david
rose
yes.
mr.
david
rose
yes
that's
quite
right.
and
obviously,
the
consequences
are
not
as
severe
in
the
third
circuit
rule
as
they
are
in
the
court
of
claims
rule,
but
they
are
nevertheless
severe,
because
if
the
contractor
is
not
diligent
in
prosecuting,
there
are
rare
instances
in
the
united
states
steel
case
is
certainly
an
extreme
example,
but
there's
one
that
is
example
of
the
case,
which
is
pending
administratively
for
many,
many
years
and
certainly
the
underlying
facts
in
regard
to
any
breached
claim
in
that
kind
of
situation
would
in
all
probability
have
long
since
disappeared
by
the
time
they
brought
their
action
to
court.
so,
we
think
the
same
kind
of
consequences
are
inherently
involved.
they're
more
severe
in
the
court
of
claims
situation
than
they
are
in
the
third
circuit,
but
we
don't
think
the
congress
intended
either.
i
see
my
time
is
expired.
