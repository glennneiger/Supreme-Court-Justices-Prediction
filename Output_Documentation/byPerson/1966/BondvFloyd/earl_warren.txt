chief

well,
has
he
been
exuded
for
two
of
his
terms
or
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
the
first
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
march
of
what
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
march
of
what
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1966?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
mean
whether
the
legislature
agrees
with
the
views
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
expressed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
language
do
you
point
to
in
this
--
in
what
he
said
to
arrive
at
that
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let's
see
where
it
--
just
what
he
said
that's
rather
important.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
know
just
what
he
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
138.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
if
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
write
that,
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
he
stated
his
reasons
why
he
endorsed
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
think
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
you
have
told
us
that
you're
relying
on
the
section
of
the
constitution
which
requires
every
state
legislator
to
take
the
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
constitution
that
gives
a
right
to
anyone
to
judge
the
sincerity
of
a
legislator
who
is
willing
to
take
that
oath?
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
you
is
that
do
you
--
that
section,
if
an
elected
officer
is
willing
to
and
offers
to
take
that
oath,
is
there
anything
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
authorizes
anyone
under
any
circumstances,
to
pass
upon
his
sincerity
in
taking
that
oath?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
i
would
like
to
know
why
--
how
you
jump
from
that
to
the
fact
that
the
legislature
of
georgia
has
a
right
to
test
the
sincerity
of
this
man
in
taking
that
oath?
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
he
judged
that
the
--
he
passed
judgment
on
mr.
bond
to
the
effect
that
mr.
bond
would
not
--
was
not
sincere
in
taking
that
oath.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
now
what
--
you
told
us
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
georgia
constitution
that
directly
confers
with
his
taking
the
oath,
have
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
will
--
i
asked
you
the
same
question
then
about
the
georgia
constitution,
is
there
anything
in
it
that
which
authorizes
anyone
to
pass
upon
the
sincerity
of
a
person
who
takes
the
oath
as
prescribed
by
the
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
where
--
what
do
you
refer
to
in
the
georgia
constitution
that
authorizes
--
the
legislature
to
pass
upon
the
sincerity
of
this
man
in
his
willingness
to
take
the
oath?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
agree
with
the
court
but
you
think
that
the
legislature
did
not
and
that
therefore
they
have
the
right
to
exclude
mr.
bond?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
don't
we
also
have
the
problem
of
determining
whether
the
house
have
the
right
to
judge
him
on
this
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
alright,
what
to
--
what
is
their
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
they
decided
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
take
his
seat
because
he
parted
his
hair
wrong
that
that
would
be
for
an
unconstitutional
reasons,
would
that
give
us
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
they
have
properly
ejected
him
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
dividing
line
between
our
jurisdiction
and
no
jurisdiction
in
judging
of
the
actions
of
the
legislature
in
this
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
we
would
have
jurisdictions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
we
thought
that
the
legislature
had
no
right
to
judge
of
the
sincerity
of
the
man
in
taking
the
oath,
then
we
would
have
a
right
to
say
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
nullify
the
action
of
the
legislature.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boudin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
116?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
justice
clark
just
suggested,
is
a
pacifist,
he
could
claim
this
(inaudible),
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
would
solve
that
problem,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
i
understand
his
statement,
it
seems
to
me
like
the
firm
authorize
a
statement,
he
is
against
that
law,
he
didn't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
that
he
doesn't
intend
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
church.
it
seems
to
me
like
that's
a
potential
he
has
that
he
--
it's
a
view
he
has.
are
you
depending
now
on
the
ground
that
this
statement
can
be
construed
in
some
fashion
as
meaning
that
he
doesn't
want
that
law
violated?
