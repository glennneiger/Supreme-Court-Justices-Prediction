justice

is

another

i'm

well,

not
freedom

equivalent
to
free

is
it

--
which
is

justice

well,
that's
rather

an
important
difference
because
there
isn't
one
about
freedom
of

justice

so,
if

justice

mr.

when
does
the

justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
mr.
boudin
that
you
think
of
this
and
submit
that
this
is
quite
a
different
case
from
the
one
that
might
be
presented
if
mr.
bond
or
anybody
else
were
expelled
from
a
legislature
for
violation
of

on

rather
strict

rules
of

and
courtesy
as

and

and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
now
why?
justice
potter
stewart
two-thirds
vote
required
to
expel
somebody?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
have
in
mind
cases
at
the
federal
level
like
--
at
least
were
not
expulsion
cases
but
they
were
discipline
cases
of
--
by
the
united
states
senate
of
the
late
senator
mccarthy
and
before
that
of
his
predecessors
under
hiram
bingham
of
the
connecticut
who
was
censured
by
the
senate
for
exercising
what
he
might
call
his
constitutional
right
of
association
for
bringing
of
--
well
obvious
under
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
senator
mccarthy,
i
supposed
was
censured
for
the
exercise
of
what
he
might
consider
his
freedom
of
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
and
i
suppose
in
an
extreme
enough
case
--
national
or
state
legislature
could
--
and
would
have
historic
power
to
expel
the
member
for
gross
violation
of
its
ground
rules.
would
you
question
that
even
if
it
involves
simply
a
speech?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it
were
of
vulgar
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
fancy
speech
in
repeated
violation
of
its
rules
as
to
how
the
legislature
was
to
do
business.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
the
case
of
senator
hiram
bingham
of
connecticut
was
his
freedom
of
association.
justice
potter
stewart
expression
of
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that's
quite
a
different
case
from
a
case
where
the
charge
--
where
it
was
that
he
repeatedly
violated
the
rule
that
all
opinion
inside
the
house
should
be
addressed
to
the
chair
for
example,
rather
than
directly
at
another
member.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
should
suppose
that
we
--
you
would
go
even
further
than
my
brother
harlan
suggest
and
say
that
the
questions
of
georgia
law
are
none
of
the
business
of
this
court
and
we
have
to
assume
that
when
the
state
legislature
proceeded
as
it
did,
it
was
expressing
what
the
law
of
georgia
is.
and
the
only
questions
for
us
is,
is
whether
the
action
of
that
state
legislature
violated
the
united
states
constitution.
