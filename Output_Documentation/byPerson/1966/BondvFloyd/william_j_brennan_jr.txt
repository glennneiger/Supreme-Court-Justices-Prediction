justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
newly
elected
assembly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
mean
this
recent
one
go
to
the
newly
elected
assembly
that
was
--
he
was
elected
last
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
second
action
you
said
was
a
committee
recommendation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
--
is
that
recommendation
was
to
be
acted
upon
by
the
legislator
elected
last
tuesday?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
may
or
may
not
include
mr.
bond?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
attorney
general,
i'm
a
little
confused
about
this.
isn't
that
--
that
legislature
is
now
out
of
office,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
will
be
on
january
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
action
can
the
legislature
--
the
newly
elected
legislature
take
in
respect
of
his
being
seated
in
the
legislature
that
no
longer
exists.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
can't
even
see
what
the
newly
convened
legislature
can
now
do
about
his
being
seated
in
the
legislature
which
no
longer
exists.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
is
this
recommendation
then
to
--
have
any
relation
to
his
election
last
tuesday?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
must
say
then
i
don't
understand
what
possible
action
the
newly
elected
legislature
can
take
in
this
recommendation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
all
that
you
rely
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
all
you
rely
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
all
that
you
rely
on
to
say
that
he
advocated
violation
of
the
law
and
disobedience
to
the
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
--
i
do
not
advocate
that
people
should
break
laws.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
then
why
isn't
justice
white's
question
pertinent?
there
must
have
been
a
finding
if
they
didn't
believe
that
when
he
said
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you've
already
said
that
that
support
to
constitution
doesn't
mean
that
i
will
not
disagree.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
wouldn't
he
--
in
order
not
to
--
he
wouldn't
participate
in
the
war,
he
would
have
to
have
some
other
recognized
excuses
for
not
going.
on
the
conscientious
objection
that's
beyond
a
religious
basis,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
it
has
anything
to
do
with
religion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
still
has
to
be
on
a
religious
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
more
than
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
more
than
conscience?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
is
the
