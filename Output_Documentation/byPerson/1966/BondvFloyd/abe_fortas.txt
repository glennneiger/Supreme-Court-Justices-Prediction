justice
abe
fortas
mr.
boudin,
supposed
a
person
were
elected
to
the
board
--
to
the
legislature
though
--
and
he
had
publicly
advocated
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
georgia
and
its
replacement
by
a
communist
government
or
by
a
military
dictatorship
or
whatever,
extreme
example
or
alternatively
occurs
to
your
mind,
where
were
that
leave
the
problem
as
a
matter
of
principle?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
understand.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
boudin,
you
are
(voice
overlap),
don't
rely
at
all
on
section
4,
article
4
of
the
constitution,
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
guarantee
to
the
states
a
republican
form
of
government.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
in
your
brief,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
state
legislature
without
any
reason,
without
ascribing
any
reason
whatever,
refused
to
permit
a
person
who
had
been
elected
to
the
take
office.
he
said,
"we're
not
going
to
permit
you
to
do
it",
no
free
speech
issue
in
this
brought
by
legislative
resolution.
i
suppose
it
could
be
argued
that
this
probably
is
a
person
is
being
deprived
of
a
right.
but
would
that
conceptually
different,
is
it
fact
that
this
is
at
first
amendment
right
that
gives
a
federal
government
power
here?
and
if
it
were
not
the
first
amendment
involved
here
but
let's
say,
summary
action
i
--
perhaps
the
violation
of
due
process
or
the
fellow
have
attained
their
standing
alone.
would
that
give
the
--
would
that
mean
that
in
no
circums
--
would
your
argument
mean
that
no
circumstances,
the
federal
judiciary
could
do
nothing
about
it
whereas
the
first
amendment
involvement
here
is
the
triggering
factor.
justice
abe
fortas
but
doesn't
that
get
us
immediately
into
all
state
elections?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
you
get
the
next
question
which
is
why,
how,
on
what
theory
does
the
first
amendment
operate
in
that
fashion.
why
doesn't
the
due
process
clause
trigger
it?
that
is
to
say,
why
doesn't
the
--
or
recurring
this
bill
of
attainder
type
of
action
trigger.
why
the
first
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
does
due
process
trigger?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
can
say
that
it
--
and
it'd
be
difficult
for
us
state
to
take
the
position
and
it
has
a
republican
form
of
government
if
it
denies
to
the
persons
who
have
by
hypothesis
been
duly
elected
the
opportunity
to
take
their
seat
in
legislature.
i
can
see
that
possibility.
but
if
you
take
the
next
step
and
say
that
section
4
of
article
4
is
in
this
situation
as
this
court
has
held
it,
it
could
be
another
situation
is
nonjusticiable.
then
i
have
a
little
problem
in
going
from
the
--
this
question
of
state
power
to
the
question
federal
power.
justice
abe
fortas
does
he
have
a
claim
for
payment
of
salary?
justice
abe
fortas
did
mr.
bond
show
up
after
the
special
election
and
offered
to
take
the
oath
of
office?
justice
abe
fortas
and
permission
was
refused?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
official
state
action?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
as
of
now,
with
respect
to
mr.
bond's
second
election,
that
is
the
special
election,
we
have
a
closed
book.
now
we
--
that
is
to
say
in
a
sense
that
he
offered
to
take
the
election
--
take
the
oath
of
office
and
the
state
refused
to
permit
him
to
take
the
oath
of
office.
and
so
that
stands
the
same
footing
as
the
first
one.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
statements
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
sncc
statement
on
137?
i
suppose
that's
closer
to
your
point
that
the
statement
of
the
fact
that
we're
in
sympathy
within
the
support
and
then
we're
unwilling
to
respond
to
the
draft.
justice
abe
fortas
a
what?
justice
abe
fortas
don't
you
also
say
that
it's
not
of
the
judiciary's
business
any
way.
i
would
think
you
do
if
it's
a
political
question.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
been
any
--
to
your
knowledge,
is
there
been
any
debate
in
the
georgia
legislature
about
the
war
in
vietnam?
is
there
any
member
of
the
georgia
legislature
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
member
of
the
georgia
legislature
who
has
ever
expressed
himself
as
opposed
to
our
participation
in
that
war
to
your
knowledge?
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
understand
your
argument
to
comes
peerlessly
close
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you,
it
may
come
peerlessly
close
to
suggesting
that
if
a
legislator
suggest
such
views
then
he
is
not
qualified
to
take
his
oath
even
if
he's
subsequently
reelected
and
getting
--
supporting
with
question
of
removal
he
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
subsequently
reelected
and
presents
himself
to
take
his
oath.
he
is
opposed
to
the
war
in
vietnam
or
that
--
that'd
be
grounds
for
refusing
the
--
to
allow
him
to
take
the
oath.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
sir
but
don't
you
have
to
help
us
a
little
bit
my
--because
i
understand
your
position,
this
case
in
principle
is
as
if
mr.
bond
set
out
here
to
take
the
oath
and
at
the
same
time
he
said,
"i
am
not
going
to
observe
the
oath,
i
am
not
going
to
obey
the
constitution
of
the
united
states".
that
it
seems
to
me
is
the
principle
that
you're
presenting
to
us,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
don't
you
have
to
tell
us
just
where
mr.
bond
made
such
a
statement
that
you
alleged
to
be
contrary
to
the
oath,
as
to
where
it
is
and
what
precisely
you're
relying
on?
you
read
--
i
know
you
referred
the
two
passages
but
--
and
if
those
are
all
that
you're
relying
on,
well,
we
ought
to
know
that.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
has
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
take
the
next
sentence?
justice
abe
fortas
they
have
to
take
that
next
sentence
though
mr.
attorney
general,
don't
you
on
page
112
after
saying,
as
second
class
citizen,
i
don't
think
that
i
have
a
requirement
to
support
that
or
he
went
on
to
say,
"i
think
my
responsibility
is
to
oppose
things
that
i
think
are
wrong
if
they
are
in
vietnam
or
new
york".
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
there
is
some
ambiguity
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
precisely
with
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
attorney
general,
as
i
understand
your
previous
argument,
the
statement
that
now
that
mr.
bond
advocated
violation
of
selective
service
act,
doesn't
seem
to
be
supported
by
anything
in
the
record.
do
you
--
with
--
what
is
your
contention,
that
it
is
or
is
not
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
that
that
is
advocating
violation
of
the
selective
service
act?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
the
provisional
on
which
you're
relying?
justice
abe
fortas
or
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
i
cannot
personally
participate
in
the
war,
no
more.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
pretty
much
indicated
that
he
would
not
participate
in
the
war.
he
said,
"i
cannot
participate
in
war".
justice
