mr.
boudin
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
critical
to
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
you
could
--
you
would
still
think
you're
entitled
to
judgment
even
if
you
answered
mr.
justice
harlan
the
other
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
said
i
will
take
the
oath
and
then
renounce
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you're
wrong?
what
if
--
what
if
you
--
what
if
you're
wrong
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
would
not
be
entitled
to
take
the
--
take
your
office
if
that
have
been
secured?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
still
--
at
least
be
left
with
the
issue
whether
what
happened
here
was
tantamount
to
that
hypothetical?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there's
a
question
mr.
attorney
general
as
to
what
being
bound
to
support
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
for
a
moment
that
a
legislature
--
a
legislator
is
being
unfaithful
to
his
oath
if
he
says,
"i
think
the
first
amendment
should
be
amended.
i
don't
agree
with
it".
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
he
is
--
did
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
because
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
could
disagree.
you
can
disagree
with
the
policy
stated
in
some
provisions
in
the
constitution
and
still
support
it
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
if
we
are
really
we're
saying
then
that
the
--
that
mr.
bond
could
state
his
views
in
opposition
to
policy,
to
the
policy
of
the
constitution
or
the
policy
of
the
law
of
the
united
states?
you
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
i
suppose
that
if
he
said,
"i
will
not
obey
the
constitution",
that
is
a
wholly
different
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
that
what's
he
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
that
is
what
he
said
that
he
will
not
obey
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
he
himself
denies
that
that's
what
he
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he
said
specifically
that
he
endorsed
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
agreed
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
issue
that
--
what
he
--
under
--
that
he
endorsed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
a
while
ago
you
said
that
the
different
with
government
policy
and
the
policy
of
the
constitution,
with
purpose
is
permissible
that
a
man
shouldn't
be
excluded
from
the
legislature
for
that
reason,
just
for
disagreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
you
have
thought
there
was
advocacy,
a
violation
of
the
law
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
of
the
constitution.
now,
what
if
the
--
in
the
hearing
for
--
on
mr.
bond's
qualification,
mr.
bond
says,
"well,
i
understand
you
think
that
i
advocated
breaking
the
law
but
i
assure
you
i
don't
--
i
didn't
advocate
it
so
for
as
i
know
and
i
don't
advocate.
and
if
i
did,
i
renounce
what
i
said,
i
--
all
i
mean
is
that
i
do
not
advocate
breaking
the
laws".
now,
did
that
occur
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
--
do
you
think
the
legislature
excluded
him
because
they
thought
he
advocated
the
breaking
of
the
law
and
that
they
didn't
believe
his
disavowal?
is
that
what
you're
bringing
up
here
that
he
should
--
this
exclusion
should
be
affirmed
because
mr.
bond
advocated
disobedient
to
the
federal
constitution
or
the
federal
laws?
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
--
you
have
to
then
say
the
legislature
found
that
he
--
didn't
believe
him
on
his
disavowal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
did
say
in
so
many
words.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
already
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
--
the
gloss
you
put
on
that
is
that
--
what
it
means
is
that
the
man
will
not
abide
by
the
constitution,
would
disobey
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
he
says,
i
don't
mean
that.
i
didn't
mean
that
and
i
don't
mean
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that
statement
mean
to
you?
he
has
no
obligation
to
support
the
war.
or
does
it
mean
that
no
obligation
to
agree
with
it?
does
that
mean
to
you
that
he
was
not
--
that
he
would
break
the
law
in
order
no
to
support
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
what
it
meant
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
be
--
he
could
not
go
off
to
war
and
still
be
obeying
the
law?
