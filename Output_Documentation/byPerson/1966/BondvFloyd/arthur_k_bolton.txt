mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
as
has
been
safely
apparent
from
the
discussion
of
the
problem
before
this
court
today
is
a
great
historical
significance
not
because
the
georgia
legislature
is
the
only
legislative
body
which
has
ever
refused
to
seat
a
member
in
judging
his
qualifications.
but
because
this
is
the
first
time
insofar
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
that
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
have
ever
been
before
the
supreme
court.
indeed
historically,
there
seems
to
be
a
lack
of
precedent
for
this
case
to
be
here.
but
i
should
concede
in
candor
that
in
view
of
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
history
alone
does
not
control
nor
indeed
should
it
control
and
without
waiting
or
conceding
any
of
the
arguments
raised
in
our
brief,
i
will
consign
our
argument
to
the
basic
constitutional
questions
raised
and
the
basic
constitutional
rights
of
mr.
bond
which
this
court
may
find
it
necessary
to
determine.
when
the
julian
bond's
story
broke
the
new
york
times
interviewed
louie
loreman
who
was
one
of
the
five
socialist
who
were
expelled
by
the
new
york
legislature
in
1919.
it
inquired
why
no
court
action
had
been
taken
by
them
at
that
time,
said
mr.
loreman.
we
regard
the
concept
of
separation
of
powers
as
far
more
important
than
own
case.
if
judges
can
decide
who
can
seat
in
the
legislature
then
they
can
decide
who
shouldn't
seat.
this
would
be
a
much
greater
offense
to
a
democratic
government
than
anything
a
stupid
majority
of
legislators
might
do
in
an
individual
case.
so
i
think
it
will
be
readily
agreed
therefore
that
this
is
a
first
impression
case
before
this
court.
and
that
is
it
may
for
the
first
time
construe
the
power
of
a
legislative
body
in
determining
qualification
of
its
selected
membership,
it
is
of
paramount
importance.
the
question
concerning
mr.
bond's
election
and
his
subsequent
election
except
for
the
fact
that
he
has
not
been
refused
a
seat
by
the
second
legislature,
it
is
merely
the
committee's
recommendation
which
will
go
to
the
general
assembly
next
january.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
he
is
not
in
dispute.
mr.
bond
has
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
there
has
been
no
contest
to
his
election
on
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
he
was
excluded
for
the
term
upon
which
this
suit
is
predicated.
then
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
then
the
governor
in
conformity
with
the
law
called
a
special
election.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
mr.
bond
ran
and
was
overwhelmingly
reelected.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
was
this
year
march,
the
legislature
was
in
recess,
a
special
(voice
overlap)
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
sir?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
march
of
1966.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
the
legislature
was
in
recess,
a
committee
convened
and
met
and
made
a
recommendation
that
he'd
be
not
seated
but
it
has
not
been
acted
on
by
the
legislative
which
doesn't
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
it
will
be
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
whatever
it
determines
your
honor,
if
i
understand
the
reason
that
he
ran
was
to
be
able
to
serve
on
committees
during
the
recess
of
the
legislature.
but
actually
as
the
--
your
honor
points
out,
any
recommendation
of
this
committee
would
not
be
binding
on
the
newly
convened
legislature.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
they
cannot.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
you
mean
the
recommendation
of
the
legislature
this
year,
this
committee?
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
newly
elected
legislature,
if
the
time
--
if
his
qualification
to
our
challenge
they
may
or
may
not
be
challenged.
but
i
think
if
that
time
would
have
to
determine
it
for
themselves.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
would
presume
yes
sir
that
he
did
present
himself.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
you
are
correct
your
honor,
yes
sir.
we
will
therefore
try
to
the
deal
is
--
briefly
as
possible
in
the
time
allotted
us,
those
constitutional
questions
which
we
think
may
concern
the
court
in
arriving
at
a
decision.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
understand
the
word
qualifications,
may
it
please
the
court,
to
mean
the
qualifications
imposed
in
the
georgia
constitution
and
also
the
qualification
imposed
by
article
vi,
clause
3
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
the
qualifications
of
the
georgia
constitution,
may
it
please
the
court,
opposed
which
are
usually
contained
in
state
constitutions
saying
that
he'd
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
21
years
of
age,
citizen
of
georgia
for
two
years
and
the
rest
of
that
--
of
the
county
from
which
elected
of
the
district
from
which
elected
for
one
year
and
it
has
other
provisions
in
the
georgia
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
any
in
the
georgia
constitution?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
nothing
except
the
qualification
as
contained
in
the
georgia
constitution
your
honor
that
he'd
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
we
have
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
would
think
that
with
the
qualification
of
article
vi,
clause
3
of
the
federal
constitution,
we
do
have
nominal
qualifications.
of
course
he
can't
owe
money
to
the
state
and
there
are
some
specific
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that's
right,
cannot
be
indebted
to
the
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
is
not
involved
here,
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
court
please,
the
qualifications
contained
in
the
federal
constitution,
article
vi,
clause
3
which
requires
that
a
state
legislator
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
because
of
a
--
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
we
think
to
be
a
paramount
qualifications.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
i
think
that
it'd
be
construction
of
course,
it's
up
to
this
court
to
construe
that
provision
of
the
constitution.
but
i
think
that
that
provision
means
and
is
a
qualification
that
a
person
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
it's
imposed
on
the
congress
upon
the
legislative
and
executive
branch
and
the
judiciary
of
the
several
states
in
article
vi,
clause
3.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
taken
to
forbid
the
expression
of
views.
but
i
think
if
a
person
which
i
will
try
to
develop,
i
think
if
a
challenge
is
unopposed
that
the
legislature
can
hear
it.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
can
hear
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
determining
qualifications.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well
i
don't
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
court
knows
i
can't
state
that
nearly
because
the
legislature
merely
disagreed
with
the
views
of
a
member
who
was
being
seated
that
he
could
not
be
seated.
but
i
think
that
the
legislature
in
a
hearing
to
determine
the
qualifications
under
article
vi,
clause
3
of
the
united
states
constitution
that
a
member
of
a
state
legislature
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
can
hear
any
relevant
evidence
which
bears
on
his
qualifications
to
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir
and
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
because
his
advocating
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
he
is
advocating
an
amendment
of
the
law
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
i
think
the
states
will
also
along
i
think
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
i
think
mr.
bond
can
state
his
views.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
i
speak
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
am
not
trying
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
i
think
he
advocated
violation
of
the
laws.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
mr.
bond
stated
as
set
out
in
the
opinion
that
he
would
advocate
it
that
those
who
violate
--
anyone
violate
the
selective
service
act
for
any
reason
which
they
saw
fit.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
alright
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
record
page
138.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
may
i
read?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
during
a
taped
interview
with
the
representative
of
the
media,
mr.
bond
after
endorsing
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
statement
was
asked
why
he
endorsed
it
and
his
answer
was
as
follows.
why?
endorse
it
--
this,
because
i
like
to
think
of
myself
as
a
pacifist
and
one
who
opposes
that
war
and
any
other
war
and
eager
and
anxious
to
encourage
people
not
to
participate
in
it
for
any
reason
that
they
choose.
and
secondly,
i
agree
with
the
statement
because
of
the
reasons
set
forth
in
it.
because
i
think
it
is
so
hypocritical
for
us
to
maintain
that
we
are
fighting
for
liberty
in
other
places
and
we
are
not
guaranteeing
freedom
to
citizens
inside
the
continental
united
states.
further
reading,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
they
asked
if
he
thought
his
views
were
at
variance
with
the
duties
that
might
be
required
of
him
as
a
representative
in
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
state
of
georgia,
mr.
bond
replied,
"well
i
think
the
fact
that
the
united
states
government
fights
a
war
in
vietnam.
i
don't
think
that
i
as
a
second
class
citizen
of
the
united
states
have
a
requirement
to
support
that
war.
i
think
my
responsibility
is
to
oppose
things
that
i
think
are
wrong,
if
they
are
in
vietnam
or
new
york
or
chicago
or
atlanta
or
whatever".
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
sir?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
could
--
i
am
sorry,
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
--
let
me
explain
to
the
court.
this
entire
statement
--
excuse
me.
the
entire
statement
of
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
was
read
into
the
record
at
the
hearing.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
he
didn't
write
it
but
he
was
--
publicity
and
i
don't
think
he
is
--
i
think
if
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
that
he
was
a
student
--
i
mean
he
was
the
publicity
direct
for
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
at
the
hearing,
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
it
was
read
to
him
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
he
endorsed
it
and
said
he
reaffirmed
his
endorsement
of
it
at
the
hearing.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
they
were
opposed
to
the
national
foreign
policy.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
would
hold
that
was
constitutional,
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
obviously
sir,
i
think
the
same
reason
therewith.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
the
same
reasoning
would
apply
there.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
same
reason,
yes
sir.
it
is
our
position,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
qualifications
imposed
in
the
georgia
constitution,
all
the
member
of
the
georgia
--
by
the
georgia
constitution.
i
want
to
say,
but
there
there's
another
constitution
imposed
by
the
u.s.
constitution
article
vi,
clause
3
which
of
course
we
joined
issue
and
there's
not
being
a
promissory
oath
that
that
is
a
qualification
imposed
by
the
framers
of
our
constitution.
now
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
why?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
qualification
that
an
elected
representative
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think,
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
he
would
be
bound
to
say
it
and
he
would
be,
if
he
--
please
the
court,
that
that
would
be
a
qualification
that
he
possessed
at
that
time
that
he
said.
now,
i
agree
that
this
issue
has
not
been
raised.
i've
learned
a
great
deal
about
the
--
i
think
our
constitution
in
studying
this
facts
in
this
case.
but
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
one
of
the
reasons
this
issue
hasn't
been
raised
is
because
of
the
fact
that
certainly
for
the
past
hundred
years,
we
have
had
orderly
government.
we
have
had
a
government
under
the
constitution
in
this
country.
and
one
of
my
states,
georgia,
was
one
that
participated
in
the
civil
war.
but
it
was
only
when
those
members
of
the
legislature
violated
this
oath.
violated
disqualification
if
you
please
the
court,
that
we
had
chaos
in
the
country,
that
this
is
a
fundamental
point,
a
fundamental
thing
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
wanted,
put
in
to
the
constitution
by
the
members
of
congress,
not
only
congress
but
of
the
state
legislators.
may
i
say
in
the
state
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that's
right
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
that
line
of
questioning
didn't
occur
here.
mr.
bond
--
i
believe
mr.
bond
did
say
that
he
didn't
encourage
others
to
burn
their
draft
card
that
he
had
his
own
draft
card
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
one
of
the
reasons
your
honor.
we
think
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
legislature
in
hearing
the
evidence
in
judging
his
qualifications
found
that
he
would
not
qualify
to
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
he
did
say
that.
that
was
evidence
in
his
favor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
of
course.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
was
for
evidence
for
the
house
to
consider.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
may
i
read
the
provision
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
its
very
short,
article
vi,
clause
3.
the
senators
and
representatives
before
mentioned,
and
the
members
of
the
several
state
legislatures,
and
all
executives
and
judicial
officers,
both
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
several
states,
shall
be
bound
by
oath
or
affirmation,
to
support
this
constitution;
but
no
religious
test
shall
ever
be
required
as
a
qualification,
a
qualification
to
any
office
or
public
trust
under
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
not
in
the
united
states
constitution
sir,
except
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
to
state
my
position
to
that.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
but
we
--
of
course
this
--
he
was
--
one
of
the
allegation,
one
of
the
challenge
unopposed
stated
that
he
was
not
qualified
under
this
provision
of
the
u.s.
constitution
and
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
one
of
the
challenges
to
mr.
bond's
being
seated.
and
the
georgia
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
statement,
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
it
would
be.
but
the
provisions
for
the
house
to
judge
it
--
the
georgia
house
of
course
is
not
in
the
constitution.
that
relates
back
to
the
georgia
constitution,
the
provision
that
the
house
shall
be
that
sole
judge
of
the
qualification
in
election
of
its
members.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
provision
of
the
georgia
constitution
itself
which
the
oath
proscribes
in
the
constitution
requires
to
a
person
to
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
not
in
those
words
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
so
the
only
thing
that
i
can
assume
--
i
hope
we
understand,
the
legislature
acts
independently.
the
legislature
found
authority
under
the
qualification
provision
of
the
georgia
constitution,
that
they
were
sole
judge
of
the
qualifications
of
a
member
to
that
house.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
as
to
qualifications?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
we
have
no
state
court
decisions
as
construed
in
this
provision
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
statement.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
later
on
in
my
argument
i
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
get
--
touch
on
that
issue
as
to
the
due
process.
so
it
is
our
position
that
the
federal
constitution
provides
a
minimum
qualification,
the
only
qualification
there.
may
i
go
back
one
moment
because
of
course
i
digress
--
you
might
--
the
court
might
say
is,
this
is
a
--
why,
why
does
the
u.s.
constitution,
why
is
that
important?
well,
why
is
a
state
legislature,
why
is
that
important?
we
have
50
states
and
i've
said
in
the
state
legislature
and
why
is
that
an
important
position?
well,
may
i
just
very
briefly
state
that
a
state
legislator
doesn't
just
make
laws
that
affect
the
people
in
his
district.
a
state
legislator
makes
laws
which
affect
the
people
of
the
entire
state
of
which
he
is
a
member
without
the
record
modes
of
transportation
now.
a
state
legislator
makes
laws
which
affect
the
people
of
the
entire
nation.
but
not
only
that
and
to
have
a
constitutional
form
of
government,
there
is
a
single
member
of
a
state
legislature
could
theoretically
be
or
could
theoretically
cares
the
deciding
vote
in
--
as
to
whether
or
not
the
united
states
constitution
itself,
an
amendment
thereto
was
ratified.
so
it
is
an
important
office.
now
when
mr.
bond
--
when
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
issued
this
statement
on
january
the
6th,
mr.
bond
made
his
statements
on
it
and
then
the
legislature
of
the
house
convened
on
january
the
5th.
mr.
bond
was
an
elected
representative
which
we
maintain
with
all
except
the
foul
qualification
that
of
being
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
there
is
a
necessity
for
free
speech
under
the
constitution.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
repeat
that
to
this
court.
it
ensures
the
process
of
orderly
government.
this
court
has
imposed
limitations
on
free
speech,
the
known
line
in
cases
of
obscenity
and
in
the
advocacy
of
law
of
violation.
it
is
our
position
that
mr.
bond
in
adapting
the
statement
of
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
and
in
his
statements
thereon
advocated
violation
of
the
selective
service
act.
and
therefore
his
speech
was
not
protected
but
even
assuming
that
his
speech
was
protected,
we
have
to
remember
mr.
bond's
position,
he
was
not
a
citizen.
he
was
a
--
in
a
position
of
a
public
servant
making
comments
reflecting
upon
his
qualifications,
the
qualifications
imposed
by
the
federal
constitution.
the
georgia
house,
under
the
georgia
constitution
is
the
sole
judge
of
his
qualification.
and
we
think
that
because
mr.
bond
of
his
elective
position,
he
had
a
great
responsibility
and
obligation
than
that
of
an
ordinary
citizen
and
that
was
the
qualification
which
he
was
to
be
bound
to
support
the
united
states
constitution.
and
therefore
we
say,
that
in
this
instance
and
under
these
circumstances,
the
sixth
article,
article
vi
of
the
constitution
is
of
equal
rank
and
dignity
with
the
bill
of
rights
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
and
that
the
legislature
in
acting
as
a
judge
of
his
qualifications
was
authorized
to
treat
article
vi
of
the
federal
constitution
as
controlling
insofar
as
determining
his
qualifications.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i'm
certain
there
has
been
but
i
have
no
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
don't
--
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
possibly
there
has
been.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
in
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
in
the
abstract
if
i
may,
i
certainly
don't
intended
it,
conveyed
of
this
court,
the
impression
that
no
one
can
have
contrary
views.
but
i
have
to
relate
it
back
to
article
vi
of
the
constitution
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
i
will
cover
that
in
--
on
the
next
page
in
just
a
moment
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
in
the
record
that
we
have
your
honor.
we
state
that
the
georgia
house
was
the
judge
of
mr.
bond's
qualification.
it
was
sitting
as
a
sole
tribune
or
judicial
body
who
were
authorized
to
determine
his
qualifications.
we
say
however
that
the
court
should
protect
mr.
bond's
constitutional
rights
but
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
house
in
judging
qualifications.
now
back
to
question
justice
fortas,
this
statement
by
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
of
course
which
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
read
this
to
the
court
because
it's
of
--
about
two
pages
long
and
my
time
is
getting
very
close.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
mr.
bond
was
called
before
the
house
of
committee
and
on
page
of
111
of
the
record,
the
statement
would
be
found
that
mr.
bond
stated
that
he
was
eager
and
anxious
to
encourage
people
not
to
participate
in
the
war
in
vietnam
for
any
reason
that
they
choose.
now,
this
was
evidenced
for
the
house
to
consider
in
judging
mr.
bond's
qualification.
he
also
said
--
the
record
page
41,
"i
do
not
advocate
that
people
should
break
the
law".
that
was
evidenced
in
his
favor
but
it
was
also
evidence
that
the
house
could
consider.
he
said
from
the
record
on
page
112,
"i
don't
think
that
i
as
a
second
class
citizen
of
the
united
states
have
a
requirement
to
support
the
law".
this
also
was
evidenced
that
the
house
could
consider.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
sir,
i
hate
to
answer
you
in
this
manner
but
i
don't
think
it's
important
--
is
to
what
it
means
to
me
as
what
it
could
have
meant
to
the
people
who
were
sitting
as
his
judges
at
that
time
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
for
his
qualification.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
sir?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
wherever
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
there
is
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
would
concede
that,
yes
your
honor.
i
can't
say
to
this
court
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that
i
could
say
that
it's
imposed
in
all
its
citizen's
right
to
support
the
war
in
vietnam.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
i
am.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
don't
say
that
that
statement
taken
in
and
of
itself,
may
it
please
the
court,
would
authorize
it
but
i
think
that
the
legislature
was
a
judge
of
his
qualification.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
he
as
a
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
i
agree
with
the
court.
when
the
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
sir
i
think
--
if
i
can
just
summarize.
i
think
that
the
legislature
was
a
judge
of
his
qualification,
a
184
members
in
the
vote
thought
he
wasn't
qualified,
12
members
voted
to
seat
him.
what
the
standard
of
review,
i
think
that
the
lower
court
was
correct
in
stating
a
rational
basis
was
the
standard
of
view
--
of
review.
i
don't
think
we're
concern
with
whether
or
not
another
forum
might
have
judged
bond
differently
but
we
are
concerned
with
the
fact,
was
there
are
any
evidence
upon
which
the
georgia
house
could
form
a
rational
basis
for
finding
him
disqualified
under
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well
your
honor,
we
say
that
the
provision
of
the
constitution
itself
is
a
qualification,
the
federal
constitution.
and
that
the
house,
the
georgia
house
of
representatives
under
the
georgia
constitution
is
a
sole
judge
of
the
qualification
of
its
members
and
if
therefore
the
house
had
a
right
to
judge
of
his
qualification
and
was
the
only
body
that
could
judge
of
his
qualification
as
contained
in
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
we
say
that
that
is
a
qualification,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i'm
not
trying
to
avoid
the
issue
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
now,
if
they
do
it
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
if
they
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
because
they
don't
like
the
way
(inaudible)
your
hair.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
constitutional
and
i
think
this
court
could
so
hold
(voice

--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
it
would
--
wouldn't
be
--
have
a
due
process,
excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
part
of
it
would
be
possible.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
if
he
advocated
that
other
people
violate
the
law
then
it
would
be
possible
to
someone
to
--
and
not
choose
and
oppose
the
challenge
to
his
qualifications.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
after
the
legislature
heard
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
still
(inaudible)
from
the
governor's
brief
that
it
is
a
fact.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
this
court
in
such
an
instance
as
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
could
take
jurisdiction,
yes
under
such
instances
as
that.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well
sir
as
i
understand
the
law
would
be
determined
as
to
whether
or
not
a
person's
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes,
i
think
so.
if
i
may
just
summarize
briefly.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
we
say
that
the
qualification
imposed
in
the
constitution
was
judged
by
the
georgia
house.
we
don't
think
mr.
bond's
rights
under
the
first
amendment
were
violated
because
we
think
that
the
speech
--
parts
of
the
speech
which
he
made
could
be
reasonably
interpreted
as
advocating
violation
of
the
selective
service
act.
but
even
if
he
--
it'd
be
determined
to
the
speech
of
mr.
bond
would
have
been
protected
as
an
ordinary
citizen,
the
qualification
imposed
by
the
united
states
constitution
has
equaled
dignity
with
the
first
amendment
and
is
not
controlling
and
the
house
was
authorized
to
determine
his
qualification.
we
think
that
mr.
bond
was
afforded
due
process.
his
constitutional
rights
were
protected
as
there
was
some
evidence
upon
which
the
georgia
house
could
make
its
determination
of
his
qualification.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
it's
our
contention
your
honor
that
when
he
said
i
--
urged
citizens
to
--
excuse
me,
i
have
a
reference
to
it
right
here
to
--
he
was
eager
and
anxious
--
the
record
page
on
111.
eager
and
anxious
--
was
he
--
eager
and
anxious
to
encourage
people
not
to
participate
in
it,
the
war,
for
any
reason
that
they
choose.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes,
we
would
on
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
as
has
been
safely
apparent
from
the
discussion
of
the
problem
before
this
court
today
is
a
great
historical
significance
not
because
the
georgia
legislature
is
the
only
legislative
body
which
has
ever
refused
to
seat
a
member
in
judging
his
qualifications.
but
because
this
is
the
first
time
insofar
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
that
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
have
ever
been
before
the
supreme
court.
indeed
historically,
there
seems
to
be
a
lack
of
precedent
for
this
case
to
be
here.
but
i
should
concede
in
candor
that
in
view
of
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
history
alone
does
not
control
nor
indeed
should
it
control
and
without
waiting
or
conceding
any
of
the
arguments
raised
in
our
brief,
i
will
consign
our
argument
to
the
basic
constitutional
questions
raised
and
the
basic
constitutional
rights
of
mr.
bond
which
this
court
may
find
it
necessary
to
determine.
when
the
julian
bond's
story
broke
the
new
york
times
interviewed
louie
loreman
who
was
one
of
the
five
socialist
who
were
expelled
by
the
new
york
legislature
in
1919.
it
inquired
why
no
court
action
had
been
taken
by
them
at
that
time,
said
mr.
loreman.
we
regard
the
concept
of
separation
of
powers
as
far
more
important
than
own
case.
if
judges
can
decide
who
can
seat
in
the
legislature
then
they
can
decide
who
shouldn't
seat.
this
would
be
a
much
greater
offense
to
a
democratic
government
than
anything
a
stupid
majority
of
legislators
might
do
in
an
individual
case.
so
i
think
it
will
be
readily
agreed
therefore
that
this
is
a
first
impression
case
before
this
court.
and
that
is
it
may
for
the
first
time
construe
the
power
of
a
legislative
body
in
determining
qualification
of
its
selected
membership,
it
is
of
paramount
importance.
the
question
concerning
mr.
bond's
election
and
his
subsequent
election
except
for
the
fact
that
he
has
not
been
refused
a
seat
by
the
second
legislature,
it
is
merely
the
committee's
recommendation
which
will
go
to
the
general
assembly
next
january.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
he
is
not
in
dispute.
mr.
bond
has
been
(voice

--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
there
has
been
no
contest
to
his
election
on
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
he
was
excluded
for
the
term
upon
which
this
suit
is
predicated.
then
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
then
the
governor
in
conformity
with
the
law
called
a
special
election.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
mr.
bond
ran
and
was
overwhelmingly
reelected.
mr.

was
in
recess,
a
committee
convened
and
met
and
made
a
recommendation
that
he'd
be
not
seated
but
it
has
not
been
acted
on
by
the
legislative
which
doesn't
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
it
will
be
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
whatever
it
determines
your
honor,
if
i
understand
the
reason
that
he
ran
was
to
be
able
to
serve
on
committees
during
the
recess
of
the
legislature.
but
actually
as
the
--
your
honor
points
out,
any
recommendation
of
this
committee
would
not
be
binding
on
the
newly
convened
legislature.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
they
cannot.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
you
mean
the
recommendation
of
the
legislature
this
year,
this
committee?
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
newly
elected
legislature,
if
the
time
--
if
his
qualification
to
our
challenge
they
may
or
may
not
be
challenged.
but
i
think
if
that
time
would
have
to
determine
it
for
themselves.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
would
presume
yes
sir
that
he
did
present
himself.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
you
are
correct
your
honor,
yes
sir.
we
will
therefore
try
to
the
deal
is
--
briefly
as
possible
in
the
time
allotted
us,
those
constitutional
questions
which
we
think
may
concern
the
court
in
arriving
at
a
decision.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
understand
the
word
qualifications,
may
it
please
the
court,
to
mean
the
qualifications
imposed
in
the
georgia
constitution
and
also
the
qualification
imposed
by
article
vi,
clause
3
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
the
qualifications
of
the
georgia
constitution,
may
it
please
the
court,
opposed
which
are
usually
contained
in
state
constitutions
saying
that
he'd
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
21
years
of
age,
citizen
of
georgia
for
two
years
and
the
rest
of
that
--
of
the
county
from
which
elected
of
the
district
from
which
elected
for
one
year
and
it
has
other
provisions
in
the
georgia
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
any
in
the
georgia
constitution?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
nothing
except
the
qualification
as
contained
in
the
georgia
constitution
your
honor
that
he'd
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
we
have
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
would
think
that
with
the
qualification
of
article
vi,
clause
3
of
the
federal
constitution,
we
do
have
nominal
qualifications.
of
course
he
can't
owe
money
to
the
state
and
there
are
some
specific
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that's
right,
cannot
be
indebted
to
the
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
is
not
involved
here,
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
court
please,
the
qualifications
contained
in
the
federal
constitution,
article
vi,
clause
3
which
requires
that
a
state
legislator
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
because
of
a
--
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
we
think
to
be
a
paramount
qualifications.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
i
think
that
it'd
be
construction
of
course,
it's
up
to
this
court
to
construe
that
provision
of
the
constitution.
but
i
think
that
that
provision
means
and
is
a
qualification
that
a
person
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
it's
imposed
on
the
congress
upon
the
legislative
and
executive
branch
and
the
judiciary
of
the
several
states
in
article
vi,
clause
3.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
taken
to
forbid
the
expression
of
views.
but
i
think
if
a
person
which
i
will
try
to
develop,
i
think
if
a
challenge
is
unopposed
that
the
legislature
can
hear
it.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
can
hear
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
determining
qualifications.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well
i
don't
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
court
knows
i
can't
state
that
nearly
because
the
legislature
merely
disagreed
with
the
views
of
a
member
who
was
being
seated
that
he
could
not
be
seated.
but
i
think
that
the
legislature
in
a
hearing
to
determine
the
qualifications
under
article
vi,
clause
3
of
the
united
states
constitution
that
a
member
of
a
state
legislature
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
can
hear
any
relevant
evidence
which
bears
on
his
qualifications
to
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir
and
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
because
his
advocating
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
he
is
advocating
an
amendment
of
the
law
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
i
think
the
states
will
also
along
i
think
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
i
think
mr.
bond
can
state
his
views.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
i
speak
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
am
not
trying
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
i
think
he
advocated
violation
of
the
laws.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
mr.
bond
stated
as
set
out
in
the
opinion
that
he
would
advocate
it
that
those
who
violate
--
anyone
violate
the
selective
service
act
for
any
reason
which
they
saw
fit.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
alright
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
record
page
138.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
may
i
read?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
during
a
taped
interview
with
the
representative
of
the
media,
mr.
bond
after
endorsing
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
statement
was
asked
why
he
endorsed
it
and
his
answer
was
as
follows.
why?
endorse
it
--
this,
because
i
like
to
think
of
myself
as
a
pacifist
and
one
who
opposes
that
war
and
any
other
war
and
eager
and
anxious
to
encourage
people
not
to
participate
in
it
for
any
reason
that
they
choose.
and
secondly,
i
agree
with
the
statement
because
of
the
reasons
set
forth
in
it.
because
i
think
it
is
so
hypocritical
for
us
to
maintain
that
we
are
fighting
for
liberty
in
other
places
and
we
are
not
guaranteeing
freedom
to
citizens
inside
the
continental
united
states.
further
reading,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
they
asked
if
he
thought
his
views
were
at
variance
with
the
duties
that
might
be
required
of
him
as
a
representative
in
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
state
of
georgia,
mr.
bond
replied,
"well
i
think
the
fact
that
the
united
states
government
fights
a
war
in
vietnam.
i
don't
think
that
i
as
a
second
class
citizen
of
the
united
states
have
a
requirement
to
support
that
war.
i
think
my
responsibility
is
to
oppose
things
that
i
think
are
wrong,
if
they
are
in
vietnam
or
new
york
or
chicago
or
atlanta
or
whatever".
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
sir?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
could
--
i
am
sorry,
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
--
let
me
explain
to
the
court.
this
entire
statement
--
excuse
me.
the
entire
statement
of
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
was
read
into
the
record
at
the
hearing.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
he
didn't
write
it
but
he
was
--
publicity
and
i
don't
think
he
is
--
i
think
if
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
that
he
was
a
student
--
i
mean
he
was
the
publicity
direct
for
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
at
the
hearing,
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
it
was
read
to
him
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
he
endorsed
it
and
said
he
reaffirmed
his
endorsement
of
it
at
the
hearing.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
they
were
opposed
to
the
national
foreign
policy.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
would
hold
that
was
constitutional,
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
obviously
sir,
i
think
the
same
reason
therewith.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
the
same
reasoning
would
apply
there.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
same
reason,
yes
sir.
it
is
our
position,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
qualifications
imposed
in
the
georgia
constitution,
all
the
member
of
the
georgia
--
by
the
georgia
constitution.
i
want
to
say,
but
there
there's
another
constitution
imposed
by
the
u.s.
constitution
article
vi,
clause
3
which
of
course
we
joined
issue
and
there's
not
being
a
promissory
oath
that
that
is
a
qualification
imposed
by
the
framers
of
our
constitution.
now
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
why?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
qualification
that
an
elected
representative
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think,
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
he
would
be
bound
to
say
it
and
he
would
be,
if
he
--
please
the
court,
that
that
would
be
a
qualification
that
he
possessed
at
that
time
that
he
said.
now,
i
agree
that
this
issue
has
not
been
raised.
i've
learned
a
great
deal
about
the
--
i
think
our
constitution
in
studying
this
facts
in
this
case.
but
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
one
of
the
reasons
this
issue
hasn't
been
raised
is
because
of
the
fact
that
certainly
for
the
past
hundred
years,
we
have
had
orderly
government.
we
have
had
a
government
under
the
constitution
in
this
country.
and
one
of
my
states,
georgia,
was
one
that
participated
in
the
civil
war.
but
it
was
only
when
those
members
of
the
legislature
violated
this
oath.
violated
disqualification
if
you
please
the
court,
that
we
had
chaos
in
the
country,
that
this
is
a
fundamental
point,
a
fundamental
thing
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
wanted,
put
in
to
the
constitution
by
the
members
of
congress,
not
only
congress
but
of
the
state
legislators.
may
i
say
in
the
state
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that's
right
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
that
line
of
questioning
didn't
occur
here.
mr.
bond
--
i
believe
mr.
bond
did
say
that
he
didn't
encourage
others
to
burn
their
draft
card
that
he
had
his
own
draft
card
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
one
of
the
reasons
your
honor.
we
think
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
legislature
in
hearing
the
evidence
in
judging
his
qualifications
found
that
he
would
not
qualify
to
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
he
did
say
that.
that
was
evidence
in
his
favor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
of
course.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
was
for
evidence
for
the
house
to
consider.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
may
i
read
the
provision
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
its
very
short,
article
vi,
clause
3.
the
senators
and
representatives
before
mentioned,
and
the
members
of
the
several
state
legislatures,
and
all
executives
and
judicial
officers,
both
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
several
states,
shall
be
bound
by
oath
or
affirmation,
to
support
this
constitution;
but
no
religious
test
shall
ever
be
required
as
a
qualification,
a
qualification
to
any
office
or
public
trust
under
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
not
in
the
united
states
constitution
sir,
except
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
to
state
my
position
to
that.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
but
we
--
of
course
this
--
he
was
--
one
of
the
allegation,
one
of
the
challenge
unopposed
stated
that
he
was
not
qualified
under
this
provision
of
the
u.s.
constitution
and
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
one
of
the
challenges
to
mr.
bond's
being
seated.
and
the
georgia
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
statement,
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
it
would
be.
but
the
provisions
for
the
house
to
judge
it
--
the
georgia
house
of
course
is
not
in
the
constitution.
that
relates
back
to
the
georgia
constitution,
the
provision
that
the
house
shall
be
that
sole
judge
of
the
qualification
in
election
of
its
members.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
the
provision
of
the
georgia
constitution
itself
which
the
oath
proscribes
in
the
constitution
requires
to
a
person
to
be
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
not
in
those
words
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
so
the
only
thing
that
i
can
assume
--
i
hope
we
understand,
the
legislature
acts
independently.
the
legislature
found
authority
under
the
qualification
provision
of
the
georgia
constitution,
that
they
were
sole
judge
of
the
qualifications
of
a
member
to
that
house.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
as
to
qualifications?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
we
have
no
state
court
decisions
as
construed
in
this
provision
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
statement.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
later
on
in
my
argument
i
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
get
--
touch
on
that
issue
as
to
the
due
process.
so
it
is
our
position
that
the
federal
constitution
provides
a
minimum
qualification,
the
only
qualification
there.
may
i
go
back
one
moment
because
of
course
i
digress
--
you
might
--
the
court
might
say
is,
this
is
a
--
why,
why
does
the
u.s.
constitution,
why
is
that
important?
well,
why
is
a
state
legislature,
why
is
that
important?
we
have
50
states
and
i've
said
in
the
state
legislature
and
why
is
that
an
important
position?
well,
may
i
just
very
briefly
state
that
a
state
legislator
doesn't
just
make
laws
that
affect
the
people
in
his
district.
a
state
legislator
makes
laws
which
affect
the
people
of
the
entire
state
of
which
he
is
a
member
without
the
record
modes
of
transportation
now.
a
state
legislator
makes
laws
which
affect
the
people
of
the
entire
nation.
but
not
only
that
and
to
have
a
constitutional
form
of
government,
there
is
a
single
member
of
a
state
legislature
could
theoretically
be
or
could
theoretically
cares
the
deciding
vote
in
--
as
to
whether
or
not
the
united
states
constitution
itself,
an
amendment
thereto
was
ratified.
so
it
is
an
important
office.
now
when
mr.
bond
--
when
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
issued
this
statement
on
january
the
6th,
mr.
bond
made
his
statements
on
it
and
then
the
legislature
of
the
house
convened
on
january
the
5th.
mr.
bond
was
an
elected
representative
which
we
maintain
with
all
except
the
foul
qualification
that
of
being
bound
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
there
is
a
necessity
for
free
speech
under
the
constitution.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
repeat
that
to
this
court.
it
ensures
the
process
of
orderly
government.
this
court
has
imposed
limitations
on
free
speech,
the
known
line
in
cases
of
obscenity
and
in
the
advocacy
of
law
of
violation.
it
is
our
position
that
mr.
bond
in
adapting
the
statement
of
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
and
in
his
statements
thereon
advocated
violation
of
the
selective
service
act.
and
therefore
his
speech
was
not
protected
but
even
assuming
that
his
speech
was
protected,
we
have
to
remember
mr.
bond's
position,
he
was
not
a
citizen.
he
was
a
--
in
a
position
of
a
public
servant
making
comments
reflecting
upon
his
qualifications,
the
qualifications
imposed
by
the
federal
constitution.
the
georgia
house,
under
the
georgia
constitution
is
the
sole
judge
of
his
qualification.
and
we
think
that
because
mr.
bond
of
his
elective
position,
he
had
a
great
responsibility
and
obligation
than
that
of
an
ordinary
citizen
and
that
was
the
qualification
which
he
was
to
be
bound
to
support
the
united
states
constitution.
and
therefore
we
say,
that
in
this
instance
and
under
these
circumstances,
the
sixth
article,
article
vi
of
the
constitution
is
of
equal
rank
and
dignity
with
the
bill
of
rights
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
and
that
the
legislature
in
acting
as
a
judge
of
his
qualifications
was
authorized
to
treat
article
vi
of
the
federal
constitution
as
controlling
insofar
as
determining
his
qualifications.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i'm
certain
there
has
been
but
i
have
no
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
don't
--
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
possibly
there
has
been.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
in
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
in
the
abstract
if
i
may,
i
certainly
don't
intended
it,
conveyed
of
this
court,
the
impression
that
no
one
can
have
contrary
views.
but
i
have
to
relate
it
back
to
article
vi
of
the
constitution
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
i
will
cover
that
in
--
on
the
next
page
in
just
a
moment
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
in
the
record
that
we
have
your
honor.
we
state
that
the
georgia
house
was
the
judge
of
mr.
bond's
qualification.
it
was
sitting
as
a
sole
tribune
or
judicial
body
who
were
authorized
to
determine
his
qualifications.
we
say
however
that
the
court
should
protect
mr.
bond's
constitutional
rights
but
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
house
in
judging
qualifications.
now
back
to
question
justice
fortas,
this
statement
by
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
of
course
which
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
read
this
to
the
court
because
it's
of
--
about
two
pages
long
and
my
time
is
getting
very
close.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
mr.
bond
was
called
before
the
house
of
committee
and
on
page
of
111
of
the
record,
the
statement
would
be
found
that
mr.
bond
stated
that
he
was
eager
and
anxious
to
encourage
people
not
to
participate
in
the
war
in
vietnam
for
any
reason
that
they
choose.
now,
this
was
evidenced
for
the
house
to
consider
in
judging
mr.
bond's
qualification.
he
also
said
--
the
record
page
41,
"i
do
not
advocate
that
people
should
break
the
law".
that
was
evidenced
in
his
favor
but
it
was
also
evidence
that
the
house
could
consider.
he
said
from
the
record
on
page
112,
"i
don't
think
that
i
as
a
second
class
citizen
of
the
united
states
have
a
requirement
to
support
the
law".
this
also
was
evidenced
that
the
house
could
consider.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
sir,
i
hate
to
answer
you
in
this
manner
but
i
don't
think
it's
important
--
is
to
what
it
means
to
me
as
what
it
could
have
meant
to
the
people
who
were
sitting
as
his
judges
at
that
time
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
--
for
his
qualification.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
sir?
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
wherever
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
there
is
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
would
concede
that,
yes
your
honor.
i
can't
say
to
this
court
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that
i
could
say
that
it's
imposed
in
all
its
citizen's
right
to
support
the
war
in
vietnam.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
i
am.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
don't
say
that
that
statement
taken
in
and
of
itself,
may
it
please
the
court,
would
authorize
it
but
i
think
that
the
legislature
was
a
judge
of
his
qualification.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
he
as
a
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir,
i
agree
with
the
court.
when
the
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
sir
i
think
--
if
i
can
just
summarize.
i
think
that
the
legislature
was
a
judge
of
his
qualification,
a
184
members
in
the
vote
thought
he
wasn't
qualified,
12
members
voted
to
seat
him.
what
the
standard
of
review,
i
think
that
the
lower
court
was
correct
in
stating
a
rational
basis
was
the
standard
of
view
--
of
review.
i
don't
think
we're
concern
with
whether
or
not
another
forum
might
have
judged
bond
differently
but
we
are
concerned
with
the
fact,
was
there
are
any
evidence
upon
which
the
georgia
house
could
form
a
rational
basis
for
finding
him
disqualified
under
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well
your
honor,
we
say
that
the
provision
of
the
constitution
itself
is
a
qualification,
the
federal
constitution.
and
that
the
house,
the
georgia
house
of
representatives
under
the
georgia
constitution
is
a
sole
judge
of
the
qualification
of
its
members
and
if
therefore
the
house
had
a
right
to
judge
of
his
qualification
and
was
the
only
body
that
could
judge
of
his
qualification
as
contained
in
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
we
say
that
that
is
a
qualification,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i'm
not
trying
to
avoid
the
issue
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
now,
if
they
do
it
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
if
they
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
because
they
don't
like
the
way
(inaudible)
your
hair.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
constitutional
and
i
think
this
court
could
so
hold
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
it
would
--
wouldn't
be
--
have
a
due
process,
excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
part
of
it
would
be
possible.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
that
if
he
advocated
that
other
people
violate
the
law
then
it
would
be
possible
to
someone
to
--
and
not
choose
and
oppose
the
challenge
to
his
qualifications.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
after
the
legislature
heard
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
no
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
still
(inaudible)
from
the
governor's
brief
that
it
is
a
fact.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
this
court
in
such
an
instance
as
that
--
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
could
take
jurisdiction,
yes
under
such
instances
as
that.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well
sir
as
i
understand
the
law
would
be
determined
as
to
whether
or
not
a
person's
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir,
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes,
i
think
so.
if
i
may
just
summarize
briefly.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
we
say
that
the
qualification
imposed
in
the
constitution
was
judged
by
the
georgia
house.
we
don't
think
mr.
bond's
rights
under
the
first
amendment
were
violated
because
we
think
that
the
speech
--
parts
of
the
speech
which
he
made
could
be
reasonably
interpreted
as
advocating
violation
of
the
selective
service
act.
but
even
if
he
--
it'd
be
determined
to
the
speech
of
mr.
bond
would
have
been
protected
as
an
ordinary
citizen,
the
qualification
imposed
by
the
united
states
constitution
has
equaled
dignity
with
the
first
amendment
and
is
not
controlling
and
the
house
was
authorized
to
determine
his
qualification.
we
think
that
mr.
bond
was
afforded
due
process.
his
constitutional
rights
were
protected
as
there
was
some
evidence
upon
which
the
georgia
house
could
make
its
determination
of
his
qualification.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
well,
it's
our
contention
your
honor
that
when
he
said
i
--
urged
citizens
to
--
excuse
me,
i
have
a
reference
to
it
right
here
to
--
he
was
eager
and
anxious
--
the
record
page
on
111.
eager
and
anxious
--
was
he
--
eager
and
anxious
to
encourage
people
not
to
participate
in
it,
the
war,
for
any
reason
that
they
choose.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
k.
bolton
yes,
we
would
on
that,
yes
sir.
