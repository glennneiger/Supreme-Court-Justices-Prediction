mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
i
see
--
as
i
think
your
honors
conceive
from
the
development
by
mr.
moore
is
whether
a
state
legislative
body's
refusal
to
sit
an
elected
representative
whether
refusal
is
based
upon
his
public
expressions
of
opinion
on
national
issues,
whether
such
a
refusal
violates
the
freedom
of
speech
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth,
whether
it
deprives
him
since
it
is
a
national
issue
that
was
under
discussion
of
a
privilege
in
immunity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
whether
it
unconstitutionally
deprive
those
who
elected
mr.
bond
of
their
right
of
franchise
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
possibly
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
the
court
below
recognized
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
issue
of
freedom
of
speech
involved
here,
as
it
indicated
at
page
142
of
the
records.
but
it
held
that
an
elected
rep
--
legislator
had
less
right
than
an
individual
citizen
to
express
his
views
on
public
issues.
as
the
court
said,
mr.
bond's
right
to
speak
and
to
dissent
as
a
private
citizen
is
subject
to
the
limitation
that
he
sought
to
assume
membership
in
the
house
record
151.
and
the
court
was
--
of
the
view
that
since
it
said,
the
statement
of
sncc
was
against
national
policy.
i
think
the
first
time
a
court
has
ever
made
such
a
determination,
at
least
the
federal
court
in
these
days
that
it
was
mr.
bond's
duty
to
remain
silent
or
forfeit
his
position.
now
that
based
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
supposed
the
statement
can
be
said
to
be
contrary
to
what
the
government
position
is
in
the
particular
matter.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
whether
national
policy
had
any
real
significance
as
a
criterion
of
course
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
is
quite
right.
now,
the
difficulty
with
the
court's
reasoning
in
holding
that
a
legislator
elect
has
less
right
to
express
himself
on
public
issues,
is
that
it
assumed
the
voice
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
said
in
lemont
and
in
martin
against
travis
and
a
number
lot
of
cases
that
it
is
solely
for
the
of
the
speaker
that
the
first
amendment
was
written
and
is
to
be
enforced.
on
the
contrary,
there
is
at
least
a
greater
right
in
the
public
to
hear
the
speaker.
and
so
the
status
of
the
speaker
should
not
derogate
from
the
right
of
the
public
to
hear
his
statement.
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court
explicitly
in
wood
against
georgia
in
a
quotation
which
is
set
forth
at
page
30
of
our
brief
held
that
an
elected
sheriff
had
a
right
to
issue
a
press
relief
challenging
a
charge
to
a
grand
jury.
and
the
court
said
that
the
petitioner
was
an
elected
official
and
had
the
right
to
enter
the
field
of
political
controversy.
the
role
that
elected
official
playing
our
society
and
he
makes
it
all
the
more
imperative,
that
they'd
be
allowed
freely
to
express
themselves
on
matters
of
current
public
importance.
but
our
position
here
is
not
nearly
that
there
was
a
right
on
the
part
of
mr.
bond
to
make
the
statement,
that
he
had
a
duty
to
express
himself
if
those
were
his
views
on
these
public
issues
or
at
least
three
interrelated
reasons.
the
first
is
that,
as
a
presumed
leader,
we
now
see
he's
been
elected
three
times,
leader
of
his
people
in
the
136th
district.
he
has
the
right
to
exercise
his
influence
upon
them
to
attempt
to
persuade
them
to
his
point
of
view.
the
second
is,
it
can
be
presumed,
i
think
fairly,
that
he
states
it
for
a
substantial
number
of
them,
they
having
elected
him
several
times
in
the
course
of
this
controversy
and
he
as
their
spokesman
and
if
that
is
their
view,
why
cannot
it
be
expressed
through
him.
and
the
third
reason,
is
the
reason
suggested
by
this
court's
statement
in
garrison
against
louisiana
and
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
namely
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
anything
that
affects
the
qualifications
of
the
individual
whom
they
have
elected.
and
what
could
be
a
better
way
of
assessing
the
qualifications
of
the
man
but
in
having
him
express
his
views
in
this
way.
the
position
of
the
court
below
giving
a
lesser
right,
a
lesser
duty
to
the
individual
because
if
he
is
elected
undercuts
all
of
these
principles.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
would
say
that
as
a
matter
of
principle,
subject
to
of
course
prosecution
for
a
crime
with
the
usual
elements
of
due
process
in
criminal
cases
that
the
georgia
legislature
could
not
exclude
mr.
bond
or
any
other
person.
and
that
needless
to
say
on
this
relatively
pure
record,
no
such
problem
was
even
touched
on
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
despite
the
--
its
not
necessary
but
our
position
here
which
--
is
that
there
is
an
absolute
right
on
the
part
of
the
legislator
elect
to
say
anything
he
wishes
and
not
to
be
disqualified,
subject
of
course
to
criminal
prosecution
and
as
--
and
if
they're
appropriate
to
a
libel
suit
assuming
that
the
court
were
--
were
to
hold
that
libel
suit
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment
as
it
has.
our
view
is
that
the
reason
for
this
absolute
right
to
take
office,
subject
to
the
qualifications
set
forth
specifically
in
disqualifications
in
the
georgia
constitution,
a
constitution
promulgated
by
the
people
of
georgia
or
their
predecessors
of
course,
is
that
there
is
not
only
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
involved
here
but
the
freedom
of
the
franchise.
and
the
--
and
they'd
be
just
as
appropriate
for
me
to
--
well
perhaps
i
ought
to
discuss
the
--
the
freedom
of
a
franchise
a
little
later.
no,
i
will
develop
it
at
this
point
the
--
if
your
honor
pleases
since
we've
reached
that
point
and
come
back
to
the
first
amendment
and
the
arguments
of
the
court
a
little
later.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
freedom
of
the
franchise
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
has
so
far
having
developed
only
into
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
the
constitution
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
say
however
that
it
is
inherent
in
represented
democracy
that
the
will
of
the
people
should
be
reflected
in
the
election
of
their
people
and
that
anything
that
would
have
obstruct
that
would
be
inconsistent
by
our
entire
system
of
represented
democracy
as
set
forth
by
the
court
in
the
recent
cases
of
reynolds
against
sims,
etcetera.
now
the
court
has
adopted
the
instrument,
an
appropriate
one
of
the
equal
protection
clause
as
the
key
but
it
seems
inherent
in
our
democratic
system
that
the
will
of
the
people
should
not
be
prevented
by
an
existing
legislative
majority
which
very
often
has
been
elected
at
the
same
time
as
the
man
whose
case
is
in
issue.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
think
that
there
is
a
sufficient
standard
in
what
this
court
has
said
under
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
reynolds
against
sims
case
and
in
the
other
cases.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
is
enough.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right
and
in
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
except
that
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
used
by
this
court
specifically
and
repeatedly
in
recent
days
as
the
means
of
guaranteeing
freedom
of
the
franchise.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
i
can't
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
true
that
there
is
an
explicit
statement
in
the
constitution
with
respect
to
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
a
difference
but
i
think
the
equal
protection
clause
also
guarantee
although
it
doesn't
say
so,
freedom
of
the
franchise
and
to
eliminate
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
free
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
they
could
provide
--
i
think
the
equal
protection
clause
provides
that
a
particular
group
of
people
in
a
district
or
a
section
of
the
state
cannot
be
deprived
in
having
their
votes
counted.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
when
they
vote,
right.
and
in
that
case
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
equal
protection
and
that's
what
we
are
relying
upon
here.
now,
the
system
of
which
was
applied
here
of
denying
the
right
--
the
right
of
an
elected
representative
to
take
office
on
the
basis
of
qualification
enunciated
by
the
legislative
body
at
the
time
the
demand
appeared
to
take
office,
is
of
course
inconsistent
with
our
entire
history
or
federal
history
and
of
our
state
history.
and
when
the
issue
was
raised
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention,
the
federal
constitution
convention,
and
it
was
proposed
to
allow
a
legislature
to
determine
the
conditions
of
taking
office.
it
will
be
recalled
that
people
with
such
diverse
views
as
madison
and
hamilton
agreed
that
the
legislative
body
was
not
the
body
to
impose
the
qualifications,
contrary
to
what
the
constitution
itself
should
have
provided.
and
this
was
of
course
inherent
in
the
historic
struggle
in
england
which
madison
made
reference
and
refer
of
course
to
the
--
i
refer
of
course
to
the
wilkes
case.
and
that
to
the
attempt
by
a
--
the
english
parliament
to
present
mr.
wilkes
reelected
and
elected
several
times
from
taking
office.
if
i
may
return
for
the
moment
to
the
issue
of
the
freedom
of
speech
and
then
return
here,
let
me
indicate
that
the
court
below,
in
addition
to
adopting
a
standard
of
giving
less
protection
to
the
legislator
elect
in
the
freedom
of
speech
area,
adopted
a
self-imposed
system
of
restricted
judicial
review.
what
the
court
said
was
that
because
of
the
separation
of
power's
principle
and
the
principle
of
federalism,
it
would
not
protect
the
first
amendment
rights
in
this
case,
the
way
it
would
in
an
ordinary
case.
and
instead
it
would
apply
what
it
called
a
rational
evidentiary
rule
that
is
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
rational
basis
for
the
legislative
impairment
of
first
amendment
rights
in
this
case.
now
aside
from
the
fact
that
of
course,
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
have
repeatedly
--
despite
the
doctrine
as
a
federalism
and
a
separation
of
powers,
federal
courts
have
moved
into
the
protection
of
rights
against
state
body
and
courts
of
course,
by
virtue
of
their
inherent
function
have
protected
rights
even
though
the
rights
was
sought
to
be
taken
away
by
legislative
groups
or
by
the
executive
or
by
commissions.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
of
course.
i
agree
on
that.
now,
the
reason
why
the
courts
--
what
the
court
did
below
was
improper
in
our
view
was
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
first
amendment.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
regulation
of
property
under
the
due
process
clause.
and
i
think
what
was
said
in
west
virginia
against
barnette
and
in
succeeding
cases
indicates
a
distinction
between
the
standards
to
be
applied,
a
regulation
of
property
and
impairment
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
because
this
court
has
said
that
in
the
area
of
the
regulation
of
property,
the
standard
--
to
protect
the
standard
for
the
individual
will
not
be
as
great
as
where
the
first
amendment
right
is
involved?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
west
virginia
against
barnette.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
guess
i
have
misstated
it.
the
court
has
really
said
that
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
property
right
involved.
well,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
your
honor
that
the
court
said
that
where
property
is
involved,
the
test
of
protection
will
not
be
as
great.
the
amount
of
protection,
it
will
not
be
great
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
because
the
constitution
as
an
explicit
first
amendment
provision
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct,
that's
what
i
meant.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
has
to
be
more
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
which
explicitly.
that
is
quite
through.
now,
none
of
the
--
none
of
the
test
ever
used
by
this
court,
whether
it
was
the
clear
and
present
danger
of
schenck
or
whether
it
was
the
modification
of
chief
judge
hand
in
the
dennis
case,
adopts
it
by
a
majority
of
this
court
or
whether
if
the
sherbert
against
verner
case
of
a
compelling
state
interest.
none
of
these
tests
ever
moved
down
to
the
test
used
by
the
court
below
namely,
is
there
a
rational
basis
for
what
was
done.
the
court
below
in
using
this
rational
basis
test
drew
it
out
of
two
cases
that
has
no
possible
bearing
on
the
issues
here.
those
cases
were
the
thompson
against
louisville
and
garner
against
louisiana
where
--
what
the
court
did
here
--
there
was
to
reverse
convictions
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
semblance,
no
iota
of
evidence
to
support
the
convictions
under
the
due
process
clause.
and
of
course
that
has
--
it
cannot
be
applied
here
because
i
think
that
not
even
the
appellees
would
urge
that
if
there
was
an
iota
of
evidence
to
justify
the
impairment
of
first
amendment
rights
that
this
court
could
sustain
the
court
below.
now
the
appellees
rely
upon
a
decent
kind
of
rational
evidence
--
evidentiary
test.
they
referred
to
the
cases
of
konigsberg
and
schare
cases
involving
application
through
admission
to
the
bar.
and
it
is
--
those
are
the
cases
which
--
in
which
this
court
sustaining
applicants
for
members
of
the
bar,
i'm
talking
about
the
first
(inaudible)
case.
now,
as
held
that
upon
an
examination
of
the
whole
record
of
that
record,
does
not
show
a
rational
basis
for
the
denial
of
membership
with
the
bar
that
the
court
will
not
sustain
the
denial
by
the
character
committee
involved.
but
of
course,
there
is
a
very
real
distinction
between
an
application
for
admission
to
the
bar
on
the
basis
of
good
character
to
be
determined
by
a
character
committee
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
person
who
is
elected
by
the
people
of
his
district
is
to
be
--
is
to
take
his
seat.
whatever
may
be
the
test,
i'm
not
rearguing
now
the
test
that
was
used
in
schware
and
konigsberg.
so
i
would
argue
with
an
absolute
right,
despite
political
views
or
opinions.
whatever
may
be
the
test
in
the
bar
cases,
that
test
certainly
can't
be
applied
where
you
not
only
have
the
question
of
freedom
of
speech.
but
you
have
the
question
of
giving
voice
to
the
electoral
vote
of
the
people
here.
our
view
i
believe
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
have
them
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
have
not
argued
that
in
our
brief
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
frequent
statements
by
the
court
on
that
subject,
and
because
we
don't
think
it
necessary
to
press
the
issue.
we
think
that
we
have
enough
here
in
terms
of
both
the
first
amendment
and
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
i'm
not
briefed
with
that.
now
even
if
we
take
any
test
other
than
the
absolute
test
which
we
have
suggested
if
necessary
in
order
to
vindicate
not
only
the
first
amendment
rights
but
the
equal
protection
clause
here.
we
think
on
this
record,
the
court
below
acted
unreasonably
and
arbitrarily
and
that
there
is
nothing
to
sustain
the
view
that
the
statements
made
my
mr.
bond
are
inconsistent
with
his
constitutional
duty
or
show
that
he
would
not
care
--
he
would
not
execute
his
oaths
of
office.
i
come
shortly
to
the
question
of
what
the
oath
of
office
actually
means.
because
as
mr.
moore
has
indicated,
the
statements
that
were
made
here
by
mr.
bond,
although
we
would
argue
that
they
would
be
protected
if
they
were
in
the
form
of
a
speech,
of
a
leaflet,
of
an
argument
in
the
marketplace,
were
actually
as
indicated
a
response
to
an
inquiry
made
by
a
reporter.
whatever
the
cases
might
suggest
and
we
have
seen
none
that
are
against
us
on
this
on
the
subject
of
incitement,
on
the
subject
of
attempting
to
instigate
overreaction,
none
of
that
happens
to
be
in
this
case.
as
i
say,
i
would
argue
that
mr.
bond's
right
to
go
into
the
seat
make
the
same
statement
was
absolutely
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
but
here,
we
do
not
have
any
of
that.
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
said
fairly
that
in
this
record,
the
remarks
made
by
mr.
bond
support
an
argument
that
a
compelling
state
interest
justifies
this
infringement
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
now
tending
for
the
moment
for
the
question
of
the
georgia
constitution
and
the
oath
of
office,
the
court
below
recognized
that
there
was
no
qualification
set
forth
in
the
georgia
constitution
which
was
not
met
by
mr.
bond,
and
that
he
was
disqualified
under
any
of
the
specific
provision.
what
it
said
however
was
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
--
the
belief
by
the
legislative
body
that
mr.
bond
could
not
conscientiously
take
the
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
georgia.
an
oath
which
is
set
forth
at
page
47
of
our
brief
and
which
provides
in
the
following
language,
i
will
support
the
constitution
of
this
state
and
of
the
united
states
and
on
all
questions
and
measures
which
may
come
before
me,
i
will
so
conduct
myself
as
well
in
my
judgment
the
most
conducive
to
the
interest
and
prosperity
of
the
state.
this
said
to
legislature,
mr.
bond
was
not
able
to
take
because
of
the
public
expressions
of
opinions
that
he
had
made.
and
of
course
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
that
is
a
very
real
distinction.
i
think
that
there's
no
question
but
that
he
had
to
take
the
oath
if
he
wanted
to
take
office.
this
oath
is
a
--
first
of
all,
the
oath
itself
or
at
least
part
of
it
is
required
by
article
vi,
clause
3
of
the
federal
constitution
which
require
state
legislators
to
take
the
oath
to
support
the
federal
constitution.
the
oath
--
and
that
is
really
our
point
here
mr.
justice
harlan
is
a
mode
of
taking
office
not
a
standard
by
which
the
judge,
the
fitness
of
the
man
to
take
office.
it
is
like
all
of
these
oaths
of
taking
office,
a
promissory
oath,
a
solemnification
of
the
important
step
of
taking
office.
and
it
is
not
to
minimize
it
in
the
slightest
to
say
that
it
is
not
intended
as
a
method
of
refusing
to
let
people
take
the
oath,
which
was
done
in
the
present
case.
there
is
a
new
jersey
superior
court
decision
which
i
may
--
will
ask
the
court
to
leave
--
to
cite
since
i
have
not
put
it
in
my
brief
but
told
our
opponents
about
imbrie
against
marsh
in
which
judge
bigelow
discussed
this
particular
problem
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
imbrie,
i-m-b-r-i-e
your
honor
against
marsh.
judge
bigelow
in
5
new
jersey
superior
239
said,
"it
is
a
promise
and
assurance
of
future
conduct.
it
is
not
a
device
for
making
some
persons
ineligible
for
office."
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
will
agree
that
this
is
a
step
which
must
be
taken
by
everyone
who
wants
to
take
office
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
say
that
it's
such
an
extreme
case
even
in
such
an
extreme
case.
there
is
no
question.
i
shouldn't
put
it
that
way.
that
is
my
opinion
that
that
he
would
be
permitted
to
take
the
oath
of
office.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
once
you
move
away
from
the
function
of
the
oath
namely,
that
it's
merely
the
preliminary
step
to
taking
--
carrying
out
your
official
function
and
turn
it
into
something
which
could
be
examined
in
the
point
of
view
of
determining
whether
the
man
can
consciously
or
properly
or
means
to
take
the
oath,
then
you
move
into
an
unlimited
area
which
is
exactly
the
area
that
we
rendered
to
here.
an
examination
of
his
background
of
the
statements
of
what
he
had
intended.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
not
critical
to
my
case,
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
even
if
i
said
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
even
if
he's
--
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
he
said
i
will
take
the
oath
and
renounce
it
or
take
the
oath
and
not
mean
it
to
--
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
take
the
oath
and
he
would
have
a
right
to
take
office.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
we
are
still
met
here
with
the
basic
issue
whether
the
legislative
body
to
action
is
valid.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right.
and
we
would
also
be
left
--
i
would
also
have
in
reserve
so
far
as
this
oath
is
concerned,
the
whole
question
of
whether
it's
not
unconstitutionally
vague
under
the
decision
in
baggett
against
bullitt
and
under
the
decision
in
cramp
against
florida.
because
this
oath
viewed
now
as
the
--
as
was
done
below
as
a
standard
of
behavior
does
raise
a
question
of
vagueness
and
does
involve
the
same
first
amendment
problem
that
led
the
court
in
bagett
against
bullitt
and
cramp
against
florida
and
several
others
which
was
the
greatest
division
of
the
court.
they
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
oath
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
case
would
be
exactly
the
same
and
of
course,
exactly
the
case
that
we
have
here.
since
the
georgia
legislature
and
its
members
as
we
note
from
the
amicus
curie
briefs
which
have
developed
this
in
detail
consists
of
members
who
have
repeatedly
and
officially
as
legislators,
taken
the
position
that
the
decisions
of
the
court
protective
of
civil
liberties
that
the
decisions
of
the
courts
in
the
field
of
civil
rights
are
not
to
be
obeyed.
and
i
would
say
that
the
--
all
of
those
people
when
the
georgia
legislature
have
taken
these
positions
violative
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
american
citizens
have
a
right
to
take
their
position
and
cannot
be
precluded
even
though
if
one
were
to
adopt
the
standard
we
have
just
discussed,
one
could
say,
"none
of
them
could
conscientiously
take
this
oath
of
office".
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
exactly
our
of
point.
and
we
are
in
our
right
are
no
different
in
this
respect
than
those
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
as
to
what
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
as
to
what
the
oath
of
office
means.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
true
your
honor.
of
course,
the
members
of
the
georgia
legislature
have
gone
further,
they
have
taken
actions.
the
georgia
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
have
taken
actions
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
and
we
have
--
mr.
bond
has
taken
no
actions.
mr.
bond
stated
his
opinion,
and
yet
i
would
even
say
as
to
the
georgia
legislators
who
took
the
various
actions
depriving
the
citizens
of
georgia,
perceivably
the
negro
citizens
of
their
constitutional
rights.
that
even
those
actions
could
not
be
the
basis
for
depriving
them
of
the
right
to
sit
in
the
legislature
or
to
sit
in
the
government's
chair
of
georgia.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
say
that
the
fact
that
a
man
who
may
be
a
governor
elect
has
taken
a
position
against
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
or
has
taken
even
action
to
deprive
them
of
that
constitutional
rights,
cannot
deprive
him
of
the
right
to
sit.
our
situation
is
a
much
simpler
here
--
matter
here.
we
have
done
nothing
except
to
speak,
and
speak
and
response
to
a
question
that
was
questioned.
but
i
am
--
as
i
say,
i
think
this
constitutional
provision
cannot
be
used
even
as
addressed
to
the
conduct
because
it
is
a
promissory
oath.
looking
to
the
future
is
as
i
suggested
before
and
as
judge
bigelow
indicated,
it
is
a
solemnification
of
the
step
of
taking
office.
it
is
not
something
by
which
we
are
to
judge
the
conduct
and
certainly
not
something
by
which
we
are
to
judge
the
speech.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly
the
same
result
would
follow,
that
it
would
be
improper.
that
congress
cannot
use
an
oath
of
office
as
a
mean
for
excluding
people,
deprive
them
of
the
right
to
sit
because
of
what
they
have
said.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
our
basic
position
and
that
was
why
i
said
at
the
beginning,
i
thought
that
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it's
contrary
to
the
first
amendment,
the
constitution.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
exactly
our
position.
so
we
think
in
this
case
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
all
for
statements
made
subsequent
to
oath.i
think
the
problems
after
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now
with
respect
to
action
taken
after
a
man
is
sitting
in
the
house,
action,
there
i
think
we
may
have
a
different
problem
and
it
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
it
would
constitute
disorderly
behavior
or
misconduct
within
the
meaning
of
those
clauses
relating
to
the
expulsion.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
after
election,
after
being
seated
--
i
didn't
quite
follow
whetner
that
was
the
condition.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
the
--
if
we
are
in
the
context
of
the
present
problem,
we're
talking
about
speech.
then
whether
the
speech
is
before
or
after
would
make
no
difference,
it
would
be
constitutionally
protected.
i
didn't
know
whether
your
honor
was
referring
to
action
taken
afterwards.
if
action
were
taken
afterwards
then
we
would
present
it
with
a
very
different
problem,
the
problem
presented
by
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
house
has
the
power
of
expulsion
which
poses
completely
a
different
historical
problems
i
think
and
also
questions
of
what
misconduct
means.
but
we
are
--we
avoid
that
problem,
we
don't
have
that
before
us
because
we
have
only
the
problem
of
conduct
of
speech
antecedent
to
taking
office.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
had
suggested
before
in
my
argument
that
i
thought
that
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
--
or
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
law,
equal
protection
of
the
laws
provision
to
deny
the
will
of
the
electorate
by
rejecting
somebody
who
has
been
offered
--
who
has
been
elected
by
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
does
create
a
problem
and
a
problem
which
i
think
i
can
avoid
by
indicating
that
i
agree
that
the
triggering
factor
here
and
the
admitted
factor,
there's
no
dispute
as
to
this
is
the
statement
of
mr.
bond,
the
public
expression
of
opinion.
i
think
that
is
the
trigger.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
gives
the
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
as
your
honor
will
see
from
our
brief,
we
are
also
of
the
opinion
that
the
bill
of
attainder
provision
is
applicable
here.
and
that
it
does
trigger
the
right
of
the
court
to
intervene.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now
as
to
due
process
it
would
depend
--
as
to
due
process
i
have
more
doubt.
i
think
that
it
is
the
--
sorry
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
precisely
because
of
the
special
position
which
has
been
recognized
the
first
amendment
possesses,
relationship
to
what
the
court
has
said,
"the
vitality
of
our
institution".
because
it
is
an
explicit
provision
of
the
constitution
and
because
it
is
then
given
--
put
it
one
way
or
the
other,
this
preferred
status
that
the
first
amendment
will
always
be
able
to
trigger
the
protective
use
of
the
judicial
arm.
i
should
like
to
add
mr.
justice
fortas
that
of
course,
bearing
in
mind
the
fact
that
we
also
have
speech
of
the
particular
kind
relating
to
national
issue,
we
are
also
relying
upon
the
fact
that
upon
the
specific
immunities
and
privileges
clause
requiring
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
court
of
course
in
baker
against
carr
was
able
clearly
to
distinguish
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
luther
against
borden
involving
the
republican
form
of
government
and
held
that
where
specific
rights
were
being
denied.
in
fact
that
it
might
also
involve
a
derogation
of
the
republican
form
of
government
and
trusted
to
the
political
arm
did
not
mean
that
the
court
would
indicate
the
rights
involved
there.
and
so
here
we
think
where
we
have
a
first
amendment
right
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
court's
historic
power
to
bend
the
case.
i
--
but
know
whether
you
had
a
question,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
--
i
can
answer
you,
i
think
that
its
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
as
far
as
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
so
far
as
this
court
is
concern,
we
are
not
arguing
that
that
was
the
fact.
we
are
relying
upon
the
first
amendment
issues
here.
i
think
that
--
i
will
not
argue
the
bill
of
attainder
issue
but
merely
indicate
to
the
court
that
i
think
that
under
the
levitz-watson
dodd
case.
this
is
clearly
a
bill
of
attainder
because
one
looks
at
the
charges
that
were
made
against
mr.
bond
at
the
kinds
of
questions
that
were
put
together.
at
the
results
that
follow,
it
is
clearly
a
legislative
determination
of
guilt
of
this
loyalty
of
something
approaching
sedition
of
something
approaching
oppositions
to
the
national
interest
which
in
the
light
of
what
has
occurred
up
to
now
is
clearly
a
permanent.
it
would
make
no
difference
or
would
temperate
permanent
proscription
from
office.
this
is
a
very
different
question
from
the
question
of
judging
the
qualifications.
that
is
determining
whether
a
man
linked
standard
specifically
set
forth
in
the
constitution
at
which
the
quasi
judicial
function
familiar
to
the
court.
here
we
have
a
legislative
determination
where
there
is
no
standard
set
forth
in
the
legislation
or
constitution.
a
trial,
and
no
one
who
raise
his
extended
record
and
sees
the
cross
examination
of
mr.
bond
by
his
judges
can
doubt
that
he
went
through
a
real
trial
as
to
its
political
opinions
and
views
and
that
he
was
found
guilty
and
declared
not
once
but
three
--
that
twice
ineligible
to
serve
in
a
legislature.

mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
i
think
not.
i
think
the
issue
is
--
the
continuing
efforts
of
the
legislature
which
we
can
anticipate
are
going
to
be
unchanged
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
don't,
but
we
know
that
they
have
taken
--
that
they
have
announced
that
he
is
ineligible
for
office,
that
is,
they
originally
announced
that
they
reiterated
the
second
time.
because
when
mr.
bond
was
elected
a
second
time,
the
rule
--
the
committee
of
the
legislature
held
a
hearing
in
which
in
essence
they
said
to
him,
will
you
recant?
and
he
said
no,
i
stand
on
the
same
position
and
they
said,
"ineligible".
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
there
is
in
this
case
also
a
stipulation
providing
in
the
event
a
judgment
will
be
rendered
in
favor
of
mr.
bond
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
salary
which
was
specified.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
on
january
11,
i
think
--
on
january
11
of
this
coming
year,
the
new
legislature
to
which
he
has
been
elected
will
set
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
that
problem
is
really
a
different
one.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it's
a
different
one
because
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
handle
its
own
proceedings
and
to
be
sure
that
somebody
doesn't
interfere
with
them
or
the
--
doesn't
engage
in
misconduct
in
the
course
of
those
proceedings.
now
i
recognize
--
and
this
is
--
and
the
protection
of
that
right
is
indicated
by
of
course
the
two-third
vote
which
is
historically
applicable
to
that
kind
of
situation.
i
turn

mr.

two-third

required
to
expel.
i
do
not
however
concede
that
if
the
legislature
attempted
to
expel
one
for
public
statement
of
his
opinions,
whether
it
was
on
state
issues
or
via
on
federal
issues
that
that
could
--
the
expulsion
could
be
sustained
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
should
say
your
honor
first
that
and
i
will
--
that
in
--
all
--
the
cases
your
honor
has
mentioned
--
i'm
sorry,
well,
affinitive
with
the
--
with
some
of
those
cases
it
was
far
more
than
speech
involved.
there
were
actions
taken
by
late
senator
mccarthy,
subject
to
the
senate
propagation.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
i
would
also
question
except
under
the
broadest
construction
to
bring
(inaudible)
on
the
floor
a
violation
of
the
rules
of
the
legislative
body
to
be
an
active
association.
but
i
would
say
that
those
are
hard
of
cases
and
the
--
i
don't
want
to
try
to
solve
or
to
attempt
to
solve
a
harder
case
involving
a
question
whether
what
one
is
doing
is
that
expression
of
speech
or
as
of
conduct.
i
think
we
have
a
so
much
simpler
case
here
of
pure
speech,
and
i
think
pure
speech
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
pure
expression
of
opinion
which
cannot
conceivably
prevent
the
problem
which
might
be
presented
by
these
harder
cases.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
the
preparing
with
the
proceedings
of
a
legislative
body
and
speaking
to
a
--
giving
freedom
of
expression
to
his
views
in
talking
to
a
newspaper
recorder.
if
i
may
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you.
mr.
moore
will
do
the
rebuttal
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
i
see
--
as
i
think
your
honors
conceive
from
the
development
by
mr.
moore
is
whether
a
state
legislative
body's
refusal
to
sit
an
elected
representative
whether
refusal
is
based
upon
his
public
expressions
of
opinion
on
national
issues,
whether
such
a
refusal
violates
the
freedom
of
speech
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth,
whether
it
deprives
him
since
it
is
a
national
issue
that
was
under
discussion
of
a
privilege
in
immunity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
whether
it
unconstitutionally
deprive
those
who
elected
mr.
bond
of
their
right
of
franchise
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
possibly
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
the
court
below
recognized
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
issue
of
freedom
of
speech
involved
here,
as
it
indicated
at
page
142
of
the
records.
but
it
held
that
an
elected
rep
--
legislator
had
less
right
than
an
individual
citizen
to
express
his
views
on
public
issues.
as
the
court
said,
mr.
bond's
right
to
speak
and
to
dissent
as
a
private
citizen
is
subject
to
the
limitation
that
he
sought
to
assume
membership
in
the
house
record
151.
and
the
court
was
--
of
the
view
that
since
it
said,
the
statement
of
sncc
was
against
national
policy.
i
think
the
first
time
a
court
has
ever
made
such
a
determination,
at
least
the
federal
court
in
these
days
that
it
was
mr.
bond's
duty
to
remain
silent
or
forfeit
his
position.
now
that
based
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
supposed
the
statement
can
be
said
to
be
contrary
to
what
the
government
position
is
in
the
particular
matter.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
whether
national
policy
had
any
real
significance
as
a
criterion
of
course
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
is
quite
right.
now,
the
difficulty
with
the
court's
reasoning
in
holding
that
a
legislator
elect
has
less
right
to
express
himself
on
public
issues,
is
that
it
assumed
the
voice
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
said
in
lemont
and
in
martin
against
travis
and
a
number
lot
of
cases
that
it
is
solely
for
the
of
the
speaker
that
the
first
amendment
was
written
and
is
to
be
enforced.
on
the
contrary,
there
is
at
least
a
greater
right
in
the
public
to
hear
the
speaker.
and
so
the
status
of
the
speaker
should
not
derogate
from
the
right
of
the
public
to
hear
his
statement.
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court
explicitly
in
wood
against
georgia
in
a
quotation
which
is
set
forth
at
page
30
of
our
brief
held
that
an
elected
sheriff
had
a
right
to
issue
a
press
relief
challenging
a
charge
to
a
grand
jury.
and
the
court
said
that
the
petitioner
was
an
elected
official
and
had
the
right
to
enter
the
field
of
political
controversy.
the
role
that
elected
official
playing
our
society
and
he
makes
it
all
the
more
imperative,
that
they'd
be
allowed
freely
to
express
themselves
on
matters
of
current
public
importance.
but
our
position
here
is
not
nearly
that
there
was
a
right
on
the
part
of
mr.
bond
to
make
the
statement,
that
he
had
a
duty
to
express
himself
if
those
were
his
views
on
these
public
issues
or
at
least
three
interrelated
reasons.
the
first
is
that,
as
a
presumed
leader,
we
now
see
he's
been
elected
three
times,
leader
of
his
people
in
the
136th
district.
he
has
the
right
to
exercise
his
influence
upon
them
to
attempt
to
persuade
them
to
his
point
of
view.
the
second
is,
it
can
be
presumed,
i
think
fairly,
that
he
states
it
for
a
substantial
number
of
them,
they
having
elected
him
several
times
in
the
course
of
this
controversy
and
he
as
their
spokesman
and
if
that
is
their
view,
why
cannot
it
be
expressed
through
him.
and
the
third
reason,
is
the
reason
suggested
by
this
court's
statement
in
garrison
against
louisiana
and
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
namely
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
anything
that
affects
the
qualifications
of
the
individual
whom
they
have
elected.
and
what
could
be
a
better
way
of
assessing
the
qualifications
of
the
man
but
in
having
him
express
his
views
in
this
way.
the
position
of
the
court
below
giving
a
lesser
right,
a
lesser
duty
to
the
individual
because
if
he
is
elected
undercuts
all
of
these
principles.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
would
say
that
as
a
matter
of
principle,
subject
to
of
course
prosecution
for
a
crime
with
the
usual
elements
of
due
process
in
criminal
cases
that
the
georgia
legislature
could
not
exclude
mr.
bond
or
any
other
person.
and
that
needless
to
say
on
this
relatively
pure
record,
no
such
problem
was
even
touched
on
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
despite
the
--
its
not
necessary
but
our
position
here
which
--
is
that
there
is
an
absolute
right
on
the
part
of
the
legislator
elect
to
say
anything
he
wishes
and
not
to
be
disqualified,
subject
of
course
to
criminal
prosecution
and
as
--
and
if
they're
appropriate
to
a
libel
suit
assuming
that
the
court
were
--
were
to
hold
that
libel
suit
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment
as
it
has.
our
view
is
that
the
reason
for
this
absolute
right
to
take
office,
subject
to
the
qualifications
set
forth
specifically
in
disqualifications
in
the
georgia
constitution,
a
constitution
promulgated
by
the
people
of
georgia
or
their
predecessors
of
course,
is
that
there
is
not
only
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
involved
here
but
the
freedom
of
the
franchise.
and
the
--
and
they'd
be
just
as
appropriate
for
me
to
--
well
perhaps
i
ought
to
discuss
the
--
the
freedom
of
a
franchise
a
little
later.
no,
i
will
develop
it
at
this
point
the
--
if
your
honor
pleases
since
we've
reached
that
point
and
come
back
to
the
first
amendment
and
the
arguments
of
the
court
a
little
later.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
freedom
of
the
franchise
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
has
so
far
having
developed
only
into
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
the
constitution
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
say
however
that
it
is
inherent
in
represented
democracy
that
the
will
of
the
people
should
be
reflected
in
the
election
of
their
people
and
that
anything
that
would
have
obstruct
that
would
be
inconsistent
by
our
entire
system
of
represented
democracy
as
set
forth
by
the
court
in
the
recent
cases
of
reynolds
against
sims,
etcetera.
now
the
court
has
adopted
the
instrument,
an
appropriate
one
of
the
equal
protection
clause
as
the
key
but
it
seems
inherent
in
our
democratic
system
that
the
will
of
the
people
should
not
be
prevented
by
an
existing
legislative
majority
which
very
often
has
been
elected
at
the
same
time
as
the
man
whose
case
is
in
issue.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
think
that
there
is
a
sufficient
standard
in
what
this
court
has
said
under
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
reynolds
against
sims
case
and
in
the
other
cases.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
is
enough.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right
and
in
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
except
that
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
used
by
this
court
specifically
and
repeatedly
in
recent
days
as
the
means
of
guaranteeing
freedom
of
the
franchise.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
i
can't
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
true
that
there
is
an
explicit
statement
in
the
constitution
with
respect
to
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
a
difference
but
i
think
the
equal
protection
clause
also
guarantee
although
it
doesn't
say
so,
freedom
of
the
franchise
and
to
eliminate
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
free
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
they
could
provide
--
i
think
the
equal
protection
clause
provides
that
a
particular
group
of
people
in
a
district
or
a
section
of
the
state
cannot
be
deprived
in
having
their
votes
counted.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
when
they
vote,
right.
and
in
that
case
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
equal
protection
and
that's
what
we
are
relying
upon
here.
now,
the
system
of
which
was
applied
here
of
denying
the
right
--
the
right
of
an
elected
representative
to
take
office
on
the
basis
of
qualification
enunciated
by
the
legislative
body
at
the
time
the
demand
appeared
to
take
office,
is
of
course
inconsistent
with
our
entire
history
or
federal
history
and
of
our
state
history.
and
when
the
issue
was
raised
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention,
the
federal
constitution
convention,
and
it
was
proposed
to
allow
a
legislature
to
determine
the
conditions
of
taking
office.
it
will
be
recalled
that
people
with
such
diverse
views
as
madison
and
hamilton
agreed
that
the
legislative
body
was
not
the
body
to
impose
the
qualifications,
contrary
to
what
the
constitution
itself
should
have
provided.
and
this
was
of
course
inherent
in
the
historic
struggle
in
england
which
madison
made
reference
and
refer
of
course
to
the
--
i
refer
of
course
to
the
wilkes
case.
and
that
to
the
attempt
by
a
--
the
english
parliament
to
present
mr.
wilkes
reelected
and
elected
several
times
from
taking
office.
if
i
may
return
for
the
moment
to
the
issue
of
the
freedom
of
speech
and
then
return
here,
let
me
indicate
that
the
court
below,
in
addition
to
adopting
a
standard
of
giving
less
protection
to
the
legislator
elect
in
the
freedom
of
speech
area,
adopted
a
self-imposed
system
of
restricted
judicial
review.
what
the
court
said
was
that
because
of
the
separation
of
power's
principle
and
the
principle
of
federalism,
it
would
not
protect
the
first
amendment
rights
in
this
case,
the
way
it
would
in
an
ordinary
case.
and
instead
it
would
apply
what
it
called
a
rational
evidentiary
rule
that
is
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
rational
basis
for
the
legislative
impairment
of
first
amendment
rights
in
this
case.
now
aside
from
the
fact
that
of
course,
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
have
repeatedly
--
despite
the
doctrine
as
a
federalism
and
a
separation
of
powers,
federal
courts
have
moved
into
the
protection
of
rights
against
state
body
and
courts
of
course,
by
virtue
of
their
inherent
function
have
protected
rights
even
though
the
rights
was
sought
to
be
taken
away
by
legislative
groups
or
by
the
executive
or
by
commissions.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
of
course.
i
agree
on
that.
now,
the
reason
why
the
courts
--
what
the
court
did
below
was
improper
in
our
view
was
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
first
amendment.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
regulation
of
property
under
the
due
process
clause.
and
i
think
what
was
said
in
west
virginia
against
barnette
and
in
succeeding
cases
indicates
a
distinction
between
the
standards
to
be
applied,
a
regulation
of
property
and
impairment
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
because
this
court
has
said
that
in
the
area
of
the
regulation
of
property,
the
standard
--
to
protect
the
standard
for
the
individual
will
not
be
as
great
as
where
the
first
amendment
right
is
involved?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
west
virginia
against
barnette.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
guess
i
have
misstated
it.
the
court
has
really
said
that
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
property
right
involved.
well,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
your
honor
that
the
court
said
that
where
property
is
involved,
the
test
of
protection
will
not
be
as
great.
the
amount
of
protection,
it
will
not
be
great
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
because
the
constitution
as
an
explicit
first
amendment
provision
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct,
that's
what
i
meant.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
has
to
be
more
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
which
explicitly.
that
is
quite
through.
now,
none
of
the
--
none
of
the
test
ever
used
by
this
court,
whether
it
was
the
clear
and
present
danger
of
schenck
or
whether
it
was
the
modification
of
chief
judge
hand
in
the
dennis
case,
adopts
it
by
a
majority
of
this
court
or
whether
if
the
sherbert
against
verner
case
of
a
compelling
state
interest.
none
of
these
tests
ever
moved
down
to
the
test
used
by
the
court
below
namely,
is
there
a
rational
basis
for
what
was
done.
the
court
below
in
using
this
rational
basis
test
drew
it
out
of
two
cases
that
has
no
possible
bearing
on
the
issues
here.
those
cases
were
the
thompson
against
louisville
and
garner
against
louisiana
where
--
what
the
court
did
here
--
there
was
to
reverse
convictions
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
semblance,
no
iota
of
evidence
to
support
the
convictions
under
the
due
process
clause.
and
of
course
that
has
--
it
cannot
be
applied
here
because
i
think
that
not
even
the
appellees
would
urge
that
if
there
was
an
iota
of
evidence
to
justify
the
impairment
of
first
amendment
rights
that
this
court
could
sustain
the
court
below.
now
the
appellees
rely
upon
a
decent
kind
of
rational
evidence
--
evidentiary
test.
they
referred
to
the
cases
of
konigsberg
and
schare
cases
involving
application
through
admission
to
the
bar.
and
it
is
--
those
are
the
cases
which
--
in
which
this
court
sustaining
applicants
for
members
of
the
bar,
i'm
talking
about
the
first
(inaudible)
case.
now,
as
held
that
upon
an
examination
of
the
whole
record
of
that
record,
does
not
show
a
rational
basis
for
the
denial
of
membership
with
the
bar
that
the
court
will
not
sustain
the
denial
by
the
character
committee
involved.
but
of
course,
there
is
a
very
real
distinction
between
an
application
for
admission
to
the
bar
on
the
basis
of
good
character
to
be
determined
by
a
character
committee
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
person
who
is
elected
by
the
people
of
his
district
is
to
be
--
is
to
take
his
seat.
whatever
may
be
the
test,
i'm
not
rearguing
now
the
test
that
was
used
in
schware
and
konigsberg.
so
i
would
argue
with
an
absolute
right,
despite
political
views
or
opinions.
whatever
may
be
the
test
in
the
bar
cases,
that
test
certainly
can't
be
applied
where
you
not
only
have
the
question
of
freedom
of
speech.
but
you
have
the
question
of
giving
voice
to
the
electoral
vote
of
the
people
here.
our
view
i
believe
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
have
them
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
have
not
argued
that
in
our
brief
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
frequent
statements
by
the
court
on
that
subject,
and
because
we
don't
think
it
necessary
to
press
the
issue.
we
think
that
we
have
enough
here
in
terms
of
both
the
first
amendment
and
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
i'm
not
briefed
with
that.
now
even
if
we
take
any
test
other
than
the
absolute
test
which
we
have
suggested
if
necessary
in
order
to
vindicate
not
only
the
first
amendment
rights
but
the
equal
protection
clause
here.
we
think
on
this
record,
the
court
below
acted
unreasonably
and
arbitrarily
and
that
there
is
nothing
to
sustain
the
view
that
the
statements
made
my
mr.
bond
are
inconsistent
with
his
constitutional
duty
or
show
that
he
would
not
care
--
he
would
not
execute
his
oaths
of
office.
i
come
shortly
to
the
question
of
what
the
oath
of
office
actually
means.
because
as
mr.
moore
has
indicated,
the
statements
that
were
made
here
by
mr.
bond,
although
we
would
argue
that
they
would
be
protected
if
they
were
in
the
form
of
a
speech,
of
a
leaflet,
of
an
argument
in
the
marketplace,
were
actually
as
indicated
a
response
to
an
inquiry
made
by
a
reporter.
whatever
the
cases
might
suggest
and
we
have
seen
none
that
are
against
us
on
this
on
the
subject
of
incitement,
on
the
subject
of
attempting
to
instigate
overreaction,
none
of
that
happens
to
be
in
this
case.
as
i
say,
i
would
argue
that
mr.
bond's
right
to
go
into
the
seat
make
the
same
statement
was
absolutely
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
but
here,
we
do
not
have
any
of
that.
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
said
fairly
that
in
this
record,
the
remarks
made
by
mr.
bond
support
an
argument
that
a
compelling
state
interest
justifies
this
infringement
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
now
tending
for
the
moment
for
the
question
of
the
georgia
constitution
and
the
oath
of
office,
the
court
below
recognized
that
there
was
no
qualification
set
forth
in
the
georgia
constitution
which
was
not
met
by
mr.
bond,
and
that
he
was
disqualified
under
any
of
the
specific
provision.
what
it
said
however
was
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
--
the
belief
by
the
legislative
body
that
mr.
bond
could
not
conscientiously
take
the
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
georgia.
an
oath
which
is
set
forth
at
page
47
of
our
brief
and
which
provides
in
the
following
language,
i
will
support
the
constitution
of
this
state
and
of
the
united
states
and
on
all
questions
and
measures
which
may
come
before
me,
i
will
so
conduct
myself
as
well
in
my
judgment
the
most
conducive
to
the
interest
and
prosperity
of
the
state.
this
said
to
legislature,
mr.
bond
was
not
able
to
take
because
of
the
public
expressions
of
opinions
that
he
had
made.
and
of
course
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
that
is
a
very
real
distinction.
i
think
that
there's
no
question
but
that
he
had
to
take
the
oath
if
he
wanted
to
take
office.
this
oath
is
a
--
first
of
all,
the
oath
itself
or
at
least
part
of
it
is
required
by
article
vi,
clause
3
of
the
federal
constitution
which
require
state
legislators
to
take
the
oath
to
support
the
federal
constitution.
the
oath
--
and
that
is
really
our
point
here
mr.
justice
harlan
is
a
mode
of
taking
office
not
a
standard
by
which
the
judge,
the
fitness
of
the
man
to
take
office.
it
is
like
all
of
these
oaths
of
taking
office,
a
promissory
oath,
a
solemnification
of
the
important
step
of
taking
office.
and
it
is
not
to
minimize
it
in
the
slightest
to
say
that
it
is
not
intended
as
a
method
of
refusing
to
let
people
take
the
oath,
which
was
done
in
the
present
case.
there
is
a
new
jersey
superior
court
decision
which
i
may
--
will
ask
the
court
to
leave
--
to
cite
since
i
have
not
put
it
in
my
brief
but
told
our
opponents
about
imbrie
against
marsh
in
which
judge
bigelow
discussed
this
particular
problem
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
imbrie,
i-m-b-r-i-e
your
honor
against
marsh.
judge
bigelow
in
5
new
jersey
superior
239
said,
"it
is
a
promise
and
assurance
of
future
conduct.
it
is
not
a
device
for
making
some
persons
ineligible
for
office."
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
will
agree
that
this
is
a
step
which
must
be
taken
by
everyone
who
wants
to
take
office
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
say
that
it's
such
an
extreme
case
even
in
such
an
extreme
case.
there
is
no
question.
i
shouldn't
put
it
that
way.
that
is
my
opinion
that
that
he
would
be
permitted
to
take
the
oath
of
office.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
once
you
move
away
from
the
function
of
the
oath
namely,
that
it's
merely
the
preliminary
step
to
taking
--
carrying
out
your
official
function
and
turn
it
into
something
which
could
be
examined
in
the
point
of
view
of
determining
whether
the
man
can
consciously
or
properly
or
means
to
take
the
oath,
then
you
move
into
an
unlimited
area
which
is
exactly
the
area
that
we
rendered
to
here.
an
examination
of
his
background
of
the
statements
of
what
he
had
intended.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
not
critical
to
my
case,
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
even
if
i
said
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
even
if
he's
--
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
he
said
i
will
take
the
oath
and
renounce
it
or
take
the
oath
and
not
mean
it
to
--
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
take
the
oath
and
he
would
have
a
right
to
take
office.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
we
are
still
met
here
with
the
basic
issue
whether
the
legislative
body
to
action
is
valid.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right.
and
we
would
also
be
left
--
i
would
also
have
in
reserve
so
far
as
this
oath
is
concerned,
the
whole
question
of
whether
it's
not
unconstitutionally
vague
under
the
decision
in
baggett
against
bullitt
and
under
the
decision
in
cramp
against
florida.
because
this
oath
viewed
now
as
the
--
as
was
done
below
as
a
standard
of
behavior
does
raise
a
question
of
vagueness
and
does
involve
the
same
first
amendment
problem
that
led
the
court
in
bagett
against
bullitt
and
cramp
against
florida
and
several
others
which
was
the
greatest
division
of
the
court.
they
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
oath
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
case
would
be
exactly
the
same
and
of
course,
exactly
the
case
that
we
have
here.
since
the
georgia
legislature
and
its
members
as
we
note
from
the
amicus
curie
briefs
which
have
developed
this
in
detail
consists
of
members
who
have
repeatedly
and
officially
as
legislators,
taken
the
position
that
the
decisions
of
the
court
protective
of
civil
liberties
that
the
decisions
of
the
courts
in
the
field
of
civil
rights
are
not
to
be
obeyed.
and
i
would
say
that
the
--
all
of
those
people
when
the
georgia
legislature
have
taken
these
positions
violative
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
american
citizens
have
a
right
to
take
their
position
and
cannot
be
precluded
even
though
if
one
were
to
adopt
the
standard
we
have
just
discussed,
one
could
say,
"none
of
them
could
conscientiously
take
this
oath
of
office".
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
exactly
our
of
point.
and
we
are
in
our
right
are
no
different
in
this
respect
than
those
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
as
to
what
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
as
to
what
the
oath
of
office
means.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
true
your
honor.
of
course,
the
members
of
the
georgia
legislature
have
gone
further,
they
have
taken
actions.
the
georgia
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
have
taken
actions
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
and
we
have
--
mr.
bond
has
taken
no
actions.
mr.
bond
stated
his
opinion,
and
yet
i
would
even
say
as
to
the
georgia
legislators
who
took
the
various
actions
depriving
the
citizens
of
georgia,
perceivably
the
negro
citizens
of
their
constitutional
rights.
that
even
those
actions
could
not
be
the
basis
for
depriving
them
of
the
right
to
sit
in
the
legislature
or
to
sit
in
the
government's
chair
of
georgia.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
say
that
the
fact
that
a
man
who
may
be
a
governor
elect
has
taken
a
position
against
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
or
has
taken
even
action
to
deprive
them
of
that
constitutional
rights,
cannot
deprive
him
of
the
right
to
sit.
our
situation
is
a
much
simpler
here
--
matter
here.
we
have
done
nothing
except
to
speak,
and
speak
and
response
to
a
question
that
was
questioned.
but
i
am
--
as
i
say,
i
think
this
constitutional
provision
cannot
be
used
even
as
addressed
to
the
conduct
because
it
is
a
promissory
oath.
looking
to
the
future
is
as
i
suggested
before
and
as
judge
bigelow
indicated,
it
is
a
solemnification
of
the
step
of
taking
office.
it
is
not
something
by
which
we
are
to
judge
the
conduct
and
certainly
not
something
by
which
we
are
to
judge
the
speech.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly
the
same
result
would
follow,
that
it
would
be
improper.
that
congress
cannot
use
an
oath
of
office
as
a
mean
for
excluding
people,
deprive
them
of
the
right
to
sit
because
of
what
they
have
said.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
our
basic
position
and
that
was
why
i
said
at
the
beginning,
i
thought
that
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it's
contrary
to
the
first
amendment,
the
constitution.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
exactly
our
position.
so
we
think
in
this
case
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
all
for
statements
made
subsequent
to
oath.i
think
the
problems
after
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now
with
respect
to
action
taken
after
a
man
is
sitting
in
the
house,
action,
there
i
think
we
may
have
a
different
problem
and
it
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
it
would
constitute
disorderly
behavior
or
misconduct
within
the
meaning
of
those
clauses
relating
to
the
expulsion.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
after
election,
after
being
seated
--
i
didn't
quite
follow
whetner
that
was
the
condition.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
the
--
if
we
are
in
the
context
of
the
present
problem,
we're
talking
about
speech.
then
whether
the
speech
is
before
or
after
would
make
no
difference,
it
would
be
constitutionally
protected.
i
didn't
know
whether
your
honor
was
referring
to
action
taken
afterwards.
if
action
were
taken
afterwards
then
we
would
present
it
with
a
very
different
problem,
the
problem
presented
by
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
house
has
the
power
of
expulsion
which
poses
completely
a
different
historical
problems
i
think
and
also
questions
of
what
misconduct
means.
but
we
are
--we
avoid
that
problem,
we
don't
have
that
before
us
because
we
have
only
the
problem
of
conduct
of
speech
antecedent
to
taking
office.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
had
suggested
before
in
my
argument
that
i
thought
that
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
--
or
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
law,
equal
protection
of
the
laws
provision
to
deny
the
will
of
the
electorate
by
rejecting
somebody
who
has
been
offered
--
who
has
been
elected
by
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
does
create
a
problem
and
a
problem
which
i
think
i
can
avoid
by
indicating
that
i
agree
that
the
triggering
factor
here
and
the
admitted
factor,
there's
no
dispute
as
to
this
is
the
statement
of
mr.
bond,
the
public
expression
of
opinion.
i
think
that
is
the
trigger.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
gives
the
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
as
your
honor
will
see
from
our
brief,
we
are
also
of
the
opinion
that
the
bill
of
attainder
provision
is
applicable
here.
and
that
it
does
trigger
the
right
of
the
court
to
intervene.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now
as
to
due
process
it
would
depend
--
as
to
due
process
i
have
more
doubt.
i
think
that
it
is
the
--
sorry
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
precisely
because
of
the
special
position
which
has
been
recognized
the
first
amendment
possesses,
relationship
to
what
the
court
has
said,
"the
vitality
of
our
institution".
because
it
is
an
explicit
provision
of
the
constitution
and
because
it
is
then
given
--
put
it
one
way
or
the
other,
this
preferred
status
that
the
first
amendment
will
always
be
able
to
trigger
the
protective
use
of
the
judicial
arm.
i
should
like
to
add
mr.
justice
fortas
that
of
course,
bearing
in
mind
the
fact
that
we
also
have
speech
of
the
particular
kind
relating
to
national
issue,
we
are
also
relying
upon
the
fact
that
upon
the
specific
immunities
and
privileges
clause
requiring
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
court
of
course
in
baker
against
carr
was
able
clearly
to
distinguish
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
luther
against
borden
involving
the
republican
form
of
government
and
held
that
where
specific
rights
were
being
denied.
in
fact
that
it
might
also
involve
a
derogation
of
the
republican
form
of
government
and
trusted
to
the
political
arm
did
not
mean
that
the
court
would
indicate
the
rights
involved
there.
and
so
here
we
think
where
we
have
a
first
amendment
right
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
court's
historic
power
to
bend
the
case.
i
--
but
know
whether
you
had
a
question,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
--
i
can
answer
you,
i
think
that
its
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
as
far
as
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
so
far
as
this
court
is
concern,
we
are
not
arguing
that
that
was
the
fact.
we
are
relying
upon
the
first
amendment
issues
here.
i
think
that
--
i
will
not
argue
the
bill
of
attainder
issue
but
merely
indicate
to
the
court
that
i
think
that
under
the
levitz-watson
dodd
case.
this
is
clearly
a
bill
of
attainder
because
one
looks
at
the
charges
that
were
made
against
mr.
bond
at
the
kinds
of
questions
that
were
put
together.
at
the
results
that
follow,
it
is
clearly
a
legislative
determination
of
guilt
of
this
loyalty
of
something
approaching
sedition
of
something
approaching
oppositions
to
the
national
interest
which
in
the
light
of
what
has
occurred
up
to
now
is
clearly
a
permanent.
it
would
make
no
difference
or
would
temperate
permanent
proscription
from
office.
this
is
a
very
different
question
from
the
question
of
judging
the
qualifications.
that
is
determining
whether
a
man
linked
standard
specifically
set
forth
in
the
constitution
at
which
the
quasi
judicial
function
familiar
to
the
court.
here
we
have
a
legislative
determination
where
there
is
no
standard
set
forth
in
the
legislation
or
constitution.
a
trial,
and
no
one
who
raise
his
extended
record
and
sees
the
cross
examination
of
mr.
bond
by
his
judges
can
doubt
that
he
went
through
a
real
trial
as
to
its
political
opinions
and
views
and
that
he
was
found
guilty
and
declared
not
once
but
three
--
that
twice
ineligible
to
serve
in
a
legislature.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
reelected
overwhelmingly
last
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
i
think
not.
i
think
the
issue
is
--
the
continuing
efforts
of
the
legislature
which
we
can
anticipate
are
going
to
be
unchanged
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
don't,
but
we
know
that
they
have
taken
--
that
they
have
announced
that
he
is
ineligible
for
office,
that
is,
they
originally
announced
that
they
reiterated
the
second
time.
because
when
mr.
bond
was
elected
a
second
time,
the
rule
--
the
committee
of
the
legislature
held
a
hearing
in
which
in
essence
they
said
to
him,
will
you
recant?
and
he
said
no,
i
stand
on
the
same
position
and
they
said,
"ineligible".
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
there
is
in
this
case
also
a
stipulation
providing
in
the
event
a
judgment
will
be
rendered
in
favor
of
mr.
bond
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
salary
which
was
specified.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
on
january
11,
i
think
--
on
january
11
of
this
coming
year,
the
new
legislature
to
which
he
has
been
elected
will
set
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
that
problem
is
really
a
different
one.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it's
a
different
one
because
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
handle
its
own
proceedings
and
to
be
sure
that
somebody
doesn't
interfere
with
them
or
the
--
doesn't
engage
in
misconduct
in
the
course
of
those
proceedings.
now
i
recognize
--
and
this
is
--
and
the
protection
of
that
right
is
indicated
by
of
course
the
two-third
vote
which
is
historically
applicable
to
that
kind
of
situation.
i
turn
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
two-third
vote
required
to
expel.
i
do
not
however
concede
that
if
the
legislature
attempted
to
expel
one
for
public
statement
of
his
opinions,
whether
it
was
on
state
issues
or
via
on
federal
issues
that
that
could
--
the
expulsion
could
be
sustained
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
should
say
your
honor
first
that
and
i
will
--
that
in
--
all
--
the
cases
your
honor
has
mentioned
--
i'm
sorry,
well,
affinitive
with
the
--
with
some
of
those
cases
it
was
far
more
than
speech
involved.
there
were
actions
taken
by
late
senator
mccarthy,
subject
to
the
senate
propagation.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
i
would
also
question
except
under
the
broadest
construction
to
bring
(inaudible)
on
the
floor
a
violation
of
the
rules
of
the
legislative
body
to
be
an
active
association.
but
i
would
say
that
those
are
hard
of
cases
and
the
--
i
don't
want
to
try
to
solve
or
to
attempt
to
solve
a
harder
case
involving
a
question
whether
what
one
is
doing
is
that
expression
of
speech
or
as
of
conduct.
i
think
we
have
a
so
much
simpler
case
here
of
pure
speech,
and
i
think
pure
speech
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
pure
expression
of
opinion
which
cannot
conceivably
prevent
the
problem
which
might
be
presented
by
these
harder
cases.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
the
preparing
with
the
proceedings
of
a
legislative
body
and
speaking
to
a
--
giving
freedom
of
expression
to
his
views
in
talking
to
a
newspaper
recorder.
if
i
may
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you.
mr.
moore
will
do
the
rebuttal
your
honor.
