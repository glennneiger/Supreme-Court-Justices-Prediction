mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court,
the
northern
district
of
georgia
dismissing
the
complaint
and
action
brought
to
compel
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
to
admit
an
elective
representative,
julian
bond.
the
plaintiffs
were
not
on
in
mr.
bond,
but
dr.
martin
luther
king,
a
constituent
and
resident,
mrs.
(inaudible),
a
resident
and
registered
voter,
each
suing
as
members
of
their
respective
classes.
the
plaintiffs
sought
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
a
special
house
resolution
excluding
mr.
bond.
the
plaintiffs
also
sought
injunction
against
the
state
constitutional
provisions
upon
which
the
house
relied
to
exclude
him.
the
appellees
are
james
'sloppy'
floyd,
an
elder
state
official
who
is
acting
in
concert
with
him.
a
general
election
was
held
in
georgia
on
june
15,
1965.
that
election
was
conducted
pursuant
to
legislation
enacted
in
the
weight
of
the
decision
in
toombs
against
fortson
as
a
result,
house
district
136
was
created.
mr.
bond
was
opposed
in
that
election
by
malcolm
j.dean,
who
was
a
dean
of
men
at
atlanta
university
in
atlanta.
in
that
election,
bond
polled
2320
votes
to
487
votes
for
dean.
more
persons
voted
in
bond's
district,
in
district
136
then
in
any
other
district
within
the
entire
state.
there
are
6500
voters
in
house
district
136,
6000
of
them
are
negroes.
about
two
weeks
before,
mr.
bond
was
scheduled
to
have
been
sworn
in
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives.
samuel
young,
a
worker
with
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
and
it
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
a
worker
sir
with
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
known
variously
and
popularly
as
sncc.
young
was
a
navy
veteran.
he
was
shot
and
killed
near
a
gasoline
service
station
in
tuskegee,
alabama.
young
had
lost
one
of
his
kidneys
in
the
ill-fated
bay
of
pig
--
the
bay
of
pigs
invasion
off
the
coast
of
cuba
in
1961.
he
was
approaching
the
service
station
to
use
the
restroom.
samuel
young
was
very
well
liked
within
sncc.
three
days
after
young's
funeral
on
january
6,
1966,
sncc
issued
the
statement
to
the
press,
critical
of
american
policy
in
vietnam
and
of
his
pass
for
respecting
equal
rights
for
negroes
in
the
united
states.
the
entire
statement
is
set
forth
at
pages
135
to
137
of
the
record.
the
statement
plays
responsibility
for
the
murder
of
samuel
young
upon
the
federal
government.
the
statement
equated,
the
failure
of
the
administration
to
protect
samuel
young
with
the
death
of
vietnamese
peasants
resulting
from
the
aggressive
foreign
policy
conductive
in
the
violation
of
international
law.
the
following
four
paragraphs
are
perhaps
the
most
relevant
paragraphs
to
these
procedures
and
i
shall
read
from
the
record
at
page
137.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
those
paragraphs
recite
as
follows.
we
are
in
sympathy
with
and
support
the
men
in
this
country
who
are
unwilling
to
respond
to
a
military
draft,
which
would
compel
them
to
contribute
their
lives
to
united
states'
aggression
in
vietnam
in
the
name
of
the
freedom
we
find
so
close
in
this
country.
we
recoil
with
horror
at
the
inconsistency
of
a
supposedly
free
society
where
responsibility
to
freedom
is
equated
with
responsibility
to
men
--
oneself
to
military
aggression.
we
take
note
to
the
fact
that
16%
of
the
draftees
from
this
country
are
negroes
called
on
to
stay
for
liberation
in
vietnam
to
preserve
a
democracy
which
does
not
exist
with
them
at
home.
we
ask,
where
is
the
draft
for
the
freedom
fight
of
the
united
states?
we
therefore
encourage
those
americans
who
prefer
to
use
their
energy
in
building
democratic
forums
within
this
country.
we
believe
that
work
in
the
civil
rights
movement
and
with
other
human
relations
organizations
is
a
valid
alternative
to
the
draft.
we
urge
all
americans
to
seek
this
alternative.
going
full
well,
it
may
cost
their
lives
as
painfully
as
in
vietnam.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
he
did
not
participate
in
drawing
the
statement.
i
think
that
that's
shown
at
page
41
of
the
record.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
its
41
sir.
a
following
release
of
the
statement
later
in
the
afternoon,
a
newsman
employed
by
a
state-owned
radio
station,
wgst
in
atlanta
caused
union
buying
at
home.
and
i
have
to
repeat,
mr.
bond
was
at
home
at
that
time
he
received
this
particular
call.
the
newsman
asked
by
who
did
not,
as
we
said
earlier,
participate
in
drafting
the
statement
whether
he
endorsed
the
sncc
statement
by
replied
he
did
and
added,
as
a
pacifist
he
was
opposed
to
all
laws
and
was
eager
and
anxious
to
encourage
people
not
to
participate
in
it
for
any
reason
that
they
chose.
the
newsman
pressed
bond
to
specify
his
reasons
for
endorsing
the
statement.
and
bond
said,
"i
agree
of
the
statement
because
of
the
reasons
set
forth
in
it,
because
i
think
it's
sort
of
hypocritical
for
us
to
maintain
that
we
are
fighting
for
liberty
in
other
places
and
were
not
guaranteeing
liberty
to
citizens
inside
the
communal
of
united
states".
he
was
further
pressed
by
the
newsman
and
he
reiterated
his
pacifist
beliefs.
and
he
indicated
that
he
was
opposed
to
either
side
killing
in
vietnam.
that
is
to
the
united
states
killing
in
vietnam
and
to
the
vietcong
killing
in
vietnam.
and
that
his
temperament
was
such
that
he
was
opposed
to
abrupt
changes.
this
may
be
found
in
the
record
of
page
114.
on
the
morning
of
january
10,
1966,
mr.
bond
arrived
in
the
house
of
representatives
to
take
his
oath
as
a
representative
elect
from
the
136
house
district.
now
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
mr.
bond
had
gone
to
the
house
of
representatives.
he'd
gone
there
earlier
in
--
about
two
years
earlier
to
observe
a
proceeding
and
he
was
forcefully
ejected
from
the
house.
the
clerk
on
this
occasion
in
january
10th,
1966,
ordered
him
to
stand
aside
as
the
oath
was
administered
to
other
representatives.
challenges
were
filed
to
mr.
bond's
right
to
be
sworn
and
seated.
the
challenges
were
signed
by
at
least
75
white
members
of
the
house.
they
were
based
upon
mr.
bond's
statement
to
the
press,
the
petitions
charged
among
other
things
that
bond's
actions
and
statements
gave
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemies
of
the
united
states,
violated
the
selective
service
law,
tended
to
bring
discredit
and
disrespect
to
the
house
of
representatives.
the
challenges
are
set
out
in
the
record
at
pages
13th
and
15th.
also
said
that
mr.
bond's
statements
indicated
that
he
could
not
take
the
oath,
they
were
repugnant
to
the
oath.
a
special
committee
then
was
composed
for
the
rules
committee
and
three
additional
members,
including
two
negro
members.
i
should
say
they
were
approximately
eight
negroes
who
were
in
the
house.
this
was
the
first
time
that
a
negro
had
sat
in
the
house
since
1907
and
this
was
due
to
reapportionment
and
one
other
white
representative
from
fulton
county.
a
hearing
was
held
on
the
challenge
petitions
for
the
expressed
privilege
of
deciding
the
substance
of
what
mr.
bond
said
and
the
intentions
behind
what
he
said.
for
evidence,
they
introduced
the
tape
of
a
phone
interview
on
january
6,1966,
a
tape
of
an
interview
with
mr.
bond
in
the
hall
of
the
state
capital
immediately
after
the
clerk
refused
to
administer
the
oath
to
him.
and
they
call
mr.
bond
as
a
witness
apparently
against
himself.
there
is
note
of
this
tape
are
on
file
and
available
to
the
court.
at
the
hearing,
mr.
bond
was
asked
whether
he
admired
the
courage
of
people
who
burnt
their
draft
cards.
and
his
reply
was,
"i
admire
people
who
take
who
take
an
action
and
admire
people
who
feel
strongly
enough
about
their
convictions
to
take
an
action
knowing
the
consequences
they
will
face.
and
that
was
my
original
statement
when
asked
a
question".
mr.
bond
called
four
witnesses
who
urged
proceeding
and
stated
that
he
deserved
the
right
to
be
seated.
one
of
those
witnesses
was
his
opponent
in
the
democratic
primary.
the
other
was
his
opponent
in
the
general
election.
the
other
two
witnesses
were
the
two
negro
members
of
the
georgia
state
senate.
the
special
committee
then
recommended
that
mr.
bond
not
to
be
seated.
a
two-negro
member
dissented
along
a
white
legislator
from
fulton
county.
the
house
then
adopted
house
resolution
19
not
to
seat
mr.
bond
in
accordance
with
the
majority
recommendation
from
the
special
committee.
mr.
bond
and
his
constituents
then
brought
this
action
for
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
judgment.
on
february
14,
1966,
the
special
three-judge
court
rendered
--
filed
a
judgment
against
the
appellees.
it
unanimously
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
because
the
plaintiffs
had
a
series
--
substantial
first
amendment
rights.
the
court
--
chief
judge
tuttle
dissenting
struck
from
the
complaint
the
names
of
the
appellants
other
than
mr.
bond
on
the
grounds
that
they
like
such
a
direct
interest
in
the
litigation
which
would
give
them
standing
to
bring
the
complaint.
on
the
merits,
the
court
was
also
divided.
the
majority
agreed
that
the
substantial
issue
in
the
case
rests
on
the
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech
or
to
dissent
under
the
first
amendment.
nevertheless,
it
held
that
mr.
bond's
statements,
an
affirmation
of
the
sncc
statement
as
they
go
on
the
functioning
of
the
selective
service
system
could
reasonably
be
said
to
be
inconsistent
with
and
repugnant
to
the
oath
which
he
would
be
required
to
take.
since
the
exclusion
and
while
this
case
has
been
pending
on
appeal,
mr.
bond
has
been
twice
reelected
to
office.
the
first
reelection
occurred
in
february
of
1966.
he
was
unopposed
in
that
election,
he
won
it
by
682
vote
to
none.
he
was
again
reelected
on
november
8,
1966,
justice
tuesday,
by
a
vote
of
2136
to
948.
that
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
mr.
bond
is
the
choice
of
the
voters
in
house
district
136.
but
with
respect
to
the
legal
issues
presented
or
raised
by
these
set
of
facts,
mr.
boudin
will
develop
them
in
detail.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court.
we'll
be
extremely
brief.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
record
page
116
in
the
following
language
of
mr.
bond.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
with
respect
to
what
he
meant
by
his
statement
in
his
position.
he
says,
"i
have
suggested
that
congressionally
outline
alternatives
to
military
draft
to
extend
it
to
building
democracy
at
home.
the
posture
of
my
life
for
the
past
five
years
has
been
calculated
to
give
me
a
grip,
the
ability
to
participate
the
formulation
of
public
policies.
the
fact
of
my
election
to
public
office
does
not
lessen
my
duty
or
desire
to
express
my
opinions
even
when
they
differ
from
those
held
by
others".
i
think
that
statement
is
very
significant,
it
was
before
the
house
of
representatives
as
to
what
mr.
bond
meant.
additionally,
with
respect
to
our
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
reiterate
it,
his
pacifist
beliefs
at
that
point.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
his
pacifist
beliefs,
his
own
objections
to
war.
but
with
respect
to
others,
he
had
in
mind
encouraging
them
to
seek
congressional
alternatives
to
the
draft
and
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
fact
that
there
are
congressional
alternatives
to
the
draft,
congressionally
provided
alternatives
to
the
draft.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
the
--
and
their
right,
our
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
there
is
alternative
service,
the
peace
corps
is
one
i
think
that
this
statement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
under
the
conscientious
objective
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
the
other
point
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
his
own
beliefs
would
be
the
only
basis.
he
may
have
an
out
by
selecting
service
into
safe
--
for
example
the
public
health
service
as
an
alternative
to
military
service
or
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
well
he'd
had
to
be
convicted
and
that
would
be
a
different
thing.
does
that
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
but
he
could
select
one
of
the
alternative
services.
noncombatant
military
service
or
service
in
the
forestry
service
or
service
in
the
public
health
or
some
other
congressionally
provided
alternative
to
military
draft.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
that
would
be
adequate,
yes
sir.
the
other
point
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
he
did
indicate
that
he
was
a
pacifist.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
that's
not
indicated
by
the
record.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
no
sir.
that
he
should
serve
and
the
question
was
not
put
to
him
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
serve.
he
never
--
he's
never
refused
to
serve.
he
did
indicate
that
he
had
a
draft
card
and
he
did
produced
it
--
offered
to
produce
the
draft
card
at
the
legislative
hearing.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
not
necessarily,
not
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
siegel
(ph)
case
but
--
perhaps
it
have
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
it
would
have
to
have
some
religious
training
and
belief
but
not
necessarily
a
belief
in
the
supreme
being.
if
you
could
prove
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
some
religious
influence
on
the
decision.
it
appears
from
the
decisions
of
a
court.
some
religious
influence
that
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
--
well,
as
to
religious
belief.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law
sir.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question
but
i'm
not
defending
on
that
ground.
i'm
defending
on
the
ground
that
he
has
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
express
those
views
and
not
could
be
excluded
from
the
legislature.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
if
i
may
move
on
to
the
note
which
we'd
like
to
conclude,
is
that
the
state,
the
respondents
construe
article
vi
provision
with
respect
to
the
oath
to
be
synonymous
with
support
of
the
government
or
support
of
a
particular
administration.
the
article
itself
provide
support
of
the
constitution
and
that's
a
very
meaningful
and
such
as
to
the
distinction
that
one
can't
support
the
constitution
in
good
faith
unconscientiously
and
not
support
the
particular
policies
of
a
given
administration.
and
that
dramatizes
what
i
think
has
been
an
unconstitutional
application
of
that
provision
in
this
particular
case.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court,
the
northern
district
of
georgia
dismissing
the
complaint
and
action
brought
to
compel
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
to
admit
an
elective
representative,
julian
bond.
the
plaintiffs
were
not
on
in
mr.
bond,
but
dr.
martin
luther
king,
a
constituent
and

the

sought
an
injunction
against

of
a
special

the

also
sought

a
general
election
was
held
in
georgia
on
june
15,
1965.
that
election
was
conducted
pursuant
to
legislation
enacted
in
the
weight
of
the
decision
in
toombs
against
fortson
as
a
result,
house
district
136
was
created.
mr.
bond
was
opposed
in
that
election
by
malcolm
j.dean,
who
was
a
dean
of
men
at
atlanta
university
in
atlanta.
in
that
election,
bond
polled
2320
votes
to
487
votes
for
dean.
more
persons
voted
in
bond's
district,
in
district
136
then
in
any
other
district
within
the
entire
state.
there
are
6500
voters
in
house
district
136,
6000
of
them
are
negroes.
about
two
weeks
before,
mr.
bond
was
scheduled
to
have
been
sworn
in
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives.
samuel
young,
a
worker
with
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
and
it
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
a
worker
sir
with
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
known
variously
and
popularly
as
sncc.
young
was
a
navy
veteran.
he
was
shot
and
killed
near
a
gasoline
service
station
in
tuskegee,
alabama.
young
had
lost
one
of
his
kidneys
in
the
ill-fated
bay
of
pig
--
the
bay
of
pigs
invasion
off
the
coast
of
cuba
in
1961.
he
was
approaching
the
service
station
to
use
the
restroom.
samuel
young
was
very
well
liked
within
sncc.
three
days
after
young's
funeral
on
january
6,
1966,
sncc
issued
the
statement
to
the
press,
critical
of
american
policy
in
vietnam
and
of
his
pass
for
respecting
equal
rights
for
negroes
in
the
united
states.
the
entire
statement
is
set
forth
at
pages
135
to
137
of
the
record.
the
statement
plays
responsibility
for
the
murder
of
samuel
young
upon
the
federal
government.
the
statement
equated,
the
failure
of
the
administration
to
protect
samuel
young
with
the
death
of
vietnamese
peasants
resulting
from
the
aggressive
foreign
policy
conductive
in
the
violation
of
international
law.
the
following
four
paragraphs
are
perhaps
the
most
relevant
paragraphs
to
these
procedures
and
i
shall
read
from
the
record
at
page
137.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
those
paragraphs
recite
as
follows.
we
are
in
sympathy
with
and
support
the
men
in
this
country
who
are
unwilling
to
respond
to
a
military
draft,
which
would
compel
them
to
contribute
their
lives
to
united
states'
aggression
in
vietnam
in
the
name
of
the
freedom
we
find
so
close
in
this
country.
we
recoil
with
horror
at
the
inconsistency
of
a
supposedly
free
society
where
responsibility
to
freedom
is
equated
with
responsibility
to
men
--
oneself
to
military
aggression.
we
take
note
to
the
fact
that
16%
of
the
draftees
from
this
country
are
negroes
called
on
to
stay
for
liberation
in
vietnam
to
preserve
a
democracy
which
does
not
exist
with
them
at
home.
we
ask,
where
is
the
draft
for
the
freedom
fight
of
the
united
states?
we
therefore
encourage
those
americans
who
prefer
to
use
their
energy
in
building
democratic
forums
within
this
country.
we
believe
that
work
in
the
civil
rights
movement
and
with
other
human
relations
organizations
is
a
valid
alternative
to
the
draft.
we
urge
all
americans
to
seek
this
alternative.
going
full
well,
it
may
cost
their
lives
as
painfully
as
in
vietnam.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
he
did
not
participate
in
drawing
the
statement.
i
think
that
that's
shown
at
page
41
of
the
record.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
its
41
sir.
a
following
release
of
the
statement
later
in
the
afternoon,
a
newsman
employed
by
a
state-owned
radio
station,
wgst
in
atlanta
caused
union
buying
at
home.
and
i
have
to
repeat,
mr.
bond
was
at
home
at
that
time
he
received
this
particular
call.
the
newsman
asked
by
who
did
not,
as
we
said
earlier,
participate
in
drafting
the
statement
whether
he
endorsed
the
sncc
statement
by
replied
he
did
and
added,
as
a
pacifist
he
was
opposed
to
all
laws
and
was
eager
and
anxious
to
encourage
people
not
to
participate
in
it
for
any
reason
that
they
chose.
the
newsman
pressed
bond
to
specify
his
reasons
for
endorsing
the
statement.
and
bond
said,
"i
agree
of
the
statement
because
of
the
reasons
set
forth
in
it,
because
i
think
it's
sort
of
hypocritical
for
us
to
maintain
that
we
are
fighting
for
liberty
in
other
places
and
were
not
guaranteeing
liberty
to
citizens
inside
the
communal
of
united
states".
he
was
further
pressed
by
the
newsman
and
he
reiterated
his
pacifist
beliefs.
and
he
indicated
that
he
was
opposed
to
either
side
killing
in
vietnam.
that
is
to
the
united
states
killing
in
vietnam
and
to
the
vietcong
killing
in
vietnam.
and
that
his
temperament
was
such
that
he
was
opposed
to
abrupt
changes.
this
may
be
found
in
the
record
of
page
114.
on
the
morning
of
january
10,
1966,
mr.
bond
arrived
in
the
house
of
representatives
to
take
his
oath
as
a
representative
elect
from
the
136
house
district.
now
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
mr.
bond
had
gone
to
the
house
of
representatives.
he'd
gone
there
earlier
in
--
about
two
years
earlier
to
observe
a
proceeding
and
he
was
forcefully
ejected
from
the
house.
the
clerk
on
this
occasion
in
january
10th,
1966,
ordered
him
to
stand
aside
as
the
oath
was
administered
to
other
representatives.
challenges
were
filed
to
mr.
bond's
right
to
be
sworn
and
seated.
the
challenges
were
signed
by
at
least
75
white
members
of
the
house.
they
were
based
upon
mr.
bond's
statement
to
the
press,
the
petitions
charged
among
other
things
that
bond's
actions
and
statements
gave
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemies
of
the
united
states,
violated
the
selective
service
law,
tended
to
bring
discredit
and
disrespect
to
the
house
of
representatives.
the
challenges
are
set
out
in
the
record
at
pages
13th
and
15th.
also
said
that
mr.
bond's
statements
indicated
that
he
could
not
take
the
oath,
they
were
repugnant
to
the
oath.
a
special
committee
then
was
composed
for
the
rules
committee
and
three
additional
members,
including
two
negro
members.
i
should
say
they
were
approximately
eight
negroes
who
were
in
the
house.
this
was
the
first
time
that
a
negro
had
sat
in
the
house
since
1907
and
this
was
due
to
reapportionment
and
one
other
white
representative
from
fulton
county.
a
hearing
was
held
on
the
challenge
petitions
for
the
expressed
privilege
of
deciding
the
substance
of
what
mr.
bond
said
and
the
intentions
behind
what
he
said.
for
evidence,
they
introduced
the
tape
of
a
phone
interview
on
january
6,1966,
a
tape
of
an
interview
with
mr.
bond
in
the
hall
of
the
state
capital
immediately
after
the
clerk
refused
to
administer
the
oath
to
him.
and
they
call
mr.
bond
as
a
witness
apparently
against
himself.
there
is
note
of
this
tape
are
on
file
and
available
to
the
court.
at
the
hearing,
mr.
bond
was
asked
whether
he
admired
the
courage
of
people
who
burnt
their
draft
cards.
and
his
reply
was,
"i
admire
people
who
take
who
take
an
action
and
admire
people
who
feel
strongly
enough
about
their
convictions
to
take
an
action
knowing
the
consequences
they
will
face.
and
that
was
my
original
statement
when
asked
a
question".
mr.
bond
called
four
witnesses
who
urged
proceeding
and
stated
that
he
deserved
the
right
to
be
seated.
one
of
those
witnesses
was
his
opponent
in
the
democratic
primary.
the
other
was
his
opponent
in
the
general
election.
the
other
two
witnesses
were
the
two
negro
members
of
the
georgia
state
senate.
the
special
committee
then
recommended
that
mr.
bond
not
to
be
seated.
a
two-negro
member
dissented
along
a
white
legislator
from
fulton
county.
the
house
then
adopted
house
resolution
19
not
to
seat
mr.
bond
in
accordance
with
the
majority
recommendation
from
the
special
committee.
mr.
bond
and
his
constituents
then
brought
this
action
for
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
judgment.
on
february
14,
1966,
the
special
three-judge
court
rendered
--
filed
a
judgment
against
the
appellees.
it
unanimously
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
because
the
plaintiffs
had
a
series
--
substantial
first
amendment
rights.
the
court
--
chief
judge
tuttle
dissenting
struck
from
the
complaint
the
names
of
the
appellants
other
than
mr.
bond
on
the
grounds
that
they
like
such
a
direct
interest
in
the
litigation
which
would
give
them
standing
to
bring
the
complaint.
on
the
merits,
the
court
was
also
divided.
the
majority
agreed
that
the
substantial
issue
in
the
case
rests
on
the
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech
or
to
dissent
under
the
first
amendment.
nevertheless,
it
held
that
mr.
bond's
statements,
an
affirmation
of
the
sncc
statement
as
they
go
on
the
functioning
of
the
selective
service
system
could
reasonably
be
said
to
be
inconsistent
with
and
repugnant
to
the
oath
which
he
would
be
required
to
take.
since
the
exclusion
and
while
this
case
has
been
pending
on
appeal,
mr.
bond
has
been
twice
reelected
to
office.
the
first
reelection
occurred
in
february
of
1966.
he
was
unopposed
in
that
election,
he
won
it
by
682
vote
to
none.
he
was
again
reelected
on
november
8,
1966,
justice
tuesday,
by
a
vote
of
2136
to
948.
that
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
mr.
bond
is
the
choice
of
the
voters
in
house
district
136.
but
with
respect
to
the
legal
issues
presented
or
raised
by
these
set
of
facts,
mr.
boudin
will
develop
them
in
detail.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court.
we'll
be
extremely
brief.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
record
page
116
in
the
following
language
of
mr.
bond.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
with
respect
to
what
he
meant
by
his
statement
in
his
position.
he
says,
"i
have
suggested
that
congressionally
outline
alternatives
to
military
draft
to
extend
it
to
building
democracy
at
home.
the
posture
of
my
life
for
the
past
five
years
has
been
calculated
to
give
me
a
grip,
the
ability
to
participate
the
formulation
of
public
policies.
the
fact
of
my
election
to
public
office
does
not
lessen
my
duty
or
desire
to
express
my
opinions
even
when
they
differ
from
those
held
by
others".
i
think
that
statement
is
very
significant,
it
was
before
the
house
of
representatives
as
to
what
mr.
bond
meant.
additionally,
with
respect
to
our
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
reiterate
it,
his
pacifist
beliefs
at
that
point.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
his
pacifist
beliefs,
his
own
objections
to
war.
but
with
respect
to
others,
he
had
in
mind
encouraging
them
to
seek
congressional
alternatives
to
the
draft
and
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
fact
that
there
are
congressional
alternatives
to
the
draft,
congressionally
provided
alternatives
to
the
draft.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
the
--
and
their
right,
our
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
there
is
alternative
service,
the
peace
corps
is
one
i
think
that
this
statement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
under
the
conscientious
objective
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
the
other
point
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
his
own
beliefs
would
be
the
only
basis.
he
may
have
an
out
by
selecting
service
into
safe
--
for
example
the
public
health
service
as
an
alternative
to
military
service
or
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
well
he'd
had
to
be
convicted
and
that
would
be
a
different
thing.
does
that
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
but
he
could
select
one
of
the
alternative
services.
noncombatant
military
service
or
service
in
the
forestry
service
or
service
in
the
public
health
or
some
other
congressionally
provided
alternative
to
military
draft.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
that
would
be
adequate,
yes
sir.
the
other
point
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
he
did
indicate
that
he
was
a
pacifist.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
that's
not
indicated
by
the
record.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
no
sir.
that
he
should
serve
and
the
question
was
not
put
to
him
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
serve.
he
never
--
he's
never
refused
to
serve.
he
did
indicate
that
he
had
a
draft
card
and
he
did
produced
it
--
offered
to
produce
the
draft
card
at
the
legislative
hearing.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
not
necessarily,
not
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
siegel
(ph)
case
but
--
perhaps
it
have
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
it
would
have
to
have
some
religious
training
and
belief
but
not
necessarily
a
belief
in
the
supreme
being.
if
you
could
prove
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
some
religious
influence
on
the
decision.
it
appears
from
the
decisions
of
a
court.
some
religious
influence
that
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
--
well,
as
to
religious
belief.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law
sir.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question
but
i'm
not
defending
on
that
ground.
i'm
defending
on
the
ground
that
he
has
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
express
those
views
and
not
could
be
excluded
from
the
legislature.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
if
i
may
move
on
to
the
note
which
we'd
like
to
conclude,
is
that
the
state,
the
respondents
construe
article
vi
provision
with
respect
to
the
oath
to
be
synonymous
with
support
of
the
government
or
support
of
a
particular
administration.
the
article
itself
provide
support
of
the
constitution
and
that's
a
very
meaningful
and
such
as
to
the
distinction
that
one
can't
support
the
constitution
in
good
faith
unconscientiously
and
not
support
the
particular
policies
of
a
given
administration.
and
that
dramatizes
what
i
think
has
been
an
unconstitutional
application
of
that
provision
in
this
particular
case.
thank
you.
