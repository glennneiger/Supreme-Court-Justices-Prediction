justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
get
your
idea.
you
should
go
to
something
inherent
to
determine
what
the
constitution
says.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
isn't
that
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
as
to
freedom
to
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
federal
constitution
provides
that
they
--
every
state
in
the
union
must
have
elections
to
elect
people
and
perhaps
to
vote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
--
you
put
your
case
to
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
constitutional
acquired
property
is
protected
by
the
constitution,
that
protection
of
the
property
which
is
accorded
there
would
be
less
than
in
the
event
that
first
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
it
would
be
after
the
constitution,
wouldn't
it?
what
it
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
certain
principles
with
relevance
to
property
and
certain
principles
with
reference
to
the
first.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
happens
to
be
more
to
the
reference
first.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
name
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
was
the
intent
of
making
a
statement
he
was
against
the
--
what
was
going
on
in
vietnam.
he
had
made
a
statement
that
he
was
against
the
enforcement
of
all
of
the
federal
laws
with
reference
to
any
discrimination
against
color
people
that
he
was
going
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
break
down
the
federal
laws
in
that
(inaudible)
would
the
case
be
any
different
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
taking
the
position
that
all
--
he
have
a
right
to
say
this,
that's
quite
different
to
doing
so
that
they
could
be
prosecuted
for
doing
it
can't
be
prosecuted
for
saying
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
you
meet
your
real
question,
don't
you
find
it,
after
what
the
provision
means
in
that
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
to
take
the
oath
of
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
to
whether
that
oath
of
office
can
to
that
extent
penalized
by
depriving
him
office
for
a
statement
publicly
made
which
--
but
for
that
would
undoubtedly
be
privileged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
taken
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
taken
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
he
hasn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
quite
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
in
congress
had
done
exactly
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
come
down
to
the
fact
that
there's
a
proposition,
do
you
not
that
merely
congress
now
the
state
legislative
can
hold
it
to
be
a
qualification
offered
to
the
man
have
not
yet
expressed
certain
views.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
contrary
to
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
first
amendment
or
contrary
to
the
amendment
about
the
quality
of
life
on
account
or
race
and
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
any
other
constitution
or
provision
for
that
could
not
be
the
basis
for
holding
that
either
a
senator
or
a
congressman
disqualified
by
the
legislative
body.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
the
word
qualification
to
mean
in
your
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
either
one
of
those
includes
a
disqualification
on
account
of
views?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
if
it
would
require
a
trial
in
order
to
determine
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
any
qualification
as
it
requires
a
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anything
about
good
character?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
really
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
very
nominal
qualification.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
can't
owe
money
to
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that's
not
involved
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anyone
that
is
involved
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
do
you
that
that
was
a
--
to
be
construed
as
meaning
or
the
man
swears
he
will
never
express
any
views
hostiles
to
government
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
of
course
the
number
of
the
judiciary
are
they
--
not
the
judiciary,
the
legislative
body,
do
express
their
views,
they
have
vigorously
against
policies
of
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
can't
be
taken
to
--
forbid
that,
can
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
legislature
can
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
be
bound
to
say
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
bound
to
say
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
said
they
had
this
sole
right
to
judge
of
his
qualification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
it's
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
they
imposed
an
unconstitutional
condition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
it
in
an
unconstitutional
manner,
i
suppose
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
that
you
are
not
qualified
because
of
something
about
you
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
but
supposed
he
said,
i'm
going
to
get
the
whole
of
this
school
desegregation
laws
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
supposed
to
all
of
these
school
desegregation
laws,
we
shouldn't
obey
them
then
and
his
right
to
speech
on
that,
would
that
require
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
they
could
put
him
out
on
that
--
they
have
been
able
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
hasn't
any
other
done
it
yet
or
were
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
reiterated
what?
justice
hugo

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

black
did
he
indicate
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
but
did
he
indicate
anywhere
that
he
would
serve
or
thought
he
should
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
in
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
rather
thought
his
statement
sounded
like
he
is
proud
of
his
views.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

black
i
don't
quite
get
your
idea.
you
should
go

justice

you

when

justice

black
is
that

justice

black
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
--
you
put
your
case
to
the
--
justice

black
you
mean
that
the
constitutional
acquired

is
protected
by
the

that

of
