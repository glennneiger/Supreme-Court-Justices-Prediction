mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
harris.
i'm
albert
harris,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
sir,
i'm
sorry
too.
mister
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
as
one
on
the
facts
then
the
harmless
error
rule
might
as
well
be
dumped
and
jettisoned
specifically
and
definitely
and
we'll
forget
about
it.
we
submit
that
the
error
here
was
harmless
whether
you
apply
the
california
rule
or
whether
you
apply
the
rule
announced
here
in
fahy
versus
connecticut.
now
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
touch
on
a
point
that
mr.
chief
justice
warren
raised,
the
argument
of
the
preceding
case,
and
that
was
the
suggestion
that
the
state,
the
attorney
general
that
argued
that
this
evidence
that
was
illegally
obtained
or
so
the
district
court
of
appeal
of
california
held
was
both
relevant
and
important.
i
think,
i'd
like
to
clarify
that,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
at
this
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
at
point
and
i
turn
to
page
253
in
the
record
filed
in
this
court
and
that
includes
a
portion
of
the
brief
filed
by
the
attorney
general
of
california
in
the
appellate
court
and
this
was
included
at
the
request
of
the
appellant,
mr.
cooper.
you'll
note
the
heading
of
the
argument,
its
part
two
of
the
brief,
the
whole
brief
doesn't
include
it
and
the
heading
is
this
"even
assuming
the
scrap
of
paper
was
illegally
seized
--"
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
on
page
253
of
the
printed
record,
your
honor.
even
assuming
the
scrap
of
paper
was
illegally
seized,
its
admission
was
not
prejudicial
error
and
what
follows
is
the
argument
addressed
to
that
proposition
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
you'll
notice
the
roman
numerals
two
at
the
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
start
and
that's
what
this
part
of
the
brief
is
addressed
to.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
this
was
an
argument
made
in
that
court
as
we're
arguing
here
that
the
error
was
not
prejudicial
assuming
there
was
any
error.
we
raised
in
the
brief
and
i'd
like
to
touch
on
that
point
if
i
have
any
time,
the
argument
that
the
search
here
was
not
unconstitutional
at
all.
in
fact,
it
was
a
constitutional
reasonable
search
and
the
evidence
is
admissible
but
i
don't
want
to
get
off
under
that
right
at
the
moment.
but
we
argue
that
it's
true
below
that
assuming
there
was
an
error,
that
error
was
not
prejudicial.
now,
we
did
say,
turning
over
to
page
254,
that
the
scrap
of
brown
paper
was
also
highly
relevant,
that's
about
two
thirds
all
the
way
down
the
page.
and
there
we
were
drawing
on
an
analogy
where
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
harem.
we
did
not
say
and
--
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
we
meant
to
say
any
place
that
this
evidence
was
important
in
the
sense
of
having
great
weight
in
the
disposition
and
decision
of
the
case.
we
did
say
it
was
highly
relevant
and
i
stand
by
that,
it
was
relevant.
we
don't
think
it
had
great
weight
in
effect
of
the
outcome
of
the
case
and
i
think
those
are
compatible
positions
to
please
the
court.
now,
it's
argued
that
the
district
attorney
puts
evidence
in.
he
thinks
it's
relevant
and
he
thinks
it's
going
to
contribute
to
the
conviction.
and
consequently,
who
was
he
to
come
up
here
and
say
that
it's
not
or
that
it's
only
a
harmless
error.
well,
that's
all
right
if
we're
penalizing
the
district
attorney.
but
that
is
not
what
the
appellate
court
set
for,
they
set
to
do
justice
and
the
constitution
of
california
imposes
that
duty
upon
them.
now,
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
district
attorney
believe
that
this
evidence
was
relevant
and
he
believed
it
was
admissible
and
he
believed
it
tended
to
prove
guilt,
otherwise,
he
wouldn't
have
put
it
in.
but
that's
true
in
every
case;
that's
true
in
every
case,
and
the
harmless
error
rule
presumes
that
the
evidence
will
be
relevant.
if
it
isn't
relevant
then
what
is
it
doing
in
the
case
to
start
with
and
in
itself
would
be
error
to
admit
it.
i
think
there's
no
question
that
if
--
that
the
rule
presupposes
some
degree
of
relevance;
that
it
does
tend
to
prove
guilt.
but
that's
not
the
complete
answer
because
if
it
were,
then
the
rule
would
be
reversal
and
not
a
careful
consideration
of
the
record
and
the
impact
of
the
evidence.
your
honors
have
made
it
clear,
going
back
to
kotteakos
and
even
clear
as
in
fahy
versus
connecticut,
if
you
please,
that
you
will
not
take
that
approach.
the
simple
approach,
if
it
was
received
in
evidence
and
relevant
than
we'll
reverse.
you
didn't
do
that
in
fahy
against
connecticut.
you
didn't
do
that
in
kotteakos
which
involved
a
different
problem
but
nevertheless
the
discussion
i
think
is
relevant.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'd
like
to
do
that
very
much,
your
honor.
now
if
i
can
lay
the
basis
for
it
in
just
a
moment
or
two.
joe
cooper
was
charged
with
selling
heroine
in
richmond,
california.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
heroine,
your
honor,
the
narcotic
drug.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
evidence
as
presented
by
the
people
very
briefly
was
like
this.
an
informant
had
agreed
to
call
copper,
make
arrangements
to
buy
heroine.
he
--
the
evidence
is
that
the
informant
dialed
the
number,
an
agent
over
listening
to
the
call.
this
was
cooper's
telephone
number.
that
is
the
place
that
he
was
residing.
a
lady
answers
the
phone
and
the
informant
asked
for
joe
and
joe
came
to
the
phone.
an
agent
overheard
the
conversation.
he
recognized
joe
cooper's
voice
over
the
telephone.
informant
says
"how
about
a
dukes?"
and
this
is
the
parlance
of
that
particular
business.
joe
said
"all
right"
and
the
informant,
they
said
or
he
said,
"where"?
and
the
informant
said
"over
at
newels
(ph)
market"
now
at
the
same
time
as
the
informant
for
placing
this
call
at
the
instructions
of
the
police
and
with
the
police
officer
right
there
hearing
it,
talking
to
cooper,
two
other
agents,
supposing
a
federal
agent
were
out
at
cooper's
residence
across
the
street
and
down
the
block.
they
observed
a
man
that
fit
the
resemblance
of
cooper.
they
were
a
couple
of
blocks
away
and
they
couldn't
be
entirely
certain,
come
out
and
get
into
his
car,
it
was
a
car
he
customarily
drove.
sure
enough,
he
turned
out
headed
towards
newels
market.
in
the
meantime,
the
officer
--
officers
who
were
with
the
informant
and
who
placed
the
call
took
him
up
near
newels
market.
well,
they
didn't
want
to
walk
up
and
drop
him
off
in
front
of
the
place
so
they
dropped
him
off
a
block
or
two
away
and
one
of
them
followed
him
and
there
were
two
other
agents
who
were
staked
out
in
other
positions.
now
they've
--
the
purpose
here
was
to
keep
this
informant
under
continual
observation.
they
had
searched
him
back
at
the
police
station.
so
that
they
could
exclude
the
possibility
that
if
he
returned
with
heroine,
he
got
it
from
anybody
except
cooper,
assuming
he
did
in
fact
contact
cooper.
if
they
couldn't
exclude
the
possibility
that
he
got
it
from
anyone
else,
they
would
not
be
satisfied
cooper
had
sold
him
the
heroine.
it's
not
only
a
matter
of
evidence
for
the
court
ultimately.
it's
a
matter
of
proving
these
to
themselves
because
they're
not
going
to
take
the
informant's
say
so.
and
they
did
the
best
they
could
to
keep
him
under
surveillance.
the
informant
without
going
into
all
of
the
detail
about
that,
and
there's
some
argument
about,
well,
a
couple
of
witnesses
said
looking
at
the
car,
it
appeared
to
be
cooper
and
a
couple
of
them
did.
there
were
several
identifications.
one
of
the
agents,
as
he
walked
up
to
the
front
of
newels
market
saw
cooper
turn
in,
turn
of
from
cutting
boulevard
and
head
towards
the
parking
lot.
he
identified
cooper
positively
driving
the
car,
this
was
cooper's
car.
they
--
most
of
them
had
seen
him
before,
observed
him
around
richmond.
two
of
the
officers
had
the
informant
in
sight
at
all
times
from
leaving
the
federal
agent's
car
walking
over
to
the
market,
going
in
the
lot,
contacting
cooper.
there
were
some
conflicts
and
mr.
traynor
has
pointed
them
out
with
great
detail.
the
defense
attorney
went
through
every
possible
detail
of
the
observation
and
there
were
some
inconsistencies
but
that
all
goes
to
the
question
of
sufficiency
and
it
goes
to
the
trial
judge.
in
the
event,
the
evidence,
there
is
sufficient
evidence
that
he
was
observed
at
all
times
and
mr.
green,
who
was
the
informant
returned
to
the
car,
a
federal
agent
waiting
for
him,
gave
him
two
bindles
of
heroine.
now,
the
bindles
are
white
paper
wrapped
around
a
white
powder
which
is
heroine
and
which
was
ultimately
analyzed
and
determined
to
be
heroine.
these
two
white
paper
bindles
were
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
brown
paper,
a
piece
of
grocery
sack
paper.
and
this
is
the
object
that
was
handed
to
the
federal
agent
in
the
car.
now,
that
is
not
the
piece
of
brown
paper
that
we're
talking
about
or
that
we're
concerned
about.
there
is
no
problem,
i
think,
before
this
court
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
heroine,
the
paper
in
which
the
heroine
was
contained.
i'll
get
to
the
piece
of
brown
paper
in
just
a
minute.
but
this
is
what
the
case
was
all
about;
it
was
whether
joe
cooper
sold
heroine
to
green,
the
informant.
they
had
given
the
informant
marked
money
as
their
common
practice.
so
that
if
they
picked
up
whoever
sold
him
the
heroine
and
found
the
money
on
him,
it
would
tend
to
corroborate
the
fact
of
the
sale.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
the
--
on
any
event,
mr.
cooper
--
there
was
an
attempt
to
follow
mr.
cooper
after
the
sale.
they
weren't
certain
it
was
heroine
at
this
point.
they
later
ran
a
field
test
on
it
down
at
the
police
station.
so
they
didn't
arrest
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
tried
to
follow
him
but
he
got
away.
they
staked
out
the
car
in
the
downtown
richmond,
and
about
two
to
three
hours
later,
arrested
joe
cooper
when
he
returned
to
the
car.
at
that
point,
according
to
the
agents,
he
said,
"there's
marijuana
or
marijuana
cigarettes
or
something
to
this
effect
under
the
visor
of
the
car,"
pointing
to
the
car.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
cooper,
your
honor,
the
defendant.
well,
it
didn't
turn
out
that
there
ever
was
any
marijuana
in
there.
but
at
the
time,
apparently
he
was
trying
to
distract
the
officers.
they'd
come
up
to
him
one
on
one
side,
one
to
the
other.
now,
when
--
after
he
made
this
comment,
they
looked
in
the
car,
he
put
over
--
took
his
left
hand
and
went
over
his
shirt
pocket,
pulled
out
a
small
object
wrapped
in
brown
grocery
sack
paper
or
in
brown
paper,
anyway.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
not
the
paper,
your
honor.
we
haven't
come
to
that
yet.
this
he
popped
in
his
mouth.
an
agent
attempted
to
grab
his
hand
and
the
--
both
hands
went
into
mr.
cooper's
mouth
and
he
bit
and
he
bit
hard
and
he
inflicted
serious
injuries
on
the
finger
of
the
agent.
well,
he
was
charged
with
that
too
but
i
won't
go
into
that
side
of
this
case.
but
we
still
haven't
come
to
the
piece
of
brown
paper
although
we
have
two
at
this
point.
but
neither
are
involved
here
and
there's
no
question
about
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
raised
here.
well,
he
goes
back
to
the
station
and
the
next
day,
he's
questioned
and
there's
no
argument
here
about
any
problem
in
the
questioning
and
he
admits
that
he
put
something
wrapped
in
brown
paper
in
his
mouth
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
again,
we're
not
--
to
the
evidence
we're
talking
about.
well,
in
all
of
these
things
that
i've
touched
on
i'd
intended
to
go
onto
greater
details
to
show
the
accuracy
of
the
evidence
in
the
following
of
mr.
green
to
make
the
buy
and
all
of
that
but
i
don't
want
to
pursue
that
on
great
length.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
we're
going
to
finally
going
to
get
to
that.
now,
the
piece
of
brown
paper
that
we're
talking
about
here;
first
is
mentioned
by
agent
broom
who
was
more
or
less
in
charge
of
this
operation.
he
is
called
a
witness
stand
by
the
people.
he
identifies
the
two
bindles
and
the
brown
paper
they
were
wrapped
in
which
constituted
the
sale
of
heroine
that
--
this
is
all
about.
that
is
not
the
brown
paper.
he
identified
that.
now,
the
defense
attorney
takes
him
on
cross-examination
and
he
says
to
him,
"well,
now,
what
about
this
other
piece
of
brown
paper"?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
one
we
haven't
gotten
to
yet.
but
this
is
the
way
the
record
reads,
your
honor
and
i'd
like
to
take
it
in
this
way
if
i
may.
the
defense
attorney
first
mentioned
that
he
said
this,
"now
perhaps
then
--
this
is
at
page
114
of
the
record.
now
perhaps
i
forgot
about
this
yesterday
or
didn't
see
it
or
didn't
perhaps
see
that,
"where
does
this
piece
of
paper
come
in"?
now
we
can't
tell
in
this
what
he
was
referring
to
but
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
defense
attorney.
or
has
it
been
described
by
any
of
the
witnesses?
answer
by
agent
broom,
"this
is
not
yet
been
described
or
brought
up,
there's
not
a
word
about
it
as
you
go,
uh,
through
the
trial
up
to
this
point"
so,
on
the
re-direct
examination
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
at
114,
also
set
out
in
our
brief
in
detail
your
honor
as
far
as
the
pages
go.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
on
a
re-direct
examination,
now,
the
district
attorney
in
his
direct
examination
didn't
mention
this
piece
of
brown
paper
that
we're
going
to
come
to.
he
didn't
mention
it
at
all.
the
defense
attorney
interjected
the
question
on
his
cross
and
i
don't
claim
any
invited
error
or
anything
of
that
kind
but
it
was
first
mentioned
by
the
defense.
on
a
re-direct,
the
district
attorney
comes
back
to
us,
and
that's
at
page
130
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
on
appeal
here.
and
then
he
says
"i'll
show
you
this
piece
of
brown
paper
and
ask
you
if
you
can
identify
that"
mr.
broom
says,
"that's
the
piece
of
paper
that
i
took
to
mr.
reeves
for
possible
comparison
that
i
found
at
the
glove
compartment
of
joe
cooper's
oldsmobile"
well,
when
did
you
find
it"?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
it,
we
finally
got
to
it.
and
what
happened
was,
about
a
week
after
and
that
the
date
isn't
too
certain,
and
was
about
a
week
after
the
arrest
though.
agent
broom,
for
some
reason,
the
reason
isn't
clear
anywhere,
went
back
to
joe
cooper's
oldsmobile
which
had
been
impounded.
it
wasn't
actually
his
but
he
was
--
he
had
possession
of
the
car.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
under
the
california
law,
your
honor,
which
requires
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
of
an
automobile
used
in
the
narcotics
traffic.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
was
your
honor.
have
been
in
the
possession
of
the
state
pending
proper
proceedings
to
forfeit
the
vehicle.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i'd
--
would
come
to
that
in
a
few
minutes
if
i
may
but
i'd
like
to
cover
what
this
is
we're
talking
about.
he
went
to
the
glove
compartment,
i
know
there's
no
--
where
evidence,
he
ransacked
the
car.
he
opened
the
glove
compartment,
and
found
it,
this
piece
of
brown
paper.
and,
now
what
was
it?
the
court
describes
it
over
on
page
131
of
the
record.
well
it's
a
piece
of
brown
paper
approximately
three
by
five
inches
contained
therein.
and
it
was
marked
as
a
part
of
a
same
exhibit
that
contained
the
paper
in
which
the
heroine
had
been
wrapped
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
two
bindles.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
not
at
this
point.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
presume
it
was
marked
at
about
at
this
point,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
think
what
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
we
do
not
have
a
procedure
like
that.
but
this
piece
of
paper
had
been
introduced
before
the
grand
jury
which
is
entirely
a
separate
proceeding
and
the
brown
paper
that
the
heroine
had
been
wrapped
in
plus
this
brown
paper
were
both
put
in
the
same
envelope
and
i
think
at
that
time
and
the
heroine
was
in
there
too
with
the
bindles.
and
that's
how
i
think
it
ended
up
in
the
same
exhibit.
obviously,
the
defense
attorney
had
to
see
it
some
place
because
he
wanted
to
know
what
it
was.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
three
by
five
inches,
your
honor.
so,
we've
got
the
brown
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
he
may
--
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
he
may
have
done
that.
now,
later
on
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
we
start
at
page
130
your
honor
where
it
is
marked
as
a
part
of
exhibit
four.
and
then
over
on
page
172,
exhibit
four
is
received
in
evidence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
believe
so,
yes
sir.
now
let
--
then
another
interesting
point
here
is
that
the
--
when
it
went
into
evidence
was
right
after
the
people
had
called
a
criminalist
who
identified
--
who
testified
that
the
heroine
was
heroine,
that
is
the
powder
was
heroine.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
two
pieces
of
brown
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
one,
that
the
paper
bindles
had
been
wrapped
in
at
the
time
of
the
buy,
the
other,
the
one
that
was
found
in
the
glove
compartment.
and
it
--
the
interesting
thing
is
that
when
this
exhibit
was
received
in
evidence,
the
criminalist
identified
the
bindles
and
that
they
contained
heroine
and
he'd
been
given
them
and
so
forth
and
there's
no
mention
at
that
particular
point
in
the
transcript
of
this
other
brown
piece
of
paper
but
it
was
no
doubt
it
was
received
in
evidence
together
with
the
others.
well,
now
that,
your
honors,
is
the
last
mentioned,
i
think
i'm
right
about
this,
and
if
i'm
not
i'll
be
corrected.
that
is
the
last
mention
of
that
piece
of
brown
paper
until
joe
cooper
is
up
in
the
district
court
of
appeals.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your,
honor,
that
additional
piece
of
brown
paper
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
connecting
mr.
cooper
to
that
heroine.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
did
not
--
didn't
have
much.
it
had
nothing
whatever
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
the
brief
it
said
your
honor,
that
it
was
the
same
--
this
is
the
brief
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
the
same
type
of
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
was
never
suggested
anywhere
that
all
of
this
pieces
of
brown
paper
came
from
the
same
source.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
--
the
attorney
general
made
that
statement
that
it
was
highly
relevant.
i
think
it
did
tend
to
show
this.
oh,
i
could
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
that
was
the
last
mention
of
that
brown
paper
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
it
lasted,
i
guess,
a
day
or
two,
your
honor.
it
was
a
court
trial;
was
not
a
jury
trial.
there
was
no
argument
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
as
there
frequently
is
not
at
the
--
in
a
court
trial.
at
least
in
california,
the
evidence
there,
it
is.
the
judge
when
he
found
joe
cooper
guilty
of
selling
heroine
and
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about,
stated
very
briefly,
we've
quoted
it
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
quote
that
same
language
but
what
he
felt
to
be
the
convincing
evidence,
the
defendant
at
the
close
of
the
defense
of
the
people's
case
moved
for
a
dismissal
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
about
the
state
of
the
case
at
that
moment.
pointing
out
for
example,
the
informant
hadn't
testified.
and
the
judge
said
this
at
page
208
of
the
printed
record,
"actually,
i
see
no
reason,
mr.
moran",
that
was
the
defense
attorney,
"this
believe
at
this
point
the
basic
testimony
of
the
officers.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
defendant
was
out
there.
i
have
no
doubt
that
green
was
out
there,
the
informant.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
contact
was
made.
the
two
bindles
are
here.
agent
lee
says
they
were
turned
over
to
him
by
mister
green
after
the
contact.
as
in
all
cases,
on
some
of
the
details
are
differences
of
opinion.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
be
most
unusual
if
this
were
not
so.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
at
page
208
of
the
printed
record,
your
honor.
and
then
there's
a
very
similar
statement
over
at
page
242
of
the
printed
record.
this
is
after
the
defendant
had
taken
the
stand.
and
what
does
the
defendant
testify
to?
he
testifies
to
an
alibi.
he
says
he
was
not
here
at
all.
he
says
he
didn't
receive
a
phone
call.
and
in
fact,
he
was
with
a
lady
he
knew
and
they've
gone
out
to
north
richmond
to
visit
a
--
among
other
people,
to
visit
her
father.
but
no
witnesses
calls
in
support
of
that
position.
and
it
stands
simply
on
his
testimony.
on
page
242,
the
judges
heard
the
evidence.
bear
in
mind
there's
no
jury,
so
it's
strictly
the
judge
deciding
the
case.
well
gentlemen,
there's
no
reasonable
doubt
or
otherwise
in
my
mind
that
the
phone
call
was
placed
as
testified.
and
that
the
officers
were
outside
the
defendant's
aunt's
home.
that
he
answered
the
phone
there.
that
he
did
go
over
to
newels
market
and
was
identified
there
and
met
mr.
green
and
mr.
green
thereafter
did
turn
over
the
bindles
in
evidence
to
agent
lee
and
they
were
found
to
be
heroine.
and
the
court
will
find
the
defendant
guilty.
no
mention
of
that
brown
paper
later
found
in
the
glove
compartment,
whatever.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
entire
exhibit
was
destroyed.
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
about
it
but
it
was
destroyed
sometime
after
the
district
court
of
appeals
had
resolved
the
case.
but
we
don't
have
it
here.
we
do
have
the
description
now;
it
was
described
in
the
record
as
somewhat
larger
than
the
piece
that
the
heroine,
the
bindles
of
heroine
was
wrapped
in,
somewhat
larger
piece
of
brown
paper.
there
was
never
any
evidence
that,
for
example,
that
they'd
matched
the
places
where
it
was
torn
to
indicate
that
it
was
--
that
would
--
had
been
torn
from
one
sheet.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
he
relies
in
this
court
your
honor?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
he
also
raises
a
question
of
confrontation,
a
failure
to
call
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
a
question
of
confrontation,
a
failure
to
call
the
informant
as
a
witness.
but
this
is
the
only
item
of
evidence
that
he
claims
to
constitute
a
constitutional
error.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
now,
we've
contrasted
in
our
brief
the
situation
in
this
case
and
fahy
against
connecticut,
for
example,
where
your
honors
have
looked
through
the
evidence
in
detail.
you
didn't
reverse
simply
on
the
basis
that
there
was
illegally
obtained
evidence
but
you
went
through
it
on
detail.
you
can
do
that
and
i
hope
you
will
with
this
piece
of
brown
paper.
it
doesn't
corroborate,
it
doesn't
tie
in,
it
doesn't
do
anything
as
to
the
phone
call,
as
to
the
observations
of
mr.
green,
as
to
the
instrumentality,
the
heroine
itself.
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
he
thought
it
would
tend
to
prove
guilt.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
bindles
of
heroine
are
wrapped
in
a
--
in
grocery
sack
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
the
ones
that
are
in
evidence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
there's
no
quarrel
about
that.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
to
find
mister
cooper
a
few
hours
later
with
a
piece
of
brown
grocery
sack
paper
in
his
car,
and
we
knew
he
made
the
sale
out
of
the
car.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
of
the
same
general
kind.
i
think
it
does
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
there
wasn't
any
discussion
of
it,
your
honor.
bear
in
mind
there
was
no
objection.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
it
was
the
same
kind.
it
was
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
was
the
same
kind.
it
was
a
grocery
sack
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
was
the
same.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
wouldn't
think
so.
it
was
the
same
kind
of
--
it
was
grocery
sack
paper
that's
what
it
was.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
to
find
cooper
in
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
was
no
objection
on
illegal
search
and
seizure
grounds.
the
only
objection
was
that
there
was
an
insufficient
chain,
that
is,
that
the
people
hadn't
shown
custody
from
the
point
of
seizure
to
the
point
of
introduction
into
evidence
because
it
was
left
with
the
grand
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
for
a
while.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
the
appellate
court,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
the
appellate
court.
and
the
appellate
court
had
found
that
there
had
been
a
change
of
the
law
between
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
hearing
of
the
appeal
so
that
the
defendant
could
properly
raise
the
objection
under
california
law.
but
there
was
no
objection
on
in
--
under
reasonable
search
and
seizure
ground
at
all
at
the
trial
to
this
evidence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
under
a
california
law
your,
honor,
that's
correct
because
there
was
a
change
in
the
law
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
appeals.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
--
not
in
the
sense
that
we
would
say
you
couldn't
entertain
the
question
or
something
like
that.
in
the
--
in
weighing
the
prejudice,
i
think
you
might
very
well
consider.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'm
--
i
am
just
saying,
your
honor
that
in
weighing
the
prejudice
of
this
evidence,
you
might
take
it
into
account
that
the
defendants
and
his
attorney
didn't
complain
of
any
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
i
don't
say
what
weight
you
give
that.
we
think
on
a
fair
appraisal
of
this
evidence,
the
whole
record
has
been
pointed
out
here
that
this
was
not
prejudicial
under
the
fahy
test.
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
applied
the
fahy
test
and
held
it
was
not
prejudicial
under
fahy
as
well
as
under
the
california
test.
now,
whether
you
--
whether
it
had
to
do
that
is
quite
a
different
question
but
they
did.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
they
held
that
was
unreasonable,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
have
argued
in
out
brief
at
some
length
and
i
see
my
time
is
just
about
out.
so
i'll
be
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
opinion
is
very
clear
that
they're
relying
on
the
fourth
amendment,
united
states
constitution.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
so
we're
asking
this
court
to
reconsider
or
to
consider
that
question
if
you
--
if
you
feel
that
the
harmless
error
rule
was
--
can't
be
applied
here.
if
you
think
you
have
to
get
to
the
search
and
hold
the
search
was
a
reasonable
search
even
though
it
was
several
days
after
the
arrest,
even
though
the
car
was
in
another
place.
and
we've
cited
authorities
in
support
of
that
proposition.
and
we
don't
think
it's
any
evasion
of
anyone's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
we
have
substantial
support
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
federal
--
the
circuit
courts,
and
i'll
submit
the
other
points,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
we
distinguish
it
this
way,
your
honor,
bob
preston
held
was
that
that
search
under
those
circumstances
was
not
incident
to
the
arrest.
and
that
was
--
we
--
in
our
view
a
very
sound
holding,
correct
holding.
we
don't
argue
here
that
the
search
was
incident
to
the
arrest
at
all.
we
argue
here
that
that
vehicle
was
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state
of
california
having
been
seized
pursuant
to
the
narcotic
forfeiture
law
although
it
could've
been
seized
as
an
instrumentality
and
have
been
held
as
evidence.
we
submit
that
when
a
car
is
held
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state,
the
state
may
make
a
search
of
that
car
without
getting
a
search
warrant
and
that
the
search
is
not
unreasonable.
we
apply
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
there
are
number
of
decision
as
the
maryland
decision
we've
cited
and
the
federal
court
of
appeals
decision
that
have
followed
this
reasoning.
and
we
think
a
very
sound
and
urge
the
court
to
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
hadn't
been
seized,
your
honor,
and
i
doubt
in
a
sense
that
it
was
in
lawful
custody,
that
is,
these
men
were
suspected
of
committing
vagrancy,
that's
all.
now,
you
don't
seize
a
car
because
you
suspect
somebody
is
guilty
of
vagrancy.
there's
no
authority
for
it
that
i
know
of.
certainly
not
in
california
and
i
don't
know
of
any
in
that
state
where
the
preston
case
arose.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
we
would
distinguish
it
from
that.
that's
not
to
say
that
that
search
would
necessarily
be
a
bad
search
as
your
honor
has
mentioned.
but
that
issue
isn't
really
before
us
because
of
--
before
you
because
that
--
this
car
was
seized
under
the
forfeiture
law.
and
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state,
i
think,
if
there's
any
question
about
that
then
you
have
quite
a
different
problem.
but
here,
the
car
was
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state
and
we
don't
think
was
any
evasion
of
mr.
cooper's
rights
to
look
inside
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
without
a
search
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
they
seized
it,
i
don't
know
that
they
stated
anything,
your
honor,
about
it.
they
seized
it
and
they've
put
it
in
a
garage.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
they
did
in
due
course;
they
hadn't
at
the
time
of
this
--
of
the
search
i
believe.
but
they
did
in
due
course
start
the
proceedings
to
forfeit
the
vehicle,
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
right
and
then
a
civil
action
is
filed
in
the
superior
court
in
california.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
certainly
is,
your
honor,
authority
to
seize.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
you
have
to
have
a
duty
to
seize
it
at
the
time
you
find
that
the
car
was
used
in
the
transportation
of
narcotics.
and
then
you
have
a
duty
although
it's
been
interpretedly
directed.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
our
procedure,
your
honor,
doesn't
--
it
wouldn't
require
an
action
by
him.
the
state
has
to
file
an
action
within,
i
think,
its
fifteen
days
under
the
controlling
statutes
that
we've
referred
to
here.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
state
has
to
file
the
action.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
car
was
parked
down
at
seventh
and
mcdonald
in
richmond.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
a
downtown
street
corner,
your
honor,
was
parked
in
a
parking
space.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
that's
not.
it
had
been
removed
to
a
place
called
the
beacon
toaster
service
where
it
was
being
held.
then
it
was
ultimately
later
removed
over
to
san
francisco
under
this
memorial
garage.
but
that's
the
normal
procedure.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
certainly
by
the
time
it
was
at
beacon
tow
service
at
the
time
of
the
search.
pardon
me?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
where
it
was
searched,
yes
sir;
where
they
found
the
brown
paper
we're
concerned
about.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
record
is
--
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that,
your
honor.
but
the
presumption
is
that
the
officers
of
the
state
took
it
as
it
were
their
duty
so
to
do.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'm
sure
he
didn't,
your
honor.
but
it
wasn't
his
car;
but
he
was
using
it;
it
had
been
loaned
to
him.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
now
let's
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
it
might
also
be
in
the
possession
of
the
state
under
some
other
theory,
for
example,
to
hold
it
as
evidence
in
the
case.
then
it
will
be
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state
and
could
be
examined
in
our
view
when
the
state
called
it
was
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
proper
to
do
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that
is
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
we
don't
say
the
state
owned
it,
your
honor.
we
say
it
was
in
lawful
custody.
the
state
wouldn't
own
it
until
such
time
as
the
narcotic
forfeiture
action
has
been
tried
and
concluded.
this
is
a
civil
action.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it's
in
lawful
custody
pending
determination
of
that
question.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
the
car
is
--
the
car
stays
in
the
custody
of
the
state
under
11611
of
the
health
and
safety
code
and
there's
no
provision
for
releasing
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
that
any
--
i
think
that's
substantially
it,
your
honor,
with
the
--
i
might
state
this
qualification
that
it
has
to
be
seized
under
such
circumstances
that
a
search
would
have
been
permissible
at
that
time.
and
in
a
narcotics
offense
where
the
narcotics
were
sold
from
the
car,
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
to
search
this
car
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
under
anybody's
view
of
the
law.
and
we
say
that
the
fact
it
was
searched
a
few
days
later,
it
having
come
into
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state
and
the
defendant
having
no
right
to
its
return
at
that
time,
then
the
search
is
not
unreasonable
within
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
thank
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
harris
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
harris.
i'm
albert
harris,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
sir,
i'm
sorry
too.
mister
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
as
one
on
the
facts
then
the
harmless
error
rule
might
as
well
be
dumped
and
jettisoned
specifically
and
definitely
and
we'll
forget
about
it.
we
submit
that
the
error
here
was
harmless
whether
you
apply
the
california
rule
or
whether
you
apply
the
rule
announced
here
in
fahy
versus
connecticut.
now
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
touch
on
a
point
that
mr.
chief
justice
warren
raised,
the
argument
of
the
preceding
case,
and
that
was
the
suggestion
that
the
state,
the
attorney
general
that
argued
that
this
evidence
that
was
illegally
obtained
or
so
the
district
court
of
appeal
of
california
held
was
both
relevant
and
important.
i
think,
i'd
like
to
clarify
that,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
at
this
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
at
point
and
i
turn
to
page
253
in
the
record
filed
in
this
court
and
that
includes
a
portion
of
the
brief
filed
by
the
attorney
general
of
california
in
the
appellate
court
and
this
was
included
at
the
request
of
the
appellant,
mr.
cooper.
you'll
note
the
heading
of
the
argument,
its
part
two
of
the
brief,
the
whole
brief
doesn't
include
it
and
the
heading
is
this
"even
assuming
the
scrap
of
paper
was
illegally
seized
--"
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
on
page
253
of
the
printed
record,
your
honor.
even
assuming
the
scrap
of
paper
was
illegally
seized,
its
admission
was
not
prejudicial
error
and
what
follows
is
the
argument
addressed
to
that
proposition
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
you'll
notice
the
roman
numerals
two
at
the
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
start
and
that's
what
this
part
of
the
brief
is
addressed
to.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
this
was
an
argument
made
in
that
court
as
we're
arguing
here
that
the
error
was
not
prejudicial
assuming
there
was
any
error.
we
raised
in
the
brief
and
i'd
like
to
touch
on
that
point
if
i
have
any
time,
the
argument
that
the
search
here
was
not
unconstitutional
at
all.
in
fact,
it
was
a
constitutional
reasonable
search
and
the
evidence
is
admissible
but
i
don't
want
to
get
off
under
that
right
at
the
moment.
but
we
argue
that
it's
true
below
that
assuming
there
was
an
error,
that
error
was
not
prejudicial.
now,
we
did
say,
turning
over
to
page
254,
that
the
scrap
of
brown
paper
was
also
highly
relevant,
that's
about
two
thirds
all
the
way
down
the
page.
and
there
we
were
drawing
on
an
analogy
where
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
harem.
we
did
not
say
and
--
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
we
meant
to
say
any
place
that
this
evidence
was
important
in
the
sense
of
having
great
weight
in
the
disposition
and
decision
of
the
case.
we
did
say
it
was
highly
relevant
and
i
stand
by
that,
it
was
relevant.
we
don't
think
it
had
great
weight
in
effect
of
the
outcome
of
the
case
and
i
think
those
are
compatible
positions
to
please
the
court.
now,
it's
argued
that
the
district
attorney
puts
evidence
in.
he
thinks
it's
relevant
and
he
thinks
it's
going
to
contribute
to
the
conviction.
and
consequently,
who
was
he
to
come
up
here
and
say
that
it's
not
or
that
it's
only
a
harmless
error.
well,
that's
all
right
if
we're
penalizing
the
district
attorney.
but
that
is
not
what
the
appellate
court
set
for,
they
set
to
do
justice
and
the
constitution
of
california
imposes
that
duty
upon
them.
now,
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
district
attorney
believe
that
this
evidence
was
relevant
and
he
believed
it
was
admissible
and
he
believed
it
tended
to
prove
guilt,
otherwise,
he
wouldn't
have
put
it
in.
but
that's
true
in
every
case;
that's
true
in
every
case,
and
the
harmless
error
rule
presumes
that
the
evidence
will
be
relevant.
if
it
isn't
relevant
then
what
is
it
doing
in
the
case
to
start
with
and
in
itself
would
be
error
to
admit
it.
i
think
there's
no
question
that
if
--
that
the
rule
presupposes
some
degree
of
relevance;
that
it
does
tend
to
prove
guilt.
but
that's
not
the
complete
answer
because
if
it
were,
then
the
rule
would
be
reversal
and
not
a
careful
consideration
of
the
record
and
the
impact
of
the
evidence.
your
honors
have
made
it
clear,
going
back
to
kotteakos
and
even
clear
as
in
fahy
versus
connecticut,
if
you
please,
that
you
will
not
take
that
approach.
the
simple
approach,
if
it
was
received
in
evidence
and
relevant
than
we'll
reverse.
you
didn't
do
that
in
fahy
against
connecticut.
you
didn't
do
that
in
kotteakos
which
involved
a
different
problem
but
nevertheless
the
discussion
i
think
is
relevant.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'd
like
to
do
that
very
much,
your
honor.
now
if
i
can
lay
the
basis
for
it
in
just
a
moment
or
two.
joe
cooper
was
charged
with
selling
heroine
in
richmond,
california.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
heroine,
your
honor,
the
narcotic
drug.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
evidence
as
presented
by
the
people
very
briefly
was
like
this.
an
informant
had
agreed
to
call
copper,
make
arrangements
to
buy
heroine.
he
--
the
evidence
is
that
the
informant
dialed
the
number,
an
agent
over
listening
to
the
call.
this
was
cooper's
telephone
number.
that
is
the
place
that
he
was
residing.
a
lady
answers
the
phone
and
the
informant
asked
for
joe
and
joe
came
to
the
phone.
an
agent
overheard
the
conversation.
he
recognized
joe
cooper's
voice
over
the
telephone.
informant
says
"how
about
a
dukes?"
and
this
is
the
parlance
of
that
particular
business.
joe
said
"all
right"
and
the
informant,
they
said
or
he
said,
"where"?
and
the
informant
said
"over
at
newels
(ph)
market"
now
at
the
same
time
as
the
informant
for
placing
this
call
at
the
instructions
of
the
police
and
with
the
police
officer
right
there
hearing
it,
talking
to
cooper,
two
other
agents,
supposing
a
federal
agent
were
out
at
cooper's
residence
across
the
street
and
down
the
block.
they
observed
a
man
that
fit
the
resemblance
of
cooper.
they
were
a
couple
of
blocks
away
and
they
couldn't
be
entirely
certain,
come
out
and
get
into
his
car,
it
was
a
car
he
customarily
drove.
sure
enough,
he
turned
out
headed
towards
newels
market.
in
the
meantime,
the
officer
--
officers
who
were
with
the
informant
and
who
placed
the
call
took
him
up
near
newels
market.
well,
they
didn't
want
to
walk
up
and
drop
him
off
in
front
of
the
place
so
they
dropped
him
off
a
block
or
two
away
and
one
of
them
followed
him
and
there
were
two
other
agents
who
were
staked
out
in
other
positions.
now
they've
--
the
purpose
here
was
to
keep
this
informant
under
continual
observation.
they
had
searched
him
back
at
the
police
station.
so
that
they
could
exclude
the
possibility
that
if
he
returned
with
heroine,
he
got
it
from
anybody
except
cooper,
assuming
he
did
in
fact
contact
cooper.
if
they
couldn't
exclude
the
possibility
that
he
got
it
from
anyone
else,
they
would
not
be
satisfied
cooper
had
sold
him
the
heroine.
it's
not
only
a
matter
of
evidence
for
the
court
ultimately.
it's
a
matter
of
proving
these
to
themselves
because
they're
not
going
to
take
the
informant's
say
so.
and
they
did
the
best
they
could
to
keep
him
under
surveillance.
the
informant
without
going
into
all
of
the
detail
about
that,
and
there's
some
argument
about,
well,
a
couple
of
witnesses
said
looking
at
the
car,
it
appeared
to
be
cooper
and
a
couple
of
them
did.
there
were
several
identifications.
one
of
the
agents,
as
he
walked
up
to
the
front
of
newels
market
saw
cooper
turn
in,
turn
of
from
cutting
boulevard
and
head
towards
the
parking
lot.
he
identified
cooper
positively
driving
the
car,
this
was
cooper's
car.
they
--
most
of
them
had
seen
him
before,
observed
him
around
richmond.
two
of
the
officers
had
the
informant
in
sight
at
all
times
from
leaving
the
federal
agent's
car
walking
over
to
the
market,
going
in
the
lot,
contacting
cooper.
there
were
some
conflicts
and
mr.
traynor
has
pointed
them
out
with
great
detail.
the
defense
attorney
went
through
every
possible
detail
of
the
observation
and
there
were
some
inconsistencies
but
that
all
goes
to
the
question
of
sufficiency
and
it
goes
to
the
trial
judge.
in
the
event,
the
evidence,
there
is
sufficient
evidence
that
he
was
observed
at
all
times
and
mr.
green,
who
was
the
informant
returned
to
the
car,
a
federal
agent
waiting
for
him,
gave
him
two
bindles
of
heroine.
now,
the
bindles
are
white
paper
wrapped
around
a
white
powder
which
is
heroine
and
which
was
ultimately
analyzed
and
determined
to
be
heroine.
these
two
white
paper
bindles
were
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
brown
paper,
a
piece
of
grocery
sack
paper.
and
this
is
the
object
that
was
handed
to
the
federal
agent
in
the
car.
now,
that
is
not
the
piece
of
brown
paper
that
we're
talking
about
or
that
we're
concerned
about.
there
is
no
problem,
i
think,
before
this
court
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
heroine,
the
paper
in
which
the
heroine
was
contained.
i'll
get
to
the
piece
of
brown
paper
in
just
a
minute.
but
this
is
what
the
case
was
all
about;
it
was
whether
joe
cooper
sold
heroine
to
green,
the
informant.
they
had
given
the
informant
marked
money
as
their
common
practice.
so
that
if
they
picked
up
whoever
sold
him
the
heroine
and
found
the
money
on
him,
it
would
tend
to
corroborate
the
fact
of
the
sale.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
the
--
on
any
event,
mr.
cooper
--
there
was
an
attempt
to
follow
mr.
cooper
after
the
sale.
they
weren't
certain
it
was
heroine
at
this
point.
they
later
ran
a
field
test
on
it
down
at
the
police
station.
so
they
didn't
arrest
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
tried
to
follow
him
but
he
got
away.
they
staked
out
the
car
in
the
downtown
richmond,
and
about
two
to
three
hours
later,
arrested
joe
cooper
when
he
returned
to
the
car.
at
that
point,
according
to
the
agents,
he
said,
"there's
marijuana
or
marijuana
cigarettes
or
something
to
this
effect
under
the
visor
of
the
car,"
pointing
to
the
car.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
cooper,
your
honor,
the
defendant.
well,
it
didn't
turn
out
that
there
ever
was
any
marijuana
in
there.
but
at
the
time,
apparently
he
was
trying
to
distract
the
officers.
they'd
come
up
to
him
one
on
one
side,
one
to
the
other.
now,
when
--
after
he
made
this
comment,
they
looked
in
the
car,
he
put
over
--
took
his
left
hand
and
went
over
his
shirt
pocket,
pulled
out
a
small
object
wrapped
in
brown
grocery
sack
paper
or
in
brown
paper,
anyway.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
not
the
paper,
your
honor.
we
haven't
come
to
that
yet.
this
he
popped
in
his
mouth.
an
agent
attempted
to
grab
his
hand
and
the
--
both
hands
went
into
mr.
cooper's
mouth
and
he
bit
and
he
bit
hard
and
he
inflicted
serious
injuries
on
the
finger
of
the
agent.
well,
he
was
charged
with
that
too
but
i
won't
go
into
that
side
of
this
case.
but
we
still
haven't
come
to
the
piece
of
brown
paper
although
we
have
two
at
this
point.
but
neither
are
involved
here
and
there's
no
question
about
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
raised
here.
well,
he
goes
back
to
the
station
and
the
next
day,
he's
questioned
and
there's
no
argument
here
about
any
problem
in
the
questioning
and
he
admits
that
he
put
something
wrapped
in
brown
paper
in
his
mouth
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
again,
we're
not
--
to
the
evidence
we're
talking
about.
well,
in
all
of
these
things
that
i've
touched
on
i'd
intended
to
go
onto
greater
details
to
show
the
accuracy
of
the
evidence
in
the
following
of
mr.
green
to
make
the
buy
and
all
of
that
but
i
don't
want
to
pursue
that
on
great
length.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
we're
going
to
finally
going
to
get
to
that.
now,
the
piece
of
brown
paper
that
we're
talking
about
here;
first
is
mentioned
by
agent
broom
who
was
more
or
less
in
charge
of
this
operation.
he
is
called
a
witness
stand
by
the
people.
he
identifies
the
two
bindles
and
the
brown
paper
they
were
wrapped
in
which
constituted
the
sale
of
heroine
that
--
this
is
all
about.
that
is
not
the
brown
paper.
he
identified
that.
now,
the
defense
attorney
takes
him
on
cross-examination
and
he
says
to
him,
"well,
now,
what
about
this
other
piece
of
brown
paper"?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
one
we
haven't
gotten
to
yet.
but
this
is
the
way
the
record
reads,
your
honor
and
i'd
like
to
take
it
in
this
way
if
i
may.
the
defense
attorney
first
mentioned
that
he
said
this,
"now
perhaps
then
--
this
is
at
page
114
of
the
record.
now
perhaps
i
forgot
about
this
yesterday
or
didn't
see
it
or
didn't
perhaps
see
that,
"where
does
this
piece
of
paper
come
in"?
now
we
can't
tell
in
this
what
he
was
referring
to
but
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
defense
attorney.
or
has
it
been
described
by
any
of
the
witnesses?
answer
by
agent
broom,
"this
is
not
yet
been
described
or
brought
up,
there's
not
a
word
about
it
as
you
go,
uh,
through
the
trial
up
to
this
point"
so,
on
the
re-direct
examination
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
at
114,
also
set
out
in
our
brief
in
detail
your
honor
as
far
as
the
pages
go.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
on
a
re-direct
examination,
now,
the
district
attorney
in
his
direct
examination
didn't
mention
this
piece
of
brown
paper
that
we're
going
to
come
to.
he
didn't
mention
it
at
all.
the
defense
attorney
interjected
the
question
on
his
cross
and
i
don't
claim
any
invited
error
or
anything
of
that
kind
but
it
was
first
mentioned
by
the
defense.
on
a
re-direct,
the
district
attorney
comes
back
to
us,
and
that's
at
page
130
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
on
appeal
here.
and
then
he
says
"i'll
show
you
this
piece
of
brown
paper
and
ask
you
if
you
can
identify
that"
mr.
broom
says,
"that's
the
piece
of
paper
that
i
took
to
mr.
reeves
for
possible
comparison
that
i
found
at
the
glove
compartment
of
joe
cooper's
oldsmobile"
well,
when
did
you
find
it"?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
it,
we
finally
got
to
it.
and
what
happened
was,
about
a
week
after
and
that
the
date
isn't
too
certain,
and
was
about
a
week
after
the
arrest
though.
agent
broom,
for
some
reason,
the
reason
isn't
clear
anywhere,
went
back
to
joe
cooper's
oldsmobile
which
had
been
impounded.
it
wasn't
actually
his
but
he
was
--
he
had
possession
of
the
car.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
under
the
california
law,
your
honor,
which
requires
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
of
an
automobile
used
in
the
narcotics
traffic.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
was
your
honor.
have
been
in
the
possession
of
the
state
pending
proper
proceedings
to
forfeit
the
vehicle.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i'd
--
would
come
to
that
in
a
few
minutes
if
i
may
but
i'd
like
to
cover
what
this
is
we're
talking
about.
he
went
to
the
glove
compartment,
i
know
there's
no
--
where
evidence,
he
ransacked
the
car.
he
opened
the
glove
compartment,
and
found
it,
this
piece
of
brown
paper.
and,
now
what
was
it?
the
court
describes
it
over
on
page
131
of
the
record.
well
it's
a
piece
of
brown
paper
approximately
three
by
five
inches
contained
therein.
and
it
was
marked
as
a
part
of
a
same
exhibit
that
contained
the
paper
in
which
the
heroine
had
been
wrapped
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
two
bindles.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
not
at
this
point.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
presume
it
was
marked
at
about
at
this
point,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
think
what
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
we
do
not
have
a
procedure
like
that.
but
this
piece
of
paper
had
been
introduced
before
the
grand
jury
which
is
entirely
a
separate
proceeding
and
the
brown
paper
that
the
heroine
had
been
wrapped
in
plus
this
brown
paper
were
both
put
in
the
same
envelope
and
i
think
at
that
time
and
the
heroine
was
in
there
too
with
the
bindles.
and
that's
how
i
think
it
ended
up
in
the
same
exhibit.
obviously,
the
defense
attorney
had
to
see
it
some
place
because
he
wanted
to
know
what
it
was.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
three
by
five
inches,
your
honor.
so,
we've
got
the
brown
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
he
may
--
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
he
may
have
done
that.
now,
later
on
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
we
start
at
page
130
your
honor
where
it
is
marked
as
a
part
of
exhibit
four.
and
then
over
on
page
172,
exhibit
four
is
received
in
evidence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
believe
so,
yes
sir.
now
let
--
then
another
interesting
point
here
is
that
the
--
when
it
went
into
evidence
was
right
after
the
people
had
called
a
criminalist
who
identified
--
who
testified
that
the
heroine
was
heroine,
that
is
the
powder
was
heroine.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
two
pieces
of
brown
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
one,
that
the
paper
bindles
had
been
wrapped
in
at
the
time
of
the
buy,
the
other,
the
one
that
was
found
in
the
glove
compartment.
and
it
--
the
interesting
thing
is
that
when
this
exhibit
was
received
in
evidence,
the
criminalist
identified
the
bindles
and
that
they
contained
heroine
and
he'd
been
given
them
and
so
forth
and
there's
no
mention
at
that
particular
point
in
the
transcript
of
this
other
brown
piece
of
paper
but
it
was
no
doubt
it
was
received
in
evidence
together
with
the
others.
well,
now
that,
your
honors,
is
the
last
mentioned,
i
think
i'm
right
about
this,
and
if
i'm
not
i'll
be
corrected.
that
is
the
last
mention
of
that
piece
of
brown
paper
until
joe
cooper
is
up
in
the
district
court
of
appeals.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your,
honor,
that
additional
piece
of
brown
paper
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
connecting
mr.
cooper
to
that
heroine.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
did
not
--
didn't
have
much.
it
had
nothing
whatever
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
the
brief
it
said
your
honor,
that
it
was
the
same
--
this
is
the
brief
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
the
same
type
of
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
was
never
suggested
anywhere
that
all
of
this
pieces
of
brown
paper
came
from
the
same
source.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
--
the
attorney
general
made
that
statement
that
it
was
highly
relevant.
i
think
it
did
tend
to
show
this.
oh,
i
could
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
that
was
the
last
mention
of
that
brown
paper
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
it
lasted,
i
guess,
a
day
or
two,
your
honor.
it
was
a
court
trial;
was
not
a
jury
trial.
there
was
no
argument
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
as
there
frequently
is
not
at
the
--
in
a
court
trial.
at
least
in
california,
the
evidence
there,
it
is.
the
judge
when
he
found
joe
cooper
guilty
of
selling
heroine
and
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about,
stated
very
briefly,
we've
quoted
it
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
quote
that
same
language
but
what
he
felt
to
be
the
convincing
evidence,
the
defendant
at
the
close
of
the
defense
of
the
people's
case
moved
for
a
dismissal
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
about
the
state
of
the
case
at
that
moment.
pointing
out
for
example,
the
informant
hadn't
testified.
and
the
judge
said
this
at
page
208
of
the
printed
record,
"actually,
i
see
no
reason,
mr.
moran",
that
was
the
defense
attorney,
"this
believe
at
this
point
the
basic
testimony
of
the
officers.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
defendant
was
out
there.
i
have
no
doubt
that
green
was
out
there,
the
informant.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
contact
was
made.
the
two
bindles
are
here.
agent
lee
says
they
were
turned
over
to
him
by
mister
green
after
the
contact.
as
in
all
cases,
on
some
of
the
details
are
differences
of
opinion.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
be
most
unusual
if
this
were
not
so.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
at
page
208
of
the
printed
record,
your
honor.
and
then
there's
a
very
similar
statement
over
at
page
242
of
the
printed
record.
this
is
after
the
defendant
had
taken
the
stand.
and
what
does
the
defendant
testify
to?
he
testifies
to
an
alibi.
he
says
he
was
not
here
at
all.
he
says
he
didn't
receive
a
phone
call.
and
in
fact,
he
was
with
a
lady
he
knew
and
they've
gone
out
to
north
richmond
to
visit
a
--
among
other
people,
to
visit
her
father.
but
no
witnesses
calls
in
support
of
that
position.
and
it
stands
simply
on
his
testimony.
on
page
242,
the
judges
heard
the
evidence.
bear
in
mind
there's
no
jury,
so
it's
strictly
the
judge
deciding
the
case.
well
gentlemen,
there's
no
reasonable
doubt
or
otherwise
in
my
mind
that
the
phone
call
was
placed
as
testified.
and
that
the
officers
were
outside
the
defendant's
aunt's
home.
that
he
answered
the
phone
there.
that
he
did
go
over
to
newels
market
and
was
identified
there
and
met
mr.
green
and
mr.
green
thereafter
did
turn
over
the
bindles
in
evidence
to
agent
lee
and
they
were
found
to
be
heroine.
and
the
court
will
find
the
defendant
guilty.
no
mention
of
that
brown
paper
later
found
in
the
glove
compartment,
whatever.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
entire
exhibit
was
destroyed.
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
about
it
but
it
was
destroyed
sometime
after
the
district
court
of
appeals
had
resolved
the
case.
but
we
don't
have
it
here.
we
do
have
the
description
now;
it
was
described
in
the
record
as
somewhat
larger
than
the
piece
that
the
heroine,
the
bindles
of
heroine
was
wrapped
in,
somewhat
larger
piece
of
brown
paper.
there
was
never
any
evidence
that,
for
example,
that
they'd
matched
the
places
where
it
was
torn
to
indicate
that
it
was
--
that
would
--
had
been
torn
from
one
sheet.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
he
relies
in
this
court
your
honor?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
he
also
raises
a
question
of
confrontation,
a
failure
to
call
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
a
question
of
confrontation,
a
failure
to
call
the
informant
as
a
witness.
but
this
is
the
only
item
of
evidence
that
he
claims
to
constitute
a
constitutional
error.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
now,
we've
contrasted
in
our
brief
the
situation
in
this
case
and
fahy
against
connecticut,
for
example,
where
your
honors
have
looked
through
the
evidence
in
detail.
you
didn't
reverse
simply
on
the
basis
that
there
was
illegally
obtained
evidence
but
you
went
through
it
on
detail.
you
can
do
that
and
i
hope
you
will
with
this
piece
of
brown
paper.
it
doesn't
corroborate,
it
doesn't
tie
in,
it
doesn't
do
anything
as
to
the
phone
call,
as
to
the
observations
of
mr.
green,
as
to
the
instrumentality,
the
heroine
itself.
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
he
thought
it
would
tend
to
prove
guilt.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
bindles
of
heroine
are
wrapped
in
a
--
in
grocery
sack
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
the
ones
that
are
in
evidence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
there's
no
quarrel
about
that.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
to
find
mister
cooper
a
few
hours
later
with
a
piece
of
brown
grocery
sack
paper
in
his
car,
and
we
knew
he
made
the
sale
out
of
the
car.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
of
the
same
general
kind.
i
think
it
does
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
there
wasn't
any
discussion
of
it,
your
honor.
bear
in
mind
there
was
no
objection.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
it
was
the
same
kind.
it
was
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
was
the
same
kind.
it
was
a
grocery
sack
paper.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
was
the
same.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
wouldn't
think
so.
it
was
the
same
kind
of
--
it
was
grocery
sack
paper
that's
what
it
was.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
to
find
cooper
in
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
was
no
objection
on
illegal
search
and
seizure
grounds.
the
only
objection
was
that
there
was
an
insufficient
chain,
that
is,
that
the
people
hadn't
shown
custody
from
the
point
of
seizure
to
the
point
of
introduction
into
evidence
because
it
was
left
with
the
grand
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
for
a
while.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
the
appellate
court,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
the
appellate
court.
and
the
appellate
court
had
found
that
there
had
been
a
change
of
the
law
between
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
hearing
of
the
appeal
so
that
the
defendant
could
properly
raise
the
objection
under
california
law.
but
there
was
no
objection
on
in
--
under
reasonable
search
and
seizure
ground
at
all
at
the
trial
to
this
evidence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
under
a
california
law
your,
honor,
that's
correct
because
there
was
a
change
in
the
law
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
appeals.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
--
not
in
the
sense
that
we
would
say
you
couldn't
entertain
the
question
or
something
like
that.
in
the
--
in
weighing
the
prejudice,
i
think
you
might
very
well
consider.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'm
--
i
am
just
saying,
your
honor
that
in
weighing
the
prejudice
of
this
evidence,
you
might
take
it
into
account
that
the
defendants
and
his
attorney
didn't
complain
of
any
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
i
don't
say
what
weight
you
give
that.
we
think
on
a
fair
appraisal
of
this
evidence,
the
whole
record
has
been
pointed
out
here
that
this
was
not
prejudicial
under
the
fahy
test.
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
applied
the
fahy
test
and
held
it
was
not
prejudicial
under
fahy
as
well
as
under
the
california
test.
now,
whether
you
--
whether
it
had
to
do
that
is
quite
a
different
question
but
they
did.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
they
held
that
was
unreasonable,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
have
argued
in
out
brief
at
some
length
and
i
see
my
time
is
just
about
out.
so
i'll
be
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
opinion
is
very
clear
that
they're
relying
on
the
fourth
amendment,
united
states
constitution.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
so
we're
asking
this
court
to
reconsider
or
to
consider
that
question
if
you
--
if
you
feel
that
the
harmless
error
rule
was
--
can't
be
applied
here.
if
you
think
you
have
to
get
to
the
search
and
hold
the
search
was
a
reasonable
search
even
though
it
was
several
days
after
the
arrest,
even
though
the
car
was
in
another
place.
and
we've
cited
authorities
in
support
of
that
proposition.
and
we
don't
think
it's
any
evasion
of
anyone's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
we
have
substantial
support
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
federal
--
the
circuit
courts,
and
i'll
submit
the
other
points,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
we
distinguish
it
this
way,
your
honor,
bob
preston
held
was
that
that
search
under
those
circumstances
was
not
incident
to
the
arrest.
and
that
was
--
we
--
in
our
view
a
very
sound
holding,
correct
holding.
we
don't
argue
here
that
the
search
was
incident
to
the
arrest
at
all.
we
argue
here
that
that
vehicle
was
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state
of
california
having
been
seized
pursuant
to
the
narcotic
forfeiture
law
although
it
could've
been
seized
as
an
instrumentality
and
have
been
held
as
evidence.
we
submit
that
when
a
car
is
held
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state,
the
state
may
make
a
search
of
that
car
without
getting
a
search
warrant
and
that
the
search
is
not
unreasonable.
we
apply
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
there
are
number
of
decision
as
the
maryland
decision
we've
cited
and
the
federal
court
of
appeals
decision
that
have
followed
this
reasoning.
and
we
think
a
very
sound
and
urge
the
court
to
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
hadn't
been
seized,
your
honor,
and
i
doubt
in
a
sense
that
it
was
in
lawful
custody,
that
is,
these
men
were
suspected
of
committing
vagrancy,
that's
all.
now,
you
don't
seize
a
car
because
you
suspect
somebody
is
guilty
of
vagrancy.
there's
no
authority
for
it
that
i
know
of.
certainly
not
in
california
and
i
don't
know
of
any
in
that
state
where
the
preston
case
arose.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
we
would
distinguish
it
from
that.
that's
not
to
say
that
that
search
would
necessarily
be
a
bad
search
as
your
honor
has
mentioned.
but
that
issue
isn't
really
before
us
because
of
--
before
you
because
that
--
this
car
was
seized
under
the
forfeiture
law.
and
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state,
i
think,
if
there's
any
question
about
that
then
you
have
quite
a
different
problem.
but
here,
the
car
was
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state
and
we
don't
think
was
any
evasion
of
mr.
cooper's
rights
to
look
inside
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
without
a
search
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
they
seized
it,
i
don't
know
that
they
stated
anything,
your
honor,
about
it.
they
seized
it
and
they've
put
it
in
a
garage.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
they
did
in
due
course;
they
hadn't
at
the
time
of
this
--
of
the
search
i
believe.
but
they
did
in
due
course
start
the
proceedings
to
forfeit
the
vehicle,
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
right
and
then
a
civil
action
is
filed
in
the
superior
court
in
california.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
certainly
is,
your
honor,
authority
to
seize.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
you
have
to
have
a
duty
to
seize
it
at
the
time
you
find
that
the
car
was
used
in
the
transportation
of
narcotics.
and
then
you
have
a
duty
although
it's
been
interpretedly
directed.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
our
procedure,
your
honor,
doesn't
--
it
wouldn't
require
an
action
by
him.
the
state
has
to
file
an
action
within,
i
think,
its
fifteen
days
under
the
controlling
statutes
that
we've
referred
to
here.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
state
has
to
file
the
action.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
car
was
parked
down
at
seventh
and
mcdonald
in
richmond.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
a
downtown
street
corner,
your
honor,
was
parked
in
a
parking
space.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
that's
not.
it
had
been
removed
to
a
place
called
the
beacon
toaster
service
where
it
was
being
held.
then
it
was
ultimately
later
removed
over
to
san
francisco
under
this
memorial
garage.
but
that's
the
normal
procedure.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
certainly
by
the
time
it
was
at
beacon
tow
service
at
the
time
of
the
search.
pardon
me?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
where
it
was
searched,
yes
sir;
where
they
found
the
brown
paper
we're
concerned
about.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
record
is
--
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that,
your
honor.
but
the
presumption
is
that
the
officers
of
the
state
took
it
as
it
were
their
duty
so
to
do.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'm
sure
he
didn't,
your
honor.
but
it
wasn't
his
car;
but
he
was
using
it;
it
had
been
loaned
to
him.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
now
let's
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
it
might
also
be
in
the
possession
of
the
state
under
some
other
theory,
for
example,
to
hold
it
as
evidence
in
the
case.
then
it
will
be
in
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state
and
could
be
examined
in
our
view
when
the
state
called
it
was
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
proper
to
do
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that
is
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh,
we
don't
say
the
state
owned
it,
your
honor.
we
say
it
was
in
lawful
custody.
the
state
wouldn't
own
it
until
such
time
as
the
narcotic
forfeiture
action
has
been
tried
and
concluded.
this
is
a
civil
action.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it's
in
lawful
custody
pending
determination
of
that
question.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
the
car
is
--
the
car
stays
in
the
custody
of
the
state
under
11611
of
the
health
and
safety
code
and
there's
no
provision
for
releasing
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
that
any
--
i
think
that's
substantially
it,
your
honor,
with
the
--
i
might
state
this
qualification
that
it
has
to
be
seized
under
such
circumstances
that
a
search
would
have
been
permissible
at
that
time.
and
in
a
narcotics
offense
where
the
narcotics
were
sold
from
the
car,
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
to
search
this
car
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
under
anybody's
view
of
the
law.
and
we
say
that
the
fact
it
was
searched
a
few
days
later,
it
having
come
into
the
lawful
custody
of
the
state
and
the
defendant
having
no
right
to
its
return
at
that
time,
then
the
search
is
not
unreasonable
within
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
thank
your
honor.
