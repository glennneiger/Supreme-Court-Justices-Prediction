well,
how
does
the

how
does
california
verbalize
this
rule;
that
there's
plenty
of
other
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction

that
there's
no
or
the

do
they

more

on

it
involves
a

of

justice

why

what's
the
differenced
between
the

this
case,
let's
assume
that
the
police
arrested
bank
robbers
that
are
coming
out
of
the
bank,
they
have
the
car
there
and
the
--
they
have
--
they
arrest
them

the

they
--
the
police
officer,
when
a
police
officer
drives
down

with
the

within
the
car
and
then
they
searched
it
down
at
the
station
in
the
custody
of
the

that's
a
different
situation
in
here,
i
suppose,
where
you
really
are
seizing
the
car
and
are
claiming
it
for
the
state.
justice

white
is
that
your
point?
justice
byron

white
had
the
state
already
actually
seized
it?
justice

white
and
stated
that
was
the

justice

white
well,
is
that
(voice

or
not?
justice
byron

white
is
there
authority
to
seize
before
the
civil
action
is

before
the
conclusion
of
the
seize?
justice
byron

what
does
the

say?
justice

what
if
they

seized
it?
what
the
police
did
as

the
owner
had
said,
say,
filed
an
action
for
a
(inaudible).
who
wants
the
car?
and
he
says
there's
no
action
filed.
you
can't
really
seize
my
car
until
they
conclude
the
guilty
of
--
until
the
seizure
proceeding
is
concluded
and
you've
proved
it.
now
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
byron

but
there
is

justice
byron

there
is

the

did
he?
justice

oh,
as
i
understand
it
the
--
what
invalidated
the
search
was
preston,
i

the
federal
law.
justice
byron

and
then

not
any

the

justice

if

let's
