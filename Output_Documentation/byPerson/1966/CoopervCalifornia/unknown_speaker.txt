unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
federal
constitution
reason
why
they
shouldn't?
they
don't
have
to
give
him
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
federal
--
supposing
the
california
courts
verbalized,
as
you
say,
they
do
in
fact
they
say,
"well,
in
applying
this
harmless
error
rule,
we,
the
state
appellate
court,
make
our
own
independent
review
of
the
evidence.
forget
what
the
jury
would
do
and
we
think
this
man
has
been
justly
convicted.
is
that
present
in
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
a
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
saying
--
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
the
question
as
to
whether
--
mapp
didn't
say
anything
about
whether
the
states
have
to
give
a
jury
trial
in
a
criminal
case
or
whether
they
could
--
the
appellate
court
could
review
evidence
without
regard
to
what
the
jury
might
have
done.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
(inaudible)
--
unknown
speaker
is
that
37.18
--
unknown
speaker
how
big
is
the
piece
of
brown
paper,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
went
into
evidence
--
went
in
the
long
--
in
the
other
brown
paper
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
in
the
same
envelope?
unknown
speaker
may
i
suggest
that's
there
also
the
(inaudible)
paper
bindles
are
referred
to
as
white?
unknown
speaker
so
that
what
we
had
down
before
us,
put
the
white
paper,
this
was
brown
paper
and
the
heroine
itself,
all
in
one
envelope?
unknown
speaker
two
pieces?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
so
i
gather
(inaudible)
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
did
they
hold
as
to
the
search
itself?
unknown
speaker
it
was
an
unreasonable
search?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
way
to
start
it
is
the
way
that
normally
the
way
they'd
start
proceedings
as
to
seize
the
car
and
then
do
something
about
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
federal
constitution
reason
why
they
shouldn't?
they
don't
have
to
give
