justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall,
that
was
not
a
court
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
the
court
prevailed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
hold
it
automatically,
did
it?
it
didn't
make
any
difference
how
minor
or
trivial
or
insignificant
the
harmless
error
to
the
--
error
was?
the
case
had
to
be
reversed,
it
could
never
be
held
as
harmless
error,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
it
your
position
that
any
or
in
it
and
--
in
any
one
trial,
there
is
one
error
made
and
it's
denying
the
constitutional
freedom
but
without
regard
of
weight,
significance,
comparison
to
all
other
evidence
or
anything
else,
that
the
case
has
to
be
reversed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
one
of
you
going
to
argue
on
the
basis
that
--
on
the
facts
--
i
hope
that
somebody
on
that
side
will
not
argue
or
get
beyond
that
extreme
to
you
and
argues
the
other
view.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that

justice

l.
black
i
don't
find
that

all
right,
i

l.
black
yes,
yes,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the

justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it
was
a
--
as
far
as
you
know
it
was
legally
in
possession
of
the
police?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
he
gathered
his
information
at
the
time
--
that
is
information
from
the
transcript
of
the
grand
jury.
they
do
get
a
transcript
(voice

--
justice

how
long
was
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
brown
paper
up
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
the
sole,
single
constitutional
error
on
which
the
petitioner
relied?
justice

l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
then
would
you
think
was
the
purpose
of
the
district
attorney
in
introducing
it?
i
saw
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
prove
guilt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
in
what
respect
would
it
bear
upon
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
these
actions?
justice

black
so
the
ones
that
are
in
evidence?
justice

l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice

of

a

kind
or
was
it
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
showing
it
was
the
same
kind
of
paper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
introduce
it
for
but
wasn't
the
same
kind
or
if
he
didn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
did
--
if
he
didn't
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
was
the
same
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
he
wouldn't
mislead
the
jury
or
the
judge
by
trying
to
introduce
some
paper
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
the
purpose
of
connecting,
it
wasn't
the
same
kind
in
his
opinion,
would
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
objection
first
come
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
questioned
car
not
in
the
lawful
custody
yet?
justice

black
well
had
the
state
--
justice

black
did
they
start
the
proceeding?
justice
hugo

black
where
was
it?
where
was
the
car?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice

black
when
did
the
state
--
where
was
it
supposed
to
be
placed
where
--
(inaudible)
the

have?
justice

black
is
that
where
it
was
searched?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
took
it
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'll
--
you
sanctioned
(inaudible)
and
that
point
is
that
(inaudible)
has
been
still
in
the
possession
of
the

at

their
right
to

while
here,
this
was
in

possession
of
the
state
under
a
claim
and
then
used
by
an
unlawful
purposed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
be
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
that
would
be
a
different
--
the
mere
fact
that
you
wanted
to
use
it
for
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
it
seems
to
me
quite
a
difference
from
the
--
if
you
were
claiming
if
it's
the
state
only
that
the
impounding
of
--
forfeited
vehicle.
justice

black
but
there's
no
pending
--
as
a
part
of
the

claim
to
forfeit?
justice

does
the

there
provide

prevail
for

lawful
