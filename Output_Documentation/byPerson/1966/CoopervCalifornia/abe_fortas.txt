suppose
the
position
might
be
that
there
might
be
something
so
trivial
that
they
don't
amount
to
violations
of
the
constitution.
for
example,
suppose
that
the
--
something
were
introduced
in
evidence
that
no
relationship
to
the
case
whatever
but
somehow
got
into
evidence
but
it
turned
out
that
it
was
illegally
seized.
and
on
theory,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution
but
it
would
be
so
remote
from
the
major
thrust
of
the
case
that
it
would
be
pretty
definite
to
say
that
a
conviction
ought
to
be
set
aside
on
that
ground
by
the
two
ways
of
praising
it
perhaps,
one
is
at
--
in
a
particular
case
then
(inaudible)
violation
of
the
constitution
and
the
other
that
it's
harmless
error?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
would
you
take
the
--
you
really
mean
that
anything
--
that
if
something
happens
in
a
case
that's
in
violation
of
constitutional
no
matter
how
remote
or
unimportant
or
insignificant
or
trivial,
that
automatically
it
can
have
a
conviction?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
really
is
a
kitchen
sink
position?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
traynor,
would
you
really
ask
us
to
go
beyond
kotteakos,
aren't
you?
justice

fortas
it
does
--
justice
abe

as
i
read

go
ahead
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
it
that
it's
more
conservative
than
your
position
in
terms
of
a
fair
intendment
of
the
court's
opinion.

the
pondering
all
that
happened
without
stripping
the
erroneous
action
involved
that
the
judgment
was
not

it's

now
there
are
a

knots

there.
but
in
substance,
what
he
is
saying,
is
that
you've
got
to
be
sure
and
this
is
on
764,
you
must
be
sure
that
the
error
did
not
influence
the
jury
or
it
had
but
a
very
slight
effect.
that
it's
not
the
absolute

what
you
are
