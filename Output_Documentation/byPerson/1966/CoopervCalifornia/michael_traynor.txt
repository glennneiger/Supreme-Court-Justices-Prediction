mr.
michael
traynor
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
because
of
a
vital
piece
of
grocery
bag
that
was
unconstitutionally
seized
from
the
defendant
and
unconstitutionally
used
against
him
at
his
trial.
it
presents
the
issues
whether
if
it
is
ever
only
harmless
to
violate
the
united
states
constitution
and
whether
in
fact
it
was
harmless
here.
defendant
cooper
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
for
selling
two
bindles
of
heroine
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
brown
paper
bag
to
a
police
informer
who
is
both
unreliable
and
untrustworthy.
at
the
trial,
the
prosecution
placed
this
unconstitutionally
seized
piece
of
brown
paper
in
the
same
exhibit
as
the
two
bindles
of
heroine
and
the
other
piece
of
brown
paper
within
which
they
have
been
wrapped.
he
presented
it
before
to
the
grand
jury.
the
piece
of
paper
was
obtained
after
the
police
had
set
up
this
controlled
narcotic
buy.
and
on
the
appeal
of
this
case,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
argued
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
that
this
unconstitutional
evidence
was
highly
relevant.
petitioner
was
hurt
in
the
trial
court
by
the
use
of
this
evidence.
he
was
hurt
also
in
the
appellate
court
by
the
notion
that
violation
of
the
constitution
can
be
dismissed
as
harmless.
i
think
a
fair
premise
from
which
to
start
in
this
case
is
that
prosecutors
act
rationally.
the
--
when
they
bring
a
prosecution
against
a
man,
they
don't
bring
it
if
they
believe
he's
innocent,
they
bring
it
because
they
believe
he's
guilty
and
that
he'd
be
--
and
that
he
deserves
a
conviction.
and
in
introducing
the
evidence
in
that
case,
they've
act
on
the
assumption
that
that
evidence
will
hurt
him.
there
would
be
no
reason
for
a
prosecutor
to
bring
in
evidence
in
a
case
unless
he
felt
that
it
would
contribute
to
the
conviction
of
a
man
that
he
assumed
to
be
guilty.
why
should
an
appellate
court
speculate
that
this
decision
of
the
prosecutor
was
harmless
when
the
man's
constitutional
rights
were
violated
not
only
by
the
seizure
of
the
evidence
but
by
the
use
of
that
evidence
at
trial.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
that
issue
is
not
raised
in
a
district
court
of
appeals
so
i
don't
believe
it
is
an
issue
here,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
piece
of
marijuana
was
unconstitutionally
obtained.
i
think
under
the
same
premises
but
it
is
not
issue
on
this
--
before
this
court.
mr.
michael
traynor
there
was
an
objection
made
but
it
was
not
raised
in
the
appellate
court
and
the
objection
in
the
trial
court
was
not
made
on
search
and
seizure
grounds.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
--
i
might
point
out
the
trial
judge
didn't
think
it
was
a
much
weight.
we're
right
to
argue
this
appeal
again
and
i
did
argue
it
in
the
court
below;
i
would
have
probably
raised
that
issue.
but
i
don't
--
i
can't
fairly
say
that
that's
it
before
the
court
now.
mr.
michael
traynor
this
court
--
the
petitioner
here
relies
on
the
rule
of
the
coerced
confession
cases
and
the
many
other
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
in
which
the
violation
of
the
constitution
has
not
been
considered
harmless.
for
thirty
years
since
brown
against
mississippi,
this
court
and
the
federal
court
in
habeas
court
proceedings
with
judiciary
records
of
the
state
courts
and
convictions
obtained
on
the
basis
of
coerced
confessions.
here
and
in
miranda,
this
approach
is
totality
of
circumstances
approach
was
rejected.
the
approach
that
the
respondent
asks
this
court
to
take
here
would
impose
an
even
more
unmanageable
burden
upon
the
federal
courts
and
this
court
on
reviewing
the
facts
in
the
records
in
each
case.
as
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
argued
in
the
other
case,
what
this
rule
requires
is
an
examination
of
the
entire
record
and
the
entire
case
and
the
evidence
in
each
case.
in
the
coerced
confession
cases,
the
issue
and
the
burden
of
review
was
limited
to
the
very
small
issue
whether
the
confession
obtained
was
voluntary.
here,
the
burden
of
review
would
be
one
of
reviewing
the
entire
record.
in
the
coerced
confession
cases,
the
totality
of
circumstances
approach
which
has
now
been
rejected,
there
was
on
some
cases,
a
legitimate
purpose
for
going
in
and
for
the
courts
undertaking
this
burden,
mainly,
the
purpose
of
helping
the
prosecution
if
the
confession
was
voluntary,
it
often
was
a
crucial
piece
of
evidence
and
the
man
would
--
and
the
man's
conviction
would
be
sustained.
but
here
by
hypothesis
of
the
prosecution,
the
evidence
has
no
value.
they
are
not
seeking
the
burden
--
seeking
the
court
to
review
the
facts
of
cases
to
obtain
utility
of
otherwise
valid
evidence
because
by
their
own
hypothesis,
the
evidence
is
irrelevant.
the
state's
arguments
in
its
brief
that
the
state
courts
can
be
expected
to
honor
the
fourth
amendment
is
contradicted
i
think
by
its
irresponsible
argument
that
an
application
of
a
harmless
error
doctrine
is
a
question
of
state
law
and
not
federal
and
cannot
be
reviewed
by
this
court
or
by
the
state
court
or
by
the
federal
court.
it
is
also
contradicted
by
their
attempt
to
trivialize
the
preston
case.
the
preston
case
is
a
crux
of
this
case.
there
was
violation
of
search
and
seizure
of
evidence
from
an
impounded
car
and
the
state
concedes
in
its
brief
that
the
vehicle
forfeiture
statute
in
the
state
of
california
did
not
itself
authorize
the
search.
it
attempts
to
argue
that
the
vehicle
was
in
custody
under
that
statute
and
that
therefore
the
search
was
legal.
these
same
facts
were
present
in
the
preston
case.
the
state's
argument
is
nothing
more
than
attempt
to
evade
and
trivialize
the
preston
rule.
mr.
michael
traynor
your
honor
in
my
brief
i've
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
this
court
where
a
violation
of
the
constitution
has
been
ruled
to
be
--
to
require
reversal,
that
rule
of
reversal.
mr.
michael
traynor
i
haven't
found
--
you
mean
this
is
a
--
mr.
michael
traynor
i
have
not
found
a
case
in
this
court
construing
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
to
permit
the
dismissing
the
violations
of
the
united
states
constitution
as
harmless.
in
my
review
of
the
history
of
that
legislation,
some
of
which
is
reproduced
in
appendix
b
to
my
brief
suggests
that
the
harmless
error
federal
statute
was
never
intended
to
apply
to
violations
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
history
is
also
reviewed
in
a
very
helpful
case
by
justice
rutledge
in
the
kotteakos
case
and
the
conclusion
there
is
that
the
harmless
error
statute
of
congress
was
intended
to
apply
to
breaches
of
etiquette
or
breaches
of
minor
rules
of
evidence
in
the
trial
courts
and
not
to
violations
of
the
united
states
constitution
or
to
violations
of
important
statutes.
there
was
a
statute
--
mr.
michael
traynor
excuse
me,
your
honor,
that
was
--
mr.
michael
traynor
the
kotteakos
case?
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
this
kotteakos
against
the
united
states
in
which
this
court
reviewed
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule.
it
involved
the
question
of
conspiracy
in
general
and
special
charges
and
the
error
there
was
ruled
on
the
facts
of
that
case
to
be
harmful
and
to
require
reversal.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
i'm
not
sure
it
held
that;
i
think
on
the
--
in
the
kotteakos
case,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
court
did
review
and
tried
to
make
a
careful
review
of
the
record.
and
there
was
a
dissent
on
that
case
by
justice
douglas
on
the
ground
that
his
review
of
the
record,
he
felt
there
was
--
it
was
harmless.
i
believe
the
court
in
the
kotteakos
case
did
review
the
entire
proceeding
but
contrast
to
that
to
a
case
in
language
they
used
with
a
violation
they've
--
they
left
aside
a
question
of
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
norm
or
an
important
statute.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
that
is
my
position
and
that
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
michael
traynor
well,
i'd
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
facts
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
michael
traynor
mr.
justice
fortas,
let
me,
attempt
to
answer
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
the
result
to
which
my
argument
leads
and
i
would
argue
for
that
case
and
i've
so
argued
in
my
brief.
and
let
me
answer,
if
i
may,
in
two
respects,
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
--
that
type
of
case,
i
think
will
be
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
because
the
rule
ordinarily
will
be
that
the
prosecution's
purpose
will
be
to
use
evidence
that
will
be
harmful.
but
suppose
for
example,
that
instead
of
the
brown
piece
of
paper
bag
in
this
case
that
closely
resembled
the
paper
in
which
the
bindles
had
been
wrapped;
that
the
police,
a
week
after
the
man's
arrest
and
without
a
warrant
and
not
incident
to
the
arrest,
and
without
any
danger
or
other
justification
for
a
search
had
gone
to
the
man's
house
and
taken
the
kitchen
sink.
that
even
in
such
a
case,
i
would
contend
that
the
constitution
would
require
a
reversal.
that
type
of
example,
if
such
a
thing
were
allowed
--
mr.
michael
traynor
it
would
be,
yes,
your
honor,
would
be.
the
very
fact
--
the
police
might
be
encouraged
to
do
that,
to
ransack
a
man's
home
to
obtain
such
evidence.
and
the
very
fact
that
the
prosecutor
thought
it
could
get
away
with
such
frivolous
evidence
would
reveal
to
me
great
reason
for
requiring
a
reversal
in
that
case.
and
i
think
it
is
your
honor
(voice
overlap)
the
exception
that
does
prove
the
rule.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
your
honor
i
--
the
primary
and
first
argument
in
my
brief
was
that
we
should
win
this
case
on
the
fact.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
an
application
of
that
rule
denied
due
process
to
the
defendant
in
this
case.
the
facts
and
the
reasons
why
we
argue
prejudice
in
this
case
are
that
this
was
an
extremely
weak
circumstantial
case
against
the
defendant.
if
the
prosecutor
had
thought
that
the
observations
of
the
police
of
this
transaction
between
their
unreliable
informer
and
the
suspect
were
sufficient,
why
did
they
go
out
a
week
after
the
arrest
to
search
for
more
evidence
and
to
ransack
the
car
and
obtain
it?
this
piece
of
evidence
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
it
was
placed
in
the
same
exhibit
as
the
two
bindles
of
heroine
and
the
other
piece
of
smaller
brown
paper
that
the
defendant
was
charged
for
selling.
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
place
it
in
the
same
exhibit
had
not
the
prosecutor
intended
the
court
to
draw
the
inference
that
the
two
pieces
of
brown
paper,
one
that
wrapped
the
bindles
of
heroine
and
one
that
had
been
unconstitutionally
seized,
came
from
the
same
source,
mainly
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
traynor
the
--
mr.
michael
traynor
they
have
articulated
the
formulation,
mr.
justice
white
that
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
defendant
might
have
achieved
a
more
favorable
result.
now
by
more
favorable
result
can
only
mean
an
acquittal
or
perhaps
a
lower
determination,
for
example,
in
a
murder
case.
mr.
michael
traynor
if
the
evidence
have
not
been
admitted.
more
favorable
to
me
means
an
acquittal,
the
man
is
innocent
or
perhaps,
in
a
murder
case,
a
conviction
on
a
lower
count,
for
example,
manslaughter
instead
of
first
degree
murder
--
mr.
michael
traynor
and
perhaps
punishment
also,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
michael
traynor
in
effect
your
honor,
i
think
that's
right.
it
asks
the
appellate
courts
to
sit
in
the
jury
box
and
look
at
the
case.
mr.
michael
traynor
that
is
what
they
say,
i
think,
your
honor;
the
latter.
what
they
do
in
fact,
i
think
a
fair
inference
from
some
of
the
cases
that
i've
listed
in
my
brief,
in
the
appendix
is
to
convince
themselves
that
the
man
is
guilty.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
this
would
apply
in
court
trial
or
jury
trial.
mr.
michael
traynor
and
the
--
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
i
do.i
think
it
--
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
it's
a
very
important
federal
question,
your
honor.
mapp
against
ohio
puts
some
teeth
into
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
application
kind
of
this
kind
of
rule
would
take
the
bite
out
of
this.
the
--
and
the
question
whether
a
violation
of
the
constitution
is
harmless
presents
a
very
important
federal
question
and
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
mapp
case
does
not
control
this
case.
it
established
the
exclusionary
rule
for
the
state
courts.
but
i'm
arguing
here
that
the
necessary
implementation
and
ingredient
requirement
of
that
rule
is
that
violations
of
it
be
accompanied
by
a
reversal
otherwise
it's
meaningless.
and
that
it
does
present
a
very
important
federal
question.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
the
kotteakos
case
--
mr.
michael
traynor
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
traynor
the
kotteakos
case
reserved
the
question
as
i
read
the
case
of
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
norm
or
an
important
statute.
it
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
and
i
think
they've
--
they
reserved
the
question
of
a
violation
of
whether
it
should
be
an
absolute
rule.
the
one
--
other
perhaps
formulation
of
that
language
would
be
whether
there's
--
whether
a
sensible
and
honest
judge
or
jury
could've
honestly
entertained
the
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
man's
guilt
or
innocence
below.
as
if
there
was
a
chance
to
that
then
he
should
obtain
a
reversal
of
his
conviction.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
that's
right,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
have
saved
a
little
time
for
rebuttal
and
i
would
--
i've
presented
a
confrontation
question
in
the
brief
and
i
rest
on
that.
i
maintain
it
and
do
not
abandon
it.
and
in
conclusion,
would
like
to
say
that
a
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution
isn't
harmless.
it's
not
a
legal
technicality.
it
can't
dismissed
into
something
lightly
and
trivial.
and
in
fact,
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
caused
substantial
harm
by
the
violations
of
the
constitution
and
the
notion
that
the
violation
of
it
could
be
washed
away
as
harmless.
and
without
reason,
we
respectfully
submit
your
honors
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
traynor
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
portion
of
the
story
of
this
case
that
was
related
to
you
by
the
attorney
general
was
fairly
stated
but
it's
not
the
complete
story
in
this
case.
this
case
is
a
very
weak
factual
case.
it
began
when
the
federal
agents
started
the
eavesdropping
on
the
defendant's
home
and
turned
up
no
evidence
of
any
sales
of
narcotics.
the
next
step
the
police
took
in
this
case
was
to
arrest
at
dawn
an
unreliable
and
untrustworthy
informer
and
subject
him
to
several
hours
of
interrogation.
at
the
conclusion
of
which,
he
agreed
to
act
for
the
police
as
a
participating
informer
and
what
is
commonly
as
a
police-controlled
narcotics
buying.
the
two
officers
who
were
stationed
outside
the
defendant's
residence
only
said
that
he
took
the
description
of
the
defendant,
that
the
man
who
came
out
of
the
house.
one
of
those
officers
said
the
man
limped.
the
other
officer
said
he'd
walked
fairly
normally.
there
was
a
discrepancy
at
the
outset
in
their
physical
identification.
the
mark
money
that
was
given
to
the
informer
as
one
of
the
ingredients
of
trying
to
tie
the
sale
to
this
defendant
was
never
found.
the
other
ingredient
of
trying
--
that
the
officers
are
trying
to
tie
this
sale
to
the
defendant
was
to
have
him
supervise
and
constantly
observe
the
transaction.
this
attempt
failed.
agent
alameda,
who
was
stationed
down
at
the
market,
lost
sight
of
the
informer
and
the
suspect
during
the
crucial
two
to
three
minutes
of
transaction
occurred.
the
two
other
officers
were
stationed
at
a
point
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away.
their
view
was
obstructed
in
part
by
a
passing
and
parked
cars
and
they
also
conflicted
on
the
very
important
part
of
their
testimony.
one
of
them
placed
the
informer
inside
the
car
on
the
right
hand
side.
the
other
one
placed
the
informer
had
to
be
standing
outside
the
car
at
the
driver's
side.
mrs.
galley
(ph),
who
is
the
aunt
of
defendant
that
was
home,
they've
tried
to
place
him
in
residence
with
regard
to
the
phone
call
on
re-direct
examination,
was
asked
about
the
phone
call.
she
said,
"i've
answered
the
phone
and
i've
told
him
that
only
the
girls
that
would
be
calling
him."
in
this
case,
we
had
a
testimony
that
there
was
a
man
calling
and
not
girls.
the
participating
unreliable
untrustworthy
informer
was
never
produced
as
a
witness
at
this
trial.
he
was
never
in
the
case
although
he
was
the
really
most
important
salient
witness
against
the
defendant.
the
defendant
took
the
stand
and
testified
in
his
own
behalf
and
contradicted
the
testimony
of
these
police
officers.
this
was
such
a
weak
case
that
the
prosecutor
must
have
thought
and
did
think
that
every
piece
of
paper,
every
scarp
of
evidence
including
a
scrap
of
paper
would
be
necessary
to
contribute
to
a
conviction
and
so
it
did.
it
is
for
this
reason
in
the
constant
references
to
the
attempt
of
the
prosecutor
to
establish
the
connection
between
brown
paper,
the
swallowing
of
the
piece
of
brown
paper
package
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
the
defendant's
use
of
the
brown
paper
in
testimony
during
his
unconstitutional
interrogation
at
the
police
station
and
the
placement
and
finally
and
most
importantly
the
placement
of
this
illegal
piece
of
paper
in
the
very
same
exhibit
as
the
subject
of
the
crime
for
which
the
man
was
charged.
mr.
michael
traynor
i
think
there's
two
parts
to
that
answer,
mr.
justice
stewart.
one
is
as
of
a
matter
of
state
law
they
construed
the
vehicle
forfeiture
statute
not
to
authorize
the
kind
of
search
that
was
made
here.
without
that
kind
of
authority,
this
case
became
for
the
state
--
district
court
of
appeal
the
same
kind
of
case
as
the
preston
case.
simply,
a
vehicle
in
lawful
custody,
and
they
said
it
was
in
lawful
custody.
mr.
michael
traynor
in
lawful
custody
and
they
said
so
in
their
opinion.
and
that
being
in
lawful
custody
was
simply
a
preston
case
and
was
controlled
by
it.
mr.
michael
traynor
lawful
custody
of
the
police,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
michael
traynor
i
think
that's
right.
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here,
your
honor,
if
it
were
not
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor
and
they
relied
on
both
the
preston
case
and
the
case
in
california
called
the
burke
case
which
followed
preston
which
involved
the
obtaining
of
a
car
under
the
vehicle
code
when
a
man's
arrested
on
the
highway
obtaining
and
putting
him
on
custody.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
my
reading
of
the
burke
case,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
it
followed
preston
and
relied
on
it
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
no,
this
is
--
this
case
is
here
because
it
was
a
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
michael
traynor
under
the
preston
--
mr.
michael
traynor
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
a
would
be
a
very
difficult
argument
to
make
because
on
the
record
in
the
preston
case,
the
--
one
of
the
arguments
made
was
that
the
police
had
caused
to
believe
that
the
car
was
in
fact
stolen
and
that
it
was
in
lawful
custody
of
the
police
because
it
was
stolen.
and
in
fact,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
--
mr.
michael
traynor
i'm
not
so
sure
that
would
be
the
correct
answer,
your
honor.
this
--
the
district
court
of
appeal,
if
that
were
the
case,
i
think
properly
relied
on
preston
even
assuming
as
--
even
assuming
preston
was
not
controlling.
preston
--
i
don't
think
should
be
read
as
simply
establishing
the
outer
limits
otherwise,
to
read
it
otherwise
would
discourage
the
state
and
federal
courts
from
taking
the
decision
to
this
court
and
following
them
and
applying
them
in
the
cases
where
they
should
be
controlled.
the
district
court
of
appeal
properly,
i
think,
interpreted
the
preston
case
to
apply
to
this.
we
have
the
same
element
of
lawful
custody
in
both
cases.
the
state's
reliance
on
the
ninth
circuit
federal
court
case
under
the
narcotics
statutes
is
a
case
that
didn't
even
bother
to
cite
the
preston
case
even
though
it
was
decided
after
it.
the
--
there's
really
no
justification
for
distinguishing
the
preston
case
here.
what
the
state
is
really
attempting
to
do
is
to
overrule
the
preston
case
or
to
trivialize
it
by
exceptions
that
there
are
no
available
exceptions
in
this
case.
the
important
point
i
wanted
to
make
coming
back
is
that
this
was
an
extremely
weak
case
against
the
defendant.
every
piece
--
every
scrap
of
paper
was
necessary
and
it
was
used
and
it
hurt
and
it
hurt
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court
and
it
hurt
him
in
the
appellate
court.
and
for
that
reason
his
conviction
was
unconstitutionally
obtained
and
for
that
reason
also
it
must
be
reversed
respectfully.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
traynor
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
because
of
a
vital
piece
of
grocery
bag
that
was
unconstitutionally
seized
from
the
defendant
and
unconstitutionally
used
against
him
at
his
trial.
it
presents
the
issues
whether
if
it
is
ever
only
harmless
to
violate
the
united
states
constitution
and
whether
in
fact
it
was
harmless
here.
defendant
cooper
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
for
selling
two
bindles
of
heroine
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
brown
paper
bag
to
a
police
informer
who
is
both
unreliable
and
untrustworthy.
at
the
trial,
the
prosecution
placed
this
unconstitutionally
seized
piece
of
brown
paper
in
the
same
exhibit
as
the
two
bindles
of
heroine
and
the
other
piece
of
brown
paper
within
which
they
have
been
wrapped.
he
presented
it
before
to
the
grand
jury.
the
piece
of
paper
was
obtained
after
the
police
had
set
up
this
controlled
narcotic
buy.
and
on
the
appeal
of
this
case,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
argued
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
that
this
unconstitutional
evidence
was
highly
relevant.
petitioner
was
hurt
in
the
trial
court
by
the
use
of
this
evidence.
he
was
hurt
also
in
the
appellate
court
by
the
notion
that
violation
of
the
constitution
can
be
dismissed
as
harmless.
i
think
a
fair
premise
from
which
to
start
in
this
case
is
that
prosecutors
act
rationally.
the
--
when
they
bring
a
prosecution
against
a
man,
they
don't
bring
it
if
they
believe
he's
innocent,
they
bring
it
because
they
believe
he's
guilty
and
that
he'd
be
--
and
that
he
deserves
a
conviction.
and
in
introducing
the
evidence
in
that
case,
they've
act
on
the
assumption
that
that
evidence
will
hurt
him.
there
would
be
no
reason
for
a
prosecutor
to
bring
in
evidence
in
a
case
unless
he
felt
that
it
would
contribute
to
the
conviction
of
a
man
that
he
assumed
to
be
guilty.
why
should
an
appellate
court
speculate
that
this
decision
of
the
prosecutor
was
harmless
when
the
man's
constitutional
rights
were
violated
not
only
by
the
seizure
of
the
evidence
but
by
the
use
of
that
evidence
at
trial.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
that
issue
is
not
raised
in
a
district
court
of
appeals
so
i
don't
believe
it
is
an
issue
here,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
that
piece
of
marijuana
was
unconstitutionally
obtained.
i
think
under
the
same
premises
but
it
is
not
issue
on
this
--
before
this
court.
mr.
michael
traynor
there
was
an
objection
made
but
it
was
not
raised
in
the
appellate
court
and
the
objection
in
the
trial
court
was
not
made
on
search
and
seizure
grounds.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
--
i
might
point
out
the
trial
judge
didn't
think
it
was
a
much
weight.
we're
right
to
argue
this
appeal
again
and
i
did
argue
it
in
the
court
below;
i
would
have
probably
raised
that
issue.
but
i
don't
--
i
can't
fairly
say
that
that's
it
before
the
court
now.
mr.
michael
traynor
this
court
--
the
petitioner
here
relies
on
the
rule
of
the
coerced
confession
cases
and
the
many
other
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
in
which
the
violation
of
the
constitution
has
not
been
considered
harmless.
for
thirty
years
since
brown
against
mississippi,
this
court
and
the
federal
court
in
habeas
court
proceedings
with
judiciary
records
of
the
state
courts
and
convictions
obtained
on
the
basis
of
coerced
confessions.
here
and
in
miranda,
this
approach
is
totality
of
circumstances
approach
was
rejected.
the
approach
that
the
respondent
asks
this
court
to
take
here
would
impose
an
even
more
unmanageable
burden
upon
the
federal
courts
and
this
court
on
reviewing
the
facts
in
the
records
in
each
case.
as
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
argued
in
the
other
case,
what
this
rule
requires
is
an
examination
of
the
entire
record
and
the
entire
case
and
the
evidence
in
each
case.
in
the
coerced
confession
cases,
the
issue
and
the
burden
of
review
was
limited
to
the
very
small
issue
whether
the
confession
obtained
was
voluntary.
here,
the
burden
of
review
would
be
one
of
reviewing
the
entire
record.
in
the
coerced
confession
cases,
the
totality
of
circumstances
approach
which
has
now
been
rejected,
there
was
on
some
cases,
a
legitimate
purpose
for
going
in
and
for
the
courts
undertaking
this
burden,
mainly,
the
purpose
of
helping
the
prosecution
if
the
confession
was
voluntary,
it
often
was
a
crucial
piece
of
evidence
and
the
man
would
--
and
the
man's
conviction
would
be
sustained.
but
here
by
hypothesis
of
the
prosecution,
the
evidence
has
no
value.
they
are
not
seeking
the
burden
--
seeking
the
court
to
review
the
facts
of
cases
to
obtain
utility
of
otherwise
valid
evidence
because
by
their
own
hypothesis,
the
evidence
is
irrelevant.
the
state's
arguments
in
its
brief
that
the
state
courts
can
be
expected
to
honor
the
fourth
amendment
is
contradicted
i
think
by
its
irresponsible
argument
that
an
application
of
a
harmless
error
doctrine
is
a
question
of
state
law
and
not
federal
and
cannot
be
reviewed
by
this
court
or
by
the
state
court
or
by
the
federal
court.
it
is
also
contradicted
by
their
attempt
to
trivialize
the
preston
case.
the
preston
case
is
a
crux
of
this
case.
there
was
violation
of
search
and
seizure
of
evidence
from
an
impounded
car
and
the
state
concedes
in
its
brief
that
the
vehicle
forfeiture
statute
in
the
state
of
california
did
not
itself
authorize
the
search.
it
attempts
to
argue
that
the
vehicle
was
in
custody
under
that
statute
and
that
therefore
the
search
was
legal.
these
same
facts
were
present
in
the
preston
case.
the
state's
argument
is
nothing
more
than
attempt
to
evade
and
trivialize
the
preston
rule.
mr.
michael
traynor
your
honor
in
my
brief
i've
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
this
court
where
a
violation
of
the
constitution
has
been
ruled
to
be
--
to
require
reversal,
that
rule
of
reversal.
mr.
michael
traynor
i
haven't
found
--
you
mean
this
is
a
--
mr.
michael
traynor
i
have
not
found
a
case
in
this
court
construing
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
to
permit
the
dismissing
the
violations
of
the
united
states
constitution
as
harmless.
in
my
review
of
the
history
of
that
legislation,
some
of
which
is
reproduced
in
appendix
b
to
my
brief
suggests
that
the
harmless
error
federal
statute
was
never
intended
to
apply
to
violations
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
history
is
also
reviewed
in
a
very
helpful
case
by
justice
rutledge
in
the
kotteakos
case
and
the
conclusion
there
is
that
the
harmless
error
statute
of
congress
was
intended
to
apply
to
breaches
of
etiquette
or
breaches
of
minor
rules
of
evidence
in
the
trial
courts
and
not
to
violations
of
the
united
states
constitution
or
to
violations
of
important
statutes.
there
was
a
statute
--
mr.
michael
traynor
excuse
me,
your
honor,
that
was
--
mr.
michael
traynor
the
kotteakos
case?
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
this
kotteakos
against
the
united
states
in
which
this
court
reviewed
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule.
it
involved
the
question
of
conspiracy
in
general
and
special
charges
and
the
error
there
was
ruled
on
the
facts
of
that
case
to
be
harmful
and
to
require
reversal.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
i'm
not
sure
it
held
that;
i
think
on
the
--
in
the
kotteakos
case,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
court
did
review
and
tried
to
make
a
careful
review
of
the
record.
and
there
was
a
dissent
on
that
case
by
justice
douglas
on
the
ground
that
his
review
of
the
record,
he
felt
there
was
--
it
was
harmless.
i
believe
the
court
in
the
kotteakos
case
did
review
the
entire
proceeding
but
contrast
to
that
to
a
case
in
language
they
used
with
a
violation
they've
--
they
left
aside
a
question
of
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
norm
or
an
important
statute.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
that
is
my
position
and
that
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
michael
traynor
well,
i'd
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
facts
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
michael
traynor
mr.
justice
fortas,
let
me,
attempt
to
answer
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
the
result
to
which
my
argument
leads
and
i
would
argue
for
that
case
and
i've
so
argued
in
my
brief.
and
let
me
answer,
if
i
may,
in
two
respects,
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
--
that
type
of
case,
i
think
will
be
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
because
the
rule
ordinarily
will
be
that
the
prosecution's
purpose
will
be
to
use
evidence
that
will
be
harmful.
but
suppose
for
example,
that
instead
of
the
brown
piece
of
paper
bag
in
this
case
that
closely
resembled
the
paper
in
which
the
bindles
had
been
wrapped;
that
the
police,
a
week
after
the
man's
arrest
and
without
a
warrant
and
not
incident
to
the
arrest,
and
without
any
danger
or
other
justification
for
a
search
had
gone
to
the
man's
house
and
taken
the
kitchen
sink.
that
even
in
such
a
case,
i
would
contend
that
the
constitution
would
require
a
reversal.
that
type
of
example,
if
such
a
thing
were
allowed
--
mr.
michael
traynor
it
would
be,
yes,
your
honor,
would
be.
the
very
fact
--
the
police
might
be
encouraged
to
do
that,
to
ransack
a
man's
home
to
obtain
such
evidence.
and
the
very
fact
that
the
prosecutor
thought
it
could
get
away
with
such
frivolous
evidence
would
reveal
to
me
great
reason
for
requiring
a
reversal
in
that
case.
and
i
think
it
is
your
honor
(voice
overlap)
the
exception
that
does
prove
the
rule.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
your
honor
i
--
the
primary
and
first
argument
in
my
brief
was
that
we
should
win
this
case
on
the
fact.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
an
application
of
that
rule
denied
due
process
to
the
defendant
in
this
case.
the
facts
and
the
reasons
why
we
argue
prejudice
in
this
case
are
that
this
was
an
extremely
weak
circumstantial
case
against
the
defendant.
if
the
prosecutor
had
thought
that
the
observations
of
the
police
of
this
transaction
between
their
unreliable
informer
and
the
suspect
were
sufficient,
why
did
they
go
out
a
week
after
the
arrest
to
search
for
more
evidence
and
to
ransack
the
car
and
obtain
it?
this
piece
of
evidence
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
it
was
placed
in
the
same
exhibit
as
the
two
bindles
of
heroine
and
the
other
piece
of
smaller
brown
paper
that
the
defendant
was
charged
for
selling.
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
place
it
in
the
same
exhibit
had
not
the
prosecutor
intended
the
court
to
draw
the
inference
that
the
two
pieces
of
brown
paper,
one
that
wrapped
the
bindles
of
heroine
and
one
that
had
been
unconstitutionally
seized,
came
from
the
same
source,
mainly
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
traynor
the
--
mr.
michael
traynor
they
have
articulated
the
formulation,
mr.
justice
white
that
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
defendant
might
have
achieved
a
more
favorable
result.
now
by
more
favorable
result
can
only
mean
an
acquittal
or
perhaps
a
lower
determination,
for
example,
in
a
murder
case.
mr.
michael
traynor
if
the
evidence
have
not
been
admitted.
more
favorable
to
me
means
an
acquittal,
the
man
is
innocent
or
perhaps,
in
a
murder
case,
a
conviction
on
a
lower
count,
for
example,
manslaughter
instead
of
first
degree
murder
--
mr.
michael
traynor
and
perhaps
punishment
also,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
michael
traynor
in
effect
your
honor,
i
think
that's
right.
it
asks
the
appellate
courts
to
sit
in
the
jury
box
and
look
at
the
case.
mr.
michael
traynor
that
is
what
they
say,
i
think,
your
honor;
the
latter.
what
they
do
in
fact,
i
think
a
fair
inference
from
some
of
the
cases
that
i've
listed
in
my
brief,
in
the
appendix
is
to
convince
themselves
that
the
man
is
guilty.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
this
would
apply
in
court
trial
or
jury
trial.
mr.
michael
traynor
and
the
--
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
i
do.i
think
it
--
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
it's
a
very
important
federal
question,
your
honor.
mapp
against
ohio
puts
some
teeth
into
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
application
kind
of
this
kind
of
rule
would
take
the
bite
out
of
this.
the
--
and
the
question
whether
a
violation
of
the
constitution
is
harmless
presents
a
very
important
federal
question
and
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
mapp
case
does
not
control
this
case.
it
established
the
exclusionary
rule
for
the
state
courts.
but
i'm
arguing
here
that
the
necessary
implementation
and
ingredient
requirement
of
that
rule
is
that
violations
of
it
be
accompanied
by
a
reversal
otherwise
it's
meaningless.
and
that
it
does
present
a
very
important
federal
question.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
the
kotteakos
case
--
mr.
michael
traynor
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
traynor
the
kotteakos
case
reserved
the
question
as
i
read
the
case
of
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
norm
or
an
important
statute.
it
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
and
i
think
they've
--
they
reserved
the
question
of
a
violation
of
whether
it
should
be
an
absolute
rule.
the
one
--
other
perhaps
formulation
of
that
language
would
be
whether
there's
--
whether
a
sensible
and
honest
judge
or
jury
could've
honestly
entertained
the
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
man's
guilt
or
innocence
below.
as
if
there
was
a
chance
to
that
then
he
should
obtain
a
reversal
of
his
conviction.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
that's
right,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
have
saved
a
little
time
for
rebuttal
and
i
would
--
i've
presented
a
confrontation
question
in
the
brief
and
i
rest
on
that.
i
maintain
it
and
do
not
abandon
it.
and
in
conclusion,
would
like
to
say
that
a
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution
isn't
harmless.
it's
not
a
legal
technicality.
it
can't
dismissed
into
something
lightly
and
trivial.
and
in
fact,
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
caused
substantial
harm
by
the
violations
of
the
constitution
and
the
notion
that
the
violation
of
it
could
be
washed
away
as
harmless.
and
without
reason,
we
respectfully
submit
your
honors
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
traynor
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
portion
of
the
story
of
this
case
that
was
related
to
you
by
the
attorney
general
was
fairly
stated
but
it's
not
the
complete
story
in
this
case.
this
case
is
a
very
weak
factual
case.
it
began
when
the
federal
agents
started
the
eavesdropping
on
the
defendant's
home
and
turned
up
no
evidence
of
any
sales
of
narcotics.
the
next
step
the
police
took
in
this
case
was
to
arrest
at
dawn
an
unreliable
and
untrustworthy
informer
and
subject
him
to
several
hours
of
interrogation.
at
the
conclusion
of
which,
he
agreed
to
act
for
the
police
as
a
participating
informer
and
what
is
commonly
as
a
police-controlled
narcotics
buying.
the
two
officers
who
were
stationed
outside
the
defendant's
residence
only
said
that
he
took
the
description
of
the
defendant,
that
the
man
who
came
out
of
the
house.
one
of
those
officers
said
the
man
limped.
the
other
officer
said
he'd
walked
fairly
normally.
there
was
a
discrepancy
at
the
outset
in
their
physical
identification.
the
mark
money
that
was
given
to
the
informer
as
one
of
the
ingredients
of
trying
to
tie
the
sale
to
this
defendant
was
never
found.
the
other
ingredient
of
trying
--
that
the
officers
are
trying
to
tie
this
sale
to
the
defendant
was
to
have
him
supervise
and
constantly
observe
the
transaction.
this
attempt
failed.
agent
alameda,
who
was
stationed
down
at
the
market,
lost
sight
of
the
informer
and
the
suspect
during
the
crucial
two
to
three
minutes
of
transaction
occurred.
the
two
other
officers
were
stationed
at
a
point
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away.
their
view
was
obstructed
in
part
by
a
passing
and
parked
cars
and
they
also
conflicted
on
the
very
important
part
of
their
testimony.
one
of
them
placed
the
informer
inside
the
car
on
the
right
hand
side.
the
other
one
placed
the
informer
had
to
be
standing
outside
the
car
at
the
driver's
side.
mrs.
galley
(ph),
who
is
the
aunt
of
defendant
that
was
home,
they've
tried
to
place
him
in
residence
with
regard
to
the
phone
call
on
re-direct
examination,
was
asked
about
the
phone
call.
she
said,
"i've
answered
the
phone
and
i've
told
him
that
only
the
girls
that
would
be
calling
him."
in
this
case,
we
had
a
testimony
that
there
was
a
man
calling
and
not
girls.
the
participating
unreliable
untrustworthy
informer
was
never
produced
as
a
witness
at
this
trial.
he
was
never
in
the
case
although
he
was
the
really
most
important
salient
witness
against
the
defendant.
the
defendant
took
the
stand
and
testified
in
his
own
behalf
and
contradicted
the
testimony
of
these
police
officers.
this
was
such
a
weak
case
that
the
prosecutor
must
have
thought
and
did
think
that
every
piece
of
paper,
every
scarp
of
evidence
including
a
scrap
of
paper
would
be
necessary
to
contribute
to
a
conviction
and
so
it
did.
it
is
for
this
reason
in
the
constant
references
to
the
attempt
of
the
prosecutor
to
establish
the
connection
between
brown
paper,
the
swallowing
of
the
piece
of
brown
paper
package
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
the
defendant's
use
of
the
brown
paper
in
testimony
during
his
unconstitutional
interrogation
at
the
police
station
and
the
placement
and
finally
and
most
importantly
the
placement
of
this
illegal
piece
of
paper
in
the
very
same
exhibit
as
the
subject
of
the
crime
for
which
the
man
was
charged.
mr.
michael
traynor
i
think
there's
two
parts
to
that
answer,
mr.
justice
stewart.
one
is
as
of
a
matter
of
state
law
they
construed
the
vehicle
forfeiture
statute
not
to
authorize
the
kind
of
search
that
was
made
here.
without
that
kind
of
authority,
this
case
became
for
the
state
--
district
court
of
appeal
the
same
kind
of
case
as
the
preston
case.
simply,
a
vehicle
in
lawful
custody,
and
they
said
it
was
in
lawful
custody.
mr.
michael
traynor
in
lawful
custody
and
they
said
so
in
their
opinion.
and
that
being
in
lawful
custody
was
simply
a
preston
case
and
was
controlled
by
it.
mr.
michael
traynor
lawful
custody
of
the
police,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
michael
traynor
i
think
that's
right.
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here,
your
honor,
if
it
were
not
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor
and
they
relied
on
both
the
preston
case
and
the
case
in
california
called
the
burke
case
which
followed
preston
which
involved
the
obtaining
of
a
car
under
the
vehicle
code
when
a
man's
arrested
on
the
highway
obtaining
and
putting
him
on
custody.
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
my
reading
of
the
burke
case,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
it
followed
preston
and
relied
on
it
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
--
mr.
michael
traynor
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
traynor
no,
this
is
--
this
case
is
here
because
it
was
a
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
michael
traynor
under
the
preston
--
mr.
michael
traynor
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
a
would
be
a
very
difficult
argument
to
make
because
on
the
record
in
the
preston
case,
the
--
one
of
the
arguments
made
was
that
the
police
had
caused
to
believe
that
the
car
was
in
fact
stolen
and
that
it
was
in
lawful
custody
of
the
police
because
it
was
stolen.
and
in
fact,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
--
mr.
michael
traynor
i'm
not
so
sure
that
would
be
the
correct
answer,
your
honor.
this
--
the
district
court
of
appeal,
if
that
were
the
case,
i
think
properly
relied
on
preston
even
assuming
as
--
even
assuming
preston
was
not
controlling.
preston
--
i
don't
think
should
be
read
as
simply
establishing
the
outer
limits
otherwise,
to
read
it
otherwise
would
discourage
the
state
and
federal
courts
from
taking
the
decision
to
this
court
and
following
them
and
applying
them
in
the
cases
where
they
should
be
controlled.
the
district
court
of
appeal
properly,
i
think,
interpreted
the
preston
case
to
apply
to
this.
we
have
the
same
element
of
lawful
custody
in
both
cases.
the
state's
reliance
on
the
ninth
circuit
federal
court
case
under
the
narcotics
statutes
is
a
case
that
didn't
even
bother
to
cite
the
preston
case
even
though
it
was
decided
after
it.
the
--
there's
really
no
justification
for
distinguishing
the
preston
case
here.
what
the
state
is
really
attempting
to
do
is
to
overrule
the
preston
case
or
to
trivialize
it
by
exceptions
that
there
are
no
available
exceptions
in
this
case.
the
important
point
i
wanted
to
make
coming
back
is
that
this
was
an
extremely
weak
case
against
the
defendant.
every
piece
--
every
scrap
of
paper
was
necessary
and
it
was
used
and
it
hurt
and
it
hurt
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court
and
it
hurt
him
in
the
appellate
court.
and
for
that
reason
his
conviction
was
unconstitutionally
obtained
and
for
that
reason
also
it
must
be
reversed
respectfully.
thank
you
very
much.
