stewart
mr.
traynor,
wasn't
there
a
seed
of
marijuana
or
something
like
that
also?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
an
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not;
it's
only
the
brown
paper
sack?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
objection
made
at
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
so
you
--
you're
view
--
you
concede
that
the
introduction
of
that
is
not
before
us
here
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
that,
is
it
clear
that
in
so
holding,
they
were
relying
on
the
federal
constitution
rather
than
the
state
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cooper
(inaudible)
of
a
search?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
traynor,
do
you
think
it's
clear
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
that
this
paper
was
seized
unlawfully
in
reliance
upon
the
federal
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
in
lawful
custody.
justice
potter
stewart
but
after
construing
the
state
law,
then
you
think
it
is
clear
that
they
based
their
ultimate
decision
on
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
your
--
the
california
constitution
has
some
sort
of
an
--
quite
equivalent
to
the
fourth
amendment,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
burke
case
decided
under
the
thought
that
it
was
--
that
that
result
was
compelled
by
the
federal
constitution?
justice
