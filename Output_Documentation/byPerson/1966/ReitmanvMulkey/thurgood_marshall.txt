mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.we
appeared
today
as
amicus
in
these
cases
because
we
believe
that
the
two
of
them
represents
serious
and
far-reaching
questions
regarding
the
extent
to
which
states
may
by
indirect
means
substantially
contribute
to
invidious
discrimination
of
a
kind
which
if
practiced
directly
would
certainly
clearly
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
subject
matter
of
the
state
constitutional
provision
involved
here
against
the
discrimination
in
the
sales
and
rental
of
housing
is
an
addition
of
subsequent
concern
to
the
executive
branch
of
our
government
as
is
indicated
by
present
proposals
for
legislation
on
the
federal
level.
these
cases
concerned
the
validity
of
formal
legal
action
taken
by
the
state
of
california
with
respect
to
discrimination
in
housing.
and
in
our
view,
the
action
so
taken
goes
beyond
constitutional
bounds.the
provision
of
the
state
constitution
which
i
would
prefer
to
just
call
“proposition
14”
because
that's
the
way
it's
commonly
accepted
and
designated
throughout
the
state
of
california,
is
we
believe
demonstrably
an
exercise
of
state
power
in
support
of
racial
discrimination
as
such.
in
support
of
this
conclusion,
we
have
urged
three
lines
of
argument.
one
i
proposed
to
deal
very
briefly
because
it's
already
been
discussed
by
--
a
long
time.
the
rest
is
essentially
on
the
principle
set
forth
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
concurring
opinion
in
the
burton
case
--
the
wilmington
case.
and
although
they
had
believed
he
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
harlan
believed
it
was
not
applicable
to
the
facts
of
the
case
they
still
agreed
with
this
principle.
and
that
principle,
as
i
understand
it
is
that
a
state
may
not
solemnly
enact
into
law
an
explicit
official
authorization
of
racial
exclusion
or
racial
discrimination.
that
is
true
because
such
an
enactment
by
its
very
nature
puts
the
state
on
the
side
of
racial
distinctions
and
racial
discriminations.
aside
to
which
the
state
simply
may
not,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
tip
the
scales
even
by
a
hair's
breadth,
that's
what
burton
tells
me.
the
proposition
that
a
state
must
maintain
the
strictest
neutrality
with
respect
to
private
racial
discrimination
has
of
course
been
firmly
established
and
is
recently
in
anderson
against
martin.
and
in
light
of
its
history,
this
history
of
pro
--
proposition
14
which
was
so
fully
discussed
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
and
the
briefs
here,
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
it
actually
enshrines
as
it
carefully
secured
and
preferred
right
of
california
citizens,
a
preferred
right
because
it
was
deliberately
put
in
the
section
with
rights
of
free
speech,
free
exercise
of
religion,
et
cetera.
and
for
that
reason,
we
come
to
the
second
line
in
this
argument.
and
that
emphasizes
that
proposition
14
is
not
merely
a
state
statute.
it's
not
a
statute
which
is
subject
to
the
ordinary
interplay
of
political
pressures
within
the
jurisdiction
of
what
remains
the
law.
and
i
say
in
the
question
as
to
the
difference
between
this
being
a
constitutional
provision
or
a
statute,
the
important
point
is
it
can
only
be
removed
by
a
vote
of
the
people
of
california.
and
the
people
we
are
arguing
about
here
are
the
underprivileged
people
in
the
state
of
california
and
i
don't
think
anybody
denied
that
you
don't
get
referendum
by
any
place
without
hard
earned
cash
and
plenty
of
it.
the
whole
level
of
political
acumen
in
california
as
in
any
other
places
makes
it
possible
that
a
minority
group
may
have
some
political
strength
in
an
area
here
or
an
area
there.
but
in
no
state
that
i
know
of
do
the
minority
groups
have
statewide
power.
and
that's
the
reason
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
provision
was
deliberately
put
into
the
constitution,
it
was
no
accident.
and
i
agree
that
if
it
just
had
been
a
repeal,
we
would
not
be
here.
the
permanence
it
has
as
a
constitutional
provision
and
the
sweeping
effect
which
it
must
be
given
its
all
inclusive
prohibition
by
local
governmental
agencies
distinguishes
it
from
a
simple
statute,
declaring
the
state's
neutrality.
i
--
i
don't
understand
this
argument
that
all
it
does
is
to
say,
“well,
everybody's
free.”
but
incorporating
proposition
14
in
the
constitution,
california
said
that
legislation
of
governmental
action
of
any
sort
may
not
be
taken
to
eliminate
or
reduce
private
racial
discrimination
in
housing
unless
one,
either
two-thirds
of
the
legislature
move
or
the
issue
is
put
up
to
vote
by
the
majority
of
the
people.
racial
and
other
minorities
and
classes
which
are
the
likely
victims
of
discrimination
in
housing
are
virtue
--
by
virtue
of
their
minority
status
itself,
placed
in
an
obvious
disadvantage.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
the
executive
branch.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
insofar
as
the
courts
are
concerned,
it's
an
absolute
bar
to
a
legal
action.
the
--
as
i
understand
proposition
14,
if
someone
sues
on
a
common
law
theory,
that
he
cannot
be
refused
the
rental
of
that
building,
the
court
itself
can
dismiss
it
without
requiring
the
defendant
to
even
answer.
and
the
only
answer
the
defendant
would
be
required
to
make
is
to
“section
26”
and
you're
out
of
court.
it's
an
absolute
bar.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
constitutionality
of
it?
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
under
the
federal
constitution,
i
say
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
didn't
affect
race.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
absolutely
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
it's
according
to
what
the
state
policy
is.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
it
is
a
state
policy
is
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
i
am
only
saying
that
the
state
of
california
by
--
cannot
by
any
action
(inaudible)
by
vote,
or
by
legislative
act,
or
by
the
courts
encourage
racial
discrimination.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
say.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
we
say
that
--
i'm
not
abandoning
the
method.
i'm
merely
saying
that
that's
a
part
of
the
picture,
that's
additional
reason
to
understand
what
proposition
14
means.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
there
was
no
unruh
law
and
no
rumford
act
ever
passed
and
proposition
14
was
the
first
legislation
passed
involved
in
housing,
i
would
take
the
exact
same
position
i
take
now,
the
exact
same
position,
because
the
state
has
moved
from
its
neutral
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
i
--
i'm
not
attacking
the
method
as
such.
i'm
just
--
the
result
is
--
i
think
if
the
court
had
taken
this
position,
would
be
one
thing,
the
legislature
would
be
one
thing,
the
executive
would
be
one
thing.
but
here,
california
did
not
say
that
anybody
can
discriminate
if
they
want
to
on
the
grounds
of
race.
california,
by
adopting
proposition
14
and
in
the
breadths
of
its
language,
encourages
it.
it's
far
from
being
neutral.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
been
enacted?
surely,
i'd
have
the
same
argument.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
same
argument.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
just
have
more
force
with
(inaudible)
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
--
well,
i
--
i
--
well,
let's
--
let's
--
let's
be
reasonable
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
agree,
mr.
justice
black,
with
all
due
respect,
that
a
movement
in
19
--
in
these
years
toward
perpetuating
racial
prejudice
is
progress
by
anybody.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do
not
know
if
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
if
i
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
point,
i
might
get
a
little
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
facts
show
that
the
argument
of
people
in
minority
groups,
and
with
help
of
others
were
able
to
get
the
unruh
act
through
and
were
able
to
get
the
rumford
act
through.
and
now
that
it's
in
the
constitution
that
was
the
reason
it
was
put
in
the
constitution,
because
everybody
knows
that
the
minorities
do
not
have
that
much
strength
on
a
statewide
basis.
those
are
facts.
i
mean
i'm
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
mr.
justice
that
the
real
estate
board
didn't
put
unruh
and
rumford
through,
that
we
can
be
sure
of.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
either
sir.
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
the
california
law.
but
i
do
know
this
that
we
have
had
courts,
at
least
a
court
that
did
rule
in
a
civil
rights
case
in
1890
in
michigan,
and
said
he
did
need
the
civil
rights
law
to
maintain
the
common
law
right
of
a
negro
to
be
served.
that
case
was
cited
in
mr.
justice
goldberg's
concurring
opinion
in
the
maryland
case.
i
do
say
that
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
the
large
number
of
municipalities
and
local
units
in
this
country
that
have
adopted
fair
housing
provisions.
and
they
couldn't
now
in
california
if
in
county
z
in
california,
all
of
the
people
decide
that
open
housing
is
good
and
that
20
--
the
20%
of
the
group
said,
“no,
we
don't
want
it.”
and
the
80%
say,
“we
want
it
and
we
are
in
favor
of
adopting
a
resolution
in
our
county
requiring
fair
housing,”
they
can
do
it
under
this
act
and
that's
the
point
i've
been
trying
to
get
through
mr.
justice
black
that
the
vote
of
the
small
unit
is
gone,
you
can't
use
any
local
pressure.
the
governor
--
i
mean
the
--
that
was
a
mistake.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
in
this
case.
certainly,
he
doesn't
agree
with
it.
but
his
hands
are
tied.
the
whole
executive
branch
of
the
government
is
tied.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
would
be
a
beautiful
--
i
think
that,
really,
our
differences
--
if
this
were
the
unruh
or
the
rumford
act
had
been
a
constitutional
provision,
i'd
be
all
for
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
the
--
two,
the
constitutional
provision
has
the
same
validity
regardless
of
which
side
it
takes.
but
this
one
is
a
wrong
one.
and
it
makes
no
difference
where
it
is,
it's
wrong.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
think.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
sure
it
does.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
be
far
from
doing
anything
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
people
to
adopt
their
laws
and
their
constitution,
subject
only
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that's
--
that's
my
own
theory.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
the
courts
would
be
obliged
to
because
under
article
vi,
the
judges
have
to
take
the
oath
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
apply
both
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
say
that
this
provision
is
an
absolute
bar
to
a
court
taking
any
action
against
racial
discrimination
in
housing.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
i
think
in
support
of
that
is
the
attorney
general
himself
to
file
his
brief
here.
and
i
think
that
that
brief
would
be
speaking
for
the
entire
executive
side
of
the
state
of
california.
and
the
--
the
real
difficulty
here
is
that
we
all
know
there
is
considerable
movement
toward
voluntarily
working
out
open
housing
problems.
and
the
movement
is
much
accentuated
on
the
local
level.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
true
in
california
or
not,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
reports
that
we
filed
in
our
brief.
all
of
those,
i
mean,
we
right
here,
we
know
up
in
montgomery
county.
there's
a
big
movement
there.
it's
all
over
the
country.
but
here,
you
can't
do
it.
the
other
point
is
that
even
if
somebody
--
the
people
that
reads
this
and
there
despite
the
fact
that
it's
not
directly
material,
the
literature
in
all
of
it
was
set
up.
it's
in
the
uaw's
brief
and
all.
there's
some
people
that
now
whose
conscience
is
telling
them
they
should
open
their
houses
up.
they
should
open
their
apartments
up.
they
get
the
idea
that
the
state
says
“don't
do
it!”
it
gives
the
--
the
person
whose
conscience
is
working
on
him
a
block
that
says,
“you
don't
have
to
do
this.”
and
it's
the
opposite
of
the
neutral
position
that
the
state
should
take
in
these
matters.
and
i
say
the
neutral
position
because
i
don't
want
it
understood
that
i
would
object
to
the
state
taking
the
other
position
like
the
--
the
rumford
act
or
what
have
you.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
they
can
repeal.
they
could
have
repealed
rumford.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
black,
my
point
is,
if
they
--
they
repealed
unruh
and
rumford,
the
courts
could
--
could
move
in
if
they
were
(inaudible),
and
say
that
the
common
law
is
not
what
you
say
it
is.
the
local
county
units
could
move
in.
maybe
the
--
i
don't
know
the
powers
of
the
governor
but
i
mean
maybe
some
executive
branch
could
move
in.
there
are
lot
of
ways
that
this
problem
with
racial
discrimination
in
housing
could
be
solved,
if
--
even
if
unruh
and
rumford
were
repealed.
but
instead
of
just
repealing
them,
they'd
put
in
this
positive
provision
the
bars
anybody,
bars
anybody
from
interfering.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
perfectly
legitimate
--
we
don't
quarrel
that
it
was
not
properly
adopted.
but
when
it
was
adopted,
it
was
about
to
its
subject
to
this
court's
determination
as
to
whether
it
was
constitutional
or
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
subject
to
its
own
state
court.
and
i'm
not
abandoning
the
fact
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
that
its
own
state
supreme
courts
said
it
was.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
--
it
can
declare
a
provision.
the
supreme
court
deliberately
said
that
we
don't
use
that
right.
but
we
moved
purely
on
federal
grounds.
i
think
that's
the
reason
the
court
did
it.
it
was
because
they
were
worried
about
that
point.
i
think
it's
what
it
was.
but
the
--
the
ultimate
decision
would
have
to
be
made
by
this
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
that
is
our
position.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
state
has
shifted
from
its
neutral
position
on
race.
and
when
you
shift
from
your
neutral
position,
the
thumb
is
on
the
scales.
and
i
used
that
the
line
of
cases
of
--
ending
up
with
burden.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
is
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
is
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
just
say
that
that
helps
our
basic
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
need
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
so
because
it's
giving
encouragement
to
racial
discrimination
and
it
is
shackling
handcuffing
all
state
agencies
from
doing
anything
to
eliminate
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
know
that
sir.
(inaudible)
thank
you
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
one
was
in
orange
county
and
one
was
in
los
angeles.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so.
i
think
there's
no
question
about
it.
it's
also
this
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
definitely
yes.
this
case
was
filed
before
14,
and
it
laid
around
when
14
came
out,
the
defendant
came
in
it
says,
14
dismissed,
it's
dismissed.
that's
what
happened.
oh,
i'm
not
saying
it
was
passed
discretionary
for
this
person
but
with
all
due
respect
it
did.
it's
our
position
that
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
situation
as
it
exists
cannot
be
put
within
the
four
corners
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
the
three
reasons
set
out.
the
one
we
urged
the
strongest
is
the
overbreadth
and
the
extent
to
which
it
was
done,
the
encouragement
point
is
a
secondary
point
to
our
argument.
but
on
any
basis,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
should
be
affirmed
and
back
to
the
question
we
asked
yesterday,
we
don't
necessarily
urge
that
beyond
the
exact
same
grounds
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
but
we
think
our
three
points
do
stand
up
and
require
the
affirmance.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.we
appeared
today
as
amicus
in
these
cases
because
we
believe
that
the
two
of
them
represents
serious
and
far-reaching
questions
regarding
the
extent
to
which
states
may
by
indirect
means
substantially
contribute
to
invidious
discrimination
of
a
kind
which
if
practiced
directly
would
certainly
clearly
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
subject
matter
of
the
state
constitutional
provision
involved
here
against
the
discrimination
in
the
sales
and
rental
of
housing
is
an
addition
of
subsequent
concern
to
the
executive
branch
of
our
government
as
is
indicated
by
present
proposals
for
legislation
on
the
federal
level.
these
cases
concerned
the
validity
of
formal
legal
action
taken
by
the
state
of
california
with
respect
to
discrimination
in
housing.
and
in
our
view,
the
action
so
taken
goes
beyond
constitutional
bounds.the
provision
of
the
state
constitution
which
i
would
prefer
to
just
call
“proposition
14”
because
that's
the
way
it's
commonly
accepted
and
designated
throughout
the
state
of
california,
is
we
believe
demonstrably
an
exercise
of
state
power
in
support
of
racial
discrimination
as
such.
in
support
of
this
conclusion,
we
have
urged
three
lines
of
argument.
one
i
proposed
to
deal
very
briefly
because
it's
already
been
discussed
by
--
a
long
time.
the
rest
is
essentially
on
the
principle
set
forth
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
concurring
opinion
in
the
burton
case
--
the
wilmington
case.
and
although
they
had
believed
he
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
harlan
believed
it
was
not
applicable
to
the
facts
of
the
case
they
still
agreed
with
this
principle.
and
that
principle,
as
i
understand
it
is
that
a
state
may
not
solemnly
enact
into
law
an
explicit
official
authorization
of
racial
exclusion
or
racial
discrimination.
that
is
true
because
such
an
enactment
by
its
very
nature
puts
the
state
on
the
side
of
racial
distinctions
and
racial
discriminations.
aside
to
which
the
state
simply
may
not,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
tip
the
scales
even
by
a
hair's
breadth,
that's
what
burton
tells
me.
the
proposition
that
a
state
must
maintain
the
strictest
neutrality
with
respect
to
private
racial
discrimination
has
of
course
been
firmly
established
and
is
recently
in
anderson
against
martin.
and
in
light
of
its
history,
this
history
of
pro
--
proposition
14
which
was
so
fully
discussed
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
and
the
briefs
here,
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
it
actually
enshrines
as
it
carefully
secured
and
preferred
right
of
california
citizens,
a
preferred
right
because
it
was
deliberately
put
in
the
section
with
rights
of
free
speech,
free
exercise
of
religion,
et
cetera.
and
for
that
reason,
we
come
to
the
second
line
in
this
argument.
and
that
emphasizes
that
proposition
14
is
not
merely
a
state
statute.
it's
not
a
statute
which
is
subject
to
the
ordinary
interplay
of
political
pressures
within
the
jurisdiction
of
what
remains
the
law.
and
i
say
in
the
question
as
to
the
difference
between
this
being
a
constitutional
provision
or
a
statute,
the
important
point
is
it
can
only
be
removed
by
a
vote
of
the
people
of
california.
and
the
people
we
are
arguing
about
here
are
the
underprivileged
people
in
the
state
of
california
and
i
don't
think
anybody
denied
that
you
don't
get
referendum
by
any
place
without
hard
earned
cash
and
plenty
of
it.
the
whole
level
of
political
acumen
in
california
as
in
any
other
places
makes
it
possible
that
a
minority
group
may
have
some
political
strength
in
an
area
here
or
an
area
there.
but
in
no
state
that
i
know
of
do
the
minority
groups
have
statewide
power.
and
that's
the
reason
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
provision
was
deliberately
put
into
the
constitution,
it
was
no
accident.
and
i
agree
that
if
it
just
had
been
a
repeal,
we
would
not
be
here.
the
permanence
it
has
as
a
constitutional
provision
and
the
sweeping
effect
which
it
must
be
given
its
all
inclusive
prohibition
by
local
governmental
agencies
distinguishes
it
from
a
simple
statute,
declaring
the
state's
neutrality.
i
--
i
don't
understand
this
argument
that
all
it
does
is
to
say,
“well,
everybody's
free.”
but
incorporating
proposition
14
in
the
constitution,
california
said
that
legislation
of
governmental
action
of
any
sort
may
not
be
taken
to
eliminate
or
reduce
private
racial
discrimination
in
housing
unless
one,
either
two-thirds
of
the
legislature
move
or
the
issue
is
put
up
to
vote
by
the
majority
of
the
people.
racial
and
other
minorities
and
classes
which
are
the
likely
victims
of
discrimination
in
housing
are
virtue
--
by
virtue
of
their
minority
status
itself,
placed
in
an
obvious
disadvantage.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
the
executive
branch.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
insofar
as
the
courts
are
concerned,
it's
an
absolute
bar
to
a
legal
action.
the
--
as
i
understand
proposition
14,
if
someone
sues
on
a
common
law
theory,
that
he
cannot
be
refused
the
rental
of
that
building,
the
court
itself
can
dismiss
it
without
requiring
the
defendant
to
even
answer.
and
the
only
answer
the
defendant
would
be
required
to
make
is
to
“section
26”
and
you're
out
of
court.
it's
an
absolute
bar.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
constitutionality
of
it?
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
under
the
federal
constitution,
i
say
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
didn't
affect
race.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
absolutely
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
it's
according
to
what
the
state
policy
is.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
it
is
a
state
policy
is
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
i
am
only
saying
that
the
state
of
california
by
--
cannot
by
any
action
(inaudible)
by
vote,
or
by
legislative
act,
or
by
the
courts
encourage
racial
discrimination.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
say.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
we
say
that
--
i'm
not
abandoning
the
method.
i'm
merely
saying
that
that's
a
part
of
the
picture,
that's
additional
reason
to
understand
what
proposition
14
means.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
there
was
no
unruh
law
and
no
rumford
act
ever
passed
and
proposition
14
was
the
first
legislation
passed
involved
in
housing,
i
would
take
the
exact
same
position
i
take
now,
the
exact
same
position,
because
the
state
has
moved
from
its
neutral
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
i
--
i'm
not
attacking
the
method
as
such.
i'm
just
--
the
result
is
--
i
think
if
the
court
had
taken
this
position,
would
be
one
thing,
the
legislature
would
be
one
thing,
the
executive
would
be
one
thing.
but
here,
california
did
not
say
that
anybody
can
discriminate
if
they
want
to
on
the
grounds
of
race.
california,
by
adopting
proposition
14
and
in
the
breadths
of
its
language,
encourages
it.
it's
far
from
being
neutral.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
been
enacted?
surely,
i'd
have
the
same
argument.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
same
argument.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
just
have
more
force
with
(inaudible)
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
--
well,
i
--
i
--
well,
let's
--
let's
--
let's
be
reasonable
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
agree,
mr.
justice
black,
with
all
due
respect,
that
a
movement
in
19
--
in
these
years
toward
perpetuating
racial
prejudice
is
progress
by
anybody.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do
not
know
if
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
if
i
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
point,
i
might
get
a
little
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
facts
show
that
the
argument
of
people
in
minority
groups,
and
with
help
of
others
were
able
to
get
the
unruh
act
through
and
were
able
to
get
the
rumford
act
through.
and
now
that
it's
in
the
constitution
that
was
the
reason
it
was
put
in
the
constitution,
because
everybody
knows
that
the
minorities
do
not
have
that
much
strength
on
a
statewide
basis.
those
are
facts.
i
mean
i'm
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
mr.
justice
that
the
real
estate
board
didn't
put
unruh
and
rumford
through,
that
we
can
be
sure
of.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
either
sir.
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
the
california
law.
but
i
do
know
this
that
we
have
had
courts,
at
least
a
court
that
did
rule
in
a
civil
rights
case
in
1890
in
michigan,
and
said
he
did
need
the
civil
rights
law
to
maintain
the
common
law
right
of
a
negro
to
be
served.
that
case
was
cited
in
mr.
justice
goldberg's
concurring
opinion
in
the
maryland
case.
i
do
say
that
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
the
large
number
of
municipalities
and
local
units
in
this
country
that
have
adopted
fair
housing
provisions.
and
they
couldn't
now
in
california
if
in
county
z
in
california,
all
of
the
people
decide
that
open
housing
is
good
and
that
20
--
the
20%
of
the
group
said,
“no,
we
don't
want
it.”
and
the
80%
say,
“we
want
it
and
we
are
in
favor
of
adopting
a
resolution
in
our
county
requiring
fair
housing,”
they
can
do
it
under
this
act
and
that's
the
point
i've
been
trying
to
get
through
mr.
justice
black
that
the
vote
of
the
small
unit
is
gone,
you
can't
use
any
local
pressure.
the
governor
--
i
mean
the
--
that
was
a
mistake.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
in
this
case.
certainly,
he
doesn't
agree
with
it.
but
his
hands
are
tied.
the
whole
executive
branch
of
the
government
is
tied.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
would
be
a
beautiful
--
i
think
that,
really,
our
differences
--
if
this
were
the
unruh
or
the
rumford
act
had
been
a
constitutional
provision,
i'd
be
all
for
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
the
--
two,
the
constitutional
provision
has
the
same
validity
regardless
of
which
side
it
takes.
but
this
one
is
a
wrong
one.
and
it
makes
no
difference
where
it
is,
it's
wrong.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
think.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
sure
it
does.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
be
far
from
doing
anything
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
people
to
adopt
their
laws
and
their
constitution,
subject
only
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that's
--
that's
my
own
theory.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
the
courts
would
be
obliged
to
because
under
article
vi,
the
judges
have
to
take
the
oath
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
apply
both
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
say
that
this
provision
is
an
absolute
bar
to
a
court
taking
any
action
against
racial
discrimination
in
housing.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
i
think
in
support
of
that
is
the
attorney
general
himself
to
file
his
brief
here.
and
i
think
that
that
brief
would
be
speaking
for
the
entire
executive
side
of
the
state
of
california.
and
the
--
the
real
difficulty
here
is
that
we
all
know
there
is
considerable
movement
toward
voluntarily
working
out
open
housing
problems.
and
the
movement
is
much
accentuated
on
the
local
level.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
true
in
california
or
not,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
reports
that
we
filed
in
our
brief.
all
of
those,
i
mean,
we
right
here,
we
know
up
in
montgomery
county.
there's
a
big
movement
there.
it's
all
over
the
country.
but
here,
you
can't
do
it.
the
other
point
is
that
even
if
somebody
--
the
people
that
reads
this
and
there
despite
the
fact
that
it's
not
directly
material,
the
literature
in
all
of
it
was
set
up.
it's
in
the
uaw's
brief
and
all.
there's
some
people
that
now
whose
conscience
is
telling
them
they
should
open
their
houses
up.
they
should
open
their
apartments
up.
they
get
the
idea
that
the
state
says
“don't
do
it!”
it
gives
the
--
the
person
whose
conscience
is
working
on
him
a
block
that
says,
“you
don't
have
to
do
this.”
and
it's
the
opposite
of
the
neutral
position
that
the
state
should
take
in
these
matters.
and
i
say
the
neutral
position
because
i
don't
want
it
understood
that
i
would
object
to
the
state
taking
the
other
position
like
the
--
the
rumford
act
or
what
have
you.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
they
can
repeal.
they
could
have
repealed
rumford.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
black,
my
point
is,
if
they
--
they
repealed
unruh
and
rumford,
the
courts
could
--
could
move
in
if
they
were
(inaudible),
and
say
that
the
common
law
is
not
what
you
say
it
is.
the
local
county
units
could
move
in.
maybe
the
--
i
don't
know
the
powers
of
the
governor
but
i
mean
maybe
some
executive
branch
could
move
in.
there
are
lot
of
ways
that
this
problem
with
racial
discrimination
in
housing
could
be
solved,
if
--
even
if
unruh
and
rumford
were
repealed.
but
instead
of
just
repealing
them,
they'd
put
in
this
positive
provision
the
bars
anybody,
bars
anybody
from
interfering.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
perfectly
legitimate
--
we
don't
quarrel
that
it
was
not
properly
adopted.
but
when
it
was
adopted,
it
was
about
to
its
subject
to
this
court's
determination
as
to
whether
it
was
constitutional
or
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
subject
to
its
own
state
court.
and
i'm
not
abandoning
the
fact
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
that
its
own
state
supreme
courts
said
it
was.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
--
it
can
declare
a
provision.
the
supreme
court
deliberately
said
that
we
don't
use
that
right.
but
we
moved
purely
on
federal
grounds.
i
think
that's
the
reason
the
court
did
it.
it
was
because
they
were
worried
about
that
point.
i
think
it's
what
it
was.
but
the
--
the
ultimate
decision
would
have
to
be
made
by
this
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
that
is
our
position.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
state
has
shifted
from
its
neutral
position
on
race.
and
when
you
shift
from
your
neutral
position,
the
thumb
is
on
the
scales.
and
i
used
that
the
line
of
cases
of
--
ending
up
with
burden.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
is
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
is
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
just
say
that
that
helps
our
basic
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
need
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
so
because
it's
giving
encouragement
to
racial
discrimination
and
it
is
shackling
handcuffing
all
state
agencies
from
doing
anything
to
eliminate
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
know
that
sir.
(inaudible)
thank
you
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
one
was
in
orange
county
and
one
was
in
los
angeles.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so.
i
think
there's
no
question
about
it.
it's
also
this
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
definitely
yes.
this
case
was
filed
before
14,
and
it
laid
around
when
14
came
out,
the
defendant
came
in
it
says,
14
dismissed,
it's
dismissed.
that's
what
happened.
oh,
i'm
not
saying
it
was
passed
discretionary
for
this
person
but
with
all
due
respect
it
did.
it's
our
position
that
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
situation
as
it
exists
cannot
be
put
within
the
four
corners
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
the
three
reasons
set
out.
the
one
we
urged
the
strongest
is
the
overbreadth
and
the
extent
to
which
it
was
done,
the
encouragement
point
is
a
secondary
point
to
our
argument.
but
on
any
basis,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
should
be
affirmed
and
back
to
the
question
we
asked
yesterday,
we
don't
necessarily
urge
that
beyond
the
exact
same
grounds
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
but
we
think
our
three
points
do
stand
up
and
require
the
affirmance.
