justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
other
building?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
in
orange
county?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
have
--
i
would
have
supposed
that
the
first
paragraph
of
section
26,
expressly
makes
invalid
and
unenforceable
--
a
restrictive
covenant,
because
that
paragraph
says,
neither
the
state
nor
any
subdivision
or
agency,
thereof,
and
i
would
assume
that
would
include
the
state
court,
shall
deny,
limit
or
abridge,
directly
or
indirectly,
the
right
of
any
person
who
is
willing
or
desires
to
sell,
lease
or
rent
part
or
all
his
real
property,
to
decline
to
sell,
lease
or
rent
such
property
to
such
person
or
persons
as
he,
in
his
absolute
discretion,
and
i
suppose
that
we
give
him
the
right
to
violate
the
conditions
of
the
restrictive
covenant,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
federal
preemption
by
a
statutory
enactment
of
congress
and
as
well
as
the
problems
of
the
interstate
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
logically,
if
the
unruh
act
position
is
determined
within
the
rumford
act
or
in
fact,
provisions
of
the
california
constitution,
which
have
then
been
replaced
by
proposition
14.
i
gather
you
think
the
california
supreme
court
would've
said
that
even
that
constitutional
change
could
not
be
met.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
part
of
the
governmental
apparatus
in
california.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
i
--
i
haven't
read
the
hill
case,
the
hill
case
which
was
referred
to
the
brief,
the
third
case.
but
i
understand
the
reasoning
of
the
court
at
least,
and
the
result
on
that
case,
it
indicates
that
the
california
courts
rather
accepted
your
argument
about
repeal
of
the
two
earlier
statutes,
because
there,
since
there
had
never
been
any
statute,
they
said
there
could
be
a
private
discrimination,
am
i
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
explain
the
hill
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that's
--
and
you
say
that's
notwithstanding,
the
purpose
as
expressed
you
say
in
official
document
has
doubtfully
elected
during
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
--
i
don't
follow
you
mr.
selvin.
why
--
why
think
the
silence
of
the
california
supreme
court
has
some
significance
as
to
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wirin?
justice
potter
stewart
under
california
law,
who
prepares
these
valid
arguments?
justice
potter
stewart
the
secretary
of
state
designates
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
perhaps
the
drafters
of
the
arguments
on
both
sides?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
they're
subject
to
any
editorial
supervision
by
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
so
anybody
can
say
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
so
once
designated
by
the
secretary
of
state,
the
drafter
of
these
arguments
can
say
anything
he
wants
--
he'd
want
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
even
though
it's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
it
takes
liberties
with
the
--
what
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
actually
does.
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
what
the
voters
were
told?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
wirin
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
26,
if
you
agreed
that
it
did
nothing
more
than
repeal
the
provisions
of
the
unruh
and
rumford
acts
actions
you've
been
talking
about,
would
you
be
here?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
shelley
and
kraemer?
justice
potter
stewart
which
it
did
in
shelley
and
kraemer
because
it
didn't
--
any
of
the
policy
or
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
a
private
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wirin,
i
was
trying
to
help
you
in
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
in
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
wirin,
what
if
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
supreme
court
of
california
say
that
the
people
of
california
as
a
super
legislature
had
done
when
it
enacted
26?
in
other
words,
how
did
it
construe
26?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
please.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
would
as
i
read
the
briefs.
justice
potter
stewart
if
by
referendum,
they
put
it
into
a
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
if
the
people
put
it
into
a
statute
only
the
people
could
change
it
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wirin.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
prompted
by
what
i
read
in
the
reply
brief
with
petitioners,
the
bottom
of
page
6
and
the
top
of
page
7
and
i
understand
the
answer
to
your
question,
you
tell
me
that
that
--
that
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
misrepresented
this
to
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioners,
the
bottom
of
page
6
and
the
top
of
page
7
which
says
that
--
it's
quotes
--
it
quotes
--
it
quotes
article
4,
section
1
of
the
california
constitution
and
it
receives
to
say,
“accordingly
had
to
measure
--
propose
a
statute
rather
than
amendments
in
the
california
constitution.”
it
could
still
be
repealed
or
modified
only
by
both
or
the
people.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
an
initiative,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
change.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
what
possible
difference
that
makes
to
the
federal
constitutional
issue
that's
before
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
the
--
whether
california
has
acted
through
its
legislature,
through
initiative
of
its
people,
through
its
courts,
through
some
political
subdivision,
if
that
action
violates
federal
constitution,
it
violates
it,
and
if
it
doesn't,
it
doesn't.
i
don't
see
what
possible
difference
it
makes,
what
instrumentality
of
the
state
that
it
is
acting
through.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn't
you
have
exactly
the
same
argument,
the
--
the
federal
constitutional
argument
if
the
--
if
section
26
had
been
enacted
by
the
california
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
why,
but
if
you
think
you
have,
why?
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general.
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
--
if
i
understand
your
argument
correctly,
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
mistaken,
it
would
be
substantially
the
same
argument
even
if
there
had
been
--
never
been
a
rumford
or
an
unruh
act,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
no
state
could
do
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
regardless
of
its
prior
legislative
enactments.
and
if
this
--
that
the
enactment
of
this
constitutional
provision
in
and
of
itself
quite
apart
for
many
previous
history
of
what
the
state
had
or
had
not
enacted
in
this
area
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i
thought
that
your
argument
would
be
substantially
the
same
argument
if
the
--
if
there
had
never
been
any
statutes
weren't
passed
in
this
area
by
a
state
and
if
the
common
law
had
been
the
way
--
the
conventional
common
law
has
been
with
the
exception
of
your
(inaudible)
case
and
a
couple
others.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
common
law
generally
had
been
(inaudible)
that
it
would
still
--
that
the
affirmative
adoption
by
a
state
of
section
26
would
nonetheless
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
believe
i
was
correct
in
understanding
if
that
is
your
basic
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
point
apart
from
any
--
the
prior
history
of
any
rumford
act
or
unruh
act
or
anything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
think
on
analysis
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
your
basic
position
is
that
whether
this
26
had
been
adopted
by
california
with
its
particular
history
or
by
north
dakota,
or
by
ohio,
or
by
mississippi,
or
by
any
other
state
it
would
be
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
understood.
and
i
--
i
want
you
to
--
these
are
not
rhetorical
questions.
i'm
asking
for
information
so
i'd
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
think
you
--
as
i
had
understood
your
argument,
mr.
pruitt,
it
was
that
nothing
in
here
and
obviously
nothing
in
here
does
and
quite
obviously
nothing
in
here
could
take
away
from
the
courts
their
duty
to
apply
the
federal
constitution.
i
think
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
between
you
and
my
brother
fortas
which
--
that
you
were
talking
about,
the
federal
constitution
and
he
--
he
thought
you're
talking
about
the
state
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
obviously
there's
a
change
in
this
--
in
this
(inaudible)
--
this
is
an
addition
to
the
state
constitution
and
insofar
as
its
provisions,
do
not
violate
the
federal
constitution
the
state
courts
are
bound
by
it.
but
you're
quite
right
insofar
as
this
does
violate
the
federal
constitution
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
state
judges
have
the
duty
of
following
the
federal
constitution
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
other
building?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
in
orange
county?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
have
--
i
would
have
supposed
that
the
first
paragraph
of
section
26,
expressly
makes
invalid
and
unenforceable
--
a
restrictive
covenant,
because
that
paragraph
says,
neither
the
state
nor
any
subdivision
or
agency,
thereof,
and
i
would
assume
that
would
include
the
state
court,
shall
deny,
limit
or
abridge,
directly
or
indirectly,
the
right
of
any
person
who
is
willing
or
desires
to
sell,
lease
or
rent
part
or
all
his
real
property,
to
decline
to
sell,
lease
or
rent
such
property
to
such
person
or
persons
as
he,
in
his
absolute
discretion,
and
i
suppose
that
we
give
him
the
right
to
violate
the
conditions
of
the
restrictive
covenant,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
federal
preemption
by
a
statutory
enactment
of
congress
and
as
well
as
the
problems
of
the
interstate
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
logically,
if
the
unruh
act
position
is
determined
within
the
rumford
act
or
in
fact,
provisions
of
the
california
constitution,
which
have
then
been
replaced
by
proposition
14.
i
gather
you
think
the
california
supreme
court
would've
said
that
even
that
constitutional
change
could
not
be
met.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
part
of
the
governmental
apparatus
in
california.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
i
--
i
haven't
read
the
hill
case,
the
hill
case
which
was
referred
to
the
brief,
the
third
case.
but
i
understand
the
reasoning
of
the
court
at
least,
and
the
result
on
that
case,
it
indicates
that
the
california
courts
rather
accepted
your
argument
about
repeal
of
the
two
earlier

because
there,
since
there
had
never
been

statute,
they
said
there
could
be
a
private

am
i
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
explain
the
hill
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that's
--
and
you
say
that's
notwithstanding,
the
purpose
as
expressed
you
say
in
official
document
has
doubtfully
elected
during
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
--
i
don't
follow
you
mr.
selvin.
why
--
why
think
the
silence
of
the
california
supreme
court
has
some
significance
as
to
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wirin?
justice
potter
stewart
under
california
law,
who
prepares
these
valid
arguments?
justice
potter
stewart
the
secretary
of
state
designates
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
perhaps
the
drafters
of
the
arguments
on
both
sides?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
they're
subject
to
any
editorial
supervision
by
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
so
anybody
can
say
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
so
once
designated
by
the
secretary
of
state,
the
drafter
of
these
arguments
can
say
anything
he
wants
--
he'd
want
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
even
though
it's
a

justice
potter
stewart
even
though
it
takes
liberties
with
the

what
the

justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice

actually
does.
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
what
the
voters
were
told?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
wirin
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
26,
if
you
agreed
that
it
did
nothing
more
than
repeal
the
provisions
of
the

acts
actions
you've
been
talking

would
you
be
here?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
shelley
and
kraemer?
justice
potter
stewart
which
it
did
in
shelley
and
kraemer
because
it
didn't
--
any
of
the
policy
or
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
a
private

justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wirin,
i
was
trying
to
help
you
in
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
in
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
wirin,
what
if
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
supreme
court
of
california
say
that
the
people
of
california
as
a
super
legislature
had
done
when
it
enacted
26?
in
other
words,
how
did
it
construe
26?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
please.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
would
as
i
read
the
briefs.
justice
potter
stewart
if
by
referendum,
they
put
it
into
a
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
if
the
people
put
it
into
a
statute
only
the
people
could
change
it
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wirin.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
prompted
by
what
i
read
in
the
reply
brief
with
petitioners,
the
bottom
of
page
6
and
the
top
of
page
7
and
i
understand
the
answer
to
your
question,
you
tell
me
that
that
--
that
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
misrepresented
this
to
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioners,
the
bottom
of
page
6
and
the
top
of
page
7
which
says
that
--
it's
quotes
--
it
quotes
--
it
quotes
article
4,
section
1
of
the
california
constitution
and
it
receives
to
say,
“accordingly
had
to
measure
--
propose
a
statute
rather
than
amendments
in
the
california
constitution.”
it
could
still
be
repealed
or
modified
only
by
both
or
the
people.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
an
initiative,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
change.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
what
possible
difference
that
makes
to
the
federal
constitutional
issue
that's
before
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
the
--
whether
california
has
acted
through
its
legislature,
through
initiative
of
its
people,
through
its
courts,
through
some
political
subdivision,
if
that
action
violates
federal
constitution,
it
violates
it,
and
if
it
doesn't,
it
doesn't.
i
don't
see
what
possible
difference
it
makes,
what
instrumentality
of
the
state
that
it
is
acting
through.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn't
you
have
exactly
the
same
argument,
the
--
the
federal
constitutional
argument
if
the
--
if
section
26
had
been
enacted
by
the
california
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
why,
but
if
you
think
you
have,
why?
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general.
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
--
if
i
understand
your
argument
correctly,
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
mistaken,
it
would
be
substantially
the
same
argument
even
if
there
had
been
--
never
been
a
rumford
or
an
unruh
act,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
no
state
could
do
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
regardless
of
its
prior
legislative
enactments.
and
if
this
--
that
the
enactment
of
this
constitutional
provision
in
and
of
itself
quite
apart
for
many
previous
history
of
what
the
state
had
or
had
not
enacted
in
this
area
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i
thought
that
your
argument
would
be
substantially
the
same
argument
if
the
--
if
there
had
never
been
any
statutes
weren't
passed
in
this
area
by
a
state
and
if
the
common
law
had
been
the
way
--
the
conventional
common
law
has
been
with
the
exception
of
your
(inaudible)
case
and
a
couple
others.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
common
law
generally
had
been
(inaudible)
that
it
would
still
--
that
the
affirmative
adoption
by
a
state
of
section
26
would
nonetheless
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
believe
i
was
correct
in
understanding
if
that
is
your
basic
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
point
apart
from
any
--
the
prior
history
of
any
rumford
act
or
unruh
act
or
anything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
think
on
analysis
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
your
basic
position
is
that
whether
this
26
had
been
adopted
by
california
with
its
particular
history
or
by
north
dakota,
or
by
ohio,
or
by
mississippi,
or
by
any
other
state
it
would
be
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
understood.
and
i
--
i
want
you
to
--
these
are
not
rhetorical
questions.
i'm
asking
for
information
so
i'd
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
think
you
--
as
i
had
understood
your
argument,
mr.
pruitt,
it
was
that
nothing
in
here
and
obviously
nothing
in
here
does
and
quite
obviously
nothing
in
here
could
take
away
from
the
courts
their
duty
to
apply
the
federal
constitution.
i
think
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
between
you
and
my
brother
fortas
which
--
that
you
were
talking
about,
the
federal
constitution
and
he
--
he
thought
you're
talking
about
the
state
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
obviously
there's
a
change
in
this
--
in
this
(inaudible)
--
this
is
an
addition
to
the
state
constitution
and
insofar
as
its
provisions,
do
not
violate
the
federal
constitution
the
state
courts
are
bound
by
it.
but
you're
quite
right
insofar
as
this
does
violate
the
federal
constitution
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
state
judges
have
the
duty
of
following
the
federal
constitution
(inaudible)
