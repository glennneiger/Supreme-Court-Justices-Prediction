justice
hugo
l.
black
a
right
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
god,
that
i
may
be
wrong.
in
fact,
all
you
said
just
simply
state
that
the
state
here
has
adopted
its
policy,
a
state
policy,
in
a
way
that
is
a
valid
method
of
providing
as
a
person
who
owns
a
piece
of
a
real
estate
to
sell
it
to
anyone
he'd
choose
was
on
his
own
terms
without
regard
to
race.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
policy
does
not
validate
federal
constitutions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
that
it'd
violate
the
provision
which
says
no
state
could
pass
a
law
denying
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying,
yeah,
they
haven't
passed
any
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that'd
declare
a
policy
that
a
person
can
sell
to
anyone
he
chooses
on
his
own
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wasn't
thinking
about
the
common-law.
i
was
thinking
about
the
fact
that
the
state
did
enact
after
the
policy.
a
state
can
enact
policies,
but
sometimes,
by
common-law,
which
is
legislation
by
the
courts
or
by
action
by
legislation.
what
you
are
saying
is,
they've
established
the
state
policy
if
they
can
do
it.
that
--
but
any
individual
who
owns
real
estate
can
sell
or
you
say
here,
rent,
(inaudible)
such
person
as
he
see
it
fit.
he
doesn't
have
to
take
in
regard
this
policy,
as
the
state
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
not
a
law
which
forbids
him
or
which
coerces
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there's
one
other
thing
in
your
argument,
as
i
suppose,
is
that
the

no
more
the
legislative

can
challenge

invalidate
a
state
-elected

justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
absence
of
a
violation

justice
hugo

black
that
is
if
they
were
submitted

justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
yes,
it
was.
and
--
and
the
vote
in
favor
of
it
was,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
overwhelming.
it
was.
but
just
as
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
compelled
california
to
pass
any
law
in
regard
to
that
amendment?
but
can
it
rest
on
what
it
has
to
do
under
that
amendment
alone.
like
it's
one
point.
justice
hugo
l.

that
is
if
it
doesn't
--
that
they
express
their
desire
not
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
is
an
official
policy
against
--
to
protect
people
to
sell
their
properties
to
whomsoever
they
please
without
regard
to
race.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
prohibit
that
except,
find
that
within
their
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
prohibit
that,
why
doesn't
the
state
have
the
right
to
proceed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
just
--
that
just
prohibits
the
state
from
involving
policy
which
says,
we'll
have
no
part
of
it,
either
way
we
will
act
only
in
court,
go
justice
for,
and
no
further
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
--
you
file
that
too
quickly
on
your
--
as
your
conclusion.
i
think,
too
quickly.
what
the
state
has
said
is
we're
going
to
adapt
to
policy
on
this
purpose.
it
will
be
that
we
don't
have
no
policy
of
value,
except
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
compels.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
fourteenth
amendment
say
that
it
said
there
that
no
state
shall
have
the
right
to
discriminate
on
the
ground
of
race,
no
person
in
any
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
say
if
it
refrains
from
involving
itself
in
it
that
it
should
be
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
need
to
authorize,
since
then
we'll
just
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
the
state
won't
prosecute
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
do
you
say
it
removed
the
jurisdiction
in
the
california
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
it
removed
the
jurisdiction
of
the
california
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
relieve
them
from
it,
if
the
federal
constitution
forbids
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
that
was
in
court
--
federal
--
the
state
court
have
(inaudible)
to
force
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
state
power,
but
not
--
not
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
abridgement
of
what?
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
no,
the
state
of
the
law
is
the
federal
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
you
can
get
back
in
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
yeah,
every
argument
you
have
is
why
this
violates
the
federal
amendment,
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
loose
way
of
saying.
does
it
--
does
it
mean
that
the
state
has
taken
action
by
writing
a
law
which
tells
the
people
that
they
are
free
both
from
the
state
and
federal
government
of
enforcing,
the
--
the
right
of
--
against
self
discrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
against
it
--
it's
told
the
individual
as
if
they're
free
to
sell
according
to
their
own
wishes
without
regard
to
color
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
whole
state
it
should
do
it.
it
said
that
individually.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
can't
say
it
if
it
wants
to
remain
inert.
we
want
to
remain
inert,
we're
going
to
pass
no
law
that
will
--
that
we
will
enforce
and
this
to
you,
on
the
basis
of
the
state
of
florida.
that
leaves
it
pretty
inert,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
if
it
does
that's
settled,
to
skip
the
federal
constitution,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
i
--
we
certainly
are
concluding
by
the
interpretation
of
26,
given
26
by
the
california
supreme
court,
are
we
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
mr.
wirin,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
that
constitutional
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
didn't
affect
the
race?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
--
are
you
attacking
the
right
of
california
to
allow
its
people
to
have
a
vote,
one
person
one
vote,
to
declare
a
state
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not
attacking
--
you
are
not
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
that
as
the
--
within
--
within
the
power
of
state
to
do
--
to
declare
its
policy,
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
get
back
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
get
back
to
the
point,
do
you
not
that
everybody
has
to
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
federal
constitution
prevents
california
from
doing
what
it's
done
here?
federal
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
depend
on
the
method
that
it's
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
was
asking
you
that
question
because
so
you
seem
to
be
impliedly
attacking
california's
right
to
adopt
this
method
of
establishing
its
policy
if
it
wish
to
do
so
without
regard
to
its
federal
constitutionality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
you
would
have
less
because
here,
moving
in
the
direction
of
letting
the
people
of
the
state,
the
voters
of
the
state
establish
their
policy,
the
nearest
to
a
democracy
you
can
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wasn't
talking
about
progress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
talking
about
movement
towards
democracy,
to
the
--
get
as
near
as
you
can
to
letting
the
people
vote.
i'm
not
attacking
your
basic
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you're
making.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you've
gotten
off
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
point
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you're
impliedly
attacking
california's
method
of
letting
its
people
vote
to
establish
policies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
is
a
constitutional
provision.
are
you
against
constitutional
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
--
what's
the
bill
of
rights
or
the
constitutional
provision
to
limit
the
local
power
or
party
unit
to
pass
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
you,
if
it
violates
the
federal
constitution,
it's
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
violates
the
federal
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
because
it's
conducted
in
a
constitutional
measure,
the
chief
measure
of
protecting
the
liberties
of
the
people
of
any
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
they
can
have
that
law
but
they
can't
repeal
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
drawing
a
distinction
between
what
was
done
by
the
state
and
what
they
actually
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
perhaps
through
a
constitutional
method
(inaudible),
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
subject
to
the
federal
constitution
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
state
supreme
court
can
do
away
with
this
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
mr.
solicitor
general,
these
suits
were
brought
in
orange
county,
weren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right,
let's
take
the
orange
county.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
us
suppose
that
the
california
legislature
after
this
suit
was
instituted,
passed
a
statute
saying
that
the
courts
of
orange
country
shall
not
entertain
any
lawsuits
or
where
there
was
a
claim
of
--
for
relief
based
upon
the
refusal
of
a
property
owner
to
sell
or
rent
housing
to
the
plaintiff,
would
that
be
in
conflict
with
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
be
in
con
--
well,
i
would
say
--
i
was
kind
of
thinking
about
this
case.
[laughter]
was
that
--
would
that
be
a
conflict
with
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
--
i
think
i
asked
you
the
other
day,
i'm
not
sure
yesterday,
if
the
--
if
proposition
14
had
said
that
rumford
and
unruh
are
hereby
repealed
and
private
parties
are
authorized
to
discriminate.
would
you
--
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
example,
i
didn't
single
out
racial
discrimination.
i
just
said
that
people
are
authorized
to
discriminate
in
the
selling
of
their
house.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
think
you
have
to
take
that
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
it
--
do
you
think
if
--
if
that
statute
--
if
that
kind
of
a
proposition
was
invalid,
you
could
still
win
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
think
that
this
is
an
authorization
to
discriminate,
proposition
14?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
authorization
as
such
is
not
necessarily
invalid
as
argued.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
civil
right
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
the
say
when
they
have
--
by
the
due
process
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
have
a
right
to
be
free,
conduct
themselves
as
they
please
so
long
as
they
do
not
violate
some
law
enacted
to
prevent
or
--
or
aid
something.
(inaudible)
not
to
have
a
life,
liberty,
or
property
taken
away
without
due
process
except
by
due
process
of
law
which
means
the
law
of
the
land.

a

don't
have
no
policy
of
value,
except
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
compels.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
fourteenth
amendment
say
that
it
said
there
that
no
state
shall
have
the
right
to
discriminate
on
the
ground
of
race,
no
person
in
any
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
say
if
it
refrains
from
involving
itself
in
it
that
it
should
be
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

need
to
authorize,
since
then
we'll
just
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
the
state
won't
prosecute
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
do
you
say
it
removed
the
jurisdiction
in
the
california
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
it
removed
the
jurisdiction
of
the
california
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
relieve
them
from
it,
if
the
federal
constitution
forbids
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
that
was
in
court
--
federal
--
the
state
court
have
(inaudible)
to
force
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
state
power,
but
not
--
not
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
abridgement
of
what?
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
no,
the
state
of
the
law
is
the
federal
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
you
can
get
back
in
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
yeah,
every
argument
you
have
is
why
this
violates
the
federal
amendment,
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
loose
way
of
saying.
does
it
--
does
it
mean
that
the
state
has
taken
action
by
writing
a
law
which
tells
the
people
that
they
are
free
both
from
the
state
and
federal
government
of
enforcing,
the
--
the
right
of
--
against
self
discrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
against
it
--
it's
told
the
individual
as
if
they're
free
to
sell
according
to
their
own
wishes
without
regard
to
color
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
whole
state
it
should
do
it.
it
said
that
individually.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
can't
say
it
if
it
wants
to
remain
inert.
we
want
to
remain
inert,
we're
going
to
pass
no
law
that
will
--
that
we
will
enforce
and
this
to
you,
on
the
basis
of
the
state
of
florida.
that
leaves
it
pretty
inert,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
if
it
does
that's
settled,
to
skip
the
federal
constitution,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
i
--
we
certainly
are
concluding
by
the
interpretation
of
26,
given
26
by
the
california
supreme
court,
are
we
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
mr.
wirin,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
that
constitutional
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
didn't
affect
the
race?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
--
are
you
attacking
the
right
of
california
to
allow
its
people
to
have
a
vote,
one
person
one
vote,
to
declare
a
state
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not
attacking
--
you
are
not
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
that
as
the
--
within
--
within
the
power
of
state
to
do
--
to
declare
its
policy,
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
get
back
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
get
back
to
the
point,
do
you
not
that
everybody
has
to
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
federal
constitution
prevents
california
from
doing
what
it's
done
here?
federal
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
depend
on
the
method
that
it's
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
was
asking
you
that
question
because
so
you
seem
to
be
impliedly
attacking
california's
right
to
adopt
this
method
of
establishing
its
policy
if
it
wish
to
do
so
without
regard
to
its
federal
constitutionality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
you
would
have
less
because
here,
moving
in
the
direction
of
letting
the
people
of
the
state,
the
voters
of
the
state
establish
their
policy,
the
nearest
to
a
democracy
you
can
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wasn't
talking
about
progress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
talking
about
movement
towards
democracy,
to
the
--
get
as
near
as
you
can
to
letting
the
people
vote.
i'm
not
attacking
your
basic
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you're
making.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you've
gotten
off
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
point
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you're
impliedly
attacking
california's
method
of
letting
its
people
vote
to
establish
policies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
is
a
constitutional
provision.
are
you
against
constitutional
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
--
what's
the
bill
of
rights
or
the
constitutional
provision
to
limit
the
local
power
or
party
unit
to
pass
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
you,
if
it
violates
the
federal
constitution,
it's
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
violates
the
federal
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
because
it's
conducted
in
a
constitutional
measure,
the
chief
measure
of
protecting
the
liberties
of
the
people
of
any
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
they
can
have
that
law
but
they
can't
repeal
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
drawing
a
distinction
between
what
was
done
by
the
state
and
what
they
actually
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
perhaps
through
a
constitutional
method
(inaudible),
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
subject
to
the
federal
constitution
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
state
supreme
court
can
do
away
with
this
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
mr.
solicitor
general,
these
suits
were
brought
in
orange
county,
weren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right,
let's
take
the
orange
county.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
us
suppose
that
the
california
legislature
after
this
suit
was
instituted,
passed
a
statute
saying
that
the
courts
of
orange
country
shall
not
entertain
any
lawsuits
or
where
there
was
a
claim
of
--
for
relief
based
upon
the
refusal
of
a
property
owner
to
sell
or
rent
housing
to
the
plaintiff,
would
that
be
in
conflict
with
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
be
in
con
--
well,
i
would
say
--
i
was
kind
of
thinking
about
this
case.
[laughter]
was
that
--
would
that
be
a
conflict
with
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
--
i
think
i
asked
you
the
other
day,
i'm
not
sure
yesterday,
if
the
--
if
proposition
14
had
said
that
rumford
and
unruh
are
hereby
repealed
and
private
parties
are
authorized
to
discriminate.
would
you
--
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
example,
i
didn't
single
out
racial
discrimination.
i
just
said
that
people
are
authorized
to
discriminate
in
the
selling
of
their
house.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
think
you
have
to
take
that
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
it
--
do
you
think
if
--
if
that
statute
--
if
that
kind
of
a
proposition
was
invalid,
you
could
still
win
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
think
that
this
is
an
authorization
to
discriminate,
proposition
14?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
authorization
as
such
is
not
necessarily
invalid
as
argued.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
civil
right
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
the
say
when
they
have
--
by
the
due
process
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
have
a
right
to
be
free,
conduct
themselves
as
they
please
so
long
as
they
do
not
violate
some
law
enacted
to
prevent
or
--
or
aid
something.
(inaudible)
not
to
have
a
life,
liberty,
or
property
taken
away
without
due
process
except
by
due
process
of
law
which
means
the
law
of
the
land.
