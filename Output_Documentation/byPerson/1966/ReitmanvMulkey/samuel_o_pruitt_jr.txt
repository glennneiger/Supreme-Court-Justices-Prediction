mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
in
response
to
several
questions
from
the
court,
it
seems
to
be
clear
that
the
risk
of
being
presumptuous
that
is
the
duty
of
this
court
to
read
this
measure
in
a
way
to
say
that's
validity
not
in
a
--
with
unfriendly
way
in
an
effort
to
read
in
--
into
it
some
provision
that
is
not
reasonably
implied.
for
example,
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
this
measure
that
can
reasonably
be
read
that
says
that
the
state
courts
in
california
are
prohibited
by
this
measure
from
performing
their
constitutional
duty
to
enforce
federal
rights,
whether
they
arise
under
a
federal
statute
or
under
the
federal
constitution.
nor
indeed
as
evidenced
by
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
state
courts
in
these
cases,
does
it
deprive
the
state
courts
of
the
obligation
to
entertain
claims
which
might
involve
the
rule
of
law
set
forth
in
section
26
to
interpret
that
rule
of
law
and
to
apply
it
to
the
effects
of
the
case
before
it.
and
i
think
it's
quite
ironic.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
language
i
think
establishes
a
rule
of
law
in
california.
rules
of
law
are
applied
by
courts
all
the
time.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
restatement
--
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it's
binding
--
it's
binding
on
the
courts
in
the
sense
that
the
courts
ought
to
apply
the
rule
law
that's
provided
for
on
this
measure.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
prohibits
the
--
it
tries
to
prohibit
the
court
from
applying
a
rule
of
law
different
than
the
one
recited
in
the
provision,
that's
true,
but
that's
true
of
any
statute
held
the
court
that
under
particular
circumstances
this
is
what
the
law
is.
and
a
court
is
obligated
to
apply
that
rule
of
law
unless
it
violates
some
constitutional
provisions.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
certainly,
and
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
court
below
attempted
to
deal
in
this
case
we
think
erroneously
but
it
certainly
attempted
to
do
what
it
thought
it
would
require
to
do
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
would
disagree,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it
tells
them
what
the
rule
of
law
is,
that
the
facts
that
--
that
rule
of
law
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
might
also
say
mr.
justice
fortas
that
with
respect
to
this
method
being
an
--
a
departure
from
the
ordinary
processes
of
government
in
california
or
to
placing
this
measure
in
the
california
constitution
has
a
significance
that
would
be
similar
to
an
amendment
to
federal
constitution,
for
example,
just
isn't
so.
this
is
a
normal
procedure
in
california.
our
constitution
has
been
amended
about
300
times
since
1879
by
initiative
and
other
procedures.
i
don't
say
it
isn't
necessarily
good
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
isn't
necessarily
bad
either.
now,
it's
quite
ironic,
i
think
that
the
respondents
in
this
case
supported
by
the
united
states
and
the
attorney
general
of
california
say,
“they
would
be
perfectly
valid
for
the
people
of
california
to
repeal
the
entire
unruh
act,
the
entire
rumford
act,”
presumably
to
repeal
all
of
our
antidiscrimination
laws
which
i
think
it's
been
conceded
the
state
had
no
obligation
to
enact
in
the
first
place.
here,
where
the
people
are
trying
to
affect
a
very
limited
repeal
of
only
one
tiny
portion
of
conduct
and
place
it
within
the
discretion
and
live
it
to
the
conscience
of
the
individuals,
that
they
say
violates
federal
constitution.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
have
considered
it
and
i
believe
i
did
cite
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i'll
say
that
i've
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
would
prefer
to
rely
on
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case,
you
honor,
which
i
think
reflects
to
the
current.
and
i'm
proud
to
rely
on
it,
i
might
say
because
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
certainly,
yes.
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
believe
they
address
themselves
to
this
point
and
i
believe
that
the
current
opinions
of
this
court
fully
support
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
and
mr.
justice
holmes
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
that
the
legislative
power
includes
the
right
of
the
state
to
decide
what
its
law
is
going
to
be
in
an
area
where
constitutional
rights
are
not
affected.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
in
that
case
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
i
regret
that,
your
honor
thinks
that
that's
what
this
measure
means
because
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
it's
a
fair
reading
of
it,
if
i
may
say
so.
and
further,
as
i
understand
the
holding
and
truax
v.
corrigan,
it
was
that
the
federal
constitution
prohibited
arizona
from
adopting
a
law
that
would
bar
the
remedy
of
injunctions
and
labor
disputes.
this
is
back
in
1924
and
if
--
if
that's
presently
the
constitutional
law
of
the
decisions
in
this
court
it
would
surprise
me
because
the
norris–la
guardia
act
in
the
federal
level
does
just
that
and
no
one,
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
has
challenged
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
as
i
say
the
reason
i
didn't
cite
the
majority
opinion
is
because
of
my
opinion
it's
not
currently
of
the
law.
now
with
respect
to
whether
the
california
court
made
any
factual
determination
of
encouragement,
mr.
wirin
read
a
portion
of
a
sentence
from
the
opinion
but
he
left
out
the
phrase
which
i
think
establishes
that
really
the
california
supreme
court
was
making
a
statement
of
a
legal
conclusion.
there
is
the
statement
mr.
wirin
read,
“here,
the
state
has
affirmatively
acted
to
change
its
existing
law
from
a
situation
where
in
a
discrimination
practice
was
legally
restricted
to
one
where
in
it
is
encouraged,”
and
this
is
the
part
that
was
omitted,
“within
the
meaning
of
the
cited
decisions.”
but
i
think
that's
clearly
a
legal
conclusion
as
to
what
this
court
meant
by
encouragement
in
such
decisions
as
burton
v.
wilmington
parking
authority,
the
robinson
v.
florida,
and
another
cases
cited
in
the
opinion.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
--
it
is
a
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
that's
all
it
means
with
this
exception,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
that
is
it's
in
our
constitution
that
it
reserves
to
the
people
the
power
to
enact
the
statute
in
the
future.
now
if
that
aspect
of
it
is
valid
and
we
think
it
clearly
is
then
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
repealer.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
my
analysis
indicates
that
its
interpretation
was
that
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
nullification
of
this
statute
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
the
only
thing
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
i
assume
the
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
i'm
right
or
they're
right
as
to
what
the
california
supreme
court
held.
and
i
think,
an
analysis
of
that
decision
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well
i
think
they
did,
your
honor.
if
you
read
their
decision
in
the
light
of
hill
v.
miller
where
they
say
in
california
there
is
no
right
of
action
under
these
circumstances
unless
there's
a
statute.
even
though
in
that
case
the
landlord
was
very
obliging
in
putting
his
notice
termination
that
he
was
relying
specifically
on
the
right
given
to
him
by
section
26
to
terminate
for
this
tenancy.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
they
described
what
happened
as
the
sequence
of
legislative
activity
and
they
say
this
change
of
policy
constitutes
encouragement
of
racial
discrimination.
they
said
that.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
think
the
singling
out
of
discrimination
in
any
official
statute
might
raise
a
serious
constitutional
problem,
just
as
your
honor
thought
there
was
a
serious
problem
in
the
georgia
statute
in
evans
v.
newton
because
it
singled
out
in
your
honor's
opinion,
racial
discrimination
as
permissible
conduct
brought
at
the
same
time
living
in
doubt
whether
you
can
discriminate
on
any
other
grounds
but
race.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
would
be
perfectly
valid.
i
--
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
because
i
think
the
constitutional
issue
here
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it's
an
authorization
to
act
without
the
compulsion
of
government.
now,
that's
an
authorization
to
discriminate,
that
maybe
a
way
of
putting
it
but
it's
not
an
encouragement
to
discriminate.
it's
an
encouragement
to
act
on
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
your
conscience,
which
is
true
of
all
areas
of
conduct
which
the
government
either
commands,
not
be
--
neither
commands
to
be
done
nor
prohibits
from
being
done.
this
broad
middle
ground
where
the
government
does
nothing
so
to
speak,
neither
prohibits
it
nor
does
it
command
it.
in
those
areas,
freedom
means
that
people
are
supposed
to
act
in
accordance
with
their
consciences
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
don't
discriminate.
but
it
includes,
that's
one
of
curse
of
freedom
is
that
some
people
will.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that's
what
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that's
what
this
measure
says.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well
in
the
form
of
your
honor's
question,
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
such
a
case
of
a
statute
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
that
was
designed
to
circumvent
the
right
not
to
be
discriminated?
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
know
--
i
know
of
such
case
that
holds
it
on
this
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
but
then
i
was
going
to
say
mr.
justice
black
that
the
whole
--
the
whole
line
of
authorities
from
the
civil
rights
cases
down
to
the
guest
case
last
term,
in
making
the
distinction
between
state
and
private
actions
seems
to
make
crystal
clear
that
a
state
has
an
absolute
right
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
say
this
is
the
kind
of
conduct
we
can
prevent
if
we
think
it's
necessary
or
desirable.
we
don't
have
to
do
it
in
the
federal
constitution.
and
if
we
decide
not
to
take
a
position
on
this
kind
of
field
--
in
this
field,
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
says
we
cannot.
now
let's
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
think
the
central,
the
core
question
in
this
case,
chief
justice
please,
is
whether
this
rule
of
law
is
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
in
1959,
everybody
says
that
california
just
had
the
common
law
rule
and
it
wasn't
printed
in
the
statute
so
it
wasn't
in
the
constitution.
there
would
be
no
federal
constitutional
question
if
the
court
rendered
judgment
for
the
property
owners
in
this
case.
now
in
1967,
all
of
sudden
that
same
rule
of
law
raises
a
serious
constitutional
question.
now,
why
is
that
so?
why
should
it
make
a
difference
that
california
has
experimented
in
this
field
by
adopting
a
statute
to
see
whether
or
not
it
would
assist
in
the
situation,
the
people
say
we
don't
want
the
statute
and
they
repealed
it.
why
should
that
conduct
of
the
legislative
groups
in
california
make
it
any
different
constitutional
question
than
it
would
have
been
in
1959?
or
for
that
matter,
any
difference
in
the
constitutional
question
should
these
cases
come
up
from
illinois
or
texas
or
mississippi?
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
of
constitutional
law
applicable
to
california?
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
ironic
to
suggest
that
a
repeal
of
these
measures,
which
is
a
much
more
drastic
step,
from
the
step
that
people
took
here.
they
didn't
repeal
the
unruh
act.
it
prohibits
discrimination
on
racial
or
religious
grounds
in
business
establishments
of
every
kind
whatsoever.
my
opponents
here
say
that
california
can
repeal
that
whole
law,
consistent
with
the
federal
constitution.
but
what
they
can't
do
is
the
(inaudible)
of
that
law,
this
narrow
area
of
conduct
for
a
private
property
on.
i
find
that
very
ironic
and
unacceptable
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
again,
that's
not
what
this
measure
says.
it
says
it
can
pass
such
a
law
when
the
people
pass
it
in
that
part
of
the
process
of
the
democratic
government
in
california.
i
know
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
says
that
kind
of
a
democratic
process
is
prohibited.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
disagree
with
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
doesn't
create
any
right
of
any
kind,
your
honor.
it
recognizes
a
rule
of
law
which
was
created
many
years
ago
by
--
and
it's
reported
in
black
stones
commentary
and
approved
by
this
court.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
constitutional
right
in
the
sense
of
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
they
have
a
state
constitutional
right
in
the
sense
that
they
may
--
they
act
in
that
manner
until
and
unless
a
valid
statute
prohibits
them
from
doing
so.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
certainly
my
understanding,
mr
justice
black,
and
i
think
it
was
stated
by
this
court
long
ago
as
buchanan
v.
warley
in
about
1917
insofar
as
i
know
has
not
been
changed.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes,
the
initiative
applied
both
to
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
constitutional
amendments
and
the
legislative
acts,
but
either
one
is
modifiable
in
the
future
only
by
further
action
of
the
people.
for
the
fact
that
this
is
in
the
california
constitution
by
initiative
as
distinguished
from
the
california
statute
by
initiative
has
no
bearing
on
who
has
the
right
repeal
it.
effect
in
short,
if
the
court
pleased
that
the
court
below
exercised
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
to
strike
down
a
rule
of
law
which
the
people
of
california
adopted
in
the
orderly
manner
of
democracy
which
we
practice
there.
we
asked
the
court
not
to
exercise
that
power
to
overrule
the
judgment
of
the
people
here.
the
people
are
the
only
sorts
for
the
ultimate
and
abiding
solution
of
the
kind
of
problem
that's
been
raised
by
my
opposition.
and
if
these
arguments
that
they
are
addressing
to
this
court
or
addressed
to
the
legislative
bodies
in
california
for
the
people,
they
are
the
ones
that
have
to
be
convinced
that
their
method
of
approach
to
this
problem
is
preferable
to
the
one
adopted
by
the
people.
we
ask
that
the
judgments
be
reversed.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
in
response
to
several
questions
from
the
court,
it
seems
to
be
clear
that
the
risk
of
being
presumptuous
that
is
the
duty
of
this
court
to
read
this
measure
in
a
way
to
say
that's
validity
not
in
a
--
with
unfriendly
way
in
an
effort
to
read
in
--
into
it
some
provision
that
is
not
reasonably
implied.
for
example,
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
this
measure
that
can
reasonably
be
read
that
says
that
the
state
courts
in
california
are
prohibited
by
this
measure
from
performing
their
constitutional
duty
to
enforce
federal
rights,
whether
they
arise
under
a
federal
statute
or
under
the
federal
constitution.
nor
indeed
as
evidenced
by
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
state
courts
in
these
cases,
does
it
deprive
the
state
courts
of
the
obligation
to
entertain
claims
which
might
involve
the
rule
of
law
set
forth
in
section
26
to
interpret
that
rule
of
law
and
to
apply
it
to
the
effects
of
the
case
before
it.
and
i
think
it's
quite
ironic.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
language
i
think
establishes
a
rule
of
law
in
california.
rules
of
law
are
applied
by
courts
all
the
time.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
restatement
--
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it's
binding
--
it's
binding
on
the
courts
in
the
sense
that
the
courts
ought
to
apply
the
rule
law
that's
provided
for
on
this
measure.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
prohibits
the
--
it
tries
to
prohibit
the
court
from
applying
a
rule
of
law
different
than
the
one
recited
in
the
provision,
that's
true,
but
that's
true
of
any
statute
held
the
court
that
under
particular
circumstances
this
is
what
the
law
is.
and
a
court
is
obligated
to
apply
that
rule
of
law
unless
it
violates
some
constitutional
provisions.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
certainly,
and
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
court
below
attempted
to
deal
in
this
case
we
think
erroneously
but
it
certainly
attempted
to
do
what
it
thought
it
would
require
to
do
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
would
disagree,
mr.
justice
fortas.
it
tells
them
what
the
rule
of
law
is,
that
the
facts
that
--
that
rule
of
law
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
might
also
say
mr.
justice
fortas
that
with
respect
to
this
method
being
an
--
a
departure
from
the
ordinary
processes
of
government
in
california
or
to
placing
this
measure
in
the
california
constitution
has
a
significance
that
would
be
similar
to
an
amendment
to
federal
constitution,
for
example,
just
isn't
so.
this
is
a
normal
procedure
in
california.
our
constitution
has
been
amended
about
300
times
since
1879
by
initiative
and
other
procedures.
i
don't
say
it
isn't
necessarily
good
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
isn't
necessarily
bad
either.
now,
it's
quite
ironic,
i
think
that
the
respondents
in
this
case
supported
by
the
united
states
and
the
attorney
general
of
california
say,
“they
would
be
perfectly
valid
for
the
people
of
california
to
repeal
the
entire
unruh
act,
the
entire
rumford
act,”
presumably
to
repeal
all
of
our
antidiscrimination
laws
which
i
think
it's
been
conceded
the
state
had
no
obligation
to
enact
in
the
first
place.
here,
where
the
people
are
trying
to
affect
a
very
limited
repeal
of
only
one
tiny
portion
of
conduct
and
place
it
within
the
discretion
and
live
it
to
the
conscience
of
the
individuals,
that
they
say
violates
federal
constitution.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
have
considered
it
and
i
believe
i
did
cite
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i'll
say
that
i've
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
would
prefer
to
rely
on
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case,
you
honor,
which
i
think
reflects
to
the
current.
and
i'm
proud
to
rely
on
it,
i
might
say
because
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
certainly,
yes.
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
believe
they
address
themselves
to
this
point
and
i
believe
that
the
current
opinions
of
this
court
fully
support
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
and
mr.
justice
holmes
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
that
the
legislative
power
includes
the
right
of
the
state
to
decide
what
its
law
is
going
to
be
in
an
area
where
constitutional
rights
are
not
affected.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
in
that
case
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
i
regret
that,
your
honor
thinks
that
that's
what
this
measure
means
because
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
it's
a
fair
reading
of
it,
if
i
may
say
so.
and
further,
as
i
understand
the
holding
and
truax
v.
corrigan,
it
was
that
the
federal
constitution
prohibited
arizona
from
adopting
a
law
that
would
bar
the
remedy
of
injunctions
and
labor
disputes.
this
is
back
in
1924
and
if
--
if
that's
presently
the
constitutional
law
of
the
decisions
in
this
court
it
would
surprise
me
because
the
norris–la
guardia
act
in
the
federal
level
does
just
that
and
no
one,
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
has
challenged
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
as
i
say
the
reason
i
didn't
cite
the
majority
opinion
is
because
of
my
opinion
it's
not
currently
of
the
law.
now
with
respect
to
whether
the
california
court
made
any
factual
determination
of
encouragement,
mr.
wirin
read
a
portion
of
a
sentence
from
the
opinion
but
he
left
out
the
phrase
which
i
think
establishes
that
really
the
california
supreme
court
was
making
a
statement
of
a
legal
conclusion.
there
is
the
statement
mr.
wirin
read,
“here,
the
state
has
affirmatively
acted
to
change
its
existing
law
from
a
situation
where
in
a
discrimination
practice
was
legally
restricted
to
one
where
in
it
is
encouraged,”
and
this
is
the
part
that
was
omitted,
“within
the
meaning
of
the
cited
decisions.”
but
i
think
that's
clearly
a
legal
conclusion
as
to
what
this
court
meant
by
encouragement
in
such
decisions
as
burton
v.
wilmington
parking
authority,
the
robinson
v.
florida,
and
another
cases
cited
in
the
opinion.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
--
it
is
a
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
that's
all
it
means
with
this
exception,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
that
is
it's
in
our
constitution
that
it
reserves
to
the
people
the
power
to
enact
the
statute
in
the
future.
now
if
that
aspect
of
it
is
valid
and
we
think
it
clearly
is
then
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
repealer.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
my
analysis
indicates
that
its
interpretation
was
that
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
nullification
of
this
statute
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
the
only
thing
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
i
assume
the
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
i'm
right
or
they're
right
as
to
what
the
california
supreme
court
held.
and
i
think,
an
analysis
of
that
decision
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well
i
think
they
did,
your
honor.
if
you
read
their
decision
in
the
light
of
hill
v.
miller
where
they
say
in
california
there
is
no
right
of
action
under
these
circumstances
unless
there's
a
statute.
even
though
in
that
case
the
landlord
was
very
obliging
in
putting
his
notice
termination
that
he
was
relying
specifically
on
the
right
given
to
him
by
section
26
to
terminate
for
this
tenancy.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
they
described
what
happened
as
the
sequence
of
legislative
activity
and
they
say
this
change
of
policy
constitutes
encouragement
of
racial
discrimination.
they
said
that.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
think
the
singling
out
of
discrimination
in
any
official
statute
might
raise
a
serious
constitutional
problem,
just
as
your
honor
thought
there
was
a
serious
problem
in
the
georgia
statute
in
evans
v.
newton
because
it
singled
out
in
your
honor's
opinion,
racial
discrimination
as
permissible
conduct
brought
at
the
same
time
living
in
doubt
whether
you
can
discriminate
on
any
other
grounds
but
race.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
would
be
perfectly
valid.
i
--
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
because
i
think
the
constitutional
issue
here
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it's
an
authorization
to
act
without
the
compulsion
of
government.
now,
that's
an
authorization
to
discriminate,
that
maybe
a
way
of
putting
it
but
it's
not
an
encouragement
to
discriminate.
it's
an
encouragement
to
act
on
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
your
conscience,
which
is
true
of
all
areas
of
conduct
which
the
government
either
commands,
not
be
--
neither
commands
to
be
done
nor
prohibits
from
being
done.
this
broad
middle
ground
where
the
government
does
nothing
so
to
speak,
neither
prohibits
it
nor
does
it
command
it.
in
those
areas,
freedom
means
that
people
are
supposed
to
act
in
accordance
with
their
consciences
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
don't
discriminate.
but
it
includes,
that's
one
of
curse
of
freedom
is
that
some
people
will.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that's
what
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that's
what
this
measure
says.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well
in
the
form
of
your
honor's
question,
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
such
a
case
of
a
statute
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
that
was
designed
to
circumvent
the
right
not
to
be
discriminated?
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
know
--
i
know
of
such
case
that
holds
it
on
this
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
but
then
i
was
going
to
say
mr.
justice
black
that
the
whole
--
the
whole
line
of
authorities
from
the
civil
rights
cases
down
to
the
guest
case
last
term,
in
making
the
distinction
between
state
and
private
actions
seems
to
make
crystal
clear
that
a
state
has
an
absolute
right
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
say
this
is
the
kind
of
conduct
we
can
prevent
if
we
think
it's
necessary
or
desirable.
we
don't
have
to
do
it
in
the
federal
constitution.
and
if
we
decide
not
to
take
a
position
on
this
kind
of
field
--
in
this
field,
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
says
we
cannot.
now
let's
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
think
the
central,
the
core
question
in
this
case,
chief
justice
please,
is
whether
this
rule
of
law
is
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
in
1959,
everybody
says
that
california
just
had
the
common
law
rule
and
it
wasn't
printed
in
the
statute
so
it
wasn't
in
the
constitution.
there
would
be
no
federal
constitutional
question
if
the
court
rendered
judgment
for
the
property
owners
in
this
case.
now
in
1967,
all
of
sudden
that
same
rule
of
law
raises
a
serious
constitutional
question.
now,
why
is
that
so?
why
should
it
make
a
difference
that
california
has
experimented
in
this
field
by
adopting
a
statute
to
see
whether
or
not
it
would
assist
in
the
situation,
the
people
say
we
don't
want
the
statute
and
they
repealed
it.
why
should
that
conduct
of
the
legislative
groups
in
california
make
it
any
different
constitutional
question
than
it
would
have
been
in
1959?
or
for
that
matter,
any
difference
in
the
constitutional
question
should
these
cases
come
up
from
illinois
or
texas
or
mississippi?
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
of
constitutional
law
applicable
to
california?
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
ironic
to
suggest
that
a
repeal
of
these
measures,
which
is
a
much
more
drastic
step,
from
the
step
that
people
took
here.
they
didn't
repeal
the
unruh
act.
it
prohibits
discrimination
on
racial
or
religious
grounds
in
business
establishments
of
every
kind
whatsoever.
my
opponents
here
say
that
california
can
repeal
that
whole
law,
consistent
with
the
federal
constitution.
but
what
they
can't
do
is
the
(inaudible)
of
that
law,
this
narrow
area
of
conduct
for
a
private
property
on.
i
find
that
very
ironic
and
unacceptable
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
again,
that's
not
what
this
measure
says.
it
says
it
can
pass
such
a
law
when
the
people
pass
it
in
that
part
of
the
process
of
the
democratic
government
in
california.
i
know
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
says
that
kind
of
a
democratic
process
is
prohibited.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
disagree
with
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
doesn't
create
any
right
of
any
kind,
your
honor.
it
recognizes
a
rule
of
law
which
was
created
many
years
ago
by
--
and
it's
reported
in
black
stones
commentary
and
approved
by
this
court.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
constitutional
right
in
the
sense
of
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
they
have
a
state
constitutional
right
in
the
sense
that
they
may
--
they
act
in
that
manner
until
and
unless
a
valid
statute
prohibits
them
from
doing
so.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
certainly
my
understanding,
mr
justice
black,
and
i
think
it
was
stated
by
this
court
long
ago
as
buchanan
v.
warley
in
about
1917
insofar
as
i
know
has
not
been
changed.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes,
the
initiative
applied
both
to
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
constitutional
amendments
and
the
legislative
acts,
but
either
one
is
modifiable
in
the
future
only
by
further
action
of
the
people.
for
the
fact
that
this
is
in
the
california
constitution
by
initiative
as
distinguished
from
the
california
statute
by
initiative
has
no
bearing
on
who
has
the
right
repeal
it.
effect
in
short,
if
the
court
pleased
that
the
court
below
exercised
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
to
strike
down
a
rule
of
law
which
the
people
of
california
adopted
in
the
orderly
manner
of
democracy
which
we
practice
there.
we
asked
the
court
not
to
exercise
that
power
to
overrule
the
judgment
of
the
people
here.
the
people
are
the
only
sorts
for
the
ultimate
and
abiding
solution
of
the
kind
of
problem
that's
been
raised
by
my
opposition.
and
if
these
arguments
that
they
are
addressing
to
this
court
or
addressed
to
the
legislative
bodies
in
california
for
the
people,
they
are
the
ones
that
have
to
be
convinced
that
their
method
of
approach
to
this
problem
is
preferable
to
the
one
adopted
by
the
people.
we
ask
that
the
judgments
be
reversed.
