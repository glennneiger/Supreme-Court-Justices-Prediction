chief

earl
warren
is
there
any
question
of
severability
here,
the
petition
here?
chief

earl

did
the
court
address
itself
any
--
in
its
opinion
to
the
question
of
severability?
chief

earl
warren
does
it
authorize
actions
of
property
owners
in
concert?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
you
mean
he
couldn't
have
--
under
this
section,
he
couldn't
agree
with
others
to
--
to
discriminate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
language
would
you
point
to
as
invalidating
that?
when
you
use
a
broad
language
as
you
do
in
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
the
rest
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
that
under
this
24
that
the
state
could
now
pass
a
statute
prohibiting
people
from
entering
into
respective
covenants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
for
this,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
possibly
go
down
the
drain
with
some
of
these
other
acts
that
we're
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
could
do
it
for
any
reason.
i
suppose
you
could
do
it
because
it
may
be
this
neighbor.
he
and
his
neighbor
agreed
that
they
didn't
want
--
they
didn't
want
negroes
in
that
neighborhood
and
that
would
be
one
--
be
one
of
his
reasons
for
wanting
to
do
it
or
he
could
do
it
for
two
or
three
or
any
number
probably.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
but
suppose
he
came
in
the
court
and
said,
no.
now,
the
reason
i
--
i
don't
want
to
sell
it
to
this
particular
person
is
because
i
live
in
this
neighborhood
and
my
--
my
neighbors
don't
want
negroes
in
the
neighborhood
and
i've
agreed
with
them
that
i
will
not
sell
mine
because
they
do
not
propose
to
sell
theirs
to
negroes.
did
the
--
could
the
state
prohibit
that
kind
of
conduct
under
this
24?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
selvin.
chief
justice

we'll
recess
now.

mr

chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
--
i
wonder
if
this
section
might
not
even
prevent
the
courts
or
agencies
of
the
state
from
cooperating
with
the
federal
government
in
the
event
of
an
open
housing
statute
because
it
says
neither
the
state
nor
any
subdivision
or
agency
thereof
shall
deny,
limit,
or
abridge
directly
or
indirectly
the
right
of
any
person
who
is
willing
and
decides
to
sell
and
so
forth.
now,
that
looks
to
me
like
a
pretty
strong
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
an
all-inclusive
statement
and
i
just
wonder
if
they
could
--
under
that
constitutional
section,
if
they
could
even
cooperate
with
the
federal
government
or
the
--
the
courts
enforce
federal
rights.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
so,
but
that
wouldn't
save
the
constitutionality
of
this
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
to
do
it,
the
supremacy
clause
probably
would
compel
them
to
do
it
but
isn't
this
an
attempt
to
even
to
go
that
far.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
would
at
least,
it
seems
to
me,
be
a
discouragement
to
any
--
any
agency
of
the
state
of
california
from
even
cooperating
with
the
federal
government
in
any
such
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pruitt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
you
have
to
say
that
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
legitimate,
some
acts
where
a
state
authorizes
something
to
be
done
to
say
that
it's
made
it
legal.
but
it's
not,
and
it
says
we're
not
going
to
have
any
law
on
this
subject.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
quite
different.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what's
--
what's
done
is
here
is
a
play
on
the
words
encourage
and
discourage.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
have
--
we
have
this
situation
and
i
wonder
if
you've
found
any
--
any
analogies
to
it
in
other
constitutions
that
have
been
sustained,
well
recognized
of
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments
were
--
were
designed
to
prevent
discrimination
of
the
negro.
now,
do
you
know
of
any
other
analogies
where
--
where
the
courts
have
sustained
a
statute
or
a
constitutional
provision
that
is
designed
to
circumvent
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
circumvent
the
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
to
prevent
discrimination
against
negroes.
it
is
true
that
it
only
operates
against
the
state
not
just
against
the
individuals.
but
do
you
know
of
any
other
constitutional
provision
or
statute
which
is
to
stand
by
this
court
or
higher
courts,
where
the
purpose
was
--
where
the
statute
itself
said
that
the
people,
affirmatively,
that
the
people
should
not
be
interfered
with
in
their
right
of
discrimination.
and
isn't
that
what
we
have
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
disagree
with
you
on
the
fact
that
they
can
--
can
do
nothing
about
it?but
can
they
encourage
--
encourage
it
by
a
provision
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
there
is
but
couldn't
they
--
couldn't
they
simply
have
repealed
the
rumford
and
the
unruh
amendments
here
and
let
it
go
with
that
and
then
the
state
would
be
neutral?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
it's
a
legislative
process
for
--
for
the
legislature
to
pass
and
repeal
laws.
that's
what
the
legislature
is
there
for.
but
does
that
follow?
the
state
has
the
right
to
say
that
it
no
longer
can
pass
a
law
that
is
in
furtherance
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
so
far
as
discrimination
is
concerned.
