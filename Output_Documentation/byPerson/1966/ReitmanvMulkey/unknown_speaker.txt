unknown
speaker
is
the
unruh
act
the
same
as
the
rumford
act?
unknown
speaker
was
the
rumford
act
reinstated
by
the
act
of
the
california
courts
in
invalidating
proposition
14?
unknown
speaker
so
that
this
discriminates
--
so
the
claim
on
the
other
side
is
not
that
these
discriminations
that
occurred
in
this
case
violate
the
constitution
of
the
untied
states
but
only
that
they
violate
the
rumford
act?
unknown
speaker
yes.
all
right.
unknown
speaker
but
it
says
that
the
the
--
that
even
if
there
were
some
constitutional
ramifications,
recovery
in
this
of
article
26,
they
were
so
acquired
that
the
invalid
part,
that
the
whole
article
26
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
severability.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
balance?
unknown
speaker
and
is
this
more
than
dealing
with
that?
unknown
speaker
what
--
part
one
or
two
is
actually
the
same?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
then
these
people
are
in
the
business
of
renting
a
space?
unknown
speaker
but
shelley
against
kraemer
was
a
free
choice
case,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the
--
if
there
was
this
common-law
rule
of
the
state
requiring
equal
service
in
hotels
and
restaurants
and
then
other
public
utilities
sort
of
situations?
and
that
that
you
came
along
and
said
that,
notwithstanding,
any
prior
cases
to
the
contrary,
private
discriminations
to
the
grounds
raise
are
hereby
authorized?
now,
that's
an
--
is
that
any
different
from
this
case,
and
if
it
is,
what
--
would
you
give
the
same
answer
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
that
--
but
you
say,
it's
also
in
--
in
a
way
with
the
prior
rule
which
was
--
unknown
speaker
--
that
private
discriminations
are
unauthorized.
unknown
speaker
private
discriminations
and
all
other
conduct
of
a
property
owner
are
--
or
any
government
regulation
or
are
authorized
for
whatever
reason
(inaudible).
i
don't
think
the
first
amendment
can
probably
be
termed
as
an
authorization
to
other
seditious
libel,
for
example.
and
yet,
our
--
our
opponents
here
say
that
this
is
a
measure
that
authorizes
racial
discrimination.
what
it
authorizes
is
freedom
of
the
property
owner
to
act
in
accordance
with
his
conscience,
whether
it'd
be
reasonable
or
arbitrary
or
otherwise,
accepting
only
as
prohibited
by
some
valid
legislation.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
the
first
amendment
authorizes
free
speech?
unknown
speaker
now,
with
respect
to
the
disposition
by
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
with
accommodations,
you'd
come
to
a
serious
question
of
federal
preemption
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
not
have
it
repealed.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
(inaudible)
section
26,
just
as
though
its
read
that
--
hereby
declare
that
the
underlying
unruh
act
is
hereby
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
do
think
that
--
do
you
think
the
california
supreme
court
decision
would've
(inaudible)
the
legislative
state
of
california
is
simply
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
or
are
you
saying
that
--
that
a
--
that
a
legislature
may
repeal
an
act
and
it
may
and
the
same
act
say,
type
of
discriminations
are
hereby
authorized.
unknown
speaker
when
did
california
pass
a
law
saying
that
no
apartment
has
to
be
sold
to
a
negro
owner,
investor?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
barrier,
the
constitutional
barrier?
unknown
speaker
it
is
also
says,
it
does
paralyze
the
government.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
--
let's
say
that
i
gather
this
--
this
is
an
argument
that
we
can
keep
the
question
before
as
--
as
if
there
were
no
unruh
act
and
if
there
were
no
rumford
act
at
all.
unknown
speaker
how
are
we
supposed
to
--
how
are
we
supposed
to
ascertain
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
ascertain
that
purpose
of
which
is
the
--
it
wasn't
what
it
was,
and
--
we
don't
get
it
from
supreme
court,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
but
this
--
this
wasn't
--
in
its
approach,
what
you're
thinking
now?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
you
admit
in
that
regard?
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
there
was
only
dissenting
opinion
in
your
favor
in
that
case,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
selvin,
if
somebody
brought
that
these
plaintiffs
had
brought
an
--
brought
an
action
after
this
constitutional
amendment
and
the
california
state
court
had
alleged
that
there
was
a
--
that
there
was
a
common-law
principle
that
gave
him
a
cause
of
action
on
account
of
a
racial
discrimination
here,
would
the
california
court
have
to
dismiss
the
action
at
threshold
because
it
was
constitutional
amendment?
assuming
that
constitutional
amendment
is
not
--
unknown
speaker
hmm?
unknown
speaker
yes,
--
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
not
i
suppose
--
not
i
suppose
second
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
pass
a
law
against
discrimination
in
housing
and
authorized
enforcement
in
the
state
courts
with
the
section
26
and
affect
that
situation.
unknown
speaker
unless
if
there
would
be
preemption
there.
but
apart
from
the
preemption
doctrine
is
at
the
thrust
of
the
section
26
--
do
you
agree
that
section
26
does
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
as
well
as
the
legislature
of
california.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
difficulty
that
i
have
is
that,
if
the
people
of
california
say
to
their
legislature,
if
there's
going
to
be
any
legislation
on
this
subject,
we're
going
to
exercise
that
power
through
the
process
of
constitutional
amendment.
now,
if
that
is
what
section
26
amounts
to,
that
is,
it
presents
some
very
difficult
problems
in
your
point
of
view,
obviously.
on
the
other
hand,
if
section
26,
is
a
direction
to
the
california
courts
to
that
--
yet
saying
in
effect
that
they
cannot
exercise
powers
which
they
would
otherwise
have.
so
it
might
be
that
that
is
a
very
different
kind
of
a
matter
because
it's
not
the
people
withdrawing
some
power
that
they
have
pro
tanto
with
growing
power
that
they
vested
in
the
legislature,
but
it
is
--
it
is
a
qualitatively,
a
different
matter,
at
least
this
is
argued
correctly.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
selvin,
could
i
just
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
all
that
you've
said
up
to
now
is
a
--
is
a
--
is
suggesting
the
less
that
we
affirm
on
the
grounds
used
by
the
--
by
the
california
court
or
do
you
say
that,
that
at
least
you
affirmed
one
of
the
grounds?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
some
of
them
are
grounds
that
the
california
court
is
not.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
that
involves
a
characterization
of
proposition
14
in
strictly
local
terms?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
those
are
factual
analysis
--
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
the
help
of
the
california's
court
zone.
unknown
speaker
to
prohibit
private
racial
discrimination
in
the
absence
of
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wirin,
may
(voice

unknown

is
the
