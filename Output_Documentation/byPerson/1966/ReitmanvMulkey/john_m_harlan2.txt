is
there
anything
in
section
26
(inaudible)
initiative,
the
referendum
in
the
opinion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
it
could
be
repealed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
difference
in
that
respect
is
there
--
this
is
a
legislative
act
of
the
constitution
(inaudible).
justice
john

on
the
constitution
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
noticed
you
don't
cite
in
your
brief
truax
versus
corrigan.
have
you
considered
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
find
it
in
your
index.
but
don't
bother
now,
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
distinguish
taft's
opinion
in
truax
v.
corrigan
from
this
case,
where
the
state
of
arizona
had
withheld
a
remedy
for
a
denial
by
private
people
of
equal
protection,
equal
treatment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
see,
the
dissenting
opinion,
it
doesn't
help
you.
there
were
three
of
them
and
i
just
refreshed
my
recollection
on
them.
they
don't
help
you
much
because
they
went
off
on
the
grounds
if
there
was
no
lack
of
equal
protection.
and
here
we
have
--
any
line
drawn
between
race
is
a
suspect
line
in
this
country.
that's
true
isn't
it,
by
the
reason
of
the
13th,
14th,
and
15th
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
think
the
dissenting
opinion
address
themselves
to
state
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
think
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
on
the
grounds
of
what
is
--
with
classifications,
yes,
making
a
classification.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

we
don't
have
that
problem
here
but
we
do
have
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
can
turn
over
its
--
the
municipal
function
of
zoning
to
a
real
estate
