mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
will,
i
think,
perhaps,
conduce
to
appropriate
analysis
of
the
issue
in
this
case,
if
we
stop
for
a
moment
to
see
just
what
it
is
that
section
26
does,
what
it
was
intended
to
do,
and
how
it
operates
to
accomplish
that
intention.
section
26,
is
not,
a
mere
declaration
of
policy
to
the
effect
that
owners
of
residential
property
may
deal
with
those
with
whom
they
please.
it
is
a
prohibition
upon
a
withdrawal
of
powers
of
state
government
to
deal
with
racial
discrimination
in
the
sale,
rental,
and
leasing
of
residential
property.
it
says
in
so
many
words,
that
neither
the
state
nor
any
its
agencies,
and
that
of
course
includes
the
legislature,
it
includes
the
courts,
it
includes
the
executive
branch,
but
not
the
people.
that
it
includes
the
people
acting
as
a
legislature,
but
not
as
a
constitutional
convention.
they
could
repeal
--
they
could
repeal
their
own
amendment
to
the
constitution
as
they
could
add
one.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
is.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
that
is
what
makes
section
26
the
clearest
example
of
state
action,
the
fact
that
it
is
legislation-adopted
by
use
of
the
apparatus
of
--
of
california
state
government.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
paralyzes
all
the
branches
of
but
except
the
people
acting
through
the
initiative
or
perhaps,
well,
through
the
initiative,
because
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
a
referendum
if
the
legislature
is
paralyzed.
it
does
not
paralyze
--
it
does
not
stop
that.
but
let
me
--
let
me
say
this
on
the
side
for
that.
the
possibility
that
some
statute
or
some
state
constitutional
provision,
may
be
repealed,
has
never
prevented
this
court
from
determining
the
question
of
whether
so
long
as
it
exists,
it
is
constitutional
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
section
26
certainly
exists,
it
has
been
and
it
was
invoked
in
these
cases,
and
the
people
may
repeal
it.
they
may
amend
it,
but
as
long
as
it
is
there
on
the
statute
books
or
in
the
constitution
of
california,
the
question
of
whether
it
so
involves
the
state
in
private
racial
discrimination
as
to
make
the
fourteenth
amendment
applicable,
must
be
met.
now,
that
question
--
that
question
of
whether
it
involves
the
state
in
private
racial
discrimination
is
not
avoided.
it
is
not
avoided
by
saying
that
all
section
26
does
is
to
repeal
the
rumford
and
unruh
act,
sort
of
repeal
whatever
legislation
prohibitory
of
racial
discrimination
in
housing
may
have
existed
in
california
at
the
time
that
section
26
was
adopted.
it
does
not
avoid
the
constitution.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
your
honor.
that's
true.
the
significance
of
unruh
and
rumford
is
that
it
is
part
of
the
circumstances
leading
to
the
adoption
of
section
26
which
stamped
upon
it
the
indelible
and
inescapable
purpose
of
authorizing
racial
discrimination
in
housing
legislation
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
would
apply
in
part
although
i
regret
to
say
that
i
was
unable
to
convince
the
state
court
that
it
should
apply
just
to
prove
to
the
contrary,
notwithstanding.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i'll
elaborate
on
that
question.
i
am
prepared
--
the
argument,
in
fact
i'd
do
one
on
the
strength
of
an
--
of
the
analogy
to
this
court's
decision
in
evans
against
newton,
on
the
strength
of
the
analogy
to
this
court's
approval
of
the
decisions
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
south
carolina
white
primary
cases.
i
am
prepared
to
argue
that
purposeful
repeal
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
private
persons
to
do
that
which
the
state
cannot
do,
is
itself
a
denial
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
make
that
argument
in
the
state
court
in
the
briefs
and
orally.
and
the
only
response
i
got
to
that
argument
was
a
statement
from
the
bench
by
mr.
justice
peters,
i
do
not
agree
mr.
selvin.
the
court
below
did
not
go
on
that
ground.
we
have
argued
that
ground
here.
and
if
i
may,
without
elaborating
on
that
at
this
point,
before
i
conclude
i
may
take
that
up
again
and
show
what
the
analogy
to
evans,
to
terry
and
of
the
other
cases
that
i
have
mentioned
if
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i'm
compelled
to
say
for
variety
of
experience,
it
is
very
much
wider,
your
honor.
the
fact
is,
on
the
strength
of
a
simple
repealer
without
any
history,
without
any
context
of
--
of
purpose
and
intention
it's
practically,
and
perhaps,
should
be
impossible.
but
when
--
when
you
can
show
behind
that
repeal,
the
purpose,
the
purpose
to
avoid
or
evade
constitutional
restrictions
upon
the
state,
by
standing
by
while
private
persons
assume
some
activity
that
is
denied
to
the
state
and
clearing
the
way
for
those
persons
to
assume
and
carry
on
that
activity,
you
have
a
situation
that
this
very
much
--
that
is
very
much
like
south
carolina's
repeal
of
their
primary
laws,
in
order
to
permit
a
private
organization,
the
south
carolina
democratic
national
party
to
exclude
negroes
from
their
apartment.
or
very
much
--
or
very
much
like
the
action
of
the
--
of
the
so
--
of
the
jaybird
association
and
terry
which
was
a
private
organization
and
acted
--
and
acted
without
any
expressed
delegation
or
even
authorization
from
the
state.
purpose
in
repeal
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
think
we
do.
i
think
by
reference
to
the
valid
argument
there,
it's
there.
but
you
can
obtain
it
in
two
ways.
one
from
the
inherent
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
no.
it
didn't
--
didn't
go
on
the
--
it
didn't
go
on
the
base
--
it
didn't
on
the
basis
of
purposeful
repeal.
the
lower
court
--
the
state
court
did
not
base
its
invalidation
in
section
26
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
--
on
the
basis
of
purposeful
repeal,
but
the
purpose
--
the
purpose
has
been
expressed
by
the
official
voice
of
the
state
of
california.
this
being
an
initiative
measure,
the
state
of
--
the
law
of
california
requires
that
every
voter
be
given
a
so
called
valid
argument.
the
law
of
california
provides
for
the
selection
of
the
person
or
persons
who
will
write
that
argument.
the
state
of
california
prints
and
distributes
that
argument
to
every
voter,
and
in
the
argument
that
accompanied
section
26,
it
is
said
in
so
many
words,
that
adoption
of
this
measure
will
restore
the
right
you've
lost
under
rumford
to
refuse
to
sell
or
lease
residential
property
on
the
ground
of
race,
color,
national
origin,
or
religion.
it
is
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
no.
i
don't
--
we
don't
have
to
argue.
we
do
not
argue
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
compels
the
state
of
california
to
rest
--
to
pass
any
law.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but,
oh,
they've
done
more
than
that.
they've
expressed
more
than
the
desire.
they
have
adopted
an
official
policy
of
making
racial
discrimination
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
what
it
has
done.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
but
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
what
the
state
of
california
has
done
through
the
vote
of
its
people
is
to
make
a
freedom
of
racial
discrimination
in
housing
a
constitutional
right.
i
state
constitutional
right,
because
it
provides
that
the
state
shall
not
impair
abridge
or
limit
the
right
of
an
owner
of
residential
property
to
sell
or
refuse
to
sell,
lease
or
refuse
to
lease
as
he
in
his
absolute
discretion
determines.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
operate
directly
to
prohibit
private
conduct,
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
operate
to
prohibit
the
state,
from
involving
itself
in
discriminatory
private
conduct.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
the
state
has
said
more
than
that.
it
has
said,
not
that
we
will
simply
stand
on
the
sidelines
and
do
nothing.
it
has
said,
that
the
property
owner's
right
to
discriminate
on
the
ground
of
race
and
color
is
now
an
absolute
constitutional
right
about
which
the
state
can
or
will
do
nothing.
by
that
--
in
that
way,
it
has
authorized
--
it
has
authorized
the
discrimination
and
has
encouraged
them.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
has
not
said
that,
your
honor.
it
has
gone
--
it
has
gone
substantially
farther
by
saying
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
say
that
i
have
a
right
to
discriminate
on
racial
ground.
but
section
26
does
say
that
as
a
matter
of
california
constitutional
right,
i
have
that
--
i
have
that
right
and
it's
an
inviolable
right.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
is
that
no
state,
no
state
may
discriminate.
and
we
do
not
say,
we
do
not
say
and
this
--
and
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
by
its
own
force,
prohibits
private
racial
discrimination.
what
we
do
say
and
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
was
that
if
the
state
involves
itself
in
private
racial
discrimination,
it
is
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
our
position
here
is
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no.
if
it
refrains,
but
if
it
--
if
it
actually
involves
itself
in
it,
by
some
official
expression
of
the
state's
policy
or
what
you
call
it
that
on
section
26
is
that
if
it
involves
the
state
in
private
racial
discrimination,
why
then,
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies.
not
by
its
own
course
against
the
private
conduct,
but
against
the
vehicle
of
the
state's
involvement.
and
the
vehicle
of
the
state's
involvement
is
section
26.
now,
how
does
section
26
involve
the
state?
in
the
first
place,
it
makes
a
constitutional
right
out
of
racial
discrimination.
in
other
words,
it
has
authorized
it.
now,
to
authorize
is
not
necessarily
the
course
of
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
in
the
one
case,
by
authorizing,
you
have
given
the
stance
of
approval,
you
have
put
behind
the
practice,
the
power
and
the
prestige
of
the
state,
and
as
section
26
does,
you
have
immunized
those
who
indulge
in
the
practice
from
any
state
sanction
against
it.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
i
said
more
than
that.
the
state
won't
do
anything.
they
can't
do
anything,
whether
to
prosecute,
whether
to
pass
civil
legislation,
provide
civil
remedies,
provide
a
mediation
system,
which
is
what
the
rumford
act
does,
among
other
thing,
and
all
of
that.
now,
i
--
i
regret
that
i
--
i
can't
make
clearer
the
distinction
that
i
see
between
invoking
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
its
own
forces
of
prohibition
of
private
conduct,
which
i
think
everybody
--
not
everybody,
but
most
people
agree.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
and
refusing
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
prevent
state
action
of
some
sort
that
involves
itself
in
the
private
conduct.
the
one
case,
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
something
it
wasn't
intended
to,
private
action.
and
the
other,
it
applies
to
exactly
what
it
was
intended
to
apply
to,
the
action
or
conduct
of
the
state.
now,
if
the
state
authorizes,
if
the
state
encourages,
if
the
state
withdraws,
and
withholds
all
remedies
for
any
injury
caused
by
racial
discrimination,
it
has,
i
think,
certainly
has
involved
itself
in
the
racial
discrimination
that
takes
place.
it's
authorized
as
in
--
well,
it
was
in
mccabe.
all
that
was
done
in
mccabe
was
railroads
were
authorized
to
deprive
the
dining
and
sleeping
cars
for
white
persons
only.
they
weren't
compelled
to
do
it,
they
weren't
compelled
to
discriminate,
but
this
court
said
that
if
the
--
if
the
railroad
went
ahead
and
did
that,
it
would
--
it
would
be
unconstitutional
discrimination.
(inaudible)
the
radio
programs
on
the
street
cars
are
the
crams
here
in
washington.
state
didn't
compel
or
coerce
that
--
those
programs
being
broadcast.
all
that
the
state
did
or
the
government,
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
situation,
the
district
situation,
was
that
the
public
utilities
commission
--
the
public
utilities
commission,
refuse
to
prohibit
the
practice
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
--
no
damage
to
the
public
interest
to
convey
public
interest.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
think
the
majority
opinion
was
heavily
--
the
opinion
that
--
i
don't
know
whether
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
same
opinion,
but
i
think
that
was
neither
dissent
nor
concurrence.
that
was
an
abstention,
was
it
not,
your
honor?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that's
in
section
26.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
clause
of
section
26?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
court
could
not
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
not
their
rights
(inaudible)
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
you
see,
it
does
more
than
affect
the
jurisdiction.
it
plays
down
the
substantive
principle
--
the
substantive
principle,
but
racial
discrimination
it's
a
right
about
which
the
state
could
do
nothing.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
we
have
--
we
have
argued
although
the
state
court
did
not
--
did
not
--
to
place
his
position
upon
this
ground,
we
have
argued
that
one
of
the
abridging
aspects
in
section
26,
is
that
it
destroys
the
right
of
petition
to
the
state
court
to
recognize
or
create
a
common-law
action
for
racial
discrimination,
as
the
california
courts
did
in
the
case
of
racial
discrimination
of
the
labor
union,
but
the
--
the
question
of
whether
--
had
there
been
no
section
26,
had
there
been
no
rumford
or
unruh
act,
the
question
whether
we
would
have
a
situation
any
different
from
the
one
that
is
now
created
by
section
26,
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
that,
that
section
26
does
nothing
more,
but
create
a
reversion
in
time
back
to
the
situation
before
unruh
and
rumford.
the
question
there
obviously,
ties
right
in
to
mr.
pruitt's
invocation
of
the
transcendental
issue
of
a
form
of
our
government
because
it
brings
us
right
up,
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
it
brings
us
right
up
to
the
question
of,
what
is
--
what
is
the
substantial
content
of
the
doctrine
of
state
action?
now,
it
isn't
merely
a
literal
adherence
to
the
words
no
state
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
why
do
we
have
the
requirement
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
have
a
direct
prohibitory
force
against
private
conduct,
but
only
against
the
conduct
or
the
action
of
the
state?
it
is
--
if
i
read
my
history,
if
i
read
these
first
civil
rights
cases
correctly,
it
is
because
of
the
adherence
to
the
proposition
of
the
kind
of
federalism
upon
which
this
country
was
founded,
requires
that
matters
of
local
providence
should
stay
local
unless
the
state
in
--
acts
in
such
a
way,
a
respect
of
them
is
to
violate
the
federal
constitution.
now,
what
is
the
meaning
of
that?
it
was
referenced
to
racial
discrimination.
before
rumford
and
unruh,
or
that
legislation,
it
was,
i
suppose,
true
to
say,
legalistically
true,
that
was
one
free
to
refuse
to
sell
or
rent
on
racial
grounds.
that
was
true
only,
however,
because
of
state
in
action.
the
state
of
california
had
never
got
around
facing
up
to
the
problem.
i'd
never
got
around
doing
anything.
it
had
drifted.
it
had
drifted
into
the
policy
of
permitting
racial
discrimination,
not
permitting,
but
that,
at
least,
tolerating.
now,
if
we
let
inaction,
if
we
let
inaction
be
the
approval
of
state
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
we
have
centralized
practically
all
regulatory
control
here
in
washington
because
the
great
bulk
of
man's
activity,
the
great
bulk
of
man's
activity
are
carried
on
lawfully
only
because
the
state
has
never
gotten
around
to
prohibiting
them
more
regularly.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
--
the
two
effects
of
the
sections
supposed,
but
of
course,
section
26
is
not
limited
barely
to
a
declaration
of
hereafter.
any
california
legislation
dealing
with
racial
discrimination
must
be
adopted
by
the
vote
of
the
people.
it
goes
beyond
that.
in
goes
beyond
that
because
a
necessary
operation's
in
effect
until
such
times
the
people
act
in
the
future
it
has
made
racial
--
freedom
of
racial
discrimination,
i
should
take
a
constitutional
right.
it
is
whatever
the
constitution
--
made
it
inviolable,
and
as
matter
of
fact
though,
while
--
while
it
can
--
it
can
have
a
much
broader
operation
under
this,
had
the
least
cases,
it
was
what
precipitated
the
question
in
these
cases
because
in
--
until
section
26
was
adopted,
the
california
courts
had
no
reason
to
dismiss
the
cases
or
to
have
to
argue
with
anything,
but
hear
them
on
the
merits
and
decide
what
relief,
if
any,
the
plaintiffs
had
--
were
entitled
to.
but
as
soon
as
section
26
came
on,
the
effect
of
section
26
was
to
remove
those
cases
from
the
power
of
the
court
to
deal
with
in
any
effective
way.
and
for
that
reason
the
trial
court
in
reitman
dismissed
or
under
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
the
underground
situation
is
slightly
different.
well,
now
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
didn't
hear
you,
your
honor?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
they
didn't
remove
the
jurisdiction,
they
removed
the
power
that
was
the
--
that
was
a
loose
use
of
language
and
i
thought,
what
it
did
was
disenable
the
court
from
rendering
any
relief
that
would
in
any
way
abridge,
limit
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
certainly
not.
that
--
that's
why
we're
here.
and
i
mean,
that's
why
we're
as
respondents
rather
than
petitioners,
but
the
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
that's
true,
but
this
amendment
purports
--
this
amendment
purports
to
deprive
the
court,
the
state
courts
of
any
power
to
limit
or
abridge
or
impair
the
right
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
out
of
state
power.
that's
right,
out
of
state
power.
but
the
only
way
the
court
can
be
reinstated
with
power,
through
the
operation
of
the
federal
constitution,
is
for
some
court
having
jurisdiction
to
say
that
the
attempt
of
the
--
an
abridgement
under
section
26
cannot
--
cannot
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
abridgement
of
the
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yeah,
well,
the
--
of
the
power
--
or
the
abridgement
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
render
such
relief
as
is
required
by
the
law
of
the
land,
which
may
be
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
something
else.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
law
of
the
federal
government
--
the
law
of
the
federal
government.
but
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
--
i
could
summarize
it
but
then
i
will
elaborate
on
it,
but
i
can
summarize
it
one
summarize
it
in
one
sentence
because
it
involves
the
state
in
the
racial,
in
the
private
racial
discrimination.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
has
--
it
has
told
the
people
that
they
are
free
to
discriminate,
insofar
as
any
law
of
the
state
is
concerned.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
not
just
told
--
told
the
individual.
it
has
told
the
whole
state
so
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
--
just
as
--
just
as
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
--
well,
it
has
told
--
it
has
said
so,
exactly
as
how
was
--
how
was
the
state
of
louisiana
involved
--
involved
in
private
discrimination
when
it
required
the
race
of
the
candidate
to
be
put
on
the
ballots?
this
court
said,
that
having
regard
to
known
private
attitudes
and
pressures
upon
negroes,
the
mere
statement
of
race
on
the
ballot
was
an
encouragement,
an
invitation
to
racial
discrimination,
although
certainly,
the
state
didn't
coerce
it
or
command
in
that
case.
now,
what
has
california
done
here?
it
has
said
to
these
people,
you
are
authorized.
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
discriminate
on
racial
grounds.
if
you
do,
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned,
if
you
do,
nothing
will
happen
to
you,
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned.
is
not
that
as
what
you
mean,
encouragement
as
the
simple
statement,
negro,
opposite
the
name
on
a
--
on
a
ballot
and
the
state
cannot
encourage,
the
state
cannot
encourage
racial
discrimination.
it
may
be,
it
maybe
as
mr.
pruitt
has
argued
in
the
brief,
as
i
don't
--
i
don't
concede
entirely.
it
may
be
that
the
state
can
remain
inert
in
the
face
of
racial
discrimination
or
indifferent
to
it,
but
if
it
acts,
if
it
acts
in
the
field
of
racial
discrimination,
i
submit
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
law
requires
that
it
can
act
in
only
one
way,
and
that
is
against
it.
now,
the
state
of
california
has
acted.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
guess
that
leaves
the
power
also.
it's
not
inert
of
police
powers.
and
by
withdrawing,
by
advocating
his
responsibility
of
at
least
supplying
some
protection,
the
state
cannot
refuse
to
protect
the
federal
right
and
yet
it
purports
to
do
so.
in
mulkey
--
in
mulkey,
the
state
court
dismissed
the
complaint
because
section
26,
because
of
the
operation
of
section
26,
now
that
was
a
trial
court.
the
state's
--
the
state
supreme
court
rescued
the
situation
on
the
ground
that
i
think
you
are
--
you
have
in
mind
here,
you
are
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
constitution
prevented
--
prevented
any
such
abdication
or
abnegation
of
responsibility
and
what?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
sure,
that's
settled.
it
settled
it.
but
the
federal
constitution
has
to
apply
the
state
action.
and
now,
what
i
am
trying
to
isolate
at
the
moment
is
what
it
is
that
california
has
done
that
offends
the
federal
constitution.
and
what
it
has
done,
is
so
far
as
it
was
within
its
power
to
do
so,
it
has
told
its
people
that
they
are
free
to
discriminate.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
in
fact
this
is
what
the
state
has
done?
then
has
it
not
in
effect
--
in
substantial
effect
encouraged
those
who
want
and
are
willing
to
discriminate?
and
isn't
that
encouragement
just
as
much
on
constitutional
state
action
as
on
a
higher
plane,
coercion
would
be?
that
--
that
is
our
point
and
that's
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
insofar
as
it
as
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
do
so,
of
course,
the
state
can't
repeal
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
incidentally,
not
all
18
million
people
of
california
can
repeal
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
as
i
think
this
court
told
colorado
in
lucas.
but
--
so
that
the
fact
that
the
people
adopted
this
amendment
is
beside,
but
the
state,
insofar
as
it
is
possible
for
it
to
do
so,
has
assured
its
citizens
that
nothing
is
going
to
happen
to
them
on
account
of
racial
discrimination.
isn't
it
assumed
that
all
it
is.
assume
that
all
of
section
26
is,
it's
a
more
or
less
academic
preachment
to
its
people.
is
it
any
the
less
of
an
encouragement
in
that
regard,
than
the
statements
issued
by
the
mayor
and
chief
of
police
in
lombard?
they
weren't
coercive,
they
weren't
binding
on
the
people,
but
they
published
statements
saying,
"don't
protest."
and
that
--
and
it
was
that
part,
that
activity
on
the
part
of
two
city
officials
that
this
court
--
that
this
court
held
to
be
the
involvement
of
the
state
in
the
private
racial
discrimination
that
was
going
on
in
that
case.
now,
here's
a
statement
published
in
a
newspaper
in
lombard.
here
is
a
provision
of
the
said
constitution
of
california
found
on
the
same
article
as
it
guarantees
a
free
speech
religion
of
the
press.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
some
kind
of
an
encouragement?
and
if
it's
an
encouragement,
it
must
be
an
involvement
within
the
meaning
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
believe.
now,
when
you
have
authorization
by
making
it
a
constitutional
right,
when
you
have
encouragement,
when
you
have
the
withdrawal
of
the
state
from
the
field
and
the
abdication
of
whatever
responsibility
it
may
have
for
providing
its
citizens
with
remedies
for
injuries,
you
have,
i
submit,
a
fairly
strong
case
of
involvement.
now,
there
are
--
what
i
have
said,
insofar
as
it
applies
at
all,
is
equally
--
is
applicable
to
the
two
cases
that
are
here
under
the
one
written.
i'm
not
going
to
say
anything
about
the
shelley
doctrine.
when
mr.
wirin's
turn
comes,
i
think,
he
will
take
care
of
that.
i'm
going
to
say
very
little
about
separability,
because
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
solicitor
general
may
touch
on
that
subject.
separability
or
severability,
of
course,
is
a
state
question,
but
i
would
like
to
just
devote,
to
explain
what
it
was
that
the
court
below
held
in
respect
to
severability.
section
26
contains
not
a
single
word
of
repeal.
it
doesn't
say
the
rumford
act
is
repealed,
the
unruh
act
is
repealed
or
anything
else
is
repealed.
it
lays
down
a
general
proposition
that
the
right
--
the
right
to
refuse
to
sell,
shall
not
be
limited,
abridged,
or
impaired
by
any
of
--
by
the
state
or
any
of
its
agencies.
the
reason
rumford
and
unruh
are
deemed
to
be
repealed
by
that,
is
because
they
are
inconsistent
with
that
substantive
proposition
of
law
enacted
by
section
26.
now,
it
is
that
substantive
proposition
that
involves
the
state
by
our
submission,
that
involves
the
state
in
the
private
conduct,
and
therefore,
it
is
that
substantive
proposition
of
law
that
raises
the
constitutional
questions
that
are
being
argued
here.
unless
--
unless
that
substantive
provision
is
itself
valid,
there
can
be
no
repeal
because
repeal
is
a
function
of
the
--
is
a
function
of
the
substantive
provision.
what
the
california
court
held
was,
and
this
is
california
law,
and
it
may
be
good
law
or
bad
law,
but
it's
california
law
and
for
this
purpose,
it's
conclusive,
because
severability
is
a
state
question.
what
the
california
court
held
and
all
that
it
held,
this
discussion
will
be
found
on
pages
29,
30,
and
31
of
the
record
in
this
case.
then
they
did
not
go
in
the
law
or
in
the
convolutions
to
which
mr.
pruitt
referred,
at
least,
not
as
i
read
the
opinion.
what
it
did
hold
was
simply
this,
that
we
can't
rewrite
the
statute.
if
we
can
excise
the
part
that
renders
the
statute
unconstitutional,
and
what
is
left
is
constitutional,
we
will
give
force
to
what
is
left.
but
here,
here
is
the
thing
that's
unconstitutional.
the
part
of
the
statute
that's
unconstitutional
is
this
one
sentence
that
establishes
the
substantive
proposition
of
law.
excise
that
from
the
statute
and
there's
nothing
left
to
effect
that
it'd
repeal.
that
was
the
california
court's
decision
on
severability
and
as
--
in
complete
accord
with
the
california
decision,
and
it
is
entirely
a
matter
for
the
state
court.
now,
i
have
i
think
a
moment
or
two
before
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
invoke
every
ground
that
is
properly
in
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
some
of
the
grounds
that
the
--
some
of
them
--
at
least
one
of
them
is
a
ground
that
the
california
court
expressly
disagreed
within
in
its
opinion.
that's
the
question
of
a
--
that's
a
question
of
an
affirmative
duty
to
protect.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
one
of
them
is
a
ground
with
which
they
disagreed
by
ignoring
it.
that
is
what
i
call
purposeful
repeal.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
purposeful
repeal?
well,
it
involves
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
true.
but
when
i
say
that
i've
local
grounds,
your
honor,
i
am
simply
plagiarizing
a
comment
made
by
a
district
judge
in
a
record
with
which
i
once
had
the
deal.
what
he's
saying
in
objection,
he
invoked
all
ground,
so
i
do
the
same
thing
here,
your
honor,
and
i
think
with
precedent.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
--
i'm
hopeful.
i
hope
that
your
honor's
analysis
of
the
opinion
is
correct.
it
is
not
expressed
in
the
opinion.
it
is
not
expressed
in
the
(inaudible)
opinion
but
one
in
mulkey.
my
only
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
the
hill
case,
so
the
absent
--
absent
any
legislation
on
the
subject,
there
was
--
there
was
no
common-law
action.
there
was
no
action
in
california
for
a
relief
on
account
of
the
racial
discrimination.
and
hill
didn't
bring
himself
within
the
particular
statute
there
because
he
had
--
he
didn't
have
--
he
didn't
have
the
records
of
type
--
the
records
of
type
of
dwelling
that
was
involved
in
the
statute
--
and
the
legislation
that
applied
in
california.
and
the
argument
that
california
was
obligated
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
providing
with
protection
against
this
--
against
private
racial
--
disqualification
is
expressly
rejected
in
--
in
the
amending,
the
modified
hill
opinion,
the
modification
of
the
hill
opinion.
i
don't
say
to
question
about
--
that
california,
at
least,
with
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
that
there
was
no
obligation
in
the
court
of
california
to
provide
--
provide
a
remedy
for
private
racial
discrimination.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
and
i
then
take
that.
i
take
that
as
a
rejection
of
our
argument
because
it
had
been
argued
at
length
in
the
briefs
and
at
length
in
the
--
in
the
oral
argument.
on
purposeful
repeal,
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
a
rejection
is
they're
silent
on
that
subject,
plus
the
comment
of
mr.
justice
peters'
from
the
bench
to
which
i
refer.
but
the
grounds
in
here,
in
the
record
here,
and
if
they
are
good
grounds,
this
court
is
not
confined
to
the
grounds
used
by
the
lower
court,
although
i
agree
with,
i
think,
the
implication
of
mr.
justice
white's
comment
that
perhaps
on
the
question
of
purposeful
repeal,
the
california
court's
silence
ought
to
be
given
some
significance
in
view
of
their,
presumably,
greater
knowledge
of
local
conditions
of
circumstances,
particularly
the
circumstances
that
produced
section
26.
although,
those
circumstances
were
pretty
thoroughly
presented
to
the
court
by
a
way
of
--
by
way
of
a
request
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh
no
--
no,
i
--
i
don't
want
ever
to
give
that
up,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
clearest
amongst
direct
evidence
of
the
purpose
of
section
26
and
the
reason
that
i
think
it
is
so
significant
because
as
i
said,
that
seems
it's
quite
a
long
time.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i'm
sure
that
the
court
--
i'm
sure
that
the
court
--
i'll
be
candid.
i'm
sure
that
the
court
would
avail
this
--
would
have
availed
itself
of
every
tenable
ground
that
it
thought
would
support
as
a
result
and
it
didn't
put
its
decision
on
that
ground.
i
must
confess
that
that
makes
me
think
nonetheless
of
the
argument
that
we
made,
but
that
is
the
fact.
they
didn't
adopt
the
argument.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
will,
i
think,
perhaps,
conduce
to
appropriate
analysis
of
the
issue
in
this
case,
if
we
stop
for
a
moment
to
see
just
what
it
is
that
section
26
does,
what
it
was
intended
to
do,
and
how
it
operates
to
accomplish
that
intention.
section
26,
is
not,
a
mere
declaration
of
policy
to
the
effect
that
owners
of
residential
property
may
deal
with
those
with
whom
they
please.
it
is
a
prohibition
upon
a
withdrawal
of
powers
of
state
government
to
deal
with
racial
discrimination
in
the
sale,
rental,
and
leasing
of
residential
property.
it
says
in
so
many
words,
that
neither
the
state
nor
any
its
agencies,
and
that
of
course
includes
the
legislature,
it
includes
the
courts,
it
includes
the
executive
branch,
but
not
the
people.
that
it
includes
the
people
acting
as
a
legislature,
but
not
as
a
constitutional
convention.
they
could
repeal
--
they
could
repeal
their
own
amendment
to
the
constitution
as
they
could
add
one.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
is.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
that
is
what
makes
section
26
the
clearest
example
of
state
action,
the
fact
that
it
is
legislation-adopted
by
use
of
the
apparatus
of
--
of
california
state
government.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
paralyzes
all
the
branches
of
but
except
the
people
acting
through
the
initiative
or
perhaps,
well,
through
the
initiative,
because
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
a
referendum
if
the
legislature
is
paralyzed.
it
does
not
paralyze
--
it
does
not
stop
that.
but
let
me
--
let
me
say
this
on
the
side
for
that.
the
possibility
that
some
statute
or
some
state
constitutional
provision,
may
be
repealed,
has
never
prevented
this
court
from
determining
the
question
of
whether
so
long
as
it
exists,
it
is
constitutional
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
section
26
certainly
exists,
it
has
been
and
it
was
invoked
in
these
cases,
and
the
people
may
repeal
it.
they
may
amend
it,
but
as
long
as
it
is
there
on
the
statute
books
or
in
the
constitution
of
california,
the
question
of
whether
it
so
involves
the
state
in
private
racial
discrimination
as
to
make
the
fourteenth
amendment
applicable,
must
be
met.
now,
that
question
--
that
question
of
whether
it
involves
the
state
in
private
racial
discrimination
is
not
avoided.
it
is
not
avoided
by
saying
that
all
section
26
does
is
to
repeal
the
rumford
and
unruh
act,
sort
of
repeal
whatever
legislation
prohibitory
of
racial
discrimination
in
housing
may
have
existed
in
california
at
the
time
that
section
26
was
adopted.
it
does
not
avoid
the
constitution.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
your
honor.
that's
true.
the
significance
of
unruh
and
rumford
is
that
it
is
part
of
the
circumstances
leading
to
the
adoption
of
section
26
which
stamped
upon
it
the
indelible
and
inescapable
purpose
of
authorizing
racial
discrimination
in
housing
legislation
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
would
apply
in
part
although
i
regret
to
say
that
i
was
unable
to
convince
the
state
court
that
it
should
apply
just
to
prove
to
the
contrary,
notwithstanding.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i'll
elaborate
on
that
question.
i
am
prepared
--
the
argument,
in
fact
i'd
do
one
on
the
strength
of
an
--
of
the
analogy
to
this
court's
decision
in
evans
against
newton,
on
the
strength
of
the
analogy
to
this
court's
approval
of
the
decisions
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
south
carolina
white
primary
cases.
i
am
prepared
to
argue
that
purposeful
repeal
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
private
persons
to
do
that
which
the
state
cannot
do,
is
itself
a
denial
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
make
that
argument
in
the
state
court
in
the
briefs
and
orally.
and
the
only
response
i
got
to
that
argument
was
a
statement
from
the
bench
by
mr.
justice
peters,
i
do
not
agree
mr.
selvin.
the
court
below
did
not
go
on
that
ground.
we
have
argued
that
ground
here.
and
if
i
may,
without
elaborating
on
that
at
this
point,
before
i
conclude
i
may
take
that
up
again
and
show
what
the
analogy
to
evans,
to
terry
and
of
the
other
cases
that
i
have
mentioned
if
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i'm
compelled
to
say
for
variety
of
experience,
it
is
very
much
wider,
your
honor.
the
fact
is,
on
the
strength
of
a
simple
repealer
without
any
history,
without
any
context
of
--
of
purpose
and
intention
it's
practically,
and
perhaps,
should
be
impossible.
but
when
--
when
you
can
show
behind
that
repeal,
the
purpose,
the
purpose
to
avoid
or
evade
constitutional
restrictions
upon
the
state,
by
standing
by
while
private
persons
assume
some
activity
that
is
denied
to
the
state
and
clearing
the
way
for
those
persons
to
assume
and
carry
on
that
activity,
you
have
a
situation
that
this
very
much
--
that
is
very
much
like
south
carolina's
repeal
of
their
primary
laws,
in
order
to
permit
a
private
organization,
the
south
carolina
democratic
national
party
to
exclude
negroes
from
their
apartment.
or
very
much
--
or
very
much
like
the
action
of
the
--
of
the
so
--
of
the
jaybird
association
and
terry
which
was
a
private
organization
and
acted
--
and
acted
without
any
expressed
delegation
or
even
authorization
from
the
state.
purpose
in
repeal
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
think
we
do.
i
think
by
reference
to
the
valid
argument
there,
it's
there.
but
you
can
obtain
it
in
two
ways.
one
from
the
inherent
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
no.
it
didn't
--
didn't
go
on
the
--
it
didn't
go
on
the
base
--
it
didn't
on
the
basis
of
purposeful
repeal.
the
lower
court
--
the
state
court
did
not
base
its
invalidation
in
section
26
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
--
on
the
basis
of
purposeful
repeal,
but
the
purpose
--
the
purpose
has
been
expressed
by
the
official
voice
of
the
state
of
california.
this
being
an
initiative
measure,
the
state
of
--
the
law
of
california
requires
that
every
voter
be
given
a
so
called
valid
argument.
the
law
of
california
provides
for
the
selection
of
the
person
or
persons
who
will
write
that
argument.
the
state
of
california
prints
and
distributes
that
argument
to
every
voter,
and
in
the
argument
that
accompanied
section
26,
it
is
said
in
so
many
words,
that
adoption
of
this
measure
will
restore
the
right
you've
lost
under
rumford
to
refuse
to
sell
or
lease
residential
property
on
the
ground
of
race,
color,
national
origin,
or
religion.
it
is
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
no.
i
don't
--
we
don't
have
to
argue.
we
do
not
argue
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
compels
the
state
of
california
to
rest
--
to
pass
any
law.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but,
oh,
they've
done
more
than
that.
they've
expressed
more
than
the
desire.
they
have
adopted
an
official
policy
of
making
racial
discrimination
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
what
it
has
done.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
but
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
what
the
state
of
california
has
done
through
the
vote
of
its
people
is
to
make
a
freedom
of
racial
discrimination
in
housing
a
constitutional
right.
i
state
constitutional
right,
because
it
provides
that
the
state
shall
not
impair
abridge
or
limit
the
right
of
an
owner
of
residential
property
to
sell
or
refuse
to
sell,
lease
or
refuse
to
lease
as
he
in
his
absolute
discretion
determines.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
operate
directly
to
prohibit
private
conduct,
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
operate
to
prohibit
the
state,
from
involving
itself
in
discriminatory
private
conduct.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
the
state
has
said
more
than
that.
it
has
said,
not
that
we
will
simply
stand
on
the
sidelines
and
do
nothing.
it
has
said,
that
the
property
owner's
right
to
discriminate
on
the
ground
of
race
and
color
is
now
an
absolute
constitutional
right
about
which
the
state
can
or
will
do
nothing.
by
that
--
in
that
way,
it
has
authorized
--
it
has
authorized
the
discrimination
and
has
encouraged
them.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
has
not
said
that,
your
honor.
it
has
gone
--
it
has
gone
substantially
farther
by
saying
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
say
that
i
have
a
right
to
discriminate
on
racial
ground.
but
section
26
does
say
that
as
a
matter
of
california
constitutional
right,
i
have
that
--
i
have
that
right
and
it's
an
inviolable
right.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
is
that
no
state,
no
state
may
discriminate.
and
we
do
not
say,
we
do
not
say
and
this
--
and
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
by
its
own
force,
prohibits
private
racial
discrimination.
what
we
do
say
and
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
was
that
if
the
state
involves
itself
in
private
racial
discrimination,
it
is
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
our
position
here
is
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no.
if
it
refrains,
but
if
it
--
if
it
actually
involves
itself
in
it,
by
some
official
expression
of
the
state's
policy
or
what
you
call
it
that
on
section
26
is
that
if
it
involves
the
state
in
private
racial
discrimination,
why
then,
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies.
not
by
its
own
course
against
the
private
conduct,
but
against
the
vehicle
of
the
state's
involvement.
and
the
vehicle
of
the
state's
involvement
is
section
26.
now,
how
does
section
26
involve
the
state?
in
the
first
place,
it
makes
a
constitutional
right
out
of
racial
discrimination.
in
other
words,
it
has
authorized
it.
now,
to
authorize
is
not
necessarily
the
course
of
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
in
the
one
case,
by
authorizing,
you
have
given
the
stance
of
approval,
you
have
put
behind
the
practice,
the
power
and
the
prestige
of
the
state,
and
as
section
26
does,
you
have
immunized
those
who
indulge
in
the
practice
from
any
state
sanction
against
it.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
i
said
more
than
that.
the
state
won't
do
anything.
they
can't
do
anything,
whether
to
prosecute,
whether
to
pass
civil
legislation,
provide
civil
remedies,
provide
a
mediation
system,
which
is
what
the
rumford
act
does,
among
other
thing,
and
all
of
that.
now,
i
--
i
regret
that
i
--
i
can't
make
clearer
the
distinction
that
i
see
between
invoking
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
its
own
forces
of
prohibition
of
private
conduct,
which
i
think
everybody
--
not
everybody,
but
most
people
agree.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
and
refusing
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
prevent
state
action
of
some
sort
that
involves
itself
in
the
private
conduct.
the
one
case,
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
something
it
wasn't
intended
to,
private
action.
and
the
other,
it
applies
to
exactly
what
it
was
intended
to
apply
to,
the
action
or
conduct
of
the
state.
now,
if
the
state
authorizes,
if
the
state
encourages,
if
the
state
withdraws,
and
withholds
all
remedies
for
any
injury
caused
by
racial
discrimination,
it
has,
i
think,
certainly
has
involved
itself
in
the
racial
discrimination
that
takes
place.
it's
authorized
as
in
--
well,
it
was
in
mccabe.
all
that
was
done
in
mccabe
was
railroads
were
authorized
to
deprive
the
dining
and
sleeping
cars
for
white
persons
only.
they
weren't
compelled
to
do
it,
they
weren't
compelled
to
discriminate,
but
this
court
said
that
if
the
--
if
the
railroad
went
ahead
and
did
that,
it
would
--
it
would
be
unconstitutional
discrimination.
(inaudible)
the
radio
programs
on
the
street
cars
are
the
crams
here
in
washington.
state
didn't
compel
or
coerce
that
--
those
programs
being
broadcast.
all
that
the
state
did
or
the
government,
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
situation,
the
district
situation,
was
that
the
public
utilities
commission
--
the
public
utilities
commission,
refuse
to
prohibit
the
practice
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
--
no
damage
to
the
public
interest
to
convey
public
interest.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
think
the
majority
opinion
was
heavily
--
the
opinion
that
--
i
don't
know
whether
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
same
opinion,
but
i
think
that
was
neither
dissent
nor
concurrence.
that
was
an
abstention,
was
it
not,
your
honor?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that's
in
section
26.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
clause
of
section
26?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
court
could
not
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
not
their
rights
(inaudible)
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
you
see,
it
does
more
than
affect
the
jurisdiction.
it
plays
down
the
substantive
principle
--
the
substantive
principle,
but
racial
discrimination
it's
a
right
about
which
the
state
could
do
nothing.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
we
have
--
we
have
argued
although
the
state
court
did
not
--
did
not
--
to
place
his
position
upon
this
ground,
we
have
argued
that
one
of
the
abridging
aspects
in
section
26,
is
that
it
destroys
the
right
of
petition
to
the
state
court
to
recognize
or
create
a
common-law
action
for
racial
discrimination,
as
the
california
courts
did
in
the
case
of
racial
discrimination
of
the
labor
union,
but
the
--
the
question
of
whether
--
had
there
been
no
section
26,
had
there
been
no
rumford
or
unruh
act,
the
question
whether
we
would
have
a
situation
any
different
from
the
one
that
is
now
created
by
section
26,
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
that,
that
section
26
does
nothing
more,
but
create
a
reversion
in
time
back
to
the
situation
before
unruh
and
rumford.
the
question
there
obviously,
ties
right
in
to
mr.
pruitt's
invocation
of
the
transcendental
issue
of
a
form
of
our
government
because
it
brings
us
right
up,
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
it
brings
us
right
up
to
the
question
of,
what
is
--
what
is
the
substantial
content
of
the
doctrine
of
state
action?
now,
it
isn't
merely
a
literal
adherence
to
the
words
no
state
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
why
do
we
have
the
requirement
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
have
a
direct
prohibitory
force
against
private
conduct,
but
only
against
the
conduct
or
the
action
of
the
state?
it
is
--
if
i
read
my
history,
if
i
read
these
first
civil
rights
cases
correctly,
it
is
because
of
the
adherence
to
the
proposition
of
the
kind
of
federalism
upon
which
this
country
was
founded,
requires
that
matters
of
local
providence
should
stay
local
unless
the
state
in
--
acts
in
such
a
way,
a
respect
of
them
is
to
violate
the
federal
constitution.
now,
what
is
the
meaning
of
that?
it
was
referenced
to
racial
discrimination.
before
rumford
and
unruh,
or
that
legislation,
it
was,
i
suppose,
true
to
say,
legalistically
true,
that
was
one
free
to
refuse
to
sell
or
rent
on
racial
grounds.
that
was
true
only,
however,
because
of
state
in
action.
the
state
of
california
had
never
got
around
facing
up
to
the
problem.
i'd
never
got
around
doing
anything.
it
had
drifted.
it
had
drifted
into
the
policy
of
permitting
racial
discrimination,
not
permitting,
but
that,
at
least,
tolerating.
now,
if
we
let
inaction,
if
we
let
inaction
be
the
approval
of
state
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
we
have
centralized
practically
all
regulatory
control
here
in
washington
because
the
great
bulk
of
man's
activity,
the
great
bulk
of
man's
activity
are
carried
on
lawfully
only
because
the
state
has
never
gotten
around
to
prohibiting
them
more
regularly.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
--
the
two
effects
of
the
sections
supposed,
but
of
course,
section
26
is
not
limited
barely
to
a
declaration
of
hereafter.
any
california
legislation
dealing
with
racial
discrimination
must
be
adopted
by
the
vote
of
the
people.
it
goes
beyond
that.
in
goes
beyond
that
because
a
necessary
operation's
in
effect
until
such
times
the
people
act
in
the
future
it
has
made
racial
--
freedom
of
racial
discrimination,
i
should
take
a
constitutional
right.
it
is
whatever
the
constitution
--
made
it
inviolable,
and
as
matter
of
fact
though,
while
--
while
it
can
--
it
can
have
a
much
broader
operation
under
this,
had
the
least
cases,
it
was
what
precipitated
the
question
in
these
cases
because
in
--
until
section
26
was
adopted,
the
california
courts
had
no
reason
to
dismiss
the
cases
or
to
have
to
argue
with
anything,
but
hear
them
on
the
merits
and
decide
what
relief,
if
any,
the
plaintiffs
had
--
were
entitled
to.
but
as
soon
as
section
26
came
on,
the
effect
of
section
26
was
to
remove
those
cases
from
the
power
of
the
court
to
deal
with
in
any
effective
way.
and
for
that
reason
the
trial
court
in
reitman
dismissed
or
under
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
the
underground
situation
is
slightly
different.
well,
now
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
didn't
hear
you,
your
honor?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
they
didn't
remove
the
jurisdiction,
they
removed
the
power
that
was
the
--
that
was
a
loose
use
of
language
and
i
thought,
what
it
did
was
disenable
the
court
from
rendering
any
relief
that
would
in
any
way
abridge,
limit
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
certainly
not.
that
--
that's
why
we're
here.
and
i
mean,
that's
why
we're
as
respondents
rather
than
petitioners,
but
the
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
that's
true,
but
this
amendment
purports
--
this
amendment
purports
to
deprive
the
court,
the
state
courts
of
any
power
to
limit
or
abridge
or
impair
the
right
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
out
of
state
power.
that's
right,
out
of
state
power.
but
the
only
way
the
court
can
be
reinstated
with
power,
through
the
operation
of
the
federal
constitution,
is
for
some
court
having
jurisdiction
to
say
that
the
attempt
of
the
--
an
abridgement
under
section
26
cannot
--
cannot
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
abridgement
of
the
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yeah,
well,
the
--
of
the
power
--
or
the
abridgement
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
render
such
relief
as
is
required
by
the
law
of
the
land,
which
may
be
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
something
else.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
law
of
the
federal
government
--
the
law
of
the
federal
government.
but
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
--
i
could
summarize
it
but
then
i
will
elaborate
on
it,
but
i
can
summarize
it
one
summarize
it
in
one
sentence
because
it
involves
the
state
in
the
racial,
in
the
private
racial
discrimination.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
has
--
it
has
told
the
people
that
they
are
free
to
discriminate,
insofar
as
any
law
of
the
state
is
concerned.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
not
just
told
--
told
the
individual.
it
has
told
the
whole
state
so
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
--
just
as
--
just
as
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
--
well,
it
has
told
--
it
has
said
so,
exactly
as
how
was
--
how
was
the
state
of
louisiana
involved
--
involved
in
private
discrimination
when
it
required
the
race
of
the
candidate
to
be
put
on
the
ballots?
this
court
said,
that
having
regard
to
known
private
attitudes
and
pressures
upon
negroes,
the
mere
statement
of
race
on
the
ballot
was
an
encouragement,
an
invitation
to
racial
discrimination,
although
certainly,
the
state
didn't
coerce
it
or
command
in
that
case.
now,
what
has
california
done
here?
it
has
said
to
these
people,
you
are
authorized.
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
discriminate
on
racial
grounds.
if
you
do,
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned,
if
you
do,
nothing
will
happen
to
you,
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned.
is
not
that
as
what
you
mean,
encouragement
as
the
simple
statement,
negro,
opposite
the
name
on
a
--
on
a
ballot
and
the
state
cannot
encourage,
the
state
cannot
encourage
racial
discrimination.
it
may
be,
it
maybe
as
mr.
pruitt
has
argued
in
the
brief,
as
i
don't
--
i
don't
concede
entirely.
it
may
be
that
the
state
can
remain
inert
in
the
face
of
racial
discrimination
or
indifferent
to
it,
but
if
it
acts,
if
it
acts
in
the
field
of
racial
discrimination,
i
submit
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
law
requires
that
it
can
act
in
only
one
way,
and
that
is
against
it.
now,
the
state
of
california
has
acted.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
guess
that
leaves
the
power
also.
it's
not
inert
of
police
powers.
and
by
withdrawing,
by
advocating
his
responsibility
of
at
least
supplying
some
protection,
the
state
cannot
refuse
to
protect
the
federal
right
and
yet
it
purports
to
do
so.
in
mulkey
--
in
mulkey,
the
state
court
dismissed
the
complaint
because
section
26,
because
of
the
operation
of
section
26,
now
that
was
a
trial
court.
the
state's
--
the
state
supreme
court
rescued
the
situation
on
the
ground
that
i
think
you
are
--
you
have
in
mind
here,
you
are
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
constitution
prevented
--
prevented
any
such
abdication
or
abnegation
of
responsibility
and
what?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
sure,
that's
settled.
it
settled
it.
but
the
federal
constitution
has
to
apply
the
state
action.
and
now,
what
i
am
trying
to
isolate
at
the
moment
is
what
it
is
that
california
has
done
that
offends
the
federal
constitution.
and
what
it
has
done,
is
so
far
as
it
was
within
its
power
to
do
so,
it
has
told
its
people
that
they
are
free
to
discriminate.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
in
fact
this
is
what
the
state
has
done?
then
has
it
not
in
effect
--
in
substantial
effect
encouraged
those
who
want
and
are
willing
to
discriminate?
and
isn't
that
encouragement
just
as
much
on
constitutional
state
action
as
on
a
higher
plane,
coercion
would
be?
that
--
that
is
our
point
and
that's
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
insofar
as
it
as
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
do
so,
of
course,
the
state
can't
repeal
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
incidentally,
not
all
18
million
people
of
california
can
repeal
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
as
i
think
this
court
told
colorado
in
lucas.
but
--
so
that
the
fact
that
the
people
adopted
this
amendment
is
beside,
but
the
state,
insofar
as
it
is
possible
for
it
to
do
so,
has
assured
its
citizens
that
nothing
is
going
to
happen
to
them
on
account
of
racial
discrimination.
isn't
it
assumed
that
all
it
is.
assume
that
all
of
section
26
is,
it's
a
more
or
less
academic
preachment
to
its
people.
is
it
any
the
less
of
an
encouragement
in
that
regard,
than
the
statements
issued
by
the
mayor
and
chief
of
police
in
lombard?
they
weren't
coercive,
they
weren't
binding
on
the
people,
but
they
published
statements
saying,
"don't
protest."
and
that
--
and
it
was
that
part,
that
activity
on
the
part
of
two
city
officials
that
this
court
--
that
this
court
held
to
be
the
involvement
of
the
state
in
the
private
racial
discrimination
that
was
going
on
in
that
case.
now,
here's
a
statement
published
in
a
newspaper
in
lombard.
here
is
a
provision
of
the
said
constitution
of
california
found
on
the
same
article
as
it
guarantees
a
free
speech
religion
of
the
press.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
some
kind
of
an
encouragement?
and
if
it's
an
encouragement,
it
must
be
an
involvement
within
the
meaning
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
believe.
now,
when
you
have
authorization
by
making
it
a
constitutional
right,
when
you
have
encouragement,
when
you
have
the
withdrawal
of
the
state
from
the
field
and
the
abdication
of
whatever
responsibility
it
may
have
for
providing
its
citizens
with
remedies
for
injuries,
you
have,
i
submit,
a
fairly
strong
case
of
involvement.
now,
there
are
--
what
i
have
said,
insofar
as
it
applies
at
all,
is
equally
--
is
applicable
to
the
two
cases
that
are
here
under
the
one
written.
i'm
not
going
to
say
anything
about
the
shelley
doctrine.
when
mr.
wirin's
turn
comes,
i
think,
he
will
take
care
of
that.
i'm
going
to
say
very
little
about
separability,
because
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
solicitor
general
may
touch
on
that
subject.
separability
or
severability,
of
course,
is
a
state
question,
but
i
would
like
to
just
devote,
to
explain
what
it
was
that
the
court
below
held
in
respect
to
severability.
section
26
contains
not
a
single
word
of
repeal.
it
doesn't
say
the
rumford
act
is
repealed,
the
unruh
act
is
repealed
or
anything
else
is
repealed.
it
lays
down
a
general
proposition
that
the
right
--
the
right
to
refuse
to
sell,
shall
not
be
limited,
abridged,
or
impaired
by
any
of
--
by
the
state
or
any
of
its
agencies.
the
reason
rumford
and
unruh
are
deemed
to
be
repealed
by
that,
is
because
they
are
inconsistent
with
that
substantive
proposition
of
law
enacted
by
section
26.
now,
it
is
that
substantive
proposition
that
involves
the
state
by
our
submission,
that
involves
the
state
in
the
private
conduct,
and
therefore,
it
is
that
substantive
proposition
of
law
that
raises
the
constitutional
questions
that
are
being
argued
here.
unless
--
unless
that
substantive
provision
is
itself
valid,
there
can
be
no
repeal
because
repeal
is
a
function
of
the
--
is
a
function
of
the
substantive
provision.
what
the
california
court
held
was,
and
this
is
california
law,
and
it
may
be
good
law
or
bad
law,
but
it's
california
law
and
for
this
purpose,
it's
conclusive,
because
severability
is
a
state
question.
what
the
california
court
held
and
all
that
it
held,
this
discussion
will
be
found
on
pages
29,
30,
and
31
of
the
record
in
this
case.
then
they
did
not
go
in
the
law
or
in
the
convolutions
to
which
mr.
pruitt
referred,
at
least,
not
as
i
read
the
opinion.
what
it
did
hold
was
simply
this,
that
we
can't
rewrite
the
statute.
if
we
can
excise
the
part
that
renders
the
statute
unconstitutional,
and
what
is
left
is
constitutional,
we
will
give
force
to
what
is
left.
but
here,
here
is
the
thing
that's
unconstitutional.
the
part
of
the
statute
that's
unconstitutional
is
this
one
sentence
that
establishes
the
substantive
proposition
of
law.
excise
that
from
the
statute
and
there's
nothing
left
to
effect
that
it'd
repeal.
that
was
the
california
court's
decision
on
severability
and
as
--
in
complete
accord
with
the
california
decision,
and
it
is
entirely
a
matter
for
the
state
court.
now,
i
have
i
think
a
moment
or
two
before
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
invoke
every
ground
that
is
properly
in
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
some
of
the
grounds
that
the
--
some
of
them
--
at
least
one
of
them
is
a
ground
that
the
california
court
expressly
disagreed
within
in
its
opinion.
that's
the
question
of
a
--
that's
a
question
of
an
affirmative
duty
to
protect.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
one
of
them
is
a
ground
with
which
they
disagreed
by
ignoring
it.
that
is
what
i
call
purposeful
repeal.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
purposeful
repeal?
well,
it
involves
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
true.
but
when
i
say
that
i've
local
grounds,
your
honor,
i
am
simply
plagiarizing
a
comment
made
by
a
district
judge
in
a
record
with
which
i
once
had
the
deal.
what
he's
saying
in
objection,
he
invoked
all
ground,
so
i
do
the
same
thing
here,
your
honor,
and
i
think
with
precedent.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
--
i'm
hopeful.
i
hope
that
your
honor's
analysis
of
the
opinion
is
correct.
it
is
not
expressed
in
the
opinion.
it
is
not
expressed
in
the
(inaudible)
opinion
but
one
in
mulkey.
my
only
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
the
hill
case,
so
the
absent
--
absent
any
legislation
on
the
subject,
there
was
--
there
was
no
common-law
action.
there
was
no
action
in
california
for
a
relief
on
account
of
the
racial
discrimination.
and
hill
didn't
bring
himself
within
the
particular
statute
there
because
he
had
--
he
didn't
have
--
he
didn't
have
the
records
of
type
--
the
records
of
type
of
dwelling
that
was
involved
in
the
statute
--
and
the
legislation
that
applied
in
california.
and
the
argument
that
california
was
obligated
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
providing
with
protection
against
this
--
against
private
racial
--
disqualification
is
expressly
rejected
in
--
in
the
amending,
the
modified
hill
opinion,
the
modification
of
the
hill
opinion.
i
don't
say
to
question
about
--
that
california,
at
least,
with
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
that
there
was
no
obligation
in
the
court
of
california
to
provide
--
provide
a
remedy
for
private
racial
discrimination.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
and
i
then
take
that.
i
take
that
as
a
rejection
of
our
argument
because
it
had
been
argued
at
length
in
the
briefs
and
at
length
in
the
--
in
the
oral
argument.
on
purposeful
repeal,
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
a
rejection
is
they're
silent
on
that
subject,
plus
the
comment
of
mr.
justice
peters'
from
the
bench
to
which
i
refer.
but
the
grounds
in
here,
in
the
record
here,
and
if
they
are
good
grounds,
this
court
is
not
confined
to
the
grounds
used
by
the
lower
court,
although
i
agree
with,
i
think,
the
implication
of
mr.
justice
white's
comment
that
perhaps
on
the
question
of
purposeful
repeal,
the
california
court's
silence
ought
to
be
given
some
significance
in
view
of
their,
presumably,
greater
knowledge
of
local
conditions
of
circumstances,
particularly
the
circumstances
that
produced
section
26.
although,
those
circumstances
were
pretty
thoroughly
presented
to
the
court
by
a
way
of
--
by
way
of
a
request
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh
no
--
no,
i
--
i
don't
want
ever
to
give
that
up,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
clearest
amongst
direct
evidence
of
the
purpose
of
section
26
and
the
reason
that
i
think
it
is
so
significant
because
as
i
said,
that
seems
it's
quite
a
long
time.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i'm
sure
that
the
court
--
i'm
sure
that
the
court
--
i'll
be
candid.
i'm
sure
that
the
court
would
avail
this
--
would
have
availed
itself
of
every
tenable
ground
that
it
thought
would
support
as
a
result
and
it
didn't
put
its
decision
on
that
ground.
i
must
confess
that
that
makes
me
think
nonetheless
of
the
argument
that
we
made,
but
that
is
the
fact.
they
didn't
adopt
the
argument.
