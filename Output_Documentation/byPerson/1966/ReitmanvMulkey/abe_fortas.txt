justice
abe
fortas
so
again,
an
individual
restricted
come
in
no
proof
concerted
action
this
would
prohibit.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
good
as
saying
that
no
--
no
property
owner
can
insert
in
the
expected
covenant
based
on
rights.
now,
this
would
make
a
non-enforcement.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
but
what
it
does
do
is
to
inhibit
the
state
from
not
knowing
restrictive
covenants
if
the
--
in
--
in
an
individual
lease
or
in
an
individual
deed.
the
state
cannot
outlaw
restrictive
covenants
as
i
read
this.
justice
abe
fortas
--
under
a
restrictive
covenant
a
property
owner
declares
in
effect
that
he
will
not
sell
to
--
and
somebody
accepts
on
a
deed
with
the
restrictive
covenant.
in
other
words,
that
his
bearing
is
to
declare
that
he
will
not
sell
to
a
--
a
negro.and
as
i
understand,
as
i
read
the
statute
that
--
for
an
arguable
that
the
state
will
have
no
power
to
an
enact
such
law
but
then
enact
such
law
it
would
not
be
enforceable.
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
permit
that
kind
of
covenant,
but
what
it
says
by
constitutional
provision
is
that
the
individual
may
sell,
lease,
or
rent
in
his
property
as
he
chooses,
regardless
of
what
the
state
has
provided.
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
agree
that
the
phrase
neither
the
state
nor
any
subdivision
or
agency
includes
state
courts?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
binding
on
the
state
courts,
too.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
this
was
applied
--
your
argument
would
apply
equally
to
a
hotel
in
san
francisco,
let's
say,
in
los
angeles
that
said
that
it
won't
rent
a
room
for
a
negro,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
assumed,
sorry.
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
did
california
adopt
the
constitutional
provision
of
anything,
whether
it's
valid
in
the
face
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
all
this
--
suppose
all
the
constitutional
amendment
have
then
was
to
repeal
pro
tanto
the
unruh
and
the
rumford
act,
would
your
argument
still
apply?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
a
little
harder,
isn't
it,
to
maintain
that
on
my
suppositious
case
that
they
say
the
constitution
--
this
amendment
just
repealed
pro
tanto,
unruh
and
rumford,
than
it
to
when
you
--
when
the
constitution
amendment
does
as
it
does
here,
which
is
to
prescribe
a
across-the-board
--
across-the-board
innovation.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
indication
that
where
--
as
to
whether
there
was
a
common-law
right
of
action
in
california
without
reference
to
unruh
or
rumford
that
would
affect
the
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
it,
mr.
selvin,
isn't
it
just
that
it's
told
its
people,
but
rather
that
the
people
have
told
their
legislature
that
the
legislature
which
is
the
ordinary
body
of
the
law-making
may
not
have
to
implement
what
might
have
(inaudible)
by
law
are
federal
guarantees.
the
state
action
in
that
sense,
i
assume
people
can
tell
the
people
anytime
they
want
to.
but
here,
what
the
people
have
done
is
to
say
that
the
ordinary
process
is
in
the
state,
that
is
say,
the
enactment
of
legislation
shall
not
be
available
for
the
purpose
of
well,
preventing
racial
discrimination.
justice
abe
fortas
well
by
this
--
excuse
me
mr.
wirin,
but
by
this
action
the
people
of
california,
i
suppose
it's
arguable,
have
removed
from
the
ordinary
legislative
process,
this
subject
of
legislation
in
the
field
of
discrimination
with
respect
to
rental,
lease,
or
sale
of
property.
and
they
have
similarly,
if
i
understand
the
argument,
have
removed
that
subject
from
the
jurisdiction
of
their
courts.
now
the
question
is,
whether
that
removal
of
this
subject
from
the
ordinary
state
processes
is
state
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
seemed
--
it
seemed
to
me
that
that
is
one
of
the
questions
here
now.
now,
perhaps
similarly
i
suppose
that
if
the
federal
government
passed
a
statute
on
this
subject
with
respect
to
discrimination
in
housing
and
the
area
of
this
section
that
the
effect
of
this
constitutional
provision
would
mean
that
regardless
of
what
the
legislature
of
california
might
want
to
do,
that
california
could
not
--
the
california
courts
could
not
cooperate
in
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
statute
by
virtue
of
their
jurisdiction
without
saying
that
the
resolution
is
pro
tanto
and
valid
as
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law.
i
don't
know
where
they
come
out
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
general,
are
you
saying
that
the
effect
of
putting
this
in
the
constitution,
the
state
action,
putting
this
in
the
constitution
as
state
action,
and
the
reason
why
it's
state
action
is
that
it
has
removed
the
subject
matter
from
the
reach
of
the
ordinary
governmental
processes
in
the
state
of
california,
namely
the
legislature
and
the
courts?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
executive.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
arguing
the
same
whether
the
--
under
the
unruh
law,
prior
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
general,
is
it
clear
that
california
legislature
could
deprive
its
courts
a
jurisdiction
in
obtaining
common
law
action?
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
require
a
constitutional
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
how
--
how
can
you
read
that
exception
under
the
statute?
is
there
any
language
in
here
or
--
because
the
language
seems
to
be
about
as
broad
as
it
can
be
phrased.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
--
this
one
is
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
a
constitutional
provision.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
says
that,
“neither
the
state
nor
any
subdivision
or
agency.”
and
would
you
construe
that
to
mean
to
--
not
to
apply
to
the
courts?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
is
--
and
your
argument
then
compared
to
what
has
been
said
by
the
counsel
that
this
--
that
the
phrase,
“neither
the
state
nor
any
subdivision
or
agency”
does
not
include
courts
in
the
exercise
of
their
own
jurisdiction
as
we
say
is
from
enforcing
state
action.
justice
abe
fortas
and
to
the
extent
that
the
supremacy
clause
is
not
involved.
this
constitutional
provision
does
remove
in
the
california
court
common
law
jurisdiction.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
--
(inaudible)
--
that
is
a
meaningful
distinction
and
maybe
i'll
contend
that
it's
not.
justice
abe
fortas
so
again,
an
individual
restricted
come
in
no
proof
concerted
action
this
would
prohibit.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
good
as

that

justice
abe
fortas
i

that.
but
what
it
does
do
is
to
inhibit
the
state
from
not
knowing
restrictive
covenants
if
the
--
in
--
in
an
individual
lease
or
in
an
individual
deed.
the
state
cannot
outlaw
restrictive
covenants
as
i
read
this.
justice
abe
fortas
--
under
a
restrictive
covenant
a
property
owner
declares
in
effect
that
he
will
not
sell
to
--
and
somebody
accepts
on
a
deed
with
the
restrictive
covenant.
in
other
words,
that
his
bearing
is
to

that

justice
abe
fortas
but
then
permit
that

of

but
what
it
says
by

is
that
the
individual
may
sell,
lease,
or
rent
in
his
property
as
he
chooses,

(inaudible)
justice

do
you
