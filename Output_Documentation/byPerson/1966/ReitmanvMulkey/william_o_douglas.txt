justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
anything
in
this
record
concerning
the
--
neither
these
cases,
concerning
the
nature
of
these
--
are
these
properties
in
any
way
publicly
financed
in
mortgages
or
otherwise?
justice
william
o.
douglas
either
state
or
federal?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
this
--
would
this
proposition
14
be
broad
enough
to
make
it
possible,
say,
for
hertz
and
avis
or
any
of
those
other
companies
to
refuse
to
rent
a
car
to
a
person
because
of
his
race?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
to
only
real
property?
justice
william
o.
douglas
just
--
just
real
property?
justice
william
o.
douglas
not
--
not
personal
property?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
both
of
these
properties
are
apartment
buildings?
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
shouldn't
we
look
at
it
in
another
way
irrespective
of
history
that
--
what
california
maybe
doing.
i
don't
know
too
much
about
this,
but
what
california
may
be
doing
is
--
is
taking
out
of
the
hands
of
private
people
the
zoning
function.
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
shelley
and
kraemer
of
his
zoning?
shelley
and
kraemer
of
his
zoning?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
don't
claim
--
we
don't
want
shelley
and
kraemer
overruled?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
your
argument
distinguish
them,
apart
from
that
exception
that
those
who
are
in
the
business
of
renting
apartments
are
different
from
those
who
are
in
the
business
of
renting
hotel
rooms
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
or
theory?
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
you
get
into
this
field
of
the
apartment
house
activities,
you're
certainly
getting
pretty
far
away
from
the
picture
of
the
old
log
cabin
and
the
--
the
owner's
right
to
dispose
of
them,
aren't
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it's
more
than
that
is
what
the
--
it's
more
of
a
rental
policy,
isn't
it?
we're
dealing
with
the
rental
of
apartments,
aren't
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yeah.
but
these
are
not
the
sale
of
cooperative
apartments,
are
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
it
is
a
phase
of
the
larger
housing
problem.
