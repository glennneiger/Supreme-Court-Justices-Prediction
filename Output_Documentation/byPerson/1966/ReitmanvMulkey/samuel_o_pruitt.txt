mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
overriding
issue
we
have
in
these
cases
today
is,
we
submit,
more
fundamental
to
the
plan
of
government
we
have
chosen
for
ourselves
and
the
troubling
question
of
racial
discrimination
that's
also
involved.
now,
these
issues
are
raised
by
two
cases
which
are
the
subject
of
the
joint
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
one
was
instituted
in
1963
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
measure
which
has
been
invalidated
by
the
court
below.
it
was
a
suit
for
damages
and
injunctive
relief
against
mr.
reitman,
the
owner
of
a
multiple
dwelling
apartment,
for
refusal
to
rent
an
apartment
to
mr.
and
mrs.
mulkey,
solely
upon
the
grounds
of
their
race.
that
case
was
at
issue
and
untried
at
the
time
in
november
1964,
when
by
popular
vote,
the
people
of
california
adopted
a
measure
popularly
known
as
proposition
14,
adding
to
the
state
constitution
in
section
26
of
article
i
of
that
constitution.
shortly
thereafter,
mr.
snyder,
the
other
petitioner
in
this
case,
who
owned
a
six-and-a-half
unit
building
in
an
apartment
dwelling
in
beverly
hills,
set
a
notice
of
termination
to
mr.
and
mrs.
prendergast
of
being
a
negro
and
a
caucasian
married
couple.
and
after
the
receipt
of
that
notice,
mr.
and
mrs.
prendergast
filed
an
action
for
injunctive
relief
to
enjoin
the
termination
of
this
oral
tenancy
which
under
california
laws
is
terminable
on
a
30-day
written
notice.
both
of
--
the
rights
claimed
by
both
of
these
plaintiffs
in
both
actions
was
based
exclusively
on
the
provisions
of
a
california
statute
as
amended
in
1959,
known
and
referred
to
in
our
brief
as
the
unruh
act,
which
started
of
in
1893,
i
believe,
as
a
typical
public
accommodation
statute
preventing
racial
discrimination
in
all
places
of
public
accommodation.
and
in
1959
was
amended
by
the
california
legislature
to
prohibit
racial
and
religious
discrimination
in
business
establishments
of
every
kind
whatsoever.
within
a
couple
of
years
after
that
the
statute
was
passed,
the
california
courts
construed
it
to
include,
among
other
businesses,
the
business
of
renting
multiple
dwellings
as
small
as
three-unit
dwellings.
accordingly,
these
actions
were
brought
and
as
i
say
or
the
plaintiffs
relied
exclusively
on
the
provisions
of
statutes
adopted
in
1959.
as
i
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
the
rumford
act
was
adopted,
your
honor,
in
1963,
to
extend
the
so-called
hawkins
act
which
was
an
act
adopted
at
the
same
time
as
the
unruh
act,
the
hawkins
act
prohibiting
racial
discrimination
in
publicly
assisted
housing
accommodations.
in
june
1963,
the
california
legislature
adopted
what's
known
as
the
rumford
act
extending
the
provisions
of
the
hawkins
act
to
include
certain
types
of
private
dwellings.
now,
the
unruh
act
is
the
act
under
which
both
of
these
actions
were
brought.
and
under
the
provisions
of
the
rumford
act,
a
complainant
is
giving
his
--
given
his
option
whether
to
proceed
under
the
provisions
of
the
unruh
act,
if
he's
dealing
with
what
concept
--
with
a
business
establishment
or
to
proceed
with
an
administrative
agency
the
fair
employment
practices
commission
if
he
wishes
the
remedy
provided
for
in
the
rumford
act.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
the
position,
i
believe,
of
the
attorney
general
of
california
and
of
the
fair
employment
practices
commission.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
specifically
that
they
violate
the
unruh
act.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
now,
the
court
--
the
trial
courts
in
the
--
in
the
--
the
reitman
case,
mulkey
v.
reitman,
as
it
is
known,
if
the
court
you
will,
entertained
a
motion
which
for
practical
purposes
was
a
motion
for
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings
filed
by
the
defendant
following
the
adoption
of
this
constitutional
amendment,
it
being
urged,
that
this
amendment,
at
the
very
least,
had
the
effect
of
repealing,
pro
tanto,
the
provisions
of
the
unruh
act,
which
as
i
said,
was
the
exclusive
basis
for
the
complaint.
the
issue,
as
treated
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
parties,
was
based
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
urged
that
the
measure
was
unconstitutional
and
did
not
validly
affect
the
repeal.
the
defendant
urged
that
it
was
valid
under
the
federal
constitution
and
that
--
that
it
did
affect
the
repeal.
the
trial
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
entered
judgment
for
the
defendant.
that
judgment
was
reversed
by
the
california
supreme
court
on
the
grounds
of
section
26
did
not
accomplish
a
repeal,
because
it
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
is
one
of
the
judgments
here
on
review.
in
the
prendergast
case,
the
landlord
filed
a
cross-complaint,
in
which
he
took
the
position
that
he
had
a
right
to
terminate
an
oral
tenancy
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason
at
all,
unless
it
was
prohibited
by
some
valid,
regulatory
statute,
adopted
under
some
constitutional
grant
of
power
and
relying
on
the
theory,
of
course,
that
section
26
had
repealed
any
such
regulatory
statute.
therefore,
the
state
of
the
law
was
that
there
was
no
statute
on
the
subject
and
he
cross-complained
for
declaratory
relief
that
he'd
be
given
possession
of
his
property,
having
validly
terminated
the
tenancy.
the
trial
court
in
that
case,
although
it
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
section
26
and
a
companion
case,
held
that
section
26
was
inapplicable
to
this
situation,
but
then
under
there's
the
doctrine
of
--
under
his
interpretation
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
shelley
versus
kraemer,
as
--
as
interpreted
by
what
the
intermediate
appellate
court
of
california
in
the
abstract
development
company
case
cited
in
our
brief
that
even
though
there
was
no
statute
preventing
a
termination
of
this
lease
on
racial
ground.
even
though
it
was
--
it
was
not
subject
to
statutory
regulation
or
to
put
it
another
way,
even
if
they
had
a
right
to
do
it
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason
at
all,
that
nevertheless,
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibited
a
state
court
from
recognizing
the
termination
of
the
tenancy
if
it
were
based
on
racial
considerations.
that
judgment
was
appealed
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
was
affirmed,
not
only
on
the
ground
relied
upon
by
the
trial
court,
but
also
upon
the
ground
that
section
26,
appended
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
if
i
might
mention,
just
briefly
the
court
below,
relied
very
heavily
on
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
douglas.
both
--
both
properties
are
privately
owned,
privately
paid
for,
privately
maintained,
have
no
government
financial
assistance
of
any
kind.
there's
no
evidence
that
they
do
such
evidences.
there
is,
in
the
case
that
neither
property
had
any
such
financing.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
either
state
or
federal.
and
it
was
so
treated
by
the
court
below.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
--
i
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
yes.
the
--
in
other
words,
this
--
i've
outlined
the
affects
of
these
cases.
the
narrow
issue
that
would
determine
these
two
cases
would
be,
does
section
26
validly
effect
a
repeal
of
the
unruh
act
insofar
as
it
applied
to
housing
accommodations
because
if
invalidly
accomplished
a
repeal,
it
may
be
invalid
on
some
other
theory,
but
the
repealing
effect
would
enable
the
court
to
make
a
judgment
in
this
case
on
the
facts
of
these
cases.
so,
there
is
a
question
whether
the
repealing
effect
of
section
26,
which
i
believe
the
respondents
and
all
the
friends
of
the
court
in
this
case,
conceived
that
it
was
intended
to
effect
a
pro
tanto
repeal
of
the
pre-existing
legislation.
and
there
is
a
question
of
whether
that
effect
can
be
severed
from
whatever
else
there
is
in
the
measure
that
this
court
might
believe
to
append
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
measure
is
limited
to
one
type
of
conduct
and
one.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
relates
only
to
the
decision
of
the
owner
of
residential
property
respecting
the
disposition
of
his
own
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
just
real
property,
real
residential
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
not
personal
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
below
as
i
analyzed
the
opinion
if
we
spelled
it
out
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
didn't
reach
the
question
of
severability
of
the
repealing
effects
from
the
balance
of
the
measure,
because
it
held
that
the
repealing
effect
was
--
was
the
unconstitutional
part
of
it.
so,
accordingly,
if
didn't
have
to
say
whether
it
was
severable
or
not.
it
held
it
was
invalid.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
--
would
say
mr.
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
but
i
--
they
were
talking
about
different
severability,
point
1,
which
i
might
add
was
never
argued
but
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
there
are
three
severability
points
that
could
be
involved
in
this
case.
one
was
the
severability
point
treated
by
the
court
below
which
was,
any
--
any
of
the
practice
provision
may
have
in
lifting
regulation
of
racial
discrimination
is
unconstitutional.
now,
it
may
be
that
it
would
be
valid
if,
for
example,
a
landlord
refused
to
rent
to
someone
because
they
had
too
many
children.
there
would
be
a
valid
application.
it
said
that
the
racial
and
the
non-racial
aspects
of
it
could
not
be
severed.
the
other
severability
problem
is
one
that
i've
just
mentioned,
the
question
of
whether
the
repealing
effect
can
be
severed
from
the
balance
of
the
measure.
and
the
third
problem
assuming
that
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
third,
the
measure
has
three
purposes
and
three
purposes
only.
one,
was
to
re-establish
a
long-standing
common-law
rule
up
until
1959
in
california
and
41
other
states,
i
understand.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
it
did
three
things.
it
re-established
the
common-law
rule
that
a
property
owner
had
the
freedom
to
--
in
the
disposition
of
his
property
to
choose
to
--
with
whom
he
would
deal,
in
any
respect
he
chose,
so
long
as
it
was
not
prohibited
by
some
valid
law.
that's
purpose
number
one.
purpose
number
two
was
to
effect
a
repeal
of
any
inconsistent
provisions
of
previous
legislative
activity.
three,
the
purpose
was
to
reserve
to
the
people
acting
as
the
legislative
body
to
enact
any
future
regulatory
legislation
which
would
affect
the
right
of
a
property
owner
to
dispose
of
his
property
in
such
manner
as
he
chose.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
effect
of
the
law
that
is
created
by
that
they
are
the
same.
yes.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
probably
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
--
the
snyder
property
is
described
in
the
record
as
a
six-and-a-half
unit
dwelling
and
i
believe
i
said
it
was
in
beverly
hills.
it's
in
the
--
los
angeles
near
beverly
hills.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
the
other
building
is
in
santa
ana
about
45
--
about
30
miles
from
los
angeles.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
in
orange
county
and
i
don't
believe
there's
any
data
in
the
record
as
to
the
description
of
that
property,
but
i
understand
it's
a
multiple
unit
dwelling
containing,
perhaps,
10
units.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
suppose
you
would
--
that
would
be
accurate
except
in
the
--
in
the
prendergast
case,
mr.
--
the
evidence
in
the
record
as
mr.
and
mrs.
snyder
purchased
this
property
as
an
investment
in
their
retirement
that
they
intend
to
move
into
one
of
the
apartments
and
they
have
been
highly
selective
in
choosing
the
people
that
lived
in
the
balance
of
the
apartments
because
they
expect
it
to
be
their
home
as
well
as
income
property.
there's
no
evidence
on
the
mulkey
case
as
to
(inaudible)
of
the
issue.
now,
the
rationale
of
the
california
supreme
court
invalidating
this
measure
was
that
california
became
responsible
for
the
racial
discrimination
of
these
petitioners
because
california
had
taken
what
it
called
affirmative
action
of
a
legislative
nature
designed
to
make
possible
discriminatory
conduct
which
had
previously
been
prohibited
by
statute.
the
implication,
of
course,
from
that
kind
of
language
is,
had
there
been
no
such
statute,
then
there
would
no
constitutional
invalidity
in
section
26.
indeed,
the
court
says,
by
way
of
dictum
in
the
mulkey
opinion
and
by
way
of
holding
in
a
companion
case
entitled
hill
versus
miller
that
the
state
had
no
--
affirmative
constitutional
duty
to
provide
a
remedy
against
private
racial
discrimination
it
held.
and
that,
in
california,
there
is
no
right
of
action
for
--
by
a
negro,
for
example,
against
the
property
owner
for
racial
discrimination
in
housing
accepting
only
as
it's
regulated
by
statute.
so,
as
we
said
before,
we
think
the
rationale
of
the
court
below
was
a
repeal
of
these
statutes.
this
reversible
of
policy,
as
they
put
it,
from
one
where
california
had
first
prohibited
racial
discrimination,
then,
they
adopted
section
26
which
lifted
this
prohibition
that
that
change
of
direction
made
california
responsible
for
racial
discrimination
that
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
of
course,
that's
been
urged,
mr.
justice
douglas,
but
i
think
the
--
the
zoning
function
is
substantially
different
from
independent
choices
of
independent
people
with
respect
to
their
properties.
the
zoning
function,
of
course,
and
i
think
the
most
significant
part
of
the
zoning
function
is
that
it
emanates
directly
from
the
government,
number
one.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
that's
also
because
the
reason
that
was
enforced
against
a
willing
buyer
and
willing
seller
who
did
not
wish
to
practice
racial
discrimination,
the
only
reason
that
was
effective
is
because
the
state
court
prohibit
trades
to
prohibit
them
from
consummating
the
transaction.
there
again,
you
have
coercion
emanating
from
the
state,
and
when
that
happens,
we
do
not
claim
that
there
is
no
clear
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
we
don't
want
to
extend
it
as
it
was,
but
the
california
supreme
court
ruled,
however.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
there's
a
willing
seller
and
a
willing
buyer
who
wanted
to
consummate
a
transaction
and
the
state
court
intervened
and
said,
"you
can't
do
it."
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
white
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
measure
says
private
discrimination
is
hereby
authorized.
what
it
says
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
what
it
says
is
that
freedom
of
choice
by
a
property
owner
shall
not
be
regulated
by
the
state.
that
is
--
that
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
you
may
act
arbitrarily
with
this
freedom
of
giving.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
--
so
this
--
this
proposition
says
--
now,
it
says
private
discriminations
are
authorized.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
i
think
it's
over
--
oh,
i
think
it
authorizes
free
speech,
certainly.
it's
an
oversimplification
to
say
that
--
that
this
authorizes
racial
discrimination.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
not
according
to
our
view.
that
it
operates
only
with
respect
to
the
independent
position
of
a
private
property
owner
with
respect
to
a
disposition
of
his
own
private
property?
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
he
could
not.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
in
using
the
--
the
measure
reads.
neither
the
state
nor
any
agency
thereof
shall
deny
the
right
of
any
person
to
sell
or
rent
any
part
or
all
of
his
real
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
to
such
person
or
persons
as
he
and
his
absolute
discretion
chooses.
so
we
construe
that
to
mean
that
it
relates
solely
to
the
decision
of
the
property
owner
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
his
property,
wouldn't
permit
concerted
activity
by
a
neighborhood
of
property
owners
because
in
that
event,
that
would
cover
more
than
any
right
to
dispose
of
his
properties.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
yes.
there
--
there
is
already
such
a
statute
in
california
from
this
point.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
yes.
it
was
adopted,
i
believe
in
1963
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
it's
unaffected
by
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
i
don't
--
i
don't
so
read
the
measure,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
believe
the
court
below
did
and
i
don't
believe
anybody
has
contended
that
it
did.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
--
that
may
be
a
reason
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
his
property,
but
there's
no
way
that
i
know
that
it
could
be
done
in
combination
or
concert
so
as
to
restrict
the
sale
or
disposition
of
an
aggregate
of
property
merely
because
all
of
the
property
owners
had
agreed
to
act
accordingly.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
it
occurred
--
there
was
a
concerted
activity
of
any
kind.
i'm
talking
about
the
individual
right
of
an
individual
property
with
respect
to
his
property.
and
i
think
if
concerted
action
were
established,
we
have
a
different
case
than
we
have
before
us
today.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
you
mean
the
owner
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
approach
justice
fortas,
but
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
--
the
measure
gives
a
property
owner
the
right
not
to
enter
into
a
contract
of
sale
of
his
own
property
for
whatever
reason.
it
does
not
give
him
a
right,
however,
to
reduce
or
perform
a
contract
that
he
has
entered
into.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
would
and
if
i
follow
you
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
now
we
--
i
don't
read
that
it
permits
that
kind
of
covenant,
mr.
justice
fortas,
particularly
in
view
of
the
effect
that
a
statute,
specifically
outlaws
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
certainly
would
prevent
a
court
from
enforcing
any
breach
of
that
covenant
and
not
withstanding,
the
federal
rule
because
that
would
be
state
interference
with
the
transferee's
right
to
dispose
of
his
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
yes.
as
i
was
saying,
the
basic
purpose
of
the
measure
aside
from
reserving
to
the
people,
the
right
to
change
the
rule
in
the
future.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
to
change
this
common-law
rule
in
the
future.
the
basic
purpose
of
this
measure
was
to
re-establish
in
california
this
long-standing
common-law
rule.
this
rule,
as
we
see
it,
relates
solely
to
the
conduct
of
private
persons
with
respect
to
private
property
in
their
dealings
with
other
private
individuals.
and
accordingly,
it's
not
within
the
frame
of
reference
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
are
assuming
and
the
court
below
so
held
as
we
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
recently
as
the
last
term.
this
court
has
held
in
effect
that
there
is
no
self-executing
right
of
action
under
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
favor
of
a
private
person
who
is
denied
access
to
private
property
for
a
reason
which
could
not
properly
be
relied
upon
by
the
state
under
the
fourteenth.
from
that
assumption,
the
question
becomes
whether
the
common-law
rule
becomes
offensive
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
when
a
state
first
modifies
the
common-law
rule
by
adopting
a
statute
and
thereafter,
re-establishes
the
common-law
rule
by
repealing
the
statute.
here
again,
it
seems
on
analysis,
there
is
no
violation
by
the
state
of
any
federal
right
of
the
person
discriminated
against.
while
this
common-law
was
rule
--
was
in
effect,
he
had
no
federal
rights.
while
the
statutory
is
in
effect,
he
had
only
a
state
right
under
that
statute
--
under
that
statute.
and
so
it
should
follow
that
after
the
statute
is
repealed,
that
it
still
has
no
federal
right
of
action.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
this
measure
is
specifically
excludes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
all
places
of
public
accommodation
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
and
places
providing
transient
lodging,
accommodations
by
a
hotel
and
a
motel
or
other
similar
public
places
that
excludes
public
accommodations,
that
excludes
property
owned
by
the
state.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
--
that
this
constitutional
question
would
be
substantially
the
same
with
respect
to
public
accommodations
and
business
rentals.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
public
accommodations
in
this
case
is
a
little
easier
to
decide
there
is
a
constitutional
question,
than
private
residential
property
--
with
property
which
never
had
normally
been
opened
to
the
public
on
a
--
on
a
transitory
basis
or
kind
of
the
like
public
accommodations.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct,
certainly.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
of
course,
i
think
in
the
absence
of
federal
activity
in
that
area
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
access,
to
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
private
--
public,
privately
owned
public
accommodation
under
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
it
relates
everywhere.
however,
though,
mr.
justice
douglas,
from
the
rental
of
a
room
in
your
own
home
where
your
family
lives
to
a
multiple
apartment
building
of
a
great
size
and
obviously,
a
business
entity,
but
as
we
shall
indicate,
we
think
the
constitution
doesn't
draw
the
line
as
to
where
those
conduct
is
proper
and
where
it
isn't
proper.
that
is
strictly
a
legislative
matter
either
by
congress
under
a
constitutional
grant
of
power
or
by
the
state
acting
under
its
police
power
to
decide
which
of
this
--
what
--
what
portion
of
this
conduct,
if
any,
should
be
prohibited
by
the
imposition
of
governmental
sanction.
now,
the
court
below,
in
holding
that
this
reversal
of
legislative
policy
was
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
creates
an
anomalous
result,
it
seems
to
us,
that
would
in
effect,
make
it
possible
for
any
local
legislature,
any
place
in
the
country.
to
create
a
federal
constitutional
right
by
adopting
a
regulatory
statute
which
should
have
no
constitutional
mandate
to
adopt,
and
thereafter,
repealing
it.
thus,
it's
--
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
a
species
of
federal
right
that
can
be
created
merely
because
a
particular
majority
of
a
temporary
legislature
adopts
a
regulatory
statute
and
then
repeals
it.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
the
california
supreme
court,
speaking
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
as
i
read
their
decision
that
there
would
be
no
constitutional
difficulty
with
this
measure
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
there
was
a
statute
enacted.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
the
constitutional
right,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
constitutional
right
which
the
california
court
said,
this
respondent
said,
was
the
right
to
have
that
statute
prohibiting
the
conduct
of
petitioners
stay
in
effect,
notwithstanding
the
effort
of
the
people
to
repeal
it.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
not
to
have
it
repealed.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
has
the
same
effect,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
and
so
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
according
to
the
theory
of
the
court
below,
this
would
vary
from
place-to-place.
there'd
be
no
such
constitutional
right
in
illinois,
for
example,
or
in
texas
because
they
don't
have
any
regulation
on
the
subject.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
that
all
it
says.
and
it
doesn't
go
even
quite
that
far.
it
repeals
a
portion
of
the
unruh
and
rumford
act
to
wit,
the
portion
relating
to
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
we
do,
your
honor.
when
i
read
it
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
would
say
yes,
unless
that
has
the
effect
of
encouraging
people
to
discriminate
in
a
way
that's
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
don't
think
this
measure
does
that.
the
way
your
honor
quoted,
it
might.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.i
believe
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
should
(inaudible),
but
that
is
not
what
this
measure
does.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
the
state
--
the
state
authorizing
the
use
of
its
coercive
power
to
prohibit
a
citizen
of
this
country
from
acquiring
property,
solely
on
grounds
of
this
race.
that
would
be
the
constitutional
defect
in
that
measure.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
in
these
two
cases
we
are
all
of
a
measure,
would
cover
a
sale,
as
well.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
these
two
cases
here
are
rentals,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
month-to-month
rentals
of
these
apartments.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes,
it
is
that.
but
this
provision,
mr.
justice
black,
is
nothing
more
than
a
statement
in
the
california
constitution
of
what
the
common-law
rule
is
in
41
states
of
the
union
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
that
is
correct.
it
gives
the
property
owner
the
freedom
to
choose
and
i
should
suggest
the
responsibility
to
act
wisely
in
the
exercise
of
his
freedom.
it's
the
same
as
any
other
free
conduct
that
we
recognize
in
this
country
that
merely
by
giving
people
freedom
from
governmental
regulation
doesn't
constitute
authorization
for
abuse
of
that
freedom.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
in
my
time.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
federal
plan
in
the
first
place,
the
problem
here
is
one
about
that
state
control,
at
least,
in
the
absence
of
congressional
legislation.
and
secondly,
that
in
this
area,
where
we're
not
talking
about
protecting
a
constitutional
right,
we're
talking
about
protecting
a
right
of
one
individual
against
another
individual.
but
in
that
broad
area
of
conduct,
the
legislature
is
the
proper
institution
of
government
to
decide
where
the
line
should
be
drawn.
the
legislature
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
i'm
saying
this
would
not
apply
where
we
have
a
constitutional
right
as
being
infringed
by
the
state.
it
would
not
apply,
for
example,
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
a
property
owner
who
had
a
constitutional
right
to
exclude
a
trespasser,
for
example,
for
any
reason.
but
in
the
broad
middle
area
of
conflicting
rights
and
responsibilities
as
between
individuals,
where
nobody
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
somebody
else
recognize
that
right,
but
only
a
right
to
have
it
if
the
law
says
that
certain
conduct
shall
be
permitted.
by
law,
i
say,
means
the
judgment
of
a
legislature,
not
the
judgment
of
a
court.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
overriding
issue
we
have
in
these
cases
today
is,
we
submit,
more
fundamental
to
the
plan
of
government
we
have
chosen
for
ourselves
and
the
troubling
question
of
racial
discrimination
that's
also
involved.
now,
these
issues
are
raised
by
two
cases
which
are
the
subject
of
the
joint
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
one
was
instituted
in
1963
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
measure
which
has
been
invalidated
by
the
court
below.
it
was
a
suit
for
damages
and
injunctive
relief
against
mr.
reitman,
the
owner
of
a
multiple
dwelling
apartment,
for
refusal
to
rent
an
apartment
to
mr.
and
mrs.
mulkey,
solely
upon
the
grounds
of
their
race.
that
case
was
at
issue
and
untried
at
the
time
in
november
1964,
when
by
popular
vote,
the
people
of
california
adopted
a
measure
popularly
known
as
proposition
14,
adding
to
the
state
constitution
in
section
26
of
article
i
of
that
constitution.
shortly
thereafter,
mr.
snyder,
the
other
petitioner
in
this
case,
who
owned
a
six-and-a-half
unit
building
in
an
apartment
dwelling
in
beverly
hills,
set
a
notice
of
termination
to
mr.
and
mrs.
prendergast
of
being
a
negro
and
a
caucasian
married
couple.
and
after
the
receipt
of
that
notice,
mr.
and
mrs.
prendergast
filed
an
action
for
injunctive
relief
to
enjoin
the
termination
of
this
oral
tenancy
which
under
california
laws
is
terminable
on
a
30-day
written
notice.
both
of
--
the
rights
claimed
by
both
of
these
plaintiffs
in
both
actions
was
based
exclusively
on
the
provisions
of
a
california
statute
as
amended
in
1959,
known
and
referred
to
in
our
brief
as
the
unruh
act,
which
started
of
in
1893,
i
believe,
as
a
typical
public
accommodation
statute
preventing
racial
discrimination
in
all
places
of
public
accommodation.
and
in
1959
was
amended
by
the
california
legislature
to
prohibit
racial
and
religious
discrimination
in
business
establishments
of
every
kind
whatsoever.
within
a
couple
of
years
after
that
the
statute
was
passed,
the
california
courts
construed
it
to
include,
among
other
businesses,
the
business
of
renting
multiple
dwellings
as
small
as
three-unit
dwellings.
accordingly,
these
actions
were
brought
and
as
i
say
or
the
plaintiffs
relied
exclusively
on
the
provisions
of
statutes
adopted
in
1959.
as
i
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
the
rumford
act
was
adopted,
your
honor,
in
1963,
to
extend
the
so-called
hawkins
act
which
was
an
act
adopted
at
the
same
time
as
the
unruh
act,
the
hawkins
act
prohibiting
racial
discrimination
in
publicly
assisted
housing
accommodations.
in
june
1963,
the
california
legislature
adopted
what's
known
as
the
rumford
act
extending
the
provisions
of
the
hawkins
act
to
include
certain
types
of
private
dwellings.
now,
the
unruh
act
is
the
act
under
which
both
of
these
actions
were
brought.
and
under
the
provisions
of
the
rumford
act,
a
complainant
is
giving
his
--
given
his
option
whether
to
proceed
under
the
provisions
of
the
unruh
act,
if
he's
dealing
with
what
concept
--
with
a
business
establishment
or
to
proceed
with
an
administrative
agency
the
fair
employment
practices
commission
if
he
wishes
the
remedy
provided
for
in
the
rumford
act.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
the
position,
i
believe,
of
the
attorney
general
of
california
and
of
the
fair
employment
practices
commission.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
specifically
that
they
violate
the
unruh
act.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
now,
the
court
--
the
trial
courts
in
the
--
in
the
--
the
reitman
case,
mulkey
v.
reitman,
as
it
is
known,
if
the
court
you
will,
entertained
a
motion
which
for
practical
purposes
was
a
motion
for
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings
filed
by
the
defendant
following
the
adoption
of
this
constitutional
amendment,
it
being
urged,
that
this
amendment,
at
the
very
least,
had
the
effect
of
repealing,
pro
tanto,
the
provisions
of
the
unruh
act,
which
as
i
said,
was
the
exclusive
basis
for
the
complaint.
the
issue,
as
treated
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
parties,
was
based
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
urged
that
the
measure
was
unconstitutional
and
did
not
validly
affect
the
repeal.
the
defendant
urged
that
it
was
valid
under
the
federal
constitution
and
that
--
that
it
did
affect
the
repeal.
the
trial
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
entered
judgment
for
the
defendant.
that
judgment
was
reversed
by
the
california
supreme
court
on
the
grounds
of
section
26
did
not
accomplish
a
repeal,
because
it
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
is
one
of
the
judgments
here
on
review.
in
the
prendergast
case,
the
landlord
filed
a
cross-complaint,
in
which
he
took
the
position
that
he
had
a
right
to
terminate
an
oral
tenancy
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason
at
all,
unless
it
was
prohibited
by
some
valid,
regulatory
statute,
adopted
under
some
constitutional
grant
of
power
and
relying
on
the
theory,
of
course,
that
section
26
had
repealed
any
such
regulatory
statute.
therefore,
the
state
of
the
law
was
that
there
was
no
statute
on
the
subject
and
he
cross-complained
for
declaratory
relief
that
he'd
be
given
possession
of
his
property,
having
validly
terminated
the
tenancy.
the
trial
court
in
that
case,
although
it
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
section
26
and
a
companion
case,
held
that
section
26
was
inapplicable
to
this
situation,
but
then
under
there's
the
doctrine
of
--
under
his
interpretation
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
shelley
versus
kraemer,
as
--
as
interpreted
by
what
the
intermediate
appellate
court
of
california
in
the
abstract
development
company
case
cited
in
our
brief
that
even
though
there
was
no
statute
preventing
a
termination
of
this
lease
on
racial
ground.
even
though
it
was
--
it
was
not
subject
to
statutory
regulation
or
to
put
it
another
way,
even
if
they
had
a
right
to
do
it
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason
at
all,
that
nevertheless,
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibited
a
state
court
from
recognizing
the
termination
of
the
tenancy
if
it
were
based
on
racial
considerations.
that
judgment
was
appealed
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
was
affirmed,
not
only
on
the
ground
relied
upon
by
the
trial
court,
but
also
upon
the
ground
that
section
26,
appended
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
if
i
might
mention,
just
briefly
the
court
below,
relied
very
heavily
on
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
douglas.
both
--
both
properties
are
privately
owned,
privately
paid
for,
privately
maintained,
have
no
government
financial
assistance
of
any
kind.
there's
no
evidence
that
they
do
such
evidences.
there
is,
in
the
case
that
neither
property
had
any
such
financing.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
either
state
or
federal.
and
it
was
so
treated
by
the
court
below.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
--
i
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
yes.
the
--
in
other
words,
this
--
i've
outlined
the
affects
of
these
cases.
the
narrow
issue
that
would
determine
these
two
cases
would
be,
does
section
26
validly
effect
a
repeal
of
the
unruh
act
insofar
as
it
applied
to
housing
accommodations
because
if
invalidly
accomplished
a
repeal,
it
may
be
invalid
on
some
other
theory,
but
the
repealing
effect
would
enable
the
court
to
make
a
judgment
in
this
case
on
the
facts
of
these
cases.
so,
there
is
a
question
whether
the
repealing
effect
of
section
26,
which
i
believe
the
respondents
and
all
the
friends
of
the
court
in
this
case,
conceived
that
it
was
intended
to
effect
a
pro
tanto
repeal
of
the
pre-existing
legislation.
and
there
is
a
question
of
whether
that
effect
can
be
severed
from
whatever
else
there
is
in
the
measure
that
this
court
might
believe
to
append
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
measure
is
limited
to
one
type
of
conduct
and
one.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
relates
only
to
the
decision
of
the
owner
of
residential
property
respecting
the
disposition
of
his
own
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
just
real
property,
real
residential
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
not
personal
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
below
as
i
analyzed
the
opinion
if
we
spelled
it
out
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
didn't
reach
the
question
of
severability
of
the
repealing
effects
from
the
balance
of
the
measure,
because
it
held
that
the
repealing
effect
was
--
was
the
unconstitutional
part
of
it.
so,
accordingly,
if
didn't
have
to
say
whether
it
was
severable
or
not.
it
held
it
was
invalid.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
--
would
say
mr.
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
but
i
--
they
were
talking
about
different
severability,
point
1,
which
i
might
add
was
never
argued
but
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
there
are
three
severability
points
that
could
be
involved
in
this
case.
one
was
the
severability
point
treated
by
the
court
below
which
was,
any
--
any
of
the
practice
provision
may
have
in
lifting
regulation
of
racial
discrimination
is
unconstitutional.
now,
it
may
be
that
it
would
be
valid
if,
for
example,
a
landlord
refused
to
rent
to
someone
because
they
had
too
many
children.
there
would
be
a
valid
application.
it
said
that
the
racial
and
the
non-racial
aspects
of
it
could
not
be
severed.
the
other
severability
problem
is
one
that
i've
just
mentioned,
the
question
of
whether
the
repealing
effect
can
be
severed
from
the
balance
of
the
measure.
and
the
third
problem
assuming
that
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
third,
the
measure
has
three
purposes
and
three
purposes
only.
one,
was
to
re-establish
a
long-standing
common-law
rule
up
until
1959
in
california
and
41
other
states,
i
understand.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
it
did
three
things.
it
re-established
the
common-law
rule
that
a
property
owner
had
the
freedom
to
--
in
the
disposition
of
his
property
to
choose
to
--
with
whom
he
would
deal,
in
any
respect
he
chose,
so
long
as
it
was
not
prohibited
by
some
valid
law.
that's
purpose
number
one.
purpose
number
two
was
to
effect
a
repeal
of
any
inconsistent
provisions
of
previous
legislative
activity.
three,
the
purpose
was
to
reserve
to
the
people
acting
as
the
legislative
body
to
enact
any
future
regulatory
legislation
which
would
affect
the
right
of
a
property
owner
to
dispose
of
his
property
in
such
manner
as
he
chose.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
effect
of
the
law
that
is
created
by
that
they
are
the
same.
yes.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
probably
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
--
the
snyder
property
is
described
in
the
record
as
a
six-and-a-half
unit
dwelling
and
i
believe
i
said
it
was
in
beverly
hills.
it's
in
the
--
los
angeles
near
beverly
hills.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
the
other
building
is
in
santa
ana
about
45
--
about
30
miles
from
los
angeles.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
in
orange
county
and
i
don't
believe
there's
any
data
in
the
record
as
to
the
description
of
that
property,
but
i
understand
it's
a
multiple
unit
dwelling
containing,
perhaps,
10
units.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
suppose
you
would
--
that
would
be
accurate
except
in
the
--
in
the
prendergast
case,
mr.
--
the
evidence
in
the
record
as
mr.
and
mrs.
snyder
purchased
this
property
as
an
investment
in
their
retirement
that
they
intend
to
move
into
one
of
the
apartments
and
they
have
been
highly
selective
in
choosing
the
people
that
lived
in
the
balance
of
the
apartments
because
they
expect
it
to
be
their
home
as
well
as
income
property.
there's
no
evidence
on
the
mulkey
case
as
to
(inaudible)
of
the
issue.
now,
the
rationale
of
the
california
supreme
court
invalidating
this
measure
was
that
california
became
responsible
for
the
racial
discrimination
of
these
petitioners
because
california
had
taken
what
it
called
affirmative
action
of
a
legislative
nature
designed
to
make
possible
discriminatory
conduct
which
had
previously
been
prohibited
by
statute.
the
implication,
of
course,
from
that
kind
of
language
is,
had
there
been
no
such
statute,
then
there
would
no
constitutional
invalidity
in
section
26.
indeed,
the
court
says,
by
way
of
dictum
in
the
mulkey
opinion
and
by
way
of
holding
in
a
companion
case
entitled
hill
versus
miller
that
the
state
had
no
--
affirmative
constitutional
duty
to
provide
a
remedy
against
private
racial
discrimination
it
held.
and
that,
in
california,
there
is
no
right
of
action
for
--
by
a
negro,
for
example,
against
the
property
owner
for
racial
discrimination
in
housing
accepting
only
as
it's
regulated
by
statute.
so,
as
we
said
before,
we
think
the
rationale
of
the
court
below
was
a
repeal
of
these
statutes.
this
reversible
of
policy,
as
they
put
it,
from
one
where
california
had
first
prohibited
racial
discrimination,
then,
they
adopted
section
26
which
lifted
this
prohibition
that
that
change
of
direction
made
california
responsible
for
racial
discrimination
that
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
of
course,
that's
been
urged,
mr.
justice
douglas,
but
i
think
the
--
the
zoning
function
is
substantially
different
from
independent
choices
of
independent
people
with
respect
to
their
properties.
the
zoning
function,
of
course,
and
i
think
the
most
significant
part
of
the
zoning
function
is
that
it
emanates
directly
from
the
government,
number
one.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
that's
also
because
the
reason
that
was
enforced
against
a
willing
buyer
and
willing
seller
who
did
not
wish
to
practice
racial
discrimination,
the
only
reason
that
was
effective
is
because
the
state
court
prohibit
trades
to
prohibit
them
from
consummating
the
transaction.
there
again,
you
have
coercion
emanating
from
the
state,
and
when
that
happens,
we
do
not
claim
that
there
is
no
clear
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
we
don't
want
to
extend
it
as
it
was,
but
the
california
supreme
court
ruled,
however.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
there's
a
willing
seller
and
a
willing
buyer
who
wanted
to
consummate
a
transaction
and
the
state
court
intervened
and
said,
"you
can't
do
it."
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
white
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
measure
says
private
discrimination
is
hereby
authorized.
what
it
says
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
what
it
says
is
that
freedom
of
choice
by
a
property
owner
shall
not
be
regulated
by
the
state.
that
is
--
that
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
you
may
act
arbitrarily
with
this
freedom
of
giving.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
--
so
this
--
this
proposition
says
--
now,
it
says
private
discriminations
are
authorized.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
i
think
it's
over
--
oh,
i
think
it
authorizes
free
speech,
certainly.
it's
an
oversimplification
to
say
that
--
that
this
authorizes
racial
discrimination.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
not
according
to
our
view.
that
it
operates
only
with
respect
to
the
independent
position
of
a
private
property
owner
with
respect
to
a
disposition
of
his
own
private
property?
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
he
could
not.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
in
using
the
--
the
measure
reads.
neither
the
state
nor
any
agency
thereof
shall
deny
the
right
of
any
person
to
sell
or
rent
any
part
or
all
of
his
real
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
to
such
person
or
persons
as
he
and
his
absolute
discretion
chooses.
so
we
construe
that
to
mean
that
it
relates
solely
to
the
decision
of
the
property
owner
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
his
property,
wouldn't
permit
concerted
activity
by
a
neighborhood
of
property
owners
because
in
that
event,
that
would
cover
more
than
any
right
to
dispose
of
his
properties.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
yes.
there
--
there
is
already
such
a
statute
in
california
from
this
point.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
yes.
it
was
adopted,
i
believe
in
1963
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
it's
unaffected
by
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
i
don't
--
i
don't
so
read
the
measure,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
believe
the
court
below
did
and
i
don't
believe
anybody
has
contended
that
it
did.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
--
that
may
be
a
reason
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
his
property,
but
there's
no
way
that
i
know
that
it
could
be
done
in
combination
or
concert
so
as
to
restrict
the
sale
or
disposition
of
an
aggregate
of
property
merely
because
all
of
the
property
owners
had
agreed
to
act
accordingly.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
it
occurred
--
there
was
a
concerted
activity
of
any
kind.
i'm
talking
about
the
individual
right
of
an
individual
property
with
respect
to
his
property.
and
i
think
if
concerted
action
were
established,
we
have
a
different
case
than
we
have
before
us
today.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
you
mean
the
owner
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
approach
justice
fortas,
but
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
--
the
measure
gives
a
property
owner
the
right
not
to
enter
into
a
contract
of
sale
of
his
own
property
for
whatever
reason.
it
does
not
give
him
a
right,
however,
to
reduce
or
perform
a
contract
that
he
has
entered
into.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
would
and
if
i
follow
you
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
now
we
--
i
don't
read
that
it
permits
that
kind
of
covenant,
mr.
justice
fortas,
particularly
in
view
of
the
effect
that
a
statute,
specifically
outlaws
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
certainly
would
prevent
a
court
from
enforcing
any
breach
of
that
covenant
and
not
withstanding,
the
federal
rule
because
that
would
be
state
interference
with
the
transferee's
right
to
dispose
of
his
property.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
oh,
yes.
as
i
was
saying,
the
basic
purpose
of
the
measure
aside
from
reserving
to
the
people,
the
right
to
change
the
rule
in
the
future.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
to
change
this
common-law
rule
in
the
future.
the
basic
purpose
of
this
measure
was
to
re-establish
in
california
this
long-standing
common-law
rule.
this
rule,
as
we
see
it,
relates
solely
to
the
conduct
of
private
persons
with
respect
to
private
property
in
their
dealings
with
other
private
individuals.
and
accordingly,
it's
not
within
the
frame
of
reference
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
are
assuming
and
the
court
below
so
held
as
we
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
recently
as
the
last
term.
this
court
has
held
in
effect
that
there
is
no
self-executing
right
of
action
under
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
favor
of
a
private
person
who
is
denied
access
to
private
property
for
a
reason
which
could
not
properly
be
relied
upon
by
the
state
under
the
fourteenth.
from
that
assumption,
the
question
becomes
whether
the
common-law
rule
becomes
offensive
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
when
a
state
first
modifies
the
common-law
rule
by
adopting
a
statute
and
thereafter,
re-establishes
the
common-law
rule
by
repealing
the
statute.
here
again,
it
seems
on
analysis,
there
is
no
violation
by
the
state
of
any
federal
right
of
the
person
discriminated
against.
while
this
common-law
was
rule
--
was
in
effect,
he
had
no
federal
rights.
while
the
statutory
is
in
effect,
he
had
only
a
state
right
under
that
statute
--
under
that
statute.
and
so
it
should
follow
that
after
the
statute
is
repealed,
that
it
still
has
no
federal
right
of
action.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
this
measure
is
specifically
excludes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
all
places
of
public
accommodation
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
--
and
places
providing
transient
lodging,
accommodations
by
a
hotel
and
a
motel
or
other
similar
public
places
that
excludes
public
accommodations,
that
excludes
property
owned
by
the
state.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
--
that
this
constitutional
question
would
be
substantially
the
same
with
respect
to
public
accommodations
and
business
rentals.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
public
accommodations
in
this
case
is
a
little
easier
to
decide
there
is
a
constitutional
question,
than
private
residential
property
--
with
property
which
never
had
normally
been
opened
to
the
public
on
a
--
on
a
transitory
basis
or
kind
of
the
like
public
accommodations.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct,
certainly.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
of
course,
i
think
in
the
absence
of
federal
activity
in
that
area
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
access,
to
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
private
--
public,
privately
owned
public
accommodation
under
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
it
relates
everywhere.
however,
though,
mr.
justice
douglas,
from
the
rental
of
a
room
in
your
own
home
where
your
family
lives
to
a
multiple
apartment
building
of
a
great
size
and
obviously,
a
business
entity,
but
as
we
shall
indicate,
we
think
the
constitution
doesn't
draw
the
line
as
to
where
those
conduct
is
proper
and
where
it
isn't
proper.
that
is
strictly
a
legislative
matter
either
by
congress
under
a
constitutional
grant
of
power
or
by
the
state
acting
under
its
police
power
to
decide
which
of
this
--
what
--
what
portion
of
this
conduct,
if
any,
should
be
prohibited
by
the
imposition
of
governmental
sanction.
now,
the
court
below,
in
holding
that
this
reversal
of
legislative
policy
was
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
creates
an
anomalous
result,
it
seems
to
us,
that
would
in
effect,
make
it
possible
for
any
local
legislature,
any
place
in
the
country.
to
create
a
federal
constitutional
right
by
adopting
a
regulatory
statute
which
should
have
no
constitutional
mandate
to
adopt,
and
thereafter,
repealing
it.
thus,
it's
--
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
a
species
of
federal
right
that
can
be
created
merely
because
a
particular
majority
of
a
temporary
legislature
adopts
a
regulatory
statute
and
then
repeals
it.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
well,
the
california
supreme
court,
speaking
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
as
i
read
their
decision
that
there
would
be
no
constitutional
difficulty
with
this
measure
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
there
was
a
statute
enacted.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
the
constitutional
right,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
constitutional
right
which
the
california
court
said,
this
respondent
said,
was
the
right
to
have
that
statute
prohibiting
the
conduct
of
petitioners
stay
in
effect,
notwithstanding
the
effort
of
the
people
to
repeal
it.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
not
to
have
it
repealed.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
it
has
the
same
effect,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
and
so
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
according
to
the
theory
of
the
court
below,
this
would
vary
from
place-to-place.
there'd
be
no
such
constitutional
right
in
illinois,
for
example,
or
in
texas
because
they
don't
have
any
regulation
on
the
subject.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
that
all
it
says.
and
it
doesn't
go
even
quite
that
far.
it
repeals
a
portion
of
the
unruh
and
rumford
act
to
wit,
the
portion
relating
to
the
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
we
do,
your
honor.
when
i
read
it
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
would
say
yes,
unless
that
has
the
effect
of
encouraging
people
to
discriminate
in
a
way
that's
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
don't
think
this
measure
does
that.
the
way
your
honor
quoted,
it
might.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.i
believe
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
should
(inaudible),
but
that
is
not
what
this
measure
does.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
the
state
--
the
state
authorizing
the
use
of
its
coercive
power
to
prohibit
a
citizen
of
this
country
from
acquiring
property,
solely
on
grounds
of
this
race.
that
would
be
the
constitutional
defect
in
that
measure.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
in
these
two
cases
we
are
all
of
a
measure,
would
cover
a
sale,
as
well.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
these
two
cases
here
are
rentals,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
month-to-month
rentals
of
these
apartments.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
yes,
it
is
that.
but
this
provision,
mr.
justice
black,
is
nothing
more
than
a
statement
in
the
california
constitution
of
what
the
common-law
rule
is
in
41
states
of
the
union
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
no.
that
is
correct.
it
gives
the
property
owner
the
freedom
to
choose
and
i
should
suggest
the
responsibility
to
act
wisely
in
the
exercise
of
his
freedom.
it's
the
same
as
any
other
free
conduct
that
we
recognize
in
this
country
that
merely
by
giving
people
freedom
from
governmental
regulation
doesn't
constitute
authorization
for
abuse
of
that
freedom.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
in
my
time.
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
federal
plan
in
the
first
place,
the
problem
here
is
one
about
that
state
control,
at
least,
in
the
absence
of
congressional
legislation.
and
secondly,
that
in
this
area,
where
we're
not
talking
about
protecting
a
constitutional
right,
we're
talking
about
protecting
a
right
of
one
individual
against
another
individual.
but
in
that
broad
area
of
conduct,
the
legislature
is
the
proper
institution
of
government
to
decide
where
the
line
should
be
drawn.
the
legislature
--
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
o.
pruitt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
i'm
saying
this
would
not
apply
where
we
have
a
constitutional
right
as
being
infringed
by
the
state.
it
would
not
apply,
for
example,
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
a
property
owner
who
had
a
constitutional
right
to
exclude
a
trespasser,
for
example,
for
any
reason.
but
in
the
broad
middle
area
of
conflicting
rights
and
responsibilities
as
between
individuals,
where
nobody
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
somebody
else
recognize
that
right,
but
only
a
right
to
have
it
if
the
law
says
that
certain
conduct
shall
be
permitted.
by
law,
i
say,
means
the
judgment
of
a
legislature,
not
the
judgment
of
a
court.
