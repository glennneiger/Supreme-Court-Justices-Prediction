mr.
a.
l.
wirin
chief
justice,
may
it
please
your
honors.
i
address
myself
first
to
answer
an
inquiry
put
to
mr.
pruitt
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
justice
fortas
as
to
whether
or
not
the
provision
which
we
are
challenging
that
we
challenged
below,
section
26
of
the
california
constitution,
includes
or
encompasses
persons
who
determine
to
discriminate
in
the
sale
or
rental
of
housing
because
of
race
based
upon
agreement
with
others,
particularly
agreements
in
the
nature
of
restrictive
covenants.
my
answer
to
the
question
of
your
honors
is
different
from
that
given
to
you
by
mr.
pruitt.
the
text
of
section
26
appears
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief
for
the
petitioners
as
do
the
valid
arguments
which
were
submitted
to
the
voters
in
california.
the
first
sheet
or
page
in
the
appendix,
right
after
the
blue
sheet
from
the
brief
for
the
petitioners
contains
the
text
of
section
26.
your
honors
will
find
that
the
brief
for
the
petitioners
and
the
brief
for
respondents
may
carry
the
similar
colors
but
they're
quite
different
in
thrust
and
in
import
so
far
as
the
arguments
presented
are
concerned.
this
is
called
brief
for
petitioners
and
it
has
an
appendix
following
a
little
blue
sheet
and
the
critical
or
significant
provisions
of
this
--
of
this
entire
section
is
in
the
first
paragraph
and
i
merely
refer
to
the
last
sentence
in
the
first
paragraph
and
to
the
phrase,
“in
his
absolute
discretion.”
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
reading
of
that
phrase
stated
as
broadly
as
i
think
the
english
language
permits
in
his
absolute
discretion,
would
certainly
include
an
individual
who
in
his
own
absolute
discretion
undertakes
voluntarily
to
arrive
in
the
--
to
arrive
an
agreement
with
others.
all
of
whom
voluntarily
agree
to
discriminate
in
housing
because
of
race
and
thus
the
restrictive
covenant.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
reading
of
a
provision
on
its
face,
moreover
your
honors,
we
challenged
below
and
the
court
below
was
of
the
view
that
section
26
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
what
the
provision
says
on
its
face
is
--
it
is
the
first
consideration.
additionally
your
honors,
this
section,
section
26
in
the
fourth
paragraph
which
is
the
last
paragraph
on
the
same
sheet,
undertakes
with
precision
to
carve
out
certain
exemptions.
these
exemptions
are
with
respect
to
the
obtaining
of
property
by
eminent
domain
and
with
respect
to
accommodations
for
transients.
so,
when
the
writers
of
this
provision
intended
to
make
exemptions,
they
were
able
to
and
succeeded
in
setting
forth
those
exemptions
with
precision,
no
exemption
so
far
as
the
unlimited,
unrestrained,
uncontrolled
by
the
courts,
authority
of
the
individual
to
exercise
his
absolute
discretion
no
matter
the
circumstances
or
the
considerations
which
entered
into
his
--
his
own
discretion.
no
such
limitation
appears
on
the
face
of
the
--
of
the
section.
moreover
your
honors,
i've
stated
your
honors
that
the
valid
arguments
are
contained
in
this
--
in
this
appendix.
your
honors
will
find
nothing
in
the
valid
--
valid
arguments
which
suggest
any
such
exemption
for
persons
who
determine
to
discriminate
in
their
absolute
discretion
based
upon
such
agreements.
and
finally
as
to
this
narrow
point,
narrow
or
broad,
in
addition
to
the
formal
arguments
which
were
submitted
to
the
voters
on
--
to
the
voters,
valid
arguments
and
distributed
by
the
secretary
of
state
which
are
attached
as
part
of
the
appendix
to
the
brief
for
the
petitioners.
there
is
an
extended
brief
by
one
of
amici,
namely
the
united
auto
workers
union
and
i
--
i
state
simply
quickly
for
your
honors'
guidance,
if
it
is,
that
attached
as
appendices
to
that
brief,
it
is
the
gray
brief,
motion
for
--
by
the
united
auto
workers.
there
are
arguments
made
to
the
voters
perhaps
informally,
but
nonetheless
circulated
by
the
california
real
estate
association
and
its
subordinate
organizations,
distributed
and
circulated
by
that
organization
to
the
voters
stating
the
purpose
and
the
meaning
of
section
26.
and
nowhere
in
any
of
the
arguments
presented
to
the
voters,
even
informally
is
there
any
suggestion
that
the
limitation
suggested
by
mr.
pruitt
maybe
--
maybe
read
into
this
section.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
they're
prepared
by
persons
who
are
prominent
on
each
--
on
each
side
of
the
controversy.
the
decision
as
to
who's
prominent
is
made
by
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh
no.
we
do
not
have,
your
honor,
i
mean,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
have
no
censorship.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
i'm
saying
is
that
some
evidence
that
this
court
may
consider
as
to
the
legislative
history.
and
after
what
the
proponents
thought
that
the
measurement.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
as
to
what
the
voters
were
told.
i
should
say
to
you
although
it's
utterly
irrelevant
that
the
--
those
who
oppose
the
proposition
included
bishop
donahue,
dr.
cole,
the
president
of
the
council
of
churches
and
a
man
named
stanley
mosk
who
happened
to
be
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
and
on
the
other
side
with
the
real
estate
association
and
its
(inaudible)
now,
i
--
i
deal
with
another
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
your
honor,
yes
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
if
he
changed
his
mind
or
he'd
have
a
right
to
change
his
mind,
but
i
do
say
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
in
the
example
which
your
honor
gave,
i
--
i
would
agree,
but
i
suggest
a
converse
example
that
is
assuming
he
enters
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
i
agree
with
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
if
he
changed
his
mind
i
think
--
i
think
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
it
does
though.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now
in
this
way.
if
he
changes
his
mind
and
decides
not
to
remain
a
member
of
this
--
not
abide
by
the
agreement
which
he
made,
he
has
a
right
to
do
that
under
this.
but
if
he
decides
to
adhere
to
the
provisions
of
the
agreement,
it
seems
to
me
because
section
26
broadsidedly
prohibits
any
agency
of
the
state
of
california
which
includes
a
judge
thereon
from
inquiring
into
the
nature
of
or
the
basis
for
the
exercise
of
absolute
discretion
by
the
individual.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
such
a
circumstance,
a
court
under
this
--
this
provision
is
foreclosed
from
inquiring
into
the
existence
of
an
agreement
or
the
nature
of
the
agreement
or
whether
or
not
the
individual
discriminates
because
of
the
agreement.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
yes,
and
of
course
my
--
my
complaint
is
that
it
is
foreclosed
in
the
contrary.
now
in
additionally
your
honors,
mr.
pruitt
stated
to
you
to
the
court
yesterday
that
it
was
his
view
that
this
provision
applies
to
what
he
called
individual
action,
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
individual
and
does
not
apply
to
action
in
--
by
individuals
acting
in
concert,
kind
of
a
corollary
to
the
problem
of
persons
agreeing
in
connection
to
--
to
have
restrictive
covenants.
now
here
again
your
honors,
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
section
26
since
on
the
face
of
it,
it
provides
that
an
individual
may
exercise
his
absolute
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
discriminate
because
of
race.
there
is
nothing
in
that
section
which
bars
an
individual
from
cooperating
with
others,
in
concert
or
otherwise,
in
effectuating
racial
discrimination.
and
there
is
not
--
there
is
no
such
exception
in
the
--
in
the
section
26
and
no
such
exception
is
suggested
in
the
valid
arguments
and
no
such
exception
is
suggested
by
the
california
real
estate
association
to
sponsor
for
this
proposal
in
the
arguments
made
which
were
distributed
to
the
voters
which
as
i
have
indicated
are
next
to
the
brief
of
the
auto
workers
union.
now
moreover,
if
i
may
say
so
to
your
honors,
if
it
is
true,
if
mr.
pruitt
is
correct
in
his
statement
to
this
court,
that
this
provision,
section
26,
does
not
affect
persons
engaging
in
discrimination
or
--
as
a
result
of
acting
in
concert,
then
your
honors
are
confronted
with
the
following
situation.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
your
honor,
this
court
reviews
judgments.
that
judgment
merely
ordered
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
superior
court
of
orange
county.
that
judgment
barred
the
plaintiff
from
having
a
trial
on
his
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
courts
of
california
by
section
26
were
barred
from
--
from
permitting
any
relief
in
connection
with
alleged
racial
discrimination.
now
your
honors
will
find
in
the
record
at
page
4,
the
complaint
which
the
trial
court
ruled,
stated
no
cause
of
action
and
accorded
no
right
to
power,
the
court
to
grant
relief
and
particularly
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint.
and
your
honors
will
find
that
in
paragraph
8
at
page
4
of
the
reitman,
of
the
multi-complaint
against
reitman.
he
alleges
not
only
acts
of
discrimination
by
the
owners
and
by
the
--
by
the
reitman.
he
alleges
that
the
discrimination
which
the
defendants
participated
in
is
also
practiced
by
other
real
estate
brokers
and
home
and
landowners
and
so
forth
and
owners
--
in
orange
county
and
throughout
california.
now
it
may
be
this
complaint
does
--
certainly
this
complaint
doesn't
use
the
word
concert,
but
it
certainly
undertakes
to
allege
the
actions
of
others
as
constituting
a
practice.
that
means
that
a
practice
often
is
engaged
in
--
when
persons
act
in
concert.
so,
therefore,
if
your
honors
accept
the
view
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners
that
section
26
does
not
apply
to
action
in
concert
and
since
the
cases
here
merely
as
a
result
of
a
sustaining
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
it
were
by
the
trial
court,
minimally,
it
is
my
argument,
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
or
dismiss
the
petition
as
--
as
a
--
i
guess
the
phrase
is
improvidently
granted
or
whatever
it
is.
but
now
i
turn
to
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
one
further
matter
that
i
want
to
mention
quickly
in
that
connection.
mr.
pruitt
has
gone
off
the
record.i
make
no
criticism
on
it.
that
the
apartment
building
involved
in
the
reitman
case
had
10
units.
in
fact
i
have
checked
on
it
and
he
is
correct,
but
moreover,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
reitmans
owned
--
well,
he
didn't
say
this
exactly
--
virtually
says
it,
have
owned
other
apartment
buildings
and
i
am
informed
and
i
say
this
for
what
it
is
worth
in
the
court
that
the
reitmans,
the
petitioners
here
and
defendants
below
are
a
large
institution
owning
and
managing
numerous
apartment
houses
in
orange
county
and
constitute
one
of
the
largest
apartment
house
owners
and
operators
in
orange
county.
now
i
say
this
to
you
your
honors
simply
to
say
that
if
your
honors
were
to
follow
my
argument
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
--
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
the
effect
would
be
merely
to
permit
the
plaintiffs
to
proceed
with
proof
of
their
complaint
including
paragraph
8
in
the
complaint
and
maybe
they
can
prove
what
i
have
just
said
to
your
honors,
i
believe
are
the
facts.
now
i
turn
however
to
what
i
think
is
the
critical
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
or
not
section
26,
both
on
its
face
and
in
terms
of
its
legislative
history
is
no
more
than
a
repeal
of
earlier
provisions
of
state
law,
whether
or
not
in
adopting
section
26,
california
played
the
role
of
neutrality,
i
think
the
phrase
this
court
has
used,
mr
justice
white
has
used
is
the
role
of
strict
neutrality.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
certainly.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
am
prepared
to
say
i
would
not
because
in
my
view
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
sir?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right
then.
i'm
going
to
answer
your
honor's
question
now
in
--
in
--
with
some
--
with
some
detail
if
i
may.
indeed,
i
was
going
to
say
now
and
i
will
state
that
i
want
to
discuss
the
--
the
phrase
which
you
used
mr.
justice
black,
namely
whether
or
not
a
state
is
barred
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
remaining
(inaudible),
from
doing
nothing,
from
hitting
his
hands
off
of
and
playing
no
role
in
the
matter
of
racial
discrimination.
now
my
answer
to
your
honor
is
that
a
state
is
not
barred
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
playing
that
role
assuming
the
point,
if
that
is
--
if
that
is
strictly
the
role
which
it
placed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
in
shelley
versus
kraemer,
there
was
affirmative
action.
there
was
affirmative
action
by
the
courts
which
was
considered
to
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
of
course
i
don't
--
i
don't
argue
with
that
case
at
all,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
--
i'm
not
discussing
whether
or
not
private
action
or
whether
they
may
be
relieved
from
private
action
or
against
private
action
of
the
courts.
i'm
merely
stating
that
if
a
state
does
not
put
its
thumb
on
the
scales,
that
it
in
actual
realistic
fact
it
plays
the
role
of
strict
neutrality.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
but
if,
namely,
the
state
of
california
through
its
courts
undertook
to
enforce
that
private
contract,
and
to
that
extent,
there
was
state
involvement
and
i
--
so
i'm
trying
not
to
reach
that
question
until
--
until
a
little
bit
later
because
i
want
to
--
if
i
can
and
i
can
agree
with
mr.
justice
black
and
that
others
--
members
of
the
court
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
know
you
are.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
know
you
are.
but
i'm
trying
to
convince
mr.
justice
black
and
i
--
this
will
be
the
first
time
that
i
think
i'm
having
difficulty
in
doing
so,
but
there's
always
a
first
time
your
honor.
and
so
i'm
saying
and
i'm
willing
to
rest
with
the
statement
that
if
a
state
is
strictly
neutral
in
fact
and
in
reality
that
then
discrimination
by
a
private
person,
no
matter
his
motive,
no
matter
how
venal
his
motive,
no
matter
how
racist
or
bigoted
he
is,
it
is
no
concern
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
let
me
say
that
arguendo
or
--
or
otherwise,
but
it
is
our
position
that
california
has
done
more
than
that
in
this
case.
now
i'm
trying
to
begin
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question.
now
quickly
it
is
arguable
and
we
might
be
willing
to
concede.
but
prior
to
1959,
a
person
in
california
could
refuse
to
sell
property,
including
residential
property
which
he
operated
as
a
business
and
this
was
no
violation
of
the
--
of
anything
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
concededly
also,
the
state
of
california
entered
upon
the
scene
in
connection
with
housing
in
1959
where
it
is
up
to
the
law
which
prohibited
discrimination
in
business
establishments
which
included
the
business
of
rental
of
premises
and
in
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
this
was
something
that
the
state
of
california
could
do
and
it
did
do,
not
under
compulsion
of
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
not
under
compulsion
of
fourteenth
amendment,
the
legislature
of
california
determined
to
do
something
more
than
did
the
1959
act,
known
as
the
unruh
act
and
specifically
protect
persons
from
other
persons
so
far
as
discrimination
in
housing,
in
residential
housing
is
concerned
and
it
did
that
in
the
other
way.
all
right,
this
is
19
--
1963.
now
california
through
its
legislature,
either
the
legislature
convening
in
sacramento
or
the
so-called
super
legislature,
the
people
of
california
which
under
the
california
constitution
have
a
right
to
exercise
the
power,
the
equivalent
of
a
legislature,
so-called
a
super
legislature.
california
had
a
choice
your
honors.
there
was
unruh,
there
was
rumford
and
the
california
legislature
might
have
repealed
those
provisions,
if
it
had,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
in
california,
the
people
didn't
have
to
wait
on
the
legislature
because
there
is
a
provision
for
the
initiative
and
referendum
and
so
dissatisfied
with
the
action
of
the
legislature,
the
people
of
california
had
some
choices.
the
people
of
california
by
referendum
could
have
repealed
unruh
and
rumford.
had
the
people
of
california
merely
repealed
unruh
and
rumford,
we
wouldn't
be
here
and
this
isn't
that
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
--
the
california
supreme
court
and
this
appears
more
particularly
on
the
record
at
27,
which
is
the
opinion
of
the
court,
construed
section
26
as
an
affirmative
act
by
the
high
legislature
of
california
which
encouraged
--
that's
record
27,
which
encourage
racial
discrimination.
that
phrase
appears
about
halfway
down
of
the
first
new
paragraph.
here,
the
state
has
affirmatively
acted.
shall
i
direct
your
honors
to
it?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right.
i'm
looking
at
page
27.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
looking
at
the
first
new
paragraph
and
then
--
one,
two,
three,
the
third,
the
third,
the
third
sentence
maybe.
here,
the
state
--
here,
the
state.
your
honors
i'm
looking
at
the
record
which
is
a
--
which
is
a
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
don't
know
whether
justice
white
have
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it's
a
manila
brown
up
on
page
27
and
i'm
referring
to
the
sentence,
here,
the
state
has
affirmatively
acted
to
change
its
existing
laws
from
a
situation
wherein
the
discrimination
practice
was
legally
restricted
to
one
where
it
is
encouraged.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
--
i
would
certainly
so
assume.
i
certainly
so
urge.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
can
be
your
honor.
that
court
does
not.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
i
have
an
explanation
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
which
i
made
to
that
court
which
the
court
didn't
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
if
it
doesn't
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
your
honors
after
i
state
to
the
court
what
is
in
our
briefs
with
respect
to
this
matter.
the
court
will
see
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
a
sufficient
showing
before
it,
so
that
it's
use
of
the
phrase
that
this
provision
encourages
discrimination
is
--
is
first
supported
and
then
supportable.
moreover
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
it
is
your
honors.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
it's
i'm
saying.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
so
and
this
court
has
--
now
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
white.
i'm
agreeing
that
this
court
--
when
do
the
constitutional
question
always
looks
at
the
matter
closely,
considers
the
position
of
the
findings
of
a
state
court
with
a
great
freedom.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
does
it?
i
was
hoping
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
but
then
(inaudible)
to
you
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
thought
we
have
the
best
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
mr.
justice
brennan
i
--
i
want
to
say
--
i
want
to
argue
to
the
court
that
our
--
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
proposal
which
--
which
is
called
to
your
attention
in
our
briefs
as
well
as
the
face
of
this
proposal
demonstrates
that
it
is
affirmative
action
and
not
merely
a
repeal.
and
i
also
want
to
state
your
honors
having
--
i
indicated
to
you
your
honors
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
used
--
was
of
the
view
that
this
provision
encouraged
discrimination.
in
the
snyder
case,
the
record
is
to
the
effect.
mr.
and
mrs.
prendergast
were
caucasian
and
negro.
the
record
is
to
the
effect,
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
by
them.
there
is
no
denial
by
the
defendant
that
the
effort
to
oust
them
from
the
premises
which
they
had
theretofore
lawfully
--
lawfully
possessed
came
after
the
adoption
of
proposition
14
of
section
26.
so
there's
something
in
the
record
from
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
could
have
inferred
that
the
effect
of
the
adoption
of
section
26
was
to
encourage
even
in
--
even
in
that
very
case
the
taking
of
the
measures
which
were
taken
by
the
parties
in
that
case,
but
more
than
that
and
additionally,
i
was
saying
to
your
honors
that
had
california
and
the
voters
of
california
and
the
california
real
estate
association
wanted
merely
a
repeal.
they
could
have
achieved
their
repeal
by
the
voters
of
california
under
the
provision
in
the
california
constitution
which
is
article
4
which
provides
for
the
initiative
and
referendum
by
a
referendum.
this
is
how
a
repeal
is
achieved,
an
initiative
in
california
is
more
than
a
referendum.
it
is
more
than
a
repeal.
it
is
an
effort
affirmatively
to
enact
some
--
some
new
provision
of
law.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
could
be
repealed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
could
be
repealed.
it
could
be
repealed
to
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
are
--
there
are
two
differences
in
what
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
yes
but
because
it
is
on
the
constitution
--
because
it
is
on
the
--
now,
california
could
have
put
the
same
provision
mr.
justice
black
into
a
statute.
if
it
were
in
a
statute,
it
would
have
the
effect
of
law,
but
it
could
--
it
would
not
require
a
vote
of
the
people
in
order
to
repeal
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
not
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
if
the
people
put
it
into
an
initiative,
only
the
people
can
change
it.
if
they
put
it
into
a
referendum,
either
the
legislature
or
the
people
can
change
it.
but
let
me
conclude
this
point
with
this
further
observation.
had
this
been
an
initiative
which
was
written
into
a
statute
of
california,
they
still
would
be
required
another
initiative
in
order
to
get
rid
of
it.
why
then
your
honors
and
i
ask
this
in
parallel
to
the
questions,
was
this
provision
written
into
the
constitution
of
california?
why
was
it
put
into
article
1
of
the
constitution
of
california
which
is
the
declaration
of
rights
of
california?
because
it
was
intended
by
those
who
wanted
it
to
elevate
the
right
of
discrimination
into
a
constitutional
right.
now
when
a
matter
becomes
one
of
constitutional
right
as
for
example
when
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
is
provided
for
in
a
constitution,
it
is
intended
and
expected
that
it
will
encourage
persons
to
exercise
freedom
of
speech.and
when
a
provision
is
enshrined
in
a
state
constitution,
it
is
intended
and
in
my
opinion
has
the
inevitably
effect
of
encouraging
persons
to
engage
in
the
discrimination
which
is
affirmatively
sanctioned.
now
one
final
word
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
my
response
to
your
honor
is
this,
certainly
that
provision
in
the
first
paragraph
of
this
--
of
this
--
of
section
26
is
written
in
the
broadest
of
terms
in
the
most
comprehensive
of
language
and
bars
the
state
or
any
of
its
agencies
and
of
course
part
of
an
agency
of
a
state
from
ever
under
any
circumstances
interfering
with
the
exercise
of
absolute
discretion
brought
by
an
individual.
and
to
that
extent,
i
have
to
--
as
additional
string
to
our
bow,
the
point
which
had
just
been
discussed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
would
you
your
honor
tell
me
again
what
that
page
that
was?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
but
mr.
justice
of
course
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
your
honor
--
my
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
this
statement
is
100%
correct
and
i
have
said
nothing.
i
think
i
said
nothing,
to
contradict
it.
here's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
let
me
--
(inaudible)
if
unruh
and
rumford
were
dealt
with
by
a
referendum
of
the
people,
that
referendum
would
be
merely
a
repeal,
but
if
--
but
if
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
if
it's
an
issue
--
whether
or
not
the
initiative
amends
the
statutes
of
california
or
changes
the
constitutions
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
one
--
and
one
of
my
arguments
is
precisely
because
the
right
to
discriminate
it
is
enshrined
to
the
constitutional
right
in
the
constitution
of
california
when
it
maybe
have
been
because
it
could
have
been
made
a
statute
and
still
be
the
legislature
couldn't
touch
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
i
just
state
to
your
honor
why
i
think
there
may
be
a
difference.
if
the
claim
of
a
claimant
is
that
private
discriminatory
action
is
encouraged
by
state
action.
and
hence
that
state
action
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
arguable,
if
the
state
action
is
in
the
constitution,
that
the
power
of
encouragement
of
the
practice
which
is
enshrined
in
the
constitution,
the
power
of
encouragement
is
the
greater
if
it
is
in
the
constitution
rather
than
the
statute.
now
that
is
all
i'm
arguing,
and
i
--
i
need
to
get
back
my
argument.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
chief
justice,
may
it
please
your
honors.
i
address
myself
first
to
answer
an
inquiry
put
to
mr.
pruitt
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
justice
fortas
as
to
whether
or
not
the
provision
which
we
are
challenging
that
we
challenged
below,
section
26
of
the
california
constitution,
includes
or
encompasses
persons
who
determine
to
discriminate
in
the
sale
or
rental
of
housing
because
of
race
based
upon
agreement
with
others,
particularly
agreements
in
the
nature
of
restrictive
covenants.
my
answer
to
the
question
of
your
honors
is
different
from
that
given
to
you
by
mr.
pruitt.
the
text
of
section
26
appears
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief
for
the
petitioners
as
do
the
valid
arguments
which
were
submitted
to
the
voters
in
california.
the
first
sheet
or
page
in
the
appendix,
right
after
the
blue
sheet
from
the
brief
for
the
petitioners
contains
the
text
of
section
26.
your
honors
will
find
that
the
brief
for
the
petitioners
and
the
brief
for
respondents
may
carry
the
similar
colors
but
they're
quite
different
in
thrust
and
in
import
so
far
as
the
arguments
presented
are
concerned.
this
is
called
brief
for
petitioners
and
it
has
an
appendix
following
a
little
blue
sheet
and
the
critical
or
significant
provisions
of
this
--
of
this
entire
section
is
in
the
first
paragraph
and
i
merely
refer
to
the
last
sentence
in
the
first
paragraph
and
to
the
phrase,
“in
his
absolute
discretion.”
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
reading
of
that
phrase
stated
as
broadly
as
i
think
the
english
language
permits
in
his
absolute
discretion,
would
certainly
include
an
individual
who
in
his
own
absolute
discretion
undertakes
voluntarily
to
arrive
in
the
--
to
arrive
an
agreement
with
others.
all
of
whom
voluntarily
agree
to
discriminate
in
housing
because
of
race
and
thus
the
restrictive
covenant.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
reading
of
a
provision
on
its
face,
moreover
your
honors,
we
challenged
below
and
the
court
below
was
of
the
view
that
section
26
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
what
the
provision
says
on
its
face
is
--
it
is
the
first
consideration.
additionally
your
honors,
this
section,
section
26
in
the
fourth
paragraph
which
is
the
last
paragraph
on
the
same
sheet,
undertakes
with
precision
to
carve
out
certain
exemptions.
these
exemptions
are
with
respect
to
the
obtaining
of
property
by
eminent
domain
and
with
respect
to
accommodations
for
transients.
so,
when
the
writers
of
this
provision
intended
to
make
exemptions,
they
were
able
to
and
succeeded
in
setting
forth
those
exemptions
with
precision,
no
exemption
so
far
as
the
unlimited,
unrestrained,
uncontrolled
by
the
courts,
authority
of
the
individual
to
exercise
his
absolute
discretion
no
matter
the
circumstances
or
the
considerations
which
entered
into
his
--
his
own
discretion.
no
such
limitation
appears
on
the
face
of
the
--
of
the
section.
moreover
your
honors,
i've
stated
your
honors
that
the
valid
arguments
are
contained
in
this
--
in
this
appendix.
your
honors
will
find
nothing
in
the
valid
--
valid
arguments
which
suggest
any
such
exemption
for
persons
who
determine
to
discriminate
in
their
absolute
discretion
based
upon
such
agreements.
and
finally
as
to
this
narrow
point,
narrow
or
broad,
in
addition
to
the
formal
arguments
which
were
submitted
to
the
voters
on
--
to
the
voters,
valid
arguments
and
distributed
by
the
secretary
of
state
which
are
attached
as
part
of
the
appendix
to
the
brief
for
the
petitioners.
there
is
an
extended
brief
by
one
of
amici,
namely
the
united
auto
workers
union
and
i
--
i
state
simply
quickly
for
your
honors'
guidance,
if
it
is,
that
attached
as
appendices
to
that
brief,
it
is
the
gray
brief,
motion
for
--
by
the
united
auto
workers.
there
are
arguments
made
to
the
voters
perhaps
informally,
but
nonetheless
circulated
by
the
california
real
estate
association
and
its
subordinate
organizations,
distributed
and
circulated
by
that
organization
to
the
voters
stating
the
purpose
and
the
meaning
of
section
26.
and
nowhere
in
any
of
the
arguments
presented
to
the
voters,
even
informally
is
there
any
suggestion
that
the
limitation
suggested
by
mr.
pruitt
maybe
--
maybe
read
into
this
section.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
they're
prepared
by
persons
who
are
prominent
on
each
--
on
each
side
of
the
controversy.
the
decision
as
to
who's
prominent
is
made
by
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh
no.
we
do
not
have,
your
honor,
i
mean,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
have
no
censorship.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
i'm
saying
is
that
some
evidence
that
this
court
may
consider
as
to
the
legislative
history.
and
after
what
the
proponents
thought
that
the
measurement.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
as
to
what
the
voters
were
told.
i
should
say
to
you
although
it's
utterly
irrelevant
that
the
--
those
who
oppose
the
proposition
included
bishop
donahue,
dr.
cole,
the
president
of
the
council
of
churches
and
a
man
named
stanley
mosk
who
happened
to
be
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
and
on
the
other
side
with
the
real
estate
association
and
its
(inaudible)
now,
i
--
i
deal
with
another
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
your
honor,
yes
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
if
he
changed
his
mind
or
he'd
have
a
right
to
change
his
mind,
but
i
do
say
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
in
the
example
which
your
honor
gave,
i
--
i
would
agree,
but
i
suggest
a
converse
example
that
is
assuming
he
enters
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
i
agree
with
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
if
he
changed
his
mind
i
think
--
i
think
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
it
does
though.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now
in
this
way.
if
he
changes
his
mind
and
decides
not
to
remain
a
member
of
this
--
not
abide
by
the
agreement
which
he
made,
he
has
a
right
to
do
that
under
this.
but
if
he
decides
to
adhere
to
the
provisions
of
the
agreement,
it
seems
to
me
because
section
26
broadsidedly
prohibits
any
agency
of
the
state
of
california
which
includes
a
judge
thereon
from
inquiring
into
the
nature
of
or
the
basis
for
the
exercise
of
absolute
discretion
by
the
individual.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
such
a
circumstance,
a
court
under
this
--
this
provision
is
foreclosed
from
inquiring
into
the
existence
of
an
agreement
or
the
nature
of
the
agreement
or
whether
or
not
the
individual
discriminates
because
of
the
agreement.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
yes,
and
of
course
my
--
my
complaint
is
that
it
is
foreclosed
in
the
contrary.
now
in
additionally
your
honors,
mr.
pruitt
stated
to
you
to
the
court
yesterday
that
it
was
his
view
that
this
provision
applies
to
what
he
called
individual
action,
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
individual
and
does
not
apply
to
action
in
--
by
individuals
acting
in
concert,
kind
of
a
corollary
to
the
problem
of
persons
agreeing
in
connection
to
--
to
have
restrictive
covenants.
now
here
again
your
honors,
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
section
26
since
on
the
face
of
it,
it
provides
that
an
individual
may
exercise
his
absolute
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
discriminate
because
of
race.
there
is
nothing
in
that
section
which
bars
an
individual
from
cooperating
with
others,
in
concert
or
otherwise,
in
effectuating
racial
discrimination.
and
there
is
not
--
there
is
no
such
exception
in
the
--
in
the
section
26
and
no
such
exception
is
suggested
in
the
valid
arguments
and
no
such
exception
is
suggested
by
the
california
real
estate
association
to
sponsor
for
this
proposal
in
the
arguments
made
which
were
distributed
to
the
voters
which
as
i
have
indicated
are
next
to
the
brief
of
the
auto
workers
union.
now
moreover,
if
i
may
say
so
to
your
honors,
if
it
is
true,
if
mr.
pruitt
is
correct
in
his
statement
to
this
court,
that
this
provision,
section
26,
does
not
affect
persons
engaging
in
discrimination
or
--
as
a
result
of
acting
in
concert,
then
your
honors
are
confronted
with
the
following
situation.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
your
honor,
this
court
reviews
judgments.
that
judgment
merely
ordered
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
superior
court
of
orange
county.
that
judgment
barred
the
plaintiff
from
having
a
trial
on
his
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
courts
of
california
by
section
26
were
barred
from
--
from
permitting
any
relief
in
connection
with
alleged
racial
discrimination.
now
your
honors
will
find
in
the
record
at
page
4,
the
complaint
which
the
trial
court
ruled,
stated
no
cause
of
action
and
accorded
no
right
to
power,
the
court
to
grant
relief
and
particularly
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint.
and
your
honors
will
find
that
in
paragraph
8
at
page
4
of
the
reitman,
of
the
multi-complaint
against
reitman.
he
alleges
not
only
acts
of
discrimination
by
the
owners
and
by
the
--
by
the
reitman.
he
alleges
that
the
discrimination
which
the
defendants
participated
in
is
also
practiced
by
other
real
estate
brokers
and
home
and
landowners
and
so
forth
and
owners
--
in
orange
county
and
throughout
california.
now
it
may
be
this
complaint
does
--
certainly
this
complaint
doesn't
use
the
word
concert,
but
it
certainly
undertakes
to
allege
the
actions
of
others
as
constituting
a
practice.
that
means
that
a
practice
often
is
engaged
in
--
when
persons
act
in
concert.
so,
therefore,
if
your
honors
accept
the
view
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners
that
section
26
does
not
apply
to
action
in
concert
and
since
the
cases
here
merely
as
a
result
of
a
sustaining
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
it
were
by
the
trial
court,
minimally,
it
is
my
argument,
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
or
dismiss
the
petition
as
--
as
a
--
i
guess
the
phrase
is
improvidently
granted
or
whatever
it
is.
but
now
i
turn
to
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
one
further
matter
that
i
want
to
mention
quickly
in
that
connection.
mr.
pruitt
has
gone
off
the
record.i
make
no
criticism
on
it.
that
the
apartment
building
involved
in
the
reitman
case
had
10
units.
in
fact
i
have
checked
on
it
and
he
is
correct,
but
moreover,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
reitmans
owned
--
well,
he
didn't
say
this
exactly
--
virtually
says
it,
have
owned
other
apartment
buildings
and
i
am
informed
and
i
say
this
for
what
it
is
worth
in
the
court
that
the
reitmans,
the
petitioners
here
and
defendants
below
are
a
large
institution
owning
and
managing
numerous
apartment
houses
in
orange
county
and
constitute
one
of
the
largest
apartment
house
owners
and
operators
in
orange
county.
now
i
say
this
to
you
your
honors
simply
to
say
that
if
your
honors
were
to
follow
my
argument
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
--
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
the
effect
would
be
merely
to
permit
the
plaintiffs
to
proceed
with
proof
of
their
complaint
including
paragraph
8
in
the
complaint
and
maybe
they
can
prove
what
i
have
just
said
to
your
honors,
i
believe
are
the
facts.
now
i
turn
however
to
what
i
think
is
the
critical
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
or
not
section
26,
both
on
its
face
and
in
terms
of
its
legislative
history
is
no
more
than
a
repeal
of
earlier
provisions
of
state
law,
whether
or
not
in
adopting
section
26,
california
played
the
role
of
neutrality,
i
think
the
phrase
this
court
has
used,
mr
justice
white
has
used
is
the
role
of
strict
neutrality.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
certainly.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
am
prepared
to
say
i
would
not
because
in
my
view
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
sir?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right
then.
i'm
going
to
answer
your
honor's
question
now
in
--
in
--
with
some
--
with
some
detail
if
i
may.
indeed,
i
was
going
to
say
now
and
i
will
state
that
i
want
to
discuss
the
--
the
phrase
which
you
used
mr.
justice
black,
namely
whether
or
not
a
state
is
barred
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
remaining
(inaudible),
from
doing
nothing,
from
hitting
his
hands
off
of
and
playing
no
role
in
the
matter
of
racial
discrimination.
now
my
answer
to
your
honor
is
that
a
state
is
not
barred
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
playing
that
role
assuming
the
point,
if
that
is
--
if
that
is
strictly
the
role
which
it
placed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
in
shelley
versus
kraemer,
there
was
affirmative
action.
there
was
affirmative
action
by
the
courts
which
was
considered
to
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
of
course
i
don't
--
i
don't
argue
with
that
case
at
all,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
--
i'm
not
discussing
whether
or
not
private
action
or
whether
they
may
be
relieved
from
private
action
or
against
private
action
of
the
courts.
i'm
merely
stating
that
if
a
state
does
not
put
its
thumb
on
the
scales,
that
it
in
actual
realistic
fact
it
plays
the
role
of
strict
neutrality.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
but
if,
namely,
the
state
of
california
through
its
courts
undertook
to
enforce
that
private
contract,
and
to
that
extent,
there
was
state
involvement
and
i
--
so
i'm
trying
not
to
reach
that
question
until
--
until
a
little
bit
later
because
i
want
to
--
if
i
can
and
i
can
agree
with
mr.
justice
black
and
that
others
--
members
of
the
court
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
know
you
are.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
know
you
are.
but
i'm
trying
to
convince
mr.
justice
black
and
i
--
this
will
be
the
first
time
that
i
think
i'm
having
difficulty
in
doing
so,
but
there's
always
a
first
time
your
honor.
and
so
i'm
saying
and
i'm
willing
to
rest
with
the
statement
that
if
a
state
is
strictly
neutral
in
fact
and
in
reality
that
then
discrimination
by
a
private
person,
no
matter
his
motive,
no
matter
how
venal
his
motive,
no
matter
how
racist
or
bigoted
he
is,
it
is
no
concern
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
let
me
say
that
arguendo
or
--
or
otherwise,
but
it
is
our
position
that
california
has
done
more
than
that
in
this
case.
now
i'm
trying
to
begin
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question.
now
quickly
it
is
arguable
and
we
might
be
willing
to
concede.
but
prior
to
1959,
a
person
in
california
could
refuse
to
sell
property,
including
residential
property
which
he
operated
as
a
business
and
this
was
no
violation
of
the
--
of
anything
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
concededly
also,
the
state
of
california
entered
upon
the
scene
in
connection
with
housing
in
1959
where
it
is
up
to
the
law
which
prohibited
discrimination
in
business
establishments
which
included
the
business
of
rental
of
premises
and
in
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
this
was
something
that
the
state
of
california
could
do
and
it
did
do,
not
under
compulsion
of
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
not
under
compulsion
of
fourteenth
amendment,
the
legislature
of
california
determined
to
do
something
more
than
did
the
1959
act,
known
as
the
unruh
act
and
specifically
protect
persons
from
other
persons
so
far
as
discrimination
in
housing,
in
residential
housing
is
concerned
and
it
did
that
in
the
other
way.
all
right,
this
is
19
--
1963.
now
california
through
its
legislature,
either
the
legislature
convening
in
sacramento
or
the
so-called
super
legislature,
the
people
of
california
which
under
the
california
constitution
have
a
right
to
exercise
the
power,
the
equivalent
of
a
legislature,
so-called
a
super
legislature.
california
had
a
choice
your
honors.
there
was
unruh,
there
was
rumford
and
the
california
legislature
might
have
repealed
those
provisions,
if
it
had,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
in
california,
the
people
didn't
have
to
wait
on
the
legislature
because
there
is
a
provision
for
the
initiative
and
referendum
and
so
dissatisfied
with
the
action
of
the
legislature,
the
people
of
california
had
some
choices.
the
people
of
california
by
referendum
could
have
repealed
unruh
and
rumford.
had
the
people
of
california
merely
repealed
unruh
and
rumford,
we
wouldn't
be
here
and
this
isn't
that
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
--
the
california
supreme
court
and
this
appears
more
particularly
on
the
record
at
27,
which
is
the
opinion
of
the
court,
construed
section
26
as
an
affirmative
act
by
the
high
legislature
of
california
which
encouraged
--
that's
record
27,
which
encourage
racial
discrimination.
that
phrase
appears
about
halfway
down
of
the
first
new
paragraph.
here,
the
state
has
affirmatively
acted.
shall
i
direct
your
honors
to
it?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right.
i'm
looking
at
page
27.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
looking
at
the
first
new
paragraph
and
then
--
one,
two,
three,
the
third,
the
third,
the
third
sentence
maybe.
here,
the
state
--
here,
the
state.
your
honors
i'm
looking
at
the
record
which
is
a
--
which
is
a
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
don't
know
whether
justice
white
have
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it's
a
manila
brown
up
on
page
27
and
i'm
referring
to
the
sentence,
here,
the
state
has
affirmatively
acted
to
change
its
existing
laws
from
a
situation
wherein
the
discrimination
practice
was
legally
restricted
to
one
where
it
is
encouraged.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
--
i
would
certainly
so
assume.
i
certainly
so
urge.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
can
be
your
honor.
that
court
does
not.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
i
have
an
explanation
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
which
i
made
to
that
court
which
the
court
didn't
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
if
it
doesn't
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
your
honors
after
i
state
to
the
court
what
is
in
our
briefs
with
respect
to
this
matter.
the
court
will
see
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
a
sufficient
showing
before
it,
so
that
it's
use
of
the
phrase
that
this
provision
encourages
discrimination
is
--
is
first
supported
and
then
supportable.
moreover
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
it
is
your
honors.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
it's
i'm
saying.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
so
and
this
court
has
--
now
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
white.
i'm
agreeing
that
this
court
--
when
do
the
constitutional
question
always
looks
at
the
matter
closely,
considers
the
position
of
the
findings
of
a
state
court
with
a
great
freedom.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
does
it?
i
was
hoping
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
but
then
(inaudible)
to
you
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
thought
we
have
the
best
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
mr.
justice
brennan
i
--
i
want
to
say
--
i
want
to
argue
to
the
court
that
our
--
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
proposal
which
--
which
is
called
to
your
attention
in
our
briefs
as
well
as
the
face
of
this
proposal
demonstrates
that
it
is
affirmative
action
and
not
merely
a
repeal.
and
i
also
want
to
state
your
honors
having
--
i
indicated
to
you
your
honors
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
used
--
was
of
the
view
that
this
provision
encouraged
discrimination.
in
the
snyder
case,
the
record
is
to
the
effect.
mr.
and
mrs.
prendergast
were
caucasian
and
negro.
the
record
is
to
the
effect,
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
by
them.
there
is
no
denial
by
the
defendant
that
the
effort
to
oust
them
from
the
premises
which
they
had
theretofore
lawfully
--
lawfully
possessed
came
after
the
adoption
of
proposition
14
of
section
26.
so
there's
something
in
the
record
from
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
could
have
inferred
that
the
effect
of
the
adoption
of
section
26
was
to
encourage
even
in
--
even
in
that
very
case
the
taking
of
the
measures
which
were
taken
by
the
parties
in
that
case,
but
more
than
that
and
additionally,
i
was
saying
to
your
honors
that
had
california
and
the
voters
of
california
and
the
california
real
estate
association
wanted
merely
a
repeal.
they
could
have
achieved
their
repeal
by
the
voters
of
california
under
the
provision
in
the
california
constitution
which
is
article
4
which
provides
for
the
initiative
and
referendum
by
a
referendum.
this
is
how
a
repeal
is
achieved,
an
initiative
in
california
is
more
than
a
referendum.
it
is
more
than
a
repeal.
it
is
an
effort
affirmatively
to
enact
some
--
some
new
provision
of
law.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
could
be
repealed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
could
be
repealed.
it
could
be
repealed
to
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
are
--
there
are
two
differences
in
what
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
yes
but
because
it
is
on
the
constitution
--
because
it
is
on
the
--
now,
california
could
have
put
the
same
provision
mr.
justice
black
into
a
statute.
if
it
were
in
a
statute,
it
would
have
the
effect
of
law,
but
it
could
--
it
would
not
require
a
vote
of
the
people
in
order
to
repeal
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
not
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
if
the
people
put
it
into
an
initiative,
only
the
people
can
change
it.
if
they
put
it
into
a
referendum,
either
the
legislature
or
the
people
can
change
it.
but
let
me
conclude
this
point
with
this
further
observation.
had
this
been
an
initiative
which
was
written
into
a
statute
of
california,
they
still
would
be
required
another
initiative
in
order
to
get
rid
of
it.
why
then
your
honors
and
i
ask
this
in
parallel
to
the
questions,
was
this
provision
written
into
the
constitution
of
california?
why
was
it
put
into
article
1
of
the
constitution
of
california
which
is
the
declaration
of
rights
of
california?
because
it
was
intended
by
those
who
wanted
it
to
elevate
the
right
of
discrimination
into
a
constitutional
right.
now
when
a
matter
becomes
one
of
constitutional
right
as
for
example
when
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
is
provided
for
in
a
constitution,
it
is
intended
and
expected
that
it
will
encourage
persons
to
exercise
freedom
of
speech.and
when
a
provision
is
enshrined
in
a
state
constitution,
it
is
intended
and
in
my
opinion
has
the
inevitably
effect
of
encouraging
persons
to
engage
in
the
discrimination
which
is
affirmatively
sanctioned.
now
one
final
word
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
my
response
to
your
honor
is
this,
certainly
that
provision
in
the
first
paragraph
of
this
--
of
this
--
of
section
26
is
written
in
the
broadest
of
terms
in
the
most
comprehensive
of
language
and
bars
the
state
or
any
of
its
agencies
and
of
course
part
of
an
agency
of
a
state
from
ever
under
any
circumstances
interfering
with
the
exercise
of
absolute
discretion
brought
by
an
individual.
and
to
that
extent,
i
have
to
--
as
additional
string
to
our
bow,
the
point
which
had
just
been
discussed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
would
you
your
honor
tell
me
again
what
that
page
that
was?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
but
mr.
justice
of
course
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
your
honor
--
my
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
this
statement
is
100%
correct
and
i
have
said
nothing.
i
think
i
said
nothing,
to
contradict
it.
here's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
let
me
--
(inaudible)
if
unruh
and
rumford
were
dealt
with
by
a
referendum
of
the
people,
that
referendum
would
be
merely
a
repeal,
but
if
--
but
if
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
if
it's
an
issue
--
whether
or
not
the
initiative
amends
the
statutes
of
california
or
changes
the
constitutions
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
one
--
and
one
of
my
arguments
is
precisely
because
the
right
to
discriminate
it
is
enshrined
to
the
constitutional
right
in
the
constitution
of
california
when
it
maybe
have
been
because
it
could
have
been
made
a
statute
and
still
be
the
legislature
couldn't
touch
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
i
just
state
to
your
honor
why
i
think
there
may
be
a
difference.
if
the
claim
of
a
claimant
is
that
private
discriminatory
action
is
encouraged
by
state
action.
and
hence
that
state
action
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
arguable,
if
the
state
action
is
in
the
constitution,
that
the
power
of
encouragement
of
the
practice
which
is
enshrined
in
the
constitution,
the
power
of
encouragement
is
the
greater
if
it
is
in
the
constitution
rather
than
the
statute.
now
that
is
all
i'm
arguing,
and
i
--
i
need
to
get
back
my
argument.
