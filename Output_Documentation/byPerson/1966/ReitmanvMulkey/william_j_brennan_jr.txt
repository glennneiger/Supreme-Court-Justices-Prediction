justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
court
explain
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
mr.
wirin,
but
certainly
it
can
either
side
can
expect
us.
i
would
suppose,
independently
to
construe
26.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
take
--
you
take
the
view
that
it
goes
beyond
just
to
repeal
rumford
and
unruh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pruitt
takes
the
position
it
doesn't
go
beyond
and
each
of
you
argues
that
the
--
that
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
supports
your
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
it
doesn't,
what
are
we
suppose
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
concede
that
if
this
is
nothing
but
a
repealer
then
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
there
would
no
constitutional
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
important
to
know
whether
26
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anything
beyond
that
and
we
can't
tell
from
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
--
you
know,
we've
had
this
trouble
with
your
court
before
in
the
last
couple
of
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
have
but
we've
had
--
only
two
terms
ago
we
have
to
send
a
case
back
and
say,
“we
don't
know
what
you
mean.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you
tell
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
been
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that's
been
removed
by
congressional
power.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
constitutional
theory
of
taft
is
--
is
something
that
i
don't
your
brief
has
addressed
itself
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pruitt,
is
this
an
argument
that
this
--
26
can
be
read
as
nothing
more
than
a
mere
repealer
of
the
provisions
of
rumford
and
unruh?
is
that
your
basic
position,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
understand
your
--
everyone
who
has
argued
on
the
other
side
instead
of,
that's
all
it
means,
it
wouldn't
even
be
here.
they've
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
--
i
still
come
back
to
what
i
asked
then.
you
--
you
certainly
don't
agree
and
let
the
supreme
court
of
california
interpret
the
section
26
to
do,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
other
side
doesn't
agree
with
you.
you
--
you're
not
in
agreement
as
to
what
the
--
on
the
interpretations
that
the
california
supreme
court
gave
to
26.
you
say
it's
only
a
mere
repealer.
and
they
say
if
that's
all
it
is,
they
wouldn't
be
here.
they
say
it's
much
more
than
that.
you
say
it's
not
any
more
than
that,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
what
are
we
suppose
to
do
in
that
--
in
that
circumstance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
california
supreme
court
didn't
really
tell
us,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pruitt,
isn't
it
consistent
with
what
--
would
it
be
consistent
with
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
--
to
say
that
whether
or
not
this
is
a
mere
repealer
that
proposition
14
encourages
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
cited
cases.
they
didn't
focus
on
whether
or
not
it
is
mere
repealer
or
it
isn't
--
or
they
didn't
--
that
they
didn't
really
put
it
in
those
words,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
said
whatever
it
is,
we
think
it
encourages
discrimination.
that's
about
as
far
as
they
went.was
it
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
many
of
the
cited
case?
justice
william

do
you
have
the
initiative
in
california
or
legislative
acts?
