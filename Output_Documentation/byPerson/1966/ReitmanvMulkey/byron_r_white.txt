justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
i
--
before
you
leave
this
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there
is
a
restrictive
agreement
between
property
owner
and
his
neighbor
that
he
won't
sell
to
negroes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
he
wants
to
sell
his
house,
he
decides
he
doesn't
want
to
sell
to
a
negro?
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
this
--
or
do
you
suggest
that
the
proposition
14
or
section
26
purports
to
give
the
courts
authority
to
enforce
that
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
furthermore
section
26
would
seem
to
me
that
at
least
you
can
make
an
argument
that
section
26
itself
would
bar
the
courts,
would
bar
the
courts
from
enforcing
the
remedy,
again
enforcing
the
contract
against
him
because
now
it's
not
in
his
unfettered
will.
i
mean
to
enforce
it
would
interfere
with
his
right
to
sell
as
he
saw
fit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
--
let's
finish
this
one
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
doesn't
purport
to
run
--
run
upstream
against
shelley
against
kraemer?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
courts
foreclosed
from
either
--
and
foresee
it
or
--
or
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
explain
how
it's
encouraged
--
how
this
action
taken
in
passing
26
encourage
discrimination
over
and
above
what
ordinary
repeal
would
have
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
can't
--
we
can't
tell
which
it
is
what
we
are
supposed
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wirin,
why
isn't
--
why
--
why
isn't
--
maybe
the
construction
of
26
isn't
open
here,
you
put
it
that
way,
but
why
isn't
the
impact
of
it,
the
constitutional
fact
that's
opened
for
review
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
california
courts
that
--
don't
really
explain
how
and
in
what
respect
this
encourages
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event
proposition
14
ends
up
like
creating
a
constitutional
right
to
discriminate?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
yes,
but
let's
just
say
that
before
rumford
and
unruh,
was
there
a
constitutional
right
to
discriminate
in
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
not
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
unruh
and
--
unruh
and
rumford
did
away
with
the
right
to
discriminate.
but
now,
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
discriminate
in
the
state
of
california
in
the
sense
that
no
legislature
--
no
legislative
act
or
ordinance
is
valid
in
that
state,
but
isn't
a
constitutional
right,
it's
nothing,
is
it?
people
have
the
constitutional
right
to
discriminate
much
have
the
(inaudible)
the
right
to
free
to
speech.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
