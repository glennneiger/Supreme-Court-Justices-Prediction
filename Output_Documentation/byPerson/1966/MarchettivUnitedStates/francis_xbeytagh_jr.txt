mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
points
made
by
mr.
zeldes
that
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
first
is
that
his
position
doesn't
impinge
upon
the
congressional
power
to
tax
at
all.
i
think
that's
fallacious.
he
suggests
several
things.
he
says,
one,
congress
can
still
tax
but
what
it
can't
do
is
require
the
disclosure
of
information
that
might
be
used
against
a
particular
person
charged
with
the
payment
of
the
tax.
and
he
says
that,
“well,
congress
might
enact
an
immunity
statute.”
what
seems
to
me
that
you
--
we
get
to
that
only
if
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
problem
and
you
would
have
to
say
that
congress
at
least
can't
tax
the
way
it
has
taxed.
he
says
also
that,
“well,
you
can
pay
the
tax
anonymously.”
our
position
is
that
a
tax
that
has
to
be
paid
in
such
a
strange
and
unique
manner
in
which
the
taxpayer
doesn't
identify
himself,
give
his
address
just
isn't
administrable
as
a
practical
matter.
both
mr.
zeldes
and
professor
wright
say
over
and
over
again
that
there's
no
problem
here
with
sullivan.
we
agree
that
sullivan
is
distinguishable,
it's
different,
the
court
pointed
out
in
albertson
a
rationale
in
which
sullivan
differed
there.
but
it's
not
quite
all
that
easy
in
our
view.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
talk
about
the
fifth
amendment
as
protecting
a
person
for
many
link
or
lead
that
could
be
used
against
him
and
it's
very
difficult
to
conclude
that
a
taxpayer
filing
an
income
tax
return
in
which
he
refuses
to
disclose
the
source
on
the
grounds
of
the
fifth
amendment
hasn't
provided
some
link
or
some
lead.
now
the
court
has
been
willing
to
accept
sullivan
rationale.
it
did
so
in
albertson.
we
think
that
that
distinction
is
of
sound
--
but
that
raises
all
the
problems
that
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
white
have
been
talking
about.
and
it
raises
in
our
mind
the
question
of
whether
the
position
put
forward
here
in
effect,
the
tax
--
congress
can't
tax
in
the
way
it
has
is
of
sound.
one
of
the
things
that
was
thrown
out
here
was
the
point
that
the
wageing
tax
only
operates
on
essentially
illegal
activity
is
except
in
nevada.
well,
the
senate
committee
report
explains
why
bingo
games
and
parimutuel
betting
and
whatever
are
excluded.
it
seems
to
me
it's
pretty
sensible.
they
say
that
the
committee
has
excluded
the
above
types
of
gambling
not
because
of
any
belief
but
they
are
not
suitable
subjects
for
taxation.
however,
the
method
of
taxation
provided
while
particularly
appropriate
to
bookmaking
and
the
policy
operations
does
not
appear
readily
adoptable
to
these
other
forms
of
gambling.
and
then
with
respect
to
parimutuel
wagering
they
say
it
doesn't
apply
there
because
such
wagering
is
presently
subject
to
substantial
state
and
in
some
instances
local
taxation.
and
to
superimpose
a
federal
tax
upon
these
transactions
would
only
serve
to
maintain
the
existing
advantage
which
bookmakers
enjoy
over
parimutuel
betting
by
reason
of
their
immunity
on
parimutuel
taxes.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
question
really
is
whether
congress
can
put
an
excise
tax
on
gamblers.
we
have
taken
the
position
throughout
that
congress
can
do
so.
we
think
that
kahriger
and
lewis
provide
a
sensible
accommodation.
and
the
word
accommodation
as
it
seems
to
me
is
the
one
to
be
shy
away
from.
it's
the
term
the
court
used
in
murphy,
said
that
the
rule
that
they
adopted
there
was
one
that
would
accommodate
state
and
the
federal
interest.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
been
the
consistent
approach
of
at
least
the
majority
of
this
court.
the
fifth
amendment
is
consistently
accommodated
with
other
powers
that
exist
in
the
constitution.
it
does
not
exist
in
the
abstract,
it
exist
in
the
same
constitution
that
has
the
power
to
tax
and
power
to
do
other
thing.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
you
accommodated
a
way,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
you
make
it
unenforceable.
if
you
read
it
against
the
background
of
the
other
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
way
to
look
at
it.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
one
of
our
suggestions
is
that
the
court
adopts
the
rule
that
would
prevent
that.
a
restriction
on
the
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
repeal
the
fifth
amendment
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
makes
it
unenforceable.
it
protects
the
individual
against
the
harm
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect
him
against.
that
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
he
can
be
a
witness
against
himself,
your
honor
if
what
he
is
compelled
to
disclose
can't
be
used
against
him.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
you
adopt
the
rule
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
if
you
adopt
the
rule
similar
to
the
rule
adopted
in
the
murphy
case
by
this
court
which
is
a
prohibition
on
the
use
of
this
information
that
is
compelled
of
the
individual
in
any
subsequent
prosecution.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
could
have
been
a
thing
for
congress
to
do
in
the
murphy
situation.
but
the
court
didn't
do
that,
your
honor.
the
court
stated
that
it
was
adopting
an
exclusionary
rule
which
would
protect
the
individual
against
any
incriminatory
use.
and
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
exactly
understand
that
the
thrust
of
the
question
that
all
that
the
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
it's
not
an
exemption
from
prosecution,
that's
not
the
rule
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
not
from
prosecution,
your
honor,
from
use
of
the
information
which
is
compelled
or
its
fruits
as
a
link
or
lead
or
whatever.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
that
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
of
whether
and
how
he
can
later
be
prosecuted
for
the
substantive
offense.
he
may
or
he
may
not
be
able
to
depending
upon
how
this
information
is
used.
it
can't
be
introduced
under
this
rationale
against
him
in
a
subsequent
prosecution.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes,
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
essential
aspect
of
murphy
and
that
is
part
of
the
alternative
approach
that
we
suggest
here.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
other
approach
that
we
suggest
is
essentially
kahriger
and
lewis
as
far
as
we
can
determine
what
they
stand
for
and
what
they
speak
for.
kahriger
and
lewis
have
been
regarded
by
many
as
being
grounded
on
the
consideration
that
the
registration
requirement
involved
in
both
those
cases
was
simply
prospective
in
operation.
well,
it
is
perspective
in
a
sense
but
we
don't
rely
on
that
because
we
don't
think
that
that's
principle
basis
on
which
those
decisions
were
grounded.
particularly
in
the
lewis
case,
the
court
developed
the
approached
which
said
that
there
is
simply
no
compulsion
here
operative
in
the
fifth
amendment
sense.
and
there
isn't
any
because
a
person
considering
entering
into
gambling
has
a
free
choice,
clear
choice
as
to
whether
he
can
or
not.
when
he
does
make
the
decision
to,
he
should
be
regarded
as
having
assumed
the
tax
conditions
that
federal
government
attaches
to
that.
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
a
sensible
rationale
but
we
realized
that
the
court
wouldn't
have
taken
these
cases
to
reconsider
kahriger
and
lewis
in
light
of
albertson.
had
a
thought
that
rationale
was
completely
sound
and
subject
to
some
scrutiny.
and
we
suggest
therefore
that
if
in
light
of
albertson
and
if
in
light
of
the
courts
concern
with
this
problem,
it
should
feel
that
rationale
is
no
longer
a
viable
one
then
that
the
alternative
we
suggest
should
be
adopted.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
we
have
to
take
a
look
at
albertson
because
that's
really
what
we
are
reconsidering
these
cases
in
light
of.
albertson
is
--
the
court
is
of
course
aware
was
a
communist
party
registration
case.
there
the
registration
requirement
operated
on
people
who
had
already
been
found
by
the
subversive
activities
control
board
to
be
subject
to
registration.
there
the
registration
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes,
that
was
one
argument
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
found
that
the
--
they
agrees
with
the
government's
information
or
lack
thereof
was
not
a
pertinent
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
fortiori
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
in
that
respect,
perhaps.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
--
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
--
underlying
albertson
are
some
very
broad
and
some
difficult
implications
and
they
don't
just
involve
wagering,
they
involve
taxation
generally.
they
involve
regulation
by
government
generally.
the
whole
concept
of
self-reporting
and
disclosure
permeates
our
tax
and
our
regulatory
system.
and
if
we
are
going
to
get
to
the
position
where
the
fifth
amendment
excuses
anyone
might
feel
that
he
should
not
comply
because
it
might
incriminate
him.
then
serious
implications
are
raised
with
this
whole
program.
now,
there
are
regulatory
statutes
in
which
there
is
very
little
illegal
activity
and
in
which
it
would
be
difficult
for
one
to
conclude
that
how
could
he
possibly
involve
--
be
involved
in
a
crime.
without
speaking
to
the
--
that
question
directly,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
other
regulatory
statutes
in
which
some
people
do
engage
in
activity
lawfully
and
some
people
don't.
now,
albertson
spoke
about
the
problem
of
the
individual
determining
for
himself
without
determination
by
a
tribunal
that
he
was
authorized
to
claim
the
privilege.
that's
the
same
problem
that's
presented
with
respect
to
the
application
of
albertson,
its
other
context.
nobody
would
know
whether
these
people
really
had
a
privilege
claim
or
not.
the
problem
of
course
is
one
that
it
seems
to
us
can
be
resolved
at
least
in
the
alternative
via
restriction
on
the
incriminatory
use.
the
alternative
it
seems
to
me
in
operating
tax
and
regulatory
programs
is
just
an
undesirable
one.
and
the
alternative
is
that
nobody
would
be
compelled
or
required
to
disclose
anything.
the
government
would
have
to
go
out
and
get
this
information
from
people
by
agents
and
investigations.
i
think
that's
crazy.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
developed
a
system
here
in
which
people
do
have
to
come
forward
and
say
things
to
the
government
and
they
have
to
do
that
because
that's
the
way
to
run
the
--
these
programs.
now
whatever
implications
albertson
has
in
that
regard
it
seems
to
us
are
serious
and
important.
i
wold
like
to
speak
for
a
moment
on
the
problem
of
the
sullivan
case.
now
we
agree
that
the
income
tax
situation
is
different.
mr.
zeldes
pointed
out
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
we
inserted
in
our
brief
a
statement
that
no
specific
identification
or
source
was
required
with
respect
to
the
income
tax.
and
that's
right
but
as
i
pointed
out,
it
seems
to
us
quite
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
individual
income
tax
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
and
the
point
that
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
problem
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
in
practice
what
these
people
do,
they
say
--
they
tell
us
that
they're
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
my
understanding
of
what
is
done
with
the
present
practice
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
a
--
the
sullivan
rationale
as
we
understand
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
what
is
done
when
the
employer
is
one
that
--
generally
i
think
these
people
are
probably
self-employed
but
where
the
employer
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
if
disclosure
of
your
employer
would
be
incriminating
then
you
would
not
disclose
your
employer.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
you're
still
required
to
disclose
the
income
and
to
pay
tax
on
it.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
say
other
miscellaneous
or
i
think
most
of
the
people
that
are
in
that
situation
make
up
some
name
or
have
some
name
that
they
used
income.
that
isn't
incriminating
to
show
us
that
--
as
the
source.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
a
false
statement.
you
know,
if
they're
little
more
sophisticated.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no
i
don't
think
--
i
wasn't
implying
that
if
it's
a
wrong
name,
it
--
its
company
a,
if
company
a
is
really
a
company,
but
they
don't
disclose
what
business
company
a
is
in.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
didn't
get
to
that,
it's
been
read
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it's
been
read
subsequently
as
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that
precise
--
that's
right.
the
precise
question
in
sullivan
is
whether
you
could
fail
to
file
a
return
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
some
of
the
language
in
sullivan
is
i
pointed
out
is
pertinent
here.
sullivan
says
that
the
non-taxpayer
there
cannot
simply
draw
a
circle
around
his
activities
and
prevent
the
government
from
inquiring
at
all
into
the
--
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
the
tax
problem
by
not
filing
return
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
that
albertson
recognize
this
distinction.
in
albertson
the
court
said
to
one
of
the
claim
or
privilege
not
asserted
at
the
time
the
return
is
due
would
make
the
taxpayer,
rather
than
a
tribunal
(inaudible)
as
to
claim.
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
few
moments
to
the
alternative
rationale
that
we
discussed.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
matter
of
conferring
immunity
from
use
is
appropriate
for
congressional
and
judicial
determination.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
thing
could
be
said
about
the
problem
that
existed
in
murphy.
the
court
in
murphy
could
simply
have
said
that
there
is
a
problem
here
now
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
both
to
the
states
and
in
to
federal
government
and
that
these
individuals
can't
be
compelled
to
answer.
if
on
the
other
hand
congress
chooses
to
do
so,
it
can
enact
a
statute
which
would
protect
them
from
any
incriminating
use
of
this
information
in
a
federal
prosecution.
now
the
court
could
have
done
that
but
it
didn't
do
that.
the
court
adopted
what's
essentially
an
exclusionary
rule
that
the
court
has
clearly
the
power
to
do.
it's
done
it
in
other
circumstances
and
we
suggest
that
this
would
be
an
appropriate
thing
to
do
here.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that
what
must
be
disclosed?
the
fact
of
registration?
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
one
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
with
respect
to
6107
despite
the
implication
of
mr.
zeldes'
argument,
6107
was
not
enacted
along
with
the
wagering
tax,
it
antedates
it
considerably.
we
have
taken
the
position
in
our
brief
that
the
--
should
the
congress
--
should
the
court
feel
that
--
to
use
restriction
approach
should
be
taken
here,
the
internal
revenue
service
will
seek
amendment
of
6107
to
have
it
no
longer
related
to
the
wagering
tax
provision.
6107
relates
to
all
special
taxes
not
just
the
wagering
tax.
it
seems
to
us
that
under
the
fifth
amendment
so
long
as
the
information
that
the
government
obtains
from
anyone
is
confined
to
use
in
the
aid
of
collecting
taxes
that
no
self-incrimination
problem
arises.
the
guy
is
required
to
devolve
certain
information
to
the
government.
he
does
so.
it's
used
to
enforce
and
collect
taxes,
no
self-incrimination.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
he
cannot
be
harmed
with
respect
to
these
disclosures
unless
and
until
the
information
is
used
to
assist
and
convict
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
not
just
possible
that
he
might
if
a
murphy
type
of
rule
is
adopted
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us
that
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
murphy
that
the
problem
of
focusing
either
on
the
time
of
attempted
compulsion
or
the
time
of
attempted
use
of
incriminatory
information
is
no
longer
a
pertinent
one.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
murphy
took
that
into
account.
now,
murphy
said,
we
hold
the
constitutional
rule
provision
but
a
state
witness
may
not
be
compelled
to
give
testimony
which
may
be
incriminating
under
federal
law
unless
the
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
by
federal
officials
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
use
restriction
approach
as
to
reports
and
returns
that
are
affirmatively
filed.
it
seems
to
me
it
maybe
a
different
question
as
to
whether
the
same
sort
of
approach
is
either
required
or
desirable.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
shapiro
deals
with
and
it
may
are
things
that
are
ordinarily
and
regularly
maintained
by
people
that
have
because
of
their
relationship
to
the
governmental
program,
certain
aspects
that
--
to
make
them
suitable
to
governmental
or
public
scrutiny.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
does
talk
about
that.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
those
are
exactly
all
the
categories
there
are.
it
seems
to
me
the
question
may
be
whether
--
not
whether
the
particular
law
required
a
certain
record
or
whether
the
kind
of
record
required
was
such
that
it
ordinarily
be
kept.
and
there
were
the
cases
that
fall
into
the
side
of
that
kind
of
(inaudible).
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
said
that
my
answer
to
that
question
is
essentially
the
same
as
mr.
zeldes'
gave
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
problem
is
posed,
its
difficult
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
shapiro
would
apply
to
those
records
so
long
as
we
can
assume
that
the
taxpayer
ordinarily
would
keep
certain
kind
of
records
anyhow
of
that
type
in
conjunction
with
this
--
his
activity
whatever
they
may
be.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
difficulty
that
you
posed
is
this,
that
if
that's
so,
does
sullivan
make
sense?
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
right
because
it
seems
to
me
then
you'd
have
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
rationale
of
sullivan
that
the
taxpayer
doesn't
incriminate
himself
because
he
can
fail
to
disclose
the
source
if
that
source
is
illegal
may
be
something
of
a
track
cause
he
does
that
and
then
shapiro
is
thrown
out.
and
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
is.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
i
have
said
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
that's
--
that
is
a
different
situation
in
shapiro
because
you're
requiring
people
then
to
come
forward
and
do
things
they
otherwise
would
not
do.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
but
shapiro
relate
it
to
records
that
presumably
were
already
in
existence
and
maintained.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
requiring
somebody
to
come
forward
and
to
fill
these
things
out
than
maintain
records.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
any
prosecution
for
gambling
could
be
sustained.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
depends
upon
how
the
particular
prosecuting
authorities
come
about
their
information
if
they
go
into
the
guy's
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
gambling
prosecutions
would
continue
as
before.
that
doesn't
say
too
much
of
course,
but
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
you
think
that
after
adoption
of
this
kind
of
rule,
gamblers
will
suddenly
rush
in
and
they'll
all
register
and
they
all
pay
the
tax
which
would
be
very
nice
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
with
federal
government.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
those
difficulties
are
going
to
be
that
great
because
our
understanding
is
that
the
information
that
it
is
obtained
as
a
result
as
compliance
is
not
a
terribly
important
factor
as
to
whether
a
state
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes.
but
the
question
would
be
whether
but
before
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
be
whether
but
before
that
the
state
would
have
known
about
the
gun
and
the
problem
generally
isn't
whether
they
know
about
them
or
not,
whether
they
have
the
--
were
with
all
the
prosecutors.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
oh,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances
if
the
name
of
the
business
itself
would
be
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
there
isn't
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
there
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that's
our
reading
of
sullivan.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
and
sullivan
as
interpreted
in
albertson.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
of
any
here.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
in
what
context
would
that
question
be
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
difficult
to
answer
that
question
without
knowing
the
context
in
which
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
because
if
it
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
because
form
11-c
is
a
form
that's
required
to
be
completed
and
filed
in
conjunction
with
the
payment
of
a
tax.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it'd
be
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
but
in
your
hypothetical
it
seems
to
me
all
that
congress
would
doing
would
be
attempting
to
set
up
a
system
whereby
they
obtained
incriminating
information
about
people.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
we
don't
say
that
it
aviates
the
collision.
we
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
collision.
we
suggest
the
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
--
several
ways
of
resolving
that.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
waive
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
that
was
the
court's
wording.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
in
this
day
and
age
there
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
just
for
few
moments,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
dispositions
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
kahriger
and
lewis
rationale,
the
non-compulsion
voluntary
choice
rationale
is
accepted
that
the
affirmance
is
as
dictated
here.
and
we
recognized
however
that
more
difficult
problems
presented
if
the
court
should
adopt
the
murphy
type
exclusionary
rule
approach.
we
recognized
that
in
murphy
the
court
reversed
the
civil
content
convictions
there
on
the
ground
that
the
individual
should
be
given
another
opportunity
to
testify.
we
think
however
that
our
circumstances
here
are
different.
and
that
they
do
not
necessarily
warrant
a
remand
or
reversal
if
a
use
restriction
approach
was
adopted.
the
petitioners
in
these
cases
knew
about
kahriger
and
lewis.
that
they
knew
that
the
statute
had
been
upheld
as
a
constitutional
exercise
of
the
tax
posed.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
further
holding
that
a
statute
is
valid
doesn't
justify
there
activity
or
their
conduct
on
failing
to
pay
the
tax
or
register.
now,
a
situation
such
as
in
the
james
case,
it
seems
to
us
is
a
different
one.
in
james
there
was
clear
authority
to
the
contrary
prior
to
the
court's
decision.
here
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
situation.
indeed,
the
petitioner
marchetti
in
one
question
admitted
that
he
knew
about
the
wagering
tax
law
but
he
said
that
nobody
buys
the
stamps
and
the
he
pays
enough
already.
petitioner
grosso
in
the
next
case,
his
defense
was
that
he
had
gotten
out
of
the
wagering
business
when
the
wagering
tax
laws
were
enacted.
he
didn't
want
to
mess
around
with
feds
so
he
got
out.
well,
that
defense
was
rejected
by
the
jury.
so
both
of
these
petitioners
knew
what
the
law
was
and
what
the
law
required
and
they
didn't
comply
with.
it
seems
to
us
that
under
those
circumstances
they
were
properly
convicted
and
if
the
court
adopts
either
of
the
rationales
the
government
suggests,
their
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
points
made
by
mr.
zeldes
that
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
first
is
that
his
position
doesn't
impinge
upon
the
congressional
power
to
tax
at
all.
i
think
that's
fallacious.
he
suggests
several
things.
he
says,
one,
congress
can
still
tax
but
what
it
can't
do
is
require
the
disclosure
of
information
that
might
be
used
against
a
particular
person
charged
with
the
payment
of
the
tax.
and
he
says
that,
“well,
congress
might
enact
an
immunity
statute.”
what
seems
to
me
that
you
--
we
get
to
that
only
if
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
problem
and
you
would
have
to
say
that
congress
at
least
can't
tax
the
way
it
has
taxed.
he
says
also
that,
“well,
you
can
pay
the
tax
anonymously.”
our
position
is
that
a
tax
that
has
to
be
paid
in
such
a
strange
and
unique
manner
in
which
the
taxpayer
doesn't
identify
himself,
give
his
address
just
isn't
administrable
as
a
practical
matter.
both
mr.
zeldes
and
professor
wright
say
over
and
over
again
that
there's
no
problem
here
with
sullivan.
we
agree
that
sullivan
is
distinguishable,
it's
different,
the
court
pointed
out
in
albertson
a
rationale
in
which
sullivan
differed
there.
but
it's
not
quite
all
that
easy
in
our
view.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
talk
about
the
fifth
amendment
as
protecting
a
person
for
many
link
or
lead
that
could
be
used
against
him
and
it's
very
difficult
to
conclude
that
a
taxpayer
filing
an
income
tax
return
in
which
he
refuses
to
disclose
the
source
on
the
grounds
of
the
fifth
amendment
hasn't
provided
some
link
or
some
lead.
now
the
court
has
been
willing
to
accept
sullivan
rationale.
it
did
so
in
albertson.
we
think
that
that
distinction
is
of
sound
--
but
that
raises
all
the
problems
that
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
white
have
been
talking
about.
and
it
raises
in
our
mind
the
question
of
whether
the
position
put
forward
here
in
effect,
the
tax
--
congress
can't
tax
in
the
way
it
has
is
of
sound.
one
of
the
things
that
was
thrown
out
here
was
the
point
that
the
wageing
tax
only
operates
on
essentially
illegal
activity
is
except
in
nevada.
well,
the
senate
committee
report
explains
why
bingo
games
and
parimutuel
betting
and
whatever
are
excluded.
it
seems
to
me
it's
pretty
sensible.
they
say
that
the
committee
has
excluded
the
above
types
of
gambling
not
because
of
any
belief
but
they
are
not
suitable
subjects
for
taxation.
however,
the
method
of
taxation
provided
while
particularly
appropriate
to
bookmaking
and
the
policy
operations
does
not
appear
readily
adoptable
to
these
other
forms
of
gambling.
and
then
with
respect
to
parimutuel
wagering
they
say
it
doesn't
apply
there
because
such
wagering
is
presently
subject
to
substantial
state
and
in
some
instances
local
taxation.
and
to
superimpose
a
federal
tax
upon
these
transactions
would
only
serve
to
maintain
the
existing
advantage
which
bookmakers
enjoy
over
parimutuel
betting
by
reason
of
their
immunity
on
parimutuel
taxes.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
question
really
is
whether
congress
can
put
an
excise
tax
on
gamblers.
we
have
taken
the
position
throughout
that
congress
can
do
so.
we
think
that
kahriger
and
lewis
provide
a
sensible
accommodation.
and
the
word
accommodation
as
it
seems
to
me
is
the
one
to
be
shy
away
from.
it's
the
term
the
court
used
in
murphy,
said
that
the
rule
that
they
adopted
there
was
one
that
would
accommodate
state
and
the
federal
interest.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
been
the
consistent
approach
of
at
least
the
majority
of
this
court.
the
fifth
amendment
is
consistently
accommodated
with
other
powers
that
exist
in
the
constitution.
it
does
not
exist
in
the
abstract,
it
exist
in
the
same
constitution
that
has
the
power
to
tax
and
power
to
do
other
thing.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
you
accommodated
a
way,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
you
make
it
unenforceable.
if
you
read
it
against
the
background
of
the
other
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
way
to
look
at
it.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
one
of
our
suggestions
is
that
the
court
adopts
the
rule
that
would
prevent
that.
a
restriction
on
the
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
repeal
the
fifth
amendment
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
makes
it
unenforceable.
it
protects
the
individual
against
the
harm
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect
him
against.
that
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
he
can
be
a
witness
against
himself,
your
honor
if
what
he
is
compelled
to
disclose
can't
be
used
against
him.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
you
adopt
the
rule
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
if
you
adopt
the
rule
similar
to
the
rule
adopted
in
the
murphy
case
by
this
court
which
is
a
prohibition
on
the
use
of
this
information
that
is
compelled
of
the
individual
in
any
subsequent
prosecution.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
could
have
been
a
thing
for
congress
to
do
in
the
murphy
situation.
but
the
court
didn't
do
that,
your
honor.
the
court
stated
that
it
was
adopting
an
exclusionary
rule
which
would
protect
the
individual
against
any
incriminatory
use.
and
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
exactly
understand
that
the
thrust
of
the
question
that
all
that
the
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
it's
not
an
exemption
from
prosecution,
that's
not
the
rule
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
not
from
prosecution,
your
honor,
from
use
of
the
information
which
is
compelled
or
its
fruits
as
a
link
or
lead
or
whatever.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
that
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
of
whether
and
how
he
can
later
be
prosecuted
for
the
substantive
offense.
he
may
or
he
may
not
be
able
to
depending
upon
how
this
information
is
used.
it
can't
be
introduced
under
this
rationale
against
him
in
a
subsequent
prosecution.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes,
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
essential
aspect
of
murphy
and
that
is
part
of
the
alternative
approach
that
we
suggest
here.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
other
approach
that
we
suggest
is
essentially
kahriger
and
lewis
as
far
as
we
can
determine
what
they
stand
for
and
what
they
speak
for.
kahriger
and
lewis
have
been
regarded
by
many
as
being
grounded
on
the
consideration
that
the
registration
requirement
involved
in
both
those
cases
was
simply
prospective
in
operation.
well,
it
is
perspective
in
a
sense
but
we
don't
rely
on
that
because
we
don't
think
that
that's
principle
basis
on
which
those
decisions
were
grounded.
particularly
in
the
lewis
case,
the
court
developed
the
approached
which
said
that
there
is
simply
no
compulsion
here
operative
in
the
fifth
amendment
sense.
and
there
isn't
any
because
a
person
considering
entering
into
gambling
has
a
free
choice,
clear
choice
as
to
whether
he
can
or
not.
when
he
does
make
the
decision
to,
he
should
be
regarded
as
having
assumed
the
tax
conditions
that
federal
government
attaches
to
that.
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
a
sensible
rationale
but
we
realized
that
the
court
wouldn't
have
taken
these
cases
to
reconsider
kahriger
and
lewis
in
light
of
albertson.
had
a
thought
that
rationale
was
completely
sound
and
subject
to
some
scrutiny.
and
we
suggest
therefore
that
if
in
light
of
albertson
and
if
in
light
of
the
courts
concern
with
this
problem,
it
should
feel
that
rationale
is
no
longer
a
viable
one
then
that
the
alternative
we
suggest
should
be
adopted.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
we
have
to
take
a
look
at
albertson
because
that's
really
what
we
are
reconsidering
these
cases
in
light
of.
albertson
is
--
the
court
is
of
course
aware
was
a
communist
party
registration
case.
there
the
registration
requirement
operated
on
people
who
had
already
been
found
by
the
subversive
activities
control
board
to
be
subject
to
registration.
there
the
registration
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes,
that
was
one
argument
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
found
that
the
--
they
agrees
with
the
government's
information
or
lack
thereof
was
not
a
pertinent
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
fortiori
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
in
that
respect,
perhaps.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
--
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
--
underlying
albertson
are
some
very
broad
and
some
difficult
implications
and
they
don't
just
involve
wagering,
they
involve
taxation
generally.
they
involve
regulation
by
government
generally.
the
whole
concept
of
self-reporting
and
disclosure
permeates
our
tax
and
our
regulatory
system.
and
if
we
are
going
to
get
to
the
position
where
the
fifth
amendment
excuses
anyone
might
feel
that
he
should
not
comply
because
it
might
incriminate
him.
then
serious
implications
are
raised
with
this
whole
program.
now,
there
are
regulatory
statutes
in
which
there
is
very
little
illegal
activity
and
in
which
it
would
be
difficult
for
one
to
conclude
that
how
could
he
possibly
involve
--
be
involved
in
a
crime.
without
speaking
to
the
--
that
question
directly,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
other
regulatory
statutes
in
which
some
people
do
engage
in
activity
lawfully
and
some
people
don't.
now,
albertson
spoke
about
the
problem
of
the
individual
determining
for
himself
without
determination
by
a
tribunal
that
he
was
authorized
to
claim
the
privilege.
that's
the
same
problem
that's
presented
with
respect
to
the
application
of
albertson,
its
other
context.
nobody
would
know
whether
these
people
really
had
a
privilege
claim
or
not.
the
problem
of
course
is
one
that
it
seems
to
us
can
be
resolved
at
least
in
the
alternative
via
restriction
on
the
incriminatory
use.
the
alternative
it
seems
to
me
in
operating
tax
and
regulatory
programs
is
just
an
undesirable
one.
and
the
alternative
is
that
nobody
would
be
compelled
or
required
to
disclose
anything.
the
government
would
have
to
go
out
and
get
this
information
from
people
by
agents
and
investigations.
i
think
that's
crazy.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
developed
a
system
here
in
which
people
do
have
to
come
forward
and
say
things
to
the
government
and
they
have
to
do
that
because
that's
the
way
to
run
the
--
these
programs.
now
whatever
implications
albertson
has
in
that
regard
it
seems
to
us
are
serious
and
important.
i
wold
like
to
speak
for
a
moment
on
the
problem
of
the
sullivan
case.
now
we
agree
that
the
income
tax
situation
is
different.
mr.
zeldes
pointed
out
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
we
inserted
in
our
brief
a
statement
that
no
specific
identification
or
source
was
required
with
respect
to
the
income
tax.
and
that's
right
but
as
i
pointed
out,
it
seems
to
us
quite
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
individual
income
tax
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
and
the
point
that
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
problem
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
in
practice
what
these
people
do,
they
say
--
they
tell
us
that
they're
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
my
understanding
of
what
is
done
with
the
present
practice
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
a
--
the
sullivan
rationale
as
we
understand
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
what
is
done
when
the
employer
is
one
that
--
generally
i
think
these
people
are
probably
self-employed
but
where
the
employer
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
if
disclosure
of
your
employer
would
be
incriminating
then
you
would
not
disclose
your
employer.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
that
you're
still
required
to
disclose
the
income
and
to
pay
tax
on
it.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
say
other
miscellaneous
or
i
think
most
of
the
people
that
are
in
that
situation
make
up
some
name
or
have
some
name
that
they
used
income.
that
isn't
incriminating
to
show
us
that
--
as
the
source.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
a
false
statement.
you
know,
if
they're
little
more
sophisticated.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no
i
don't
think
--
i
wasn't
implying
that
if
it's
a
wrong
name,
it
--
its
company
a,
if
company
a
is
really
a
company,
but
they
don't
disclose
what
business
company
a
is
in.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
didn't
get
to
that,
it's
been
read
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it's
been
read
subsequently
as
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that
precise
--
that's
right.
the
precise
question
in
sullivan
is
whether
you
could
fail
to
file
a
return
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
some
of
the
language
in
sullivan
is
i
pointed
out
is
pertinent
here.
sullivan
says
that
the
non-taxpayer
there
cannot
simply
draw
a
circle
around
his
activities
and
prevent
the
government
from
inquiring
at
all
into
the
--
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
the
tax
problem
by
not
filing
return
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
that
albertson
recognize
this
distinction.
in
albertson
the
court
said
to
one
of
the
claim
or
privilege
not
asserted
at
the
time
the
return
is
due
would
make
the
taxpayer,
rather
than
a
tribunal
(inaudible)
as
to
claim.
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
few
moments
to
the
alternative
rationale
that
we
discussed.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
matter
of
conferring
immunity
from
use
is
appropriate
for
congressional
and
judicial
determination.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
thing
could
be
said
about
the
problem
that
existed
in
murphy.
the
court
in
murphy
could
simply
have
said
that
there
is
a
problem
here
now
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
both
to
the
states
and
in
to
federal
government
and
that
these
individuals
can't
be
compelled
to
answer.
if
on
the
other
hand
congress
chooses
to
do
so,
it
can
enact
a
statute
which
would
protect
them
from
any
incriminating
use
of
this
information
in
a
federal
prosecution.
now
the
court
could
have
done
that
but
it
didn't
do
that.
the
court
adopted
what's
essentially
an
exclusionary
rule
that
the
court
has
clearly
the
power
to
do.
it's
done
it
in
other
circumstances
and
we
suggest
that
this
would
be
an
appropriate
thing
to
do
here.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that
what
must
be
disclosed?
the
fact
of
registration?
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
one
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
with
respect
to
6107
despite
the
implication
of
mr.
zeldes'
argument,
6107
was
not
enacted
along
with
the
wagering
tax,
it
antedates
it
considerably.
we
have
taken
the
position
in
our
brief
that
the
--
should
the
congress
--
should
the
court
feel
that
--
to
use
restriction
approach
should
be
taken
here,
the
internal
revenue
service
will
seek
amendment
of
6107
to
have
it
no
longer
related
to
the
wagering
tax
provision.
6107
relates
to
all
special
taxes
not
just
the
wagering
tax.
it
seems
to
us
that
under
the
fifth
amendment
so
long
as
the
information
that
the
government
obtains
from
anyone
is
confined
to
use
in
the
aid
of
collecting
taxes
that
no
self-incrimination
problem
arises.
the
guy
is
required
to
devolve
certain
information
to
the
government.
he
does
so.
it's
used
to
enforce
and
collect
taxes,
no
self-incrimination.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
he
cannot
be
harmed
with
respect
to
these
disclosures
unless
and
until
the
information
is
used
to
assist
and
convict
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
not
just
possible
that
he
might
if
a
murphy
type
of
rule
is
adopted
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us
that
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
murphy
that
the
problem
of
focusing
either
on
the
time
of
attempted
compulsion
or
the
time
of
attempted
use
of
incriminatory
information
is
no
longer
a
pertinent
one.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
murphy
took
that
into
account.
now,
murphy
said,
we
hold
the
constitutional
rule
provision
but
a
state
witness
may
not
be
compelled
to
give
testimony
which
may
be
incriminating
under
federal
law
unless
the
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
by
federal
officials
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
use
restriction
approach
as
to
reports
and
returns
that
are
affirmatively
filed.
it
seems
to
me
it
maybe
a
different
question
as
to
whether
the
same
sort
of
approach
is
either
required
or
desirable.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
shapiro
deals
with
and
it
may
are
things
that
are
ordinarily
and
regularly
maintained
by
people
that
have
because
of
their
relationship
to
the
governmental
program,
certain
aspects
that
--
to
make
them
suitable
to
governmental
or
public
scrutiny.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
does
talk
about
that.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
those
are
exactly
all
the
categories
there
are.
it
seems
to
me
the
question
may
be
whether
--
not
whether
the
particular
law
required
a
certain
record
or
whether
the
kind
of
record
required
was
such
that
it
ordinarily
be
kept.
and
there
were
the
cases
that
fall
into
the
side
of
that
kind
of
(inaudible).
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
said
that
my
answer
to
that
question
is
essentially
the
same
as
mr.
zeldes'
gave
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
problem
is
posed,
its
difficult
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
shapiro
would
apply
to
those
records
so
long
as
we
can
assume
that
the
taxpayer
ordinarily
would
keep
certain
kind
of
records
anyhow
of
that
type
in
conjunction
with
this
--
his
activity
whatever
they
may
be.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
difficulty
that
you
posed
is
this,
that
if
that's
so,
does
sullivan
make
sense?
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
right
because
it
seems
to
me
then
you'd
have
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
rationale
of
sullivan
that
the
taxpayer
doesn't
incriminate
himself
because
he
can
fail
to
disclose
the
source
if
that
source
is
illegal
may
be
something
of
a
track
cause
he
does
that
and
then
shapiro
is
thrown
out.
and
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
is.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
i
have
said
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
that's
--
that
is
a
different
situation
in
shapiro
because
you're
requiring
people
then
to
come
forward
and
do
things
they
otherwise
would
not
do.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
but
shapiro
relate
it
to
records
that
presumably
were
already
in
existence
and
maintained.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
requiring
somebody
to
come
forward
and
to
fill
these
things
out
than
maintain
records.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
any
prosecution
for
gambling
could
be
sustained.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
depends
upon
how
the
particular
prosecuting
authorities
come
about
their
information
if
they
go
into
the
guy's
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
gambling
prosecutions
would
continue
as
before.
that
doesn't
say
too
much
of
course,
but
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
you
think
that
after
adoption
of
this
kind
of
rule,
gamblers
will
suddenly
rush
in
and
they'll
all
register
and
they
all
pay
the
tax
which
would
be
very
nice
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
with
federal
government.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
those
difficulties
are
going
to
be
that
great
because
our
understanding
is
that
the
information
that
it
is
obtained
as
a
result
as
compliance
is
not
a
terribly
important
factor
as
to
whether
a
state
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes.
but
the
question
would
be
whether
but
before
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
be
whether
but
before
that
the
state
would
have
known
about
the
gun
and
the
problem
generally
isn't
whether
they
know
about
them
or
not,
whether
they
have
the
--
were
with
all
the
prosecutors.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
oh,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances
if
the
name
of
the
business
itself
would
be
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
there
isn't
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
there
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that's
our
reading
of
sullivan.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
and
sullivan
as
interpreted
in
albertson.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
of
any
here.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
in
what
context
would
that
question
be
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
difficult
to
answer
that
question
without
knowing
the
context
in
which
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
because
if
it
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
because
form
11-c
is
a
form
that's
required
to
be
completed
and
filed
in
conjunction
with
the
payment
of
a
tax.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
well,
it'd
be
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
but
in
your
hypothetical
it
seems
to
me
all
that
congress
would
doing
would
be
attempting
to
set
up
a
system
whereby
they
obtained
incriminating
information
about
people.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
we
don't
say
that
it
aviates
the
collision.
we
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
collision.
we
suggest
the
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
--
several
ways
of
resolving
that.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
waive
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
that
was
the
court's
wording.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
in
this
day
and
age
there
is
--
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
francis
x.beytagh,
jr.
just
for
few
moments,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
dispositions
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
kahriger
and
lewis
rationale,
the
non-compulsion
voluntary
choice
rationale
is
accepted
that
the
affirmance
is
as
dictated
here.
and
we
recognized
however
that
more
difficult
problems
presented
if
the
court
should
adopt
the
murphy
type
exclusionary
rule
approach.
we
recognized
that
in
murphy
the
court
reversed
the
civil
content
convictions
there
on
the
ground
that
the
individual
should
be
given
another
opportunity
to
testify.
we
think
however
that
our
circumstances
here
are
different.
and
that
they
do
not
necessarily
warrant
a
remand
or
reversal
if
a
use
restriction
approach
was
adopted.
the
petitioners
in
these
cases
knew
about
kahriger
and
lewis.
that
they
knew
that
the
statute
had
been
upheld
as
a
constitutional
exercise
of
the
tax
posed.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
further
holding
that
a
statute
is
valid
doesn't
justify
there
activity
or
their
conduct
on
failing
to
pay
the
tax
or
register.
now,
a
situation
such
as
in
the
james
case,
it
seems
to
us
is
a
different
one.
in
james
there
was
clear
authority
to
the
contrary
prior
to
the
court's
decision.
here
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
situation.
indeed,
the
petitioner
marchetti
in
one
question
admitted
that
he
knew
about
the
wagering
tax
law
but
he
said
that
nobody
buys
the
stamps
and
the
he
pays
enough
already.
petitioner
grosso
in
the
next
case,
his
defense
was
that
he
had
gotten
out
of
the
wagering
business
when
the
wagering
tax
laws
were
enacted.
he
didn't
want
to
mess
around
with
feds
so
he
got
out.
well,
that
defense
was
rejected
by
the
jury.
so
both
of
these
petitioners
knew
what
the
law
was
and
what
the
law
required
and
they
didn't
comply
with.
it
seems
to
us
that
under
those
circumstances
they
were
properly
convicted
and
if
the
court
adopts
either
of
the
rationales
the
government
suggests,
their
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
