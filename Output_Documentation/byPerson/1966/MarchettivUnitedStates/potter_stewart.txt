these
were

weren't

justice

that
--
that's
not
directly
involved
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
in
the
next
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
revise
form,
revised
as
of
july
1963,
the
one
which
is
appended
to
the
government's
brief
makes
some
verbal
changes
which
speak
prospectively.
that's
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
no.
but
i
--
that
--
those
changes
are
--
insofar
is
--
changes
are
made.
they
do
make
some
of
the
questions
operate
prospectively,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice

that
in

question

also,
“do
you
receive
or
will
you
be
receiving
wagers
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
i
--
as
i
understand
you
to
say
(inaudible)
is
not
just
there
would
be
immunity
but
that
no
evidence
that
is
in
the
form
of
the
(inaudible)
or
any
of
these
in
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
whatever
it
may
be
would
be
admissible
in
any
criminal
prosecution,
federal
or
state
and
that
in
the
event
to
such
a
prosecution,
the
state
or
the
federal
government
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
what
they
are
using
in
the
way
of
evidence
in
no
(inaudibe)
stands
from
the
registration.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
i
suppose
that
is
true
if
the
government
says
so.
but
my
recollection
of
the
form
1040
is
that
that's
not
that
accurate,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i'm
sure
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
matter
if
it
satisfy
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
don't
you
go
a
little
further
than
that
mr.
beytagh,
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
as
in
murphy
that
in
this
instances
where
you
do
get
this
information
but
subsequently
he
is
prosecuted
for
gambling
whether
by
state
or
under
some
federal
law.
the
prosecution
whether
it's
a
state
or
the
federal
government
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
evidence
used,
could
be
the
same
evidence,
i
take
it
was
derived
from
an
independent
source.
that
is
independent
of
any
information
that
he
disclosed.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
the
order
in
the
albertson
--
wasn't
the
order
directed
to
identified
individuals?
justice
potter
stewart
about
whom
the
government
already
had
a
great
deal
of
incriminating
information,
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
--
and
the
argument
that
the
government
made,
as
i
remember,
one
of
the
arguments
was
if
it
wasn't
self-incriminating
in
that
case
because
of
the
--
well,
for
these
people
to
register
would
not
add
a
bit
to
the
knowledge
of
the
government
already
have,
isn't
--
were
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
case,
would
it
be
true,
if
this
case
is
a
fortiori
from
albertson.
here,
the
government
did
not
have
any
knowledge
and
does
not
have
any
knowledge
about
professional
gamblers
presumably
until
they
are
required
to
come
in
and
identify
themselves,
turn
themselves
in,
is
that
true?
it's
a
fortiori
from
albertson.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
in
that
area,
in
that
respect?
justice
potter
stewart
or
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
so
accommodating
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
want
to
accommodate
it,
that's
your
word,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
i
thought
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
--
wouldn't
that
be
putting
on
of
an
unconstitutional
burden
(inaudible)
privilege
to
make
the
waiver
in
order
to
claim
the
deductions,
a
very
serious
problem
to
the
california
(inaudible)
comment.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
not
this
case.
but
i
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
how
--
i
don't
know
elsewhere
you
can
rely
on
the
points
you
just
made.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
has
to
waive
a
constitutional
privilege
in
order
to
get
statutory
induction?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
putting
it
firmly
on
