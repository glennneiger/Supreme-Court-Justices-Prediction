justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
about
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
you
didn't
have
to
fill
out
these
forms,
this
purchase
of
stamp?
justice
abe
fortas
would
it
take
some
--
on
robbers,
thieves,
receivers
of
stolen
drugs,
that's
all
it
takes
to
be
a
--
in
the
requirement
that
they
register
that
those
be
constitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
what's
the
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
supposed
who
is
--
i
supposed
you
could
say
the
same
receiving
stolen
property,
receiving
and
disposing
of
stolen
property.
how
about
receiving
and
disposing
of
automobiles?
i
gather
from
my
detective
story
reading
that
there
are
people
who
are
engaged
in
receiving
and
disposing
of
stolen
property,
(inaudible),
i
think
they're
called.
justice
abe
fortas
it
doesn't
--
why
would
--
why
do
you
have
any
doubt
about
it
and
is
that
because
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
because
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
limitations
on
the
federal
tax
law.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
why
can
the
federal
tax
power
extend
the
business
of
receiving
wagers
and
not
to
the
business
of
receiving
stolen
property?
why
wouldn't
this
be
an
easy
way
to
deal
with
the
narcotics
trade?
it
seems
to
be
difficult
to
find
and
get
evidence
on
those
people.
why
can't
the
federal
government
just
pass
a
statute
and
say
that
everybody
who
uses
narcotics,
or
everybody
in
needs,
in
the
business
of
selling
narcotics
has
to
register
and
then
that
the
--
doesn't
register
--
and
has
to
buy
tax
stamp
and
if
he
doesn't
do
so,
he
go
to
jail.
why
not
a
simple
and
easy
way
that
any
child
can
master
to
put
an
end
to
the
narcotics
trade
at
least
in
the
sense
of
--
i
think
--
and
easy
to
put
people
in
jail.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
unless
you
and
i
have
an
understanding
as
to
what's
fiction
and
what's
fact
and
legal
fiction
which
i
accept
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
raise
revenue
but
let's
don't
say
that
that's
it's
a
real
social
purpose,
it's
real
social
purposes
are
not
right
at
gambling
that
we
should
go
in
from
there
on
that
kind.
similarly,
the
--
this
case
i
put
to
you,
the
purpose
of
the
narcotics
tax
and
registration
requirement
would
be
to
strike
a
blow
at
narcotics.
it
would
also
in
illegal
purposes
raise
revenue
which
i
doubt
would
be
adequate
for
all
of
our
national
purposes.
and
what's
the
distinction
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
see
it?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
not
an
attitude,
it's
a
question.
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it
will
come
out
the
other
way.
justice
abe
fortas
then
why
did
they
ask
more
of
these
questions?
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
they
ask
him
questions
in
form
about
--
are
you
--
who
are
your
employees,
and
mr.
--
employees
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
pursue
that
line
of
inquiry
with
it
--
you,
because
you'd
never
persuade
me
with
that
one
but
what
is
the
distinction
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
still
--
are
you
still
taking
the
position
that
it
would
not
be
lawful
for
the
congress
to
enact
this
exactly
the
same
kind
of
law
and
apply
it
to
people
engaged
in
the
narcotics
business?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that,
but
here
is
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
about
this
tax
stamp
in
the
registration
technique?
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
that
true
in
so
many
fifth
amendment
cases?
when
you
say
that
a
school
teacher
does
not
teach
school
and
therefore
any
kind
of
oath
no
matter
how
objection
of
what
it
is
under
this
court's
decisions
in
not
compelled.
which
never
explain
that
kind
of
situation
in
your
present
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
that
argument
can
be
run
exactly
in
the
opposite
way,
that
is
to
say
that
in
the
tax
--
you're
taxing
wagering
and
acceptance
from
wagering
as
a
business.
what
you're
saying
here
is
that
in
order
to
engage
in
this
business,
the
person
has
to
make
a
disclosure
and
then
the
disclosure
is
a
disclosure
that
he's
engaged
in
illegal
activity.
so
it
couldn't
be
argued
that
the
compulsory
force
of
the
required
disclosure
is
even
greater
than
in
the
case
that
i
put
to
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
weren't
there
some
recent
hearings
about
the
work
done
by
--
i
think,
it
was
some
of
their
law
in
missouri.
recent
hearings
about
the
work
done
by
--
i
think
related
to
the
work
done
by
internal
revenue
service,
they
do
it
electronic
(inaudible)
on
that
subject.
justice
abe
fortas
of
hearings
that
had
to
do
with
their
work
in
conjunction
with
improper
justice,
wouldn't
it
indicate
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
a
basis
of
it
that
the
internal
revenue
service
is
engaged
in
the
policing
of
that
aspect
of
crime
which
shows
up
in
the
form
of
gambling,
ordinance
gambling.
justice
abe
fortas
but
don't
those
hearings
--
i
am
a
little
--
i'm
vague
about
this
but
i
have
a
vague
recollection
that
senator
long's
hearings
indicate
a
very
close
exchange
of
information
and
cooperation
between
internal
revenue
service
and
state
authorities
and
the
fbi.
do
you
have
a
recollection
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
in
enforcing
this
tax
and
i
suppose
that
it
equally
--be
argued
that
the
chicken
came
first
and
that
the
internal
revenue
service
did
this
in
connection
with
the
state
of
its
--
to
enforce
there
antigambling
laws
or
they
have
--
the
fbi's
work
whatever
it
may
be.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
but
i
still
have
one
trouble
with
you
because
in
your
statement,
i
don't
know
how
significant
that
will
occur
to
me
or
the
consistence
of
this
(inaudible)
honest
to
goodness
revenue
major,
and
you're
still
insisting
on
it.
justice
abe
fortas
you
used
two
words
that
have
interested
me,
you
said
that
the
material
cannot
be
used
and
then
you
used
a
word
to
indicate
that
it
would
have
to
be
excluded
that
if
this
disclosure
were
may
--
attempted
to
be
used
in
court
on
the
fruits
or
our
attempt
would
be
use
it,
would
that
be
excluded?
but
there
is
a
difference
between
those
two
concepts
as
if
there
--
that
is
to
say
if
these
incriminatory
statements
were
not
to
be
used,
that
means
that
they
would
not
be
--
nobody
would
be
given
access
to
them.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we've
never
done
that,
haven't
we?
remember
they
asserted
the
power
and
do
that
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
then
if
that
is
(inaudible)
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
we
would
have
the
power
to
say
that
this
information
cannot
be
used
in
the
sense
that
it
cannot
be
furnished
to
state
police
forces
for
purposes
of
leads
or
whatnot?
justice
abe
fortas
for
use
by
the
federal
government.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
are
deliberately
suggesting
in
--
something
more
than
an
exclusionary
rule
which
is
a
rule
of
nonuse
of
the
--
of
this
information.
it's
more
than
an
exclusionary
or
evidentiary
rule.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
straight
from
you.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
--
supposed
a
state
doesn't
introduce
any
evidence
whatever
to
the
effect
that
the
state
obtained
the
main
problem,
the
gambling
tax
records.
state
doesn't
--
so
there's
no
exclusionary
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
suggesting
something
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
any
event
there'd
be
some
kind
--
we
fashion
some
kind
of
a
nonuse
protection
here.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
suggesting
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
still
--
leave
me
without
an
answer
about
it,
in
all
fairness
and
i
have
to
say
that
to
you.
because
i
don't
know
yet
whether
you're
saying
that
we
tried
to
fashion
some
kind
of
a
rule
so
that
this
wagering
information
should
not
be
made
available
to
anybody?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
familiar
with
the
incident
with
free
--
john
lilburne
back
in
the
1640
or
whatever
it
was,
aren't
you?
that
started
the
whole
--
it
gave
this
tremendous
impetus
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
as
i
read
that,
he's
objection
was
to
self-accusation,
accusing
himself.
that
was
really
the
origin
of
--
all
that
this
has
led
to
this
troublesome
arrest
in
which
we
are
all
struggling.
but
unless
you
can
find
some
way
to
prevent
the
use
of
this
registration
information,
isn't
it
--
though
aren't
you
confronted
with
a
sort
of
a
prototype
of
a
preborn
john
situation
in
which
you're
asking
people
to
accuse
themselves
and
then
you're
saying
that
the
fruits
of
that
accusation
cannot
be
used
as
an
evidentiary
matter
but
it
may
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
starting
the
investigation
by
the
state
policemen
to
say.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
zeldes,
the
internal
revenue
code
requires
certain
electives
be
kept
by
the
taxpayer.
now,
would
your
theory
go
to
the
point
of
signing
that
such
requirements
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied
insofar
as
the
revenue
component
of
an
income
tax
return
reflect
the
proceeds
of
gambling.
justice
abe
fortas
yes
but
then
i'm
asking
you
whether
--
then
you've
got
to
keep
records,
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
internal
revenue
code
requires
you
to
keep
records
of
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
your
--
to
the
sums
that
you
report
on
the
income
tax
return,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
your
position
that
those
requirements
are
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they
require
the
disclosure
that
certain
sums
were
obtained
from
gambling?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
record
keeping
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
really
trying
to
get
to
mr.
zeldes
is,
number
one,
you're
your
theory
carry
us
to
the
point
where
we
would
have
to
anticipate
the
invalidation
if
we
accepted
your
theory
would
that
anticipate
the
invalidation
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
requirement
that
records
be
kept
and
made
available
on
demand
in
connection
with
income,
ordinary
income
tax
insofar
as
those
records
related
to
the
proceeds
of
gambling?
that's
point
one.
did
i
make
that
clear?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
and
point
two,
if
your
answer
is
“no”
that
your
theory
does
not
carry
to
the
point
of
invalidation
as
i
previously
--
as
i
tried
to
delineate
it
then
what
are
the
exact
elements
in
the
present
situation
which
in
your
mind
are
constitutionally
offensive
and
which
distinguish
the
present
situation
from
the
situation
that
would
be
presented
in
connection
to
ordinary
income
tax
payments.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
in
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
zeldes,
i
think
maybe
you
have
to
--
your
position
has
to
take
another
(inaudible)
than
that
because
all
other
taxpayers
for
example
would
have
to
file
out
a
schedule
but
the
showing
of
sources
of
income,
but
your
position
is
that
somebody
engaged
in
illegal
activity
would
not
have
to
do
that
because
of
the
fifth
amendment,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
know
that.
now,
let's
don't
get
into
that.
what's
your
theory?
what
is
your
theory
--
kahriger?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
you
missed
me
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
whites'
question
to
you
was
this,
if
you
are
--
the
taxpayer
is
required
to
fill
out
a
schedule
showing
the
source
of
income,
would
you
claim
that
person
engaged
in
illegal
gambling
would
not
have
to
do
so?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that's
what
i'm
getting
into.
so
that's
something
--
that's
a
privilege
that
he
has
by
reason
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
the
--
presumably
a
person
engaged
in
legal
income
producing
activities
does
not
have.
alright,
now
let's
sit
on
that,
are
you
with
me?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
the
second
thing
which
i
tried
to
get
at
in
my
question
to
you
is
this,
the
--
how
about
the
record
keeping
requirement
of
the
tax
laws.
tax
laws
require
certain
records
be
kept,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
as
in
your
position,
does
your
theory
in
this
case
take
you
to
the
point
of
saying
that
a
person
engaged
in
illegal
gambling
does
not
have
to
keep
those
records?
justice
abe
fortas
he
has
to
keep
the
records,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
--
well,
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
illogical?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
we'd
go
to
--
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
have
to
keep
the
records,
now
we
go
to
the
next
question
and
that
is
whether
upon
demand
they
had
--
pursuant
to
the
law
by
an
internal
revenue
agent
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
examine
that
particular
record,
does
the
person
who's
engaged
in
illegal
gambling
have
a
constitutional
right,
say
fifth
amendment,
i
won't
show
it
to
you.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i've
been
trying
to
get
from
you.
so
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
do
say
that
--
you
do
impeach
shapiro,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
do
you
read
shapiro?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
you
really
mean
to
say
that
if
we
read
shapiro
the
way
that
you
style
as
broadly
that
means
that
you
lose
this
case?
you
didn't
mean
to
say
that,
did
you?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
which
goes
beyond
your
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
but
i
thought
that
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right
but
it
--
and
it
does
go
beyond
your
present
case.
justice
abe
fortas
it
cannot
withstand
the
thrust
of
your
theory
in
this
case,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
now
if
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
but
if
--
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
could
the
federal
government
force
a
gambler
to
respond
to
the
following
question?
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
on
your
own
account?
or
would
he
be
able
to
defend
the
fifth
amendment
grounds?
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
no
context.
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
no
context.
the
government
adopts
the
statute
that
says,
“all
people
have
to
respond,
say
yes
or
no.”
and
mr.
marchetti
refuses
to
respond
on
the
defense
on
the
grounds
of
the
fifth
amendment,
would
mr.
marchetti
--
could
mr.
marchetti
be
convicted
under
a
federal
prosecution?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
giving
you
a
context,
the
government
passes
a
law
and
it
says,
“every
person
in
the
united
states,
(inaudible)
the
first
day
of
november,
perhaps
a
good
day,
has
to
file
a
statement
answering
this
question,
are
you
or
are
you
not
--
are
you
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
on
your
own
account?
and
mr.
marchetti
doesn't
file,
the
government
prosecutes
him
and
his
defense
is
the
fifth
amendment?
is
that
a
sound
constitutional
defense?
that's
--
the
kind
of
a
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
why
isn't
your
form
11-c
subject
to
a
fifth
amendment
affirmative
because
i've
read
to
you
that
if
you
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
critical
question
that's
maintained
on
form
11-c
and
i
further
understand
from
your
brief
that
you
concede
that
the
form
11-c
has
to
be
filled
out
on
the
--
first
in
pages
of
gambling
tax.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
yes
but
you're
telling
me
that
you
can't
force
a
man
to
answer
this
question.
now,
why
can't
you
force
a
man
as
in
the
question
on
form
11-c?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
not
magic
in
that
form
number,
is
there
to
overwrite
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
you
can
couple
this
to
tax,
to
couple
this
unconstitutional
inquiry,
would
the
assessment
and
collection
of
a
tax,
could
that
--
probably
it's
a
collision
with
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
--
are
you
saying
you
have
to
accommodate
it
and
against
the
fifth
amendment,
is
that
right?
and
you
come
out
with
the
result
against
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
instead
of
waive
the
fifth
amendment,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
about
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
you
didn't
have
to
fill
out
these
forms,
this
purchase
of
stamp?
justice
abe
fortas
would
it
take
some
--
on
robbers,
thieves,
receivers
of
stolen
drugs,
that's
all
it
takes
to
be
a
--
in
the
requirement
that
they
register
that
those
be
constitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
what's
the
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
supposed
who
is
--
i
supposed
you
could
say
the
same
receiving
stolen
property,
receiving
and
disposing
of
stolen
property.
how
about
receiving
and
disposing
of
automobiles?
i
gather
from
my
detective
story
reading
that
there
are
people
who
are
engaged
in
receiving
and
disposing
of
stolen
property,
(inaudible),
i
think
they're
called.
justice
abe
fortas
it
doesn't
--
why
would
--
why
do
you
have
any
doubt
about
it
and
is
that
because
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
because
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
limitations
on
the
federal
tax
law.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
why
can
the
federal
tax
power
extend
the
business
of
receiving
wagers
and
not
to
the
business
of
receiving
stolen
property?
why
wouldn't
this
be
an
easy
way
to
deal
with
the
narcotics
trade?
it
seems
to
be
difficult
to
find
and
get
evidence
on
those
people.
why
can't
the
federal
government
just
pass
a
statute
and
say
that
everybody
who
uses
narcotics,
or
everybody
in
needs,
in
the
business
of
selling
narcotics
has
to
register
and
then
that
the
--
doesn't
register
--
and
has
to
buy
tax
stamp
and
if
he
doesn't
do
so,
he
go
to
jail.
why
not
a
simple
and
easy
way
that
any
child
can
master
to
put
an
end
to
the
narcotics
trade
at
least
in
the
sense
of
--
i
think
--
and
easy
to
put
people
in
jail.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
unless
you
and
i
have
an
understanding
as
to
what's
fiction
and
what's
fact
and
legal
fiction
which
i
accept
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
raise
revenue
but
let's
don't
say
that
that's
it's
a
real
social
purpose,
it's
real
social
purposes
are
not
right
at
gambling
that
we
should
go
in
from
there
on
that
kind.
similarly,
the
--
this
case
i
put
to
you,
the
purpose
of
the
narcotics
tax
and
registration
requirement
would
be
to
strike
a
blow
at
narcotics.
it
would
also
in
illegal
purposes
raise
revenue
which
i
doubt
would
be
adequate
for
all
of
our
national
purposes.
and
what's
the
distinction
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
see
it?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
not
an
attitude,
it's
a
question.
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it
will
come
out
the
other
way.
justice
abe
fortas
then
why
did
they
ask
more
of
these
questions?
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
they
ask
him
questions
in
form
about
--
are
you
--
who
are
your
employees,
and
mr.
--
employees
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
pursue
that
line
of
inquiry
with
it
--
you,
because
you'd
never
persuade
me
with
that
one
but
what
is
the
distinction
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
still
--
are
you
still
taking
the
position
that
it
would
not
be
lawful
for
the
congress
to
enact
this
exactly
the
same
kind
of
law
and
apply
it
to
people
engaged
in
the
narcotics
business?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that,
but
here
is
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
about
this
tax
stamp
in
the
registration
technique?
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
that
true
in
so
many
fifth
amendment
cases?
when
you
say
that
a
school
teacher
does
not
teach
school
and
therefore
any
kind
of
oath
no
matter
how
objection
of
what
it
is
under
this
court's
decisions
in
not
compelled.
which
never
explain
that
kind
of
situation
in
your
present
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
that
argument
can
be
run
exactly
in
the
opposite
way,
that
is
to
say
that
in
the
tax
--
you're
taxing
wagering
and
acceptance
from
wagering
as
a
business.
what
you're
saying
here
is
that
in
order
to
engage
in
this
business,
the
person
has
to
make
a
disclosure
and
then
the
disclosure
is
a
disclosure
that
he's
engaged
in
illegal
activity.
so
it
couldn't
be
argued
that
the
compulsory
force
of
the
required
disclosure
is
even
greater
than
in
the
case
that
i
put
to
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
weren't
there
some
recent
hearings
about
the
work
done
by
--
i
think,
it
was
some
of
their
law
in
missouri.
recent
hearings
about
the
work
done
by
--
i
think
related
to
the
work
done
by
internal
revenue
service,
they
do
it
electronic
(inaudible)
on
that
subject.
justice
abe
fortas
of
hearings
that
had
to
do
with
their
work
in
conjunction
with
improper
justice,
wouldn't
it
indicate
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
a
basis
of
it
that
the
internal
revenue
service
is
engaged
in
the
policing
of
that
aspect
of
crime
which
shows
up
in
the
form
of
gambling,
ordinance
gambling.
justice
abe
fortas
but
don't
those
hearings
--
i
am
a
little
--
i'm
vague
about
this
but
i
have
a
vague
recollection
that
senator
long's
hearings
indicate
a
very
close
exchange
of
information
and
cooperation
between
internal
revenue
service
and
state
authorities
and
the
fbi.
do
you
have
a
recollection
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
in
enforcing
this
tax
and
i
suppose
that
it
equally
--be
argued
that
the
chicken
came
first
and
that
the
internal
revenue
service
did
this
in
connection
with
the
state
of
its
--
to
enforce
there
antigambling
laws
or
they
have
--
the
fbi's
work
whatever
it
may
be.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
but
i
still
have
one
trouble
with
you
because
in
your
statement,
i
don't
know
how
significant
that
will
occur
to
me
or
the
consistence
of
this
(inaudible)
honest
to
goodness
revenue
major,
and
you're
still
insisting
on
it.
justice
abe
fortas
you
used
two
words
that
have
interested
me,
you
said
that
the
material
cannot
be
used
and
then
you
used
a
word
to
indicate
that
it
would
have
to
be
excluded
that
if
this
disclosure
were
may
--
attempted
to
be
used
in
court
on
the
fruits
or
our
attempt
would
be
use
it,
would
that
be
excluded?
but
there
is
a
difference
between
those
two
concepts
as
if
there
--
that
is
to
say
if
these
incriminatory
statements
were
not
to
be
used,
that
means
that
they
would
not
be
--
nobody
would
be
given
access
to
them.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we've
never
done
that,
haven't
we?
remember
they
asserted
the
power
and
do
that
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
then
if
that
is
(inaudible)
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
we
would
have
the
power
to
say
that
this
information
cannot
be
used
in
the
sense
that
it
cannot
be
furnished
to
state
police
forces
for
purposes
of
leads
or
whatnot?
justice
abe
fortas
for
use
by
the
federal
government.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
are
deliberately
suggesting
in
--
something
more
than
an
exclusionary
rule
which
is
a
rule
of
nonuse
of
the
--
of
this
information.
it's
more
than
an
exclusionary
or
evidentiary
rule.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
straight
from
you.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
--
supposed
a
state
doesn't
introduce
any
evidence
whatever
to
the
effect
that
the
state
obtained
the
main
problem,
the
gambling
tax
records.
state
doesn't
--
so
there's
no
exclusionary
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
suggesting
something
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
any
event
there'd
be
some
kind
--
we
fashion
some
kind
of
a
nonuse
protection
here.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
suggesting
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
still
--
leave
me
without
an
answer
about
it,
in
all
fairness
and
i
have
to
say
that
to
you.
because
i
don't
know
yet
whether
you're
saying
that
we
tried
to
fashion
some
kind
of
a
rule
so
that
this
wagering
information
should
not
be
made
available
to
anybody?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
familiar
with
the
incident
with
free
--
john
lilburne
back
in
the
1640
or
whatever
it
was,
aren't
you?
that
started
the
whole
--
it
gave
this
tremendous
impetus
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
as
i
read
that,
he's
objection
was
to
self-accusation,
accusing
himself.
that
was
really
the
origin
of
--
all
that
this
has
led
to
this
troublesome
arrest
in
which
we
are
all
struggling.
but
unless
you
can
find
some
way
to
prevent
the
use
of
this
registration
information,
isn't
it
--
though
aren't
you
confronted
with
a
sort
of
a
prototype
of
a
preborn
john
situation
in
which
you're
asking
people
to
accuse
themselves
and
then
you're
saying
that
the
fruits
of
that
accusation
cannot
be
used
as
an
evidentiary
matter
but
it
may
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
starting
the
investigation
by
the
state
policemen
to
say.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
zeldes,
the
internal
revenue
code
requires
certain
electives
be
kept
by
the
taxpayer.
now,
would
your
theory
go
to
the
point
of
signing
that
such
requirements
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied
insofar
as
the
revenue
component
of
an
income
tax
return
reflect
the
proceeds
of
gambling.
justice
abe
fortas
yes
but
then
i'm
asking
you
whether
--
then
you've
got
to
keep
records,
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
internal
revenue
code
requires
you
to
keep
records
of
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
your
--
to
the
sums
that
you
report
on
the
income
tax
return,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
your
position
that
those
requirements
are
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they
require
the
disclosure
that
certain
sums
were
obtained
from
gambling?
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
record
keeping
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
really
trying
to
get
to
mr.
zeldes
is,
number
one,
you're
your
theory
carry
us
to
the
point
where
we
would
have
to
anticipate
the
invalidation
if
we
accepted
your
theory
would
that
anticipate
the
invalidation
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
requirement
that
records
be
kept
and
made
available
on
demand
in
connection
with
income,
ordinary
income
tax
insofar
as
those
records
related
to
the
proceeds
of
gambling?
that's
point
one.
did
i
make
that
clear?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
and
point
two,
if
your
answer
is
“no”
that
your
theory
does
not
carry
to
the
point
of
invalidation
as
i
previously
--
as
i
tried
to
delineate
it
then
what
are
the
exact
elements
in
the
present
situation
which
in
your
mind
are
constitutionally
offensive
and
which
distinguish
the
present
situation
from
the
situation
that
would
be
presented
in
connection
to
ordinary
income
tax
payments.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
in
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
zeldes,
i
think
maybe
you
have
to
--
your
position
has
to
take
another
(inaudible)
than
that
because
all
other
taxpayers
for
example
would
have
to
file
out
a
schedule
but
the
showing
of
sources
of
income,
but
your
position
is
that
somebody
engaged
in
illegal
activity
would
not
have
to
do
that
because
of
the
fifth
amendment,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
know
that.
now,
let's
don't
get
into
that.
what's
your
theory?
what
is
your
theory
--
kahriger?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
you
missed
me
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
whites'
question
to
you
was
this,
if
you
are
--
the
taxpayer
is
required
to
fill
out
a
schedule
showing
the
source
of
income,
would
you
claim
that
person
engaged
in
illegal
gambling
would
not
have
to
do
so?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that's
what
i'm
getting
into.
so
that's
something
--
that's
a
privilege
that
he
has
by
reason
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
the
--
presumably
a
person
engaged
in
legal
income
producing
activities
does
not
have.
alright,
now
let's
sit
on
that,
are
you
with
me?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
the
second
thing
which
i
tried
to
get
at
in
my
question
to
you
is
this,
the
--
how
about
the
record
keeping
requirement
of
the
tax
laws.
tax
laws
require
certain
records
be
kept,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
as
in
your
position,
does
your
theory
in
this
case
take
you
to
the
point
of
saying
that
a
person
engaged
in
illegal
gambling
does
not
have
to
keep
those
records?
justice
abe
fortas
he
has
to
keep
the
records,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
--
well,
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
illogical?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
we'd
go
to
--
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
have
to
keep
the
records,
now
we
go
to
the
next
question
and
that
is
whether
upon
demand
they
had
--
pursuant
to
the
law
by
an
internal
revenue
agent
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
examine
that
particular
record,
does
the
person
who's
engaged
in
illegal
gambling
have
a
constitutional
right,
say
fifth
amendment,
i
won't
show
it
to
you.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i've
been
trying
to
get
from
you.
so
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
do
say
that
--
you
do
impeach
shapiro,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
do
you
read
shapiro?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
you
really
mean
to
say
that
if
we
read
shapiro
the
way
that
you
style
as
broadly
that
means
that
you
lose
this
case?
you
didn't
mean
to
say
that,
did
you?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
which
goes
beyond
your
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
but
i
thought
that
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right
but
it
--
and
it
does
go
beyond
your
present
case.
justice
abe
fortas
it
cannot
withstand
the
thrust
of
your
theory
in
this
case,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
now
if
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
but
if
--
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
could
the
federal
government
force
a
gambler
to
respond
to
the
following
question?
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
on
your
own
account?
or
would
he
be
able
to
defend
the
fifth
amendment
grounds?
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
no
context.
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
no
context.
the
government
adopts
the
statute
that
says,
“all
people
have
to
respond,
say
yes
or
no.”
and
mr.
marchetti
refuses
to
respond
on
the
defense
on
the
grounds
of
the
fifth
amendment,
would
mr.
marchetti
--
could
mr.
marchetti
be
convicted
under
a
federal
prosecution?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
giving
you
a
context,
the
government
passes
a
law
and
it
says,
“every
person
in
the
united
states,
(inaudible)
the
first
day
of
november,
perhaps
a
good
day,
has
to
file
a
statement
answering
this
question,
are
you
or
are
you
not
--
are
you
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
on
your
own
account?
and
mr.
marchetti
doesn't
file,
the
government
prosecutes
him
and
his
defense
is
the
fifth
amendment?
is
that
a
sound
constitutional
defense?
that's
--
the
kind
of
a
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
why
isn't
your
form
11-c
subject
to
a
fifth
amendment
affirmative
because
i've
read
to
you
that
if
you
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
critical
question
that's
maintained
on
form
11-c
and
i
further
understand
from
your
brief
that
you
concede
that
the
form
11-c
has
to
be
filled
out
on
the
--
first
in
pages
of
gambling
tax.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
yes
but
you're
telling
me
that
you
can't
force
a
man
to
answer
this
question.
now,
why
can't
you
force
a
man
as
in
the
question
on
form
11-c?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
not
magic
in
that
form
number,
is
there
to
overwrite
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
you
can
couple
this
to
tax,
to
couple
this
unconstitutional
inquiry,
would
the
assessment
and
collection
of
a
tax,
could
that
--
probably
it's
a
collision
with
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
--
are
you
saying
you
have
to
accommodate
it
and
against
the
fifth
amendment,
is
that
right?
and
you
come
out
with
the
result
against
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
instead
of
waive
the
fifth
amendment,
is
that
it?
