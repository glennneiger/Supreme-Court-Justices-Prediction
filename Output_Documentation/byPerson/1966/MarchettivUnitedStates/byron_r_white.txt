is
the
form
--
is
the
registration
form
here
in
the

justice
byron

white
is
this
in
that
costello
record?
justice
byron

white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
--
i
guess
you
do
had
your
choice
don't
you,
of
either
putting
gambling
or
filing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
doesn't
gamble?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
not
gambling?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
an
honest
gambler?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
honest
gambler?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
you
could.
suppose
the
law
had
said
so.
all
you
have
to
do
is
quit
gambling
and
you
don't
have
to
register
even
if
you've
been
a
gambler
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
you
just
argue
that
it's
a
violation
of
fifth
amendment
even
if
it's
fully
prospective?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
haven't
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you're
just
suggesting
murphy,
does
murphy
approach,
aren't
you
that
essentially
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
can
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
you
say
that
shapiro
is
in
the
--
is
irrelevant
with
the
paid
stamp?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
that's
hardly
the
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
go
ahead,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
your
answering
to
fortas,
keep
going
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
shapiro
said
that
those
--
said
that
you
could
make
and
keep
the
records,
you
can
also
subpoena
them
and
make
the
taxpayer
produce
them.
not
just
come
in
and
inspect
them
but
produce
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
they
may
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
say
that's
a
wholly
different
situation,
wholly
irrelevant
to
this
case
where
instead
of
having
them
keep
them
or
produce
they
say
in
advance
file.
file
this
information.
don't
just
keep
it
and
make
the
subpoena
that
we
are
subpoenaing
it
in
advance.
you
keep
it
now,
file
it
now.
and
you
say
that's
a
wholly
different
situation
with
shapiro
--
justice
byron
r.
white
shapiro
is
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
--
the
gamblers
don't
keep
records
of
their
employees
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
do
you
suggest
the
--
that
only
as
an
alternative.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
about
mr.
justice
blacks'
question
on
without
the
alternative?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
on
--
my
individual
income
tax
return
if
i
have
a
--
i'm
operating
a
business,
i
don't
have
to
come
out
and
get
(inaudible)
or
whatever
it
is,
that
just
didn't
--
i
could
just
ignore
whenever
i
sit
down
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
am
i.
justice
byron
r.
white
anybody
who
is
running
an
individual
business
where
he
doesn't
have
to
--
well,
he
has
income,
and
doesn't
have
to
take
depreciations,
in
fact
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
schedule,
sooner
or
later
he's
going
to
have
to
get
around
to
--
pretty
well
join
this
kind
of
a
business
is
that
--
he's
going
to
deduct
his
expenses,
pretty
well,
its
--
he's
going
to
have
to
show
that
isn't
true.
and
he
can
just
forget
the
--
filling
out
that
schedule?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
what
people
--
do
you
say
you
don't
have
to
show
the
source
of
your
income
in
your
income
returns,
is
that
right
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
i
don't
have
to
show
where
--
who
my
employer
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
have
to
given
this
information,
and
i
don't
know
why
they
even
send
you
the
return.
first
question,
who
is
your
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
we're
not
--
(inaudible)
people,
we're
talking
about
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
get
to
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
--
i
suppose,
that
--
since
the
government
relies
so
heavily
on
(inaudible),
it
wants
to
put
shapiro
aside,
you
would
not
want
to
use
restriction
if
the
district
court
(inaudible)
into
this
case
would
apply
to
the
situations
so
that
shapiro
would
apply.
well,
shapiro
of
course
permitted
the
use
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
furthermore,
it's
permitted
it
after
--
an
answer
to
his
subpoena
afforded
to
taxpyer
himself
with
this
directive.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
shapiro
would
have
at
least
talks
about
records
that
the
law
required
them
to
keep?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
would
say
that
they
were
also,
but
they
wouldn't
apply
to
records
that
--
that
shapiro
wouldn't
apply
unless
the
records
since
the
law
required
them
to
keep
also
their
records
which
they
normally
(inaudible)
kept.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
shapiro
would
permit
or
recover
the
situation
under
the
income
tax
or
the
taxpayer
reveals
some
income
because
he
showed
the
source
of
it
if
the
law
requires
them
to
keep
records
showing
his
income
and
the
internal
revenue
service
then
asked
him
to
produce
the
records
verifying
this
amount
of
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
wanted
--
do
you
think
shapiro
would
cover
that
situation
and
permit
the
government
to
get
the
record
to
use
them
against
--
in
on
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
shapiro
would
permit
the
government
to
subpoena
them
and
to
use
them
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
with
the
subpoena
but
should
shapiro
permit
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
it
doesn't
mean
the
same
thing
if
the
--
that
the
fellow
does
keep
records
showing
his
income
like
the
law
requires
them
to
do
it.
and
the
government
says,
“now,
produce
it.”
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
so
the
taxpayer
could
--
just
right
across
this
--
i
claim
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
filed
here.
do
you
concede
that?
are
you
--
is
that
your
position?
is
that
--
you
can
think
that's
what
the
(inaudible)?
is
there
any
provision
in
the
law
to
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
there
any
regulation
to
that
effect?
justice

it's
just
your
reading
of
