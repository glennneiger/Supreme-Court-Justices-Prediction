mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
government's
view
what
this
in
the
related
cases
really
involved
is
whether
gamblers
can
refuse
to
pay
a
tax
because
the
business
--
their
engagement
is
illegal.
petitioner
in
this
case
as
has
been
pointed
out
was
convicted
for
failing
to
register
as
required
under
the
federal
wagering
tax
laws
and
also
for
failure
to
pay
the
special
occupational
tax,
$50
tax,
on
those
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers.
on
the
companion
grosso
case
which
we'll
be
argued
subsequently,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
for
failure
to
pay
the
10%
excise
tax
on
grocery
receipts
from
wagering.
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
deal
at
length
with
the
fact
that
professional
gambling
is
one
of
the
largest
business
enterprises
in
this
country.
and
although
gamblers
gross
many
billions
of
dollars
per
year,
it's
common
knowledge
that
they
pay
very
little
on
taxes.
now,
they're
of
course
--
they
are
of
course
subject
to
income
taxation
but
obviously
collection
is
very
difficult
because
of
the
nature
of
their
operations.
unlike
many
other
businesses,
gambling
has
been
subjected
by
congress
to
an
excise
tax,
a
wagering
tax
that's
here
at
issue.
this
tax
as
the
court
well
knows
was
upheld
by
this
court
over
constitutional
attack
in
the
kahriger
and
lewis
cases
decided
in
1953
and
1955.
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case,
limited
to
the
question
whether
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
last
term,
in
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board,
kahriger
and
lewis
should
be
overruled.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
for
the
reference
i
think
in
the
grant
was
to
kahriger
and
lewis
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
in
our
view,
those
cases
properly
considered
and
properly
construed
are
still
good
law.
should
the
court
disagree
however
and
find
merit
in
petitioner's
fifth
amendment
contentions
we
suggest
that
the
appropriate
result
here
would
be
to
uphold
the
wagering
tax
laws
while
adopting
a
rule
prohibiting
the
use
of
any
information
disclosed
as
a
result
of
compliance
with
those
laws,
in
any
subsequent
criminal
prosecution.
before
discussing
kahriger
and
lewis
in
the
context
of
albertson,
which
is
of
course
the
central
issue
here,
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
on
our
view
of
the
substance
of
the
constitutional
claim
asserted
by
petitioners
in
this
--
in
the
related
cases.
they
don't
deny
that
they're
gamblers.
indeed,
that's
essential
to
their
constitutional
contention.
they
don't
assert
that
the
wagering
tax
is
not
a
tax
major,
they
slap
at
it
occasionally.
such
a
position,
i
think
they
recognize
would
fly
squarely
in
the
face
of
this
court's
limited
grant
of
certiorari.
and
they
don't
deny
that
under
the
wagering
tax
laws,
they
were
required
to
register
as
being
engaged
in
the
business
for
accepting
wagers
and
we're
required
to
pay
the
prescribed
taxes.
what
they
say
however
is
this.
they
say
that
they're
excused
from
compliance
with
the
wagering
tax
laws
because
of
the
fifth
amendment.
since
gambling
is
illegal
under
the
laws
of
most
states,
compliance
with
the
wagering
tax
laws
they
assert
would
require
them
to
incriminate
themselves.
this
they
say
they
can't
be
compelled
to
do,
since
the
fifth
amendment's
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
now
under
this
court's
decision
in
malloy
versus
hogan
fully
applicable
to
the
states.
in
petitioner's
view
in
short,
state
law
has
the
effect
of
limiting
the
federal
tax
problem.
thus
they
conclude
they
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
failure
to
register,
file
a
return
to
pay
the
taxes.
as
against
the
statutory
requirements,
what
they
essentially
assert
is
the
right
to
remain
silent
or
right
to
go
on
with
their
business
in
privacy.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
doubt
it
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
engagement
in
that
activity
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
an
ongoing,
continuing
sort
of
business
in
the
same
sense
that
gambling
is.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
reiken
(ph)
case
and
mr.
justice
black
said
in
the
dissent
there
that
gambling
and
activities
like
that
are
recognized,
it's
ongoing
businesses
whereas
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
those
questions
are
difficult
and
have
to
--
would
have
to
be
resolved
with
respect
to
each
individual
situation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
more
because
of
the
limitations
on
the
federal
tax
power
and
in
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
the
purpose
is
to
put
an
end
to
the
narcotics
trade
and
not
to
obtain
revenue,
then
a
question
is
raised
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
by
congress
of
the
powers
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
with
all
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
with
all
deference
your
honor,
when
i
first
get
involved
in
looking
into
these
cases,
i
had
the
same
attitude
that
you
have.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
this
thing,
and
the
one
at
the
background
of
its
enactment,
there
really
were
people
in
congress
that
thought
it
was
going
to
provide
revenue
and
they
were
concerned
about
the
problem
of
gambling
being
increasingly
large
enterprise
that
didn't
pay
a
substantial
amount
of
taxes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
one
of
the
reasons
for
asking
about
employees
is
that
the
employers
are
supposed
to
have
a
stamp
also.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
in
all
candor
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
there
are
similar
laws
that
relate
to
people
in
the
narcotics
business.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
depends
your
honor
on
an
assessment
of
the
business-like
nature
of
what's
going
on
here,
whether
it's
legal
or
illegal.
i
think
all
of
these
taxes
are
close
to
the
borderline
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
the
exercised
power
by
congress.
and
the
--
that
the
prior
cases
on
taxes
like
this
have
involved
this
court's
opinions,
have
involved
the
discussion
of
this
consideration.
some
deference
i
think
must
be
given
to
the
congressional
judgment,
that
the
matter
is
an
appropriate
one
to
tax.
now
the
farther
away
you
get
it
seems
to
me
from
a
legitimate
business
activity
or
business
activity
that
goes
on
a
substantial
proportion
so
that
congress
could
make
a
judgment
that
it
would
produce
some
revenue,
the
more
questionable
the
exercise
gets.
and
at
some
point,
i
suppose
that
the
power
as
you
serve.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
--
well,
the
--
simply
could
impose
it.
i
think
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
collect
the
tax.
the
purpose
of
registration
which
is
a
fairly
common
provision
in
most
excised
tax
situations
is
to
assist
the
government
in
identifying
the
people
that
are
required
to
pay
the
tax,
so
as
to
assist
in
the
enforcement
of
it.
if
there
was
no
registration
requirement
here,
but
there
was
a
tax,
it
seems
to
me
that
some
taxes
still
continue
to
be
collected
but
enforcement
would
be
made
more
difficult.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
you
assume
that
the
government
can
collect
the
tax
and
require
compliance
with
the
tax
laws
which
won't
in
any
sense
run
afoul
with
the
fifth
amendment
then
i
think
there's
a
difference.
but
if
you
say
that
the
registration
provision
causes
serious
fifth
amendment
problems
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
serious
fifth
amendment
problems,
then
--
problems
of
incrimination.
you
can
make
distinction
but
i
think
that
it's
--
i
think
it
somewhat
difficult
to
make
distinctions
which
would
uphold
the
power
to
tax
without
allowing
congress
to
impose
reasonable
incidence
to
the
exercise
of
that
power
such
as
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
the
sullivan
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
the
sullivan
case?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
holding
of
sullivan
is
--
as
we
view
it
simply
that
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
excuse
one
in
failing
to
file
an
income
tax
return
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
i
see
some
differences
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
sullivan
says
is
as
we
read
it,
is
that
the
government
can
compel
a
person
to
comply
with
the
income
tax
law
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
file
a
return.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
get
to
that
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that
question
wasn't
involved
in
sullivan.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
well
the
prosecution
was
for
failure
to
file
a
return.
and
he
said
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
may
or
it
may
not
have
depending
on
--
you
know
what
this
guy
had
been
doing
there.
i
think
he
had
some
income
from
illegal
liquor
activities
as
i
recall.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
part
of
the
law
that
we
have
here,
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
aspect
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i
think
that
--
that's
a
distinction
that
we
suggest
in
our
briefs
that
the
question
is
involved
in
the
subsequent
case
more
probably
because
that
is
the
nonpayment
situation.
before
turning
to
our
argument,
i
should
mention
as
a
--
just
refer
that
--
since
nonpayment
of
the
excise
tax
is
involved
in
the
subsequent
grosso
case,
i
shall
--
may
confine
any
further
discussion
here
to
the
non-registration,
nonpayment
of
the
occupational
tax.
i
should
add
that
registration
and
payment
of
this
occupational
tax
really
a
--
one
identical
act.
you
register,
you
file
a
return
and
pay
the
$50
at
one
time
and
get
the
stamp
back.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
what
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
now,
the
registration
form
or
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
or
the
tax
of
the
excise
tax
return
form?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
both.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
we
concede
that
the
registration
form
requires
a
greater
amount
of
potentially
incriminating
information.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
you
say
the
pervasive
effect
is
there
--
there
is
more
information
called
for
and
in
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
depends
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
the
person
that's
required
to
file
is
someone
who
under
--
in
his
state
is
engaging
in
activities
that
are
illegal,
most
of
the
questions
on
that
form
call
for
information
that
could
be
subsequently
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution
for
gambling.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
think
that
kahriger
and
lewis
properly
understood
or
are
outside
of
albertson
but
for
several
reasons
as
we
developed
in
the
briefs
and
now
developed
here.
it's
a
difficult
argument
to
make
and
obviously
we
wouldn't
have
made
the
alternative
argument
have
we
been
completely
satisfied
with
our
position.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
nobody.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
state
affirmed.
unless
they
show
that
any
information
that
was
used
came
from
a
wholly
independent
source
as
murphy
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
the
way
this
case
--
these
particular
cases
come
up,
i
don't
think
there's
a
required
records
problem
in
them.
now,
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
that's
amplified
by
regulation
that
requires
the
keeping
of
daily
wagering
records
that
are
related
to
the
excise
tax.
in
a
situation
in
which
you
had
some
of
these
records
kept
and
introduced,
you
may
have
a
shapiro
situation,
we
don't
have
it
here.
i
--
we
haven't
attempted
to
argue
that
the
returns
themselves
are
records.
there's
some
indications
at
least
in
various
opinions
that
things
that
you're
required
to
file
and
not
keep
as
a
business
matter
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
required
records
doctrine.
in
our
view
as
i
stated
kahriger
and
lewis
correctly
interpreted
provide
an
acceptable
rationale
for
decision
here
not
undermined
by
albertson.
now
one
of
the
grounds
for
decision
in
kahriger
and
mistakenly
regarded
in
our
view
by
some
as
the
sole
ground
was
that
the
registration
required
was
prospective
in
operation,
therefore
there
wasn't
any
incrimination
problem.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
your
honor.
we
do
point
out
that
the
under
the
form
now
in
used,
and
i
should
mention
because
this
question
came
up
yesterday.
the
only
reason
we
included
the
present
form
is
because
we
didn't
know
until
we'd
got
into
this
case,
they'd
revised
a
thing.
we
didn't
mean
to
intimate
at
all
that
this
form
was
available
and
should've
been
used
by
petitioners
here.
i
don't
know
what
was
available
to
them
in
connecticut
and
i'm
going
to
accept
that
the
old
form
was,
but
it
may
be
relevant
to
the
court
that
the
revised
form
is
in
certain
--
pertinent
respects
different
from
the
old.
this
form
bears
a
date
of
1963
and
was
--
and
we
requested
from
the
internal
revenue
service
in
forms
the
one
that
they
provided
to
us
is
the
one
that's
now
in
used.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
one
of
the
problems
that
was
involved
in
the
enactment
of
this
thing
was
senator
kefauver's
strong
opposition.
he
kept
pointing
this
out.
he
said,
this
is
an
ill-conceived
statute.
it's
ill-conceived
because
it
looks
like
the
federal
government
is
authorizing
or
sanctioning
in
the
engagement
in
the
business
of
gambling
and
he
opposed
it
throughout.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
his
opposition
is
relevant.
he
was
probably
the
person
at
that
time
in
the
congress,
most
knowledgeable
about
organized
gambling.
congress
enacted
this
along
with
the
whole
array
of
excise
taxes
to
provide
revenue
for
the
korean
war
problem.
and
as
i
was
discussing
with
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
all
candor,
we
--
there
are
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
more
than
a
revenue
purpose
in
mind.
but
their
indication's
the
other
way.
the
tax
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
any
studies
have
been
made
as
the
petitioner
refers
--
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
at
one
point
in
time
in
1961
stated
that
it
cost
more
to
collect
this
tax
than
the
tax
produced.
the
tax
has
produced
money.
it's
produced
a
hundred
million
dollars
in
the
15
years
of
its
operation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
one
--
about
a
hundred
million
dollars.
we
don't
stand
as
i
said
on
this
prospective
--
retrospective
distinction,
but
we
think
that
this
ground
was
neither
the
sole
nor
the
primary
one
for
decision
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
those
cases
the
registration
requirement
does
not
compel
the
individual
to
make
incriminating
disclosures
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
he
has
a
clear
and
available
choice
as
an
initial
matter
as
to
whether
they're
engaged
or
not
engaged
in
a
business
of
accepting
wagers.
just
like
anyone
else
considering
going
into
a
business,
he
has
to
decide
for
himself
whether
he's
going
into
the
particular
business
and
accept
the
conditions
that
are
attached
by
government
to
engaging
them.
the
time
that
this
choice
has
made
he
knows
that
if
he
decides
to
accept
wagers,
he
will
be
required
to
comply
with
the
federal
wagering
tax
laws.
there
was
a
grace
period
at
the
beginning
of
the
statute
when
it
was
enacted.
and
indeed
a
lot
of
people
for
a
time
get
out
of
the
waging
business
because
of
the
thing,
because
of
the
federal
tax.
i
think
most
of
them
have
probably
gotten
back
in.
so
viewed,
the
requirements
of
those
laws
including
registration
and
payment
of
the
occupational
tax
are
under
kahriger
and
lewis,
known
conditions
to
the
voluntary
act
of
engaging
in
the
business
and
this
i
should
add
was
a
construction
given
by
judge
friendly
in
the
opinion
below
to
this
court's
decisions
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
the
court
stated
in
kahriger,
that
a
perspective
gambler
as
merely
informed
by
the
statute,
“that
in
order
to
engage
in
a
business
of
wagering
in
the
future,
he
must
fulfill
certain
conditions.”
in
lewis,
the
court
said
if
petitioner
desires
to
engage
in
an
unlawful
business,
he
does
so
only
on
his
own
volition.
the
fact
that
he
may
elect
to
pay
the
tax
and
make
the
prescribed
disclosures
required
by
the
act
is
a
matter
of
choice.
there's
nothing
compulsory
about
it
and
consequently,
there's
nothing
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
only
compulsion
under
the
act
is
that
requiring
a
decision
which
would
be
gamblers
must
make
at
the
threshold.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
problem
that
these
people
say
they
have
is
that
gambling
is
illegal
and
they
have
to
make
an
unconscionable
choice
between
incriminating
themselves
if
they
comply
with
the
federal
law
or
getting
themselves
into
criminal
difficulty
if
they
don't
comply.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
teacher
situation,
you
don't
have
that.
that
teaching
isn't
illegal.
and
whether
one
deciding
to
go
into
teaching
accepts
certain
of
the
incidents
of
that
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
is
a
different
question
whether
someone
in
a
business
regulated
in
tax
by
the
government
accepts
those
conditions,
they're
not
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
but
he's
got
a
chance
to
decide
whether
he
wants
to
engage
in
gambling
or
not
and
this
is
one
of
the
conditions
that
government
attaches
to
it.
that's
the
substance
of
the
point.
petitioner
doesn't
say
that
anyone
forced
into
engaging
in
gambling
and
in
our
view
is
voluntary
decision
to
do
so
results
in
his
being
required
to
register
and
pay
the
tax,
whether
in
our
view
petitioner
really
seeks
as
a
protective
status
for
his
business
because
of
its
illegality
that
in
our
view
is
not
required
by
the
fifth
amendment.
now
getting
to
albertson,
we
feel
that
albertson
can
be
reconciled
with
this
analysis
that
are
stated
here
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
now
we
realized
that
it
could
be
said
that
communist
party
members
had
a
period
within
which
they
could
get
out
of
the
party.
and
thus
to
that
extent
had
a
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
subject
themselves
to
registration.
but
under
the
facts
of
albertson
it's
clear
that
the
petitioners
there
had
no
choice.
specific
orders
of
the
board
required
them
to
register.
in
addition,
communist
party
membership
without
knowledge
of
its
unlawful
purposes
or
intent
to
further
them
as
constitutionally
protected
under
the
first
amendment
so
that
the
compelling
registration
might
have
the
effect
of
deterring
lawful
association.
we
can
perceive
no
such
countervailing
constitutional
interest
involved
whether
disclosure
pertains
not
to
speech
or
association
with
engagement
in
gambling.
moreover
here,
the
wagering
tax
registration
requirement
as
we
developed
in
our
brief
serves
a
valid
governmental
interest,
incident
to
the
exercise
of
a
power
separate
and
independent,
power
to
tax,
separate
and
independent
for
many
specific
interest
in
the
underlying
activity
whether
it's
legal
or
illegal.
registration
requirement
in
kahriger
is
characterized
as
directly
and
intimately
related
to
the
collection
of
the
tax
and
is
obviously
supportable
in
--
as
an
aid
of
a
revenue
purpose.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
valid
purpose
serves
to
distinguish
it
from
the
registration
provision
involved
in
albertson.
that
provision
as
the
court
pointed
out,
particularly
in
light
of
the
board's
determination
serve
little
purpose
other
than
to
require
the
revelation
of
incriminating
information
directly
toward
regulating
the
very
activity
which
the
registrants
were
required
to
admit
activity
in
subversive
organizations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
narcotics
laws
in
the
registration
of
the
tax
provisions
and
related
provisions
have
been
upheld
in
several
cases
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
by
this
court.
in
the
sense
that
narcotics
--
engagement
in
narcotics
is
recognized
as
a
business,
i
don't
think
it
has
all
of
the
similar
indicia
to
businesses
that
gambling
is
--
has
obtained.
but
not
--
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
infer
that
but
i
think
that
similar
questions
can
be
raised
about
the
scope
of
the
congressional
power
to
--
pursuant
to
the
tax
power
to
assess
such
things.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
not
that
i
know
of.
there
are
of
course
legal
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
way
to
characterize
the
congressional
activity.
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
nobody's
interfering
with
the
state
control.
these
are
narcotics
or
gambling
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
you
come
very
close
to
saying
your
honor
that
the
state
then
can
condition
the
federal
taxing
power
by
making
illegal,
those
things
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
that
wants
to
make
a
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
conflict
between
the
federal
government
enforcing
excise
taxes
on
gambling
and
similar
activities
in
the
state
prosecuting
those
activities.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
a
difference
in
enforcing
that?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
the
--
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
possible.
there
--
in
nevada
at
least
that
permit
some
aspects
of
gambling
that
are
taxed
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
dep
--
it
seems
to
me
it
depends
on
why
he
is
claiming
the
privilege.
he
may
claim
the
privilege
for
a
variety
of
reasons
other
than
the
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
depending
on
what
he
is
doing,
he
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
he
probably
couldn't
in
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
requirement
that
congress
aid
the
states
when
it
uses
the
taxing
power.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
again,
i
don't
know
how
the
wagering
tax
is
frustrating
any
state
policies.
the
--
there
wouldn't
be
as
many
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
does
at
all.
but
the
statute
--
this
was
the
problem
that
kefauver
had.
one
provision
that's
included
in
the
statute
as
a
result
of
these
problems
was
that
the
statute
does
not
exempt
people
from
compliance
with
the
state
laws.
the
problem
that
--
the
reason
why
gambling
got
to
be
as
large
a
business
as
it
is,
is
because
of
the
failure
of
the
enforcement
of
state
laws
which
outlawed
and
congress
may
have
recognized
this
when
it
enacted
this
tax.
if
the
states
weren't
going
to
enforce
the
laws,
at
least
we
ought
to
try
to
get
some
revenue
out
of
these
people.
and
that's
what
the
statute
is
about.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
sir,
but
that
means
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
speaks
to
the
purpose.
it
speaks
to
the
either
ineffective
enforcement
or
difficulty
of
enforcement
or
impossibility
of
the
enforcement.
that
the
thing
hasn't
worked
out
in
all
candor
to
produce
much
in
a
way
of
revenue,
we
don't
argue
that
it
does.
effectively
properly
enforced,
i
don't
know.
one
of
the
problems
they
had
right
at
the
beginning
of
this
thing
was
that
after
it
was
enacted,
an
appropriation
was
requested
to
provide
additional
agents
to
the
internal
revenue
service
to
enforce
it.
congress
refused
to
do
this.
and
the
internal
revenue
service
was
limited
in
the
amount
of
funds
and
resources
allocable
to
attempting
to
collect
this
tax,
and
this
difficulty
has
continued.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
how
much
its
cost
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
getting
less
all
the
time.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
state
courts?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
far
as
their
cases
as
this
petitioner's
counsel
pointed
out,
there
are
some
cases
that
are
listed
ten
or
so
in
their
brief.
i
don't
know
personally
of
anymore
cases
and
i
don't
have
any
figures
on
how
many
have
in
fact
been
prosecuted.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
most
of
the
people
frankly
that
register
insofar
as
we
can
tell,
do
it
in
areas
in
which
they
don't
really
fear
prosecution
for
their
underlying
activities.
now,
whatever
commentary
that
is
on
law
enforcement
in
the
states,
i
don't
know.
but
where
there's
a
real
problem,
potential
state
incrimination,
most
of
them
just
don't
register.
they
go
ahead
and
operate,
don't
pay
the
tax.
run
whatever
(voice

--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
anything
i
said
would
be
injective,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
engaged
in
policing
i
suppose
in
the
sense
that
the
people
that
are
required
to
pay
the
tax
are
engaged
in
illegal
activities.
and
you're
right,
there
were
some
references
in
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
senator
long
was
looking
into
this
matter
and
there
are
some
instances
that
came
to
light
pursuant
to
those
hearings.
it
indicated
that
in
enforcing
this,
this
tax,
there
had
been
some
cooperation
between
law
enforcement
and
tax
collection
people.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
these
problems
and
the
problems
of
how
much
revenue
is
produced,
it
seems
to
me
of
primary
--
primarily
problems
with
congress
to
reassess.
so,
there
is
some
indication
there
as
you
point
out
that
some
members
of
congress
are
concerned
about
this
law
and
concerned
about
its
enforcement.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
proper
place
where
the
concerned
should
be
left
and
that
congress
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
--
no.
it
seems
to
me
(voice
overlap)
that
there're
really
two
questions.
one
has
to
do
with
the
initiation
of
the
thing,
and
the
other
it
seems
to
me
has
to
do
with
what
the
practice
and
development
under
it.
and
it
hasn't
produced
much
revenue,
and
everybody
knows
that.
the
point
that
i
was
making
was
addressed
to
the
original
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting.
it
was
a
great
bit
of
cynicism
about
it
and
i
have
the
same
cynicism
i
point
--
as
i
said
when
i
first
came
to
this
thing
and
i
was
kind
of
surprised
with
reading
the
legislative
history.
now
legislative
history
can
say
whatever
anybody
wants
it
to
say,
i
understand
that.
but
in
the
floor
debates,
either
they
hadn't
thought
about
the
thing
or
there
are
a
lot
of
naïve
people
around
because
there
are
over
and
over
indications
that
the
purpose
is
to
try
to
get
some
revenue
from
this
massive
business
that's
going
on.
if
you
can't
stop
it
at
least
we
can
get
some
money
out
of
it.
that
was
the
purpose.
now,
i
think
you
point
out
that
the
thing
as
justice
black
points
out
that
the
tax
hasn't
worked
out
to
produce
that
much
revenue.
i
don't
know
why
it
hasn't.
one
reason
to
that
is
because
that
people
aren't
registered
but
the
--
pay
the
tax.
one
problem
relates
to
enforcement
of
collection.
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
different
problem
and
the
purpose
of
congress
initially
in
enacting.
another
aspect
of
albertson
should
be
mentioned
in
passing
as
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
the
court
in
albertson
carefully
distinguished
the
sullivan
situation.
an
income
taxation
of
income
from
illegal
sources
has
been
consistently
upheld
by
this
court.
in
our
view,
sullivan
is
in
some
respects
distinguishable
here
but
it's
not
fully
in
apposite.
just
like
the
non-tax
fare
in
sullivan,
the
non-tax
fares
here
seek
to
draw,
find
your
circle
around
themselves
and
their
activities
by
simply
not
registering
and
not
paying
the
tax.
the
court
now
which
it
noted
in
discussing
sullivan
that
to
honor
the
claim
of
privilege
not
asserted
at
the
time
to
return
his
due
would
make
the
tax
pay
rather
than
in
a
tribunal,
the
final
arbiter
of
the
merits
of
the
claim.
in
albertson,
the
court
found
such
a
consideration
inapplicable
since
the
board
there
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
petition
self-incrimination
claim.
here
on
the
other
hand,
assuming
that
petitioner's
fail
to
comply
with
the
wagering
tax
laws
because
of
fear
of
incrimination
they
and
they
alone
decided
at
the
time
that
they
fail
to
comply,
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
do
so.
now
we
recognize
that
the
court
would
not
agree
to
hear
these
cases.
had
it
not
been
concerned
about
the
continuing
liability
of
kahriger
and
lewis.
and
should
the
court
disagree
with
our
analysis
with
those
cases
and
find
that
the
registration
requirement
at
least,
that
the
wagering
tax
laws
would
result
in
compelling
incriminating
information
so
as
to
bring
in
to
play
the
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment.
then
we
submit,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
entire
wagering
tax
scheme
or
even
the
registration
plan
must
necessarily
fall.
we
suggest
that
rather
than
sanctioning
a
failure
to
register
and
pay
the
taxes,
the
result
should
be
to
place
appropriate
restrictions
upon
the
use
of
the
information
obtained
as
a
result
to
compliance
with
the
wagering
tax
law.
as
long
as
the
information
of
paying
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
income
tax
return
information
is
kept
confidential
pursuant
to
statute
for
use
except
--
to
assist
other
states
in
enforcing
their
tax
laws.
such
a
rule
would
be
somewhat
similar
to
that
approach.
now,
so
long
as
the
information
of
thing
is
confined
or
used
the
aid
of
collecting
taxes,
no
problem
of
self-incrimination
arises,
because
the
privilege
protects
against
the
compulsion
by
the
government
of
information
which
can
be
used
to
convict
the
person
of
crime.
if
any
non-tax
use
of
the
information
obtained
in
connection
with
registration
is
prescribed,
used
either
by
the
states
or
by
the
federal
government,
privilege
in
our
view
would
be
accorded
full
protection.
such
an
approach
would
--
picking
up
the
footnote
to
justice
goldberg
as
we
point
in
our
brief
wrote
in
murphy
would
focus
upon
the
time
and
the
attempted
use
of
such
information
and
not
the
time
to
attempt
that
compulsion.
in
our
view,
similar
exclusionary
rules
have
been
fashioned
by
the
court
to
effectuate
fifth
amendment
rights
in
other
context.
just
such
a
rule
as
we
point
out
is
adopted
in
murphy
versus
waterfront
commission.
the
court
there
recognized
that
such
an
approach
was
appropriate
where
a
separate
and
an
independent
governmental
interest,
not
just
an
interest
in
the
underlying
activity
alone
such
as
now
which
someone
is
involved.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
your
honor,
we're
suggesting
that
in
the
circumstances
here,
if
kahriger
and
lewis
are
found
no
longer
to
be
good
law
that
the
court
rather
than
strike
down
the
wagering
tax
should
indicate
and
adopt
and
that
it
--
a
use
restriction
or
an
exclusionary
rule
with
respect
to
any
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
would
protect
individuals
required
to
comply
against
any
of
interest
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
--
we're
not
arguing
that
the
rule
that
we
suggest
be
one
of
immunity.
we're
suggesting
a
little
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
may
in
some
circumstances
amount
to
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
approach
these
lengths.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
such
as
was
stated
in
murphy,
the
burden
of
proof
on
showing
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
congress
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
congress
could
prevail
in
various
ways.
if
congress
acted
in
that
manner,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
take
the
ground
out
from
under
a
decision
such
as
we
suggested
which
he
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
you
would
be
left
with
the
situation
in
which
the
court
presumably
since
it
got
to
adoption
of
such
a
rule,
would
have
found
on
any
other
basis
the
wagering
tax
scheme
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
would
be
the
situation
that
then
would
exist.
it
seems
to
me
you
mentioned
deferral
to
congress.
there
are
several
options
that
are
open
here.
one
is
to
--
if
there
are
serious
fifth
amendment
problems,
strike
down
the
statute,
leave
it
up
to
congress
to
reenact
such
a
statute
and
provide
effective
protection
along
the
lines
suggested.
the
other,
the
one
that
we
suggest
is
to
uphold
the
statute
and
if
you
find
fifth
amendment
problems
to
adopt
the
rule
that
would
protect
against
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
a
constitutional
rule
just
as
the
rule
in
murphy
which
stated
to
be
a
constitutional
rule.
murphy
--
the
court
in
murphy
said,
we
hold
the
constitutional
rule
to
be
that
a
state
witness
may
not
be
compelled
to
give
testimony
which
maybe
incriminating
under
federal
law
unless
the
compelled
testimony
and
it's
fruits
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
by
federal
officials
in
connection
with
the
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
continuing,
we
conclude
moreover
that
an
order
to
implement
this
constitutional
rule
and
accommodate
the
interest
of
the
state
and
federal
governments
in
investigating
the
prosecuting
crime,
the
federal
government
must
be
prohibited
in
making
any
such
use
of
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
if
you
adopted
the
rule
like
this,
it's
clear
that
the
federal
government
can
no
longer
make
available
any
information.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
our
understanding
of
how
we
would
comply
with
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i'm
just
speaking
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
for
use
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decision
the
other
day
in
the
garrity
case,
that's
essentially
what
the
court
held.
it
had
a
situation
in
which
he'd
found
that
information
that
had
been
compelled
had
been
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution
reversed
on
that
ground.
it
stated
that's
the
holding.
it
said
there,
could
not
use
that
to
convict
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
see
any
substantial
difference
in
the
way
that
such
a
rule
would
work
in
practice.
like
an
exclusionary
rule
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
context,
the
case
comes
up,
the
information
has
been
used,
it
was
sought
to
be
excluded,
the
court
allowed
it
and
the
question
is
whether
it
was
properly
allowed
or
not.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you're
right
and
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
so
long
as
the
information,
the
disclosure
that
was
compelled
produced
a
lead
that
was
used
in
connection
with
the
prosecution.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i
understand
that
the
point
that
you're
making
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
a
situation
in
which
you
couldn't
show
any
use
of
information
that
had
been
compelled
but
you
could
show
that
the
fact
of
registration
was
related
to
the
fact
of
subsequent
prosecution.
that
would
present
a
question
at
that
time
that's
relevant
to
the
scope
of
determining
the
privilege
and
now
--
which
we
would
offer.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
the
concept
of
a
lead
relates
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
they're
difficult
question
that
are
hard
to
talk
about
except
in
concrete
situation
as
to
--
and
this
court,
i
think
the
doctrines
are
still
evolving
and
developing
concepts
of
attenuation,
independent
source
and
whatever.
but
i
perceived
the
point
that
you
make
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
situation
would
not
simply
be
a
use
situation
but
it
properly
characterized
as
it
--
as
an
investigatory
lead,
than
the
rule
would
offer.
since
my
time
is
short
i'll
just
state
with
respect
to
the
disposition
if
kahriger
and
lewis
are
upheld,
we
feel
that
affirmance
of
the
second
circuit's
decision
here
is
clearly
appropriate.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
us
a
more
difficult
question
is
presented.
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
respect
to
kahriger
and
lewis
and
adopt
the
use
restriction
rule
such
as
we
suggest.
we
recognized
it
in
murphy,
the
court
reversed
the
contempt
convictions
and
remanded
the
case
in
order
to
provide
the
individuals
with
an
opportunity
to
testify.
we
think
however
that
there
are
different
circumstances
that
exist
here,
it
may
still
even
in
that
event
weren't
reversed.
petitioner
certainly
wasn't
surprised
here
that
he
was
required
to
comply
with
the
federal
wagering
tax
law.
kahriger
and
lewis
had
been
decided,
it's
not
in
the
situation
of
the
individual
in
james
where
the
court
held
it
wouldn't
be
fair
to
require
him
to
comply
with
the
--
in
the
same
case,
comply
with
the
change
in
the
law.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
relevant
to
petitioner
here
upon
being
arrested,
frankly
admitted
knowledge
of
the
stamp
tax
requirement,
said
that
nobody
buys
them,
that
he
pays
the
amount.
it
seems
to
us
that
under
such
circumstances,
the
petitioner
was
properly
convicted
of
violations
charged
and
we
respectfully
submit
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
government's
view
what
this
in
the
related
cases
really
involved
is
whether
gamblers
can
refuse
to
pay
a
tax
because
the
business
--
their
engagement
is
illegal.
petitioner
in
this
case
as
has
been
pointed
out
was
convicted
for
failing
to
register
as
required
under
the
federal
wagering
tax
laws
and
also
for
failure
to
pay
the
special
occupational
tax,
$50
tax,
on
those
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers.
on
the
companion
grosso
case
which
we'll
be
argued
subsequently,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
for
failure
to
pay
the
10%
excise
tax
on
grocery
receipts
from
wagering.
i
don't
think
that
i
have
to
deal
at
length
with
the
fact
that
professional
gambling
is
one
of
the
largest
business
enterprises
in
this
country.
and
although
gamblers
gross
many
billions
of
dollars
per
year,
it's
common
knowledge
that
they
pay
very
little
on
taxes.
now,
they're
of
course
--
they
are
of
course
subject
to
income
taxation
but
obviously
collection
is
very
difficult
because
of
the
nature
of
their
operations.
unlike
many
other
businesses,
gambling
has
been
subjected
by
congress
to
an
excise
tax,
a
wagering
tax
that's
here
at
issue.
this
tax
as
the
court
well
knows
was
upheld
by
this
court
over
constitutional
attack
in
the
kahriger
and
lewis
cases
decided
in
1953
and
1955.
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case,
limited
to
the
question
whether
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
last
term,
in
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board,
kahriger
and
lewis
should
be
overruled.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
for
the
reference
i
think
in
the
grant
was
to
kahriger
and
lewis
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
in
our
view,
those
cases
properly
considered
and
properly
construed
are
still
good
law.
should
the
court
disagree
however
and
find
merit
in
petitioner's
fifth
amendment
contentions
we
suggest
that
the
appropriate
result
here
would
be
to
uphold
the
wagering
tax
laws
while
adopting
a
rule
prohibiting
the
use
of
any
information
disclosed
as
a
result
of
compliance
with
those
laws,
in
any
subsequent
criminal
prosecution.
before
discussing
kahriger
and
lewis
in
the
context
of
albertson,
which
is
of
course
the
central
issue
here,
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
on
our
view
of
the
substance
of
the
constitutional
claim
asserted
by
petitioners
in
this
--
in
the
related
cases.
they
don't
deny
that
they're
gamblers.
indeed,
that's
essential
to
their
constitutional
contention.
they
don't
assert
that
the
wagering
tax
is
not
a
tax
major,
they
slap
at
it
occasionally.
such
a
position,
i
think
they
recognize
would
fly
squarely
in
the
face
of
this
court's
limited
grant
of
certiorari.
and
they
don't
deny
that
under
the
wagering
tax
laws,
they
were
required
to
register
as
being
engaged
in
the
business
for
accepting
wagers
and
we're
required
to
pay
the
prescribed
taxes.
what
they
say
however
is
this.
they
say
that
they're
excused
from
compliance
with
the
wagering
tax
laws
because
of
the
fifth
amendment.
since
gambling
is
illegal
under
the
laws
of
most
states,
compliance
with
the
wagering
tax
laws
they
assert
would
require
them
to
incriminate
themselves.
this
they
say
they
can't
be
compelled
to
do,
since
the
fifth
amendment's
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
now
under
this
court's
decision
in
malloy
versus
hogan
fully
applicable
to
the
states.
in
petitioner's
view
in
short,
state
law
has
the
effect
of
limiting
the
federal
tax
problem.
thus
they
conclude
they
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
failure
to
register,
file
a
return
to
pay
the
taxes.
as
against
the
statutory
requirements,
what
they
essentially
assert
is
the
right
to
remain
silent
or
right
to
go
on
with
their
business
in
privacy.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
doubt
it
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
engagement
in
that
activity
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
an
ongoing,
continuing
sort
of
business
in
the
same
sense
that
gambling
is.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
reiken
(ph)
case
and
mr.
justice
black
said
in
the
dissent
there
that
gambling
and
activities
like
that
are
recognized,
it's
ongoing
businesses
whereas
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
those
questions
are
difficult
and
have
to
--
would
have
to
be
resolved
with
respect
to
each
individual
situation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
more
because
of
the
limitations
on
the
federal
tax
power
and
in
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
the
purpose
is
to
put
an
end
to
the
narcotics
trade
and
not
to
obtain
revenue,
then
a
question
is
raised
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
by
congress
of
the
powers
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
with
all
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
with
all
deference
your
honor,
when
i
first
get
involved
in
looking
into
these
cases,
i
had
the
same
attitude
that
you
have.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
this
thing,
and
the
one
at
the
background
of
its
enactment,
there
really
were
people
in
congress
that
thought
it
was
going
to
provide
revenue
and
they
were
concerned
about
the
problem
of
gambling
being
increasingly
large
enterprise
that
didn't
pay
a
substantial
amount
of
taxes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
one
of
the
reasons
for
asking
about
employees
is
that
the
employers
are
supposed
to
have
a
stamp
also.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
in
all
candor
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
there
are
similar
laws
that
relate
to
people
in
the
narcotics
business.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
depends
your
honor
on
an
assessment
of
the
business-like
nature
of
what's
going
on
here,
whether
it's
legal
or
illegal.
i
think
all
of
these
taxes
are
close
to
the
borderline
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
the
exercised
power
by
congress.
and
the
--
that
the
prior
cases
on
taxes
like
this
have
involved
this
court's
opinions,
have
involved
the
discussion
of
this
consideration.
some
deference
i
think
must
be
given
to
the
congressional
judgment,
that
the
matter
is
an
appropriate
one
to
tax.
now
the
farther
away
you
get
it
seems
to
me
from
a
legitimate
business
activity
or
business
activity
that
goes
on
a
substantial
proportion
so
that
congress
could
make
a
judgment
that
it
would
produce
some
revenue,
the
more
questionable
the
exercise
gets.
and
at
some
point,
i
suppose
that
the
power
as
you
serve.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
--
well,
the
--
simply
could
impose
it.
i
think
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
collect
the
tax.
the
purpose
of
registration
which
is
a
fairly
common
provision
in
most
excised
tax
situations
is
to
assist
the
government
in
identifying
the
people
that
are
required
to
pay
the
tax,
so
as
to
assist
in
the
enforcement
of
it.
if
there
was
no
registration
requirement
here,
but
there
was
a
tax,
it
seems
to
me
that
some
taxes
still
continue
to
be
collected
but
enforcement
would
be
made
more
difficult.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
you
assume
that
the
government
can
collect
the
tax
and
require
compliance
with
the
tax
laws
which
won't
in
any
sense
run
afoul
with
the
fifth
amendment
then
i
think
there's
a
difference.
but
if
you
say
that
the
registration
provision
causes
serious
fifth
amendment
problems
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
serious
fifth
amendment
problems,
then
--
problems
of
incrimination.
you
can
make
distinction
but
i
think
that
it's
--
i
think
it
somewhat
difficult
to
make
distinctions
which
would
uphold
the
power
to
tax
without
allowing
congress
to
impose
reasonable
incidence
to
the
exercise
of
that
power
such
as
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
the
sullivan
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
the
sullivan
case?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
holding
of
sullivan
is
--
as
we
view
it
simply
that
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
excuse
one
in
failing
to
file
an
income
tax
return
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
i
see
some
differences
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
sullivan
says
is
as
we
read
it,
is
that
the
government
can
compel
a
person
to
comply
with
the
income
tax
law
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
file
a
return.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
get
to
that
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that
question
wasn't
involved
in
sullivan.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
well
the
prosecution
was
for
failure
to
file
a
return.
and
he
said
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
may
or
it
may
not
have
depending
on
--
you
know
what
this
guy
had
been
doing
there.
i
think
he
had
some
income
from
illegal
liquor
activities
as
i
recall.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
part
of
the
law
that
we
have
here,
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
aspect
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i
think
that
--
that's
a
distinction
that
we
suggest
in
our
briefs
that
the
question
is
involved
in
the
subsequent
case
more
probably
because
that
is
the
nonpayment
situation.
before
turning
to
our
argument,
i
should
mention
as
a
--
just
refer
that
--
since
nonpayment
of
the
excise
tax
is
involved
in
the
subsequent
grosso
case,
i
shall
--
may
confine
any
further
discussion
here
to
the
non-registration,
nonpayment
of
the
occupational
tax.
i
should
add
that
registration
and
payment
of
this
occupational
tax
really
a
--
one
identical
act.
you
register,
you
file
a
return
and
pay
the
$50
at
one
time
and
get
the
stamp
back.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
what
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
now,
the
registration
form
or
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
or
the
tax
of
the
excise
tax
return
form?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
both.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
we
concede
that
the
registration
form
requires
a
greater
amount
of
potentially
incriminating
information.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
you
say
the
pervasive
effect
is
there
--
there
is
more
information
called
for
and
in
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
depends
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
the
person
that's
required
to
file
is
someone
who
under
--
in
his
state
is
engaging
in
activities
that
are
illegal,
most
of
the
questions
on
that
form
call
for
information
that
could
be
subsequently
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution
for
gambling.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
think
that
kahriger
and
lewis
properly
understood
or
are
outside
of
albertson
but
for
several
reasons
as
we
developed
in
the
briefs
and
now
developed
here.
it's
a
difficult
argument
to
make
and
obviously
we
wouldn't
have
made
the
alternative
argument
have
we
been
completely
satisfied
with
our
position.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
nobody.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
state
affirmed.
unless
they
show
that
any
information
that
was
used
came
from
a
wholly
independent
source
as
murphy
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
the
way
this
case
--
these
particular
cases
come
up,
i
don't
think
there's
a
required
records
problem
in
them.
now,
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
that's
amplified
by
regulation
that
requires
the
keeping
of
daily
wagering
records
that
are
related
to
the
excise
tax.
in
a
situation
in
which
you
had
some
of
these
records
kept
and
introduced,
you
may
have
a
shapiro
situation,
we
don't
have
it
here.
i
--
we
haven't
attempted
to
argue
that
the
returns
themselves
are
records.
there's
some
indications
at
least
in
various
opinions
that
things
that
you're
required
to
file
and
not
keep
as
a
business
matter
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
required
records
doctrine.
in
our
view
as
i
stated
kahriger
and
lewis
correctly
interpreted
provide
an
acceptable
rationale
for
decision
here
not
undermined
by
albertson.
now
one
of
the
grounds
for
decision
in
kahriger
and
mistakenly
regarded
in
our
view
by
some
as
the
sole
ground
was
that
the
registration
required
was
prospective
in
operation,
therefore
there
wasn't
any
incrimination
problem.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
your
honor.
we
do
point
out
that
the
under
the
form
now
in
used,
and
i
should
mention
because
this
question
came
up
yesterday.
the
only
reason
we
included
the
present
form
is
because
we
didn't
know
until
we'd
got
into
this
case,
they'd
revised
a
thing.
we
didn't
mean
to
intimate
at
all
that
this
form
was
available
and
should've
been
used
by
petitioners
here.
i
don't
know
what
was
available
to
them
in
connecticut
and
i'm
going
to
accept
that
the
old
form
was,
but
it
may
be
relevant
to
the
court
that
the
revised
form
is
in
certain
--
pertinent
respects
different
from
the
old.
this
form
bears
a
date
of
1963
and
was
--
and
we
requested
from
the
internal
revenue
service
in
forms
the
one
that
they
provided
to
us
is
the
one
that's
now
in
used.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
one
of
the
problems
that
was
involved
in
the
enactment
of
this
thing
was
senator
kefauver's
strong
opposition.
he
kept
pointing
this
out.
he
said,
this
is
an
ill-conceived
statute.
it's
ill-conceived
because
it
looks
like
the
federal
government
is
authorizing
or
sanctioning
in
the
engagement
in
the
business
of
gambling
and
he
opposed
it
throughout.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
his
opposition
is
relevant.
he
was
probably
the
person
at
that
time
in
the
congress,
most
knowledgeable
about
organized
gambling.
congress
enacted
this
along
with
the
whole
array
of
excise
taxes
to
provide
revenue
for
the
korean
war
problem.
and
as
i
was
discussing
with
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
all
candor,
we
--
there
are
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
more
than
a
revenue
purpose
in
mind.
but
their
indication's
the
other
way.
the
tax
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
any
studies
have
been
made
as
the
petitioner
refers
--
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
at
one
point
in
time
in
1961
stated
that
it
cost
more
to
collect
this
tax
than
the
tax
produced.
the
tax
has
produced
money.
it's
produced
a
hundred
million
dollars
in
the
15
years
of
its
operation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
one
--
about
a
hundred
million
dollars.
we
don't
stand
as
i
said
on
this
prospective
--
retrospective
distinction,
but
we
think
that
this
ground
was
neither
the
sole
nor
the
primary
one
for
decision
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
those
cases
the
registration
requirement
does
not
compel
the
individual
to
make
incriminating
disclosures
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
he
has
a
clear
and
available
choice
as
an
initial
matter
as
to
whether
they're
engaged
or
not
engaged
in
a
business
of
accepting
wagers.
just
like
anyone
else
considering
going
into
a
business,
he
has
to
decide
for
himself
whether
he's
going
into
the
particular
business
and
accept
the
conditions
that
are
attached
by
government
to
engaging
them.
the
time
that
this
choice
has
made
he
knows
that
if
he
decides
to
accept
wagers,
he
will
be
required
to
comply
with
the
federal
wagering
tax
laws.
there
was
a
grace
period
at
the
beginning
of
the
statute
when
it
was
enacted.
and
indeed
a
lot
of
people
for
a
time
get
out
of
the
waging
business
because
of
the
thing,
because
of
the
federal
tax.
i
think
most
of
them
have
probably
gotten
back
in.
so
viewed,
the
requirements
of
those
laws
including
registration
and
payment
of
the
occupational
tax
are
under
kahriger
and
lewis,
known
conditions
to
the
voluntary
act
of
engaging
in
the
business
and
this
i
should
add
was
a
construction
given
by
judge
friendly
in
the
opinion
below
to
this
court's
decisions
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
the
court
stated
in
kahriger,
that
a
perspective
gambler
as
merely
informed
by
the
statute,
“that
in
order
to
engage
in
a
business
of
wagering
in
the
future,
he
must
fulfill
certain
conditions.”
in
lewis,
the
court
said
if
petitioner
desires
to
engage
in
an
unlawful
business,
he
does
so
only
on
his
own
volition.
the
fact
that
he
may
elect
to
pay
the
tax
and
make
the
prescribed
disclosures
required
by
the
act
is
a
matter
of
choice.
there's
nothing
compulsory
about
it
and
consequently,
there's
nothing
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
only
compulsion
under
the
act
is
that
requiring
a
decision
which
would
be
gamblers
must
make
at
the
threshold.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
problem
that
these
people
say
they
have
is
that
gambling
is
illegal
and
they
have
to
make
an
unconscionable
choice
between
incriminating
themselves
if
they
comply
with
the
federal
law
or
getting
themselves
into
criminal
difficulty
if
they
don't
comply.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
teacher
situation,
you
don't
have
that.
that
teaching
isn't
illegal.
and
whether
one
deciding
to
go
into
teaching
accepts
certain
of
the
incidents
of
that
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
is
a
different
question
whether
someone
in
a
business
regulated
in
tax
by
the
government
accepts
those
conditions,
they're
not
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
but
he's
got
a
chance
to
decide
whether
he
wants
to
engage
in
gambling
or
not
and
this
is
one
of
the
conditions
that
government
attaches
to
it.
that's
the
substance
of
the
point.
petitioner
doesn't
say
that
anyone
forced
into
engaging
in
gambling
and
in
our
view
is
voluntary
decision
to
do
so
results
in
his
being
required
to
register
and
pay
the
tax,
whether
in
our
view
petitioner
really
seeks
as
a
protective
status
for
his
business
because
of
its
illegality
that
in
our
view
is
not
required
by
the
fifth
amendment.
now
getting
to
albertson,
we
feel
that
albertson
can
be
reconciled
with
this
analysis
that
are
stated
here
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
now
we
realized
that
it
could
be
said
that
communist
party
members
had
a
period
within
which
they
could
get
out
of
the
party.
and
thus
to
that
extent
had
a
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
subject
themselves
to
registration.
but
under
the
facts
of
albertson
it's
clear
that
the
petitioners
there
had
no
choice.
specific
orders
of
the
board
required
them
to
register.
in
addition,
communist
party
membership
without
knowledge
of
its
unlawful
purposes
or
intent
to
further
them
as
constitutionally
protected
under
the
first
amendment
so
that
the
compelling
registration
might
have
the
effect
of
deterring
lawful
association.
we
can
perceive
no
such
countervailing
constitutional
interest
involved
whether
disclosure
pertains
not
to
speech
or
association
with
engagement
in
gambling.
moreover
here,
the
wagering
tax
registration
requirement
as
we
developed
in
our
brief
serves
a
valid
governmental
interest,
incident
to
the
exercise
of
a
power
separate
and
independent,
power
to
tax,
separate
and
independent
for
many
specific
interest
in
the
underlying
activity
whether
it's
legal
or
illegal.
registration
requirement
in
kahriger
is
characterized
as
directly
and
intimately
related
to
the
collection
of
the
tax
and
is
obviously
supportable
in
--
as
an
aid
of
a
revenue
purpose.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
valid
purpose
serves
to
distinguish
it
from
the
registration
provision
involved
in
albertson.
that
provision
as
the
court
pointed
out,
particularly
in
light
of
the
board's
determination
serve
little
purpose
other
than
to
require
the
revelation
of
incriminating
information
directly
toward
regulating
the
very
activity
which
the
registrants
were
required
to
admit
activity
in
subversive
organizations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
narcotics
laws
in
the
registration
of
the
tax
provisions
and
related
provisions
have
been
upheld
in
several
cases
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
by
this
court.
in
the
sense
that
narcotics
--
engagement
in
narcotics
is
recognized
as
a
business,
i
don't
think
it
has
all
of
the
similar
indicia
to
businesses
that
gambling
is
--
has
obtained.
but
not
--
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
infer
that
but
i
think
that
similar
questions
can
be
raised
about
the
scope
of
the
congressional
power
to
--
pursuant
to
the
tax
power
to
assess
such
things.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
not
that
i
know
of.
there
are
of
course
legal
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
way
to
characterize
the
congressional
activity.
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
nobody's
interfering
with
the
state
control.
these
are
narcotics
or
gambling
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
you
come
very
close
to
saying
your
honor
that
the
state
then
can
condition
the
federal
taxing
power
by
making
illegal,
those
things
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
that
wants
to
make
a
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
conflict
between
the
federal
government
enforcing
excise
taxes
on
gambling
and
similar
activities
in
the
state
prosecuting
those
activities.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
a
difference
in
enforcing
that?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
the
--
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
possible.
there
--
in
nevada
at
least
that
permit
some
aspects
of
gambling
that
are
taxed
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
dep
--
it
seems
to
me
it
depends
on
why
he
is
claiming
the
privilege.
he
may
claim
the
privilege
for
a
variety
of
reasons
other
than
the
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
depending
on
what
he
is
doing,
he
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
he
probably
couldn't
in
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
requirement
that
congress
aid
the
states
when
it
uses
the
taxing
power.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
again,
i
don't
know
how
the
wagering
tax
is
frustrating
any
state
policies.
the
--
there
wouldn't
be
as
many
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis

beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
does
at
all.
but
the
statute
--
this
was
the
problem
that
kefauver
had.
one
provision
that's
included
in
the
statute
as
a
result
of
these
problems
was
that
the
statute
does
not
exempt
people
from
compliance
with
the
state
laws.
the
problem
that
--
the
reason
why
gambling
got
to
be
as
large
a
business
as
it
is,
is
because
of
the
failure
of
the
enforcement
of
state
laws
which
outlawed
and
congress
may
have
recognized
this
when
it
enacted
this
tax.
if
the
states
weren't
going
to
enforce
the
laws,
at
least
we
ought
to
try
to
get
some
revenue
out
of
these
people.
and
that's
what
the
statute
is
about.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
sir,
but
that
means
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
speaks
to
the
purpose.
it
speaks
to
the
either
ineffective
enforcement
or
difficulty
of
enforcement
or
impossibility
of
the
enforcement.
that
the
thing
hasn't
worked
out
in
all
candor
to
produce
much
in
a
way
of
revenue,
we
don't
argue
that
it
does.
effectively
properly
enforced,
i
don't
know.
one
of
the
problems
they
had
right
at
the
beginning
of
this
thing
was
that
after
it
was
enacted,
an
appropriation
was
requested
to
provide
additional
agents
to
the
internal
revenue
service
to
enforce
it.
congress
refused
to
do
this.
and
the
internal
revenue
service
was
limited
in
the
amount
of
funds
and
resources
allocable
to
attempting
to
collect
this
tax,
and
this
difficulty
has
continued.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
how
much
its
cost
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
getting
less
all
the
time.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
state
courts?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
far
as
their
cases
as
this
petitioner's
counsel
pointed
out,
there
are
some
cases
that
are
listed
ten
or
so
in
their
brief.
i
don't
know
personally
of
anymore
cases
and
i
don't
have
any
figures
on
how
many
have
in
fact
been
prosecuted.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
most
of
the
people
frankly
that
register
insofar
as
we
can
tell,
do
it
in
areas
in
which
they
don't
really
fear
prosecution
for
their
underlying
activities.
now,
whatever
commentary
that
is
on
law
enforcement
in
the
states,
i
don't
know.
but
where
there's
a
real
problem,
potential
state
incrimination,
most
of
them
just
don't
register.
they
go
ahead
and
operate,
don't
pay
the
tax.
run
whatever
(voice

--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
anything
i
said
would
be
injective,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
engaged
in
policing
i
suppose
in
the
sense
that
the
people
that
are
required
to
pay
the
tax
are
engaged
in
illegal
activities.
and
you're
right,
there
were
some
references
in
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
senator
long
was
looking
into
this
matter
and
there
are
some
instances
that
came
to
light
pursuant
to
those
hearings.
it
indicated
that
in
enforcing
this,
this
tax,
there
had
been
some
cooperation
between
law
enforcement
and
tax
collection
people.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
these
problems
and
the
problems
of
how
much
revenue
is
produced,
it
seems
to
me
of
primary
--
primarily
problems
with
congress
to
reassess.
so,
there
is
some
indication
there
as
you
point
out
that
some
members
of
congress
are
concerned
about
this
law
and
concerned
about
its
enforcement.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
proper
place
where
the
concerned
should
be
left
and
that
congress
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it's
--
no.
it
seems
to
me
(voice
overlap)
that
there're
really
two
questions.
one
has
to
do
with
the
initiation
of
the
thing,
and
the
other
it
seems
to
me
has
to
do
with
what
the
practice
and
development
under
it.
and
it
hasn't
produced
much
revenue,
and
everybody
knows
that.
the
point
that
i
was
making
was
addressed
to
the
original
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting.
it
was
a
great
bit
of
cynicism
about
it
and
i
have
the
same
cynicism
i
point
--
as
i
said
when
i
first
came
to
this
thing
and
i
was
kind
of
surprised
with
reading
the
legislative
history.
now
legislative
history
can
say
whatever
anybody
wants
it
to
say,
i
understand
that.
but
in
the
floor
debates,
either
they
hadn't
thought
about
the
thing
or
there
are
a
lot
of
naïve
people
around
because
there
are
over
and
over
indications
that
the
purpose
is
to
try
to
get
some
revenue
from
this
massive
business
that's
going
on.
if
you
can't
stop
it
at
least
we
can
get
some
money
out
of
it.
that
was
the
purpose.
now,
i
think
you
point
out
that
the
thing
as
justice
black
points
out
that
the
tax
hasn't
worked
out
to
produce
that
much
revenue.
i
don't
know
why
it
hasn't.
one
reason
to
that
is
because
that
people
aren't
registered
but
the
--
pay
the
tax.
one
problem
relates
to
enforcement
of
collection.
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
different
problem
and
the
purpose
of
congress
initially
in
enacting.
another
aspect
of
albertson
should
be
mentioned
in
passing
as
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
the
court
in
albertson
carefully
distinguished
the
sullivan
situation.
an
income
taxation
of
income
from
illegal
sources
has
been
consistently
upheld
by
this
court.
in
our
view,
sullivan
is
in
some
respects
distinguishable
here
but
it's
not
fully
in
apposite.
just
like
the
non-tax
fare
in
sullivan,
the
non-tax
fares
here
seek
to
draw,
find
your
circle
around
themselves
and
their
activities
by
simply
not
registering
and
not
paying
the
tax.
the
court
now
which
it
noted
in
discussing
sullivan
that
to
honor
the
claim
of
privilege
not
asserted
at
the
time
to
return
his
due
would
make
the
tax
pay
rather
than
in
a
tribunal,
the
final
arbiter
of
the
merits
of
the
claim.
in
albertson,
the
court
found
such
a
consideration
inapplicable
since
the
board
there
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
petition
self-incrimination
claim.
here
on
the
other
hand,
assuming
that
petitioner's
fail
to
comply
with
the
wagering
tax
laws
because
of
fear
of
incrimination
they
and
they
alone
decided
at
the
time
that
they
fail
to
comply,
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
do
so.
now
we
recognize
that
the
court
would
not
agree
to
hear
these
cases.
had
it
not
been
concerned
about
the
continuing
liability
of
kahriger
and
lewis.
and
should
the
court
disagree
with
our
analysis
with
those
cases
and
find
that
the
registration
requirement
at
least,
that
the
wagering
tax
laws
would
result
in
compelling
incriminating
information
so
as
to
bring
in
to
play
the
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment.
then
we
submit,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
entire
wagering
tax
scheme
or
even
the
registration
plan
must
necessarily
fall.
we
suggest
that
rather
than
sanctioning
a
failure
to
register
and
pay
the
taxes,
the
result
should
be
to
place
appropriate
restrictions
upon
the
use
of
the
information
obtained
as
a
result
to
compliance
with
the
wagering
tax
law.
as
long
as
the
information
of
paying
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
income
tax
return
information
is
kept
confidential
pursuant
to
statute
for
use
except
--
to
assist
other
states
in
enforcing
their
tax
laws.
such
a
rule
would
be
somewhat
similar
to
that
approach.
now,
so
long
as
the
information
of
thing
is
confined
or
used
the
aid
of
collecting
taxes,
no
problem
of
self-incrimination
arises,
because
the
privilege
protects
against
the
compulsion
by
the
government
of
information
which
can
be
used
to
convict
the
person
of
crime.
if
any
non-tax
use
of
the
information
obtained
in
connection
with
registration
is
prescribed,
used
either
by
the
states
or
by
the
federal
government,
privilege
in
our
view
would
be
accorded
full
protection.
such
an
approach
would
--
picking
up
the
footnote
to
justice
goldberg
as
we
point
in
our
brief
wrote
in
murphy
would
focus
upon
the
time
and
the
attempted
use
of
such
information
and
not
the
time
to
attempt
that
compulsion.
in
our
view,
similar
exclusionary
rules
have
been
fashioned
by
the
court
to
effectuate
fifth
amendment
rights
in
other
context.
just
such
a
rule
as
we
point
out
is
adopted
in
murphy
versus
waterfront
commission.
the
court
there
recognized
that
such
an
approach
was
appropriate
where
a
separate
and
an
independent
governmental
interest,
not
just
an
interest
in
the
underlying
activity
alone
such
as
now
which
someone
is
involved.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
your
honor,
we're
suggesting
that
in
the
circumstances
here,
if
kahriger
and
lewis
are
found
no
longer
to
be
good
law
that
the
court
rather
than
strike
down
the
wagering
tax
should
indicate
and
adopt
and
that
it
--
a
use
restriction
or
an
exclusionary
rule
with
respect
to
any
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
would
protect
individuals
required
to
comply
against
any
of
interest
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
--
we're
not
arguing
that
the
rule
that
we
suggest
be
one
of
immunity.
we're
suggesting
a
little
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
may
in
some
circumstances
amount
to
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
approach
these
lengths.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
such
as
was
stated
in
murphy,
the
burden
of
proof
on
showing
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
congress
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
congress
could
prevail
in
various
ways.
if
congress
acted
in
that
manner,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
take
the
ground
out
from
under
a
decision
such
as
we
suggested
which
he
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
you
would
be
left
with
the
situation
in
which
the
court
presumably
since
it
got
to
adoption
of
such
a
rule,
would
have
found
on
any
other
basis
the
wagering
tax
scheme
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
would
be
the
situation
that
then
would
exist.
it
seems
to
me
you
mentioned
deferral
to
congress.
there
are
several
options
that
are
open
here.
one
is
to
--
if
there
are
serious
fifth
amendment
problems,
strike
down
the
statute,
leave
it
up
to
congress
to
reenact
such
a
statute
and
provide
effective
protection
along
the
lines
suggested.
the
other,
the
one
that
we
suggest
is
to
uphold
the
statute
and
if
you
find
fifth
amendment
problems
to
adopt
the
rule
that
would
protect
against
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
a
constitutional
rule
just
as
the
rule
in
murphy
which
stated
to
be
a
constitutional
rule.
murphy
--
the
court
in
murphy
said,
we
hold
the
constitutional
rule
to
be
that
a
state
witness
may
not
be
compelled
to
give
testimony
which
maybe
incriminating
under
federal
law
unless
the
compelled
testimony
and
it's
fruits
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
by
federal
officials
in
connection
with
the
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
continuing,
we
conclude
moreover
that
an
order
to
implement
this
constitutional
rule
and
accommodate
the
interest
of
the
state
and
federal
governments
in
investigating
the
prosecuting
crime,
the
federal
government
must
be
prohibited
in
making
any
such
use
of
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
if
you
adopted
the
rule
like
this,
it's
clear
that
the
federal
government
can
no
longer
make
available
any
information.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
our
understanding
of
how
we
would
comply
with
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i'm
just
speaking
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
for
use
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decision
the
other
day
in
the
garrity
case,
that's
essentially
what
the
court
held.
it
had
a
situation
in
which
he'd
found
that
information
that
had
been
compelled
had
been
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution
reversed
on
that
ground.
it
stated
that's
the
holding.
it
said
there,
could
not
use
that
to
convict
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
see
any
substantial
difference
in
the
way
that
such
a
rule
would
work
in
practice.
like
an
exclusionary
rule
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
context,
the
case
comes
up,
the
information
has
been
used,
it
was
sought
to
be
excluded,
the
court
allowed
it
and
the
question
is
whether
it
was
properly
allowed
or
not.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you're
right
and
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
so
long
as
the
information,
the
disclosure
that
was
compelled
produced
a
lead
that
was
used
in
connection
with
the
prosecution.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i
understand
that
the
point
that
you're
making
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
a
situation
in
which
you
couldn't
show
any
use
of
information
that
had
been
compelled
but
you
could
show
that
the
fact
of
registration
was
related
to
the
fact
of
subsequent
prosecution.
that
would
present
a
question
at
that
time
that's
relevant
to
the
scope
of
determining
the
privilege
and
now
--
which
we
would
offer.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
the
concept
of
a
lead
relates
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
they're
difficult
question
that
are
hard
to
talk
about
except
in
concrete
situation
as
to
--
and
this
court,
i
think
the
doctrines
are
still
evolving
and
developing
concepts
of
attenuation,
independent
source
and
whatever.
but
i
perceived
the
point
that
you
make
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
situation
would
not
simply
be
a
use
situation
but
it
properly
characterized
as
it
--
as
an
investigatory
lead,
than
the
rule
would
offer.
since
my
time
is
short
i'll
just
state
with
respect
to
the
disposition
if
kahriger
and
lewis
are
upheld,
we
feel
that
affirmance
of
the
second
circuit's
decision
here
is
clearly
appropriate.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
us
a
more
difficult
question
is
presented.
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
respect
to
kahriger
and
lewis
and
adopt
the
use
restriction
rule
such
as
we
suggest.
we
recognized
it
in
murphy,
the
court
reversed
the
contempt
convictions
and
remanded
the
case
in
order
to
provide
the
individuals
with
an
opportunity
to
testify.
we
think
however
that
there
are
different
circumstances
that
exist
here,
it
may
still
even
in
that
event
weren't
reversed.
petitioner
certainly
wasn't
surprised
here
that
he
was
required
to
comply
with
the
federal
wagering
tax
law.
kahriger
and
lewis
had
been
decided,
it's
not
in
the
situation
of
the
individual
in
james
where
the
court
held
it
wouldn't
be
fair
to
require
him
to
comply
with
the
--
in
the
same
case,
comply
with
the
change
in
the
law.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
relevant
to
petitioner
here
upon
being
arrested,
frankly
admitted
knowledge
of
the
stamp
tax
requirement,
said
that
nobody
buys
them,
that
he
pays
the
amount.
it
seems
to
us
that
under
such
circumstances,
the
petitioner
was
properly
convicted
of
