mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
faces
a
one
year
prison
sentence
and
a
$10,000
fine
for
failure
to
purchase
a
$50
wagering
tax
stamp
and
for
failure
to
register
as
one
engaged
in
the
business
of
gambling.
this
case
presents
for
reevaluation
against
fifth
amendment
objection,
the
constitutionality
of
the
wagering
tax
laws
which
this
court
upheld
in
united
state
versus
kahriger
and
in
lewis
versus
the
united
states.
petitioner
was
convicted
on
two
indictments
in
the
district
of
connecticut,
one
with
the
conspiracy
indictment
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
fail
to
pay
the
$50
tax
stamp.
the
substantive
indictment
charged
two
counts,
failure
to
pay
the
$50
tax
stamp
and
failure
to
register.
at
the
trial
level,
the
motion
which
raised
the
constitutional
issues
presented
by
this
petition
we're
denied
without
opinion
by
chief
judge
timbers
of
the
district
of
connecticut.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
resting
their
decisions
squarely
on
this
court's
decisions
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
two
weeks
after,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case,
this
court
determines
the
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board
decision.
and
on
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
in
the
court
below,
the
second
circuit
noted
that
the
albertson
case
may
have
effect
on
the
continued
validity
of
kahriger
and
lewis
but
decided
that
it
was
best
for
this
court
to
determine
what
effect
that
might
have.
the
petition
for
a
certiorari
in
this
case
was
granted
last
monday,
and
we
can
go
yesterday
and
it's
been
set
down
for
argument
at
this
time,
previously
the
issue
had
been
raised
in
costello
versus
united
states,
number
41.
but
because
of
the
death
of
costello,
this
case
was
substituted.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
my
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
these
were
codefendants
in
the
same
case.
my
issue
as
originally
filed
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
somewhat
different,
but
this
court's
order
reaffirmed
the
issue
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
exactly
as
it
was
in
costello.
so
that
the
issue
was
here
squarely
raising
the
constitutionality
of
the
wagering
tax
laws
as
originally
framed
in
the
costello
grant
of
certiorari.
there
are
also
pending,
several
other
cases
arising
out
of
the
same
series
of
grades
in
connecticut.
the
wagering
tax
statutes
involved
should
be
examined
not
as
you
--
and
not
as
individual
sections
but
perhaps
as
a
unit.
and
i
will
point
out
basically
what
the
statutes
provide.
section
4401
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
10%
excised
tax
on
anyone
engaged
in
the
business
of
gambling.
this
i
should
point
out
as
a
tax
on
gross
wagers.
section
44
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
is
in
the
next
case
grosso
against
united
states.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
feel
however
that
the
scheme
of
the
statutes
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
to
have
meaning
must
be
put
in
context.
that
section
directly
--
is
involved
for
the
first
time
in
the
next
case.
the
section
4411
which
is
directly
involved
here
is
the
provision
which
requires
the
purchase
of
$50
wagering
tax
stamp.
and
section
4412
which
is
also
directly
involved
here
is
the
section
that
requires
the
registration
in
giving
of
information
concerning
the
operation
of
the
gambling
business.
it's
appropriate
i
think
also
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
form,
form
11-c
and
supplemental
form
11-c
which
implement
section
4412.
rounding
out
the
statutory
scheme
but
not
directly
involved
as
are
4411
and
4412,
our
section
6011
which
authorizes
the
secretary
to
com
--
require
the
completion
of
forms,
such
as
form
11-c
which
i'll
go
into
more
in
detail.
and
also
there
is
section
4422
which
requires
the
payment
--
that
payment
shall
not
in
any
way
eliminate
other
penalties
which
may
be
provided.
section
4423
provides
that
books
and
records
of
the
gambling
operation
can
be
examined
by
the
secretary
and
section
4906
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
eliminations
of
state
penalties
because
of
this.
the
payment
of
the
tax
involved
in
this
case
if
your
honors
please,
cannot
be
made
without
the
registration
required
by
section
4412.
at
the
very
least,
the
payment
of
the
tax
represents
an
admission
that
the
proposed
taxpayer
is
in
that
class
of
people
who
are
obligated
and
liable
for
the
excised
tax
under
4401.
and
the
registration
requirements
require
even
additional
information
regarding
that
aspect
to
the
gambling
business.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
if
your
honor
please.
the
registration
form
is
in
the
record
after
page
6.
the
government
has
appended
to
its
brief
an
additional
form
bearing
the
same
number
but
a
different
effective
date
which
--
it
contends
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
there
was
no
new
record
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
published
for
this
case.
it
bares
number
41
probably
on
your
--
it
was
originally
number
826
from
my
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
--
the
form
in
the
record
of
the
costello
case
at
page
6
is
the
form
that
was
in
used
in
connecticut
when
the
--
at
the
time
involved
in
this
case.
an
additional
form,
which
we
submit
does
not
in
anyway
modify
the
constitutional
implication,
is
the
next
as
an
appendix
to
government's
brief
filed
in
the
costello
case
also.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
not
solely
prospective
if
you
please
mr.
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
i
think
perhaps
i
could
point
out
in
a
word
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
question
5
now
reads,
“are
you
or
will
you
be
engaged?”
they
added
the
words
“will
you
be
engaged”.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
right.
the
“will
you
be
receiving
wagers”
was
added
in
the
63
form.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
by
the
form
annexed
to
appendix.
of
this
entire
statutory
scheme
involved
here,
the
commissioner
in
--
of
internal
revenue
in
1962
have
this
to
say
and
i
think
it's
quiet
significant.
the
dilemma
of
the
bookmaker
is
apparent.
if
he
registers
and
pays
the
wagering
taxes,
he
is
generating
evidence
of
his
gambling
activities,
evidence
that
is
available
to
local
authorities.
if
he
does
not
register,
he
exposes
himself
to
the
sanctions
and
penalties
and
contained
in
the
federal
wagering
tax
laws.
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
in
the
lewis
case
over
10
years
ago,
if
this
scheme
does
not
violate
the
privilege,
it's
very
difficult
to
think
of
any
thing
that
would
violate
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
for
these
two
decisions
of
kahriger
and
lewis,
it
seems
clear
that
the
fifth
amendment
violation
here
is
obvious
on
the
phase
both
in
terms
of
incriminating
a
potential
taxpayer
under
federal
law
and
under
state
law.
i
think
the
central
question
then
for
the
court
is,
what
then
is
the
basis
for
kahriger
and
lewis
which
justified
the
result
reached
there?
those
two
decisions
really
stand
on
two
pegs.
the
first
is
hardly
at
issue
anymore
for
reasons
that
i
will
explain.
it
was
the
notion
suggested
in
both
of
the
kahriger
and
lewis
dates
--
cases
that
since
the
petitioner
had
not
purchased
the
tax
stamp
he
couldn't
rely
on
the
privilege.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
albertson
last
term
fairly
clearly
set
that
to
rest
then
i
should
point
out
that
the
government
in
its
brief
does
not
even
claim
to
the
contrary.
so
the
real
issue
in
the
case
is,
what
is
the
foundation
that
has
continuing
merit
in
kahriger
and
lewis
if
any?
the
court
said
in
kahriger
and
lewis,
that
the
wagering
tax
law
is
prospective
and
only
--
and
one
need
not
go
ahead
and
gamble.
therefore,
there
is
nothing
compulsory.
and
i
think
if
there
is
an
examination
in
detail
of
this
concept,
and
i
point
out
that
in
both
kahriger
and
lewis
there
were
many
other
issues
beside
fifth
amendment
issues.
and
the
fifth
amendment
discussion
in
these
cases
was
very
brief.
what
then
is
the
basis
for
this
notion
of
prospective
application?
and
how
does
it
really
apply?
i
urge
the
court's
attention
to
form
11-c
which
is
in
the
record
as
already
pointed
out.
the
questions
asked,
and
i'm
speaking
now
the
form
as
it
existed
at
the
time
involved
in
this
case.
are
you
engaged
--
among
other
questions,
are
you
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
on
your
own
account?
that's
one
question,
another
is,
"do
you
receive
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
some
other
person
or
persons?"
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
extremely
difficult
to
say,
that
answering
those
questions
as
framed
in
applying
regular
concepts
of
interpretation
means
that
there's
any
thing
in
the
future
about
those
questions.
because
the
question
is
specifically
in
the
past
tense,
“are
you
engaged
in
the
business?”,
and
“do
you
receive
wagers?”
there's
nothing
prospective
about
it.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
we
submit
your
honor
that
even
in
nevada,
there
would
be.
if
this
court
adheres
to
the
so-called
link
in
the
chain
doctrine
of
the
privilege
that
was
established
before
these
cases
and
after
these
cases,
and
that
there
are
several
federal
related
to
gambling
offenses
such
as
interstate
transportation
of
gambling
data.
federal
offenses
which
were
not
on
--
some
of
which
were
not
on
the
books
at
the
time
of
kahriger
and
lewis.
so
even
then,
these
questions
could
very
well
provide
an
investigatory
lead
to
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
i
think
it
has
widespread
application
to
the
states,
except
nevada
course
which
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
as
long
as
the
federal
antigambling
type
law
still
remain.
and
those
--
i
think
that
perhaps
the
best
example
is
the
united
states
against
zizzo
which
is
cited
in
my
brief
where
it
was
--
the
defendant
was
charged
with
violation
of
certain
provisions
of
the
antiracketeering
section,
a
federal
offense.
and
the
wagering
tax
stamp
was
admitted
in
over
his
objection
as
evidenced
against
him
in
the
--
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor,
except
that
it
does
show
that
there
is
definite
and
concrete
fear
of
incrimination
from
a
federal
law
as
well
as
from
the
state,
solely
state
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
we
have
a
problem
in
the
income
tax
of
course
that
does
not
arise
here.
i
think
it
was
really
emphasized
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
albertson
situation
where
the
forms
do
not
zero-in
on
an
activity
that
is
illegal
in
itself.
for
example,
the
income
tax
--
i
do
not
contend
and
perhaps
this
is
the
best
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
i
do
not
contend
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
could
not
pay
his
federal
income
taxes
even
though
they
were
derived
from
the
same
source,
even
though
i
further
contend
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
pay
the
$50
wagering
tax
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
think
the
scope
depends
on
whether
or
not
it's
an
area
as
your
--
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
albertson
where
there
is
an
area
perminated
by
criminal
laws
primarily.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
that
would
fall
within
that
category.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
oh,
he
could
not
refuse
to
make
any
--
it
depends
on
what
type
of
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
the
tax
were
designed
--
if
the
tax
related
to
an
industry
or
a
business
which
was
in
effect
outlawed,
i
think
then
the
principles
of
this
case
come
into
play.
in
other
words,
i
make
no
contention
that
the
petitioner
need
not
pay
his
income
tax
on
the
same
very
activity.
or
that
he
can
fail
to
file
his
federal
income
tax
return,
because
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
if
the
government
chooses
your
honor
to
place
a
tax
on
an
activity
that
is
fundamentally
illegal,
then
i
think
they
run
the
risk
of
the
privilege
intercepting
that
tax.
for
example,
one
of
the
example
cited
by
the
commentators
in
discussing
kahriger
and
lewis
is,
if
there
would've
be
a
law
passed
that
all
burglars
must
register
with
the
united
states,
even
though
there's
no
federal
anti-burglar
law,
that
would
run
a
file
or
the
privilege.
and
i
think
that
the
point
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
is,
that
this
notion
of
prospectiveness
in
kahriger
and
lewis
really
doesn't
salvage
them
from
the
sound
objections
of
the
privilege.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
there
you
come
closer
to
the
income
tax
situation
if
your
honor
please,
whereby
if
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
objection
it
has
to
be
focused
in
a
more
narrow
point.
whereas
here,
we
invalid
the
statute
on
its
face
we
submit
that
violates
the
privilege.
i
did
want
to
emphasize
however
that
we
don't
claim
that
anyone
engaged
in
this
activity
has
a
right
not
to
file
an
income
tax
return.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
your
honor,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
would
maintain
that
that
in
itself
would
violate
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
purchase
of
the
stamp,
at
the
very
best
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
represents
an
admission
or
a
declaration
that
i
intend
to
engage
in
the
business
of
gambling.
and
the
cases
in
the
state
that
have
arisen
which
i've
cited
in
our
brief
which
is
really
a
reply
brief
to
the
costello
situation,
demonstrate
that
it
can
be
used
for
that
very
purpose.
in
a
case
arising
in
tennessee,
it
was
shown
in
a
conspiracy
case
that
the
stamp
had
purchased.
in
one
case,
that's
mentioned
at
page
9
on
my
brief,
it
was
shown
for
that
specific
purpose
to
show
intent
so
that
the
way
this
is
framed
even
the
payment
of
the
$50
in
itself
would
--
be
violative
of
the
privilege
if
your
honor
please.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
i
assumed
your
honor's
hypothesis,
they
cannot
be
isolated.
the
cases
of
the
lower
courts
interpreting
in
the
regulations
insist
that
the
registration
be
made
at
the
time
the
$50
is
tendered.
in
one
case,
the
$50
was
tendered.
the
government
refused
the
$50
because
the
taxpayer
wouldn't
register.
they
then
prosecuted
the
taxpayer
criminally
for
failure
to
have
him
pay
the
$50.
he
plead
as
a
defense
that
he
tried
to
pay
the
$50
and
he
would
--
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
what?
your
honor
that
is
a
technical
choice
but
if
they
propose
taxpayer
is
honest
and
obeys
the
command
of
the
law,
it
now
says
what
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
pardon.
assuming
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
said
that
he
has
no
real
choice
but
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
pardon.
i
didn't
hear
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor,
within
the
concept
of
this
law.
i
think
once
he's
had
the
intent
to
engage
in
the
business
of
gambling,
he
must
register.
and
therefore,
he
has
no
real
choice
to
discontinue.
there
is
a
very
excellent
comment
i
think
on
that
precise
point
mr.
justice
white
which
came
out
last
friday
after
i
have
written
my
brief,
it's
by
professor
john
mansfield
of
the
harvard
law
school
and
its
in
the
new
edition
of
the
supreme
court
review,
and
it
states
this.
“in
the
opinion
in
the
lewis
case,
it
is
stated
as
relevant
to
the
validity
of
the
wagering
tax
registration
requirement
that
the
petitioner
had
no
constitutional
right
to
gamble.
of
course,
he
had
no
right
to
gamble.
that
is
to
say
he
could
be
punished
for
the
act
of
gambling.
but
the
question
is
whether
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
to
impose
upon
the
activity
of
gambling,
punishment,
not
only
for
engaging
in
this
activity
but
such
further
in
particular
burdens
as
arise
from
requiring
disclosure
of
an
intention
to
gamble”.
that
i
think
that
--
the
statement
in
kahriger
and
the
statement
in
lewis
or
rather
the
statement
in
lewis,
that
suggest
that
you
can
always
avoid
this
dilemma
by
just
abandoning
your
notion
to
gamble.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
but
that
of
course
is
not
the
way
tax
now
reads.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
could
be
used
at
any
rate
if
their
--
if
you
were
required
to
register
at
all
as
a
lead
for
past
activities
also.
so
that
it's
not
completely
--
it's
not
completely
perspective.
in
other
words,
if
you
had
been
engaging
in
the
activity
of
gambling
and
decided
to
abandon
that
activity,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
haven't
yet.
but
i
--
i'm
about
come
to
that
and
then
i
think
that
--
that
it
clearly
is
a
violation
under
fifth
amendment,
even
if
it
is
wholly
prospective.
but
that
its
--
the
argument
for
reversal
here
is
not
dependent
upon
that.
i
think
that
the
supplemental
form
now
called
for
a
--
under
the
statutory
scheme
is
clearly
retrospective.
for
example,
there
is
a
requirement
that
10
days
after
you
have
additional
employees,
you
must
relate
their
names
to
the
commissioner.
in
that
situation
then,
it
is
absolutely
a
passed
act
that
is
being
recorded
and
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
applicability
of
it.
perhaps
one
other
face
of
the
weakness
in
kahriger
and
lewis
can
be
demonstrated
by
a
reference
to
united
states
versus
calamaro
in
which
this
case
decided
that
certain
activities
need
not
register.
for
example,
a
runner
in
the
numbers
business
who
did
not
have
the
requisite
proprietary
interest
may
not
have
had
to
register.
but
if
he
were
to
be
elevated
in
the
gambling
business
and
register
and
assuming
that
it
only
applied
prospectively,
then
if
your
honor
please,
it
could
be
used
as
a
lead
to
engage
to
--
bring
about
a
trial
of
the
activities
prohibited
by
the
state.
so
it
seems
that
there
is
really
under
a
keen
analysis
of
the
kahriger
and
lewis
cases,
nothing
that
has
withstood
more
recent
decisions
along
this
area
of
the
law.
the
government
--
its
position
does
restate
the
kahriger
and
lewis
positions.
that
i
cannot
deny.
it
does
not
however
justify
the
underlying
principle.
i
think
its
well
to
point
out
that
in
kahriger
and
in
lewis,
there
was
no
discussion
whatsoever
of
the
older
principles
which
had
been
emphasized
both
before
and
after
that
if
a
information
will
lead
to
an
investigation
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
the
fifth
amendment
for
its
protection.
that
whole
concept
which
is
so
important
to
this
court's
thinking
in
recent
cases,
was
not
even
discussed
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
i
think
that
the
albertson
decision
which
was
handed
down
last
term
when
compared
to
the
kahriger
decision
and
the
lewis
decision,
demonstrates
the
self-incriminatory
nature
of
the
things
that
would
--
which
we
are
here
concerned.
and
this
is
so
i
believe,
even
if
the
comparison
is
made
to
the
new
form
that
the
government
injected
in
this
case
at
this
time.
incidentally
at
the
time
that
the
government
opposed
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
new
form
was
not
been
available.
so
i
think
the
only
form
that
it's
really
an
issue
in
the
case
is
the
form
that
was
annexed
in
the
record
and
which
is
part
of
the
record.
but
the
--
assuming
for
a
moment
the
applicability
of
the
new
form
which
is
annexed
to
the
government's
brief
and
comparing
it
to
the
form
which
this
court
appended
to
its
opinion
in
albertson,
it
just
seems
like
here
as
there,
they
used
the
words
“the
court”,
the
self-incriminatory
nature
of
the
inquiry
is
obvious.
the
first
question
involves
the
name.
the
first
question
in
the
other
--
in
the
tax
form
in
--
asked
for
the
name
and
also
asked
for
the
aliases,
much
as
the
form
in
the
communist
registration
provision.
the
form
5
which
is
one
of
the
key
bits
of
information
that
the
government
wrote
--
6
in
form
11-c,
specifically
ask
for
the
number
of
employees
or
agents
engaged
in
receiving
wagers
on
your
behalf.
there
is
therefore,
nothing
prospective
their.
so
comparing
these
two
forms
together
if
your
honor
please,
it
seems
clear
that
kahriger
and
lewis
cannot
withstand
the
test
of
the
albertson
decision.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
change
if
your
honor
please,
relates
to
paragraphs
5
and
6
of
the
new
form
11-c.
it
now
says,
“are
you
or
will
you
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers?”
that
word,
“will
you
be
engaged
in
the
business”,
was
added.
and
the
next
question
6
said,
"do
you
receive
or
will
you
be
receiving
wagers?”
the
phrase,
“will
you
be
receiving
wagers”
is
the
words
that
--
are
the
words
that
were
added.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
one
more
block
in
the
kahriger-lewis
foundation
i
believe
deserves
mention.
in
the
kahriger
case
the
court
said,
the
privilege
has
relation
to
past
acts
only
and
not
to
future
acts
that
may
or
may
not
occur.
this
we
think
is
basically
unsound
in
this
context.
first
of
all,
it
came
solely
from
a
citation
in
wigmore
and
the
background
material
in
wigmore
demonstrates
that
it
really
has
no
application
to
this
context.
for
what
wigmore
was
talking
about
were
occupation
such
as
--
and
this
are
the
examples
he
mentioned
pawn
brokers
and
drugers
who
had
to
refer
to
certain
licensing
and
reporting
obligations.
nothing
of
the
nature
here
involved
where
the
activity
is
so
fundamentally
illegal.
i
think
another
aspect
to
this
that
varies
mentioned
is
that
no
court
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
kahriger
in
any
way
stood
and
upheld
the
principle
that
is
born
out
in
the
wigmore
generalization.
so
the
recent
cases
of
this
court
if
your
honor
please,
undercut
the
foundations
of
kahriger
and
lewis.
the
government
offers
no
basis
to
show
how
these
rationales
of
kahriger
and
lewis
are
consistent
with
the
doctrine
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
it's
now
known.
i'm
well
aware
of
course
that
the
members
of
the
court
have
been
decided
on
certain
issues
relating
to
the
fifth
amendment
divided
on
certain
issues
related
to
the
fifth
amendment.
but
nothing
in
the
recent
disents
in
garrity
and
spevack
or
malloy,
suggest
that
there's
any
vitality
left
to
the
kahriger
and
lewis
cases.
from
a
common
practical
everyday
point
of
view,
what
do
we
have
with
this
tax?
we
have
a
wagering
tax
which
the
united
states
says,
cannot
pay
for
itself.
in
other
words,
it
cost
more
to
enforce
it
than
it
nets
the
government.
and
we
have
it
working
as
a
squeezing
device
on
the
citizens.
the
citizen
has
the
choice
to
comply
or
to
defy
the
wagering
tax
law.
if
he
complies
with
the
wagering
tax
law,
he
puts
himself
in
a
state
jail.
if
he
defies
the
wagering
tax
law,
he
puts
himself
into
a
federal
jail.
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
this
is
fundamentally
opposed
to
the
whole
concept
of
the
fifth
amendment.
almost
as
if
in
accord
with
that
notion,
the
government
spends
very
little
time
attempting
to
bolster
kahriger
and
lewis.
what
the
government
does
if
your
honors
please,
is
offer
to
this
court
as
an
alternative,
the
suggestion
that
there
need
not
be
invalidation
of
these
tax
statutes.
what
does
the
government
say?
the
government
says
assuming
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutionally
violative
of
the
privilege.
there
is
no
need
here
to
uphold
the
traditional
right
to
silence
which
is
the
backbone
of
the
fifth
amendment.
rather
says
the
government,
“leave
the
tax
statute
standing
but
exclude
from
evidence
anything
that
comes
from
the
tax
laws
so
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
incrimination
in
the
future.”
what
the
government
then
says
is
we
must
have
an
exclusionary
rule,
down
with
the
concept
of
silence
which
is
so
fundamental
with
the
fifth
amendment
right
and
up
with
the
concept
of
an
exclusionary
rule.
as
a
basis
for
this
rule,
the
government
relies
almost
exclusively
on
murphy
versus
the
waterfront.
and
i
think
that
that
case
must
be
put
in
context
to
show
why
the
exclusionary
rule
that
the
government
relies
upon
has
no
real
application.
in
the
murphy
case
if
your
honor
please,
the
concept
of
dual
sovereignty
was
overturned
by
this
court.
after
that
was
done,
the
court
then
faced
this
problem
and
it
said
it
quite
specifically,
we
must
now
decide
what
effect
our
abandonment
of
dual
sovereignty
has
on
the
state
immunity
statute.
for
in
the
murphy
case,
unlike
situation
in
the
case
at
bar
there
were
state
immunity
statutes
involved.
the
witnesses
had
been
afforded
immunity
by
the
states
of
new
jersey
and
the
state
of
new
york
which
were
there
involved.
so
the
sole
issue
in
the
case
involved
in
murphy
was
how
do
we
rule
in
connection
with
the
immunity
statute.
the
court
had
two
alternatives
that
faced
it.
if
the
court
would
have
said,
“alright,
we
will
uphold
the
traditional
right
to
silence”,
which
is
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
would
have
in
effect
invalidated
all
state
immunity
statutes
because
it
was
fundamental
that
the
states
could
not
extend
immunity
from
federal
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
would
have
expanded
the
doctrine
of
immunity,
it
would
have
run
completely
afoul
with
the
supremacy
clause
since
its
fundamental
where
the
states
cannot
extend
to
federal
prosecution,
immunity
from
prosecution.
so
the
result
in
that
peculiar
circumstances
where
immunity
statutes
were
an
issue
was
to
fashion
this
exclusionary
rule.
but
the
exclusionary
rule
has
no
application
here
because
of
the
lack
of
the
immunity
legislation.
i
think
perhaps
the
case
that
most
clearly
demonstrates
this
is
malloy
versus
hogan,
decided
the
very
day
as
murphy.
in
the
malloy
case,
there
was
no
immunity
statute
and
the
court
upheld
the
traditional
right
to
silence
in
reversing
and
they
did
not
fashion
an
immunity
statute.
so
for
these
reasons
if
your
honor
please,
we
think
that
the
immunity
alternative,
immunity
from
use,
that
the
government
proposes
is
not
a
meaningful
one
and
that
the
traditional
right
to
silence
in
this
fifth
amendment
area
should
be
upheld.
we
think
that
kahriger
and
lewis
were
wrongly
decided
and
that
recent
decisions
of
this
court
clearly
emphasize
that.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
know
of
no
statistical
summaries
of
that
nature
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
government
may
have
some
private
information
to
that
effect.
i
would
however
point
out
the
court
at
page
7
of
my
brief,
i
have
catalogued
some
of
the
cases,
a
good
number
of
them
where
the
subsequent
state
conviction
was
predicated
at
least
in
part
upon
the
compliance
with
the
federal
wagering
tax
laws.
and
there
they're
listed
as
i
count
them
about
10
or
12
convictions.
i
have
no
doubt
that
that's
used
widely
in
--
throughout
the
country.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
have
just
a
few
comments
in
reply
if
your
honor
please.
the
government
charges
that
we're
looking
for
some
sort
of
protective
status
from
mr.
marchetti
because
he's
engaged
in
the
gambling
business.
that's
not
so.
what
this
case
really
boils
down
to
is
we're
asking
that
mr.
marchetti
in
bridgeport,
connecticut,
is
it
required
to
answer
the
question,
are
you
engaged
in
an
illegal
activity?
and
i
think
that
we're
not
asking
for
something
of
special
import.
it
is
pointed
out
quite
clearly
perhaps
in
a
footnote
in
the
government's
brief.
footnote
25
--
i'm
sorry,
footnote
21,
page
22
of
the
government
brief,
where
the
government
says,
“we
recognize
that
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
the
matters
here
involved,
registration
and
filing
of
a
wagering
tax
return
and
the
filing
of
an
income
tax
return.”
this
is
so,
because
the
income
tax
return
permits
reporting
of
the
income
without
specific
identification
of
source.
and
we
think
that
distinction
which
they
concede
is
crucial
and
undermines
their
claim
that
we're
asking
for
a
protective
status
of
any
kind.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
not
really
--
that
is
not
--
it
is
--
the
government's
concession
is
correct
your
honor.
for
this
reason,
there
are
not
the
collateral
penalties
involved
if
you
do
not
fill
in
all
the
same
information
in
1040
as
there
are
if
you
don't
fill
any
information
here.
that
--
as
i
understand,
and
i
maybe
wrong
in
this,
if
you
offer
the
united
states
$10,000
in
income
tax,
they'll
take
it.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
you
offer
them
$50
to
buy
a
stamp
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
they
will
not
take
it
though,
if
you're
unpleased.
if
you
offer
them
$50
to
buy
a
stamp,
they
will
not
take
it
anonymously.
that's
--
i
think
an
important
thing,
they're
not
out
for
anonymous
collection
of
income
as
they
are
in
the
income
tax
situation.
i
think
one
other
point
merit
some
consideration
and
it
relates
to
inquiries
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
chief
justice
suggested
for
--
that
the
government
was
perhaps
proposing
some
kind
of
confidentiality
as
the
alternative
remedy
in
this
case.
what
the
government
ignores
to
comment
i
think
is
on
section
6107,
which
is
very
important
part
of
the
same
act.
in
the
principle
internal
revenue
office
in
each
internal
revenue
district,
there
shall
be
kept
for
public
inspection
an
alphabetical
list
of
names
of
all
persons
who
had
paid
special
taxes
under
this
subtitle
so
there's
no
concept
here
of
confidentiality.
in
fact,
there's
a
congressional
intent
to
the
opposite.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that's
the
wagering
tax
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
this
section
that
i
read
your
honor
refers
to
the
wagering
tax
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
it
may
apply
to
a
few
other
special
taxes
but
it's
in
this
section,
its
6107
of
title
26.
if
your
honor
please,
that
brings
us
to
the
related
issue
of
this
nonuse
rule
that
mr.
justice
fortas
touched
upon.
the
government
would
not
quite
say,
at
least
if
they
did
say
it
orally,
they
were
modifying
their
position
in
the
brief
that
they
were
advocating
a
nonuse
rule.
because
by
nonuse,
i
believe
mr.
justice
fortas
had
in
mind
an
immunity
situation
and
the
government
will
not
concede
that
in
their
brief.
they're
very
strong
to
emphasize
that
they
have
no
objection
to
mr.
marchetti
being
prosecuted
but
when
a
state
prosecutor
introduces
evidence
a,
we
then
object
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
a
and
we
say
the
united
states
must
have
given
you
this
information,
that's
where
you
got
it
and
therefore
it
must
be
excluded.
that's
the
only
rule
the
government
would
offer
us
now.
i
say
your
honor
that
is
no
substitute
for
the
right
to
remain
silent
which
is
really
the
cornerstone
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
before
these
reasons
your
honor,
i
should
add
one
more
thought
on
this
point
your
honor.
even
assuming
arguendo
that
there
were
some
adoption
by
this
court
of
the
murphy
type
rule,
which
as
i
said
in
my
main
argument,
it
has
no
application
whatsoever
when
there's
no
state
immunity
statute
at
issue
and
there's
none
here.
there
would
still
be
no
basis
to
affirm
these
convictions
because
the
court
just
as
it
did
in
murphy
should
afford
an
opportunity
to
have
the
petitioner
know
the
rule
that
is
now
being
enacted.
in
murphy
for
example,
the
convictions
were
reversed
as
the
court
announced
the
new
rule.
and
the
same
if
murphy
word
to
be
applied
to
this
situation,
the
same
remedy
must
apply
and
the
convictions
under
all
circumstances
must
be
reversed.
for
all
of
these
reasons
therefore
your
honor
i
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
understand
the
solicitor
general
passed
a
preliminary
motion
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
for
the
second
time
with
additional
questions
having
been
propounded
by
the
court
last
term
after
argument.
considering
the
responses
of
the
government
to
those
questions
and
setting
to
one
side
some
of
the
finer
refinements
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
the
central
crucial
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
this
petitioner
can
be
fined
thousand
dollars
and
sent
to
prison
for
a
year
for
failing
to
answer
the
following
questions
in
connection
with
the
wagering
tax
laws.
among
those
questions
are;
are
you
engaged
in
business
of
accepting
wagers
on
your
own
account
and
do
you
receive
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
other
person
or
persons.
to
put
the
wagering
tax
laws
in
context
and
to
understand
the
group
upon
which
this
laws
call
for
such
responses,
i
thought
it
might
be
appropriate
to
consider
seven
groups
in
the
general
gambling
community.
in
the
first
group,
if
your
honors
please,
might
be
the
sweepstakes
operators
such
as
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
in
the
second
circumstance,
set
of
circumstances
might
be
the
casino
operators
of
las
vegas
of
which
we
are
all
familiar
with,
the
posh
casinos
and
the
games
of
roulette,
craps,
stud
poker,
black
jack,
bingo,
what
have
you?
in
the
third
group,
we
could
place
the
parimutuel
operators
at
the
large
race
tracks
throughout
the
eastern
sea
board.
and
then
in
another
group
what
i
call
the
fourth
group
might
be
the
bingo
group,
numerous
small
games
of
this
quality
throughout
the
country.
in
the
fifth
group
we
could
have
church
lotteries
and
raffles
and
in
the
sixth
group,
the
friendly
pool
on
the
world
series
in
the
office
of
a
large
law
firm
or
any
other
office
which
is
so
common
throughout
the
country.
the
seventh
and
last
group
might
include
the
bookmaker
and
the
pool
selling
operator
and
it
is
that
seventh
group
only
if
this
court
please,
upon
which
the
wagering
tax
laws
operate.
i
think
if
there's
one
though
i'd
like
to
leave
with
the
court
today,
it
would
that
i
would
like
to
dispel
the
notion
that
gambling
is
gradually
becoming
legalized.
in
las
vegas
we
have
legalized
gambling
and
we
have
sweepstakes
and
we
have
bingo,
we
have
various
forms
of
gambling
that's
generally
becoming
a
neutral
activity.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
a
neutral
non-criminal
activity
mixed
with
the
--
neutral
used
in
the
sense
of
the
albertson
case,
if
your
honor
please.
i
think
that's
the
notion
that
i
would
like
to
dispel
because
this
case
operates
and
the
taxes
imposed
by
this
case
operate
only
on
the
seventh
group
that
i
mentioned,
the
illegal
--
essentially
on
the
seventh
group
i
mentioned,
the
illegal
bookmaker
activity.
the
act
by
special
definition
excludes
the
sweepstakes
and
also
excludes
parimutuel
betting
and
it
also
excludes
the
gambling
casinos
of
las
vegas
not
specifically
but
that
type
of
gambling
activity
by
the
manner
in
which
way
during
is
defined
in
the
act.
if
you're
dealing
with
an
activity
where
the
contestants
play
in
the
presence
of
each
other
and
all
the
winners
are
determined
in
the
presence
of
each
other
such
as
roulette,
or
craps
at
one
the
casinos,
that
activity
is
specifically
defined
out
of
the
way
during
tax
laws.
so
i
think
then
we
have
a
situation
clearly
within
this
courts
pronouncement
in
the
albertson
case
that
where
--
have
a
tax
directed
to
a
group
which
is
primarily
involved
in
criminal
activity
and
which
is
inherently
criminal.
i
think
the
notion
that
i
would
like
to
dispel
is
that
its
not.
as
i
said
before,
it's
not
an
activity
where
there's
mostly
illegal
activity
and
that
we
can't
let
the
states
bin
this
label
of
illegality
to
this
conduct
so
as
to
thwart
the
revenues.
now,
of
course
we
would
consider
the
group
upon
which
the
tax
works.
it's
important
and
necessary
to
consider
how
the
tax
actually
functions.
under
the
leading
section
of
the
act
which
is
more
directly
involved
in
the
next
case
that
professor
rightful
discussed,
there's
a
10%
tax
on
wagers
as
i've
defined
it
to
you.
then,
there
must
be
a
$50
stamp
purchased
under
section
4411
and
in
conjunction
with
that
stamp
a
detailed
questionnaire
must
be
filed
with
the
internal
revenue
service.
as
i
started
to
point
out
a
moment
ago
that
questionnaire
is
in
form
11-c
which
is
annexed
to
my
supplemental
brief.
it
asked
for
the
taxpayer's
full
name,
all
aliases,
business
address,
residence
address,
the
name
of
all
of
the
taxpayer's
principals,
the
name
of
all
the
taxpayers'
employees.
and
it
requires
that
this
information
must
be
filed
at
the
time
the
$50
wagering
tax
stamp
is
purchased.
a
collateral
section
in
the
act
makes
it
mandatory
for
the
person
engaged
in
this
activity
to
keep
track,
keep
a
record
of
every
single
wage
that
he
makes
and
then
section
4423
of
the
code
makes
it
clear
that
this
records
which
have
been
kept
by
every
wager
can
be
inspected
at
the
desire
of
the
internal
revenue
commissioner.
rounding
up
the
statutory
scheme,
your
honors
please,
there
are
provisions
which
say
specifically
that
payment
of
this
tax
does
not
excuse
the
taxpayer
from
any
violation
of
state
law
or
federal
law
and
it
also
specifically
provides
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
if
we
would
have
bought
the
tax,
would
have
had
under
the
mandatory
provisions
of
the
act,
his
name
and
address
listed
publicly
and
available
for
state
prosecutor.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
congress
specifically
put
in
that
section.
i'm
speaking
of
section
6107
of
the
act.
that
for
a
certain
some
state
prosecutors
can
have
some
certified
copies
of
this
information
that's
been
filed
in
connection
with
the
wagering
tax
laws.
in
addition
to
that,
once
the
stamp
has
been
purchased,
the
taxpayer
must
display
it
prominently
on
his
premises
and
in
conjunction
with
that
point,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
if
he
forgets
in
a
non-willful
manner
to
display
this
there's
also
a
punishment
even
if
it's
just
negligence.
with
this
group
that
i
mentioned
upon
whom
the
tax
works
and
the
what
and
wherefore
of
the
tax
explained,
it
seems
that
once
it
is
recognized
the
nature
of
the
underlying
gambling
activity
in
this
country,
that
the
self-incriminatory
aspects
of
the
tax
as
applied
are
fairly
obvious.
gambling
of
course
and
this
is
conceded
by
the
government
is
illegal
every
place
in
the
united
states
except
in
nevada,
with
exceptions
to
the
specific
things
that
i've
mentioned
most
of
which
are
excluded
from
operation
of
the
way
during
tax
laws
and
since
this
issue
was
originally
resolved
some
fifteen
years
ago
in
the
kahriger
case
over
dissent
and
the
lewis
case
also
over
dissent.
the
federal
government
has
gotten
into
the
picture
considerably
more.
i
have
set
forth
in
our
supplemental
brief
a
list
of
the
various
federal
laws
at
page
7
that
the
united
states
now
comes
in
--
come
into
play
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
although
there
--
some
of
these
weren't
effect
at
the
time
the
court
first
considered
the
wagering
tax
laws.
there
have
been
additional
statutes
added.
so
considering
first
the
group
that
i've
referred
to
and
then
considering
the
how
of
the
act,
how
it
operates
and
the
nature
of
the
activity,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
rely
with
some
confidence
on
this
courts
pronounced,
unanimous
announcement
on
the
albertson
case
that
when
the
activity
is
essentially
permeated,
the
criminal
conduct,
there
is
a
purpose
by
which
the
self-incrimination
clause
can
be
utilized.
and
i
think
malloy
also
comes
into
the
picture
at
this
point
because
malloy
versus
hogan
decided
after
kahriger
and
after
lewis
established
also
that
the
test
to
use
is
whether
or
not
it
can
possibly
result
in
crim
--
in
incrimination.
and
i
think
if
you
measure
the
framework,
measure
the
context,
i
think
the
opposite
result
follows
that
in
the
context
of
this
act
there
cannot
be
anything
but
incrimination
by
the
payment
of
the
wagering
tax
law
--
stamp.
after
the
case
was
here
last
term,
the
court
as
i
mentioned
set
it
down
for
reargument
and
directed
counsel
to
brief
two
additional
questions
which
i'll
discuss
in
just
a
moment.
i
should
perhaps
point
out
that
the
fifth
amendment
argument
upon
which
we
rely
today
was
considered
and
rejected
by
the
district
court
without
opinion.
the
district
court
ruling
was
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board.
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
opinion
written
by
judge
friendly
of
the
second
circuit
considered
the
issue
prior
to
the
rendition
of
the
albertson
case
and
albertson
came
down
i
think
about
fourteen
days
after
the
second
circuit
acted
and
we
promptly
move
for
reargument.
in
that
motion
for
reargument
the
response
of
judge
friendly
was
that
albertson
very
well
may
lead
this
court
to
reconsider
its
rulings
in
kahriger
and
lewis
but
it
felt
that
any
change
in
the
situation
should
come
from
this
court
and
not
from
the
lower
court.
subsequent
to
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
a
companion
case
entitled
the
united
states
versus
costello.
costello
died
before
the
matter
was
heard
and
certiorari
was
granted
in
the
present
case,
in
the
marchetti
case.
in
this
connection
i
should
perhaps
point
out
what
its
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
that
we
are
here
on
the
costello
record
but
that
costello
and
marchetti
were
codefendants
in
the
district
court
and
that
the
record
was
similar
and
there's
no
factual
dispute
on
the
record,
it's
purely
a
matter
of
the
fifth
amendment
applied
to
the
wagering
tax
laws.
as
to
the
two
additional
questions,
if
your
honors
please,
which
was
propounded
by
the
court
last
term,
one
is
whether
or
not
the
required
records
doctrine
of
shapiro
as
any
application
to
this
case
and
the
other,
if
your
honors
please,
is
whether
or
not
the
registration
requirement
of
section
4412
which
is
related
to
form
11-c
that
i
quoted
before
can
be
met
without
--
i'm
sorry,
whether
the
tax
provision
of
4411
can
be
met
without
the
registration
provision
being
complied
with.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
it
was
directed
in
my
case
also
if
your
honor
please
and
the
government
originally
had
concede
that
it
--
that
they
could
not
be
isolated
in
our
case
and
they
had
modified
their
position
in
grosso
to
say
this
comment,
it
also
cannot
be
paid
without
compliance
with
the
registration
in
the
grosso
case.
as
to
the
required
records
doctrine
and
as
to
the
additional
question
concerning
the
payment,
if
the
court
please,
the
government
and
petitioner
essentially
in
agreement.
i
think
perhaps
the
best
summary
of
the
government's
position
is
contained
in
the
original
brief
at
page
25.
the
government
stated
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
presently
to
consider
any
possible
relationship
between
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
the
so-called
required
records
doctrine
in
shapiro
versus
united
states.
no
such
issue
is
involved
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
government
reaffirmed
that
in
their
brief
on
reargument
although
they
had
a
slight
modification
and
attempted
to
draw
some
support
from
what
i
might
call
the
spirit
of
shapiro
rather
than
shapiro
itself
as
to
justifying
this
courts
earlier
decision
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
on
the
second
point,
here
again
the
parties
are
in
complete
accord.
the
government
concedes
forthrightly
that
the
tax,
the
$50
stamp
cannot
be
purchased
without
registering,
without
giving
the
name
and
address
of
your
business,
without
giving
the
names
and
address
of
all
your
employees
or
your
principals,
and
without
an
effect
confessing
to
whether
or
you're
engaged
in
the
business
of
gambling,
either
for
yourself
or
in
behalf
of
someone
else.
i
think
this
point
was
clearly
called
for
by
the
decisions
of
the
lower
court
particularly
the
third
circuit
decision
where
a
taxpayer
had
attempted
to
pay
the
tax
and
not
register
and
that
was
held
in
his
case
not
to
be
a
defense.
moreover,
the
registration
provisions
specifically
provide
that
in
section
4412
that
the
registration
shall
be
made
and
there
are
correlative
regulations
issued
by
the
commissioner
of
the
treasury
department
which
this
court
--
support
that.
here
again,
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
we're
clearly
within
--
what
the
court
said
in
the
albertson
case,
there
is
nothing
here
which
permits
less
than
literal
and
full
compliance
with
the
registration
requirements
and
the
form
that
is
required
to
register.
the
government,
although
admitting
as
i
have
said
that
the
registration
must
be
completed
repeatedly
characterizes
this
information
which
i've
just
discussed
has
minimal,
i'm
not
so
particularly
with
the
label
minimal
or
maximal
but
i
think
that
as
a
label
in
this
context
considering
the
nature
of
the
underlying
activity
involved,
this
can
hardly
be
considered
minimal.
in
connecticut
for
example,
it
is
a
violation
of
our
law
to
frequent
a
place
which
has
the
reputation
for
being
a
gambling
hall.
there
are
many,
many
statutes
where
the
information
contained
in
this
registration
would
be
a
virtual
confession
to
violation
of
state
law
and
perhaps
it's
substantially
to
a
conviction
of
federal
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
don't
think
the
government
denies
it,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
government's
position
is
--
well,
we
have
to
have
some
information
to
collect
the
tax
and
it
has
to
bend.
we
have
to
have
this
information,
how
can
you
collect
the
tax,
how
can
you
collect
the
tax
if
you
don't
know
where
the
taxpayer
lives,
if
you
don't
what
this
business
is,
that
type
of
thing.
i
should
point
out,
if
your
honor
please,
the
government
argues
in
their
opening
brief
and
i
think
this
is
important
in
connection
with
their
repeated
assertions
if
they're
only
looking
for
minimal
information
in
this
case.
the
government
points
out
in
their
opening
brief
disclosures
often
highly
detailed
and
this
is
page
13
of
their
opening
brief,
are
required
under
federal
law
of
those
who
chose
--
choose
to
engage
in
many
occupations
and
then
they
list
15
u.s.c.
involving
disclosures
from
the
investment
bankers
and
then
they
list
disclosures
required
of
radio
stations
and
then
they
list
disclosures
from
air
carriers,
then
they
list
disclosures
from
motor
carriers,
then
they
list
disclosures
from
lobbyist
and
there
they
list
--
and
then
they
also
list
disclosures
from
stockyard
dealers,
market
agencies
and
officers
and
employees
of
labor
union.
but
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
think
this
is
where
albertson
play
such
a
big
role.
to
test
to
measure
those
disclosures,
not
give
the
label
minimal
or
maximal
against
the
underlying
activity
to
which
they
relay.
where
in
connecticut,
i'm
sorry,
where
in
this
country
is
it
to
be
an
illegal
to
be
an
investment
adviser?
where
is
it
a
crime
to
run
a
radio
station?
where
is
it
a
crime
to
run
an
airplane?
where
is
it
a
crime
to
run
a
labor
union?
where
is
it
a
crime
to
run
a
motor
truck?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
question
which
the
court
so
emphasized
in
albertson
dispels
the
notion
of
minimum
disclosure
that
the
government
urges
in
this
case.
in
fact,
in
the
examples
that
they've
cite
in
their
brief
that
i've
just
referred
to
there
is
no
suggestion
of
illegality.
but
in
our
case,
in
the
case
before
the
court
today
the
entire
area
is
permeated
in
the
criminal
activity
as
the
term
is
used
in
the
albertson
case.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor
and
although
narcotics
tax
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
as
--
you
know
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
basis
of
the
taxing
power
per
se
it
has
not
been
reviewed
against
fifth
amendment
problems
and
i
noticed
--
i
think
its
particularly
significant
that
the
government
didn't
cite
the
marijuana
tax
of
the
narcotics
tax
when
they
were
requiring
disclosures.
so
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
situation
requiring
narcotics
is
very
close
in
principle
to
the
gambling
situation
i
would
concede.
the
possession
of
narcotics
is
essentially
illegal
throughout
the
united
states.
and
it
would
depend
i
think
precisely
on
the
nature
of
the
disclosures
required
by
the
various
acts
to
what
extent
they
are.
they
very
well
may
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
constitutional
scrutiny
that
is
required
by
fifth
amendment
examination
that
we
urge
here
in
light
of
albertson.
that
question
has
never
been
answered
by
the
court
to
my
knowledge
although
as
i've
said
before
they
have
been
upheld
on
the
basis
in
the
taxing
power
but
they
were
definitely
upheld
in
the
area
of
the
tenth
amendment
whether
or
not
the
narcotics
and
marijuana
acts
infringe
on
the
powers
of
the
state.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
in
the
marijuana
situation?
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
we
say
this
if
your
honor
please,
we
take
two
positions
on
that.
we
say
that
that
at
first
and
the
government
concede
is
the
information
must
be
supplied
that
the
government
concedes.
now
if
you're
opposing
a
new
statute
which
could
be
affected
so
as
no
information
is
required
that
would
tend
to
incriminate
then
we
say
that
doesn't
run
or
follow
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
one
thing
that
might
be
worth
emphasizing
at
this
point
in
response
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
limited
scope
of
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
very
case.
i
presented
to
the
court
in
my
petition
for
certiorari
a
tenth
amendment
argument
and
i
think
that
you
can
argue
forcefully
as
some
of
the
dissenters
did
in
kahriger
that
the
congress
was
merely
attempting
to
regulate
state
activity
here.
but
i'm
setting
that
to
one
side,
i
don't
ask
this
court
to
rely
on
that
argument
at
all.
i
realized
that
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
there
can
be
compliance
with
this
tax
without
running
the
risk
of
violating
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
way
that
tax
is
now
framed,
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
clear
under
albertson
that
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
cannot
be
avoided.
now
if
we
say,
can
congress
in
any
way
tax
this
activity
so
it
doesn't
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
i
say
yes.
the
congress
hasn't
elected
to
do
that
at
this
stage,
if
they
very
well
might,
if
we
prevail
in
this
case.
that
congress
might
grant
immunity
as
they've
done
in
some
many,
many
instances
and
as
a
catalogue
in
some
of
the
briefs
in
the
companion
case.
or
if
there
could
conceivably
be
a
way
that
could
be
fashioned
for
the
anonymous
payment
of
this
tax
then
perhaps
it
could
be
paid
without
violating
the
fifth
amendment
but
i
think
under
the
present
structure,
by
the
mere
fact
for
example,
that
if
i
buy
a
stamp
i
must
display
it
publicly
on
my
premises
or
face
a
penalty
even
if
i
negligently
fail
to
do
it
and
non-willfully.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
there
can
be
no
compliance
with
the
statute
without
violating
the
fifth
amendment
and
that's
the
basis
of
our
claim
and
i
think
where
we
have
most
of
the
quarrel
with
the
government.
the
government
says
to
us
you
really
saying
you
can
tax
gambling.
and
our
response
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that's
not
our
position.
if
the
congress
wants
to
tax
gambling,
it
may
or
may
not
have
power,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
right
now.
i'm
sure
that
1951
when
this
was
passed,
congress
felt
it
didn't
have
the
power
to
reach
gambling
because
of
the
scope
of
interstate
commerce.
they
may
now
feel
that
they
can
directly
outlaw
gambling.
i
don't
know.
but
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is
we
are
not
maintaining
that
this
cannot
be
taxed
as
the
government
says.
we
would
concede
arguendo
for
the
purposes
of
this
scope
of
this
grant
of
certiorari
that
this
activity
can
be
taxed.
but
what
can't
happen
is
what
was
summarized
so
nicely
in
the
(inaudible)
journal
comment
that
came
out
after
this
case
was
argued
last
term.
what
can
happen
is
this
tax
cannot
be
administered
so
as
to
violate
petitioner's
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
elements
of
this
act,
they
are
bad,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
is
that
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
that
can
be
answered
most
clearly
by
referring
to
form
11-c.
i
think
every
single
question
on
this
form
which
the
government
now
admits
must
be
paid
is
bad.
they
want
the
name
and
address
of
the
business.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
they
want
the
name
and
address
of
your
principals,
who
you're
working
for.
they
want
the
name
and
address
of
all
your
employees
and
there's
a
supplemental
regulation
the
government
issued.
if
you
change
any
of
those
employees
you
must
run
to
the
internal
revenue
commission
within
ten
days
and
give
the
name
and
address
of
the
new
employees.
they
want
to
know
whether
or
not
you
are
engaged
in
a
business
of
accepting
wagers
for
yourself.
they
want
to
know
whether
or
not
you
are
accepting
it
for
somebody
else.
on
top
of
the
form
and
leaving
the
form
to
one
side
and
assuming
arguendo
that
it
could
be
--
the
tax
could
be
purchased
without
the
form
which
is
not
the
case
as
the
government
concede.
the
mere
purchase
and
mandatory
exhibiting
of
the
stamp
is
violative
of
the
privilege
we
maintain.
that's
the
second
bad
aspect
and
perhaps
the
third
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
the
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
the
key
basis
for
distinction
lies
again
in
the
albertson
case,
your
honor,
where
you
must
--
the
court
must
examine
whether
or
not
the
inquiry
is
directed
against
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
activity.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
your
honor.
it's
highly
regulated
but
it's
not
essentially
an
illegal
activity.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
not
too
sure
in
response
to
that
but
i
think
the
important
distinction,
your
honor
is
--
can
be
seen
more
readily
but
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
the
important
distinction
i
think
and
you've
seen
readily
by
comparing
albertson
to
sullivan.
sullivan
holds
that
even
though
you've
made
your
money
illegally,
you
have
to
pay
income
tax
and
maybe
you
can
take
the
fifth
amendment
to
an
individual
question
where
did
the
illegal
bookie
get
his
money
on
his
income
tax
form
and
perhaps
when
the
essential
activity
is
neutralized
in
sullivan
and
i
think
essentially
the
liquor
industry
is
a
legal
industry
or
neutral
within
the
meaning
of
sullivan-albertson
distinction.
then
i
think
the
claim
can
be
made
that
we
fall
within
the
albertson
rationale
that
when
it's
permeated
with
criminal
conduct,
there's
no
obligation
to
file
and
pay
the
tax
and
register
because
you
cannot
conceivably
can
--
no
one
can
comply
with
it
without
incriminating
himself.
now,
i
think
that
brings
up
a
point
i
think
that
is
important,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
there
would
be
stamp
under
the
law
has
to
be
publicly
displayed
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
that
would
be
--
if
i
had
a
stamp
in
my
place
of
business
in
the
city
of
bridgeport
hanging
in
my
window
or
hanging
where
it
can
be
readily
seen
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
it's
virtually
a
confession,
if
your
honor
please,
that
i'm
violating
the
gaming
laws
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
say,
if
your
honor
please,
if
we
get
to
the
point
where
the
government
concedes
the
income
tax
situation
is
where
this
tax
can
be
paid
anonymously.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
the
very
important
distinction
in
the
cases.
for
example,
the
governments
brief
at
page
22
in
their
opening
brief
in
the
costello
case.
we
recognized
that
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
the
matters
involved
here,
registration
and
filing
of
a
wagering
tax
return
and
the
filing
of
an
income
tax
return
at
issue
in
sullivan.
this
is
so
because
the
income
tax
return
permits
reporting
of
income
without
specific
identification
of
source.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
your
honor,
that
--
but
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
without
source
identification
the
anonymous
situation
comes
in
not
to
frequently
in
the
laws
but
not
that
i
think
is
an
analogous
situation
is
the
federal
governments
tax
on
real
estate
conveyances.
if
i
have
closing
of
property
in
bridgeport,
i
send
my
secretary
to
the
post
office.
she
buys
stamps
from
the
post
office
at
a
rate
of
a
dollar,
ten
a
thousand
for
the
value
of
the
property
closed.
no
one
asked
her
name.
no
one
asked
anything.
she
comes
back
and
the
stamps
are
signed
by
me
at
the
closing
and
put
on
the
deed
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
i
think
that
there
is
a
clash
here
that
the
government
must
realize
and
that
it
must
accommodate
the
payment
of
the
tax
so
as
not
to
infringe
the
privilege.
perhaps
the
easiest
way
would
be
to
grant
immunity
that
the
congress
has
elected
to
do
in
its
--
in
many
respects
decided
the
opposite.
it's
asked
that
they
be
publicly
displayed.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor,
if
understand
your
correct
--
question
correctly
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
whether
or
not
someone
like
petitioner
could
pay
his
income
tax
on
his
alleged
illegal
activity
without
disclosing
where
he
got
his
money.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
sir.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
insofar
as
it
requires
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
a
disclosure,
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that's
--
that
specific
provision
which
you're
referring
to
is
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
600
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
shapiro
is
distinguished
by
all
the
parties,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no
and
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
summarize
the
issues.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
did
have
one
other
point
to
make
there.
i
think
that
that
issue
that
required
records
provision
of
the
income
tax
law
which
this
court
is
not
giving
definitive
attention
to
yet
and
which
has
drawn
a
mixed
response
from
the
lower
courts
in
which
the
government
has
not
pressed
review
here
is
somewhat
different
because
as
i
read
that
provision,
it
says
you
must
keep
those
records.
now,
the
next
step
may
be
and
would
obviously
be
from
a
point
of
law
--
point
of
view
of
tax
enforcement
that
you
must
keep
them
because
someday
we're
going
to
want
to
look
at
it.
when
that
someday
comes,
we
may
have
a
condition
that's
akin
to
shapiro
but
right
now
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
you
have
to
be
compelled
under
section
6001
to
keep
those
records.
i
think
that
if
the
time
comes
when
the
government
says
you
must
produce
those
record
that
you
can
claim
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
is
correct.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
is
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
that
is
the
income
tax
situation
posed
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
that
the
situation
why
shapiro
doesn't
apply
here
can
--
shapiro
can
be
distinguished
within
the
limits
set
up
in
shapiro
itself.
shapiro
holds
as
--
you
suggested
mr.
justice
white
that
in
the
context
of
the
opa
regulations,
certain
records
which
would
ordinarily
be
kept
anyway
which
is
not
the
situation
of
the
course
in
the
gambling
tax
situation.
certain
records
which
can
ordinarily
be
kept
anyway
can
be
subpoenaed
and
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
think,
if
you
please
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
they
are
not
--
the
records
that
are
ordinarily
kept
in
the
regular
course
of
business.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas
and
my
response
is
as
follows:
i
do
not
believe
that
acceptance
of
our
position
here
requires
the
invalidation
of
the
hypothetical
situation
which
you
posed
in
connection
with
the
maintaining
of
records
in
connection
with
the
income
tax.
and
i
think
and
i
go
back
again,
i
think
that
it
relates
to
the
total
context.
income,
the
constant
generation
of
income
in
this
country
is
essentially
a
neutral
non-criminal
activity.
one
person,
perhaps
the
petitioner
in
this
case
may
participate
in
certain
illegal
activity
and
he
may
have
a
right
to
claim
his
individual
privilege
against
self
adminis
--
self-incrimination
at
the
appropriate
time.
but
it
does
not
require
the
invalidation
of
the
record
keeping
provision
directed
to
the
country
at
large.
but
in
our
particular
case,
that
congress
has
singled
out
almost
exclusively
not
even
all
kinds
of
gambling
because
they
have
let
out
the
church
gambling.
they've
let
out
the
las
vegas
gambling,
almost
exclusively,
illegal
gambling.
and
i
say
almost
exclusively
because
the
tax
does
apply
to
the
las
vegas
bookie
and
it
does
apply
to
the
las
vegas
policy
operator.
but
because
of
the
peculiar
regulations,
some
of
which
i
referred
to
in
my
brief,
they're
pretty
much
an
insignificant
aspect
to
the
matter.
in
las
vegas
for
example,
a
bookmaker
can't
be
in
a
casino.
bookmaking
must
be
isolated
from
the
general
gambling
activity
under
the
nevada
regulations.a
bookmaker
in
nevada
must
pass
the
federal
tax
to
the
customer
and
that's
permissible
with
the
federal
regulation.
but
if
a
non-nevada
bookmaker
passes
the
tax
along,
he
must
give
the
name
and
address
of
his
customer
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
well,
when
that
occurs
in
any
one
of
the
other
fifty
states
besides
nevada
that
immediately
places
the
customer
in
jeopardy
of
violating
the
law.
such
is
not
the
case
in
nevada
because
it's
legal
to
bet
with
nevada
bookmakers.
so
i
think
the
central
core
of
the
case
rest
pretty
much
with
that
distinction,
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
think
the
peculiar
wording
in
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
indicates
that
distinction
because
the
question
is
not
just,
should
kahriger
and
lewis
be
overturned
but
should
kahriger
and
lewis
be
overturned
in
the
light
of
albertson.
and
albertson
with
its
continuing
comments
on
the
sullivan
case,
the
income
tax
situation
that
mr.
justice
holmes
points
out
that
distinction.
now
i
think
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
many
refinements
in
the
firearms
registration
act
which
will
be
argued
immediately
following
these
two
cases.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
would
agree
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
here
again
i
think
it
depends
on
the
underlying
activity
in
the
regulations
requiring
the
keeping
of
guns
in
the
various
states.
i
think
that
our
position
is
very
similar
to
the
circuit
court
opinion
in
the
russell
case
where
the
circuit
court
struck
down
one
provision
of
the
firearm
registration
act
and
which
the
government
has
not
--
apparently
the
government
has
acquiesced
in
and
i
think
therefore
that
that
is
the
aspect
that
is
closely
akin
to
the
wagering
tax
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
during
the
luncheon
recess,
one
of
the
persons
in
the
spectator's
session
of
the
court
inquired
of
me
and
perhaps
this
is
an
emotional
approach
to
this
case
that
bears
a
moments
comment,
i
pay
my
taxes
why
shouldn't
your
petitioner
pay
his
taxes.
and
i
think
i
should
just
take
one
moment
to
emphasize
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
it
does
not
involve
the
income
tax.
it
does
not
involve
a
gamblers
duty
to
pay
tax
on
income
he
makes
in
wagering
or
in
conducting
wagering
activities.
the
government
concedes
this
in
its
brief
in
the
session
that
i've
pointed
out
to
before.
i
think
and
i
believe
i
have
responded
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
inquiry
just
before
the
recess
and
i
think
there
is
one
statement
in
the
government's
brief
that
perhaps
summarize
this,
it's
an
example,
summarizes
where
we
feel
they're
taking
us
to
somewhat
faulty
approach
to
this
case.
it's
actually
filed
in
the
government's
grosso
brief
at
page
fifteen,
these
are
companion
cases
and
the
government
asked
this
court,
is
a
person
free
to
assert
the
privilege
to
justify
a
failure
to
pay
a
tax
on
his
residential
property
or
to
file
a
property
tax
return
calling
for
his
address?
suppose
that
a
local
grand
jury
is
investigating
prostitution.
a
person
believed
to
own
and
reside
in
a
house
suspected
of
being
(inaudible)
is
summoned
and
asked
to
give
his
address.
in
that
setting
he
may
be
privileged
not
to
answer.
we
assume
he
would
not
however
be
privileged
to
refuse
to
pay
property
taxes
on
the
house
if
he
were
the
owner
even
though
such
payment
might
identify
him
with
the
suspected
activities
at
the
house
as
surely
as
what
his
admission
of
ownership
to
the
grand
jury.
and
with
that
question
i
think
we
can
agree.
but
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is,
is
that
hypothetical
that
the
government
poses
is
not
this
case.
to
make
the
government's
hypothetical
our
case,
substitute
the
general
property
tax
in
their
example
and
say
that
the
state
of
connecticut
or
any
other
state
or
all
of
the
states
for
that
matter
imposeda
specific
property
tax
on
houses
used
for
prostitution.
then
i
think
you
have
the
situation
that
we're
faced
with
today.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
there
would
either
be
a
claim
of
the
privilege,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white,
or
just
a
plain
non-completion
of
it,
as
i
point
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
you're
changing
the
actual
situation
we'd
be
in.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
would
not
say
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
in
the
same
manner
as
it
is
here.
i
would
say
it
violated
the
sullivan
doctrine.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
if
they
would
not
honor
the
privilege
of
the
self-incrimination
that
was
advanced.but
perhaps
i
should
point
what
the
government
admits
in
their
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that's
what
they
say
about
the
wagering
tax
your
honor.
but
they
admit
in
the
income
tax
situation
at
page
22
of
their
brief
that
no
source
must
be
given.
a
gambler,
my
client
if
he
wanted
to,
assuming
arguendo,
he
made
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
illegal
activity.
he
goes
to
internal
revenue
and
says
i
made
a
hundred
thousand
dollars,
here
is
your
tax.i
don't
claim
any
deductions.
i
don't
claim
any
special
exemptions.
i
don't
want
to
disclose
anything
to
you.
the
government
concedes
that's
proper.
that's
the
big
distinction.
this
is
so
because
the
income
tax
return
permits
reporting
of
income
without
specific
identification
of
source.
that's
the
brief
of
the
united
states,
not
my
brief,
so
that's
a
very
important
distinction
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
mr.--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
question's
semantics
but
what
i
feel
in
that
context
is
as
if
it's
a
tax
law
that
applies
across
the
board
reaching
neutral
activity
within
the
meaning
of
albertson
then
the
privilege
may
be
claimed
in
that
specific
question.
but
it
doesn't
invalidate
the
whole
structure
as
we
claim
the
situation
arises
here
because
of
the
fact
that
nobody
can
comply
with
this
tax
without
incriminating
himself.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
think,
your
honor
please,
and
i'm
glad
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
came
up
because
i
remember
last
term
you
referred
to
a
bucket
shop
and
i
think
my
response
wasn't
very
precise.
i
think
this,
the
situation
that
you
hypothecate
where
you
have
a
law
making
--
relating
to
all
securities
dealers
is
one
thing.
but
if
you
have
a
statute
that
says
all
bucket
shop
operators
must
pay
a
special
tax
then
you're
very
close
to
the
wagering
tax
scheme.
under
my
brief
research
on
the
subject,
i
think
every
state
outlaws
bucket
shops.
i
know
in
mr.
justice
holmes'
famous
case,
ballman
versus
fagan,
which
i
perhaps
should
have
put
in
my
brief
and
didn't.
the
question
involved
a
--
the
use
of
the
privilege
via
bucket
shop
operator
and
mr.
justice
holmes
upheld
the
privilege.
they
said
someone
who
is
a
bucket
shop
operator
could
reasonably
fear
incrimination.
this
was
an
oral
question
before
a
grand
jury
i
believe.
and
he
upheld
the
privilege
in
that
bucket
shop
context.
if
the
two
that
--
actually
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
pardon?
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
it
is
an
accepted
thing
but
we
maintained,
if
your
honor
please,
that
since
albertson
that
distinction
has
been
displaced.
albertson
said
point
blank
that
we
draw
no
constitutional
significance
to
an
oral
claim
of
it
in
the
witness
stand
or
a
documentary
registration
requirement
such
as
an
issue
in
albertson.
so
i
think
that
although
there
was
an
earlier
discussion
in
some
of
the
courts'
earlier
cases
that
now
has
gone
by
the
board.
but
i
think
that
the
example
that
you
mentioned
if
we
can
just
take
a
moment
to
give
two
faces
of
that
example,
underlines
the
importance
of
our
position
and
what
we
think
is
the
governments'
faulty
position.
of
course
the
united
states
can
tax
security
dealers
across
the
board
and
it
doesn't
invalidate
the
requirement
for
bucket
shop
operator
to
pay.
of
course
they
can
tax
income
and
a
gambler
must
pay
his
income
tax.
but
when
they
zero
in
and
say
all
bucket
shop
operators
must
pay
a
tax,
all
bookies
must
pay
a
tax.
they
have
so
geared
the
tax
structure
under
their
purported
power
to
tax
so
as
to
compel
a
confession
to
crime.
we
do
not
challenge
the
governments'
right
to
tax.
we
do
challenge
their
right
to
effectuate
the
tax
so
as
to
compel
a
confession
to
criminal
activity
almost
universally
recognized
this
criminal
activity.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
no
your
honor,
not
exactly
correct.
my
position
on
that
precise
point
is
that
the
government
concedes
and
i
was
quoting
before
from
their
brief
at
page
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
our
theory
is
this,
the
income
tax
structure
is
so
set
up
that
they
don't
--
that
the
taxpayer
can
avoid
disclosing
source.
he
doesn't
have
to
specifically
claim
that
privilege.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
he
wants
to
rely
on
the
exemption,
if
he
wants
to
say
that
i
paid
employee
a
to
be
my
runner
in
a
bookie
operation,
he
wants
to
take
that
as
an
exemption.
he
may
have
to
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
we
would
claim,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
situation
is
controlled
by
sullivan
and
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
on
the
form
they
refused
--
could
--
or
the
taxpayer
could
--
say
put
them
in
their
privilege.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
it's
our
position
that
this
--
our
position
in
this
case
does
not
take
us
to
that
issue.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
because
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
i
feel
that
it
doesn't
because
in
that
particular
case
the
requirement
at
that
stage
doesn't
incriminate
remotely
because
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
they're
saying
keep
your
records
in
the
drawer.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
believe
he
does,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
believe
that
is
our
position.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
shapiro
was
read
that
broadly
which
the
government
does
not
asked
the
court
to
do.
if
shapiro
means
that
if
congress
says
any
record
that
we
say
you
must
keep
is
non-privileged,
then
we
get
a
shapiro
issue
and
i
would
respectfully
request
that
the
court
overturn
shapiro.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
read
shapiro
that
broadly.
i
don't
think
the
government
wants
the
court
to
read
shapiro
that
broadly.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
we
read
shapiro
as
not
elevating
to
the
issue
of
this
case
for
the
following
reasons.
in
shapiro,
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
one
in
view
of
the
limited
scope
of
certiorari
in
connection
with
albertson.
in
shapiro,
the
regulations
involved
were
directed
i
believe
to
prove
in
the
wholesale
producers.
there
was
not
a
zeroing
in
on
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
activity,
as
mr.
justice
brennan's
word
in
albertson
and
his
decent
to
the
communist
party
case.
and
i
think
that
--
your
honor's
situation
that
you
posed
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
when
they
make
my
client
bring
the
records
in
if
he
kept
them
and
they
order
him
to
produce
them,
we're
back
to
the
sullivan
situation
where
the
taxpayer
may
have
an
individual
claim.
but
that
as
i
think
is
important
to
emphasize
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't
speak
that.
but
i
was
directing
not
to
this
case
but
to
your
hypothetical.
you're
hypothetical
is
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
that
because
we
have
the
other
very
important
distinction
that
the
government
relies
upon.
it's
set
out
in
our
brief
and
professor
wrights'
brief
in
the
next
case
and
that
distinction
is
this,
that
here
we're
dealing
with
registering
and
openly
confessing.
we're
not
dealing
with
records
kept
and
later
produced
--
i
thought
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
you're
hypothetical
was
the
other
situation.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
say
in
the
context
of
your
hypothetical,
if
this
court
should
determine
that
shapiro
means
that
any
record
required
by
the
congress
to
be
kept
is
non-privileged
then
i
would
respectfully
request
that
shapiro
cannot
withstand
the
later
theory
of
the
fifth
amendment
case.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
don't
have
to
get
to
that
point
in
this
case.
only
in
your
hypothetical
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
do
i
have
to
get
to
that.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
i
make
myself
clear
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
is
to
a
large
measure
the
governments'
position.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
they've
argued
it
under
a
slogan
called
their
accommodation
theory.
in
other
words,
the
minimal
encroachment
on
the
privilege
must
accommodate
the
need
for
information
in
order
to
enforce
the
tax
laws.
we
think
that's
--
theory
is
not
sound
for
reasons
(inaudible).
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
--
i
believe
that's
our
position.
they
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
to
give
way
when
we
need
the
data
to
collect
the
tax.
i'd
like
if
i
may
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
alright.
i
would
like
to
say
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
comment
very
briefly
on
the
government's
position.
i
didn't
comment
in
my
opening
remarks
on
the
use
restriction
alternative
suggestion
that
the
government
makes
and
i
won't
dwell
on
it
in
depth
now.
i
had
set
out
fairly
and
comprehensively
in
all
of
our
briefs.
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
mention
of
the
comment
of
mr.
justice
harlan
regarding
section
6107.
i
think
that's
very
informative
on
the
government's
alternative
argument
because
the
government
admits
in
effect
that
that
section
stands
in
the
way
of
their
alternative
argument
that
they
argued
to
the
court,
well,
until
we
can
get
the
internal
revenue
service
to
get
congress
to
amend
that
we'll
sort
of
ignore
it.
they
can
of
course
represent
that
they'll
ignore
a
law
of
congress
but
they'll
--
it's
very
malleable
on
the
government's
position
and
i
think
that
the
point
that
was
raised
in
regard
to
section
6107
demonstrate
to
some
extent
the
inability
of
the
use
of
the
use
restriction
alternative
argument
that
the
government
advanced.
the
government
also
made
reference
to
fear
of
conjure
circle
which
is
the
word
used
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
sullivan
case.
and
i
think
as
its
reliance
on
that
is
based
primarily
on
the
statement
mr.
beytagh
made
immediately
before
that
if
i've
heard
him
correctly.
he
said,
“no
one
will
really
know
if
you
had
a
proper
privilege
or
not.”
but
that
certainly
is
no
problem
in
this
area
like
in
albertson
where
the
area
is
so
saturated
with
criminal
conduct.
my
only
other
remark
before
closing
cause
perhaps
i
thought
i
might
shed
a
little
bit
of
light
on
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
white
was
talking
about.
as
i
understand
the
situation
i
think
there's
no
question
if
the
income
tax
can
be
paid
so
as
not
to
identify
its
source
but
and
this
very
important
for
the
large
volume
of
voluntary
compliance
and
the
large
amount
of
legal
activity
in
this
country
in
the
income
tax
context.
if
taxpayer
wants
any
deductions
or
if
the
taxpayer
wants
any
exemptions,
if
he
has
eployees
there
must
be
disclosures
regarding
that.
but
if
an
illegal
--
if
a
person
involved
in
illegal
activity
pays
the
tax
on
his
gross
income
and
claims
nothing,
as
i
understand
the
procedure
and
as
the
government
concedes
this
can
be
done
anonymously.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
(inaudible)versus
california?
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
might
your
honor.
it's
on
the
periphery
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
of
this
area.
but
the
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
it's
not
this
case
and
i
mentioned
this
to
show
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
as
the
latter
and
perhaps
too
strongly
that
because
it's
conceded
by
united
states
in
this
particular
case.
but
i
think
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
that's
the
way
it
will
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
but
i
think
the
important
point
that
this
all
--
guy's
home
is
that
when
united
states
wants
money
and
that's
what
they
really
want,
there
are
ways
that
which
they
can
collect
their
money
without
making
the
privilege
vendor
accommodate.
and
for
all
these
reasons
and
for
the
reasons
i
advanced
in
the
briefs,
i
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
court
below.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
faces
a
one
year
prison
sentence
and
a
$10,000
fine
for
failure
to
purchase
a
$50
wagering
tax
stamp
and
for
failure
to
register
as
one
engaged
in
the
business
of
gambling.
this
case
presents
for
reevaluation
against
fifth
amendment
objection,
the
constitutionality
of
the
wagering
tax
laws
which
this
court
upheld
in
united
state
versus
kahriger
and
in
lewis
versus
the
united
states.
petitioner
was
convicted
on
two
indictments
in
the
district
of
connecticut,
one
with
the
conspiracy
indictment
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
fail
to
pay
the
$50
tax
stamp.
the
substantive
indictment
charged
two
counts,
failure
to
pay
the
$50
tax
stamp
and
failure
to
register.
at
the
trial
level,
the
motion
which
raised
the
constitutional
issues
presented
by
this
petition
we're
denied
without
opinion
by
chief
judge
timbers
of
the
district
of
connecticut.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
resting
their
decisions
squarely
on
this
court's
decisions
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
two
weeks
after,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case,
this
court
determines
the
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board
decision.
and
on
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
in
the
court
below,
the
second
circuit
noted
that
the
albertson
case
may
have
effect
on
the
continued
validity
of
kahriger
and
lewis
but
decided
that
it
was
best
for
this
court
to
determine
what
effect
that
might
have.
the
petition
for
a
certiorari
in
this
case
was
granted
last
monday,
and
we
can
go
yesterday
and
it's
been
set
down
for
argument
at
this
time,
previously
the
issue
had
been
raised
in
costello
versus
united
states,
number
41.
but
because
of
the
death
of
costello,
this
case
was
substituted.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
my
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
these
were
codefendants
in
the
same
case.
my
issue
as
originally
filed
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
somewhat
different,
but
this
court's
order
reaffirmed
the
issue
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
exactly
as
it
was
in
costello.
so
that
the
issue
was
here
squarely
raising
the
constitutionality
of
the
wagering
tax
laws
as
originally
framed
in
the
costello
grant
of
certiorari.
there
are
also
pending,
several
other
cases
arising
out
of
the
same
series
of
grades
in
connecticut.
the
wagering
tax
statutes
involved
should
be
examined
not
as
you
--
and
not
as
individual
sections
but
perhaps
as
a
unit.
and
i
will
point
out
basically
what
the
statutes
provide.
section
4401
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
10%
excised
tax
on
anyone
engaged
in
the
business
of
gambling.
this
i
should
point
out
as
a
tax
on
gross
wagers.
section
44
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
is
in
the
next
case
grosso
against
united
states.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
feel
however
that
the
scheme
of
the
statutes
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
to
have
meaning
must
be
put
in
context.
that
section
directly
--
is
involved
for
the
first
time
in
the
next
case.
the
section
4411
which
is
directly
involved
here
is
the
provision
which
requires
the
purchase
of
$50
wagering
tax
stamp.
and
section
4412
which
is
also
directly
involved
here
is
the
section
that
requires
the
registration
in
giving
of
information
concerning
the
operation
of
the
gambling
business.
it's
appropriate
i
think
also
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
form,
form
11-c
and
supplemental
form
11-c
which
implement
section
4412.
rounding
out
the
statutory
scheme
but
not
directly
involved
as
are
4411
and
4412,
our
section
6011
which
authorizes
the
secretary
to
com
--
require
the
completion
of
forms,
such
as
form
11-c
which
i'll
go
into
more
in
detail.
and
also
there
is
section
4422
which
requires
the
payment
--
that
payment
shall
not
in
any
way
eliminate
other
penalties
which
may
be
provided.
section
4423
provides
that
books
and
records
of
the
gambling
operation
can
be
examined
by
the
secretary
and
section
4906
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
eliminations
of
state
penalties
because
of
this.
the
payment
of
the
tax
involved
in
this
case
if
your
honors
please,
cannot
be
made
without
the
registration
required
by
section
4412.
at
the
very
least,
the
payment
of
the
tax
represents
an
admission
that
the
proposed
taxpayer
is
in
that
class
of
people
who
are
obligated
and
liable
for
the
excised
tax
under
4401.
and
the
registration
requirements
require
even
additional
information
regarding
that
aspect
to
the
gambling
business.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
if
your
honor
please.
the
registration
form
is
in
the
record
after
page
6.
the
government
has
appended
to
its
brief
an
additional
form
bearing
the
same
number
but
a
different
effective
date
which
--
it
contends
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
there
was
no
new
record
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
published
for
this
case.
it
bares
number
41
probably
on
your
--
it
was
originally
number
826
from
my
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
--
the
form
in
the
record
of
the
costello
case
at
page
6
is
the
form
that
was
in
used
in
connecticut
when
the
--
at
the
time
involved
in
this
case.
an
additional
form,
which
we
submit
does
not
in
anyway
modify
the
constitutional
implication,
is
the
next
as
an
appendix
to
government's
brief
filed
in
the
costello
case
also.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
not
solely
prospective
if
you
please
mr.
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
i
think
perhaps
i
could
point
out
in
a
word
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
question
5
now
reads,
“are
you
or
will
you
be
engaged?”
they
added
the
words
“will
you
be
engaged”.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
right.
the
“will
you
be
receiving
wagers”
was
added
in
the
63
form.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
by
the
form
annexed
to
appendix.
of
this
entire
statutory
scheme
involved
here,
the
commissioner
in
--
of
internal
revenue
in
1962
have
this
to
say
and
i
think
it's
quiet
significant.
the
dilemma
of
the
bookmaker
is
apparent.
if
he
registers
and
pays
the
wagering
taxes,
he
is
generating
evidence
of
his
gambling
activities,
evidence
that
is
available
to
local
authorities.
if
he
does
not
register,
he
exposes
himself
to
the
sanctions
and
penalties
and
contained
in
the
federal
wagering
tax
laws.
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
in
the
lewis
case
over
10
years
ago,
if
this
scheme
does
not
violate
the
privilege,
it's
very
difficult
to
think
of
any
thing
that
would
violate
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
for
these
two
decisions
of
kahriger
and
lewis,
it
seems
clear
that
the
fifth
amendment
violation
here
is
obvious
on
the
phase
both
in
terms
of
incriminating
a
potential
taxpayer
under
federal
law
and
under
state
law.
i
think
the
central
question
then
for
the
court
is,
what
then
is
the
basis
for
kahriger
and
lewis
which
justified
the
result
reached
there?
those
two
decisions
really
stand
on
two
pegs.
the
first
is
hardly
at
issue
anymore
for
reasons
that
i
will
explain.
it
was
the
notion
suggested
in
both
of
the
kahriger
and
lewis
dates
--
cases
that
since
the
petitioner
had
not
purchased
the
tax
stamp
he
couldn't
rely
on
the
privilege.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
albertson
last
term
fairly
clearly
set
that
to
rest
then
i
should
point
out
that
the
government
in
its
brief
does
not
even
claim
to
the
contrary.
so
the
real
issue
in
the
case
is,
what
is
the
foundation
that
has
continuing
merit
in
kahriger
and
lewis
if
any?
the
court
said
in
kahriger
and
lewis,
that
the
wagering
tax
law
is
prospective
and
only
--
and
one
need
not
go
ahead
and
gamble.
therefore,
there
is
nothing
compulsory.
and
i
think
if
there
is
an
examination
in
detail
of
this
concept,
and
i
point
out
that
in
both
kahriger
and
lewis
there
were
many
other
issues
beside
fifth
amendment
issues.
and
the
fifth
amendment
discussion
in
these
cases
was
very
brief.
what
then
is
the
basis
for
this
notion
of
prospective
application?
and
how
does
it
really
apply?
i
urge
the
court's
attention
to
form
11-c
which
is
in
the
record
as
already
pointed
out.
the
questions
asked,
and
i'm
speaking
now
the
form
as
it
existed
at
the
time
involved
in
this
case.
are
you
engaged
--
among
other
questions,
are
you
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
on
your
own
account?
that's
one
question,
another
is,
"do
you
receive
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
some
other
person
or
persons?"
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
extremely
difficult
to
say,
that
answering
those
questions
as
framed
in
applying
regular
concepts
of
interpretation
means
that
there's
any
thing
in
the
future
about
those
questions.
because
the
question
is
specifically
in
the
past
tense,
“are
you
engaged
in
the
business?”,
and
“do
you
receive
wagers?”
there's
nothing
prospective
about
it.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
we
submit
your
honor
that
even
in
nevada,
there
would
be.
if
this
court
adheres
to
the
so-called
link
in
the
chain
doctrine
of
the
privilege
that
was
established
before
these
cases
and
after
these
cases,
and
that
there
are
several
federal
related
to
gambling
offenses
such
as
interstate
transportation
of
gambling
data.
federal
offenses
which
were
not
on
--
some
of
which
were
not
on
the
books
at
the
time
of
kahriger
and
lewis.
so
even
then,
these
questions
could
very
well
provide
an
investigatory
lead
to
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
i
think
it
has
widespread
application
to
the
states,
except
nevada
course
which
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
as
long
as
the
federal
antigambling
type
law
still
remain.
and
those
--
i
think
that
perhaps
the
best
example
is
the
united
states
against
zizzo
which
is
cited
in
my
brief
where
it
was
--
the
defendant
was
charged
with
violation
of
certain
provisions
of
the
antiracketeering
section,
a
federal
offense.
and
the
wagering
tax
stamp
was
admitted
in
over
his
objection
as
evidenced
against
him
in
the
--
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor,
except
that
it
does
show
that
there
is
definite
and
concrete
fear
of
incrimination
from
a
federal
law
as
well
as
from
the
state,
solely
state
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
we
have
a
problem
in
the
income
tax
of
course
that
does
not
arise
here.
i
think
it
was
really
emphasized
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
albertson
situation
where
the
forms
do
not
zero-in
on
an
activity
that
is
illegal
in
itself.
for
example,
the
income
tax
--
i
do
not
contend
and
perhaps
this
is
the
best
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
i
do
not
contend
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
could
not
pay
his
federal
income
taxes
even
though
they
were
derived
from
the
same
source,
even
though
i
further
contend
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
pay
the
$50
wagering
tax
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
think
the
scope
depends
on
whether
or
not
it's
an
area
as
your
--
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
albertson
where
there
is
an
area
perminated
by
criminal
laws
primarily.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
that
would
fall
within
that
category.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
oh,
he
could
not
refuse
to
make
any
--
it
depends
on
what
type
of
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
the
tax
were
designed
--
if
the
tax
related
to
an
industry
or
a
business
which
was
in
effect
outlawed,
i
think
then
the
principles
of
this
case
come
into
play.
in
other
words,
i
make
no
contention
that
the
petitioner
need
not
pay
his
income
tax
on
the
same
very
activity.
or
that
he
can
fail
to
file
his
federal
income
tax
return,
because
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
if
the
government
chooses
your
honor
to
place
a
tax
on
an
activity
that
is
fundamentally
illegal,
then
i
think
they
run
the
risk
of
the
privilege
intercepting
that
tax.
for
example,
one
of
the
example
cited
by
the
commentators
in
discussing
kahriger
and
lewis
is,
if
there
would've
be
a
law
passed
that
all
burglars
must
register
with
the
united
states,
even
though
there's
no
federal
anti-burglar
law,
that
would
run
a
file
or
the
privilege.
and
i
think
that
the
point
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
is,
that
this
notion
of
prospectiveness
in
kahriger
and
lewis
really
doesn't
salvage
them
from
the
sound
objections
of
the
privilege.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
there
you
come
closer
to
the
income
tax
situation
if
your
honor
please,
whereby
if
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
objection
it
has
to
be
focused
in
a
more
narrow
point.
whereas
here,
we
invalid
the
statute
on
its
face
we
submit
that
violates
the
privilege.
i
did
want
to
emphasize
however
that
we
don't
claim
that
anyone
engaged
in
this
activity
has
a
right
not
to
file
an
income
tax
return.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
your
honor,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
would
maintain
that
that
in
itself
would
violate
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
purchase
of
the
stamp,
at
the
very
best
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
represents
an
admission
or
a
declaration
that
i
intend
to
engage
in
the
business
of
gambling.
and
the
cases
in
the
state
that
have
arisen
which
i've
cited
in
our
brief
which
is
really
a
reply
brief
to
the
costello
situation,
demonstrate
that
it
can
be
used
for
that
very
purpose.
in
a
case
arising
in
tennessee,
it
was
shown
in
a
conspiracy
case
that
the
stamp
had
purchased.
in
one
case,
that's
mentioned
at
page
9
on
my
brief,
it
was
shown
for
that
specific
purpose
to
show
intent
so
that
the
way
this
is
framed
even
the
payment
of
the
$50
in
itself
would
--
be
violative
of
the
privilege
if
your
honor
please.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
i
assumed
your
honor's
hypothesis,
they
cannot
be
isolated.
the
cases
of
the
lower
courts
interpreting
in
the
regulations
insist
that
the
registration
be
made
at
the
time
the
$50
is
tendered.
in
one
case,
the
$50
was
tendered.
the
government
refused
the
$50
because
the
taxpayer
wouldn't
register.
they
then
prosecuted
the
taxpayer
criminally
for
failure
to
have
him
pay
the
$50.
he
plead
as
a
defense
that
he
tried
to
pay
the
$50
and
he
would
--
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
what?
your
honor
that
is
a
technical
choice
but
if
they
propose
taxpayer
is
honest
and
obeys
the
command
of
the
law,
it
now
says
what
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
pardon.
assuming
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
said
that
he
has
no
real
choice
but
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
pardon.
i
didn't
hear
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor,
within
the
concept
of
this
law.
i
think
once
he's
had
the
intent
to
engage
in
the
business
of
gambling,
he
must
register.
and
therefore,
he
has
no
real
choice
to
discontinue.
there
is
a
very
excellent
comment
i
think
on
that
precise
point
mr.
justice
white
which
came
out
last
friday
after
i
have
written
my
brief,
it's
by
professor
john
mansfield
of
the
harvard
law
school
and
its
in
the
new
edition
of
the
supreme
court
review,
and
it
states
this.
“in
the
opinion
in
the
lewis
case,
it
is
stated
as
relevant
to
the
validity
of
the
wagering
tax
registration
requirement
that
the
petitioner
had
no
constitutional
right
to
gamble.
of
course,
he
had
no
right
to
gamble.
that
is
to
say
he
could
be
punished
for
the
act
of
gambling.
but
the
question
is
whether
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
to
impose
upon
the
activity
of
gambling,
punishment,
not
only
for
engaging
in
this
activity
but
such
further
in
particular
burdens
as
arise
from
requiring
disclosure
of
an
intention
to
gamble”.
that
i
think
that
--
the
statement
in
kahriger
and
the
statement
in
lewis
or
rather
the
statement
in
lewis,
that
suggest
that
you
can
always
avoid
this
dilemma
by
just
abandoning
your
notion
to
gamble.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
but
that
of
course
is
not
the
way
tax
now
reads.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
could
be
used
at
any
rate
if
their
--
if
you
were
required
to
register
at
all
as
a
lead
for
past
activities
also.
so
that
it's
not
completely
--
it's
not
completely
perspective.
in
other
words,
if
you
had
been
engaging
in
the
activity
of
gambling
and
decided
to
abandon
that
activity,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
haven't
yet.
but
i
--
i'm
about
come
to
that
and
then
i
think
that
--
that
it
clearly
is
a
violation
under
fifth
amendment,
even
if
it
is
wholly
prospective.
but
that
its
--
the
argument
for
reversal
here
is
not
dependent
upon
that.
i
think
that
the
supplemental
form
now
called
for
a
--
under
the
statutory
scheme
is
clearly
retrospective.
for
example,
there
is
a
requirement
that
10
days
after
you
have
additional
employees,
you
must
relate
their
names
to
the
commissioner.
in
that
situation
then,
it
is
absolutely
a
passed
act
that
is
being
recorded
and
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
applicability
of
it.
perhaps
one
other
face
of
the
weakness
in
kahriger
and
lewis
can
be
demonstrated
by
a
reference
to
united
states
versus
calamaro
in
which
this
case
decided
that
certain
activities
need
not
register.
for
example,
a
runner
in
the
numbers
business
who
did
not
have
the
requisite
proprietary
interest
may
not
have
had
to
register.
but
if
he
were
to
be
elevated
in
the
gambling
business
and
register
and
assuming
that
it
only
applied
prospectively,
then
if
your
honor
please,
it
could
be
used
as
a
lead
to
engage
to
--
bring
about
a
trial
of
the
activities
prohibited
by
the
state.
so
it
seems
that
there
is
really
under
a
keen
analysis
of
the
kahriger
and
lewis
cases,
nothing
that
has
withstood
more
recent
decisions
along
this
area
of
the
law.
the
government
--
its
position
does
restate
the
kahriger
and
lewis
positions.
that
i
cannot
deny.
it
does
not
however
justify
the
underlying
principle.
i
think
its
well
to
point
out
that
in
kahriger
and
in
lewis,
there
was
no
discussion
whatsoever
of
the
older
principles
which
had
been
emphasized
both
before
and
after
that
if
a
information
will
lead
to
an
investigation
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
the
fifth
amendment
for
its
protection.
that
whole
concept
which
is
so
important
to
this
court's
thinking
in
recent
cases,
was
not
even
discussed
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
i
think
that
the
albertson
decision
which
was
handed
down
last
term
when
compared
to
the
kahriger
decision
and
the
lewis
decision,
demonstrates
the
self-incriminatory
nature
of
the
things
that
would
--
which
we
are
here
concerned.
and
this
is
so
i
believe,
even
if
the
comparison
is
made
to
the
new
form
that
the
government
injected
in
this
case
at
this
time.
incidentally
at
the
time
that
the
government
opposed
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
new
form
was
not
been
available.
so
i
think
the
only
form
that
it's
really
an
issue
in
the
case
is
the
form
that
was
annexed
in
the
record
and
which
is
part
of
the
record.
but
the
--
assuming
for
a
moment
the
applicability
of
the
new
form
which
is
annexed
to
the
government's
brief
and
comparing
it
to
the
form
which
this
court
appended
to
its
opinion
in
albertson,
it
just
seems
like
here
as
there,
they
used
the
words
“the
court”,
the
self-incriminatory
nature
of
the
inquiry
is
obvious.
the
first
question
involves
the
name.
the
first
question
in
the
other
--
in
the
tax
form
in
--
asked
for
the
name
and
also
asked
for
the
aliases,
much
as
the
form
in
the
communist
registration
provision.
the
form
5
which
is
one
of
the
key
bits
of
information
that
the
government
wrote
--
6
in
form
11-c,
specifically
ask
for
the
number
of
employees
or
agents
engaged
in
receiving
wagers
on
your
behalf.
there
is
therefore,
nothing
prospective
their.
so
comparing
these
two
forms
together
if
your
honor
please,
it
seems
clear
that
kahriger
and
lewis
cannot
withstand
the
test
of
the
albertson
decision.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
change
if
your
honor
please,
relates
to
paragraphs
5
and
6
of
the
new
form
11-c.
it
now
says,
“are
you
or
will
you
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers?”
that
word,
“will
you
be
engaged
in
the
business”,
was
added.
and
the
next
question
6
said,
"do
you
receive
or
will
you
be
receiving
wagers?”
the
phrase,
“will
you
be
receiving
wagers”
is
the
words
that
--
are
the
words
that
were
added.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
one
more
block
in
the
kahriger-lewis
foundation
i
believe
deserves
mention.
in
the
kahriger
case
the
court
said,
the
privilege
has
relation
to
past
acts
only
and
not
to
future
acts
that
may
or
may
not
occur.
this
we
think
is
basically
unsound
in
this
context.
first
of
all,
it
came
solely
from
a
citation
in
wigmore
and
the
background
material
in
wigmore
demonstrates
that
it
really
has
no
application
to
this
context.
for
what
wigmore
was
talking
about
were
occupation
such
as
--
and
this
are
the
examples
he
mentioned
pawn
brokers
and
drugers
who
had
to
refer
to
certain
licensing
and
reporting
obligations.
nothing
of
the
nature
here
involved
where
the
activity
is
so
fundamentally
illegal.
i
think
another
aspect
to
this
that
varies
mentioned
is
that
no
court
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
kahriger
in
any
way
stood
and
upheld
the
principle
that
is
born
out
in
the
wigmore
generalization.
so
the
recent
cases
of
this
court
if
your
honor
please,
undercut
the
foundations
of
kahriger
and
lewis.
the
government
offers
no
basis
to
show
how
these
rationales
of
kahriger
and
lewis
are
consistent
with
the
doctrine
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
it's
now
known.
i'm
well
aware
of
course
that
the
members
of
the
court
have
been
decided
on
certain
issues
relating
to
the
fifth
amendment
divided
on
certain
issues
related
to
the
fifth
amendment.
but
nothing
in
the
recent
disents
in
garrity
and
spevack
or
malloy,
suggest
that
there's
any
vitality
left
to
the
kahriger
and
lewis
cases.
from
a
common
practical
everyday
point
of
view,
what
do
we
have
with
this
tax?
we
have
a
wagering
tax
which
the
united
states
says,
cannot
pay
for
itself.
in
other
words,
it
cost
more
to
enforce
it
than
it
nets
the
government.
and
we
have
it
working
as
a
squeezing
device
on
the
citizens.
the
citizen
has
the
choice
to
comply
or
to
defy
the
wagering
tax
law.
if
he
complies
with
the
wagering
tax
law,
he
puts
himself
in
a
state
jail.
if
he
defies
the
wagering
tax
law,
he
puts
himself
into
a
federal
jail.
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
this
is
fundamentally
opposed
to
the
whole
concept
of
the
fifth
amendment.
almost
as
if
in
accord
with
that
notion,
the
government
spends
very
little
time
attempting
to
bolster
kahriger
and
lewis.
what
the
government
does
if
your
honors
please,
is
offer
to
this
court
as
an
alternative,
the
suggestion
that
there
need
not
be
invalidation
of
these
tax
statutes.
what
does
the
government
say?
the
government
says
assuming
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutionally
violative
of
the
privilege.
there
is
no
need
here
to
uphold
the
traditional
right
to
silence
which
is
the
backbone
of
the
fifth
amendment.
rather
says
the
government,
“leave
the
tax
statute
standing
but
exclude
from
evidence
anything
that
comes
from
the
tax
laws
so
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
incrimination
in
the
future.”
what
the
government
then
says
is
we
must
have
an
exclusionary
rule,
down
with
the
concept
of
silence
which
is
so
fundamental
with
the
fifth
amendment
right
and
up
with
the
concept
of
an
exclusionary
rule.
as
a
basis
for
this
rule,
the
government
relies
almost
exclusively
on
murphy
versus
the
waterfront.
and
i
think
that
that
case
must
be
put
in
context
to
show
why
the
exclusionary
rule
that
the
government
relies
upon
has
no
real
application.
in
the
murphy
case
if
your
honor
please,
the
concept
of
dual
sovereignty
was
overturned
by
this
court.
after
that
was
done,
the
court
then
faced
this
problem
and
it
said
it
quite
specifically,
we
must
now
decide
what
effect
our
abandonment
of
dual
sovereignty
has
on
the
state
immunity
statute.
for
in
the
murphy
case,
unlike
situation
in
the
case
at
bar
there
were
state
immunity
statutes
involved.
the
witnesses
had
been
afforded
immunity
by
the
states
of
new
jersey
and
the
state
of
new
york
which
were
there
involved.
so
the
sole
issue
in
the
case
involved
in
murphy
was
how
do
we
rule
in
connection
with
the
immunity
statute.
the
court
had
two
alternatives
that
faced
it.
if
the
court
would
have
said,
“alright,
we
will
uphold
the
traditional
right
to
silence”,
which
is
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
would
have
in
effect
invalidated
all
state
immunity
statutes
because
it
was
fundamental
that
the
states
could
not
extend
immunity
from
federal
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
would
have
expanded
the
doctrine
of
immunity,
it
would
have
run
completely
afoul
with
the
supremacy
clause
since
its
fundamental
where
the
states
cannot
extend
to
federal
prosecution,
immunity
from
prosecution.
so
the
result
in
that
peculiar
circumstances
where
immunity
statutes
were
an
issue
was
to
fashion
this
exclusionary
rule.
but
the
exclusionary
rule
has
no
application
here
because
of
the
lack
of
the
immunity
legislation.
i
think
perhaps
the
case
that
most
clearly
demonstrates
this
is
malloy
versus
hogan,
decided
the
very
day
as
murphy.
in
the
malloy
case,
there
was
no
immunity
statute
and
the
court
upheld
the
traditional
right
to
silence
in
reversing
and
they
did
not
fashion
an
immunity
statute.
so
for
these
reasons
if
your
honor
please,
we
think
that
the
immunity
alternative,
immunity
from
use,
that
the
government
proposes
is
not
a
meaningful
one
and
that
the
traditional
right
to
silence
in
this
fifth
amendment
area
should
be
upheld.
we
think
that
kahriger
and
lewis
were
wrongly
decided
and
that
recent
decisions
of
this
court
clearly
emphasize
that.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
know
of
no
statistical
summaries
of
that
nature
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
government
may
have
some
private
information
to
that
effect.
i
would
however
point
out
the
court
at
page
7
of
my
brief,
i
have
catalogued
some
of
the
cases,
a
good
number
of
them
where
the
subsequent
state
conviction
was
predicated
at
least
in
part
upon
the
compliance
with
the
federal
wagering
tax
laws.
and
there
they're
listed
as
i
count
them
about
10
or
12
convictions.
i
have
no
doubt
that
that's
used
widely
in
--
throughout
the
country.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
have
just
a
few
comments
in
reply
if
your
honor
please.
the
government
charges
that
we're
looking
for
some
sort
of
protective
status
from
mr.
marchetti
because
he's
engaged
in
the
gambling
business.
that's
not
so.
what
this
case
really
boils
down
to
is
we're
asking
that
mr.
marchetti
in
bridgeport,
connecticut,
is
it
required
to
answer
the
question,
are
you
engaged
in
an
illegal
activity?
and
i
think
that
we're
not
asking
for
something
of
special
import.
it
is
pointed
out
quite
clearly
perhaps
in
a
footnote
in
the
government's
brief.
footnote
25
--
i'm
sorry,
footnote
21,
page
22
of
the
government
brief,
where
the
government
says,
“we
recognize
that
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
the
matters
here
involved,
registration
and
filing
of
a
wagering
tax
return
and
the
filing
of
an
income
tax
return.”
this
is
so,
because
the
income
tax
return
permits
reporting
of
the
income
without
specific
identification
of
source.
and
we
think
that
distinction
which
they
concede
is
crucial
and
undermines
their
claim
that
we're
asking
for
a
protective
status
of
any
kind.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
not
really
--
that
is
not
--
it
is
--
the
government's
concession
is
correct
your
honor.
for
this
reason,
there
are
not
the
collateral
penalties
involved
if
you
do
not
fill
in
all
the
same
information
in
1040
as
there
are
if
you
don't
fill
any
information
here.
that
--
as
i
understand,
and
i
maybe
wrong
in
this,
if
you
offer
the
united
states
$10,000
in
income
tax,
they'll
take
it.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
you
offer
them
$50
to
buy
a
stamp
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
they
will
not
take
it
though,
if
you're
unpleased.
if
you
offer
them
$50
to
buy
a
stamp,
they
will
not
take
it
anonymously.
that's
--
i
think
an
important
thing,
they're
not
out
for
anonymous
collection
of
income
as
they
are
in
the
income
tax
situation.
i
think
one
other
point
merit
some
consideration
and
it
relates
to
inquiries
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
chief
justice
suggested
for
--
that
the
government
was
perhaps
proposing
some
kind
of
confidentiality
as
the
alternative
remedy
in
this
case.
what
the
government
ignores
to
comment
i
think
is
on
section
6107,
which
is
very
important
part
of
the
same
act.
in
the
principle
internal
revenue
office
in
each
internal
revenue
district,
there
shall
be
kept
for
public
inspection
an
alphabetical
list
of
names
of
all
persons
who
had
paid
special
taxes
under
this
subtitle
so
there's
no
concept
here
of
confidentiality.
in
fact,
there's
a
congressional
intent
to
the
opposite.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that's
the
wagering
tax
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
this
section
that
i
read
your
honor
refers
to
the
wagering
tax
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
it
may
apply
to
a
few
other
special
taxes
but
it's
in
this
section,
its
6107
of
title
26.
if
your
honor
please,
that
brings
us
to
the
related
issue
of
this
nonuse
rule
that
mr.
justice
fortas
touched
upon.
the
government
would
not
quite
say,
at
least
if
they
did
say
it
orally,
they
were
modifying
their
position
in
the
brief
that
they
were
advocating
a
nonuse
rule.
because
by
nonuse,
i
believe
mr.
justice
fortas
had
in
mind
an
immunity
situation
and
the
government
will
not
concede
that
in
their
brief.
they're
very
strong
to
emphasize
that
they
have
no
objection
to
mr.
marchetti
being
prosecuted
but
when
a
state
prosecutor
introduces
evidence
a,
we
then
object
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
a
and
we
say
the
united
states
must
have
given
you
this
information,
that's
where
you
got
it
and
therefore
it
must
be
excluded.
that's
the
only
rule
the
government
would
offer
us
now.
i
say
your
honor
that
is
no
substitute
for
the
right
to
remain
silent
which
is
really
the
cornerstone
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
before
these
reasons
your
honor,
i
should
add
one
more
thought
on
this
point
your
honor.
even
assuming
arguendo
that
there
were
some
adoption
by
this
court
of
the
murphy
type
rule,
which
as
i
said
in
my
main
argument,
it
has
no
application
whatsoever
when
there's
no
state
immunity
statute
at
issue
and
there's
none
here.
there
would
still
be
no
basis
to
affirm
these
convictions
because
the
court
just
as
it
did
in
murphy
should
afford
an
opportunity
to
have
the
petitioner
know
the
rule
that
is
now
being
enacted.
in
murphy
for
example,
the
convictions
were
reversed
as
the
court
announced
the
new
rule.
and
the
same
if
murphy
word
to
be
applied
to
this
situation,
the
same
remedy
must
apply
and
the
convictions
under
all
circumstances
must
be
reversed.
for
all
of
these
reasons
therefore
your
honor
i
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
understand
the
solicitor
general
passed
a
preliminary
motion
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
for
the
second
time
with
additional
questions
having
been
propounded
by
the
court
last
term
after
argument.
considering
the
responses
of
the
government
to
those
questions
and
setting
to
one
side
some
of
the
finer
refinements
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
the
central
crucial
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
this
petitioner
can
be
fined
thousand
dollars
and
sent
to
prison
for
a
year
for
failing
to
answer
the
following
questions
in
connection
with
the
wagering
tax
laws.
among
those
questions
are;
are
you
engaged
in
business
of
accepting
wagers
on
your
own
account
and
do
you
receive
wagers
for
or
on
behalf
of
other
person
or
persons.
to
put
the
wagering
tax
laws
in
context
and
to
understand
the
group
upon
which
this
laws
call
for
such
responses,
i
thought
it
might
be
appropriate
to
consider
seven
groups
in
the
general
gambling
community.
in
the
first
group,
if
your
honors
please,
might
be
the
sweepstakes
operators
such
as
the
new
hampshire
sweepstakes.
in
the
second
circumstance,
set
of
circumstances
might
be
the
casino
operators
of
las
vegas
of
which
we
are
all
familiar
with,
the
posh
casinos
and
the
games
of
roulette,
craps,
stud
poker,
black
jack,
bingo,
what
have
you?
in
the
third
group,
we
could
place
the
parimutuel
operators
at
the
large
race
tracks
throughout
the
eastern
sea
board.
and
then
in
another
group
what
i
call
the
fourth
group
might
be
the
bingo
group,
numerous
small
games
of
this
quality
throughout
the
country.
in
the
fifth
group
we
could
have
church
lotteries
and
raffles
and
in
the
sixth
group,
the
friendly
pool
on
the
world
series
in
the
office
of
a
large
law
firm
or
any
other
office
which
is
so
common
throughout
the
country.
the
seventh
and
last
group
might
include
the
bookmaker
and
the
pool
selling
operator
and
it
is
that
seventh
group
only
if
this
court
please,
upon
which
the
wagering
tax
laws
operate.
i
think
if
there's
one
though
i'd
like
to
leave
with
the
court
today,
it
would
that
i
would
like
to
dispel
the
notion
that
gambling
is
gradually
becoming
legalized.
in
las
vegas
we
have
legalized
gambling
and
we
have
sweepstakes
and
we
have
bingo,
we
have
various
forms
of
gambling
that's
generally
becoming
a
neutral
activity.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
a
neutral
non-criminal
activity
mixed
with
the
--
neutral
used
in
the
sense
of
the
albertson
case,
if
your
honor
please.
i
think
that's
the
notion
that
i
would
like
to
dispel
because
this
case
operates
and
the
taxes
imposed
by
this
case
operate
only
on
the
seventh
group
that
i
mentioned,
the
illegal
--
essentially
on
the
seventh
group
i
mentioned,
the
illegal
bookmaker
activity.
the
act
by
special
definition
excludes
the
sweepstakes
and
also
excludes
parimutuel
betting
and
it
also
excludes
the
gambling
casinos
of
las
vegas
not
specifically
but
that
type
of
gambling
activity
by
the
manner
in
which
way
during
is
defined
in
the
act.
if
you're
dealing
with
an
activity
where
the
contestants
play
in
the
presence
of
each
other
and
all
the
winners
are
determined
in
the
presence
of
each
other
such
as
roulette,
or
craps
at
one
the
casinos,
that
activity
is
specifically
defined
out
of
the
way
during
tax
laws.
so
i
think
then
we
have
a
situation
clearly
within
this
courts
pronouncement
in
the
albertson
case
that
where
--
have
a
tax
directed
to
a
group
which
is
primarily
involved
in
criminal
activity
and
which
is
inherently
criminal.
i
think
the
notion
that
i
would
like
to
dispel
is
that
its
not.
as
i
said
before,
it's
not
an
activity
where
there's
mostly
illegal
activity
and
that
we
can't
let
the
states
bin
this
label
of
illegality
to
this
conduct
so
as
to
thwart
the
revenues.
now,
of
course
we
would
consider
the
group
upon
which
the
tax
works.
it's
important
and
necessary
to
consider
how
the
tax
actually
functions.
under
the
leading
section
of
the
act
which
is
more
directly
involved
in
the
next
case
that
professor
rightful
discussed,
there's
a
10%
tax
on
wagers
as
i've
defined
it
to
you.
then,
there
must
be
a
$50
stamp
purchased
under
section
4411
and
in
conjunction
with
that
stamp
a
detailed
questionnaire
must
be
filed
with
the
internal
revenue
service.
as
i
started
to
point
out
a
moment
ago
that
questionnaire
is
in
form
11-c
which
is
annexed
to
my
supplemental
brief.
it
asked
for
the
taxpayer's
full
name,
all
aliases,
business
address,
residence
address,
the
name
of
all
of
the
taxpayer's
principals,
the
name
of
all
the
taxpayers'
employees.
and
it
requires
that
this
information
must
be
filed
at
the
time
the
$50
wagering
tax
stamp
is
purchased.
a
collateral
section
in
the
act
makes
it
mandatory
for
the
person
engaged
in
this
activity
to
keep
track,
keep
a
record
of
every
single
wage
that
he
makes
and
then
section
4423
of
the
code
makes
it
clear
that
this
records
which
have
been
kept
by
every
wager
can
be
inspected
at
the
desire
of
the
internal
revenue
commissioner.
rounding
up
the
statutory
scheme,
your
honors
please,
there
are
provisions
which
say
specifically
that
payment
of
this
tax
does
not
excuse
the
taxpayer
from
any
violation
of
state
law
or
federal
law
and
it
also
specifically
provides
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
if
we
would
have
bought
the
tax,
would
have
had
under
the
mandatory
provisions
of
the
act,
his
name
and
address
listed
publicly
and
available
for
state
prosecutor.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
congress
specifically
put
in
that
section.
i'm
speaking
of
section
6107
of
the
act.
that
for
a
certain
some
state
prosecutors
can
have
some
certified
copies
of
this
information
that's
been
filed
in
connection
with
the
wagering
tax
laws.
in
addition
to
that,
once
the
stamp
has
been
purchased,
the
taxpayer
must
display
it
prominently
on
his
premises
and
in
conjunction
with
that
point,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
if
he
forgets
in
a
non-willful
manner
to
display
this
there's
also
a
punishment
even
if
it's
just
negligence.
with
this
group
that
i
mentioned
upon
whom
the
tax
works
and
the
what
and
wherefore
of
the
tax
explained,
it
seems
that
once
it
is
recognized
the
nature
of
the
underlying
gambling
activity
in
this
country,
that
the
self-incriminatory
aspects
of
the
tax
as
applied
are
fairly
obvious.
gambling
of
course
and
this
is
conceded
by
the
government
is
illegal
every
place
in
the
united
states
except
in
nevada,
with
exceptions
to
the
specific
things
that
i've
mentioned
most
of
which
are
excluded
from
operation
of
the
way
during
tax
laws
and
since
this
issue
was
originally
resolved
some
fifteen
years
ago
in
the
kahriger
case
over
dissent
and
the
lewis
case
also
over
dissent.
the
federal
government
has
gotten
into
the
picture
considerably
more.
i
have
set
forth
in
our
supplemental
brief
a
list
of
the
various
federal
laws
at
page
7
that
the
united
states
now
comes
in
--
come
into
play
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
although
there
--
some
of
these
weren't
effect
at
the
time
the
court
first
considered
the
wagering
tax
laws.
there
have
been
additional
statutes
added.
so
considering
first
the
group
that
i've
referred
to
and
then
considering
the
how
of
the
act,
how
it
operates
and
the
nature
of
the
activity,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
rely
with
some
confidence
on
this
courts
pronounced,
unanimous
announcement
on
the
albertson
case
that
when
the
activity
is
essentially
permeated,
the
criminal
conduct,
there
is
a
purpose
by
which
the
self-incrimination
clause
can
be
utilized.
and
i
think
malloy
also
comes
into
the
picture
at
this
point
because
malloy
versus
hogan
decided
after
kahriger
and
after
lewis
established
also
that
the
test
to
use
is
whether
or
not
it
can
possibly
result
in
crim
--
in
incrimination.
and
i
think
if
you
measure
the
framework,
measure
the
context,
i
think
the
opposite
result
follows
that
in
the
context
of
this
act
there
cannot
be
anything
but
incrimination
by
the
payment
of
the
wagering
tax
law
--
stamp.
after
the
case
was
here
last
term,
the
court
as
i
mentioned
set
it
down
for
reargument
and
directed
counsel
to
brief
two
additional
questions
which
i'll
discuss
in
just
a
moment.
i
should
perhaps
point
out
that
the
fifth
amendment
argument
upon
which
we
rely
today
was
considered
and
rejected
by
the
district
court
without
opinion.
the
district
court
ruling
was
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board.
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
opinion
written
by
judge
friendly
of
the
second
circuit
considered
the
issue
prior
to
the
rendition
of
the
albertson
case
and
albertson
came
down
i
think
about
fourteen
days
after
the
second
circuit
acted
and
we
promptly
move
for
reargument.
in
that
motion
for
reargument
the
response
of
judge
friendly
was
that
albertson
very
well
may
lead
this
court
to
reconsider
its
rulings
in
kahriger
and
lewis
but
it
felt
that
any
change
in
the
situation
should
come
from
this
court
and
not
from
the
lower
court.
subsequent
to
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
a
companion
case
entitled
the
united
states
versus
costello.
costello
died
before
the
matter
was
heard
and
certiorari
was
granted
in
the
present
case,
in
the
marchetti
case.
in
this
connection
i
should
perhaps
point
out
what
its
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
that
we
are
here
on
the
costello
record
but
that
costello
and
marchetti
were
codefendants
in
the
district
court
and
that
the
record
was
similar
and
there's
no
factual
dispute
on
the
record,
it's
purely
a
matter
of
the
fifth
amendment
applied
to
the
wagering
tax
laws.
as
to
the
two
additional
questions,
if
your
honors
please,
which
was
propounded
by
the
court
last
term,
one
is
whether
or
not
the
required
records
doctrine
of
shapiro
as
any
application
to
this
case
and
the
other,
if
your
honors
please,
is
whether
or
not
the
registration
requirement
of
section
4412
which
is
related
to
form
11-c
that
i
quoted
before
can
be
met
without
--
i'm
sorry,
whether
the
tax
provision
of
4411
can
be
met
without
the
registration
provision
being
complied
with.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
it
was
directed
in
my
case
also
if
your
honor
please
and
the
government
originally
had
concede
that
it
--
that
they
could
not
be
isolated
in
our
case
and
they
had
modified
their
position
in
grosso
to
say
this
comment,
it
also
cannot
be
paid
without
compliance
with
the
registration
in
the
grosso
case.
as
to
the
required
records
doctrine
and
as
to
the
additional
question
concerning
the
payment,
if
the
court
please,
the
government
and
petitioner
essentially
in
agreement.
i
think
perhaps
the
best
summary
of
the
government's
position
is
contained
in
the
original
brief
at
page
25.
the
government
stated
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
presently
to
consider
any
possible
relationship
between
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
the
so-called
required
records
doctrine
in
shapiro
versus
united
states.
no
such
issue
is
involved
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
government
reaffirmed
that
in
their
brief
on
reargument
although
they
had
a
slight
modification
and
attempted
to
draw
some
support
from
what
i
might
call
the
spirit
of
shapiro
rather
than
shapiro
itself
as
to
justifying
this
courts
earlier
decision
in
kahriger
and
lewis.
on
the
second
point,
here
again
the
parties
are
in
complete
accord.
the
government
concedes
forthrightly
that
the
tax,
the
$50
stamp
cannot
be
purchased
without
registering,
without
giving
the
name
and
address
of
your
business,
without
giving
the
names
and
address
of
all
your
employees
or
your
principals,
and
without
an
effect
confessing
to
whether
or
you're
engaged
in
the
business
of
gambling,
either
for
yourself
or
in
behalf
of
someone
else.
i
think
this
point
was
clearly
called
for
by
the
decisions
of
the
lower
court
particularly
the
third
circuit
decision
where
a
taxpayer
had
attempted
to
pay
the
tax
and
not
register
and
that
was
held
in
his
case
not
to
be
a
defense.
moreover,
the
registration
provisions
specifically
provide
that
in
section
4412
that
the
registration
shall
be
made
and
there
are
correlative
regulations
issued
by
the
commissioner
of
the
treasury
department
which
this
court
--
support
that.
here
again,
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
we're
clearly
within
--
what
the
court
said
in
the
albertson
case,
there
is
nothing
here
which
permits
less
than
literal
and
full
compliance
with
the
registration
requirements
and
the
form
that
is
required
to
register.
the
government,
although
admitting
as
i
have
said
that
the
registration
must
be
completed
repeatedly
characterizes
this
information
which
i've
just
discussed
has
minimal,
i'm
not
so
particularly
with
the
label
minimal
or
maximal
but
i
think
that
as
a
label
in
this
context
considering
the
nature
of
the
underlying
activity
involved,
this
can
hardly
be
considered
minimal.
in
connecticut
for
example,
it
is
a
violation
of
our
law
to
frequent
a
place
which
has
the
reputation
for
being
a
gambling
hall.
there
are
many,
many
statutes
where
the
information
contained
in
this
registration
would
be
a
virtual
confession
to
violation
of
state
law
and
perhaps
it's
substantially
to
a
conviction
of
federal
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
don't
think
the
government
denies
it,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
government's
position
is
--
well,
we
have
to
have
some
information
to
collect
the
tax
and
it
has
to
bend.
we
have
to
have
this
information,
how
can
you
collect
the
tax,
how
can
you
collect
the
tax
if
you
don't
know
where
the
taxpayer
lives,
if
you
don't
what
this
business
is,
that
type
of
thing.
i
should
point
out,
if
your
honor
please,
the
government
argues
in
their
opening
brief
and
i
think
this
is
important
in
connection
with
their
repeated
assertions
if
they're
only
looking
for
minimal
information
in
this
case.
the
government
points
out
in
their
opening
brief
disclosures
often
highly
detailed
and
this
is
page
13
of
their
opening
brief,
are
required
under
federal
law
of
those
who
chose
--
choose
to
engage
in
many
occupations
and
then
they
list
15
u.s.c.
involving
disclosures
from
the
investment
bankers
and
then
they
list
disclosures
required
of
radio
stations
and
then
they
list
disclosures
from
air
carriers,
then
they
list
disclosures
from
motor
carriers,
then
they
list
disclosures
from
lobbyist
and
there
they
list
--
and
then
they
also
list
disclosures
from
stockyard
dealers,
market
agencies
and
officers
and
employees
of
labor
union.
but
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
think
this
is
where
albertson
play
such
a
big
role.
to
test
to
measure
those
disclosures,
not
give
the
label
minimal
or
maximal
against
the
underlying
activity
to
which
they
relay.
where
in
connecticut,
i'm
sorry,
where
in
this
country
is
it
to
be
an
illegal
to
be
an
investment
adviser?
where
is
it
a
crime
to
run
a
radio
station?
where
is
it
a
crime
to
run
an
airplane?
where
is
it
a
crime
to
run
a
labor
union?
where
is
it
a
crime
to
run
a
motor
truck?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
question
which
the
court
so
emphasized
in
albertson
dispels
the
notion
of
minimum
disclosure
that
the
government
urges
in
this
case.
in
fact,
in
the
examples
that
they've
cite
in
their
brief
that
i've
just
referred
to
there
is
no
suggestion
of
illegality.
but
in
our
case,
in
the
case
before
the
court
today
the
entire
area
is
permeated
in
the
criminal
activity
as
the
term
is
used
in
the
albertson
case.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor
and
although
narcotics
tax
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
as
--
you
know
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
basis
of
the
taxing
power
per
se
it
has
not
been
reviewed
against
fifth
amendment
problems
and
i
noticed
--
i
think
its
particularly
significant
that
the
government
didn't
cite
the
marijuana
tax
of
the
narcotics
tax
when
they
were
requiring
disclosures.
so
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
situation
requiring
narcotics
is
very
close
in
principle
to
the
gambling
situation
i
would
concede.
the
possession
of
narcotics
is
essentially
illegal
throughout
the
united
states.
and
it
would
depend
i
think
precisely
on
the
nature
of
the
disclosures
required
by
the
various
acts
to
what
extent
they
are.
they
very
well
may
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
constitutional
scrutiny
that
is
required
by
fifth
amendment
examination
that
we
urge
here
in
light
of
albertson.
that
question
has
never
been
answered
by
the
court
to
my
knowledge
although
as
i've
said
before
they
have
been
upheld
on
the
basis
in
the
taxing
power
but
they
were
definitely
upheld
in
the
area
of
the
tenth
amendment
whether
or
not
the
narcotics
and
marijuana
acts
infringe
on
the
powers
of
the
state.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
in
the
marijuana
situation?
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
we
say
this
if
your
honor
please,
we
take
two
positions
on
that.
we
say
that
that
at
first
and
the
government
concede
is
the
information
must
be
supplied
that
the
government
concedes.
now
if
you're
opposing
a
new
statute
which
could
be
affected
so
as
no
information
is
required
that
would
tend
to
incriminate
then
we
say
that
doesn't
run
or
follow
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
one
thing
that
might
be
worth
emphasizing
at
this
point
in
response
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
limited
scope
of
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
very
case.
i
presented
to
the
court
in
my
petition
for
certiorari
a
tenth
amendment
argument
and
i
think
that
you
can
argue
forcefully
as
some
of
the
dissenters
did
in
kahriger
that
the
congress
was
merely
attempting
to
regulate
state
activity
here.
but
i'm
setting
that
to
one
side,
i
don't
ask
this
court
to
rely
on
that
argument
at
all.
i
realized
that
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
there
can
be
compliance
with
this
tax
without
running
the
risk
of
violating
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
way
that
tax
is
now
framed,
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
clear
under
albertson
that
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
cannot
be
avoided.
now
if
we
say,
can
congress
in
any
way
tax
this
activity
so
it
doesn't
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
i
say
yes.
the
congress
hasn't
elected
to
do
that
at
this
stage,
if
they
very
well
might,
if
we
prevail
in
this
case.
that
congress
might
grant
immunity
as
they've
done
in
some
many,
many
instances
and
as
a
catalogue
in
some
of
the
briefs
in
the
companion
case.
or
if
there
could
conceivably
be
a
way
that
could
be
fashioned
for
the
anonymous
payment
of
this
tax
then
perhaps
it
could
be
paid
without
violating
the
fifth
amendment
but
i
think
under
the
present
structure,
by
the
mere
fact
for
example,
that
if
i
buy
a
stamp
i
must
display
it
publicly
on
my
premises
or
face
a
penalty
even
if
i
negligently
fail
to
do
it
and
non-willfully.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
there
can
be
no
compliance
with
the
statute
without
violating
the
fifth
amendment
and
that's
the
basis
of
our
claim
and
i
think
where
we
have
most
of
the
quarrel
with
the
government.
the
government
says
to
us
you
really
saying
you
can
tax
gambling.
and
our
response
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that's
not
our
position.
if
the
congress
wants
to
tax
gambling,
it
may
or
may
not
have
power,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
right
now.
i'm
sure
that
1951
when
this
was
passed,
congress
felt
it
didn't
have
the
power
to
reach
gambling
because
of
the
scope
of
interstate
commerce.
they
may
now
feel
that
they
can
directly
outlaw
gambling.
i
don't
know.
but
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is
we
are
not
maintaining
that
this
cannot
be
taxed
as
the
government
says.
we
would
concede
arguendo
for
the
purposes
of
this
scope
of
this
grant
of
certiorari
that
this
activity
can
be
taxed.
but
what
can't
happen
is
what
was
summarized
so
nicely
in
the
(inaudible)
journal
comment
that
came
out
after
this
case
was
argued
last
term.
what
can
happen
is
this
tax
cannot
be
administered
so
as
to
violate
petitioner's
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
elements
of
this
act,
they
are
bad,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
is
that
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
that
can
be
answered
most
clearly
by
referring
to
form
11-c.
i
think
every
single
question
on
this
form
which
the
government
now
admits
must
be
paid
is
bad.
they
want
the
name
and
address
of
the
business.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
they
want
the
name
and
address
of
your
principals,
who
you're
working
for.
they
want
the
name
and
address
of
all
your
employees
and
there's
a
supplemental
regulation
the
government
issued.
if
you
change
any
of
those
employees
you
must
run
to
the
internal
revenue
commission
within
ten
days
and
give
the
name
and
address
of
the
new
employees.
they
want
to
know
whether
or
not
you
are
engaged
in
a
business
of
accepting
wagers
for
yourself.
they
want
to
know
whether
or
not
you
are
accepting
it
for
somebody
else.
on
top
of
the
form
and
leaving
the
form
to
one
side
and
assuming
arguendo
that
it
could
be
--
the
tax
could
be
purchased
without
the
form
which
is
not
the
case
as
the
government
concede.
the
mere
purchase
and
mandatory
exhibiting
of
the
stamp
is
violative
of
the
privilege
we
maintain.
that's
the
second
bad
aspect
and
perhaps
the
third
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
the
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
the
key
basis
for
distinction
lies
again
in
the
albertson
case,
your
honor,
where
you
must
--
the
court
must
examine
whether
or
not
the
inquiry
is
directed
against
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
activity.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
your
honor.
it's
highly
regulated
but
it's
not
essentially
an
illegal
activity.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
not
too
sure
in
response
to
that
but
i
think
the
important
distinction,
your
honor
is
--
can
be
seen
more
readily
but
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
the
important
distinction
i
think
and
you've
seen
readily
by
comparing
albertson
to
sullivan.
sullivan
holds
that
even
though
you've
made
your
money
illegally,
you
have
to
pay
income
tax
and
maybe
you
can
take
the
fifth
amendment
to
an
individual
question
where
did
the
illegal
bookie
get
his
money
on
his
income
tax
form
and
perhaps
when
the
essential
activity
is
neutralized
in
sullivan
and
i
think
essentially
the
liquor
industry
is
a
legal
industry
or
neutral
within
the
meaning
of
sullivan-albertson
distinction.
then
i
think
the
claim
can
be
made
that
we
fall
within
the
albertson
rationale
that
when
it's
permeated
with
criminal
conduct,
there's
no
obligation
to
file
and
pay
the
tax
and
register
because
you
cannot
conceivably
can
--
no
one
can
comply
with
it
without
incriminating
himself.
now,
i
think
that
brings
up
a
point
i
think
that
is
important,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
there
would
be
stamp
under
the
law
has
to
be
publicly
displayed
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
that
would
be
--
if
i
had
a
stamp
in
my
place
of
business
in
the
city
of
bridgeport
hanging
in
my
window
or
hanging
where
it
can
be
readily
seen
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
it's
virtually
a
confession,
if
your
honor
please,
that
i'm
violating
the
gaming
laws
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
say,
if
your
honor
please,
if
we
get
to
the
point
where
the
government
concedes
the
income
tax
situation
is
where
this
tax
can
be
paid
anonymously.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
the
very
important
distinction
in
the
cases.
for
example,
the
governments
brief
at
page
22
in
their
opening
brief
in
the
costello
case.
we
recognized
that
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
the
matters
involved
here,
registration
and
filing
of
a
wagering
tax
return
and
the
filing
of
an
income
tax
return
at
issue
in
sullivan.
this
is
so
because
the
income
tax
return
permits
reporting
of
income
without
specific
identification
of
source.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
your
honor,
that
--
but
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
without
source
identification
the
anonymous
situation
comes
in
not
to
frequently
in
the
laws
but
not
that
i
think
is
an
analogous
situation
is
the
federal
governments
tax
on
real
estate
conveyances.
if
i
have
closing
of
property
in
bridgeport,
i
send
my
secretary
to
the
post
office.
she
buys
stamps
from
the
post
office
at
a
rate
of
a
dollar,
ten
a
thousand
for
the
value
of
the
property
closed.
no
one
asked
her
name.
no
one
asked
anything.
she
comes
back
and
the
stamps
are
signed
by
me
at
the
closing
and
put
on
the
deed
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
i
think
that
there
is
a
clash
here
that
the
government
must
realize
and
that
it
must
accommodate
the
payment
of
the
tax
so
as
not
to
infringe
the
privilege.
perhaps
the
easiest
way
would
be
to
grant
immunity
that
the
congress
has
elected
to
do
in
its
--
in
many
respects
decided
the
opposite.
it's
asked
that
they
be
publicly
displayed.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor,
if
understand
your
correct
--
question
correctly
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
whether
or
not
someone
like
petitioner
could
pay
his
income
tax
on
his
alleged
illegal
activity
without
disclosing
where
he
got
his
money.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
sir.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
insofar
as
it
requires
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
a
disclosure,
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that's
--
that
specific
provision
which
you're
referring
to
is
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
600
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
shapiro
is
distinguished
by
all
the
parties,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no
and
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
summarize
the
issues.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
did
have
one
other
point
to
make
there.
i
think
that
that
issue
that
required
records
provision
of
the
income
tax
law
which
this
court
is
not
giving
definitive
attention
to
yet
and
which
has
drawn
a
mixed
response
from
the
lower
courts
in
which
the
government
has
not
pressed
review
here
is
somewhat
different
because
as
i
read
that
provision,
it
says
you
must
keep
those
records.
now,
the
next
step
may
be
and
would
obviously
be
from
a
point
of
law
--
point
of
view
of
tax
enforcement
that
you
must
keep
them
because
someday
we're
going
to
want
to
look
at
it.
when
that
someday
comes,
we
may
have
a
condition
that's
akin
to
shapiro
but
right
now
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
you
have
to
be
compelled
under
section
6001
to
keep
those
records.
i
think
that
if
the
time
comes
when
the
government
says
you
must
produce
those
record
that
you
can
claim
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
is
correct.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
is
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
that
is
the
income
tax
situation
posed
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
that
the
situation
why
shapiro
doesn't
apply
here
can
--
shapiro
can
be
distinguished
within
the
limits
set
up
in
shapiro
itself.
shapiro
holds
as
--
you
suggested
mr.
justice
white
that
in
the
context
of
the
opa
regulations,
certain
records
which
would
ordinarily
be
kept
anyway
which
is
not
the
situation
of
the
course
in
the
gambling
tax
situation.
certain
records
which
can
ordinarily
be
kept
anyway
can
be
subpoenaed
and
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
think,
if
you
please
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
they
are
not
--
the
records
that
are
ordinarily
kept
in
the
regular
course
of
business.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas
and
my
response
is
as
follows:
i
do
not
believe
that
acceptance
of
our
position
here
requires
the
invalidation
of
the
hypothetical
situation
which
you
posed
in
connection
with
the
maintaining
of
records
in
connection
with
the
income
tax.
and
i
think
and
i
go
back
again,
i
think
that
it
relates
to
the
total
context.
income,
the
constant
generation
of
income
in
this
country
is
essentially
a
neutral
non-criminal
activity.
one
person,
perhaps
the
petitioner
in
this
case
may
participate
in
certain
illegal
activity
and
he
may
have
a
right
to
claim
his
individual
privilege
against
self
adminis
--
self-incrimination
at
the
appropriate
time.
but
it
does
not
require
the
invalidation
of
the
record
keeping
provision
directed
to
the
country
at
large.
but
in
our
particular
case,
that
congress
has
singled
out
almost
exclusively
not
even
all
kinds
of
gambling
because
they
have
let
out
the
church
gambling.
they've
let
out
the
las
vegas
gambling,
almost
exclusively,
illegal
gambling.
and
i
say
almost
exclusively
because
the
tax
does
apply
to
the
las
vegas
bookie
and
it
does
apply
to
the
las
vegas
policy
operator.
but
because
of
the
peculiar
regulations,
some
of
which
i
referred
to
in
my
brief,
they're
pretty
much
an
insignificant
aspect
to
the
matter.
in
las
vegas
for
example,
a
bookmaker
can't
be
in
a
casino.
bookmaking
must
be
isolated
from
the
general
gambling
activity
under
the
nevada
regulations.a
bookmaker
in
nevada
must
pass
the
federal
tax
to
the
customer
and
that's
permissible
with
the
federal
regulation.
but
if
a
non-nevada
bookmaker
passes
the
tax
along,
he
must
give
the
name
and
address
of
his
customer
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
well,
when
that
occurs
in
any
one
of
the
other
fifty
states
besides
nevada
that
immediately
places
the
customer
in
jeopardy
of
violating
the
law.
such
is
not
the
case
in
nevada
because
it's
legal
to
bet
with
nevada
bookmakers.
so
i
think
the
central
core
of
the
case
rest
pretty
much
with
that
distinction,
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
think
the
peculiar
wording
in
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
indicates
that
distinction
because
the
question
is
not
just,
should
kahriger
and
lewis
be
overturned
but
should
kahriger
and
lewis
be
overturned
in
the
light
of
albertson.
and
albertson
with
its
continuing
comments
on
the
sullivan
case,
the
income
tax
situation
that
mr.
justice
holmes
points
out
that
distinction.
now
i
think
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
many
refinements
in
the
firearms
registration
act
which
will
be
argued
immediately
following
these
two
cases.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
would
agree
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
here
again
i
think
it
depends
on
the
underlying
activity
in
the
regulations
requiring
the
keeping
of
guns
in
the
various
states.
i
think
that
our
position
is
very
similar
to
the
circuit
court
opinion
in
the
russell
case
where
the
circuit
court
struck
down
one
provision
of
the
firearm
registration
act
and
which
the
government
has
not
--
apparently
the
government
has
acquiesced
in
and
i
think
therefore
that
that
is
the
aspect
that
is
closely
akin
to
the
wagering
tax
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
during
the
luncheon
recess,
one
of
the
persons
in
the
spectator's
session
of
the
court
inquired
of
me
and
perhaps
this
is
an
emotional
approach
to
this
case
that
bears
a
moments
comment,
i
pay
my
taxes
why
shouldn't
your
petitioner
pay
his
taxes.
and
i
think
i
should
just
take
one
moment
to
emphasize
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
it
does
not
involve
the
income
tax.
it
does
not
involve
a
gamblers
duty
to
pay
tax
on
income
he
makes
in
wagering
or
in
conducting
wagering
activities.
the
government
concedes
this
in
its
brief
in
the
session
that
i've
pointed
out
to
before.
i
think
and
i
believe
i
have
responded
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
inquiry
just
before
the
recess
and
i
think
there
is
one
statement
in
the
government's
brief
that
perhaps
summarize
this,
it's
an
example,
summarizes
where
we
feel
they're
taking
us
to
somewhat
faulty
approach
to
this
case.
it's
actually
filed
in
the
government's
grosso
brief
at
page
fifteen,
these
are
companion
cases
and
the
government
asked
this
court,
is
a
person
free
to
assert
the
privilege
to
justify
a
failure
to
pay
a
tax
on
his
residential
property
or
to
file
a
property
tax
return
calling
for
his
address?
suppose
that
a
local
grand
jury
is
investigating
prostitution.
a
person
believed
to
own
and
reside
in
a
house
suspected
of
being
(inaudible)
is
summoned
and
asked
to
give
his
address.
in
that
setting
he
may
be
privileged
not
to
answer.
we
assume
he
would
not
however
be
privileged
to
refuse
to
pay
property
taxes
on
the
house
if
he
were
the
owner
even
though
such
payment
might
identify
him
with
the
suspected
activities
at
the
house
as
surely
as
what
his
admission
of
ownership
to
the
grand
jury.
and
with
that
question
i
think
we
can
agree.
but
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is,
is
that
hypothetical
that
the
government
poses
is
not
this
case.
to
make
the
government's
hypothetical
our
case,
substitute
the
general
property
tax
in
their
example
and
say
that
the
state
of
connecticut
or
any
other
state
or
all
of
the
states
for
that
matter
imposeda
specific
property
tax
on
houses
used
for
prostitution.
then
i
think
you
have
the
situation
that
we're
faced
with
today.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
there
would
either
be
a
claim
of
the
privilege,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white,
or
just
a
plain
non-completion
of
it,
as
i
point
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes
your
honor.
you're
changing
the
actual
situation
we'd
be
in.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
would
not
say
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
in
the
same
manner
as
it
is
here.
i
would
say
it
violated
the
sullivan
doctrine.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
if
they
would
not
honor
the
privilege
of
the
self-incrimination
that
was
advanced.but
perhaps
i
should
point
what
the
government
admits
in
their
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that's
what
they
say
about
the
wagering
tax
your
honor.
but
they
admit
in
the
income
tax
situation
at
page
22
of
their
brief
that
no
source
must
be
given.
a
gambler,
my
client
if
he
wanted
to,
assuming
arguendo,
he
made
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
illegal
activity.
he
goes
to
internal
revenue
and
says
i
made
a
hundred
thousand
dollars,
here
is
your
tax.i
don't
claim
any
deductions.
i
don't
claim
any
special
exemptions.
i
don't
want
to
disclose
anything
to
you.
the
government
concedes
that's
proper.
that's
the
big
distinction.
this
is
so
because
the
income
tax
return
permits
reporting
of
income
without
specific
identification
of
source.
that's
the
brief
of
the
united
states,
not
my
brief,
so
that's
a
very
important
distinction
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
mr.--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
question's
semantics
but
what
i
feel
in
that
context
is
as
if
it's
a
tax
law
that
applies
across
the
board
reaching
neutral
activity
within
the
meaning
of
albertson
then
the
privilege
may
be
claimed
in
that
specific
question.
but
it
doesn't
invalidate
the
whole
structure
as
we
claim
the
situation
arises
here
because
of
the
fact
that
nobody
can
comply
with
this
tax
without
incriminating
himself.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
think,
your
honor
please,
and
i'm
glad
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
came
up
because
i
remember
last
term
you
referred
to
a
bucket
shop
and
i
think
my
response
wasn't
very
precise.
i
think
this,
the
situation
that
you
hypothecate
where
you
have
a
law
making
--
relating
to
all
securities
dealers
is
one
thing.
but
if
you
have
a
statute
that
says
all
bucket
shop
operators
must
pay
a
special
tax
then
you're
very
close
to
the
wagering
tax
scheme.
under
my
brief
research
on
the
subject,
i
think
every
state
outlaws
bucket
shops.
i
know
in
mr.
justice
holmes'
famous
case,
ballman
versus
fagan,
which
i
perhaps
should
have
put
in
my
brief
and
didn't.
the
question
involved
a
--
the
use
of
the
privilege
via
bucket
shop
operator
and
mr.
justice
holmes
upheld
the
privilege.
they
said
someone
who
is
a
bucket
shop
operator
could
reasonably
fear
incrimination.
this
was
an
oral
question
before
a
grand
jury
i
believe.
and
he
upheld
the
privilege
in
that
bucket
shop
context.
if
the
two
that
--
actually
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
pardon?
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
it
is
an
accepted
thing
but
we
maintained,
if
your
honor
please,
that
since
albertson
that
distinction
has
been
displaced.
albertson
said
point
blank
that
we
draw
no
constitutional
significance
to
an
oral
claim
of
it
in
the
witness
stand
or
a
documentary
registration
requirement
such
as
an
issue
in
albertson.
so
i
think
that
although
there
was
an
earlier
discussion
in
some
of
the
courts'
earlier
cases
that
now
has
gone
by
the
board.
but
i
think
that
the
example
that
you
mentioned
if
we
can
just
take
a
moment
to
give
two
faces
of
that
example,
underlines
the
importance
of
our
position
and
what
we
think
is
the
governments'
faulty
position.
of
course
the
united
states
can
tax
security
dealers
across
the
board
and
it
doesn't
invalidate
the
requirement
for
bucket
shop
operator
to
pay.
of
course
they
can
tax
income
and
a
gambler
must
pay
his
income
tax.
but
when
they
zero
in
and
say
all
bucket
shop
operators
must
pay
a
tax,
all
bookies
must
pay
a
tax.
they
have
so
geared
the
tax
structure
under
their
purported
power
to
tax
so
as
to
compel
a
confession
to
crime.
we
do
not
challenge
the
governments'
right
to
tax.
we
do
challenge
their
right
to
effectuate
the
tax
so
as
to
compel
a
confession
to
criminal
activity
almost
universally
recognized
this
criminal
activity.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
no
your
honor,
not
exactly
correct.
my
position
on
that
precise
point
is
that
the
government
concedes
and
i
was
quoting
before
from
their
brief
at
page
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
our
theory
is
this,
the
income
tax
structure
is
so
set
up
that
they
don't
--
that
the
taxpayer
can
avoid
disclosing
source.
he
doesn't
have
to
specifically
claim
that
privilege.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
he
wants
to
rely
on
the
exemption,
if
he
wants
to
say
that
i
paid
employee
a
to
be
my
runner
in
a
bookie
operation,
he
wants
to
take
that
as
an
exemption.
he
may
have
to
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
we
would
claim,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
situation
is
controlled
by
sullivan
and
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
on
the
form
they
refused
--
could
--
or
the
taxpayer
could
--
say
put
them
in
their
privilege.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
it's
our
position
that
this
--
our
position
in
this
case
does
not
take
us
to
that
issue.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
because
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
i
feel
that
it
doesn't
because
in
that
particular
case
the
requirement
at
that
stage
doesn't
incriminate
remotely
because
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
they're
saying
keep
your
records
in
the
drawer.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
believe
he
does,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
believe
that
is
our
position.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
shapiro
was
read
that
broadly
which
the
government
does
not
asked
the
court
to
do.
if
shapiro
means
that
if
congress
says
any
record
that
we
say
you
must
keep
is
non-privileged,
then
we
get
a
shapiro
issue
and
i
would
respectfully
request
that
the
court
overturn
shapiro.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
read
shapiro
that
broadly.
i
don't
think
the
government
wants
the
court
to
read
shapiro
that
broadly.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
we
read
shapiro
as
not
elevating
to
the
issue
of
this
case
for
the
following
reasons.
in
shapiro,
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
one
in
view
of
the
limited
scope
of
certiorari
in
connection
with
albertson.
in
shapiro,
the
regulations
involved
were
directed
i
believe
to
prove
in
the
wholesale
producers.
there
was
not
a
zeroing
in
on
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
activity,
as
mr.
justice
brennan's
word
in
albertson
and
his
decent
to
the
communist
party
case.
and
i
think
that
--
your
honor's
situation
that
you
posed
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
when
they
make
my
client
bring
the
records
in
if
he
kept
them
and
they
order
him
to
produce
them,
we're
back
to
the
sullivan
situation
where
the
taxpayer
may
have
an
individual
claim.
but
that
as
i
think
is
important
to
emphasize
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't
speak
that.
but
i
was
directing
not
to
this
case
but
to
your
hypothetical.
you're
hypothetical
is
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
that
because
we
have
the
other
very
important
distinction
that
the
government
relies
upon.
it's
set
out
in
our
brief
and
professor
wrights'
brief
in
the
next
case
and
that
distinction
is
this,
that
here
we're
dealing
with
registering
and
openly
confessing.
we're
not
dealing
with
records
kept
and
later
produced
--
i
thought
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
you're
hypothetical
was
the
other
situation.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
say
in
the
context
of
your
hypothetical,
if
this
court
should
determine
that
shapiro
means
that
any
record
required
by
the
congress
to
be
kept
is
non-privileged
then
i
would
respectfully
request
that
shapiro
cannot
withstand
the
later
theory
of
the
fifth
amendment
case.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
i
don't
have
to
get
to
that
point
in
this
case.
only
in
your
hypothetical
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
do
i
have
to
get
to
that.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
i
make
myself
clear
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
is
to
a
large
measure
the
governments'
position.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
they've
argued
it
under
a
slogan
called
their
accommodation
theory.
in
other
words,
the
minimal
encroachment
on
the
privilege
must
accommodate
the
need
for
information
in
order
to
enforce
the
tax
laws.
we
think
that's
--
theory
is
not
sound
for
reasons
(inaudible).
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
--
i
believe
that's
our
position.
they
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
to
give
way
when
we
need
the
data
to
collect
the
tax.
i'd
like
if
i
may
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
alright.
i
would
like
to
say
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
comment
very
briefly
on
the
government's
position.
i
didn't
comment
in
my
opening
remarks
on
the
use
restriction
alternative
suggestion
that
the
government
makes
and
i
won't
dwell
on
it
in
depth
now.
i
had
set
out
fairly
and
comprehensively
in
all
of
our
briefs.
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
mention
of
the
comment
of
mr.
justice
harlan
regarding
section
6107.
i
think
that's
very
informative
on
the
government's
alternative
argument
because
the
government
admits
in
effect
that
that
section
stands
in
the
way
of
their
alternative
argument
that
they
argued
to
the
court,
well,
until
we
can
get
the
internal
revenue
service
to
get
congress
to
amend
that
we'll
sort
of
ignore
it.
they
can
of
course
represent
that
they'll
ignore
a
law
of
congress
but
they'll
--
it's
very
malleable
on
the
government's
position
and
i
think
that
the
point
that
was
raised
in
regard
to
section
6107
demonstrate
to
some
extent
the
inability
of
the
use
of
the
use
restriction
alternative
argument
that
the
government
advanced.
the
government
also
made
reference
to
fear
of
conjure
circle
which
is
the
word
used
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
sullivan
case.
and
i
think
as
its
reliance
on
that
is
based
primarily
on
the
statement
mr.
beytagh
made
immediately
before
that
if
i've
heard
him
correctly.
he
said,
“no
one
will
really
know
if
you
had
a
proper
privilege
or
not.”
but
that
certainly
is
no
problem
in
this
area
like
in
albertson
where
the
area
is
so
saturated
with
criminal
conduct.
my
only
other
remark
before
closing
cause
perhaps
i
thought
i
might
shed
a
little
bit
of
light
on
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
white
was
talking
about.
as
i
understand
the
situation
i
think
there's
no
question
if
the
income
tax
can
be
paid
so
as
not
to
identify
its
source
but
and
this
very
important
for
the
large
volume
of
voluntary
compliance
and
the
large
amount
of
legal
activity
in
this
country
in
the
income
tax
context.
if
taxpayer
wants
any
deductions
or
if
the
taxpayer
wants
any
exemptions,
if
he
has
eployees
there
must
be
disclosures
regarding
that.
but
if
an
illegal
--
if
a
person
involved
in
illegal
activity
pays
the
tax
on
his
gross
income
and
claims
nothing,
as
i
understand
the
procedure
and
as
the
government
concedes
this
can
be
done
anonymously.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
(inaudible)versus
california?
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
might
your
honor.
it's
on
the
periphery
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
--
of
this
area.
but
the
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
it's
not
this
case
and
i
mentioned
this
to
show
that
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
as
the
latter
and
perhaps
too
strongly
that
because
it's
conceded
by
united
states
in
this
particular
case.
but
i
think
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
think
that's
the
way
it
will
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
but
i
think
the
important
point
that
this
all
--
guy's
home
is
that
when
united
states
wants
money
and
that's
what
they
really
want,
there
are
ways
that
which
they
can
collect
their
money
without
making
the
privilege
vendor
accommodate.
and
for
all
these
reasons
and
for
the
reasons
i
advanced
in
the
briefs,
i
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
court
below.
