mr.

chief

earl
warren
motion
is
granted.
mr.
zeldes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
there
be
anything
wrong
about
that
so
far
as
arrest
them
to
--
and
a
gambler
of
nevada
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
even
if
a
state
made
gambling
entirely
legal,
you
think
this
would
be
constitutionally
invalid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
little
different
though,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
we
have
that
in
the
income
tax,
don't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
saying
if
a
man
wanted
to
run
a
bucket
shop
for
instance
and
not
conduct
its
--
his
business
illegally
but
give
the
appearance
of
it
being
a
legal
business.
and
the
government
required
him
to
register
and
pay
a
tax
on
his
transactions,
would
that
be
subject
to
the
same
infirmity
as
this
because
the
fellow
didn't
intend
to
do
any
honest
business,
he
intended
--
do
all
of
it
illegally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
that
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
think
a
man
could
setup
a
bucket
shop
and
--
in
violation
of
federal
law
which
is
to
get
license
or
refuse
to
make
a
tax
return?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
maybe
the
--
at
a
particular
kind
of
tax
for
that
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
gambling
is
legal
or
illegal
according
to
state
law
in
most
instances
and
--
which
isn't
up
to
the
government
necessarily
is
it
to
determine
whether
man
is
going
to
gamble
legally
or
illegally,
if
it
wants
to
require
a
certificate
licensing
of
it
--
from
the
taxing
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
suppose
the
--
you
protect
the
other
form
of
the
dilemma
and
say
that
if
every
state
in
the
union
decided
to
have
permit
rules
on
racing
and
football
games
and
so
forth,
made
them
legal.
i
suppose
that
the
government
would
require
them
to
anyone
who
bets
on
those
things
to
register
as
these
people
required
to
register
even
though
they
might
be
engaging
in
other
kinds
of
illegal
gambling,
wouldn't
you
think
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
what
was
the
change
in
the
second
form
mr.
--
briefly
i
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
james
marchetti,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
zeldes,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
zeldes,
i
noticed
the
briefs
that
there
were
7200
and
some
persons
who
had
registered
under
this
act.
i
wondered
if
there
any
records
to
show
how
many
of
these
people
were
tried
and
convicted
in
state
courts
as
a
result
of
having
registered.
is
there
any
basis
--
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
beytagh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
mr.
beytagh
to
say
that
it
would
be
questionable
whether
the
government
could
require
registration
and
what
they
require
in
this
situation
in
the
case
of
narcotics.
in
your
account,
we
would
--
mr.
justice
fortas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
a
hundred
men
in
dollars
in
pay,
and
if
they
got
that
in
15
years,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
size
will
amount
of
money,
i
wonder
is
this
tax
cost
a
hundred
million
dollars
in
the
last
15
years
to
collect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
a
hundred
million
dollars
is
a
lot
of
money
even
in
these
days.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
would
understand
--
i
understand
that
their
present
time,
there're
7200
and
some
people
who
were
registered
under
this
act.
do
you
have
any
figures
mr.
beytagh
which
would
indicate
whether
all
or
many
or
few
of
these
people
who
have
registered
have
actually
been
prosecuted
and
convicted
as
the
result
of
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
it
generally
recognized
in
the
literature
on
the
subject
that
even
though
there
are
7200
to
those
people
who've
registered
in
this
country
that
very
few
of
them
compared
to
what
you're
speaking
have
been
prosecuted
for
running
illegal
gambling
games
and
that
the
public
is
wondering
why
if
it's
so
easy
for
the
state
to
get
that
information
if
they
don't
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
suggestion
is
that
it
will
be
done
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
income
tax
is
kept
confidential,
income
tax
return?

mr.

chief

earl
warren
very
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
let
the
motion
be
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
speak
a
little
louder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
motion
is
granted.
mr.
zeldes
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
people
doing
in
a
--
in
narcotics,
they're
required
to
register?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
real
distinction
between
the
two,
between
the
non
--
the
requirement
for
registration
in
selling
narcotics,
dealing
in
narcotics
and
the
gambling?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
your
position
then
that
if
the
information
required
was
more
limited
here
than
it
is
that
the
registration
would
be
illegal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.no,
i
mean
in
the
gambling.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
but
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
if
conceivably
the
congress
can
pass
some
kind
of
a
taxing
act
of
this
kind,
what
elements
that
it
cannot
put
into
the
act
are
in
this
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
fine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
that
different
from
the
liquor
statutes
which
require
--
and
they
keep
a
certificate
in
their
place
of
business,
stating
who
the
owner
is
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
they
pay
the
tax.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
in
liquor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
the
only
people
if
that
would
--
that
registration
act
on
liquor
would
injure
would
be
those
who
were
engaged
illegally.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
we
get
plenty
of
cases
here
of
illegal
sale
of
liquor
and
manufacture
of
liquor
and
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
is
more
prevalent,
i
suppose
that's
the
--
that
moonshining
is
more
prevalent
than
gambling
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
if
this
only
require
that
they
register
and
pay
the
tax
and
keep
a
--
keep
the
stamp
tax
into
the
--
to
the
--
the
stamp
in
evidence
in
their
place
of
business
with
no
other
information,
would
that
be
bad
in
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
would
the
bad
parts
--
it
would
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
take
that
element
down
and
how
about
the
rest
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
anonymously?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that
isn't
--
that
is
the
same,
to
tax
anonymously.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
your
opinion,
is
there
any
constitutional
difference
between
this
kind
of
registration
and
tax
and
that
of
the
machine
gun
registration
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know
that
but
i
just
wondered
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we
would
have
to
go
as
far
in
the
case
like
that
as
you
want
us
to
go
here?
is
there
any
constitutional
difference
between
requiring
those
who
sell
machine
guns
to
register
their
tax
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
stockbrokers
licensing
acts
if
there
we
have
in
the
federal
government
and
all
over
the
country
to
as
applied
to
a
bucket
shop
that
is
not
registered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
real
question
--
different
thing,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
claiming
that
privilege
on
the
witness
stand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
five
minutes
extra
to
rebut
because
your
time
is
practically
up
now
mr.--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
beytagh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
if
you
--
to
give
a
wrong
name
on
your
return,
isn't
it,
isn't
that
a
false
statement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
close
your
argument

tax
into
the
--
to
the
--
the
stamp

evidence
in
their
place
of
business
with
no
other
information,
would
that
be
bad
in
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
would
the
bad
parts
--
it
would
be?
chief
justice
earl

chief
justice
earl
warren

that

rest
of
it?

earl

is
the

chief
justice
earl
warren
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
your
opinion,
is
there
any
constitutional
difference
between
this
kind
of
registration
and
tax
and
that
of
the
machine
gun
registration
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know
that
but
i
just
wondered
if

chief

earl
warren
--
we
would
have
to
go
as
far
in
the
case
like
that
as
you
want
us
to
go
here?
is
there
any
constitutional
difference
between
requiring
those
who
sell
machine
guns
to
register
their
tax
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
we'll
recess

and
all
over
the
country
to
as
applied
to
a
bucket
shop
that
is
not
registered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
real
question
--
different
thing,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
claiming
that
privilege
on
the
witness
stand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
five
minutes
extra
to
rebut
because
your
time
is
practically
up
now

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
beytagh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
if
you
--
to
give
a
wrong
name
on
your
return,
isn't
it,
isn't
that
a
false
statement?
chief
justice
earl
warren

may
close
your
argument
mr.
