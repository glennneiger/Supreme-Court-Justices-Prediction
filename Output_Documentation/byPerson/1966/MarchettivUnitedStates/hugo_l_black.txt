kahriger
or
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
see
any
distinction
between
the
questions
in
the
two
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
government
could
impo
--
both
impose
and
collect
tax
on
gambling
without
requiring
registration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
see
a
real
difference
seeing
how
the
government
to
do
those
two
things,
to
collect
the
tax
on
gambling
and
to
require
the
person
who's
engaged
in
gambling
to
(inaudible)
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
causes
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
it
--
was
that
one
of
the
--
it
seem
to
be
what
mr.
justice
holmes
was
holding
in
his
original
case
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
in
this
question
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
see
anything
in
it
that
indicates
the
difference
in
what
a
man
has
to
admit
and
what
he
doesn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
drew
it,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
he
drew
it
pretty
clearly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
pay
the
law
--
the
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
pay
the
tax
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
require
--
does
it
say
anything
--
hold
anything
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
file
a
return
but
it
say,
he's
got
to
say
he
got
it
from
gambling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
rather
careful
if
you
refer
it
from
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
involved,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
return
--
they
required
them
to
confess
to
something,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
illegal
sale
of
whisky?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
is
of
course
a
very
decisive
distinction
between
a
law
which
requires
you
to
confess,
you
may
have
committed
a
crime.
a
law
which
could
--
requires
you
to
report
to
the
government
that
you
owe
it
so
much
taxes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
it's
a
part
of
it
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
of
it
might
not
be
valid
and
some
of
it
might.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
stand
on
that
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
would
admit
that
the
taxation
of
a
business
which
is
generally
known
to
be
criminal,
rather
a
large
part
of
the
united
states
is
rather
far
stretched
from
the
general
governmental
idea
that
you're
attacking.
business
for
the
purpose
of
giving
money
and
will
not
in
anyway
encourage
the
commission
of
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
there
been
any
study
made
of
any
kind
on
the
amount
of
money
that
united
states
government
gets
out
of
taxing
crimes,
in
connection
with
what
it
calls
to
collecting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
state
that
legalizes
that
business
of
narcotics?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
difference,
doesn't
it?
quite
a
difference
in
the
government
going
out
to
help
the
states
enforce
their
policy
which
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
guarantees
them
to
carry
on
and
taking
the
absence
of
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
authorizing
something
to
be
done,
the
great
power
of
the
federal
government,
which
under
the
provision
and
the
powers
between
the
states
and
the
nation
belongs
to
the
state
to
control,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course
it
interfered
with
the
prohibition
laws
when
the
federal
government
licensed
every
bootleg
in
the
united
states
and
let
them
put
it
up
in
flaming
colors
in
the
place
of
the
business,
that
they
were
licensed
to
sell
it
in
(inaudible)
when
the
state
law
forbad
it.
what
harm
would
it
do
the
government
to
keep
its
hands
on
taxing
things
that
it
does
not
permit
to
be
made
illegal
by
the
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
you're
too
done
but
you
--
you
come
down,
now
you're
saying
that
the
federal
government
shouldn't
be
running
in
opposition
to
the
state
in
connection
with
the
enforcement
of
governmental
policies
that
the
state
rightfully
think
it
has
the
power
to
regulate
in
those
regulations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
its
--
there's
a
difference
in
enforcing
this
federal
law
in
the
state
that
legalizes
gambling
and
one
which
does
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
difference
of
the
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
possible
that
the
law
not
be
valid
in
those
states
that
permit
gambling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
should
the
man
there
be
allowed
to
claim
any
privilege,
in
nevada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
couldn't
claim
could
he
that
he
was
going
to
be
prosecuted
in
nevada.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
for
gambling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
that
instance
if
the
state,
the
federal
government
would
be
aiding
nevada
to
carry
out
its
state
recognize
local
state
powers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
may
not
be
that
it
has
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
state
but
there
are
some
--
something
to
--
a
concept
i
should
think
that
in
a
union
of
states,
the
form
of
national
federal
government,
there's
something
to
them,
the
idea
that
the
federal
government
ought
to
be
barred
in
trying
to
frustrate
the
policies
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
how
it
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
gives
them
a
license
to
engage
in
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ever
hear
anybody
suggest
that
there's
any
possibility
that
they
get
any
net
tax
gain
out
of
that
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
means
if
--
does
that
not
mean
that
the
purpose
was
to
bar
gambling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
they
call
it
as
a
tax,
that
what
in
the
attitude
it
is
there's
a
method
of
helping
to
regulate
gambling,
isn't
it?
it
can't
be
a
tax
if
you
don't
collect
it
as
i
gather
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
men
there
are
in
the
revenue
department,
devote
that
services
trying
to
enforce
this
particular
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
suggesting
that
the
court
provides
the
right
of
some
kind
of
immunization
scheming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
be
a
kind
of
immunization,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
that
the
power
of
congress
if
there
is
such
a
power
to
grant
immunity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
grace
was
referred
--
decided
question,
the
government's
policy.
they
have
not
yet
decided
to
grant
any
governmental
immunity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
amount
to
that,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
were
to
do
that
and
congress
to
come
along
and
pass
the
law
and
say
we
do
not
want
any
such
relief
given
and
if
it's
immunity
which
was
in
my
judgment
be
immunity
from
prosecutions,
which
one
would
prevail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
law
or
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
agree
to
that.
i
agree
to
the
kind
of
immunity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
there
be
a
constitutional
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
subtitle?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
special
law
with
reference
to
that,
they're
making
it
sub
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
only.
justice
hugo
l.
black
becoming
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
deny
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
the
government
anywhere
forthrightly
argues
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
construed
for
the
reason,
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
except
in
crimes
that
involves
the
payment
of
taxes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
argue
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
a
--
in
other
words,
if
a
need
to
collect
taxes
means
that
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
mean
what
it
says
when
it
says
that
no
person
should
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
little
strange
to
worry
about
miranda
(inaudible)
if
that's
cleared.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
says
that
congress
shall
not
be
(inaudible)?
fifth
amendment,
doesn't
say
that?
doesn't
it
say
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
how
can
you
accommodate
that,
a
way
--
in
the
way
you
do
that
--
the
feeling,
the
amendment
to
that
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
make
it
unenforceable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
used
of
the
statement
when
a
man
is
compelled
by
the
government
to
make
the
conviction
of
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
accommodate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
can
the
court
repeal
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
just
makes
it
unenforceable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
designed
to
protect
him
from
being
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that'd
be,
if
you
grant
immunity,
you
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
no
immunity
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
be
a
thing
for
congress
to
do,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
do
i
understand
then
that
what
all
the
government
is
asking
is
that
we
provide
that
a
man
should
be
granted
immunity
from
any
prosecution
before
he
is
compelled
to
answer
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
thrust
of
the
question
is,
i'm
asking,
do
you
--
if
you
want
to
do
it
in
that
way,
you
provide
--
are
you
asking
us
to
provide
the
rules
which
--
to
the
effect
any
man
who
makes
one
of
this
tax
returns,
they'll
be
exempt
from
prosecution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
immunity
from
prosecution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
about
the
length
of
the
lead,
does
it?
that
passes
out
the
window
under
the
present
argument
because
here
the
man
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself,
that
he
has
committed
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it's
not
a
question
of
a
lien?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
would
you
say
on
your
return?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
make
false
statements?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
have
you
been
compelled
there
to
commit
a
crime?
how
do
say
that,
i
mean
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
light
of
(inaudible)
that's
right
but
is
that
the
standard
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
you
are
saying
that
if
you
have
got
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
conclude
that
in
order
to
implement
this
rule
and
accommodate
the
interest
of
the
state
and
federal
governments,
the
federal
government
must
be
prohibited
to
make
any
such
use
of
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
referred
to
the
restriction
on
use,
in
the
blue
case
the
court
said
even
if
we
assume
the
government
did
in
--
did
acquire
incriminating
evidence
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
blue
would
at
most
be
entitled
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
its
fruits
if
they
were
sought
to
be
used
against
him
at
trial.
there's
a
similar
statement
in
adams
versus
maryland.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
they
sought
a
rule
if
the
court
feels
that
kahriger
and
lewis
are
not
consistent.
fifth
amendment
as
presently
understood
would
provide
a
sensible
accommodation
not
only
in
these
cases
but
in
the
other
cases
in
which
albertson
may
have
some
difficulty
in
the
future
implications.
your
alternative
is
if
this
(inaudible)
congress
can't
put
an
excise
tax
on
gambling
unless
it
immunizes
these
gamblers
from
any
possible
incrimination.
and
i
don't
know
why
in
the
face
of
murphy
it's
not
appropriate
for
the
court
to
adopt
or
use
the
restriction
rule.
we
developed
at
length
that
seems
to
us
that
that
--
that
is
a
sound
and
a
sensible
position.
i
would
like
for
a
few
moments,
since
this
is
on
reargument
to
discuss
the
questions
that
the
court
posed
and
asked
to
have
dscussed
in
our
briefs
and
oral
argument.
we
take
the
position
as
mr.
zeldes
has
pointed
out
that
in
our
view
the
shapiro
case
is
not
of
direct
relevance
here.
as
we
read
and
understand
shapiro
it
relates
to
the
so-called
required
records
doctrine.
a
requirement
that
certain
records
be
maintained
and
kept
and
be
available
for
inspection
by
the
government.
and
we
think
that's
a
different
situation
from
one
in
which
the
government
requires
and
individual
to
affirmatively
come
forth
and
make
reports
or
returns
to
the
government.
it
seems
to
us
that
shapiro
has
it
is
evolved
over
the
years
as
understood
and
to
mean
in
the
context
in
which
it
arose.
the
court
pointed
out
in
shapiro
that
the
regulation
there
involved
records
that
were
customarily
and
regularly
kept.
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
an
appropriate
improper
view
of
shapiro.
the
alternative
of
saying
that
shapiro
is
applicable
any
time
the
government
requires
anything
to
be
filed
with
the
--
it
seems
to
us,
the
lack
of
any
sensible
limitations.
we
therefore
don't
argue
that,
is
that
reliable?
now
there
is
a
potential
shapiro
problem
with
respect
to
the
wagering
tax
as
we
point
out,
there's
a
section
of
the
wagering
tax
statute,
section
4403
that
provides
for
the
keeping
of
daily
records
of
the
wagering
activity.
that
statute
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
now
the
courts
below
in
this
or
in
the
grosso
case
considered
4403
and
petitioners
were
not
charged
with
failing
to
keep
such
records
nor
were
any
records
of
either
of
the
petitioners
along
those
lines
and
produced
against
them.
there
may
be
an
appropriate
case
in
which
this
question
comes
out
in
which
the
application
of
shapiro
is
involved.
it's
not
this
case
and
it
seems
to
us
that
there's
no
need
presently
to
get
to
that.
the
other
question
involves
the
inquiry
as
to
what
sort
of
information
must
be
provided
accompanying
payment
of
the
excise
tax
in
the
grosso
case
and
order
to
affect
registration
and
the
correlative
payment
of
special
occupational
tax
in
the
marchetti
case.
we
take
the
position
that
the
forms
that
are
prescribed
for
use,
form
11-c
as
to
registration,
form
730
is
the
excise
tax
must
be
completed
and
filed
along
with
payment
and
registration.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
order
for
a
tax
scheme
to
operate
in
a
sensible
way,
certain
information
has
to
be
obtained
by
the
government.
the
business
of
an
anonymous
payment,
it
seems
to
us
not
to
be
a
feasible
one.
now,
underlying
the
problem
here,
mr.
zeldes
didn't
speak
to
it
directly.
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
it.
the
problem
is
that
almost
anything
you
require
someone
to
do,
if
you
require
him
to
put
his
name
down
on
the
thing,
they
are
going
to
claim
that
that's
enough.
mr.
chief
justice
you
tried
to
develop
this
this
morning.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
answer.
if
the
root
--
the
answer
is,
well
no
we
can't
even
be
required
to
put
our
name
on
the
form
because
if
we
put
our
name
on
the
form
they
may
come
about
knowledge
of
us
that
they
wouldn't
have
otherwise.
well,
i
don't
know
how
else
you
administer
a
tax
scheme.
our
position
is
that
if
we
can
at
least
have
the
people
that
are
required
to
pay
the
tax
identify
them
then
the
tax
scheme
is
not
workable
or
feasible.
therefore
that's
the
reason
why
we
take
the
position
we
do
as
to
the
second
set
of
inquiries
that
the
court
has
posed.
several
other
points
were
raised
during
prior
argument
that
i'd
like
to
mention,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
posed
as
to
the
applicability
of
shapiro
in
the
income
tax
context
is
a
difficult
one.
i
don't
think
it's
raised
here
either.
i
think
its
proper
if
the
court
considers
the
implications
of
fifth
amendment
decisions
in
the
east
cases,
in
subsequent
case
that
are
going
to
come
along.
we
tried
to
develop
in
our
reargument
brief
to
point
that
the
--
despite
the
claims
that
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
sullivan
and
not
to
worry
about
the
income
tax.
in
a
term
or
two,
if
kahriger
and
lewis
are
not
followed,
these
cases
are
going
to
be
out
there.
now,
one
answer
is
well,
deal
with
them
when
they
come.
it
seems
to
us
that
albertson
and
its
reading
of
the
fifth
amendment
opens
up
this
whole
array
of
problems.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
inquiry
about
shapiro
and
the
records
that
are
required
to
be
kept,
i
think
i
would
give
substantially
the
same
answers
as
mr.
zeldes'
gave.
it
may
be
that
as
to
certain
people
that
are
required
to
keep
records
incident
to
the
income
tax
laws,
they
would
have
a
privilege
but
its
quite
clear
then
either
that
shapiro
doesn't
stand
for
its
brought
a
proposition
to
some
people,
i
think
it
does
or
if
the
court
in
taking
that
position
would
be
effectively
restricting
in
limiting
shapiro.
now,
we
don't
rely
on
shapiro
affirmatively
here
but
we
do
point
out
that
the
court
was
faced
with
a
similar
problem
in
that
case.
i
know
it's
an
old
case.
but
the
problem
there
was
that
the
government
had
a
program
that
required
people
to
keep
certain
things
as
records.
the
question
was
whether
those
records
had
the
kind
of
character
that
they
could
be
used
by
the
government
in
a
prosecution.
and
the
court
concluded
that
they
could,
concluded
that
they
could
because
those
records
had
certain
public
aspects.
now,
as
i
have
said
previously
it
seems
to
us
that
one
way
to
consider
shapiro
in
light
of
the
background
of
that
case
is
that
the
records
of
the
court
there
was
talking
about
are
those
records
that
are
ordinarily
and
customarily
kept.
but
i
don't
know
that
the
answers
the
problem
that
mr.
justice
fortas
read.
it
seems
to
me
that
most
taxpayers
keep
certain
records
whether
the
activity
they
engaged
in
is
lawful
or
unlawful.
and
the
problem
of
course
that
you're
faced
with
then
is
whether
shapiro
provides
that
these
kinds
of
records
regardless
of
the
framework
of
the
activity
are
within
or
without
the
privilege.
it
seems
to
us
that
rather
than
anticipate
an
answer
to
that
the
better
course
is
to
keep
in
mind
these
difficulties
in
resolving
the
problem
here
because
there
isn't
or
there
isn't
any
need
to
resolve
it.
they
are
--
they're
in
the
background
and
they're
going
to
present
themselves
eventually.
justice
hugo

black
kahriger
or
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
see
any
distinction
between
the
questions
in
the
two
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
government
could
impo
--
both
impose
and
collect
tax
on
gambling
without
requiring
registration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
see
a
real
difference
seeing
how
the
government
to
do
those
two
things,
to
collect
the
tax
on
gambling
and
to
require
the
person
who's
engaged
in
gambling
to
(inaudible)
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
causes
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
it
--
was
that
one
of
the
--
it
seem
to
be
what
mr.
justice
holmes
was
holding
in
his
original
case
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
in
this
question
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
see
anything
in
it
that
indicates
the
difference
in
what
a
man
has
to
admit
and
what
he
doesn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
drew
it,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
he
drew
it
pretty
clearly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
pay
the
law
--
the
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
pay
the
tax
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
require
--
does
it
say
anything
--
hold
anything
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
file
a
return
but
it
say,
he's
got
to
say
he
got
it
from
gambling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
rather
careful
if
you
refer
it
from
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
involved,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
return
--
they
required
them
to
confess
to
something,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
illegal
sale
of
whisky?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
is
of
course
a
very
decisive
distinction
between
a
law
which
requires
you
to
confess,
you
may
have
committed
a
crime.
a
law
which
could
--
requires
you
to
report
to
the
government
that
you
owe
it
so
much
taxes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
it's
a
part
of
it
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
of
it
might
not
be
valid
and
some
of
it
might.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
stand
on
that
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
would
admit
that
the
taxation
of
a
business
which
is
generally
known
to
be
criminal,
rather
a
large
part
of
the
united
states
is
rather
far
stretched
from
the
general
governmental
idea
that
you're
attacking.
business
for
the
purpose
of
giving
money
and
will
not
in
anyway
encourage
the
commission
of
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
there
been
any
study
made
of
any
kind
on
the
amount
of
money
that
united
states
government
gets
out
of
taxing
crimes,
in
connection
with
what
it
calls
to
collecting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
state
that
legalizes
that
business
of
narcotics?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
difference,
doesn't
it?
quite
a
difference
in
the
government
going
out
to
help
the
states
enforce
their
policy
which
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
guarantees
them
to
carry
on
and
taking
the
absence
of
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
authorizing
something
to
be
done,
the
great
power
of
the
federal
government,
which
under
the
provision
and
the
powers
between
the
states
and
the
nation
belongs
to
the
state
to
control,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course
it
interfered
with
the
prohibition
laws
when
the
federal
government
licensed
every
bootleg
in
the
united
states
and
let
them
put
it
up
in
flaming
colors
in
the
place
of
the
business,
that
they
were
licensed
to
sell
it
in
(inaudible)
when
the
state
law
forbad
it.
what
harm
would
it
do
the
government
to
keep
its
hands
on
taxing
things
that
it
does
not
permit
to
be
made
illegal
by
the
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
you're
too
done
but
you
--
you
come
down,
now
you're
saying
that
the
federal
government
shouldn't
be
running
in
opposition
to
the
state
in
connection
with
the
enforcement
of
governmental
policies
that
the
state
rightfully
think
it
has
the
power
to
regulate
in
those
regulations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
its
--
there's
a
difference
in
enforcing
this
federal
law
in
the
state
that
legalizes
gambling
and
one
which
does
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
difference
of
the
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
possible
that
the
law
not
be
valid
in
those
states
that
permit
gambling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
should
the
man
there
be
allowed
to
claim
any
privilege,
in
nevada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
couldn't
claim
could
he
that
he
was
going
to
be
prosecuted
in
nevada.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
for
gambling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
that
instance
if
the
state,
the
federal
government
would
be
aiding
nevada
to
carry
out
its
state
recognize
local
state
powers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
may
not
be
that
it
has
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
state
but
there
are
some
--
something
to
--
a
concept
i
should
think
that
in
a
union
of
states,
the
form
of
national
federal
government,
there's
something
to
them,
the
idea
that
the
federal
government
ought
to
be
barred
in
trying
to
frustrate
the
policies
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
how
it
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
gives
them
a
license
to
engage
in
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ever
hear
anybody
suggest
that
there's
any
possibility
that
they
get
any
net
tax
gain
out
of
that
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
means
if
--
does
that
not
mean
that
the
purpose
was
to
bar
gambling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
they
call
it
as
a
tax,
that
what
in
the
attitude
it
is
there's
a
method
of
helping
to
regulate
gambling,
isn't
it?
it
can't
be
a
tax
if
you
don't
collect
it
as
i
gather
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
men
there
are
in
the
revenue
department,
devote
that
services
trying
to
enforce
this
particular
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
suggesting
that
the
court
provides
the
right
of
some
kind
of
immunization
scheming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
be
a
kind
of
immunization,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
that
the
power
of
congress
if
there
is
such
a
power
to
grant
immunity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
grace
was
referred
--
decided
question,
the
government's
policy.
they
have
not
yet
decided
to
grant
any
governmental
immunity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
amount
to
that,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
were
to
do
that
and
congress
to
come
along
and
pass
the
law
and
say
we
do
not
want
any
such
relief
given
and
if
it's
immunity
which
was
in
my
judgment
be
immunity
from
prosecutions,
which
one
would
prevail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
law
or
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
agree
to
that.
i
agree
to
the
kind
of
immunity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
there
be
a
constitutional
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
subtitle?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
special
law
with
reference
to
that,
they're
making
it
sub
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
only.
justice
hugo
l.
black
becoming
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
deny
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
the
government
anywhere
forthrightly
argues
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
construed
for
the
reason,
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
except
in
crimes
that
involves
the
payment
of
taxes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
argue
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
a
--
in
other
words,
if
a
need
to
collect
taxes
means
that
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
mean
what
it
says
when
it
says
that
no
person
should
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
little
strange
to
worry
about
miranda
(inaudible)
if
that's
cleared.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
says
that
congress
shall
not
be
(inaudible)?
fifth
amendment,
doesn't
say
that?
doesn't
it
say
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
how
can
you
accommodate
that,
a
way
--
in
the
way
you
do
that
--
the
feeling,
the
amendment
to
that
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
make
it
unenforceable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
used
of
the
statement
when
a
man
is
compelled
by
the
government
to
make
the
conviction
of
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
accommodate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
can
the
court
repeal
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
just
makes
it
unenforceable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
designed
to
protect
him
from
being
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that'd
be,
if
you
grant
immunity,
you
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
no
immunity
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
be
a
thing
for
congress
to
do,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
do
i
understand
then
that
what
all
the
government
is
asking
is
that
we
provide
that
a
man
should
be
granted
immunity
from
any
prosecution
before
he
is
compelled
to
answer
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
thrust
of
the
question
is,
i'm
asking,
do
you
--
if
you
want
to
do
it
in
that
way,
you
provide
--
are
you
asking
us
to
provide
the
rules
which
--
to
the
effect
any
man
who
makes
one
of
this
tax
returns,
they'll
be
exempt
from
prosecution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
immunity
from
prosecution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
about
the
length
of
the
lead,
does
it?
that
passes
out
the
window
under
the
present
argument
because
here
the
man
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself,
that
he
has
committed
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it's
not
a
question
of
a
lien?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
would
you
say
on
your
return?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
make
false
statements?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
have
you
been
compelled
there
to
commit
a
crime?
how
do
say
that,
i
mean
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
light
of
(inaudible)
that's
right
but
is
that
the
standard
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
you
are
saying
that
if
you
have
got
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
conclude
that
in
order
to
implement
this
rule
and
accommodate
the
interest
of
the
state
and
federal
governments,
the
federal
government
must
be
prohibited
to
make
any
such
use
of
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
referred
to
the
restriction
on
use,
in
the
blue
case
the
court
said
even
if
we
assume
the
government
did
in
--
did
acquire
incriminating
evidence
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
blue
would
at
most
be
entitled
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
its
fruits
if
they
were
sought
to
be
used
against
him
at
trial.
there's
a
similar
statement
in
adams
versus
maryland.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
they
sought
a
rule
if
the
court
feels
that
kahriger
and
lewis
are
not
consistent.
fifth
amendment
as
presently
understood
would
provide
a
sensible
accommodation
not
only
in
these
cases
but
in
the
other
cases
in
which
albertson
may
have
some
difficulty
in
the
future
implications.
your
alternative
is
if
this
(inaudible)
congress
can't
put
an
excise
tax
on
gambling
unless
it
immunizes
these
gamblers
from
any
possible
incrimination.
and
i
don't
know
why
in
the
face
of
murphy
it's
not
appropriate
for
the
court
to
adopt
or
use
the
restriction
rule.
we
developed
at
length
that
seems
to
us
that
that
--
that
is
a
sound
and
a
sensible
position.
i
would
like
for
a
few
moments,
since
this
is
on
reargument
to
discuss
the
questions
that
the
court
posed
and
asked
to
have
dscussed
in
our
briefs
and
oral
argument.
we
take
the
position
as
mr.
zeldes
has
pointed
out
that
in
our
view
the
shapiro
case
is
not
of
direct
relevance
here.
as
we
read
and
understand
shapiro
it
relates
to
the
so-called
required
records
doctrine.
a
requirement
that
certain
records
be
maintained
and
kept
and
be
available
for
inspection
by
the
government.
and
we
think
that's
a
different
situation
from
one
in
which
the
government
requires
and
individual
to
affirmatively
come
forth
and
make
reports
or
returns
to
the
government.
it
seems
to
us
that
shapiro
has
it
is
evolved
over
the
years
as
understood
and
to
mean
in
the
context
in
which
it
arose.
the
court
pointed
out
in
shapiro
that
the
regulation
there
involved
records
that
were
customarily
and
regularly
kept.
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
an
appropriate
improper
view
of
shapiro.
the
alternative
of
saying
that
shapiro
is
applicable
any
time
the
government
requires
anything
to
be
filed
with
the
--
it
seems
to
us,
the
lack
of
any
sensible
limitations.
we
therefore
don't
argue
that,
is
that
reliable?
now
there
is
a
potential
shapiro
problem
with
respect
to
the
wagering
tax
as
we
point
out,
there's
a
section
of
the
wagering
tax
statute,
section
4403
that
provides
for
the
keeping
of
daily
records
of
the
wagering
activity.
that
statute
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
now
the
courts
below
in
this
or
in
the
grosso
case
considered
4403
and
petitioners
were
not
charged
with
failing
to
keep
such
records
nor
were
any
records
of
either
of
the
petitioners
along
those
lines
and
produced
against
them.
there
may
be
an
appropriate
case
in
which
this
question
comes
out
in
which
the
application
of
shapiro
is
involved.
it's
not
this
case
and
it
seems
to
us
that
there's
no
need
presently
to
get
to
that.
the
other
question
involves
the
inquiry
as
to
what
sort
of
information
must
be
provided
accompanying
payment
of
the
excise
tax
in
the
grosso
case
and
order
to
affect
registration
and
the
correlative
payment
of
special
occupational
tax
in
the
marchetti
case.
we
take
the
position
that
the
forms
that
are
prescribed
for
use,
form
11-c
as
to
registration,
form
730
is
the
excise
tax
must
be
completed
and
filed
along
with
payment
and
registration.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
order
for
a
tax
scheme
to
operate
in
a
sensible
way,
certain
information
has
to
be
obtained
by
the
government.
the
business
of
an
anonymous
payment,
it
seems
to
us
not
to
be
a
feasible
one.
now,
underlying
the
problem
here,
mr.
zeldes
didn't
speak
to
it
directly.
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
it.
the
problem
is
that
almost
anything
you
require
someone
to
do,
if
you
require
him
to
put
his
name
down
on
the
thing,
they
are
going
to
claim
that
that's
enough.
mr.
chief
justice
you
tried
to
develop
this
this
morning.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
answer.
if
the
root
--
the
answer
is,
well
no
we
can't
even
be
required
to
put
our
name
on
the
form
because
if
we
put
our
name
on
the
form
they
may
come
about
knowledge
of
us
that
they
wouldn't
have
otherwise.
well,
i
don't
know
how
else
you
administer
a
tax
scheme.
our
position
is
that
if
we
can
at
least
have
the
people
that
are
required
to
pay
the
tax
identify
them
then
the
tax
scheme
is
not
workable
or
feasible.
therefore
that's
the
reason
why
we
take
the
position
we
do
as
to
the
second
set
of
inquiries
that
the
court
has
posed.
several
other
points
were
raised
during
prior
argument
that
i'd
like
to
mention,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
posed
as
to
the
applicability
of
shapiro
in
the
income
tax
context
is
a
difficult
one.
i
don't
think
it's
raised
here
either.
i
think
its
proper
if
the
court
considers
the
implications
of
fifth
amendment
decisions
in
the
east
cases,
in
subsequent
case
that
are
going
to
come
along.
we
tried
to
develop
in
our
reargument
brief
to
point
that
the
--
despite
the
claims
that
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
sullivan
and
not
to
worry
about
the
income
tax.
in
a
term
or
two,
if
kahriger
and
lewis
are
not
followed,
these
cases
are
going
to
be
out
there.
now,
one
answer
is
well,
deal
with
them
when
they
come.
it
seems
to
us
that
albertson
and
its
reading
of
the
fifth
amendment
opens
up
this
whole
array
of
problems.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
inquiry
about
shapiro
and
the
records
that
are
required
to
be
kept,
i
think
i
would
give
substantially
the
same
answers
as
mr.
zeldes'
gave.
it
may
be
that
as
to
certain
people
that
are
required
to
keep
records
incident
to
the
income
tax
laws,
they
would
have
a
privilege
but
its
quite
clear
then
either
that
shapiro
doesn't
stand
for
its
brought
a
proposition
to
some
people,
i
think
it
does
or
if
the
court
in
taking
that
position
would
be
effectively
restricting
in
limiting
shapiro.
now,
we
don't
rely
on
shapiro
affirmatively
here
but
we
do
point
out
that
the
court
was
faced
with
a
similar
problem
in
that
case.
i
know
it's
an
old
case.
but
the
problem
there
was
that
the
government
had
a
program
that
required
people
to
keep
certain
things
as
records.
the
question
was
whether
those
records
had
the
kind
of
character
that
they
could
be
used
by
the
government
in
a
prosecution.
and
the
court
concluded
that
they
could,
concluded
that
they
could
because
those
records
had
certain
public
aspects.
now,
as
i
have
said
previously
it
seems
to
us
that
one
way
to
consider
shapiro
in
light
of
the
background
of
that
case
is
that
the
records
of
the
court
there
was
talking
about
are
those
records
that
are
ordinarily
and
customarily
kept.
but
i
don't
know
that
the
answers
the
problem
that
mr.
justice
fortas
read.
it
seems
to
me
that
most
taxpayers
keep
certain
records
whether
the
activity
they
engaged
in
is
lawful
or
unlawful.
and
the
problem
of
course
that
you're
faced
with
then
is
whether
shapiro
provides
that
these
kinds
of
records
regardless
of
the
framework
of
the
activity
are
within
or
without
the
privilege.
it
seems
to
us
that
rather
than
anticipate
an
answer
to
that
the
better
course
is
to
keep
in
mind
these
difficulties
in
resolving
the
problem
here
because
there
isn't
or
there
isn't
any
need
to
resolve
it.
they
are
--
they're
in
the
background
and
they're
going
to
present
themselves
eventually.
