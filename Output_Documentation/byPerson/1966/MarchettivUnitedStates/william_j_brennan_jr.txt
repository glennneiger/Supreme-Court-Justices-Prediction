and
inform
that
the
basis
of
that
(inaudible)
in
sullivan
the
questions
that
they
used
from
is
(inaudible)
distinction
is
the

as
to
the

the

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

both.
justice
william
j.

now,
would
it
be
accurate

(inaudible)
that
the

of
the
(inaudible)

limited.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
is
(inaudible)
on

is
not

(inaudible)
either

any

doesn't

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
if
that
--
if
that's
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

the

would
mean
that
you
can
get

justice
william

in

brennan,

and
so
does
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
shapiro
would
permit
that?
do
you
think
that
such
a
holding
has
any
relevance
whatsoever
to
the
situation
where
the

says,
“now
look,
we
don't
want

having

subpoena
these

we
want
you
to

exactly
what
we
could
come

justice
william
j.
brennan,

may
be
i'm
wondering
if
--
so
you're
approach
or
use
restriction
idea,
as
a
practical
matter,
do
you
suppose
any
prosecution
would
succeed
with
--
if
on
the
basis
of
the
use
restriction,
the
stamp
tax
affirmed,
it
was
sustained,
now
--
i'm
just
wondering
if
that
stamp
or
whatever
that
thing
is,
has
to
be
posted
on
the
premises,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wonder
if
it
could
if
--
the
burden
on
the
state
or
the
federal
government's
case
might
be
would
be
to
show
that
it
came
about
its
evidence
by
some
independent
source
and
its
basic
attack
by
compliance
with
the
stamp
tax
requirement,
the
defendant
has
posted
this
thing
for
all
the
world
to
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
my
question
--
i'm
just
wondering
how
successful
any
prosecuting
authority
would
be
in
sustaining
his
burden
to
the
show
that
it
came
about
this
information
from
an
independent
source
and
faces
the
fact
that
there's
the
stamp,
i
am
a
gambler,
placed
it
right
on
the
front
door.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
wondering
if
they'd
succeed
in
prosecution,
that's
my
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
very
nice
to
federal
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i
wonder
what
the
state
authorities
then
under

if
they
want
to
prosecute
him
for
gambling
and
showing
that
they
came
about

i
wonder
what
they
would,
how
nice
they
would
think
it
would.
justice

j.
brennan,

well,
it
says,

there,
would
it?
