justice

j.
brennan,

is
that
the
actual
language?
"oh,
that
wicked
fellow,
he
had
killed
him?"
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
oh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
sounds
from
an
1890
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
done
it
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i'm
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wondered
mr.
schafer,
rereading
mr.
justice
08.15
opinion.
do
i
read
this
correctly
as
stating
that
the
question
for
the
court's
decision
based
on
this
finding
on
the
post-conviction
hearing
is
whether
within
the
state's
statute
that
that
was
conduct
which
deprived
the
petitioner
a
fair
trial
under
the
constitutions
of
the
state
of
oregon
or
the
constitution
of
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
went
on
simply
to
hold
that
the
--
and
its
judgment,
this
was
not
a
denial
of
any
federal
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
do
we
get
into
admission
of
--
in
some
of
the
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
schafer,
may
i
ask
you.
i
noticed
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
court's
opinion,
i'm
looking
at
13a
of
the
record
cites
ausplund,
a-u-s-p-l-u-n-d,
an
oregon
decision
and
in
its
discussion
of
it
concludes
with
the
decision
of
the
court
in
effect
was
that
such
evidence
would
not
even
be
received
for
the
reason
that
it
would
destroy
the
finality
with
the
jury's
verdict.
this
gets
back
to
what
mr.
justice
harlan
was
asking
you
earlier.
i
think
you
answered
justice
harlan
that
this
doesn't
suggest
that
this
turned
on
a
state
ground
namely
that
a
juror
would
not
be
allowed
by
this
kind
of
evidence
to
impeach
his
verdict.
doesn't
ask
this
--
the
way
the
court
treats
or
response
suggest
that
that
if
that
may
be
the
oregon
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
since
ausplund
was
another
case
of
a
juror,
whom
--
three
jurors
who
made
affidavits.
this
means
that
a
juror's
evidence
to
that
effect
would
not
be
received
in
evidence.
not
that
you
can't
prove
it
otherwise,
but
you
can't
prove
it
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
jurors
who
sat
on
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
if
this
citation
of
ausplund
as
they
suggest
that
it
wasn't.
and
that
one
ground
of
the
reversal
by
the
supreme
court
was
that
that
kind
of
evidence
could
not
be
received.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.

you
said
