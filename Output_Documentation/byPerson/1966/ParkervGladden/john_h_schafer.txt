mr.
john
h.
schafer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
we
have
before
you
on
this
case
is
whether
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
was
correct
in
holding
that
it's
fourteenth
amendment
obligation
to
afford
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
was
not
violated
in
affirming
a
conviction
for
second
degree
murder
when
three
jurors
were
told
by
an
officer
of
the
state
during
the
course
of
the
trial
that
the
defendant
was
in
fact
guilty.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
you
have
to
think
your
honor
that
it
may
have
been
sifted
down
a
little
bit.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
just
came
through
though.
i
don't
know.
i
can't
tell
you.
it
does
sound
remarkable.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
have
to
agree.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
have
to
agree.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
--
i
believe
in
any
dispute
whatever.
this
petitioner
was
once
tried
for
first
degree
murder.
he
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
that
conviction
was
set
aside
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
a
new
trial
was
had
in
which
the
event
occurred
which
brings
the
case
to
this
court.
that
new
trial
again
resulted
in
a
conviction
for
second
degree
murder.
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
that
conviction
was
subsequently
affirmed
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
after
that
affirmance
petitioner
instituted
pursuant
to
oregon
statute
a
post-conviction
hearing
in
which
he
alleged
a
number
of
things.
and
in
which
he
proved
that
in
the
words
of
the
trial
court
and
--
or
the
hearing
court
i
should
say,
i'm
reading
page
197
of
the
record.
that
the
bailiff
of
the
state
of
oregon
said
to
three
jurors,
two
or
three
jurors
in
effect,
“oh,
that
wicked
fellow.
he
is
guilty”,
and
also
said
to
them,
“if
you
find
him
guilty
and
there's
anything
wrong,
the
supreme
court
will
correct
it”.
now
in
spite
of
that
odd
language,
there
was
the
finding
made
by
the
hearing
court
that
those
things
were
in
fact
said
--
that
they
were
in
fact
said
to
two
or
three
jurors.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
was
coming
to
that
your
honor,
it
is.
it
is
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
is
that
that
bailiff
had
the
jury
in
charge
for
an
eight-day
trial.
the
hearing
court
went
on
to
find,
i
think,
he
didn't
have
to
but
he
went
on
to
find
that
these
facts
in
fact
had
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
and
consistently
with
that
finding,
he
ordered
that
the
conviction
be
set
aside
and
a
new
trial
be
granted.
the
oregon
supreme
court
reversed
that
finding
by
the
hearing
court
and
affirmed
the
conviction
and
reversed
the
new
trial
ruling.
at
that
appeal,
the
state's
appeal
on
the
--
on
that
hearing
court's
ruling,
the
federal
question
was
explicitly
raised.
there's
no
contention
made
here
that
the
petitioner
did
not
raise
the
federal
question
in
the
oregon
supreme
court.
the
oregon
supreme
court
decision
cannot
be
read
in
my
judgment
in
any
way
other
than
to
say
in
effect
that
petitioner
was
afforded
a
fourteenth
amendment
trial
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
an
officer
of
the
state
of
oregon
in
effect
went
into
the
jury
room
and
told
two
or
three
jurors
the
defendant
was
guilty.
i
don't
see
how
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
decisions
to
be
interpreted
in
any
way
and
on
that
interpretation
i
submit
that
citations
of
authority
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
is
almost
completely
unnecessary.
if
citation
is
authority,
i
should
like
to
call
to
your
honors
attention
the
case
of
turner
versus
louisiana
which
you
decided
two
terms
ago.
and
in
turner,
you
may
recall
that
was
an
8
to
1
decision
with
only
justice
clark
dissenting.
in
turner,
two
sheriffs
who
had
custody
of
the
jury
also
testified
for
the
prosecution.
and
this
court
held
and
on
those
facts
and
without
more
that
that
was
the
kind
of
situation
which
was
so
inherently
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
that
it
was
not
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
obligations
on
the
states.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
did
say
that
your
honor.
yes,
i
did
say
it.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
they
were
prosecution
witnesses
and
they
were
in
custody
of
this
--
of
the
jury.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct
your
honor.
let
me
say
however,
in
response
to
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
question.
in
theory,
you
had
only
a
three-day
trial
which
those
bailiffs
or
sheriffs
were
in
custody.
here
you
have
an
eight-day
trial
and
this
bailiff
was
in
constant
and
intimate
contact
with
that
jury
for
eight
solid
days.
the
bailiff
then
said
to
the
jurors
“this
defendant
is
guilty”.
moreover,
you
have
here
flat
proof
of
finding
a
fact
made
by
the
hearing
court
that
prejudicial
statements
were
made
by
the
state
officer
and
in
turn
you
hadn't
--
didn't
have
any
evidence
of
that
at
all.
and
moreover
i
think
i
may
fairly
say
that
in
this
case
the
jurors
deliberated
for
26
hours
and
i
think
that
can
fairly
be
said
to
indicate
some
real
questions
about
the
ultimate
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
now,
the
state's
arguments
in
support
of
this
holding
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
are
i
believe
without
any
merit.
the
state
first
suggests
that
finality
ought
to
be
accorded
to
jury
verdicts.
but
there
isn't
any
rule
in
the
state
of
oregon
which
would
enshrine
jury
verdicts
to
this
extent.
the
state
versus
gardner
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
a
few
terms
ago
very
recently
in
oregon,
lays
down
the
general
rule
that's
been
applied
in
most
jurisdictions
that
that
evidence
of
this
kind
is
admissible
to
impeach
a
jury
verdict.
that
evidence
of
the
reasoning
process,
the
thought
process
of
jurors
that's
not
admissible.
but
evidence
of
overt
acts
which
can
be
proved
or
disproved
by
other
witnesses,
that
kind
of
evidence
is
admissible.
that's
the
law
of
oregon.
mr.
justice
brennan
when
he
was
on
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
wrote
a
very
detailed
and
considerate
opinion
in
which
basically
he
came
to
the
same
result
to
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
that's
the
general
rule
and
some
of
the
rule
of
oregon.
and
there
isn't
the
kind
of
rule
of
finality
which
the
state
would
now
have
you
believe.
and
moreover
mind
you,
in
this
case,
the
evidence
of
the
bailiff
statements
did
come
from
jurors.
three
jurors
testified
to
the
effect
these
statements
were
made.
but
the
state
never
suggested
that
that
evidence
because
it
came
from
jurors
was
inadmissible
that
these
jurors
were
impeaching
their
verdict
and
they
could
not
be
heard
to
impeach
their
verdict.
that's
not
the
state
rule
in
oregon.
the
hearing
court
didn't
suggest
that
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
didn't
suggest
that.
and
moreover,
i
would
say
that
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
if
this
were
this
rule
of
oregon
and
if
this
rule
were
applied
to
foreclose
proof
and
judicial
actions
thereon
and
it
may
--
suggested
by
the
state,
they
will
be
unconstitutionally
applied.
and
you
couldn't
have
a
state
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
their
decision
your
honor.
and
now
this
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
would
suggest
myself
to
the
arguments
made
by
the
state
in
its
brief.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
state
in
its
brief
in
a
way
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
can
definitely
state
to
the
court
is
suggesting
two
lines
of
argument
and
seems
to
combine
the
two
into
an
ultimate
conclusion.
in
other
words,
it's
suggesting
the
argument
of
finality
which
i've
just
--
been
suggesting
myself
to.
and
there
is
also
just
saying
in
effect
which
i
want
to
come
to
in
a
second,
but
anyway
there
wasn't
any
prejudice.
and
then
the
state
in
his
brief
says,
what
the
state
--
the
court
in
oregon
did
was
to
balance
these
two,
and
say,
we
ought
to
have
finality
and
it
really
wasn't
very
much
prejudice,
so
it's
all
okay.
and
i'm
just
taking
the
two
points
made
by
the
state
in
his
brief
and
analyzing
separately.
now
as
they
say,
the
finality
argument
i
think
this
without
a
merit.
and
the
state
as
i
have
said
goes
on
to
say,
“well,
anyway
there
wasn't
any
prejudice.
there
wasn't
any
prejudice
here
to
this
defendant”.
and
there
are
three
things
wrong
with
that
argument.
the
first
is
as
i've
said
the
hearing
court
found
as
in
fact
there
was
prejudice.
and
the
second
thing
wrong
with
it
is,
there
is
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
making
it
perfectly
clear
we
submit
that
in
circumstances
such
as
this,
it
isn't
necessary
for
a
defendant
to
assume
the
burden
of
proving
actual
prejudice.
this
court's
decision
starting
with
tumey
versus
ohio
running
through
turner
and
louisiana
including
irvin
v.
dowd,
estes,
sheppard;
all
those
cases
established
the
proposition
that
where
the
circumstances
are
as
here
so
inherently
prejudicial.
it
isn't
necessary
in
order
to
establish
a
constitutional
right
that
the
defendant
assumed
the
burden
of
proving
actual
prejudice.
and
finally
on
this
argument
of
prejudice,
i
would
say
simply
that
the
state's
argument
proves
too
much.
it
would
have
us
prove
that
mr.
parker
was
prejudiced.
where
the
only
way
left
to
prove
it
would
be
to
have
a
juror
come
in
and
say,
”yes,
i
was
in
fact
influenced
by
what
that
bailiff
told
me
about
his
guilt”.
well,
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
testimony
of
course
that
almost
everybody
agrees.
the
rules
of
--
uniform
rules
of
evidence
and
everybody
else
agrees.
that
kind
of
evidence
is
not
admissible.
so
that
for
those
reasons,
i
don't
plan
to
talk
any
longer
unless
there
are
questions,
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
the
state's
arguments
are
without
any
merit.
and
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
that's
what
the
state
tries
to
suggest
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
a
very
general
rule
and
it's
not
the
rule
of
oregon
because
state
versus
gardner
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
as
i
was
saying
a
moment
ago,
state
versus
gardner
makes
the
pretty
uniform
distinction
as
to
the
kinds
of
proof
that
are
admissible
and
those
that
are
not,
it's
our
saying.
proof
from
a
juror
as
mental
processes,
he
can't
come
into
a
court
and
say,
“gee,
i
read
and
understand
the
court's
instructions
and
if
i
had
i
would
have
voted
the
other
way”.
that's
pretty
universally
condemned.
but
it's
universally
held,
i
believe
that
a
juror
can
come
into
a
court
and
say,
“we
were
offered
bribes",
or
"people
said
things
to
us",
or
any
of
those
other
facts,
overt
facts,
overt
acts,
proof
of
overt
acts
which
can
be
proved
or
disproved
to
testimonial
process.
testimonial
process,
i
should
say.
those
kinds
of
facts
are
admissible
and
that's
the
rule
of
the
state
of
oregon
as
i've
stated
in
the
state
versus
gardner.
and
that's
a
rule
that
mr.
justice
brennan
as
i
said
wrote
a
decision
which
nicely
summarizes
the
history
of
this
problem
in
the
cases
in
--
when
he
was
on
the
jersey
court.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
and
that's
the
standard
rule.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
--
my
--
our
claim
is
your
honor
that
where
the
circumstances
are
so
likely
to
cause
prejudice,
that
it's
not
necessary
to
prove
actual
prejudice.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
testimony
of
the
hearing
--
post-conviction
hearing
mr.
justice
white
was
a
little
confused
and
there
were
three
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
there
were
two
or
three.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no
more
than
that.
no.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes.
well,
two
or
three
regulars
probably
heard
it
and
one
alternate.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
mr.
justice
white.
the
testimony
was
--
there
was
no
finding
made
out
of
it
but
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
we
don't
know
that.
they
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no.
no,
there's
was
not.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
two
things
if
i
might
say
that
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
first
is
your
assumption
of
fact
is
not
quite
correct
on
the
record
but
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
sorry.
i
understood
you
were
addressing
yourself
to
the
record.
and
the
second
thing
as
i
would
say
that
kind
of
evidence,
yes
i
was
affected,
no
i
wasn't
affected.
that's
inadmissible.
i
believe
in
every
jurisdiction,
if
you
--
inadmissible
under
the
uniform
rules
of
evidence
and
perhaps
the
reason
is
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
so
that
a
juror
may
not
be
allowed
to
impeach
his
own
verdict
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
because
a
juror
really
is
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
--
the
turner
rule
to
my
mind
means
that
you
assume
prejudice
because
these
facts
occurred.
now,
i'm
asking
you
here
to
apply
the
turner
rule
to
assume
prejudice
because
three
jurors
heard
an
officer
of
the
state
say,
“this
man
was
guilty”.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
right.
that's
right
your
honor.
because
who
want
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
assume
he
was
not?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
assume
he
was?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that
he
was
present?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
prejudiced.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
hear
him
say
whether
he
was
prejudice
or
not.
i
think
for
one
thing
no
juror
can
adequately
say.
who
--
what
--
one
of
us
can
say,
what
influences
us
and
what
doesn't.
and
isn't
a
natural
tendency
to
say,
i'm
not
influenced
by
things
i
hear.
i've
got
my
own
mouth
--
mind
and
i
can
make
it
up
myself.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
they're
tended
to.
as
i
understand
oregon
law
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
that
was
unanimous
verdict,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
sorry,
unanimous
verdict.
and
i
should
--
what
i
wanted
to
say
a
minute
ago
mr.
justice
white
was
that
one
of
these
jurors
wasn't
able
to
say
one
way
or
the
other,
whether
she
had
been
prejudiced
by
what
she
heard.
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
page
1
--
excuse
me.
excuse
me.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
if
i
read
--
it
--
let
me
say
this.
if
it
is
the
oregon
rule
that
you
cannot
prove
this
kind
of
conduct
for
one
reason
or
another
then
it
seems
to
me
that
rule
is
unconstitutional,
if
it
forecloses
the
kind
of
proof
and
the
judicial
action
necessary
to
taking
thereon
as
it
indicated
by
this
case?
if
the
oregon
law
is,
that
this
petitioner
cannot
prove
that
a
state
officer
went
in
and
told
three
jurors
that
he
was
guilty
during
the
course
of
the
trial
then
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
that
rule
is
applied
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well
mr.
justice
brennan,
no
one
--
as
i
said
nobody
in
this
case
ever
said
that
this
juror's
testimony
wasn't
admissible.
it
wasn't
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i
didn't
understand.
i
only
have
a
fair
reading
of
the
decision
indicates
that
and
i
must
say
that
state
versus
gardner
which
comes
subsequent
to
the
ausplund
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
think
it
is
really
on
all
fours
from
your
decision
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
state
versus
(inaudible)
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
and
that
indicates
i
think
without
any
doubt
whatever
that
the
oregon
rule
is
that
this
kind
of
evidence
is
admissible
through
jurors
or
otherwise.
and
however
you
read
ausplund;
i
think
it
--
if
it
says
that
it's
overruled
by
gardner.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
oregon
court
in
this
case
is
saying,
"we've
got
adequate
state
grounds
on
which
to
foreclose,
on
which
--
upon
which
we
can
foreclose".
and
otherwise
a
valid
constitutional
claim.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
would
just
say
in
response
to
your
honor,
chief
justice
to
the
last
question
on
page
204
of
the
record.
there
appears
a
statement
by
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
that
it
is
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
its
decision
that
the
petitioner
did
raise
the
issue
of
misconduct
as
soon
as
it
could
--
as
soon
as
he
could.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
we
have
before
you
on
this
case
is
whether
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
was
correct
in
holding
that
it's
fourteenth
amendment
obligation
to
afford
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
was
not
violated
in
affirming
a
conviction
for
second
degree
murder
when
three
jurors
were
told
by
an
officer
of
the
state
during
the
course
of
the
trial
that
the
defendant
was
in
fact
guilty.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
you
have
to
think
your
honor
that
it
may
have
been
sifted
down
a
little
bit.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
just
came
through
though.
i
don't
know.
i
can't
tell
you.
it
does
sound
remarkable.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
have
to
agree.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
have
to
agree.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
--
i
believe
in
any
dispute
whatever.
this
petitioner
was
once
tried
for
first
degree
murder.
he
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
that
conviction
was
set
aside
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
a
new
trial
was
had
in
which
the
event
occurred
which
brings
the
case
to
this
court.
that
new
trial
again
resulted
in
a
conviction
for
second
degree
murder.
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
that
conviction
was
subsequently
affirmed
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
after
that
affirmance
petitioner
instituted
pursuant
to
oregon
statute
a
post-conviction
hearing
in
which
he
alleged
a
number
of
things.
and
in
which
he
proved
that
in
the
words
of
the
trial
court
and
--
or
the
hearing
court
i
should
say,
i'm
reading
page
197
of
the
record.
that
the
bailiff
of
the
state
of
oregon
said
to
three
jurors,
two
or
three
jurors
in
effect,
“oh,
that
wicked
fellow.
he
is
guilty”,
and
also
said
to
them,
“if
you
find
him
guilty
and
there's
anything
wrong,
the
supreme
court
will
correct
it”.
now
in
spite
of
that
odd
language,
there
was
the
finding
made
by
the
hearing
court
that
those
things
were
in
fact
said
--
that
they
were
in
fact
said
to
two
or
three
jurors.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
was
coming
to
that
your
honor,
it
is.
it
is
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
is
that
that
bailiff
had
the
jury
in
charge
for
an
eight-day
trial.
the
hearing
court
went
on
to
find,
i
think,
he
didn't
have
to
but
he
went
on
to
find
that
these
facts
in
fact
had
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
and
consistently
with
that
finding,
he
ordered
that
the
conviction
be
set
aside
and
a
new
trial
be
granted.
the
oregon
supreme
court
reversed
that
finding
by
the
hearing
court
and
affirmed
the
conviction
and
reversed
the
new
trial
ruling.
at
that
appeal,
the
state's
appeal
on
the
--
on
that
hearing
court's
ruling,
the
federal
question
was
explicitly
raised.
there's
no
contention
made
here
that
the
petitioner
did
not
raise
the
federal
question
in
the
oregon
supreme
court.
the
oregon
supreme
court
decision
cannot
be
read
in
my
judgment
in
any
way
other
than
to
say
in
effect
that
petitioner
was
afforded
a
fourteenth
amendment
trial
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
an
officer
of
the
state
of
oregon
in
effect
went
into
the
jury
room
and
told
two
or
three
jurors
the
defendant
was
guilty.
i
don't
see
how
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
decisions
to
be
interpreted
in
any
way
and
on
that
interpretation
i
submit
that
citations
of
authority
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
is
almost
completely
unnecessary.
if
citation
is
authority,
i
should
like
to
call
to
your
honors
attention
the
case
of
turner
versus
louisiana
which
you
decided
two
terms
ago.
and
in
turner,
you
may
recall
that
was
an
8
to
1
decision
with
only
justice
clark
dissenting.
in
turner,
two
sheriffs
who
had
custody
of
the
jury
also
testified
for
the
prosecution.
and
this
court
held
and
on
those
facts
and
without
more
that
that
was
the
kind
of
situation
which
was
so
inherently
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
that
it
was
not
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
obligations
on
the
states.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
did
say
that
your
honor.
yes,
i
did
say
it.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
they
were
prosecution
witnesses
and
they
were
in
custody
of
this
--
of
the
jury.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct
your
honor.
let
me
say
however,
in
response
to
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
question.
in
theory,
you
had
only
a
three-day
trial
which
those
bailiffs
or
sheriffs
were
in
custody.
here
you
have
an
eight-day
trial
and
this
bailiff
was
in
constant
and
intimate
contact
with
that
jury
for
eight
solid
days.
the
bailiff
then
said
to
the
jurors
“this
defendant
is
guilty”.
moreover,
you
have
here
flat
proof
of
finding
a
fact
made
by
the
hearing
court
that
prejudicial
statements
were
made
by
the
state
officer
and
in
turn
you
hadn't
--
didn't
have
any
evidence
of
that
at
all.
and
moreover
i
think
i
may
fairly
say
that
in
this
case
the
jurors
deliberated
for
26
hours
and
i
think
that
can
fairly
be
said
to
indicate
some
real
questions
about
the
ultimate
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
now,
the
state's
arguments
in
support
of
this
holding
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
are
i
believe
without
any
merit.
the
state
first
suggests
that
finality
ought
to
be
accorded
to
jury
verdicts.
but
there
isn't
any
rule
in
the
state
of
oregon
which
would
enshrine
jury
verdicts
to
this
extent.
the
state
versus
gardner
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
a
few
terms
ago
very
recently
in
oregon,
lays
down
the
general
rule
that's
been
applied
in
most
jurisdictions
that
that
evidence
of
this
kind
is
admissible
to
impeach
a
jury
verdict.
that
evidence
of
the
reasoning
process,
the
thought
process
of
jurors
that's
not
admissible.
but
evidence
of
overt
acts
which
can
be
proved
or
disproved
by
other
witnesses,
that
kind
of
evidence
is
admissible.
that's
the
law
of
oregon.
mr.
justice
brennan
when
he
was
on
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
wrote
a
very
detailed
and
considerate
opinion
in
which
basically
he
came
to
the
same
result
to
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
that's
the
general
rule
and
some
of
the
rule
of
oregon.
and
there
isn't
the
kind
of
rule
of
finality
which
the
state
would
now
have
you
believe.
and
moreover
mind
you,
in
this
case,
the
evidence
of
the
bailiff
statements
did
come
from
jurors.
three
jurors
testified
to
the
effect
these
statements
were
made.
but
the
state
never
suggested
that
that
evidence
because
it
came
from
jurors
was
inadmissible
that
these
jurors
were
impeaching
their
verdict
and
they
could
not
be
heard
to
impeach
their
verdict.
that's
not
the
state
rule
in
oregon.
the
hearing
court
didn't
suggest
that
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
didn't
suggest
that.
and
moreover,
i
would
say
that
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
if
this
were
this
rule
of
oregon
and
if
this
rule
were
applied
to
foreclose
proof
and
judicial
actions
thereon
and
it
may
--
suggested
by
the
state,
they
will
be
unconstitutionally
applied.
and
you
couldn't
have
a
state
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
their
decision
your
honor.
and
now
this
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
would
suggest
myself
to
the
arguments
made
by
the
state
in
its
brief.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
state
in
its
brief
in
a
way
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
can
definitely
state
to
the
court
is
suggesting
two
lines
of
argument
and
seems
to
combine
the
two
into
an
ultimate
conclusion.
in
other
words,
it's
suggesting
the
argument
of
finality
which
i've
just
--
been
suggesting
myself
to.
and
there
is
also
just
saying
in
effect
which
i
want
to
come
to
in
a
second,
but
anyway
there
wasn't
any
prejudice.
and
then
the
state
in
his
brief
says,
what
the
state
--
the
court
in
oregon
did
was
to
balance
these
two,
and
say,
we
ought
to
have
finality
and
it
really
wasn't
very
much
prejudice,
so
it's
all
okay.
and
i'm
just
taking
the
two
points
made
by
the
state
in
his
brief
and
analyzing
separately.
now
as
they
say,
the
finality
argument
i
think
this
without
a
merit.
and
the
state
as
i
have
said
goes
on
to
say,
“well,
anyway
there
wasn't
any
prejudice.
there
wasn't
any
prejudice
here
to
this
defendant”.
and
there
are
three
things
wrong
with
that
argument.
the
first
is
as
i've
said
the
hearing
court
found
as
in
fact
there
was
prejudice.
and
the
second
thing
wrong
with
it
is,
there
is
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
making
it
perfectly
clear
we
submit
that
in
circumstances
such
as
this,
it
isn't
necessary
for
a
defendant
to
assume
the
burden
of
proving
actual
prejudice.
this
court's
decision
starting
with
tumey
versus
ohio
running
through
turner
and
louisiana
including
irvin
v.
dowd,
estes,
sheppard;
all
those
cases
established
the
proposition
that
where
the
circumstances
are
as
here
so
inherently
prejudicial.
it
isn't
necessary
in
order
to
establish
a
constitutional
right
that
the
defendant
assumed
the
burden
of
proving
actual
prejudice.
and
finally
on
this
argument
of
prejudice,
i
would
say
simply
that
the
state's
argument
proves
too
much.
it
would
have
us
prove
that
mr.
parker
was
prejudiced.
where
the
only
way
left
to
prove
it
would
be
to
have
a
juror
come
in
and
say,
”yes,
i
was
in
fact
influenced
by
what
that
bailiff
told
me
about
his
guilt”.
well,
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
testimony
of
course
that
almost
everybody
agrees.
the
rules
of
--
uniform
rules
of
evidence
and
everybody
else
agrees.
that
kind
of
evidence
is
not
admissible.
so
that
for
those
reasons,
i
don't
plan
to
talk
any
longer
unless
there
are
questions,
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
the
state's
arguments
are
without
any
merit.
and
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
that's
what
the
state
tries
to
suggest
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
a
very
general
rule
and
it's
not
the
rule
of
oregon
because
state
versus
gardner
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
as
i
was
saying
a
moment
ago,
state
versus
gardner
makes
the
pretty
uniform
distinction
as
to
the
kinds
of
proof
that
are
admissible
and
those
that
are
not,
it's
our
saying.
proof
from
a
juror
as
mental
processes,
he
can't
come
into
a
court
and
say,
“gee,
i
read
and
understand
the
court's
instructions
and
if
i
had
i
would
have
voted
the
other
way”.
that's
pretty
universally
condemned.
but
it's
universally
held,
i
believe
that
a
juror
can
come
into
a
court
and
say,
“we
were
offered
bribes",
or
"people
said
things
to
us",
or
any
of
those
other
facts,
overt
facts,
overt
acts,
proof
of
overt
acts
which
can
be
proved
or
disproved
to
testimonial
process.
testimonial
process,
i
should
say.
those
kinds
of
facts
are
admissible
and
that's
the
rule
of
the
state
of
oregon
as
i've
stated
in
the
state
versus
gardner.
and
that's
a
rule
that
mr.
justice
brennan
as
i
said
wrote
a
decision
which
nicely
summarizes
the
history
of
this
problem
in
the
cases
in
--
when
he
was
on
the
jersey
court.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
and
that's
the
standard
rule.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
--
my
--
our
claim
is
your
honor
that
where
the
circumstances
are
so
likely
to
cause
prejudice,
that
it's
not
necessary
to
prove
actual
prejudice.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
testimony
of
the
hearing
--
post-conviction
hearing
mr.
justice
white
was
a
little
confused
and
there
were
three
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
there
were
two
or
three.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no
more
than
that.
no.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes.
well,
two
or
three
regulars
probably
heard
it
and
one
alternate.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
mr.
justice
white.
the
testimony
was
--
there
was
no
finding
made
out
of
it
but
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
we
don't
know
that.
they
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no.
no,
there's
was
not.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
two
things
if
i
might
say
that
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
first
is
your
assumption
of
fact
is
not
quite
correct
on
the
record
but
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
sorry.
i
understood
you
were
addressing
yourself
to
the
record.
and
the
second
thing
as
i
would
say
that
kind
of
evidence,
yes
i
was
affected,
no
i
wasn't
affected.
that's
inadmissible.
i
believe
in
every
jurisdiction,
if
you
--
inadmissible
under
the
uniform
rules
of
evidence
and
perhaps
the
reason
is
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
so
that
a
juror
may
not
be
allowed
to
impeach
his
own
verdict
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
because
a
juror
really
is
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
--
the
turner
rule
to
my
mind
means
that
you
assume
prejudice
because
these
facts
occurred.
now,
i'm
asking
you
here
to
apply
the
turner
rule
to
assume
prejudice
because
three
jurors
heard
an
officer
of
the
state
say,
“this
man
was
guilty”.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
right.
that's
right
your
honor.
because
who
want
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
assume
he
was
not?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
assume
he
was?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that
he
was
present?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
prejudiced.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
right.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
hear
him
say
whether
he
was
prejudice
or
not.
i
think
for
one
thing
no
juror
can
adequately
say.
who
--
what
--
one
of
us
can
say,
what
influences
us
and
what
doesn't.
and
isn't
a
natural
tendency
to
say,
i'm
not
influenced
by
things
i
hear.
i've
got
my
own
mouth
--
mind
and
i
can
make
it
up
myself.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
they're
tended
to.
as
i
understand
oregon
law
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
that
was
unanimous
verdict,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
sorry,
unanimous
verdict.
and
i
should
--
what
i
wanted
to
say
a
minute
ago
mr.
justice
white
was
that
one
of
these
jurors
wasn't
able
to
say
one
way
or
the
other,
whether
she
had
been
prejudiced
by
what
she
heard.
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
page

--
excuse
me.
excuse
me.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
if
i
read
--
it
--
let
me
say
this.
if
it
is
the
oregon
rule
that
you
cannot
prove
this
kind
of
conduct
for
one
reason
or
another
then
it
seems
to
me
that
rule
is
unconstitutional,
if
it
forecloses
the
kind
of
proof
and
the
judicial
action
necessary
to
taking
thereon
as
it
indicated
by
this
case?
if
the
oregon
law
is,
that
this
petitioner
cannot
prove
that
a
state
officer
went
in
and
told
three
jurors
that
he
was
guilty
during
the
course
of
the
trial
then
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--
that
rule
is
applied
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well
mr.
justice
brennan,
no
one
--
as
i
said
nobody
in
this
case
ever
said
that
this
juror's
testimony
wasn't
admissible.
it
wasn't
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i
didn't
understand.
i
only
have
a
fair
reading
of
the
decision
indicates
that
and
i
must
say
that
state
versus
gardner
which
comes
subsequent
to
the
ausplund
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
think
it
is
really
on
all
fours
from
your
decision
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
state
versus
(inaudible)
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
and
that
indicates
i
think
without
any
doubt
whatever
that
the
oregon
rule
is
that
this
kind
of
evidence
is
admissible
through
jurors
or
otherwise.
and
however
you
read
ausplund;
i
think
it
--
if
it
says
that
it's
overruled
by
gardner.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
oregon
court
in
this
case
is
saying,
"we've
got
adequate
state
grounds
on
which
to
foreclose,
on
which
--
upon
which
we
can
foreclose".
and
otherwise
a
valid
constitutional
claim.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
would
just
say
in
response
to
your
honor,
chief
justice
to
the
last
question
on
page
204
of
the
record.
there
appears
a
statement
by
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
that
it
is
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
its
decision
that
the
petitioner
did
raise
the
issue
of
misconduct
as
soon
as
it
could
--
as
soon
as
he
could.
