mr.
david
h.
blunt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
listening
to
the
counsel's
statement
of
facts,
i
believe
it'd
be
helpful
with
the
court
to
have
--
give
it
a
little
more
background
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
parker
was
tried
about
eight
years
ago
on
the
charge
of
first
degree
murder
and
the
jury
came
back
with
a
verdict
of
second
degree.
now,
this
was
appealed,
reversed.
second
trial
was
held
in
1961.
the
trial
began
on
monday
april
24th,
1961.
it
recessed
for
the
weekend
on
saturday
and
sunday
and
it
came
back
the
following
week.
and
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
on
may
3rd,
1961
which
was
a
wednesday.
now,
the
second
trial
was
before
a
different
judge,
a
different
bailiff,
and
of
course
a
different
jury.
now,
he
was
convicted
the
second
time
of
second
degree
murder.
he
moved
for
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
a
failure
of
the
prosecution
who
approved
the
venue
in
the
county.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
and
sentenced
mr.
parker
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
oregon
state
penitentiary.
he
appealed
again
and
the
basis
of
the
appeal
was
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
bring
in
a
new
trial
on
the
failure
to
approve
venue
again.
and
also
a
--
an
objection
to
an
opening
statement
of
district
attorney
alluding
to
a
tape
recording
which
are
not
later
allowed
in
evidence.
now,
this
time
the
oregon
supreme
court
affirmed
the
conviction
on
october
8th,
1963.
now
at
that
time,
mr.
parker
and
his
wife,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
petitioner
mr.
parker
embarked
upon
a
campaign
to
get
another
trial.
mr.
parker
wrote
letters
to
the
jurors.
he
had
his
wife
contact
the
jurors
on
the
jury
list
and
from
the
first
juror
call
found
the
names
of
other
jurors
that
were
holdouts
in
this
26-hour
deliberation.
now,
mr.
parker
prepared
a
tape
recording.
he
had
his
wife
invite
three
of
these
jurors
over
to
her
home.
in
fact,
she
invited
everybody
over
to
her
home
but
only
three
of
them
came
to
the
home
to
listen
to
this
tape
recording.
they
had
a
discussion
of
the
matter
and
went
down
to
see
an
attorney
that
was
hred
by
the
petitioner's
wife
and
talk
it
over
with
him.
he
prepared
the
affidavits
and
on
that
basis
he
submitted
a
post-conviction
petition
under
the
oregon
post-conviction
hearing
act
in
which
they
alleged
a
wide
variety
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
jurors,
the
other
jurors.
they
said
some
of
them
were
sleeping.
he
said,
the
jury
room
door
was
left
open
and
the
jurors
could
hear
conversations
in
the
hallway.
they
said
that
the
remarks
were
made.
now,
the
post-conviction
hearing
had
all
the
jurors
testified
including
the
bailiffs
and
the
two
alternate
jurors.
now
the
--
and
there're
still
a
little
confusion
here
as
to
whether
three
jurors
heard
these
two
remarks,
there
were
two
remarks,
one
was,
“oh,
that
wicked
fellow,
he
is
surely
guilty”.
the
other
one
was,
“if
there's
anything
wrong
with
your
decision
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
will
correct
it”.
now
as
to
the
remark
by
the
bailiff
that
the
petitioner
was
guilty,
this
was
made
to
the
alternate
juror,
a
woman,
and
was
overheard
by
a
regular
juror
from
the
record
indicates
that
she
was
the
longest
holdout.
the
other
remark
was
supposedly
made
to
a
man
juror
with
all
the
men
on
the
jury
testified
post-conviction,
they
didn't
hear
the
other
remark.
this
remark
supposedly
was
overheard
by
another
woman
juror
and
the
other
woman
juror
who
had
been
the
principal
holdout.
now
the
remarks
were
made
during
a
walk
that
the
jurors
took
on
a
sunday.
they
were
out
getting
some
fresh
air
and
the
woman
alternate
juror
expressed
concern
that
the
petitioner's
case,
mr.
parker
is
being
rerouted.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
that
the
petitioner
was
being
rerouted
that
the
--
there
was
a
feeling,
general
feeling
amongst
the
jurors
that
the
--
they're
finding
him
guilty
and
the
state
had
not
proved
this
case
at
least
in
her
own
mind
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
the
post-conviction
hearing
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
remarks
have
been
made.
we
don't
question
this.
this
is
a
finding
of
fact.
supposedly,
the
most
damaging
remark
is
to
the
effect
that
the
petitioner
is
guilty.
now,
the
post-conviction
trial
court
found
also
that
if
these
remarks
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
he
would
on
his
own
motion
have
allowed
a
new
trial.
they
would
have
ordered
a
new
trial.
petitioner
would
not
have
had
even
make
a
motion
to
this
effect.
this
is
the
law
of
oregon,
there's
no
question
of
that.
on
--
if
it's
brought
up
timely
or
even
on
direct
appeal
why
this
would
--
would
grant
the
man
relief.
but
this
is
something
that
happened
two
and
a
half
years
later.
he
--
mr.
parker
chose
to
wait
until
he
lost
his
second
appeal.
then
he
goes
back
and
tried
by
this
route
to
get
a
third
trial.
now,
the
post-conviction
hearing
act
in
oregon
requires
a
higher
standard
than
the
case
law
regarding
motions
for
new
trial
that
requires
a
substantial
denial
of
constitutional
right.
there
are
reasons
for
this.
counsel
calls
it
finality
perhaps
that's
the
best
word
we
can
find
this
time.
he
states
in
his
argument
that
in
this
turner
versus
louisiana
is
not
a
stronger
case
as
mr.
parker
has
here.
well,
we
take
exception
to
this
as
mr.
justice
potter
pointed
out
the
two
bailiffs
in
that
cases
were
also
the
principal
prosecution
witnesses.
and
they
were
with
the
jurors
for
over
three
days
in
that
case
and
the
--
this
court
rightfully
held
that
in
a
situation
like
that
you
don't
have
to
show
prejudices.
no
question
to
that.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
no,
your
honor.
i'm
speaking
in
terms
into
the
litigation.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
that's
correct
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
questions
but
that
it
would
have
gotten
a
new
trial
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
the
general
case
law
is
that
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
we
have
a
statute
so
your
honor
that
forbids
this
type
of
convict
expressly.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
i'm
not
quite
sure
mr.
justice
fortas
as
to
whether
it
would
be
purely
constitutional
or
purely
statutory
or
perhaps
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
yes,
your
honor.
however,
the
--
it's
my
opinion
your
honor
that
a
prejudice
or
substantial
denial
is
a
relative
thing.
certainly,
many
things
that
affect
interstate
commerce
without
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
yes,
your
honor.
on
collateral
facts,
where
you
hold
a
higher
standard,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
your
honor,
the
--
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
this
one
juror
that
was
a
holdout
went
to
the
trial
judge
after
the
trial
was
over
and
she
was
conscience
stricken
as
i
understand
this
happens
frequently
in
this
type
of
a
trial
after
a
juror
go
back
and
talk
to
the
judge
and
say,
“i
don't
know
if
i
did
the
right
thing
or
not
in
giving
up
--
giving
in
to
the
majority
here”.
she
had
at
that
time
an
opportunity
to
tell
the
judge
of
these
remarks.
if
in
fact
she
had
been
very
much
impressed
by
these
things
but
she
didn't
do
it.
she
didn't
think
about
these
things
for
two
and
a
half
years
later
at
the
insistence
of
the
petitioner
here
and
his
wife.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
he
could
have
moved
for
a
new
trial
your
honor
any
time
up
to
the
time
the
decision
affirming
his
conviction
has
been
rendered
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
your
honor
that
does
post
a
problem
here
then
--
these
were
the
--
this
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
the
balancing
of
the
two
doctrines
must
be
made.
counsel
has
it
--
ruled
it
sort
of
a
balance,
he
spoke
off.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
the
equities
as
giving
finality
to
a
verdict
as
against
the
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
state
is
saying
here
is
that
he
can
raise
it
up
to
a
certain
time.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
i
would
say
they
would
probably
rely,
your
honor
at
the
--
up
to
the
time
the
decision
affirming
his
conviction
has
been
handed
down.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
no,
your
honor.
it
does
not.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
it
is
not
clear
on
that
exact
point
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
that
if
any
case
spells
it
out.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
this
pure
conjecture
of
my
parts
your
honor
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
no.
no
in
fairness
your
honor,
i
can't
say
that.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
not
directly,
your
honor.
only
through
the
record
itself
in
this
respect
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
as
such.
i
believe
all
the
points
have
been
covered.
thank
you.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
listening
to
the
counsel's
statement
of
facts,
i
believe
it'd
be
helpful
with
the
court
to
have
--
give
it
a
little
more
background
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
parker
was
tried
about
eight
years
ago
on
the
charge
of
first
degree
murder
and
the
jury
came
back
with
a
verdict
of
second
degree.
now,
this
was
appealed,
reversed.
second
trial
was
held
in
1961.
the
trial
began
on
monday
april
24th,
1961.
it
recessed
for
the
weekend
on
saturday
and
sunday
and
it
came
back
the
following
week.
and
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
on
may
3rd,
1961
which
was
a
wednesday.
now,
the
second
trial
was
before
a
different
judge,
a
different
bailiff,
and
of
course
a
different
jury.
now,
he
was
convicted
the
second
time
of
second
degree
murder.
he
moved
for
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
a
failure
of
the
prosecution
who
approved
the
venue
in
the
county.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
and
sentenced
mr.
parker
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
oregon
state
penitentiary.
he
appealed
again
and
the
basis
of
the
appeal
was
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
bring
in
a
new
trial
on
the
failure
to
approve
venue
again.
and
also
a
--
an
objection
to
an
opening
statement
of
district
attorney
alluding
to
a
tape
recording
which
are
not
later
allowed
in
evidence.
now,
this
time
the
oregon
supreme
court
affirmed
the
conviction
on
october
8th,
1963.
now
at
that
time,
mr.
parker
and
his
wife,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
petitioner
mr.
parker
embarked
upon
a
campaign
to
get
another
trial.
mr.
parker
wrote
letters
to
the
jurors.
he
had
his
wife
contact
the
jurors
on
the
jury
list
and
from
the
first
juror
call
found
the
names
of
other
jurors
that
were
holdouts
in
this
26-hour
deliberation.
now,
mr.
parker
prepared
a
tape
recording.
he
had
his
wife
invite
three
of
these
jurors
over
to
her
home.
in
fact,
she
invited
everybody
over
to
her
home
but
only
three
of
them
came
to
the
home
to
listen
to
this
tape
recording.
they
had
a
discussion
of
the
matter
and
went
down
to
see
an
attorney
that
was
hred
by
the
petitioner's
wife
and
talk
it
over
with
him.
he
prepared
the
affidavits
and
on
that
basis
he
submitted
a
post-conviction
petition
under
the
oregon
post-conviction
hearing
act
in
which
they
alleged
a
wide
variety
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
jurors,
the
other
jurors.
they
said
some
of
them
were
sleeping.
he
said,
the
jury
room
door
was
left
open
and
the
jurors
could
hear
conversations
in
the
hallway.
they
said
that
the
remarks
were
made.
now,
the
post-conviction
hearing
had
all
the
jurors
testified
including
the
bailiffs
and
the
two
alternate
jurors.
now
the
--
and
there're
still
a
little
confusion
here
as
to
whether
three
jurors
heard
these
two
remarks,
there
were
two
remarks,
one
was,
“oh,
that
wicked
fellow,
he
is
surely
guilty”.
the
other
one
was,
“if
there's
anything
wrong
with
your
decision
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
will
correct
it”.
now
as
to
the
remark
by
the
bailiff
that
the
petitioner
was
guilty,
this
was
made
to
the
alternate
juror,
a
woman,
and
was
overheard
by
a
regular
juror
from
the
record
indicates
that
she
was
the
longest
holdout.
the
other
remark
was
supposedly
made
to
a
man
juror
with
all
the
men
on
the
jury
testified
post-conviction,
they
didn't
hear
the
other
remark.
this
remark
supposedly
was
overheard
by
another
woman
juror
and
the
other
woman
juror
who
had
been
the
principal
holdout.
now
the
remarks
were
made
during
a
walk
that
the
jurors
took
on
a
sunday.
they
were
out
getting
some
fresh
air
and
the
woman
alternate
juror
expressed
concern
that
the
petitioner's
case,
mr.
parker
is
being
rerouted.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
that
the
petitioner
was
being
rerouted
that
the
--
there
was
a
feeling,
general
feeling
amongst
the
jurors
that
the
--
they're
finding
him
guilty
and
the
state
had
not
proved
this
case
at
least
in
her
own
mind
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
the
post-conviction
hearing
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
remarks
have
been
made.
we
don't
question
this.
this
is
a
finding
of
fact.
supposedly,
the
most
damaging
remark
is
to
the
effect
that
the
petitioner
is
guilty.
now,
the
post-conviction
trial
court
found
also
that
if
these
remarks
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
he
would
on
his
own
motion
have
allowed
a
new
trial.
they
would
have
ordered
a
new
trial.
petitioner
would
not
have
had
even
make
a
motion
to
this
effect.
this
is
the
law
of
oregon,
there's
no
question
of
that.
on
--
if
it's
brought
up
timely
or
even
on
direct
appeal
why
this
would
--
would
grant
the
man
relief.
but
this
is
something
that
happened
two
and
a
half
years
later.
he
--
mr.
parker
chose
to
wait
until
he
lost
his
second
appeal.
then
he
goes
back
and
tried
by
this
route
to
get
a
third
trial.
now,
the
post-conviction
hearing
act
in
oregon
requires
a
higher
standard
than
the
case
law
regarding
motions
for
new
trial
that
requires
a
substantial
denial
of
constitutional
right.
there
are
reasons
for
this.
counsel
calls
it
finality
perhaps
that's
the
best
word
we
can
find
this
time.
he
states
in
his
argument
that
in
this
turner
versus
louisiana
is
not
a
stronger
case
as
mr.
parker
has
here.
well,
we
take
exception
to
this
as
mr.
justice
potter
pointed
out
the
two
bailiffs
in
that
cases
were
also
the
principal
prosecution
witnesses.
and
they
were
with
the
jurors
for
over
three
days
in
that
case
and
the
--
this
court
rightfully
held
that
in
a
situation
like
that
you
don't
have
to
show
prejudices.
no
question
to
that.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
no,
your
honor.
i'm
speaking
in
terms
into
the
litigation.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
that's
correct
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
questions
but
that
it
would
have
gotten
a
new
trial
and
(voice

--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
the
general
case
law
is
that
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
we
have
a
statute
so
your
honor
that
forbids
this
type
of
convict
expressly.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
i'm
not
quite
sure
mr.
justice
fortas
as
to
whether
it
would
be
purely
constitutional
or
purely
statutory
or
perhaps
(voice

--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
yes,
your
honor.
however,
the
--
it's
my
opinion
your
honor
that
a
prejudice
or
substantial
denial
is
a
relative
thing.
certainly,
many
things
that
affect
interstate
commerce
without
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
yes,
your
honor.
on
collateral
facts,
where
you
hold
a
higher
standard,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
your
honor,
the
--
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
this
one
juror
that
was
a
holdout
went
to
the
trial
judge
after
the
trial
was
over
and
she
was
conscience
stricken
as
i
understand
this
happens
frequently
in
this
type
of
a
trial
after
a
juror
go
back
and
talk
to
the
judge
and
say,
“i
don't
know
if
i
did
the
right
thing
or
not
in
giving
up
--
giving
in
to
the
majority
here”.
she
had
at
that
time
an
opportunity
to
tell
the
judge
of
these
remarks.
if
in
fact
she
had
been
very
much
impressed
by
these
things
but
she
didn't
do
it.
she
didn't
think
about
these
things
for
two
and
a
half
years
later
at
the
insistence
of
the
petitioner
here
and
his
wife.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
he
could
have
moved
for
a
new
trial
your
honor
any
time
up
to
the
time
the
decision
affirming
his
conviction
has
been
rendered
(voice

--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
your
honor
that
does
post
a
problem
here
then
--
these
were
the
--
this
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
the
balancing
of
the
two
doctrines
must
be
made.
counsel
has
it
--
ruled
it
sort
of
a
balance,
he
spoke
off.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
the
equities
as
giving
finality
to
a
verdict
as
against
the
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
state
is
saying
here
is
that
he
can
raise
it
up
to
a
certain
time.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
well,
i
would
say
they
would
probably
rely,
your
honor
at
the
--
up
to
the
time
the
decision
affirming
his
conviction
has
been
handed
down.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
no,
your
honor.
it
does
not.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
it
is
not
clear
on
that
exact
point
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
that
if
any
case
spells
it
out.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
this
pure
conjecture
of
my
parts
your
honor
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
no.
no
in
fairness
your
honor,
i
can't
say
that.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
not
directly,
your
honor.
only
through
the
record
itself
in
this
respect
--
mr.
david
h.
blunt
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
blunt
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
as
such.
i
believe
all
the
points
have
been
covered.
thank
you.
