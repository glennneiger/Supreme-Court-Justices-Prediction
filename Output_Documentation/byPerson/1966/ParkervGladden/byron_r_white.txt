what's
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
claim
that
this
conduct
without
any
showing
prejudice
must
be
assumed
to
have
affected
the
jurors?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
claim
for
a
moment
that
anybody
--
anyone
but
the
two
jurors
heard
it
or
heard
these
alleged
statements,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
three
--
two
or
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
two
or
three
but
no
more
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
one
of
them
was
an
alternate?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
a
minute
--
i
thought
it
was
just
the
most
of
these
two
all
--
two
regulars
and
one
alternate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
anyway,
the
same
people
who
heard
it
were
the
ones
who
gave
--
who've
impeached
this
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
there's
no
allegation
what
so
--
they're
the
ones
who
were
unhappy
with
the
verdict
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
suggestion
in
their
statements
or
affidavits
that
they
themselves
were
affected.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
their
testimony,
their
affidavits
were
available,
and
there
may
have
been
some
--
maybe
some
presumption
or
some
inference
like
in
turner
or
something
that
when
you
got
something
like
this
you
don't
really
go
much
further.
and
when
the
people
who
raised
it
and
the
only
people
who
raised
it,
the
only
people
who
read
it
or
heard
it
say,
"this
was
a
bad
thing
and
don't
go
on
and
say,
it
was
so
bad
that
i
was
affected".
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
--
the
ordinary
rule
would've
apply,
let's
assume
one
juror
comes
in
and
says,
“here's
what
the
bailiff
told
me”.
then
you
asked
the
juror
that,
“did
it
affect
you?”
he
says,
“i
should
stay
not.
i
held
out
to
the
bitter
end”.
and
what
--
are
you
--
then
are
you
supposed
to
reverse?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
--
i
asked
you
a
hypothetical.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
which
way
is
--
so
that
you
can
apply
the
turner
rule
or
so
that
you
shouldn't
apply
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
you
don't
apply
the
turner
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
apply
the
turner
rule
because
the
juror
who
brings
it
up
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
say,
what's
the
fact
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
assume
he
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was.
you
assume
he
was
a
juror.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
prejudice,
that's
what
your
argument.
we
must
assume
that
he
was
prejudice.
justice
byron
r.
white
prejudiced.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
always
available
to
say
one
way
or
another
whether
he
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
these
are
--
are
they
--
you
own
unanimous
verdicts
in
oregon?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
particular
two
jurors
who
heard
it
voted
against
the
conviction.
justice
byron
r.

what
was
