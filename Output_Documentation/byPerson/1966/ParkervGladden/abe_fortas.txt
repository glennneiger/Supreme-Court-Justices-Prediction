justice
abe
fortas
i'm
a
--
excuse
me
sir.
but
quite
--
i
don't
understand
something
here.
so
i
understand
that
the
post-conviction
trial
court
held
that
a
--
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
a
new
trial
in
regards
that
these
statements
had
been
made
and
that
they
were
prejudicial.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
the
trial
court
--
post-conviction
trial
court
had
not
correctly
applied
the
post-conviction
standards.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
would
be
the
basis
for
setting
aside
the
verdict
for
granting
a
new
trial
if
the
same
situation
had
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
before
sentence?
justice
abe
fortas
on
what
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
what's
the
legal
concept?
it's
a
denial
of
the
fair
trial,
isn't
it?
that
is
even
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
i
say
he
would've
gotten
a
--
are
you
saying
that
it's
purely
statutory
and
not
constitutional?
or
isn't
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
my
point
is
that
i
turn
to
see
the
--
how
--
to
raising
a
question
as
to
whether
there
is
really
a
difference
between
the
rule
that
would
apply
in
the
course
of
the
trial
before
a
sentence.
on
the
one
hand
on
the
post-conviction
rule,
in
your
brief
on
page
3
you
said
that
the
oregon
statute
and
subsection
(a)
of
the
post-conviction
statute
allows
relief
to
be
granted
when
there's
a
substantial
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
a
substantial
denial
of
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial
means
one
thing
post-conviction
and
another
thing
while
the
trial
is
still
in
process?
