we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
texas
v.
new
mexico.
mr.
caroom,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren

i
am
curious.
do
you
think
the
master's
statement
in
his
report
was
directed
at
the
negotiators
or
at
counsel
or
respective
governors
or
to
whom
was
it
addressed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
his
position
is
in
the
middle
are
you
prepared
to
take
from
that
he
is
now
recommending
what
he
had
hoped
or
thought
the
parties
should
have
agreed
to
in
a
compromise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
caroom.
mr.
simms,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
caroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
the
special
master
was
aware
of
these
factors.
perhaps
he
didn't
give
them
the
significance
you
think
they
deserved.
but
he
was
aware
of
all
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
