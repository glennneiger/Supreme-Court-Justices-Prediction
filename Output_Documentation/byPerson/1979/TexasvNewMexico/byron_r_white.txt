justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
never
adopted
it
either,
have
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
actual
conditions?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
would
still
hold
true
if
it
turned
out
that
there
was
a
printing
error
in
the
engineering
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
that
even
if
everybody
conceded
the
report
just
made
an
outright,
obvious
mistake
in
describing
what
the
condition
on
the
river
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
neither
has
the
special
master,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
work
either
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
somebody
has
to
be
able
to
understand
the
report
and
he
says
the
report
is
full
of
mistakes,
uncertainties
and
omissions,
by
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
also
indicated
that
none
of
the
engineers--
well,
some
of
the
engineers
didn't,
too,
apparently.
they
certainly
disagreed
with
each
other
mightily.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
just
ask
another
point
of
inquiry.
on
this
rather
elaborate
chart
which
i
guess
we
are
talking
about
exhibit
8
of
the
master's
report
there
are
figures
for
each
year
from
1905
through
1946.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
in
making
the
calculations
say
for
1905
or
1906
they
assumed
that
the
cedars
would
have
been
those
that
were
in
effect
1947
and
then
extrapolated
back
to
what
the
river
flow
would
have
been
had
that
condition
existed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
did
that
for
everything
that
was
present
in
1947,
they
computed
back
to
a
hypothetical
set
of
facts
for
the
earlier
years
and
then
did
the
arithmetic
on
what
they
thought
the
water
would
have
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
those
were
different
alternatives
that
they
studied
before
they
agreed
upon
using
1947
as
the
base
point,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
this,
under
the
master's
understanding
of
the
proper
definition
of
1947
condition
what
function
will
this
chart
play?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
is
texas'
--
but
i
am
saying
that
under
the
master's
definition
what
function
will
this
chart
perform?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
just
a
total
useless
exercise
under
his
definition?
justice
byron
r.
white
general
simms,
i
understand
that
--
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
had
the
true
facts
been
known
and
been
reflected
on
the
chart
here
the
net
effect
would
have
been
favorable
to
new
mexico
rather
than
texas,
which
i
guess
is
the
burden
of
what
you
are
saying,
if
they
had
not
made
mistakes
in
some
of
their
estimates
and
projections
and
so
forth.
but
how
does
that
meet
the
argument
that
the
purpose
of
the
chart
was
to
define
a
point
of
reference
which
is
specifically
referred
to
in
the
compact?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why,
for
example,
did
they
extrapolate
as
to
what
they
thought
the
conditions
were
in
1905
and
1906,
thought
those
conditions
would
have
been
if
the
physical
developments
that
were
in
place
in
1947
had
been
in
place
earlier.
why
did
they
do
that?
why
didn't
they
just
leave
it
open
and
say
let's
figure
these
things
out
as
we
go
along.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
correct
that
this
exhibit
8
of
the
master's
report
is
a
part
of
the
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committee?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
i
want
to
know
what
your
view
of
the
significance
of
the
second
sentence
in
the
article
is
and
i
don't
find
the
master
as
satisfactorily
explaining
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
next
sentence.
"in
determining
any
question
of
fact
hereafter
arising
as
to
such
situation
reference
shall
be
made
to
and
decision
shall
be
based
on
such
report."
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
he
is
not
doing
that,
is
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
'47
condition
referred
to
a
certain
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it
is
december
31
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
'47?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
took
the
view
that
it
is
an
artificial
condition
as
defined
in
the
report,
the
date
really
is
immaterial.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
sorry.
i
say
if
one
took
your
opponent's
view
that
the
condition
is
that
defined
by
the
report
and
the
exhibits,
then
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
the
date
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
by
the
way
is
the
only
matter
attached
to
the
master's
report
that
has
any
1947
data
in
it.
the
routing
study
doesn't
have
any
'47
data
in
it,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
the
master
says
that
none
of
the
river
routing
studies
presented
to
the
compact
negotiators
covered
1947
data.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
primarily
why
he
chose
the
first
of
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
