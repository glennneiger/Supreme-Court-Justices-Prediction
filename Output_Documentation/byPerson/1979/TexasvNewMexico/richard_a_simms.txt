mr.
richard
a.
simms
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
respond
quickly
to
your
concern,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
try
to
explain
to
you
just
what
that
41-column
routing
study
is
and
its
relation
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
1947
condition
is
real
or
artificial.
that
question
appears
as
item
no.
4-a
in
the
master's
pre-trial
order
of
october
31,
1977.
under
item
4-b
of
that
pre-trial
order
there
were
11
additional
issues
that
were
raised,
each
of
which
related
to
whether
or
not
the
original
1947
condition
study
as
it
appears
in
appendix
a
in
the
special
master's
report
should
have
been
corrected
factually
and
engineeringly.
the
first
one
of
those
issues
related
to
the
use
by
the
pecos
river
commission
in
its
restudy
of
the
condition
in
the
'fifties
of
revised
usgs
stream
flow
records.
the
stream
flow
data
that
was
originally
available
did
not
change
but
the
usgs
had
determined
that
it
was
improperly
reported.
the
accuracy
of
the
revised
data
was
not
disputed
by
the
parties.
well,
the
errors
in
the
original
study
show
up
most
conspicuously
in
appendix
a
in
columns
1,
column
13,
column
25
and
column
35.
those
are
the
columns
which
were
designed
to
describe,
in
effect,
the
rainfall
and
the
snow
melt.
to
give
you
an
example
of
the
magnitude
of
the
difficulty,
new
mexico's
exhibit
no.
37
before
the
master
shows
that
54
percent
of
the
monthly
calculations
in
column
1
in
the
original
study
were
significantly
in
error.
well,
the
net
effect
of
that
was
to
mathematically
put
more
water
in
the
river
into
state
line
than
would
have
gotten
there
under
the
1947
condition
for
each
of
the
historic
years
that
they
attempted
to
route
water
down
the
river
through
that
condition.
and
that
condition
is
all
of
the
reservoirs
on
the
stream,
three
major
reservoirs,
the
channel
losses
between
the
reservoirs,
all
of
the
diversion
works
and
the
irrigation
depletions
that
actually
existed
in
the
basin
in
'47.
another
of
those
4-b
issues
that
are
still
back
before
the
master
relates
to
column
12
in
the
routing
study
in
appendix
a.
that
is
artesian
inflow
and
that
relates
to
that
part
of
the
study
that
attempted
to
describe
channel
gains
and
losses
between
alamogordo
reservoir
to
the
north
and
mcmillan
reservoir
to
the
south,
while
the
pecos
river
commission
determined
that
the
original
study
put
about
9,600
acre-feet
per
year
too
much
into
the
river
resulting
in
a
corresponding
state
line
exaggeration
of
new
mexico's
delivery
obligation
of
approximately
4,800
acre-feet.
in
other
words,
if
the
agreement
embodies
in
the
compact
is
the
real
1947
condition
as
opposed
to
its
first
attempted
description
the
use
of
the
erroneous
description
would
administratively
add
about
4,800
acre-feet
annually
to
new
mexico's
obligation.
another
of
those
4-b
issues
relates
to
column
10
in
appendix
a
and
that
relates
to
channel
loss
between
alamogordo
reservoir
to
the
north
and
a
gage
called
acme.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that
is
correct.
the
pecos
river
commission
in
its
study
in
the
'fifties
determined
that
the
original
appendix
a
study
showed
that
the
losses
were
about
16,500
acre-feet
per
year
too
small.
well,
that
had
the
corresponding
effect
of
inflating
new
mexico's
obligation
under
the
compact.
if
you
look
to
column
16,
that
relates
to
salt
cedar
depletion
in
a
delta
area
above
mcmillan
reservoir.
there
the
pecos
river
commission
and
the
engineer
advisors
to
the
commission
determined
that
the
original
study
understated
the
depletion
by
23,900
acre-feet
a
year.
just
above
that
on
the
exhibit
--
stipulated
exhibit
no.
2
is
column
14.
that
relates
to
farmers
pumping
water
out
of
the
river.
there
the
pecos
river
commission
and
the
engineer
advisors
determined
that
the
original
study
--
in
the
original
study
the
wrong
acreage
was
used
and
also
the
wrong
depletion
rate
was
used.
that
had
the
mathematical
effect
of
deflating
column
14
by
about
6,500
acre-feet
a
year
and
inflating
column
41
at
the
state
line
by
a
corresponding
amount.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
purpose
of
the
routing
study
was
twofold.
it
serves
one
purpose
in
the
administration
of
the
compact.
there
it
becomes
the
backbone
of
what
is
called
the
inflow-outflow
technique.
in
the
negotiation
period
what
they
did
was
finally
decide
to
freeze
conditions
in
new
mexico
as
of
1947.
that
is
all
thoroughly
explained
by
royce
tipton.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
they
did
it
first
of
all
because
all
of
the
engineer
advisors
thought
it
would
be
unwise
to
predicate
this
compact
on
what
is
called
a
schedule,
that
is,
you
know,
so
much
water
coming
in
up
here
that
means
that
so
much
water
has
got
to
go
out
here.
you
simply
right
that
down
and
you
enter
an
agreement.
the
hydrology
of
the
river
is
too
complicated
largely
because
of
all
of
the
phreatophytes
on
the
river
and
the
difficulty
they
were
having
there,
which
we
will
discuss
in
a
moment.
what
they
did
was
use
the
condition
as
a
way
of
freezing
development
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
then
they
ran
that
condition
of
frozen
development
through
year
historically
between
1905
through
1946
when
they
ran
out
of
data
at
the
time
and
attempted
to
assess
by
doing
that
how
the
river
would
have
behaved
historically
given
the
existence
of
the
'47
condition.
it
was
that
real
live
condition
on
the
stream
that
they
wanted
to
look
at
and
they
wanted
to
get
some
idea
of
how
the
river
would
behave
in
future
years.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that
is
correct.
but
importantly
though
the
nature
of
the
agreement
was
not
the
first
routing
study
that
described
it
but
rather
the
condition
that
described
the
frozen
conditions
as
of
1947.
royce
tipton
was
the
engineering
advisor
to
the
federal
representative
during
the
negotiations.
that
is
precisely
the
way
in
which
he
explained
the
final
compromise
in
the
litigation.
what
the
pecos
river
did
though,
it
started
out
and
had
difficulty
trying
to
make
the
compact
work,
in
effect.
there
was
a
large
difficulty
with
what
is
called
the
inflow-outflow
manual
which
is
an
administrative
tool
used
to
engineeringly
arrive
at
inflows
for
administrative
years
and
then
to
come
back
and
plug
them
into
a
curve
that
was
created
as
a
result
of
the
41-column
study.
before
we
take
the
exhibit
out
let
me
point
out
one
area
on
the
map
and
that
is
between
roswell
and
artesia.
you
will
notice
there
an
area
shaded
in
green.
that
area
is
supported
by
groundwater
pumping
that
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
second
half
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
problem
of
base
flow
diminution
and
the
difficulties
with
water
salvage.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
is.
and
i
was
going
to
go
straight
to
your
question
about
article
2-g.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
second
sentence
reads,
i
believe,
the
term
1947
condition
means
that
situation
in
the
pecos
river
basin
as
described
in
the
report
to
the
engineering
advisory
committee.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no.
he
is,
precisely.
texas
is
not
doing
it.
what
texas
does
is
to
look
at
the
report
and
then
say
examination
of
the
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committees
shows
that
the
1947
condition
is
just
the
name
of
that
routing
study.
that
is
not
true.
article
2-g
defines
the
report.
it
is
much
more
than
that
routing
study.
indeed,
the
first
statement
in
the
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committee
about
the
1947
condition
is,
and
i
am
quoting
"the
1947
condition
is
all
actual
present
conditions
on
the
river."
that
statement
was
made
on
january
14,
1948.
article
2-f
defines
the
breadth
of
the
report.
it
is
much
more
than
appendix
a.
it
says
"the
1948
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committee
includes
that
report,
the
appendices
thereto,
the
basic
data
and
processes
and
analyses
used
in
preparing
it,
all
of
which
were
reviewed,
adopted
and
approved
as
shown
in
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
of
december
3,
1948."
there
royce
tipton
explained
this
compact
to
the
negotiators
and
to
the
commissioners.
each
provision
of
the
pecos
river
compact
was
explicitly
adopted
subject
to
his
explanation.
in
explaining
article
2-g
he
said
the
1947
condition
relates
to
a
condition
on
the
stream.
there
were
certain
conditions
of
the
river
such
as
the
diversionary
requirements
of
the
carlabad
project,
the
salt
cedar
consumption,
the
reservoir
capacities
that
existed
in
1947,
the
operation
of
the
fort
summer
project
up
to
6,500
acres
and
the
operation
of
all
other
projects
on
the
stream
as
they
actually
existed
in
1947.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
clearer
statement
that
the
1947
condition
as
envisaged
by
the
engineer
advisors
and
the
commissioners
who
finally
signed
the
compact
was
indeed
the
reality
on
the
stream.
perhaps
the
most
compelling
bit
of
evidence
that
should
persuade
the
court
that
new
mexico's
view
of
the
1947
condition
and
the
master's
view
of
the
1947
condition
is
correct
is
the
fact
that
the
pecos
river
commissioners,
all
of
the
engineer
advisors
involved
in
the
negotiation
of
the
compact
themselves
sought
to
correct
that
description
before
they
personally
believed
that
they
should
do
any
administration
under
the
compact.
i
would
point
out
that
the
people
that
corrected
it,
the
deadwood
is
called
the
review
of
basic
data
and
ended
up
with
what
is
shown
as
appendix
b
in
the
master's
report
a
second
description
of
the
1947
condition.
those
were
the
same
actors
working
on
the
commission
--
working
for
the
peciso
river
commission
in
the
'fifties
as
were
there
negotiating
and
adopting
the
compact
in
1949.
well,
the
legal
side
of
this
question
relates
to
the
power
of
the
pecos
river
commission
to
make
the
corrections
it
actually
made.
we
feel
that
that
is
answered
clearly
and
conclusively
by
article
6-c
of
the
compact
and
that
reads
"unless
and
until
a
more
feasible
method
is
devised
and
adopted
by
the
commission
the
inflow-outflow
method
as
described
in
the
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committee
shall
be
used
to
determine
the
effect
on
the
state
line
flow
of
any
change
in
depletion
by
man's
activities
or
otherwise."
when
mr.
tipton
talked
of
that
article
he
said
the
way
the
pecos
compact
is
written
the
commission
has
full
authority
to
change
the
method
or
perfect
the
technique
so
long
as
what
is
done
by
the
commission
is
something
directed
at
the
determination
under
article
3-a.
to
avoid
or
to
obviate
the
significance
of
article
6-c,
what
texas
tries
to
do
is
draw
a
distinction
between
the
routing
study
as
it
is
used
administratively
in
the
compact
and
what
is
called
the
inflow-outflow
technique
of
administration.
well,
you
can't
do
that.
the
only
utility
of
that
routing
study
in
the
actual
administration
of
the
compact
is
to
construct
an
inflow-outflow
plate,
a
plate
that
you
can
--
in
administrative
years
you
go
out
on
the
river,
you
gather
up
inflow
data
for
three
years
running,
you
go
back
to
this
plate
and
plug
into
the
inflow
side
of
the
plate
and
you
come
out
with
an
indicated
outflow
that
should
define
new
mexico's
obligation.
well,
the
routing
study
for
administrative
purposes
is
as
integral
a
part
of
the
technique
as
is
the
gathering
of
data
during
administrative
years.
indeed,
it
is
the
very
backbone
of
the
inflow-outflow
method.
well,
if
you
throw
out
the
inflow-outflow
method
as
the
commission
is
expressly
authorized
to
do
by
article
6-c
you
throw
out
the
whole
inflow-outflow
manual.
you
also
throw
out
plate
2
and
you
also
throw
out
the
routing
study,
at
least
for
administrative
purposes.
what
you
are
left
with
is
the
1947
condition
on
the
stream
which
is
precisely
the
same
condition
that
the
engineering
advisors
tried
to
better
ascertain
by
attempting
to
correct
the
engineering
input
into
the
inflow-outflow
method
instead
of
totally
abandoning
the
method
and
starting
off
with
something
else.
this
answer
that
i
am
giving
you
is
precisely
the
same
answer
that
the
attorney
general
of
texas
gave
to
the
texas
water
rights
commission
in
1969.
the
cooperative
work
of
the
pecos
river
commission
was
sought
to
be
repudiated
unilaterally
by
the
texas
river
commissioner
not
until
1974.
but
to
start
his
efforts
he
requested
that
the
texas
water
rights
commission
put
this
very
question
to
the
attorney
general
of
texas.
he
answered
it
in
precisely
the
same
way
i
just
answered
it
for
the
court.
the
legal
advisors
to
the
pecos
--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
yes,
it
is.
it
appears
--
it
is
texas
attorney
general
m-535,
it
is
dated
december
5,
1969.
i
would
refer
you
to
pages
2547
to
2551
of
that.
texas
also
tries
to
rely
on
article
6-a.
there
article
6-a
reads
"the
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committee
supplemented
by
additional
data
hereafter
accumulated
shall
be
used
in
making
administrative
determinations.
well,
texas
emphasizes
the
phrase
"in
making
administrative
determinations."
if
you
look
at
the
simple
grammar
of
that
article
what
is
supplemented
is
the
original
report,
not
the
data,
that
is
picked
up
and
gathered
during
the
administrative
period.
that
also
comports
with
mr.
tipton's
explanation
that
the
pecos
river
commission,
and
i
am
quoting
him,
"as
time
goes
on
may
more
nearly
perfect
the
curves
which
appear
in
the
engineering
advisory
committee
report.
well,
the
administrative
history
we
think
is
clear.
texas
tries
to
distinguish
somehow
between
what
happened
before
1957
and
what
happened
after
1957.
we
don't
think
that
distinction
is
tenable
and
there
the
record
will
not
support
it.
we
would
refer
you
to
pages
11
through
26
of
our
reply
brief
and
20
through
41
of
the
brief
in
support
of
our
objections.
also
to
agree
with
texas'
objection
in
this
regard
would
be
to
condone
the
attempted
unilateral
repudiation
of
bilateral
compact
action.
i
believe
this
court
has
consistently
though
it
has
only
had
a
couple
of
occasions
on
which
to
do
it,
but
it
has
consistently
voided
any
unilateral
state
action
designed
to
define
obligations
under
compact.
in
dyer
v.
simms
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
tried
to
relieve
west
virginia
of
its
obligations
under
a
multi-state
compact.
here
no
coordinate
branch
of
the
texas
state
government
tried
to
do
it;
the
texas
pecos
commissioner
tried
to
do
it
himself.
he
never
made
a
motion
before
the
commission
and
certainly
no
effort
was
made
to
revoke
the
compact
pursuant
to
article
14
of
its
terms
by
seeking
the
state's
revocation
of
their
ratification.
texas
has
argued
we
believe
wrongly
on
the
law
that
well,
both
states
are
simply
stuck
for
the
study.
i
would
point
out
another
error
in
the
inflow-outflow
manual
that
if
we
were
stuck
with,
as
the
master
has
ruled,
that
needs
to
be
corrected
as
well.
if
we
were
stuck
with
that,
it
would
by
texas'
own
analysis
cost
them
42,000
acre-feet
per
year.
i
think
the
answer
to
the
fact
that
we
aren't
stuck
with
the
study
derives
simply
from
the
fact
that
the
1947
condition
is
not
what
you
see
in
appendix
a.
well,
the
other
half
of
this
case
relates
to
base
flow
diminution
and
the
problem
of
water
salvage.
and
i
think
that
is
really
why
we
are
here.
we
aren't
here
because
there
has
been
a
bunch
of
gluttonous
development
in
new
mexico
since
1947,
we
aren't
here
because
of
changes
in
depletions
in
new
mexico
since
1947.
we
are
here
because
of
the
failure
to
offset
anticipated
declines
in
the
flow
of
the
river
by
water
salvage.
toward
the
end
of
compact
negotiations
the
engineer
advisors
advised
the
commissioners
of
two
facts,
essentially,
that
in
the
mcmillan
delta
above
that
reservoir
was
a
huge
floodway
of
phreatophytes,
phreatophytes
that
were
non-beneficially
consuming
about
39,000
acre-feet
of
water
each
year.
they
knew
that
there
was
some
likelihood
of
salvaging
water
from
that
ratification.
on
the
other
hand,
they
knew
that
the
pumping
in
the
area
that
i
showed
you
on
the
map,
the
area
between
roswell
and
artesia,
if
continued
at
the
depletion
rate
of
1947
would
ultimately
decrease
the
base
flow
of
the
river
just
below
there
approximately
40,000
acre-feet
a
year.
well,
what
they
attempted
to
do
was
come
up
with
a
mechanism,
a
remedial
mechanism
to
keep
the
river
whole
over
time.
well,
the
real
reason
we
are
here
today
is
because
there
has
not
been
effected
any
water
salvage,
and
that
is
the
problem.
the
whole
scheme
was
to
make
it
so
that
according
to
article
1
of
the
compact
we
could
maintain
the
uses
not
just
in
new
mexico
but
in
both
states.
our
objection
to
the
master's
report
in
this
regard
goes
to
his
failure,
in
our
view,
to
really
appreciate
the
issue.
he
did
not
weigh
in
the
balance
the
water
salvage
provisions
on
the
one
hand
and
the
base
flow
diminution
problem
on
the
other
hand.
in
response
to
our
objections
before
him
in
that
regard
he
said
that
salvage
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
1947
condition.
well,
quite
the
contrary,
article
3-a
says
that
new
mexico
shall
not
deplete
the
flow
of
the
pecos
river
at
the
state
line
below
an
amount
which
will
give
to
texas
a
quantity
of
water
equivalent
to
that
available
under
the
1947
condition.
now,
it
is
that
concept
of
equivalence
that
facilitates
the
substitution
of
source
of
supply
in
new
mexico
as
base
flow
declines
with
water
salvaged.
the
intent
again
was
to
keep
the
river
whole
over
time
and
the
compact,
as
i
say,
is
essentially
remedial
in
nature.
the
question
of
what
happens
when
salvage
is
not
effected
to
offset
that
base
flow
diminution
is
not
addressed
by
the
compact.
there
is
testimony
on
it
by
john
erickson.
he
was
asked
the
question
of
what
happened
and
he
said,
"i
don't
think
they
ever
considered
it.
if
the
compact
worked
as
anticipated,
you
wouldn't
get
to
the
problem."
well,
all
you
can
do
is
look
to
the
salvage
provisions
of
the
compact.
they
mandate
in
article
4
cooperative
salvage.
when
mr.
tipton
explained
the
compact
he
said
that
the
compact
by
its
terms
mandates
salvage
in
order
to
make
it
work.
also
i
would
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
the
new
mexico
legislature
would
not
have
ratified
the
compact
if
that
burden
is
not
shared.
the
alternative
would
have
been
an
immediate
and
very
drastic
outback
in
irrigated
acreage
in
new
mexico.
while
texas
has
referred
to
our
construction
of
the
compact
as
ludicrous
in
saying
that
it
removes
salvage
from
the
realm
of
possibility,
well,
that
was
precisely
the
design
of
the
compact
over
time,
40
years
from
when
the
compact
was
ratified,
that
is
exactly
what
they
contemplated,
they
would
have
salvaged
enough
water
from
eradicating
phreatophytes
to
offset
the
base
flow
diminution.
and
from
that
point
on
everybody
would
have
lived
happily
ever
after.
well,
the
consequences
unfortunately
are
that
both
states
are
suffering.
texas
is
not
bearing
this
burden
alone.
there
has
been
a
drastic
water
shortage
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
continues
to
be.
shortage
is
a
fact
that
crosses
the
state
line
and
i
think
obviously
transcends
the
sovereignty
that
generated
this
litigation.
finally,
there
is
one
other
matter
in
issue,
one
other
matter
to
which
we
objected,
and
that
is
the
master's
conclusion
that
the
1947
condition
though
albeit
reality
should
have
ended
december
31,
1946.
well,
he
reached
that
as
a
supposition.
he
said
because
in
the
original
study
they
only
used
the
period
1905
to
1946
the
engineers
must
have
intended
to
exclude
the
year
1947.
well,
in
this
regard
we
would
like
to
rely
on
our
briefs
but
i
do
want
to
respond
very
quickly
to
six
items
in
texas'
reply
brief.
first,
texas
argues
that
phrases
like
"in
1947"
and
"during
1947"
were
simply
loose
references
or
convenient
shorthand.
well,
they
are
very
anomalous
loose
references
and
convenient
shorthand.
on
the
contrary,
if
they
wanted
a
1946
condition
they
would
have
so
named
it.
texas
also
states
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
fact
that
the
1946
photographs
that
we
talked
about
were
interpolated
against
1946
photographs
to
better
ascertain
the
1947
condition.
texas
argues
aside
from
the
accusation
that
they
were
really
after
salt
cedar
acreage
and
salt
cedar
acreage
alone.
well,
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
the
photographs
to
which
we
referred
you
will
find
in
stipulated
exhibit
no.
4
and
the
fact
that
they
were
interpolating
to
determine
irrigation
in
1947
as
well
as
salt
cedar
acreage
you
will
find
in
stipulated
exhibit
no.
6
both
of
them.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
did
not
refer
to
a
certain
day
but
the
engineer
advisors
and
the
commission
itself
in
doing
the
review
of
basic
data
used
all
of
the
'47
condition
--
or
i
mean
all
of
the
1947
data
that
actually
became
available
when
they
did
the
final
review
--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that
is
right.
they
used
data
--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
not
through
the
water
year.
well,
they
themselves
used
data
in
the
calendar
year
1947.
that
has
to
tell
you
that
1947
was
indeed
a
part
of
the
1947
condition.
if
you
will
look
--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
hear
the
question.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
then
all
the
errors,
the
erroneous
description
and
everything
else
as
it
were
is
the
compact.
the
parties
to
the
compact
themselves
however
did
not
have
that
view,
as
their
actions
we
think
unequivocally
demonstrate.
texas
also
says
that
in
plates
5
through
10
in
the
inflow-outflow
manual
the
inclusion
of
1947
data
was
insignificant.
well,
those
plates
were
reach
by
reach
inflow-outflow
routing
studies
to
determine
the
1947
condition.
they
did
indeed
include
the
year
1947
in
those
individual
curves.
if
they
did
not
want
the
year
1947
to
be
a
part
of
the
base
line
curve
against
which
you
would
later
make
administrative
determinations
there
is
no
reason
why
you
would
have
included
that
data
except
to
conclude
that
the
year
'47
is
a
part
of
it.
also
in
the
review
of
basic
data
itself
undertaken
over
a
number
of
years
texas
simply
says
the
review
of
basic
data
on
this
point
is
dubious.
well,
it
is
not
dubious
at
all.
it
shows
the
contemporaneous
understanding
of
the
parties.
they
are
the
sane
actors
involved
in
all
of
this,
the
entire
review
was
orchestrated
by
royce
tipton
who
was
an
internationally
famous
hydrologist
and
the
advisor
to
the
federal
representative
on
this
commission.
texas
makes
a
fifth
point
saying
that
well,
the
first
administrative
years,
the
first
administrative
determinations
were
done
through
the
three-year
period
1947
to
1949.
well,
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
the
pecos
river
commission
later
determined
that
they
should
not
have
done
that.
one
final
point,
your
honors,
new
mexico
tendered
evidence
on
this
subject
and
the
master
concluded
that
that
evidence
was
speculative.
our
witness
was
john
erickson.
new
mexico's
advisor,
engineering
advisor
to
the
negotiating
commission.
he
said
the
simple
reason
they
didn't
use
it
then
was
because
they
didn't
have
it.
if
they
did
have
it
they
would
have
used
it.
we
would
suggest
quite
the
contrary,
that
it
was
the
master's
supposition
that
it
was
speculative
and
not
at
all
with
john
erickson
whose
testimony
the
master
described
as
speculative.
thank
you.
