mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
original
action
initiated
by
the
state
of
texas
over
six
years
ago
to
enforce
the
pecos
river
compact,
an
interstate
agreement
concerning
the
distribution
of
water
on
the
pecos
river.
for
the
last
four
years
we
have
been
before
the
special
master,
the
honorable
jean
s.
preitenstein.
during
this
time
the
master
has
issued
two
reports.
the
first
report
was
in
july
1977,
his
report
on
new
mexico's
affirmative
defenses
to
our
action.
in
that
report
he
overruled
the
affirmative
defenses
of
lack
of
justiciable
controversy,
exhaustion,
primary
jurisdiction,
estoppel
and
laches.
new
mexico
has
voiced
no
objection
to
that
ruling.
the
master
has
filed
another
report,
his
--
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
you
have
not
adopted
it.
it
was
filed,
i
believe
is
the
notation
given.
new
mexico
has
not
in
this
most
recent
round
of
objections
objected
to
the
original
report,
either.
the
current
report
is
the
master's
determination
of
new
mexico's
obligation
under
article
3-a
of
the
pecos
river
compact.
this
is
the
key
provision
and
let
me
briefly
read
it
to
the
court.
it
states
"new
mexico
shall
not
deplete
by
man's
activities
the
flow
of
the
pecos
river
at
the
new
mexico-texas
state
line
below
an
amount
which
will
give
texas
a
quantity
of
water
equivalent
to
that
available
under
the
1947
condition."
now,
the
key
phrase
here
is
"the
1947
condition"
which
is
defined
by
article
2-g
of
the
compact.
article
2-g
states
"the
1947
condition
means
that
situation
in
the
pecos
river
basin
as
described
and
defined
in
the
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committee."
it
goes
on
to
say
"in
determining
any
question
of
fact
hereafter
arising
as
to
such
situation
reference
shall
be
made
to
and
decision
shall
be
based
on
such
report.
"now,
the
engineering
advisory
report
is
a
collection
of
various
reports
put
together
by
a
committee
of
engineers
that
were
advising
the
compact
negotiators
prior
to
the
adoption
and
ratification
of
the
compact.
texas
contends
the
two
compact
provisions
i
have
read
to
you
must
be
and
were
intended
to
be
applied
literally,
i.e.
the
1947
condition
is
exactly
what
the
compact
says,
it
is
that
condition
defined
in
the
engineering
report.
new
mexico
would
go
a
step
further
and
extrapolate
the
definition.
new
mexico
would
say
that
because
the
engineering
reports
were
intended
to
reflect
conditions
existing
on
the
river
roughly
in
1947,
that
the
1947
condition
is
not
as
defined
by
the
compact,
it
is
not
that
engineering
report
but
rather
those
conditions
which
the
report
was
depicting.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
new
mexico
would
say
that
the
1947
condition
is
not
the
report
and
the
conditions
it
is
describing
but
rather
those
conditions
it
was
intending
to
describe.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
right.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
that
would
be
the
strict
literal
consequence
of
our
case.
we
don't
want
to
be
unreasonable
about
it.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
but
the
problem
here
is
--
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
i
as
a
lawyer
would
say
that.
our
compact
commissioners
have
not
said
that.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
that
is
true.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
in
evaluating
the
state's
argument
--
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
this
is
where
the
master
is
suggesting
the
compact
won't
work
because
the
states
are
both
fairly
hard
headed.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
i
don't
agree
with
the
master's
statement
that
the
compact
appears
to
be
unworkable
or
with
his
concern.
the
states
have
basically
been
separated
over
the
years
by
their
different
constructions
of
the
term
1947
condition.
because
of
this
it
was
impossible
for
either
of
the
states
to
really
compromise
their
position
and
give
away
water
they
thought
they
were
entitled
to.
i
think
once
this
is
all
resolved
that
we
will
be
able
to
make
the
compact
work.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
if
this
is
resolved
in
new
mexico's
favor,
all
texas
has
to
do
is
attend
the
meetings
once
a
year.
we
can
make
that
work.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
it
is
directed,
i
believe,
at
the
pecos
river
commission,
the
representatives
from
each
state.
it
is
directed
also,
i
think,
perhaps
at
the
lawyers
in
the
case.
if
you
look
at
the
master's
july
1977
report
that
was
accepted
by
this
court,
he
initially
tried
to
reach
a
compromise
and
essentially
told
the
state
"i
am
going
to
withhold
rulings
on
three
of
these
affirmative
defenses
until
you
all
have
gone
back
to
the
pecos
river
commission
and
tried
to
work
this
out,
and
i
am
giving
you
18
months
to
do
that.
now,
shortly
after
his
report
came
out
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
pecos
river
commission
and
the
state
had
an
opportunity
to
file
objections
to
that
report.
we
filed
the
objections
and
he
coincidentally
received
a
copy
of
the
transcript
of
that
meeting.
the
combination
of
the
transcript
of
the
meeting
and
the
objections
filed
convinced
the
master
that
it
would
serve
no
purpose
to
remand
the
states
and
give
them
this
opportunity
to
work
it
out.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
yes,
and
the
master
is
in
the
middle.
his
decision
so
far
as
the
theory
of
what
the
1947
condition
is
goes
with
new
mexico.
it
says
it
is
now
what
the
engineering
report
says
but
rather
the
conditions
the
engineers
were
trying
to
depict
what
was
on
the
river.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
i
would
hesitate
to
speculate
what
the
master
thought
we
should
agree
to
in
a
compromise.
he
was
simply
telling
us
to
go
compromise.
i
think
the
master
has
now
presented
us
with
what
he
thinks
is
a
fair
compromise.
what
he
has
done
is
taken
new
mexico's
theoretical
view
to
the
'47
condition
question
but
given
them
less
than
everything
they
were
asking
for.
he
says
if
it
is
going
to
be
natural
conditions
on
the
river
we
have
to
have
a
date
to
see
when
those
actual
conditions
cut
off.
and
that
date
is
january
1,
1947.
the
master
also
says
--
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
so
far
as
i
know
we
have
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
reflect
that.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
new
mexico
certainly
thinks
it
makes
a
difference,
your
honor.
the
second
point
that
the
master
did
not
go
with
new
mexico
on
is
the
question
of
groundwater
depletion.
this
is
a
little
bit
more
complex.
the
pecos
river
is
not
simply
a
surface
water
system.
there
are
groundwater
aquifers
near
the
river
which
feed
the
river
and
in
times
past
have
significantly
contributed
to
the
flow
of
the
river.
in
1947
new
mexico
irrigators
were
over-pumping
the
groundwater
system.
they
were
drawing
water
out
faster
than
it
would
recharge.
consequently
if
that
1947
pumping
continues
you
have
a
continued
decline
of
the
groundwater
aquifer
and
a
continued
decrease
of
the
groundwater
contribution
to
the
river,
based
upon
the
pumping
existing
in
1947.
the
master's
ruling
said
you
did
not
get
the
ultimate
effect
of
the
1947
pumping
in
terms
of
the
depletion.
all
you
get
is
the
depletion
which
was
reflected
in
the
river
january
1,
1947.
so
new
mexico's
is
contesting
those
two
points.
we
are
contesting
the
master's
basic
decision.
now,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
what
the
master
was
doing
was
trying
to
reach
an
equitable
compromise
for
a
difficult
problem.
i
think
also
that
in
where
the
master
made
his
mistake.
the
master's
job
in
this
case
was
not
to
work
equity.
the
master's
job
in
this
case
was
to
enforce
the
compact.
equity
had
been
worked,
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
water
had
been
reached
by
virtue
of
the
compact
negotiation
process
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
recommended
for
that
purpose.
his
decision
to
essentially
divide
the
baby
again
after
the
compact
had
fairly
well
pinned
the
1947
condition
to
that
engineering
report.
the
master
is
essentially
encouraging
upstream
states
involved
in
interstate
compacts
now
to
come
in
and
try
for
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
if
it
is
working
a
hardship
upon
them.
let
me
turn
for
just
a
moment
to
the
basis
for
the
master's
decision,
the
basis
he
advances
in
his
report.
he
says
that
he
is
convinced
that
the
1947
condition
refers
to
a
tangible
reality
as
opposed
to
a
bunch
of
numbers.
now,
the
master
has
incorrectly
characterized
texas'
position
insofar
as
he
ties
it
to
the
one
page
of
numbers
appended
to
his
report.
the
routing
study
is
considerably
more
than
that
and
i
have
addressed
that
in
our
brief.
i
believe
when
the
compact
was
drafted
the
negotiators
had
a
very
definite
and
obvious
intent
to
eliminate
the
problem
of
what
was
the
1947
condition
and
what
was
going
on
in
the
river
in
1947.
they
added
the
second
sentence
to
the
definition
which
says
in
solving
any
question
of
fact
pertaining
to
the
1947
condition
you
look
to
the
engineering
report
and
the
decision
is
made
based
upon
that.
there
is
only
one
other
definition
in
the
compact
that
has
a
second
sentence
to
it
like
that
and
that
is
article
2-e
which
defines
deplete
by
man's
activities.
it
states
a
definition
of
depletion
by
man's
activities
which
essentially
makes
it
the
same
thing
as
beneficial
consumptive
use.
it
then
has
a
second
sentence
which
states
for
purposes
of
this
compact
it
does
not
include
diminution
of
flow
by
encroachment
of
salt
cedars
or
other
like
group
or
by
a
deterioration
of
the
channel
of
the
stream.
now,
texas
in
good
faith
could
not
argue
that
man's
activities
included
channel
deterioration.
because
of
the
way
a
reservoir
was
operated,
although
physically
it
is
possible
to
make
a
connection
in
terms
of
causation
this
article
clearly
prohibits
us
from
making
such
an
argument.
similarly,
in
terms
of
the
spread
of
salt
cedars
man's
activities
can't
encroach
that
but
we
could
not
begin
to
advance
that
argument.
yet
article
2-g's
second
sentence
makes
it
equally
clear
that
the
1947
condition
is
to
be
tied
to
that
engineering
report
available
to
the
compact
negotiators
upon
which
the
compact
was
based.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
the
master
has
not
responded
to
the
second
sentence
of
article
2-g.
new
mexico
has
not
responded
to
the
second
sentence
of
article
2-g.
i
have
heard
no
satisfactory
response
to
that.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
he
also
says
in
his
report
that
he
didn't
understand
the
engineering
involved
in
this
and
that
he
was
trying
to
make
--
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
there
were
serious
disagreements
between
the
engineers
about
the
report.
what
the
evidence
reflects
basically
--
let
me
back
up
for
just
a
second.
the
master
was
faced
with
essentially
this
question,
the
legal
interpretation
of
the
1947
condition
when
he
made
his
report
on
affirmative
defenses.
we
urged
him
to
answer
it
at
that
time.
he
said
he
did
not
want
to
decide
the
case
in
a
factual
vacuum,
he
wanted
to
hear
all
about
the
engineering
questions
involved.
so
we
have
over
3,000
pages
of
transcripts
by
engineers'
highly
technical
testimony,
walking
through
the
routing
study
of
senate
document
109
step
by
step,
walking
through
a
substitute
routing
study
that
was
later
done
by
the
commission
called
the
review
of
basic
data
study
step
by
step.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
those
are.
it
is
important
to
realize
these
exhibits
are
simply
summary
documents
which
reflect
the
routing
study
that
was
done.
they
are
not
the
routing
study
themselves.
now,
the
master
does
not
make
that
clear
in
his
report.
this
is
simply
the
summary.
i
have
tried
to
explain
in
my
brief
on
a
step
by
step
basis
what
a
routing
study
is
and
how
it
works.
there
is
more
to
it
than
simply
the
annual
summary.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
oh,
not
that
year;
no.
let
me
back
up
and
make
this
clear.
what
happened
in
the
compact
negotiations
was
the
engineering
committee
performed
a
number
of
routing
studies
such
as
the
one
you
are
looking
at
now
or
each
resulted
in
summaries
like
that.
what
a
routing
study
is
is
essentially
taking
the
natural
conditions
on
the
river,
the
virgin
flow
before
there
is
any
development.
and
by
"development,"
i
mean
irrigation,
reservoirs,
uses
of
the
water.
now,
using
that
virgin
condition
is
a
simplistic
model
the
engineers
would
then
superimpose
upon
it
stages
of
development
of
uses
on
the
river.
so
they
would
impose
the
reservoirs
that
existed
in
1947,
they
would
the
irrigation
projects
that
were
being
irrigated
in
1947,
and
so
forth.
and
then
for
each
year
they
ran
the
water
down
the
river,
adding
and
subtracting
for
each
of
these
gains
and
losses
on
the
river.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
under
the
1947
condition
they
took
the
salt
cedar
growth
which
was
existing
roughly
in
1947
and
imposed
that
on
the
river
for
the
historic
period.
so
that
the
routing
study
shows
looking
at
the
historic
period
how
much
water
would
have
come
down
the
river
each
year
had
those
conditions
been
existing.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
no,
the
salt
cedars
grew
tremendously
in
the
late
'thirties
and
the
'forties.
but
in
the
routing
study
it
shows
them
existing
back
to
1905
and
how
much
water
would
have
come
down
the
river
in
1905
with
them
there.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
all
of
the
1947
conditions
that
are
imposed
upon
the
river
in
the
routing
study
are
assumed
to
remain
constant.
they
vary
according
to
weather,
how
much
rainfall
there
was
that
year,
how
much
water
is
available.
but
those
are
the
conditions
imposed
in
this
engineering
study
upon
the
river.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
the
master
is
quite
right
when
he
says
that.
i
mean
it
is
not
a
precise
description
of
what
existed
in
1947.
it
was
not
intended
to
be.
it
was
intended
to
show
the
major
developments
and
uses
that
were
existing
at
the
time.
and
it
was
thought
to
accurately
depict
the
performance
of
the
river
with
things
actually
on
it
in
1947.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
they
did
that,
precisely.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
they
compared
a
number
of
different
conditions.
the
compared
for
example
1905
conditions.
they
compared
1915
to
1939
conditions.
they
took
different
stages
of
development
on
the
pecos
river
and
tried
to
see
what
water
was
available
under
each
of
those.
one
of
the
conditions
they
did
was
called
the
1947-a
condition
which
was
based
upon
an
offer
of
compact
made
by
new
mexico
which
showed
the
groundwater
contribution
to
the
river
entirely
depleted.
that
was
another
routing
study.
there
was
another
routing
study
which
showed
the
groundwater
entirely
depleted
and
the
salt
cedars
entirely
cleared
out.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
there
are
two
charts.
the
first
one
is
the
1947
condition
routing
which
was
performed
when
the
compact
was
negotiated.
if
texas'
position
is
adopted,
then
this
chart
indirectly
and
the
studies
which
underlie
it
will
form
the
basis
for
a
standard
by
which
new
mexico's
state
line
deliveries
are
judged.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
oh,
excuse
me.
under
the
master's
it
just
gets
thrown
out.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
it
was
entirely
discarded,
as
is
the
rest
of
the
original
engineering
report.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
initially
touch
upon
a
point
mr.
simms
has
recently
made
saying
that
the
players
in
the
review
of
basic
data,
the
people
who
conducted
the
restudy
of
the
1947
condition
routing
study
were
the
negotiators,
the
same
people
who
did
the
compact
and
that
this
has
some
special
significance.
that
is
simply
wrong.
the
players
up
until
1957
were
very
much
the
same.
now,
in
my
brief
i
go
through
the
history
up
to
1957.
but
what
we
have
basically
is
a
document
called
the
inflow-outflow
manual
that
gives
you
directions
for
figuring
out
each
year
whether
or
not
new
mexico
has
complied
with
their
obligation.
that
document
has
some
mistakes
in
it.
it
wasn't
even
drafted
and
available
until
after
the
compact
was
signed.
now,
that
document,
the
inflow-outflow
manual
caused
problems
in
the
early
administration
of
the
compact.
and
the
engineers,
the
same
ones
who
worked
on
the
compact,
participated
in
an
effort
to
review
that
document
and
to
rewrite
it
and
conduct
an
accounting
as
it
should
have
been
done
under
the
original
report.
that
was
done
by
a
subcommittee
of
the
engineers
committee
in
1957.
it
showed
new
mexico
128,000
acre-feet
behind
in
deliveries
and
it
was
turned
down
by
the
engineering
advisory
committee.
now,
it
was
turned
down
because
the
new
mexico
representative
voted
against
it.
the
new
mexico
representative
was
a
state
engineer
who
had
recently
come
in
and
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
negotiation
of
the
compact.
the
subsequent
engineering
study
which
took
place
from
'57
to
'60
was
so
far
as
new
mexico
was
concerned
directed
by
that
same
state
engineer.
the
taxes
engineer
who
had
worked
on
the
original
studies
did
not
participate
in
it
and
in
fact
he
died
mid-way
through
it.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
he
was.
i
think
the
key
to
the
special
master's
treatment
of
the
engineering
report
is
to
his
own
admission
very
forthrightly
in
his
report
that
he
doesn't
understand
this.
he
says
this
is
a
legal
question,
i
am
going
to
rely
on
my
technical
assistant
to
solve
the
engineering
questions.
i
am
treating
this
as
a
legal
question.
but
in
spite
of
that
it
appears
that
a
major
factor
in
the
master's
decision
was
his
perception
that
something
was
wrong
with
the
original
report.
now,
we
had
a
witness,
frank
dowell,
who
was
head
of
usgs
in
the
western
united
states,
or
assistant
head,
who
testified
he
independently
reviewed
it,
it
was
a
good
study,
it
was
workable,
it
was
checked
by
the
engineers
who
did
it
at
the
time
and
it
looked
good.
it
was
independently
checked
by
mr.
bell
subsequently
when
he
was
retained
by
the
state
of
texas
and
he
was
convinced
it
was
a
sound,
workable
study.
the
subsequent
engineering
study
has
more
bells
than
whistles,
it
is
fancier,
the
engineers
think
it
is
a
better
product.
but
it
is
definitely
biased;
it
is
definitely
biased
to
reduce
deliveries
to
new
mexico.
now,
let
me
respond
briefly.
mr.
simms
attempted
to
give
an
explanation
for
the
second
sentence
of
article
2-g.
he
said
the
engineer
advisors
committee
report
includes
more
than
the
routing
study.
now,
this
is
discussed
at
a
little
bit
of
length
in
my
brief
but
the
only
part
of
the
engineer
advisors
report
that
defines
the
1947
condition
is
the
routing
study.
there
is
the
inflow-outflow
manual
that
was
adopted
after
the
compact.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
there
are
two
documents
attached
to
the
master's
report.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
the
first
is
the
summary
of
operations
under
the
original
river
routing
study
by
the
engineers
in
1948.
the
second
document
which
is
attached
to
his
report
is
the
counterpart
of
that
exhibit
which
was
produced
by
the
review
of
basic
data
in
1960
or
'61.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
that
is
correct.
that
data
was
not
available
to
them
when
they
did
it
and
none
of
the
studies
have
any
'46
data
whatsoever.
mr.
douglas
g.
caroom
and
the
condition
was
agreed
upon
without
it.
let
me
make
one
other
brief
point.
mr.
simms
said
this
inflow-outflow
manual
cannot
be
separated
from
the
routing
study
and
he
apparently
sold
judge
breitenstein
on
this
idea.
and
it
is
just
flat
wrong.
the
inflow-outflow
manual
is
an
instruction
manual
that
tells
you
how
to
do
the
annual
computation.
it
tells
you
what
the
steps
are
to
use
the
1947
condition
routing
study
and
compare
the
annual
deliveries
on
the
river
to
see
if
there
has
been
compliance.
the
inflow-outflow
manual
has
errors
in
it,
it
left
out
part
of
the
water
coming
in
below,
the
alamogordo
reservoir
down
to
acme;
it
just
flat
left
out
that
part.
it
was
a
mistake
and
it
made
other
mistakes.
but
the
standard
is
there
in
the
routing
study
without
the
inflow-outflow
manual.
thank
you.
