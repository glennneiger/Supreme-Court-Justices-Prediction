you
say
you
don't
want
to

unreasonable.
i
am
disturbed
about
the
special
master's
statement
on
page
48
of
his
report.
i
quote
"the
intransigent
attitude
of
each
state
over
the
many
years
of
this
controversy
suggests"
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
have
asked
this
except
that
you
said
you
didn't
want
to
be
unreasonable.
unknown
speaker
at
least
new
mexico
thinks
it
makes
a
difference.
