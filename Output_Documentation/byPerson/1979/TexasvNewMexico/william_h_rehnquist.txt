well,
what
is
your
attack
on
the
master's
report,
page
36,
where
he
says
"texas
contends
that
the
1947
condition
is
immutably
expressed
in
the
routing
study.
the
master
disagrees.
that
routing
study
is
no
more
than
a
model
of
how
the
river
would
operate
under
various
assumptions.
it
does
not
describe
or
define
any
situation.
the
compact
recognizes
supplementation
'by
additional
data
hereafter
accumulated.'"
the
master
at
that
portion
of
his
report
essentially
advances
four
reasons
for
rejecting
texas'
position.
the
first,
i
have
addressed
briefly,
that
the
routing
study
does
not
define
or
describe
any
situation.
the
master
at
another
portion
of
his
report
says
it
must
refer
to
a
tangible
reality,
it
can't
be
synthetic
imagery.
i
think
the
second
sentence
of
article
2-g
is
the
clear
answer
to
that,
it
says
it
is
the
report
and
it
is
not
up
to
the
master
now
to
change
it.
now,
the
second
basis
the
master
criticized
--
justice

h.
rehnquist
these
are
the
two
exhibits
attached
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
compact
refers
to
the
1947
condition
you
say
it
incorporates
the
1947
statistics
on
the
routing
study?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
the
average
which
appears
below
the
1947
but
the
1947
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
growths
of
those
salt
cedars?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
had
the
same
number
of
salt
cedars
existed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
number
of
salt
cedars
is
assumed
to
remain
constant
throughout
this
period?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
suggests
to
me
that
the
master
is
quite
right
when
he
says
the
routing
study
--
the
report
doesn't
describe
any
actual
condition.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
alamogordo
is
up
by
fort
sumner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
looking
backward
they
felt
would
give
them
some
added
capacity
to
predict
as
to
the
future
behavior?
