mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
the
extent
to
which
the
government
can
make
evidentiary
use
of
immunized
testimony
in
a
prosecution
for
perjury
committed
in
the
course
of
that
testimony.
respondent
was
called
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
he
testified
--
initially
when
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
he
declined
to
testify,
relying
on
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
the
government
then
sought
and
obtained
an
immunity
order
under
the
federal
immunity
statute
to
compel
his
testimony.
and
he
then
testified,
and
in
the
course
of
his
testimony
he
made
several
false
statements
that
form
the
basis
for
the
perjury
charges
against
him.
now,
after
a
jury
trial,
respondent
was
convicted
on
two
counts
of
perjury.
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
government
introduced
not
only
the
charged
false
statements
themselves,
but
also
other
portions
of
his
immunized
testimony,
to
show
that
those
false
statements
were
in
fact
false
and
that
the
falsehoods
were
made
knowingly,
and
that
the
inquiries
and
the
responses
were
material
to
the
grand
jury's
inquiry.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reserved.
it
held
that
the
only
portions
of
respondent's
grand
jury
testimony
that
could
permissibly
be
used
against
him,
were
those
portions
that
were
specifically
charged
as
false,
what
the
court
called
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
offense.
now
the
court
defined
the
corpus
delicti
as
follows
to
include
the
false
charged
statements
themselves,
plus
those
portions
of
his
grand
jury
testimony
that
were
absolutely
essential
to
convey
the
context
within
which
the
false
statements
were
made.
the
court
held
that
the
use
of
any
other
portions
of
his
grand
jury
testimony,
even
if
relevant
and
material
to
prove
the
charges
against
him,
was
error.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there
are
basically
two
ways
to
approach
the
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
one
is
to
say
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
government
grants
immunity
to
a
witness
and
the
immunity
grant,
which
is
intended
to
confer
a
protection
on
the
witness
in
exchange
for
something
useful
to
the
government
--
if
the
immunity
grant
does
not
insure
to
some
extent
at
least
that
the
government
will
get
truthful
testimony,
that
if
it
doesn't
give
the
government
some
means
of
getting
truthful
testimony,
then
the
immunity
grant
is,
in
effect,
no
grant
at
all.
it
gives
the
government
nothing
in
exchange
for
the
immunity
that
is
given
to
the
witness.
so
it
is
necessary
as
a
matter
of
the
grant
of
immunity
that
the
government
have
some
right
to
protect
itself
against
perjury
in
the
course
of
that
immunized
testimony.
the
other
approach
is
to
say
that,
in
fact,
perjury
is
a
crime
which
has
not
yet
occurred
at
the
time
the
individual
pleads
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
it
is
not
a
crime
as
to
which
he
has
a
privilege
at
the
time
he
invokes
his
privilege,
and
therefore
he
gets
no
protection
under
the
grant
of
immunity.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
except,
your
honor,
that
if
he
had
invoked
his
privilege
--
let's
take
an
example
suppose
that
an
individual
had
committed
a
bank
robbery,
or
was
under
investigation
for
a
bank
robbery
that
had
occurred
10
years
ago,
and
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run.
he
came
before
the
grand
jury,
and
was
questioned
about
the
bank
robbery,
and
he
invoked
his
privilege.
if
he
went
before
a
court,
the
court
would
say,
"you
can't
claim
your
privilege
with
respect
to
the
bank
robbery.
you
have
no
privilege
with
respect
to
that
offense.
why
are
you
claiming
a
privilege?"
he
would
say,
"because
i
may
commit
perjury
in
the
course
of
my
testimony,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
prosecuted
for
it."
the
court
would
say,
"you
don't
have
a
privilege
with
respect
to
that,"
and
therefore
he
would
be
compelled
to
testify.
so
the
language
in
kastigar
that
suggests
that
the
immunity
must
be
as
broad
as
the
privilege
is
consistent
with
our
position
here,
which
is
that
the
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
true,
but
the
question
is,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
immunity
that
he
is
granted,
whether
or
not
the
government
contests
the
scope
or
the
propriety
of
the
claim
of
the
immunity
at
the
time
it
is
granted.
clearly,
from
this
court's
cases,
it
is
established
that
the
immunity
doesn't
protect
against,
for
example,
uses
against
the
witness
in
civil
proceedings,
uses,
specifically
here
for
perjury,
to
show
the
actual
perjured
statements.
it
does
have
its
limits.
it
doesn't
put
the
individual
in
the
same
position
that
he
would
be
in,
if
he
had
simply
remained
silent.
the
question
is
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
the
basic
theoretical
posture
on
which
we
proceed.
if
an
individual
comes
before
a
court
and
says,
"i
may
commit
a
crime
next
week.
if
i
testify
today,
i
may
give
evidence
that
will
be
useful
in
prosecution
of
me
in
connection
with
that
crime,"
then
the
privilege
does
not
protect
that
individual
against
the
future
crime.
and
an
example
of
this
would
be,
suppose
the
individual
were
to
come
before
a
grand
jury
in
an
investigation,
say,
of
his
possession
of
firearms,
and
he
were
to
say
before
the
grand
jury,
"i
intend
to
kill
the
president
next
week."
well,
it
can't
be,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
under
this
court's
decisions,
or
even
as
res
nova,
could
--
would
hold
that
this
individual
would
have
a
privilege
not
to
testify
because
he
believes
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
this
future
crime.
and
by
the
same
token
he
does
not
have
immunity
with
respect
to
any
statements
he
may
make
that
are
used
in
connection
with
a
future
offense,
his
prosecution
for
a
future
offense.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
think,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
the
theoretical
basis
for
both
really
is
found
in
the
second
prong,
but
i
think
we
can
rely
on
both
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
correct.
there
is.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
don't
specifically
rely
on
that
theory,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
because,
well,
because
we
think
that
the
reason
that
perjury
is
really
--
the
reason
that
perjury
is
an
offense
as
to
--
future
perjury
is
an
offense
as
to
which
there
is
no
privilege,
is
because
it
is
a
future
offense,
not
so
much
because
it
is
perjury,
although
we
do
rely
on
the
general
notion
--
which
i
think
is
an
important
notion,
and
it
is
one
that
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
before
--
that
the
grant
of
immunity
has
no
value
if
in
fact
it
confers
with
it
an
immunity
from
prosecution
for
perjury
which
is
committed
in
the
course
of
that
immunized
testimony.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
he
were
granted
immunity,
that
is
correct,
he
would
have
protection
against
the
use
of
his
statements
because
he
had
--
he
is
testifying
with
respect
to
a
former
crime,
just
as
if
he
was
testifying
with
respect
to
a
former
bank
robbery.
he
would
be
protected.
in
this
case,
however,
his
claim
would
have
to
be
that
he
fears
that
he
may
incriminate
himself
with
respect
to
perjury
that
he
may
commit
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
we
are
relying
on
that
as
a
theoretical
basis,
but
i
don't
want
to
abandon
the
very
important
notion
which
underlies
the
first
prong,
which
is
that
the
government
must
be
entitled
in
granting
immunity,
to
protection
against
perjury
in
the
course
of
that
immunity.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
ordinarily
it
is
pretty
clear
what
the
basis
for
the
claim
of
privilege
is;
if
the
witness
is
being
called
in
to
testify
with
respect
to
an
investigation
of
a
bank
robbery,
and
he
takes
the
fifth,
it
is
pretty
clear
that
he
fears
incrimination
with
respect
to
the
bank
robbery
and
possibly
other
related
offenses,
or
related
instances
that
could
lead
to
his
incrimination.
but
the
government,
it
is
our
submission,
does
not
have
to
go
before
the
court
and
make
sure
that
everyone
understands
that
he
can
not
claim
the
privilege
with
respect
to
the
risk
of
future
perjury,
because
in
our
view
that
is
the
rule,
that
he
can't
and
that
he
should
understand
that,
and
that
there
is
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
correct,
unless
he
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
correct,
and
unless
he
had
invoked
--
having
made
his
initial
false
statement
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
unless
he
invoked
his
privilege
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
if
he
did
not,
he
could
be
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
correct,
because
the
false
statement,
the
perjury
there,
would
have
occurred
after
the
initial
grant
of
immunity,
and
as
of
the
time
of
the
initial
grant
of
immunity,
that
statement
would
not
have
been
protected
by
the
privilege.
now
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
question
of
whether
there
can
be
a
prosecution
for
perjury
is
not
in
issue;
the
question
is
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--
how
much.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that
--
there
is
no
question.
as
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
there
is
a
prosecution.
but
i
would
like
to,
in
light
of
that
issue,
i
would
like
to
point
out
just
why
it
is
that
it
is
so
important
that
this
kind
of
evidence
be
admissible.
it
may
not
seem
so
at
first
blush,
but
in
fact,
in
many
perjury
prosecutions
this
is
the
best
evidence,
and
sometimes
the
only
evidence
that
can
be
adduced
to
show
that
the
statements
were
in
fact
perjurious.
now
to
take
an
example,
many
times
perjury
comes
not
in
the
form
of
a
flat
false
statement,
that
is
to
say,
that
"x"
didn't
happen,
but
rather
that
the
witness
will
simply
say,
"i
don't
recall,"
some
event
which,
in
the
view
of
the
government
and
what
we
believe
the
proof
will
show,
he
clearly
must
recall.
the
best
way
to
prove
that,
and
again
often
the
only
way
to
prove
that
that
is
a
false
statement,
that
he
in
fact
does
recall,
is
to
show
what
he
was
saying
in
the
course
of
his
grand
jury
testimony
leading
up
to
that
statement
and
after
that
statement.
for
example,
suppose
the
grand
jury
is
investigating
a
particular
instance
that
occurred
a
year
ago,
and
they
ask
the
witness
a
series
of
questions
about
that
incident;
and
he
remembers
what
he
was
wearing
on
that
day,
what
he
had
for
breakfast,
who
he
was
with,
what
the
weather
was
like,
and
then
he
is
asked
the
critical
question,
"did
you
give
mr.
x
$10,000,"
and
he
says,
"i
don't
recall."
well,
the
fact
that
he
says
at
that
point,
"i
don't
recall,"
is,
in
context
with
those
other
questions,
highly
incredible;
but
if
you
take
that
statement
out
of
context
and
simply
have
the
one
statement
admissible
at
trial,
"i
don't
recall,"
in
response
to
the
question,
"did
you,
six
months
ago
or
a
year
ago,
take
$10,000
from
mr.
x,"
it
is
very
hard
to
prove
that
is
false,
that
in
fact
he
does
recall.
so
it
is,
in
effect
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
absolutely.
that
is
a
risk
which
is,
as
a
general
matter,
too
speculative
and
remote
to
entitled
to
the
protection
or
the
privilege.
now
in
the
case
that
i
put,
if
we
bring
a
prosecution,
of
course,
we
can
practically
not
prove
that
the
statement,
"i
don't
recall"
--
which
in
fact
was
the
statement
that
was
made
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
one
of
the
counts
--
we
are
practically
disabled
from
proving
that
that
was
not
true,
and
in
effect,
this
rule,
for
which
respondent
contends
and
which
the
third
circuit
adopted,
undercuts
the
whole
premise
of
glickstein,
the
supreme
court's
decision
back
in
1911,
in
which
it
held
that
when
the
government
grants
immunity
it
retains
unfettered
power
to
prosecute
the
witness
if
the
witness
abuses
the
grant
of
immunity
by
lying
under
oath.
so
in
effect,
the
third
circuit
and
respondent
have
argued
for
a
partial
immunity
from
perjury.
now,
as
i
say,
it
is
our
position
that
neither
the
federal
immunity
statute
nor
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
the
use
of
all
relevant
portions
of
the
witness's
grand
jury
testimony
to
prove
that
he
committed
perjury
under
the
grant
of
immunity.
and
first
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
fifth
amendment
problem
a
bit.
i
would
like
to
touch
on
the
statutory
point.
the
federal
immunity
statute,
which
both
respondent
and
court
appeals,
although
briefly,
rely
on
to
support
their
position,
the
federal
immunity
statute
provides
that
immunized
testimony
can
be
used,
and
i
quote,
"in
a
prosecution
for
perjury."
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
its
legislation
history
that
suggests
that
that
broad
language
was
intended
to
have
any
narrower,
more
restrictive
meaning.
it
does
not
say,
"in
a
prosecution
for
perjury,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
the
false
statement
constitutes
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
offense,"
or
"only
to
the
extent
that
the
immunized
testimony
is
false."
it
is
a
basic
rule
that
where
there
is
a
prosecution
under
the
grant
of
immunity,
the
immunity
does
not
apply,
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
supports
this.
the
--
again
and
again,
the
legislative
history
reflects
that
congress
intended
the
immunity
statute
to
go
to
the
constitutional
limits,
which
we,
as
we
argue
here,
believe
permit
any
legitimate
use
of
the
immunized
testimony.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
statute
is
not
--
the
three
exceptions
in
the
statute
are
not
the
only
exceptions
to
the
use
of
immunized
testimony,
but
they
are
clearly-stated
exceptions,
so
that
those
exceptions
do
--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
which
we
argued
in
the
dunn
case
last
year
--
that
point
is
not
necessary,
of
course,
to
resolve
this
case
--
but
in
the
dunn
case
that
was
argued
last
year,
we
argued,
and
we
have
made
the
same
argument,
i
think,
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
in
this
case,
that
the
constitutional
limits
is
what
congress
had
in
mind;
that
congress
intended
the
immunity
statute
to
be
read
to
include
anything
that
the
constitution
would
permit.
an
example
where
i
think
that
would
be
necessary,
as
a
construction,
would
be
my
example
of
a
threat
against
the
president.
if
the
witness
goes
in
under
a
grant
of
immunity
and
makes
a
threat
against
the
president
inside
the
grand
jury,
even
though
he
is
testifying
under
a
grant
of
immunity,
we
believe
that
the
federal
immunity
statute
would
permit
his
prosecution
for
threatening
the
president.
and
similarly,
if
he
tried
to
bribe
the
grand
jurists,
to
take
an
example,
but
it
isn't
necessary
to
reach
that
point
in
this
case
because
this
is
