justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bryson,
you
are
assuming,
i
take
it,
that
perjury
is
prosecutable
even
after
immunity
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
matter
of
--
if
the
matter
were
res
nova,
what
would
be
the
basis
for
that
assumption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
take
the
language
from
kastigar
and
from
portash,
that
the
grant
of
immunity
must
be
just
as
broad
as
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
not
a
very
--
that
is
not
very
logical,
if
the
matter
were
res
nova,
because
if
a
man
had
claimed
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
government
never
would
have
been
able
to
ask
him
any
questions,
and
there
never
would
have
been
any
possibility
of
perjury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
assumes
that
the
government
isn't
willing
to
force
the
fifth
amendment
issue
right
at
the
time;
that
rather
than
tell
the
man,
"we
don't
think
you
have
a
fifth
amendment
privilege.
go
before
the
judge
and
have
him
decide
it,"
because
of
some
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
the
early
'50s.
it
is
just
a
much
easier
thing
to
do,
to
give
this
man
immunity
and
convict
some
of
the
higher-ups,
rather
than
fight
it
out
on
the
fifth
amendment
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
scenario
which
you
outlined
a
minute
ago,
seems
to
me
to
be
the
reverse
of
what
usually
happens.
your
scenario
indicates
that
first
immunity
is
granted,
and
then
the
witness
testifies
without
anything
happening
first.
as
i
understand
it,
what
first
happens
is,
the
witness
says
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
prosecutor,
"i
claim
my
privilege
against
self-incrimination,"
and
the
government
says,
"all
right.
we
will
immunize
you."
whereas
it
could
have
opted
for
the
alternate
course
of
saying,
"we
challenge
your
claim
for
--
that
an
answer
to
that
testimony
would
incriminate
you,
and
let's
go
up
before
the
judge
and
have
a
hearing
on
contempt
for
failure
to
answer
the
question."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
really
lead
to
a
very
principled
distinction,
does
it,
once
we
get
to
the
use
of
immunized
testimony
to
prove
perjury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
do
--
all
of
those
lead
to
very
ad
hoc
distinctions,
don't
they?
once
you
concede
that
you
can
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
on
the
basis
of
immunized
testimony,
and
yet
you
say
that
you
have
limits
such
as
the
third
circuit
imposed,
you
are
going
to
have
a
--
very
much
of
a
case-by-case
analysis
as
to
how
much
of
the
immunized
testimony
you
can
use,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
reason
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
for
the
grant
of
immunity,
the
government
never
would
have
been
able
to
ask
the
defendant
any
question,
and
there
never
would
have
been
any
possibility
of
perjury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
on
the
first
day
he
said
--
he
was
asked,
"were
you
there?"
--
and
he
says,
"yes."
on
the
day
he
is
asked,
"were
you
there?"
and
he
says,
"no."
can
the
government
use
both
of
those
statements
in
the
prosecution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
just
a
"but
for"
test
which
would
exclude
a
perjury
prosecution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
are
in
a
really
ad
hoc
area,
when
you
start
arguing
about,
was
it
inconsistent
or
was
it
not
inconsistent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
united
states
against
apfelbaum,
the
question
is
whether
a
witness
granted
use
immunity
under
section
6002
may
subsequently
be
prosecuted
for
false
statements
made
during
the
course
of
his
immunized
testimony.
here,
respondent
apfelbaum
invoked
his
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
while
being
questioned
before
a
grand
jury
in
philadelphia.
the
district
judge
granted
him
immunity
under
the
statute
and
ordered
him
to
testify.
during
his
testimony,
apfelbaum
made
statements
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
his
subsequent
indictment
and
conviction
for
false
swearing.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
the
conviction
because
of
the
district
court
admitted
into
evidence
relevant
portion
of
apfelbaum's
grand
jury
testimony
that
had
not
been
alleged
in
the
indictment
to
constitute
the
corpus
delicti
or
core
of
the
false
statements
offense.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
holding.
we
hold
that
neither
the
statute
nor
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
--
an
admissibility
of
immunized
testimony
be
governed
by
any
different
rules
than
other
testimony
at
a
trial
for
making
false
statements.
section
6002,
the
statute
explicitly
accepts
prosecutions
for
perjury
and
for
making
false
statements
from
the
scope
of
its
immunity.
the
statute
makes
no
distinction
between
statements
alleged
as
the
corpus
delicti
or
core
of
the
offense
and
other
statements
made
during
the
giving
of
immunized
testimony.
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
shows
that
congress
intended
perjury
and
false
declarations
exceptions
to
be
interpreted
as
broadly
as
constitutionally
permissible.
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
--
compulsory
self-incrimination
does
not
limit
that
statute
here
because
the
privilege
does
not
extend
to
hazards
of
incrimination
that
are
merely
trifling
or
imaginary.
rather
the
hazard
must
be
substantial
and
real
at
the
time
a
witness
asserts
the
privilege.
at
the
time
a
witness,
the
respondent
assert
his
fifth
amendment
privilege,
he
had
neither
committed
the
false
swearing
offense
of
which
he
was
later
convicted
nor
had
he
taken
any
active
steps
that
would
suggest
he
was
committed
to
make
the
false
statements.
indeed
at
this
point
he
could
have
done
no
more
than
formulate
a
future
intent
to
commit
perjury.
this
hazard
is
not
by
itself
sufficient
to
justify
invocation
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
blackmun
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall
has
also
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
only
in
the
judgment
--
concurring
and
dissenting.
