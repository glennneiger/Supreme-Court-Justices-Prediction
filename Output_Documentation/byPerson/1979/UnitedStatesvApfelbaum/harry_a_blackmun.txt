mr.
bryson,
i
want
to
be
sure,
you
outlined
two
prongs
to
your
argument
a
little
while
ago.
do
you
rely
on
both
of
them
or
on
--
if
not,
on
which?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
certainly
is
court
of
appeals
authority
based
on
the
first
prong.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
cite
the
cases,
but
you
don't
rely
on
the
theory,
as
i
read
your
brief.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
this
one
suppose,
during
the
grand
jury
testimony
after
the
grant
of
immunity,
the
witness
truthfully
stated
that
he
had
committed
perjury
on
a
prior
occasion.
does
the
grant
of
immunity
prevent
the
government
from
prosecuting
him
for
that
perjury?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
you
are
really
relying
on
that
one
prong,
and
not
on
the
other
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
we
go
back
for
just
a
moment
to
the
two
alternative
bases
for
the
government's
position,
and
is
it
your
view
that
testimony
about
future
crimes
is
simply
not
protected
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
as
a
constitutional
matter?
forget
the
statute.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
grand
jury
calls
the
witness
in
and
says,
"we
want
to
ask
you
about
this
bank
robbery
that
you
are
planning
for
next
week"
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
and
he
claimed
a
privilege,
you
would
say
he
had
no
privilege.
