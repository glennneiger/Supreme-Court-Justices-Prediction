mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
just
go
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
to
a
certain
extent,
mr.
apfelbaum
was
charged
with
two
counts
of
making
false
statements
before
the
united
states
grand
jury.
count
one
charged
that
he
was
not
truthful
when
he
denied
trying
to
attempting
to
locate
an
individual
by
the
name
of
harry
brown
in
florida
in
december
of
1975.
count
two
charged
that
mr.
apfelbaum
was
not
truthful
when
he
denied
in
the
grand
jury
that
he
told
two
f.b.i.
agents
that
--
who
had
interviewed
him,
that
he
had
lent
mr.
brown
$10,000.
in
addition
to
--
these
are
the
grand
--
these
are
the
statements
made
in
the
grand
jury
that
constituted
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
false
swearing
offenses.
the
government
proved
with
extrinsic
evidence,
apart
from
the
grand
jury
testimony,
what
is
probably
the
falsity
of
these
two
grand
jury
statements.
number
one,
they
had
six
or
seven
witnesses
who
--
independent
witnesses,
who
showed
that
mr.
apfelbaum
did
in
fact
attempt
to
locate
mr.
brown
in
florida
in
december,
1955.
they
were
essentially
school
teachers,
and
nonbiased,
nontainted
witnesses
of
good
credibility.
with
respect
to
the
count
two,
the
two
f.b.i.
agents
testified,
agents
dennis
and
perry,
that
on
--
i
believe
the
date
was
march
16,
1976
--
they
appeared
at
the
district
attorney's
office
in
philadelphia,
introduced
themselves
to
mr.
apfelbaum,
and
he
told
them
that
--
among
other
things
that
they
testified
to
--
that
mr.
apfelbaum
said
he
lent
harry
brown
$10,000.
now
the
government,
at
the
trial,
introduced
not
only
this
extrinsic
evidence
but
they
attempted
to
introduce
truthful,
immunized
testimony
to
prove,
as
they
said,
that
--
and
argued
to
the
jury
that
the
truthful,
immunized
testimony
somehow,
in
some
way,
was
relevant
to
the
charges.
now
i
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
if
he
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
if
the
witness
conceded
that
the
testimony
on
the
prior
occasion
was
false
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
--
there
is
now
evidence
of
falsity
in
the
record
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
--
the
prior
testimony
is
no
longer
truthful
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
--
and
that
is
the
dunn
case,
i
would
agree
that
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
but
there
is
now
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
the
distinction
i
am
drawing
is
this
that
the
immunized
testimony
you
are
using
on
day
one
is
now
concededly
false
immunized
testimony
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
the
government
will
prove
it
with
the
second
appearance
of
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
assuming
that
the
second
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
is
truthful,
but
there
is
now
an
acknowledgement
that
the
first
testimony
is
false.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
i
understand
that.
in
contrast
to
that
case,
in
this
case
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
that
the
--
i
would
agree
it
is
proper
only
because
there
is
now
in
the
record
an
acknowledgement
of
false
immunized
testimony.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
my
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
that
is
right.
now,
in
contrast
to
the
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
i
agree
with
that.
my
claim
here
is,
number
one,
there
was
absolutely
no
concession
that
mr.
apfelbaum's
immunized
grand
jury
testimony
was
false,
in
contrast
to
the
situation
that
was
just
raised.
we
don't
concede
for
one
minute
that
what
mr.
apfelbaum
was
required
to
do
under
the
grant
of
immunity,
and
the
compulsion
which
was
--
he
didn't
want
to
do
it,
against
his
will
--
and
that
is,
he
was
required
to
testify
truthfully
in
the
grand
jury.
now,
when
he
did
that,
it
appears
that
he
exposed
himself
to
having
his
truthful
immunized
testimony
used
against
him
in
the
perjury
prosecution.
in
other
cases,
in
the
hockenberry
case
in
the
third
circuit,
there
was
a
prosecution
for
perjury
given
during
the
course
of
immunized
testimony.
the
defendant
took
the
witness
stand
and
testified,
and
the
court
held
that
even
in
the
prosecution
for
perjury,
the
incriminating
truth
could
not
be
used
against
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
--
in
the
perjury
prosecution.
the
same
thing
is
the
rule
in
the
second
circuit.
hockenberry
was
a
third
circuit
case.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
that
is
a
distinct
possibility.
the
only
way
to
overcome
it
is
for
the
court
to
announce
a
rule
which
would
protect
the
incriminating
truth,
but
still
permit
the
government
to
prosecute
a
person
who
--
for
perjury
who
perjures
himself
during
the
course
of
his
testimony.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
i
would
--
in
other
words
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
is
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
is
your
honor
saying
that
apart
from
the
two
appearances
before
the
grand
jury,
there
is
a
sworn
statement
in
which
he
is
admitting
that
his
testimony
was
false,
on
the
outside?
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
my
position
is,
under
those
circumstances,
that
the
--
there
could
be
--
that
the
truthful
admissions
made
in
the
grand
jury
on
one
of
the
two
occasions,
that
is,
there
being
two
apparent
inconsistencies,
could
not
be
used
against
the
witness
for
a
prosecution
for
perjury,
because
in
fact
the
government
would
be
using
against
him,
truthful
immunized
testimony,
and
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
record
other
than
the
inconsistencies,
to
show
the
false
statements.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
that
is
correct,
and
i
have
absolutely
no
problem
with
that
concept.
i
am
saying,
if
a
witness
lies,
prosecute
him
for
perjury.
prosecute
him
for
false
swearing.
that
is
not
what
i
am
arguing
here
today,
that
no
possible
prosecution
for
those
things
could
occur.
my
argument
is
that,
in
the
course
of
the
testimony,
when
the
witness
gives
truthful
incriminating
admissions
and
those
admissions
--
which
are
compelled
admissions,
he
is
giving
them
involuntarily
--
when
those
admissions
are
later
used
against
him
in
the
perjury
prosecution,
then
there
is
a
definite
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
under
the
inconsistent
declaration
provision
of
18
u.s.c.
1623,
that
a
prosecution
could
not
lie
under
that
situation.
the
only
exception
that
i
know
of,
and
that
has
been
the
uniform
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
exception
i
know
of
in
that
regard
is
the
dunn
case,
and
that
is
only
because
the
defendant
admitted
that
he
testified
falsely
on
a
different
occasion.
i
might
say
that
the
--
in
new
jersey
v.
portash,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
last
march
--
the
defendant
in
that
case,
who
agreeably
was
not
charged
with
perjury,
took
the
witness
stand,
or
would
have
taken
the
witness
stand
and
testified
to
events
a.
his
legislatively-immunized
grand
jury
testimony
was
absolutely
inconsistent
with
his
testimony
that
would
have
been
given,
had
he
testified
at
the
trial
for
his
misconduct.
this
court
held
that
the
legislatively-immunized
and
jury
testimony
could
not
be
used,
even
though
it
was
inconsistent,
could
not
be
used
against
him;
and
i
believe
it
was
a
7-2
opinion,
and
even
the
dissents
in
the
opinion
did
not
disagree
with
the
majority.
it
was
basically
a
jurisdictional
argument
on
dissent.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
the
portash
v.
new
jersey,
that
the
inconsistent,
immunized
testimony
could
not
be
used
against
mr.
portash
in
that
prosecution.
there
you
have
concededly
false
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
it
was
not
a
perjury
prosecution.
now,
i
might
say
that
in
the
tramunti
case,
in
the
second
circuit,
there
was
a
perjury
prosecution.
in
that
case
the
defendant
did
testify
and
conceded
that
his
immunized
--
his
prior
immunized
testimony
was
false.
the
court
said
that
under
that
circumstance,
the
rule
in
the
second
circuit
is
that
the
defendant
could
be
impeached
with
false
immunized
testimony,
because
the
false
testimony
has
absolutely
no
constitutional
protection.
there
are
instances
where
--
as
i
have
indicated,
where
the
courts
have
uniformly
excluded
the
use
of
truthful
immunized
testimony
in
the
perjury
prosecution.
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of,
in
which
the
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
the
reason
is
that
the
immunity
grant
must
be
coextensive
with
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
it
displaces.
but
for
the
grant
of
immunity,
the
government
wouldn't
have
possession
of
the
truthful
immunized
testimony
to
use
against
the
defendant.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
i
agree
with
that.
really,
the
issue
comes
down
to,
is
when
the
government
has
extrinsic
evidence
of
perjury
against
a
defendant
who
testifies
repeatedly
in
front
of
the
grand
jury,
but
does
the
defendant
in
being
compelled
to
testify,
forfeit
all
his
fifth
amendment
rights
with
respect
to
his
truthful
testimony?
in
this
case,
mr.
apfelbaum
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
after
being
granted
immunity,
on
two
occasions,
december
13,
1976,
and
january
3,
1977.
in
effect,
the
government,
the
second
time
he
appeared,
had
the
transcript
of
his
prior
immunized
testimony.
in
effect,
they
went
over
a
second
time
what
he
testified
to
on
the
first
occasion
before
the
grand
jury.
they
could
have
subpoenaed
him
a
third
time,
and
a
fourth
time,
and
now
they
are
arguing
that
testimony
that
is
contemporaneously
given,
even
if
truthful,
could
be
used
against
the
defendant
for
--
in
a
prosecution
for
perjury.
doesn't
this
expose
the
defendant
to
claims
of
perjury
in
different,
noncontemporaneous
grand
jury
proceedings,
based
upon
different
aspects
of
the
government's
investigation.
i
can
foresee
a
perjury
indictment
containing
six
different
appearances
before
the
grand
jury,
and
the
government
claiming
that
the
six
are
unrelated
but
all
the
truthful
testimony
given
during
each
session
of
the
grand
jury
has
forfeited
its
fifth
amendment
privilege,
because
he
lied
in
one
or
two
respects,
and
therefore
we
can
use
against
you
in
the
perjury
prosecution
the
balance
of
the
immunized
--
truthful
immunized
testimony,
only
because
it
relates
to
the
particular
perjury
given
during
the
grand
jury.
it
could
result
in
a
very
heinous
situation,
when
in
fact
the
defendant
is
in
a
situation
where,
on
an
involuntary
basis,
he
is
being
forced
to
testify.
concededly,
in
part,
he
is
doing
the
very
thing
that
the
immunity
grant
forces
him
to
do,
and
that
is
to
testify
truthfully.
the
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
i
wouldn't
make
that
argument,
but
with
respect
to
the
government's
example
of,
in
the
grand
jury,
a
threat
against
the
president,
isn't
that
a
present
crime
being
committed
during
the
course
of
the
immunized
grand
jury
testimony?
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
that
is
the
reason
why
the
future
--
the
claim
of
the
government
that
future
grand
jury
testimony
--
that
the
immunity
grant
doesn't
protect
future
crimes
or
future
perjury,
must
fail,
because
the
defendant
is
committing
a
present
crime
and
the
statute
is
permitting
the
prosecution
for
perjury.
this
might
be
a
hypertechnical
distinction,
but
the
statute
only
says
that
the
immunized
testimony
may
be
used
--
it
gives
an
exception.
it
says,
"except
a
prosecution
for
perjury,
etcetera."
it
doesn't
say,
"except
in
a
prosecution
for
perjury."
my
argument
really
is
the
absence
of
that
minute
word
"in"
doesn't
really
mean
that
the
government
has
the
wholesale
right,
because
--
to
use
the
immunized
grand
jury
testimony
that
is
truthful.
the
statute
really,
concededly,
is
unclear
in
covering
the
issue
that
i
raised
in
the
third
circuit,
where
i
won
before
its
unanimous
three-judge
panel,
or
the
issue
revised
by
the
government
here.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
my
experience
has
been
that
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
he
is
not
being
permitted
to
lie.
he
is
sworn
to
tell
the
truth
in
the
grand
jury.
the
oath
compels
him
to
tell
the
truth.
it
is
the
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
i
am
not
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
hold
that
mr.
apfelbaum
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
perjury.
what
i
am
asking
the
court
to
do,
is
to
restrict
the
use
that
the
government
could
make
of
truthful
immunized
testimony,
because
the
oath
itself
requires
him
to
tell
the
truth.
the
immunity
grant
requires
him
to
tell
the
truth.
he
has
been
instructed
by
the
district
court
under
18
u.s.c.
6002
that
he
must
tell
the
truth
in
the
grand
jury,
and
now,
once
he
tells
the
truth
in
certain
parts,
the
government
is
turning
around
and
saying,
"we
are
going
to
use
the
truth
against
you
as
substantive
evidence
in
our
case
in
chief,
to
prove
the
perjury."
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
uh
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
assuming
the
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
mr.
justice
marshall,
when
you
say
you
can
do
it
with
any
other
witness,
i
must
admit
i
am
unclear
in
what
respect
your
honor
means
that.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
yes,
sir.
that
is
a
vastly
different
situation
from
a
person
who
is
involuntarily
in
the
grand
jury,
forced
to
testify
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
that
is
the
distinction
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
--
and
i
consider
it
to
be
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
--
a
very
vast
distinction.
i
am
not
claiming
that,
if
there
was
no
immunity
grant
here,
that
the
truthful
immunized
testimony
could
not
be
used
against
him.
if
a
person
goes
into
a
grand
jury
voluntarily,
and
testifies,
so
be
it.
the
government
is
in
a
very
enviable
situation
in
that
regard,
but
here
there
is
a
vast
difference,
is
the
grant
of
immunity
which
the
witness
didn't
want
in
the
first
place.
in
fact,
mr.
apfelbaum
did
six
days
for
contempt
of
court
before
he
agreed
to
testify
in
the
grand
jury,
and
thereafter
when
he
went
into
the
grand
jury,
the
incriminating
truth
on
a
later
occasion
was
used
against
him.
kastigar
is
very
broad
in
saying
that
the
truth
--
immunized
testimony
--
i
think
really
this
and
the
dunn
case
is
the
first
time
where
this
court
has
faced
the
issue
of
truthful
versus
false
--
the
use
of
truthful
versus
false
compelled
testimony,
but
kastigar
said
that
the
immunized
testimony
can
not
be
used
in
any
respect
save
the
exceptions
in
the
statute,
and
i
would
agree
that
it
could
be
used
in
a
variety
of
civil
matters
as
the
courts
have
so
held,
but
that
is
not
this
situation,
and
the
new
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
it
didn't
say,
"in
a
prosecution
for
perjury."
it
just
says,
"except
a
prosecution
for
perjury.
"
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
i
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
i
would
agree
to
that.
i
am
just
drawing
the
distinction
because
the
prosecution
for
perjury
is
a
criminal
case
like
any
other
criminal
case,
and
when
a
defendant
finds
himself
in
a
situation
where
the
incriminating
truth
is
being
used
against
him,
and
the
government
wouldn't
have
the
evidence
but
for
the
grant
of
immunity,
the
statute
really
doesn't
say
the
extent
to
which
the
truthful
immunized
testimony
can
be
used.
my
argument
is
that
it
can't
be
used
at
all
against
a
defendant
in
these
prosecutions.
certainly
it
couldn't
be
used
in
the
portash
case,
if
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
it
couldn't
be
used
in
the
portash
case,
in
the
government's
case
in
chief,
and
i
am
claiming
was
it
can't
be
used
in
the
government's
case
in
chief
also.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
testimony
b
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
and
the
witness
has
conceded
that
that
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
so
in
other
words,
he
is
conceding
that
the
one
on
the
first
occasion
is
false?
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
the
--
only
because
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
my
answer
is
"yes,"
but
only
because
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
--
only
because
of
that
concession.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
if
the
court
has
before
it
evidence
of
falsity
on
the
prior
occasion,
then
that
can
be
used,
but
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
justice
white,
i
take
that
position
because
i
think
it
is
the
correct
position,
and
because
i
know
that
it
was
the
position
taken
in
the
dunn
case.
if
a
person
admits
his
perjury,
why
should
he
escape
the
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
the
contrary
--
the
admission
--
the
contrary
answer
would
be
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
offense,
but
that
is
concededly
false,
and
the
government
has
to
prove
it
is
false,
and
there
is
a
concession
of
falsity
there.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
i
am
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
again,
that
is
a
concession
i
am
making,
but
that
is
a
vastly
different
factual
situation
from
the
case
here.
in
the
case
here,
number
one,
there
is
no
concession
that
the
testimony
was
truthful.
number
two,
there
is
absolutely
no
inconsistency
between
the
testimony
that
is
contained
as
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
offense
and
the
balance
of
the
truthful
testimony.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
i
would
answer
that
the
answer
is
"no".
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
because
there
is
no
evidence
or
no
concession
from
the
witness
of
falsity.
that
is
a
decision
that
will
have
to
be
made
by
a
jury
on
a
later
occasion.
that
is
the
very
situation
in
the
inconsistent
declarations
situation,
that
the
courts
have
said
is
tantamount
to
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
because
you
are
using
against
the
witness
truthful
immunized
testimony.
i
draw
the
very
--
the
only
distinction
i
make
between
that
situation
and
justice
white,
is
that
there
is
a
concession
by
the
witness
that
he
lied.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
well,
i
--
it
has
been
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
dunn
case,
that
there
could
be
a
perjury
prosecution
under
that
circumstance.
i
don't
consider
it
to
be
an
exception
to
what
i
am
advocating
here,
which
is
that
truthful
immunized
testimony
could
never
be
used
against
a
defendant.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
court
below,
was
quite
clear
in
the
frumento
case,
that
was
an
en
banc
court,
that
truthful
immunized
testimony
could
not
be
used
even
in
the
--
even
when
there
is
an
inconsistency.
the
--
justice
white's
example
is
an
unusual
one,
in
that
there
is
a
concession
of
falsity.
if
there
was
no
concession
of
falsity,
i
would
say
that
the
truthful
immunized
testimony
could
not
be
used,
but
in
any
event,
that
is
the
18
u.s.c.
1623
situation.
it
is
vastly
different,
i
would
say,
from
the
situation
in
which
mr.
apfelbaum
found
himself,
in
which
testimony
that
wasn't
inconsistent
with
the
two
claimed
instances
of
falsity
in
the
indictment
charged
against
him,
was
being
used
against
him
to
prove
that
he
lied.
he
didn't
--
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
harvey
slomsky
yes,
sir.
i
consider
the
inconsistent
declaration
situation
to
be
a
very
novel
exception
that
really
has
to
be
decided
as
--
more
or
less
as
an
exception
to
the
general
rule,
if
that
kind
of
prosecution
is
going
to
be
permitted.
in
my
situation,
it
could
happen
far
more
frequently
than
that
one,
where
a
witness
during
the
course
of
his
grand
jury
testimony
which
is
immunized,
finds
himself
giving
truthful
admissions
of
prior
wrongdoing,
and
finding
that
the
government
now
is
permitted
to
use
those
truthful
admissions
of
wrongdoing
against
him
in
a
perjury
prosecution.
that
is
a
much
broader,
and
i
think
a
much
more
heinous
situation
than
the
situation
involving
the
inconsistent
declarations.
the
only
other
fact
i
would
like
to
say
is
that,
as
the
second
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
and
even
the
other
circuits
have
recognized,
the
court
should
be
vigorous
to
permit
a
perjury
prosecution
when
a
person
lies,
but
also
equally
vigorous
in
protecting
the
other
interest
here
which
is
so
vital,
and
that
is,
protecting
the
incriminating
truth.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
one
doesn't
forfeit
his
fifth
amendment
rights
that
are
set
forth
in
the
constitution
when
he
is
granted
immunity,
and
that
if
the
incriminating
truth
is
permitted
to
be
used
against
him,
then
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
thank
you.
