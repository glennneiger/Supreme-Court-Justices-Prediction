justice
potter
stewart
just,
before
you
go
on,
maybe
i
am
wasting
even
more
time,
but
am
i
incorrect
in
my
assumption,
my
understanding
that
this
basic
question
isn't
in
issue
in
this
case?
doesn't
the
respondent
concede
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
can
be
a
prosecution
for
perjury
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
don't
let
me
waste
any
more
of
your
time.
justice
potter
stewart
besides
the
corpus
delicti,
the
false
testimony
is
on
day
one,
but
on
day
two
he
says
something
that
--
and
on
this
occasion,
he
says
that
that
was
false.
so
you
are
using
a
--
some
immunized
testimony
to
prove
that
he
testified
on
day
one
falsely.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
how
do
you
prove
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
are
using
it
by
other
testimony
before
the
same
grand
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
a
perjury
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
about
--
go
back
to
my
example,
as
i
was
mooting
with
you,
testimony
day
one,
testimony
a,
day
two,
testimony
b,
and
they
are
flatly
in
conflict,
and
the
second
time
he
says,
"i
lied
the
first
time."
now,
do
you
say
that
testimony
b
can't
be
used?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
second
day,
and
it
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
testimony
a
on
the
first
day.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
says
--
he
says
--
and
the
prosecutor
says,
"well,
didn't
you
testify
just
to
the
contrary
yesterday."
he
says,
"yes."
"well,
which
one
is
true?"
and
he
says,
"the
one
today."
justice
potter
stewart
right.
now,
may
you
use
the
answer,
the
answer
to
the
question
on
the
second
day?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes,
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
you
do
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
may
not
be
an
argument
against
you
or
your
suggestion,
but
it
is
going
to
mean
a
very
difficult
development
in
perjured
reports
