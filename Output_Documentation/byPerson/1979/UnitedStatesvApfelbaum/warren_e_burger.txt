we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-972,
united
states
against
apfelbaum.
mr.
bryson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
understand
the
center
of
your
argument
is
that
the
immunity
can
not
give
him
protection
for
a
crime
not
yet
committed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
slomsky?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
justice
white's
question
to
you.
this
is
hypothetical.
on
day
one,
he
testifies
to
some
facts.
on
day
two,
he
does
not
admit
that
those
previous
statements
were
false,
but
the
government
introduces
a
sworn
statement
of
his
that
is
just
to
the
contrary.
now
that
is
extrinsic
evidence,
not
out
of
his
own
mouth
at
the
time.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
he
is
later
prosecuted
for
perjury
before
the
grand
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
the
immunity
protects
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
admitting
it,
it
is
just
totally
contrary,
just
totally
contrary,
showing
that
his
testimony
on
day
one
was
false
by
the
piece
of
paper
which
the
government
introduces
on
day
two,
which
shows
that
it
was
false.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
haven't
we
said
in
several
opinions
that
a
grant
of
immunity
does
not
confer
a
privilege
to
lie?
isn't
that
almost
verbatim
out
of
one
of
our
opinions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
altered
my
hypothesis.
my
hypothesis
is
that
they
are
untruthful
statements
to
the
grand
jury,
which
is
demonstrated
by
extrinsic
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
case
were
you
referring
to,
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
wouldn't
contend,
i
suppose,
that
if
in
the
grand
jury
room
he
picked
up
a
chair
and
hit
the
prosecutor
over
the
head,
that
he
was
immune
from
prosecution
for
that
act
on
the
ground
that
but
for
the
grant
of
immunity
he
wouldn't
even
have
been
there,
would
you?
would
you
make
that
kind
of
an
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
perjury
before
the
grand
jury
a
present
crime
committed
before
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
bryson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apparently
not.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

and
