justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
are
still
using
his
acknowledgement
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
would
be
proper?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
so
you
would
say
the
government
could
use
his
testimony
on
day
two
to
prove
that
his
testimony
on
day
one
was
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
if
it
is
in
form
of
an
acknowledgement
of
falsity?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
slomsky,
on
that
point
on
the
wording
of
the
exception,
you
indicated
that
you
thought
there
was
some
significance
to
the
word
"in"
being
omitted,
but
i
am
not
sure
it
really
is
omitted.
it
says,
"no
testimony,"
and
so
forth,
"may
be
used
against
a
witness
in
any
criminal
case
except
a
prosecution
for
perjury."
how
could
you
have
the
"in"
more
plainly
in
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
an
exception
from
the
category
in
any
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
universe
is
all
criminal
cases,
with
one
exception.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wasn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
then
you
do
say
that
you
may
use
some
truthful
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
--
you
do.
you
do.
he
says
that
he
--
he
testifies
flatly
to
the
contrary,
and
says
that
"i
am
speaking
truthfully
today."
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can
use
not
only
his
admission,
but
his
contrary
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
could
use
his
answer,
his
contrary
answer
on
the
second
day,
which
was
true
--
justice
byron
r.
white
"were
you
there?"
"were
you
there,"
and
he
says,
"yes,
i
was
there,"
on
the
second
day.
he
had
said,
"no,
i
wasn't
there,"
on
the
first
day.
and
the
prosecutor
says,
"well,
did
you
lie
yesterday?"
and
he
says,
"yes."
