justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
suppose
on
the
first
day
of
the
grand
jury
he
answers
a
question
a
certain
way,
and
then
the
government
cross
examines
him,
and
the
next
day
you
show
him
some
document
and
he
finally
says
--
well,
he
answers
the
same
question
another
way,
and
he
says,
"i
have
just
lied
yesterday.
i
thought
i
could
get
away,
but
i
can't."
now,
if
the
government
prosecuted
him
for
perjury,
your
position
is,
you
could
use
both
--
the
answers
to
both
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
isn't
any
different
than
what
you
are
saying
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
didn't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
immunity
wouldn't
cover
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
the
statute
clearly
goes
beyond
what
was
required
by
the
constitution
under
your
future
offense
theory,
because
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
any
future
offense
except
perjury.
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
mean
to
say
the
statute
should
be
read
to
say
it
doesn't
apply
to
these
three
exceptions,
or
to
anything
else
the
constitution
would
tolerate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
slomsky,
how
about
my
question
to
counsel.
suppose
on
day
one
he
answered
a
and
the
next
day
b,
in
flat
contradiction,
and
conceded
that
he
just
lied
yesterday
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
the
government
prosecuted
him
for
perjury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
well,
then,
i
know,
but
you
are
still
using
so-called
"immunized"
testimony
to
prove
perjury.
