couldn't
it
be
argued
that
a
day's
pay
is
discipline?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
it
be
argued?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
have
a
little
trouble.
what
would
you
do
if
the
man
says,
"look,
i
just
won't
work."
and
you
say,
"well,
you
don't
work,
i
won't
pay."
is
that
discipline?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
not
talking
--
i'm
talking
about
this
case.
what
could
you
do
other
than
what
you
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
number
one,
you
couldn't
pay
him
for
not
working.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
pay
him
when
he's
on
sick
leave.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
they
got
a
union
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
other
hand,
you
could
just
--
the
man
might
have
to
work,
and
he
gets
killed;
it
wouldn't
hurt
you
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
if
he
had
to
work.
and
that
broke
again,
and
he
died.
that
wouldn't
cost
you
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
have
workmen's
comp;
you've
already
paid
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
one
thing
--
back
up
a
minute
--
in
a
case
just
like
this
where
the
man
says,
"look,
one
or
two
or
three
people
have
fallen
through
there,
and
i'm
not
going
up
there."
and
the
supervisor
says,
"well,
you've
got
to
go."
he
says,
"i
won't
go."
he
says,
"well,
go
home."
now,
suppose
he
just
stays
home.
suppose
nobody
does
anything
from
then
on.
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
are
some
plants
where
you
couldn't
find
alternative
work.
for
example,
the
asbestos
plants.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
