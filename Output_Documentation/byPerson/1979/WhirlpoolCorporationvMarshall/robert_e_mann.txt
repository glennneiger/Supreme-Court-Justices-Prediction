mr.
robert
e.
mann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
robert
mann.
i
represent
the
petitioner,
whirlpool
corporation,
in
this
proceeding.
this
case
raises
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
and
specifically,
whether
under
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
of
1970,
congress
intended
to
confer
certain
job
security
rights
upon
employees
who
might
refuse
to
work
because
of
perceived
safety
hazards.
the
secretary
of
labor,
in
1973,
published
a
regulation
purporting
to
interpret
the
act,
and
stating
in
the
regulation
that,
as
a
general
rule,
the
legislative
history
and
the
act
itself
indicated
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
job
security
rights
within
the
context
of
osha
for
employees
who
might
refuse
to
work
because
of
perceived
safety
hazards.
within
the
interpretative
regulation,
however,
but
without
citing
any
legislative
history
or
other
source,
the
secretary
of
labor
hypothesized
situations
which
might
give
rise
to
such
job
security
provisions
if
an
employee
refused
work
in
imminent
danger
conditions,
when
resort
to
the
normal
enforcement
procedures
were
not
available.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
no,
there
was
not,
your
honor.
it
was
published
as
an
interpretative
regulation,
and
not
as
a
rulemaking
or
legislative
type
regulation.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
i
believe
so;
yes,
your
honor.
whirlpool
corporation
agrees
with
the
secretary
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
and
the
act
itself,
clearly
demonstrate
that
it
was
not
congress'
intent
to
legislate
job
security
provisions
within
the
scope
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
except
perhaps
in
connection
with
the
protection
of
employees
to
invoke
the
procedures
of
the
act.
however,
it
is
our
position,
and
we
believe
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate,
that
that
type
of
exception
would
not
exist
in
this
case,
since
the
work
refusal
occurred
outside
the
scope
or
context
of
any
attempt
to
invoke
the
statutory
procedures.
the
case
arose
in
june
and
july
of
1974.
it
arose
at
whirlpool's
marion,
ohio,
plant.
and
on
the
night
--
on
the
day
shift
of
june
28th,
1974,
an
employee
who
was
working
at
that
plant,
on
a
normal
maintenance
assignment
on
the
overhead
guard
screen
in
the
plant,
fell
between
two
panels
of
the
screen
and
sustained
fatal
injuries.
following
that
accident,
whirlpool
notified
osha
of
the
fatality.
and
on
july
1st,
1974,
an
osha
inspector
conducted
an
inspection
in
relation
to
the
accident.
he
informed
management
at
the
conclusion
of
his
inspection
that
he
felt
the
accident
was
a
result
of
a
mechanical
failure,
an
unforeseeable
accident.
on
july
7th,
1974,
two
other
maintenance
employees
who
were
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
as
the
administrative
hearing
developed
later,
your
honor,
it
appeared
two
bolts,
holding
together
portions
of
the
screen,
failed,
and
caused
the
screen
to
separate
at
one
point;
and
the
employee
stepped
through
the
separation.
that
was
brought
out
in
the
subsequent
citation
proceeding.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
didn't
pick
the
facts,
but
those
are
the
facts.
and
we
candidly
admit
that
they
are
the
facts.
on
june
--
july
7th
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that
is
not
--
that
question
has
not
been
the
central
question
in
the
litigation,
your
honor.
the
question,
the
central
question,
in
the
litigation
has
been
whether
or
not
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
act
is
in
accordance
with
the
legislative
intent
compiled
by
senator
williams
in
his
legislative
booklet.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
in
the
interpretation
of
the
act
to
provide
protections
for
employees
who
refuse
work
assignments.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
the
secretary's
authorization
to
promulgate
regulations
under
the
statute
exists
with
respect
to
the
promulgation
of
standards,
uniform
standards,
of
course;
and
also,
under
section
8(g),
publication
of
regulations
governing
his
own
responsibilities
under
the
act.
we
do
not
read
the
act
to
provide
him
plenary
regulatory
authority
to,
in
effect,
issue
legislative-type
regulations
under
the
act.
and
i
don't
believe
the
secretary
has
contended
that
this
particular
regulation
is
a
legislative-type
regulation.
he
is
attempting
to
interpret
section
11(c)
of
the
act
to
find
that
under
certain
circumstances
an
employee
would
have
a
right
to
refuse
a
work
assignment
without
regard
to
the
employment
consequences
of
that
refusal.
on
july
7th,
two
employees
approached
their
supervision
and
asked
to
be
relieved
of
guard
screen
duty.
they
were
denied
in
their
request,
and
on
july
9th,
one
of
the
two
employees
contacted
the
osha
area
director
for
the
region
and
spoke
with
him
about
the
guard
screen.
prior
to
that
contact,
of
course,
the
osha
people
had
conducted
their
inspection,
and
as
it
turned
out
later,
had
already
decided
to
issue
a
citation
with
respect
to
the
guard
screen
system.
the
citation
was
not,
of
course,
however,
received
by
whirlpool
until
the
12th
or
13th
of
july.
on
the
evening
shift
of
july
10th,
a
supervisor
accompanied
the
two
complaining
employees
to
a
section
of
overhead
guard
screen;
climbed
up
to
the
guard
screen,
the
supervisor
did,
and
physically
walked
across
the
guard
screen
for
from
10
to
15
minutes,
approximately
800
feet
in
length,
to
physically
demonstrate
to
these
two
employees
that
the
screen
they
were
to
work
on
that
evening
was
safe.
following
that
physical
demonstration,
he
asked
the
two
employees
to
clean
some
materials
which
had
fallen
on
the
guard
screen,
from
the
guard
screen;
and
they
refused.
they
were
subsequently
issued
a
disciplinary
warning,
lost
four
hours
pay
by
being
suspended,
and
thus
generated
this
particular
litigation.
both
employees
returned
to
work
the
following
day,
and
have
continued
to
work
on
the--one
of
them
has
continued
to
work
on
the
guard
screen
to
date;
the
other
apparently
is
in
another
position.
at
no
time
throughout
this
proceeding
has
the
secretary
of
labor
or
his
delegate
attempted
in
any
way
to
initiate
any
type
of
imminent
danger
proceeding,
as
is
contemplated
under
section
13
of
the
act.
nor,
so
far
as
we
know,
have
the
complaining
employees
attempted
to
initiate
such
a
proceeding
on
their
own,
as
is
their
right
under
section
13
of
the
act.
the
secretary
of
labor's
position
under
this
particular
set
of
facts
is
to
have
processed
this
case
through
the
normal
enforcement
channels
of
citation,
hearing,
and
ultimate
decision
by
the
occupation
safety
and
health
review
commission.
the
complaint
was
filed.
the
federal
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio
ruled
in
the
case
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
regulation
--
of
the
act--was
so
inconsistent,
so
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
the
act
itself
that
he
felt
he
had
no
choice
but
to
reject
the
secretary's
interpretation
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
i
believe
the
district
court's
view
was
that
it
was
tantamount
to
a
strike-with-pay
approach;
it
was
a
type
of
approach
that
had
been
rejected
by
congress,
both
in
connection
with
the
strike-with-pay
issue
and
in
connection
with
the
administrative-shutdown
issue.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
the
court
did
find
that,
your
honor;
yes,
he
did.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
he
found
that
the
danger
was
real.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
he
did
not
find
that
they
lacked
any
alternative,
in
the
sense
that
they
were
precluded
from
using
the
normal
enforcement
procedures
of
the
act,
or
the
extraordinary
enforcement
procedures
of
the
act
under
section
13.
he
made
no
finding
on
that
point.
and
we
think
that
that
point
is
crucial
in
this
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
our
position.
the
secretary,
i
think,
in
his
brief
has
mischaracterized
our
position
on
that
point.
it's
our
view
that
any
employee
under
constitutional
law,
certainly
under
statutory
law,
has
a
right
to
withdraw
from
a
dangerous
situation
on
a
work
site.
the
question
in
the
case
is
not
whether
or
not
he
has
a
right
to
withdraw.
whirlpool
freely
concedes
that.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
the
question
of
his
job
security
and
pay,
we
feel
that
congress
intended
to
leave
for
regulation
to
other
statutes;
except
in
a
case,
perhaps,
where
the
employee
would
leave
his
job
for
the
purpose
of
invoking
the
procedures
available
under
osha.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
if
--
yes,
i
think
section
11
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
your
honor,
the
facts
of
this
case
don't
present
that
situation.
but
i
think
hypothetically,
in
a
case-by-case
analysis,
the
court
could
determine
that
the
employee
might
be
protected
to
the
extent
he
is
in
the
process
of
invoking
or
participating
in
the
procedures.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
i
think
that
under
--
he
could
be
fired,
if
the
reason
for
the
firing
was
not
based
upon
his
having
filed
a
complaint.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
if
the
reason
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
all
right,
it's
our
view,
yes,
sir,
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
--
not
protected
under
osha.
now,
there
may
be
protections
under
other
legislation,
but
not
under
osha.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
it's
our
view
that
he
is
free
not
to
work.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
right.
(laughter)
mr.
robert
e.
mann
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
retains
his
job
security
during
that
period
of
time,
we
feel
congress
did
not
intend
to
regulate
under
this
act.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
our
view;
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
the
one
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
i
believe
it
would
under
the
facts
you
quote,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
i
believe
there
have
been
some
recent
decisions
under
--
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
the
nlra
holding
that
a
single
employee's
withdrawal
may
constitute
protected
activity
under
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
if
it's
a
safety-related
situation.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
he
doesn't
get
paid,
and
he's
on
strike,
but
he
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
he
cannot
be
disciplined,
but
he
doesn't
get
paid.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
correct.
but
i
think
it
--
and
the
problem
is,
what
is
that
additional
protection?
under
the
secretary's
view,
that
additional
protection
is,
in
effect,
pay
for
not
working.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
i,
certainly
i
would
hope
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
no,
we
gave
him
a
warning.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
i
think
there
may
be
a
fight,
your
honor,
in
this
sense.
our
concern
is
that
the
osha
act
attempts,
we
believe,
to
encourage
employees
to
utilize
the
procedures
under
that
act,
and
not
resort
to
self-help;
that
the
resort
to
self-help
is
defeating
the
objects
of
that
act
which
are
to
try
and
eliminate
safety
hazards
through
cooperative
efforts
and
through
orderly
procedures
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary.
now,
we
feel
that
this
regulation,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
presently
utilized
by
the
secretary,
and
interpreted,
has
the
effect
of
encouraging
employees
to
utilize
self-help
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
he
has
the
freedom
to
withdraw
from
work.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
he
doesn't
get
paid.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
the
secretary
takes
the
view
in
his
brief,
and
i
would
point
this
out,
that
the
employee's
right
is
to
be
given
alternate
work.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
if
available.
but
the
dynamics
of
a
workplace,
your
honor,
is
that
there
will
always
be
alternate
work
available,
in
any
type
of
a
reasonably
sized
industry.
that's
going
to
always
happen.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
not
if
an
employee
goes
on
strike.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
he's
out
of
the
plant;
he's
on
strike.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
there's
no
requirement
under
the
labor
act
to
provide
him
some
alternate--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
i
believe
that
judge
keith's
decision
implies
an
obligation
to
pay
the
employee.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
during
that
period
of
time
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
and
to
pay
them,
or
find
alternate
work
for
them.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
he
doesn't
spell
that
out,
but
he
upholds
the
regulation
which
has
that
--
has
that
connotation
to
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
the
secretary
in
his
brief
repeatedly
refers
to
the
obligation
to
find
alternate
work
if
available.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
i
think
he
draws
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
alternate
work
at
some
pay;
perhaps
not
the
same
pay.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
he
doesn't
elaborate
that.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
--
if
he's
not
--
i
believe
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that
the
employer
cannot
discriminate
against
the
employee.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
under
the
secretary's
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
but
under
section
1977.12
of
the
secretary's
regulations,
he
defines
discrimination
in
the
broadest
possible
sense
the
deprivation
of
any
perquisite
of
employment,
or
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
and
we
believe
it
means
pay
for
not
work.
and
that's
exactly
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
it's
not
clear.
but
that's
the
position
that
the
secretary
has
been
taking--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
they're
here
to
pay
his
discipline,
that's
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that
could
be
argued.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
and
that
undoubtedly
would
be
argued.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
i
would
read
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
to
mean
that--or
could
be
construed
to
mean
that
an
employee
may
not
be
discriminated
against,
either
with
respect
to
pay
or
any
other
term
or
condition
of
employment,
if
he
refuses
to
work
under
the
conditions
posed
by
this
regulation.
i
believe
that's
how
the
lower
federal
courts
would
probably
construe
that
regulation,
in
the
dynamics
of
a
particular
case.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
it
means
pay;
and
it
means
pay
for
this
reason,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
while
not
working.
consider
the
employer's
options
under
these
circumstances.
if
the
employee
refuses
to
perform
a
job,
and
the
employer
agrees
that
the
job
should
not
be
performed
and
reassigns
him,
to
that
extent,
the
employer
is
paying
him
but
not
getting
the
work
done
that
the
employee
was
hired
for.
so
that's,
in
a
sense,
a
pay
situation.
if
the
employer
says,
"no,
i
disagree
with
you.
i
believe
that
job
is
safe."
or,
"i
believe
that
i
have
taken
sufficient
steps
to
correct
the
problem,
and
therefore,
i
will
either
discipline
you
or
require
you
to
work
that
job."
once
an
employer
disciplines
the
employee,
you
automatically
have
a
pay
situation.
if
the
employee,
on
the
other
hand,
were
to
actually
just
say,
"i'm
going
on
strike.
i'm
exercising
my
rights
under
section
7,"
then
obviously,
there's
no
pay
situation
there.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
most
collective
bargaining
agreements
call
for
some
provision
of
sick
leave
--
or
make
some
reference
of
that
type,
right.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
it
would
--
i
--
you
mean
as
a
subterfuge
for
not
working?
mr.
robert
e.
mann
oh.
well,
under
those
circumstances,
depending
on
what
his
contract
provided,
he
may
or
may
not
be
paid.
some
do,
and
some
don't.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
denying
him
pay
for
not
working,
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
our
--
yes.
the
supervisor
asked
them
a
couple
of
times
to
work,
and
they
refused.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
there
was
a
dialogue,
and
then
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
there
was
a
final
refusal.
the
matter
was
re-discussed
in
the
personnel
office.
and
the
personnel
director
directed
the
persons
to
go
home
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
and
a
final
refusal.
they
went
home
for
the
balance
of
the
shift.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
correct;
and
returned
the
following
morning.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
they
were
issued
a
written
warning;
it
was
put
in
their
file.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that
was
it.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
oh,
no.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
no.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
we
have
a
statutory
obligation
not
to
discipline
him.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
no,
but
the
reason
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
the
reason
that
it's
not
discipline
is
that
he
is
not
presenting
himself
for
work,
and
he
is
merely
exercising
a
right
that
he
has
under
the
statute.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
they
are
being
--
well,
the
reason
that
they're
going
to
be
paid
for
not
working
is
because
they're
being
disciplined,
or
they're
being
assigned
to
some
other
job.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
it's
the
disciplinary
action
that
triggers
the
pay.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
because
the
employee
is
being
discipline.
in
the
case
of
the
work
refusal,
he's
being
disciplined
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
the
solicitor
has
taken
the
position
in
this
case
that
we
had
an--an
additional
obligation
not
only
not
to
put
the
paper
in
his
file,
but
find
him
an
alternate
work
assignment.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
no,
that
wouldn't
be
true.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
the
obligation
of
the
employer
is
not
to
discriminate
against
him,
including
imposition
of
discipline.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that
could
be
construed
as
discipline;
that
could
be
construed
as
discriminatory
action.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
if
he
had
a
right
to
refuse
that
job
under
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
i
don't
know
what
could
have
been
done
other
than
what
we've
done
in
this
case,
the
issuance
of
discipline.
there
was
a
dispute
over
the
existence
of
a
hazard,
and
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that
may
be
the
policy.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
sick
leave
policy,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
no.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that
would
be
an
approach
that
could
be
taken.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
i
might
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
and
i
might
suggest
that
the
ambiguities
in
the
regulation
itself
tend
to
lend
some
problem
there,
too.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
i
think
any
form
of
discipline
that's
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
there
might
be
a
grievance,
or
he
might
make
a
claim
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
or
some
other
contract.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
if
he
engaged
in
concerted
activity
and
went
on
strike.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
there
have
been
some
recent
decisions
in
that
area.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
no,
the
labor
board,
i
believe,
in
a
case
called
alleluia
cushion
has
taken
a
position
that
there's
a
right
to
engage
in
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
we
would
expect
that
if
the
employee
was
concerned
that
there
was
an
imminent
--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
we
would
hope
that
wouldn't
occur,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
we
feel
that
the
salutary
effects
of
this
act
are
going
to
be
lost
if
we're
litigating
in
federal
court
these
kinds
of
decisions
over
discriminatory
or
disciplinary
actions,
which
really
never
lead
to
the
ultimate
question
of
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
hazards,
or
what
is
needed
to
abate
them.
the
only
question
that's
resolved
by
this
type
of
litigation
is
whether
or
not
discipline
was
proper.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
what
was
in
the
minds.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
contrast
that
with
the
section
13
procedures.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
right.
in
the
section
13
procedures
prescribed
by
congress,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
there's
a
hazard
or
not;
that's
the
issue
to
be
resolved.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
your
honor.
