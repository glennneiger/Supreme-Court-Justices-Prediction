justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
sound
very
mechanical
to
me.
but
it's
--
maybe
it's
just
the
wrong
term.
you
certainly
picked
rather
an
unsympathetic
set
of
facts
for
your
case,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
on
the
theory
it
was
a
strike-with-pay
approach?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
found,
did
it
not,
that
these
employees
had
a
genuine
fear
of
death
or
physical
injury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
danger
was
real?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
they
lacked
any
alternative?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
even
if
they
had
utilized
these
alternative
procedures,
they
were
supposed
to
work
on
the
job
while
these
procedures
were
being
employed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
he
can
keep
his
job?
he
can
keep
his
job
--
he
can
withdraw
and
keep
his
job,
but
he
just
won't
be
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
osha
covers
that,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he's
free
not
to
work;
you
mean
there
is
no
slavery?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
have
to
--
you
don't
have
to
keep
him
as
an
employee,
nor
do
you
have
to
pay
him
while
he's
waiting
for
osha?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
assume
it
would
be
true,
would
it
not,
under
that
case
involving
a
place
of
work
that
was
too
cold,
that
if
three
or
four
of
these
people
got
together
and
said,
"none
of
us
will
work,
because
we
all
want
you
to
remedy
the
situation..."
in
some
way,
that
would
be
protected
under
the
labor
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
it's
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
disclaims
that.
he
says,
no.
he
says
--
that's
how
he
distinguishes
all
this
strike-with-pay
legislative
history.
he
says,
well,
that's
talking
about
paying
him,
and
we
are
not
contending
--
in
other
words,
if
our
opinion
--
say
you
lose
here,
and
we
wrote
an
opinion
that
says
that
man
is
not
entitled
to
be
paid,
would
you
be
perfectly
happy?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
--
you've
told
us
that
at
least
under
some
federal
decisions
that
individual
employee
has
a
--
the
freedom
to
do
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
dangerous
or
intolerable
conditions
of
some
other
kind.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
doesn't
get
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
just
says,
"i
won't
work
because
it's
too
cold
or
dangerous,"
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mann,
may
i
suggest
this
approach,
that
the
statute
and
regulations
say
there
are
certain
kinds
of
things
that
the
employee
has
a
statutory
right
to
do,
such
as
file
complaints.
and
then
there
is
a
provision
that
if
he
does
any
of
those
things,
there
are
certain
things
may
not--he
may
not
be
disciplined
for
them.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
question
of
whether
it's
discipline
would
be
the
same
question
whether
he
refused
to
work
because
he
thought
it
was
dangerous,
or
because
he
went
and
made
a
complaint.
now,
my
question
then
is
supposing
he
didn't
show
up
one
morning,
but
instead
went
over
to
the
osha
office
to
file
a
complaint;
he
had
to
sit
in
the
waiting
room
all
morning
before
they'd
listen
to
him;
he
killed
the
whole
day.
he
showed
up
the
next
day.
would
you
have
a
statutory
obligation
to
pay
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
supposing
he
just
doesn't
work
that
day
because
he
thinks
it's
too
dangerous.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
now
i
--
in
answer
to
justice
stevens,
you
said
that
instead
of
coming
to
work
and
reporting
in
at
the
beginning
of
his
shift,
this
employee
had
gone
to
the
osha
office
in
marion,
ohio,
to
file
a
complaint,
that
under
the
statute,
clearly
you
couldn't
discipline
him
for
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
further
said
that
there's
no
requirement
under
the
statute
that
you
pay
him
for
work
not
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mann,
may
i
suggest
that,
assuming
there's
a
statutory
right
here,
there
are
three
possible
answers
on
the
remedy.
one
is,
you
had
to
pay
him
even
if
he
didn't
work.
and
you
say
that's
what's
implicitly
required,
and
the
other
side
says
no.
secondly,
that
you
could
stick
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
file,
and
that's
discipline.
and
thirdly,
that
you
had
to
give
him
another
job.
now
it's
conceivable
that
you
didn't
have
to
do
any
of
those
three
things.
all
you
had
to
do
was
just
say,
"well,
we
won't
pay
you.
we'll
treat
you
just
like
you're
on
strike."
and
that
would
recognize
the
statutory
right,
and
avoid
all
the--it
may
well
be
that
they
granted
a
remedy
they
had
no
right
to
grant.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
discipline;
any
kind
of
discipline.
like
getting
rid
of
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
some
cases,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
board
taken
a
position
on
that,
or
is
that
just
a
--
is
that
just
a
301
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
another
employee
ever
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
be
discrimination
if
they
paid
the
man
on
the
night
shift
but
not
the
man
on
the
day
shift
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
something
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it's
a
matter
of
statute.
in
the
absence
of
any
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
really
is,
in
many
ways.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
seems
to
me
that
you
and
your
brother
argue
about
something
that
now
you
say
is
not
before
us.
i
had
understood
that
your
position,
and
indeed,
that
judge
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
yes,
damon
keith's
opinion
for
the
sixth
circuit
implied
that
this
person
was
entitled
to
be
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
--
you're
together
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position,
mr.
solicitor
general,
to
say
--
you
are
arguing
that
the
unexpressed,
implicit
right
is
just
as
important
as
the
expressed
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
you
are
suggesting
that
the
remedy
for
violating
the
express
right
is
more
stern
than
the
remedy
for
violating
the
unexpressed
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
statute
--
that
makes
the
statute
very
consistent.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
he
says,
"all
the
other
maintenance
people
are
doing
all
the
other
jobs,
so
there's
nothing
more
for
you
today
to
do
today."
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
