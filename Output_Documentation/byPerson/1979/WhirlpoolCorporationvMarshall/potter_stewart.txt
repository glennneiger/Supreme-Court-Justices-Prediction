justice
potter
stewart
and
the
result
is
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
cannot
be
disciplined;
is
that
the
idea?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
but
my
brother
stevens,
the
hypothesis
of
his
question
was
that
he
wouldn't
get
paid
in
this
case,
even
if
we
disagreed
with
you.
justice
potter
stewart
if
available.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn't
you
have
the
same
duty
under
the
labor
act?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
read
judge
damon
keith's
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
as
requiring
the
employer
to
do
what?
pay
him?
first
of
all,
pay
him?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
way
i
read
it
too.
but
it
wasn't
all
that
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly
not
to
discipline
them.
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
pay
them?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
doesn't
spell
it
out,
does
he?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it?
does
the
regulation
have
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
alternate
work
at
the
same
pay?
justice
potter
stewart
i
read
these
briefs
pretty
carefully,
and
i
came
away
with
a
good
many
unanswered
questions
in
my
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
reason
i'm
asking
you
some
of
those
questions.
do
you
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
said
that
under
this
regulation,
which
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
a
valid
regulation
under
the
statute,
that
the
employer
has
an
obligation,
a,
not
to
discipline
--
that's
certainly
clear;
b,
do
you
think
to
pay?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
not
clear,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
under
the
labor
act,
that
simply
means
you
can't
fire
him,
because
that's
a
protected
union
activity.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
mean
pay
for
not
work?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
clear,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
your
client,
after
these
two
employees
refused
to
go
on
the
screen,
did
what?
said,
you
go
home
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
there
was
a
final
refusal?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
then
a
final
refusal?
justice
potter
stewart
they
went
home
at
the
direction
of
the
employer?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
balance
of
the
shift,
and
they
didn't
get
paid
for
those
hours.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
addition
to
that,
they
were
disciplined.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
what
way?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they
weren't
docked
any
pay
for
work
they
had
done,
or
anything
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you'd
have
a
statutory
obligation
not
to
discipline.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i'm
saying,
if
you
failed
to
pay
him,
that's
not
discipline?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
discipline
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
what's
the
difference
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
if
the
solicitor
general
is
right,
all
you
had
to
do
differently
was
just
not
put
that
piece
of
paper
in
his
file.
justice
potter
stewart
just
don't
pay
him.
and
why
wouldn't
the
case
then
be
the
same,
and
then
there
isn't
this
terrible
consequence?
justice
potter
stewart
where
it
was
clearly
under
the
statute.
your
only
statutory
duty
is
not
to
discipline
him;
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
would
he
have
greater
rights
when
the
statutory
is
considerably
more
ambiguous?
and
if
it
weren't
so
ambiguous,
this
case
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
maybe
that
under
--
that
even
though
you're
wrong,
and
that
you
are
under
the
statute,
the
secretary's
regulation
is
a
correct
or
allowable
interpretation
of
the
act,
it
may
be
that
even
so
your
only
duty
was
not
to
put
that
piece
of
paper
in
his
file.
and
that's
not
at
all
clear
in
this
case,
either
from
your
brief
or
from
the
solicitor
general's.
justice
potter
stewart
or
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
discipline.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
there
might
be
a
grievance.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
earlier
told
me
just
one
man
alone
could
do
this
under
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
issue
was
what
was
in
the
minds
--
justice
potter
stewart
--of
the
employees,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
were
they
in
good
faith,
and
was
it
reasonable,
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
before
you
go
off
--
i
had
thought
that
that
wasn't
the
issue
at
all;
that
the
issue
was,
whether
or
not
the
secretary
had
any
power
at
all
to
issue
1977.12(b)(2).
justice
potter
stewart
or
whether
or
not
that
was
contrary
to
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
may
be;
may
be.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
it
an
authorized
interpretative
regulation.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
do
you
think
that
means,
protects
him
from
discrimination?
it
certainly
means,
if
you're
correct,
that
he's
protected
from
any
disciplinary
action,
being
fired
or
anything
less
than
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
does
it
mean
that
he's
entitled
to
be
paid
for
time
that
he
doesn't
work,
when
he
goes
off,
unlike
a
striker?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
these
conditions
existed.
justice
potter
stewart
but
only
under
that
sort
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
only
--
you
can't
be
treated
other
than
other
similarly
situated
employees
are
treated.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
actually,
that's
not
--
i'm
not
criticizing
you
for
making
that
argument.
but
the
issue
here
is
considerably
narrower,
isn't
it?
and
that
is,
whether
or
not
this
interpretative
regulation
is
within
the
terms
of
a
specific
part
of
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
10(c)(1).
justice
potter
stewart
29
usc
660
(c)(1)?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what's
specifically
involved,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
as
you
say,
mr.
solicitor
general,
your
brother
says
that
the
secretary
has
gone
even
beyond
his
own
regulation
in
this
particular
case.
that's
in
his
reply
brief,
and
i
think
it's
also
in
his
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
just
telling
us
that
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
i
understood
what
he
was
saying.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
on
that
suggestion,
supposing
--
i'd
like
to
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
mann
--
if
he
had
been
concerned,
and
in
the
morning
got
up
and
went
to
the
osha
office.
it
took
him
all
day
to
file
his
complaint
so
he
didn't
show
up
at
all
for
a
given
day.
and
it's
clearly
protected
by
the
statute
because
he's
making
a
complaint.
would
the
employer
have
a
statutory
duty
to
pay
him
for
that
day?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
discrimination?
he
didn't
show
up
for
work.
so
you
don't
pay
people
who
don't
work.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
discipline.
no
paper
in
the
file,
no
discharge,
no
--
nothing
hanging
over
that
--
he
came
back
the
next
day,
and
they
say,
"gee,
i'm
glad
you
called
it
to
the
inspector's
attention,
because
we'd
like
to
know
whether
they
think
it's
too
dangerous."
they're
just
as
nice
as
they
can
be
to
him.
how
could
you
say
there's
discrimination
because
they
don't
pay
him
for
a
day
he
doesn't
work?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
right
to
be
paid
--
to
be
paid
for
making
a
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
don't
see
how
that
--
that
really
answers
my
problem
about
why,
if
there's
the
same
statutory
right
in
both
of
the
hypothetical
cases,
in
one
case
you
say
he
gets
pay
and
the
other
one,
you
say
he
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
he's
protected
against
is
discipline
or
discrimination.
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
fits
the
definition
of
discrimination
or
discipline
to
say,
"i'm
not
going
to
pay
you
for
days
you
don't
work."
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
guess
i
am,
too.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
employer's
policy
with
respect
to
employees
is
to
pay
them
only
if
they
work,
then
somebody
who
goes
to
the
osha
office
or
goes
to
toledo
to
testify
is
not
entitled
to
pay,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
not
discrimination
against
him
for
exercising
his
rights
under
the
act,
his
conceded
rights
under
the
act.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
subject
to
vacation
and
sick
pay
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
it's
a
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
for
jury
duty.
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
foreman
might
say,
"this
was
your
job
on
the
shift;
go
home."
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
don't
want
to
do
this
job
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you're
correct
in
your
basic
position.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
could
disrupt
the
whole
plant,
depending
on
the
nature
of
his
job.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
if
it
were
a
matter
of
opening
the
door
so
the
employees
could
come
in,
and
he's
afraid
the
ceiling
would
fall
on
him.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
of
1970
prohibits
an
employer
from
discharging
or
discriminating
against
any
employee
who
exercises
any
right
afforded
by
the
act.
the
secretary
of
labor
has
promulgated
a
regulation
providing
that
among
the
rights
that
the
act
so
protects,
is
the
right
of
an
employee
to
choose
not
to
perform
his
assigned
job
because
of
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
death
or
serious
injury
coupled
with
a
reasonable
belief
that
no
less
drastic
alternative
is
available.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
this
regulation
is
consistent
with
the
act.
on
july
10,
1974,
two
of
the
petitioner's
maintenance
employees,
virgil
deemer
and
thomas
cornwell,
reported
for
the
night
shift
at
the
petitioner's
plant
in
marion,
ohio.
their
foreman
directed
the
two
men
to
perform
maintenance
duties
on
a
section
of
an
overhead
screen.
claiming
that
the
screen
was
unsafe,
they
refused
to
carry
out
this
directive.
the
foreman
then
sent
them
to
the
personnel
office,
where
they
were
ordered
to
punch
out
without
working
or
being
paid
for
the
remaining
six
hours
of
the
shift.
the
two
men
subsequently
received
written
reprimands,
which
were
placed
in
their
employment
files.
a
little
over
a
month
later,
the
secretary
of
labor,
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
alleging
that
the
petitioner's
actions
against
deemer
and
cornwell
constituted
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
act.
following
a
bench
trial,
the
district
court
found
that
the
regulation
in
question
justified
deemer's
and
cornwell's
refusals
to
obey
their
foreman's
order.
the
court
found
that
the
two
employees
had
refused
to
perform
the
cleaning
operation
because
of
a
genuine
fear
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm,
that
the
danger
presented
had
been
real
and
not
something
which
had
existed
only
in
the
minds
of
the
employees,
and
that
the
employees
had
acted
in
good
faith
and
that
no
reasonable
alternative
had
realistically
been
open
to
them
other
than
to
refuse
to
work.
the
district
court
nevertheless
denied
relief,
holding
that
the
secretary's
regulation
was
inconsistent
with
the
act
and
therefore
invalid.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
judgment.
finding
ample
support
in
the
record
for
the
district
court's
factual
determination
that
the
actions
of
deemer
and
cornwell,
the
employees,
had
been
justified
under
the
secretary's
regulation,
the
appellate
court
disagreed
with
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
regulation
itself
is
invalid.
it
accordingly
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
we
granted
certiorari
because
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
conflicts
with
those
of
two
other
courts
of
appeals
on
the
important
question
in
issue.
for
the
reason
set
out
in
detail
and
in
some
length
in
the
court's
written
opinion,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
