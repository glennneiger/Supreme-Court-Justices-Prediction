mr.
mann
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
in
what
respect
was
there
a
mechanical
failure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
your
position,
then?
suppose
he
employs
these
other
mechanisms.
say
he
files
with
osha,
and
says
it's
very
dangerous.
and
he
says,
until
they
do
something
about
it,
i'm
not
going
to
work.
what
is
your
right
with
respect
to
him?
could
you
suspend
him
and
dock
him
some
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
assume
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
he's
--
he's
called
them
on
the
phone,
or
written
them
a
letter,
or
something,
and
osha
says,
we'll
be
out
day
after
tomorrow.
and
he
says,
well
--
he
says
to
his
employers,
"until
these
people
come
and
inspect
and
do
something
about
this,
i'm
not
going
to
work."
and
--
what's
your
response?
could
you
fire
him
at
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
i
take
it
your
position
--
why
do
you
think
the
solicitor
general
mischaracterizes
your
position,
then,
in
their
brief?
because
i
thought
i
asked
you
whether
he
was
free
not
to
work
while
he's
waiting
for
osha.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
only
issue
really
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is
whether
one
employee
acting
independently
can
refuse
to
work.
if
he
gets
a
few
co-workers
to
agree
with
him,
and
they
agree
they're
going
to
sacrifice
pay
for
the
period
they
don't
work,
that's
the
whole
fight
here,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
isn't
the
only
question
here
is
whether
there
--
there
are
two
ways
to
--
i
mean,
whether
he
has
an
additional
protection
for
the
same
right
that
the
labor
act
already
protects?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
didn't
try
to
fire
him,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
put
a
citation
in
his
file,
and
you
didn't
give
him
another
thing
to
do
during
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
all
we
said
was,
take
the
citation
out
of
his
file,
and
you
don't
have
to
pay
him,
then
there
isn't
much
of
a
fight
here
as
i
see
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
that
mean
pay
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
while
not
working?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
we
say
that's
all
he
did
here,
then
the
consequence
is
the
same.
he
--
these
two
people
are
not
presenting
themselves
for
work
when
they
say
it's
too
dangerous
for
us
to
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
wouldn't
even
be
true
if
he
were
at
the
osha
office,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
--
whether
you
could
fire
him
or
not
is
the
same
question
as
to
whether
you
can
put
the
piece
of
paper
in
his
file.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
any
form.
so
it's
just
not
a
piece
of
paper.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you've
conceded
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
prevent
you
from
firing
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
what
he
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
a
similar
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
probe
a
little
bit
about
what
kind
of
similarity
we're
talking
about?
are
you
saying
that
if,
in
a
given
plant,
an
employee
comes
in,
and
it's
manifestly
terribly
dangerous
for
him
to
work,
and
he
says,
"i
don't
want
to
work
until
this
is
corrected,"
and
the
company
says,
"okay,
you
don't
have
to
work,
and
you'll
be
paid,"
is
it
then
similar
if
the
next
day
there's
another
situation
in
which
there
is--not
nearly
as
clear
that
it's
dangerous;
it's
an
entirely
different
part
of
the
plant
and
all
the
rest;
and
the
supervisor
says,
"i
don't
agree
with
you;
i
think
you
should
work."
he
refuses.
and
the
company
does
not
pay
him.
and
he
comes
in
and
says,
"well,
you
paid
the
other
man."
they
say,
"well,
that
was
much
more
dangerous,
and
we
agreed
with
you
there,
but
we
don't
agree
with
you
here."
does
he
have
to
pay
--
in
other
words,
does
the
company
set
a
precedent
that
it
must
always
pay
everytime
it
agrees
to
pay
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
take
that
position,
that
he's
entitled
to
be
paid
that
day,
and
you
also
say
he
has
a
right
just
not
to
work
for
a
day
because
it's
too
dangerous,
equally
he
ought
to
be
paid
for
that
day.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me,
you
are
arguing
for
a
right
to
strike
without--with
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
a
statutory
right
to
do
that,
but
you're
arguing
there's
a
statutory
right
to
sit
down,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there's
no
alternate
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
agree,
he's
protected
in
both
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether
the
--
when
the
employer
doesn't
pay,
why
is
it
discrimination
in
one
case
and
not
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
protected
in
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
single,
even-handed
policy
of
the
employer
is
simply
not
to
pay
people
if
they
don't
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
way
i
understood
the
--
i
though
that
was
one
of
the
issues
between
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
think
now,
having
listened
to
your
colleague
and
having
said
what
you're
said,
that
you
are
in
agreement
on
pay,
at
least
with
respect
to
non-waiting
time
in
osha
office?
if
he
just
says,
"i'm
going
home
today."
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
soon
as
he
reaches
the
floor,
then,
he
has
removed
himself
from
the
danger
of
harm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
doesn't
he
get
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
man
who
went
to
the
osha
office
and
had
to
kill
the
day
because
it
took
the
whole
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
one
case,
the
employee
doesn't
work
because
the
employer
doesn't
have
work
that,
in
effect,
was
promised
to
him;
he
promises
him
a
machine
to
work
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
other
two
cases
--
both
the
office
case
and
the
dangerous
case
--
the
employee
isn't
working
because
he's
exercising
what
you
describe
as
a
statutory
right.
and
then
you're
saying,
one
statutory
right
has
--
even
though
it's
the
same
one
sentence
in
the
statute
--
the
remedy
differs
in
the
two
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
be
right.
i'll
reflect
on
it,
certainly,
because
i
have
the
same
regard
for
your
views
as
you
so
kindly
express
with
respect
to
mine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
it
all
goes
back
to
the
question
of
how
much
weight
we
are
to
give
to
the
congressional
--
a
very
strong
evidence
of
congressional
intent
on
the
strike-with-pay
provision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
i
understood
judge
keith
--
and
i
may
have
misread
him,
because
i
think
parts
of
it
are
hard
to
understand
--
he,
in
effect,
was
saying,
all
of
that
is
inapplicable,
because
there's
no
requirement
of
pay
here.
now,
if
you
decide
there
is
a
pay
provision,
then
the
legislative
history,
which
was
persuasive
to
the
fifth
circuit,
becomes
much
more
significant.
and
i
think
it
all
helps
us
focus
on
how
much
weight
we
give
to
the
legislative
history
which
judge
keith
discounted
and
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on.
and
that's
why
i
make
such
a
point
of
it.
