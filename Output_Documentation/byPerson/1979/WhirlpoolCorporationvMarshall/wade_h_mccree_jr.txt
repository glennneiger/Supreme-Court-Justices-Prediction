mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question,
whether
section
11(c)(1)
of
osha,
as
interpreted
by
the
secretary
of
labor
in
29
cfr
1977.12(b)(2)
prohibits
an
employer
from
retaliating
against
an
employee
who
refuses
to
perform
particular
assigned
tasks
when
the
following
conditions
exist.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
that
may
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
that
may
be
another
way
of
expressing
the
same
thought.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
clearly,
this
is
an
interpretative
regulation;
it's
not
a
legislative
regulation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
the
question
is,
does
the
statute
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
precisely.
does
the
statute
afford
a
worker
the
right
that
the
secretary
delineated
in
this
carefully
drawn
interpretative
regulation.
and
this
regulation
provides
that
he
may
not
be
discriminated
against
if
he
refuses
to
perform
a
particular
assigned
task
when
the
following
conditions
occur
first,
in
good
faith;
second,
he
concludes
that
there
is
a
real
danger
of
death
or
serious
injury
confronting
him;
three,
under
circumstances
that
a
reasonable
person
would
so
conclude;
four,
and
the
urgency
of
the
situation
afforded
insufficient
time
to
eliminate
the
danger
through
resort
to
the
regular
statutory
enforcement
channels;
five,
he
also
sought
if
possible
from
his
employer,
but
without
success,
a
correction
of
the
dangerous
condition;
and
six,
he
had
no
reasonable
alternative.
we
suggest
that
under
that
very
narrow
concurrence
of
circumstances
that
the
act,
by
necessary
implication,
affords
this
right
to
the
employee,
which
under
section
11(c)(1),
which
is
the
anti-discrimination
provision
of
the
statute,
protects
him
from
discrimination
on
the
part
of
his
employer.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
that's
clear.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
entitles
him
to
pay
unless,
in
an
almost
equivalent
situation,
another
employee
would
be
entitled
to
pay.
i
interpret
discrimination
to
mean
to
treat
him
differently
from
the
way
someone
else--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--in
an
almost
similar
situation
would
be
following.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
for
example,
suppose
he
agreed
--
suppose
an
employee
recognized
an
situation
as
presenting
an
imminent
risk
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm,
and
objectively
it
existed
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--and
he
believed
it
in
good
faith,
and
so
forth.
except,
the
only
difference
being,
the
foreman
agreed
with
him.
the
foreman
said,
"you're
right.
you
don't
have
to
work
until
we
correct
that."
now,
if
that
employee
received
pay
while
the
matter
was
being
corrected,
then
i
would
think
this
employee
would
be
entitled
to
pay.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
under
that
kind
of
situation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
i
said,
almost
similarly
situated,
because
there
is
this
one
minor
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
if
he--if
it
were
an
economic
strike,
or
something
of
that
sort,
certainly
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
pay.
but
he
would
have
to
be
treated
as
another
employee
would.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
i
would
think
the
company
reserves
its
right
to
make
a
distinction
between
situations.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
the
test
would
be
this
if
a
company
refused
to
pay
on
your
second
day
situation
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
then
the
employee
under
the
statute
would
have
to
ask
the
secretary
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
to
bring
an
action
for
him
to
relieve
him
of
the
consequences
of
the
discrimination,
if
it
was
discrimination.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
would
hope
the
secretary
would
make
--
would
discriminate,
too,
and
would
look
carefully
and
decide
whether
to
bring
this.
and
if
the
secretary
ultimately
decided
to
bring
it,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
secretary
to
prove
that
the
employee's
refusal
to
work
was
within
the
narrow
circumstances
in
the
interpretative
regulation
that
the
secretary
established.
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
the
entire
structure
of
the
statute
requires
us
to
infer
such
a
right,
because
the
statute
to
begin
with,
looked
at
as
a
whole,
is
prophylactic
and
not
compensatory.
it
begins
with
the
purpose
stated
of
affording
every
man
and
woman
in
the
workforce
a
safe
place
to
work,
and
it
isn't
couched
in
terms
of
recompensing
him
after
an
accident
has
happened.
and
we
suggest
that
a
statute
that
has
that
general
design
must
necessarily
permit
him
to
refuse
to
work
where
his
life
is
imperilled,
or
where
he's
subjected
to
serious
imminent
bodily
harm.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
it's
not
explicit.
it's
implicit.
we
must
argue
that
it's
implicit
in
the
language
the
congress
employed.
but
when
the
language
is
read
as
a
whole
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
it's
a
necessary
part
of
the
statute.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
i
quarrel
with
my
brother,
mr.
mann,
in
this
respect.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
two
employees
here
coming
within
the
narrow
strictures
of
this
described
right.
i
think,
and
there's
no
question
about
it
as
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
district
court
found
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
be
free
from
discrimination
but
for
the
fact,
as
the
district
court
determined,
the
statute
didn't
afford
him
that
right.
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
ample
support
for
that
finding,
and
expressly
adopted
the
--
or
confirmed
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
and
so
this
court
has
at
this
point
the
pure
legal
question
of
statutory
interpretation
does
osha
afford
a
narrowly
--
this
narrowly
described
right?
and
we
suggest
it
is
--
in
our
brief--as
we
look
at
the
several
provisions
of
the
statute,
that
it
must
necessarily
must
have
intended
this
to
be.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
i
don't
understand
his
assertion
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
that
he's
gone
beyond
it.
i
don't
know
in
what
respect
he
contends
he's
gone
beyond
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
--
well,
i
read
his
brief
as
saying
the
same
thing,
but
i
don't
know
in
what
respect
he
does.
because
the
court
found
all
of
these
elements
there.
and
certainly
there
isn't
any
question
about
the
ample
evidentiary
support
for
it.
i
was
very
much
interested
in
the
physical
attributes
of
this
plant.
there
are
some
not
very
revealing
photographs
unfortunately;
they're
part
of
the
record.
i
think
if
the
court
would
like
to
see
those
in
the
record,
it
could
see
visually
this
artificial
floor
made
of
mesh,
and
it
could
see,
indeed,
that
the
june
28th
fatal
plunge
isn't
very
difficult
to
imagine,
nor
is
it
difficult
to
credit
the
employees
with
good
faith
and
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
danger,
to
walk
across
that
mesh.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
we'd
have
to
work
out
some
rule
of
reason.
he
certainly
cannot
remain
home
and
expect
to
be
paid.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
again,
i
say,
we'd
have
to
see
what
would
happen
if
the
foreman
had
agreed
with
him.
if
the
foreman
had
agreed
with
him
and
said,
"all
right,
you
go
home
and
show
up
tomorrow
morning,"
then
this
man,
too,
would
have
the
duty
--
who
unilaterally
decided
the
risk
was
something
he
shouldn't
endure.
he'd
have
to
show
up
the
next
day.
and
if
they
could
find
him
alternative
work,
he
would
have
to
perform
that,
unless
it
would
violate
the
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
if
he
--
if
the
plant
--
another
analogy
suggests
itself.
suppose
the
machinery
broke
down
at
the
plant.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
nobody
could
work.
well,
they
don't
pay
under
those
circumstances
either.
and
so
this
is
not
a
strike-with-pay
situation
at
all.
the
very
narrowly
drawn
right
that
the
secretary
recognized
in
this
regulation
was
just
to
prevent
a
tragedy
from
occurring,
and
to
allow
the
regular
procedures
of
osha
to
run
their
normal
course.
we
would
expect
him
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
he
might,
because
this
is
--
and
he
might.
this
is
an
express
right
that's
given.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
but
the
statute
here
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
because
this
is
an
express
right
that's
given
him
under
the
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
in
other
words,
it's
a
right
to
file
complaints
and
to
initiate
the
statutory
machinery
for
investigation
and
remedying
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
really
don't
think
so.
and
i
think
the
two
situations
are
distinguishable
in
this
fashion.
the
statute
encourages
the
filing
of
a
report,
and
bringing
into
operating--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
all
right.
but
he
may
have
to
spend
all
day
to
get
the
attention
of
the
osha
inspector.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
he
doesn't
have
to
remain
all
day
to
get
down
off
that
mesh.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
once
he's
down
from
that
mesh,
and
he's
no
longer
in
a
place
of
peril,
then
he's
subject
to
the
orders
of
the
foreman
at
the
workplace.
the
foreman
can
put
him
on
another
job.
these
are
maintenance
people
in
this
case,
and
it
was
estimated
that
they
spent
about
15
hours
a
week
--
i
take
it
that's
out
of
a
40-hour
week
--
working
on
this
overhead
mesh,
retrieving
stock
that
fell
from
the
conveyor
belt,
and
getting
rid
of
dripping
oil.
and
the
other
portion
of
the
40-hour
week,
the
other
35
hours
were
spent
--
or
25
hours,
i
guess
--
were
spent
in
other
maintenance
tasks.
so
as
soon
as
he
got
down
from
the
place
of
peril,
then
it
would
seem
that
the
authority
of
the
foreman
would
he
reestablished.
whereas,
the
worker
who
had
gone
out
to
the
osha
office,
and
had
to
sit
in
the
waiting
room,
he
couldn't
do
anything
until
he
reached
the
osha
inspector.
after
that,
he
would
have
a
duty
to
come
back.
in
marshall
v.
barlow's,
inc.
in
the
--
i
think
the
dissenting
opinion
authored
by
your
honor,
the
statement
of
the
--
the
quotation
appears,
"the
number
of
inspections
which
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
made
will
undoubtedly,
for
an
unforseeable
period,
exceed
the
capacity
of
the
inspection
force."
that
was
footnote
6
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
and
i
think
that
that
suggests
that
there
might
--
require
some
additional
time
to
be
spent
in
the
waiting
room.
and
that's
the
way
i
would
try
to
distinguish
those
cases.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
because
--
because
the
exercise
of
the
right
will
take
longer
in
one
case
than
it
will
in
the
other.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he's
protected
while
he
exercises
the
right.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
know
i'm
repeating
myself
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
but
my
best
answer
is,
that
he's
protected
while
he
does
what
the
statute
gives
him
permission
to
do.
he's
not
protected
against
discrimination
after
that
time.
as
soon
as
he's
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
made
the
report,
he
has
to
come
back.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
i
suppose
a
further
answer
is,
in
order
to
vindicate
the
right
to
be
free
from
discrimination,
he's
going
to
have
to
ask
the
secretary
to
bring
an
action
for
him.
and
maybe
this
is
one
of
those
instances
where,
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
some
of
these
lacunae
in
the
statutory
scheme
are
just
going
to
have
to
be
worked
out.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
he
may
not
be.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
if
he
tries
to
extend
it
beyond
what
the
statute
--
the
authorization
of
the
statute
gives
him,
then
he
is
not
entitled
to
pay;
of
that
i'm
certain.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
may
not
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
may
very
well
be
the
resolution
that
a
court
would
make.
but
i
suggest
that's
not
before
us.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
say
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
say,
it
is
a
logical--a
logical
distinction.
if
i
may
shift
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--into
another
area,
we
speak
about
citizens
performing
their
civic
duty.
some
states
have
statutes
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--that
require
payment--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--for
jury
duty.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
this
statute
may,
by
implication,
do
that.
and
i'm
not
prepared
--
that's
not
before
us
in
any
event
today;
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
in
a
sense.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
keith;
judge
keith.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
certain
--
and
i
would
like
to
look
at
his
opinion
more
carefully.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
on
that,
i
agree,
he
is
not
entitled
to
pay.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
so;
i
think
we
are.
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
be
treated
no
differently
from
any
other
employee
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
i
have
to
say,
i'm
not
certain
that
that
would
be
so
if
he
exercised
one
of
the
rights
expressly
given
him
under
the
statute.
the
congress
may
have
intended
that.
it
would
seem
quite
consistent
with
a
policy
to
encourage
reports,
to
promote
safety,
to
make
it
possible--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
have
failed
to
communicate
a
distinction
that
appears
valid
to
me.
and
it
apparently
has
some
infirmities,
because
it
doesn't
appear
valid
to
you.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
to
refuse
work
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
is
exercised
in
a
short
period
of
time.
he
just
says,
"i'm
getting
down
from
this
mesh
before
i
fall
through
to
my
death."
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
he
is
subject
then
to
the
foreman's
instruction
"well,
all
right,
get
a
broom,
you're
a
maintenance
person,
and
sweep
the
floor."
"get
a
mop,
clean
up
the
oil."
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
that's
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
would
analogize
him
more
to
the
person
whose
machine
broke
down.
and
if
his
--
if
the
machine
broke
down,
and
there
wasn't
anything
else
to
do
because
everybody
else
was
working
on
every
available
machine,
and
they
said,
"you
have
to
go
home."
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
perhaps
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
i
would
like
to
suggest
in
any
event
that
this
isn't
before
us
at
this
time
for
a
decision.
because
if
this
court
decides
that
there
is
a
right,
as
described
by
the
secretary
in
the
challenged
interpretative
regulation,
that's
what
this
lawsuit
is
about.
now,
what
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
should
the
consequences
be
because
his
employer
didn't
recognize
it,
is
another
matter.
and
it
wasn't
challenged
in
this
case.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
think
i
must
conclude
that
it's
always
easier
to
state
a
proposition
than
to
apply
it.
and
the
proposition,
i
think,
we
agree
on
that
he
shouldn't
be
treated
differently
from
another
person
under
the
same
circumstance.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
right.
and
the
difficulties
result
from
trying
to
do
this.
i
would
like
to
suggest
some
--
i'm
not
certain
of
my
time
here
--
that
to
imply,
or
to
find
that
the
statute
implies
this
very
narrow
right
is
entirely
consistent
with
all
of
its
provisions,
and
that
my
brother's
reference
to
legislative
history
as
negativing
such
a
right
is
misplaced.
the
two
bits
of
legislative
history
to
which
he
makes
reference
are,
the
one
pertaining
to
strike-with-pay,
and
the
other
pertaining
to
shutting
down
a
plant.
and
in
our
brief
we
distinguish
them,
i
believe
successfully,
by
pointing
out
that
the
strike
with
pay
provision
applied
not
to
imminent
danger,
but
applied
to
a
section
of
the
statute
which
required
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
develop
a
schedule
of
toxic
substances,
exposure
to
which
created
an
impermissible
hazard;
and
that
after
the
secretary
promulgated
this
list
--
in
fact,
six
months
after
that
--
an
employee
could
then
leave
his
workplace,
and
not
return
until
certain
protective
measures
were
adopted,
including
protective
clothing
and
certain
kinds
of
notices
and
so
forth.
this
is
the
provision
that
was
in
the
daniels
bill
that
was
rejected
utterly
by
the
congress.
but
we
submit
that
this
was
not
at
all
related
to
the
question
of
immediate,
imminent
danger
to
life
and
limb;
and
therefore,
the
fact
that
that
was
rejected
doesn't
mean
that
the
congress
meant
to
reject
the
ultra-hazardous
situation
that
happened
under
these
narrow
circumstances.
the
other
legislative
history
related
to
the
right
that
would
be
given
an
inspector
for
a
short
period
of
time
to
shut
down
a
plant
or
an
operation,
and
this
was
similarly
rejected
when
it
appeared
in
the
senate
bill.
and
we
suggest
the
right
that
we
believe
the
statute
implies,
as
described
in
the
regulations,
doesn't
shut
down
a
plant
or
an
operation,
unless
it's
just
a
one-person
plant;
it
just
means
that
the
employee
who
is
confronted
with
imminent
danger
to
life
or
limb
may,
to
save
his
own
life,
or
to
spare
him
the
cruel
dilemma
of
choosing
between
his
job
and
his
health,
might
discontinue,
and
be
free
from
discrimination.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
could.
but
it's
not
the
same
as
the
inspector
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
we
think,
of
course,
the
two
cases
are
distinguished
--
i
see
my
time
is
expired.
thank
you.
