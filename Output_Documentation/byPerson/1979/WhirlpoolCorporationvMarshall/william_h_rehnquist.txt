mr.
mann,
the
act
does
give
the
secretary
the
authority
to
promulgate
and
enforce
standards
to
eliminate
hazards,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
rulemaking
notice
and
comment
in
connection
with
this
interpretative
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
a
swift
against
wickham-type
inquiry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you,
that
the
secretary
could
perhaps
go
further,
had
he
promulgated
regulations
as
the
statute
authorizes
him
to
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
assume
the
employer
says,
look,
i'm
not
firing
you
for
filing
the
complaint
at
all;
i'm
firing
you
for
refusing
to
work
while
--
during
the
period
that
--
while
you're
waiting
for
osha
to
come.
could
you
fire
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
they
give
up
there
--
they
don't
get
paid
when
they
do
it.
i
mean,
that's
a
sort
of
a
deterrent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
did
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
most
collective
bargaining
contracts
call
for
some
provision
for
sick
leave?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
man
simply
failed
to
show
up
because
he
was
hung
over
for
the
period
of
time
that
this
man
was
--
refused
to
work?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no;
he
was
sick.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wouldn't
be
a
form
of
discipline,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
what's
the
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
right,
that's
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
similarity
is
limited
to
osha-type
situations,
when
you're
talking
about
discriminating.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
general
mccree,
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
not
only
in
his
trip
to
the
osha
office,
but
perhaps
in
the
two
or
three
days
he
spends
testifying
in
the
district
court
in
toledo,
he's
also
entitled
to
be
paid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
the
logical
resolution
for
any
court
to
make?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
