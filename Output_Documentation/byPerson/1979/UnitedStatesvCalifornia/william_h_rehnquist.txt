the
santa
barbara
biltmore
pier
was
never
used
for
navigation,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
just
dock
at
the
pier,
so
to
speak?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
just
not
used
that
way
anymore?
they
were
built
for
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
the
special
master,
he
found
that
some
of
these
piers
were
ports
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
but
he
found
that
none
of
them
were
part
of
a
harbor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
use
the
word
"port"
do
you
simply
mean
a
place
that
a
ship
could
pull
up
to
and
unload?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
isn't
necessarily
a
sheltered
place
from
the
tides
or
weather?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
had
a
pier
built
of
solid
wood
pilings,
not
pilings
or
posts
every
20
feet
but
simply
solid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
like
a
cement
pier
that
went
right
out
