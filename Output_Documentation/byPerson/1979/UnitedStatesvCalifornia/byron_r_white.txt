but
it
goes
out
and
if
a
pier
went
out
out
in
exactly
the

direction,
you
would
say
it
is
not

did
not
extend

mr.
shapiro,
i
just
missed
it.
could
you
give
me
again
the
french
word
for
a
pier
that
is
open
underneath?

i

but
we
have
in
our
cases
turned
to
the
convention,
haven't
we?
justice

and
the
question
arises
what
do
some
of
the
words
mean
in
the
convention
to
which
we
have
turned
for
guidance.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
people
who
negotiated
and
signed
that
convention
and
used
those
words
perhaps
have
some
notion
about
what
they
meant.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree.
but
nevertheless
you
can't
say
that
the
parties
who
negotiated
those
words,
that
their
views
are
entitled
to
no
weight
at
all.
