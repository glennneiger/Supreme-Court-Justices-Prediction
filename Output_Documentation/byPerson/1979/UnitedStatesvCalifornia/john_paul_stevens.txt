could
i
just
interrupt
for
a
second.
you
are
talking
about
1955
history
of
the
convention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
help
us
understand
the
meaning
of
a
statute
congress
enacted
in
1953.
justice

if
there
is
an
anomaly
it
was
created
by
this
court,
rather
than
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
this
is
just
a
line.
it
is
a
line,
it
is
not
a
complete
circle.
it
just
goes
out
in
a
slant
from
the
coastline.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
isn't
perfectly
perpendicular.
it
is
on
a
45
[degree]
angle
with
the
coastline,
say,
and
between
it
is
an
expanding
area
of
rather
quiet
water
on
the
way
out,
behind
it.
