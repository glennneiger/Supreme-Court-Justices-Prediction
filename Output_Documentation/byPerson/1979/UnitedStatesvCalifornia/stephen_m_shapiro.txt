mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
contends
that
california's
open
pile
piers
and
the
elevated
punta
gorda
causeway
do
not
enlarge
the
state's
coastline
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
support
of
this
contention,
we
rely
on
the
text
of
the
act,
articles
3
and
8
of
the
geneva
convention
and
this
court's
decisions
establishing
which
structures
do
and
which
do
not
extend
the
coastline.
before
turning
to
the
special
rule
which
applies
to
harbor
works,
i
would
like
to
summarize
the
general
rule.
the
generally
applicable
base
point
for
measuring
the
territorial
sea
of
a
coastal
state
is
the
low
tide
line
running
along
the
shore.
this
is
the
rule
which
is
prescribed
in
the
act,
which
states
that
the
term
"coastline"
means
the
line
of
ordinary
low
water
along
that
portion
of
the
coast
which
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea.
the
same
standard
appears
in
article
3
of
the
geneva
convention,
as
this
court
recognized
in
its
second
decision
in
this
litigation.
applying
that
traditional
rule
to
the
california
shoreline
is
not
difficult.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
pacific
ocean
at
low
tide
runs
right
under
the
legs
of
these
piers
and
reaches
the
shore
without
interruption
of
any
kind.
it
leaves
the
low
tide
line
on
the
beach
precisely
where
it
would
have
been
if
these
piers
had
never
been
erected.
in
short,
the
piers
have
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
natural
low
water
line
along
the
shore.
in
the
words
of
the
special
master,
water
flows
freely
underneath
all
of
the
piers.
they
have
no
visible
effect
on
the
shoreline.
this
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
structures
such
as
concrete
jetties
or
landfills
or
gravel
banks
or
groins
which
push
back
the
sea
by
extending
the
land
domain.
this
court
used
those
very
terms
in
describing
the
structures
which
it
included
as
proper
base
points
in
its
second
decision
in
this
litigation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
quite
true,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
these
piers
have
no
such
function.
they
rest
on
open
pilings
that
are
between
16
and
60
feet
apart
and
the
water
rushes
right
under
these
piers
and
right
through
the
pilings
without
any
interruption.
there
is
no
impact
at
all
on
hydrographic
conditions,
that
is
the
waves
or
the
undercurrents
of
the
ocean.
it
leaves
the
ocean
precisely
as
it
would
have
been
if
they
had
never
been
erected.california
nonetheless
argues
that
even
though
the
tide
rushes
right
under
these
piers
to
the
beach,
the
low
water
line
should
be
traced
along
the
outer
perimeter
of
the
piers.
under
that
theory,
the
low
water
line
skips
from
post
to
post
until
it
reaches
the
end
of
the
pier
which
may
be
as
much
as
a
half
mile
seaward,
and
the
posts
are
between
16
and
60
feet
apart.
this
we
submit
is
not
a
low
water
line
at
all,
it
is
just
a
series
of
posts
that
are
completely
surrounded
by
water.
if
these
posts
standing
in
the
water
make
up
a
low
water
line,
then
so
too
does
any
string
of
artificial
islands,
which
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
ruling
in
the
louisiana
case,
that
an
artificial
structure
completely
surrounded
by
water
does
not
extend
the
coastline.
and
it
makes
no
difference
we
submit
under
article
3
that
the
posts
in
the
water
have
a
platform
on
top.
that
platform
has
no
contact
at
all
with
the
water.
it
is
between
20
and
30
feet
above
the
water
at
low
tide.
clearly,
the
platform
does
not
push
back
the
ocean
or
have
any
conjunction
with
the
ordinary
line
of
low
water
along
the
coast.
and
under
the
express
terms
of
the
act,
there
is
no
way
that
the
elevated
platform
can
be
that
line
along
the
coast
which
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
would
be
an
article
3
structure
if
it
were
attached
to
the
shore
and
it
were
a
solid
structure
extending
into
the
water.
this
court
has
treated
that
kind
of
a
structure
as
an
article
3
structure.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
correct,
for
the
simple
reason
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
pier
could
not
extend
the
base
line
and
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
breakwater
could,
and
this
is
the
common
sense
of
that
distinction.
the
pier
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
pier
doesn't
displace
the
low
water
mark.
the
lower
water
line
is
on
the
beach
precisely
where
it
would
have
been.
it
starts
at
one
end
of
the
beach
and
runs
right
under
the
pier
and
continues
on
on
the
other
side
of
the
pier.
but
when
you
have
a
solid
structure,
there
is
only
one
low
water
line.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
you
don't,
your
honor,
behind
a
solid
peninsula
that
extends
into
the
ocean.
there
is
only
a
low
water
line
around
the
peninsular,
not
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
if
it
is
perpendicular
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that
structure
could
well
be
an
article
8
harbor
structure,
but
it
would
also
in
our
view
be
an
article
3
structure
because
it
displaces
the
water
for
its
whole
extent,
and
the
very
tip
of
it
would
be
--
you
could
trace
low
water
line
around
the
whole
of
this
structure
and
that,
after
all,
is
the
standard
that
is
contained
in
article
3
and
in
the
statute,
where
is
the
low
water
line,
does
it
follow
the
structure
or
does
it
flow
under
the
structure,
and
in
this
case
it
goes
right
under
the
structure
without
hindrance.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
a
solid
wooden
structure,
assuming
it
could
be
constructed
and
stay
up
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
structure
would
be
an
article
3
structure,
there
would
be
no
question
that
that
structure
would
displace
the
water
with
solid
land
and
would
displace
the
low
water
line
at
the
tip
of
that
structure.
you
could
trace
it
continuously
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
is
an
article
3
structure.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
does
indeed.
it
does
indeed
and
the
reason
is
that
article
3
asks
the
question
where
is
the
low
water
line.
that
is
the
base
point
for
delimiting
the
territorial
sea.
before
turning
to
article
8
of
the
convention,
i
would
like
to
respond
briefly
to
two
of
california's
arguments
about
article
3.
california
says
that
the
posts
that
support
the
pier
form
a
substantially
continuous
surface
similar
to
the
example
that
was
given
of
a
wooden
structure
and
that
in
fact
they
are
similar
to
the
rocks
piled
up
in
a
jetty,
they
make
up
an
almost
continuous
wall.
this
we
submit
is
a
misstatement
of
the
case
because
the
pilings
in
the
pier
are
between
16
and
60
feet
apart.
between
90
and
98
percent
of
the
underside
of
this
pier
is
completely
void,
as
the
special
master
specifically
found.
there
is
no
way
to
characterize
the
space
as
de
minimis
gaps
between
a
substantially
solid
wall
of
rock
or
cement.
these
are
open
pile
piers
through
which
the
ocean
rushes,
as
the
special
master
described.
california
also
says
that
the
low
water
line
should
extend
to
the
tip
of
these
piers
because
official
charts
show
the
low
water
line
and
the
piers
using
the
same
black
mark.
but
the
maps
don't
suggest
that
the
low
water
line
runs
around
the
piers.
these
maps
that
california
is
referring
to
depict
the
scene
on
such
a
small
scale
that
there
is
inadequate
space
to
distinguish
between
different
features.
the
high
water
mark,
the
low
water
mark,
piers,
jetties,
rivers,
meridian
lines
are
all
delineated
with
the
same
symbols.
but
if
one
looks
to
large
scale
official
national
ocean
survey
maps,
the
distinctions
are
clear,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
plaintiff's
exhibit
20
and
defendant's
exhibits
ff,
pp,
and
ee
which
show
that
a
green
dotted
line
is
used
to
show
the
low
water
line
and
it
runs
right
under
these
piers,
just
as
the
low
water
line
runs
right
under
these
piers
in
the
real
world,
and
there
is
no
indication
in
these
large-scale
maps
that
article
3
refers
to
that
the
low
water
line
is
traced
around
the
perimeter
of
the
piers.
i
should
add
that
no
official
government
document
has
ever
suggested
that
open
pile
piers
extend
the
coastline.
the
pearcy
articles
that
are
cited
by
california
do
state
that
some
piers
enlarge
the
coastline
but
the
author
was
talking
about
solid
structure
of
the
kind
described
by
mr.
justice
white,
not
about
open
pile
piers.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
those
are
article
3
structures.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
article
3
structures
are
solid
land
masses
that
displace
the
low
water
line.
they
extend
the
land
domain
by
pushing
back
the
sea,
in
the
words
of
this
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
would
be
a
perfect
example
of
an
article
3
structure,
any
solid
mass
that
begins
on
the
land
and
continues
into
the
water
and
pushes
back
the
water,
changes
the
location
of
the
low
water
line,
would
be
an
article
3
structure.
because
these
piers
do
not
fit
comfortably
with
an
article
3,
california
of
course
places
its
principal
reliance
on
article
8
which
states
that
the
outer-most
permanent
harbor
works
which
form
an
integral
part
of
the
harbor
system
shall
be
regarded
as
forming
part
of
the
coast.
on
its
face,
this
provision
offers
no
more
support
for
california
than
article
3.
as
this
court
held
in
the
louisiana
case,
harbor
works
are
structures
which
in
some
sense
enclose
and
shelter
the
waters
within.
it
is
undisputed
that
these
open
pile
piers
do
not
enclose
or
shelter
any
water.
as
the
special
master
specifically
found,
none
of
the
piers
in
question
is
part
of
the
harbor
or
harbor
system
because
none
of
the
piers
provides
an
anchorage
sheltered
from
weather
conditions
on
the
open
sea.
now,
even
though
these
piers
do
not
serve
as
harbor
works,
california
claims
that
they
should
be
treated
the
same
way
because
there
is
little
need
for
harbors
in
california
and
because
piers
have
an
equivalent
function.
these
assertions,
however,
are
factually
unfounded.california
has
many
real
harbors
which
fall
within
the
scope
of
article
8.
the
great
natural
harbors
of
san
francisco
and
monterey
and
san
diego
are
examples,
and
i
would
also
refer
the
court
to
the
special
master's
report,
pages
44,
47,
and
48,
which
clearly
depict
artificial
harbors
within
just
a
few
miles
distance
of
some
of
these
very
same
piers
that
are
on
the
southern
california
coast.
those
harbors
serve
an
important
protective
function
during
winter
months
when
california's
coast
is
buffeted
by
storms.
nor
is
the
state
in
our
view
justified
in
applying
the
term
"port"
to
these
piers.
the
literal
meaning
of
the
word
"port"
is
a
sheltered
haven,
it
comes
from
the
latin
word
portas
which
means
a
sheltered
harbor.
it
doesn't
mean
just
a
place
where
boats
tie
up
and
discharge
cargo.
and
as
the
first
comment
to
article
8
makes
perfectly
clear,
the
port
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
five
of
them
are
used
and
tied
up
regularly
for
exchanging
passengers
and
cargo.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
dictionary
defines
the
word
differently
and
it
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
word
"harbor"
is
used
in
the
english
version
and
"port"
appears
in
the
french
version.
but
if
this
word
is
looked
up
in
the
french
dictionary,
the
same
word
is
used
for
harbor
and
port
in
french.
there
is
one
word.
and
as
the
first
comment
to
this
article
makes
perfectly
clear,
the
kind
of
structures
that
enclose
article
8
is
concerned
with
are
structures
that
enclose
or
shelter
the
waters,
that
create
inland
waters,
not
simply
platforms
that
jut
from
the
land
into
the
sea.
so
our
interpretation
of
the
word
harbor
and
port
not
only
is
consistent
with
this
court's
louisiana
decision
but
also
with
the
very
first
comment
to
article
8
which
talks
about
the
kind
of
structures
that
article
8
deals
with.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
precisely.
precisely,
or
any
pipeline
that
ran
into
the
water.
one
of
these
piers
is
nothing
but
a
system
of
two
pipes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
precisely.
california's
view
that
the
word
"port"
can
be
defined
under
article
8
as
a
place
where
boats
load
and
anchor
and
unload
is
inconsistent
with
the
geneva
convention
in
a
number
of
respects.
under
article
9,
roadsteads,
which
are
defined
as
places
normally
used
for
loading
and
unloading
ships
and
for
anchoring
ships,
are
not
ports
and
they
are
not
base
points,
even
though
they
meet
this
definition
of
port
that
california
has
provided.
roadsteads,
of
course,
are
just
places
in
the
open
sea
where
boats
lay
down
their
anchors
and
transfer
their
cargoes
to
vessels
heading
shoreward,
and
the
same
is
true
of
artificial
islands.
artificial
islands
are
often
used
for
anchoring
and
for
exchanging
passengers
and
cargoes,
but
they
are
not
base
points,
they
are
not
ports
and
they
do
not
enlarge
the
territorial
sea.
california,
of
course
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
correct,
but
california's
view
of
a
port
is
any
place
where
boats
anchor
and
load
and
unload,
in
our
view
is
over-broad
because
it
would
embrace
many
structures
totally
unconnected
with
land
or
structures
that
are
nothing
but
pipes
that
run
from
the
land
undersea
out
to
a
deep
water
anchorage
where
boats
can
pump
petroleum.
under
california's
view,
that
would
extend
the
coastline.
the
state
nonetheless
argues,
of
course,
that
its
pier
should
be
assimilated
to
harbor
works
because
they
are
similar
to
coast
protective
works
or
jetties
as
referred
to
in
the
second
comment
to
article
8.
but
they
are
clearly
not
coast
protective
works,
as
the
special
master
specifically
found,
and
they
are
not
jetties
within
the
meaning
of
comment
two.
the
primary
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
"jetty"
is
a
solid
structure
that
opposes
itself
to
the
force
of
the
waves.
that
is
also
the
meaning
of
the
french
word
"jetty
which
appears
in
the
french
version
of
comment
two.
the
french
word
for
an
open
pile
pier
is
appontement,
and
that
word
does
not
appear
in
any
of
the
discussions
of
article
8
or
comment
two.
california's
interpretation
of
this
comment
to
include
any
permanent
structure
jutting
into
the
sea
would
strip
it,
we
submit,
of
any
logical
relationship
to
article
8.
as
i
mentioned,
article
8
is
concerned
with
structures
that
enclose
or
subdue
the
water;
these
structures
appropriate
part
of
the
sea
and
make
it
an
adjunct
to
the
land.
but
under
california's
theory,
any
structure
jutting
into
the
sea
would
be
assimilated
to
a
harbor.
examples
would
be
a
long
intake
pipe
resting
on
stilts
or
a
sewage
discharge
pipe
that
runs
out
a
half
mile
before
it
sinks
into
the
water,
or
a
catwalk
between
the
shore
and
an
artificial
island,
and
these
aren't
just
hypothetical
examples
because
one
of
the
piers
in
this
case,
as
the
court
will
see
when
it
examines
the
pictures,
is
nothing
but
an
elevated
pipeline.
california
states
that
it
carries
millions
of
tons
of
cargo.
what
in
fact
is
happening
is
that
petroleum
is
being
pumped
continuously
through
these
pipes
to
vessels
at
sea,
and
that
in
california's
view
would
extend
the
coastline
and
give
the
state
potential
claims
to
new
mineral
rights
worth
millions
of
dollars
of
value
just
because
a
pipeline
has
been
erected
on
stilts
into
the
ocean.
we
believe
that
this
court's
decisions
support
our
more
measured
interpretation
of
the
second
comment
to
article
8.
in
louisiana,
this
court
held
that
solid
jetties
which
had
a
true
coast
protective
function
and
which
indirectly
sheltered
the
inlet
to
a
harbor
were
covered
by
comment
two.
that
we
submit
is
an
application
of
article
8
which
is
true
to
its
purpose
and
quite
different
from
california's
proposed
application.
its
piers
have
virtually
no
impact
on
hydrographic
conditions.
that
is,
they
do
not
provide
any
shelter
against
the
waves
or
the
undercurrents
of
the
ocean.
indeed,
they
were
specifically
designed
to
elevate
a
platform
above
the
turbulence
of
the
ocean
without
resisting
the
waves
in
any
manner.
no
decision
of
this
court
or
any
other
court
suggests
that
structures
such
as
these
should
be
assimilated
to
harbor
works
within
the
meaning
of
article
8.
our
view
that
these
piers
are
not
part
of
the
coast
is
supported
by
principles
of
international
law
recognized
before
the
adoption
of
the
geneva
convention.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
is
appontement.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
right.
that's
correct.
no
court
or
commentator
stated
before
1958
that
open
pile
piers
unconnected
to
a
harbor
were
entitled
to
the
exceptional
status
of
harbor
works
or
that
they
extended
the
territorial
sea.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
thorough
examination
of
the
historical
materials
that
was
prepared
by
professor
lauterpacht
and
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
although
california's
expert
expressed
a
different
opinion
on
the
ultimate
issues
in
this
case,
he
was
candid
to
acknowledge
that
open
pile
piers
unconnected
to
harbors
receive
no
specific
mention
in
any
authority
before
the
international
law
commission
began
its
codification
work,
and
this
is
significant
because
article
8
was
intended
to
be
consistent
with
the
positive
law
now
in
force.
that
was
stated
in
the
sixth
report
of
the
ilc
and
that
thought
was
again
repeated
by
the
report
of
the
geneva
convention
in
1958.
california
has,
of
course,
found
references
to
jetties
and
piers
in
summaries
of
discussions
of
the
international
law
commission
in
1956,
and
from
this
it
argues
that
the
ilc
must
have
believed
that
open
pile
piers
unconnected
to
a
harbor
were
coast
extending
structures.
but
these
references
simply
do
not
support
california's
theory.
in
the
first
place,
the
references
that
california
relies
on
were
by
english
delegates
and
the
primary
meaning
of
pier
and
jetty
in
british
usage,
as
the
oxford
english
dictionary
teaches
us,
is
a
solid
stone
structure
that
changes
hydrographic
conditions
that
protects
against
the
forces
of
the
waves.
moreover,
all
of
these
comments
were
made
in
the
context
of
discussing
true
harbor
works.
there
were
no
references
to
isolated
piers
unconnected
with
a
harbor,
because
this,
of
course,
is
the
focus
of
article
8,
harbor
works,
and
ports
or
harbors
are
define
as
structures
that
enclose
the
ocean
and
provide
protection.
we
note
in
this
connection
that
long
jetties
are
often
solid
stone
structures
which
protect
the
inlets
to
harbors
or
inland
waters
as
they
are
found
off
the
coast
of
this
country.
in
louisiana
and
in
texas,
solid
stone
jetties
of
over
three
miles
in
length
are
found
right
off
the
coastline.
under
these
circumstances,
the
delegates'
references
to
jetties
and
piers
can't
logically
be
relied
on
by
california
to
support
its
theory.
if
the
delegates
were
in
fact
contemplating
solid
stone
structures
or
structures
that
were
connected
with
harbors,
which
we
submit
is
the
most
likely
inference,
then
these
discussions
support
our
interpretation,
not
that
of
california.
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
in
conclusion
that
i
think
is
important
when
this
case
is
viewed
from
a
policy
point
of
view,
as
california
would
have
it
in
its
opening
reply
brief.
the
united
states
does
not
question
the
value
of
these
piers
to
california.
they
serve
a
socially
significant
purpose.
likewise,
the
coastal
states
have
an
interest
in
elevated
causeways
and
offshore
oil
rigs
and
in
artificial
islands,
but
none
of
these
are
coast
extending
structures.
california's
open
pile
piers
are
different
from
every
other
structure
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
part
of
the
coast,
and
they
can
only
be
compared
we
submit
with
the
elevated
causeways
that
were
considered
by
the
court
in
the
florida
case
that
we
discuss
in
our
briefs.
accordingly,
even
though
california
has
a
perfect
right
to
use
and
enjoy
these
piers,
they
do
not
enlarge
the
three-mile
zone
extending
seaward
from
the
low
water
line
on
the
shore.
i
need
only
add
one
additional
point,
and
that
is
that
if
california's
theory
were
accepted
by
this
court,
it
would
result
in
an
extension
of
the
territorial
sea
of
the
united
states
and
its
contiguous
zone
off
the
shores
of
all
of
the
united
states'
coastal
domain.
contrary
to
the
position
that
this
country
has
taken
in
its
international
relations
with
other
nations,
the
record
in
this
case
describes
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
negotiations
with
nations
such
as
mexico
where
we
have
refused
to
use
piers
of
this
kind
even
though
it
would
be
to
our
economic
interest
to
use
those
piers.
the
imperial
beach
pier
could
have
been
used
by
this
country
to
extend
the
contiguous
zone
and
the
territorial
sea
in
its
1970
negotiations
with
mexico,
but
we
didn't
use
it
because
we
think
it
is
wrong
in
principle.
this
is
not
an
article
3
structure
and
it
is
not
an
article
8
structure
and
we
have
not
therefore
used
it
as
a
coast
extending
device
in
our
own
international
dealings.
we
are
of
the
view
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
don't
suggest
that,
your
honor.
this
is
a
question
of
international
law
that
is
determined
by
the
convention
itself.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
a
bargaining
process?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
took
a
bargaining
position
that
was
disadvantageous
to
ourselves
because
we
believed
that
it
was
wrong
to
use
structures
of
this
kind
as
a
matter
of
international
law.
i
don't
suggest
that
this
is
controlling
of
the
outcome
in
this
case,
but
it
is
a
useful
datum
i
believe
to
bear
in
mind.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
second
decision
in
this
litigation,
an
interpretation
under
the
submerged
lands
act
of
article
8
would
also
extend
the
coastline
in
our
international
dealings
because
the
one
standard
is
applicable,
and
that
is
the
standard
of
article
8.
we
are
of
the
view
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
rests
with
those
persons
who
seek
to
enlarge
the
territorial
sea
and
to
cut
back
on
the
freedom
of
the
high
seas
by
extending
the
three-mile
zone
off
the
coast.
that
burden
should
be
particularly
weighty
when
the
proposed
base
point
is
artificial,
when
it
does
not
push
back
the
sea
by
extending
the
land
domain
and
when
it
has
no
relationship
to
harbor
works
or
coast
protective
structures
that
traditionally
have
been
accorded
exceptional
status
under
international
law.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
request
that
all
of
the
recommendations
of
the
special
master
be
adopted
by
the
court.
thank
you.
