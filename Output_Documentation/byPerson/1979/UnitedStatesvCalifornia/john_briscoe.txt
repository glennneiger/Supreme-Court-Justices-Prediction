mr.
john
briscoe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
today
on
california's
exception
to
the
report
of
the
special
master.
two
years
ago
the
parties
cross-petitioned
this
court
for
a
fourth
supplemental
decree
with
respect
to
three
questions.
the
matter
was
referred
to
a
special
master,
alfred
arraj,
whose
report
was
ordered
filed
last
october.
as
to
the
master's
recommendation
on
the
first
two
questions,
neither
party
has
expected.
california
has
expected
to
the
master's
recommendation
on
the
third
question
which
concerns
the
title
to
approximately
2,500
acres
of
submerged
land
off
the
coast
of
california,
virtually
all
of
which
lies
in
areas
of
proven
oil
reserves.
the
question
in
essence
before
the
court
today
is
whether
california's
title
to
these
lands
depends,
as
the
government
urges,
on
whether
certain
man-made
structures
on
the
coast
of
california
are
built
of
rock
rubble
or
of
pilings.
before
getting
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
since
this
was
filed
in
1945,
perhaps
a
brief
synopsis
of
what
has
occurred
would
be
in
order.
it
was
filed
in
1945
by
the
united
states
against
california
in
this
court's
original
juridiction,
and
the
question
then
presented
was
the
ownership
of
all
of
the
lands
within
the
three-mile
belt
of
sea
off
the
coast
of
california.
the
first
decision
handed
down
in
1947
by
this
court
held
that
these
lands
were
not
owned
by
california
and
although
the
government
was
not
expressly
held
to
be
the
owner,
was
held
to
hold
paramount
rights
in
these
lands.
the
decision
was
overturned
as
it
were
in
1953
when
congress
enacted
the
submerged
lands
act
which
quit
claimed
or
restored,
in
the
words
of
one
of
this
court's
decisions
in
this
litigation,
the
submerged
lands
back
to
the
coastal
states.
in
the
case
of
california,
this
quit
claim
operated
with
respect
to
all
submerged
lands
lying
within
three
geographic
miles
of
the
coastline.
that
was
the
expression
used.
now,
insofar
as
relevance
here,
coastline
was
defined
merely
as
the
line
of
ordinary
low
water
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea.
now,
at
that
time,
in
1953,
oil
technology
had
not
reached
the
sophistication
that
it
did
shortly
and
there
was
no
great
need
to
ascertain
the
location
of
this
three-mile
boundary
which
separated
the
submerged
lands
owned
by
the
state
of
california,
that
is
those
two
or
three
miles
out
on
the
continental
shelf
lands
owned
by
the
united
states,
but
by
as
early
sixties
technology
had
developed
and
the
parties
needed
a
more
definite
determination
as
to
the
location
of
this
boundary
and
consequently
the
united
states
asked
for
a
supplemental
decree
from
this
court.
the
second
decision
consequently
was
in
1965
and
the
most
pertinent
element
of
that
decision
was
this
court's
recognition
that
the
expression
"coastline"
as
defined
in
the
act
was
vague
and
its
adoption
for
the
purpose
of
lending
greater
precision
to
this
word
of
the
provisions
of
a
multilateral
treaty
which
had
recently
gone
into
effect,
that
was
the
1958
geneva
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
the
contiguous
zone.
the
court
recognized
that
this
convention
contained
a
number
of
very
specific
rules
for
measuring
the
three-mile
belt
of
territorial
waters
and
felt
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
adopt
these
definitions
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
so
this
controversy
which
was
originally
domestic
only
in
nature
has
now
taken
on
an
international
law
cast.
in
applying
the
convention
in
1965
and
subsequently
in
the
1969
louisiana
case
and
subsequent
to
that
in
1977,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
coastline
as
defined
in
the
submerged
lands
act
includes
not
only
the
natural
features
of
the
coast
but
also
certain
coastal
facilities
and
among
these
are
rock
rubble
breakwaters,
jetties
and
what
are
known
at
least
in
california
as
beach
erosion
groins.
the
question
in
the
present
case
is
whether
16
other
structures
on
the
california
coast
are
likewise
to
be
treated
as
parts
of
the
coast
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
these
structures,
unlike
the
forty
or
so
others
on
the
california
coast
which
this
court
has
decreed
be
parts
of
the
coast,
are
not
built
of
rubble
but
are
built
instead
on
pilings.
the
special
master
recommended
that
this
court
decree
that
these
structures
do
not
constitute
parts
of
california's
coastline
and
it
is
to
that
recommendation
that
we
except.
one
of
these
piers
is
in
northern
california,
near
san
francisco.
the
other
--
i
think
that
is
the
most
recently
built
also,
in
1972.
the
other
15
piers
are
all
located
in
southern
california,
and
there
is
a
particularly
good
reason
for
that.
a
combination
of
geographical
factors
which
we
have
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
opening
brief
contributed
to
this.
southern
california,
the
coastline
being
approximately
500
miles,
in
its
natural
condition
contained
only
one
fully
enclosed
natural
harbor
and
that
was
at
san
diego
at
the
extreme
southerly
end
of
the
state.
on
the
other
hand,
because
of
the
general
alignment
of
the
coast,
it
is
almost
east
and
west,
if
you
ever
noticed
that
on
a
chart.
it
is
not
a
north-south
coastline.
the
general
alignment
of
the
coast,
a
fringe
of
offshore
islands
which
act
as
breakwaters
to
approaching
waves,
and
a
series
of
submarine
canyons
which
also
have
the
effect
of
dissipating
wave
energy.
i
don't
pretend
to
be
an
expert
in
oceanography,
but
if
you
have
never
noticed
swells
coming
in
from
the
sea,
they
pile
up,
they
reach
greater
heights
than
they
were
at
sea,
they
reach
these
greater
heights
and
then
break.
the
submarine
canyons
along
the
coastline
of
california
and
vestiges
of
ancient
rivers
serve
to
dissipate
that
wave
energy.
so
as
a
consequence,
because
there
was
only
one
natural
harbor,
piers
were
erected
on
the
coast
of
southern
california
to
serve
as
the
ports
of
that
area
of
the
coastline
as
the
state
of
california
began
to
develop,
after
1850,
and
it
wasn't
until
after
the
turn
of
the
century
that
artificial
breakwaters
were
built
to
create
more
or
less
all-weather
harbors
and
we
begin
to
find
these
other
structures
which
this
court
has
already
addressed,
jetties
and
beach
erosion
groins
which
have
been
implaced
largely
to
protect
the
beach
or
to
restore
an
eroding
shoreline.
mr.
john
briscoe
yes,
it
was.
in
fact,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
not
in
very
good
condition
right
now
and,
as
the
testimony
before
the
special
master
shows,
we
don't
know
what
the
future
of
that
will
be,
but
that
was
used
and
was
designed
for
and
in
fact
was
used
for
pleasure
craft,
largely
patrons
of
the
biltmore
hotel.
mr.
john
briscoe
yes.
now,
to
get
into
the
significance
of
the
difference
between
a
port
and
harbor,
i
will
in
a
second,
but
essentially
the
special
mater
found
and
the
parties
agree,
both
parties
agree
that
a
port
is
a
place
where
vessels
may
load
or
unload
their
passengers
or
cargo,
and
a
port
may
or
may
not
be
part
of
a
harbor
which,
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
protected
area.
you
can
have
a
port
without
necessarily
having
a
harbor.
the
special
master
found
that
five
of
the
piers
that
are
presently
in
dispute
in
this
matter
are
at
the
present
time
used
for
the
loading
and
unloading
of
passengers
and
cargo,
and
these
are
primarily
used
to
service
the
offshore
oil
installations
in
the
santa
barbara
channel.
the
crews
are
taken
to
these
installations,
supplies,
tools
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
briscoe
i
believe
--
if
any
of
you
have
noticed
the
blue
binder,
i
believe
that
is
exhibit
i,
it
has
photographs
and
it
has
all
the
specifications
and
historic
data,
and
so
forth,
on
the
piers.
the
longest
--
the
special
master
reported
that
the
longest
was
the
oceanside
pier
--
i
believe
the
longest
was
the
rincon
pier
which
is
3,500
feet.
there
is
a
scale
on
one
of
the
charts.
the
others
range
in
length
from
approximately
1,000
feet
to
--
mr.
john
briscoe
exhibit
i.
i'm
sorry.
it
is
a
large
blue
binder
with
a
series
of
photographs.
it
has
each
of
these
piers
photographed
from
above,
from
the
ground
and
--
mr.
john
briscoe
pardon?
mr.
john
briscoe
no,
i'm
sorry,
there's
not.
this
was
part
of
the
record
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
correct.
it
is
california's
exhibit
i.
mr.
john
briscoe
yes.
in
fact,
we
drew
them.
mr.
john
briscoe
yes.
i
was
saying,
this
exhibit
i
has
very
exact
specifications.
it
has
a
specification
drawing
on
each
one
of
these.
but
i
think
you
will
note
that
the
rincon
pier,
which
is
the
largest
of
all
of
them,
and
one
of
the
five
presently
used
as
a
port,
is
approximately
3,500
feet
in
length.
mr.
john
briscoe
well,
certainly
the
piers
on
the
california
coast
historically
did.
what
we
find
today,
the
remaining
eleven
piers,
those
that
are
not
predominantly
used
for
the
berthing
of
vessels
--
mr.
john
briscoe
some
of
them
were,
that's
correct.
the
huntington
and
the
newport
pier,
these
were
principal
ports
along
those
parts
of
the
coast.
others,
however,
some
of
them
were
recently
built,
such
as
the
one
near
san
francisco,
sharp,
is
a
purely
recreational
pier.
it
is
used
for
strolling
and
getting
out
beyond
the
serf
zone
to
cast
your
line.
so,
in
summary,
the
older
ones
were
built
to
serve
as
ports
and
have
gradually
become
converted.
i
think
a
significant
feature
is
that
every
one
of
these
piers
can
be
used
as
a
commercial
or
a
military
port
in
virtually
a
matter
of
hours
if
the
need
arises.
during
world
war
ii,
as
mr.
harring
testified
before
its
special
master,
every
single
pier
on
the
california
coast
was
occupied
by
the
coast
guard,
and
some
of
these
were
put
to
use
immediately
as
ports
for
the
patrol
vessels
and
others
were
simply
held
to
prevent
their
use
by
enemy
craft.
now,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
three
things.
as
we
mentioned,
this
court
has
adopted
the
geneva
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
--
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
correct.
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
correct.
mr.
john
briscoe
that
is
also
correct,
yes.
as
we
mentioned,
the
convention
on
the
territorial
waters
has
been
adopted
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
and
our
principal
point
is
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
convention,
which
consists
predominantly
of
two
things.
it
consists
of
a
record
of
the
discussions
of
the
commission
that
drafted
it,
and
it
consists
of
a
commentary
to
the
various
articles,
in
particular
article
8.
that
legislative
history
demonstrates
clearly
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
drafters
of
the
convention
to
include
structures
such
as
the
16
piers
as
part
of
the
nation's
coastline.
secondly,
a
point
what
i
think
ought
to
be
emphasized
is
that
california
cannot
enlarge
its
submerged
lands
grant
by
the
expedient
of
building
a
new
pier
or
a
new
jetty
or
groin,
for
that
matter.
the
special
master
recognizes
this,
but
i
think
it
is
worth
reiterating.
the
united
states,
through
its
power
over
navigable
waters,
has
the
ability
to
prevent
any
such
structure
from
being
built.
it
can
even
order
the
removal
of
it
or
it
can
impose
conditions,
as
it
has
in
the
case
of
california,
if
you
want
to
build
a
structure
you
must
waive
your
claim
to
any
additional
submerged
lands
that
you
would
otherwise
be
entitled
to.
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
correct.
we
might
be
able
to
build
piers
--
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
correct.
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
exactly
correct.
the
third
point
we
would
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
is
that
this
court
has
set
forth
very
clear
principles
to
guide
the
determination
of
this
controversy
and
we
submit
that
this
special
master
simply
did
not
employ
those.
he
looked
instead
to
a
test
that
was
propounded
by
professors
mcdougal
and
burke
which
the
special
master
calls
the
reasonableness
test.
and
we
would
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
test
was
not
designed
by
the
authors
to
be
used
in
connection
with
structures
built
on
the
coastline,
it
was
designed
to
be
used
for
structures
unconnected
with
the
coast,
that
is,
artificial
islands.
turning
to
the
convention
on
territorial
waters,
article
viii
is
the
one
provision
that
expressly
deals
with
structures
erected
on
the
coast
and
jutting
out
to
see,
and
i
submit
that
for
that
reason
is
the
appropriate
place
to
begin.
the
text
of
article
8,
the
english
text
--
and
i
emphasize
that
--
reads,
"for
the
purpose
of
delimiting
the
territorial
sea,
the
outermost
permanent
harbour
works
which
form
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
works
shall
be
regarded
as
forming
part
of
the
coast."
now,
particularly
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
expression
harbor
and
harbor
works
leaps
out,
and
indeed
the
united
states
seizes
on
those
two
words
and
points
out
that
none
of
these
piers
are
parts
of
a
harbor,
none
of
these
piers
create
shelter,
create
a
harbor
and
thus
they
cannot
be
harbor
works.
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
article
8
embraces
much
more
than
structures
strictly
associated
with
a
harbor.
we
begin
by
noting
that
in
the
1966
decree
in
this
case,
which
implemented
the
'65
decision,
this
court
decreed
that
the
california
coastline
includes
the
outermost
permanent
harbor
works
within
the
meaning
of
article
8
and
perhaps
the
single
most
important
factor
to
identify
at
the
outset
in
ascertaining
the
meaning
of
the
article
is
that
the
convention
was
authenticated
in
more
than
one
language,
french
and
english
being
the
principal
languages.
article
32
provides
that
each
text
is
equally
authentic.
when
we
look
at
the
french
text
of
article
8,
it
is
very
interesting.
we
don't
find
the
expression
harbor
works
and
we
don't
find
the
expression
harbor.
the
french
text
speaks
of
the
permanent
installations
of
a
port
system
and
indeed,
the
international
law
commission,
which
drafted
the
convention,
entitled
even
in
the
english
version,
entitled
this
article
"ports."
so
i
think
the
bottom
line
clearly
is
that
the
technical
distinction,
which
is
correct,
between
a
port
and
a
harbor
was
completely
immaterial
to
the
international
law
commission,
and
indeed
this
court
has
recognized
in
that
decree,
which
is
382
u.s.,
p.
450
--
that
is
the
page
at
which
the
port
facilities
are
addressed
--
that
port
facilities
are
to
be
treated
as
parts
of
the
coast.
mr.
john
briscoe
yes.
mr.
john
briscoe
that
is
correct,
although,
as
we
pointed
out,
the
southern
california
coast
has
these
natural
features.
the
one
pier
in
northern
california
is
not
protected
in
that
fashion,
but
there
are
natural
features
that
enable
vessels
to
tie
up
at
these
piers
on
the
southern
california
coast
330
days
a
year
and
not
need
the
benefit
of
an
artificial
breakwater.
so
that
accounts
for
the
reason
we
have
so
many
and
why
it
was
some
time
before
artificial
harbors
were
built.
the
commerce
of
southern
california
was
progressing
nicely
without
them.
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
correct,
it
is
an
artificial
harbor
and
that
is
the
biggest
example.
that
breakwater
was
begun
about
1910.
there
was
a
tremendous
war
over
where
that
was
going
to
be
located.
it
was
begun
about
1910
and
completed
about
1948,
after
world
war
ii.
the
principal
commerce
of
southern
california
very
naturally
settles
there
and
settles
also
in
san
diego
which
has
been
improved
over
its
natural
condition.
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
right.
mr.
john
briscoe
you
are
talking
about
a
signatory
to
the
convention,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
briscoe
the
united
states
is
also,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
briscoe
oh,
yes,
that
is
a
different
matter.
i
understood
that
--
mr.
john
briscoe
no,
i
believe
not.
i
would
cite
the
court
to
the
case
of
reed
v.
weiser,
the
closest
case
on
point.
that
was
a
second
circuit
decision
in
1977
about
550
2d.
that
case
dealt
with
the
warsaw
convention
on
the
liability
of
air
carriers
and
a
very
identical
problem
was
presented
there.
the
air
carriers
were
limited
in
their
liability
and
so
the
plaintiff
sued
agents
of
the
air
carriers
and
the
question
arose
were
these
agents,
employees
and
so
forth
to
be
within
the
umbrella
of
the
protection
of
the
convention,
and
the
court
said
we
have
to
look
--
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
english
language,
we
have
to
look
to
what
the
french
text
of
the
convention
says.
mr.
john
briscoe
no.
i
would
suppose
there
is
not
an
ambiguity
to
begin
with,
but
i
would
suggest
this.
this
court
has
immediately,
particularly
in
the
louisiana
case,
in
addressing
these
particular
problems
of
the
meaning
of
various
articles
in
the
convention,
low
tide
elevations,
islands,
bays,
and
so
forth,
without
any
hesitation
this
court
has
immediately
looked
to
the
preparatory
work,
the
discussions
of
the
delegates
and
the
official
commentary,
and
so
i
would
say
that
is
the
accepted
--
that
has
been
the
traditional
approach
of
this
court
in
the
submerged
lands
litigation.
mr.
john
briscoe
i
believe
it
was
"jetty"
and
"pier.
mr.
john
briscoe
yes,
which
at
bottom
is
of
little
consequence
because
we
find
the
words
interchanged.
on
that
subject,
that
takes
us
to
the
question
of
the
eleven
piers
which
are
not
predominantly
used
as
ports
but
are
typical
recreational
piers.
they
have
restaurants
on
them,
people
fish,
and
so
forth.
now,
there
are
approximately
25
or
so
structures,
artificial
structures
on
the
california
coast
which
have
been
decreed
to
be
a
part
of
our
coast,
that
have
no
connection
whatever
to
a
port
or
a
harbor.
just
for
argument,
we
might
assume
that
these
eleven
piers
do
not.
the
question
is
what
is
the
principle
that
makes
those
structures
parts
of
the
coastline,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
in
the
discussions
of
the
international
law
commission
and
in
the
official
commentary
we
find
that,
although
when
the
commission
began
its
work
in
1952
--
the
convention
wasn't
adopted
until
'58
--
we
find
that
it
initially
addressed
its
problem
in
the
context
of
ports,
and
indeed
that
is
a
question
of
far
broader
significance.
but
on
july
1,
1954,
we
see
for
the
first
time
the
discussion
of
a
whole
range
of
coastal
structures
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
port
or
a
harbor,
jetties
that
were
being
used
to
harness
tidal
energy,
coast
protective
works,
other
kinds
of
jetties.
and
as
the
testimony
is
clear,
a
jetty
or
may
not
have
any
connection
with
a
port
or
harbor.
and
what
the
commission
did
is
append
to
the
test
of
article
8
a
comment
which
became
an
official
commentary
when
the
convention
was
forwarded
to
the
general
assembly
in
1956,
which
read
"permanent
structures
erected
on
the
coast
and
jutting
out
to
sea
(such
as
jetties
and
protecting
walls
or
dykes)
are
deemed
to
be
harbour
works."
now,
that
paragraph
is
very
significant.
for
one,
this
court
has
cited
it,
holding
article
8
expressly
covers
artificial
structures
not
closely
linked
to
ports.
but
it
is
also
very
significant
because
of
how
it
came
about.
when
this
discussion
first
occurred
in
1954,
mr.
francois,
the
delegate
from
france,
suggested
a
separate
article
for
it.
the
discussion
went
on
and
he
said
we
will
treat
protecting
walls
and
so
forth
in
a
separate
article,
but
instead
we
find
that
it
was
appended
as
a
comment
and
later
as
an
official
commentary
to
it.
indeed,
in
1955,
after
this
discussion
had
gone
on,
there
was
some
discussion
--
the
british
government
was
concerned
about
an
extraordinarily
long
pier,
seven-mile-long
pier
being
built
in
the
persian
gulf,
and
in
the
course
of
asking
are
we
going
to
allow
this
kind
of
structure
to
be
used,
he
referred
to
"the
commission's
rule
that
jetties
and
piers
be
treated
as
part
of
the
coastline."
now,
that
is
probably
the
single
most
telling
point
in
the
entire
legislative
history
--
mr.
john
briscoe
yes.
mr.
john
briscoe
to
help
us
understand
the
meaning
of
the
convention
which
this
court
in
1965
adopted
wholesale.
in
1965,
this
court
said
this
convention
contains
well
developed
specific
rules
for
determining
the
base
line
from
which
you
measure
the
territorial
sea.
we
are
going
to
adopt
this
convention
wholesale
for
the
purpose
of
defining
coastline,
which
was
the
word
used
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
base
line
coastline
becoming
the
same
thing
for
that
purpose.
so
i
am
pointing
to
legislative
deliberations,
if
you
will,
that
took
place
in
1955
with
respect
to
a
convention
that
was
adopted
in
1958
and
which
later
this
court
adopted
for
purposes
of
the
earlier
submerged
lands
act.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
any
anomaly
in
using
post-legislative
declarations
--
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
correct.
i
would
like
to
make
two
further
points.
we
believe
that
the
position
we
are
taking
is
a
reasonable
position.
we
don't
see
that
distinguishing
between
structures
because
one
happens
to
be
built
or
rubber
and
one
happens
to
be
built
of
pilings
makes
any
difference.
and
indeed
the
poor
mariner
at
sea
who
is
looking
at
a
chart
and
trying
to
determine
whether
he
is
within
or
without
the
three-mile
belt
can't
tell
whether
the
structure
he
sees
is
a
pier
or
a
jetty
or
some
other
thing.
they
all
appear
the
same.
indeed,
the
former
geographer
of
the
department
of
state,
dr.
g.
edsel
pearcy,
in
three
publications,
in
1959,
1965,
and
1969,
expressed
the
view,
indicated
the
view
that
piers
were
to
be
regarded
as
forming
parts
of
the
coast.
lastly,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
this
court
has
on
no
fewer
than
seven
occasions
held
that
piers
are
extensions
of
the
land
for
purposes
of
admiralty
and
harbor
workers
compensation
cases.
the
most
recent
was
the
nacirema
case
in
1969
which
at
page
215
cites
approximately
six
earlier
cases
of
this
court
to
the
same
effect.
mr.
john
briscoe
that
is
unquestionably
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
briscoe
well,
yes,
but
the
rule
had
been
developed
that
extensions
such
as
piers
were
clearly
to
be
treated
as
parts
of
the
land.
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
right,
but
i
wanted
to
point
out
one
thing.
we
concede
that
these
cases
are
not
controlling,
but
there
is
one
point
to
be
made
which
i
neglected
to
make
in
the
briefs,
and
that
is
this.
in
the
1969
louisiana
case
--
and
i
am
referring
to
page
64
--
this
court
was
dealing
with
the
problem
of
islands
at
the
mouths
of
bays
and
whether
they
should
be
treated
as
headlands.
it
examined
the
legislative
history
and
it
came
up
with
what
it
called
a
common
sense
approach,
and
then
it
noted
that
other
courts
were
of
the
same
view,
and
in
support
it
cited
a
british
admiralty
case,
the
anna.
now,
i
submit
that
if
it
is
appropriate
to
look
to
british
admiralty
cases
to
support
the
common
sense
approach,
it
is
no
less
appropriate
to
look
to
our
own
domestic
admiralty
cases
for
support
in
looking
for
the
correct
and
for
the
common
sense
approach.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
john
briscoe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
point
i
want
to
rebut
very
emphatically
is
the
suggestion
that
what
this
court
decides
in
this
case
can
somehow
compel
the
united
states
to
do
something
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs.
that
is
absolutely
not
the
case.
mr.
john
briscoe
well,
i
would
characterize
it
that
way
too.
this
whole
idea
that
this
court
is
somehow
to
give
deference
to
the
position
of
the
state
department
or
the
position
of
the
department
of
the
interior
was
very
thoroughly
analyzed
by
the
former
chief
of
the
marine
resources
section
of
the
justice
department,
jonathan
charney,
in
an
article
in
volume
7
of
the
vanderbilt
journal
of
transnational
law,
and
his
conclusion
is
that
deference
to
the
position
of
the
executive
should
play
no
role.
this
court
may
hold
that
piers
are
parts
of
the
coastline
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
and
if
the
government
chooses
not
to
employ
them
as
base
points
in
its
claim
of
territorial
sea,
it
is
perfectly
free
to
do
so.
mr.
john
briscoe
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
briscoe
that's
correct.
mr.
john
briscoe
well,
we
would
suggest
that
also
the
british
government,
which
takes
the
opposite
view,
that
piers
ought
to
be
treated
as
parts
of
the
coast,
whether
they
are
port
piers
or
recreational
piers
--
mr.
john
briscoe
well,
the
parties
that
negotiated
the
treaty
with
mexico,
which
mr.
shapiro
referred
to,
were
not
the
parties
who
negotiated
the
geneva
convention.
these
events
were
twenty
years
apart.
in
fact,
if
we
look
to
contemporaneous
american
practice
at
the
time,
dr.
pearcy's
articles
are
probably
the
best
touchstone
of
what
american
practice
on
this
very
question
was.
mr.
shapiro
remarked
that
all
the
discussion
concerned
structures
in
the
context
of
harbor
works,
and
yet
in
the
government's
briefs,
on
page
23,
it
concedes
that
the
persian
gulf
pier,
the
7-mile
long
pier
was
apparently
unconnected
with
the
harbor,
and
that
is
exactly
the
case.
the
concession
has
already
been
made.
thank
you.
