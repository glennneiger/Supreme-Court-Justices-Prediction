there
is
some
little
difference
between
the
english
language
and
the
american
language.
justice

stewart
don't
i
remember
also
in
your
brief,
general
briscoe,
that
you
make
the
point
that
the
words
"port"
and
"harbor"
mean
something
different
in
england
from
what
they
do
in
the
united
states
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
it.
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
already
told
us,
the
court
rejected
that
test
and
adopted
rather
the
convention
test.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
a
breakwater
that
extends
out
to
sea,
slants
off
the
shore
and
creates
some
calm
water
behind
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
breakwater
would
even
though
all
the
ships
did
was
come
around
the
breakwater
and
anchor
just
inside
the
breakwater
and
unload
by
boat?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
breakwater
could?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
just
like
the
revenue
code,
that
is
just
because
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
deny
that
at
least
some
of
these
piers
are
used
regularly
by
ships?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
define
port
like
your
colleague,
they
are
ports?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
word
"port"
used
in
the
convention?
