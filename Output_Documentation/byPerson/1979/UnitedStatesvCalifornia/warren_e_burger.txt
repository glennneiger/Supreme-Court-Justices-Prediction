we
will
hear
argument
next
in
united
states
v.
california.
mr.
briscoe,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
the
dimensions
of
these
five
piers
roughly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
you
refer
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
one
for
each
of
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
one
for
each
of
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
accept
the
special
master's
maps
in
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
preclude
california
from
going
out
and
extending
a
whole
lot
of
these
things
up
and
down
the
coast
while
the
case
is
pending.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
wouldn't
get
any
benefit
out
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
couldn't
build
it
just
for
this
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
san
pedro
is
an
actual
harbor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
not
uncommon
in
these
conventions
for
the
language
of
french,
for
example,
not
to
be
precisely
the
same
as
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
the
general
rule
that
when
american
courts
are
dealing
with
such
a
convention
or
treaty
that
we
take
the
american
expression
of
it
and
we
are
not
bound
by
how
someone
else
has
translated
the
the
american
into
french.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
these
purposes,
however,
do
we
not
take
english-american
as
against
the
french?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
here
in
the
english
version,
the
american
english
version?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
purpose
there
is
somewhat
different,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
it
is
thought
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
be
within
sight
of
salt
water
in
order
to
have
coverage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
shapiro,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
some
of
those
things
you
were
just
describing
are
put
there
for
the
very
purpose
of
developing
accretions
to
the
land,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is,
the
sand
that
is
carried
and
the
silt
carried
on
the
waves.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
say
there
is
no
such
function
of
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
no.
oh,
no,
you
end
up
with
exactly
the
same
low
water
line
on
the
shore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
they
be
equivalent
to
the
small
peninsulas
that
are
developed
by
the
groins
or
the
sand
gradually
builds
up
along
side
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
in
part
because
they
are
not
connected
with
the
mainland?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
california
would
be
bound
by
the
american
position
in
those
treaty
negotiations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
bargaining
process,
is
it
not,
not
a
judicial
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
american
position,
the
u.s.
position
was
a
bargaining
position.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
read
his
suggestion
that
way.
i
thought
he
said
it
was
just
a
straw
in
the
wind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
