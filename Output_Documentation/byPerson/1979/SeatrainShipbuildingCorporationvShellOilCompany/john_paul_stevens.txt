mr.
levander,
is
that
true
as
to
the
alaska
bulk
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
he
in
fact
decided
to
the
contrary.
i
mean,
the
court,
in
fact,
decided
to
the
contrary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
don't
you
have
to
judge
appealability
at
the
time
the
appeal
is
attempted
to
be
prosecuted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
that
time,
both
claims
were
still
being
made
and
neither
of
them
could
be
said
there
was
no
case
or
controversy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
mootness
arguments
--
i'm
just
addressing
your
mootness
argument,
at
the
time
of
the
remand
for
the
competitive
inquiry,
neither
theory
could
be
disposed
of
on
the
ground
that
it
was
moot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
your
argument
fail
if
there
had
been
15
or
16
similar
transactions
on
the
horizon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
would
fail
on
the
hypothetical
i've
given.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
say
possibly,
because
isn't
your
whole
argument
that
that
claim
is
moot
on
these
facts
and
i
posit
the
facts
where
it
would
not
be
moot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
each
of
which
might
have
the
same
impact
on
the
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
practical
consequence?
if
you
prevail
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
we
dismiss
the
appeal,
won't
the
case
be
right
back
here
almost
immediately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
this
difference
though
with
wetzel,
if
i'm
not
--
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly.
there,
there
was
precedent
rather
clearly
establishing
that
that
was
not
final
under
the
statute.
here,
i
think
the
government
agrees
the
question
is
open.
you
may
well
be
right,
but
you
don't
have
a
direct
precedent
for
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
klein,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions
of
the
shell
oil.
your
argument
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
shell,
as
i
understand,
because
they
have
quite
a
different
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
secondly,
is
it
not
correct
that
the
appealability
under
1292
(a)
(1),
the
denial
of
an
injunction
theory,
really
boils
down
to
the
same
question
as
appealability
under
1291
because
you
must,
even
on
that
theory,
assume
that
the
injunction
against
the
exercise
of
power
is
a
broader
form
of
relief
than
the
injunction
against
the
rescission
of
this
particular
deal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
even
if
they
were
precisely
the
same
claims
for
relief,
two
different
alternate
theories
of
getting
the
same
injunction,
under
1292
(a)
(1),
you
might
get
--
have
appealability
even
though
you
wouldn't
under
1291?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
that's
the
broader
point,
that's
what
i
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
chairman
kennedy
say
the
words
to
take
out
as
their
alternative?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's
somewhere
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
never
said
in
words
that
a
total
rescission
would
be
a
bad
idea,
did
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
--
you
don't
quote
him
as
saying
“we
want
the
total
payout
taken
out.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
klein
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
government
also
argues
that
if
you
just
had
a
transaction
authorized,
the
subsidy
with
the
restriction
on
it,
and
didn't
say
anything,
about
one's
--
one
way
or
another,
about
rescinding
the
transaction,
that
the
government
would
have
and
pursuant
to
its
general
powers
to
make
contracts
and
amend
them
and
so
forth,
they'd
have
the
power
to,
in
effect,
rescind
this
transaction.
would
you
agree
with
that?
in
other
words,
do
you
have
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
authority
for
the
legislative
history,
plus,
the
authority
for
six
months
permission
impliedly
prohibits
anything
else,
that's
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
you
had
a
statute
that
just
contemplated
one
transaction
like
the
chrysler
proposal
now
or
the
--
this
one
vessel
and
congress
said
“we'll
give
you
a
subsidy
for
this
transaction,
we'll
authorize
the
subsidy
for
this
transaction,
provided
there's
a
restriction
on
domestic
commerce
put
in
the
contract”
and
that
was
all
that
was
done
and
the
contract
was
made
pursuant
to
the
statute,
and
nothing
was
said,
one
way
or
another,
about
rescinding
it.
do
you
think
the
secretary
would
have
power
to
rescind
such
a
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
--
it
must
be
a
permanent
restriction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
they
did
agree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
agree.
the
owner
did
agree.
the
question
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
they
agree
to
do
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
would
boil
down,
mr.
shulman,
to
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
protect
your
clients
and
other
similarly
situated
from
competition
on
the
one
hand,
or
from
subsidized
competition
on
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it,
you're
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
locked
in
as
a
matter
of
economics.
none
of
the
domestic
trade
vessels
are
economically
able
to
compete
in
the
foreign
trade,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
the
subsidy.
