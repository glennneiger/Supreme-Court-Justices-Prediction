the
other
case,
seatrain
shipbuilding
corporation
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
petitioner,
seatrain
shipbuilding
received
a
construction
differential
subsidy
of
some
$29
million
under
title
v
of
the
merchant
marine
act
to
construct
the
supertanker
stuyvesant.
and
as
required
by
section
506
of
the
act,
the
petitioner
agreed
to
operate
the
stuyvesant
exclusively
in
foreign
trade.
however,
when
construction
of
the
tanker
was
completed,
there
wasn't
any
business
in
the
foreign
trade.
and
petitioner,
therefore,
asked
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
accept
a
promissory
note
in
the
full
amount
of
the
$29
million
subsidy
and
release
the
tanker
from
the
restrictions
that
limited
its
use
to
foreign
trade
and
precluded
its
use
in
domestic
trade
more
particularly
in
the
alaska
oil
trade.
the
secretary
granted
the
request
and
domestic
trade
competitors
in
the
alaska
trade
thereupon
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
prohibiting
the
secretary
from
granting
the
requested
release.
the
district
court
sustained
the
secretary's
action
holding
that
that
statute
authorized
the
secretary
to
take
such
actions
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed.
we
reversed.
we
hold
an
agreement
with
the
district
court
that
the
statute
does
not
limit
the
secretary's
powers
in
this
regard.
