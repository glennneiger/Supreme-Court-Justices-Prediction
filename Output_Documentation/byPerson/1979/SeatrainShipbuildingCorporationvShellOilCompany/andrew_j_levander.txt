mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
although
i
am
also
prepared
to
discuss
the
merits
of
this
case,
i
would
address
myself
primarily
to
the
jurisdiction
presented
here.
plaintiffs'
complaint
asserted
that
the
stuyvesant
transaction
which
is
at
issue
here
was
unlawful
for
essentially
three
reasons.
first
is
that
the
secretary
lacked
power
to
enter
into
such
transaction.
the
second
is
that,
given
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
secretary
had
abused
her
discretion
by
entering
into
the
transaction,
for
failing
to
consider
the
economic
impact
on
the
existing
domestic
traders
in
the
alaskan
trade.
third,
they
challenge
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
in
the
--
before
the
secretary,
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
on
november
22,
1977,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
secretary
had
power
to
enter
into
a
stuyvesant
type
of
transaction.
he
concluded,
however,
that
the
secretary
had
abused
her
discretion
by
failing
to
consider
the
economic
impact
issue.
the
district
court,
therefore,
granted
partial
summary
judgment
to
both
sides
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
secretary
for
determination
within
45
days
of
the
economic
impact
issue.
the
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
it
was
first
mentioned
to
the
district
court
by
mr.
mcdaniels
at
the
time
of
the
entry
of
order
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
no
--
a
footnote
addressed
this
issue.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
made
quite
clear
by
this
court's
decision
in
wetzel,
your
honor.
the
court
also
concluded
on
november
22nd,
the
district
court,
that
the
third
issue,
the
procedural
claim,
would
require
a
trial
and,
therefore,
did
not
grant
summary
judgment
either
way
on
that
issue.
on
november
30th,
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
here
who
i'll
refer
to
as
plaintiffs
since
we're
also
technically
respondents,
went
before
the
court
and
asked
them
to
modify
the
judgment.
first,
they
voluntarily
dismissed
their
procedural
claim.
second,
they
first
asked
the
court
to
enter
a
certification
under
28
u.s.c.,
1292
(b).
that
provision,
in
our
view,
is
the
only
provision
which
would
have
allowed
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
the
statutory
power
question.
the
district
court,
however,
intimated
that
it
was
not
--
it
didn't
think
that
was
appropriate
or
it
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
and
it
agreed
to
accept
the
plaintiffs'
second
suggestion,
which
was
that
it
enter
a
certification
under
rule
54
(b)
to
allow
an
immediate
appeal
of
the
statutory
question.
at
that
point,
petitioners
--
the
plaintiffs
appealed,
although
the
secretary
had
never
had
a
chance
to
render
its
decision
on
the
remand
on
that
point,
and
although
the
district
court
has
never
had
a
chance
to
address
the
remand
decision
which
came
down
while
the
appeal
was
pending.
we
submit
that
that
appeal
was
premature
and
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
power
to
hear
this
case.
primary
submission
of
plaintiffs
as
to
why
jurisdiction
iss
--
existed
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
november
30th
order
constituted
a
valid
rule
54
(b)
certification,
that's
the
question
of
the
secretary's
power.
rule
54
(b)
permits
the
district
court
to
enter
a
final
judgment
as
to
any
separate
claim
for
relief
even
though
the
litigation
as
a
whole
is
not
terminated.
for
example,
in
this
case,
suppose
the
plaintiffs
had
sued
the
secretary
regarding
the
stuyvesant
transaction
and,
in
addition,
had
sued
the
secretary
for
a
subsidy
that
they
claim
was
due
them
on
some
other
unrelated
transaction.
if
the
secretary,
excuse
me,
if
the
district
court,
during
the
course
of
that
litigation,
had
concluded
that
the
secretary
did
not
owe
them
the
subsidy
and
finally
determine
that
separate
claim
and
then
--
but
then,
there
were
further
proceedings
to
be
had
on
the
stuyvesant
claim,
then
the
district
court,
in
our
view,
would
have
had
the
power
to
enter
a
rule
54
(b)
certification
because,
then,
a
certification
would
have
been
finally
determined
and
that's
what
rule
54
(b)
exists
to
do.
that,
however,
in
our
view,
is
not
what
happened
here.
before
i
turn
to
that,
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
the
standard
of
review
of
the
54
(b)
requests
in
--
depends
on
what
is
being
challenged.
if
the
question
involves
whether
or
not
the
district
court
should
have
exercised
its
discretion
as
to
a
clearly
separate
claim,
then
this
court's
decision
in
sears,
roebuck
against
mackey
and
other
decisions
make
clear
that
there's
an
abusive
discretion
standard.
however,
the
court's
subsequent
decision
in
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
against
wetzel
makes
it
clear
that
where
the
question
is
simply
whether
or
not
there
are
separate
claims,
they
can
be
certified
under
rule
54
(b).
that
is
purely
a
legal
question
and
there's
no
deference
due.
in
our
view,
what
happened
here
is
that
the
plaintiffs
had
two
interrelated
legal
theories
supporting
a
legal
right,
and
such
interrelated
legal
theories
do
not
constitute
separate
claims
within
the
purview
of
rule
54
(b).
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
think
it's
a
very
similar
concept,
if
not
identical,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
this
court
in
mackey
and
in
wetzel
never
precisely
said
what
a
claim
for
relief
was.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
submit
that
a
--
that
the
court
indicated
in
wetzel
and
mackey
that
a
separate
claim
is
independent
cause
of
action
separately
enforceable
on
a
mutually
exclusive
basis
and,
by
that,
i
mean
if
the
awarding
of
relief
on
one
of
the
alleged
claims
precludes
or
obviates
the
need
for
relief
on
the
other
alleged
claim
then,
in
fact,
you
do
not
have
separate
claims
and
you
just
have
interrelated
theories.
now,
in
mackey
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
obviously,
after
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
right
and
in
wetzel,
the
fact
that
there
were
different
--
there
was
a
damage
claim,
and
an
injunctive
claim,
and
a
declaratory
relief
claim,
all
rising
out
of
one
single
legal
right,
the
court
said
that's
not
separate
claim
for
purposes
of
rule
54
(b).
similarly,
here
--
well,
in
mackey
where
they
did
hold
that
54
(b)
was
properly
used,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
could
have
recovered
on
its
antitrust
claims
and
it's
common
law
tort
claims
and
business
claims
and
unfair
competition
claims,
regardless
of
what
happened
as
to
the
antitrust
claim
and,
so,
therefore,
they
were
separate
claims.
the
rights
are
separate
and
the
recoveries
are
separate,
and
they're
not
--
one
doesn't
preclude
or
obviate
the
need
for
the
other.
here,
however,
if
our
--
if
the
district
court
had
granted
conclusively
either
one
of
plaintiffs'
legal
theories,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
address
the
legal
theory.
and,
also,
if
the
secretary,
on
re
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
that's
where
i'm
getting.
that's
my
next
point.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
their
major
submission,
as
i
see
it,
is
that
they
have
two
separate
claims.
the
first
claim
is
that
they're
complaining
about
the
stuyvesant
itself
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--
and
its
operation,
and
the
second
claim
is
that
they
have
a
right
to
know
about
the
broader
picture
or
they
allege
the
broader
picture
the
statutory
question.
and,
their
theory
is
that
even
if
the
secretary,
on
remand,
had
concluded
that
the
economic
impact
was
sufficiently
adverse
as
to
not
go
forward
with
the
stuyvesant
transaction
that
they,
nonetheless,
could
have
appealed
the
district
court's
determination
of
the
statutory
power
question
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
view,
that
ignores
the
case
requi
--
controversy
requirement
of
article
3.
certainly,
if
the
secretary
had
never
authorized
the
stuyvesant
to
operate
in
the
first
place,
you
would
have
had
an
unripe
claim.
they
could
not
have
entered
court
and
asked
for
a
declaration
as
to
the
secretary's
power
when
there
was
no
impending
use
of
that
power
and
there
was
no
decision
to
use
it.
similarly,
if
the
secretary
decided
to
withdraw
from
the
stuyvesant
transaction
and
not
go
forth
with
it,
then
you
would
have
a
situation
which
was
moot.
there
would
be
no
more
case
or
controversy
and
they
couldn't
go
forth
and
litigate
the
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
claim
of
the
statutory
power.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
judge--
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
you
can
judge
juris
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right
and,
at
that
time
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
but
neither
--
well,
the
two
legal
theories,
one
of
them
had
been
conclusively
determined
by
the
district
court
but
the
other
one
had
not,
and
the
purpose
of
rule
54
(b)
is
to
not
increase
interlocutory
appeals
of
interrelated
litigation.
it's
to
alleviate
the
hardship
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
test
to
determine
whether
we
have
truly
separate
claims
or,
as
the
courts
of
appeals
have
realized
in
other
circumstances,
interrelated
legal
theories
is
whether
or
not
the
granting
of
one
of
the
theories
would
obviate
the
need
to
get
relief
on
the
other
theory
because
if
their
--
the
relief
would
be
the
same
when
we
end
the
case,
then
there's
--
then
in
our
view,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
separate
claim.
it's
not
separate.
it's
a
related
closely
intertwined
legal
theories
and
that
is
--
that
kind
of
single
claim
multiple
theory
kind
of
litigation
is
not
subject
to
a
rule
54
(b)
certification.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
that
might
indicate
that
mootness
was
not
appropriate
in
this
particular
case,
but
here
mootness
is
clearly
an
appropriate
doctrine.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right,
well
possibly,
but
here,
the
secretary
has
used
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
yes,
if
there
were
other
transactions
already
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--
approved,
yes
that
would
be
ongoing,
but
here
the
secretary
has
used
her
power,
something
like
five
times,
in--
since
1936.
moreover,
on
the
remand,
if
it
had
determined
not
to
go
forward
with
the
claim,
it
would
have
determined
--
she
would
have
determined
that
the
economic
impact
was
sufficiently
adverse
on
the
elist
--
existing
alaskan
traders
that
the
stuyvesant
shouldn't
enter,
and
that
finding
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
i
understood
mr.
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
to
be
that
there
were
15
other
applications
granted
or
in
the
process
of
being
granted
as
the
alaskan
trade,
and
it
di
--
it
would
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
on
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
they
would
have
to
be.
i
mean,
if
the
--
i
take
it
that
even
plaintiffs
wouldn't
claim
that
they
have
any
right
to
complain
about
the
secretary's
exercise
of
power
in
a
situation
or
in
an
area
of
trade
which
they
don't
operate,
although
they
may
say
otherwise.
but
as
i
started
to
say
that
mootness
is
particularly
appropriate
in
this
case
not
only
because
the
secretary
has
so
seldomly
exercised
her
power,
which
is
the
appropriate
way
that
it
should
be
exercised,
but
also
it
is
--
the
finding
that
she
would
had
to
made
on
remand
would
have
militated
against
forever
or
in
the
reasonable
future
authorizing
any
other
ship
to
enter
the
alaskan
trade,
any
other
ship
that
was
willing
to
repay
it's
subsidy
and
become
unsubsidized.
i
want
to
address
one
point
of
the
--
on
the
merits,
if
i
might,
unless,
well
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
not
necessarily.
first
of
all,
it
would
be
vacated.
it
would
go
back
down
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
would
have
to
consider
the
findings
on
remand.
more
--
and,
it
might
actually
conclude
that
the
secretary
had
abused
her
discretion
and
enter
the
injunction
and
the
case
would
be
over.
otherwise,
it
is
possible
the
first
time
around
the
district
court
and,
implicitly,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
our
standing
claim
that
plaintiffs
do
not
have
standing,
but
i
think
that
simon
against
eastern
kentucky
welfare
rights
organization
makes
it
clear
that
you
can
judge
standing
from
two
positions;
one
at
the
pleading
stage
and,
secondly,
at
the
proof
stage.
and
here
the
remand
proceedings
demonstrate
that
at
least
some,
if
not
all,
of
trinidad
and
alaska
bulk
ships,
which
are
of
the
smaller
variety,
do
not
compete
against
the
bigger
stuyvesant
vessel
and,
therefore,
it's
possible
that
at
least
some
of
the
plaintiffs
do
not
have
standing.
moreover,
shell
points
out
in
its
brief
and
in
footnote
6,
i
believe,
that
it
has
gotten
alaskan
oil
charters
and
so,
therefore,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
its
potential
injury
would
be
either.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
exact--
absolutely
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
as
an
institutional
litigant,
the
united
states
has
a
very
great
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
final
judgment
rule
is
adhered
to,
if
at
all
possible.
i
mean,
the
united
states
is
involved
in
many
remand
decisions
and,
as
a
general
rule,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
recognized,
including
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
when
he
was
on
the
eighth
circuit
that
a
remand
decision
is
not
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
1291,
and
we
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
distinguish
from
that
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no.
i
think
it
would
vacate
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and,
therefore,
that
decision
would
not
be
the
law
of
the
circuit
any
longer
and
then
you
would
have
to
go
through
the
litigation
on
the
remand
and
it
might
be
determined
that
there
was
no
standing
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
that
was
also
the
case
in
wetzel,
your
honor,
where
everything
had
been
litigated
but
the
entry
of
the
relief
and
there
this
court
sua
sponte
vacated
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
no
direct
precedent
in
this
court,
although
i
think
that
the
boston
and
mane
railroad
case
is
very
close
in
many
aspects
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
are
uniformly
in
our
favor.
this
is
not
a
collateral
decision
of
any
sort.
this
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
the
merits.
they
will
be
easily
reviewed
on
appeal
and
there's
no
reason
to
divert
from
the
generally
accepted
rule
that
a
remand
decision
is
not
a
final
order
and
it's
not
subject
to
54
(b)
unless
there
are
separate
claims.
