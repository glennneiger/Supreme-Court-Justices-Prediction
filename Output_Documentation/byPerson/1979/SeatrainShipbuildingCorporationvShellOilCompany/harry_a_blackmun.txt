are
you
very
enthusiastic
about

mr.
mcdaniels,
let
me
ask.
is
the
solicitor
general
going
to
confine
his
argument
to
the
jurisdictional
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
it's
hard
for
us
to
get
to
the
merits
if
we
don't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
the
jurisdictional
argument
made
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
theory
but
not
economically.
justice

not
in
american
shipyards.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

the
whole
point.
