justice

stewart
do
you
think
claims
for
relief
as
used
in
rule
54
(b)
is
synonymous
with
causes
of
action?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
is
it
different?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
arguing
this
case
what
do
you
submit?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
say
pay,
it
says
claim
for
relief.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
understood
your
answer
to
be
as
it
is
tantamount
to
claim
for
relief
means
cause
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
practical
matter
the
--
isn't
my
brother
stevens
correct
that
the
--
this
would
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
and
even
though
the
district
court
then
agreed
that
the
secretary,
on
remand
to
her,
now
him
i
guess,
was
quite
right
and
it's
in
the
finding
that
by
a
--
as
to
the
competitive
situation,
but
nonetheless
under
the
compulsion
of
the
law
of
the
circuit
would
enjoin
the
secretary,
it
would
have
to.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
an
educated
guess
by
any
district
judge
as
to
what
the
law
of
the
circuit
was,
wouldn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
seatrain
would
be
right
back
up
here,
first
of
all,
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
here.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
--
obviously,
a
tanker.
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
tt
mean?
i
know
what
ss
means
and
mv,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
its
power?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
a
diesel
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
steamship
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
say
infrequent,
that's
somewhere
in
here,
that's
only
been
done
twice,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
grace
line
case
and
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
this
litigation?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
actually
been
done
only
twice;
in
the
grace
line
situation
and
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
approved.
justice
potter
stewart
initially
approved?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
this
vessel
wouldn't
exist
without
the
subsidy,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
something
like
getting
off
a
mortgage
on
a
house.
you
couldn't
own
the
house
if
they
do
not
have
the
mortgage.
justice
potter
stewart
you
represent
alaska
bulk
carriers,
incorporated.
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
you're
talking
about
the
complaint,
you're
talking
about
its
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
if
you've
mentioned
in
your
oral
argument
but
in
your
brief
you
rely
fairly
heavily
also
on
the
appealability
of
this
district
judge's
order
on
the
basis
of
the
--
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
denial
of
an
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
1292
(a)(1)
which
is
quite
a
different
and
alternative
ground
of
54.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
government's
view
is,
as
i
remember,
that
the
deletion
of
that
third
quid
pro
quo
was
inadvertence.
justice
potter
stewart
hugo
black
left
the
senate
between
1936
and
1938,
didn't
he?
and,
he
had
been
the
chairman
of
the
committee
or
subcommittee
in
1936.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
finding
was
“no
competitive
effect,”
was
it?
