mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
petitioners,
polk
and
seatrain,
were
signatories
to
a
contract
entered
into
in
june
of
1972
with
the
secretary
of
commerce,
whereby
$27.2
million
in
subsidy
was
provided
towards
the
construction
of
the
supertanker
stuyvesant.
the
issue
that
this
case
presents
involves
whether
the
secretary
of
commerce
has
the
power,
under
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936,
to
amend
that
contract
to
delete
there
from
certain
terms
restrec
--
certain
terms
restricting
the
domestic
trade
by
the
stuyvesant
in
exchange
for
a
repayment
of
the
subsidy
awarded.
the
district
court
held
that
power
existed,
but
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
the
district
court
had
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
your
honor,
mr.
levander
has
briefed
that
issue
and
would
be
arguing
it.
we
support
his
brief.
we
have
not
addressed
it
in
our
particular
briefs.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
we
did
not,
your
honor.
the
time
of
argument
has
been
divided
and,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
address
the
merits
and
mr.
levander
would
address
the
issue
of
appealability.
we
support
the
solicitor
general's
position
in
that
regard.
what
happened
was
there
was
a
remand
of
the
particular
exercise
of
this
authority
in
the
case
of
the
stuyvesant
for
further
consideration
by
the
secretary
and
prior
to
the
decision
on
remand,
the
plaintiffs
here,
shell
and
alaska
bulk,
took
appeal
of
the
issue
of
authority
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
split
decision,
decided
the
secretary
did
not
enjoy
the
authority
under
the
act.
the
stuyvesant,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court,
had
the
benefit
of
and
participation
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
directly
and
indirectly
in
its
construction
financing.
the
secretary
had
a
loaned
out
right
under
the
economic
development
administration
act,
$5
million
and
guaranteed
90%
of
other
$80
million
in
loans
which
were
used
to
refurbish
the
shipyard,
the
brooklyn
navy
yard,
where
the
vessels
were
built.
this
was
part
of
a
program
to
both
establish
a
shipyard
for
use
in
national
purposes
and,
also,
to
employ
the
hardcore
unemployed
in
that
area
and
provide
them
job
training.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
no,
i
believe
he
would
address
the
merits
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i
certainly
would,
if
you
had
some
questions
of
the
--
of
mr.
levander
on
the
question
of
appealabilities,
to
sit
down
and
have
him
argue
now
and
argue
later
on
the
merits.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i
agree,
your
honor,
but
it
was
suggested
that,
as
petitioner,
i
was
required
to
go
first
and
mr.
levander
and
i
had
discussed
it.
i
would
prefer
if
he
goes
first,
but
it's
up
to
the
court.
he's
prepared
to
address
that
issue
within
the
time
that
he
has.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i
agree.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
it
was
suggested
that,
as
petitioner
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
the
discussions
with
the
solicitor
general's
office
suggested
it
was
appropriate
that
i
go
first,
as
the
petitioner.
i
would
be
happy
to
have
mr.
levander
take
the
podium
at
this
time.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
stuyvesant
was
the
recipient
under
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936,
so
two
kinds
of
financial
assistance
in
its
construction;
one
was
a
guaranteed
loans
in
the
amount
of
$30
million
and
the
subsidy
of
$27.2
million
which
is
designed
to
equalize
the
cost
of
between
building
that
vessel
and
a
domestic
shipyard
and
what
it
would
have
cost
to
build
that
vessel
in
a
foreign
shipyard.
and,
as
a
result,
the
contract
of
cds
contained
a
provision
required
by
section
506
of
the
statute
that
the
owner
of
the
vessel
shall
agree
to
operate
that
vessel
in
the
foreign
trade
except,
incidentally,
on
the
foreign
travel
and
accept
temporarily
upon
the
consent
of
the
commission
and
with
a
limit
of
six
months
out
of
every
year
of
its
economic
life.
in
each
instance,
a
pro
rata
repayment
of
the
subsidy
would
be
required.
between
the
time
that
that
contract
was
entered
into
in
1972
and
1977,
all
foreign
trade
opportunities
for
the
vessel
were
nonexistent.
the
arab
oil
embargo
and
the
subsequent
downswing
in
the
international
market
had
rendered
there
are
no
need
for
this
vessel
in
the
foreign
trade.
at
the
same
time,
however,
there
was
a
domestic
market
that
had
developed,
the
carriage
of
oil
from
valdez,
alaska,
at
the
end
of
the
alaska
pipe
line
around
to
the
west
side
of
the
panama
canal
for
throughput
to
the
east
coast.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
this
is
a
tanker.
its'
a
225,000-deadweightton
tanker
for
the
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
tanker
--
the
other
t
escapes
me,
but
it's
a
--
vlcc
is
what
the
--
in
the
trade
it's
called
a
very
large
crude
carrier
and
it
--
perhaps
steamship
tanker
is
the
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
its
--
the
speed,
i'm
not
sure
exactly.
the
speed,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
it
was
a
diesel
and
it
has
a
capacity
of
efficiently
carrying
the
long
haul
that's
required
here
from
valdez
all
the
way
down
to
the
west
coast
of
panama
because
of
its
size
and
its
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
no,
there
are
not
many
larger.
there
are
some
in
other
registries
of
foreign
vessels
that
are
larger,
but
in
terms
of
our
vessels,
there
are
not.
the
charter
that
the
stuyvesant
was
able
to
obtain
from
sohio
was
in
the
domestic
trade
and
in
order
to
meet
that
charter,
the
vessel
would
have
to
be
freed
of
the
restrictions
in
its
contract
which
limited
it
to
six
months
out
of
every
year
and
then
with
the
consent
of
the
commission.
so
that,
in
august
of
1977,
the
petitioners
applied
to
the
secretary
for
permission
to
amend
the
contract,
to
delete
the
provisions,
and
to
repay
the
subsidy
which
had
been
provided
and
that
was
approved
on
august
30,
1977
and
the
closing
of
the
transaction
which
the
approval
formed
the
basis
of
a
rather
complicated
sales
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
transaction
of
one
of
the
vessels.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
well,
the
question
of
the
interest
in
terms
of
the
interest
between
the
time
that
subsidy
was
originally
granted
and
the
time
it
was
paid
back
was
deemed
by
the
secretary
in
her
initial
decision
not
to
be
necessary
to
be
paid
back.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
it
next
got
into
the
case,
i
guess,
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
judge
bazelon
indicated
that
he
would
require
that
to
be
paid
back.
actually
the
--
and
the
solicitor
general
has
said
in
his
papers
here
that
the
secretary
would
now
require
that
interest,
in
addition,
to
be
paid
back,
the
interest
for
that
time
period,
but
in
terms
of
--
in
the
case,
the
original
decision
by
the
secretary
was
not
to
require
that
interest
and
that
decision
was
reaffirmed
on
the
remand.
so,
at
the
moment,
the
interest
has
not
been
paid
back.
the
pama
--
the
subsidy
is
being
paid
back
in
equal
semiannual
installments
over
the
20-year-economical
life
of
the
vessel,
and
the
vessel
has
been
in
the
trade
since
september
30,
1977.
it
has
been
working
the
trade
since
that
time
when
the
preliminary
injunction
sought
here
was
denied.
the
c
--
the
authority
that
we
rely
upon,
the
secretary
relies
upon
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i
suspect,
your
honor,
that's
a
request
that
we
would
not
refuse.
if
that
was
to
be
the
position
of
the
secretary
that,
now,
that
would
be
required,
our
clients
would
acknowledge
that.
the
secretary
did
analyze
the
financial
aspects
of
it
in
remand
to
show
that
it
did
not
result
in
any
competitive
disadvantage
to
the
plaintiffs,
but
we
would
not
quarrel
with
that
requirement.
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
her
power
to
make
this
amendment
and
to
accept
subsidy
repayment
involves
the
first
instance
of
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
and,
section
504
gives
the
power
to
contract
in
the
cds
area
and
gives
with
it
necessarily
the
power
to
amend
and
terminate.
in
addition,
section
207
of
the
act
specifically
gives
the
secretary
powers
to
contract
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936
and
specifically,
further,
to
protect
and
to
preserve
or
to
improve
a
collateral
position.
we
submit
that
the
exercise
of
the
power,
if
you
look
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
fully
met
each
and
every
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
set
forth
in
section
101,
as
well
as
fully
met
a
desire
to
preserve
and
protect
and
improve
the
secretary's
collateral
position.
it
met
the
purposes
of
the
act
because
the
shipyard
was
benefited
by
the
ability
to
sell
the
vessel
and
to
have
financial
commitments
recognized.
the
vessel
itself
is
a
viable
vessel,
instead
of
going
into
layup,
it's
a
viable
vessel
with
american
built,
american
owned,
and
operated
by
american
crew
available
for
any
national
need.
the
trade
area
itself
was
in
need
of
further
tonnage
and
still
is.
there
was
an
under
supply
of
this
type
of
shipyard
tonnage
to
carry
the
alaskan
oil
and,
therefore,
the
secretary
was
able
to
address
a
need
in
the
trade
by
permitting
the
domestic
use
of
this
tanker.
furthermore,
her
collateral
position
was
protected.
first
of
all,
the
secretary
will
receive
back
$27.2
million
that,
obviously,
would
not
otherwise
have
to
be
repaid
since
at
the
outset
it
was
a
direct
subsidy
grant.
in
addition,
there
are
$28.6
million
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
went
immediately
to
discharge
loans
on
--
which
the
secretary
guaranteed
under
eda.
so,
$28.6
million
went
directly
to
discharge
those
guaranteed
loans.
in
addition,
the
$30
million
of
title
11
assistance
which
was
guaranteed
loans,
which
was
increased
to
additional
$30
million
at
the
closing,
received
an
improved
collateral
position
because
the
vessel
was
a
viable
vessel
in
a
trade
earning
charter
rate.
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
this
--
the
statutory
construction
question
is
aided
by
the
principle
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
would
be
given
great
weight
if
it
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
should
be
accorded
unless
there
are
compelling
indications
that
it's
wrong,
particularly
whereas
here,
the
secretary's
interpretation
has
been
longstanding.
it
was
first
done
in
1964
in
the
grace
line
decision.
it's
been
consistently
spoken
about
by
the
secretary
ever
since,
both
in
terms
of
other,
although
infrequent,
applications
for
this
relief
and
its
messages
to
congress.
and
it
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
the
first
time
was
around
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes,
there
have
been
applications
that
have
been
--
three
other
applications,
your
honor,
that
have
also
received
approval
for
this
to
be
done,
but
are
contingent
upon,
in
two
of
them
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
no.
they're
contingent
upon
the
virgin
islands
if
that
were
to
become
part
of
the
domestic
trade,
which
it
is
not
now
then
the
particular
vessels
involved
would
be
free
of
their
restrictions.
so
it's
contingent
upon
certain
events
happening
in
the
future,
but
the
principle
has
been
recognized
and
accorded
full
value,
but
that's
just
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes,
and
the
three
other
times,
it's
been
approved
but
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
future
events
are
contingent
upon
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes.
and,
the
power
is
well
known
in
the
industry.
it's
been
spoken
of
before
congress
by
industry
spokesman,
as
well
as
the
legislators
themselves
and
this
particular
power
survived
the
amendment
of
the
statute
in
1970
and
has
been
specifically
been
called
to
the
attention
of
congress
twice
in
1972
and
again
in
1978.
and,
i
think
the
1972
history
is
most
important
because
in
1972
congress
specifically
enacted
positive
legislation
to
facilitate
the
secretary
in
granting
trade
release
restrictions
--
release
the
trade
restrictions
and
repayment
of
the
subsidy
because
it
amended
title
11
to
provide
guaranteed
financing.
in
the
cases
of
an
applicant
who
seeks
to
repay
like
$27.2
million
to
gain
trade
restriction
release.
as
ultimately
enacted,
the
bill
was
broadened
to
include
financing
of
any
repayment
of
subsidy,
including
the
more
common
repayment
pursuant
to
the
temporary
release
authorized
by
section
506,
but
it's
clear
that
the
grace
line
precedent
was
called
to
the
attention
of
congress.
congress
not
only
did
not
disapprove
of
it
but
specifically
granted
positive
legislation
facilitating
its
exercise.
now,
in
light
of
these
aspects
and
canons
of
statutory
construction,
there
is
not
in
this
case
any
compelling
indication,
either
in
the
language
of
the
act
or
its
history
or
its
purposes,
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
wrong.
the
language
which
the
plaintiffs
rely
upon
is
section
506
of
the
act
which
provides
for
when
a
vessel
can
enter
the
domestic
trade
while
it
retains
its
subsidy.
we
submit
that
that
section,
by
its
very
language,
has
no
application
to
a
vessel
such
as
the
stuyvesant
which
has
repaid
its
subsidy.
there's
nothing
in
that
section
that
precludes
the
secretary
from
exercising
the
power
here,
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
this
action
is
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
act.
in
1936,
senator
hugo
black,
at
that
time,
issued
the
report
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
act.
his
report
to
congress
indicated
that
the
secretary
should
have
this
power.
each
of
the
framers
of
the
statute
indicated
that
the
secretary
should
have
this
power.
and,
the
1936
act
itself
contained
language
which
described
this
power
in
section
506
wherein
it
indicated
that
the
secretary
could
do
this
upon
her
consent.
the
plaintiffs
and
the
court
of
appeals
rely
heavily
on
the
1938
legislative
history
wherein
that
descriptive
language
which
i
have
described
was
removed
from
the
statute.
it
was
deleted.
this,
however,
was
done
and
the
legislative
history
speaks
only
to
it
being
done
in
the
context
of
addressing
a
totally
separate
problem
whether
or
not
there
would
be
required
for
any
and
all
partial
returns,
any
and
all
temporary
returns
the
repayment
of
subsidy.
the
--
chairman
kennedy,
who
presented
the
amendment,
said
that
there
was
an
ambiguity
in
the
1936
statute.
the
only
ambiguity
in
that
statute,
upon
analysis,
is
that
it
seem
--
it
appears
to
permit
the
subsidized
vessel
to
return
to
the
trade
for
a
period
of
three
months
and
not
have
to
remit
any
pro
rata
share
of
the
previous
subsidy.
this
section
was
entirely
rewritten
in
1938
and,
as
rewritten,
it
makes
the
matter
of
trade
restrictions
a
contractual
term
to
which
the
owner
shall
agree.
we
submit
to
the
court
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
that
omission
of
the
language
was
done
with
the
intention
of
depriving
the
secretary
of
the
power
she's
exercised
here.
not
one
word
of
such
intent
was
--
is
in
the
legislative
history
and,
indeed,
the
people
from
the
industry,
who
spoke
about
the
amendment
at
the
time,
considered
the
amendment
to
increase
the
opportunity
for
competition
between
subsidized
vessels
and
nonsubsidized
vessels,
rather
than
decreasing
it.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes
sir?
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes.
the
--
prior
to
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936,
subsidies
for
the
foreign
trade
had
been
done
indirectly
by
virtue
of
the
mail
subsidy
route
where
that
--
the
government
would
subsidize
the
carriage
of
mail
and
that
was
a
problem
because
a
carrier
who
could
be
carrying
the
mail
with
subsidy
would
also
be
involved
in
the
domestic
trade.
that
was
found
to
be
an
inadequate
and
improper
way
of
subsidizing
vessels
for
the
foreign
trade.
so,
the
concept
of
subsidy
had
existed
before,
but
the
particular
construction,
differential
subsidy
program,
the
direct
outright
grant
began
in
1936.
and,
i
submit
that
this
is
actually
the
main
focus
of
congress
throughout,
was
to
prevent
there
being
simultaneously
a
vessel
that
has
a
subsidy
competing
with
vessels
that
do
not
have
subsidies.
that
the
only
competition
that
was
a
concern
to
congress
was
competition
by
a
vessel
which
still
retained
its
subsidy
which
--
with
other
vessels
which
had
not
been
built
with
subsidy
and
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
necessarily
so.
the
vessel
could
have
been
built
without
the
subsidy.
in
fact,
it
was
built
with
the
subsidy.
it
may
well
be
that
it
is
a
--
contained
certain
features
that
it
would
not
have
had
other
than
a
subsidy,
but
you
could,
in
theory,
build
this
vessel
without
subsidy.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
well,
there
are
vessels
bigger
than
this
that
are
built
certainly
in
other
countries
and
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
no.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
correct.
well,
the
vessel,
in
terms
of
its
economic
burden,
however,
bears
it
now
and
that
is
to
say,
by
virtue
of
requiring
it
of
the
repayment
of
subsidy,
it
stands
in
the
same
position
as
it
would
if
it
had
made
the
decision
to
build
the
vessel,
including
the
$27
million.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
no,
but
the
difference,
your
honor,
is,
in
terms
of
the
problem
of
competition,
it's
just
as
if
the
vessel
had
been
financed
by
a
loan
and
that
that
loan
is
being
paid
off.
as
far
as
its
competitive
impact,
it's
as
if
this
vessel,
the
original
decision
was
to
make
a
domestic
vessel
this
size
at
this
cost
because
that's
the
economic
burden
that
the
vessel
carries
at
this
time.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i
would
agree
that
the
burden
on
the
vessel
is
the
same.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i
do
feel
it's
the
same
that
the
--
it's
as
if
the
vessel
had
been
constructed
with
the
aid
of
financing
in
the
amount
of
$27.2
million
instead
of
a
subsidy
because,
in
planning
a
charter
rate
for
the
vessel,
it
now
must
contemplate
servicing
that
debt.
so,
it's
the
same
as
if,
instead
of
having
a
subsidy
in
the
first
instance,
there
had
been
a
loan
in
that
amount
which
it
now
must
consider
when
it
services
its
debt.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
that's
correct.
it's
service
in
the
foreign
trade,
and
what
that
quid
pro
quo
no
longer
applies,
that
is
when
the
subsidy
is
paid
back,
the
reason
for
the
quid
pro
quo
no
longer
exists
either.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
no,
you
cannot.
i
thought
the
question
was
in
terms
of
the
economic
burden
of
this
vessel.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
certainly,
it's
--
it
would
require
the
agreement
of
the
secretary
to
pay
back
the
subsidy.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
under
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
secretary
must
consider
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
one
of
the
facts
that
you
consider
is
competitive
impact.
that's
not
the
only
one
because
there
are
a
number
of
others
that
are
concerned
to
her
protecting
her
collateral.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
he
does
because
his
decision
in
that
regard
would
be
reviewable
on
whether
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
the
findings
would
be
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
the
purpose
of
the
reason
for
making
the
repayment,
protecting
collateral,
servicing
a
trade,
making
a
viable
vessel
available
for
national
emergency,
and
the
competitive
effect.
that
is
one
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes,
i
understood
that
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
unless
there
was
a
prepayment
or
with
or
without
payment.
i
understood
the
thrust
of
the
chief
justice's
question
to
be
whether
or
not
the
vessel
competitively
sits
as
if
it
had
received
on
day
one
a
$27.2
million
loan
from
chase
manhattan
as
opposed
to
a
subsidy
and,
in
that
respect
it
is
the
same
because
it
is
re-servicing
the
repayment
of
that
debt
at
the
present
time.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i
agree.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
then
i
took
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
it
is
and
i
took
the
chief
justice's
question
to
mean
that
you
were
concerned
whether
there
was
some
benefit
that
the
party
receives
that
he
wouldn't
have
received
if
he
had
had
a
loan
in
the
first
instance
instead
of
a
subsidy.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i
think
that
it
could.
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
difficult
burden
for
the
person
who
is
seeking
the
exercise
of
the
discretionary
authority
to
achieve
the
standard
to
reverse
it,
arbitrary
and
capricious
i
think
it
would
be
subject
to
review.
in
particular,
the
secretary
has
now
indicated
that
it
will
be
promulgating
rules
setting
out
these
factors
for
applications
in
the
future.
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
couple
moments
for
rebuttal,
if
there
are
no
any
further
questions
at
this
time.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
statute
clearly
sets
forth
the
kinds
of
findings
that
the
secretary
must
consider
when
it
says
in
207
that
she
may
contract
consistent
with
purposes
of
the
act,
it's
also
set
forth
in
101,
and
to
protect
and
preserve
her
collateral
in
which
she
did
here.
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
bind
the
secretary
where,
in
the
one
hand,
you
give
her
the
power
to
invest
$70
million
of
the
taxpayers'
money
to
say
she
can
never
react
to
the
volatile
trading
circumstances
that
could
concur
in
the
maritime
trade.
she
must
have
this
flexibility.
and,
with
respect
to
the
1938
history,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
key
there
is
this
language
that
mr.
kennedy
proposed
was
set
at
the
same
time
that
he
says
we
have
no
intent
to
change
the
original
purpose
of
the
section.
the
original
purpose
of
the
section
was
to
remain
the
same.
it
clearly
countenance
the
right
to
have
permanent
payback,
and
the
fact
that,
since
1936
and
1938
and,
clearly,
since
1964,
the
unsubsidized
carriers
have
realized
that
this
possibility
existed.
they
proposed
--
the
unsubsidized
carriers
proposed
legislation
to
permanently
ban
forever
a
subsidized
vessel
from
ever
coming
into
the
domestic
trade.
congress
has
never
done
that.
congress
has
never
passed
that
legislation.
instead,
the
statutory
scheme
permits
a
half
of
the
life,
10
years
of
the
vessel's
life
while
subsidized,
can
be
spent
in
direct
competition
with
the
subsidized
vessels.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
six-month
period.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
and
that's
more
dangerous
to
their
interest,
frankly,
because
you
could
pick
and
choose
as
your
foreign
carrier
the
six
months
you
want.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
here
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
if
she'll
let
you,
exactly.
but,
in
this
case,
we're
committed
as
of
domes
--
we
are
now
a
jones
act
carrier,
always
have
been,
the
same
as
they
are,
we
are
now
committed
to
the
domestic
trade
to
take
the
ups
and
downs.
they're
still
in
business.
we're
still
in
business.
they
still
have
a
market
and
we
still
have
a
market.
there
is
no
sense
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
in
the
history
that
there
was
to
be
freedom
from
competition
from
the
vessel,
only
freedom
from
unfair
competition.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
because
the
return
of
the
subsidy
makes
us
a
vessel
which
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
yes,
but
i
can
go
--
we
can
go
in
the
foreign
trade
as
well,
but
we
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
well,
we
stand
at
equal
f
--
competitive
footing
with
them.
i
--
i
feel
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
exactly,
but
we
cannot
compete
in
the
foreign
trade
with
the
benefit
of
subsidy.
so,
we're
--
in
terms
of
our
trading
options,
the
domestic
trade
has
to
be
the
first
opportunity.
we're
not
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
which,
is
a
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
we
cannot
return
to
a
subsidized
state.
we
must
compete
on
the
par
with
the
unsubsidized
vessels.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i
--
consistent
with
it?
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
absolutely
consistent
with
it
because
the
strong
merchant
marine
would
not
have
been
served
at
this
vessel
and
its
capacities
were
put
into
dry
dock
and
not
available
or
you
--
keeping
of
a
viable
vessel,
american-built
and
owned,
with
an
american
crew
is
a
primary
goal
of
the
merchant
marine
act,
particularly
when
it
causes
no
adverse
competitive
effect
to
the
unsubsidized
carrier
which
is
the
situation
here
based
on
all
the
findings
in
the
case.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
well,
they
must
but,
your
honor,
they
are
in
the
trade.
they
still
have
their
charters.
they're
still
doing
business
and
there
still
is
a
need
for
further
vessels
in
the
trade.
so,
there
has
been
a
finding
of
no
adverse
competitive
effect
by
this
transaction.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
and
they
are
free
from
that
in
this
case
because
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
you're
no
longer
such
a
ship.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
but
we
couldn't
compete
with
them
at
that
time,
except
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
which
has
never
been
--
ever
been
--
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
because
the
procedure
was
posted
in,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
mcdaniels
it
was
a
non
--
a
minimal
competitive
effect
by
the
secretary
upon
remand.
thank
you.
