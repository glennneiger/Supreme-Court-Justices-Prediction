e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
seatrain
shipbuilding
corporation
against
shell
oil
company.
mr.
mcdaniels,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
your
case.
we'll
allow
you
to
make
the
decision,
but
as
my
colleagues
have
suggested,
it's
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
a
little.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levander.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
we'll
return
to
you,
mr.
mcdaniels.

this
happened
when
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
happened
when,
mr.
mcdaniels,
did
the
question
obtained
interest
on
the
rebates
arise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
who
--
then,
next,
how
did
that
get
into
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
--
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
challenge
the
idea
that
the
payment
of
interest
might
be
a
reasonable
or
sensible
administrative
decision.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
matter
of
economics,
business
economics,
is
there
situation
in
your
view
essentially
the
same
as
though
that
chase
manhattan
had
financed
by
a
lien
on
the
ship
the
precise
amount
that
was
given
by
way
of
the
subsidy
here
with
conditions
imposed
by
chase
manhattan,
as
it
would
be
in
the
lien,
and
now,
they
have
exercised
the
right
for
an
accelerated
payoff?
it's
--
would
you
say,
economically,
the
situation
is
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
asserting
it.
i'm
asking
your
view
of
it
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
quid
pro
quo
for
the
subsidy
are
the
conditions
which
the
federal
government
attaches
on
it,
going
back
into
the
history
of
our
merchant
marine,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
was
limited
to
the
economic
aspects.
the
chase
manhattan
hasn't
any
interest
in
preserving
an
independent
merchant
or
a
viable
merchant
marine
which
the
government
has.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
difference.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
why
the
secretary
retains
that
control,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
klein.
you
can
lower
the
lectern
there
if
you
push
with
the
handle.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
it's
a
permanent
relationship.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
like
the
mark
of
cain
on
this
vessel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
the
taxpayers'
money.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mrs.
klein.
mr.
shulman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
six
months
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
six
months
off,
and
six
months
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
six
months
off?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
indefinitely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
proper
findings
were
made.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
could
do
that
in
definitely
if
the
necessary
findings
were
made,
but
those
findings
could
be
challenged
in
a
judicial
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
sense,
it
would
depend
to
some
extent
on
which
six
months
and
what
tanker
market
conditions
were
at
the
time,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcdaniels.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
about
10
years
in
these
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
upon
s
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
secretary
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
their
claim,
in
part
at
least,
is
that
they
should
be
free
from
competition
from
federally
financed
enterprises.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
initially,
it
was
federally
financed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
