doesn't
it
also
present
a
jurisdictional
issue
of
how
the
case
ever
got
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
a
rather
odd
distribution
of
time
to,
first,
argue
the
merits
when
there's
a
question
of
dis
--
of
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
federal
court
has
to
take
note
of
it
on
its
own
motion,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levander,
on
my
colleague
stevens'
hypothesis,
there
were
15
or
16
foreseeable
claims
in
the
future.
to
avoid
mootness,
you
would
not
only
have
to
have
that
but
you
would
have
to
have
them
by
the
same
plaintiffs,
would
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
p
--
they
had
the
same
impact
on
the
plaintiffs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
another
practical
consequence
of
your
prevailing
on
your
jurisdictional
claim
be
that
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
and
litigants
would
be
much
more
careful
of
the
rules
that
this
court
is
promulgated
as
to
when
a
case
can
be
appealed
and
when
it
can't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcdaniels
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
is
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936
the
b
--
the
original
act
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
not
without
a
provision
for
granting
right
for
prepaying.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
if
this
--
if
the
par
t--
if
the
recipient
of
the
subsidy,
tenders
back
the
subsidy
to
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
refuses
the
tender,
that
action
could
be
refu
--
reviewed
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
to
whether
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
the
theory
that
you
advanced
on
behalf
of
the
--
is
it,
what,
bay
ridge
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
be
the
s
--
substantially
the
same
as
that
which
you
advanced
on
behalf
of
the
stuyvesant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
really
wouldn't
have
been
a
necessarily
a
different
claim,
would
it?
wouldn't
it
have
been
just
a
different
theory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
one
have
been
granted
without
--
could
the
injunction
have
been
granted
without
the
lesser
included
relief
been
--
having
been
granted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
have
gotten
the
result
you
wanted,
but
you
couldn't
have
gotten
it
by
the
injunctive
relief
in
a
general
injunction
against
the
secretary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
it
have
been
possible
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
if
the
secretary
had
come
back
and
said
“i've
corrected
whatever
defects
the
district
court
found”
for
the
district
court
to
had
--
nonetheless
have
enjoined
the
secretary
from
doing
what
she
proposed
to
do
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
have
been
in
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
for
her
to
have
done
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
the
bay
ridge
was
still
on
the
drawing
board.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
what
it
is
criticizing
or
was
that
what
he
wanted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
another
ambiguity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
--
will
you
say
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
that's
contrary
to
the
declaration
of
congress
that
the
welfare
of
the
country
depends
on
a
strong
merchant
marine.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
