justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
--
if
you
had
--
if
you
had
borrowed
from
a
private
source,
usually,
a
lease
with
a
penalty,
you
can
pay
it
off,
you
have
the
right
to
pay
it
off.
are
you
suggesting
that
you
have
the
right
to
pay
back
the
subsidy
if
the
secretary
doesn't
want
you
--
want
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
the
secretary
who
has
to
agree
to
accept
it
and
also
make
these
findings
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
about
this
competitive
impact?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
contest
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
secretary
just
can't
say
“by
the
way,
i'd
like
to
have
that
money
back”
and
you
just
pay
it.
he
has
to
make
some
findings.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
were
a
chase
loan,
chase
could
take
the
money
and
the
borrower
could
pay
it
no
matter
what
the
competitive
impact
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
there
certainly
was
a
controversy
between
you
and
the
federal
parties,
although
there
may
not
have
been
a
controversy
between
you
and
seatrain.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
--
do
you
think
there
was
a
controversy
between
you
and
seatrain
on
that
second
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
were
asking
for
the
injunction
against
the
federal
party
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
--
and
you're
--
and
all
you
need
is
to
say
it
was
a
case
of
controversy
between
you
and
the
federal
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
whatever
happened
on
remand,
unless
the
district
court
changed
its
mind,
you
are
out
of
business
on
your
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
--
did
he
submit
a
draft
with
it
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
“and
i
want
it
--“
justice
byron
r.
white
“and
i
want
it
rewritten
as
attached.”
justice
byron
r.
white
he
submit
a
draft
or
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
language
out
or
was
it
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
infers
that
somebody
besides
the
chairman
had
written
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
largely.
justice
byron
r.
white
two-thirds
--
justice
byron
r.
white
two-thirds
at
least.
[luaghter]
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
temporary?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
ships
aren't
usable
in
foreign
commerce,
there
can
be
at
least
temporary
use
in
the
domestic
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
are
some
findings.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
there
has
to
be
some
refund
of
the
subsidy?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
secretary
could
string
temporary
exemptions
together
as
long
as
--
each
time
he
made
another
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
unfair
agreement
in
this
–
what
--
why
would
you--
why
are
you
saying
you're
locked
in
the
domestic
trade?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
makes
you
free
to
go
into
domestic
trade.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
–
that
--
but
you
indicated
you
couldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
would
--
you
have
your
options
and
now
you
have
--
you
can
sail
on
either
trade.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
locked
into
competing
without
a
subsidy.
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
wherever
in
either
trade.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
but,
so,
adverse
competitive
effect,
i
would
be
spending
--
after
spending
quite
a
bit
of
money
and
effort
--
i
s
--
litigating
this
case,
they
must
think
that
it
hurts
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
been
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
been
an
administrative
finding
but
it's
never
been
reviewed.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
been
an
administrative
finding
of
no
competitive
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
been
here.
