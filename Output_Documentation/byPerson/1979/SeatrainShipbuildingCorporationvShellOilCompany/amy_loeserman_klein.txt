ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
commenced
its
jurisdictional
argument
by
filing
briefs
in
this
court
which
almost
didn't
address
the
issue
of
rule
54
(b).
the
initial
government
briefs
on
the
jurisdiction
were
all
addressed
to
the
finality
issue
as
that
concept
is
understood
under
28
u.s.c.,
1291.
in
our
reply
briefs,
we
focus
the
argument
on
rule
54
(b)
because
it
was
a
rule
54
(b)
order
that
was
entered
by
the
district
court
and
because
our
complaint
so
clearly
asked
for
relief
more
than
the
mere
barring
of
the
stuyvesant.
the
government
initially
made
its
final
order
argument
purely
on
the
supposition
that
the
only
relief
that
the
plaintiffs
below
had
asked
for
was
the
barring
of
the
stuyvesant,
and
the
government
said
“you
had
two
theories
for
that.”
you
had
a
theory
that
the
--
there
was
no
power
to
wave
the
stuyvesant
into
the
domestic
trades
and
you
had
a
theory
that
if
there
was
power,
the
competitive
effect
was
such
that
the
power
shouldn't
be
exercised.
and,
we
said
“no,
that
isn't
our
complaint.
you've
rewritten
our
complaint.”
what
our
complaint
said
was
that
the
stuyvesant
should
not
be
in
the
domestic
trades
because
the
secretary
has
no
power
and,
for
other
reasons,
they
were
claims
of
violations
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
we
also
said
that
the
secretary
has
no
power
to
waive
any
vessel
built
with
subsidy
into
the
domestic
trades.
and,
we
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
that
effect
and
we
asked
for
an
injunction
to
that
effect,
and
we
referred
in
our
complaint
to
the
bay
ridge
which
is
the
sister
ship
of
the
stuyvesant,
built
by
the
same
interests,
nearing
completion
as
to
which
we
allege
that
if
the
power
to
waive
the
section
506
bar
were
upheld
for
the
stuyvesant,
that
they
would
be
a
similar
exercise
for
the
bay
ridge
because
the
bay
ridge
was
also
built
with
subsidy.
they
were--
the
same
government
collateral
at
risk.
there
was
heavy
government
loan
guarantees
from
the
economic
development
administration.
and,
we
asked
for
an
injunction
barring
the
exercise
of
the
waiver
power
for
the
bay
ridge
and
for
any
other
vessel
ever
built
with
construction
differential
subsidy.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
that's
correct,
and
trinidad.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
that's
correct,
sir.
so
that,
not
only
is
there
a
hypothetical
of
15
or
16
ships
in
the
wings,
but
there
was
an
actuality
one
that
was
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
and,
as
has
already
been
made
clear,
these
are
huge
vessels
and
one
may
be
considered
an
equivalent
perhaps
of
the
15
or
16
hypothetical
in
a
different
situation.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
yes.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
so
far
as
the
waiver
is
concerned,
yes,
identical,
that
the
secretary
--
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
no,
it
would
not
have
been
a
different
theory.
what
we
said
was
that
the
secretary
had
no
power
to
waive
the
section
506
bar,
and
the
relief
that
we
asked
for
was
an
injunction
going
against
the
stuyvesant
and
an
injunction
going
against
the
exercise
of
that
waiver
authority
for
any
other
vessel
ever
built
with
cds.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
an
injunction
could
have
been
issued
against
the
stuyvesant
for
the
reason
of
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
was
also
alleged
in
our
complaint
and
eventually
sustained
by
the
district
court.
that
was
the
reason
for
the
remand.
the
district
court
found
a
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
so,
the
stuyvesant
could
have
been
barred
for
reasons
going
to
issues
involved
in
the
remand,
but
the
general
injunction
against
waiver
of
the
power
for
any
vessel
could
only
be
granted
upon
the
determination
as
to
statutory
authority
and,
that
was
the
determination
made
by
the
district
court.
so
that
once
the
district
court
decided
that
the
secretary
had
the
disputed
authority,
the
issue
as
to
our
entitlement
for
an
injunction,
as
to
the
bay
ridge
and
all
other
vessels
in
that
class
was
finally
and
irrevocably
decided.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
we
could
not
have
gotten
the
relief
we
sought,
which
was
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
secretary
lacked
the
disputed
authority.
that
was
finally
decided
against
us.
the
only
thing
we
could
have
gotten
was
that
the
exercise
of
that
authority
with
respect
to
the
stuyvesant
was
invalid.
i
think
that
we
finally
convinced
the
government
that
our
complaint
said
what
we
said
it
said
instead
of
what
they
said
it
said
because,
on
the
reply
briefs,
the
government
moved
away
from
the
claim
--
from
the
contention
that
we
only
advance
one
claim
for
relief
which
was
to
bar
the
stuyvesant,
and
the
government
said
that
we
had
no
right
to
ask
for
anything
other
than
the
barring
of
the
stuyvesant
because
we
weren't
presenting
the
judiciary
with
the
case
of
controversy
under
article
3.
and,
the
reason
for
that
was
said
to
be
that
we
were
asking
for
something
that
wasn't
concrete.
that
we
had
to
wait
as
each
vessel
was
waived
into
the
fleet
and
we
had
to
bring
the
same
lawsuit
and
if
we
didn't
get
the
vessel,
the
waiver
set
aside
for
some
other
reason,
then
and
only
then
could
we
focus
on
the
statutory
authority.
and,
with
respect,
we
think
that
the
issue
is
a
question
of
rightness,
the
case
of
controversy
issue.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
absolutely,
1292
(a)(1).
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
that's
correct.
we
think
that
it's
--
it
was
clearly
appealable
under
either
one.
it
was
a
final
denial
of
an
injunction.
nothing
that
happened
on
remand
could
possibly
have
altered
the
decision
below
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
an
injunction
barring
the
waiver
of
any
vessel
built
into
c
--
with
cds
into
the
domestic
merchant
union.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
that's
correct.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
well,
we
posed
the
waiver
of
the
bay
ridge
--
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
but
the
injunction
was
asked
against
the
government,
yes,
sir.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
unquestionably,
yes.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
yes,
we
could
have
conceivably
gotten
an
injunction
against
the
stuyvesant
but
we
could
not
have
gotten
an
injunction
against
the
exercise,
we
couldn't
have
gotten
our
declaratory
judgment
that
the
secretary
lacked
the
power.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
that's
correct,
but
our
complaint
made
very
clear,
pointed
out,
and
it
was
a
substantial
part
of
our
entire
case
that
the
mere
exercise
of
the
power,
the
mere
--
or
to
say
it,
the
mere
affirmation
of
the
power
has
an
immediate
impact
upon
us,
upon
our
industry,
upon
the
unsubsidized
domestic
merchant
marine.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
well,
that's
correct.
that's
correct
and
we
have
--
we
are
in
a
totally
different
trade,
as
it
were,
that
was
our
complaint.
we
are
in
a
different
trade.
we
have
assets
that
are
worth
a
different
amount
than
they
were
before
the
secretary
said
that
she
had
the
power.
we
have
a
whole
different
growth
situation
before
the
secretary
said
that
she
had
the
power.
and,
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
our
complaint
will
show
that
we
were
at
least
as
much,
or
even
more,
concerned
about
the
secretarial
interpretation
that,
at
any
point
in
time,
the
secretary
could
waive
into
the
unsubsidized
merchant
marine
into
the
domestic
trade
a
--
vessels
built
with
subsidy,
at
any
time,
sim
--
merely
by
consenting
to
the
repayment
of
the
unamortized
subsidy.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
that's
correct.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
it
can
be
looked
at
that
way,
but
there
is
also
an
argument
that
there
was
a
separate
right
of
appeal
under
1292
(a)
(1)
irrespective
of
whether
we
were
asking
for
more
than
one
--
we
had
more
than
one
claim
for
relief.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
we
think
so
--
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
--
because,
under
1292
(a)
(1),
we
were
finally
denied
an
injunction
as
to
this
class
of
vessels
and
nothing
can
change
that.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
petitioners'
statutory
construction
rests
upon
the
conception
that
this
statute
establishes
a
quid
pro
quo
relationship
and
that's
the
key.
that's
the
theme
that
the
statute
carries
out.
if
subsidy
is
retained,
there
is
a
restriction
against
trading
--
domestic
trading.
once
subsidy
is
returned,
it
is
said
that
the
restriction
dissolves.
we
think
that
that
isn't
what
the
statute
says.
while
there
is
some
quid
pro
quo
relationship,
it
is
not
an
open-ended
quid
pro
quo
relationship.
the
statute
says
that
subsidy
is
given
for
operation
in
foreign
trade.
the
statute
has
two
exceptions
to
that;
incidental
domestic
trading
and
domestic
trading,
purely
domestic
trading
for
no
longer
than
six
months.
if
those
two
exceptions
--
if
the
vessel
engages
in
those
two
exceptions,
the
vessel
must
return
subsidy
pro
re
nata,
that
is
the
extent
of
the
quid
pro
quo
relationship.
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
trading
other
than
foreign
is
limited,
but
there
is
no
open-ended
statutory
scheme
whereby
a
vessel
operator
can
decide
to
go
into
any
trade
other
than
the
ones
that
he's
--
that
subsidy
was
given
for
merely
by
repaying
subsidy.
now,
petitioners,
in
effect,
acknowledge
that.
they
don't
say
that
“well,
you
can
go
into
any
incidental
trade,
for
example,
other
than
the
enumerated
four
incidental
trades.”
they
don't
say
you
can
go
into
domestic
trade
for
eight
months.
they
say
there's
only
one
other,
one-third
example
where
you
can
go
into
where
the
quid
pro
quo
relationship
is
carried
out.
and,
that
third
example
is,
they
say,
that
if
you
return
all
the
subsidy
or
the
unamortized
subsidy
at
any
point
during
a
vessel's
life,
then
the
restriction
just
dissolves.
now,
the
first
two
quid
pro
quo
relationships
are
found
directly
in
the
statute.
the
third
one
is
not
found
in
the
statute,
but
the
petitioners
say
that's
okay.
it
should
be
implied
into
the
statute
and
the
reason
it
should
be
implied
into
the
statute
is
because
it
carries
out
the
quid
pro
quo
theme,
but
the
quid
pro
quo
theme
itself
is
a
concoction,
we
submit,
of
petitioners.
there
is
no
general
quid
pro
quo
theme
and,
indeed,
they
acknowledge
that.
moreover,
the
fact
that
there
are
two
instances
in
which
a
vessel
built
with
subsidy
can
engage
in
the
in
--
other
than
foreign
trades
upon
a
repayment
of
subsidy
clearly
doesn't
imply
this
third
quid
pro
quo
relationship
that
the
petitioners
have
concocted
for
the
reason
that
it
was
the
very
category
of
instances
that
unquestionably
was
taken
out
of
the
act
in
1938
when
the
statute
was
rewritten.
all
parties
here
agree
that
the
1936
act,
the
act
as
originally
enacted,
had
a
section
506
that
might
be
interpreted
as
establishing
precisely
these
three
quid
pro
quo
relationships,
but
in
1938,
unquestionably,
that
third
quid
pro
quo
came
out
of
the
statute.
now
petitioners
here
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
the
1936
act,
but
the
1936
act
isn't
the
law
anymore.
it
is
the
1938
amendment
that's
the
law,
and
--
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
that's
what
they
say.
we
have
cited
the
legislative
history
chapter
and
verse
to
show
it
was
not
only
an
inadvertence.
the
section
was
rewritten
at
the
request
of
the
then
chairman
of
the
maritime
commission,
chairman
kennedy,
joseph
kennedy,
who
said
“we
find
it
confusing
to
have
these
two
consents
which
we
could
give,
one
for
unlimited
operation
for
return
of
subsidy
and
another
for
temporary
emergency,”
we
find
that
confusing,
and
take
out
this
third
instance,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
congress
--
that's
exactly
what
the
congress
did.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
that's
right.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
he
--
well,
i
suppose
not.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
he
said
it's
ambiguous
and
confusing.
and
then,
he
said
how
the
sent
--
how
the
section
should
be
rewritten
and,
as
rewritten,
it
was
taken
out.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
he
said
“we
find
the
two
consents
that
we
are
empowered
to
give
ambiguous
and
confusing
and
we
want
the
section
rewritten
so
that
the
total
payout
is
taken
out”
and
that's
--
that
was
the
language
he
proposed
and
that
was
the
language
that
was
enacted.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
no.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
no.
if
i
did,
i
overreached
myself.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
yes.
he
said
“as
the
section
is
rewritten”--
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
--
which
is
taken
out.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
as
the
section
is
rewritten.
i
can't
be
sure
of
that,
no,
your
honor.
he
said
--
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
i
believe
he
did,
but
i
can't
be
sure
of
that.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
the
--
when
the
amendment
was
introduced,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
said
“this
has
been
rewritten
wholly
in
the
light
of
the
suggestions
of
the
maritime
commission.”
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
and
he
said
“and
largely
in
the
words
of
the
maritime
commission.”
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
i
think
we
have
the
exact
quote
in
our
brief
--
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
but,
yes
--
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
yes.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
yes?
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
no,
i
don't
think
we
have
to.
i
think
we
can
rely
just
on
the
statute
that
says
that
you're
supposed
to
have
subsidy
for
the
foreign
trade
and
that's
the
only
purpose
for
which
you
can
give
subsidy.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
no.
i
think
that
the
carrying
out
of
the
legislative
intent
is
that
you
take
the
subsidy
and
you
fulfill
the
contract.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
so
the
lower
court
found
after
very
extensive
analysis,
yes.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
that
is
true.
that
is
what
the
vessel
was
built
for.
that
is
why
the
aids
were
extended.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
with
taxpayers'
money.
ms.
amy
loeserman
klein
yes.
thank
you.
