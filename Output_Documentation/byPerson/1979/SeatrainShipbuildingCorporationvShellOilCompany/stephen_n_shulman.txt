mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
pick
up
one
or
two
points
with
regard
to
the
jurisdictional
question
that
strike
me
as
still
hanging
a
little
bit.
one
was
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
whether
or
not
there
was
still
a
case
or
controversy
or
there
would
still
be
a
case
or
controversy
vis-à-vis
seatrain.
and,
previously
to
that,
there
had
been
questions
raised
as
to
what
will
happen
if
there
were
15
or
16
ships
in
the
wings,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
stevens
raised
that
question.
the
important
point
to
remember
is
that
the
stuyvesant
itself
was
standing
in
the
wings
because
with
the
only
relief
that
could
be
gotten,
injunctively,
given
the
district
court's
order,
what
you
will
have
was
an
injunction
against
the
stuyvesant
then
based
upon
the
competitive
conditions
then
and
there
could
have
been
a
new
attempt,
30
days
later,
to
put
the
stuyvesant
in
again.
so
that,
the
stuyvesant
itself
was
waiting
in
the
wings
to
be
entered
again
into
domestic
trade
when
the
petition
--
when
the
respondents
had
been
denied
a
permanent
injunction.
i
would
like
also
to
advert
to
the
point
that
mr.
levander
made
suggesting
that
following
a
remand
proceeding
before
the
department
of
commerce,
it
would
have
been
possible
to
question
the
standing
of
the
--
what
li
--
then
of
the
plaintiffs'
to
bring
the
action.
and,
i
would
say,
one,
it's
a
strange
procedure
indeed
that
if
you
are
remanded
for
a
determination
of
competitive
impact
and
there's
a
finding
of
no
competitive
impact,
you
thereby
lose
your
standing
to
attack
or
to
review
the
finding
of
no
competitive
impact.
and,
quite
apart
from
that,
it
is
certainly
true
that
a
two-year-charter
of
the
shell
ship
is
which
what
--
which
is
what
happened,
does
not
take
care
of
20
years
of
injury
when
the
stuyvesant
is
permanently
waived.
now,
the
question
came
up,
mr.
chief
justice
burger
raised
the
question
about
the
similarity
between
this
case
and
the
chase
manhattan
bank
financing.
and
then,
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
point
that
you
might
be
able
to
pay
back
the
chase
manhattan
bank
and
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
that
you
might
need
a
prepayment
requirement,
but
that
the
secretary
might
not
be
able
to
be
forced
to
take
back
cds.
instead,
the
secretary
would
have
to
make
some
findings
before
she
could
take
back
cds.
now,
the
only
place
where
there
are
any
findings
suggested
at
all
that
the
secretary
might
have
to
make
is
in
the
opinion
of
judge
richie.
the
statute
doesn't
set
forth
any
findings
for
the
secretary
to
make.
the
reason
why
the
statute
doesn't
set
forth
any
findings
for
the
secretary
to
make
is
because
there
never
was
a
thought
that
there
would
be
a
permanent
payback
of
cds.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
there
are
findings
to
be
made
for
a
temporary.
the
finding
is
that
it
is
necessary
or
appropriate
to
the
purposes
of
the
act,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
chairman
kennedy
raised
the
question
in
1938
with
regard
to
the
ambiguity
because
there
was
absolutely
no
standard
suggested
other
than
the
three-month
standard.
now,
the
--
finally,
i
would
like
to
make
this
--
the
point
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
a
one-time
statute
with
a
one-time
contract
with
restrictions
would
be
amendable
by
the
contracting
party
to
which
mrs.
klein
answered
“no,
it
would
not
be,”
and
i
certainly
want
to
endorse
everything
that
mrs.
klein
says
before
this
court.
but
i
would
add
one
additional
point,
that
the
words
of
title
506
--
section
506
are
not
the
purchaser.
the
words
are
“every
owner.”
the
words
are
“every
owner
shall
agree,”
and
the
whole
purpose
of
those
words
is
that
they
jus
--
they
go
on
as
title
goes
on
and,
in
fact,
the
maritime
administration
refers
to
this
as
a
covenant
running
with
the
ship.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
what?
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
well,
that's
very
--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that's
a
very
interesting
point,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
current
owner
did
not
agree
in
the
face
of
the
language
which
said
“every
owner
must
agree”
because
the
secretary
removed
it
before
that
owner
had
to
agree
with
it.
this
whole
case
is
presented
--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that
would
be
an
adequate
way
of
expressing
it
mr.
justice,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
complete
way
of
sug
--
of
expressing
it
because
the
whole
issue
with
regard
to
cds
is
foreign
commerce.
cds
has
no
meaning
except
for
foreign
commerce.
it
is
not
cdl,
construction
deferential
loan.
it's
talking
about
paying
it
back.
it's
the
worst
case
of
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
it
is
a
subsidy.
the
secretary
of
commerce
really
doesn't
want
the
subsidy
back.
what
she
wants
is
ships
in
foreign
commerce.
there
--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that's
exactly
correct.
that's
precisely
the
balance
that
is
drawn.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that's
precisely
correct
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
you
have
a
ship
built
for
foreign
commerce
and
there
may
be
some
incidental
needs
for
it
to
participate
in
domestic
commerce.
one
of
those
are
the
enumerated
trades
that
are
set
forth
in
title
506
and
the
other
is
a
temporary
transfer
up
to
six
months
when
the
secretary
has
made
the
necessary
findings.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
but
you
can
only
string
the
exemptions
after
a
six-month
hiatus.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
right.
that
any
time
--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that
that
--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
the
--
on
the
assumption
that
it
did,
in
fact
--
was
necessary
and
appropriate
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act,
and
--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
yes.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
i
would
expect
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it's
also
true
that
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
competing
with
a
ship
that
is
available
in
six-month
units
out
of
each
year
and
competing
with
a
ship
that
is
available
for
the
full
year.
they
ser
--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
exactly
explains
why
you
deal
in
temporary
transfers
in
this
connection
because
six
months
is
the
kind
of
discrete
unit
as
to
which
a
rational
judgment
can
be
made.
one
of
the
things
that
came
out
of
the
remand
proceedings
was
the
statement
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
that
you
could
not
make
a
projection
more
than
three
years
into
the
future.
now,
that
is
some
sort
of
basis
on
which
to
allow
a
ship
to
engage
permanently
in
foreign
trade.
it
also
speaks
to
why
there
really
are
no
standards
in
the
act
because
congress
never
intended
that
there
would
be
a
transfer
longer
than
a
six-month
period.
there
is
only
one
provision
in
section
509
which
deals
with
the
question
of
loans
as
this
is
--
attempts
to
be
described
here
or
which
deals
with
the
question
of
building
for
the
domestic
trade
and
that's
section
509
which
allows
the
secretary
to
make
provision
for
building
a
ship
and
then
sell
it
to
the
purchaser
for
12.5%
down
or
25%
down,
depending
upon
what
type
of
ship
it
is
and
section
509
specifically
says
“no
construction
deferential
subsidy
shall
be
allowed.”
with
regard
to
construction
deferential
subsidy,
title
v
is
perfectly
clear
that
foreign
commerce
is
the
sole
purpose
of
it.
section
501
establishes
construction
deferential
subsidy
in
these
words
“to
aid
in
the
construction
of
a
new
vessel
to
be
used
in
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states."
the
secretary
of
commerce
must
determine
before
approving
an
application
to
“the
plans
and
specifications
call
for
a
new
vessel
which
will
meet
the
requirements
of
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states.”
she
has
to
determine
“that
the
plans
will
aid
in
the
promotion
and
development
of
such
commerce”
and
section
506,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
is
a
continuing
prescription.
it
does
not
apply
to
the
purchaser
or
the
shipyard.
it
applies
to
every
owner.
it
says
“every
owner
shall
agree,”
not
may
agree.
it
applies
to
every
vessel
for
which
cds
has
been
paid,
not
“has
been
paid
and
has
not
been
repaid.”
it
allows
only
the
two
indicated
domestic
uses,
one
incidental
and
two
for
six-month
periods
and
it
is
the
result
of
an
amendment
in
1938
at
which
time,
chairman
kennedy
did
submit
a
draft.
chairman
kennedy's
draft
was
enacted
and
the
words
that
chairman
kennedy
said
to
describe
this
were,
“if
the
owner
desires
to
engage
in
domestic
trades
other
than
those
enumerated
in
this
section
he
can
do
so
only
by
receiving
the
consent
of
the
commission.”
the
consent
for
this
service
is
limited
to
six
months
in
any
one
year.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
the
qualification
that
--
to
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
that
was
both
the
only
ambiguity
in
the
act
and
the
ambiguity
that
he
said
was
being
corrected.
so,
i
think
it
was
both
what
he
was
criticizing
and
what
he
wanted
in
the
sense
that
he
was
observing
the
one
ambiguity
and
he
was
suggesting
the
correction.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
i
don't
find
the
section,
since
1938,
to
contain
any
ambiguity.
the
only
way
that
the
section
can
contain
an
ambiguity
is
a
way
that
is
classically
brought
out
by
footnote
2
of
the
government's
reply
brief
which
says
that
“a
ship
that
has
repaid
the
subsidy
in
full
and,
therefore,
no
longer
enjoys
the
benefits
of
that
subsidy”
is
simply
not
a
vessel
for
which
subsidy
has
been
paid.
if
it
sells
like
a
ship
which
has
been
paid
subsidy
in
order
to
repay
subsidy,
it
is
not
a
ship
as
to
which
subsidy
has
been
paid,
i
don't
know
what
ship
it
might
be.
there
is
no
warrant
in
the
statute.
the
statute
is
clear.
there
is
no
need
to
go
to
the
legislative
history
and
if
the
legislative
history
is
going
to
consider
it,
it
is
clear
that
the
statute
advertently
does
what
it
does
which
is
to
confine
any
sort
of
domestic
trade
by
cds
–
sh
--
built
ships
to
two
types,
incidental
in
the
enumerated
services
and
six-month
temporary
transfers.
thank
you
very
much.
