you
are
dealing
with
a
lot
of
imponderables.
for
example,
you
would
rather
have
one
strong-willed
juror
on
your
side
than
eight
weak-minded
ones
on
the
other
side,
wouldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
trouble
with
the
figures.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
i
understand
your
problem,
but
isn't
that
what
your
problem
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
pretty
close
in
the
fifth
circuit
these
days
to
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
would
back
up
for
just
a
minute,
about
the
other
people
now
in
jail
who
might
be
affected.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
practically
none
of
them
can
show
that
there
was
a
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there
wouldn't
be
many
who
could
show.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
the
contrary,
wouldn't
it
be
a
burden
on
the
person
alleging
to
show
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
they
couldn't
show
it,
they
wouldn't
get
a
hearing,
would
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
could
find
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
might
have
to
dig
some
of
them
up.
