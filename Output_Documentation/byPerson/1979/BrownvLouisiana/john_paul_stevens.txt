justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
--
ballew
was
the
five-man,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
you
have
argued
that
was
retroactive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
people
who
before
ballew
had
been
convicted
by
five,
would
they
be
out
under
ballew?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you
arguing
for
retroactivity
back
behind
ballew?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
back
to
ballew?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that
that
would
not
--
ballew
was
'70?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
must
be
arguing
for
retroactivity
of
ballew
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lawrence,
do
you
know
what
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
have
been
imposed
for
conviction
by
a
five-man
jury?
wasn't
it
generally
for
rather
minor
offenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
any
of
them
provide
for
a
sentence
of
in
excess
of
six
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
nine-year
maximum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
is
it
likely
that
there
are
quite
a
few
people
in
jail?
your
answer
was
if
they
were
subject
to
a
multiple
bill.
i
think
what
he
is
asking
is
were
there
very
many
subjected
to
multiple
bills,
as
you
call
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
this
case
as
i
understand
it
involves
a
conviction
which
had
not
yet
become
final
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
in
your
defender
practice
routinely
ask
for
a
poll?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
most
defense
lawyers
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
there
is
an
acquittal,
is
there
a
poll?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
gather
from
your
point
--
maybe
i
didn't
get
it
right
--
that
that
is
probably
where
the
problem
is
most
likely
to
occur,
is
that
right?
there
are
more
trials
using
this
particular
procedure,
or
is
that
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
argue
that
even
if
ballew
were
retroactive,
burch
is
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wouldn't
you
think
that
if
burch
would
have
to
be
retroactive
a
fortiori,
that
ballew
would
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
say,
that
is
very
revealing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
nothing
on
federal
habeas,
do
you
suppose
you
could
poll
the
jury
if
they
were
still
alive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
know
of
any
louisiana
law
that
would
prevent
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
not
impeaching
it,
it,
is
just
a
question
of
fact.
