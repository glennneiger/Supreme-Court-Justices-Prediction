justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
had
already
upheld
the
six
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
only
reason
there
was
a
line
drawn,
is
because
the
six-person
jury
had
been
upheld.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
say
we
are
only
talking
about
going
back
to
'78?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
five-out-of-six
thing
could
only
have
been
happening
since
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
retroactivity
of
ballew
been
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
one
would
certainly
decided
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
really
not
talking
about
just
back
to
'74.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
at
least
talking
about
it
in
louisiana
and
oklahoma.
you
are
talking
about
anybody
who
is
still
in
jail
who
has
been
convicted
by
either
a
five-man
jury
or
by
a
five-out-of-six
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
the
sentences
in
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
not
unusual?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
maximum
you
could
be
sentenced
to
by
a
five-man
jury
prior
to
'74
in
case
of
a
repeater?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
may
be
quite
a
few
people
in
jail
still
who
here
convicted
prior
to
'74
by
a
five-man
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
go
back
to
the
question
asked
by
the
chief
justice.
i
think
the
question
was
which
do
you
regard
as
possessing
the
greater
integrity,
a
jury
verdict
unanimous
with
five
or
divided
with
six,
and
you
said
you
couldn't
detect
any
difference.
do
you
still
feel
that
way,
even
though
there
is,
as
the
chief
suggested
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
respond
that
way
because
you
see
some
advantage
in
having
a
challenger
in
the
jury
room
who
is
in
effect
going
to
make
the
other
five
jurors
think
a
little
longer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
say
you
have
it
close
to
that
in
the
fifth
circuit
these
days
when
you
sit
en
banc,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
the
time
burch
was
decided.
do
you
happen
to
know
if
there
are
proceedings
attacking
collaterally
final
convictions
on
the
basis
of
burch
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
anyway,
it
can
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
can
happen
than
that
he
could
have
a
sentence
for
life
and
be
convicted
by
five
out
of
six?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
tell
when
a
verdict
has
been
unanimous
on
the
six-man
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
poll
wasn't
taken?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
required,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
do
you
ever
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
once
the
trial
is
over
how
would
you
ever
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
wouldn't
make
much
difference,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
weren't
far
apart.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
far
apart
were
they
in
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
terms
of
impact
on
justice,
even
if
burch
were
retroactive
back
to
ballew,
it
wouldn't
make
that
much
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
numbers
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
we
are
talking
about
then
is
300
cases
minus
an
unknown
number
of
unanimous
cases
and
again
minus
an
unknown
number
of
cases
which
the
record
is
unclear.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
ballew?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
chester,
in
the
ballew-type
case
the
proof
would
be
very
simple,
we
would
know
--
i
guess
everybody
who
was
convicted
there
has
a
claim,
whereas
in
the
burch-type
case
a
large
percentage
may
not
have
a
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
may
argue
for
making
it
the
other
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
you
defending
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
your
advice?
or
was
it
always
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
got
the
summary
records,
haven't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
a
lot
of
them
may
be
dead
by
now
or
moved
away
or
something,
i
agree
with
you.
but
if
they
were
around,
if
you
even
found
one
of
them
you
could
probably
find
out
if
it
was
unanimous.
