justice
potter
stewart
you
say
you
are
aware
that
is
going
on?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
didn't
understand
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
really
need
an
embellishment
to
your
answer.
i
didn't
hear
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
aware
that
that
is
going
on.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
you
wouldn't,
but
is
there
one?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
don't
you
at
least
think
that
ballew
heralded
burch?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
be
able
to
estimate
how
many
of
those
were
non-unanimous?
justice
potter
stewart
that
ballew
did
say
that
there
is
a
real
danger
of
reliability?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
think
that
is
not
the
basis
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
that
is
not
the
basis
for
burch?
justice
potter
stewart
ballew
said
that
only
five
persons
really
raised
a
substantial
doubt
about
not
only
the
composition
and
representational
nature
of
the
jury
but
about
the
reliability
of
its
verdict.
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
think
burch
said
the
same
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
feel
that
the
illegality
in
burch
of
a
five-out-of-six
verdict
rested
on
the
danger
of
unreliability?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
it
was?
justice
potter
stewart
destefano
v.
woods
and
duncan
v.
louisiana
are
not
retroactive?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
gosa
v.
mayden,
what
did
that
hold?
justice
potter
stewart
before
this
system
you
had,
what,
six-member
juries
unanimous
or
five-member
juries?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
precisely
what
was
held
invalid
in
ballew?
justice
potter
stewart
ballew
v.
georgia.
justice
potter
stewart
and
louisiana
had
the
unanimous
five-member
jury
for
a
long
time,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
in
the
1921
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
just
took
80
percent
--
you
really
get
the
guilty
pleas
in
80
to
85
percent
of
the
cases,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
after
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
only
for
sentencing
then?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
there
is
to
be
multiple
billing
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutor?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
matter
of
prosecutorial
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
then
that
can
be
denied
and
that
is
tried
before
the
sentencing
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
chronology
here,
mr.
chester?
at
the
time
he
was
tried,
burch
had
not
been
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
it
hadn't
been
decided
at
the
time
he
committed
the
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
which
had
not
been
decided
in
the
meantime.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
chester,
i
notice
at
the
time
that
you
wrote
your
brief
you
didn't
have
the
citation
to
the
u.s.
reports
in
burch
v.
louisiana.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
it
now?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
weren't
so
strong
you
would
go
for
that
will
card?
