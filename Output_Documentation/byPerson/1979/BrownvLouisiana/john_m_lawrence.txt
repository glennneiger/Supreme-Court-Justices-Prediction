mr.
john
m.
lawrence
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
to
apply
the
court's
ruling
in
burch
v.
louisiana
that
a
verdict
of
five
out
of
six
on
a
bobtail
jury
should
be
applied
retroactively
to
this
case,
and
if
so
if
any
other
cases
are
involved,
whether
there
should
be
full
retroactivity
or
limited
retroactivity
to
cases
pending
but
not
yet
filed
at
the
time
that
burch
was
decided.
darnell
brown
was
convicted
in
orleans
parish
of
simple
burglary
by
five-to-one
vote.
he
was
then
multiple-billed
and
sentenced
to
serve
22
years.
we
are
relying
on
the
rule
in
hankerson
v.
north
carolina
as
the
rule
to
apply
in
this
case.
similarly,
we
are
relying
on
the
rule
in
witherspoon
and
ballew
v.
georgia,
as
well
as
burch
v.
louisiana.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
in
stovall
v.
denno
the
guidelines
came
out,
the
criterion
to
apply.
in
ballew
v.
georgia,
the
statistics
came
out,
and
in
burch
the
five-out-of-six
decision
was
made.
but
in
stovall
and
later
with
linkletter,
the
court
drew
on
three
factors
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
rule,
the
reliance
on
good
faith
by
the
state
authorities
on
the
old
rule,
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
by
implementing
the
new
rule.
in
hankerson,
the
court
looked
to
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule
and
that
if
that
purpose
was
to
enhance
the
truth
of
the
fact-finding
matter,
then
you
need
not
look
to
reliance
and
effect,
and
that
if
the
purpose
was
only
to
incidentally
enhance
the
truth
finding
function
or
if
it
was
small,
then
you
would
consider
the
other
factors.
we
submit
here
that
we
are
in
a
better
position
than
the
litigant
in
hankerson
because
we
are
not
concerned
with
just
an
incidental
enhancement
of
the
truth
finding
function.
if
you
will
recall
in
ballew
when
the
statistics
were
mentioned,
they
talk
about
prevention
of
type
one
error
which
is
that
an
innocent
man
should
not
be
wrongfully
convicted
being
weighed
ten
times
more
heavily
than
the
prevention
of
the
type
two
error
that
a
guilty
person
should
go
free.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that
was
in
ballew.
that
came
out
of
ballew
from
the
statistics
that
the
court
considered
in
making
its
decision.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
no,
it
is
not
this
court's
statement.
that
is
the
statistics.
the
fact
remains
that
the
enhancement
here
is
not
incidental
or
small,
that
the
unanimity
requirement,
where
do
you
draw
the
line,
the
unanimity
requirement
in
a
bobtail
jury
is
where
you
draw
the
line,
whether
it
is
six
of
six
or
five
out
of
six,
as
in
the
case
of
brown.
now,
when
you
look
at
the
reliance
by
state
authorities,
after
ballew
and
williams
v.
florida,
they
were
put
on
notice
that
unanimity
was
being
favored
and
not
five
out
of
six
any
more.
that
is
the
reason
that
the
motion
to
quash
the
five-out-of-six
panel
requirement
was
filed.
the
purpose
also
in
burch
was
to
assure
accuracy
in
jury
verdicts,
to
overcome
an
aspect
of
the
criminal
trial
that
substantially
impaired
the
truth
finding
function,
and
raised
serious
doubts
about
prior
trials,
where
five
out
of
six
would
convict
someone.
that
is
the
reason
for
ballew
and
burch.
so
here
we
are
on
similar
ground
with
hankerson,
that
the
purpose
of
burch
is
to
enhance
the
fact-finding
process,
but
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
other
factors,
such
as
the
reliance
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice,
you
should
consider
this,
that
we
are
talking
about
really
two
states
here,
louisiana
and
oklahoma,
who
have
the
five
out
of
six
requirements.
most
of
the
people
who
were
convicted
five
of
six
have
already
served
their
sentences
and
are
out
of
prison.
some
people
who
have
been
multiple-billed
are
not,
but
most
of
the
people
who
were
convicted
are
already
out.
we
are
talking
about
a
period
of
time
between
1974
and
1978
and
we
are
not
talking
about
people
charged
with
relative
felonies
who
pled
guilty
or
who
were
convicted
six
to
nothing.
we
are
talking
only
about
five-one,
so
there
is
a
relatively
small
number
of
people
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes.
ballew
said
that
a
verdict
by
five
was
illegal.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that
ballew
was
retroactive?
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that
was
a
unanimous
group.
the
inner
working
of
the
jury
was
a
unanimous
group
then.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
and
prior
to
1974,
when
we
tried
these
cases,
where
we
have
the
five-man
jury,
it
was
a
unanimous
requirement.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
no.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that's
right.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
ballew
was
in
'78.
burch
was
in
'78.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
well,
ballew
only
had
five
people
on
the
jury.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
and
in
this
decision
we
are
talking
about
five
people
convicting
out
of
six.
and
burch
came
after
ballew.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
so
i
would
argue
that
any
retroactivity
--
yes,
i'm
sorry,
also
includes
cases
in
ballew,
yes,
back
to
1974.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
there
are
not.
there
is
no
louisiana
agency
that
has
these
figures,
and
what
i
am
trying
to
show
the
court
here
is
that
we
are
talking
about
a
small
number
of
people.
these
are
relative
felonies,
small
crimes,
where
the
legislative
has
not
seen
fit
to
give
more
significance
to
the
number
of
people
needed
to
convict.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
we
are
not
talking
here
about
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
or
a
judge
trial.
we
are
talking
here
about
the
inner
workings
of
a
jury.
after
you
have
made
that
decision
to
go
before
a
group
of
people
between
the
defendant
and
the
prosecutor.
we
are
talking
about
that
and
not
the
right
to
a
jury
or
a
judge.
once
we
get
into
the
inner
working
of
the
jury,
the
five
of
six
or
the
six
of
six,
the
unanimity
requirement,
it
is
a
different
matter.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
i
would
have
to
draw
on
my
own
prior
experience
before
1974
and
i
will
be
very
candid
with
the
court
in
telling
the
court
that
at
that
time
i
favored
five
out
of
five,
unanimity,
but
i
am
not
going
to
argue
with
the
requirement
now
of
the
six,
but
i
never
favored
the
five
out
of
six.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
unanimity,
six
out
of
six.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
i
see
no
difference.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
i
see
no
difference
in
the
--
except
that
you
may
be
dealing
with
one
person
if
you
have
a
five-out-of-six
situation
that
you
would
not
be
dealing
with
if
you
had
a
five-out-of-five.
but
i
certainly
don't
want
to
argue
with
the
requirement
now
of
six-out-of-six,
unanimity.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
if
you
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
if
there
is
an
advantage
to
it,
then
i
would
recall
that
in
ballew
they
talk
about
the
five
factors
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
small
jury,
the
lack
of
discussion
that
goes
on,
that
the
minority
view-point
may
not
be
adhered
to,
and
that
the
position
of
the
defense
is
of
some
detriment
when
you
have
a
small
jury.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
one
line,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
unanimity.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
correct.
now,
in
our
situation,
our
case
was
pending
on
review
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court
at
the
time
burch
was
decided
and
we
raised
the
issue
by
motion
to
quash
after
ballew
came
out.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
prior
to
1974,
in
our
state,
the
statute
provided
for
a
five-man
jury.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
since
1974
through
1978.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
no.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes,
sir,
it
should.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
as
i
understand
it,
if
there
are
other
states
who
have
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
if
they
are
still
in
jail.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes,
it
was
for
minor
offenses,
what
they
call
relative
felonies
where
you
could
get
not
necessarily
hard
labor
but
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
at
that
time
it
provided
for
a
nine-years
sentence.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
nine-years
maximum.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
in
this
case
there
was
a
multiple
bill
filed
and
he
got
22
years.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
not
with
people
convicted
in
orleans
parish
with
a
prior
criminal
record,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
18
years
on
a
double
bill
and
18
years
on
a
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
if
they
were
multiple
bill.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
and
if
they
were
in
orleans
parish.
but
if
they
were
outside
of
orleans
parish,
in
the
other
parishes,
probably
not.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
let
me
explain
it
this
way.
in
1974,
there
was
a
new
policy
for
multiple
billing
that
came
into
effect
and
after
that
there
was
a
denial
of
good
time
that
case
into
effect,
and
i
believe
in
1977
--
now,
the
people
sentenced
before
that
got
the
benefit
of
good
time
and
probably
are
not
in
jail,
people
from,
say,
'77
on
are
likely
to
be
in
jail
under
multiple
bill.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
if
they
were
multiple
billed
in
1976
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
--
say
'76
or
back
to
1974,
during
that
period
of
time,
their
good
time
would
not
be
affected
by
the
multiple
billing
and
whatever
their
sentence
would
be
from
zero
--
from
a
third
of
the
maximum,
which
would
be
three
years,
which
most
of
them
received,
three
to
the
maximum
of
18
on
a
multiple
bill
at
that
time,
they
would
be
out
of
jail.
if
they
received
the
heavy
end
of
the
sentence
on
a
multiple
bill,
they
may
still
be
there,
but
again
this
applies
to
orleans
parish
and
not
to
most
of
the
other
parishes
in
the
state.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
over
a
million.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
over
a
million.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that
is
by
practice.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
you
have
the
wild
card
but
i
would
like
to
just
draw
my
own
experience
when
i
tried
cases
at
that
time.
i
feel
that
a
unanimous
verdict
is
always
preferable
but
if
you
limit
me
to
five
of
five
or
five
out
of
six
--
and
i
would
for
the
sake
of
this
argument
say
i
would
prefer
to
have
five
out
of
six,
but
since
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
new
rule
in
burch
that
has
thrown
this
out
and
require
six
of
six,
then
i
would
of
course
feel
that
six
is
much
better
because
it
is
unanimous
and
does
not
have
a
wild
card.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
it
depends.
it
is
a
two-edge
sword,
chief
justice
burger.
it
could
also
affect
a
not
guilty
verdict.
but
as
far
as
the
guilty
verdicts,
sometimes
--
and
i
really
have
to
draw
on
my
own
experience
again
--
sometimes
it
did
work
to
our
advantage.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
there
is
no
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
i
would
like
to
see
all
of
these
cases
tried
by
twelve-member
juries,
but
since
we
are
talking
about
the
small
juries
then
we
are
limited
to
that
factor.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
from
my
viewpoint,
yes,
it
would.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
if
i
had
enough
guts
to
try
it
that
way,
i
would
do
it.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that's
true.
i
have
only
to
say
that
i
would
ask
the
court,
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
to
reverse
the
holding
of
the
state
supreme
court
and
to
apply
retroactively
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
i'm
aware
that
they
are
doing
that,
yes.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
well,
i
have
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
again,
i
am
drawing
on
my
experience
with
correspondence
with
people
who
have
been
convicted
and
are
in
the
parish
prison
at
this
time,
yes.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
i'm
sorry.
i
would
say
that
those
are
under
way,
yes.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that
is
if
he
has
four
felony
convictions.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
from
20
to
life.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes,
that's
correct.
that
to
my
knowledge
has
not
happened.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
at
the
end
of
the
trial
you
ask
for
a
poll
of
the
verdict.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
they
take
it
in
open
court
right
at
the
end
of
the
trial.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
it
is
not
required.
it
sometimes
does
not
go
into
the
court
records.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
we
don't.
we
ask
the
jury.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
if
there
is
no
poll
taken,
you
would
not
know.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
it
may
be
recorded
by
the
stenographer
but
it
is
not
usually
made
part
of
the
record.
it
can
be,
but
usually
the
poll
is
taken,
the
number
is
given
and
that
is
it,
there
is
no
further
action
on
it.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes,
unless
i
have
the
advantage
and
then
i
don't.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes,
as
a
matter
of
practice
they
do,
in
any
of
the
verdicts
they
do,
whether
it
is
five
out
of
six
or
twelve
out
of
twelve.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
i
would
never
ask
for
one.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
sometimes
the
state
does,
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
to
the
court,
and
it
is
not
really
in
the
nature
of
rebuttal
but
it
is
just
something
i
feel
the
court
should
know.
in
1974,
for
cases
that
were
tried
after
1974
or
in
the
year
1974
which
were
committed
in
'73,
the
defendant
had
his
choice
to
be
tried
with
five
of
five
or
five
of
six.
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
a
defendant
did
have
a
choice.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
it
would
depend
on
the
type
of
case
i
had.
if
i
had
a
good
case
i
might
go
with
five-man
jury.
if
i
had
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
right.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
if
we
had
that
it
would
be
even
better
for
us.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
there
are
some
attorneys
who
did
poll
and
in
some
cases
there
are
records
to
show
the
number,
but
not
all.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
it
would
be
a
matter
of
chance,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that's
correct,
too.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that's
right.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
in
that
case
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
it
could
be
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
without
polling
the
jury
if
this
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
from
polling
the
jury
if
they
were
able
to
be
found?
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
they
would
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
if
you
could
find
them
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
yes,
if
they
are
still
there.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
i'm
sure
they
would
remember
the
count.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
there
is
a
statute
that
says
that
the
jury
is
not
competent
to
impeach
its
own
verdict
and
i
have
only
seen
--
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that's
correct,
too.
i
have
had
two
of
those
cases
though
in
the
last
ten
years.
mr.
john
m.
lawrence
that's
correct.
