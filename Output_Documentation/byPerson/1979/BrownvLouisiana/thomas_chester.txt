mr.
thomas
chester
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
state
of
louisiana
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
burch
v.
louisiana
should
be
applied
prospectively
only,
for
three
reasons.
first
is
that
petitioner
darnell
brown
has
failed
to
establish
that
serious
and
substantial
doubts
exist
as
to
the
accuracy
of
non-unanimous
verdicts
before
the
time
of
burch.
second,
the
state
of
louisiana
conducted
numerous
jury
trials
before
this
court
ruled
in
burch
in
good-faith
reliance
on
what
the
law
was
earlier.
and
third,
the
contrary
ruling
would
have
a
seriously
disruptive
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
in
louisiana.
mr.
thomas
chester
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
the
state's
position
is
this
first
of
all,
in
burch
there
was
--
mr.
thomas
chester
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
the
relevant
test
could
be
applied
to
these
two
cases
and
differing
results
could
--
mr.
thomas
chester
i
believe
there
are
differences.
mr.
thomas
chester
about
a
year.
i
believe
ballew
was
decided
in
'78
and
burch
was
decided
in
'79.
mr.
thomas
chester
if
burch
were
retroactive
back
to
ballew?
mr.
thomas
chester
i
believe
there
would
be
a
substantial
number
of
jury
trials
having
been
tried
in
the
interim
period,
approximately
one
year.
the
court
asked
mr.
lawrence
how
many
persons
would
be
affected.
the
orleans
parish
district
attorney's
office
in
the
four
years
that
non-unanimous
jury
verdicts
were
law,
we
tried
approximately
300
cases.
this
is
just
for
the
city
of
new
orleans,
not
counting
the
other
parishes.
mr.
thomas
chester
in
no
way,
your
honor.
i
imagine
you
could
go
back
to
each
particular
record
and
look
and
see
if
a
poll
had
been
requested.
if
a
poll
had
been
requested,
whether
the
verdict
or
the
count
had
been
recorded.
as
the
state
pointed
out
in
its
brief,
it
has
been
the
practice
of
some
judges
to
merely
examine
the
ballots
that
the
individual
jurors
fill
out
and
then
announce
for
the
record
whether
or
not
the
verdict
is
lawful.
mr.
thomas
chester
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
not
necessarily.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir,
for
orleans
parish
alone,
not
for
the
entire
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
thomas
chester
i
believe
the
procedure
would
have
been
the
same
all
through
the
state.
mr.
thomas
chester
the
parish
of
orleans
does
have
a
disproportionate
amount
of
jury
trials
because
it
has
much
more
serious
crime
problems
than
some
of
the
other
parishes
do.
mr.
thomas
chester
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
but
i
know
that
the
population
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
is
about
one-half
million.
mr.
thomas
chester
i
think
what
your
honor
is
getting
at
is
about
what
proportion
of
jury
trials
in
the
state
were
held
in
new
orleans.
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
roughly
a
third
to
a
quarter.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
from
talking
with
people
in
the
department
of
corrections,
i
understand
that
about
a
third
to
a
quarter
of
their
inmates
come
from
new
orleans.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
chester
i
don't
know
if
that
that
would
be
a
correct
statement
of
the
situation,
your
honor.
however,
i
believe
there
would
be
a
substantial
number
who
could
not
show.
mr.
thomas
chester
there
would
be
some
but
not
all.
mr.
thomas
chester
how
--
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir,
some
defense
attorneys
always
poll
the
jury,
others
do
not.
it
is
not
required
by
law.
mr.
thomas
chester
no,
that
is
incorrect.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
as
i
was
saying,
petitioner
brown
was
convicted
by
one
of
these
non-unanimous
juries
in
1978,
august,
about
nine
months
before
this
court
decided
burch.
as
a
habitual
felon,
he
received
a
sentence
of
22
years
which
i
submit
to
the
court
is
not
a
minor
sentence.
mr.
brown
had
been
convicted
about
six
or
seven
times
previously.
after
he
was
convicted
he
appealed
the
sentence
and
his
conviction.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
may
of
1979.
the
particular
record
in
this
case
certainly
fails
to
reflect
any
miscarriage
of
justice
as
to
petitioner,
darnell
brown.
the
record
reflects
that
brown
was
arrested
inside
of
a
ransacked
residence,
that
he
tried
to
flee
--
mr.
thomas
chester
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
nine
unanimous
jury
verdicts
are
inaccurate,
are
unjust,
if
there
is
a
good
chance
that
they
are
erroneous.
in
this
case
there
is
not.
the
gist
of
what
petitioner
argues
therefore
is
that
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases
there
must
be
error
to
justify
wholesale
and
a
windfall
reversal
of
prior
convictions,
a
substantial
number
of
prior
convictions.
the
state
concedes
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
sixth
amendment
that
was
the
subject
of
burch
v.
louisiana
pertains
to
what
has
been
called
the
fact-finding
process
by
this
court,
but
we
submit
also
that
it
is
well
settled
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
fact-finding
process
is
involved
in
a
particular
ruling
does
not
mandate
automatic
retroactivity.
since
it
would
be
improper
and
impossible
to
review
all
of
the
convictions
and
the
records
of
all
the
convictions,
we
have
to
look
at
this
issue
in
general
terms
from
what
the
jurisprudence
has
taught
us
about
the
jury
trial
and
in
functions.
the
purpose
of
the
jury
trial
is
to
prevent
government
oppression.
the
main
feature
of
the
jury
trial
is
an
interposition
between
the
accused
and
the
accuser,
of
what
this
court
has
called
the
common
sense
deliberations
of
a
group
of
laymen.
the
court
has
further
ruled
that
this
interposition
can
operate
if
the
jury
can
deliberate
effectively
and
if
it
fairly
represents
a
cross-section
of
the
community
from
which
it
has
been
taken.
many
of
these
features
are
functions
of
the
absolute
size
of
the
jury
rather
than
the
composition
of
the
final
ballot.
for
example,
it
has
been
established
that
by
empaneling
six
jurors,
the
cross-section
requirement
is
satisfied.
and
i
believe
the
court
has
rejected
the
argument
that
the
fact
that
a
member
of
the
minority
group
is
ultimately
out-voted
does
not
indicate
that
his
position
was
not
or
the
position
of
the
minority
was
not
adequately
represented
during
the
jury
deliberations.
the
court
in
ballew
expressed
some
concern
about
the
collective
memory
of
the
jury,
and
i
think
it
has
been
further
established
that
when
six
persons
are
empaneled
they
are
able
when
they
go
back
to
that
deliberation
room
to
remember
all
the
facts
and
arguments
that
were
important
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
also
the
state
would
suggest
that
it
can't
be
said
that
a
lay
body
has
failed
to
interpose
itself
between
accused
and
accuser,
whether
the
final
verdict
is
unanimous
or
non-unanimous.
reading
burch
together
with
this
court's
prior
decisions
suggests
that,
while
unanimous
jury
verdicts
may
indicate
that
more
perfect
deliberation
processes
occur,
that
the
extent
to
which
non-unanimous
jury
verdicts
infect
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
ranks
low
on
the
scale
of
probabilities.
the
language
of
the
burch
decision
supports
this.
the
majority
opinion
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
at
several
points
noted
that
the
case
was
a
close
one,
but
went
on
to
state
that
it
was
necessary
to
draw
lines,
that
demarcation
lines
had
to
be
drawn
at
some
point
if
the
substance
of
the
trial
was
to
be
preserved.
the
state
of
louisiana
would
liken
the
rule
of
burch
to
the
rule
of
callahan
v.
parker
as
interpreted
in
gosa
v.
mayden,
and
that
is
that
it
is
a
prophylactic
rule
that
only
incidentally
enhances
the
reliability
of
the
fact-finding
process.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
there
are
several
--
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
chester
as
i
stated,
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
chester
i
think
that
the
major
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
that
the
prior
jurisprudence,
up
until
the
time
of
burch,
talks
more
in
terms
of
the
absolute
size
of
the
jury,
representation
of
the
community.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
some
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
chester
no,
sir,
i
don't.
i
believe
burch
was
more
of
a
line-drawing
decision.
i
think
that
some
of
the
features
of
the
jury
trial
are
more
perfectly
represented
in
a
non-unanimous
six-member
jury
than
there
are
in
a
five-member
jury.
those
are
particularly
cross-section
of
the
community,
the
jury's
ability
to
remember,
and
certain
other
facts.
mr.
thomas
chester
i
believe
that
that
was
a
factor
in
the
case,
but
i
believe
--
mr.
thomas
chester
i
believe
it
was
a
factor
in
the
case,
but
i
don't
believe
that
was
the
reason
for
the
whole
decision.
i
believe
there
was
a
line-drawing
decision
and
i
think
that
that
was
noted
in
the
opinion
several
times.
the
state
would
further
submit
that
the
court's
ruling
in
destefano
v.
woods
and
gosa
v.
mayden
are
dispositive
of
the
issue
before
the
court.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
court
denied
retroactive
application
to
cases
where
jury
trials
had
been
denied
outright,
where
the
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment
as
it
relates
to
trial
had
been
frustrated
entirely.
mr.
thomas
chester
not
retroactive,
no.
mr.
thomas
chester
that
was
a
case
which
interpreted
o'callahan
as
not
being
retroactive,
o'callahan
being
the
decision
as
to
the
military
civil
trial.
mr.
thomas
chester
the
state's
position
is
that
if
these
cases
are
not
retroactive,
then
burch
v.
louisiana
should
not
be
retroactive
because
--
mr.
thomas
chester
although
i
have
prepared
an
argument
as
to
ballew,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
you
applied
the
same
test,
the
stovall
three-pronged
balancing
test,
i
think
you
would
find
also
that
ballew
should
not
be
retroactive.
if
you
are
talking
in
terms
of
reliance
on
prior
jurisprudence,
prior
law,
if
you
are
talking
about
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
--
i
think
when
these
factors
are
balanced
against
the
purpose
of
both
of
the
decisions,
the
ultimate
ruling
should
be
that
they
are
prospective
only.
however,
i
think
that
the
case
is
stronger
in
burch
for
prospective
application
than
it
is
in
ballew.
i
believe
that
burch
was
not
as
grounded
in
fairness
as
ballew
was.
i
believe
burch
had
other
justifications
and
other
reasons
for
the
burch
decision.
mr.
thomas
chester
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
chester
it
could
be
both
ways.
mr.
thomas
chester
now,
as
i
spoke
earlier,
once
we
have
established
that
the
rule
with
which
we
are
dealing
is
not
so
grounded
in
fundamental
fairness
as
is,
say,
the
right
to
counsel
or
reasonable
doubt,
like
in
hankerson
v.
north
carolina,
then
it
becomes
appropriate
to
apply
countervailing
factors
to
the
analysis,
factors
that
were
first
set
out
in
linkletter,
later
in
stovall
and
those
cases
progeny.
as
to
the
reliance
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
role
of
an
inquiry
before
the
court
is
should
the
state
be
charged
with
having
anticipated
the
court's
ruling
in
burch,
and
the
state
would
submit
that
it
should
not.
first,
we
are
dealing
with
an
institution
which
was
provided
for
by
the
louisiana
constitution.
this
is
not
a
juris
prudential
rule.
it
is
not
merely
a
statutory
rule.
normally,
the
constitutions
of
the
states
are
presumed
to
have
some
validity.
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
as
i
said
earlier,
has
seemed
to
examine
the
composition
of
the
jury
question
in
terms
of
absolute
number
rather
than
in
terms
of
the
final
vote.
the
issue
involved
in
burch
had
not
raised
long
and
widespread
attacks
in
the
lower
courts
as
did
the
court's
fifth
amendment
decision
in
bruton
which
was
made
retroactive
by
roberts
v.
russell.
further,
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
court's
decision
in
burch
can
be
said
to
have
been
foreshadowed
or
preordained
as
had
been
the
confrontation
clause
rule
of
barber
v.
page
by
this
court's
previous
decision
in
pointer
v.
texas.
finally,
again
burch
by
its
own
terms
at
several
points
noted
that
the
issue
was
a
close
one.
as
to
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice,
the
third
factor
which
was
identified
in
stovall,
is
noted
in
the
state's
brief
that
a
number
of
serious
felonies
have
been
traditionally
tried
by
juries,
tried
by
non-unanimity
six-man
juries.
this
institution,
incidentally,
was
in
effect
for
a
little
over
four
years,
from
january
1,
1974
until
the
date
of
burch.
crime
such
as
aggravated
battery,
possession
of
narcotics,
burglary,
forgery,
theft,
possession
of
stolen
property
are
among
the
most
common
prosecutions
that
are
held
in
criminal
courts
in
the
state
of
louisiana
or
probably
anywhere.
mr.
thomas
chester
before
1975,
it
was
five
out
of
five
to
convict
for
felonies
which
were
not
necessarily
punishable
by
hard
labor.
mr.
thomas
chester
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
chester
the
difference
being
that
in
georgia
i
believe
that
the
maximum
sentence
for
a
five
out
of
five
conviction
in
georgia
was
one
year
whereas
in
louisiana
it
would
have
been
nine,
possibly
being
enhanced
by
the
multiple
offender
statute.
prior
to
1975
and
after
1975,
potentially
a
man
that
had
prior
felony
convictions,
as
had
petitioner
darnell
brown,
could
possibly
be
sentenced
up
to
life
imprisonment.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
burch
is
a
stronger
for
prospective
application
than
ballew
is.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir,
the
1921
constitution.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
i'm
not
sure
what
type
of
jury
was
before
that.
mr.
thomas
chester
i
don't
know
how
many
of
those
people
would
still
be
in
jail,
your
honor.
i
know
between
'74
and
'75
the
department
of
corrections
estimates
that
there
are
about
2,000
people
currently
in
jail
who
were
either
convicted,
pled
guilty
or
convicted
by
a
judge
or
a
jury
or
who
pled
guilty.
so
you
are
talking
about
2,000
people
who
were
convicted
--
mr.
thomas
chester
i
would
say
we
have
guilty
pleas
in
more
than
half
of
the
cases.
but
what
is
important
to
note
is
that
the
people
who
would
be
most
affected
would
be
people
with
the
longest
and
most
serious
criminal
records.
those
are
the
men
who
usually
do
go
to
trial
because
they
are
facing
too
much
time
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
thomas
chester
we
proceed
with
a
bill
of
information
after
a
man
has
been
convicted
or
pled
guilty
to
a
felony,
we
proceed
by
filing
a
bill
of
information
alleging
that
he
has
been
previously
convicted
of
one
or
more
felonies
within
a
statutory
time
period.
generally
speaking,
it
is
five
years
from
the
time
of
his
last
conviction.
mr.
thomas
chester
it
is
put
in
issue
--
what
happens
is
it
is
--
mr.
thomas
chester
it
is
after
conviction.
the
jury
doesn't
know
about
the
man's
prior
record.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
and
it
is
tried
before
a
judge.
mr.
thomas
chester
it
would
depend
on
the
scope
of
the
retroactive
ruling.
i
believe
it
would.
that
would
be
a
matter
i
guess
for
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
my
opinion
would
be
yes,
it
would.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
chester
discretion
of
the
district
attorney.
i
believe
mr.
lawrence
spoke
about
since
1974
there
have
been
more
multiple
bills
filed,
that
is
because
a
new
district
attorney
came
into
office
in
'74.
so
louisiana
has
had
the
multiple
sentence
statute
since
the
early
1900's.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
there
are
certain
technical
requisites
of
proof
that
require
the
state
to
prove
up
the
prior
convictions.
now,
as
the
court
has
recognized,
a
retroactive
application
of
this
case
could
have
--
could
yield
windfall
benefits
to
a
certain
number
of
people
who
are
in
jail.
ironically,
the
retrial
of
a
case
now
may
well
result
in
a
verdict
which
is
less
reliable
than
was
the
original
trial
held
before
the
court's
decision
in
burch.
that
is
when
a
case
can
be
brought
back
to
trial.
inevitably,
the
passage
of
time
will
destroy
the
state's
chances
for
bringing
a
lot
of
these
cases
back
to
trial.
how
many,
you
can't
tell,
but
again
what
is
important
is
that
those
persons
who
would
be
most
likely
to
be
unretriable
would
be
those
persons
whose
cases
were
the
stalest,
that
is,
people
with
the
most
serious
criminal
records
who
were
sentenced
to
the
longest
terms
a
good
number
of
years
back.
mr.
lawrence
initially
also
brought
up
in
his
argument
a
distinction
between
retroactivity
on
direct
review
and
on
collateral
review,
and
i
would
like
to
answer
that
briefly.
i
think
that
first
that
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court
has
established
that
that
distinction
is
without
merit
back
to
tehan
and
ex
rel.
shott
soon
after
the
first
non-retroactivity
decision
in
linkletter.
that
distinction
was
rejected
then.
i
believe
that
the
countervailing
factors
which
spoke
about
earlier
in
connection
with
the
stovall
decision
don't
admit
any
distinction
between
cases
on
direct
review
and
cases
on
collateral
review.
mr.
thomas
chester
had
not
come
out,
your
honor.
what
happened
--
mr.
thomas
chester
yes,
sir.
there
was
a
trial;
nine
months
later
burch
was
decided.
he
appealed
and
a
month
after
the
burch
decision
the
louisiana
supreme
court
affirmed
darnell
brown's
case,
holding
that
burch
v.
louisiana
was
not
retroactive.
mr.
thomas
chester
petitioner
brown
could
be
on
direct
review.
mr.
thomas
chester
additionally,
i
would
submit
that
i
think
that
the
impetus
behind
the
argument
for
this
distinction
is
basically
one
of
inequity.
it
is
dissatisfaction
with
what
the
court
has
previously
termed
chance
beneficiary.
in
other
words,
why
should
one
man
benefit
from
the
court's
decision
which
[illegible
words]
similarly
situated
does
not.
view
merely
exchanges
our
inequity
for
the
other,
with
the
side
effect
of
having
just
that
many
more
convictions
reversed
for
reasons
than
unfairness
in
the
original
trial.
mr.
thomas
chester
no,
sir,
this
would
be
in
more
general
terms
--
mr.
thomas
chester
it
certainly
would.
some
persons
who
in
fact
may
have
been
convicted
by
non-unanimous
juries
may
not
be
able
to
prove
that.
mr.
thomas
chester
exactly,
maybe
--
mr.
thomas
chester
that
is
perfectly
correct.
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
chester
well,
there
is
a
rule
in
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
which
says
that
jurors
are
incompetent
to
[illegible
word]
their
own
[illegible
words]
whether
that
would
[illegible
words].
mr.
thomas
chester
the
practical
problems
inherent
that
are
widespread.
first
of
all
--
mr.
thomas
chester
exactly,
your
honor.
it
would
be
analogous
to
the
situation
of
trying
to
rediscover
state
witnesses
in
a
case
that
was
five
or
six
or
seven
years
old.
some
of
the
witnesses
or
jurors
may
be
dead
or
may
have
moved.
they
may
have
forgotten
what
their
vote
was.
the
practical
problems,
sir,
are
overwhelming
in
that
type
of
situation.
in
summary,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
has
been
no
showing
that
a
substantial
number
of
these
verdicts
were
wrongly
decided
or
were
unfair.
the
state
of
louisiana
relied
on
the
law
as
it
stood
before
the
court's
decision
in
burch,
as
it
was
set
out
in
the
'74
constitution,
and
finally
if
retroactivity
were
found
in
the
case
before
the
bar
it
would
have
a
seriously
disruptive
impact
on
louisiana's
criminal
laws.
it
would
be
time-consuming,
it
would
be
expensive,
and
it
would
yield
unfair
results.
mr.
thomas
chester
no,
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
thomas
chester
not
with
me,
your
honor.
thank
you.
