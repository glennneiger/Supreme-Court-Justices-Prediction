chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
79-5364,
brown
v.
louisiana.
mr.
lawrence,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
which
case
did
we
define
or
at
least
tried
to
give
some
guidance
on
retroactivity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
do
you
say
is
the
better
truth-finding
process,
a
jury
of
five,
which
must
be
unanimous,
or
a
jury
of
six
in
which
the
conviction
may
be
had
by
five
out
of
six?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
is
which
do
you
think
is
likely
to
be
the
more
accurate
truth-finding
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is
unanimity
with
five
or
non-unanimity
with
six.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
see
no
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
the
six
and
non-unanimity
you
have
at
least
a
challenger
in
the
jury
room.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
some
advantage
to
that
in
the
truth-finding
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ballew
was
simply
a
line-drawing
process,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
nothing
magic
about
five
or
six
or
seven
except
that
the
court
concluded
that
the
line
had
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn't
24
be
even
better
from
your
point
of
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thirty-six?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unanimous
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fifth
circuit
can
decide
a
case
13-to-12.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
chester.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
of
your
friend's
clients
would
be
in
the
other
category
because
he
polls
the
jury
on
every
guilty
verdict.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
to
clear
up
any
possible
misunderstanding,
i
notice
one
of
the
briefs
recites
the
ballew
case
as
1975
which
struck
some
of
us
as
being
incorrect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
'78.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
issue
here,
whether
there
was
any
miscarriage
of
justice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
your
earlier
reference
to
the
inherent
inequity
related
to
the
inability
to
show
that
a
polling
took
place
of
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
that
be
another
basis
for
chance
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
maybe
they
never
knew
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel
didn't
take
the
precautions
what
your
friend
did.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
louisiana,
can
you
establish
such
a
factor
by
some
collateral
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
would
be
impeaching
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lawrence,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
maybe
make
a
pass
at
a
twelve-member
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
thank
you
for
your
candor
on
that.
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question,
counsel.
what
about
the
point
we
were
just
discussing
with
your
friend,
that
a
good
many
lawyers
apparently
did
not
take
the
precautions
you
did
and
poll
every
jury
on
a
guilty
verdict.
isn't
it
just
a
matter
of
lottery
and
chance
as
to
which
ones
would
get
the
benefit
of
a
retroactive
holding
should
that
be
the
court's
decision?
that
is
a
pretty
chancy
business,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
a
matter
of
chance,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
on
what
standards
in
louisiana,
if
there
are
any
on
this
point,
would
a
defense
counsel
be
open
to
a
charge
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
if
the
record
did
not
show
that
he
polled
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
a
fanciful
possible
claim,
is
it,
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
who
is
in
prison
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
friend
suggested
that
there
is
a
statute
prohibiting
collateral
attack
on
the
jury
verdict
by
such
an
inquiry.
wouldn't
that
preclude
any
inquiry
of
any
juror?
because
certainly
the
result
would
be
to
impeach
the
verdict.
that
would
be
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fact
is
that
it
was
not
unanimous
when
the
verdict
has
been
impeached.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
