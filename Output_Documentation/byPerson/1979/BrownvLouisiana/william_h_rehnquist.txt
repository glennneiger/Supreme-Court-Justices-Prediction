justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
was
it
this
court's
statement
that
it
should
be
a
ten-to-one
ratio?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
any
statistics
as
to
numbers
that
would
be
affected?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
there
are
two
elements
really
in
the
jury
competition.
you
say
it
is
the
truthfulness
of
the
fact-finding
process,
but
many
of
our
resent
decisions
going
down
in
numbers
of
jurors
have
emphasized
the
necessity
of
the
cross-section
and
that
you
have
to
draw
an
arbitrary
line
to
preserve
a
right
to
jury
trial,
without
ever
suggesting
that
a
bench
trial
by
a
single
judge
is
not
an
accurate
truth-finding
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
someone
who
was
sentenced
to
22
years
in
1976
might
be
out

1976.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
population
of
orleans
parish?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
over
a
million?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
by
practice,
not
by
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
questions
of
law,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
i
ask
you,
in
the
state's
brief,
on
page
27,
it
says
in
the
case
of
an
habitual
felon,
a
conviction
by
a
six-man
jury
can
ultimately
result
in
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
some
instances,
if
there
is
a
poll
taken,
i
take
it
it
doesn't
necessarily
show
up
on
the
court
minutes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
population
of
the
state
of
louisiana?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
idea
of
the
population
of
the
state
as
a
whole?
three,
four
million?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i
was
getting
at
was
what
the
population
of
the
state
of
louisiana
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
no
figures
nor
any
idea
how
many
people
might
still
be
in
jail
who
were
convicted
by
five-member
juries
prior
to
1975?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
louisiana
system
for
multiple
billing,
as
your
opponent
has
been
referring
to
it.
is
it
something
that
has
to
be
alleged
in
the
--
is
it
an
indictment
that
you
proceed
by
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
that
is
an
allegation
in
the
bill
that
can
be
put
in
issue
by
a
not
guilty
plea,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
would
retroactivity
here
subject
a
person
who
was
convicted
by
a
unanimous
six-man
jury,
would
it
give
him
the
right
to
attack
a
prior
conviction,
say,
back
to
1921?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
conceivably
this
court,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
[illegible
word]
back
jurors
of
five
or
six
years
ago
and
ask
them
whether
or
not
a
particular
verdict
was,
in
the
words
of
the
usual
polling
language,
was
this
your
verdict
