justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
could
i
just
ask
one
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
government's
brief
they
quote
the
1976
attorneys
fee
act
as
well
as
the
provision
of
the
'64
act.
is
that
statute
involved
in
the
case
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
meyerson,
could
i
follow
up
on
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
taking
the
view
that
the
word
"court"
in
706(k)
describes
a
federal
court
and
not
a
state
court,
because
i
gather
there
is
judicial
review
of
the
state
proceeding,
is
there
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the
word
"court"
just
talks
to
federal
court,
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
inconsistent
for
you
to
say
the
word
"proceeding"
which
is
in
the
same
phrase
refers
to
state
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
separate
proceedings,
or
is
the
state
proceeding
a
part
of
the
federal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
proceeding
before
the
new
york
court
on
review
a
part
of
the
federal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
is
not
the
new
york
court
a
court
referred
to
in
this
sentence,
and
why
doesn't
that
court
then
have
the
power
by
virtue
of
the
federal
statute
to
award
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
if
any
action
or
proceeding
under
this
title,
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
allow
fees
as
part
of
the
costs.
i
understand
that
probably
the
new
york
court
could
allow
costs,
but
you
say
it
couldn't
allow
fees
as
part
of
those
costs
even
though
the
proceeding
that
is
referred
to
is
part
of
the
federal
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
if
we
affirm
in
this
case,
then
the
new
york
courts
could
allow
fees
in
the
state
proceeding.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understood
you
to
take
a
contrary
view
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
federal
court
isn't
compelled
to.
it
may
allow
it.
it
is
a
grant
of
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
your
knowledge
--
this
is
a
'64
statute
and
the
first
time
we're
getting
this
problem,
some
sixteen
years
later.
has
anyone
argued
in
the
new
york
courts
to
your
knowledge
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
a
prevailing
party
in
a
new
york
proceeding,
a
new
york
sub-part
of
the
federal
proceeding
is
entitled
to
fees
awarded
by
new
york
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
it
be
more
efficient
to
have
it
done
as
part
of
the
new
york
aspect,
rather
than
starting
a
new
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
interrupt
you,
please.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
is
clear
she
is
the
prevailing
party.
doesn't
that
kind
of
beg
the
question?
the
question
of
whether
she
is
the
prevailing
party
in
the
proceeding
referred
to
in
the
statute,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
tell
that
until
you
know
what
proceeding
we
are
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
reverse,
she
won't
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
issue
in
the
federal
action
is
the
right
to
fees,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
having
prevailed
in
the
new
york
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
she
would
be
the
prevailing
party
in
the
state
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
you
are
right,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
start
out
by
saying
we
all
agree,
she
is
the
prevailing
party
in
the
federal
proceeding,
because
then
you
are
saying
that
the
state
proceeding
is
part
of
the
federal
proceeding.
maybe
you
are
right,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
significance
of
the
words
"prevailing
party"
is
whether
they
are
the
prevailing
party
within
the
meaning
of
this
section
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
she
had
gone
first
to
the
state
agency
before
she
ever
went
to
eeoc
and
was
turned
down
and
then
to
eeoc,
let's
just
assume
that
the
time
limits
could
be
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
--
and
then
if
she
went
to
the
eeoc
then
and
eventually
got
a
right
to
sue
letter
and
sued,
she
couldn't
get
attorneys
fees
for
having
gone
to
the
state
