justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
proujansky,
you
just
referred
to
the
commencement
of
this
action,
i
believe.
as
one
reads
through
the
'64
federal
act
and
the
'76
attorneys
fee
amendment,
you
read
the
terms
"action"
or
"proceedings"
and
"actions"
--
do
you
think
that
congress
was
extremely
careful
and
precise
in
the
terms
it
chose
as
between
"actions"
and
"proceedings"
and
"commencement"
in
those
various
acts,
or
do
you
think
that
it
may
have
occasionally
simply
used
one
as
the
synonym
for
another?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
passed
in
'38
and
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
a
congress
sitting
in
'64
or
'76
might
not
have
used
somewhat
more
ambiguous
language
and
still
meant
the
same
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
read
the
second
circuit's
opinion
as
holding
that
if
the
respondent
here
had
simply
gone
before
the
new
york
human
relations
commission
and
appealed
to
the
new
york
courts
and
never
filed
an
eeoc
complaint
that
nonetheless
state
courts
of
new
york
would
have
been
obligated
to
award
her
attorneys
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
because
the
filing
in
the
federal
court
that
brings
into
play
the
'76
amendment,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
meyerson,
let
me
put
to
you
the
same
question
i
put
to
your
opponent.
supposing
this
proceeding
had
never
gone
into
federal
court
at
all
and
simply
had
been
a
proceeding
before
the
new
york
human
rights
commission
and
then
an
appeal
for
review
through
the
new
york
courts.
do
you
think
that
the
'64
act
of
congress
authorizing
attorneys
fees
would
have
required
the
new
york
courts
to
award
attorneys
fees
if
new
york
did
not
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
law
award
them
under
its
own
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
even
if
the
complainant
never
calls
it
to
the
attention
of
the
eeoc
and
the
state
human
rights
division
never
calls
it
to
the
attention
of
the
eeoc,
title
vii
requires
that
it
go
automatically?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
pursuant
to
act
of
congress
but
i
take
it
that
new
york's
procedure
of
advising
the
eeoc
is
not
pursuant
to
any
act
of
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
assume
there
is
no
provision
in
title
vii
that
requires
new
york
to
make
known
to
the
eeoc
if
no
filing
is
made
with
eeoc,
would
you
still
say
that
the
title
vii
provision
for
attorneys
fees
requires
new
york
state
courts
to
award
attorneys
fees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
title
vii
wouldn't
require
them
to
do
that
if
it
never
got
into
federal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
title
vii
provide
that
an
employer
who
relies
in
good
faith
on
a
ruling
of
the
eeoc
is
not
subject
to
liability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
my
impression
--
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
does,
would
you
say
that
congress
intended
that
to
apply
to
new
york
proceedings,
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
state
administrative
proceeding,
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
in
this
case
then
the
employer
had
come
into
the
new
york
human
rights
proceeding
and
said,
look,
eeoc
under
title
vii
issued
a
ruling
saying
this
was
not
discriminatory,
i
relied
on
it,
and
even
though
i
am
in
a
new
york
proceeding
and
i've
never
filed
a
federal
complaint,
the
federal
law
controls
and
you
have
no
business
ordering
reinstatement.
do
you
think
congress
intended
to
reach
that
far
into
the
state
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
are
you
penalizing
her
other
than
requiring
her
to
resort
to
state
court
process?
