ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
clear
in
this
case
that
ms.
carey
is
the
prevailing
party.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
way
in
which
she
prevailed
somehow
deprives
her
of
attorneys
fees
under
section
706(k).
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
there
are
two
rationale
for
reaching
that
result.
the
narrowest
reading
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
she
is
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that
is
my
point.
she
is
the
prevailing
party
in
the
federal
action
under
the
narrowest
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
in
the
federal
action
she
came
into
the
federal
action
while
she
was
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
she
had
prevailed
in
the
new
york
proceeding
because
at
the
time
she
filed
her
federal
statute
she
had
gotten
an
affirmative
award
from
the
state
administrative
agency.
the
petitioners
had
then
appealed
that,
she
was
still
before
the
state
appeal
board,
she
then
had
to
go
into
the
state
courts,
she
had
won
along
the
way.
she
hadn't
reached
the
end
of
the
road
in
the
state
proceedings.
so
when
she
went
into
the
federal
court,
the
gaslight
club
agreed
that
if
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
refused
to
hear
the
case,
they
would
then
pay
her
her
back
pay
and
offer
her
employment.
it
was
in
effect
a
settlement
and
so
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
and
in
the
federal
proceeding.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
what
i
am
saying
is
that
she
is
the
prevailing
party
overall.
she
is
either
the
prevailing
party
in
the
federal
proceeding
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
but
clearly
she
is
the
prevailing
party.
the
first
point
is
that
she
is
the
prevailing
party
in
the
federal
proceedings,
and
under
any
reading
of
706
that
means
that
she
is
entitled
to
attorneys
fees.
if
you
don't
agree
that
she
is
the
prevailing
party
in
the
federal
proceeding,
or
if
you
want
to
approach
the
statute
under
the
way
that
we
think
is
preferable,
it
is
enough
that
she
is
the
prevailing
party
in
the
state
proceeding.
in
the
state
proceedings,
they
are
for
the
reasons
that
mr.
meyerson
explained
and
as
are
explained
in
our
brief,
they
are
proceedings
under
title
vii.
there
is
such
a
close
integration
that
she
is
--
the
fact
that
she
prevailed
in
the
state
proceedings
means
that
she
is
the
prevailing
party
under
title
vii.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
think
it
depends.
as
i
understood
mr.
rehnquist's
question,
he
was
saying
supposing
she
had
simply
gone
into
the
state
courts,
gone
into
the
state
administrative
agency,
gone
through
the
state
courts,
had
never
filed
a
charge
under
title
vii.
in
that
case,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
this
would
be
a
title
vii
proceeding
at
all.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
all
right.
as
modified
by
these
facts,
she
files
her
eeoc
charge,
then
she
goes
into
the
--
well,
it
is
deferred
to
the
state
and
ultimately
she
gets
into
the
state
court.
i
think
it
is
arguable
that
the
state
court
could
award
her
fees
on
the
theory
that
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
state
proceeding
--
certainly
the
state
proceeding
is
a
part
of
the
federal
proceeding
and
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
carey
is
a
title
vii
plaintiff
because
she
filed
a
charge
with
the
eeoc
under
title
vii
and
was
required
by
title
vii
to
go
to
the
state
agency
for
the
relief
in
the
first
instance.
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
state
administrative
agency
or
state
courts
are
enforcing
title
vii.
they
are
enforcing
the
state
equal
employment
law
and
they
are
simply
within
the
confines
of
the
state
law,
so
that
they
are
not
required
by
title
vii
to
award
attorneys
fees.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
employee,
this
is
part
of
her
route
through
the
state
proceedings
on
her
way
to
the
eeoc
and
ultimately
to
a
court
that
has
jurisdiction
to
enforce
title
vii.
that
almost
always
is
going
to
be
a
federal
court.
she
will
get
her
right
to
sue
letter,
then
she
has
90
days
to
go
into
a
court
with
jurisdiction
to
enforce
title
vii
rights.
arguably
that
could
be
a
state
court.
we
don't
believe
that
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
title
vii
is
exclusively
in
the
federal
courts.
at
any
rate,
she
has
to
get
her
right
to
sue
letter
and
before
she
is
in
a
court
with
jurisdiction
to
enforce
title
vii.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
are
a
few
cases
in
state
courts
holding
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction.
i
gather
there
is
also
one
court
saying
that
there
is
not,
but
the
majority
agree
that
there
is
a
right
to
have
a
state
court
enforce
a
title
vii
action.
our
fundamental
point
is
that
the
statute,
title
vii,
authorizes
any
court
having
jurisdiction
over
a
title
vii
action
to
award
attorneys
fees
for
proceedings
under
title
vii.
the
state
proceedings
here
were
under
title
vii
because
the
employee
was
required
to
resort
to
them
under
that
statutory
scheme,
and
for
that
reason
she
is
entitled
to
attorneys
fees
for
those
proceedings.
the
only
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
it
really
makes
no
sense
to
penalize
a
victim
of
employment
discrimination
simply
because
she
happens
to
live
in
a
deferral
state
and
therefore
has
to
go
to
the
state
agency
first.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
a
vast
majority
of
them
are
deferral
states.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
because
if
she
was
not
in
a
deferral
state,
then
she
would
go
directly
to
the
eeoc,
she
wouldn't
have
to
go
through
the
state
proceedings
and
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--
then
she
would
be
entitled
to
attorneys
fees
from
the
beginning.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right,
it
does
but,
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
has
emphasized
that
when
the
statute
says
may
give
it,
it
means
that
she
is
entitled
absent
specific
circumstances
indicating
that
such
an
award
would
be
unjust.
so
you
are
right,
it
is
not
a
statutory
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
then
she
would
not
be
proceeding
under
title
vii
until
she
went
to
eeoc,
and
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
proceedings
are
under
title
vii
and
the
attorneys
fees
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
our
position,
yes.
she
has
to
get
title
vii
--
she
has
to
first
go
to
the
eeoc
in
order
to
start
the
title
vii
procedures.
thank
you.
