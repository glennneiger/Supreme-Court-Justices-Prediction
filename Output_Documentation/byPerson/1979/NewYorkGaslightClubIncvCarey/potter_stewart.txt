i
suppose
there
are
some
so-called
deferral
states
which
have
an
administrative
system
without
any
intervention
of
state
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
may
be
others
where
it
is
exclusively
an
administrative
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
answer
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question?
could
the
new
york
court
under
this
statute
say
it
has
the
right
to
give
her
fees?
justice
potter
stewart
take
the
question
as
modified
by
these
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
more
than
that?
the
state
proceeding
is
a
part
of
the
federal
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
has
that
ever
been
decided?
has
there
ever
been
a
title
vii
action
brought
in
a
state
court?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
so-called
deferral
states
are
there
now?
justice
potter
stewart
a
vast
majority
are
now
deferrals.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
would
be
no
question
of
her
