mr.
albert
n.
proujansky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
a
novel
one
and
has
not
had
judicial
determination
before
the
determination
made
by
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
which
authorizes
the
award
of
attorneys
fees
as
a
part
of
costs
to
a
prevailing
party,
whether
that
statute
extends
to
state
court
proceedings.
this
case
was
initiated
in
early
1975
by
the
filing
of
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
state
of
new
york
which
has
an
anti-discrimination
statute
and
has
had
one
prior
to
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
under
the
state
statute,
the
hearing
was
held
and
the
complainant
was
awarded
an
affirmative
judgment.
the
employer
was
directed
to
offer
her
an
opportunity
to
accept
employment,
which
was
done,
and
she
is
currently
an
employee
of
the
new
york
gaslight
club,
and
back
pay
to
compensate
her
for
the
loss
of
wages
that
she
sustained
as
a
result
of
the
conduct
found
to
be
violative
of
the
statute,
was
awarded
to
her
and
paid.
while
this
matter
was
proceeding
before
the
state
court
or
before
the
state
civil
rights
division
and
subsequently
the
state
courts,
the
attorney
for
the
complainant
importuned
eeoc
for
the
issuance
of
a
right
to
sue
letter
which
the
eeoc
granted
to
him
in
july
of
1977,
and
in
september
of
1977
he
commenced
an
action
in
federal
court
seeking
to
redress
the
same
grievance
which
was
then
before
the
state
board.
at
that
stage,
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
this
action,
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
right
to
sue
letter,
the
commissioner
of
the
new
york
human
rights
division
had
awarded
relief
to
the
plaintiff,
all
of
the
relief
to
which
she
was
entitled.
mr.
albert
n.
proujansky
i
think
if
your
honor
contrasts
the
language
with
respect
to
attorneys
fees
as
contained
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
with
the
language
that
appears
in
the
civil
rights
act,
we
have
a
difference
between
day
and
night.
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
statute
says
specifically
that
an
action
under
this
act
can
be
maintained
in
federal
or
state
courts
and
any
judgment
shall
include
an
award
of
attorneys
fees
in
addition
to
costs.
now,
the
statute
--
mr.
albert
n.
proujansky
it
is
hard
to
determine
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind.
there
is
very
little
legislative
history,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
with
respect
to
section
706(a).
but
if
we
look
at
the
purpose
and
the
procedure
of
the
two
statutes
contrasting
the
federal
procedure
with
the
state
procedure,
perhaps
some
insight
will
flow
therefrom.
under
the
eeoc,
assuming
we
have
--
the
state
of
new
york
had
no
anti
discrimination
statute.
a
complaint
would
be
filed
before
the
eeoc,
no
hearing
would
be
held
and
investigation
would
be
conducted
by
the
eeoc
and
then
either
the
commission
itself
or
would
commence
an
action
under
federal
court
and
it
would
by
a
right
to
sue
letter
authorize
the
complaint
into
commence
and
action
in
the
courts.
the
statute
that
we
are
dealing
with
706
(k)
follows
closely
after
a
number
of
sections
dealing
solely
with
procedural
or
as
distinguish
from
substantive
matters.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
attorney's
fees,
and
only
this
morning
judge
powell
announced
the
decision
in
which
he
noted
that
the
american
rule
is
that
attorney's
fees
are
not
normally
paid,
it
depends
upon
the
existence
of
the
statutory
exception.
now
it
is
most
unusual
for
congress
to
pass
a
low
with
respect
to
of
course
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
in
any
of
the
individual
state.
had
congress
intended
that
attorneys
fees
as
a
part
of
course
that
was
the
language
of
the
statute,
was
to
be
applied
in
state
court
proceedings,
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
should
have
made
clear
its
intent
so
to
do
and
absence
such
indication
i
draw
the
consequent
inference
that
congress
did
not
intent
this
statute
to
apply
the
state
court
proceedings.
the
whole
--
all
of
the
proceedings
sections
fghjk
relate
solely
to
matters
dealing
with
federal
court
proceedings.
mr.
albert
n.
proujansky
as
i
read
--
mr.
albert
n.
proujansky
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
read
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision,
they
framed
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
an
attorney
is
entitled
to
compensation
for
services
rendered
in
a
state
court
proceeding.
as
i
read
their
decision,
they
authorized
the
commencement
of
a
suit
in
the
federal
courts
solely
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
attorneys
fees,
even
if
the
matter
has
been
successfully
concluded
in
the
state
courts.
they
have
extended
706(k)
far
beyond
what
i
think
congress
intended
it
to
be
extended.
there
is
no
need,
in
my
view,
for
that
extension.
the
human
rights
law
functioned
very
satisfactorily
in
new
state
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
judge
monticello
in
the
lopino
case,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief
at
a
lower
stage
referred
to
the
fact
"the
state
division
has
a
staff
of
competent
attorneys
to
aid
potential
claimants
and
thus
it
is
not
necessary
to
retain
private
counsel
to
obtain
relief
from
that
agency.
"a
hearing
is
conducted
before
the
new
york
state
agency,
the
hearing
officer
develops
a
record
with
or
without
counsel.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
principal
witness,
mr.
john
anderson,
who
testified
in
this
case.
the
cross-examination
by
the
complainant's
counsel
took
eleven
pages
of
stenographic
minutes,
the
interrogation
by
the
hearing
officer
took
23
pages
of
stenographic
minutes.
the
human
rights
division
in
new
york
functions
very
well
and
adequately
protects
complainants,
and
i
am
totally
appalled
as
a
citizen
of
new
york
state
by
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
amicus
brief
which
he
filed
in
this
case,
where
he
totally
denigrates
the
activities
or
the
ability
of
the
state
human
rights
commission
to
function
adeuqately.
i
think
he
should
be
here
standing
up
for
the
state
of
new
york.
in
fact,
if
there
is
anything
wrong
with
the
manner
in
which
the
human
rights
commission
functions,
why
isn't
the
attorney
general
paying
attention
to
what
the
human
rights
commission
is
doing,
instead
of
saying
no,
we
need
the
intervention
of
attorneys
because
new
york
has
a
fiscal
problem,
and
this
is
going
to
save
it
some
money.
i
don't
think
these
principles
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
fiscal
problems
of
the
state
of
new
york.
moreover,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
under
706(k),
7o6(k)
which
to
some
extent
uses
the
same
language
as
section
54
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
refers
to
attorneys
fees
being
awarded
to
a
prevailing
party.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
ms.
carey
was
the
prevailing
party
in
the
state
courts,
but
ms.
carey
was
not
the
prevailing
party
in
the
federal
court.
the
federal
court
action
was
dismissed
as
moot,
with
the
consent
of
ms.
carey's
counsel.
the
only
thing
that
was
retained
was
that
part
of
the
cause
of
action
which
sought
to
recover
attorneys
fees.
now,
this
whole
procedure
that
has
been
adopted
here
was
one
that
was
calculated
to
get
to
this
point
where
the
attorney
for
ms.
carey
can
get
attorneys
fees.
under
the
provisions
of
title
vii,
a
complaint
should
be
filed
in
the
state
--
with
a
state
agency
if
the
state
has
an
agency
which
provides
for
redress
against
discrimination.
that
was
not
done.
the
complaint
was
initially
filed
before
the
eeoc.
after
the
plaintiff
had
won
at
the
first
stage
of
the
proceedings
before
the
state
human
rights
division,
counsel
for
ms.
carey
began
to
importune
the
eeoc
to
issue
a
right
to
sue
letter.
ultimately
that
right
to
sue
letter
was
granted
in
july
of
1977.
in
august
of
1977,
the
employers
appealed
to
the
human
rights
appeal
board
and
resulted
in
an
affirmance
of
the
earlier
decision
of
the
commissioner
of
human
rights.
on
september
30th,
ms.
carey
commenced
an
action
in
federal
court.
at
stage
stage,
virtually
at
the
same
time
that
the
action
was
commenced
in
federal
court,
counsel
for
the
employer
filed
a
petition
for
review
in
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
this
review
resulted
on
november
3,
1977
in
an
affirmance.
thereafter,
leave
to
appeal
was
sought
and
was
denied,
and
the
matter
was
closed
as
far
as
the
state
courts
were
concerned.
the
award
made
was
satisfied,
the
complainant
was
hired.
the
question
has
arisen
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
or
not
in
making
an
interpretation
of
706(k)
we
are
saddling
the
federal
courts
and
the
federal
agencies
with
a
great
deal
of
work
by
awarding
attorneys
fees
or
are
we
lessening
their
burden
by
denying
attorneys
fees.
if
this
case
is
any
example,
in
an
effort
to
obtain
attorneys
fees,
they
have
involved
unnecessarily
the
eeoc
in
this
case,
they
have
involved
the
federal
courts
unnecessarily
in
this
case.
the
question
of
attorneys
fees
is
a
matter,
as
judge
morgan
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
"it
seems
to
me
to
be
fundamental
that
remuneration
of
private
counsel
successful
in
state
agency
and
state
judicial
proceedings
in
vindicating
rights
under
state
law
should
be
determined
by
the
law
of
the
state
which
established
the
substantive
right,
created
the
agency
and
provided
for
judicial
review."
i
have
serious
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
if
this
statute
be
construed
to
impose
costs
in
state
court
proceedings,
whether
it
does
not
run
a
foul
of
the
tenth
amendment
which
reserves
to
the
states
the
rights
to
control
their
courts
and
procedures.
i
wish
to
point
out
further
that
when
the
1964
act
was
enacted,
congress
knew
what
the
procedure
would
be
in
a
federal
court
and
they
knew
because
they
were
establishing
an
appropriate
procedure,
they
knew
whether
costs
or
attorneys
fees
should
be
awarded,
whether
there
was
a
need
for
attorneys
fees
to
be
awarded.
but
in
1964
there
were
very
few
state
anti-discrimination
statutes
and
congress
did
not
set
out
any
procedural
safeguards
as
to
the
method
in
which
anti-discrimination
claims
should
be
prosecuted.
this
was
left
to
the
various
states
to
determine.
conceivably,
many
of
the
states,
as
does
new
york,
provide
some
alternative
means
in
lieu
of
awarding
attorneys
fees.
if
those
means
--
those
means
may
or
may
not
be
adequate,
but
i
suggest
that
that
is
a
matter
that
ought
to
be
left
to
the
several
states.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
albert
n.
proujansky
surely,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
n.
proujansky
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
section
1988
of
the
u.s.
code
does
not
pertain
to
title
vii
actions.
i
assume
there
was
no
necessity
for
extending
that
to
title
vii
because
the
language
is
virtually
identical
with
the
title
vii
statute.
mr.
albert
n.
proujansky
just
a
few
words
if
i
may,
sir.
i
think
the
concept
that
the
federal
and
state
statutes
are
integrated
is
erroneous.
senator
dirksen
and
senator
humphrey
were
the
cosponsors
of
the
state
deferral
section.
the
course
of
the
debates
on
this
section,
senator
dirksen
said
this
section
was
enacted
to
keep
primary
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
hands
of
the
state
commission
for
a
sufficient
period
of
time
to
let
them
work
out
their
own
problems
at
the
local
level.
the
federal
statute
is
intended
as
a
standby
only
in
the
event
that
the
state
system
does
not
work.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
instead
of
going
to
the
state
as
the
statute
mandates,
the
complainant
went
to
the
eeoc
and
they
in
turn
deferred
her
to
the
state.
the
right
to
sue
letter
which
triggered
or
necessitated
the
commencement
of
the
action
in
the
federal
court
to
preserve
the
plaintiff's
rights
was
solicited
by
counsel
for
the
plaintiff,
and
the
record
contains
letters
between
counsel
and
eeoc
requesting
a
right
to
sue
letter.
i
disagree
with
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general.
there
was
no
need
ever
for
ms.
carey
to
have
a
title
vii
complaint.
all
the
relief
that
she
was
entitled
to
she
obtained
from
the
state
agency.
there
was
no
need
and,
as
judge
werker
pointed
out
below,
the
right
to
sue
letter
issued
by
the
eeoc
after
the
state
had
awarded
affirmative
relief
and
during
the
time
of
the
appeal
was
unwise
and
did
not
justify
the
award
of
attorneys
fees
in
this
particular
case.
thank
you.
