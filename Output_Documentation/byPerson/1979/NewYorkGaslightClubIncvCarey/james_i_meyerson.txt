mr.
james
i.
meyerson
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
james
meyerson,
and
i
represent
the
respondent,
mr.
carey,
in
this
matter.
there
are
several
points
which
i
would
like
to
elaborate
upon
to
the
court
in
order
to
be
in
proper
focus
to
the
case.
i
think
at
the
outset
we
should
recognize
that
the
petitioners
were
found
to
violate
the
new
york
state
human
rights
law
in
that
they
discriminated
against
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
because
of
her
race
in
employment
opportunity,
and
in
so
finding
upon
a
deferral
by
the
federal
agency
authorized
by
congress
to
enforce
the
anti-discrimination
law,
the
state
of
new
york
in
that
proceeding
in
effect
enforced
the
policy
enacted
by
congress
in
1964
to
end
discrimination
based
on
race,
among
other
things,
in
employment.
it
is
a
policy
that
has
uniform
application
throughout
the
united
states
of
america,
and
it
is
a
policy
that
in
1964
the
united
states
congress
gave
its
highest
priorities
to
and
which
this
court
has
so
acknowledged
in
many
of
the
decisions
that
have
interpreted
title
vii
since
its
inception.
deferral
to
the
state
division
of
human
rights
was
envisioned
by
the
united
states
congress
as
an
integral
part
of
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
policy.
it
is
in
effect
an
extension
of
the
federal
proceeding.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
well,
in
response,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
only
way
in
which
the
respondent
in
this
case
got
into
federal
court
was
as
a
consequence
of
securing
a
right
to
sue
letter
from
the
eeoc.
the
situation
which
you
posture,
sir,
i
do
not
believe
could
occur
because
at
the
time
a
complaint
is
filed
with
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights,
assuming
arguendo
is
filed
there
before
the
eeoc,
there
will
be
an
automatic
slide
of
that
complaint
sixty
days
thereafter
or
perhaps
even
sooner
to
the
eeoc,
representing
precisely
the
issue
that
is
in
focus
here,
the
significant
interrelationship
between
that
state
proceeding
and
the
federal
policy
under
title
vii.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i
suggest
to
you
that
once
a
complaint
is
filed
in
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights,
that
is
automatically
kicking
off
the
title
vii
process
because
the
state
division
of
human
rights
automatically
makes
the
eeoc
aware,
as
a
sister-brother
agency,
whatever,
a
deferral
agency,
that
it
has
an
employment
discrimination
matter
pending
before
it
because
it
is
involved
by
contract
and
otherwise
with
the
eeoc,
it
is
obligated
and
does
make
known
to
the
eeoc
the
existence
of
that
complaint,
just
as
in
the
eeoc's
procedures
here
where
ms.
carey
initially
filed
with
the
eeoc,
the
eeoc
made
it
known
to
ms.
carey
and
the
state
division
of
human
rights
that
she
was
to
go
to
the
state
division
of
human
rights
and
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i
would
defer
to
the
united
states
government
in
that
regard.
there
is
a
contractual
relationship
to
the
eeoc
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
no,
the
new
york
state
courts
have
indicated
under
the
human
rights
law
that
attorneys
fees
are
not
proper
and
the
state
legislature
has
not
seen
fit
to
incorporate
into
its
legislation
the
award
of
fees
to
a
successful
prevailing
plaintiff
or
complainant
in
the
state
division,
so
therefore
i
don't
think
the
courts
in
the
state
of
new
york
would
have
the
option
and
they
have
not
seen
fit
to
assume
the
option
of
providing
attorneys
fees
to
a
prevailing
complainant
in
the
division.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
case
in
the
circuit
court
below
superimposes
federal
law
on
the
state
courts.
what
the
case
below
suggest
is
where
the
state
proceeding
is
inadequate,
where
ms.
carey
was
involuntarily
sent
there
--
she
started
out
in
the
federal
agency
--
and
if
the
relief
in
the
state
agency
is
not
satisfactory
to
make
her
whole,
once
she
has
been
--
once
it
has
been
established
that
she
was
discriminated
against
because
of
her
race,
she
has
the
ability,
your
honor,
to
secure
a
right
to
sue
letter
and
seek
the
more
comprehensive
and
complete
relief
that
was
envisioned
by
the
united
states
congress
as
necessary
to
effect
its
anti-discrimination
policy.
i
might
point
out
to
you
that
the
sole
purpose
that
ms.
carey
went
to
the
federal
court
was
not
to
allow
her
attorneys
to
get
fees,
it
was
to
effect
a
complete
relief.
this
court
has
recognized,
based
on
the
congressional
legislative
history
of
title
vii,
that
attorneys
fees
are
designed
to
give
effect
to
the
purpose
of
the
act.
they
act
as
a
deterrent
to
those
who
have
been
found
to
have
discriminated
and
for
those
who
might
seek
to
follow
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
title
vii,
in
terms
of
its
purpose
in
specifically
providing
for
attorneys
fees,
it
is
designed,
as
this
court
has
so
stated
on
numerous
occasions,
to
make
someone
whole,
it
is
to
give
as
complete
relief
as
possible
and
thereby
act
as
a
deterrent
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
import
of
the
question.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
without
doubt,
congress
--
and
i
think
this
court
has
so
recognized
--
drafts
legislation
with
specific
words,
and
this
court
has
acknowledge
that
it
must
give
meaning
to
each
word
in
a
piece
of
legislation
unless
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
intent
of
congress.
congress
set
up
a
multi-step
state-federal
scheme
for
enforcing
title
vii
with
both
state
administrative
and
judicial
processes
and
federal
processes.
it
clearly
envisioned
proceedings
in
addition
to
federal
court
actions.
there
is
legislation
that
congress
has
drafted
in
the
same
1964
civil
rights
act,
title
ii,
which
makes
no
mention
of
proceedings.
that
is
because
title
ii
is
strictly
a
judicial
avenue.
thus,
when
congress
included
proceedings
or
actions
in
light
of
the
multiple
administrative-judicial
scheme
that
it
set
up,
it
clearly
was
envisioning
that
one
would
be
addressing
the
discrimination
in
a
proceeding,
an
administrative
proceeding
as
well
as
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
clearly,
because
congress
mandated
that
there
would
be
involuntary
automatic
deferral
by
the
eeoc
to
a
state
proceeding
where
a
state
forum
existed
for
the
purposes
of
assisting
it,
the
eeoc,
in
enforcing
the
federal
policy.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
no,
i
don't
think
congress
means
to
superimpose
anything
on
the
state
proceeding,
and
i
don't
think
the
second
circuit
does
superimpose
any
federal
law
on
the
state
of
new
york.
what
it
suggests
is
that
as
an
independent
but
related
mechanism
for
securing
complete
relief,
the
prevailing
person
in
this
case
ms.
carey,
who
was
discriminated
against
because
of
race,
who
was
not
able
to
get
all
of
the
relief
envisioned
by
the
congress
under
title
vii,
having
secured
the
necessary
right
to
sue
letter
to
go
into
federal
court
seeking
supplementary
cumulative
comprehensive
relief
that
because
of
the
inadequacy
or
the
limitations
of
the
state
proceeding
she
was
not
able
to
secure.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
in
new
york,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i
might
respond
to
that
this
way,
if
you
go
back
a
little
bit
further
into
the
eeoc
and
to
the
title
vii
legislation
and
look
at
2000(e)(5)(b),
(c)
and
(e),
i
believe,
when
it
is
addressing
the
deferral,
it
refers
to
state
proceedings.
what
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
administrative
proceedings
clearly
envisioned
in
the
legislation.
the
eeoc
is
an
administrative
proceeding
and
the
deferral
state
proceedings,
and
the
congress
clearly
under
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
it
is
clearly
part
of
the
federal
proceeding.
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
legislation,
it
is
an
extension
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i
would
suggest
that
it
is,
yes,
a
part
of
that
proceeding.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
well,
it
refers
to
courts
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
it
couldn't
allow
fees
under
the
human
rights
law.
i
do
believe
that
the
new
york
state
courts,
yes,
could
on
the
precedent
enunciated
in
the
second
circuit
and
hopefully
affirmed
here
could
thereupon
of
its
own
accord
indicate
to
prevailing
complainants
upon
a
review
by
a
failing
employer
that
fees
under
title
vii,
of
which
the
state
proceeding
is
an
integral
part,
are
appropriate.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
under
title
vii,
yes,
even
though
as
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i'm
sorry,
i
was
under
the
impression
that
he
was
talking
about
whether
they
were
compelled
to
do
that.
i
don't
think
they
are
compelled
to
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i
think
the
state
court
could
do
that.
certainly
it
would
not
change
the
state
of
new
york's
basic
position
that
under
the
human
rights
law
itself
it
is
not
necessary
to
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
i
don't
think
it
has
been
argued,
and
we
elected
not
to
argue
it,
your
honor,
because
we
firmly
believe
that
congress
meant
to
allow
us
to
come
into
a
federal
court
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
well,
let
me
suggest
to
you,
your
honor
--
and
i
might
point
out
that
we
were
forced
to
go
into
the
federal
court
in
effect
involuntarily
because
after
we
sustained
our
burden
before
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights
and
the
appeal
board,
which
entered
its
decision
in
august
of
1977,
immediately
thereafter
the
respondents,
on
a
very
questionable
appeal
as
reflected
by
the
absence
of
any
legal
or
factual
discussion
by
the
new
york
courts
on
that
appeal,
was
in
effect
a
perfunctory
affirmance,
immediately
thereafter
went
into
the
new
york
state
courts.
why
they
had
nothing
to
lose
--
no
attorney
fees.
it
was
at
that
point
in
time,
almost
90
days
after
we
had
involuntarily
received
our
right
to
sue
letter,
in
which
i
said
we
had
better
go
into
federal
court,
file
our
complaint
in
case
for
some
reason,
which
i
didn't
anticipate,
the
case
was
reversed
by
the
state
courts.
in
other
words,
it
was
again
the
respondent,
ms.
carey,
being
involuntarily
dragged
into
the
state
court,
as
she
had
been
involuntarily
dragged,
so
to
speak,
into
the
state
proceeding
which
precipitated
the
need
ultimately
for
us
to
go
into
the
federal
court
to
get
the
relief
which
we
would
have
automatically
been
entitled
to
if
we
had
gone
into
and
permitted
to
go
into
the
federal
court
initially.
in
other
words,
if
we
were
not
in
a
deferral
state,
your
honor
--
and
you
must
remember
that
congress
envisioned
a
uniform
policy
throughout
this
country
--
if
we
weren't
in
a
deferral
state,
having
filed
my
eeoc
complaint
on
behalf
of
ms.
carey,
we
would
have
gone
after
90
days
or
60
days
or
180
days,
whatever
the
appropriate
time
period,
into
federal
court.
having
filed
an
eeoc
complaint
in
a
deferral
state,
we
were
compelled
pursuant
to
that
statute,
in
order
to
enforce
the
policy
of
that
statute,
to
go
into
new
york.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
there
may
very
well
be.
in
reading
the
amicus
brief,
i
believe
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
state
human
rights
division,
i
do
believe
there
is
only
one
state
where
deferral
takes
place
where
fees
are
authorized.
i
believe
that
is
the
state
of
alaska.
so
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
our
position
in
effect
is
that
at
the
bottom
line
the
respondent
has
enforced
the
congressional
policy,
she
prevailed
here.
she
was
discriminated
against
and
one
of
the
things
that
congress
sought
to
eliminate
was
discrimination
based
on
race.
she
did
it
in
a
deferral
forum
under
the
statute,
she
did
not
get
all
of
the
complete
relief
to
which
she
was
entitled,
which
is
attorneys
fees,
among
other
things,
for
several
reasons,
and
in
effect
to
deny
her
the
leave
to
go
into
federal
court
would
penalize
her
for
having
enforced
the
policy.
it
would
result
in
the
inequitable
result
that
if
she
had
lost
in
the
state
division
of
human
rights
and
proceeded
ahead
into
federal
court
and
won
there,
she
could
have
gotten
more
relief
than
having
won
in
the
state
division
of
human
rights.
certainly
congress
didn't
envision
that.
in
point
of
fact,
it
authorized
and
permitted
the
award
of
fees
in
proceedings,
including
those
deferral
proceedings.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
the
new
york
state
division
of
human
rights
used
to
be
known
as
the
new
york
state
commission
on
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
yes.
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
yes.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
--
mr.
james
i.
meyerson
--
that
in
1965
and
'68,
the
new
york
state
law
was
amended
to
permit
attorneys,
private
attorneys
as
a
matter
of
right
to
appear
in
those
proceedings.
that
is,
after
the
'64
title
vii
enactment,
the
new
york
state
law
was
changed
to
permit
private
attorneys
to
appear
as
a
right.
prior
to
that
time,
they
had
to
seek
leave
by
intervention.
and
i
would
take
issue
with
the
license
perhaps
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners
in
categorizing,
as
the
dissent
did
and
as
the
district
court
did
below,
the
in
effect
uselessness
of
the
private
counsel
in
the
state
division
of
human
rights.
it
is
clear
that
the
private
counsel
plays
a
fundamental
and
pivotal
role
in
the
process.
in
light
of
the
import
that
the
united
states
has
seen
to
give
this
case,
i
have
elected
to
cede
the
remaining
ten
minutes
of
my
argument
to
the
assistant
solicitor
general,
and
so
i
would
defer
unless
there
are
inquiries.
