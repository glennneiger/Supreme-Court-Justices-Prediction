justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
suppose
they
were
a
codefendant
who
was
not
asked
to
cooperate?
is
he
to
be
treated
more
harshly
than
one
who
is
asked
to
cooperate
and
does
it
only
partially
or
less
harshly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
could
i
--
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
wonder
if
it
necessarily
(voice
overlap)
you
must
rest
entirely
on
the
fifth
amendment.
i
noticed
neither
the
questions
presented
are
framed
in
constitutional
terms.
and
i
suppose,
the
court
has
some
supervisory
power
over
the
factors
that
could
be
considered.
supposing
in
the
case
--
this
was
a
crime
of
using
a
telephone
to
facilitate
the
distribution
of
narcotics
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
supposing
the
government
intercepted
40
or
50
different
telephone
conversations
and
they
concluded
that
this
man
was
just
a
runner
of
some
kind,
who
would
normally
be
entitled
to
a
sentence
of
--
of
six
months
or
a
year,
or
some
-
some
first
offender
and
so
forth.
could
the
judge
say
to
him
at
sentencing,
"i
know
that
you
know
who
the
hire
ups
are
on
this
and
if
you
don't
tell,
the
prosecutor,
who
they
are,
i'm
going
to
give
you
30
years
because
there
are
30
different
instances
and
i
can
make
consecutive
sentences
out
of
it."
would
there
be
any
--
any
legal
objection
of
the
judge
doing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
eight
amendment,
i
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
sentencing
procedure
for
the
judge
to
say
--
to
get
in
--
get
involved
in
the
investigatory
process
in
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
let
me
just
think
through
again
the
fifth
amendment
point.
are
you
saying
that
--
you're
not
saying,
i
--
i
take
it
that
he
must
plead
the
fifth
amendment
when
he's
being
interviewed
by
the
prosecutor
before
the
sentencing
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
he
has
to
tell
the
judge
that
the
reason
he
previously
did
not
cooperate
was
because
of
a
fifth
amendment
concern.
