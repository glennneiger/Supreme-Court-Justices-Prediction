justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
varies
around
the
country.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
can
a
--
then,
can
a
federal
district
judge
in
this
district
give
consecutive
sentences
despite
what
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
to
stop
him
from
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point,
you
say
that
a
judge
can't
give
two
consecutive
sentences.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
suppose
a
man
is
caught
with
$18
billion
worth
of
dope,
hand
it
out
to
children
on
the
corner.
could
he
be
given
two
consecutive
sentences?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
made
them
--
if
he
made
them
with
children?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know,
but
it's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
200
involved
in
this
either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
clear
your
point,
before
you
get
there,
did
i
understand
that
if
he
had
said
before
the
sentence,
“that
the
reason
i
was
quiet
was
because
i
was
asserting
my
fifth
amendment
right,
that
the
judge
could
not
have
used
it
entirely.”
is
that's
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
what
you
said
that
under
those
circumstances,
he
would
not
have
done
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it's
your
position
that
he
could
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
judge
do
it
or
not,
if
he
raised
his
fifth
amendment
point
and
suppose
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
your
position
at
the
court
can
take
into
consideration,
these
arguments.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean
by
cooperate?
that
main
charge
with
crime
is
bound
without
more
to
come
in
and
say,
“one,
i
committed
the
crime.
and
two,
everybody
did
help
me,
and
three,
everybody
who
might
have
helped
me.”
how
far
does
he
have
to
cooperate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
this
careful
embezzlement
to
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
have
to
say
that
injecting
heroin
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
really
need
a
separate
law
for
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
anyone
who
charged
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
get
to
another
one.
if
a
witness
--
if
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
and
the
judge
called
him
to
the
witness
stand
and
he
says
“i'm
not
going
to
talk,”
does
he
have
to
say,
“i'm
not
going
to
talk,”
on
the
basis
of
my
constitutional
right
not
to
testify?
does
he
have
to
say
that
in
detail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
call
him,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
does
he
have
on
this
fifth
amendment,
after
saying,
“in
every
stage
of
the
proceeding,
there
are
no
exerting
efforts
on
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
a
minute
ago,
i
asked
you
about
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
--
when
was
he
obliged
to
say
“i
am
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
what
the
fifth
amendment
gives
him
the
right
to
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
talk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
does
it
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
but
that
means
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
to
talk,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
that
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
sense
in
here
and
he
stood
--
didn't
say
anything.
it
still
would
be
better
off,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
hence,
my
--
you
--
you'd
given
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
putting
him
on
the
duty
to
come
forth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
want
us
to
say
here
that
from
now
on,
every
defendant
who
is
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment
must
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
he
is
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment.
