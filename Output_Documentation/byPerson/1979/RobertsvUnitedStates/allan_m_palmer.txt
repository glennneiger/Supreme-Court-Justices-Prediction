mr.
allan
m.
palmer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
the
most
important
transcript
to
cite
from
the
sentencing
one
that
is
relevant
to
disposition
of
this
case
did
not
become
available
until
after
the
brief
and
the
appendix
of
--
of
petitioners
were
filed.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
sent
it
over
here
on
december
5th
and
the
briefs
were
filed
in
november
15th,
as
i
recall.
now,
the
transcript
we
refer
to
is
a
40-page-transcript
concerning
a
so-called
miranda
hearing
held
in
the
district
court.
and,
that
transcript
indicates
that
there
was
a
wiretap
in
the
district
and,
during
the
course
of
it,
someone
named
win
was
overheard.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
no,
it's
in
the
briefs,
your
honor,
because,
although
the
full
transcript
was
not
available,
we
in
fact
summarized
the
gist
of
it
from
other
source
material.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
when
it
was
heard
on
a
wiretap
and
then
a
green
jaguar,
he
was
alleged
to
have
delivered
$50
or
$100
worth
of
drugs
and
was
observed
at
the
situs
of
the
tap.
the
young
lady
who
owned
the
car
was
summoned
to
the
stands
subpoenaed
to
the
us
attorney's
office.
at
this
point,
there
were
no
indictments
or
criminal
charges
pending.
she
was
asked
“who
drives
the
car?”
she
said,
“the
only
other
person
that
drives
it
is
her
male
friend,
winfield
roberts
and
he's
right
outside
the
door.”
impressed
with
their
good
fortune,
the
district
attorney
and
the
police
officers
there
invited
him
in
to
discuss
the
matter.
and,
as
the
district
attorney
mr.
mcsorley
said,
as
soon
as
you
walked
in
the
door,
the
defendant
or
potential
defendant,
he
was
not
a
defendant
at
that
time,
was
read
his
miranda
rights
pursuant
to
the
pd
47
which
is
a
compilation
of
those
rights,
except
the
one
that
indicated
he
was
under
arrest
because,
clearly,
he
was
not.
he
was
advised
he
had
the
right
to
remain
silent
anything
he
said
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--
may
be
used
against
him.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
no,
sir.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
they
did
it
out
of
abundance
of
caution
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--
so
to
speak,
and
he
was
told
that
“if
you
want
to
answer
any
questions
now
with
a
lawyer
present,
you
have
the
right
to
stop
answering
in
any
time.
you
also
have
the
right
to
stop
answering
at
any
time
until
you
talk
to
a
lawyer.”
this
is
standard
pd
47
warning.
now,
as
the
district
attorney
testified
at
this
hearing
at
transcript
38,
he
said,
“the
petitioner
fully
understood
his
rights
and
the
trial
court
agreed.”
now,
initially,
the
petitioner
was
vague
about
any
involvement
in
the
case
until
an
actual
tape
of
his
voice
was
played
indicating
when
his
own
voice,
the
jaguar,
etcetera.
at
that
point,
he
admitted
what
was
on
the
tape
to
the
extent
of,
on
two
occasions,
he
delivered
drugs
with
$50
or
$100
to
this
charles
b.
thornton
in
a
jaguar.
at
that
point,
the
prosecutor
preston
said,
“well,
where
did
you
get
the
drugs
from?”
and,
as
the
testimony
indicated,
at
that
point,
police
officers
testified,
at
transcript
12,
the
petitioner
was
--
gave
an
evasive
answer,
“he
refused
to
tell
us.”
the
prosecutor
testified.
he
clamped
up
and
the
conversation
ended
because
he
wouldn't
go
any
further
than
that.
he
was
advised
to
come
back
in
two
or
three
days
and
think
it
over.”
he
did
so
and
he
said,
“i
can't
help
you
anymore,”
and
he
left.
now,
obviously,
the
defendant
who
was
not
advised
by
counsel
at
that
point,
he
was
not
under
duress,
only
admitted
that
which
the
government
knew.
when
he
heard
his
own
voice
on
the
tapes
to
deliveries,
he
said,
“yes,
i
was
involved
in
that.”
as
to
any
further
involvement,
any
conspiracies
of
the
persons
who
may
be
involved,
he
relied
and,
pursuant
to
his
warning
to
remain
silent.
and,
indeed,
this
is
the
very
consequence
envisioned
by
this
court
in
the
miranda
opinion
where
it
indicated
that
if
the
individual
indicates
in
any
manner
at
any
time
prior
to
or
during
questioning,
he
wants
to
rely
on
these
warnings,
rights.
at
this
point,
he
has
shown
that
he
intends
to
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
this
is
precisely
what
this
petitioner
did.
he
was
then
indictment,
arrested
and
indicted.
he
was
arrested
about
a
month
later,
indicated
about
two
months
after
that.
here,
again,
after
the
indictment
on
three
or
four
occasions,
now,
there's
a
transcript
--
the
remand
transcript
of
january
28,
1977
that
was
sent
to
this
court
also
in
december
5th,
alluded
to
in
the
government's
brief.
on
three
or
more
occasions,
personally,
the
prosecutor
spoke
to
his
attorney
for
cooperation.
he
wanted
his
cooperation
to
testify
in
open
court
against
the
codefendant
and
to
identify
the
other
people
he
was
involved
with,
the
places,
locations,
the
full
conspiracy,
so
to
speak.
and,
as
the
prosecutor
testified
at
the
remand
hearing,
“this
was
rejected
out
of
hand.
there
was
never
any
indication
that
mr.
roberts
would
assist
us
and,
indeed,
throughout
the
course
of
this
three-year-litigation."
mr.
roberts,
the
petitioner,
consistently
relied
on
his
right
to
remain
silent
until,
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
the
prosecutor
urged
this
noncooperation
as
a
basis
for
increasing
penalty
or,
as
a
sentencing
aggravating
factor
and
the
court
relying
thereon
and
enunciated
this
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
consecutive
sentence.
at
that
point,
mr.
roberts,
the
petitioner
was
penalized
for
relying
on
his
fifth
amendment
rights
which
the
government
concedes,
at
brief
37,
it
could
not
do.
the
court
that
is
could
not
so
penalize
him.
now,
the
government,
in
its
brief,
argues
a
waiver
theory
that
this
was
never
actually
urged
by
petitioner
during
the
course
of
the
three
years
or
the
sentencing
hearing.
he
says,
at
page
35
of
the
brief,
petitioner
as
counsel
never
said
that
non-cooperation
was
based
on
constitutional
rights
and
in
cri
--
and,
immunity
was
never
sought
by
petitioner
or
his
counsel.
and,
further,
goes
on
to
say
the,
point
two,
that,
at
no
time
during
the
sentencing
hearing
that,
in
fact,
counsel
elude
to
fifth
amendment
rights.
now,
these
are
important
considerations
and
we're
going
to
answer
them
fully,
as
we
have
in
the
brief,
we
believe.
insofar
as
the
three-year
phase
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
we
filed
a
memorandum.
we
don't
--
previously
had
a
--
we
filed
a
memorandum.
there
was
a
mandamus
petition
we
set
to
the
judge.
“we'd
ask
you
to
recuse
yourself
because,
under
the
greg
opinion
of
this
court,
you've
already
sentenced
the
man,
you've
heard
the
--
you've
read
the
presentence
report.
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
to
preserve
this
issue
of
fairness,
the
preservation,
the
appearance
of
fairness,
we
think
the
court
should
recuse
itself.”
and,
in
fact,
if
the
court
does
recuse
itself
in
the
--
well,
it
didn't
recuse
itself,
we
said.
but,
if
it
did
not
recuse
itself,
if
it
gave
concurring
sentences,
we
would
withdraw
that
claim,
that's
true.
in
a
footnote,
we
did
indicate
that
upon
consent
and
advice
of
the
defendant.
now,
in
many
cases,
petitioners
arrest
to
cooperate.
it
happens
all
the
time
in
district
courts,
and
it
is
understood
by
all
experienced
counsel,
defense
counsel,
that
if
the
man
says
no,
obviously
he's
relying
on
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
he
does
not
have
to
confess,
say
anything
to
the
government
at
all.
and,
indeed,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
brought
--
not
brought
into
court
during
the
three-year-period
and
said,
“well,
while
i
have
you
not
confessed
late
at
the
scheme
for
the
benefit
of
the
prosecutor?”
it
was
understood
by
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
that,
by
not
cooperating,
the
defendant
simply
relied
on
his
right
to
remain
silent
as
he
had
throughout
the
proceedings.
and
so,
when
the
government
says
that
the
defense
never
came
forward
during
these
three
years
and
said,
“well,
we're
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment
as
such”
or
that
“he
never
asked
for
cooperation,”
that
argument
is
long
--
the
brief
in
that
regard
is
long
in
argument
and
short
on
experience
because
it
is
generally
understood
that
there
is
no
right
for
the
government
to
compel
this
incriminating
statement
from
the
defendant.
and,
furthermore,
we're
not
familiar
with
any
instance
where
or
a
general
practice
whereas
the
defendant
who
says,
“i
would
like
immunity
prosecution.
please
give
us
immunity.”
the
government
knows
what
to
--
knows
what
to
do.
if
it
wants
to,
it
could
put
the
man
before
the
grand
jury,
if
he
claims
his
fifth
amendment
right,
then
give
him
immunity.
it's
not
up
to
the
defendant
to
ask
for
it.
it's
up
for
the
prosecution
to
confer
it
if
it
deems
fit.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
or
prior
thereto,
from
day
one,
june
13,
1975
when
the
defendant
walked
into
the
prosecutor's
office,
through
the
morning
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
not
one
time
in
writing
or
otherwise
did
the
government
ever
urge
noncooperation
as
a
sentencing
factor
for
aggravation
or
as
any
factor
at
all.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
of
course.
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
on
these
facts,
it
is
a
one-way
street
in
the
sense
that
the
man
is
consciously
giving
up
right
to
self-incrimination
if
he
cooperates.
in
narcotic
cases
especially,
there's
a
danger
to
one's
safety,
there's
a
danger
to
one's
life,
the
--
his
family,
and
he
consciously
gives
up
these
factors,
these
rights,
the
right
to
silence,
the
right
not
to
endanger
himself
or
his
family.
and,
for
that
reason,
when
a
man
cooperates,
he
does
so
voluntarily,
fine.
courts
have
indeed
given
benefit
to
that.
but
at
the
congress,
it's
not
true
because
if
he
doesn't
cooperate,
there
are
many
valid
reasons
such
as,
in
this
case,
his
reliance
on
the
right
of
self-incrimination.
well,
he
did
not
cooperation
--
did
not
cooperate
and,
in
fact,
judge
lombard,
in
considering
the
issue
in
the
ramos
and
digiovanni
case,
a
most
experienced
federal
appellate
judge,
has
indicated
that
it
is
a
one-way
street
in
that
regard.
that
is
quite
true,
your
honor.
now,
in
its
first
allocution,
prior
to
the
--
or
after
the
first
sentence,
the
government,
in
discussing
the
confession
statement
of
the
defendant,
they've
indicated
that
he
did
not
cooperate
with
the
government
in
a
historical
sense,
just
laying
out
the
facts.
it
did
in
no
way
suggested
or
intimated
that
that
was
the
reason
for
the
court
to
take
into
account
in
his
sentence
and,
in
fact,
it
was
not
urged
in
allocution
and
it
was
not
urged
by
the
court
in
sentencing.
now,
we
came
to
the
second
sentence
that
is
now
before
us.
here,
again,
the
government
wrote
a
written
allocution
and
never
once
did
it
ever
suggest,
intimate,
or
anything
else
say
that
lack
of
cooperation
is
a
sentencing
factor,
never
said
it.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
your
honor,
it's
interesting.
prior
to
1970
or
1971,
prosecutors
never
recommended
sentences.
it
is
only
a
recent
occurrence.
having
started
in
about
1970
or
1971,
this
report,
for
example,
i
was
there
prosecuting
cases
up
until
1968,
the
government
stood
mute
at
every
sentencing,
never
said
a
word.
it's
a
recent
innovation,
so
to
speak.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
yes,
i
remember
i
once
clerked,
when
i
was
a
student,
in
the
second
circuit,
a
long
time
ago,
many
years
ago
and
they
always
allocuted.
i
remember
the
prosecutors
allocuted
their
rights
since
time
and
memorial,
i
believe.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
don't
believe
so
because
it's
forcing
the
defendant
to
give
up
fifth
amendment
rights
which
is
still
in
here
after
the
plea,
as
in
this
case,
for
example.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
think
he
could
so
sentence
the
man
if
he
cooperates,
but
i
don't
think
the
judge
can
get
involved
in
that
decision
insofar
as
the
defendant
is
concerned.
i
think
when
the
judge
gets
involved
with
it,
he's
coercing
the
man
to
give
up
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
that's
where
the
danger
is.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
you
know,
that's
a
fact
of
life
in
the
trial
courts
all
the
time.
that's
true.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
think,
at
that
point,
he's
coercing
the
defendant
to
give
up
his
fifth
amendment
rights
which
he
can't
do,
and
i'm
going
to
get
into
that
a
little
further
in
the
even
broader
detail,
if
the
court
will.
now,
the
government
erroneously
suggests
the
reason
why
the
government
urged
this
lack
of
cooperation
in
its
brief.
it
indicates
at
page
814
and
841
of
its
brief
that,
well,
the
government
was
responding
to
petitioner
counsel's
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
courts
should
consider
his
cooperation
or
limited
statement
as
to
involvement
as
a
mitigating
factor,
and
the
government
responded
“tit-for-tat,”
so
to
speak.
at
brief
8
--
at
8
of
its
brief,
the
government
says,
“in
addition,
the
prosecutor
response
to
the
defense
counsel's
remarks
about
the
extent
of
petitioner's
cooperation
with
the
government."
we
never
alluded
to
his
cooperation
as
such
as
a
mitigating
factor.
what
we
did
do,
when
you
read
the
sentencing
transcript,
is
to
allude
to
the
facts
of
the
statement
he
gave
to
show
that
the
case
was
not
as
large
or
serious
as
urged
by
the
government
because,
insofar
as
the
facts
were
concerned
in
the
statement
the
defendant
gave,
he
said
that,
on
two
or
three
occasions,
he
delivered
drugs
worth
$50
or
$100
for
mr.
charles
thornton's
own
personal
use.
and,
indeed,
when
the
search
warrants
were
executed
to
six
of
them,
found
in
thornton's
house
was
bottle
top
cookers
and
syringes
in
dish
of
personal
use.
furthermore,
we
urge
that
thornton,
a
previously
convicted
narcotic
felon
who
pleaded
to
gambling
and
narcotic
law
violations
was
sentenced
to
probation
by
another
federal
judge
in
the
very
same
case
in
which
this
petitioner
was
charged.
so
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
no,
sir.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
whose
argument
does
your
honor
refer
to?
i
don't
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
it
was
not
a
very
big
--
insofar
as
this
petitioner
was
concerned,
as
we
saw
it.
notwithstanding
that
fact,
if
someone
gave
him
the
drugs,
who
was
a
person
in
the
more
a
distribution
type
of
role,
to
that
person,
whether
you
call
it
a
small
amount
distributed
or
not,
the
individuals
who
supplied
from
above
are
very
concerned
about
their
liability
and
the
danger
comes
from
them,
i
would
think,
as
the
case
has
indicate.
in
any
event
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
of
course
the
judge
could
take
that
into
account.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well
--
he
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--
took
into
account
several
factors,
your
honor.
now,
if
this
judge
never
talked
about
cooperation,
never
alluded
to
it,
possibly,
the
sentence
he
gave
might
have
been
a
viable
one.
the
fact
is,
theory
aside,
he
specifically
alluded
to
lack
of
cooperation
as
a
sentencing
factor,
and
i'm
going
to
now
refer
to
that
more
specifically.
now,
the
real
reason
the
government
alluded
to
noncooperation
was
this.
we
urged
in
writing
and
orally
that
when
you
have
pleas
or
verdicts
concerning
two
phone
counts,
two
so-called
phone
counts,
now
there
was
about
16
judges
in
the
district
court
here
active
and
seen
who
hear
criminal
cases.
no
judge
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
ever
given
consecutive
sentences
for
two
or
more
telephone
counts.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
the
grayson
case
itself
so
hold,
as
we
read
it.
in
grayson,
the
court
said
--
one
of
the
reasons
may
be
impermissible
that
i'm
going
to
sit
in
this
man
for
--
sentence
this
man
for,
this
page
--
438
u.s.
at
page
44,
and
the
court
said,
“mr.
grayson,
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
to
a
prison
term
because,
one,
to
deter
you
and,
two,
it
is
my
view
that
your
defense
was
a
fabrication
and
it
doesn't
have
the
slightest
merit
whatsoever.
and,
i
feel
it's
proper
for
me
to
mention
the
second
factor
because,
if
it's
an
improper
factor,
i
want
the
court
of
appeals
to
know
it
so
they
can
reverse
me.”
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
did
reverse
him,
then,
it
came
to
this
court
which
upheld
that
sentencing
factor.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
right.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
think
that
the
factor
was
an
improper
or
impermissible
one.
it
is
the
basis
upon
which
to
reverse
the
sentence.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
we
look
at
it
and,
if
it
strikes
us
in
the
realm
of
human
experience
as
an
improper
factor
that
he
shouldn't
consider,
i
think
the
reversal
is
required.
for
example,
more
--
if
he
had
said,
“well,
mr.
so
and
so,
you
are
a
particular
ethnic
group”
or
“you
are
a
particular
race”--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
it
would
indeed,
and
we
think,
in
this
sense,
the
use
of
the
improper
factor
has
always
been
understood
or
has
always
been
a
basis
upon
which
to,
at
least,
reverse
the
sentence
even
though
it
has
been
within
the
proper
guideline.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
in
this
case,
there
was
such
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
claim,
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
yes,
sir.
that
was
the
critical
or
most
important
factor
in
this
case,
the
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
right
to
remain
silent
which
was
penalized
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
that
is
true.
that
is
the
outstanding
reason.
now,
as
we
indicated,
no
federal
judge
before
in
this
jurisdiction
had
ever
given
consecutive
sentences
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i'm
not
sure.
we
--
it's
never
been
decided.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
there's
the
rule
of
lenity.
we
urge
that
you
have
a
wiretap
case.
the
lead
count
here
was
a
wiretap
and
several
overt
acts.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
on
these
facts,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
guess,
in
those
aggravating
circumstances,
it's
--
i'm
just
looking
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
where
there
was
a
conspiracy
and
four
overt
acts.
two
of
the
overt
acts
were
also
substantive
counts,
use
of
the
telephone.
our
point
was,
under
the
rule
of
lenity,
we
made
an
argument
that
the
main
count
is
the
lead
conspiracy
count.
if,
pursuant
to
that,
you
have
200
phone
calls,
does
that
mean
a
man
can
get
800
years
consecutively
for
use
of
the
phone
and
only
15
years
for
use
of
conspiracy?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
don't
know
about
children.
there
were
no
children
involved
in
this
case,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
hard
facts
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
hard
facts
make
different
circumstances,
i
would
submit.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
we
urged
it
in
our
statement
of
facts
prior
to
sentencing.the
district
attorney,
in
sentencing
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
it
was
based
on
(a)
my
experience
of
17
years
in
the
district
court,
having
conferred
with
drug
agents,
etcetera,
and
the
government
conceded
it
at
the
sentencing.
it
was
never
controverted
in
the
court
of
appeals
and,
indeed,
not
controverted
here.
in
fact,
the
prosecutor
said
that,
in
asking
for
consecutive
sentences
at
appendix
34
and
45,
we
realize
we're
going
against
custom
and
practice
in
this
courthouse
and
i'd
like
to
explain
why
we're
doing
so.
it's
not
to
appear
as
to
sigh
and
agree.
and
then,
he
launched
for
three
pages
the
argument
that
this
lack
of
cooperation
should
move
the
district
court
to
do
what
no
other
district
court
had
ever
done
before,
that
is,
impose
consecutive
sentences
for
two
telephone
counts.
now,
after
he
allocuted,
the
court
turned
to
us
and
said,
“do
you
want
to
make
a
response,
mr.
palmer?”
and,
remember,
at
this
point,
the
issue
had
not
been
joined.
of
course,
the
government
had
never,
until
that
moment,
urged
this
is
a
sentencing
factor.
and,
for
a
brief
paragraph,
we
de
--
when
you're
dealing
with
an
allocution,
you're
trying
to
persuade
somebody.
it's
not
a
legal
argument.
and,
we
said
to
the
court,
“well,
apparently
in
this
situation,
the
codefendant
thornton
got
probation."
this
defendant
is
before
the
court,
he
isn't
--
he
hasn't
cooperated.
the
defendant
--
the
government
is
obviously
mad
at
him.
let's
give
him
the
time
we
can,
as
much
as
we
can,
while
we've
got
him
before
us
and
then,
i
went
on
to
another
matter.
and,
in
these
circumstances,
we
don't
think
we
can
be
faulted
for
not
raising
the
issue
having
--
we
never
thought
about
the
issue,
the
implications
of
the
right
to
remain
silent,
the
miranda
warnings,
etcetera
when
courts
of
appeal
are
--
appeals
are
divided
on
the
issue.
in
fact,
that's
why
we're
here
today.
so,
we
can't
be
faulted
for
not
raising
at
that
time
and,
indeed,
the
issue
only
came
into
the
case
when
the
judge,
in
imposing
sentence,
said,
“that
is
one
of
the
factors
i'm
relying
upon.”
after
that,
the
case
went
on
appeal
and
we
researched
the
law,
presented
it
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
case
ultimately
wound
its
way
here.
now,
since
the
record
below
was
silent,
in
effect,
as
to
the
reasons
for
the
lack
of
cooperation,
other
than
this
fifth
amendment
issue
which
is
clearly
there,
it
was
impermissible
for
the
court
to
penalize
lack
of
cooperation
when
lack
of
cooperation
could
just
as
easily
have
been,
as
judge
lombard
said
in
his
opinions,
from
fear
of
harm,
danger
to
himself,
or
his
family,
or
other
like
reasons.
in
other
words,
there's
no
reason
to
say
that
failure
to
cooperate
on
these
facts
was
because
the
man
was
not
amenable
to
rehabilitation.
now,
there's
a
further
consideration
here,
and
that
is
the
fact
that,
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
urged
consecutive
penalties
because
petitioner
failed
to
cooperate
over
the
entire
course
of
the
case.
at
appendix
36,
he
said,
“throughout
the
long
process
that
has
occurred
some-june
of
1975,
when
he
first
came
into
my
office,
up
to
today,
he
still
has
refused
to
cooperate.”
now,
at
the
stage
where
the
defendant
was
in
the
prosecutor's
office
and
he
refused
to
cooperate,
the
defendant
was
then
penalized
in
part
because,
at
that
point,
unrepresented
by
counsel,
he
didn't
confess
everything
the
government
wanted
to
know,
indicate
where
he
got
the
drugs
from
and
things
of
that
nature,
and
we
think
that
is
clearly
impermissible.
secondly,
between
the
--
the
indictment
and
the
plea,
as
we
understand
it,
the
defendant
has
pleaded
not
guilty.
he
has
no
duty
to
confess,
cooperate
with
the
government.
he's
fifth
amendment
rights
have
not
been
waived
in
any
shape
or
form
and,
yet,
the
defendant
was
penalized
in
this
case,
during
this
phase
of
this
case
also,
because
he
never
came
and
said,
“prosecutor,
let
--
i
want
to
lay
my
soul
bare
to
you.”
i
think
that's
impermissible.
and,
in
line
with
the
question
that
justice
stevens
asked,
for
example,
under
grayson,
we
think
a
judge
could
probably
say
to
a
defendant
“mr.
defendant,
you're
going
to
testify.”
the
supreme
court
has
said,
“if
you
do
and
do
so
falsely,
and
you're
convicted,
i'm
going
to
take
that
into
account
when
i
impose
sentence.”
but,
we
don't
think
that,
prior
to
the
disposition
of
the
case,
the
defendant
can
be
brought
into
the
courtroom
and
the
judge
say
to
him,
“now,
mr.
defendant,
you
know,
i've
heard
you
haven't
cooperated
in
here.
the
government
wants
you
to
testify
against
your
codefendant.
you
haven't
done
that.
you
haven't
indicated
who
you
got
your
drugs
from,
and
i
think
that's
something
that
should
be
done
and,
if
you
don't
do
it,
when
--
if
you're
convicted
and
the
sentencing
comes
about,
i'm
going
to
penalize
you
for
that.”
i
think
that
is
totally
impermissible,
coercive,
collides
with
fundamental
rights
of
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case.
and,
for
these
reasons,
we
think
the
sentencing
in
this
case
on
these
facts
was
improper.
now,
i
have
five
minutes
to
go
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
those
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
just
briefly.
if
it
please
the
--
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
counsel's
waiver
argument,
there
is
no
relationship
to
the
facts
for
this
reason,
from
the
first
day
petitioner
walked
in
to
the
government's
office,
he
was
advised
of
his
miranda
rights
and
he
refused
to
testify
or
cooperate.
this
court
had
said
that
is
--
that
refusal
or
silence
is
an
indication
that
the
man
intends
to
rely
on
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
he
did
that
for
three
years
throughout
these
proceedings.
never
until
the
day
of
sentencing
did
the
government
ever
urged
lack
of
cooperation
as
a
sentencing
factor.
therefore,
there
was
no
reason
to
--
for
the
defense
or
petitioner
to
urge
it
because
the
government
had
never
alleged
it.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
(inaudible)
came
up
for
the
first
time
on
appeal,
after
the
judge
had
injected
it
into
the
case.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
the
statement
of
miranda?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
the
--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--
miranda
dealt
in
that
sense,
but
in
any
event,
regardless
of
whether
he's
under
arrest
or
not,
if
he's
warned
and
relies
on
that
warning
to
refrain
from
saying
anything,
whether
you
say
he's
in
custody
or
not,
it
was
all
just
the
same,
as
we
see
it.
thank
you.
