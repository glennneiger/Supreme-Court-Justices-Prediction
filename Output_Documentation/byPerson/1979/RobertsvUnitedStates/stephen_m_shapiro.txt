mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
after
listening
to
extensive
allocutions
from
defense
counsel
and
the
prosecutor,
judge
pratt
imposed
sentence
on
petitioner,
explaining
that
he
had
considered
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
a
dealer
in
heroin,
that
petitioner
was
on
parole
from
a
prior
bank
robbery
conviction
and
that
petitioner
had
refused
to
cooperate
with
the
government
in
identifying
the
persons
who
supplied
them
of
heroin.
we
contend
that
judge
pratt's
consideration
of
petitioner's
refusal
to
cooperate,
along
with
his
prior
record
and
the
severity
of
his
offense,
was
entirely
proper
and
was
consistent
with
congress'
directive
that
no
limitation
shall
be
placed
on
the
information
concerning
the
character
and
the
conduct
of
a
person
convicted
of
an
offense,
which
maybe
considered
in
imposing
sentence.
petitioner's
contrary
view
is
based
on
the
argument
that
his
refusal
to
cooperate
was
an
exercise
of
fifth
amendment
rights
and
that
judge
pratt
punished
him
for
exercising
those
rights.
the
short
answer
to
that
contention
is
that
petitioner
never
claimed
or
asserted
any
fifth
amendment
right
which
he
may
have
had.
throughout
the
three-year
period
that
preceded
his
sentence,
petitioner
never
suggested
that
his
refusal
to
cooperate
rested
on
fifth
amendment
grounds.
in
addition,
his
conduct
gave
no
indication
that
he
was
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment.
when
he
was
first
interviewed
in
1975,
he
immediately
confessed.
he
later
pleaded
guilty,
first,
of
the
charge
of
conspiracy
and
later,
to
two
of
the
substantive
counts
in
the
indictment.
most
importantly,
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
defense
counsel
fully
disclosed
petitioner's
refusal
to
cooperate
and
did
not
even
hint
that
the
extent
of
this
cooperation
should
not
be
considered
or
that
this
subject
was
immune
from
consideration
under
the
fifth
amendment.
far
from
invoking
the
fifth
amendment,
counsel
stated
to
the
court
that
petitioner
refused
to
cooperate
because
he
wasn't
that
involved
in
the
conspiracy.
counsel
argued
yesterday
that
everyone
must
have
known
that
petitioner
was
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment.
with
deference,
the
district
court
would
have
needed
powers
of
clairvoyance
to
recognize
that
there
was
a
fifth
amendment
claim
in
this
case.
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
raised
as
a
justification
for
petitioner's
refusal
to
cooperate
until
he
filed
his
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
self-executing
and
may
not
be
relied
on
unless
it's
invoked
in
timely
fashion.
petitioner's
argument,
that
the
fifth
amendment
protects
his
silence
without
any
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
district
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
believe
that
that
would
present
a
far
different
question
and
it
would
raise
a
serious
constitutional
difficulty
if
petitioner
had
invoked
and
relied
on
the
fifth
amendment.
that
issue
can
be
argued
two
different
ways,
but
we
submit
that
the
court
need
not
to
grapple
with
that
difficulty
in
this
case,
where
the
fifth
amendment
was
never
exercised.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
would
simply,
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
that
the
vermeulen
case,
he
would
simply
advise
the
sentencing
court
that
he
was
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
cooperating
and
that
this
was
an
impermissible
factor
in
sentencing.
and
had
he
done
so,
i
had
every
confidence
that
the
district
court
would
have
taken
that
factor
out
of
its
consideration.
it's
a
simple
matter
as
judge
moore
pointed
out
in
the
vermeulen
case
to
apprise
the
court
of
one's
reliance
on
the
constitution
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
a
great
deal
of
debate
was
focused
on
the
question
of
cooperation
and
it
would
have
been
very
simple
for
counsel
to
advise
the
court
that
this
was
an
improper
consideration
and
that
the
fifth
--
fifth
amendment
privileged
his
refusal
to
cooperate.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
didn't
take
place
here.
and
your
honor
is
quite
correct
in
pointing
out
that
if
the
district
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
realistic
exposure
to
incrimination
from
this
answer
and
that
petitioner
was
simply
covering
up
for
other
person
which
was
our
inference
all
along,
that
then
it
would
be
an
invalid
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
the
rogers
case
and
another
case
that
we
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
had
he
brought
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
it
would've
greatly
altered
the
complexion
of
this
case.
but
as
this
court
has
held,
it's
not
sufficient
merely
to
refuse
to
answer
a
question
or
to
fail
to
provide
information.
that's
not
an
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
had
he
entertained
the
subjective
beliefs,
he
should've
advised
the
court.
the
court
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
he
was
fearful
of
self-incrimination
under
these
circumstances.
there
was
no
indication
of
this
at
all
from
counsel.
and
he
had
three
years
to
--
to
develop
this
theory,
if
we
wish
--
wished
to
advance
it.
we
notified
him
from
the
outset
that
the
extent
of
this
cooperation
would
affect
the
charges
against
him.
the
amount
of
time
he
spent
in
prison
and
would
be
made
known
to
the
court.
and
yet
he
never
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
until
this
theory
occurred
to
him
in
the
court
of
appeals,
when
he
put
this
argument
into
his
appellate
brief.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
court
held
that
it
is
not
in
the
piemonte
case.
in
piemonte,
the
court
concluded
that
fear
of
retaliation
and
of
--
and
one's
physical
safety.
it's
not
the
same
as
a
fear
of
self-incrimination
and
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
government
to
protect
persons
against
retaliation.
and
we
do
indeed
have
a
system
for
doing
that,
the
witness
protection
program.
if
this
had
been
explained
to
the
government
or
to
the
court,
steps
could
have
been
taken
to
protect
petitioner
if
that
was
his
concern.
but
no
one
was
ever
advised
of
this
factor
as
being
a
concern
on
his
part.
other
coconspirators
in
this
conspiracy
did
assist
the
government
and
did
testify
against
persons
who
were
higher
up
in
the
chain
of
the
conspiracy.
and
there
was
no
retaliation.
if
petitioner
had
been
fearful
of
this,
he
should've
apprised
the
court
and
the
prosecutor,
but
this
was
never
raised.
as
--
as
this
court
pointed
out
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
would
think
that
--
that
a
person
who
was
not
been
asked
to
cooperate
could
not
be
faulted
for
failing
to
come
forth
with
information
and
that
would
not
be
an
adverse
circumstance
to
take
account
in
sentencing
where
somebody
who
provides
some
information,
but
still
mulls
the
government
as
to
the
rest
of
it,
would
be
turning
his
back
on
the
request
and
that
would
reflect
on
this
character
and
his
attitude
towards
society.
in
the
first
instance
that
your
honors
post,
where
there
has
not
been
a
request,
i
think
it's
difficult
to
fault
that
individual
for
not
coming
forward
with
the
information.
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
vajtauer
case
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
our
position
is
that
that
would
present
a
very
serious
difficulty.
i'm
reluctant
to
say
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
--
he
may
well
have
--
have
not
considered
that,
but
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
my
position
that
--
that
that's
a
difficult
question
under
the
corbitt
case
that
was
recently
handed
down.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
submit
there's
--
there's
a
strong
argument
that
he
could've
done
it,
although
that
question
isn't
--
hasn't
been
decided
by
this
court
of
course
and
there
are
alternative
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
after
he's
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment,
if
the
court
views
that
as
a
refusal
to
cooperate,
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
standing
on
one's
right
to
go
to
trial
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
his
--
this
is
a
reflection
of
you
on
his
attitude
towards
society.
if
he's
unwilling
to
identify
the
persons
who
continue
to
inject
heroin
into
the
community
and
continue
to
cause
this
injury
to
the
community
even
though
he
has
that
information,
we
submit
that
that
is
an
adverse
reflection
on
his
character.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
because
it
--
it
reflects
on
the
man's
character.
his
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
don't
need
a
separate
law
for
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
as
the
court
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
he
would.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
quite
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
quite
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
if
--
if
he's
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
but
this
court
is
pulled
in
an
analogous
situation
in
the
corbitt
case
that
taking
into
account
someone's
unwillingness
to
waive
their
fifth
amendment
rights
and
go
to
trial
is
something
can
be
taken
into
account
in
sentencing.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
the
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
my
--
my
understanding
is
--
is
that
under
corbitt,
it's
permissible
to
impose
differential
sentences
when
one
does
insist
on
a
--
a
right
to
go
to
trial
and
to
grant
lenience
to
those
who
do
not
insist
on
that
right.
and
in
your
--
your
honor's
hypothetical,
if
the
individual
refuses
to
cooperate
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment,
i
would
think
that
would
be
analogous
to
the
person
who
says
"i'm
not
going
to
plead
guilty.
i'm
going
to
stand
trial."
where
the
court
has
--
has
agreed
that
differential
sentencing
is
--
is
proper,
but
i
--
i
would
reemphasize
that
that
is
not
the
issue
here,
because
there's
been
no
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
this
is
an
interesting
and
difficult
issue,
but
it
simply
is
not
posed
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
--
would
it
be
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
there
is
no
complete
testimony.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
it
would
arguably
be
a
penalty
imposed
on
him
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--
for
--
for
not
cooperating.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
just
be
an
additional
sentence
attached
to
is
lack
of
cooperation,
but
that
--
that
arguably
is
what
was
approved
in
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
--
i
would
agree
that
--
that
i
--
i
think
we
could
--
we
might
be
able
to
win
this
case
even
if
the
fifth
amendment
was
pleaded
under
the
corbitt
precedent.
but
here
it's
on
our
fortiori
case,
because
the
fifth
amendment
was
never
raised.
and
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
before
the
fifth
amendment
can
be
relied
on
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
has
to
be
asserted
in
the
--
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
certainly,
there
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
no
such
right
and
in
fact
there
is
a
federal
criminal
statute,
18
u.s.c.
4
that
provides
that
it's
compounding
of
a
felony
or
misprision
of
a
felony
to
fail
to
report
and
to
conceal
the
occurrence
of
crimes
by
other
persons.
and
this
conduct
of
petitioners
threads
very
close
to
that,
without
an
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
simply
withholding
the
information
that
was
in
his
possession.
that's
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
was
not
charged
with
that,
but
we
say
it
--
it
reflects
on
his
character
and
it
reflects
on
his
attitude
towards
society.
just
the
way
the
perjury
in
the
grayson
case
reflected
on
the
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
--
he
doesn't
have
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
doesn't'
have
to
use
his
lawyer's
language.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
doesn't
have
to
use
lawyer's
language.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
as
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
in
the
rogers
case
and
the
vajtauer
case
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
he
was
obliged
to
say,
"i
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment,”
or
“i'm
relying
on
my
right
to
refuse
to
incriminate
myself."
he
has
to
fairly
apprise
the
tribunal
of
his
reliance
on
that
constitutional
privilege.
he
doesn't
have
to
use
a
particular
kind
of
lawyer's
language,
but
it
isn't
enough
just
to
say,
"i'm
not
talking."
the
court
has
held
that
repeatedly.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
not
self-executing.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
not
self-executing.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
--
it
says
that
no
person
maybe
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
--
but
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
there
must
be
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
--
if
he
didn't
invoke
his
noncooperation
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--
would
be
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
invoke
the
constitutional
privilege.
and
this
court
has
held
that
that's
the
requirement
of
the
law
consistently
over
the
years.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
precisely.
he
--
he
would
be
--
he
would
be
leading
the
court
into
error,
if
the
rule
were
anything
else,
because
he
brought
the
court's
attention
to
his
cooperation
and
gave
a
totally
different
explanation
for
his
refusal.
he
said
he
was
not
that
involved
in
the
conspiracy.
he
asked
the
court
to
consider
it.
and
if
--
if
he
didn't
then
and
there
asserted,
this
shouldn't
be
a
permissible
factor,
he
was
simply
leading
the
court
into
--
into
error.
and
the
reason
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals,
to
us
is
just
a
--
a
ploy.
it
--
it's
leading
the
court
into
error
and
then
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
--
the
outer
limit
is
prescribed
by
the
eighth
amendment,
and
i
submit
that
--
that
in
your
honor's
hypothetical
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
eight
amendment
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
we
submit
that
it
is.
if
it's
within
the
statutory
limits
--
congress
has
--
has
prescribed
expressly
that
all
information
bearing
on
the
conduct
and
the
character
of
the
individual
can
be
considered.
and
if
there's
no
statutory
objection
under
the
relevant
penal
statute,
no
eighth
amendment
barrier
to
piling
on
the
punishments,
then
this
is
a
proper
procedure.
but
i
--
i
would
point
that
there
is
no
element
in
this
case
of
--
of
threatening
the
defendant
and
negotiating
with
the
defendant
by
the
court.
the
seventh
circuit
has
approved
a
--
a
course
of
behavior
similar
to
what
your
honor
described.
that
was
a
rule
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
we've
cited
the
seventh
circuit's
decisions
in
our
brief.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
up
to
congress
and
the
judge.
that's
quite
correct.
and
if
petitioner
had
within
his
--
within
his
own
mind,
any
mitigating
information
that
he
wanted
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
judge,
he
was
permitted
to
do
that
under
the
rules.
and
he
made
an
extensive
allocution.
and
if
any
of
these
concerns
that
he's
raising
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
were
concerns
that
troubled
him.
any
fear
about
self-incrimination
or
fear
about
retaliation,
he
should
have
presented
them
then
and
there.
that's
the
only
way
the
district
court
could
have
known
these
concerns.

1970.
that
is
part
of
the
comprehensive
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
was
merely
a
codification
of
the
rule
in
williams.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
--
that
congress
meant
to
adopt
the
standard
that
this
court
had
prescribed
in
several
of
its
prior
cases
including
williams.
laying
aside,
petitioner's
afterthought
arguments,
it's
possible
to
see
this
case
as
it
was
presented
to
judge
pratt.
petitioner
stood
before
the
court
as
a
convicted
heroin
dealer.
he
had
distributed
heroin
and
then
previously
been
convicted
for
bank
robbery.
he'd
also
been
convicted
for
unauthorized
use
of
a
motor
vehicle
as
well
as
larceny.
he
was
on
parole
for
his
prior
bank
robbery
convictions,
when
he
was
arrested
once
again
for
dealing
with
heroin.
in
addition,
he
stood
before
the
court
as
a
man
who
refused
to
cooperate.
although
petitioner
in
amici
argued
that
this
had
no
logical
relationship
to
the
length
of
sentence
to
be
imposed,
we
submit
that
it
was
a
highly
relevant
datum.
along
with
the
other
information
available
to
judge
pratt,
it
showed
what
kind
of
a
man
petitioner
was.
it
was
part
of
the
mosaic
of
information
that
revealed
his
character
and
his
attitude
towards
society.
it
showed
who
he
wanted
to
protect
and
who
was
unwilling
to
protect.
it
showed
that
he
still
adhere
to
the
code
of
conduct
of
the
criminal
conspiracy.
not
the
code
of
conduct
that
society
recognizes.
the
prosecutor's
repeated
request
to
cooperate
presented
a
chance
for
petitioner
to
turnover
a
new
leaf.
it's
beyond
dispute
that
heroine
causes
addiction
of
members
of
the
community,
which
not
only
ruins
many
lives
and
causes
large
numbers
of
crimes
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--
but
it
actually
results
in
deaths
of
persons
who
overdose
on
heroin.
last
year
in
the
district
of
columbia,
41
persons
died
from
heroin
overdoses.
in
short,
dealing
in
heroin
is
a
highly
antisocial
act.
the
prosecutor
gave
petitioner
a
chance
to
mitigate
the
harm
which
he
had
done,
by
stopping
the
other
persons
who
continued
to
inject
heroin
into
the
community.
it
was
an
opportunity
to
break
off
his
prior
pattern
of
behavior,
an
opportunity
that
he
rejected.
petitioner's
refusal
to
help
make
immense
for
the
harm
which
he
had
done,
was
one
of
many
invocations
that
he
was
a
full
prospect
for
rehabilitation.
as
professor
heart
has
correctly
pointed
out,
rehabilitation
requires
recognition
of
the
community's
interests
and
the
obligations
of
community
life.
refusal
to
cooperate
also
suggested
that
the
substantial
period
of
imprisonment
was
needed
to
protect
the
community.
by
refusing
to
cooperate,
petitioner
shows
with
his
allegiance
with
his
coconspirators
was
unbroken,
an
association
that
could
be
easily
resumed
on
his
release
from
prison.
although
petitioner
at
amici
argued
that
noncooperation
should
not
be
considered,
we
submit
that
this
--
the
statute
that
the
chief
justice
referred
to,
is
direct
evidence
to
the
contrary.
it
says
that
there
should
be
no
limits
on
the
information
concerning
the
character
and
conduct
of
the
person
convicted
of
an
offense,
which
may
be
considered
in
imposing
sentence.
this
court
has
approved
that
principle
repeatedly
in
its
own
decisions.
most
recently
in
the
grayson
case,
this
court
emphasized
that
the
sentencing
judge
should
consider
the
whole
range
of
information,
bearing
on
a
convicted
defendant's
character
and
his
attitude
towards
society.
failure
to
cooperate
with
the
authorities
in
stopping
persons
who
continue
to
distribute
heroin
with
in
the
community,
is
certainly
relevant
to
the
appraisal
of
the
defendant's
character
and
his
attitude
towards
society.
we
note
that
at
common
law
there
was
a
duty
to
raise
the
“hue
and
cry”
to
alert
the
police
to
the
occurrence
of
crimes
by
other
persons,
so
those
crimes
could
be
stopped.
and
under
the
modern
penal
code,
it's
a
compounding,
or
misprision
of
felony
not
to
report
felonies
and
to
conceal
felonies
by
other
persons.
petitioner's
unwillingness
to
realign
his
interests
with
those
of
society
and
his
determination
to
conceal
the
actions
of
those
persons
who
prey
on
society,
was
a
factor
that
the
sentencing
court
could
not
properly
ignore
in
making
a
responsible
evaluation
of
his
attitude
and
his
character.
petitioner
and
amici
have
advanced
the
rather
surprising
argument
that
the
extent
of
a
defendant's
cooperation
is
relevant
in
granting
leniency,
but
is
not
relevant
in
enhancing
punishment.
we
say
that
this
is
surprising
because
it
presupposes
two
levels
of
punishment,
based
on
the
convicted
defendant's
willingness
to
cooperate
and
do
name
his
accomplices.
this
theory
would
open
the
door
to
precisely
the
result
that
petitioner
opposes.
within
statutory
limits,
consecutive
sentences
could
be
imposed
on
those
persons
who
do
not
cooperate
and
concurrent
sentences
could
be
reserved
for
those
who
do
and
show
their
entitlement
to
leniency.
this
procedure,
like
the
procedure
that
the
petitioner
opposes,
would
play
substantial
pressure
on
convicted
defendants
to
name
their
accomplices
to
avoid
additional
prison
time.
we
contend
that
there
is
no
logical
reason
why
defendant's
refusal
to
cooperate
should
not
be
relevant
in
imposing
sentence,
whether
the
decision
is
characterized
as
increasing
punishment
or
withholding
lenience.
if
the
sentence
is
within
statutory
limits,
if
the
defendant
has
had
the
opportunity
to
cooperate
and
if
he's
had
the
opportunity
to
plead
any
applicable
constitutional
privilege
or
present
any
mitigating
information
that
he
may
possess
to
the
district
court.
and
if
he
doesn't
take
any
of
these
actions,
his
uncooperative
conduct
is
properly
judged
at
face
value.
along
with
the
other
information
available
with
the
judge,
it
sheds
light
on
the
question
whether
the
defendant
is
willing
to
recognize
the
obligations
of
community
life
and
whether
he
continues
to
pose
a
threat
to
the
community.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
not
at
all.
we
--
we
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
our
--
our
point
is
that
--
that
when
the
judge
is
considering
these
factors
and
petitioner's
counsel
is
adverting
to
them
before
the
court,
he
has
a
duty
to
at
least
advise
the
court
that
this
is
an
impermissible
factor,
because
of
the
fifth
amendment.
a
counsel
is
there
for
that
very
purpose
to
raise
a
constitutional
or
any
other
legal
objections
to
these
considerations.
as
the
court
reaffirmed
in
the
case
of
dorszynski
versus
united
states
and
i
quote,
"if
there
is
one
rule
in
the
federal
criminal
practice
which
is
firmly
established,
it
is
that
the
appellate
court
has
no
control
over
a
sentence
which
is
within
the
limits
allowed
by
statute."
this
court
has
applied
that
rule
in
narcotics
cases
where
substantial
consecutive
sentences
were
imposed
by
the
court.
the
gore
case
and
the
blockburger
cases
are
examples.
the
sentence
imposed
by
judge
pratt,
fell
squarely
within
the
limits
prescribed
by
congress.
limits
that
congress
contemplated
would
provide
maximum
flexibility
to
the
judge
permitting
him
to
tailor
the
period
of
imprisonment,
as
well
as
the
fine
under
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
from
a
common
sense
point
of
view,
the
sentence
imposed
within
these
limits
was
not
a
severe
or
disproportionate
one.
judge
pratt
required
petitioner
to
serve
only
two
years,
before
becoming
eligible
for
parole
and
he
declined
to
impose
any
fine
of
any
kind.
for
convicted
heroin
dealer,
who
was
already
on
parole
for
a
prior
conviction
for
bank
robbery,
this
we
submit
was
a
very
lenient
sentence.
in
our
view,
there
is
nothing
here
that
would
tempt
an
appellate
tribunal
to
disturb
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
district
court.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
