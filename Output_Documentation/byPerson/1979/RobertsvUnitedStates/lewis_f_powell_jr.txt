justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
a
criminal
case.
it
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
question
is
whether
the
defendant's
failure
to
cooperate
with
law
enforcement
authorities
was
a
proper
factor
for
consideration
in
determining
his
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was.
the
petitioner
confessed
involvement
in
a
heroin
conspiracy,
but
he
refused
to
identify
the
others
who
had
participated
in
the
crime.
the
district
court
imposed
a
heavy
sentence.
it
explained
that
petitioner
was
a
dealer
that
he
was
given
the
opportunity
but
failed
to
cooperate
with
the
government.
petitioner's
unwillingness
to
assist
law
enforcement
suggested
the
possibility
of
an
intention
to
return
to
dealing
in
narcotics.
it
also
suggested
that
petitioner
would
not
respond
affirmatively
to
rehabilitation.
petitioner
offered
no
explanation
for
his
declining
to
cooperate
nor
did
petitioner
claim
that
his
silence
was
an
exercise
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
as
he
failed
to
invoke
the
privilege
at
a
time
when
its
legitimacy
could
be
determined,
he
waived
his
right
to
claim
it
on
appeal.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
