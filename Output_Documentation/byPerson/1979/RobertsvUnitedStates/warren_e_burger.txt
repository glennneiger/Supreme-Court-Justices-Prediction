e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
roberts
against
the
united
states.
mr.
palmer,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
make
any
point
of
impropriety
and
giving
the
miranda
warning
too
soon
rather
than
too
late?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
cooperation
could
be
used
and
is
it
sometimes
argued
as
a
reason
for
moderating
a
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
it's
just
a
one-way
street
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
the
--
are
the
prosecutors
supposed
to
--
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
do
the
prosecutors
get
into
the
act
with
recommendations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
wasn't
a
very
big
deal
as
you
were
suggesting
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
undercut
your
argument
or
his
argument,
i
should
say,
that
he
was
liable
to
be
murdered
and
liquidated
if
he
cooperated
with
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you've
just
been
--
i
thought
you
were
telling
us
that
this
wasn't
a
very
big
narcotics
operation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
judge,
in
those
circumstances,
is
not
entitled
to
take
into
account
that
with
the
damage
that
the
use
of
drugs
does
to
a
great
many
people
that
peddlers
--
drug
peddlers
should
be
put
away
for
quite
a
while?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
that's
what
he
did
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
sure
complained
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
palmer,
where
do
we
get
the
--
where
do
we
find
this
data
that
you
mentioned
on
judges
never
giving
consecutive
sentences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
thinking
about
documenting
it.
where
is
that
report?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
i
think
we
want
to
ask
you
to
take
two
minutes
today
and
the
rest
tomorrow.
we'll
resume
at
10
o'clock
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
arguments
in
roberts
against
the
united
states.
mr.
shapiro,
you
may
proceed
whenever
youâ€˜re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
position
here
be
different
if
he
had
in
his
allocution,
asserted
a
fifth
amendment
right
and
not
to
reveal
the
sources
of
his
drug
supply?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
would
--
just
--
just
--
how
would
you
go
about
asserting
of
the
fifth
amendment?
would
it
be
an
assertion
that
would
be
retroactive
to
the
time
when
he
failed
to
cooperate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
took
--
took
it
from
mr.
palmer's
argument
yesterday
that
his
chief
reliance
on
this
claim
was
because
of
--
of
a
fear
of
some
possible
consequences
of
disclosing
who
his
principal
sources
of
heroin
were.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
a
witness
is
called
in
any
ordinary
criminal
case
and
he
declines
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
if
he
gives
information,
he
--
he
might
be
placing
himself
in
jeopardy
of
retaliation
by
the
defendants
or
friends
of
the
defendants.
is
--
is
that
--
is
that
a
sort
of
de
facto
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
constitutional
right
to
maintain
silence
about
criminal
activity
that
--
that
is
known
to
the
person
questioned.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
unless,
it
will
--
being
compelled
incrimination
of
himself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
truly
in
your
argument,
mr.
shapiro,
you
referred
to
the
statute
which
defined
broad
powers
in
the
sentencing
judge
to
take
into
account,
everything.
what's
the
date
of
that
statute,
when
was
that
enacted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
comprehensive
--
the
omnibus
--
now,
did
that
add
anything
to
what
this
court
said
in
williams
against
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
palmer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
statement
you
referred
to
was
made
in
the
context
of
the
person
being
interrogated
after
arrest
and
while
in
custody,
was
it
not?
is
it
that
--
that
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
interrogation
must
stop
as
soon
as
he
indicates
that
he
doesn't
want
to
talk.
is
that
the
context
of
that
statement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
you
just
--
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
roberts
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
