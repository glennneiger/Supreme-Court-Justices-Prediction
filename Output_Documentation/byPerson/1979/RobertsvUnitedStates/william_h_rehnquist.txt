justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
isn't
true
--
true
mr.
palmer,
that
there
was
a
colloquy
at
least
before
the
trial
where
you
--
where,
in
defense
counsel,
agreed
to
withdraw
their
motion
to
recues
judge
pratt
if
he
would
agree
to
concur
in
sentences.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
palmer,
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
if
the
judge
had
not
alluded
to
the
absence
of
cooperation,
the
sentence
he
gave
might
have
been
a
viable
one,
was
the
one
word
you
used.
and
then,
you
mentioned
sentencing
factors.
is
there
some
case
from
this
court
that
holds
absent
if,
constitutional
or
statutory
violation,
a
sentence
is
to
be
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court
on
the
basis
of
the
sentencing
factors
the
judge
took
into
consideration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
was
the
district
court's
view
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
that
sentencing
factors
could
be
taken
into
consideration
even
though
the
sentence
imposed
was
limit
--
in
the
limits
proscribed
by
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
whether
it's
improper
or
impermissible?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
be
a
constitutional
claim,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
define
improper
factor
as
being
a
violation
of
some
constitutional
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
--
and
so,
that's
what
you
mean
when
you
say
improper
factor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
not
entitled
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment,
unless
there's
a
real
and
substantial
probability
that
the
answer
to
the
question
will
in
fact
incriminate
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that,
i
mean
just
a
talismanic
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
necessarily
solve
the
problem
even
though
you
say
that
in
--
apparently,
it's
conceded,
that
didn't
take
place
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
this
--
the
--
it
isn't
up
to
the
government
in
the
sense
that
the
government
is
the
prosecutor
to
prescribe
the
sentence
for
a
convicted
defendant.
they
said,
it's
up
to
the
judge.
