mr.
palmer,
do
you
think
it
would
be
permissible
for
a
district
judge
to
have
a
policy
that
when
he
takes
a
plea,
that
he
tells
the
defendant
that
he,
he
--
in
his
own
sentencing
practice,
if
the
defendant
cooperates,
he'll
probably
get
one
year.
if
he
does
not
cooperate,
he'll
probably
get
two
years,
assuming
it
fits
the
normal
pattern
of
a
certain
kind
of
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
you
did
acknowledge,
if
i
understood
your
response
to
the
chief
justice,
that
the
judge
could
have
such
a
policy
that
if
the
man
cooperates,
he'll
only
sentence
him
a
year
instead
of
an
otherwise
appropriate
sentence
of
two.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
supposing
he
had
10
--
10
very
similar
cases.
in
the
first
one,
the
man
cooperates
and
he
says,
“i'm
only
giving
you
one
year
because
you
cooperated.”
the
next
man,
he
gives
him
two
years.
he
didn't
cooperate
and
he
says
nothing
about
it,
but
he
established
the
pattern
by
what
he
actually
did.
so,
the
lawyer
now
knows
by
--
based
on
a
series
of
cases
that
if
his
client
cooperates,
he'll
get
one
year
and
if
he
doesn't
cooperate,
he'll
probably
get
two.
can
the
l
--
i
take
it,
the
lawyer
could
tell
the
defendant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
a
fact
of
life
that
the
judge
cannot
tell
the
defendant.
