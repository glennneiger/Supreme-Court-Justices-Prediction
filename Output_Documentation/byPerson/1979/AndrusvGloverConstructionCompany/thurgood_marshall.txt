there
is
nothing
to
stop
you
from
putting
that
in
evidence,
was
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn't
you
put
it
into
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
think
of
it?
i'm
not
saying
--
i
am
just
trying
to
help
--
but
we
can't
take
your
'think,'
can
we,
that
you
think
that
is
what
they
were
doing?
that
is
not
enough,
is
it?
don't
we
have
to
know
one
way
or
the
other
in
order
to
go
along
with
your
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
point
is
that
there
was
competitive
bidding
up
until
'71.
justice
thurgood
marshall
unless
you
can
prove
that,
how
can
we
assume
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
would
not
like
to
participate
in
an
opinion
which
says
that
prior
to
1961
the
government
awarded
its
contracts
on
competitive
bidding
insofar
as
roads
are
concerned
--
footnote,
your
thinking.
i
have
to
have
something
better
than
that,
than
your
footnote.
