mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
focal
point
of
this
case
is
the
so-called
buy
indian
act.
the
act
itself
is
quite
brief.
it
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
insofar
as
may
be
practicable
to
employ
indian
labor
and
to
make
purchases
of
indian
industry
in
the
open
market.
the
secretary
has
delegated
his
authority
under
the
act
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
the
bureau
in
turn
has
promulgated
a
detailed
policy
statement
concerning
buy
indian
contracting.
the
buy
indian
program
is
fairly
narrow
in
scope.
it
pertains
only
to
bia
procurement
and
that
by
definition
pertains
to
the
welfare
of
indians,
indian
tribes
and
indian
lands.
the
policy
statement
directs
the
local
bia
contracting
officer
where
practicable
to
first
ascertain
that
there
is
a
qualified
100
percent
indian
owned
contractor
capable
of
filling
the
contracting
need.
if
there
is
more
than
one
such
firm
in
the
normal
competitive
area,
whatever
the
contracting
need
is,
then
the
bia
officer
is
directed
to
arrange
competitive
bidding
among
the
various
indian
firms.
if
there
is
only
one
such
qualified
firm,
then
the
bia
officer
is
authorized
to
negotiate
a
contract
with
that
firm
at
a
fair
and
reasonable
price.
and
if
there
is
no
such
qualified
firm
or
if
no
firm
is
willing
to
fulfill
the
contracting
need
at
a
fair
and
reasonable
price,
then
bia
turns
the
contract
over
to
open
competitive
bidding.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
i
will
attempt
to.
now,
the
controversy
in
this
case
centers
on
a
five-mile
stretch
of
indian
logging
road
that
cuts
through
indian
trust
lands
in
pushmataha
county,
oklahoma.
in
1977,
in
accordance
with
the
bia
program
i
just
described,
the
bia
contacted
three
qualified
indian
firms
in
the
normal
competitive
area
and
asked
each
to
submit
a
bid.
the
respondent,
which
is
a
non-indian
corporation,
was
not
asked
to
bid
and
subsequently
the
contract
was
awarded
to
indian
nations
construction
company,
a
company
wholly
owned
by
three
indians.
the
price
that
it
was
awarded
at
was
considered
to
be
fair
and
reasonable
both
by
bia
and
the
national
highway
administration.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
think
that
as
we
detailed
in
our
brief
that
the
earlier
reports
--
the
buy
indian
act
itself
was
enacted
in
1910.
however,
suitable
language
appeared
in
a
series
of
appropriations
acts
between
1884
and
1908,
almost
identical
language.
and
the
temporary
administrative
reports,
that
is
reports
that
were
required
by
congress
to
be
filed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
reflected
all
during
this
period,
including
1910
and
thereafter,
that
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
the
secretary
considered
the
buy
indian
act
and
the
preference
contained
in
the
act
to
apply
not
only
to
goods,
as
respondent
argues,
but
also
construction
of
all
kinds.
for
example,
the
1908
appropriations
act
specifically
expressly
applied
the
preference
to
irrigation
construction
and
a
road
on
the
hooper
valley
indian
reservation
and
it
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
there
was
a
predecessor
act
which
has
the
same
language
and
therefore
should
be
construed
similarly,
and
in
1910
when
the
act
was
enacted
the
legislative
history
and
again
the
contemporary
administrative
reports
show
that
congress
intended
the
act
to
apply
to
construction
as
well
as
to
goods.
the
1910,
1911,
1912
reports
all
show
that
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
considered
it
their
duty
to
employ
indians
and
to
hire
indian
teams,
which
are
the
sort
of
forerunners
of
today's
modern
corporation.
certainly
at
that
time
indians
didn't
have
corporations,
but
they
did
have
entrepreneurs
who
had
teams.
and
rep.
sherman's
statement,
which
is
quoted
at
page
23
of
our
brief,
i
believe,
and
a
subsequent
comment
in
1910
by
rep.
burke
all
show
that
they
expected
the
act
to
be
applied
to
irrigation
construction,
and
i
don't
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
you
can
distinguish
meaningfully
between
irrigation
construction
and
road
construction.
it
is
still
construction.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
they
did
not.
it
has
been
a
consistent
interpretation.
the
language
of
the
act
is
certainly
broad
enough
to
encompass
construction.
the
word
"product"
as
defined
by
the
dictionary
encompasses
anything
that
human
effort
produces
or
creates,
and
that
certainly
includes
road
construction.
an
example
of
a
very
common
usage
of
the
word
"product"
to
include
construction
is
the
gross
national
product.
that
includes
goods,
services,
and
construction
work
in
the
nation
in
a
particular
year,
and
that
is
a
very
common
usage
going
back
for
quite
some
time.
so
the
word
"product"
doesn't
take
any
strain
of
the
imagination,
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested,
to
construe
the
word
"product"
to
encompass
construction
work.
and
we
think
that
congress'
intent,
and
the
consistent
administrative
interpretation
should
have
been
deferred
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
and
those
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
would
think
--
yes,
i
would.
industry,
if
you
are
talking
about
an
industry
in
a
technical
sense,
certainly
the
construction
industry
is
considered
to
be
an
industry
and
"industry"
in
the
sense
of
work
or
energy,
certainly
you
have
indians
working
on
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
and
the
respondent
concedes
that
the
buy
indian
act
would
apply
to
an
indian
corporation
today
that
produced
electronic
computers,
and
you
would
not
think
of
that
as
a
typical
product.
in
fact,
both
the
legislative
history
and
the
administrative
reports
show
quite
clearly
that
there
was
an
anticipation
that
indians
would
engage
in
all
kinds
of
modern
industry,
and
there
was
a
whole
--
by
use
of
preference
legislation
like
the
buy
indian
act,
that
in
fact
indians
could
finally
rid
themselves
of
dependence
and
that
they
would
eventually
become
self-sufficient.
for
example,
in
the
1911
report,
the
annual
report
of
the
secretary,
he
states,
"indians
all
over
the
country
are
entering
gradually
into
ordinary
industrial
activities,"
indicating
that
there
was
a
hope
and
an
anticipation
and
recognition
that
the
buy
indian
act
would
apply
to
these
kinds
of
activities
and
that
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
these
were
annual
reports
that
were
submitted
each
year
by
both
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
the
department
of
the
interior
to
congress
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
it
did.
in
the
various
reports
they
talk
about
insofar
as
practicable
we
have
been
using
indians
in
accordance
with
legislation
to
do
this
and
do
that,
to
hire
teams
and
to
employ.
now,
they
didn't
say
"buy
indian
act,"
but
the
words
"so
far
as
practicable"
appears
in
the
reports
and
the
words
"so
far
as
practicable"
appears
in
the
statute,
and
the
only
inference
--
and
this
is
the
only
legislation
of
that
time
which
directed
the
indian
affairs
bureau
to
employ
indian
labor
and
to
purchase
products,
and
so
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
is
what
they
were
referring
to,
i
think,
and
that
was
the
anticipation.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
follow
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
they
could
but
not
under
the
buy
indian
act.
i
mean
there
is
various
legislation
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
i
think
they
would.
it
would
apply
to
that.
the
1974
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
in
1974,
congress
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
i
think
it
would,
but
that
is
because
in
1974
congress
passed
the
indian
financing
act
of
1974
which
specifically
directs
the
bia
to
start
new
industries,
to
fund
the
money
and
to
develop.
there
is
an
indian
development
bureau
which
was
created
in
1974
under
the
financing
act,
and
the
whole
point
of
that
act
is
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
once
the
business
got
started,
the
bia
would
be
entitled
to
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right,
but
as
soon
as
it
got
started
--
i
mean
i'm
not
sure
what
that
--
in
any
event,
we
think
that
the
construction
of
the
words
"products
of
indian
industry"
should
be
given
a
liberal
construction.
it
is
not
only
supported
by
the
legislative
history
and
what
we
consider
to
be
a
consistent
and
long-standing
administrative
practice,
but
also
by
two
very
important
policy
considerations.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
reiterated
over
and
over
again
in
cases
such
as
in
the
last
term
wilson
v.
omaha
indian
tribe
and
alaska
pacific
fisheries
v.
united
states
and
other
cases,
that
when
you
are
construing
a
statute
that
has
been
passed
on
behalf
of
indians,
that
you
must
give
every
reasonable
and
possible
inference
to
the
benefit
of
the
indians,
and
certainly
the
word
"product"
is
easily
stretched
or
easily
encompasses
the
word
"construction"
and
it
doesn't
take
much
imagination
to
get
it
to
road
construction.
furthermore,
the
second
policy
consideration
is
that
the
buy
indian
act
is
very
important,
it
is
not
a
theoretical
benefit
to
the
indians.
as
we
detailed
in
our
brief
and
as
also
detailed
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case,
the
impact
of
the
decisions
below
has
been
severe
on
indian
industry,
especially
in
the
field
of
construction.
it
takes
a
fair
amount
of
know-how,
money
and
expertise
to
get
into
complicated
industries
like
electronic
computers.
that
is
not
true
of
the
construction
industry,
although
there
obviously
is
some
expertise
needed.
but
there
is
a
lot
of
labor
needed
and
that
kind
of
an
industry
can
be
started
up
much
more
easily.
in
many
reservations,
the
construction
industry
or
logging
industry
are
the
most
important
employers
and
source
of
revenue.
the
effect
of
the
decisions
below
has
been
to
cut
off
in
large
part
buy
indian
contracting,
as
a
result
of
which
several
indian
firms
have
actually
gone
bankrupt
and
there
is
loss
of
employment
and
economic
dislocation
among
the
group
who
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
and
congress
over
and
over
again
as
terribly
disadvantaged.
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
assuming
that
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
products
of
indian
industry
includes
road
construction,
is
whether
the
federal
property
act,
what
i
referred
to
fpasa
in
our
brief,
impliedly
revealed
the
buy
indian
preference
in
1965.
now,
respondent
concedes
that
the
buy
indian
act
was
initially
passed
not
only
as
a
preference
for
indians
but
also
as
an
exception
to
the
general
federal
advertising
requirements.
he
also
acknowledges
that
it
continues
to
be
an
exception
even
in
1980
for
the
purchase
of
electronic
computers.
his
sole
claim
is
that
section
302(e)(b),
which
appears
i
think
at
page
41
of
our
brief
--
on
42
actually
--
impliedly
repeals
the
buy
indian
preference
as
regards
major
construction.
now,
before
turning
to
the
act
itself,
i
think
that
this
court's
unanimous
decision
in
morton
v.
mancari
is
very
instructive
on
this
point.
in
that
case,
the
question
was
whether
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
had
impliedly
repealed
a
long-standing
indian
preference,
and
this
court
said
in
the
absence
of
affirmative
indications
that
congress
intended
to
repeal
the
long-standing
preference,
the
court
would
not
construe
the
two
acts
--
the
court
would
give
each
act
force
and
would
not
find
implied
repeal.
now,
even
if
the
act
was
not
as
explicit
as
it
is
--
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment
--
about
preserving
prior
exceptions
to
the
advertising
statutes,
morton
v.
mancari,
it
seems
to
me,
indicates
quite
strongly
that
the
court
should
be
wary
of
finding
implied
repeal.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
language
of
the
1965
act
which
refers
to
the
buy
indian
act,
so
if
it
repealed
it,
it
repealed
it
implicitly.
now,
three
separate
sections
of
the
federal
property
act
expressly
state
that
there
is
an
intent
to
preserve
prior
existing
exceptions
to
the
general
advertising
statutes.
the
buy
indian
act
was
not
only
express
exception
to
what
was
then
called
revised
statute
3709,
that
is,
the
original
federal
advertising
statute,
but
it
also
talks
about
purchases
in
the
open
market
which
was
a
well
understood
phrase
in
contrast
to
advertised
bidding.
so
there
is
no
doubt,
and
respondent
concedes
that
this
was
a
well
established
exception.
section
310
of
the
federal
property
act,
which
is
printed
on
page
41
of
the
brief,
specifically
states
that
any
statute
which
was
a
prior
exception
to
revised
statute
3709
--
which
was
then
codified
at
41
u.s.c.
5
--
is
also
to
be
considered
an
exception
to
the
federal
property
act.
the
respondent
concedes
that
the
buy
indian
act
falls
within
section
310,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
now
this
is
a
case
that
is
a
fortiori
after
morton
v.
mancari
since
the
act
specifically
says
it
is
to
preserve
the
preexisting
exceptions
and
that
it
should
not
be
--
no
change
is
made
in
those
exceptions.
section
310
further
states
that
the
act
shall
be
considered
to
be
an
exception
under
section
(c)(15),
302(c)(15)
of
the
act.
now,
section
302(c)
says
basically
you
must
advertise
except
for
the
following
15
exceptions.
the
first
14
exceptions
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
am
working
my
way
there
slowly,
if
i
could.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
okay.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
all
right,
i
will
try
to
slow
down.
section
310
of
the
act,
as
i
said,
preserves
all
exceptions
and
directs
you
to
(c)(15).
now,
the
first
14
exceptions
of
subsection
(c),
302(c)
are
exceptions
to
the
advertising
rules
created
by
subsection
(c),
that
is
they
don't
depend
on
other
acts.
they
are
exceptions
created
by
the
act,
that
is
for
things
like
impractability
and
emergencies
and
exigencies
and
national
emergencies
and
professional
kinds
of
things,
experimental
research
and
a
number
of
them,
and
they
are
all
created
by
the
act.
(c)(15)
merely
recognizes
exceptions
created
by
other
law,
as
otherwise
provided
by
law.
now,
the
respondent
agrees
again
that
we
are
in
(c)(15)
and
as
to
non-construction
work
the
binding
act
constitutes
an
exemption.
he
turns
to
302
(e)(b),
however,
and
says,
ha,
302(b)
says
that
of
the
exceptions
created
by
the
federal
property
act,
seven
are
listed
and
(15)
is
not
one
of
them
and
therefore
(15)
obviously
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
major
construction.
but
(e)(b)
states
that
this
section
shall
not
be
construed
to
authorize,
if
there
is
nothing
about
what
other
sections
or
other
statutes
authorize,
and
it
is
simply
a
way
of
differentiating
among
the
14
exceptions
created
by
the
statute
itself
and
does
not
have
any
effect
or
impact
upon
an
authorization
or
an
exemption
created
by
other
law.
when
the
buy
indian
act
authorizes
the
negotiation
of
a
contract,
it
is
simply
not
a
contract
authorized
by
section
(c)(15),
it
is
authorized
by
the
buy
indian
act,
and
there
was
no
need
for
congress
to
refer
to
(c)(15)
because
(e)(b)
does
not
apply
to
those
kinds
of
other
exceptions.
this
reading
of
the
statute
i
think
is
confirmed
both
by
the
language
of
the
act
and
also
by
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
does
302(e)(b)?
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
302
(e)(b)
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
oh,
section
302.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
it
is
as
to
negotiated
contracts
which
are
authorized
by
sections
(1)
through
(14)
of
subsection
(c).
it
is
not
an
authorizing
statute
with
regard
to
advertising
which
is
authorized
by
some
other
statute.
it
simply
preserves
the
exception
that
is
created
by
the
other
statute.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
302(c)
says
all
purchase
under
contracts
for
property
and
services
shall
be
made
by
advertising,
except
that
such
purchases
and
contracts
may
be
negotiated
by
the
agency
head
without
advertising
if
--
and
it
lists
15
exceptions.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
that
is
correct.
the
agency
otherwise
has
to
have
authority
to
do
whatever
it
is
that
it
is
doing.
in
other
words,
there
may
be
authorization
for
an
agency
like
the
department
of
education
to
build
buildings,
and
the
only
thing
that
302
is
concerned
with
is
whether
once
you
have
the
authority
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question
--
once
you
have
the
authority
to
build
a
building,
do
you
have
to
advertise
the
contract
or
can
you
negotiate
a
contract.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
we
rely
heavily
on
the
word
"authorize"
but
we
also
rely
heavily
on
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
and
the
clear
intent
that
we
think
emanates
from
sections
310
and
302(a)(2)
of
the
act
as
well.
310
would
be
sort
of
rendered
meaningless
or
at
least
would
be
cut
in
half
without
explanation
if
302(e)
were
to
overrule
310
as
to
all
construction
projects.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
as
to
what
--
that's
right,
but
302(e),
the
legislative
history
to
302(e)
states
that
the
provision
simply
restates
what
is
past
law
and
that
is
if
you
look
at
the
seven
exceptions
which
are
stated
in
302(e)
and
compare
them
to
the
seven
exceptions,
the
other
seven
exceptions
in
(1)
through
(14)
which
are
not
present
there,
it
is
quite
obvious
that
the
first
seven
which
are
mentioned
would
or
could
possibly
apply
to
major
construction,
and
that
the
other
seven
could
not,
and
the
other
seven
are
items
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
no,
no.
putting
aside
the
(15)
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
no.
putting
aside
section
(15)
which
we
think
is
very
different,
the
first
13
exceptions
are
only
created
by
the
statute,
but
section
(15)
is
merely
recognized
by
the
statute
as
preserving
a
prior
exception
in
other
law?
okay.
now,
as
between
the
14
exceptions
that
appear
in
section
(e),
seven
of
them
are
excepted
also
under
section
(e).
those
seven
could
naturally
apply
to
major
construction
work.
the
other
seven
could
not.
and
congress
imply
put
this
statute
in,
as
the
legislative
history
makes
quite
clear,
to
assure
that
exceptions
(4)
through
(9)
and
exception
(13)
do
not
apply
to
construction
and
there
is
no
intent
to
appeal
the
prior
other
acts
and
are
already
contained
in
other
acts
to
negotiate
construction
contracts.
the
original
act
was
passed
in
1949
and
did
not
apply
to
bia.
it
was
amended
in
1965
to
apply
to
bia
and
every
other
agency,
and
the
legislative
history
both
times
shows
that
there
was
no
intent
to
make
any
kind
of
major
change.
and
if
congress
was
intending
to
appeal
the
buy
indian
act
and
various
other
acts
which
previously
authorized
construction
to
be
negotiated,
you
would
have
thought
there
would
have
been
something
in
the
legislative
history
and
a
more
specific
statement
in
the
language
showing
that
congress
wanted
to
do
that.
it
didn't.
the
legislative
history
says,
"for
clarity,
this
subsection
(e)
provides
that
section
302
does
not
authorize
or
change
the
existing
requirements
for
authorization
for
the
erection
and
repair
of
buildings,
roads,
sidewalks
or
similar
items."
it
didn't
change
anything.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
it
simply
made
sure
that
agencies
would
not
attempt
to
negotiate
major
construction
projects
without
bidding
based
on
the
exemptions
from
advertising
contained
in
subsections
(4)
through
(9)
and
(13).
there
was
certainly
not
an
intent
to
repeal
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
it
authorized
agencies
to
make
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right,
but
that
is
an
authorization
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
i
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i'm
not
sure
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
sense
that
it
didn't
create
any
power
of
an
agency
to
contract.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
it
did
create
power
among
the
agencies
to
negotiate
contracts
for
which
they
already
had
authority
and
it
is
a
very
simple
--
it
just
restates
what
is
obvious
from
the
face
of
section
(e).
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
first
part
was
simply
--
and
was
later
repealed
--
simply
stated
that
the
indian,
hereinafter
all
indian
service
procurement
shall
be
subject
to
the
general
advertising
statute,
that
is
revised
statute
3709,
but
we
maintain
and
we
enact
into
positive
law
the
common
preference
for
indian
goods
and
indian
products
and
indian
labor
that
heretofore
existed
in
every
appropriations
act
since
1884.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
right,
which
was
not
repealed
when
the
first
sentence
was
repealed.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
i
--
well,
it
may
--
not
302,
no,
i
don't
think
it
applies
at
all.
i
think
that
the
binding
act
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
310
tells
you
that
the
advertising
exceptions
that
previously
existed
are
preserved
in
their
entirety
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
we
think
the
buy
indian
act
also
qualifies
under
that
section,
although
we
don't
think
the
court
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
we
argue
both
in
the
brief,
but
we
think
that
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
we
think
it
quite
clear
that
the
buy
indian
act
does
qualify
under
310
and
302(c)(15).
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
section
2
of
title
xxv
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
issue
regulations
regarding
all
indian
programs.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
302(a)?
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
the
statute
is
critical,
the
subchapter
does
not
apply
to
--
the
subchapter
is
made
inapplicable
pursuant
to
any
other
law.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
but
he
has
not
relied
on
(a)(2)
in
issuing
regulations.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
there
have
been
regulations
or
policy
statements
and
the
policy
has
been
followed
before
1961.
there
is
a
reported
case
of
the
comptroller
general
in
1957
and
there
are
these
early
reports
that
we
have
described
before
that
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no.
and
prior
to
1957,
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
articulated
formal
policy,
although
the
policy
was
followed.
they
didn't
set
down
in
regulation
form
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
one
of
the
regulations
is
41
c.f.r.
14h-3.2.5.70.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
41
c.f.r.
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
14h.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
okay.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
might.
