justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levander,
are
you
going
to
cover
the
chronology
of
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
some
time
in
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
the
secretary
first
start
construing
the
buy
indian
act
to
cover
construction
of
roads?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
before
the
buy
indian
act
was
even
enacted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wouldn't
authorize
an
agency
to
go
ahead
and
make
a
contract,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levander,
in
your
brief
on
page
5,
you
say
that
the
buy
indian
act
--
in
the
footnote
--
is
the
common
name
for
section
23
of
the
act
of
june
25,
1910,
and
section
23
simply
consists
of
the
statement
that
hereafter
the
purchase
of
indian
supplies
shall
be
made
in
conformity
with
the
requirements
of
section
3709
of
the
revised
statutes
provided
that
so
far
as
may
be
practicable
indian
labor
shall
be
employed
and
purchases
of
the
products
of
indian
industry
will
be
made
in
the
open
market
in
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
do
you
rely
on
the
proviso
or
the
first
part
or
on
both?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
rely
simply
on
the
proviso
in
section
23?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he
first
issued
this
regulation
in
1961,
didn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
those
aren't
regulations.
