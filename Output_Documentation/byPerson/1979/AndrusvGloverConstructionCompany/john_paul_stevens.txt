mr.
levander,
can
i
slow
you
down
for
a
second,
because
i
am
trying
to
follow
it.
it
excepts
it
as
i
read
it
in
subparagraph
(15).
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
that
meet
the
argument
presented
by
subsection
(e)
that
follows?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
make
the
point
because
you
rely
heavily
on
the
word
"authorize"
in
(e)
as
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
still
have
viability
for
everything
except
those
things
that
are
covered
by
302(e),
namely
road
construction--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
it
seems
rather
clear
that
302(e)
was
intended
to
have
more
restrictions
apply
to
the
kinds
of
contracts
that
are
described,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
otherwise
you
wouldn't
need
(e)
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
otherwise
authorized
by
law
could
not
apply
to
major
construction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
section
302
applies
to
this
road
contract
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
event
you
never
get
to
(15),
you
don't
need
to
get
to
(15),
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
302(a)(2)
says
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
says
that
there
are
some
things
to
which
this
subchapter
doesn't
apply
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you
could
have
saved
us
a
lot
of
ear
trouble
if
you
had
just
argued
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
is
your
stronger
argument,
the
one
you
made
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
authority
does
the
secretary
claim
for
issuing
his
present
regulations
under
the
buy
indian
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
don't
think
that
--
he
has
never
claimed
any
authority
under
section
302(a)
to
issue
any
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
executive
agencies
shall
make
purchases
and
contracts
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
in
implementing
regulations
of
the
administrator,
so
his
regulations,
outstanding
regulations
now
under
the
buy
indian
act,
are
they
--
does
he
refer
to
this
section
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
argument.
i
just
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
non-construction
indian
products?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
why?
why
is
that
exempt
under
--
let's
say
under
title
5,
why
was
it
exempt
under
title
5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
that
the
buy
indian
act
was
a
provision
that
otherwise
authorized
the
purchase
of
indian
goods
without
advertising?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
whole
case
turns
on
the
definition
of
"products"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
under
title
5
before
the
passage
of
the
federal
property
act,
do
you
think
that
you
would
distinguish
between
construction
contracts
and
other
contracts
under
section
5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
bia
was
regulated
by
title
5,
but
you
just
told
me
that
title
5
would
not
require
or
section
5
would
not
require
advertising
under
the
buy
indian
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
section
5.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
it
was
a
moment
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
still
think
it
is
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
section
5
is
an
old
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
when
the
buy
indian
act
came
along
it
was
an
exception
to
title
5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hayes,
does
that
mean
that
you
have
abandoned
your
argument
based
on
subsection
(e)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
had
better
explain
why
it
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understood
the
court
below
to
place
alternative
and
separate
reliance
on
(e),
i
understand
you
in
effect
to
be
abandoning
that
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
if
you
are
right
about
products
under
the
buy
indian
act,
you
don't
need
to
reach
(e);
but
assuming
you
are
wrong
about
products,
does
it
also
take
it
out
of
(e)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hayes,
i
had
a
similar
question
about
the
definition
of
the
indian
enterprise.
you
just
described
it
in
terms
of
two
of
the
executives
being
of
partial
indian
blood.
is
there
any
requirement
that
the
ownership
of
the
company
be
in
the
hands
of
indians?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
is
true,
then
the
third
person
that
you
named
apparently
had
no
indian
blood,
was
just
merely
an
executive
of
the
company,
he
didn't
have
any
effect
on
the
eligibility
of
the
enterprise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
other
two
people
were
stockholders,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
