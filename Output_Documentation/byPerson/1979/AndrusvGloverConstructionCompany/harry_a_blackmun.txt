mr.
levander,
the
word
"product"
is
not
used
by
itself,
it
is
used
as
products
of
indian
industry.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
normally
think
of
road
construction
as
a
typical
product
of
indian
industry?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
the
normal
interpretation
you
get
in
just
wording
the
words
"products
of
indian
industry"?
doesn't
that
convey
a
message
that
products
of
industries
in
which
indians
typically
engage?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
think
it
does?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
differ
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
as
to
what
the
consistent
administrative
construction
has
been?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
hayes,
may
i
ask
a
question.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
described
the
officers
of
this
indian
company
and
they
didn't
sound
a
lot
like
indians
to
me.
who
determines
--
does
the
statute
say
that
a
one-fourth
blooded
indian
is
an
indian
for
purposes
of
this
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
another
question,
i
think
your
brief
or
the
government's
brief
described
this
road
as
being
built
in
land
occupied
by
indians.
is
it
built
on
a
reservation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
determines
where
one
of
these
roads
may
be
built?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
relate
to
the
percentage
of
population
composed
of
indians?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
the
united
states
government
pays
for
the
roads?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
without
regard
to
whether
indian
labor
is
used
or
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
the
contractor
doesn't
obligate
the
contractor
to
use
indian
labor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
my
questions
may
be
entirely
irrelevant
to
this
case.
i
was
just
curious.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
memorandum
that
we
sued
on,
this
1976
bulletin
says
that
it
has
to
be
100
percent
indian
owned,
which
i
would
interpret
that
to
mean
that
all
the
stockholders
have
to
be
at
least
one
percent
indian.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
my
understanding,
he
is
not
a
stockholder.
he
was
one
of
the
original
incorporators
and
is
treasurer
and
general
manager
according
to
the
exhibits
that
the
government
introduced
at
a
deposition
we
took.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
there
are
three
stockholders
and
i
think
they
are
all
at
least
one-fourth
indian.
