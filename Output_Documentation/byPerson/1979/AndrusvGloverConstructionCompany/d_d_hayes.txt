mr.
d.
d.
hayes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
glover
construction
company's
position
is
that
five
miles
of
roadway
costing
$1.2
million
and
located
in
pushmataha
county,
oklahoma
is
not
a
product
for
sale
on
the
open
market
and
it
is
not
indian
supplies.
we
believe
that
such
a
project
is
a
roadway
construction
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
property
act
and
as
such
is
subject
to
the
competitive
bidding
requirements
of
that
law.
the
government's
main
thrust
has
been
that
the
word
"products"
as
used
in
the
buy
indian
act
should
be
broadly
and
liberally
defined
to
include
roadway
construction
because
of
the
policy
of
resolving
doubtful
expressions
in
favor
of
the
indian
people.
we
are
aware
that
this
court
has
on
several
occasions
announced
that
policy;
however,
we
believe
that
policy
has
no
application
to
this
case.
based
on
the
facts
that
were
developed
in
the
district
court,
those
facts
show
that
the
indian
community
in
general
does
not
benefit
from
the
bia's
interpretation
of
this
statute.
the
facts
that
were
developed
in
the
district
court
show
that
the
beneficiaries
of
this
interpretation
were
the
owners
of
indian
nations
construction
company.
the
president
of
that
company
is
a
one-fourth
degree
indian
who
is
an
administrative
law
judge
for
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
by
occupation.
the
vice
president
of
that
company
was
a
one-quarter
blood
choctaw
who
is
a
self-employed
rancher
and
who
states
his
net
worth
at
just
under
a
half
million
dollars.
the
treasurer
and
general
manager
of
that
corporation
is
a
non-indian
and
he
states
his
net
worth
at
$1.3
million.
now,
based
on
the
reports
that
we
have
seen
from
the
american
indian
policy
review
commission,
the
indians
are
desperately
in
need
of
roads.
the
report
indicates
that
the
roadway
systems
are
about
40
percent
inadequate,
that
they
don't
have
enough
money
budgeted
to
build
enough
roads.
basically,
the
crux
of
the
report
is
that
they
need
more
roads
than
there
is
money
to
buy.
now,
what
is
important
about
that
is
that
in
1976
glover
construction
company
built
the
first
five
miles
of
this
road
for
$538,000,
and
for
less
than
what
the
engineer
estimated
the
cost
would
be.
the
second
five
miles
of
this
same
road
in
1977
cost
$1.2
million
without
competitive
bidding
and
was
22
percent
above
the
estimate
that
the
engineers
said
it
would
cost
to
build
it.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
i
agree,
your
honor,
it
was
quite
different,
but
i
think
the
significant
point
is
that
we
built
it
for
less
than
the
bia's
engineer
estimated
it
would
cost,
and
also
its
specifications
were
changed,
they
built
it
for
--
they
let
a
contract
to
build
it
for
22
percent
more
than
what
it
was
estimated
it
would
cost.
based
on
these
reasons,
and
another
reason
that
we
think
it
doesn't
benefit
the
indians
is
there
is
absolutely
not
one
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record,
not
one
shred
of
credible
evidence
that
any
indian
workmen
are
employed
on
this
$1.2
million
project.
now,
we
don't
think
it
benefits
the
indians.
we
don't
think
it
gets
them
enough
road
built,
we
think
it
is
more
expensive
and
we
don't
think
it
is
creating
any
jobs
under
this
interpretation.
now,
we
think
that
the
usual
methods
of
interpreting
and
construing
statutes
ought
to
be
applied
to
case.
we
think
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
buy
indian
act
was
simply
a
proviso
to
section
23
of
the
act
june
25,
1910
and
that
section
23
was
a
remedial
statute,
and
the
obvious
purpose
of
passing
this
remedial
statute
was
to
correct
intolerable
abuses
in
purchasing
and
contracting
within
the
indian
service
which
was
the
predecessor
to
the
bia,
and
this
is
made
clear
from
rep.
burke's
remarks
where
he
says
that
at
that
time
the
indian
service
was
interpreting
the
1908
act
to
permit
them
to
engage
in
virtually
unregulated
purchases
and
that
this
was
resulting
in
indefensible
abuses.
so
they
passed
this
statute
to
remedy
that
problem.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
but
that
the
rule
that
this
court
has
previously
announced
and
previously
followed
is
that
remedial
statutes
ought
to
be
interpreted
to
achieve
the
remedy
that
the
congress
prescribed.
applying
that
rule
to
this
case,
that
statute
ought
to
be
interpreted
liberally
to
correct
the
defect
and
to
promote
competitive
bidding.
now,
we
also
think
it
is
significant
that
the
buy
indian
act
was
a
proviso.
it
is
almost
uniformly
held
that
a
proviso
should
be
strictly
construed.
it
is
almost
uniformly
held
that
the
proviso
should
be
construed
in
light
of
the
enacting
clause
of
the
statute.
it
is
almost
uniformly
held
that
the
national
limitation
of
the
proviso
is
to
those
things
previously
mentioned
in
the
enacting
clause
and
that
no
case
is
taken
out
of
the
enacting
clause
unless
it
falls
fairly
or
plainly
within
the
terms
of
the
proviso.
now,
to
interpret
the
word
"products"
to
include
roadway
construction
i
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
violate
or
disregard
every
one
of
these
usual
rules
of
statutory
construction.
we
have
to
forget
that
the
purpose
of
the
enacting
clause
in
this
statute
was
to
require
competitive
bidding
on
indian
supplies.
likewise,
we
have
to
liberally
construe
the
proviso,
instead
of
strictly
construe
it,
and
the
lower
courts
said
that
you
couldn't
even
get
there
with
a
liberal
interpretation.
you
also
have
to
forget
the
subject
matter
that
congress
was
regulating.
congress
was
regulating
indian
supplies.
they
were
not
regulating
construction
projects,
and
we
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
kind
of
indian
supplies
that
was
exempt
from
competitive
bidding
are
products
of
indian
industry,
that
they
weren't
talking
about
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
well,
i
think
it
is
a
construction
contract
and
i
believe
you
are
talking
about
the
federal
property
act,
is
that
correct?
yes,
we
believe
that
this
is
covered
by
the
federal
property
act
and
that
it
is
a
contract
for
services.
but
what
i
am
speaking
of
just
now
is
the
original
act
of
1910
where
what
they
were
talking
about
and
the
only
thing
they
mention
in
the
enacting
clause
was
indian
supplies.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
that
was
in
the
proviso.
they
mentioned
indian
labor
in
the
proviso,
but
in
the
enacting
clause
i
believe
the
only
thing
they
mentioned
is
indian
supplies.
at
any
rate,
you
are
absolutely
correct,
they
do
mention
indian
labor
in
the
proviso.
we
think
that
it
is
also
apparent
that
this
act
of
1910
was
not
designed
to
cover
roadway
construction
by
comparing
this
act
with
the
act
that
it
was
designed
to
repeal,
which
is
the
act
of
april
30,
1908.
and
the
important
thing
to
note
in
the
act
of
april
30,
1908
is
that
that
act
contains
standard
construction-type
language.
the
language
in
the
pertinent
part
read
that
hereafter
supplies
may
be
purchased,
contracts
let
and
labor
employed
for
the
construction
of
artesian
wells,
ditches,
and
other
work's
of
irrigation,
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
without
advertising.
now,
that
is
the
act
of
1908,
and
then
congress
comes
along
two
years
later
and
passes
this
act
for
the
express
purpose
of
repealing
that
act
and
they
deleted
the
language
that
i
just
read.
and
we
think
the
rule
is
that
when
congress
passes
a
revising
statute
in
the
place
of
an
original
statute
and
they
leave
out
a
provision
from
the
original
statute,
they
intended
to
repeal
that
provision
and
make
it
annulled.
and
in
order
to
apply
this
statute,
the
act
of
1910
to
roadway
construction,
i
think
you
have
to
rewrite
the
statute
to
put
that
language
back
into
it,
and
i
don't
think
that
is
what
congress
wanted
done.
at
any
rate,
we
believe
that
the
court
is
confronted
with
a
very
clear-cut
choice.
you
can
define
the
word
"products"
by
looking
at
a
dictionary
definition.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
i
certainly
do.
i
will
address
that
right
now,
if
i
might.
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1910.
according
to
the
report
of
the
american
indian
policy
review
commission,
the
bia
or
the
federal
government
first
got
involved
in
roadway
construction
under
the
bia's
road
program
in
1935.
the
solicitor's
opinion
which
first
applies
or
first
authorized
supplying
the
bia's
present
interpretation
of
roadway
construction
is
dated
1971.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
well,
there
wasn't
any
evidence
in
the
district
court,
but
if
the
competitive
bidding
laws
have
applied
all
along,
and
they
have,
and
if
the
solicitor's
opinion
in
1971
says
for
the
first
time
that
it
is
legal
to
exempt
it
from
competitive
bidding,
they
had
to
be
building
those
projects
by
competitive
bidding.
my
client
built
one
in
1976
by
competitive
bidding,
and
we
believe
--
and
the
evidence
isn't
clear
on
this
point,
but
we
believe
that
from
1935
to
1971,
they
had
to
be
building
these
roads
by
competitive
bidding.
and
we
also
believe
that
the
court
should
give
great
weight
to
the
interpretation
of
the
bia
when
they
first
commenced
the
road
building
program
in
1935,
because
that
is
the
point
closer
in
time.
the
complained
of
bulletin
which
for
the
first
time
makes
it
mandatory
to
give
the
jobs
without
competitive
bidding
to
an
indian-owned
company
is
dated
march
3,
1976.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
no,
i
do
not.
i
believe
that
section
5,
as
i
understand
the
legislative
history,
section
5
applied
from
--
it
was
originally
enacted
in
the
middle
1800's
and
applied
up
to
1949
when
the
federal
property
act
was
passed.
and
we
believe
that
during
that
period
of
time
it
covered
roadway
construction
and
that
is
why
we
believe
that
when
the
bia
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
believe
that
when
this
act
was
passed
in
1910
that
it
did
exempt
certain
products
of
indian
industry,
but
it
obviously
did
not
exempt
roadway
construction
and
the
congress
didn't
intend
for
it
to
exempt
roadway
construction
because
congress
wasn't
even
in
the
business
of
roadway
construction
at
that
time.
they
didn't
get
into
it
until
25
years
later.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
we
believe
that
the
buy
indian
act
can
be
applied
to
non-construction
products.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
because
of
the
buy
indian
act.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
yes,
sir.
i
believe
it
does.
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
i
believe
that
it
applies
to
non
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
that's
correct,
i
believe
it
does.
i
think
congress
made
that
distinction,
because
i
think
in
each
one
of
these
relevant
statutes,
congress
has
seen
fit
to
treat
construction
work
separate
from
other
products.
they
treated
it
separately
in
the
act
of
1908,
they
treat
it
separately
in
the
federal
property
act
or
section
302.
they
deal
with
it
separately.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
section
5
does
it,
but
i
think
the
buy
indian
act
would
permit
the
secretary,
when
it
was
practicable,
in
purchasing
indian
supplies
to
buy
those
products,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
distinction.
i
think
that
the
bia
was
regulated
by
section
5
of
title
41
until
the
federal
property
act
was
applied
to
them.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
your
honor,
i
think
what
i
said
is,
with
all
due
respect,
is
that
title
5
is
a
general
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
--
section
5
was
a
general
advertising
statute.
now,
the
buy
indian
act
is
arguably
an
exception
to
that
with
regard
to
products
of
indian
industry.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
okay.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
i
think
it
is
an
exception
to
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
it
was
a
limited
exception
applying
only
to
certain
products
of
indian
industry
available
in
the
open
market.
it
did
not
exempt
them
entirely
from
the
application
of
section
5,
and
we
believe
it
didn't
exempt
them
from
roadway
construction.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
well,
our
whole
case,
mr.
justice,
is
that
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
no,
it
doesn't,
not
at
all.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
section
(e)
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
perhaps
i
haven't
been
clear.
our
position
is
that
the
buy
indian
act
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
section
302(e)
or
(e)
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
if
this
court
should
construe
products
to
be
roadway
construction
and
the
buy
indian
act
exempts
roadway
construction,
then
the
question
arises
is
did
(e)
imply
the
repeal
of
the
buy
indian
act
to
that
extent.
okay.
well,
i
don't
think
it
did.
i
am
sure
this
court
is
well
aware
of
morton
v.
mancari,
but
i
think
that
case
is
very,
very
different
from
this
case.
in
that
case,
they
were
dealing
with
a
very
specific
statute
that
came
right
out
and
said
in
1935
unequivocally
that
there
is
going
to
be
an
employment
preference
for
indians
within
the
bia.
all
right.
when
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1949,
when
they
decided
that
under
no
circumstances
could
road
construction
not
be
subject
to
competitive
bidding,
nobody,
including
the
bia
was
interpreting
products
to
mean
roadway
construction.
the
solicitor's
opinion,
dated
'71,
said
the
practice
may
have
been
going
on
for
ten
years.
so
it
places
an
intolerable
burden
on
congress
when
they
pass
a
law
in
1949
to
assume
that
twelve
years
later
the
indian
department
is
going
to
come
up
with
a
new
interpretation
of
the
word
"products."
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
i
agree
with
that
statement,
but
i
think
that
congress
has
drawn
a
distinction
between
products
of
indian
industry
and
construction,
and
i
think
they
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
that
is
our
position
and
we
believe
it
is
congress'
position
because
in
1908
if
they
had
wanted
it
to
apply,
they
had
construction
language
and
when
they
intended
an
act
to
apply
to
construction
they
said
contracts
let
for
construction
of.
if
they
intended
for
this
act
in
1910
to
apply
to
that,
we
think
they
would
have
said
contracts
let
for
the
construction
of,
instead
of
leaving
that
language
out.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
based
on
the
administrative
reports
that
i
have
seen,
in
1935
the
federal
government,
through
the
bia,
got
into
the
road-building
program.
now,
how
they
were
built
before,
i
must
assume
it
was
done
by
the
states
and
the
counties.
that
was
not
a
matter
that
was
put
into
evidence
at
the
district
court
level.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
at
any
rate
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
that
is
our
position.
as
i
indicated,
in
1935,
section
5
of
title
41
applied
to
the
bia
and
they
were
required
to
go
by
competitive
bidding.
then
in
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
not
on
indian
products.
but
we
think
congress,
as
i
have
indicated
before,
we
think
congress
treated
products
and
construction
differently.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
no.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
well,
your
honor,
we
just
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
i
respect
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
your
honor
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
okay.
the
solicotor's
opinion,
which
is
dated
1971,
says
that
as
far
back
as
1961
we
have
been
applying
the
buy
indian
act
to
roadway
construction.
all
right.
if
in
1935
the
regular
competitive
bidding
act
applied
and
they
first
started
applying
the
buy
indian
act
in
1961,
then
it
just
inescapably
follows
that
they
were
doing
it
according
to
regular
competitive
bidding
practices
during
the
intervening
period.
also
we
have
some
--
there
other
side
has
not
--
of
course,
we
don't
have
access
to
that
information
after
the
district
court,
and
there
has
been
no
evidence
from
the
other
side
that
they
commenced
in
1935
when
the
program
began
of
applying
the
buy
indian
act.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
law
was
at
that
time
and
it
still
is
that
they
were
required
to
do
it
by
competitive
bidding.
now,
we
have
to
assume
that
they
followed
the
law
until
they
say
they
stopped
following
it,
and
they
indicate
through
the
solicitor's
opinion
that
they
have
quit
following
the
law
in
1961.
we
know
for
a
fact
that
we
built
the
first
five
miles
in
1976
under
competitive
bidding,
and
as
far
as
we
know
it
came
as
a
shock
to
us
because
we
thought
they
had
always
done
it
by
competitive
bidding
until
we
were
deprived
of
the
right
to
bid
for
the
first
time
in
1977.
in
answer
to
one
question,
i
didn't
get
it
completely
answered
about
the
possibility
of
an
implied
repeal.
we
think
that
this
court
itself
has
indicated
that,
in
applying
the
morton
v.
mancari
case,
this
court
itself
indicated
at
footnote
2
of
that
case
that
section
47
was
a
more
narrowly
drawn
statute
than
section
12
which
was
at
issue
in
that
case.
this
court
also
indicated
that
for
all
practical
purposes
in
footnote
2
that
section
47,
along
with
some
other
sections,
had
been
replaced
by
section
12.
so
we
don't
think
that
the
morton
v.
mancari
rule
can
be
applied.
we
don't
think
because,
number
one,
congress
could
not
have
possibly
envisioned
that
this
would
be
applied
to
roadway
construction
in
1949
when
that
law
was
enacted;
and,
secondly,
because
it
is
not
as
broad
a
statute
as
section
12
was.
thank
you.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
it
says
--
and
the
government
can
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
but
i
think
if
they
are
even
one
percent
indian
they
are
considered
to
be
an
indian
for
purposes
of
this
statute.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it
is
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
there
is
a
statute
--
and
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
cite
--
that
sets
out
the
bia's
jurisdiction
over
certain
roads.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know
how
they
determine
it.
it
is
just
that
congress
gave
them
a
particular
jurisdiction
by
statute
to
maintain
certain
roads.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
yes,
your
honor,
the
united
states
government
pays
for
it.
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
obviously
in
this
case
regardless
of
whether
indian
labor
was
used
or
not,
because
--
mr.
d.
d.
hayes
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
the
memorandum
does
not
address
indian
labor
either
that
we
sued
for.
