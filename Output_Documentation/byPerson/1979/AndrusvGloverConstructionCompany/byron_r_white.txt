justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
bureau
or
the
secretary
ever
construe
it
as
not
to
apply
to
construction?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
report
in
connection
with
this
legislation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
that
particular
comment
have
any
specific
relationship
to
the
enactment
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
the
indian
industry
from
which
products
may
be
purchased
must
precede
the
contract,
the
existence
of
the
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
the
government
finance
the
indian
industry
at
the
same
time
that
it
gives
a
contract
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they
could,
but
would
they
be
required,
would
they
be
permitted
to
buy
from
that
industry
without
advertising?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
industry
was
not
pre-existing?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
this
was
the
first
time
the
indians
had
ever
been
in
this
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
i
am
wondering
about
the
buy
indian
act
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
must
have
gotten
started?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
were
going
pretty
fast
for
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
levander,
does
section
302
itself
authorize
construction
contracts?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
302
an
authorizing
statute
or
merely
a
statute
that
spells
out
the
procedure
that
shall
be
followed
when
construction
is
otherwise
authorized?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
the
whole
section
302.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
an
authorizing
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
language
in
section
302
authorizes
the
government
to
do
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
cite
to
his
regulations
under
the
buy
indian
act
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
41
--
justice
byron
r.
white
give
me
the
first
number,
41
c.f.r.
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
view
before
that
time,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
the
government's
argument
that
section
5
of
title
41
does
not
apply
to
a
construction
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
required
advertising.
justice
byron
r.
white
can't
indian
products
change?
let's
assume
there
was
an
electronics
business
started
on
a
reservation
and
the
united
states
wanted
some
electronic
--
the
bia
wanted
to
get
some
electronic
products.
it
may
have
been
fifty
years
ago
that
this
wasn't
an
indian
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
whenever
a
road
was
built,
it
just
never
was
a
product,
that
is
just
not
within
the
reach
of
the
word
"product."
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
must
have
been
an
awful
lot
of
roads
built
from
1910
on
indian
reservations.
is
it
your
suggestion
that
they
have
always
been
built
on
competitive
bidding?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
from
'35
to
'71
you
think
they
were
built
on
competitive
bidding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
on
services,
not
on
indian
products.
