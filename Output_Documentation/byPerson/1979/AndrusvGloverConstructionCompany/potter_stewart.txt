well,
it
didn't
really
authorize
anything
either,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
simply
set
down
procedures
to
be
followed.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
my
brother
stevens'
point,
that
section
302(e),
when
it
says
this
section
shall
not
be
construed
to
authorize
the
erection,
repair
or
furnishing
of
any
public
building
or
public
improvement,
that
such
authorization
shall
be
required
in
the
same
manner
as
heretofore,
is
in
a
way
unnecessary
since
section
302,
the
entire
section
didn't
authorize
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
it
set
down
certain
procedures
to
be
followed.
justice
potter
stewart
to
carry
out
previous
authorizations.
justice
potter
stewart
existing
authorizations.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
the
topography
was
quite
different,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
referred
to
indian
labor.
justice
potter
stewart
your
whole
case
really
depends
upon
the
proposition
that
roadway
construction
is
not
indian
products
available
in
the
open
market,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
your
whole
case?
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
these
are
indian
products
available
in
the
open
market,
you
have
just
said,
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
my
brother
white,
they
would
not
be
subject
to
competitive
bidding.
