although
17(a)(2)
of
the
1933
act
does
not
by
its
terms
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
indicate
a
requirement
of
scienter,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
unlike
10(b)(5)
as
at
least
as
construed
in
the
hochfelder
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
10(b),
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
my
suggestion
to
you
is
that
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
end
of
your
injunction
case,
you
will
have
satisfied
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
hochfelder
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
if
you
can
show
that
he
is
about
to
do
it
again
and
you've
already
told
him
that
he
has
misled
somebody
and
you
have
proved
it
by
definition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
say
the
standards
are
different.
they
are
the
same
in
both
cases.
the
only
thing
is
that
you
satisfy
the
hochfelder
standard
in
putting
on
your
injunction
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
makes
it,
what
if
you
make
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
can't
do
it
negligently
again
if
he
has
been
told.
you
can't
be
careless,
he's
been
told.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you've
been
able
to
convince
the
judge
that
to
get
your
injunction
that
he
is
liable
to
perform
this
action
again.
that's
the
only
way
you
are
going
to
get
your
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
does,
he
can
hardly
complain
or
defend
on
the
ground
that
his
second
performance
was
careless.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
in
a
commission
injunction
action,
the
only
thing
the
commission
can
show
about
past
conduct
is
that
it
was
negligent.
i
suppose
the
defendant
could
at
least
make
an
argument
that,
well,
maybe
i
did
it
but
it
was
careless
only,
it
was
only
negligent,
it
wasn't
intentional
and
therefore
you
shouldn't
issue
an
injunction.
you
should
at
least
wait
until
i
do
it
again
knowingly.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
violate
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
have
to
be
found
that
this
was
deceptive.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
knowing.
