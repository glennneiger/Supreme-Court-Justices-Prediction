mr.
barry
m.
fallick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
concerns
an
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
which
had
permanently
enjoined
the
petitioner
from
violating
the
anti-fraud
provisions
and
the
registration
provisions
of
the
securities
acts
of
1933
and
1934.
the
issue
that
is
raised
in
this
appeal
is
whether
scienter
is
a
necessary
element
in
an
action
for
injunctive
relief
under
section
10(b)
and
rule
10b-5
and
under
section
17(a)
of
the
1933
act.
the
facts
surrounding
the
issuance
of
the
permanent
injunction
are
quite
short
and
simple.
petitioner
was
employed
by
a
company
known
as
e.
l.
aaron
&
company,
a
company
owned
by
his
father.
from
1974
through
the
beginning
of
1975,
e.
l.
aaron
&
company
was
making
a
market
in
the
common
stock
of
a
company
known
as
lawn-a-mat
chemical
&
equipment
corp.
during
that
period
of
time,
a
branch
office
was
opened
in
roslyn
heights,
new
york.
two
registered
employees
of
e.
l.
aaron
&
company
sent
to
that
branch
office
and
during
their
time
there
they
made
misrepresentations
concerning
the
financial
status
and
health
of
lawn-a-mat
and
also
concerning
future
manufacturing
ideas
concerning
lawn-a-mat.
the
district
court,
while
finding
that
mr.
aaron
did
not
make
any
false
misrepresentations,
nevertheless
said
he
willfully
aided
and
abetted
a
violation
of
the
anti-fraud
provisions
by
failing
to
prevent
him
employees
from
continuing
in
those
statements
they
made.
of
course,
mr.
aaron
was
not
an
owner
of
e.
l.
aaron
&
company,
nor
was
he
an
officer
of
e.
l.
aaron
&
company.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
said
that
it
did
not
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
scienta
and
based
on
its
long-term
policy
said
that
the
standard
in
injunctive
actions
under
section
10(b)
would
be
a
negligence
standard.
thus,
the
first
issue
was
whether
under
section
10(b)
there
should
be
a
standard
of
scienter
in
injunctive
actions.
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
well,
standards
under
the
sections
concerning
injunctive
relief,
whether
the
defendant
is
engaged
or
likely
to
engage
in
a
violation
of
certain
sections
or
regulations
of
the
securities
law,
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
if
that
is
the
same
standard
under
the
federal
65.
in
the
hochfelder
case,
this
court
had
the
opportunity
to
construe
the
meaning
of
section
10(b)
in
the
context
of
a
private
damage
action.
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
that
court's
decision
which
indicates
that
a
different
standard
should
be
applied
here.
in
hochfelder,
this
court
relied
on
the
language,
legislative
history
and
administrative
history
of
section
10(b)
to
determine
that
that
language
connotes
intentional
conduct.
of
course,
when
section
10(b)
was
enacted,
congress
did
not
contemplate
that
there
would
be
a
private
damage
cause
of
action,
therefore
the
language
and
the
history
should
reflect
congressional
determination
and
intention
concerning
injunctive
relief
under
section
10(b).
the
government
relies
heavily
on
the
capital
gains
case
in
which
this
court
in
1940
stated
that
there
is
a
difference
between
fraud
in
law
and
fraud
in
equity.
in
that
case,
capital
gains,
mr.
justice
goldberg
heavily
relied
upon
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
investment
advisers
act,
and
this
court
has
said
that
that
interpretation
is
premised
on
congressional
belief
that
there
should
be
standards
concerning
federal
fiduciary
relationship
with
investment
advisers.
in
addition,
mr.
justice
goldberg
was
clearly
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
injunctive
relief
in
capital
gains
was
mildly
propylactic.
here,
however,
in
the
normal
course
of
security
business,
injunctive
relief
is
no
longer
considered
mildly
prophylactic.
there
is
a
loss
of
reputation,
a
loss
of
business,
subject
to
administrative
and
criminal
proceedings.
courts
no
longer,
especially
in
the
second
circuit,
consider
injunctive
relief
to
be
mildly
propylactic.
thus,
because
the
statutory
text
of
capital
gains
is
of
course
different
than
under
10(b),
because
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
investment
advisers
act,
and
because
of
the
premise
that
injunctive
relief
is
mildly
propylactic,
and
it
was
in
that
case.
that
case
was
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
case
at
bar.
there
is
also
an
issue
presented
here
concerning
whether
injunctive
relief
should
be
premised
on
a
standard
of
scienter
under
section
17(a)
of
the
1933
securities
act.
several
courts,
several
commentators
have
recently
commented
upon
section
17(a).
the
fifth
circuit,
in
construing
subsection
(1)
of
17(a),
said
the
language
there,
especially
the
words
"device,
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud"
clearly
connote
that
congress
intended
that
a
standard
of
scienter
be
established.
of
course,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
steadman
case
was
relying
on
the
language
of
this
court
in
hochfelder.
the
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
whatever
standard,
especially
it
should
be
a
scienter
standard,
is
established
under
10(b),
it
should
also
govern
under
section
17(a).
these
two
sections
are
so
closely
related,
they
both
serve
the
same
function,
that
it
is
clear
that
congressional
intent
should
be
that
the
language
should
be
construed
to
establish
that
the
standard
of
liability
for
injunctive
relief
under
10(b)
is
a
scienter
standard.
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
by
its
terms,
no,
it
does
not.
in
fact
--
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
10(b)(5)
is,
of
course,
relying
upon
its
promulgating
statute
which
would
be
10(b).
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
17(a)
stands
alone.
however,
it
is
our
position,
because
the
language
of
17(a)
is
so
similar
to
that
of
10(b)
and
10(b)(5)
and
the
statutes
serve
the
same
function,
that
using
the
--
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
it
is
different
from
10(b),
similar
to
10(b)(5)
and
the
investment
advisers
act
206.
while
it
is
different,
we
contend
that
it
should
have
the
same
standard
of
scienter,
otherwise
we
will
be
an
anomaly
between
the
'33
act
and
the
'34
act
concerning
the
standard
of
liability.
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
there
are
other
differences
--
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
the
purposes
are,
of
course,
different
but
--
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
the
two
measures
are
both
general
anti-fraud
measures
concerning
deceptive
sales.
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
powell,
in
answer
to
your
question
concerning
the
real
implication
of
a
permanent
injunction,
it
would
be
a
loss
of
business,
loss
of
reputation,
and
the
practical
effect
would
the
person
would
be
out
of
business,
especially
for
a
small
broker
as
was
e.
l.
aaron
&
company.
the
loss
of
regulation
was
devastating.
they
went
out
of
business
and
mr.
aaron,
of
course,
is
no
longer
in
the
securities
business.
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
once
a
defendant
has
been
put
on
notice
that
his
past
conduct
is
negligent
and
he
persists
in
that
conduct,
of
course,
then
he
is
making
a
conscious
effort
to
--
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
--
to
violate
the
law.
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
if
a
defendant
--
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
not
at
all.
one
of
the
factors
in
issuing
injunctions
--
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
past
conduct
is
negligent,
but
of
course
if
he
continues
and
persists
and
says
he
doesn't
believe
that
it
was
negligent
and
he
is
going
to
continue
doing
it
and
there
is
a
motive
to
continue
and
it
is
going
to
be
some
type
of
personal
gain,
then
of
course
his
future
conduct
would
create
a
standard
--
mr.
barry
m.
fallick
it
certainly
would
be.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
