you
have
been
addressing
generalities,
may
i
ask
you
a
general
question.
the
commission
has
had
a
long
experience
with
injunctions
under
20(b).
as
a
practical
matter,
what
is
the
effect
of
a
permanent
injunction
against
a
brokerage
firm
or
whoever
issued
by
the
sec?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
does
it
do
to
the
defendant?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
all
of
that.
what
i
was
interested
in
is
if
you
were
the
broker
and
you
had
an
injunction,
a
permanent
injunction
against
you,
what
effect
would
it
have
on
your
business
and
daily
operations,
and
would
it
last
forever?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
was
imposed
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
go
ahead
and
then
tell
me
what
was
imposed
in
this
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
might
have
been
told
that
that
is
a
theory
of
the
sec,
but
he
might
wholly
disagree
with
it,
and
my
brother
white's
theory
puts
him
in
a
position
where
he
can't
voice
his
disagreement
except
at
the
risk
of
an
injunction
against
him.
