chief

e.

in
a
contempt
setting,
counsel,
is
it
not
necessary
to
show
scienter
before
a
contempt
order
could
be
entered
and
sustained?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
taking
it
one
step
beyond
his.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ferrara,
i
don't
recall
that
either
you
or
your
friend
have
touched
the
subject
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
review
and
in
its
opinion
went
beyond
what
it
needed
to
go
with
respect
to
the
findings
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
were
the
findings
specifically
of
the
district
court
with
reference
to
this
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
being
so
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
was
an
alternative
holding
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
ring
like
an
alternative
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
could
have
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
lesser
standard,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
then
you
do
not
regard
that
part
of
the
holding
as
dictum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
they
could
have
acted
and
decided
the
case
on
a
narrower
ground?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
clear
that
the
court
describes
that
as
its
holding,
and
i
was
trying
to
go
behind
the
language
of
the
court
and
see
whether
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fallick,
do
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
undertaken
to
reserve
more
than
two-thirds
of
your
time
for
rebuttal
and
i
assume
you
will
confine
yourself
to
rebuttal
material.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
