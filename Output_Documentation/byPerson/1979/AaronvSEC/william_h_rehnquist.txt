justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fallick,
in
your
question
presented
for
decision
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
when
you
refer
to
the
government
enforcement
by
injunction
of
these
acts,
do
you
think
there
is
fairly
assumed
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
65
et
cetera,
relating
to
injunctions,
regardless
of
whether
the
particular
statutes
contain
a
requirement
of
scienter
or
not
when
enforcement
is
brought
by
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
"deceived"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
he
not
require
any
--
it
is
simply
the
making
of
a
statement
which
is
not
true
without
reward
to
the
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
person
making
the
statement
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
true?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
something
of
a
tradition
built
up
around
the
first
part
of
this
century
against
what
is
called
government
by
injunction,
that
is
that
it
is
easier
for
the
government
to
go
out
and
get
an
injunction
against
a
person
not
requiring
intent,
simply
enjoining
them
from
disobeying
the
law
and
then
prosecuting
them
on
a
civil
contempt
standard
when
they
disobey
a
law,
rather
than
bringing
what
might
otherwise
be
a
criminal
prosecution
against
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
case
of
someone
who
is
charged
with
simple
negligence
and
you've
made
out
your
case
of
simple
negligence,
and
now
you
are
trying
to
show
that
he
is
apt
to
violate
the
act
by
simple
negligence
again.
that
is
quite
a
difficult
showing
to
make.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
if
he
was
negligent
in
simply
failing
to
supervise
his
employees,
if
the
government
says
you
still
have
a
lousy
operation,
you
haven't
get
your
house
in
order
and
your
employees
are
running
around,
would
you
say
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
that
the
government
has
made
out
a
scienter
standard
or
just
a
likelihood
to
again
continue
to
be
negligent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ferrara,
in
section
10(b)
of
the
'34
act,
with
respect
to
the
words
"manipulative,
deceptive
and
contrivance,"
would
you
say
that
any
of
those
implied
any
state
of
mind
or
culpability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
taken
in
the
context
in
which
congress
enacted
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
what
we
usually
do,
isn't
it?
