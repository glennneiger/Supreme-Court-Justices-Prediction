mr.
ferrara,
let
me
ask
you,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
ought
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
case.
if
you
are
going
to
bring
an
injunctive
action,
you
are
going
to
--
by
the
time
you
have
served
your
complaint,
the
defendant
is
going
to
be
put
on
notice
as
to
what
he
has
done.
he
has
already
known
what
he
has
done
all
right
and
he
knows
that
the
government
is
going
to
claim
that
he
has
misled
somebody.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
you
can
show
that
after
knowing
that,
after
knowing
that
that
he
is
about
to
do
it
again,
he
is
never
going
to
be
able
to
say
that
he
didn't
intend
to
mislead
somebody.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
he
disobeys
an
injunction
obtained
after
that
kind
of
a
showing,
courts
have
to
have
some
way
of
enforcing
their
injunction.
i
would
suppose
they
could.
