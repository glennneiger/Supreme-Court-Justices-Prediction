mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
believes
that
in
an
enforcement
action
brought
by
the
commission,
when
a
federal
district
court
judge
finds
that
a
defendant
has
engaged
in
conduct
which
has
deceived
the
public
in
connection
with
a
securities
transaction
and
he
finds
that
unless
enjoined
the
defendant
is
likely
to
continue
to
engage
in
that
conduct,
he
may
grant
injunctive
relief
without
showing
that
the
defendant
acted
with
scienter.
in
short,
the
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
in
the
federal
securities
laws,
what
is
prohibited
in
section
10(b)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
is
the
employment
of
a
deceptive
device.
deceptive
in
that
context
is
an
effect
word
that
reaches
for
the
effect
of
the
misconduct
on
the
investor.
if
the
investor
has
been
misled,
then
he
has
been
deceived
and
it
is
actionable,
we
would
submit,
under
section
10(b).
is
that
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
now,
you
have
to
sort
between
both
acts,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
securities
act
and
the
exchange
act.
under
section
10(b),
the
section
that
i
began
with,
the
commission
would
submit
that
a
deceptive
act
may
be
enjoined
by
a
federal
district
court
judge
if
he
finds
that
it
is
likely
to
recur.
the
fact
that
somebody
has
engaged
in
the
past
in
a
deceptive
act
is
for
purposes
of
a
commission
action
not
significant.
remember,
the
commission's
injunctive
action
under
section
10(b)
is
predicated
upon
a
showing
that
a
defendant
is
engaged
or
is
about
to
engage
in
a
violation
of
any
of
the
sections
of
the
exchange
act.
so
what
the
commission
need
show
is
that
someone
has
engaged
in
misconduct
which
is
reasonably
likely
to
deceive,
reasonably
likely
to
reoccur,
and
then
a
federal
district
court
judge,
exercising
his
discretion,
may
enter
an
injunction.
the
question
of
the
defendant's
subjective
state
of
mind
doesn't
enter
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
deception
has
occurred.
that
is
what
section
10(b)
speaks
to.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that
is
absolutely
correct.
in
hochfelder,
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
stated
with
near
surgical
precision
the
context
within
which
that
case
was
going
to
be
decided,
namely
whether
or
not
scienter
was
going
to
be
required
in
a
private
action
for
money
damages
under
section
10(b),
and
in
that
context
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
reasoning
in
hochfelder
was
that
they
were
intent
words
in
the
context
of
that
case,
and
that
was
quite
appropriate
in
hochfelder
because
in
a
private
damage
action,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
real
issue
for
the
plaintiff
is
to
demonstrate
that
the
defendant
has
engaged.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
and
once
there
is
a
determination
that
the
defendant
has
engaged,
then
monetary
relief
assuming
causation
and
the
other
requirements
follows.
that
is
a
much
different
legal
context
than
when
the
commission
brings
an
action
for
injunction.
in
that
context,
the
word
"deception"
--
not
deceive,
recall
section
10(b)
does
not
prescribe
deceit,
it
prescribes
deceptive
practices
or
deceptive
devices
--
in
that
legal
context,
we
think
the
language
of
section
10(b)
takes
on
a
shade
of
different
meaning.
and
i
might
add,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
nothing
strange
to
the
law
and
the
canons
of
statutory
construction,
this
court
has
found
that
to
be
the
case
before.
sec
v.
national
securities,
for
example,
comes
to
mind,
an
opinion
in
which,
as
i
recall
it,
you
concurred
in
part
and
dissented
in
part.
in
that
opinion,
writing
for
the
majority
of
the
court,
mr.
justice
marshall
commented
that
the
word
"sale"
could
take
on
different
meanings
in
the
context
of
the
registration
provisions
and
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
act.
in
doing
that,
mr.
justice
marshall
noted
that
even
congress
had
intended
in
the
definitional
sections
of
the
securities
act
that
the
words
listed
in
there
should
have
the
meaning
stated
unless
the
context
otherwise
required.
and
if
my
recollection
serves
me
correct,
you
dissented
in
part
from
that
portion
of
mr.
justice
marshall's
opinion,
writing,
for
the
majority,
but
even
in
that
dissenting
footnote
i
think
you
said
while
definitional
problems
are
reasonably
related
in
private
actions
and
in
sec
enforcement
actions,
it
is
not
plainly
inconsistent
to
give
different
shades
of
meaning
because
of
the
different
context
within
which
those
two
actions
arise.
so
the
position
that
the
commission
is
taking
here
is
consistent
with
principles
of
statutory
construction
i
think
that
this
court
has
utilized
in
prior
cases
generally
and
in
prior
securities
cases
specifically.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
your
question
raises
several
subquestions.
let
me
try
to
deal
with
each.
first,
is
there
a
bias
or
was
there
a
bias
at
common
law
at
the
turn
of
the
century
against
governmental
injunctive
actions.
we
would
also
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
chief
justice,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
but
it
is
a
slightly
different
question
than
the
one
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
me.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
the
question
of
whether
or
not
civil
contempt
would
be
an
abuse
of
governmental
process,
and
you've
asked
the
question
of
whether
criminal
contempt
should
lie
without
a
showing
of
intentional
or
reckless
misconduct.
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
is
civil
contempt
may
lie.
recall
that
civil
contempt
is
contempt
that
is
imposed
by
the
court
to
require
the
offending
party
to
engage
in
an
affirmative
act.
there,
for
example,
if
a
party
was
enjoined
by
the
court
to
file
an
updated
report
with
the
commission
and
he
refused
to
do
so,
then
civil
contempt
would
lie.
mr.
chief
justice
burger's
question
is
would
criminal
contempt
lie.
that
raises
a
slightly
different
context.
criminal
contempt
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
i
think
after
the
filing
of
the
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
correct.
that
i
think
is
the
heart
of
the
chief
justice's
question.
criminal
contempt
usually
lies
when
someone
has
violated
the
terms
of
a
prohibitory
injunction,
and
that
i
think
is
different
than
civil
contempt.
i
think
mr.
justice
white's
question
goes
to
the
issue
of
not
whether
or
not
contempt
would
lie
against
a
defendant
after
a
complaint
has
been
brought,
because
contempt
will
only
lie
once
an
injunction
has
been
entered,
but
rather
whether
or
not
perhaps
additional
proceedings
might
be
warranted
against
that
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
assuming
that
his
conduct
is
continuing,
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
at
times
you
--
if
the
conduct
is
actually
in
progress
while
the
injunctive
case
is
pending
--
but
i
would
agree
with
you,
you
satisfy
the
hochfelder
standard.
but
if
the
conduct
is
retrospective
conduct,
if
it
has
been
concluded
that
it
is
a
past
violation,
then
what
the
commission
needs
to
still
show,
not
just
a
past
violation
but
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
recurrence.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
if
the
defendant
is
quiescent
during
that
period
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
if
he
does
it
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it
is
indeed,
and
the
commission
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
let
me
respond
to
both
questions,
if
i
may.
unquestionably
if
all
the
commission
is
able
to
show
is
that
someone
has
failed
to
use
due
care
or,
conversely,
has
been
careless
in
making
a
misstatement
in
one
individual
isolated
instance,
then
we
think
it
would
be
perhaps
unlikely
that
a
federal
district
court
judge
applying
general
equitable
principles
applicable
to
situations
such
as
this
would
order
an
injunction
because
a
federal
district
court
judge
has
broad
discretion,
takes
many
factors
into
account
besides
the
culpability
of
the
defendant
in
order
the
injunction.
now,
mr.
justice
white's
question
is
let's
assume
that
the
commission
meets
that
standard,
let's
assume
that
we
show
not
only
culpability
but
also
other
factors
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
if
he
does
not
do
it
negligently
again,
then
we
think
criminal
contempt
could
lie
because
the
injunction
has
put
him
very
specifically
on
notice
as
to
what
his
misconduct
was.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that
it
is
reasonably
likely
that
he
is
to
perform
the
act
again,
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
he
--
well,
we
would
hope
that
he
would
hardly
be
able
to
contend
that,
but
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
contempt
the
question
raised
by
the
chief
justice
is
he
presumably
would
go
into
the
criminal
courts
saying
at
best
i
was
careless
the
second
time,
i
didn't
violate
the
terms
of
the
decree
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
the
government
at
that
point
would
have
two
options
to
pursue.
one,
it
could
seek
criminal
contempt
against
the
defendant
demonstrating
that
because
he
has
been
specifically
put
on
notice
by
the
prior
injunction
in
an
admonitory
way
that
his
conduct
violates
the
law,
that
the
second
time
he
is
engaged
willfully
or
knowingly
in
a
violation
of
the
federal
securities
laws,
contempt
will
lie.
or
the
commission
alternatively
could
go
back
against
the
same
defendant,
demonstrating
that
the
perhaps
further
judicial
relief
is
appropriate.
the
key
i
think
to
the
commission's
position
on
this
case
is
not
that
the
commission
intends
to
go
out
and
to
willy-nilly
issue
or
ask
courts
to
issue
injunctions
against
people
who
have
done
nothing
more
than
fail
to
exercise
due
care.
to
the
contrary,
though,
the
commission's
position
is,
again,
once
someone
--
once
a
federal
district
court
judge
makes
determination
that
someone
has
engaged
in
misconduct
which
has
resulted
in
a
deception
and
is
reasonably
likely
to
recur,
that
federal
district
court
judge
should
not
be
powerless
to
enter
an
injunction.
now,
if
the
conduct
that
the
commission
demonstrates
is
in
fact
intentional
conduct
or
scienter,
as
used
in
the
hochfelder
case,
then
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
a
very
high
likelihood
that
the
federal
district
court
judge
will
enter
the
injunction.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendant's
conduct
was
singular
and
wholly
faultless,
drawing
on
a
term
from
the
hochfelder
opinion,
then
it
is
far
less
likely
that
a
federal
district
court
judge
would
utilize
his
discretion
to
enter
the
injunction.
and
in
that
gray
area
of
what
runs
between
wholly
faultless
conduct
and
intentional
conduct
--
and
i
suppose
there
are
gradations
there
of
culpability
which
include
gross
negligence,
recklessness,
knowing
conduct,
scienter,
intentional
conduct,
willful
conduct,
and
so
on
--
depending
on
the
gradation
that
the
commission
demonstrates,
i
think
you
increase
the
likelihood
that
an
injunction
will
be
entered.
again,
it
is
critical
to
keep
in
mind
that
for
the
commission's
case,
as
opposed
to
a
private
action,
the
substantive
provision,
10(b),
and
the
authorization
to
seek
an
injunction,
21(d)
of
the
exchange
act,
actually
have
to
merge.
merely
proving
a
past
violation
doesn't
get
you
there,
and
that
is
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
hochfelder,
and
that
is
the
extraordinarily
different
legal
context
in
which
this
case
is
presented,
the
context
that
requires
that
injunctions
be
issued
not
be
precluded
absent
a
showing
of
scienter.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
you
will
note
in
the
comment
that
i
just
made
perhaps
somewhat
of
a
response
to
a
comment
you
made
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
hockfelder,
that
the
action
should
not
depend
upon
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff.
the
commission
continues
to
agree
with
that.
the
commission's
position
here
is
that
the
operation
of
section
10(b)
doesn't
depend
on
whether
the
plaintiff
is
the
commission
or
a
private
party.
the
distinction
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
action,
the
totally
different
legal
context
of
an
equitable
action
versus
an
action
for
money
damages,
which
i
might
add
is
consistent
with
the
issue
that
was
reserved
in
the
hochfelder
opinion
in
footnote
12.
recall,
the
majority
opinion
in
footnote
12
of
hochfelder
specifically
reserved
the
question
of
whether
scienter
need
be
shown
in
an
injunctive
proceeding
under
section
10(b)
or
rule
10(b)(5).
it
didn't
reserve
the
question
necessarily
of
whether
an
sec
enforcement
proceeding
need
not
show
scienter.
it
is
the
quality,
the
character,
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
that
makes
the
coloration
of
the
words,
the
interpretation
of
the
words,
the
statutory
construction
principles
that
are
applicable
different,
not
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff.
well,
if
i
may,
i
have
covered
a
good
many
of
the
things
that
i
wanted
to
talk
on
today,
but
perhaps
i
could
spend
a
moment
or
two
detailing
some
of
the
other
considerations
that
the
commission
would
like
to
bring
to
bear
on
this
question.
first,
picking
up
and
continuing
on
this
thread
of
the
need
for
the
commission
to
proceed
without
an
absolute
showing
of
scienter
in
its
injunctive
actions,
i
think
that
to
fail
to
do
so
would
really
fail
to
recognize
some
very
important
distinctions
that
are
--
and
standards
of
culpability
that
are
included
in
other
provisions
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
for
example,
in
other
governmental
proceedings
the
congress
very
carefully
chose
words
of
culpability,
willfully,
reasonable
care,
good
faith,
reasonable
grounds
to
believe,
purpose,
and
so
on.
those
words
we
think
are
peculiarly
absent
from
section
10(b).
they
are
also
absent
from
the
provisions
that
authorized
the
commission
to
bring
its
injunctive
proceedings.
that
is
important,
and
the
reason
it
is
important
is
because
congress
in
defining
the
array
of
enforcement
powers
that
the
commission
has
used
those
words
of
culpability
in
other
specific
provisions.
for
example,
the
commission
has
various
enforcement
alternatives
available
to
it.
one
of
those
enforcement
alternatives
is
an
administrative
proceeding.
there
congress
reached
and
used
a
specific
word
of
culpability,
willfully.
the
commission
also,
working
with
the
department
of
justice,
can
refer
a
case
for
criminal
prosecution,
another
specific
remedy
provided
to
the
commission.
there
the
congress
also
chose
another
very
specific
word
of
culpability,
willfully.
this
we
don't
think
was
inadvertent,
that
in
the
final
section
of
the
act
--
not
the
final,
but
another
section
of
the
act,
authorizing
the
commission
to
seek
injunctive
relief,
the
congress
specifically
declined
to
use
standards
of
culpability
but,
rather,
used
a
different
locution.
the
congress
chose
to
say
the
commission
can
seek
an
injunction
upon
a
proper
showing,
so
the
congress
moved
from
words
of
culpability
to
burden
of
proof
problems,
different
concept.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
again,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
depends
upon
the
context
within
which
the
case
arises.
in
an
equitable
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
again
--
i
can
take
them
in
the
context
in
which
congress
enacted
them,
and
that
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
--
and
that
context
recognized
that
common
law,
this
very
distinct
division
between
actions
at
fraud
at
law
and
actions
at
fraud
and
equity.
congress
realized
that
at
the
time,
so
that
is
the
context.
in
that
context,
the
word
"manipulative"
does
take
on
an
actions
at
law,
money
damage
actions,
an
intent
connotation
and
an
intent
character.
in
a
commission
injunctive
action
at
equity,
if
the
effect
of
the
action
is
manipulative,
perhaps
the
commission
should
be
able
to
seek
an
injunction.
also
manipulative,
when
used
in
the
exchange
act,
is
indeed
a
word
of
art,
as
mr.
justice
powell
noted
in
his
majority
opinion
in
hochfelder.
but
that
word
of
art
doesn't
only
cover
the
wash
sales
the
matched
orders,
the
kinds
of
manipulation,
classic
manipulation
that
i
think
the
court
was
referring
to
in
the
context
of
that
case.
the
context,
again
following
up
with
your
question,
the
context
is
manipulative
when
you
look,
for
example,
at
section
9(a)(4)
of
the
exchange
act,
contained
in
the
general
manipulative
section,
also
reaches
false
statements
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
a
person
to
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security
on
an
exchange,
all
wrapped
within
the
concept
of
manipulation,
the
context
within
which
congress
intended
those
words
to
be
used.
when
you
get
around
to
your
other
two
words,
device
and
contrivance,
first
there
is
nothing
in
those
two
words
themselves
that
necessarily
connote
a
form
of
intentional
misconduct.
i
agree
that
webster's
--
when
you
read
the
webster
definitions
of
device
and
contrivance,
there
is
that
--
you
can
read
in
that
element
of
intent,
but
i
can
note
for
you
that
in
the
exchange
act
itself,
congress
--
that
is
your
context
--
congress
used
the
words
device
and
contrivance
virtually
interchangeably
with
the
words
acts
and
practices.
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
section
15(c)(1)
and
15(c)(2)
of
the
exchange
act,
and
more
importantly
you
read
the
legislative
history
that
accompanies
those
two
sections,
and
why
the
congress
wrote
section
15(c)(1)
and
15(c)(2)
the
way
that
they
did,
i
think
it
is
illustrative
of
the
point
that
those
concepts
were
roughly
interchangeable.
also,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
section
10(b),
again
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
the
senate
report,
reporting
out
the
bill
that
ultimately
became
the
exchange
act
as
modified
by
the
house
bill,
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
senate
report
refers
to
section
10(b)
as
prescribing
the
use
of
manipulative
or
deceptive
acts
and
practices.
so
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
you
can
look
at
the
words
standing
along
or
in
isolation
or
outside
of
the
context
within
which
they
were
passed
and
say
that
in
an
equitable
proceeding
congress
absolutely
intended
that
the
commission
demonstrate
scienter,
particularly
when
in
a
footnote
that
runs
on
for
two
pages
in
our
brief
--
particularly
when
in
that
footnote
the
congress
otherwise
used
a
whole
array
of
culpability
words.
it
certainly
knew
how
to
use
them
when
it
wanted
to
--
a
whole
array
of
culpability
words,
and
didn't
here.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
district
court
found
that
the
defendant
knew
of
the
misconduct
of
the
people
that
were
under
his
supervision
and
also
had
reason
to
know
that
they
were
making
false
statements
because
as
part
of
his
managerial
responsibilities
at
the
firm,
that
he
maintained
the
due
diligence
files.
due
diligence
files
are
files
containing
current
and
accurate
financial
information
that
are
required
to
be
maintained
by
market
makers,
those
who
affirmatively
sell
stock
for
their
own
account.
well,
the
court
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
let
me
respond
to
your
question.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
district
court
found
that
he
had
acted
knowingly
and
with
reason
to
know
and
accordingly
had
met
the
scienter
standards
of
hochfelder
and
then
went
on
to
find
that
under
either
a
negligence
or
a
scienter
theory
of
liability,
the
defendant
was
liable.
that
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
district
court
found
that
under
either
a
negligence
or
scienter
theory
of
liability,
the
defendant
should
be
enjoined.
that
question
goes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
only
went
so
far
to
reach
that
portion
of
the
district
court's
conclusions
of
law
that
said
negligence
could
suffice,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
unanimous
panel
said
we
think
negligence
is
the
appropriate
standard,
that
is
as
far
as
we
have
to
do,
and
that
is
as
far
as
the
court
went.
the
only
time
the
court
of
appeals
spoke
to
the
question
of
the
defendant's
scienter
was
in
part
five
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
where
the
court
noted
that
the
district
court
judge
had
properly
taken
the
scienter
of
the
defendant
into
account
in
determining
whether
to
issue
an
injunction.
so
the
court
of
appeals
only
addressed
the
scienter
question
in
that
limited
context,
that
is
whether
the
district
court
properly
issued
an
injunction
and
not
in
the
context
of
establishing
liability.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
district
court
judge
did
not
express
it
that
way.
the
district
court
judge
said
that
either
under
a
negligence
or
a
scienter
theory
he
was
liable.
i'm
not
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
yes,
i
think
it
does.
in
just
looking
at
the
words,
either
one
or
the
other
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it
could
have,
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
said
i
suppose
that
--
well,
one
of
the
issues
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
conduct
amounted
to
scienter,
as
the
district
court
judge
had
found,
or
alternatively
whether
the
district
court
judge
was
clearly
erroneous
in
that
regard.
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
said
we
are
going
to
review
the
district
court's
determinations,
we're
going
to
find
that
the
defendant
acted
with
scienter,
therefore
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
resolve
the
question
of
whether
negligence
or
the
appropriate
standard.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do
that.
the
court
of
appeals
only
went
to
the
negligence
question,
which
was
perfectly
appropriate
for
it
to
do,
given
the
two
bases
of
the
district
court's
conclusion.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
oh,
no,
not
at
all.
that
is
the
essential
holding
of
the
case.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i'm
not
sure
that
because
a
court
could
have
decided
the
case
on
a
different
ground
it
necessarily
means
the
ground
that
it
decided
it
on
was
dicta.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
case.
as
i
say,
had
the
court
--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
i
think
had
the
second
circuit
said
that
we
affirm
the
district
court's
findings
of
scienter
and
then
said
but
we're
going
off
on
a
negligence
standard
of
liability,
then
i
think
perhaps
the
standard
the
court
chose
may
have
been
dicta.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do
that.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
we
are
only
reaching
the
negligence
question.
in
concluding,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
moment
if
i
may
in
saying
why
or
explaining
why
the
commission
took
really
the
unusual
step
of
asking
this
court
to
grant
certiorari
in
this
case,
even
though
the
district
court
found
in
its
favor
on
all
of
the
counts
charged
in
its
complaint
and
entered
a
final
judgment
of
permanent
injunction
and
even
though
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
unanimous
decision
affirmed
the
district
court,
and
even
though
the
commission
believes
that
both
lower
courts
were
correct
in
their
holding
and
in
their
conclusion
that
scienter
was
not
required
in
the
commission
injunctive
action.
in
doing
that,
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
what
the
commission
is
contending
in
this
court
and
perhaps
more
importantly
what
it
is
not
contending
in
the
court.
as
this
court
knows,
in
the
past
several
years
the
commission
has
participated
before
this
court
in
several
cases
where
private
parties
have
raised
important
issues
under
the
federal
securities
laws
and
have
raised
questions
regarding
the
scope
and
effectiveness
of
those
laws,
and
oftentimes
the
commission
and
i
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
commission
or
the
solicitor
general
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
commission
have
appeared
before
the
court
to
express
the
view
that
private
damage
actions
play
an
essential
role
in
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
securities
laws,
that
they
serve
as
an
essential
supplement
to
the
commission's
own
enforcement
actions.
well,
the
court's
message
has
been
i
think
that
however
laudable
the
purpose
of
private
actions,
the
proper
scope
of
those
private
actions
is
to
enforce
the
federal
securities
laws
are
quite
limited.
the
court's
restrictions
i
think
of
the
substantive
provisions
that
can
serve
as
a
basis
for
private
enforcement
of
the
federal
securities
laws,
as
in
the
lewis
v.
transamerica
case,
the
court's
definitions
of
the
requirements
for
private
actions
to
enforce
the
federal
securities
laws,
as
under
the
blue
chip
stamps
and
hochfelder
case,
have
had
a
number
of
significant
effects
on
how
the
laws
are
enforced,
and
i
think
perhaps
the
most
significant
effect
that
it
has
had
is
the
fact
that
it
has
shifted
the
balance
of
the
manner
in
which
these
laws
have
to
be
enforced.
the
government,
which
has
always
had
the
primary
role
for
enforcing
the
federal
securities
laws
has
to
take
on
now
an
even
greater
burden,
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
that
is
why
we
asked
that
this
court
take
this
action.
scienter
simply
cannot
be
a
prerequisite
for
a
commission
injunctive
action.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
i
think
that
the
injunction
has
three
very
critical
things
--
well,
let
me
respond
in
two
ways.
one,
the
injunctive
provision
is
the
commission's
principal
enforcement
tool,
the
only
tool
that
we
really
have
against
the
great
masses.
we
don't
assess
fines.
we
don't
assess
penalties.
we
only
seek
injunctions,
with
the
exception
of
the
regulated
community.
so
it
is
our
primary
enforcement
tool,
and
the
commission
is
primarily
a
law
enforcement
agency.
we
are
unlike
the
fcc
and
the
host
of
other
independent
regulatory
agencies.
we
are
not
primarily
a
regulator
or
a
licensor.
we
are
a
law
enforcement
agency,
and
this
is
our
principal
tool.
now,
what
does
the
injunction
do?
well,
we
think
that
it
brings
the
defendant's
attention
in
a
very
focused
way
to
his
past
infractions,
it
lays
down
in
an
admonition
for
the
defendant
as
to
what
is
expected
of
him
in
the
future,
and
it
gives
--
it
stimulates
i
think
future
compliance
with
the
federal
securities
laws
through
a
judicial
mandate.
it
is
those
three
objectives
that
we
seek
in
seek-injunctive
actions,
and
that
is
really
again
all
we
have.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
there
are
some
collateral
consequences
that
attach
to
the
issuance
of
an
injunction.
certainly,
those
who
have
been
found
to
have
carelessly
engaged
in
misconduct
which
results
in
a
deception
of
investors
and
a
federal
district
court
judge
has
found
it
reasonably
likely
to
recur
and
they
are
therefore
enjoined
are
going
to
suffer
some
inconveniences.
on
the
other
hand,
the
statutory
collateral
consequences
that
can
attach
to
the
entry
of
an
injunctive
decree
are
largely
discretionary.
in
other
words,
any
defendant
in
an
injunctive
action
that
has
a
collateral
consequence
attach,
a
regulatory
disability,
for
example,
of
not
being
able
to
serve
as
an
investment
adviser
to
an
investment
company,
a
regulatory
disability
that
relates
to
whether
or
not
that
issuer,
if
it
is
an
issuer
of
securities,
can
use
the
regulation
a
exemption.
all
of
those
collateral
consequences
are
discretionary.
the
defendant
in
injunctive
proceeding
can
seek
to
have
the
regulatory
collateral
consequences
not
apply.
the
commission
has
to
take
into
account
all
of
the
factors
that
are
raised
by
the
respondent
in
that
collateral
proceeding,
he
has
full
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
been
very
rigorous
with
the
commission,
saying
that
they
cannot
act
arbitrarily
or
capriciously
in
having
the
collateral
consequences
attach
--
i
mean,
there
is
a
host
of
protections.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
thee
are
two
specific
regulatory
disabilities
that
could
be
imposed
that
i
recall.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
two
specific
regulatory
disabilities
i
believe
is
that
under
section
9(a)
of
the
investment
company
act,
the
enjoined
broker-dealer,
if
it
had
an
investment
adviser
subsidiary,
would
be
precluded
from
serving
as
an
investment
adviser
to
a
registered
investment
company.
that
had
no
application
in
this
case
because
aaron
&
company
as
far
as
i
know
did
not
have
an
investment
adviser
subsidiary.
when
that
does
happen,
section
9(c)
of
the
investment
company
act
allows
the
defendant
to
come
in
to
the
commission
and
seek
to
have
that
regulatory
disability
waived.
usually
what
happens
when
a
broker-dealer
or
investment
adviser
is
involved
in
an
injunctive
action,
is
that
the
regulatory
disability
and
the
injunctive
proceeding
are
resolved
all
at
the
same
time.
the
second
disability
that
comes
into
play
is
that
the
broker-dealer
may
not
be
able
to
participate
in
offerings
of
securities
under
regulation
a.
that
is
an
exemption
from
the
full
registration
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
laws,
but
again
that
regulatory
disability
can
be
waived
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
regulation
a
itself.
now,
can
the
injunction
ever
be
lifted?
the
courts
have
procedures
for
lifting
the
injunctions.
i
believe
this
court
in
the
swift
case
laid
down
what
the
standards
are
and
that
at
any
time,
conceivably
from
the
day
after
the
injunction
has
been
entered
to
any
time
in
the
future,
the
defendant
in
an
injunctive
proceeding
can
go
back
before
a
federal
district
court
and
ask
to
have
the
injunctive
decree
resolved
because
of
reasons
articulated
by
the
court
in
the
swift
case.
thank
you.
