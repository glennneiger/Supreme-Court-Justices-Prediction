well,
my
question
was
whether
--
isn't
the
language
of
17(a)(2)
different
from
that
of
10(b).
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
show
that
he
is
likely
to
do
it
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
automatically
if
he
does
it
again
he
will
be
doing
it
knowingly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
have
already
--
you've
got
him
into
court,
you
said
here
is
what
you
did,
here
is
why
it
was
wrong,
here
is
how
it
misled
somebody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
a
question
of
contempt,
not
of
securities
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
that
you
could
conceive
of
the
government
being
able
to
show
that,
well,
he
did
it
negligently
in
the
past
and
carelessly,
and
he
is
liable
to
do
it
again,
even
though
he
has
now
been
told
that
it
was
deceptive,
and
he
is
so
likely
to
deliberately
violate
the
law
in
the
future,
that
an
injunction
could
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
wouldn't
object
to
that
if
they
could
make
such
a
showing
as
that?
