justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887
authorizes
the
award
of
money
damages
against
the
united
states
for
alleged
mismanagement
of
forest
located
on
lands
allotted
to
indians
under
that
act.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
act
does
not
expose
the
united
states
to
such
liability.
the
act
authorizes
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
allot
each
indian
residing
on
a
reservation
specified
acreage
of
agricultural
and
grazing
land.
under
section
5
of
the
act,
the
united
states
retained
title
to
such
allotted
lands
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
allottees.
pursuant
to
the
act,
the
government
allotted
all
of
the
land
in
the
quinault
reservation's
to
individual
indians.
respondents
are
individual
allottees
of
land
in
that
reservation,
the
quinault
tribe
which
now
hold
some
allotments
in
unincorporated
association
of
the
allottees.
they
brought
action
consolidated
in
the
court
of
claims
to
recover
damages
from
the
government
for
alleged
mismanagement
of
timber
resources
found
on
the
reservation.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
section
5
of
the
act
holds
a
fiduciary
duty
on
the
government
to
manage
timber
resources
properly
and
constitutes
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
against
a
suit
for
money
damages
as
compensation
for
breaches
of
that
duty.
we
disagree.
we
hold
that
the
act
created
only
a
limited
trust
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
allottee
and
that
does
not
impose
any
duty
upon
the
government
to
manage
timber
resources.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
plainly
indicates
that
the
trust
language
of
section
5
was
enacted
simply
to
prevent
alienation
of
allotted
lands
and
to
ensure
that
the
allottees
would
be
immune
from
state
taxation.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stevens
has
joined.
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
