mr.
claiborne,
in
your
brief
you
indicate
one
and
only
question
is
presented,
but
doesn't
the
question
embrace
at
least
two
--
two
questions?
first
of
all
is
there
a
private
right
of
action
created
and
secondly,
if
so,
as
the
answer
--
if
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes,
does
the
defendant
have
sovereign
immunity?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
if
congress
had
a
created
a
prior
right
of
action,
it
would
thereby
waive
the
sovereign
immunity.
justice
potter
stewart
but
nonetheless,
aren't
--
aren't
there
two
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
against
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
but
does
generically
--
arguably,
covered
it
says,
â€œthe
court
of
claims
shall
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit
for
liquidated
or
unliquidated
damages
in
cases
not
sounding
in
tort
and
that
would
generically
include
the
law
of
trust
or
any
other
law
except
tort.
wouldn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
--
i
am
now
doing
so
too.
justice
potter
stewart
everything
else.
justice

it's
not
permitted
by
the
tucker
act.
it
is
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
the
tucker
act
originally
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
same
year?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

the
tucker
act
laws
in
the
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
tucker
act
add
or
fund
any
expressed
or
implied
contract
to
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice

600
f.2d
1332?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
mason
case,
the
plaintiffs
were
not
an
indian
tribe?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
didn't
involve
1505.
it
involved
1491?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
bivens
case
and
last
term
a
passman
case
also
help
you
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
relied
on
the
other
case
which
held
that
the
only
jurisdiction
was
the
takings
clause
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
noticed
that
the
two
cases
are
mentioned,
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
were
held
to
confer
private
rights
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
not
a
mine
run,
plain
vanilla
trust,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
distinction
uses
the
word,
trust,
but
it
also
provides
that
there
shall
be
an
allotment
to
individual
indians
and
it's
the
individual
indians
who
have
control
of
the
property
unlike
a
mine
run
trust,
where
the
trust
--
where
the
trustee
does.
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
restitution?
