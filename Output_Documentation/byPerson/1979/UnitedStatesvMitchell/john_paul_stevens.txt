mr.
claiborne,
before
you
--
before
you
leave
that
line
of
inquiry
that
mr.
justice
white
raised
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
response
to
his
question
about
the
ordinary
breach
of
contract
case,
where
the
contractor
claims
the
government
defaulted
on
an
obligation
and
so
forth.
what
is
the
source
of
the
implied
cause
of
action
in
that
sort
of
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
whatever
--
whether
we're
talking
here
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
or
creation
of
cause
of
action,
whatever
we
need
in
the
way
of
statutory
authority
for
the
litigation
to
proceed,
it's
found
in
the
tucker
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
doesn't
the
law
of
trust
provide
the
remedy
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
for
the
next
question
here.
you
have
to
keep
in
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
just
be
a
stronger
case
to
recovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then,
shouldn't
this
be
a
stronger
case
for
recognizing
the
claim?
