justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
claims
doesn't
disagree
with
you
does
it
on
the
fact
that
you
must
find
some
--
some
kind
of
a
substantive
right
in
the
--
in
some
statutes
other
than
the
jurisdictional
statutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
did
just
differ
on
whether
you
do
find
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
could
you
tell
me
where
do
you
find
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
ordinary
contract
case?
and
where
do
you
find
the
implied
right?
then
united
states
just
signs
a
contract
for
a
--
a
construction
contract
to
--
to
build
a
building
or
something
and
then
it
allegedly
is
breached.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
go
ahead
and
try.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
it
--
do
you
mean
that
the
tucker
act
actually
contains
the
--
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
so
you
look
to
that
--
that
contains
the
waiver
of
sovereign,
but
it's
still
doesn't
get
you
home
because
you
must
have
a
--
implied
right
of
action
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
expressed.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
don't
--
so
that
you
don't
when
come
around
in
finding
out
if
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action,
you
aren't
--
don't
have
the
--
you
don't
approach
it
as
you
would
a
sovereign
immunity
question.
namely
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
very
strict
construction.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
it
would
expand
the
sovereign
immunity,
do
we
have
a
loose
construction?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
would
say
then
--
you
would
say
then,
if
you
were
in
a
district
court
in
a
--
in
some
kind
of
a
case
and
then
the
question
was
an
injunction,
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
there
wouldn't
be
a
sovereign
immunity
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
--
so
you
--
even
if
you
are
in
the
court
of
the
claims
and
the
issue
is
a
--
is
a
--
an
injunction,
the
--
the
party
seeking
the
injunction
might
lose,
but
not
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
be
because
of
the
limits
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
find
there
are
some
statutes
that
you
think
clearly
enough
gives
a
substantive
right
to
damages
to
a
private
individual,
if
you
just
post
that
kind
of
a
statute,
you
can
take
it
to
the
court
of
claims.
you
can
have
your
--
have
your
case
in
the
court
of
claims
and
the
sovereign
immunity
is
--
is
not
an
issue
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
you
find
the
statute
as
very
arguable
and
you
file
in
a
court
of
claims,
the
argument
is
not
sovereign
immunity,
but
the
argument
you're
making
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
plead
--
do
you
think
that
the
question
of
construing
a
statute
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
the
congress
intended
to
give
a
cause
of
action
for
damages,
you
think
that
our
--
our
constructional
problem
is
different
than
in
say,
cases
like
cort
against
ash?
you
would
--
you
would
say
those
--
that
--
that
set
of
rules
just
doesn't
apply
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
some
of
them,
but
you
would
just
say
--
you
--
you
wouldn't
say,
â€œwell,
let's
just
approach
this
problem
in
the
same
as
you
would
in
determining
whether
under
the
securities
law,
congress
intended
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
must
not
only
find
the
right,
but
the
remedy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
(voice
overlap)
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
not
available
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
if
in
the
district
court,
how
about
the
--
how
about
restitution
as
when
you
declare
that
the
act
--
the
--
a
contract
void?
how
about
if
it
involved
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
timber?
the
united
states
as
would
say
a
legally
part
of
--
with
indian
timber?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
--
and
it's
a
void
contract
and
that
the
timber
is
gone
and
the
u.s.
has
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
get
a
(inaudible)
against
the
united
states
for
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
do
you
get
the
--
and
where
do
you
get
the
--
the
cause
of
action
--
the
implied
cause
of
action
--
the
expressed
cause
of
action
as
a
constitutional
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
mean
that
--
well,
you
don't
read
it
in
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
--
you
don't
--
can
you
just
find
it
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
say
that's
the
only
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
--
that's
the
only
clause
in
the
constitution
for
which
there's
a
remedy
against
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so
yes,
your
answer
is,
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
although,
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
refers
just
to
conveyances
and
contracts.
and
any
conveyance
or
contract
with
respect
to
these
lands
until
the
expiration
of
the
allotment
period
under
that
sentence
would
be
utterly
void.
any
contract
or
conveyance
and
yet
--
yet
there
were
subsequent
acts
as
you
say,
which
said
expressly
permitted
certain
kinds
of
conveyances
and
contracts
with
respect
to
these
lands,
as
part
of
your
argument,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
any
event,
it
refers
only
to
contracts
and
conveyances
and
part
of
your
claims
for
breach
of
trust
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
conveyance
wherein
--
or
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
contract
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
--
the
failure
to
pay
interest
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
that
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
failure
to
--
to
handle
it
on
sustained-yield
basis?
it
hasn't
got
whole
lot
to
do
with
the
conveyance
or
a
contract.
well,
anyway
you
go
ahead
and
start
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
interrupt
just
a
moment?
do
you
think
technically,
this
a
jurisdictional
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
way
government
puts
it
--
they
say
the
court
of
claims
jurisdictional
statute
reads
right
on
it.
there's
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
tucker
act.
the
question
is
this,
one
of
statutory
construction
whether
or
not,
the
--
i
at
the
threshold
of
the
case,
whether
or
not,
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
permit
a
--
a
cause
of
action
for
--
for
damages.suppose
the
statute
said
there
was,
i
just
said
it
in
black
and
white.
and
suppose
another
said
there
shouldn't
be.
and
another
is
a
--
is
a
--
is
more
arguable,
you
at
least
have
a
--
you
at
least
have
a
--
the
court
of
claims
got
jurisdiction
to
figure
out
whether
the
statute
grants
a
cause
of
action
or
not.
and
if
they
decide
doesn't,
the
claimant
just
loses
his
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
a
jurisdictional
question
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
sovereign
immunity,
the
government
concedes
has
been
waived
by
the
tucker
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
to
government,
the
--
well,
i
don't
know.
it
so
depends
on
how
you
read
testan
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
the
--
and
i
don't
know
that
testan
is
--
is
any
different
in
that
regard,
in
the
government's
argument
here
that
the
way
that
you
construe
whether
the
statute
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
cause
of
action
has
--
is
--
has
been
granted.
you
should
remember
that
you're
talking
about
the
scope
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
converts
it
into
a
--
a
kind
of
a
jurisdictional
question
that
cant
--
that
--
that
the
government
--
that
the
--
that
the
normal
rules
about
raising
issues
shouldn't
apply
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
