justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
claiborne,
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
language
from
the
general
allotment
act
cited
on
page
3
of
the
government's
brief,
the
last
sentence
where
it
says,
“and
if
any
conveyance
shall
be
made
of
the
lands
set
apart
and
allotted
as
herein
provided
or
any
contract
made
touching
the
same,
before
the
expiration
of
the
time
above
mentioned,
such
conveyance
or
contract
shall
be
absolutely
null
and
void."
now,
is
that
referring
to
a
conveyance
by
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
have
an
expression
unius
argument
to
rely
on
there
that
the
--
that
the
remedy
against
the
government,
if
it
breached
its
trust
under
the
general
allotment
act,
was
simply
to
declare
the
conveyance
null
and
void?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
you
feel
indignation
mr.
hobbs,
isn't
it
the
government's
responsibility
to
call
to
the
court
of
any
--
call
the
attention
of
any
court
of
the
united
states
an
apparent
lack
of
jurisdiction
on
its
part?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
may
be
attributable
to
a
number
of
reasons.
but
once
they
spotted
it,
it
was
certainly
your
obligation
to
call
it
to
that
attention
of
the
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we've
had
jurisdictional
questions
raise
sua
sponte
in
this
court,
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
district
courts,
because
that's
the
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says
nothing
about
damages
or
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
last
language
or
the
last
sense
quoted
in
the
government's
brief
where
it
says
that,
“if
the
government
makes
a
--
conveys
in
violation
of
the
general
allotment
act,
such
contract
shall
be
null
and
void.”
isn't
there
some
argument
to
be
gained
for
the
government
there
by
saying
that
congress
specified
the
remedy
as
well
as
the
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
general
allotment
act
contemplated
only
a
skeletal
type
of
trust
to
protect
the
indians
from
the
improvident
conveyances
and
specified
within
it,
its
own
remedy,
then
that
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
outcome
of
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
you're
saying
that
it's
the
1910
act
you're
relying
on,
not
the
general
allotment
act
because
you
say
you
don't
have
to
get
into
the
question
of
whether
the
general
allotment
act
contemplated
an
elaborate
timber
management
program.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
are
you
relying
on
the
1910
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
general
allotment
act
had
said
in
exactly
the
same
words
imposed
a
trust
on
the
united
states,
then
said,
“the
exclusive
remedy
for
a
breach
of
this
duty
by
the
united
states,
shall
be
an
action
for
a
rescission.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
all
of
the
respondents
here
allottees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
1505
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
that
the
allottees
could
insist
that
they
be
permitted
to
operate
their
own
timberland,
if
they
so
desired?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
ninth
circuit
case,
that's
not
--
that's
a
--
a
case
in
this
court
is
it?
