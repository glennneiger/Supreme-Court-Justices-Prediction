mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
on
the
petition
of
the
united
states.
in
that
court,
the
plaintiffs
were,
first,
some
1500
indian
allottees
on
association
consisting
of
those
allottees
and
perhaps
others
and
the
quinault
tribe,
itself.
the
case
concerns
the
management
of
timber
on
the
quinault
reservation.
that
reservation
was
created
in
1873
by
a
presidential
order.
it
was
provided
for
some
20
years
earlier
by
a
treaty
leaving
the
location
and
dimensions
of
the
reservation
to
be
determined
by
the
president
at
some
later
time.
the
reservation
consists
of
some
200,000
acres
of
land
mostly
covered
by
timber.
some
one-third
of
that
area
has
now
been
taken
out
of
trust,
but
the
remainder
in
the
land,
we
are
told,
involved
in
this
case,
is
some
130,000
acres
of
timberland.
because
the
land
was
overgrown
with
timber,
it
was
originally
thought
that
it
was
not
appropriate
for
allotment
into
individual
parcels.
but
--
and
indeed,
that
was
the
administrative
view
until
this
court
set
the
matter
right
in
1924.
during
the
decade
that
followed
this
court's
decision
in
payne
in
1924
and
until
1933
or
1934
or
1935,
most
of
these
reservation
was
allotted
in
individual
parcels
or
indeed,
perhaps,
all
of
it
was.
typically,
there
were
80-acre
allotments
and
we're
told
some
2000
of
them.
the
tribal
interest
here
is
derivative
in
that
since
the
indian
reorganization
act,
some
small
portion
of
the
allotted
lands
have
returned
in
the
tribal
ownership,
but
a
mere
4000
acres
as
compared
to
the
very
much
larger
portion
in
individual
allotments.
beginning
in
1910,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
given
statutory
authority
to
consent
to
the
sale
of
timber
on
indian-allotted
land,
as
well
as
on
indian
tribal
land.
and
whether
or
not,
those
allotted
lands
were
technically
held
in
trust
or
were
held
by
some
restricted
patent.
in
1934,
as
a
part
of
the
indian
reorganization
act,
the
secretary
was
required
when
managing
indian
timberlands
to
do
so,
on
a
sustained-yield
basis.
these
plaintiffs
brought
this
action
in
the
court
of
claims
alleging
a
number
of
complaints
against
the
secretary's
management
of
their
timberlands.
they
said
that
he
had
failed
to
obtain
a
fair
market
value
in
the
sales
contracts.
that
he
had
failed
to
manage
it
on
sustained-yield
basis.
that
he
failed,
in
some
cases,
to
obtain
any
payment
for
the
timber.
that
he'd
not
developed
the
proper
system
of
roads
and
that
he'd
made
improper
charges
against
the
allottees
for
some
of
those
roadworks.
that
he'd
fail
to
pay
interest
on
certain
sums
or
insufficient
interest
and
finally
that
he
had
exacted
excessive
administrative
charges
of
being
cleared
that
the
secretary's
entitled
to
make
a
charge
for
his
management
of
the
timber
but
the
allottees
claimed
the
actual
charges
were
excessive.
in
all
of
these
respects
of
course,
the
allottees
claimed
money
damages.
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
case
proceeded
for
some
years
in
the
court
of
claims
before
the
united
states
interposed
the
defense
which
is
presently
before
this
court.
that
defense,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
premised
on
the
notion
that
these
claims
were
monetary
relief
against
the
united
states
in
respect
of
its
management
of
the
timber,
did
not
lie
under
the
tucker
act
or
under
its
counterpart
section
1505
of
the
judicial
code,
in
the
court
of
claims
or
indeed
in
any
other
court.
that
defense
was
no
doubt
accounted
by
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
testan
in
1976.
at
all
events,
when
the
motion
came
before
the
court
of
claims,
that
court
overruled
it
holding
that
applying
the
rationale
of
testan
and
its
own
decisions,
the
united
states
here
through
its
agent,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
had
violated
statutory
duties
which
fairly
mandated
compensation
in
damages
under
the
tucker
act
or
under
section
1505
against
the
united
states.
it
is
that
ruling
against
which
we
complain.
the
case
is
primarily
one
under
the
tucker
act,
section
1491
of
the
judicial
code.
much
is
made
of
the
companion
provision
as
we
call
it,
section
1505,
which
pertains
however,
only
to
the
claims
of
indian
tribes
or
identifiable
groups.
here
the
great
majority
of
the
plaintiffs
or
individual
allottees
who
cannot,
whenever
you
make
any
claim,
except
under
the
tucker
act
itself.
and
indeed
the
court
of
claims
did
not
suggest
otherwise.
1505
was
in
the
case,
in
view
of
the
court
of
claims
simply
because
there
is
a
small
tribal
claim.
at
all
events,
as
we've
elaborated
in
our
brief,
the
two
statutory
provisions
are
entirely
quite
extensive.
1505
allows
no
more
monetary
relief
than
does
the
tucker
act,
itself.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
a
case
based
entirely
on
an
act
of
congress
within
the
terminology
of
the
tucker
act,
we
view
those
questions
as
the
same,
analytically
different,
but
in
practice,
the
same.
and
may
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
analytically,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
you're
right.
there
are
two
questions.
we
placed
our
entire
emphasis
on
the
first
of
those
of
questions
that
is,
did
congress
in
the
general
allotment
act
primarily
relied
on
and
entirely
relied
by
the
court
of
claims,
impliedly
or
expressly
create
a
right
of
action
in
money
damages?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
against
the
united
states,
when
a
--
an
alleged
breach
of
trust
duty
is
found.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
so,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
our
disagreement
is
with
the
ease
with
which
they
find
such
a
relaxation
of
the
rule.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
some
difficulty
reconciling
my
answer
with
to
look
for
words
of
the
test
in
opinion.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
so
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
will
--
i
have
to
--
i
have
to
read
the
testan
or
perhaps
less
strictly
than
its
words
say.
testan
says
that
the
tucker
act
is
no
more
than
a
jurisdictional
statute.
if
by
that
is
meant,
the
court
which
will
hear
such
a
claim,
i
have
to
suggest
that
that
language
is
too
narrow
for
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
tucker
when
one
looks
at
its
original
language
and
when
one
reads
the
long
list
of
cases
in
this
court
must
in
some
sense
be
viewed
as
a
waiver
of
sovereign
of
immunity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
in
a
contract
case,
it's
set
that
the
tucker
act,
it
waives
a
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states.
it
can't
be
the
government
contractor
who
has
no
such
power.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
my
answer
is
--
is
the
opposite.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
one
does
approach
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
precisely,
because
of
the
tucker
act
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
some
sense,
one
must
construe
it
narrowly.
and
because
the
very
same
considerations
go
to
determining
whether
or
not,
the
united
states
has
made
itself
liable
in
damages
as
the
question
whether
the
united
states
has
opened
itself
to
suit
in
anyway.
i
would
put
it
in
this
way,
if
i
may.
that
is
a
presumption
against
monetary
liability
of
the
government.
that
presumption
derives
from
the
principle
of
sovereign
immunity
from
all
suits.
but
the
principle
of
sovereign
immunity
--
the
core
of
it
is
liability
in
--
to
a
judgment
which
will
expand
itself
against
the
federal
treasury
or
against
the
federal
land.
indeed,
there
are
suggestions
that
that's
all
it's
left
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so.
i
would
have
said
that
mr.
justice
white,
even
before
the
amendment
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so.
and
of
course,
it's
not
novel
notion
that
the
united
states
and
its
offices
open
themselves
up
to
actions
for
prospective
relief
and
hold
the
bar
to
accountability
in
money
damages.
one
need
only
think
of
the
hundreds
of
cases
in
which
courts
review
the
action
of
administrators
without
there
being
any
sovereign
immunity
bar
and
courts
do
direct
that
different
action
be
taken
in
the
future,
whether
it's
matter
of
--
of
the
fda,
withholding
improperly
permission
to
market
a
new
drug
or
any
other
example,
one
can
think
of.
the
department
of
interior
making
an
error
in
surveying
land,
those
are
matters
which
are
correctible
by
courts
for
the
future.
and
indeed,
to
some
extent
perhaps
retroactively,
but
which
do
not
give
rise
to
liability
and
damages
against
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it's
right
that
if
one
finds
a
statutory
duty
which
clearly
permits
recovering
damages
for
breach,
the
function
of
the
tucker
act
in
such
a
case
is
to
permit
you
to
join
the
united
states
in
name.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so.
and
that
to
--
to
come
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
court
--
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
one
must
say
that
the
tradition
that
the
remedy
for
breach
of
contract
is
money,
is
the
source
of
the
obligation
of
the
united
states,
like
any
other
contractor
when
breaching
a
contract
to
pay.
the
ability
to
sue
the
united
states
is
granted
by
the
tucker
act
in
waiving
the
technical
objection
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
it
--
but
in
a
contract
case,
which
of
course
is
--
is
not
the
category
we're
concerned
with
today,
it
is
the
law
of
contracts
that
provides
the
remedy
in
damages.
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
isn't
a
reliance
here
on
the
law
of
trust
or
i
can
say
the
common
law
of
trust
because
it's
a
doctrine
of
equity
but
the
unwritten
law
of
trust
is
not
what
is
invoked
in
this
case.
and
indeed
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
is
very
plain
that
there
is
no
reliance
on
the
law
of
trust
generally
or
even
on
the
fiduciary
relationship
between
indians
in
the
united
states.
the
reliance
is
on
an
act
of
congress
and
specifically
on
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
when
--
when
reliance
is
placed
on
act
of
congress,
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
say
following
the
testan
that
one
must
find
in
that
act
of
congress,
a
provision
fairly
read
as
mandating
a
recovery
in
damages
against
the
government.
and
that
is
simply,
wholly
absent
with
respect
to
the
general
allotment
act.
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
the
origin
of
the
right
to
collect
damages
is
based
on
law
of
trust,
generally.
and
indeed,
one
might
have
a
question
why
the
law
of
trust
like
the
law
of
contract
isn't
--
doesn't
afford
the
same
remedy
under
the
tucker
act.
the
answer
must
be
that
whereas
the
tucker
act
lists
certain
categories,
it
does
not
list
law
of
trust
as
one
of
them.
it
lists
contracts.
it
lists
acts
of
congress.
it
lists
the
constitution.
it
lists
regulations,
but
not
the
law
of
trust.
and
it
expressly
excludes
the
law
of
torts.
now,
the
--
the
question
is
we've
seen
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
commentators
in
courts
have
pondered
over
that
last
clause
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
have
usually
answered
that
it
simply
cannot
be
read
literally.
for
if
it
were,
it
would
absolve
all
that
came
before.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
be
meaningless.
and
therefore
the
answer
given
usually
is
that
that
clause
cannot
be
read
as
it's
written,
but
must
be
deemed
to
mean
two
things.
first,
that
damages
may
be
recovered
even
though
unliquidated.
and
secondly,
that
recovery
in
tort
is
never
permitted.
and
that
the
clause
qualifies
all
that
comes
before.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
not
permitted
by
the
tucker
act.
and
indeed,
in
this
case,
the
court
of
claims
in
its
words,
skipped
over
that
last
clause
placing
no
reliance
on
it
and
the
plaintiffs
below
have
made
no
reliance
on
it.
they
did
flirt
with
either
one
stage,
but
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
they
have
abandoned
any
reliance
on
it.
coming
now
to
the
question
whether
the
statute
invoked
the
general
allotment
act
of
188,7
can
be
read
as
fairly
mandating
relief
of
damages,
we
think
the
answer
clear,
that
statute
contemplated
the
scheme
whereby
the
land
of
the
reservation
would
be
divided
among
the
indians
within
25
years
and
in
the
meantime,
the
united
states
was
simply
to
hold
title
in
trust
solely
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
state
taxation
it
being
a
legal
title
in
the
united
states
and
therefore,
exempt
from
state
taxation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would,
mr.
justice
white,
say
that
some
of
those
rules
do
apply
as
they
were
indeed
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
but,
mr.
justice
white,
to
that
extent
i
invoke
the
approach
followed
in
testan
that
is
that
one
requires
a
very
clear
indication
if
not
an
expressed
statement
in
the
act
of
congress
relied
on
that
the
remedy
for
its
breach
shall
be
damages.
where
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so.
the
sovereign
immunity
may
be
weighed
by
the
tucker
act,
but
the
remedy
and
the
right
must
post
originate
from
the
same
statute
relied
on.
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
certainly
true
mr.
justice
blackmun
whether
it
was
simply
overlooked
or
whether
it
was
thought
that
was
an
exceptional
case
in
that,
the
very
purpose
of
the
general
allotment
act
had
been
to
exempt
the
allotted
lands
from
state
taxes.
and
that
case
involved
the
question
whether
the
united
states
had
breached
its
duty
to
assure
that
exemption
from
state
taxes,
by
failing
to
or
by
paying
over
voluntarily
the
state
taxes.
they
might
there
have
been
a
clear
--
clearer
relation
between
the
breach
alleged
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
whereas
here,
we're
at
thorough
move
from
that
situation.
we
also
bid
that
in
mason,
the
view
could've
been
taken
that
we
were
paying
with
the
indians'
money,
the
taxes
which
arguably,
they
did
not
owe.
and
to
that
extent,
we
were
misappropriating
funds.
the
kind
of
activity
which
the
testan
opinion
recognizes
does
not
require
the
same
--
the
same
expressed
provision
in
the
statute.
the
purposes
of
the
general
allotment
act
make
it
clear
that
the
congress
of
1887,
which
wrote
that
statute,
would
never
regret
of
providing
that
the
united
states
shall
be
amenable
in
damages
when
it
mismanages
as
alleged
the
timber
on
those
lands.
it
is
too
remote
from
the
expectations
of
those
who
wrote
that
statute
to
indulge
any
such
idea
quite
beyond
the
fact
that
the
statute
doesn't
itself,
provide
for
any
expressed
remedy
as
to
breach
--

1887,
as
well.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
same
year.
well,
that
--
of
course,
the
tucker
act
was
a
sequel
to
earlier
legislation
which
had
much
the
same
effect
in
respect
to
the
liability
of
the
united
states
for
cases
found
they've
done
an
act
of
congress.
that
had
been
the
law
since
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
not
in
this
respect.
the
remedy
for
--
in
respect
of
a
claim
founded
on
act
of
congress
had
been
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
since
1855.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
--
it's
certainly
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not.
but
i
think
it
did
add
the
constitution.
and
i
think
it
did
also
add
the
last
clause
--
the
clause
your
honor,
mentioned
a
minute
ago.
and
it
did
in
--
in
other
respects
changed
the
procedure
for
collecting
judgments
which
were
previously
not
so
much
judgments
as
they
were
recommendations
to
congress
for
an
appropriation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
probably
both,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
grateful
to
your
honor.
i
don't
know
why
we
should
have
overlooked
that
argument,
but
does
seem
to
me
available
to
say
that
the
statute
itself
provided
its
own
remedy
clearly
not
one
in
damages
and
that
is
an
additional
reason
why
one
shouldn't
strain
and
define
here
a
different
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
remedy
of
course,
would
not
be
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
may
be
that
in
the
case
of
a
--
an
alienation
which
is
wholly
unauthorized
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
not
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
that
would
probably
money
wrongfully
retained
within
the
exception
noted
in
testan.
it
might
also
be
a
--
a
taking
within
the
just
compensation
clause.
in
both
cases,
it
would
be
recoverable
under
the
tucker
act
without
regard
to
the
reliance
on
act
of
congress.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
from
the
constitution
itself,
but
of
course,
the
tucker
act
does
imply.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
this
court
has
done
it,
precisely
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
just
compensation
clause
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
in
words,
it
says
that
when
the
property
of
a
private
citizen
is
taken
for
public
use
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
(voice
overlap)
just
compensation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
remedy
in
damages,
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
against
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
(inaudible)
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
simply
want
to
suggest
that
the
proposition
now
put
forward
is
a
novel
one.
in
one
respect
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
be
a
--
accolade
of
indian
cases,
but
we
know
from
the
cherry
case,
decided
by
the
same
court
subsequently.
that
this
notion,
that
there
is
immunability
to
damages
for
breach
of
trust
is
not
limited
to
indian
cases.
and
indeed,
why
should
it
be
here?
there
is
such
a
principle,
it
will
range
far
and
wide
and
we
invite
the
court
not
to
open
that
door
which,
if
it's
opened,
has
been
opened
since
1887
and
yet,
it
didn't
occur
to
anyone,
indian
or
not
indian
to
put
it
forward
until
at
the
earliest,
a
decade
ago.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
chief
justice,
it
happens,
but
it
is
unusual
to
discover
100
years
later
that
the
tucker
act,
if
they're
available,
has
and
open
to
individual
indians,
not
tribes
since
then,
has
now,
for
the
first
time,
provided
a
remedy
of
breach
of
trust
because
it
happens,
it
might
not
have,
that
the
allotment
in
this
case
was
under
the
general
allotment
act,
if
it
have
been
made
under
the
very
treaty
of
olympia
involved
in
this
case,
it
would
not
be
a
trust
allotment,
it
would
be
a
restricted
allotment.
and
there'd
be
no
technical
breach
of
trust.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
with
--
of
course,
my
first
answer
is
that
there
is
a
prospective
remedy
to
enjoin
the
continuation
of
the
breach
by
the
secretary
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
whoever
is
violating
the
statutory
duty
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
--
in
the
district
courts,
under
5
u.s.c.
702,
to
review
and
to
correct
the
action
of
the
administrator
in
violating
the
statute
whether
it's
called
trust
or
not,
is
mismanagement
of
the
forest
in
violation
of
--
of
the
statute.
that
remedy
is
plainly
a
veil
of
oath
and
certainly,
is
they,
with
the
amendment
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it
may
also
be
a
remedy
to
recoup
any
monies
wrongfully
exacted
or
wrongfully
retained
from
the
indian.
that
is
an
exception
which
the
court
recognized
in
testan
and
which
we
conceive
here
may
well
be
available
to
these
plaintiffs
in
respect
of
the
claims
that
the
administration
fees
charged
by
the
government
were
excessive.
to
that
extent,
it
would
be
a
wrongful
retention
or
exaction
which
may
be
recouped.
but
it's
not
damages
in
the
usual
sense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
in
effect,
be
restitution.
