mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
a
preliminary
matter,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
recent
publication
of
the
whiskers
case.
the
citation
is
600
f.2d
1332.
the
whiskers
case
was
decided
by
tenth
circuit
and
that
court
agreed
with
the
court
of
claims
below.
we
sent
a
letter
to
the
clerk
of
this
court
asking
him
to
pass
the
citation
on
to
you.
he
said
he
had
no
authority
to
do
that
and
for
us
to
make
this
known
to
you
at
oral
argument.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
expressing
a
little
indignation
to
hear
a
justice
claiming
that
this
late
date
--
that
it
does
not
have
--
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
when
these
claims
were
filed
in
1971,
the
law
of
the
land
was
at
the
court
of
claims
did
have
jurisdiction
over
these
claims.
and
that's
what
the
court
of
claims
initially
held
in
the
klamath
case,
five
years
before
we
filed
these
claims
and
in
the
fields
case,
a
year
and
half
before
we
filed
these
claims.
in
capoeman,
involving
one
of
these
very
plaintiffs,
six
months
before
we
filed
these
claims,
the
court
of
claims
held
it
had
jurisdiction
under
1491.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
why
did
the
government
wait
so
long
to
spot
this
apparent
lack?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no
doubt.
we
had
gone
through
an
enormous
amount
of
litigation.
well
past
the
time
when
ordinarily
a
litigant
should
raise
a
point
of
--
of
jurisdiction,
if
he
has
one.
we
had
had
--
had
six
years
of
discovery.
we
had
three
fully
briefed,
reported
decisions
of
the
court
of
claims.
we
had
26,000
pages
of
exhibits
developed
and
handed
over
to
the
government.
we
had
a
three-week
trial.
after
the
trial
is
when
the
government
for
the
first
time,
raised
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
up
until
that
point,
the
law
of
the
land
was
settled.
that's
why
they
didn't
raise
the
issue
in
the
mason
case.
no
one
questioned
jurisdiction
at
that
late
date.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
not
saying
that
this
court
cannot
entertain
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
i'm
only
pointing
out
the
enormous
cost
and
inconvenience
to
us
of
having
delayed
so
long
while
case
after
case,
a
total
of
i
believe
nine
cases
went
by
--
with
jurisdiction
being
upheld
in
each
one
until
finally
they
--
and
though,
in
the
wake
of
the
testan
case,
saw
that
there
might
be
argument
to
be
made
in
this
case.
and
they
raised
it.
we
don't
say
they
can't
raise
it.
in
the
mason
case,
it
wasn't
just
the
court
of
claims
that
helped
give
the
bar
the
feeling
that
the
law
was
settled,
it
was
this
court.
in
the
mason
case
jurisdiction
was
invoked
under
1491.
it
was
not
seriously
challenged
by
the
government
below.
they
did
raise
a
question,
but
the
court
of
claims
held
it
had
jurisdiction.
the
issue
was
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no.
the
plaintiff
was
an
individual
in
the
mason
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
correct.
this
court
adjudicated
the
mason
case
on
the
merits
and
it
noted
on
footnote
5
that
the
suit
was
brought
under
28
u.s.c.
1491
which
gives
the
court
jurisdiction
and
to
render
judgment
upon
claims
against
the
united
states
and
so
forth.
now,
this
certainly
tells
me
ordinary
observer
that
well,
here's
a
case
that's
been
to
the
supreme
and
they
had
no
problem
with
it.
and
then
in
the
text
of
the
mason
case
mr.
justice
marshall
wrote
on
page
398,
“there
is
no
doubt
that
the
united
states
serves
in
fiduciary
capacity
with
respect
to
these
indians.
and
that
as
such,
it
is
duty-bound
to
exercise
great
care
in
administering
its
trust,
duty-bound.”
now,
at
the
time
that
the
court
below
decided
in
our
favor
that
there
was
jurisdiction
under
1491
and
1505,
1491
of
course
is
the
tucker
act.
1505
is
the
extension
of
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
for
future
cases.
i'm
coming
to
the
question
of
individual
versus
group
claims.
but
at
the
time
the
court
below
decided
our
case,
there
were
two
parallel
lines
of
cases
in
existence
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
the
klamath
and
the
mason
cases
were
one
line.
they
define
jurisdiction
under
1491
and
1505
for
indian
plaintiffs
and
the
other
line
was
the
testan
case
decided
by
this
court
and
the
eastport
case
decided
by
the
court
of
claims
in
1967.
eastport
is
the
court
that
wrote
the
fairly
mandating
compensation
test
which
this
court
adopted
in
the
testan
case.
and
neither
testan
nor
eastport
of
course,
was
an
indian
case.
the
klamath/mason
line
of
cases
specifically
upheld
jurisdiction
in
cases
like
ours.
and
test
port
--
eastport
line
was
an
open
question
in
cases
like
ours,
with
the
department
of
justice
saying
below
that
testan/eastport
meant
there
was
no
jurisdiction
even
in
an
indian
case
and
we
of
course,
arguing
the
contrary.
the
court
of
claims
en
banc
with
every
single
judge
concurring,
including
i
might
add
justice
or
judge
bennett,
who
had
dissented
in
the
testan
case
and
had
been
upheld
by
this
court.
when
it
reversed
the
testan
case,
all
agreed
that
the
testan/eastport
line
of
cases
was
entirely
in
harmony
with
the
klamath/mason
line
of
cases
and
under
both
lines,
the
court
had
jurisdiction.
let's
look
at
the
testan
case
now.
not
--
first
and
foremost,
testan
was
not
an
indian
case,
indian
cases
are
special
as
this
court
has
held
time
after
time.
there
are
special
canons
of
construction
that
apply
in
indian
cases.
there
is
the
knowledge
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
it
did
not
speak
to
that
question.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
there
is
the
underlying
knowledge
that
the
land
of
the
united
states
originally
belonged
to
the
indians.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
and
we
argue
the
rule
of
construction
which
is
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
justice
brennan,
i
--
i
assume
that
we
can
urge
any
ground
that
we
urge
below
in
support
of
affirmance
of
the
court
of
claims.
of
course,
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
it's
of
course,
a
rule
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
whether
to
listen
to
such
an
argument
if
the
court
of
claims
did
not
address
it.
but
it
is
a
fact
of
the
case
that
this
is
an
indian
case.
in
the
second
place,
also
important
is
the
fact
that
the
testan
case
did
not
involve
a
trust.
it's
instructive
i
think,
to
consider
that
kind
of
claim
that
testan
and
eastport
involved.
testan
involved
the
claim
of
a
government
employee
that
he
was
entitled
to
next
higher
rate
and
he
should
be
paid
for
that.
and
he
sued
for
damages
for
the
pay
--
back
pay,
for
the
next
higher
position
which
he
said
he
should've
had.
the
eastport
case
involved
someone
who
was
disappointed
with
the
ruling
of
the
shipping
board
which
failed
to
get
him
a
license,
to
enable
him
to
--
to
sell
a
ship
in
foreign
commerce,
which
he
had
wanted.
both
of
these
cases
involve
governmental
discretion
and
complex
governmental
decisions.
neither
involves
any
indication
by
congress
that
--
of
any
intention
that
there
would
be
a
right
to
recover
damages
with
that
kind
of
case.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
specific
trust
relationship
established
by
congress
in
the
general
allotment
act.
and
i
would
like
to
refresh
ourselves
on
the
language
of
that
act,
the
part
that's
relevant
here.
25
u.s.c.
348
which
was
passed
in
1887
says,
“the
united
states
does
and
will
hold
the
land
thus
allotted
for
the
period
of
25
years
in
trust
for
the
sole
use
and
benefit
of
the
indian
to
whom
such
allotment
shall
have
been
made
or
in
case
of
his
decease,
of
his
heirs,
according
to
the
laws
of
the
state
or
territory
where
such
land
is
located.
and
that
at
the
expiration
of
such
period,
the
united
states
will
convey
the
same
by
patent
to
the
said
indian
or
his
heirs
as
aforesaid
in
fee,
discharged
of
said
trust
and
free
of
all
of
charges
or
encumbrances
whatsoever.”
in
the
capoeman
case
this
court
held
that
that
language
created
a
trust
that
had
an
important
purpose
of
bringing
the
indian
to
a
state
of
competency.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
general
allotment
act?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no.
neither
do
most
contracts,
your
honor.
and
yet
it's
implied
when
a
duty
imposed
by
contract
has
been
breached,
there's
a
duty
to
respond
in
damages.
and
we
say
the
same
applies
in
a
breach
of
trust
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
could
not
see
when
you
were
in
dialogue
with
government
counsel.
i
could
not
see
the
existence
of
a
remedy
there,
but
these
contracts
for
timber
are
in
fact,
authorized
by
statute.
the
1910
statute
specifically
authorize
the
secretary
to
make
them,
to
sell
the
timber
or
to
approve
--
technically
to
approve
the
sale
by
the
allottee.
therefore,
this
--
the
1910
act
certainly
superseded
the
general
allotment
act's
ban
on
any
contract.
but
to
pick
up
with
the
capoeman
case
again,
in
that
case
you
held
that
the
language
of
the
general
allotment
act
created
an
undertaking
to
hold
whole
for
the
indian
his
allotment.
and
that
it
could
not
be
diminished
by
taxes
during
the
trust
period.
and
i
would
ask
you,
if
you
hold
that
the
trust
allotment
cannot
be
diminished
by
taxes
during
the
trust
period,
does
it
not
follow
that
it
should
not
be
diminished
by
waste
by
the
trustee
during
the
trust
period?
the
intent
of
congress
certainly
had
to
be
the
same
in
both
cases
that
would
diminish
the
value
of
the
allotment.
and
the
government
has
argued
that
the
general
allotment
act
did
not
contemplate
a
complex
timber
management
operation.
perhaps
it
did
not.
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that
because
the
only
question
here
is
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
and
the
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
trust.
the
scope
of
that
trust
whether
it
be
broad
or
narrow,
remains
for
further
litigation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
it
might.
but
the
1910
act
expanded
the
general
allotment
act
by
permitting
timber
sales.
and
that's
what
we
have
here,
timber
sales.
we
have
congressionally
authorized
timber
sales
done
under
a
trust
arrangement
created
by
the
general
allotment
act.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that's
right.
we
do
not
have
to
get
into
that
because
the
only
question
today
is
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
for
breach
of
trust.
it
is
not
how
wide
or
narrow
the
general
allotment
act
trust
is.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i'm
--
i'm
citing
the
1910
act
to
you
to
show
that
when
the
question
does
come
up
of
how
wide
the
trust
obligation
is,
the
1910
act
will
help
to
find
that.
so
indeed,
will
the
1934
act,
which
instructs
the
secretary
to
manage
the
timber
on
a
sustained-yield
basis,
which
he
failed
to
do.
there
are
many
acts,
all
cited
in
our
brief,
which
define
the
duties
of
the
trustee
under
the
trust
relationship,
but
those
justice
agrees
with
these.justice
says
in
its
brief
as
we
do,
that
this
question
is
not
before
you
now.
the
scope
of
the
trust
is
not
before
you.
if
the
general
allotment
act
gave
only
one
or
imposed
only
one
duty
on
the
united
states
after
litigation,
we'd
suppose
we
were
to
find
that
out,
still
the
question
is
whether
we
could
sue
on
the
--
on
the
breach
of
that
duty
for
damages.
we
say,
sure
we
can
for
by
analogy
to
the
contract,
by
the
legislative
history
which
i'm
going
get
to
in
minute.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
perhaps,
that
would
govern
to
the
exclusion
of
an
action
for
damages.
you
have
also
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
they
have
to
do
with
the
way
the
conveyance
of
the
timber
was
carried
out.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
the
contract
is
the
matrix
in
which
these
breaches
of
trust
occurred.
we
don't
rely
on
any
breach
of
contract,
certainly.
we
rely
on
breach
of
trust
which
occurred
in
the
context
of
a
contract.
the
contract
i
guess
you
might
say
is
background.
another
thing
you
have
to
consider
is
the
very
fact
that
these
timbered
allotments
were
made
at
all.
normally,
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases
of
indian
allotments,
they're
farmland.
and
the
indians
are
expected
to
raise
corn
or
--
or
cattle.
in
those
cases,
the
indian
does
the
work
and
the
government
just
helps
him
and
gives
seed
and
supervises
his
labor.
but
when
the
government
gave
2400
indians
80
acres
of
timber
each,
what
are
they
going
to
do?
you
can't
manage
80
acres
of
land.
an
individual
indian
can't.
for
one
thing,
you
only
can
harvest
it
once
in
a
lifetime.
and
when
you
do,
you're
going
to
need
equipment
that
most
people
don't
have
and
especially
an
indian.
for
another
thing
80
acres
is
hopelessly
small
as
a
--
an
area
of
timber
that
can
be
managed
particularly
if
it's
located
in
the
middle
of
a
large
forest.
if
it
were
an
isolated
woodland,
there
are
techniques
for
management
of
that.
this
is
in
the
middle
of
a
dense
forest,
one
of
the
densest
forests
in
the
united
states.
the
very
allotment
of
those
allotments
--
the
very
act
of
making
those
allotments
should
have
made
clear
that
the
trust
was
going
to
have
to
involve
some
management
of
timber,
because
the
indian
could
not
possibly
do
that
himself.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
are
allottees
or
successors
of
allottees,
who
have
a
claim
that
arose
while
the
land
was
in
trust
status,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no.
that's
correct.
however,
we
do
rely
on
1505
as
a
second
string
to
our
bow,
a
point
i'm
coming
to.
i
want
while
i'm
still
on
the
question
of
what
actually
happened
here?
what
is
the
--
for
practical
purposes,
what
really
went
on
here?
i
also
want
to
say
this.
that
the
indians
understandably
took
no
part
in
the
management
of
this
forest
even
though
they
were
the
owners
of
it
by
the
small
parcel,
they
took
no
part
in
its
management.
the
secretary
had
a
large
office
located,
one
of
them
in
portland,
one
of
them
in
washington
dc
and
another
one
in
later
everett,
washington.
they
decided
when
the
timber
was
to
be
sold.
when
they
decided
that,
they
would
go
visit
the
indian
or
communicate
with
him
and
have
him
come
in
and
sign
a
power
of
attorney.
that
authorized
the
secretary
to
do
all
things
necessary
to
manage
and
sell
that
timber.
the
government
then
would
put
out
invitation
for
bids.
the
government
would
let
the
contract.
when
the
contract
was
let,
the
government
would
supervise
the
contractor.
it
had
inspectors
in
the
field
and
inspected
the
logging.
they
saw
to
the
proper
scaling
of
the
timber.
they
saw
to
the
collection
of
money,
security
deposits
from
the
loggers,
they
collected
the
money,
they
deducted
their
10%
fee
and
they
credited
the
balance
to
the
allottees.
the
--
all
the
allottee
had
to
do
after
he
signed
the
power
of
attorney
was
open
the
envelope
with
the
check.
that's
all
he
had
to
do
with
a
very
complex
management
scheme
involving
hundreds
of
employees
of
the
interior
department.
this
clearly
distinguishes
our
case
from
the
background
of
either
testan
or
eastport.
we
don't
say
of
course
that
the
rules
of
those
cases
don't
apply.
they
do
of
course.
the
eastport/testan
rule
says
“that
when
you
sue
the
government
for
damages,
you
got
to
find
outside
the
tucker
act,
some
statute
that
gives
you
a
right
to
sue
for
damages.”
justice
says
this
has
to
be
expressed.
i
think
i
heard
during
the
oral
argument
a
retreat
from
that.
and
it
may
as
well
be,
because
the
testan
case
--
when
it
comes
to
testan's
own
conclusion,
it
picks
up
the
eastport
conclusion,
which
is
in
our
brief
on
page
13
which
i
would
like
quote
for
us.
this
is
this
court
laying
down
the
rule,
“entitlement
to
money
damages
depends
upon
whether
any
federal
statute,
‘can
fairly
be
interpreted
as
mandating
compensation
by
the
federal
government,
for
the
damage
sustained,'
citing
eastport.
in
continuing,
we
are
not
ready
to
tamper
with
these
established
principles.”
well,
the
eastport
case
that
you
approved
of
course
was
a
rule
laid
down
by
the
very
court
and
including
some
of
the
very
judges
that
have
said
that
we,
in
our
case,
have
jurisdiction.
so
the
question
is
whether
the
language
of
the
general
allotment
act
which
is
to
say
a
language
establishing
a
trust
can
be
fairly
mandating
as
saying
that
you
have
a
right
of
action
for
damages.
the
court
of
claims
said,
yes.
the
whiskers
case
has
said,
yes.
two
district
courts
in
california
have
said,
yes.
they're
cited
in
our
brief.
you
have
said,
yes,
in
case
that
we
don't
find
substantially
similar
or
dissimilar.
in
jacobs
v.
united
states,
which
is
a
just
compensation
case,
you
upheld
jurisdiction
under
a
fifth
amendment
taking
claim
even
though
the
constitution
is
silent
as
to
any
right
to
sue
for
damages.
you've
said
this
was
part
of
the
self-executing
aspect
of
the
constitution.
well,
isn't
this
also
true
of
a
trust?
if
a
trustee
breaches
his
trust,
isn't
it
an
inherent
part
of
that
relationship
that
he
respond
in
damages?
the
united
states
v.
wickersham
which
was
another
government
employee
case.
unlike
testan,
he
already
had
his
job
and
he
was
illegally
fired
from
it.
yet,
he
was
held
to
have
an
implied
right
to
go
to
court
and
sue
for
damages
for
the
back
pay
during
the
period
he'd
been
laid
off
illegally,
because
you
said
that
this
was
a
suit
for
denial
of
emoluments
of
a
civil
service
position
and
that
was
presumably
an
implied,
fairly
mandated
cause
of
action.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
by
holding
implied
rights
of
action
in
the
constitution?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
they
do.
the
justice
department
did
not
raise
the
point
and
we
decided
in
view
of
the
enormous
number
of
points
to
raise,
not
to
raise
it
ourselves.
but
we
did
think
of
that
they
helped
us.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
the
jacobs
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
we
did
rely
on
that.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
we
also
didn't
argue
the
cort
case,
c.
o.
r.
t.
because
we
thought
our
case
was
--
raise
sharper
issues.
the
cort
case
was
vaguer,
less
tied
down,
less
nailed
down,
had
less
square
corners
in
our
case.
we
have
a
trust
agreement
here.
and
we
think
therefore,
that
the
very
existence
of
that
trust
confers
a
right
of
action
for
damages.otherwise,
what
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no.
it
is
a
trust
to
bringing
in
this
to
a
state
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
in
the
case
of
farmland,
the
indian
does
have
control
of
the
property.
in
the
case
of
timberland,
he
does
not.
these
allottees
don't
even
know
where
their
lands
are.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
they
tried,
your
honor,
in
1941.
and
the
court
threw
them
out.
that
was
the
eastman
case.
it
was
a
suit
for
injunction
to
permit
the
indians
to
run
the
timberland
the
way
they
wanted
to
and
the
court
said,
“why,
nonsense.”
the
secretary
would
be
foolish
if
he
let
the
indians
run
their
own
allotments.
it'd
be
--
it'd
be
a
madhouse
in
the
forest.
and
they
threw
them
out
of
the
grounds
that
the
secretary
had
to
manage
this
forest
as
a
single
unit.
they
tried
the
injunction
route
and
they
were
thrown
out.
now
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
no,
that's
true.
now,
justice
agrees
that
some
of
our
claims
are
within
the
tucker
act.
claims
for
money
improperly
withheld.
why
is
land
held
by
the
government
with
an
obligation
to
turn
it
over
at
the
end
of
the
trust
period
any
different
than
money
held?
if
this
court
here
--
if
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
for
a
money
claim,
then
why
not
for
a
claim
--
a
land
claim
--
a
land
for
return
of
the
money
originally
given
to
the
trustee?
contract,
suppose
there
were
a
contract
between
these
indians
and
the
government
and
the
obligation
of
the
government
under
that
contract
was
to
competently
manage
these
forestlands,
would
anyone
question
that
the
court
of
claims
had
jurisdiction
over
such
a
claim?
i
don't
think
so.
what
about
the
fact
that
the
indians
have
paid
fees
in
this
case?
the
united
states
collects
up
to
a
10%
fee
to
pay
it
for
its
administrative
services.
is
that
not
an
implied
contract
if
the
services
are
not
properly
performed
to
be
paid
to
make
the
trust
property
hold?
the
interior
department
agrees
with
us.
now,
for
a
good
reason,
when
the
indian
claims
commission
act
was
passed,
they
testified
that
they
wanted
to
be
accountable
in
order
to
make
the
government
employees
have
an
incentive
to
do
a
proper
job
under
the
trust's
responsibility.
they
so
testified
and
the
language
is
quoted
in
our
brief.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
that
is
so.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
have
to
confess
considerable
confusion
over
the
question
of
whatever
sovereign
immunity
and
creation
of
a
cause
of
action
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
that's
not
what
this
court
said
in
testan.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
your
honor,
i
have
a
second
argument
that
is
just
as
solid
as
the
first.
and
i
must
turn
my
attention
--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--
to
it
now,
and
that
is
the
legislative
history.
you
cannot
read
this
legislative
history
of
1505
without
concluding
that
congress
intended
tribes
and
identifiable
groups
to
have
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
for
breach
of
trust.
you
cannot
conclude
otherwise.
the
question
is
whether
our
plaintiffs
fit
within
the
definition
of
tribe
or
identifiable
group.
tribe,
we
have
the
quinault
tribe
and
as
to
their
4000
acres,
clearly
they're
within
that.
whether
you
call
it
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
or
creation
of
a
cause
of
action,
that
legislative
history
did
both
and
no
question
about
that.
as
to
identifiable
group,
these
1465
plaintiffs
are
an
identifiable
group.
they
were
so
held
by
the
court
of
claims.
while
they
were
held
to
be
a
class
by
the
court
of
claims,
the
court
of
claims,
it
has
rulings
that
we
think
would
make
them
agree
that
this
is
an
identifiable
group.
if,
however,
you
do
not
agree
that
they're
an
identifiable
group,
then
the
doctrine
of
in
pari
materia
must
lead
you
to
conclude
that
1491
has
to
be
construed
the
same
way
as
1505.
that
is
what
the
court
of
claims
held
in
the
hiba
case.
it
was
cited
in
our
brief
and
that
is
a
case
upon
which
we
would
rely,
if
we
got
to
that
point.
thank
you.
