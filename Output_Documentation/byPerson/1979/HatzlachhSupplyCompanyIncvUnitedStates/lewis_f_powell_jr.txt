mr.
lewin,
perhaps
this,
i
guess
it
was
suggested
by
my
brother
rehnquist's
question,
but
if
there
were
no
2680(c)
as
it's
been
construed
by
the
court
of
claims,
you'd
still
have,
there'd
still
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
of
claims
had
jurisdiction
of
this
lawsuit,
would
there
not?
you'd
say
that
perhaps
the
answer
is
pretty
clear,
but
in
any
event,
there
would
be
a
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
was
brought
under
1491,
wasn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
as
an
implied
contract
claim,
not
as
a
constitutional
claim?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
not
founded
upon
an
act
of
congress?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
there
would
still
remain
questions
to
which
you
say
the
answers
are
reasonably
clear,
but
in
any
event,
there
would
be
questions
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
as
to
the,
to
whether
or
not
this
law-suit
fits
under
the
jurisdictional
language
of
23
usc
1491,
would
there
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
jones,
on
the
question
of
negligence
under
such
an
action,
would
the
mere
failure
to
return
be
sufficient
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
negligence?
say
all
they
know
is
that
the
goods
were
seized
and
not
returned.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
supposing
he
proved
title
but
he
doesn't
know
what
happened
to
them.
would
that
be
enough
to
prove
negligence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
res
ipsa
locutor?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
an
action
against
the
individual
officer,
isn't
it,
as
opposed
to
against
the
united
states?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
traditional
action?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
it's
a
presumption
that
the
individual
he
happens
to
name
as
the
defendant
in
the
complaint
has
been
guilty
of
negligence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
one
cannot
tell
from
the
complaint
whether
the
claim
is
--
all
we
know
is
that
the
goods
disappeared,
allegedly,
and
it
could
have
been
that
they
were
negligently
lost
or
it
could
have
been
that
they
were
negligently
stolen,
or
it
could
have
been
that
they
were
converted.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
deliberately
converted.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
far
as
the
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
although
if
somebody
said
there
was
a
bailment
contract
here,
you
wouldn't
require
some
express
provision
in
the
contract,
you
would
just
say
everybody
knows
a
contract
that
is
breached
calls
for
damages.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
claims
there
is
a
contract.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
it
is
similar
to
the
case
we
heard
argued
on
monday
involving
the
--
in
which
the
government
was
also
involved,
involving
the
general
allotment
act
and
the
duty
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
timber?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
is
this
part
of
your
argument
similar
to
the
government's
argument
in
that
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that
is
the
same
thing,
i
think.
the
court
of
claims
want
the
other
way.
of
course,
it
didn't
have
2680(c)
to
bother
with.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
but
the
claim
was
a
trust.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
was
mitchell.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
perhaps
my
question
was
a
little
wide
of
the
mark
and
maybe
also
unfair,
but
that
case
was
argued
monday
and
it
is
over.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
it
is
a
constitutional
duty
to
reimburse,
to
pay
for
it.
