mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
the
tucker
act
are
not
the
only
statutes
that
are
relevant
in
this
case,
and
they
are
not
the
only
remedies
that
could
be
available
in
this
context.
it
is
our
position
that
petitioner
brought
his
claim
on
the
wrong
theory
and
in
the
wrong
form.
petitioner
has
conceded
in
his
reply
brief
that
the
very
claim
that
he
seeks
to
raise
as
a
contract
claim
under
the
tucker
act
traditionally
has
been
brought
as
a
tort
action
against
customs
officers
individually
in
federal
district
court.
for
over
200
years
it
has
been
settled
at
common
law
that
a
customs
officer
may
be
sued
in
tort
for
the
negligent
performance
of
his
office,
and
in
particular
for
the
negligent
loss
of
goods
that
have
been
seized
for
forfeiture,
and
for
over
100
years,
the
united
states
has
consented
by
statute,
28
usc
2006,
to
pay
the
tort
judgment
entered
against
the
customs
officer,
so
long
as
the
seizure
was
made
with
probable
cause,
as
it
surely
was
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
you'd
have
to
show
title
to
the
goods.
he'd
have
to
prove
that
they
weren't
forfeit,
if
that
was
an
open
issue.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
it
would
be
enough
to
create
a
presumption
of
negligence,
probably
on
a
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--
res
ipsa
locutor
theory.
it
may
depend
on
the
context
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
individual
that
he
happens
to
name
has
to
be
the
customs
officer,
and
the
presumption
would
be
that
if
the
goods
were
lost,
without
explanation,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
customs
officer
to
show
that
he
exercised
due
diligence
and
that
the
goods
--
that
he
was
at
fault
for
the
loss
of
the
goods.
here
he
was
not
at
fault.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
none
of
those
would
create
a
claim
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
i
think
the
contract
remedy
would
be
broader
in
two
sense.
first
of
all,
the
common
law
negligence
remedy
against
the
collector,
he
never
has
to
pay
consequential
damages
for
the
goods,
the
detention
of
the
goods.
he
only
has
to
pay
the
value
of
the
goods
themselves
that
are
lost.
it
is
a
basic
principle
of
contractual
bailment
that
the
contractual
bailee
would
be
liable
for
all
damages
relating
to
the
loss
of
the
goods,
including
the
consequential
losses.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
think
that
he
would
have
to
prove
they
came
into
the
possession
of
the
customs
officer.
he
would
then
have
to
prove
that
they
were
lost
due
to
his
negligence.
but
the
unexplained
absence
would
create
the
presumption
of
negligence.
it
would
have
to
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
that
would
be
subject
to
proof.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
were
many
different
standards.
story,
in
the
treatise
that
we
both
cited,
specified
a
standard
for
quasi-bilees
of
the
kind
he
thought
the
customs
officers
were
and
he
said
that
their
responsibility
was
simply
what
i
have
described,
would
be
an
ordinary
negligence
responsibility.
well,
for
whatever,
reasons
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
am
not
certain
that
that
would
be
the
standard
for
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
didn't
study
bailments
in
my
--(laughter)petitioner
never
sought
to
invoke
this
traditional
statutory
tort
remedy
for
the
claimed
loss
of
his
goods.
instead,
he
sought
to
bring
his
tort
claim
as
a
contract
action
in
the
court
of
claims.
but
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
over
contracts
with
the
united
states
extends,
of
course,
only
to
consensual
agreements.
it
doesn't
encompass
tort
or
quasi-contractual
claims
where
by
fiction
of
law
a
promise
is
imputed
to
perform
a
legal
duty
without
regard
to
the
intent
of
the
parties.
well,
the
fundamental
defect
with
the
petitioner's
action
in
the
court
of
claims
is
that
the
traditional
duty
of
customs
officers
to
care
for
seized
goods
is
quite
plainly
imposed
by
law
and
not
by
any
agreement.
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
thomas
case
in
1872,
and
in
justice
story's
opinion
in
burke
v.
trevitt
in
1816,
the
duty
of
customs
officers
to
care
for
seized
goods
was
held
to
derive
from
their
official
obligation
to
perform
their
office
with
due
care
or
due
diligence.
it
was
not
derived
from
any
implied
contractual
undertaking
entered
into
at
the
time
of
seizure.
and
there
is
in
fact
nothing
at
all
contractual
or
consensual
about
the
seizure
of
goods
for
forfeiture.
as
justice
story
stated
in
his
commentaries,
there
is
no
voluntary
election
at
seizure.
the
goods
are
seized
by
justifiable
force
and
not
by
consent
or
agreement.
there
is
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
only
difference
is
that
the
person
who
brings
the
goods
into
the
port
under
a
false
declarations
is
engaging
in
white
collar
smuggling.
it
is
only
necessary
to
prove
that
the
goods
are
forfeit
to
show
that
the
false
declaration
was
made
negligently,
and
it
hasn't
been
disputed.
i
am
not
sure
it
was
disputed
in
the
petitioner's
opening
argument,
but
it
hasn't
been
disputed
before,
that
this
was
negligent
when
these
false
statements
were
negligent.t
hey
were
in
fact
concededly
made,
obvious
errors
were
conceded
and
no
explanation
was
given
other
than
that
we
were
negligent
in
making
those
obvious
mistakes.
well,
the
government's
interest
in
preventing
negligence
these
kind
of
unexplained
negligent
entries
into
the
country
is
just
as
important
as
its
interests
in
preventing
intentional
entries
into
the
country.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
think
that
the
result
would
be
the
same
for
any
kind
of
forfeiture.
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
decreed
the
forfeiture.
in
1592
it
decreed
that
forfeiture
for
if
you
were
negligent
false
statements.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
it
is
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--
it
is
under
19
u.s.c.
1618,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
can
upon
petition
remit
any
forfeiture
if
he
decides
that
the
violation
of
the
customs
laws
was
not
done
with
willful
fraud
or
there
are
other
mitigating
circumstances.
well,
as
i
understand
the
petitions
in
this
case,
it
appears
that
what
was
made
out
was
a
case
of
negligent
misstatement
and
not
willful
fraud,
so
the
secretary
determined
that
he
would
exact
only
a
$40,000
penalty
and
then
returned
the
remaining
goods
in
his
possession.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
the
goods
that
were
missing
in
this
case
were
missing
long
before
the
forfeiture
was
remitted.
i
also
think
i
should
point
out
that
our
brief
wasn't
sure
whether
petitioner
was
trying
to
say
that
their
remission
was
itself
a
contract,
and
so
we
brief
the
issue,
although
we
didn't
think
it
was
presented
in
the
case.
it
is
clear
to
me
from
petitioner's
reply
brief
that
they
don't
think
that
the
remission
is
a
separate
contract.
all
they
are
saying
is
that
it
evidences
the
intention
of
the
government
at
the
time
they
seized
the
goods.
well,
i
think
it
may
evidence
our
intention,
and
what
it
indicates
is
that
we
thought
the
goods
were
forfeited
but
we
decided
on
reflection
that
we
would
exact
a
lesser
penalty.
justice
story
described
customs
officers
as
quasi-bailees
of
seized
goods
because
the
duty
imposed
on
them
by
law
bears
only
some
analogy
to
the
duty
created
in
a
true
contractual
bailment.
in
a
contractual
bailment,
goods
come
into
the
possession
of
the
bailee
by
mutual
assent,
and
it
is
fundamental
that
the
contractual
bailee
cannot
dispute
the
title
of
the
bailor.
but
when
the
united
states
seizes
goods
for
forfeiture,
it
does
so
for
the
very
purpose
and
with
the
very
intent
of
disputing
title
and
a
seizure
is
accomplished
by
lawful
force
and
not
by
agreement.
well,
the
quasi-bailee
status
of
customs
officers
has
been
recognized
by
federal
statute
since
the
first
congress.
some
of
them
have
been
referred
to
--
1605,
19
u.s.c.
1605
directs
the
customs
officer
to
hold
the
goods
in
his
possession.
and
one
aspect
of
the
quasi-bailment
under
both
common
law
and
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
claim
wasn't
presented.
i
think
under
this
court's
reasoning
in
testan,
it
couldn't
be
sustained.
the
statute
doesn't
by
its
terms
purport
to
create
any
action
in
money
damages
against
the
united
states.
it
simply
says
to
the
collector
--
rather
the
customs
officer,
in
its
current
words,
to
hold
the
goods
while
the
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
okay.
that
is
2465.
that
provision
says
that
if
a
forfeiture
proceeding
is
brought
and
the
claimant
prevails
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding,
then
the
goods
must
be
returned.
that
is
what
the
law
would
require,
and
that
is
by
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
wouldn't
create
a
claim
against
the
united
states.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
you
trace
the
history
of
that
provision,
which
goes
back
to
the
first
congress
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
created
no
right
of
money
damages
against
the
united
states.
it
created
a
right
of
the
return
of
the
goods
and
that
right
is
enforceable
against
the
customs
officer.
he
has
the
duty
to
return
the
goods.
if
he
doesn't
return
the
goods,
then
the
injured
party
can
go
to
federal
district
court
to
sue
the
customs
officer
personally
in
negligence.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
it
would
have
to
come
close
to
--
much
closer
to
saying
that
than
what
it
does
say.
i
don't
think
it
would
have
to
use
those
talismatic
words,
but
it
should
come
much
closer.
as
the
statute
stands
now,
it
is
a
direction
for
the
disposition
of
the
property
and
there
are
other
alternative
remedies
for
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
tucker
act
creates
jurisdiction
for
claims
brought
under
the
contracts,
so
you
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
finding
a
source
of
authority
for
that.
but
the
tucker
act,
in
creating
jurisdiction
for
statutory
claims
doesn't
specify
what
kinds
of
claims
can
be
brought
under
the
statute.
this
court
has
grappled
with
that
and
did
s
on
monday.
i
don't
think
it
is
--
i
know
it
is
not
relevant
in
this
case
in
terms
of
deciding
the
case
because
the
petitioner
hasn't
claimed
that
he
has
any
right
against
the
united
states
under
the
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
he
claims
on
contract
which
is
by
definition
a
consensual
relationship
and,
as
i
have
already
discussed,
there
isn't
anything
consensual
about
the
origin
of
the
relationship
that
he
relies
on
which
is
the
seizure
of
the
goods.
but
petitioner
does
try
to
make
a
reliance
on
the
statute
that
you
referred
to,
and
the
way
he
uses
it
is
that
he
says
that
customs
officers
and
importers
are
aware
of
this
legal
duty
to
return
the
goods
in
some
circumstances
and
that
because
they
are
aware
of
that
legal
duty
there
is
a
tacit
understanding
or
contract
for
the
duty
to
be
performed.
well,
under
petitioner's
logic,
any
duty
imposed
by
law
on
federal
officers
could
be
said
to
create
a
contract
with
the
public
for
the
duty
to
be
performed.
for
example,
the
warden
of
a
prison
could
be
said
to
contract
to
release
a
prisoner
at
the
expiration
of
his
prison
term.
well,
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
reasoning
that
this
court
has
long
rejected
in
cases
holding
that
the
court
of
claims
lacks
jurisdiction
over
contracts
implied
in
law
where
a
promise
to
perform
a
legal
duty
is
imputed
simply
by
fiction
of
law.
in
fact,
the
court
of
claims
rejected
petitioner's
reasoning
under
the
very
statute
that
he
relies
on,
including
28
u.s.c.
2465,
holding
in
1868,
in
the
schmalz
case
that
a
general
law
cannot
imply
a
contract
with
a
citizen,
there
must
be
a
genuine
consensual
relationship.
well,
as
we
have
already
discussed,
the
court
of
claims
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
didn't
head
that
lead
into
your
sentence.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
is
not
similar
because
it
is
inverted.
here
he
is
claiming
he
has
a
contract
right
that
is
based
on
the
tacit
understanding
that
a
statutory
duty
will
be
performed,
whereas
in
mitchell
the
petitioner
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
mitchell
was
a
case
based
on
a
statute,
not
on
a
contract.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
was
a
claim
based
saying
that
a
statute
providing
for
a
particular
relationship
is
a
statute
that
creates
a
money
claim
against
the
united
states.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
a
court
of
claims
in
the
mitchell
case?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
am
not
aware
that
they
relied
on
that.
i
think
they
decide
a
very
broad
proposition
there
and
i
think
that
that
broad
proposition
shows
up
in
their
later
decisions
in
the
cherry
case,
the
broad
proposition
being
that
any
statute
that
mentions
or
impliedly
talks
about
a
trust
relationship
is
a
statute
that
requires
the
united
states
to
pay
money
damages
if
the
statute
is
breached.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
do
agree
with
petitioner
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
has
only
a
tangential
relevance
to
this
case.
in
fact,
our
dispute
with
petitioner
about
proper
construction
of
the
act
could
be
called
hypothetical.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
we
think
that
the
court
of
claims,
for
reasons
that
i
don't
know,
was
unaware
of
the
private
tort
action
that
has
always
been
available,
has
been
available
--
has
been
decided
as
recently
as
1974
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
was
not
called
to
the
attention
of
court
of
claims.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
we
don't
take
the
position
that
2680(c)
refers
to
contracts,
contract
claims.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
because
he
brought
it
under
a
contract
theory,
he
has
to
show
a
contract.
maybe
it
would
help
if
i
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
court
of
claims
remedy
if
need
be
for
this
kind
of
claim
negligent
loss
of
goods.
after
you
sue
the
private
customs
officers,
you
get
a
judgment
and
the
judgment,
if
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
seizure,
is
to
be
executed
against
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
rather
than
the
private
party.
well,
if
for
some
reason
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
refused
to
pay
that
judgment,
he
could
bring
the
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
judgment
presumably
--
i
think
he
could
--
claiming
that
he
had
a
statutory
right
for
the
judgment
to
be
paid.
the
statutory
right
would
be
28
u.s.c.
2006.
so
i
don't
want
to
say
there
is
no
remedy
--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
think
it
has
ever
been
necessary.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
treasury
has
always
paid.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
the
federal
tort
claims
act
has
a
limited
significance
in
this
case.
both
sides
have
agreed
that
congress
adopted
the
tort
claims
act
exception
for
customs
detentions
in
section
2680(c)
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
there
were
adequate
preexisting
remedies
for
persons
who
were
seized
--
whose
goods
are
seized
by
the
customs
officers.
there
is
an
argument
about
whether
the
language
of
2680(c)
requires
that
construction,
permits
it
or
doesn't.
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
it
certainly
permits
the
construction,
and
what
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
indicates
congress'
intent
to
cover
the
situation
where
there
is
a
private
remedy
under
28
u.s.c.
2006.
and
petitioner
concedes
that
the
traditional
preexisting
remedy
is
the
remedy
under
28
u.s.c.
2006
for
negligent
loss
of
goods.
section
2006
provides
only
a
limited
remedy
against
the
united
states.
the
united
states
pays
the
judgment
in
the
private
action
for
negligent
loss
of
goods
only
if
the
seizure
is
made
with
probable
cause,
and
petitioner
argues
that
the
remedy
is
no
limited
that
it
is
inadequate
and
thus
congress
didn't
mean
to
preserve
it
as
the
sole
remedy
for
the
loss
of
goods.
well,
the
remedy
in
section
2006
is
obviously
adequate
in
all
cases
where
the
goods
were
seized
for
probable
cause,
for
the
reason
i
just
mentioned.
the
judgment
in
those
cases
is
not
paid
by
the
customs
officer,
it
is
paid
by
the
united
states
treasury.
in
the
relatively
few
cases
where
a
seizure
is
made
without
probable
cause,
the
united
states
will
not
pay
the
judgment
but
the
customs
officer
then
remains
personally
liable.
indeed,
the
officer
is
liable
on
a
theory
of
conversion
for
consequential
damages
as
well
as
the
value
of
the
goods
themselves.
well,
that
retained
personal
liability
obviously
serves
the
government's
interests
in
preventing
misconduct
by
its
officers.
the
limitation
in
section
2006
seems
designed
to
advance
the
government's
interest
in
prohibiting
unlawful
seizures.
it
doesn't
make
the
entire
remedial
scheme
inadequate.
the
relevance
of
the
tort
claims
act
exception
and
the
history
of
the
act
to
this
case
to
us
seems
to
be
simply
that
it
evidences
congress'
intent
not
to
disturb
the
limited
preexisting
remedy
under
section
2006
by
assuming
a
general
tort
responsibility
for
customs
seizures.
as
the
court
of
claims
reasoned
in
this
case,
the
government
cannot,
as
petitioner
claims,
impliedly
assent
in
fact
to
a
contract
liability
for
acts
that
it
has
refused
by
law
to
be
responsible
for
in
tort.
or
stated
another
way,
the
specific
remedial
provision
in
28
u.s.c.
2006
should
control
over
the
more
general
provisions
of
either
the
federal
tort
claims
act
or
the
tucker
act,
and
i
think
that
was
essentially
the
reasoning
that
this
court
decided
the
stanzilero
case
on.
for
these
reasons,
we
think
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
