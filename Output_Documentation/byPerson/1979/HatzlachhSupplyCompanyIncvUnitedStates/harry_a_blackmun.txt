justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
say
it's
a
bailment
imposed
by
law,
rather
than
a
bailment
in
fact,
so
it
isn't
the
kind
of
a
bailment
contract
that's
subject
to
suit
in
a
court
of
claims?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
lewin,
i
suppose
that
if
the
court
of
claims
was
wrong
in
saying
that
2680(c)
provides
no
remedy,
let's
assume
that
when
you
don't
return
goods
back,
you
can
sue
the
united
states
under
the
court
of
claims
act.
if
you
negligently
lose
them.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
this
case
wouldn't
amount
to
a
whole
lot,
would
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
say
we've
granted
cert
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand,
because
this
means
that
the
united
states
intends
to
be
immune
generally?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
if
they
were
wrong
on
that,
say
they're
wrong
on
that,
it
wouldn't
change
their
position
that
this
is
not
an
implied
contract?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
wouldn't
change
the
united
states
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we've
granted
cert
on
this
conflict
on
(c)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
could
it
be
that
if
the
court
of
claims
was
wrong
on
the
tort
claims
act
on
2680,
could
it
be
that
there
could
be
a
tort
claim,
an
action
of
the
tort
claims
act,
and
also
an
action
in
the
court
or
claims,
or
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
couldn't
bring
a
tort
claim
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you've
got
two
shots
at
this
case,
one
if
you
win
on
2680,
you'll
win
in
any
event;
at
least
you
can
stay
in
court,
in
some
other
court,
and
if
you
win
on
the
other
and,
you
might
stay
in
the
court
of
claims
contract?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
time
has
run
out.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
at
least
as
i
learned
in
law
school,
that
was
the
standard
exacted
upon
a
gratuitous
bailee,
in
contrast
to
the
bailee
for
hire.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
a
mutual
benefit,
a
mutual
account.
a
gratuitous
bailee
is
the
bailee
is
the
slight
negligence
standard.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
defend
the
court
of
claims
reasoning
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
that
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
claims?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
don't
say
that
2680,
even
if
it
means
what
the
court
of
claims
thought
it
meant,
insulates
the
united
states
from
any
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
on
a
contract?
