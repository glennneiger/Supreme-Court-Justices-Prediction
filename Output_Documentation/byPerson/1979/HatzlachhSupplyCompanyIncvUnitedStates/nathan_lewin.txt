mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
claims
presents
the
question
whether
the
united
states
may
be
sued
as
a
party
to
an
implied
contract
of
bailment
when
goods
seized
by
the
customs
service
are
lost
while
in
the
custody
of
customs.
the
court
of
claims
granting
summary
judgment
for
the
united
states,
held
that
by
reason
of
a
provision
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
particularly
subsection
(c)
of
section
2680,
the
united
states
is
totally
immune
from
any
consequences
which
follow
--
and
here's
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
--
"the
detention
of
any
goods
or
merchandise
by
any
officer
of
customs
or
excise
or
any
other
law
enforcement
officer."
this
reading
of
section
2680(c)
conflicts
with
the
1958
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit
in
a
case
called
alliance
assurance
company
v.
united
states,
which
is
recorded
in
252
fed.
2d,
and
also
with
a
very
recent
construction
of
that
statute
by
the
9th
circuit.
and
this
court
has
now
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
that
conflict.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
quite
frankly
the
court
of
claims
did
not
consider
in
this
case
the
location
of
and
the
language
of
this
particular
subsection
as
compared
with
those
that
were
near
it,
nor
indeed
did
it
consider
the
legislative
history
of
section
2680(c),
which
we've
set
out
in
our
brief.
i
think
the
court
of
claims
was
quick,
maybe,
to
seize
on
the
language
of
2680(c)
and
to
view
it
as
applying
to
these
kinds
of
situations
because
it
viewed
that
subsection
as
granting
broad
protections
to
the
customs
service.
we
think
that
is
not
what
the
legislative
history
shows
about
subsection
(c)
and
we
think
that's
not
what
congress
intended.
it
did
not
intend
to
say
customs
service
is
immune
from
suits
against
it
as
for
example
the
tennessee
valley
authority
is
under
the
provision
of
2680,
the
last
subsection,
or
other
agencies
of
government,
the
military
service
or
others.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
was
a
detention;
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
of
course,
this
case
was
decided
on
summary
judgment.
all
the
facts
were
not
presented,
in
terms
of
the
history
of
how
this
property
came
into
the
possession
of
the
united
states
and
what
steps
led
up
to
the
notice
of
seizure.
an
interesting
fact
which
appears
just
from
the
record,
and
of
course
that
would
have
to
be
amplified,
if
there
ultimately
had
to
be
a
trial
on
this
question,
is
that
there
were
11
weeks
between
the
time
that
these
goods
came
into
the
united
states
and
until
a
notice
of
seizure
was
sent
out.
now,
the
notice
of
seizure,
of
course,
is
not
a
forfeiture,
contrary
i
think
to
implications
that
might
emerge
from
the
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general.
a
notice
of
seizure
in
the
customs
procedure,
ordinarily,
just
initiates
the
process.
it
says
to
the
importer,
"now,
look.
we
expect
you
now
to
proceed.
if
you
want
to
claim
that
there
should
not
be
a
forfeiture,
if
you
want
to
claim
that
there
are
circumstances
which
relieve
us
of
the
right
to
forfeit
these
goods,
file
a
petition,"
which
is
exactly
what
was
done.
but
in
this
case,
the
notice
of
seizure
didn't
immediately
even
follow
upon
the
arrival
of
the
goods
to
the
united
states.
the
goods
arrived.
let
me
just
go
through
those
facts
very
briefly.
the
goods
arrived
in
march
and
april
from
hamburg.
there
was
apparently
a
discrepancy
between
what
appeared
on
the
bills
of
lading,
with
regard
to
these
goods,
which
described
them
all
as
razor
blades,
although
in
a
corner
it
described
film,
and
the
invoices,
which
were
equally
available
to
customs
and
were
just
open
and
notorious.
the
invoices
specified
there
were
camera
supplies
and
film
and
things
of
that
kind.
the
importer,
upon
being
notified
that
the
goods
had
arrived,
has
the
alternative
under
the
customs
procedure,
by
statute
and
indeed,
i
am
advised,
this
is
routine
with
customs,
they
encourage
it,
that
you
ask
for
immediate
delivery
rather
than
going
through
all
the
paper
work,
you
can
go
to
a
customs
house
broker,
you
can
fill
out
a
few
papers
and
say,
"under
the
provision
of
the
statute,
we
want
immediate
delivery,"
and
then
the
rest
of
the
paper
work
is
done
later.
that
was
done
through
a
customs
house
broker
who
took
the
description
of
the
goods
from
the
bill
of
lading.
from
all
that
appears,
it
was
a
totally
innocent
mistake
that
the
customs
house
broker
made.
it
was
submitted
to
customs
and
they
said,
"look,
there's
a
discrepancy
between
what
appears
on
your
application
for
immediate
delivery
and
what
appears
on
these
invoices.
consequently,
we're
not
releasing
the
goods.
"this
led
to
various
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
point
this
out
what
happened,
those
goods
contained,
and
the
first
letters
that
went
to
the
customs
service
contains
strong
protest
about
the
fact
that
these
goods
were
dated
film,
most
of
them
were
dated
film
which
would
expire
a
year
and
a
half
later.
by
the
time
the
customs
service
sent
a
notice
of
seizure,
which
was
in
may,
by
the
time
the
protest
--
protests
were
filed
a
week
after
the
notice
of
seizure;
within
a
week
the
requests
for
remission
were
filed
--
customs
waited
four
months,
until
october
of
1970
before
saying,
"now,
you
have
to
submit
$40,000
to
get
these
goods
out."
at
that
point
the
importer
felt
that
he
had
written
to
customs,
these
were
dated
films,
the
summer
season
had
passed
for
which
the
films
really
were
originally
hoped
to
be
out
on
the
market,
and
he
paid
the
$40,000.
i
can
represent
to
the
court
again,
it's
not
in
the
record,
there
was
a
petition
submitted
afterwards
to
seek
to
return
that
$40,000
to
customs
because
it
was
felt
that
it
was
inappropriate.
but
the
importer
is
in
a
position
in
those
circumstances
where
he
can't
really
argue
with
the
united
states.
they've
got
his
dated
film,
which
is
perishable.
they
have
stainless
steel
razor
blades,
which
were
in
there,
too,
and
the
record
reflects
that
the
attorney
then
representing
the
importer
wrote
to
customs
and
said,
"look,
chromium-plated
blades
are
coming
out
on
the
market.
there's
a
very
limited
period
of
time
in
which
we
can
still
sell
stainless
steel
razor
blades.
so
we
really
have
to
get
those
off
the
dock
and
out
into
the
market
as
quickly
as
possible.
"under
those
circumstances,
the
importer
had
no
choice
other
than
to
pay
the
money
to
get
what
was
really
close
to
$600,000
worth
of
goods,
and
hope
that
a
subsequent
petition
might
result
in
some
remission
of
that
$40,000
demand
by
the
united
states.
of
course,
when
the
goods
came
back,
165,000
was
missing,
and
that's
what
gives
rise
to
the
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
question
in
this
case
is,
whether
if
the
united
states
finally,
having
taken
these
goods
--
certainly
the
importer
was
not
voluntarily
surrendering
them
to
the
united
states,
but
the
united
states
having
taken
the
goods
--
having
taken
them
under
a
statute
and
under
a
procedure
whereby
it
was
really
inviting
the
importer
to
submit
applications
following
the
time
that
these
goods
were
being
detained
--
now,
the
statute
provides
that
if
there's
any
case
of
forfeiture,
it
can't
be
done
unless
there's
a
libel,
a
proceeding
filed,
judicial
determination
with
regard
to
forfeiture.
so
during
the
entire
period
of
time
that
customs
had
these
goods,
it
was
subject
specifically
to
the
statute,
and
this
is
not
disputed,
to
19
usc
1605,
which
says,
"pending
such
disposition,
the
property
shall
be
stored
in
such
place
as
in
the
collector's
opinion
is
most
convenient
and
appropriate
with
due
regard
to
the
expense
involved,
whether
or
not
the
place
of
storage
is
within
the
judicial
district,"
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
the
statute
says
it
shall
be
placed
and
remain
in
the
custody
of
the
collector
for
the
district
in
which
the
seizure
was
made
to
await
disposition
according
to
law.
it's
in
his
custody
to
await
disposition
according
to
law.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
suppose
so,
although
i
think
the
government's
brief
in
this
court,
at
least,
asserts
mainly
that
there
is
no
bailment
in
this
case,
not
because
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
it
but
because
in
some
way
the
custody
of
the
united
states
is
inconsistent
with
title
remaining
in
the
importer.
and
of
course
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
our
position
on
that
is
that
whether
something
is
a
bailment
implied
in
fact
depends
of
course,
when
you're
dealing
with
the
government,
on
what
the
government
knows
about
its
obligations
under
the
law.
of
course,
the
law
says
to
the
collector
of
customs,
you're
the
custodian
of
these
goods
until
such
time
as
the
court
acts.
that
means
that
when
the
collector
of
customs
takes
them,
he
knows,
not
by
operation
of
law
in
the
sense
that
it's
contrary
to
his
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
it
wouldn't,
of
course.
we've
made
the
point
in
our
brief
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
you've
granted
cert
because
the
court
of
claims
has
said
that
by
reason
of
2680(c)
we
can't
bring
a
contract
action.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
tends
to
be
immune
even
under
the
tucker
act,
even
under
implied
contract.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
of
claims
really
said
it
was
not
an
implied
contract.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
it
wouldn't,
i
agree,
and
i
think
the
united
states
really
in
this
court
has,
we
have
said
in
our
reply
brief,
relegated
to
a
secondary
role
the
court
of
claims
reasoning,
which
i
think
the
court
of
claims
seized
on
the
2680(c)
language,
and
now
the
united
states
mainly
argues
in
this
court
there's
no
implied
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
what
we
argued
in
our
petition.
i
assume
that
that's
what
you've
granted
cert
on.
we
filed
a
short
petition,
we
said
this
conflicts
with
the
2nd
circuit,
and
you
granted
cert.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
case,
the
one
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
schmaltz'
case?
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh.
the
united
states
v.
sole,
mr.
chief
justice,
involved
the
still
that
was
being
run
on
a
premises
and
the
language
in,
which
is
quoted
in
19,
which
very
specifically
says
that
title
remains
in
the
party
until
judicial
condemnation
refers,
it
seems
to
me,
not
to
the
customs
situation
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
the
language
immediately
preceding
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
right
to
the
property
vests
in
the
united
states
although
their
title
is
not
perfected
until
judicial
condemnation.
so
the
title
doesn't
a
right
in
a
certain
possessory
sense,
and
we
don't
doubt
that
even
as
applied
to
customs.
and
we
think
that
the
stowell
case
does
not
apply
to
the
customs
procedure.
it's
really
quite
different.
stowell
is
a
case
where
if
revenue
officers
seize
a
still,
from
that
point
on
it's
clearly
contraband,
it's
clearly
illegal.
they
say,
"all
right,
we
have
now
possession
of
this
property
which
is
contraband."
on
the
other
hand,
everything
goes
through
customs.
everything
that
comes
in
from
abroad,
in
terms
of
commercial
goods,
goes
through
customs.
customs
detains
them;
customs
may
say
as
it
has,
it
did
after
a
delay
in
this
case.
"all
right,
now
we've
seized
them
and
we're
asking
you
to
invoke
the
procedures.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
if
somebody
--
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
were
something
different,
if
it
were
not
going
through
the
regular
procedures
and
it
were
in
that
sense
contraband,
if
it
were
like
narcotic
drugs
or
something,
i
think
it
might
be
in
that
sense,
because
then
the
owner
has
no
rights
do
it.
but
i
think
when
something
goes
through
the
regular
customs
procedure,
everybody
knows
--
we're
talking
about
what
the
parties
expect,
what
they
anticipate,
and
really
what
is
the
tacit
understanding,
and
i
think
that's
really
what
implied
contract
in
fact,
implied
bailment
in
fact
means.
what
is
the
tacit
understanding
of
the
parties?
i
think
a
customs
officer
who
seizes
marihuana
off
the
coast
of
the
united
states,
his
tacit
understanding
is
he
is
not
holding
it
as
a
bay
leaf
for
anybody.
but
the
customs
officer
who
says,
"well,
this
is
coming
in
with
all
the
routine
goods
that
are
being
shipped
into
the
united
states,"
they're
being
processed,
in
that
context
customs
has
a
tacit
understanding
that
it
is
holding
these
goods
pursuant
to
the
ordinary
processes
and
pursuant
to
the
procedures
under
which
the
importer
makes
his
petition,
if
he
thinks
it
ought
not
to
be
forfeited,
if
he
thinks
there
is
an
innocent
reason
for
the
mistake
in
the
documentation
being
submitted
to
the
government,
and
consequently
the
statute
--
indeed,
it's
not
merely
section
1605,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it's
also
28
usc
2465,
which
we
quote
at
page
11
of
our
brief.
it
says,
"upon
the
entry
of
judgment
for
the
claimant
in
any
proceeding
to
condemn
or
forfeit
property
seized
under
any
act
of
congress,
such
property
shall
be
returned
forthwith
to
the
claimant
or
his
agent."
so
the
statute
both
says
you're
the
custodian
and
you
know
that
under
the
statute
you
have
to
return
the
property
to
the
claimant
or
his
agent.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
think
it
could.
i
think
you
could
have
both.
absolutely.
and
--
but
the
court
of
claims
was
wrong
and
over
board
because
they
read
the
tort
claims
act
rule
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir,
it
could
give
rise
to
a
tort
claim
if
you
could
prove
--
it
might
be
the
highest
burden
of
proof
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
you
couldn't
bring
a
tort
claim
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
this
action
was
brought
only
within
the
contract
statute
of
limitations.
that's
why
the
contract
theory
is
essential
to
the
petitioner.
it
can
only,
the
claim
can
only
be
asserted
if
it
is
a
bailment
or
contract
claim,
because
it's
too
late
as
a
tort
claim.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
no.
i
think
my
point,
if
we
win
on
just
2680
we're
out
of
court
on
the
tort
theory
because
it's
too
late
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
too
late
to
bring
a
tort
action.
mr.
nathan
lewin
so
we're
--
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
so
we're
only
in
court
under
a
contract
action
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
and
if
the
court
of
claims
is
right
in
its
broad
reading
of
2680,
contract
actions
are
barred
by
2680.
now,
the
government
doesn't
apparently
make
that
argument
here,
that
contract
actions
are
barred.
they
say
the
court
of
claims
is
right
in
its
general
reading
of
2680
and
the
contract
action
is
barred
in
any
event
because
there's
no
implied
contract
in
fact.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
if
one
looks
at
the
language
--
we've
reprinted
at
pages
1a
and
2a
of
our
principal
brief
--
the
language
of
the
tort
claims
act,
the
series
of
exceptions
as
originally
enacted
in
1947.
now,
when
congress
wanted
specifically
to
say
that
a
government
agency
should
not
be
liable
from
any
damage
caused
by
loss,
it
knew
very
well
how
to
say
so,
and
it
did
in
subsection
(b).
it
said,
"any
claim
arising
out
of
the
loss,
miscarriage,
or
negligent
transmission
of
letters
or
postal
matter."
it
would
have
been
the
simplest
thing,
had
congress
really
intended
to
do
what
the
court
of
claims
says,
to
say
is
to
see
any
claim
arising
out
of
the
loss
of
any
goods
or
merchandise
seized
or
taken
by
any
officer
of
customs
or
excise.
they
didn't
say
that.
they
said
any
claim
arising
in
respect
of
the
detention
of
any
goods
or
merchandise.
and
that
has,
we
submit,
a
very
narrow
and
specific
meaning.
it
means
exactly,
if
one
takes
the
film
in
this
case,
that
if
the
ordinary
government
processes
resulted
in
all
the
goods
being
given
back
to
the
petitioner,
he
got
every
last
piece
of
film
back,
and
the
film
was
dated
and
therefore
it
was
of
no
value
because
of
the
delay
caused
by
detention
alone,
he'd
have
no
tort
claim.
detention
is
what
causes
the
harm.
but
when
the
film
is
missing,
when
it's
lost
or
when
it's
damaged,
that's
not
what
congress
intended
to
protect
against
or
intended
to
provide
an
exemption
for.
congress
didn't
say
loss
or
damage
to
the
goods;
it
said
merely
detention.
nor,
for
that
matter,
did
congress
have
the
intention
that
the
court
of
claims
said
it
had
to
give
this
broad
power
to
customs
officers
to
conduct
their
duties
unfettered
or
unrestrained
by
any
possibility
of
civil
suit.
because
when
congress
wanted
to
have
that
intention
specifically
provided
for
it.
subsection
(e),
for
example,
says
that
there's
no
claim
allowed
for
any
act
or
omission
in
administering
the
provisions
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
now,
had
congress
wanted
to
say
in
administering
the
provisions
of
that,
the
customs
law,
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930,
or
anything
like
that,
it
would
have
said
it.
or,
for
example,
subsection
(1)
says
any
claim
arising
from
the
activities
of
the
tennessee
valley
authority.
they
didn't
say
any
activities
of
the
united
states
customs
service.
that's
what
congress
would
have
said
had
it
really
had
the
intention
of
immunizing
the
united
states
customs
service,
the
way
the
court
of
claims
thought.
and
that's
why
it
appears
to
me,
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
court
of
claims
didn't
look
at
the
legislative
history.
they
didn't
compare
it
with
these
other
provisions.
they
immediately
read
this
section
and
they
said,
"well,
now,
look.
here
it
says
detention
of
goods
and
merchandise
by
any
officer
of
customs
or
excise,
and
therefore
that
must
have
meant
that
the
customs
bureau
is
intended
to
be
exempt
in
all
its
broad
enforcement
authority".
but
that's
just
wrong.
if
one
looks
at
the
language,
or
if
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history,
because
we
have
set
it
out
in
our
brief,
and
i
certainly
don't
have
the
time
to
go
into
it
in
detail,
but
judge
holtzoff,
later
judge
holtzoff
who
was
then
a
special
the
principal
proponent
of
this
legislation
on
behalf
of
the
administration.
he
testified
before
the
congress
that
this
provision,
subsection
(c),
was
not
like
other
provisions
which
were
intended,
like
the
postal
service
provision,
which
were
intended
to
immunize
government
agencies
which
were
carrying
out
important
functions
and
could
not
therefore
be
bothered
or
should
not
be
restrained
in
some
way
by
the
possibility
of
civil
suits.
he
said
certain
provisions,
including
subsection
(c),
were
designed
to
simply
preserve
existing
remedies
for
these
kinds
of
situations.
well,
the
existing
remedies
with
regard
to
any
improper
collection
of
customs
or
duty
were
certain
statutory
provisions
which,
again
we
specified
in
our
brief,
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit
if
goods
are
harmed
or
lost
or
damaged
in
the
course
of
custody.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we're
not
home
free.
but
certainly
so
far
as
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
claims
is
concerned
--
let
me
point
out,
the
court
of
claims
said,
and
the
court
of
claims
has
been
very
careful
in
many
cases
and
the
has
cited
them
--
the
court
of
claims
has
been
very
careful
in
many
cases
to
say,
to
keep
this
distinction
between
bailments
implied
in
fact
and
bailments
implied
in
law.
and
yet
the
court
of
claims
said
as
to
this
particular
bailment
that
on
both,
as
a
result
of
the
statute
and
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
notice
of
seizure,
which
was
served
on
the
petitioner
in
october
of
1970,
said,
"look,
you
give
us
$40,000,
we'll
give
you
your
goods
back,"
on
that
basis
the
court
of
claims
said
this
is
a
strong
case
for
a
bailment
in
fact."
page
30a
of
the
appendix.
the
statute
cited
by
the
plaintiff,
along
with
the
action
of
the
united
states
customs
service
in
agreeing
to
return
the
seized
goods
upon
payment
of
a
$40,000
fine
by
hatzlachh
could
make
a
strong
case
for
the
existence
of
an
implied
in
fact
contract,
properly
to
preserve
and
redeliver
all
the
goods
to
hatzlachh.
all
other
things
being
equal,
such
a
factual
and
legal
combination
might
enable
plaintiff
to
prevail.
now,
this
is
from
a
court
which
in
a
whole
line
of
cases
has
said,
"we
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
implied
in
law
contracts,"
and
they've
drawn
that
distinction
very
clearly,
and
yet
as
to
these
facts,
they
recognize
that
both
the
statute
and
the
fact
that
the
notices
of
seizure
anticipate
this
kind
of
a
thing,
makes
a
case
under
which
they
thought
if
not
for
2680
(c)
the
plaintiff
would
prevail.
and
we
think
that
same
thing
applies
here,
because
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
definitely
would,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
think
detention,
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
go
and
bring
a
tort
claims
act
to
challenge
the
legality
of
detention.
if
one
looks
at
what
judge
holtzoff
was
talking
about,
and
he
said
there
are
other
tax
statutes
and
other
ways
of
challenging
the
legality
of
detentions,
i
think
what
congress
was
concerned
with
is,
if
we
enact
the
tort
claims
act
and
the
collector
of
customs
then
detains
property,
people
will
be
able
to
go
in
to
a
district
court
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
say,
"look,
this
act
of
detention
is
a
tort.
it's
illegal.
the
detention
is
illegal,
and
i
can
challenge
it
as
a
tort.
"so
therefore
congress
said,
"look,
you
can't
challenge
it
as
a
tort.
we've
got
all
the
existing
remedies
under
which
you
can
challenge
customs
seizures,
customs
detentions."
and
they
only
had
to
do
with
the
detention
itself,
not
with
what
might
happen
after
the
goods
were
detained.
if
they
were
lost,
if
they
were
damaged
in
some
other
way,
because
i
think
as
you
pointed
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
words
simply
could
have
been,
"or
failure
to
return
goods
or
merchandise
by
any
officer
of
customs."
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
detention
i
think
carries
a
very
temporary
meaning.
a
detention
is
something
which
is
not
a
permanent
loss.
failure
to
return
i
think
is
a
permanent
loss.
a
detention
means
you
temporarily
are
keeping
somebody,
either
keeping
a
person
detained
or
keeping
the
goods
detained,
but
it
certainly
has
a
limit,
it
sounds
as
if
it's
a
limitation
in
time
in
some
way
by
people
who
were
responsible
officers
of
the
government.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
would
be
a
question.
i
think
the
court
of
claims
has
indicated
that
it
would
view
it
very
possibly
as
an
implied
contract.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir,
the
tucker
act.
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
as
a
constitutional
claim,
no;
it
was
an
implied
contract.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
was
an
alternative
claim
that
was
made
below;
it
wasn't
passed
on
really
by
the
court
of
claims,
as
to
whether
it
was
founded
on
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir;
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
problem
is,
our
time
has
run
out.
mr.
nathan
lewin
so
we
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
could
have
done
that,
yes.
we
could
have
done
that,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jones
has
been
speaking
throughout
his
argument
about
the
traditional
remedy
under
2006
and
saying
that
we
have
conceded
that
that
is
a
remedy
that
has
traditionally
been
applicable.
by
no
means,
2006
is
not
a
statute
which
grants
any
remedy
whatever.
although
a
hundred
years
ago
and
more,
there
were
suits
against
individual
collectors
of
customs,
there
are
not
suits
today
against
individual
collectors
of
customs
which
--
i
think
he
said
during
the
course
of
colloquy
--
treasury
has
always
paid.
these
suits
simply
don't
exist.
since
the
tort
claims
act
has
been
enacted,
since
the
united
states
has
agreed
to
be
sued
directly,
the
only
suits
that
i
have
found
reference
to
in
this
regard
have
been,
for
example,
the
alliance
insurance
company
case,
which
was
a
suit
that
was
brought
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
given
that
the
united
states
has
now
decided
that
individual
employees
are
no
longer
to
be
sued,
they
passed
the
federal
tort
claims
act
so
you
don't
have
to
go
running
after
the
individual
employee,
it
is
just
totally
inconsistent
with
the
current
thrust
of
federal
statute
and
remedies
against
the
federal
government
to
say
you
have
to
sue
under
the
cause
of
action
that
you
had
150
years
ago
against
a
collector
of
customs
and
under
a
civil
war
statute,
2006,
which
appears
in
the
footnote
on
page
27
of
the
government's
brief,
is
a
statute
passed
in
1863
to
keep
levies
from
being
made
against
the
property
of
collectors
of
customs
--
executions
shall
not
issue
against
a
collector.
it
doesn't
say
you
may
bring
a
suit
against
the
collector
or
you
may
bring
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
it
says
don't
execute
--
when
you
bring
one
of
these
suits,
which
people
have
brought
against
individual
collectors,
you
can't
execute
against
his
property
because
the
united
states
will
pay
if
he
has
been
acting
with
probable
cause.
that
is
not
a
traditional
remedy.
it
is
just
not
framed
in
those
terms,
it
never
has
been
a
traditional
remedy.
in
terms
of
this
actually
being
an
implied
contract
in
fact,
the
fact
that
there
isn't
that
much
of
a
consensual
arrangement
still
doesn't
make
it
different
from
cases
in
which
the
united
states,
for
example,
in
a
taking,
for
example,
has
flooded
somebody's
property
--
this
court
has
had
cases
such
as
the
dickenson
and
lynah
case,
we
quoted
from
the
lynah
case
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
partly
involved
in
the
fifth
amendment,
but
this
court
has
very
clearly
said,
language
by
justice
frankfurter,
i
think,
in
the
dickenson
case,
that
in
no
circumstances
does
either
a
taking
or
there
was
an
implied
promise
by
the
government
to
pay
for
it.
we
cited
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
the
language
of
judge
learned
hand
in
the
c.
f.
harms
case,
where
a
barge
was
taken.
he
said
it
is
clearly
an
implied
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
same
is
true
here.
what
you
have
done
in
carrying
out
a
governmental
purpose,
you
have
taken
custody
of
everybody's
property
as
they
come
into
the
united
states.
you
go
through
a
procedure.
the
united
states
ought
to
pay
if
it
is
lost
while
it
is
in
the
united
states
possession
during
that
period
of
time.
it
is
certainly
not
fair
to
impose
that
obligation
for
that
loss
on
an
individual
importer
who
is
totally
blameless.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
why
there
is
no
claim
that
this
is
a
taking.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
is
an
implied
bailment
in
an
implied
contract
in
which
the
united
states,
if
it
has
it
for
government
purposes
in
its
possession
for
temporary
detention,
if
it
gives
it
back
that
is
fine,
there
is
no
suit
for
the
detention.
but
certainly
if
the
united
states
for
one
reason
or
another
doesn't
give
all
the
property
back,
then
it
is
the
one
who
should
be
held
liable
for
policy
reasons.
mr.
nathan
lewin
in
dickenson
he
talks
about
it
being
an
implied
promise
to
pay
for
the
consequences
of
building
a
dam
which
spreads
water
on
somebody's
property,
there
is
an
implied
promise.
and
judge
hand
spoke
about
the
bailment,
an
implied
contract
where
you
take
a
barge
in
emergency
circumstances,
the
army
had
neither
asked
no
leave
of
the
railroad
for
anything
it
might
do,
it
could
move
it
when
it
close.
everybody
understood
that.
the
railroad
understood
that
and
therefore
there
was
nothing
lacking
that
was
essential
to
a
bailment.
he
said
that
was
a
bailment.
