justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lewin,
it
has
been
my
experience
in
my
service
here
that
the
court
of
claims
is
usually
astute
to
seize
opportunities
to
broaden
its
jurisdiction.
it
resolves
doubtful
questions
frequently
in
favor
of
its
jurisdiction,
and
if
it
were
a
very
close
case,
i
would
have
thought
the
court
of
claims
would
have
decided
it
the
other
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lewin,
out
of
that
language,
i
take
it
you
infer
a
commitment
to
return
the
goods
on
the
part
of
customs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
take
it
the
opposition
will
take
just
the
opposite
approach
to
these
facts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
is
that
these
same
facts
gave
rise
to
both
the
contract
action
and
the
tort?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
really?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
let's
assume
you
construe
subsection
(c)
so
it
doesn't
immunize.
under
testan,
you
still
have
to
show
that
there
is
some
affirmative
duty
imposed
on
the
government
to
respond
in
money
damages,
do
you
not?
i
mean,
you're
not
home
free
if
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
if
we
agree
with
you
on
subsection
(c),
it
would
be
quite
clear
that
you
could
bring
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
under
the
tort
claims
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
have
if
you
had
decided
rightly
originally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
in
the
case
of
stolen
goods,
say
a
third
party
broke
into
a
government,
customs
warehouse
and
stole
the
goods.
there's
no
government
negligence.
there
then
would
be
no
remedy
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
although
if
your
opponent
is
right
here,
there
would
be
an
implied
contract,
bailment
remedy.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
tort
and
the
contract
remedies
are
not
necessarily
coextensive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
has
to
prove
that
the
customs
officer
had
possession
of
them
in
the
first
place?
i
know
what
the
papers
said,
but
does
somebody
have
to
prove
that
he
actually
received
--
that
these
$165,000
worth
of
goods
were
actually
there
in
the
first
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
wouldn't
be
any
presumption
that
he
received
them,
would
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
a
provision
somewhere
that
says
if
at
the
end
of
some
litigation
the
government
loses,
they
are
suppose
to
return
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
wouldn't
create
any
claim
under
the
federal
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
the
reason
i
take
it
is
that
that
statute
created
no
substantive
right,
is
that
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would
say
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
action
against
the
united
states,
that
statute
would
have
said
that
upon
failure
to
return
the
united
states
shall
pay
damages?
it
would
have
to
say
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
position
is
that
the
united
states
doesn't
need
to
be
insulated
against
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
an
affirmative
authorization
to
sue
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
whether
that
has
ever
happened?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
has
never
happened,
so
the
answer
is
no,
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
because
of
the
plaintiff's
choice
to
sue
the
united
states
rather
than
the
collector
personally.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
dickenson
and
lynah
in
part
depend
on
the
fact
that
where
the
government
takes
and
doesn't
bring
an
action,
the
person
who
is
the
victim
of
the
taking
has
to
bring
an
action
for
inverse
taking
and
has
to
show
an
authority
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
take
and
the
taking
isn't
enough.
isn't
that
what
frankfurter's
language
in
dickenson
refers
to?
