chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-1175,
hatzlachh
supply
company
v.
united
states.
mr.
lewin,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
is
a
detention
of
property,
isn't
it,
mr.
lewin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
it
changed
its
character
at
a
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
paying
$60,000,
though,
to
dispose
of
this
matter,
there
is
some
intimation,
at
least,
that
it
wasn't
totally
inadvertent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
old
case
of
united
states
v.
sole
is
no
longer
the
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
the
case
in
which
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
the
settled
doctrine
of
this
court
that
the
property,
the
specific
property
shall
be
forfeited,
and
the
forfeiture
takes
place,
takes
effect
immediately
upon
the
commission
of
the
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
the
language
was
not
quite
that,
the
forfeiture
constitutes
a
statutory
transfer
of
the
right
to
the
united
states
at
the
time
the
offense
is
committed.
in
other
words,
as
soon
as
they
seized
the
still
out
in
the
woods,
without
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
any
judicial
proceeding,
the
u.
s.
marshals
or
revenue
agents
took
the
title,
they
took
physical
possession
and
title.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
all
this
material
had
been
seized
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
they
were
trying
to
land
it
on
the
coast
of
new
jersey
or
someplace,
a
smuggling
operation,
wouldn't
it
be
in
the
same
posture
as
the
still
in
the
stowell
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
this
would
not
fall
within
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
tort
claims
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
language,
mr.
lewin,
of
subsection
(c)
instead
of
using
the
words
"or
the
detention,"
"or
the
failure
to
return
and
account
for."
would
you
think
that
would
make
the
statute
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
they
still
in
a
sense
detaining,
when
they
do
not
return?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
would,
on
the
contrary,
i
would
read
detention
to
mean
just
exactly
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
common
law
--
weren't
there
at
least
three
different
standards
of
proof,
depending
on
whether
you
were
a
bailee
for
hire
or
a
bailee
for
the
benefit
of
the
bailor
or
bailee
for
the
benefit
of
the
bailee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
any
difference
in
the
kind
of
seizure,
whether
it
is
somewhere
just
off
the
coast
or
while
they
are
unloading
a
ship
at
midnight
or
seized
in
the
customs
house,
as
a
matter
of
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
they
seized
the
goods
in
either
situation,
that
title
leaves
the
ostensible
owner,
whatever
title
was
in
the
possessor
has
gone
even
if
the
possessor
title
of
the
united
states
does
not
become
perfect,
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
it
is
redeemed,
as
it
was
here,
if
that
is
the
right
word,
that
is
in
effect
a
sale
back,
is
that
the
idea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
buying
it
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
court
of
claims
didn't
deal
with
whether
this
was
a
claim
under
federal
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
it
also
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
were
powers
of
attorney
between
the
united
states
and
the
indians
which
is
certainly
a
consensual
sort
of
thing,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
monday's
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lewin,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
involved
in
the
fifth
amendment,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
the
firth
amendment
contemplate
taking
for
the
use
of
the
government
and
not
the
negligent
loss
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
