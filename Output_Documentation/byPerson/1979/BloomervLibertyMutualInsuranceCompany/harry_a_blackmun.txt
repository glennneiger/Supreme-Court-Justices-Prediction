of
course,
that's
just
the
issue,
i
suppose.
if
he
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
guess
that's
really
the
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
in
your
example,
where
we
just
went
through
it
with
mr.
justice
white,
of
a
$10,000
recovery
and
a
$6,000
paid
in
advance,
and
maybe
$4,000
go
for
expenses
and
litigation.
what
it
all
boils
down
to,
i
suppose,
is,
there's
really
no
incentive
to
bring
a
lawsuit
in
that
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
that's
a
pretty
good
idea;
we
just
don't
have
incentives
for
lawsuits
that
aren't
very
valuable.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
under
the
second
circuit
rule.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he's
going
to
get
the
$4,000.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
in
our
hypothetical,
there
won't
be
anything
after
the
lawyer
is
paid
and
the
$6,000
is
reimbursed
to
the
stevedore,
or
the
stevedore's
insurance
carrier.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
provision
in
the
act
for
the
payment
of
an
attorney's
fee
by
the
employer
to
the
employee
if
the
employee
must
sue
for
his
compensation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
payable?
suppose
the
employer
--
suppose
he
claims
that
his
compensation,
that
he's
been
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
and
the
employer
denies
it.
and
the
employee
has
to
bring
action
to
get
his
compensation.
suppose
he
wins.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that's
for
the
--
isn't
that
under
the
statute?
