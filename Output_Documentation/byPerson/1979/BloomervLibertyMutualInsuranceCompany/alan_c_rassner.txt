mr.
alan
c.
rassner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
appeal
arises
out
of
a
longshoreman's
accident
on
board
a
ship.
the
longshoreman
collected
compensation
benefits
and
medical
benefits,
pursuant
to
the
longshoremens/harbor
workers
compensation
act,
and
at
the
same
time
proceeded
to
bring
a
third-party
action
against
the
ship
owner.
the
action
against
the
ship
owner
was
eventually
compromised
for
the
sum
of
$60,000.
during
that
interim
period,
mr.
bloomer
had
recovered
compensation
payments
and
medical
benefits
of
some
$17,000.
the
question
therefore
is
presented
whether
the
recovery
in
the
third-party
action,
the
compensation
insurance
carrier,
the
respondent
herein,
should
share
proportionately
with
mr.
bloomer
the
costs
of
affecting
the
recovery.
now,
i
don't
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
equity
and
just
common
justice,
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
there
should
be
equitable
apportionment.
for
example,
the
recovery
in
the
third-party
of,
let's
say,
$10,000,
and
the
lien
is
$3,000;
therefore,
$7,000,
or
70
percent
of
the
recovery,
inures
to
the
benefit
of
the
longshoreman,
and
$3,000,
or
30
percent
of
the
recovery,
inures
to
the
benefit
of
the
compensation
insurance
carrier.
and
there
is
no--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
if
i
may
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
but--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
doesn't
really
expose
the
employer,
the
stevedore,
to
a
new
liability.
what
is
happening
here
is
the
stevedore,
or
the
employer,
is
receiving
back
payments
that
it
initially
made
out.
under
our
american
system,
if
anyone
--
well,
let's
say
if
i
lend
my
friend
a
thousand
dollars,
for
example,
and
he
must
hire
a
lawyer
to
collect
that
thousand
dollars
back
from
me
because
of
my
failure
to
pay,
my
friend
must
still
pay
lawyers'
fees
to
collect
his
own
thousand
dollars.
the
stevedore
here
is
recovering
money,
and
there
is
no
reason
from
an
equitable
point
of
view
why
he
should
not
pay
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
for
making
that
recovery.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
no.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
well--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
judicial
decisions
are
the
source
of
the
lien.
and
the
judicial
decisions
were
based
on
equitable
principles.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
well,
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
oh,
i
see
what
you
mean,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the
compensation
plus
what
he
netted?
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
he
would
still
recover
$40,000.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
that
is
correct.
however,
here
the
$17,000
doesn't
go
into
his
pocket
--
well,
all
right,
i
see
what
you're
driving
at.
you're
saying
that
in
effect
there
is
some
degree
of
double
recovery,
perhaps
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i
follow;
i
follow.
true,
there
is
some
degree
of
overlapping.
he
does
not
recover
the
full
17
again,
but
only
one-third
of
it,
in
effect,
if
petitioner's
position
is
sustained
by
this
court.
however
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
he
winds
up
precisely
with
$40,000
in
his
pocket,
yet.
however,
there
is
a
compensation
statute,
and
we
must
deal
with
the
situation
as
it
does
exist.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that
is
correct.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
compensation
the
statute
that
does
so.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
you
say
as
substitutes,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
well,
i'm
not
exactly
sure
that
the
compensation
statute
was
meant
as
a
substitute
for
it.
what
it
does,
in
effect,
is
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that
is
correct.
he
is
barred
from
suing
for
negligence
against
his
employer.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
he
does,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that
is
correct.
it's
a
remedial
legislation;
there's
no
question
about
it;
for
the
benefit
of
the
longshoreman.
if,
as
your
honor
pointed
out
--
i
want
to
deal
with
this
problem
that
mr.
chief
justice,
you
raised
a
moment
ago,
about
the
double
recovery.
there
is
admittedly
a
certain
amount
of
overlapping.
in
other
words,
if
petitioner's
position
is
sustained
by
this
court,
the
longshoreman
will
recovery
something
more
than
he
otherwise
would
recovery
if
he
just
sued
directly.
however,
as
in
so
many
questions,
including
--
that
appear
before
this
court
--
this
is
a
question
of
balancing
the
equities.
should
the
longshoreman
be
allowed
some
amount
of
double
recovery,
as
opposed
to
permitting
the
employer-stevedore
to
recover
back
his
lien
with
no
effort,
no
expense
and
money,
nothing
whatsoever;
he
just
sits
back
and
lies
on
the
back
of
the
longshoreman
who
brings
the
action.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
he
has.
but
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
anybody
who
has
paid
out
money,
once
he's
paid
out
this
money,
it's
gone.
the
stevedore
has
paid
it
out.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
well,
somebody
has
to
sue
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
if
there's
going
to
be
a
third-party
recovery,
yes.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
is,
once
the
money
is
paid
out,
unless
somebody
sues
to
get
it
back,
it
certainly
is
gone.
somebody
has
to
sue.
somebody
has
to
pay
the
lawyer
for
collecting
that
money
back
for
the
stevedore.
there
is
no
equitable
reason
for
it
to
be
the
longshoreman.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
he
will.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
it
will.
and
that--under
933(e),
the
statute
your
honor
just
referred
to,
the--when
the
stevedore
sues,
the
stevedore
gets
his
full
lien
back.
he,
in
addition,
gets
an
amount
to
cover
any
future
compensation
payments.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
and
he
gets
the
attorney's
fee.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
and
one-fifth
of
the
balance.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that's
correct.
and
i
think
there
is
a
reason
for
this,
your
honor.
the
stevedore
is
given
a
reward
for
bringing
the
action;
he's
given
an
incentive
to
sue.
and
in
that
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
which
he
otherwise
would
not
have,
because
there
are
very
few
instances
in
the
law
that
i
know
about
where
someone
who
sues
gets
his
attorney's
fees
in
addition
to
the
proceeds
of
the
lawsuit.
there
are
some,
but
not
many.
now
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
if
he
did
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
if
he
did
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
if
he
did
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
and
they
don't
often
do
that,
as
a
practical
matter.
but
to
deal
with
your
honor's
question,
the
--
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
--
excuse
me
--
the
stevedore
is,
in
effect,
being
given
a
reward
for
bringing
the
lawsuit,
something
he
would
not
ordinarily
get.
now,
when
the
longshoreman'
sues,
if
the
lien
is
repaid
in
full,
aside
from
that
little
one-fifth
excess,
the
stevedore
is
reaping
the
same
reward;
when
he
sues
--
when
the
stevedore
sues,
he
must
take
some
initiative.
he
must
give
himself
a
lawyer,
and
risk
the
loss
of
lawyer's
fees.
he
must
suffer
the
discomfiture
of
being
an
active
litigant,
appear
in
discovery
proceedings,
worry
about
witnesses
for
trial.
he
is
exposing
himself
to
a
risk
of
a
judgment
against
himself
for
costs.
for
all
of
these
things,
for
taking
these
initiatives,
congress
has
rewarded
him,
given
him
an
incentive
to
bring
the
action
for
the
benefit
of
the
longshoreman,
hoping
there'll
be
something
left
over
for
him
at
the
end.
however,
when
the
longshoreman
sues,
the
second
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case
puts
the
stevedore
right
back
in
the
same
beneficial
situation
that
he
would
be
when
he
sues,
pursuant
to
933(e).
and
that,
i
say,
is
totally
inequitable;
the
statute
did
not
intend
that.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that
is
a--your
honor
is
correct,
there's
a
void
in
the
statute.
congress
has
always
left
the
distribution
of
the
recovery,
when
the
longshoreman
sues,
to
the
courts.
and
the
courts
have
always
ruled
on
it
whenever
necessary.
equitably,
before
the
1972
amendment,
there
were
cases
such
as
russo
and
ballwanz,
which
are
cited
in
the
brief,
which
did
not
allow
equitable
apportionment
of
the
attorney's
fees
between
the
stevedore
and
the
longshoreman
on
the
theory
that
when
you
had
the
third-party
case
allowed
under
the
ryan
decision,
the
stevedore
was
ultimately
paying
the
longshoreman
judgment.
so
it
would
be
inequitable
for
the
stevedore,
in
effect,
to
have
to
pay
twice.
he's
paying
the
judgment,
and
in
addition
to
that,
he's
paying
fees
on
what
he
recoups
to
the
attorney
who
sues
him.
this
could
not
be
tolerated.
and
so
it
was
disallowed.
however,
when
the
'72
amendments
came
in,
and
the
stevedore
is
now
insulated
from
the
third-party
suit,
he
cannot
be
sued,
now
the
courts,
fourth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
to
some
degree,
have
overruled
those
prior
decisions;
and
now,
because
the
equity
favors
the
longshoreman,
have
allowed
the
recovery
of
the
lien.
the
court
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
congress
never
gave
it
a
thought.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislation,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
there
is
nothing
anywhere
that
i
know
of,
at
least,
to
indicate
that
congress
even
visualized
this
problem
arising.
it
was
only
after
the
'72
amendments
were
in
effect,
and
the
courts
were
faced
with
the
problem
of
distributing
longshoremen's
recoveries,
that
the
inequity
became
apparent.
even
a
legislative
body
as
sophisticated
as
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can't
visualize
everything
that
might
arise
in
the
future.
and
they
didn't
in
this
case,
either
purposefully,
or
unintentionally,
i
don't
know
which.
but
the
fact
remains,
they
did
not
legislate
on
it.
and
there
is
absolutely
no
congressional
intent
expressed
or
implied
that
the
lien
should
not
be
equitably
apportioned.
failure
to
equitably
apportion
the
lien
can
result
in
very
serious
inequities.
going
back
to
my
$10,000
example,
which
is
easy
for
me
from
the
sake
of
mathematics,
the
recovery
being
$10,000;
assuming
the
lien
works
its
way
up
to
$6,000,
and
the
lawyers'
fees
are
one-third,
or
30
percent
or
40
percent,
it
gets
down
to
the
point
where
the
longshoreman
recovers
nothing
on
his
third-party
action.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
he
got
$40,000
and
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
right.
if
equitable
apportionment
is
allowed--all
right,
let
me
take
another
tack
if
i
may,
your
honor.
under
933(e),
if
a
stevedore
sues,
he
is
given
a
reward
for
bringing
the
lawsuit.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
about
it.
congress
gave
it
to
him
purposely
as
an
incentive.
if
the
longshoreman
sues,
the
stevedore
is
in
the
same
position.
if
there
is
some
small
overlapping
of
longshoremen's
benefits,
as
a
result
of
equitable
apportionment,
let
it
be
the
longshoreman's
reward.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
most
of
the
time,
your
honor,
a
private
insurance
policy
is
not
subrogated
to
the
rights
of
the
injured
person,
because
the
injured
person
is
paying
a
premium
for
the
policy.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that's
correct;
that's
correct.
i
don't
know
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
guess
as
to
whether
an
insurance
company
could
pressure
a
longshoreman
to
sue
because
of
the
insurance
company
wants
to
recover
back
its
funds.
i
would
say
that
the
longshoreman
should
have
this
initiative
himself,
and
the
desire
to
recover
compensation
for
his
pain
and
suffering,
and
for
general
damages
which
he
doesn't
get
under
workmen's
compensation
laws.
as
--
there
is
a
distinction
i
could
make
if
the
longshoreman
had
to
go
out,
let's
say,
and
borrow
money,
and
owed
a
debt
to
the
debtor
--
owed
a
debt
to
the
creditor
who
lent
him
the
money,
and
somehow
the
creditor
reduced
the
debt
to
judgment,
and
got
a
lien
on
the
longshoreman's
third-party
case,
then
i
would
say
there
should
be
no
equitable
apportionment
because
the
longshoreman
still,
no
matter
what
happens
in
the
third-party
case,
he
would
still
owe
the
money
to
the
creditor.
in
the
case
before
the
court,
the
longshoreman
does
not
owe
the
money
to
his
employer;
the
employer
cannot
sue
to
recover
back
the
compensation
benefits,
not
through
the
longshoreman.
the
only
one
who
might
possibly
owe
these
compensation
benefits
is
the
shipowner.
and
someone,
in
order
to
collect
this,
has
to
sue
the
shipowner.
and
what
i'm
saying
to
this
court
is
that
it
would
be
inequitable
to
cause
the
longshoreman
to
have
to
pay
the
attorney's
fees,
collect
the
money
from
the
shipowner,
which
inures
to
the
benefit
of
the
stevedore.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
well,
he
may.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
if
he
does
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
if
he
does
leave
it
to
the
employer,
and
the
employer
sues,
fine.
then
the
employer
takes
the
risk
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
the
employer
may
never
sue.
that's
not
the
case
before
the
court,
if
i
may,
respectfully.
if
the
employer
does
sue
and
takes
the
risk
and
recovers,
he's
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
933(e).
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that's
correct,
sir.
but
as
i
say,
if
the
employer
does
sue,
and
does
collect,
then
he's
entitled
to
those
933(e)
benefits.
but
he's
not
entitled
to
those
933(e)
benefits
when
the
longshoreman
is
the
one
who
does
the
suing.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
it
is
the
issue.
that
is
the
nub
of
the
issue.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
there
would
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
there
would
not
be
an
incentive
--
there
would
be
less
of
an
incentive
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
certainly.
because
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
under
the
second
circuit
rule,
yes.
and
one
of
the
things
that
congress
did
intend,
i
believe,
is
to
preserve
to
the
longshoremen
their
right
to
bring
these
third-party
cases.
that
was
specifically
provided
for,
and
that
should
not
be
discouraged.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
well
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
not
really,
your
honor.
the
longshoreman
benefits
as
well,
because
the
longshoreman
is
entitled
to
retain
two-thirds
of
the
net
recovery
after
the
lien
is
paid.
otherwise,
he
would
wind
up
with
nothing.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
if
the
--
under
the
second
circuit's
opinion,
the
longshoreman
would
get
nothing
under
that
hypothetical,
that's
correct.
but
under
the
--
let's
say
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
in
swift
v.
bolten,
or
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
battell,
the
longshoreman
would
recover.
the
longshoreman
would
get
two-thirds
of
$4,000.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes.
he
would
come
out
about
the
same
as
if
there
had
never
been
any
compensation.
however,
i
should
point
out
also
that
compensation
comprised
not
only
a
payment
that
goes
directly
to
the
longshoreman,
but
also
comprises
medical
and
hospital
payments
which
the
longshoreman
never
sees,
which
goes
to
effect
his
recovery.
they
are
charged
to
him;
they
are
charged
to
him.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
he
gets
the
benefit.
i
say,
they
are
charged
to
him.
but
he
never
sees
the
dollars.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
the
insurance
carrier
is
the
real
party
of
interest.
that's
why
liberty
mutual
is
named
as
the
respondent.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i
don't
know.
it
may.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
true.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
it
might
very
well
cost
him
more,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
excuse
me?
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
so
far
as
i
know,
it's
private.
stevedores
are
private
enterprises
in
business
to
make
money.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
and
they
have
their
own
insurance.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
well,
they
do;
i
believe
they
do
sometimes
finance
their
insurance
through
--
in
new
york
through
the
state
insurance
fund.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
under
my
rule,
they
will
have
to
pay
a
reasonable
fee
for
making
their
recovery.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
well
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
all
right.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
to
that
extent,
right.
i
think
we're
talking
here
about
a
comparatively
limited
extent
because--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
well,
i'm
talking
about
--
well,
yes.
if
the
lien
is
that
high,
yes,
it
does
amount
to
that.
that's
correct.
but
i
say
a
comparatively
limited
amount
because
the
1972
amendments
have
done
away
with
a
great
number
of
longshoremen's
cases.
and
in
view
of
the
amendments,
the
stevedore
and
the
longshoreman
are
in
effect
on
the
same
side
of
the
fence.
they
both
want
that
shipowner
to
pay.
because
if
the
shipowner
pays,
then
the
stevedore
stands
to
recoup
part
of
its
liens,
and
it
can
never
be
exposed
to
any
third-party
liability.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i'm
not
really
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question;
i
apologize.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
there
wouldn't
be
any
lawsuits.
it's
conceivable.
congress
can
pass
such
laws
as
it
sees
fit.
but
i
know
of
no
state
laws,
state
compensation
cases,
state
compensation
laws--schemes
or
the
longshoremen's
act,
which
prohibit
the
longshoreman,
or
any
injured
worker,
from
suing
a
third-party
who
may
have
negligently
caused
his
injury
for
full
damages.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
they
all
prohibit
an
employee
from
suing
his
own
employer.
that's
the
nature
of
workmen's
compensation,
as
your
honor--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
a
substitute
for
a
lawsuit
against
the
employer.
it
does
not
substitute
for
a
lawsuit
against
a
third
party.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
encouraging
litigation,
if
i
may
say
so
respectfully.
if
a
person
is
injured
by
virtue
of
negligence
of
some
individual
or
company,
he
always
has
had
the
right
under
common
law
to
sue
that
individual
to
recover
full
compensatory
damages.
the
compensation
law
wasn't
meant
to
limit
an
injured
man's
rights.
it
was
meant
to
give
him
something
in
addition.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
it
was
meant
--
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
yes,
that
is
correct.
a
judgment
was
made
by
the
legislatures--i
would
assume
of
every
state--that
it
is
better
for
the
individual
to
get
some
recovery
quickly,
and
to
insulate
the
employer
from
being
sued,
than
it
was
to
have
the
employer
be
sued
by
the
individual.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
that
is
better
for
society
as
a
whole.
but
the
legislature
--
the
legislature
of
no
state
that
i
know
of
has
taken
away
the
common
law
right
to
sue
a
third
party.
because
why
should
that
third
party,
who
pays
no
premiums
to
the
workmen's
compensation
carrier,
who
gives
nothing,
be
allowed
to
injure
someone
and
get
off,
totally
scot
free?
the
statute
just
doesn't
--
it
allows
that
common
law
right.
mr.
alan
c.
rassner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
apologize.
