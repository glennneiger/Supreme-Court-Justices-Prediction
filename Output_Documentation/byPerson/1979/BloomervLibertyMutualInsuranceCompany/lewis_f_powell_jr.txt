isn't
that--i
think
that's
very
strange
that
the--after
going
through
this
whole
process
again
in
'72,
they
left
the
lien
to
just
judicial
decision.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
isn't
that
the
source
of
the
lien?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
he's
paid
out
the
money.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he's
paid
out
the
money.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that
helps
solve
your
case
by
saying
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
isn't
gone
at
all
if
there's
going
to
be
a
third-party
recovery.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
the
longshoreman
doesn't
sue,
but
the
employer
does,
then
the
statute
does
determine
--
then
it
does
have
provision
for
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
employer
is
going
to
recover
out
of
the
--
what
he
recovers
from
the
third
party,
he's
going
to
recover
his
attorney's
fee.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
recovery's
going
to
be
cost
--
free
to
him.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
could
i
ask,
we
keep
talking
about
the
stevedore,
but
isn't
it
his
insurance
carrier
that's
on
the
hook?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
third
party.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
not
only
has
the
authority,
but
the
employer
can't
deduct
it
without
getting
that
approval,
can
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
congress
hasn't
written
anything
in
this
area;
i
thought
you
both
agreed
to
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
was
no
contribution.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
--
i
take
it
you've
found
no
trace
in
the
legislative
history
of
any
attention
being
given
to
the
lien?
