justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
an
insured
longshoreman
may
receive
compensation
claims
from
the
stevedore
and
then
bring
a
negligence
action
against
owner
of
the
vessel
on
which
the
injury
occurred.
the
longshoreman's
recovery
from
the
ship
owner
is
subject
to
the
stevedore's
lien
in
the
amount
of
the
compensation
payments.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
stevedore's
lien
must
be
reduced
by
a
proportionate
share
of
the
longshoreman's
expenses
in
obtaining
recovery
from
the
ship
owner
or
whether
the
ship
stevedore
is
instead
entitled
to
be
reimbursed
for
the
full
amount
of
the
compensation
payments.
the
petitioner
was
injured
during
the
course
of
his
employment
as
a
longshoreman
and
received
$17,000
in
compensation
from
the
respondent,
mutual
insurance
company,
the
carrier
of
workers'
compensation
for
petitioner's
employer.
thereafter,
the
petitioner
brought
a
negligence
action
against
the
owner
of
the
vessel
on
which
his
injury
occurred.
petitioner
and
the
ship
owner
settled
for
$60,000
and
respondent
intervened
into
the
action
asserting
that
he
was
entitled
to
full
reimbursement
of
its
compensation
payments.
petitioner
agreed
that
respondent
should
not
receive
all
of
its
compensation
payments
but
that
respondent
should
instead
be
required
to
pay
a
proportionate
share
of
petitioner's
expenses
of
suit
including
attorney's
fees.
petitioner,
a
reason
that
since
part
of
the
recovery
from
the
shipowner
would
be
returned
to
respondent
equity
required
the
respondent
bear
portion
of
the
expenses
of
obtaining
that
recovery.
the
district
court
rejected
petitioner's
argument.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
this
recurring
question
on
which
the
courts
of
appeals
have
divided.
for
reasons
stated
in
detail
in
our
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirmed
the
language
structure
and
history
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
and
say
that
that
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
that
the
stevedore
should
recover
the
full
amount
of
its
compensation
payment
and
that
the
stevedore
should
not
be
required
to
bear
share
of
the
longshoreman's
expenses
of
suit.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
