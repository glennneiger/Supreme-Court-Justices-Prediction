paul
stevens
and?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
comes
out--he
comes
out
not
only
cost-free
but
a
little
ahead
of
the
game.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
he
otherwise
might
not
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
even
if
he
didn't
get
his
attorney's
fee
back,
he
might
want
to
sue,
because
he's
paid
out
a
lot
of
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
sues
to
get
it
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
cheaper
to
get
back
10
than
nothing
at
all.
of
course,
it's
better
to
get
back
17.
and
even
more
if
you
get
back
17
plus
your
attorney's
fees
plus
a
little
extra.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
congress
certainly
didn't
expressly,
or
even
impliedly
--
well,
i'll
say
expressly
--
did
not
attempt
to
overturn
or
to
reject
the
no-allocation
approach
that
the
cases
on
the
books
indicated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
were
cases,
as
you
say,
in
1972
there
were
cases
on
the
books
that
said,
no
allocation
of
the
attorney's
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
congress
made
no
effort
to
reject
that
approach.
even
though
it
did
overturn
ryan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
employer
may
never
sue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he
goes
to
a
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
says,
"gee,
i
don't
think
you
could
ever
recover
more
than
$5,000,
and
frankly,
mister,
my
fee
would
never
warrant
the
time
it
would
take."
so
he
may
never
get
to
sue
anyway.
