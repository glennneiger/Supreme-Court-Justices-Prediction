mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
boeckmann,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
contend
that
the
stevedore
should
be
allowed
to
recoup
its
entire
lien.
and
the
statute,
the
legislative
history,
and
the
construction
by
this
court
since
the
1972
amendments
were
passed
all
point
in
that
direction.
the
statute
that
has
been
mentioned
in
various
questions
brought
up
by
the
court
is
a
remedial
one,
and
it
is
the
result
of
political
forces
in
the
congress.
the
employers
resisted
for
quite
some
time
an
increase
in
benefits
under
the
statute,
and
the
benefits
were
quite
low
up
until
1972
because
they
were
being
hit
both
ways
up
until
that
time
by
virtue
of
the
seas
shipping
and
the
ryan
decision.
so
that
the
employer
usually
wound
up
as
a
third
party
paying
both
compensation
and
being
hit
with
a
judgment
or
settlement
for
liability,
after
having
been
in
pleaded
by
the
shipowner.
as
a
result
of
negotiation
in
the
legislative
process,
the
longshoring
companies,
the
stevedoring
companies,
agreed
to
an
increase
in
benefits,
but
as
price
for
that
increase,
they
were
to
be
insulated
from
being
impleaded
in
these
third-party
actions.
and--but
because
of
the
power
of
the
longshoremen's
union,
congress
saw
fit
as
part
of
the
compromise
package
to
allow
the
stevedores,
the
longshoremen-employees,
to
bring
third-party
actions.
but
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
and
you
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
statute
itself,
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
is
intended
to
be
a
compensation
statute,
and
the
third
party
recovery
aspect
of
it
is
given
a
lesser
degree
of
attention.
the--for
one
thing,
as
i
mentioned,
the
benefits
are
quite
high.
they
are
200
percent
of
the
average
national
weekly
wage,
and
they
are
computed
annually
in
order
to
adjust
for
inflation.
whenever
an
attorney
is
involved
in
the
compensation
portion
of
securing
payment,
the
deputy
commissioner
of
labor
is
empowered
to
oversee
any
fees
that
are
awarded
to
the
attorney.
and
it
is
usually
only
in
the
case
of
a
contest
over
the
amount
of
compensation,
and
that
the
employer
turns
out
to
be
wrong
in
resisting,
that
an
attorney
is
awarded
a
fee;
and
only
on
the
excess
that
he
brings
to
his
client
as
a
result
of
that
contest.
and
in
all
cases,
the
deputy
commissioner
is
empowered
to
look
at
the
fees
awarded
to
attorneys.
all
of
this
seems,
to
my
mind,
manifestly
intended
to
preserve
the
employer's
assets
for
the
payment
of
compensation.
and,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
statute
itself
lays
out
a
very
specific
formula
for
if
the
employer
wishes
to
recoup
his
compensation
lien,
encouraging
him
to
do
so,
awarding
him
not
only
the
fee,
but
his
expenses,
his
attorneys'
fees,
and
a
portion
of
any
excess
over
this
amount.
the
--
i
would
also
like
to
address
myself
to
the
equity
of
this
particular
situation.
it
is
argued
that
equity
would
not
--
does
not
permit
the
recovery
of
a
fund
without
rewarding
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
securing
that
fund.
but
it
seems
to
me
applying
it
to
this
kind
of
situation,
it
is
--
you
have
to
go
one
step
deeper.
namely,
that
the
attorney
did
not
create
the
fund,
the
fund
that
consists
of
the
compensation
lien.
the
compensation
lien
is
there
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
compensation
has
been
paid.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes,
i
am,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes,
it
is
there;
like
a
mortgage
on
a
house,
in
the
sale
of
the
house.
it
is
there.
and
whether
or
not
a
suit
will
be
brought,
an
attorney
or
a
claimant
will
have
to
look--he
will
have
to
consider
that
fact
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
has
a
viable
suit.
and
there
is
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
there
is
no
such
provision.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
then,
when
there
is
a
contest
between
employer
and
employee
within
the
context
of
the
compensation
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
--
then
there
is
an
attorney's
fee
allowed,
yes.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes,
but
that
is
not
--
has
no
reference
to
the
third-party
action.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes,
it
does.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes,
the
commissioner
does
supervise
that.
and
the
act
provides--the
act
contemplates,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
employee,
the
injured
employee,
can
proceed
in
compensation
without
an
attorney.
it
is
only
where
there
is
some
kind
of
contest,
and
he
chooses
to
employ
an
attorney,
and
as
a
result,
wins
the
contest,
that
he
is--achieves
his
attorney's
fees.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
i
don't
know
what
the
actual
practice
--
day-to-day
practice
is
before
the
deputy
commissioner.
but
the
act
provides
for
it.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes,
it
does.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes.
but
he
has
authority
to
check
into
its
reasonableness.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
the
--
when
the
employer
sues
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
the
third
party
--
he
is
entitled
to
recover
his
lien,
and
he
is
entitled
to
an
attorney's
fee
out
of
the
recovery.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes.
and
the
deputy
commissioner
has
the
authority
to
approve
the
reasonableness
of
that
fee.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
i
believe
that's
true,
yes.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
defy
logic
to
say
that
if
the
employer
is
entitled
to
a
fee
in
that
situation,
he
is
not
entitled
to
--
he
is
required
to
pay
a
fee
where
the
employee
sues.
and
also,
the
employer
really
has
to
take
a
back
seat
for
the
first
six
months,
because
the
employee
has
the
primary
option
of
proceeding
during
the
first
six
months.
and
therefore,
you
really
would
penalize
the
employer
by
requiring
him
to
pay
a
fee.
and
as
you
pointed
out
before,
mr.
justice
white,
the
paying
these
fees,
and
not
being
able
to
recoup
the
full
compensation
lien,
does
diminish
the
resources
of
the
employer.
it
may,
in
the
instance
of
an
individual
employee,
have
him
wind
up
with
a
greater
recovery.
but
that
is
at
the
expense
of
the
other
injured
employees
who
don't
have
recourse
to
a
third
party
action,
where
the
accident,
for
example,
is
due
100
percent
to
the
longshoreman's
own
negligence.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes,
but
fees
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
but
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes.
but
in
effect,
the
insurance
premium
payment,
the
higher
payments,
come
out
of
the
employer's
pocket.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
and
if
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
higher
insurance
premiums,
he
may
have
to
shrink
his
business,
or
employ
less
employees.
so
that
it
is
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes,
yes.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
and
it
is
--
it
winds
up
being
a
tax
on
the
economy,
which
we
--
my
contention
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
occur
in
this
case.
it
--
i
would
also
like
to
suggest
that
it's
part
of
my
equitable
argument
here
that
inevitably
in
a
court
is
to
look
into
the
amount,
the
pro
rata
allocation
of
an
attorney's
fee
out
of
the
lien
recovery,
that
the
stevedore
employer
will
inevitably
be
drawn
into
the
litigation;
he
will
have
to
appear
in
court;
he
will
have
to
argue
for
a
maximum
recovery.
and
the
statute
itself
appears
to
me
to
contemplate
keeping
the
stevedore
employer
out
of
court
as
much
as
possible.
inevitably,
if
a
judge
has
the
authority
over
dispensing
of
the
proceeds
of
the
funds,
there's
going
to
be
--
the
stevedore
is
going
to
be
involved
in
the
settlement
negotiations,
the
drawing
up
of
a
settlement
package.
the
shipowner
contributes
so
much,
the
stevedore
employer
to
reduce
his
lien,
or
even
perhaps
to
make
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
because
normally
the
accident
happens
aboard
ship.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
generally,
it's
my
experience
that
shipowners
are
insured
by
p&i
clubs,
which
are
generally
foreign
insurance
companies.
and
most
stevedoring
companies
are
insured
by
domestic
companies.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
they
are
--
they
are
usually
adversaries.
and
if
the
shipowner
sees
a
potential
partner
for
contribution
to
settlement,
he
will
look
in
that
direction.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
congress,
by
using
the
language
that
the
employer
shall
not
be
liable
directly
or
indirectly,
intended
to
obviate
this
very
thing.
and
if
this
court
approves
the
allocation,
pro
rata
allocation,
of
the
attorney's
fee
out
of
the
lien,
as
petitioner
argues
for,
it
is
going
to
mean
an
indirect
payment,
some
way
or
other,
by
the
employer.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
the--the
two
recent
cases
decided
by
this
court
on
the
1970--the
1972
amendment
to
the
act,
the
edmonds
case
and
the
director,
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs
v.
rasmussen,
in
which
the
court
was
called
upon
to
review
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
1972
amendments.
and
in
both
instances
this
court,
a
majority,
took
the
position
that
the
court
should
not
rewrite
what
congress
had
set
forth.
in
the
edmonds
case,
it
was
a
question
of
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
well,
i
agree
with
that.
but
congress,
it
seems
to
me,
took
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
1972
amendments
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
that's
right;
which
was
no
pro
rata
allocation.
and
congress,
by
not
addressing
this
issue
whatever
in
the
statute,
intended
that
the
law
remain
the
same.
and
in
essence,
that
was
really
the
issue
in
the
edmonds
case.
and
this
--
the
majority
of
this
court
took
the
position
that
since
congress
did
not
address
the
issue
in
the
remedial
legislation,
the
congress
intended
that
the
law
continue
to
be
the
same;
and
this
court
should
not
rewrite
it.
in
--
also
in,
a
lesser
extent,
in
the
rasmussen
case,
the
court
decided
that
since
congress
did
not
speak
on
an
issue
of
a
limitation
on
death
benefits,
that
the
court
was
not
going
to
rewrite
what
congress
did
not
address.
i
think
the
same--the
court
should
take
the
same
position
here,
inasmuch
as
congress
intended
to
enact
a
remedial
statute.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
i
have
found
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
i
have
found--i
would
like
to
have
found
something,
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
have
found
not
a
word.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
i
found
not
a
word
one
way
or
the
other.
but
my
feeling
is,
also,
that
congress
perhaps
didn't
address
this
issue
at
all
because
it
really
didn't
want
to
tie
the
hands
of
the
court
in
making
an
allocation
where
the
recovery
was
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
both
the
attorney's
fee
and
the
lien.
and
we
do
not
argue
that
the
court--that
by
affirming
the
second
circuit
here
today
that
the
court
would
establish
a
rigid
rule
that
there
would
still
be
room
under
the
cases
for
a
court
to
fashion
an
allocation
where
there
was
not
a
sufficient
third
party
recovery
to
satisfy
both
the
lien
and
the
attorney's
fee
out
of
the
recovery.
and
that
was
considered
in
the--some
of
the
cases
that
were
cited
pre-'72
law
was
that,
yes,
when
there
wasn't
enough,
that
there
could
be
a
solution
worked
out.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes.
pre-'72,
there--at
a
certain
point,
until
there
was--the
stevedore's
lien
came
first
out
of
the
recovery,
and
then
the
attorney's
fee.
after--there
are
some
cases--after
1972,
which
reversed
the
process,
the
attorney's
fee
is
paid,
then
the
lien.
and
we
contend
that
that
is
a
sufficient
accommodation
to
the
1972
amendments,
and
this
court
doesn't
need
to
go
further
in
further
readjusting,
because
of
the
change
in
situation
wrought
by
the
1972
amendments.
and
it
doesn't
have
to
go
to
the
extent
of
pro
rata
allocation.
and
also,
we
contend
that
it
would
be
a
burden
for
the
courts
and
for
the
employer,
in
each
case,
to
have
to
have
a
hearing
as
suggested
by
the
court
in
mitchell,
i
believe
the
fifth
circuit
case;
because
that
again
would
draw
the
stevedore-employer
into
court
unnecessarily,
requiring
him
to
employ
a
lawyer
to
defend
his
right
to
the
lien
recovery.
and
we
contend
that
it
should
be
an
automatic
rule
which
would
--
which
if
this
court
affirms
the
second
circuit,
would
mean
that
the
employer
would,
in
every
case
where
there
is
sufficient
funds
available,
pay
the
attorney's
fee
and
the
lien,
that
that
would
mean
that
the
stevedore-employer
would
automatically,
without
a
hearing,
without
law,
recoup
the
entire
workmen's
compensation
lien.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes.
i
believe
the
valentino
there
was
sufficient.
but
in
a
case
where
there
was
--
there
isn't
sufficient
to
cover
both,
the
courts
would
still
have
a
free
hand
to
make
an
allocation.
but
only
in
that
kind
of
situation.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
there
--
the
--
the
amicus
brief.
i
believe
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
--
suggests
that
there
be
a
distinction
made
where
there
is
a
settlement
with
out
the
employer's
permission
as
opposed
to
one
that
was
made
with
the
employer's
permission.
and
that
--
because
the
settlement
made
without
the
employer's
permission
cuts
off
any
right
to
future
compensation
payments;
whereas
one
with
the
employer's
permission,
the
deputy
commissioner
is
first
required
to
ascertain
any
future
liability
for
compensation.
and
--
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
i
don't
join
the
amicus
in
that.
i
feel
that
the
rule
should
be
uniform,
whenever
there
is
a
third
party
recovery.
mr.
douglas
a.
boeckmann
yes,
that
is
our
position.
thank
you.
