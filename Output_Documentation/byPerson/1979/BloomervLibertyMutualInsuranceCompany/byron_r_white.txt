justice

of
course,
that
argument
is--that
argument
rejects
the
notion
that
the
stevedore,
the
employer
was
intended
to
be,
by
congress,
to
be
completely
free
of
any
kind
of
liability
in
connection
with
third-party
actions.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
you
don't
think
so.
but
there's
an
argument
that
compensation
benefits
were
increased
substantially
in
exchange
for
immunizing
the
employer
from
any
kind
of
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
connection
with
third-party
actions.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
way,
is
there
something
in
the
statute
that
says
that
the
employer
is
entitled
to
get
back
his
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
statutory
--
his
payment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
got
the
17
one
way
or
another,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
taken
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
his
attorney's
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
he
otherwise
might
not
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
stevedore
sues,
he's
suing
his
customer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
may
have
to
--
may
have
to
make
some
kind
of
a
judgment
about
whether
to
sue
at
all
like
most
people
do,
whether
it's
worthwhile
to
sue.
and
it
may
be
he'll
just
decide
to
leave
it
to
the
--
leave
it
to
his
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
may
just
decide
to
leave
it
to
his
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
going
to
be
subject
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
$10,000?
i
may
only
recover
$10,000.
i'll
owe
my
attorney
so
much,
and
i'll
owe
the
--
i'll
have
to
pay
my
benefits
back.
it
isn't
worth
the
effort.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
right
is
there,
but
you
don't
particularly
want
to
encourage
lawsuits
that
are
not
going
to
benefit
the
economy
as
a
whole.
i
mean,
just
--
the
only
beneficiary
of
your
hypothetical
case,
really,
is
the
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
still
true
in
your
hypothetical
that
using
the
example
the
chief
justice
put
to
you,
the
longshoreman
would
come
out
about
the
same
as
if
there'd
never
been
any
compensation
statute;
the
$10,000,
he'd
get
a
net
of
about
$6,000
out
of
the
recovery.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
gets
the
benefit
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
--
i
suppose
the
result
of
this
case
may
affect
the
employer's
insurance
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
the
employer's
insurance
company
is
getting
back
full
recovery
by
one
rule,
and
wouldn't
be
getting
back
full
recovery
in
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event,
his
doing
business
costs
him
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
a
state
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
there
some
state
systems?
are
there
some
state
funds,
or
is
it
all
private
insurance
coverage?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
never
operate
through
any
state
insurance
firms?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
and
so
the
state
insurance
fund
is,
or
is
not,
going
to
get
full
recovery;
under
your
rule,
they
won't.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
rule
would
tend
to
deplete
the
state
funds.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
that
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
but
it
does
provide
for
the
payment
of
attorney's
fee
to
the
employee
in
certain
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
commissioner
supervises
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
in
every
case?
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
in
every
case?
or
does
the
commissioner
have
some
discretion
to
say,
"well,
in
this
case,
it
was
pretty
close,
and
while
you
did
prevail,
i'm
not
going
to
allow
attorney's
fees."
justice
byron
r.
white
authorizes
him
to
award
attorney's
fees
to
the
claimant?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
the
employer
sues
the
third
party
and
recovers,
and
wants
an
attorney's
fee,
the
commissioner
must
approve
that,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
certainly
i
--
what
was
the
--
will
you
tell
us
again
what
you
just
told
my
brother?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
out
of
the
award,
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
required
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
--
all
that
requires
is
higher
insurance
premiums.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
employee
--
no
other
employee
really's
going
to
not
get
his
compensation
payments.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
that
they're
going
to
be
more
costly
to
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
lower
wages?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
not
increase
them
as
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
the
most
frequent
third
party
defendant
is
a
shipowner?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
these
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
know,
is
it
characteristic
that
the
same
insurance
companies
may
be
insuring
shipowners
as
who
insure
stevedores,
or
do
they
specialize?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
then
--
there's
a
fight
between
a
certain
kind
--
one
kind
of
insurance
company
and
another
kind
of
insurance
company
in
these
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
making
any
kind
of
a
specific
provision
for
a
lien
which
just
rests
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
it's
in
your
favor.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
was
enough,
no
allocation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
suggest
a
different
rule
might
be
applicable
where
the
recovery
did
not
reach
the
amount
of
the
compensation
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
valentino
case,
which
was
recognized,
i
gather,
by
the
second
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
also
suggested
in
the
briefs,
at
least,
that
there
might
be
some
different
rule
where
there's
a
settlement
from
what
the
rule
would
be
where
there
was
a
recovery
against
a
third
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
the
amicus
brief,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
submission,
is
that
a
valid
distinction?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
recovery
against
a
third
party
is
either
by
way
of
recovery
or
by
way
of
a
negotiated
settlement?
