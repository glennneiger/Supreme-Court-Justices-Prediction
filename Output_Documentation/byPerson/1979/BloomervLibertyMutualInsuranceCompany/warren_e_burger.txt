chief
justice

e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
bloomer
against
liberty
mutual.
mr.
rassner,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
hypothetical
question
how
much
net
would
this
man
get
now?
he
got
60
gross,
17
from
the
liberty
mutual,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
23
net
after
the
lawsuit
was
over,
is
that
right?
17
and
23?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
started
with
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
got
17
in
installments
while
he
was
litigating
and
getting
well
in
the
hospital.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
he
got
23
net
after
he
finished
his
lawsuit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
there'd
been
no
statute
at
all,
and
he
was
just
suing
on
common
law
negligence.
and
he
sued
--
which
is
what
he
was
doing
here
--
he
sued,
and
got
$60,000.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
--
he's
exactly
in
the
same
position
as
he
would
have
been
without
any
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
one
way
of
putting
it.
but
he
winds
up
in
each
of
the
situations
i've
described
with
precisely
$40,000
in
his
pocket,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
justice
white
just
pointed
out,
there's
nothing
in
the
compensation
statute
that
tells
us
that
this
cost
should
be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
gets
these
medical
benefits,
and
installments,
monthly
or
weekly
installments,
right
away,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
he
doesn't
have
to
go
out
and
borrow
money
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
the
figures
--
the
hypothetical
figures
i
gave
you,
he's
much
much
better
off
than
that.
he's
got
$40,000,
hasn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
got
$40,000
on
the
hypothetical
that
i
gave
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
or
without
this
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
your
$10,000
case,
you're
talking
about
two-thirds
of
the
attorney's
fee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
all
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wagner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
excuse
me,
mr.
boeckmann.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
speaking
now
of
the
$17,000?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
took
no
lawyer
to
produce
that
fund?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgement
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
bloomer
versus
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
