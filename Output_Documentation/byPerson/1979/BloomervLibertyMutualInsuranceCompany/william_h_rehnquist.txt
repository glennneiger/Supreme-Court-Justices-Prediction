but
most
compensation
statutes
are
enacted
as
substitutes
for
an
ordinary
negligence
action,
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
against
the
man's
own
employer.
isn't
the
origin
of
workmen's
compensation
the
idea
that
the
man
would
get
a
fixed,
quick,
well-established
and
easily
recoverable
recovery
against
his
employer
rather
than
having
to
sue
for
negligence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
an
element
of
expressio
unius
in
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
an
element
of
expressio
unius
in
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
has
made
very
specific
provision
for
what
shall
happen
when
a
stevedore
sues,
and
all
of
the
consequences
which
you
have
described;
and
it
has
made
none
for
the
apportionment
of
attorney's
fees
when
the
longshoreman
sues.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rassner,
what
if
the
longshoreman
has
a
medical
policy
of
his
own,
so
that
a
good
deal
of
hospital
costs
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
--
come
from
a
collateral
source?
now,
isn't
--
may
there
not
be
an
occasion
where
the
longshoreman
is
motivated
to
sue
not
by
his
own
desire
to
recover,
but
by
his
own
insurer's
desire
to
recover
as
subrogee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
depends
on
whether
a
state
follows
a
collateral
source
doctrine.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
not
only
tend,
it
would.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
can't
you
extend
that
statement
you
just
made
still
further?
if
the
1972
amendments
just,
as
a
general
matter,
tended
to
cut
down
on
the
number
of
lawsuits
that
there
were
in
this
area.
and
in
that
sense,
the
very
notion
of
a
third-party
action
is
--
runs
contrary
to
the
notion
of
a
compensation
system.
we
have
them
both
in
the
statute,
but
they
point
in
two
alternative
legal
theories.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
perfectly
possible
that
you
could
have
a
system
of
workmen's
compensation
which
authorized
no
third-party
actions
whatever;
there
wouldn't
be
any
lawsuits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
most
of
them
prohibit
an
employee
from
suing
his
own
employer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
substitute
for
a
lawsuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
there
any
reason,
as
suggested
by
my
brother
stevens,
to
encourage
in
any
way
additional
litigation
in
this
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
common
law,
he
has
the
right
to
sue
his
own
employer
for
negligence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
compensation
law
removed
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
better
for
both,
and
probably
better
for
society
as
a
whole.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
also
when
the
employee
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
