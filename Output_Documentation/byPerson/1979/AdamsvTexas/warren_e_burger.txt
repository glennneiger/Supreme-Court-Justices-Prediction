chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
adams
v.
texas.
mr.
bruder,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
suggesting
that
there
is
a
gray
zone
of
some
kind
here
where
a
juror,
a
prospective
juror
might
be
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
was
involved
or,
on
the
other
hand,
might
not
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
the
right
case,
taking
that
phrase,
does
that
mean
the
right
case
as
he
sees
it
or
the
right
case
as
within
the
framework
of
the
instructions
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
apply
that
to
juror
white
who
was
examined
in
the
appendix
at
the
upper
pages,
20,
25,
27,
somewhere
in
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
he
have
a
little
more
there?
juror
white
said,
"i
think
i
believe
in
capital
punishment,
but
i
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
is
that
clear?"
those
are
all
his
words.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
suggest
that
he
doesn't
want
to
impose
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
look
at
his
answer
at
the
bottom
of
page
27
and
the
question
and
his
answer
at
the
top
of
page
28.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
last
answer
of
the
juror
that
you
have
just
referred
to,
juror
white
said
it
would
probably
affect
me
in
my
deliberations,
and
then
the
judge
said
would
it
be
fair
then
to
say
that
you
cannot
give
us
your
assurance
that
you
would
not
be
affected
by
the
punishment
of
life
or
death
in
deliberating
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
that
is
correct,
the
juror
said.
that
is
correct.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
you
should
force
a
juror
to
say
no.
i
will
not
be
truthful?
this
is
a
little
bit
like
a
lot
of
the
polling
process,
the
answer
is
determined
by
the
question
if
you
put
it
the
way
you
put
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
he
belong
on
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
think
that
has
to
be
developed
with
any
juror,
that
he
is
going
to
treat
a
death
case
differently
from
a
petty
theft
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
do
you
think
that
needs
to
be
developed
the
way
you
suggest
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
interpret
the
answers
as
merely
expressing
a
heightened
sensitivity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
then
is
that
for
the
federal
law
purposes,
a
decision
here
in
your
favor
does
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
basic
conviction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
is
only
because
of
the
texas
law
quirk
that
it
does.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
becker.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
standing,
i
take
it,
on
how
the
statute
was
applied
in
each
case
in
relation
to
the
questions
put
and
the
answers
given.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
really
can't
escape
the
proposition
that
was
put
to
you
that
affect
might
mean
something
quite
different
from
what
it
does
in
the
specific
cases
set
out
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
bruder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
problem
be
cured,
mr.
bruder,
if
the
judge
on
his
own
had
instructed
the
jury
that
when
i
describe
the
statute
to
you,
using
the
word
"affect,"
what
is
meant
by
that
is
that
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty
will
not
lead
me
to
vote
not
guilty
in
a
case
which
i
might
otherwise
vote
guilty,
would
that
take
care
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
defining
"affect"
at
least
as
the
judge
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
the
court
decided
that
the
questions
and
the
answers
taken
together
showed
that
each
of
the
jurors
questioned
understood
that
meaning
of
the
word
"affect"
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
know
if
it
could
either,
but
suppose
the
court
did
--
is
the
court
free
to
make
this
evaluation
on
the
basis
of
how
the
juror
answered
the
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
is
that
we
should
go
with
you
and
force
the
state
of
texas
to
amend
its
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
