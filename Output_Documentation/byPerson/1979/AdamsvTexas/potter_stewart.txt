it
held
that
jurors
could
not
be
excluded
for
cause
on
anything
less
than
what
was
defined
in
witherspoon.
justice
potter
stewart
but
witherspoon
didn't
involve
how
it
would
affect
their
guilt
or
innocence
vote,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
but
it
didn't
say
that
it
was
wrong
to
exclude
the
juror
if
he
conceded
that
it
might
make
him
more
likely
to
vote
for
innocence.
justice

way.
it
said

prevent
him
from
making
an
impartial
decision.
justice

some
people
that
witherspoon
would
not.
which
way
would
it
do,
both?
justice
potter
stewart
and
witherspoon
would
say,
as
it
did
say,
it
could
not
be
eliminated
from
the
jury
for
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
he
is
if
he
is
the
defendant's
brother,
too.
justice
potter
stewart
witherspoon
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
that.

explained
the
meaning
of
the
word
"affect"?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
"affect"
in
1231(b)?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
"affect"
means
impair
or
distort?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
a
verb
so
it
means
impair
or
distort
or
bias
or
excuse.
justice
potter
stewart
we
called
for
the
records?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
so
far
as
you
know,
no
other
state
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
1231(b)
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
was
reconsidered
and
readopted,
most
recently
enacted
after
the
establishment
in
texas
of
the
legislative
system
that
was
approved
in
the
jurek
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
jurek
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
an
historical
survival
from
an
earlier
day.
