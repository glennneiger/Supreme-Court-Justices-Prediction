mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
the
right
of
a
state
to
exclude
prospective
jurors
from
a
capital
case
solely
because
of
their
attitudes
or
feelings
about
the
death
penalty.
by
statute,
that
is
section
1231(b)
of
the
texas
penal
code,
texas
in
our
opinion
has
impermissibly
broadened
the
base
of
exclusion
beyond
the
parameters
established
by
the
witherspoon
doctrine.
and
to
the
extent
that
witherspoon
does
not
allow
the
exclusion
of
any
juror
because
of
personal
feelings
about
the
death
penalty,
unless
there
is
unmistakable
irrevocable
commission
on
the
part
of
the
prospective
juror
to
vote
against
death,
1231(b)
impedes
upon
witherspoon
to
the
extent
that
it
allows
the
exclusion
of
the
juror
for
a
reason
less
than
that
described
in
witherspoon.
as
proof
of
our
position,
we
submit
that
any
time
a
juror
is
qualified
under
witherspoon
and
says
i
can
in
a
proper
case
and
under
the
right
circumstances
vote
death,
whenever
such
a
juror
is
excluded
under
state
law
solely
because
of
the
juror's
feelings
about
capital
punishment,
the
juror
is
excluded
on
a
broader
basis
than
provided
in
witherspoon.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i'm
suggesting
that
as
long
as
the
juror
is
willing
to
state
"i
can
vote
death
in
the
right
case,"
that
juror
is
qualified
vis-a-vis
his
feelings
about
the
death
penalty.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
it
means
the
right
case
under
the
evidence
within
the
framework
of
the
instructions
given
by
the
court
and
as
he
views
the
facts,
because
he
is
a
personal
representative
of
the
community
and
it
is
he
who
must
express
the
community
conscience.
and
under
the
guarded
jury
discretions,
that
is
specifically
provided
for
under
the
texas
capital
punishment
scheme.
the
jury
has
the
discretion
to
utilize
what
evidence
and
facts
is
made
available,
and
by
answering
the
three
questions,
knowing
what
the
effect
of
those
answers
explicitly
is,
the
jury
exercises
that
community
conscience.
thus,
witherspoon
requires
that
that
base
defined
in
witherspoon
apply
to
jury
selection
in
the
state
of
texas.
now,
the
state
has
constructed
a
theoretical
model
upon
which
it
hopes
to
convince
this
court
that
1231(b)
stands
for
a
proposition
that
even
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
disowned.
the
state
argues
and
agrees
with
us
that
witherspoon
does
apply
in
texas.
i
take
that
to
dispose
of
question
number
one
under
the
grant
of
cert.
so
we
go
to
the
next
question,
and
the
state
argues
that
witherspoon
is
not
violated
in
this
case
and
theoretically
in
any
other
case
in
texas
because
the
real
purpose
of
1231(b)
is
to
exclude
those
jurors
who
are
affected
to
the
extent
that
they
will
allow
their
personal
feelings
to
influence
their
vote,
and
that
is
not
what
1231(b)
says
and
that
is
not
what
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
construed
1231(b)
to
say.
in
fact,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
said
just
the
opposite.
a
juror
who
states
under
oath
"i
will
answer
the
questions
honestly,
i
will
answer
the
three
punishment
questions
truthfully,
i
will
put
aside
whatever
reservations
i
may
have
about
capital
punishment
when
i
answer
those
three
questions,"
that
does
not
rehabilitate
a
prospective
juror
who
has
already
said
"i
will
be
affected
by
the
existence
of
the
death
penalty
in
this
case."
so
clearly
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
rejected
what
this
court
suggested
could
exist
in
lockett
v.
ohio,
that
is
that
it
is
fair
to
excuse
from
jury
service
any
prospective
juror
who
says
"i
can't
follow
the
law,"
and
witherspoon
pretty
much
said
the
same
thing.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
juror
white
specifically
qualified
under
witherspoon
on
page
26
in
our
opinion.
he
was
then
asked
on
page
27,
"may
i
from
your
answers
--
are
you
saying
that
this
mandatory
sentence
of
death
or
life
would
affect
your
deliberations
on
the
issues
of
fact
in
the
case
including
those
three
questions"
--
"yes,
sir."
and
then
if
you
go
on
to
pages
28
and
29
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
it
may
suggest
it,
but
i
think
that
juror
white
was
not
absolutely
disqualified
under
witherspoon.
juror
white
never
indicated
that
there
would
be
an
automatic
vote
against
death,
and
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
it
is
still
equivocal.
and
the
important
thing
is
that,
on
the
one
hand,
the
state
says
in
its
brief
we
really
don't
have
to
concern
ourselves
about
the
ultimate
issue
because
the
juror
writes
yes
answers
or
no
answers
and
it
is
the
judge
who
sets
the
punishment.
and
at
the
same
time
juror
white
says
--
"could
you
set
aside
your
feelings
and
vote
for
the
death
penalty,
either
directly
or
indirectly?"
"i
guess
i
could.
i
guess
i
could."
"you
have
to.
you
have
to
vote
the
question,
the
answers
to
the
questions
honestly,
irregardless
of
what
you
think
the
penalty
should
be.
do
you
think
you
can
do
that?"
"yes."
"if
the
facts
and
circumstances
justified
it?"
so
under
state
theory
number
one,
juror
white
is
eminently
qualified.
but
under
state
theory
number
two,
which
is
inconsistent
with
number
one,
juror
white
is
not
qualified
and
it
is
difficult
from
an
analysis
of
their
positions
to
determine
which
theory
it
is
that
they
want
this
court
to
apply.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
yes,
sir.
and
the
one
thing
that
we
have
not
addressed
ourselves
to
at
all
in
the
briefs,
perhaps
not
enough
anyway,
is
the
problem
of
the
word
"affect,"
and
it
is
something
which
unfortunately
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
refused
to
address
itself
to.
what
does
the
word
"affect"
mean?
the
statute
doesn't
define
it.
the
courts
won't
define
it.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
appendix
and
a
fair
reading
of
the
voir
dire
examination
in
this
case
clearly
indicates
that
what
happens
is
that
a
prosecutor
defines
it
for
the
juror
before
asking
him
the
critical
question
called
for
by
1231(b).
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
the
court
uses
1231(b)
in
violation
of
witherspoon
or
whether
it
is
the
prosecutor.
it
is
the
defendant
who
is
injured
by
a
violation
of
witherspoon,
and
just
as
in
witherspoon
itself,
it
was
the
court
who
wholesale
excluded
jurors
that
voiced
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
does
it
rest
on
that?
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
most
assuredly.
juror
white
has
not
said
anything
which
prevents
juror
white
from
performing
her
duties
under
texas
law
as
a
juror
in
a
capital
case,
unless
you
accept
the
validity
of
1231(b)
as
being
the
end-all
question
to
test
the
qualification
of
a
juror.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
it
hurts
me.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
that
brings
the
case
within
lockett,
where
the
juror
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
they
would.
they
clearly
would.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
think
they
are
inconsistent
and
i
think
the
only
solution
is
the
same
solution
that
the
fifth
circuit
proposed
in
burns
v.
estelle,
there
must
be
continuing
inquire
rate
of
that
juror
to
attempt
to
find
out
which
of
the
inconsistent
positions
is
the
strong
position.
but
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
juror
white?
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
wasn't
the
last
juror.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
yes.
now,
our
position
on
1231(b)
is
that
to
statutorily
codify.
a
single
question
which
can
be
used
to
satisfy
the
witherspoon
standard,
but
it
doesn't
go
for
enough.
what
it
should
do
is
define
affect.
what
it
should
do
is
come
up
with
a
second
question
or
a
second
phrase,
as
suggested
by
mr.
justice
white,
will
this
affect
your
deliberations
to
the
extent
that
you
will
not
vote
honestly,
that
you
will
not
follow
the
law,
that
you
will
not
be
truthful.
if
1231(b)
said
that
or
if
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
elected
to
construe
1231(b)
that
way,
then
i
think
our
position
would
be
far,
far
weaker.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
think
the
answers
are
determined
by
the
questions
in
the
voir
dire
examination
in
this
case,
very
clearly,
because
if
you
have
a
person
on
the
witness
stand
on
voir
dire
examination,
the
pattern
is
the
same
in
all
of
these
cases,
not
only
in
the
adams
case
but
in
all
of
them.
mr.
or
mrs.
juror,
what
is
your
feeling
about
the
death
penalty?
i
have
some
reservations
about
it.
i
know
that
the
law
provides
for
it,
but
i
permanently
dont
want
to
be
involve
well
all
law
provide
that
you
have
to
this
question.
now
taking
into
account
your
personal
feelings
against
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
the
fact
that
you
would
not
really
want
to
participate
in
the
decision-making
process
leading
to
the
taking
of
a
man's
life,
can
you
state
under
oath
that
that
will
not
affect
your
deliberations?
i
don't
think
any
self-searching
person
is
going
to
say
anything
but,
of
course
it
will
affect
my
deliberations.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
without
knowing
what
that
person
means,
he
certainly
is
not
subject
to
exclusion,
whether
or
not
he
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
no,
i
think
the
voir
dire
examination
shows
that
a
number
of
the
veniremen
questioned
interpreted
the
word
"effect"
to
mean
a
heightened
sensitivity
to
the
case.
i
would
want
to
be
sure.
in
other
words,
i
am
not
going
to
treat
this
as
a
petty
theft
case.
this
is
a
capital
case.
we
are
talking
about
a
man's
life.
and
i
take
this
to
be
a
heightened
sensitivity
situation
where
i
am
going
to
respond
carefully.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
do
i
think
it
has
to
be
developed?
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
yes.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
it
is
the
only
way
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
juror
interprets
the
word
"affect"
as
meaning
heightened
sensitivity
or
interprets
the
word
"affect"
as
meaning
i
can't
follow
the
law.
we
have
no
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
think,
your
honor,
that
mr.
williams
is
a
very
weak
example
of
our
position.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question.
are
you
saying
that
if
the
defense
challenged
for
cause
under
1231(b)?
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
well,
i
don't
think
the
challenge
for
cause
exists
in
the
law.
i
think
1231(b)
provides
for
challenge
for
cause
that
is
unconstitutional
and
it
wouldn't
matter
who
made
the
challenge,
it
would
still
be
a
violation
of
witherspoon.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
certainly,
but
i
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
theoretically
that
is
possible,
but
from
a
practical
standpoint
it
has
never
happened
to
my
knowledge.
it
certainly
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
and
in
the
other
1231(b)
cases
that
have
been
tried
in
texas,
it
hasn't
happened,
according
to
people
who
have
read
those
records
and
advised
me.
it
has
always
been
a
prosecution,
consistently.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
exactly.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
exactly.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
exactly.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
once
they
meet
the
threshold
test,
they
are
allowed
to
go
on
that
jury
and
cannot
be
struck
for
any
reason
which
is
based
upon
their
personal
feelings
about
the
death
penalty.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
yes,
it
did.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
think
the
second
prong
of
the
witherspoon
test
recites
that
unless
it
is
shown
that
the
juror
will
never
vote
for
death
or
that
his
feelings
will
cause
him
to
vote
a
certain
way
on
the
issue
of
guilt-innocence
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
--
he
is
then
subject
to
exclusion.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
an
impartial
decision,
making
him
biased.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
and
what
we
deal
with
in
application
with
respect
to
1231(b)
is
that
in
almost
every
instance
1231(b)
is
aimed
at
the
punishment
questions
and
it
is
used
to
exclude
jurors
who
cannot
vote
death.
it
is
never
used
or
rarely
used
in
regards
to
their
ability
to
fairly
resolve
the
guilt-innocence
issues.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
your
honor,
the
remedy
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
is
to
vacate
the
judgment
insofar
as
it
imposes
the
death
sentence.
under
texas
law
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
right.
we
have
not
argued
and
we
have
not
taken
any
position
that
the
jury
selection
in
this
case
affected
the
guilt-innocence
determination.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
the
texas
court
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
either
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial
or
if
the
governor
elects
to
commute
his
sentence
to
life
then
he
has
no
recourse,
which
has
been
done
in
the
past.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
yes.
under
texas
law,
any
time
punishment
is
assessed
by
a
jury
and
there
is
a
defect
in
the
punishment
process,
the
entire
case
is
reversed
and
it
is
send
back
from
square
one.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
a
high
probability.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
not
inconsistent.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
that's
true.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
there
is
a
very
good
prospect
that
there
would
be.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
historically
following
the
1972
death
penalty
decision,
the
governor
commuted
almost
all
of
the
people
on
death
row.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
right.
that
is,
the
legality
of
that
has
been
challenged
and
has
been
upheld.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
that
is
correct.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
just
briefly.
it
seems
a
shame
to
me
somehow
that
if
both
witherspoon
and
1231(b)
parallel
each
other,
and
the
states
contends
1231(b)
is
fairer
and
the
defendant
contends
that
witherspoon
is
fairer,
that
we
can't
provide
for
an
election
prior
to
trial
and
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
based
on
that
election.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
this
petitioner
does
not
agree
with
the
state
that
1231(b)
is
in
any
sense
of
the
word
fair.
there
are
two
cases
that
i
want
to
particularly
point
out
to
the
court.
counsel
talks
about
we
have
this
word
"affect"
but
we
don't
want
to
define
it,
we
simply
want
to
throw
it
out
there
for
the
jury
to
consider,
tell
them
the
entire
process,
and
then
on
that
basis
let
them
decide
what
they
think
it
means,
and
that
1231(b)
is
fair
because
of
that.
yet,
in
hovila
i,
532
s.w.
2d
294,
former
presiding
judge
morrison
said
that
the
court
will
presume
that
a
juror's
answers
will
be
affected.
the
punishment
answers
will
always
be
affected
by
the
existence
of
a
mandatory
penalty
of
life
or
death.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
are
you
talking
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
you
are
talking
guilt-innocence?
you
are
talking
about
the
guilt-innocence
phase
as
opposed
to
punishment.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
think
that
would
--
that
may
satisfy
the
second
part
of
the
witherspoon
standard
on
guilt-innocence,
and
i
think
a
question
could
be
formulated
to
follow
up
on
1231(b)
that
would
satisfy
the
witherspoon
standard.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
but
we
are
talking
about
such
a
subjective
problem
that
i
can't
see
how
the
court
can
do
that.
i
think
it
would
be
difficult.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
the
court
is
free
to
do
it,
certainly.
i
think
the
court
would
have
difficulty
squaring
that
type
of
a
rule
with
witherspoon
as
well
as
inviting
a
very
tremendous
caseload
and
an
increase
in
its
docket
because
every
death
penalty
case
from
texas
would
then
become
a
case
that
is
automatically
reviewable
by
this
court
on
the
basis
of
1231(b)
versus
witherspoon
violations.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
amend
its
statute
or,
your
honor,
construe
the
statute
which
i
suspect
is
coming
right
around
the
corner.
and
the
other
case
that
i
wanted
to
bring
to
your
attention
is
russell
v.
state,
to
which
counsel
alluded.
the
number
is
63-715.
it
was
delivered
on
march
12,
1980.
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
to
which
counsel
alluded,
he
left
off
a
phrase
that
i
want
to
direct
to
the
court's
attention.
judge
clinton
said,
"witherspoon
is
no
longer
a
viable
measure
of
qualifying
jurors
in
the
bifurcated
proceedings
of
the
capital
case
in
that
they
do
not
directly
assess
punishment
and
that
a
good
deal
more
manifestation
than
merely
acknowledging
the
magic
phrase
of
1231(b)
should
be
required
for
disqualification.
the
record
must
be
made
clear
that
the
juror
understands
the
word
'affect'
to
be
a
synonym
for
bias
for
predisposition
to
vote
in
a
certain
way,
and
then
1231(b)
satisfies
the
witherspoon
standard
and,
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
1231(b)
or
the
texas-witherspoon
procedure,
it
is
constitutional."
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
i
believe
it
was
enacted
as
a
different
penal
code
article
shortly
after
the
furman
decision
readopted
in
the
1974
penal
code.
i
think
it
was
article
673.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
well,
it
was
enacted
along
with
--
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
right.
mr.
melvyn
carson
bruder
it
is
not.
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
jurek
system.
thank
you.
