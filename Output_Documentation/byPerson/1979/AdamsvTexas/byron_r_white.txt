justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
the
last
one
anyway,
wasn't
it,
and
it
was
the
one
that
the
judge
chose
to
believe?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
this
was
the
last
question
of
juror
white.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bruder,
let
me
put
it
another
way.
is
it
your
position
that
1231(b)
will
operate
to
exclude
prospective
witnesses
that
the
witherspoon
rule
would
not
exclude?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bruder,
i
want
to
be
sure
about
one
other
thing.
if
the
court
should
decide
in
your
favor
here,
what
is
the
remedy?
does
it
go
back
for
a
new
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
or
merely
on
sentencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
answered
my
question
only
on
the
sentence
and
not
on
the
basic
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
happen
in
the
texas
court
if
we
cavated
the
death
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
a
new
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
we
just
vacate
the
death
sentence,
there
is
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
that
is
just
a
quirk
of
texas
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
actually
we
would
only
send
it
back
for
further
proceedings,
not
inconsistent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
our
decision,
and
then
it
would
be
up
to
the
texas
courts
to
say
whether
it
is
a
new
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
telling
us
that
the
prospect
is
that
there
would
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
avoids
a
new
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
suggest
that
witherspoon
is
beside
the
point
in
a
sentencing
scheme
such
as
you
have
and
although
you
purport
to
be
following
witherspoon
as
a
parallel
track,
you
really
shouldn't
have
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
that
you
had
to
comply
with
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
either
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
becker,
did
that
juror
serve?
justice
byron
r.
white
general
becker,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
statutory
language.
1231(b)
says
jurors
have
to
be
informed
about
the
death
penalty,
and
then
it
says
a
prospective
juror
shall
be
disqualified
from
serving
as
a
juror
unless
he
states
under
oath
that
the
mandatory
penalty
of
death
or
imprisonment
for
life
will
not
affect
his
deliberations
in
any
issue
of
fact.
suppose
the
juror
is
asked
the
question
in
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
juror
responds
by
saying,
well,
since
it
is
a
death
penalty
i
know
i
would
scrutinize
every
witness
as
closely
as
i
could
and
i
would
think
about
it
a
long
time
before
i
came
to
a
conclusion,
so
the
answer
is
yes,
it
would
affect
my
deliberations.
must
that
juror
be
disqualified?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
statute
plainly
require
his
disqualification
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
answers
the
question
no
and
then
he
explains
his
answer
and
the
statute
requires
--
i
may
have
the
negative
and
the
affirmative
turned
around,
but
in
any
event
if
he
gives
the
wrong
answer
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
says
you
must
be
disqualified.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
then
have
a
problem
with
the
statute
as
it
is
written?
you
want
to
redefine
the
word
"affect"
and
say,
well,
it
really
means
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
that
is
critical
under
the
statute
is
unless
the
prospective
juror
states
under
oath,
and
to
say
that
the
juror
just
can't
do
that
for
the
reason
that
the
juror
interprets
the
word
"affect"
in
the
way
that
most
people
would
interpret
the
word
"effect"
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
never
do.
do
they
ever
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
explained
the
word
"affect"?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
exactly
right.
