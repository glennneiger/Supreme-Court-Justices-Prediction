justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
both
of
the
two
questions
just
asked
you
by
the
chief
justice
were
posed
by
the
court
and
not
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
all
we
had
was
the
colloquy
on
page
28
of
the
appendix,
the
question
by
the
court,
"all
right.
would
it
be
fair
then
to
say
that
you
cannot
give
us
your
assurance
that
you
would
not
be
affected
by
the
punishment
of
life
or
death
in
deliberating
the
fact
issues
in
the
case?
juror
white,
"that's
correct."
did
you
think
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
the
sole
colloquy
that
the
court
had
with
juror
white
or
anybody
else
had
with
juror
white,
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
to
exclude
juror
white
for
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
certainly
wouldn't
have
meant
that
i
would
be
more
likely
to
vote
guilt
because
i
am
opposed
to
the
death
penalty.
he
couldn't
have
meant
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
the
most
likely
meaning
of
affect
the
second
question
that
justice
white
put
to
you
a
moment
ago,
that
it
will
affect
in
favor
of
resolving
doubts
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
that
he
would
not
otherwise
resolve
under
the
judge's
charge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
juror
who
is
asked
on
voir
dire
about
statutory
questions
and
responds
in
favor
of
capital
punishment
but
gives
the
same
sort
of
affect
answers
and
the
defense
challenges
for
cause?
now,
would
you
say
that
the
court
could
turn
down
that
sort
of
a
challenge
because
all
he
meant
was
that
his
sensitivity
was
heightened?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
a
defendant
in
texas
has
challenges
for
cause,
do
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
couldn't
one
of
them
be
based
on
the
way
the
particular
venireman
answered
the
three
questions
in
the
statute
under
consideration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
our
province,
is
it
not,
as
opposed
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
to
have
the
final
say
as
to
whether
a
decision
of
this
court
does
or
does
not
apply
to
a
particular
factual
situation
in
a
state
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
you
have
to
be
arguing
that
in
no
one
case
can
you
comply
with
both?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
concede
i
gather
then
that
1231(b)
would
exclude
some
people
that
witherspoon
would
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we've
just
got
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
think
this
necessarily
means
that
what
she
is
saying,
"i
will
be
affected,"
and
that
means
to
you,
because
of
the
form
of
the
question,
the
context,
that
she
was
saying
that
she
could
not
say
that
she
would
come
to
her
conclusions
based
on
the
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
are
the
records
here?
