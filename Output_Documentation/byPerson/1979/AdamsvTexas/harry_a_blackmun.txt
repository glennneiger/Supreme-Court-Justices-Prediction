justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
becker,
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
the
validity
of
the
conviction
is
not
in
issue,
it
is
just
the
death
penalty
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
problem
with
your
statement
is
that
witherspoon
said
that
jurors
could
not
be
excluded
for
cause
unless
they
unmistakably
make
clear
that
their
disbelief
in
capital
punishment
would
prevent
them
in
all
cases
from
imposing
it,
not
could
be
excluded
on
either
basis,
that
they
could
not
be
excluded
constitutionally.
that
is
what
witherspoon
held.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
what
witherspoon
said,
it
was
a
negative
decision.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
said
the
state
is
prohibited
from
excusing
from
a
jury
for
cause
of
a
venireman
unless
they
make
clear
the
following.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
witherspoon
didn't
say
what
people
could
be,
but
it
said
what
people
could
not
be.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
as
a
point
of
information,
the
language
quoted
on
pages
19
and
20
of
your
brief,
that
is
from
--
is
that
in
the
appendix?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
we
have
to
look
at
the
original
record
to
get
the
whole
flavor
of
this.
