mr.
douglas
m.
becker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
is
well
aware
of
what
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty
in
general
and
the
constitutionality
specifically
of
the
general
texas
statutes
for
adjudication
of
guilt
and
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
have
previously
been
upheld.
therefore,
the
only
issue
before
us
today
is
fairness
in
the
jury
selection
procedures.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
he
has
correctly
characterized
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
called
a
quirk
of
texas
law,
that
we
would
not
be
able
simply
to
resentence
him
as
far
as
i
know
under
our
procedures.
he
would
be
entitled
to
an
entirely
new
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
under
texas
law
unless
the
governor
were
to
act
in
the
manner
that
he
describes.
he
is
accurate
upon
that
point.
now,
i
want,
to
make
perfectly
clear
what
the
holding
that
the
state
of
texas
is
asking
the
court
to
make
today.
it
is
in
essence
exactly
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
come
out
with
in
the
matter
and
that
is
that
we
have
side
by
side
witherspoon
and
section
1231(b)
of
our
penal
code,
and
that
jurors
who
are
excluded
upon
either
basis
consistently
and
accurately
that
that
would
comply
with
the
constitution.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honor,
section
1231(b)
is
not
aimed
at
all
at
excluding
jurors
solely
because
they
are
against
the
death
penalty.
it
is
neutral
upon
that
basis.
it
is
aimed
as
much
at
excluding
jurors
who
are
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty.
it
is
entirely
neutral
with
respect
to
that
particular
attitude
about
the
death
penalty.
what
is
it
not
neutral
about
is
jurors
who
can
be
biased
in
either
direction.
now,
before
counsel
for
petitioner
made
a
statement
that
if
a
jurors
says
that
he
is
not
unalterably
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,
that
he
should
be
qualified
to
sit,
period,
under
witherspoon.
although
that
may
be
true
and
was
highly
applicable
to
the
pre-furman
type
statutes
that
gave
juries
basically
unbridled
discretion
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
it
shouldn't
be
true
any
more.
such
a
juror
might
well
be
an
extremely
poor
juror
for
the
defendant
or
for
the
state
under
texas
law
because
he
no
longer
has
unbridled
discretion.
the
fact
questions
that
they
had
in
lockett
are
now
in
texas
at
the
punishment
stage
of
trial,
and
really
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
at
all
what
the
jurors'
feelings
are
about
the
death
penalty,
either
pro
or
con,
under
the
texas
statutes
and
texas
law.
and
certainly
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
in
this
case
seem
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
made
very
little
difference.
in
other
words,
the
common
pattern
in
the
voir
dire
was
to
ask
the
juror
what
his
attitudes
were
about
the
death
penalty,
and
if
the
juror
said,
well,
i
am
unalterably
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
and
i
could
never
vote
to
impose
it,
typically
in
almost
every
instance
there
was
no
objection
upon
witherspoon
grounds
or
that
the
juror
was
disqualified
for
service.
in
one
case
where
there
was
an
objection
that
he
was
disqualified,
the
court
said,
well,
tell
him
about
our
statutory
scheme.
the
prosecutor
would
then
go
on
to
explain,
well,
even
though
you
could
never
vote
for
the
death
penalty,
and
i
respect
that
belief,
let
me
explain
the
texas
scheme.
there
are
two
distinctive
features
of
it.
in
the
first
place,
we
have
fact
questions
at
the
guilt
or
innocence
stage
of
trial,
and
you
will
never
actually
have
to
write
life
or
death
on
a
piece
of
paper.
you
will
never
have
to
raise
your
hand
and
vote
that
the
defendant
lives
or
the
defendant
dies.
instead,
you
deliberate
the
questions
of
fact.
now,
even
though
your
feelings
are
very
strong
against
the
death
penalty,
could
you
fairly
deliberate
the
questions
of
fact
knowing
that
you
never
have
to
vote
for
death
or
for
life
actually
directly.
some
jurors
said,
well,
yes,
i
could
do
that,
and
what
the
state
submits
is
that
those
jurors
are
qualified
to
sit
on
a
texas
jury.
under
witherspoon,
the
doctrine
of
witherspoon,
they
might
have
been
excluded
from
jury
service,
and
yet
1231(b)
saves
them
for
jury
service
and
we
don't
think
that
we
need
submit
statistical
studies
to
show
that
many
of
those
jurors
will
be
favorably
disposed
toward
the
defendant.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
that
is
precisely
so,
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
a
round
peg
in
a
square
hole
and
it
will
lead
--
what
it
will
do
is,
if
we
followed
witherspoon
and
not
section
1231(b),
what
we
are
going
to
have
on
texas
juries
and
indeed
those
jurors,
many
of
the
jurors
that
he
complains
about
are
people
who
would
have
been
perfectly
qualified
under
a
pre-furman
unbridled
discretion
type
of
statute.
there
are
people
who
--
he
notes
that
several
of
the
jurors
excluded
were
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty
all
the
way
--
mahon,
jenson,
coyle,
and
probably
mcdonald
who
was
rehabilitated
insofar
as
she
was
ultimately
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honor
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
i
don't
mean
to
be
arguing
something
quite
different.
perhaps
the
confusion
comes
in
with
the
phrase
"does
witherspoon
apply
to
texas."
what
i
have
said
is
at
the
outset
i
think
in
those
death
penalty
trials
in
texas
where
witherspoon
was
used
is
the
basis
for
qualifying
that
test,
that
those
convictions
and
death
penalties
are
all
right
under
the
constitution.
but
i
am
also
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
they
are
under
the
new
statute.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
is
that
either
a
trial
conducted
in
compliance
with
witherspoon
or
in
compliance
with
1231(b)
comports
with
the
constitution.
what
we
are
saying
is
we
agree
with
that
statement,
but
that
1231(b)
is
a
more
fair,
a
more
equitable
and
a
superior
way
to
conduct
voir
dire
jury
examination
in
texas
than
in
witherspoon.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
quite
so,
and
the
idea
is
growing,
your
honor.
in
our
brief,
we
stated
that
the
only
expression
in
texas
law
that
we
knew
of
from
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
for
the
theoretical
construct
is
made
is
judge
odom
dissenting
in
the
hovila
case.
actually
i
probably
overlooked
the
dissenting
opinion
of
another
judge
in
that
case,
and
twelve
days
ago
yet
a
third
judge
dissenting
in
the
death
penalty
case
stated
that
because
i
am
persuaded
that
the
witherspoon
holding
per
se
is
no
longer
a
viable
measure
of
qualifying
jurors
in
the
bifurcated
proceedings
in
a
capital
case.
he
dissents
from
the
majority
opinion.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
it
would
be
difficult.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
no.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
if
a
juror
is
excluded
under
either
one.
now,
personally
i
am
standing
before
the
court
to
say
that
i
think
1231(b)
is
the
fairer
way
to
go
about
it.
it
may
be
--
and
the
difficult
point
about
our
argument
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor,
both.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
the
focal
point
of
the
inquiry
is
quite
different.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
focal
point
of
what
1231(b)
announces
is
quite
different
from
witherspoon
and
necessarily
so
because
of
our
statute.
a
juror
who
was
qualified
under
witherspoon
but
who
was
a
convicted
felon
under
texas
law
is
disqualified
from
service.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
and
for
all
sorts
of
other
reasons.
we
say
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir,
i
know.
but
i
am
saying
that
1231(b)
itself
is
a
point
of
inquiry
that
is
sufficiently
different
from
witherspoon,
that
it
should
stand
as
an
independent
basis
for
exclusion
of
jurors
if
it
is
properly
applied.
now,
one
point
that
we
certainly
admit
is
that
1231(b)
is
a
statute
that
is
susceptible
of
great
abuse.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
if
the
juror
said,
well,
i
don't
like
the
death
penalty
but
if
it
were
really
an
extreme
case
i
could
vote
for
it,
i
suppose,
and
the
prosecutor
says
i
can't
exclude
this
juror
because
of
unalterable
opposition,
i
will
just
come
right
in
and
hit
her
with
the
next
question,
a
statutory
question,
and
she
says,
well,
i
suppose
i
would
be
affected,
then
a
much
more
difficult
case
is
presented.
it
is
possible
that
the
prosecutor,
by
not
explaining
the
meaning
of
the
terms,
has
succeeded
in
subverting
witherspoon
by
using
it
in
this
manner.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
not
spoken
upon
the
meaning
of
the
word
"affect"
now,
i
think
that
this
petitioner's
death
penalty
conviction
will
stand
or
fall
not
upon
what
any
texas
statute
says
nor
upon
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
says,
but
upon
what
was
done
at
his
trial.
that
will
govern
the
outcome.
and
what
was
done
at
his
trial
is
the
way
the
court
and
the
prosecutor
explained
the
1231(b)
question.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
essentially
that
a
juror
would
be
unbiased
on
the
fact
questions
and
deliberations
that
are
at
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
to
be
biased
in
deliberations,
to
be
unfair
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
it
means
that
--
in
its
most
extreme
form,
it
means
that
the
juror
would
lie.
this
question
was
posed
over
and
over
again
and
many
jurors
admitted
that
they
would.
the
question
was
posed
--
especially,
i
would
look
at
the
jurors
who
were
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty
who
were
excluded
upon
the
basis
of
1231(b),
mahon,
jensen
and
coyle,
to
where
they
were
jurors
who
said,
well,
we
like
the
death
penalty
and
then,
when
the
prosecutor
explained
the
sentencing
scheme,
explained
the
questions,
explained
the
aggravated
and
mitigating
factors,
explained
that
their
deliberating
would
be
closely
guided,
the
reaction
that
they
got
from
those
jurors
was
do
you
mean
i
wouldn't
have
in
effect
free
choice,
you
mean
it
wouldn't
be
completely
up
to
me.
and
the
prosecutor
would
say
that's
right.
in
effect,
he
might
have
said
that
is
the
way
it
used
to
be
under
furman,
but
the
supreme
court
said
that
that
tends
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
that
it
is
an
unfair
way
to
qualify
a
jury
or
an
unfair
way
to
inflict
the
death
penalty
upon
someone.
we
don't
do
it
that
way
any
more.
your
discretion
must
be
guided.
and
then
jurors
mahon
and
jensen
in
the
portions
of
voir
dire
cited
in
our
brief
say,
well,
surely
if
i
were
of
the
opinion,
for
whatever
reason,
that
the
defendant
should
live
or
die,
there
would
be
one
of
those
questions
that
would
go
the
way
i
wanted
it
to
go,
and
the
prosecutor
would
say
no,
not
necessarily.
the
questions
may
lead
you
to
a
result
that
is
actually
against
the
way
that
in
the
abstract
you
fell,
apart
from
how
you
feel
that
whatever
penalty
the
defendant
should
receive,
and
then
they
would
reply,
well,
in
that
case
i
don't
believe
i
can
take
the
oath.
they
said
in
effect
i
refuse
of
i
cannot
swear
that
my
deliberations
will
be
guided
in
the
way
the
law
says
they
must
be
guided.
there
were
jurors
who
would
have
been
perfectly
qualified
under
the
pre-furman
statutes
but
they
are
disqualified
under
1231(b)
and
we
submit
that
the
defendant's
jury
is
more
fair
for
that
result.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
if
he
is
qualified
under
witherspoon?
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor,
he
can
be
qualified
under
witherspoon
and
disqualified
under
the
texas
statute.
the
converse
is
also
true.
he
can
be
disqualified
under
witherspoon
and
qualified
under
the
texas
statute.
in
this
case,
precisely
that
thing
happened
to
one
juror.
he
appears
in
the
charts
at
the
conclusion
of
our
brief
and
it
is
a
mistake
in
our
charts.
i
hope
it
is
the
only
one
that
i
made.
he
is
listed
as
a
juror
excluded
on
the
basis
of
witherspoon
or
1231(b),
mr.
smotherman.
actually
that
is
not
true.
he
was
rehabilitated
in
the
manner
that
i
described
and
was
excused
for
a
different
reason.
but
the
testimony,
the
way
the
voir
dire
for
that
juror
was
conducted
to
me
is
a
microcosm
of
all
the
arguments
that
we
have
and
i
would
like
to
take
just
one
minute
to
go
over
it
with
the
court.
he
state
--
he
was
disqualified
under
witherspoon
quite
clearly
at
49-54
of
the
voir
dire.
he
stated
he
could
never
vote
to
impose
the
death
penalty
because
of
his
feelings
against
it.
he
personally
could
not
participate
or,
as
the
question
was
asked,
to
your
way
of
thinking,
you
could
never
ever,
as
you
presently
fell,
could
never
ever
vote
for
the
death
penalty.
answer
that's
right,
i
don't
believe.
the
prosecutor
went
on
to
ask
him
the
statutory
questions,
which
is
the
way
that
all
jurors
are
handled
in
this
voir
dire
and
he
also
agreed
that
he
could
not
--
he
had
to
say
that
"i
believe
i
couldn't
answer
them
all
yes
if
it
would
send
him
to
his
death."
that
is
page
49-59.
at
that
point,
mrs.
james,
the
defense
counsel
took
over
and
she
rehabilitated
him
upon
the
basis
of
section
1231(b).
she
explained
to
him
texas
law
in
more
detail,
explained
to
him
and
asked
him
to
go
over
his
feelings
and
the
next
twenty
pages
are
a
fascinating
study
for
us.
they
show
the
agony
that
the
juror
himself
was
going
through
in
deciding
this
question.
many
of
these
jurors
had
never
thought
about
the
death
penalty
before
they
were
placed
in
the
voir
dire
context,
perhaps
this
man
had
not.
but
as
he
went
through
it
and
as
she
took
him,
at
page
49-69
and
49-70,
it
is
like
a
light
dawning
in
his
mind
when
she
asks
him
--
she
explains
the
procedure
and
says,
"i
do
not,
no
matter
what,
i
don't
believe
in
the
death
penalty
at
all,
that
is
what
i
want
you
to
understand.
question
by
mrs.
james
"you
would
completely
ignore
the
facts
and
automatically
answer
the
questions
no,
regardless
of
the
facts
in
any
case?
"
he
answers,
"i
would
not
do
that."
she
says,
"thank
you.
then
would
there
be
a
feeling
in
your
mind
that
you
would
keep
an
open
mind
and
you
could
take
affirmative
action
in
answering
those
questions
if
you
ever
get
them
which
might
result
or
would
result
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
case?
in
other
words,
could
you
answer
the
questions
as
questions
honestly?"
"yes,
i
think
i
believe
i
could."
and
he
was
rehabilitated
and
the
judge
stated
that
he
was
qualified
to
be
on
the
texas
jury,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
could
have
been
excluded
under
witherspoon
earlier,
and
defense
counsel
rehabilitated
him
using
that
statute.
so
i
think
that
the
statute
is
available
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendant
also.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor,
eventually
he
was
excluded
for
another
reason.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
i
have
problems
with
the
disqualification
of
a
juror.
now,
it
all
depends
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor,
depending
upon
the
interpretation
that
is
given
the
word
"affect,"
and
the
answer
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
with
no
further
explanation
of
the
word
"affect,"
i
have
great
problems
with
that
voir
dire.
i
have
no
problems
with
the
voir
dire
that
was
conducted
in
this
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
redefine
it.
i
want
to
view
it
in
the
manner
it
was
defined
at
this
petitioner's
trial.
and
as
i
say,
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
in
some
opinion,
or
ultimately
it
makes
no
difference
what
you
and
i
might
agree
to.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
the
way
that
such
a
voir
dire
could
--
the
conviction
might
be
upheld
as
to
view
the
word
"affect"
that
everyone
understood
that
it
meant
that
you
could
not
be
unbiased
in
your
deliberations.
if
it
is
interpreted
in
that
manner,
as
perhaps
most
people
would,
then
the
conviction
would
be
safe.
but
if
you
interpret
the
word
"affect"
to
mean
simply
to
scrutinize
the
evidence
more
closely,
then
there
is
a
problem
that
is
involved.
i
think
it
is
up
to
the
trial
courts
and
the
prosecutors
to
explain
to
the
jury
the
meaning
of
the
word
"affect."
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
they
did
it
in
this
case,
your
honor.
they
did
it
at
length
with
every
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
absolutely.
they
explained
it
in
terms
of
--
well.
i
don't
think
i
would
say,
your
honor
--
at
no
point
did
the
prosecutor
or
the
judge
say,
well,
now
i
will
define
the
word
"affect"
as
used
in
the
statute.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
they
did
not,
but
they
explained
the
process
and
it
is
the
process
that
is
important,
not
the
definition
of
the
word,
and
they
said
the
process
is
you
will
get
the
fact
questions,
you
must
answer
them
honestly
based
upon
the
evidence,
not
on
some
whim
you
have,
not
on
some
subjective
conclusion
that
you've
made
during
the
trial,
but
on
the
way
the
law
states
you
must
decide
the
question,
that
that
is
what
you
must
do,
and
if
you
cannot
do
that
that
means
that
you
will
be
affected.
that
is
the
way
it
was
explained.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
all
right,
your
honor.
at
page
20
of
my
brief,
which
i
suppose
is
page
--
well,
i
have
it
marked
as
15-39
to
42
of
the
voir
dire.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know
what
page
of
the
appendix
it
is.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
page
20.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
actually
it
starts
on
19
and
20.
page
19
is
the
explanation
of
the
law
and
the
statute
as
1
just
explained
them
to
mr.
justice
stevens.
then
on
page
20,
the
very
clear
explanation
by
the
court
"you
cannot
go
back
in
the
jury
room
and
say,
well,
i
want
him
to
get
life
imprisonment
so
i
am
going
to
answer
the
questions
no.
you
have
got
to
answer
the
questions
the
way
the
evidence
tells
you
it
ought
to
be
answered
without
any
regard
to
what
punishment
would
result."
and
in
that
context
she
answered
that
she
would
be
affected.
now
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
when
you
read
the
voir
dire
as
a
whole,
you
see
we
are
not
talking
about
some
random
question
just
kind
of
thrown
in
at
some
point
that
hopefully
the
juror
understood
what
they
were
driving
at.
we
are
talking
about
literally
pages
of
explanation
of
the
statute
and
everything
that
i
have
been
talking
about
with
each
venireman,
each
prospective
juror,
and
it
was
unmistakable
in
my
opinion
to
those
jurors
that,
regardless
of
how
mr.
justice
stevens
or
any
justice
would
define
the
word
"affect"
or
as
the
fifth
circuit
did
in
the
burns
case,
that
in
this
case
it
was
defined
in
the
manner
that
i
have
described
to
those
jurors.
they
couldn't
have
missed
it.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
whenever
anything
in
my
brief
is
also
in
the
appendix,
i
followed
it
with
an
appendix
cite,
so
it
is
not.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
most
certainly,
and
there
are
many
parts
of
my
brief
where
the
portions
we
have
cited
are
not
in
the
appendix
and,
yes,
it
will
be
necessary.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
a
number
of
other
original
records
here
in
cases
where
petitions
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
have
been
filed
raising
this
very
question,
this
1231(b)
question.
there
were
five
of
them
filed
in
january
and
those
records
are
here
in
which
the
witherspoon
and
1231(b)
question
was
raised.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
the
court
requested
them.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
they
are
pending.
in
three
of
those
five
cases
where
cert
is
pending,
where
the
records
were
requested
in
january,
the
defendants,
the
petitioners
are
raising
the
questions
not
as
petitioner
here
is
but
that
--
now,
as
i
read
their
petitions
--
but
that
jurors
were
excluded
from
their
trials
because
of
unalterable
opposition
to
the
death
penalty,
and
the
1231(b)
inquiry
was
not
met
and
the
petitioner
is
complaining
because
1231(b)
was
not
invoked,
and
in
my
opinion
they
have
a
stronger
case
than
petitioner
here
today.
but
it
rests
for
another
day,
and
the
case
that
we
have
we
feel
got
him
the
best
jury
that
was
possible.
now,
the
only
basis
--
i
have
explained
that
in
my
opinion
1231(b)
is
going
to
create
the
fairer
jury
for
the
defendant
than
witherspoon
would.
why
then
would
not
petitioners
in
those
three
cases
i
described
now
pending
before
the
court
be
entitled
to
relief?
and
the
only
answer
i
can
give
to
that
is
that
even
though
the
jury
examinations
in
their
cases
were
not
as
good
as
petitioners
adams
had,
the
constitutions
even
in
death
penalty
cases
does
not
require
perfection
and
that
witherspoon
exclusion,
which
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
is
a
sufficiently
fair
method
of
qualification
of
jurors
that
those
convictions
too
would
survive.
one
other
question
that
i
would
attempt
to
give
some
guidance
to
the
court
upon
is
what
affect
upon
the
statutes
of
the
other
states
a
holding
in
our
favor
in
the
manner
we've
advocated
today
would
have.
there
are
38
states
by
my
count
that
now
have
a
death
penalty
statute.
five
of
those
have
judge
sentencing.
so
33
still
have
death
penalty
sentencing
by
jurors.
the
common
pattern,
as
the
court
well
knows,
is
a
set
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors.
as
far
as
i
know,
no
state
has
affirmatively
experienced
the
texas
method
of
not
having
jurors
actually
vote
on
life
or
death
but
merely
answering
the
questions
with
known
automatic
results.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
that's
correct.
now,
the
statute
of
washington
state
appears
to
allow
for
that
but
there
are
no
cases
upon
it
yet.
it
is
a
new
statute.
and
there
are
other
statutes
that
are
ambiguous,
but
i
have
not
read
--
i
do
not
read
their
case
law
as
saying
that
it
--
it
is
certainly
not
as
clear
as
in
texas
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
but
the
statutes
of
all
33
of
those
states
would
be
quite
amenable
to
the
kind
of
1231(b)
qualification
and
rejection
of
a
witherspoon
type
qualification
if
they
so
desired.
it
might
have
that
effect.
as
i
say,
if
we
have
made
the
jump
from
furman
to
jurek,
from
the
unbridles
discretion
statute
to
the
guided
discretion
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interest
of
justice
and
the
interest
of
the
defendant
will
best
be
served
by
having
jurors
who
can
swear
that
they
are
going
to
be
fair
on
the
questions
of
fact,
that
they
will
be
fair
in
deliberating
on
the
questions
of
fact,
regardless
of
their
feelings
on
the
death
penalty,
and
that
that
will
lead
to
a
jury
more
expressive
of
the
community
conscience
than
the
jury
the
petitioner
contends
he
ought
to
have
had
at
his
trial.thank
you.
