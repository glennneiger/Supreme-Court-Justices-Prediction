justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
next
question
said
though,
what
do
you
mean
by
affect.
well,
i
am
very
likely
to
be
very
sympathetic
and
in
the
case
of
a
tie,
if
i
am
really
in
doubt,
i
am
going
to
vote
in
favor
of
the
defendant
just
because
i
am
against
the
death
penalty,
would
that
add
anything
to
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
could
the
juror
then
be
excluded?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
if
the
juror
said
--
if
the
juror
had
earlier
said
well,
i
think
i
can
answer
the
question
as
truthfully
and
faithfully
without
regard
to
my
feelings
about
the
death
penalty,
but
ultimately
had
said
what
i
just
suggested
he
said,
then
his
answers
would
be
just
inconsistent,
wouldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
yet
you
think
it
is
not
inconsistent
between
his
earlier
answers
that
he
could
answer
these
questions
fairly
and
his
later
answer
that,
well,
my
opposition
to
the
death
penalty
will
affect
my
verdict.
you
don't
think
that
is
inconsistent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
about
curtis
williams,
page
32.
the
court
"would
you
be
influenced
by
the
death
penalty
part
to
keep
you
from
voting
yes?"
the
witness
"i
think
i
would
be
influenced
by
the
death
penalty."
it
sounds
to
me
like
he
is
saying
yes,
i
would
be
influenced
in
a
way
that
would
keep
me
from
voting
yes.
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
becker,
let
me
interrupt
you.
i
had
understood
from
your
brief
--
perhaps
i
didn't
read
it
correctly
--
that
you
were
conceding
that
witherspoon
does
apply
in
texas
in
light
of
the
new
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
brief
says
that
categorically.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
it
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
something
quite
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
page
33
of
your
brief
you
state
that
the
texas
criminal
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
witherspoon
is
applicable
to
capital
cases
in
texas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
decisions
decided
since
the
statute
became
effect
on
january
1,
1974
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
was
enacted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
under
the
new
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
you
can
argue
that
under
texas
law
witherspoon
does
not
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
see
how
that
worked
out
with
some
of
these
jurors,
but
give
me
the
language
on
juror
white,
where
she
conceded
something
about
what
she
could
or
couldn't
do
that
would
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
page
of
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
all
those
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
denied
cert
or
are
they
held?
