justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
ford
motor
credit
company
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
it
presents
is
whether
the
petitioner,
finance
company,
violated
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
the
implementing
federal
reserve
board
regulation
z
by
failing
to
disclose
on
the
front
page
of
its
standard
retail
installment
contracts
that
the
petitioner
retained
the
right
to
accelerate
payment
of
the
full
amount
of
the
debt
upon
the
buyers
to
fall
in
the
payment
of
any
installment.
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
oregon
held
that
facial
disclosure
of
this
acceleration
clause
was
mandated
by
the
truth
in
lending
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
but
on
another
ground.
we
reversed.
we
hold
for
reason
stated
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
that
the
truth
and
lending
act
does
not
mandate
a
general
rule
of
disclosure
for
these
acceleration
clauses.
mr.
justice
blackmun
joined
by
the
chief
justice
while
joining
the
court
opinion
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
