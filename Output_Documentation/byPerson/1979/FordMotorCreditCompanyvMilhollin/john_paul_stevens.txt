justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
you
just
said
something
about
it
being
easily
understood.
i
read
you
paragraph
14,
which
is
the
one
you
are
centering
on.
"borrower
may
pre-pay
his
obligations
under
this
contract
in
full
at
any
time
prior
to
maturity
of
the
final
instalment
hereunder.
and
if
he
does
so,
shall
receive
a
rebate
of
the
unearned
portion
of
the
finance
charge
computed
under
the
sum
of
the
digits
method,
after
first
deducting
an
acquisition
fee
of
$15."
do
you
think
that
is
readily
understood
by
the
average
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
ordinary
buyer
would
know
what
the
word
"acceleration"
means,
except
in
connection
with
a
car,
you
put
your
foot
on
the
foot
feed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
might
be
a
person
might
eventually
learn
what
"acceleration"
is
on
a
note;
but
it
isn't
an
article
of
nature,
is
it?
