mr.
richard
a.
slottee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
is
please
the
court.
i
respondent
the
respondents
in
this
case,
dennis
and
michelle
milhollin
and
miss
donna
eaton
who
were
the
consumers
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
the
milhollin's
spell
it
with
two
l's
and
we
have
spelled
it
with
one
l
throughout
the
litigation,
from
the
district
court,
to
the
ninth
circuit,
up
to
and
including
all
the
briefs.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
they
haven't
discharged
me
yet.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
it
is
m-i-l.
it
is
milhollin.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
that
is
correct.
--
and
nine
donna
barren
--
these
were
two
separate
transactions
--
who
purchased,
their
automobiles
from
ford
near
credit
company.
i
would
like
to
add
just
one
additional
fact
that
was
not
brought
out
by
the
petitioner
and
that
is
the
milhollin's
were
payments
late
on
their
contract,
when
without
prior
notice
ford
motor
credit
repossessed
their
automobile.
on
the
sane
day
as
the
repossession,
the
milhollin's
offered
to
pay
ford
motor
the
exact
amount
of
the
delinquent
payments.
in
fact
ford
motor
denied
this
and
indicated
that
they
accelerated
the
unpaid
balance
and
they
demanded
the
entire
unpaid
balance
of
the
contract.
there
are
three
points
which
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court
this
afternoon.
first,
all
the
parties
concerned,
the
federal
reserve
board
staff,
the
solicitor
general,
the
consumers
and
ford
motor
credit
agree
that
in
a
contract
like
the
one
signed
by
the
consumers
in
this
case,
the
effect
on
the
finance
charge
of
the
process
of
acceleration
is
important
information
to
be
disclosed
to
the
consumers
under
the
provisions
of
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
regulation
z.
second,
the
consumers
could
prevail
in
this
case
under
either
the
views
expressed
by
the
federal
reserve
board
staff
or
the
rationale
of
the
court
below.
we
think
that
the
lower
court's
opinion
is
the
better
rule
since,
unlike
the
views
of
the
federal
reserve
board
staff,
it
consistently
guarantees
the
disclosure
of
meaningful
information
to
the
consumer
in
all
credit
transactions.
and
third,
the
federal
reserve
board
itself
has
not
made
known
its
position
on
this
matter.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
certainly
agree
with
your
honor
and,
in
fact,
it
has
been
raised
by
some
people
that
what
in
fact
the
truth
in
lending
act
is
doing
is
making
disclosure
statements
more
confusing
rather
than
simpler.
and
i
have
several
answers
to
that
remark.
the
first
is
--
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
joint
appendix
pages
9
and
10
--
the
majority
of
the
provisions
on
a
contract
are
not
those
required
by
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
regulation
z.
rather,
there
are
terms
that
are
inserted
by
the
creditors
themselves,
and
is
those
extra
terms
that
are
the
terms
that
are
causing
the
contracts
to
become
longer
and
more
confusing.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
no,
your
honor.
the
disclosures
that
are
on
the
face
of
the
contract
or
on
a
separate
document
--
they
don't
necessarily
have
to
be
on
the
contract
--
are
fairly
limited
in
their
scope.
in
this
case
the
petitioners
could
have
remedied
the
violation
by
simply
adding
two
words
to
their
disclosure
which
would
have
given
the
meaningful
information
to
the
consumer
that
they
needed
prior
to
entering
the
contract
to
be
able
to
judge
the
effect
on
the
credit
and
the
cost
of
credit,
should
default
to
the
contract
be
accelerated.
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
several
times
in
his
brief
that
the
federal
reserve
board
has
in
fact
issued
an
official
interpretation
on
this.
and
to
this
extent
the
solicitor
general
is
mistaken.
the
only
interpretation
that
has
been
issued
is
an
official
staff
interpretation
and
there
have
been
three
unofficial
staff
opinions
that
have
been
issued.
but
there
has
been
no
award
interpretation.
and
this
is
in
fact
the
reason
that
the
confusion
among
the
circuits
and
the
various
disarray
in
the
circuits
has
been
created,
is
the
federal
reserve
board,
granted
as
the
agency
authorized
by
congress
to
implement
the
truth
in
lending
act,
has
failed
to
issue
an
interpretation
which
will
solve
the
confusion
which
will
answer
the
questions
which
will
tell
consumers
and
creditors
alike
what
disclosures
have
to
be
made.
in
that
situation,
it
is
natural
that
the
courts
have
stepped
in,
taken
over
for
the
federal
reserve
board
itself,
and
tried
to
remedy
the
situation;
and
they
have
come
up
with
six
or
seven
different
theories.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
there
has
been
one
osi
official
staff
interpretation
that
was
issued.
and
that
was
fc-54.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
we
have
had
basically
three
different
positions.
you
have
got
the
ninth
circuit
position,
which
didn't
follow
it.
you
had
several
other
circuits
which
followed
it
completely
and
several
others
which
said
disclosures
never
have
to
be
made
about
acceleration.
i
will
explain
the
problem
to
you
with
the
osi.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
federal
reserve
board
official
interpretations
basically
agree
that
the
process
of
acceleration
can
affect
the
cost
of
credit
and
that
an
early
termination
of
the
contract
will
affect
the
amount
of
the
finance
charge
that
is
going
to
be
rebated
and
that
is
information
to
be
disclosed
to
the
consumer.
that
is
the
basis
of
the
official
staff
interpretation
and
that
is
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
where
the
two
part
company
is
on
the
situations
when
that
disclosure
has
to
be
made
to
the
consumer.
the
federal
reserve
board
staff
is
concerned
with
the
affect
on
the
consumer
of
acceleration,
whereas
the
ninth
circuit
is
concerned
with
the
information
that
will
be
given
to
the
consumer
about
acceleration
and
its
affect
on
the
finance
charge.
and
i
think
a
good
example
is
represented
by
54.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
truth
in
lending
act
--
and
it
was
indicated
by
the
petitioner
--
is
to
promote
comparative
credit
shopping
by
consumers.
now,
if
you
take
official
staff
interpretation
54
and
apply
it
to
a
common
situation
with
two
creditors.
the
consumer
is
going
out
and
trying
to
shop
for
credit,
to
decide
which
is
going
to
be
the
best
credit
deal
for
that
consumer.
if
these
two
creditors
rebate
upon
acceleration
by
exactly
the
same
method,
but
they
differ
as
to
pre-payment
since
that
one
creditor
rebates
by
the
same
method
in
both
situations
and
the
other
creditor
differs,
the
first
creditor
will
only
have
to
disclose
the
pre-payment
method.
the
second
creditor
will
have
to
disclose
both
the
pre-payment
method
and
the
method
for
acceleration.
the
consumer
will
look
at
those
contracts
and,
despite
the
fact
that
both
creditors
rebate
upon
acceleration
by
the
same
method,
will
see
only
one
rebate
disclosure
for
acceleration.
the
consumer
would
reasonably
believe
that
the
first
creditor
has
a
better
deal
for
him,
or
her,
because
there
is
no
indication
about
any
finance
charge
rebate
or
lack
thereof
on
acceleration,
and
there
is
no
way
the
consumer
could
reasonably
meaningfully
comparative
shop
in
that
situation.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
on
the
reverse
of
the
contract,
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
regulation
z
says,
that
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
have
meaningful
disclosure,
the
disclosure
has
to
be
on
the
face
of
the
contract.
and
there
is
a
very
practical
reason
for
that.
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
it
is
very
easy
to
have,
for
instance,
a
separate
disclosure
statement
separate
from
the
contract.
in
that
case
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
you
can
have
a
larger
and
longer
front
page.
or
in
this
situation
--
this
is
ford
motor's
contract
--
simply
an
additional
two
words
would
have
provided
that
consumer
with
the
information
on
that
they
needed.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
would
put
the
two
words,
your
honor
--
in
paragraph
14,
it
says
buyer
may
pre-pay
his
obligations,
etc.,
upon
pre-payment
or
acceleration
buyer
will
receive
a
rebate
of
the
unearned
portion
of
the
finance
charge.
"or
acceleration"
would
be
the
adequate
disclosure.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
think
in
fact
they
will,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
reading
the
fine
print
on
a
contract
is
exactly
the
problem.
most
purchasers
do
not
read
the
fine
print
on
a
contract,
which
was
the
entire
rationale
for
the
truth
in
lending
act,
put
it
on
the
front.
as
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
well
this
is
slightly
reduced
down
for
the
purpose
of
the
appendix.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
compared
to
the
back
of
the
contract
it
is
very
large.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
don't
think
the
size
of
the
print
is
the
issue.
the
issue
is
to
put
the
required
disclosures,
that
credit
information
which
is
important
for
the
consumer
in
one
location
at
a
certain
time
before
the
contract
is
entered
so
that
it
can
be
easily
road
and
understood.
you
obviously
can't
legislate
why
he
is
credit
shopping
but
what
you
can
legislate
is
the
information
to
give
the
consumer
the
ability
to
make
the
wise
credit
shopping.
now,
when
you
bury
an
acceleration
clause
and
its
effect
on
the
finance
charge
on
the
reverse
of
the
contract,
you
are
taking
away
that
ability
for
the
majority
of
the
consumers.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
think
it
is
understood
except
for
"the
sum
of
the
digits
method,"
which
if
you
read
in
most
state
statutes
is
really
confusing.
in
fact
that
issue
has
been
litigated
in
several
circuits
and
the
rationale
behind
upholding
that
disclosure
is
that
the
alternative
to
saying
rule
of
78,
the
sum
of
the
digit
method,
is
a
disclosure
which
is
just
as
complicated
and
much,
much
more
lengthy.
putting
out
the
mathematical
formula
or
explanation
of
the
rule
of
78
is
not
going
to
provide
meaningful
information
to
anybody,
lawyers,
judges,
mathematicians,
accountants.
the
alternative
in
this
case
is
simply
a
two
or
three
word
disclosure
on
a
contract,
but
certainly
no
[illegible
word]
h
adverse
consequences.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
agree
but
putting
"acceleration"
or
some
term
other
than
acceleration,
it
explains
the
consequences
of
default.
it
certainly
has
to
be
better,
it
has
to
give
more
information
to
the
consumer
than
simply
having
pre-pay
and
assuming
that
the
consumer
is
going
to
understand
that
the
term
"pre-pay"
also
encompasses
the
concept
of
acceleration
after
default.
more
consumers
are
going
to
think
that
"pre-pay"
means
a
voluntary
payment
prior
to
the
maturity
of
the
contract
as,
indeed,
the
contract
indicates
pre-payment
has
to
be
made
before
maturity
of
the
final
instalment.
and
you
have
acceleration
or
payment
after
acceleration
or
payment
of
the
entire
unpaid
balance
in
conjunction
with
an
explanation
to
rebate,
that
is
information
that
a
consumer
is
going
to
have
a
better
chance
of
understanding.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
well,
in
fact
you
may
have
to
change
the
words
around
in
the
paragraph.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
well,
in
a
number
of
contracts
it
would
be
a
matter
of
simply
adding
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
could
change
the
words
around
in
the
paragraph
very
slightly
to
make
it
--
put
"or
acceleration"
or
"payment
after
acceleration."
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
exactly,
your
honor.
the
second
problem
with
staff
interpretation
54
is
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
what
to
do
when
the
contract
has
a
pre-payment
disclosure
on
the
front
and
an
acceleration
clause
on
the
back
that
says
that
the
creditor
has
the
right
to
accelerate
the
unpaid
balance
but
does
not
disclose
the
method
by
which
that
rebate
for
the
finance
charge
will
remain.
and
what
the
staff
has
said
in
this
situation
is
you
look
to
undisclosed
non-binding
creditor
policy
to
determine
what
in
fact
the
creditor
will
do.
you
basically
say
what
is
the
policy
of
the
creditor;
if
the
policy
of
the
creditor,
regardless
of
the
contract
term,
is
to
rebate
the
same
as
for
pre-payment,
then
no
disclosure
has
to
be
made.
if
the
policy
of
the
creditor
is
to
rebate
for
other
than
pre-payment,
then
they
have
to
make
a
separate
disclosure.
and
there
are
numerous
problems
of
this.
the
first
is
-
how
is
the
consumer,
the
person
whom
the
act
is
intended
to
protect,
going
to
be
able
to
determine
what
the
undisclosed
policy
of
the
creditor
is.
second,
that
policy
is
not
binding.
it
is
a
non-written,
undisclosed
policy,
it
is
not
binding
on
the
creditor
and
it
is
not
binding
on
the
creditor's
assignee.
and
that
in
fact
frustrates
the
enforcement
mechanism
of
the
act.
it
was
indicated
by
the
solicitor
general
private
consumers
are
in
fact
a
primary
enforcement
mechanism
of
the
act.
since
acceleration
or
rebate
of
the
finance
charge
is
not
going
to
occur
until
there
is
a
default,
and
that
is
when
the
policy
of
the
creditor
will
in
fact
become
known,
that
default
may
incur
after
a
year;
and
the
act
has
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations.
and
if
it
occurs
after
the
year,
the
consumer
is
simply
not
going
to
have
any
remedy.
the
creditor,
who
has
a
non-binding
policy,
in
fact
is
going
to
be
able
to
change
that
policy
however
they
want.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
ford
motor
changed
their
policy
twice,
in
the
milhollin
case
and
in
the
eaton
case.
but
the
contract
disclosures
state
exactly
the
same.
in
the
first
case,
the
affidavit
indicated
that
upon
the
act
of
acceleration
they
rebated
according
to
pre-payment.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor,
unless
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
the
contract
which
will
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
--
a
certain
addition,
and
i
think
it
is
1973.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
how
many
contracts
are
outstanding,
i
assume
that
they
number
in
probably
the
millions.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
in
the
early
1970's
acceleration
clauses
were
normally
on
the
back
of
the
contract
rather
than
on
the
front,
and
that
is
in
fact
what
fostered
most
of
the
litigation
that
has
worked
its
way
up
to
the
circuits.
it
is
not
in
the
record
now,
but
we
deal
with
a
lot
of
these
contracts
and
i
think
the
normal
rule
now
is
to
have
the
acceleration
clause
on
the
front
of
the
contract
rather
than
on
the
back.
creditors
simply
have
not
found
that
too
much
of
a
burden
to
change.
and
you
raise
an
interesting
point,
because
one
of
the
suggestions
that
has
been
made
is
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
ruling
in
the
ninth
circuit
or
requires
the
disclosure
of
acceleration
and
its
affect
on
the
finance
charge,
it
is
instantly
going
to
throw
millions
and
millions
of
consumer
contracts
in
default
and
it
is
going
to
cost
the
credit
industry
untold
millions
of
dollars.
and
it
is
simply
not
the
case.
there
are
two
protection
for
the
creditors
in
the
act.
one
protection
is
a
one-year,
very
short
statute
of
limitations.
you
file
your
suit
within
one
year
from
the
date
the
contract
is
signed
or
you
are
out
of
luck.
for
all
those
creditors
that
have
violated
milhollin
or
st.
germaine,
the
year
has
run
and
they
have
no
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
there
are
still
millions
within
the
year
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
but
there
is
a
second
protection
to
cover
those
millions.
and
that
is
the
act
provides
an
absolute
protection
to
the
creditor
who
in
good
faith
relies
on
any
official
staff
interpretation
issued
by
the
federal
reserve
board,
despite
the
fact
that
that
official
staff
interpretation
is
later
revoked
or
rescinded
by
a
court.
so
if
this
court
affirms
the
ninth
circuit,
rejects
the
rationale
of
the
official
staff
interpretation,
those
creditors
who
in
good
faith
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
there
are
several
courts
of
appeals
who
have
interpreted
the
official
staff
interpretation
different
than
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
the
rule
would
state
the
same.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
well,
they
haven't
struck
down
the
section
of
the
act.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
because
the
statute
specifically
says
that
a
creditor
who
in
good
faith
relies
on
an
official
staff
interpretation
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
for
those
creditors
who
relied
on
the
staff
interpretation
after
the
circuit
court
opinion
came
down,
i
think
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
am
sorry.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
the
official
staff
interpretation
in
this
case
was
in
1977.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
now,
any
person
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
any
creditor
who
relied
on
that
staff
interpretation
would
be
protected
regardless
of
a
subsequent
circuit
court
opinion.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
and
before
the
official
staff
interpretation.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
it
don't.
they
get
their
disclosures
from
the
face
of
the
contract.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
the
milhollin
contract
was
signed
before
the
act
was
amended
to
allow
for
that
type
of
credit
to
be
made.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
so
there
is
no
interpretation
to
rely
upon,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
as
a
creditor
--
i
had
a
client
who
was
a
creditor?
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
if
i
could
put
myself
in
that
situation
--
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
probably.
--
i
would
show
that
in
fact
i
had
a
department
of
my
company
that
reviewed
truth
in
lending
official
staff
interpretations
and
compared
them
with
the
contracts.
and
in
a
suit
i
would
simply
put
on
an
affidavit
or
the
testimony
that
says
i
in
fact
read
this
and
i
relied
upon
that
when
i
drafted
my
contract.
whether
that
is
going
to
be
sufficient
or
not,
i
am
not
sure.
but
i
think
that
is
what
congress
intended
when
they
in
fact
passed
the
act.
the
ninth
circuit
has
avoided
these
two
particular
problems,
the
one
of
undisclosed
creditor
policy
for
reliance
and
the
one
for
comparative
credit
shopping
by
having
a
rule
that
consistently
guarantees
meaningful
information
to
the
consumer.
and
that
is
basically
you
always
have
to
disclose
the
effect
of
the
finance
charge,
the
effect
of
acceleration
on
the
finance
charge
rebate;
whether
or
not
it
is
the
same
for
acceleration
and/or
pre-payment.
that
is
the
one
way
which
the
consumer
will
always
be
able
to
get
the
information
they
need.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
i
think
that
is
the
heart
of
the
matter,
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
the
same
interest
in
this
case
as
ford
motor
does,
and
that
is
the
federal
reserve
board
has
not
made
known
their
position
on
this
matter.
and
we
want
to
get
a
uniform
decision,
something
that
everybody
can
rely
upon.
we
think
that
the
decision
should
be
that
in
accordance
with
the
federal
reserve
board's
staff
interpretation
the
effect
of
acceleration
on
the
finance
charge
rebate
is
credit
information
that
has
to
be
disclosed
to
the
consumer,
and
second,
the
rationale
or
the
disclosure
method
that
should
be
used
is
not
that
as
the
federal
reserve
board
staff
indicates,
but
that
which
the
ninth
circuit
indicates.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
the
deference
that
is
to
be
accorded
to
a
federal
reserve
--
to
an
agency
interpretation,
or
the
opinions
of
an
agency,
it
would
depend
on
a
number
of
factors,
the
evidence
in
consideration,
the
validity
of
its
reasoning,
its
consistency
with
prior
and
future
pronouncements.
mr.
richard
a.
slottee
it
wasn't
in
the
mourning
opinion,
it
was
in
another
case,
the
skidmore
case.
the
mourning
opinion
had
to
do
with
the
authority
of
the
federal
reserve
board
to
issue
a
regulation
and
whether
they
had
that
authority
under
the
act.
and
that
is
not
the
case
here,
we
are
talking
about
something
different.
we
are
not
attacking
the
authority
of
the
federal
reserve
board
to
issue
226.8(b)(7)
or
226.8(a).
we
think
that
8(b)(7)
is
perfectly
proper.
what
we
are
questioning
is
the
details
of
the
application
of
the
staff's
interpretation
of
that
particular
regulation.
i
would
just
like
to
say
one
other
thing
in
closing,
and
that
is
it
has
been
indicated
that
there
have
been
a
lot
of
truth
in
lending
suits
filed
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
number
is
significantly
increasing.
and
the
implication,
though
it
hasn't
been
said
directly,
is
that
a
number
of
these
suits
are
frivolous.
i
have
several
comments
to
that.
first,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
there
is
no
citation
in
any
cases
that
i
know
of
that
says
anything
that
these
increased
truth
in
lending
suits
are
in
fact
frivolous.
in
fact,
i
think
what
they
may
represent
is
the
increase
in
consumer
credit
in
the
united
states
and
the
lack
of
creditor
compliance
with
the
terms
of
truth
in
lending.
and
i
would
also
mention
something
that
this
court
stated
just
several
months
ago
in
ryder
v.
sonotone
which
authorized
private
class
actions
under
the
antitrust
act.
that
same
concern
was
raised
by
sonotone
in
that
case
and
the
court
said
basically
that
is
not
an
unimportant
consideration
but
district
courts
should
be
aware
and
vigilant
for
frivolous
suits,
but
it
is
up
to
congress
to
provide
adequate
funds
for
judges
to
handle
the
truth
in
lending
suits
or
to
handle
the
suits
that
may
arise
under
the
anti-trust
act.
i
think
the
heart
of
the
situation
is
not
the
deference
to
be
accorded
to
the
staff
opinions
but
whether
or
not
in
the
application
of
these
opinions
the
consumer
is
going
to
receive
the
meaningful
information
that
they
are
entitled
to
under
the
terms
of
the
act
and
under
the
statements
of
this
court
in
mourning.
thank
you.
