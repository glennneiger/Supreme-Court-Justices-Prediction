justice

f.
powell,

do
you
really
think
the
automobile
purchasers
would
be
motivated
to
go
ahead
and
compare
contracts
on
the
basis
of
these
two
words
being
added?
do
you
really
think
so?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
you
ever
known
a
purchaser
of
an
automobile
to
read
all
the
fine
print
in
one
of
these
contracts?
maybe
a
fleet
purchaser,
but
i
don't
know
about
a
little,
ordinary
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
record
show
how
long
the
ford
motor
company
has
been
using
this
form?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
any
idea
of
how
many
contracts
are
out-standing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
a
contract
that
is
fairly
general
in
the
industry
or
is
this
unique
to
ford
motor?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
does
the
average
purchase
of
an
automobile
even
go
back
to
a
staff
interpretation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
does
your
point
have
any
significance
that
this
is
an
out
for
the
companies
who
have
these
contracts
outstanding?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
right,
forget
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
try
again.
suppose
you
had
a
client
and
you
want
to
prove
reliance,
what
would
you
have
to
show;
that
he
had
read
the
federal
register?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
would
be
difficult,
would
it.
