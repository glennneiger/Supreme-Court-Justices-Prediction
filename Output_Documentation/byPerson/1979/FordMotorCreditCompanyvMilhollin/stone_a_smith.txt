mr.
stone
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
repeat
what
mr.
burke
has
said.
i
think
that
he
[illegible
words]
case
on
the
statute
under
regulation
3
for
the
correctness
of
the
board's
official
staff
interpretation
fc-0054
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
52
through
56
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
if,
as
we
submit,
the
board
concludes
that
this
official
staff
interpretation
of
the
board
has
correctly
construed
the
act
and
regulation
z
with
respect
to
the
disclosure
of
acceleration
clauses
and
the
rebate
policy
on
payment
of
unearned
finance
charges
upon
payment
after
acceleration,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
judgment
below
has
to
be
reversed.
what
i
would
like
to
describe
briefly
for
the
court,
it
is
set
forth
in
greater
detail
in
petitioners'
reply
brief
in
the
appendix
to
his
reply
brief,
is
the
process
pursuant
to
which
official
staff
interpretations
are
issued.
the
court
in
the
mourning
case
has
indicated
that
where
reasonable
minds
may
differ
as
to
which
of
several
remedial
methods
should
be
chosen,
the
court
should
defer
to
the
informed
judgement
of
the
agency.
and
here
the
agency
that
congress
has
vested
authority
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
is
the
federal
reserve
board.
the
part
of
the
federal
reserve
board
that
deals
with
the
truth
in
lending
act
is
the
office
of
consumer
affairs
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
and
these
official
staff
interpretations
are
the
product
of
a
specialized
group
of
people
within
the
staff
of
the
board
which
are
expert
in
the
area
of
consumer
credit.
we
think
that
is
why
they
ought
to
be
entitled
to
great
deference.
to
begin
with,
let
me
say
at
the
outset
before
i
begin
to
describe
the
process,
that
congress
itself
has
recognized
that
official
staff
interpretations
of
the
board
are
such
that
they
ought
to
be
given
deference.
in
1974
congress
amended
the
truth
in
lending
act
to
provide
for
civil
and
criminal
immunity
if
a
person
acts
in
good
faith,
relies
upon
the
board's
interpretation.
but
two
years
later
congress
determined
that
good
faith
reliance
on
the
board's
interpretation
was
insufficient
and
they
extended
the
immunity
to
good
faith
conformity
with
any
interpretation
or
approval
by
a
duly
authorized
official
or
employee
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
in
our
view,
this
1976
amendment
demonstrates
a
congressional
vote
of
confidence
in
the
quality
and
reliability
these
official
staff
interpretations.
and
the
process
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
we
think
confirms
the
correctness
of
this
congressional
vote
of
confidence.
official
staff
interpretation
are
issued
in
response
to
inquires
by
private
parties,
either
debtors
or
creditors,
to
the
federal
reserve
board.
and
when
the
inquiry
comes
in
the
matter
is
assigned
to
a
staff
attorney
to
prepare
a
draft.
and
the
reason
i
am
going
into
this
in
great
detail
is
because
the
other
side
has
characterized
these
official
staff
interpretations
as
the
work
of
a
lone
attorney
or
a
lone
board
employee.
and
really
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth,
because
the
draft
is
prepared
by
a
lone
person
but
then
the
process
involves
a
very
deep
and
detailed
consultation
with
other
staff
attorneys,
section
chiefs
and
officials
of
the
consumer
affairs
office
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
after
the
matter
is
then
discussed
with
various
officials
who
have
demonstrated
familiarity
with
the
particular
problem
and
the
official
staff
interpretation
is
only
issued
after
further
review
by
a
section
chief
and
approval
by
two
officials
of
the
consumer
affairs
office
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
now,
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter,
because
then
the
official
staff
interpretation
is
sent
to
the
federal
register
for
publication.
and
in
1977,
when
this
official
staff
interpretation
--
the
one
at
issue
here
--
was
promulgated,
the
board
then
had
a
practice
of
issuing
some
osi's
with
immediately
effective
dates
and
some
with
delayed
effective
dates.
but
the
implication
was
the
same
and
that
is
the
public
was
entitled
to
make
comments.
by
"the
public,"
i
mean
not
only
the
community
of
consumers
but
the
banking
community
and
the
people
who
lend
in
the
consumer
credit
area.
this
particular
osi
was
issued
with
an
immediate
effective
date
but
there
was
a
provision,
as
i
said,
for
reconsideration
upon
request.
there
was
no
request
for
reconsideration
of
this
osi.
now,
all
osi's
were
then
and
now
reviewed
quarterly
by
a
consumer
affairs
committee
which
is
a
committee
of
members
of
the
federal
reserve
board
itself
who
have
been
assigned
oversight
responsibility
over
the
work
of
the
office
of
consumer
affairs
--
i
think
it
is
called
community
consumer
affairs
now
--
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
now,
as
of
april
19,
1978
the
board
amended
its
procedure
to
provide
for
a
delayed
effective
date
of
30
days
with
respect
to
all
official
staff
interpretations
and
a
period
of
public
comment.
and
the
period
of
public
comment
useful
to
provide
the
board
with
input
from
people
who
are
affected
by
these
technical
interpretations.
between
august
1976
and
april
1978,
147
oso's
were
issued
under
regulation
z.
six
were
reconsidered
pursuant
to
request
and
none
were
changed.
under
the
new
procedure
where
everything
gets
a
delayed
effective
date,
20
official
staff
interpretations
have
been
issued,
nine
have
been
considered,
and
again,
none
have
been
changed.
the
point
that
we
think
is
important
here
for
the
court
is
that
this
entire
process
is
marked
by
very
careful
consideration
and
it
is
the
product
of
the
special
expertise
of
a
group
of
highly
trained
people
who
have
demonstrated
deep
familiarity
with
the
consumer
credit
field.
and
it
is
important
that
these
official
staff
interpretations
receive
deference,
because
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
properly
pointed
out,
these
technical
questions
require
authoritative
answers
by
a
central
authority.
and
indeed
the
disarray
in
this
case
is
indicative
of
the
problems
that
arise.
we
now
have
five
or
six
different
circuits
who
have
expressed
themselves
on
the
question
of
pre-payment
under
the
finance
disclosure
charge
policy
and
each
have
indicated
slightly
different
ways
that
they
would
go
about
providing
for
this
disclosure.
mr.
stone
a.
smith
well,
the
board
has
spoken
in
osi
fc-0054
which
it
believes
is
the
--
mr.
stone
a.
smith
nothing
by
formal
rule-making
although,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
would
think
that
once
the
litigation
commenced
on
this
issue
the
board
might
have
--
it
might
have
been
inappropriate
for
the
board
then
--
mr.
stone
a.
smith
well,
yes.
but
i
think
that
if
this
court
holds
as
we
submit
it
should
that
official
staff
interpretations
are
entitled
to
deference,
i
think
a
lot
of
kind
of
litigation
over
very
small
questions
under
the
act,
small
disclosure
questions
will
cease
because
i
think
the
statistics
in
the
briefs
have
indicated
that
the
volume
of
truth
in
lending
litigations
has
mushroomed
enormously
as
people
have
challenged
the
propriety
of
a
variety
questions
of
disclosure
under
the
act.
mr.
stone
a.
smith
yes,
although
--
no,
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
not.
my
understanding
is
they
generally
have
followed
them
and
this
case
i
think
is
an
unusual
instance
where
there
has
been
a
wide
variety
of
judicial
rule-making
in
this
area.
but
i
think,
as
our
brief
points
out,
generally
they
have
been
give
the
deference
that
we
think
they
deserve.
and
what
i
want
to
say
in
closing
is
simply
that
this
judicial
disarray
has
in
our
view
hampered
enforcement
by
the
various
agencies
that
are
given
the
enforcement
powers
under
the
act.
because
while
private
debtors
or
consumers
can
bring
actions
under
the
act,
a
variety
of
agencies
such
as
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
--
they
are
all
set
forth
in
15
u.s.c.
1507
--
have
been
given
responsibility
by
congress
according
to
the
kind
of
creditor
to
enforce
the
act.
now,
these
agencies
necessarily
have
to
look
to
and
rely
upon
the
official
staff
interpretations
of
the
board.
and
if
they
can't
do
that,
then
i
think
that
the
uniformity
congress
sought
to
impose
in
this
area
will
be
severely
hampered.
