rehnquist
mr.
slottee,
i
don't
mean
to
get
anecdotal
about
this
but
supposing
you
have
the
most
consumer-oriented
court
or
board
in
the
world
and
it
is
trying
to
figure
out
what
has
to
be
disclosed
and
what
hasn't.
i
can
remember
a
committee
i
served
on
drafting
a
truth
in
land
sales
act
and
we
were
following
a
model
of
a
state
which
had
a
three-page
list
of
requirements
that
had
to
be
disclosed.
one
of
them,
a
particular
disclosure
was
that
during
periods
of
high
water
all
or
parts
of
this
lot
may
be
under
water.
it
didn't
prevent
the
lot
from
selling
at
all.
whereas,
had
it
been
limited
to
just
a
few
very
important
things
it
might
have
prevented
the
lot
from
selling.
i
would
think
that
from
a
consumer's
point
of
view
you
would
want
a
limited,
but
important,
category
of
information
disclosed;
and
not
just
every
conceivable
thing
you
can
think
of.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
it
from
fear
of
litigation
like
this
that
they
insert
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
they
follow
the
osi?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
the
courts
of
appeal
followed
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
could
by
reading
paragraph
19,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
is
room.
where
do
you
draw
the
line
with
all
these
details?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
a
bigger
front
page.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
a
larger
and
longer
front
page.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it
is
bigger
print,
it
is
a
longer
page
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
there
is
no
rule
of
law
i
have
ever
heard
of
that
doesn't
have
close
cases
and
that
sort
of
thing,
that
breed
litigation.
and
i
would
suspect
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
is
the
same.
are
you
suggesting
that
we
adopt
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
or
that
we
leave
the
circuits
free
to
interpret
--
each
circuit
free
to
interpret
for
itself
what
deference
it
will
give
to
regulation
z
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
uphold
a
part
of
the
staff
interpretation
but
not
all
of
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
reach
that
result?
how
does
one
justify
reaching
that
result?
