mr.
william
m.
burke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
these
cases
is
whether
or
not
the
contractual
right
of
acceleration
in
a
consumer'
credit
contract
must
be
disclosed
under
the
truth
in
lending
act,
or
regulation
z,
promulgated
by
the
federal
reserve
board.
the
right
of
acceleration
is
not
mentioned
anywhere
in
the
specific
disclosure
requirement
of
the
act
or
the
regulation.
in
fact,
acceleration
isn't
mentioned
anywhere
in
any
provision
of
the
act
or
the
regulation.
respondents
have
relied
on
two
different
sections
of
the
regulation
in
an
effort
to
gleam
a
requirement
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
to
disclose
the
acceleration
clause.
in
the
district
court
the
respondents
relied
upon
section
226.8(b)(4)
dealing
with
default
charges
and
i
will
come
to
that
section
in
more
detail
in
a
moment.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
ninth
circuit,
the
respondents
focused
heavily
upon
226.8(b)
(7),
which
was
not
raised
in
the
district
court,
which
deals
with
the
creditor's
rebate
policy
upon
pre-payment
of
the
pre-computed
consumer
credit
contract.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
simple
and
for
the
most
part
are
undisputed.
the
milhollin's
and
mrs.
baton
entered
into
conditional
sale
contracts
with
the
petitioners
for
the
purchase
of
motor
vehicles.
the
contracts
were
immediately
assigned
to
ford
motor
credit
company.
the
contracts
had
provisions
on
both
the
front
and
the
back
side,
with
the
front
side
serving
as
the
petitioner's
disclosure
statement
required
by
the
truth
in
landing
act
and
regulation
z.
the
front
side
clearly
disclosed
all
default
charges
imposed
by
the
petitioners
in
paragraph
12.
paragraph
24
advised
the
respondents
that
in
the
event
they
prepaid
the
consumer
credit
contract
for
any
reason
at
any
time,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
default
in
acceleration,
the
consumer
would
receive
a
rebate
in
full
of
all
unearned
finances
charges.
this
is
consistent,
by
the
way,
with
the
oregon
rebate
statute
which
requires
such
a
rebate
and
was
followed
by
the
creditors
as
[illegible
word]
as
the
record
indicates,
at
all
times
relevant.
the
contract
contained
a
default
clause
which
contained
the
usual
creditor
remedies,
including
the
right
acceleration.
this
clause
was
set
forth
clearly
in
paragraph
19
of
the
contract
on
the
reverse
side,
but
was
not
separately
repeated
on
the
front
side
of
the
contract,
the
disclosure
provisions
of
the
truth
in
lending
act.
the
district
court
could
find
no
provision
of
the
act
or
the
regulation
requiring
disclosure
of
acceleration
clauses.
however,
it
held
that
the
acceleration
clause
should
be
disclosed
under
the
spirit
of
the
act,
henceforth
all
creditors
are
required
to
do
so.
mr.
william
m.
burke
well,
the
provisions
of
the
truth
in
lending
act
require
certain
types
of
disclosures
of
contractual
provisions
in
consumer
credit
contracts;
as
an
example
the
pre-payment
disclosure
semantically
what
the
act
and
regulation
require
is
that
the
creditor
provide
on
the
front
side
and
on
one
page
a
disclosure
of
his
pre-payment
rebate
policy.
so
when
we
talk
about
the
disclosure
we
are
talking
about
certain
specific
enumerated
provisions
of
the
act
and
the
regulation
that
must
be
put
together
on
one
side
and
on,
one
piece
of
paper
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
m.
burke
yes,
226.6
(a),
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
m.
burke
it
is
in
section
226.6(a).
now
the
respondents
fell
into
default
under
the
contracts.
after
efforts
by
ford
motor
credit
to
bring
the
contracts
current
failed,
the
vehicles
were
repossessed
and
these
truth
in
lending
actions
followed
by
the
respondents
against
the
petitioners.
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
decision
held
that
disclosures
of
acceleration
clauses
are
never
required
under
section
226.8(b)
(4),
the
default
charge
provisions
of
regulation
z.
the
court
held
that
when
a
creditor
accelerates
payments,
it
accelerates
the
contract,
it
exercises
the
right
of
acceleration,
that
demand
for
payment
in
itself
a
pre-payment.
and
therefore
was
able
to
hold
under
226.8(b),(7)
the
creditor
must
disclose
whether
it
rebates
finance
charges
upon
acceleration,
and
not
pre-payment.
in
the
process,
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
of
the
federal
reserve
board's
official
staff
interpretation
of
its
own
regulations.
i
might
point
out
here
that
section
226.8(b)(7)
dealing
with
pre-payment,
which
is
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
below,
has
no
counterpart
in
the
act.
this
is
a
provision
only
in
the
regulation
and
has
been
interpreted
by
the
federal
reserve
board
through
its
official
staff
interpretation.
we
submit
that
a
careful
analysis
of
the
applicable
sections
of
the
regulation,
an
application
of
the
federal
reserve
board's
official
staff
interpretation,
and
substantial
policy
consideration
dictate
that
the
court's
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
issued
an
official
staff
interpretation
saying
the
disclosure
requirements
incident
to
an
acceleration
clause,
with
respect
to
ford,
which
is
printed
in
full
in
our
opening
brief,
that
requires
that
the
creditor
disclose
the
amount
or
method
of
computing
the
amount
of
any
default,
delinquency,
or
similar
changes
that
are
payable
in
the
event
of
late
payment.
the
language
in
the
act
is
very
similar.
the
federal
reserve
board
has
include
in
its
official
staff
interpretations
that
the
right
of
acceleration
is
a
creditor
remedy,
it
is
a
contract
right;
it
is
not
an
amount
that
can
be
disclosed,
nor
it
is
payable
with
late
payments
of
contract
installments.
what
the
board
concluded
in
its
osi
is
that
the
right
of
acceleration
need
not
be
disclosed
that
is
what
is
referred
to
in
(b)(4)
is
specific
pecuniary
charges
that
are
payable
with
late
payments
of
the
disclosed
fully
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
in
paragraph
12
or
their
contract.
i
might
note
right
here
that
this
issue
has
been
considered
by
seven
circuit
courts
and
virtually
every
circuit
has
unanimously
agreed
with
the
board
on
this
issue,
that
the
right
of
acceleration
need
not
be
disclosed
under
section
(b)
(4).
there
is
no
conflict
on
that
point.
the
board
has
also
concluded
in
its
osi
that
as
long
as
the
creditor
rebates
under
its
finance
charges,
upon
pre-payment
after
acceleration
in
the
same
manner
that
it
rebates
upon
voluntary
pre-payment,
no
default
charges
are
required.
and
it
is
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
practice
is
followed
in
these
cases.
mr.
william
m.
burke
no
less
burdensome
manner;
you
are
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
submit.
therefore
that
the
petitioner's
forms
in
these
cases
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
the
regulation
as
interpreted
by
the
federal
reserve
board
in
its
official
staff
interpretation.
this,
incidentally,
is
the
position
that
the
united
states
has
been
taken
in
its
brief
filed
by
the
invitation
of
the
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
(b)(7)
that
the
official
staff
interpretation
with
respect
to
(b)(7)
is
that
a
creditor
need
only
disclose
its
rebate
practices
in
general;
it
need
not
disclose
what
its
rebate
practice
is.
and
by
specifically
spelling
out
acceleration,
as
long
as
it
makes
a
general
rebate
disclosure
of
its
rebate
agreement
with
respect
to
pre-payment,
that
is
sufficient.
mr.
william
m.
burke
rule
78,
the
sum
of
the
digits
are
interchangeable.
mr.
william
m.
burke
yes,
s-u-m.
mr.
william
m.
burke
we
submit
that
the
board's
official
staff
interpretation
should
be
followed.
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
consistently
held
that
an
agency
interpretation
of
its
own
regulation
which
is
what
is
involved
here,
should
be
deferred
to
as
long
as
it
is
not
plainly
erroneous,
or
as
long
as
there
are
no
compelling
indications
there.
the
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulation
did
not
give
the
only
possible
construction
of
the
legislation,
nor
what
even
a
court
might
consider
to
be
the
principal
construction,
as
long
as
it
is
plainly
erroneous.
we
also
submit
that
acceptance
of
the
osi
in
this
case
will
further
substantial
policy
considerations
and
will
promote
and
facilitate
the
single
most
important
purpose
of
the
truth
in
lending
act,
and
that
is
to
facilitate
comparison
shopping
by
consumers.
how
will
it
do
this?
it
will
do
it
because
it
will
facilitate
comparison
shopping
for
credit
because
disclosures
can
at
last
be
uniform.
if
responsibility
here
is
placed
with
a
central
agency,
here
the
federal
reserve
board,
rather
than
among
scattered
among
appellate
trial
courts
across
the
land,
it
will
also
facilitate
comparison
shopping
to
credit
because
disclosures
can
be
made
simple
and
shorter
and
uniform
and
more
understandable
to
the
consumers.
once
creditors
realize
that
they
can
place
a
high
degree
of
reliance
upon
the
board
and
staff
interpretations
of
their
own
regulations,
they
will
no
longer
feel
compelled
to
provide
the
lengthy
and
complex
disclosure
forms
that
are
now
provided
in
an
effort
to
anticipate
and
fend
off
litigation
of
this
type.
respondents
in
their
brief
have
urged
this
court
to
amend
the
staff
interpretation
and
to
equate
acceleration
with
pre-payment.
that
this
amendments
implies,
they
claim
that
under
(b)(7)
the
creditor
must
disclosure
whether
it
rebates
finance
charged
upon
acceleration.
the
first
problem
in
this
argument
is
that
acceleration
and
pre-payment
are
distinct
concepts,
they
are
not
the
same.
they
are
logically
and
legally
antithetical
and
so
raises
a
demand
for
payment.
it
is
not
in
any
senses
of
the
word
a
pre-payment
as
claimed
by
the
respondents.
respondents
have
not
cited
any
provision
of
the
act
or
the
regulation
or
any
other
authority,
for
that
matter,
to
support
their
argument
that
acceleration
and
pre-payment
are
identical.
mr.
william
m.
burke
if
there
is
a
pre-payment
following
acceleration,
that
the
board
has
said
is
essentially
a
pre-payment.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
burke
a
payment
following
acceleration
is
a
pre-payment
--
mr.
william
m.
burke
that
is
right.
mr.
william
m.
burke
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
exercise
of
a
right
of
acceleration
may
lead
to
a
pre-payment
but
itself
is
not
a
pre-payment.
the
respondents
have
failed
to
demonstrate
or
really
attempt
to
demonstrate
in
their
briefs
that
the
board's
official
staff
interpretation
is
plainly
erroneous.
petitioners
submit
that
the
osi
is
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
federal
reserve
board
of
its
own
regulation
and
should
be
followed.
in
response
to
the
alternative
disclosure
rule
that
the
respondents
have
asked
this
court
to
accept,
i
can't
put
it
any
better
than
this
court
did
in
the
mourning
case,
a
case
also
dealing
with
regulation
z,
and
i
quote.
"that
some
other
remedial
provision
might
be
preferable
is
irrelevant.
we
have
consistently
held
that
where
reasonable
minds
may
differ
as
to
which
of
several
remedial
measures
should
be
chosen,
courts
should
defer
to
the
informed
experience
and
judgement
of
the
agency
to
whom
congress
delegated
appropriate
authority."
the
solicitor
general
will
now
present
the
view
of
the
united
states
for
ten
minutes,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.
burke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
won't
take
much
more
of
the
court's
time
to
respond.
i
would
like
to
address
a
couple
of
points
that
were
raised
by
mr.
slottee
in
his
presentation.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
want
the
court
left
with
the
impression
that
the
respondents
were
mistreated
in
this
case.
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
23
to
25
indicate
the
substantial
efforts
made
by
ford
to
cause
the
milhollin's
to
bring
their
contract
current,
which
failed.
mrs.
eaton
advised
ford
that
she
could
no
longer
continue
to
make
payments
on
the
contract,
so
ford
accepted
the
vehicle
in
full
discharge
of
the
indebtedness
and
did
not
seek
a
deficiency
judgment.
in
response
to
the
questions
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
mr.
slottee
has
said
that
the
simple
addition
of
two
words
would
solve
this
problem.
the
words
were
that
you
disclose
that
you
will
rebate
upon
pre-payment
or
acceleration.
had
we
added
those
two
simple
words
that
mr.
slottee
says
would
have
solved
all
the
problems,
we
would
be
here
today
with
mr.
slottee
arguing
that
you
don't
rebate
upon
acceleration.
you
have
mis-advised
the
consumer.
you
say
you
will
rebate
upon
pre-payment
or
acceleration,
your
own
affidavits
show
that
you
don't
rebate
on
acceleration.
you
rebate
upon
payment
following
acceleration.
and
we
would
be
litigating
that
question
here
today.
there
has
been
no
change
in
ford
credit's
policy
on
rebate,
as
the
joint
appendix
shows
at
pages
22
and
68.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
emphasizing
the
terrible
dilemma
facing
the
credit
industry
today.
the
dilemma
is
the
central
theme
of
the
three
amicus
curiae
briefs
filed
by
the
consumer
bankers
association,
the
california
bankers
association,
the
national
consumer
finance
association,
joined
by
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.
and
that
dilemma
is
the
consumer
credit
industry
wants
to
comply
with
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
regulation
z
and
it
is
conscientiously
attempting
to
do
so.
however,
the
problem
is
the
industry
can't
place
any
substantial
degree
of
reliance
upon
the
board
and
staff
interpretations
if
courts
such
as
the
court
below
refuse
to
pay
deference
to
those
interpretations.
the
industry
can't
afford
to
change
their
contract
forms
each
time
a
new
case
comes
down
with
an
additional
disclosure
that
that
particular
judge
thought
should
be
provided.
and
at
the
same
time
they
can't
afford
not
to
change
their
forms
because
of
the
punitive
liability
aspects
of
the
act
which
could
be
ruinous
to
small
creditors.
as
a
result,
what
they
are
doing
is
the
logical
thing.
they
are
over-disclosing
in
an
attempt
to
anticipate
and
fond
off
legal
challenges
of
the
type
raised
here.
the
result
is
that
the
disclosure
forms
are
long
--
i
have
seen
forms
that
are
two
or
three
feet
long
--
they
are
confusing,
they
are
non-uniform,
and
that
itself
is
a
violation,
or
could
be
a
violation
of
the
act
and
the
regulation.
we
submit
that
there
is
a
simple
way
out.
and
that
is
if
the
official
staff
interpretation
is
followed
and
applied
in
this
case,
it
will
have
two
healthy
effects.
first,
the
board
will
be
encouraged
to
continue
to
use
its
interpretive
powers
to
attempt
to
bring
some
semblance
of
uniformity
and
simplicity
into
this
area.
this
will
benefit
creditors,
to
be
sure;
but
it
will
also
benefit
consumers,
because
the
forms
can
be
shorter
and
simpler
and
easier
to
understand,
if
creditors
know
that
they
can
place
reliance
upon
the
board's
interpretive
guidelines.
the
second
beneficial
effect
of
following
the
osi
in
this
case
is
it
will
permit
the
system
to
operate
the
way
congress
and
the
board
intended
it
to
operate,
and
that
is
when
the
board
or
the
staff
publishes
an
osi
for
comment
in
the
federal
register,
creditors,
consumers,
any
interested
person
will
make
their
views
known
to
the
board
at
that
time
rather
than
to
wait
until
subsequent
litigation
to
attack
the
board's
views.
the
board
and
staff
can
then
assess
the
views
and
positions
of
all
interested
parties
at
that
time,
which
will
vastly
improve
its
decision-making
process.
in
short,
it
will
no
longer
be
possible
for
an
interest
group
or
a
person
to
sit
back,
allow
an
osi
to
be
published
for
comment,
allow
it
to
become
final,
allow
the
industry
to
rely
upon
it,
and
then
attack
it
in
a
trial
court
action,
attempting
to
convince
a
trial
judge
that
the
board
could
have
done
better,
as
was
done
in
this
case.
we
submit
therefore,
for
all
of
these
reasons,
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
