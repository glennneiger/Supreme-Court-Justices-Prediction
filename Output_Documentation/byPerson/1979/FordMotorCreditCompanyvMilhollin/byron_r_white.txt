justice
byron
r.
white
at
this
point,
with
all
this
is
disarray,
the
board
hasn't
really
done
very
much
by
way
of
rule-making
to
straighten
out
the
disarray,
have
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nothing
by
formal,
rule-making.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
less
the
agency
is
going
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
a
relevant
question
at
this
point
-
is
your
client's
name
misspelled
all
the
way
through
on
court
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
haven't
discharged
you
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
m-u-l.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it'
is
all
right
with
you
to
stay
with
misspelling.
justice
byron
r.
white
two
words
--
you
mentioned
that
before.
where
would
you
put
the
two
words
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
just
as
fine
on
the
front.
you
don't
call
that
big
print
that
you
just
showed
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
still
looks
like
a
lot
of
fine
print
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
the
size
of
the
print
is
the
same;
there
is
a
little
more
space
between
the
lines.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hate
to
be
slow
on
this
but
frankly
i
am.
you
have
said
to
us
two
or
three
times,
you
only
have
to
add
two
or
three
words.
and
you
said
you
add
them
somewhere
in
paragraph
14.
i
can't
figure
out
where
you
add
them.
i
think
you
really
have
to
rewrite
the
whole
paragraph
and
make
it
much
longer.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
adding
two
words,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
this
contract.
you
know
we
have
to
start
somewhere.
it
would
have
to
be
rewritten
with
an
additional
contingency
described,
namely
acceleration.
you
can't
just
throw
the
words
"or
accelerate"
in
the
thing
as
it
is
written
now
--
at
least
i
can't;
and
i
don't
think
you
can.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
still
millions
within
the
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
all
you
need,
then.
i
mean
that
would
satisfy
the
complaint,
because
there
would
be
millions.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
conflicting
case
in
this;
there
was,
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
a
conflicting
decision
with
the
ninth
circuit?
hasn't
there
been
a
court
of
appeals
who
decided
this
case
another
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
in
those
circuits?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
it?
the
court
has
struck
it
down
in
those
circuits.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
you
rely
on
those
circuits
upon
any
staff
interpretation
that
has
been
invalidate
by
a
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
you
be
in
good
faith
if
the
court
has
told
you
that
a
staff
interpretation
is
not
worth
a
nickel?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that
has
been
quite
a
while.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
has
been
a
long
time
go
by
since
those
cases
have
decided
that
the
staff
interpretation
was
wrong.
there
have
been
a
lot
of
creditors
who
certainly
since
then
wouldn't
be
able
to
rely.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
many
millions
have
bought
automobiles
since
then,
or
even
fords?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
subsequent.
how
about
relying
on
it
after
those
cases;
how
about
the
ones
who
relied
on
it
since
those
courts
have
struck
it
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
