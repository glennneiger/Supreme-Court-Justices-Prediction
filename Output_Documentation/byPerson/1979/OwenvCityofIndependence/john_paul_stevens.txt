justice
john
paul
stevens
your
opponent,
of
course,
disagrees
with
you
on
that.
did
he
find
any
cases
that
you
know
of?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
opponent
makes
great
--
poses
great
weight
on
a
distinction
between
a
policy
case
and
a
conduct
case
throughout
his
brief,
which
do
you
say
this
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
carlisle,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
--
the
basic
claim
in
the
case
to
--
to
get
all
these
arguments
in
better
focus.
as
i
understand
that
the
good
faith
defense
rests
largely
on
the
fact
that
the
state
of
the
law
was
uncertain
or
hadn't
developed
at
the
time
of
the
events
in
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
assume
that
the
same
events
took
place
today
and
everybody
knew
the
law,
so
you
wouldn't
have
this
kind
of
a
good
faith
argument,
would
you
agree
that
the
facts
would
support
recovery
by
the
plaintiff
under
1983
against
somebody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
of
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
carlisle,
let
me
carry
the
question
i
asked
you
before
one
step
further.
i
think
i
understand
the
answer,
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
would
you
agree
that
if
the
facts
that
have
been
found
here
occurred
today,
that
the
city
would
be
liable
under
1983?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
and
specifically,
this
is
such
a
case,
unless
we
hold,
that
there
is
good
faith
immunity
for
the
municipality.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
--
i
think
i
understand
you
to
be
arguing
and
in
part
admitting
that
if
the
facts
we
have
before
us
occurred
today,
so
there
was
no
good
faith
immunity
defense
available,
the
city
would
be
liable
which
--
the
converse
of
which
is
that
you
are
saying,
in
essence,
that
you
are
relying
squarely
on
good
faith
immunity
as
the
reason
the
city
is
not
liable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
true,
may
i
ask
you,
because
i
really
didn't
find
you
addressing
this
very
much.
why
should
--
what
--what
is
there
in
the
law
to
support
the
notion
that
in
a
situation
in
which
a
city
would
otherwise
be
liable,
it
should
be
immune
from
liability
because
of
the
good
faith
of
its
officials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
rather
unusual
to
have
an
affirmative
defense
relate
back
to
the
prima
facie
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
pecuniae
then
as
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
support
your
position
on
that.
pecuniae
against
never
as
to
support
you
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
fairness
to
you
then,
mr.
carlisle,
you
really
want
to
withdraw
your
answer
to
one
of
my
questions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
really
accept,
for
purposes
of
decision,
the
proposition
that
if
this
conduct
occurred
today,
it
would
be
liability
against
anybody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
--
what
i
really
meant
to
ask
you,
and
i
--
because
there
are
so
many
issues
that
crisscrossing
the
case,
is
assuming
you
didn't
have
a
qualified
immunity
defense
at
all
because
of
the
fact
that
it
occurred
today
and
there's
no
matter
of
unsettled
law
or
anything
else,
just
on
the
basic
facts
of
the
case,
i
was
asking
you
whether
or
not
you
were
contending
that
there
would
be
no
liability
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
the
argument
that
there's
not
a
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
because
you
don't
regard
these
--
these
comments
as
stigma,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
because
(a)
we're
not
stigmatizing
or
(b)
we're
not
in
connection
with
the
discharge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
still
a
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
got
three
possible
arguments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one,
not
stigma
and
two,
not
in
connection
and
three,
they've
been
cured.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
know
which
are
you
relying
on
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright,
and
do
you
--
but
you
deny
that
they
are
in
connection
with
the
discharge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
also
argue
that
they
were
cured
in
any
event.
