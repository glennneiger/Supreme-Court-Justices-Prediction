well,
you
return
the
distinction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
the
respondent,
city
of
independence,
missouri
discharged
its
chief
of
police.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
acts
of
the
officials
involved
in
effecting
the
discharge
were
taken
pursuant
to
official
city
policy
and
constituted
a
depravation
by
the
city
of
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest
of
the
police
chief
giving
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
in
his
favor
against
the
city
and
its
officials
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
held
further
that
the
chief
of
police
must
be
denied
any
relief
against
either
the
city
or
its
officials
because
the
officials
acted
in
good
faith
and
without
malice.
in
that
circumstance
the
court
of
appeals
held
a
qualified
immunity
from
liability
was
enjoyed
not
only
by
the
officials
but
also
by
the
city.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
public
officials,
individually,
enjoyed
a
qualified
immunity
but
we
reversed
the
judgment
that
the
city
also
enjoyed
a
like
immunity.
we
hold
that
a
municipality
has
no
immunity
from
liability
under
section
1983
flowing
from
its
constitutional
violations
and
may
not
assert
the
good
faith
of
its
officers
as
a
defense
to
such
liability.
our
reasons
were
differing
between
the
city
and
its
officials
in
this
matter
of
immunity
are
stated
at
length
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
