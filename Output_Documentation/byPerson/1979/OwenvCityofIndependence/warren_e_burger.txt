mr.

may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
i,
now,
after
these
--
these
several
colloquies,
distinguish
between
what
you
have
described
as
policy
and
what
was
implementation
or
execution
of
the
policy.
was
the
declaration
in
the
council
meeting
the
policy
and
the
action
the
next
morning
by
the
city
manager
the
action?
is
that
the
dichotomy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
--
the
dividing
line
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
dividing
line
that
you've
drawn
is
between
the
ordinance
and
the
action
taken
pursuant
to
it
by
the
council.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
he'll
clarify
that
for
us.
thank
you.

e.
burger
mr.
carlisle.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
could
only
be
dismissed
for
cause
in
the
sense
that
it
was
defined
that
it's
for
the
good
of
the
services.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
--
is
--
is
that
why
you
say
that
there
would
be
no
point
or
purpose
to
a
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

case
is
