justice
potter
stewart
the
--
was
the
trial
before
or
after
our
decision
in
the
monell
case,
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
remanded.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
just
so
i
can
get
this
in
mind.
i
think
i
have
it.
the
--
the
trial
was
before
monell.
justice
potter
stewart
the
trial
was
before
the
monell
case
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
trial
court
judgment
was
before
the
monell
case,
and
that
judgment
exonerated
the
individuals
based
on
wood
against
strickland.
justice
potter
stewart
denied
relief
entirely?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
with
--
and
with
respect
to
the
individual
defendants,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
wood
against
strickland.
and
with
respect
to
the
city,
the
first
time
around,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
also
was,
of
course,
before
the
monell
decision
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
your
brother
on
the
other
side,
i
suppose,
petitioned
for
certiorari.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
had
won.
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
you
had
prevailed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
monell
was
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
this
court
remanded
the
--
vacated
the
judgment,
remanded
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
--
to
reconsider
it
in
the
light
of
monell.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
found
that
the
city
was
not
liable
because
that
the
city,
too,
had
an
equivalent
immunity
to
that
of
the
individual
defendants.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
the
question
of
my
brother
white
suggests,
in
the
era
in
which
this
federal
statute
was
enacted,
the
general
doctrine
was
that
a
city
had
sovereign
immunity
for
any
liability
of
its
governmental
activities
and
it
was
liable
only
for
its
so-called
proprietary
activities.
wasn't
that
the
generally
accepted
law
of
municipal
corporations
in
the
states?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that,
but
wasn't
that
the
--
wasn't
that
the
generally
accepted
law
in
that
era?
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
definitional
problem
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
exist
and
existed
then,
the
law
was
that
a
--
that
a
municipality
was
sovereign
immune
--
because
of
its
sovereign
capacity,
was
immune
for
liability
for
any
of
its
governmental
activities
but
was
liable
for
its
so-called
proprietary
activities
only.
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
--
wasn't
that
the
general
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
well,
that
question
can
be
answered
yes
or
no.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
monell
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
came
along
and
held
that,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
under
1983,
a
city
is
no
longer
immune
for
its
governmental
activities.
justice
potter
stewart
under
1983.
justice
potter
stewart
or
any
of
its
activities
under
1983.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
point
is
that
it
--
that
it
was
--
that
the
historic
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
1983
was
that
a
city
was
immune,
completely
immune
for
its
governmental
activities,
whatever
they
--
those
might
be,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
right.
that's
what
immunity
means.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
anybody
can
sue
anybody
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
defendant
can
immediately
say
“look,
i'm
a
municipality
and
what
is
my
wrong
--
alleged
wrongdoing
was
a
matter
of
my
governmental
activities”
and
that's
a
complete
defense
or
used
to
be
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
anybody
can
sue
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
now,
whose
statement,
roberts'
statement?
justice
potter
stewart
was
--
mr.
owen
was
the
chief
of
police.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
such,
was
he
an
independence,
under
the
charter,
a
department
head?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
nobody
between
him
and
the
city
manager,
there
was
no
safety
director
or
anybody
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
the
department
head
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
directly
under
the
city
manager.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
have
to
do
with
the
extent
of
damages,
perhaps,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
job
offers
that
were
made
that
might
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
amount
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
certiorari
(inaudible).
