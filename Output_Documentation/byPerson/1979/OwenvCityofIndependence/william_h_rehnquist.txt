justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
get
to
the
immunity
question,
counsel,
what
do
you
have
here
by
way
of
liability
against
the
city
other
than
a
respondeat
superior
theory?
as
i
--
as
i
understood
monell,
i
was
in
dissent
but,
as
i
understood
the
court's
opinion,
you
had
to
have
either
a
policy
or
a
custom.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
a
municipal
corporation
can
proceed
only
through
individuals.
i
--
it
--
it's
simply
an
abstraction
in
the
law.
if
--
if
this
were
simply
an
isolated
instance
of
a
city
official
refusing
to
give
a
hearing,
do
you
think
you
would
have
anything
other
than
respondeat
superior?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
--
do
you
think
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
applies
only
to
low-level
employees
that
it
cannot
be
used
to
impose
liability
on
the
--
the
highest
official
of
the
municipal
corporation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
imputed
to
the
city
by
reason
of
respondeat
superior.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
what,
in
addition
to
respondeat
superior,
you
say
was
official
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
official
policy
referred
to
in
monell
would
require
an
affirmative
policy
protecting
constitutional
rights
or
simply
a
--
would
require
a
policy
which
contravened
constitutional
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
united
states
of
america
has
sovereign
immunity
and
it's
nonetheless
sueable.
it
comes
in
and
raises
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
and
then,
the
question
is
has
congress
waived
that
defense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
--
it's
sueable.
it's
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
stewart
says,
anybody
can
sue
anybody.
the
question
is
will
the
suit
be
allowed
to
proceed
to
the
merits
or
is
there
some
form
of
immunity
that
will
prevent
it
from
doing
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
city
of
independence
simply
had
an
individual
police
officer
who
felt
that
blacks
should
not
be
in
the
city
after
a
certain
time.
the
city
had
no
ordinance,
no
policy,
nothing
like
it.
it
never
approved
it,
but
this
individual
officer
simply
took
it
on
himself
to
try
to
see
that
what
he
believed
to
be
the
proper
policy
was
enforced.
would
you
have
anything
more
there
than
respondeat
superior?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
by
official
action,
you
mean
an
ordinance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
relying
on
page
83
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
wherein
judge
bright's
opinion
on
re
--
after
the
remand
of
this
court,
he
says
"the
pertinent
facts
are
set
forth
in
our
prior
opinion"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it,
this
is
an
argument
then
that
you're
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
you
disagree
that
there
was
a
policy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
thought
there
was
a
policy
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
but
thought
there
was
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
arguing
no
immunity,
you're
arguing
no
policy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
right
now,
you're
arguing
no
policy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
even
if
it
was
policy
that
it
would
still
be
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
city
council
had
specifically
ordered
that
no
hearing
be
granted
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
they
--
and
then
they,
in
implementation
of
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
it
isn't
granted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
supposing
that
you
have
an
ordinance
that
is
exactly
the
converse
of
what
my
brother
white
is
suggesting
that
says,
in
every
case
of
the
firing
of
a
department
head,
there
shall
be
the
opportunity
for
a
hearing
conducted
by
the
city
manager.
the
city
manager,
flatly
contrary
to
that
ordinance,
refuses
to
conduct
such
a
hearing
and
discharges
him
anyway.
he
is
an
employee
of
the
city.
he
is
presumably
liable
under
respondeat
superior
theory,
but
you
have
nothing
else.
now,
under
monell,
you
don't
have
any
liability
there,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
--
you
have
in
this
case,
don't
you,
as
in
so
many
cases
of
this
kind,
different
elements
that
are
very
easily
kind
of
interchangeable
and
not
easy
to
separate?
first,
the
constitutional
violation
which
could
occur.
any
employee
could
violate
the
defendant's
--
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights.
and
then,
you
have
the
respondeat
superior
plus
requirement
of
monell
which
says
that
even
if
an
individual
employee
has
violated
a
constitutional
right,
the
city
can't
be
held
liable
unless
you
show
something
more
than
respondeat
superior.
and
then,
you
have
elements
of
damages
and
mitigation,
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
what
has
fraud
got
to
do
with
the
constitutional
violation
with
1983?
