mr.
irving
achtenberg
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
which
arose
out
of
the
termination
of
the
employment
of
the
chief
of
police
of
independence,
missouri
in
the
year
1972
by
his
employer,
the
city
of
independence.
the
petitioner,
the
chief
of
police,
believing
that
his
termination
was
under
circumstances
which
gave
rise
to
a
denial
of
procedure
of
due
process
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
which
he
sought
appropriate
relief
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
42
u.s.c.
1983.
he
was
denied
relief
by
the
district
court
and
took
an
appeal
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
eight
circuit,
reversing
the
trial
court,
found
that
he
had
in
fact
suffered
a
stigma
arising
in
the
course
of
the
termination
of
his
employment
occasioned
by
the
acts
of
the
highest
officials
of
the
city
which
gave
rise
to
a
right
of
procedural
due
process
and
reversed
the
trial
court,
ordering
declaratory
relief,
as
well
as
damages.
the
court
bottomed
its
denial
of
recovery
against
the
individual
officials
of
the
city
in
their
individual
capacities
on
this
court's
decision
in
wood
versus
strickland.
it
said,
however,
that
the
decision
in
wood
did
not
prevent
it
from
finding
entity
liability
against
the
city.
based
upon
that
favorable
--
that
decision
unfavorable
against
the
city,
the
city
sought
and
was
--
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
before
this
court.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
trial
was
prior
to
monell.
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
before
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
monell.
while
this
--
while
the
petition
was
pending
before
this
court
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
monell
was
handed
down
and
this
court
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
remanded,
vacating
the
decision
in
light
of
monell
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
to
the
eighth
circuit.
the
eighth
circuit
then
proceeded
without
changing
any
of
its
prior
findings,
without
contradicting
its
prior
findings
as
to
stigma,
denied
all
relief
taking
the
position
which
we
think
was
a
totally
unjustified
leap
with
wood
versus
--
from
wood
versus
strickland
to
monell
that,
now,
in
light
of
monell,
the
city
as
an
entity
had
the
same
immunity,
the
same
good
faith
immunity,
as
it
had
previously
given
the
individual
council
members
under
the
tree
of
wood
versus
strickland.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no,
sir.
the
trial
court
denied
relief.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
the
trial
court,
still
prior
to
monell.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
with
regard
to
the
city?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
granted
relief
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
both
declaratory
and
equitable
relief.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
is
correct,
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
and
the
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
in
fact,
monell
had
not
served
and
decide
it.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
and
it
was
while
this
court
was
considering
the
petition
for
certiorari
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
that
it
handed
down
monell.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
correct.
and
it's
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
can
only
say
with
the
court
en
banc
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
its
rehearing
on
bertot,
that
the
court
simply
made
an
inextricable
flip-flop.
it
took
a
leap
from
wood
versus
strickland,
passed
monell
without
explanation.
if
the
court
will
read
the
opinion,
you
will
find
that
there
is
no
justification
except
that
the
court
simply
says
that
in
light
of
monell,
we
believe
that
the
city
has
the
same
rights,
same
immunities
as
an
entity
that
the
individual
councilman
and
the
city
manager
had.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we
find
no
rationale,
no
change
of
facts,
no
findings
different
than
in
the
prior
decision.
it
is
simply
a
leap
from
how
the
court
must
have
felt
that
what
this
court
clearly,
we
thought,
said,
“we
rule
for
another
day,”
it
in
fact
had
decided.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
certainly
can't
speak
for
the
eighth
circuit,
but
i
can
speak
for
myself.
i
do
not
see
anything
in
their
opinion
which
gives
any
explanation
from
making
that
judgment
based
on
monell.
and
if
i
may
be
so
presumptive
in
reading
monell,
i
find
nothing
in
monell.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
exactly.
i
think
the
--
the
issue
is
fairly
framed
before
this
court
and
that
is,
is
a
good
faith
immunity
which
was
granted
to
individual
city
officials
in
their
individual
capacity
under
this
court's
decision
in
wood
versus
strickland
is
that
to
be
extended
in
this
case
and
in
future
cases
to
the
--
the
local
governmental
entity
as
an
entity?
our
answer
to
that
question
is
a
strong
no.
we
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
as
the
eighth
circuit
on
remand
found,
considering
the
point
raised
in
monell
that
it
must
not
be
respondeat
superior
and
that
it
must
be
official
action.
the
court
had
no
difficulty,
and
nor
do
i,
in
finding
that
the
conduct
of
which
the
plaintiff
--
the
petitioner
complained
was
official
action
of
the
city.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
was
based
upon
the
denial
of
a
hearing
upon
his
termination
which
was
a
part
of
the
charter
provisions
of
the
city.
it
was
based
on
city
ordinance
and
the
action
of
the
highest
officials,
the
city
manager
and
the
city
council,
in
proceeding
under
that
ordinance.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
if
we
were
speaking
of
the
action
of
the
city
council,
in
light
of
a
city
ordinance,
denying
such
hearing
--
well,
first
of
all,
i
--
i
think
i
have
ignored
the
circumstances
of
the
termination
which
involved
the
entire
action
of
the
council,
the
entire
action
of
the
city
manager,
great
publicity,
and
we
have
the,
of
course,
the
--
the
liberty
issue
of
stigma
which
gave
rise
to
the
procedure
of
due
process
right.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
question
of
whether
or
not
an
inferior
employee
had
simply
taken
some
action
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
under
which
he
would
not
be
liable
for
respondeat
superior.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
certainly,
as
an
inanimate
person,
the
city
cannot
act
except
through
its
officials.
and
if
it
is
to
have
action
subject
to
the
provisions
of
1983,
that
action
must
be
by
some
officials.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
and
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
the
highest
officials
of
the
city.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
do
not
see
so,
sir.
i
--
i
--
as
i
see
it,
the
city
acts
per
se
through
its
highest
officials.
it
can
act
no
other
way.
the
--
the
acts
of
lower
officials
in
routine
duties
clearly
might
involve
the
question
of
respondeat
superior.
i
do
not
say
that,
perhaps,
a
higher-level
official
might
have
an
element
of
respondeat
superior.
i
simply
say,
in
this
case,
we
have
the
--
the
official
conduct
of
the
city.
we
have
official
policy
based
on
an
ordinance
acted
upon
by
the
highest
officials
of
the
city,
and
we
see
no
higher
level
of
--
of
functioning
in
which
a
city
can
perform.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
(voice
overlap)
the
eighth
circuit
had
no
trouble
and
we
have
no
trouble
of
saying
this
was
official
policy.
this
was
an
implementation
of
official
policy.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we
says
so
in
the
eighth
circuit
despite
holding
to
the
--
against
us
in
its
remand
said
this
is
now
under
--
because
of
monell,
is
under
183
and
it
clearly
is
official
policy
of
the
city.
it
was
the
implementation
of
official
policy.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
suppose
it
could
be
either.
in
this
case,
we
believe
it
--
it
contravened
a
constitutional
right.
under
1983,
it
says
no
person
shall
deprive
any
person
of
privilege
and
immunities
or
who
shall
provide
shall
be
liable.
in
--
i
think
we
--
this
certainly
fits
that
direct
statement
of
the
statute,
whether
--
whether
it
may
apply
in
another
situation
is
--
is
irrelevant
to
this
case,
as
i
see
it.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
as
i
understand
the
question,
i
think
not.
it
goes
back
to
the
--
to
the
fundamental
function
that
--
fundamental
concept
that
they
are
acting
in
the
only
way
that
a
city
can
act.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
the
ordinance
denies
the
right
to
a
hearing
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
on
termination.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
is
correct,
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we
--
we
would
see
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we
--
we
think
it
would
still
be
a
denial
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
1983.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
pardon
me.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
think
it
projects
--
the
question
projects
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case.
you're
talking
about
the
interlinking
action
of
the
city
council
and
the
city
manager.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
not
only
there
was
an
ordinance,
there
was
action
by
the
city
council
the
night
before
which,
inextricably,
was
interlinked
with
his
action
the
following
morning.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
we
don't
see
it
as
a
dichotomy.
we
--
i
think
the
policy
was
the
city
ordinance
which
did
not
grant
a
hearing.
the
implementation
of
that
policy
was
not
only
the
action
of
the
city
council
at
its
formal
council
meeting
directing
the
city
manager
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
and
that
interlinked
with
the
action
of
the
city
manager
the
next
morning.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
we
consider
them
both
under
the
concept
of
official
policy
or
implementation
of
official
policy
which
we
think
this
court
viewed
in
monell
as
official
action
or
as
not
--
not
subject
to
an
immunity.
in
reaching
our
conclusion,
we
have
attempted
to
follow
the
analogy
which
this
court
had
followed
in
all
its
decisions
in
which
it
has
considered
the
individual
immunity
of
various
local
governmental
officials
when
the
question
has
arisen,
beginning
with
what
we
view
as
a
seminal
case
of
tenney
versus
brandhove.
now,
we
think
that
analysis,
which
we
have
tried
to
follow,
as
applied
by
the
court,
begins,
first,
with
the
premise
that
this
is
the
interpretation
of
a
statute,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
it
is
a
construction
of
a
statute
and
in
so
doing,
the
court,
in
each
cases,
said,
first
of
all,
this
is
a
remedial
statute
which
must
be
broadly
construed.
we
--
it
is
mandatory
in
its
language
to
find
any
exceptions
or
any
immunities
thereunder.
we
must
look
to
the
history,
to
the
common-law
and
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
are
any
well-established
common-law
exceptions
which
we
can
properly
feel
were
incorporated
sub
silentio,
without
comment,
in
the
statute.
because
of
their
very
nature,
they
must
have
been
known
and
implicitly
incorporated
by
the
42d
congress.
i
think
the
court
commented,
many
of
whose
members
were
lawyers
themselves
and
well-aware
of
the
common-law.
now,
that
analysis
is
logical
and
reasonable.
the
converse
is
not
true.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
logical
and
it
is
not
reasonable
to
import
an
immunity
to
create
an
immunity
for
cities
which
did
not
exist
at
common-law,
which
was
not
well-established,
and
which
not
was
a
matter
of
history.
and,
we
--
therefore,
we
search
that
point
extensively,
and
we
were
greatly
assisted
by
the
brief
of
the
nea
and
we
reached
the
conclusion
that
we
could
not
find
a
case
in
which
where
a
city
was
sueable,
it
had
any
immunity.
now,
we
cannot
say
that
there
is
not
some
case
which
neither
the
nea
nor
we
could
discover,
but
we
certainly
can
say
that
we
have
sufficiently
researched
the
extensive
cases
of
the
19th
century
state
courts
of
this
country
and
if
we
were
unable
to
find
any,
then
they
certainly
could
have
not
reached
the
level
of
a
well-established
common-law
immunity.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we
do
not
recall
that
he
cited
any
cases
in
the
19th
century
in
which
there
was
a
--
a
--
if
a
city
was
sueable,
that
it
had
any
immunity.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
where
there
was
--
the
--
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity,
of
course,
was
answered
by
this
court
in
monell
and
it
--
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine,
which
was
a
constantly
shifting
doctrine,
did
not
apply
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
where
a
statute
had
subjected
the
city
to
suit.
here's
a
statute,
not
just
a
state
statute,
of
course,
if
there
had
been
a
state
statute,
the
state
had
relinquished
sovereign
immunity
in
that
case.
here's
a
federal
statute
which
certainly
subjected
a
city,
regardless
of
sovereign
immunity,
to
suit.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
the
--
the
problem
was
not
with
the
words
“governmental
propriety”
but
with
the
definition
of
those
words.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
to
the
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
our
problem,
sir,
is
that
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
answer
is
--
is
yes
as
to
the
wording
of
that
concept.
the
concept
is
--
was
a
fuzzy
one.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it's
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
under
1983.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
is
true,
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
it
was
immune
when
it
could
not
be
sued.
if
it
could
be
sued
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
not
so,
sir.
i
think,
in
all
our
discussions,
we
talk
about
immunities
when,
sometimes,
we
are
talking
about
defenses.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
immunity
is
--
is
not
being
subject
to
suit.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
that
is
correct.
once
the
--
first
of
all,
if
there
was
no
statute
taking
--
granting
a
right
of
suit
or
creating
a
liability,
which,
of
course,
we
feel
has
been
created
by
1983
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
this
court's
answer
in
monell
was
that
it
was
sueable.
i
think
we're
also
--
have
the
problem
that
the
--
we're
talking
again
about
what
could
the
82d
--
the
42d
congress
intend
in
1871,
and
we
look
at
the
prior
to
1871
cases,
and
in
our
brief,
we
start
with
which
--
with
what
we
consider
the
significant
thayer
of
--
thayer
versus
the
city
of
boston.
now,
that
was
the
case
of
a
--
a
city
which
was
sued,
which
did
make
a
good
faith
defense.
the
court
said
there
was
no
good
faith
defense
and
the
city
was
viable
and
the
case
is
particularly
significant
because
it
was
discussed
in
the
debates
by
senator
stevenson
in
the
debates
on
the
civil
rights
act.
and
so,
the
court
--
the
congress
was
clearly
aware
that
the
city
--
cities
could
be
sued.
and
nevertheless,
it
had
the
opportunity,
the
congress
had
the
opportunity,
and
it
still
came
out
with
a
very
explicit
and
a
very
broad
statute
which,
in
its
face,
clearly
included
cities.
and
that
was
its
intention.
and
we
think
this
court
is
governed
by
its
intention.
it
is
not
a
prudential
matter.
it
is
not
a
matter
for
this
court
to
weigh
on
policy
or
what
is
right
or
wrong.
it
is
what
did
the
42d
congress
intend.
going
back
to
the
question
of
the
governmental
proprietary
distinction,
perhaps
an
illustration
might
make
it
--
might
make
our
position
at
least
clearer.
let
us
say,
for
example,
that
a
city
had
adopted
an
ordinance
which
said
that
blacks
could
not
be
within
the
city
after
6
o'clock
at
night.
now,
that
would
be
clearly
an
--
in
the
performance
of
its
governmental
activities,
but
we
certainly
do
not
conceive
that
that
ordinance
or
the
enforcement
of
that
ordinance
would
stand
up
under
the
dictates
of
--
of
section
1983,
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no,
sir.
i
--
i
think
i
should
make
it
clear,
having
answered
clearly,
no,
that
we
are
not
suggesting
there
are
no
limitations,
there
are
no
immunities,
if
you
will,
no
defenses
created
by
monell
or
--
or
defined
by
monell.
certainly,
there
was
respondeat
superior
and
certainly
there
was,
perhaps,
the
opposite
of
that
concept,
official
action.
and
we
say
that
is
not
a
small
deterrent.
that
is
not
a
small
limitation.
these
two
requirements
do
not
leave
us
with
a
broad
unlimited
scope
of
attack
upon
cities.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
it
would
not
necessarily
need
to
be
an
ordinance.
in
this
case,
we
--
we
think
it
was
both.
it
was
an
ordinance.
the
implima
--
implementa
--
well,
more
than
both,
it
--
we
see
it
as
following
all
the
language
of
monell.
the
--
the
official
action
constituted
an
ordinance,
the
implementation
an
--
of
an
ordinance
and
the
official
action
of
the
highest
authorities
of
the
city,
the
city
council
and
the
city
manager.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
pardon
me,
sir.
with
one
limitation,
that
was
"when
necessary
for
the
good
of
the
service".
that
was
the
language
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
in
this
case,
we
say
that
judgment
was
the
combined
judgment
initiated
with
the
action
of
the
city
council
and
implemented
by
the
city
manager.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
there
might
be
a
case
where
he
acted
without
the
character
of
this
case,
totally
without
consultation
with
the
council,
totally
on
his
own.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
was
the
district
court's
finding.
we
frankly
think
it
is
not
exactly
based
on
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
the
evidence
which
was
that
he
had
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
certainly,
given
strong
consideration
and
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
was
contemplating
firing
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
--
the
court,
on
appeal,
found
no
difficulty
with
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
--
well
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
can't
recall
whether
they
specifically
directed
to
--
to
that,
but
the
--
the
eighth
circuit
clearly
linked
the
action
of
the
city
council
with
the
action
of
the
city
manager.
and
so
regardless
of
what
he
had
intended
or
what
he
might
have
done,
which
in
fact,
of
course,
nobody
really
knows
because
it
didn't
happen
that
way,
the
eighth
circuit
had
no
problem
with
finding
that
the
--
the
action
of
the
city
council
was
inextricably
connected
with
this
action
the
following
morning
in
which
the
city
manager
not
only
followed
the
direction
of
the
council
but
publicly
announced
that
he
was
referring
the
matter
to
the
grand
jury
and
was
taking
appropriate
action,
which
was
the
direction
and
the
motion
of
the
council.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
think
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
he
was
a
member
of
the
council
who
was
a
lame
duck
councilman.
that
was
his
last
council
meeting,
why
he's
not
a
party
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
this
suit.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we'd
--
we'd
--
well
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
is
a
part
of
our
case.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
in
this
case,
we
--
we
are
--
our
case
is
obviously
bottomed
on
roth.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it's
--
it's
on
--
no,
no,
sir.
it's
on
the
stigma.
the
--
the
--
first
of
all,
the
statement
was
not
simply
a
statement.
it
was
a
serious
charge,
perhaps
the
most
serious
charge
of
any
of
the
stigma
cases
that
i
have
read.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
roberts'
statement.
and
roberts'
statement
which
was
a
printed
statement,
a
--
rather,
a
typed
statement,
fully
prepared,
included
a
formal
councilman's
motion.
that
statement
and
motion
which
was
--
you
might
say
that
--
that
the
--
the
allegations
were
the
whereas
of
the
resolution.
the
motion
was
made
that
they
refer
the
statement
--
the
investigative
statements
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
action
by
the
grand
jury
that
the
--
or
rather,
that
the
city
manager
be
directed
to
do
so,
that
he
take
appropriate
action
against
those
persons
who
were
found
to
have
acted
improperly
and
that
even
further,
that
the
statements
themselves
be
released
to
the
press.
now,
this
was
not
the
action
of
a
single
councilman
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
it
simply
began
with
a
statement,
then
a
motion,
then
formal
action
by
the
council,
then
the
following
morning
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
the
compliance
with
the
direction
of
that
resolution
by
the
city
manager.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
both.
we
--
we
do
not
say
that
monell
made
any
distinction
between
conduct.
the
--
the
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
the
monell
speaks
of
--
of
policy
or
the
implementation
of
policy
by
the
highest
authorities
of
the
city,
and
we
view
this
as
involving
elements
of
both.
you
can't
--
you
can't
act
without
conduct.
we,
frankly,
did
not
follow
the
reasoning
of
that
brief
in
that
respect.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
thank
you.
