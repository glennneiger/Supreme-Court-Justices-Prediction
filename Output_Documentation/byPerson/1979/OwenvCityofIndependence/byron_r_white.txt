justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
a
city
ordinance
as
passed
by
the
city
council
that
says
the
city
manager
shall
do
the
following
and
orders
him
to
do
it,
order
--
orders
him
to
take
some
action,
and
he
does
it
and
the
city
sued,
and
the
other
case
is
the
city
council
authorizes
him
to
do
it?
it
doesn't
order
him
to,
just
authorizes
him.
it
wouldn't
be
--
it
would
be
consistent
with
their
policy
if
he
did
it.
it
doesn't
order
him
to,
and
he
does
it
and
it's
--
the
city
gets
sued,
do
you
think
there's
any
difference
between
those
two
cases
for
the
purposes
of
--
of
monell
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you've
got
one
--
you've
got
something
like
that
here,
haven't
you?
at
least
you've
got
an
ordinance
that
author
--
that
you
say
authorizes
what
was
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
and
--
and
so
it
--
so
the
ordinance
--
whoever
went
ahead
and
denied
the
hearing,
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
ordinance.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
--
take
the
third
case
that
the
--
let's
assume
there
was
no
ordinance
here
at
all,
one
way
or
another,
about
a
hearing
but
the
--
the
executive
officers
of
the
city
just
deny
a
hearing,
and
then
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
city
is
sued.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
you
know?
how
would
you
know
that
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
it's
a
city
policy?
what
if
the
charter
says
the
--
the
charter
reserves
the
--
the
city
council
of
policy
making
authority
in
the
city
and
the
city
managers
and
executives
just
executes?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
need
to
go
any
further
than
to
say
that
--
that
whether
the
city
manager
could
do
it
on
his
own
or
not,
here,
there's
an
ordinance.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
--
the
problem
is
--
the
problem,
because
there
was
sovereign
immunity
for
--
for
municipalities
with
respect
to
part
of
their
functions.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
more
than
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
of
its
activities.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
conduct
alone.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
--
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
policy
and
--
and
policy
implemented
by
conduct?
i
guess
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
never
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
never
have
any
problem
unless
it's
implemented.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
city
wouldn't
--
the
city
wouldn't
be
liable.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
would
the
--
when
would
the
--
if
there's
any
rule
that
a
city
shouldn't
be
liable
on
a
respondeat
superior
basis,
when
would
that
ever
apply
if
it
--
if
it
didn't
apply
when
an
employee,
contrary
to
policy,
acting
on
his
own
in
bad
faith,
hurt
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
you
want
to
--
that
isn't
the
ground
the
court
of
appeals
used.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
you
say
it
wasn't.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
contravened
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
for
you
to
win,
do
we
have
to
overturn
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
to
disagree
with
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
let's
--
let's
suppose
that
there
was
a
city
ordinance
or
a
provision
in
the
charter
that
says
that
whenever
any
department
heads
are
discharged,
no
hearing
shall
be
--
the
--
the
city
manager
has
complete
discretion
and
he
--
and
when
he
discharges
them,
no
hearing
shall
be
ever
given.
that's
just
what
the
charter
says.
i
suppose
you
would
say
that's
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let's
just
say
the
city
manager
discharges
somebody,
a
hearing
is
demanded,
and
he
denies
it
saying
“i
can't
grant
one.
the
city
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
say
the
city
--
you
wouldn't
say
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
city
is
--
has
a
qualified
immunity
there,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
whole
question
is
whether
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
whole
question
in
the
case
then
is
whether
there's
policy
or
not,
not
whether
there's
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
want
us
to
--
you
do
want
us
then
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
just
clearly
wrong
on
saying
there
was
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
argue
that
if
there
was
no
policy,
there
wasn't
any
--
any
liability
at
all,
qualified
or
not.
that
you
just
--
you
just
--
otherwise,
it's
just
liability
on
a
respondeat
superior
basis
which
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
never.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
still
don't
know
what
you
do
with
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
there
was
--
that
there
was
policy
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
i
suppose
if
you
are
a
respondent,
you
could
probably
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
wasn't
policy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
--
and
that
you
didn't
cross-petition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there's
policy
and
there's
just
implementation
of
a
city
policy
involved
here,
i
don't
know
how
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
--
now,
if
you
--
if
you
agree
that
the
pure
implementation
of
a
policy,
of
an
admitted
policy,
would
--
would
not
--
that
there
would
be
no
immunity
there.
now
--
and
then
--
if
--
and
if
you
agreed
in
this
case
that
here
was
a
policy
involved
that
the
city
manager
was
implementing,
you
would
say
no
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
know
you
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
let's
suppose
you
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
if
the
charter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
if
the
charter
said
the
city
--
the
city
manager
has
--
has
broad
executive
powers
and
he
has
powers
to
issue
regulations
to
carry
out
provisions
of
this
charter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
he
issues
a
set
of
regulations
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
says
“in
--
in
furtherance
of
my
power
of
discharge,
here
is
the
procedure”.
there
isn't
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
procedure
and
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
fires
a
man
and
no
--
no
hearing.
is
that
city
policy
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
city
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event,
there
would
be
no
qualified
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
there
was
stigma
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so
--
and
to
the
extent
that
it's
a
respondent,
you
rely
on
the
contrary.
you
are
in
--
going
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
is
your
privilege
--
which
is
your
privilege.
