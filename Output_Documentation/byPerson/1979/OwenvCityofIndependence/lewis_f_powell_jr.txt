justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
these
facts?
the
city
charter
explicitly
authorizes
the
city
manager,
as
i
understand
it,
to
discharge
any
position
that
the
manager
has
authority
to
fill.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
your
position
that
that
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
who
makes
that
judgment?
the
city
manager
has
the
sole
discretion
to
make
that
judgment.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
didn't
this
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
my
recollection
is
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
city
manager
already
had
decided
to
discharge
the
police
chief
prior
to
the
action
of
the
council.
is
that
correct?

did

justice
lewis

did
it

if
the
city
manager
had
agreed,
had
decided
to
discharge
your
client
prior
to
the
action
of
the
council,
where
does
that
leave
your
case?
justice

did
the
city
manager
ever
endorse
roberts'
statement?

robert

roberts
was
a
member
of
the

your

your

it
doesn't?

justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
roberts
hadn't
made
any
statement.
what
would
your
case
be?
the
city
council
merely
refers
a
report
to
the
city
attorney
for
investigation.
is
that
improper?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

so
your

on

on
roberts.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
carlisle,
the
only
injury
alleged
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
stigma.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
district
court
found,
also
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
no
stigma.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why

why
do
you
give
your
case
away
then?
justice
lewis

well,
why
don't
you
stand
on
that?
justice
