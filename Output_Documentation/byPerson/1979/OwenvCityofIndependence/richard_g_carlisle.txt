mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
richard
carlisle
and
i'm
associate
city
councilor
for
the
city
of
independence,
missouri,
which
is
a
respondent
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
clarify
that
the
eighth
circuit
did
indeed
adopt
verbatim
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
and
repeated
them
verbatim
in
its
brief,
and
that
included
all
of
the
findings
as
to
whether
or
not
the
city
manager
based
his
discharge
of
owen
upon
the
stigmatizing
statements
of
paul
roberts
saying
clearly,
he
did
not,
and
that
is
not
an
issue
this
afternoon.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
first
and
second.
there
was
never
any
--
any
issue
that
was
made
as
to
the
fact
that
the
city
manager
had
decided
to
discharge
the
police
chief
at
some
time
prior
to
april
17,
which
was
when
paul
roberts
made
his
statements.
indeed,
i
may
be
wrong
about
the
date
but
it
was
along
about
april
10th
or
april
13th,
somewhere
near
that
he
had
already
chosen
the
chief's
replacement.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
and
also
on
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
found
that,
at
several
points,
that
--
or
owen's
discharge
was
not
for
reasons
that
related
to
his
honesty
and
integrity.
that
is
a
direct
quote
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
and
also,
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
in
express
finding
that
owen,
the
police
chief,
would
have
been
denied
his
position
as
police
chief,
even
had
a
name
clear
in
here
than
held
simply
because
the
reasons
for
discharge
did
not
relate
to
or
adopt
or
discharge
was
not
based
upon
the
paul
roberts
statement.
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
clarify
a
few
more
matters.
this
--
this
isn't,
i
think,
a
difficult
case,
and
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
distinctions
between
policy
and
conduct.
it
is
very
important
to
realize,
i
think,
in
the
context
of
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
in
conduct
alone,
yes.
i
--
i
do
see
the
possibility
of
a
case
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
no,
sir
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
not
really.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
right.
i
can
see,
for
example,
policy
which
is
implemented
merely
once,
first
time
you
have
execution.
let's
say
this
is
the
only
department
head
that
was
ever
discharged
by
the
city
of
independence.
that's
not
true
in
our
city,
but
let's
assume
that
for
purposes
of
argument.
the
city
charter,
which
is
clearly
policy,
states
that
department
heads
are
non-tenured
and
can
be
dismissed
only
by
the
city
manager
and
really,
in
the
city
manager's
unfettered
discretion.
so,
merely,
again
for
purposes
of
argument,
if
this
was
the
only
department
head
that
had
ever
been
discharged,
we
would
still
be
looking
to
the
charter
itself
as
policy.
and
i'd
like
to
also
clarify
right
away
that
counsel,
several
times,
stated
that
the
denial
of
a
name-clearing
hearing
was
based
on
ordinance.
that
is
totally
unwarranted
to
say
that.
the
city
charter
itself,
which,
of
course,
is
not
an
ordinance,
contains
explicit
provisions
about
denial
of
an
appeal
to
the
department
head
where
there
is
a
discharge.
actually,
it's
--
it's
almost
silent
about
that,
but
it
--
the
appeal
rights
that
are
contained
in
the
charter,
section
3.2
(8)
of
the
charter
which
is
set
forth
in
my
statutory
provisions
involved,
relates
to
members
of
the
classified
service.
department
heads
are
members
of
the
unclassified
service.
opposing
counsel
has
tried
to
leverage,
i
suppose,
this
provision,
3.2
(8),
as
into
some
sort
of
not
silent
but
actually
--
control
actually
exercised
charter
provision
that
denied
a
name-clearing
hearing.
that's
simply
not
the
case.
the
--
the
charter
is
really,
i
suppose,
silent
on
name-clearing
hearings.
2.1
(1)
of
the
charter
has
been
cited
by
counsel
belatedly,
i
might
add,
as
to
some
sort
of
policy
which
would
deny
a
name-clearing
hearing.
but
that
--
that
section
is
simply
the
section
that's
contained
in
all
council
manager
charters
which
prohibits
exactly
the
type
of
thing
that
paul
roberts
did
in
this
case,
that
is,
interfering
in
the
discharge
process
in
the
event
that
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court
that
he
did
that.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
mr.
owen
was
the
chief
of
police.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
no,
sir.
he
was
directly
answerable
to
the
city
manager.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
they
had
an
extremely
or
should
have
had
an
extremely
close
working
relationship,
and
i
think
that
is
the
explanation
for
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
the
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
in
the
sense
it
was
defined,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
he
suggest
in
a
point
on
the
property
issue
which
is
not
before
this
court.
it
was
an
issue
below.
and,
in
essence,
in
the
sense
that
for
cause
has
been
used
in
the
supreme
court's
cases,
it
was
not
a
discharge
for
cause.
it
was
a
discharge
totally
in
the
discretion
of
the
city
manager
for
any
cause
the
city
manager
deemed
sufficient.
but
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
well,
there
would
be
no
point
or
purpose
whatsoever
to
an
appeal
of
the
city
manager's
decision.
it's
not
provided
for
in
the
charter.
the
city
manager's
decisions
for
discharge
did
not
relate
or
were
not
based
upon
the
paul
roberts
statement.
any
--
any
name-clearing
hearing
that
may
have
been
implied
by
board
of
regents
versus
roth
or
at
one
time,
though
not
presently,
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
never
by
the
district
court.
in
other
words,
the
right
to
a
name-clearing
hearing
is
obviously
why
we're
here
today.
but
the
--
the
right
to
a
name-clearing
hearing
in
the
event
that
there
was
stigma
in
connection
with
discharge
would,
i
think,
be
something
that
i
could
conceptualize
as
some
meaning
to.
the
point
is
that
it
is
not
in
connection
with
the
discharge,
that
the
name-clearing
hearing
was
not
really
denied
as
such
but
there
was
an
act
of
omission,
let
us
say,
in
a
failure
to
affirmatively
offer
the
police
chief
a
name-clearing
hearing.
the
charter
was
silent
as
to
name-clearing
hearings.
2.1
(1)
of
the
charter
which
no
allegation,
incidentally,
is
in
plaintiff's
complaint
about
2.1
(1)
merely
would
have
prohibited
the
city
council
or
paul
roberts
from
participating
in
the
discharge
process
or
something
in
connection
with
the
discharge
process
and
holding
some
type
of
hearing.
had
the
city
council
not
been
involved
in
the
discharge
process,
perhaps
some
other
type
of
name-clearing
hearing
could
have
been
held
by
the
city
council.
and
3.2
(8)
again
of
the
charter
was
a
section
which
pertained
to
property
rights
and
not
liberty
rights.
the
point
i'd
like
to
make
this
morning
is
that
the
charter
was
silent
as
to
name-clearing
hearings
and
that,
indeed,
no
ordinance,
no
charter
provision,
nothing
pertained
to
the
precise
type
of
name-clearing
hearing
that
we're
talking
here
--
about
here
today.
and
that's
not
unusual
because
procedural
due
process
is
a
broad
and
changing
concept.
it's
--
it's
one
that
--
that
many
times,
we
are
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i'd
--
i
reserve
in
my
last
section,
disagreement
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
see
your
point,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
the
--
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i'm
actually
arguing
both.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
conduct
which
coincided
in
time
of
paul
roberts,
the
city
council
motion,
and
that
lyle
alberg
discharged
the
police
chief.
that
that
conduct,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
"could
fairly
be
said
to
be
official
policy".
i
do
not
agree
with
that
statement,
but
it
is
not
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
--
i
have
not
made
that
really
an
issue
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
then,
i
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
think
you
still
have
to
decide
whether
or
not,
on
that
basis,
what
type
of
cause
of
action
we're
dealing
with
here.
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
the
opposing
counsel
in
this
case
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
no,
your
honor.
in
the
true
policy
case,
say,
for
example,
one
of
plaintiff's
allegations
in
his
complaint,
sir,
was
that,
i
believe,
it
was
3.3
of
our
charter
was
overbroad
on
its
face.
it
was
vague.
good
faith
is
no
defense
to
this
court's
analysis
of
whether
a
charter
provision
is
overbroad
on
its
face,
but
where
you
are
talking
about
conduct,
the
paul
roberts
statement,
the
city
manager's
act
of
omission
in
failing
to
affirmatively
offer
a
name-clearing
hearing
or
--
or
policy,
in
the
sense
that
i
use
the
word
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
the
city
council
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
the
--
the
city
council,
school
boards,
any
type
of
public
governmental
body
can
act
in
a
--
in
a
legislative
capacity.
they
can
also
act
in
a
quasi-judicial
capacity.
they
can
have
conduct.
and
to
illustrate
the
point
we
were
talking
about
an
ordinance
that
prohibited
blacks
in
the
city
at
night.
good
faith
is
no
defense
to
an
analysis
of
that
ordinance.
if,
however,
paul
roberts
personally
felt
that
blacks
should
not
be
in
the
city
at
night,
then
obviously
you're
talking
about
conduct
and
not
policy.
i
would
think
bad
faith
conduct
but
not
policy.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
that's
another
difficult
point.
so
holds
monell,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
but
as
a
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
practical
matter,
the
reasons
behind
the
good
faith
defense,
as
cited
in
--
the
two
reasons
are
cited
in
scheuer
versus
rhodes,
have
always
recognized
the
fact
that
cities
indemnify
their
employees.
and
as
jaffe,
who
is
the
author
of
those
two
rationales,
recognized
it
is
basically
the
--
and
i
think
as
the
court
did
in
--
in
scheuer,
it
is
basically
the
same
concepts
behind
sovereign
immunity
that
are
the
concepts
behind
the
two
rationales
in
--
in
scheuer.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
think
the
respondeat
superior
rule
should
apply
in
full
force
when
an
employee
acting
in
bad
faith
and
as
in
this
case
with
paul
roberts,
in
violation
of
official
policy.
again,
2.1
(1)
prohibited
the
type
of
statement
that
roberts
made.
i
can't
see
that
the
city
should
ever
be
liable
for
that
conduct.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
no,
the
court
of
appeals
quite
simply,
and
without
much
analysis,
held
that
that
conduct
could
fairly
be
said
to
be
official
policy.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
as
--
as
far
as
the
paul
roberts
statement
was
concerned.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
no.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
no,
i'm
saying
that
it's
either
one
case
or
the
other,
your
honor,
that
treat
it
as
conduct
or
treat
it
as
policy,
don't
find
some
critical
gap
in
between
the
two
where
i
have
no
policy
which
has
given
deference,
which
i
think
this
court
would
give
under
the
separation
of
parish
doctrine,
and
i
have
no
conduct
which
is
given
a
good
faith
defense.
quite
literally,
under
plaintiff's
theories,
i
do
not
know
of
any
defense,
any
argument
that
i
could
make
to
this
court.
i
couldn't
argue
good
faith
immunity
and
i
couldn't
argue
deference.
he
has
it
both
ways.
in
other
words,
when
we're
talking
about
policy,
he
says
that
i
have
no
deference.
and
when
we're
talking
about
conduct,
he
says
“i
have
no
qualified
immunity.”
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
what
do
i
have?
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
would
definitely
say
that's
policy.
i
would
say
that
this
court
will
be
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
my
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
then
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--the
--
the
charter
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
would
not.
i
would
say
you
would
be
looking
at
the
charter.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
and
i
would
ask
you
to
give
deference
to
my
charter.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
--
i
agree
that
there
is
no
qualified
immunity
to
true
policy.
i
agree,
in
my
brief,
and
--
and
i
--
i
say
that
where
conduct
is
treated
as
policy,
if
you
are
truly
talking
about
conduct,
as
i
think
we
are
here.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
no,
because
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case,
they
said,
under
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case,
that
qualified
immunity
could
be
granted.
and,
i
think
that
is
--
is
right.
i
will
agree
with
counsel
that
there
was
not
an
extensive
amount
of
discussion,
though,
if
--
if
you
look
at
the
file
of
this
case,
you
will
realize
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
the
case
had
been
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
many
words
had
been
written
about
this
case,
and
the
district
court
had
analyzed
the
issue
of
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
was
tempted
to
make
that
argument,
your
honor,
and
basically
because
of
the
indemnity
provisions
in
some
state
laws
and
the
informal
indemnity
that
is
given
as
a
matter
of
course
at
any
rate,
it
would
be
simplistic
for
me
to
argue
that
the
city
will
never
be
liable
for
the
conduct
of
its
employees.
in
a
--
in
a
true
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
agree
completely.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
agree.
i'm
trying
to
be
practical
in
recognizing
the
fact
that
there
are
going
to
be
instances
coming
before
this
court
and
certainly
coming
before
the
circuits
where
a
city
is
asked
to
be
liable
for
conduct.
and
i
think
this
is
such
a
case,
where
you
make
the
distinction,
and
it's
a
difficult
distinction,
between
conduct
and
policy.
i
have
defined
policy,
for
example,
as
something
of
continuing
effect,
something
of
future
effect
and
general
application.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
accept
it
because
it's
not
a
question
presented
in
this
case.
and
then
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
once
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
well
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
in
my
last
point
relied
on,
i,
in
essence,
raise
certainly
elements
of
that
argument.
but
what
i'm
saying
in
this
case
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
but
i
don't
see
--
what
we
have
here,
really,
i
think,
is
respondeat
superior,
as
--
as
was
recognized
in
the
discussion
before,
and
i'm
willing
to
accept
that
as
favorable
to
my
case,
but
i'm
saying
it's
not
dispositive
of
my
case.
i'm
saying,
as
a
practical
matter,
there
are
going
to
be
situations
where
there
are
close
questions
as
to
whether
something
is
conduct
or
policy.
and
if
it
is
policy,
i
think
this
court
has
to
give
deference
to
that
policy.
if
it's
conduct,
then
i
think
we
get
qualified
immunity.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
we
get
one
or
the
other.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
a
--
a
policy
i
--
i
know
for
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
a
fact.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
if,
in
the
example,
i
believe,
that
you
gave,
your
honor,
that
there
was
a
charter
provision
saying
no
hearings
whatsoever,
we
would
be
here.
we
would
be
reviewing
that
charter
provision.
we
would
be
talking
about
such
things
as
legislative
intent.
we
would
be
talking
about
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
we
would
be
talking
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
about
whether
there
was
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
any
rational
basis.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
believe
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
do
believe
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
do
believe
that
it
is
possible
for
a
city
manager
to
create
city
policy,
although
i
must
agree
that
in
a
council-manager
form
of
government,
historically,
the
city
council
creates
policy
and
the
city
manager
executes
it.
but
i
think
that
--
that
policy
of
a
--
of
general
applicability
in
future
effect
can
be
made
by
an
executive,
and
i
think
that
it
is
possible
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
that
we
could,
in
essence,
have
an
administrative
rule
that
we
would
be
talking
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
about.
we
do
not.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
it's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
again,
i'm
comfortable
with
that
argument
based
upon
my
facts.
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
in
footnote
23
of
my
brief,
there
are
considerations
similar,
though
not
co-terminus
with
qualified
good
faith
immunity
of
the
individual
which
do
pertain
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
retroactive
monetary
relief
in
a
policy
case.
this
court
is,
quite
often,
struggling
with
that
idea,
whether
a
policy
is
voidable
or
void
ab
initio,
whether
some
sort
of
presumption
of
validity
of
policy
such
we
--
such
as
we
should
have
on
our
charter
would
continue
that
policy
in
effect
until
it's
ultimately
deemed
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
in
large,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
actual
good
faith
in
this
case,
of
course,
was
not
limited
solely
to
the
nonexistence
of
settled
law
and,
indeed,
the
existence
of
good
faith
is
not
a
question
presented
on
appeal
but
in
that
regard,
we
also
were
talking
about
no
malice
which
was
established
below.
we're
talking
about
job
offers
that
were
made.
we
were
talking
about
informal
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
believe
it
has
much
to
do
with
--
with
the
qualified
good
faith
immunity
which
would
--
would
defeat
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
that
would
be
mitigation
as
well,
but
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
the
type
of
subjective
factor
that
i
think
the
court
took
into
consideration
when
talking
about
no
malice.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes.
this
is
an
extremely
complex
case
to
analyze,
in
my
opinion,
because
of
the
interplay
of
all
of
those
and
other
issues
in
--
in
here
in
this
case.
it's
--
it's
a
lot
--
lot
easier,
i
think,
to
maybe
look
at
some
other
allegations
in
plaintiff's
complaint
that
aren't
here
to
kind
of
define
what
i
mean
about
when
qualified
immunity
is
not
available.
he
made
allegations,
for
example,
as
to
--
as
i
mention,
one
section
of
our
charter
being
overbroad.
i
think
this
court
can
look
at
the
language.
i
think
it
can
look
at
arguments
of
council,
but
things
like
whether
i
--
whether
the
council
maliciously
passed
that
is
not
going
to
stop
this
court
from
reviewing
some
language
of
my
charter
by
the
same
token
if
the
city
council
conspired
to
fraudulently
pass
a
policy.
you
would
be
talking
about
conduct,
wouldn't
you?
in
--
in
the
making
of
that
policy,
you
can
have
fraud.
there
are
many,
many
cases
involving
fraud
by
policy-making
bodies,
but
that's
conduct.
that's
a
tort.
but
then,
really,
something
comes
into
existence
that
is
called
policy.
there
is
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
such
a
thing
as
policy
exempt.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
think
you
could
have
fraudulent
conspiracy
to
deprive
someone
of
a
constitutional
right
and
that
conspiracy
could
be
either
in
the
making
of
policy
or
in
the
execution
of
policy.
but
then,
when
the
policy
itself
would
come
into
existence,
there
is
really
something
there
to
review.
for
example,
section
3.3
of
our
charter.
it
has
language.
it
exists.
you
can
sit
down.
you
can
look
at
it.
you
can
talk
about
legislative
intent.
you
can
talk
about
rational
basis.
this
court
does
it
all
the
time
and
it
has
done
it
all
the
time
in
1983
cases.
monell
is
basically
such
a
case
where
you
are
talking
about
a
leave
of
absence
policy.
that's
something
that
you
can
review
as
policy.
craig
versus
boren
was
a
1983
case
where
you
were
talking,
i
believe,
about
age
discrimination
and
when
you
could
buy
a
beer.
case
after
case
after
case,
you're
looking
at
a
regulation,
and
this
court
is
not
going
to
concern
itself
with
the
objective
and
subjective
parts
of
qualified
good
faith
immunity
when
you're
reviewing
policy
itself.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
if
we
do
accept,
as
i
have
only
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
that
in
some
event,
conduct
can
bind
the
city,
and
i
think
basically
it
can.
in
other
context,
getting
away
from
this
case
because
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
when
pressed
to
admit
that,
and
although
it's
not
salient
to
my
theory
as
a
whole,
but
i
think
that
you
can
have
situations
possibly
which
may
create
a
1983
case
for
violation
of
federal
laws
where
employee
conduct,
notwithstanding
the
non-application
of
the
respondeat
superior
theory,
could
conceivably
create
entity
liability.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
am,
your
honor,
because
i
see
absolutely
no
policy
that
i
can
rely
on
one
way
or
the
other.
our
charter
is
silent
as
to
policy.
we
are
looking
only
at
conduct,
conduct
which
merely
because
of
the
rank
of
paul
roberts
was
treated
as
policy.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
simply
because
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action.
i
agree
with
opposing
counsel
that
the
qualified
good
faith
immunity
may
be
an
ill
chosen
term
because
i
think
it
relates
to
the
cause
of
action.
if
you
are
talking
about
a
federal
tort,
as
opposing
counsel
designates
this
case
to
be,
then
you
are
looking
at
a
background
of
tort
liability
that
includes
concepts
such
as
state
of
mind,
proximate
cause,
cause
and
fact
and
duty.
i
believe
that
the
good
faith
immunity,
if
we
can
call
it
an
immunity,
which
is,
really,
i
think
the
defense
on
the
merits,
relates
directly
back
to
plaintiff's
prima
facie
case
on
this
federal
tort.
and
whether
the
--
i
--
merely
because
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
the
entity
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
not
at
all,
your
honor.
whether
or
not
something
is
an
affirmative
defense
is,
as
i
understand
civil
procedure,
made
on
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
it
would
be
a
permitted
but
disfavored
defense,
which
this
may
well
be,
the
convenience
to
the
party's
accessibility
to
evidence.
quite
often,
we
have
a
defense
on
the
merits
that
is
made
an
affirmative
defense.
and
incidentally,
i
do
not
know
of
this
court
ever
having
held,
and
i
think
wood
versus
strickland
can
be
held
to
the
contrary
or
seen
to
the
contrary
that
the
good
faith
defense,
as
we
know
it,
is,
indeed,
a
--
an
affirmative
defense.
it's
just
kind
of
accepted
as
such,
but
i
do
not
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
know
that
to
be
the
case.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
your
honor,
he
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
again,
it's
not
the
question
presented
on
appeal.
i
do
reserve
parts
of
that,
your
honor,
in
my
last
point
relied
on
when
i
talk
about
the
threshold
question
being
a
deprivation.
i
do
not
believe
a
deprivation
of
liberty
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
well,
it
was
back
[laughs]
a
little
bit
further
on
my
argument.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
it
is
in
my
last
point
relied
on,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
do
not
concede
that
stigma
is
present
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
a
deprivation
of
liberty,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
there
must
be
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
in
my
last
point
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
and
my
last
point
relied
on,
your
honor,
i
claim
that
there
was
no
deprivation
of
liberty.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
if
it
occurred
today,
your
honor
--
i
--
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
there
are
two
different
ways
of
looking
at
it.
i
feel
that
your
question,
in
the
abstract,
as
to
the
availability
of
a
qualified
immunity
defense
which
i
believe
is
lost
if
you're
acting
in
the
face
of
settled
law.
that
was
the
answer
i
had
intended
to
give.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
there
would
be
none,
under
my
last
point
relied
on.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
do
not
believe
that
plaintiff
has
established
threshold
question
of
deprivation
of
liberty.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
they
--
they
were
not
stigmatizing
in
connection
with
the
discharge,
your
honor,
which
you
must
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
primarily,
they
were
not
in
connection
with
the
discharge,
although
i
think
the
district
court
was
correct
in
--
in
finding,
and
he
was
the
trier
of
fact,
that
the
plaintiff's
name
was
cleared
by
the
return
of
a
no
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
--
true
bill
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
yes,
you
do.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
have
--
i
have
--
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
have
conceded,
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
all
along
that
the
robust
comments
of
paul
roberts
were
stigmatizing.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
carlisle
i
do,
your
honor.
