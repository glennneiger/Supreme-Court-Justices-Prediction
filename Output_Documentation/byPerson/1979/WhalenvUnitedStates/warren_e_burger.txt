mr.
wasserstrom,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
put
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
there
is
only
one
victim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
one
victim,
and
therefore
for
only
one
crime.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
a
man
and
his
wife
were
taking
a
walk,
or
a
young
man
and
his
girl
friend,
and
the
attacker
rapes
the
woman
and
then
murders
the
man
in
the
process
of
his
trying
to
come
to
her
defense
and
her
aid.
double
jeopardy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
felony
murder
and
he
committed
a
homicide
in
the
course
of
carrying
out
a
felony
--
committing
a
felony.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
what
case
would
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
he
went
on
to
murder
the
woman
too,
then,
chose
to
eliminate
the
only
surviving
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
still
double
jeopardy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
assuming
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
hypothesis
is
that
both
are
felony
homicides
and
therefore
under
the
statute,
felony
murders?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
certainly
that
doctrine
if
it
were
followed
by
this
court
would
put
a
premium
on
eliminating
the
witness.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suppose
congress
had
in
mind
the
thought
that
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
the
crime
of
rape
occur
but
they
didn't
want
to
do
anything
to
encourage
homicide,
the
killing
of
the
victim,
and
that
therefore
two
penalties
were
provided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
have
been
the
penalty
if
there
had
been
just
a
murder,
just
the
homicide
and
nothing
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
he
were
to
get
a
new
trial
he
could
not
be
tried
for
anything
higher
than
felony
murder.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
being
charged
in
a
second
degree
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
spell
that
out
of
the
legislative
history,
do
you,
of
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
very
welcome.
mr.
frey,
if
you
do
not
want
to
provide
your
argument
between
now
and
tomorrow,
we
will
rise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you
may
open
tomorrow.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
10:00
o'clock
tomorrow
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
the
arguments
in
whalen
v.
the
united
states
and
at
this
point
mr.
frey,
i
want
to
inform
you
and
mr.
wasserstrom
that
we
will
enlarge
your
time
two
minutes
and
since
with
our
aid
by
questions
mr.
wasserstrom
used
all
his
time,
we
will
allow
you
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
in
your
opening
that
you
suggested
that
this
statute
and
its
history
shows
that
congress
clearly
intended
to
give
punishments
for
each
of
the
offenses.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
felonies
were
involved
in
here,
in
this
case
that
are
within
the
six
felonies
that
make
a
felony
murder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
a
burglary
involved
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
his
original
conviction
was
for
burglary,
rape
and
felony
murder;
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wasserstrom.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
whalen
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
