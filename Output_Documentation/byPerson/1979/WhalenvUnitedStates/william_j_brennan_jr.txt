brennan,

under
the
blockburger
test
there
didn't
have
to
be
successive
prosecutions
for
these
two
offenses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
there
could
be
successive
prosecutions
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
be
whichever
prosecution
came
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
the
opinion,
that
they
couldn't
get
it
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
brown
v.
ohio
a
double
jeopardy
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
isn't
that
quite
similar
to
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
were
two
trials.
but
if
one
begins
with
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
lange,
i
understand
the
dichotomy
that
you
assert
in
your
brief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
never
had
more
than
two
others
agree
with
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
not
urging
it
either,
i
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
case,
harris
or
any
other
case
has
suggested
the
blockburger
test
is
the
test
you
use
in
connection
with
punishments
--
double
punishment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
it
hasn't
suggested
that.
the
cases
that
involved
blockburger
involved
two
proceedings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
supposing
congress
didn't
write
the
statute
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
they
could
say
if
you
rape
somebody,
you
get
ten
years;
if
they
get
killed
while
you
are
raping
them,
they
get
get
20
years.
they
didn't
say
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
statutory
language
in
924(c)
which
says
shall
in
addition
to
the
punishment
provided
for
the
other
offense
should
get
another
two
years.
the
felony
murder
statute
does
not
say
that
in
addition
to
the
punishment
for
rape
there
should
be
an
addition
of
ten
years.
it
simply
doesn't
read
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
provides
a
separate
punishment
scheme
of
its
own.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
no
statute
that
says
that
when
rape
is
committed
in
connection
with
a
felony
murder,
you
can
get
both
the
sentence
for
rape
and
the
sentence
for
felony
murder.
there
is
no
statute
that
says
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actually
we
held
that
because
of
the
constitutional
issue,
we
construed
the
statute
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
that
leads
you
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
does.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
a
second
sentencing
proceeding.
