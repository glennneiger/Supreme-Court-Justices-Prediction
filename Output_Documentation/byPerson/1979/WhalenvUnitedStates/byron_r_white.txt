justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
can't
try
him
for
double
jeopardy
--
you
can't
try
him
over
in
some
other
lawsuit
--
the
chief
justice
suggests
--
what
if
it
is
tried
as
felony
murder
and
the
only
proof
it
is
of
intent
is
another
felony,
is
it
the
underlying
felony.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
theory
does
say
that
even
if
there
are
two
victims
it
would
be
double
jeopardy?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
could
i
ask
you,
was
the
issue
below
that
double
jeopardy
--
i
have
a
difficult
time
finding
any
discussion
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision
in
the
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
not
a
mention
of
double
jeopardy
in
the
opinion,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
is
a
separate
doctrine.
that
is
a
sort
of
semi-judicial
legislative
doctrine.
but
there
is
not
a
mention
of
it.
did
you
present
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
will
give
you
a
clue.
i
am;
and
you
did
present
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wasn't
even
discussed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
perhaps
we
should
remand
it
for
reconsideration,
in
the
light
of
some
cases
that
we
don't
see
mentioned.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
simply
don't
follow
you.
perhaps
i
am
wrong
and
you
are
right
on
the
analytical
aspect
of
the
thing
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
you
know,
you
can
conceive
of
a
system
of
justice
which
regarded
penetration
of
a
woman
in
a
rape
case
as
being
a
more
serious
offense
than
the
taking
of
life.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
can't
just
re-sentence
for
a
felony
murder
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
just
says
you
can
punish
as
many
times
you
want
to
the
same
act,
if
you
just
have
one
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
also
been
argued
there
is
no
violation
of
the
blockburger
rule.
we
have
got
a
lot
of
arguments
but
one
of
them
is
that
there
is
no
violation
of
blockburger.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
iannelli
fits
that
analysis?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
his
sentences.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
he
preserved
it.
the
court
of
appeals
never
addressed
it,
really.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
frey,
why
don't
you
suggest
that
lange
is
just
another
brand
of
two
trials.
lange
involved
two
sentencing
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
isn't
any
case
that
i
know
of
that
speaks
about
double
punishment
that
didn't
involve
two
different
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
involve
the
punishment.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
barred
part
of
it
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
had
to
give
a
credit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
reason
was
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
ex
parte
lange
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
you
are
not
arguing
against
using
the
blockburger
test
as
to
when
there
can
be
separate
trials.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
are
making
it
much
more
difficult
to
win
your
case
to
suggest,
as
you
do,
that
you
could
convict
of
rape
in
a
separate
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you
--
convict
of
rape
in
a
separate
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
said
that
this
--
that
the
blockburger
test
is
not
violated
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
did
you
just
misstate
yourself
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
other
test
is
there?
would
the
blockburger
test
--
would
it
or
would
it
not
bar
a
separate
trial
for
rape?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
need
to
win
on
that
to
win
your
case
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
construction
you
say
doesn't
violate
any
constitutional
right.
