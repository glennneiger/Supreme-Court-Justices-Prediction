justice
potter
stewart
brown
v.
ohio
was
a
double
jeopardy
case,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
this
court
hold
almost
precisely
that
in
harris
v.
oklahoma?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
government's
argument
is
that
the
test
should
be
quite
different.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it
squarely
held
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
permitted
dual
punishment
for
one
offense,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
prohibit
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
a
single
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
have
to
hold
that,
but
it
did
hold
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
court
applied
that
doctrine
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
was
also
a
case
involving
a
subsidiary
issue
in
that
case,
wasn't
it.
it
involved
precisely
the
ex
parte
lange
doctrine,
as
i
remember.
i
haven't
re-read
it,
and
i
didn't
write
it.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce
it
was
not
a
federal
case
but
a
state
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
holding
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
absolutely
requires
that
punishment
already
exacted
must
be
fully
credited
in
imposing
sentence
upon
a
new
conviction
for
the
same
offense,
in
that
case
the
court
directly
applied
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
lange,
as
a
double
jeopardy
doctrine.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
just
casual
verbiage.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
it
under
the
compulsion
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
done
in
north
carolina
and
this
court
held
that
it
had
to
be
done
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
double
jeopardy.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
done
as
a
matter
of
course
in
that
state.
and
this
court
said
that
the
constitution,
i.e.
and
specifically
the
double
jeopardy
clause
required
that
north
carolina
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
your
first
argument
is
that
we
should
accept
the
construction
of
the
statute
put
upon
it
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
we
would
the
construction
put
on
a
state
statute
by
a
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
after
a
jury
trial,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
in
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
of
rape,
and
of
killing
the
same
victim
in
the
perpetration
of
rape.
he
was
sentenced
to
consecutive
terms
of
imprisonment
of
20
years
to
life
for
first-degree
murder,
and
of
15
years
to
life
for
rape.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
convictions
and
the
sentences.
we
brought
the
case
here
to
consider
the
contention
that
the
imposition
of
cumulative
punishments
for
the
two
offenses
was
contrary
to
federal
statutory
and
constitutional
law.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
the
court's
written
opinion,
we
have
concluded
that
cumulative
sentences
cannot
lawfully
be
imposed
for
the
two
offenses
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgement.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
