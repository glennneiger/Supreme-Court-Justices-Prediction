justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
strange?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
seem
so
to
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
strange
about
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
the
legislative
judgment
that
--
necessary
only
if
a
felony
were
so
dangerous
to
society,
that
if
life
is
taken
in
the
course
of
commission
of
a
felony,
you
should
be
treated
just
as
if
you
had
the
intent
to
murder.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
that
just
stands
blockburger
on
its
head,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
blockburger
wasn't
originally
a
constitutional
test,
it
was
a
test
for
determining
legislative
intent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
say
anything
about
double
jeopardy,
does
it,
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
quote
you
just
made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
quote
you
just
made
said
nothing
about
double
jeopardy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
further
consecutive
sentences.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
brown,
blockburger.
i
take
it
what
you
mean
is
brown,
since
blockburger
wasn't
a
constitutional
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
legislative
intent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
brown.
although
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
brown
was
a
state
case
where
presumably
the
state
courts
of
ohio
were
perfectly
competent
to
determine
what
the
intent
of
the
ohio
legislature
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
didn't
turn
on
legislative
intent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
you?
i
would
think
your
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
position
would
be
clear
as
a
bell
on
that,
that's
double
jeopardy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
where
the
case
has
been
called
to
their
attention.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
talking
now
about
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
this
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
are
not
quarrelling
with
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
the
statute.
you
are
saying
the
court
of
appeals
mis-describes
the
way
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
quarreling
with
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
quarreling
with
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
since
the
court
reorganization
act
of
1970,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
last
word
as
to
what
a
statute
such
as
this
means,
as
if
a
state
court
says
this
is
what
it
means.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
argument
withstands
analysis
in
the
case
of
intentional
rape
that
results
in
death
where
there
is
carnal
violation
of
the
woman
plus
the
death?
aren't
there
two
separate
interests
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
say
in
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
but
i
am
saying
in
an
analytical
sense
you
can
have
your
scale
of
values
however
the
legislature
chooses
to
draw
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
double
jeopardy
analysis
that
you
think
the
court
has
adopted
based
on
the
actual
facts
necessary
for
a
conviction
in
each
particular
crime,
or
in
the
abstract
on
what
facts
might
be
used
to
convict
for
each
particular
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
an
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
if
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
you
analyze
the
facts
of
each
particular
case
to
decide
whether
there
is
double
jeopardy
and
if
one
fact
has
to
be
proved
twice
or
one
offense
contains
a
fact
that
the
other
does,
it
is
double
jeopardy?
or
is
it
an
abstract
thing
that
you
might
have
to
in
a
hypothetical
situation
prove
one
fact
twice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
as
far
as
first
degree
murder
is
concerned,
this
case
involves
felony
murder
and
felony
murder
only.
am
i
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
brown
had
said
"we
have
heard
your
double
jeopardy
argument,
we
know
we
are
bound
by
the
united
states
constitution
amendment,
we
find
them
unconvincing,
and
we
find
the
legislative
intent
to
be
against
you,
do
you
think
this
court
would
have
had
any
power
to
reverse
other
than
on
a
constitutional
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
we
are
to
avoid
a
constitutional
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
to
get
back
perhaps
to
as
you
say
fundamentals,
my
understanding
of
the
reading
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
that
nor
shall
any
person
be
subject
for
the
same
offense
to
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb.
was
the
petitioner
here
tried
separately
twice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
ex
parte
lange
a
case
from
a
state
court
or
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
could
well
be
under
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court,
that
you
just
don't
impose
sentences
in
excess
of
those
authorized
by
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
need
a
constitutional
docket.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
were
two
trials
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
felony
is
not
necessarily
rape.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
there
a
companion
case
to
pernell
which
had
been
written
by
justice
stevens
in
the
seventh
circuit
which
it
said
quite
unequivocally
that
even
though
congress
had
denied
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
the
right
to
jury
trial
was
constitutional
and
therefore
notwithstanding
the
right
to
--
the
congressional
intent
would
have
to
fail
when
the
constitutional
provision
was
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
held
he
didn't
by
appealing
waive
any
right
that
he
might
have
as
to
a
larger
sentence.
