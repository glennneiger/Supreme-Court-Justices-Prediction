mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
it
is
all
right
with
the
court,
i
would
be
happy
to
begin
now.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
from
one
standpoint
this
appears
to
be
a
case
that
deals
with
an
arcane
and
esoteric
corner
of
the
law.
it
lends
itself
to
subtle
linguistic
disputes
regarding
the
meaning
of
such
terms
as
"same
offense"
and
"lesser
included
offense"
as
well
as
to
elaborate
efforts
to
plumb
the
depths
of
the
mysterious
blockburger
test.
it
has
produced
from
petitioner
and
intricate
analysis
of
snippets
of
dictum
in
brown
v.
ohio,
in
jeffers,
and
in
simpson.
and
i
can't
deny
that
we
too
have
engaged
in
our
brief
in
a
serious
effort
to
analyze
comprehensively
this
complex
and
interesting
talk.
there
is
however
a
danger
in
all
of
this
the
court
will
lose
sight
of
the
forest
for
the
trees.
so
let
me
draw
back
for
a
minute
to
make
one
point.
it
seems
to
me
both
futile
and
absolutely
devastating
to
petitioner's
contention
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
congress
from
imposing
cumulative
punishments
for
rape
and
felony
murder
because
the
two
offenses
are
the
same.
suppose
congress
had
enacted
a
statute
that
stated
as
follows
-
"anyone
who
kills
another
person
in
the
course
of
committing
a
rape
shall
be
sentenced
to
a
maximum
term
of
life
imprisonment
and
to
a
minimum
term
in
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
court
of
not
less
than
20
nor
more
than
35
years."
now,
it
seems
to
me
beyond
argument,
given
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
define
offenses
and
to
set
punishments
for
them,
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
validity
of
such
a
statute.
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
statute
in
this
case
to
mean.
now,
it
is
true
congress
expressed
its
will
by
means
of
two
separate
statutes,
which
must
be
read
together
to
give
the
result
of
my
hypothetical
statute,
but
surely
the
double
jeopardy
clause
cannot
be
construed
to
require
that
the
legislature
employ
a
particular
form
of
words
or
that
it
do
something
in
one
section
rather
than
two.
such
a
reading
would
trivialize
this
important
constitutional
provision.
this
is
precisely
the
conclusion
that
this
court
reached
in
gore
where
it
said
about,
after
analyzing
the
hypothetical
statute
such
as
i
have
given,
is
it
conceivable
that
such
a
statute
would
not
be
within
the
power
of
congress.
and
is
it
rational
to
find
such
a
statute
constitutional
but
to
strike
that
on
the
blockburger
doctrine
as
violative
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
or
here
to
strike
down
the
two
separate
statutes
as
violative
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
now,
let
me
turn
back
from
the
forest
to
the
trees.
petitioner's
argument
rests
upon
the
notion
that
because
proof
of
felony
murder
requires
the
proof
of
the
underlying
felony,
the
latter
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
felony
murder
and
therefore
is
the
same
offense
and
therefore
may
not
be
made
the
subject
of
multiple
punishments.
he
says
the
blockburger
test
is
a
constitutional
test
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
for
the
permissibility
of
multiple
punishments.
there
are
several
difficulties
with
his
argument.
the
first
difficulty
is
that
rape
and
felony
murder
are
not
in
fact
the
same
offense
under
the
blockburger
test,
which
depends
upon
the
elements
of
the
two
offenses.
obviously,
one
need
not
kill
in
order
to
rape
or
rape
in
order
to
kill.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think
that
the
blockburger
test
is
the
exclusive
criterion
for
successive
prosecutions,
although
i
think
that
if
they
fail
the
blockburger
test
there
could
not
be
successive
prosecutions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
not
under
harris
v.
oklahoma;
but
i
have
no
problem
squaring
that
result
with
the
position
that
we
are
contending
for
here,
because
it
is
a
very
different
matter
as
to
what
punishments
the
legislature
may
prescribe
and
as
to
when
the
courts
and
the
prosecutor
may
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
would
be
true
under
brown,
whichever
prosecution
came
first.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
preliminarily
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
response
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
my
colleague
yesterday,
the
petitioner
did
argue
in
his
opening
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
sentence
violated
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
on
his
sentences,
yes.
so
i
think
he
did
preserve
the
constitutional
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
didn't
address
it
in
constitutional
terms,
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
but
there
is
of
course
language
scattered
about
in
opinions
of
this
court
going
back
as
far
as
ex
parte
lange
which
suggests
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
may
have
some
bearing
on
punishment
as
well
as
on
successive
trials.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
it
permitted
it,
or
prohibited
it?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
ex
parte
lange
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
ex
parte
lange
is
a
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
it
rested
its
holding
that
to
impose
a
sentence
that
the
legislature
had
not
authorized
on
the
defendant
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
say
--
well,
there
are
of
course
blockburger
line
of
statutory
cases
which
did
not
involve
two
separate
proceedings.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
blockburger
involved
punishment
and
not
successive
trials.
i
think
the
point
that
i
am
making
which
--
and
i
agree
with
you
--
but
this
case
involves
a
single
sentencing
proceeding
following
a
single
trial.
it
does
not
involve
multiple
trial
such
as
north
carolina
v.
peace
involved.
nor
does
it
involve
bringing
the
defendant
back
after
he
has
been
once
sentenced
for
re-sentencing.
and
our
contention
here
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
--
imposes
no
restrictions
on
the
sentencing
court.
it
establishes
no
test
that
must
be
satisfied
in
imposing
sentence
in
a
single
sentencing
proceeding
following
a
single
trial.
now,
we
have
said
in
our
brief
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
restricts
the
sentencing
court
to
imposing
a
sentence
that
has
been
authorized
by
the
legislature.
and
we
say
that
because
there
is
language
in
this
court's
opinions,
going
back
to
ex
parte
lange,
that
suggest
that.
but
i
think
that
is
an
essentially
trivial
proposition
which
i
would
not
have
ascribed
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
myself,
but
to
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
but
of
course
was
a
case
involving
two
trials
and
two
sentences.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure
what
you
are
referring
to,
but
the
question
was
whether
the
defendant
once
having
been
sentenced
to
a
particular
sentence
for
a
particular
crime
could
have
in
place
of
that
sentence
following
a
re-trial,
a
higher
sentence
imposed.
and
the
court
indeed
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
didn't
bar
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
barred
not
giving
the
credit
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
for
purposes
of
this
case
it
seems
to
that
those
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
ex
parte
lange
what
happened
was
a
sentence
was
imposed
that
legislature
had
not
authorized;
and
not
only
that,
but
the
judge
when
he
went
to
correct
it
in
ex
parte
lange
and
he
said,
"well,
i
will
eliminate
the
fine
and
i
will
just
leave
you
with
the
jail
sentence,"
the
fine
had
already
been
paid
and
there
was
no
way
for
returning
it.
so
even
though
the
judge
said
he
was
only
sentencing
him
to
prison
in
ex
parte
lange,
in
fact
he
had
to
pay
a
fine
and
go
to
prison.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
it
is.
that
is
my
recollection
the
last
time
i
looked
at
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
it
was
a
federal
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
could
well
be.
i
don't
think
you
need
to
resort
to
the
supervisory
power.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
federal
case
if
a
sentence
is
imposed
that
congress
has
not
authorized,
then
all
you
do
is
apply
the
sentencing
provision
of
the
statute
to
reverse
the
sentence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
in
a
--
if
you
had
a
state
case
in
which
the
defendant
in
which
the
sentence
was
authorized
by
statute
was
five
years
imprisonment
and
the
trial
judge
said,
"well,
this
is
such
a
heinous
version
of
this
crime
that
i
am
going
to
give
you
ten
years
imprisonment,"
i
have
two
comments
about
what
would
happen
when
this
case
got
up
here.
the
first
is
that
nobody
would
really
suggest
that
that
was
a
double
jeopardy
case.
and
the
second
is
that
i
think
everybody
would
agree
--
i
certainly
would
--
that
that
violates
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
due
process
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
have
not
sought
to
maintain
the
position
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
nothing
to
do
with
sentencing.
the
position
i
am
maintaining
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
single
sentencing
proceeding
following
a
single
trial.
now,
there
is
a
petition
before
you
that
we
filed
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
difrancesco
which
involves
the
right
of
the
government
to
appeal
a
sentence.
now,
that
involves
an
issue
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
--
i
can
see
that.
and
i
suppose
if
the
judge
sentenced
somebody
to
three
years
imprisonment
for
an
offense
where
he
could
have
sentenced
him
to
10,
then
after
the
three
years
were
up
he
called
him
back
in
and
said
"i
have
changed
my
mind,
i
think
you
deserve
more,"
that
i
think
would
involve
a
double
jeopardy
question.
but
this
does
not
involve
a
double
jeopardy
question.
i
simply
don't
see
where
it
comes
from.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
didn't
argue
that
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think
that
that
need
trouble
the
court
because
that
kind
of
case
is
always
dealt
with
as
a
matter
of
legislative
intent.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
intent
of
the
legislature
should
be
ignored
by
the
court
and
in
your
hypotheticals,
and
i
think
it
is
certainly
true
in
title
iv
and
title
vii
of
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
constitutional
problem
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
it
may
be
that
if
congress
passed
the
same
statute
a
thousand
times
and
the
defendant
had
to
face
a
thousand
charges
and
a
thousand
sentences
there
might
be
some
problem
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
that
is
absolutely
our
position.
now
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
do
argue
that,
although
of
course
we
have
also
argued
that
that
is
not
a
matter
that
this
court
ought
to
reach.
but
our
constitutional
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
does
not
depend
directly
on
the
fact
that
in
this
case
congress
did
authorize.
our
constitutional
argument
is
that
you
simply
don't
have
a
double
jeopardy
inquiry
in
this
kind
of
case.
all
you
have
is
your
conventional
inquiry
into
legislative
intent
which
can
be
aided
by
the
blockburger
test
or
anything
else.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
definitely
was.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
address
the
point
that
petitioner
raised.
he
said
that
it
would
somehow
inconvenient
or
undesirable
to
have
different
tests
for
successive
prosecutions
and
for
multiple
punishments
following
a
single
prosecution.
now,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
he
means,
because
of
course
we
are
suggesting
that
in
the
punishment
context
there
is
no
test,
you
simply
do
what
you
would
always
do
in
determining
the
propriety
of
a
particular
punishment
under
the
statutes.
the
test
that
is
difficult
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
you
do
it
under
the
compulsion
of
ordinary
rules
of
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
court
held
it
had
to
be
done
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
you
are
talking
about
the
crediting
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that
--
i
can't
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that
was
not
a
single-sentencing
proceeding
following
a
single
trial.
i
mean
x
just
--
i
have
not
attempted
to
deny
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
in
the
situation
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce.
but
my
point
here
is
that
this
is
a
very
different
situation.
we
are
not
talking
about
punishments
being
imposed
twice
on
the
defendant
except
in
a
very
hypothetical
sense,
which
is
derived
from
--
well,
let
us
look
at
brown
v.
ohio
for
a
moment.
because
the
court
said
in
brown,
and
i
think
it
was
clearly
in
passing,
that
the
blockburger
test
is
the
test
for
determining
the
propriety
of
multiple
punishments
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
i
think
you
would
have
to
agree
that
brown
did
not
involve
any
multiple
punishment
issue
except
a
derivative
of
a
successive
prosecution
issue.
and
elsewhere
in
the
same
opinion
the
court
says
that
the
role
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
to
restrict
the
legislature
but
to
make
sure
the
courts
and
prosecutors
don't
exceed
their
legislative
authorization.
now,
we
have
a
case
here
where
if
you
accept
the
statutory
construction
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
it
is
clear
that
the
sentence
imposed
on
this
petitioner
did
not
exceed
the
legislative
authorization.
and
what
petitioner
wants
to
do
is
to
say
even
though
congress
meant
to
allow
this
man
to
receive
this
sentence
for
the
crimes
that
he
committed,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
somehow
and
in
some
mysterious
way
by
virtue
of
the
blockburger
test
and
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
a
lesser
included
offense
is
the
same
offense,
bars
this.
now,
i
cannot
see
that
it
is
appropriate
to
take
a
dictum
--
and
let
me
say
also
that
the
statement
in
brown
about
the
blockburger
test
being
the
test
for
--
constitutional
test
for
multiple
punishments
sprung
full
blown
like
palace
athena
from
nowhere.
there
is
nothing
in
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
ever
suggested
that
the
blockburger
test
was
a
constitutional
test
for
multiple
punishments
in
a
context
such
as
we
have
in
this
case.
indeed,
in
iannalli
which
was
i
think
two
term
before
brown,
the
court
expressly
said
that
the
blockburger
test
is
the
test
for
ascertaining
legislative
intent.
indeed,
it
said
that
about
wharton's
rule
in
a
case
where
the
substantive
offense
necessarily
involved
conspiracy,
the
court
said
that
is
a
test
for
ascertaining
legislative
intent.
now,
i
certainly
submit
to
the
court
that
the
dictum
in
brown
is
at
this
point
subject
to
reexamination
and
ought
not
to
stand
in
the
way
of
adopting
a
rule
that
is
consonant
with
the
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
doesn't
apply
in
an
area
where
it
doesn't
really
fit.
and
what
is
being
done
with
the
blockburger
test
if
petitioner
has
his
way,
is
to
pervert
the
test
from
its
original
purpose
which
was
to
follow
the
legislative
intent
into
a
test
which
is
being
used
to
thwart
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
not
opposed
to
using
that.
we
think
it
is
appropriate
but
i
might
note
that
as
harris
v.
oklahoma
indicates
and,
indeed,
as
in
re
neilson
indicates
you
may
go
beyond
the
blockburger
test.
that
is
a
very
murky
area.
i
think
justice
brennan
has
adopted
a
position
which
is
quite
clear
as
to
that
is
the
same
transaction
test.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand
that,
the
court
has
not
adopted
it.
but
the
court
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
not
urging
it.
but
i
find
far
less
difficulty
as
an
analytical
matter
to
find
that
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
that
i
do
to
find
the
result
the
petitioner
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me.
in
connection
with
punishment?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
correct,
except
--
that
is
correct,
every
case
that
involves
blockburger,
except
there
is
a
reference
i
believe
in
the
opinion
in
simpson
to
the
statement
in
brown.
and
simpson
was
a
single
proceeding.
but,
again,
it
was
dictum.
simpson
was
a
case
which
did
exactly
what
we
think
the
court
ought
to
do,
that
is
it
looked
at
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
now,
let
me
make
just
one
point
in
passing,
and
i
did
want
to
make
myself
clear,
because
when
i
talk
about
whether
the
blockburger
test
is
or
is
not
satisfied
in
this
particular
case
with
these
offenses
i
don't
want
to
be
thought
of
as
endorsing
the
blockburger
test
as
an
appropriate
test
in
the
context
of
a
single
sentencing
following
a
single
trial.
but
if
we
must
have
the
blockburger
test
because
the
court
feels
bound
by
what
was
said
in
brown
v.
ohio
or
independently
concludes
that
it
is
appropriate
in
this
circumstance,
it
shouldn't
be
restricted
to
necessarily
included
offenses.
that
is
robbery,
which
is
a
necessarily
included
offense
of
armed
robbery,
the
kind
of
situation
which
you
cannot
commit
the
greater
offense
without
at
the
same
time
committing
the
lesser.
now,
what
we
have
here
is
what
we
have
called
in
our
brief
"compound
and
predicate
felony"
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
that
is
why
we
have
said
what
we
have
here
is
a
compound
felony
and
a
predicate
felony.
the
compound
felony
consists
of
showing
a
predicate
felony,
which
it
can
be
one
other
class.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
one
or
another,
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
we
have
said
at
one
point
in
one
of
our
papers
in
this
case
that
you
can't
by
sheer
force
of
logic
decide
whether
the
blockburger
test
is
satisfied
or
not
satisfied.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
explain
to
me
why
--
i
mean
our
position
is
very
straightforward.
you
don't
have
to
commit
rape
in
order
to
commit
felony
murder.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
blockburger
test
has
always
looked
at
the
provisions
under
which
sentence
is
being
imposed
and
the
element
set
forth
in
those
provisions
in
the
statute.
and
if
you
look
at
the
rape
statute
you
will
of
course
not
find
a
killing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
know
how
to
resolve
that
conundrum
except
i
want
to
make
one
point
which
is
very
important.
obviously
we
don't
care
very
much
in
practical
terms
about
what
happens
with
felony
murder
and
the
underlying
felony,
because
felony
murder
carries
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
with
a
minimum
of
20
years.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
lot
that
is
at
stake
in
the
particular
context
of
the
felony
murder
statute.
it
is
of
course
important
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
be
understood
in
a
consistent
and
rational
way.
and
it
is
very
important
to
us
as
applied
to
the
firearms
statutes.
that
is
section
924(c).
now,
there
you
have
a
statute
which
is
exactly
parallel
to
the
felony
murder
statute.
you
must
have
a
federal
felony
and
the
use
or
the
unlawful
carrying
of
a
firearm
in
the
course
of
that
felony.
so
whatever
the
federal
felony
is,
highjacking,
bank
robbery
--
although
there
are
some
problems
with
bank
robbery
--
assault,
homicide,
you
must
prove
that
felony
in
order
to
prove
the
violation
of
924(c).
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
burglary
in
this
particular
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
convicted
of
a
burglary
and
he
was
convicted
of
a
purposeful
killing.
and
even
if
the
burglary
were
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
two
counts
of
felony
murder.
and
the
burglary
was
reversed
not
because
of
any
failure
of
evidence
but
because
of
the
court
of
appeals
view
of
ex
parte
ban
in
permissible
amendment
of
the
indictment.
but
as
the
case
now
stands,
he
stands
convicted
only
of
rape
and
of
felony
murder
based
on
the
rape.
that
is
all
we
have
here.
our
position
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
prohibits
if
congress
wants
to
say
15
years
for
the
rape
and
20
years
additional
for
the
felony
murder.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
constitution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
believe
i
have
suggested
that;
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
also
said
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
the
blockburger
test
is
not
violated
here,
but
the
blockburger
test
is
not
the
exclusive
test
for
determining
the
permissibility
of
multiple
prosecutions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
this
case?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
not
be
the
blockburger
test
that
would
bar
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
we
don't
think
these
offenses
pass
the
blockburger
test.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
we
don't.
but
let
me
make
clear
my
position.
a
separate
trial
would
be
barred
under
harris
v.
oklahoma.
that
is
not
because
the
blockburger
test
is
not
satisfied
here.
harris
v.
oklahoma
makes
no
mention
of
the
blockburger
test.
harris
v.
oklahoma
cites
only
successive
prosecution
and
not
multiple
punishment
cases,
and
the
case
it
cites
is
in
re
neilson.
and
in
brown
v.
ohio
there
is
a
footnote
which
points
out
that
in
re
neilson
was
a
case
where
the
two
offenses,
cohabitation
and
adultery,
satisfied
the
blockburger
test.
in
order
to
be
guilty
of
cohabitation
you
did
not
have
to
be
married;
you
simply
had
to
live
with
two
women
at
the
same
time.
in
order
to
be
guilty
of
adultery
you
did
not
have
to
live
with
two
women
at
the
same
time.
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
successive
prosecutions
were
barred
even
though
the
blockburger
test
or
each
equivalent
was
satisfied
by
the
two
statutes.
so
all
that
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
a
murky
area
which
i
take
it
includes
this
area
of
compound
and
predicate
offenses
in
which
successive
prosecutions
would
be
barred.
but
multiple
punishments
present
no
problem.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
suppose
congress
passed
a
statute
and
said
that
for
robbery
the
punishment
would
be
five
years
imprisonment;
and
for
armed
robbery,
the
punishment
would
be
the
punishment
for
robbery
plus
a
period
of
ten
years
imprisonment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
they
are
saying
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
statutes
to
mean.
and
if
the
double
jeopardy
clause
means
that
congress
has
to
put
it
one
statute
and
can't
have
it
in
two,
i
just
cannot
believe
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
addresses
something
as
insignificant
as
how
many
statutes
congress
chooses
to
put
something
in.
and
let
me
make
another
point.
to
go
back
to
justice
stewart's
reference
to
ex
parte
lange
and
the
bar
in
multiple
punishments,
multiple
punishments
for
a
single
crime
are
an
every
day
occurrence
in
the
federal
courts.
the
defendant
can
be
imprisoned,
he
can
be
fined,
he
can
suffer
a
forfeiture,
he
can
be
sentenced
to
a
term
of
special
parole.
now,
a
fine
followed
by
a
term
of
special
parole
for
exactly
the
same
offense
sounds
like
two
punishments
for
one
offense.
but
if
it
is
imposed
following
a
single
trial
and
a
single
sentencing
proceeding,
nobody
i
think
would
suggest
that
there
is
anything
the
least
bit
wrong
with
it.
and
i
simply
cannot
bring
myself
to
believe
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
to
come
back
to
924(c),
means
that
congress
cannot
say
if
you
use
a
firearm
in
the
commission
of
a
federal
felony
you
are
to
receive
a
consecutive
sentence
of
two
years
imprisonment,
or
whatever
it
may
be,
beyond
the
sentence
imposed
for
the
underlying
felony.
that
is
exactly
what
congress
has
done.
and
if
petitioner
is
right,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
that.
i
simply
don't
think
it
reaches
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
it
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
provides
a
punishment
for
murder
and
elsewhere
there
is
a
punishment
for
rape.
and
there
is
a
statute
that
says
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
are
two
statutes
that
say
after
the
d.c.
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
justice
stevens
you
are
only
raising
a
question
that
goes
to
the
intention
of
the
legislature.
you
may
say
that
you
are
not
satisfied
that
the
legislature
has
sufficiently
clearly
expressed
its
intention.
but
the
point
that
i
am
arguing
here
is
may
the
legislature
--
may
it
constitutionally
provide
for
punishment
separate,
punitive
punishment
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
turn
to
that
point.
while
it
is
ordinarily
true
that
the
court
will
not
decide
a
constitutional
question
if
it
can
settle
the
case
on
statutory
grounds,
that
is
exactly
the
situation
that
existed
in
pernell
v.
southall
realty,
exactly.
there
was
a
statute
pernell
v.
southall
realty.
the
statute
provided
under
the
construction
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
for
the
elimination
of
a
jury
trial
in
certain
kinds
of
eviction
actions
or
something.
and
the
issue
came
up
here
as
a
seventh
amendment
issue
and
the
court
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
marshall
recognized
that
it
might
be
able
to
avoid
reaching
the
constitutional
issue
by
construing
the
statute
differently.
but
it
said
in
the
most
unequivocal
terms
that
a
decision
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
construing
a
statute
of
local
application
will
not
be
reviewed
by
this
court
on
statutory
grounds,
even
to
avoid
reaching
a
constitutional
issue.
rather,
that
court
will
be
treated
as
the
highest
court
of
state.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
sure,
although
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
the
constitution
required
a
jury
trial
congress
couldn't
do
away
with
it,
if
that
is
the
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
in
this
case
i
think
it
is
clear
that
you
can't,
and
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
have
time
to
explain
why.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
after
all,
there
are
50
other
states
that
this
case
could
as
easily
have
come
from
and
you
would
have
had
no
choice
to
reconstrue
the
legislative
intent.
so
it
is
hardly
a
very
damaging
precedent.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
the
court
has
to
decide
the
question
or
whether
or
not
it
does.
and
obviously
i
think
it
should
decide
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
here.
thank
you.
