mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
silas
wasserstrom
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
thomas
whalen.
petitioner
was
tried
in
the
district
of
columbia
superior
court
on
a
seven-court
indictment
charging
rape,
robbery,
burglary
and
three
counts
of
felony
murder
predicated
on
these
felonies.
he
was
also
charged
with
one
count
of
second
degree
murder,
that
is
murder
with
malice.
all
of
these
charges
grew
out
of
a
single
incident
and
involved
one
victim.
two
of
these
counts
--
robbery
and
felony
murder
premised
on
it
--
were
dismissed
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
just
want
to
make
clear,
your
honor,
that
the
issue
here
is
one
that
involves
consecutive
sentences
where
where
there
is
a
single
victim.
certainly
if
there
had
been
more
than
one
victim,
our
position
would
be
very
i
am
not
trying
to
argue
the
fact
that
it
was
one
victim
is
dispositive.
it
is
clear
to
the
court
that
it
is
a
case
involving
a
single
victim.
two
more
of
these
counts,
those
charging
burglary
and
felony
murder
burglary,
were
dismissed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
reasons
not
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that
is
not
our
position,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
if
the
murder
in
this
case
is
proven
by
the
government
in
a
way
that
does
not
depend
on
proof
of
the
underlying
felony,
then
we
would
not
claim
that
there
was
any
double
jeopardy
violation
in
punishing
consecutively
for
the
felony
and
for
the
murder.
and
we
said
in
our
brief
that
we
are
not
challenging
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
consecutive
sentences
for
rape
and
the
second
degree
murder
count
here.
our
position
is
not
that
simply
because
there
is
one
victim
there
can
only
be
one
sentence.
our
position
turns
on
the
fact
that
here
to
prove
the
felony
murder
the
government
relied
on
the
underlying
felony.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no,
it
is
not
strange
at
all.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no,
it
isn't
strange
at
all.
what
would
be
strange,
in
our
position,
would
be
to
punish
the
person
consecutively,
however,
for
the
felony
murder
as
well
as
for
the
underlying
felony.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
it
is
strange
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
the
felony
murder
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
most
felony
murder
statutes
do,
is
to
impose
a
rule
of
strict
liability
with
respect
to
murder
occurring
in
the
course
of
a
felony.
the
district
of
columbia
statute,
for
example,
makes
the
penalty
for
such
a
murder
--
first
degree
murder
--
it
makes
the
murder
first
degree
murder
and
it
makes
the
penalty
for
that
murder
20
years
to
life,
mandatory
sentence
20
years
to
life.
and
that
can
be
for
killing
which
is
otherwise
blameless,
the
killing
was
just
unforeseen,
unforeseeable,
unintended.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
congress
might
have
wanted
to
do
that,
but
it
is
obvious
that
congress
didn't
want
to
do
that
here.
that
is
a
separate
argument.
this
is
an
argument
we
made,
that
congress
didn't
intend
consecutive
sentences
in
this
case;
and
we
made
that
argument
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
the
structure
in
felony
murder
statutes.
the
double
jeopardy
argument
is
a
different
one.
it
is
that
to
prove
felony
murder,
a
murder
which
carries
20
years
to
life,
whereas
the
underlying
felony
without
a
killing
would
carry
no
mandatory
sentence
and
would
be
punishable
by
provision
if
the
judge
chose
to
impose
it.
our
argument
of
double
jeopardy
is
that
when
a
felony
murder
can
only
be
proved
by
proof
of
the
underlying
offense,
that
is
the
felony,
then
the
felony
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
felony
murder.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
that's
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
that
is
the
government's
argument,
your
honor.
but
there
is
really
no
question
but
that
this
court
has
since
blockburger
adopted
it
as
the
constitutional
test
for
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
brown
v.
ohio,
for
example,
the
court
said
"the
established
test
for
determining
whether
two
offenses
are
sufficiently
distinguishable
to
permit
the
imposition
of
cumulative
punishment
was
stated
in
blockburger."
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
what
else
would
preclude
it?
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
it
was
a
double
jeopardy
case;
yes.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
double
jeopardy
was
the
only
constitutional
provision
that
could
conceivably
forbid
consecutive
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
moreover,
in
brown
this
court
was
clear
in
stating
that.
"when
the
greater
offense"
--
when
two
offenses
are
related
to
a
greater
and
lesser
included
offense
they
are
"the
same
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy."
here
we
submit
the
rape
underlying
the
petitioner's
conviction
for
first
degree
felony
murder
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
murder
for
the
simple
and
compelling
reason
that
to
prove
its
case
of
first
degree
felony
murder,
the
government
necessarily
had
to
prove
the
underlying
rape.
this
being
so,
brown,
blockburger
teach
that
the
rape
and
the
felony
predicated
on
it
are
the
same
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
and
thus,
the
consecutive
sentences
imposed
here
were
unconstitutional.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no,
block
--
our
position,
your
honor,
is
this
-
that
blockburger
establishes
a
test.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
it
establishes
a
test
which
was
originally
formulated
as
a
test
for
determining
legislative
intent.
it
has
since
been
adopted
by
this
court
as
the
constitutional
test
for
defining
same
offense.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
brown
has
been
treated
--
it
has
been
treated
as
a
constitutional
test
in
several
other
cases.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
that
is
all
the
more
reason
it
would
seem
then,
the
fact
that
this
court
never
struck
down
the
decision
of
that
court.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
it
turned
on
the
fact
that
the
ohio
court
interpreted
its
two
statutes
--
the
two
statutes
it
issued
there
--
joyriding
and
grand
grand
larceny
as
bearing
a
greater
and
lesser
included
offense
relationship.
that
was
determinative
to
this
court
in
brown,
the
fact
that
--
one
was
a
lesser
included
offense
than
the
other,
and
this
court
held
that
they
were
the
same
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
if
they
had
consecutive
punishments
for
the
--
if
the
government
can
prove
any
kind
of
intent
with
respect
to
the
murder
and
prove
the
murder
based
on
that
theory
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
would
concede
that
that
would
be
more
difficult
problem.
there
is
i
would
concede
a
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
think
it
would
be
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
it
would
be
under
the
same
principle,
your
honor,
brown
v.
ohio
and
blockburger
as
now
incorporated
as
the
constitutional
test.
the
murder
in
that
hypothetical
you
postulate,
apart
from
the
felony
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
think
that
in
most
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well
again
your
honor,
in
most
situations,
such
as
the
case
here,
the
murder
can
be
proved
on
a
theory
other
than
that
of
felony
murder.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
and
where
it
can
be
proven
on
that
theory.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
certainly
if
he
eliminated
--
if
he
killed
the
woman
to
eliminate
her
as
the
only
witness
it
would
surely
be
a
premeditated
murder
and
if
the
state
were
able
to
prove
it
as
such
and,
if
it
did,
then
double
jeopardy
might
not
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
if
the
government
proceeds
on
the
felony
murder
statute
as
to
each
of
the
two?
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
then
each
felony
murder
would
be
punishable
consecutively,
but
not
consecutively
to
the
underlying
felony.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
it
would
be
double
jeopardy
to
punish
consecutively
for
the
rape
and
the
felony
murder,
not
to
punish
consecutively
for
the
felony
murders.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
in
d.c.
for
example,
your
honor,
if
you
eliminated
two
witnesses
your
penalty
for
two
counts
of
felony
murder
would
be
40
years
to
life,
which
means
that
you
would
be
eligible
for
parole
after
40
years.
i
don't
think
that,
facing
that
kind
of
penalty,
that
is
going
to
induce
criminals
to
want
to
murder
wantonly
without
thinking
about
it.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
the
opinion
ignored
this
court's
opinion.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
except
to
the
extent
that
in
the
murder
doctrine
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
i
am
not
absolutely
sure
exactly
what
our
brief
said
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
concerning
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
i
know
we
presented
it.
the
argument
had
not
been
decided.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
i
do
know
we
filed
a
supplemental
memorandum
after
brown
and
harris
were
decided,
bringing
those
cases
to
the
court
of
appeal's
attention.
we
also
petitioned
for
rehearing
en
banc
in
this
case,
making
the
argument
from
those
cases,
the
double
jeopardy
argument;
and
that
petition
was
denied.
so
it
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
their
opinion
they
simply
ignored
the
double
jeopardy
problem.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
that
is
not
generally
done
when
a
court
simply
makes
a
mistake
of
law.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
these
cases
your
honor
--
i
don't
know
--
they
were
not
called
to
their
attention
in
the
initial
brief,
because
it
hadn't
been
decided.
they
were
called
to
their
attention
in
the
supplemental
filing
we
made
and
we
called
it
to
their
attention
in
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
en
banc.
so
the
court
was
aware
of
them
when
it
issued
this
decision.
it
seems
to
us,
your
honors,
that
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
government
speak
of
the
felony
murder
rule
as
one
which
permits
the
jury
to
infer
the
requisite
intent
of
first
degree
murder
from
the
commission
of
the
underlying
felony
and
in
this
respect
they
fail
to
understand
the
fundamental
nature
of
that
doctrine.
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
felony
murder
statute
does
not
merely
create
a
permissive
presumption
that
the
accused
harbored
a
particular
mental
state
with
respect
to
the
killing.
the
jury
is
not
instructed
that
it
may
infer
that
the
defendant
had
the
mental
state
required
for
first
degree
premeditated
murder
from
the
fact
that
the
killing
occurred
in
the
course
of
a
felony.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no,
i
am
just
talking
right
now
your
honor
about
the
way
the
felony
murder
statute
in
fact
operates.
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
treat
it
as
though
it
simply
creates
a
presumption
and
that
the
jury
then
makes
its
own
determination
of
whether
there
was
in
fact
premeditation
and
deliberation.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
mis-described
in
the
course
of
its
opinion;
yes.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
and
that
misunderstanding
may
have
led
the
court
to
gloss
over
what
would
otherwise
be,
or
should
have
been
an
apparent
double
jeopardy
problem.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
we
are
quarreling
with
their
construction
of
the
statute
as
intended
to
permit
consecutive
punishments
here,
or
to
authorize
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
although
the
district
of
columbia
may
since
court
reorganization
bear
certain
of
the
hallmarks
of
a
state
and
state
court
decisions
may
not
be
reviewable
in
the
way
they
were
prior
to
court
reorganization,
where
there
is
a
constitutional
guarantee
at
stake
--
and
we
submit
that
even
our
legislative
argument
is
grounded
in
the
constitution,
the
government
itself
concedes
that
where
multiple
punishment
is
imposed
and
the
legislature
did
not
intend
it
be
imposed
there
is
a
violation,
a
substantive
violation
of
the
accused's
double
jeopardy
rights.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
your
honor,
there
is
a
penalty
for
rape
and
there
is
a
penalty
for
felony
murder.
it
is
our
position
that
congress
did
not
in
fact
provide
in
any
sense
that
these
punishments
be
impossible
consecutively.
in
fact
our
position
is
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
structure
of
these
statutes
indicates
if
anything
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
permit
the
courts
to
cumulate
punishments
for
felony
murder
and
the
underlying
felony.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
felony
murder
statute,
is
one
of
the
interests
that
is
protected
by
that
statute
is
the
interest
in
saving
human
life.
but
it
does
so
in
a
way
and
is
structured
in
such
a
way,
that
it
seems
apparent
another
interest
to
be
protected
in
that
rule
--
in
that
statute
is
the
same
interest
that
is
protected
by
the
underlying
felony.
congress
didn't
after
all
make
it
first
degree
murder
to
kill
under
any
circumstances
in
any
way.
it
didn't
impose
a
rule
of
strict
liability
for
any
killing,
and
impose
a
mandatory
sentence
of
20
years
to
life.
it
is
only
if
the
killing
occurs
in
the
course
of
the
felony
that
such
a
penalty
is
authorized.
it
is
our
position
that
that
indicates
very
strongly
that
what
congress
meant
to
do
by
the
felony
murder
statute
was
to
punish
the
person,
hold
him
culpable
both
for
killing
and
for
committing
the
underlying
felony
during
which
the
killing
occurred.
the
government
to
a
great
extent
i
think
gets
mileage
out
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
case
appears
clearly
to
involve
a
rape
and
a
murder
--
or
killing,
rather,
which
was
in
fact
done
with
a
culpable
mental
state.
and
the
jury
so
found,
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
just
the
second
degree?
the
penalty
would
be
up
to
15
years
to
life
but,
again,
unlike
first
degree
murder
a
judge
can
give
any
sentence
he
wants
in
the
district
of
columbia,
including
probation
for
second
degree
murder.
that
is
the
startling
thing.
perhaps
not
just
in
the
district
of
columbia,
although
i
think
it
may
be
more
extreme
here.
and
that
is
the
startling
thing
about
felony
murder
statutes.
they
make
murder
first
degree
murder.
they
make
a
killing,
rather,
first
degree
murder.
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
least,
that
killing
carries
a
mandatory
penalty
of
20
years
to
life.
no
matter
what
the
judge
wants
to
do
the
defendant
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
is
going
to
spend
20
years
of
his
life
in
jail.
any
other
form
of
homicide,
second
degree,
manslaughter,
the
judge
can
give
a
sentence
of
probation.
that
is
true
also
with
respect
to
any
of
the
underlying
felonies
can
be
the
predicate
for
felony
murder.
it
seems
also
that
the
structure
of
the
statute
reveals
that
congress
intended
to
punish
in
part
for
the
felony,
because
the
statute
imposes
a
rule
of
strict
liability
where
the
killing
occurs
in
the
course
of
six
enumerated
serious
felonies
and
requires
that
for
it
to
be
first
degree
murder,
a
felony,
as
any
other
felony
the
murder
has
to
be
purposeful.
this
in
our
view
also
indicates
that
congress
when
it
enacted
the
penalty
provisions
--
when
it
enacted
the
felony
murder
statute
and
structured
it
the
way
it
did
--
clearly
intended
that
the
punishment
for
the
felony
murder
would
incorporate
the
notion
of
liability
for
the
underlying
felony
as
well.
this
is
why
in
our
position
if
a
court
punishes
a
defendant
consecutively
for
a
felony
murder
and
for
the
felony
on
which
it
is
promised,
in
a
very
real
and
palpable
sense
it
is
imposing
double
punishment
for
that
felony.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
think
there
are
two
separate
interests
but
--
my
position
is
that
the
interest
protected
by
the
felony
murder
statute
is
an
interest
in
human
life
plus
an
interest
protected
by
whatever
the
underlying
felony
charge
is.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
when
you
punish,
you
are
protecting
both
those
interests.
when
you
punish
for
rape,
you
are
punishing
twice
for
the
rape.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
this
court
did
hold
however
that,
for
example,
the
death
penalty
would
be
inappropriate
for
rape.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
your
honor,
for
example
it
certainly
does
--
it
does
punish
rape
more
severely
than
it
does
manslaughter.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
but
again,
i
think
the
court
should
be
on
mind
that
the
felony
murder
statute
doesn't
work
only
where
there
is
a
rape.
it
works
with
any
one
of
six
enumerated
felonies
to
impose
a
rule
of
absolutely
strict
liability.
that
is
a
person
who
burns
down
a
house
he
believes
to
be
vacant
but
in
the
course
of
the
fire
a
derelict
who
happens
to
be
sleeping
in
it
is
killed,
is
punishable
by
a
mandatory
sentence
of
20
years
to
life.
now,
that
sentence
obviously
has
to
be
based
not
only
on
the
fact
that
a
killing
occurred,
because
that
killing
was
unforeseen
and
unintended,
but
on
the
fact
that
it
was
during
the
course
of
an
arson.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
an
easy
question.
i
think
the
position
--
what
test
this
court
has
adopted
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
the
position
that
i
think
the
court
has
adopted
and
the
position
which
we
take
in
our
brief
is
that
at
the
very
least
when
the
indictment
itself
reveals
that
one
offense
is
a
lesser
included
offense
than
the
other,
it
will
have
to
be
proved
in
order
to
prove
the
other,
then
it
should
be
treated
as
a
lesser
included
offense,
and
the
same
offense,
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
again,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
indictment
in
this
case,
for
example,
you
can
see
by
looking
at
the
indictment
that
to
prove
the
felony
murder
the
government
is
going
to
have
to
prove
the
felony
--
i
mean
the
rape,
to
prove
that
rape
was
premised
on
a
felony
murder,
they
are
going
to
have
prove
the
rape.
now,
again,
in
many
cases
a
murder
that
is
part
in
some
sense
of
a
felony
or
that
occurs
during
a
felony,
it
may
very
well
be
provable
as
a
murder,
as
a
homicide
on
some
theory
other
than
felony
murder.
and
where
the
government
does
that
it
is
not
relying
on
the
felony
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no,
the
defendant
here
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
he
was
never
charged
with
premeditated
murder.
this
is
not
the
case
where
there
is
any
kind
of
implied
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
but
here
he
wasn't
charged
with
first
degree
murder.
he
was
only
charged
with
second
degree
murder
and
he
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
of
course
we
are
not
challenging
the
conviction.
all
we
are
asking
for
is
remand
for
re-sentencing
with
respect
to
the
rape
and
the
felony
murder
premised
on
it.
he
stands
convicted
right
now
of
second
degree
murder,
incidentally.
that
conviction
was
never
set
aside.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
he
was
and
he
stands
convicted.
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
point
of
not
setting
that
--
i
don't
know
if
it
made
a
point,
but
it
didn't
set
aside
that
conviction.
it
vacated
the
sentence
on
that
count.
our
double
jeopardy
argument
would
not
preclude
a
court
on
remand
from
sentencing
consecutively
for
rape
and
for
second
degree
murder.
so
the
defendant
still
would
be,
in
our
view,
subject
to
a
penalty
of
up
to
30
years
to
life.
this
would
be
because
the
second
degree
murder
was
proved
without
reference
to
the
underlying
felony.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
and
the
underlying
felony.
it
is
our
position
that
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
it
is
argued
that
harris
is
dispositive,
your
honor.
the
government
takes
the
view
that
harris
is
different
because
that
involves
successive
prosecutions
as
opposed
to
consecutive
sentences
imposed
after
a
single
trial.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
the
government
argues
that
the
meaning
of
same
effect
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy
clause
varies
from
context
to
context.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that
is
the
government's
view,
yes.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
that
is
another
way
i
think
of
saying
the
same
offense
means
nothing,
really,
in
the
context
of
the
single
trial
other
than
what
the
legislature
wants
it
to
me.
but
the
legislature
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
the
government
argues
that
there
is
no
violation
of
blockburger
on
the
theory
that
here
anyone
of
several
felonies
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--
could
have
been
charged.
and
you
can
argue
that
position
carries
to
its
logical
extreme
--
or
you
can
just
--
well,
carries
to
its
extreme,
entails
completely
absurd
results,
as
i
think
we
showed
in
our
brief.
i
think
that
even
offenses
that
have
always
been
traditionally
considered
almost
paradigmatic
cases
of
a
greater
offense
and
a
lesser
included
offense
would
in
their
view
be
different,
not
be
the
same
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
also,
as
we
argue
in
our
brief,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decisions
of
this
court,
or
a
plurality
opinion
of
this
court
in
jeffers
as
well
as
the
dissenting
opinion
in
jeffers,
both
indicate
that
in
deciding
whether
two
offenses
--
whether
one
offense
is
a
lesser
included
offense
than
the
other,
you
look
to
the
indictment.
you
don't
just
look
to
the
statute
in
the
abstract
and
see
what
could
have
been
charged.
you
at
least
look
to
the
indictment
--
if
you
don't
look
to
what
happens
in
trial,
you
at
least
look
to
the
indictment.
and
if
you
look
at
the
indictment
here
you
know
from
looking
at
it
that
the
felony
murder
did
--
the
felony
murder
premised
on
the
rape
was
just
that,
premised
on
the
rape.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
think
that
jeffers
and
iannelli
read
together
certainly
do.
the
way
jeffers
talked
about
iannelli
and
the
way
jeffers
emphasized
--
i
think
it
was
footnotes
15
and
16
of
iannelli
--
i
think
the
court
was
making
just
about
this
point.
i
have
very
little
time
left.
i
would
just
say
that
i
think
our
brief
adequately
covers
our
argument
that
even
if
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
apply
here
to
absolutely
bar
consecutive
punishments,
that
is
even
if
the
government's
position
is
accepted,
any
kind
of
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
relevant
statutes
would
have
led
the
court
of
appeals
to
conclude
that
congress
did
not
here
intend
consecutive
punishments.
the
legislative
history
of
the
penalty
provisions
to
the
felony
murder
statutes
which
were
enacted
in
1962
show
quite
clearly
that
those
members
of
congress
who
addressed
themselves
to
this
question
felt
that
for
a
fatal
felony
murder
the
defendant's
effective
sentence
should
not
be
greater
than
the
sentence
for
pre-meditated
first
degree
murder,
that
is
20
years
to
life.
in
the
government's
view,
every
time
a
felony
murder
is
proved
the
defendant
would
be
subject
to
a
penalty
considerably
longer
than
20
years
to
life
sentence
which
the
congressmen
thought
was
sufficient.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
all
the
congressmen
that
spoke
to
the
issue
indicated
that
they
thought
20
years
in
prison
for
the
single
felony
murder
was
enough
time
to
be
eligible
for
parole.
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
is
going
to
be
paroled,
but
it
means
he
would
be
eligible
after
20
years.
it
is
also,
we
argue,
implicit
in
the
structure
of
the
statute.
but
more
importantly,
it
is
our
argument
that
if
double
jeopardy
doesn't
operate
to
bar
absolutely
punishment
for
two
offenses
that
are
the
same,
under
blockburger,
at
the
very
least
it
creates
a
very
strong
constitutionally-based
presumption
that
where
two
offenses
are
the
same,
under
blockburger,
consecutive
punishment
should
not
be
imposed
unless
the
legislative
intent
that
they
be
imposed
is
unmistakably
clear.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
it
is
our
position
this
would
be
a
constitutional
basis,
a
constitutionally-based
presumption.
because
we
are
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no,
because
if
the
court
is
wrong
when
it
imposed
are
sanctions
consecutive
punishment,
then
there
is
in
fact
a
substantive
violation
of
the
defendant's
double
jeopardy
rights.
so
where
do
you
have
a
mistake
in
this
area?
you
have
a
violation
of
a
specific
constitutional
guarantee.
interestingly
enough,
i
think
this
position
is
is
the
position
taken
in
the
yale
law
journal
note
which
the
government
relies
on
so
heavily
in
its
brief,
to
try
to
argue
that,
the
question
of
whether
two
offenses
are
the
same
should
be
entirely
for
the
legislature.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
begin
with,
it
is
our
view
that
if
congress
did
not
intend
consecutive
punishment
here,
did
not
authorized
such
punishment,
then
when
the
lower
court
makes
a
mistake
of
that
sort
it
is
making
a
mistake
which
results
in
the
denial
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
and
therefore
this
court
should,
and
must,
review
that
legislative
--
that
determination
of
legislative
intent,
it
is
not
like
other
kinds
of
errors
in
construing
legislative
intent.
on
the
constitutional
issue
itself
though,
it
is
our
position
--
and
we
submit
it
is
borne
out
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
companion
case
of
pearce
v.
north
carolina,
the
case
of
rica
v.
alabama,
in
that
case
the
defendant
pled
guilty
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment.
two
and
a
half
years
into
his
term
he
successfully
challenged
his
convictions
in
a
petition
for
quorum
novus
relief
in
the
state
courts.
he
then
was
tried
on
the
same
charges
that
he
had
pled
to
and
he
was
convicted.
the
judge
imposed
a
sentence
and
ordered
that
credit
not
be
given
for
time
served.
he
imposed
a
25-year
sentence
and
ordered
that
no
credit
for
the
2-1/2
years
be
given
for
time
served.
now,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
judge
could
have
given
a
27-1/2-year
sentence
with
credit
for
time
served.
that
would
have
been
within
the
statutory
maximum
permitted
for
the
offenses
of
which
he
was
convicted.
nevertheless,
this
court
vacated
and
ordered
that
credit
be
given
--
it
didn't
vacate
it,
but
ordered
that
credit
be
given
for
time
served
because
by
failing
to
give
credit
for
time
served,
the
defendant
was
twice
punished
for
the
same
offense,
even
though
he
could
have
been
punished
to
the
same
extent
with
credit
for
time
served.
that
decision
was
a
unanimous
decision
of
that
court.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
certainly
when
a
defendant
moves
to
have
his
sentence
set
aside,
he
waives
any
kind
of
double
jeopardy
claim
he
might
have
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
a
second
sentencing
proceeding
occurs.
so
that
case
could
not
have
turned
on
the
fact
that
--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
larger
sentence.
it
may
well
be
as
this
court
held
in
pearce
that
a
longer
sentence
after
appeal
is
illegal
because
of
due
process
considerations.
pearce
is
not
a
double
jeopardy
case;
it
is
a
companion
case,
however.
rica
v.
alabama
is
a
double
jeopardy
case,
it
relies
on
ex
parte
lange.
and
the
court
made
it
clear
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
forbid
the
state
from
giving
him
a
sentence
which
did
not
give
him
credit
for
time
served
even
though
it
could
have
given
an
equivalent
sentence
with
credit
for
time
served.
thank
you.
