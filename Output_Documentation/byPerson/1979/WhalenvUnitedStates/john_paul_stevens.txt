mr.
frey,
can
i
address
your
theory
with
a
thought
that
has
been
running
through
my
mind.
you
remember
a
year
or
two
ago
--
i
think
you
argued
the
case,
it
came
from
the
seventh
circuit
--
there
were
two
gun
control
statutes.
one
provided
i
think
a
three-year
sentence
and
the
other
a
one-year
sentence
which
overlapped.
and
the
seventh
circuit
had
held
that
since
it
was
basically
the
same
crime
you
can
only
impose
the
lesser
sentence.
and
i
think
you
persuaded
us
to
reverse
and
say,
well
the
government
can
choose
between
the
two
and
we
can
impose
--
go
under
the
section
that
allowed
the
longer
sentence.
i
take
it
your
view
now
would
be
that
they
could
apply
both,
even
though
they
are
precisely
the
same
offense
they
could
impose
40
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
the
government
didn't
have
to
in
that
case.
is
that
correct?
and
similarly,
if
in
the
confusion
of
legislative
process
they
had
enacted
the
same
provisions
14
different
times
throughout
the
criminal
code
they
can
impose
--
cumulate
all
14
sentences
even
though
they
are
the
same
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem,
that
is
what
you
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
there
is
no
constitutional
problems.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
saying
in
the
trial.
i
think
you
have
agreed
there
couldn't
be
separate
trials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
in
one
trial
congress
--
you
could
cumulate
punishments
as
often
as
you
want.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
that
approach,
isn't
some
felony
a
necessary
element
of
proof?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
an
essential
element
of
the
compound
felony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
some
predicate
felony
is
an
essential
element,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
virtues
i
always
thought
the
blockburger
test
had
was
it
was
logically
very,
very
easy
to
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
if
the
predicate
felony
is
rape.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
if
you
look
at
the
felony
murder
statute
you
can't
find
a
basis
for
convicting
unless
you
also
convict
him
of
a
felony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
necessarily
rape,
no
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
same
way
that
my
hypothetical
example
of
34
different
statutes
on
the
same
offense
would
authorize
34
punishments
--
precisely
that
same
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
should
not
reach
unless
we
are
satisfied
under
bolckburger
and
all
the
rest
that
clearly
are
--
there
clearly
was
an
intent
to
impose
multiple
punishment
under
two
separate
provisions.
