mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
began
on
january
3,
1974
when
carol
owens,
a
student
visiting
washington,
dc
for
a
brief
course
of
study
was
robbed
at
gunpoint
and
sexually
molested
by
the
respondent
in
a
stall
at
the
women’s
restroom
near
the
washington
monument.
during
the
course
of
what
must
have
been
a
most
harrowing
experience,
owens
had
an
extended
opportunity
to
observe
her
assailant
at
close
range.
she
promptly
reported
the
crime
to
the
police
and
provided
them
with
the
description
of
the
robber.
three
days
later,
two
other
women
were
robbed
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
in
the
same
rest
room
and
they
too
gave
the
police
a
description
of
their
assailant,
which
generally
correspondent
with
the
description
given
by
owens.
subsequently
on
january
9th,
two
park
policemen
on
duty
at
the
monument
grounds
spotted
respondent
who
appeared
to
them
to
fit
the
description
given
by
the
robbery
victims.
they
approached
him
and
during
a
brief
conversation
were
told
that
his
name
was
keith
crews
that
he
had
walked
away
from
school,
but
he
was
16
years
old.
after
respondent
went
into
the
men’s
room,
the
officers
conversed
with
the
tour
guide
who
told
him
that
he
believe
respondent
had
been
at
the
monument
grounds
on
the
day
of
the
owens
robbery.
on
the
basis
of
this
additional
information,
the
officers
detained
respondent
and
called
for
the
assistance
of
the
detective
who
was
investigating
the
robberies.
he
arrived
shortly
and
attempted
to
take
a
photograph
of
respondent,
but
was
unsuccessful.
he
thereupon
ordered
that
the
respondent
be
taken
to
the
nearby
park
police
station,
which
was
done.
respondent
was
detained
at
the
station
for
perhaps
as
long
as
an
hour
during
which
time
his
photograph
was
taken
and
the
school
was
called,
he
was
then
released.
several
days
later,
the
photograph
taken
during
the
detention
was
shown
to
owens,
the
robbery
victim
in
a
photo
array
and
she
identified
the
respondent
as
her
assailant.
on
the
basis
of
this
identification
he
was
arrested,
again
identified
in
the
lineup
and
ultimately
brought
to
trial.
upon
respondent’s
motion
to
suppress
all
identifications
of
him,
the
trial
court
determined
that
the
act
of
taking
respondent
to
the
police
station
was
an
illegal
arrest.
the
pretrial
identifications
were
fruit
of
that
arrest
and
must
be
suppressed,
but
that
the
in-court
identification
of
respondent
by
his
alleged
victims
had
an
independent
basis
derived
from
their
substantial
opportunity
to
observe
him
during
the
course
of
the
crime
and
would
not
be
suppressed.
the
trial
was
then
held.
owens
positively
identified
respondent
as
her
assailant,
and
he
was
convicted
by
the
jury
of
armed
robbery.
on
appeal,
the
en
banc
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
concluded
that
owens’
in-court
testimony
identifying
respondent
as
the
robber
should
have
been
suppressed
as
a
fruit
of
the
initial
illegal
detention
of
owens.
now,
we
argue
in
this
case
for
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
three
separate
grounds,
any
one
of
which
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
reversal.
the
first
ground
is
our
contention
that
the
in-court
identification
testimony
was
not
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
police
conduct.
the
second
ground
is
that
under
attenuation
analysis,
any
taint,
if
it
was
a
fruit
should
be
held
attenuated.
and
the
third
ground
is
that
in
any
event
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
at
least,
if
not
generally,
that
the
testimony
of
the
victim
of
the
crime,
particularly
a
crime
of
violence
ought
not
to
be
excluded
as
a
matter
of
exclusionary
rule
policy.
now,
i’d
like
to
consider
first
the
question
which
i
think
is
a
perplexing
one
of
whether
owens’
in-court
identification
testimony
was
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
detention
of
respondent
crews,
a
subject
on
which
both
sides
have
spilled
a
great
deal
of
ink.
it
is
a
given
in
this
case
that
from
the
time
of
the
robbery
to
the
time
of
trial,
owens
possessed
on
the
basis
of
her
observations
during
the
robbery,
the
ability
to
identify
her
assailant.
nothing
that
happened
during
the
course
of
the
investigation
of
this
case
altered
or
enhanced
that
ability
except
in
one
respect,
the
respondent
was
in
court
to
be
identified
because
of
a
chain
of
events
proceeding
from
the
unlawful
taking
of
his
photograph
and
of
course,
if
he
were
not
present
in
court,
owens
could
not
have
identified
him
as
her
assailant.
we
stress
the
untainted
nature
of
owens
inherent
ability
to
identify
respondent,
while
he
stresses
the
uselessness
of
that
ability
without
his
presence
to
be
identified.
what
is
really
going
on
here?
is
it,
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
insist
simply
a
wholly
conventional
application
of
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine?
is
the
victim’s
identification
of
her
attacker
really
no
different
from
drugs
seized
from
a
house
during
an
illegal
warrantless
search
or
a
firearm
seized
from
a
person
of
an
illegally-arrested
suspect?
it
doesn’t
seem
to
be
the
same
on
the
surface
at
least
to
us,
but
let’s
look
more
deeply
and
see
whether
the
superficial
appearances
are
deceiving.
now,
we
submit
that
a
close
look
at
this
case
reveals
what
is
actually
happening
here
and
that
is,
that
the
court
is
suppressing
the
defendant’s
presence
at
trial
on
the
ground
that
the
probable
cause
underlying
his
arrest
and
indictment
is
the
product
of
the
illegal
detention.
respondent
would
agree,
i
think,
that
the
court
was
not
suppressing
and
could
not
properly
have
suppressed
owens’
testimony
describing
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
or
generally
describing
her
recollection
of
the
assailant.
it
is
just
unconceivable
that
those
things
could
be
fruits.
the
only
arguable
suppressible
ingredient
of
her
testimony
concerns
her
ability
to
point
to
the
respondent
in
the
courtroom
and
say,
“that’s
the
man.”
now
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
regard
is
perhaps
most
clearly
laid
out
in
a
portion
of
the
opinion
where
they
are
actually
discussing
the
temporal
proximity
factor
and
this
is
a
page
38
(a)
to
39
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
the
court
says,
“while
the
initial
arrest
and
the
taking
of
the
photograph
did
occur
on
january
9,
1974,
the
illegality
in
this
case
did
not
end
on
that
date.
he
eventual
rearrest”
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
did
not
end
on
that
date.
“the
eventual
rearrest
and
confinement
of
mr.
crews
and
his
ultimate
appearance
at
trial
were
all
based
on
tainted
facts.
the
government
demonstrated
no
independent
basis
for
rearrest.”
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
fairness
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
the
issue
is
a
little
bit
more
complicated
than
that
because
the
court,
i
think
suggests
and
odd
believe
respondents
suggests
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
may
have
an
independent
--
no,
even
if
it
is
more
complicated,
we’re
still
going
to
win
this
case,
i
think.
but
the
court
suggests
that
if
you
had
an
independent,
wholly,
untainted
basis
for
probable
cause,
then
there
would
be
no
problem
even
though
he
may
have
been
illegally
arrested
at
some
stage
in
the
proceedings
because
you
could
justify
bringing
him
into
court
on
that
basis.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
we
we’re
heading
is
toward
store
the
ker-frisbie
kind
of
problem,
i
will
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment
because
i
think
it
is
very
pertinent
to
this
and
if
you
would
just
bear
with
me
very
briefly,
i’ll
be
right
there.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
the
entire
course
of
events
was
accomplished
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
since
apparently
there
was
no
independent
probable
cause
for
official
detention
the
wrong
thus
continued.
and
respondent
in
his
brief
also
suggests
that
the,
i
think
it’s
page
46,
note
37
that
the
identification
testimony
by
owens
would
not
be
suppressible
if
the
government
had
untainted,
independent
probable
cause
to
try
the
respondent.
even,
and
i
think,
although
you
have
to
ask
him,
that
he
would
accept
that
view
even
if
the
proceedings
in
some
way
originated
with
an
illegal
arrest
of
the
respondent.
now,
we
are
prepared
to
accept
the
notion
that
the
respondent’s
presence
in
court
in
this
case
was
logically
a
fruit
of
his
illegal
detention.
what
we
do
not
accept
because
it
is
contrary
to
settle
law,
is
that
his
presence
in
court
is
subject
to
suppression.
that
a
defendant
may
not
object
to
being
tried
on
the
ground
that
his
presence
in
court
is
the
product
of
an
illegal
seizure
of
his
person
is
settled
by
the
ker-frisbie
line
of
cases.
and
this
court
said
in
gerstein
against
pugh
the
following
on
this
point.
“in
holding
of
the
prosecutor’s
assessment
of
probable
cause
is
not
sufficient
alone
to
justify
restraint
of
liberty
pending
trial,
we
do
not
imply
that
the
accused
is
entitled
to
judicial
oversight
or
review
of
the
decision
to
prosecute.
instead,
we
adhere
to
the
court’s
prior
holdings
that
a
judicial
hearing
is
not
prerequisite
to
prosecution
by
information,
nor
do
we
retreat
from
the
established
rule
that
illegal
arrests
or
detention
does
not
void
a
subsequent
conviction.”
now
in
my
view,
there
is
only
one
arguably
material
distinction
between
the
ker-frisbie
line
of
cases
and
the
present
case,
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
it,
and
i
should
address
it.
the
distinction
is
that
in
the
ker-frisbie
line
of
cases,
the
probable
cause
to
try
the
defendant
was
possessed
by
the
police
prior
to
the
time
that
the
defendant
was
kidnapped
in
violation
of
his
fourth
amendment
rights
and
brought
to
court
for
trial.
and
i
think
respondent
would
say
that
is
critical
difference.
we
say
that
distinction
does
not
help
the
respondent
and
we
rely
for
that
on
the
costello,
blue,
collander
line
of
cases
and
we
have
not
discussed
that
in
the
brief,
so
i
do
want
to
stress
it
here.
it’s
the
fruit
of
some
further
thought
in
the
course
of
preparing
the
argument.
he
is
saying,
“you
can’t
bring
me
to
trial
because
the,
in
effect,
the
grand
jury
proceeding
that
found
probable
cause
to
try
me
was
tainted.
it
was
based
on
illegally-seized
evidence,
this
photograph
and
the
out-of-court
identification.
you
have
no
business
having
me
in
this
courtroom
and
therefore
the
inchoate
ability
that
the
police
already
possessed
to
have
owens
identify
me
should
not
be
usable
by
the
prosecution
because
it
can’t
properly
be
put
together
with
her
pointing
finger
at
me.”
now,
however,
collander
establishes,
costello
establishes,
blue
establishes
that
you
cannot
attack
the
indictment
or
your
presence
in
court
on
the
basis
that
it
is
predicated
on
illegally-seized
evidence
or,
indeed,
on
the
general
lack
of
probable
cause
to
support
the
indictment.
so
if
we
are
right
that
the
respondent
cannot
suppress
the
fact
that
his
presence
in
court
then
the
only
logical
basis
for
his
claim
is
that
owens’
in-court
identification
was
a
fruit
of
his
illegal
detention
disappears.
now,
i
would
like
to
present
a
hypothetical
at
this
point
which
i
think
is
quite
illuminating.
let
us
suppose
that
during
the
course
of
the
robbery,
owens
had
a
camera
and
she
took
a
picture
of
her
assailant
and
when
she
went
to
the
police
she
gave
the
police
the
undeveloped
roll
of
film
and
she
said,
“i
think
i
have
a
picture
of
him
on
this
roll
of
film.”
she
also
gave
the
general
description,
as
she
did
in
this
case.
while
the
film
is
being
developed,
the
police
officers
see
respondent,
exactly
the
same
procedure
as
here
goes
on
they
say
to
themselves,
“we’d
better
get
his
picture
so
that
we
can
compare
it
with
what
may
come
out
on
the
film.”
they
get
his
picture,
they
compare
it
with
what
came
out
on
the
film
they
say
it’s
a
perfect
match.
he’s
indicted,
he’s
brought
into
court,
we
introduced
the
picture
and
we
say
to
the
jury,
“look
at
this
picture.
look
at
the
man.
it’s
the
same
man.”
now,
in
our
view,
this
undeveloped
photograph
is
the
same
thing
as
the
mental
image
that
owens
had
of
the
crime
and
of
her
assailant,
and
we
do
not
see
how
it
could
possibly
be
concluded
in
the
photograph
hypothetical
that
the
photograph
is
a
fruit
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you’re
saying
invalid
on
fifth
--
on
stovall
or
wade
grounds,
or
invalid
on
fourth
amendments
grounds?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
definitely
not.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
has
to
be
found
that
is
untainted
by
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
am
sure
that
my
colleague
will,
perhaps
be
more
motivated
to
answer
that
question
than
i
am.
the
court
of
appeals
believed
it
was
different
because
it
believed
that
in
the
case
of
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
different
policies
were
involved
and
in
the
case
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
they
said
what
they
had
here
was
a
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
case
under
the
fourth
amendment
under
wong
sun
and
brown
against
illinois.
and
therefore
they
said
the
cases
like
manson
that
say
you
can
use
the
identification
if
it’s
not
tainted
by
the
improper
out-of-court
identification
are
not
controlling.
now,
we
say
they
are
at
least
instructive
on
the
matter
of
exclusionary
rule
policy.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
that
he
couldn’t
be.
that’s
the
issue
that’s
before
the
court,
assuming
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
necessary
in
justice
white’s
hypothetical.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
past
cases
of
this
court
that
have
dealt
with
the
wade,
gilbert,
stovall
line
of
cases
have
addressed
it
in
terms
of
due
process
and
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
policies.
now,
i
think
they
are
instructive.
i
think
they
are
helpful.
but
when
we
analyze
the
thing
through,
we
did
not
feel
that
they
were
necessarily
controlling,
in
the
same
sense
that
i
feel
analysis
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
frisbie
combined
with
costello
and
collander
are
necessarily
controlling
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
those
cases
are
concerned
in
part
with
reliability
and
i
take
it
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
as
the
court
said
in
ceccolini
is
not
--
does
not
focus
on
the
reliability
of
the
testimony
that
is
or
is
not
subject
to
exclusion.
i
think
that
my
colleague
will
be
far
more
motivated
to
press
these
distinctions
than
i
am.
now,
if
i
can
move
from
this
point,
although
it
could
be
discussed
at
some
length
to
a
second
point,
which
is
hotly
disputed
between
us.
in
connection
with
attenuation
analysis,
we
--
excuse
me
a
second.
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
and
we
all
seemed
to
be
agreed
that
the
focal
or
critical
concern
with
regard
to
attenuation
and
i
am
now
assuming
that
you
somehow
conclude
that
this
is
a
fruit
and
attenuation
analysis
is
proper,
is
the
gravity
of
the
constitutional
violation.
now,
our
submission
is
relatively
straightforward
in
this
regard.
first
we
say
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
in
this
record
for
concluding
that
the
police
acted
in
knowing
or
willful
disregard
of
their
constitutional
obligations.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
deny
that
they
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
respondent’s
possible
involvement
in
the
crimes.
he
fit
the
general
description,
he
was
identified
as
having
been
at
the
scene
on
the
day
of
the
robbery
and
the
police
had
at
least
substantial
cause
to
wonder
what
he
was
doing
at
the
monument
grounds
on
a
rainy
january
day.
now,
under
the
circumstances,
it
was
entirely
reasonable
for
the
police
to
detain
him
briefly
even
to
the
extent
of
trying
to
get
his
photograph.
now,
it
may
be,
as
the
lower
courts
have
held
and
we
haven’t
sought
review
of
that
question
here,
that
the
basis
for
their
suspicion
was
not
enough
to
justify
the
further
step
of
taking
him
to
the
police
station,
detaining
him
for
an
additional
hour
or
so,
taking
his
photograph
and
calling
his
school
while
he
was
being
held
there.
but
whether
that’s
so
or
not
so,
it
simply
seems
inconceivable
to
me
that
it
can
be
argued
that
their
actions
were
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
this
defendant
and
the
same
sense
that
it
was
concluded
by
the
court
in
brown
against
illinois.
indeed,
i
might
mention
that
there
are
cases
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
that
suggest
in
closely
analogous
situations
that
a
suspect
detain
on
reasonable
suspicion
maybe
taken
for
a
show-up
to
the
scene
of
the
crime.
now,
perhaps
those
cases
would
not
control
this
case,
but
in
any
event,
i
think
there
is
no
basis
for
concluding
that
the
officers
knew
what
they
were
doing
was
wrong
and
flagrantly
ignored
their
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct.
we
do
not
challenge
that.
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
review
that
except
insofar
as
the
court
reaches
the
question
of
the
flagrancy
of
the
violation
as
a
consideration
and
attenuation
analysis.
now,
it’s
equally
significant
that
the
scope
of
the
violation
in
this
case
was
not
serious.
i
mean,
compare
it
to
brown
against
illinois.
the
police
break
in
to
brown’s
apartment
when
he
is
not
there.
when
he
comes
home
they
grab
him
with
guns
drawn
and
say
he
is
under
arrest.
they
take
him
down
to
the
station
house
with,
mind
you,
no
basis
at
all
for
doing
this,
and
they
hold
him
for
i
think
six
hours
during
which
he
is
interrogated.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
it
is
proper.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
not
just
the
matter
of
cause
and
effect
but
i
think
this
court’s
decisions
make
that
quite
clear.
it’s
certainly
not
a
matter
of
but
for
causation.
in
ceccolini,
i
think
the
court
stated
that
we
are
not
talking
about
causation
in
the
sense
of
the
physical
sciences,
but
a
different
concept
and
i
think
justice
powell
in
his
concurrence
in
brown
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
said
that
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
determine
the
circumstances
in
which
exclusion
is
useful
as
a
means
of
controlling
police
misconduct
as
against
a
cost
to
society
of
the
result
that’s
being
achieved
by
excluding
the
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it’s
definitely
a
correct
approach,
yes.
now,
respondent
repeatedly
asserts
in
his
briefs
that
there
was
bad
faith
and
that
the
officers
knew
they
didn’t
have
probable
cause
and
this
was
a
flagrant
violation,
but
i
read
it
carefully
and
all
i
find
are
assertions.
now,
i
think
i
like
to
conclude
because
i
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
respondent
in
his
brief
has
repeatedly
accused
us
of
using
abstruse
metaphysical
concepts
in
arguing
this
case.
all
right.
let’s
put
sophisticated
legal
argument
aside
and
let’s
look
at
this
case
as
an
intelligent
layman
might.
common
sense
simply
cries
out
for
reversal
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
case.
there
is
simply
no
process
of
dry
logic
that
ultimately
can
justify
the
holding
that
carol
owens
may
not
stand
at
the
bar
of
justice
and
identify
to
a
jury
the
man
who
robbed
her,
when
her
knowledge
of
the
man
and
his
actions
are
the
product
of
her
experiences
during
the
crime
itself
and
not
of
any
subsequent
police
misconduct.
d.c.
circuit
aptly
summarized
this
common
sense
policy
aspect
of
the
case
in
payne,
where
they
said,
“the
consequence
of
accepting
appellant’s
contention
in
the
present
situation
would
be
that
the
witness
would
be
forever
precluded
from
testifying
against
the
defendant
in
court
merely
because
he
had
complied
with
the
request
of
the
police
that
he
come
to
police
headquarters
and
had
there
identified
the
defendant
as
the
robber.
such
a
result
is
unthinkable.
the
suppression
of
the
testimony
of
the
complaining
witness
is
not
the
right
way
to
control
the
conduct
of
the
police
but
to
the
advance
the
administration
of
justice.”
accordingly,
for
that
reason
and
the
others
that
i
have
discussed,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
and
i
will
reserve
the
balance
on
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
couple
of
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
respondent
states
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
police
that
knew
they
were
acting
unlawfully
and
i
simply
have
not
found
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
anywhere.
it
is
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
the
action
as
flagrant
and
the
basis
for
its
characterization
of
it
as
flagrant
was
it
was
that
it
was
purposeful
for
an
investigative
motive.
now,
the
difficulty
that
we
have
with
respondent’s
effort
to
use
that
as
a
touchstone
is
that
it
sweeps
far
too
broadly.
the
--
virtually
all
searches,
there
may
be
a
few
exceptions
are
made
for
an
investigative
motive
or
the
detentions
of
suspected
individuals
and
you
may
have
the
occasional
case
like
ceccolini
where
it’s
random
curiosity
or
a
case
where
they’re
investigating
one
crime
and
stumble
across
evidence
of
another
but
normally,
there
is
the
element
of
purpose.
that
can’t
be
the
end
of
the
analysis.
it
must
be
the
in
determining
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
conduct
that
justifies
exclusion
under
the
circumstances
you
look
at
the
flagrancy
and
the
willfulness
of
the
misconduct.
now,
here
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
police
had
no
way
of
apprehending
mr.
crews
and
carrying
on
their
investigation
of
this
quite
serious
crime
if
they
did
not
take
them
illegally
to
the
police
headquarters
to
photograph
him.
and
then
obviously
is
not
so.
they
knew
his
name.
they
knew
he
was
a
student.
if
they
had
realized
that
what
they
were
doing
was
illegal,
which
by
the
way
had
the
consequences
of
costing
them
the
out-of-court
identifications
and
which
for
all
they
knew
with
the
time
might
have
cost
them
the
in-court
identification,
if
the
trial
court
had
not
found
that
to
be
independent.
they
could
have
called
the
school
system
said,
“where
does
keith
crews
go
to
school?”
they
could
have
sent
an
officer
out
there
and
taken
his
photographs
at
school.
so
it
isn’t
as
though
this
was
a
question
of
the
only
way
to
enforce
the
law
is
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
which
is
what
they
seem
to
be
saying.
there
were
other
alternatives
and
the
conventional
deterrence
that
derives
from
excluding
conventional
fruits
of
an
illegal
search
is,
in
our
view,
ample
to
deter
this
kind
of
misconduct.
of
course,
it
won’t
always
deter
it
but
it’s
clear
that
the
policy
of
this
court
is
not
to
press
the
principal
of
deterrence
and
exorable
to
its
farthest
point.
all
one
needs
to
do
is
look
at
the
standing
cases
to
see
that
there
are
other
factors
that
must
be
balanced
against
deterrence.
and
one
final
thing,
with
regard
to
this
argument
that
focuses
on
the
purpose
to
get
a
particular
kind
of
evidence,
the
consequence
of
that
argument
is
that
in
the
case
like
davis
against
mississippi
or
bynum,
which
davis
discussed,
the
first
fingerprint
taken
from
the
scene
of
the
crime
ought
to
be
suppressed,
because
the
purpose
of
the
police
in
arresting
or
rounding
up
people
was
to
take
their
fingerprints
to
match
against
the
fingerprints
in
the
scene
of
the
crime.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
anything
in
davis
that
remotely
suggests
and
indeed
approves
bynum
with
the
notion
that
in
the
re-trial
you
could
still
use
that
first
fingerprint
and
here
we
say
that
carol
owen’s
recollection
of
the
robbery
is
like
that
first
fingerprint.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
not,
if
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
is.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
because
what
we
you
have
in
the
case
of
the
out-of-court
identification
is
testimony
about
an
event,
that
is
a
lineup
which
was
held
–
let’s
take
the
photo
array
first,
that’s
the
easy
case.
the
photo
array
involved
the
use
of
a
photograph
--
[voice
overlap]
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
is
the
lineup
identification
or
the
in-court
identification?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
in-court
identification
should
come
in
the
out-of-court
identification
i
found
that
a
difficult
question,
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
why
would
that
be
a
fruit?
well,
the
evidence
about
the
out-of-court
identification
is
evidence
about
an
event
which
was
created
by
the
police
in
the
process
of
conducting
the
investigation
which
began
with
illegally
securing
his
photograph.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand
that,
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
what
we’re
talking
about
a
trial
is
not
testimony
about
an
event
that
occurred
subsequent
to
and
as
a
product
of
the
police
illegality.
we’re
talking
about
the
testimony
of
the
witness
about
the
crime.
the
crime
was
not
the
fruit
of
an
illegality.
the
witnesses’
recollection
was
not
the
fruit
and
the
trial
is
the
main
event.
the
defendant
is
there
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
we
are
confident
that
the
answer
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct.
