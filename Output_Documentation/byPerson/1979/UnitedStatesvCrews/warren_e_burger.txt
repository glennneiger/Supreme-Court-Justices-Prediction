we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
crews.
mr.
frey,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
those
cases,
mr.
frey,
wasn’t
it
indicated
that
the
defendant
can
of
course
attack
the
in-court
identification
by
showing
that
it
have
this
basis
in
an
effort
to
persuade
the
jury
to
disregard
the
in-court
identification?
or
undermine
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kohlman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
policemen
taking
the
picture
at
the
washington
monument,
right
at
the
outset
had
succeeded
and
got
a
good
picture
and
she
identified
that,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
affect
the
identification
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
matter,
now,
i
take
it
you
adopted
the
standard
of
the
intelligent
layman
exercising
common
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say,
“produce
evidence,”
do
you
mean
have
a
lineup
in
which
someone,
possible
victims,
can
identify?
is
that
producing
evidence?
is
that
what
you
mean
by
producing
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
are
you
attacking
the
very
idea
of
having
a
lineup?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
the
police
said
he
would
regard
this
as
much
more
severe
than
the
police
conduct
in
brown?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
this
was
the
most
flagrant
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
is
more
flagrant
and
more
purposeful
than
the
conduct
of
the
police
in
bringing
frisbie
to
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they
do
it
by
kidnapping
instead
of
using
the
extradition
procedures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
78-777,
united
states
against
crews
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
