mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
too,
ask
this
court
to
use
common
sense
ultimately
in
deciding
this
case,
and
we
submit
the
common
sense
dictates
that
if
there
ever
is
a
case
in
which
the
exclusionary
rule
ought
to
be
applied,
it’s
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
we
view
the
facts
in
this
case
the
same
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
we
see
this
case
therefore,
as
a
very
simple
straight
forward
case.
the
police
illegally
arrested
respondent.
they
deliberately,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court’s
findings,
violated
his
fourth
amendment
rights
and
they
had
a
purpose.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
no
question
about
it.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
police
at
the
time
that
they
made
the
arrest
knew
only
the
following.
they
were
looking
for
a
suspect
that
was
from
15
to
17
years
old,
was
a
negro
youth,
and
had
a
smooth
complexion.
and
the
police
happened
to
be
in
a
public
area,
the
washington
monument,
six
days
after
the
offense.
they
also
knew
that
the
respondent
might
have
been
in
that
public
area
six
days
earlier.
that’s
all
the
police
knew
at
the
time
that
they
arrested
the
respondent
in
this
case.
and
they
did
put
him
under
arrest.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
further
looking
at
these
facts,
so
that
they
put
him
under
arrest
for
a
purpose,
for
a
design.
they
wanted
one
specific
fruit.
they
wanted
identification
testimony.
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
on
that
and,
in
fact,
the
police
officers
at
the
hearing
conceded
that,
that
that
was
the
purpose
for
conducting
this
flagrant
unlawful
arrest.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
that
is
a
closer
question,
your
honor.
we
never
--
the
respondent
never
had
to
address
the
illegality
of
either
the
first
detention,
when
they
stopped
and
talked
to
the
respondent
for
three
to
five
minutes,
or
the
second
detention,
if
they
have
just
simply
been
able
to
take
his
picture
because
this
particular
event
went
much
longer.
this
respondent,
your
honors,
was
taken
to
the
police
station,
held
for
over
an
hour.
he
was
fingerprinted,
searched,
questioned
and
his
picture
was
taken.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
that,
as
the
court
of
appeal
saw
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
yes,
your
honor
and
we
do
at
this
point
have
an
exclusionary
rule,
and
if
there
ever
is
a
case
in
which
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied,
it’s
in
a
situation
where
the
police
have
identifiable
fruits
in
mind
at
the
time
that
they
conduct
the
illegal
arrest.
and
in
this
case,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
police
wanted
the
fruits
of
a
photographic
identification,
a
lineup
identification
and
an
in-court
identification,
and
common
sense
dictates,
common
sense
dictates
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
perhaps
not,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
this
is
again
the
question
of
foreseeability
and
would
go
to
the
question
of
the
police’s
intent
at
the
time
they
committed
the
illegal
arrest.
if
they
in
fact
have
the
scenario
in
mind
that
your
honor
just
described,
then
yes,
again
the
exclusionary
ought
to
bar
that,
as
the
fourth
amendment
in
fact
does,
ought
to
bar
unlawful
arrest.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
and
let
me
give
another
example
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
only
in
this
sense
would
is
say
that
it
should
be
excluded,
your
honor
and
that’s
if
the
police
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
if
it’s
a
situation
where
the
police
are
in
fact
creating
a
situation
as
your
honor
described,
then
i
think
the
exclusionary
rule
ought
to
bar
that.
if
they
are
setting
up
any
illegal
arrest
and
to
get
one
identification
and
they
have
in
mind
later
on
a
trial
introducing
yet
a
second
identification,
then
we
submit
again
common
sense
says
that
that
is
a
fruit,
in
a
traditional
sense
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
in
this
sense,
your
honor,
of
question
of
what
is
foreseeable
at
the
time
that
the
police
committed
the
illegality,
did
they
have
in
mind
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
and
my
answer
in
response,
answer
to
the
court
is
simply
that
if
the
police
had
that
in
mind,
if
they
had
the
idea
of
a
subterfuge,
that
we
will
illegally
arrest
the
defendant
have
him
seen
at
the
police
station
by
witness
a
so
that
they
will
have
a
basis
for
bringing
him
into
the
court
so
witness
b,
his
brother
can
then
make
identification.
then
as
we
see
it,
that
is
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
arrest.
now,
a
different
set
of
facts
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
the
case
is
that
this
court
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
no,
your
honor.
at
least
as
respondent
views
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
it
is
much,
much
more
narrow
than
that.
in
this
particular
case,
the
police
had
an
identifiable
fruit
in
mind
at
the
time
that
they
committed
the
illegal
arrest.
if
it’s
a
situation
where
they
just
illegally
arrest
somebody
and
hopes
serendipitously
that
other
evidence
will
come
to
their
attention,
we
submit
that
might
very
well
presented
a
different
type
of
case.
it
may
or
may
not
be
the
type
of
case
that
the
court
would
want
to
consider
applying
exclusionary
sanction.
another
type
of
case
that
this
court
has
decided
is
davis
versus
mississippi.
davis
was
illegally
arrested
and
his
fingerprints
were
taken
and
that
was
the
basis
for
him
being
in
the
courtroom
at
the
time
of
his
trial.
to
the
police’s
surprise,
to
the
government’s
surprise,
the
complaining
witness
in
davis
made
an
in-court
identification.
now,
we
don’t
necessarily
see
that
as
a
fruit
of
the
earlier
illegality,
because
the
police
did
not
foresee
that
particular
fruit.
but
in
this
case,
the
police
clearly
had
that
fruit
in
mind
at
the
time
that
it
committed
the
illegal
arrest.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
that’s
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
for
this
reason,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
independence
source
determination
of
the
trial
court
only
went
to
the
reliability
of
the
in-court
identification.
now,
that
is
a
fifth
amendment
doctrine
that
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment
doctrine
of
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
yes,
your
honor,
we
stand
behind
the
court
of
appeals.
certainly,
i
don’t
question
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
to
the
extent
–
yes,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
primarily
focuses
on
the
question
of
deterrence,
does
it
make
sense
in
this
particular
case?
what
kind
of
message
are
we
going
to
give
the
police
and
the
district
of
columbia
based
on
our
holding?
are
we
going
to
give
them
a
message
that
they
can
conduct
an
illegal,
flagrantly
illegal
arrest,
and
be
able
to
profit
or
benefit
from
the
fruits
or
instead
are
we
going
to
give
them
a
different
message
that
in
district
of
columbia,
at
least,
that
that
type
of
police
practice
is
improper?
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
your
honor
this
comes
down
to
the
basic
question
of
exclusionary
rule
in
the
first
place.
as
we
see
this
case,
however,
it
really
doesn’t
turn
on
the
message
in
the
sense
that
the
court
is
using
it,
as
far
as
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
yes,
your
honor.
but
what
really
is
operating
here
and
the
whole
reason
that
we’re
in
court
today
is
because
of
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
not
necessarily
the
exclusionary
rule
but
the
fourth
amendment.
it’s
the
fourth
amendment
that
tells
the
police
or
should
tell
the
police
that
when
they
have
a
general
description
to
know
more,
but
they
can’t
make
an
arrest
based
on
suspicion
and
for
the
attempt
of
trying
to
produce
evidence.
it’s
the
fourth
amendment
that
stands
as
the
bar
on
january
9,
19
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
yes,
your
honor.
as
we
see
it
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
no,
no
your
honor.
we
only
mean
producing
evidence
in
this
sense.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
an
arrest
such
as
this
based
on
photographic
identification
is
almost
inevitably
going
to
lead
to
a
lineup,
the
request
for
a
lineup
and
if
there’s
a
lineup
identification,
then
inevitably
lead
to
a
situation
where
there’ll
be
courtroom
identification.
the
police
clearly
had
all
those
three
things
in
mind
at
the
time
that
they
arrested
mr.
crews.
they
had
in
mind
all
those
fruits.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
decision
simply
says
is
that
we
have
to
exclude
all
those
fruits.
not
just
simply
one
or
two
of
them
but
all
three
of
them
or
we
will
not
be
able
to
deter
that
type
of
police
misconduct
in
the
future
in
the
district
of
columbia.
their
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
really
literally
that
simple
and
straightforward.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
this
case,
your
honor,
looking
through
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
last
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
your
honor,
this
case
stands
out
as
a
unique
case
on
its
facts,
in
the
sense
that
the,
as
to
the
degree
of
the
flagrancy
and
the
bad
faith
of
the
police
misconduct
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
why
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
felt
and
incumbent
to
decide
the
case
the
way
they
did,
because
it
really
is
out
of
the
mainstream.
the
police
misconduct
here
is
much,
much
more
severe
than
the
usually
the
typical
police
practice
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
we
submit
that
it’s
on
a
parallel.
it
certainly
with
the
conduct
in
brown.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
facts
on
this
case
do
stand
out
as
particularly
obnoxious
form
of
police
misconduct.
again,
they
had
nothing
more
than
the
most
general
of
description,
your
honors,
that
would
describe
thousands,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
youths
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
but
still,
it
is
in
a
public
place.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
the
guide
at
best
that
he
thought
the
respondent
might
have
been
at
the
monument
six
days
ago
(voice
overlap)
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
that’s
right.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
no.
we
think
of
this
case
in
the
decision
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
side
by
side
with
frisbie
and
the
ker
doctrine
and
we
had
anticipated
the
government’s
grand
jury
argument
as
well.
we’re
not
attacking
as
in
collander
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
nor
does
this
case
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
that’s
correct.
now,
however,
if
the
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
if
the
police
had
independent
probable
cause,
independent
from
this
illegal
arrest,
then
they
could
bring
the
companioning
witness
to
adduce
an
in-court
identification.
if
the
police
in
this
case
or
the
government
in
this
case
had
independent
basis
for
the
prosecution
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
we
submit
that
that
would
be
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
arrest
if
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
police.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
that
in
effect
is
what
happened
in
this
particular
case,
because
the
out-of-court
identifications
were
excluded
and
the
government
was
able,
however
to
introduce
the
in-court
identification.
and
the
police,
upon
seeing
that
a
conviction
results
in
this
facts
and
an
in-court
identification
can
still
come
in,
notwithstanding
the
flagrant
misconduct.
we
submit
again
the
message
to
the
police
is
very
clear.
you
can
go
out,
if
particularly
if
you
can’t
solve
an
offense
otherwise,
you
can
go
out
and
arrest
whoever
you
want
and
get
him
into
a
courtroom
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
we
submit
that
that,
again
as
the
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
in
those
situations
the,
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
there
are
mixed
reasons
for
suppressing
the
lineup
identification.
in
part
you
want
to
deter
the
government
from
having
counsel-less
lineups
for
instance,
or
unduly
suggestive
lineups
and
therefore
you
might
exclude
the
lineup.
but
it
would
be
taken
--
it
would
accomplish
too
much
in
those
situations
needlessly
to
also
exclude
reliable
evidence
at
trial.
we
know
that
the
fourth
amendment,
however,
contemplates
in
certain
circumstances
because
this
court
said
so
in
davis
versus
mississippi,
excluding
even
reliable
evidence
at
trial,
and
that’s
why
we
submit
that
the
independent
source
finding
of
the
trial
judge
here
does
not
preclude
or
stand
in
the
way
of
the
court
of
appeals
finding
that
this
in-court
identification
as
surely
as
the
lineup
and
as
surely
as
the
photographic
identification,
were
indeed
intended
fruits
of
this
particular
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
i
would
certainly
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
respondent
certainly
agrees
that
that
is
a
case
as
well
that
might
call
for
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
easiest
case
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
the
easiest
case
for
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
or
if
it
makes
any
sense
at
all
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule,
we
submit,
is
in
a
situation
where
you
have
flagrant,
deliberate
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
you
have
a
specific
purpose.
the
police
have
a
specific
purpose
of
the
time
they
committed
the
illegality.
now,
it
may
very
well
be,
as
your
honors
positive,
if
the
specific
purpose
is
just
a
hold
to
the
defendant
until
the
evidence
turns
out
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
that,
we
think
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
we
submit
that
that
[voice
overlap]
would
radically
change
the
facts
in
this
case.
it
is
because
the
trial
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
deliberate
violation
and
found
a
flagrant
violation,
and
found
a
purposeful
violation
that
we
submit
that
this
case
does
call
for
--
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
in
frisbie,
the
police
already
had,
the
government
already
had
probable
cause
and
frankly,
except
for
notions
of
federalism,
the
idea
that
the
police
can
go
into
a
neighboring
state
and
bring
somebody
back
when
they
already
have
probable
cause,
when
they
have
the
basis
for
a
prosecution,
is
not
that
shocking
to
a
respondent.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
well,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
frisbie
and
in
ker,
it
could
very
well
be
that
congress
itself
would
want
to
create
remedies
or
sanctions
against
the
municipalities
or
government
that
actually
did
that.
but
as
far
as
fourth
amendment
law
goes,
again,
the
defendants
on
those
cases,
the
government
did
have
a
prosecution,
did
have
probable
cause
and
the
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
exactly
why
the
exclusionary
rule
needs
to
be
applied
in
this
particular
case
because
here
the
government,
the
police
had
nothing.
they
had
no
way
of
solving
this
particular
offense
unless
they
committed
the
illegal
arrest
and
they
knew
that.
they
clearly
knew
that.
mr.
w.
gary
kohlman
in
both
senses,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
this
was
a
deliberate
fourth
amendment
violation
in
the
sense
that
the
police
knew
that
they
did
not
have
probable
cause
but
committed
the
arrest
anyway.
it
was
also
purposeful
in
the
sense
that
they
had
an
object
in
mind,
a
specific
fruit
in
mind
and
that
is
identification
testimony.
so
in
both
sense,
the
illegal
arrest
was
exactly
what
this
court
found
in
brown
versus
illinois.
a
situation
where
the
police
committed
a
flagrantly
improper
arrest
and
they
had
a
deliberate
goal
in
brown
in
my
mind
as
well,
a
fruit
in
brown
and
that
is
the
confession.
and
in
a
situation
where
you
can
see
what
the
police
are
doing
or
why
they
are
doing
it.
we
submit
that
that
is
a
classic
situation
where
the
exclusionary
rule
needs
to
be
applied.
now,
as
far
as
the
question
of
frisbie
goes
and
as
far
as
the
question
of
the
grand
jury
goes,
we
are
not
challenging,
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
clear
that
we
are
not
challenging
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
try
this
particular
case
and
if
the
government
had
independent
evidence
they
could
have
elicited
the
in-court
identification
or
if
they
have
other
evidence
they
could
have
convicted
the
respondent
in
the
case
but
they
did
not.
as
it
turns
out
in
this
particular
case,
the
only
evidence
the
government
did
have
was
the
in-court
identification.
the
very
fruit
that
the
police
had
in
mind
at
the
time
of
the
illegal
arrest
was
made.
as
we
see
this
case,
the
decision
of
this
court
makes
will
really
be
very
similar
to
the
decision
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
in
--
when
they
faced
these
facts
and
that
again
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
to
sanction
police
misconduct
in
the
situation
where
they
deliberately
overstepped
the
line
with
a
specific
fruit
in
mind.
and
if
this
court
upholds
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
we
think
again
the
message
will
be
as
clear
as
this
court
has
made
it
in
brown
versus
illinois
and
dunaway
versus
new
york,
and
that
is
that
the
police
cannot
overstep
the
fourth
amendment
with
a
specific
purpose
in
mind,
and
if
they
do
so,
that
that
fruit
cannot
be
used.
there
are
no
further
questions?
