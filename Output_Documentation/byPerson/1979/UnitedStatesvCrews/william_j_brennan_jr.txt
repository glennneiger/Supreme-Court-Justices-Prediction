justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
respondent
was
tried
and
convicted
in
the
district
of
columbia
superior
court
under
an
indictment
charging
assault
and
robbery.
he
sought
before
trial
to
suppress
all
identification
testimony
because
as
the
government
concedes,
he
had
been
illegally
arrested
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress.
under
the
doctrine
of
frisbie
v.
collins,
the
illegality
of
his
arrest
did
not
of
course
preclude
his
trial
and
conviction.
that
illegality
did
however
present
the
question
whether
the
victim's
in-court
identification
of
respondent
as
her
assailant
should
be
excluded
as
the
fruit
of
the
respondent's
unlawful
arrest.
the
trial
court
held
that
the
illegality
of
the
arrest
had
not
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
tainted
the
victim's
in
court
identification
and
permitted
the
victim
to
testify
that
respondent
was
her
assailant.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
in-court
identification
evidence
was
obtained
by
official
exploitation
of
the
primary
illegality
that
is
the
wrongful
arrest
within
the
meaning
of
wong
sun
v.
united
states
and
should
therefore
have
been
excluded.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
reversed.
the
trial
court
expressly
found
that
the
victim's
court
identification
rested
on
an
independent
recollection
of
her
initial
encounter
with
the
assailant
that
is
on
events
that
occurred
before
respondent's
arrest.
and
this
determination
finds
ample
support
in
the
record.
at
the
scene
of
the
assault
and
robbery,
the
victim
viewed
her
assailant
at
close
range
for
a
period
of
from
5
to
10
minutes
under
excellent
lighting
conditions
with
no
distractions,
respondent
closely
matched
the
description
given
by
the
victim
immediately
after
the
robbery.
the
victim
failed
to
identify
anyone
other
than
respondent
indeed
twice
selected
respondent
without
hesitation
in
non-suggestive
pretrial
identification
procedures
and
only
a
week
had
passed
between
the
victim's
initial
observation
of
respondent
and
her
first
identification
of
him.
in
short,
the
victim's
capacity
to
identify
her
assailant
in
court
antedated
respondent's
arrest
and
neither
resulted
from
nor
was
biased
by
the
unlawful
police
conduct
committed
after
she
had
developed
that
capacity.
mr.
justice
white
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
each
filed
a
separate
opinion
joining
in
the
reversal
but
addressing
a
question
not
addressed
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
stevens
and
me
namely,
whether
notwithstanding
frisbie
and
collins,
there
may
be
circumstances
though
not
present
in
this
case
in
which
an
accused
physiognomy
should
be
considered
evidence
in
a
possible
fruit
of
police
misconduct.
mr.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
