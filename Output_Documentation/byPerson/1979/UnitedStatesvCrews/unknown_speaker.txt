unknown
speaker
isn’t
it
in
logic,
my
brother
white’s
suggestion
inevitable?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
suppose
you
have
an
arrest
and
a
lineup,
and
the
person
is
identified
and
he
is
then,
a
charge
is
filed
against
him
or
he
is
indicted
and
the
same
person
who
identified
him
in
the
lineup
is
going
to
testify
in
court?
well
--
so
as
it
turns
out,
the
lineup
was
invalid,
there
was
only
one
person
in
the
lineup
or
something,
just
invalid.
what
determines
whether
the,
and
let’s
assume
that
that’s
the
only
reason
for
the
arrest
was
the
lineup,
was
for
the
continued
custody
was
the
lineup.
otherwise,
they’d
turn
him
lose.
unknown
speaker
whatever
it
is,
whatever
those
grounds
are
mr.
frey.
they’re
--
the
lineup
was
bad
and
if
they
hadn’t
been
an
identification
at
the
lineup,
they
would
have
turned
him
lose.
now,
certainly
the
--
certainly
the
identification
in
the
courtroom
isn’t
necessarily
barred?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
is
some
independent
basis
for
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
any
different
from
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
this
take
this
case
would
be
for
certiorari
from
onset
cases.
suppose
the
arrest,
suppose
the
arrest
is
the
so-called
probable
cause
is
based
solely
on
an
illegal
show-up
and
anyone
would
agree
that
this
is
a
--
that
the
arrest
is
invalid.
unknown
speaker
the
arrest
is
invalid,
they
never
let
us
put
him
on
trial,
and
he
is
identified
in
the
courtroom.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
had
already
decided
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
frey
isn’t
this
is
a
different
case?
isn’t
this
is
a
case
where
the
witness
has
independent,
reliable
basis
for
her
in-court
in
the
identification?
unknown
speaker
right.
and
i
would
say
that
in
my
example
that
the
person
has
independent
basis
for
the
identification,
the
testimony
comes
in,
it
doesn’t
exclude
it,
and
--
why
is
that
--
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
in
the
present
posture
of
this
case,
mr.
frey,
you
necessarily
conceded
arguendo
that
there
had
been
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
unknown
speaker
i’m
correct
in
that
understanding,
am
i?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
i’d
be
interested
in
knowing
whether
you
think
the
flagrancy
or
lack
thereof
the
fourth
amendment
violation
is
a
proper
consideration
in
attenuation
analysis?
unknown
speaker
you
do.
unknown
speaker
if
you
don’t
take
attenuation
just
a
matter
of
cause
and
effect
but
it’s
kind
of
a
balancing
act?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
their
support
for
the
view.
i
just
think
it’s
a
correct
approach.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
have
a
different
case
if
she
had
seen
him
walking
down
the
street
and
went
to
a
policeman
and
said,
“that’s
the
man.”
unknown
speaker
an
accidental
encounter
of
that
kind?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the
police
have
illegally
arrested,
as
they
did
in
this
case
to
the
station
house,
and
they
bring
a
witness
down
to
identify,
he’s
identified
and
he
goes
on
trial,
and
they
don’t
use
that
particular
witness,
they
use
another
witness,
another
victim,
this
particular
victim,
say.
and
would
say
that
that
testimony
has
to
be
excluded
because
of
the
illegal
arrest
and
the
illegal
pre-trial
identification?
unknown
speaker
you’re
just
saying
that
once
if
you
--
really,
if
you
deliberately
arrest
somebody
unlawfully
you
shouldn’t
be
able
to
try
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
if
you
would
exclude
this
testimony
of
the
second
witness.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
is
the
only
evidence
they
had?
unknown
speaker
if
“fruit”
in
the
sense
that
the
--
not
in
the
sense
that
the
in-court
identification
is
the
product
of
a
pre-trial
identification?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose,
let’s
just
suppose
that
the
witness
they
use
is
the
brother,
the
victim
was
a
brother
of
the
defendant,
and
everybody
knows
that
a
brother
knows
a
brother,
and
they
want
to
use
his
testimony
in
the
court,
and
there’s
no
question
that
there’s
an
independent
basis
for
it.
unknown
speaker
it
couldn’t
be
the
fruit
of
any
pre-trial
illegality.
the
only
sense
it’s
a
fruit
is
that
is
in
the
sense
that
the
fellow’s
in
the
courtroom
and
he
is
therefore
subject
to
identification,
where
otherwise
he
might
not
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
say,
suppose
they
say,
“well,
let’s
just
arrest
illegally,
we
really
believe
he
committed
this
crime
but
we
don’t
have
probable
cause,
but
we’ll
arrest
him
and
we’ll
get
the
evidence.”
and
they
do,
and
they
put
him
on
trial.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
he
should
--
the
conviction
should
be
set
aside
because
of
the
bad
intentions,
which
i
think
are
not
very
desirable
either,
but
is
the
conviction
vulnerable?
unknown
speaker
or
the
--
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
has
never
been
an
–
that’s
never
been
a
basis
for
the
exclusionary
rule.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
let’s
suppose
an
illegal
arrest
and
a
perfectly
good
lineup
and
a
perfect
good
identification.
i
mean,
the
lineup
is
perfectly
good
in
every
way
except
that
it
just
happens
to
have
come
about
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
arrest.
then
a
trial
and
this
identifying
witness
who
has
independent
grounds
for
identification
is
going
to
testify
and
the
government
also
wants
to
introduce
the
testimony
of
the
out-of-court
identification.
is
either
one
--
is
the
out-of-court
identification
admissible?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that’s
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
arrest?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
isn’t
the
in-court
identification
approved?
unknown
speaker
let
me
crack
in
that
there
is
no
other
evidence,
no
independent
evidence
of
probable
cause.
it’s
just
that
lineup
and
then
there
is
a
trial
and
the
only
evidence
in
the
trial
is
that
identification.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
prosecution
wants
to
introduce
at
the
trial
evidence
of
both
the
out-of-court
identification
and
the
in-court
identification.
i
think
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
in-court
identification,
if
it
were
found
not
to
be
a
fruit
of
the
out-of-court
identification
would
be
admissible.
unknown
speaker
no,
it’s
independent.
let’s
say
everybody
agrees
that
it
is
independent.
unknown
speaker
why
would
that
be
a
fruit?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
trial
is
--
unknown
speaker
trial
is
as
a
result
of
an
official
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
crucial
question
at
the
trial
is,
“do
you
see
the
man
who
attacked
you
in
the
courtroom?”
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
do,
and
so
it’s
the
identification
that’s
the
fruit
--
