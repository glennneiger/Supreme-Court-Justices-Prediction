and
it
is
a
little
unusual
for
someone
to
keep
coming
back
to
the
same
area
day
after
day,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
let’s
just
suppose
that
this
arrest
have
been
made
without
probable
cause,
it’s
an
illegal
arrest,
there
never
was
a
lineup,
they
just
put
the
person
on
trial
and
they
called
this
complaining
witness,
and
she
identified
him
in
the
courtroom.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
just
arrested
him
and
their
purpose
was
to
put
him
on
trial
and
they
thought
somebody
could
identify
him,
and
they
got
somebody
to
identify
him.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

acting
in
a
purposeful
manner,
do
you
mean
that
they
knew
that
they
are
violating
the
fourth
amendment
or
that
they
intended
to
find
out
if
this
man
was
the
one
who
perpetrated
the
crime?
