justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
makes
no
difference
to
your
argument,
then,
that
the
trial
court
here
concluded
that
he
would
exclude
the
photographic
identification,
but
that
there
was
an
independent
satisfactory
basis
for
the
in-court
identification.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
entirely
consistent
internally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
you
stand
behind
it
but
do
you
think
it’s
internally
consistent
throughout?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
kind
of
message
are
we
going
to
give
robbers
at
the
washington
monument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
used
the
term
“message,”
i
didn’t.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
think
they
would
deter
it
because
no
one
would
ever
be
arrested?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nobody
would
ever
be
tried.
