mr.
kohlman,
didn’t
they
have
that
guide
who
was
located
there
who
thought
he
looked
like
a
friend
of
his
or
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that’s
a
little
bit
more
than
just
one
out
of
a
hundred
thousand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
like
a
friend
of
his
whom
he
gave
him
some
reason
to
identify
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seemed
to
me
that
your
argument
would
lead
logically
and
maybe
you’re
right
to
overruling
frisbie?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
police
conduct
there,
i
think,
is
probably
more
egregious
than
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
would
you
say
this
is
the
same
case
as
if,
apart
from
the
illegality
here,
they
had
probable
cause
to
bring
into
trial?
you’d
still
say
her
testimony
should
be
suppressed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
do
you
get
around
frisbie?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
illegal
lineup
cases
where
the
identifying
witness
in
an
illegal
lineup
is
still
permitted
to
testify
at
trial
although
evidence
of
is
out-of-court
identification
is
excluded?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
message
to
the
police
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what’s
your
--
what’s
the
message
to
the
police
if
they
illegally
arrest
and
say,
“well,
we’ll
get
the
evidence,”
and
they
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
suppose
you
would
argue
that
they
shouldn’t
be
able
to
try
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
wouldn’t
be
here
if
those
officers
had
just
been
mistaken,
but
they
had
acted
in
good
faith?
