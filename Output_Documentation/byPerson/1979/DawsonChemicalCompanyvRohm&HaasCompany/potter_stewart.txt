do
i
correctly
understand
that
you,
in
effect,
agree
that
you
are
a
contributory
infringer,
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
misuse?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
only
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
were
his
earlier
statements
directed
to
the
same
statutory
language?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
did
involve
contributory
infringement?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
convertible
top.
justice
potter
stewart
the
distinction
between
staple
and
non-staple
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
contributory
infringement,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it
is
staple,
you
won't
have
contributory
infringement.
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
it
not
true
that
you
may
have
misuse
whether
you
have
a
staple
or
non-staple.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
particular
case
where
we
have
a
non-staple,
supposing
instead
of
just
making
periodic
sales
of
implied
license
to
the
user
you
entered
into
a
long-term,
say
a
ten-year
license
with
a
farmer,
giving
him
the
right
to
use
your
patent
for
ten
years.
and
you
said
as
a
condition
of
that
license
you
may
only
use
with
propanil
purchased
from
us.
would
that
be
misuse?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
assuming
that
it
is
known
in
advance
that
propanil
will
continue
to
be
a
non-staple
for
ten
years?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
an
implied
license?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand.
but
for
purposes
of
trying
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
misuse
--
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
--
you
are
saying
the
case
would
be
the
same
on
a
misuse
issue
if
there
were
an
express
license
and
if
the
express
license
were
conditioned
on
the
purchase
of
an
unpatented
product
from
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
the
whole
issue
in
the
case,
because
271
they
concede
there
is
contributory
infringement.
justice
potter
stewart
and
nothing
in
271
expressly
covers
the
kind
of
case
we
are
talking
about,
so
the
question
really
is
whether
this
is
a
misuse
when
it
is
a
non-staple
item.
and
i
don't
think
it
has
been
decided
before,
as
far
i
can
see.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
none
of
those
three
shall
create
a
misuse.
it
doesn't
mean
that
if
you
do
those
three
you
are
exempted
from
something
else
which
would
constitute
a
misuse.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
whether
the
something
else,
namely
granting
a
license
on
condition
that
you
buy
only
the
product,
is
a
misuse.
that
is
the
question,
and
that
isn't
discussed
here.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
things
besides
those
three
things
in
(d)?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
aren't
you
still
telling
farmers
don't
use
our
patent
except
in
connection
with
our
propanil?
justice
potter
stewart
once
other
uses
for
propanil
are
found,
then
anybody
could
freely
sell
propanil
without
being
a
contributor
or
infringer.
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
this
method
patented.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
a
component
of
the
combination
it
was
patentable.
justice
potter
stewart
not
an
exact
analogy.
