justice
john
paul

suppose
the
invention
requires
the
use
of
a
non-staple
material
and
you
say
the
patentee
has
a
right
to
his
invention.
does
he
have
the
right
to
license
the
invention
even
though
he
uses
a
non-staple
material?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
he
have
a
right
to
refuse
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
can
you
work
it
both
ways?
does
that
apply
to
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that
is
what
it
sounds
to
me
like.
i
mean
in
a
way,
it
sounds
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
your
client
asked
them
for
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
your
client
ever
asked
them
for
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
said,
no,
we
won't
give
you
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
take
one
if
they
said,
yes,
we
will
give
you
a
license;
but,
for
a
small
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
pay
a
reasonable
royalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
think
that
they
must
grant
you
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
you
have
the
right
to
sell
it
without
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
refused
to
license
you,
you
claim
you
can
sell
without
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
in
suing
you
they
said
we
offered
them
a
license
and
they
refused?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
client
a
license.
suppose
they
said,
this
suit
is
because
we
have
this
patented
process
using
a
non-staple
material
we
offered
a
license
to
xyz
and
they
refused
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
saying
that
the
patentee
must
give
you
a
license.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
he
give
the
farmer
an
alternative?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
could
end
up,
i
suppose,
theoretically
at
least,
that
you
lose
but
the
other
side
loses,
too,
in
a
sense
that
they
have
to
give
you
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
you
would
both
win?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
they
have
to
do
is
offer
you
a
license
at
a
reasonable
royalty
and
if
you
refuse
it,
you
are
in
trouble?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
involved
in
practicing
their
invention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
exactly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
suggesting
it
is
possible
that
even
if
propanil
was
a
staple
that
you
could
prevent
people
from
selling
it
if
the
purpose
of
the
sale
was
to
use
your
invention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
rather
than
trying
to
monopolize
the
sale
of
a
staple
generally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
teaching
of
the
briefs
was
that
we
learned
from
271
that
congress
wanted
to
draw
a
very
clear
bright
line
between
staples
and
non-staples.
you
say
that
is
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
none
of
those
should
constitute
misuse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
not
say,
though,
that
a
long-term
license
on
condition
is
not
a
misuse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
said,
i
think,
is
if
you
do
anyone
of
those
three
things
you
are
not
guilty
of
misuse.
and
that
is
a
little
different
from
saying
that
none
of
those
three
things
constitute
misuse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
and
that
is
what
the
statute
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
the
patentee
is
doing
here,
he
is
offering
for
sale
propanil,
which
271
says
he
can
certainly
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
doesn't
need
to
go
out
and
practice
his
invention
himself,
he
is
selling
propanil.
he
is
doing
something
that
if
somebody
else
does
it
is
contributory
infringement,
which
is
what
271
says
he
can
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
all
he
is
doing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
haven't
told
me
yet
where
he
is
conditioning
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
refuses
to
grant
a
license
without
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whom
has
he
refused?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
really
are
saying
that
his
real
sin
is
refusing
you
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
is
that?
