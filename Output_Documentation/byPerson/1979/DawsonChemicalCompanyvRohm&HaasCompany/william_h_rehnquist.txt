justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
conley,
if
you
will
notice
the
last
page
of
judge
gee's
opinion
in
the
fifth
circuit
at
page
a-48
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
he
quotes
judge
richards,
saying
that
--
i
think
he
says
himself
these
are
the
kinds
of
cases
that
are
argued
by
professionals
to
amateurs.
and
so
you
may
take
my
question
in
that
light.
is
it
fair
to
say
that
both
the
doctrines
of
contributory
infringement
and
patent
misuse
are
to
a
certain
extent
the
obverse
sides
of
the
same
coin,
neither
of
them
are
the
substance
of
the
patent
or
what
can
be
patented?
one
is
trying
to
expand
what
is
patentable
and
the
other
is
enabling
the
patentee
to
police
the
patent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
particularly
true
in
combination
patents,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
a
staple
or
a
non-staple?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
they
conjunctive
or
disjunctive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
question
is
whether
the
doctrine
of
contributory
infringement
has
been
reintroduced
and
mercoid,
in
effect,
either
sharply
cut
back
on
or
overruled
by
the
congressional
act,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
have
no
bargaining
power
under
your
theory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
have
no
bargaining
power
with
the
farmers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
propanil
have
any
use
except
in
this
combination
patent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
were
some
other
statements,
too,
made
by
senator
mccarren
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
saying
that
there
were
some
changes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
aro
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
disagree
with
judge
gee's
analysis
of
those
two
cases
and
references
to
mercoid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
how
about
the
more
detailed
analysis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
take
it,
you
know,
you
have
read
his
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
devoted
three
or
four
pages
of
his
opinion
to
the
analysis
of
aro
1
and
aro
2
as
he
called
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
contend
that
your
sales
of
propanil
are
to
the
ultimate
consumer
of
the
product?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
dispute
over
that
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hutz,
don't
opponents
of
legislation
have
a
history
of
a
parade
of
horribles
saying
how
bad
this
is
going
to
be
when
perhaps
the
actual
enacted
language
does
not
involve
all
the
things
they
think
it
does?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
'52
act
of
congress,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
his
refusal
to
grant
a
license.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
talking
about
all
the
cases
that
came
before.
i
am
talking
about
the
'52
act
of
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
patent
misuse
stems
from
mercoid
and
the
question
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
from
catlin
v.
leeds
and
so
forth,
but
it
reached
its
apogee
in
mercoid.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
'52
congressional
enactment
was
intended
to
either
overrule
or
limit
mercoid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
call
it
clarify
but
certainly
there
wouldn't
have
been
that
legislation
had
it
not
been
for
mercoid
and
its
predecessors.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mercoid
left
very
much
in
doubt
whether
there
was
anything
left
of
the
doctrine
of
contributory
infringement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
those
were
scope
of
patent
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
contributory
infringement
and
patent
misuse
are
both
how
you
remedy-type
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
no
question
that
congress
--
accepting
the
commerce
clause
definition
of
wickard
v.
filburn,
congress
needn't
rely
on
the
patent
clause
to
grant
everybody
that
comes
up
with
an
invention
a
patent
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
question
of
which
authority
congress
might
have
been
acting
under,
just
like
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
was
it
the
enforcement
provisions
of
amendment
14
or
was
it
the
commerce
power?
some
said
one,
some
said
the
other.
i
think
this
court
said
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
