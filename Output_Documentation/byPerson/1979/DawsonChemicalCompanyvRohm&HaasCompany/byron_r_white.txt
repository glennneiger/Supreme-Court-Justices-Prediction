why
is
your
client
willing
to
take
a
license
from
the
patentee
and
pay
him
some
royalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
misuse
that
you
talk
about
is
at
least
in
part
the
fact
that
they
refused
to
give
you
a
license
when
you
offered
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
to
avoid
the
misuse,
quit
coercing
the
farmer
and
also
give
you
a
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
basis
for
the
claim
that
you
are
letting
people
practice
your
patent
but
only
on
condition
that
they
buy
an
unpatented
material
from
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
not
then
talking
about
tributary
infringement;
and
is
it
not
true
even
if
it
were
feasible
--
and
i
understand
it
is
probably
not
--
to
license
farmers,
about
3,000
licenses
to
farmers,
so
there
would
be
no
claim
whatsoever
that
you
are
misusing
the
patent,
then
you
could
still
sue
these
people
for
contributory
infringement
under
this
bill.
and
the
justice
department
didn't
want
you
to
even
be
able
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
am
i
not
correct
in
what
i
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there
were
no
basis
for
a
claim
of
misuse
here
and,
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
whether
that
is
a
valid
basis,
say
you
had
a
licensing
program
and
you
just
licensed
the
farmers.
and
your
competitor
sold
the
product
to
those
farmers,
knowing
it
had
no
other
use.
you
would
then
clearly
be
able
to
hold
them
liable
as
a
contributory
infringer
and
they
would
have
no
misuse
defense.
and
the
justice
department
didn't
want
you
even
to
be
able
to
hold
them
liable
in
those
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
their
opposition
to
the
bill
didn't
necessarily
address
itself
specifically
to
the
misuse
question.
it
addressed
itself
to
the
contributory
infringement.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
just
ask,
you
agree
with
respondents
generally.
do
you
specifically
agree
with
the
view
that
a
long-term
license
of
a
non-staple
on
condition
that
the
product
be
bought
exclusively
from
the
patentee
is
not
a
misuse?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
mean
that
the
patent
becomes
substantially
worthless
if
the
product
ceases
to
be
a
non-staple?
say
somebody
discovers
another
use
for
propanil,
then
is
the
patent
no
longer
of
value?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
just
explained
that
you
really
as
a
practical
matter
could
not
enforce
it,
except
by
controlling
the
sales?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
infringers
as
soon
as
the
product
ceases
being
a
non-staple.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
this
were
salt
or
sugar?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
again,
where
would
the
condition
--
how
did
the
patentee
here
attempt
to
impose
any
condition
that
the
use
of
his
patent
must
be
--
it
is
conditioned
on
buying
propanil
from
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
didn't
say
it
anywhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
sells
propanil.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
what
271
says
he
can
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
doesn't
tell
them
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
doesn't
tell
them
anything

justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
say
to
the
farmer,
you
can't
buy
that
from
anybody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
he
really
does
is
he
won't
furnish
you
a
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
won't
furnish
you
one,
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
there
is
a
just
not
fourth
paragraph
in
(d).
justice
byron
r.
white
that
says
you
may
condition
the
use
of
your
invention
on
the
purchase
of
a
non-staple
material.
justice
byron

which
you
say
is
what
is
happening
here
and
which
is
outside
the
protection
of
(d).
