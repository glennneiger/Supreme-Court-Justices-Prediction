mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
fundamental
question
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
language
of
the
1952
patent
act
and,
in
particular,
section
271
approves
of
rohm
and
haas'
conduct
in
this
action.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
lengthy,
detailed
and,
i
think,
scholarly
analysis
unanimously
held
that
section
271
did
in
fact
approve
of
rohm
and
haas'
conduct.
and
we
submit,
needless
to
say,
that
that
decision
is
entirely
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
and
i
think
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
mentioned,
that
basically
what
we
have
involved
here
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
also
recognized,
we
have
a
clash
between
two
principles.
we
have
the
principle
of
the
patent
laws
which
attempts
to
stimulate
innovation
and
protect
inventions
on
the
one
hand.
and
we
have
a
clash
with
the
concepts
of
the
patent
misuse
doctrine
on
the
other.
and
in
principle
those
two
concepts
are
antagonistic
and
logically
they
cannot
coexist
one
with
the
other.
that
conflict
is
precisely
what
was
presented
to
congress
when
it
debated
whether
or
not
to
pass
what
is
now
section
271.
the
mercoid
decision
had
drawn
the
line
with
respect
to
that
conflict
and
it
had
drawn
that
line
on
the
side
of
misuse
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
the
law
of
patents.
and
for
the
next
four
years
people
attempted
to
draft
an
act
that
would
move
that
line
to
more
of
a
middle
road
position
and
for
the
next
four
years
through
three
separate
hearings,
many
debates,
congress
attempted
to
draw
that
line
in
a
manner
consistent
with
public
policy
as
congress
perceived
it.
prior
to
section
271
it
of
course
had
been
the
courts
that
had
drawn
the
line
and
now
it
was
time
for
congress
if
you
will,
to
try
its
hand
at
drawing
that
line.
congress
determined
public
policy
and
it
drew
that
line
dependent
upon
the
distinction
between
staple
and
non-staple
articles.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
yes,
your
honor,
if
it
is
a
non-staple
as
we
are
using
the
term
now
it
is
considered
to
be
contributory
infringement?
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
you
will
not
have
contributory
infringement,
you
may
have
active
inducement.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
perfectly
possible.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
it
could
well
be
a
misuse
in
the
sense
that
the
extent
of
the
license
may
continue
beyond
the
point
at
which
propanil
is
a
non-staple.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
i
am
not
sure
how
you
know
that
in
advance
but
the
question
--
if
your
question
basically
is
could
we
do
it
by
an
expressed
license
the
--
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
--
effectively
the
equivalent
of
what
is
done
now
--
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
--
i
would
say
that
was
not
a
misuse.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
what
we
are
doing
now
is
we
are
granting
no
licenses,
as
i
think
is
clear.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
well,
it
is
called
an
implied
license,
it
is
actually
--
it
goes
back
to
an
exhaustion
of
the
monopoly
we
sell
the
product
propanil,
that
is
all
we
do.
we
do
not
issue
any
written
licenses,
we
don't
state
there
is
a
license
on
our
label.
as
a
matter
of
law,
when
we
have
sold
that
propanil
we
are
no
longer
able
to
exercise
any
control
over
it,
because
it
has
--
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
if
the
express
license
was
the
equivalent
of
what
we
are
doing
here
i
would
say
there
is
no
misuse.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
once
you
begin
to
talk
about
a
long-term
and
other
factors
there
may
be
something
in
addition
--
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
your
honor,
i
would
take
issue
with
your
statement,
because
i
believe
that
section
271
does
expressly
approve
of
what
we
are
doing,
because
it
expressly
states
there
shall
--
i
am
talking
about
271(d)
now.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
it
expressly
states
that
there
shall
be
no
extension
--
illegal
extension
of
the
monopoly
and
no
misuse
if
the
patentee
engages
in
three
specified
acts.
it
can
be
any
one,
two
or
three
--
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
that
is
correct.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
in
this
particular
case
that
we
have
before
the
court
the
only
acts
that
rohm
and
haas
is
doing
--
are
doing
is
exactly
what
is
spelled
out
in
section
271(d).
271(d)
(1)
says
"derive
revenue
from
acts
which
are
performed
by
another
without
his
consent
would
constitute
contributory
infringement."
we
do
that,
we
sell
propanil.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
my
worthy
opponent
has
conceded
that
if
we
were
to
do
it
and
not
be
the
patent
owner
we
would
contributorily
infringe.
so
we
have
done
that
act.
the
second
thing
that
we
have
done
is
we
have
sought
--
which
is
(d)
(3)
--
we
have
sought
to
enforce
the
patent
right
against
infringement
or
contributory
infringement.
we
brought
this
suit.
we
are
of
course
able
under
section
271(d)
(2)
to
license
or
authorize
--
says
you
can
license
or
authorize
--
and
we
have
authorized
in
the
sense
that
the
law
implies
a
license,
or
more
specifically,
says
the
remedy
is
exhausted
at
the
time
that
we
sell.
now,
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
note,
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
said,
that
the
act
says
one
or
more
of
the
following.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
it
can
be
(1),
(2)
or
(3).
there
is
nothing
is
section
271
that
suggests
that
in
order
to
sell
under
(d)
(1)
we
must
license
under
(d)
(2)
and
yet
that
is
precisely
that
the
petitioner's
position
is
here.
they
are
saying
if
you
want
to
take
care,
if
you
want
to
carry
out
the
act
specifically
provided,
namely
deriving
revenue
from
acts
which
are
performed
by
another,
you
must
license.
that
is
basically
what
they
--
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
i
would
suggest
that
we
are
not.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
effectively
we
are
saying
nothing
to
the
farmers,
mr.
justice.
we
are
selling
the
propanil
and
those
that
obtain
the
propanil
through
us,
the
monopoly,
if
you
will,
has
been
exhausted
as
far
as
that
sale
is
concerned.
the
other
thing
that
we
are
doing
is
we
are
exercising
a
right
which
i
feel
that
we
have,
section
154
indicates
that
we
are,
and
that
is
we
are
not
licensing
expressly
anyone.
we
have
the
right
to
refuse
that,
we
have
always
had
the
right
to
refuse
that.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
well,
that
of
course
is
the
position
which
my
worthy
opponent
makes.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
are
selling
the
propanil,
exhausting
the
monopoly
as
to
that
product.
and
then
if
we
are
asked
whether
or
not
we
will
grant
express
licenses,
we
are
of
course
at
this
time
saying
that
we
wish
to
exercise
the
optional
right
given
to
us
under
271(d)
(2),
we
license
or
authorize
or
not.
and
i
would
submit
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
argument
which
petitioner
is
making
in
this
case
and
congress
recognized
that
the
effect
of
this
would
be
an
extension
of
the
patent
grant.
and
so
congress
specifically
stated
that
it
will
not
be
an
illegal
extension
of
the
patent
grant
if
one
does
any
(1),
(2)
or
(3)
of
these
acts.
now,
the
ability
to
carry
out
the
steps
that
rohm
and
haas
has
done
in
this
case
was
fully
explained
to
the
judicial
subcommittees
that
heard
debate
on
these
acts.
one
of
the
very
first
things
that
was
said
in
the
course
of
the
hearings,
--
at
page
4
of
the
1948
hearings
transcript
--
it
was
pointed
out
that
a
necessary
effect
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
is
to
give
a
patentee
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
doing
acts
which
would
constitute
contributory
infringement
of
his
patent
if
done
without
his
permission.
and
necessarily
contributory
infringement
involves
a
measure
of
control
over
something
that
is
outside
the
literal
scope
of
the
claims.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
no,
no,
they
are
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
they
are
to
distributors.
but
the
distributor
acquires
the
right
to
resell
and
his
customers
obtain
the
right
to
use
because
as
to
the
product
we
have
sold
the
monopoly
is
gone.
we
can
exercise
no
control
whatsoever.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
not
as
far
as
i
know.
that
was
recognized
by
the
district
court
and
of
course
it
was
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court's
problem
was
that
it
couldn't
understand
why
section
(d)
(2)
--
i
am
sorry,
(d)
(3)
had
any
relationship
to
(d)
(2),
and
of
course
that
was
corrected
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
contributory
--
i
am
sorry,
i
have
misstated.
the
district
court
could
not
understand
why
the
rights
that
you
acquired
under
(d)
(2)
related
to
section
271(c).
and
of
course
it
must
be
a
contributory
infringement
before
either
(d)
(1)
or
(d)
(2)
even
comes
into
effect.
but
--
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
today?
it
is
sold
by
rohm
and
haas,
it
is
being
sold
by
petitioners
and
--
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
inability
of
the
farmer
to
obtain
access
to
propanil
if
he
wishes
to
use
it
on
his
fields.
there
are
other
competitive
products.
there
are,
i
believe,
six
or
eight
other
herbicides.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
well,
we
can
only
that,
your
honor,
by
looking
at
others
who
produce
propanil.
there
are
approximately
9,000
rice
farmers.
there
are
approximately
3,000
aerial
applicators
who
would
be
practicing
directly
the
method
of
our
patent.
and
this
is
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
patent
of
this
kind
is
trying
to
enforce
it.
if
you
had
to
go
out
and
try
to
license
all
9,000
farmers
or
license
all
3,000
applicators
it
would
cost
you
more
to
get
the
licenses,
in
all
likelihood,
even
if
you
could
get
the
farmers
to
agree
to
it.
so
as
a
practical
matter
the
only
way
you
can
enforce
your
patent
and
maintain
your
exclusivity
is
through
the
doctrine
of
contributory
infringement
which
permits
you
to
go
to
the
source,
if
you
will,
of
the
infringement.
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
there
is
no
legitimate
competition
at
the
present
time
in
propanil.
by
its
very
definition
as
conceded,
anytime
you
sell
propanil
you
are
guilty
of
contributory
infringement
under
section
271(c)
and
because
of
the
definition
of
contributory
infringement
the
sale
of
propanil
by
the
petitioners
necessarily
leads
to
a
direct
infringement.
that
is
the
whole
basis
of
the
distinction
between
staples
and
non-staples.
with
staple
products
there
is
a
legitimate
existing
business
outside
of
the
patent.
with
propanil,
there
is
not.
it
has
no
other
use
except
to
infringe.
propanil
of
course
was
known
from
back
in
1903
as
a
chemical
compound
but
for
50
years
it
had
no
use,
it
was
a
laboratory
curiosity,
it
was
of
no
benefit
to
mankind.
rohm
and
haas,
through
the
expenditure
of
a
lot
of
research
dollars
and
development
dollars
and
obtaining
approval
from
the
government,
developed
a
specific
use
for
propanil
which
has
been
a
great
benefit
to
rice
growers,
to
farmers
and
the
public
in
general.
they
created
the
market
for
propanil
and
today,
some
20
years
after
the
original
disclosure
and
knowledge
and
invention,
the
only
use
of
propanil
remains
in
the
patented
invention.
and
for
so
long
as
it
remains
a
non-staple,
namely
no
use
other
than
as
an
infringement,
we
believe
in
accordance
with
section
271
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
conduct
and
the
activity
which
we
have
carried
out
today.
and
that
activity
and
that
conduct
was
known
to
those
who
considered
the
patent
act.
my
opponent
has
said
that
in
the
early
hearings
--
i
assume
he
is
referring
to
the
1948
and
the
1949
hearings
--
that
mr.
rich,
now
judge
rich,
who
was
a
speak
on
behalf
of
the
act
indicated
that
that
was
the
intention
of
the
language.
that
is
very
clear,
he
did
indicate
and
stated
specifically
that
it
was.
now,
the
language
has
not
changed
in
any
substantial
manner
from
the
time
it
was
first
presented
in
1948
until
the
present
day
when
it
was
enacted
as
section
271.
not
only
did
judge
rich
indicate
that
this
was
the
intended
meaning
or
one
of
the
intended
activities
that
would
be
permitted
without
it
being
a
misuse
but
the
justice
department
vigorously
protested
the
passage
of
section
271.
they
testified
in
1949
and
they
testified
in
1951
and
in
'49,
page
2,
they
said
that
enactment
would
enable
the
patentee
to
exercise
control
over
the
unpatented
materials
usable
in
his
patent
process
and
oust
from
the
marketplace
his
competitor
dealing
in
the
same
material.
that
was
their
basic
criticism.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
i
think
you
are
right
but
i
think
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
dispute
between
the
proponents
and
the
opponents
or
even
those
that
were
considering
the
act
that
that
would
be
permitted.
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
public
policy
would
permit
you
to
--
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
i
would
submit
that
the
justice
department
was
accurately
stating
that
exactly
the
conduct
we
are
doing
today
would
be
permitted.
and
judge
rich
agreed
with
that
and,
indeed,
the
members
of
the
subcommittee
agreed
with
that.
a
statement
was
made
interpreting
the
mercoid
decision.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
question.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
i
am
sure
they
didn't
want
us
to
do
that
under
those
circumstances
mr.
rudolf
e.
hutz
i
would
submit
it
was
directed
to
the
misuse.
and
i
started
to
respond
to
your
question
with
reference
to
the
mercoid
decision.
there
were
a
lot
of
things
decided
in
mercoid
but
one
of
them
dealt
with
the
situation
in
which
licenses
were
granted
only
with
the
sale
of
a
non-staple
and
the
justice
department
recognized
that.
for
example
at
page
54
of
the
'49
hearings
they
characterized
the
mercoid
decision,
and
if
i
may
indulge,
it
said."
instead
of
meeting
its
competition
in
traditional
ways
it
sought
a
competitive
advantage
by
permitting
those
who
bought
its
switches
to
use
them
in
the
patented
combination,
whereas
those
who
bought
the
switches
elsewhere
were
subject
to
attack
for
infringement
and
those
who
sold
switches
were
sued
for
contributory
infringement.
and
that
is
a
characterization
of
the
mercoid
facts
which
can
be
found
at
320
u.s.
676
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
frankfurter.
so
that
one
of
the
evils,
if
you
will,
of
mercoid
was
exactly
the
alleged
evil
that
we
have
here,
and
it
was
recognized
as
such.
and
mr.
rich
was
questioned
whether
or
not
that
wasn't
a
fundamental
reason
for
the
mercoid
holding,
and
he
agreed.
and
mr.
rich
was
asked,
well,
would
that
behavior
be
permitted
under
the
act?
and
the
answer
was
"yes."
very
clearly,
"yes."
so
i
would
submit
that
the
justice
department
has
raised
in
1948
and
1951
exactly
the
arguments
that
were
raised
here
and
fundamentally
congress
faced
that
question,
congress
was
faced
with
a
public
policy
decision
where
do
we
draw
the
line
between
these
competing
doctrines?
and
it
drew
that
line.
it
drew
that
line
after
very,
very
careful
consideration
with
all
of
the
opponents
and
all
the
proponents
and
all
of
the
consideration
that
went
into
that
wording.
and
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
wording
remained
remarkably
the
same
from
the
time
the
act
was
first
introduced
in
1948
until
today.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
eminently
correct.
it
was
a
scholarly
analysis,
yes,
they
weighed
things.
they
said,
well,
if
we
look
at
it
through
the
lens
of
misuse
we
reach
one
result.
if
we
look
at
it
through
the
lens
of
the
patent
law,
we
reach
another
result.
it
was
very
careful
balancing.
what
my
opponent
has
done
is
to
select
certain
portions
where
the
court
was
doing
the
balancing
and
has
ignored
what
the
court
ultimately
held.
and
what
the
court
ultimately
held
was
there
is
no
obligation
to
compulsorily
license
your
patent.
what
the
court
held
was
section
271
permits
you
to
do
one
or
more
of
the
defined
acts.
it
doesn't
require
you
to
license
in
order
to
sell
propanil.
the
effective
result
of
reversing
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
a
compulsory
licensing.
my
opponent
claims
that
it
would
not
be.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
and
it
was
recognized
to
be
the
result
of
compulsory
licensing
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
well
as
by
the
lower
court.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
thank
you
very
much.
