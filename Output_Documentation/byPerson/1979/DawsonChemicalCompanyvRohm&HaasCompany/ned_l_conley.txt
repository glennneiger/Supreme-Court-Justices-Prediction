mr.
ned
l.
conley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
illustrate
the
issue
in
this
case
with
the
following.
two
people
discover
that
two
different
chemicals
can
be
used
as
herbicides
to
kill
weeds
in
ricefields.
these
chemicals
both
kill
weeds
perfectly
satisfactorily.
one
of
the
chemicals
had
no
other
known
use
and
that
is
the
kind
of
chemical
we
call
in
this
case
a
non-staple
material.
the
other
chemical
also
has
other
known
uses
as,
for
example,
maybe
it
could
be
used
making
a
dye.
this
is
called
a
staple
material
in
this
case.
the
contention
of
the
respondent
rohm
and
haas
in
this
case
is
that
one
of
these
inventors
whose
discovery
uses
the
non-staple
material
should
receive
a
greater
reward
for
no
reason
other
than
that
the
material
has
not
previously
been
known
to
have
a
use.
rohm
and
haas'
patent
is
on
a
method
for
killing
weeds
in
ricefields
by
spraying
a
chemical
called
propanil
on
those
weeds
and
on
the
ricefields.
now,
propanil
is
not
patented.
monsanto
company
received
a
patent
on
propanil
in
1968
and
they
sued
rohm
and
haas
for
infringement
of
that
patent
and
rohm
and
haas
proved
that
the
patent
was
invalid,
that
propanil
had
been
known
for
a
long
time.
now,
rohm
and
haas
doesn't
practice
its
patented
invention,
which
is
in
the
method
for
using
propanil.
instead,
since
they
are
a
chemical
company
they
manufacture
propanil
and
they
sell
it.
and
there
are
instructions
on
the
containers
for
using
the
patented
method.
by
virtue
of
this
the
purchasers,
the
farmers
who
use
this
and
spray
it
on
their
ricefields
have
an
implied
license
to
use
that
patented
method.
in
addition
to
this,
rohm
and
haas
has
refused
to
grant
licenses
to
these
farmers
in
any
other
way.
if
the
farmers
want
to
use
the
patented
process
the
only
way
they
can
do
it
is
to
buy
the
unpatented
propanil
from
rohm
and
haas.
otherwise,
they
are
infringers.
now,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
sell
propanil,
too.
they
sold
it
long
before
the
monsanto
patent
issued
in
1968.
our
containers
also
have
labels
on
them
which
give
instructions
for
using
the
propanil
on
ricefields.
we
are
required
to
do
this
by
law,
by
the
epa,
because
otherwise
people
might
misuse
it
and
cause
harm.
because
of
this
rohm
and
haas
sued
the
petitioners
on
the
patent,
on
the
day
it
issued
in
1974.
we
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
this
motion
was
granted.
in
its
very
thorough
opinion
the
district
court
held
that
using
a
patent
to
obtain
a
monopoly
in
propanil,
which
rohm
and
haas
did
not
invent
and
which
was
not
covered
by
the
patent,
was
a
misuse
of
the
patent.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
i
believe
i
can
say
a
qualified
"yes"
to
that,
because
certainly
the
doctrine
of
misuse
is
a
doctrine
that
grew
out
of
attempts
by
patent
owners
to
expand
the
patent
grant
beyond
something
or
to
use
the
patent
in
such
a
way
as
to
obtain
a
control
which
the
patent
grant
in
and
of
itself
does
not
grant
them.
whereas,
the
doctrine
of
contributory
infringement
was
a
doctrine
which
grew
up
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
patentees
a
way
to
enforce
their
patents
to
prevent
infringement
in
situations
where
it
was
impractical
to
file
suit
against
all
the
individual
direct
infringers.
does
that
answer
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
that
is
primarily
true
in
the
case
of
combination
patents
but
i
believe
it
is
also
applicable
in
the
case
of
the
type
of
patent
we
have
here,
which
is
a
patent
on
a
method
of
using
a
chemical.
now,
rohm
and
haas
agrees,
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
agreed,
that
the
owner
of
a
patent
on
a
method
which
uses
one
of
these
staple
chemicals
cannot
compel
those
people
who
want
to
use
the
patented
process
to
buy
the
staple
chemical
from
the
patent
owner.
but
the
court
held,
this
court
of
appeals
held,
that
section
271(c)
and
(d)
were
enacted
by
congress
for
the
purpose
of
authorizing
the
patent
owner
to
monopolize
these
non-staple
materials.
that
was
the
effect
of
their
decision.
as
agreed
by
everyone
who
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
that
271(c)
and
(d)
were
enacted
as
an
outgrowth
of
the
decisions
by
this
court
in
the
two
mercoid
cases
in
1944,
in
those
cases
this
court
found
there
was
patent
misuse
by
one
who
sold
a
non-staple
element
of
a
patented
combination,
the
type
that
you
just
discussed,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
who
licensed,
as
the
patentee
did
there,
other
people
to
sell
this
unpatented
element
and
they
sued
contributory
infringers
who
made
and
sold
the
unpatented
element
without
a
license.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
it
was
a
non-staple
it
was
conceded
to
be
in
that
case.
the
court
went
further
then
and
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
this
decision
left
anything
at
all
of
the
law
of
contributory
infringement.
because
of
the
--
well,
at
least
unrest
that
this
caused
there
was
great
effort
made
again
to
get
a
statutory
law
of
contributory
infringement
enacted.
and
such
a
law
was
enacted,
one
which
specifically
defines
in
subsection
(c)
a
contributory
infringement
is,
in
effect,
the
selling
without
a
license
from
the
patent
owner
of
the
nonstable
material.
and
then
subsection
(d)
was
enacted
which
said
that
those
specific
things,
that
is
the
selling
of
the
non-staple
material,
the
licensing
others
to
sell,
and
the
suing
of
people
who
sell
it
without
license,
that
those
things
would
not
be
misuse
and
that
such
a
patent
owner
who
was
doing
these
things
would
not
be
held
guilty
of
misuse
if
he
was
otherwise
entitled
to
relief.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
in
the
statute
it
says
if
you
do
anyone
of
these
or
any
combination
of
the
three.
well,
the
mercoid
case
did
not
involve
merely
the
selling,
the
licensing
and
the
suing,
it
involved
a
great
deal
more.
in
the
mercoid
cases
this
court
repeated
the
long-standing
rule
limiting
patent
monopolies
to
the
inventions
defined
by
the
patent
claims.
now,
that
rule
has
been
around
probably
since
the
patent
law
was
first
enacted
in
1790
or
when
claims
were
first
thought
of
in
about
1836.
it
was
held
to
be
misuse
in
the
mercoid
cases
for
a
patent
owner
to
condition
a
license
under
his
patent
on
the
purchase
of
an
unpatented
element.
and
the
court
specifically
held
that
that
rule
applied
to
non-staple
materials
or
elements
as
well
as
to
staple
materials
or
elements.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
sect-on
271
or
any
other
part
of
the
1952
act
which
recodifies
the
patent
laws
which
changes
those
specific
rules
of
law
which
were
the
real
basis
for
the
decision
finding
misuse
in
the
mercoid
cases.
instead,
to
the
contrary,
the
recodification
included
section
154
which
defines
the
scope
of
the
patent
grant
as
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
making,
using
or
selling
the
invention.
it
is
conceded
that
rohm
and
haas
did
not
invent
propanil.
that
is
the
way
the
law
has
always
been
and
it
was
continued
without
dissent
in
the
1952
statute.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
correct.
the
real
issue,
i
think,
is
just
that,
as
to
whether
or
not
in
271
that
the
doctrine
of
contributory
infringement
was
restored.
and
the
reason
that
that
question
arose
was
because
there
was
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
it
existed
at
all.
and
so
the
arguments
were
made
to
the
congressional
committees
that
we
had
to
have
a
statutory
statement
of
contributory
infringement
so
that
this
court
would
recognize
that
congress
wanted
patent
owners
to
have
a
right
to
sue
contributory
infringers.
and
that
is
what
congress
did,
is
enact
a
statute
that
says
it
is
o.k.
to
sue
contributory
infringers.
but
the
patents,
the
patent
grants
the
exclusive
rights
only
to
the
invention,
and
271(b)
did
not
say,
or
271(c)
did
not
say
that
the
patent
owner
has
exclusive
rights
in
the
non-staple
element
or
component
of
the
invention.
that
grant
is
stated
in
section
154,
which
says
it
is
just
the
invention
that
the
exclusive
right
extends
to.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
sir,
he
does.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
to
refuse
the
license?
yes,
sir,
he
has
the
right
to
refuse
a
license,
generally
speaking.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
it
is
contended
by
some
that
the
patent
owner
has
a
right
to
refuse
licenses
and
that
what
we
are
trying
to
accomplish
here
is
to
compel
him
to
grant
a
license.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
let
us
put
it
this
way
a
patent
owner
has
only
two
ways
that
he
can
profit
from
his
invention.
one
of
them
is
by
practicing
his
invention
himself
and
the
other
one
is
by
licensing
other
people
to
do
so.
rohm
and
haas
has
chosen
to
license
other
people
to
do
so.
they
don't
want
to
practice
this
invention,
they
have
said
so.
now,
they
want
one
more
thing.
they
want
to
profit
also
by
monopolizing
the
material
used
in
the
practice.
now,
that
is
the
third
thing
that
they
have
done
and
they
have
accomplished
this
by
refusing
to
grant
the
license
except
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
the
material.
now,
what
that
does
is
to
coerce
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
sir?
mr.
ned
l.
conley
the
day
we
were
served
we
asked
for
a
license.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
that
is
right.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
sure.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
we
told
them
so,
and
we
still
would.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
no,
i
don't
think
they
must
grant
us
a
license.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
i
do,
because
of
their
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
i
say
that
we
can
sell
it
to
farmers
whom
they
must
grant
an
alternative.
i
say
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
they
said
they
offered
the
farmers
a
license?
mr.
ned
l.
conley
oh,
they
offered
me
a
license.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
they
would
have
a
right
to
sue
us.
yes,
sir,
i
agree
they
have
a
right
to
sue
us.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
because
if
we
sold
it
then
we
would
be
guilty
of
contributory
infringement
and
there
would
be
no
coercion
of
these
farmers,
because
they
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
no
only
that
he
has
to
give
the
farmer
an
alternative.
it
is
just
as
though
i
were
in
the
business
of
selling
two
different
commodities
and
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
by
merely
telling
him
that
if
he
wants
to
practice
the
invention
by
use
of
propanil,
purchase
from
someone
else,
then
a
license
is
available.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
no,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
loss
there,
because
they
would
receive
--
by
either
party,
because
they
would
receive
exactly
what
they
are
entitled
to,
and
that
is
the
royalty
that
they
would
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
we
both
win,
right.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
oh,
no,
they
can
set
the
royalty
as
high
as
is
necessary
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
if
we
refused
it
and
they
continued
to
make
available
to
the
farmers
a
license
alternatively
to
the
one
tied
to
the
purchase
of
the
material,
yes,
we
would
be
in
trouble.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
no
more
does
any
other
patentee
of
a
patent
which
uses
staple,
materials.
if
he
decides
to
sell
his
staple
materials,
he
has
no
bargaining
power.
he
puts
in
the
price
of
his
material
15
cents
of
this
price
is
a
royalty,
if
you
want
to
buy
the
material
somewhere
else
we
will
grant
you
a
license.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
it
is
conceded
it
has
none.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
sir,
that
is
right.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
sir.
now,
i
think
the
essence
of
what
i
was
trying
to
say
a
moment
ago
is
that
congress
didn't
include
in
the
statute
any
right
to
monopolize.
now,
they
could
have
done
so,
they
could
have
changed
section
154
or
they
could
have
put
another
provision
in
section
271,
or
something
else,
perhaps,
that
would
explicitly
provide
what
rohm
and
haas
contend
is
provided
by
implication
in
here.
i
submit
that
the
implication
that
they
seek
is
explicitly
negated
by
the
words
"otherwise
entitled
to
relief"
that
are
in
section
271(b).
now,
the
committee
reports
that
were
issued
by
the
congressional
committees
following
the
hearings
that
were
held,
show
that
there
was
no
intent
to
change
the
law.
the
main
purpose,
they
said,
of
sections
271(c)
and
(d)
was
clarification
and
stabilization
and
to
incorporate
the
court-made
law
of
contributory
infringement.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
sir.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
senator
mccarren
said
when
asked
generally
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
this
statute
--
title
35
as
a
whole,
he
was
talking
about
--
did
not
make
any
changes,
it
merely
codified
the
law.
and
then
he
inserted
into
the
record,
by
unanimous
consent,
a
prepared
statement
which
included
in
it
the
general
statement
that
due
to
some
court
decisions
there
were
some
changes
made.
and
that
is
all
that
happened.
it
was
immediately
after
that
there
was
a
vote,
without
any
recess,
and
the
statute
was
enacted.
and
that
is
all
that
took
place.
he
did
not
point
directly
to
section
271
or
specifically
he
did
not
say
that
it
was
intended
to
expand
the
patent
grant
to
allow
a
monopoly
of
something
that
the
patentee
didn't
invent.
i
think
he
would
have
said
so
if
that
is
what
he
had
intended
to
do.
i
don't
think
he
would
have
answered
it
that
way.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
we
have
some
advantages,
i
think,
over
a
large
corporation
like
rohm
and
haas.
we
can
cut
the
cost
some
and
still
make
a
profit
and
get
by
without
--
and
pay
the
royalty,
too.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
specifically,
mr.
justice
white,
the
misuse
is
in
the
coercion
of
the
farmers,
the
conditioning
of
the
granting
of
a
license
on
the
sale
and
the
purchase
by
the
farmer
of
this
unpatented
material.
and
that
is
all
it
is,
that
is
all
the
misuse
is.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
sir?
mr.
ned
l.
conley
oh,
i
see
no
problem
there,
really.
it
is
done
all
the
time.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
well,
one
of
the
things
that
we
suggest
because
it
is
commonly
used,
even
by
rohm
and
haas
itself,
is
a
label
licensing
program
where
they
apply
to
the
label
of
their
can
a
statement
that
the
price
includes
a
royalty
and
if
they
want
to
purchase
elsewhere,
well,
such
licenses
are
available.
we
as
people
who
manufacture
and
sell
the
product
would
be
more
than
glad
to
handle
the
paperwork
and
so
forth
to
provide
the
license.
the
price
is
not
going
to
be
very
much
different
as
between
competing
suppliers
of
the
material,
so
there
is
probably
not
going
to
be
any
enforcement
problem
at
all.
undoubtedly,
their
patent
would
go
right
on
for
the
full
17
years
and
they
would
receive
their
royalties
all
the
time.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
or
give
the
farmer
a
license,
whichever
way.
or
they
can
decide
that
they
are
going
to
do
all
the
application
themselves,
they
can
practice
their
own
invention.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that.
now,
i
understand
why
rohm
and
haas
doesn't
want
to;
but
they
could
do
it.
and
then
they
don't
have
to
grant
anybody
a
license.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
oh,
buying
some
spraying
equipment
and
going
around
and
spraying
farms.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
now,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
by
--
in
the
briefs
about
some
testimony
at
committee
hearings
on
this
bill.
the
testimony
on
early
bills
--
not
in
this
bill,
but
on
earlier
bills
--
did
indicate
there
was
an
intention
by
at
least
one
of
the
witnesses
--
mr.
rich,
who
is
now
judge
rich
--
to
allow
the
precise
type
of
activity
that
we
are
questioning
in
this
case.
and
by
1951
hearing
on
the
bill
that
passed
finally,
mr.
rich
did
not
make
any
such
statement.
in
fact
he
--
when
asked
directly,
he
refused
to
confirm
that
that
was
his
attitude.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
the
language
was
slightly
different
but
the
meaning
was
in
essence
the
same,
i
think.
this
court
has
on
at
least
six
different
occasions
since
1952
made
statements
that
the
rule
of
law
of
the
mercoid
cases
still
applies.
the
aro
cases
are
the
most
significant.
there
were
two
of
those,
one
in
1961
and
one
in
1964.
and
the
1961
case
it
was
held
that
although
the
misuse
defense
had
been
weighed
in
that
case
the
mercoid
cases
were
still
good
authority
on
the
scope
of
the
patent.
and
the
court
held
that
the
claims
of
the
patent
were
the
sole
measure
of
the
grant
and
a
patentee
was
not
entitled
to
any
monopoly
on
the
elements
of
the
invention.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
there
were
contributory
infringements.
in
the
second
mercoid
case
there
was
a
specific
situation
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
aro
--
the
second
aro
case,
there
was
a
specific
situation
where
ford
had
a
license,
which
they
passed
on
to
their
customers,
which
allowed
customers
to
use
the
patented
combination
but
only
if
they
bought
the
unpatented
fabric
from
ford.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
convertible
top,
that
is
right;
that
was
the
case.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
an
invalid
extension
of
the
patent
in
that
particular
case,
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
do
it
and
would
not
enforce
it.
now
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
well,
i
agree
with
what
judge
gee
finally
concluded,
and
that
is
that
on
the
whole
those
cases
cut
against
his
opinion.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
i
don't
know
specifically
what
you
are
referring
to.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
i
certainly
have.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes.
i
believe
that
his
analysis
generally
was
fairly
accurate.
i
do
not
think
that
he
treated
the
ford
license
situation
to
which
i
just
referred,
though.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
it
is
inherent
in
the
patentee.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
he
doesn't
say
--
he
can
only
have
a
license
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
right.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
right.
and
he
tells
them
on
the
label
how
to
use
it.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
and
thereby
grants
him
a
license.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
and
then
he
doesn't?
well,
you
know,
you
can
commit
sin
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
he
can
commit
sins
of
omission
as
well
as
a
commission.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
he
won't
furnish
the
farmer
a
license,
unless
he
buys
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
nor
anybody
else,
unless
they
buy
the
material
from
rohm
and
haas.
and
what
they
do
by
that,
mr.
justice
white,
is
they
take
this
patent
that
they
got
on
a
method
of
use
and
they
say,
i
can't
use
that
patent,
i
am
not
in
the
business
of
applying
propanil
or
of
spraying
crops
or
of
raising
rice
of
anything
like
that,
i
can't
use
that.
now,
i
have
tried
to
get
a
patent
on
propanil
but
the
patent
office
wouldn't
let
me
have
one,
they
give
it
to
monsanto
and
i
got
it
declared
invalid.
but
i
don't
like
the
patent
i
have
got
and
i
am
going
to
use
my
patent
to
get
the
monopoly
the
patent
office
wouldn't
give
me.
that
is
what
they
have
got.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
he
can.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
correct.
but
you
know
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
--
he
had
the
right
to
sell
propanil
before.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
that
was
not
given
to
him
by
271.
he
had
the
right
to
sue
contributory
infringers
before.
that
was
not
given
to
him
271,
either.
but
he
never
had
the
right
to
condition
licenses
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
because
he
sells
it
with
a
license
and
refuses
to
grant
a
license
without
it.
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
leitch
v.
barber
case
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
he
refuses
to
grant
a
license
without
the
purchase
of
the
propanil.
and
he
has
expressly
refused.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
he
refused
it
to
my
client
and
to
one
single
farmer
who
wrote
to
us.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
and
he
has
stipulated
that
he
refuses.
it
is
stipulated,
it
is
one
of
the
facts
of
this
case
that
he
will
not
grant
any
licenses
except
with
the
purchase
of
propanil.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
it
is
in
the
stipulation
that
was
filed
before
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
granted.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
what
is
that?
mr.
ned
l.
conley
it
is
inconsistent
when
you
look
at
all
of
the
cases
that
came
before.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
that
the
refusal
to
grant
a
license
is
not
inconsistent?
it
is,
sir,
if
you
understand
the
law
of
patent
misuse
and
apply
the
law
of
patent
misuse.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
no,
sir,
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
it
did
not.
the
law
of
patent
misuse
developed
out
of
the
motion
picture
case
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir,
it
developed
out
of
the
motion
picture
case
where
this
court
specifically
limited
the
scope
of
a
right
to
exclude
to
the
invention
that
was
made.
and
in
the
carbice
case
in
1931
was
when
they
first
said
well,
it
becomes
a
misuse
of
the
patent,
that
the
patentee
is
now
allowed
to
take
his
license
that
he
has,
his
right
he
has
to
license
people,
and
tell
the
people
who
buy
from
his
an
unpatented
material
that
they
can
only
have
that
license
if
they
buy
the
patented
material
from
me.
the
leitch
v.
barber
case
then
came
along
in
1942,
i
believe,
or
'38,
and
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
expressly
says
that
you
must
buy
this
material
from
me
to
get
a
license
or
whether
it
is
merely
implied
by
the
fact
that
you
refuse
to
grant
any
licenses
except
with
the
purchase
of
the
unpatented
material.
now,
we
had
the
morton
salt
case
and
we
had
the
b.b.
chemical
case
and
the
same
theme
was
repeated
every
time
and
they
never
said
it
is
limited
to
staples,
they
never
said
it
made
any
difference
what
the
nature
of
the
unpatented
element
was
in
any
of
those
cases.
but
the
patent
owners,
they
kept
on
pushing,
pushing,
pushing,
until
they
finally
got
to
the
mercoid
cases.
and
the
mercoid
case
made
explicit
what
had
been
certainly
not
excluded
from
any
of
the
previous
decisions,
and
that
is
that
it
applies
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
component.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
it
was
intended
to
clarify
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
statements
in
mercoid
to
the
effect
that
what
there
may
be
left
of
the
doctrine
of
contributory
infringement
we
do
not
stop
to
consider.
if
that
language
had
not
been
there,
i
seriously
doubt
if
we
would
be
here
today.
because
i
think
that
throughout
the
legislative
history
it
is
very
clear
that
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
straighten
out
the
confusion
that
had
been
generated.
one
district
court
held
that
it
was
a
misuse
of
the
patent
to
just
file
a
suit
for
contributory
infringement.
now,
mercoid
didn't
say
that.
but
that
was
the
fear
and
some
of
the
courts
held
that.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
sir
indeed,
it
did.
so
they
put
three
specific
things
in.
they
put
first
a
specific
definition
of
contributory
infringement
and
three
specific
things
that
they
say
are
not
misuse,
or
any
combination
of
those.
but
they
didn't
say
anything
about
extending
the
scope
of
a
patent
beyond
the
scope
of
the
grant,
which
mr.
justice
white
said
in
at
least
three
opinions
that
he
wrote,
i
know,
that
you
can't
do.
and
those
are
since
1952.
the
aro
cases
made
very
clear
you
couldn't
do
that.
deepsouth
was
one
of
them,
there
was
the
blonder-tongue
case
and
there
was
one
other
one
--
what
is
that
other
one
--
mr.
ned
l.
conley
yes,
sir.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
no.
we
are
talking
about
scope
of
patent,
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here
today.
we
are
talking
about
an
attempt
to
obtain
a
monopoly
which
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
invention.
what
they
invented
was
a
method;
they
didn't
invent
propanil,
they
never
discovered
it.
the
constitution
says
you
can
grant
patents
to
inventors
on
their
discoveries.
they
didn't
discover
propanil,
they
admit
they
didn't.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
i
don't
know
of
a
single
case
when
they
haven't
done
so.
and
what
we
are
trying
to
find
here
is
that
implication
from
a
statute,
that
that
was
what
their
intention
was.
surely
they
have
got
to
show
that
congress
at
sometime
or
other
made
patent
grant
or
passed
a
statute
which
allowed
patent
rights
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
constitutional
specific
authority.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
it
probably
doesn't.
but
there
ought
to
at
least
to
be
some
indication
by
someone
and
not
the
offhand
remark
that
no,
it
doesn't
even
change
anything,
like
senator
mccarren
said,
or
certainly
they
wouldn't
put
in
their
carefully
prepared
committee
report
that
the
intention
was
clarification,
if
that
had
been
their
intention
to
do
something
they
had
never
done
before,
and
that
is
grant
a
patent
right
outside
the
scope
of
article
1,
section
(a),
clause
(a).
mr.
ned
l.
conley
there
is
not
a
fourth
paragraph
in
(d).
mr.
ned
l.
conley
precisely.
mr.
ned
l.
conley
and
since
that
is
precisely
what
mercoid
held,
was
a
misuse.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
reverse
that
precise
holding,
wouldn't
they
have
put
in
a
fourth
part
in
(d)?
it
seems
logical
to
me
that
they
would
have.
