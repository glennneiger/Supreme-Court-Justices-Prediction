mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
a
number
of
amici
here
today
and
without
equivocation
my
comments
favor
the
respondent.
the
essence
of
my
comments
are
that
the
patented
herbicidal
use
of
the
non-staple,
per
se
unpatentable
propanil,
should
not
be
subject
to
compulsory
licensing,
for
public
policy
reasons
and
for
statutory
reasons.
the
amici
i
represent
are
all
nonprofit
organizations.
they
are
all
significant
participants
in
what
we
label
the
research,
development
and
commercialization
processes.
from
the
agricultural
sector
is
the
national
agricultural
chemicals
association,
the
ag
association
for
short.
its
120
member
companies
produce,
formulate
and
sell
most
of
the
pesticides
in
the
united
states.
propanil,
a
herbicide,
is
a
specific
type
of
pesticide.
the
ag
business
is
big
business
and
it
is
high
technology.
for
example,
there
are
$32
billion
of
agricultural
products
exported
a
year.
and
the
high
technology
character
of
agriculture
is
set
out
in
the
ag
association
brief
in
section
1.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
it
is
not
a
misuse,
your
honor.
there
is
a
practical
factor
to
this.
for
example,
there
are
the
9,000
rice
farmers
and,
in
addition,
that
is
complicated
further
by
the
fact
that
they
just
don't
spray
this,
they
use
aerial
applicators
to
spray
the
propanil.
there
are
3,000
aerial
applicators,
using
86,000
aircraft.
this
gets
us
to
the
hub
of
the
contributory
infringement
doctrine.
there
are
three
petitioners.
the
hub
of
the
contributory
infringement
doctrine
is
that
it
is
impractical
to
go
after
these
9,000
farmers
plus
3,000
aerial
applicators.
but
it
is
practical
to
stop
the
contributory
infringers.
and
congress
in
section
271(c)
and
(d)
was
explicit
with
respect
to
non-staple
articles.
the
significance
of
the
non-staple
article
is
that
it
creates
a
market.
it
is
not
a
monopoly.
a
monopoly
means
that
there
is
something
there
before
that
was
taken
away.
in
this
case
it
is
an
exclusive
right
provided
under
section
154
of
the
statute
and
that
statute
says
that
every
patent
shall
have
that
right
to
exclude.
and
as
you
go
further
with
that
on
the
economics
of
this,
the
plain
fact
is
that
the
price
of
rice
is
determined
on
the
commodity
market.
propanil
is
a
tool
for
the
farmer.
if
he
doesn't
to
pay
that
price
or
if
he
thinks
it
is
excessive,
he
then
doesn't
buy
it.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
well,
the
patent
is
of
value.
i
think
we
are
dealing
with
--
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
no,
as
a
practical
matter
when
there
are
contributory
infringers
in
that
group
--
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
that
is
a
contention.
i
am
not
sure
that
the
law
has
gone
that
far
yet.
we
do
know
that
the
laws,
namely
271(c)
and
(d),
are
explicit
on
the
non-staple.
and
a
good
reason
for
it
being
explicit
on
the
non-staple
is
that
there
is
no
other
market
--
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
well,
let
us
draw
an
analogy
with
salt.
take
the
morton
salt
case,
where
you
had
a
device,
just
to
draw
the
line
on
patentability
items.
in
morton
salt
there
were
salt
tablets
but
the
item
that
was
patented
was
a
device.
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
salt
tablet
per
se.
and
so
the
court
back
then
said,
well,
look,
it
is
misuse
to
try
to
control
that
salt
tablet.
now,
let
us
take
a
step
closer,
let
us
take
the
situation
in
mercoid.
there
is
a
combination
there,
and
there
is
a
stoker
switch.
that
stoker
switch
was
said
to
have
no
other
use
than
in
that
combination.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
but
nevertheless
that
stoker
switch
was
unpatented.
now,
take
the
case
of
propanil.
propanil
is
not
patentable
per
se,
as
a
compound.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
but
its
use
is
patentable.
it
use
is
patented.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
yes.
but
its
use
is
patented
as
distinguished,
say,
from
the
unpatentability
of
the
stoker
switch
in
mercoid.
the
use
of
that
switch
per
se
was
not
patentable.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
only
in
the
combination.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
no.
but
that
is
quite
different
than
the
patented
herbicidal
use
of
propanil
that
we
have
here.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
yes,
i
think
that
is
an
area
that
is
yet
to
be
developed.
for
example,
may
i
draw
this
--
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
congress
did
draw
a
very
clear
line
between
staples
and
non-staples.
and
it
said
in
the
connection
with
non-staples
that
while
using
this
contributory
infringement
doctrine
that
it
wasn't
subject
to
misuse
if
you
did
the
three
things
that
he
enumerates
in
section
(d).
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
yes.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
well
--
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
none
of
those
three
things
constitute
misuse,
per
se.
mr.
eugene
l.
bernard
yes.
well,
the
bottom
line
on
the
amici
is
that
they
are
all
involved
in
the
research
and
development
and
commercialization
activity
and
that
they
are
all
concerned
about
having
this
non-staple,
per
se
unpatentable
chemical,
as
a
resource
for
their
activities.
and
the
significance
of
it
as
a
resource
is,
point
1,
there
are
10
million
compounds.
compare
that
with
50,000
in
commerce.
point
2,
in
a
survey
conducted
in
1975
of
the
33,600
compounds
that
were
considered
to
have
been
included
in
major
chemical
developments,
8,400
were
those
that
new
uses
were
found
for.
point
3,
the
universities
--
researchers
at
universities
and
elsewhere
want
to
publish
and
in
publishing
they
frequently
publish
compounds
that
are
in
the
early
stages
for
which
they
have
no
known
use
or
utility.
and
by
having
this
patent
protection
available,
as
you
move
down
the
line
this
gives
an
opportunity
to
promote
further
work
with
respect
to
those
then
useless
chemicals.
and
in
item
4
within
the
area
of
the
pesticides,
a
survey
conducted
in
1972,
20
percent
of
the
pesticides
had
no
use
other
than
this
use
protection.
and
the
character
of
the
investment
and
high
risk
involved
here,
for
example
to
get
a
pesticide
approved
requires
going
through
the
epa.
and
in
going
through
the
epa,
there
is
much
experimental
work
required
and
it
runs
over
several
years.
the
year
factor
is
eight
years
at
a
cost
of
roughly
$15
million-plus.
now
that
eight
years
also
comes
out
of
the
patent
grant.
but
in
looking
at
the
character
of
the
protection
provided,
in
dealing
with
patents
we
are
talking
about
subject
matter
and
conduct.
the
subject
matter
is
defined
by
the
claims
but
then
before
that
patent
is
granted
it
is
screened
by
the
patent
office
to
insure
that
it
meets
the
conditions
of
patentability.
and
patents
are
classified
in
several
ways.
one
of
them
is
in
products,
per
se.
another
is
in
the
use
patent
which
is
set
forth
in
100
(b)
and
101.
100
(b)
is
new
with
the
1972
patent
act.
it
interrelates
with
section
271
and
in
this
interrelationship
it
also
interrelates
to
section
154
that
says
every
patent
shall
have
this
right
to
exclude.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
