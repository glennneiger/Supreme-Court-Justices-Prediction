suppose
you
put
every
company
in
a
particular
industry
out
of
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
under
your
more
or
less
absolutive
view,
what
would
the
situation
be
if
that
did
arise?
justice
byron
r.
white
bearable
to
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
industry-wide.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
example
i
just
put
started
out
being
industry-wide,
but
you
lost
--
take
the
automobile
industry,
there
are
only
four
major
companies
in
it,
i
think.
would
you
let
two
go
down
the
drain,
or
how
would
you
draw
the
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
it's
not,
but
your
brief
leads
one
to
wonder
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
were
very
large
corporations
and
only
about
10
or
12
of
them,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
twenty.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
i
understand
the
government's
position
still
to
be
that
within
any
conception
of
the
meaning
of
feasibility
that
the
secretary
need
give
no
consideration
whatever
to
the
benefits
to
be
derived,
health
benefits?
your
brief
so
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
you
do
that,
bear
in
mind
that
your
brief,
on
page
48,
in
black
letters,
says
"section
655(b)(5)
prohibits
basing
a
standard
on
a
cost-benefit
test."
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
mean
no
consideration
whatever
can
be
given
to
the
benefits?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
alsup,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions
about
the
statutory
language?
the
first
sentence,
the
toxic
materials
sentence
says
that
"the
secretary
shall
set
the
standard
which
most
adequately
assures",
and
so
he's
got
to
pick
the
one
which
is
most
adequate.
now,
is
the
word
"standard"
as
used
in
that
sentence
the
same
or
something
different
than
the
word
"standard"
as
defined
in
section
3,
subparagraph
(8)?
where
the
"reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate"
language
is
used
in
the
definition
of
the
word
"standard".
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
mean
that
any
standard
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute
must
be
one
that's
reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
that's
a
different
position
from
the
one
you
took
in
your
brief.
you
seem
to
argue
in
your
brief
that
the
reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate
language
did
not
apply
to
toxic
materials
standards.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
putting
to
one
side
for
a
moment
what
the
language
means,
i
just
want
to
get
fixed
in
my
mind
your
position
on
whether
or
not
that
language
modifies
the
word
"standard"
as
it
appears
in
6(b)(5)
and
i
understand
you
to
say
yes.
but
all
it
requires
is
that
it
fulfill
the
objective
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
included
in
the
definition
of
the
word.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
they
are
just
procedural.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we're
talking
about
the
substance,
what
is
it
that
avoids
this
being
the
schechter
case,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
suggested
that
there
has
to
be
an
appreciable
health
benefit
before
he
should
issue
a
standard
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
you
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
used
the
word.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
doesn't
have
to
have
an
appreciable
health
benefit?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
have
to
have
a
health
benefit?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
it
might
be
a
health
benefit
or
that
there
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
be
based
on
the
fact
that
there
would
be
so
little
health
benefits
the
costs
weren't
worth
it
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
your
test?
i
thought
you
said
that
that
sort
of
consideration
should
go
into
the
decision
whether
to
issue
a
standard
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
of
the
art.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
warren,
what
troubles
me
about
your
position,
frankly,
is
what
happens
if
you
win
and
it
goes
back
and
they
say,
well,
we're
going
to
accept
--
i
forget
the
name
of
the
doctor's
finding
we
think
that
two
deaths
in
six
years
are
predictable,
and
will
occur.
and
a
half
billion
dollars
is
worth
saving
those
two
lives.
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
earlier
in
your
argument,
mr.
lettow,
you
suggested
that
if
this
standard
prevails,
that
the
tire
industry
just
won't
make
the
grade,
that
it
will
shut
down.
did
i
understand
you
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
made
some
remark
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
pretty
strong
remark,
and
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
indicates
that
it
must
be
feasible
and
that
the
secretary
should
not
just
close
down
an
industry.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
open
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you're
right,
you'll
win.
if
you're
right,
you'll
win.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
but
--
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
it,
so
that
issue
is
still
open.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
the
secretary
must
believe
that
the
standard
is
feasible.
or
do
you
think
the
secretary
doesn't
support
the
view
of
your
colleague
that
he
should
not
close
down
an
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
feasibility
issue
would
have
to
be
remanded,
would
it
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
to
osha?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
were
right
and
it
was
not
feasible,
and
that
meant
the
standard
was
not
valid,
it
would
certainly
save
us
an
awful
lot
of
work.
