mr.
william
h.
alsup
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
secretary
of
labor's
occupational
standard
for
benzene
satisfies
the
statutory
requirements
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
of
1970.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
it
did
not
satisfy
those
requirements,
and
the
case
is
here
on
the
petition
of
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
industrial
union
department
of
the
afl-cio.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
the
specific
statutory
requirements
at
issue
are
several.
the
fifth
circuit
held
principally
that
the
statutory
requirement
that
was
violated
was
a
requirement
that
an
occupational
health
and
safety
standard
be,
quote,
"reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate
to
achieving
healthful
and
safe
working
places.
"the
court
held
that
the
standard
which
is
not
reasonably
necessary,
if
it
does
not
bear
a
reasonable
relationship
--
the
benefits
of
the
standard
bear
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
clause
of
the
standard,
and
that,
in
addition,
it
does
not
satisfy
that
clause
if
they
are
not
quantifiable
benefits.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
with
respect
to
that
particular
clause,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
believe
that
that
is
an
enabling
clause
that
appears
in
many
statutes
that
confer
rule-making
authority
on
agencies.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
achievable.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
economically
achievable,
technologically
achievable.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
in
the
first
sentence
of
section
6(b)(5),
which
we
believe
is
the
heart
of
the
act,
congress
gave
a
very
definite
guidance
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
that
sentence
says
that
in
setting
health
standards
for
toxic
substances,
the
secretary
shall
set
the
standard
which
most
adequately
assures,
to
the
extent
feasible,
based
on
the
best
available
evidence,
that
no
employee
shall
suffer
material
impairment
of
health
or
functional
capacity,
even
if
he
is
supposed
to
the
hazard
dealt
with
for
his
entire
working
life.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
we
think
that
it
means
achievable,
and
the
legislative
history,
we
believe,
supports
our
interpretation.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
technologically
achievable
means
either
that
the
technology
is
available
to
implement
the
engineering
controls
necessary
to
meet
permissible
exposure
levels,
or
that
as
--
although
this
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
as
the
circuits
have
held
--
that
the
technology,
even
though
it's
not
available
at
this
time,
it's
reasonable
to
conclude
that
it
is,
as
one
of
the
circuits
said,
looming
on
the
horizon.
and
there
it
is
a
technology
enforcing
statute
in
that
sense.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
absolutely
not.
here
there
is
a
very
clear
directive
that
says
that
if
congress
in
fact
meant
technologically
feasible,
achievable,
and
economically
achievable,
it's
a
clear
directive,
a
mandatory
directive
to
the
secretary
of
labor
to
set
that
standard.
this
is
not
a
blank
check
for
the
secretary
of
labor
to
do
anything
he
wants.
congress
has
set
a
--
weighted
its
own
balance
of
health
benefits
versus
health
costs
and
has
struck
that
balance
and
described
it
in
the
first
sentence
of
section
6(b)(5),
and
has
directed
the
secretary
of
labor
to
follow
that
standard
in
every
health
standard
that's
issued
for
toxic
substances.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
if
feasible.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
the
statute
does
not,
but
it
has
used
that
word
in
numerous
other
statutes
and
beyond
that
the
clear
legislative
history
here
shows
that
they
meant
by
the
word
"feasible",
"to
the
greatest
extent
possible".
we
don't
think
the
legislative
history
is
ambiguous
on
this
point.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
the
legislation
itself
uses
the
word
"feasible"
and
we
believe
that
that
means
achievable.
it
does
not
mean
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
--
the
economic
feasibility
means,
in
our
view
that
it
is
bearable
by
the
affected
industry.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
by
the
entire
industry,
not
by
each
employer.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
congress
contemplated
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
economic
injury
to
some
companies.
in
fact,
in
section
22
of
the
act,
they
provided
that
the
small
business
administration
is
authorized
to
make
small
business
loans
to
companies
that,
if
they
can
demonstrate
that
they
will
be
--
and
this
is
the
wording
of
the
statute
--
suffer
a
substantial
economic
injury
as
a
result
of
compliance
with
the
act.
there
is
no
question
but
that
congress
recognized
the
achievement
of
the
health
and
safety
goals
would
be
expensive.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
case
has
never
arisen
and
it's
not
likely
to
arise.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
mr.
justice,
we
do
not
have
an
absolutist
view
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
standards
must
be
feasible,
at
a
bearable
cost.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
bearable
to
the
industry.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
industry-wide.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
should
begin
by
saying
that
that
question
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
could
i
--
because
it's
important
to
understand
that
that
question
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
first
let
me
say
that
in
this
case
the
secretary
found
that
the
costs
were
well
within
the
financial
capability
of
the
affected
industry.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
there
are
20
industries
all
together.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
with
hundreds
of
companies
involved,
not
just
12
companies
hundreds
of
companies
in
20
different
industries
that
are
affected
by
this
standard.
at
a
total
cost
of
engineering
controls
of
$266
million,
recurring
annual
cost
of
$34
million,
and
first-year
operating
costs
of
$186
to
$205
million.
spread
across
hundreds
of
companies
in
20
different
industries.
now,
you
raise
a
question.
we
do
say
that
all
the
secretary
has
to
do
with
respect
to
economics
is
to
show
that
the
industry
can
afford
it.
the
third
circuit
and,
i
believe,
the
d.
c.
circuit
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
what
economic
feasibility
means
is
that
so
long
as
there
is
no
"massive
dislocation"
of
the
industry,
the
standard
is
economically
feasible.
this
court
does
not
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
would
take
the
word
"feasibility"
to
that
point.
although
the
secretary
believes
that
in
a
proper
case
we
might
make
that
argument.
in
this
case
this
is
so
clearly
within
the
capability
of
the
affected
industry
that
it
is
clearly
a
standard
which
is
economically
feasible.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
could
i
explain
how
the
secretary
considers
benefits
and
costs
in
deciding
to
issue
a
standard?
mr.
william
h.
alsup
oh,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct
that
once
the
secretary
decides
to
issue
a
standard,
he
cannot
trade
lives
against
dollars.
he
must
either
set
a
safe
level
or
a
level
which
is
achievable
at
a
bearable
cost
even
though
it's
not
a
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no,
that
is
not
correct.
let
me
explain
how
that
works.
first
of
all,
there
are
thousands
of
carcinogens
in
industrial
work
places.
the
secretary
and
the
national
institute
for
occupational
safety
and
health
are
trying
to
gather
as
much
information
as
they
can
on
the
various
extents
of
risk
that
each
of
these
types
of
carcinogens
and
other
toxic
substances
pose.
in
fact,
the
secretary
has
not
regulated
that
many
substances
up
to
this
point.
but
in
making
the
decision
which
ones
to
regulate
first,
the
secretary
does
consider
whether
or
not
a
substance
is
dangerous,
it
affects
a
lot
of
employees
and
there
is
a
lot
to
be
gained
by
attacking
this
carcinogen
problem
first.
so
that's
the
first
way,
in
a
rough
sense,
the
balancing
of
benefits
and
cost
come
into
play.
the
second
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
in
the
priority
setting
phase,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
the
secretary
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
not
the
way
--
the
secretary
just
doesn't
cast
his
gaze
across
industry
and
pick
on
one
rather,
it
comes
to
his
attention
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
with
particular
industrial
carcinogens.
then
the
secretary
says,
which
industry
is
that
thing
being
used
in,
and
let's
take
a
look
at
it.
so
that's
the
way
the
priorities
are
set.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
yes.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
yes.
the
secretary
does
consider
that.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
but
i
have
to
make
a
very
clear
distinction
here
between
a
decision
to
issue
the
standard
at
all
versus
once
the
secretary
decides
to
issue
the
standard,
where
does
he
have
to
go?
now,
in
the
first
question,
the
prior
question
of
after
all
the
evidence
is
in
what
does
the
secretary
do,
does
he
decide
that
it's
worthwhile
to
go
ahead
and
issue
the
standard,
the
secretary
does
consider
whether
or
not
the
standard
required
by
6(b)(5)
has,
in
a
rough
sense,
benefits
and
has,
in
a
rough
sense,
costs.
the
answer
is
clearly
yes,
and
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
certainly
in
our
reply
brief,
that
the
secretary
does
consider
costs
and
benefits
and
balancing
them
for
the
purpose
of
whether
or
not
to
issue
the
standard
at
all.
but,
mr.
justice,
my
point
is
that
once
the
secretary
decides
to
issue
the
standard,
having
decided
that
it's
worthwhile,
he
has
to
go
to
the
standards
required
by
the
first
sentence
of
section
6(b)(5)
and
that
is,
either
a
safe
level
or
the
lowest
feasible
level
that
can
be
achieved.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
to
the
point
where
it
is
most
adequately
assured,
to
the
extent
feasible,
that
no
employee
will
suffer
material
harm.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
if
it
were
feasible
to
do
that,
that
could
be
done.
in
this
case
it's
not
feasible
to
ban
benzene.
and
therefore
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
mr.
justice,
there
was
a
very
long
rule-making
hearing,
a
voluminous
record,
in
which
industry
after
industry
came
in
and
testified
as
to
the
ways
in
which
benzene
is
used,
and
it
was
very
clear
from
the
preamble
that
the
secretary
wrote
and
from
the
evidence
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
to
industry
you
can't
use
benzene
at
all.
i
could
add
at
this
point
that
that's
been
true
in
all
of
the
carcinogen
standards
issued
by
the
secretary.
there's
never
been
any
suggestion
by
the
secretary
that
he
intends
to
ban
a
particular
substance
altogether.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
word
"standard"
as
used
in
section
3(b)
certainly
includes
a
standard
that's
used
in
section
6(b)(5).
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
our
position
on
the
phrase
"reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate"
is
that
congress,
in
statute
after
statute,
has
said
to
agencies
that
they
may
issue
regulations
deemed
by
that
agency
to
be
necessary
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.
that
is
essentially
what
that
definitional
provision
provides.
in
case
after
case,
this
court
has
said
that
that
sort
of
enabling
language
"necessary
or
reasonable"
or
"reasonably
necessary"
--
the
case
has
never
come
up
yet
actually
that
said
"reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate"
but
"reasonably
necessary"
has,
"appropriate"
and
"necessary".
now,
in
all
of
those
cases
the
court
has
said
that
what
that
means
is
that
any
regulation
which
the
secretary
concludes
advances
the
purposes
of
the
act
falls
within
that
language.
it
is
not
a
balancing
test,
it's
a
rational
basis
test.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
correct
the
secretary
is
only
authorized
to
issue
standards
that
are
reasonably
necessary
and
appropriate.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
that
would
be
theoretically
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
don't
think
it's
just
a
matter
that
we
differ.
we
think
the
court's
precedent
on
the
words
like
"reasonably
necessary"
and
"appropriate"
are
quite
clear
that
this
is
something
that
advances
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
therefore
meets
that
definitional
question.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
the
first
sentence
of
6(b)(5)
only
covers
toxic
substances
and
harmful
physical
agents
like
radiation.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
it
does
not
--
correct,
it
does
not
cover
safe
work
practices.
those,
however,
can
be
what
we
call
6(b)
standards.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
for
a
slippery
floor
the
secretary's
only
requirement
--
well,
really
twofold
requirements.
one
is
the
second
and
third
sentences
of
section
6(b)(5).
mr.
william
h.
alsup
those
are
procedural,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
as
long
as
the
standard
is
something
that
a
court
could
find
to
rationally
advance
the
purposes
of
the
act,
and
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
promulgate
that
rule.
now,
that's
in
connection
with
safe
work
practice
type
regulations.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no,
there's
a
separate
law
that
covers
coal
mining.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
you
know,
there
is
somewhat
similar
language
in
the
coal
mining
safety
act.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
mr.
justice,
we
don't
contend
that
we
would
shut
down
industries.
i'd
like
to
root
that
out
right
now.
we
do
not
contend
that
we
would
take
a
standard
to
construe
"feasible"
to
the
point
where
we
would
shut
down
an
entire
industry.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
marginal
employers.
marginal
employers
who
were
surviving
because
they
are
able
to
survive
because
they
don't
give
their
employees
the
kind
of
health
protection
they
deserve.
that's
specifically
what
this
statute
was
designed
to
prohibit.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
but,
mr.
justice,
we
don't
contend
that
absolute
protection
can
ever
be
achieved
under
the
act.
we
simply
say
feasible
protection
can
be
achieved
under
the
act.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
i
don't
want
--
the
word
"appreciable"
has
gotten
a
bad
lead
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
what
i
meant
by
that
was
that
it
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i'll
explain
that.
it
rationally
advances
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
it
has
to
have
a
benefit.
it
has
to
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
yes.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
several
points.
first
of
all,
the
secretary
concluded
that
there
is
at
least
general
agreement
among
scientists
that
there
is
a
dose-response
relationship.
that
means
that
less
exposure
to
benzene
is
better
than
higher
exposure
to
benzene,
and
that
by
reducing
the
standard
from
ten
parts
per
million
to
one
part
per
million
there
would
be
a
benefit.
even
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
they
were
convinced
there
would
be
some
health
benefit
by
going
from
ten
parts
per
million
to
one
part
per
million.
in
addition,
there
are
many
cases
and
studies
in
the
record
which
show
that
even
at
levels
as
low
as
two
to
25
parts
per
million,
people
have
died
of
benzene
exposure
to
leukemia.
take
a
look
at
exhibit
154
in
this
connection,
which
is
a
study
by
dow
chemical
company
which
showed
that
for
three
employees
exposed
at
levels
between
two
and
nine
parts
per
million,
there
was
a
statistically
significant
increase
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
the
level
that
is
permitted
in
this
case
is
not
a
safe
level.
it
is,
however,
the
lowest
feasible
level
that
could
be
achieved.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
we
would
say
that
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
clear
evidence
that
the
--
in
the
rule-making
proceeding
--
that
the
standard
will
not
promote
the
purposes
of
the
act
in
a
broad
rational
basis
sense,
that
a
court
could
say
the
decision
to
issue
that
standard
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
not
under
the
test
that
the
fifth
circuit
used.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
have
to
agree.
under
a
rational
basis
test
there
could
be
a
very
limited
amount
of
balancing,
but
not
the
kind
of
balancing
that
calls
for
quantifiable
benefits
or
the
rational,
reasonable
relationship
test
that
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
now,
that's
a
question
of
priority
settings.
let's
be
sure
we
understand
the
hypothetical.
let's
say
that
there
are
several
very
serious
carcinogens
that
people
are
asking
the
secretary
to
regulate.
and
instead
he
postpones
that
momentarily
to
take
on
another
carcinogen.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
and
that
is
a
decision
on
how
to
allocate
the
internal
resources
of
the
agency
and
i
don't
think
it's
reviewable.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no,
that
decision
is
not
reviewable.
but
once
the
secretary
decides
to
issue
a
standard,
it
may
be
that
that
decision
itself
to
issue
a
standard
is
reviewable
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
under
the
arbitrary
and
capriciousness
standard.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
not
on
the
comparative
need
but
on
the
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
the
decision
is
to
attack
which
problem
to
attack
first
is
not
a
reviewable
decision.
however,
once
a
decision
and
standard
is
issued,
pursuant
to
decision
to
regulate
a
particular
area,
we
think
that
the
court
reviewing
that
could
step
back
and
say
was
it
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
issue
this
standard?
mr.
william
h.
alsup
in
that
review
the
court
has
never
required,
under
the
arbitrary
and
capriciousness
test,
that
any
agency
come
up
with
quantifiable
benefits.
all
we're
asking
for
is
the
same
sort
of
deference
that
the
courts
have
traditionally
given
to
agencies
and
decisions
to
issue
regulations.
now,
we
would
have
to
meet
--
a
separate
question
is
whether
or
not
we
would
meet
the
first
sentence
of
6(b)(5)
granted.
but
on
the
threshold
question
of
whether
to
issue
the
standard
at
all,
at
most
the
arbitrary
and
capriciousness
standard
of
review
would
apply.
and
that
does
not
call
for
quantifiable
benefits.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
yes,
and
we
do
that.
we
do
that
by
saying
to
the
court
your
honor,
scientists
and
medical
expert
after
medical
expert
came
in
and
said
benzene
is
a
carcinogen,
it
kills
employees
no
safe
level
is
known
and
the
prudent
thing
to
do
is
to
take
it
to
the
lowest
feasible
level.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
that
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
rational
basis
test
for
arbitrary
and
capriciousness
standard
of
review.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
i
don't
know
whether
the
secretary
has
thought
about
that
particular
problem.
but
if
the
secretary
were
to
conduct
rule-making
proceedings
and
if
scientists
and
doctors,
physicians
were
to
come
in
and
testify
that
smoking
by
other
persons
in
a
work
place
causes
a
health
threat
to
the
other
employees
working
in
that
work
place,
and
that
cigarette
smoking
should
be
banned,
this
statute
clearly
would
give
the
secretary
the
authority
to
issue
a
rule
which
would
limit
or
prohibit
smoking
altogether.
we
think
it
would
be
feasible
to
do
that.
unless
it
could
be
shown,
for
some
reason,
that
that
is
necessary,
and
i
think
that
would
be
very
unlikely
necessary
to
continue
the
business.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
i
would
like
to
take
five
minutes.
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
focus
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
that's
fine
i
won't
have
any,
then.
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
understand
the
facts
of
this
case
because
the
facts
of
this
case
have
somehow
been
forgotten
and
it's
been
elevated
to
hyperbole
and
extreme
hypotheticals
that
have
not
occurred
in
this
case
and
are
unlikely
to
occur
in
the
future.
here
is
what
the
secretary
found,
and
these
conclusions
are
based
on
substantial
evidence.
first,
benzene
causes
cancer,
it
causes
leukemia.
there
are
hundreds
of
deaths
reported
in
the
record
where
people
are
dying
from
leukemia
where
the
doctor
attributed
it
to
benzene.
it
causes
aplastic
anemia,
which
is
fatal
it's
a
blood
disease.
and
it
causes
chromosonal
damage.
respondents
do
not
dispute
these
findings.
now,
then,
the
second
inquiry
came
along
because
industry
witnesses
or
some
of
them
said,
well,
maybe
there
is
a
safe
threshold
of
exposure.
we're
already
at
ten
parts
per
million,
maybe
that's
already
safe.
extensive
evidence
was
taken
on
that
point.
and
a
lot
of
negative
studies
were
presented
by
industry
which
were
found
to
have
serious
epidemiological
flaws,
and,
in
addition,
scientist
after
scientist
testified
that
no
safe
level
for
exposure
to
benzene
could
yet
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
best
available
evidence.
that
is
also
a
conclusion
the
secretary
adopted,
and
that's
based
on
substantial
evidence.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
there
is.
there
are
--
in
the
dow
chemical
company
study,
for
example,
let
me
give
you
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
in
that
connection,
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
think
the
fifth
court
is
wrong
on
that.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
we
disagree
with
that,
and
let
me
direct
your
attention
to
exhibit
154
and
the
secretary's
discussion
of
that
dow
chemical
study.
it
was
a
study
in
which
three
employees
at
exposed
levels
of
between
two
parts
per
million
and
nine
parts
per
million
over
various
durations
died
from
leukemia,
at
a
time
when
only.8
persons
should
have
died
from
leukemia
in
that
population.
now,
our
reply
brief
says
that
was
not
statistically
significant.
we
were
wrong.
it
was
statistically
significant,
and
the
report
so
states.
now,
i
should
say
the
dow
chemical
doctor
said,
well,
there
are
flaws
in
our
study,
we
can't
really
be
sure
that
there
was
a
causal
nexus.
nonetheless,
there
is
a
concrete
example
where,
at
least
statistically
significant
evidence,
such
as
the
type
that
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
want,
showed
that
there
was
a
risk
at
those
low
levels
of
exposure.
in
addition,
the
stallone
study,
which
was
actually
one
of
the
negative
studies
that
was
presented
by
industry,
in
which
is
also
showed
an
excess
risk
of
leukemia,
something
like
21
versus
20
that
should
have
occurred,
that
one
was
not
statistically
significant,
but,
nonetheless,
there
is
evidence
that
there
is
an
excess
risk.
those
levels
were
down
around
two
parts
per
million.
it's
unclear
exactly
what
the
risk
--
the
exposure
levels
were,
but
it
was
in
the
refining
industry,
where
those
companies
are
already
at
or
almost
below
the
one
part
per
million
standard
now.
in
addition,
there
was
scientific
testimony
that
there
is,
in
general,
a
dose-response
relationship
--
that
means
less
exposure
to
carcinogens
is
better.
and
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
requires
that
we
protect
employees
or
the
secretary
protects
employees,
even
if
they
work
40
or
45
years
in
that
industry.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
that's
not
quite
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
that's
almost
correct.
what
the
secretary
said
was
that
no
safe
level
could
be
identified
on
the
basis
of
the
best
available
--
nothing
that
we
could
say
"this
is
a
safe
level".
mr.
william
h.
alsup
the
secretary
did,
however,
say,
and
relied
on
the
dow
chemical
study
as
evidence
that
is
consistent
with
the
possibility
that
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
--
there
is
a
risk
at
those
low
levels.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
he
did
not
make
a
finding
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that's
correct.
we
do
not
rely
upon
being
able
to
go
out
and
perform
studies
which
show
that
at
these
low
levels
you
are
always
going
to
be
able
to
prove
the
risk.
the
important
thing
about
this
case,
mr.
justice,
is
that
that
can't
be
done
for
carcinogens,
for
most
carcinogens,
for
some
it
can.
for
benzene,
the
data
is
just
not
there.
and
if
this
court
adopts
a
rule
that
says
you
have
to
show
quantifiable
benefits
at
these
low
levels,
then
the
secretary
is
going
to
be
disabled
from
acting
to
protect
workers
against
carcinogens
in
a
whole
host
of
areas.
because
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no,
that
would
be
less
feasible.
that
might
be
less
feasible
in
these
industries
where
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
to
tell
an
employee
that
he
can
only
work
in
this
industry
for
one
year,
i
think
that's
not
acceptable.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
many
employees
are
exposed.
they
can't
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
admit,
in
some
cases
it's
possible
to
rotate
employees.
that
is
not
a
satisfactory
answer
for
all
the
employees
exposed
to
benzene.
it's
a
daily
occurrence
in
their
work.
