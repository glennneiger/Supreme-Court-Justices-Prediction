justice
potter
stewart
part
of
the
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
if
this
stand
is
not
reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate,
then
even
if
it's
--
then
it
is
not
permitted
by
the
statute
even
if
it's
feasible
to
the
new
standard.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
just
differ
on
the
meaning
of
"reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate".
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
let
me
ask
you
my
second
question.
you
place
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
in
your
brief
on
the
fact
that
this
is
toxic
materials
standards,
and
that
the
feasibility
is
the
only
test
you
have
to
meet
basically
in
a
toxic
materials
area.
but
what
if
this
were
a
regular
work
practice
rule,
what
would
be
the
guideline
that
the
agency
would
follow
there?
there's
nothing
else
in
the
statute
that
i
can
find
that
provides
a
different
standard
for
work
practice
rules
than
the
one
it
provides
for
toxic
materials.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
like
slippery
floors
or
something
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
any
regulation
that
may
produce
an
appreciable
safety
benefit
is
authorized
by
this
act.
justice
potter
stewart
is
coal
mining
covered
by
this
act?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
you
couldn't
apply
that,
the
sentence
you
rely
primarily
on,
to
the
coal
industry
without
shutting
it
down,
could
you?
justice
potter
stewart
has
it
been
so
construed?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
the
entire
industry,
but
perhaps
the
coal
industry
might
be
different.
but
you
have
agreed
that
the
secretary
could
adopt
standards
which
shut
down
segments
of
an
industry.
justice
potter
stewart
it
depends
on
whether
health
protection
ever
can
be
absolute
in
terms
of
protecting
against
all
of
the
hazards
of
this
life,
particularly
in
certain
employment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
about
the
level
that
is
permitted
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
do
say
that
--
well,
i
guess
you
would
say
the
decision
to
issue
a
standard
is
always
reviewable?
justice
potter
stewart
the
balancing
would
go
to
which
hazard
to
attack?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
you
had
a
regulation
attacking
some
kind
of
hazard
that
everybody
agreed
was
very
minor
compared
to
20
other
much
more
threatening
hazards,
that
the
secretary
hadn't
attacked
at
all.
would
that
be
a
legitimate
inquiry?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
just
postpones
it,
we
don't
know
if
it's
momentarily
or
not.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
reviewable?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
do
you
think
there's
any
room
for
inquiry
into
the
comparative
need
for
it?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
he
issues
a
standard
attacking
mice
or
rate
feces
in
a
factory,
in
factories
around
the
country,
and
it's
shown
that
that's
not
good
and
it's
harmful,
but
compared
to
all
sorts
of
twenty
other
different
harmful
environmental
conditions
and
carcinogens
and
poisons
and
what
not,
that
it's
miniscule,
it
just
isn't
that
an
appropriate
subject
for
judicial
inquiry
in
reviewing
the
standard,
or
the
decision
by
the
secretary
to
attack
one
problem
and
not
others.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
alsup,
this
is
--
you're
bringing
in
really
a
different
argument
than
you
made
in
your
reply
brief.
you're
now
contending
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
pertaining
to
the
area
between
one
and
ten
parts
per
million.
but
i
do
not
understand
that
the
secretary
relied
on
any
such
evidence,
but,
rather,
he
assumed
that
we
didn't
know
the
answer
in
that
area,
but
there
may
be
a
danger,
and
the
"may
be"
was
enough.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
would
be
some
risk
in
this
area.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
don't
think
he
really
made
a
finding
that
the
evidence
establishes
a
risk
in
this
area,
i
think
his
--
at
least
i
certainly
didn't
read
him
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
didn't
understand
your
brief
to
rely
on
that,
and
us
looking
into
the
background
to
see
if
there's
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
are
other
things
he
could
do
besides
banning
it
or
cutting
it
down,
for
example
you
could
make
a
big
point
--
or
i
guess
that's
your
colleague,
making
a
big
point
about
whether
workers
exposed
for
a
full
lifetime
or
just
periodically
would
make
a
big
difference.
maybe
you
could
just
say
they
could
only
work
for
a
year
in
these
exposed
areas,
or
something
like
that.
that
would
be
something
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
less
feasible
to
give
temporary
assignments
than
to
spend
a
half
billion
dollars?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
particular
exposed
areas.
justice
potter
stewart
thirty
thousand.
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
may,
just
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
last
one,
and
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
answer
to
my
brother
rehnquist
but
it's
your
submission,
therefore,
that
even
if
the
answer
to
this
question,
what
happens
to
employees
exposed
to
10
ppm
of
benzene,
and
even
if
the
answer
to
that
question
turns
out
to
be
nothing
happens
to
them
at
all,
nothing
nonetheless,
this
is
a
perfectly
and
completely
valid
regulation.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
point
is
we
don't
know,
and
it's
even.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
if
we
don't
know,
it's
possible
--
if
we
don't
know,
then
it's
certainly
possible
that
the
answer
is
nothing.
justice
potter
stewart
potentially
zero
consequences.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you
don't
know,
you
don't
know.
and
then
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
this
would
be
true
of
any
environmental
ingredient.
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
because
anything
used
to
excess
can
be
harmful,
including
drinking
water.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
twenty
years,
twenty-five
years
after
the
discovery
of
what
they
thought
was
the
answer
to
many
diseases,
namely
cortisone,
they
now
discover
it
isn't.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
justice
rehnquist
has
an
outstanding
question.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
an
industry
practice
of
reducing
it
to
10
ppm,
wasn't
there?
wasn't
that
how
it
went?
justice
potter
stewart
the
10
ppm.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
in
any
way
attacking
that,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
everybody
agrees
that
wouldn't
be
feasible.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
warren,
can
i
ask
you,
if
you
believe
the
secretary's
authority
with
respect
to
--
i'm
not
talking
about
his
duty
but
his
authority
--
with
respect
to
standards
concerning
toxic
materials
is
any
different
from
his
authority
with
respect
to
work
practices,
such
as
cleaning
floors
and
the
like?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
he
would
have
authority
in
a
different,
as
justice
stewart
suggested,
cleaning
floors
or
something,
if
a
certain
cleaning
practice
wasn't
followed
there
might
be
a
risk
of
people
slipping
and
killing
themselves.
he'd
have
authority
to
change
that
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
warren,
there's
another
issue
in
this
case,
the
dermal
issue
or
the
protective
clothing
issue,
that
i
think
your
brothers
didn't
talk
about.
justice
potter
stewart
he's
going
to
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
a
fair
statement
of
their
position.
their
position
is
that
by
extrapolating
here
you
can
reasonably
conclude
that
there
may
be
an
appreciable
risk
of
harm
here.
and
the
agency
so
found.
there
may
be
a
harm
that's
their
position,
and
that's
enough.
that's
not
like
saying
we
don't
know
--
i
mean
that
there
is
no
harm.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
your
position
was
that
will
in
effect
admit
that
there
may
be
an
appreciable
harm
but
that's
not
enough.
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
you
willing
to
admit
that
there's
a
possibility
of
an
appreciable
harm?
justice
potter
stewart
that
may
be
a
possibility.
justice
potter
stewart
so
we've
got
to
start
from
the
assumption,
i
think,
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
somebody
may
die
of
cancer
if
we
set
aside
these
regulations.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
exposure
to
this
substance
at
less
than
10
parts
per
million.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
win
this
case,
somebody
may
die
as
a
result
of
it.
we
have
to
start
with
that
assumption.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we've
got
to
be
realistic.
[laughter]
