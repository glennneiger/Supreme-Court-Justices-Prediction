mr.
edward
w.
warren
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
how
does
one
do
that?
mr.
edward
w.
warren
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
allotted
35
minutes
to
argue
the
main
issue
presented
by
the
decision
below
my
colleague,
mr.
lettow,
will
argue
for
ten
minutes
exclusively
on
the
dermal
exposure
issue.
but
this
case
is
far
simpler,
i
believe,
than
my
opponents
have
made
it
appear.
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
--
that
osha
must
shoulder
the
affirmative
burden
of
showing,
by
substantial
evidence,
that
its
standard
is
reasonably
necessary
and
otherwise
complies
with
the
act.
here
osha
failed
to
show
that
the
standard
would
do
any
discernible
good,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
decision
and
the
result
reached
by
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
congress
wanted
osha
to
issue
standards
that
are
reasonably
necessary
to
protect
workers.
my
opponent,
mr.
alsup,
has
suggested
that
that
provision
is
nothing
more
than
a
broad
enabling
statute
--
broad
enabling
provision.
but,
in
fact,
there
is
in
this
very
statute
enabling
language
in
another
provision
which
says
--
this
is
section
8(g)(2)
which
says
that
osha
may
issue
such
rules
and
regulations
as
he
may
deem
necessary.
i
don't
believe,
when
congress
has
so
clearly
used
enabling
type
language,
one
can
construe
a
reference,
such
as
in
3(8)
as
an
enabling
provision.
quite
the
contrary.
the
term
"reasonably
necessary"
has
consistently
and
uniformly
been
construed
by
the
court,
first
circuit,
in
the
bean
case
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
aqua
slide
case,
to
be
fully
consistent
with
what
this
court
held
in
the
benzene
case.
now,
the
purpose
that
congress
wanted
osha
to
follow,
namely,
to
set
reasonably
necessary
standards,
is
carried
forward
in
section
6(b)(5).
that
provision
intends
for
the
secretary
to
set
feasible
standards
which,
the
legislative
history
shows,
were
to
encompass
reasonable
and
practical
steps,
to
control
material
health
hazards.
such
standards
are
also
to
be
based
not
on
views
evidenced
in
arguments,
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history,
or
some
legislative
history
about
this
but
instead
on
substantial
evidence
and
the
best-available
evidence.
the
fifth
circuit
--
and
in
each
of
these
instances,
the
determinations
on
these
issues
are
required
by
the
statute
to
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
fifth
circuit,
in
light
of
these
provisions,
held
essentially
two
things
it
held
that
osha
must
show
that
its
standard
will
produce
discernible
benefits
and,
secondly,
that
there
is
some
reasonable
relationship
between
the
benefits
expected
and
the
cost
of
the
standard.
my
opponents
have
both
mentioned
that
there
are,
as
mr.
alsup
said,
thousands
of
carcinogens
in
the
work
place,
i
believe
he
said,
and
mr.
cohen
noted
the
congress
envisioned
every
twenty
seconds
a
new
chemical
going
into
the
work
place.
now,
it's
our
position
that
the
statute
expected
osha
to
be
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
and
that
if
the
over-all
aims
of
the
statute,
which
are
to
protect
workers,
are
going
to
be
achieved,
they
can
only
be
achieved
if
there
is
a
judgment
made
that
each
individual
standard
is
going
to
accomplish
some
discernible
good,
and
is
going
to
benefit
the
worker,
because
obviously
unless
that
sort
of
determination,
that
sort
of
reasonableness
determination
is
made
with
every
standard
in
the
first
instance,
what
you're
going
to
find
is,
ten
years
from
now,
industry
will
have
spent
fortunes
to
control
what
could
turn
out
to
be
de
minimis,
or
hazards
which
really
are
not
terribly
significant.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
let's
--
i
think
the
key
to
that
question
is
what
does
best-available
evidence
mean?
but
let's
first
try
to
answer
the
question,
were
there
discernible
benefits
here?
we've
talked
a
lot
back
and
forth
about
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
evidence
under
a
hundred
parts
per
million
--
and
i
say
a
hundred
parts
per
million
because
there's
really
no
evidence
below
a
hundred
parts
per
million
--
as
mr.
justice
stevens
noted,
the
fifth
circuit
said
there
was
no
empirical
evidence
below
ten.
my
opponents
have
brought
up
the
dow
study.
i
felt
that
with
their
reply
brief
we
had
seen
the
end
of
last-minute
ex
post
facto
rationalizations
of
counsel,
but
we
have
yet
a
new
study
brought
on
the
scene.
and
i
just
call
your
attention
to
page
15
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
epa's
interpretation
of
that
study.
it
says
that
the
ott
study,
that's
the
dow
study,
indicated
no
excess
risk
of
leukemia
with
relatively
well-documented
exposures.
i
cross-examined
the
witnesses
for
dow
in
the
proceeding,
and
i
will
tell
you
that
there
is
evidence
that
some
of
the
exposures
in
that
instance
were
up
in
several
hundred
parts
per
million.
they
varied
all
over
the
lot.
there
were
different
groups
of
workers
exposed
to
different
amounts.
i
don't
believe
i've
really
answered
your
question,
though,
because,
coming
back
to
the
question
of
discernible
benefits,
we
feel
that
here
there
are
no
demonstrated
benefits
whatsoever.
there
is
no
empirical
evidence
of
any
harm
under
a
hundred
parts
per
million.
now,
the
question
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
it's
not
an
industry
practice,
it's
a
consensus
standard,
and
the
consensus
standard
has
the
effect
of
law.
it
is
law.
it
was
adopted
without
rule-making
pursuant
to
section
6(a)
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
and
it's
been
in
effect
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no,
we're
not
attacking
that.
in
fact,
we
think
that
standard
is
providing
fully
adequate
protection
to
the
workers.
coming
to
the
question
of
whether
those
benefits
ought
to
be
quantifiable
or
not,
our
position
on
that
issue
is
that
it's
controlled
by
what
the
best-available
evidence
is.
now,
in
this
instance,
you'll
recall
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
did
quantify
the
benefit,
was
able
to
make
estimates
of
what
the
standard
would
accomplish.
the
same
was
true
of
dr.
wilson,
epa's
own
contractor
in
this
case,
who
testified
that
it
could
conduct
a
cost-effectiveness
type
analysis
which
would
encompass
some
sort
of
estimate
of
this
type.
the
fifth
circuit
noted
that
in
its
decision
and
was
fully
aware
of
the
capability
in
this
regard.
so
i
think
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
best-available
evidence
language
is
controlling
with
respect
to
the
degree
to
which
quantification
can
occur
but
i
think
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
in
this
case
that
such
quantification
can
indeed
be
done,
because
it
was
done
by
epa's
sister
agency,
the
environmental
protection
agency.
now,
the
important
thing,
i
think,
here
is
that
if
you
carefully
analyze
what
the
fifth
circuit
said,
it
boils
down
to
really
three
things.
it
says,
first
of
all,
that
the
agency
must
carefully
consider
and
address
any
evidence
on
benefits
submitted
by
the
parties.
secondly,
it
should
attempt
to
estimate,
as
well
as
possible,
what
the
standard
is
intended
to
accomplish.
and
third,
it
ought
to
explain
and
justify
the
standard
which
it
ultimately
promulgates
in
terms
of
what
it
is
expected
to
accomplish.
what
is
this
going
to
accomplish
for
the
worker?
now,
i
submit
that
no
one
can
seriously
contend
that
that
was
done
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
any
of
those
things
was
done
in
this
case.
it's
probably
the
best
evidence,
perhaps,
that
this
wasn't
done
in
this
case
is
that
the
secretary
has
felt
called
upon
to
submit
a
very
lengthy
addendum
to
its
reply
brief,
which
sets
forth
what
i
think
it
wishes
it
had
said
but
didn't
say
about
benefits
in
this
case.
to
me
this
tests
the
limits
of
what
the
ex
post
facto
rationalization
of
counsel
doctrine
must
mean.
this
takes
it
awfully,
awfully
far.
now,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
a
question
earlier
about
how
feasibility
was
determined
in
this
case.
i
think
that
bears
a
short
discussion,
because
here's
what
happened.
the
secretary
said,
we
have
a
health
hazard
here,
and
the
secretary
said
to
the
contractor,
not
should
we
set
a
standard
at
one
or
five
or
ten,
and
what's
feasible,
or
even
one-half
what
he
said
is,
we're
talking
about
a
one
part
per
million
standard,
can
you
go
out
and
show
us
that
industry
can
come
up
with
the
hardware
to
accomplish
this,
and
that
it
won't
drive
the
industry
out
of
business,
or
it
won't
require
the
industry
to
be
shut
down?
that's
all
that
happened
in
this
case.
there
was
no
consideration
of
alternatives.
the
contractor
was
given
no
discretion
to
look
at
any
of
the
questions
which
we're
talking
about
here
today.
it
is
for
that
very
reason,
of
course,
that
we
presented
evidence
and
discussed
this
question
at
length
in
the
hearings.
the
kind
of
evidence
we
presented
--
and
i
might
add
that
the
council
on
wage
and
price
stability
was
weighing
in
there
on
exactly
the
same
basis
--
was
that
this
statute
is
sufficiently
flexible
to
permit
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
fifth
circuit
said.
we're
not
talking
about
elaborate
cost-benefit
analyses,
what
we're
talking
about
is
reasoned,
rational
decision-making
in
a
situation
where
congress
wanted
ultimately
the
most
protection
for
workers
to
be
accomplished.
but
that
can't
be
accomplished
by
taking
a
tunnel
vision
approach
as
was
taken
in
this
case
to
one
hazard,
and
a
hazard,
indeed,
where
the
evidence
strongly
suggests
we
don't
have
nearly
as
great
a
problem
as
we've
had
with
others,
and
will
probably
have
with
others
in
the
future.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
think
that
of
course
adequate
protection
could
be
accomplished
by
banning
carcinogens,
but
the
problem
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes,
that
wouldn't
be
feasible,
it
wouldn't
--
it
just
is
an
affront
to
common
sense,
and
i
don't
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
congress
definitely
ruled
that
out.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
it
puts
the
word
"feasible"
in.
now
we
have
to
ask
what
was
"feasible"
intended
to
accomplish?
let
me
talk
about
the
legislative
history
for
a
minute,
because
i
think
there
are
two
key
points
on
the
legislative
history
which
tell
us
that
congress
wanted
that
term
"feasible"
to
mean
reasonable
and
practical.
things
that
are
really
very
consistent
with
section
3(8),
the
"reasonably
necessary"
language.
first,
senator
javits
was
the
author
of
the
original
administration
bill
on
occupational
health
and
safety.
it
was
submitted
in
1969.
that
bill
provided
for
standards
to
be
set
by
an
independent
board
and
the
standards
would
be
set
based
upon
a
report
regarding
the
standard's
feasibility,
which
the
statute
says
in
so
many
words
would
include
reasonableness,
practicality
and
technical
feasibility.
now,
senator
javits
was
the
principal
proponent
of
the
feasibility
amendment.
he
added
it
as
an
amendment
in
the
senate
committee.
it
is
reasonable
--
it
is
unreasonable
in
fact
to
assume
anything
else
--
that
when
senator
javits
put
that
"feasibility"
word
in
there,
that
is
precisely
what
he
meant.
he
did
not
mean
this
to
mean
some
sort
of
arbitrary
business
shutdown
criterion.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
i
think
what
he
meant
was
that
the
standard
ultimately
--
it's
the
ultimate
objective
we're
talking
about,
the
standard
should
be
reasonably
necessary.
i
think
that's
consistent
with
saying
that
it
should
be
--
protect
the
worker
to
the
extent
feasible.
now,
the
ultimate
objective
is
that
the
standard
be
reasonable,
the
standard
be
practical.
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
doing
is
telling
us
how
that
objective
can
be
achieved.
how
that
goal
of
reasonably
necessary
standards,
how
that
goal
of
reasonable
and
practical
standard
can
be
achieved.
it's
saying,
first
of
all,
that
the
agency
must
show
some
discernible
benefit
and,
secondly,
that
there
must
be
some
reasonable
relationship
between
the
costs
and
the
benefit.
and
it's
giving
us
a
means
of
doing
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
whole
approach
is
strongly
supported
also
by
the
evidentiary
requirement,
including
the
substantial
evidence
test.
congress
put
the
substantial
evidence
test
in
for
a
very
clear
and
important
purpose,
i
think.
congress
was
concerned
that
the
secretary
of
labor
would
issue
arbitrary,
unreasonable,
unexplained,
unsupportable
standards.
some
of
the
original
bills
had
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
review
standard
in
them.
that
was
felt
by
members
in
the
house
to
be
insufficient
protection.
it
was
changed
in
the
senate
to
provide
additional
protection
through
the
substantial
evidence
test.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
the
--
the
feeling
was
that
in
return
for
letting
the
secretary
of
labor
establish
the
standards,
that
there
needed
to
be
guarantees
so
that
the
secretary
of
labor
would
not
go
overboard.
that's
what
i
believe
the
substantial
evidence
test
was
for
in
this
instance.
i
make
the
same
point
to
the
second
and
third
sentences
of
section
6(b)(5),
which,
incidentally
mr.
alsup,
contrary
to
his
opening
brief,
now
appears
to
concede,
apply
to
both
health
and
safety
standards.
those
provisions
were
put
into
the
statute
in
response
to
the
concern
stated
in
the
house
by
the
house
minority
members
who
had,
i
think,
an
immense
power
in
this
legislative
debate.
the
house
originally
passed
the
daniels
bill.
the
daniels
bill
was
thought
by
the
minority
members
to
be
too
oriented
towards
the
labor
point
of
view.
they
ultimately
passed
through
the
house
the
staggers-sikes
substitute,
which
was
the
new
administration
bill.
in
any
event,
the
house
minority
members
criticized
the
daniels
bill
as
allowing
standards
to
be
set
on
the
basis
of
views
and
argument.
in
the
senate
that
was
remedied
by
including
the
second
and
third
sentences
of
section
6(b)(5).
those
provisions
require
that
standards
be
based
on
research
demonstration
and
experiments.
it
requires
that
in
addition
to
the
health
and
safety
protection,
that
the
agency
consider
the
latest
scientific
data
in
the
field
and
the
experience
of
other
health
and
safety
agencies.
we
think
the
experience
of
other
health
and
safety
agencies
is
very
significant
in
this
case,
too.
we
called,
throughout
the
proceedings,
to
the
secretary's
attention
the
fact
that
other
agencies,
and
i
include
epa
as
a
prime
example,
were
making
the
very
kind
of
estimates
of
benefits
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
that
was
never
addressed
in
their
decision.
that
point
is
still,
i
think,
unaddressed
by
the
agency.
why
epa
can
engage
in
the
kind
of
exercise
that
the
fifth
circuit
contemplated
and
this
agency
can't
is
absolutely
beyond
any
understanding,
as
far
as
i
can
see.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
i
think
there
are
differences
which
reflect
only
one
thing.
the
reasonably
necessary
clause
applies
to
both.
the
first
sentence
of
section
6(b)(5)
applies
only
to
toxic
substances.
the
second
and
third
sentences
of
section
6(b)(5)
apply
to
both
health
and
safety
standards.
the
third
sentence
of
6(b)(5)
mentions
feasibility,
so
that
i
think
safety
standards
comprehend
feasibility.
but
i
do
think
there's
a
difference,
and
i
think
that
difference
is
why
the
debate
arose
and
why
there
is
a
separate
provision,
and
that
is,
section
2(b)(6)
recognizes
that
there
are
differences
in
toxic
substances
because
there
are
the
problems
that
mr.
cohen
was
referring
to,
the
problems
of
determination
of
cause
and
effect
relationships
and
determinations
of
latency
period.
i
don't
think
that
congress
wanted
any
different,
you
know,
level
of
stringency
of
protection.
but
i
do
think
that
congress
wanted
the
agency
to
recognize,
and
i
think
the
language
of
the
first
sentence
of
section
6(b)(5)
does
this,
however
inartfully,
that
there
were
going
to
be
somewhat
different
problems
presented.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
think
that
the
two
are
really
the
same.
if
you
ask
me,
at
the
level
of
stringency,
i
think
they
come
out
the
same,
frankly.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
and
i
think
in
coal
mining,
although
it's
not
covered
by
the
statute,
is
an
example,
too.
there
are
going
to
be
industries
where
it's
very
dangerous
work
in
those
industries,
if
you're
working
on
tall
buildings
or
construction
projects,
obviously
it's
a
terribly,
terribly
dangerous
thing
to
do.
and
i
think
the
secretary
should
be
equally
concerned
about
those
hazards.
i
think
congress
was
equally
concerned
about
those
hazards,
really,
because
the
legislative
history
reveals
a
discussion
of,
i
think
it
was,
14,000
deaths
a
year
and
some
600,000
injuries.
and
most
of
those
obviously
are
related
to
health
and
safety
problems,
related
to
construction
accidents
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
so
i
think
that,
in
terms
of
the
level
of
stringency,
we
should
be
coming
out
about
the
same
place.
i
think
it's
significant,
though,
once
again,
to
point
out
that
the
secretary's
opening
brief
seemed
to
pin
almost
its
entire
case
upon
some
distinction
between
toxic
substances
and
safety
standards,
and
now
i
think
they
concede,
if
i
understand
mr.
alsup
correctly,
that
safety
standards
are
covered
by
the
second
and
third
sentences
of
section
5(b)(5),
and
it
seems
to
me
the
reference
to
feasibility
there
must
mean
that
we're
talking
about
roughly
comparable
levels
of
stringency.
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
substantial
evidence
test
without
a
little
more
discussion,
because
i
think
that
is
so
critical
to
the
case.
we
must
remember
we
don't
have
any
evidence
here
of
actual
problems
below
100
parts
per
million.
now,
it's
important
to
recognize
that
industry
in
this
case
has
looked,
and
looked
very
hard,
to
discover
whether
there
are
any
problems.
there
have
been
numerous
epidemiological
studies
covering
tens
of
thousands
of
workers.
to
be
sure,
the
secretary
has
faulted
the
methodology
of
some
of
those
studies,
but
every
epidemiological
study
has
the
same
problems,
including
the
ones
they
are
relying
on.
the
studies
we
are
talking
about
have
been
relied
on
by,
for
instance,
the
national
academy
of
sciences,
who
felt
that
the
thorpe
study
which
was
done
by
the
petroleum
industry
showed
there
just
couldn't
be
any
significant
problem
there,
regardless
of
any
minor
methodological
defects.
you
just
couldn't
have
a
big
problem,
there
just
isn't
a
big
problem
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no,
your
honor,
this
is
a
very
different
case
than
the
asbestos
case.
the
asbestos
case
was
a
challenge
by
my
friend,
mr.
cohen,
here
to
the
asbestos
standard,
it
was
not
a
challenge
by
employers.
employers
didn't
participate
except
as
amici
in
that
case
at
all.
they
made
no
arguments,
such
as
i'm
making
here
today
nobody
raised
the
statutory
provisions
i'm
talking
about,
nobody
raised
the
issues
of
whether
or
not
there
were
benefits
to
justify
a
standard.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
they
did
find
it
was
bad.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
they
found
it
was
bad.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
they
found
it
was
bad
at
the
time.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
pardon?
mr.
edward
w.
warren
is
there
a
chance
that
it
might
happen
here?
mr.
edward
w.
warren
there's
always
a
chance
that
anything
can
happen,
and
i'm
not
saying
that
this
won't
happen.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
edward
w.
warren
the
answer
is
i
can't
say
that
it
will
not
happen.
but
i
can
give
you
some
pretty
good
reasons
why
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
going
to
happen.
the
reason
i
don't
believe
it's
going
to
happen
is
because
benzene
has
been
in
use
for
over
a
hundred
years.
this
is
a
substance
we
know
about
as
much
about
as
any
substance
we're
going
to
know
about.
there
have
been
workers
working
with
it
for
a
hundred
years.
there
have
been
lots
of
studies.
there
is
more
medical
literature
on
this
substance
than
just
about
any
one
i
know
anything
about.
and
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
find
anything
like
that.
i
might
add,
too,
that
the
asbestos
situation,
mr.
cohen
is
saying
that
it
was
not
shown
to
be
a
carcinogen
at
the
time
that
standard
was
passed.
that's
really
sort
of
an
exaggeration,
i
think.
it
was
shown
to
be
a
very,
very
serious
respiratory
problem-causing
mesothelioma
and
asbestosis.
everybody
has
known
this
has
been
a
significant
problem,
and
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
there's
no
harm
from
benzene
recorded
under
100
parts
per
million.
that's
true.
and
there's
been
a
lot
of
effort
to
find
harm.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
theoretical
construct,
really
we're
talking
about
a
substance
where
some
harm
has
been
demonstrated
at
high
levels
and
where
we're
theorizing
that
there
must
be
some
harm
at
lower
levels,
and
from
that
theory,
and
nothing
else,
the
secretary
is
constructing
an
argument,
which
is
unsupported
by
anything,
that
there
are
so-called
depreciable
benefits.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
you
can
say
this,
that
at
the
levels
such
as
dr.
aksoy
looked
at,
2,
3,
400
parts
per
million,
dr.
vigliani,
you
can
see
a
relationship
between
the
instance
of
leukemia
and
the
benzene
exposure.
on
the
other
hand,
when
we
look
below
that
level,
we
don't
see
anything.
there
certainly
is
a
theoretical
case.
there
were
witnesses
who
testified
to
that
theoretical
case
in
the
hearing
but
it
proves
too
much,
because
it
proves
that
something
that
can
be
proved
for
any
of
those
thousands
of
carcinogens
that
mr.
alsup
was
talking
about,
or
many
of
those
chemical
substances
which
are
introduced
into
the
work
place
every
20
minutes.
what
it
says
is
we
don't
have
any
way
of
distinguishing
all
of
those
chemicals.
but
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
trying
to
do
is
to
grapple
with
that
question
without
going
too
far.
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
trying
to
do
is
to
take
what
congress
did,
the
reasonably
necessary
provision
and
the
feasibility
provision
and
the
substantial
evidence
provision
and
the
best
available
evidence
provision,
and
it's
saying
this
much
they
must
do.
substantial
evidence
requires
this
much.
reasonableness,
reasonable
necessity
requires
this
much.
the
agency
cannot
carry
out
its
over-all
statutory
objective
unless
it
does
this
much.
it
didn't
do
those
things
here.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
mr.
lettow,
yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
in
conclusion,
i
think
it's
significant
that
workers
here
are
not
going
unprotected.
we
have
an
existing
10
parts
per
million
standard.
i
think
that's
providing
fully
adequate
protection.
what
the
secretary's
argument
boils
down
to
as
far
as
i
can
tell
is
a
plea
that
this
court
give
blind
deference
to
its
so-called
expertise.
as
i
understand
their
argument,
what
it
amounts
to
is
that
the
absence
of
any
evidence
supporting
their
position
is
really
a
factor
that
works
in
their
favor.
what
they're
saying
is
because
we
don't
have
any
evidence,
we're
free
to
do
whatever
we
want.
now,
maybe
i've
misinterpreted
them,
but
that's
the
way
i
read
their
position.
and
if
that's
the
position,
it
seems
to
me
that
neither
the
substantial
evidence
test
nor
judicial
review
of
standards
such
as
this
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
i
appreciate
what
you're
saying,
and
i
think
that
is
their
position.
what
their
position
is
is
that
we
don't
know,
and
so
therefore
we
can
extrapolate
--
without
trying
to
extrapolate
we
can
simply
say
there
are
appreciable
benefits.
it's
like
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no,
i
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
if
you
say
a
possibility
of
appreciable
harm,
yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
that's
right.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
we
accept
that.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
we
accept
that
there
is
some
possibility
of
appreciable
benefit.
what
we're
saying
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
wouldn't
put
it
quite
like
that,
but
i
would
think
--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
i
think
that
--
but
seriously,
i
think
we
would
say
that
there
is
some
possibility
of
the
appreciable
harm
you're
talking
about.
what
we're
talking
about,
though,
is
did
the
secretary
do
the
best
job
it
could,
given
the
best
available
evidence
to
look
at
this
problem?
we
say
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
epa
has
shown,
and
i
don't
think
there
can
be
a
better
demonstration,
that
the
agency
could
have
done
a
better
job
than
it
did
in
this
instance,
to
show
what
--
appreciable
harm,
what
does
that
mean?
it's
unexplained.
it
cries
out
for
meaning.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
very
fact
that
the
agency
said
it
suggests
that
they
must
recognize
that
they
can't
operate
with
utter
and
complete
freedom.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
that's
an
important
question,
i
think,
which
--
the
first
point
is
that
once
the
proceedings
begin
to
focus
in
on
what
i
think
is
the
real
question
what's
this
going
to
accomplish
for
the
worker?
i
think
we're
going
to
find
the
differences
between
sides
narrowing.
i
think
we're
going
to
find
people
beginning
to
agree
about
what's
useful
protection
and
what's
less
useful
protection.
i
don't
think
that
if
the
hypothetical
you
pose
were
to
occur
that
the
secretary
would
issue
this
standard.
i
really
don't
believe
that.
i
don't
believe
that,
in
light
of
the
other
standards
which
have
been
issued,
which
i
think
can
easily
be
demonstrated
and
indeed
have
been
demonstrated
to
produce
much
more
benefit
than
this,
i
just
don't
believe
this
would
occur.
there
may
come
a
time
when
the
secretary
does
something
as
flatly
unreasonable.
i
would
say
unreasonable
is
bad,
and
i
think
in
that
event
we
can
argue
about
it,
but
we'll
be
arguing
about
it
at
a
time
where
the
assumptions
on
both
sides
are
clearly
stated,
where
the
evidence
supporting
the
assumptions
on
both
sides
are
clearly
stated.
where
we
really
have
substantial
evidence
which
can
be
reviewed
on
both
sides
of
the
question.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
so
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
question
that
theoretically
arises,
but
i
don't
think
it
will
happen
in
the
real
world.
those
questions
are
going
to
be
resolved
rationally
and
reasonably
once
people
start
looking
at
what
really
matters.
and
what
really
matters
is
protecting
these
workers
that
mr.
cohen
and
i
both
would
like
to
protect.
thank
you.
