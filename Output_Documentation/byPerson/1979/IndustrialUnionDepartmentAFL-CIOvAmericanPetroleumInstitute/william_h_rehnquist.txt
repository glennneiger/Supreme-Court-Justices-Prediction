justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
describe
those
statutory
requirements?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
government's
position
on
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
government's
position
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
"if
feasible"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
congress
give
any
more
guidance
to
the
secretary
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
the
word
"if
feasible"
mean
in
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
achievable
in
what
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
almost
take
us
back
to
the
schacter
case
in
the
thirties,
where
congress
simply
turns
over
to
the
agency
the
job
of
making
legislation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
feasible.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
doesn't
define
the
word
"feasible".
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
legislation
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
within
the
capability
of
the
affected
industry
even
though
particular
enterprises
or
corporations
within
the
industry
might
fail
as
a
result
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
were
to
go
to
the
extent
where
no
employee
would
suffer,
he
would
simply
ban
the
use
of
benzene,
would
he
not?
because
there's
no
known
use
in
which
it's
safe.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
he
determine
that
it's
not
feasible?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
there
can
be
no
quantifiable
balancing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
you
concede
that
you
would
have
to
show
that
the
worker
would
be
better
off
under
this
standard
than
if
you
had
not
issued
this
kind
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
didn't
he
then
simply
ban
the
use
of
benzene?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
secretary
know
what
is
feasible
under
this
statutory
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
"industry"
i
understand
you
to
mean
an
entire
industry
in
the
sense
of
the
coke
processors,
or
the
oil
industry.
i
also
understand
that
the
secretary
considers
the
statute
to
authorize
him
to
impose
controls
which
would
make
it
impossible
for
a
particular
company
within
that
business
to
continue
to
do
business,
using
those
controls.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
all
of
what
you
say
makes
sense,
except
for
the
words
"if
feasible".
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
sound
to
me
as
if
congress
is
simply
completely
passing
the
buck
to
the
secretary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
remember,
either.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
a
critical
point
like
this,
where
we're
talking
about
the
extent
feasible,
why
should
we
have
to
look
to
vague
legislative
history
that
is
subject
to
ambiguous
construction
when
congress
could
have
said
either
this
or
that
or
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
form
of
that
protection
could
certainly
be
accomplished
by
simply
banning
carcinogens.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
congress,
by
putting
in
the
language
"if
feasible"
apparently
ruled
out
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
did
it
put
in
its
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that's
precisely
what
he
meant.
what
is
precisely
what
he
meant?
