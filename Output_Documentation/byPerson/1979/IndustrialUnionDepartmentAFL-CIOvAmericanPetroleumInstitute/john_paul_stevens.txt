you
now
say
that
balancing
is
contemplated
by
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
determining
which
industry
is
to
be
regulated?
in
selecting
the
industry.
once
you've
selected
the
industry
to
which
a
standard
is
to
be
applied,
is
balancing
then
permitted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
once
that
industry
is
selected
--
i'm
perhaps
not
understanding
you
--
may
the
secretary
then
consider
the
benefits
in
terms
of
being
beneficial
to
the
health
of
the
individuals
in
the
industry,
as
compared
with
the
cost?
your
brief
says
not,
as
i
remember
it.
the
state
simply
leaves
no
room
for
the
conclusion
that
the
secretary
must
balance
costs
against
benefits
in
setting
an
exposure
level.
now,
perhaps
by
balance
you
could
argue
about
what
that
means,
but
my
question
is
whether
the
secretary,
once
having
chosen
an
industry,
must
consider
whether
or
not
the
health
benefits
are
rational,
reasonable,
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
bear
any
relationship
whatever
to
the
expenditure
of
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
point
where
no
employee
may
suffer.
that's
the
language
of
that
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
so
much
modify
the
word
as
that's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
real
thrust
of
my
question
is
if
the
introductory
language
of
"reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate"
is
not
the
criterion
that
guides
the
administrator,
what
is
it?
for
work
practice
rules
or
anything
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
empirical
evidence,
is
there,
mr.
alsup?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
wrong
in
that
respect?
there's
a
sentence
that
i'm
sure
you've
read
several
times,
on
page
18a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
"the
lack
of
substantial
evidence
of
discernible
benefits
is
highlighted
when
one
considers
that
osha
is
unable
to
point
to
any
empirical
evidence
documentating
a
leukemia
risk
at
ten
parts
per
million"
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
even
though
the
standard
had
been
in
effect
since
'71.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
you
just
disagree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
at
that
time
the
bill
read
"any
impairment"
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
that
time
the
bill
read
"any
impairment
of
health"
as
opposed
to
material
impairment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree,
that
argument
doesn't
answer
this
case,
but
i
think
it
may
answer
the
concern
in
the
legislative
history
at
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
first
sentence
imposes
the
duty
on
him
to
take
--
put
on
the
toughest
feasible
standards.
but
wouldn't
he
have
the
authority
as
opposed
to
the
duty
to
take
the
toughest
feasible
standard
in
anything
he
regulates?
now,
i'm
asking
you
if
his
authority
is
any
broader,
rather
than
--
i'm
not
asking
...
