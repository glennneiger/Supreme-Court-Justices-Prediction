is
this
much
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
the
asbestos
case?

but
they
did
find
that
it
was
bad?

yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
know
i
didn't
ask
that
question,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
you
answer
the
one
i
asked?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
found
no
harm
from
benzene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
theory
is
supported
by
the
leukemia
death,
is
it
not?
in
that
people
are
exposed
to
leukemia
--
exposed
to
benzene,
died
of
leukemia
at
a
higher
proportion
than
the
normal
population
even
though
you
couldn't
say
as
a
fact
that
the
leukemia
was
brought
on
by
benzene.
