chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
industrial
union
against
the
american
petroleum
institute,
and
the
related
case.
mr.
alsup,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
one
that
takes
us
a
little
away
from
this
case.
twenty
years
ago,
approximately,
the
surgeon
general
of
the
united
states
said
that
if
spinach,
as
sold
in
the
supermarkets,
was
as
dangerous
as
cigarette
smoking,
and
the
prevalance
of
cigarette
smoke
in
the
atmosphere,
he,
the
surgeon
general,
would
take
it
off
the
market
in
24
hours.
now,
since
then,
the
department
of
hew
has
pursued
that
up
to
the
most
recently
resigned
secretary
of
hew.
it
is
pretty
well
established
that
there
are
carcinogens
which
come
into
the
atmosphere
from
cigarette
smoking,
not
only
from
the
smoker
but
from
those
exposed
to
it.
now,
would
the
secretary,
under
this
statute,
have
authority
to
ban
all
smoking
in
a
particular
work
place?
not
has
he
thought
about
it,
but
would
he
have
the
authority
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
we've
consumed
a
good
deal
of
your
time,
the
time
allotted
to
you,
we'll
extend
your
time
five
minutes
and
extend
your
time
the
same
quantity.
if
there
are
any
other
questions
if
not,
you
may
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
will
be
using
your
rebuttal
time
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
alsup.
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
understand
your
answer.
your
time
is
running
out,
perhaps
you'd
better
answer
my
brother
rehnquist's
question.
oh,
you
forgot
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
medicine
has
gone
through
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
went
through
it
with
cortisone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
can
remember
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
can
try
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
warren.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
would
be
more
convenient,
mr.
warren,
you
may
elevate
the
lectern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
remained
static
for
forty-some
years
now.
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
"discernible"
do
you
mean
quantifiable,
measurable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lettow,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
