mr.
george
h.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
i
plan
to
do
with
the
time
allocated
to
me
is
to
highlight
to
the
court
our
belief
that
section
6(b)(5)
of
the
act
is
in
fact
the
focus
and
contains
the
charters
and
indeed
the
command
to
the
secretary
of
labor
as
to
how
he
should
set
and
how
he
must
set
standards
governing
occupational
exposure
to
toxic
substances.
however,
in
order
to
frame
the
argument,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
we
bring
to
this
court
a
secretary
of
labor's
determination,
based
on
findings
of
fact,
supported
by
substantial
evidence
which
was
not
upset
by
the
fifth
circuit.
that
not
only
determined
that
exposure
to
benzene
causes
leukemia
or
cancer,
that
not
only
that
hundreds
of
workers
had
already
died
of
cancer,
and
that
indeed
30,000
or
more
workers
will
be
exposed
to
this
hazard
every
single
day
of
their
working
life
and
that,
based
on
experts
scientific
opinion
testimony,
the
determination
was
made
that
there
is
no
level,
there
is
no
level
that
can
be
considered
safe
for
employees
who
are
in
fact
exposed
to
benzene.
now,
the
secretary
of
labor
didn't
rest
on
that,
the
secretary
endeavored
to
ascertain
what
that
would
mean
in
terms
of
the
risk,
the
magnitude
of
the
risk
on
employees
in
this
work
place.
the
secretary
just
didn't
say,
"let's
forget
about
it",
the
secretary
endeavored
to
do
that
and
took
an
enormous
amount
of
testimony,
and
ended
up
concluding
that
there
simply
was
no
way
to
do
it.
there
was
no
way
to
make
an
educated
estimate
or
to
quantify
the
benefits.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
a
statutory
procedure
here.
the
guiding
light
of
6(b)(5)
says
you
do
what
will
most
adequately
protect.
but
there
is
one
constraint,
there
is
one
restraint,
this
is
not
an
absolute
statute,
you
must
do
what
is
feasible.
and
the
secretary
went
on
to
find
that
one
part
per
million
was
in
fact
feasible,
and
it's
our
understanding
that
finding
has
not
been
challenged,
was
not
upset
by
the
court
of
appeals,
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
i
know
you
were
exploring
that
with
counsel
for
the
solicitor.
the
answer
to
that,
of
course,
is
not
a
simple
one,
but
there
is
an
evidentiary
record
made.
engineering
controls,
work
practices
--
in
other
words,
a
whole
series
of
items
have
evolved
during
the
proceedings,
in
which
companies
come
in,
engineering
experts
come
in,
plant
superintendents
come
in,
and
they
say,
now,
what
can
we
do
to
eliminate?
this
is
not
a
mystical
practices.
we're
talking
here
about
gust
and
emission
from
the
source
of
a
machine
going
into
the
air.
and
testimony
comes
in,
how
can
we
eliminate
it?
and
to
what
extent
can
we
eliminate
it?
and,
for
example,
in
the
appendix,
at
page
141
in
this
case,
there's
discussion
about
the
need
to
replace
burners,
the
need
to
replace
pumps.
there
are
systems,
as
the
product
goes
through
the
plant
where
these
emissions
are
detectable,
and
where
possible,
feasible,
available
kinds
of
things
can
be
done,
and
customarily
what's
grown
up,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
a
series
of
things
that
are
done.
you
look
to
see
hood
ventilating
machinery
equipment,
you
look
at
what
kind
of
work
practices
can
be
brought
to
bear
you
look
at
a
whole
slew
of
possible
ways
to
deal
with
the
hazard,
and
that
ends
up
in
a
determination
on
the
record
by
the
secretary
as
to
what
level
can
be
achieved.
for
example,
in
many
of
these
standards,
employers
have
--
or
certain
employers
in
an
industry
have
reached
a
certain
level
and
they
bring
people
who
testify,
and
under
direct
and
cross-examination
it
is
explained
and
determined
on
what
basis
they
were
able
to
reach
that
level
and
those
kinds
of
findings
in
turn
become
the
predicate
for
the
secretary's
technological
feasibility
determination.
and
i
want
to
emphasize,
your
honor,
as
we
understand
it,
that
question
is
not
before
this
court.
industry
does
not
challenge
its
capacity,
through
engineering
controls
and
work
practices,
to
reach
the
one
ppm
level.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
i
think
we
have
to
take
a
look
back.
i
think
we
have
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
congress's
mind
when
they
passed
this
statute.
and
what
was
going
on
in
congress's
mind
was
this
parade
of
experiences
had
demonstrated
that
there
were
all
these
known
toxic
substances
cut
there,
that
indeed
with
the
new
technology
and
processes
coming
to
the
fore,
it
was
expected
that
every
twenty
seconds
another
substance,
a
potentially
toxic
substance
was
going
to
be
introduced
into
the
working
environment.
and,
as
you
know,
your
honor,
there
is
no
protesting
requirement
under
this
statute
or
any
other.
so
the
congress
of
the
united
states
knew
and
understood
this,
and
they
knew
another
thing
they
knew
that
the
state
of
the
scientific
knowledge
at
this
point
in
time
was
such
that
since
most
of
these
particular
diseases
had
what
we
refer
to
as
a
long
latency
period
--
in
other
words,
20
or
more
years
from
the
time
that
you
initially
begin
to
inhale
these
particular
substances
until
the
disease
actually
manifests
itself.
that
they
knew
that
there
was
not
going
to
be
immediate,
imminent
scientific
certainty
in
this
area.
and
in
the
face
of
that,
and
because
the
congress
decided
that
the
overriding
concern
here
had
to
be
to
maximize
the
protection
to
employee
work,
even
in
the
face
of
the
scientific
uncertainty,
they,
in
6(b)(5),
started
out,
not
only
with
the
mandates
of
the
secretary
--
and
i
want
to
discuss
that
mandate
--
but
with
the
use
of
a
very
carefully
chosen
phrase,
we
believe,
"best
available
evidence."
in
other
words,
what
this
congress
contemplated
that
the
secretary,
on
the
basis
of
a
record
submitted
before
him,
would
take
the
best
available
evidence,
everything
that
the
secretary
knew
for
sure,
and
also
having
to
deal
with
the
reality
that
things
would
not
be
known.
and,
for
example,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question,
one
of
the
things
that
was
not
known
here
was
what
would
happen
to
employees
who
were
currently
exposed
at
10
ppm.
and
i
believe
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
pet-ap
18a
was
a
correct
statement,
but
it
misses
the
mark.
it
was
correct
in
this
sense
there
is
no
direct
empirical
evidence
as
to
what
would
happen
to
people
at
10
ppm,
because
the
vast
majority
of
people
today
have
been
exposed
in
excess
of
that
number,
and
there
have
been
no
studies
that
have
demonstrated
what
would
happen
to
you.
there
was
no
direct
empirical
evidence.
worse
than
that,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
there
will
be
such
direct
empirical
evidence
for
many
years
to
come,
precisely
because
of
the
problem
with
the
latency
period.
in
1971
the
statute
was
passed,
but
for
anyone
to
make
an
intelligent
and
rational
judgment
as
to
what
the
impact
will
be,
they
have
to
take
into
consideration
we
have
a
latency
period
here
of
approximately
20
years.
so
that
any
study,
any
study
that
would
begin
to
say
there
is
no
problem
at
10
ppm
unless
there
was
a
latency
period
of
a
minimum
of
20
years,
certainly
could
not
be
a
valid
basis
for
going
ahead
and
regulating.
but
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
all
right.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
completely
the
opposite,
your
honor.
let
me
spell
that
out.
we
have
to
start
out
first
of
all
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
all
right.
now,
you've
asked
me
if
that's
part
of
the
balance
and
i'll
respond
just
as
candidly
as
i
can.
yes.
but
is
there
reason
to
think
that,
i'd
have
to
say
no.
we
have
30,000
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
that's
right,
we
don't
know.
we
do
know
this
much
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
30,000
workers
are
exposed,
we
know
that,
and
we
know
that,
notwithstanding
industry's
effort
to
identify
10
ppm
as
a
safe
level,
the
secretary,
after
carefully
reviewing
and
analyzing
all
of
those
studies,
concluded
that
those
studies
simply
do
not
stand
for
that
proposition,
and
indeed,
mr.
justice,
indeed
that
for
the
secretary
to
have
acted
on
the
basis
of
those
studies
would
have
been
a
reckless
and
irresponsible
act,
because
the
studies
didn't
stand
for
the
answer
that
industry
was
submitting
them
for.
so
what
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
and
we
think
this
is
the
posture
that
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
that
we
are
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
potentially
great
adverse
consequence,
albeit
of
unknown
dimensions.
and
i
think
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
that's
right.
i
can't
say
it
is
not
zero.
i
certainly
would
suggest
when
you
read
the
literature
and
you
see
what
has
happened
to
date,
you
would
not
want
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
if
you
don't
know,
you
use
your
best
available
evidence,
and
that's
what
the
congress
had
in
mind.
because,
if
you
don't
know
and
if
you
conclude,
in
these
circumstances,
that
you
are
not
going
to
regulate,
then,
notwithstanding
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
as
a
disclaimer,
that
this
is
not
a
statute
in
which
we
have
to
wait
for
a
body
count
we
submit
that
is
exactly
what
has
got
to
happen.
and
the
reason
why
it's
got
to
happen
here
is
the
end
product
of
what
i
was
developing
in
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
direct
empirical
evidence
at
10
does
not
exist
and
will
not
exist
for
years
to
come.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
because,
as
this
record
makes
clear,
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that.
what
i
thought
i
was
responding
to
was
your
question
as
to
whether
or
not
with
respect
to
all
toxic
substances,
is
it
impossible
to
create
a
dose-response
curve?
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
it
is
not.
indeed,
dr.
krable
of
the
national
cancer
institute,
on
the
record
in
this
case,
bemoaned
the
fact
that
he
tried,
he
tried
to
come
up
with
a
dose-response
curve
for
benzene,
and
he
points
to
that
fact,
as
i
did
with
respect
to
vinyl
chloride.
i
and
other
scientists.
and
then
he
resorted
to
the
language
of
the
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
certainly
think
under
this
statute
it
is
conceivable
that
this
will
be
something
that
will
happen
at
least
on
occasion,
but,
conversely,
--
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this
--
the
experience
under
several
of
the
other
very
serious
carcinogens
that
have
been
regulated
to
date
by
the
secretary,
there
were
in
fact
adequate
dose-response
curves
produced.
that
was
true,
for
example,
in
vinyl
chloride,
as
i
just
mentioned
and
that
was
true
to
a
major
extent
in
the
so-called
steel
industry
coke
ovens'
emission
standard,
which
is
here
in
a
companion
case
pending
before
the
court.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
good!
[laughter.]
mr.
george
h.
cohen
yes,
they
have.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
yes.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
let
me
give
you
another
point
in
that
regard.
when
the
secretary
of
labor
regulated
employee
exposure
to
asbestos,
he
did
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
serious
toxic
substance,
but
it
was
at
that
point
in
time
not
identified
as
a
carcinogen.
regrettably,
three
years
later
but
well
after
the
standard
has
been
in
place,
it's
been
identified
as
a
carcinogen.
so
the
secretary
of
labor
is
standing
there,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
these
situations
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
wish
i
could
say
i
remember
it.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
do
know
that
i
was
trying
to
articulate
to
you
a
legislative
history
of
6(b)(5)
on
you.
i
want
you
to
understand
that
6(b)(5)
just
didn't
throw
those
words
"feasible"
at
us
without
a
very
carefully
conceived
formulation.
senator
javits,
the
ranking
minority
member,
introduced
an
amendment
to
add
after
the
words
"most
adequately"
the
words
"and
feasibly".
and
when
he
did
so
he
made
it
clear
that
he
was
concerned
that
there
might
otherwise
be
interpretations
that
we
have
an
absolute
safety
and
health
standard.
they
then
reported
the
bill
out
and
a
major
debate
took
place
on
the
senate
floor,
and
that
debate
focused
on
the
question
of
feasibility.
and
senator
dominick,
who
was
the
leading
spokesman
for
the
minority
side
of
the
aisle
on
this
issue,
time
and
again
was
concerned
that
the
words
"most
adequately"
and
"feasibly"
sure
could
literally
be
read
to
mean
the
most
adequate
way
of
doing
it
is
shutting
down
the
business,
shutting
down
industry
and
banning
the
occupation.
that
was
on
the
one
side.
he
did
not
want
perfection,
he
wanted
possibilities.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
george
h.
cohen
yes,
but
i
think
we
gave
that
argument
the
shrift
that
it
is
entitled
to.
those
words,
"material"
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no,
i
think
the
"material
impairment"
language
went
directly
to
the
physical
condition
of
human
beings
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--
and
that
language,
although
the
legislative
history
is
almost
silent,
is
a
marvelous
little
statement
by
senator
saxbe
in
his
classic
fashion
saying,
"well,
with
just
the
word
'impairment',
and
we've
got
a
provision
which
says
even
if
that
individual
was
regularly
exposed
throughout
his
whole
working
life,
what
if
a
bunch
of
mosquitoes
keep
coming
back
every
month
and
biting
this
fellow,
are
we
going
to
be
in
a
position
that
some
bureaucrat
is
going
to
say
'that's
an
impairment
within
the
meaning
of
section
6(b)(5)'.
"i
believe
that
the
word
"material"
was
inserted,
although
i
don't
have
any
definitive
citation
for
you,
to
eliminate
that
kind
of
a
possibility.
not,
i
want
to
emphasize,
not
because
congress
wanted
to
inject
a
cost-benefit
analysis
concept.
this
is
a
legislative
history
that
there
was
not
one
single
mention,
not
one
reference,
with
all
the
discussion
and
all
the
focus
on
what
they
meant
by
"technological
feasibility"
or
"feasibility",
never
was
there
an
allusion
to
the
concept
of
a
cost-benefit
analysis.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
my
only
disagreement,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
would
be
your
description
of
this
is
vague.
the
focus
of
the
battle
that
senator
dominick
generated
was
the
need
to
eliminate
impossibilities.
and
he
kept
emphasizing
repeatedly,
"i
don't
want
to
create
a
utopia
which
is
impossible
of
achievement,
that
won't
accomplish
anything
i
do
want
to
accomplish
what
can
be
achieved
through
the
state
of
the
art",
at
480,
481
and
482
of
the
legislative
history
that
was
the
focus.
and
it
was
a
very
clear
focus
and
it
was
the
one
constraint,
the
one
constraint
that
the
congress
was
willing
to
put
on
what
otherwise,
we
believe,
is
a
singular
dedication
and
devotion
in
that
language
of
6(b)(5)
to
the
broadest
possible
--
the
maximum
possible
employee
protection.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
my
time
is
