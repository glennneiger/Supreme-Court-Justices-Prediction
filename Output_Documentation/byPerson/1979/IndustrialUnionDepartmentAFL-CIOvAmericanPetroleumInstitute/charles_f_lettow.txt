mr.
charles
f.
lettow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
regarding
both
the
exposure
and
the
research
evidence
grounds
that
the
fifth
circuit
had
for
its
decision
to
set
aside
the
dermal
contact
prohibition,
we
have
nothing
further,
really,
to
add
to
the
points
that
they
put
forward
in
response
to
the
action
by
osha,
except
for
one
thing.
in
its
reply
brief
in
this
court,
osha
makes
reference
to
a
1976
publication
by
the
american
conference
of
governmental
industrial
hygienists.
that's
the
group
that
set
up
the
consensus
standard
that
provides
the
10
parts
per
million
level
that's
now
in
effect.
and
it
says,
in
1976,
that
acgih
put
forward
a
skin
notation
for
benzene.
i
just
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
--
and
only
because
it's
in
the
government's
reply
brief
--
that
for
two
years
now,
'78
and
'79,
the
acgih
has
no
skin
notation
for
benzene.
it's
absent.
they
just
focus
on
the
airborne
hazard.
the
one
other
issue
of
statutory
construction
that
arises
with
respect
to
the
research
evidence
ground
is
that
what
is
best
available
evidence?
the
court
can
find
a
definition
for
best
available
evidence
fairly
easily
by
just
going
to
webster's
third
new
international
dictionary,
and
that
says
"available"
means
that
which
is
accessible
or
may
be
obtained.
and
indeed
one
of
the
examples
that
the
dictionary
uses
for
that
type
of
usage
is
"the
latest
readily
available
information".
now,
"readily
available"
is
actually
what
the
court
of
appeals
used
as
it
was
defining
that
term.
and
that
is
fairly
easily
explained
also
by
what
congress
did,
because
the
second
and
third
sentences
of
6(b)(5),
section
6(b)(5),
were
actually
taken
from
--
or
the
terms
of
them,
the
words
were
taken
from
the
research
provisions
of
the
bill
that
was
enacted.
the
research
provisions
were
there
first.
and
the
research
provisions
in
section
20(a),
especially
20(a)
(3),
make
a
reference
to
research,
demonstrations,
and
experiments.
that's
where
that
language
comes
from.
so
they
knew
what
they
were
talking
about.
they
knew
that
osha
had
to
do
some
research
in
order
to
be
able
to
come
up
with
standards
under
some
instances.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
your
honor,
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes,
i
did.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
the
issue
of
feasibility
is
one
that
we
have
argued
strongly
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
because
they
didn't
decide
it,
they
said
that
was
the
issue
that
was
most
affected
by
the
amendment
to
the
standard
that
came
at
the
eve
of
oral
argument,
literally
on
the
eve,
the
afternoon
before.
we
argued
that
issue
in
supplemental
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals.
but
because
it
didn't
decide
it,
it
hasn't
been
briefed
here.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
it
is
open
and
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that's
right.
but
you
can
understand
why
we
didn't
brief
it
here,
because
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
it.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes,
sir,
it
is
still
open.
and
it
is
referred
to
in
the
osha
reply
brief,
and
of
course
we
disagree
with
them,
and
if
you're
interested
in
that
subject
we
would
suggest
going
back
to
the
briefs
on
the
merits
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
secretary,
that
is
osha,
does
make
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
in
the
tire
industry
you
need
skin
contact,
you
need
dermal
contact
with
solvents.
they
have
put
forward,
and
the
basis
for
the
feasibility
claim
is
now
based
on
the
percentage
exclusion
to
the
standard,
whether
or
not
that's
sufficient
in
terms
of
these
solvents.
that
is
what
is
actually
briefed.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
your
honor,
i
honestly
don't
think
that
it
ever
left
the
fifth
circuit.
when
you
granted
certiorari
you
didn't
get
to
that
issue,
and
i
guess
the
question
you
would
have
in
your
action
in
this
court
is
whether
or
not
you
would
agree
with
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
two
grounds
they
adopted,
if
you
did
or
did
not
it
would
go
back
to
the
fifth
circuit.
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
--
well,
the
fifth
circuit
would
decide
the
feasibility
question
and
then
it
would
or
would
not
go
back
to
osha.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
thank
you.
