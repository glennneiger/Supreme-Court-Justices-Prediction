justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
that
--
do
you
mean
to
argue
that
if
the
--
if
the
indian
purchasers
had
left
the
reservation
and
gone
into
the
city
or
gone
into
a
town
or
some
neighborhood
--
neighboring
community
and
negotiated
the
purchase
of
a
tractor,
paid
for
it
there
and
took
--
and
delivery
taken
there
that
--
that
the
seller
would
have
had
to
qualify
as
an
indian
trader?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
and
whoever
--
and
the
seller
wouldn't
have
to
--
wouldn't
have
to
be
recognized
as
an
indian
trader.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you
--
what
if
he
went
off
to
the
reservation
and
took
--
and
bought
--
bought
and
paid
for
the
tractor
in
the
adjoining
community
and
asked
that
it
be
delivered
on
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
isn't
your
case,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
shouldn't
--
should
--
should
central
had
a
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
that
the
trading
statute
did
apply,
the
only
--
except
for
the
licensing
provision,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
extent
of
the
economic
burden
any
factor
in
your
argument
or
is
it
just
a
straight
preemption
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
nothing
an
approach
from
the
outside
if
a
farm
machinery
dealer
simply
advertises
on
local
television?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
on
local
radio
and
advertises
john
deere
tractors
at
a
very
low
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
off
the
--
off
--
off
the
indian
goes
to
buy
a
tractor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
perhaps.
how
about
--
is
it
perhaps
so
and
perhaps
not
or
--
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
flyer
in
the
mail
to
all
residents
of
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
the
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
the
indian
then
leaves
the
reservation,
signs
the
contract,
takes
delivery
off
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
clear
about
this
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
sovereign,
an
indian
sovereign,
it's
got
some
relationship
to
indian's
tribal
sovereignty,
i
take
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
--
suppose
we
agreed
with
you
in
this
case
and
then
central
decided
that
“well,
we
--
we've
read
that
opinion
and
we've
--
so,
we're
going
to
open
a
branch
on
the
reservation.”
they
had
an
office
on
the
reservation.
they
either
were
licensed
or
they
weren't
but,
i
gather,
you
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
could
you
collect
from
them
then
if
they'd
--
if
they'd
made
exactly
the
same
kind
of
sale,
the
only
thing
is
they
had
an
office
on
the
reservation
and
made
the
sale
over
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
--
it
may
but,
i
take
it
on
your
rationale,
i
would
take
you
would
want
to
cut
into
warren
trading
post.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
yes.
so,
i
would
think
you
would
say
that
under
your
current
rationale,
you
should
--
you
would
be
able
to
collect
even
if
they
moved
into
an
office
on
the
reservation
and
made
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
sale
over
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
it
say
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
a
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
--
no,
i'm
not
--
you
went
there.[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
macpherson,
was
warren
trading
post
before
we
started
transcribing
oral
arguments?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
did
you
listen
to
the
tape?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
you
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
you
--
where
did
you
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
--
they
--
you
can
get
a
copy
from
them
anytime
just
by
asking?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
thanks
very
much.
