we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
central
machinery
company
against
arizona
state
tax
commission.
mr.
lewis,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
suggesting
that
the
licensing
would
be
a
--
is
merely
a
matter
of
form
of
formality?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then,
are
you
saying
that
it's
the
status
of
the
indian
tribe
that
is
the
dispositive
factor
and
that
all
these
other
factors
are
unimportant
and
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
i
think
you
have
yielded
part
of
your
time
to
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
not
or
do
you
--
i'll
put
it
this
way,
do
you
agree
with
judge
o'connor's
statement
in
her
opinion
that
it
is
the
existence,
the
existence
of
the
federal
laws
accompanying
regulations
and
not
their
enforcement
which
preempts
the
state's
ability
to
tax
the
transaction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
boundaries
were
fixed
up
by
the
indians
put
by
treaties
and
by
acts
of
congress,
as
justice
stewart
suggested.
before
that,
the
indians
merely
claimed
sovereignty
over
rather
indefinite
and
vaguely
defined
lands.
wasn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
macpherson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
there
be
tax
exemption
if
it
was
a
cod
transaction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
it
delivered
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
on
the
reservation
on
a
cash-on-delivery
at
that
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
--
what
if
the
tribe
had
contracted
for
these
tractors
in
oklahoma
and
delivered
them
themselves
on
over-the-road
trucks
to
their
reservation,
can
arizona
tax
something?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
indians
go
over
to
oklahoma
or
any
other
nearby
states
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
say,
“we
want
to
buy
these
tractors.
deliver
them
any
way
you
want,
railroads
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
railroad
trucks
or
whatever.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
--
because
an
indian
tribe
might
be
subject
to
some
indirect
taxes
doesn't
mean
that
they're
automatically
subject
to
all
other
more
visible
taxes,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can't
anymore
because
our
tapes
are
not
delivered
to
them
any
longer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
