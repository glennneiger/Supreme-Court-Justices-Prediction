mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
begin
by
saying
that
we
wholly
endorse
and
have
in
our
brief,
primarily
relied
on
the
statutory
preemption
argument.
and
with
respect
to
that,
in
answer
to
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench,
i
would
put
the
matter
this
way.
the
purpose
of
the
indian
trader
statutes
was
to
protect
indian
tribes
against
the
abuses
of
those
who
came
on
to
that
indian
territory,
who
came
within
indian
country
and
tried
to
sell
them
goods
or
services.
it,
therefore,
does
matter
whether
it's
the
tribe
that
goes
outside
to
purchase
equipment
or
whether
it's
the
dealer
who
comes
onto
the
reservation
to
sell
to
the
tribe.
whether
some
part
of
the
negotiation
is
subsequently
conducted
on
or
off
the
reservation
may
be
less
critical
than
whether
the
approach
comes
from
the
outside
or
whether,
rather,
it's
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
indian
tribe
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
perhaps
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
perhaps
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
perhaps
not.
perhaps
that's
not
an
intrusion
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
have
thought
not.
i
would
have
thought
that
when
the
dealer
either
by
mail,
by
telephone
or
by
personal
entry
onto
the
reservation,
approaches
the
tribe
with
the
view
to
selling
machinery
or
any
other
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
goods
or
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that,
i
think,
would
be
an
invitation
from
outside
and
that
would
and
should
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
subject
to
federal
supervision.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
white,
of
course,
there
are
gradations
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
clear
as
to
each
of
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
one,
because
we've
got
an
approach
from
the
outside,
we've
got
the
transaction
conducted
wholly
within
the
reservation,
we've
got
the
contract
signed
there,
and
we've
got
delivery
effected
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
insofar
as
we
rely
on
statutory
preemption.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
primarily
rely
but
we
have,
as
your
honor
may
know
from
our
brief,
also
suggested
that
there
is
a
constitutional
dimension
to
the
case.
appreciate
that
that
matter
was
not
urged
below.
we
felt
it,
at
the
court's
invitation
as
amicus
curiae,
our
duty
to
put
forward
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
what
we
think
is
a
constitutional
preemption
argument
which
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
an
indian
commerce
clause
argument.
we
--
as
to
that,
we
begin
with
the
proposition
which
has
been
endorsed
by
this
court
starting
in
the
worcester
case
and
most
recently
reaffirmed
in
bryan
versus
itasca
county
that
the
power
to
deal
with
indian
tribes
is
exclusively
a
federal
power.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
we
endorse
that
statement
entirely.
it
seems
to
us
irrelevant
if,
and
we
don't
suggest
that
it
is
the
case,
but
if
it
were
the
case,
that
the
department
of
the
interior
had
defaulted
by
failing
to
apply
the
indian
trader
statutes
here
to
this
transaction,
that
ought
not
give
leave
to
the
state
of
arizona
to
impose
its
tax.
preemption
in
this
area,
an
area
committed
by
the
constitution
exclusively
to
the
federal
government,
is
one
in
which
the
doctrine
of
preemption
depends
on
existence
rather
than
the
exercise
of
federal
statutory
power.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
take
that
statement
to
address
the
broad
proposition
they
put
forward
that
the
relation
with
indians
and
with
indian
tribes,
even
off
reservation,
was
exclusively
a
matter
of
federal
concern.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
assume,
and
i
think
with
some
justification
in
history,
that
the
indian
commerce
clause
was
written
against
the
background
of
two
kinds
of
indians
for
the
most
part
then,
on
their
own
territory
within
indian
country.
that
was
the
indian
commerce
spoken
of.
when
indians
had
assimilated,
had
joined
the
general
population,
were
no
longer
on
their
reservation,
that
was
not
indian
commerce.
the
indians
had
lost
their
character
as
a
tribe,
and
we're
talking
about
the
tribal
commerce,
not
an
individual
indian
who
goes
off
to
buy
a
car
or
any
other
product.
we're
talking
about,
as
the
constitution
does,
commerce
with
the
indian
tribes
within
their
territory,
as
now
defined
by
reservations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
they
were
more
independent
then
than
now,
but
the
cherokees
in
the
worcester
case
were
on
their
reserved
lands,
those
which
they
had
not
seated
and
the
reservations
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
how
--
in
some
cases,
of
course,
they're
simply
federal
lands
set
aside
for
indians.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
they're
all,
and
most
reservations
today
are
simply
the
residual
of
aboriginal
indian
lands
which
are
now
more
restricted
in
area
and
more
subject
to
both
federal
and
to
some
degree,
state
regulation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
to
some
degree,
mr.
chief
justice.
but,
of
course,
there
were
a
number
of
treaties
long
before
the
decision
in
worcester
which
had
defined
the
area
which
could
remain,
which
was
not
seated
and
which
was
recognized
as
that
pertaining
to
the
indian
tribes.
and
indeed,
the
worcester
case
involved
the
cherokee
area
which
had
been
defined,
at
least
twice
by
treaty
by
then
and
was
very
much
less
than
the
aboriginal
area
roamed
by
the
cherokee
tribes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
not
quite
true,
mr.
justice
stevens.
there'd
been
a
number
of
treaties
before
the
constitution
which
had
a
fixed
boundaries
between
the
white-man's
land
and
the
indian
land.
now,
the
--
the
--
it's
true
that
--
and
of
course,
they
were
indians
within
the
states
even
then
with
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
were
--
the
united
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
states
before
the
constitution
and
continental
congress.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
period
between
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
constitution
and
the
period
of
the
continental
congress
was
a
period
of
the
united
states,
although
not
governed
by
the
confederation
rather
than
the
constitution.
and
those
states,
the
state
of
new
york,
the
state
of
massachusetts,
had
indian
enclaves
within
them.
witness
article
i
of
the
constitution
which
excludes
the
indians
within
states
from
being
counted
in
the
enumeration
of
representatives.
those
are
only
the
indians
within
the
states
that
are
spoken
of.
the
question
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us,
is
whether
the
exclusive
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
deal
with
indian
tribes
includes,
as
the
constitutional
language
itself
suggests,
commercial
relations
between
the
white
world
and
the
indian
world.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
was
a
matter
that
was
confined
by
the
constitution
to
the
congress
duly
exercised
in
the
non-intercourse
acts
but
not
entirely
dependent
on
that
exercise.
just
as
a
state
cannot
authorize
the
session
of
indian
land
today
regardless
of
the
intercourse
acts,
so
today,
the
states
cannot
tax
or
regulate
commerce
in
chattels
between
the
indian
tribes
and
the
white
world.
