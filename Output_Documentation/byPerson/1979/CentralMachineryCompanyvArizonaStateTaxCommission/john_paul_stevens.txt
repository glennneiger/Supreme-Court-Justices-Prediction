justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lewis,
could
i
ask
you
a
question.
was
this
transaction
approved
by
the
federal
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
when
--
when
it
was
approved,
did
the
person
who
granted
the
approval
know
the
terms
of
the
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
it
be
inferred
that
the
approval
carried
with
it
approval
of
the
transaction
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
--
was
there
any
objection
made
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government
to
the
payment
of
the
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lewis,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understood
you
correctly.
did
you
respond
to
mr.
justice
white
by
saying
that
if
the
contract
had
been
signed
off
the
reservation
that
then
the
tax
could
be
imposed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
cannot
be
applied
if
they
go
off
the
reservation,
negotiate
the
whole
transaction
and
go
back
on
the
reservation
and
sign
the
papers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
always
going
to
be
made
on
the
--
the
delivery
was
made
on
the
reservation
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
here
and
in
--
i
think,
in
mr.
justice
white's
example
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
key
is
where
they
sign
the
contract.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
one
case,
he
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
signs
it
in
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
if
the
only
difference
is
where
you
sign
the
contract,
is
that
the
difference
between
taxation
and
no
taxation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
it
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
is
it
delivery
any
time
merchandise
is
delivered
on
the
reservation?
you
--
i
think
you've
changed
your
position
now.
you
said
even
if
it
was
signed
off
the
reservation,
it
would
be
preemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
what
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
is
--
what
is
your
view
of
the
line
between
the
taxable
transaction
and
a
non-taxable
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
none
of
those
reservations
had
been
created
when
the
constitutional
language
was
drafted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
different
tax
imposed
on
that
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
on
the
vendee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
that
case,
would
you
say
you
could
or
could
not
collect
the
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
not?
why
do
you
concede
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
apart
from
our
court's
decision,
just
to
get
the
theoretical
basis
for
it,
what
is
the
reason
that
there
cannot
be
a
tax
in
that,
other
than
that
the
court
has
said
so?
is
there
a
legal
reason
for
those
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
what
--
what
is
--
what
is
the
underlying
rationale
of
the
court's
decisions
as
you
understand
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
asking
you,
why
cannot
that
be
done?
is
it
a
constitutional
reason
or
a
statutory
reason
or
just
some
general
reason
of
judicial
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
that
rationale
apply
here?
what
--
i'm
trying
to
identify
the
rationale,
then
my
next
question
would
be
why
does
not
that
rationale
apply
here?
that's
--
that's
pretty
obvious.
that's
why
i'm
asking
these
questions,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
makes
any
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it's
a
tribe
or
--
or
individual
indians
that's
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
find
this
a
very
confusing
area
and
i'm
asking
questions
because
i'm
trying
to
understand
it.
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
satisfactory
answer
or
not.
