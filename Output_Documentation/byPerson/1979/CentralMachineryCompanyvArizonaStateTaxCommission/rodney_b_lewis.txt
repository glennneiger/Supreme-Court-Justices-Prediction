mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
it
involves
a
question
of
whether
the
state
of
arizona
can
impose
a
transaction
privilege
tax
on
the
sale
of
11
tractors
to
the
gila
river
indian
community.
in
1973,
representatives
of
central
machinery
went
upon
the
gila
river
indian
reservation
for
the
purpose
of
selling
farm
machinery
to
gila
river
farms.
gila
river
farms
is
a
subsidiary
and
business
enterprise
of
the
gila
river
indian
community,
a
recognized
indian
tribe,
organized
pursuant
to
section
16
of
the
indian
reorganization
act.
after
negotiations
which
occurred
on
the
reservation,
gila
river
farms
agreed
to
purchase
11
john
deere
tractors.
subsequently,
delivery
and
payment
for
the
tractors
was
made
on
the
reservation.
central
machinery
added
to
the
purchase
price
the
amount
of
$2916.62
which
was
paid
by
gila
river
farms
to
central
machinery.
central
machinery
remitted
these
funds
to
the
state
of
arizona
as
payment
for
the
transaction
privilege
tax.
central
machinery
paid
this
tax
under
protest.
the
sale
was
approved
by
the
superintendent
of
pima
agency,
the
secretary's
representative
on
the
gila
river
indian
reservation.
the
pima
agency
superintendent
allowed
central
machinery
to
come
onto
the
reservation
and
transact
this
business
without
securing
a
trader's
license.
the
superintendent,
prior
to
the
sale,
had
also
approved
the
farms'
budget
which
had
set
aside
moneys
for
the
purchase
of
the
tractors.
administrative
appeals
and
court
action
in
the
arizona
courts
followed,
culminating
in
this
appeal
before
this
court.
the
trader
statute,
u.s.c.
261-264,
and
federal
regulations
preempt
arizona's
jurisdiction
to
levy
this
tax
on
this
sale.
it
is
our
position
that
warren
trading
post
governs
this
case,
thereby,
preventing
application
or
imposition
of
the
transaction
privilege
tax,
a
tax
which
is
measured
by
sales
to
this
sales
transaction.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
i
am
not
sure
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
sufficient
connection
to
the
state
of
arizona,
allowing
arizona
to
impose
that
tax.
and
of
course,
it's
not
the
situation
here
before
us.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
i
don't
think
the
licensing
by
the
interior
is
dispositive
in
this
case
nor
do
i
think
it
would
be
handled
the
same
way
regarding
a
transaction
in
new
mexico.
we're
--
our
position
is
that
warren
trading
post,
which
held
that
federal
statutes
and
accompanying
regulations
preempted
the
field,
did
not
allow
the
--
did
not
allow
the
imposition
of
this
tax
to
this
transaction.
warren
trading
post
held
that
--
that
congress
has
undertaken
to
regulate
reservation
trading
in
such
a
comprehensive
way
that
there's
no
room
for
the
states
to
legislate
the
subject.
any
assessment
and
collection
of
a
tax
involved
here
was
held
in
warren
to
frustrate
the
evident
congressional
purpose
of
ensuring
that
no
burden
be
imposed
upon
indian
traders,
trading
with
indians
or
reservations,
except
as
authorized
by
acts
of
congress
or
by
valid
regulations
promulgated
under
those
acts.
congress
enacted
the
trader
statute
to
deter
fraud
and
prevent
exploitation
of
indians
engaged
in
commercial
transaction
with
an
indian
country.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
the
transaction
was
approved
by
the
federal
government.
it's
approved
by
the
secretary's
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
--
representatives
and
the
superintendent.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
he
knew
the
terms
of
the
transaction.
he
had
approved
the
moneys
which
had
--
which
had
been
set
aside
by
gila
river
farms,
specifically
for
the
purchase
of
the
tractors.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
no,
it
cannot.
first
of
all,
i
--
i
think
our
position
is
that
the
agency
superintendent
simply
recognized
that
there
was
a
--
a
problem
involved
here.
he
only
approved
the
transaction
realizing
that
gila
river
farms
and
central
machinery
had
paid
this
tax
under
protest.
second
of
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
there
is
no
objection,
at
that
time,
made
under
--
made
by
the
federal
government
to
the
imposition
of
the
tax.
he
was
aware,
of
course,
that
the
tax
had
been
paid
under
protest.
the
power
of
congress
to
legislate
in
this
area
stems
from
the
indian
commerce
clause,
article
iii,
section
8,
clause
3
of
the
united
states
constitution.
on
their
face,
these
statutes
indicate
that
exclusive
power
to
regulate
trading
rest
with
the
federal
government.
for
instance,
25
u.s.c.
261
says
that
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
has
sole
power
and
authority
to
appoint
indian
traders.
25
u.s.c.
262
specifies
that
any
person
must
first
satisfy
the
commissioner
that
he
is
a
proper
person
to
deal
with
--
to
trade
with
indians.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
if
we
went
off
the
reservation
to
buy
these
tractors,
we
would
be
subject
to
the
arizona
transaction
privilege
tax.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
the
seller
would
not
have
to
be
recognized
as
an
indian
trader.
when
he
comes
onto
the
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
that's
--
that
would
not
be
our
case.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
that
--
that's
a
different
situation.
it's
a
little
difficult
to
answer
that
but
it's
--
in
that
case,
i
think
that
--
that
the
transaction
could
be
taxed.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
the
federal
government
has
traditionally
and
historically
regulated
trading
involving
indians.
beginning
in
1790,
it
enacted
the
trader
statutes,
and
throughout
the
19th
century,
the
trader
statutes
were
amended
from
time
to
time.
because
of
this
predominant
federal
interest,
state
regulation
has
often
been
precluded.
the
sale
by
central
machinery
to
gila
river
farms
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
trader
statute
and
the
holding
of
warren
trading
post,
25
u.s.c.
for
instance,
264
penalizes
any
person
conducting
unauthorized
trading
with
indians
or
indian
tribes
and
the
commissioner
has
issued
comprehensive
regulations
to
carry
out
the
objectives
of
the
statute.
the
attempt
to
attack
this
--
the
sale
of
these
tractors
to
gila
river
farms
which
occurred
on
the
reservation
must
follow
since
the
trader
statutes
preempt
arizona's
jurisdiction
to
enact
this
tax
and
because
of
the
holding
--
the
interpretation
of
the
trader
statutes
by
warren
trading
post.
our
second
argument
deals
with
the
fact
that
the
tax
interferes
with
the
federal
purposes
of
the
gila
river
indian
reservation.
the
reservation
was
established
in
1859
to
provide
pimas
and
maricopas
a
sound
economic
base.
gila
river
farms
is
pursuing
this
objective.
pimas
and
maricopas
have
farmed
along
the
gila
river
for
hundreds
and
even
thousands
of
years,
certainly
before
the
establishment
of
the
american
republic.
imposition
of
the
arizona
transaction
privilege
--
privilege
tax
burdens
the
economic
purpose
of
the
reservation.
second
of
all,
the
tax
interferes
with
tribal
self-government.
warren
invalidated
the
same
tax
in
1965,
this
tax
which
--
which
is
measured
by
sales,
because
it
--
in
part
because
it
interfered
with
tribal
self-government.
and
mcclanahan
invalidate
arizona's
income
tax
because
of
its
interference
with
tribal
self-government.
the
gila
river
indian
--
indian
community's
ability
to
govern
itself
will
likewise
be
interfered
with.
i
would
like
to
now
address
two
arguments
raised
by
the
state
of
arizona.
first
--
and
--
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
thought
it
important
that
because
of
the
lack
of
trader's
license,
this
transaction
did
not
come
within
the
trader
statutes
or
the
holding
in
warren.
first
of
all,
there
is
not
a
statutory
requirement
that
central
machinery
have
a
trader's
license
to
engage
in
trading
on
a
reservation.
the
purpose
of
these
statutes,
as
i
mentioned
before,
is
to
supervise
trading
with
indians
and
indian
tribes
to
prevent
unfair
prices
and
practices.
issuance
of
a
trader's
license
is
not
the
exclusive
way
in
which
or
method
in
which
the
federal
government
uses
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
the
statutes.
for
instance,
the
code
of
federal
regulations
allows
peddlers
to
go
onto
the
reservations
to
trade
for
limited
purposes.
therefore,
they
need
correspondingly
less
supervision.
here,
there
was
extensive
supervision
which
met
the
objectives
of
the
statutes,
that
is,
to
deter
fraud
and
prevent
exploitation
of
indians.
there
is
a
specific
approval
of
the
sale.
there
was
approval
of
the
tribe
--
of
the
farms'
budget
which
included
money
set
aside
for
the
tractors,
and
there
was
approval
of
the
tribal
budget,
the
parent
of
the
tribal
--
of
the
gila
river
indian
community,
the
parent
organization
of
gila
river
farms,
as
is
required
by
article
15
of
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
gila
river
indian
community
which
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
a
determination
was
made
by
the
agency
superintendent
in
this
single
transaction
that
a
license
not
be
issued
because
there
had
been
--
probably,
because
there
had
been
adequate
supervision
of
this
transaction,
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute
had
been
met
and
accomplished.
a
second
argument
raised
by
--
by
the
state
of
arizona,
and
which
was
discussed
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion
in
arizona,
was
that
it
did
not
come
in
within
the
trader
statutes,
this
transaction
did
not
come
within
the
trader
statutes
or
warren
trading
post
because
it
lacked
a
permanent
place
of
business
on
the
reservation.
again,
the
trader
statutes
don't
require
that
persons
engaged
in
the
commercial
transactions
with
indians
within
indian
country
have
a
--
have
a
permanent
place
of
business
on
that
reservation.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
central
did
not
need
a
license
in
this
case.
the
purposes
of
the
statute
had
been
met.
there
was
direct
supervision
of
the
entire
transaction
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
representative.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
the
trader
statutes
apply.
the
licensing
is
not
required
by
the
statute.
the
force
of
the
federal
government
in
--
in
supervising
the
sale
was,
in
effect,
the
full
force.
the
sale
was
comprehensively
regulated
by
the
agency
superintendent.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
in
this
case,
it
was
a
mere
formality.
the
--
the
actual
supervision
had
taken
place.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
well,
that's
basically
our
argument.
but,
certainly,
the
economic
burden
of
the
tribe
on
a
group
of
indians
with
limited
resources
certainly
is
a
--
has
a
strong
effect.
this
$2916
adds
up
when
you
count
the
tremendous
amount
of
similar
transactions
which
occur.
these
are
funds
which
ordinarily
would
go
to
the
support
of
the
tribal
government
which
is
--
which
has
as
its
purpose
to
maintain
government
on
the
reservation
and
to
attempt
to
establish
a
sound
economic
base
for
pimas
and
maricopas
who
have
lived
there
since
time
immemorial.
in
summary,
the
trader
statutes
preempt
arizona's
authority
to
tax
a
sale.
warren
trading
post,
interpreting
the
--
the
trader
statutes
governs
and
controls
this
case,
preventing
imposition
of
this
transaction
privilege
tax
which
is
measured
by
sales.
imposition
of
the
tax
will
interfere
with
the
federal
purposes
of
the
reservation
to
provide
a
sound
economic
base
for
pima
and
maricopa
indians
and
interferes
with
the
right
of
the
gila
river
indian
community,
a
tribe,
to
govern
itself.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
no.
i
think
the
--
the
question
was
if
we
at
the
--
if
the
farms
had
gone
off
the
reservation,
bought
the
tractors,
then
that
would
be
a
different
situation,
probably
the
arizona's
tax
would
apply
in
that
situation.
but
in
this
case
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
well,
i
think
if
delivery
was
made
on
the
reservation
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
yes,
it
was.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
i
think
it's
the
mere
fact
that
some
negotiations
took
place
off
the
reservation,
i
still
think,
would
prevent
imposition
of
this
tax,
but
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
no.
the
key
is
that
you
have
a
--
a
trader
dealing
with
indian
tribes
and
--
and
the
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
--
statutes
regulate
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
--
this
trade.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
no,
that's
not
the
difference
between
taxation
and
--
and
no
taxation.
when
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
well,
the
taxable
event
in
this
case
was
the
--
this
--
the
transaction
or
the
sale
of
the
--
the
sale
of
the
tractors
to
the
gila
river
indian
community.
some
of
the
--
that
was
a
taxable
event.
the
elements
of
the
sale
involved
negotiation,
signing
a
contract,
making
payment
and
delivery.
these
took
place,
in
this
case,
on
the
reservation.
now,
if
in
a
situation,
negotiations
took
place
off
the
reservation,
that
would
not
make
any
difference.
the
trader
statutes
still
govern
that
transaction.
if
the
contract
was
signed
off
the
reservation,
i
still
don't
think
that
the
--
i
still
think
the
trader
statutes
would
govern
--
govern
the
situation
and
preempt
the
state's
authority
to
levy
the
tax.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
the
--
in
this
case,
these
events
--
these
events
took
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
the
--
the
line
--
the
line
is
--
is
drawn
when
you're
dealing
with
an
indian
tribe
with
an
indian
country.
that's
one
line.
dealing
with
a
--
a
business,
an
important
part,
important
function
of
the
tribal
government,
that's
a
second
major
--
major
fact.
and
the
--
finally,
you're
talking
about
--
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
a
series
of
events
which
constitute
the
sale
which
also
took
place
in
the
reservation.
when
you're
dealing
with
an
indian
tribe
within
an
--
with
an
indian
country
for
the
sale,
that
--
this
comes
within
the
trader
statutes.
it
comes
within
the
meaning
of
warren.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
well,
the
--
the
status
of
the
indian
tribe,
the
fact
that
it
occurred
within
indian
country,
it
was
a
commercial
transaction,
yes,
those
are
the
factors
which
preempt
the
arizona
state
sales
tax.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
did
it
not?
it
did.
the
--
the
ski
lodge
in
issue
there
was
off
the
reservation.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
under
mescalero,
that,
of
course,
involved
a
different
situation.
it
involved
indian
property
located
off
the
reservation.
that's
not
the
situation
here.
that's
the
fact
that
it's
an
indian
tribe
is
--
is
not
dispositive
of
--
of
the
situation.
it's
a
fact
that
there
was
business,
occurred
or
performed
with
an
indian
country,
the
fact
that
it
was
an
indian
tribe,
the
fact
in
this
case
that
the
events
of
the
sale
took
place
on
the
reservation.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
by
the
submission
today,
it
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
we
would
not
be
making
the
claim.
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
i
think
simple
delivery
of
that
--
of
the
truck
on
the
reservation
probably
would
not
bring
this
--
this
--
mr.
rodney
b.
lewis
would
not
be
quite
enough.
