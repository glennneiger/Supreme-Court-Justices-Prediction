mr.
lewis,
would
you
agree
that
if,
instead
of
the
transaction
taking
place
on
the
gila
river
reservation,
it
had
taken
place
in
new
mexico
and
arizona
had
sought
to
levy
its
privilege
tax,
it
would
be
taxable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
there
had
been
a
--
do
you
--
do
you
think
the
same
standard
would
govern
or
do
you
think
that
it's
the
licensing
by
the
secretary
of
interior
and
the
other
peculiarly
indian
aspects
of
this
case
that
govern?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly,
mescalero,
the
decision
in
our
court
in
--
several
years
ago,
rejected
the
idea
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
--
it
was
an
indian
tribe
automatically
meant
federal
preemption,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
i
mean,
so
far
as
the
--
but
if
the
status
of
the
indian
tribe
wasn't
endowed
so
the
status,
by
itself,
wouldn't
be
given
exemption
here,
would
it,
under
--
under
mescalero.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
on
the
statement
in
mescalero,
on
page
147
of
the
u.s.
reports,
“at
the
outset,
we
reject
as
to
the
state
court
the
broad
assertion
that
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
tribe
for
all
purposes
and
that
the
state
is
therefore
prohibited
from
enforcing
its
revenue
--
revenue
laws
against
any
tribal
enterprises”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it's
indian
commerce,
certainly,
indian
commerce
can
take
place
off
reservation
as
well
as
on
reservation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
--
were
there
states
before
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
proclamation
line
of
lord
jeffery
amherst
and
king
george
iii
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
no
superintendent
of
the
gila
river
indian
tribe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
macpherson,
isn't
there
a
body
of
law
to
the
effect
that
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
government
cannot
estop
it,
that
is,
that
just
because
a
representative
of
the
--
of
the
government
makes
a
statement
or
a
decision
that
a
federal
statute
is
to
be
applied
in
a
perfect
way
--
particular
way
some
time
ago
does
not
necessarily
conclude
the
government
on
that
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
arizona
doesn't
prevent
the
vendor
from
passing
along
a
tax
to
the
vendee,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
contention,
as
you
understand
it,
mr.
macpherson,
made
by
the
government
or
by
the
tribe
that
the
central
machinery
company
was
in
violation
of
federal
law
or
regulations
because
it
had
not
obtained
a
license
and
nonetheless,
done
business
with
the
indians?
