mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
ian
macpherson
and
i
represent
the
appellees
in
this
case.
i
think,
at
the
outset,
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
point
out
a
couple
of
facts
that
were
raised
in
the
opening
remarks
by
both
counsel
for
the
taxpayer
and
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
lewis,
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer,
has
stated
in
--
in
his
opening
remarks
that
there
was
an
extensive
regulation
and
supervision
of
the
purchase
of
these
tractors.
a
further
examination
of
the
facts
will
reveal,
and
the
record
supports
this,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
stipulated
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
upon
which
the
matter
was
submitted
to
the
superior
court
on
cross-motion
for
summary
judgment,
that,
in
addition
to
the
visible
economic
burden
of
the
arizona
transaction
privilege
tax,
central
machinery
company
included
as
well,
as
an
undifferentiated
cost
component
the
economic
burdens
of
many
of
its
other
state
taxes,
that
is,
central
machinery
company,
it
being
a
non-indian
arizona
corporation
engaged
in
business
within
the
state
of
arizona
at
casa
grande,
arizona,
which
this
court
may
take
note
of
and
it's
stipulated
in
the
facts,
is
not
located
within
any
reservation
whatsoever,
is
subject
itself
to
a
number
of
other
state
taxes,
state
income
taxes,
state
property
taxes,
so
on
and
so
forth.
the
economic
burdens
of
those
taxes,
to
be
distinguished
of
course
from
the
legal
incidence
of
the
taxes,
were
blended
in
to
the
purchase
price
of
all
of
the
tractors.
those
undifferentiated
cost
burdens
were
approved
in
the
purchase
order.
and
i
think
at
this
point,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
purchase
order
itself
was
approved
on
february
22nd
of
1974.
the
purchase
order
listed
not
only
the
individual
tractors
with
an
individual
price
for
each
tractor,
but
also
a
grand
total
for
the
total
of
the
11
tractors,
some
$97,000
plus
the
visible
economic
burden
of
some
$2900
for
the
arizona
transaction
privilege
tax.
that
purchase
order
was
submitted
to
the
superintendent
of
the
pima
agency,
that
agent
who
has
authority
over
this
particular
reservation.
if
the
argument
be
made
that
there
was
an
--
an
extensive
supervision
of
the
purchase,
the
fact
is,
the
record
is
barren
of
any
indication
other
than
that,
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
or
his
delegate,
the
superintendent
of
the
pima
agency
approved
it,
simply
rubberstamped
the
purchase
order
that
was
put
in
front
of
him.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
--
that
--
that's
my
understanding.
the
gila
river
--
gila
river
indian
reservation
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
pima
agent,
i
believe,
out
of
tucson.
in
any
event,
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
25
u.s.c.
81
governs
the
result
in
this
case,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
central
machinery
had
neither
an
indian
trader's
license
nor
an
itinerant
peddler's
permit,
that
section
81
applies,
that
is
the
general
power
to
approve
contracts.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
pima
agent
did
not
reject
that
cost
that
was
included
with
the
purchase
order.
he
specifically
approved
it.
now,
with
respect
to
the
warren
trading
post
case,
that
fact
situation
fits
precisely
into
the
opinion
rendered
by
assistant
solicitor
harper
in
58
i.d.
562,
upon
which
this
court
relied
and
cited
with
approval
in
the
warren
trading
post
case.
in
that
particular
interior
department
opinion,
it
was
specifically
provided
that,
where
a
purchase
order
is
issued
to
a
merchant
doing
business
off
the
reservation,
they
are
subject
to
state
taxes
including,
if
the
court
please,
those
purchases
which
relate
to
items,
goods,
whatever
for
a
specific
program
of
indian
development.
in
doing
so,
assistant
solicitor
harper
overruled
a
prior
provision
in
57
i.d.
124.
previously,
the
opinion
of
the
interior
department
had
been
that
these
purchases,
being
for
indian
development
and
in
view
of
the
“confused
state
of
the
law
at
the
time”,
were
felt
at
that
time
not
by
solicitor
harper
but,
rather,
mr.
corgis,
assistant
solicitor
corgis,
to
be
except
from
state
taxation.
in
58
i.d.
562,
on
the
other
hand,
solicitor
harper
specifically
points
out
that,
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
cases,
among
others,
james
v.
dravo,
the
penn
dairies
case,
these
are
all
included
within
the
interior
department
opinion.
that,
in
fact,
it
now,
that
is
in
1943,
some-three
years
after
the
rendition
of
a
prior
opinion,
it
appeared
that
based
on
this
court's
rulings
in
interstate
commerce
cases,
james
v.
--
or
federal
immunity
cases
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
economic
burdens
of
some
state
taxes
might
be
borne
by
the
federal
government
was
not
in
itself
enough
to
infringe
upon
the
immunity
of
the
ultimate
sovereign
in
this
nation,
the
united
states
government
itself.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
not
arguing
estoppel.
i'm
arguing
that
58
i.d.
562
articulates
a
rule
even
under
warren
trading
post
as
it
stands
right
now,
that
where
the
purchase
order
is
issued
to
a
merchant
off
the
reservation,
it
is
subject
to
taxation.
this
in
fact
is
consistent,
at
least
in
arizona's
view,
with
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
including
gurley
v.
rhoden
and
various
other
of
this
court's
decisions
relating
to
the
federal
government's
immunity
from
taxation.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
burger
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
--
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
chief
justice,
in
--
in
that
regard,
and
i
will
apologize
to
the
court,
i
do
not
have
a
transcript
of
the
oral
argument
which
was
held
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
with
respect
to
this,
but
with
due
respect
to
mr.
lewis'
recollection
of
that
argument,
it
is
my
recollection
that
the
position
was
taken
at
that
time
that
where
a
cod
delivery
was
made
on
the
reservation
that
that
indeed,
would
also
be
exempt.
now,
mr.
lewis
made
--
wish
to
correct
me
on
that,
but
that
is
my
recollection.
it
is
the
state
of
arizona's
position
in
this
case
that
if
there
were
a
cod
delivery
on
the
reservation
with
respect
--
well,
in
point
of
fact,
that's
essentially
what
we
have
here.
the
taxable
activity
in
arizona's
estimation,
contrary
and
distinct
from
the
taxpayer's
assertion,
as
well
as
the
united
states,
is
not
the
sale.
arizona
does
not
have
a
sales
tax.
many
other
states
have
sales
taxes,
maryland,
virginia,
indeed,
the
district
of
columbia
has
a
sales
tax.
it
is
an
excise
tax
placed
upon
the
actual
transfer
event.
and
in
general,
indeed,
all
three
of
those
named
jurisdictions
have
a
requirement
that
the
legal
obligation
for
that
tax,
although
there
may
be
a
collection
requirement
from
the
vendor,
ultimately
rests
by
mandate
of
the
organic
law
of
those
jurisdictions
upon
the
vendee.
arizona
does
not
have
that
kind
of
a
law.
it
is
the
transaction
privilege
tax.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
neither
prevents
it
nor
does
it
require
it.
it
is
of
no
moment
to
the
state.
how
the
vendor
goes
about
collecting
this
cost
from
his
customer
is
separate
and
apart
from
whether
or
not
he
has
a
liability
for
it.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that's
correct.
that
arises,
however,
by
virtue
of
contractual
negotiation
and
no
mandate
of
state
law
whatsoever.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
but
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
your
honor,
if
--
if
the
term
“expectation”
is
used
in
the
context
of
a
requirement
of
state
law,
i
would
respectfully
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
as
a
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
yes.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
your
honor
is
quite
correct.
as
a
business
practice,
the
economic
burden
of
the
tax
is
passed
along,
along
with
the
burden
of
all
the
other
costs
the
vendor
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
--
has
including
his
other
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
--
economic
burdens
of
taxes,
his
costs
of
acquisition,
his
labor
expenses,
his
fuel
and
electricity
expenses.
those
are
all
matters
of
contract.
in
this
regard,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
fact
that
the
economic
burden
of
these
taxes
may
be
born
by
an
indian
tribe
or
an
indian
on
the
reservation.
indeed,
might
constitute
nothing
more
than
a
manifestation
of
the
right
--
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
self-government.
one
of
the
attributes
of
the
exercise
of
self-government
surely,
must
be
the
right
to
contract.
they
have
the
right
to
contract
and
negotiate
as
to
the
price,
which
indeed
they
did
as
to
the
price
of
the
tractors
including,
they
have
stipulated,
the
concealed
economic
burdens
of
these
other
taxes.
it
appears
that
the
argument
boils
down
to
nothing
more
than
an
objection
not
to
the
species
of
the
cost,
i.e.
state
tax,
but
rather,
the
visibility
of
the
tax.
for
example,
if
central
machinery
company
had
attempted
to
conceal
the
economic
burden
of
this
$2900
charge
within
the
purchase
price
and
submitted
that
without
a
separate
statement,
the
state
of
arizona
would
submit
that
if
consistency
is
to
be
brought
to
the
taxpayer's
and
united
states'
position,
that
it
would
have
been
approved
because
they
did
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
other
burdens
which
were
concealed.
returning,
if
i
may,
to
the
point
that
arizona
does
not
have
a
transaction
privilege
--
i
--
i'd
to
strike
that,
a
sales
tax.
arizona
indeed
has
a
business
excise
tax.
it
is
denominated
the
arizona
transaction
privilege
tax.
it
has,
as
its
taxable
event,
not
the
sale
transaction,
it
has,
as
its
taxable
event,
engaging
in
business
within
arizona.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
powell,
it
does
not.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
your
honor,
i
--
i
can't
speak
for
the
some-100,000
vendors
in
the
state
of
arizona,
but
the
--
in
--
as
a
general
practice,
yes,
it
is
separately
stated.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
it
does,
indeed.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
hypo
is
the
--
are
all
of
the
negotiations
done
through
the
--
the
out-of-state
vendor?
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
yes.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
yes.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
delivery
on
the
reservation?
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
non-taxable.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
yes.
normally,
there
would
be
a
used
tax
imposed
upon
that.
however,
as
distinguished
from
the
arizona
transaction
privilege
tax
which
has,
as
its
legal
incidence,
the
engaging
of
business,
the
liability
being
upon
the
vendor.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that's
correct.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
from
the
vendee,
gila
river
tribe
--
the
--
the
gila
river
farms?
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
we
could
not
collect
it.
we
would
not
make
any
attempt
to
do
that.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
because
they
are
an
indian
tribe
located
on
an
indian
reservation.
this
court's
decisions
in
bryan
v.
itasca
county
and
mcclanahan
preclude
that.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
apart
from
the
court's
decisions?
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
as
i
understand
the
rationale
of
both
bryan
and
mcclanahan,
the
state
taxes,
in
both
of
those
cases,
which
were
being
attempted
to
be
imposed,
were
sought
to
be
imposed
directly
upon
an
indian
on
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
stevens,
it's
my
--
it's
my
understanding
that
under
the
commerce
clause
as
well
as,
perhaps,
the
supremacy
clause,
the
states
are
without
power
to
impose
the
direct
legal
obligation
for
state
taxes
upon
indians
on
indian
reservations.
this
traces
back
to
this
court's
decision
in
worcester.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
again,
be
--
it's
--
it's
some
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
there'd
been
no
mandate
of
state
law
to
transfer
the
obligation
for
the
tax,
that
is
the
legal
liability
for
the
tax
to
the
vendee
in
arizona,
the
legal
liability
remaining
by
mandate
of
state
law
upon
the
non-indian
central
machinery
company
off
the
reservation.
and
again,
the
taxable
event
being
not
the
sale
but
engaging
in
business
within
arizona.
upon
that
basis,
it
is
arizona's
position
that
the
tax
can
apply.
this
is
consistent,
we
would
submit,
with
numerous
decisions,
most
recent
of
which
is
the
opinion
authored
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
part
four
of
the
moe
decision.
the
--
the
mere
fact
that
the
economic
burdens,
as
opposed
to
the
legal
obligation
for
taxes,
may
be
visited
by
contract
rather
than
state
law
upon
indians,
does
not
per
se
result
in
a
violation
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
--
of
the
indian's
immunity
from
taxation.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
your
honor,
it
may
but
it
escapes
me
why.
in
both
bryan
v.
itasca
county
and
mcclanahan,
we
had
individual
indians
involved.
however,
in
mcclanahan,
part
of
the
rationale
for
the
decision
was
that
the
imposition
of
the
tax
upon
rosalind
mcclanahan
would
interfere
with
the
navajo
tribe's
right
of
self-government.
so,
there
is
a
relationship.
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
a
satisfactory
answer
for
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well,
if
i
may,
by
way
of
further
explanation,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
arizona
believes,
after
an
examination
not
only
of
the
warren
trading
post
decision
but
the
warren
trading
post
briefs
and
indeed,
the
tape
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
warren
trading
post
decision,
maintains
that
these
taxes
are
not
preempted.
they
are
not
preempted.
indeed,
some
40
or
50
minutes
into
the
tape,
counsel
for
warren
trading
post
at
oral
argument
conceded,
and
this
again
gets
into
the
question
of
the
buck
act,
that
if
the
buck
act
applied
to
indian
reservations,
he
would
have
no
case.
he
would
have
no
case.
i
mean,
that
admission
is
made.
that
aside,
the
point
is
that
warren
trading
post,
as
it
stands
right
now
is
distinguishable
from
the
facts
that
we
have
here.
in
warren
trading
post,
both
the
taxable
event,
i.e.
engaging
in
business,
as
well
as
the
measure
of
the
taxable
event,
a
distinct
entity
under
arizona
law
as
confirmed
by
this
court's
decisions
in
gurley
and
rhoden
and
american
--
gurley
v.
rhoden
and
american
oil
v.
neill,
the
measure
of
the
event
also
occurred
on
the
indian
reservation.
we
had
both
things
occurring
on
the
indian
reservation.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
of
the
office
on
the
reservation?
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
fall
within
warren
trading
post
as
a
condition
precedent
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
we've
done
something
like
that,
your
honor
[laughs]
in
the
briefs.
at
least,
we
are
suggesting
that
a
re-examination
of
the
rationale
of
warren
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
--
your
honor
is
correct.
if
indeed
the
court
is
willing
to
at
least
re-examine
the
warren
trading
post
decision,
that
might
be
true.
as
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
--
in
further
response
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that,
under
warren
post,
as
it
stands
right
now,
a
condition
precedent
to
central
machinery
company's
opening
a
branch
office
as
it
were
on
the
reservation
is
the
application
for
and
acquisition
of
a
federal
indian
trader's
license.
there's
no
exception
in
the
statute
that
i
can
see
that
says
that
“well,
we
don't
need
a
license
because,
somehow,
we
are
otherwise
regulated.”
there's
no
exception
like
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
lockwood
in
the
arizona
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
warren
trading
post
case
which
this
course
--
court,
of
course,
overruled.
justice
lockwood
specifically
said
that
the
reason
that
this
is
preempted
is
because
warren
trading
post
had
acquired
a
federal
indian
trader's
license,
was
in
compliance
with
the
federal
statutes,
was
extensively
and
pervasively
regulated
and
therefore,
preemption
must
apply.
indeed,
that
same
rationale
is
advanced
by
warren
trading
post
in
the
oral
argument.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
of
note,
at
least
interest
to
the
state
of
arizona,
is
the
fact
that
central
machinery
company,
in
their
reply
brief,
makes
reference
to
complete
auto
transit
v.
brady,
this
court's
decision
in
complete
auto.
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
one
of
the
rulings,
perhaps
the
major
ruling
in
complete
auto
transit,
is
the
overruling
of
spector
motor
service
v.
o'connor.
spector
motor
service
v.o'connor
was
the
cornerstone
case
in
warren
trading
post's
position.
warren
trading
post
did
not
initially
advance,
as
its
primary
argument,
preemption.
what
it
argued
was
that,
under
spector,
there
is
a
prohibition
upon
state
taxes,
upon
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
and
because
of
that
prohibition
in
spector,
the
state
of
arizona
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
impose
the
tax.
that's
the
same
rationale,
at
least
to
that
point,
that
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
went
through
in
your
food
stores
v.
espanola.
well,
we
have
attempted
in
our
brief
to
trace
the
history
and
underlying
facts
surrounding
the
your
food
stores
decision.
we
also
point
out
that
the
--
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
state
may
impose
a
privilege
tax
on
the
business
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce,
this
court
has
resolved.
that's
what
complete
auto
transit
does.
now,
if
the
argument
is
being
made
that
somehow,
complete
auto
transit
is
relevant
for
purposes
of
saying
that
we
can't
do
this,
that
a
state's
determination,
as
to
the
nature
of
its
tax,
are
not
binding
upon
this
court.
the
fact
remains
that
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
court's
determination
as
to
the
nature
of
its
tax,
as
opposed
to
where
the
legal
incidence
falls,
at
least
in
federal
contexts,
and
we
have
footnoted
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
first
agricultural
bank
and
most
recently,
diamond
national.
that's
a
distinct
consideration
from
the
question
of
the
state
--
the
highest
state
court's
determination
as
to
the
nature
of
its
tax.
arizona's
supreme
court
has
consistently,
since
1935,
when
the
transaction
privilege
tax
was
initially
enacted,
has
construed
it
to
be
a
transaction
privilege
tax.
it
is
not
a
sales
tax.
furthermore,
the
warren
trading
post
case
is
distinguishable
because
the
area
that
has
been
preempted
under
warren
trading
post
is
not
commerce
with
indian
tribes.
moe
establishes
that.
the
area
that
has
been
preempted
is
engaging
in
the
business
of
indian
trading
on
an
indian
reservation.
again,
an
examination
of
the
oral
argument
in
warren
trading
post,
it
does
not
appear
from
the
record,
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
warren
trading
post
briefs,
but
an
examination
of
the
tape
will
reveal
that
some
95%,
95%
of
the
sales
of
warren
trading
post
company
were
with
indians.
this
is
the
only
transaction,
so
far
as
we
know,
that
transpired
between
central
machinery
company
and
the
gila
river
farms.
based
upon
those
facts,
if
it
please
the
court,
it
strikes
arizona
as
being
somewhat
curious
to
characterize
central
machinery
company
as
being
engaged
in
the
business
of
indian
trading
on
an
indian
reservation.
they're
not
indian
traders.
furthermore,
they're
not
itinerant
peddlers.
they're
not
--
they
don't
fall
within
the
class
that
is
entitled
to
hold
either
an
itinerant
peddler's
permit
or
an
indian
trader's
license.
we,
furthermore,
maintain
that
with
respect
to
these
arguments
of
infringement
with
tribal
self-government,
the
decisions
of
this
--
well,
state
court
decisions
in
which
this
court
has
denied
or
dismissed
the
appeal
for
lack
of
substantial
federal
question,
the
kahn
case
and
the
makah
case
are
both
highly
relevant,
particularly
makah.
in
makah,
the
washington
cigarette
tax
was
involved
and
the
taxable
activity,
taxable
event
took
place
off
the
reservation.
there
was
an
increase
in
the
price
to
the
indians.
nevertheless,
the
tax
was
upheld.
the
court
decided
the
decision
in
the
minot
case
in
support
of
that
result,
and
this
court
dismissed.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
quite
the
contrary.
the
position
appears
to
be
that,
under
section
--
25
u.s.c.
section
81,
they
were
in
full
compliance.
they
didn't
need
to
get
a
--
a
trader's
license,
they
didn't
get
--
need
to
get
a
--
an
itinerant
peddler's
permit
because
the
contract
itself
had
been
approved
and
there'd
had
been
this
apparent
pervasive
regulation
that
authorized
it.
there's
no
suggestion,
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
that
they
--
that
the
federal
government
was
doing
anything
other
than
what
it
should
be
doing.
and
what
did
it
do?
it
approved
the
purchase
order.
it
approved
the
economic
burdens
of
the
concealed
state
taxes
within
the
purchase
price.
it
also
approved
the
visible
economic
burden.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
well,
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that
--
that's
correct.
in
the
circumstances
and
facts
of
this
case,
however,
the
city
of
arizona
would
respectfully
submit
that
even
under
the
taxpayer's
argument
supported
by
the
amicus
curiae
that
they
did
everything
they
had
to
do.
they
approved
the
purchase
price.
that
is
consistent
with
58
i.d.
562,
even
if
the
court
is
unwilling
to
re-examine
the
footnote
18
in
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
purchase
order,
which
is
located
in
the
record
at,
as
i
recall,
item
15,
pages
15a.
and
there's
been
a
stipulation
dispensing
to
the
printing
of
the
appendix.
the
purchase
order
has
nothing
on
it
suggesting
that
it's
paid
under
protest.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
the
check
that
subsequently
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
your
honor,
i
find
nothing
in
the
record
that
specifically
states
that.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
excuse
me.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they
are
misleading
us,
perhaps,
or
misleading
the
court
or
counsel
for
arizona.
i
simply
don't
remember
that.
perhaps,
they
can
elaborate
on
that
in
their
reply,
but
i
simply
don't
remember
anything
like
that.
the
first
instance
of
a
protest
with
respect
to
that
separately
stated
charge
shows
up
some
three
days
later,
three
or
four
days
later,
when
the
check
from
gila
river
farms
was
remitted
to
central
machinery
company.
there,
there
is
a
protest
noted
at
the
bottom
of
the
check,
but
there's
nothing
on
the
purchase
order,
it's
a
sales
tax
and
that
is
what
was
paid.
the
amount
of
the
check
--
the
full
amount
of
the
check,
$100,000
plus
was
remitted
to
central
machinery
company.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
sales
tax
was
located
on
the
purchase
order.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
i
see
where
the
court
is
going.[laughter]
there's
no
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
the
fact
is
that
simply
because
the
merchant
may
mischaracterized
the
nature
--
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
--
of
that
expense
does
not
bind
the
state.
i
mean,
he
can't,
by
contract
or
statement,
transform
as
it
were,
the
transaction
privilege
tax.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
indeed,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
in
my
office
in
phoenix.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
i
obtained
it
from
--
i
have
the
--
a
cassette
of
the
tape
right
here.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
national
archives.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
yes,
you
--
yes,
you
can.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
i
stand
corrected,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
a.
macpherson
in
summary,
if
i
may,
it
is
the
state
of
arizona's
position
that
there
is
no
constitutional
prohibition
as
advocated
by
the
amicus
curiae
in
order
to
arrive
at
that
conclusion,
what
you'd
have
to
do,
and
we
say
that
you
should
not
do
that,
has
overruled
the
decision
in
moe.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
that
is
required.
there's
been
a
misanalysis,
a
fundamental
misanalysis
of
the
arizona
transaction
privilege
tax
which
should
dispose
of
the
question
at
the
outset.
we
again
feel
that
warren
trading
post
is
distinguishable.
if
this
court
feels
that
it
is
not
distinguishable,
then
arizona
would
respectfully
submit
that
a
re-examination
of
the
question,
including
an
examination
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
buck
act,
an
examination
of,
for
example,
certain
citations
in
the
solicitor's
opinions
is
required.
thank
you,
your
honor.
