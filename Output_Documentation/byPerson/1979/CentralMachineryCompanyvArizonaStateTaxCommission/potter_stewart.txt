do
i
understand
correctly,
mr.
claiborne,
that
your
--
your
alliance
is
primarily,
if
not
exclusively,
on
the
doctrine
of
warren
trading
post?
justice
potter
stewart
and
don't
you
do
primarily
rely
on
statutory
preemption?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
as
an
indian
commerce
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
original,
they
were
not
reservations,
they
were
just
tribes
that
were
considered
in
the
era
of
the
worcester
case,
a
little
short
of
sovereign
nations
like
england
or
france
or
germany.
and
those
weren't
reservation
indians,
they
were
tribal
nations.
justice
potter
stewart
but
unlike
today
where
indian
reservations
are
federal
lands,
federal
--
in
those
days,
they
were
indian
lands.
justice
potter
stewart
and
indian
sovereign
nations
or
quasi-sovereign
nations.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
point.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
general
practice
is
to
--
the
general
practice
is
to
pass
it
along,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you've
already
told
us
that
was
done
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
understand.
you
told
us
that
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
the
general
practice
and
i
suppose
therefore,
the
expectation
is
that
it
will
be
passed
along
to
the
retail
customer.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
no.
you
told
us
it's
not
required
by
state
law
but
i
asked
you
simply
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
about
the
general
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
to
pass
it
along,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
certainly
ask
us
to,
in
both
this
case
and
the
next
one,
as
i
understand
it,
to
re-examine
what
it
said
in
that
footnote
in
warren
trading
post
about
the
buck
act.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
but
you
submit
that
in
at
least
--
in
this
case
at
least,
that
even
if
we
don't
do
that,
you,
nonetheless,
must
prevail.
