if

and
it
bought
the
truck
off
of
an
automobile
dealer's
light,
taking
the

back
to
the
reservation,
would
that
be
covered
by

your
submission
here
today?

that

you
wouldn't
be
making
the
claim
that
you

suppose

would
not
be
quite
enough.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

does
state
law
require
that
the
amount
of
the
tax
be
disclosed
at
the
time
of
the
transaction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

and
is
it
uniformly
disclosed
as
a
matter
of
practice?
justice

f.
powell,

if
you
bought
an
item
out
of
a
department
store,
would
the

reflect
