justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question?
assume
you
don't
have
that
kind
of--i
want
to
find
out
the
scope
of
the
immunity
that
you're
arguing
for.
supposing
you
had
a
corrupt
parole
official
who
was
asked
to
find
a
trigger
man
to
kill
somebody.
and
the
parole
official
said
to
an
inmate,
"i'll
let
you
out
if
you'll
kill
mr.
x."
and
he
let
him
out.
would
there
be
a
cause--immunity
for
that
kind
of
conduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
concede
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
your
view
is,
that
if
there's
a
cause
of
action,
no
matter
how
extreme
and
no
matter
what
it
covers,
there
is
total
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
general
miller,
would
he
be--wouldn't
he
be
immune
under
the
california
statutes
if
the
decision
was
made--if
it
was
injury
resulting
from
determining
whether
to
parole
or
release
a
prisoner?
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
reads
right
on
my
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
will
vote--i
have
the
authority
to
release
you.
i
will
release
you,
provided
you
agree
to
kill
somebody
i
want
killed.
and
that's
going
to
be
the
real
reason
why
i
do
that.
and
that's
an
injury
resulting
from
determining
whether
to
parole
or
release
a
prisoner,
is
what
the
statute
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell
on
the
fourth
cause
of
action.
the
statute
doesn't
read
on
the--doesn't
provide
immunity
for
incorrect
supervision,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
on
the
revocation.
but
say,
theoretically
at
least,
you
could
have
a
case
in
which
a
parole
officer
might
abuse
his
authority
over
a
particular
parolee,
and
they
can
do
work
for
him,
in
order
to
stay
out.
say
he
just
exploited
his
relationship,
and
made
the
parolee,
just
as
an
example,
made
him
wash
his
car
every
saturday
or
something
like
that;
just
to--would
he
be
immune
from
any
claim
from
the
parolee
for
abuse
of
authority
in
that
kind
of
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
only
go
to
the--basically
to
his
authority
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
man
belonged
on
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
december
of
1969,
a
man
named
thomas
was
convicted
of
attempted
rape
in
california.
he
was
first
committed
to
a
state
mental
hospital
as
a
"mentally
disordered
sex
offender
not
amenable
to
treatment"
and
later
was
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
--
from
one
to
20
years.
after
a
little
over
five
years,
he
was
granted
a
parole
by
the
california
parole
board.
about
five
months
later,
he
committed
another
--
a
very
brutal
crime
resulting
in
a
death
of
a
15-year-old
girl.
the
parents
of
the
15-year-old
girl
brought
this
action
in
the
california
courts
against
the
members
of
the
parole
board,
seeking
to
impose
liability
on
them
for
the
death
caused
to
their
daughter
by
thomas.
the
california
courts
dismissed
the
complaint
holding
that
a
california
statute
granted
members
of
the
parole
board
complete
immunity
and
that
no
federal
claim
was
stated.
the
case
comes
here
by
appeal
since
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
is
in
issue.
this
court
unanimously
affirms
the
holding
of
the
california
court.
we
reject
the
argument
that
the
states
statute
granting
immunity
to
parole
officers
violates
the
federal
constitution
and
--
and
hold
that
the
question
of
whether
to
allow
a
claim
like
this
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
state
court
is
a
matter
for
the
state
of
california
to
decide
without
inhibition
from
the
federal
constitution.
we
also
hold
that
the
action
of
the
members
of
the
parole
board
in
releasing
thomas
did
not
deprive
the
young
girl
of
her
life
without
due
process
of
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
and
therefore,
that
no
cause
of
action
is
stated
under
section
1983
of
the
federal
civil
rights
laws.
we
therefore
--
for
the
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
california.
