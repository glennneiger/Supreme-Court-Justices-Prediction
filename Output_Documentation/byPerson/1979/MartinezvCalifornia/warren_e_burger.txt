we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
martinez
against
california.
mr.
mcgrath,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
quite
a
different
setting,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
safety
is
a
conclusion,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
he's
safe
or
not
is
a
conclusion
which
the
trier
of
fact
must
reach,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
california,
whose
responsible
for
that,
the
judges?
do
they
supervise
the
control--the
probation
officers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
commits
any
other
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens
was
perhaps--was
a
little
too
hasty.
you
said
there'd
be
absolute
immunity.
what
if
the
parole
officer
went
out
and
shot
somebody
himself.
he'd--there'd
be
no
immunity,
would
there?
no
part
of
his
official
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
if
he
hires--if
he
induces
the
parolee
to
kill
someone
on
the
basis
that
he
will
be
released
for
the
purpose,
that's
not
within
the
scope
of
his
official
function,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
really
think--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
indeed
the
parole
board
members
are
liable,
for
a
bad
decision
to
release,
an
erroneous
decision
to
release,
would
it
follow
that
they
would
also
have
some
liability
for
a
wrong
decision
not
to
release?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
deprivation
of
liberty
claimed
by
the
prisoner
who
said,
"i
should
have
been
released
two
years
ago."
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
counsel.
do
you
have
something
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
do
about
a
jury?
suppose
he
had
been
acquitted
by
a
jury,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
verdict.
the
man
was
out
of
the
street,
with
all
of
the
same
propensities,
all
the
same
record
you
have
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
hold
the
jury
liable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
a
bad
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
78-1268,
martinez
against
california
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stevens.
