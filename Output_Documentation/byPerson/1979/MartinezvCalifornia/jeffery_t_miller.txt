mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
turn
initially
to
the
question
of
immunity.
in
the
1983
cases
handed
down
by
this
court,
this
court
has
indicated
that
as
part
of
its
analysis
we
should
enter
into
a
considered
inquiry
into
the
immunity
accorded
the
relevant
public
official
at
common
law,
and
the
public
policy
considerations
in
favor
of
that
immunity.
turning
to
the
history,
the
judicial
history,
of
section
1983,
and
the
question
of
immunity,
with
respect
to
parole
officials
and
their
determinations
to
release
prisoners,
on
parole,
we
see
near-unanimity
in
the
federal
opinions.
the
third,
fourth,
fifth,
sixth
and
ninth
circuits
have
all
unanimously
held
that
there's
an
absolute
quasi-judicial
immunity
which
attaches
to
a
parole
official
in
connection
with
his
determination
to
release
a
prisoner.
no
federal
court
of
appeals
has
decided
to
the
contrary.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
numerous
opinions
issued
by
the
federal
district
courts
for
the
same
proposition.
we've
quoted
extensively
from
the
cases
of
wright
v.
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
and
pate
v.
alabama
board
of
pardons
and
paroles.
in
both
of
those
cases
the
question
of
section
1983
immunity
for
parole
officials
was
placed
in
issue
as
a
result
of
a
parolee
being
released
into
society
and
either
killing
or
seriously
injuring
a
member
of
the
society.
and
in
both
of
those
cases
the
absolute
quasi-judicial
immunity
was
held
to
apply.
against
that
rather
unanimous
backdrop
of
application
and
recognition
of
the
quasi-judicial
immunity
for
parole
officials
for
a
determination
to
release
a
parolee
into
society,
the
appellants
have
been
able
to
cite
only
two
cases,
namely
the
cases
of
grimm
v.
arizona
board
of
pardons
and
paroles,
and
semler
v.
psychiatric
institution
of
washington,
d.c.
semler
was
cited
by
amicus
on
behalf
of
appellant.
we
would
submit
that
neither
one
of
those
cases
is
relevant
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
in
grimm
the
arizona
supreme
court
chose
that
as
a
vehicle
to
abolish
what
had
previously
existed
as
a
common
law
rule
in
arizona
immunizing
all
discretionary--all
administrative
officials
in
connection
with
discretionary
activity.
rather
than
engaging
in
an
analysis
of
the
common
law
history
of
quasi-judicial
immunity
accorded
parole
officials,
rather
than
determining
the
public
policy
considerations
in
favor
of
that
immunity,
the
court
based
its
decision
solely
on
the
question
of,
in
what
branch
of
government
the
position
of,
quote,
parole
official,
reposed
in
arizona.
and
finding
that
it
reposed
in
the
executive
or
administrative
branch,
it
held
that
therefore
judicial
immunity,
or
quasi-judicial
immunity
could
not
attach.
in
the
case
of--well,
it
comes
as
no
surprise
to
us
that
the
majority
opinion
in
grimm
was
mocked
by
the
dissent
and
has
not
been
followed
by
any
other
jurisdiction.
in
semler
v.
psychiatric
institute,
cited
by
amicus
in
support
of
the
appellants,
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
probation
officer
could
be
liable
under
virginia
common
law
in
connection
with
a
ministerial
act
of
negligence
consisting
of
participating
in
the
transference
of
a
dangerous
mental
patient
from
a
high-risk,
high-security
facility
to
a
facility
of
lesser
security.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not
a
1983
case.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
that's
true,
your
honor,
it
was--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
you're
correct,
your
honor.
nothing
involving
federal
law,
but
it
has
been
relied
upon
very
extensively
by
the
appellants
in
their
brief.
and
for
that
matter,
i
thought
it
might
be
referred
to.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
yes,
you're
correct,
your
honor.
after--after
an
inquiry
into
the
judicial
history
of
the
immunity
accorded
the
relevant
public
official,
we
must
engage
in
an
analysis
of
the
public
policy
considerations
in
favor
of
applying
an
immunity.
and
before
engaging
in
a
parity
of
reasoning
between
quasi-judicial
immunity
on
the
part
of
judges
and
prosecutors,
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
we
cited
in
our
brief,
i'd
like
to
make
a
few
remarks
concerning
the
unique
discretionary
nature
of
the
parole
process.
this
court,
in
1972,
in
the
case
of
morrissey
v.
brewer,
indicated
that
for
the
past
60
years
the
process
of
releasing
prisoners
on
parole
had
become
an
integral
part
of
our
penological
system;
that
the
purpose
of
parole
is
to
reintegrate
officials
into
society
as
constructive
individuals
as
soon
as
they
are
able,
without
confining
them
for
the
terms
of
the
sentence
imposed,
and
that
the
process
of
parole
mitigates
the
cost
to
society
of
keeping
people
incarcerated.
in
the
recent
case
of
greenholtz
v.
nebraska
penal
inmates,
decided
may
31st
of
this
year,
this
court
painted
a
very
comprehensive
picture
of
the
unique
and
discretionary
nature
of
the
parole
process.
the
court
all
but
implied
it's
a
fragile
process,
still
in
the
experimental
stage,
and
it
consists
of
a
synthesis
of
record
fact
and
personal
observation
of
the
parole
official,
filtered
through
the
sum
total
of
his
experience,
and
resulting
in
an
equity
type
of
judgment,
taking
into
account
psychological,
sociological,
biological
and
genetic
factors
of
the
individual
under
consideration;
and
that
that
kind
of
decision
does
not
always
lend
itself
to
traditional
finding
of
fact
or
conclusions
of
law.
it
emphasizes
not
what
a
man
has
done,
but
what
a
man
is
and
what
a
man
can
become.
and
it's
against--it's
against
that
backdrop,
that
critical
and
unique
purpose
of
parole,
that
we
must
engage
in
an
inquiry
of
the
public
policy
considerations
in
favor
of
granting
quasi-judicial
immunity
to
parole
officials.
in
1967,
this
court,
in
one
of
its
cases,
recognized
the
common
law
immunity
which
benefitted
judges
from
civil
liability
in
connection
with
the
1983
action.
that
was
pierson
v.
ray.
and
in
1976,
in
the
landmark
case
of
imbler
v.
pachtman,
this
court
extended
that
rule
of
immunity
to
state
prosecutors
upon
the
rationale
that
to
permit
angry
or
disgruntled
litigants
to
file
lawsuits
against
these
officials
alleging
reckless
or
improper
conduct
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
these
decision-making
processes.
and
that
chilling
effect
would
result
in
harassment
and
intimidation,
rather
than
fearless
and
principled
decision-making.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
first,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we
can't
see
how
the
principle
of
semler
is
at
all
relevant
to
this
kind
of
an
inquiry.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
my
understanding
of
the
opinion
was
that
the
official
in
question
was
not
exercising
any
discretionary
or
quasi-judicial
function
in
that
case,
but
was
merely
engaging
in
a
ministerial
kind
of
activity
and--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
furthermore,
with
respect
to
that
point,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
semler,
a
fourth
circuit
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
did
not
modify,
nor
even
question,
its
own
rule
of
absolute
quasi-judicial
immunity
that
it
had
already
recognized
in
favor
of
parole
officials
in
connection
with
a
determination
to
release
or
to
deny
release,
to
a
parolee.
we
believe
there's
a
parity
of
reasoning
between
the
public
policy
considerations
in
favor
of
prosecutors
and
judges
and
granting
them
immunity
and
granting
a
quasi-judicial
immunity
for
parole
officials.
as
it
was
foreseeable
on
the
part
of--in
the
context
of
a
state
prosecutor
that
numerous
lawsuits
could
be
filed
by
unhappy
litigants
unable
to
accept
the
wisdom
of
the
result
of
a
particular
case,
we
can
perceive
a
multitude
of
lawsuits
being
filed
by
victims
of
violent
crime
committed
by
parolees
who
will
transmute
the
loss,
the
shock,
the
wrath,
and
the
other
emotions
they've
suffered
into
ascriptions
of
reckless
and
improper
conduct
against
a
parole
official,
allegations
that
are
easily
made
and,
in
the
absence
of
a
total
quasi-judicial
immunity,
can
only
be
disproven
with
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
that
would
deflect
a
great
deal
of
energy
and
time
on
the
part
of
parole
officials
from
making
these
important
decisions
to
defending
past
decisions.
and
in
some
cases,
decisions
that
have
taken
place
years
before
they
will
have
to
come
into
court
and
establish
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
jury
good
faith.
that
imposes
an
intolerable
burden.
furthermore,
the
court
indicated
in
imbler
that
it
would
be
highly
improper
and
risky
to
permit
lay
juries
to
pass
on
technical
issues
such
as
prosecutorial
strategy
of
what
witnesses
to
call,
what
evidence
to
seek
introduction
of,
what
kind
of
a
case
to
prosecute.
we
feel
there's
a
parity
of
reasoning
there
because
if
we
were
to
open
up
the
door
even
a
crack
to
liability
on
the
part
of
parole
officials
under
1983,
juries
would
be
expected
to
resolve
issues
such
as
the--all
of
the
individualized
and
highly
subjective
issues
which
argue
in
favor
of
release
for
a
particular
individual.
the
jury
would
be
responsible
for
assimilating
the
sum
total
experience
of
a
parole
official.
for
as
greenholtz
instructs,
the
process
of
parole
is
a
synthesis
of
record
fact
and
personal
observation
of
the
parole
official
filtered
through
his
own
career,
his
own
experience.
and
we
would
put
a
jury
in
the--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
still
argue
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
there
would.
the
actual--the
actual
cause
of
action
under
1983
would
be
immune.
however,
we
feel
that--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
no,
your
honor,
we
don't.
we
feel
that
there's
no
cause
of
action
stated
under
1983.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
yes,
in
the
example--in
the
hypothetical
you
posed,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
would
be
our
position.
and
we
would
analogize
that
to
the
state
prosecutor,
for
example,
suborning
perjury.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
it's--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
it's
arguably
within
the--he
is
exercising
a
power.
he
is
a
exercising
a
jurisdiction.
and
that
jurisdiction
is
exercised
by
his
decision-making
process.
and
if,
in
california,
one
parole
official
had
that
kind
of
power,
and
if
a
prospective
parolee
was
before
him
eligible
for
parole;
and
if
he
made
that
kind
of
decision
and
released,
pursuant
to
some
kind
of
conspiracy
or
agreement
this
individual
into
society,
i
think
it's
arguable
that
he
would
still
be
immune
under
1983
liability
as
he
did
not
clearly--he
did
not
act
in
clear
excess
of
his
jurisdiction.
the
test--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
exactly.
exactly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist;
he
would.
and
that
would
be
the
judicial
check
on
that
kind
of
abuse
of
powers.
we--getting
back
to
the
public
policy
considerations
in
favor
of--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
your
question,
mr.
justice
stevens,
is
whether
or
not--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
i
think
the
motivation
or
the
intention
behind
an
actual
release
in
any
particular
case
is
irrelevant;
and
certainly,
if
this
case
had
been
brought
solely
under
california
common
law
we
would
have
urged,
as
we
did
in
this
case,
the
application
of
the
immunity
under
845
point--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
in
that
kind
of
a
hypothetical,
i
don't
think
he
would,
mr.
justice
white;
where
the
individual
was
actually
out
on
parole,
and
they
entered
into
a
private
agreement
for
the
purpose
of
taking
the
life
of
a
member
of
society,
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
immunity,
under
1983.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
i
will
address
it
now,
mr.
justice
powell.
first
of
all,
we
don't
feel
that
the--that
that
matter
has
even
been
briefed
by
the
appellants
in
this
case.
they
seem
to
rely
solely
on
the
decision
to
release
aspect
of
this
case
for
purposes
of
alleging
a
1983
claim
exists.
but
we
would
also
submit
that
the
process
of
supervision
is
but
a
finely
spun
attenuation
of
the
determination
to
release
itself.
supervision
involves
making
sure
that
the
terms
and
conditions
of
a
parole
are
being
complied
with.
and
that
kind
of
activity
has
relevance
only
insofar
as
a
decision
to
revoke
parole
may
be
made,
or
a
decision
not
to
revoke
parole.
that
kind
of
activity
doesn't
exist
in
the
abstract.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
it
has
relevance
to
further
a
decision-making
process
for
which,
we
would
argue,
the
parole
official
is
absolutely
immune
under
the
quasi-judicial
immunity.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
individual
parole
agents,
parole
officers
do
that.
and
they
are
employed
by
the
department
of
corrections;
they
are
not
employed
by
the
adult
authority,
which
was
the
board
empowered
to
make
decisions
to
release
parolees
when
this
case
arose.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
no,
they
are
not,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
the
statute
does
not
make
any
express
reference
to
the
supervision
of
parolees
once
they've
been
released,
mr.
justice
stevens.
however,
the
adult
authority
was
given
the
power
to
adopt
terms
and
conditions
of
parole,
and
presumably,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
parole
may
be
related
to
the
supervisorial
process.
however
california
law
itself
has
acknowledge,
we
have
case
law
in
california
to
the
effect
that,
the
function
of
parole
supervision
is
part
and
parcel
of
a
decision
to
release,
for
the
reasons
that
i've
previously
indicated,
that--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
no,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
would
not
argue
that.
but
that
would
be
outside
the
context
of
his
authority,
of
his
jurisdiction.
and
there--and
liability
could
lie
for
whatever
tort--
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
certainly
be
a
logical
result;
and
that
would
even
create
a
greater
burden
on
this
vital
aspect
of
our
rehabilitation
process.
we
feel
that
under
that
kind
of
pressure--we
feel,
in
the
initial
case,
that
any
prospect
of
liability
under
1983
for
the
determination
of
a
release
of
a
prisoner,
whether
it
comes
from
a
member
of
the
public
victimized
by
a
parolee,
or
from
an
inmate
who
has
been
denied
parole,
would
create
a
chilling
process--a
chilling
effect
on
the
ability
of
the
individuals
to
exercise
the
vast
amount
of
discretion
we
repose
in
them
for
the
purpose
of
vindicating
this
aspect
of
our
penological
system.
we
feel--getting
back
to
the
question
of
the
incredible
burden
that
we
would
impose
on
juries,
we
feel
that
juries
would
be
presented
with
all
kinds
of
highly
technical
and
improper
decisions
for
them
to
make,
such
as
the
predictability
of
violence
in
general
terms,
and
also
in
specific
terms
with
respect
to
a
particular
parolee;
and
that
ultimately
they
would
be
required
to
come
up
with
the
ultimate
finding
of
fact,
in
the
form
of
a
jury
verdict,
a
process
which
this
court
has
already
acknowledged
is
not
appropriate
for
the
kind
of
determination
that
a
parole
official
will
have
to
make.
these
decisions
will
be
made
in
an
emotional
melting
pot,
with
the
benefit
of
20-20
hindsight;
and
it'll
be
easy
for
a
jury
to
ascribe
reckless
conduct
or
improper
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
parole
official
in
an
emotional
reaction
to
the
gravity
of
the
offense
that
was
committed.
so
our
position
is
that
we
should
not--we
should
not
submit
parole
officials
to
make
this
treacherous
choice
of
opting
for
continued
confinement
for
their
own
personal
protection
on
the
one
hand,
and
opting
for
the
release
of
an
individual
into
society
at
the
risk
of
incurring
personal
liability.
we
feel
that
that
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
this
decision-making
process,
and
result
in
thousands
upon
thousands
of
inmates
throughout
the
penal
institutions
in
our
country
worthy
of
parole
being
incarcerated
longer
for
unjustifiable
periods
of
time.
furthermore,
if
we
were
to
impose
liability
under
section
1983
in
this
particular
set
of
circumstances,
and
appellants
have
argued
that
we
should
impose
liability
only
for
gross
negligence
or
recklessness,
we
would
in
effect
be
creating
a
privileged
class
of
crime
victims,
if
you
will
those
people
victimized
by
recidivistic
acts
committed
by
parolees
who
have
been
released
as
a
function
of
gross
negligence
or
other
grievous
misconduct.
crime
victims
who
suffer
at
the
hands
of
parolees
who
haven't
been
released
as
a
result
of
any
improprieties
would
have
no
redress
under
1983,
nor
would
people
victimized
by
probationers,
or
first
time
criminals,
for
that
matter.
mr.
jeffery
t.
miller
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
statute
in
question
in
no
way
abridges
the
common
law
right
of
the
individual
to
proceed
against
a
person
who
committed
the
offense.
and
furthermore,
in
california
we
feel
that
we
dealt
with--or
we're
in
the
process
of
dealing
with
the
separate
question
of
compensating
people
in
a
more
appropriate
manner
than
imposing
liability
on
the
part
of
parole
officials.
in
california,
we've
adopted
a
comprehensive
scheme
known
as
the
victim
of
violent
crimes
legislation,
whereby
we
compensate,
to
a
limited
degree,
and
within
the
context
of
special
damages
suffered
by
individuals,
victims
of
all
crime,
not
just
crime
committed
by
released
parolees
or
released
probationers
or
first-time
criminals.
furthermore--and
this
gets
into
the
area
of
what
alternative
means
there
are
which
might
be
preferable
to
section
1983
in
california
at
the
time
this
happened,
and
at
the
present
day,
we
can
promptly
remove
a
parole
official
who
is
incompetent
or
can't
exercise
his--the
discretion
that
is
reposed
in
him,
or
for
any
other
reason.
we
can
also
reduce
the
amount
of
discretion
that
we
vest
in
parole
officials,
and
provide
for
a
greater
involvement
of
interested
law
enforcement
agencies
and,
indeed,
the
public,
as
we've
done
in
california.
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
because
of
the
absence
of
formalistic
judicial
safeguards
the
parole
process
is
not--is--should
be
controlled
by
the
imposition
of
tort
liability
upon
parole
officials.
and
in
their
briefs
the
appellants
made
reference
to
the
quasi-judicial--not
the
quasi-judicial,
but
the
judicial
safeguards
enunciated
by
this
court
in
butz
v.
economou,
and
indicate
that
in
the
absence
of
that
kind
of
safeguard
liability
should
be
imposed
as
a
necessary
check.
first
of
all,
the
butz
opinion
itself
did
not
impose
as
a
condition
precedent
the
existence
of
any
judicial
safeguards
on
the
federal
administrative
law
process
before
it
granted--before
it
decided
it
was
to
grant
quasi-judicial
immunity
to
administrative
law
judges
and
prosecuting
attorneys
within
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government.
and
furthermore,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
stump,
particularly
in
footnote
12
of
stump,
there
are
all
kinds
of
activities
in
which
a
judge
may
engage
which
are
outside
the
adversarial
process,
such
as
the
decision
to
issue
a
search
warrant,
or
issue
an
ex
parte
order
such
as
a
temporary
restraining
order.
and
there
are
no
procedural
safeguards
at
that
particular
time,
but
we
have
still
recognized
absolute
immunity
in
that
kind
of
a
context.
within
the
context
of
prosecutors,
we
will
totally
immunize
them
for
many
of
their
decisions
which
are
ex
parte,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
in
nature,
which
are
not
made
within
the
context
of
the
adversary
process,
such
as
a
decision
of
when
to
prosecute
a
case,
what
case
to
prosecute,
what
evidence
to
seek
introduction
of
and
what
witnesses
to
call.
finally,
we
turn
to
the
subject
that
the
parole
decision
itself
really
does
not
lend
itself
to
the
adversary
process.
it's
a
quasi-judicial
function
outside
the
traditional
mold
of
adjudication,
as
the
court
indicated
in
greenholtz,
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
equitable,
and
intangible,
and
highly
subjective
factors
to
be
taken
into
account,
and
the
process
results
in
an
equity
kind
of
predictive
judgment,
not
a
traditional
finding
of
fact.
it's
been
likened
by
this
court
in
greenholtz
to
the
sentencing
judge's
choice,
and
in
williams
v.
new
york
this
court
held
that
in
the
context
of
sentencing
there
were
no
due
process
or
other
requirements
which
could
justify
the
injection
into
a
sentencing
process
of
the
right
to
counsel
or
formalistic
rules
of
evidence;
because
if
that
were
done,
as
the
court
recognized
in
williams,
we
would
have
a
situation
where
judges
would
not
be
able
to
rely
on
information
in
which--upon
which
they
traditionally
rely
for
that
important
decision,
such
as
probation
reports
and
other
information.
the
court
indicated
that
that
kind
of
information
won't
normally
come
in
under
classic
rules
of
evidence.
it
furthermore
will
impose
a
great
burden
on--a
great
cost
burden
on
society.
my
final
remark
with
respect
to
appellant's
contention
that
we
need
judicial
safeguards
in
this
area
is
that
if
we
were
to
impose
that
kind
of
condition,
we
feel
that
it
will
be
done
at
the
risk
of
creating
a
greater
self
consciousness
of
the
quasi-judicial
function
of
the
parole
decision,
which
in
and
of
itself
could
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
process.
it
could
be
transformed
into
a
prosecutorial
environment
where
the
emphasis
would
not
be
placed
upon
rehabilitation
of
the
individual
but
rather
on
continued
and
unjustified
confinement.
thank
you.
