justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
miller,
let
me
go
back
to
semler.
i
take
it
you
feel
your
case
is
just
as
solid
if
we
went
along
with
the
principle
in
semler?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
they
didn't
stop
at
the
break
that
semler
would
represent,
to
wit,
the
ministerial
act
as
distinguished
from
the
other.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
therefore
i
ask
you
whether
the
semler
decision
is
at
all
embarrassing
to
your
decision;
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is
no?
