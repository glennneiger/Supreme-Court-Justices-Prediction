justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
claim
that
the
defendants
here,
or
the
respondents,
should
be
treated
as
if
they
were
the
parents
or
owners
of
the
criminal
actor,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
restatement
isn't
talking
about
public
officials.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
judge,
faced
with
these
same
facts,
had
decided
to
grant
probation
rather
than
sentence
and
confine,
and
the
next--10
days
later
the
person
commits
another
rape?
would
you
say
that
the
judge
was
liable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how--why
is
there
that
much
difference
between
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the--nobody
had
any
right
to
appeal
when
a
judge
sentences
someone,
says,
"i'll
give
you
probation
instead
of
putting
you
in
jail
for
10
years."
the
state
has
no
right
to
appeal
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
other
hand,
your
opponent
urged
that
the
judgment
below
be
upheld
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
violation
of
constitutional
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
scheuer
argument
seems
to
me
to
lack
a
good
deal
in
analogy,
because
there
the
national
guard
troops
were
at
least
arguably
the
agents
of
governor
rhodes.
and
here,
certainly,
the
person
paroled
was
not
the
agent
of
the
parole
board.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
don't
you
have
a
break
in
causation
of
some
sort
when
you
got
to
a
private
individual
who
is--by
hindsight,
obviously,
mistakenly
released,
but
who
is
not
a
state
employee,
who
is
detained
against
his
will
by
the
state
for
a
period
of
time
and
then
finally
released?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
direct--the
parole
board
didn't
send
thomas
out
to
represent
the
parole
board,
or
to
act
for
it.
it
simply
returned
thomas
to
private
life.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
quite
a
different
inquiry.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
judge
are
above
the
law,
according
to
stump
v.
sparkman.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
judges
may
make
just
as
botched
up
decisions
as
parole
officers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
also
true
with
respect
to
semler
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
looked
to
virginia
law,
and
if
one
were
to
perform
the
analogous
function
here
of
looking
to
california
law,
clearly
california
law
says
there
should
be
no
liability.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
he
not
be
subject
to
liability
though
under
california
criminal
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
california
law,
i
assume
that
the
victim
here
had
a
tort
cause
of
action
against
the
actor,
whether
or
not
he
was
judgment-proof
i
suppose
might
be
a
question;
but
there's
no
question
of
immunity
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
actually
raped
her?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
go
to
the
california
legislature
tomorrow
and
get
them
to
pass
a
law
that
gives
damages
in
your
situation,
can't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
you're
talking
about
general
policy
terms
about
why
we,
the
public,
shouldn't
have
to
endure
this.
i
mean,
the
california
legislature
could
change
it
over
night.
