justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcgrath,
it's
a
deprivation
of
life
without
due
process
of
law,
isn't
that
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
failure
to
follow
due
process
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
some
evidence
or
some
practice
of
letting
people
out
at
a
certain
stage
of
their
incarceration
that
would
support
the
decision
to--wasn't
it
arguable
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
have
been
let
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
doesn't
that
go
to
the
merits
of
decision
as
to
whether
to
grant
him
parole,
rather
than
the
procedure
followed
by
the
parole
board?
are
you
challenging
the
procedure
that
the
parole
board
followed?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
there
was
no
due
process
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
was
the
error
in
procedure
that
you
allege?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
made
an
incorrect
decision.
is
that
an
error
in
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcgrath,
doesn't
the
case
come
to
us
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
basis
for
the
decision
below
was
immunity.
and
so
we
approach
it
on
the
basis
that
even
if
there
was
a
good
cause
of
action
stated,
even
if
there
was
a
knowing
violation,
a
deliberate
violation,
there
is
immunity.
isn't
that
the
basis
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
join
the
parole
officer
as
a
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
pinning
the
case
not
on
release
but
on
lack
of
supervision?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcgrath,
just
so
i
can
be
sure
i
have
your
case,
you're--we're
only
concerned
with
the
fifth
cause
of
action
in
your
complaint,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
allegations.
is
it
perfectly
clear
to
you
that
the
california
court
rejected
the
fifth
claim
on
the
basis
of
the
california
immunity
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
just
end
up
by
saying
there's
no
liability
to
plead
under
the
civil
rights
act.
and
i
think
it's
arguable
in
their
opinion
that
they
were
just
saying
there's
no
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
don't
cite
the
statute
in
their
rejection
of
that--the
fifth
claim,
in
that
portion
of
their
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
federal
cases
on
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
fitzgerald
v.
procunier.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i--the
question
i'm
asking
you
is,
i
don't
really
think
it's
fair
to
say
they
relied
on
the
california
statute
in
disposing
of
that
claim.
that's
what
i
really
wanted
to
suggest
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcgrath,
i
just
have
to
question
you
once
more
about
this
notion
of
being
above
the
law.
there's
no
suggestion
that,
in
anything
other
than
the
performance
of
his
regular
job,
this
individual,
or
indeed
the
judge
in
the
stump
case,
was
above
the
law.
the
question
is
whether
the
law
gives
a
damage
remedy
when
someone
is
performing
his
official
duty;
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
you
could
say
there
are
two
grounds
that--for
liability,
one
is
the
release,
which
you
say
there
is
absolute
immunity
for;
but
you
wouldn't
claim
any
immunity
for
conspiring
with
somebody
else
to
kill
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you--if
the
parole
officer
went
around
to
a
prisoner
and
said,
"why
don't
you
escape
and
i'll
pay
you
and
you
kill
this
fellow?"
or
after
he
was
out
and
already
paroled,
on
parole,
if
his
parole
officer
said,
"why
don't
you
kill
this
fellow
and
i'll
pay
you?"
he
certainly
wouldn't
be
immune,
would
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
couldn't
state
a
cause
of
action.
