mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
instant
case
involves
three
participants,
one
an
innocent
14-year-old--or
15-year-old
girl;
the
other
a
hopelessly
and
terrible
sexual
psychopath;
and
the
third,
his
legal
guardian,
state
parole
officials
of
the
state
of
california.
the
two
former
individuals'
paths
crossed
in
tecolote
canyon,
san
diego,
california,
in
august
of
1975,
and
mary
ellen
martinez
came
away
the
loser,
for
she
was
brutally
murdered
by
june-jordan
thomas.
thomas,
on
the
other
hand,
was
returned
to
the
place
from
which
he
never
should
have
been
released,
the
state
prison.
indeed,
had
this
been
a
case
of
owners
of
a
dangerous
animal
who
allowed
that
animal
to
get
loose
and
do
injury,
we
would
have
long
since
had
a
verdict
favorable
to
our
clients
in
the
lower
court.
this
individual
was
released
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
1969
he
terrorized
young
females
of
the
same
age
category
that
mary
ellen
was
in.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
the
chief
justice,
when
he
was
on
the
court
of
appeals,
stated
in
a
case
called
kaiser
v.
reed
that
there
is
a
parens--patria
relationship
between
parole
officials
and
prisoners.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
but
it
was
a
good
quote
for
the
purposes
of
argument.
i
think
that--[laughter]
--
your
honor,
it
isn't
that
much
different.
they
let
these
people
go
when
they
know
they're
dangerous.
and
the
restatement
tells
us
that
someone
who
is
in
charge
of
a
known
dangerous
entity
or
animal
or
person
and
releases
that
person
should
be
held
liable
for
the
consequences
of
the
actions
of
the
person
released.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
it
doesn't
delineate
between
categories
of
people.
but
it
holds
responsibility
or
accountability
for
someone
under
your
control
who
is
hopelessly,
incurably
insane
is
released
in
the
public,
there
must
be
liability,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
i
would
say
so,
but
i
would
follow
the
law
in
stump
v.
sparkman
and
say
he
cannot
be
liable.
he's
absolutely
immune.
but
only
that
class
of
individual;
not
this
class.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
because
the
procedural
safeguards
set
down
by
this
court
in
the
butz
case
says,
we
look
to
see
what
due
process
is
available.
with
the
judge,
there
is
appeals,
there
is
transcripts,
there
is
right
to
counsel,
public
hearing,
open
courtrooms.
this
little
girl,
the
only
thing
she
did
wrong
was
put
on
her
sandals.
and
she
never
had
any
of
those
things.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
but
the
public
policy
set
down
by
the
court
in
stump
v.
sparkman
and
imbler,
and
no
further
yet,
is
that
the
judiciary
must
be
kept
separate.
the
judiciary
is
faced
with
an
inherent
conflict
of
interest
in
hiring
counsel
from
the
executive
branch.
these
officials
are
executives.
and
they
don't,
in
their
own
realm,
they're
not
voted
in,
they're
not
elected,
they're
not
controlled
by
anybody.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
it's
a
difficult
area
for
us,
your
honor,
but
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
all
right.
on
the
first
question,
i
say
scheuer
v.
rhodes;
exact
same
facts
-
wrongful
death;
violation
1983;
parents
asserting
rights;
code
sections
the
same;
our
wrongful
death
the
same
as
the
ohio
statute.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
but,
your
honor,
that's
where
i
have
trouble,
is
to
determine
whether
the
defendant
is
acting
in
good
faith.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
we've
stated
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
for
the
deprivation
of
the
right
of
this
little
girl's
life.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
the
defendant
knew,
or
should
have
known,
as
the
court
said
in
wood
v.
strickland,
that
the
medical
people,
the
psychiatric
people,
in
california
said
thomas
was
hopelessly
incurable.
and
judge
neilsen,
when
he
sentenced
him,
said
"don't
let
him
out
until
you
either
cure
him
or
the
full
term
goes
by."
instead,
they
let
him
out
in
four
years
instead
of
twenty.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
no,
i
don't--i
think
that
it
was
arguable
that
a
lot
of
prisoners
got
out
early
because
of
an
overcrowding
situation.
but
this
man
was
medically
incurable.
and
i
take
him
as
a
separate,
distinct
individual.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
i'm
challenging--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
challenging
the
procedure.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
they
ignored
his
known
dangerous
propensities,
and
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
cured.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
well,
the
steps--i
suppose
you
can--it's
mixed
procedure
and
substance.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
they
ignored
their
own
procedures
in
that
they
should
check
to
see
that
a
person
was
safe
to
let
into
the
community.
they
did
not
check
to
do
that.
i
mean,
he
was
not
safe.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
the
problem
was--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
sir
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
trier
of
facts.
we've
never--so
many
of
these
questions
i
can't
answer,
because
we
were
stopped,
as
was
scheuer,
and--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
i
believe
that's
the
basis,
and
i
think
that's
what
justice
stewart
was
trying
to
tell
me
to
confine
me
to.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
well,
that's
why
i
said
that
i
thought
justice
stewart
put
me
in
a
position
where
i
had
to
answer
both
questions.
a,
a
fundamental
right
to
life.
b,
what
standard
of
immunity,
be
it
absolute,
as
the
state
wishes--state's
attorney,
or
be
it
qualified,
as
the
chief
justice
held
in
scheuer.
the
fundamental
right
is
a
right
to
life
that's
been
denied.
and,
as
justice
white
says,
we--you
take
our
facts
as
true,
so
we've
stated
a
cause
of
action.
now,
what's
the
standard?
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
no,
but
the
patrolling
officer
was
the
agent
of
the
higher
authority
of
the
state,
just
as
was
governor
rhodes.
i
don't
have
any
trouble
with--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
no,
sir,
no
more
than
the
national
guardsmen.
i
think
the
scheuer
case
is
harder
than
our
case.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
the--after
the
fact,
the
supervisory
officer?
is
that
what
you
mean,
your
honor?
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
we
have
numerous
does
but--and
we
suspect
a
lack
of
supervision
of
this
individual,
and
we've
generally
pled
it.
but
we
don't
know
the
name
of
his
parole
officer,
for
we
were
stopped
at
the
demur
stage
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
i
think
we're
pinning--primarily
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
but
we're
alleging
in
the
alternative,
as
we're
allowed
to
do
under
our
law
and
under
federal
law,
each
and
every
cause
of
action
we
suspect.
but
supervision
subsequently,
we
suspect
there
was
a
lack
of
supervision.
and
we'd
like
the
opportunity
to
discover
that
issue.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
no,
the
parole
department,
an
executive
branch,
supervises
the
parole
or
probation
officers,
it's
an
executive
function,
not
judicial.
we
state,
your
honors,
that
in
contravention
of
this
man's
known
dangerous
propensities
he
was
released
into
the
community
prematurely.
the
martinez
family
asked,
by
filing
their
complaint,
and
believed,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act.
they
further
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due
process
clause,
had
been
violated.
they
believe
they
could
prove
the
facts
they
allege
in
their
complaint,
and
they
believe
the
right
to
life
was
violated
and
was
a
fundamental
right.
they
believe
these
officials
should
be
held
accountable,
just
as
was
the
governor
and/or
the
national
guard
in
scheuer
v.
rhodes.
they
were
turned
down
by
all
of
the
courts
of
california.
accordingly,
we
are
here.
immunity
has
been
held
to
be
the
exception;
accountability,
the
rule.
this
court
has
not
allowed
1983
to
be
circumvented
by
immunity
claims.
it's
been
so
held
in
scheuer
v.
rhodes,
in
wood
v.
strickland
and
in
procunier
v.
navarette.
indeed,
this
court
held
in
butz
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
state
to
show
the
need
for
an
absolute
immunity.
we
return
again
to
scheuer
and
state,
our
claims
are
exactly
the
same.
for
therein,
they
claimed
an
absolute
immunity,
the
governor
did;
therein,
the
case
was
prematurely
dismissed
at
the
very
earliest
stage;
therein,
the
governor
abused
his
discretion,
called
out
the
national
guard,
an
injury
occurred;
herein--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
as
i
recall
it
did
not.
the
subject
was
argued,
but
the
holding--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
and
they
were
in
a
federal
court,
we're
in
our
own
state
court.
as
i
recall
the
briefs
of
appellant,
there
was
a--it
was
not
a
claim
of
absolute
immunity.
what
form
it
came
under,
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
there
was
as
to
the
executive
function,
and
the
emergency
of
the
governor
needing
to
call
out
the
national
guard,
the
lack
of
foreseeability
-
calling
out
national
guard,
would
that
kill
students
at
kent
state?
our
case,
we
think,
is
better
on
the--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
being
on
appeal,
we're
not
always
sure
just
exactly
what
you
want
us
to
address.
there,
in
scheuer
as
here,
there
was
a
wrongful
death
action.
there,
there
were
violations
of
1983
fundamental
rights.
we
believe
this
case
is
on
all
fours
with
scheuer
v.
rhodes.
we
understand
the
state's
position
is
that
parole
is
a
difficult
decision,
and
there's
a
lot
of
discretion
involved.
we
have
a
hard
time
understanding
how
there
would
be
more
discretion
in
parole
than
being
the
governor
of
a
state
of
this
union.
we
think
that
if
the
state's
position
is
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion,
then
the
cases
allowing
policemen
to
be
sued
must
be
overruled.
for
policemen
have
the
ultimate
discretion,
much
more
so
than
parole
officials.
they
can
take
a
life
in
an
instant;
they
can
take
liberty
in
an
instant.
we
don't
think
that's
the
court's
position.
we
think
the
state
in
navarette
v.
procunier,
admitted
that
the
same
procunier
we
sue
here
today
was
only
qualifiedly
immune
by
admission
in
navarette.
here,
mr.
procunier
claims
absolute
immunity.
we
believe
the
test
of
wood
follows,
that
these
parole
officials
knew,
or
should
have
known,
when
they
released
june-jordan
thomas,
that
he
would
have
committed
a
crime
similar
to
the
one
committed,
and
his
victim
was
more
foreseeable
than
was
the
students
in
scheuer
v.
rhodes.
for
indeed,
thomas
had
molested
girls
of
tender
age
in
tecolote
canyon
in
'69;
as
soon
as
he
was
released,
shortly
thereafter,
he
returned
to
tecolote
canyon
and
killed
a
girl
of
tender
age.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
your
honor,
and
its
incorporation
of
the
other
causes
of
action.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
i
didn't
feel
they
said
that.
i
felt
they
said
that
in
this
fact
situation,
that
absolute
immunity
was
appropriate
to
achieve
the
goal
of
the
state.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
it
may
not
be
in
that
particular
portion,
but
i
found
them
discussing
1983
fairly
carefully
at
one
point.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
i
can't
say
i
agree
or
disagree.
i
don't
they
discussed
it.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
but
when
you
lose
at
that
level,
you
don't
think
they
even
saw
the
1983.
i
don't
think
they
knew
of
scheuer
at
that
time,
or
they
didn't
understand
the
impact
of
it.
i
thought
that
your
dissent
in
procunier,
your
honor,
was
the
test.
we've
got
an
affirmative
defense
being
alleged,
and
we
get
knocked
out
at
the
demur
stage.
what
you
said
is,
let's
look
at
the
official
and
his
job
function.
let's
see
if
he
was
in
good
faith.
if
not,
we
create
a
rebuttable
presumption.
and,
as
justice
burger
said,
then
we
go
to
summary
judgment,
and
it
gets
tougher.
but
i
think
we
should
be
able
to
go
back
and
rebut
that
presumption
of
good
faith.
and
we
think
the
grimm
v.
state
of
arizona
case
is
a
logical
extension,
that
those
who
act
grossly
negligently
cannot
be
absolutely--or
qualifiedly
immune,
or
they
are
not
acting
in
good
faith.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
no,
sir.
i
think
that
my
opening
statement--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
at
the
governor's--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
no,
sir,
the
governor
sent
the
national
guard
out.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
the
parole
board
sent
thomas
out.
it's
the
same.
i
see
the
same--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
but
should
they
have,
with
knowledge
of
the
facts?
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
excuse
me,
your
honor,
did
you
have
any--?
we
would
ask
that
we
would
return
to
the
san
diego
superior
court
to
try
and
litigate
our
case.
we
realize
we
have
a
difficult
burden
of
proof;
indeed,
we
could
lose
this
case.
but
we
would
like
to
go
back
with
a
good
faith
qualified
immunity
applicable
to
these
parole
officials.
we
would
ask
that
the
gross
negligence
standard
set
down
in
grimm
be
at
least
the
standard
applicable
to
the
instant
case.
we
would
state
that
economou
v.
procunier
was
a
case
of
negligence,
and
that
still
is
the
law
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
therein,
a
prisoner's
mail
was
opening
in
violation
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
and
it
was
negligently
opened.
herein,
we
have
the
taking
of
a
life.
accordingly,
a
good
faith
gross
negligence
standard
would
no
be
unreasonable,
nor
would
a
negligence
standard.
following
the
principles,
your
honors,
that
no
man
is
above
the
law,
set
down
by
this
court,
it
would
place
these
equal--these
people
in
an
equal
position
with
every
other
citizen,
that
of
being
held
accountable
for
their
actions
and
for
the
natural
consequences
of
their
actions,
as
stated
by
justice
douglass
in
monroe
v.
pope.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
i
think
what
the
court
says
is
that
the
judges
are
the
law.
and
that's
easier
for
me
to
say.
because
judges
aren't
above
the
law.
they
are
the
law.
nobody
is
above
the
law,
according
to
u.s.
v.
lee.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
but
they
don't
have--the
parole
officers
don't
have
the
inherence
conflicts
that
do
judges.
i
mean,
you're
going
to
have
to
get
an
attorney
from
the
da's
office
to
help
you,
and
there
he
is
prosecuting;
you've
got
a
terrible
conflict
built
in.
and
somebody
must
be
the
law.
judges
and
prosecutors
are
the
law.
parole
officers
aren't
officers
of
the
court;
they
don't
have
public
hearings.
finally,
and
most
importantly,
the
victim
is
the
only
class
of
person
not
asking
for
and
receiving
due
process
to
date
by
this
court.
by
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
martinez
family,
the
victim
would
finally
be
accorded
due
process
due
him.
indeed,
this
court
has
extended
the
protection
of
the
constitution,
to
every
minority,
to
every
class,
and
to
every
known
entity
except
the
victim.
that's
not
because
the
courts
turn
down
the
victim,
it's
because
this
is
the
first
time
the
victim
has
really
been
here.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
if
this
country
is
to
maintain
the
tradition
that
no
man
is
above
the
law,
and
that
government
is
indeed
the
servant
and
not
the
master
of
the
people,
then
it
is
desirable
to
do
away
with
the
ancient
notion
that
the
king
can
do
no
wrong,
but
his
servants
can
do
it
for
him.
we
think
that
the
drafters
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
of
the
constitution
would
have
it
no
other
way.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
briefly,
your
honor.
i
think
the
end
result
of
what
the
state's
attorney
is
saying
is
that
already
the
public
must
assume
the
risk
of
first
offenders.
that
we
can't
do
anything
about.
we
must
assume--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
procedural
due
process
would
have--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
no,
sir,
i
would
not.
and
there
would
have
been
at
least
the
airing
of
his
mental
capacity
in
an
open
courtroom
with
a
fair
and
honest
decision.
but
as
it
now
stands,
we
assume
the
risk
of
first
offenders;
we
can't
do
anything
about
that.
we
assume
the
risk
of
people
who
have
allegedly
been
rehabilitated.
now,
says
mr.
miller--state's
position--that
we
must
also
assume
the
risk
of
sexual
psychopaths
who
we
know
have
not
been
cured.
and
i
don't
think
that's--that
we
have
to
go
that
far.
we
don't
need
to
assume,
or
we
shouldn't
be
made
to
assume,
as
members
of
the
public,
the
risk
of
known
crazy
individuals
being
released
into
society.
i
am
not--
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
but
1871,
we
had
section
1983,
and
damages
tend
to
discourage
this
type
of
behavior,
so
says
the
court.
mr.
donald
mcgrath,
ii
well,
i'm
sure
they
could,
but
they
haven't.
and
we
have
a
federal
right
that's
being
violated
--
you
know,
by
maniacs;
and
that's
what
thomas
was.
i
don't
want
a
holding--and
the
martinez
family
has
not
asked
me
to
come
here--they
are
people
who
believe
in
a
second
chance.
a
parolee
who
has
said--and
looks
good
and
gets
out
and
commits
another
crime,
he's
not
the
entity
that
we
seek.
he's
not
the
person
we're
after.
he's
tried;
he's
done
a
good
job;
so
he
commits
a
crime.
no
liability.
this
man
was
declared
crazy.
and
he's
still
crazy.
and
they
let
him
go.
and
he
kills
this
little
girl.
not
fair.
thank
you,
your
honors.
