aren't
we
talking--doesn't
my
brother
rehnquist
suggest--his
present
question
suggest,
at
least,
that
we're
talking
about
two
different
things,
or
both--two
separate
things,
and
intermingling
them?
one
is,
have
you
stated
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1983?
and
would
you
have
stated
a
cause
of
action
against
the
judge
in
my
brother
rehnquist's
hypothetical?
and
the
second
is,
even
if
there
is
a
cause
of
action,
is
this
particular
defendant
immune?
now
those
are
two
quite
separate
questions.
and
don't--let's
not
mix
them
up.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
think
it'll
be
less
difficult
if
we
keep
the
two
questions
separate.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
scheuer
v.
rhodes
involved
only
the
immunity
of
the
defendant,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
first
of
all,
let's--if
there
was
no
question
of
this
defendant
being
immune
from
suit,
the
question
would
still
remain
-
have
you
stated
a
cause
of
action
under
1983?
justice
potter
stewart
and
conversely,
if
there
were
no
question
but
what
you
had
stated
a
cause
of
action
under
1983,
the
question
still
remains
-
is
this
particular
defendant
immune
from
suit,
or
immune
from
liability
under
1983?
those
are
two
quite
separate
questions.
and
as
you
say,
it's
a
difficult
enough
case
without
mixing
those
two
questions
up.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
question
which
your
brother
greatly
argues.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
rhodes
case,
scheuer
v.
rhodes,
did
ohio
law
purport
to
grant
absolute
immunity
to
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
as
clear-cut
as
california
law
is
in
this
case
then,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
there
reliance
on
state
law,
as
there
is
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
it's
a
matter
of
the
merits
again,
not
of
immunity,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
cases
in
which--in
this
court
on
which
you
rely
involve,
as
the
previous
questions
of
my
brother
rehnquist
imply,
a
situation
where--which
would
be
analogous
here--if
a
member
of
the
parole
board
had
raped
and
murdered
little
miss
mary
ellen
martinez;
you
see
what
i
mean?
there's
another
step
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
the
national
guard
in
scheuer
v.
rhodes
were
the
ones
who
actually
did
the
shooting
and
injury
to
the
plaintiff,
injuries
and
deaths
of
the
plaintiffs.
justice
potter
stewart
here--here
it
was
a
third
person.
and
the
analogy
here
would
be
if
a
member
of
the
parole
board
had
raped
and
murdered
miss
martinez.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed,
general
miller,
may
i
simply
ask,
was
the
grimm
case
a
1983
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
was
just
a
matter
of
the
state
tort
laws
saying
we're
not
going
to
give
absolute
immunity
to
this
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
state
court
action.
that's
nothing
involving
federal
law,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
your
feeling
that
it
was
necessary
to
mention
it.
but
am
i
correct
in
saying
that
it
didn't
involve
anything
except
state
tort
law?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
total
immunity
of
the
parole
board
with
respect
to
their
decision
to
release
somebody.
there's
not
total
immunity
of
the
parole
board
if
a
member
of
the--if
the
parole
board
itself
directly
injured
the
person;
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
