mr.
paul
c.
matthews
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
decision
below
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
places
the
maritime
law
in
line
with
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
jurisdictions
in
the
united
states.
it
places
it
in
line
with
the
restatement
of
torts
which
allows
this
remedy
of
loss
of
society
to
either
spouse
for
a
serious
injury
to
the
other.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
mr.
chief
justice,
before
coming
down
here
i
had
given
absolutely
no
thought
to
such
a
question.
i
had
assumed,
as
mr.
carr
had,
with
the
granting
of
certiorari
that
there
was
no
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
i
would
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
can
only,
your
honor,
suggest
something.
i
don't
know
if
it
is
in
keeping
with
the
rules
of
this
court,
but
there
is
a
procedure
among
the
state
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
when
this
case
came
up,
upon
the
determination
of
this
court,
that
then
we
would
clearly
have
a
final
determination
and
one
which
there
would
be
no
danger
of
becoming
moot
or
coming
back
to
this
court
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
waive
any
right
to
appeal
as
far
as
the
decision,
as
far
as
the
judgment
for
juanita
alvez
is
concerned
below.
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
problem,
that
that
would
solve
it.
unfortunately,
i
have
done
no
research
on
that
point.
i
know
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
if
they
did
not?
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
well,
i
suppose
that
there
is
always
the
possibly
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
might
find
some
grounds
for
error
in
the
record.
that
sort
of
thing
may
always
happen.
i
can't
state
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
well,
as
your
honor
could
understand,
as
we
counsel
stand
here
before
you
arguing
the
causes
of
our
clients,
we
think
first
in
terms
of
those
rights,
as
i
think
properly
we
should
as
attorneys,
and
perhaps
we
give
less
consideration
to
what
the
court
may
feel
is
important
as
far
as
the
possibility
of
the
issue
not
being
a
final
one.
i
know
i
could
speak
for
myself
and
i
assume
for
mr.
carr,
that
we
would
both
be
bitterly
disappointed
if
the
court
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
this
case
not
only
as
far
as
what
is
an
important
question
with
regard
to
the
rights
of
the
wife
of
an
injured
harbor
worker,
but
also
which
may
involve
a
serious
question
as
to
exactly
what
power
the
highest
court
of
the
state
has
in
interpreting
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
maritime
law.
if
it
is
appropriate
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
yes,
sir?
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
well,
if
i
could
state
this,
your
honor,
i
don't
see
how
the
issue
would
have
been
any
different
if
we
had
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
well,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that,
i
would
have
been
here,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
of
course
it
is.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
oh,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
i
certainly
couldn't
see
where
we
would
be
any
better
off
if
we
had
not
had
a
trial.
that
i
could
not
follow
the
logic
of.
i
would
follow
the
logic
of
waiting
if
it
is
the
will
of
this
court
to
do
so
until
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
appeal
through
the
state
courts
has
been
exhausted.
if
that
is
the
determination
of
this
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
your
honor,
juanita
alvez
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
no,
sir.
juanita
alvez
had
to
appeal
from
the
determination
made
against
her
by
special
term
which
denied
her
the
right
to
become
a
plaintiff
in
this
case.
if
she
did
not
take
that
appeal
and
perfect
it
within
one
year,
her
appeal
would
be
dismissed
and
from
there
on
the
matter
followed
through
the
appellate
processes
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
appellate
division
reversed
and
found
that
there
was
a
right
to
plead
this
cause
of
action
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
a
right
to
assert
it
and,
of
course,
this
court
granted
certiorari.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
in
fairness,
mr.
justice
white,
of
course
i
would
not
be
because
i
have
the
rights
of
the
client
to
protect.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
the
co-respondent
so-named
was
actually
the
employer
third-party
defendant
and
the
corespondent
i
think
should
properly
have
been
the
petitioner
or
co-petitioner
here,
because
as
far
as
this
issue
was
concerned
their
rights
were
clearly
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
did
not,
sir,
no.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i'm
sorry,
sir,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i'm
sorry
if
i
have
caused
any
confusion
with
respect
to
my
answer
to
a
previous
question.
i
meant
to
say,
if
i
did
misspeak,
that
i
didn't
think
that
it
would
have
made
any
difference
whether
the
trial
had
been
held
or
whether
it
had
not
been
held
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
--
before
the
determination
of
this
hearing.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
yes,
sir,
i
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
regret
to
say,
your
honor,
that
i
didn't
come
here
prepared
to
argue
that
point,
so
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
the
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
would
say
that
it
is
--
if
we
have
not
been
foreclosed
by
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
--
and
that
certainly
is
a
final
action
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
would
certainly
think
so,
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
we
would
have
been
obliged
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
advise
the
court
that
the
case
had
been
settled
and
that
the
controversy
had
become
moot.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
feel
that
that
is
a
good
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
regardless
of
whether
the
controversy
had
become
moot,
it
would
remain
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
counsel
would
have
the
argument
that
he
advanced
in
coming
before
this
court,
that
this
court
should
consider
the
issue
to
settle
for
once
and
for
all
what
the
rights
are
under
the
maritime
law.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
then
certainly
you
have
a
final
determination
which
is
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
do
you
not,
sir?
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
oh,
is
it
before
you
here
today?
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
if
it
is
not
on
this
record.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
well,
i
certainly
felt
that
if
the
defendant
consented
to
the
entry
of
judgment
or
waived
its
right
to
appeal,
that
surely
that
matter
would
be
here
before
you.
but
as
again
i
say
to
you,
i
didn't
come
here
prepared
to
argue
theory,
procedural
theory
on
this
and
i
could
be
way
off.
may
i
be
heard
on
the
merits
or
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
thank
you.
i
feel
that
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
a
progressive
and
liberal
determination
of
the
rights
of
an
injured
party
which
prevails
throughout
the
land
were
not
to
be
granted
by
the
maritime
law
where
this
court
certainly
in
moragne,
a
unanimous
decision,
declared
it
to
be
the
humanitarian
policy
to
grant
a
remedy
rather
than
to
withhold
it,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
extremely
ironic
if
such
a
remedy
should
stop
at
the
water's
edge.
i
think
that
there
is
no
reason
to
go
on
now
to
the
gaudet
decision
in
logic
or
justice
to
deny
the
right
to
a
wife
to
recover
these
damages
while
allowing
it
to
a
widow.
the
analogy
i
think
is
compelling.
this
court
said
in
moragne
that
in
most
respects
the
laws
applied
in
personal
injury
cases
will
govern
questions
that
arise
in
death
cases.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
well,
i
think
i
will
skip
ahead
then,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
heartily
disagree
with
mr.
carr
that
the
rights
of
the
blue-water
seamen
will
be
substantially
different
than
those
of
longshoremen
or
harbor
workers.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
well,
it
certainly
has
been
affirmatively
determined
by
this
court
in
higginbotham
that
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
no
such
right
exists.
and
it
is
clear
enough
that
this
court
65
years
ago
in
michigan
v.
vreeland
determined
that
no
such
right
existed
under
the
fela.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
yes,
sir.
this
court
found
no
difficulty
in
overruling
the
harrisburg
case
when
that
ancient
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
it
did
not
involve
a
statute,
but
michigan
v.
vreeland
involved
interpretation
of
a
statute.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
but
interpretation,
your
honor,
not
in
any
words
where
the
statute
had
restricted
the
amounts
that
could
be
recovered.
but
if
i
could,
i
think
i
am
now
in
my
discussion
on
that,
to
the
statutory
jones
act
aspects
of
things
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
yes,
sir,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
confine
myself
to
that
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
moragne,
the
unseaworthiness
remedy
has
now
become
the
primary
vehicle
for
the
blue-water
seamen
in
recovering
for
his
damages.
in
other
words,
the
burden
of
proof
of
unseaworthiness
is
so
much
less
than
that
of
proving
negligence
that
it
is
the
rare
case
where
there
will
be
recovery
under
negligence
and
not
under
unseaworthiness.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
it
is
an
anomaly
that
could
be
corrected
with
all
due
respect
by
this
court
by
simply
overruling
michigan
v.
vreeland.
i
think
that
the
interpretation
of
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
unlike
moragne,
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
in
construing
the
jones
act
in
times
past,
this
court
has
found
no
difficulty
in
going
beyond
the
bare
bones
of
the
words
of
the
statute.
in
maryland
casualty
v.
cushing,
this
court
held
that
the
jones
act
was
broad
enough
to
embrace
an
action
not
against
the
employer
but
against
the
insurance
company.
and
in
kernan
v.
american
dredging,
this
court
felt
that
although
the
fela
mentioned
negligence,
that
that
was
broad
enough
to
include
a
non-negligent
violation
of
a
statute.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
would
have
to
concede
that
point,
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
indicate
that
in
two
cases
cited
in
the
brief,
it
is
clearly
pointed
out,
one
of
them
being
the
pesos
case,
that
since
we
can
perceive
no
logical,
sound
or
reasonable
basis
to
differentiate
between
the
case
where
the
husband
was
killed
as
contrasted
to
injured
in
respect
to
the
wife's
entitlement
to
recover
for
loss
of
consortium,
we
conclude
that
ignerie
has
been
overruled
by
sealand
services
as
construed
by
skidmore.
and
also
in
the
lemon
case,
also
cited
i
believe
in
both
briefs,
the
opinion
of
the
chief
judge
for
the
southern
district
of
georgia,
"i
am
unable
to
see
the
rationality
of
a
rule
that
if
a
defendant's
negligence
causes
death,
consortium
can
be
recovered
by
the
widow,
but
where
it
only
results
in
injury
a
wife
cannot."
i
take
great
issue
with
my
brother,
mr.
carr,
with
regard
to
the
situation
as
far
as
the
ignerie
decision
is
concerned.
the
decision
by
judge
friendly
in
the
ignerie
case
was
by
no
means
a
dogmatic
decision.
it
was
an
invitational
decision,
because
in
the
decision
it
mentioned
the
common
law
by
saying
at
least
this
much
is
true,
if
the
common
law
recognized
as
wife's
claim
for
loss
of
consortium,
uniformly
or
nearly
so,
a
united
states
admiralty
court
would
approach
the
problem
here
by
asking
itself
why
it
should
not
likewise
do
so.
if
the
common
law
denied
such
a
claim,
uniformly
or
nearly
so,
the
inquiry
would
be
whether
there
was
sufficient
reason
for
an
admiralty
court's
nevertheless
recognizing
one.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
morning
i
had
already
discussed
the
compelling
analogy
between
the
right
of
the
widow
to
recover
for
loss
of
society
and
that
of
a
wife
of
a
badly
crippled
worker.
i
would
like
to
spend
the
remainder
of
my
time
discussing
the
decision
of
judge
friendly
in
the
ignerie
case,
discussing
the
christofferson
case,
and
discussing
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner
with
regard
to
the
uniformity.
with
regard
to
ignerie,
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
judge
friendly
was
not
in
any
way
dogmatic,
did
not
intend
to
be
engraved
in
stone,
but
rather
was
invitational
and
that
it
left
open
a
door
through
which
the
alvez
court,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
new
york
stepped
through
in
the
decision
below.
judge
friendly
wrote
in
ignerie,
"if
there
were
evidence
that
maritime
law
generally
recognized
a
claim
for
negligent
injury
to
such
an
intangible
right,
or
if
the
common
law
clearly
authorized
a
wife's
recovery,
the
gravitational
pull
of
such
concepts
with
respect
to
the
wife
of
a
longshoreman
might
be
stronger
than
that
of
the
analogy
to
the
statute
denying
such
a
recovery
to
a
seaman's
wife."
at
the
time,
in
1963,
when
judge
friendly
wrote
those
words,
19
jurisdictions
had
denied
the
remedy.
of
those
19,
today
15
have
reversed
the
law
so
that
we
have
at
the
present
time
only
four
jurisdictions
of
those
19,
plus
one
additional,
that
being
louisiana
where
the
right
has
been
denied.
in
addition,
judge
friendly
indicated
that
the
rights
were
too
personal,
too
intangible
and
too
conjectural
to
be
determined
by
a
jury,
but
that
contention
was
answered
by
this
court
in
gaudet
which
indicated
that
the
same
argument
could
be
made
with
regard
to
any
damages
for
pain
and
suffering
and
which
indeed
indicated
that
for
many,
many
years,
indeed
centuries,
that
courts
and
juries
had
been
called
upon
to
pass
upon
the
right
for
loss
of
consortium.
with
regard
to
a
contention
i
think
that
was
made
or
a
mention
in
judge
friendly's
opinion,
that
the
damages
were
parasitic
in
nature,
this
i
think
was
well
answered
by
the
court
below,
by
judge
jasen
who
said,
referring
to
a
wife,
in
the
good
times
she
lights
the
hearth
with
her
own
inimitable
glow,
but
when
tragedy
strikes
it
is
part
of
her
unique
glory
that
forsaking
the
shelter,
the
comfort,
the
warmth
of
the
home,
she
puts
her
arm
and
shoulder
to
the
plow.
we
are
now
at
the
heart
of
the
issue.
in
such
circumstances
when
her
husband's
love
is
denied
her,
his
strength
sapped
and
his
protection
destroyed,
in
short,
when
she
has
been
forced
by
the
defendant
to
exchange
a
heart
for
a
husk,
we
are
urged
to
rule
that
she
has
suffered
no
loss
compensable
at
the
law.
but
let
some
scoundrel
dent
a
dishpan
in
the
family
kitchen
and
the
law
in
all
its
majesty
will
convene
the
court,
will
march
with
measured
tread
to
the
halls
of
justice
and
will
there
suffer
a
jury
of
her
peers
to
assess
the
damages.
why
are
we
asked
then
in
this
case
to
look
the
other
way?
is
this
what
is
meant
when
it
is
said
that
justice
is
blind?"
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
your
honor
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
i
think,
your
honor,
that
congress
has
quite
clearly
delegated
this
area
to
this
court,
and
i
think
that
in
the
fitzgerald
case
this
court
recognized
its
duty
and
its
responsibility
in
that
area.
so
i
don't
think
it
is
something
that
in
any
means
is
within
the
province
of
congress.
i
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
of
course
they
could
do
so,
but
the
fact
that
they
have
not
done
so
one
way
or
the
other
is
nothing
that
should
be
influential
on
this
court.
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
opinion
in
moragne,
congress
has
specifically
left
to
this
court
the
duty
in
the
maritime
law
of
declaring
what
the
rights
of
injured
persons
should
be.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
the
power
of
course.
i
would
be
the
last
to
deny
that,
sir.
this
court
indicated
in
moragne
that
certainly
it
better
becomes
the
humane
and
liberal
character
of
proceedings
in
admiralty
to
give
then
to
withhold
the
remedy
when
not
required
to
do
so
by
established
and
inflexible
rules.
the
basis
for
the
statement
that
a
blue-water
seaman
does
not
have
or
the
wife
of
a
blue-water
seaman
does
not
have
this
right
is
in
the
christofferson
case,
where
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
considered
the
right
of
the
wife
on
three
grounds.
first,
they
considered
the
jones
act,
which
they
found
did
not
allow
this
remedy,
based
upon
judge
friendly's
decision
in
ignerie.
secondly,
they
found
that
with
respect
to
the
claim
for
unseaworthiness,
there
was
no
right
because
of
the
decision
of
judge
friendly
in
ignerie.
and
thirdly,
they
found
that
there
was
no
right
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
louisiana
where
the
injury
had
occurred
by
examining
the
state
law.
this
i
think,
without
trying
to
read
their
minds,
had
to
do
probably
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
just
v.
chambers
which
indicated
that
the
law
of
the
states
may
be
used
to
fill
in
voids
in
the
maritime
law.
so
we
have
a
situation
where,
according
to
the
christofferson
case,
is
some
44
of
the
jurisdictions
of
this
country,
such
a
remedy
would
be
allowed.
in
the
name
of
uniformity,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
have
you
to
turn
back
the
clock
on
almost
half
a
century
of
progressive
decisions,
affirming
the
concern
of
admiralty
for
the
welfare
of
those
injured
within
its
jurisdiction.
i
would
just
point
out
further
that
aligning
the
maritime
law
with
the
overwhelming
majority
of
states
will
eliminate
confusion
where
a
single
injury
may
result
from
violation
of
duties
owed
under
state
law
by
one
defendant
and
maritime
law
by
another,
and
it
would
be
a
situation
similar
to
that
which
is
involved
in
the
consolidated
machines
case
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
its
brief.
now,
if
i
have
any
time
left,
i
would
mention
what
i
concede
to
be
the
role
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
very
well.
i
simply
would
like
to
say
on
this
issue
which
was
designated
by
the
co-respondent
now
as
a
reverse
erie
issue,
that
the
--
and
which,
of
course,
could
not
affect
the
substantive
decision
of
this
case
--
that
unless
the
state
courts
are
permitted
to
examine
the
same
data
that
a
state
court
--
i'm
sorry,
unless
the
state
courts
are
permitted
to
examine
--
mr.
paul
c.
matthews
--
to
examine
the
same
data
that
a
federal
court
could
examine
in
reaching
the
determination,
that
in
fact
they
would
be
issuing,
they
would
be
giving
second-rate
justice.
and
if
it
was
known
that
the
state
courts
were
bound
blindly
to
stare
decisis
whereas
the
federal
courts
were
free
to
use
their
reasoning
in
interpretation
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
that
would
lead
to
forum
shopping.
thank
you.
