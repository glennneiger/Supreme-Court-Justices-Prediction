chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
79-1,
american
export
lines
v.
alvez.
mr.
carr,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
verdict
consistent
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
decided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
jury
was
instructed
under
the
majority
opinion
of
that
case,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
is
left
for
us
to
decide
at
this
stage
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hers
is
dependent
upon
his,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
any
opinion
we
give
--
doesn't
it
have
some
resemblance
to
an
advisory
opinion
on
the
pure
question
of
law
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
decided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
final
judgment,
you
mean
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
that
before
us
except
that
we
have
heard
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am,
frankly,
as
others
seem
to
be,
puzzled
about
what
it
is
we
being
asked
to
do.
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
announced
the
correct
standard
as
a
matter
of
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
therefore
that
would
tend
to
give
support
to
the
judgments
you
have
now
in
the
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven't
much
time
left
for
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
carr.
mr.
matthews.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
whether
we
should
decide
this
case
now
or
wait
to
see
what
happens
as
it
goes
up
the
hierarchy
of
courts
in
the
state
of
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
wasn't
suggesting
jurisdiction,
i
was
--
suppose,
for
example,
as
someone
suggested
by
a
question,
that
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
this
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
for
some
reason
goes
along
with
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
stipulate
to
judgment
absolute,
you
mean
waive
any
right
to
review?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
would
this
situation
be
if
after
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
had
come
down,
while
your
petition
for
cert
was
pending
here,
the
case
had
been
settled,
then
we
wouldn't
have
granted
the
petition
for
cert.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
far
as
events
within
the
state
of
new
york
were
concerned,
everyone
would
be
bound
by
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
whether
it
was
right
or
whether
it
is
not
right,
in
a
federal
sense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
no
appeal
is
taken
now
from
the
judgments
that
were
described
to
us
for
$550,000?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
judgment
before
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
there
be
anything
for
us
to
decide
if
no
appeal
is
taken?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
yes,
by
all
means.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
is
an
anomaly
resulting
because
of
higginbotham,
isn't
that
an
anomaly
that
could
be
corrected
by
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
and
you
have
about
nine
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
until
the
red
light
goes
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead
and
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
carr?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
would
have
to
produce
some
evidence
to
support
that,
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
was
a
very
mild
injury,
there
wouldn't
be
much
prospect,
would
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
as
to
amount,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
conceivably
a
reviewing
court
might
reduce
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
might
even
say
that
it
is
a
frivolous
argument
in
light
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
