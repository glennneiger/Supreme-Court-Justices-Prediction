mr.
carr,
to
what
extent
do
you
think
judge
friendly
relied
on
in
an
analogy
to
the
common
law
in
his
interpretation
of
the
maritime
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
agree
that
the
majority
view
in
the
common
law
is
now
somewhat
different
that
it
was
in
1963?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
whether
judge
friendly
would
have
done
it
or
not,
should
this
court
be
guided
by
the
common
law
in
fashioning
a
somewhat
similar
body
of
law
in
the
maritime
area,
since
we
don't
have
any
statutory
guidance
from
congress.
