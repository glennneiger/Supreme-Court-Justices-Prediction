justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
you
opposed
the
grant
of
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
have
been
so
bitterly
disappointed
if
we
denied
cert,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so
i
take
it
that
your
co-respondent
suggested
that
we
should
grant.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
that
in
acting
as
a
respondent
anyway,
it
was
probably
named
that
way
because
of
our
rules.
anyway,
he
did
assert
that
the
judgment
was
final
within
cox
broadcasting,
but
in
opposing
cert
you
didn't
raise
any
jurisdictional
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
if
the
new
york
court
system
has
finally
disposed
of
this
federal
issue
of
the
right
of
the
wife?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
lost
at
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
judgment
has
gone
against
you,
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
the
consortium
issue
the
judgment
has
gone
against
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
issue
has
not
--
if
you
want
to
appeal
in
the
state
court
system,
the
right
of
the
wife
is
not
subject
to
relitigation,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
you
appeal
the
judgment
to
the
appellate
division
and
one
of
the
grounds
for
appeal
is
the
wife
has
no
right
in
the
first
place
under
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would
the
appellate
division
say?
what
would
the
appellate
division
say
if
you
did?
what
would
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
then
what
you
are
really
arguing
jurisdiction
is
that
the
only
time
you
could
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
that
is
before
us
now
is
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
otherwise
you
would
be
untimely.
