mr.
stephen
k.
carr
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
today
is
a
simple
one.
it
is
whether
the
wife
of
a
harbor
worker,
a
so-called
substitute
or
sieracki
seaman
is
entitled
to
seek
non-pecuniary
or
sometimes
called
sentimental
damages
for
loss
of
society
or
consortium
occasioned
by
her
husband's
injury,
when
the
traditional
admiralty
view
as
expressed
by
congress
in
all
the
applicable
maritime
statutes
precludes
such
a
right,
and
especially
when
the
wife
of
a
blue-water
seaman
is
denied
such
a
right
under
the
jones
act.
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
which
in
a
five-to-one
decision
granted
juanita
alvez
the
right
to
sue
for
her
husband's
loss
of
consortium
occasioned
by
his
injury.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
believe
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
at
that
time
that
was
the
case,
sir.
i
might
update
the
court
on
subsequent
facts,
however.
since
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
this
case
proceeded
to
trial
just
two
weeks
ago,
and
at
that
trial
juanita
alvez
was
permitted
to
join
her
husband
as
a
co-plaintiff.
during
the
trial,
there
was
testimony
from
the
plaintiff
himself
that
he
had
been
a
blue-water
seaman
for
26
years
and
had
spent
the
last
14
of
those
years
as
a
boatswain
in
the
highest
unlicensed
rating
in
the
deck
department.
mr.
alvez
testified
that
because
of
union
regulations
he
had
to
take
his
vacation
in
1972,
the
year
of
this
accident,
and
that
during
that
vacation
time
decided
to
moonlight
as
a
lasher,
not
as
a
seaman.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir.
but
that
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decided
the
issue
as
far
as
mrs.
alvez
is
concerned
concerning
her
right
to
sue
for
loss
of
consortium.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
court
during
the
trial
submitted
separate
interrogatories
to
the
jury
so
that
in
the
event
this
court
decided
she
was
not
entitled
to
sue
for
loss
of
consortium,
the
award
that
the
jury
gave
her
could
be
remanded
at
a
later
date.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
that
case
can
eventually
come
up
here,
your
honor,
on
other
grounds
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well,
as
far
as
the
loss
of
consortium
claim
is
concerned,
i
submit
it
is
a
final
decision
and
one
which
this
court
must
face
at
this
stage.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
it
did,
sir.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
the
only
federal
question
before
it.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
pardon
me?
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
who
couldn't
wait,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
the
trial
court
took
that
into
consideration
and
felt
that
the
record
would
be
reserved
by
the
expedient
it
chose
of
submitting
juanita
alvez's
claim
to
the
jury
separately.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
so
that
her
claim
would
be
intact
upon
its
presentation
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir.
at
the
trial
two
weeks
ago,
alvez
himself
received
a
verdict
from
the
jury
on
the
sole
issue
that
was
given
to
the
jury
of
unseaworthiness
in
the
sum
of
$1
million.
that
verdict
was
reduced
by
50
percent
for
his
contributory
negligence.
the
separate
issue
of
juanita
alvez's
loss
of
consortium
was
also
submitted
to
the
jury
after
the
testimony
concerning
loss
of
society
and
other
effects
that
her
husband's
injury
had
had
on
her
marriage.
the
jury
awarded
juanita
alvez
$100,000
for
loss
of
consortium,
the
non-pecuniary
aspect
of
her
damages,
and
reduced
that
by
50
percent
also
by
virtue
of
her
husband's
contributory
negligence.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
the
jury
effected
this
reduction
under
the
instruction
of
the
court
in
specific
special
interrogatories.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
judgement
has
been
entered
on
those
verdicts.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
i
think
that
the
verdict
has
to
in
some
way
color
the
court's
thinking.
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
she
did
have
a
right
to
seek
non-pecuniary
damages.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
indeed
it
was,
sir.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
what
is
left
for
this
court
to
decide
is
whether
in
fact
she
had
the
right
in
the
first
place
to
seek
consortium
damages
of
a
non-pecuniary
sort.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well,
theoretically
if
appealed
from
that
judgment
ever
got
this
far,
that
might
be
the
case.
but
we
submit
that
this
is
a
tidier
way
of
handling
the
initial
question.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
no,
sir,
i
have
not.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well,
we
are
not
faced
with
that
question
here
today.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
i
understand,
sir.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
if
the
appellate
division
reverses,
it
would
not
reverse
on
the
question
of
juanita
alvez's
claim
for
consortium.
if
the
appellate
division
reverses,
it
would
probably
reverse
on
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
--
instructions
to
the
jury
that
may
have
been
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
it
changed
this
judgment
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals?
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
then
i
submit
that
her
verdict
becomes
a
nullity.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
hers
is
a
derivative
of
his.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
only
that
aspect
of
it
as
pertains
to
the
wife.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well,
we
gave
this
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
--
we
gave
this
considerable
thought
before
the
trial
and
it
was
the
judgment
of
those
people
involved
in
the
trial,
including
the
trial
judge,
that
this
particular
federal
question
could
be
reserved
by
approaching
it
in
this
particular
fashion.
i
had
supposed
that
we
were
proper
in
doing
that.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
your
honor,
if
we
had
settled
the
case
during
the
trial
stages
and
had
come
before
you
seeking
your
judgment
on
her
cause
of
action
for
consortium,
i
believe
it
would
have
been
an
advisory
opinion
and
we
should
not
have
attempted
to
do
that.
however,
with
a
final
judgment
i
do
not
believe
that
the
nature
of
this
court's
deliberations
or
determination
would
be
advisory.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
no,
i
mean
the
final
judgment
of
the
trial
court,
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
county.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well,
it
is
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
right,
but
if
in
fact,
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
misinterpreted
the
federal
law,
as
is
our
position,
then
the
verdict
she
received
would
be
a
nullity.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir,
that
sounds
analogous.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
i
can't,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
i
had
expected
we
has
passed
beyond
that
threshold
issue
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
discuss
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
any
question
concerning
the
claim
for
loss
of
consortium
by
the
wife
of
an
injured
harbor
worker
has
to
begin
and
i
submit
has
to
end
with
the
decision
of
judge
friendly
in
the
ignori
case
decided
in
1963.
judge
friendly
recognized
that
it
was
a
fresh
and
novel
question
when
he
addressed
it
at
that
time,
at
a
time
when
the
common
law
permitted
a
wife's
claim
for
loss
of
consortium
in
only
12
of
the
states
of
this
nation.
but
despite
that
fact,
judge
friendly
did
not
dismiss
her
claim
for
loss
of
consortium
but
felt
it
was
necessary
to
examine
the
decisional
maritime
law
on
the
issue.
the
decisional
maritime
law
produced
only
two
cases
where
this
particular
question
had
arisen,
and
in
both
of
those
cases
involving
a
claim
by
a
wife
of
loss
of
consortium,
the
claim
had
been
dismissed
by
the
district
court.
so
judge
friendly
drew
upon
analogous
maritime
statutes
to
arrive
at
his
decision,
and
the
statute
he
looked
at
first
and
foremost
was
the
jones
act
which
was
an
act
designed
initially
to
remove
an
anomaly
that
existed
in
the
maritime
law.
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
jones
act,
a
longshoreman
could
bring
suit
for
negligence
against
a
ship
owner,
whereas
a
seaman
could
not.
in
passing
the
jones
act,
congress
gave
the
right
to
the
seaman
to
sue
his
employer
for
negligence,
but
it
did
so
in
a
limited
fashion.
it
restricted
the
right
to
the
seaman
himself
by
the
very
language
of
the
act,
which
states
any
seaman
may
bring
this
cause
of
action.
as
a
result,
that
act
has
been
interpreted
and
constantly
followed
by
the
courts
as
granting
only
the
right
to
sue
for
negligence
to
the
seaman
himself
and
not
to
his
dependents
and
not
to
his
relatives
who
might
otherwise
be
entitled
to
do
so
were
they
governed
by
state
statute.
judge
friendly
also
was
careful
to
note
that
the
jones
act
incorporated
specifically
the
terms
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
which
also
restricts
recovery
to
the
person
injured,
and
this
court
so
decided
in
tonsellito
long
before
the
passage
of
the
jones
act.
so
judicial
construction
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
imposed
the
same
restrictions
on
the
jones
act
permitting
only
suit
against
the
ship
owner
by
the
seaman
himself
and
not
by
the
wife,
not
by
any
dependents
or
relatives
and
family.
using
the
jones
act
as
the
analogous
law
in
the
maritime
field,
judge
friendly
concluded
that
there
was
no
right
for
a
wife
to
sue
for
loss
of
consortium
in
a
maritime
cause
of
action,
and
that
scholarly
opinion
remained
the
settled
harmonious
law
in
the
maritime
field
until
this
court's
decision
in
1974
in
the
gaudet
case,
a
wrongful
death
action.
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
gaudet
case,
in
a
narrow
majority
opinion,
finding
a
right
for
loss
of
consortium
in
widow
should
have
that
particular
measure
of
damages
confined
to
the
narrow
limitations
that
higginbotham
later
placed
upon
gaudet,
that
is
a
wrongful
death
situation
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states.
after
the
gaudet
decision,
there
were
some
courts,
lower
courts,
district
and
state
courts
that
split
just
about
evenly
on
this
question
as
to
whether
gaudet
had
actually
had
any
effect
on
the
viability
of
the
igneri
rule.
the
only
federal
appellate
court
to
address
this
question
after
the
igneri
decision,
after
the
gaudet
decision
was
christofferson
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
found
that
igneri
was
alive
and
well.
we
believe
that
it
is
the
abiding
concern
of
this
court
to
administer
a
uniform
body
of
federal
law
in
the
maritime
field,
and
that
it
is
this
concern
that
prompted
the
court
to
decide
the
moragne
case
the
way
it
was
decided,
to
reaffirm
uniformity
in
an
area
that
was
a
patchwork
of
strange
and
anomalous
results
following
the
harrisburg
decision
which
denied
the
right
of
wrongful
death
recovery
under
the
general
maritime
law.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
no.
that
is
one
the
problems,
your
honor.
gaudet
kind
of
set
off
in
a
direction
that
was
without
precedent
in
the
maritime
filed
by
for
the
first
time
awarding
loss
of
consortium
in
a
wrongful
death
situation,
contrary
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
contrary
to
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
contrary
to
the
jones
act.
and
when
this
measure
of
damages
was
first
examined
by
this
court
subsequently
in
the
higginbotham
case,
gaudet's
holding
on
loss
of
consortium
for
pecuniary
and
non-pecuniary
damages
was
confirmed
to
the
territorial
waters
in
wrongful
death
actions.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
frankly,
i
believe
overruling
gaudet
would
restore
harmony
and
uniformity
to
this
area
of
law,
and
that
seems
to
be
one
of
the
ways
of
avoiding
the
anomaly
which
otherwise
exists.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
even
if
judge
friendly
were
to
address
the
igneri
issue
today
as
he
did
in
1963,
despite
changing
times
and
changing
patterns,
women's
rights,
he
would
decide
the
issue
exactly
the
same
way
today
as
he
decided
it
in
1963,
and
he
indicated
as
much
in
the
concluding
paragraph
of
his
opinion
when
he
said
had
the
sexes
of
the
parties
been
reversed,
that
is,
had
peter
igneri,
the
husband,
been
suing
for
loss
of
consortium
of
his
wife,
theresa,
had
she
been
injured
aboard
the
vessel,
he
would
have
denied
a
loss
of
consortium
claim
to
peter
igneri
even
though
common
law
recognized
such
a
right
in
a
husband.
so
that
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
there
is
no
discrimination
in
judge
friendly's
decision
with
respect
to
the
sexes,
that
he
decided
the
issue
before
him
in
an
even-handed
way,
and
that
it
was
his
intention
to
restore
parity
between
longshoremen
and
seamen
in
this
area
of
non-pecuniary
speculative
damages.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well,
because
it
was
a
fresh
and
a
novel
issue,
i
think
he
gave
scholarly
concern
to
the
common
law.
but
by
the
same
token,
since
he
felt
at
that
time
that
the
common
law
was
pretty
much
of
a
toss-up,
i
don't
believe
he
placed
that
much
reliance
on
the
majority
view
in
the
common
law.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
oh,
indeed
it
is,
sir,
but
i
don't
think
that
has
any
real
bearing
because,
as
i
said,
when
he
concluded
his
opinion,
he
said
were
the
roles
of
the
sexes
reversed
he
would
arrive
at
the
same
decision
by
his
analogy
to
the
jones
act.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well,
i
think
we
have
a
statutory
guidance
in
areas
of
the
maritime
law
that
are
analogous
and
those
areas
specifically
are
the
federal
employers
liability
act
and
the
jones
act
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
and
i
feel
that
those
congressional
expressions
of
policy
should
be
paramount
in
this
court's
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
such
a
cause
of
action
exists
under
the
general
maritime
law.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir,
just
a
few
words.
the
respondent
would
urge
that
no
distinction
be
made
between
the
measure
of
damages
in
the
fatal
and
non-fatal
injuries.
in
doing
so,
he
would
ask
the
court
to
make
a
distinction
between
longshoremen
and
the
wives
of
longshoremen
and
seamen
and
their
wives.
it
is
petitioner's
position
that
it
makes
eminently
better
sense
if
a
distinction
has
to
be
made
to
make
that
distinction
between
life
and
death
than
it
does
to
make
an
artificial
distinction
between
longshoremen
and
their
progeny
and
their
wives
and
seamen
and
their
wives.
the
longshoremen's
rights
are
a
derivative
from
seamen
and
to
elevate
the
status
of
a
longshoremen
and
his
wife
to
a
position
above
the
employee
from
whom
he
derives
his
rights
makes
no
sense
at
all.
if
respondent's
position
were
to
be
accepted,
it
would
mean
that
every
time
a
longshoremen
is
injured,
whether
it
be
a
bump,
a
scrape,
a
laceration,
a
bruise,
he
would
be
accompanied
in
his
lawsuit
by
a
spouse
seeking
sentimental
damages.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
that
--
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
mit
would
nevertheless
give
him
or
her
the
right
which
is
the
right
that
we
are
addressing
ourselves
to
today.
i
would
like
to
finish
by
saying
that
this
right
that
we
were
discussing
at
lunch
or
just
before
lunch
with
respect
to
our
standing
before
this
court,
is
a
right
--
if
there
is
any
reservation
among
the
members
of
this
court
about
our
standing
--
is
something
that
i
would
ask
your
permission
to
give
us
leave
to
brief
the
question
if
in
fact
you
feel
that
we
are
not
here
properly.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
the
new
york
state
court
system
has
finally
disposed
of
the
issue
of
the
right
of
the
wife.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
well,
i
don't
like
to
put
it
that
way.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
there
is
judgment
against
my
client.
i
also
have
an
indemnity
judgment
against
the
third-party
defendant.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
indeed
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
the
right
of
the
wife
is
final
as
far
as
the
new
york
state
court
system
is
concerned.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
except
as
to
amount.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
with
respect
to
excessiveness,
that
is
so.
but
as
far
as
the
wife's
right
of
consortium,
that
right
is
final
in
the
state
courts
and
cannot
be
relitigated
in
that
forum.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
i
can't
possibly
make
that
argument
at
this
stage.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
the
appellate
division
would
say
this
is
res
judicata,
this
has
decided
by
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
and
does
not
permit
you
to
pursue
the
matter
further.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
exactly.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
is
today.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
mr.
stephen
k.
carr
yes,
sir,
i
believe
i
would,
having
failed
to
appeal
from
the
appellate
division's
reversal
of
the
lower
court,
that
i
would
have
lost
my
right
on
the
consortium
grounds.
as
i
understand
the
procedure,
your
honor,
i
had
my
time
to
perfect
the
appeal
on
that
particular
issue
and,
having
failed
to
do
so,
i
would
have
waived
my
right.
