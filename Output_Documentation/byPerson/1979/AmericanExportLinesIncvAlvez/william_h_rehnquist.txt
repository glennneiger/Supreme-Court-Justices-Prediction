justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
is
a
final
decision
for
purposes
of
our
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
you
shouldn't
have
denied
the
motion
to
intervene.
no
damages
have
been
awarded.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
determination
of
negligence
has
been
awarded.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
all
testimony
that
was
brought
out
at
the
trial
two
weeks
ago?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
we
have
to
take
the
case
as
it
comes
to
us
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
rendered
its
decision
sometime
previously
to
two
weeks
ago?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
following
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
that
is
now
appealable
and
although
the
new
york
courts
will
hold
it
is
law
of
the
case,
it
would
remain
open
in
this
case
on
appeal
from
that
jury
verdict,
would
it
not,
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
be
tidier
but
a
lot
depends
on
what
congress
has
said
as
to
what
our
jurisdiction
is.
have
you
picked
out
which
of
the
four
exceptions
to
finality
that
this
comes
under
in
the
cox
broadcasting
company
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
not
either
your
fault
or
opposing
counsel's,
as
you
say
when
certiorari
is
granted
you
have
a
right
to
assume
that
there
is
jurisdiction.
but
if
you
will
recall
the
proceedings
this
morning,
the
chief
justice
announced
an
opinion
for
the
court
in
which
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
which
suggests
that
we
on
occasion
recognize
mistakes
of
our
own
in
the
exercise
of
our
certiorari
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
one
which
we
have
to
look
to
as
well
as
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
a
state
court,
before
you
have
a
final
judgment,
the
problem
isn't
just
that
the
case
may
go
away
but
that
congress
has
said
that
you
have
to
have
a
final
judgment
in
order
to
bring
the
case
from
the
highest
court
of
the
state
to
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
one
thing
to
construe
a
statute
broadly,
it
is
another
thing
to
overrule
a
previous
construction
of
the
same
statute,
is
it
not?
the
cases
you
mentioned
were
not
overruling
previous
statutory
construction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
congress
could
not
pass
a
law
saying
the
right
of
consortium
shall
not
be
a
compensable
element
in
an
action
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
not
quite
the
same
as
saying
it
is
not
within
the
province
of
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
you
had
not
appeared
at
the
time
you
did
and
simply
went
back,
tried
the
case,
gone
up
to
the
appellate
division,
recognized
it
was
law
of
the
case
of
new
york
or
stare
decisis
or
that
there
was
no
bar
to
consortium
rights,
argued
other
issues
in
the
court
of
appeals,
do
you
think
you
would
have
been
precluded
from
appealing
to
this
court
on
the
consortium
issue
at
that
stage?
