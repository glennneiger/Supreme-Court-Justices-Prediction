justice

marshall
mr.
carr,
can
that
case
come
up
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
we
decide
one
part
and
then
any
other
part?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
couldn't
wait?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
couldn't
wait
for
us
to
decide
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
the
petitioner
--
no,
the
trial
court,
or
the
petitioner,
or
anybody
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
have
got
a
judgment
here
that
depends
on
what
we
say
later
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
that
is
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
have
problems
with
the
same
case
being
in
two
courts
at
the
same
time.
i
mean
my
old
law
school
bringing
up,
i
am
in
trouble
with
that.
now,
should
we
let
this
verdict
that
she
has
color
our
thinking?
justice
thurgood
marshall
should
we
ignore
it
if
we
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
carr,
what
happens
if
the
appellate
division
reverses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
correct.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
the
appellate
division
leaves
that
intact,
the
$50,000,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
leave
it
intact.
and
then
we
changed
this
judgement
here,
what
happens
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
in
effect
reversed
the
new
trial
that
she
just
went
through.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
two
courts
going
on
side
by
side.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
no
way
to
run
a
railroad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
me
a
case
that
happened
where
it
went
back
and
then
it
came
back
up
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
sure
you
can't.
and
i
say
again,
i'm
not
blaming
this
on
you
because
we
granted
certiorari.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
our
opinion
would
be
advisory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
matthews
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
i
can
only
speak
for
myself,
but
when
i
participated
in
the
conference
on
granting
certiorari
in
this
case,
i
didn't
have
any
idea
that
you
were
going
to
try
the
case,
and
that
is
my
confusion,
that
you
went
through
with
the
trial.
that
is
my
confusion.
i
didn't
assume
you
were
going
to
go
through
with
a
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
have
happened
if
we
had
set
this
case
for
argument
on
the
same
day
as
the
trial,
which
one
would
you
have
gone
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
a
problem
when
you
have
a
case
in
two
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
i
really
have
a
problem.
you
couldn't
wait
for
this
court,
but
you
want
this
court
to
wait
for
your
court.
do
you
see
the
problem
when
you
have
two
courts?
do
you
see
the
problem
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
saying
you
can
solve
the
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
matthews,
do
you
know
any
way
we
can
get
congress
to
pass
on
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
the
more
you
go
on
with
it,
it
seems
like
something
congress
should
get
into.
