justice

stewart
it
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
certified
question,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
separate
and
the
only
federal
question
in
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
it
was
governed
exclusively
by
federal
law
and
that
it
was
the
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
only
federal
question
that
has
been
raised
in
this
case
and
as
such
separable
and
unique.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
telling
us
that
in
a
trial
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
on
that
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
the
jury
effected
this
reduction
in
both
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
comparative
contributory
negligence.
justice
potter
stewart
and
judgment
was
entered
on
those
verdicts?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
only
what
congress
has
said,
it
really
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
which
is
confined
only
to
questions
of
federal
law
and
--
it
so
happens
that
there
has
been
a
jury
award
for
the
plaintiff
and
a
judgement
entered
on
that
jury
verdict,
but
at
least
in
theory
this
could
have
been
remanded
as
it
was
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
there
could
have
been
a
trial
in
which
the
defendant
prevailed,
and
the
federal
question
would
never
have
been
presented
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact,
because
of
subsequent
events.
we
may
be
faced
with
it
today,
but
as
suggested
by
my
brother
rehnquist's
question,
and
i
must
say,
none
of
this
questioning
is
even
implicitly
critical
of
you.
it
is
the
court
that
granted
certiorari.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
whatever
result
is
reached
here
in
the
light
of
gaudet
and
higginbotham
is
going
to
be
an
anomaly.
it
is
either
going
to
stop
at
the
water's
edge
or
it
is
going
to
stop
at
the
blue
water's
edge,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
don't
you
answer
the
question
because
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
pretty
clear
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
as
well
as
the
jones
act
that
there
is
no
recovery
for
loss
of
consortium?
justice
potter
stewart
which
was
incorporated
in
the
jones
act.
justice
potter
stewart
that
did
not
involve
a
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
are
still
in
a
statutory
construction
case.
justice
potter
stewart
unlike
moragne.
