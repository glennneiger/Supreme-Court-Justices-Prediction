justice

paul

mr.
carr,
isn't
this
in
terms
of
our
jurisdiction
just
as
though
the
intervenor
had
been
a
plaintiff
who
filed
a
complaint
and
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
complaint
and
then
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
for
a
new
trial?
here
in
effect
they
reversed
and
said
let
the
intervenor
come
in
and
have
a
trial.
is
it
not
perfectly
clear
that
if
there
had
been
a
reversal
such
as
i
described,
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction?
this
court
has
many
times
taken
cases
where
an
original
trial
dismissal
has
been
reversed
on
appeal
and
sent
back
for
a
new
trial,
and
that
is
basically
what
happened
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
gaudet
and
higginbotham
together
don't
add
up
to
much
uniformity,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
we
should
overrule
gaudet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
matthews,
you
suggested
a
moment
or
two
ago
that
the
fact
that
a
trial
has
been
held
really
doesn't
have
any
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
the
order
we
are
now
reviewing
or
being
asked
to
review
was
final.
the
question,
the
jurisdictional
question
as
i
understand
it
is
when
an
appellate
court
remands
a
case
for
trial,
is
that
a
final
order
which
we
can
review.
i
think
we
have
done
it
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
times.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
had
been
postponed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
our
jurisdiction
to
review
the
order
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
remanding
the
case
to
the
trial
court
for
trial
is
unaffected
by
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
trial
is
held
before
or
after
we
actually
reach
argument.
that
is
your
point,
i
take
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
dead
right,
and
it
seems
to
me
we
have
many,
many
times
reviewed
appellate
court
orders
when
the
appellate
courts
have
sent
a
case
back
for
trial.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
discretion
it
is
often
unwise
for
us
to
do
so
because
the
case
may
go
away.
you
might
have
lost
this
lawsuit
and
then
the
case
would
have
become
moot.
but
i
am
puzzled
about
the
concern
about
the
finality
of
the
power
to
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
perhaps
you
can
help
me
on
this,
though.
suppose
the
case
had
gone
back
to
trial
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
for
state
purposes
anyway
finally
disposed
of
the
federal
question
and
it
said
that
there
should
be
a
trial
and
that
the
complaint
could
be
amended
and
the
widow
should
be
allowed
to
try
her
case,
is
that
issue
any
longer
open
in
the
state
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
widow
can
state
a
good
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
cannot
--
so
in
the
event
if
the
case
would
have
come
out
a
certain
way
in
the
lower
courts,
that
issue
is
definitely
foreclosed
from
any
kind
of
relitigation
in
the
state
courts?
