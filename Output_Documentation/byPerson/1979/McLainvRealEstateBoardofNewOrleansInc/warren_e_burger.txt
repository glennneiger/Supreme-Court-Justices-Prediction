chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-1501,
mclain
against
real
estate
board.
mr.
vinet,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
your
answer
is
that
the
district
court
on
the
facts
before
it
should
have
ruled
for
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
by
the
right
standard,
do
you
mean
the
standard
that--or
something
like
the
standard
that
was
applied
in
goldfarb?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
easterbrook.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
read
the
--
you
seem
to
read
the
fifth
circuit
holding
as
meaning
--
as
holding,
in
fact,
that
under
no
circumstances
can
the
real
estate
brokerage
business
ever
be
read
as
in
or
affecting
interstate
commerce.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
what
do
you
think
--
on
page
39a,
the
paragraph
that
was
read
to
you
before,
"with
our
endorsement
of
the
district
court's
determination
that
this
particular
real
estate
activity."
do
you
take--say
that
phrase,
"this
particular
real
estate
activity,"
means
all
real
estate
brokerage
business,
or
the
one
claimed
and
shown
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
new
orleans
real
estate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
the
contrary,
there's
--
you'll
find
statements
in
there
also
that
no
lawyer
felt
free
to
charge
anything
less
than
the
fixed
rate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
was,
that
of
all
the
36
lawyers
who
were
fooled,
as
it
were,
they
all
said
they
were
not
free.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mccall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
don't
read
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
as
your
friend
does,
namely,
that
the
brokerage
business,
real
estate
brokerage
business
could
never
be
shown
to
affect
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
quite
say,
on
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
page
39,
"this
particular
real
estate
activity."
there's
a
certain
ambiguity
in
the
word
"activity,"
perhaps.
that
is,
if
he
was
talking
about
the
activity
embraces
in
the
pleadings,
or
--
that's
one
thing;
if
it's
activity
in
the
whole
metropolitan
area
of
new
orleans,
that's
something
else.
but
you
read
it
narrowly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
sense,
is
it
your
position
that
this
is
roughly
parallel
to
a
complaint
and
a
showing
where
there
--
depending
on
diversity
of
citizenship,
there's
either
a
flawed
or
no
allegation
of
diversity,
and
nothing
to
supplement
that,
and
the
court
then
decides
that
this
is
not
a
diversity
case,
and
therefore,
no
jurisdiction?
is
that
the
kind
of
situation
we
have,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record,
mr.
mccall,
show
the
aggregate
amount
of
commissions
in
new
orleans-
in
a
given
year
on
all
real
estate
transactions
in
which
a
broker
was
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
run
into,
i
would
assume,
a
good
many
millions
of
dollars,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
it's
quite
different
from
washington,
d.c.,
because
the
aggregate
commissions
here
must
easily
match
the
figures
in
this
area.
but
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
assume
it's
$5
million
in
a
given
year.
then
the
next
step
would
be
the
response
that
you
gave
mr.
justice
white
does
this
have
an
affect
upon
the
price
of
houses?
and
i
think
you
conceded
that
probably
it
could
have
some
effect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
doesn't
have
to,
because
in
a
dollar
amount,
it
goes
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hasn't
the
rate
itself
gone
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
has
in
most
places
from
5
percent
to
6
percent
in
the
last
ten
years
or
less.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
coronado
coal
cases
were
criminal
cases,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
78-1501,
mclain
and
others
against
the
real
estate
board
of
new
orleans
incorporated
and
others.
for
reasons
stated
and
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
the
case.
