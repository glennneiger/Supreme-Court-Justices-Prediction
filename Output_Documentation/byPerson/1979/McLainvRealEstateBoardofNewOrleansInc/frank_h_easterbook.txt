mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
petitioners
in
this
case
were
trying
to
argue
that
real
estate,
which
it
termed
the
quintessentially
local
product,
is
part
of
interstate
commerce.
it
said
that
the
answer
was
no,
because
there
had
been
no
showing
that
the
activities
of
brokers
were
essential
to
loans
in
exactly
the
way
the
activities
of
lawyers
were
essential
to
loans
in
the
goldfarb
case.
without
that,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
there
could
be
no
finding
of
interstate
commerce.
petitioners
argue
here,
and
the
united
states
agrees,
that
that
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
internally
inconsistent
in
that
respect.
there
are
other
portions
of
the
opinion
that
appear
to
say
that
they're
asking
the
question
whether
real
estate
itself,
rather
than
the
brokerage
services,
is
part
of
interstate
commerce.
i
take
it
that
real
estate
is
not
part
of
interstate
commerce,
unless
you
have
a
river
meandering,
and
you
have
an
original
jurisdiction
case.
but
this
is
quite
a
different
matter
entirely.
the
argument
--
the
argument,
i
think,
is
a
rather
straightforward
argument,
one
of
practical
economics,
as
the
court
put
it
in
the
rex
hospital
case.
and
it
runs
almost
identical
to
the
argument
that
this
court
accepted
in
burke
v.
ford.
it
runs
something
like
this
brokers
sell
information
and
assistance
in
conducting
transactions.
their
services
aren't
tied
to
the
land,
but
rather,
are
tied
to
the
clients
and
to
the
clients'
money.
a
price-fixing
agreement,
setting
the
price
of
those
services,
increases
their
price.
when
the
price
of
a
commodity
is
increased,
less
of
that
commodity
is
purchased.
if
less
brokerage
service
is
purchased,
it
is
less
likely
that
buyers
and
sellers
will
get
together
on
a
real
estate
deal.
and
that's
particularly
important
for
interstate
movers,
who
often
rely
on
brokers
as
their
sole
source
of
information
about
the
market
of
the
state
into
which
they're
moving.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
it
said
that
it
had
to
be
decided
as
a
factual
question.
it
did
say,
however,
that
the
standards,
the
legal
standards
used
by
the
lower
court
for
disposing
of
that
factual
question
were
erroneous;
the
same
kind
of
argument
we
make
here.
that
--
the
final
touch
of
that
is
that
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
real
estate
transactions
which
is
caused
by
this
increase
in
the
price
of
information
and
service
will
affect
the
interstate
money
market
at
the
same
time
as
it
affects
the
interstate
movement
of
people.
that's
a
rather
straightforward
argument.
the
effect
on
commerce
can
be
traced
clearly
and
unambiguously
in
the
same
way
it
was
traced
in
burke
v.
ford.
and
therefore,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
plaintiffs
should
not
even
be
allowed
to
prove
at
trial
that
interstate
commerce
was
affected
by
this
transaction.
in
fact,
if
the
court
of
appeals
argument
is
that
plaintiff
isn't
even
to
be
allowed
to
prove
it
at
trial,
the
contention
is
that
the
activities
of
brokers
are
completely
outside
the
powers
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
sherman
act,
it's
been
held,
expresses
all
of
the
power
that
congress
has
to
exercise.
and
if
the
sherman
act
expresses
all
of
the
power
congress
has
to
exercise,
and
if,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
sherman
act
does
not
apply
to
the
activities
of
brokers
at
all,
it
must
follow
that
congress
has
no
power
over
brokers.
that
seems
an
extraordinary
proposition
that
congress
has
no
power
over
a
multibillion
dollar
industry
that
affects,
according
to
the
census
figures,
at
least
figures
3
million
people
who
move
from
state
to
state
every
year.
that's
a
rather
significant
affect
on
commerce
for
a
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
argues
that
there
is
none.
in
a
series
of
earlier
cases
--
take,
for
example,
the
perez
case,
which
held
that
the
commerce
clause
reaches
local
loan-sharking
activities;
one
$2,000
loan
made
on
the
streets
of
one
city;
no
proof
of
interstate
commerce;
but
the
commerce
clause
applied
because
lending
activities
as
a
whole
affect
interstate
commerce.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it's
one
of
the
oddities,
i
think,
of
the
sherman
act
cases,
that
that
is
the
standard
at
the
same
time
as
the
holding
is
that
the
sherman
act
expresses
all
of
the
power
that
congress
has
to
exercise.
it's
a
difficult
argument.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
it
is
nonetheless
the
holding.
but
it
applies
sometimes
in
--
it
applies
with
more
or
less
rigor.
and
there
is
an
interesting
difference,
i
think,
in
the
treatment
ordinarily,
in
a
case
like
rex
hospital,
and
the
treatment
in
what
might
be
called
the
failed
conspiracy
cases.
take,
for
example,
the
socony
vacuum
oil
case,
the
famous
early
per
se
rule
case,
in
which
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
sherman
act
applied
and
banned
the
agreement
in
the
socony
vacuum
oil
case.
even
though
there
was
absolutely
no
proof
that
the
agreement
had
been
successful;
the
court
said
well,
it
may
be
that
this
agreement
was
a
miserable
failure,
but
the
sherman
act
applies
nonetheless.
now,
if
you
assume
that
the
agreement
was
a
miserable
failure,
that
it
did
not
achieve
its
objectives,
you're
assuming
at
the
same
time
that
no
commerce
at
all
was
affected.
so
if
you
follow
it
to
that
step
and
say
that
in
a
particular
case
there's
always
a
need
to
prove
substantial
affect
on
commerce,
that's
also
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
the
failed
agreement
cases,
the
attempt
cases,
the
conspiracy
that
breaks
down
before
it
gets
off
the
ground,
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
do
that
unless
the
real
estate
board
of
the
small
town
in
that
hypothetical
was
able
to
show
that
no
one
had
moved
into
or
out
of
that
town
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
the
requirement,
i
think,
and
it's
a
way
that
the
failed
conspiracy
cases
can
be
dealt
with
at
the
same
as
cases
like
rex
hospital,
is
that
the
commerce
subject
to
the
conspiracy
be
substantial;
that
is,
in
the
failed
conspiracy
cases,
one
of
those
failed
conspiracies
was
the
business
of
oil.
there
was
a
lot
of
interstate
commerce
in
oil;
everybody
agreed
that
was
substantial.
in
the
real
estate
business,
the
kind
of
commerce
involved
is
interstate
commerce
in
the
movement
of
people
from
one
state
to
another,
in
the
movement
of
money
from
banks
across
state
lines
in
the
secondary
market
in
real
estate
financing
purchases
by
institutions
like
the
government
national
mortgage
association.
that's
clearly
substantial
here.
it's
substantial
in
the
same
way
that
it
was
substantial
in
the
failed
conspiracy
cases.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
i
think
that
to
be
the
holding
in
perez.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
it
--
the
test
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
do
you
concede
that
this--the
test
was
quite
different?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
right.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
of
course,
and
that's
what
most
of
the
gun
cases
say,
guns
that
have
travelled
in
interstate
commerce,
or
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
but
there's
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
uh-huh,
but
there's
been
an
interesting
difference
even
between
those
cases
and
the
sherman
act
cases,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
the
gun
cases,
there
has
been
a
series
of
decisions
that
the
travel
of
even
a
single
gun
from
one
state
to
another,
the
statute
that
says,
"in
or
affects
commerce"
meets
the
in-or-affects-commerce
test.
if
that's
what
"in
or
affects
commerce"
means,
and
the
gun
cases
certainly
hold
that,
the
same
reasoning
applied
to
the
sherman
act
would
mean
that
travel
of
even
a
single
dollar
or
a
single
person.
and
there's
some
tension
between
that
line
of
cases
and
the
language
in
the
sherman
act
cases
saying
the
effect
has
to
be
substantial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
even
though
the
language
of
the
statutes
is
very
similar.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
saying.
there
is,
in
fact,
a
brief
paragraph
on
pages
41
and
42
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
saying
that
we
recognized
that
we
have
today
made
the
very
strong
holding
that
congress
has
no
power
over
the
real
estate
business.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
certainly,
the
new
orleans
real
estate
brokerage
business,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
i
think
so.
as
the
court,
before
it
got
to
page
39,
had
just
spent
two
pages
discussing
the
argument
that
plaintiff
should
be
allowed
an
opportunity
to
prove
on
trial
some
of
the
allegations
in
their
complaint.
and
it
said
they
weren't
entitled
even
to
that
opportunity
to
prove
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
yes.
and
in
the
allegations
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce,
one
of
the
questions
that
the
plaintiffs
propounded
in
an
interrogatory,
for
example,
was
state
the
number
of
people
who
cross
state
lines
to
use
your
service?
who
go
from
one
state
to
the
other
by
use
of
your
service?
that
question
appears
in
the
interrogatories
at
pages
91
and
101.
the
respondents,
the
defendants,
objected
even
to
answering
that
interrogatory;
it
was
never
answered.
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
holding
is
that
interstate
commerce
--
it
can
be
known
to
a
certainty
that
interstate
commerce
is
not
affected,
even
though
we
have
no
idea
how
many
people
cross
state
lines
to
use
the
service.
that
is,
i
think
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
the
judge,
after
receiving
the
response,
simply
took
the
case
under
advisement,
and
then
dismissed
it
under
rule
12,
without
ever
dealing
with
the
objection
to
the
taking
of
the
interrogatories.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
there
was
no
motion
to
compel
discovery.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
he
--
on
appeal,
the
plaintiff
did
not
assign
as
error
any
of
the
particular
refusals
to
answer,
but
instead
made
the
more
general
argument
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
trial.
that
more
general
argument
i
think
would
comprehend
the
particulars
of,
"they
didn't
answer
this
question,
the
didn't
answer
that
question,
they
didn't
answer
the
following
question."
but
there
was
no
motion
to
compel
discovery;
in
that
sense,
the
procedural
"t's"
were
not
crossed.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
i
think
the
result
would
have
been
quite
the
same,
from
the
court
of
appeals
point
of
view.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
if
--
it
would
be
the
same
if
the
fee
were
increased
by
any
amount
by
the
price-fixing.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
let
me
suggest,
by
the
way,
that
that's
an
important
difference
between
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
yes,
yes.
but
i
think
it's
important,
though,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
yes,
that's
certainly
our
assumption.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
understand,
and
this
complements
the
goldfarb
arguments,
the
goldfarb
case
was
decided
on
the
explicit
assumption
that
what
lawyers
did
had
no
effect
on
prices,
something
that
the
court's
opinion
said
twice,
that
is,
there
had
been
no
claim
that
in
fact
prices
went
up.
the
problem
in
showing
interstate
commerce
in
goldfarb,
on
the
assumption
that
the
lawyers'
price
had
not
been
increased
by
this
fee
schedule,
was
how
to
show
any
effect
on
commerce
at
all.
in
that
sense
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbook
oh,
i'm
not
disputing
that
in
any
way.
my
observation
was
only
that
they
all
felt
free
to
follow
this
fixed
rate.
there
had
been
no
particular
allegation
that
this
fixed
rate
was
higher
than
the
rate
that
would
prevail
in
the
market.
and
so
in
that
sense,
finding
that
the
lawyers
were
indispensable
to
the
interstate
commerce
was
essential
to
finding
an
affect
on
interstate
commerce.
here
the
allegation
is
that
the
rate
has
been
change,
and
so
you
find
a
different
change
of
causation
--
different
chain
of
causation
to
the
effect
on
commerce.
thank
you.
