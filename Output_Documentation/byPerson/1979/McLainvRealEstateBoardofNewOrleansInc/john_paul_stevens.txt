mr.
mccall
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
you
have
referred
a
couple
of
times
to
trying
to
case
on
one
theory.
there
really
was
not
a
trial
here,
was
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
a
granting
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
court
treated
it
as
though
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
supported
by
affidavits,
which
is
treated
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
depositions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
in
that
kind
of
disposition
all
factual
inferences
are
taken
most
favorably
to
the
losing
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
there
any
findings
of
fact
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
proceedings
in
--
before
the
trial
judge
of
cross-examining
witnesses
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
normally,
when
you
have
a
motion
to
dismiss
supported
by
affidavits
and
treated
as
a
summary
judgment,
you
basically
say,
well,
the
issues
are
either
undisputed,
or
if
there
is
a
dispute,
you
take
the
view
of
the
facts
most
favorable
to
the
losing
party.
isn't
that
the
customary
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
wouldn't
that
rule
apply
to
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
judge,
in
effect,
says,
"well,
i
take
everything
you
have
proved,
and
assuming
it
to
be
true,
it's
still
not
enough."
isn't
that
the
normal
way
you
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supported
by
affidavits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
couldn't
have
been
an
issue
of
material
fact,
or
the
judgment--or
the
court
couldn't
have
entered
a
judgment,
could
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
after
the
argument
on
whatever
was
submitted,
there
couldn't
be
an
outstanding
issue
of
material
fact,
could
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
have
--
permit
the
court
to
enter
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
where
was
it
--
what
factual
finding
did
the
court
come
to
except
that
there
is
no
factual
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
came
to
a
legal
conclusion
that
there
was
no
showing
of
an
effect
on
commerce,
or
there
was
--
or
whatever,
his
standard
was,
he
didn't
think
the
facts
in
the
record
satisfied
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
a
--
is
that
what
you
call
a
factual
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
factual
finding
although
he
wasn't
entitles
to
make
factual
findings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because,
at
the
very
end
of
the
trial
court's
opinion,
in
footnote
7,
after
all
this
took
place.
page
23a.
"in
any
event,
no
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
appears
to
preclude
judgment
in
defendants'
favor
pursuant
to
rule
56."
it
seems
to
me
at
the
very
bottom
line
of
his
opinion
is,
after
everything's
all
over,
is,
there
is
no
genuine
issue
of
fact.
which
means
to
me
that
he's
assuming
the
facts
most
favorable
to
the
other
side.
that's
the
standard
boilerplate
you
use
in
that
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
i
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
is
it
the
question
of
what
is
substantial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
it
does
that?
you
would
agree
that
that
would
have
an
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
six
percent,
doesn't
have
enough
of
an
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
only
way
--
isn't
the
only
way
that--or
is
it
the
only
way
that
the
agreed-upon
brokerage
rate
can
affect
the
mortgage
market
by
interstate
travel
is
by
affecting
the
price
of
the
house?
