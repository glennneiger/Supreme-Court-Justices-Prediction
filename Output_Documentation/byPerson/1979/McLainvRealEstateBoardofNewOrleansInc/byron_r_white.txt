what
is
the
--
what
is
the
brokerage
rate
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
essentially
claiming
that
--
that
the
absence
of
competition
between
real
estate
brokers
has
an
affect
on
interstate
commerce?
justice

in
terms

--
absence

in
terms

justice

price-fixing,
price-fixing
among
brokers
in
terms
of
their
brokerage
rate,
their
charge,
the
6
percent,
affects
interstate
commerce;
that's
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
were
competing,
if
they
were
free,
if
each
individual
was
free
to
reduce
his
rate,
what
would
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore,
what?
if
the
price
went
down
on
a
house,
it
would
sell
even
more
easily,
and
it
would--i
suppose
it
would
sell
more
easily
to
out
of
state
buyers,
just
like
it
would
sell
more
easily
to
in-state
buyers.
justice
byron
r.
white
logic
aside,
the
test
had
been
applied
differently.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
plaintiffs
take
that
unanswered
question
to
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
they
attempt
to
get
an
order
to
answer
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
before
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the--on
the
theory
the
court
of
appeals
used,
if
the
brokerage
rate,
agreed-upon
brokerage
rate,
was
20
percent
instead
of
6,
or
even
50,
that
the
result
would
have
been
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
it
was
1
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
i
take
it
your
assumption
that
inevitably
the
price
is
higher
than
it
would
be
if
the
agreed
rate
--
the
price
of
real
estate
is
higher
that
if
the
agreed
rate
were
one
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
there
was
competition,
prices
would
be
lower
in
some
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
a
factual
--
is
it
any
kind
of
a
factual
conclusion
that
is
entitled
to
the
respect
of
a
two-court
fact
finding?
such
as
you
have
suggested
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
wouldn't
think
you
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
--what
if
real
estate
brokerage
were
50
percent?
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
or
not?
an
agreed-upon
--
an
agreement
among
brokers
not
to
compete,
and
that
their
agreed
brokerage
rate
was
50
percent.
and
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
that
kind
of
a
brokerage
charge
to
a
seller
might
cause
him
to
raise
his
house
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
don't
skip
over
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
it
has
an
effect
on
house
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
no
agreement,
and
people
were
free
to
compete,
you
don't
think
house
prices
would
ever
be
lower?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
some
broker
decided
to
cut
his
rate
to
two
percent,
i
suppose
a
seller
might
be
willing
to
cut
his
price
some.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
ask
--
you
wouldn't
ask
for
independent
proof
if
the
rate
was
50
percent,
would
you?
you
just
said
you
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
supposes
--
what
should
a
trial
judge
do,
for
anti-trust
purposes,
when
he's
making
a
--
when
he's
going
to
resolve
that
at
the
beginning
of
a
case?
should
he
resolve
that
in
your
favor
or
the
other
side's
favor?
when
you
say,
i
just
can't
be
sure
that
it
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
should
say,
the
plaintiff
hasn't
proved
it,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
even
if
you
admit
all
this,
it's
irrelevant
so
far
as
the
federal
anti-trust
laws
go
if
it's
all
in
the
intrastate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that,
of
course,
was
not
the
kind
of
restraint
--
not
a
business-type
restraint,
rather
than
because
the
commerce
power
didn't
reach
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
apex
case,
it
sort
of
went
off
on
the
theory
that
a
labor
dispute
is
not
the
kind
of
restraint
that
the
sherman
act
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
believe
it
did,
too.
