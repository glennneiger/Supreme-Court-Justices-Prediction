mr.
richard
g.
vinet
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
anti-trust
suit.
it
was
brought
seeking
triple
damages
and
an
injunction
against
the
real
estate
brokers
in
new
orleans,
louisiana.
the
plaintiffs
are
buyers
and
sellers
of
one-
to
four-family
homes
in
new
orleans.
they
bring
this
suit
on
their
own
behalf,
and
also
as
a
class
action.
the
defendants
are
two
local
professional
associations
of
realtors,
six
real
estate
firms
who
variously
dealt
with
the
plaintiffs
in
their
own
transactions;
and
finally,
a
defendant
class
consisting
of
all
the
real
estate
agents
and
brokers
who
operated
in
the
new
orleans
area
during
the
limitation
period
of
the
suit.
your
honors,
the
suit
charges
price
fixing
in
commissions
for
the
sale
of
real
estate
brokerage
services.
the
effects
on
the
plaintiffs
are
alleged
to
be
that
the
prices
of
homes
are
artificially
raised
to
buyers
and/or
that
the
proceeds
received
by
sellers,
when
they
sell
their
homes,
are
artificially
reduced.
the
factors
of
interstate
commerce
involved
in
the
transactions
are
the
financing
aspects
of
the
sales;
the
title
insurance
aspects
of
the
sale;
and
also,
governmental
loan
guarantees
through
the
federal
government.
defendants,
after
the
suit
was
filed,
moved
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
it
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted,
or
that
alternatively,
any
claim
that
it
might
have
stated
didn't
arise
under
either
federal
question
jurisdiction
or
under
diversity.
the
realtors
state
that
their
activities
are
not
in
interstate
commerce,
and
their
activities
don't
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce.
the
suit
was
filed
in
october
of
'75,
and
in
the
fall
of
'76,
the
trial
court
ordered
discovery
to
be
had
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
specifically,
the
discovery
was
designed
to
show
whether
or
not
there
was
a
substantial
involvement
of
interstate
commerce
in
the
real
estate
transactions;
and
secondly,
whether
brokerage--or
real
estate
brokerage--was
a
necessary
and
integral
part
of
the
transaction
which
was,
in
the
words
of
the
trial
court,
inseparable
from
its
interstate
aspects.
pursuant
to
the
discovery
order,
depositions
were
taken
and
submitted
to
the
court.
thereafter,
the
case
was
dismissed.
the
trial
judge
failed
to
find
a
sufficient
nexus
with
interstate
commerce
to
justify
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction.
the
judgment
was
later
affirmed
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
this
past
may,
this
court
granted
certiorari.
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honors,
the
allegation
of
the
complaint,
and
the
evidence
that
we
developed
from
discovery,
support
the
exercise
of
anti-trust
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
because
these
transactions
involve
land
does
not
limit
the
application
of
traditional
jurisdictional
analysis
to
the
facts
that
we
alleged
and
the
facts
that
we
adduced.
realtors
don't
sell
land,
your
honors;
they
sell
service,
or
more
properly,
an
array
of
services
which
are
indispensable
to
the
buyer
or
seller
of
homes
in
today's
real
estate
markets.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
i
think
we've
raised
the
point
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
we
had
no
discovery
on
the
issue,
or
the
merits,
the
price-fixing
issue.
and
we've
contended
that
the--that
the
ultimate
fact
of
the
lawsuit--the
price-fixing
is
also
a
jurisdictional
fact.
that
wasn't
the
point
i
was
making
just
now,
however,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
it's
a
little
bit
of
both,
your
honor.
but
essentially,
i
think
the
trial
court
interpreted
this
court's
decision
in
goldfarb
to
require
something
alone
the
lines
of
an
in-commerce
showing
in
order
to
justify
jurisdiction.
that's
why
he
talked
about
necessary
and
integral,
and
inseparable
from
the
interstate
aspects.
i
think
he
was
looking
for
some
sort
of
a
procedural
relationship,
much
like--you've
got
to
have
a
title--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
yes,
your
honor,
but
not
because
it
found
facts
that
didn't
exist,
but
because
it
applied
a
standard
that
wasn't
broad
enough.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
your
honor,
goldfarb
is
distinct
from
this
case.
goldfarb--well,
yes,
in
the
sense
that
your
honor
cited
the
opinion
by
saying
that,
were
they
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
or
did
their
activities
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce?
well,
i
believe
that
your
honor
found,
in
fact,
that
they
were
more
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
than
they
were
affecting
interstate
commerce,
in
the
sense
of
the
mandeville
island
kind
of
cases.
it's
more
like
yellow
cab,
where
the
ride
between
the
train
stations
was
part
of
the
journey.
that's
what
the
title
lawyers
were
like.
now,
we're
saying
the
realtors
aren't
like
that.
they're
a
little
bit
different.
their
effect
on
interstate
commerce
is
more
of
an
economic
thing;
it's
more
of
a
structural
way
that
the
real
estate
market
functions.
in
fact,
i
was
just
going
to
talk
about
that,
about
how
the
real
estate
market
actually
works.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
we
have
a
factual
finding
to
the
effect
that
real
estate
brokers
don't
stand
in
quite
the
same
relationship
to
the
transaction
as
title
lawyers
do,
your
honor.
and
in
that
sense,
we
lost
the
case.
because
i
believe
that
we--the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
expected
us
to
show
that.
but
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
that's
it,
your
honor.
they
should
have
applied
an
affectation
of
commerce
standard
as
opposed
to
an
in-commerce
standard,
is
essentially
what
we're--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
on,
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
evidence
we've
developed,
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
allegations
of
the
petition,
for
which
there
was
neither
evidence
nor
discovery,
would
support
a
jurisdictional
finding.
and
i
believe
that
your
honors
could
find
that
in
fact
jurisdiction
does
exist
on
this
record,
as
it
exists
right
now
in
terms
of
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
indeed
you
did,
your
honor;
that's
very
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
well,
no,
your
honor,
we
weren't
seeking
a
summary
judgment.
the
realtors
were
in
the
sense
of
that.
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
your
honor,
all
we're
asking
you
to
say
is
that
we're
entitled
to
go
back
and
have
a
trial.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
i
don't
know
if
there
were
factual
disputes,
your
honor.
the
question
was
simply
what
facts
we
had
to
show.
if
we
had
to
show
that
real
estate
brokers
are
like
title
lawyers,
and
that
you
can't
get
along
without
a
real
estate
broker,
well
then,
no,
we
didn't
show
that,
because
that's
not
true.
if
we
had
to
show
that
what
a
realtor
does
in
bringing
together
a
buyer
and
seller
is
a
necessary
concomitant
of
the
real
estate
market
just
as
finding
your
title--finding
your
financing
in
interstate
commerce,
and
that
without
both
of
those
elements
working
together,
you
don't
have
a
real
estate
market;
if
we
had
to
show
that,
i
think
we
have
shown
it,
and
i
think
that
justifies
the
court
exercising
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
well,
i
think
that
they
would--they
have,
in
fact,
testified
that
the
majority
of
real
estate
transactions,
in
fact
60
percent
of
real
estate
transactions
in
new
orleans
--
i'm
sorry,
in
a
majority
in
new
orleans,
they
testified,
are
handled
through
real
estate
brokers.
nationwide
the
figure
is
about
60
percent.
i
think
that
from
that
we
can
deduce
that
60
percent
of
loans
are
granted,
60
percent
of
title
policies
are
written,
60
percent
of
va
and
fha
loans
are
granted,
because
somehow,
somewhere,
a
real
estate
agent
has
performed
his
function
of
getting
a
listing,
finding
a
buyer,
bringing
them
together,
and
confecting
a
purchase
agreement.
i
think
that
that
--
that's
a
conclusion
that
can
apply
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
the
real
estate
agents
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
in
new
orleans,
your
honor,
it's
6
percent.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
indeed
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
well,
your
honor,
we
can't
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
yes,
your
honor,
we
taken
that
position.
we
say
that
the
6
percent
itself
quantitatively
affects
movement
of
resources
in
commerce
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
housing
prices
would
largely
go
down,
particularly
in
the
houses
which
are
the
easiest
to
sell.
i
mean,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
not
all
houses
are
equally
difficult
to
sell.
and
the
easier
ones
to
sell,
you
could
sell
them
cheaper.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
buyers--the
buyers
would
have
to
finance
relatively
less
of
the
purchase
price;
the
sellers
would
receive
relatively
more
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
okay.
well,
your
honor,
if
you
assume
that
--
in
the
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
okay.
well,
your
honor,
let's
assume
that
the
price
goes
up
because
of
the
price-fixing.
if
the
amount
of
money
that
you
finance
on
the
home
is
equal
to,
say,
80
percent
of
the
appraised
value;
and
the
downpayment
is
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
amount
that
you
can
finance
and
the
amount
that
the
home
costs,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
that's
it,
your
honor.
and
some
people
may
even
be
driven
out
of
the
market
altogether,
and
won't
participate
in
any
of
the
interstate
transactions
to
obtain
money
at
all
if
the
price
goes
too
high
as
a
result
of
price-fixing.
it's
the
presence
of
an
artificial
and
non-competitive
element
of
the
cost
of
the
house.
but
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
yes,
your
honor.
no,
we
are
dealing
here
only
with
residential
real
property;
in
other
words,
property
with
houses
on
it,
one-
to
four-family.
we
have
no
standing,
i
think,
to
talk
about
raw
land
or
commercial
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
real
estate
brokers
handle
those,
but
i
don't
know
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
no,
sir,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
mr.
justice
powell?
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true;
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
we
have
always
taken
the
position
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
well,
yes,
your
honor,
we
were
not
able
to
go
beyond
the
scope
of
trying
to
bring
the
case
within
the
factual
pattern
of
goldfarb.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
which
--
well,
it
turns
out
to
be
that
way.
i
don't
think
any
of
us
really
talked
about
it
in
terms
of
in-commerce
or
affectation
of
commerce
at
that
time.
but
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and,
well,
you
can
find
it
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
for
example,
they
took
the
position
that
the
question
of
whether
they
fix
prices
is
a
separate
analytical
concept
divorced
from
the
threshold
jurisdictional
issue.
and
that's
what
we
faced
all
along.
we
were
stopped
at
the
threshold,
and
couldn't
get
beyond
that
to
the
merits
of
the
suit.
i
believe
that
the
ultimate
facts
in
this
case
are
jurisdictional.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
think
we
were,
at
that
time,
characterizing
goldfarb
as
an
in-commerce
as
opposed
to
an
affection
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
we
--
that
is
not
our
primary
grievance.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
in
fact
a
section
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
right.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
well,
that's
the
position
that
they
take.
and
we
say
that
that's
wrong.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
rest
of
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
oh,
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
i
was
going
to
say
--
your
honor,
we
took
the
position
throughout
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
we
could
have
had
discovery
to
show
that
these
realtors
--
and
produce
evidence
that
these
realtors
engaged
in
price-fixing,
we
could
have
beat
the
jurisdictional
issue.
that
became
important
when
the
fifth
circuit
recharacterized
the
dismissal
as
a
factual
tack
on
jurisdiction
whereby
the
allegations
of
the
petition
were
no
longer
accorded
the
presumption
of
truthfulness.
and
that's
what
happened
to
us
with
that
contention.
because
at
that
point
we
could
no
longer
even
rely
on
our
complaint
as
providing
a
factual
basis
for
the
court
to
rule
on.
your
honors,
we
would
just
--
earlier
i
mentioned
the
primary
function
of
the
broker
is
bringing
buyer
and
seller
together.
and
in
trying
to
show
the
relationship
between
the
local
activity
of
brokerage
and
the
interstate
activity
of
financing
and
title
insurance
as
being
necessary
concomitants
of
the
local
market
and
the
land,
i
would
like
to
suggest
some
of
the
other
things
that
brokers
do.
not
only
do
they
secure
the
listing
and
find
you
a
buyer
and
take
care
of
the
purchase
agreement,
they
counsel
purchasers.
they
know
about
the
money
market.
they
counsel
sellers
about
the
land
market.
they
know
about
the
va
and
the
fha
and
they
tell
you
how
you
can
qualify.
they
provide
assistance,
logistical
support,
liaison
with
the
attorneys,
with
the
title
examiners,
with
the
other
professionals
involved,
like
the
appraisers
and
surveyors.
when
you
have
a
problem,
you
call
the
agent.
if
you
need
a
title,
the
agent
brings
it
over.
if
you've
got--
you
need
your
termite
inspection,
the
agent
will
arrange
it
for
you.
the
realtor
is
interested
in
pushing
the
sale
through.
because
after
all,
he's
not
going
to
get
paid
unless
the
sale
takes
place.
and
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
your
honor,
there
are
some
louisiana
cases
which
say
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
cases
--
let
me
explain
the
factual
context
in
which
those
cases
arise.
he
brings
a
willing
buyer
and
the
willing
seller
together,
and
if
for
some
reason
the
buyer
changes
his
mind
and
decides
to
back
out
of
the
sale
or
they
try
and
gyp
him
out
of
his
commission,
the
courts
have
held
that
he's
got
a
cause
of
action
to
cover
his
commission.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
as
a
practical
matter,
however,
the
purchase
agreement
--
we
have
deposition
testimony
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
derbes,
page
--
appendix
page
263,
to
the
effect
that
the
listing
agreement,
or
the
purchase
agreement
will
provide
that
a
good
faith
effort
has
to
be
made
to
get
the
loan,
but
payment
of
the
commission
is
contingent
upon
the
obtaining
of
financing.
and
that's
the
basis
of
my
saying
that
they
push
the
transaction
through
so
that
they
can
be
paid.
your
honors,
realtors
know
the
local
money
market.
they
sometimes
even
escort
purchasers
to
lending
institutions.
and
lending
institutions
are
quite
aware
of
the
importance
of
realtors
as
a
source
of
referral
business.
we
have
evidence
that
caruth
mortgage
company
sends
brochures
to
300
people
a
week
about
their
interest
rates,
and
trying
to
entice
people
to
come
in.
and
the
same
with
security
homestead
daily
they're
in
contact
with
real
estate
agents,
seeking
interest
quotes.
the
same

all
of
these
related
services
that
are
in
interstate
commerce
recognize
the
importance
of
the
realtor
to
their
operations
and
to
the
continued
operation
of
the
land
market.
the
realtors
sell
expertise.
they
sell
know-how.
they
make
the
local
market
land,
and
they
merchandise
houses
as
a
commodity.
now,
if
the
local
housing
market
depends
on
real
estate
brokers,
it's
equally
dependent
on
interstate
commerce.
we've
at
great
length
in
our
brief
talked
about
all
the
substantial
amounts
of
money
involved;
about
how
it
comes
from
depositors
who
are
located
out
of
state
or
in-state;
how
advances
are
secured
by
homesteads
from
the
federal
home
loan
bank;
about
how
the
secondary
market
operates
and

and

mr.
richard
g.
vinet
well,
your
honor,
it's
the
right
language,
but
it
wouldn't
make
sense.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
well,
no
--
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
"substantially
affects,"
for
the
purposes
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
lower
court,
meant
the
same
thing
as
"in
commerce."
they
were
the
same
test.
"necessary
and
integral
part
of
the
interstate
transaction,
inseparable
from
its
interstate
aspects,"
which
is
what
this--the
court's
language
in
goldfarb.
that's
how
the
court
found
jurisdiction
in
goldfarb.
and
our
opinion,
or
our
position,
is
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
perhaps
feeling
that
land
is
completely
unique
and
it
doesn't
cross
state
lines,
or
it
doesn't
move
in
commerce,
feeling
all
that
to
be
the
case,
that
the
district
court
just
took
that
same
language,
and
they
said,
well,
that's
the
way
the
supreme
court
found
jurisdiction
in
goldfarb,
and
that's
the
only
way
it
can
be
the
quintessential
local
product.
and
they
use
the
language,
substantial
effect,
your
honor,
but
if
you
read
the
opinion,
you're
going
to
see
that
what
they
wanted
us
to
show
was
that
real
estate
brokers
are
like
title
lawyers.
and
we
didn't
show
that.
what
we
showed
was
a
market
dependence
on
local
activity
of
real
estate
brokers,
and
upon
interstate
commerce,
to
keep
the
market
going.
if
realtors
make
the
market,
interstate
commerce
permits
it
to
survive.
mr.
richard
g.
vinet
thank
you.
