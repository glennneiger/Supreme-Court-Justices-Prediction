justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
vinet,
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
your
contention.
it
isn't
that
you
should
have
had
more
of
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
on
the
interstate
commerce
or
affecting
interstate
commerce
aspects
in
the
district
court.
it's
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
district
court
should
have
ruled
in
your
favor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
necessary
connection
with
interstate
commerce,
which
the
trial
court
found
was
lacking?
is
it
that
you
didn't
have
enough
chance
to
develop
your
case
on
that,
or
that
the
trial
court,
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit,
simply
was
wrong
on
the
evidence
before
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's--but
on
the
facts,
if
it
had
applied
the
right
standard,
you
should
have
won?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
basically
a
factual
question.
you
have
a
factual
finding
by
the
district
court,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
against
you
on
that
point,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
they
should
have
applied
a
different
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
supposing
we
agree
with
you?
do
we
then
send
the
case
back
for
those
courts
to
apply
the--what
we
decide
is
the
proper
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
we
say
in
the
rex
case
a
couple
years
ago,
written
by
justice
marshall,
that
summary
judgment
rulings,
rulings
on
a
question
as
a
matter
of
law,
were
not
favored
in
this
kind
of
a
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
make--to
find
a
summary
judgment,
is
to
enter
summary
judgment
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
weren't
there
factual
disputes
even
on
the
jurisdictional
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
your
opponents
in
effect
concede
that?
what
you
just
said?
there
isn't
any
factual
dispute
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
all
right;
it's
a
mirror
image.
[laughter.]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
vinet,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
at
page
39a
of
your
petition
for
certiorari,
which
is
a
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
the
paragraph
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
"with
our
endorsement
of
the
district
court's
determination
that
this
particular
real
estate
activity
neither
occurs
in,
nor
substantially
affects,
interstate
commerce."
now,
do
you
say
that's
the
wrong
standard
to
be
applied
fox
jurisdictional
purposes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
attacking
a
factual
finding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
two
courts
have
decided
against
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
real
estate
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
was
involved.
the
quotation
i
just
read
from
their
opinion
says,
this
particular
real
estate
activity,
which
i
take
it
is
brokerage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
explain
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
understanding
of
rex
that
it
held,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
there
was
jurisdiction,
or
simply
it
said
that
the
trial
court
should
have
decided
it
as
a
factual
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
not
the
same
standard
as
you
use
on
an
anti-trust
case.
you
have
to
prove
the
fact
that
your
particular
case
has
an
affect
on
commerce.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
it
nonetheless
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
it's
impossible
to
logically
conclude
that
the
real
estate
board
of
greater
new
york
city
is
engaged
in
activities
which
affect
commerce,
but
the
real
estate
board
of
a
town
in
the
shenandoah
valley
in
virginia
is
not
engaged
in
those
activities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there's
no
substantial
requirement
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
plaintiff
didn't
assign
that
as
error?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
trial
court
can't
resolve
factual
disputes,
if
the
plaintiffs'
affidavit
shows
one
thing
and
the
defendants'
another,
he
can't
make
a
finding
of
fact.
he
--
as
justice
stevens
says,
he
has
to
resolve
any
dispute
like
that
in
favor
of
the
party
against
whom
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
directed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
--
i'm
not
--
i
don't
think
i
fully
understand
that.
because
you
could
have
a
proceeding
on
affidavits
plus
depositions,
or
you
could
have
by
consent
or
presumably
by
the
trial
judge's
order,
a
severed
issue
from
a
trial,
and
say,
we're
going
to
have
a
trial
of
fact
on
this
issue,
and
i'm
going
to
hear
witnesses,
or
whatever
submissions
you
have,
and
then
i'm
going
to
make
a
finding
of
fact.
and
i'm
not
sure
from
hearing
all
of
the
counsel
what
it
was
that
happened.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whose
motion
to
dismiss
was
it?
