mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
initially
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
because
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
more
important
questions
before
this
court.
and
that
question
was,
whether
we
contend
that
there
was
a
factual
issue?
and
the
short
answer
to
that
question
is,
we
not
only
do
not
concede
that
there
is
no
factual
issue,
but
we
contend
that
there
was
a
factual
issue,
and
that
the
factual
issue
was
adversely
resolved
against
these
petitioners,
and
that
absent
some
showing
of
clear
error,
that
that
factual
resolution
should
stand.
second,
as
to
the
contention
that
these
petitioners
were
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
show
the
effect
on
commerce,
and
that
they
were
restricted
by
reason
of
the
district
court's
order
limiting
them
to
the
goldfarb
case,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
petitioners
embraced
goldfarb
closely
and
joyously
from
the
very
beginning.
the
term
that
they
used
in
some
of
their
memoranda
was
that
"goldfarb
loves
the
instant
case."
now
it
followed
from
that
when
the
district
judge
called
his
pre-trial
conference
in
september
and
suggested
that
there
be
discovery,
he
was
following
precisely
the
lead
that
petitioners
had
suggested
that
he
follow.
he
said,
you
have
talked
about
goldfarb;
i'm
going
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
show
that
goldfarb
did,
in
fact,
as
you
say,
love
this
case.
the
question
was
asked
whether
there
was
any
objection
on
petitioner's
part
to
that
alleged
limit
to
petitioner's
discovery.
and
the
answer
is,
no.
this
record
will
be
examined
with
care,
and
there
will
be
no
indication
of
any
objection
whatsoever.
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
concept
of
affecting
interstate
commerce
through
the
alleged
affect
on
the
sale
of
houses
by
reason
of
the
supposed
fixed
commission
is
an
afterthought.
and
what
this
court
is
being
asked
to
do
is,
to
supply
what
these
petitioners
didn't
supply
in
the
lower
court.
this
court
is
not
being
asked
to
review
whether,
on
the
facts
before
it,
the
district
court
reached
the
correct
decision.
it's
not
being
asked
whether,
on
the
record
before
it,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
affirmed
the
holding
of
the
lower
court.
what
this
court
is
being
asked
to
do
is
to
go
behind
the
record,
and
to
assume
that
had
these
petitioners
put
on
a
different
case,
that
the
result
would
have
been
different.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
lies
in
the
portion
that
was
read
either
by
yourself
or
one
of
the
justices,
namely,
on
this
particular
case.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
make
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
or
these
particular
circumstances.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
stand
corrected,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
language
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
but
as
i
read
the
phrase,
"this
particular
real
estate
activity,"
it
relates
to
the
particular
activity
with
respect
to
which
there
was
evidence
before
the
court;
and
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was,
that
it
restricted
its
holding
to
the
facts
which
it
had
before
it;
and
that
it
did
not
make
a
sweeping
holding
that
under
no
circumstances
could
there
be
a
situation
in
which
real
estate
brokers
might
not
have
some
affect--effect--on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
we
have
a
better
situation
than
that,
because
this
--
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
--
decision
was
not
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
but
this
decision
was
rendered
after
these
petitioners
had
the
opportunity
to
adduce
evidence
in
support
of
their
allegation.
and
i
think
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
realize,
to
recall,
that
it
was
in
september,
i
believe
early
in
september,
that
the
district
judge
entered
his
order
saying
that
discovery
should
take
place.
and
as
i
have
pointed
out,
there
was
no
objection
to
that.
the
record
is
completely
silent
on
any
objection
by
these
petitioners
at
that
time,
or
at
any
other
time,
to
the
supposed
limits
on
discovery.
now,
what
the
judge
did
was,
he
said,
i'm
going
to
order
discovery
--
all
this
appears
in
the
record.
and
a
month
later
he
called
another
pre-trial
conference,
and
he
said.
"i
will
give
you
until
december
31st"--it
was
then
early
in
october--"in
which
to
complete
your
discovery."
no
objection
at
that
time,
no
suggestion
that
the
breadth
of
the
discovery
should
be
increased.
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
december
that
the
first
notice
of
taking
a
deposition
was
issued.
on
or
about
december
21st,
i
think
it
was,
these
petitioners
moved
to
extend
the
time
in
which
their
discovery
could
be
conducted.
and
it
will
be
noted
that
that
motion
does
not
recite
that
they
were
improperly
restricted
as
to
what
their
scope
of
discovery
should
be.
the
basis
for
that
motion
was,
that
they
didn't
have
time
to
set
up
the
depositions,
that
they
were
having
difficulty
in
getting
the
deponents.
so
i
would
say
that
i
think
that
we
should
lay
at
rest
my
suggestion
that
the
district
court
improperly,
in
any
way,
limited
the
discovery
by
these
petitioners.
because
had
they
really
thought
that
there
was
such
limit,
clearly
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
say
so.
you
don't
come
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
say,
the
court
has
improperly
instructed
the
jury,
without
taking
exception
to
the
jury
charges.
and
for
these
petitioners
now
to
say,
"well,
we
tried
our
cases
on
one
theory
below,
and
we
adduced
evidence
on
that,
but
had
we
thought
about
it
as
we
now
think
about
it,
we
would
have
put
in
different
evidence."
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
was
no
trial
as
such.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
but
what
there
was
was
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
predicated
on
evidence
submitted
by
these
petitioners.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
well,
more
than
an
affidavit,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
was
actual
evidence
taken.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
that
the
rule
that
applies
there
is
the
"clearly
erroneous"
rule.
you
had
a
factual
determination
on
evidence.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
not
as
such,
no.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
sir.
all
that
was
done
by
deposition.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
in
general,
i
think,
yes,
that
is
the
rule.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
it
applies
in
this
case,
because
you
don't
have
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
summary
judgment
in
the
conventional
sense.
it
seemso
me
that
where
the
petitioners
have
the
opportunity
to
take
their
evidence,
and
actually
do
so
by
contradictory
depositions
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
not
where
evidence
is
submitted
by
both
sides,
as
i
appreciate
it,
as
it
is
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
that
is
correct,
where
you
have
affidavits,
as
i
appreciate
it,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
what
we
had
here,
in
effect,
was
a
separate
trial
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
well,
it's
our
appreciation
of
what
happened
is
that
the
trial
judge
first,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
submitted
on
affidavits.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
it
was
the
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
respondent
realtors.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
yes.
those
affidavits
are
in
the
record,
the
two
affidavits.
that
motion
was
opposed
by
affidavits
submitted
in
behalf
of
the
petitioners.
and
that
motion
was
then
argued.
and
it
was
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
at
that
point,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
at
that
point,
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
well
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
yes,
if
you
will
bear
in
mind
that
subsequent
to
the
hearing--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
well,
that's
where
i
--
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
white--you
and
i
disagree.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
because
following
the
hearing
on
the
motion
on
the
affidavits,
there
was
an
order
permitting
these
plaintiffs
to
take
evidence,
which
they
did.
and
it
was
only
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence
that
the
court
then
made
its
findings
of
fact,
and
reached
its
conclusion
as
expressed
in
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
he
did
so
find
that.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
but
let
me
then
suggest
to
your
honors
that
even
if
you
treat
it
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
which
you
resolve
the
issues
most
favorably
to
the
person
against
whom
the
decision
goes,
that
you
still
have
a
decision
which
is
correct
on
the
facts
and
on
the
law.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i'm
afraid
i
have
to
back
down
on
that
one,
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
like
to
do
it.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
but
i
can't
answer
your
question
any
other
way.
and
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
it
doesn't
do
my
argument
any
good
about
the
factual
issue,
in
the
absence
of
a
"clearly
erroneous"
rule.
let
me
then,
if
i
may,
address
what
i
would
formally
have
considered
my
second
line
of
defense
on
that,
and
say
to
your
honors
that
irrespective
of
whether
you
consider
this
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
with
all
doubts
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
these
petitioners,
that
then
i
say
that
there
is
no
issue
which
can
be
resolved
favorably
to
these
petitioners
which
would
change
the
decision
either
of
the
district
court
or
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is,
that
as
i
appreciate
the
law
--
and
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
--
putting
aside
all
this
talk
about
the
reach
of
the
sherman
act
being
the
same
as
congress'
power
over
interstate
commerce,
the
test
is,
is
it
in
interstate
commerce,
or
does
it
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce?
now,
these
petitioners
have
abandoned
any
contention
that
there,
the
activities
of
these
respondents
occurred
in
interstate
commerce.
they
have
explicitly
done
that
in
their
briefs.
and
they
have
done
it
for
the
same
reason
that
i
had
to
back
down
in
response
to
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
stevens
and
mr.
justice
white
asked
me.
they
couldn't
do
anything
else.
however,
then
the
question
becomes
have
they
shown,
or
can
the
evidence
in
anyway
be
construed
or
resolved
to
show
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce?
and
we
would
submit
that
both
of
the
courts
correctly
resolved
that
issue.
now,
let
me
if
i
may
address
that.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
would
be
somewhat
more
difficult
in
that
case.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
think
that
addresses
the
question
of
substantiality.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
let
me
say,
with
reservations
i
will
agree
to
that.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
well,
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
that
is
--
and
i'm
sorry
not
to
answer
your
question
more
briefly
and
directly
--
is
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
six
percent
commission
on
the
first
$100,000.
it's
a
sliding
scale;
it
goes
down
after
that.
if
the
suggestion
is
that
the
maintenance
of
a
six
percent
rate
on
housing
has
an
effect
on
the
lending
and
the
title
insurance,
i
would
submit
first
that
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
agree
to
that.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
well,
the
way
you
have
stated
it,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
i
would
have
to
say,
yes,
they
might
be.
but
i
would
say
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
well,
let
me
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
think
this
is
a
possibility.
but
what
i
would
strongly
suggest
to
this
court
is,
that
we're
not
dealing
with
possibilities
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
not,
the
commissions,
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
i
would
be
greatly
surprised
if
six
percent
commissions
amounted
to
that
much,
to
millions
of
dollars.
i
don't
know.
it's
conceivable.
but
what
i
would
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
won't
dispute
that,
because
i
don't
know.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
what
i
think
i
said,
and
what
i
would
like
to
say,
is
that
i
would
have
to
accept
the
possibility,
but
i
would
say
that
i
don't
believe
it.
and
what
i
think
is
most
important,
for
purposes
of
this
decision
is,
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect;
none
whatsoever.
now,
if
we
talk
about
the
effect
of
real
estate
commissions
on
the
cost
of
houses,
the
price
of
houses,
certainly
in
the
new
orleans
area
there
has
been
what
i
would
describe
as
a
quantum
leap
in
the
cost
of
residential
houses.
the
level
of
real
estate
commissions
has
not
changed
in
any
respect.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
it
does
in
dollar
amount,
that's
true.
but
where,
then,
is
the
demonstration
that
the
level
of
real
estate
commissions
has
had
any
effect
on
the
price
of
houses?
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
all
right,
sir,
i
won't
ask
for
proof
on
50
percent.
but
at
6
percent,
i
will.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
let
me
say
that
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
it
happened.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
have
i
not
answered
that,
mr.
justice
stewart?
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is,
there's
a
theoretical
possibility
it
could.
but
i'm
not
persuaded
that
it
will.
and
i
think
you
have
a
question
of
how
far
down
can
real
estate
commissions
go?
and
people
stay
in
business.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
and
your
question
is,
how
should
he
resolve
it?
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
should
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that
if
he
gives
the
plaintiff
an
opportunity
to
prove
it,
and
the
plaintiff
doesn't
prove
it,
that
he
is
justified
then
in
resolving
it
adversely
to
him.
let
me
if
i
may
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
well
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
it's
the
only
way
that
i
can
conceive
of
its
doing
so.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
that
is
where
the
record
is
completely
devoid
of
any
proof.
and
if
i
may
continue
on
the
line
suggested
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
activities
of
real
estate
brokers
as
such
are
clearly
intrastate
commerce.
now,
the
suggestion
is
that
you
bridge
the
gap
between
that
intrastate
commerce
and
the,
i
would
say,
undisputed
interstate
commerce
in
lending
and
title
insurance,
is
that
you
accept
as
a
given,
without
any
proof,
that
the
price
of
houses
will,
if
increased
by
maintenance
of
the
percentage
on
real
estate
brokers'
commissions,
and
that
that
in
turn
will
affect
the
number
of
transactions
and
the
amount
of
sales
and
the
amount
--
therefore,
the
amount
bought.
we
say
first,
that
that
is
not
by
any
means
proven.
but
second
--
and
i
think
it
is
important
for
me
to
make
this
point
--
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
an
incidental
effect.
it
is
not
such
an
effect
as
to
contemplated
by
the
line
of
decisions
which
has
been
mentioned
here,
and
i
wish
to
treat
that
particularly.
these
petitioners
rely
heavily
on
mandeville
island.
now,
mandeville
island
was
a
very
special
case,
because
the
whole
process
of
growing
sugar
and
refining
sugar
was
so
closely
integrated
that
this
court
concluded
that
they
were
inseparable.
but
mandeville
island
was
not
the
genesis
of
this
affectation
doctrine.
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
shreveport
rate
cases.
we
have
to
go
back
to
first
and
second
coronado,
we
have
to
go
back
to
apex
hosiery
against
lieder.
and
as
i
appreciate
what
was
held
in
those
cases,
shreveport
rate
held
that
it
was
permissible
for
the
anti-trust
--
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
act
with
respect
to
purely
intrastate
rates
because
they
directly
affected
interstate
rates.
in
first
coronado,
and
in
second
coronado,
what
this
court
held,
as
i
appreciate
it,
is
that
the
activity
of
the
union
in
not
only
calling
a
strike
but
in
the
violence
and
all
of
that
in
first
coronado
was
held
not
to
be
in
interstate
commerce
because
it
was
not
intended
to
affect
interstate
commerce,
nor
was
it
inevitably
--
nor
would
it
inevitably
do
so.
but
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
u.s.
against
--
yes,
they
were
both
criminal
cases;
both
of
them.
but
in
second
coronado,
they
want
back
and
they
took
evidence,
and
the
critical
finding
there
was
that
the
purpose
of
the
strike
was
to
diminish
the
amount
of
coal
which
was
available
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
court
said,
with
that,
we
now
find
that
you
have
a
direct
affect
on
interstate
commerce.
you
have
a
substantial
affect.
now,
when
apex
hosiery
came
along,
you
had
another
strike
(this
was
not
a
criminal
case).
this
was
where
the
strikers
pulled
a
sit-down
strike,
and
they
prevented
the
movement
in
interstate
commerce
of
substantial
amounts
of
hosiery.
and
what
this
court
held
was,
that
that
was
not
a
case
which
affected
interstate
commerce
in
the
sense
required
for
application
of
the
sherman
act.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
you
say
was
that
a
business-type
restraint?
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
sir,
that
was
not
the
basis
of
it.
as
i
appreciate
the
apex
hosiery
opinion,
the
court
made
no
distinction
as
to
whether
it
was
a
labor
dispute
or
an
industrial
dispute
--
an
industrial
restraint.
they
said
that
the
criterion
was
whether
the
object
of
the
restraint
was
on
the
interstate
commerce,
or
whether
it
was
a
--
had
a
purely
local
intention.
i
could
stand
corrected
on
that
but
--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--
i'm
quite
sure
that
that's
what
apex
hosiery
stands
for.
so
that
--
i
see
my
time
is
running
out
--
let
me
just
conclude
by
saying
that
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
criterion
is
is
there
a
real
effect?
mandeville
island
does
not
answer
these
questions.
you
have
to
go
back
of
mandeville
island.
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
origin
of
this
doctrine
of
the
affectation
of
interstate
commerce,
you
will
find
that
the
activities
of
these
respondents,
who
are
clearly
engaged
in
intrastate
commerce,
do
not
meet
the
requisite
test
for
affecting
interstate
commerce
so
as
to
come
within
the
sherman
act.
thank
you.
