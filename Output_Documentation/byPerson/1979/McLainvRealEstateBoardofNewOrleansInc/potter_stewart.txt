justice
potter
stewart
the
depositions
you
introduced
seem
to
me
to
address
primarily
the
theory
of
in-commerce
rather
than
the
effects
upon
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
vinet,
there's
no
indication
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
which
i
just
read
over,
that
your
claim
was
that
you
were
limited
in
your
deposition
to
showing
only
whether
or
not
this
was
in
commerce.
and
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
discusses
at
great
length
both
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
defendants'
activities
were
in
commerce,
and
whether
or
not
their
activities
affected
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no,
i'm
referring
to
my
brother
powell's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
your
grievance
is
that
you
were
limited
in
your
discovery.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
what
was
dealt
with
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
deal--they
talk
about
the
fact
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
price-fixing,
the
fact
that
this
may
be
a
gross
price-fixing
doesn't
affect
the
jurisdictional
question
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know.
but
that's
a
different
subject.
that
subject
is
somewhat
different
from
my
brother
powell's
question.
justice
potter
stewart
my
name
is
stewart.
justice
potter
stewart
technically,
doesn't
a
realtor
earn
his
commission
when
he
brings
a
willing
seller
and
a
willing
buyer
together?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
the
law
in
louisiana?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
still
owed
his
commission,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
easterbrook,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
answer
in
your
colloquy
with
my
brother
rehnquist.
do
you
concede
that
--
logic
aside--the
test
in
the
case--in
a
case
such
as
perez,
i.e.
did
congress
have
constitutional
power
to
enact
this
legislation,
and
that
in
this
particular
case,
if
there
were
generalized
power
on
the
part
of
congress
to
enact
this
legislation,
the
petitioner
perez
cannot
be
heard
to
say,
"well,
i
--
my
loan
was
not
in
interstate
commerce"?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
i
take
it,
the
holding
in
perez
from
which
you
know
i
--
with
which
you
know
i
disagreed.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
different
test
from
the
ordinary,
traditional
under
test
under
the--of
whether
or
not
something
is
in,
or
affects,
interstate
commerce
under
the
anti-trust
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
logic
aside.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yes;
the
two
have
certainly
been
applied
differently.
they've
been
applied
differently
quite
traditionally.
but
that
difference
in
application,
however
the
test
has
been
phrased,
has
never
made
a
difference
in
the
result,
ever
since
the
mandeville
island
farms
case,
which
was
the
first
of
the
cases
holding
squarely
that
the
sherman
act
reaches
transactions
that
affect
commerce,
even
though
they
aren't
in
it.
and
since
the
mandeville
island
farms
case,
that
difference
in
the
phrasing
of
the
test
--
surely
an
important
difference
in
the
phrasing
of
the
test
just
looking
at
words
--
has
never
made
a
difference
in
the
outcome,
at
the
same
time
the
failed
conspiracy
cases
have
been
decided
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
perez
case,
congress
might
have
worded
the
criminal
statute
to
have
said
that
loan-sharking
that
affects
interstate
commerce
shall
be
a
criminal
offense.
and
then
it
would
be
open
to
the
defendant
to
say,
"well,
my
loan-sharking
did
not
--
was
not
in
interstate
commerce,
and
did
not
affect
it."
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
--
that
would
make
it
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
are
in
or
affect?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
some
allegations
of
the
price-fixing?
justice
potter
stewart
well.
i
thought
the
question
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
the
question,
wouldn't
there
necessarily
be
an
effect
on
the
price
of
housing
if
you
had
free
competition
by
contrast
with
a
price-fixed
commission?
that
was
the
question,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
were
talking
about
whether
or
not
a
commission
has
an
effect
on
housing.
of
course
it
does,
on
the
price
of
housing;
we
will
assume
it
does.
but
that
wasn't
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
was
if
there
were
free
competition
among
real
estate
brokers,
and
some
of
them
might
fix
their
rate
at
one
percent
or
two
percent
or
three
percent
or
seven
or
eight
percent,
depending
on
the
individual
house
to
be
sold,
perhaps,
or
their
economies
of
scale,
or
their
efficiencies,
or
whatever,
wouldn't
free
competition,
at
least
arguably,
make
some
housing
cheaper
than
it
is
now
under
a
price-fixed
six
percent
rate?
that
was
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
no
matter
how
egregious
the
violation
might
be
of
the
of
the
anti-trust
laws
if
it
were
affecting
inter-state
commerce,
it's
no
violation
of
federal
--
so
far
as
the
federal
laws
go
if
it
doesn't
affect
interstate
commerce,
or
isn't
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
so
the
first
step
is
to
talk
about
the
price
of
the
house.
and
the
next
question
is,
well,
even
if
the
price
would
go
up
or
go
down
depending
on
whether
there's
an
agreement
or
not,
is
the
mortgage
money
market
affected,
interstate
mortgage
money
market
affected?
or
the
interstate
sale
of
houses
affected?
