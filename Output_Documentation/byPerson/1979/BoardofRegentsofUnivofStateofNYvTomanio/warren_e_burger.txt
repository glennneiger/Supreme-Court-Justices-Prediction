chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
79-424,
board
of
regents
v.
tomanio.
mr.
meserve,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
see
new
asking
for
a
hearing
to
give
the
reasons
for
denial
or
is
she
asking
for
a
hearing
to
give
the
reasons
for
failure
to
give
her
a
waiver?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
did
the
federal
court
order,
a
hearing
on
what
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
whole
focus
or
is
it
more
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
court
of
appeals
expand
what
the
district
court
ordered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
tried
to
get
at
this
before.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here
is
the
court
of
appeals
majority
opinion.
the
adjudicative
fact
to
be
determined
in
considering
whether
to
grant
a
waiver
is
--
and
i
am
omitting
some
--
whether
notwithstanding
her
narrow
failure
of
the
examination,
she
substantially
meets
the
licensure
requirements.
that
is
the
narrow
question.
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
the
six
failures,
it
has
to
do
only
with
whether
she
should
have
had
a
hearing
on
whether
there
should
have
been
a
waiver.
he
went
on
to
say
--
the
opinion
went
on
to
say,
of
course
the
state
legislature
need
not
have
provided
for
any
waiver
of
the
examination
but
once
it
did
so
denial
of
the
waiver
implicates
procedural
due
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
we
have
to
decide
whether
that
is
a
correct
statement,
whether
that
is
correct
or
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
did
that
originate?
where
does
the
waiver
come
from,
from
the
licensing
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
has
said
this
violates
federal
due
process,
if
i
read
their
opinion
correctly.
do
you
read
it
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
the
issue
before
us,
and
that
is
the
only
issue
before
us,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
are
wrong
on
that,
you
prevail,
don't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mutari.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that
this
was
res
judicata,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case,
if
this
court
were
to
decide.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
she
failed
by
five
points?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
just
made
an
analogy
to
the
american
tradition
of
hearings
and
said
as
a
hearing
in
this
court.
do
you
think
you
have
a
constitutional
due
process
right
to
an
oral
argument
and
hearing
in
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
they
have
any
right?
does
anyone
have
any
right
to
an
oral
hearing
in
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
majority
in
some
terms
of
our
cases
are
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
are
decided
without
oral
argument,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
that
do
to
your
claim
that
due
process
requires
a
hearing
in
your
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
they
had
a
rule
that
after
you
had
taken
your
examination
six
times
and
failed
you
could
not
take
it
any
longer,
and
she
failed
six
times,
did
she
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
hypothesis
was
that
in
addition
to
your
existing
statutes
there
was
a
provision
that
five
times
was
the
limit,
as
some
state
licensing
boards
do
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
meserve?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
there
is
nothing
that
was
not
before
the
board
that
could
have
been
brought
before
the
board
except
oral
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
knew
that
she
had
failed
the
examination
six
times.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
knew
that
she
had
been
in
this
activity
for
a
good
number
of
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
would
be
a
reciprocity
type
of
admission.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
