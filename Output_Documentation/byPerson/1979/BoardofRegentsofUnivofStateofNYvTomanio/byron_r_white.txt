mr.
mutari,
before
you
finish,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
make
a
comment
or
two
on
the
statute
of
limitations
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
hardly
been
mentioned
in
oral
argument
by
either
side
and
you
didn't
cite
johnson
v.
railway
express
agency
which
involved
1981
rather
than
1983,
but
i
wondered
generally
your
approach
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
want
to
know
why
it
was
tolled.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
little
while
ago,
didn't
you
indicate
that
you
could
have
come
directly
into
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
we
have
that
very
situation
in
some
eeoc
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
precisely.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
suggest
that
in
the
johnson
v.
railway
express
agency
we
reach
the
opposite
conclusion.
it
is
cited
in
your
opponent's
brief
but
not
in
yours.
