mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
just
step
into
one
part
of
the
recitation
of
the
facts
which
i
think
can
clear
up
what
appears
to
me
to
be
some
sort
of
a
double
kind
of
entendre
we
are
getting
here.
in
the
state
court,
we
argued
a
state
issue
and
in
the
federal
court
we
are
arguing
a
federal
issue.
in
1971,
when
the
legislature
in
its
wisdom
chose
to
pass
a
law
called
7606,
which
was
revision
of
a
law
that
was
on
the
books
since
1939,
they
gave
an
opportunity
to
all
citizens
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
go
to
the
regents
and
request
of
them
a
waiver
of
their
background
requirements
for
license,
of
their
education
requirements
for
a
license,
and
for
the
examination
requirements
in
whole
or
in
part.
previous
to
this
law,
they
had
211
in
which
the
legislature
of
the
new
york
in
its
wisdom
said
that
only
outsiders,
people
who
have
been
practicing
for
five
years
in
a
given
profession
may
come
to
the
state
of
new
york
and
show
the
board
of
regents
that
that
five
years
of
practice
and
what
came
before
it
would
be
sufficient
to
warrant
an
acceptance
by
the
board
of
regents
that
they
substantially
complied.
when
6506
came
around,
it
was
on
the
books
for
five
weeks
before
mary
tomanio
took
advantage
of
it.
it
was
the
first
time
it
was
on
the
books.
they
open
now
this
application
for
showing
whether
they
substantially
complied
or
not
to
citizens
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
to
people
for
the
first
time
who
failed
examinations,
and
it
is
quoted
here
in
clear
english.
now,
that
decision
of
the
board
of
regents
was
an
adjudicative
decision
and
the
process
that
mary
tomanio
used,
going
up
through
the
state
court,
was
one
to
determine
if
that
adjudicative
decision
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes,
she
could
and
a
federal
res
judicata
doctrine
which
is
formulated
by
the
second
circuit
said
has
even
enlarged
the
federal
res
judicata
concept
in
the
new
york
state
res
judicata
concept.
the
federal
court
said
in
monroe
v.
pape
that
you
don't
have
to
go
down
to
the
state
court
first
before
you
bring
your
due
process
or
your
civil
rights
action
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
in
fact
they
are
supporting
the
act
of
congress.
the
act
of
congress
when
they
instituted
the
civil
rights
act,
for
one
simple
reason,
they
were
concerned
that
some
states
might
not
be
able
to
give
some
people
their
rights.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
the
state
res
judicata
is
broader
than
that
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
and
the
new
york
rule
for
res
judicata
is
that
to
say
mary
tomanio
may
not
bring
her
due
process
case,
an
entirely
different
case,
a
constitutional
case,
into
federal
court
if
she
didn't
bring
it
in
the
state
court,
provided
that
the
cause
of
actions
were
the
same,
and
they
quote
winters
v.
lavine
and
misquote
it
by
leaving
out
that
last
sentence,
provided
that
the
cause
of
action
is
the
same.
and
we
contend
that
the
cause
of
action
was
not
the
same.
we
had
apples
in
the
state
court
and
we
had
oranges
in
the
federal
court.
we
had
a
woman
saying
that
when
you
were
given
this
broad
adjudicative
power,
mr.
regents,
you
didn't
use
it
wisely,
you
were
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
it
was
held
by
special
term
that
they
were
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
then
appealed
and
then
the
appeal
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
when
we
came
to
the
federal
court,
we
said
--
judge
foley
--
what
happened,
they
came
down
with
this
decision,
but
the
way
they
arrived
at
it
was
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
whether
it
was
an
arbitrary
decision
or
not
an
arbitrary
decision,
the
way
they
arrived
at
it
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
no,
we
went
on
a
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes,
it
was,
sir.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
no,
it
is
not
the
new
york
rule.
there
is
a
further
sentence
that
says
provided
that
there
is
the
same
cause
of
action
through
both
litigations,
and
we
contend
that
it
was
not
the
same
cause
of
action.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
directly
to
the
supreme
court?
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
we
went
to
the
district
court.
we
went
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
there
were
no
federal
questions
in
the
state
court.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
well,
i
was
thinking
that
maybe
we
could
have
come
in
on
some
kind
of
an
injunction
proceeding
or
something
like
that
against
the
lower
court,
but
we
tried
that
already
because
they
arrested
mary
tomanio
at
one
time
along
the
line
and
we
tried
and
we
couldn't
get
an
injunction.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
we
asked
for
a
hearing
in
1971.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
we
asked
the
board
of
regents
of
the
city
of
new
york.
we
asked
the
board
of
regents
for
a
hearing.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes
--
oh,
when
we
asked
them
for
a
hearing.
we
wrote
them
a
letter
and
asked
them
for
a
waiver,
not
a
hearing.
i'm
awfully
sorry.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
we
never
asked
for
a
hearing
and
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
there
is
no
need
to
ask
that
a
waiver
--
a
hearing
may
be
given
even
although
it
is
not
asked
for
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
it
does
not
have
to
be
given.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
we
think
the
circumstances
are
so
extreme
here
that
it
should
be
given.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
the
extreme
is
that
she
has
been
practicing
chiropractics
since
1958
without
a
blemish,
this
is
her
livelihood,
her
only
source
of
living
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
our
contention
is
that
if
she
failed
107
times
and
she
closely
passed
the
108th
time,
we
are
talking
about
the
one
time
that
she
failed
just
by
six-tenths
of
one
percent.
this
is
the
reasonableness
for
which
we
go
and
ask
for
our
decision.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
don't
think
it
could
be.
though
if
we
put
together
that
she
passed
two
other
state
examinations,
that
she
passed
the
national
chiropractic
board
of
examiners
exam,
which
i
understood
the
state
of
new
york
now
uses
as
a
model,
that
she
practiced
without
a
blemish
since
1958
without
any
mark
against
her,
if
we
had
been
granted
a
hearing,
though
we
did
not
ask
for
a
hearing,
we
could
have
attempted
to
prove
to
that
board
of
regents
these
facts
by
bringing
in
her
peer
group
as
to
her
competency.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
pardon?
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes,
i
was
there,
sir.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
we
asked
them
for
a
waiver
as
the
law
required
and
they
said
no.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
no,
we
didn't
because
the
law
did
not
require
it
or
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
if
we
were
given
a
hearing,
i
believe
that
we
could
have
brought
forward
her
peer
group,
eminent
people
qualified
in
chiropractic
who
would
testify
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
we
were
never
given
a
hearing
to
bring
them.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
they
just
said
no.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
they
said
no
to
me
and
i
said
they
were
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
pardon
me?
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
put
most
of
this
in
a
letter
to
them
when
i
asked
them
for
the
waiver.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
was
never
there.
they
never
let
you
be
there.
you
write
to
them.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
in
the
regents'
home
office,
no.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
submitted
our
arguments.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
written
arguments
and
a
letter
saying
we
would
like
a
waiver
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
--
that
we
feel
we
come
under
6506
subdivision
(5).
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
no,
i
was
not
denied
the
right.
we
had
a
"no"
in
about
48
hours.
and
the
only
logical
path
i
felt
we
could
take
at
that
time
was
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
and
say
they
were
arbitrary
and
capricious,
that
this
decision
was
without
foundation.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
the
reason
we
hold
hearings
here
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
in
other
courts
--
or
we
would
all
be
mailing
letters
to
each
other
--
i
did
give
it
to
them
in
the
form
of
writing,
but
you
have
an
opportunity
to
come
in,
though
i
didn't
ask
for
it,
and
bring
in
witnesses
who
could
or
could
not
impress
the
jury
or
the
set
of
judges
that
were
there,
bring
in
her
patients
who
could
have
attested
to
her
professionalism
and
caring.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
it
is
not
new
york
law.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
6506,
subdivision
(5)
says
that
you
may
waive
examination
requirements.
that
law
came
into
effect
in
1971,
five
weeks
before
she
went
forward
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
that
is
not
so.
it
is
not
the
law.
if
he
can
find
it
there,
fine,
but
it
is
not
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes,
6506,
subdivision
(5),
the
board
of
regents
shall
supervise
the
admission
to
and
the
practice
of
professions.
in
supervising,
the
board
of
regents
may
--
discretionary
--
waive
education,
experience
and
examination
requirements
--
i
editorialize
--
in
whole
or
in
part
for
a
professional
license
prescribed
in
the
article
relating
to
the
profession
provided
the
board
of
regents
shall
be
satisfied
that
the
requirement
of
such
article
have
been
substantially
met.
and
we
hold
here
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
the
examination
requirements.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
exactly.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
no,
i
don't,
but
the
only
reason
we
are
here
is
because
the
board
of
regent's
sought
certiorari
and
you
admitted
us
here.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
no,
sir.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
a
vast
majority.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
the
board
of
regents
is
an
administrative
agency,
the
board
of
agents
should
be
very
close
to
the
people
to
whom
they
are
administering,
they
have
a
responsibility
to
the
state
of
new
york
in
handing
out
these
licenses
and
they
should
be
cognizant
and
sensitive
to
giving
them
to
people
who
have
been
proven
proper
practitioners
for
a
long
time,
and
that
mary
tomanio
has
proven
that
she
is
a
worthwhile
practitioner,
and
that
is
why
i
think
a
hearing
ought
to
have
been
granted
to
her.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
and
if
they
did
have
6506
on
the
books,
i
would
say
she
is
done,
it
is
over.
but
6506
gave
her
that
other
avenue
that
the
legislature
said
that
was
open
to
her.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
would
believe
it
to
be
constitutional,
she
would
have
had
her
due
process,
as
long
as
there
was
nothing
else
on
the
books.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes.
i
must
say
that
we
were
so
sure
that
the
court
would
find
that
this
arbitrary
quick
no
based
on
the
facts
would
never
require
us
going
into
the
federal
courts.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
no,
and
that
if
one
of
the
reasons
we
are
here
in
the
federal
court
now,
because
there
is
such
a
broad
discretionary
power.
it
says
that
the
board
of
regents
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
well,
we
were
really
testing
it.
it
was
only
on
the
books
for
five
weeks
and
we
thought
that
mary
tomanio
had
all
the
qualifications
to
show
that
she
substantially
complied,
and
i
can
recite
them
again,
her
admissions
in
other
states,
passing
the
national
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
the
ordinary
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
it
is
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
board
but
they
must
arrive
at
whatever
decision
they
do
in
a
constitutional
manner,
and
we
are
submitting
to
you
now
that
they
did
not
arrive
at
it.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
well,
they
will
be
wrong
if
their
yes
or
their
no
is
founded
on
a
procedure
that
is
unconstitutional
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
we
are
saying
their
procedure
was
unconstitutional
because
they
gave
no
reasons.
she
had
her
property
and
her
liberty
she
was
taking
to
them
and
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
they
would
be
hearing
her
background,
her
qualifications,
her
long
years
of
practice
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
if
they
did,
then
we
would
have
lost
there
but
we
were
never
given
an
opportunity
and
the
constitutional
decisions
have
held
that
a
person
ought
to
be
given
this
hearing
or
ought
to
be
given
reasons
before
they
come
up
with
their
yes
or
no.
they
come
up
with
their
no
like
with
a
rubber
stamp.
they
came
up
with
their
no
based
on
hearing
nothing.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
believe
the
majority
of
the
standards
--
and
this
is
why
this
is
a
civil
rights
act
--
are
here
in
federal
procedure
and
they
didn't
follow
them.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
would
submit
that
the
cornerstone
of
the
statute
of
limitations
is
the
concept
of
repose.
judge
foley
in
the
district
court
told
that
statute
of
limitations,
which
in
new
york
was
three
years,
believing,
number
one,
that
there
were
no
witnesses
to
forget,
there
was
no
evidence
to
grow
stale;
there
was
only
one
issue,
an
issue
of
law.
mary
tomanio
brought
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
it
was
tolled
in
the
interest
of
federalism,
the
concept
that
a
case
ought
to
be
tried
in
a
state
court
to
its
fullest
before
you
ever
come
to
the
federal
court.
the
federal
court
already
has
an
overcrowded
calendar,
particularly
in
civil
rights
cases.
if
the
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes,
i
could.
i
chose
--
i
had
to
make
a
choice
and
i
made
my
choice
in
the
state
court
and
i
did
make
my
choice
in
the
state
court.
if
i
were
compelled
to
come
to
the
federal
court
and
if
i
didn't
know
that
statutes
could
be
tolled,
it
would
mean
that
a
person
would
go
into
the
state
court
with
his
state
action
and
not
come
to
the
federal
court
and
in
the
middle
of
it
have
to
bring
his
action
in
the
federal
court
and
you
would
have
two
cases
going
at
once
in
new
york
and
here,
as
the
case
before
me,
or
you
would
have
a
person
not
bringing
his
action
at
all
if
he
had
a
civil
rights
matter
and
coming
directly
to
the
federal
court
and
again
congesting
the
calendar.
judge
foley
tolled
it
and
followed
a
policy
of
tolling
so
that
a
person
could
go
safely
to
the
state
court
and
try
to
receive
his
remedies
there
without
coming
to
the
federal
court,
and
then
if
you
--
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
it
is
in
the
interest
of
federalism
that
this
kind
of
tolling
takes
place.
in
the
other
aspects
of
when
they
toll
and
when
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations,
the
court
looks
to
whether
or
not
the
person
was
asleep
at
the
switch,
sleeping
on
their
rights.
she
hadn't.
mr.
vincent
j.
mutari
i
didn't
put
it
in
my
notes,
so
the
case
may
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
so
the
end
of
this,
the
due
process,
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
concept
that
we
had,
a
person
who
had
this
long
practice
unblemished,
who
attempted
to
receive
a
waiver
which
was
granted
and
put
on
the
books
only
five
weeks
before
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
was
refused.
we
contend
that
that
refusal
at
that
time
was
an
adjudicative
decision
that
demanded
some
kind
of
a
hearing.
some
kind
of
a
hearing
was
not
given.
no
reasons
were
given.
and
we
came
to
the
federal
court
because
we
said
this
was
an
unconstitutional
way
to
arrive
at
this
decision
and
we
plead
to
this
court
to
accept
our
arguments.
thank
you.
