justice
john
paul
stevens
what
have
you
got
in
you
hand,
you
have
got
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
got
the
appendix.
is
it
in
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a-5.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
how
do
you
read
that?
is
that
a
state
law
construction
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do,
deny
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
affirmed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
affirmed
that
part
of
the
appellate
division?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals,
the
federal
court
of
appeals
just
ignored
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mutari,
your
theory
about
their
being
arbitrary
and
capricious
as
i
understand
it
was
given
the
facts
that
she
had
almost
passed
the
exam
and
her
history
of
practice
and
the
like,
that
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
given
those
facts
to
deny
her
the
right
to
practice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
didn't
you
have
before
them
substantially
everything
you
would
have
put
in
if
you
had
had
a
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
do
you
respond
to
your
opponent's
argument
that
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law
if
she
fails
the
examination
they
simply
could
not
have
given
her
a
waiver?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
say,
if
i
remember
the
argument,
is
you
may
not
do
that
for
someone
who
has
failed
an
examination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
you
could
have
come
here
directly
from
the
board,
you
could
have
gone
into
federal
court
under
1983
without
ever
going
into
the
state
courts
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
have
gone
and
filed
a
suit
under
1983
when
your
waiver
was
denied
directly,
without
ever
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
doesn't
set
any
standards
for
the
granting
of
the
waiver
and
none
of
the
cases
do,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
expectation
under
state
law
did
you
ever
have
that
a
waiver
would
be
granted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
real
question
is
where
do
you
find
in
state
law
any
limits
on
the
discretion
of
the
board
to
deny
your
request
for
a
waiver?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
like
this
might
be
a
decision
just
left
to
the
complete
discretion
of
the
board.
