justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
have
the
new
york
courts
ever
subjected
a
waiver
decision
to
review?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
would
the
board
have
had
power
to
waive
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
may
be
so
but
that
implies
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
a
waiver
in
these
circumstances
might
not
be
arbitrary.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
are
there
any
standards
supplied
by
the
statute
on
which
waiver
is
to
be
granted?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
was
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
has
the
board
ever
in
any
circumstances
ordered
the
board
to
give
a
waiver
that
the
board
refused?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
doesn't
sound
like
the
court
of
appeals
majority
agreed
with
that
interpretation
of
the
new
york
law,
does
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
court
of
appeals
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
federal
court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
meserve,
i
understood
you
a
moment
ago
to
say
that
in
this
very
case,
in
ringing
language,
some
new
york
court
said
that
there
was
no
waiver
available,
in
these
circumstances.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know,
but
is
it
in
the
appellate
division
opinion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
we
have
that
in
the
petitioner
for
certiorari,
do
we
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
at
page
d-1.
now,
where
in
that
opinion
does
that
appear?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
petition
for
certiorari,
page
d-1.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
you
couldn't
have
come
here,
you
raised
no
federal
question
i
understood
in
the
state
proceeding.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
say
that
the
board
of
regents
did
have
the
authority
to
waive
the
examination
requirement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
it
determined
that
the
new
hampshire
examination
was
substantially
the
equivalent?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
she
argued
that
it
was
the
substantial
equivalent,
it
seems
to
me
to
suggest
that
you
did
have
the
authority
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law
to
grant
the
waiver
you
say
you
didn't
have
the
authority
to.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
she
did
take
what
she
contended
was
an
equivalent
examination
elsewhere,
didn't
she?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
disagreed
with
her,
but
had
you
agreed
with
her
you
would
have
had
the
authority
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law
to
grant
the
waiver.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
i
think
really
your
argument
before
that
you
had
no
authority
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law
really
wasn't
quite
right.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
she
argued
you
should
have
done
in
this
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
it
was
determined,
as
i
understand
the
statement
of
reasons
quoted
on
page
four
of
your
brief,
on
the
ground
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
decided
the
examinations
were
not
substantially
the
equivalent
of
the
new
york
exam.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
would
have
had
discretion
to
rule
otherwise
is
all
i
am
saying.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
all
right.
