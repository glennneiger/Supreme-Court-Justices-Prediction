justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
meserve,
i
notice
that
in
your
brief
you
rely
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
enacted
by
congress,
20
u.s.c.
1738,
saying
that
full
faith
and
credit
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
see
any
treatment
of
that
issue
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
mentioned
in
judge
lombard's
dissent.
did
you
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
you
argue
that
the
broad
new
york
rule
of
estoppel
by
judgment
was
litigated
or
might
have
been
litigated
and
was
barred
in
the
subsequent
new
york
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
my
understanding
of
the
new
york
rule
of
collateral
estoppel
is
that
anything
that
was
litigated
or
might
have
been
litigated
is
barred
in
a
subsequent
lawsuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
contend
in
effect
that
there
was
no
state
interest
which
she
had
under
new
york
law
that
would
have
warranted
a
hearing
as
to
whether
she
should
be
granted
it
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
a
waiver?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
new
york
courts
have
construed
the
statute
relating
to
waivers
so
as
not
to
apply
to
this
type
of
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
it
has
held
that
the
statute
simply
doesn't
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
it
doesn't
apply.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law,
i
take
it,
we
are
bound
by
the
way
the
new
york
courts
have
interpreted
that
particular
statute
as
to
when
a
waiver
may
be
given
and
when
it
may
not
be
given.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
look
at
d-3
-
"had
the
board
waived
the
requirements
on
the
record
here,
it
would
have
abdicated
its
delegated
responsibility."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
highest
court
of
new
york.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
also
the
issue
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
should
have
permitted
this
matter
to
be
relitigated
at
all
after
she
had
had
her
chapter
78
proceeding
in
the
new
york
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
she
could
have
raised
her
constitutional
claims
in
that
proceeding,
couldn't
she?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
second
circuit
bound
by
the
act
of
congress
of
1790,
28
u.s.c.
1738
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
talking
about
the
act
of
1790,
the
third
section,
which
says
with
respect
to
proceedings
in
state
courts,
such
acts,
records
and
judicial
proceedings
shall
have
the
same
full
faith
and
credit
in
every
court
within
the
united
states
and
its
territories
and
possessions
as
they
have
by
law
or
usage
in
the
courts
of
such
state
or
possession.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
doesn't
the
statute
require
the
second
circuit
to
observe
the
new
york
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
new
york
rule
that
not
only
anything
you
actually
litigated
in
that
proceeding
but
anything
that
might
have
been
litigated
cannot
be
relitigated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it
is
left
to
the
complete
discretion
of
the
board,
they
can
go
either
yes
or
no
and
they
will
be
wrong
in
neither
event,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
there
are
no
factors
that
they
have
to
consider,
what
would
they
be
hearing
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
what
you
say
ought
to
entitle
her
to
a
waiver
but
maybe
the
board
just
doesn't
feel
that
any
of
those
are
relevant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
your
answer
to
justice
white's
question
must
be
that
there
are
some
standards
in
new
york
law
because
otherwise
there
would
be
no
reason
for
them
to
come
up
--
why
they
couldn't
simply
say
no,
it
is
a
matter
completely
confined
to
our
discretion
and
we
have
decided
not
to
grant
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
requiring
the
new
york
examination.
