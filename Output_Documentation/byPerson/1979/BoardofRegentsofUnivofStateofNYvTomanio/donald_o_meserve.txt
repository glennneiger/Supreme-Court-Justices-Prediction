mr.
donald
o.
meserve
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
certiorari
raises
really
four
issues,
the
first
being
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
giving
declaratory
judgment,
that
the
board
of
regents
had
violated
mary
tomanio's
civil
rights
by
not
giving
her
a
hearing;
the
second
being
the
extent
to
which
the
district
court
and
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
have
been
bound
by
the
new
york
state
court's
interpretation
of
state
law;
and
the
other
two
being
a
unique
interpretation
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
the
defenses
of
res
judicata
and
the
statute
of
limitations.
since
this
is
a
due
process
case,
i
think
it
is
important
to
start
with
a
brief
outline
of
the
essential
facts
to
which
that
due
process
has
got
to
be
applied.
mary
tomanio
practiced
chiropractic
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
a
few
years
before
the
first
chiropractic
licensing
statute
was
enacted,
effective
in
july
1963.
when
that
statute
came
into
effect,
it
provided
a
special
means
of
qualification
for
what
were
called
grandfather
applicants
which
was
intended
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
they
had
been
out
of
school
for
a
while
and
that
they
had
been
acquiring
valuable
experience
through
actual
practice.
a
limited
series
of
four
special
examinations
was
provided
for
the
grandfather
applicants.
at
the
time
the
class
action
was
brought
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
the
licensing
statute,
wasmuth
v.
allen,
cited
in
our
brief,
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
statute
and
the
appeal
to
this
court
was
dismissed.
subsequently,
the
four
examinations
originally
contemplated
were
extended
to
five
and
then
to
six
special
examinations.
mrs.
tomanio
had
made
her
application
in
the
normal
source
of
events
for
licensure,
was
admitted
to
the
series
of
special
examinations,
took
and
failed
all
six
of
them.
as
a
result
of
retaining
credit
for
subjects
passed
in
previous
exams
and
as
a
result
of
grade
averaging
within
a
group
of
subjects,
her
final
margin
of
failure
on
the
sixth
and
last
examination
was
six-tenths
of
one
point.
at
this
point,
it
is
our
contention
that
she
had
failed
to
qualify
under
a
valid
and
constitutional
licensing
scheme
and
at
this
point
if
there
were
no
move
new
york
statutes
involved,
the
circuit
court
would
have
agreed
that
her
previous
right
to
practice
chiropractic
had
expired
by
the
result
of
her
failure
on
the
examinations.
however,
in
new
york
we
have
an
article
of
omnibus
provisions
which
apply
to
all
of
the
thirty
professions
licensed
by
the
board
of
regents.
these
are
in
addition
to
the
special
provisions
set
forth
in
the
separate
article
for
each
of
the
professions.
one
of
the
omnibus
provisions
which
has
been
in
effect
for
many
years
provides
that
the
board
of
regents
may
waive
a
specific
licensing
requirement
if
they
are
satisfied
that
it
has
been
substantially
met.
after
failing
the
examination
route
under
the
chiropractic
article,
after
failing
the
examination
rule
under
the
chiropractic
article,
dr.
tomanio
applied
for
a
waiver
of
her
failure
on
the
examinations.
this
was
denied
by
the
department,
and
that
was
in
november
of
1971.
she
subsequently
instituted
a
state
court
action
contending
that
the
denial
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
that
the
statute
required
the
regents
to
consider
her
failure
and
her
narrow
margin
of
failure
on
the
examination
and
her
licensure
in
two
other
states.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
at
special
term
granted
judgment
from
the
bench
for
mrs.
tomanio.
no
decision
was
written.
the
board
of
regents
appealed
and
that
judgment
was
unanimously
reversed
by
the
appellate
division.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
unanimously
dismissed.
so
that
all
of
the
i
believe
11
appellate
judges
in
the
state
of
new
york
dismissed
her
action.
so
then
in
june
of
1976
she
initiated
an
action
in
the
district
court
in
which
she
requested
a
mandatory
order
directing
licensure,
an
injunction
against
interference
with
her
right
to
practice,
and
a
declaration
that
her
civil
rights
had
been
violated.
the
first
two
elements
of
relief,
the
real
relief
which
she
requested,
namely
licensure
and
the
right
to
practice
were
identical
to
those
which
had
been
raised
in
the
state
case.
there
had
been
no
mention
of
section
1983
or
federal
civil
rights
in
the
prior
state
court
actions.
the
federal
district
court
denied
the
request
for
licensure,
denied
the
request
for
an
injunction
against
interference
with
her
practice,
but
did
give
judgment
that
the
board
of
regents
had
violated
her
civil
rights
through
the
failure
to
offer
her
a
hearing
on
her
application
for
a
waiver
of
the
examination
failures
and
in
failing
to
give
her
the
reasons
for
the
denial
of
her
application.
the
petitioner
appealed
from
that
decision,
no
cross-appeal
was
filed,
and
the
licensure
and
practice
issue
therefore
are
not
before
the
court.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
in
substance
but
not
by
name,
your
honor.
i
did
not
refer
to
that
section.
i
did
argue
that
the
state
courts
had
resolved
that
issue.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes,
we
did
make
that
argument.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
due
process,
this
was
first
raised
of
course
in
the
federal
action
four
years
after
the
final
determination.
in
the
letter
of
november
1971
notifying
mrs.
tomanio
of
the
denial
of
her
waiver
application,
and
incidentally
notifying
her
that
she
was
admitted
to
the
regular
licensing
examination,
she
was
informed
that
if
she
had
any
questions
she
could
contact
the
executive
secretary.
the
letter
did
not
go
on
at
that
time
to
give
written
reasons
for
the
denial
of
the
application.
however,
three
months
later,
in
february
1972,
in
our
first
response
to
the
state
court
litigation,
those
reasons
were
given
in
writing
and
in
full,
therefore
she
had
notice
of
the
reasons
for
the
denial
of
her
application
in
writing
over
four
years
before
the
institution
of
this
federal
action.
and
i
would
submit
that
that
issue
really
is
and
was
academic
four
years
before
the
case
began.
furthermore,
this
is
not
a
type
of
a
case
where
the
board
of
regents
was
doing
something
to
mary
tomanio,
but
a
case
where
she
had
failed
to
qualify
under
the
statute
regulating
her
profession
and
then
applied
arguing
that
she
had
the
substantial
equivalent
of
the
statutory
requirements.
that
application
was
judged
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
material
which
she
submitted
and
which
was
accepted
at
face
value.
she
knew
the
basis
of
her
argument
and
she
was
represented
by
an
attorney
from
the
beginning
of
the
application
to
the
department,
i
believe,
and
there
is
really
no
question
that
she
had
had
reasons
for
denial
of
her
application
from
the
beginning
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
hearing,
the
federal
district
court
judge
and
the
majority
of
the
circuit
court
held
that
she
should
have
been
given
a
formal
hearing
on
her
application
for
waiver.
now,
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
such,
no
hearing
was
requested
by
her
at
any
time
although
she
was
represented
by
an
attorney
throughout,
and
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
had
not
yet
decided
roth
and
sinderman.
so
we
are
being
hit
with
a
bit
of
a
lack
of
anticipation
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
when
you
put
this
into
the
perspective
of
1971
when
the
decision
was
made.
secondly,
any
right
to
practice
which
she
may
have
had
had
been
terminated
in
our
opinion
by
her
failure
to
qualify
by
passing
one
of
the
series
of
special
examinations.
she
had
no
reasonable
expectation,
much
less
a
mutual
expectation
that
the
state
would
waive
a
requirement
if
she
proved
unable
to
meet
it.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
subsequent
application
under
those
circumstances
continued
a
right
or
should
have
been
construed
as
having
reinstated
the
right
really
for
purposes
of
considering
the
due
process
to
which
she
was
entitled
on
the
second
application.
i
think
the
court
below
erred
in
lumping
the
original
licensing
application
and
the
waiver
application
together.
we
would
also
argue
that
she
had
in
effect
due
process.
as
i
said
before,
she
was
represented
by
an
attorney
in
the
waiver
application,
she
had
a
full
opportunity
to
present
her
arguments
in
writing
and
she
had
to
and
they
were
simply
that
she
had
almost
passed,
she
was
licensed
in
two
other
states,
a
standard
which
we
did
not
regard
as
equivalent,
and
she
had
passed
a
private
licensing
examination
which
the
state
also
did
not
accept
as
equivalent.
she
was
given
eventually
the
reasons
for
denial
and
she
had
a
fully
adequate
record
for
judicial
review
which
is
proven
by
the
fact
that
it
was
in
fact
reviewed,
and
the
state
courts
found
that
she
did
not
have
the
substantial
equivalent.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i
think
she
is
now
belatedly
asking
that
we
give
her
a
hearing
on
her
1971
application
and
start
all
over
again,
followed
i
suspect
by
three
more
state
courts
and
three
more
federal
courts.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
the
district
court
decision
merely
said
that
we
should
have
given
her
a
hearing.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
on
her
application
for
a
waiver,
on
her
argument
that
she
had
the
substantial
equivalent
of
the
new
york
requirements.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i
think
it
is
more
than
that.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
no,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
appellate
division
decided
that
--
this
was
argued
before
them,
there
is
no
question
about
this
--
that
the
evidence
that
she
had
submitted
on
her
application
was
not
the
substantial
equivalent,
and
also,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
under
which
she
applied
did
not
apply
to
this
type
of
an
application.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
never.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
no.
in
fact,
the
argument
made
in
the
petition
with
the
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i
don't
know
that
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
the
argument
made
in
the
complaint
in
the
district
court
was
not
that
she
wanted
a
hearing
but
that
because
she
had
never
been
given
a
hearing
the
district
court
should
give
her
a
license.
now,
we
believe
the
court
below
erred
in
ignoring
the
new
york
interpretation
of
its
own
statute.
section
6506
of
the
education
law,
this
substantial
equivalent
section,
is
as
i
said
before
an
omnibus
provision
which
has
been
on
the
books
for
many
years.
it
has
never
been
applied
by
the
board
of
regents
or
by
the
new
york
courts
to
an
application
for
a
waiver
of
a
provision
which
has
been
failed
--
an
examination
which
has
been
failed.
it
is
a
necessary
type
of
statute
authorizing
waiver
of
experience
or
examination
or
preliminary
education
requirements
for
candidates
who
have
the
substantial
equivalent
of
the
new
york
rule
but
as
it
is
applied
to
candidates
who
have
acquired
their
education
or
taken
their
examination
in
some
jurisdiction
where
it
differs
from
that
given
in
new
york
but
is
substantially
equivalent
thereto.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case,
in
either
state
or
federal
court,
indicating
that
new
york
has
ever
applied
this
statute
to
the
type
of
a
situation
we
have
here.
we
contend
it
was
never
intended
to
be,
it
never
should
have
been,
and
we
contend
that
the
majority
in
the
circuit
court
erred
in
ignoring
that
new
york
interpretation
of
its
own
statutes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
no,
we
contend
that
the
statute
was
never
intended
to
apply
to
this.
but
beyond
that,
we
would
say
she
certainly
--
the
best
she
had
was
a
mere
hope
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
--
of
a
waiver.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
it
has
never
been
applied
to
this
type
of
situation.
it
used
to
be
that
the
statute
explicitly
referred
to
foreign
applicants.
there
was
a
general
recodification
in
1971
of
all
of
the
new
york
statutes
relating
to
professional
licensing,
and
the
present
provision
no
longer
contains
an
implicit
restriction
to
out-of-state
applicants.
but
the
interpretation
placed
upon
it
by
the
department
and
by
the
appellate
division
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
the
same
as
the
interpretation
placed
upon
the
former
section
and
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
mrs.
tomanio's
state
court
action
cited
matter
of
erlanger
which
was
the
leading
new
york
case
under
the
former
statute
and
which
set
forth
at
great
length
the
concept
that
this
was
an
extraordinary
provision
not
to
be
applied
lightly.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes,
we
have
had
a
number
of
cases
in
new
york
involving
applications
for
waiver,
not
waiver
of
an
examination
that
has
been
failed.
that
has
not
even
been
tried.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
no.
the
decision
of
the
appellate
division
in
the
new
york
courts
held,
and
it
is
cited
in
the
dissenting
opinion
from
the
circuit
court,
and
it
states
in
ringing
language
that
it
would
have
been
arbitrary
and
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
board
of
regents
to
have
granted
this
request.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i
couldn't
agree
in
these
circumstances.
there
are
other
circumstances
that
are
appropriate
for
a
waiver,
many
of
them.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
not
in
the
statute,
no.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
appellate
division
said
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
but
you
cannot
waive
an
examination
that
has
been
failed.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i
can't
recall
one
offhand,
but
i
suspect
that
they
probably
have.
we
have
a
fair
volume
of
litigation
in
professional
licensing
cases,
none
however
relating
to
an
examination
requirement.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
it
doesn't
apply.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
it
was
not
intended
as
an
end-run
whereby
somebody
who
can't
pass
an
examination
can
get
around
it.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i
think
they
did.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes
--
oh,
no,
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
am
thinking
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
oh,
no,
they
ignored
it,
and
this
is
my
argument.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
no,
my
argument
is
that
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
because
the
new
york
state
legislature
did
not
provide
for
the
waiver
of
an
examination
that
has
been
failed.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
the
waiver
comes
--
the
waiver
statute
is
general,
it
can
apply
to
any
profession,
it
can
apply
to
any
requirement.
it
says
the
board
of
regents
may
waive
a
requirement
if
in
their
judgment
it
has
been
substantially
met.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
right.
in
the
courts
and
in
practice
in
the
administrative
body,
it
has
never
been
applied
and
the
new
york
courts
i
think
have
held
fairly
that
it
was
never
intended
to
be
applied
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
they
said
that
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes,
that
is
in
this
case.
it
is
quoted
by
justice
lombard
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
it
is
the
appellate
division
of
the
new
york
state
courts
in
her
state
court
action.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes,
you
have
it
in
the
appendix,
too.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
what
are
you
in,
your
honor?
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i've
got
the
appendix.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes,
a-5.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
that
is
the
language
i
have
in
my
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes,
i
read
that
as
a
construction
by
the
new
york
appellate
courts
that
section
6506
under
which
a
waiver
application
was
made
could
not
be
applied
to
this
situation.
i
read
it
as
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
--
state
law,
the
application
had
to
be
denied.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
affirmed.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes,
the
appellate
division
decision.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i
apologize.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
they
looked
at
the
language
of
the
statute
and
nothing
more
and
held
that
a
hearing
should
have
been
required.
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
no,
it
is
not
the
only
issue,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
is
one
of
the
issues
certainly.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i
hope
so.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
i
do
not
have
the
time.
i
want
to
reserve
a
few
moments
and
i
am
almost
out
of
time.
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
have
briefed
the
point
of
the
unique
second
circuit
rules
on
the
statute
of
limitations
and
res
judicata,
and
i
think
that
as
they
have
been
applied
in
this
case,
they
do
not
do
substantial
--
they
are
not
in
the
sound
interest
of
the
administration
of
justice
because
they
encourage
an
administrative
determination
followed
by
three
cases
in
the
state
court,
followed
by
three
federal
courts
and
prolong
what
should
be
a
fairly
straight-forward
determination
through
nine
years
of
litigation.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
that
was
never
alleged.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
you
could
raise
that
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
it
could
be
raised,
absolutely,
article
78
proceedings
in
a
state
court
or
through
a
federal
action.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
to
sum
up
very
quickly
a
couple
of
things.
the
statute
of
limitations
and
res
judicata
arguments
sort
of
highlight,
are
highlighted
here
by
the
fact
that
we
are
urging
to
remember
what
happened
nine
years
ago
when
the
application
for
a
waiver
was
made.
the
application
was
made
upon
three
letters
and
supporting
affidavits
submitted
by
mr.
mutari
which
are
in
the
record
in
the
circuit
court.
he
was
permitted
to
submit
whatever
he
wanted
to.
there
was
no
cutoff
at
that
time.
there
was
no
request
for
a
further
submission
of
any
kind.
now,
on
the
question
of
standards
on
this
waiver
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
right.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
not
too
many
at
that
time,
two
to
five,
i
think,
but
she
has
been
going
on.
yes,
there
was
nothing
else
and
on
what
he
submitted
the
new
york
courts
held
that
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
grant
it,
the
statute
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
that.
now,
the
statute
does
have
standards
built
right
into
it.
those
words
"substantially
met"
have
a
meaning.
almost
passing
an
examination
is
not
quite
the
same
as
substantially
meeting
an
examination
requirement
in
our
interpretation.
somebody
who
takes
an
examination
somewhere
else
which
may
not
be
quite
the
same
as
ours
could
be
admitted
under
that
provision
on
a
determination
that
they
substantially
met
the
examination
requirement.
somebody
who
almost
passes
an
examination
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
no,
they
had
the
authority
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
right.
they
did
not
have
the
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
we
have
the
authority
to
waive
an
examination
requirement
if
we
believe
that
it
has
been
substantially
been
met.
we
never
believe
that
where
the
examination
was
a
new
york
examination
and
was
failed.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
we
may
believe
that
if
an
equivalent
examination
is
taken
somewhere
else.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes,
and
that
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
i
think
it
was
right
if
you
coupled
her
failure
and
her
out-of-state
examination.
if
she
came
in
with
an
out-of-state
examination
which
was
an
equivalent
of
the
new
york
examination,
we
had
the
authority
to
license
her.
if
she
had
her
--
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
without
requiring
the
new
york
exam.
we
could
accept
the
foreign
exam,
determining
it
to
be
the
substantial
equivalent.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
and
she
argued
that
in
the
state
courts
and
that
was
one
of
the
issues
which
was
specifically
argued
and
determined
against
her
in
the
state
court.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
her
foreign
examination.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
yes.
mr.
donald
o.
meserve
on
the
statute
of
limitations
and
on
res
judicata
argument,
the
rule
in
the
second
circuit
is
contrary
to
the
generally
accepted
rules
and
we
believe
the
interests
of
justice
would
require
a
uniform
rule
in
that
respect.
thank
you.
