justice
thurgood
marshall
and
counsel
never
asked
for
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
she
never
did
ask
for
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
it
true
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
granted
if
it
had
been
asked
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
know,
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
ask
one
question.
how
do
you
raise
the
problem
that
my
examination
was
erroneously
graded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
say
how
would
you
raise
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
could
be
raised?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
could
be
raised?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
didn't
appeal
to
the
higher
court,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
the
state
court
proceeding
was
over
when
you
went
to
the
district
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
when
the
court
of
appeals
ruled,
you
could
have
come
here,
couldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
you
could
have
come
to
this
court.
so
instead
of
that
you
appealed
to
the
district
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
you
come
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
you
ask
for
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
record?
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
never
did
ask
for
a
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
does
it
have
to
be
given?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
should
it
be
given
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
extreme,
that
she
failed
seven
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
she
failed
seven
times.
justice
thurgood
marshall
weren't
you
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
weren't
you
there?
wasn't
the
lawyer
present?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
you
offer
to
put
on
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
offer
to
put
on
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
had
been
given
a
hearing,
what
would
you
have
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
you
bring
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
they
tell
you
you
couldn't
bring
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said
no
to
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
they
listened
to
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
listen
to
you?
did
they
cut
you
off?
did
you
say
anything
you
wanted
to
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
when
you
were
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
were
never
present?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
submit
affidavits?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
submitted
oral
arguments?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
submitted
written
arguments?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
offer
to
submit
the
affidavits
of
these
people
you
were
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
you
denied
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
say
specifically
that
you
can
waive
the
examination
requirement
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
waive
the
examination,
couldn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
waive
the
examination,
couldn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
waive
the
whole
examination,
couldn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
think
that
is
what
it
means?
