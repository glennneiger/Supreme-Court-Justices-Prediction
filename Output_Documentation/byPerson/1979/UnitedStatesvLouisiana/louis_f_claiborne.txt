mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
part
--
i
wish
i
could
say
the
last
part
--
of
the
final
chapter
in
the
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
louisiana
over
the
mineral
resources
of
the
continental
shelf
off
the
coast
of
that
state,
a
controversy
which
has
been
before
this
court
since
1948.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
louisiana's
more
extravagant
claims
to
parts
of
that
continental
shelf
were
rejected
and
its
was
settled
that
louisiana
was
entitled
only
to
a
three-mile
belt
measured
from
its
coast
in
the
usual
way.
finally,
in
1975,
the
louisiana
coastline,
that
is
to
say
the
base
line
from
which
that
three-mile
belt
is
measured
was
fixed
by
decree
entered
by
this
court
on
june
16th.
that
decree
was
jointly
submitted
by
the
parties
and
entered
by
consent.
i
immediately
stress
that
that
decree,
in
defining
the
areas
that
were
federal
and
those
which
were
state,
expressly
provided
that
the
coastline
defined
in
it
was
to
be
taken
as
the
past
and
present
coastline
for
all
relevant
times
and
purposes.
that
is
to
say
that
true
or
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
coastline
was
treated
as
having
been
unchanged
and
the
portions
attributable
to
the
federal
and
state
government
unchanged
since
june
5,
1950,
the
accounting
date,
the
earliest
relevant
date,
with
only
three
exceptions
which
fortunately
do
not
concern
us
here.
in
three
areas,
the
court
approved
the
master's
finding
that
for
some
periods
islands
or
extensions
of
the
mainland
had
existed
whereas
for
others
they
have
not.
the
relevance
of
this
is
that
all
the
accounting
in
this
case
have
been
based
on
that
premise,
that
is
that
the
coastline
has
not
changed
in
thirty
years.
now,
although
the
three-mile
line
extending
from
the
coastline
has
not
formally
been
entered
by
decree
here,
the
parties
within
a
month
of
the
court's
last
decision,
the
decree
of
june
16,
1975,
agreed
to
that
line
simply
as
a
matter
of
mathematical
projection,
and
that
description
has
been
submitted
to
the
special
master
and
is
before
the
court
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
parties
with
respect
to
it.
what
remains
are
purely
accounting
issues,
not
boundary
questions.
we
are
done
with
geography.
we
are
now
quarreling
about
money,
that
is
to
say
the
monetary
consequences
of
the
boundary
determinations.
we
had
hoped
that
no
such
issue
would
remain
for
this
court
and
indeed
it
did
not
appear
that
there
was
any
disagreement
between
the
parties
until
1975
when
for
the
first
time
louisiana
made
the
claims
which
this
court
referred
to
its
special
master
on
which
he
wrote
a
report
and
which
are
now
before
this
court
on
exceptions
to
that
report.
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
if
it
accepts
our
acquiescence
in
one
of
the
rulings
of
the
special
master
adverse
to
the
united
states
with
respect
to
severance
tax,
which
we
do
not
press
here,
that
leaves
two
issues.
the
first
issue
is
simply
put
whether
louisiana
must
pay
over
to
the
united
states
subject
to
appropriate
offsets
the
oil
and
gas
revenues
which
it
collected
from
lessees
since
june
1950
and
which
are
attributable
to
federal
areas
of
the
continental
shelf,
just
as
the
united
states
must
pay,
for
the
most
part
has
paid
to
louisiana
the
receipts
from
the
same
date
attributable
to
state
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
approximately
$19
million.
louisiana
says
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
so
we
thought.
in
fact,
it
involves
portions,
monies
from
zone
2
as
well,
approximately
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
issue
with
respect
to
zone
4
because
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
would
have
been
had
louisiana
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
though
they
would
have
been
more
extravagant
than
louisiana
ever
put
forward
because
zone
4
was
defined
as
that
area
which
louisiana
did
not
by
its
most
extravagant
claims
assert.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
now,
louisiana
says
it
will
keep
all
of
this
money
attributable
to
federal
lands
since
1950,
and
the
special
master
agreed
with
the
state.
we
have
accordingly
filed
an
exception
here.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
united
states
must
pay
interest
or
some
like
sum
in
respect
of
the
monies
attributable
to
state
lands
which
were
"impounded"
in
the
federal
treasury
until
they
were
paid
over
to
louisiana
in
mid-1975.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
were
paid
over
without
interest.
there
is
no
complaint
that
we
did
not
dislodge
all
of
the
monies
actually
received
from
state
lands,
with
some
exceptions
which
involve
complex
accounting
problems
for
split
leases
which
the
decree
permitted
to
be
deferred.
there
is
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
had
paid
over
to
louisiana
to
date
$141
million.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
interest
on
that
by
one
computation
put
by
louisiana
would
be
approximately
$88
million.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
master
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry.
it
is
exactly
as
you
said,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
master
held
with
louisiana
on
its
claim
to
retain
what
we
call
the
federal
monies
from
zone
1
and
partially
zone
2.
he
held
with
the
united
states
in
that
he
rejected
louisiana's
claim
to
interest
on
the
impounded
funds
which
we
for
the
most
part
have
long
since
paid
over.
now,
i
shall
address
both
issues
but,
being
the
except
all
with
respect
to
the
federal
monies
louisiana
retains,
i
shall
concentrate
my
argument
there.
as
i
have
indicated,
some
$19
million
are
involved.
it
has
been
called
the
zone
1
issue
and
so
it
seemed
at
first,
but
later
--
and
i
may
say
after
the
accounting
filed
in
in
this
court
and
in
the
proceedings
before
the
special
master
and
in
some
cases
only
in
the
last
two
or
three
years,
reference
having
been
five
years
ago,
louisiana
has
changed
its
position
somewhat
and
is
now
resisting,
as
we
understand
them
--
the
attorney
general
can
correct
correct
me
--
resisting
paying
any
of
the
monies
collected
by
the
state
from
federal
submerged
lands
in
any
zone
for
any
period,
including
the
last
five
years,
and
indeed
including
until
such
time
as
this
court
enters
a
further
decree.
now,
it
is
unfortunately
necessary
to
explain
what
zone
1
is.
by
1956,
both
the
united
states
and
the
state
were
granting
leases,
conflicting
leases
in
the
area
which
louisiana
claimed
to
be
its
submerged
land
under
the
act
passed
three
years
earlier.
louisiana
sought
injunctions
and
obtained
injunctions
in
its
own
state
courts.
we
had
by
this
time
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
renew
the
case
in
this
court
which
had
been
granted
and
accordingly
we
applied
here.
this
court,
on
the
application
of
the
united
states,
enjoined
both
parties
from
granting
any
new
leases
and
their
lessees
from
drilling
any
further
wells.
that
situation
produced
the
so-called
interim
agreement
of
1956.
that
agreement
divided
the
continental
shelf
into
the
four
zones.
zone
1,
with
which
we
are
primarily
concerned,
is
the
area
three
miles
wide
and
nearest
the
louisiana
coast.
it
was
fixed
on
a
rough
--
and
i
emphasize
rough
--
approximation
of
the
area
which
the
united
states
then
believed
under
then
principles,
since
changed,
had
been
granted
by
the
submerged
lands
act
to
louisiana.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
so
it
seemed,
but
louisiana
now
makes
a
wholly
different
argument
nonetheless
dependent
on
the
interim
agreement
which
is
that
though
they
received
the
money
they
never
really
leased
our
lands
because
the
lease
descriptions
were
such
that
impliedly
they
were
telling
the
lessee
you
drill
or
occupy
federal
lands
at
your
own
risk,
an
argument
with
which
i
will
deal
but
which
is
the
latest
of
louisiana
positions.
now,
this
court
has
already
clearly
held
that
neither
party
was
bound
by
the
zone
1
line
and
indeed
it
is
because
of
that
holding
that
the
major
part
of
the
present
controversy
arises,
because
the
united
states
was
adjudicated
to
be
the
true
owner
of
lands
within
zone
1.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
was
entitled
under
this
court's
decision
to
the
lands
seaward
of
that
zone.
so
the
zone
1
line
and
the
true
boundary
line
do
not
coincide.
one
more
word
about
the
interim
agreement
at
this
point.
that
agreement
did
provide
louisiana's
primary
reliance
on
this
fact,
that
louisiana
would
have
exclusive
administrative
control
in
that
zone,
and
it
was
not
provided
that
the
revenues
derived
from
its
leases
there
need
be
impounded;
whereas,
in
zones
2
and
3
in
practice
administered
by
the
united
states,
those
revenues
must
be
impounded
against
the
day
when
the
true
ownership
was
decided.
in
zone
4,
as
i
have
already
indicated
beyond
any
louisiana
claim,
the
united
states
was
free
to
grant
leases
and
had
no
obligation
to
impound.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
because,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
was
recognized
and
largely
correctly
that
most
of
zone
1
would
in
any
event
go
to
louisiana
even
though
it
was
known
then
that
the
boundary
was
not
accurate.
louisiana
asked
and
the
united
states
agreed
to
allow
it
to
enjoy
some
of
the
revenues
from
this
area
and
therefore
since
most
of
those
revenues
would
in
any
event
remain
with
louisiana,
it
seemed
right
and
fair
to
permit
louisiana
to
enjoy
those
revenues
without
a
duty
to
impound.
it
would,
however,
have
been
nonsense
and
most
improvident
for
the
united
states
to
have
agreed
to
waive
all
its
claims
to
revenue
there
without
waiving
its
claim
to
title.
and
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
there
was
no
way
for
a
title,
indeed
title
has
been
adjudicated
there,
because,
after
all,
this
case
was
primarily
one
about
mineral
revenues,
not
about
abstract
title.
it
would
have
permitted,
as
louisiana
says
it
did
permit,
louisiana
largely
to
drain
the
area
and
to
return
to
us
twenty
years
later
or
perhaps
twenty-five
years
later
an
empty
title,
the
oil
and
gas
drained
from
it.
that
is
precisely
what
louisiana
says
we
agreed
to.
why
we
should
have
done
so
is
hard
to
fathom.
now,
i
have
indicated
that
louisiana's
resistant
to
our
claim
is
in
respect
to
zone
1
monies
between
the
date
of
the
agreement,
october
1956,
and
the
date
on
which
it
ended
for
this
purpose,
june
1975.
but
they
are
not
satisfied
to
resist
only
those
claims,
they
also
resist
the
claim
for
some
$3.3
million
derived
from
zone
2
which
is
in
no
way
committed
to
them
by
the
agreement.
they
also
resist
a
claim
to
an
additional
$500,000
derived
before
the
agreement
was
entered
into
from
zone
1,
and
they
also
resist
a
claim
to
any
amounts
since
this
court's
degree
fixing
the
boundary,
in
june
1975.
now,
the
basic
question
is
why
shouldn't
louisiana
be
required
to
pay
over
the
monies
derived
from
federal
lands,
just
as
the
united
states
is
required
to
do
likewise
with
respect
to
state
lands.
ever
since
1950,
the
rule
of
the
case
has
been
that
the
owner
of
the
lands
is
entitled
to
the
revenues,
regardless
of
who
first
received
them.
that
obligation
has
been
deferred
over
and
over
again
but
it
has
never
been
varied.
the
special
master
himself
said
this
would
certainly
be
the
case
in
the
absence
of
any
adjudication
or
agreement
between
the
parties
to
the
contrary,
and
we
entirely
endorse
that
statement.
so
we
look
to
see
whether
there
was
a
ruling
by
this
court
which
authorizes
the
exception
from
what
had
otherwise
been
the
law
of
the
case,
and
we
find
everything
to
the
contrary.
in
1950,
this
court
established
the
basic
rule.
each
party
must
account
since
june
5,
1950,
the
date
on
which
this
court's
decision
in
the
louisiana
case
was
entered.
that
was
forgiven
for
the
first
three
miles
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
but
in
1960,
this
court
made
clear
that
that
was
the
extent
of
the
waiver.
in
1960,
seven
years
after
the
submerged
lands
act,
and
four
years
after
the
'56
agreement,
and
yet
louisiana
consented
to
the
entry
of
a
decree
which
explicitly
requires
it
to
account
and
pay
over
eventually
all
sums
derived
from
federal
lands
with
no
exception
for
zone
1.
in
1965,
a
supplemental
decree
followed
the
same
formula
and,
most
importantly,
in
the
most
recent
decree,
in
1975,
the
court
entered
by
consent
a
decree
expressly
requiring
louisiana
to
account
for
unimpounded
monies
since
june
1950
derived
from
federal
lands.
louisiana
admits
that
that
is
the
money
we
are
talking
about,
but
they
say
the
accounting
is
for
information
only.
why
it
should
have
undertaken
or
the
court
should
have
burdened
it
with
the
not
inconsiderable
task
of
computing
receipts
for
thirty
years
if
nothing
were
to
turn
on
it
escapes
us.
there
is
paragraph
13
of
the
decree
which
says
that
the
interim
agreement
remains
in
effect
to
the
extent
not
inconsistent
with
the
decree,
but
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
decree
requiring
accounting
and
payment
if
the
interim
agreement
provided
otherwise.
it
does
not.
it
was
not
then
understood
to
do
so.
when
that
decree
was
entered,
it
must
be
clear
that
all
parties
believed
the
accounting
obligation
had
finally
come
to
fruition.
now,
when
we
look
at
the
agreement
itself,
we
derive
no
different
conclusion.
of
course,
the
agreement
can't
possibly
excuse
the
failure
to
pay
monies
in
zone
2
or
monies
derived
before
the
agreement
was
ever
entered
into,
even
though
those
were
resisted
presumably
on
other
grounds.
but
as
to
the
'56
and
'75
monies,
the
text
of
the
agreement
is
very
clear
that
there
is
no
waiver
of
any
rights.
it
is
a
working
agreement.
it
is
a
modus
vivendi.
it
was
deliberately
tailored
so
as
to
avoid
either
parties
giving
up
anything
permanently.
louisiana
could
administer,
louisiana
could
enjoy
for
the
time
being
revenues
and
nothing
more.
as
i
have
already
indicated,
it
would
not
have
made
sense
for
us
to
retain
our
claim
to
title
in
this
area
and
waive
our
right
to
revenues
in
the
area
at
the
same
time.
that
would
have
been
nothing
more
than
an
incentive
for
delay.
nor
did
either
party
so
understand
the
agreement
as
louisiana
now
maintains
if
we
look
at
how
they
behaved
afterwards.
louisiana
repeatedly
consented
to
the
entry
of
decrees
which
strictly
speaking
foreclosed
its
argument
today.
indeed,
in
1966
when
it
filed
an
account,
in
1975
when
it
filed
an
account,
it
admitted
an
obligation
to
pay
some
of
these
revenues
which
it
now
denies.
now,
the
master
stressed
a
quite
different
point
which
was
a
provision
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
act;
that
provision
is
to
the
effect
that
when
payments
are
made
pursuant
to
an
agreement
with
the
state,
the
payments
by
the
lessee
to
the
state
shall
be
taken
as
compliance
with
what
would
otherwise
be
the
requirement
of
payments
to
the
secretary.
it
seems
to
us
perfectly
plain
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
what
that
means
is
no
more
than
that
the
lessee
is
not
in
default
while
he
is
paying,
as
the
united
states
has
agreed
with
louisiana,
he
may
pay
the
state.
it
in
no
way
excuses
the
state
from
refunding
that
money
when
it
is
determined
that
the
area
was
a
federal
one.
finally,
louisiana
makes
the
novel
argument
that
they
didn't
really
lease
our
lands,
and
they
give
you
a
diagram
which
suggests
that
in
most
instances
a
little
sliver
turned
out
to
be
federal,
but
most
of
the
lease
was
really
state
lands.
that
is
very
deceptive.
first
of
all,
there
are
many
cases
in
which
90
percent,
50
percent
or
a
larger
portion
of
the
lease
was
federal.
there
are
indeed
145
leases
in
which
the
entire
area
described
in
the
lease
turned
out
to
be
federal
lands.
in
those
circumstances,
to
say
that
the
monies
are
not
attributable
to
the
federal
area
is
an
argument
that
i
don't
suppose
louisiana
would
advance.
and
yet
can
the
result
turn
on
whether
it
is
10
percent
of
the
lease
area
or
50
percent
or
100
percent,
or
can
it
turn
on
whether
there
was
actual
drilling,
because
louisiana
concedes
that
the
lion's
share
of
the
money
we
are
talking
about,
some
$12
million,
derives
from
royalties
directly
received
from
the
portion
of
the
lease
that
is
federally
owned.
in
that
case,
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
money
does
not
derive,
in
the
words
of
the
decree,
from
the
federal
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
not
surprising,
mr.
justice
white,
since
it
was
indeed
beyond
any
argument
that
louisiana
had
been
able
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
there
was,
of
course,
a
surface
symmetry
to
louisiana's
conceding
what
they
weren't
claiming,
but
it
hardly
seems
a
quid
pro
quo.
one
word
on
the
interest
issue.
here,
of
course,
the
master
ruled
with
the
united
states
and
we
entirely
endorse
the
reasoning
of
this
report.
he
addressed
both
of
louisiana's
arguments,
somewhat
inconsistent
but
never
mind.
the
first
was
that
the
united
states
had
a
duty
to
invest
these
funds
and,
having
failed
to
do
so,
it
must
in
equity
be
held
to
the
consequence
if
it
had
done
what
it
was
obliged
to
do.
as
to
that,
the
master
said,
in
our
view
entirely
correctly,
that
indisputably
--
these
are
his
words
--
the
interim
agreement
does
not
specifically
provide
for
the
payment
of
interest
upon
any
part
of
the
funds
impounded
pursuant
to
it.
and
indeed
louisiana,
for
all
present
purposes,
i
think
concedes
that
that
is
so.
but,
they
say,
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
that
the
united
states
would
some
time
or
other
invest
the
funds,
to
which
the
master
answers,
the
evidence
in
this
case
clearly
negatives
any
such
understanding
upon
the
part
of
the
parties
to
the
interim
agreement.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
we
had
invested
it
not
pursuant
to
the
agreement
but
for
our
own
purposes,
which
would
have
served
no
interest
of
the
united
states,
taking
from
one
pocket
and
putting
it
in
the
other,
but
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference,
i
quite
agree.
now,
louisiana
further
says
we
unjustly
enriched
ourselves
because
we
didn't
do
what
the
agreement
required
which
was
to
segregate
the
funds.
the
master
said,
incontrovertibly,
it
seems
to
us,
the
treasury
does
not
keep
money
or
cash
in
an
office
safe,
obviously
the
cash
is
going
to
be
freely
used
in
the
same
way
that
a
bank
uses
the
depositor's
money.
it
must
keep
a
strict
account,
it
must
put
it
down
as
potential
liability,
so
when
the
day
comes
that
money
will
be
available
without
a
congressional
appropriation.
those
are
important
reasons
for
treating
it
as
different
from
ordinary
money
of
the
treasury.
the
cash,
of
course,
is
to
be
freely
used.
if
i
may,
i
reserve
the
remaining
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
can
be
very
brief
and
use
less
than
that
allotted
time.
one,
two
answers
to
questions
asked
by
the
court
with
respect
to
the
interest
issue.
it
should
be
known
that
louisiana
received
monthly
reports
from
1956
to
date
indicating
precisely
how
much
money
was
impounded
in
the
treasury.
those
reports
very
clearly
reflected
during
all
that
period
that
no
interest
or
other
increment
was
being
added
to
the
fund,
therefore
no
question
of
surprise.
secondly,
in
1960,
four
years
after
the
agreement
had
been
in
effect,
louisiana's
congressional
delegation,
both
senate
and
all
members
of
the
house,
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
and
the
legislature
of
louisiana
concurred
in
requesting
not
that
the
funds
be
invested,
not
that
interest
be
paid,
but
that
the
monies
in
the
treasury
be
transferred
to
louisiana
banks
so
that
they
could
enjoy
the
free
use
of
that
money.
that
request
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
it
would
set
an
unfortunate
precedent.
then
louisiana
received
its
$34
million
in
1966,
no
complaint
about
the
failure
to
add
interest.
in
1967,
the
louisiana
legislature,
as
represented,
did
memorialize
federal
officials
to
hence
forward
--
not
for
the
past
--
please
respectfully
request
is
their
language,
invest
these
funds.
no
claim
that
there
was
a
duty
to
invest,
no
claim
that
they
had
a
right
to
interest
for
the
sums
they
had
just
been
paid,
but
simply
a
request
to
change
the
agreement
for
the
future,
in
effect.
the
fiscal
assistant
secretary
of
the
treasury
responded
that
treasury
regulations
forbid
him
from
making
any
such
investment
in
the
absence
of
statutory
authority.
it
may
be
that
the
'56
agreement
could
have
been
amended
to
so
provide.
louisiana
did
not
suggest
it.
they
didn't
take
the
matter
further.
they
never
said
another
thing
about
it
until
1975.
now,
they
could
have
asked
for
an
amendments
of
the
agreement.
or
if
the
duty
already
arose
under
the
'56
agreement,
obviously
they
could
have
come
to
this
court
and
said
we
will
not
accept
the
response
by
federal
officials.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that
if
the
agreement
had
accordingly
been
amended
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
might
properly
be
viewed
as
an
implied
amendment
of
the
agreement
done
at
the
request
of
louisiana,
the
acquiescence
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
monies
held
under
the
agreement.
one
could
say
that
had
varied
the
agreement
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
in
these
circumstances
i
don't,
think
we
would
owe
interest
because
the
agreement
doesn't
provide
for
it,
but
there
would
be
an
equitable
claim
that
we
should
have
some
of
the
benefit
of
it.
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
equities
are
no
stronger
against
our
use
of
the
money
than
they
are
with
respect
to
louisiana's
use
of
our
money
for
thirty
years
on
which
we
claim
no
interest
and
have
no
right
to
claim
any
interest.
it
was
part
of
the
bargain
that
louisiana
would
enjoy
these
revenues
until
such
time
as
they
lost
the
land,
if
that
day
should
come.
it
was
also
part
of
the
bargain
that
the
united
states
would
hold
and
use
the
funds
in
escrow
in
the
treasury.
that
bargain
was
made,
it
was
never
varied,
and
both
parties
had
agreed
to
it.
