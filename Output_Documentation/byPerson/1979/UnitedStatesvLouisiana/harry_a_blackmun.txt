justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
were
they
paid
over
without
interest
at
that
time?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
the
interest
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
claiborne,
i
take
it
that
if
the
interim
agreement
had
not
come
into
existence,
this
issue
would
not
be
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
was
the
practical
reason
for
that
distinction
in
treatment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
a
rather
remarkable
argument,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
you
are
saying
that
they
secretly
knew
the
united
states
would
not
accept
a
condition
which
they
thought
was
implicit
in
the
understanding.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
other
words,
they
horn
swoggled
the
united
states.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
mean
the
louisiana
witnesses
so
testified?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
saying
the
louisiana
witnesses
testified
as
to
the
reason
why
the
united
states
representatives
didn't
bring
it
up?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
how
did
they
know
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
their
presumption
as
to
what
the
united
states
negotiators
may
have
thought
surely
has
no
probative
value
whatsoever,
does
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
that
was
so
clearly
in
their
minds,
i
find
it
remarkable
that
they
wouldn't
discuss
the
rate
of
interest.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
apparently
you
didn't
have
the
case,
one,
at
least
at
the
master's
level.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let's
go
back
a
step.
do
you
think
the
united
states
understood,
when
they
signed
this
agreement
and
called
it
an
escrow
agreement,
that
they
were
going
to
pay
interest?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
just
said,
i
take
it,
that
subjectively
the
louisiana
negotiators
knew
that
the
united
states
had
no
intention
or
paying
interest.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
i
mean
you
can't
say
that
the
united
states
signed
an
escrow
agreement
and
they
must
have
intended
to
pay
interest
and
yet
they
didn't.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
louisiana
did
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
but
what
about
the
united
states,
not
intending
to
pay
interest?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
way
do
you
run
it,
that
they
would
or
that
they
should
or
shouldn't
pay
interest?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
wasn't
any
of
the
principle
ever
paid
over,
by
the
way?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
with
interest
or
without?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
wouldn't
your
claim
for
interest
have
been
good
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
except
that
i
suppose
you
are
certainly
claiming
interest
on
that
amount
that
was
paid
over
to
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
would
have
thought
somebody
would
have
stopped
interest
on
that
amount
by
paying
interest.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
not
a
murmur
about
interest
at
that
time?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
it
even
cross
your
mind
at
that
time?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
are
speaking
for
the
united
states
and
you
ought
to
be
able
to
speak
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let's
back
up
a
second
--
and
interest
paid
over?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know,
but
the
resolution
should
have
said
invested
and
interest
paid.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know,
but
you
say
investing
it,
you
say
that
automatically
implies
that
any
return
comes
to
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
ellis,
before
you
leave
that,
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
you
would
not
have
objected.
if
they
had
invested
in
companies
that
produced
dividends
like
gulf
state
utilities?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
equity
securities
would
have
been
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
who
would
have
borne
the
risk
of
loss?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
all
of
this
is
implied,
that
where
the
risk
of
loss
is
and
what
the
rate
of
return
would
be
and
all
the
rest
of
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
must
have
cited
some
authority
for
it,
an
assistant
secretary.
