justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ellis,
can
i
just
ask
you
one
question
about
that.
i
understand
the
language
of
the
lease
to
refer
to
the
area
belonging
to
the
state
of
louisiana
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
is
there
a
finding
by
the
master
that
in
fact
no
revenues
were
derived
from
the
areas
that
were
ultimately
adjudged
to
belong
to
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
read
that
language
to
say
that.
maybe
i
missed
something.
would
that
language,
would
you
suggest,
cover
a
lease
that
just
happened
to
turn
out
to
be
covered
only
land
that
actually
belonged
to
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
were
some,
weren't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
say
about
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
louisiana
keeps
that
money,
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
language
in
the
lease,
in
my
example
the
language
in
the
lease
wouldn't
require
them
to
pay
any
money
to
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
it
was
paid
by
mistake
to
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
turns
out
that
they
were
paying
money
on
land
that
was
not
owned
by
louisiana
but
by
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ellis,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
extraction
of
minerals
in
area
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
where
the
payment
was
made
to
louisiana?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
the
case,
the
united
states
claims
that
there
is
a
certain
area
over
which
they
had
jurisdiction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
was
leased
out
by
louisiana
from
which
louisiana
derived
revenue,
and
that
revenue
was
generated
by
oil
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
what
the
leases
say.
i
am
talking
about
the
physical
facts,
that
there
may
have
been
some
money
paid
by
an
oil
company
to
louisiana
because
they
took
some
oil
out
of
the
area
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
you
say
that
didn't
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
this,
then,
did
the
master
find
that
it
did
not
happen?
