there
is
no
what?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
how
much
is
involved
in
that,
mr.
claiborne?
justice
potter
stewart
this
involves
zone
1,
so-called?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
side,
it
involves
zone
4,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
what
you
call
extravagant
claims,
it
would
have
involved
zone
4.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
master
held
that
you
owed
no
interest
or
its
equivalent
and
also
held
that
you
were
not
entitled
to
get
the
rents
erroneously
or
royalties
erroneously
paid
to
louisiana?
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
get
it
correct
or
incorrect?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
i
am
getting
old,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
getting
deaf
because
i
don't
hear
you
very
well.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
an
interest
claim,
where
interest
is
an
equivalent,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
another
way
of
saying
that
is
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
you
value
it?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
hire
money,
what
you
pay
is
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
united
states
had
held
your
money
in
a
separate
fund,
never
used
it,
just
deposited
it
in
some
bank
somewhere
and
there
it
sat
and
drew
no
interest
whatsoever.
justice
potter
stewart
and
damages
would
be
the
interest
that
the
money
would
have
earned?
