well,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
your
submission,
would
it,
mr.
solicitor
general,
if
the
united
states
had
invested
it.
justice
byron

what
if
you
had
invested
it?
suppose
there
had
been
statutory
authority
available
to
the
fiscal
officer
to
invest
the
money
and
he
went
out
and
invested
it
and
interest
was
earned
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
talking
about
this
agreement.
this
agreement
didn't
call
for
investing
or
interest,
but
you
nevertheless
invest
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you
had
invested
it
from
the
outset?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
isn't
there
an
equitable
claim
that
they
should
have
the
benefit
of
your
use
of
the
money?
i
mean,
you
have
used
it
for
your
benefit.
