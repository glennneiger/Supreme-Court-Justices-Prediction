mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
i
was
on
the
case
at
that
time.
your
honor,
in
further
response
to
the
question
raised,
our
attorney
general
was
not,
and
there
was
a
demand,
a
formal
resolution
of
the
louisiana
legislature
enacted,
i
believe
in
1967
--
it
is
in
the
record
of
the
case,
it
has
been
argued
in
brief
--
whereby
the
louisiana
legislature
formally
requested,
noting
the
passage
of
time
that
these
funds
remaining
in
the
controversy
then
be
invested.
it
was
a
reaction
not
merely
by
an
attorney
general
but
all
the
representatives
of
the
people
of
louisiana
who
were
incensed
at
the
treatment
at
that
time
and
resulted
in
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
there
was
not
interest
paid
over,
no,
sir.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
well,
investments
may
be
by
dividends
also,
such
as
gulf
state
utilities
company,
et
cetera.
we
would
not
have
minded
if
the
return
had
been
in
the
form
of
dividends
rather
than
merely
interest.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
to
the
winner,
for
the
benefit
of
the
ultimate
winner
of
the
contested
funds.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
it
was
communicated
to
the
united
states
as
a
request
pursuant
to
what
was
construed
as
a
duty
of
the
united
states
under
the
agreement,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
that's
correct,
that
was
not,
no.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
there
was.
the
united
states
did
not
agree
with
the
request
and
it
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
they
denied
understanding
and
authority
to
make
investments.
we
had
requested
that
they
be
invested
in
banks.
now,
turning
to
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes,
sir,
interest
is
not
the
only
thing
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
of
course,
the
trustee
would
have
had
prudent
responsibilities
to
invest
soundly.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes,
your
honor.
turning
to
the
zone
1
issue
and
i
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
there
was
a
letter
in
response
to
it.
it
is
referred
to
in
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
i
believe
it
is
in
the
record,
yes.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
i
do
not
recall
the
name
of
the
official
offhand.
i
believe
it
was
a
mr.
carlock.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
i
believe
he
was
fiscal
assistant
secretary
for
the
department
of
the
treasury.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
the
department
of
the
treasury,
which
was
the
entity
holding
the
funds.
turning
to
the
zone
1
issue
--
and
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honors,
that
it
is
indeed
only
a
zone
1
issue
--
i
could
not
have
been
more
shocked
if
the
united
states
had
stood
before
this
court
and
posed
the
issue
as
to
how
many
times
do
i
beat
my
wife.
there
were
assumptions
implicit
in
the
united
states
statement
of
the
issues
that
are
just
simply
incorrect
and
grossly
inaccurate.
for
example,
the
statement
that
we
have
not
paid
or
credited
funds
in
zones
2
or
3,
we
have.
our
accounting
show
this.
our
defenses
are
solely
made
in
our
pleadings
as
to
zone
1;
145
leases
are
referred
to
in
zone
2,
we
have
made
credits
in
our
accounting.
i
don't
know
how
the
united
states
got
this.
additionally,
the
united
states
in
stating
the
issue
as
it
has
has
built
an
assumption
on
an
important
factual
issue
that
the
master
found
contrary
of
the
assumption.
let
me
read
this,
"the
united
states
respectfully
excepts
to
the
report
of
the
special
master
insofar
as
he
recommends
overruling
its
objections
to
the
accountings"
--
and
it
goes
on
and
refers
to
the
funds
--
"as
derived
from
or
attributable
to
submerged
lands
adjudicated
to
be
within
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
united
states."
the
assumption
is
explicit.
as
in
a
question
related
to
wife
beating,
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
funds
are
derived
from
or
attributable
to
the
united
states,
and
quite
to
the
contrary
of
this
assumption,
the
master
upon
the
consideration
of
118
lease
documents
and
approximately
another
80-something
documents
that
were
in
the
lease
files
related
to
them,
200-plus
documents
altogether,
the
testimony
of
numerous
witnesses
about
the
custom
in
the
industry,
understanding
what
these
phrases
in
these
mineral
documents
meant,
the
master
found
as
a
fact
at
the
bottom
of
page
18
of
his
report
--
and
the
language
was
inserted
in
all
of
them
--
that
is
was
leasing
the
right
to
extract
minerals
only
--
and
we
were
paid
only
for
it
--
from
those
parts
of
the
described
areas
belonging
to
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
i
quote
that
as
language
from
the
granting
language
of
the
mineral
lease,
or
such
as
were
"owned
by
the
state
of
louisiana."
we
have
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
appendix
1,
which
details
at
length
the
language
of
these
various
leases,
and
the
rents,
the
bonuses,
the
rentals
were
computed
on
the
basis
of
what
was
owned
by
louisiana.
indeed,
we
doubtlessly
got
smaller
bids
because
there
were
some
areas
in
controversy.
there
was
only
one
area
where
a
bay
was
one
by
the
united
states,
and
that
was
caillou
bay,
and
this
involved
two
leases,
leases
granted
before
1950
and
the
revenues
from
the
time
before
1950
we
were
not
obliged
to
account
for.
every
other
one
under
the
language
of
the
court's
decree
in
1975,
which
tracks
back
to
the
history
of
the
language
in
1950,
every
other
one
of
those
leases
contain
language
such
as
the
maser
had
used
there.
and
as
the
master
found,
these
rentals
were
not
derived
from.
that
is
the
first
of
two
major
points
we
make,
is
that
the
monies
claimed
by
the
united
states
were
simply
not
derived
from
the
areas
of
zone
1
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes,
that
language
i
just
read.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
in
that
event
there
would
be
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
i
believe
there
was
one
or
two
out
of
the
118
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
i
say
that
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
of
course,
we
have
a
name
for
it
in
the
civil
law,
the
sale
of
the
hoke.
it
is
like
the
sale
of
the
cast
of
a
fisherman's
net.
if
you
have
any
right
there
or
if
anything
materialized
from
it,
it
is
covered.
if
it
does
not
materialize,
if
the
fish
are
not
in
the
net,
it
does
not
win
the
lawsuit.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
not
necessarily.
your
honor
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
not
on
land
but
on
the
right
that
might
or
might
not
exist.
there
was,
your
honor,
additionally
payments
to
the
united
states.
there
were
dual
payments,
in
many
instances,
by
oil
companies
and
we
reached
agreement,
the
united
states
and
louisiana,
that
in
the
instance
of
dual
payments
we
would
not
object
to
the
accountings;
where
we
got
paid
and
they
got
paid
back
in
the
early
fifties,
some
of
this
was
going
on
in
that
instance.
now,
in
an
instance
where
both
governments
were
paid
--
and
i
believe
that
happened
in
many
instances
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
that
there
was
no
extraction
of
minerals
in
areas
won
by
the
united
states?
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes,
i
disagree
with
that
because
the
leases
described
and
leased
only
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
i
don't
believe
that
happened,
your
honor.
incidentally
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
i
do
not
recall
that
there
was
an
explicit
negation
of
that
happening,
your
honor.
there
were
so-called
unit
agreements
which
are
pooling
a
agreements
which
it
was
agreed
would
be
revised
under
an
amendment
to
the
interim
agreement
of
1956,
which
it
was
agreed
would
be
revised
after
the
interim
agreement
--
pardon
me,
after
the
final
degree
in
the
case
to
revise
the
participation.
incidentally,
let
me
turn
to
some
of
the
language
of
that
interim
agreement
to
make
the
point
that
apart
from
the
question
of
what
was
derived
from
and
even
conceding
arguendo
only
for
the
moment
that
we
were
to
lose,
still
there
would
be
the
position
of
louisiana,
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
interim
agreement,
rights
under
which
were
reserved
in
paragraph
13
of
the
court's
decree
of
1975,
conferred
upon
louisiana
the
right
to
lease
and
the
right
to
retain
the
revenues
from
that
leasing.
incidentally,
on
that
problem,
your
honor,
the
master
did
explicitly
make
a
finding,
a
fact
finding
upon
the
hearing
of
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
upon
the
reading
of
the
documents
and
the
cross-interpretation
of
it,
that
there
was
an
intent
for
both
the
united
states
as
to
zone
4
--
and
the
deal
was
the
same
as
to
both
governments
--
and
louisiana
as
to
zone
1
to
not
only
grant
leases
but
to
receive
and
retain
the
revenues
under
that
leasing
arrangement.
for
example,
as
language
in
the
interim
agreement
that
explicitly
relates
to
the
retention
of
payments,
also
this
agreement
as
between
--
i
refer
to
page
18a
of
the
government's
brief,
the
last
sentence
of
subparagraph
(c)
of
paragraph
14
of
the
interim
agreement
-
"also,
this
agreement
as
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
louisiana,
shall
continue
in
effect
as
to
the
payments
made
with
respect
to
such
lease."
it
was
contemplated
that
payments
would
be
made
under
the
lease,
and
even
after
the
decree
the
agreement
would
continue
to
be
effective,
to
have
sort
of
legalized
and
authorized
those
payments
that
have
been
made
to
the
party
authorized
for
them
to
be
made
under
the
agreement.
additionally,
in
the
language
of
the
interim
agreement,
this
stipulation
and
agreement
shall
terminate
as
to
any
area
--
this
is
in
paragraph
14,
the
second
paragraph
thereof
--
shall
terminate
as
to
any
area
upon
the
final
settlement
or
determination
of
the
aforesaid
controversy
with
respect
to
such
area,
and
the
word
"thereafter"
then
appears
--
and
thereafter
the
successful
party
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
control
over
the
area
so
determined.
we
received
a
contract
right,
your
honor,
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
control
over
zone
1,
and
that
is
all
we
are
claiming
here,
your
honor.
it
has
been
incorrectly
represented
that
our
position
relates
to
zone
2
and
zone
3.
this
is
all
we
are
claiming
here,
is
a
right
in
zone
1
in
this
connection,
under
this
provision.
i
would
like
to
point
out
too
that
if
there
is
broad
language
of
the
decree,
indeed
there
is,
that
sums
derived
--
and
this
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
--
that
all
sums
derived
from
mineral
leasing
or
from
mineral
resources
from
property
belonging
to
the
other
government
should
be
paid
to
the
other
government,
then,
your
honors,
i
submit
that
the
very
reasoning
of
the
united
states
on
the
zone
1
claim
sustains
the
claim
of
louisiana
to
the
sums
of
money
derived
from
the
natural
resources
of
louisiana
through
financial
benefits
enjoyed
by
the
united
states
through
the
use
of
the
mineral
leasing
revenue
of
louisiana,
and
that
this
court
has
already
adjudicated
that
issue.
thank
you.
