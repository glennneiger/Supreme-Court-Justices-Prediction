mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
you
have
come
to
the
end
almost
of
a
long,
long
day
and
we
in
louisiana
are
trying
to
come
to
the
end
of
long,
long
lawsuit.
and
if
i
may
for
just
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
bring
you
back
to
the
story
that
happened
because
you
must
know
the
facts
to
have
a
feel
for
it,
you
can't
feel
for
it
by
the
academic
expressions
that
are
contained
in
these
briefs.
in
1956,
the
united
states
of
america
filed
suit
in
this
court
to
stop
all
leasing
out
in
the
gulf
off
louisiana's
coast.
now,
between
1947
and
1956,
and
industry
had
begun
to
build,
and
fellows
who
were
fishermen
became
skippers
on
boats
bringing
people
out
to
the
rigs,
and
we
brought
people
from
texas
and
alabama
and
mississippi
who
want
to
work
in
the
shipyards
building
rigs
for
the
outer
continental
shelf
development,
and
this
industry
was
beginning
to
burgeon
in
1956
when
the
united
states
governments
comes
to
this
court
and
says
let's
stop
all
this
leasing
because
louisiana
is
actually
leasing
on
some
land
that
belongs
to
us.
this
court
issued
an
injunction
and
that
injunction
literally
brought
the
economy
of
south
louisiana
to
a
standstill.
people
couldn't
go
to
work.
they
stopped
building
the
rigs.
they
didn't
know
what
they
were
going
to
do.
the
economy
was
faced
with
a
possible
discretion,
so
louisiana
runs
up
to
the
department
of
the
interior
and
says,
look,
we've
got
to
do
something
to
get
this
business
going
again,
you're
throwing
people
out
of
work,
you're
depriving
us
of
income,
it's
going
to
hurt
a
lot
of
good
people.
so
the
government
says,
well,
i
will
tell
you
what
we'll
do.
the
then
secretary
of
the
interior
took
a
pencil
and
he
figured
out
what
was
the
most
shoreward
line
that
could
possibly
be
the
coast
of
louisiana
and
he
drew
that
line,
and
it
is
called
the
chapman
line.
and
after
he
drew
that
line,
he
said
i
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do,
the
submerged
lands
act
gives
you
three
miles
out
from
the
chapman
line
by
law
and
we
will
let
you
administer
what
the
law
gives
you,
and
you
can
hold
those
proceeds.
then
they
said
from
that
three
miles
to
the
next
three
miles,
and
three
miles
beyond
that,
we
are
going
to
keep
the
money.
do
you
think
louisiana
could
argue
about
it?
do
you
think
this
is
an
arm's
length
agreement
where
two
parties
are
sitting
down
like
in
a
free
discussion?
louisiana
was
forced
to
accept.
they
said,
okay,
you
keep
the
money
that
you
derive
from
that
area,
and
when
you
find
out
whose
money
it
is,
we
want
you
to
give
it
back.
and
then
the
united
states
says
and
we
believe
everything
beyond
that
nine
miles,
which
they
call
zone
4,
is
ours,
so
we
won't
impound
that,
we
will
hold
it.
so
everybody
to
those
discussions
called
that
agreement
an
escrow
agreement,
and
they
wrote
in
the
agreement
that
the
government
would
impound
and
hold
intact
those
funds
until
it
was
decided
who
they
really
belonged
to
and
then
pay
out
from
those
impounded
funds
the
money
that
belonged
to
louisiana.
now,
what
louisiana's
position
is,
that
that
contract
itself
is
pure
and
simply
a
trust
agreement.
not
once
is
the
word
"trust"
used
in
the
contract,
but
that
is
the
simple
reason
that
the
law
that
authorized
the
writing
of
that
contract
used
the
word
"impound"
so
the
government,
in
its
carefulness,
traced
the
law
and
used
the
word
"impound."
but
for
nineteen
years
the
united
states
government
has
held
money
that
belongs
to
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
it
turns
out
that
for
nineteen
years
it
used
that
money
and
it
saved
the
cost
of
borrowing
for
nineteen
years,
and
instead
of
impounding
and
holding
it
intact
like
an
ordinary
escrow
agent
is
obliged
to
do
under
law,
they
used
the
money.
instead
of
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
no,
i
don't
agree,
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
the
united
states
government
in
this
case
is
the
plaintiff,
and
when
it
comes
in
as
a
plaintiff
it
loses
its
sovereignty.
it
comes
in
as
any
other
suitor
and
is
subject
to
all
of
the
laws
and
agreements
of
any
other
suitor.
now,
all
through
the
case,
your
honor,
and
even
in
his
introductory
statement
today,
learned
counsel
for
the
government
says
this
is
an
interest
claim,
and
he
did
that
so
that
he
could
lead
the
master
into
those
line
of
cases
which
refer
to
cases
in
the
court
of
claims
that
the
government
simply
cannot
pay
interest
unless
it
is
provided
for
by
specific
statute
or
by
contract.
and
sure
enough,
the
master
followed
that
line
of
thought,
but
that
is
not
what
the
case
is.
we
are
not
in
the
court
of
claims.
this
is
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
a
case
between
two
sovereigns,
not
an
individual
citizen
trying
to
make
a
claim
in
the
court
of
claims.
we
are
claiming
that
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
our
own
money
they
owed
us
the
obligation
to
invest
that
money
as
a
prudent
escrow
agent
would
do
for
the
benefit
of
the
ultimate
beneficiary
that
we
were;
otherwise
louisiana
negotiators
would
be
giving
away
something
they
had
no
right
to
give
away.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
no.
please,
it
is
not
merely
semantics.
we
are
claiming
the
value
of
the
use
of
that
money
by
the
united
states.
now,
often
the
courts
have
used
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
wait,
please.
often
the
courts
have
used
interest
as
a
measure
of
value
of
the
use
of
money,
but
there
is
a
difference
and
we
are
claiming
the
value
of
the
use
of
that
money,
albeit
this
court
in
its
wisdom
may
choose
to
value
it
at
the
interest
that
the
united
states
saved
by
using
louisiana's
money.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
i
think
i
would
value
it
the
same
way.
but
the
basic
legal
distinction
is
different.
we
are
not
suing
for
interest
on
a
debt.
we
are
suing
for
interest
on
our
own
money.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
don't
agree,
however,
that
that
is
what
this
suit
is
about.
in
ordinary
parlance,
when
you
borrow
money
--
but
we
didn't
lend
the
government
our
money
on
which
they
should
pay
us
interest.
they
in
effect
confiscated
our
money
and
said
unless
you
let
us
confiscate
it,
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
drill
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
want
to
get
across.
that
is
more
of
a
confiscation
for
which
they
owe
us
just
compensation.
all
right.
now,
a
sovereign
state
is
not
the
same.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
that
is
the
tin
can
theory.
they
would
be
so
derelict
in
all
law
that
relates
to
trust
obligations
that
they
would
owe
us
damages
for
failing
to
invest
it,
and
that
is
the
law
and
there
is
a
line
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief
to
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
if
you
wish
to
measure
them
in
that
way.
you
may
see
fit
to
find
some
other
way.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
well,
you
know
we
rely
in
our
brief
on
an
1841
statute
that
says
that
the
government
shall
invest
trust
funds
and
government
securities
at
5
percent.
now,
over
the
years
rates
have
varied
from
time
to
time
and
our
calculation
for
the
--
this
amounts
to
$88
million,
according
to
louisiana's
calculation
which
was
based
on
buying
short-term
securities,
because
we
never
knew
when
this
case
might
come
to
an
end,
and
at
the
end
of
each
short-term
security
maturity
the
money
would
be
reinvested
and
then
compounded
in
that
way,
and
that
is
the
manner
in
which
we
arrived.
you
may
not
see
fit
to
arrive
at
it
that
way.
the
government
does
in
the
brief.
but
some
manner
of
computing
the
value
of
the
use
by
the
government
of
louisiana's
money
ought
to
be
determined,
and
we
don't
feel
that
immunity
is
a
defense.
now,
the
master
gives
only
two
factual
points
in
support
of
his
conclusion
that
the
agreement
itself
doesn't
impliedly
require
investment
at
interest
for
the
benefit
of
louisiana.
and
those
two
reasons
are,
one,
he
says
the
subject
was
never
discussed,
and
that
is
true.
it
wasn't
discussed
whether
the
united
states
would
pay
interest
and
it
wasn't
discussed
whether
they
would
not
pay
interest;
neither
side
brought
it
up.
so
that
is
not
conclusive
as
to
what
the
parties
to
the
agreement
thought.
then
he
brings
out
the
second
point
but,
do
you
know,
he
says
the
louisiana
witnesses
who
negotiated
this
contract
admitted
that
the
reason
they
didn't
bring
it
up
was
because
they
knew
the
united
states
wouldn't
agree
to
pay
it,
so
he
says
that
solves
it.
well,
first
of
all,
that
is
a
subjective
consideration.
but
he
doesn't
report
to
it
is
court
the
rest
of
what
they
thought.
they
didn't
bring
it
up,
their
testimony
shows,
because
they
felt
it
was
contained
implicitly
in
the
words
of
the
contract,
than
this
was
an
escrow
agreement
and
that
the
escrow
agent,
to
wit,
the
united
states,
was
obliged
to
pay
that
interest
when
it
finally
made
the
distribution.
that
is
why
they
didn't
bring
it
up.
so
if
you
want
to
take
what
they
had
in
their
minds
when
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
that's
right,
they
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
oh,
no.
no,
no,
no,
because
the
united
states
didn't
bring
it
up
either.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
by
the
same
that
the
witnesses
that
the
united
states
didn't
bring
it
up
because
they
knew
louisiana
wouldn't
agree
to
it.
neither
party
brought
it
up.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
what's
that?
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
that's
why
they
thought
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
well,
they
wouldn't,
know
that,
your
honor,
but
if
you
are
going
to
take
--
of
course
they
wouldn't
know
it,
but
they
presumed
that
the
reason
the
united
states
didn't
bring
it
up
was
the
same
reason
that
they
wouldn't
bring
it
up.
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there.
if
you
are
going
to
take
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
and
their
presumption
about
what
they
had
in
their
minds
has
only
probative
value
if
you
take
the
entire
context
of
what
they
had
in
their
minds,
and
what
they
had
in
their
minds
was
these
words
that
have
been
written
down
and
handed
to
us
by
the
united
states
that
imply
that
that
escrow
agent
has
to
pay
interest
to
us.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
listen,
i
always
learned
if
you've
got
your
case,
one,
you
shut
up.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
but
we
thought
so
at
the
table
of
negotiation,
so
that
was
the
intention
of
our
people
at
that
time.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
once
you
demolish
these
subjective
thoughts,
you
come
to
the
real
evidence
and
the
real
evidence
--
and
it
is
stated
to
be
factually
correct
in
the
report
of
the
master
--
is,
one,
the
negotiators
for
louisiana
and
the
united
states,
both
refer
to
this
agreement
as
an
escrow
agreement,
before
and
after
the
agreement
was
confected.
now,
it
is
argued
in
the
brief
and
it
was
alluded
to
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
if
they
knew
the
law
of
escrow
and
the
responsibility
of
trustees,
certainly
the
knew
it.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
they
thought
that.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
they
felt
that
what
would
govern
would
be
the
words
of
that
contract,
and
i
have
to
tell
you
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
i
don't
know
what
they
thought.
but
i
have
to
say
this,
everybody
thought
--
and
this
is
uncontradicted
evidence
in
the
record
--
everybody
thought
that
this
agreement
was
short-lived.
there
is
testimony
that
they
thought
it
might
be
six
months,
maybe
a
year,
a
year
at
the
most
that
it
would
last.
and
i
think
that
has
some
bearing.
i
want
to
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
no,
i
would
run
that
to
the
effect
that,
no
matter
what
they
thought,
interest
would
have
to
begin
at
the
end
of
the
longest
period
of
time,
a
year
and
six
months,
because
that
is
all
they
were
thinking
about,
all
of
the
parties
at
that
table.
instead,
the
thing
goes
on
for
nineteen
years.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
all
right.
some
of
it
was.
in
1965,
this
court
had
made
an
interim
determination
that
some
bays
belonged
to
louisiana,
and
a
distribution
was
made
at
that
time
of
$37
million.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
no,
just
a
check
for
the
principle,
no
interest.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
no,
and
i
will
tell
you
why.
at
that
time
this
court
specifically
retained
jurisdiction
to
settle
all
accounting
matters
relating
to
this
case
with
the
final
decree,
so
there
was
no
reason
to
bring
it
up
then
when
that
determination
would
be
made
after
the
final
decree
and
we
did
not
bring
it
up.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
yes,
certainly
we
are.
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
well,
i
wish
they
had.
they
didn't
and
we
didn't
ask
for
it
and
they
claim
that
is
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
not
a
murmur.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
i
only
became
attorney
general
--
mr.
william
j.
guste,
jr.
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
really
don't
know
those
things.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
let
me
just
end
by
saying
that
we
also
argue
that
equity
requires
it.
they
unjustly
enriched
themselves
at
the
expense
of
louisiana
and
the
law
of
condemnation
requires
it
because
they
acquired
our
property
against
our
will
in
effect
and
used
it
and
benefitted.
thank
you.
