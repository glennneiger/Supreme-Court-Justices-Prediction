your
client's
shipment
was
--
was
(inaudible)
type
of
thing.
wasn't
either
a
--
not
the
client's
real
name
as
sender
and
not
the
--
the
consignee
was
not
a
real
person?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
not
many
travel
under
the
name
l'eggs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
description
prepared
by
your
clients
that
kind
of
cover
for
the
films?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
ground
for
a
reversal
in
this
court
if
there
were
a
proffer
of
evidence
that
a
juror
had
dozed
off
during
the
testimony
of
the
witness
in
an
--
the
--
the
case
of
perfectly
orthodox
tour
or
contract
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you'd
have
a
lot
reversal,
if
you
require
the
juror
to
give
his
undivided
attention
from
10
to
12
and
1:30
to
4:30,
five
days
a
week,
whenever
the
court
said
if
you
required
every
--
everyone
of
the
12
jurors.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
almost
goes
to
the
common
law
of
trover,
doesn't
it,
as
to
whether
someone
to
whom
goods
are
delivered
who
does
not
own
the
goods
is
obligated
to
return
them
to
someone
he
knows
whether
a
demand
has
to
be
made
and
that
sort
of
thing.
that's
more
of
a
civil
law
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
following
up
on
justice
powell's
questions
about
the
difficult
fourth
amendment
issues
in
this
case
is
--
would
you
agree
there
isn't
as
bright
a
line
as
might
be
implied
between
the
simple
suitcase
or
steamer
trunk
which
one
has
reason
to
believe
might
contain
a
contraband
and
say
a
pistol
holster
with
the
outlines
of
a
pistol
on
it
as
to
whether
that
may
or
may
not
be
plain
view?
you
can't
actually
see
the
pistol
and
yet
the
chance
is
99
out
of
100
that
it
does
have
a
pistol
in
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
--
they
left
--
as
i
understand
on
the
third
call,
the
woman
finally
left
her
name,
but
on
no
calls,
they
leave
their
address
where
they
could
be
reached.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
were
the
bills
of
lading
instructed
to
be
destroyed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
that
there
were
any
instructions
to
that
effect?
