well,
what
if
they
had
been
simply
stolen
by
a
thief
in
transit
they
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
the
property
of
the
thief
even
arguably.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
if
the
thief
had
voluntary
given
them
to
the
fbi?
would
you
have
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
you'd
have
a
larceny,
but
would
you've
had
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
much
as
you
do
here.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
goods
are
presumptively
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
that's
true
whether
it's
a
thief
who
takes
them
or
whether
it
was
the
l'eggs,
l-'-e-g-s
--
e-g-g-s,
that
pronounced
as
l'eggs,
the
stocking
company.
justice
potter
stewart
well
assuming,
if
they
did
consent,
it's
â€“-
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
gives
--
certainly
provides
probable
cause.
but
that's
not
the
end
of
the
problem
as
my
brother
stevens
has
indicated
in
his
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
and
thus
assume
there's
ample
probable
cause
--
as
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
indicated
that
were
was,
but
that's
not
the
end
of
the
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
they
might've
--
it
might've
abandoned
the
films
also,
as
well
as
consented.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
then
--
the
problems
would
disappear
just
as
they
would've
had.
they
consented
to
the
search.
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
conviction
on
all
five.
