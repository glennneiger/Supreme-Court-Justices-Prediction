i
can't
conceive
what
the
procedure
by
which
you
would
just
keep
property
and
not
prosecutor
do
anything
with
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
question
was
do
--
was
it
possible
just
to
keep
it
and
not
do
anything
with
them?
and
you
said
they
could.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
could
keep
it
and
not
do
anything
with
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
if
--
if
you
want
to
answer
--
you
tell
me
where
you
will
keep
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
they
just
keep
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
the
petitioner
demand
from
the
fbi
the
return
of
the
film?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
--
you
--
could
it
be
said
that
up
to
that
time,
you
had
abandoned
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
what
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
lack
of
interest
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
abandonment
would
--
would
stop
prosecution
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wasn't
that
what
you
were
working
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
weren't
you
trying
to
prevent
prosecution
by
abandoning
it?
