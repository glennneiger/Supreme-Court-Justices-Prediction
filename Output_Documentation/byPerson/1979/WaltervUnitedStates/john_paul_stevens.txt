mr.
zell,
what
was
going
to
happen
to
the
films
if
they'd
gone
on
their
intended
route?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
your
client
then
retained
a
--
an
expectation
that
they
would
not
be
publicly
viewed?
what
kind
of
privacy
interest
did
he
retain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
anticipate
that
they
would
be
shown
to
people
that
he
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
exhibited
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
publicly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
understand
sort
of
an
unfair
competition
kind
of
privacy
somebody
shouldn't
be
looking
at
stuff
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
intended
to
sell,
but
is
there
a
constitutional
privacy
interest
in
not
having
somebody
see
that
which
is
being
offered
for
sale
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
clients
didn't
want
to
look
at
them
anymore,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
your
clients
want
to
look
at
them
anymore?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
like
a
privacy
interest
in
a
--
in
a
billboard
or
something
like
that,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
get
by
to
see
--
if
--
if
we
go
by
to
seizure.
i
understand
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
your
point
that
when
they
were
--
got
in
the
fbi's
possession,
i'm
--
i'm
directing
my
question
really
at
--
at
screening,
at
--
at
viewing
them.
when
--
when
as
i
understand
the
purpose
of
the
whole
shipment
was
for
someone
other
than
your
clients
to
view
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
as
i
say,
there's
a
commercial
interest
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
that
they
are
protecting,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schulder
can
i
ask
you
about
your
--
the
argument
that
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy
--
as
i
understand
that
you
make
two
separate
arguments
on
that
point.
one
it's
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
packages
were
labeled.
there
was
never
any
expectation.they
soon
--
they
waived
their
right
because
it
was
very
probable
that
some
third
party
will
get
access
to
them.
now
that's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
if
that's
true
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
are
guns
or
personal
business
records
or
anything
like.
someone
who
just
sends
a
package
to
a
fictitious
person
in
a
way
that
there's
a
fair
chance
it
would
get
lost
and
the
shipment
has
--
gives
up
all
fourth
amendment
interest
in
the
--
does
--
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that
proposition?
that's
a
rather
extreme
position,
i
just
wondered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
your
second
theory
which
is
--
is
quite
different
is
that
--
that
there
were
sufficient
indicia
of
what
the
contents
were
on
the
outside
of
the
box
to
--
to
give
up
any
expectation
of
privacy.
now
in
that
theory,
i
suppose
if
someone
shipped
a
briefcase
in
which
he
said
on
the
outside
of
it,
“records
of
transaction
in
a
swiss
bank
account
between
mr.
a
and
mr.
b”
who
had
previously
denied
they
ever
had
a
swiss
bank
account,
you
could
open
that
without
a
warrant,
because
by
the
outside
of
it,
you
know
the
contents
had
something
illegal
in
or
you'd
have
probable
cause
to
believe
what
it
got
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
position
i
take
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
is
that
if
you
have
probable
cause
from
the
outside
of
a
packet
--
package
to
know
the
contents
are
illegal,
you
can
go
ahead
and
open
without
a
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
if
you
don't
have
probable
cause
you
couldn't
get
a
warrant
so
that
absolutely
removes
the
--
the
requirement
of
a
warrant
from
every
inspecting
parcels
that
come
into
your
possession
that
you
don't
expect
to
get.
you'd
never
need
a
warrant.on
the
one
hand,
if
you
don't
have
probable
cause,
you
can't
get
a
warrant.
if
you
do
have
probable
cause,
you're
saying
you
don't
need
a
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
“clearly
demonstrate,”
do
you
mean
that
it
demonstrates
more
clearly
than
just
giving
probable
cause?
clearly,
it
didn't
have
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt
or
you
would
never
have
had
to
view
the
films.
if
you
view
them,
they'll
be
sure
they
were
what
you
thought
they
were
and
then
there
would
be
proof
of
guilt.
but
what
you're
saying
is
as
i
understand
your
position
is
probable
cause
dispenses
with
the
need
of
a
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
probable
cause
here
is
that
in
labels
on
the
packages
themselves.
that's
what
–
what
i
mean,
you
know,
the
cartons
and
all
that
--
that
is
what
justifies
as
i
understand
your
position.
you're
opening
like
--
viewing
them
is
just
like
opening
other
package
i'd
suppose.
i'm
not
quite
clear.
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
theory
as
to
what
boils
down.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
this
--
that
you
now
argue
with
transparent
bag.
how
clearly
that
it'd
indicate
--
that
it'd
indicate
beyond
reasonable
doubt?
or
that
it'd
give
you
probable
cause
to
know
what
was
in?
and
was
there
some
middle
ground
if
you're
developing
a
new
concept
of
something
more
than
probable
cause
and
something
less
than
evidence
sufficient
to
convict?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schulder,
assume
that
a
misdelivery
occurred
of
a
carton
in
the
same
fashion
you
had
here
and
it
got
into
the
hands
of
the
fbi
and
the
carton
and
had
a
label
on
it
--
this
box
contains
the
records
of
my
purchases
and
sales
of
firearms
and
somebody's
name
on
the
bottom
of
it
and
the
man
was
not
a
registered
firearm
dealer.
could
the
government
open
that
carton
without
a
warrant?
in
the
--
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
--
on
what
theory?
because
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
it
contains
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
all
the
government
needs
to
open
a
container
that
comes
into
its
possession
is
probable
cause,
that's
your
submission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
[laughs]
then
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
in
substance
is
that
your
position
and
--
and
final
analysis
rests
precisely
on
the
grounds
rejecting
in
chadwick.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i've
given
you
an
example
of
a
carton
that
had
exteriors.
i
gave
you
probable
cause
to
believe
there
was
evidence
of
illegal
gun
transactions
within
the
–
within
the
container.
and
i'm
asking
if
you
need
a
warrant
and
you
said,
no,
you
don't.
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
squared
out
with
chadwick.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schulder,
just
curiosity,
how
many
of
the
titles
were
--
of
the
25
titles
were
determined
to
be
obscene?
were
they
all?
i
can't
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
five
is
as
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we
don't
know
about
the
other
20?
