mr.
w.
michael
mayock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
i
would
like
to
do
at
this
time
is
to
address
a
couple
of
points
which
i
believe
should
be
brought
to
the
court's
attention
involving
what
i
ascertain
to
be
mistake
--
misstatements
of
fact
contained
the
government's
brief.
and
one
in
particular,
i
think,
is
incredibly
significant
down
on
page
37
and
--
and
thereafter,
wherein
is
--
it
is
indicated
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
had
decided
to
return
the
films
to
a
warehouse
for
storage.
in
fact
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
purpose
of
the
shipment
to
atlanta
was
for
a
storage.
it
could
well
have
been
that
the
purpose
of
that
transportation
was
in
fact,
to
sell
these
particular
films
in
atlanta
which
as
i
understand,
has
the
highest
per
capita
homosexual
population
outside
of
san
francisco.
there
are
two
other
points
that
i
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
they
relate
to
the
film
--
films
themselves
which
are
8-millimeter
film
that
are
so
small,
they
can
--
they
cannot
be
viewed
by
the
naked
eye.
there
is
apparent
representation
to
the
effect
that
people
at
l'eggs
products
inc.
have
already
ascertained
what
it
was
that
was
on
these
films
when
in
fact,
all
they
had
ascertained
was
the
nature
of
the
box
cover
which
contained
a
depiction
in
cartoon
fashion
of
two
nude
males
from
the
waist
up,
embracing
and
--
and
kissing
and
a
description
purporting
to
represent,
but
not
necessarily
representing
what
it
was
that
was
contained
in
the
films.
obviously,
the
fbi
did
not
believe
that
this
was
necessarily
what
was
contained
in
the
films
because
that
was
the
very
reason
they
screened
them
was
to
find
out
what
it
was
that
was
contained
on
these
films.
mr.
w.
michael
mayock
as
it
turned
out,
your
honor,
the
--
the
films
as
--
were
pretty
much
as
described
in
the
blurb
contained
on
the
box
covers.
the
box
covers
incidentally
were
not
charged
as
being
obscene.
only
the
films
themselves
which
were
later
screened
about
two
months
subsequent
to
the
time
that
they
were
initially
taken
by
the
fbi.
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
address
rather
briefly
several
points
which
i
feel
are
significant,
which
have
not
been
addressed
at
this
point
by
mr.
zell.
first
of
all,
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
scienter
issue.
now,
there
was
clearly
ample
proof
provided
that
my
client,
mr.
walter,
was
engaged
in
a
business
which
dealt
in
sexually
explicit
material.
however,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
hamlin
and
smith,
that
there
has
to
be
some
proof
of
knowledge
showing
that
in
fact,
he
had
information
of
the
nature,
character
and
content
of
the
particular
films.
that
he
knew
they
were
being
shipped
interstate
and
that
he
knew
that
a
common
carrier
was
being
used
for
that
purpose.
there
is
nothing
other
than
a
silent
record
to
indicate
that
mr.
walter
was
involved
in
this
operation
from
a
point
in
time,
two
months
prior
to
this
shipment,
to
a
time,
two
months
subsequent
to
it.
the
government
has
argued
that
there
was
evidence
showing
that
he
participated
directly
in
the
day
to
day
affairs
of
this
particular
business.
however,
there
is
no
evidence
showing
that
any
of
these
other
shipments
purportedly
made
interstate
involved
obscene
material.
and
as
this
court
well
knows
roaden
versus
kentucky
requires
the
presumption
to
be
made
that
material
not
adjudicated
to
be
obscene
is
to
be
presumed
not
obscene.
hence,
the
only
material
properly
brought
before
the
court
and
the
jury
in
this
case
involved
the
films
in
question.
and
as
far
as
those
films
were
concerned,
there's
nothing
given
any
sort
of
nexus
to
mr.
walter
and
those
particular
films
as
far
as
the
element
of
scienter
is
required.
turning
to
the
point
raised
in
the
brief,
in
connection
with
the
requirement
that
the
court
instruct
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
the
pinkus
case
that,
“person”
is
to
mean
adult.
it
need
be
pointed
out
that
on
at
least
five
separate
proposed
jury
instructions,
the
defendant
sought
to
have
that
sort
of
definition
be
made
known.
i
think
that
it's
clear
to
anyone
who
understands
the
english
language
that
the
word,
“person”
subsumes
the
class,
“children”
and
accordingly,
the
instructions
given
by
the
court
were
fatally
defective
for
the
reasons
earlier
enunciated
in
pinkus.
and
the
only
thing
that
we
can
do
and
this
is
what
the
government
would
have
us
do,
is
to
assume
that
obviously
this
jury
forgot
about
children,
because
of
the
instructions
given
and
only
applied
the
attributes
of
the
average
person.
however,
an
average
person
includes
people
of
all
ages,
hence
that
particular
argument
is
not
effective
and
moreover,
to
assume
that
the
jury
did
not
follow
the
directions
of
the
court
and
use
the
standard
of
the
average
person,
would
be
to
do
an
injustice
to
the
jury
and
it's
understanding
of
the
law
as
given
it
by
the
court.
and
moreover,
since
the
jury
verdict
was
a
general
one,
there's
no
way
that
we
can
know
that
in
fact
that
jury
did
not
do
exactly
what
was
forbidden
by
pinkus
--
that
being
to
include
children
within
the
community.
while
we're
talking
about
jurors,
very
briefly
i
would
point
out
that
insofar
as
one
of
the
jurors
was
involved
in
this
case
there
is
testimony.
in
fact,
the
record
by
the
trial
judge
indicates
that
one
of
the
jurors
had
to
be
directed
to
put
away
a
book
or
magazine
on
the
only
occasion
on
which
he
viewed
the
film.
subsequently,
the
jury
did
not
see
the
film
again
in
the
jury
room.
the
trial
judge
observed
that
sufficient
attention
had
been
paid
by
this
particular
juror
in
that
he
observed
that
juror
watching
the
film
on
7
of
10
occasions.
there
were
proffers
of
proof
made
that
members
of
the
press
in
attendance
of
this
trial
would've
observed
that
this
particular
juror
did
not
watch
the
film
for
substantial
periods
of
time.
mr.
w.
michael
mayock
i
think
if
a
sufficient
record
establishing
that
fact
is
made
that
that
may
well
be
the
case.
but
where
we
have
an
observation
by
the
district
judge
saying
that
on
7
out
of
10
times
he
watched
--
in
other
words
70%
of
the
time
he
was
watching
the
film
which
the
dictates
of
miller
versus
california
require
that
the
work
be,
“taken
as
a
whole.”
that
there
is
no
way
he
could
have
taken
it
as
a
whole
watching
only
70%.
mr.
w.
michael
mayock
well,
your
honor,
i
understand
that's
what
we
tried
to
do
when
we
select
a
jury.
in
fact
one
of
the
proffered
voir
dire
questions
to
this
panel
was
whether
they
could
view
this
film
with
an
open
mind
and
open
eyes.
and
that
proffered
voir
dire
questions
was
not
asked
of
the
prospective
panel
and
in
fact
it
turned
out
to
be
very
critical
because
this
juror
obviously
chose
not
to
view
substantial
parts
of
the
film.
mr.
w.
michael
mayock
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
w.
michael
mayock
no,
it
is
not.
it
hasn't
been
raised
directly.
it
was
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit.
insofar
as
the
--
the
last
--
mr.
w.
michael
mayock
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
i
would
obviously
take
the
posture
that
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional.
however,
that
issue
hasn't
been
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
w.
michael
mayock
insofar
as
this
--
mr.
w.
michael
mayock
that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
this
time,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
