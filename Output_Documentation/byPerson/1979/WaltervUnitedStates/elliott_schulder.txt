mr.
elliott
schulder
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
first
to
respond
to
some
of
the
factual
questions
from
the
bench
and
some
of
the
statements
by
counsel
concerning
the
facts
of
this
case.
first
of
all,
chief
justice
burger
asked
when
petitioners
actually
discovered
that
the
fbi
had
the
films.
on
pages
8
and
9
of
our
brief,
we
refer
to
the
record
wherein
we
state
that
about
two
to
three
weeks
after
the
transfer
of
the
films
from
l'eggs
hosiery
company
to
the
fbi,
codefendant
grassi
--
michael
grassi
called
the
l'eggs
company
and
discovered
that
the
films
had
been
transferred
to
fbi.
the
record
also
shows
that
grassi
then
informed
petitioners,
walter
and
sanders
that
the
films
were
in
the
fbi's
possession.
furthermore,
i
believe
petitioner
sanders
testified
or
there
was
a
testimony
to
the
effect
that
petitioner
sanders
informed
the
--
his
employees
to
destroy
any
bills
of
lading
or
other
documents
that
would
connect
him
or
the
corporations
to
these
films.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
powell's
question
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
that
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
argument
is
that
petitioners
essentially
relinquished
or
abandoned
any
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
shipment
of
films.
but
we
don't
–
we
don't
seek
to
--
to
use
their
destruction
of
the
bills
of
lading
or
other
documents
to
support
that
because
that
occurred
after
the
films
were
transferred
to
the
government.
mr.
justice
powell
asked
whether
there
was
any
--
any
evidence
that
petitioners
made
a
conscious
decision
not
to
demand
the
films
from
the
fbi.
well,
there
may
not
be
testimony
to
that
effect,
but
i
believe
the
record
of
the
suppression
hearing
indicates
that
petitioner
sander's
attorney,
mr.
zell,
candidly
explained
to
the
district
court
that
the
reason
that
petitioner
did
not
come
forward
to
claim
the
films
was
that
he
did
not
want
to
identify
himself
to
the
government
and
connect
himself
with
these
films.
so
that
it
seems
clear
that
the
failure
to
request
an
adversary
hearing
rests
entirely
on
petitioners.
they
had
actual
notice
that
the
government
had
the
films.
and
yet
they
didn't
come
forward
and
make
any
request
either
for
return
of
the
property
or
for
an
adversary
judicial
determination
of
obscenity.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
believe
--
i
believe
that
the
first
amendment
would
not
have
required
the
government
to
do
anything.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
believe
so,
unless
there
was
a
request
for
their
return
by
someone
who
had
a
proprietary
relationship.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
not
necessarily.
but
the
government
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
so
you
could
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
government
kept
the
films
as
evidence
in
the
criminal
investigation
and
prosecution.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
possible
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--
your
honor.
i
don't
really
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
assume
so.
i
don't
really
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
what
occurred
in
this
case
was
the
government
did
--
did
prosecute
and
initiate
charges.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i
assume
unless
a
claim
has
been
made
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
assume
that
unless
a
claim
had
made
for
these
goods,
the
government
could
--
could
have
either
kept
it
or
used
it
as
evidence
to
initiate
a
prosecution.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
there
was
no
claim
made
until
after
indictment.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
suppression
issue
that
--
that's
been
raised.
as
far
as
the
other
issues,
we've
divided
the
questions
in
this
case
into
two
general
categories
for
purposes
of
convenience.
the
first
deals
with
the
question
whether
petitioners
may
seek
suppression
of
the
films
because
of
alleged
violations
of
the
fourth
and
first
amendments.
and
the
second
category
of
issues
we
place
within
the
district
court's
conduct
of
the
trial
referring
to
the
jury
instructions,
jury
voir
dire,
the
scienter
issue.
and
as
to
these
latter
issues
we
essentially
rely
on
our
brief.
we
begin
with
the
fourth
amendment
claims
that
were
raised
by
petitioners.
they
argue
that
the
acquisition
of
the
films
from
l'eggs
and
the
subsequent
inspection
of
the
films
by
the
government,
violated
their
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
require
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case.
at
the
outset,
we
would
like
to
note
that
only
the
individual
petitioners
here
walter
and
sanders
may
properly
raise
this
issue
before
the
court.
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
the
corporate
petitioners,
that
is
trans
world
america
and
gulf
coast
news,
never
moved
for
suppression
of
these
films
from
evidence
in
the
district
court.
they
therefore,
waived
any
right
to
suppression
under
rule
12
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
and
we
submit
that
they're
foreclosed
from
raising
the
suppression
issue
here.
at
least
since
this
court's
decision
in
katz
versus
united
states,
the
touchstone
of
the
court's
analysis
in
the
fourth
amendment
area
has
been
whether
an
individual's
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
has
been
invaded
by
an
unreasonable
governmental
intrusion.
a
recurrent
theme
of
our
fourth
amendment
analysis
in
this
case
is
that
petitioners
walter
and
sanders
did
not
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
with
respect
to
the
packages
of
films.
what
actually
occurred
here
was
that
petitioners
used
a
common
carrier
to
ship
a
large
quantity
of
pornographic
films
across
state
lines,
using
fictitious
names
for
both
the
shipper
and
the
consignee
and
giving
a
false
address
for
the
shipper
and
no
address
for
the
consignee.
under
these
circumstances,
we
submit,
petitioners
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
shipment
might
inadvertently
come
into
the
possession
of
an
innocent
third
party.
in
this
case
a
legitimate
business,
the
l'eggs
hosiery
company.
it
was
also
foreseeable
and
petitioners
assumed
the
risk
that
once
l'eggs
inspected
the
contents
of
the
packages,
they
would
contact
law
enforcement
authorities
and
on
its
own
and
on
their
own
initiative,
turn
the
shipment
over
to
the
government
for
possible
prosecution.
the
fact
that
petitioners
may
have
retained
the
property
interest
in
these
goods,
does
not
affect
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
in
this
particular
case,
because
we
submit,
they
had
no
legitimate
expectation
with
risk
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
films.
now,
it
may
be
that
if
petitioners
had
chosen
to
possess
these
films
at
home
and
to
view
them,
they
would
be
protected
from
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
if
they
had
them
in
a
commercial
establishment
for
sale,
they
would
know
--
there
would
be
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
the
film
as
necessarily.
as
--
after
all
as
mr.
justice
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
oh,
clearly
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
clearly,
the
government
could
not
seize
the
films
from
a
commercial
establishment
without
a
warrant
issued
by
a
neutral
magistrate
and
a
subsequent
determination
at
the
request
of
the
bookstore
or
establishment
owner
for
determination
of
obscenity
under
the
heller
case.
but
as
far
as
any
claim
of
privacy
is
concerned
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
films,
we
don't
see
that
there's
any
special
privacy
claim
simply
because
they
may
argue
with
the
first
amendment
protection
involved
here.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
part
of
their
first
amendment
argument
is
based
on
the
first
amendment,
but
we
submit
that
before
you
even
analyze
the
case
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment
and
--
and
fourth
amendment
interplay,
you
first
have
to
make
a
determination
whether
the
fourth
amendment
applies
at
all.
we
don't
--
we
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
for
a
locked
trunk,
we
would
be
in
a
situation
very
similar
to
chadwick
and
sanders
situation.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
it
--
it
was
clear
from
the
exteriors
of
the
individual
film
cartons
what
the
films
in
fact
depicted.
the
cartons
gave
graphic
and
detailed
descriptions
of
the
actions
portrayed
in
the
films.
so
that
clearly,
you
could
tell
by
looking
at
the
cartons
themselves,
what
--
what
was
inside
the
carton.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
submit
that
the
screening
itself
did
not
amount
to
a
search,
simply
because
there
was
no
longer
any
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
contents.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
not
--
not
exactly.
we're
not
making
the
claim
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we're
not
making
the
claim
that
the
--
the
contents
or
the
descriptions
on
the
boxes
gave
the
government
probable
cause
to
believe
the
films
were
obscene
and
to
hold
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
argument
is
not
probable
cause,
but
it's
a
lack
of
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
the
films.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no.
we're
not
saying
that
at
all.
it's
–
it
would
–
it's
as
if
in
this
--
it's
the
same
--
the
same
argument
would
be
made,
if
we
had
a
transparent
plastic
bag
containing
white
powder
which
the
police
suspected
were
drugs.
we
submit
that
there
would
be
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
when
the
contents
of
that
bag
and
that
the
police
would
not
need
a
warrant
to
open
the
bag,
inspect
the
contents
and
perhaps
test
the
contents
in
the
laboratory.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
our
submission
is
that
the
25
that
--
that
were
retained
would
still
be
admissible
in
evidence.
as
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
perhaps.
mr.
elliott
schulder
--
but
that
should
not
affect
the
right
of
the
government
to
go
ahead
with
a
criminal
prosecution.
the
courts
of
appeals
are
unanimous
in
holding
that
a
--
any
prior
restraint
by
the
government
in
holding
on
to
films
without
obtaining
an
adversary
proceeding
with
respect
to
obscenity
does
not
require
suppression
of
films
from
evidence
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
mr.
justice
white,
we
don't
rely
on
the
plain
view
doctrine
to
justify
the
government's
acquisition
of
the
films
from
l'eggs.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
our
submission
as
far
as
keeping
the
films
is
that
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
suppose
that
the
government
may
have
--
if
--
if
the
government
were
able
to
discover
the
true
owners
of
the
films
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--
the
government
would
have
returned
them.
mr.
elliott
schulder
in
assumption
of
those
charges
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
--
we
have
no
specific
authority
with
respect
to
precisely
this
type
of
situation,
but
we
have
analogized
in
our
brief
the
other
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--
situation
such
as
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
as
--
as
i
said
in
addressing
mr.
justice
white's
questions,
i'm
not
sure
that
probable
cause
is
really
the
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--
determining
factor
here.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
our
submission
is
that
once
the
container
clearly
demonstrates
or
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
not
exactly
what
we're
saying.
in
fact
we
--
we
state
in
our
brief
that
if
--
we
discussed
that
chadwick
and
sanders
cases,
if
there
clearly
in
chadwick
and
sanders
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
luggage
in
those
cases
contained
marijuana
--
at
least
in
chadwick
the
dog
sniffing
out
the
suitcase
gave
a
clear
indication
to
the
agents
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
there
--
there
are
two
related
--
i've
strains
to
what
we're
saying
here.
the
first
is
that
film
cartons
generally
are
not
like
luggage
--
not
like
a
closed
foot
locker
in
chadwick
or
a
suitcase
in
sanders.
they're
not
ordinarily
repositories
for
personal
effects.
and
second
the
exteriors
of
these
particular
containers
indicated
clearly
just
as
if
they
had
been
transparent
bag
showing
what
was
inside,
what
exactly
was
contained
within
the
containers.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i'm
not
really
certain
what
the
answer
is.
and
we're
not
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
has
a
footnote.
mr.
elliott
schulder
we
don't
believe
so.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
except
that
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
description
gave
probable
cause
or
perhaps
more
than
probable
cause
as
to
what
was
contained
inside
of
these
film
cartons.
mr.
elliott
schulder
not
necessarily.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
--
which
containers
are
you
talking
about?
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
have
two
--
two
types
of
containers.
we
have
the
packages
in
which
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--
the
individual
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
okay.
we
submit
that
the
consent
of
--
of
these
petitioners
is
irrelevant
in
terms
of
you
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
if
they
did
consent
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
--
the
other
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
sure.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes,
we
do.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
but
your
question
had
to
do
with
the
viewing
of
the
film.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
not
at
all.
the
viewing
may
have
proceeded
in
this
case.
the
time
it
--
period
though
at
which
the
petitioners
actually
received
notice
that
the
government
had
possession
of
the
films,
but
we
would
argue
certainly
that
--
that
once
they
did
have
notice
and
they
didn't
come
forward
and
--
and
request
the
films
or
claim
them,
they
in
effect
did
consent
to
the
government's
keeping
them
or
--
or
putting
in
another
way,
they
--
they
abandoned
or
relinquished
their
interest
in
the
films
to
that
stand.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
believe
so.
mr.
elliott
schulder
certainly.
mr.
elliott
schulder
in
our
view,
yes.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
this
--
the
--
the
exterior
of
the
carton
itself
provides
ample
probable
cause
--
ample
basis.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i
don't
want
–
i
don't
want
to
take
that
position
because
the
court
explicitly
rejected
it
in
chadwick.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
don't
think
so.
as
i
was
trying
to
say
earlier,
in
chadwick,
the
exteriors
of
the
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
because
when
--
when
the
person
places
his
items
within
that
container
and
writes
on
the
outside
what
the
container
actually
contains,
he
is
in
effect,
opening
up
the
container
to
anyone
who
wants
to
look
at
the
contents.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
but
it
has
to
be
--
there
has
to
be
a
clear
enough
indication
that
the
person
is
retaining
some
kind
of
privacy
interest
in
the
contents
of
the
package
or
container.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
question
is
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
indication
that
he
wished
to
retain
a
privacy
interest
in
your
hypothetical.
and
in
our
case,
we
submit
there
--
there
clearly
was
no
--
no
such
indication.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct
and
i
believe
counsel
for
one
of
petitioners
has
indicated
that
the
descriptions
were
in
fact
accurate
--
accurate
in
terms
of
what
actions
were
portrayed
on
the
films.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
submit
though
that
by
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
but
here,
the
information
that
gave
the
agents
probable
cause
was
placed
either
by
petitioners
or
it
was
left
by
petitioners
on
the
outside
of
the
container.
mr.
elliott
schulder
and
by
that
we
submit
by
doing
that
--
by
allowing
these
films
to
be
shipped
with
that
explicit
description
on
the
covers
they
in
effect,
abandoned
any
privacy
interest
in
the
--
in
the
contents
of
the
individual
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
certainly.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
they
didn't
claim
the
film
until
after
they
were
indicted.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
so
far
as
the
government
knew
prior
to
--
to
the
indictment
or
prior
to
the
motion
to
suppress,
by
all
appearances,
it
--
it
did
seem
as
if
they'd
--
they
had
abandoned
any
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well
that
was
nearly
two
years
between
the
initial
shipment
and
the
actual
trial
itself.
there
were
almost
20
months
between
the
time
that
petitioners
discovered
that
the
government
had
possession
of
the
films
and
the
time
they
actually
made
any
kind
of
request
for
either
return
of
the
films
or
an
adversary
hearing.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
judge
did
not
make
a
determination
on
the
obscenity
question
in
that
--
in
that
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
what
happened
was
the
suppression
at
hearing
concluded
the
day
before
trial
and
the
district
court
stated
on
the
record
that
since
the
court
didn't
believe
that
there
was
any
prior
restraint
here,
since
there
was
no
evidence
that
petitioners
didn't
have
other
copies
of
the
films
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
the
films
were
being
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
there
were
871,
which
we
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
there
25
different
titles
and
so
most
of
them
were
in
fact
duplicates.
but
what
the
district
court
did
was
it
decided
that
since
the
trial
was
to
commence
the
following
day,
it
would
await
the
trial
before
any
determination
of
obscenity
would
take
place.
and
petitioners,
so
far
as
i
believe
the
record
shows,
did
not
make
any
objection
to
that
disposition.
thank
you.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
indictment
charged
five.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes,
sir.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no.
thank
you.
mr.
elliott
schulder
what
was
contained
on
the
box
covers
was
to
be
viewed
by
potential
customers.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
was.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
suppose
like
anything
else
--
like
the
expression,
“you
can't
judge
a
book
by
its
cover.”
i
think
the
film
would
have
to
speak
for
itself
as
to
whether
it
was
an
overstatement
or
understatement.
some
may
be
and
some
might
not
be.
what
i
would
like
to
address
very
briefly
is
the
issue
of
the
implied
consent.
suggest
that
the
record
bears
ample
evidence
that
the
petitioners
herein
exercised
every
reasonable
means
to
try
to
retrieve
the
particular
films
as
soon
as
they
discovered
they
had
been
misdirected.
first
of
all
as
far
as
their
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
relationship
to
this,
i
must
say
that
what
we
have
is
this
a
situation
analogous
to
one
sending
a
letter
to
oneself
in
that
the
same
individuals
are
the
consignor
and
the
consignee
in
this
particular
situation.
that
they
wrapped
the
boxes
very
carefully,
that
they
had
made
previous
shipments
using
the
same
name
l'eggs
inc.,
that
they
had
no
reason
to
expect
that
a
person
who
one
claimed
no
entitlement
to
the
shipment
itself.
second,
refused
to
pay
for
it
and
so
indicated
as
the
testimony
of
mr.
fox
from
l'eggs
products,
inc.
indicates,
moreover,
i
would
suggest
that
l'eggs
products
indicated
that
this
was
a
rather
unusual
shipment.
then
we
have
a
five-day
hiatus
between
the
friday
when
the
shipment
is
misdelivered
to
the
wednesday
when
the
fbi
finally
stops
by
l'eggs
products
and
picks
them
up.
during
the
intervening
time,
people
from
the
petitioners'
offices
have
gone
to
the
various
terminuses
of
greyhound
both
the
originating
and
ending
terminus.
they
have
made
contact
with
individuals
trying
to
run
down
the
packages.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
i
believe,
is
what
the
record
reflects,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
also
evidence
on
the
record
indicating
that
the
fbi
was
the
one,
in
fact,
supervising
the
activity
that
occurred
in
that
they
were
telling
people
such
as
mr.
askew
at
the
greyhound
terminals
to
find
out
the
names
and
addresses
of
these
people.
that
they
were
advising
people
at
l'eggs
products,
inc.
not
to
tell
the
defendants
in
this
case
that
in
fact
the
fbi
had
acquired
possession
of
the
property.
and
so,
in
some
i
think,
what
we
have
is
a
just
a
situation
presenting
an
earnest,
good
faith
attempt
by
the
petitioners
to
try
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--
to
get
their
property
back.
mr.
elliott
schulder
approximately
two
years
after
it
was
taken
from
them
--
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
case.
i
think,
perhaps
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
situation
was
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
perhaps
lack
of
interest
in
being
prosecuted
for
[laughs]
what
turned
out
to
be
a
--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--
a
federal
case.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
don't
know
if
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
it
was
abandoned?
mr.
elliott
schulder
to
the
extent
that
until
such
time,
i
guess,
is
a
prosecution
was
initiated
it
would
be
unclaimed.
mr.
elliott
schulder
they
were
not.
i
think
that's
a
misstatement.
i
looked
particularly
in
the
record
in
the
parts
cited
by
government.
i
couldn't
find
anything
reflecting
that
the
bills
of
lading
had
been
destroyed.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
is
correct.
what
i
would
suggest
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
clear
situation
involving
a
prior
restraint
where
that
--
the
burden
is
attempted
to
be
placed
upon
the
petitioners
to
demand
property
which
they
have
been
dispossessed
and
that
all
notions
of
procedural
due
process
would
indicate
that
that
was
inappropriate
under
these
circumstances.
thank
you.
