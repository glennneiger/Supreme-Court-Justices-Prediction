mr.
glenn
zell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
certiorari
from
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
involving
a
conviction
of
two
--
the
two
petitioners
and
two
corporations
for
distribution
of
obscene
materials
in
interstate
commerce.
the
issues
that
i
will
argue
this
morning
involve
search
and
seizure.
to
outline
the
facts
very
quickly,
the
fbi
was
called
to
l'eggs
company,
it's
a
stocking
manufacturer.
they'd
received
several
boxes
of
films
misdirected
to
them
by
greyhound
bus
terminal.
upon
opening
the
boxes
by
the
l'eggs
company,
they
discovered
they
were
not
stockings,
but
films,
871
and
25
different
specific
kinds
of
films.
they
called
the
fbi.
the
fbi
came
out.
mr.
mandyk
i
think
his
name
is,
told
them
to
hold
it
for
him,
came
back
in
five
days
and
seized
the
entire
shipment,
took
it
to
the
fbi
office.
thereafter,
two
months
later,
he
viewed
them
in
the
office.
approximately
two
years
from
the
initial
seizure,
the
petitioners
went
to
trial.
no
notification
either
by
publication
or
directly,
was
given
the
petitioners,
no
warrant
was
ever
gotten.
and
of
course,
during
the
trial,
the
district
court
overruled
the
motion
to
suppress
based
on
several
grounds.
the
conviction
--
the
jury
found
the
films
obscene,
found
that
petitioner
is
guilty,
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit.
there
was
a
strong
dissent
by
judge
wisdom,
which
laid
out
our
issues
very
clearly
and
succinctly
and
thereafter,
we
filed
a
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
your
honor,
in
the
transcript,
it
appears
that
there
was
some
information
conveyed
by
one
of
the
employees,
mr.
grassi
to
mr.
sanders
about
a
month
or
several
days
or
several
weeks
after
the
initial
seizure
or
after
the
fbi
seized
them.
just
in
hearsay,
and
he
said
they
heard
or
that
was
turned
over
to
the
fbi,
but
they
weren't
sure,
there's
no
date
in
the
record,
and
it
was
not
verified
or
didn't
know
where
to
go,
what
to
do
and
he
turned
over
to
his
lawyer,
which,
of
course,
was
me,
at
that
time.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
he
did
not.
we
didn't
know
where
they
were.
mr.
--
mr.
walter
testified,
he
didn't
know
where
they
were
himself,
he
wasn't
sure,
he
was
never
directly
told.
(inaudible)
was
just
told
in
hearsay
that
the
fbi
might
have
had
them.
he
--
we
never
heard
anything
from
the
fbi
until,
of
course,
the
indictment.
when
the
grand
jury
met,
we
were
notified,
and
at
that
time,
of
course,
we
filled
a
motion
to
return
the
property.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
can
see
it
as
a
--
a
trial
attorney
that
it's
a
factual
disposition
to
the
jury.
we
litigated
the
case.
we
presented
several
expert
witnesses,
and
the
jury
after
being
out
over
a
day,
found
against
us
on
that
issue
apparently.
so,
we
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
obscenity
in
this
case,
not
that
we
concede
or
agree
with
the
jury
verdict,
but
we
argued
it,
we
fought
it,
it
was
a
factual
determination,
and
i
think
that's
--
that
--
that
rest
that
issue,
i
think,
in
this
particular
case,
as
far
as
it
goes.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
on
the
box
it
said,
“we'll
call.”
and
there
was
a
clear
--
and
they
hold
it
at
the
greyhound
terminal.
the
reason
for
this
is
not
that
they
were
giving
up
their
right
of
privacy
as
the
fifth
circuit
alleged
or
argued,
and
the
district
court
found
was
that
they
--
in
the
testimony
in
the
record
from
walters
and
sanders,
that
they
had
repeated
shipments
being
stolen
and
missing.
apparently,
whenever
a
--
the
greyhound
bus
terminal
men
sees
the
name
of
the
sender
or
gets
used
to
it,
where
it's
going
at
a
certain
terminal
warehouse,
apparently,
he's
broken
into
and
the
--
and
the
shipment
is
taken
or
parts
are
taken
out
of
it.
it
might
point
out
in
u.s.
versus
kelly,
it
was
the
same
problem.
i
think
his
last
seven
shipments
had
been
missing
or
misdirected.
apparently,
the
workers-employees
at
these
common
carriers
get
used
to
what
the
shipments
are
about,
and
i
guess
it's
--
they've
decided
just
pilfer
for
them.
so
because
of
that
problem,
we
didn't
put
the
name
of
the
sender
or
the
--
who
would
pick
it
up
the
name
because
we
felt
the
employees
would
find
out
about
at
the
common
carrier.
and
that's
been
done
as
--
on
a
regular
basis.
it
had
been
done
before
with
no
problem.
many
people
travel.
movie
stars
under
assumed
names,
not
that
they
give
it
the
right
of
privacy,
because
they
want
privacy.
and
that's
the
reason
why
it
was
done.
mr.
glenn
zell
no.
no,
that
happened
to
be
the
nickname
of
the
girl
who
was
the
manager
of
the
warehouse
in
atlanta
where
the
shipment
was
destined
for.
she's
very
tall
girl,
and
that's
where
the
nickname
came
from.
[laughter]
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
for
this
reason.
apparently,
the
fifth
circuit
and
this
court
ruled
in
the
burdeau
case
versus
mcdowell
about
a
third
party.
that's
true
in
contraband
cases,
involving
marijuana,
sawed-off
shotguns.
but
here,
you
have
presumptively
protected
materials,
reels
of
film
that
never
been
termed
to
be
obscene.
they're
perfectly
legal
at
that
point.
now,
the
l'eggs
company
decides
that
they're
not
in
that
business,
it's
not
theirs.
they
don't
have
authority
to
consent
to
give
it
anyone.
they
should
return
to
the
common
carrier,
they're
perfectly
legal
materials,
they're
not
contraband,
because
third
party
consent
equates
with
plain
view.
it's
contraband,
you
see
it
and
you
take
it,
whether
it
be
drugs
or
stolen
goods
or
sawed-off
shotgun,
but
here
you
have
films.
so,
the
fbi
had
no
right
to
take
it,
in
order
to
seize
it.
they
would
steal
the
property
of
the
sender.
and
all
they
could
have
done
and
should
have
done
was
when
they
saw
the
films
and
looked
at
the
boxes,
is
they
went
to
a
magistrate
to
get
a
warrant
to
seize
these
films.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
would
agree
with
that
also.
either
way,
they
certainly
weren't
the
property
of
l'eggs
company
and
l'eggs
company
didn't
even
have
the
authority
to
give
it
to
the
fbi.
that
was
perfectly
legal
property
such
as
other
magazines,
national
geographic
or
carnal
knowledge,
print
of
carnal
knowledge.
it
was
held
a
--
a
case
litigated
in
this
court
jenkins
versus
georgia.
as
far
as
the
fbi
was
concerned,
those
were
legal
materials
and
then
they
took
them.
that
was,
in
our
opinion,
we
argue
a
seizure.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
probably
not
because
you
don't
have
the
first
amendment
issue
involved,
which
is
--
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
the
--
the
goods
are
--
are
stolen.
they're
not
presumptively
protected.
they're
not
stolen
as
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
these
films
are.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
and
well,
i
would
still
argue
that
--
that
they
had
nowhere
to
keep
them,
the
fbi.
they
either
should've
published
by
publication
or
attempting
to
notify
the
sender
or
the
shipper.
they
would
turn
it
to
the
common
carrier
and
easily
found
out
because
people
--
the
record
shows
people
came
by
and
asked
for
it.
where
was
it?
can
we
pick
it
up?
and
you've
got
871
films
and
the
fbi
just
sitting
on
them,
involving
25
different
prints.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
indictment,
they
only
indicted
on
five
films.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
because
--
well
as
a
third
party,
i
wouldn't
consider
that
it's
seizure
under
those
facts.
but
under
the
facts,
we
have
presumptively
protected
materials
and
you
have
strict
procedure
requirements
under
heller
and
roaden,
that
would
become
a
seizure.
the
first
amendment
is
a
fundamental
amendment
and
to
allow
the
fbi
to
sit
on
such
a
massive
amount
of
material
without
going
to
a
magistrate,
i
think,
is
a
danger
in
a
free
society.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
procedural
sequence
requires
that.
they
don't
need
871
films
--
mr.
glenn
zell
--
and
20
different
kinds.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
if
they
had
been
properly
notified,
went
to
a
magistrate
to
determine
they're
obscene
so
they
could
keep
them,
if
they
had
then
returned
the
films
they
didn't
need
and
kept
the
only
ones
that
they
felt
were
obscene,
of
course
that
that's
what
i
think
as
i
understand
it,
your
procedural
safeguards
the
you've
set
on
your
opinions
require
--
in
the
sherwin
case
for
example,
we
--
that
the
fifth
circuit
cites
the
majority
opinion.
there,
the
agents
saw
two
magazines.
they
didn't
take
the
shipment
or
--
they
took
it
to
there
office,
they
immediately
went
and
got
a
warrant,
there
was
very
limited
if
any,
prior
restraint.
they
came
back
with
a
warrant.
now,
in
kelly,
they
held
it
was
this
seizure
from
the
common
carrier,
because
there
was
a
--
it
was
a
seizure,
it
was
first
amendment
protecting
materials
and
there
was
no
procedural
safeguards
involved.
i
think
you
read
the
first
and
the
fourth
together.
i
think
it's
a
dangerous
thing
to
allow
this
to
happen.
and
--
and
as
i
point
out
in
the
indictment,
there
was
only
five
films
alleged
to
be
obscene,
20
were
not
even
alleged
to
be
obscene.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
we
weren't
sure
--
the
client
said
these
weren't
sure.
mr.
glenn
zell
theoretically,
if
they
--
they
could've
demanded
them,
they
could
have
after
when
they
found
out
it
maybe
a
month
later
--
mr.
glenn
zell
the
--
we
weren't
sure,
we
weren't
sure
where
the
films,
where
we
shoot.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
know
about
pretty
good
idea.
we
--
we
did
know
where.
we
thought
they
have
been
stolen
first
or
at
least
my
clients
did,
because
they
were
used
to
pilferage.
then
they
were
told
it
was
the
fbi.
mr.
glenn
zell
no.
to
answer
your
question,
no,
they
did
not
after
or
about
a
month
or
two
they'd
--
they
thought
it
would
turn
out
that
some
litigation
or
--
or
it
was
just
lost.
usually,
the
clients
take
a
negative
act
because
of
so
much
stealing
and
why
use
these
fictitious
names
is
that
it's
been
--
it's
been
stolen.
that
was
their
general
attitude.
it
happens
so
often
before.
we
just
taken
and
get
used
to
that
occurrence
as
in
kelly
where
they
point
out
seven
of
l'eggs
shipments
have
been
stolen.
they
just
assume
that
it
was
stolen.
didn't
take
it
seriously,
of
whatever
reason,
of
course,
i
don't
know
what's
in
their
minds,
but
we
thought
they
were
just
gone.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
frivolous.
that
argument
--
i
think
this
court
has
already
decided
that
--
about
protecting
at
the
militia,
that
i
think
they've
decided
on
the
case,
i
think
it
was
miller
versus
united
states.
you've
already
allowed
gun
laws
and
statutes
to
regulate
different
type
of
weapon
so
i
find
that
argument,
this
was
analogous
and
also
it's
been
decided
by
this
court
very
clearly
that
the
--
arms
can
be
regulated
by
the
state
and
federal
governments.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
in
particularly
where
you
have
the
first
amendment
in
expressing
materials,
in
particular
whether
it
entirely
suppressed
completely.
mr.
glenn
zell
well
it's
the
first
amendment.
but
no,
i
think
--
i
think
in
a
free
society,
ideas,
communication
is
fundamental
--
so
fundamental.
and
the
right
to
bare
arms
involves
i
think,
a
militia
and
i
don't
--
i
--
i
feel
it's
a
--
the
government
has
the
right
to
regulate
weapons,
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
it,
these
courts
decided.
not
only
in
this
--
in
this
court,
but
in
the
state
of
georgia
decided
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
so
there's
no
problem
with
that.
then
--
then
they
view
the
films
two
months
later.
there's
no
continuing
search
why
did
they
get
a
warrant
at
that
time?
two
months
later,
they've
looked
at
the
covers
all
can
see
for
argument
purposes,
they
have
probable
cause.
why
did
they
get
a
search
warrant
then?
it's
like
the
case
of
michigan
versus
tyler,
the
fire
case.
that
police
run
the
property,
then
later
on,
they
came
and
they
said
let's
go
back
again
and
search
it.
this
court
held
a
separate
search.
so
even
if
you
assume
it
was
not
a
seizure
going
a
month
or
two
months
later,
would
have
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant,
they
don't
do
it.
that
is
certainly
a
search
of
the
films
and
they
didn't
do
it.
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances.
clearly
as
in
the
haes
case
we
cite
in
our
brief,
i
think
it
was
in
the
eighth
circuit.
they
held
to
view
the
films
was
a
search
and
clearly
the
fbi
could
have
got
a
warrant
at
that
point.
and
then
we,
of
course,
analogize
this
to
the
arkansas
versus
sanders
and
chadwick
versus
united
states.
luggage,
boxes,
compartments,
here
was
a
compartment,
871
of
them.
there's
probable
cause
that
they
may
be
obscene.
why
would
they
require
a
warrant
as
you
did
on
chadwick
and
sanders?
mr.
glenn
zell
i've
no
question
in
mind.
they
would've
been
sold
and
distributed
in
atlanta.
mr.
glenn
zell
well
in
the
--
mr.
glenn
zell
they
--
mr.
glenn
zell
--
they
would
be
distributed
yes,
they
would
be
shown.
mr.
glenn
zell
purchased
--
mr.
glenn
zell
no.
these
were
8-millimeter
reels.
apparently,
the
courts
are
not
familiar
with
them
and
they're
purchased
by
a
customer
and
taken
out
of
the
store.
they're
only
200
feet
long
with
thereabouts.
and
you
go
in
the
store
and
purchase
them
and
take
them
to
your
home
or
wherever
to
view
them.
mr.
glenn
zell
[laughs]
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
here
--
again
you
must
read
the
first
and
fourth
amendment
together.
they
are
keeping
the
films.
they
want
to
look
at
them.
shouldn't
they
get
--
mr.
glenn
zell
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
they
--
well
[laughs]
mr.
glenn
zell
i
guess
they
would
want
--
not
in
the
--
not
particularly,
no.
they
want
to
sell
them.
i
realized
what
you're
saying,
but
all
we're
only
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
but
--
but
they're
keeping
them.
they
want
to
keep
them.
they're
not
for
the
fbi,
they
want
to
seize
them.
and
if
you
want
to
seize
them
after
looking
at
them
and
--
and
searching
must
i
--
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
my
clients,
of
course,
in
the
store,
they're
not

they
must
buy
them
first
before
they're

yes.
mr.

and

and
they're

and

and
you
must
buy
the
film
before
you
could
view
it.
and
in
this
case,
the
fbi,
of
course,
just
took
them
we'd
say,
illegally
then
further
viewed
them
illegally.
they
have
no
right,
they
didn't
purchase
them.
they

if
they
want
to
view
them
to
--
for
purpose
of
prosecution,
i
think
they
should
get
a
warrant.
it's
like
a
seizure,
it's
like
you
go
in
the
store
and
you
took
the
film
off
the
counter
without
paying
for
it
and
decided
to
look
at
it.
that
would
be
in
a
sense
certainly
a
search
and
then
seizure
as
well.
