mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
the
--
did
your
clients
first
to
learn
what
the
fbi
had
taken
possession
of
the
films?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
your
client
ask
for
the
return
of
the
films?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
do
you
say
they
were
the
property
of
the
sender,
why
not
the
property
of
the
consignee
the
recipient?
chief

e.
burger
(voice

well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
change
slightly
mr.
justice
stewart's
hypothetical
theory.
suppose
they
had
been
pilfered,
as
he
suggested,
by
thieves
in
transit
and
then
rather
than
having
the
thieves
turn
--
them
over
to
the
fbi,
the
thieves
catch
the
--
the
fbi
catch
these
thieves
for
some
other
matter
and
find
them
in
possession
of
this
material.
do
you
say
that's
a
seizure
by
the
fbi?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
position
be
different
if
the
fbi
had
to
kept
the
25
samples
or
the
five
and
turn
all
the
others
over
to
your
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
--
you
say
then
you
wouldn't
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
made
a
point
of
distinction
between
films
and
firearms
sawed-off
shotguns.
could
many
people
think
the
constitution,
there
was
a
presumptive
constitutional
protection
to
bare
arms
was
this
not
--
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
in
each
case,
it's
--
it's
a
presumptive
protection
with
one
little
presumption
that
can
be
overcome.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
--
you
make
that
higher
than
the
right
to
bare
arms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mayock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
mayock.
mr.
schulder.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
--
do
you
suggest
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
constructive
abandonment

warren
e.
burger
--
as
--
as
on
the
basis
of

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
they
not
be
subject
to
an
action
and
conversion
if
the
petitioners
had
wanted
to
bring
such
an
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
or
taking
the
property
without
compensation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
there
ever
a
claim
made
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
–
suppose
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
government
should've
returned
all,
but
25
samples
as
was
intimated,
i
think,
in
heller.what
effect
would
that
have
on
the
25
that
were
retained?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

the
government
might
be
subject
to
some
kind
of
a
civil

the
court
of

opinion,
the
descriptions
that
were
found?
chief

warren
e.
burger
and
could
that
leave
anyone
in
doubt
--
anyone
in
doubt
of
the
pornographic
nature
of
the
materials?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
wasn't
that
the
answer
to
the
question
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
the
–
that
the
description
gave
probable
cause
--
the
description
prepared
by
the
petitioners
of
their
own
materials,
gave
probable
cause
in
abundance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
these
–
these
descriptions
on
these
films
went
considerably
beyond
simply
saying
these
are
guns
purchased.
they
--
they
were
explicit
in
describing
the
actual
content
of
the
film
if

structured

recited
them
in
the
footnotes.

more
than
a
year

such
as
the
time

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

in
the
footnote

in
your
appendix,
is
that
the
material
that
would
be
made
available
to
the
customers
on

to
induce
them
to
buy

warren
e.
burger
this
was
the

this
was
the,
come
on,
did
they
get
them
interested
in
the
contents
of
the
package?
chief
