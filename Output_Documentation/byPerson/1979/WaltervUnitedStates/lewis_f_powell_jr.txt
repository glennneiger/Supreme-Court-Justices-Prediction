mr.
zell
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
you
said
that
you
had
--
through
hearsay
that
these
films
were
in
the
possession
of
the
fbi,
why,
as
a
practical
matter,
didn't
you
demand
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
have
been
any
difficulty
to
demand
them
even
if
he
was
sure?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
make
--
did
you
make
a
conscious
decision
not
to
demand
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you
--
you
had
a
pretty
good
idea
where
they
were.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
make
any
effort
to
locate
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
may
i
ask
this
question?
we
know
these
close
and
difficult
fourth
amendment
questions
evaporate
if
the
government
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
respondents
or
the
petitioners
here
had
consented
that
--
to
the
fbi
keeping
the
film
and
looking
at
them?
if
--
if
the
petitioners
had
been
standing
beside
an
fbi
agent
and
said
nothing
when
he
opened
the
packages
and
looked
at
the
film
would
that
constitute
consent?
may
you
infer
the
consent
existed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
not?
would
you
stand
by
and
allow
somebody
to
open
something
in
which
you
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
and
say
nothing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
anything
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
talking
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
i'm
talking
about
--
let's
say
viewing
the
film.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
--
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
make
that
concession?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
familiar
with
(inaudible)
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
don't
you
agree
that
consent
may
be
implied
as
well
as
expressed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
wonder
why
you
don't
argue
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
told
us
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
that
plaintiff's
--
petitioners
knew
the
fbi
had
the
film.
and
that
counsel
said
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
the
reason
they
hadn't
claimed
them
was
his
clients
didn't
want
to
get
implicated
into
this.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
would
apply
to
both
--
keeping
them
and
viewing
them.
is
it
unlikely
that
the
fbi
would
keep
them
without
viewing
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
well
the
short
answer
to
my
first
question
is
that
if
we
conclude
from
the
record
that
there
was
implied
consent.
one,
to
retaining
the
films
and
two,
to
viewing
them
that
answers
all
the
other
questions
doesn't
it?
