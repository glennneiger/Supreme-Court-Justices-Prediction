justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
the
--
you
don't
think
your
--
any
of
your
--
in
any
of
your
claims
of
error
subsume
a
--
a
claim
that
it
--
the
--
of
--
--
of
--
that
any
conviction
under
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is,
yes
--
no,
that
question
is
just
not
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
then
that
the
government
could
or
the
fbi
could
just
have
kept
the
films
and
never
done
anything
with
them?
they
weren't
--
didn't
belong
to
the
fbi
and
then
the
shipping
didn't
belong
to
the
l'eggs
company
from
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
where
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
ask
you
about
the
first
amendment
particularly.
i
just
said
in
general
could
the
--
was
the
united
states
entitled
to
keep
these
films?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
just
--
you
just
generally
or
rather
repository
for
unclaimed
goods
at
--
by
--
at
shipping
lines
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
where
they
came
from.
you
know
what
shipping
company
had
them,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
(inaudible)
what
business
--
was
it
yours
that
keep
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
after
you
thought
they
were
--
they
were
evidence,
after
you
had
looked
at
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
had
him
--
what
if
they
had
him
in
a
commercial
establishment
and
had
them
on
the
shelves
for
sale?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
until
you
–
until
you
had
a
proceeding
and
had
them
declared
to
be
obscene
and
finally
you
couldn't
take
out
of
circulation
all
copies
of
the
film.
you
couldn't
maybe
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
one
of
them.
maybe
you
could
have
one
of
them
for
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
part
of
the
suppression
argument
is
based
on
the
first
amendment
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
--
suppose
what
you
had
seized
from
l'eggs
or
what
--
or
that
you'd
taken
delivery
out
from
l'eggs
was
a
locked
trunk,
and
you
had
--
and
you
had
probable
cause
that
you
thought
to
believe
that
it
contained
obscene
films,
could
you
open
the
box
without
any
--
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
could
you
--
could
you
tell
what
these
films
were
without
screening
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
didn't
need
to
screen
them,
but
you
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
–
but
you
think
–
you
think
that
because
that
cartons
indicated
to
you
that
the
films
were
obscene
that
just
because
of
your
own
determination
without
submission
to
a
judge
or
anybody
else
you
were
entitled
to
hold
all
copies
of
the
--
of
the
films?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
your
exact
claim,
was
it
by
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
--
in
your
judgment
and
the
judgment
of
the
fbi.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
gave
you
probable
cause
to
keep
them,
to
--
to
believe
that
they
were
obscene,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
a
sort
of
a
plain
view
argument
that
you
just
had
the
--
what
was
obviously
or
what
you
gave
me
probably
cause
to
believe
was
a
--
was
obscene
material
in
violation
of
the
law
and
it
had
been
delivered
to
you
and
you
could
keep
it.
you
don't
think
that
the
case
is
any
different
than
if
you
--
just
because
of
the
first
amendment
is
involved
you
don't
think
it's
any
different
than
your
plastic
bag
and
--
and
drugs.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
--
i
know
that.
but
how
about
keeping
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
have
done
--
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
--
if
after
you
screened
the
film
it
turned
out
that
the
designations
on
the
box
were
completely
false?
supposing
that
you
have
screened
the
films
and
completely
innocent.
what
you
have
done
with
them?
just
put
in
the
basement
or
would
you
try
to
give
them
back
to
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hope
you
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
--
you
don't
--
you
certainly
don't
claim
that
they
abandoned
any
property
interest.
they
--
they
claimed
their
film
and
wanted
it
suppressed
and
wanted
it
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
i
say
is
they
didn't
abandon
their
property
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time
of
--
of
the
--
was
there
a
suppression
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
time,
did
--
did
the
judge
determine
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
the
films
were
obscene?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
ever
prior
to
conviction
any
judicial
--
any
searching
judicial
look
at
the
--
at
the
film?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
copies
did
you
have
in
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
constant
film
or
--
