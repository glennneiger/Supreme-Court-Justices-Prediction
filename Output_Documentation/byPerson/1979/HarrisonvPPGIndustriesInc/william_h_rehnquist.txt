justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
walsh,
do
you
agree
with
the
characterization
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
record
in
this
case
was
skeletal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
the
real
question
though
not
whether
it
was
sufficient
for
epa
to
make
the
determination
but
whether
it
was
sufficient
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
determine
whether
the
epa
had
acted
correctly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
one
of
your
arguments
is
that
you
want
to
speed
up
the
process
of
review
so
people
will
know
what
is
expected
of
them
under
the
epa.
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
remands
to
the
agency,
that
certainly
isn't
going
to
speed
up
the
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
had
read
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
and
its
use
of
the
word
"skeletal"
not
as
meaning
that
it
was
less
than
20
pages
or
less
than
15
pages,
but
skeletal
in
a
sense
that
it
was
simply
correspondence
largely
between
the
private
party
and
the
epa;
and
it
was
skeletal
for
purposes
of
review.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
none
between
'77
and
'76
either,
was
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
alternative
would
burden
the
district
courts
rather
than
the
courts
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
the
government's
reading
of
the
statute
where
it
concedes
the
court
of
appeals
can
remand,
couldn't
the
court
of
appeals
remand
for
similar
supplementation
of
the
agency
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
the
special
review
proceeding
depends
on
--
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
depends
on
an
ad
hoc
evaluation
of
the
record
but
that
the
likelihood
of
a
skeletal
record
is
why
you
apply
the
ejusdem
generis
construction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
each
decision
under
the
epa
by
the
district
court
is
appealable
to
the
court.
