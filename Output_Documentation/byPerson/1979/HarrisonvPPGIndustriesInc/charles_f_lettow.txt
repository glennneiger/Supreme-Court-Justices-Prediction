mr.
charles
f.
lettow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
disagree
directly
on
the
construction
given
the
other
final
action
catch
phrases
at
the
end
of
those
two
sentences,
at
the
beginning
of
section
307(b)(1).
but
every
once
in
a
while
one
of
the
old
latin
statutory
construction
phrases
makes
sense
when
applied
in
a
modern
context
to
the
federal
statute
or
construction
problems.
we
think
this
is
a
classic
case,
actually,
for
application
of
the
doctrine
of
statutory
construction
ejusdem
generis
to
construe
the
catch
phrase
at
the
end
of
a
statutory
series
like
those
that
are
similar
to
it
in
the
enumeration
that
proceeds
it.
but
the
key
thing
i
think
the
court
has
to
remember
in
focusing
on
this
case
is
that
the
agency
is
arguing
for
original,
exclusive
and
preclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
section
307(b)(2)
bars
anybody
from
raising
an
issue
in
the
enforcement
proceedings
or
anything
that
would
come
along
subsequently,
if
that
issue
could
have
been
raised
under
a
direct
review
action
under
section
307(b)(1).
now,
i
recognize
that
in
this
particular
case
the
briefing
might
not
be
especially
helpful,
at
least
the
opening
brief
of
epa
is
cryptic.
our
responsive
brief
and
epa's
reply
are
really
where
the
arguments
are
found.
in
addition
to
the
problems
of
just
discussing
the
type
of
action
that
took
place
in
this
case,
whether
it
is
final,
we
believe
that
epa
has
misread
seriously
three
statutory
provisions,
as
well
as
our
position
in
the
case.
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
take
a
few
minutes
at
the
outset
and
summarize
our
arguments
and
position
and
perhaps
support
the
case
in
the
context
and
then
focus
on
the
detailed
points.
i
remind
the
court
that
congress
established
the
special
judicial
review
provisions
in
1970.
it
mandated
at
that
time
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals
for
certain
specifically
enumerated
actions.
other
actions
were
definitely
at
that
time
reviewed
in
district
courts
under
the
generally
applicable
federal
question
jurisdictional
grant
and
then
the
administrative
procedure
act.
those
other
actions
or
the
actions
that
were
brought
in
district
court
included
actions
to
review
the
application
of
the
new
source
standards,
in
fact
the
application
of
the
new
source
standards
at
issue
in
this
particular
case.
there
were
a
series
of
district
court
actions
that
took
place
between
1970
and
1977
on
these
precise
types
of
matters.
in
1977,
however,
congress
added
a
number
of
further
specific
sections
to
the
listing
that
was
in
section
307
and
it
added
those
other
final
action
catch
words
at
the
end
of
the
two
sentences.
now,
epa's
arguments
are
based
on
the
broadest
conceivable
reading
of
those
other
final
action
catch
words.
they
are
so
broad
that
they
would
make
the
specific
listing
that
precedes
it
redundant
and
useless.
the
words
"special
enumeration"
might
as
well
not
be
there
at
all.
you
can
construe
the
other
final
catch
words
in
light
of
the
enumeration,
however,
because
that
specified
list
of
actions,
both
in
the
first
sentence
and
in
the
second
one,
deal
with
a
consistent
class
of
actions.
those
actions,
if
you
look
at
them
and
analyze
them
in
detail,
all
are
either
ruling
actions
or
they
are
adjudications
where
epa
has
to
act
on
the
basis
of
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
the
affected
party.
and
that
opportunity
for
a
hearing
brings
into
play
the
formal
adjudication
provisions
of
section
554
of
the
apa
and
it
insures
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
a
record
available
to
it
for
review.
and
accordingly,
and
make
no
mistake
about
it,
our
position
on
jurisdiction
is
in
no
way
unclear.
in
short,
and
i
would
like
to
reiterate
it
again,
we
say
that
a
ejusdem
generis
construction
of
the
other
final
action
catchwords
would
include
either
epa
action
which
is
rule-making
or
adjudication
where
the
statute
on
its
face
provides
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
bringing
into
play
section
554
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
we
recognize
--
the
rule-making,
by
the
way,
would
either
have
to
be
subject
to
section
553
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
to
the
further
provisions
that
actually
in
the
clean
air
act
in
section
307(d)
that
displace
the
administrative
procedure
act's
provisions
and
are
more
stringent
in
certain
respects,
especially
insofar
as
keeping
a
docket
and
making
a
record.
now,
we
recognize
that
ejusdem
generis
construction
construction
of
the
other
final
action
catch
words
would
not
include
the
section
112
reference
in
listing
in
the
second
sentence
because
section
112,
while
it
refers
to
hazardous
substances,
does
not
call
for
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
the
part
of
the
private
party.
section
112
however
deals
with
three
different
kinds
of
actions.
it
deals
with
an
approval
by
epa,
actually
epa,
not
a
state,
of
an
application
or
a
notice
for
permission
to
either
build
or
modify
a
plant
that
emits
hazardous
pollutants.
in
the
second
part
it
deals
with
violations
of
hazardous
pollutants.
and
in
the
third
part
it
deals
with
waivers
from
that
hazardous
pollutant
standard.
section
112(c)
does
require
in
each
of
these
three
instances
that
epa
make
statutorily
defined
findings
before
it
takes
its
action.
accordingly,
we
believe
that
section
112(c)'s
provisions
can
be
taken
into
account
in
a
ejusdem
generis
construction
of
these
other
final
action
catch
words
if
the
court
wants
to,
because
it
could
add
to
the
categories
of
adjudication
which
are
covered
by
those
catch
words
those
actions
which
are
taken
by
epa
where
the
statute
expressly
requires
that
certain
determinations
or
factual
findings
to
be
made
in
support
of
its
action.
we
don't
think,
and
the
reason
we
don't
put
that
forward
as
a
favored
construction
of
the
statute
is
that
section
112(c)
is
an
exceptional
provision
in
the
statute.
this
court
has
had
the
adamo
wrecking
case
before
it,
it
knows
that
the
act
has
special
provisions
for
enforcement
as
well
as
judicial
review
for
hazardous
pollutants
and
we
think
that
section
112(c)
is
an
exception
and
you
don't
need
to
include
it
within
this
ejusdem
generis
class.
but
either
way,
whether
the
court
would
adopt
the
optional
construction
or
not,
you
wouldn't
have
reached
the
action
in
the
present
case
because
here
you
don't
have
the
requirement
at
all
stated
in
the
statute
that
epa
make
these
types
of
final
determinations.
we
do
agree
with
epa
that
it
is
a
final
determination.
ppg
was
in
the
process
of
building
that
plant.
it
was
just
about
built
at
the
time
this
all
started
and,
indeed,
it
had
to
know
whether
or
not
those
standards
in
the
fossil
fuel-fired
generating
unit
requirements
that
epa
had
put
forward
were
applicable
or
not.
it
had
to
govern
its
conduct
by
them
as
it
operated
this
particular
plant.
we
do
think
in
construing
the
statute
that
the
court
should
be
particularly
concerned
about
epa's
most
expansive
reading,
because
it
would
really
have
a
strong
adverse
affect
on
judicial
administration.
you
heavily
burden
the
courts
of
appeals
with
review
of
actions
by
epa
that
were
taken
outside
the
administrative
record.
as
professor
currie
points
out,
anytime
you
have
an
adjudication
that
does
not
take
place
under
section
554
the
agency
can
go
outside
the
administrative
record
and
grasp
grounds
for
its
decision.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no,
it
wouldn't
necessarily,
justice
rehnquist,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
you
are
going
to
have
many
more
petitions
for
review
filed
in
the
courts
of
appeal
under
this
reading
than
you
are
any
other
reading
of
the
statute.
and
that
is
because
of
the
review
preclusion
provisions.
you
are
going
to
have
people
who
realize
that
they
only
have
one
chance
to
get
review.
unless
they
carry
forward
any
possible
claim
they
might
have
within
the
60-day
time
period,
they
lose,
under
the
yakus
case,
the
right
to
review
those
issues
entirely.
you
have
got
to
remember
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
because
if
you
were
in
the
district
court
you
would
be
outside
the
reach
of
section
307(b)(1)
and
section
307(b)(1)
in
the
judicial
review
provisions
and
section
307(b)(2)
in
the
review
preclusion
provisions
have
a
juxtaposed
scope.
the
preclusion
provisions
get
carried
along
or
drug
along
by
the
coverage
of
the
judicial
provisions.
so
if
you
were
in
district
court
you
wouldn't
be
under
the
special
review
provisions
at
all.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
and
the
second
reason,
though,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
overton
park
case,
a
district
court
can
use
discovery
means,
it
has
those
procedures
available
to
prove
out
the
non-record
aspect
of
the
agency
action.
it
can
use
them.
it
doesn't
have
to
use
discovery
in
aid
of
a
trial
of
de
novo
facts
but
it
uses
the
discovery
to
prove
out
the
basis
for
the
agency's
action.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
your
honor,
it
could
but
as
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
the
overton
park
case
where
the
court
points
out,
i
think
it
is
at
page
420,
anytime
you
remand
to
the
agency,
when
you
have
got
a
circumstance
like
that,
you
are
going
to
risk
post
hoc
rationalization
and
the
opinion
in
the
overton
park
case
warns
that
you
don't
give
deference,
or
the
court
doesn't
give
deference
to
what
results
from
the
remand,
because
of
that
danger.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
was
acutely
aware
of
that.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes,
it
did;
it
definitely
did
that,
yes.
you
warned
that
that
might
be
a
consequence
of
it.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes.
but
in
any
event
what
we
are
saying
is
the
fifth
circuit
was
acutely
aware
of
this
because
it
had
had
a
case
called
save
the
bay
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
your
honor,
we
tried
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
we
would
have
liked
to
have
had
some
readings
for
the
application
of
the
new
source
standards
in
this
particular
case
that
focus
on
the
particular
requirements
that
were
placed
on
the
waste
heat
boilers,
because
as
the
court
knows
from
looking
at
the
briefs
and
the
record,
these
are
not
your
standard
every-day
boilers.
they
fit
in
the
midst
of
a
cogeneration
system
where
the
actual
air
feed
to
the
boilers
come
is
the
turbine
exhaust
gas.
you
cannot
measure,
as
a
consequence,
the
pollutants
in
the
exhaust,
if
you
will,
from
the
waste
heat
boilers
and
get
the
numbers
where
the
pollutant
parameters
are
actually
specified
in
epa's
new
source
standards,
because
you
have
a
combination
of
the
pollutants
from
the
supplemental
fuel
there
along
with
those
from
the
turbines,
which
are
completely
separate
and
apart.
and
epa
as
a
consequence
couldn't
directly
apply
the
new
source
standards
in
this
case.
one
of
our
problems
has
always
been
that
it
applied
special
ad
hoc
requirements
that
we
say
are
not
specified
in
the
statute
and,
indeed,
at
that
time
were
not
authorized.
but
we
never
have
really
gotten
to
that
claim.
we
are
focused
on
the
particular
difference
between
a
waste
heat
boiler
in
a
cogeneration
system
and
a
regular
boiler,
because
we
have
been
arguing
about,
among
other
things,
jurisdiction
and
review.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
at
the
time
we
filed,
and
this
goes
back
to
the
timing
of
the
particular
letters
where
you
have
to
realize
that
we
had
a
letter
on
august
3
that
basically
said
the
requirements
applied
only
at
the
time
we
were
operating
--
or
ppg
was
operating
those
boilers
with
100-percent
fossil
fuel,
no
input
from
the
--
or
no
waste
heat
from
the
turbines
at
all.
and
then
the
clean
air
act
was
actually
passed
or
enacted
by
the
president's
signature
on
august
7.
then
we
get
the
letter
of
august
18
that
says
we
were
wrong
on
august
3,
what
we
are
really
going
to
do
is
apply
the
new
source
standards
and
we
are
going
to
apply
the
specific
ad
hoc
requirements
without
necessarily
any
statement
or
reasons
by
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
informal
actions
that
epa
takes
that
do
have
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
in
this
particular
case
the
agency
could
have
had
an
adequate
record
for
review.
in
fact,
following
along
with
a
question
that
justice
stevens
asked
earlier,
after
we
got
the
august
18
letter
we
went
back
to
the
agency
and
had
a
meeting
at
which
we
tried
to
discuss
the
particular
ad
hoc
requirements
that
were
imposed
that
weren't
set
out
in
the
standard.
and
we
did
not
get
any
resolution
of
that;
there
were
no
letters
written,
there
was
no
correspondence
at
all
that
is
reflected
in
the
administrative
record
in
this
particular
case.
if
we
would
have
gotten
a
series
of,
again,
amendments
if
you
will,
to
the
final
order
to
take
those
further
matters
into
account,
then
i
think
we
would
have
come
closer
to
having
an
adequate
record
for
review.
but
that
was
in
part
why
especially
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"we
don't
know
why
they
chose
these
particular
requirements,
it
is
a
skeletal
record
insofar
as
that
is
concerned."
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no,
your
honor.
justice
white,
that
is
why
we
put
forward
very
carefully
a
bright
line
ejusdem
generis
construction
of
those
catch
words
at
the
end
of
the
statute.
this
problem
didn't
arise
prior
to
the
1977
amendments,
because
you
had
court
of
appeals
exclusive
and
preclusive
jurisdiction
limited
to
specific
enumerated
actions.
and
as
i
said,
those
actions
were
the
rule-making
or
they
were
adjudication
where
the
agency
on
the
statute
had
a
responsibility
to
provide
the
affected
party
with
an
opportunity
for
hearing
unless
you
brought
section
554
of
the
apa
into
play.
and
it
is
only
when
you
get
these
unclear
and
ambiguous
words
on
a
final
action
that
you
have
a
problem.
and
we
think
those
words
are
ambiguous
only
standing
alone,
because
if
you
take
the
context
of
the
sections,
section
307(b)(1),
and
what
happened
in
1970
in
particular,
when
congress
put
that
in
place,
because
congress
at
that
time
put
it
in
place
with
a
careful
recognition
that
it
was
applying
the
special
review
listing
only
to
actions
which
would
have
an
adequate
record
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
with
the
action
that
it
actually
took
in
1977,
you
do
not
get
the
very
broadest
possible
reading
that
epa
has
put
forward.
instead
you
get
ejusdem
generis
construction.
that
is
the
other
final
action
really
means
things
that
are
like
the
things
that
are
in
the
listing,
not
anything.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
precisely.
that
is
precisely
--
we
agree
with
the
agency
completely.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
we
--
justice
white,
we
agree
with
the
agency
completely,
the
union
of
bright
line
jurisdiction
rule,
you
mean
something
that
you
can
tell
on
the
face
of
the
statute
before
you
even
go
into
one
of
these
proceedings
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
be
subject
to
at
the
end,
exclusive
and
preclusive
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals
or
whether
you
are
not,
and
you
can
raise
defenses
in
enforcement
cases
or
go
to
the
district
court
for
review
if
you
want
to.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
but
justice
white,
the
application
of
epa's
rule
would
mean
that
you
would
have
everything
from,
oh,
i
think
of
epa's
decision
to
black
list
a
company
from
federal
contracts,
it
is
informal
adjudication;
it
doesn't
have
a
record
attached
to
it.
you
could
have
--
i
suppose
if
epa
ever
gets
to
the
point
where
it
puts
up
auto
inspection
stations
in
those
states
that
won't
do
it
themselves
for
emission
requirements,
individual
cars
going
through
that
auto
inspection
station,
that
would
be
a
final
action
by
the
agency,
certainly
insofar
as
that
particular
car
is
concerned.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes,
that
is
precisely
right.
and
we
think
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that
is
precisely
it.
and
that
is
the
criteria
that
the
congress
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no,
not
at
all;
that
is
precisely
right.
you
can
take
the
statute,
you
can
construe
it
i
suppose
without
regard
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
because
jurisdictionally
we
think
on
any
proper
ejusdem
generis
construction
of
the
statute
we
would
fall
outside
the
special
court
of
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
it
would
include
rule-making,
because
the
actions
both
in
the
first
and
second
sentences
do
include
some
rule-making.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that
is
right,
because
they
are
either
subject
to
553
of
the
apa
or
the
special
provisions
of
section
307(d).
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
and
it
would
include
also
those
adjudications
which
epa
has
to
take
which
are
subject
to
statutorily
the
right
of
an
affected
party
to
request
a
hearing,
to
provide
the
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
and
there
you
actually
bring
into
play
section
554.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that
is
right.
there
is
one
exception,
and
that
is
112(c)
which
deals
with
hazardous
pollutants,
and
that
is
the
only
exception.
epa
has
raised
a
couple
of
other
sections
which
they
say
are
also
exceptions.
they
have
raised
in
particular
sections
111(j)
and
119
as
not
fitting
the
statutory
scheme
or
plan
that
we
have
put
forward.
we
think
it
mistakes
those
provisions.
section
111(j)
authorizes
innovative
technology
waivers
from
new
source
standards.
epa
says
it
requires
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
only
where
the
agency
grants
relief
but
there
is
no
opportunity
for
a
hearing
where
it
denies
it
and
so
it
doesn't
fit.
but
the
statutory
language
actually
says
the
administrator
may
grant
a
waiver
after
notice
and
opportunity
for
public
hearing.
and
given
this
context,
we
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
how
epa
could
possibly
decide
in
advance
of
proceedings
whether
or
not
it
would
ultimately
grant
or
deny
relief.
it
has
to
gather
the
facts,
including
by
a
hearing,
and
then
decide
as
the
statute
says
"after
notice
and
hearing."
the
same
problem
exactly
arises
with
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no,
that
is
precisely
right.
but
that
isn't
the
criteria
even
for
bringing
section
554
in
play,
it
is
just
providing
an
opportunity
for
a
public
hearing.
and,
indeed,
554
as
the
court
well
knows
provides
summary
judgment
opportunities
in
the
administrative
context
and
other
things,
too.
but
it
is
the
fact
that
the
statute
provides
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
that
distinguishes
it.
section
119
is
precisely
the
same.
it
provides
after
notice
and
a
hearing
on
the
record,
in
several
instances.
in
other
words,
you
get
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
under
section
119
as
well.
and
we
think
the
agency's
putting
forward
this
grant
denied
dichotomy
is
a
mis-reading
of
the
statute.
and
that
those
two
sections
do
fit
within
this
general
plan.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
courts
of
appeals
have
actually
made
such
construction.
they
have
used
this
ejusdem
generis
idea.
but
from
the
reverse
vantage
point,
they
have
construed
the
substantive
provisions
that
are
actually
listed
in
the
special
judicial
review
provision
in
light
of
the
record
desired
for
court
of
appeals
review.
an
example
--
and
it
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
--
is
the
marathon
oil
case
at
564
f.2nd
1253.
in
that
case
the
court
had
before
it
the
question
of
whether
the
hearing
required
for
a
clean
water
act
discharge
permit
was
a
formal
adjudicatory
hearing
under
section
554
or
whether
epa
could
dispense
with
the
hearing
requirement
cross-examination
or
particular
requirements
during
the
hearing.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
not
this
precise
issue.
they
have
addressed
certainly
the
scope
of
the
judicial
review
provisions
but
you
have
the
references,
for
example,
of
the
utah
power
case
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that
is
right.
and
the
chrysler
case
under
the
noise
act
and
the
crown
simpson
case
under
the
water
act.
they
have
been
consistent
in
adopting
strict
and
precise
and
carefully
crafted
narrow
interpretations
because
particularly
of
the
review
preclusion
aspects
that
get
carried
along
with
them.
and
also
the
difficulty
of
record
problems
posed
by
review
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no,
but
as
i
am
about
to
point
out
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that
is
precisely
right.
and
in
fact
the
marathon
oil
case
is
one
of
them,
because
in
that
case
the
court
construed
the
reference,
the
substantive
provisions
reference
listing
in
the
special
judicial
review
provisions
to
have
some
impact
on
what
those
actual
requirements
were
for
that
particular
substantive
statute.
and
the
court
said,
actually
quoted
from
the
attorney
general's
manual
on
the
apa
on
the
subject.
the
attorney
general's
manual
had
said
that
a
requirement
that
administrative
decisions
beyond
the
record
can
be
clearly
implied
in
the
provision
for
judicial
review
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal.
that
was
where
the
actual
statute
called
for
a
hearing
but
didn't
say
whether
you
had
on
the
record
such
that
you
would
also
bring
554
into
play.
and
decisions
that
are
consistent
with
marathon
oil
are
the
u.s.
steel
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
seacost
anti-pollution
league
case,
those
are
at
556
f.
2d
and
572
f.
2d
respectively.
so
the
courts
have
used
this
ejusdem
generis
idea
but
they
have
used
it
from
a
reverse
vantage
point.
there
is
one
final
thing
i
would
particularly
like
to
cover
and
that
is
epa's
broad
construction
would
actually
introduce
an
internal
conflict
into
section
307
itself.
as
the
court
knows,
in
the
first
section
of
section
307
the
courts
of
appeals
are
reviewing,
among
other
things,
and
it
says
that
epa's
action
in
promulgating
any
standard
under
section
202
of
the
act,
but
then
right
away
a
parenthetical
clause
appears,
other
than
a
standard
required
to
be
prescribed
under
section
202(b)(1)
of
the
act,
this
section
deals
with
auto
emission
standards.
epa's
broad
reading
of
the
catch
phrase
in
the
sentence
would
actually
draw
back
into
the
ambit
of
court
of
appeals
review
that
item
which
is
specifically
excluded
by
the
parenthetical
exemption.
epa
argues
in
its
reply
brief
that
section
202(b)(1)
of
the
parenthetically
exempted
part
of
the
statute
doesn't
call
on
the
agency
to
take
any
action
which
is
reviewable
in
any
court.
that
is
wrong,
and
that
is
wrong
for
the
reasons
that
are
stated
in
professor
currie's
report
to
the
administrative
conference
which
actually
produced
the
recommendations
that
went
to
congress
and
formed
the
basis
for
the
1977
amendments.
as
professor
currie
pointed
out,
section
202
does
require
or
does
have
in
it
particular
provisions
which
call
for
numbers
in
the
auto
pollution
standards.
those
numbers,
for
example,
are
things
like
1.5
grams
for
a
vehicle
mile
hydrocarbons.
but
in
every
case
the
statute
says
that
epa
standards
may
not
exceed
that
level.
in
other
words,
epa
standards
can
be
more
stringent.
and
as
professor
currie
points
out
in
his
report,
which
is
in
the
iowa
law
review
reprinted
there,
you
have
to
have
court
of
review
or
you
have
to
have
the
opportunity
for
court
review
whether
or
not
epa
properly
exercised
its
power
to
make
the
standards
more
stringent
than
the
statutorily
set
levels
or
not.
and
he
had
concluded
at
that
point
that
the
only
possibility
of
review
of
course
was
in
district
court
under
the
federal
questions
statutes
and
the
administrative
procedure
act,
so
a
review
had
to
be
available
there.
and
we
agree
whole-heartedly.
we
also
note
that
section
202(b)(1)
has
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
when
epa
sets
the
standard
it
doesn't
necessarily
set
it
at
the
precise
numerical
level.
it
can
go
more
--
at
a
level
more
stringent
than
that,
depending
on
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
you
could
have
an
environmental
group
coming
in
and
saying
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
the
possibility
that
just
because
the
statute
does
not
fix
the
standard,
it
allows
discretion.
admittedly,
it
only
allows
it
one
way.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that
is
exactly
right.
and,
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
set
a
more
stringent
standard
and
the
auto
companies
challenge
it,
again
that
review
has
to
be
in
district
court.
and,
moreover,
epa
completely
ignores
the
fact
that
the
1977
amendments
changed
--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
because
the
action
obviously
would
have
national
impact.
i
don't
think
there
is
much
claim
that
the
action
itself
would
not
have
a
nation-wide
scope.
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
focused
as
this
was
on
a
particular
plant
in
one
city
in
lake
charles,
louisiana.
but
the
thing
that
is
missed
is
that
the
statute
was
amended
in
'77
to
add
--
to
require
--
it
actually
requires
epa
to
proscribe
substitute
emission
standards
for
certain
small
manufacturers
of
light-duty
vehicles
and
also
to
deal
with
evaporative
emissions
of
hydrocarbons.
you
can
deal
with
these
two
things
also
by
calling
for
district
court
review,
by
of
course
having
the
ejusdem
generis
construction
of
the
catch
phrase
reflect
the
particular
exemption
that
is
in
the
particular
item
in
the
series.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
