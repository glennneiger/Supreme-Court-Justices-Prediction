ms.
maryann
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
is
quite
familiar
with
the
complexities
of
the
clean
air
act.
in
1977
congress
substantially
amended
the
act,
including
the
judicial
review
provisions
of
section
307(b)(1).
that
section
now
gives
original
jurisdiction--to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
review
the
administrative
actions
under
certain
enumerated
sections
of
the
act
and
other
final
actions
which
have
nationwide
application
or
effect.
the
regional
courts
of
appeal
are
given
original
jurisdiction
over
other
enumerated
sections
of
the
act
and
"any
other
final
action
of
the
administrator
under
the
act"
of
local
or
state-wide
effect
or
application.
we
contend,
epa
does,
that
section
307(b)(1)
means
exactly
what
it
says,
that
the
courts
of
appeal
have
original
jurisdiction
to
review
all
action,
all
final
actions
by
the
administrator
taken
under
the
act
and
to
explain
this
interpretation
first
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes,
your
honor;
right.
except
for
the
provision
under
the
citizens'
supervision
under
section
304,
right;
yes.
ms.
maryann
walsh
to
some
extent
admittedly
the
legislative
history
on
section
307(b)(1)
in
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
it
is
not
extremely
helpful
but
it
is
not
unhelpful
either,
your
honor.
it
is
obvious
that
congress
was
most
concerned
with
and
addressed
the
problem
of
allocating
venue
between
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
regional
courts
of
appeals.
congress
did
indicate
however
that
they
were
placing
review
of
all
rules
and
orders
of
regional,
statewide
or
local
application
with
the
regional
courts
of
appeals.
and
this
was
an
expansion
of
the
jurisdiction
under
the
1977
amendments.
another
significant
fact
is
that
the
house
bill
that
the
house
report
that
this
legislative
history
is
in
was
addressing,
at
that
point
the
only
amendment
to
what
had
been
the
prior
section
307(b)(1)
was
the
"any
other
final
action"
language.
so
the
legislative
history
was
addressing
that
addition
to
section
307(b)(1).
so
limited
as
the
legislative
history
is,
it
does
indicate
that
congress
was
aware
of
an
expansion
of
jurisdiction.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
particular
final
action
involved
in
this
case
and
then
explain
why
our
interpretation
is
the
most
manageable,
practical
and
efficient
way
of
interpreting
section
307(b)(1).
in
august
1971,
the
administrator
promulgated
proposed
new
source
performance
standards
for
stationary
sources,
which
included
emission
limitations
for
sulfur
dioxides.
the
statute
at
that
time
--
and
it
still
does,
as
amended
defines
new
stationary
sources
to
include
sources
which
were
modified
or
constructed
after
the
date
of
the
proposed
regulations.
and
stationary
sources
were
also
defined
to
include
fossil
fuel-fired
steam
generating
plants
such
as
ppg
has
at
its
lake
charles,
louisiana
facility.
now,
in
may
1975
epa
wrote
ppg
and
asked
that
ppg
provide
additional
--
not
additional,
but
provide
information
as
to
the
operation
of
its
facility
and
what
was
included
on
the
possibility
that
the
new
source
performance
standards
might
be
applicable
to
the
louisiana
facility.
in
may
and
in
june
of
that
year
ppg
responded
with
their
interpretation
of
whether
the
new
source
performance
standards
would
apply
or
not.
they
provided
detailed
diagrams
of
their
facility,
purchase
order
as
to
when
the
different
parts
of
the
facility,
because
only
one
section
of
the
overall
facility,
chemical
manufacturing
facility
was
particularly
involved,
purchase
orders
for
those
parts
of
it.
in
october
of
1976
epa
concluded
that
the
new
source
performance
standards
would
be
applicable
to
the
facility
because
of
the
construction
date,
the
date
construction
had
commenced
after
the
date
of
the
proposed
regulations.
ppg
requested
a
reconsideration
of
that
and
submitted
additional
material.
a
meeting
was
later
held
between
ppg
officials
and
epa
representatives
and
epa
concluded
that
its
original
determination
was
still
in
fact
in
effect.
in
april
of
1977
ppg,
as
permitted
under
epa's
regulations,
formally
asked
for
a
"determination
of
construction"
and
along
with
that
"determination"
request,
which
was
essentially
a
request
for
epa
to
reconsider
its
prior
conclusion,
ppg
submitted
a
memorandum
of
law
and
a
memorandum
of
facts,
once
again
setting
out
its
interpretation.
there
is
no
indication
here
that
ppg
was
ever
prevented
from
adding
all
of
the
material
it
wanted
to
to
the
record.
nevertheless,
epa
determined
in
june
of
'77
that
its
original
conclusion
still
held,
that
despite
further
review
of
the
facility
and
the
standards,
that
the
standards
were
applicable
to
pgg's
facility.
ppg
subsequently
filed
a
petition
for
review
with
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
at
ppg's
request
dismissed
the
petition
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
under
section
307(b)(1).
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
place
review
of
final
actions
in
the
courts
of
appeals
where
the
action
by
the
administrator
was
based
on
what
it
termed
was
a
skeletal
record,
as
in
this
case.
the
fifth
circuit
was
also
apparently
quite
influenced
by
the
lack
of
discovery
apparatus,
the
mechanical
limitations
that
were
inherent
in
courts
of
appeals
v.
district
courts.
and
on
that
basis,
the
fifth
circuit
read
final
action
very
narrowly.
they
did
not
provide
a
criteria
for
interpreting
that
phrase,
however.
ms.
maryann
walsh
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
it
was
sufficient
for
epa
to
make
the
determination
that
was
involved.
granted
in
comparison
to
administrative
records
in
other
cases
where
the
issue
involved,
the
legal
issue
and
the
factual
matters
are
much
more
extensive,
it
was
small
as
compared
to
numerous
boxes
of
material.
but
it
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
well,
that
analysis
of
the
record
goes
both
ways.
was
it
substantively
on
the
merits;
was
it
sufficient
to
uphold
epa's
decision.
but
the
primary
question
i
suppose
is.
was
it
--
if
record
sizes
are
criteria
or
jurisdiction
or
determination
of
jurisdiction,
then
that
would
be
the
appropriate
question.
we
contend,
however,
that
is
not
the
criteria
for
determining
jurisdiction
and
on
that
basis
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
analyze
the
size
or
the
quantity
of
the
record.
ms.
maryann
walsh
not
necessarily,
in
that
if
there
is
a
record,
and
the
administrator's
decision
must
be
based
on
a
record
to
be
sustainable,
certainly.
now,
congress
has
provided
that
on
petitions
for
review
there
will
be
a
sufficient
record
presented
to
the
courts
of
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.
2113.
that
specifies
what
the
agency
must
certify
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
petition
for
review
and
that,
then,
constitutes
the
reviewable
record.
and
that
assures,
contrary
to
what
the
fifth
circuit
assumed
in
this
instance,
that
a
reviewable
record
will
always
be
presented
to
the
--
an
appellate
court.
now,
if
that
standard
can't
be
met,
if
there
is
no
record
to
certify,
then
on
that
basis
there
would
not
be
a
jurisdiction
over
that
particular
action.
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes.
ms.
maryann
walsh
well,
i
believe
that
i
would
assume
that
option
would
be
available
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
way
to
interpret
the
statute
is
that
what
is
necessary
to
supplement
the
record
to
determine
whether
the
administrator's
action
was
sustainable
or
not
would
be
remand
to
the
agency
for
supplementation
or
the
other
options
that
would
be
available
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
might
in
some
instances
be
the
appointment
of
a
special
master.
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes.
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maryann
walsh
but
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
speeding
up
--
certainly
speeding
up
the
application
and
determining
the
finality
of
the
administrator's
actions.
and
we
are
not
saying
that
this
is
a
way
for
it
to
--
that
epa
gets
by
by
making
decisions
on
inadequate
records,
certainly
not.
but
without
having
to
--
without
tying
jurisdiction
--
without
tying
jurisdiction
to
record
size,
that
hurdle,
that
initial
hurdle
of
the
analysis
of
the
record
as
the
determiner
of
jurisdiction
is
removed.
now,
certainly
that
doesn't
remove
the
necessity
to
analyze
the
record
on
its
substance
under
the
judicial
review
of
the
administrator's
actions
as
supported
by
that
record.
ms.
maryann
walsh
well,
on
the
basis
that
it
--
certainly
there
is
that
indication
in
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion.
however,
on
the
basis
of
what
it
termed
a
skeletal
record
it
refused
to
take
jurisdiction,
determining
that
the
skeletal
quality
of
the
record
is
what
prevented
it
under
section
307(b)(1)
from
taking
jurisdiction
which
then,
under
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
and
reading
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
and
reading
what
the
fifth
circuit
did,
means
that
analyzing
the
record
and
the
skeletal
or
non-skeletal
quality
of
it
is
the
basis
on
which
jurisdiction
must
originally
be
determined
under
section
307(b)(1).
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
characterization
of
the
record
has
to
be
recognized
as
first
going
to
jurisdiction
as
well
as
to
the
substance
of
the
record.
the
reason
that
we
feel
that
section
307(b)(1)
must
be
determined
to
place
original
and
exclusive
review
over
all
final
actions
in
the
courts
of
appeals
is
that,
as
i
have
indicated,
this
is
a
final
and
definite
way
of
determining
jurisdiction
from
the
outset.
and
this
serves
the
purpose
not
merely
of
epa,
and
probably
epa
is
the
last
party
it
serves,
but
most
importantly
it
facilitates
actions
moving
through
the
courts
--
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
it
does
not
cause
an
inefficient
waste
of
time
in
either
the
district
court
or
the
courts
of
appeals.
it
works
to
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
i
would
say
that,
yes,
it
would
be
--
it
could
have
been
considered
final
agency
action,
because
that
certainly
is
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes.
the
reason
why
the
june
8
is
characterized
as
final
action,
certainly
for
these
purposes,
is
that
the
october
letter
indicated
that
it
was
the
agency's
final
decision
but
i
believe
it
also
referred
to
the
fact
that
if
ppg
had
any
further
questions
or
requested
a
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes,
i
believe
so.
if
ppg
had
made
no
request
or
submitted
a
petition
for
review
after
receiving
the
october
letter,
that
would
have
constituted
final
agency
action
that
was
reviewable.
now,
epa
and
ppg
kept
open
the
reconsideration
of
the
determination
at
that
point,
with
ppg
supplying
further
information
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
in
the
sense
that
they
could
now
file
another
petition
for
review
on
that
basis,
no,
because
it
would
be
the
same
--
is
the
same
determination
that
is
involved
and
we
are
already
involved
with
a
petition
for
review
on
the
particular
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes,
but
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
particular
agency
action
involved.
now,
under
the
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
no,
not
between
--
not
between
june
and
the
subsequent
june
letter
which
reaffirmed
the
october
decision.
by
referring
to
the
later
determination
we
give
advantage
to
ppg
or
to
whatever
affected
the
party.
now,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
section
307(b)(1)
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
and
that
is
the
publication.
ms.
maryann
walsh
congress
specified
because
of
problems
that
had
previously
been
encountered
in
the
act
as
to
what
the
proper
filing
time
was.
since
there
is
a
cut-off
date
as
to
when
that
filing
can
be
made,
that
the
administrator
was
to
publish
in
the
federal
register
notice
of
the
publications,
actions,
determinations
and
that
the
time
to
file
a
petition
for
review
would
start
60
days
from
that
notice.
now
there
--
and
as
epa
recognizes
in
this
case
there
was
no
federal
register
publication,
epa's
policy
as
they
have
reiterated
now
is
to
publish
all
the
determinations.
the
only
problem
is
that
it
goes
to
how
long
the
affected
party
has
available
to
seek
a
petition
for
review.
in
this
instance
the
situation
--
the
effect
was
that
it
worked
to
the
advantage
of
ppg.
in
other
words,
that
60-day
time
period
never
never
started
running.
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes,
they
could
have,
because
there
was
--
the
opportunity
for
review
remains
open
if
that
federal
notice
has
never
been
published.
now,
an
enforcement
action
is
brought,
we
would
contend
that
the
appropriate
--
the
circumstances,
the
scenario
at
that
point
would
be
to
file
a
--
they
can
still
file
a
petition
for
review
of
the
administrator's
action
under
307(b)(1).
and
that
probably
the
enforcement
proceeding
should
be
held
in
abeyance
pending
that
determination.
but
that
for
closure
effect
of
307(e)
--
excuse
me,
(b)(2)
does
not
go
into
effect
because
the
opportunity
to
challenge
it
still
remains
open.
that
is
why
epa
is
making
efforts
to
see
that
all
of
its
final
actions
will
be
published
in
the
federal
register.
ms.
maryann
walsh
if
because
they
would
not
have
been
reviewable
under
307(b)(1).
finality
is
a
prerequisite
for
jurisdiction.
certainly
if
it
is
not
final,
then
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
district
court
under
principles
of
administrative
law
would
be
able
to
review
it.
ms.
maryann
walsh
having
once
made
--
in
other
words,
going
back
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
no.
ms.
maryann
walsh
well,
assuming
that
it
is
always
acting
in
accordance
with
the
statute
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
exactly.
ms.
maryann
walsh
and
if
that
would
happen,
then
the
affected
party
would
have
the
opportunity
to
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
no,
the
agency
is
not
precluded
from
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
--
changing
the
regulations.
ms.
maryann
walsh
because
it
--
it
--
that
particular
action
--
and
this
goes
more
to
the
merits
of
the
actions
that
are
involved
--
determined
that
the
new
source
performance
standards
would
be
applicable
to
the
facility
at
that
point.
and
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
that's
right.
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
purported
final
action.
it
is
a
final
determination.
certainly,
as
this
case
represents,
there
has
been
no
determination
of
the
applicability
of
the
new
source
performance
standards,
to
my
knowledge,
for
the
other
emission
category
such
as
the
nitrogen
oxides,
and
a
final
action
by
epa
or
a
decision
that
those
regulations
apply
to
the
ppg
facility.
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes,
your
honor;
right.
in
other
words,
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
that
would
be
subject
to
examination
here
or
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
the
option
of
remanding
to
the
agency
for
completion
of
the
administrative
proceedings
or
further
administrative
hearings,
whatever
is
involved.
the
critical
factor
and
the
issue
we
are
directed
at
today
is
that
the
rightness
or
the
substantiality
of
the
record,
of
supporting
the
administrator's
record
--
decision,
rather,
does
not
go
to
determining
jurisdiction
under
307(b)(1),
the
language
of
307(b)(1)
that
the
indication
and
the
intent
of
congress
is
that
jurisdiction
be
a
definite
concept.
and
the
way
to
make
it
a
definite
concept
consistent
with
reading
the
statute
is
to
make
exactly
what
this
section
says,
to
make
all
final
actions
reviewable
in
the
courts
of
appeal.
ms.
maryann
walsh
no,
they
said
that
it
--
they
said
it
was
not
--
they
had
no
jurisdiction,
because
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
a
reviewable
record
under
307(b)(1)
for
courts
of
appeal
purposes.
and
they
left
--
very
much
left
the
--
the
--
the
parties,
both
parties
in
the
lurch.
and
i
think
that
that
must
be
the
--
what
will
happen
in
every
case
based
on
the
fifth
circuit's
decision,
because
they
say
that
the
record
that
was
involved
lacked
some
magic
quality
that
would
make
it
reviewable.
now,
the
option
that
is
available
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
in
reviewing
administrative
action
under
this
court's
line
of
cases
is
remand
to
the
agency.
so
the
fifth
circuit
concentration
on
the
discovery
apparatus
or
the
mechanical
limitations
inherent
in
the
courts
of
appeals
was
really
irrelevant
because
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
district
court
had
that
option
available
to
them
when
reviewing
the
administrative
record.
therefore
the
most
efficient
way
to
interpret
section
307(b)(1)
and
the
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
integrity
of
the
statute,
the
statutory
language,
is
to
read
it
as
definite
earmark
or
determination
of
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
maryann
walsh
i
would
like
to
try
and
show
some
of
the
shadows
on
ppg's
bright
line
of
ejusdem
generis.
first
of
all,
as
we
discussed
in
our
reply
brief,
there
are
certain
actions
that
the
administrator
can
take
under
the
act
that
are
specified
in
the
enumerated
portions
of
307(b)(1)
that
would
not
necessarily
be
based
on
the
--
a
complete
formal
record,
the
type
that
ppg
requires.
i
think
one
of
the
mistakes
that
ppg
makes
is
they
assume
that
every
time
you
have
an
action
made
on
a
record
that
there
will
be
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
and
a
hearing
that
is
conducted.
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
section
553
providing
for
rule-making
requires
that
rule-making
proceed
on
a
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
hearing.
and
that
opportunity
for
hearing
may
consist
of
just
the
type
of
action
taken
in
this
case.
that
is
the
submission
of
data,
the
transfer
of
correspondence
between
the
agency
and
the
party
involved.
in
other
words,
ppg
assumes,
reads
into
the
statute
things
that
are
not
there,
the
requirement
of
what
they
would
call
a
complete
and
presumably
an
apa
record
in
their
ejusdem
generis
provisions
of
307.
it
is
not
provided
in
the
apa,
they
are
asking
more
than
the
apa
does.
the
types
of
actions
that
congress
refers
to
in
those
enumerated
sections
are
not
necessarily
the
types
of
actions
that
would
be
based
on
a
record
after
a
formal
hearing.
so
that
looking
to
ejusdem
generis,
which
is
no
more
than
an
aid
to
construction,
it
certainly
should
not
be
referred
to
as
a
controlling
interpretive
principle
for
this
important
provision
of
the
act.
looking
to
ejusdem
generis,
it
does
not
provide
us
with
a
clear
definite
way
of
interpreting
the
statute.
of
necessity
it
requires
a
reference
to
at
least
one,
of
not
two
courts
before
there
is
a
final
--
possibly
three
courts,
before
there
is
a
final
determination
of
jurisdiction.
the
question
was
asked
as
to
the
burden
that
would
be
put
on
courts
of
appeals.
under
our
reading
of
the
statute
of
all
references
made
to
courts
of
appeal
on
petitions
for
review,
certainly
ppg's
reference
or
interpretation
does
not
ease
the
load
on
the
courts.
it
allows
for
application
to
a
district
court.
if
the
district
court's
analysis
of
the
record
or
determination
of
jurisdiction
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
first
of
all
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
we
certainly
recognize
that
and
that
is
why
we
are
looking
for
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
would
not
overly
burden
the
courts.
ms.
maryann
walsh
certainly,
that
is
just
what
i
was
going
to
point
out,
that
that
decision
in
and
of
itself
would
be
appealable.
ms.
maryann
walsh
i
can't
give
you
a
definite
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
no,
i
would
not
indicate
that.
ms.
maryann
walsh
certainly
the
possibility
is
there
for
a
large
percentage.
i
would
point
out
that
the
ppg
brief
made
reference
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
no,
they
are
not.
ms.
maryann
walsh
i
am
not
sure
as
to
that
amount
but
they
--
the
possibility
is
there
for
reference
to
one,
if
not
two,
courts.
the
definite
possibility,
the
thing
we
can
say
with
certainty
is
that
when
a
final
action
is
involved
we
have
an
uncertain
determination
of
jurisdiction
under
ppg's
interpretation
of
this
of
the
statute.
ms.
maryann
walsh
that
possibility
is
there
anytime
you
have
administrative
action
the
possibility
of
it
being
non-pliable
and
no
burden
is
there
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
no
--
right
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
but
on
the
basis
of
where
our
records
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
do
you
mean
as
to
the
application
of
the
regulations
or
this
particular
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
it
would
seem
to
me
that
camp
v.
pitts
where
the
record
was
based
on
a
request
for
a
determination
by
the
comptroller
the
determination
was
made
on
the
exchange
of
correspondence
would
be
the
most
similar.
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes.
ms.
maryann
walsh
it
is
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
we
are
concerned
with
jurisdiction,
which
we
believe
is
--
ms.
maryann
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
ask
that
this
circuit
be
reversed.
thank
you.
