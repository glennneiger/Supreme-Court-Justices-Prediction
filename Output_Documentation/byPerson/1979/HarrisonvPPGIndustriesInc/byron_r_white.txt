justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
final
--
i
must
confess
--
i
know
the
parties
don't
argue
this,
but
i
have
some
question
about
the
finality
of
the
june
8
letter
itself.
now,
that
is
the
final
agency
action
that
is
under
review,
the
june
8,
1977
letter.
that
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
agency
refuses
to
change
the
position
it
expressed
in
its
october
5,
1976
letter.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
know
is
whether
you
regard
the
october
5,
1976
letter
as
also
having
been
final
agency
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
as
final
as
the
june
8
letter
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
it
was
still
open
to
ppg
after
the
june
8
letter
to
ask
further
questions,
because
they
had
further
correspondence.
and
on
august
18
they
got
still
another
final
agency
action,
didn't
they?
don't
we
have
three
different
letters,
each
of
which
has
an
equal
claim
to
finality,
that
is
at
the
moment
it
was
received?
justice
byron
r.
white
couldn't
ppg
today
write
another
letter
and
say,
"we
have
got
another
idea,
we
will
only
use
90
percent
oil
and
10
percent
gas,"
or
something
like
this.
would
that
change
the
situation
if
you
wrote
back
and
said,
"no,
we
adhere
to
our
october
5,
1976
position."
would
that
also
be
a
final
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
effect,
to
file
a
petition
for
review;
is
that
the
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
october
5
determination
--
say
there
had
been
a
criminal
proceeding
or
something
like
that
later
on
and
if
there
is
a
failure
to
seek
review
of
a
final
action
which
is
subject
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
remember
the
statute,
you
cannot
attack
the
determination.
if
there
were
no
publication
in
the
federal
register
and
no
review
sought
from
the
october
5,
'76
proceeding
and
sometime
in
october
or
november
you
start
a
criminal
proceeding,
could
they
have
attacked
the
action
in
such
a
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
if
we
held
that
these
actions,
these
letters
back
and
forth
were
not
final
actions
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
then
the
company
would
always
be
free
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
to
challenge
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
statute
or
regulation
that
would
preclude
epa
from
changing
its
position
on
any
of
these
anytime
it
changed
its
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
anyone
of
these
letters,
could
they
30
days
later
have
said,
"oh,
we
have
reexamined
it
and
we
think
we
have
got
a
little
different
approach
now
and
we
are
going
to
take
a
different
position."
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
a
court
proceeding,
for
example,
after
a
certain
number
of
days
goes
by
the
judge
can't
change
his
mind.
but
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
agency
is
free
change
its
mind
whenever
it
wants
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
the
law
and
the
material
before
it
and
all
the
rest,
but
these
are
complicate
matters.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
been
asked
to
reexamine
by
additional
letters
and
additional
data,
when
the
actual
facility
was
built
and
all
this
sort
of
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
agency
could
change
its
rule
at
any
time
--
it
has
no
time
limit
when
it
can
change
its
ruling.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
nevertheless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless
it
is
the
final
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
we
change
our
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
wrong
with
a
little
post
rationalization?
i
thought
we
remanded
sometimes
because
somebody
hadn't
rationalized
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
send
them
back
and
say,
"look,
it
is
fine
if
you
want
to
reach
this
result
if
you
just
give
some
reasons.
you
didn't
give
enough
reasons.
now
give
some."
and
they
have
post-rationalized
and
send
it
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
weren't
you
might
have
gotten
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
have
gotten
to
the
merits
if
you
weren't
fighting
about
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
the
government
perhaps
have
different
views
of
what
the
universe
of
reviewable
matters
would
contain.
i
suppose
you
might
have
a
different
view
if
99.9
percent
of
the
final
judgments
really
would
have
an
adequate
record.
i
take
it
you
think
that
an
awful
lot
of
them
wouldn't
have
an
adequate
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
a
lot
of
them,
but
i
take
it
you
must
think
that
an
awful
lot
of
them
wouldn't
have
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
if
epa
really
does
its
work
they
probably
can
have
an
adequate
record
in
almost
any
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
is
informal
adjudication.
so
we
should
let
the
possibility
of
an
inadequate
record,
just
because
of
ineptness
send
all
these
cases
to
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
likelihood
of
somebody
having
made
a
mistake.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
predicted
only
about
one
out
of
a
thousand
final
actions
might
have
an
insufficient
record
because
somebody
made
a
mistake,
it
certainly
isn't
much
of
an
argument
for
your
construction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
saying
we
have
to
conduct
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
posted
a
notice
and
nobody
showed
up
at
the
time
for
a
hearing,
if
that
guy
doesn't
have
to
sit
there
for
three
hours
and
twiddle
his
thumbs.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
follow.
why
would
it
be
necessary
to
have
review
of
the
question
whether
the
standard
was
sufficiently
stringent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
company
would
seek
review.
if
it
is
not
stringent
enough
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
facts
are
there
that
there
be
such
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
is,
if
there
is
to
be
review
on
behalf
of
an
environmental
group
that
will
have
so
be
in
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
such
review
provided
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
couldn't
that
review
be
regional
rather
than
national,
the
second
half
of
the
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
makes
quite
a
bit
of
difference
if
you
are
dividing
the
possible
work
up
among
them,
a
hundred
districts,
as
compared
with
11
courts
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let
us
suppose
that
there
were
20,000
final
judgments,
final
orders
every
year
of
epa,
let
us
just
assume
that
a
lot
of
the
courts,
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
are
pretty
heavy,
pretty
deep
under
water;
and
more
so
perhaps
than
a
hundred
district
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
aren't.
they
aren't.
what
percentage
of
judgments
are
appealable,
ms.
walsh?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
won't
tell
me
that
all
of
them
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
large
percentage
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
possibly
all
of
them
would
be.
but
they
aren't.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
even
half
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
like
to
know
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
this
case
you
know
of
to
holding
finality
in
an
order
like
this,
the
cases
you
cite
aren't
very
close.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
order
as
being
a
final
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
letter
of
june
8,
1977.
it
is
the
closest
thing
that
you
have
ever
seen
appealed
to
this
court.
