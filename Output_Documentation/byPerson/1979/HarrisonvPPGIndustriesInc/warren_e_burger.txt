ms.
walsh,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
legislative
history
reveal
whether
the
authors
of
that
amendment,
all
others,
had
any
idea
of
the
scope
of
its
impact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
isn't
very
helpful,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view,
if
the
record
is
one
which
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
agency,
is
it
automatically
sufficient
for
appellate
review
in
the
court
of
appeals?
does
it
always
follow
that
then
it
is
sufficient
for
the
reviewing
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
that
in
a
particular
case
the
agency
considers
the
record
adequate
but
the
court
of
appeals
asked
to
review
it
and
concludes
that
it
is
inadequate,
just
assume
that.
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
could
happen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
it
did
here
now.
could
the
court
of
appeals
appoint
a
special
master
or
a
referee
to
take
testimony
to
fulfill
the
function
that
might
have
been
fulfilled
by
a
district
court.
is
there
any
inherent
power
in
a
court
of
appeals
to
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
an
obvious
alternative,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
always.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
is
the
agency
does
not
lose
jurisdiction
after
it
has
taken
a
purported
final
action
and
an
appeal
has
been
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
unlike
a
district
court,
for
example,
would
have
lost
jurisdiction
and
could
not,
except
by
leave
of
the
court
of
appeals,
modify
findings
or
a
decree.
but
you
say
-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
say
the
agency
does
not
lose
jurisdiction
even
after
it
has
pronounced
a
final
action
in
the
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
your
brief
you
concede
that
under
our
former
cases
even
if
the
action
of
the
epa
is
final
action
and
therefore
subject
to
appellate
review,
it
may
not
be
ripe
for
appellate
review.
do
i
read
your
footnote
correctly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
if
they
remand
it,
if
the
court
of
appeals
would
simply
say
this
is
not
ripe
for
judicial
review,
appellate
review,
then
that
would
be
subject
presumably
to
examination
here
to
see
whether
we
agreed
that
it
was
not
ripe.
is
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
in
this
case,
"this
is
not
ripe
for
review,"
epa
could
then
have
proceeded
to
expand
the
record.
but
in
this
case,
you
were
not
in
a
position
to
expand
the
record
because
they
said
there
was
no
need
for
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lettow.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
walsh,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
ms.
walsh.
thank
you,
mr.
lettow.
the
case
is
submitted.
