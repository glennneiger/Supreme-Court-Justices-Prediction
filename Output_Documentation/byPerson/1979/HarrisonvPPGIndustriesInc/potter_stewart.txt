that
is
to
the
exclusion
of
district
courts,
your
position
is.
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
what
you
think
the
phrase
"any
other
final
action"
in
the
present
307(b)(1)
means.
you
say
ejusdem
generis.
it
means
actions
similar
to
those
which
are
specifically
enumerated?
justice
potter
stewart
and
because
those
would
--
could
be
expected
to
have
adequate
records
to
provide
intelligent
review,
informed
review
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals;
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
whether
in
this
case
there
is
an
adequate
record.
justice
potter
stewart
not
whether
in
any
particular
case
there
is
an
adequate
record.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
ejusdem
would
then
include
what?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
include
all
rule-making.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
would
be
a
hearing
record.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lettow,
with
respect
to
this
precise
issue
now
before
us,
this
may
all
be
in
your
brief
and
i
have
read
them
some
time
ago
and
it
is
not
in
my
mind,
have
the
courts
of
appeals
--
have
any
other
courts
of
appeals
besides
this
one
addressed
this
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
is
in
the
district
of
columbia
court.
justice
potter
stewart
on
this
precise
issue
there
is
no
other
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say
on
the
general
generic
question
there
are
other
courts
of
appeals
decisions
which
are
not
in
conflict
but
rather
are
consistent.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
has
been
litigated
--
justice
potter
stewart
since
everybody
agrees
with
it,
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
since
it
is
jurisdiction,
of
course
we
have
an
independent
duty
to
satisfy
ourselves.
