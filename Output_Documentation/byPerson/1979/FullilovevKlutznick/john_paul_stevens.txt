here
we
have
only
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
the
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
brother
stevens,
you
said
that
this
legislation
would
be
valid
if
there
were
certain
findings.
and
my
question
just
indicated
rather
some
amazement
at
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
benisch,
supposing
that
you
have
a
change
of
administration
and
the
republicans
came
into
power
and
they
they
had
hearings
and
they
decided
in
the
prior
administration
there
had
been
a
disproportionate
amount
of
public
monies
spent
by
--
for
democratic
contractors
who
contributed
to
the
democratic
party.
so
you
said
that
the
remedy
to
that
situation
all
of
the
next
appropriated
funds
shall
go
to
republican
contractors.
would
that
be
constitutional
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
findings,
if
this
was
discrimination
in
the
past?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
even
need
findings
in
my
case.
you
just
pass
a
statute
and
say,
let's
give
all
this
money
to
republicans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
raise
a
constitutional
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
is,
then
if
they
did
that
for
four
years
and
they
said
we
had
better
remedy
what
we
did
in
the
past,
we
will
now
give
it
to
the
democrats.
that
would
not
be
legal.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
it
raises
no
constitutional
question,
there
is
no
constitutional
question.
you
don't
need
any
findings
or
anything.
if
it
does
raise
a
constitutional
question,
why
can't
you
remedy
the
past
constitutional
error
by
correcting
it
in
the
future?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why,
if
you
are
just
equalizing
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
conceded
in
this
case
that
you
are
not
as
bad
a
deal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
an
indian
from
india
would
have
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
there
only
been
one
round
of
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
has
congress
done
it
more
than
once?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
the
set
aside
--
how
often
has
it
enacted
a
set
aside?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
the
governmental
grant-in-aid
to
local
and
state
and
municipal
governments,
so
they
claim
i
suppose,
if
there
is
one,
is
that
those
governmental
entities
have
discriminated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
point
is,
it
is
not
even
going
to
allow
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean,
"the
5th
through
the
14th"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
federal
governmental
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
federal
governmental
action
is
subject
only
to
the
5th
amendment;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
one
distinctive
feature
of
his
opinion
was
that
no
one
single
one
of
these
colleagues
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
this
case
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
which
side
of
the
questions
you
are
on,
but
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
questions
are
not
frivolous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
precisely
the
same
case,
that
a
separate
statute
that
said
$200
million
shall
be
appropriated
and
be
spent
entirely
for
minority
business
enterprises.
and
the
reason
we
are
doing
it
is
we
want
to
remedy
past
discrimination
and
we
want
to
have
more
minority
participation
in
the
economy
in
the
future.
they
said
it
in
words.
why
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
fact
that
it
is
10
percent
is
really
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
electoral
franchise,
which
really
isn't
involved
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
electoral
franchise
is
really
not
involved
here,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
put
to
one
side
just
for
the
moment
the
justification
as
remedy
for
past
discrimination,
do
you
think
the
set-aside
could
be
justified
on
the
theory
that
congress
might
have
thought
it
good
for
the
economy
and
the
community
as
a
whole
to
have
greater
minority
participation
in
the
construction
industry,
entirely
apart
from
past
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
haven't
made
that
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
justify
the
statute
even
though
your
opponent
describes
it
as
a
"piece
of
the
action"
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
much
about
discrimination
against
--
we
have
talked
about
other
groups
aleuts,
for
example,
and
you
know
there
are
some
that
there
may
not
have
been
a
history,
there
may
just
have
been
a
failure
to
participate.
and
i
am
asking
you
whether
you
think
the
congress
could
address
the
problem
of
the
failure
to
participate
even
if
there
is
nothing
invidious
about
the
history.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
one
of
the
problems
about
resting
entirely
on
past
discrimination
is
that
the
beneficiaries
of
the
legislation
may
well
be
people
quite
different
from
those
who
have
suffered
the
most
through
history.
