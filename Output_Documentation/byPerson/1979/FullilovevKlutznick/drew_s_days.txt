mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
have
conceded
that
if
the
nve
provision
at
issue
here
was
enacted
by
congress
to
remedy
past
discrimination
and
if
it
was
properly
tailored
to
achieve
that
objective,
then
this
court
has
to
determine
as
did
the
two
courts
below
that
this
statute
is
not
in
contravention
of
the
constitution
or
federal
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
i
simply
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
matters
are
at
issue
between
us.
i
think
that
as
a
threshold
observation,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
some
of
its
questioning,
we
are
talking
not
about
a
state
legislature,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
city
council,
we
are
talking
about
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
that
as
this
court
has
recognized
has
special
has
special
competence
to
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
effects
of
identified
past
discrimination
and
to
take
appropriate
remedial
measures.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
there
are
several
provisions
of
the
constitution,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
congress
can
rely.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
the
bakke
decision
i
think
goes
into
some
discussion
of
the
role
of
the
congress
with
respect
to
addressing
discrimination.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
justice
powell's
opinion,
i
think
goes
into
that
in
most
detail
but
of
course
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
nevertheless,
i
think
that
some
of
the
things
he
said
in
his
opinion
deserve
to
be
considered
by
litigants
before
this
court
and
by
the
justices
of
the
court.
i
think
there
can
be
no
contravention
that
congress
does
have
this
unique
authority.
we
have
seen
it
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach,
and
a
host
of
other
decisions
with
respect
to
voting,
employment,
housing.
i
think
that
it
is
beyond
cavil
that
there
is
that
competence.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
yes,
i
think
so.
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
would
thereby
be
inferring,
because
it
was
enacted
by
a
state
legislature.
but
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
the
unique
competence
of
the
united
states
congress
to
address
these
issues.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
am
not
an
expert
in
that
regard,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
state
legislatures
have
very
short
terms,
they
act
in
summary
fashion
with
respect
to
legislation,
and
legislative
records
are
not
made
in
the
traditional
sense.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
yes,
they
are.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
that
is
because
this
court
has
recognized
that
legislatures'
functions
are
different
from
court
and
administrative
bodies.
they
are
representative
democracy
at
its
best;
they
are
responding
to
the
experiences
of
the
members
of
the
legislature,
hearings
that
they
may
have
had
held,
their
conversations
with
their
constituents,
and
bringing
all
of
that
information
to
bear
over
time
with
respect
to
problems
that
are
of
concern
to
that
particular
state
or
locality.
now,
that
is
the
same
process
that
the
united
states
congress
follows.
the
fact
that
we
have
committees
making
records,
holding
hearings,
making
certain
findings
from
time
to
time,
it
seems
to
me
does
not
get
to
the
core
of
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
act
without
those
types
of
findings
and
without
the
detail
that
i
think
that
petitioners
assert
is
required
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
let
me
make
a
preliminary
point,
mr.
justice
powell,
and
that
is
that
mr.
hickey
is
wrong
in
saying
that
there
were
no
definitions
of
the
minorities
included
in
the
provision,
131,
of
the
appendix.
in
guidelines
that
were
issued
by
the
economic
development
administration,
there
were
definitions
of
minorities
that
were
included
under
this
provision.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
the
act
did
not
explicitly
authorize
economic
development
administration
to
make
the
definitions
but
the
definitions
have
drawn
from
determinations
that
have
been
used
in
the
government
at
least
since
1971
with
respect
to
these
groups.
in
other
words,
the
groups
included
in
the
act,
the
groups
that
had
been
mentioned
in
a
number
of
actions
by
administrative
agencies,
and
i
think
recognized
by
the
congress.
but
to
get
back
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
powell,
on
asian-americans
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
brief
of
the
asian-american
legal
defense
fund
because
i
think
it
goes
into
more
detail
than
did
our
brief
with
respect
to
the
history
of
discrimination
against
asian-americans
in
the
country.
certainly
congress
has
dealt
with
discrimination
against
asian-americans
in
the
voting
rights
act,
most
recently
in
1975.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
would
have
to
rely
upon
the
competence
of
the
congress
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
--
to
make
those
determinations.
it
would
not
be
required
to
go
into
detail.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
yes,
that
is
our
position;
but
i
don't
think
we
need
to
be
pushed
to
that
ultimate
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
let
me
say
something,
because
i
--
this
line
of
questioning
i
find
very
disturbing
with
respect
to
asian-americans.
i
feel
that
perhaps
in
our
brief
we
did
not
give
the
type
of
attention
to
the
history
of
discrimination
against
asian-americans
that
was
deserved.
i
think
that
there
is
more
than
ample
evidence
in
our
history
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
justify
this
court
concluding
that
congress
was
acting
intelligently
and
constitutionally
in
including
asian-americans
within
the
ambit
of
this
particular
statute.
and
i
want
this
record
of
the
united
states
position
before
this
court
to
reflect
that.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
if
norwegians
were
involved?
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
yes.
well,
i
think
that
it
would
perhaps
create
more
difficulty
but
i
don't
think
as
a
constitutional
matter
it
would
be
distinguishable.
in
other
words,
when
we
are
talking
about
racial
classifications
we
are
not
urging
upon
this
court
that
the
court
should
close
its
eyes
to
the
extent
to
which
certain
types
of
classifications
have
been
used
invidiously
in
this
country.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
when
i
use
the
term
"racial,"
i
am
also
referring
to
certain
types
of
ethnic
identifications
that
have
been
used
in
this
country
for
purposes
of
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
if
congress
made
that
determination.
again,
i
think
that
an
action
of
the
congress
would
come
to
this
court
with
a
special
character.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
competence
of
congress
to
make
these
determinations
it
would
not
be
any
different.
i
think
in
terms
of
the
role
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
civil
war
amendments
one
would
have
to
ask
whether
in
providing
this
type
of
benefit
to
non-minorities
congress
was
acting
in
the
consistent
pattern
of
the
last
20
years
or
so.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
let
me
say
that
in
terms,
again,
of
the
competence
of
congress
to
make
these
determinations
it
would
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
would
not
give
a
complete
deference,
no.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
think
the
competence
of
congress
to
act
under
the
13th
and
14th
amendments
has
to
be
placed
in
the
proper
context.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
it
binds
the
states
but
congress
has
the
authority
under
section
5
to
not
only
deal
with
discrimination
by
the
states
but
also
to
prevent
discrimination
in
the
future
by
the
state.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
that
is
right.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
i
think
that
if
one
looks
at
oregon
v.
mitchell
and
also
the
katzenbach
v.
morgan
case
that
you
mentioned,
it
depends
on
one
means
by
"findings."
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
precisely,
your
honor,
think
that
the
congress
makes
determinations
from
time
to
time
and
it
has
to
be
viewed
as
a
continuing
institution.
in
oregon
v.
mitchell
i
don't
believe
that
there
were
specific
findings
that
there
had
been
discrimination
against
minorities
in
areas
other
than
the
south.
in
other
words,
no
full
record
made.
but
i
think
what
this
court
said
was
congress
would,
based
upon
what
it
already
knew
about
discrimination
flowing
from
the
use
of
literacy
tests,
could
conclude
that
leaning
literacy
tests
could
ultimately
serve
the
purposes
that
the
14th
amendment
was
designed
to
reach.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
think
it
is
significant,
mr.
justice
marshall.
it
supports
the
wisdom
of
the
framers
of
the
13th
and
14th
amendments
and
the
15th
amendment,
the
civil
war
amendments
that,
given
the
history
of
our
country,
it
would
not
be
likely
that
the
majority
would
have
to
come
to
its
own
defense,
that
those
statutes
were
designed
to
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
no,
i
think
my
answer
--
the
answer
is
"no."
but
what
i
was
trying
to
point
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
my
answer
was
in
two
parts.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
what
i
have
said,
mr.
justice
stewart.
what
i
said
was
when
we
are
talking
about
the
competence
of
congress
to
make
certain
determinations.
the
fact
that
there
are
not
full
findings
on
the
record
with
respect
to
a
certain
type
of
discrimination
and
the
need
to
remedy
that
presumptively
invalid.
but
when
we
are
looking
at
the
authority
of
the
congress
to
act
and
we
are
looking
at
the
13th
and
14th
amendments,
we
are
looking
at
the
5th
amendment
and
the
duty
of
congress
to
insure
that
federal
funds
are
not
used
in
a
way
that
either
creates
or
perpetuates
discrimination,
wherever
it
happens
to
occur
in
this
country.
then
it
seems
to
me
a
statute
that
has
to
do
with
providing
and
insuring
that
85
percent
of
the
benefits
go
to
the
whites
would
raise
some
serious
constitutional
questions.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
do
not.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
it
raises
serious
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
it
raises
serious
constitutional
questions
and
i
assume
that
is
why
the
case
is
before
this
court.
but
i
think
that
when
we
are
talking
about
congress
desiring
to
benefit
minority
contractors
by
providing
10
percent
of
a
$4
billion
program,
when
we
are
talking
a
federal
contract
program
that
involves
over
$100
billion
and
we
are
talking
about
one
program
that
lasts
for
a
year
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
no,
the
argument
is
simply
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
remedy.
this
court
i
think
has
expressed
the
view
that
when
racial
classification
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
i
think
it
is
simply
--
i
think
it
is
an
equitable
question
that
in
looking
at
what
congress
has
done
it
is
not
irrelevant
that
it
has
limited
the
thrust
and
scope
of
this
program,
as
it
did.
i
don't
think
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
stands
or
falls
on
that
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
different
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
don't
think
it
is
irrelevant,
i
don't
think
it
is
dispositive.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
that
is
correct;
and
i
think
what
this
record
reflects
is
that
congress
has
over
at
least
the
past
ten
years
experimented
with
different
approaches
to
try
to
improve
the
conditions
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
i
think
that
again
one
has
to
look
at
the
situation
in
context.
clearly,
if
there
has
been
a
history
of
systematic
discrimination
against
methodists,
then
congress
has
the
right
to
experiment
to
determine
how
to
get
at
that
particular
issue.
it
is
a
14th
amendment
violation
if
states
have
been
discriminating.
it
would
be
a
5th
amendment
violation
if
the
congress
used
funds
in
a
way
that
supported
the
continuation
of
that
discrimination.
but,
that
is
not
the
case
we
are
talking
about,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
not
at
all.
my
position
is
that
were
congress
to
decide
to
extend
this
for
5
years
or
10
years
based
upon
the
history
of
discrimination
against
blacks,
that
too
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
drew
s.
days

i
think
that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
drew
s.

that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
drew

mr.

clearly
with
respect
to
blacks
--
mr.
drew
s.
days

--
victims
of
discrimination
and
incidents
of
slavery,
the
13th
amendment
provides
an
additional
basis
for
this
legislation.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
i
think
that
while
this
court
has
not
addressed
itself
specifically
to
that
issue,
if
one
looks
at
santa
fe
railroad
case
and
the
fact
that
whites
were
deemed
to
have
been
protected
by
1981,
one
might
argue
that
other
groups
that
could
show
a
history
of
discrimination
in
this
country
might
benefit
under
the
13th
amendment.
i
am
not
prepared
to
make
that
argument
today.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
let
me
just
stay,
mr.
justice
powell,
with
the
position
that
it
clearly
can
be
used
by
congress
to
reach
discrimination
against
blacks.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
i
think
that
as
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by
a
minority
contracting
organization,
goes
into
that
in
some
detail,
as
does
the
brief
of
the
legal
defense
fund.
i
think
there
is
ample
evidence
to
support
this
extension.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
i
think
we
have
made
the
argument
that
the
13th
amendment
does
apply,
section
2
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
yes.
i
think
that
when
we
talk
about
the
15th
amendment
we
are
simply
talking
about
the
competence
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
excuse
me?
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
our
purpose
for
mentioning
the
15th
amendment
is
to
support
the
argument
of
the
special
and
unique
competence
of
congress.
that
is
the
only
reason
it
is
involved.
i
think,
your
honors,
that
what
this
case
comes
down
to
is
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
by
saying
that
there
is
no
legislative
record
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
mb
provision
are
first
wrong,
because
there
is
evidence.
there
was
evidence
in
this
record
that
in
the
hearings
with
respect
to
(2)
there
was
testimony
of
discrimination
against
minorities,
that
the
money
had
not
been
distributed
adequately
with
respect
to
minorities,
there
were
claims
of
discrimination
against
minority
contractors.
and
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
senate,
the
debates
i
think
reflect
this
understanding
by
congress,
that
there
was
not
only
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
particular
legislation
but
evidence
with
respect
to
other
attempts
by
the
congress
to
deal
with
the
disadvantaged
position
of
minority
business
enterprises.
the
approach
that
congress
took
to
achieve
this
end
--
that
is
the
10-percent
set-aside
--
was
appropriately
tailored,
in
our
estimation.
one
has
to
remember
that
this
bill
was
designed
to
pump
large
amounts
of
money
into
the
economy
very
quickly.
applications
had
to
be
approved
in
60
days
and
the
projects
had
to
be
under
way
in
90
days.
congress
therefore
had
to
adopt
measures
that
would
be
appropriate
under
these
circumstances.
we
think
that
the
10-percent
set-aside
was
reasonable
in
light
of
the
17
percent
population
of
minority
groups
in
this
country,
the
fact
that
we
are
talking
about
one
program
extending
for
one
year.
and
despite
what
the
petitioners
say,
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
intent
to
stigmatize
non-minority
contractors
and
non-minority
persons
by
the
legislation.
mr.

s.

it
would
not
have
been
different.
again
--
mr.
drew
s.
days

that
is
right.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
think
that
as
we
argue
in
our
brief
the
extent
to
which
there
might
be
other
alternatives
utilized
by
congress
in
this
situation,
they
had
been
tried
by
the
congress.
there
was
the
small
business
administration
act,
there
were
legislative
attempts
to
deal
with
minority
investment,
there
was
an
attempt
to
deal
with
bonding
for
minority
businesses.
and
what
congress
concluded
--
and
i
think
this
is
reflected
in
the
debates
on
the
minority
business
enterprise
legislation
--
that
those
have
simply
not
worked;
despite
everything
congress
had
attempted
to
do,
minority
businesses
still
remained
a
very
small
minority
of
those
involved
in
the
construction
business
and
were
getting
less
than
one
percent
of
the
federal
contract
dollar.
insofar
as
the
petitioners
have
argued
that
the
minority
business
enterprise
provision
violates
title
vi,
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
legislation
that
in
the
same
document
dealt
with
discrimination
based
upon
sex.
in
other
words,
congress
was
thinking
in
title
vi
terms
at
the
same
time
that
it
enacted
the
minority
business
enterprise
provision.
we
think
that
these
two
provisions,
that
is
the
minority
business
enterprise
provision
and
title
vi,
can
operate
in
tandem,
and
there
is
no
antagonism
between
those
particular
pieces
of
legislation.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
they
certainly
could,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
i
think
that
the
statute
was
--
demonstrates
the
extent
to
which
congress
was
trying
to
reach
several
problems
at
the
same
time
with
respect
to
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
this
is
an
area
where
congress
is
not
required
to
deal
with
the
entire
problem
at
one
time.
it
can
deal
with
what
it
regards
is
the
most
egregious
problems
at
first
and
then
move
toward
addressing
other
problems
as
it
gains
more
experience
with
resolving
the
other
problems.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
requirement
that
congress
deal
with
the
entire
problem
at
the
same
time.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
believe
it
could
have.
when
one
looks
at
the
minority
business
enterprise
provision,
what
one
sees
is
the
culmination
of
years
of
concern
by
the
congress
with
the
unique
plight
of
minority
business
enterprises.
if
we
look
at
the
general
background,
what
we
see
is
a
congress
that
for
20
years
has
been
trying
to
deal
with
various
forms
of
discrimination
based
upon
race
or
ethnic
origin.
what
we
see
is
a
congress
that
has
attempted
one
approach
and
where
it
has
found
that
that
approach
has
not
achieved
the
objective
that
was
desired,
seeking
other
approaches.
and
the
voting
rights
area
i
think
is
a
perfect
example,
starting
with
the
1957
voting
rights
act
and
moving
up
to
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
and
then
amending
that
act
in
1975.
we
see
that
in
the
employment
discrimination
legislation
in
1964
dealing
with
private
discrimination
in
employment,
and
then
in
1972,
dealing
with
discrimination
by
state
and
local
government
and
by
the
federal
government.
this
search
has
also
been
true
with
respect
to
minority
business
enterprises,
starting
with
more
general
good
faith
requirements
and
then
moving
to
this
particular
provision
that
constitutes
a
minority
set-aside
or
a
10-percent
division.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
think
that
congress
could
do
that.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
make
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
we
haven't
made
that
argument,
because
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
is
really
very
difficult
to
write
on
a
clean
slate
when
we
are
talking
about
minority
business
enterprises
in
this
country.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
think
so.
under
the
5th
amendment
i
think
congress
has
a
very
broad
authority
to
insure
that
federal
funds
are
not
used
in
a
discriminatory
manner
or
somehow
supports
discrimination
that
is
out
in
the
world.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
i
think
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
why
i
am
perfectly
comfortable
making
the
argument
that
you
suggest,
but
the
power
of
the
congress
goes
beyond
remedying
specific
identifiable
discrimination.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
we
think
that
this
case
can
stand
very
fully
on
evidence
of
past
discrimination
and
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
reach
that
particular
consideration
in
the
context
of
this
record
in
this
case.
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
could
not
expatiate
for
a
very
long
time
on
that
particular
issue.
but
i
think
that
for
people
who
are
familiar
with
the
alaskan
area
and
the
aleutian
islands
area,
and
certainly
there
are
representatives
in
the
congress
from
that
area
and
there
have
been
considerations
by
other
government
agencies
in
the
executive
branch,
that
is
reasonable
conclusion.
i
see
nothing
in
the
record
or
anywhere
else
that
would
rebut
the
assumption
there
was
discrimination
against
those
--
mr.
drew
s.
days
iii
that
is
right.
it
is
its
unique
competence
to
make
these
types
of
broad
determinations
beyond
what
accord
administrative
body
--
mr.
drew

yes.
thank
you.
