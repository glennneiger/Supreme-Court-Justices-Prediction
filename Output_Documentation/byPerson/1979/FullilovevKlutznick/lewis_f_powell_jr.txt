justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
if
they
had
done
that
you
would
suggest
that
at
least
first
leg
of
the
strict
scrutiny
test
would
be
satisfied?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
benisch
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
didn't
persuade
anyone
to
agree
with
me.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
hickey,
have
we
ever
held
the
federal
statute
unconstitutional
because
congress
didn't
make
appropriate
findings?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
a
finding
that
general
contractors
who
obtained
government
contracts
have
traditionally
discriminated
against
subcontractors
been
sufficient
to
support
the
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
comply
with
the
10-percent
requirement
if
the
state
gave
a
contract
to
a
general
who
assured
the
state
that
at
least
10
percent
of
the
money
delivered
to
subs
would
be
minority
business
enterprise?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
involved
here,
the
5th
or
the
14th
amendment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
assume
for
a
moment
that
this
section
of
the
statute
had
dealt
only
with
orientals
and
no
findings
of
any
kind
were
made.
would
you
still
view
that
the
statute
was
valid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
would
be
the
basis
for
assuming,
as
my
statement
would
require
that
you
do,
that
orientals
have
been
discriminated
against
in
the
united
states
--
all
orientals.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
anywhere
in
asia
i
suppose
would
be
included
by
the
term.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
my
question
assumed
as
a
fact
that
congress
had
not
legislated
as
it
has
for
example
in
title
vii
and
the
voting
rights
act
with
respect
say
to
other
minority
citizens.
let's
assume
you
had
a
clean
slate.
congress
decided
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
going
to
do
something
for
the
orientals,
but
made
no
findings.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
your
basic
position
is
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
have
anything
in
the
congressional
record
that
would
support
a
discriminatory
statute
enacted
by
the
congress.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
that.
i
am
just
seeing
how
far
you
would
go.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
more
fundamentally,
general
day,
would
this
case
by
different
if
the
statute
had
said
that
at
least
85
percent
of
this
money
had
to
be
spent
for
--
on
business
enterprises
that
were
owned
and
operated
by
white
people?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
if
the
statute
had
so
provided
you
think
the
constitutional
question
would
be
indistinguishable
from
the
one
now
before
us?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
suppose,
in
effect,
that
is
what
this
--
that
is
pretty
close
to
what
this
statute
does
provide.
it
provides
that
90
percent
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
the
wording
were
that
way,
do
you
think
the
question
--
the
constitutional
question
would
be
the
same?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
just
give
complete
deference
to
congress,
as
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
where
wouldn't
you;
in
what
hypothetical
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
14th
amendment
binds
only
the
states.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
perpetuating
the
14th
amendment.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
read
all
that
material
in
your
brief,
general
days
and
i
didn't
know
if
you
are
talking
--
if
this
kind
of
a
de
minimis
argument
or
an
argument
that
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
lack
standing,
or
what
is
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
can't
be
just
a
little
bit
pregnant,
you
know.
if
it
is
wrong,
it
is
wrong.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
days,
you
have
referred
several
times
to
the
13th
amendment.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
does
that
help
this
particular
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
about
the
other
categories
of
minorities?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
13th
amendment
uses
the
term
"slavery."
are
you
thinking
about
slavery
of
orientals
in
asia,
or
where?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
the
5th
and
the
14th.
i
just
wondered
why
you
refer
to
the
13th.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
leave
that
argument
to
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no,
no.
you
purport
to
rely
on
the
15th,
but
you
leave
that
argument
to
your
brief,
too,
don't
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
you
indicated
it
wouldn't
be
different
if
it
were
100
percent.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
agree.
