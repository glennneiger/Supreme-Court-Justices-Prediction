chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
fullilove
v.
juanita
kreps,
the
secretary
of
commerce.
mr.
benisch,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
speak
of
congress'
civil
rights
powers,
under
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
classify
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
congress
appropriates
money
for
aid
to
south
korea,
for
example,
under
what
clause
of
the
constitution
do
they
--
does
it
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
aid
to
south
korea.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
the
aid
to
korea
again
for
a
moment,
to
a
hypothetical
problem.
you
said
that
is
under
the
tax
and
spending
power.
there
are
also
foreign
policy
considerations
and
national
defense
considerations.
it
is
an
amalgam
of
a
number
of
considerations,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
true
in
this
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
my
question.
do
you
think
there
was
an
historical
--
was
there
historical
discrimination
in
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
stage,
mr.
benisch,
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
stage
must
these
findings
be
made,
including
the
judicial
findings
that
were
referred
to
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
at
what
stage
in
his
spectrum,
the
judicial
findings
could
not
be
made
at
the
time
of
passage
of
the
act,
of
course,
could
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
language
you
read
from
justice
powell's
opinion
referred
to
legislative
or
judicial
findings,
did
it
not?
i
am
just
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
suggesting
a
judicial
finding
could
be
made
then
only
in
the
context
of
a
judicial
proceeding
such
as
a
school
desegregation
case
where
the
proceeding
is
initiated
in
the
judicial
branch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
really
think
the
statute
would
be
valid
if
there
were
such
a
finding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
there
had
been
a
finding
that
there
had
been
previous
discrimination
against
presbyterians,
could
congress
say
that
at
least
10
percent
of
this
money
must
now
go
to
presbyterians?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fifth
is
involved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
the
religion
clauses
are
any
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
benisch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hickey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
do
that
with
students
in
schools
who
cannot
speak
english,
do
we
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
we
hold
the
statutes
unconstitutional
because
they
are
badly
drawn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
failure
to
identify
the
indians
as
american
indians,
if
that
is
what
congress
meant,
or
the
inclusion
of
orientals
as
to
whom
no
prejudice
may
perhaps
be
shown
nor
discrimination,
is
a
fatal
flaw
in
the
whole
legislation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
days.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
distinguish
the
congress
from
the
legislature
of
the
states
where
for
the
most
part
the
states
do
not
make
findings;
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
functions
are
precisely
the
same,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
not
let
the
absence
of
findings
by
a
state
legislature
impede
sustaining
the
state's
acts,
have
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
days,
suppose
the
government's
statute
were
infirm,
because
of
the
inclusion
of
orientals
there
is
no
record.
suppose
that
is
hypothetically
the
conclusion
of
a
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
it
cannot
judicially
notice
the
fact
of
discrimination
against
orientals
or
aleuts
or
indians,
because
they
haven't
specified
american
indians,
would
that
necessarily
mean
that
the
entire
statute
would
fall?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
took
your
treatment
in
the
briefs
mr.
days,
to
be
that
congress,
among
other
broad
powers,
has
the
right
to
experiment
with
certain
types
of
remedial
legislation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
constitutional
question
be
different
if
the
set-aside
had
been
25
percent,
which
is
stated
in
the
minority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
