mr.
robert
g.
benisch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
and,
indeed,
of
national
importance.
we
are
called
upon
today
for
the
first
time
to
deal
with
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
mandatory
racial
quota
imposed
by
congress
in
a
public
works
funding
act.
this
is
not
a
case
dealing
with
employment
discrimination
or
discrimination
on
the
part
of
unions
in
the
construction
industry.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
can
enact
an
outright
racial
quota
and,
if
so,
under
what
circumstances.
the
act
we
are
concerned
with
is
the
local
public
works
employment
act
where
under
(2)
$4
billion
was
appropriated
for
local
public
works
funding
throughout
the
country
in
order
to
assist
what
was
at
the
time
a
flagging
construction
industry.
just
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
appropriations
bill
representative
mitchell
proposed
an
amendment
to
the
bill
which
provided
in
substance
that
any
grantee
receiving
funds
other
than
the
act
must
assure
the
secretary
that
at
least
10
percent
of
those
monies
would
be
set
aside
and
appropriated
solely
for
the
use
of
minority
business
enterprises
as
defined
in
the
act.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
think,
your
honor,
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history
and
record
here
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
observe
what
congress
was
about
when
it
passed
the
local
public
works
employment
act.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
dealing
in
the
area
of
civil
rights
legislation
such
as
it
might
have
been
doing
when
it
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
submit,
your
honor,
none
whatsoever,
and
that
is
the
first
prong
to
my
argument,
that
indeed
an
examination
of
the
legislative
record
and
history
discloses
that
there
was
absolutely
no
finding
made
whatsoever
in
the
record
or
even
in
the
discussions,
of
found
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
non-minority
business
community
in
the
construction
industry.
now,
it
is
--
i
think
it
is
critical
to
note
at
the
outset
here
that
in
its
recent
decision
this
court
in
personnel
administrator
of
massachusetts
v.
feeney
held
that
a
racial
classification
regardless
of
purported
motivation
is
presumptively
invalid
and
can
be
upheld
only
upon
a
showing
of
extraordinary
justification.
i
submit
that
with
that
presumption
of
invalidity
in
mind
it
is
therefore
incumbent
on
the
government
in
this
action
to
rebut
that
presumption
because
we
are
dealing
purely
and
simply
with
a
racial
classification
required
across
the
board
and
mandatory.
now,
we
submit
here
that
neither
the
government
nor
the
courts
below
have
cited
any
authority
which
rebuts
the
presumption
and
validity
of
that
racial
classification.
for
purposes
of
my
argument
here
today,
petitioners
will
concede
that
if
the
racial
classification
or
the
amendment
to
the
act
were
to
pass
what
has
become
known
as
the
strict
scrutiny
test,
it
might
be
held
that
the
presumption
is
rebutted.
now,
the
strict
scrutiny
test
has
two
prongs,
as
we
know.
the
first
is
there
must
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest
behind
the
passage
of
the
act
or
the
legislation
in
question;
and,
secondly,
the
means
used
or
the
mechanism
must
be
the
least
intrusive
or
onerous
available.
now,
as
to
the
compelling
government
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
your
honor,
the
spending
power,
the
cases
have
held
that
congress
cannot
spend
the
taxpayers'
money
which
is
collected
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis.
congress
can't
spend
it
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
but
without
getting
cute
about
it,
if
you
will,
i
am
simply
saying
that
whatever
congress
does
with
respect
to
monies
or
any
passage,
it
must
do
in
a
constitutional
manner.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
most
certainly
do.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
legislation
affects
in
any
way
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
being
passed.
in
other
words,
whether
congress
is
acting
under
its
spending
powers,
whether
it
is
acting
under
its
civil
rights
powers,
or
whatever,
whatever
it
does
must
be
done
in
--
pursuant
to
the
constitution.
that
is,
it
cannot
violate
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
cannot
--
it
must
act
in
accordance
with
the
strictures
and
prescriptions
of
the
constitution.
we
submit
that
in
this
case
congress
--
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
has
acted
in
accordance
with
the
constitution;
and,
in
fact,
we
believe
that
it
has
violated
article
5
of
that
constitution.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
well,
there
would
be
the
13th
amendment,
your
honor,
and
those
amendments
that
have
become
known
as
the
civil
war
amendments.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
when
it
appropriates
money
for
south
korea?
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
well,
it
is
under
its
spending
powers.
and
i
believe
that
what
we
are
faced
with
here
is
their
having
been
endrafted
on
a
funding
bill,
an
11th
hour
after
thought;
and
when
we
look
at
the
legislative
record
we
have
the
sponsor's
statement
as
follows
we
spend
a
great
deal
of
federal
money
under
the
sba
program
creating,
strengthening
and
supporting
minority
businesses.
yet,
when
it
comes
down
to
giving
those
minority
businesses
a
piece
of
the
action
the
federal
government
is
sorely
remiss.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
as
proposed
by
mr.
mitchell
was
to
give
the
minority
business
community
a
share
of
the
action.
now,
congress
sat
down,
it
was
appropriating
$400
million,
and
it
said,
$400
million
for
minority
business
enterprises
is
not
going
to
hurt
anybody
and
we
ought
to
give
them
a
piece
of
the
action.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
that
would
be
true.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
your
honor,
the
key
word
here
is
"racial
classification."
in
other
words,
we
have
an
amalgam
here,
or
perhaps
an
amalgam.
but
one
of
the
ingredients
or
one
of
the
facets
of
this
act
that
we
are
dealing
with
today
is
the
imposition
of
a
mandatory
racial
classification
quota.
now,
that
fact
alone
puts
this
case
in
a
completely
unique
position
to
my
knowledge
to
date.
i
have
not
--
i
am
not
aware
of
any
prior
act
of
congress
which
engendered
a
mandatory
racial
classification
across
the
board.
it
is
not
a
good
faith
effort,
it
is
mandatory.
and
i
think,
your
honor,
that
is
the
key
distinction
in
this
case.
the
decisions
of
the
court
below
indicate
that
congress
perhaps
could
have
taken
note
of
historical
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry
in
the
context
of
this
passing
this
act
and
therefore
pass
what
it
considered
to
be
a
remedial
statute.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
the
courts
below
indicated
that;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
your
honor,
we
are
dealing
here
--
and
this
is
not
slicing
the
meat
that
thin.
we
are
dealing
here
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
in
the
construction
industry
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so
with
respect
to
non-minority
businesses
discriminating
against
minority
businesses
--
even
the
entrepreneur
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
are
you
saying
in
the
legislative
record
to
the
act,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
that
is
so,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
this
that
if
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
no,
i
wouldn't
in
this
regard,
if
i
may
answer
that.
i
believe
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
bakke
that
there
must
be,
where
you
have
a
racial
classification,
there
must
be
some
findings
--
made
findings
made
by
the
legislative
body
in
order
to
support
the
legislation
in
question.
that
is
the
racial
classification.
and
i
am
referring
specifically
to
the
following
language
of
justice
powell's
opinion.
we
have
never
approved
a
classification
that
aids
persons
perceived
as
members
of
relatively
victimized
groups
at
the
expense
of
other
innocent
individuals
in
the
absence
of
judicial,
legislative
or
administrative
findings
of
constitutional
or
statutory
violations.
after
such
findings
have
been
made,
the
governmental
interest
in
preferring
members
of
the
injured
group
at
the
expense
of
others
is
substantial,
since
the
legal
rights
of
the
victims
must
be
vindicated.
in
such
a
case
the
extent
of
the
injury
and
the
consequent
remedy
will
have
been
judicially,
legislatively
or
administratively
defined.
also,
the
remedial
action
usually
remains
subject
to
continuing
oversight
to
insure
that
it
will
work
the
least
possible
harm
to
other
innocent
persons
competing
for
the
benefit.
without
such
findings
of
constitutional
or
statutory
violations,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
government
has
any
greater
interest
in
helping
one
individual
than
in
refraining
from
harming
another.
thus,
the
government
has
no
compelling
justification
for
inflicting
such
harm.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
sir?
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
do.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
sir?
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
at
what
stage
of
the
passage
of
the
act?
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
have
no
challenge
of
that,
yes.
but
the
legislative
findings
are
what
we
are
dealing
with.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
well,
but
it
was
talking
there
--
it
was
talking
across
the
board.
in
other
words,
depending
upon
the
body
that
was
acting,
it
was
in
accordance
with
judicial
--
congress
and
its
administrative
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
am
submitting
that
where
there
is
a
challenge
mounted
to
the
particular
activity
or
action
passed
by
congress,
for
example,
that
a
judicial
finding
could
be
made;
and
that
is
what
we
are
asking
for
here.
if
a
finding
be
made
that
congress
has
made
--
has
in
fact
made
no
findings
sufficient
to
support
the
racial
classification
involved
in
the
amendment
to
the
act.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
no,
i
don't
believe
congress
would
have
to
make
the
detailed
findings,
for
example,
such
as
findings
of
fact
might
require
on
a
trial.
congress
can
paint
with
a
broad
brush.
but
i
submit
it
cannot
tar
an
entire
industry
with
an
even
broader
brush
in
order
to
pass
a
racial
classification.
and
that
is
what
it
has
done
here.
it
has
tarred
the
entire
construction
industry
with
the
reputation
attributed
to
title
7
actions
which,
for
the
most
part,
dealt
with
union
discrimination
against
workers.
we
are
here
dealing
with
businesses
against
businesses.
and
there
has
been
no
finding
whatsoever
of
discrimination
in
that
area.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
a
finding
for
example
--
take
it
at
the
basic
level
--
a
finding
that
there
had
been
a
perceived
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination
on
the
part
of
non-minority
businesses
in
the
construction
industry
to
exclude
from
participation
non-minority
--
minority
businesses.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
if
there
were
would
be,
your
honor,
because
we
are
not
saying
--
i
am
not
arguing
here
today
that
congress
has
no
power
perhaps
to
enact
remedial
legislation
or
that
racial
quotas
are
per
se
invalid.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
if
you
consider
the
rights
of
presbyterians
to
be
a
constitutional
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
understand.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
that
is
correct.
now,
we
are
talking
here
of
--
we
are
talking,
we
are
talking
of
findings.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
we
have
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
am
very
sorry,
i
have
misplaced
-
i
have
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
in
this
case
i
am
speaking
of?
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
if
it
was
presbyterians,
if
it
--
if
presbyterians
were
viewed
by
congress
to
be
a
minority
which
was
entitled
to
protection,
yes.
if
you
want
to
substitute
presbyterians
from
minority
business
enterprises,
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
it.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
well,
the
fact
there
is
a
separation
between
church
and
state
would
be
a
consideration.
but
i
believe
that
the
fact
you
are
presbyterian
doesn't
mean
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
equal
protection.
and
if
you
have
been
discriminated
against
i
think
you
are
entitled
to
some
remedial
legislation.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
we
are
dealing
here
with
findings
which
relate
to
and
deal
with
compelling
governmental
interest
and
i
don't
think
that
a
democrat,
republican
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
such
as
racial
discrimination
might
be.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
well,
congress
has
perceived,
and
i
think
it
is
indeed
well
known
that
racial
discrimination
is
violative
of
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
well,
i
would
not
be
prepared
to
concede
that
point.
you
haven't
got
in
that
regard
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
well,
you
haven't
--
i
think
--
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
if
you
--
i
think
it
might
--
the
congress
may
be
mis-using
its
spending
powers.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
your
honor,
my
point
was
that
the
initial
funding
for
the
republicans
in
your
example
would
not
have
been
proper;
it
would
have
been
a
mis-use
of
the
spending
powers.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
the
remedy
therefore
to
make
up
and
help
the
democrats
will
simply
be
compounding
the
wrong.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
well,
the
cure
is
as
bad
as
the
ill
in
this
--
in
that
example.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
in
this
case,
yes,
the
cure
is,
because
we
are
not
with
a
situation
in
this
case
where
congress
has
acknowledged
and
perceived
a
violation
of
the
constitution
on
the
entrepreneurial
level
in
the
construction
industry.
it
simply
is
a
piece
of
the
action
for
the
minority
business
enterprises.
that
is
what
it
is.
let's
spread
some
of
this
money
around.
that
is
not
sufficient
to
support
a
racial
quota,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
g.
benisch
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
