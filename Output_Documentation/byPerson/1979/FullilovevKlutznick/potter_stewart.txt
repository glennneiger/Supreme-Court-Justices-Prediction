such
a
statute
would
be
valid
a
statute
that
in
words
placed
a
requirement
that
85
percent
of
the
business
go
to
whites?
that
is
a
quite
different
statute,
even
though
practically
it
may
work
out
the
same.
if
you
say
that
the
blacks
shall
be
eligible
for
only
15
percent
of
the
business,
you
would
support
that
statute,
i
don't
think
you
have
considered
your
answer
very
carefully.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
say
that
statute
would
be
constitutional?
justice

stewart
well,
it
wasn't
just
debating
a
question.
it
seems
to
me
quite
a
fundamental
question
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
"yes"
and
now
it
is
"no."
