is
it
your
view
that
you
would
expect
the
congress
the
sort
of
detailed
findings
that
one
normally
expects
a
court
or
an
administrative
body
to
make?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
benisch,
what
sort
of
findings
would
justify
this
statute;
would
they
have
to
found
that
the
government
was
guilty
of
discrimination
against
minority
business
enterprises
or
that
there
was
private
discrimination?
what
are
the
kinds
of
findings
that
you
think
would
have
saved
the
statute,
in
your
view?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
i
think
you
are
correct
that
your
brothers
did
concede
that.
but
of
course
that
doesn't
bind
us,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
decide
this
case,
even
if
they
conceded
their
whole
case
away.
