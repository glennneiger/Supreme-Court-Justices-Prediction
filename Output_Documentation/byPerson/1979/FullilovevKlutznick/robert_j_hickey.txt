mr.
robert
j.
hickey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
my
co-petitioner
counsel
mentioned
at
the
start
of
his
argument,
this
case
is
of
historical
importance,
it
is
of
practical
importance,
and
it
does
not
come
to
this
court
without
antecedents.
only
25
years
ago
this
court
in
the
dunn
decision,
brown
v.
board
of
education,
condemning
a
theory
of
separate
but
equal.
today
we
are
asked
to
say
that
quotas
are
good.
what
are
quotas?
essentially
it
is
a
form
of
sufferatism.
you
are
carving
out
a
people,
a
group,
and
saying
that
they
need
special
treatment,
or
should
receive
special
treatment.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
that
has
been
done
to
remedy
certain
problems.
but
we
start
with
the
theory
--
and
i
think
that
is
where
we
all
must
start
--
the
theory
is
that
separatism
based
on
race
is
bad,
unless
there
is
a
compelling
reason
for
some
remedy.
you
have
to
focus
on
it.
we
go
back
beyond
brown.
we
go
back
65
years
to
a
case
truax
v.
raich,
in
fact
in
some
way
someone
could
say
is
identical
to
this
situation,
although
from
a
lawyer's
view-point
you
could
easily
distinguish
any
case.
but
truax
is
an
interesting
case
because
65
years
ago
a
statute
was
passed,
a
statute
which
for
employers
in
a
particular
state
a
requirement
was
imposed
upon
them
that
if
they
had
five
or
more
employees,
80
percent
of
their
employees
had
to
be
native
americans.
twenty
percent
could
be
anything.
a
resident
alien
suit,
this
court
struck
it
down
on
the
grounds
that
it
denied
that
individual
a
fundamental
right
to
engage
in
business.
now,
what
we
have
done
here
is
reverse
the
quota.
instead
of
having
80
percent
for
native
americans
we
have
turned
it
around
and
given
10
percent
for
blacks,
the
spanish-speaking,
orientals,
alaskans.
why?
why
this
statute?
well,
looking
at
the
10
percent,
you
talk
about
a
statute
that
is
infringing
upon
the
rights
of
a
particular
class,
of
giving
rights.
it
is
interesting
to
note
a
few
things
about
the
statute.
it
talks
of
10
percent
nationwide.
why
10
percent?
why
not
4
percent,
which
is
the
number
of
black
contractors
in
the
united
states?
why
not
17
or
25
percent
in
new
york,
or
2
percent
in
arizona?
why
are
women
and
other
minorities
excluded?
why
are
orientals
included?
the
government
in
this
case
two
years
ago
in
bakke
came
to
this
court
and
said
there
is
no
discrimination
against
orientals.
in
the
very
brief
they
filed
in
this
case,
the
appendix
gives
all
the
statistics
regarding
whites,
hispanics,
and
doesn't
show
any
discrimination
against
orientals,
the
picking
and
choosing
and
no
explanation.
but
go
further,
they
use
terms
like
"spanish
speaking."
they
are
not
saying
hispanics.
they
are
saying
spanish
speaking.
even
the
government
in
other
contexts
have
dropped
that
word
because,
even
though
i
didn't
do
very
well
in
school
in
languages,
i
could
be
spanish
speaking.
and
the
government
dropped
it
in
other
contexts
because
of
that.
it
was
used
for
that
purpose.
even
if
you
took
a
term
like
"hispanic,"
there
is
no
explanation
as
to
who
is
hispanic.
the
government
in
other
contexts
have
said
portugese
from
portugal
are
not
hispanics,
but
portugese
from
brazil
up.
we
have
all
of
these
questions,
but
no
answers.
i
am
not
saying
there
can't
be
answers,
but
when
you
get
down
to
a
question
like
indians,
this
court
in
previous
terms
has
considered
who
is
and
who
is
not
an
indian,
different
kinds
of
indians,
tribal
indians,
indians
living
off
and
on
reservations
at
different
times.
despite
the
stereotype
you
see
on
television,
if
you
see
an
indian
walking
down
the
street
in
washington
without
any
tribal
head
dress,
you
could
not
segregate
him
out
from
the
populous.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
and
that
also,
the
statute
does
not
even
say
what
indians
they
are
talking
about.
there
is
also
a
little
interesting
thing
that
there
is
a
set-aside
of
2-1/2
percent
for
work
done
on
tribal
lands.
is
that
2-1/2
percent
above
the
10
percent,
is
it
2-1/2
part
of
the
10
percent?
i
raise
these
questions
to
show
that
this
was
a
hastily
drawn
statute,
extremely
hastily
drawn.
basic
definitions
were
left
out,
groups
were
included
without
any
reason,
groups
were
excluded
without
any
reason
at
all.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
i
think
--
i
would
love
to
answer
as
a
practicing
attorney,
but
i
am
too
realistic
to
believe
otherwise.
i
think
when
you
talk
about
creating
a
statute
in
an
area
like
race,
i
think
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
legislature
to
take
the
added
time
to
draw
a
carefully
drawn
statute
so
everyone
knows
what
they
are
talking
about.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
this
is
the
first
round
of
this.
this
was
added
on
(2)
of
the
act,
so
this
is
the
first
round.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
congress
unfortunately
has
done
it
more
than
once
but
has
not
come
up
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
congress
as
far
as
using
definitions
--
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
well,
it
has
a
small
business
set
aside,
it
has
had
that
for
a
number
of
years.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
1977.
that
is
when
it
was
first
enacted.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
well,
that
is
the
point,
the
funds
are
still
going
out.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
there
is
still
monies
being
paid
out.
there
are
various
levels
of
a
construction
job,
as
one
part
of
a
job
is
completed
another
job
takes
its
place
and
the
jobs
are
still
going
on.
these
are
massive
projects.
they
are
still
going
on
throughout
the
country.
the
thing
here
is
this.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
in
this
legislation
it
is.
when
you
are
talking
about
some
legislative
findings
in
drafting
a
statute,
when
you
add
in
an
area
classification
based
on
race,
let
us
assume
everything
else
is
okay
about
it,
which
we
disagree,
i
think
at
a
minimum
you
have
to
explain
to
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
subject
to
that
statute
who
is
in
fact
covered
by
it.
i
think
that
is
a
minimum.
i
think
--
and
it
is
not
in
here.
there
is
no
definitions
of
any
of
these
terms.
but
going
back
to
another
item,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
the
fact
that
whether
there
was
a
sort
of
general
discussion,
general
findings
of
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry,
absent
the
legislative
history
in
this
particular
act.
and
the
answer
is,
"no."
they
talk
about
discrimination,
voting,
employment,
there
is
nowhere
any
finding
under
any
other
act,
of
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry.
now,
if
there
were
that,
just
remember
who
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
general
contractor.
he
is
the
one
at
the
bottom
getting
the
work.
the
discrimination
has
to
be
by
the
federal
government
and
the
state
grantees,
the
local
grantees.
there
is
no
finding
anywhere.
i
find
it
somewhat
strange
that
the
government
is
here
on
this
case
because
to
accomplish
what
they
would
want,
they
would
have
to
convince
you
that
they
in
fact
have
discriminated,
they,
the
government,
this
is
a
governmental
program.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
the
federal
government
pulls
the
strings.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
and
if
the
states
discriminate,
it
is
because
the
federal
government
allows
it.
there
is
not
even
--
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
that
is
right,
and
it
hasn't
allowed
it
and
it
hasn't
occurred.
nowhere
in
there,
and
this
is
a
minimum
finding
i
would
think,
that
the
federal
government
either
has
discriminated
itself
or
allowed
the
states
to
discriminate
in
its
programs.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
unfortunately,
i
would
say
"no."
and,
on
the
other
hand,
i
can't
say
that
the
court
really
has
faced
this
issue.
i
think
the
court
has
talked
about
it,
it
talked
about
it
in
the
hampton
case
and
it
has
i
think
talked
about
it
indirectly
or
impliedly
in
other
cases,
but
when
you
are
talking
about
an
issue
of
a
classification
based
on
race
or
a
national
origin
or
a
denial
of
a
fundamental
right,
i
don't
know
if
this
court
has
ever
really
faced
it.
this
is
what
you
are
being
asked
to
face
today.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
oh,
i
think
that
the
reverse
is
definitely
true,
it
is
that
the
court
has
sustained
action
legislation
on
the
basis
of
findings
made
by
them.
that
isn't
what
we
have
today.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
i
would
say
not,
because
discrimination
is
not
at
that
level,
discrimination
is
on
the
federal
government
and
the
state
level
government.
but,
again,
there
was
no
findings
in
this
litigation
--
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
that
is
why
we
are
here
today,
we
believe
that
is
a
violation
of
the
14th
amendment.
that
would
be
discrimination,
that
is
our
very
purpose.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
the
5th
through
the
14th
amendment.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
the
due
process
equal
protection
clause
is
extended
from
the
14th
through
the
5th
amendment
to
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
right.
and
we
also
have
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
we
do
have
both,
federal
and
state,
in
this
case.
the
state
people
are
joined
--
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
you
said
that
in
the
loving
case
as
well.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
and
the
14th.
both
the
5th
as
to
the
federal
government
and
the
14th
as
to
the
state
grantees.
mr.
robert
j.
hickey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
