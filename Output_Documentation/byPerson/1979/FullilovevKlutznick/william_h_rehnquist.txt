justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
benisch,
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
argument
whether
congress
was
acting
under
its
authority
to
tax
and
spend
or
whether
it
was
acting
under
its
authority
to
enforce
the
14th
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
congress
in
this
particular
act
make
any
findings
as
to
discrimination
in
the
employment
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can't
congress
just
spend
the
money
it
raises
by
taxation
in
the
manner
it
deems
best?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
one
doubts
that.
but
do
you
think
that
congress
is
under
the
same
strictures
when
it
simply
grants
money
as
it
is
when
it
regulates
private
industry
in
a
constitutional
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
a
"take
note
of
the
historical
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
there
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
us
assume
there
had
been
that
kind
of
discrimination
in
the
construction
industry
and
it
was
all
over
the
congressional
record
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
hearings
in
some
other
legislation.
and
people
in
congress
you
assume
knew
about
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
said
in
another
--
you
suggest
that
in
this
act
they
would
have
to
specifically
take
note
of
those
facts
and
say
that
this
is
the
reason
we
are
passing
this
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
in
other
words,
if
congress
had
made
--
had
conducted
hearings
and
had
made
a
determination
that
indeed
there
was
this
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination
on
the
entrepreneurial
level,
i
submit
that
it
might
be
--
it
might
rebut
the
presumption.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
against
presbyterians?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
less
so
in
the
context
of
justice
stevens'
question
than
in
the
racial
context?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
by
hypothesis
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
justice
stevens'
question,
as
i
took
it,
took
congress
to
perceiving
that
discrimination
between
republicans
and
democrats
was
violative
of
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
be,
but
congress
has
done
it
twice,
hasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
set
aside
we
are
talking
about
only
been
enacted
once?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
is
still
going
on,
the
funds
are
still
going
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
there
been
some
more
monies
appropriated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
katzenbach
v.
morgan,
certainly
the
opinion
relied
upon
the
fact
that
congress
had
made
findings,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
bolling
v.
sharpe,
which
was
the
companion
case
to
brown
v.
board
of
education,
the
court
held
that
there
was
an
equal
protection
component
of
the
5th
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
but,
so
what
is
involved,
the
5th?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
claim
is
that
the
federal
government
is
compelling
the
states
to
violate
the
14th?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
authority
do
you
rely
on
for
that,
general
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
there
were
cases
in
this
court
that
had
noted
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
which
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
if
a
state
had
made
similar
findings
under
its
police
power
and
enacted
exactly
the
same
law,
it
would
have
stood
on
a
region
footing
in
the
congressional
enactment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
authorized
to
make
those
definitions
by
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
congress
had
said
included
among
the
other
people
to
whom
the
set-aside
was
to
be
benefited,
norwegian
americans.
and
one
could
only
conclude
that
its
action
was
totally
irrational
as
opposed
to
your
statement
that
it
was
acting
rationally
in
the
oriental
american,
because
norwegian
american
contractors
were
very
successful
and
they
probably
had
gotten
more
than
their
share
of
that
business.
would
that
make
this
statute
different
in
constitutional
terms?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
american
citizens
of
norwegian
ancestry.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
talking
just
about
racial
classification.
spanish-speaking
is
not
a
racial
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
we
ever
upheld
a
case
where
congress
enacted
a
statute
pursuant
to
the
enforcement
powers
granted
under
the
14th
amendment
where
there
weren't
congressional
findings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
weren't
there
findings
or
declarations
that
the
congress
finds
such
and
such
--
maybe
boiler
plate,
but
nonetheless
findings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
congress
has
the
power
to
experiment
by
saying
that
50
percent
of
this
$400
billion
or
$200
billion
shall
go
to
methodist
subcontractors?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
had
a
feeling
that
you
are
kind
of
saying
that
maybe
at
an
extreme
this
case
would
be
bad
but,
since
it
is
only
10
percent
and
it
is
a
fairly
small
amount
of
the
total
proportion,
congress
can
kind
of
experiment
and
tailor
the
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
were
to
decide
that
it
was
a
100-percent
set-aside,
not
a
10-percent
set-aside?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wouldn't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
women
come
in
and
say
that
the
statute
was
under-inclusive
because
it
failed
to
include
them
in
the
set-aside?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
they
successfully
do
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it
have
simply
dealt
with
oriental
contractors
and
not
with
black
or
spanish-speaking
contractors?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
there
has
been
past
invidious
discrimination
against
the
aleuts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
basically
up
to
congress,
then,
who
is
going
to
be
included?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
evaluates
the
past
invidious
discrimination
failure
to
get
a
piece
of
the
action?
