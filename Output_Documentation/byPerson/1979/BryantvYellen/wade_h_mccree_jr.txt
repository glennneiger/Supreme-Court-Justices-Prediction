mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
views
this
case
as
essentially
one
of
statutory
construction
requiring
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
congress
intended
to
exempt
the
boulder
canyon
project
from
the
excess
acreage
limitation
that
has
been
an
important
part
of
reclamation
law
since
the
enactment
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902.
central
to
legislation
to
dispose
of
the
public
lands
has
been
a
commitment
to
attempt
to
establish
an
independent
yeomanry
of
small
family
farms.
this
was
first
evidenced
as
early
as
1862
in
the
homestead
act
which
provided
an
acreage
limitation
of
160
for
a
single
holding.
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
this
acreage
limitation
would
not
apply
in
the
arid
lands
as
the
plain
states
were
occupied
because
160
acres
was
too
small
a
holding
for
grazing
and
the
average
homesteader
lacked
the
capital
resources
to
permit
irrigation.
there
was
a
short
lived
desert
land
act
of
1897,
with
an
expanded
maximum
acreage
allowance
of
640
acres,
but
this
was
abused
when
speculators
began
to
amass
large
tracts
by
what
has
been
characterized
by
one
writer
as
fraudulent
evidence
of
water
having
been
brought
onto
the
land.
someone
would
bring
a
pail
of
water
and
spill
it
and
that
affidavit
would
follow
and
the
land
would
be
given
to
the
speculator.
with
this
prelude
and
against
the
backdrop
of
the
drought
decade
of
1886,
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
was
enacted
with
a
limitation
of
160
acres
as
the
maximum
amount
of
private
land
in
single
ownership
that
is
eligible
to
receive
water
from
a
reclamation
project.
the
reclamation
act
was
amended
and
strengthened
in
a
series
of
successive
statutes
that
culminated
in
the
omnibus
adjustment
act
of
1926.
section
46
of
which
provided
in
part
that
no
water
should
be
delivered
upon
the
completion
of
a
new
project
until
a
contract
shall
have
been
entered
into
between
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
an
irrigation
district
providing
for
repayment
of
the
project
cost
and
providing
for
recordable
contracts
to
be
entered
into
by
the
holders
of
excess
acreage,
that
is
to
say,
acreage
in
excess
of
160
acres
for
an
appraisal
of
the
excess
by
the
secretary
and
an
agreement
by
the
owner
of
the
excess
to
dispose
of
this
property
under
terms
fixed
by
the
secretary
and
at
prices
not
to
exceed
the
appraised
value.
i
think
we
would
differ
with
my
brother
who
has
argued
earlier
and
perhaps
with
the
respondents
who
will
follow
us
in
this
respect
we
read
section
46
to
provide
that
the
secretary
should
not
appraise
it
at
the
desert
price,
as
was
stated,
but
at
a
price
that
would
not
take
cognizance
of
the
improvement
of
the
project,
and
in
the
case
of
the
imperial
valley
where
there
was
water
previous
to
the
boulder
project,
that
that
would
be
the
value
of
the
land,
the
land
favored
by
that
water,
irrigated
by
that
water
which
would
be
less,
we
submit,
than
the
value
of
the
land
receiving
the
boulder
dam
water
which
was
more
regular,
more
dependable
and
not
subject
to
the
vagaries
of
our
foreign
affairs
with
our
neighbor
to
the
south.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
adjudicated
protected
right,
that's
right,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
our
reading
of
this
requirement
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
which
makes
the
windfall
not
as
great.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
not
exactly.
it
says
the
landowner
can
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
the
land
will
be
appraised
according
to
its
value
as
irrigated
by
that
water.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
as
it
was
irrigated
under
the
alamo
canal
project.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
the
water
that
is
received
now
is
different
from
in
many
respects
in
the
form
and
manner
in
which
it
is
delivered
from
the
water
that
was
received
earlier.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
presently
perfected
right
is
water
to
which
the
irrigation
district
is
entitled.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
each
owner
is
entitled
to
have
his
land
appraised
for
the
purpose
of
section
46
of
the
omnibus
act
according
to
its
value
before
the
boulder
project
was
completed.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
i
think
it
is
significant
here
to
consider
what
happened
before
the
boulder
project
was
enacted.
judge
warrenburg
recounts
this
history
in
his
opinion,
the
opinion
which
is
before
the
court
now.
and
of
course,
the
colorado
river
as
it
flowed
south
roughly
along
the
boundary
of
arizona
and
california
flowed
into
mexico
and
through
mexico
into
the
gulf
of
california.
through
the
efforts
of
the
predecessors
of
the
imperial
irrigation
district,
some
of
its
water
was
diverted
into
a
dry
river
bed,
the
alamo
river,
which
preceded
west
and
then
northerly
into
what
is
now
the
imperial
valley
where
there
was
a
decline
of
the
land
northward,
and
it
irrigated
that
valley
before
this
project
works
of
boulder
dam,
now
the
hoover
dam,
and
lake
mead
and
the
other
project
works
were
established.
these
lands
received
that
water
prior
to
this
project,
but
not
under
the
circumstances
they
receive
it
now.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
sure
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
history
of
this
project
when
in
1905
the
colorado
river
breached
its
banks
and
flowed
north
in
such
abundance
that
it
almost
washed
out
the
imperial
valley,
went
into
the
saltan
sink
and
created
the
current
saltan
sea,
333,000
acres
of
water,
and
this
still
persists
since
1905.
then
there
were
drought
periods
where
there
was
no
water
available
to
the
lands
and
the
uncertainty
of
having
the
lands
flooded
as
dramatically
as
they
were
when
the
saltan
sea
was
created
or
dry
because
the
river
was
not
dependable
during
the
summer
months
is
the
difference
between
what
this
project
meant
to
the
imperial
valley
and
what
was
there
previous
to
its
enactment.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
suppose
we
would
take
the
same
position
based
on
the
statute.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct,
the
right
is
the
right
of
the
district
and
not
the
individual
owners.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
because
section
46
of
the
omnibus
adjustment
act
provided
that
no
water
should
be
delivered
from
a
reclamation
project
to
any
single
ownership
exceeding
160
acres.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
this
is
our
understanding
of
the
law.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
where
there
is
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
statute
provides
--
this
is
section
46
of
the
omnibus
adjustment
act
--
that
upon
proof
of
fraudulent
representation
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
authorized
to
cancel
water
rights.
so
whether
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
want
to
think
about
that.
the
impact
of
the
excess
acreage
requirement
isn't
as
draconian
as
it
sounds.
for
example,
a
husband
and
wife
can
each
have
160
acres
and
work
that
land
together
and
they
would
be
entitled
to
receive
water
from
the
reclamation
project.
a
family
with
adult
children
might
be
permitted
to
have
160
acres
for
each
spouse
and
each
child
who
was
a
resident
and
who
worked
the
land.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
also
applied
the
160-acre
limitation
to
cover
a
trust
where
a
trustee
holds
land
for
more
than
one
beneficiary
and
each
beneficiary
can
have
land
up
to
160
acres.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
have
this
assurance,
that
after
the
breakup
of
the
excess
acreage
and
after
more
than
one-half
or
at
least
one-half
of
the
project
works
have
been
paid
for,
the
price
limitation
does
not
apply
to
subsequent
sales
of
the
property
and
the
statute
so
provides
also
in
section
46
of
the
omnibus
adjustment
act
of
1926.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
know
of
no
prohibition
against
that.
i
can't
direct
you
to
a
statute
that
would
forbid
that
or
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
secretary
to
handle,
as
we
understand.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
our
position.
he
had
authority
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
the
imperial
district,
there
is
no
question
about
his
having
that
authority.
we
contend
that
the
contract
should
have
provided
for
the
excess
acreage
limitation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
did
not.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
prohibit
the
making
of
the
contract,
but
it
would
prohibit
the
delivery
of
the
water
pursuant
to
such
a
contract,
that's
correct.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
since
the
project
began
in
the
early
1930's.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
an
effort
was
subsequently
made
to
have
the
contract
amended
to
conform
with
the
statute.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
this
was
first
about
1964,
i
believe,
efforts
were
made
to
have
the
contract
reformed
to
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
from
about
1931
until
1964,
we
submit
that
the
administration
of
the
waters
from
this
boulder
project
was
contrary
to
congressional
authorization
and
direction.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
water
was
not
paid
for.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
irrigation
district
was
required
to
pay
for
the
construction
of
the
all-american
canal,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
all-american
canal
had
several
power
drops
along
the
way
and
the
electricity
that
was
generated
in
these
power
drops
was
attributed
to
its
share
of
the
cost
of
the
project
works.
as
a
consequence,
they
paid
nothing
for
this
water
which
has
created
the
most
desirable
farmland
certainly
in
that
part
of
the
country,
if
not
in
the
entire
country.
it
hasn't
cost
anything,
and
we
say
this
for
their
assertion
of
reliance
and
their
detrimental
reliance
and
the
dire
consequences
that
would
result.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
could
have
been
expressly
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
it
would
have
been
expressly
exempted.
as
this
court
said
in
ivanhoe
irrigation,
where
a
particular
project
has
been
exempted
because
of
its
peculiar
circumstances,
the
congress
has
always
made
such
an
exemption
by
express
enactment,
and
that
would
have
been
the
thing
to
do
because
they
are
not
going
to
build
a
project
where
one
is
not
required,
and
one
would
not
have
been
required
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
was,
there
is
no
question
about
it,
but
we
say
it
was
wrong,
it
was
contrary
to
the
direction
of
the
congress.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
characterize
it
that
far,
but
we
do
say
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
congressional
direction.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
once
in
hensley
v.
union
planters
bank
that
wisdom
sometimes
never
comes,
so
we
should
not
reject
it
just
because
it
comes
late.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
is
significant,
but
we
still
say
that
the
remedy
is
in
the
congress
and
not
in
the
court,
and
judge
wallenberg,
writing
for
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
that
in
the
opinion
below
which
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
affirm.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
i
make
that
assumption,
i
would
agree
i
think
with
the
conclusion
that
you
would
draw,
but
i
don't
make
that
assumption
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--
because
the
statute
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
should
be
corrected
because
there
has
been
a
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
omnibus
adjustment
act
that
gives
me
any
encouragement
in
that
area.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
only
one
brief
remark
in
rebuttal.
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
the
passage
of
s.
14
in
the
senate
and
has
stated
that
if
there
is
any
unfairness
here
it
should
be
the
congress
to
deal
with
it,
and
the
respondents
have
made
the
same
argument.
i
would
like
to
advise
this
court
that
when
the
landowners
of
imperial
valley
first
went
to
congress,
they
could
not
have
known
in
advance
that
this
court
would
eventually
grant
certiorari.
and
when
a
bill
was
pending
in
congress
two
years
ago
they
did
take
efforts
to
seek
a
provision
dealing
explicitly
with
them,
but
that
does
not
render
the
was
before
this
court.
the
present
administration
be
taken
the
position
consistently
in
congress
and
the
proceedings
on
s.
14
that
congress
should
not.
secretary
andrus
has
three
times
congress
it
should
not
act
because
it
should
be
decided
by
this
court,
and
i
quote
from
secretary
andrus'
testimony
in
to
the
senate
committee
on
energy
and
natural
resources.
"i
would
prefer
to
have
this
resolved
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
because
it
is
the
highest
court
of
the
land."
thank
you,
your
honors.
