justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ely,
do
you
regard
this
interpretation
of
the
secretary
as
the
kind
of
interpretation
described
by
justice
jackson's
opinion
in
skidmore
v.
swift
company,
where
the
secretary
is
not
authorized
specifically
to
make
rules
but
is
the
one
charged
with
administering
the
statute
and
follows
an
administrative
practice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
there
is
the
general
rule
that
if
the
administrative
construction
is
totally
wrong,
the
government
is
not
estopped
in
the
way
an
ordinary
party
is
by
a
long
--
even
a
fairly
long
history
of
wrong
construction
if
the
courts
determine
that
it
was
just
flatly
wrong.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
in
effect
secretary
wilbur's
letter
is
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute
even
though
perhaps
not
the
only
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
difference,
general
mccree,
that
you
are
referring
to
is
basically
efficiency
and
certainty
of
delivery
of
the
water,
rather
than
the
creation
of
new
water
rights,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
district
holds
it
as
trustee
for
the
various
landowners,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
do
we
know
that
some
subsequent
secretary
won't
come
along
and
say,
just
as
secretary
udall
did,
that
this
thirty-year
construction
of
the
act
is
wrong
and
we're
now
going
to
change
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
you
cite
in
your
brief
justice
jackson's
opinion
for
the
court
in
skidmore
swift
&
company
about
administrative
construction,
at
page
140
of
323
u.s.
in
that
case.
the
court's
opinion
contains
the
statement,
"good
administration
of
the
act
and
good
judicial
administration
alike
require
that
the
standards
of
public
enforcement
and
those
for
determining
private
rights
shall
be
at
variance
only
where
justified
by
very
good
reasons."
don't
you
have
to
take
the
position
that
secretary
wilbur's
letter
was
almost
irrational
in
order
to
maintain
the
position
you
are
now
maintaining?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
hadn't
understood
that
to
be
their
precise
contention,
counsel.
i
had
understood
that
they
had
thought
that
secretary
wilbur's
construction
of
the
act
was
a
permissible
construction
if
not
the
only
one,
and
that
under
swift
&
company
and
cases
like
that,
after
they
had
gone
on
for
a
period
of
time
it
represented
a
very
significant
canon
of
statutory
construction,
rather
than
simply
a
straight
estoppel
argument.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
secretary
wilbur
wrote
an
opinion
letter
of
about
six
pages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
i
was
reading
a
different
--
in
one
appendix
or
the
other
it
comprises
several
pages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
be
that
as
it
may.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
first
have
to
determine
what
congressional
policy
was
here,
whether
the
acreage
limitation
was
intended
to
apply
to
the
imperial
valley.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
brunwasser,
but
you
have
an
express
administrative
construction
that
went
on
for
thirty
years.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
was
wrong,
but
it
has
to
be
absolutely
totally
wrong,
as
i
understand
the
law,
and
if
one
reads
solicitor
barry's
opinion
as
opposed
to
secretary
wilbur's
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
reference
to
the
various
land
division
opinions
one
construed
vested
rights
more
narrowly
than
the
other.
it
is
not
a
case
of
black
and
white
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
land
office
decision
in
the
wright
case
that
secretary
wilbur
relied
upon
which
solicitor
barry
simply
said
is
inapplicable
here?
do
you
think
that
is
totally
inapplicable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
are
here
deciding
whether
or
not
secretary
wilbur's
construction
was
a
plausible
or
reasonable
one.
he
relied
on
a
couple
of
land
office
decisions
which
talked
about
vested
rights
and
solicitor
barry
said
no,
he
probably
shouldn't
have
relied
on
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
part
of
the
question
we
are
answering
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
can
understand
that
as
a
perfectly
plausible
reason
if
you
are
arguing
a
case
to
say
no,
the
wright
opinion
doesn't
apply,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that
means
that
the
wright
opinion
simply
had
no
applicability
whatever
and
that
secretary
wilbur
was
just
almost
out
of
his
mind
in
citing
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
section
46
of
the
act?
