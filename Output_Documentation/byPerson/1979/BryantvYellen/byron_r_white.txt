justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
that
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
supplemental
decree
that
got
around
to
specifying
the
perfected
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ely,
to
whom
did
the
perfected
right
run?
that
is
relevant
to
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standing
does
state
law
have
under
the
reclamation
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
could
deliver
it
if
the
land
was
in
160
--
all
held
by
persons
owning
no
more
than
160
acres.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
that
approach
it
is
a
truism
to
say
that
the
landowner
could
sell
no
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
folcrum
by
which
that
letter
was
published
in
the
congressional
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
standing
we
would
just
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
would
leave
the
district
court's
judgment
standing
but
a
judgment
that
wouldn't
bind
anybody
but
--
it
would
bind
the
united
states,
but
would
it
bind
some
other
people
who
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
somebody
else
could
convince
the
court
that
he
had
standing
to
challenge
this
holding,
why,
i
suppose
the
judgment
wouldn't
bind
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
somebody
would
look
around
for
somebody
like
that
since
they
would
know
what
the
attitude
of
the
ninth
circuit
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ely,
do
you
concede
that
a
different
rule
prevail
in
the
other
valley?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
came
in
and
bought
some
water.
they
just
came
in
and
contracted
for
some
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
come
in
and
say
we
have
rights
to
water,
they
just
came
in
and
bought
some
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ely,
again
the
united
states
isn't
suggesting
that
the
water
--
if
the
irrigation
district
just
refused
to
deliver
water
to
anybody
who
owns
more
than
160
acres
but
then
sales
took
place,
the
irrigation
district
would
have
the
water
to
delivery
to
anybody
who
owns
160
acres?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
lake
mead
named
after
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
that
this
court
has
already
twice
heard
opinions
from
the
solicitor
general
about
this
matter,
hasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
solicitor
general
rankin
thought
it
was
clear,
didn't
he?
or
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
suppose
the
irrigation
district
had
title
to
all
the
land
at
the
time
that
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
was
passed,
at
the
time
of
the
adjudication
of
the
presently
perfected
rights,
suppose
all
the
land
was
in
one
ownership,
you
would
not
be
taking
the
same
position,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
the
land
is
in
a
variety
of
ownerships
and
that
the
perfected
right
was
adjudicated
to
the
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
which
one
it
is
because
you
would
take
the
same
position
even
if
it
was
all
in
one
ownership.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor,
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
agree
that
the
statute
could
be
construed,
could
reasonably
be
construed
a
or
reasonably
be
construed
b,
and
for
thirty
years
it
had
been
construed
a
but
the
government
now
preferred
to
construe
it
b,
what
would
your
position
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
all-american
canal
had
been
guilt
before
the
boulder
dam
project
was
even
thought
of
and
they
had
a
big
on
the
colorado
and
the
project
act
comes
along
and
they
are
going
to
preempt
the
headgate
and
so
the
imperial
valley
people
say
you
must
protect
as
in
this,
you
must
agree
to
deliver
and
they
say
we
will
they
write
in
the
project
act
that
we
will
satisfy
perfected
rights
and
when
the
dam
is
built
they
contract
to
deliver
to
imperial
valley
the
water
that
had
previously
been
taken
out
through
the
all-american
canal.
now,
would
you
still
be
making
this
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they
did
is
they
went
to
the
government
and
said
you
are
going
to
be
taking
our
water
and
the
government
says
no,
we're
not
going
to
take
your
water,
we're
going
to
give
it
back
to
you,
we
are
going
to
give
it
back
to
you
when
the
project
is
built,
you
are
going
to
be
taking
your
water
out
of
the
project.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
hypothetical,
a
plain
and
simple
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
all-american
canal
had
been
built
before
and
it
was
not
financed
by
the
project
at
all,
in
my
example
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
nevertheless
project
water
is
delivered
to
the
imperial
valley
through
the
all-american
canal.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
only
contract
that
was
made
is
the
contract
that
was
in
this
case
and
then
the
provisions
of
the
statutes
are
precisely
the
same.
i
would
suppose
you
would
be
here
making
the
same
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
now
how
about
my
question.
suppose
it
had
been
privately
financed,
would
you
be
here
making
this
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
provisions
of
the
contract,
provisions
of
the
statute,
provisions
of
the
reclamation
act
would
be
precisely
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
be
here
making
the
argument
if
the
all-american
canal
had
been
privately
financed,
even
though
the
contract
would
be
exactly
the
same
contract
as
present
here
and
the
acts
would
say
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
the
qualifications
of
your
clients
to
purchase
depend
at
all
on
the
price
at
which
the
land
was
offered?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
pay
whatever
price
is
asked?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
know
yet
what
the
price
will
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
motivate
a
seller
to
sell
at
less
than
market
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
they
want
to
wait
and
see
what
the
house
of
representatives
does
with
s.
14.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
sell
at
about
a
fourth
of
market
price
if
you
owned
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
roughly
in
your
judgment
is
the
spread
between
the
fair
market
value
of
the
land
with
water
and
the
price
at
which
it
will
be
sold
per
acre?
what
is
the
range?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
standing
depends
on
some
opinion
at
least
as
to
the
likelihood
of
making
purchase.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
light
does
that
shed
on
the
question,
my
first
question
as
to
likelihood
of
an
owner
selling
at
the
very
reduced
price
when
there
is
a
statute
or
a
bill
pending
in
congress
which
would
restore
the
full
value
of
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
already
passed
one
body
of
congress.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
these
improvements?
what
are
we
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
which,
i
suppose,
would
be
retained
on
the
160-acre
plots
that
they
could
retain.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
standing
argument
does
--
at
least
i
am
correct
to
extent
--
does
depend
on
an
assumption
that
the
owners
could
sell
at
the
reduced
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
maybe
just
one
might
be
enough
for
you.
