justice

stewart
what
was
the
occasion,
do
you
know,
for
the
reexamination
of
the
question
in
the
department
of
the
interior
in
1964?
justice
potter
stewart
on
one
occasion
he
did,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
mccree,
as
to
the
government's
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
section
46,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
it
is
your
view
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
did
not
have,
by
reason
of
this
statute
did
not
have
the
legal
authority
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
the
imperial
district,
the
contract
itself
should
not
have
been
entered
into
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
didn't.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
the
statute,
in
your
reading
of
it,
flatly
prohibit
the
contracts
that
he
made
that
says
no
water
shall
be
delivered,
and
so
forth?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
money
paid
pursuant
to
this
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
passes,
is
that
going
to
be
the
end
of
this
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
it
passed
tomorrow,
would
the
case
just
be
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
bill
in
the
house,
in
the
committee?
