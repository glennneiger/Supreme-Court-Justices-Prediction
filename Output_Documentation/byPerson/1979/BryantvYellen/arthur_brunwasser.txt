mr.
arthur
brunwasser
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
applicability
of
the
anti-monopoly
provisions
of
reclamation
law
to
the
imperial
valley
of
california.
the
outcome
will
determine
if
the
vast
benefits
of
the
reclamation
program
will
enure
forever
to
owners
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
acres
of
land
or
if
these
benefits
will
be
restricted
to
the
persons
who
live
and
farm
and
work
on
family
sized
farms
as
intended
by
congress
in
1902
when
the
reclamation
act
was
passed.
the
subsidy
involved
in
this
case
is
far
different
from
any
other
subsidy
which
probably
has
ever
come
before
this
court
and
which
has
been
considered
by
the
government.
aside
from
the
dollar
value
of
each
year's
supply
of
water
deliveries,
the
subsidy
here
is
continuous.
it
has
been
provided
for
the
past
forty
years
and
will
continue
to
be
provided
so
long
as
the
colorado
river
flows.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
mr.
chief
justice,
congress
intended
a
subsidy
and
a
windfall
and
congress
intended
that
that
subsidy
and
that
windfall
go
to
small
farmers
because
of
a
number
of
reasons
which
formed
part
of
the
fabric
of
legislation
intended
to
protect
small
family
farmers
as
developed
in
the
amicus
brief
that
has
been
filed
in
this
court.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
subsidies
per
se,
but
congress
intended
that
subsidy
be
used
for
a
specific
purpose
to
create
a
class
of
small
family
farmers,
not
large
farmers,
small
farmers.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
this,
there
are
proposed
regulations
to
cover
this
very
point
which
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
district's
brief,
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
proposed
that
there
be
a
limit
to
the
amount
of
acreage
which
may
be
leased.
there
is
a
limit
of
160
acres
that
may
be
leased.
in
addition,
the
land-owner,
as
i
understand
it,
may
own
160
acres.
the
problem
that
your
honor
has
put
his
finger
on
is
a
problem
that
has
plagued
the
reclamation
program
from
the
very
beginning.
your
honor
may
know
that
at
this
very
moment
on
capitol
hill
there
is
a
bill,
s.
14,
which
was
approved
by
the
senate,
it
is
now
before
the
house,
and
one
of
the
biggest
battles
over
changing
the
reclamation
program
was
over
the
question
of
leasing,
how
much
lend
should
a
landowner
be
allowed
to
lease
without
violating
the
excess
land
laws.
the
answer
is
that
the
secretary
has
discretion
under
section
10
of
the
reclamation
act
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations
to
carry
out
the
policies
of
the
law.
clearly,
the
policy
of
the
law
as
enunciated
by
congress
and
as
approved
by
this
court
in
ivanhoe
is
that
there
be
small
family
farms
of
160
acres.
now,
if
the
situation
arises
where
there
is
an
effort
to
lease
more
than
160
acres
or
1,000
acres
or
more,
than
that
is
a
matter
under
present
law
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
adjudicate
at
the
first
instance.
if
he
acts
unreasonably
and
beyond
the
scope
of
his
authority,
that
matter
would
assumably
come
before
the
courts.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
number
one,
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it
is
to
delete
any
applicability
of
the
acreage
limitation
and
the
residency
requirement
of
reclamation
law
to
the
imperial
valley
of
california.
number
two,
it
is
to
enlarge
the
acreage
limitation
from
anywhere
--
i
think
the
lowest
figure
is
about
640
acres
to
1,280
acres.
third,
it
is
to
delete
the
residency
requirement
completely.
in
effect,
the
landowners
of
the
imperial
valley
have
asked
congress
to
do
what
their
counsel
has
been
asking
the
federal
courts
to
do
since
this
case
began
in
1967,
and
i
might
point
out
that
a
lot
of
the
documentation
and
statistics
which
has
been
presented
to
this
court
in
the
reply
brief
are
self-serving
statistics
presented
by
representatives
of
the
imperial
valley
to
the
senate
committee
last
year
and
the
year
before.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
it
did,
in
december
of
1979,
s.
14
passed
the
senate
--
i'm
sorry,
on
september
14,
1979,
it
passed
the
senate,
i
believe
in
fact
last
week
hearings
were
held
before
the
appropriate
subcommittee
of
the
house
interior
committee
on
that
very
legislation.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
that
is
the
end
of
the
ball
game,
your
honor.
in
fact
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
i
think
so.
the
bill
was
introduced
shortly
after
the
ninth
circuit
made
its
decision.
there
has
been
an
effort
made
to
change
the
law
because
of
this
and
a
number
of
other
cases
and
the
specific
exemption
has
been
carried
for
the
imperial
valley.
i
might
point
out
that
as
far
as
i
recall
that
is
the
only
geographical
area
that
has
a
specific
exemption.
the
areas,
their
qualifications
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
yes.
there
were
hearings
held
in
sacramento
a
few
months
ago
and
hearings
were
held
this
past
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
hearing
is
on
the
senate
bill,
s.
14.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
litigation
does
not
seek
to
take
away
any
of
this
subsidy
that
has
been
provided
to
the
landowners
of
the
imperial
valley
in
the
past.
no
one
is
seeking
to
recoup
the
water
or
its
value.
the
case
concerns
the
right
and
entitlement
to
future
water
deliveries
and
we
seek
to
have
a
determination
as
to
whom
the
water
is
to
be
delivered.
the
continuing
nature
of
the
subsidy
must
be
borne
in
mind
when
we
consider
the
arguments
on
administrative
practice
and
the
non-legal
issue
which
has
been
urged
by
the
landowners,
the
non-legal
issue
of
fairness.
well,
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
proper
legal
issue,
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
it
because,
as
my
worthy
opponent
points
out,
it
seems
to
be
the
core
of
this
very
case.
fairness
at
most
is
a
variation
of
the
quitable
estoppel
argument.
the
landowners
contend
that
they
rely
to
their
detriment
upon
the
ruling
by
secretary
wilbur.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
i
think
the
argument
is
two-fold.
i
think
it
covers
both
parts
of
your
honor's
hypothesis.
in
the
first
instance,
from
the
time
i
became
involved
in
this
litigation,
they
have
argued
the
reasonableness
of
secretary
wilbur,
there
has
been
evidence
offered
in
either
this
case
or
the
residency
case
--
and
i
forget
which
one
--
of
how
some
of
the
landowners
heard
secretary
wilbur
and
they
heard
congressman
swing
and
what
have
you,
and
they
were
promised
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
two
and
a
half
pages,
your
honor,
the
wilbur
opinion.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
if
i
may
correct
your
honor,
that
is
a
collection
of
documents
which
are
appended
to
the
opinion
of
former
solicitor
barry,
and
the
wilbur
letter
is
about
two
and
a
half
pages.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
but
the
short
answer
is,
number
one,
if
there
is
anything
unfair
or
inequitable
about
enforcing
congressional
policy
and
seeing
that
the
federal
water
subsidy
is
delivered
to
the
people
to
whom
it
was
intended
is,
as
this
court
indicated
in
gerlach
and
ivanhoe,
the
landowner
should
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
okay.
i
will
move
over
to
the
imperial
valley
situation
which
is
the
boulder
canyon
act,
and
the
argument
is
made
that
because
of
present
perfected
rights,
congress
intended
a
shorthand
reference
to
a
specific
exemption
from
the
acreage
limitation.
let
me
start
at
this
point
in
ivanhoe,
this
court
handed
down
and
decided
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
where
there
has
been
an
exemption
from
the
acreage
limitation,
congress
has
always
made
that
exception
explicitly.
this
is
set
out
at
pages
90
and
91
of
our
brief.
examples
of
an
express
exemption
are
far
different
than
the
hidden
esoteric
meanings
that
we
find
in
the
boulder
canyon
act
that
are
urged
by
the
petitioners.
in
one
statute,
it
says
the
excess
land
provisions
of
the
federal
reclamation
laws
shall
not
be
applicable.
that
is
clear
and
concise.
in
another
statute,
it
says
except
as
provided
in
section
3
of
this
act,
the
excess
land
provisions
of
the
federal
reclamation
laws
shall
not
apply.
in
yet
another
statute,
it
says
the
excess
land
provisions
of
the
federal
reclamation
laws
shall
not
be
applicable.
there
is
no
such
language
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
preparing
for
the
argument
today,
i
was
rereading
arizona
v.
california
and
we
come
to
the
only
specific
reference
that
i
have
found
as
to
the
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
section
14.
section
14,
as
your
honors
know,
is
the
section
which
incorporates
reclamation
law
by
reference,
standard
language
which
is
found
in
every
reclamation
statute.
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
dissent
--
this
is
at
373
u.s.,
page
623,
he
points
out
that
both
rep.
swing
and
senator
johnson
emphasized
that
this
provision,
section
14,
was
deliberately
incorporated
into
the
project
act.
now,
nobody
in
this
case
has
yet
come
up
with
a
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
section
14.
the
petitioners
have
not
pointed
out
any
meaning
to
section
14.
it
is
mere
surplusage.
they
claim
that
everything
is
otherwise
provided
because
there
is
a
specific
manner
of
contracting
in
section
4(b).
well,
obviously
we
are
dealing
with
a
multi-state
project
here,
the
largest
project
of
its
day,
but
there
is
nothing
in
section
4(b)
that
says
this
shall
be
an
exemption
from
the
excess
land
laws
of
the
reclamation
law.
so
section
14
has
no
meaning
at
all
according
to
the
petitioners.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
an
administrative
construction
which
was
wrong
and
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
i
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor.
i
am
not
the
only
person
who
has
asserted
that
the
wilbur
letter
was
dead
wrong,
absolutely
wrong
as
a
matter
of
black
letter
law.
the
ninth
circuit
was
charitable
when
it
referred
to
the
wilbur
letter
as
a
rather
simplistic
analysis.
there
has
never
been
one
legal
analysis
or
evaluation
of
the
wilbur
letter
from
the
time
it
was
prepared
for
the
secretary's
signature
which
has
uphold
[illegible
words]
one.
on
every
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
i
would
have
to
have
more
details,
mr.
justice
white.
in
the
first
place,
if
the
people
in
the
imperial
valley
were
taking
the
water
from
the
river
and
then
along
comes
the
government
and
blocks
off
their
rights,
then
the
landowner
--
and
nothing
more
--
the
landowners
would
have
a
claim
for
condemnation
and
a
taking
under
the
gerlach
case.
if
the
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
in
your
honor
trying
to
summarize
what
has
happened
in
this
case
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
if
the
government
says
that
and
the
government
allows
the
previously
delivered
appropriated
water
to
go
through
the
federally
financed
canal,
the
acreage
limitation
must
apply.
if
the
government
says
no,
it
won't
apply,
they
are
doing
what
secretary
wilbur
did.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
if
there
was
no
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
through
the
privately
financed
canal?
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
it
is
a
matter
of
contract
then.
i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
contract.
i
think
the
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
the
distinction,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
in
the
case
at
bar
it
is
a
federally
constructed
canal,
the
water
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
i
don't
think
i
would
if
it
was
a
privately
financed
irrigation
project.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
there
is
a
case
that
comes
close
to
the
hypothetical,
it
deals
with
the
san
louis
project
in
the
central
valley
of
california,
where
there
is
a
dam
and
a
reservoir
which
was
constructed
jointly
by
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
california
and
there
is
a
solicitor's
opinion
by
solicitor
barry
that
the
acreage
limitation
would
not
apply
to
the
service
area
served
by
the
state
financed
canal,
even
though
the
water
in
the
jointly
constructed
reservoir
comes
from
both
places.
so
that
comes
close
to
your
situation.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
of
course,
there
wouldn't
be
that
kind
of
contract
because
the
contract
is
not
only
to
deliver
water,
the
contract
is
to
construct
the
canal.
that
is
the
contract
provided
in
the
project
act.
it
isn't
simply
the
secretary
saying
i
will
deliver
x
acre-feet
of
water
to
this
water
district.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
i
am
not
going
to
be
able
to
respond
in
detail.
i
can
just
tell
you
that
that
was
gone
into
at
trial
with
mr.
weinberg's
testimony,
the
government
expert
witness
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
as
i
recall
those
cases
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
i
understand
these
cases,
the
two
lands
cases
discussed
in
the
wilbur
letter.
they
referred
to
situations
where
the
water
had
been
delivered
and
there
was
no
new
delivery
system
that
provided
the
water
to
ana
wright
and
the
other
people
who
asked
for
an
exemption.
in
the
imperial
valley,
there
was
a
new
delivery
system,
so
it
has
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
water
under
the
preexisting
situation
went
into
mexico
and
then
back
into
the
united
states,
and
there
was
no
canal
constructed
by
the
government.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
according
to
mr.
weinberg,
secretary
wilbur
--
not
to
use
that
phraseology,
but
he
was
wrong
because
the
practice
had
always
been
that
when
you
bring
in
a
federal
project
vested
rights
under
state
law
do
not
exempt
the
landowners
from
the
acreage
limitation.
that
was
the
rule
and
that
was
a
rule
agreed
to
--
which
was
set
out
in
one
of
mr.
dent's
memoranda
in
1927
and
a
solicitor's
opinion
in
1927,
and
it
turns
out
that
once
in
a
while
on
a
project
you
will
have
one
or
two
people
who
are
right
there
right
next
to
the
existing
stream
and
the
stream
isn't
changed,
but
the
government
will
take
water
out
of
the
stream
and
the
stream
is
then
appropriated
and
they
allow
these
people
to
use
the
water.
but
that
is
a
far
different
situation
than
the
imperial
valley,
where
everybody
was
using
the
water
and
they
went
to
congress,
the
water
program
was
not
satisfactory,
they
couldn't
continue
to
use
it,
they
had
periodic
droughts
and
floods
in
addition
to
the
revolutionary
conditions
in
mexico,
and
they
had
to
have
this
project.
any
claim
that
they
relied
upon
this
project
and
they
would
have
approved
it
is
really
absurd.
one
only
has
to
go
to
the
dam
site
or
to
boulder
city
and
look
at
the
movie
that
gives
a
history
of
the
background
of
this
project
to
see
the
devastation
that
existed
in
the
imperial
valley
before
this
project
was
built.
i
would
like
to
return
to
present
perfected
rights
for
one
moment.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
not
under
section
1.
section
1
specifically
says
they
are
not
going
to
charge
for
the
water
and
they
haven't
charged
for
the
water.
they
charged
for
the
construction
of
the
canal.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
no,
i
don't
agree
that
that
is
the
reason
because
under
gerlach
the
government
appropriated
preexisting
water,
vested
water
rights
under
state
law
and
there
was
a
valid
claim
presented
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
for
the
exemption.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
yes,
but
as
this
court
said
in
arizona
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
i
don't
believe
so
because
it
is
one
thing
to
deliver
water,
it
is
another
thing
to
charge
for
it
and
this
court
said
very
clearly
in
arizona
v.
california
that
nothing
in
the
compact
purports
to
control
any
distribution
of
water
within
a
state.
and
as
i
read
this
court's
opinion,
it
simply
concluded
that
the
present
perfected
rights
of
the
users
in
the
lower
basin
are
to
be
satisfied
out
of
the
storage
facilities
in
lake
mead.
in
other
words,
on
days
where
there
may
be
a
water
shortage,
the
people
in
the
upper
basin
can't
withdraw
sufficient
water
to
prevent
the
present
perfected
rights
from
accumulating
in
lake
mead,
behind
the
dam.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
or
in
the
compact
which
says
word
one
about
the
acreage
limitation.
i
would
like
to
move
to
one
issue
raised
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
the
question
of
standing.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
unique
statute,
section
46.
it
is
a
unique
statute
which
doesn't
apply
anywhere
else
in
the
law.
there
is
an
entire
body
of
case
law
in
the
ninth
circuit
dealing
with
attempts
to
litigate,
individual
attempts
to
litigate
reclamation
act
cases.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
yes,
your
honor.
there
has
been
some
allusion
to
these
cases
in
the
briefs,
of
turner
v.
king's
river
conservation
district,
bowker
v.
morton,
and
the
two
cases
at
bar.
significantly,
chief
judge
browning
was
on
three
of
those
panels.
he
was
on
all
panels
with
the
exception
of
bowker
v.
morton.
under
section
14
there
will
be
an
automatic
drop
in
the
price
of
land
because
one
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
benefit
from
the
federal
water
subsidy.
there
may
be
a
dispute
as
to
what
level
that
price
is
going
to
drop,
would
it
be
in
this
case
to
1942
when
the
district
ceased
using
water
from
the
alamo
canal,
or
today
when
there
is
no
longer
water
available
from
the
alamo
canal.
but
the
fact
remains
that
there
definitely
would
be
a
drop
in
price
and
it
would
be
to
below
market
levels.
the
secretary
has
proposed
a
series
of
regulations
which
are
set
out
verbatim
in
the
district's
appendix
to
their
major
brief,
which
show
how
the
secretary
intends
to
carry
out
and
to
enforce
the
acreage
limitation,
and
he
quite
clearly
states
that
we're
going
to
carry
out
the
congressional
purpose
of
creating
small
family
farms,
wide
distribution
of
the
benefits
and
the
rest
of
it.
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
an
opportunity
to
purchase
some
of
the
richest
farm
land
in
the
world
at
below
market
prices.
the
secretary
has
set
up
a
list
of
priorities
about
how
to
qualify
to
be
what
he
refers
to
as
a
non
excess
landowner.
you
have
to
live
there,
you
have
to
promise
to
farm,
you
have
to
attempt
to
farm.
my
clients
qualify.
instead
of
there
being
150
to
200
large
landowners
controlling
essentially
all
of
the
excess
land
in
the
imperial
valley,
with
an
average
holding
of
715
acres
of
irrigated
farms
in
california,
and
my
clients
for
the
past
forty
years
have
been
essentially
1,600
fruit
pickers,
because
instead
of
getting
the
water
to
engage
in
farming,
they
are
out
picking
the
crops.
now,
that
isn't
what
congress
intended.
we
will
get
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
because
they
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
no
--
well,
the
landowner
does
not
have
the
right
to
set
a
price.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
but
we
know
it
is
going
to
be
below
market
prices
and
we
could
use
our
common
sense
to
anticipate
that
that
is
going
to
be
pretty
cheap
for
this
kind
of
farm
land.
then
there
are
federal
programs
available
that
we
have
made
allusion
to
in
our
brief
for
borrowing
funds
if
necessary,
certainly
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
because
the
testimony
in
this
record
in
answer
to
questions
from
their
own
counsel,
the
landowner
said
that
there
is
no
use
for
that
land
except
farming,
there
is
under
two
inches
of
rain
a
year,
unless
they
wanted
to
raise
rattlesnakes
and
rabbits.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
that
may
be
but,
you
know,
life
is
full
of
imponderables
like
that.
this
court
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
if
i
owned
14,000
acres,
like
mr.
elmore,
the
typical
imperial
valley
farmer
that
has
been
referred
to
by
the
petitioners
and
i
had
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
improvements
in
my
land,
as
they
claim
they
have,
and
i
know
that
the
law
is
determined
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
tulare
provides
that
the
value
of
the
improvements
will
be
taken
into
consideration
in
setting
the
fair
and
reasonable
x
contract
price,
i
would
be
very
reluctant
to
sit
back
and
let
my
14,000
acres
return
to
desert.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
i
don't
know
because
we
entered
the
case
as
intervenors
and
we
didn't
enter
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
but
the
record
to
date
shows
that
the
value
of
land
without
the
water
is
$25
to
$50
an
acre.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
and
the
value
with
the
water
is
$1,200
to
$1,400
an
acre.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
number
one
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
number
one,
if
the
bill
passes
congress,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case,
but
i
don't
know
that
the
court
may
decide
the
case
based
upon
the
possibility
that
congress
may
change
the
law.
so
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
the
law
will
continue
as
it
is
in
determining
the
question
on
its
merits,
the
case
on
its
merits
as
well
as
the
procedural
questions.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
spread
is
between
$50
and
$1,200
with
respect
to
the
improvements,
i
don't
know,
and
the
landowners
and
the
district
did
not
offer
any
conflicting
affidavits
in
the
trial
court
to
show
what
the
value
of
the
improvements
would
have
been.
so
the
only
record
before
this
court
is
that
the
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
they
build
ditches,
they
line
the
ditches
to
keep
the
water
from
seeping
down
too
far.
i
think
the
irrigation
district
simply
brings
the
water
to
a
certain
place
and
the
landowner
has
to
take
the
water
somewhere
else.
there
is
machinery,
of
course.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
well,
if
you
want
to
engage
in
farming,
you
would,
although
there
are
ways
where
--
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
a
substantial
number
of
them
would.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
even
one
would
be
enough
and
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
that
we
make
the
tender
of
$25
to
$50
to
mr.
elmore,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
to
ask
him
to
refuse
our
offer
for
some
of
this
rich
farmland.
i
don't
think
we
should
have
to
do
a
useless
act.
mr.
arthur
brunwasser
thank
you.
