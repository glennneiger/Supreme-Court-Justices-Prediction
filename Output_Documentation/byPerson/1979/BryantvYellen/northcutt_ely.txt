mr.
northcutt
ely
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
a
map
has
been
distributed.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
primary
question
before
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
is
whether
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
this
court's
opinion
in
arizona
v.
california,
and
its
two
decrees
in
that
case
require
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
deliver
water
in
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights
in
excess
of
160
acres
per
owner.
if
time
permits,
i
would
refer
also
to
two
other
issues
in
the
case,
namely
the
finality
that
we
feel
attaches
to
the
conduct
of
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
other
judicial
approaches
to
this
matter
over
a
period
of
some
thirty-odd
years
and
finally
briefly
the
standing
of
the
respondents
here.
we
have
briefed
all
three
issues,
i
may
say.
the
area
involved
in
the
imperial
valley,
the
court
may
recall,
is
below
sea-level,
it
was
irrigated
starting
in
1901
by
a
canal
that
took
off
in
the
united
states
and
followed
an
ancient
river
channel
through
mexico,
the
alama
--it
is
shown
in
yellow
on
this
map
--
and
back
into
the
united
states.
this
was
done
without
federal
assistance.
it
continued,
the
area
continued
to
be
irrigated
in
that
fashion
for
some
forty
years.
the
area
under
irrigation
grew
gradually
from
about
100,000
to
the
precise
figure
of
424,145
acres
as
of
the
effective
date
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
which
was
june
25,
1929.
this
court's
decree
of
last
january
1979
so
determined.
it
adjudicated
that
the
present
perfected
rights,
that
is
rights
to
water
for
a
specific
area
of
land,
424,145
acres,
had
been
established
under
state
law
by
valid
appropriations
with
the
priority
of
1901
and
that
the
quantity
diverted
and
used
in
the
effective
date
of
the
project,
1929,
was
2,600,000
acre-feet.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
in
this
court's
decree
of
january
1979,
in
arizona
v.
california.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
it
determined
the
present
perfected
rights
of
some
17
defined
tracks
of
land
in
arizona
and
59
in
california.
of
the
area
in
the
imperial
irrigation
district,
it
is
stipulated
that
233,000
acres
are
in
holdings
in
excess
of
160
acres.
there
are
800
such
holdings
in
the
district.
this
came
about
because
prior
to
the
time
when
the
boulder
county
project
act
was
enacted,
the
economy
of
the
valley
had
established
that
pattern.
lands
had
originally
been
acquired
under
the
desert
land
act
in
tracts
of
320
acres,
not
160
acres,
and
over
the
years
have
been
consolidated
as
the
laws
of
california
and
indeed
the
united
states
permitted,
with
the
result
that
as
of
1929
and
now
the
economy
of
the
valley
is
reflected
in
holdings
larger
than
160
acres.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
the
1979
decree
decreed
these
rights
to
imperial
irrigation
district.
i
should
add
that
under
the
laws
of
california,
the
district
is
a
trustee
for
the
landowners
who
are
the
equitable
owners
of
the
water
rights.
the
district
cannot
sell
them,
it
cannot
mortgage
them
under
california
law.
it
is
a
trustee.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
bounder
canyon
project
act
--
this
court's
1964
decree,
i
should
say,
defined
present
perfected
rights
as
rights
acquired
under
state
law
and
perfected
by
the
application
of
a
specific
quantity
of
water
to
a
defined
area
of
land
by
the
effective
date
of
the
project
act.
the
court
in
its
definition
adopted
the
state
law
as
the
key
to
the
magnitude
and
priority
of
the
present
perfected
right.
the
problem
here
arises
from
primarily
section
6
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
read
in
connection
with
section
14.
section
6
directed
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
so
operate
hoover
dam
and
lake
mead
as
to
satisfy
three
functions
first
flood
control,
navigational
flood
control
second,
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
and
the
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights
pursuant
to
article
8
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
article
8
of
the
colorado
river
compact
declared
that
present
perfected
rights
are
unimpaired
by
this
compact.
it
did
not
define
the
term
but
the
legislative
history
makes
--
as
reported
to
congress
during
the
project
act
debates,
make
it
very
clear
that
the
present
perfected
rights
being
talked
about
are
the
very
ones
involved
here.
imperial
irrigation
district
representatives
appeared
before
mr.
hoover
and
the
commissioners
and
granted
protection
if
there
was
going
to
be
an
interstate
allocation
of
water.
article
8
refers
to
the
very
lands
involved
here.
the
rights
were
perfected
by
the
application
of
water
to
these
same
lands,
the
233,000
acres
of
excess
lands.
this
was
well
known
to
congress
and
during
the
course
of
the
debates
on
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
you
may
recall,
there
were
swing-johnson
bills,
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
the
land
limitations
of
the
reclamation
law
of
160
acres
per
owner
should
apply
to
these
lands,
and
the
decision
was
plainly
that
they
should
not.
there
were
no
less
than
five
efforts
made
in
the
two
houses
to
add
a
specific
section
to
the
project
act
which
would
have
extended
the
160-acre
limitation
to
these
lands,
and
each
of
these
failed.
a
house
committee
included
such
language
in
one
bill,
the
senate
when
it
passed
its
bill
omitted
it.
three
times
in
the
senate
senators
phipps,
hayden,
an
ashurst
offered
amendments
to
do
this.
each
of
these
was
abandoned
because
it
had
no
support.
the
law
as
enacted
does
not
contain
any
specific
acreage
limitation
on
the
present
perfected
rights.
it
does
contain
in
section
14
a
direction
that
this
act
shall
be
deemed
a
supplement
to
the
reclamation
law
which
will
govern
the
construction,
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
project,
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
act,
and
the
question
is
whether
this
cross-reference
to
the
reclamation
law
somehow
overrode
section
16's
mandate
to
satisfy
present
perfected
rights.
now
the
consequence
if
it
did
is
that
the
secretary
cannot
deliver
water
to
some
233,000
acres
that
this
court
has
adjudicated
to
be
within
the
424,000
adjoined
present
perfected
rights.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
the
equitable
owner
of
the
water
right
is
compelled
to
sell,
the
effect,
according
to
our
opponents'
brief
it
this
the
land
carries
with
it
no
present
perfected
right.
it
must
be
sold
at
desert
land
prices,
$25
to
$50
per
acre
and
it
will
revert
to
desert.
now,
you
may
or
may
not
agree
with
that
consequence
of
the
statute,
but
that
is
what
our
opponents
say
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
case.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
he
is
stripped
of
it
and
if
there
can
be
a
greater
impairment
than
reduction
of
the
water
right
to
zero,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
it.
it
is
alleged
and
the
argument
is
made
that
the
land
is
worth
$1,200
to
$1,400
per
acre
irrigated.
it
has
been
irrigated
for
fifty
years
now
or
more
but
would
have
to
be
stripped
of
its
water
right
if
sold
at
desert
land
prices.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
i
will
touch
on
that
no
doubt,
and
mr.
bender
will,
too.
would
you
like
for
me
to
turn
to
that?
mr.
northcutt
ely
judge
turrentine
in
the
district
court
decided
against
the
united
states.
this
was
an
action
brought
by
the
government
to
require
an
injunction
against
the
imperial
irrigation
district
to
require
it
to
cease
deliveries
of
water
in
excess
of
160
acres.
after
a
trial,
judge
turrentine
decided
against
the
united
states
in
a
well
considered
opinion
in
which
he
said
it
was
repugnant
to
the
mandate
that
water
be
delivered
in
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights
to
say
that
water
should
be
withheld
from
233,000
acres
enjoying
such
rights.
the
united
states
did
not
appeal.
solicitor
general
griswold
in
a
memorandum
for
his
files,
which
has
just
been
made
public,
just
been
made
available
to
us
last
february
20
by
publication
in
the
congressional
record
and
which
is
annexed
to
our
reply
brief
in
full,
gave
his
reasons
for
not
doing
so.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
was
placed
in
the
congressional
record
by
senator
nelson
and
i
don't
know
the
circumstances
under
which
he
came
in
possession
of
it.
in
any
event,
he
referred
(mr.
griswold)
to
the
fact
that
this
question
had
been
considered
and
decided
by
secretary
wilbur
of
the
department
of
the
interior
in
1933
and
he
had
decided
that
under
the
reclamation
law
the
standing
practice
of
the
law
dating
at
least
from
1910
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
the
excess
land
laws
were
not
intended
to
apply
here.
the
secretary
--
i
am
digressing
slightly
from
the
standing
issue
but
not
much,
mr.
chief
justice,
secretary
ickes
followed
him
and
came
to
the
same
conclusion.
there
was
pending
a
confirmation
proceeding
in
the
state
court,
as
required
by
the
federal
law,
43
u.s.c.
511,
and
as
requested
by
the
contract,
to
determine
the
validity
of
this
contract,
at
coming
to
trial
on
march
9,
secretary
wilbur
went
out
of
office
on
march
4.
in
february,
in
response
to
inquiries
from
the
district
as
to
whether
he
would
inform
the
court
of
what
his
decision
had
been,
he
wrote
a
letter
which
was
submitted
to
the
court
which
said
that
early
in
the
negotiations
it
had
been
--
the
determination
had
been
reached
that
i
just
described.
this
had
been
some
13
months
earlier
that
this
conclusion
had
been
reached.
mr.
griswold
refers
to
all
of
this
in
his
memorandum
and
to
the
fact
that
five
succeeding
secretaries
adhere
to
this
ruling
as
a
good
reason
why
it
is
not
in
the
interest
of
good
government
for
the
united
states
to
appeal.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
have
relied
on
the
norwegian
fertilizer
case
which
refers
to
the
responsibility
of
the
administrative
officer
who
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
putting
a
statute
in
motion
and
this
is
exactly
what
happened.
after
the
united
states
had
decided
not
to
appeal,
a
group
headed
by
a
dr.
yellen,
123
individuals,
acting
in
their
own
name
and
not
as
a
class
action,
moved
for
leave
to
intervene
to
appeal.
judge
turrentine
denied
that
motion.
it
was
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
the
appeal
was
entertained.
the
united
states
did
not
participate.
and
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
case
against
the
district,
against
the
landowners,
holding
that
the
present
perfected
rights
were
not
a
bar
to
the
application
of
the
160-acre
rule.
i
may
say
that
this
case
had
been
started
in
1967
after
this
court's
opinion
and
first
decree
in
arizona
v.
california
had
come
down.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
regard
this
as
conclusive
at
all.
it
was
relying
primarily
on
an
opinion
of
a
solicitor
named
frank
barry
issued
in
1964.
after
the
court's
opinion
and
decree
had
come
down,
and
it
never
mentions
either
one
of
them,
it
held
that
all
the
secretaries
before
secretary
udall
had
been
wrong
--
these
were
wilbur
originally,
followed
--
the
other
secretaries
didn't
undertake
to
determine
the
merits
but
simply
regarded
this
matter
as
settled
--
these
were
krug,
chapman,
seaton,
and
so
on,
and
now
we
know
from
solicitor
general
griswold's
memorandum
that
secretary
morton
also
agreed,
so
altogether
there
are
seven
secretaries
in
five
presidential
administrations
who
followed
this
rule
that
the
economy
existing
in
1929
was
not
meant
to
be
dismantled
and
destroyed
by
a
statute
that
directed
that
these
same
protected
rights
be
served
and
not
taken.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
northcutt
ely
they
said
that
they
couldn't
buy
at
$1,400
an
acre,
they
expected
to
be
able
to
buy
at
the
lower
price
that
the
secretary
would
set.
they
said
the
value
of
the
land
of
this
desert
is
$25
to
$50
an
acre
which
means
a
windfall
of
perhaps
$200,000
per
160-acre
tract
to
the
buyer.
i
must
say
that
he
can
resell
at
once
under
the
law.
there
is
no
limitation
on
him.
he
can
resell
at
full
market
price,
not
the
desert
land
price.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
former
owner?
mr.
northcutt
ely
he
would
be
limited
altogether
to
160
acres.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
he
could,
at
desert
land
prices.
there
is
no
assurance
at
all
that
dr.
yellen
would
be
the
lucky
buyer.
if
the
honey
pot
is
this
big
and
this
good,
i
suppose
there
would
be
hundreds
of
thousands
of
bidders
literally
from
all
over
the
country.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
we
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
irony
is
intensified
by
the
fact
that
the
very
same
group
have
brought
a
suit
in
district
court
to
enforce
the
residency
requirements
of
the
reclamation
law,
and
that
had
been
decided
in
their
favor
and
was
appealed
by
the
united
states
and
that
case
was
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
same
opinion
that
decided
this,
held
that
the
same
group
did
not
have
standing
to
enforce
a
residency
requirement
because
there
is
no
assurance
that
they
would
be
the
lucky
buyers,
but
turned
right
around
and
held
that
they
did
have
standing
in
this
matter.
now,
there
is
one
added
item
on
standing,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
statute
under
which
this
action
is
brought,
which
is
section
46
of
the
1926
omnibus
adjustment
act,
provides
that
the
secretary's
authority
to
fix
the
price
on
resale,
that
is
on
sale
of
the
excess
lands
by
the
original
owner,
shall
expire
when
half
of
the
debt
to
the
united
states
has
been
paid.
now,
that
happened
while
the
case
was
on
appeal.
the
imperial
irrigation
district
succeeded
in
repaying
more
than
one-half
of
the
original
debt
to
the
government.
so
if
the
yellen
group
ever
had
standing,
it
disappeared
when
the
secretary
lost
his
authority
to
fix
the
price
on
the
sale
of
the
excess
lands.
now,
this
was
brushed
aside
by
the
ninth
circuit
on
rehearing,
but
we
say
they
never
had
standing,
if
they
did
they
lost
it.
and
if
the
yellen
group
didn't
have
standing
to
file
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
against
the
united
states,
that
judgment
remains
res
judicata
against
the
united
states
in
the
district
court.
the
case
should
not
have
been
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
shouldn't
be
here.
it
hinges
entirely
on
whether
these
private
parties
had
competence
to
intervene,
to
overrule
the
decision
of
the
solicitor
general
that
this
case
in
the
public
interest
should
not
be
appealed.
if
this
is
possible
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
where
to
draw
the
line
as
to
the
right
of
power
of
an
individual
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
it
would
bind
the
united
states
but
i
think
it
would
be
very
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
suppose.
we
prefer
that
the
court
would
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
think
you
are
probably
right.
you
are
probably
right.
we
would
hope
that
the
court
will
decide
in
our
favor
on
the
merits.
if
it
does
not,
then
the
course
indicated
by
mr.
justice
white
is
the
alternative,
we
feel.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
mr.
justice
stevens.
it
is
conceded
by
the
government
that
the
secretary
cannot
compel
a
landowner
to
sell.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
the
assumption,
yes,
and
this
means
that
a
man
on
the
day
before
the
project
act
took
effect,
june
24,
1929,
who
had
a
480-acre
farm
would
wake
up
two
days
later
and
discover
that
he
had
water
rights
for
160
acres.
he
hasn't
had
a
water
right
at
all
for
320
acres
for
the
last
fifty
years.
now,
this
in
the
face
of
determinations
by
seven
successive
secretaries
is
to
the
contrary,
it
seems
in
extraordinary
result.
mr.
northcutt
ely
coachella,
yes,
sir.
coachella
had
never
had
any
perfected
rights,
it
had
never
diverted
water
from
the
colorado
river.
it
was
like
the
two
districts
in
idaho
who
had
no
rights
in
the
water
at
all
and
the
united
states
was
at
liberty
to
condition
its
sale
of
water
by
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
they
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
correct.
the
court's
opinion
in
arizona
v.
california
draws
a
bright
line
between
two
classes
of
water
rights.
present
perfected
rights
the
united
states
never
owned,
had
nothing
to
sell,
and
contracts
rights
acquired
by
contract
with
the
united
states,
and
these
the
court
held
could
be
allocated
by
the
secretary.
he
could
choose
the
taker,
he
could
make
an
interstate
allocation,
he
can
make
intrastate
allocation,
but
not
so
as
to
present
perfected
rights.
in
some
ten
references
to
the
present
perfected
rights
which
we
have
collected
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
the
court
said
the
secretary
is
fettered
with
respect
to
these,
that
they
are
one
of
the
most
important
limitations
in
the
act,
are
of
vast
importance
to
those
who
have
water
in
their
possession.
so
the
three
points
that
i
had
hoped
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
the
contention
is
that
if
the
landowners
decide
not
to
sell
for
$25
or
$50
an
acre
but
to
wait
for
a
better
day,
that
the
district
can
redistribute
that
water
to
others.
you
can't,
for
two
reasons,
one
the
legal
one
i
mentioned
--
it
is
only
a
trustee,
it
can't
redistribute
water
pertinent
to
the
land
--
and
second,
there
is
no
place
to
put
it.
all
of
the
irrigable
land
in
imperial
irrigation
district,
private
land
is
now
being
irrigated.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
