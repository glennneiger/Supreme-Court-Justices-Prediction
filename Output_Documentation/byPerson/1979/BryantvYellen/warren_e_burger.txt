hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
three
consolidated
cases,
bryant
v.
yellen,
california
v.
yellen,
and
imperial
irrigation
district
v.
yellen.
mr.
ely,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.

it
is
being
distributed
now,
mr.
ely.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ely,
are
you
going
to
address
the
question
of
standing
or
is
your
colleague?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
hellen
and
his
group
sought
to
intervene,
did
they
make
a
commitment
to
buy
or
tender
any
money
that
obligated
them
in
any
way
to
buy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
just
said
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
not
the
owner
confronted
with
that
situation
be
also
free
to
sell
to
anyone
of
his
own
choice
over
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
ones
who
had
more
than
the
160
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
could
he
sell
the
excess
to
anyone
he
wanted
but
not
to
yellen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
have
something
to
do
with
his
standing
to
intervene
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bender.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
suppose
a
man
now
had
640
acres
and
before
this
case
is
decided
he
sells
three
tracts
of
160
each
to
three
qualified
eligible
purchasers
that
leases
back
all
of
the
land
sold
and
continues
his
operation
as
before,
would
that
be
permissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
hypothetical
is
that
there
is
no
fraud,
he
sells
it
to
three
different
owners
each
of
whom
will
have
160
and
each
of
them
leases
back
to
him
on
a
legitimate
lease
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
hypothetical,
part
of
the
assumption
is
that
it
is
a
legitimate
transaction,
all
on
top
of
the
table,
he
could
lease
back,
the
one
person
could
lease
back
three
other
160-acre
tracts
from
his
vendee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
a
matter
for
the
secretary
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thirty
years
of
congressional
inaction
after
wilbur's
letter
is
quite
significant,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
exactly.
i
understand
you
don't.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brunwasser,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
something
in
the
nature
of
a
subsidy
lurking
in
the
windfall
that
was
referred
to
earlier
by
the
solicitor
general
and
others
for
the
purchasers
who
acquire
the
property
at
a
modest
price?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
disagree
then
with
at
least
the
solicitor
general's
tentative
response
to
my
hypothetical
that
one
individual,
a
bachelor,
no
wife,
no
children,
could
dispose
of
all
of
his
acreage
in
excess
of
160
and
lease
it
back.
we
wouldn't
be
a
very
small
farmer
any
more,
would
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
thrust
of
the
pending
legislation
that
you
referred
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
has
passed
the
senate,
did
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
