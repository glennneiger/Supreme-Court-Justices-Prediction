mr.
charles
w.
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
as
mr.
ely
has
made
clear,
is
what
congress
intended
in
1928
when
it
passed
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
there
is
somewhat
of
an
unreal
quality
about
that
question
because
we
know
that
its
answer
is
one
that
in
the
true
historical
sense
we
can't
define
today.
no
one
today
has
the
capacity
to
look
back
fifty
years
and
say
with
certitude
what
congress
intended
in
1928.
the
legislative
history
which
has
been
itemized
in
the
briefs
seems
to
indicate
almost
overwhelmingly
that
there
was
no
intention
to
impose
a
brief
limitation.
but
even
with
that
evidence
we
can't
be
certain
we
are
engaging
in
some
reasoned
conjecture
when
we
as
counsel
assert
what
is
clear
and
what
is
not
clear.
but
there
is
in
this
case
a
core
of
fact
that
we
don't
have
to
conjecture
about,
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
and
it
is
really
the
essence
of
this
case
and
it
is
the
human
experience
of
what
happened
after
1928,
beginning
with
secretary
wilbur's
ruling,
the
judicial
proceedings
in
hewes
and
the
lives
that
the
people
in
imperial
valley
built
on
that
foundation.
that
human
experience
is
the
essence
of
this
case,
not
a
bunch
of
postulating
about
what
congress
may
or
may
not
have
intended.
that
human
experience
is
what
should
be
controlling
in
this
case,
i
suggest,
not
syllogisms
about
statutory
syntax.
the
fundamental
practical
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
contemporaneous
construction
of
this
act
which
was
begun
in
1931
when
the
government
negotiated
the
contract
with
the
valley,
is
the
bedrock
upon
which
this
valley's
economy
and
legal
order
has
been
based
for
almost
fifty
years.
that
bedrock
started
when
the
contract
was
negotiated,
it
was
perpetuated
when
the
electors
of
the
district
approved
the
contract,
it
was
solidified
when
secretary
wilbur
ruled
that
acreage
limitation
did
not
apply,
it
was
farther
solidified
when
the
contract
was
placed
in
judicial
proceedings,
the
matter
was
put
in
issue,
and
it
was
adjudged
that
acreage
limitation
does
not
apply.
now,
those
events
aren't
conjectural.
those
are
the
bedrock
events
in
this
valley's
life.
and
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
situation
where
we
have
an
administrative
construction
that
you
can
overrule
prospectively
with
only
minimal
impact
on
people's
lives.
mr.
charles
w.
bender
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
premise
of
that
rule,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the
court
will
uphold
the
status
quo
unless
the
matter
is
free
from
doubt,
unless
there
can
be
no
reasoned
argument
in
support
of
the
status
quo.
mr.
charles
w.
bender
that
is
right,
and
it
is
permissible
because
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
because
of
what
transpired
in
congress
when
reclamation
commissioner
mead
said
acreage
limitation
would
not
apply,
because
of
what
happened
in
congress
when
congressman
swing
said
acreage
limitation
would
not
apply.
there
is
a
whole
host
of
grounds
upon
which
one
can
base
secretary
wilbur's
construction,
including
the
governmental
practice
which
was
embodied
in
regulations
at
that
time,
dating
back
to
1906,
respecting
vested
rights.
the
administrative
practice
in
this
case
has
given
rise
to
reliance
that
is
widespread
and
not
conjectural,
and
the
reliance
of
private
individuals
in
this
case
is
awesome
in
its
dimensions.
since
the
1930's
virtually
every
transfer
of
land
in
this
valley
has
assumed
the
validity
of
what
secretary
wilbur
said
and
what
the
hewes
court
said.
virtually
every
family
that
has
farms
in
the
valley
today
has
at
one
time
or
another
committed
the
bulk
of
its
resources
to
acquiring
farmland
at
market
prices,
reflecting
the
land's
assumed
entitlement
to
a
perpetual
supply
of
water.
farmers
have
made
enormous
investments
in
sub-surface
drainage
tile,
concrete-lined
ditches,
leveling
their
lands,
purchasing
equipment,
all
premised
on
what
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
fundamental
expectations
human
beings
can
have
in
an
agricultural
community,
the
assumed
security
of
the
water
rights
appurtenant
to
the
land.
and
you
have
literally
hundreds
of
human
arrangements
that
have
been
built
on
this
bedrock,
testamentary
trusts,
inter
vivos
trusts,
mortgage
financings,
estate
plannings,
all
of
which
would
be
unwound
if
today
we
denied
the
legitimacy
of
the
status
quo.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
one
example
to
give
you
a
feel
for
the
concrete
facts
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
situation
of
petitioner
charles
nilson.
he
appeared
at
the
trial
and
testified.
mr.
nilson
was
born
in
this
valley.
he
lived
on
a
130-acre
farm
his
father
homesteaded
in
1907.
when
he
graduated
from
high
school
in
the
valley,
he
went
into
the
service
in
world
war
ii.
he
came
out,
he
and
his
two
brothers
joined
in
partnership
to
begin
farming.
over
the
years
they
put
together
a
970-acre
tract
in
which
mr.
nilson
owns
a
one-third
interest
and
that
is
his
excess
acreage.
throughout
the
1940's
and
the
fifties
they
acquired
this
tract
in
little
bits
and
pieces.
it
was
land
which
during
the
depression
had
gone
out
of
production
because
it
was
salt
poisoned,
virtually
worthless.
they
acquired
it
as
best
they
could
afford
it
at
$10
and
$13
an
acreage
prices.
it
took
them
on
an
average
five
years
per
160
acres
to
bring
that
land
into
production.
they
had
to
deep
plow
it
to
a
depth
of
four
feet.
they
had
to
do
that
twice.
they
had
to
install
tile
drainage.
that
land
today
is
what
it
is
because
of
that
man's
life.
its
value
is
because
of
what
he
put
in
it,
not
because
of
governmental
beneficence,
and
that
illustrates
another
fact
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
those
who
would
like
to
acquire
mr.
nilson's
land
at
$25
an
acre
don't
really
have
any
fundamental
equities
in
support
of
the
opportunity
they
seek.
they
haven't
declamentally
relied
on
the
past.
they
haven't
declamentally
relied
on
an
expectation
that
the
past
will
be
rewritten.
they
haven't
relied
on
mr.
nilson.
they
just
want
an
opportunity.
so
what
is
really
at
stake
here
is
not
an
abstract
proposition
but
a
very
practical
realistic
thing
as
to
who
is
going
to
own
this
land,
who
is
going
to
farm
it,
those
that
have
reclaimed
it
and
farmed
it
or
someone
new.
mr.
charles
w.
bender
yes,
your
honor.
we
brought
before
the
court
nine
owners.
two
have
since
deceased.
the
seven
remaining
live
in
the
valley,
farm
in
the
valley,
have
lived
there
all
of
their
lives,
with
two
exceptions
of
gentlemen
who
came
to
the
valley
after
college
or
after
high
school
to
establish
their
careers
there.
mr.
charles
w.
bender
yes,
your
honor,
they
represent
a
class
and
there
are
approximately,
according
to
the
record,
a
stipulated
fact,
800
such
ownerships.
now,
the
800
ownerships
are,
of
course,
combined
into
a
smaller
number
of
farms,
as
in
mr.
nilson's
situation,
where
you
have
really
three
ownerships
which
he
and
his
brothers
each
own
one-third
interest
so
they
have
three
ownerships
but
they
run
their
farm
together
as
nilson
brothers
farm,
farming
their
land
and
their
father's
130
acres.
a
final
and
i
think
most
practical
consideration
in
this
case
is
the
contemporaneous
vantage
point
from
which
those
who
construed
the
act
originally
made
their
decisions.
we
can't
recreate
that
vantage
point
today.
we
cannot
duplicate
their
perspective
of
what
contemporary
policy
was
on
what
happened
in
the
swing-johnson
proceedings.
now,
these
people
weren't
ignorant
officials.
porter
dent,
who
wrote
secretary
wilbur's
ruling,
was
the
chief
counsel
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
a
career
government
attorney
who
had
been
chief
counsel
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
since
1924.
his
career
as
the
bureau's
chief
officer
spanned
the
last
four
years
of
the
debates
on
the
swing-johnson
bills.
he
was
the
foremost
legal
authority
in
his
day
on
reclamation
law.
he
directed
the
compilation
of
the
textbook
on
reclamation
law.
his
immediate
was
dr.
elwood
mead.
dr.
mead
was
one
of
the
founders
of
the
project.
he
served
on
the
all-american
canal
board
in
1919
which
first
recommended
this.
he
was
the
government's
principal
witness
in
the
swing-johnson
hearings
and
he
was
intimately
familiar
with
acreage
limitation
policy.
mr.
charles
w.
bender
yes,
your
honor.
he
served
on
the
fact-finders
board
in
1924
which
made
the
recommendations
on
acreage
limitation
policy
that
were
ultimately
embodied
in
section
46
of
the
1926
act.
he
was
the
government's
principal
witness
in
the
hearings
preceding
that
enactment.
if
anybody
knew
what
acreage
limitation
policy
was
it
was
dr.
elwood
mead.
and
clearly
if
dr.
elwood
mead
had
thought
that
non-application
of
acreage
limitation
was
an
affront
to
national
policy
or
reclamation
law
he
would
have
said
so
in
congress,
but
he
stood
in
congress
with
congressman
swing
and
said
this
act
will
not
apply
to
acreage
limitation.
and
clearly
if
he
thought
that
what
he
was
saying
was
an
affront
to
national
policy,
he
would
hardly
have
arranged
for
the
bureau's
counsel
to
assist
the
district
in
defending
against
the
allegations
made
in
the
hewes
proceeding
about
the
160-acre
limitation
question.
when
that
question
arose
in
litigation
in
1933,
dr.
mead
arranged
for
the
government
to
send
counsel
to
help
on
that
issue.
clearly
if
anyone
had
thought,
if
there
had
been
any
serious
thought
by
these
men
who
knew
what
acreage
limitation
policy
was,
that
the
wilbur
ruling
was
wrong,
these
events
couldn't
have
happened.
and
that
is
pure
plain
fact
which
we
can't
escape
from
today.
we
can
stand
here
today
as
latter
day
historians
and
speculate
about
what
administrative
practice
was
in
the
thirties
or
the
twenties
or
about
what
congress
intended,
but
mead
and
dent
didn't
have
to
speculate,
they
took
part
in
the
events
of
the
day.
they
knew
what
the
events
of
the
day
were,
and
their
interpretation
as
a
real
practical
matter
is
far
more
likely
to
reflect
the
reality
of
what
congress
intended
in
1928
than
any
hypothesis
constructed
by
counsel
today,
whether
it
is
counsel
for
petitioners
or
respondents.
now,
in
circumstances
like
these
where
there
is
every
practical
reason
to
respect
the
past,
we
come
to
the
pragmatic
test
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
referred
to.
it
is
a
test
which
this
court
has
always
applied.
it
says
that
every
reasonable
doubt
should
be
given
to
the
status
quo,
if
there
is
any
basis
and
reason
for
argument
in
support
of
the
status
quo
it
should
be
followed.
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
v.
midwest
oil,
that
is
a
wise
and
quieting
rule.
it
is
a
necessary
rule
if
government
is
to
remain
a
practical
affair
intended
for
practical
men,
and
i
would
submit
that
that
same
thought
was
what
solicitor
general
griswold
expressed
in
1971
when
he
made
his
decision
not
to
authorize
an
appeal
of
the
case.
as
he
said,
the
essence
of
this
case
is
essentially
a
question
of
good
administration
of
the
government.
mr.
charles
w.
bender
the
occasion
arose
in
1964
hearings,
in
april,
from
associate
solicitor
weinberg
and
the
secretary
were
before
congress,
a
senate
committee
on
irrigation,
considering
a
plan
which
called
for
use
of
1.3
million
acre-feet
of
colorado
river
water
in
arizona
and
the
bringing
of
water
from
the
northwest
into
california
to
replace
that,
and
senator
kuchel
asked
what
law
would
apply
to
that
new
water
brought
in
from
the
northwest.
solicitor
weinberg
said
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
senator
kuchel
said
would
the
acreage
limitation
apply,
and
mr.
weinberg
said
i
don't
know.
senator
anderson
said,
well,
clearly
it
wouldn't,
it
hasn't
applied
in
california.
mr.
weinberg
said,
well,
it
may
have
to
be
litigated,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
it.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
that
is
a
very
revealing
incident.
if
this
law
were
so
clear
that
it
couldn't
be
said
--
if
it
was
as
clear
as
solicitor
barry
contended,
if
there
were
no
reasonable
arguments
any
place
for
the
historic
construction,
i
can't
understand
why
mr.
weinberg
stood
before
congress
and
said
he
didn't
know
the
answer.
mr.
charles
w.
bender
yes,
you
heard
about
it
in
the
footnote
from
solicitor
general
rankin's
brief,
you've
heard
about
it
from
solicitor
general
griswold,
and
will
hear
about
it
from
solicitor
general
mccree.
it
is
a
matter
about
which
at
best
there
is
dispute,
doubt
and
debate.
it
isn't
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
all
that
is
clear
--
mr.
charles
w.
bender
i'm
not
sure
he
asserted
it,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
bender
one
occasion
is
all
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
i
might
be
wrong
though.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
remarks.
thank
you,
your
honors.
