mr.
ely,
one
other
question
on
standing.
did
the
government
complaint
ask
for
an
order
compelling
any
landowner
to
sell
his
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
have
to
assume
that
there
will
be
voluntary
sales
at
desert
land
prices
in
order
to
support
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
mr.
nilson
typical
of
the
owners?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
the
nine
typical
of
the
owners
who
would
be
benefited
if
you
prevail
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
water
i
take
it
that
you
say
the
land
already
had
before
the
project
is
precisely
the
adjudicated
protected
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
the
value
of
that
water
would
be
attributed
to
the
land
that
somebody
would
be
required
to
sell?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
also
says
that
the
landowner
is
entitled
to
the
water.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
could
sell
it,
he
gets
to
sell
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
water
follows
the
land
and
the
owner
gets
the
value
of
the
water.
he
gets
the
value
of
the
land
as
irrigated
land.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
a
presently
perfected
right
that
was
adjudicated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
amount
that
you
are
talking
about
is
the
presently
perfected
right,
that
was
adjudicated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
each
owner
is
entitled
to
be
paid
for
his
share
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
isn't
merely
the
wilbur
letter
but
it
is
the
fact
that
they
have
been
delivering
water
pursuant
to
an
understanding
of
the
statute
with
which
you
disagree
for
all
these
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
really
the
case
would
be
precisely
the
same
even
if
mr.
wilbur
had
never
written
the
letter,
because
you
would
still
have
the
position
taken
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
on
which
everybody
acted
because
of
their
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
when
was
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
from
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
government
wants
to
keep
the
money
that
was
paid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
is
so
clearly
drawn
that
thirty
years
of
error
should
be
corrected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sort
of
like
the
income
tax,
a
hundred
years
of
error.
(laughter)
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
for
observing
presently
perfected
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
have
been
inconsistent
with
that
to
charge
for
the
water?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
have
been
inconsistent
with
that
section
to
charge
for
the
water?
