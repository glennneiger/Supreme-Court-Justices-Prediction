justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
indian
claims
commission
act
of
our
--
that
is
the
language
dishonorable
dealing,
in
that
sort
of
thing,
the
type
of
language
that
would
apply
between
trustee
and
award
or
trustee
and
settee
or
whatever
--
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
have
been
a
private
bill,
wouldn't
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
if
--
mr.
lazarus
is
the
taking
issue
an
open
one
in
this
present
litigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
--
i
don't
mean
how
you
feel
about
it,
but
i
mean
whether
it's
barred
by
some
previous
decision
or
barred
by
the
jurisdictional
acts
of
congress
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
--
what
--
what
if
congress
had
simply
said
instead
of
trying
take
back
the
800
square
miles
consisting
of
a
black
hills,
“we
have
a
lot
of
demands
on
our
resources
and
our
army
can't
protect
you
sioux
tribes
but
we
concede
that
it's
your
property
and
you
fight
off
the
individual
white
citizens
that
come
in
looking
for
gold
as
best
you
can.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
the
construction
of
the
treaty
made
it
an
absolute
obligation
to
keep
the
whites
out
no
matter
what
the
demands
on
the
federal
treasury
or
no
matter
what
congress
would
have
appropriated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
--
let's
take
--
take
the
situation
of
say,
something
completely
divorced
from
indians
of
locals
--
local
county
or
city
government
and
if
it
were
to
devote
--
to
devote
90%
of
its
tax
dollars
to
increase
in
the
police
force,
it
could
prevent
any
burglaries?
it
--
instead,
as
any
number
of
demands
on
those
resources
and
so
it
only
appropriates
20%.
therefore,
there
are
burglaries
in
the
area
which
depreciate
the
value
of
the
property
and
put
pressure
on
people
to
sell
perhaps.
now,
does
that
amount
to
a
taking?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
sioux
never
wanted
it
to
mine,
did
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
were
--
those
were
cases
just
involving
whether
interest
should
be
paid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
this
involved
a
taking
to,
that
those
expressly
involved
the
question
of
whether
justice
white's
hypothesis
was
or
was
not
a
taking.
