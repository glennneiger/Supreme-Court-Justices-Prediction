justice

white
that
there
had
been
a
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
it's
their
--
that
i
suppose
that
is
--
well,
that
would
have
been
one
form
of
dealing
with
an
indian
tribe
unfairly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
your
second
--
your
second
day
in
court
on
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
second
--
first
day
though
on
the
taking
issue
was
sometime
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
i
take
if
--
if
when
congress
took
this
land
as
you
say
it
did
instead
of
promising
to
pay
--
instead
of
promising
to
--
to
provide
rations
and
subsistence,
it
had
established
a
trust
fund
of
x
million
dollars
that
--
and
said
we
--
out
of
the
--
the
income
from
this
--
that
we
will
use
to
pay
rations.
wouldn't
the
case
be
different,
i
suppose
it
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
established
a
fund.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
their
promise
to
set
up
the
fund
and
use
that
to
buy
rations
and
distribute
them,
you
wouldn't
be
here,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
if
--
it
--
in
amount
it
might
be,
but
you
say
that
would
not
have
avoided
being
a
taking
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
taking
rather
than
a
--
rather
than
an
exercise
of
some
other
kind
of
congressional
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
--
and
that
that
would
be
the
same
--
it
would
be
the
same
thing
i
suppose
in
my
example,
that
congress
couldn't
do
that
to
a
white
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
have
be
--
and
it
would
have
been
a
taking?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
the
only
reason
it's
a
taking
for
an
indian
here
though
is
because
they
didn't
put
up
the
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
made
an
indefinite
promise
rather
than
put
up
the
fund,
so
it
was
a
taking?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
the
reason
why
it
would
have
been
taken
for
a
white
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
had
had
to
pay
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
had
to
pay
them.
it
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
be
enough
to
set
up
a
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
suppose
the
government
had
at
the
time
that
this
--
the
black
hills
were
taken
as
you
say,
the
--
the
government
had
said,
“well
let's
agree
on
a
value
and
we'll
pay
it
to
you
over
a
period
of
years”
and
they
had
agreed
on
a
value
say
$20
million
payable
over
50
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
have
been
a
taking?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
--
or
if
the
government
had
said
--
what
if
the
government
had
said,
“we
think
the
value
of
the
land
is
$20
million
and
we'll
pay
it
to
you
over
50
years?”
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
guys
--
they
got
--
sioux
didn't
agree?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
rule
in
fair
compensation
cases
where
the
--
where
the
government
is
saying
they're
not
--
is
--
is
arguing
this
is
not
a
taking
--
we're
taking
the
land
under
other
--
with
other
head
on
that
we're
paying
you
fair
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
that
the
united
states
had
set
up
a
trust
fund
of
$20
million
here
and
paid
the
income
of
it
to
the
sioux,
it
would've
been
all
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
not
--
it
would
have
been
a
taking?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
do
you
assume
that,
are
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
then
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
taking
even
though
the
sioux
had
not
agreed
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
united
states
have
said,
“well,
we
were
thinking
of
setting
up
a
$20
million
and
paying
the
interest
to
you
but
--
but
instead
of
doing
that,
we're
going
to
pay
you
a
what'll
undoubtedly
be
more
than
that
in
the
form
of
food
and
shelter.
that's
--
then
it's
a
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
though
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
didn't
--
i
think
you
said
that
if
--
that
if
the
government
set
up
a
fund
that
it
--
itself
determined
was
a
fair
compensation
and
paid
the
interest,
that
would
not
be
a
taking
as
long
a
some
--
as
long
as
whenever
the
question
came
up
it
was
determined
that
that
was
fair
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
--
although
the
sioux
might
at
the
time
have
objected
to
it
violently?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lazarus,
in
pursuant
to
a
treaty
a
reservation
is
set
up
for
an
indian
tribe
and
sometime
later
the
government
--
the
congress
just
says,
“well,
we
think
the
reservation
is
too
big.
we're
just
going
to
cut
it
in
half
and
open
the
rest
of
10
soldiers
and
just
--
cuts
in
half
and
leave
--
redraws
the
reservation”
and
the
--
now
is
that
a
--
is
that
a
--
both
a
breach
you
the
treaty
--
is
that
a
breach
of
the
treaty
or
is
it
a
taking
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
case
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
treaty
--
a
treaty
created
property
right,
it
is
a
property
right
that
--
it's
taken
by
the
united
states,
they
got
to
pay
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
was
more
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
more
than
aboriginal
title,
even
--
even
if
originally
it
been
aboriginal
title
that
was
recognized
by
treaty
and
it
constituted
a
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
but
if
all
the
land
in
the
reservation
is
either
allotted
land
and
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
or
it
has
been
entered
and
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
fee
ownership
of
whites.
if
all
the
land
in
the
reservation
is
either
allotted
land
or
fee-owned
by
whites
terminating
the
reservation
created
is
--
is
not
a
taking?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
united
states
at
the
time
had
said
look
we
were
taking
the
black
hill,
“we're
going
to
pay
you
$100,000
a
year
for
as
long
as
we
want
to
but
we
wont
tell
you
for
how
long
and
they
had
paid
them
a
$100
million,
you
would
still
be
making
your
very
argument
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
--
you
--
you
say
that
if
the
government
took
--
takes
the
black
hills
and
says
our,
we
promise
to
pay
you
a
$100,000
a
year
forever
for
the
black
hills.
obviously,
you
--
you
say
there's
no
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
so
you
don't
--
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
that
necessary
--
unnecessary
precondition
is
that
at
the
time
the
property
is
taken,
that
a
total
value
be
set
and
paid
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would've
been
--
it
would've
been
a
taking
vis-à-vis
a
white.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
if
a
white
--
if
white
--
as
if
a
group
white
people
had
owned
the
white
hills
and
the
government
had
done
this
to
them,
that
would
have
been
a
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
really?
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
could
take
the
--
you
could
just
--
the
government
can
take
a
property
and
say
--
say,
“we
don't
need
to
pay
you
over
the
present
value
of
it.
we
can
just”
--
justice
byron
r.
white
pay
you
$100
a
year,
sooner
or
later
we'll
get
to
the
value?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
time
they
--
the
money
they
paid
out
equaled
the
principle
plus
the
interest
up
to
that
date.
