justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
claiborne,
perhaps
this
is
just
the
same
question
my
brother
stewart
has
asked,
but
what
is
the
source
of
the
government's
obligation
to
pay
$17.1
million?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
indian
--
indian
claims
commission
act,
i
mean
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
correct
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
say
that
the
--
the
source
of
the
obligation
is
a
finding
by
the
commission
pursuant
to
statute
that
there
was
dishonorable
dealing
by
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
one
question?
so
as
was
your
position
as
i
understand
it,
your
basic
position
does
not
require
us
to
consider
the
issue
that
the
court
of
claims
devoted
most
of
its
attention
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
claiborne.
there's
one
--
one
question,
i
guess
perhaps
we've
covered
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
going
back
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
very
first
line
of
inquiry
when
you
--
you
first
started
your
argument,
i'm
not
clear
in
my
own
mind
why,
if
there
is
the
good
faith
or
what
--
of
its
equivalent
that
on
which
your
position
ultimately
rests,
what
is
the
justification
for
this
$17
million
principal
award?
how
can
the
two
be
consistent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
is
it
not
correct
that
the
acceptance
of
your
position
requires
us
to
--
to
adopt
a
view
of
the
case
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
$17
million
principal
award
if
that
were
still
open.
