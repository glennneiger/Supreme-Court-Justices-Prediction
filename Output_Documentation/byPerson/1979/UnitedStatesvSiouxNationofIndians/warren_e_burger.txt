we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
the
sioux
nation
of
indians.
mr.
claiborne,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
--
this
proceeding
commences
the
--
the
court
of
claims
case
commences
with
the
1974
act
and
rests
on
that,
does
it
not?
that
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
did
either
of
them
--
did
either
--
could
either
of
those
acts
have
said,
"this
shall
be
treated
under
the
terms
of
the
fifth
amendment
taking?"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
congress
could
not
--
do
you
think
the
congress
could
not
have
declared
against
the
whole
background
that
this
was
a
taking
and
should
be
now
evaluated
on
the
basis
of
just
compensation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
tinkering
with
the
fifth
amendment
taking
clause,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
be
declaring
that
it
was
a
taking.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
because
if
the
indian
claims
commission
and
the
court
of
claims,
each
of
which
is
a
creature
of
the
congress,
couldn't
declare
this
was
a
taking,
why
couldn't
congress
have
resolved
that
question
in
the
1974
and
1978
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
--
is
that
important
that
they
did
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
--
and
in
the
--
in
that
process,
it
would
not
be
taking
as
of
a
contemporary
taking.
it
would
be
a
determination
of
whether
there
had
been
a
taking
back
in
1868
or
1977
or
approximately
hundred
years
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
it
amount
to
over
the
period
of
years
of
this
$50
million
figure
you
have
in
the
briefs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lazarus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
the
1974
or
1978
act
that
said
that
there
would
be
no
setoff
for
the
$50
odd
million
more
or
less
that
was
paid.
which
of
those
acts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
having
done
that
could
congress
also
declared
that
the
court
of
claims
should
proceed
as
though
there
had
been
a
fifth
amendment
taking
in
--
back
there
100
years
ago?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
a
couple
of
lines
in
that
statute
and
none
of
you
would
be
here
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
was
your
objection
to
having
the
act
declare
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
between
them,
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
now
--
what
if
the
--
the
invasion
had
been
simply
by
white
citizens
having
no
connection
with
the
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lazarus,
how
many
sioux
are
there
now,
to
this
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
claiborne,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
entirely
clear
on
this,
mr.
claiborne.
is
there
any
relationship
of
sovereign
to
sovereign
between
the
united
states
and
any
group
of
white
people
within
our
boundaries?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
--
and
the
united
states
is
not
and
never
has
been
a
trustee
for
any
category
of
white
people,
have
they
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
with
the
people
to
the
indian
relationship.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
such
power,
comparable
power
over
any
white
category.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
there
was
--
and
these
were
all
results
of
treaties
in
the
first
instance,
were
they
not,
these
rights
and
duties
and
powers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
constitution
itself
recognizes
indian
tribes
as
sovereigns,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
