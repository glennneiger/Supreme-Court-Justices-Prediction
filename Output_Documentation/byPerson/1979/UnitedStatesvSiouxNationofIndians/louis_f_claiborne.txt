mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
is
here
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
claims
which
court
directed
the
entry
of
an
award
of
more
than
some
$105
million
to
the
sioux
nation
in
respect
to
the
action
of
congress
a
century
ago,
to
be
exact
in
february
1877,
in
severing
some
7
million
acres,
the
black
hills
area
from
what
was
then
the
great
sioux
reservation.
some
$88
million
of
that
sum
of
$105
million
of
this
award
is
attributable
to
interest
calculated
at
5%
over
103
years
on
the
principle
sum
of
$17.1
million
which
was
found
by
the
commission,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
claims
to
have
been
the
value
of
the
7
million
acres
in
1877.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
exactly
so
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that
in
turn,
the
issue
of
interest
the
only
issue
we
bring
here
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
depends
entirely
on
whether
or
not
this
amounts
to
a
taking
in
the
fifth
amendment
sense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
$17.1
million
is
the
value
of
the
black
hills
area
as
found
by
the
indian
claims
commission,
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
claims
and
not
disputed
by
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
so.
it's
simply
that
that
was
the
value
of
the
land.
the
question
before
the
commission
--
left
open
by
the
commission
in
1974,
was
whether
there
had
been
in
effect
payment
to
that
extent
or
to
a
greater
extent
the
consideration
which
was
given,
an
undertaking
to
provide
provisions
for
so
long
as
the
sioux
nation
might
need
them.
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
from
--
from
this
principal
reason,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
are,
by
special
act
of
congress
passed
in
1974,
forbidden
to
offset
any
payments
made
with
respect
to
this
transaction
that
take
the
form
of
provisions
for
subsistence.
but
that
does
not
prevent
us
from
taking
into
account
that
payment
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
taking.
moreover,
the
court
of
claims
did
not
approach
the
question
of
taking
as
determined
by
whether
or
not
the
payment
was
or
was
not
sufficient
as
it
turned
out,
but
rather
on
whether
or
not
the
congress
in
1877
was
acting
in
good
faith
in
attempting
to
provide
a
fair
equivalent
for
the
value
of
the
black
hills
by
making
these
undertakings,
very
substantial
undertakings,
to
provide
provisions
which
as
we
say
ultimately
cost
the
united
states
amounts
in
excess
of
$40
million.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
$17.1
million
is
simply
the
evaluation
of
the
land
that
was
severed
from
the
reservation
in
1877.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
government
now
owes
it
only
because
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
special
act
of
congress
passed
in
1974,
the
government,
hence
forward
is
forbidden
to
consider
for
the
purposes
of
the
award,
an
offset
which
takes
the
form
of
a
provision
for
food
rations.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart
we
say
that
it
was
an
exercise
of
the
power
of
congress
to
deal
with
indian
affairs
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribes.
we
say
that
such
cases
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
act
of
congress
of
1877.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
just
as
it
was
in
lone
wolf
and
in
--
in
the
other
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
for
the
indian
claims
commission
act
which
provided
that
notwithstanding
that
congress
was
exercising
its
indian
power
if
it
turns
out
that
the
consideration
paid
was
inadequate,
all
that
some
duress
was
involved
in
the
case
of
an
agreement
as
a
matter
of
moral
claim,
the
court
shall
allow
whatever
the
deficiency
be.
what
is
more
as
i
have
said
before,
congress
in
1974
provided
with
special
reference
to
this
case
that
here,
exceptionally,
the
offset,
the
payment,
if
to
the
extent
largely
it
was,
paid
in
food
rations,
shall
simply
not
be
allowed
as
an
offset.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
are
left
unable
to
say
for
the
purposes
of
the
award,
we
pay
for
a
value
and
accordingly,
we
must
admit
our
liability
plus
the
dispute
evaluation
which
we
do
not.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
in
our
view,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
is
the
indian
claims
commission
act
and
the
1974
act,
18
--
1974
act
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
indian
claims
commission
act
provides
that
whenever
there
is
a
finding
that
the
united
states
in
its
dealings
with
the
tribe
paid
either
in
unconscionable
consideration
or
was
guilty
of
dealings
less
than
honorable
in
the
transaction
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
notwithstand
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
well,
it
so
happens
here,
mr.
justice
stevens
that
the
commission
made
no
such
findings
because
instead,
the
commission
found
that
there
had
been
a
taking
in
the
fifth
amendment
sense.
the
first
time
around
in
--
the
first
time,
the
--
the
most
recent,
but
the
last
time
the
court
of
claims
dealt
with
this
case,
it
said,
“no,
the
finding
of
a
constitutional
taking
is
barred
by
res
judicata,
but
we,
the
court,
will
substitute
a
finding
that
the
dealings
were
less
than
honorable
and
on
that
basis
we
will
make
an
award
without
interest
for
$17.1
million”
and
indeed
the
united
states
acquiesced
in
that
determination.
in
normal
course
judgment
would
have
been
entered
and
the
matter
would
have
ended
then.
however,
the
sioux
nation
once
again
persuaded
congress
to
make
an
exceptional
rule
and
in
1978,
the
congress
passed
an
act
which
directed
the
court
of
claims
to
ignore
the
objection
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
and
to
review
on
the
merits,
the
earlier
commission
determination
that
there
had
indeed
been
a
fifth
amendment
taking.
now,
on
this
third
round,
the
court
of
claims
acquiesced
and
affirmed
the
commission's
earlier
finding
of
the
constitution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
there
had
been
a
taking.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
indeed
the
only
cases
in
this
court
or
in
the
court
of
claims
before
this
one
in
which
this
--
that
court
has
found
a
taking
in
the
constitutional
sense
are
cases
in
which
this
court
has
found
it
appropriate
to
say
that
an
act
of
confiscation
is
not
an
act
guardianship.
all
cases
in
which
the
government
gave
no
undertaking,
made
no
payment
whatever
or
the
most
derisory
one
very
different
from
this
case
in
which
the
court
of
claims
assumed,
though
did
not
find
that
the
government
had
indeed
undertaking
--
undertaken
an
obligation
which
in
the
fullness
of
time
not
only
equaled
the
value
of
black
hills
but
perhaps
exceeded
it.
they
found
that
however
to
be
irrelevant.
irrelevant,
because
they
put
themselves
at
the
time
of
1877
and
said
in
effect,
“congress
didn't
know
it
was
going
to
cost
the
united
states
that
much.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
doubt,
there
is
some
thought
to
that
relationship
of
guardian
award,
in
the
terms
of
the
indian
claims
commission
act.
but
at
least
one
of
those
provisions,
the
one
that
deals
with
dishonorable
dealings
which
is
subsection
5
of
25
u.s.c.
70a,
expressly
allows
recovery
for
claims
that
would
not
be
recognized
at
law
or
inequity
but
which,
as
matter
of
morale
obligation
ought
to
be
paid
and
the
commission
is
directed
to
making
award
if
it
finds
that
it
as
a
morale
matter,
or
as
a
legal
matter,
the
dealings
were
less
than
honorable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
--
the
court
of
claims
decision
rests
on
the
1974
act
and
1978
act.
more
recently
the
1978
act
because
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
congress
could
have
of
course
simply
awarded
the
summation
of
$100
million
or
whatever
sum
in
the
discretion
of
congress
that
was
sought
to
be
fair.
i
don't
think
that
congress
could
direct
a
court
to
--
to
bend
the
rules
of
the
just
compensation
clause
and
hint
that
they
were
acquiescing
in
an
award
under
the
fifth
amendment
whether
the
congress
could've
found
a
violation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
that
may
have
been
possible.
i
have
difficulties
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
but
--
i
think
the
chief
justice
is
suggesting
that
the
court
still
had
a
role
to
play
and
whether
the
court
of
claims,
as
an
article
iii
court,
could
be
simply
required
to
make
evaluation,
determination
accepting
as
a
legal
matter
directed
by
congress
that
the
fifth
amendment
have
been
violated,
i'm
not
sure
whether
there'd
be
a
separation
of
powers
simply
because
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
perhaps
they
could
have.
clearly
they
did
not.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
important
that
they
purported
to
leave
it
entirely
to
the
court
to
determine
under
the
usual
rules
whether
or
not
this
amounted
to
a
taking
in
the
fifth
amendment
sense
and
any
side
hints
thrown
out,
well,
properly
disregarded.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
find
it
that
my
time
has
run
to
the
point
where
i
must
very
brief
about
the
background
facts
of
the
case.
the
difficultly
in
the
case
arises
because
in
1868
when
the
sioux
nation
severed
or
relinquished
the
large
part
of
its
territory,
it
was
provided
among
other
things
that
no
further
secession
should
be
accomplished,
should
be
valid
except
with
the
concurrence
of
three
fourths
of
the
adult
male
members.
that
treaty
in
1868
had
made
a
number
of
provisions
which
were
designed
to
make,
to
encourage,
furnish
incentives
by
way
of
money
and
--
and
material
aid
to
the
sioux
to
become
farmers.
however,
it
had
wholly
failed
in
that
respect
and
shortly
after
the
1868
treaty,
the
background
situation
against
which
this
transaction
must
be
judged
included
these
elements.
the
first
gold
reports
had
come,
that
the
black
hills
were
rich
in
gold.
those
reports
had
begun
as
early
as
1868
and
indeed
some
miners
had
intruded
that
early.
gradually,
the
invasion
multiplied.
there
were
concededly
serious
governmental
efforts
to
prevent
the
miners
from
intruding
and
indeed
to
remove
them
from
that
area.
those
efforts
continued
between
the
date
of
the
treaty
in
1868
and
the
end
of
1875.
they
were
however
largely
unsuccessful.
no
doubt,
the
greed
for
gold
exceeded
the
fear
of
the
soldiers
and
the
invasion
of
the
miners
became
in
effect,
unstoppable,
at
least
without
dedicating
the
entire
army
resources
to
that
single
purpose.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
reason
for
that
exchange
which
suggests
that
in
the
view
of
one
general,
the
president
might
wink
at
some
invasions.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
concededly
instances
in
which
the
army
did
arrest,
did
remove,
did
incarcerate
miners
who
had
penetrated
into
the
black
hills.
it's
a
matter
of
timing.
towards
the
end
of
19
--
of
1875,
the
president
had
determined
that
this
was
an
impossible
policy
and
he
eventually
abandoned
it
by
withdrawing
his
orders
to
the
troops,
though
he
did
not
publish
them
in
november
1875.
now,
another
aspect
of
the
background
of
the
case
is
the
conceded
dependence
of
the
sioux
on
governmental
food
rations.
as
i
have
said,
the
treaty
of
1868
which
it
sought
to
make
the
sioux
self-sufficient
farmers
had
entirely
failed.
the
sioux
in
1875
and
1876
and
1877
were
still
wholly
dependent
on
the
government
for
rations,
the
government
expending
something
over
a
million
dollars
a
year
for
that
purpose
alone.
the
sioux
treaty
of
1868
had
provided
that
rations
should
continue
for
four
years,
but
gratuitously,
without
any
legal
obligation,
the
congress
continued
those
appropriations
for
two
or
three
years
more
and
the
congress
was
unhappy
with
the
prospect
that
that
situation
might
continue
indefinitely.
after
all,
guardian,
though
it
was,
the
guardian
is
not
normally
expected
to
put
his
hand
in
his
own
pocket
for
the
sake
of
his
ward.
another
consideration
that
is
an
important
background
of
the
case
is
the
value
of
the
black
hills
to
the
sioux
themselves.
they
knew
there
was
gold
there,
but
they
had
no
intention
of
removing
it.
there
was
no
large
gain
in
the
reservation.
this
was
not
the
haunting
ground.
there
was
valuable
grazing
in
agricultural
land,
but
it
appears
that
it
had
been
put
at
this
period
to
very
little
use
by
the
sioux.
and
finally,
because
of
the
miners
coming
in,
there
had
been
clashes
between
the
miners
and
the
indians
and
there
was
a
prospect
that
that
conflict
between
those
two
forces
would
escalate.
in
these
circumstances,
congress
determined
at
a
much
patient
consideration,
that
the
only
practical,
the
only
realistic
solution
is
to
persuade
the
sioux
cede
the
hills
and
that
determination
in
the
mind
of
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
the
united
states
had
occurred
by
the
beginning
of
1875.
president
had
the
area
surveyed
with
the
view
determining
its
value
so
that
a
fair
equivalent
could
be
paid.
he
invited
the
sioux
leaders
to
washington.
he
appointed
a
commission.
that
commission,
the
allison
commission
failed
and
this
is
all
in
1875.
upon
the
failure
of
any
agreement,
congress
considered
the
matter
and
while
it
is
not
really
relevant
to
determine
precisely
what
threats
were
made
about
cutting
off
rations
since
this
is
not
a
case
based
on
duress,
it
is
nevertheless
important
to
note
that
congress
at
no
time
ever
cut
off
the
rations,
and
indeed
never
threatened
to
cut
off
the
rations
except
a
year
hence.
in
all
events,
a
new
commission
was
formed,
that
commission
ultimately
reached
an
agreement
with
the
sioux
leaders
albeit
the
requisite
number
of
members
did
not
sign.
that
agreement,
later
ratified
by
congress
in
the
1877
act,
provided
relevantly
in
section
5
that
in
consideration,
and
those
of
the
words
of
the
agreement
and
of
the
act,
in
consideration
of
the
cession
of
the
hills,
several
undertakings
were
made
by
the
united
states,
the
important
one
which
was
a
promise
to
provide
rations
for
so
long
as
the
sioux
might
need
them.
congress
was
well
aware
that
it
had
just
appropriated
in
the
preceding
years
over
a
million
dollars.
it
had
deleted
a
provision
that
rations
would
continue
for
only
ten
years
more.
this
was
entirely
open
ended.
congress
was
obviously
aware
that
it
was
undertaking
a
very
substantial
burden.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
a
figure
of
$57
million
which
is
based
on
general
accounting
office
reports
once
upon
a
time
conceded
by
a
former
counsel
for
the
sioux
which
we
tell
of
it
cannot
say
is
any
longer
conceded.
there
was
a
finding
by
the
court
of
claims
itself
in
1942
when
this
case
first
reached
that
court
that
as
of
1942,
the
total
amount
had
been
some
$43
million.
even
allowing
for
discount,
considering
that
the
payments
in
the
first
20
years
exceeded
or
averaged
something
over
$1
million
dollars
a
year,
it
is
evident
that
the
united
states
not
only
paid
the
interest
but
repaid
the
principal
long
before
1942
or
the
present.
there
is
one
irony
about
this
case
which
is
that
the
question
of
taking
would
not
be
here
at
all
if
either
the
1968
act
did
not
provide
that
the
signature
of
the
sioux
leaders
was
not
sufficient
in
this,
and
therefore
become
a
proper
treaty
or
if
they
--
three
quarters
of
the
members
had
been
persuaded
to
sign
because
no
matter
what
duress,
no
matter
how
unconscionable
were
considerations,
no
matter
how
dishonorable
the
dealings,
no
court
has
ever
found
the
taking
when
there
was
an
agreement.
compensation
may
be
due
because
advantage
was
taken
of
the
indians
and
they're
entitled
to
an
award
for
the
difference
but
not
for
the
interest.
had
congress
been
as
high-handed
and
as
callous
as
is
suggested
here,
that
result,
no
doubt,
could
have
been
accomplished.
after
all,
the
dependence
of
the
sioux
on
their
rations
might
have
informed
callous
executives
and
a
callous
congress
to
simply
wait
until
such
time
as
the
sioux
having
been
cut
off
which
they
were
was
so
desperate
that
they
would
indeed,
sign.
there
would
then
have
been
an
agreement.
indeed
an
irony
here
is
the
sioux
who
in
a
companion
case
involving
the
1868
treaty
have
recovered
subject
to
offsets,
something
over
$40
million
on
the
ground
that
they
were
grossly
underpaid,
that's
more
grossly
than
here,
will
not
proceed
interest
on
that
reward
--
on
that
award.

mr.

mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
accounting
reports
are
--
are
exhibits
before
the
court
but
those
figures
were
calculated
as
the
amount
attributable
to
the
subsistence
obligation
undertaken
in
1877
and
quite
independently,
of
the
obligations
which
continued
under
the
1868
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
know
that
the
procedure
with
respect
to
the
rations
was
to
bring
cattle
on
to
the
reservation
and
there
be
held
until
such
time
as
they
were
slaughtered
and
distributed
1.5
pounds
per
person
per
day.
beef
was
the,
in
gross
of
course,
was
the
requirement
of
the
treaty.
the
treaty
was
not
vague
with
respect
to
these
provisions.
it
specified
exactly,
a
pound
of
flour,
a
pound
and
a
half
of
beef
and
so
forth
per
day
per
person.
to
what
extent,
some
of
those
supplies
may
have
gone
astray,
i
cannot
testify.
now,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
claims
went
astray
in
two
respects
and
i
must
be
prompt.
first,
we
think
the
court
of
claims,
applying
its
own
good
faith
test,
presumed
the
wrong
way.
it
should
have
accorded
to
congress
the
presumption
of
good
faith
as
the
lone
wolf
case
teaches
us.
rebuttable
presumption,
if
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
at
the
contrary,
of
course.
but
instead,
the
court
of
claims
relied
on
the
failure
of
congress
expressly
to
say,
“we
all
hereby,
granting
a
fair
equivalent.”
they
did
say,
this
is
in
consideration
of
--
we
must
assume
they
meant
a
fair
consideration.
now,
secondly,
it
seemed
to
me
--
seem
to
us
that
the
court
of
claims
too
narrowly
focused
on
the
question
of
monetary
equivalents.
the
united
states
as
guardian
is
not
merely
a
land
manager.
it
has
broader
duties
and
in
the
special
exigent
circumstances
with
which
it
was
faced
here,
it
may
have
been
in
the
interest
of
the
sioux
to
acquire
even
for
less
than
full
value,
this
land
relatively
useless
to
them,
in
order
to
avoid
all
the
dangers,
including
the
danger
that
that
land
would
be
lost
to
the
miners
for
nothing,
including
the
danger
that
if
they
did
not
sell
it,
if
it
was
not
acquired,
they
would
be
without
rations,
including
the
danger
of
that
hostilities
between
them
and
the
miners,
would
endanger
the
future
of
the
sioux
nation.
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
have
thought
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
hesitated
to
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
a
congressional
finding
of
taking,
but
that
i
think
congress
is
entitled
to
say,
“you
may
--
you
may
have
another
opportunity
to
litigate
your
lawsuit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
it
ill
behoves
the
sioux
nation
who
have,
at
least
since
1920
have
been
very
much
the
special
favorites
of
the
laws,
to
put
themselves
in
the
shoes
of
a
white
claimant
who
would
not
be
here
having
been
barred
by
limitations,
res
judicata
or
estoppeled
by
the
admission
of
counsel
set
off
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
white
person
in
the
same
shoes
would
not
be
here
having
been
barred
by
limitations
by
res
judicata.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
sir,
but
most
important,
he
would
have
been
able
to
plead
payment
as
indeed
we
are
free
to
do
though
not
to
defeat
the
award
of
$17
million,
but
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
--
a
taking.
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case
was
very
clear
about
that.
they
held
that
although
the
gratu
--
the
provisions
supplied
were
not
allowable
as
an
offset
against
the
award,
they
were
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
there
was
fair
dealing
or
whether
congress
acted
in
good
faith.
now,
whether
congress
acted
in
good
faith
depends
on
whether
at
the
time
the
value
of
the
provisions
was
sought
to
be
somewhat
equivalent
to
the
value
of
the
black
hills.
the
value
of
the
black
hills
is
a
matter
which
a
century
later
gave
rise
to
enormous
controversy
where
the
commission
experts
varied
between
less
than
$5
million
to
more
than
$25
million.
the
commission
after
months
of
hearings
and
with
years
to
ponder
came
up
with
the
figure
of
$17.1
million,
but
congress
cannot
be
faulted
if
in
1877
it
did
not
accurately
know
that
value.
it
would
still
have
been
acting
in
good
faith
if
it
had
somewhat
undervalued
the
value
of
that
territory.
it
certainly
cannot
be
faulted
because
in
fact
its
promise
was
over
generous
and
as
to
that
promise
and
its
implementation,
my
learned
friend
has
suggested
that
the
figure
of
$43
million
is
confected.
it
comes
out
of
the
government
accounting
office
reports.
it
is
a
finding
of
the
court
of
claims
in
1942.
it
was
increased
by
an
admission
of
former
counsel
in
the
1950s.
it
is
not
a
figure
taken
out
of
the
air.
it
is
well-known
and
was
then
well-known
that
this
obligation
would
exceed
some
million
dollars
a
year.
congress
had
deleted
the
limitation
to
10
years
obviously
anticipating
that
it
might
need
to
be
continued
longer.
at
the
very
least,
congress
undertook
a
very
serious
substantial
obligation
which
was
fully
fulfilled
and
it
ought
not
now
to
be
said
to
be
to
have
been
acting
in
such
bad
faith
as
to
constitute
an
unconstitutional
taking.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
in
such
a
case
as
this.
to
delay
for
evaluation
would
have
simply
invited
the
hills
from
being
stolen
for
the
sioux
and
perhaps
later
required
when
the
government
had
gone
for
far
les
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
case
of
a
white
man,
that
perhaps
the
amount
must
be
qualified.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
in
light
of
the
actual
payment
that
was
made
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
in
subsequent
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
may
have
been
a
taking.
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
should
correct
myself,
mr.
justice
white.
in
a
case
of
a
white
person
in
which
the
obligations
are
different,
this
might
have
been
a
taking
but
there
would
have
been
no
recovery
because
the
payments
made
in
respect
of
that
taking
properly
discounted
would
have
eliminated
the
principle
and
therefore,
no
interest
would
have
been
precluded.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
as
by
my
computations,
that
had
occurred
at
about
1915,
certainly
by
1926.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
that
trustee
relationship,
mr.
chief
justice,
carries
both
obligations,
but
also
unusual
powers,
the
power
to
dispose
against
the
will
and
without
exercising
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
--
that
is
so.
that
is
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
this
court
has
held
that
independently
of
treaties,
the
inherent
situation
of
the
indians
place
them
within
the
protection
of
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
but
the
constitution
perhaps
also
recognizes
the
dependent
status
of
indian
tribes,
their
inability
to
alienate
their
land
which
accordingly,
if
it
must
be
done
in
their
interest,
may
occasionally
have
to
be
done
against
their
will
by
their
guardian.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
stevens
the
court
of
claims
has
not
taken
its
mandate
defined
a
recovery
only
when
the
dealings
were
less
than
dishonorable
literally.
they
have
found
that
in
every
circumstance
in
which
the
amount
paid
was
less
than
substantial
equivalent
even
though
in
good
faith
the
bargain
was
made,
there
will
be
an
award
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
claims
determined
on
its
own
without
benefit
of
any
finding
from
the
commission
that
the
dealings
had
been
less
than
honorable.
the
united
states
at
this
point
could
not
in
any
event
make
any
offsets.
accordingly,
perhaps
we
could
have
contested
that
finding
but
we
were
content
as
we
then
thought
to
pay
the
$17
million
and
have
done
with
this
protracted
litigation.
had
we
known
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
congress
would
reopen
the
matter
of
interest
in
1978,
perhaps
we
would
have
contested
the
finding
that
the
dealings
had
been
less
than
honorable,
but
it
was
not
seemingly
necessary
to
do
so
then.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
court
can
find
that
the
dealings
were
not
wholly
honorable
and
that
results
in
a
moral
claim
which
would
not
bare
interest
and
yet
find
because
that
is
judged
from
hindsight
and
yet
find
that
congress
was
in
good
faith
seeking
to
benefit
the
sioux
tribe
at
the
time
and
accordingly,
there
was
an
exercise
of
the
indian
power
and
not
of
the
eminent
domain
power
and
accordingly,
no
taking
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so,
indeed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
when
--
when
the
court
of
claims
made
its
decision
in
1974
saying
the
value
of
the
black
hills
is
$17.1
million,
it
then
said
in
stage
two
the
united
states
may
prove
its
offsets
including
these
provisions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
that
point,
the
sioux
realizing
that
the
offsets
wipe
out
the
award
came
to
congress
and
said
--
forbid
that
which
congress
did
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
that
--
that
produced
this
peculiar
situation
that
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
produced
the
$17
million
which
we
could
no
longer
contest.
