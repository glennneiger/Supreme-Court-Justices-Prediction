justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
there
is
no
issue
here
about
the
--
about
many
things.
the
only
issue
is
the
issue
of
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
depends
upon
whether
or
not
there
was
a
taking
of
condemnation.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
just
in
passing
then,
what
was
--
what
was
the
$17.1
million?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
doesn't
that
imply
that
there
was
a
taking?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
it's
been
decided
that
there
wasn't
payment
and
that
therefore,
the
government
owes
the
sioux
nation
$17.1
million
for
the
value
of
the
black
hills
that
were
--
of
the
black
hills
in
--
in
1877
or
whatever
the
date
was.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
don't
quarrel
with
that,
why
doesn't
that
imply
that
there
was
a
taking?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
--
so
what
was
the
$17.1
million
for?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
government
now
owes
the
sioux
nation
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i
understand
that
but
i
--
what
i
have
difficulty
understanding
is
if
it
wasn't
the
taking,
why
the
$17.1
million?
now,
i
can
understand
your
argument
if
you
can
say
it
was
taken
but
paid
for,
but
i
don't
understand
why
you
can
say
it's
--
wasn't
taken
at
all
if
you
don't
quarrel
with
the
$17
million.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
--
that
--
what
was
an
exercise?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
well,
then
they've
been
--
then
they
--
they
wouldn't
owe
the
indians
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
also
quite
clear
that
in
ordinary
takings
case
that
the
--
what
compensation
is
just
cannot
be
unilaterally
determined
by
the
taker.
and
in
my
brother
white's
questions
to
you,
you
would've
--
you
conceded
that
had
the
united
states
simply
unilaterally
determined
the
$20
million
is
the
--
is
the
right
price,
we'll
set
up
a
trust
fund
for
that,
that
that
would
not
have
been
a
taking.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
understood
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
lone
wolf.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
little
different
than
--
that's
a
little
different
in
this,
you
tell
me
if
i'm
mistaken,
from
--
from
an
indian
reservation
in
which
title
remains
in
the
united
states
government?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
such
as
in
the
decoteau
case
and
others
as
to
whether
or
not
the
reservation
has
been
terminated,
has
been
a
--
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
but
here,
this
was
not
indian
reservation,
this
was
--
this
belonged
to
the
sioux
nation,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
true
here
too?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
federal
land.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
title
was
in
the
sioux
nation,
not
in
the
federal
government?
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
been
any
question
of
compensation
in
the
cases
before
this
court
where
the
question
was,
“was
the
reservation
terminated?”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
unless
here
were
the
beneficiary
of
this
same
act
of
congress?
justice
potter
stewart
my
--
my
basic
concern
which
prompted
me
to
ask
you
a
question
or
those
questions
at
the
outset
was
that
i
had
difficulty
in
constructing
any
theory.
if
one
begins
with
a
proposition
that
the
united
states
own
--
owes
the
sioux
nation
$17
plus
million,
i'd
had
difficulty
constructing
any
theory
to
support
the
view
that
the
united
states
didn't
also
own
--
owe
interest
on
that
amount,
but
i
think
i
now
understand
your
answer
which
is
that
the
$17
million
resulted
from
the
action
of
congress
that
disallowed
any
offsets.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
that
is
inapplicable
to
the
question
of
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
did
in
1978.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
that
produced
this
$17
million.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
argument.
