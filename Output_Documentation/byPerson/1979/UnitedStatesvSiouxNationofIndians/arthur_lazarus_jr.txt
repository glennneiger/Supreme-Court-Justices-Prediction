mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
act
of
february
28,
1877,
effected
a
taking
of
the
sioux
black
hills
country
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
for
which
just
compensation
must
be
paid
under
the
constitution.
it
is
the
act
of
1877
that
affected
the
taking.
government
counsel
has
eluded
to
the
possibility
of
an
agreement
or
maybe
the
united
states
could've
gotten
an
agreement
or
it
could've
forced
an
agreement,
but
it
didn't.
it
enacted
the
1877
statute
and
it
is
the
statute,
not
any
agreement
that
took
the
sioux
land.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
was
the
1974
act
which
said
that
food
rations
and
provisions
may
not
be
deemed
payments
on
the
claim,
but
the
government
gives
less
to
the
1974
act
than
the
act
really
encompasses
because
the
indian
claims
commission
had
determined
that
whatever
the
government
spent
on
rations
was
a
payment
on
the
claim
and
therefore,
it
was
wiped
out
by
the
1974
statute.
congress
has
taken
that
whole
claimed
amount
of
money
out
of
this
case.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
congress
could
have
done
so,
your
honor,
but
when
i
testified
before
the
committee,
i
said
the
taking
was
so
clear
that
congress
did
not
have
to
go
that
far.
all
they
had
to
do
was
waive
res
judicata
and
the
sioux
were
going
to
win
this
case.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
--
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i
think
if
we
weren't
talking
about
$105
million,
none
of
us
would
be
here
today
either
because
this
is
a
clear
cut
case
of
a
taking.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
oh,
i'm
not
sure
i
could've
gotten
the
committee
to
go
that
far,
your
honor.
what
that
they
did
was
waive
res
judicata
and
give
us
our
day
in
court
and
we
told
then
if
we
got
our
day
in
court
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
first
day
in
court
was
on
food
rations
and
provisions
where
congress
made
a
different
kind
of
finding.
congress
said
that
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
in
1942,
the
case
was
litigated
under
a
special
jurisdictional
act
and
the
case
was
then
dismissed
and
the
basis
for
the
dismissal
was
a
matter
of
dispute
when
we
--
we
were
before
the
court
of
claims
in
1975.
we
said
it
was
dismissed
because
it
was
not
within
the
scope
of
the
jurisdictional
act,
the
majority
of
the
court
said
otherwise.
but
in
any
event,
even
that
majority
described
the
1942
decision
as
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
decided
it's
res
judicata.
they
had
their
doubts
even
then
about
the
correctness
of
the
1942
case
and
of
course,
congress
in
1978
has
told
us
that
1942
case
is
washed
clean,
we
consider
this
case
now
on
the
merits.if
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
oh,
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
if
congress
had
made
a
payment
in
1877
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
the
fund
could
be
the
equivalent
of
a
payment
if
it
had
because
that's
the
way
indian
money
was
treated.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
was
--
never
given
directly
to
the
indians,
it
was
put
in
the
treasury
to
their
credit.
and
if
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
if
congress
had
in
fact
set
up
that
fund,
i
would
not
be
here.
if
congress
had
made
an
indefinite
promise
to
say,
“we'll
give
you
$17.5
million
at
some
indeterminate
time
in
the
future
to
some
indeterminate
number
of
sioux
that
would
not
be
just
compensation.
just
compensation
is
payment.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
would
mean
the
1877
act
was
a
taking
and
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
1877.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
it
is
if
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
oh,
no.
the
taking
--
the
taking
issue
is
the
critical
issue.
that
is
the
one
the
1877
--
it
is
--
the
1978
statute
open
for
the
court.
that
is
the
only
issue
before
the
court,
but
when
you
say,
is
it
an
open
issue,
it
is
not
open
in
this
sense.
the
government
will
concede
that
under
the
circumstances
of
the
1877
act,
there
would
be
a
taking
if
that
property
were
owned
by
a
white
man
or
may
a
--
saying
is
it's
not
a
taking
because
it
was
owned
by
an
indian
tribe.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
congress
could
not
do
it
to
a
white
man.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
would
have
been
a
taking
and
it
is
a
taking
for
an
indian.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well
if
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes
if
--
if
it
had
been
a
taking,
if
--
if
that
property
were
owned
by
a
white
man
and
congress
took
it,
and
paid
them
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
they
would
have
to
pay
them.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well
that
would've
been
--
that
would've
been
allowable
self-help
except
under
the
1868
treaty,
the
sioux
had
promised
to
maintain
peace
and
the
sioux
did
maintain
peace
and
it
was
the
united
states
that
broke
the
peace.
it
was
the
united
states
that
sent
caster
on
the
reservation
to
publicize
that
there
was
gold.
as
soon
as
the
gold
was
publicized,
the
whites
invaded
the
reservation.
that
was
a
violation
of
article
ii
of
the
treaty.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
the
government
had
a
treaty
commitment
to
keep
them
out.
under
the
1868
treaty,
the
united
states
promised
to
keep
whites
out
of
the
great
sioux
reservation
and
it
had
a
military
obligation
to
do
so.
now,
it
turned
out
that
government
counsel
says,
“we
have
conceded
that
the
united
states
made
serious
efforts
to
keep
the
whites
out.”
we
have
conceded
no
such
thing
because
the
finding
of
the
indian
claims
commission
was
that
the
military
forces,
whether
because
of
inability
or
unwillingness
to
keep
the
whites
out,
allowed
them
in.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes,
until
the
united
states
changed
that
treaty,
that
was
its
obligation
and
i
would
point
out
to
you
your
honor
that
the
united
states
always
found
enough
troops
to
round
up
indians.
it's
only
trouble
was
finding
enough
troops
to
wind
--
round
up
white
people.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
your
--
your
honor,
let
--
let
us
assume
your
hypothetical.
first,
the
united
states
created
this
crisis.
it
wasn't
the
indians
who
created
it,
it
was
the
united
states
who
created.
the
united
states
took
the
bulk
of
the
sioux
land
under
the
1868
treaty
and
as
government
counsel
has
already
pointed
out,
paid
them
$40
million
less
than
the
land
was
worth.
as
a
result
of
that,
they
(inaudible)
impoverish.
that
was
the
fault
of
the
united
states.
then
the
united
states
kept
them
from
their
hunting
grounds
so
they
became
dependent
on
the
united
states
for
food.
then
the
united
states
first
encouraged
the
miners
to
come
in
and
then
withdrew
the
troops.
then
the
united
states
rounded
up
the
sioux
and
put
them
on
them
on
the
reservation
and
took
their
guns
and
horses
so
they
couldn't
hunt
and
there,
we
had
this
crisis
that
the
united
states
created.
now,
let
us
assume
the
united
states
didn't
have
enough
money
to
handle
that
crisis
other
than
to
take
the
black
hills
away
from
the
sioux
which
is
exactly
what
it
did.
all
we
say,
“it
is
okay,
pay
us”
and
that
is
what
the
united
states
did
not
do.
all
the
united
states
had
to
do
was
to
pay
us
the
$17.5
million
that
the
land
was
worth
and
it
made
absolutely
no
effort
to
do
so
and
it
hasn't
done
it
yet.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
put
your
finger
on
it
right
at
the
beginning
because
the
government
concedes
it
hasn't
paid
us
and
it
concedes
it
owes
us
under
some
theory,
under
the
indian
claims
commission
act.
that
can
either
be
for
a
breach
of
trust,
for
a
failure
to
pay
a
conscionable
consideration
or
through
a
violation
of
fair
and
honorable
dealings.
the
gravamen
of
each
one
of
those
causes
of
action
is,
you
didn't
pay
us
and
if
you
didn't
pay
us
for
those
causes
of
action,
you
didn't
pay
for
a
taking
either.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
their
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
would
have
been
an
agreement.
if
the
sioux
had
agreed
to
it
even
if
the
amount
of
money
was
not
fair
value,
that
would
not
have
been
a
taking,
that's
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
if
the
sioux
had
agreed
to
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
the
--
the
rule
in
just
compensation
cases
as
i
understand
it
was
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
this
court
has
already
disposed
of
that
argument
in
the
creek
nation
case
where
the
united
states
made
the
argument
that
we
were
not
dealing
with
them
in
our
sovereign
capacity,
we
were
dealing
with
them
as
a
trustee
and
this
court
made
a
very
short
swift
of
that
argument.
it
said,
“you
are
responsible
as
a
trustee
and
you
are
responsible
under
the
constitution,
and
your
activity
as
a
trustee
must
conform
the
constitutional
standards.”
and
the
court
there
found
even
though
the
government
argued
that
it
was
acting
as
a
trustee
that
it
was
a
taking
because
the
united
states
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well
it
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
would
not
have
been
a
taking
in
the
--
if
the
fund,
if
that
$20
million
fund
had
been
equal
to
the
value
of
the
land.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
worse,
that
i
have
thought
you
were
assuming
that
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
that's
the
exact
same
situation
as
if
the
united
states
had
paid
the
$20
million
directly
to
(inaudible)
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct
because
just
compensation
would
have
been
paid.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
but
in
this
case,
just
compensation
was
not
paid.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
then
it
is
a
taking
because
the
cases
are
quite
clear
that
a
--
that
just
compensation
is
payment,
not
promises.
the
government's
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
oh,
if
--
if
that
is
how
my
remark
is
being
interpreted
it
goes
too
far.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
oh,
no.
my
answer
is
that
if
that
$20
million
were
determined
by
a
court
to
be
just
compensation
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
--
as
the
commission
has
determined
that
that
$17.5
was
just
compensation,
then
just
compensation
would
be
paid.
but
if
the
value
of
that
property
were
$25
million
and
congress
said,
“we'll
set
up
a
trust
fund
of
$20
million,”
that
is
not
just
compensation
and
that
no
matter
how
much
good
faith
is
involved,
that
is
not
just
compensation.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
this
court
in
--
in
monongahela
--
in
monongahela
navigation,
90
years
ago
said,
“it's
not
up
to
congress
to
say
what
just
compensation
is,
the
court
say
what
just
compensation
is.”
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
now
i
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
you
honor,
there
are
60,000
or
more
sioux
now.
they
are
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
economic
ladder
even
compared
to
other
indians.
the
sioux
are
among
the
most
depressed
in
the
entire
united
states.
and
they
are
so
depressed
not
in
least
part
because
the
united
states
in
1877,
took
their
most
valuable
asset,
the
black
hills
and
it
hasn't
paid
for
it
yet.
now,
that
land
which
the
united
states
acquired
and
turned
over
it
to
its
assigns,
$1.4
billion
in
gold,
has
been
taken
out
of
the
home
state
mine
alone,
that's
just
one
mine
among
many.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
was
the
sioux
to
do
with
as
they
wished,
your
honor.
under
recognized
title
which
they
possessed,
they
had
a
title
as
sacred
as
a
fee.
they
could
use
it
or
not
use
it.
they
might
not
have
wanted
to
use
it
in
1877.
they
may
have
wanted
to
use
it
in
1910.
the
standard
value
is
not
the
value
to
the
indians,
it
is
fair
market
value.
and
if
they
wanted
to
use
their
property
for
hunting
at
that
time
and
for
gold
at
a
later
time,
that
was
to
be
their
choice,
not
the
government's
choice.
the
government
had
no
right
to
take
it
away
from
them
just
because
the
government
didn't
like
the
way
they
were
using
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
your
honor,
because
we
have
talked
a
great
deal
today
about
money.
so
i
would
like
to
address
the
$47
million
offer,
$43
million
or
$57
million
that
the
government
repeatedly
raises
in
its
--
in
its
presentation
both
in
its
brief
and
on
argument
here
today.
i
regret
to
say
that
what
government
counsel
has
told
you
about
that
money
is
just
plain
inaccurate.
he
has
not
accurately
described
what
is
before
the
court.
what
is
in
the
record
in
the
court
is
a
general
accounting
office
report
that
lumps
as,
mr.
justice
marshall
recognized,
that
lumps
a
whole
series
of
expenditures
under
a
label
“1877
act”
and
it
doesn't
tell
us
whether
it
was
for
provisions
and
it
doesn't
tell
us
whether
those
provisions
were
ever
delivered
and
it
doesn't
tell
us
if
those
provisions
were
delivered.
did
it
go
to
people
who
weren't
entitled
to
them
because
the
act
says
that
children
between
the
age
of
six
and
14
don't
get
rations
if
they're
not
in
school
and
it
didn't
--
doesn't
tell
you
whether
those
rations
were
delivered
to
people
living
on
lands
susceptible
of
cultivation
and
their
families
because
they
weren't
entitled
to
rations
either,
so
none
of
those
things
could
be
counted
in
the
$43
million.
the
$43
million
includes
money
that
was
spent
in
1875
and
1876.
there
couldn't
possibly
be
consideration
under
the
1977
act.
there
is
not,
and
our
brief
shows
a
bit
of
credible
evidence
that
the
government
spent
five
cents
for
rations
on
the
sioux,
but
even
if
it
had,
even
if
it
could
prove
that
it
spent
every
dime
of
that
$43
million,
it
would
be
irrelevant
for
purposes
of
this
case
because
whether
there
was
a
taking,
depends
upon
what
the
1877
act
said
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
may
have
happened
10,
20,
or
50
years
later.
the
1877
act
makes
no
payment
to
the
sioux.
all
it
does
is
make
them
a
conditional
promise,
“we'll
provide
rations
for
you
until
you
can
support
yourselves
subject
to
these
various
conditions
about
children
not
getting
and
--
then
labor
is
not
getting”
and
that
kind
of
indefinite
promise
is
not
just
compensation
and
the
government
concedes
that
is
not
just
compensation.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
is
a
breach
of
the
treaty
and
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
breach
the
treaty.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
--
that's
lone
wolf.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
lone
wolf
tells
us
that
congress
--
if
congress
determines
that
that
reservation
should
be
cut
into
half,
congress
can
come
in
and
do
it.
it
can
do
it
without
the
consent
of
the
indians
and
it
can
do
it
in
violation
of
the
treaty.
it
is
also
a
taking
and
when
congress
does
it,
it
has
to
pay
for
it.
there
is
no
reason
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that's
shoshone
case,
that's
klamath,
that's
creek
nation,
that's
every
case
this
court
has
had
where
we
have
dealt
with
just
compensation
and
recognized
title.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
that's
what
this
case
involves,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
those
--
those
cases
all
involved
taking.
those
--
the
--
the
circumstances
were
different.
in
the
shoshone
case,
the
shoshone
had
a
reservation,
the
united
states
settled
the
araphoes
on
part
of
the
reservation,
the
shoshone
never
agreed
to
it.
question,
“did
the
united
states
have
the
power
to
do
it?
yes.
did
the
united
states
have
to
pay
for
doing
it?
did
it
have
to
pay
just
compensation?
yes.”
that's
what
--.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that's
right,
a
treaty
protector.
we're
only
talking
about
recognized
treaty
title,
not
aboriginal
title,
but
recognized
treaty
title
is
fifth
amendment
property
under
the
constitution,
that's
what
this
court
held
in
shoshone.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
this
was
all
reservations.
the
--
the
beneficial
ownership
and
all
the
incidence
of
ownership
are
in
the
indian
tribe,
the
bare
legal
title
is
in
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
yes.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
--
that
is
correct.
it
was
recognized
by
a
treaty
twice
over.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
it
was
fed
--
it
was
a
federal
indian
reservation,
recognized
title
and
that
is
--
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
well,
all
of
the
incidence
of
ownership
i
--
if
--
if
you
want
to
say
who
has
all
the
incidence
of
ownership,
it
is
the
sioux
nation.
where
does
the
bare
legal
title
rest?
it
is
in
the
united
states
as
it
is
with
respect
to
all
indian
lands,
that's
part
of
what
establishes
the
trust,
but
when
the
united
states
takes
it
and
shoshone
made
this
quite
clear,
when
the
united
states
takes
it,
the
indians
have
a
100%
interest
for
purposes
of
determining
just
compensation.
you
evaluate
at
full
value.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
we
get
the
just
compensation
cases
in
that
situation
unless
you
have
a
--
a
statute,
what
we
call
the
surplus
land
statute
that
was
decoteau
and
--
and
rosebud
and
mattz
against
arnett.
where
there
is
a
surplus
land
statute
that
the
indians
have
agreed
to
that
terminates
part
of
the
reservation,
there's
no
just
compensation
claim.
there
may
be
a
just
compensation
claim
if
it
is
a
unilateral
surplus
land
statute
and
the
united
states
takes
these
surplus
lands
and
disposes
them
to
--
of
them
to
settlers,
to
white
settlers
for
$2.5
an
acre
when
there's
really
a
value
of
$10.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
that
is
correct.
just
--
just
changing
the
jurisdiction
is
not
a
taking.
it
is
acquiring
the
land
which
what
happened
in
this
case
that
creates
the
taking.
now,
your
honors,
i
see
my
time
is
almost
up
and
so
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
the
precedence
of
this
court
are
followed,
then
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
must
be
affirmed
because
the
precedence
of
this
court
say
that
the
sioux
had
recognized
to
a
treaty
title
that
that
tile
is
fifth
amendment
property.
that
the
united
states
acquired
the
land
under
circumstances
that
constitute
a
taking
and
my
client
has
never
been
paid
just
compensation.
and
i
suggest
to
you
your
honors
that
you
should
not
think
of
the
amount
of
money
involved.
the
constitution
is
not
only
color
blind,
it
is
dollar
blind
and
we
are
entitled
to
just
compensation
under
every
single
ruling
of
this
court
and
the
court
of
claims
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor
because
that
was
not
just
compensation.
mr.
arthur
lazarus,
jr.
your
honor,
our
basic
position
is
that
you
do
not
have
to
reach
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
claims
because
there
is
--
good
--
the
good
faith
test
in
our
opinion
is
not
a
valid
test.
if
you
apply
the
good
faith
--
faith
test
as
the
court
of
claims
did,
we
win
anyway
because
they
said
there
was
no
good
faith.
