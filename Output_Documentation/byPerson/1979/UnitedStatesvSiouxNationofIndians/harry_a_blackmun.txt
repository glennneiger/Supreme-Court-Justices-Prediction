certainly,
they
have
exchanged
in
letters
between
general
sheridan
and
general
sherman
were
profound
interest
as
to
how
serious
the
government
attempt
to
prevent
the

was.

mr.
claiborne,
could
i
ask
you
one
question.
focusing
on
the
1978
statute
where
the
congress
enacted
legislation,
as
i
read
it,
effectively
overruled
the
court
of
claims'
earlier
holding
that
the
taking
claim
on
the
part
of
the
sioux
is
barred
by
res
judicata.
does
that
bother
you
at
all?
you
don't
make
the
argument.
it's
--
it's
not
conceivably
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine?
