justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
--
was
the
924
conviction
vacated
in
simpson?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
here,
did
we
order
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
that
--
you
say
we
--
we
held
that
--
that
there
can
be
no
conviction
under
924
(c)
and
also
111?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
--
you
think
that
means
that
that
we
held
that
he
could
not
be
convicted
under
--
a
defendant
couldn't
be
convicted
under
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
say
simpson
held
that
there
--
that
the
government
could
not
have
convicted
under
924
(c)
alone?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
that's
what
you
think
the
--
simpson
held
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
if
you're
going
to
--
if
you're
going
to
attempt
to
get
enhancement
at
--
at
all
in
a
bank
robbery
case,
you
must
proceed
under
111?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
assault
case,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
--
you
may
--
you
--
you
have
no
choice
--
the
government
has
no
choice
to
proceed
under
924
alone?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
--
i
think
that
--
do
you
think
that's
essential
in
--
that
position
is
essential
to
--
for
you
to
win
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
--
i
suppose
the
government
really
couldn't
in
any
event
proceed
under
924
alone,
it
doesn't
describe
an
offense,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
so
that
--
if
the
government
--
if
the
government
--
with
respect
to
some
other
felony
that
isn't
covered
by
an
enhancement,
a
non-111
felony,
you
can
just
say
you
violated
924.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
--
then
you
have
to
go
to
some
other
felony
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
to
prove
a
felony
under
another
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
well,
it's
an
element
of
the
offense
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so
924
itself
doesn't
describe
a
separate
offense?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
underlying
--
there's
an
underlying
offense
that's
described
by
another
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
can't
even
be
under
simpson
arguably.
you
can't
even
be
convicted
under
924
(c)
if
it
--
where
the
underlying
felony
already
has
enhancement
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
mean
that
that's
924
in
all
of
its
sections,
none
of
these
sections
are
applicable?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean
in
924
(c)
would
--
and
that
reasoning
would
cover
both
(c)
(1)
and
(c)
(2).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
simpson
just
in
so
many
words
said
--
said
that
924
(c)
is
just
isn't
applicable
at
all
when
you're
dealing
with
an
underlying
felony
that
has
an
enhancement
provision
that
that
sort
of
language
would
be
very
relevant
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
--
maybe
but
that
--
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
at
least
reflect
that
eight
justices
then
opinion
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
its
reasoning
was?
how
did
it
arrive
with
its
result?
you
said
congress
didn't
intend
the
double
--
these
consecutive
punishments
because
they
understood
mr.
poff
in
certain
way
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
don't
agree
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
then
that
the
–
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
the
government
couldn't
proceed
under
924
(c)
alone
where
the
underlying
felony
already
has
an
enhancement
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
your
position
is
consistent
with
the
passage
quoted
by
the
court
in
simpson
or
the
statement
of
representative
poff?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
accord
in
simpson
said
that
wasn't
--
it
wouldn't
give
this
positive
weight
to
the
statement
that
mr.
poff
made
but
then
it
went
on
to
the
other
parts
of
legislative
history
and
held
or
at
least
it
was
the
court's
opinion
there
is
that
the
other
parts
of
legislative
history
supported
that
statement
of
mr.
poff.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
your
submission
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
could
say
maybe
that's
what
it
held
but
isn't
it
what
it
said
in
–
with
respect
to
mr.
poff's
statement
and
the
–
and
the
other
parts
of
legislative
history
that
supported
that
statement
that
my
brother
stewart
just
referred
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
was
just
telling
you
and
suggesting
to
you
that
the
court
found
other
evidence
in
legislative
history
that
supported
this
statement
of
mr.
poff.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
court
–
but
–
but
that
evidence
the
court
thought
maybe
erroneously.
the
court
thought
it
supported
the
statement
of
mr.
poff.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
happened
on
remand
in
the
simpson.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
government
take
the
position
there
that
it
could
choose
which
to
vacate
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
924
is
a
separate
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
charge
under
that
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
--
suppose
the
underlying
felony
has
no
enhancement
provision
and
you
want
to
proceed
under
924,
i
suppose
you
have
to,
don't,
you
in
order
to
impose
the
penalty
and
you
have
to
impose
the
penalty.
there's
no
--
the
statute
says
shall.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
you
have
a
non
enhanced
underlying
felony
you
must
proceed
under
924.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
have
to
have
the
enhanced
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
what
the
statute
says
--
the
statute
says
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
says
they
--
he
shall
be
punished.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
--
you
think
that
it
would
be
quite
proper
under
it
to
charge
both
924
and
that
the
underlying
felony
in
separate
counts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he
would
have
to
be
charged
under
924
and
even
they
have
the
924
(c)
enhancement?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
the
--
so
you're
saying
that
where
the
underlying
felony
has
an
enhancement
provision
and
you're
charged
in
the
924
you
would
–
you
would
add
the
924
enhancement
to
the
unenhanced
penalty.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
the
underlying
felony.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
you
have
to
sentence
under
924
(c).
justice
byron
r.
white
well
about
the
only
position
you
have
suggested
it
is
that
you
couldn't
sentence
under
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
government
says
you
can
convict
under
both
and
that
you
can
sentence
only
on
the
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
simpson
did
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
we
just
didn't
know.
