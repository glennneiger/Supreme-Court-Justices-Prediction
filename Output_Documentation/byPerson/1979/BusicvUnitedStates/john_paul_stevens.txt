justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goldman,
would
you
also
contend
that
if
you
--
if
larocca
had
not
used
the
gun,
but
had
merely
carried
it
and
therefore,
there
could
not
have
been
enhancement
under
111
that
he
could
--
there
could've
been
enhancement
under
924
(c)
(2)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
--
i
understand
but
your
--
you
said
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
i
want
to
understand
if
this
is
your
position
that
if
there
is
a
--
an
alleged
violation
of
a
statute
which
carries
an
enhancement
provision
as
111
does,
then
924
(c)
in
its
entirety
is
simply
inapplicable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
suppose
congress
would
deliberately
select
a
lesser
enhancement
for
a
--
a
felony
described
in
111
than
in
other
felonies?
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
if
you
take
his
statement
literally,
then
even
if
there
is
a
--
the
gun
being
used,
you
couldn't
even
use
924
(c)
(2),
i
mean,
a
gun
that's
being
carried
but
not
used?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
minimum
of
course
wouldn't
be
that
if
the
enhancement
provision
111
applies,
there
shall
be
no
other
enhancement.
that
would
be
the
real
minimum.
now,
you
say
that's
not
right,
i
know
but
that's
also
a
permissible
reading.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
saying
that
minimum
permissible
reading
of
what
congressman
poff
said
was
that
if
the
enhancement
provision
of
111
applies,
there
should
be
no
other
enhancement.
one
could
also
read
his
statement
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
goldman
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
shouldn't
our
disposition
have
been
to
vacate
the
sentence
under
924
(c)
instead
of
sending
it
back
and
letting
the
lower
courts
take
their
choice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
mandate
did
not
direct
that
the
924(c)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reich,
you
don't
contest
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
prove
the
aided
and
abetted
in
the
--
in
the
other
offense,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
before
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
must
assume
that
he
did
aide
and
abetter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reich,
supposing
larocca
had
not
used
his
firearms,
suppose
they're
both
just
carried,
in
your
judgment,
but
nevertheless
there
was
a
â€“
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
principle
part
of
111
was
violated,
would
you
say
that
busic
would
be
subject
to
enhancement
under
(c)
(2)
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
reason
for
enhancement
in
(c)
(2)
is
not
a
reason
for
enhancement
of
the
underlying
felony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
do
rely
on
the
fact
of
enhancement
by
reason
of
the
aiding
and
abetting
a
felony
where
a
gun
was
used?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
submit
that's
the
same
reading
as
the
one
i
suggested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it's
the
second
paragraph
that
defines
the
penalty
for
the
use
of
a
firearm
into
assaulting
an
officer.
if
you
recall
111
has
two
paragraphs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
is
the
second
paragraph
that
talks
about
the
use
of
a
fire
--
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
in
assaulting
an
officer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
you
haven't
over
simplified
it
because
the
world
shall
i
think
is
also
on
the
bank
robbery
statute,
2113
(d).
it
would
tell
you
can't
use
both
and
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
neither
shell
what
seems
to
me
would
take
precedents
over
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
you
just
had
to
choose
one
or
the
other,
is
what
it's
all
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
section
111
anyway
because
it
covers
thing
--
weapons
other
than
guns.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
its
just
like
--
that's
right.
they
claim
that
there's
the
alternatives
were
available
but
we've
held
it
wasn't
bad
older
or
the
other,
not
long
ago
that
you
can
have
alternative
provisions
of
the
same
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goldman
the
thing
when
you
look
through
the
whole
argument
before
the
statute
was
passed
congress
has
said
there
shall
be
specially
severe
penalties
for
carrying
a
gun
with
certain
limited
numbers
of
offences
and
you
construe
it
as
anyone
when
they
wanted
to
deter
the
use
of
guns
they
decided
to
get
have
the
penalty
for
those
offences
to
be
less
rather
than
greater.
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
make
much
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
where
it
is
true
doesn't
it
seem
to
fit
more
squarely
under
the
congressional
purpose
to
say
that
congress
intended
generally
speaking
to
make
more
severe
punishment
applicable
to
using
guns
and
you've
been
affected,
that
applies
everywhere
expect
where
they'd
already
taking
care
of
the
gun
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
that
the
thing
in
what
you
say
is
true
in
federal
cases
and
not
in
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right
and
that
would
be
--
might
or
could
be
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
in
federal
case
(voice
