mr.
samuel
j.
reich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
michael
busic
under
the
evidence.
while
the
assaults
were
taking
place,
mr.
busic
carried
a
gun
in
his
belt.
this
weapon
was
never
drawn,
never
pointed
or
fired.
by
his
conduct,
he
didn't
endanger
any
lives.
the
evidence
shows
that
while
most
of
these
incidents
were
taking
place,
mr.
busic
had
stopped
in
a
drugstore
to
buy
a
pack
of
cigarettes.
when
he
came
out
and
he
was
confronted
by
the
authorities,
he
surrendered
without
resistance.
as
to
the
assault
charges
of
and
these
actual
assaults
were
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
that
was
disputed,
your
honor.
he
certainly
surrendered
himself
and
the
evidence
is
clear
that
he
never
rendered
any
active
assistance
during
the
assaults.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
yes.
he
said,
“remember,
i
never
drew
my
weapon
or
never
fired
my
weapon.”
he
didn't
--
he
wasn't
familiar
with
the
pinkerton
doctrine,
but
that's
what
he
said.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
we
did
in
the
lower
court,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
that
is
not
before
you
when
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
yes,
yes.
as
to
the
assault
charges
that
busic
was
indicted
for
aiding
and
abetting
larocca's
use
of
the
firearm
which
larocca
was
using
during
the
assaults.
as
to
the
count
under
924
(c),
busic
was
charged
with
carrying
the
weapon
he
had
in
his
gun
belt
although
he
could
have
been
charge
under
the
indictment
with
using
larocca's
firearm
under
part
i
of
section
924
(c).
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
yes.
he
did
have
a
felony
record
and
he
was
convicted.
he
was
indicted
with
every
charge
conceivable
for
possession
of
every
weapon
in
sight.
under
the
924
(c)
count,
there
is
no
question
that
he
carried
a
gun
in
his
belt.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
it
was
carried
unlawfully.
that
is
also
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
under
section
924
(c),
one
can
violate
the
chapter
and
--
or
the
statute
in
one
of
two
ways,
alternatively
by
using
or
by
carrying
the
firearm
during
the
commission
of
the
underlying
federal
felony.
a
reading
of
the
statutes
indicates
that
the
unit
of
prosecution
is
the
underlying
federal
felony
and
not
the
number
of
weapons
involved.
and
as
we
see
it
this
becomes
very
critical
in
showing
the
similarity
between
busic's
case
and
that
is
his
codefendant,
larocca.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
no,
it
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case,
although
under
the
--
under
the
evidence
and
under
the
law
that
was
applicable
which
is
not
disputed
in
this
court
both
could
be
convicted
for
their
participation
in
the
assault
and
that
is
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
the
--
the
point
that
i'm
making
about
section
924
(c)
your
honor
is
that
the
possibilities
of
prosection
are
not
multiplied
because
of
the
number
of
weapons
involved.
one
is
liable
under
924
(c)
either
for
using
or
for
carrying
firearm
and
the
important
distinction
here
is
that
busic
could
have
been
convicted
either
for
using
vicariously
larocca's
firearm
or
carrying
his
own.
now,
what
the
third
circuit
has
said
in
this
case
is
that
larocca
who
is
the
one
spraying
the
parking
lot
with
the
bullets,
to
use
the
chief
justice's
observation,
can
be
sentenced
only
once
whereas
busic
who
watched
and
stood
by
and
is
only
responsible
vicariously
can
be
punished
twice.
as
we
read
the
simpson
case,
we
read
simpson
to
establish
that
a
simpson
or
a
larocca
type
defendant
can
be
convicted
and
punished
only
once,
and
that
is
for
the
underlying
federal
offense
when
that
offense
contained
its
own
enhancement
provision
and
it
our
position
that
busic
is
entitled
to
identical
treatment
as
larocca.
now,
the
government
assumes
in
its
brief
that
the
blockburger
issues
vanish
because
busic
was
charged
and
sentenced
for
carrying
his
own
weapon.
even
(c)
(2)
is
superimposed
on
an
underlying
or
the
underlying
assault
felonies
and
different
elements
are
not
required
as
to
each.
there
is
an
additional
element
for
the
924
(c)
(2)
violation
and
that
is
the
carrying
of
the
firearm.
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
under
section
111,
the
basic
charge
is
forcible,
assault
or
resistance
or
impeding
a
federal
officer.
there
is
an
enhanced
provision
if
one
uses
a
dangerous
or
deadly
weapon
or
such
as
a
firearm
in
doing
that,
but
the
underlying
charge
is
fully
included
in
the
924
(c)
violation
and
therefore
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
our
statutory
contentions
are
invalid
the
court
would
still
be
required
to
move
on
to
the
blockburger
issues
and
the
double
jeopardy
issues.
i
also
point
out
that
these
assault
incidents
involve
the
same
transactions.
the
unit
of
prosecution
as
i
understand
it
is
the
assaults
charged
in
the
indictments.
there
are
two
transactions,
the
924
(c)
seems
to
apply
to
both
of
them.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i
believe
so,
yes
sir.
i'm
using
at
that
way.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i
believe
that
this
is
–
this
was
based
on
my
analysis
of
the
–
of
the
cases,
although
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
no,
no.
the
cases,
the
most
recent
cases
in
this
court
talk
of
the
blockburger
test,
but
i
believe
that
even
in
simpson,
this
court
did
acknowledge
in
passing
that
we
were
talking
about
–
the
court
was
talking
about
the
one
transaction
which
was
the
bank
robbery.
if
busic
and
larocca
are
to
be
treated
differently,
obviously
this
will
result
in
creating
a
very
easy
way
to
evade
the
protections
which
simpson
sought
to
create
against
double
jeopardy.
we
point
out
that
using
always
includes
carrying
and
using
can
never
be
less
serious
misconduct
than
carrying
and
usually
it
involves
more
serious
misconduct.
simpson
itself
involved
two
or
more
weapons.
as
i
understand
the
facts
of
simpson
both
of
the
defendants
in
that
bank
brandished
their
firearms
and
possessed
their
firearms.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
924
(c)
involves
firearms,
but
firearms
is
broader
than
guns.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
that
is
true
and
as
this
court
noted
in
the
simpson
case,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
--
of
2113
in
that
case
and
we
believe
that
the
assault
case
was
to
deal
with
the
use
of
firearms,
handguns
and
the
like.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
it
would
include
any
--
any
deadly
weapon.
yes
--
yes
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
on
that
point
is
similar
to
the
bank
robbery
statute.
those
provisions
were
included
primarily
to
cover
handguns,
but
to
cover
anything
--
anything
else.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
some
cases
i
believe
it
hold
–
you're
going
to
have
a
violation
of
–
of
that
provision
using
a
shoe
and
possibly
a
fist,
but
primarily
it
is
directed
towards
the
gun.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
in
924
(c),
yes.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
yes.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
well,
whether
it
would
constitute
a
deadly
weapon
or
dangerous
weapon,
it
would
depend
on
who
–
who
the
person
is,
but
i
think
your
observation
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
yes.
if
there
is
to
be
disparity
treatment
as
to
busic
and
larocca
because
larocca
used
one
gun
and
busic
carried
another,
the
simpson
division
can
be
evaded
by
selective
theories
of
prosecution
even
in
this
case.
there
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
there
is
nothing
new
or
novel
except
when
the
theories
arise
under
the
same
statute
or
under
the
--
and
entirely
the
same
set
of
facts.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
well,
there
are
a
number
of
transactions
where
you
can
--
where
the
government
could
indict
the
person
for
tax
evasion
and
bribery
and
everything
that
seems
to
relate
without
controverting
any
constitutional
provision.
here,
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
government
has
the
choice
of
charging
simple
assault
and
either
charging
or
not
charging
the
enhanced
violation
by
using
the
dangerous
or
deadly
weapon.
they
can
charge
the
defendants
with
using
their
own
weapons
or
each
defendant
with
using
the
weapon
of
the
codefendant.
and
then
when
you
come
to
924
(c),
you
can
charge
a
defendant
with
use
either
of
his
own
weapon
or
his
codefendant's
weapon
were
carrying
one
or
the
other
weapon.
if
there
is
a
distinction
based
on
the
fact
that
one
defendant
uses
and
one
defendant
carries
a
firearm
or
a
distinction
based
on
the
number
of
firearms
involved,
simpson
itself
means
nothing
under
the
facts
of
the
--
of
the
simpson
case.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i
believe
that
simpson
held
that
you
cannot
have
multiple
sentences
where
the
two
types
of
statutes
are
involved,
but
i
also
believe
that
the
language
of
the
statute
--
of
the
simpson
case
establishes
the
underlying
reasoning
that
you
can't
have
consecutive
sentences
because
the
statute
924
(c)
is
inapplicable
to
a
felony
which
already
has
its
own
enhancement
provision.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
--
that
is
the
way
i
read
simpson,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
924
(c),
i
don't
address
myself
to
the
rest
of
the
statute
because
representative
poff
was
only
speaking
of
924
(c).
as
i
read
the
gun
control
act,
even
though
there
are
different
--
well
different
statues
were
put
in
there
because
of
different
considerations,
but
as
far
as
924
(c)
is
concerned
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i
believe
it
must.
now,
(c)
(1)
is
not
even
a
separate
sentence.
(c)
(1)
is
a
phrase
which
is
joined
by
an
or,
and
the
sentence
is
completed
in
(c)
(2)
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
conclude
that
when
representative
poff
made
that
statement
for
legislative
history,
he
was
stopping
in
mid-sentence
as
to
his
views
regarding
the
applicability
of
the
statute.
he
said
the
statute
is
not
applicable
where
the
underlying
felony
contains
its
own
enhancement
provision.
i'm
not
--
obviously,
i'm
not
quoting
of
that,
i'm
paraphrasing
it.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
in
the
lower
court
--
in
the
lower
court,
we
made
precisely
that
observation
to
the
--
to
the
court
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
my
answer
is
as
i
understand
the
opinion,
he
could
if
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
yes.
i
find
that
--
i
find
that
result
to
be
illogical
and
absurd,
but
under
924
(c)
we
were
making
the
point
in
the
lower
court
that
you
have
to
have
more
than
a
conspiracy
involved
and
if
someone's
carrying
a
firearm
during
a
tax
conspiracy,
an
income
tax
conspiracy,
the
logic
of
the
government's
position
in
the
lower
court
was
that
he
could
be
convicted
of
attacks
conspiracy
and
also
the
924
(c)
violation.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
that
is
the
argument
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
that
is
the
argument
that
i
would
–
i
would
make
if
it's
part
of
the
issue.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i
--
in
terms
of
the
use
of
the
statute
to
apply
to
conspiracies,
they
doesn't
--
the
legislative
history
seem
to
speak
very
broadly
in
terms
of
covering
all
kinds
of
federal
felonies
and
we
had
the
same
argument
come
up
if
the
person
is
involved
in
a
continuing
drug
conspiracy.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i
think
they
both
did.
i
think
representative
poff
did.
well
i
think
representative
poff
drew
the
line
is
that
he
did
not
want
to
have
broad
coverage
under
the
act
and
create
double
jeopardy
problems,
and
that's
the
way
i
read
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
think
representative
poff
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
he
did
not
want
to
have
double
enhancement
and
i
believe
that
that
--
that
is
clear
from
--
from
his
statement.
now,
the
--
the
question
that
has
come
up
that
i
feel
requires
a
response
is
exactly
what
kind
of
relief
are
we
asking
for
on
behalf
of
the
carrier
of
a
different
firearm.
the
ultimate
position
that
this
court
might
reach
and
i
think
properly
so
is
that
consistent
with
the
simpson
language
and
representative
poff's
statement,
no
carrier
can
be
convicted
where
there
is
an
--
an
underlying
felony
with
an
enhancement
provision,
but
that
is
not
necessary
to
give
busic
relief
in
this
case.
all
that
is
necessary
to
give
busic
relief
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
conclude
that
he
cannot
--
that
924
(c)
consistent
with
simpson
is
not
applicable
where
the
defendant
carried
a
firearm,
but
could
have
been
--
but
was
subject
to
enhancement
because
of
use
of
a
firearm,
not
necessarily
the
same
firearm.
i
go
back
to
the
language
of
924
(c)
which
is
alternative
and
not
base
on
the
--
on
the
number
of
firearms
involved
but
merely
the
existence
of
the
underlying
federal
felony.
the
crux
of
the
case
that
i
think
makes
busic's
case
identical
to
larocca's
case
is
that
busic
was
subject
to
sentence
enhancement
because
of
his
use
of
a
firearm.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i
would
say
he
would
not
be.
that
would
require
the
court
to
accept
the
ultimate
position
which
we're
arguing
that
924
(c)
has
no
application
whatever
where
the
underlying
felony
already
contains
an
enhancement
position
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
in
view
of
the
legislative
history
i
believe
that
there
is
a
gap
there,
but
i
hasten
to
point
out
that
in
this
case
as
to
busic
and
larocca,
it's
not
necessary
to
get
to
that
issue
since
busic
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
right.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
i'm
saying
that
he
cannot
--
the
prosecutor
cannot
use
924
(c)
at
all
where
the
underlying
felony
is
one
which
already
subjects
that
defendant
to
enhancement.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
yes
but
there
--
i
see
my
time
up
is
up.
there
is
a
difference
between
the
using
and
the
carrying
--
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
and
i'm
showing
the
relationships
between
the
two.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
the
difference
is
that
the
busic's
sentence
could
be
enhanced
because
he
used
larocca's
firearm
and
a
gun
--
and
the
statute
wouldn't
permit
multiple
punishments
if
there
were
10
guns
used.
mr.
samuel
j.
reich
thank
you,
your
honors.
