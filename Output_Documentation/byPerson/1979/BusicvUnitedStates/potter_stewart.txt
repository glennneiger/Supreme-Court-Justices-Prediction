justice
potter
stewart
you
have
to
prove
the
commission
of
that
felony
before
924
becomes
operative.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
some
sort
of
statement
to
that
effect
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
unlawfully.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
conversely,
i
--
i
suppose
both
in
924
(c)
with
respect
to
firearm
or
within
111
with
respect
to
the
aggravation
use
of
a
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon,
the
use
have
to
--
has
to
be
of
the
firearm
or
of
the
weapon
as
a
firearm
or
as
a
weapon
i
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
a
bank
robber
who
used
this
gun
to
bang
down
the
door
at
the
bank
wouldn't
be
using
--
probably
be
using
a
firearm
he
wouldn't
be
using
it
as
a
firearm.
justice
potter
stewart
conversely,
the
cases
you've
just
cited
where
a
person's
fist
if
used
as
a
weapon
is
a
weapon.
justice
potter
stewart
but
normally
isn't,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
luckily,
that's
one
of
the
few
questions
that's
not
involved
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
a
person
at
a
time
he
made
out
a
fraudulent
income
tax
return
unlawfully
had
a
gun
on
his
pocket,
he
could
--
could
he
or
could
he
not
in
your
submission
be
prosecuted
both
under
924
(c)
(2)
and
under
the
income
tax
evasion
of
criminal
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
both?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
he
didn't
want
to
have
double
enhancement.
justice
potter
stewart
assult.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
saying
that
the
prosecutor
must
charge
a
person
either
under
(c)
(1)
or
(c)
(2)
and
make
up
his
mind
and
if
you
charge
them
under
(c)
(1),
you
can't
be
charged
under
(c)
(2)?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
larocca's
basic
argument,
isn't
it?
isn't
that
larocca's
basic
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know,
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
and
i
think
your
time
is
up.
justice
potter
stewart
and
would
have
been
deciding
that
case
on
a
very
broad
ground.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
have
been
dicta
--
it
would
have
been
the
grounds
of
decision,
had
the
court
said
that?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
but
otherwise
wholly
uncontrolled
and
uninstructed
discretion
and
we
all
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
in
some
areas
prosecutors
just
have
such
tradition
in
the
prosecutor's
office
just
to
overcharge
in
every
case.
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
in
certain
types
of
cases
and
in
other
areas
it's
the
tradition
as
otherwise
and
it's
wholly
unreviewable
and
uncontrolled
of
that
discretion.
justice
potter
stewart
they're
not
instructed
i
mean
there
no
--
there
no
agreed
upon
criteria.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this,
perhaps
doesn't
that
we
should
be
invited
to
promote
or
encourage.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
–
it's
literal
language
did
say
that
924
(c)
was
simply
enactable
to
offences
under
those
--
under
those
statutes,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
my
substitute
is
not
intended
to
apply
to
title
xvii
section
so
on
or
the
--
other
two
other
sections
2113
and
2114,
2231
or
with
chapter
xxxxv.
substitute
is
simply
not
intended
to
apply
the
felonies
under
those
sections.
that's
what
he
said.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
maybe
he
was
speaking
carelessly
but
that
is
what
he
said.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
the
court
said.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
the
court
said.
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
read
mr.
poff's
statement
if
i
understand
your
argument
as
though
he
had
said
my
substitute
is
not
intended
to
apply
to
those
portions
of
sections
111
and
12
which
already
define
the
penalties
for
use
of
firearms,
a
portion
to
which
would
be
then
the
enhancement
portion?
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
invoked
and
the
sentence
is
imposed
under
them.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
why
you
read
it,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
here's
what
the
court
cited
in
--
wherein
simpson
said
the
subsequent
events
in
the
senate
and
conference
committee
pertaining
to
the
statute,
but
for
certain
exclusion
of
congress'
view
of
the
proper
scope
in
924
(c)
was
that
expressed
by
representative
poff.
justice
potter
stewart
how
mr.
levy
do
you
think
the
simpson
court
limits
a
sentencing
judge?
the
only
that
he
may
if
there's
an
armed
bank
robbery
that
he
may
sentence
the
convicted
defendant
either
under
the
enhancement
provision
of
the
bank
robbery
statute
or
the
924
(c)
and
he
has
to
choose
and
that
--
that
you
think
that's
the
stand
of
the
simpson
holding?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
the
–
you
think
it
doesn't
limit
the
prosecution
and
what
it
can
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
simply
imposes
that
limitation
upon
a
sentencing
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
think
that's
the
extent
of
the
holding
of
simpson
or
the
stand
of
the
limitation
that
imposes
upon
government
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
charges
of
enhancement
of
bank
robbery
or
use
of
firearm
whatever
that
is,
2113
(b)
i
think
it
is,
and
also
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
924
(c)
and
the
--
he's
convicted
of
both,
you
told
me
a
moment
ago
and
in
fact
i
invited
you
to
tell
me
that
you
thought
simpson
gave
the
judge
an
option
of
sentencing
either
on
the
enhancement
provision
or
under
924
(c)
but
in
light
of
the
language
that
my
brother
white
has
just
called
our
attention
to
i
suppose
the
judge
doesn't
have
an
option.
he
has
sentence
him
under
924
(c)
and
under
simpson
he
cannot
sentence
him
then
under
the
enhancement
provision
because
it
says
“shall”
because
of
that
word
shall.
isn't
that
–
wouldn't
that
follow?
justice
potter
stewart
shall
is
directory
language.
it
takes
a
way
any
discretion
of
the
judge
might
--
sentencing
judge
might
otherwise
have.
justice
potter
stewart
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
your
theory
of
the
case
that
you
had
amended
to
say
the
judge
has
no
discretion.
he
has
to
do
it
under
924
(c)
and
when
he
does
he
cannot
under
simpson
do
it
under
2113
(d),
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
in
a
hypothetical
case
he
was
charged
and
convicted
under
both.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
may
not,
under
simpson,
give
him
a
sentence
any
sentence
at
all
under
2113
(d),
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
shall
be
sentenced.
justice
potter
stewart
it
said
shall
be
sentenced,
that's
way
the
present
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can't
use
both.
justice
potter
stewart
that
maybe
the
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
in
both
places.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
–
that's
what
your
brother
suggested.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
at
a
minimum.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
educated
us
since
that.
