makes
no
difference
that
the
one
of
these
fellows
sprayed
the
parking
lot
with
the
machine
gun
and
the
other
one
didn't
hear

i
suppose.

nothing
new

it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

same
transaction
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
legislative
history
show
pretty
clearly
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
the
use
of
firearms
or
weapons
as
an
implement
of
the
particular
crime
and

a
false

question
how
many

you
think

what
he
was
saying

what
its
impact
was

what
the
whole
problem
was?
