mr.
gerald
goldman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
anthony
larocca
was
convicted
and
sentenced
consecutively
under
the
enhanced
penalty
provisions
of
two
federal
statutes
for
the
identical
use
of
a
firearm.
two
counts
alleged
that
he
had
assaulted
federal
officers
with
a
pistol
in
violation
of
section
111
of
title
xviii,
while
another
count
charged
that
he
used
the
same
pistol
to
commit
these
same
felonies
in
violation
of
section
924
(c)
(1).
petitioner
challenges
the
section
924
(c)
conviction
and
sentence.
in
punishing
assaults
on
federal
officers,
section
111
has
long
provided
an
augmented
penalty
if
a
firearm
is
used
to
accomplish
the
assault.
the
issue
presented
here
is
this.
when
congress
adopted
section
924
(c)
in
1968
to
provide
an
enhanced
penalty
generally
for
the
use
of
a
firearm
in
the
commission
of
a
federal
felony,
did
it
intend
to
duplicate
the
coverage
of
section
111?
frankly,
it's
surprising
that
it's
necessary
to
bring
this
issue
to
this
court.
indeed,
adopting
petitioner's
construction
of
the
statute,
the
justice
department
in
1971
advised
all
u.s.
attorneys
not
to
prosecute
defendants
under
section
924
(c)
where
one
of
the
pre-existing
enhanced
penalty
statutes
already
applied.
mr.
gerald
goldman
i
believe
the
department
was
acting
on
the
basis
of
the
very
principles
of
interpretation
that
guided
this
court
to
come
to
the
same
exact
conclusion
in
simpson
against
the
united
states,
in
particular,
the
rule
on
specificity
that
calls
for
a
more
specific
criminal
statute
to
govern
to
the
exclusion
of
a
more
general
statute.
and
in
addition,
in
the
following
year
1972,
in
a
letter
to
the
u.s.
attorney
for
baltimore,
the
department
again
reiterated
the
same
position
and
also
said,
“we
adopt
the
statement
of
representative
poff
as
government
policy.”
representative
poff's
statement
was
precisely
on
point.
he
said
his
--
his
proposal
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
the
preexisting
statutes
in
as
much
as
they
already
serve
to
deter
the
use
of
firearms.
now,
the
government
of
course
could
change
its
views
on
a
question
like
this,
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well,
mr.
justice
stevens
that
is
the
question
that
is
presented
in
the
companion
case,
mr.
busic's
case.
mr.
busic
was
charged
under
section
924
(c)
(2).
mr.
gerald
goldman
well,
our
position,
it
suffices
for
our
case
merely
to
call
attention
to
the
overlap
between
the
preexisting
statutes
in
section
924
(c)
(1).
our
position
is
that
simpson
and
the
tools
of
construction
relied
on
there
vitiate
a
conviction
under
924
(c)
(1)
quite
clearly.
there
is
then
a
separate
question
whether
simpson
and
the
principles
on
which
it
relies
also
vitiate
a
conviction
under
section
924
(c)
(2).
the
court
could
conclude
in
the
negative
with
respect
to
that
question
that
that
would
in
no
way
diminish
the
force
of
mr.
larocca's
petition.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well,
our
position
is
that
the
preexisting
enhanced
penalty
statutes
establish
an
array
of
punishments,
some
more
some
less
than
section
924
(c)
and
that
in
enacting
924
(c),
congress
chose
not
to
deal
with
how
to
reconcile
these
--
these
provisions.
congress
chose
rather
to
extend
coverage
to
felonies
that
were
not
already
subject
to
an
augmented
penalty
if
a
firearm
is
used.
that's
precisely
what
representative
poff
stated
and
furthermore
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes.
i
think
his
--
his
statement
is
subject
to
that
interpretation,
but
at
a
minimum,
he
must
have
meant
that
if
for
instance
section
111
applies,
then
his
proposal
was
not
intended
to
duplicate
that
coverage.
mr.
gerald
goldman
our
--
our
minimum
position
is
that
if
section
111
applies
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
--
924
(c)
does
not
apply.
mr.
gerald
goldman
one
could
read
his
state
--
but
the
precise
words
he
used
were
as
follows,
"my
proposal
is
not
intended
to
apply
to
sections
111,
112,
113
of
title
xviii
which
already
define
the
penalties
for
the
use
of
a
firearm.”
in
our
case,
it
precisely
involves
the
use
of
a
firearm,
not
to
carrying
but
the
use.
furthermore,
this
statement
is
entitled,
i
believe,
to
great
weight.
it
was
expressly
made
for
the
sake
of
legislative
history
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
introduced.
furthermore,
it
went
uncontradicted
except
for
senator
dominick
whose
own
amendment
failed
at
enactment,
no
one
suggested
a
different
interaction
to
govern
among
these
provisions.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well,
this
was
the
only
source,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
legislative
history.
any
congressman
who
wished
to
determine
the
scope
of
this
provision
had
to
look
only
to
representative
poff's
statement.
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes,
he
would
but
he
would
also,
i
presume,
look
at
the
discussion
when
the
amendment
was
introduced.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well,
there's
no
question
that
there
is
ambiguity
in
this
statute.
that
has
to
be
the
necessary
conclusion
from
this
court's
decision
in
simpson.
at
the
very
least,
the
parties
are
--
agree
that
simpson
holds
that
924
(c)
does
not
apply
to
a
violation
of
an
enhancement
provision
as
in
the
bank
robbery
statute
or
as
in
section
111.
to
that
extent,
it's
agreed
that
924
(c)
has
exceptions.
that
is
established
by
simpson.
now,
what
seems
very
convincing
to
us
is
that
the
justice
department
itself
when
it
first
analyzed
this
statute,
focused
exactly
on
representative
poff's
statement
and
said,
“we
adopt
this
as
official
policy.”
at
the
very,
very
least,
that
must
indicate
an
ambiguity
in
this
situation
that
under
the
rule
of
lenity
it
must
be
resolved
in
the
defendant's
favor.
that's
not
all
that
we
have
here.
we
also
have
the
principle
that
calls
for
a
more
specific
criminal
statute
to
govern
where
two
statutes
addressed
the
same
concern.
the
court
has
already
analyzed
these
various
considerations
and
weighed
them
carefully
and
come
to
a
conclusion.
it
did
that
in
simpson
against
united
states.
in
simpson,
the
petitioners
attacked
sentences
under
the
enhancement
provisions
of
both
the
bank
robbery
statute
and
section
924
(c),
but
contrary
to
the
suggestion
that
the
government
is
trying
to
make
that
simpson
merely
forbids
double
enhancement,
the
petitioners
there
weren't
arguing
simply
against
double
enhancement.
they
maintained
instead
that
924
(c)
does
not
apply
at
all
where
its
purpose
is
already
served
by
a
preexisting
statute
that
it
--
that
is
designed
to
deter
the
use
of
firearms.
accordingly,
those
petitioners
asked
to
have
their
section
924
(c)
convictions
vacated
even
though
the
heaviest
sentences
they
received
had
been
imposed
under
the
enhancement
paragraph
of
the
bank
robbery
statute.
and
the
court
responded
by
concluding,
"congress
cannot
be
said
to
have
authorized
the
imposition
of
the
additional
penalty
of
section
924
(c)
for
commission
of
bank
robbery
with
firearms
already
subject
to
enhanced
punishment."
in
fact,
the
court
went
beyond
that.
the
court
specifically
endorsed
the
justice
department's
original
interpretation
of
this
provision.
furthermore,
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
simpson
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
about
the
true
import
of
that
decision.
the
court
there
found
the
legislative
history
instructive
not
merely
because
it
indicated
a
congressional
version
to
a
cumulative
punishment,
but
because
it
underlined
the
limited
scope
of
the
provision.
they
adopt
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes
it
was
on
remand.
the
court
remanded
the
case.
mr.
gerald
goldman
no,
the
court
ordered
that
case
be
remanded
for
further
proceedings
in
accordance
with
the
opinion.
the
opinion
specifically
concluded
that
924
(c)
should
not
apply
and
that
relief
was
awarded
by
the
lower
courts
on
remand.
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes
and
the
reason
for
that
--
the
way
i
would
put
it
is,
the
court
held
that
there
could
not
be
sentences
under
both
provisions
because
924
(c)
did
not
apply
where
the
statutes
overlap.
mr.
gerald
goldman
exactly.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well
i
don't
believe
the
lower
courts
really
had
a
choice
because
the
court
instructed
that
there
be
further
proceedings
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
and
the
opinion
specifically
endorsed
the
justice
department's
position
that
924
(c)
doesn't
apply
because
of
the
rule
of
specificity.
mr.
gerald
goldman
that
--
that
is
literally
so,
yes.
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes.
mr.
gerald
goldman
that's
correct.
i'm
sorry,
in
a
--
in
a
assault
case.
mr.
gerald
goldman
but
the
same
principle
would
be
also
true
for
the
bank
robbery.
mr.
gerald
goldman
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes
and
we
also
maintain
that
the
rationale
of
simpson
permits
no
other
no
other
--
no
other
conclusion.
the
adoption
of
the
poff
amendment
said
by
its
author
not
to
apply
to
preexisting
enhancement
statutes
and
the
rejection
of
the
dominick
amendment
said
by
its
author
to
apply
to
these
statutes,
persuaded
the
court
that
congress
meant
to
confine
924
(c)
to
felonies
that
were
not
already
subject
to
an
enhanced
penalty
for
firearm
was
used
in
their
commission.
even
more
pointedly,
the
court's
invocation
of
the
rule
that
dictates
that
the
more
specific
criminal
statute
governs,
it
leaves
no
choice
about
this
matter.
that
principle
could
only
have
been
invoked
to
dictate
that
924
(c)
gave
way
to
the
bank
robbery
statute.
logically,
there
was
no
other
way
of
--
of
invoking
that
principle.
now,
considerations
of
stare
decisis
ought
to
weigh
very
heavily
in
this
area.
not
only
is
this
a
question
purely
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
congress
at
this
very
moment
has
under
act
of
consideration,
legislation
directly
on
point.
in
proposing
bills
to
recodify
title
xviii,
both
the
house
and
the
senate
have
suggested
provisions
that
would
unify
and
rationalize
the
entire
field
of
enhanced
penalties
to
deter
the
use
of
firearms.
both
statu
--
both
proposed
statutes
would
bring
together
in
one
section
all
preexisting
provisions
and
furthermore
would've
proposed
penalties
much
more
in
line
with
section
111
than
with
section
924
(c).
mr.
gerald
goldman
these
are
the
pending
bills
to
recodify
it,
yes.
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes.
mr.
gerald
goldman
we
don't
believe
that
that
vote
undercuts
his
initial
explanation
in
any
way,
no.
mr.
gerald
goldman
that's
correct.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
ambiguity
in
his
introductory
explanation
that
makes
it
necessary
to
look
at
later
events
to
decipher
what
he
meant.
the
interesting
thing
is
that
the
action
actually
taken
by
the
conference
committee
cuts
just
the
other
way.
it
shows
that
congress
was
prepared
to
have
litigation
in
these
circumstances.
so
that
there
was
--
there'd
be
no
inconsistency
in
concluding
that
congress
intended
section
111
to
govern
to
the
exclusion
of
924
(c).
it's
very
difficult
to
make
anything
of
an
action
taken
by
the
conference
committee
against
us
on
this
point
notwithstanding
that
representative
poff
voted
against
the
bill,
fact
is
that
congress
adopted
it.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well,
i
guess
our
position
is
that
we
don't
really
see
any
tension
between
his
introductory
statement
and
his
ultimate
vote.
what
congressman
poff
was
concerned
about
was
establishing
a
deterrent
to
the
use
of
firearms
where
no
deterrent
already
existed.
where
one
already
existed,
he
wasn't
concerned
with
the
problem.
congress
simply
didn't
choose
to
duplicate
coverage
that
already
existed.
as
i
say,
the
--
at
the
very
least,
given
the
fact
that
the
justice
department
agreed
with
us
only
--
less
than
10
years
ago,
one
has
to
conclude
that
there's
ambiguity
about
this
matter
and
if
that's
true,
we
have
to
win
under
the
rule
of
lenity.
mr.
gerald
goldman
i
believe
the
court
held
in
simpson
that
924
(c)
does
constitute
a
separate
crime.
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes,
i
think
you
could
although
924
(c)
by
its
terms
contemplates
that
there
will
be
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes.
mr.
gerald
goldman
that's
correct,
yes.
it's
unclear,
i'm
not
sure
the
government
would
have
to
actually
charge
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
--
the
other
felony,
but
yes
it
would
most
certainly
have
to
prove
it.
mr.
gerald
goldman
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well,
i
believe
the
course
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
that's
true.
there
is
a
lesser
included
offense
which
is
the
other
felony.
mr.
gerald
goldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i'll
try
to
be
brief.
i
think
the
most
recent
colloquy
very
happily
demonstrates
that
this
case
cannot
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
an
analysis
of
anomalies.
there
are
anomalies
all
over
the
place
and
it
won't
do
for
the
government
to
point
to
those
to
justify
its
position.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well
i
think
he
very
accurately
stated
what
he
meant.
we
are
not
addressing
the
interplay
of
these
provisions
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
well
because
i
think
his
words
accurately
conveyed
his
thoughts.
i
believe
those
who
listened
to
him
and
read
what
had
to
say
agreed
with
that.
the
fact
is
that
some
of
these
preexisting
statutes
do
read
in
terms
of
shall.
that's
true
of
the
provision
in
2114
and
under
simpson
its
clear
that
a
prosecution
can't
rely
under
2114
and
under
924
(c).
the
proper
resolution
is
indeed
the
one
that
representative
poff
said
he
intend
to.
mr.
gerald
goldman
but
that
would
be
to
contradict
the
shall
mandatory
language
in
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
statutes
both
of
which
provide
for
mandatory
sentencing.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well
simpson
was
quite
clearly
correctly
decided
this.
the
--
at
a
minimum.
mr.
gerald
goldman
mr.
poff's
statement
is
understood
by
everybody
to
forbid
cumulative
sentencing.
in
fact
i
think
it's
helpful
just
to
quote
for
a
second
from
the
justice
department's
own
u.s.
attorneys
bulletin
in
the
1971.
they
said
then
a
number
of
federal
statutes
already
include
special
provisions
providing
for
increase
penalties
where
firearms
is
used
in
the
commission
of
the
offense
and
they
gave
some
examples
including
section
111.
since
the
specific
provisions
of
these
statutes
may
take
precedence
over
the
general
provisions
of
section
924
(c)
(1),
the
specific
provision
should
be
used
where
applicable.
now,
it
doesn't
assist
the
government's
case
to
emphasize
the
deterrent
purpose
of
section
924
(c).
if
it
is
necessary
to
accomplish
congress'
purpose
to
apply
924
(c)
then
it's
necessary
to
do
that
in
every
single
case
and
yet
even
the
government
concedes
that
there's
been
no
implied
repeal
of
section
111.
just
to
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
but
there
is
even
an
implied
repealed
pro
tanto
for
the
area
of
the
overlap,
the
government
concedes
that.
mr.
gerald
goldman
yes
that's
true
but
in
bachelder
there
was
affirmative
evidence
that
congress
intended
precisely
that
result.
moreover
neither
statute
in
bachelder
there
could
be
said
to
be
more
specific
than
the
other.
present
case
is
distinguishable
in
both
counts.
mr.
gerald
goldman
but
that's
not
true
across
the
board.
some
of
the
penalties
in
the
preexisting
statutes
--
are
more
serious.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well
i
can
only
repeat
our
position
that
the
person
who
sponsored
this
provision
said
in
what
we
regard
to
be
absolutely
unequivocal
language
that
he
did
not
intend
to
address
the
problem
of
statutes
where
there
is
already
a
deterrent
purpose
being
served.
the
normal
presumption
i
would
think
would
be
that
congress
does
not
intend
to
duplicate
itself
in
enacting
criminal
laws
and
yet
that's
exactly
what
the
government
is
suggesting
here.
now
that
happened
in
bachelder,
but
there
was
affirmative
evidence
to
that
effect.
in
this
case
the
evidence
is
just
the
other
way.
in
addition,
there
is
an
additional
tool
of
statutory
construction
in
the
interpretive
preference
for
specific
criminal
laws
that
applies
here
and
it
did
not
apply
in
bachelder.
one
last
word
it's
our
position
that
when
a
sentence
is
vacated
that
also
serves
to
vacate
the
conviction
because
a
judgment
of
conviction
requires
a
sentence
under
the
federal
rules
so
that
when
the
sentence
was
vacated
on
remand
in
simpson
that
also
served
to
vacate
the
conviction.
mr.
gerald
goldman
well
i
--
i
think
the
question
is
whether
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
well
i
think
the
question
is
whether
resentencing
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
and
in
addition
to
the
question
is
whether
resentencing
is
permissible
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
gerald
goldman
and
in
simpson
--
mr.
gerald
goldman
--
there
should
be
no
new
sentence.
yes
sir.
mr.
gerald
goldman
thank
you
