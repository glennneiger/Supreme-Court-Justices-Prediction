justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
--
he
would
look
first
i
would
think
to
the
statute
itself,
wouldn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
--
if
there
were
ambiguity,
your
--
in
--
uncertainty
as
to
what
it
meant
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
make
anything
of
congressman
poff's
vote
against
the
conference
report
in
your
interpretation
of
legislative
history?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
explanation
of
why
he
voted
against
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
says
we
--
you
--
your
--
you
had
to
take
the
bitter
with
a
sweet
to
a
certain
extent,
that
we
--
you
used
congressman
poff
when
he's
available
to
help
you,
but
you
reject
him
when
he
is
not
on
your
side.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
also
–
could
have
–
could
and
probably
was
on
the
evidence
convicted
of
carrying
a
firearm
unlawfully,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
he
--
didn't
he
--
didn't
he
have
a
felony
record
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
was
carried
unlawfully?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
term
“unit
of
prosecution”
a
“word
of
art”
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
but
i
–
do
you
derive
it
from
a
higher
authority
than
your
own
use?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
--
does
924
(c)
involved
just
the
firearms?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
dead
--
deadly
weapon
is
broader
which
is
in
term
i
believe
the
use
of
111
is
broader
than
firearm.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
--
you
can
--
i
would
think
we
had
simpson
to
say
you
--
the
holding
is
you
cannot
have
consecutive
sentences.
you're
asking
for
a
much
broader
reading
that
says,
“you
can't
choose
which
statute
to
prosecute
under
even
though
it's
only
imposed
only
one
sentence.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opposing
counsel
points
to
irrational
results,
you
point
to
irrational
results.
do
you
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
comment
anomalies
and
bizarre
cases
under
one
or
both
constructions
more
or
less
balance
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
executive
branch
is
not
alone
if
there
are
anomalies
because
there
are
certainly
are
wide
variances
in
exercise
of
sentencing
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
power
by
the
federal
judges
as
well.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
providing
that
he
was
charged
under
9
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
judge
under
simpson
must
now
in
view
of
the
word
shall
give
him
a
sentence
under
924
(c)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
made
a
lot
of
errors
than
in
our
vacation
of
sentences
after
the
furman
case
where
we
vacated
sentences,
but
left
conviction
standing.
