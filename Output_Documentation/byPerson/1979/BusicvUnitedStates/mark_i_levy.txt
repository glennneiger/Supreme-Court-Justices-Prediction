mr.
mark
i.
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
june
of
1968,
the
congress
alarmed
by
recent
public
tragedies
and
arising
incidents
of
firearm
related
crimes
passed
the
gun
control
act.
among
the
principal
provisions
of
that
act
is
section
924
(c)
which
focuses
directly
on
the
crime
problem
by
punishing
the
use
and
unlawful
carrying
of
firearms
in
a
commission
of
federal
felonies.
by
its
terms,
section
924
(c)
is
applicable
to
the
commission
of
any
federal
felony,
nevertheless,
petitioners
argued
that
they
fall
outside
the
scope
of
section
924
(c)
because
the
underlying
or
predicate
felony
of
which
they
where
convicted,
assault
on
federal
officers,
provides
an
enhance
penalty
for
using
a
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon
to
commit
the
assault.
they
contend
that
the
enhancement
provision
of
the
predicate
felony
operates
to
the
absolute
exclusion
of
section
924
(c)
and
that
the
government
is
not
authorized
to
prosecute
under
or
the
district
court
to
sentence
under
section
924
(c)
whenever
the
underlying
offense
contains
its
own
enhancement
provision
for
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon.
in
support
of
their
contention,
petitioners
rely
on
this
court's
decision
in
simpson
versus
united
states.
they
assert
first
that
the
holding
in
simpson
governs
the
instant
case
and
second,
that
the
court's
analysis
in
simpson
compels
the
result
they
urge
here.
we
submit
however
that
the
issue
in
simpson
and
the
issue
in
this
case
are
quite
different
and
that
neither
the
holding
nor
the
reasoning
of
simpson
is
controlling
here.
the
defendants
in
simpson
having
convicted
of
armed
bank
robbery
and
have
been
given
both
an
enhanced
punishment
under
the
bank
robbery
statute
and
a
consecutive
punishment
under
section
924
(c).
thus,
the
issue
in
simpson
was
whether
cumulative
sentences
for
the
use
of
a
firearm
could
be
imposed
under
the
enhancement
provision
of
the
bank
robbery
statute
and
under
9
--
section
924
(c).
in
other
words,
whether
the
defendant's
sentence
could
be
doubly
enhances.
after
noting
at
several
places
in
the
opinion
that
this
was
the
issue
for
decision,
the
court
held
that
congress
had
not
intended
to
authorize
such
double
enhancement
and
therefore
that
the
defendant's
use
of
a
firearm
could
not
be
consecutively
punished
for
the
section
924
(c)
offense
and
for
the
aggravated
bank
robbery.
this
holding,
the
cumulative
enhanced
punishment
for
use
of
a
firearm,
are
not
permitted
by
section
924
(c),
does
not
dispose
of
the
distinct
issue
presented
in
this
case
whether
section
924
(c)
is
applicable
at
all
where
the
predicate
felony
contains
an
enhancement
provision
but
their
provision
is
not
invoked
and
that's
the
defendant's
sentence
is
not
doubly
enhanced.
it
is
one
thing
to
hold
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
of
using
a
gun
be
twice
punished.
it
is
a
far
different
matter
to
hold,
as
petitioner
seek
here,
that
congress
intended
the
penalties
provided
in
section
924
(c)
to
be
wholly
irrelevant.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
would
be
relevant.
i
think
that
sort
of
language
would
exceed
the
scope
of
the
issue
presented
in
simpson.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
it
would.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
had
the
court
said
that?
i
think
that's
right
but
i
don't
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
think
starting
a
step
further
back
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
somewhat
unusual
issue
in
simpson
of
double
enhancing
use
of
a
firearm.
that's
quite
uncommon
under
the
federal
code
and
i
think
the
court
was
simply
not
satisfied
that
congress
had
intended
that
unusually
severe
result
given
the
language
and
legislative
history
and
other
factors
that
were
cited
by
the
court
in
simpson.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
in
simpson
held
that
they
–
that
the
defendants
there
couldn't
be
twice
punished
because
they
couldn't
be
punished
at
all
under
924
(c).
i
do
not
read
the
opinion
to
say
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
right.
i
do
disagree
with
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
absolutely.
that
is
this
case.
beyond
the
holding,
the
analysis
employed
in
simpson
also
does
not
require
the
conclusion
that
section
924
(c)
is
applicable
simply
because
the
underlying
felony
provides
an
enhanced
penalty
for
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon.
the
court
in
simpson
relied
on
three
general
considerations.
first,
that
the
double
enhancement
of
punishments
was
not
necessary
to
promote
the
purpose
or
the
deterrence
rationale
of
section
924
(c).
second
that
the
legislative
history
and
particularly
a
statement
by
congressman
poff
on
the
floor
of
the
house
pointed
in
the
direction
of
a
congressional
intent
not
to
allow
sentences
to
be
doubly
enhanced.
and
third,
that
several
canons
of
statutory
construction
supported
the
view
that
double
enhancement
was
not
authorized
by
section
924
(c).
looking
to
each
of
these
factors
in
turn,
it
can
be
seen
that
none
of
them
supports
the
result
urged
by
petitioners.
first,
the
statutory
structure
and
purpose;
the
penalty
provision
of
section
924
(c)
are
unique
and
having
been
specifically
designed
to
punish
and
deter
firearm
violations,
they
are
fundamentally
different
both
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
from
the
penalties
provided
in
section
111.
with
respect
to
the
length
of
sentences,
section
924
(c)
specifies
an
increased
punishment
for
using
a
firearm
of
up
to
10
years
for
first
offense
and
up
to
25
years
for
a
second
or
subsequent
offense.
in
contrast,
section
111
increases
the
penalty
where
a
dangerous
weapon
is
used
by
only
seven
years.
in
addition,
section
924
(c)
provides
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
one
year
for
first
offenders
and
two
years
for
second
and
subsequent
offenders.
section
111
provides
no
mandatory
minimum
penalty.
section
924
(c)
also
establishes
more
severe
penalties
for
recidivists
than
for
first
offenders.
section
111
on
the
other
hand
makes
no
provision
for
the
imposition
of
increased
sentences
on
recidivists.
finally,
section
924
(c)
restricts
the
availability
of
probation,
suspended
sentences,
and
concurrent
sentences.
in
contrast,
section
111
provides
no
such
limitations
on
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
judge
to
exercise
leniency.
petitioners
have
offered
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
meant
section
924
(c)
to
be
inapplicable
here.
in
our
view
given
the
differences
and
penalty
structures
and
given
that
the
gun
control
act
was
specifically
designed
to
address
the
problem
of
firearms,
it
seems
inconceivable
that
congress
intended
that
a
defendant
who
uses
a
firearm
to
assault
the
federal
officer
would
be
completely
exempt
from
sentence
under
section
924
(c)
and
would
instead
be
subject
only
to
the
lesser
punishment
provided
in
section
111.
thus,
unlike
in
simpson
where
the
court
concluded
that
double
enhancement
was
unnecessary
to
achieve
the
deterrence
rationale
in
section
924
(c).
the
decision
in
section
924
(c)
is
wholly
inapplicable
in
the
instant
case
would
disregard
the
special
penalties
provided
in
that
statute
and
what
frustrate
the
purposes
of
the
gun
control
act.
moreover,
again
in
contrast
to
simpson
to
hold
here
that
section
924
(c)
does
not
apply
whenever
the
predicate
felony
contains
an
enhancement
provision
for
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
would
lead
to
several
illogical
results
that
are
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
that
congress
surely
did
not
intend.
the
first
consequences
of
such
a
holding
would
be
that
the
defendant
who
uses
a
firearm
to
assault
the
federal
officer
would
be
subject
to
different
and
less
onerous
penalties
than
one
who
uses
a
firearm
to
commit
virtually
any
other
federal
offense.
indeed,
this
result
would
have
the
particularly
perverse
effect
rendering
stiff
penalty
provisions
of
section
924
(c)
inapplicable
to
the
very
felonies
that
congress
had
previously
singled
out
for
greater
rather
than
lesser
deterrence
and
punishment.
congress
could
not
rationally
have
intended
section
924
(c)
to
produce
such
a
result.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
do
not.
i
don't
think
our
position
does
produce
any
anomalous
results.
first
section
2114
upon
which
petitioners
rely
to
produce
such
results,
i
understand
does
not
have
the
same
sorts
of
limitations
on
probations,
suspended
sentences,
and
concurrent
sentences
that
section
924
(c)
does.
but
beyond
that
it
seems
to
me
the
correct
answer
to
these
asserted
anomalies
is
to
vest
in
the
prosecutor
the
discretion
in
this
area
as
in
virtually
all
other
areas
to
select
the
proper
charge
in
any
given
case
commensurate
with
the
conduct
that
is
alleged.
i
think
that
prosecutor
of
discretion
would
eliminate
any
conceivable
anomalies
that
might
otherwise
arise.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
are
differences
among
prosecutors.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
correct
it's
on
review
when
uncontrolled
and
it
is
also
quite
common
there
is
nothing
different
about
this
area.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
within
the
executive
branch
in
terms
of
an
administrative
criteria
there
are
guidelines
that
are
used
in
some
areas
to
control
prosecutors
in
u.s.
attorney's
office
it's
--
we
--
i
agree
that
those
are
not
subject
to
review
by
a
court.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well
i
think
they're
all
–
well
first,
i
don't
think
again
that
this
area
is
any
different
than
any
other
and
it
seems
to
me
the
prosecutorial
discretion
is
at
the
very
least
unavoidable
and
is
in
fact
desirable
in
order
to
fit
the
charge
to
the
particular
case.
but
beyond
that
i
think
that
the
consequences
of
not
allowing
such
discretion
here
and
imposing
the
rigid
and
very
narrow
view
words
by
petitioners
would
be
far
worst.
another
illogical
result
of
the
petitioners;
construction
would
be
the
defendant
who
use
a
gun
to
assault
a
federal
officer
and
one
who
uses
some
other
dangerous
weapon
such
as
a
knife
would
both
be
sentenced
under
exactly
the
same
penalty
provisions
of
section
111.
such
a
result
would
be
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
section
924
to
punish
with
special
severity
the
criminal
use
of
firearms.
moreover,
since
the
recidivist
provisions
of
section
924
extend
only
to
a
second
or
subsequent
conviction
under
that
section,
petitioners'
interpretation
would
mean
that
a
defendant
who
on
several
occasions
uses
a
firearm
to
assault
federal
officers
would
not
be
covered
by
those
repeat
offender
provisions
and
indeed
he
would
remain
outside
those
provisions
even
if
he
later
uses
a
firearm
to
commit
some
other
federal
offence.
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendant
who
twice
uses
a
firearm
to
commit
virtually
any
other
federal
felony
would
be
subject
to
those
harsher
penalties.
the
recidivist
provisions
were
designed
to
punish
with
heightened
severity.
those
people
who
have
shown
themselves
to
be
recurrent
abusers
of
firearms
and
no
reason
suggested
so
why
congress
would
have
wanted
the
applicability
of
the
recidivist
provisions
to
depend
upon
whether
the
prior
armed
offense
consisted
of
an
assault
instead
of
almost
any
other
federal
felony.
finally
if
we
are
correct
as
we
contend
in
our
brief
and
we
rely
on
the
argument
there
that
section
924
(c)
at
all
events
prohibits
the
unlawful
carrying
of
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
an
assault
on
a
federal
officer.
petitioners'
construction
would
mean
that
the
defendant
who
actually
uses
the
firearm
would
be
subject
solely
to
section
111
while
the
defendant
who
only
carries
but
does
not
use
a
firearm
would
be
sentenced
under
the
more
stringent
provisions
of
section
924
(c).
well
congress
wanted
to
punish
and
deter
both
the
use
and
the
unlawful
carrying
of
firearms.
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
more
severe
sanctions
for
unlawfully
carrying
a
firearm
and
for
its
actual
use.
in
sum,
the
first
consideration
relied
on
in
simpson,
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
demonstrates
here
that
section
924
(c)
is
not
inapplicable
where
the
predicate
felony
contains
its
own
enhancement
provision.
the
legislative
history
of
section
924
(c)
the
second
factor
relied
on
in
simpson
also
demonstrates
that
an
armed
assault
on
a
federal
officer
is
punishable
under
section
924
(c).
this
history
makes
it
plain
that
congress
wanted
to
punish
and
to
deter
by
means
of
stern
measures
the
criminal
use
of
firearms.
congress
recognized
that
this
objective
turned
on
a
certainty
as
well
as
the
severity
of
punishment.
congressman
poff
in
introducing
the
amendment
that
ultimately
formed
the
basis
for
section
924
(c)
expressly
stated
that
his
proposal
was
stronger
than
the
then
pending
casey
amendment
because
it
restricted
the
imposition
of
concurrent
sentences,
suspended
sentences
and
probation.
the
importance
of
this
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes
i
do.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well
i
think
it's
consistent
if
you
look
at
senator
--
congressman
poff's
statements
in
their
entirety.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
statement
relied
on
by
the
court
in
simpson
which
was
an
isolated
statement
which
elicited
no
discussion
and
which
was
not
directed
to
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
can
be
given
dispositive
weight
here.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
alright.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
introducing
his
amendment,
congressman
poff
emphasized
that
his
proposal
was
stronger
than
the
casey
amendment
which
was
then
pending
before
the
congress
because
it
had
the
limitations
on
the
exercise
of
the
trial
judges'
leniency
discretion.
congressman
poff
later
reiterated
the
importance
of
these
features
of
his
amendment
and
they
were
likewise
stressed
by
other
congressmen
who
stressed
the
need
to
confine
sentencing
discretion
in
order
to
provide
a
significant
only
greater
deterrent
and
generally
was
found
an
existing
law
and
in
the
end
after
this
discussion
the
house
adopted
the
poff
amendment
by
vote
of
412
to
11.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no
if
i
could
finish
reciting
the
general
legislative
history
and
congressman
poff's
statements
as
i
said
congress
of
poff
had
emphasized
several
times
the
importance
of
the
unique
provisions
of
his
proposal
and
indeed
he
felt
so
strongly
about
these
provisions
that
when
a
conference
committee
weakened
to
some
extent
his
amendment,
he
eventually
voted
against
the
conference
report.
the
conference
committee
had
weakened
his
proposal
by
eliminating
the
restriction
on
concurrent
sentences
and
limiting
to
repeat
offenders
the
restrictions
on
suspended
sentences
and
probation.
congressman
poff
found
it
so
insignificant
that
he
voted
against
the
report.
that
time
he
said
it
is
not
the
severity
of
punishment
that
deters,
it
is
the
certainty
of
punishment
that
deters.
in
a
posture
which
the
conference
report
leaves
it
the
amendment
will
not
promote
certainty
of
punishment
whether
with
respect
to
the
first
offence
actual
time
in
jail
will
be
no
more
certain
than
it
is
today.
given
these
clear
views
underneath
for
certainty
of
punishment
to
deter
armed
felons,
it
is
impossible
we
think
to
conclude
that
congressman
poff
intended
that
defendants
who
use
firearms
to
assault
federal
officers
would
be
excluded
all
together
from
section
924
(c)
and
instead
would
be
punished
solely
under
the
existing
enhancement
provision
of
section
111.
a
provi
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
said
it
did
not
apply
where
the
provision
provided
a
penalty
for
the
use
of
the
dangerous
weapon.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well
that
is
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
what
he
said.
we
think
the
construction
of
those
words
is
best
used
what
the
court
held
in
simpson
that
congressman
poff
was
concerned
about
the
double
enhancement
of
penalties
where
the
underlying
the
predicate
felony.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
excuse
me?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that
that
is
what
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
what
the
court
said
about
poff's
statement
after
quoting
it
was
that
his
view
was
consistent
with
the
deterrent
rationale
of
section
924
(c).
i
read
that
to
mean
that
it
was
consistent
because
there
was
no
need
for
double
enhancement
in
order
to
promote
the
deterrent
rationale
of
the
statute.
with
respect
to
the
other
portions
of
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no
i
think
even
more
accurately
we
would
say
that
924
(c)
does
not
apply
when
the
enhancement
provision
of
those
predicate
felonies
has
been
involved.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
exactly.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
exactly
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
read
it
in
light
of
the
other
statements
and
actions
by
congressman
poff
in
the
house.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
it
is
then
i
agree.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
the
subsequent
event
that
you
just
referred
to
was
the
conference
committee's
rejection
of
the
dominick
amendment
which
has
been
passed
by
the
senate.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
that
the
other
evidence
the
court
found
was
the
committee's
rejection
of
the
dominick
amendment.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
supported
the
statement
of
congressman
poff
in
the
context
of
double
enhancement.
the
dominick
amendment
had
been
limited
to
certain
enumerated
predicate
felonies
and
we
read
the
committee's
rejection
of
that
amendment
in
favor
of
the
broader
poff
proposal
to
mean
that
congress
intended
that
924
(c)
would
be
broadly
rather
than
narrowly
applicable.
but
with
particular
respect
to
simpson,
the
dominick
amendment
had
also
allowed
the
double
enhancement
of
penalties
in
exactly
the
way
that
the
defendants
in
simpson
had
been
punished
and
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
for
the
aggravated
offence
i
think
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
that
simpson
holds
that
he
has
to
choose
between
them
and
that
they
cannot
sentence
under
both.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
do
not
think
it
limits
the
prosecution.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
i
believe
--
the
court
thought
that
congress
could
not
authorize
the
double
enhancement
of
punishment
to
the
consecutive
sentences
under
both
statutes.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
do.
i
think
that
is
the
full
extent
of
the
simpson
holding.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
dominick
amendment
had
allowed
the
double
enhancement
of
punishments
in
a
way
that
the
court
in
simpson
held
congress
had
not
intended.
the
court
in
reaching
that
result
had
relied
on
the
rejection
of
the
dominick
amendment
that
in
the
court's
in
view
corroborated
their
reading
of
the
poff
statement.
i
don't
think
that
the
rejection
of
the
dominick
amendment
bears
on
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
whether
the
prosecutor
has
discretion
to
prosecute
under
924
(c)
in
lieu
of
prosecution
under
the
enhancement
provision
of
section
111.
in
addition
to
the
legislative
history,
the
court
in
simpson
also
relied
on
several
maximums
of
statutory
construction.
in
this
case
those
maximums
do
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
section
924
(c)
is
inapplicable
whenever
the
predicate
felony
provides
for
an
enhanced
penalty.
the
court
in
simpson
first
invoked
the
usual
role
of
avoiding
constitutional
decisions
where
possible.
in
simpson,
the
government
had
relied
on
identical
evidence
to
prove
violations
of
sections
924
(c)
and
2113
(d)
the
aggravated
provision
of
the
bank
robbery
statute
and
the
defendants
who'd
received
consecutive
sentences
under
those
statutes.
in
such
circumstances
the
court
observed
that
there
was
the
prospect
of
double
jeopardy
and
following
settled
practice,
it
does
look
to
see
whether
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
fairly
possible
to
avoid
the
potential
constitutional
issue.
here
in
contrast
no
analogous
constitutional
question
is
involved
because
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
petitioner's
sentence
cannot
be
doubly
enhanced
for
the
use
of
a
firearm
and
hence
this
cannon
of
construction
is
not
pertinent
here.
the
court
in
simpson
also
relied
on
the
rule
of
lenity.
however,
this
rule
is
simply
an
auxiliary
aid
in
discerning
the
congressional
intent
and
it
applies
only
when
a
court
has
looked
to
all
other
available
sources
for
guidance
on
the
meaning
of
a
statute
and
is
still
left
with
a
serious
ambiguity
or
uncertainty.
moreover
as
the
court
has
recognized
on
other
occasions
even
a
criminal
statute
is
not
to
be
so
strictly
construed
that
the
legislative
purpose
is
defeated.
given
the
structure,
purpose,
and
legislative
history
of
section
924
(c)
in
giving
the
untenable
results
to
what
occur
under
petitioners'
construction,
the
rule
of
lenity
does
not
bear
on
a
present
issue.
finally
the
court
in
simpson
referred
to
the
principle
that
precedents
be
given
to
the
more
specific
of
the
two
statutes.
however,
this
principle
cannot
be
determinative
whereas
here
the
language,
purpose,
and
history
of
the
act
consistently
point
in
the
opposite
direction.
moreover,
we
do
not
understand
the
court
in
simpson
to
have
held
as
a
general
matter
that
only
one
criminal
statute
can
apply
to
a
given
situation
simply
because
that
statute
maybe
considered
to
be
the
most
specific.
such
a
proposition
would
be
of
dubious
soundness
and
would
contradict
many
long
standing
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
have
consistently
held
to
the
contrary
and
have
allowed
the
prosecutor
discretion
to
choose
among
two
or
more
statutes
that
apply
to
a
given
set
of
facts.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
simpson
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
they
carried
the
924
(c)
sentences.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
do
not
believe
they
vacated
the
conviction.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
simpson
the
more
severe
penalty
had
been
imposed
on
a
2113
(d)
count.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
so
the
issue
didn't
really
arise
whether
the
government
wanted
to
proceed
with
the
924
account.
we
think
the
court
in
simpson
relied
on
the
doctrine
of
specificity
only
to
illustrate
that
there
are
instances
other
than
the
particular
one
in
simpson
in
which
two
statutes
are
not
simultaneously
applicable
to
a
given
situation
despite
their
literal
language.
in
this
way
the
notion
of
specificity
served
to
corroborate
the
conclusion
already
drawn
from
a
legislative
history
of
section
924
(c)
and
from
the
rule
of
lenity.
however,
this
doctrine
is
in
opposite
in
the
instant
case.
since
section
924
(c)
and
the
enhancement
provision
of
section
111
are
not
being
simultaneously
applied
to
petitioners.
the
court
in
simpson
also
cited
to
a
prior
department
of
justice
position
on
the
applicability
of
section
924
(c).
i
think
a
reading
of
the
united
states
attorney's
bulletin
and
cited
by
the
court
in
simpson
will
show
that
–
that
the
bulletin
was
not
meant
to
be
a
definitive
legal
interpretation
of
the
statute
but
rather
was
designed
as
advise
to
u.s.
attorneys
to
be
aware
of
and
avoid
possible
problems
under
the
statute.
indeed
the
bulletin
and
expressly
recognized
that
section
924
(c)
could
be
charged
in
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutor
even
where
the
predicate
offense
contained
in
enhancement
provision.
therefore
we
do
not
feel
that
the
court's
citation
to
the
u.s.
attorneys
bulletin.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes
we
do.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes
in
the
separate
count
of
the
indictment
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct
the
statute
shall.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
order
to
have
an
enhanced
sentence.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
would
think
a
prosecutor
would
have
discretion
not
to
try
the
9
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
statute
says
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
shall
be
punished
when
he
had
been
convicted,
i
don't
think
the
statute
directs
that
the
prosecutor
in
ever
in
case
bring
all
conceivable
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes
i
do
and
i
also
think
it
would
be
quite
proper
in
an
appropriate
case
to
charge
just
the
underlying
felony
and
not
charge
924
(c).
there's
no
requirement
that
the
prosecutor
in
all
cases
where
it
is
available
prosecute
the
defendants
to
the
fullest
maximum
extent.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
i
understand
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
if
the
defendant
were
convicted
under
both.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
petitioners'
argument
in
this
case
was
not
that
it
was
mandatorily
sense
in
the
924
(c).
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but
only
that
he
shouldn't
have
been
prosecuted
at
all.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
this
case
the
issue
doesn't
arise
because
the
more
severe
sentence
was
given
under
924
(c)
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
now
i
think
the
words
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
the
work
“shall”
in
the
portion
of
924
(c)
you
just
quoted
say
“shall”
in
addition
to
the
penalty
for
the
predicate
offense
and
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
word
shall
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
word
there
shall
is
to
make
it
clear
that
the
penalty
for
924
(c)
was
in
addition
to
the
penalty
for
the
underlying
predicate
felony.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes
it
does
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
that
is
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
that
is
a
correct
interpretation
–
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
certainly
the
effect
of
the
holding
in
simpson.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
sum
we
think
the
structured
purpose
in
legislative
history
all
establish
that
section
924
(c)
is
applicable,
whereas
in
this
case
the
predicate
felony
contains
its
own
enhancement
provision.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
