justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
said
we
agree
with
you,
mr.
hicks,
that
the
statute
under
which
you
were
sentenced
is
unconstitutional.
it
would
then
follow,
i
suppose,
that
he
was
not
sentenced
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
void
or
invalid
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
if
he
is
under
any
sentence
at
all,
it
has
to
be
as
a
result
of
his
sentence
imposed
by
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
true
generally,
mr.
ebel,
that
in
oklahoma
juries
are
given
wide
latitude
in
imposing
sentences?
you
have
told
us
already
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
be
sentenced
by
the
jury
in
most
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
without
any
standards,
and
that
51(a)
which
provides
for
repeat
offenders,
gives
the
jury
discretion
to
impose
any
sentence
between
ten
years
and
life,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
quite
typical
of
oklahoma
sentencing
procedures?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
longer
than
most,
but
typical
in
giving
the
jury
no
standards,
and
allowing
the
jury
wide
discretion.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
range
may
seem
narrow
to
you
or
me,
but
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
for
the
person
sentenced.
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
five
years
and
twenty.
justice
potter
stewart
when
it
is
out
of
your
own
life.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
ms.
cox,
you
are
emphasizing
that
and
you
have
argued
that
and
it
is
very
clear
from
the
statute
that
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
does
have
that
revisory
authority.
may
i
ask
you
this
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
increased
a
jury-imposed
sentence
in
the
exercise
of
that
authority?
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
have
acted
at
all,
they
have
only
decreased
one?
justice
potter
stewart
but
when
you
modify,
it
is
only
to
decrease?
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
of
no
case
and
in
fact
you
doubt
the
power
of
the
court
to
increase
a
sentence
imposed
by
a
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
you
know
of
no
case
where
that
was
done?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
not
improper
if
there
had
been
a
valid
statute
authorizing
it,
but
there
wasn't.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
if
they
went
back
and
did
it
all
over
again,
the
judge
could
give
the
same
instruction?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
that
the
court
rejected
your
brother's
attacks
on
51(a),
he
presents
federal
questions
in
asserting
that
51(a)
itself
is
constitutionally
invalid.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
we
agree
with
you,
counsel,
presumably
what
we
would
do
is
be
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
remand
the
case
to
that
court
and
let
it
decide
what
it
wants
to
do
about
it.
