justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
didn't
say
that.
the
court
said
that
we
think
the
sentence
is
all
right,
but
they
didn't
impose
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
we
sentence
you
to
blank
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
didn't
say
that,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
asking
for
syllogism,
i
am
asking
for
facts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
affirming
different
from
sentencing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
have
been
sentenced
under
51(a)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
anyone
be
sentenced
under
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
that
the
jury
could
have
sentenced
him
under
51(a).
the
court
said
that
the
defendant
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
rules
of
this
statute
in
that
the
sentence
imposed
is
within
the
range
of
punishment
authorized
by
the
provisions
of
51(a).
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
shifting
the
rules?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
when
he
was
originally
tried,
he
couldn't
have
been
sentenced
under
51(a),
but
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
he
could
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
affirmed
51(b)?
they
said
they
couldn't
affirm
51(b)
so
they
affirmed
51(a).
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
you
have
a
death
penalty
for
first
degree
murder
and
five
years
for
manslaughter,
if
they
sentence
you
to
the
death
penalty
to
life
imprisonment
for
manslaughter,
that
is
all
right
because
they
could
have
sent
you
to
death.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
something
wrong
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
didn't
commute
this
sentence,
they
affirmed
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
affirm
an
unconstitutional
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
affirm
an
unconstitutional
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
that
this
case
reversed
thigpen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
can
you
affirm?
they
didn't,
that
is
why
they
used
51(a),
because
they
couldn't
affirm
it
on
51(b)
because
they
had
just
decided
thigpen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
interesting,
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
sure
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
man
got
forty
years.
it
is
not
interesting
to
him,
he
has
got
forty
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
of
appeals
reaffirmed
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
merely
said
it
was
unconstitutional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
from
the
way
i
read
it,
it
was
unconstitutional
before
thigpen,
according
to
what
the
court
said.
the
court
said
and
it
was
laid
to
rest
in
thigpen,
which
meant
it
had
been
dead
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said.
didn't
it
say
that?
