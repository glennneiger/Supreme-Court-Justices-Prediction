ms.
janet
l.
cox
you
have
given
us
one.
do
you
have
another
one?
ms.
janet
l.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
opposing
counsel
and
myself
do
not
differ
on
the
basic
premise
that
the
sentencing
stage
of
a
trial
proceeding
is
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
14th
amendment.
the
difference
between
my
position
and
the
position
of
my
opposing
counsel
is
that
there
is
a
determination
that
needs
to
be
made
as
to
what
process
is
due.
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
failure
of
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
remand
this
cause
for
jury
sentencing
deprived
him
of
a
procedural
right
under
section
926
of
the
oklahoma
constitution.
the
petitioner
has
gone
through
the
facts
adequately,
but
i
think
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
understand
exactly
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
in
thigpen
v.
state
when
it
invalidated
section
51(b)
which
was
the
sentencing
provision
under
which
petitioner
in
this
case
was
sentenced.
the
court
made
a
determination
and
an
interpretation
upon
the
basis
of
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
this
case
to
provide
the
progressively
greater
punishment
for
the
habitual
offender.
under
51(b),
the
punishment
was
restricted
and
there
was
a
classification
that
a
second
subsequent
offender
would
receive,
as
in
this
case
forty
years.
had
mr.
hicks
been
tried
under
51(a)
he
could
have
received
a
possible
sentence
of
life.
based
upon
that
premise,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
invalidate
the
sentencing
statute
on
the
basis
of
a
constitutional
issue,
especially
on
the
basis
of
due
process,
but
merely
that
it
did
not
comport
with
the
intent
of
the
legislature
to
provide
for
progressively
greater
punishment.
now,
the
petitioner's
entire
argument
is
predicated
on
the
fact
that
the
invalidation
of
51(b)
completely
voided
his
sentence,
and
this
is
not
true.
so
long
as
the
sentencing
statute
contains
the
severability
clause,
which
in
this
case
it
did
--
and
i
must
remind
this
court
that
we
are
not
talking
about
two
statutes,
we
are
talking
about
one
that
merely
said
divided
two
classes
of
individuals,
that
being
habitual
offenders.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
i
am
saying
that
they
held
it
to
be
vague
and
illusory
and
because
it
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
yes,
they
did
hold
it
unconstitutional
but
not
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
constitutional
issue,
that
it
denied
due
process.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that
is
correct,
and
we
are
not
trying
to
litigate
the
constitutionality
of
51(b)
but
only
as
to
what
the
court
tried
to
do
when
it
invalidated
the
statute.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
believe
it
was
an
interpretation
of
a
state
statute
based
upon
state
law
and
procedure.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
it
really
doesn't
except
that
he
has
predicated
the
invalidation
of
section
51(b)
on
the
fact
that
it
voided
the
petitioner's
sentence
and
therefore
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
effect
resentenced
the
petitioner.
and
what
i
am
trying
to
say
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that's
true.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
yes,
i
have,
your
honor.
unfortunately,
the
state
of
oklahoma
does
not
have
any
procedural
device
which
would
reempanel
a
new
jury.
i
am
also
arguing
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
exercised
its
authority
under
section
1066
to
either
modify,
affirm,
remand
or
otherwise
reverse
a
case.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
they
would
be
prohibited
from
increasing
a
sentence.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
yes,
that's
correct,
either
the
same
sentence
or
decrease
it,
which
they
have
done
under
the
decisions
following
thigpen
where
the
defendants
were
sentenced
under
section
51(b).
in
some
cases
they
have
modified
and
in
some
cases
they
have
affirmed
them.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
decrease,
yes.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
i
think
it
would
be
highly
improper
and
an
exercise
of
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
your
honor,
there
has
been
none.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
if
you
buy
the
premise
that
the
sentence
was
void.
what
i
am
trying
to
distinguish
from
here
is
the
right
to
resentence
by
jury
under
926
and
the
asserted
right
of
petitioner
to
be
resentenced
following
appellate
review.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that
is
correct.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
because
at
the
trial
court
level
he
was
given
an
opportunity
during
the
second
stage
of
the
proceedings
to
be
represented
by
counsel
to
attack
the
underlying
convictions.
that
was
all
that
due
process
requires
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
two
separate
levels.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
it
does
in
the
sense
that
the
trial
court
level,
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
because
the
sentencing
statute,
51(b),
required
a
mandatory
imposition
of
40
years.
this
court
has
already
hold
that
that
type
of
an
instruction,
in
rummel
v.
estella
last
week,
is
not
improper.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that
is
what
petitioner
argues,
it
was
simply
invalid.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
i
would
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
well,
section
51(b)
has
been
reenacted,
and
that
portion
which
would
provide
for
the
maximum
under
the
underlying
felony
has
been
deleted
from
the
statute.
i
am
not
saying
that
he
would
be
resentenced
under
51(b),
but
the
same
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that's
correct,
because
the
statute
has
been
amended.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
because
due
process
only
affords
the
right
for
him
to
be
represented
by
counsel
to
attack
the
underlying
convictions.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
relies
upon
the
case
of
klimas
and
in
that
case
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
presented
with
a
problem
similar
to
this
case
only
they
did
not
determine
that
the
underlying
statute
was
invalid.
what
they
determined
was
that
the
defendant
had
been
prejudiced
because
during
the
second
stage
certain
convictions
had
been
improperly
admitted
upon
which
the
jury
was
considering
the
punishment.
they
felt
that
this
afforded
him
substantial
prejudice
and
reversed
it
and
sent
it
back
for
resentencing.
we
don't
have
that
problem
in
this
case.
the
same
evidence
would
be
admitted
at
the
trial
court
level
on
a
second
hearing
in
this
case
as
in
the
first
one,
even
though
the
mandatory
punishment
statute
could
not
be
given
as
an
instruction.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
oklahoma
does
not
prohibit
a
defendant
from
coming
before
the
jury
to
present
mitigating
circumstances
during
the
second
stage.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
defendant
chose
to
stand
mute
as
a
procedural
trial
tactic.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that
is
correct,
but
this
court
has
upheld
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that's
correct.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
following
the
presentation
of
the
evidence
and
closing
arguments
by
counsel,
then
he
instructs
the
jury.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
yes.
in
fact,
in
this
case
there
was
in
the
opinion
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that's
correct.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
in
other
words
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
well,
the
information
put
him
on
notice,
put
the
petitioner
on
notice
when
the
charges
were
originally
filed.
he
knew
what
his
sentence
was
going
to
be.
he
knew
what
he
had
to
defend
against.
this
is
the
essence
of
due
process.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
he
did
not
qualify
under
that
class.
51(a)
is
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
what
the
court
did
when
it
invalidated
51(b)
was
take
away
that
class
of
individuals
and
lumped
them
all
to
51(a).
that
is
where
the
court
came
with
the
--
in
thigpen
they
were
trying
to
protect
those
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
i
don't
know
what
type
of
rules
you
are
talking
about.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
they
merely
affirmed
the
punishment
as
being
within
the
limits
of
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
they
merely
said
that
the
sentence
was
in
the
range
of
punishment
that
the
legislature
provided
for
the
enhancement
of
habitual
offenders.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
not
if
that
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
that
creates
--
let's
talk
about
the
death
penalty
cases
in
furman
where
a
number
of
states
had
numerous
individuals
on
death
row.
this
court
invalidated,
especially
in
woodson,
the
death
penalty.
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
invalidated
those
sentences
and
commuted
them
to
life,
and
it
is
the
same
analogy
that
we
have
in
this
case.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
but
it
is
the
same
type
of
theory
because
they
have
the
authority
to
affirm
the
sentence
of
the
jury
if
they
find
that
there
is
no
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
as
they
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
this
court
has
to
look
to
thigpen
as
to
why
the
court
declared
it
unconstitutional.
it
was
because
its
practical
application
resulted
in
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
no,
it
definitely
does
not
reverse
thigpen
at
all.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
if
anything,
the
court
could
have
remanded
the
cause.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
it
is
an
interesting
question,
but
the
court
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
the
only
remedy
the
court
had
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
what
they
were
saying
is
that
in
terms
of
due
process
he
was
afforded
his
hearing,
his
notice
and
simply
because
he
was
sentenced
under
a
statute
which
was
subsequently
found
to
be
unconstitutional,
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
intent
of
the
legislature
--
the
intent
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
they
did
not
ask
that
their
decision
apply
retroactively.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
they
merely
acknowledged
--
ms.
janet
l.
cox
they
concede
in
their
opinion
and
we
agree.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
thigpen
was
decided
after
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
sentenced.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
is
what
they
said.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that
statement,
that
what
good
would
it
do
for
the
defendant
to
get
on
the
stand
unless
he
were
taking
the
underlying
conviction
upon
which
the
enhancement
was
laid,
that
for
him
to
be
presenting
the
mitigating
circumstances,
it
would
not
affect
the
range
of
punishment
because
the
jury
had
been
instructed
to
return
a
mandatory
sentence.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
i'm
sorry,
i
missed
your
question.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that's
correct.
of
course,
the
petitioner
argues
that
he
should
be,
if
he
was
in
fact
sentenced
under
51(a),
that
the
legislation
should
contain
minimum
standards
in
order
to
determine
within
the
range
of
punishment
that
he
is
to
have.
of
course,
i
really
feel
that
the
analogy
in
this
case
does
not
apply
simply
because
if
you
have
sentencing
standards,
as
in
the
death
penalty
case,
you
are
really
looking
toward
the
individual,
and
when
you
have
discretionary
sentence
the
jury
is
looking
not
only
towards
the
offense
but
the
individual
offender,
and
the
only
thing
that
the
standards
and
guidelines
would
provide
in
a
discretionary
sentence
would
facilitate
appellate
review.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no,
i
did
not.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that's
correct,
i
did
not
argue
it
at
the
trial
court
level.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
no.
the
only
thing
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
could
do
is
reverse
the
entire
case
and
start
completely
over.
they
could
have
remanded
it.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
i
know
of
no
procedure
whereby
the
state
of
oklahoma
could
reempanel
the
jury.
i'm
sure
this
court
could,
but
how
could
the
state
of
oklahoma
facilitate
that
request.
it
would
require
legislation
or
a
violation
of
this
court's
order.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
that's
correct.
i
know
of
no
instance
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
where
a
case
has
been
remanded
specifically
resentencing
except
in
those
cases
where
the
defendant
is
sentenced
by
a
trial
judge
without
the
necessity
of
a
jury.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
oklahoma
is
unique
in
that,
yes,
and
i
didn't
realize
it
until
this
particular
case,
but
we
do
afford
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
have
his
sentence
determined
by
a
jury.
basically,
all
the
state
is
saying
is
that
basic
due
process
requires
a
hearing
on
the
trial
court
level,
which
was
given
in
this
case.
on
the
appellant
level,
where
the
court
--
where
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
granted
a
lot
of
review,
the
only
thing
that
is
required
in
that
instance
under
due
process
is
the
right
--
in
this
case
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
an
attorney
at
public
expense,
the
right
to
a
public
transcript.
he
was
entitled
to
brief
his
cause
and
to
present
errors
and
his
only
expectation
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
was
that
the
court
would
render
a
fair
and
impartial
review
of
his
sentence
and
look
for
fundamental
errors.
that
is
all
due
process
requires.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
i
would
think
so,
yes.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
well,
there
wouldn't
be
unless
the
defendant
raised
one
if
he
was
--
if
in
fact
he
went
back
and
was
resentenced
and
got
a
greater
punishment,
life,
surely
he
would
contest
that
it
was
a
denial
of
due
process
possibly
to
send
him
back
for
resentencing.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
possibly
if
he
were
resentenced.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
i
know
of
none
off
the
top
of
my
head.
ms.
janet
l.
cox
yes,
and
that
that
legislation
should
contain
minimum
sentencing
standards.
i
believe
that
is
a
due
process
question.
in
conclusion,
the
respondents,
as
i
said
before,
submit
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
been
afforded
the
full
panoply
of
the
due
process
requirements
and
procedures
which
the
laws
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
create.
the
constitution
of
this
country
does
not
provide
for
a
defendant
to
be
resentenced
anew.
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
due
process
clause
and
is
not
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
there
can
be
no
possible
conceivable
relationship
between
the
notice
requirements
at
the
trial
court
level
and
applying
them
to
the
appellate
level
other
than
what
has
been
create
by
state
statute.
the
state
would
submit
that
there
has
been
notice
in
all
due
process.
the
petitioner
also
raises
questions
of
equal
protection,
but
this
court
in
rummel
last
week
indicated
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
create
classes
of
individuals
under
the
habitural
criminal
act.
i
don't
feel
that
there
is
any
suspect
classification
or
any
reason
--
there
is
no
procedure
for
anyone
sentenced
under
51(a)
or
51(b)
which
would
violate
the
procedures
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
for
that
reason,
the
state
of
oklahoma
asks
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
and
sentence
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
thank
you.
