chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
78-6885,
hicks
v.
oklahoma.
mr.
ebel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
when
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
oklahoma
has
two
statutes,
you
really
mean
now
it
has
only
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
view
is
that
unless
the
state
took
an
appeal
to
this
court
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
federal
question
involved,
they
have
acquiesced
in
that
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
thigpen
was
decided
during
the
pendency
of
this
appeal,
could
the
state
have
gone
back
to
the
process
of
new
sentencing?
you
would
have
to
reconstitute
the
original
jury,
would
you,
if
you
were
to
try
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
hypothetically
agreed
with
you
now,
would
oklahoma
assemble
a
jury
and
go
through
the
sentencing
process
under
the
surviving
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
might
get
40
years
or
he
might
not
get
40
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
mandatory
under
51(b)
but
permissive
under
51(a),
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
probably
can't
tell
us,
but
was
there
any
indication
that
you
are
aware
of
that
the
state
considered
that
possibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
of
a
new
sentencing,
remanding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
when
the
supreme
court
did
that,
they
were
usurping
the
jury's
function.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
the
state
will
tell
us
about
that
a
little
later.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand
your
point
to
be
that
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
had
to
return
a
40year
sentence,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
he
had
two
prior
felonies?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
i
take
it
your
argument
is
now
that
the
court
was
exercising
a
discretion
which
under
51(a)
could
only
be
exercised
by
a
jury
which
might
have
given
only
a
ten-year
bonus
instead
of
a
twenty-year
bonus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
justice
stevens
is
quite
right,
the
court
didn't
say
this
flatly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
nothing
implicit
in
that.
isn't
there
a
holding
also
that
it
is
not
a
contravention
of
their
own
state
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
could
impose
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
only
one
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
the
supreme
court
has
no
authority
to
fix
it
at
this
20
extra
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
think
the
only
remedy
available
by
the
time
the
appeal
was
argued
in
the
state
supreme
court
was
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court
for
a
new
sentencing
procedure
under
51(a)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
at
the
time
of
the
oral
argument
in
that
court,
the
supreme
court,
there
was
no
valid
sentence
outstanding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
you
to
say
before
that
you
would
be
quite
satisfied
if
the
--
even
if
your
client
were
not,
as
matter
of
law
you
would
be
quite
satisfied
if
this
court
were
to
have
the
case
go
back
down
through
the
supreme
court
to
the
trial
court
for
resentencing
under
the
procedure
of
51(a).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
might
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
avoid
the
enhancement
of
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
my
first
assumption
has
fallen
apart,
hasn't
it,
that
you
would
be
satisfied
if
it
went
back
for
resentencing.
i
thought
you
had
told
me
earlier
that
you
wanted
to
be
resentenced
under
51(a)
in
my
prior
questions
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
never
having
been
decided
in
the
oklahoma
court,
it
would
be
no
question
for
us
to
reach
here,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hypothetically,
if
this
case
went
back,
have
you
suggested
that
the
new
jury
could
give
a
life
sentence
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
do
it,
then
can
this
court,
could
this
court
remand
it
for
resentencing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
remanded
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
contrary
to
your
view
of
the
matter
a
new
jury
could
be
drawn
for
the
sentencing
only,
even
though
that
you
say
has
not
been
done
before,
would
that
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reviewable
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
the
federal
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
said
before
he
could
get
a
life
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn't
get
a
life
sentence
if
he
got
the
same
sentence
he
has
now,
then
would
there
be
any
federal
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
