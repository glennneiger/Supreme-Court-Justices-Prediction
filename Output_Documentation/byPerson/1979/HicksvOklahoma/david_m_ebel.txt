mr.
david
m.
ebel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
sentencing
procedures
case
and
it
raises
important
constitutional
questions
about
the
procedures
that
need
to
be
followed
in
sentencing
defendants.
this
is
not
a
case
that
challenges
inherently
habitual
sentencing
statutes,
and
it
is
not
a
case
that
challenges
the
excessiveness
of
a
40-year
sentence
for
a
person
who
commits
the
kind
of
crimes
that
the
defendants
hicks
has
committed.
rather,
it
is
a
case
that
challenges
the
method
of
imposing
that
sentence
on
him.
hicks
is
a
young
black
man.
he
was
28
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
he
and
his
codefendant
were
convicted
by
a
jury
in
oklahoma
of
a
single
sale
of
heroin
worth
$50.
now,
oklahoma
has
a
peculiar
statute
which
says
that
a
defendant
in
oklahoma
has
a
right
to
be
sentenced
by
a
jury,
and
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
said
that
that
is
a
sacred
right
that
may
not
be
lost
except
by
express
waiver.
now,
because
neither
defendant
here
waived
that
right,
the
jury
was
reconvened
to
sentence
these
two
defendants.
hicks'
codefendant
received
the
minimum
sentence
possible
under
the
heroin
statute,
that
is
five
years.
hicks,
on
the
other
hand,
was
charged
under
the
habitual
criminal
statute
in
oklahoma.
and
i
should
pause
for
a
minute
to
tell
you
that
oklahoma
has
two
habitual
criminal
statutes,
51(a)
and
51(b).
51(b)
is
a
mandatory
statute
and
it
says
that
if
you
have
been
convicted
of
two
prior
felonies,
you
must
be
sentenced
to
the
maximum
term
permissible
under
the
third
offense
plus
an
additional
20
years,
and
that
formula
here
would
calculate
to
a
40-year
sentence
for
hicks.
now,
the
other
statute
is
51(a)
and
that
is
a
discretionary
statute.
that
statute
says
that
if
you
committed
one
or
more
prior
offenses,
that
the
jury
may
sentence
you
to
anything
it
wishes
between
ten
years
and
life.
well,
at
hicks
trial
the
jury
was
given
evidence
of
two
prior
felony
convictions.
hicks
did
not
challenge
that
evidence,
so
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
if
you
find
hicks
as
guilty
of
the
two
prior
felonies,
you
must
find
him
guilty
under
51(b)
and
you
must
sentence
him
to
40
years
in
jail.
the
jury
listened
to
those
instructions
carefully
and
it
followed
them
and
it
returned
a
40-year
mandatory
habitual
criminal
sentence
against
him.
now,
while
that
case
was
pending
on
appeal,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
decided
a
second
case
that
was
called
thigpen
v.
state,
and
in
that
case
the
oklahoma
court
held
that
51(b)
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
your
honor,
i
think
it
rested
on
federal
constitutional
grounds,
although
it
doesn't
say
so
in
the
opinion,
and
my
opinion
that
it
rests
on
federal
grounds
rests
on
the
fact
that
the
appendix
attached
to
the
opinion
is
premised
upon
federal
grounds,
and
it
appears
to
have
been
cited
with
approval
by
the
majority
opinion.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct,
your
honor,
now
it
has
one.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
issue
isn't
directly
before
this
court
because
thigpen
was
not
appealed
here.
at
least
when
hicks
was
sentenced
at
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
i
think
that
thigpen
represented
the
law
as
interpreted
by
oklahoma,
and
so
for
the
case
at
least
of
hicks
we
can
assume
that
51(b)
was
improper.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
no,
i
don't
think
the
statute
is
in
existence
any
more
because
it
has
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
a
final
decision
by
the
state's
highest
court
before
this
case
ever
came
up
here.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct.
i
think
it
might
be
said
to
be
bad
law
today.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
that
once
thigpen
is
final
and
not
appealed,
that
that
statute
is
invalidated
because
the
law
changes,
it
doesn't
spring
back,
all
the
legislation
around
the
country
that
might
have
been
stricken
under
one
interpretation
of
the
law.
i
think
the
legislature
would
clearly
have
to
reenact
the
statute.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
don't
have
any
to
cite
to
you
at
this
time,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
to
be
the
law.
we
cite
in
this
case
both
due
process
and
equal
protection
and
eighth
amendment
arguments.
because
of
the
shortness
of
time,
i
am
going
to
argue
primarily
the
due
process
case
issues
here,
as
i
think
it
is
primarily
a
procedural
case.
our
first
due
process
argument
is
that
hicks
was
denied
due
process
when
he
was
sentenced
in
violation
of
the
state's
own
laws.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
that
oklahoma
has
created
a
right
to
be
sentenced
by
a
jury.
the
oklahoma
statute
926
explicitly
says
so.
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
explicitly
said
that
there
is
such
a
right
and
it
is
sacred.
the
state
in
its
responsive
brief
at
page
24
acknowledges
this
fact
when
it
says,
"although
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
mandate
the
imposition
of
punishment
by
a
jury,
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
statutorily
created
such
a
right."
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
don't
think
you
need
to
reconstitute
the
original
jury,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
statute
simply
requires
a
jury
sentencing.
it
doesn't
say
that
it
has
to
be
the
same
jury,
so
i
think
it
could
be
a
new
jury.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
yes,
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct,
and
51(b)
is
what
has
been
thrown
out
and
which
we
think
is
now
a
final
decision
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
so
unless
it
were
reenacted,
51(a)
is
the
statute
under
which
they
would
have
to
proceed.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
of
reenacting
51(b)?
mr.
david
m.
ebel
your
honor,
there
appears
to
be
no
indication
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
considered
that.
they
just
simply
said
we
are
going
to
impose
a
new
sentence
under
51(a)
because
it
is
not
going
to
prejudice
you,
since
we
are
going
to
issue
the
same
length
of
sentence
as
before.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
absolutely.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
all
right.
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
sentence
here
was
issued
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
rather
than
the
jury
because
the
defendant
hicks
does
come
before
this
court
sentenced
only
under
51(a)
and
the
jury
never
purported
to
issue
any
sentence
under
51(a)
itself,
only
the
court
of
appeals
presumed
to
do
that.
further,
51(a)
requires
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
the
jury
never
presumed
to
exercise
discretion.
in
fact,
it
was
instructed
that
it
could
not
exercise
discretion.
only
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
your
honor,
they
didn't
impose
a
new
length
of
sentence,
they
incorporated
the
old
length
but
they
based
the
sentence
upon
a
different
statute.
and
under
brown
v.
state
in
oklahoma,
and
another
case
that
we
also
cite
in
our
briefs,
as
well
as
the
lang
case
decided
by
this
court,
a
sentence
under
an
unconstitutional
statute
is
void,
is
gone,
there
is
nothing
to
it.
oklahoma
law
says
that.
and
they
have
said
that
51(b)
was
unconstitutional,
so
under
oklahoma's
own
law
the
sentence
under
51(b)
has
disappeared.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
the
oklahoma
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
it
in
essence
does
say
that
because
it
says
that
we
are
going
to
sentence
under
51(a),
it
is
a
different
statutory
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
your
honor
--
i
don't
know
if
it
makes
any
difference,
but
i
just
raise
this
question.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
if
the
jury
was
instructed
it
had
to
return
a
40-year
sentence
if
it
found
that
hicks
had
two
prior
felony
convictions.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
no
dispute.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
the
court
may
not
have
used
the
word
"resentenced,"
but
the
court
has
said
everything
but
that.
the
oklahoma
law,
as
i
said,
which
isn't
disputed,
i
don't
believe,
that
the
sentence
under
51(b)
is
void,
either
there
is
a
new
sentence
imposed
on
hicks
or
he
stands
today
with
no
sentence
at
all,
and
i
am
sure
the
state
isn't
going
to
say
he
stands
with
no
sentence
at
all.
and
if
he
doesn't
stand
under
a
sentence
that
was
valid
under
the
jury,
somebody
has
had
to
put
a
new
sentence
on
him
and
that
somebody
has
to
have
been
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
if
that
is
true,
then
several
things
have
happened
that
have
violated
hicks'
due
process
rights.
first,
this
sentence
was
imposed
by
somebody
other
than
the
jury,
and
we
think
that
that
violates
one
of
oklahoma's
sacred
rights.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
oh,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
the
way
we
read
the
due
process
clause,
a
state
has
to
follow
its
own
procedures
when
substantive
and
substantial
rights
are
involved,
and
if
it
deviates
from
its
own
procedures
in
forms
of
substantive
rights,
that
is
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
no,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
think
if
the
laws
permit
it
and
if
the
appellate
court
gives
the
defendant
notice
and
a
hearing,
then
an
appellate
court
may
impose
sentence.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
think
so.
i
think
the
due
process
clause
says
that
the
law
and
order
applies
to
the
state,
to
the
court
as
well
as
to
the
citizens,
and
if
the
state
and
the
courts
decide
that
every
now
and
then
we
are
just
not
going
to
follow
our
law
because
it
is
more
convenient
for
us
not
to,
the
due
process
clause
doesn't
permit
that.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
the
state
court
here
never
interpreted
926
as
having
been
abrogated
by
any
abilities
that
it
had.
it
never
said
that
its
rights
to
modify
sentences
could
be
used
to
cut
off
a
jury
right.
the
state
court
never
interpreted
the
law
in
that
regard
and
this
court
in
the
retention
doctrine
has
said
that
when
there
is
a
clear
state
statute
it
can
rely
on
that
state
statute
without
looking
to
any
requirement
that
the
state's
highest
court
interpret
that
statute.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
don't
know
of
any
presumption
of
validity,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
due
process
clause
doesn't
have
such
a
presumption,
and
this
court
can
look
at
the
procedures
and
see
if
the
court
has
followed
the
law.
i
don't
know
of
any
law
here
that
gives
a
greater
presumption
to
a
court
that
may
not
be
following
its
own
state
law
than
it
does
to
any
other
state
official
that
may
not
be
following
state
law.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
the
oklahoma
court
didn't
say
that
what
it
was
doing
was
not
inconsistent
with
oklahoma
law.
it
didn't
say
this
is
not
inconsistent
with
your
jury
rights.
it
sais
simply
this
doesn't
prejudice
you,
and
i
am
saying
it
does
prejudice
hicks.
they
are
not
saying
that
oklahoma
law
doesn't
give
hicks
a
jury
right.
they
are
saying
we
can
do
this
because
we
don't
think
it
is
prejudicial
to
you,
and
i
think
it
was
prejudicial
to
hicks.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
if
there
is
such
an
implicit
holding,
then
i
think
state
courts
are
courts
are
virtually
immune
from
any
challenge
that
they
are
not
following
their
own
laws.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
don't
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
think
what
they
said
was
this
may
not
comply
with
all
the
procedural
safeguards
we
have,
but
we
don't
think
it
is
prejudicing
hicks
and
so
why
does
he
care,
because
we
are
going
to
give
him
the
same
length
of
sentence.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
yes,
your
honor.
the
other
one
is
we
think
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
notice
and
hearing
before
you
can
impose
a
sentence
and
that
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
before
anyone
can
impose
a
sentence.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
your
honor
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
the
strongest
syllogism
i
can
argue
on
that
is
that
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
they
said
that
we
are
sentencing
you
--
they
said
you
were
sentenced
under
51(b),
that
is
an
unconstitutional
statute,
but
we
don't
think
you
are
prejudiced
if
we
affirm
a
40-year
sentence
under
51(a).
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
i
think
it
is
a
different
word
but
i
think
it
means
the
same
thing.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that
is
what
oklahoma
law
says.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
what
i
would
argue
on
the
second
point,
your
honor,
is
that
we
think
the
u.s.
constitution
requires
the
defendant
to
have
an
opportunity
for
notice
and
a
hearing
before
a
sentence
can
be
imposed,
and
we
think
that
hicks
here
did
not
have
such
an
opportunity
to
present
any
evidence
on
his
behalf
under
51(a),
and
that
that
violates
the
united
states
constitution
quite
apart
from
any
of
your
readings
of
the
oklahoma
law.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
right,
and
the
oklahoma
court
cases
are
absolutely
explicit
on
that
point,
the
brown
case
and
the
other
one
that
i
cite
in
my
brief.
when
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
faced
hicks
and
said
that
51(b)
was
unconstitutional,
hicks
stood
before
them
without
a
valid
sentence
at
all.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
your
honor,
not
necessarily
under
51(a),
because
our
third
argument
is
that
we
think
51(a)
itself
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
but
at
least
we
would
be
satisfied
if
he
were
resentenced
and
we
think
the
sentence
ought
to
be
conducted
under
the
basic
heroin
statute
rather
than
51(a),
but
at
least
to
be
sentenced.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct,
and
it
would
entitle
him
to
be
punished
somewhere
between
five
years
and
twenty
which
is
the
spread
permitted
under
the
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
your
honor,
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
we
would
be
satisfied
with
resentencing.
we
are
not
asking
to
reopen
the
guilt
phase
of
this
trial,
and
we
think
that
resentencing
could
be
under
a
newly
constituted
jury
and
would
not
need
to
be
under
the
old
jury.
if
i
said
that
we
would
be
satisfied
with
resentencing
under
51(a),
i
misspoke
because
our
third
due
process
argument
is
that
51(a)
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
is
excessively
broad
and
gives
no
standards
and
direction
for
the
jury
in
the
sentencing
process,
and
we
think
therefore
the
proper
sentence
would
be
under
the
heroin
statute.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
it
was
not
presented
before
the
oklahoma
court,
your
honor.
i
think,
however,
that
under
a
variety
of
doctrines
that
this
court
has
articulated
in
the
past,
which
you
are
very
familiar
with,
it
could
be
reached
by
this
court
for
judicial
economy,
that
is
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
i
think
if
this
court
remands
for
sentencing
under
51(a)
and
hicks
gets
his
sentence
under
51(a)
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
if
hicks
then
is
resentenced
under
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
would
say
if
hicks
is
sentenced
under
51(a),
then
we
would
have
to
come
back
before
this
court
to
challenge
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
yes.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
right.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
would
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
i
think
that
the
typical
statute
in
oklahoma
does
not
set
any
standards
for
the
jury,
but
most
of
the
statutes
are
like
the
heroin
statute
with
a
narrow
range
of
five
years
to
twenty,
which
we
think
is
permissible.
and
the
only
statute
that
i
know
of
in
oklahoma
that
allows
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
right.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
your
honor,
i
think
probably
i
don't
have
the
time
to
go
into
those
in
care.
the
equal
protection
argument
that
i
would
assert
primarily
is
that
the
state
has
treated
two
categories
of
people
differently,
those
that
were
originally
sentenced
under
51(a)
and
those
like
hicks
who
were
originally
sentenced
under
51(b)
and
then
resentenced
under
51(a).
mr.
david
m.
ebel
the
only
two
that
clearly
were
not
raised
below
were
our
third
and
fourth
due
process
arguments,
that
is
the
lack
of
standards
in
the
sentence
and
the
failure
of
the
court
to
give
any
reasons
for
its
sentence.
beyond
that,
it
is
a
little
hard
to
tell
exactly
what
was
raised
because
the
constitutional
arguments
asserted
below
just
broadly
speak
about
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
they
did
not
articulate
due
process,
equal
amendment
or
eighth
amendment.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
no.
i
am
court
appointed
by
this
court
to
represent
hicks
here
on
certiorari.
he
was
represented
by
the
public
defender
below
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
and
when
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
sentenced
him
under
51(a),
he
carried
the
case
on
then
pro
se
himself
and
filed
his
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
pro
se
and
was
granted
pro
se.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
unless
it
is
accepted
by
this
court
that
there
is
a
right
to
be
sentenced
by
a
jury
in
oklahoma
and
the
failure
to
observe
that
right
is
itself
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
well,
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
oklahoma
law
is
already
clear
on
that,
and
this
court
can
decide
that
on
the
basis
presented
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
was
that
hicks
wasn't
prejudiced.
and
i
think
this
court
could
say
that
it
was,
he
was
and
it
needs
to
be
sent
back
for
a
jury
to
sentence.
your
honor,
i
see
that
my
light
light
is
thrown
on
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal,
so
i
will
rest.
thank
you.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
three
quick
comments.
i
think,
although
we
could
leave
it
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
decide
whether
they
could
remand
this
to
a
jury
or
not,
i
think
there
is
precedent
for
that.
it
is
a
case
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
epperson
v.
state
case,
where
i
think
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
just
that.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
yes,
sir.
the
second
point
is
our
discussion
about
the
power
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
modify
sentences.
that
has
always
been
interpreted
under
the
oklahoma
law
as
the
power
to
modify
the
length
of
the
sentence
when
it
is
excessive.
obviously,
they
didn't
feel
this
sentence
here
was
excessive.
to
my
knowledge,
that
statute
has
never
authorized
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
modify
the
basis
for
which
the
sentence
was
issued,
to
modify
the
statute
under
which
he
was
tried,
to
change
the
statutory
basis
entirely.
finally,
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
question,
if
mr.
justice
rehnquist
will
review
again
the
petition
for
rehearing,
the
petitioner
here,
specifically
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
your
honor,
did
complain
about
being
sentenced
under
federal
constitutional
grounds
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
did
ask
to
have
that
matter
remanded
for
sentencing
in
accordance
with
state
law.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
they
denied
the
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
david
m.
ebel
no,
but
it
couldn't
have
been
raised
until
the
petitioner
for
rehearing
because
that
is
the
frustration
that
hicks
faces
here,
until
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decided
that
he
was
to
be
sentenced
under
this
new
statute,
the
error
hadn't
occurred.
this
is
unlike
the
case
where
the
error
occurs
at
the
trial
level
and
then
you
can
raise
it
at
the
court
of
appeals.
this
error
didn't
even
occur
until
the
court
of
appeals
handed
down
its
final
decision.
he
couldn't
raise
--
mr.
david
m.
ebel
that
was
the
first
opportunity,
because
we
are
not
claiming
error
at
the
trial,
we
are
claiming
it
at
the
appellate
level.
so
there
was
no
chance
to
raise
it
except
here.
thank
you.
