justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
i
did
not
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
imposing
a
new
sentence.
i
thought
they
affirmed
the
sentence
that
has
been
imposed
mandatorily
before.
they
said
we
must
--
all
they
said,
in
one
sentence,
we
must
find,
however,
that
the
defendant
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
use
of
this
statute
in
that
the
sentence
imposed
is
within
the
range
of
punishment
authorized
by
51(a).
does
that
say
they
have
imposed
the
sentence
themselves?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
don't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
be
right
as
a
matter
of
oklahoma
law,
but
that
is
not
what
their
opinion
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
say
that.
that
is
my
very
point,
it
does
not
say
we
are
going
to
sentence
under
51(a).
it
simply
says
that
the
defendant
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
use
of
this
statute
in
that
the
sentence
imposed
--
and
they
are
referring
to
the
one
imposed
by
the
jury,
as
i
read
it
--
is
within
the
range
authorized
by
51(a).
that
doesn't
say
we're
imposing
a
sentence
under
51(a)
as
i
read
it
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
an
oklahoma
appellate
court
from
time
to
time
says
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
oklahoma
law
in
any
way,
every
now
and
then
we
will
just
sentence
ourselves
when
we
think
the
defendant
deserves
it,
the
state
statute
may
say
something
but
we
will
just
sentence
him
ourselves.
does
that
violate
some
federal
constitutional
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
just
assumes
that
it
isn't
following
its
own
law.
brother
rehnquist
says
and
suggests
to
you
that
the
oklahoma
law
is
what
the
oklahoma
court
says
it
is,
and
if
the
oklahoma
statute
says
jury
sentencing
but
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
says,
well,
from
time
to
time
we
can
sentence
ourselves
in
the
right
circumstances
and
that
this
is
not
inconsistent
with
oklahoma
law,
how
does
that
violate
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
implicit.
you
don't
think
they
said
to
themselves,
oh,
we
are
going
to
do
this
but
we
think
it
violated
the
federal
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
must
have
implicitly
thought
that
it
didn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
here
is
whether
there
is
some
federal
constitutional
right.
you
said
that
you
thought
that
federal
constitutional
rights
were
violated
in
several
respects.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
talking
about
the
state
court,
when
the
issue
hasn't
been
raised
and
passed
on
by
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
a
jurisdictional
question
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
wouldn't
necessarily
remand
for
sentence
under
51(a),
we
would
just
remand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
resentencing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
old
hat,
if
this
particular
federal
constitutional
issue
were
not
raised
in
the
state
court,
if
the
validity
of
that
statute
wasn't
raised
and
passed
on,
i
don't
think
we
can
reach
it
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ebel,
one
of
your
due
process
arguments,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
whoever
fixes
the
sentence,
there
should
have
been
notice
and
an
opportunity
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
to
argue
what
the
sentence
should
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
did
not
receive
that
in
the
trial
court
because
the
jury
was
instructed
that
there
was
a
mandatory
requirement
of
forty
years,
and
he
didn't
receive
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
court
of
appeals
imposed
the
sentence.
now,
if
we
should
accept
that
argument,
would
it
not
be
the
appropriate
relief
simply
to
send
it
back
to
the
oklahoma
court
without
any
instructions
about
jury
sentencing,
because
presumably
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned
the
court
of
appeals
can
do
its
own
sentencing,
as
long
as
they
gave
you
a
fair
opportunity
to
say
that
what
the
sentence
should
be
before
they
simply
affirm
on
the
basis
of
an
invalid
trial
court
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
could
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
could
decide
whether
there
is
such
a
right
in
oklahoma
which
they
would
be
much
better
able
to
decide
than
we
would.
presumably,
if
they
thought
there
was
they
would
follow
their
own
law,
i
think
we
have
to
presume
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
cox,
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
you.
are
you
saying
that
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
or
court
of
criminal
appeals,
whichever
it
was,
in
thigpen
did
not
hold
51(b)
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
did
they
hold
it
to
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
must
accept
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
statute
is
unconstitutional,
is
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
purposes
of
this
case,
it
probably
doesn't
make
any
difference,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
true
regardless
of
the
basis
for
declaring
51(b)
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
isn't
that
what
was
done
here?
if
there
was
no
jury
sentence
and
they
imposed
a
forty-year
sentence,
didn't
they
increase
it
by
forty
years?
and
if
so,
haven't
you
acknowledged
that
the
action
was
improper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
your
view
--
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
theory.
is
it
your
view
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
did
was
affirm
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
where
did
the
defendant
get
his
opportunity
to
have
somebody
decide
how
long
he
should
be
in
jail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
due
process
applies
to
the
sentencing
procedure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
it
was
simply
invalid
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
every
time
a
judge
misinstructs
the
jury
as
to
the
range
of
sentencing,
where
there
is
jury
sentencing
and
he
just
makes
a
mistake,
a
court
of
appeals
decides
that
he
was
erroneously
sentenced,
properly
found
guilty
but
erroneously
sentenced,
there
must
be
a
new
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
almost
follows
from
the
fact
you
have
jury
sentencing
in
your
state.
in
many
states
you
do
not
have
jury
sentencing.
