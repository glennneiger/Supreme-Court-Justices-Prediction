justice
byron
r.
white
then
how
can
you
defend
the
procedure
in
the
trial
court
that
was
followed?
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
he
was
resentenced
before
another
jury
under
different
instructions,
could
he
say
anything
to
the
jury?
the
jury
would
have
the
sentencing
power,
couldn't
he
say
anything
to
the
jury
about
sentencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
good
would
it
have
done
to
present
mitigating
circumstances
when
the
jury
is
told
by
the
judge
you've
got
to
give
him
forty
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
still
waives
his
right
to
do
it,
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
does
the
judge
instruct
the
jury
in
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
is
the
last
--
does
counsel
know
what
the
instructions
are
going
to
be
before
they
argue?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
had
been
absolutely
told
what
his
instruction
was
going
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jury
was
going
to
be
instructed
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
much
of
a
hearing
then
on
sentencing,
is
it?
