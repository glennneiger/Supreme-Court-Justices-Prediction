justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
thigpen
rested
on
state
constitutional
grounds
or
federal
constitutional
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
of
oklahoma?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
thigpen
was
incorrectly,
decided
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
a
certain
abstraction
about
the
whole
thing
perhaps
on
both
sides.
the
oklahoma
legislature
passes
a
statute,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
says
it
is
unconstitutional
on
federal
grounds.
say
this
court
now
were
in
this
particular
proceeding
to
conclude
that
that
conclusion
was
wrong.
the
statute
is
still
in
existence,
it
is
just
two
courts
have
expressed
two
different
opinions
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
constitutional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
this
supposing
that
after
thigpen
had
been
decided
and
after
this
case
had
been
decided
one
way
or
the
other,
this
court
were
to
come
down
with
a
square
ruling
that
indicated
that
made
clear
that
thigpen
was
wrongly
decided
if
it
rested
on
federal
constitutional
grounds,
would
you
then
say
that
oklahoma
legislature
had
to
enact
a
new
statute
rather
than
simply
having
the
old
one
revived?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
involve
a
federal
question,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
if
a
--
do
you
think
it
is
unconstitutional
for
an
appellate
court
to
sentence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
a
state
appellate
court
to
sentence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
state
court's
reading
of
its
own
law
the
final
version
of
it
so
far
as
we
are
concerned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
there
a
presumption
of
validity
to
a
conviction
coming
from
a
state
court
that
the
state
has
at
least
insofar
as
its
own
laws
are
concerned
read
those
laws
as
they
had
to
be
read
because
it
is
the
final
interpreter
of
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
of
these
issues
that
you
are
relying
on
here
did
you
assert
as
constitutional
federal
issues
in
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't
argue
the
case
then
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
disagree
with
your
opposing
counsel
that
thigpen
was
based
on
federal
constitutional
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
due
process
was
there
if
he
had
a
right
to
have
the
jury
decide
between
ten
and
forty
and
the
judge
said
to
the
jury,
you
must
give
him
forty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
cox,
i
suppose
in
any
case
where
the
legislature
has
validly
provided
for
a
mandatory
sentence
upon
conviction
or
habitual
offenders
or
that
sort
of
thing,
the
right
of
allocution,
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
get
up
and
speak
before
the
jury
if
there
is
jury
sentencing
or
before
the
judge
if
there
is
judicial
sentencing,
really
is
a
fantasm
almost
if
the
sentence
has
to
be
mandatory.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
that
is
constitutional,
to
give
a
lot
of
arguments
why
you
shouldn't
be
given
a
mandatory
sentence
that
is
required,
it
isn't
going
to
do
him
any
good.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
the
defendant
to
give
the
jury
or
the
judge
a
lot
of
reasons
why
a
less
than
mandatory
sentence
shouldn't
be
imposed
on
him
isn't
going
to
do
the
defendant
any
good
if
the
legislature
has
said
constitutionally
that
this
mandatory
sentence
shall
be
imposed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
argue
this
case
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
know
any
more
than
mr.
ebel,
i
take
it,
except
from
briefs
what
were
raised
as
federal
constitutional
issues?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you
have
agreed
with
your
friend
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
oklahoma
could
have
remanded
that
case
for
resentencing
by
a
new
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
whether
they
considered
it
or
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
was
the
first
opportunity.
