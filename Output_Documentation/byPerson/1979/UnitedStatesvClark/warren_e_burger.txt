chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
united
states
against
clark.
mrs.
shapiro,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
never
lived
with
the
father,
but
he
arranged
for
them
to
be
somewhere
else
and
paid
for
all
their
living?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
support
factor
vanishes
under
that
language?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
the
contrary,
if
the
man
can
show
canceled
checks
over
the
period
of
10
years,
tax
deduction
every
year
for
support,
then
that
would
be
pretty
good
evidence,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
support
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
distinguished
from
the
“lived
with”
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
theoretically,
they
could
live
with
the
father
without
receiving
any
support
from
whom
with
a
grandmother
paying
the
father
for
all
their
care?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
whether
or
not
they
are
in
fact
supported?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
isn’t
finely-tuned
with
respect
to
this
one
category
of
children,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
the
situation
of
an
illegitimate
child
whose
father
having
acknowledged
as
here
was
a
military
officer
or
foreign
service
officer
moving
from
one
place
to
another
all
over
the
world,
and
so
he
arrange
to
have
the
children
and
when
they
were
in
there
teens
for
example
to
be
in
private
schools
in
the
school
year
and
summer
camps
in
the
summer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
not
consistent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
not
consistent
with
the
answer
you
gave
me
earlier.
you
said
in
the
hypothetical
case
of
the
man
who
paid
their
support,
but
had
to
move
somewhere,
there
would
be
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
whether
there
are
any
administrative
decisions
that
would
be
consistent
with
your
answer
in
these
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
got
the
impression
from
your
earlier
discussion
that
“lived
with”
meant
precise
to
that
lived
with
in
the
normal,
i
thought
you
said
normal
and
ordinary
parent-child
relationship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
people
in
these
hypothetical
situations
where
treated
that
way,
then
they
are
making
an
individualized
judgment
and
not
a
rigid
categorical
judgment?
if
they’re
going
behind
the
“lived
with”
requirement
and
considering
the
evidence
that
the
father
is
really
paying
for
their
support,
but
doesn’t
want
to
maintain
or
can’t
maintain
a
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
familial
home.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let’s
say,
living
with
his
grandmother
and
that
the
father
is
paying
abundantly
for
support.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
exactly
what
i
have
told
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assume
a
three-judge
courts
perhaps
all
of
them,
i
am
not
sure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
hypothesis
responding
to
mr.
justice
white,
the
only
remedy
then
to
enforce
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
would
be
to
get
a
private
bill
in
the
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
times,
the
court
of
claims
in
--
not
in
these
situations,
but
in
some
where
back
payments
were
involved,
having
their
opinions
recommended
that
the
congress
make
up
an
active
private
bill,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
established
as
an
arm
of
congress,
of
course,
originally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
merrigan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
would
you
say
that
he
was
doing
what
was
suggested
in
some
of
the
hypothetical
questions
that
is
he
was
providing
support
for
them
without
providing
a
familial
home
for
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
doesn’t
that
mean
they
were
adopting
the
gentry
approach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
need
a
broad
holding
here
to
support
your
position.
all
you
need
is
that
a
child
who
has
been
legally
recognized
by
a
court
here
finding
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
78-1513,
united
states
against
clark
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
