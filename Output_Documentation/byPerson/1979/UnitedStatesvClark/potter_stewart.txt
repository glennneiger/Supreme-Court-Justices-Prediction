stewart
ever,
ever?
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
implication,
i
suppose
they
did
it
here,
didn’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
they
wouldn’t
have
held
it
unconstitutional
if
they
construed
the
statute
as
in
the
ways
suggested
by
my
brother
stevens'
question?
justice
potter
stewart
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
constitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
they
wouldn’t
certainly
logic
wouldn’t
have
held
it
unconstitutional
had
they
construed
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
way?
justice
potter
stewart
because
jurisdiction
is
for
claims
for
money
based
upon
the
constitutionary
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
court
would
have
the
alternative
of
say,
of
enjoining
any
payments
to
any
children
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
that
alternative
was
illustrated
on
the
case
last
term
in
which
justice
powell
disagreed
with
the
holding
of
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
difference
in
opinion
between
you
is
that
the
“lived
with”
has
to
be
at
the
time
of
the
death?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
government
said,
or
did
it
say
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn’t
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
have
i
directly
identified
the
difference
of
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
by
the
court
of
claims?
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
they
have
held
it
unconstitutional,
had
they
not
construed
it
the
way
the
government
does?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
there
is
no
long
discussion
on
it,
but
as
a
matter
of
logic,
how
could
they
have
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
but
you’re
not
arguing
that
your
clients
can
meet
the
“lived
with”
requirement?
justice
potter
stewart
she
has
to
prove
the
father
acknowledge
the
child?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
she
does
have
to
prove
that
the
child
or
children
were
the
father
--
the
issue
of
the
father.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say
that
can
be
proved
by
her
perjury?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
need
a
track
on
it.
that’s
not
the
act
of
congress
legislated?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
because
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
on
the
constitution
that
entitles
your
plans
to
prepayment
of
any
kind,
for
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
as
enactment?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
merrigan,
you
have
not
addressed
orally,
unless
i
missed
it
to
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
the
back
payments.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
what
sovereign
immunity
means.
you
have
no
where
to
go
if
the
only
person
who
would
otherwise
be
liable
to
you
is
the
sovereign
and
he
inserts
his
immunity,
that
is
exactly
what
sovereign
immunity
means?
justice
potter
stewart
this
lawsuit
wasn't
brought
as
a
class
action?
justice
potter
stewart
always
an
individual
action.
