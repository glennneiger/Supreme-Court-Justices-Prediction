the
commission
interpret
the
act
as
passed
by
congress
or
just
make
recommendations
for
changing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
all
we’re
dealing
with
is
children
under
18
years
of
age
here,
are
we
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
the
question
about
30-year-old
child
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
who
might
have
lived
with
for
18
years
and
then
simply
became
emancipated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
shapiro,
we
have
had
a
number
of
cases
you
can
almost
learn
who
has
been
secretary
of
hew
from
the
case
as
weinberger,
matthews,
califano,
etcetera
and
many
of
them
have
involved
challenges
to
congressional
limitations
on
payments
to
illegitimate
children.
have
any
of
them
up
to
now
ever
been
brought
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
father
had
lived
with
the
child
for
the
first
three
months
of
its
life
and
then
not
lived
with
it
for
the
subsequent
17
years,
nine
months
of
its
life
and
the
child
was
18
at
the
time
of
the
father’s
death?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
isn't
that
just
why
congress
has
to
draw
a
line?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
were
the
--
no
one
has
any
claim
under
an
amendment
that
is
proposed
in
congress
today,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
any
federal
court
has
the
authority
to
reach
a
constitutional
issue
without
first
passing
on
a
necessarily
included
statutory
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
she
would
have
to
perjure
herself
both
as
to
the
question
whether
the
father
was
the
actual
father
and
as
to
whether
he
recognized
the
child.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
presumably,
there
are
an
of
a
lot
of
lawsuits
you
can
imagine
that
could
go
of
on
an
unjust
result
as
a
result
of
perjury
which
wasn't
detected
by
the
finder
of
fact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
founded
on
the
constitution
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
constitution
would
require
the
treasury
to
draw
a
check
to
your
clients
without
any
act
of
congress
in
establishing
a
social
security
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
you
say,
this
is
a
claim
founded
on
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
they
had
declared
that
it
was
unconstitutional
in
order
to
get
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if,
well
but
apart
--
this
is
a
large
statute.
they
had
to
declare
one
section
of
the
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
section
of
the
statute
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
of
which
there
was
bore
on
your
client’s
rights.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
claims
certainly
has
had
a
propensity
throughout
its
life
to
try
to
expand
its
jurisdiction,
hasn’t
it?
