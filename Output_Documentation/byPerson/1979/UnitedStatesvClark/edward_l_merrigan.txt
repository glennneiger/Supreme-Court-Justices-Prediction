mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
just
a
brief
word
about
the
facts
your
honors,
and
i
think
the
court
fully
understands
this
case
from
the
questions
such
you
propounded
to
the
government.
the
two
federal
employees
involved
in
this
case,
one
was
the
father,
mr.
isaacson;
the
other
was
the
lady
involved,
ms.
patricia
aileen
clark,
both
worked
for
the
veterans
administration
at
fort
harrison,
montana
and
they
commenced
to
live
together
in
1965
and
early
1966.
and
during
the
period
of
time
they
lived
together,
they
had
two
children,
shawn
clark
and
tricia
clark
and
they
continued
to
live
together
with
the
children
in
a
regular
husband-wife,
parent-child
relationship
for
the
world
to
know,
through
1971.
in
1971,
mr.
isaacson
moved
out
of
the
common
dwelling
and
mrs.
clark
brought
a
paternity
action
in
the
court
in
montana.
mr.
isaacson
while
alive
appeared
in
that
case,
was
represented
by
counsel.
the
court
entered
a
paternity
order
against
mr.
isaacson
which
specifically
declared
him
to
be
the
father
of
these
two
children.
then
by
stipulation
and
judgment
of
the
court,
he
was
ordered
to
pay
$5,000.00
representing
the
back
support
payments
he
owed
the
children
for
the
time
he
had
moved
out
of
the
house.
he
then
stipulated
and
was
ordered
by
the
court
to
$120.00
a
month
for
their
future
support.
he
then
stipulated
and
was
ordered
by
the
court
to
make
them
the
beneficiaries
of
two
life
insurance
policies,
one
in
new
york
life
insurance
company
policy
and
the
other
is
federal
government
employees
group
policy.
he
made
all
of
the
support
payments
to
the
children
forward
to
his
death
not
directly,
but
by
deductions
or
allotments
out
of
his
federal
salary
up
to
the
time
of
his
death
in
1974
in
an
automobile
accident.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
he
did
everything
for
the
children
except
to
[attempt
to
laughter]
marry
the
mother
and
continued
to
actually
live
with
them
physically
until
the
date
of
his
death
from
about
1972
to
1974.
he
was
a
father
in
every
sense
of
the
word
by
court
order,
by
support
payments,
by
living
with
them
for
long
period
of
time
and
the
government
in
this
case
in
its
reply
brief
concedes
that
there
is
no
need
under
the
“lived
with”
requirement
of
the
statute
for
a
permanent
“living
with.”
the
government
concedes
that
it
can
be
a
temporary
or
a
periodic
separation
in
that
relationship
without
breaking
the
chain
supposedly.
this
has
never
been
judicially
declared,
but
the
government
concedes
it
in
its
reply
brief.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
i
think
if
you
construe
the
statute
itself
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
construe
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that’s
the
difference.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
when
we
sued
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
specifically
asked
the
court
to
award
a
judgment
here
based
on
an
act
of
congress
with
the
“lived
with”
requirement
in
the
law
because
we
say
that
it
says
“lived
with”,
it
does
not
say
“live
with”
or
“living
with”
in
the
statute.
it
says
“lived
with”
and
here
the
court
and
the
government
and
everybody
involved
concedes
that
they
lived
with
and
that
there
was
that
[attempt
to
laughter]
open
to
the
word
“lived
with”
in
the
past.
i
think
that
the
problem
that
we
run
into
in
this
case
is
the
construction
given
to
the
statute
by
the
civil
service
commission
which
says
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
not
really
by
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
i
think
that
the
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional
in
gentry.
there
is
no
long
discussion
of
the
constitutionality
in
our
case
because
they
simply
adopt
the
gentry.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
they
simply
held
that
the
“lived
with”
requirement,
as
i
am
trying
to
point,
your
honor,
in
a
moment,
is
simply
a
total
bar
to
any
recovery
for
illegitimates
in
90%
of
the
cases
by
the
very
term
illegitimate,
[attempt
to
laughter]
meaning
that
the
father
and
mother
are
not
married.
in
more
than
90%
of
the
cases,
the
father
is
either
married
to
somebody
else,
or
he
is
a
bachelor
who
does
not
want
to
marry
the
mother
and
is
therefore
living
somewhere
else
and
so
if
you
can’t
meet
the
“lived
with”
requirement
with
the
father,
are
you
totally
barred
from
benefits
at
all?
so
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
we
say
that
in
this
case,
truly,
jurisdiction
in
this
case
i
think,
this
case
should
be
settled
in
our
judgment
if
we
can
propose
to
the
court
that
if
you
looked
at
the
statute
and
construed
that
they
had
lived
with
for
the
period
of
time
that
we
just
referred
to,
that
there
was
the
support,
that
they
did
meet
the
requirement
of
the
statute,
and
therefore,
the
court
of
claims
clearly
had
jurisdiction
because
we
are
suing
on
an
act
of
congress
where
including
the
“lived
with”
requirement
and
therefore
they
are
entitled
to
judgment
on
this
28
u.s.c.
1491.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
say
that
this
court
could
if
it
wanted
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
in
this
case
say
that
the
statute
properly
construed,
should
have
grant
a
judgment
here
without
reaching
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
when
you
start
these
types
of
requirements
in
the
statute,
obviously,
as
you
change
the
facts,
it
gets
even
worse,
it
gets
better.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
congress
did
not
draw
the
line
at
“lived
with”
or
“living
with”.
the
amendment
that
is
now
proposed
in
congress
today
talks
in
terms
of
living
with
meaning
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
do
not
say
that
we
are
relying
on
the
amendment
that
is
proposed
today.
the
statute
today
speaks
in
terms
of
“lived
with.”
the
amendment
proposed
in
congress
today
is
talking
in
terms
of
“living
with”
meaning
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
“living
with,”
i
think
they
have
changed
the
act
of
congress.
and
what
i
am
trying
to
say
to
you,
your
honors,
is
that
if
we
wanted
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case,
as
we
originally
sued
in
our
petition
of
the
court
of
claims,
is
that
these
children,
truly
in
this
case,
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
and
if
that
be
true,
everything
that
mrs.
shapiro
said
this
morning
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
automatically
falls
because
we
are
suing
on
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not
because
the
children
never
lived
with
their
parent
in
gentry.
what
happened
is
by
the
time
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
the
court
of
claims
did
not
pass
on
it,
your
honor.
what
happened
is,
we
moved
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
what
i
think
happened
in
our
case,
your
honor,
is
this.
between
the
time
we
filed
our
petition
in
the
court
of
claims
and
the
time
they
rendered
summary
judgment,
this
statute
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
five
times.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
think
in
this
case,
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
judgment
in
this
case,
which
is
of
course
in
the
appendix,
what
happened
is
the
court
of
claims
had
previously
ruled
a
“lived
with”
provision
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
therefore,
rather
than
reach
--
rather
than
re-construe
or
apply
the
provision
in
our
case,
they
deemed
it
to
have
been
declared
unconstitutional
in
the
past.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
think
they
–
there’s
no
question
but
that
the
court
of
claims
in
our
case
ruled
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
i
am
suggesting
too,
your
honors,
that
we
have
been
swept
under
the
facts
of
this
case
if
you
construed
the
statute
to
mean
“lived
with”
to
cover
the
facts
of
our
case,
that
we
meet
the
terms
of
the
statute
without
the
constitutional
issue
being
raised.
and
if
that
be
true,
there’s
no
question,
but
that
the
court
of
claims
had
jurisdiction
under
28
u.s.c.
1491.
there’s
no
question
that
this
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
under
1252
of
title
28
because
of
course,
there
is
no
constitutional
issue
raised
if
you
would
decide
this
case
on
that
basis.
but
i
am
not
trying
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
because
when
you
move
on
to
that
issue
in
this
case,
the
“lived
with”
requirement
which
is
the
only
test
as
to
whether
or
not
an
illegitimate
child
can
recover
for
all
practical
purposes
is
a
total
bar
to
almost
all
illegitimates
because
what
it
means
in
most
cases
is
an
illegitimate
child
is
the
child
of
a
mother
and
father
who
are
not
married,
in
more
than
90%
of
the
cases
do
not
live
together.
under
the
laws
of
most
states,
the
mother
has
custody
of
the
child.
in
most
cases,
the
father
is
either
living
with
another
wife
or
living
as
a
bachelor
who
does
not
want
to
live
with
the
other
woman
who
had
the
child
and
so
the
poor
child
is
left
[laughter
attempt]
without
a
father,
without
the
ability
to
lived
with,
without
the
ability
to
meet
the
test
in
any
circumstance.
so,
by
making
the
“lived
with”
requirement
alone,
the
test
is
the
equivalent
of
striking
most
illegitimates’
ability
to
recover
under
the
statute
at
all
and
i
think
that
is
what
made
five
courts
in
the
federal
system,
two
of
them
three-judge
courts
declare
the
statute
uniformly
unconstitutional.
some
of
the
questions,
your
honors
have
asked,
make
it
clear.
a
federal
employee
for
example
who
did
want
to
live
with
the
child,
who
is
assigned
to
saudi
arabia
in
his
government
job,
would
be
over
there,
the
child
would
be
here
with
the
mother,
not
eligible.
a
government
employee
who
has
no
home,
who
travels
all
the
time,
the
child
lives
with
the
mother,
no
ability
for
the
child
to
recover
the
benefits.
in
other
cases,
where
the
parents
lived
together
for
a
long
period
of
time,
10
years,
12
years,
and
then
the
father
suddenly
moves
out
in
spat
with
the
mother,
no
ability
for
the
child
to
recover
because
he
can’t
show
he
was
physically
living
with
the
child
at
the
moment
of
death.
now,
the
government
says,
children
can
protect
themselves
against
that,
that
they
can
insist
that
they
lived
with
the
father.
well,
here
is
a
three-year
old
child,
a
six-year
old
child.
“mother,
i
insist
on
living
with
my
father
to
protect
my
federal
annuity”
or
“father,
i
insist
on
you
letting
me
move
in
with
you
to
protect
my
federal
annuity.”
that’s
what
the
government
is
asking
us
to
do
in
this
case.
your
honors,
as
far
as
the
statute
itself
is
clearly
enacted
by
congress
to
protect
dependents
who
are
looking
to
the
deceased
employee
for
support.
in
this
case,
we
have
the
order
of
a
montana
court
decreeing
support.
we
have
the
support
being
made
throughout
the
employee’s
life
right
up
to
his
death
through
allotments
out
of
his
federal
salary.
so,
there
is
no
guess
work
on
the
part
of
the
government
as
to
whether
he
was
supporting
the
children,
it
came
from
his
salary.
then
we
have
the
father
in
the
life
insurance
policy,
the
federal
group
life
insurance
policy
paying
after
death
for
the
support
of
the
children
and
yet
they
have
been
denied
the
benefits
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
they
simply
did
not
physically
lived
with
him
at
the
moment
of
death.
the
government
says,
perhaps
spurious
claims
are
prevented
by
this
sort
of
a
statute.
well,
let’s
take
the
case
that
is
so
well-known
today
of
young
women
moving
in
with
a
federal
employee,
let's
say,
bringing
in
a
small
child
that
she
had
from
some
other
relationship
and
then
the
federal
employee
dies,
so
the
mother
says,
“chance
for
our
federal
annuity.”
this
child
was
the
federal
employee’s
child.
we
were
living
with
him
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
therefore,
i
want
the
annuity.
under
the
statute,
that
is
all
she'd
have
to
say,
if
she
is
willing
to
lie
because
then
she
could
show
they
were
living
together
in
regular
parent-child
relationship.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no.
not
under
the
statute.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
the
children
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
it
could
be
proved
spuriously.
that’s
the
only
suggestion
i
am
making,
your
honor.
i
am
not
trying
to
say
that
this
sort
of
claim
should
be
set-up
but
i
think
the
statute
promotes
it.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
recognized,
right.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
the
woman
could
recover
on
other
grants
because
adopted
children
or
stepchildren
could
be
included
in
the
same
“lived
with”
requirement.
but
i
say
--
all
i
am
trying
to
say,
your
honor,
is
it
opens
the
door
for
spurious
claims
on
the
ground
that
children
that
were
not
really
the
children
of
that
particular
father
were
living
with
him
at
the
time
of
death
and
the
mother
then
can
fabricate
a
claim
around
it.
all
i
am
trying
to
say
is
--
i
am
not
trying
to
say
this
should
be
allowed,
i
am
not
trying
to
say
that
that
spurious
claim
is
a
sound
claim,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
this
particular
type
of
statute
promotes
that
particular
type
of
claim.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
raised
the
possibility
only
because
one
of
the
defenses
for
this
statute
is
that
it
was
enacted
to
protect
the
government
rather
against
spurious
claims.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no
question,
your
honor,
no
question.
i
think
we
fit
in
this
particular
case
every
requirement
that
could
possibly
be
made
for
an
illegitimate
child.
there
was
the
living
together.
there
was
the
parent-child
relationship.
there
was
the
decree
of
the
montana
court
and
there
was
the
support
payments
not
only
through
death,
but
after
death
through
the
insurance.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
truly
don’t
know
that,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
it’s
rather
important.
i
would
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
the
word
recognition,
of
course,
i
think
is
clear
cut
in
any
case
where
you
have
an
order
affiliation.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
such
as
you
have
in
montana.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
want
you
to
understand,
your
honor,
that
that
idea
did
not
only
originated
with
me.
it
was
discussed
in
proctor
decision,
it
was
discussed
in
the
gentry
decision
that
this
thing
could
happen.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
certainly,
there
should
be
it.
when
there
is
a
court
order
that
there
can
be
further
doubt.
i
think
the
other
thing
is
that
showing
of
actual
support
that
he
contributed
to
support
and
what
the
government
is
now
proposing
to
congress,
and
it
is
already
passed
the
house
and
is
well
along
in
the
senate
is
that
there
be
a
“living
with”
as
opposed
to
“lived
with”
and
that
there
be
a
showing
that
he
contributed
to
the
support
of
the
child
prior
to
death.
i
suggest
to
you
that
that’s
going
to
require
a
rather
case-by-case
determination.
it
is
not
exactly
the
uniform
presentation
that
would
usually
be
required
under
these
other
statutes.
so,
your
honors,
where
i
think
we
find
ourselves
in
this
case
is
this.
here
we
have
five
federal
courts
in
the
past
that
have
uniformly
held
the
present
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
and
as
a
result,
all
of
the
children
in
those
cases
are
now
recognized
to
receive
their
benefits
under
the
statute.
on
the
right,
we
have
the
agency
itself
seeking
an
amendment
to
the
law
that
will
protect
all
children
in
the
future
that
may
be
the
law
before
this
court
acts
in
this
case.
so,
we
find
ourselves
right
in
the
middle
of
the
law
as
it
has
been
interpreted
by
other
federal
courts
uniformly
in
the
past
and
as
congress
is
changing
it
in
the
future.
and
we
urge
this
court
for
all
of
the
reasons
i
have
stated,
either
to
uphold
the
court
of
claims
decision
on
the
constitutional
issue
or
to
construe
this
statute
or
and
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
to
say
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
has
conceded
on
the
record
by
the
government,
these
children
would
be
entitled
to
judgment
under
the
statute,
even
with
the
unconstitutional
provision
in
it.
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
just
briefly,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
court
of
claims
under
section
1491
of
title
28
has
clear
cut
jurisdiction
over
any
claim
based
on
an
act
of
congress.
it
has
clear
cut
jurisdiction
on
any
claim
based
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
what
the
court
of
claims
rule
in
gentry
is
that
this
particular
provision
is
a
relatively
minor
provision
of
the
statute
which
was
enacted
by
congress
to
provide
support
to
children
of
the
deceased
federal
employees.
it
was
severable
provision,
it
severed
that
provision,
and
with
that
severed
provision
out,
then
it
granted
judgment
based
on
that
act
of
congress
and
i
urge
the
court
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
your
honor,
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
to
render
judgments
on
the
constitution
as
well
as
on
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
the
claim
based
on
the
constitution
here
would
be
that
they
are
entitled
to
judgment
[attempt
to
laughter]
under
the
statute
as
interpreted
in
the
court
on
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
i
don't
think
that’s
true
at
all,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
say
that
this
is
a
claim
founded
on
the
act
of
congress
with
the
power
of
the
court
of
claims
to
sever
an
unconstitutional
provision
from
that
statute.
in
the
testan
case,
for
example,
your
honor
which
is
the
case
that
was
referred
to
by
mrs.
shapiro,
in
that
case,
there
was
a
claim
by
federal
employees
that
they
had
been
misclassified
by
the
civil
service
commission.
moreover,
there
was
no
statute
that
gave
them
any
right
of
recovery
based
on
the
misclassification
of
position,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
statute.
here
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
is
firmly
grounded
on
the
very
statute
congress
passed.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
not
the
whole
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
they
declared
a
tiny
sentence
in
this
statute.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
a
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that’s
correct,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
say
to
you,
your
honor,
then
that
they
then
pegged
their
decision
very
firmly
on
an
act
of
congress
with
the
voided
provision
out
of
it.
and
i
think
that
they
do
have
the
right
because
they
do
have
the
power
to
consider
a
claim
based
on
the
constitution
as
well
as
acts
of
congress
to
look
at
an
act
of
congress,
to
declare
a
section
which
is
clearly
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
void
and
then
to
grant
a
judgment
against
the
united
states
founded
on
that
act
of
congress.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that
is
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
think
the
court
of
claims
did
cite
some
authorities
[attempt
to
laughter]
to
that
effect,
although
it
escapes
my
mind
at
the
moment.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
i
hope
we
won’t
find
this
case
as
the
limiting
factor
on
that
propensity
but
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
do
recall
it,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
we
relied
on
gentry
totally,
as
well
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
skelton.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
we
did.
we
relied
totally
on
the
gentry
decision
and
in
fact,
i
think
what
happened
in
our
case
is
the
court
of
claims
looking
at
five
straight
federal
decisions
on
the
subject
did
not
reach
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
we
urged
on
it.
it
simply
ruled
on
the
constitutional
issue.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
your
honor,
clearly,
the
statute
itself
provides
for
payments
from
the
moment
of
death
of
the
federal
employee.
the
act
was
passed
for
that
purpose.
the
congress
intended
the
act
for
that
purpose.
there
was
no
withholding
of
sovereign
immunity
on
the
liability
of
the
federal
government
for
such
payments
and
the
only
way
that
sovereign
immunity
comes
into
this
is
a
claim
that
like
in
testan
where
there
was
no
statute
at
all,
therefore,
there
is
sovereign
immunity
claim
of
no
ability
of
the
court
of
claims
to
judge
it.
what
we
are
trying
to
say
here
is
that
the
provision
was
severable.
there
is
an
act
of
congress.
there
is
a
direction
of
the
congress
that
they
be
paid
back
to
the
date
of
death.
can
you
imagine,
construing
this
--
the
law
in
such
a
fashion
that
we
have
nowhere
to
go
to
collect
a
true
debt
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
and
that
usually
arises
in
the
case
where
there
is
no
statute
passed
by
the
congress
authorizing
the
payment
of
the
debt
of
the
united
states
and
here,
there
is
a
clear
cut
debt
of
the
united
states
running
back
to
the
very
day
that
the
employee
died.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
i
think
that’s
generally
correct
and
by
the
way
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
that
would
be
it.
and
by
the
way,
with
that
your
honor,
we
would
then
be
scooped
into
a
class
if
i
don’t
know
how
many
employees,
some
of
whom
have
completely
different
positions
than
we
have
on
all
of
the
facts.
in
other
words,
here
we
have
a
showing
of
support.
we
have
a
showing
of
“lived
with”
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
a
class
would
be
so
general
that
we
may
fall
with
the
class.
and
even
under
the
new
[laughter
attempt]
statute,
we
may
somehow
fall
with
the
class
and
so,
i
think
that
the
gentry
decision
is
a
sound
decision.
i
think
it
treated
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
treated
the
question
of
the
court’s
jurisdiction
correctly
and
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
us.
and
i
think
what
we
are
really
here
about
is
an
appeal
from
gentry
which
the
government
never
took.
the
government
never
took
any
appeal
from
any
of
the
other
decisions
in
the
past
up
to
this
one.
and
i
think
that
we
are
now
trying
to
carry
on
our
shoulders
all
of
the
claims
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
go
the
all
way
back
to
gentry.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
always
an
individual
action.
thank
you
very
much.
