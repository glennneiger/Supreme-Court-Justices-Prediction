what
about
legitimate
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suggest
the
congress
is
attempting
to
do
to
avoid
that
the
problems
of
the
proof
in
individual
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
generality,
but,
so
the
only
advantage
was
to
avoid
individualizing
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there’s
the
4%.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
just
don’t
think
that
it
is
necessary
in
legitimacy
cases
to
individualize?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
--
say
that
there
is
an
acknowledged
illegitimate
child
living
with
the
father
at
the
time
of
his
death,
but
he
has
been
supporting
the
child,
does
that
--
is
that
--
would
that
be
construed
to
be
a
regular
parent-child
relationship?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
is
not
supporting
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
just
living
with
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
is
not
supporting
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
regular
parent-child
relationship.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
must
assume
--
so
it
is
not
open
to
the
government
to
deny
benefits
on
the
ground
that
the
father
isn’t
actually
supporting
the
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
answering
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
what
remedy
would
be
available
in
district
court,
you
said,
the
court
would
have
a
choice
and
it
could
order
the
payment
of
benefits,
how
about
back
benefits?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
but
you
say
that
even
if
the
district
court
decided
that
you’ve
been
incorrectly
construing
the
act
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
that
you
should
have
been
paying
these
benefits
the
entire
time.
the
district
court
could
not
enter
a
judgment
for
past
benefits.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
as
you
construed
the
act,
congress
has
not
waived
sovereign
immunity
to
that
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
authority
for
that?
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact
that
the
court
of
claims
disagrees
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
seeking
the
support
of
judgment
on
a
different
ground
than
the
court
of
claims
gave
you
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
agency
construction
is
of
the
present
language
is
“living
with?”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wasn't
your
--
wasn't
--
did
the
court
of
claims
reject
your
construction
of
the
statute
in
gentry?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
weren’t
in
gentry
but
was
that
issue
before
you
were
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
of
claims,
in
affect
then
in
this
case,
rejected
your
statutory
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
you
think
it
didn’t
enter
a
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
way
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
court
of
claims’
argument
in
gentry?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
being
able
to
say
in
any
prior
authority
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
may
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
recall
judge
skelton’s
concurring
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
present
that
position
in
your
case
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
said,
not
only
should
the
statute
be
construed
to
award
benefits
when
the
“living
with”
had
occurred
any
time,
but
you
have
also
argued
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
permit
proof
of
support
in
any
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
because
the
court
of
claims
apparently
rejected
that
position
in
gentry,
but
you
represented
it
--
you
presented
it
in
your
case
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
otherwise,
the
government
will
come
in
and
say,
“of
course,
you
are
within
the
class
that
was
intended
to
be
benefited
by
the
statute
and
we
owe
you
the
money,
but
you
just
cannot
sue
for
it.”
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
would
be
the
position.
