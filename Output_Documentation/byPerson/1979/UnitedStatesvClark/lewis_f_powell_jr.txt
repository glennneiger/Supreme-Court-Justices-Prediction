justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
does
the
commission
construe
the
word
“recognized?”
does
it
require
some
formal
act
of
recognition
by
the
father
or
by
court?
how
does
it
construe
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
all
of
these
hypotheticals
you
give,
the
recognition
is
rather
important,
isn’t
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
an
easy
case,
but
you
have
been
arguing
with
a
rather
broad
brush,
i
suggest?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it’s
clear
cut
here,
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
but
this
example
you
gave
of
moving
in
and
dying,
and
the
wife
coming
along
and
saying
what
you
say
he
said?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
all
you
are
saying
today
is
that
there
must
be
a
court
order,
so
far
as
you
are
concerned?
