justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
question
presented
is
whether
illegitimate
children
of
a
federal
civil
service
employee
are
entitled
to
survivors
benefits
under
the
civil
service
retirement
act
when
the
children
once
have
lived
with
the
employee
in
a
family
relationship
or
not
living
with
the
employee
at
the
time
of
his
death.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
such
children
may
recover
these
benefits.
appellee
is
a
mother
of
two
illegitimate
children
fathered
by
a
federal
employee
covered
by
the
civil
service
retirement
act.
the
children
born
in
1968
and
1971
respectively
lived
as
a
family
with
the
appellee
and
the
civil
service
employee
through
1971,
at
which
time
the
appellee
and
the
children
began
living
apart
from
the
employee.
after
employee's
death
in
1974,
the
appellee
applied
for
survivor's
benefit
for
the
children
under
the
act.
and
under
that
act,
all
legitimate
and
adopted
children
under
18
years
of
age
qualify
for
such
benefits
but
step-children
and
recognized
neutral
children
under
18,
may
recover
only
if
they
lived
with
the
employee
in
regular
parent-child
relationship.
the
civil
service
commission's
bureau
of
retirement,
insurance
and
occupational
health
denied
the
appellee's
application
holding
that
the
act
bars
recovery
of
survivor's
benefits
for
illegitimate
children
who
are
not
living
with
the
employee
at
the
time
of
his
death.
the
commission's
board
of
appeals
and
review
affirmed.
appellee
then
filed
this
action
in
the
court
of
claims
alleging
that
the
acts
lived
with
requirement
was
met
in
this
case
because
their
children
had
once
lived
with
their
father
in
a
family
relationship.
alternatively,
she
contended
that
the
act
violate
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment
if
it
allowed
recovery
only
for
illegitimate
children
who
lived
with
the
government
employee
at
the
time
of
his
death.
the
court
of
claims
granted
appellee's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
ignoring
the
statutory,
a
contention
the
court
held
that
the
acts
lived
with
requirement
unconstitutionally
discriminated
against
illegitimate
children.
it
is
well
settled
that
this
court
will
not
pass
on
the
constitutional
act
of
congress
that
the
reconstruction
of
that
act
is
fairly
possibly
by
which
a
question
may
be
avoided.
in
this
case,
we
decline
to
reach
the
constitutional
contention
raised
by
appellee.
rather,
we
hold
that
the
acts
lived
with
requirement
should
be
construed
as
allowing
recovery
for
illegitimate
children
once
lived
with
the
employee
in
a
family
relationship
but
were
not
living
with
the
employee
at
the
time
of
death.
that
construction
is
fair
and
reasonable
in
light
of
the
language,
purpose
and
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
is
necessary
to
avoid
the
serious
constitutional
issues
raised
by
the
appellee.

that
effect.
