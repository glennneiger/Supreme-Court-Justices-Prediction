justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
say
that
though,
haven’t
they
proposed
the
elimination
of
the
“lived
with”
requirement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
doesn’t
that
come
from
the
commission?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
what
bothers
me
is
your
use
of
the
word
“consistent”
because
if
the
commission
in
now
behind
this
proposed
legislation,
they’re
receding
from
what
may
have
been
a
consistent
position,
aren’t
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
somewhere
along
the
line,
have
you
discussed
the
appellee’s
suggestion
that
“lived
with”
may
be
applied
to
some
period
other
than
at
the
time
of
death?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
merrigan,
is
it
correct
to
say
that
your
argument
comes
down
to
whether
the
statute
is
severable,
whether
that
section
is
severable
and
if
it
is,
then
you
say,
jurisdictional
question
is
resolved?
