justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
shapiro,
when
you
say
that
the
act
is
consistently
been
construed
to
require
that
the
“lived
with”
requirement
be
met
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
wage
earner.
how
many
examples
would
there
be
in
the
reported
materials
that
we
could
look
at
in
some
way
or
another
of
cases
in
which
there
was
a
lived
with
at
some
prior
time,
but
not
at
the
day
the
death,
would
there
be
other
cases
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don’t
have
any
feel
for
how
often
this
problem
arises?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
that
mean
twice
or
a
hundred
times,
would
we
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
once
maybe
just
this
case,
wasn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
normally
they
do
things
as
of
the
date
to
death,
but
i’m
just
wondering
how
often
it
really
a
significant
that
the
target
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
4%
figure,
i
think
is
somewhat
misleading,
isn’t
it?
does
that
include
the
children
who’ve
been
acknowledged
by
the
illegitimate
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
it
isn’t
limited
to
that
is
what
i
mean.
that’s
all
illegitimate
children,
isn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
where
the
statute
already
excludes
illegitimate
children
who
have
not
been
acknowledged
by
their
father,
and
the
only
relevance
statistic
and
the
additional
requirement
of
“lived
with”
would
be
those
who
have
not
only
lived
with
their
parent,
but
also
had
been
acknowledged,
and
your
figure
doesn’t
take
that
into
account
at
all.
there’s
4%
of
all
illegitimate
children
is
what
you’re
lived
with
or
never
married
mothers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn’t
the
universe
cut
down
to
those
who’ve
been
acknowledged
by
their
father,
by
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don’t
see
how
that’s
relevant
to
the
“lived
with”
requirement.
now,
if
you
struck
the
“lived
with”
requirement
out
entirely,
you
still
have
the
4%
figure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
probably
didn’t
--
well,
may
i
ask
you
this
on
the
“lived
with”
requirement.
is
the
congressional
judgment
that
--
is
it
your
theory
that
the
congressional
judgment,
if
you
have
a
child,
an
illegitimate
child
who
was
acknowledged
by
his
father
and
lived
with
the
father
for
a
particular
of
time
and
then
stopped
living
with
him,
that
it’s
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
father
then
discontinued
support
because
he
did
in
this
case?
is
there
any
example
that
we
know
of
anywhere
where
a
father
both
acknowledged
the
child,
lived
with
him
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
and
left
and
then
stop
supporting
them?
it
seems
to
me
the
law
would
not
permit
him
to
stop
supporting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
that
said
affair
and
how
could
congress
have
reasonably
assumed
that
he
would
then
just
walk
away
from
the
child
and
no
further
obligation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
which
is
the
more
probable?
that
you
have
both
a
formal
acknowledgment
and
a
family
relationship,
and
then
the
father
abandons
the
child.
wouldn’t
there
normally
be
--
and
he
continues
to
earn
money,
he’s
got
a
job
and
is
paying,
the
government
job
in
this
case,
and
then
you
would
think
then,
the
congress
reasonably
thought
that
in
the
normal
run
of
cases
he
would
stop
providing
any
support
for
the
child.
the
only
case
we
know
about
is
this
one
which
it
didn’t
happen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
congress
actually
made
that
judgment?
see,
they
make
a
contrary
judgment,
if
you
construe
the
statute
to
mean
“lived
with”
at
anytime,
but
that’s
critical
to
your
case,
for
your
construction
of
the
statute,
if
congress
really
thought
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
exist
and
it
followed
in
at
least
one
case.
and
didn’t
the
court
of
claims
also
construe
the
statute
that
way,
the
gentry
case
in
holding
it
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
that
mean
mrs.
shapiro?
there
just
don’t
be
anymore
child’s
benefits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that’s
the
alternative
that
you
recommend.
pay
no
more
child’s
benefits
until
the
statute
is
made
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
had
no
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position
is
that
the
plaintiff
should
then
go
to
another
forum
and
get
an
injunction
against
paying
any
child
benefits
to
anybody,
that’s
what
would
have
to
be
done
if
the
statute
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that
is
what
congress
would
have
wanted
in
this
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
upholds
child’s
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
argued
there,
do
you
--
does
the
government
argue
there
that
all
child’s
benefits
should
cease
until
congress
remedies
the
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
statutory
authority
occurring
[voice
overlap]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
argument
there,
i
take
it
then,
is
that
no
benefits
should
be
paid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
even
currently?
what’s
the
statutory
authority
for
current
benefits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
take,
assume
these
plaintiffs
were
not
in
the
court
of
claims,
but
were
in
the
federal
district
court
and
assume
they
win
on
the
merits,
what
remedy
would
be
appropriate
in
the
government’s
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
word
“recognized
stepchild”
or
“recognized
natural
child,”
doesn’t
that
mean
recognized
by
the
natural
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
could
assume
that
it
did,
yes.
so,
that
in
your
hypothetical
case,
the
women
would
not
recover
it?
