ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
by
the
government
from
a
judgment
of
court
of
claims,
requiring
a
payment
of
survivorship
benefits
to
two
illegitimate
children
of
a
deceased
federal
employee.
the
court
of
claims
found
the
children
were
entitled
to
payment
even
though
they
weren’t
--
could
not
meet
the
eligibility
requirements
of
the
civil
service
retirement
act.
it
relied
upon
its
decision
in
a
previous
case
in
in
which
it
concluded
that
the
statutory
requirement
denied
equal
protection
to
illegitimate
children.
the
government
contends
here
first
that
the
court
of
claims
had
no
jurisdiction
to
award
benefits
in
this
case
and
second,
that
in
any
event,
the
statutory
requirement
is
constitutional.
george
isaacson
was
a
federal
employee
when
he
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
in
1974.
he
was
unmarried,
but
he
was
survived
by
two
illegitimate
children,
shawn
and
tricia
clark,
who
are
represented
by
the
appellee
here.
isaacson
had
recognized
them
and
was
subject
to
a
court
order
requiring
him
to
make
monthly
payments
for
their
support.
although
he
had
lived
with
them
for
a
few
years,
he
had
stopped
living
with
them
more
than
two
years
before
his
death.
the
clark
children
applied
for
benefits
under
the
civil
service
retirement
act.
that
act
provides
for
the
payment
of
monthly
benefits
to
the
surviving
children
of
covered
federal
employees.
the
statute
defines
a
child
to
include
adopted
children,
as
well
as,
stepchildren
and
recognized
natural
children
who
lived
with
a
wage
earner
in
a
regular
parent-child
relationship.
the
civil
service
commission
and
the
office
of
personnel
management
which
is
a
successor
of
this
commission
have
consistently
interpreted
the
statute
as
denying
benefits
to
stepchildren
and
to
illegitimate
children
who
were
not
living
with
the
employee
when
he
died.
since
the
clark
children
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
is
a
proposal
that
was
passed
by
the
house
last
week,
a
bill.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
the
commission
proposed
this
statute
which
would
amend
the
act
to
make
payments
to
dependent
children,
but
would
provide
that
either
a
child
who
lived
with
or
who
received
contributions
from
the
employee
would
be
considered
dependent.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
don’t
believe
there
are
significant
numbers.
i
am
not
sure
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it’s
a
consistent
administrative
interpretation.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
as
far
as
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
i
know
that
it’s
a
more
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i’m
not
sure
that
it
has
been
litigated
before,
but
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
legislation
is
based
on
the
court
decisions.
it’s
not
that
they
have
made
an
administrative
determination.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
commission,
it
interprets
it
in
an
administrative
act
in
paying
benefits.
the
clark
children
sued
in
the
court
of
claims
under
the
tucker
act,
challenging
both
the
commission’s
interpretation
of
the
act
and
its
constitutionality
as
so
interpreted.
they
argued
first
that
they
were
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
act
because
they
had
once
lived
with
isaacson.
alternatively,
they
argued
that
the
act
as
interpreted
by
the
commission
denied
them
equal
protection
because
they
could
not
qualify
for
benefits
by
proving
that
they
were
actually
dependent
on
their
father.
after
this
suit
was
filed,
but
before
it
was
decided
by
the
court
of
claims,
that
court
decided
another
case
challenging
the
“lived
with”
requirement
in
the
civil
service
retirement
act,
that
case
was
gentry
versus
united
states.
gentry
involved
a
child
who
had
never
lived
with
the
federal
employee,
and
the
court
in
that
case
found
that
the
statutory
requirement
was
unconstitutional.
so
when
it
decided
this
case,
the
court
of
claims
followed
gentry.
the
government
didn’t
seek
to
ask
--
didn’t
ask
this
court
to
review
this
decision
in
gentry
because
we
lost
track
of
it
after
the
court
of
claims
remanded
the
case
for
further
findings
by
the
commission.
we
learned
of
the
entry
of
the
final
judgment
only
a
few
days
before
our
time
to
petition
for
certiorari
expired
and
substantially
after
the
time
for
a
note
on
appeal.
by
that
time,
we
knew
that
the
clark
case
and
others
were
coming
along
and
that
the
commission
was
working
on
legislation.
in
november
of
1977,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
decided
proctor
versus
united
states
and
enjoined
the
commission
from
applying
a
“lived
with”
requirement
to
illegitimate
children.
so,
the
commission
began
paying
benefits
under
that
order
from
and
after
december
1,
1977.
finally,
in
the
only
class
action
so
far,
jenkins
versus
the
office
of
personnel
management,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
ordered
the
office
of
personnel
management
to
pay
benefits
retroactively
to
february
1972.
that
order
imposed
a
much
heavier
burden
on
the
resources
of
the
retirement
fund.
that
factor,
plus
the
importance
of
the
retroactivity
question
for
other
federal
benefit
programs
has
led
to
our
decision
to
seek
review
in
this
court
in
this
case.
i
propose
to
focus
today
on
the
question
of
whether
the
court
of
claims
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
case.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
they
are
receiving
benefits
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims.
they
have
not
received
the
lump
sum
that
would
take
them
from
the
time
their
father
died
up
till
the
time
the
stipulation
for
the
entry
of
judgment
was
entered,
but
they
are
currently
receiving
$187.00
a
month.
i
intend
to
rely
primarily
on
of
our
briefs
for
the
issues
raised
by
the
appellee
concerning
this
court’s
jurisdiction
and
the
correctness
of
the
agency’s
interpretation
of
the
act.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
and
i
have
a
few
comments
to
add
towards
the
discussion
in
our
brief
on
the
merits.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
our
argument
on
that
really
is
fairly
simple.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
replace
the
support
that
was
lost
when
the
wage
earner
died,
and
the
“lived
with”
requirement
as
interpreted
by
the
agency
and
is
that
the
time
when
the
support
was
lost
was
at
the
wage
earner’s
death
for
children
who
are
living
with
the
wage
earner
at
that
time.
if
they
stopped
living
with
the
wage
earner
as
the
clark
children
did
several
years
previously,
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
statute
assumes
the
support
was
lost.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
then,
they
are
not
qualified
under
the
statute
because
they
were
not
living
within
in
a
regular
parent-child
relationship
when
he
died
or
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
theory
behind
the
statute
is
that
for
illegitimate
children,
the
easiest
and
simplest
and
most
accurate
way
of
determining
whether
there
was
support
is
by
simply
looking
to
see
whether
they
were
living
with
the
wage
earner.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
would
be
an
alternative
way
of
proving
that
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
right,
but
the
congressional
judgment
was
that
as
this
current
court
has
frequently
recognized,
the
classifications
may
be
minimally
inaccurate
in
some
situations.
you
don’t
focus
on
the
facts
of
the
individual
collocation
look
to
see
whether
the
classification
for
the
general
universe
is
reasonable.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
certainly
is
theoretically
possible.
the
congressional
judgment
was
that
in
the
usual
case,
the
illegitimate
child
who
is
living
with
his
father
is
the
one
who
is
most
likely
to
be
supported
and
that’s
the
situation
in
which
payments
are
to
be
made
and
that
these
other
unusual
situations
fall
outside
the
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
legitimate
children
are
deemed
to
have
been
supported
whether
or
not
they’re
living
with
the
wage
earner.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
right.
the
statute
as
the
statute
in
lucas
is
somewhat
over
inclusive
for
legitimate
children.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
they
provided
for
a
“lived
with”
requirement
that
isn’t
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
act,
because
it’s
an
accurate
indicator
of
support
in
generality
of
the
cases.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
right.
and
the
census
report
that
we
cited
in
our
reply
brief
indicates
that
in
fact,
it’s
an
accurate
indicator
in
all,
but
4%
of
the
cases.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there’s
the
4%.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
what
we
get
from
reading
lalli
in
combination
with
lucas
and
jimenez
is
that,
although
the
statute
may
be
somewhat
unjust
in
individual
cases,
as
long
as
it’s
finally
tuned
and
substantially
related
it’s
constitutional.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
at
most,
there
are
4%
of
the
total
universe
and
that’s
a
finely-tuned
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
it
includes
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
but
even
so,
there’s
no
more
than
4%
of
any
illegitimate
children
who
are
receiving
support
--
payments
from
their
father.
so
that
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
may
mean
that
the
“lived
with”
requirement
is
somewhat
over
inclusive.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
court
order
that
it
doesn’t
necessarily
follow
that
he
complied
with
it
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that’s
the
congressional
judging.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
correct,
and
this
is
the
construction
that
the
agency
is
following
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
in
the
gentry
case,
that
issue
was
not
involved
because
the
gentry
children,
they
had
not
lived
with
their
father
at
all.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
here,
they
didn’t
--
they
followed
gentry
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s,
that’s
true.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
true.
this
case
is
not
is
not
a
statutory
construction
case.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it’s
a
constitutional.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
true.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
would
be
considered
to
be
living
with
in
a
normal
parent-child
relationship.
it’s
not
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
it
would
be.
it’s
not
that
they
have
to
be
under
the
same
house.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
under
same
roof.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
if
the
situation
is
that
they
are
in
school
or
in
summer
camp
or
in
other
situation
that’s
similar
to
what
happens
was
in
normal
parent-child
relationship.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i’m
not
aware
of
any
that
go
along
this
line.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
i
don’t
think
that
sending
a
child
to
school
with
the
intent
that
on
summer
vacations
or
when
it’s
feasible,
they
will
resume
the
normal
relationship
of
living
together
in
the
same
house
is
inconsistent
with
living
within
the
normal
parent-child
relationship.
it’s
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
oh,
no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
no,
no.
and
the
statute
does
have
a
provision
as
a
social
security
act
does
for
children
over
18
who
are
in
school
or
students.
they
are
continued
--
benefits
continued
until
they
reach
22,
i
believe
it
is.
but,
the
point
is
that
what
the
act
is
looking
for
is
an
indication
that
this
is
a
normal
family
relationship
that
these
children
are
being
treated
as
children
usually
are.
they
go
to
school,
they
go
to
camp
or
--
but
they
are
still
children
in
the
family.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
i
think
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
you’ve
got
two
different
situations.
the
situation
that
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
originally
is
a
situation
in
which
the
child
is
living
either
in
a
foster
home
or
in
some
other
situation
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
with
no
intent
that
they
ever
going
to
resume
living
together
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
in
that
case,
that
does
not
sound
to
me,
again,
this
is
something
for
the
agency
but
it
does
not
sound
to
me
like
the
normal
parent-child
relationship.
in
contrast
to
the
situation
where
you’re
sending
a
child
to
school
or
sending
him
to
camp
and
when
he
is
through
with
that,
he
comes
home.
there
are
two
are
distinct
situations.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
if
he
is
living
with
him,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that
is
what
the
statute
--
the
statute
does
not
specifically
says
support,
but
the
statute
says
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
but
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
refers
to
the
living
with.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
not
if
he
is
living
in
the
same
household
with
him
or
this
is
other
situation.
the
tucker
act
gives
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
against
the
united
states
founded
on
the
constitution
or
an
act
of
congress.
there
must
be
money
already
due
to
plaintiff
from
the
government
before
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction.
if
it
has
jurisdiction
because
money
is
due,
the
court
of
claims
may
also
grant
perspective
relief,
but
only
as
an
ancillary
remedy.
this
means
that
the
court
of
claims
here
could
properly
order
the
government
to
put
shawn
and
tricia
clark
on
the
civil
service
annuity
rolls
only
if
they
had
accrued
claim
based
on
some
statute
or
on
the
constitution
against
the
government
for
money
already
due
them,
and
they
did
not.
the
court
of
claims
believed
that
the
children’s
claim
for
accrued
benefits
was
based
on
the
civil
service
retirement
act
read
in
the
light
of
the
constitution,
but
that
makes
an
unconstitutional
intent
to
deny
benefits
into
an
intent
to
grant
benefits.
whether
or
not
the
statutory
denial
of
benefits
to
the
illegitimate
children
who
are
not
living
with
the
wage
earner
is
constitutional,
that
denial
is
what
congress
enacted
and
only
congress
and
not
a
court
can
change
it
into
a
statutory
direction
to
pay
benefits.
a
court
can
decide
that
“lived
with”
requirement
unconstitutionally
discriminates
against
illegitimate
children.
so
that
the
act
can
no
longer
be
enforced
as
written.
and
if
a
district
court
reaches
that
conclusion,
it
can
enjoin
the
agency
from
continuing
to
make
the
unconstitutional
discrimination
required
by
the
act.
but
of
course,
that’s
an
independent
injunction
power
that
the
court
of
claims
doesn’t
have.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that’s
one
alternative.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
that’s
--
if
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
--
our
submission
is
that
the
court
of
claims
is
the
wrong
court
in
which
to
be
presenting
this
claim.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
had
no
jurisdiction
because
there
was
no
accrued
claim
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
exactly.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
in
fact,
that
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
in
this
particular
situation
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
these,
for
the
clark
children
are
presumably
part
of
the
jenkins
class
and
the
jenkins
case
is
in
the
district
court.
[voice
overlap]
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
what
we
are
arguing
in
jenkins
is
that
the
benefits
have
been
paid
since
december
1,
1977
under
the
proctor
decision.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that’s
right.
that
is
no
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
argument
there
is
that
no
benefits
should
be
paid
before
december
1,
1977.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
it
is
not
a
statutory
authority.
that’s
the
standard
doctrine
of
severability.
as
i
said,
when
a
court
finds
that
the
denial
of
benefits
is
--
the
discriminatory
treatment
is
unconstitutional
then
it
can
as
an
alternative
to
holding
that
no
benefits
are
payable.
it
can
direct
that
benefits
be
paid
either
to
all
children.
well,
in
this
situation,
you
could
have
either
benefits
paid
to
all
legitimate
children
who
meet
the
“lived
with”
requirement,
that
is
you
apply
the
qualification
equally
to
all
children.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
if
these
children
were
in
the
district
court?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
then
the
court
would
have
two
alternatives
and
we
would
not
argue
that
the
“lived
with”
requirement
should
be
applied
to
all
children.
we
would
agree
that
it
would
be
appropriate
under
the
injunction
power
to
require
payment
to
these
children
even
though
they
could
not
meet
the
statutory
requirement.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
any
payments
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
believe
that’s
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
don’t
think
they
have.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
i
am
not
sure
that
all
of
them.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
that
is
the
same
--
that
is
barred
by
sovereign
immunity
and
that’s
the
same
argument
in
the
district
court.
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
argument
because
the
district
court
does
have
the
jurisdiction
to
issue.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
precisely.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
exactly
right,
yes.
that
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
5
u.s.c.
702
extends
only
to
injunctions
for
the
future
requirement.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
this
is
what
we
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
we
retest
this
court’s
decision
in
testan;
edelman
v.
jordan
certainly
suggests
that
result.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
for
retroactive
benefits.
the
court
of
claims,
as
i
say,
is
the
wrong
court,
but
if
you
had
a
decision
in
a
district
court,
you
could
get
future
payments
but
for
retroactive
payments,
it’s
only
congress
whether
it’s
a
private
bill
or
it’s
an
amendment
of
the
statute
saying
that
they
intend
to
have
it
be
paid
retroactively.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
am
not
sure.
perhaps,
but
that
is
certainly
would
be
an
alternative.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
see
my
time
is
up.
