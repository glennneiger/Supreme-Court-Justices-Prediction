mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice.
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
two
major
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
on
behalf
of
the
respondents.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
i
will.
the
first
of
those
major
points
is
that
over
many
years,
this
court
has
given
all
of
the
civil
rights
statutes
a
broad
reading.
the
second
major
point
deals
with
the
plain
meaning
of
section
1983
as
it
now
reads.
to
turn
first
to
what
this
court
has
done
in
the
united
states
v
price
and
in
griffin
v
breckenridge,
it
said
quite
clearly
that
all
of
the
reconstruction
civil
rights
statutes
were
to
be
read
broadly
and
literally
and
following
that
instruction,
this
court
has
over
the
last
12
years
reached
a
number
of
decisions
in
section
1983,
social
security
act
cases.
and
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
was
before
this
court
a
claim
for
relief
which
had
to
turn
on
section
1983.
two
of
those
cases
bear
particular
note.
the
first
is
rosado
v
wyman;
and
the
second
is
edelman
v
jordan.
now
rosado
is
important
because
by
the
time
that
case
came
to
this
court,
there
was
no
constitutional
claim
of
any
kind
remaining
in
the
case.
in
fact,
the
constitutional
claim
had
dropped
out
several
years
previously
in
the
district
court
and
in
fact,
even
prior
to
a
remand,
if
that
is
the
proper
word,
from
the
three-judge
court
to
judge
weinstein.
this
court
reached
and
decided
the
statutory
claim;
and
the
only
possible
cause
of
action
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
could
have
asserted
was
based
on
section
1983.
what
had
been
done
in
rosado
was
later
specifically
recognized
and
accepted
in
zaelman;
now
be
it
in
dicta,
edelman
was
of
course
about
retroactive
benefits.
but
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
both
the
majority
and
one
of
the
dissenting
opinions
specifically
recognize
what
had
happened
in
rosado
and
specifically
stated
that
the
cause
of
action
that
was
before
this
court
was
the
statutory
1983
cause
of
action.
the
second
point
is
that,
as
our
brief
points
out,
this
is
a
case
for
the
application
of
the
traditional
primary
rule
of
statutory
construction.
one
looks
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
and
applies
it
unless
there
is
some
very
clear
and
convincing
reason
initially
on
the
face
of
the
statute
to
not
do
so
and
in
this
case,
looking
at
this
statute,
there
is
no
ambiguity
on
its
face
of
any
kind
that
permits
the
insertion
of
modifying
or
limiting
words.
i
should
point
out
here
that
there
are,
of
course,
a
range
of
cases
involving
federal
statutes
where
section
1983
actions
cannot
be
brought.
first
and
foremost,
there
must
be
defendants
who
are
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
second
congress
can,
either
expressly
or
impliedly,
preclude
federal
courts
from
entertaining
section
1983
statutory
causes
of
action.
we
discuss
that
point
in
some
more
detail
in
footnote
12
of
our
brief.
but
once
those
two
major
exceptions
fall
by
the
wayside,
we
are
then
left
with
a
very
clear,
very
plain,
very
unambiguous
statute.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
the
answer
to
--
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
is
yes.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
it
certainly
is.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
that's
correct.
that
is
one
of
the
questions
that
the
maine
supreme
judicial
court
reached
and
resolved
unanimously.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
no
doubt.
and
the
way
i
would
address
that
issue
is
by
saying
several
things.
first,
again
looking
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
it
applies
in
all
courts.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
except
for
footnote
31,
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
footnote
31
addressed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
state
attorney's
fee
provision,
statutory
or
otherwise,
was
substantive;
and
would
be
applied
by
federal
court
in
a
diversity
action.
there
is
also
--
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
yes,
i
realize
that.
but
in
terms
of
looking
to
whether
the
fees
act
applies
in
state
courts,
one
can,
if
one
wishes
then,
look
beyond
the
plain
meaning
of
the
act
itself
and
look
here
to
a
very
clear
and
very
unambiguous
legislative
history.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
the
history
of
this
statute
though
is
also
plain
and
there
are
several
indications
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
one
speech
by
father
drinan,
who
was
here
this
morning,
indicating
that
the
act
was
to
apply
in
both
state
and
federal
courts
and
this
court
has
held
in
sullivan
that
it
does
apply
in
state
courts
although
that
decision
focused
on
the
first
sentence
of
section
1988
which
has
been
in
place
since
the
revised
statutes
were
enacted
in
1874.
it
stands
to
reason
though
--
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
yes.
the
long
sentence
explaining
what
remedies
are
to
be
applied.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
that's
correct.
well,
the
present
1988
is
nothing
but
an
additional
sentence
attached
to
the
original
act.
and
the
other
reason
though
to
look
to
applying
the
second
sentence,
the
fees
act,
if
you
will,
in
state
court,
is
that
in
many
states,
maine
being
one,
it's
a
long,
long
way
to
the
federal
court.
for
people
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
--
if
people
are
to
retain
counsel
of
their
choosing
and
to
bring
cases
in
a
straightforward
statutory
fashion,
they
should
be
able
to
do
that
in
state
court.
they
should
not
have
to
if
they
don't
want
to,
go
to
federal
court.
and
while
we
believe
that
in
this
case
a
constitutional
claim
may
very
well
have
been
made
and
may
very
well
have
passed
the
hagans
test,
there
seemed
no
reason
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
the
problem,
i
suppose,
in
terms
of
focusing
on
the
right
is
that
in
chapman,
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
federal
district
court
may
not
have
jurisdiction
over
many
of
these
cases;
and
the
only
point,
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
rather
than
in
some
cases
go
without
and
in
other
cases
strain
to
resolve
the
problem
that
one
is
left
with
after
chapman
and
with
hagans,
why
not
just
turn
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
i
understand
that.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
well,
if
we
had
filed
the
complaint,
as
we
have
it
here,
there
certainly
would
not
be.
what
i
suggested
--
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
no
question.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
this
was
a
certiorari
petition.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
well,
let
me
say
this
we
are
not
certain.
we
think
it
is,
and
i
can
tell
you
why.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
if
you
look
at
the
act
and
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
act
and
you
look
at
the
way
it
has
been
interpreted
by
a
number
of
circuit
courts,
you
see
that
while
indeed
the
language
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
leases
open,
quote/unquote,
the
discretion
of
the
superior
court,
i
do
not
see
how
that
court
could
exercise
its
discretion
in
any
fashion,
other
than
attorney's
fees.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
well,
i
understand
that.
but
secondly,
this
case
is
not
unlike
any
other
case
where,
after
the
judgment
here,
there
will
be,
seeing
things
my
way
for
a
moment,
nothing
left
to
do
but
to
award
costs.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
they
might.
i'm
not
sure
that
under
state
law
they
can.
that's
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
final
judgment
rule
which
is
somewhat
riddled
with
exceptions
that
this
court
talks
about
in
cox
broadcasting
v
cohen.
there's
a
maine
case
that
may
raise
some
doubts
as
to
the
ability
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
just
about.
i
mean,
as
i
read
cox
broadcasting
and
especially
footnote
7,
i'm
not
sure
i
want
to
say
it's
left
to
the
unreviewable
discretion
of
this
court;
but
it
is.
and
there
seems
to
be
no
real
hard,
fast
rule
in
any
direction.
there's
another
point
that
i
think
that
i
might
make
about
the
statute,
and
the
fees
act
in
particular
and
that
is
contrary
to
the
assertion
that
the
state
is
making
somewhat
silently,
the
fees
act
was
enacted
not
to
benefit
attorneys,
but
to
benefit
the
people
and
to
enable
them
to
obtain
counsel
and
to
be
able
to
litigate
their
valid
claims.
and
that
without
the
fees
act,
many,
many
cases
involving
many,
many
justifiable
claims,
will
go
unremedied.
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
act.
that's
what
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
say,
and
that
is
what's
made
clear
in
the
floor
debates.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
i
think
that
could
be
stated
with
some
certainty.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
yes.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
edmond
mittel
probably.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
then,
the
respondents
would
only
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
maine
supreme
judicial
court
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
