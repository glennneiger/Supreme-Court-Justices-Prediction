were
the
words;
and
laws,
in
the
original
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
they
come
in?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
do
you
suppose
they
were
supposed
to
cover?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
specifically,
to
what
kind
of
laws
do
you
suggest
the
statute
was
limited?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
is
there
a
label
you
can
give
it?
civil
rights
laws
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
one
of
those
words,
those
modifiers
are
in
the
statute,
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
today?
justice
potter
stewart
has
that
been
a
suggested
limitation
upon
the
kinds
of
law?
two
or
three
members
of
the
court
in
the
chapman
case,
in
a
separate
opinion,
expressed
the
pretty
unambiguous
view
that
the
"laws"
meant
what
it
said.
didn't.
justice
potter
stewart
and
specifically,
that
they
included
the
social
security
act?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
although
the
chapman
case
involved
not
1983
directly,
but
1943.
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
the
maine
supreme
court
did
is
to
remand
this
case
to
the
trial
court.
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
exercising
his
jurisdiction,
but
upon
the
hypothesis
that
1988
was
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
so
far
as
now
appears
the
trial
court
may
still
deny
attorney's
fees.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
there
still
remains,
unless
i've
missed
something
you've
said,
one
more
issue,
it
seems
to
me.
even
if
you
are
correct
that
1983
embraces
claims
of
violations
of
the
social
security
act,
and
even
if
you
are
correct
that
such
claims
under
1983
can
be
brought
in
state
courts
which
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
there
still
remains
the
question,
does
there
not,
of
whether
or
not
section
1988,
which
was
enacted
in
response
to
the
alyeska
opinion
in
this
court
which
had
to
do
only
with
the
practice
of
federal
courts
in
awarding
attorney's
fees,
is
applicable
at
all
to
attorney's
fees
in
state
courts.
even
assuming
that
the
first
two
questions
are
answered
yes
that
you're
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
the
1983
action
can
be
brought
in
a
state
court
that
a
1983
action
embraces
a
violation
of
the
social
security
act
but
nonetheless,
the
question
remains
does
1988
apply
to
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
the
prevailing
party
in
a
state
court,
by
contrast
to
the
federal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
an
issue
though.
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
that's
a
remaining
issue
even
if
you're
right
on
the
first
two.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that.
but
the
case
is
here
now.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
one
of
the
issues.
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
true
as
an
historic
matter
of
fact,
is
it
not,
that
the
enactment
of
1988
was
in
direct
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
alyeska
case.
justice
potter
stewart
then
it's
really
true
that
the
alyeska
case
had
to
do
only
with
federal
courts,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
did
footnote
31
say?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
a
little
bit
different
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
sentence
is
the
one
that
borrows
from
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
the
sullivan
opinion
was
rendered
before
the
enactment
of
the
present
1988.
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mittel,
you
mentioned
in
some
of
these
cases,
there'd
be
no
federal
jurisdiction.
i
take
it
there'd
be
no
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
this
very
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you
suggested
you
might
have
drafted
a
constitutional
claim
of
some
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
granted
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
this
clearly
isn't
a
final
judgment.
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
attorney's
fees
may
or
may
not
be
awarded.
we
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
see
how;
but
other
people
might.
justice
potter
stewart
the
rule
is
they're
all
exceptions
now,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
every
law
is
always
enacted
in
the
public
interest
interests
in
the
view
of
congress
that
enacts
it.
isn't
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sure
congress
would
so
state,
if
asked.
justice
potter
stewart
and
often
when
unasked.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
critical
of
you
for
filing
a
petition,
after
all,
we
granted
it.
but
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
this
isn't
final
that
attorney's
fees
may
never
be
allowed.
