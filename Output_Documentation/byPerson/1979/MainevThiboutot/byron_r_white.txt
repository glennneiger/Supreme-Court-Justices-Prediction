justice
byron
r.
white
without
1983,
there's
no
authority
for
counsel
fee
awards?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
laws"
in
1983
if
we
should
construe
that
to
mean
just
what
it
says
laws
and
specifically
social
security
laws,
then
i
gather
there's
a
basis
for
the
1988
counsel
fee
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
really
what
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case.
isn't
it?
