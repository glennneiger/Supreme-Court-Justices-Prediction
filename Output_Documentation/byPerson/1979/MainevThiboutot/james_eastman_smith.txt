mr.
james
eastman
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
to
the
maine
supreme
judicial
court
on
january
21,
1980,
in
the
above
matter.
questions
presented
therein
were
threefold.
first,
whether
the
petitioners'
good
faith
violation
of
the
federal
social
security
act
and
its
regulations,
with
the
resulting
incorrect
reduction
of
afdc
benefits
to
the
respondents,
but
without
a
violation
of
respondents'
constitutional
rights,
constitutes
a
violation
of
42
usc
section
1983.
the
second
question
posed
was
whether
the
civil
rights
act
of
1976,
42
usc
section
1988,
allows
consideration
of
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
respondents
who
prevail
solely
on
a
social
security
act
claim
in
an
action
where
no
violation
of
constitutional
rights
is
found.
the
final
question
was
whether
or
not
42
usc
section
1983
affords
respondents
a
remedy
in
the
state
court
for
a
violation
of
the
social
security
act.
the
statement
of
the
facts
follows.
the
respondents,
lionel
and
joline
thiboutot,
are
married
and
have
eight
children.
four
of
those
children
are
theirs
pursuant
to
their
common
marriage.
three
of
the
children
were
brought
into
the
common
marriage
pursuant
to
a
prior
marriage
of
mr.
thiboutot's.
one
child
was
mrs.
thiboutot's
pursuant
to
a
prior
marriage.
in
november
of
1975,
the
state
of
maine,
department
of
human
services,
reduced,
or
notified
mr.
thiboutot
they
were
going
to
reduce,
his
benefits
pursuant
to
a
change
in
what
we
believe,
deemed
by
federal
regulations.
they
notified
him
of
this
proposed
change.
the
change
was
as
follows.
in
computing
the
net
available
income
of
mr.
thiboutot,
in
order
to
determine
the
amount
of
afdc
benefits
to
be
allowed
for
his
three
children
by
a
prior
marriage,
the
department
would
no
longer
subtract
that
portion
of
mr.
thiboutot's
income
which
went
to
the
support
of
the
four
children
by
the
common
marriage.
the
effect
of
this
was
to
count
as
available,
in
the
computation
of
the
eligibility
benefits,
income
which
was
actually
unavailable
due
to
mr.
thiboutot's
legal
obligation
to
support
his
four
mutual
children.
after
exhausting
their
administrative
remedies,
the
thiboutots,
pursuant
to
a
complaint
filed
in
superior
court,
appealed
the
department's
decision
and
on
their
computation
basis.
this
appeal
was
brought
originally
pursuant
to
maine
rules
of
civil
procedure,
rule
80b,
and
two
statutes
which
in
and
of
themselves
allow
for
the
maine
state
courts
to
take
jurisdiction
of
cases
such
as
this
the
denial
or
a
reduction
of
afdc
benefits.
on
january
7,
1977,
an
amended
complaint
was
filed
in
the
same
court.
this
followed
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
attorneys
fees
act
of
1976.
the
amended
complaint
brought
pursuant
to
1983,
as
well
as
the
other
state
statutes
which
would
have
allowed
jurisdiction
in
the
state
as
well
as
the
cause
of
action,
alleged
violation
of
the
social
security
act,
regulations
pertaining
to
the
social
security
act,
and
also
asked
for
certification
as
a
class
action
which
was
granted.
the
maine
superior
court
entered
judgment
for
the
thiboutots
on
the
merits.
the
petitioners
were
enjoined
from
enforcing
the
challenged
regulations;
and
in
compliance
with
court
order,
adopted
new
regulations.
the
state
also
paid
benefits,
respectively,
to
all
class
members
who
were
eligible;
and
also
paid
retroactive
benefits
to
the
thiboutots.
however,
another
issue
is
still
before
the
court,
and
that
issue
is
attorney's
fees.
the
court
in
subsequent
motion
denied
the
respondents'
plea
for
attorney's
fees,
which
was
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
for
the
state
of
maine.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
whether
or
not
section
1983
applies
--
or
whether
a
violation
of
the
social
security
act
is
encompassed
within
the
parameters
of
section
1983.
the
reason
for
this,
your
honor,
is
that
the
wording
of
section
1988,
the
attorneys
fees
awards
act,
allows
the
discretionary
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
order
to
enforce
a
provision
of
section
1983.
so
without
a
violation
of
section
1983,
in
this
case,
you
would
not
have
attorney's
fees
that
could
be
awarded
to
respondents.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
concluded
that
a
right
exists
to
sue
under
42
usc
1983
in
a
state
court
that
a
similar
right
also
exists
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act,
even
though
the
claim
is
not
of
constitutional
dimension;
and
that
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
for
violation
of
the
social
security
act
may
be
considered.
a
dispute
over
the
computation
of
welfare
benefits
without
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
or
any
violation
of
civil
rights,
was
not
in
the
petitioner's
mind
within
the
realm
of
foreseeability
or
within
the
intent
of
the
legislators,
drafters,
and
enactors
of
the
predecessors
of
section
1983,
to
wit,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
which
was
also
known
as
the
ku
klux
klan
act.
the
historical
background,
and
this
court
is
well
aware
of
this,
of
the
times
when
the
1871
act
was
enacted
during
reconstruction
days,
depicted
a
very
sordid
time
in
the
history
of
this
country;
almost
all
rights
that
blacks
were
to
have
enjoyed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
not
available
to
them.
there
were
burnings
there
were
pillages
there
were
no
rights
of
property
that
negroes
could
enjoy.
this
court
has
recognized
that.
however,
in
response
thereto,
congress
passed
the
civil
rights
acts
of
1866,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
well
as
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
the
ku
klux
klan
act.
as
this
court
has
said
in
chapman
v
houston
welfare
rights
organization,
in
cases
of
statutory
construction,
our
task
is
to
interpret
the
words
of
those
statutes
in
light
of
the
purposes
congress
sought
to
serve.
it
is
the
state's
contention
that
the
purposes
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act,
the
predecessor
of
section
1983,
were
to
provide
enforcement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
amendment
is
not
at
issue
today.
there
has
been
no
due
process
violations
or
allegations
thereof
there
have
been
no
equal
protection
violations
or
allegations
thereof.
another
purpose
of
section
1871
was
to
counteract
violations
of
basic
liberties.
they
are
not
at
stake
in
this
case
or
at
issue.
another
purpose
of
the
act
of
1871
was
to
provide
a
remedy
when
a
state
law
existed
in
theory,
but
was
unavailable
in
practice.
here,
in
contrast,
we
have
a
state
law
that
was
available
in
practice
it
was
available
in
reality;
and
indeed,
the
state
law
without
section
1983,
afforded
the
respondents
the
rights
to
appeal
under
the
fair
hearing
provisions
and
also
to
have
the
state's
regulation
overturned.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
says
what,
sir?
i
didn't
understand
you.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
if
we're
getting
into
jurisdiction,
sir?
mr.
james
eastman
smith
ok.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
of
this
court
that
say
that,
your
honor
however,
i
am
reserving
as
a
third
argument
the
jurisdictional
aspect
of
state
courts
of
1983.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
to
this
court
is
that
without
1983,
the
respondents
had
appropriate
remedies
in
a
state
court
pursuant
to
state
laws.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
may
it
please
the
court.shortly
before
the
lunch
break,
mr.
chief
justice
burger
posed
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
in
the
absence
of
a
section
1988
authorization
for
attorney's
fees
in
the
present
matter,
the
respondents
would
be
able
to
collect
attorney's
fees,
if
they
prevail.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
state
of
maine
under
that
situation
as
we
had
before
the
authorization
in
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
however,
we
would
say
that
this
certainly
does
not
place
the
respondents
necessarily
in
a
different
category
from
other
persons
in
this
country
who
are
serving
or
seeking
to
obtain
legal
services.
also
there
is
the
pro
bono
aspect
of
legal
work
and
finally,
there
is
the
legal
aid
societies
which
have
been
in
effect
for
several
years
in
this
country.
your
petitioner
was
stating
that
the
purposes
of
the
civil
rights
act,
as
shown
by
the
enactors
and
legislators
pursuant
to
its
predecessor,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
was
basically
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
provisions
and
other
rights;
and
to
prevent
further
trampling
of
those
rights
by
the
ku
klux
klan.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
no,
sir.
they
were
not.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
they
came
in
in
1874
pursuant
to
the
revised
draft.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
the
petitioner
claims,
your
honor,
that
the
"and-laws"
provision
was
to
relate
to
the
act
of
1866;
the
laws
contained
therein,
as
well
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
provisions
equal
rights,
civil
rights
but
not
the
social
security
act
without
a
violation
of
some
due-process,
equal-protection
discriminatory
action.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
well,
if
i
may
give
an
example
--
mr.
james
eastman
smith
civil
rights
laws;
equal
rights
laws.
where
one
starts
and
the
other
stops,
i'm
not
sure
myself.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
they
are
not.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
no,
sir.
the
statute
says
and
laws
however,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
it
has
been
interpreted
by
concurring
opinions
in
the
chapman
decision
to
encompass
equal
rights,
as
it
has
also
been
interpreted
in
a
concurring
opinion
not
to.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
just
as
three
members
stated
the
opposite
--
mr.
james
eastman
smith
yes,
sir.
the
jurisdictional
aspect.
here,
again,
we
don't
have
problems
with
the
respondents
obtaining
what
relief
they're
seeking,
in
the
absence
of
1983.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
the
petitioner
also
asserts
--
mr.
james
eastman
smith
for
counsel
fees.
no,
sir.
as
far
as
the
relief
which
respondents
sought
and
received,
1983
was
superfluous.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
yes,
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
state
would
also
refer
to
the
majority
opinion
in
chapman
and
state
that
one
purpose
again
of
the
congress
in
the
act
of
1871
was
to
ensure
right
of
action
to
enforce
the
protections
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
federal
laws
enacted
pursuant
thereto.
and
it
is
petitioners
firm
assertion
that
the
social
security
act
was
not
a
law
that
was
enacted
pursuant
to
the
civil
rights
act.
in
fact,
taking
into
consideration
the
passions
and
events
of
the
time,
the
reconstruction
day
era,
your
petitioners
find
it
difficult
to
believe
the
legislators,
drafters,
or
revisers
could
have
contemplated
a
good
faith
error
in
computation
of
welfare
benefits
to
be
a
violation
of
civil
rights
or
the
constitution
and
"laws"
as
they
knew
them
at
that
time.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
there
had
been
and
if
people
had
been
deprived
of
benefits
pursuant
to
a
discriminatory
action
because
of
their
race
or
ethnic
background,
such,
we'd
say
it
would
apply
but
not
under
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
yes,
sir.
however,
it's
the
state's
contention
that
section
1988
would
not
apply
to
the
violations
in
this
case
before
the
bar,
before
the
banc.
this
is
predicated
upon
two
main
assertions.
the
first
is
that
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
was
based
upon
fourteenth
amendment
violations.
the
second
is
predicated
upon
the
lack
of
specific
statutory
authorization,
as
we
believe
was
mandated
by
the
alyeska
pipeline
decision.
now,
in
hutto
v
finney,
this
court
awarded
attorney's
fees
but
they
awarded
attorney's
fees
pursuant
to
violations
of
both
the
eighth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
neither
of
which
are
at
issue
herein.
in
fitzpatrick
we
had
a
discrimination
claim.
we
do
not
have
any
discrimination
in
this
case.
since
1866,
congress
has
seen
fit
to
enact
over
50
statutes
is
provide
for
attorney's
fees,
but
they
have
not
done
so
regarding
the
social
security
act,
except
in
limited
areas.
one
of
those
areas
was
section
406(b)(1)
which,
i
believe
was
amended
in
1966,
1968,
and
dealt
with
disability
claims.
had
congress
seen
fit
to
specifically
authorize
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
for
a
good
faith
violation
in
computing
of
benefits,
it
is
petitioners'
assertion
that
they
surely
would
have
done
so,
and
made
it
more
plain
than
is
made
in
the
ambiguous
history
of
that
act
as
going
through
the
record
as
well
as
through
the
debates.
once
more,
the
wording
of
the
act
is,
that
in
the
discretion
of
the
court,
if
a
party
prevails
on
the
civil
rights
1983
among
other
civil
rights
claims,
and
if
it
is
a
proceeding
or
action
to
enforce
a
provision
of
section
1983,
attorney's
fees
would
be
proper.
once
again,
this
was
not
an
action
to
enforce
a
provision
of
1983,
as
petitioners
assert.
respondents
have
argued
that
the
plain
meaning
theory
would
prevent
any
research
into
the
history
of
section
1983
prior
to
the
revised
statutes
of
1979.
the
state
would
counter
this
by
saying
that
throughout
concurring
opinions
and
dissenting
opinions
in
chapman,
we
believe
that
the
court
has
already
gone
beyond
the
revised
statutes
of
1874
and
recognized
that
delving
into
the
history
prior
to
1874
is
indeed
necessary.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
also
gone
into
the
background
of
1983
before
the
revision
of
1874
one
of
those
cases
was
district
of
columbia
v
carter,
the
other
was
examining
board
v
otero
de
flores.
the
respondents
have
not
considered
section
1983
in
light
of
the
events
and
passions
of
the
times
in
which
it
was
enacted
for
this
reason
we
believe
that
there
are
arguments
that
the
"and
laws"
provision
applies
must
be
denied.
finally,
the
state,
while
reserving
some
time
for
rebuttal,
would
like
to
make
brief
mention
of
its
third
argument
having
to
do
with
exclusive
jurisdiction.
the
state
alleges
that
the
state
court
does
not
have
authority
to
hear
a
section
1983
claim
in
a
state
court.
this
was
brought
to
bear
in
the
state
court
of
maine
we
brought
it
forward
for
this
court
for
your
disposition.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
i
am
not
aware
of
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
excuse
me.
i
believe
that
an
issue
reserved
in
there
was
whether
or
not
the
states
must
near.
in
reading
that
case,
the
state
does
not
--
i
guess
the
state
would
contest
that,
it
strictly
and
solely
held
that
and
that
it
precluded
this
argument.our
argument
is
basically
that
if
one
were
to
look
at
the
specific
words
of
the
act
of
1871,
we
would
find
that
the
district
and
circuit
courts
were
given
jurisdiction
to
the
exclusion
of
the
state
courts
as
well
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
purposes
of
the
act,
when
state
courts
were
indeed
violating
many
of
the
civil
rights
which
the
acts
of
1866
and
1871
were
passed
to
enforce.
for
these
reasons,
the
state
would
ask
this
court
to
overturn
the
decision
of
the
maine
supreme
judicial
court
and
specifically
to
state
that
the
social
security
act
is
not
within
the
provisions
of
section
1983.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
he
did,
sir,
for
the
sole
purpose
of--
mr.
james
eastman
smith
yes,
sir.
for
determination
of
attorney's
fees.
the
lower
court
did
not
state
why
they
denied
attorney's
fees.
that
was
the
purpose
for
remand.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
that's
quite
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
very
briefly,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
going
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
the
finality
of
the
decision,
we
would
just
state
that
the
language
of
section
1988
in
any
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
a
provision
of
sections,
among
them
1983.
when
the
maine
judicial
supreme
court
made
that
determination
on
remand
that
this
issue
is
going
to
be
considered
and
that
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act
is
applicable
in
the
state
action
that
we
believe
that
the
finality
to
the
present
action,
which
was
why
we
brought
our
writ
at
the
time
that
we
did.
mr.
james
eastman
smith
as
far
as
the
1983
question
goes
though,
we
believe
it
to
be
final.
