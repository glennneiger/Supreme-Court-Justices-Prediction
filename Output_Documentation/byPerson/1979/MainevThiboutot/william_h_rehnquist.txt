justice

there
certainly
were
social
security
benefits
at
the
time
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
act
was
enacted
in
'76.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
get
you
back
a
moment,
if
i
may,
to
the
first
part
of
your
answer
in
my
brother
stewart's
question.
your
supreme
judicial
court
rejected
in
terms,
did
it
not,
that
attorney's
fees
were
recoverable
under
state
law
for
this
kind
of
thing.
it
said
it
had
to
be
1988
or
nothing,
in
part
i
of
its
opinion,
because
the
state
of
maine
hadn't
waived
its
sovereign
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
we've
rejected
the
same
argument
when
made
from
an
opposite
side
in
the
sense
that
you
must
have
counsel
for
a
person
charged
with
a
misdemeanor
who
may
get
a
prison
sentence
in
a
very
large
state
where
there
may
be
12
or
14
counties
and
it
would
be
a
very
great
burden
on
the
state
to
supply
counsel
or
a
magistrate
or
that
sort
of
thing.
we've
said
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
if
the
right
is
there,
it's
there.
and
i
would
think
that
by
inverse
logic,
the
same
is
true
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
some
of
the
far
western
states,
thinly
populated,
the
prosecution's
option
is
frequently
to
just
go
without
in
prosecuting
a
misdemeanor
case
where
they
might
want
a
prison
term
of
6
months
or
one
month
or
whatever
it
may
be;
simply
because
there
are
just
not
enough
resources
there.
