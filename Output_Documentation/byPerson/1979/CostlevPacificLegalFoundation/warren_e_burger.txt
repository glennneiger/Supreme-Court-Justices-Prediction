chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
costle
v.
pacific
legal
foundation.
mr.
alsup,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
opening
comment
suggests
to
me
that
at
some
point
i
hope
you
will
discuss
whether
there
is
a
live
case
here
any
longer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
some
feeling
that
it
may
be
running
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
alsup.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
resume,
mr.
alsup.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
how
would
they
get
into
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
intervention
at
that
stage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
any
stranger,
any
citizen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
alsup.
mr.
best.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
mr.
alsup's
assertion
and
in
the
briefs
that
no
factual
issues
were
raised
initially?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
is
it
insufficient?
why
can't
it
delegate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
tell
me
now
where
we
would
find
that
in
this
appendix
or
in
these
briefs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statement
that
you
just
made,
even
a
ministerial
act
can't
be
delegated
to
the
regional
body.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
now
touching
on
what
i
asked
the
solicitor
general
at
the
outset
-
what
are
we
really
doing
here
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
ordinarily
aren't
those
things
resolved
by
having
someone
come
in
and
say
there
are
factual
issues
and
they
are
as
follows
and
we
want
a
hearing;
was
that
done
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no,
the
hearing
that
epa
said,
in
effect,
it
was
waived.
the
epa
says
that
no
one
asked
for
a
hearing
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
have
to
wait
a
couple
of
months?
thirteen
days
will
take
you
beyond
the
17th
of
december.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
you
can
explain
something
that
would
help
me.
on
page
22-a
of
the
opinion,
reading
the
end
of
the
paragraph,
section
4
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
the
last
sentence
is
"an
adjudicatory
hearing
undoubtedly
will
yield
a
record
that
will
provide
the
reasons
for
the
extension."
then
in
a
few
other
places
in
the
final
paragraphs
under
the
title
of
remand
and
guidelines,
the
language
is
"a
proper
hearing."
now,
is
"a
proper
hearing"
to
be
treated,
the
adjective
"proper"
to
be
treated
as
equivalent
to
the
adjective
"adjudicatory"?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
kind
of
a
hearing
is
that,
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
one
does
"proper"
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
get
a
legislative
--
there
is
nothing
in
here
about
the
legislative.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
no
appeal
had
been,
no
petition
had
been
sought
here
and
none
granted,
what
would
have
happened
in
the
meantime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no.
if
there
had
been
no
effort
to
bring
the
case
here,
what
would
have
happened?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
have
been
quite
a
while
ago,
some
months
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
alsup,
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
would
have
to
start
over,
as
your
friend
put
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
costle,
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
against
pacific
legal
foundation
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
