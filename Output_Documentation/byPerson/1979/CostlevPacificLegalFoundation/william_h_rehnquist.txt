those
are
kind
of
analogous
to
differences
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
that,
but
what
i
was
getting
at
was
that
your
distinction
is
similar
to
that
made
in
the
apa.
one
is
kind
of
a
regulation
of
legislative
effect
having
broad
effect
on
what
the
agency
proposes
to
do
interpreting
a
provision
of
the
statute
will
have
in
future
applicability
to
a
broad
number
of
people.
and
an
adjudication
being
a
much
narrower
determination
of
a
factual
nature
as
to
what
happened
on
a
particular
day
or
what
didn't
happen
on
a
particular
day.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
the
legislative-type
hearing
that
you
described
is
more
like
an
adjudicatory
hearing
than
it
would
be
under
the
apa.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
sua
sponte
on
the
court's
part?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
contend
that
the
notice
in
the
l.a.
times
in
december
was
not
sufficient
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
as
to
the
issues
specified
in
the
notice,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
there
a
december
notice
published
by
the
epa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
publication
by
a
regional
board
is
insufficient.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
take
a
kind
of
down
to
earth
example
of
a
typical
state
procedure
where
probating
a
will
you
have
a
requirement
the
executor
give
notice
ten
days
that
the
will
will
be
offered
for
probate.
and
a
notice
is
published
that
the
will
of
so
and
so
will
be
offered
for
probate
at
9:30
in
such
and
such
a
division
of
such
and
such
a
court.
and
someone
comes
in
later
and
proves
that
although
that
notice
was
given
conformed
to
the
statute
in
every
way,
actually
it
wasn't
the
executor
that
authorized
its
publication,
it
was
somebody
else,
although
it
complied
with
all
the
substantive
requirements
of
the
statute.
would
you
say
such
a
notice
was
deficient?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
to
say
it
is
not
binding
isn't
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
notice
published
by
the
state
board
may
not
be
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
notice
required
by
a
statute
from
the
environmental
protection
agency.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
epa
simply
disagrees
with
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
opportunity
for
hearing
language
in
the
statute,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
the
epa
wants
us
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
no
one
would
dispute
the
proposition
that
there
ought
to
be
a
"proper"
hearing,
if
that
means
the
hearing
required
by
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
the
ninth
circuit
tie
its
stay
of
the
u.s.
enforcement
action
in
the
district
court
to
this
court's
action
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ninth
circuit
felt
that
if
it
were
affirmed
here,
that
the
government
failed
in
its
enforcement
proceedings
in
the
district
court?
