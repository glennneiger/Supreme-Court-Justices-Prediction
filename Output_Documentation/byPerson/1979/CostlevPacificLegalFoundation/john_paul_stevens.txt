justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
trying
to
get
the
chronology
in
mind.
you
said
the
negative
declaration
in
november
of
1967,
i
believe
it
was,
advised
you
of
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
after
that,
if
i
have
my
notes
correct,
there
was
a
public
hearing
in
january
of
1977
concerning
the
preceding
six-month
extension.
was
the
matter
that
you
are
now
interested
in
having
the
subject
of
hearing,
the
subject
of
that
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
was
that
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
before
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
another
question
in
trying
to
understand
the
chronology.
have
they
started
hauling
the
sludge
pursuant
to
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project
yet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
when
it
may
get
under
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
permit
that
is
now
in
effect
expires
a
couple
of
weeks
from
now,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
probable
that
before
it
can
be
extended
again
there
will
have
to
be
some
kind
of
a
notice
of
a
proceeding
to
extend
it
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
gives
you
that
notice
before
--
between
now
and
december
17
--
will
you
then
have
an
opportunity
to
argue
everything
you
want
to
argue
concerning
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
do
we
have
to
decide
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
vacated
the
stay
just
today;
if
they
vacated
the
stay,
what
would
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
going
to
take
them
more
than
between
now
and
december
17
to
start
hauling
sludge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can't
you
get
a
hearing
in
connection
with
that
extension?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
the
entire
thing
is
subject
to
a
stay
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
we
--
what
if
two
months
from
now
we
decided
against
you,
what
would
the
epa
have
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
that
time
the
--
if
we
decide
against
you,
the
stay
is
dissolved,
the
epa
has
held
all
the
hearing
that
it
needed
to
hold
--
the
only
thing
is,
the
permit
has
expired.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
they
are
going
to
have
to
start
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
suppose
they
had
some
interest
in
finding
out
what
they
had
to
do
when
they
started
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
they
are
maintaining
now,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
we
decide
for
you,
what
happens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
any
event,
whichever
way
the
case
is
decided,
all
you
are
talking
about
is
what
kind
of
procedures
should
the
epa
follow
in
issuing
the
new
permit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
your
position,
i
take
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
best,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
now
requires
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project
to
commence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
order
outstanding?
is
there
anything
that
now
requires
los
angeles
to
go
forward
with
that
project?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
what
date;
what
date
does
it
have
to
start
doing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
all
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
passed.
