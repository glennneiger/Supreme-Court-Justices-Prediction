mr.
robert
k.
best
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
underlying
dispute
which
causes
this
litigation
to
go
forward
is
a
dispute
over
a
project
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
which
is
called
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project.
now,
it
is
true
when
we
challenged
the
permit
we
were
concerned
about
other
issues
but
the
primary
underlying
concern
was
this
interim
sludge
disposal
project
which
has
been
mentioned
by
mr.
alsup.
this
project
created
a
substantial
controversy
when
it
was
first
announced
by
epa
in
a
negative
declaration
in
november
of
1976.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
permit
requirements
were
issued
in
1975
but
if
you
look
at
the
permit
as
it
is
contained
in
the
appendix,
you
will
see
that
it
does
not
say
what
the
disposal
project
is
going
to
be
when
the
sludge
discharge
is
terminated;
it
does
not
detail
what
it
is
going
to
be.
so
interested
parties
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
they
were
dealing
with
until
the
negative
declaration
announced
the
content,
and
that
is
when
the
controversy
first
arose.
i
think
the
court
should
understand
that
what
this
project
is
and,
in
particular,
what
this
project
is
not.
it
is
argued
in
the
brief
and
mr.
alsup
has
indicated
that
this
project
proceeds
pursuant
to
a
compliance
schedule
which
is
going
to
terminate
the
sludge
discharge.
it
does
not
do
that.
this
project
is
what
it
says
it
is,
it
is
an
interim
project,
an
interim
sludge
disposal
project
which
modifies
the
sludge
discharge
pending
some
eventual
decision
about
what
the
sludge
discharge
should
be.
this
modification,
in
essence
what
happens,
instead
of
pumping
the
sludge
out
into
the
ocean
it
goes
through
large
centrifuges,
centrifuges
split
into
two
products,
one,
a
semi-liquid
goo
which
is
the
main
product
of
the
sludge,
which
is
supposed
to
be
trucked
through
huge
gondola
trucks
and
dumped
in
landfills
in
the
los
angeles
area.
and
the
estimates,
if
you
read
the
city
of
los
angeles'
description
of
this,
which
is
in
the
appendix,
it
says
that
if
you
live
along
that
route
one
of
these
huge
trucks
is
going
to
pass
your
home
every
3-1/2
minutes.
now,
there
still
remains
the
primarily
liquid
product
which
is
produced
by
the
centrifuges,
which
still
contains
high
concentrations
of
sludge
particles
and
other
materials
in
the
sludge.
under
this
project,
that
continues
to
be
discharged
out
into
the
ocean.
so
we
are
not
implementing
the
requirements
of
the
water
act,
we
are
not
terminating
the
sludge
discharge
by
this
interim
sludge
disposal
project.
and
that
is
one
of
the
concerns
that
needs
to
be
addressed
in
any
public
hearing.
mr.
robert
k.
best
are
you
referring
to
the
request
for
an
adjudicatory
hearing,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
robert
k.
best
we
would
have
two
answers
to
that.
initially,
i
will
describe
for
you
our
view
of
the
facts
as
they
progressed,
which
is
considerably
different
from
the
description
by
mr.
alsup.
we
believe
that
under
the
facts
which
progressed
we
had
no
way
of
putting
into
a
request
for
a
hearing
detailed
factual
issues.
the
purpose
of
the
request
of
a
requirement
for
the
statement
of
factual
issues
of
course
is
to
be
able
to
determine
whether
the
factual
issues
upon
which
the
agency's
decision
rests
are
in
dispute,
not
just
factual
issues
in
general.
but
at
the
time
we
had
to
prepare
the
request
for
adjudicatory
hearing,
epa
had
withheld
from
us
the
decision,
they
had
withheld
any
information
as
to
why
the
reasons
for
the
decision.
they
have
provided
us
only
with
a
telephone
call
which
said,
"we
took
the
action
on
june
2,
if
you
want
an
adjudicatory
hearing
you
must
request
it
today."
that
is
why
when
you
look
in
the
record,
it
is
a
telegraphic
request
for
hearing
that
was
prepared
in
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
hours
to
meet
a
mandate
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
that
it
be
on
file
within
two
days.
so
we
believe
that
under
those
facts,
the
fact
that
this
request
for
hearing
stated
only
general
issues
is
acceptable.
besides
that,
we
had
been
in
dispute
with
epa.
epa
knew
what
the
issues
were
we
were
concerned
about.
before
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
there
has
never
been
the
hearing.
mr.
robert
k.
best
there
was
never
scheduled.
it
was
denied.
mr.
robert
k.
best
when
we
submitted
the
request
for
hearing
we
were
interested
in
raising
the
issues
relating
to
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project,
which
are
factual
issues
-
when
should
it
be
implemented,
can
we
get
the
trucks,
what
landfill
should
be
utilized,
these
are
factual
issues.
the
request
for
hearing
does
say
should
the
compliance
schedule
in
the
permit
go
forward,
pending
the
environmental
studies
that
will
give
us
the
information
relating
to
what
landfill
should
be
used,
and
so
forth.
but
it
is
the
compliance
schedule
for
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project
that
is
challenged
in
that
request
for
hearing.
and
we
believe
that
that
was
a
specific
enough
notice
of
the
factual
issues
we
wanted
to
litigate.
the
epa
before
the
court
of
appeals
admitted
that.
it
stated
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
only
issues
that
were
made
were
procedural
legal
issues
and
issues
relating
to
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project.
and
so
we
believe
that
in
fact
it
did
raise
the
factual
issues.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
k.
best
it
was
not
discussed
at
that
hearing.
let
me
briefly
recount
the
facts
so
you
can
have
your
chronology
straight,
mr.
justice
stevens.
after
the
negative
declaration,
the
controversy
arose
and
we
became
involved.
we
sent
to
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
said,
"that
is
a
bad
project,
let's
talk
about
what
should
be
done."
and
the
city
of
los
angeles
said,
"there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it,
it
is
required
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
in
a
permit."
we
then
proceeded
to
write
to
the
environmental
protection
agency,
and
that
letter
is
in
the
record,
where
we
said,
"wait
a
minute.
we
don't
want
these
requirements
included
in
any
future
permit
and
we
specifically
ask
that
before
they
are
included
in
any
future
permit,
that
the
agency
go
through
the
full
public
participation
requirements
in
the
act."
now,
the
environmental
protection
agency
says
that
wasn't
a
request
for
a
legislative-type
hearing,
because
we
didn't
use
the
word
"hearing."
all
we
asked
for
was
the
full
public
participation
requirement.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
was
done
in
december
of
1976.
mr.
robert
k.
best
shortly
before
that,
there
had
been
an
announcement
in
the
los
angeles
times
that
this
permit
was
going
to
be
reconsidered,
the
terms
and
conditions
were
going
to
be
reconsidered.
the
action
that
epa
took
then,
in
january
of
1977,
was
to
temporarily
defer
action
on
a
final
decision
of
what
to
do
with
the
permit.
they
said,
"we
need
more
time"
--
this
is
in
the
record
as
well
--
"we
need
more
time
to
review
these
requirements
in
this
permit,
so
we
are
going
to
extend
this
temporarily
while
we
review
the
requirements
in
the
permit."
mr.
robert
k.
best
no,
we
do
not
contend
that.
the
notice
in
the
l.a.
times
as
to
the
january
issue
was
deficient,
because
it
was
issued
strictly
by
the
state
board.
the
environmental
protection
agency
never
issued
a
notice
as
to
that
january
meeting.
so
they
went
forward
and
conducted
their
action
without
adequate
notice.
but
when
we
saw
the
action
we
didn't
object
to
the
action,
so
we
didn't
raise
any
claims
against
the
action.
mr.
robert
k.
best
there
was
not.
in
the
record
is
our
request
for
that
notice,
and
the
notice
they
sent
back
to
us
was
published
by
the
regional
board.
there
was
no
notice
published
by
the
environmental
protection
agency.
mr.
robert
k.
best
it
is
insufficient
for
the
environmental
protection
agency.
now,
this
is
a
part
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
because
the
environmental
protection
agency
maintains
as
a
position
in
this
action
that
the
regional
board
has
no
authority
as
to
its
permit.
nobody
realized
this
at
the
time
but
the
environmental
protection
agency
says,
"now,
the
actions
taken
by
the
regional
board
modifying
the
compliance
schedule
were
in
fact
not
valid,
were
not
actions
of
the
environmental
protection
agency."
if
the
actions
taken
by
the
board
modifying
the
permit
are
not
valid,
then
the
actions
by
the
board
notifying
that
they
are
going
to
have
hearings
on
modifications
would
not
be
valid
as
to
epa.
in
addition
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
i
would
not
argue
such
a
notice
was
deficient,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
that
is
not
the
facts
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
as
i
say,
epa
maintains
that
the
state
board
has
no
legal
authority
to
act
for
or
bind
the
environmental
protection
agency.
that
is
the
position
of
the
environmental
protection
agency,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
robert
k.
best
you
can
determine
that
from
the
solicitor.
the
other
point
is
the
notice
by
the
regional
board
does
not
comply
with
the
environmental
protection
agency's
regulations
as
to
what
should
be
in
a
notice
for
the
environmental
protection
agency's
action.
mr.
robert
k.
best
which
record
is
that?
mr.
robert
k.
best
there
is
nothing
in
the
briefs
that
say
that.
it
is
the
environmental
protection
agency
which
maintains
in
its
brief
and
in
the
reply
brief
in
particular,
that
the
actions
by
the
state
board
are
not
binding
on
the
environmental
protection
agency.
mr.
robert
k.
best
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
willing
to
accept
that
statement.
but
i
would
again
point
out,
first
of
all,
that
the
notice
as
published
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
environmental
protection
agency's
regulations.
the
state
board
published
its
notice
pursuant
to
state
law,
which
has
completely
different
requirements
concerning
the
content
of
the
notice.
the
second
thing
is
we
have
never
challenged
the
adequacy
of
that
notice,
and
i
don't
wish
to
challenge
it
today.
we
did
not
challenge
the
january
proceeding,
because
the
january
proceeding
was
satisfactory
to
us.
it
extended
the
time
for
the
permit
so
that
they
could
reconsider
the
requirements
in
the
permit.
and
that
is
what
we
wanted
to
have
done.
and
it
was
our
argument
that
more
time
was
necessary,
we
had
to
change
this
compliance
schedule
in
order
to
get
the
time
to
consider
these
issues.
and
so
we
did
not
challenge
that
issue.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project
is
not
under
way.
as
i
understand
it
the
centrifuges
are
still
in
storage
here
on
the
east
coast.
mr.
robert
k.
best
it
will
not
get
under
way
as
long
as
the
stay
put
in
effect
by
the
ninth
circuit
remains
in
effect.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
permit
by
its
term
expires
on
december
17.
mr.
robert
k.
best
we
believe
before
it
can
be
extended
again
epa
must
go
back
through
its
entire
process,
issue
its
notice,
give
us
our
public
hearing,
and
if
necessary
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
k.
best
because
the
environmental
protection
agency
refuses
to
start
the
permit
proceedings.
we
have
asked
them
what
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
if
they
vacated
the
stay,
that
would
delight
the
environmental
protection
agency,
because
then
they
could
go
ahead
and
enforce
this
permit
which
has
these
requirements
that
we
want
modified.
mr.
robert
k.
best
it
certainly
will.
but
the
key
is
by
not
acting,
by
inaction
the
environmental
protection
agency
automatically
extends
the
permit
pursuant
to
section
558
of
the
epa
because
the
city
of
los
angeles
has
filed
an
application
for
a
new
permit,
which
includes
some
of
these
modifications
we
are
concerned
about.
mr.
robert
k.
best
we
certainly
can.
our
concern
is
--
mr.
justice
stevens,
our
concern
here
today
is
that
if
the
stay
is
vacated
and
epa
does
nothing,
then
this
case
merrily
goes
forward
and
they
can
require
the
permit
to
be
implemented.
i
assume
that
they
will
proceed
with
their
enforcement
action
that
they
have
already
filed
against
the
city
of
los
angeles
where
they
are
asking
the
court
to
order
the
city
of
los
angeles
to
implement
the
interim
sludge
disposal
project.
and
i
presume
they
will
proceed
with
that
and
they
will
just
not
issue
a
new
permit.
mr.
robert
k.
best
quite
frankly,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
understand
why
we
are
here
because
the
environmental
protection
agency
should
be
going
through
the
process
of
issuing
a
new
permit.
if
that
process
were
under
way,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
us
to
be
here
today.
the
problem
is
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
not,
and
they
have
told
us
that
they
will
not
initiate
proceedings
on
this
permit
until
the
courts
resolve
what
procedural
requirements
they
have
to
go
through.
i
assume
that
means
this
honorable
court.
and
that
is
why
we
are
concerned.
the
permit
proceedings
should
have
been
initiated
six
months
ago.
for
a
permit
as
complicated
as
this
it
takes
at
least
four,
possibly
more
months
to
go
through
the
process
to
get
it
issued.
under
epa's
new
regulations
for
the
npdes
permits,
a
noncontroversial
permit
takes
two
months
before
it
goes
into
effect.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
the
case
they
are
presenting
to
this
court.
we
do
not
believe
that
in
fact
that
case
even
arises
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
first
of
all,
remember
the
ninth
circuit
--
before
the
ninth
circuit
was
never
an
issue
as
to
what
type
of
a
hearing
should
be
held.
no
hearing
was
held.
so
it
wasn't
a
question
of
should
this
be
a
legislative-type
hearing
or
an
adjudicatory-type
hearing.
it
is
just
a
question
as
to
whether
any
type
of
hearing
should
have
been
held.
we
argue
that
there
was
substantial
public
interest
in
this
matter,
it
was
well
known
the
administrator
had
filed
--
the
regional
administrator
had
filed
an
affidavit
under
penalty
of
perjury
saying
it
was
controversial
and
that
the
legislative-type
hearing
should
have
been
held.
the
epa
says,
"well,
if
nobody
asks
for
a
hearing,
then
that
means
there
is
no
public
interest."
we
pointed
out
that
epa's
public
participation
regulations
which
apply
to
the
npdes
permit,
and
which
the
epa
entirely
ignores
in
this
lawsuit,
require
that
a
hearing
be
held
not
only
if
there
is
significant
public
interest
but
also
if
there
is
pertinent
information
to
be
gained.
clearly
there
is
pertinent
information
to
be
gained
here,
and
the
ninth
circuit
so
held.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
right.
the
epa
wants
you
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
so
that
the
stay
will
be
lifted
and
so
that
their
interpretation
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
that
it
requires
them
to
conduct
an
adjudicatory
hearing
will
be
off
the
book.
we
don't
believe
the
ninth
circuit
decision
requires
them
to
conduct
as
adjudicatory
hearing
in
all
cases.
the
general
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
goes
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case
is
limited
to
the
statement
that
under
section
402
of
the
water
act,
considering
the
legislative
history
about
using
these
hearings
for
public
participation
and
involvement
of
citizens,
when
a
hearing
is
not
held
under
section
402
and
it
is
challenged,
the
environmental
protection
agency
must
present
some
kind
of
a
record
--
some
kind
of
a
record
to
the
court
to
justify
that
there
was
no
reason
for
a
hearing,
preferably
by
showing
that
none
of
the
facts
upon
which
the
decision
rest
are
in
dispute.
that
is
the
general
holding.
mr.
robert
k.
best
resolved
before
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
correct.
no
one
asked
for
the
legislative-type
hearing,
because
we
received
no
notice
that
the
legislative--type
hearing
was
under
way.
we
did
ask
--
mr.
kilroy
asked
for
an
adjudicatory--type
hearing.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
remand
language,
mr.
justice
white,
says
"proper
hearing."
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
epa
did
not
conduct
a
legislative-type
hearing.
when
you
read
the
beginning
of
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
court
does
use
that
language.
i
would
point
out
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
but
here
the
adjudicatory
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
we
certainly
do,
and
i
will
explain
why.
an
adjudicatory
hearing
was
requested
--
mr.
justice
white,
an
adjudicatory
hearing
was
requested
and
so
if
the
court
found
that
the
request
was
raised
was
adequate,
then
epa
was
obligated
to
give
an
adjudicatory
hearing;
and
since
the
request
was
on
file.
the
beginning
of
this
section
--
if
you
read
the
beginning
of
this
section
where
the
court
analyzes
the
question
about
-
can
we
order
a
hearing
when
there
has
been
no
request?
should
there
have
been
a
hearing
held
before
the
june
2
decision?
these
are
the
questions
the
court
addresses.
that
applies
to
the
legislative
hearing,
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
adjudicatory
hearing.
only
the
legislative
hearing
is
held
before
the
june
decision.
only
the
legislative
hearing
was
there
no
requests
submitted.
and
so
we
believe
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
saying
is
essentially
it
followed
the
flow
of
the
case.
it
said,
let's
look
at
the
legislative
hearing.
can
we
order
a
legislative
hearing
where
there
has
been
no
hearing
requested?
and
it
concluded
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
facts
that
no
hearing
was
requested
was
insufficient.
and
it
went
on
and
discussed
an
adjudicatory
hearing
and
concluded
that
likewise
--
in
the
language
of
the
court
--
"a
hearing
after
an
adjudicatory
hearing
is
better
than
no
hearing
at
all."
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
status
of
the
case
a
couple
of
months
from
now,
i
would
certainly
hope
that
it
would
be
moot,
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
will
start
it
procedures
to
issue
a
new
permit.
i
cannot
say
what
epa
will
do.
mr.
robert
k.
best
yes,
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
to
emphasize
that
under
section
558
of
the
apa
this
permit
remains
in
effect
as
long
as
the
city
of
los
angeles
has
filed
an
application
for
a
new
permit
and
the
epa
has
not
acted.
and
so
by
just
not
acting,
epa
will
extend
this
permit
for
as
long
as
--
until
the
city
decides
to
mandate
it.
mr.
robert
k.
best
it
is
subject
to
a
stay
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
if
this
court
were
to
remand
for
mootness,
we
would
lose
that
stay.
mr.
robert
k.
best
well,
i
would
hope
that
if
the
decision
goes
against
us,
that
it
would
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
reconsider
in
light
of
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
permit
will
not
expire
until
a
new
permit
is
issued.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
right.
they
should
have
started
over
six
months
ago.
mr.
robert
k.
best
they
maintained
to
us
that
that
is
what
they
--
why
they
are
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
right,
that
they
were
not
taking
action
on
this
permit
until
they
know
what
is
required.
mr.
robert
k.
best
if
you
decide
for
us,
then
we
will
go
back
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
ask
them
to
start
the
proceedings
on
the
new
permit.
we
are
not
interested
in
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
well,
quite
honestly
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
our
position
is
that
the
epa's
procedures
as
put
out
in
its
original
regulations,
the
regulations
which
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this,
were
adequate.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
invalidate
any
of
those
regulations.
we
maintained
that
we
complied
with
those
regulations
and
that
therefore
we
should
have
had
a
hearing.
we
maintained
that
those
regulations
required
epa
to
conduct
the
legislative
hearings.
now,
we
have
serious
reservations
about
the
adequacy
of
the
new
regulations
relating
to
adjudicatory
hearings,
because
they
are
much
more
onerous
than
the
old
ones.
but
that
is
not
at
issue.
mr.
robert
k.
best
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
not.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
deliberately
used
the
adjective
"proper"
instead
of
the
adjective
"adjudicatory"
and
it
remanded
it
for
a
proper
hearing.
remember,
the
court
says
in
its
opinion
that
if
it
were
presented
with
an
adequate
record
demonstrating
that
what
had
been
done
was
proper,
it
would
have
to
reconsider
its
decision
that
it
was
not
--
that
the
opportunity
for
hearing
had
not
been
given.
and
it
did
not
say
what
that
record
need
to
be.
mr.
robert
k.
best
we
believe
it
means
a
hearing
as
required
by
epa's
regulations.
mr.
robert
k.
best
there
are
two
kinds
of
hearings.
mr.
robert
k.
best
we
believe
that
it
means
start
over
again
with
the
legislative-type
hearing,
because
the
hearing
in
epa's
context
is
a
two-step
process.
much
like
section
554
of
the
apa,
the
adjudicatory
provision
of
the
apa
lays
out
a
two-step
process.
first,
you
have
an
informal
addressing
of
the
issues,
where
you
present
your
complaint
and
you
try
to
resolve
it.
if
that
is
unsatisfactory
and
you
are
unable
to
resolve
your
differences,
then
you
go
forward
to
a
formal.
we
believe
that
in
essence
that
is
the
hearing
concept
within
section
402
as
epa's
regulations
defined
it.
so
a
"proper"
hearing
requires
that
epa
go
back
and
start
with
the
informal
resolution
process,
in
other
words
the
legislative-type
hearing.
and
if
we
can
resolve
our
differences
there,
the
case
would
end
there.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
a
term
that
was
adopted
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
in
their
brief
to
describe
the
initial
hearing
which
they
hold
without
going
through
the
adjudicatory
provisions.
it
is
a
non-adversary
hearing
that
you
start
out.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
interim
sludge
disposal
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
permit
itself,
except
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
well,
unfortunately
this
is
one
of
the
issues
that
we
wish
to
address
in
the
adjudicatory
hearing.
the
dates
are
all
passed.
the
dates
by
which
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
passed.
mr.
robert
k.
best
when
epa
took
its
action
on
june
2
and
extended
the
permit,
the
dates
in
epa's
permit
were
already
missed,
they
were
already
in
the
past.
and
that
was
one
of
our
complaints,
how
do
we
know
when
this
thing
is
going
to
be
implemented
or
how
when
you
are
extending
a
permit
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
well
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
requirement
to
initiate
the
project
was
supposedly
triggered
by
what
is
called
"concept
approval."
again,
i
would
point
out
epa
has
never
given
concept
approval.
what
was
given
was
a
concept
approval
by
the
state
board.
that
is
a
non-ministerial
action.
mr.
robert
k.
best
we
pointed
that
out
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
has
been
one
of
our
arguments,
the
epa
says
the
state
board
gave
--
the
complaint
against
the
city
of
los
angeles
alleges
that
concept
approval
was
given
and
refers
to
the
state
board
action
as
starting
concept
approval.
then
i
believe
that
by
the
implementation
of
the
dates
that
the
--
it
was
april
1,
1980
when
the
full
project
had
to
be
implemented.
it
was
staged,
it
was
implemented
and
staged.
i
believe
april
1,
1980
was
the
final
date
for
it
to
be
fully
implemented,
given
the
date
of
concept
approval.
mr.
robert
k.
best
if
before
the
supreme
court
no
petition
--
mr.
robert
k.
best
in
the
courts
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
or
in
this
court?
mr.
robert
k.
best
i
believe
in
that
case
what
would
have
happened
is
that
epa
would
have
started
over
again
with
a
new
permit
for
los
angeles
and
we
would
be
operating
under
a
new
permit.
mr.
robert
k.
best
some
months
ago.
i
only
have
a
few
seconds
and
if
i
may
make
one
final
point,
i
would
like
to
urge
the
court
to
remember
the
public
participation
requirements
of
the
act.
this
is
a
major
permit
--
the
city
of
los
angeles'
permit
--
in
a
major
urban
area
that
was
issued
for
a
2-1/2-year
period,
with
absolutely
no
public
participation;
in
fact
with
steps
that
deliberately
precluded
public
participation.
we
need
the
hearing
to
address
these
issues
about
this
very
unsatisfactory
project.
i
thank
you.
