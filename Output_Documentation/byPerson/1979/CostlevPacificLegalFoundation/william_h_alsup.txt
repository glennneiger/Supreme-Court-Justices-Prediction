mr.
william
h.
alsup
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
"opportunity
for
public
hearing"
in
section
402(a)
of
the
clean
water
act
and
the
extent
to
which
the
environmental
protection
agency
may
condition
the
availability
of
an
adjudicatory
hearing
on
the
submission
of
a
prior
request
for
such
a
hearing
setting
forth
a
material
issue
of
fact.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
certainly
i
would
be
happy
to
address
that
now.
we
do
believe
there
is
a
continuing
controversy.
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
follow
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
is
there
some
particular
reason
that
you
might
believe
that
the
case
is
no
longer
a
live
controversy?
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
it
is
true
that
the
original
permit
was
granted,
or
extended
in
the
action
in
question
through
december
17
of
this
year.
but
the
case
would
not
become
moot
even
if
this
court
were
to
rule
on
the
case
sometime
in
the
spring
or
next
year,
because
there
is
a
pending
application
for
an
additional
permit
by
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
by
operation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
--
i
believe
it
is
section
558(c)
--
that
application
as
long
as
the
agency
does
not
act
on
the
pending
application
would
extend
by
operation
of
law
the
expiration
date
in
the
existing
permit.
so
therefore
if
the
court,
for
example,
were
to
rule
one
way
or
the
other
in
april
of
next
year
and
the
agency
in
the
summer
of
next
year
were
to
issue
a
--
act
on
the
pending
application
and
issue
a
new
permit,
the
old
permit
at
that
point
would
expire
by
operation
of
law
and
not
on
december
17
of
this
month.
there
is
an
additional
reason
why,
it
occurs
to
me,
why
the
case
would
not
be
moot.
and
that
is
because
the
terms
and
conditions
of
this
permit
are
the
subject
of
an
enforcement
action
in
another
lawsuit
pending
against
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
the
district
court
in
los
angeles.
and
because
of
the
preclusion
clause
in
section
509
of
the
water
act,
the
only
means
of
determining
the
validity
of
the
terms
and
conditions
that
are
sought
to
be
enforced
are
through
a
pre-enforcement
review
suit
such
as
the
one
at
issue
in
this
litigation.
the
case
arises
on
the
following
facts.
for
several
years
the
municipal
sewage
system
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
has
discharged
treated
sewage
into
santa
monica
bay.
most
of
that
sewage
has
only
received
primary
treatment,
that
is
a
process
by
which
the
heavy
solids
sink
to
the
bottom;
and
some
30
percent
has
received
secondary
treatment,
which
is
an
additional
step
which
removes
some
of
the
chemical
oxygen
demand
materials
and
suspended
solids
from
the
sewage.
this
process
results
in
two
end
products.
one
of
these
is
effluent
--
liquid
effluent
--
and
the
city
pumps
that
into
santa
monica
bay
through
a
pipe
that
is
five
miles
long.
the
second
product
is
a
muddy
substance,
liquidy
substance
called
sludge
and
that
is
pumped
into
santa
monica
bay
through
a
different
pipe.
that
one
is
seven
miles
long.
now,
under
the
clean
water
act
it
is
unlawful
to
pump
these
materials
into
santa
monica
bay
without
a
permit
called
a
npdes
permit
--
national
pollution
discharge
elimination
system
permit
--
which
is
set
up
the
scheme
in
section
402
of
the
act.
now,
although
section
402
allows
the
states
to
operate
their
own
npdes
program,
that
doesn't
apply
for
discharges
beyond
the
three-mile
limit.
so
only
the
environmental
protection
agency
may
issue
permits
for
the
five-
and
the
seven-mile
outfalls
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
also
a
one-mile
outfall
at
this
plant
called
the
hyperion
plant
in
los
angeles
and
for
that
one-mile
outfall,
because
it
falls
within
the
three-mile
limit,
the
state
issues
an
npdes
permit.
now,
on
august
18,
1975
the
epa
issued
such
a
permit
for
the
five-
and
the
seven-mile
outfalls.
and
the
state
water
quality
board
issued
a
permit
for
the
one-mile
outfall.
these
were
combined
into
a
single
document
that
received
two
numbers
-
a
federal
permit
number
and
a
state
permit
number.
this
document,
this
permit
contains
several
compliance
schedules
which
are
designed
as
timetables
to
eventually
get
the
polluter
to
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
and
there
are
two
of
those
compliance
schedules
that
have
been
disputed
in
this
case.
one
of
those
compliance
schedules
governs
the
five-mile
pipe
through
which
the
city
pumps
the
effluent
and
it
requires
that
100-percent
secondary
treatment
of
all
the
effluent
through
that
pipe
eventually
be
attained
rather
than
the
30
percent
that
it
now
achieves.
the
second
compliance
schedule
in
this
case
is
the
so-called
sludge
out
schedule.
that
one
pertains
to
the
seven-mile
outfall
and
that
schedule
requires
the
city
of
los
angeles
to
phase
out
completely
its
discharge
of
sludge
through
that
seven-mile
outfall
in
santa
monica
bay.
now,
with
that
background,
the
immediate
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
procedure
used
by
epa
to
implement
the
phrase
"opportunity
for
public
hearing"
in
section
402
which
provides
that
the
administrator
may,
after
opportunity
for
public
hearing,
issue
a
permit
for
the
discharge
of
any
pollutant
upon
the
condition
that
it
meet
a
number
of
statutory
requirements.
now,
in
1974
epa
published
regulations
that
defined
in
detail
how
a
person
could
go
about
getting
various
types
of
public
hearings
and
the
regulations,
which
are
set
forth
at
part
--
140(c)
of
part
125,
describe
three
basic
kinds
of
hearings.
first,
there
is
a
public
legislative-type
hearing
at
which
the
public
can
come
and
make
oral
arguments
or
written
presentations
on
how
they
feel
about
the
proposed
action
by
epa
in
either
granting
or
denying
a
request
for
a
permit.
the
second
is
called
an
adjudicatory
hearing.
that
is
a
trial-type
hearing
at
which
evidence
is
received
and
findings
are
made.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
they
are
analogous
to
rule-making
versus
adjudication
under
the
apa.
but
we
do
take
the
position
that
adjudication
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
precisely
the
types
of
adjudication
under
the
apa
or,
for
that
matter,
that
rule-making
would
--
although
we
don't
reach
that
question
in
this
case
--
but
that
the
public
legislative-type
hearing
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
follow
sections
556
and
557
of
the
apa
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
generally
correct,
but
there
is
some
similarity
in
this
sense
that
both
of
these
hearings
are
directed
to
whether
or
not
a
license
should
be
issued.
and
in
that
sense
there
is
--
even
at
public
hearing
--
a
specific
concrete
action
before
the
house.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
think
that
is
correct.
then
there
is
a
third
type
of
hearing
--
although
the
regulations
don't
call
it
a
hearing
--
and
that
is
where
if
someone
had
a
legal
objection
to
the
issuance
of
a
permit,
that
legal
objection
could
be
referred
to
the
general
counsel
of
the
agency,
the
parties
would
have
an
opportunity
to
submit
briefs;
and
although
there
wouldn't
be
an
oral
argument
or
evidence
received,
the
agency
through
the
general
counsel
would
still
determine,
or
make
a
ruling,
on
that
statutory
or
legal
objection.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
was
saying
before
the
recess,
the
regulations
promulgated
in
1974
provided
for
basically
three
types
of
hearings
-
the
public
legislative-type
hearing,
the
adjudicatory
hearing
and
the
procedure
by
which
legal
objections
could
be
determined
by
general
counsel.
the
regulations
also
imposed
threshold
requirements
for
each
of
these
type
hearings.
the
public
legislative-type
hearing
would
only
be
held
if,
after
giving
public
notice
of
what
the
epa
intended
to
do,
the
regional
administrator
determined
that
there
was
significant
public
interest
in
the
proposed
action.
the
adjudicatory
hearing
would
be
held
only
if
someone
presented
a
question
--
not
just
someone,
but
an
interested
party
presented
a
request
for
an
adjudicatory
hearing
that
set
forth
a
material
issue
of
fact.
and
the
regulations
were
quite
specific
on
that,
they
said
the
request
to
be
denied,
and
must
be
denied,
if
no
such
requests
presenting
a
material
issue
of
fact
were
filed.
and
then
finally
the
only
requirement
for
getting
a
legal
determination
was
that
someone
submit
a
request
stating
an
objection
based
on
legal
grounds
to
proposed
course
of
action.
in
the
present
case,
when
the
1975
permit
was
issued
--
on
august
18
of
1975
--
the
epa
announced
its
proposed
action
of
issuing
the
permit
to
the
city
of
los
angeles.
it
gave
notice
--
public
notice
--
held
a
public
hearing
and
then
issued
a
permit.
that
is
the
permit
that
i
described
a
moment
ago
containing
the
compliance
schedules.
no
one
at
that
time
sought
review
under
section
509
of
the
act
to
have
that
action
set
aside.
similarly,
when
that
permit
expired
by
its
own
terms
in
early
1977,
the
agency
went
through
that
same
procedure
-
held
a
public
hearing,
received
comments
at
that
hearing,
extended
the
permit
for
six
months
through
june
30,
1977
with
no
other
modification
other
than
simply
extending
the
expiration
date
of
the
permit.
once
again,
no
one
challenged
that
action.
then,
on
april
27,
1977,
epa
announced,
and
this
was
looking
forward
to
the
june
30
deadline
when
the
permit
would
expire
again,
epa
announced
that
it
proposed
to
extend
the
permit
once
again,
this
time
to
december
17
of
this
year.
the
agency
made
this
announcement
by
publishing
in
the
los
angeles
times
on
april
27
a
statement
saying
what
it
proposed
to
do,
saying
that
requests
--
invited
the
public
to
file
requests
for
the
public-type
hearing
and
stated
that
one
would
be
held
if
there
were
significant
public
interest
in
the
action.
and,
in
addition,
stated
that
there
would
also
be
an
opportunity
under
the
regulations
for
requests
for
an
adjudicatory
hearing.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
the
action
that
was
taken
on
both
occasions
was
really
to
extend
the
expiration
date
of
the
permit
itself.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
it
did
not
not
modify
in
any
the
compliance
schedule
deadline
dates
that
were
in
the
original
permit
in
1975.
now,
it
is
true
that
los
angeles
believes
that
epa
somehow
acquiesced
in
the
state
schedule
for
compliance
which
was
extended
by
the
state,
we
believe
that
los
angeles
is
in
error
on
that
and
that
epa
never
acquiesced
in
and
never
modified
its
own
compliance
schedule
to
achieve
the
so-called
ultimate
sludge
out.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
i
don't
think
it
would,
in
one
sense;
and,
that
is
because
by
law
the
city
must
have
one
of
these
permits.
otherwise,
they
have
to
discontinue
discharging
altogether.
so,
in
a
sense,
they
are
really
not
complaining
about
the
existence
of
the
permit
but
rather
the
conditions,
the
compliance
schedule
that
was
imposed
in
that
permit.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
actually
think
they
are
saying
much
more
than
that.
their
basic
position
seems
to
be
as
does
blf's
and
kilroy's
that
the
compliance
schedule
should
be
eliminated
altogether
because
there
is
no
environmental
harm
in
pumping
that
sludge
into
the
ocean;
and
that
there
should
be
no
compliance
schedule
at
all
but
rather
what
epa
should
do
is
set
some
maximum
effluent
level
that
could
be
perpetually
achieved
by
the
city
by
continuing
to
pump
forever
into
the
ocean.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
absolutely
right,
they
could
have
taken
that
position.
they
did
not.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
and
i
have
to
say
i
don't
think
they
took
that
position
even
in
the
extension
that
occurred
in
june
of
1977,
although
they
had
taken
that
position
in
correspondence
with
the
agency
concerning
a
grant
to
the
city
to
assist
it
in
its
waste
water
treatment.
well,
again,
no
one
commented
on
this
april
27
notice,
no
one
requested
a
public
legislative-type
hearing;
even
the
city
of
los
angeles,
and
a
personal
copy
was
mailed
to
them
of
this
proposed
action.
and
so
on
june
2,
1977
the
regional
administrator
determined
to
go
ahead
and
extend
the
permit
with
the
compliance
schedules
intact
as
before.
now,
that
action
triggered
the
ten-day
period
within
which
someone
could
file
a
request
for
an
adjudicatory
hearing
and
on
june
--
that
is
under
the
regulations
--
and
on
june
13,
mr.
kilroy
did;
he
filed
it,
being
represented
by
the
pacific
legal
foundation.
as
i
mentioned
though,
the
regulations
require
that
any
such
requests
set
forth
a
material
issue
of
fact
if
you
want
to
have
a
trial-type
hearing.
that
is
section
125.36(c).
the
regional
administrator
looked
at
the
request
and
concluded
that
it
only
raised
legal
issues
and
so
advised
pacific
legal
foundation
and
said
"you
don't
raise
factual
issues,
you
raise
legal
issues.
i
am
referring
your
legal
issues
to
our
third
procedure,
that
is
the
general
counsel
will
now
determine
the
validity
of
your
legal
objections."
and
the
pacific
legal
foundation
on
behalf
of
kilroy
was
asked
to
file
a
brief
on
those
issues.
and
pacific
legal
foundation
did
and
said,
"these
are
the
issues
that
we
plan
to
raise
and
we
meant
to
raise;
and
it
is
clear
from
that
brief
which
is
in
the
record
that
those
were
not
factual
issues,
those
were
purely
legal
issues."
now,
the
general
counsel
than
ruled
against
blf,
and
that
should
have
been
the
end
of
the
case,
in
our
view.
however,
it
wasn't.
pacific
legal
foundation,
kilroy,
the
city
of
los
angeles,
and
now
the
city
of
torrance,
which
is
a
neighbor
to
los
angeles,
filed
petitions
for
review
under
section
509
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
epa.
it
didn't
question
the
general
counsel's
treatment
of
the
legal
issues,
which
were
the
only
issues
ever
tendered
to
the
agency.
that
somehow
never
was
addressed.
rather,
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
sludge
out
schedule,
that
is
the
one
that
applies
to
that
seven-mile
pipe,
and
said
"you
can't
enforce
that
any
more
because
you,
epa,
did
not
provide
an
adjudicatory
hearing."
mr.
william
h.
alsup
no.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
there
were
many
arguments
urged
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
drift
of
that
argument
was
probably
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit,
not
specifically
though,
but
i
think
that
it
was.
and
our
position
on
that
was
well,
no
request
setting
forth
any
material
issue
of
fact
was
filed
with
the
agency.
and
that
is
why
we
didn't
hold
an
adjudicatory
hearing.
and
here
is
the
interesting
way
that
the
ninth
circuit
got
around
that
problem.
they
said,
the
ninth
circuit
said
"well,
this
opportunity
for
public
hearing
contemplates
that
you
must
routinely
hold
an
adjudicatory
hearing
even
if
no
one
requests
one,
unless
the
epa
is
prepared
to
show
on
judicial
review
that
its
decision
rests
upon
facts
about
which
there
could
be
no
plausible
factual
dispute."
this
is
a
pretty
onerous
burden
because
it
would
permit
--
and
i
would
like
to
explain
later
--
a
complete
stranger
to
the
proceedings
to
walk
into
the
ninth
circuit
and
say,
"they
didn't
hold
an
adjudicatory
hearing
and
i
have
now
identified
a
factual
issue
that
i
think
is
in
dispute."
mr.
william
h.
alsup
by
--
mr.
william
h.
alsup
by
filing
a
petition
under
section
509
within
i
believe
it
is
90
days
of
the
time
that
the
final
action
is
taken.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
just
as
the
city
of
torrance
did
in
this
case,
a
complete
stranger
to
the
proceedings
walks
into
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
he
acts
as
any
interested
person
may
seek
review.
the
city
of
torrance
believes
that
it
is
aggrieved,
in
fairness
to
the
city,
because
the
sludge-out
schedule
they
say
will
cause
the
city
of
los
angeles
to
bury
it
in
a
land-fill
that
is
near
the
city
of
torrance.
and
i
think
that
is
the
reason
that
they
are
concerned
over
this
action.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
actually
say
that.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
think
that
is
correct.
they
might
say
--
i
believe
that
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
epa
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
get
in
there
and
dig
out
all
the
possible
factual
issues
that
might
exist.
and
then
even
if
no
one
showed
up
at
the
hearing,
to
flush
out
those
issues.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
actually
say
that
but
we
think
that
is
the
practical
implication.
in
our
view,
if
it
would
be
permissible
--
if
the
ninth
circuit
might
say,
"well
of
course
if
that
happened
you
wouldn't
have
to
hold
a
hearing
if
no
one
showed
up."
but
our
response
to
that
is
-
well,
if
that
is
true,
then
why
should
we
be
required
to
hold
a
hearing
at
all
if
no
one
bothers
to
even
request
one?
we
don't
think
that
those
are
substantially
greater
burdens
to
place
on
the
public.
well,
our
basic
disagreement
with
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
the
phrase
"opportunity
for
public
hearing"
does
not
prohibit
the
agency
from
imposing
reasonable
threshold
requirements
on
the
availability
of
a
hearing.
and
barring
at
the
threshold
those
people
who
don't
satisfy
those
threshold
requirements.
this
was
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
storer
case
and
the
weinberger
v.
hynson
case
and
in
the
kleppe
case,
among
others.
for
example,
in
the
storer
case
the
fcc
issued
a
rule,
the
statute
there
said
anyone
could
have
a
hearing
on
their
license;
it
seemed
to
be
mandatory.
but
in
fact
the
court
said
"no,
the
fcc
can
say
we
are
not
going
to
issue
a
license
to
someone
who
already
owns
more
than
x
number
of
radio
stations,
so
that
those
people
would
just
be
barred
at
the
threshold."
and
the
court
went
further
to
say
that
the
fcc
would
entertain
waivers
of
that
policy;
but
it
would
only
entertain
waivers
and
they
still
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
unless
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
application
for
waiver
were
sufficient,
if
true,
to
warrant
a
waiver
in
the
opinion
of
the
fcc.
in
the
kleppe
case,
which
involved
an
act
under
which
coal
operators
were
assessed
with
fines,
the
statute
there
said,
just
like
it
does
here,
"opportunity
for
public
hearing
before
those
fines
are
assessed."
but
this
court
held,
no,
the
agency
can
issue
a
regulation
saying
that
you
have
to
request
that
hearing.
and
if
you
don't
request
the
hearing,
then
it
is
deemed
to
be
waived.
and
we
have
almost
an
identical-type
regulation
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
use
then
that
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
requirement
for
an
adjudicatory
hearing
--
that
is
set
forth
a
material
issue
of
fact
--
is
one
which
is
a
reasonable
threshold
requirement
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
we
think
it
is,
for
this
reason,
if
it
is
not
a
factual
issue,
then
there
is
no
need
for
evidence
or
an
evidentiary
hearing.
if
it
is
not
a
material
issue,
then
there
is
no
need
to
consider
it
anyway.
and
if
there
is
no
request
made,
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
people
have
no
factual
objection
to
the
course
of
action
that
the
agency
proposes
to
take.
the
second
basic
objection
that
we
have
is
that
this
imposes
an
onerous
burden
on
epa.
now,
of
course
if
the
statute
calls
for
it,
then
we
have
to
live
with
it.
but
in
the
du
pont
case,
du
pont
v.
train,
this
court
construing
the
very
same
statute
said
that
it
would
be
reluctant
to
construe
the
clean
water
act
to
impose
an
onerous
burden
on
the
agency,
because
it
would
be
hard
to
believe
that
congress
intended
such
a
burden
to
be
imposed.
this
is
very
analogous
to
what
would
happen
here.
each
year
the
agency
issued
about
2200
of
these
permits
but
in
the
past
only
about
100
adjudicatory
hearings
have
been
held.
under
the
practical
implication
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
the
agency
in
most
cases
would
now
begin
to
hold
hearings
not
in
just
100
but
in
close
to
2200
cases
a
year.
because
if
we
didn't
do
that,
we
would
have
to
bear
what
the
ninth
circuit
called
"a
very
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
a
hearing
would
have
served
absolutely
no
purpose."
so
that
the
practical
thing
to
do
to
avoid
that
problem
would
simply
be
to
hold
one
of
these
hearings,
receive
evidence,
if
the
ninth
circuit
eventually
required
that,
rather
than
to
do
what
we
do
now;
and
that
is
simply
to
see
if
anyone
requests
one
on
a
material
issue
of
fact.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
rebuttal,
with
the
court's
permission.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
try
to
address
this
question
of
whether
or
not
the
case
will
become
moot
and
whether
anything
rides
upon
this
proceeding
in
this
court.
a
very
lot
--
a
great
deal
rides
upon
whether
or
not
this
permit
is
enforceable
or
not.
there
is
now
pending
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
the
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
an
enforcement
action
brought
by
the
united
states
by
the
epa
to
enforce
this
very
compliance
schedule.
however,
the
ninth
circuit
has
stayed
that
enforcement
action,
pending
the
resolution
of
this
case.
if
this
court
were
tomorrow
to
rule
in
our
favor,
that
stay
would
be
lifted
and
our
enforcement
action
against
the
city
of
los
angeles
would
proceed
immediately.
and
what
we
are
trying
to
do
in
that
case
is
to
have
the
city
comply
with
the
condition
in
the
permit
that
required
by
april
of
1980
for
the
city
to
discontinue
putting
sludge
in
the
ocean.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
why
the
ninth
circuit
did
that.
but
the
order
does
read
"pending
final
resolution
of
this
litigation."
and
i
suppose
what
motivated
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
they
knew
that
the
government
was
attempting
to
enforce
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
permit
that
had
been
extended.
and
since
the
ninth
circuit
had
declared
that
to
be
an
illegal
action,
that
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
it
was
best
not
to
allow
the
government
to
continue
to
enforce
it.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
i
suppose
what
the
ninth
circuit
contemplated
was
that
if
our
petition
were
not
granted
or
we
lost
in
this
court,
that
then
the
enforcement
action
would
be
permanently
enjoined.
i
think
that
is
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
well,
that
is
correct;
but
you
know
that
is
only
one-half
of
the
possible
outcomes.
the
other
one-half
of
the
outcome
is
that
tomorrow
or
reasonably
soon
--
even
february
or
march
--
this
court
were
to
affirm
what
epa
did
and
then
our
enforcement
action
would
proceed,
the
stay
would
be
lifted
and
we
would
then
be
able
to
have
enforced
the
permit
that
now
exists
and
the
conditions
in
that
permit,
rather
than
wait
until
the
entire
administrative
process
goes
through
it
again.
now,
this
permit
does
not
expire
on
the
17th.
that
is
by
operation
of
section
558(c)
of
title
v
which
provides
that
so
long
as
there
is
a
timely
application
for
renewal
the
permit
or
license
in
existence
continues
by
operation
of
law
to
remain
in
effect.
so,
for
example,
if
--
i
should
say
that
these
are
complicated,
it
has
been
complicated
by
the
1977
amendments
which
allow
under
section
301(h)
an
additional
application
to
be
made
by
the
city.
it
is
quite
lengthy.
they
have
made
that
application,
a
lot
of
other
cities
have
made
those
301(h)
applications,
and
not
a
one
of
them
has
been
acted
on
yet
because
of
the
scientific
review
that
is
necessary.
it
may
be
many
months
before
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
able
to
act
on
the
pending
applications
for
renewal.
by
virtue
of
558(c),
in
the
meantime
--
which
could
be
as
many
as
11
or
12
months
--
the
existing
permit
does
not
expire.
and
that
is
the
reason
this
case
has
not
become
moot.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
absolutely;
in
our
view.
now,
the
city
resists
that
view
and
that
is
part
of
the
litigation
in
los
angeles.
but
our
position
in
that
enforcement
action
in
los
angeles
is
that
concept
approval,
true,
was
given
by
the
state,
but
that
nonetheless
triggered
the
compliance
schedule
that
is
at
page
18
of
the
appendix
and
required,
many
months
ago,
for
the
city
to
start
phasing
out
putting
the
sludge
in
the
ocean
and
putting
it
somewhere
else.
and
by
april
of
1980,
it
was
originally
contemplated
that
that
process
would
be
complete.
now
it
is
way
behind
schedule
because
the
city
has
fought
us
on
this.
but,
nonetheless,
it
is
our
position
that
the
compliance
schedule
in
the
permit
is
already
operative
and
they
are
in
violation
of
that
compliance
schedule.
mr.
william
h.
alsup
the
latter
is
our
basic
position.
the
permit
simply
says
whatever
you
do
with
it,
you
can't
put
it
in
the
ocean.
and,
the
city,
you
can
come
up
with
your
own
scheme.
the
city
did
come
up
with
its
own
scheme
and
it
is
called
the
interim
sludge
project.
they
decided
to
put
it
in
landfills.
it
gets
a
bit
complicated,
because
then
they
came
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
said
"would
you
help
us
fund
this
project"?
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
epa
said
"yes,
we
will
consider
funding
your
project."
and
so
the
epa
is
in
fact
involved
on
the
funding
side
of
approving
the
so-called
interim
sludge
project.
but
had
there
never
been
any
funding,
the
permit
by
its
own
terms
would
have
said
whatever
you
do
with
it,
you
cannot
continue
to
put
it
in
the
ocean
after
april
1980.
thank
you.
