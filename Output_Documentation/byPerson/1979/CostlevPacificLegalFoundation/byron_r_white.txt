mr.
alsup,
could
i
interrupt
there,
because
i
have
some
difficulty,
frankly,
understanding
the
city
of
los
angeles'
position
in
the
case.
what
did
you
do,
just
extend
the
date
by
which
the
changes
had
to
be
made,
the
sludge
out
and
the
improvement
on
the
liquid?
is
that
all
that
happened,
it
gave
los
angeles
more
time
to
comply?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
quite
really
haven't
been
able
to
understand
how
just
merely
extending
the
termination
date
of
the
permit,
how
could
that
adversely
affect
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
any
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
saying
that
the
federal
permit
should
have
been
modified
to
follow
the
state
schedule.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
position
they
could
have
taken
back
in
--
when
the
original
august
18,
'75
permit
was
issued,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
could
have
taken
it
again
in
january
of
'77,
and
they
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
must
have
been
urged
by
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
a
party
aggrieved,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
the
ninth
circuit
would
say
that
if
you
scheduled
an
adjudicatory
hearing
and
some
people
had
notice
and
didn't
show
up,
they
would
be
bound
by
your
resolution,
whatever
possible
factual
issues
there
may
be
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
consistent
with
their
theory
they
could
say,
no,
they
wouldn't
be
bound.
justice
byron
r.
white
imagine
you
had
an
enemy
--
imagine
you
had
an
opponent,
and
go
at
it
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
hearing
scheduled;
how
long
after
was
it
until
there
was
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
submitted
a
request
for
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
requested
that
you,
posed
legal
issues,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
ordered.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court's
language
is
that
it
was
unable
to
deny
an
adjudicatory
hearing
on
the
ground
that
none
of
the
material
facts
upon
epa's
decision
rests
are
disputed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
could
comply
with
the
remand
order
if
an
adjudicatory
hearing
was
not
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
listen
to
this
argument
and
we
take
the
case
under
submission.
what
would
be
the
status
of
the
case
a
couple
of
months
from
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
leadtime
did
the
permit
purport
to
allow?
how
much
time
was
there
between
the
entry
of
the
order
that
told
los
angeles
to
get
started
and
the
time
they
were
supposed
to
get
started?
justice
byron
r.
white
ujust
approximately.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
epa
has
not
given
concept
approval
and
if
that
is
what
triggers
it,
then
i
would
suppose
there
is
no
outstanding
requirement
that
they
start.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
the
federal
government's
responsibility
to
approve
of
where
the
sludge
is
taken,
or
is
it
merely
the
federal
government's
position
that
it
can
no
longer
go
in
the
ocean?
