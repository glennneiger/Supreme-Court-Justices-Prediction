justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
has
to
do
with
los
angeles
discharged
of
its
sewage
into
the
pacific
ocean.
under
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
amendments
of
1972,
the
environmental
protection
agency,
upon
specified
conditions
may
issue
a
permit
for
the
discharge
of
pollutants.
the
permit
in
fact
was
issued
to
the
city.
the
case
centers,
however,
on
the
ultimate
termination
of
the
pacific
ocean
discharge
and
the
possible
alternative
deposit
of
sludge
in
a
landfill
site.
the
issue
was
essentially
one
of
the
administrative
laws
and
it
involves
the
right
to
a
public
hearing
and
concerns
expressed
by
environmentalist
who
are
opposed
to
bringing
the
ocean
discharge
to
an
end.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
epa
was
required
to
justify
every
failure
to
hold
a
hearing
on
a
permit
action
by
proof
that
the
material
facts
supporting
the
act
and
i
quote
"are
not
subject
to
dispute."
we
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
the
reasons
for
our
disagreement
are
set
forth
at
some
length.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
