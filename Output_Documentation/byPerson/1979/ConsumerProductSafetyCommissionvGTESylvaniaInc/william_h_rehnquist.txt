justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
referring
now,
mr.
buscemi
to
the
language
of
6
(b)
(1)
itself
or
to
the
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
get
to
that,
you
concede
that
this
interpretation
is
one
of
the
so-called
skidmore
versus
swift
&
company-type
of
interpretations
where
the
commission
has
not
been
granted
the
authority
to
fill
in
blanks.
it's
simply
a
--
an
interpretation
by
the
agency
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
--
it's
not
as
if
the
--
if
congress
had
authorized
the
commission
to
define
particular
items
or
to
make
rules
and
regulations
pertaining
to
disclosure
which
would
have
taken
it
outside
of
the
swift
and
skidmore
type
of
regulation
and
into
the
--
simply,
is
it
rational
type
of
thing
where
you
--
which
you
frequently
find
where
congress
has
left
the
commission
to
the
--
left
the
commission
the
job
of
filling
in
blanks
which
it
didn't
want
to
fill
itself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
buscemi,
don't
you
think
that
in
chrysler
corporation
last
year,
we
recognized
some
difference
between
agency
materials
generated
by
the
agency
and
materials
on
the
possession
of
the
agency
which
had
been
furnished
by
outside
suppliers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
not
otherwise
exempted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
gives
the
subpoena
power.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
subpoena
power
is
what
enables
the
consumer
safety
products
commission
to
have
all
these
supplier
--
information
in
its
hands
in
order
to
respond
to
an
foia
request.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
were
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
rejected
by
the
commission
here,
were
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
segal,
on
page
52
of
your
brief,
the
last
paragraph
starts
not
surprisingly
when
the
cpsc's
“administrative
interpretation”
was
represented
to
judge
latchum
in
october
1977.
he
refused
to
accord
any
significant
way
noting
that
it
“did
not
arise
until
after
the
present
controversy
began.”
you
--
you're
suggesting
that
that
was
not
a
matter
that
had
been
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
brief
refers
to
the
commission's
“administrative
interpretation”
presented
to
judge
--
judge
latchum.
