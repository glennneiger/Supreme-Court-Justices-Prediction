mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
justice
stevens'
question
because
i'm
afraid
it
wasn't
really
answered.
and
to
do
so,
i
need
“only”
two
sentences
and
a
response
in
the
oral
argument
in
the
third
circuit.
judge
higginbotham
asked
counsel
for
the
commission.
“so
you
concede
that
it,
referring
to
all
these
material,
is
deceptive,
a
melange
of
errors
and
a
whole
series
of
other
words
which
judge
leighton
found.
he
said
it
was
deceptive,
misleading,
and
he
use
three
of
four
other
words.
mr.
mutterperl,
“we
have
not
disputed
that,
your
honor.
that's
correct.”
and
that
is
a
major
key.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
your
honors,
one
of
the
big
problems
here
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
industry
begged
the
commission
to
define
what
a
tv-related
accident
was.
it
simply
refused.
they
begged
them
to
define
what
they
meant
by
various
types
of
things
they
were
asking,
they
refused.
and
so
you
have
just
what
judge
higginbotham
described
as
a
melange
of
errors.
you
have
some
people
who
gave
tv
accidents,
where
it
happened
within
the
set,
he
went
to
some
tv
manufacturers
who
gave
it
only
if
it
went
beyond
the
set.
and
you
had
some
who
frankly
said
that
if
i
was
sitting
on
a
sofa
and
i
caused
a
fire
on
the
sofa
and
that
spread
to
the
tv,
that
was
a
tv
related
accident.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
or
if
you
suffered
a
hernia
carrying
the
set.
[laughter]
some
answered
that.
so
your
honors,
for
that
reason,
the
project
director
for
the
commission
in
testifying,
said
that
he
really
couldn't
say
that
this
was
of
any
use
to
the
public
except
for
a
general
picture
of
tvs.
he
said
you
couldn't
use
it
for
comparison
among
companies
and
the
expert
that
they
called
upon,
he
said
--
well
he
didn't
see
that
he
would
give
much
of
anything
to
the
public
in
view
of
the
character.
that's
in
the
record
and
specific,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
that
we're
given
by
the
representative
of
the
commission
disregards
all
this
which
is
a
basic
--
he
says
that
we
didn't
raise
section
6
until
very
late
with
just
an
error.
we
raised
that
as
our
first
objection
to
the
disclosure
of
the
material.
section
6
is
absolutely
categorical.
it
says
that
if
the
identity
of
the
manufacturers
to
be
closed
and
only
then,
if
that's
to
be
disclosed,
this
could
all
have
been
completely
obliterated
from
the
record
if
they
had
simply
agreed
not
to
disclose
individual
manufacturers
tied
into
individual
data.
having
admitted
that
it
wouldn't
be
any
good
for
a
comparison,
having
admitted
that
it
would
be
a
melange
of
errors
that
having
admitted
that
each
answered
in
a
different
way.
they
categorically
refused
to
put
out
the
testimony
without
disclosing
manufacturers.
have
they
done
that,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
why
they
didn't
do
it
is
beyond
me,
your
honors.
now,
the
argument
that
is
used
that
the
chief
justice
addressed
himself
to,
whether
when
the
commission
releases
information.
let
me
take
an
example,
suppose
the
new
york
times
comes
to
the
commission
and
says,
“give
us
this
material,”
and
the
commission
gives
it.
instead
the
new
york
times
goes
under
the
federal
foia
and
asks
for
the
information.
what
difference
can
there
be
in
the
public
conception
when
that
is
published?
in
this
case,
one
of
the
requesters
is
the
consumers
union,
it
publishes
the
consumers'
reports
monthly.
what
difference
will
it
make
when
it
publishes?
i've
read
it,
it
never
gives
the
source.
it
always
gives
the
facts.
it
always
would
state
this
came
from
the
commission.
what
difference
is
it
to
the
public
if
he
says,
“oh,
i
got
this
as
an
foia
requester,
or
i
got
this
by
asking
it
directly
from
the
commission.”
(voice
overlap)
the
commission
is
the
source
in
neither
event.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
indeed,
the
--
no
agency
is
permitted
to
request
that
or
require
it.
and
i
might
say
to
your
honors
as
i'm
sure
you
know
the
legal
times
of
washington,
each
week
publishes
a
whole
list
of
the
foia
requests.
in
pierce
&
stevens,
judge
feinberg
expressly
contrasted
the
industrial
nature
of
the
supplier
and
the
single
person
character
of
the
requester
who
had
a
very
appealing
case,
your
honors,
and
who
came
to
the
commission
with
not
information
supplied
by
others
but
as
a
woman
who
had
suffered,
her
house
completely
burning
down,
herself
being
injured.
and
an
examination
by
the
agency
itself
and
she
said,
“can
i
have
the
result
to
that
--
that
examination?”
it
was
a
rather
easy
case
and
judge
feinberg
said,
“well,
when
you
have
all
of
these
industrials
and
a
person
asks
for
it,
isn't
it
fair
to
give
it
to
the
person?”
i
think
he
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
most
often
--
by
the
way,
it
is
not
individuals
who
go
to
the
foia.
it's
of
course
industry,
it's
of
course
the
press,
it's
of
course
interested
parties,
it's
of
course
consumer
groups.
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
to
say
that
it
has
an
imprimatur
if
it
comes
directly
from
the
commission.
but
it
has
no
imprimatur
if
it
goes
through
the
foia
even
though
the
commission
hasn't
the
right
to
say,
“you
must
say
it
comes
through
the
foia.”
it's
in
my
mind
your
honors
simply
to
state
the
fact
that
beggars
belief.
now,
as
to
why
it
was
that
section
(6)
(b)
(1)
was
put
into
this
particular
statute,
i
must
say
to
your
honors
that
sometimes,
doubting
the
wisdom
of
congress
as
some
of
us
do
perhaps
unwisely.
this
was
one
time
when
it
acted
with
a
great
statesmanship.
what
happened?
the
commission
foresaw
that
it
would
require
for
its
particular
assignment,
it
must
remember,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
came
in
1972
when
consumerism
was
enveloping
the
nation.
and
this
was
an
endeavor
and
the
biggest
thing
the
consumers
were
asking,
“protect
the
consumer,”
by
the
congress
to
answer
that
persistent
demand
hammering
at
its
doors
with
representatives,
crowding
its
galleries.
and
the
house
report,
the
commission
studiously
avoids
going
into
the
legislative
history
and
as
our
brief
discloses
and
obviously,
i
won't
have
time
to
do
it.
the
house
reports,
the
conference
reports,
really
answer
all
of
the
questions.
for
example,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
answer
you,
there
never
have
been
regulations,
ever
issued
by
the
commission
in
the
eight
years
that
it's
been
in
existence.
they
issued
a
form
of
regulation
to
be
discussed
to
never
issue
the
regulation,
so
there
is
none.
the
congress
said
it
recognized
that
the
commission
would
need
and
now
i
quote,
“the
means
of
gaining
access,”
this
is
in
the
house
report,
“gaining
access
to
a
great
deal
of
information
which
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
the
public
or
to
government,
as
the
quid
pro
quo.”
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
no.
that
refers
to
subsequent
legislative
history
which
the
commission
endeavored.
there
was
an
act
of
little
consequence,
it
was
endeavored
to
be
able
to
incorporate
cities
into
the
act
on
someone.
and
then
undoubtedly
at
the
request
of
the
commission,
they
put
in
a
statement
that
we
intended,
the
consumer
practice
--
the
consumer
product
safety
act
to
apply
only
to
affirm
of
discloses,
only
to
their
disclosures.
it
was
an
endeavor
by
the
congress
years
after
the
act
to
say
what
had
been
meant.
now,
as
your
honors
well
know,
the
law
is
crystal
clear
as
pronounced
by
this
court
that
you
can
do
that
only
by
legislation,
you
can
do
it
only
by
a
specific
legislative
declaration.
but
a
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
congressman
says
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
commission
appeared
asking
that
this
be
incorporated
and
i
might
say
that
they
asked
for
a
specific
provision
saying
what
they
now
urging,
and
what
do
you
think
happened
to
it?
it
died
in
committee
and
anything
be
more
conclusive.
now,
to
get
back
if
you
please
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
was
represented
to
the
judge,
your
honor,
and
it's
indeed
a
late
bloomer.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
was
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
arose
years
after
the
dispute
was
in
the
court.
now,
just
to
get
back
to
what
the
legislative
history
shows
was
the
desire
under
this
act.
it
said,
“we
would
need
the
means
of
gaining
access
to
a
great
deal
of
information
which
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
the
public
or
the
government,
and
the
quid
pro
quo
for
this
was
section
6.”
and
i
again
quote,
“from
the
house
report
as
to
what
they
felt
they
gave.”
they
gave
detailed
requirements
and
limitations
relating
to
the
commission's
authority
to
disclose
information
which
it
acquired
in
the
conduct
of
its
responsibilities
under
this
act.
not
gave
only
if
it
did
it
directly,
not
gave
only
as
to
this
magic
word
affirmative,
then
say
disclosure
except
through
the
foia,
it
could
well
have
done
that.section
6
does
specifically
refer
to
the
foia.
section
6
does
specifically
refer
to
things
that
could
not
be
disclosed
and
it
was
an
amendment
to
that
that
the
commission
asked
in
1977
and
the
congress
just
wouldn't
pay
any
attention
to
it
because
that
was
completely
adverse
to
what
they
wanted.
what
they
realize
was,
that
congress
--
that
the
industry
was
unlikely
to
cooperate
and
release
all
these
vast
data
from
its
files
if
it
felt
the
commission
was
merely
a
conduit
to
the
public,
whether
by
foia
or
directly
from
the
commission.
and
second,
i
must
say
for
the
congress
that
the
debates
indicate
that
it
recognize
that
it
would
be
unfair
if
the
names
of
manufacturers,
and
i
emphasize
to
your
honors
that
section
6
(b)
(1)
does
not
apply
unless
the
name
of
the
manufacturer
is
clearly,
name
is
given
or
can
be
gleaned
from
the
information.
if
that's
not
so,
then
section
6
has
no
application
whatever.
now,
the
statutory
language
itself,
this
word
public
--
me
just
say
to
your
honors
in
a
word,
the
title
of
section
552
of
foia
is
public
information.
what
do
you
think
is
the
title
of
25
(c)
of
the
consumers
product
safety
act?
public
information,
identical.
what's
the
title
of
section
6
which
we're
discussing?
public
disclosure
of
information.
the
act
use
identical
information
how
they
can
argue
that
one
applies
and
the
other
doesn't,
really
is
a
--
certainly
beyond
the
language
of
the
act,
certainly
beyond
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
that's
categorical
on
our
brief,
again
and
again
quotes
that.
and
except
for
having
quoted
to
your
honors
what
i
think
is
the
most
important,
i
will
not
quote
the
legislative
history
any
longer
in
the
interest
of
time.
the
problem
here
is
the
interaction
of
two
statutes,
and
a
kind
of
endeavor
to
have
the
philosophies
differentiated
by
the
commission.
in
the
first
place,
that
can't
be
done
because
of
the
clear
language.
your
honors,
all
these
words
that
have
been
used
by
my
friend,
this
word
“affirmative”
that
appears
nowhere
in
the
statutes.
the
evidence
of
exclusivity
appears
nowhere
in
the
statute.
his
whole
argument
is
because
congress
hasn't
introduced
the
section
6
(b)
(1)
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
how
can
there
be
a
section
6
(b)
(1)
in
this
act?
well
it's
there.
and
why
that
congress
did
it
is
there.
and
i
might
say
to
your
honors
that
in
my
judgment
if
the
federal
trade
commission
act
had
been
passed
under
the
same
pressures
of
the
consumers
that
this
was
and
there
had
been
the
same
knowledge
that
that's
the
way
they
get
the
information.
i'm
a
practicing
lawyer
as
your
honors
know
and
let
me
tell
you,
if
not
for
section
6
(b)
(1),
when
rcas
are
advise,
and
we
said,
“give
them
everything
you
want.”
we
would've
said,
“give
them
nothing.”
then
what
would've
happened?
years
of
litigation
would've
been
sued
and
years
of
litigation
would've
been
sued
as
to
every
endeavor
by
the
commission
and
that's
what
congress
recognized
in
its
wisdom
and
that's
what
was
avoided
here.
they
got
this
--
they
got
really
everything
in
the
files
of
rca
pertaining
to
--
we
didn't
know
what,
pertains
anything
that
relate
--
remotely
related
to
it.
now,
we
could
show
if
they
are
in
conflict,
rules
of
statutory
construction,
i
could
say
to
your
honors
the
obvious
since
this
is
a
1972
act,
of
course,
it
prevails
over
in
1966
act.
i
could
say
to
your
honors
since
this
is
specific,
it
prevails
over
the
general.
but
i
have
tried
to
give
you
what
i
regard
as
really
a
very
much
more
basic
underlying
reason
for
this
act,
because
i
do
believe
that
the
consumers
are
entitled.
when
you
get
into
this
kind
of
thing,
first,
they're
entitled
to
a
different
kind
of
treatment
than
the
commission
gave
a
whole
subject.
they're
entitled
to
deliberate
consideration.
the
commission
can't
now
endeavor
to
remedy
its
errors
by
saying,
“well,
there's
no
difference.we'll
just
ask
for
it
through
the
foia
and
then
everything
will
be
cleared
up.
don't
worry
about
the
fact
that's
deceptive.
don't
worry
about
its
being
a
mélange
of
errors.
don't
worry
about
its
being
abysmally
unfair
to
the
manufacturers.
don't
worry
about
how
it
could
hurt
a
manufacturer
who
turned
overall
his
files
on
the
assumption
that
the
act
meant
what
it
said.”
if
the
commission
hadn't
done
that,
but
had
acted
here
deliberately
and
states
them,
why,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
we
wouldn't
be
here,
if
it
pleased
the
court,
if
they
had
simply
removed
the
names
of
the
manufacturers.
what
use
could
that
be
since
the
project
director
said
he
had
to
say
frankly
that
it
would
be
no
good
for
that
purpose
at
all?
it
couldn't
be
any
good
for
comparisons
among
companies,
then
why
will
you
give
names
of
companies?
just
the
kind
of
abstinency,
just
the
kind
of
adherence.
well,
this
is
foia,
so
we're
in
the
clear,
we
don't
need
to
abide
by
even
rules
of
decency.now,
the
pierce
case,
your
honors,
was
a
very
compelling
case.
the
pierce
case
was
a
case
in
which
a
woman
had
had
her
house
burned
down,
had
been
severely
injured
and
she
asked
for
the
labels
to
see
whether
the
label
on
her
bottle
was
the
same
as
the
other
labels.
and
the
commission
advised
her
or
the
department
advised
her
that
there
were
questions
about
it,
if
it
had
an
investigation
but
we
have
to
go
to
the
manufacturer.
now,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
if
that
case
hadn't
gone
the
way
it
did
and
the
information
had
been
supplied,
no
court
in
the
land
would
have
undone
or
would
have
reversed
that
action.
and
to
show
you
how
much
judge
feinberg's
emphasis
was
on
the
incident
and
not
the
law.
i
might
say
to
your
honors
with
the
greatest
of
deference
to
accord
of
which
i
hold
the
highest
regard,
i'm
sure
if
it
rereads
that
opinion,
it
would
not
want
its
standing
in
the
legal
community
to
be
determined
by
that
opinion.
that
simply
doesn't
address
the
legislative
history.
it
simply
doesn't
address
the
questions.
but
to
show
you
the
unitary
attitude,
i
just
quote
you
one
statement.
we
believe
that
in
this
statute
affecting
only
commercial
enterprises,
congress
did
not
intend
to
reduce
disclosure
called
for
by
the
fbi
when
a
person
requests
documents.
now,
a
person
requested
in
that
case,
but
the
case
applies
if
a
corporation
asked
it,
if
an
organization
asked
it,
if
the
new
york
times
asks
it.
and
somehow,
the
sympathy
for
the
case,
i'm
afraid,
overrode
the
kind
of
analysis
and
the
kind
of
opinion
that
the
second
circuit
has
become
admired
for.
now,
your
honors,
there's
a
great
deal
i
could
talk
about
concerning
the
language
of
the
courts
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
take
your
honors'
time
unless
there's
a
question.
