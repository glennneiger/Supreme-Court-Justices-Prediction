mr.
buscemi,
do
we
know
whether
the
accident
reports
are
accurate
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they're
inaccurate,
would
they
be
misleading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
--
would
the
requesters
have
the
legal
right
to
republish
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
there
not
a
danger
that
that
would
be
misleading
if
they're
inaccurate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
question
i
just
thought
to
happen
at
the
same
time,
this
case
had
been
going
on
for
about
five
years,
isn't
it?
why
hasn't
the
commission
up
to
now
made
the
kind
of
investigation
that
would
--
that
would
lead
to
a
proper
disclosure
of
this
material?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
knowing
whether
their
accurate
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
inaccuracy
and
therefore
of
deception,
is
there
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
makes
much
difference
to
the
consumer
who
reads
--
reads
some
publication
that
there
are
4000
accidents
of
certain
description?
whether
or
not
the
commission
says,
â€œwe've
--
we
agree
or
we
disagree
if
they
just
say
this
material
came
out
of
the
commission's
files?
isn't
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
there
a
danger
of
deception
there?
