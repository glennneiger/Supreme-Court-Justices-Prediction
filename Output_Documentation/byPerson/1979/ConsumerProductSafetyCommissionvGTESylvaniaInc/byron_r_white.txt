justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask
i
we
--
if
we
agreed
with
you,
do
we
just
reverse
or
is
there
anything
open
on
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
foia
question
is
open
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
okay
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
hasn't
been
decided
that
the
--
that
the
standing
alone,
the
foia
exempts
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
question
is,
is
whether
some
other
statute
exempts
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
it's
--
so
you
think
you
must
argue
the
foia
to
--
into
an
--
in
order
to
interpret
6
(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
your
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
seemed
to
be
arguing
because
of
the
policy
of
the
foia
and
--
and
what
it's
trying
to
do
with
it
--
that
--
that
there
is
on
how
you
should
--
should
construe
(6)
(b).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
6
(b)
trying
to
do?
you
say
one
thing
it's
trying
to
do,
i
suppose,
is
to
keep
the
commission
from
itself
publishing
or
putting
its
stamp
of
approval
on
inaccurate
information.
but
part
of
that
purpose
is
to
--
it
is
to
keep
inaccurate
information
from
being
distributed,
isn't
it,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
yes,
but
you
would
think
the
congress
would
intend
the
commission,
although
it
--
if
it
--
if
it
wanted
to
put
its
informator
on
it
that
it
would
have
to
have
a
hearing.
but
if
it
just
wanted
to
respond
to
a
request
from
an
outsider,
it
could
distribute
all
the
most
inaccurate
information
without
any
safeguards
at
all.
do
you
think
congress
intended
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
use
subpoena
power
to
gather
inaccurate
information
and
then
turn
it
over
to
anybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
you're
arguing
the
foia?
let's
talk
about
6
(b).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
want
to
talk
6
(b)
why
don't
we
just
stick
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
--
and
i'd
--
again
i
ask
you,
what
was
6
(b)
trying
to
do?
keep
back
inaccurate
informations
from
being
distributed
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
but
never
mind
any
other
--
any
other
kind
of
distribution
under
the
foia.
however,
inaccurate
it
might
be,
collect
it
and
distribute
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
say
this
is
that
--
that
this
isn't
a
public
disclosure
that's
at
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
have
6
(b)
(1)
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
you
stumbled
over
walking
across
the
room.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
--
in
republishing,
what
might
be
released
under
foia?
the
republisher
isn't
required
to
put
on
a
little
warning
that
this
maybe
misleading.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
referring
to
something
that
was
refer
--
that
was
represented
to
a
--
to
a
--
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
judge.
suggesting
that
--
that
this
administrative
interpretation
was
a
late
bloomer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
--
it
arose
only
after
this
dispute
started.
