we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
consumer
product
safety
commission
and
others
against
gte
sylvania.
mr.
buscemi,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
that's
the
only
precaution
that
the
congress
took?
the
--
the
retraction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
--
you
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
so
much
that
i
--
i
got
the
impression
you
were
suggesting
this
would
--
this
took
care
of
everything.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
really
think
when
it
gets
on
to
the
public
that
any
significant
fraction
of
the
public
would
know
whether
it
did
or
did
not
have
some
kind
of
approval
of
the
commission?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
when
that
cat
is
out
the
bag,
how
many
people
are
going
to
make
that
kind
of
analysis
of
where
it
came
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
government
agency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
congress
authorized
the
commission
to
withhold
release
under
certain
circumstances,
then
you're
really
arguing
that
in
another
act,
congress
went
in
the
other
direction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven't
mentioned
if
--
or
if
you
did
i
missed
it,
the
matter
of
the
definition
of
what
is
a
tv
accidents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
--
has
the
commission
got
a
regulation
defining
what
they
mean
by
a
tv
accident?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
i
think
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
segal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
partly
related,
mr.
segal,
to
the
--
the
lack
of
the
definition
of
what
is
a
tv
accident?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
buscemi,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
question
is,
what
kind
of
disclosures
and
under
what
limitations,
isn't
it,
under
--
under
the
consumers
safety
act
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
which
is
quite
different
from
foia
have
--
foia
has
no
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
concerns
in
that
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let
me
try
to
--
let
me
see
if
i
gather
it
clear.
in
the
pierce
case,
you
had
a
situation
where
the
woman
used
a
cleaning
fluid,
if
i
have
that
case
correctly,
and
that
caused
the
fire
and
burned
down
her
home
and
injured
her.
now,
that
which
clearly
be
reported
as
a
consumer
--
an
accident
of
some
kind.
now,
suppose
the
housewife
is
watching
television
in
the
morning
and
forgets
to
turn
off
her
oven
and
not
only
burns
the
cake
but
sets
the
house
afire,
would
that
be
conceivably
reported
as
a
tv
related
accident?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
how
did
they
report
the
fellow
who
got
the
hernia
because
he
lifted
his
heavy
television
set?
is
that
a
tv
related
accident?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
they
did
it
in
an
abundance
of
cautionary
case.
the
commission
has
declined
apparently
to
define
what
they
mean
by
an
accident.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
standefer
against
the
united
--
