mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
relationship
between
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
section
6
(b)
(1)
of
the
consumer
product
safety
act.
the
case
is
here
because
two
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
disagreed
over
the
way
in
which
the
two
statutes
should
be
applied.
the
second
circuit
in
pierce
&
stevens
chemical
corporation
against
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
adopted
the
commissions
view
that
section
6
(b)
(1)
does
not
apply
when
the
commission
responds
to
an
foia
request.
four
months
later
in
the
present
case,
the
third
circuit
reached
the
contrary
result.
the
commission
petitioned
for
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
and
the
facts
here
are
straight
forward.
in
march
of
1974,
the
commission
published
a
notice
in
the
federal
register
announcing
the
time
and
place
of
a
public
hearing
to
discuss
television
receivers'
safety
with
emphasis
on
shock
and
fire
hazards.
the
notice
asked
manufacturers
to
submit
a
variety
of
information
concerning
television
safety
including
all
tv
related
accident
reports
collected
since
1969.
when
the
manufacturers'
response
to
this
informal
request
proved
unsatisfactory,
the
commission
sought
to
obtain
the
same
materials
through
the
special
order
and
subpoena
procedures
provided
in
section
27
(b)
of
the
consumer
product
safety
act.
eventually,
television
manufacturers
submitted
a
large
volume
of
information
to
the
commission,
the
vast
majority
of
which
consisted
of
tv
accident
data.
the
commission
received
more
than
7600
tv
related
accident
reports
concerning
accidents
occurring
between
1969
and
1974.
and
soon
after
the
manufacturers
began
to
submit
their
requested
materials,
consumers
union
of
the
united
states
and
public
citizen's
health
research
group
filed
foia
request
to
inspect
and
copy
the
information
submitted
including
the
tv
accident
reports.
in
response
to
those
requests,
the
commission
made
available
all
of
the
materials
submitted
by
the
manufacturers
as
to
which
no
claim
of
confidentiality
had
been
made.
the
commission
then
notified
the
manufacturers
of
the
outstanding
foia
requests
and
asked
them
to
substantiate
the
earlier
claims
of
confidentiality
that
they
had
made
at
the
time
they
submitted
the
information.
the
manufacturers
responded
by
asserting
that
the
accident
reports
and
some
other
materials
were
exempt
from
mandatory
disclosure
under
the
foia,
under
exemption
4,
the
so-called
“trade
secret
exemption”
and
exemption
7,
the
exemption
for
investigatory
files
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
they
also
asserted
that
some
of
the
material
including
some
of
the
material
within
the
accident
reports
could
not
be
released
because
to
release
it
would
be
to
violate
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
trade
secrets
act,
18
u.s.c.
1905.
the
commission
then
reviewed
the
accident
reports
and
the
manufacturers'
submissions
on
confidentiality
and
determined
that
the
bulk
of
the
material
was
not
exempt
from
mandatory
disclosure
under
the
foia.
the
commission
notified
the
manufacturers
of
its
determination
and
told
them
they
would
withhold
three
categories
of
information,
accident
data
that
identified
the
name
and
address
of
an
accident
victim
or
included
other
personal
information,
the
release
of
which
might
result
in
an
invasion
of
privacy,
accident
data
in
the
form
of
legal
material
such
as
legal
memoranda
and
correspondents
with
an
attorney
privilege
because
of
the
attorney-client
relationship
or
the
attorney
work
product
doctrine.
and
finally,
technical
data
that
the
submitting
company
had
kept
secret
and
the
release
of
which
might
have
caused
substantial
harm
to
the
company.
the
commission
also
informed
the
manufacturers
that
because
of
the
apparent
variations
in
the
way
the
manufacturers
had
maintained
their
accident
records
over
the
years
between
1969
and
1974
that
the
release
of
those
records
under
the
foia
would
be
accompanied
by
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
because
of
the
variations,
some
of
the
data
could
be
misleading.
now,
there's
never
been
any
dispute
in
this
litigation
about
anything
but
the
accident
reports,
because
in
may
1975,
the
requesters
agreed
to
limit
their
request
to
those
reports,
edited
to
eliminate
the
personal
information
about
the
accident
victims
and
the
legal
materials.
after
the
commission
announced
this
decision,
respondents,
who
are
12
of
the
affected
to
television
manufacturers,
filed
separate
lawsuits
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
delaware,
and
three
other
district
courts.
all
12
suits
were
eventually
consolidated
in
the
district
of
delaware.
in
addition
to
their
--
repeating
their
contentions
regarding
the
foia
exemptions
in
the
trade
secrets
act,
respondents,
for
the
first
time,
alleged
that
the
commission's
proposed
release
of
the
accident
reports
would
violate
section
6
(b)
(1)
of
the
consumer
product
safety
act.
the
district
court
accepted
this
argument
and
permanently
enjoined
the
commission
from
releasing
the
materials
without
complying
with
the
procedural
requirements
of
section
6
(b)
(1).
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed,
rejecting
the
analysis
of
the
second
circuit
in
pierce
&
stevens
chemical
corporation.
now,
because
both
courts
have
--
have
decided
this
case
in
reliance
of
section
6
(b)
(1),
neither
has
ever
addressed
the
allegations
by
respondents
that
the
accident
reports
are
exempt
from
mandatory
disclosure
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
so
the
case
comes
to
the
court
in
a
posture
that
disclosure
is
required
under
the
foai,
unless
respondents
are
correct
about
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
6
(b)
(1).
now,
section
6
(b)
(1)
applies
to
public
disclosures
of
information
by
the
commission.
the
statute
provides
that
when
the
commission
proposes
to
make
a
public
disclosure
of
information.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
we
think
that
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
now,
the
statute
provides
that
when
the
commission
proposes
to
release
information
from
which
the
public
could
readily
ascertain
the
identity
of
a
particular
consumer
product
and
the
manufacturer
or
a
labeler
of
that
product,
the
commission
must
follow
four
procedural
rules.
the
first
one,
is
that
the
commission
must
notify
the
affected
manufacture,
must
provide
him
with
the
summary
of
the
information
to
be
disclosed,
and
it
must
afford
him
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
comment
on
that
information.
the
second
requirement
is
that
the
commission
must
take
reasonable
steps
to
assure
the
accuracy
of
the
information.
the
third
requirement
is
that
the
commission
must
take
reasonable
steps
to
ensure
that
disclosure
would
be
fair
under
the
circumstances
and
reasonably
related
to
effectuating
the
purposes
of
the
act.
and
the
fourth
requirement
is
that
if
the
commission
discovers
after
a
disclosure
had
been
made,
that
some
of
the
information
disclosed
is
inaccurate
or
misleading,
it
must
publish
a
retraction
“in
a
manner
similar
to
that
in
which
the
original
disclosure
was
made.
mr.
peter
buscemi
language
of
6
(b)
(1)
itself,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
now,
the
commission's
position
is
that
these
four
requirements
of
section
6
(b)
(1)
did
not
apply
when
the
commission
responds
to
and
foia
request.
stated
it
in
a
different
way,
the
commission
believes
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
phrase
“public
disclosures
of
information”
under
section
6
(b)
(1)
to
include
releases
of
information
in
response
to
the
mandatory
disclosure
provisions
of
the
foia.
the
commission
arrived
that
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
it
administers
for
three
principle
reasons
that
i'd
like
to
discuss
in
turn.
the
first
one
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
and
the
commission
was
confronted
with
the
situation
in
which
it
had
to
decide
--
it
receives
many
foia
request
and
it
therefore
had
to
decide
whether
or
not,
and
if
so
how
section
6
(b)
(1)
applied
in
that
context,
so
it
was
necessarily
required
to
make
this
kind
of
interpretation.
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
i
think
the
critical
consider
--
consideration
here
is
congressional
intent,
although
the
commission
is
certainly
authorized
to
promulgate
regulations
to
explain
how
it's
going
to
interpret
and
apply
the
statute.
now,
the
--
the
first
of
the
principal
reasons
or
the
set
of
reasons
that
i
want
to
discuss
are
the
contrasting
structure
and
purpose
of
the
consumer
product
safety
act
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
freedom
of
information
act
on
the
other.
now,
when
congress
we
used
the
phrase
“public
disclosure
of
information”
in
section
6
of
the
consumer
product
safety
act,
it
was
referring
to
the
sorts
of
affirmative
disclosures
made
at
the
commission's
initiative
and
with
the
commission's
endorsement
that
are
mandated
elsewhere
in
the
act.
the
act
taken
as
a
whole
makes
clear,
and
respondents
have
never
disputed
that
the
primary
function
assigned
to
the
commission
by
statute
is
the
collection,
analysis,
and
dissemination
of
consumer
product
safety
information.
we've
listed
in
our
brief
at
pages
15
to
17,
a
number
of
the
act's
provisions
that
direct
the
commission
to
make
public
disclosures
or
to
require
such
disclosures
by
others.
the
most
important
example
of
those
provision
is
section
5
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
which
directs
the
commission
to
maintain
an
injury
information
clearing
house,
to
collect,
investigate,
analyze,
and
distribute
injury
data
and
information
relating
to
the
causes
of
death,
injury,
and
illness
associated
with
consumer
products.
the
commission
is,
thus
under
a
statutory
obligation
to
investigate
possible
safety
hazards
and
to
disclose
the
results
of
its
investigations
even
if
no
one
ever
asks
for
those
results.
and
section
6
of
the
act
follows
immediately
after
section
5,
and
the
commission
believes
that
even
the
placement
of
the
two
sections
in
the
statute
supports
its
view
that
the
public
disclosures
of
information
to
which
section
6
refers
are
those
undertaken
by
the
commission
in
the
performance
of
it's
statutory
duties.
this
interpretation
makes
sense,
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
consumer
product
safety
act,
which
is
to
educate
the
public
with
respect
to
product
safety
hazards.
when
the
commission
makes
a
public
disclosure
of
the
kind
described
in
the
act,
it
wants
and
expects
the
consuming
public
to
trust
the
accuracy
of
the
information
disclosed
and
to
rely
on
it
in
making
purchasing
decisions
with
respect
to
consumer
products.
the
protections
required
by
6
(b)
(1)
fit
perfectly
in
this
context.
indeed,
the
statute
was
designed,
specifically,
to
protect
against
the
harm
that
a
manufacturer
might
suffer,
if
the
commission,
through
its
weight
behind
a
public
disclosure
of
information
that
reflected
adversely
on
a
particular
product
and
that
subsequently
proved
to
be
erroneous.
that
was
the
danger
that
congressman
crane
stressed
on
the
house
floor
in
his
discussion
of
the
ftc's
treatment
of
zerex
antifreeze
that
we
reprint
in
the
brief
at
pages
34
to
35.
and
it
was
the
danger
against
the
rep
--
against
which
the
representative
of
respondent,
general
electric
company,
warned
when
he
testified
at
the
house
subcommittee
hearing
on
the
consumer
product
safety
legislation
that
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
retraction
is
only
one
of
the
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--
four
requirements
in
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--
section
6
(b)
(1).
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
do
that.
i
meant
to
say
that
the
four
requirements
of
section
6
(b)
(1)
have
particular
application
and
the
commission
argues
exclusive
application
when
the
commission
is
making
an
affirmative
public
disclosure
of
information.
that
is
the
time
at
which
there
is
some
danger
that
a
manufacturer
will
be
injured
if
the
commission
discloses
inaccurate
or
misleading
information.
and
that
is
why
section
6
(b)
(1)
was
included,
all
four
requirements
in
section
6
(b)
(1).
by
contrast,
when
the
commission
releases
information
under
the
compulsion
of
an
foia
request,
the
commission
does
not
vouch
for
its
accuracy.
there's
no
distribution
to
the
public
at
large,
much
less
is
there
any
expectation
or
intention
that
the
public
will
learn
of
the
information
or
rely
on
it.
and
indeed,
to
forestall
any
such
reliance,
the
commission
frequently
accompanies
foia
releases
with
the
kind
of
disclaimer
proposed
in
this
case,
telling
the
requester
that
the
information
he
or
she
has
requested
may
for
one
reason
or
other
be
misleading.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that
maybe
so,
but
it
does
not
in
any
way
detract
from
the
distinction
between
the
foia
release
and
the
release
at
the
commission's
initiative
that
i'm
trying
to
--
to
make
here.
i
mean,
there
may
be
distinctions
between
the
kinds
of
information
that
the
commission
possesses,
but
those
distinctions
are
different
in
the
distinction
between
an
foia
release
and
the
release
at
the
commission's
initiative
and
with
the
commission's
approval,
such
as
the
kind
that
the
commission
is
directed
to
make
under
the
statute.
now,
the
foia
applies
to
all
government
agencies.
it's
not
concerned
with
instructing
the
public
about
the
dangers
of
consumer
products.
it's
concerned
with
opening
the
processes
of
government
to
public
scrutiny.
and
the
accuracy
of
the
information
in
the
government's
possession
is
irrelevant
to
that
purpose.
the
commission's
only
duty
under
the
foia,
the
duty
that
it
shares
with
every
other
government
agency,
is
to
release
those
documents
reasonably
described
in
an
foia
request
that
happened
to
be
within
its
possession
and
control.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
exemptions
under
the
foia
merely
give
the
commission
discretion
to
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
release
them
under
the
foia.
as
far
as
--
when
this
--
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
no
--
neither
court
below
has
ruled
on
the
question
of
whether
any
of
this
material
is
exempt
from
mandatory
disclosure.
the
commission
has
determined
that
it's
not
exempt
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
premise
from
which
we
have
to
begin
here.
the
only
question
presented
here,
and
the
only
question
decided
below,
is
whether
section
6
(b)
(1)
applies
in
the
foia
context.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
it
hasn't
been
decided
that
any
of
the
foia
exemptions
are
applicable.
mr.
peter
buscemi
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
commission
has
but
i
mean
by
either
of
the
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--
courts
below.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
question
is
whether
the
procedures
mandated
by
section
6
(b)
(1)
must
be
followed
in
this
context.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
commission
has
received
foia
requests.
the
question
is,
how
does
the
commission
respond,
must
it
follow
6
(b)
(1)
in
doing
so.
so
that
means
their
case
only
arises
because
of
the
foia
request.
that
--
that's
the
context
in
which
we
discuss
the
foia.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
reason
for
discussing
the
foia
is
merely
to
point
out
that
the
statute
is
completely
different
from
the
consumer
products
safety
act.
and
whereas
the
procedural
protections
under
the
act
make
sense
in
the
context
of
the
act,
they
don't
make
sense
in
the
context
of
the
foia
which
is
designed
to
serve
completely
different
purpose.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
purpose
is
to
keep
inaccurate
information
from
being
distributed
by
the
commission
at
its
initiative
and
with
its
approval.
the
foia
applies
to
all
government
agencies
and
all
--
and
there
are
many
other
government
agencies
that
have
very
significant
information
gathering
power
very
similar,
if
not,
broader
than
the
commission.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
it's
not
a
question
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
it's
not
a
question
of
what
the
commission
wants
to
do,
the
foia
request
must
come
in
and
the
commission
is
compelled
under
the
foia
to
release
the
information.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
6
(b)
doesn't
give
the
subpoena
power,
that's
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
but
the
point
is
that
in
the
commission's
view,
section
6
(b)
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
it
was
trying
to
keep
inaccurate
information
from
being
distributed
by
the
commission
at
its
own
initiative
and
with
its
approval,
with
the
intention
that
the
public
--
and
--
should
rely
on
it.
when
the
commission
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
sir,
section
6
(b)
does
not
direct
the
commission
to
collect
information
and
distribute
it
under
the
foia.
section
6
(b)
applies
only
to
public
disclosures
of
information
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
other
provisions
in
the
act
direct
the
commission
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
we
say
that
a
response
to
an
foia
request
is
not
a
public
disclosure
of
information
within
the
meaning
of
section
6
(b)
(1).
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
and
the
very
same
kind
of
subpoena
power,
indeed,
perhaps
even
greater
subpoena
power
is
vested
in
many
other
government
agencies,
none
of
whom
are
required
to
comply
with
their
provision
like
section
6
(b)
(1).
and
that's
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
absolutely
right.
and
that's
because
there's
a
major
distinction
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
there's
a
major
distinction
between
letting
it
out
under
the
consumer
products
safety
act
with
the
commission's
imprimatur
on
it
telling
the
public,
“rely
on
this,
don't
use
that
kind
of
microphone.”
then
there
is
in
releasing
it
to
an
foia
requester
under
the
compulsion
of
the
foia
and
just
saying,
“this
is
what
we
have.
we
--
we
don't
make
any
statements
with
respect
to
its
accuracy
at
all.”
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
there
is
no
vouching
for
it
by
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
in
any
representation
that
there
was.
it's
simply
something
outside
of
the
commission's
control,
the
commission
has
never
approved
it
or
said
that
it
was
correct.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--
if
you
simply
look
at
the
information
that's
at
issue
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
accident
reports,
many
of
which
were
submitted
to
the
television
manufacturers
by
individual
consumers,
hand
written
letters,
very
brief
type
letters,
my
television
exploded,
my
television
caught
on
fire.
this
is
not
the
sort
of
material
that
is
likely
to
engender
public
trust
just
because
it's
released
by
the
commission.
the
point
is
that
the
commission
in
responding
to
the
foia
request
from
this
material
says
absolutely
nothing
about
whether
these
reports
of
accidents
from
individual
consumers
are
accurate
or
not.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
foia
exceptions
have
some
application
in
this
context,
but
they
have
not
yet
been
adjudicated
in
any
way.
there
may
be
--
the
--
the
respondents
have
made
arguments
with
respect
to
abusive
discretion
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
they've
also
made
arguments
under
the
trade
secrets
act.
those
are
the
appropriate
arguments
we
submit
to
be
considered
in
this
case.
those
are
the
arguments
that
would
have
to
be
made
with
respect
to
any
government
agency.
those
are
the
kind
of
arguments
that
were
considered
by
this
court
in
chrysler
against
brown.
mr.
peter
buscemi
those
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
commission
has
found
that
this
material
is
not
exempt
from
mandatory
disclosure
under
the
foia.
but
that
finding
is
not
at
issue
here,
it
may
be
right,
it
may
be
wrong.
the
commission
believes
it's
correct,
but
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
ought
to
be
made
under
the
foia.
it's
--
it's
precisely
the
kind
of
inquiry
the
congress
has
regarded
as
sufficient
to
protect
submitters
of
information
to
all
other
government
agencies.
and
i
think
the
chrysler
against
brown
demonstrates
that
it
is
the
kind
of
requirement
that
can
protect
submitters.
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
misleading.
i
think
that
we
know
that
the
respondents
received
these
accident
reports
from
individual
consumers,
that
is
they
are
accurate
and
not
misleading
to
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
there
is
a
danger
that
it
would
be
misleading
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
because,
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
are
over
7600
accident
reports
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
and
--
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
that
i'd
like
to
address
just
briefly,
there're
enormous
practical
problems
involved
here
if
it
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
in
going
out
and
finding
each
individual
consumer
who
submitted
a
report,
checking
his
television
or
her
television,
making
certain
that
the
reports
happened
and
so
on.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
there
is
a
disclosure,
first
of
all,
not
to
the
public
at
large
and
not
with
the
commission's
approval,
and
there
is
no
risk
that
anyone
will
think
that
that
commission
puts
its
imprimatur
on
these
reports,
because
the
commission
has
not
done
so.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think
that
may
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
buscemi
precisely.
it's
true
of
material
collected
by
the
ftc
and
the
fcc
pursuant
to
those
agencies'
investigative
powers
and
that
--
that
is
the
--
the
critical
point
here.
congress
has
provided
adequate
protections
with
respect
to
that
material,
protections
that
apply
to
all
the
government
agencies.
6
(b)
(1)
is
addressed
to
a
different
matter
and
it
involves
only
public
disclosures
of
information
under
the
act,
in
the
performance
of
the
commissions
duties
under
the
act.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
commission
does
not
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
precisely
why
the
commission
proposed
to
attach
a
disclaimer
to
the
release
of
information
stating
that
there
were
different
recording
and
collecting
procedures
followed
by
the
different
manufacturers.
and
therefore,
the
reports
submitted
by
the
different
manufacturers
might
differ
and
be
misleading
in
that
way.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
at
this
time.
mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
only
two
brief
points.
this
case
is
purely
a
case
of
congressional
intent.
respondents
have
not
replied
to
either
of
two
points
that
the
commission
relies
on
in
both
of
its
briefs.
the
first
is,
respondent
has
not
explained
why
congress
would
have
decided
to
place
a
provision
like
section
6
(b)
(1)
in
the
consumer
product
safety
act
but
not
in
any
other
statute
that
in
--
that
creates
an
agency
and
empowers
an
agency
to
require
private
parties
to
produce
information
submitted
to
the
agency.
all
government
agencies
are
subject
to
the
foia
and
that
includes
government
agencies
created
by
statutes
even
after
1972
when
there
has
this
--
been
this
atmosphere
of
avoiding
overregulation,
commodities
futures
trading
commission
is
just
one
example.
and
there's
no
indication
anywhere
in
respondents'
argument
or
in
brief,
what
the
explanation
would
be
for
applying
6
(b)
(1)
to
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
alone.
moreover,
there's
--
there's
a
second
point
where
there's
no
explanation.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
true
but
the
question
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
but
the
point
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--
point
is
that
there
is
something
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
there
is
something
special
about
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
and
that
is
that
it
has
this
obligation
to
make
disclosures
to
the
public.
that's
why
section
6
(b)
(1)
has
to
be
there
because
that's
why
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
is
different.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
and
we
will
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
and
that's
why
we
said
that
6
(b)
(1)
does
not
apply
under
the
foia.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
don't
see
how,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
was
--
that
was
submitted
to
the
commission
by
one
of
the
manufacturers.
why
they
submitted
it?
i
don't
know.
i
mean
the
commission
is
not
responsible.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
commission
did
state
to
the
manufacturers
that
it
wanted
them
to
submit
the
broadest
possible
spectrum
of
materials
so
that
they'd
be
the
largest
possible
database
to
determine
whether
there
should
be
a
proceeding
initiated
to
promulgate
a
safety
rule
related
to
television
sets.
commission
did
not
say
to
report
every
accident
that
occurred
anytime
a
television
was
on
within
100
feet
or
something.
i
mean,
it
just
was
not
done.
i
just
want
to
briefly
mention
the
second
point
that
i
had
and
that
is,
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
1976
amendment
to
the
act
in
section
29
(e).
this
is
discussed
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
have
time
to
go
into
it
but
the
--
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
conference
committee
report
to
that
section
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
congress
believes
that
there
is
no
obligation
to
comply
with
the
procedures
in
section
6
(b)
(1)
when
the
commission
or
another
federal
agency
responds
to
an
foia
request.
thank
you.
