previously,
another
cab
driver
had
been
shot
and
killed?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
he
was
placed
in
a
caged
police
car
with
three
police
officers?
justice
potter
stewart
and
one
in
the
caged
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
the
basic
issue
here,
in
the
case
before
us,
whether
or
not
there
was
interrogation
of
innis?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
really
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
there
was
no
interrogation,
you
win,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
brewer,
that
was
not
an
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
and
every
court
that
examined
the
brewer
case
described
that
so-called
christian
burial
speech
as
interrogation.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
only
in
this
court,
but
every
court
along
the
way;
that
had
not
been
an
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it
can.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
get
to
any
question
of
waiver
if
there
was
no
interrogation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
overturn
miranda,
of
course,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
overruling
approach
to
miranda?
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
not
involve
an
issue
of
interrogation.
justice
potter
stewart
everybody
had
agreed--
justice
potter
stewart
--in
the
brewer
case
that
that
was
interrogation.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
talking
about
every
court.
every
court.
justice
potter
stewart
every
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
most
importantly,
it
was
not
directed
to
innis.
justice
potter
stewart
by
contrast
with
the
christian
burial
speech.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
seminole
massiah
case,
there
was
a
conversation
in
the
front
seat
of
a
car
between
massiah
and
his
friend
who
was
wired
for
sound.
as
i
remember,
that
was
not
interrogation,
as
one
might
ordinarily
characterize
interrogation.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yes,
i
know
that;
massiah's
friend
was
an
agent
of
the
police.
justice
potter
stewart
and
massiah
doctrine
has
nothing
to
do
whatsoever
with
coercive
circumstances.
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
i
remember
the
facts
in
massiah,
it
was
not
a
q
and
a
sort
of
interrogation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
massiah
rule
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
pressure.
justice
potter
stewart
just
nothing.
or
custody,
or
coercive
circumstances,
or
anything
such
as--similar
to
anything
such
as
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but,
to
follow
up
on
what
my
brother
rehnquist
has
asked
you,
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
as
far
as
the
court
is
concerned,
the
issue
in
brewer
v.
williams
is
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
waiver?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
conceded,
at
least
in
the
courts--now
some
members
of
this
court
disagree--but
in
the
courts,
every
court
that
had
considered
brewer
v.
williams
had
conceded
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
and
the
question
is
-
had
there
been
a
waiver
of
that
violation?
in
this
case,
the
preliminary,
primary,
first
question
is
-
was
there
a
violation
at
all?
and
those
are
two
quite
different
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
would
agree
with
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
every
court,
in
brewer
v.
williams,
had
held
that
brewer's
massiah
rights
had
been
violated.
the
question
is
-
had
he
waived
them?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
it
were
unknowing,
such
as
in
the
original
massiah
case?
then
would
any
of
the
rationale
of
miranda
be
applicable
about
coercive
statements--coercive
circumstances?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
were
totally
unknown
to
the
interrogee
that
he
was
being
interrogated.
justice
potter
stewart
the
further
distress
under
which
he
is
under--suffering.
but
if
he
doesn't
even
know
he
is
being
interrogated,
how
is
that
stress
relevant?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
that
none
of
the
police
officers
purportedly,
purported
to
direct
their
remarks
to
innis,
any
of
their
remarks
at
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
innis
no
more
than
overheard?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
just
was--limited
to
that
question,
you
agree
that
the
record
shows
that--
justice
potter
stewart
--innis
no
more
than
overheard
a
conversation
between
the
officers?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
thought
was
erroneously
admitted
into
evidence
here
was
the
shotgun
itself,
plus
testimony
as
to
the
circumstances
of
its
discovery;
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
which
were
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
discovered.
that's
what
i
intended
by
that.
he
didn't
make
any
admissions
with
respect
to
his
guilt
of
the
underlying
offense
with
which
he
was
charged,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
the
introduction
of
the
shotgun,
and
the
fact
that
he
had
led
the
officers
to
discover
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
issue
of
inevitable
discovery
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
discuss
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how,
in
fact,
was
it
concealed,
and
where?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's--miranda
held
that
it
was,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
then
any
interrogation
of
a
person
in
custody.
