chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
rhode
island
against
innis.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
referred
to
the
doctrinal
and
factual
distinctions,
or
lack
of
it,
by
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
if
you
take
innis
out
of
the
back
seat
of
that
car
and
put
brewer
in
it
and
have
the
christian
burial
speech
made
by
the
two
men
in
the
front
seat,
you'd
have
this
case
all
over
again,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
fellow
had
never
been
charged.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
under
arrest
and
in
custody,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
we
talk--miranda
deals
with
custodial
interrogation,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
just
philosophizing;
is
that
your
suggestion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
he
was
counting
on
the
fact
that
you
can't
do
ballistic
tests
on
a
sawed-off
shotgun
the
way
you
can
on
a
.38
caliber
pistol;
is
that
possible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean,
you've
referred
to
the
christian
burial
speech
of
brewer
several
times,
and
we
have,
too.
in
brewer,
wasn't
it
also
a
fact
that
beside--in
addition
to
referring
to
a
christian
burial,
there
was
reference
to
the
fact
that
if
the
child,
who
had
been
kidnapped,
was
still
alive,
it
might
not
survive
in
that--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--climate?
now,
wasn't
the
duty
of
the
officer--all
the
officers
in
the
brewer
car--the
same
with
respect
to
trying
to
retrieve
and
recover
that
living
child,
if
it
was
living,
as
the
officers
in
this
innis
automobile
to
recover
that
gun?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
i
take
it
you're--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
since
we're
psychoanalyzing
[illegible
word]
petitioners,
would
your
position
be
that
what
took
place
in
the
car,
whatever
it
was,
was
the
same
as
though,
over
the
car
radio
from
headquarters,
came
a
message
from
the
captain
or
inspector
saying,
"when
you
deliver
innis,
when
you're
through
with
him,
get
some
men
out
into
that
area
and
try
to
find
that
shotgun
so
that
some
of
the
children
from
the
handicapped--handicapped
children
from
the
local
school
won't
hurt
themselves?"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
macfadyen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
from
what
you
say,
i
take
it
that
if
the
arrested
person,
person
in
custody,
was
taken
in,
and
sat
down,
and
the
desk
sergeant
said,
"the
first
thing
i
want
to
know
is,
give
me
your
name
and
address,"
and
the
answer
was,
"never
mind
my
name
and
address,
i
want
to
confess;
i
killed
so-and-so."
that
would
be
interrogation,
an
impermissible
absent
a
waiver
under
miranda
and
following
a
miranda
warning,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you
had
said
something
to
the
effect
that
as
soon
as
they
asked
the
question,
or
words
to
that
effect,
the
interrogation
began?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
procedural
as
distinguished
from
substantive
questioning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
massiah
was--what
was
the
activity
of
the
police
or
others
that
interfered
with
consultation
with
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
a
very
good
friend.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
in
response
to
my
hypothetical
question
to
the
attorney
general,
that
if
the
same
words
that
were
spoken
here
in
the
front
seat
of
the
car
had
come
over
the
car
radio
from
headquarters
of
the
police,
no
one
in
the
car
had
uttered
them,
and
then
the--all
of
the
events
following
that
would
be
the
same,
what
would
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
the
words
are
precisely
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
my
hypothesis
was
that
over
the
car
radio,
exactly
the
same
words
which
were
uttered
in
the
car
on
this
record
came
over
as
a
direction
to
the
police
in
the
car
to
find
that
gun
to
prevent
injury
to
children.
then
what
would
you
say?
would
you
call
that
interrogation
or
suggestive
psychological
pressure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
assume
he
was
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
your
warning
sign,
counsel.
in
case
you
have
more,
you
have
five
minutes
more.
four
minutes,
to
be
precise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
have
about
three
minutes
if
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
