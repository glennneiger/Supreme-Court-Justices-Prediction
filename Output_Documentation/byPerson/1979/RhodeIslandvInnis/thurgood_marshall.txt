justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why'd
he
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
after--he
got
him
turned
around
though,
didn't
he?
at
the
request
of
the
man,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
point
is,
i
don't
know
just
how
innocent
that
conversation
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
i
have
a
great
difficulty
with
deciding
how
much
major
intelligence
the
two-year-on-the-force
cop--policeman--has,
and
a
ten-year.
i
have
a
lot
of
difficulty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
i
think
a
police
officer
who's
had
two
years
training
with
the
fbi
might
be
equal
to
a
police
in
a
country
place
that
had
never
seen
a
city.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don't
see
the
purpose
of
the--these
very
innocent
people
sitting
up
there
in
the
front
seat.
they
were
qualified
police
officers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
qualified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
try
to
make
them
unqualified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
it's
the
same
as
then
discussing
what
happened
in
the
world
series
last
night?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
totally
absent.
they
were
looking
for
a
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
were
discussing
a
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
were
discussing
this
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
