justice
byron
r.
white
and
yours?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did--what
violation
was
found
in
brewer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
and
miranda
is
a
fifth
amendment
case,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
should
be
able
to
say
at
the
outset
that
brewer
is
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
massiah
approach
isn't
applicable
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
been
no
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
still,
even
if
brewer
is
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
miranda
isn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
neither
is--hence,
neither
is
the
question
of
interrogation
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
have
that
clear,
because
i
think
it
bears
on
this
case
in
a
way.
incidentally,
you
referred
to
the
american
criminal
law
issue.
it's
of
interest
to
me
that
in
that
same
issue,
there's
another
article
taking
the
opposite
side
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
difference
if
this
officer
wanted
to
find
the
gun--
justice
byron
r.
white
probably
interested
in
where
the
gun
was,
wasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
that
doesn't
affect
the
interrogation
issue,
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
rehnquist.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i'm
still
interested
in
your
answer,
not
your
interpretation
of
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island.
what
is
your
position
on
whether
the
interrogation
issue
is
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
rule
of
law
would
be
that
unless
the
remark
is
directed
at
the
defendant,
it's
not
interrogation.
would
that
be
the
rule
you
ask
us
to
adopt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
obviously,
brewer
establishes
you
don't
need
a
question
mark.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
that
if--that
even
if
it
was
intended
to
bring
forth
the
response,
if
it
was
not
directed
at
the
defendant
it
would
not
be
interrogation?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the--what
if
the
trier
of
fact
were
persuaded
that
the
reasonable
probability
of
the
conversation
were
to
bring
out
a
response
from
the
defendant?
would
it
be
interrogation,
regardless
of
what
the
subjective
motivation
of
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
have
to
direct
it
in
terms
in
which
i'm
speaking
to
you?
it
just
has
to
be
directed
in
the
sense
of
intended,
or
likely,
to
bring
out
a
statement--
justice
byron
r.
white
--by
the--because
that
happened
here,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
bring
a--well--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
trial
judge
describes
what
the
defendant
does
as
his
response
to
the
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
thought
there
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
have
any
finding
here
on
what
the
intent
of
the
officer
was,
do
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
there
was--or
you
could
argue,
at
least--that
even
if
there
was
sufficient
interrogation
in
brewer
to
make
out
an
invasion
of
the
right
to
counsel,
it
might
not
have,
in
brewer,
been
an
interrogation
for
the
purposes
of
miranda--a
miranda
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
interrogation
may
not
be
interrogation
in
every
possible
context.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but--
well,
he
may
have
admitted
that
a--if
it
had
been
a
miranda
issue,
he
may
have
been--admitted
a
violation
there.
which
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
miranda
was
violated
here,
even
if
there
would
have
been
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
