justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you've
said
that,
in
response
to
questions
from
my
colleagues,
that
the
brewer
case
was
written,
as
i
understand
it
was,
to--on
a
sixth
amendment
basis,
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
fifth
amendment
question.
and
yet
is
there
an
element
of
interrogation
in
each?
or
is
interrogation
only
in
the--only
in
this
particular
case?
did
brewer
not
involve
any
question
of
interrogation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if--although
not
contested--there
was
an--interrogation
was
one
of
the
elements
in
the
holding
of
brewer,
and
you
say
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
interrogation
here
is
important
in
the
fifth
amendment
context;
then
is
the
question
of
interrogation
in
the
abstract
involved
both
in
the
fifth
amendment
miranda-type
situation
and
in
the
sixth
amendment
massiah-type
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
was
not
on
a--when
you
say
it
was
not
on
a
long
ride,
how
long
a
trip
was
it
that
these
officers
were
instructed
to
make?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
half-mile?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
they
turned
around
and
went
back?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
macfadyen,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
just
as
miranda
was
propounded
by
the
court
because
it
was
so
difficult
to
actually
analyze
the
factual
circumstances
in
which
a
prisoner
claimed
a
confession
was
beaten
out
of
him
involuntarily,
the
court
felt
a
prophylactic
rule
was
necessary,
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island,
which
you
now
support,
feels
that
now
it's
so
difficult
to
decide
whether
miranda
warnings
have
been
respected
and
miranda
assertions
of--claims
of
miranda
rights
have
been
respected
by
the
police,
that
we
need
another
tier
of
prophylactic
rule
in
order
to
make
sure
that
miranda
isn't
violated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
that
wrong,
under
miranda?
under
brewer
it's
clearly
wrong
if
the
man
is
in
custody
and
has
been
arraigned,
but
is
that
wrong
under
miranda?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
seems
to
be
general
agreement
among
members
of
the
court
and
your
opponent
and
you
that
brewer
and
miranda
and--are
not
the
same
cases
at
all.
brewer
specifically
said
that
it
was
not
a
miranda
holding.
and
yet
the
supreme--we're
concerned
with
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
that
made
a
great
deal
of
the
similarities
between
this
case
and
brewer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which--and
brewer
was
not
a
miranda
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
factual
similarities
to
brewer
can
be
relied
on
you,
why
can't
factual
dissimilarities,
such
as
the
totally
different
exposure
of
time,
be
relied
on
by
your
opponent?
