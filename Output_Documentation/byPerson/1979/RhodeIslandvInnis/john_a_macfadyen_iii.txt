mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
questions
regarding
the
legal
effect
of
a
request
for
counsel
made
by
a
suspect
in
custody.
given
the
fact
of
this
request,
it
also
raises
questions
regarding
the
effect
of
what
the
respondent
would
term
an
emotionally
evocative
conversation
which
followed
immediately
upon
the
request.
finally,
it
raises
questions
regarding
the
admissibility
of
tangible
evidence
that
was
seized
as
a
result
of
admissions
evoked
from
innis
in
the
police
wagon.
respondent
contends
that
once
he
had
unambiguously
asked
for
an
attorney,
the
police
violated
the
miranda
mandate
when
they
exerted
further
pressure
on
him
to
incriminate
himself,
even
though
this
pressure
did
not
take
the
form
of
a
direct
statement
or
a
question.
as
this
pressure
resulted
in
an
incriminating
statement,
the
violation
could
not
be
cured
by
an
immediate
subsequent
rendition
of
the
miranda
warnings,
and
a
repetition
of
the
inculpatory
statement
made
previously.
finally,
the
respondent
would
argue
that
where
the
police
from
the
very
first
were
seeking
an
item
of
tangible
evidence,
and
they
succeeded
in
locating
it
only
by
frustrating
his
exercise
of
his
right
to
counsel,
the
tangible
evidence,
as
well
as
the
earlier
admissions,
should
be
suppressed
from
evidence.
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
rhode
island
has
outlined
the
facts
in
this
case.
i
would--i
would
simply
like
to
illuminate
several
of
those
facts
and
perhaps
mention
a
few
that
were
overlooked.
first
of
all,
it
would
appear
clear
from
the
record
that
thomas
innis
realized
that
the
police
officers
were
looking
for
the
shotgun.
at
the
time
he
received
his
second
set
of
warnings,
police
officers
were
already
searching
the
area
for
the
gun.
and
at
that
point,
innis
was
apparently
out
of
the
patrol
car
that
he
had
originally
been
placed
in.
secondly,
there's
some
indication
in
the
record
through
testimony
by
officer
gleckman
that
he
was
instructed
by
his
captain
not
to
interrogate
or
coerce
innis
in
any
way
en
route
to
the
police
station.
there's
no
indication
in
the
record
that
innis,
in
fact,
could
hear
what
might
be
termed
these
reassuring
instructions.
in
fact,
the
evidence
indicates
that
at
that
time
he
was
in
fact
inside
the
wagon
with
the
closed--with
the
doors
closed,
and
that
he
could
not
hear
those
instructions.
also,
the
state
has
raised
the
point
that
officer
gleckman
was
what
i
think
the
dissent
in
innis
termed
a
street
cop,
and
therefore,
putting
it
somewhat
bluntly,
that
he
wasn't
smart
enough
to
come
up
with
this
kind
of
a
ploy.
i
frankly
can't
presume
that
a
street
officer
doesn't
have
the
creativity,
even
in
the
brief
time
allotted
to
him,
to
produce
the
kind
of
statements
that
he
produced
here,
and
moreover
to
produce
them
with
an
intent
to
gain
information
regarding
an
item
of
tangible
evidence.
finally,
i
think
it
is
crucial
to
note
in
this
case,
and
perhaps
most
crucial,
that
the
record
here
does
not
purport
to
contain
anything
more
than
a
synopsis
of
whatever
happened
in
that
police
car.
the
police
officers,
when
they
took
the
stand
in
the
mini-suppression
hearing
that
was
held
in
this
case,
simply
were
not
asked
precisely
what
they
said.
they
simply
summarized,
in
a
sentence
or
two,
the
general
tenor
of
their
conversation.
the
most
we
have
are
a
few
details,
and
those
details,
i
would
suggest,
are
purely
emotionally
evocative.
officer
gleckman
apparently
talked
in
terms
of,
"gee,
it
would
be
too
bad.
perhaps
some
one--a
little
girl,
perhaps--would
kill
herself."
not
merely
injure
herself,
but
kill
herself.
and
a
second
officer
provided
what
one
might
cynically
term
counterpoint
to
that
saying,
"gee,
that
really
is
too
bad.
we
really
need
to
find
the
gun."
i'm
not
trying
to
suggest
that
the
record
in
this
case
evokes
visions
of
thumb
screws.
but
what
i
am
trying
to
suggest
is
that
it
is
very
hard
to
tell
what
happened
in
that
car,
but
that
the
details
that
we
do
have--and
one
is
forced
to
draw
inferences
from
very
few
details--is
that
[illegible
words]
of
a
[illegible
words]
and--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i'm
certain
that
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
was
concerned
about
its
ability
to
essentially
read
officer
gleckman's
mind
through
the
printed
page,
especially
when
that
printed
page
is
very
short.
i
don't
believe,
however,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
they
were
adding
an
additional
tier
of
prophylactic
protections.
i
think
instead
they
took
a
reading
of
the
record,
informed
by
their
own
experience
in
rhode
island,
based
on
a
number
of
confession
cases
where
there
have
been--where
the
providence
police
have
used
psychological
ploys
to
extract
information.
and
they
concluded,
on
the
basis
of
the
limited
record
before
them,
that
first
of
all,
this
conversation
was
in
their
words
"subtly
compelling."
they
also
used
the
words,
it
constituted
psychological
pressure.
i
think
secondly--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
believe
it's
clearly
wrong
under
miranda.
i
would
suggest
that
miranda
was
founded
on
a
two-part
predicate.
first,
that
the
suspect
be
in
custody;
and
secondly,
that
the
suspect
be
subjected
to
some
further
pressure.
it's
clear
even
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
a
simple
question
by
a
police
officer
to
a
suspect
in
custody
will
amount
to
interrogation.
if,
for
instance,
did
the
police
officers
in
this
case
had
said,
"thomas
innis,
please,
we're
worried
about
the
little
kids,
and
could
you
possibly--of
course,
we
won't
hurt
you--tell
you
where
the
shotgun
is?"
i
think
there'd
be
no
doubt
that
this
would
fall
within
a
technical
definition
of
interrogation
of
miranda.
and
i
have
major
trouble
seeing
the
difference--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
think
the
roscoe
v.
texas
involved
a
one
or
two
sentence
interrogation,
and
this
court
found
that
to
be
interrogation.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
that
was
interrogation
on--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
the
reason
for
saying
no,
i
think,
is
really
in
two
parts.
first
of
all,
i
think
a
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
routine
administrative
questioning,
where
in
general--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
those
words
always
trouble
me,
but
perhaps
that's
fair.
but
i
think
the
point
that
should
be
drawn
from
your
hypothetical
is,
in
the
situations
where,
in
general,
it
is
unlikely
that
the
police
or
other
law
enforcement
agencies
are
seeking
to
gain
incriminating
information,
it
is
highly
questionable
as
to
whether
miranda
applies.
i
mean,
i
think
in
effect
the
court
has
said
much
[illegible
words]
pronounce
the
rule
that
the
court--that
society
has
a
right
to
everyone's
evidence;
and
they
operate,
and
they
say
that
the
prosecution
may
operate
on
the
presumption,
when
a
witness
goes
before
a
grand
jury,
that
that
witness
first
of
all
will
not
be
incriminating
himself,
and
secondly,
that
the
prosecutor
in
fact
is
not
trying
to
incriminate
that
witness.
and
that
is
the
major
reason
for
holding
that
they
need
not
be
given
miranda
warnings,
at
least
in
certain
circumstances.
so
where
you're
talking
about
simple
administrative
processing,
absent
some
showing
that
it
in
fact
was
some
kind
of
a
ploy
to
gain
incriminating
information,
i
think
a
strong
argument
could
be
mounted
that
that
would
not
constitute
interrogation
within
the
meaning
of
miranda,
even
though
in
fact
in
that
case
questions
were
asked
of
the
suspect.
i
think
that,
in
regard
to--the
attorney
general
has
also
mentioned
here
that
the
span
of
time
is
a
very
short
one,
indicating
that
somehow
this
means
that
the
pressures
on
innis
were
less.
and
he
has
contrasted
this
case
with
brewer,
where
there
was
a
ride
of
several
hours
duration.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
would
use
brewer
in
this
case
simply
as
illustrative
of
another
fact
situation.
i'm
not
trying
to
suggest
that
the
legal
rule
in
that
case
turns
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
coercion.
but
the
attorney
general
here
has
suggested
that
because--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
to
the
best
of
my
understanding
of
the
opinion,
it
was
that
he
was
in
fact
indicted,
that--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
that
he
was
out
on
bail.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
and
instead
of
going
through
an
attorney,
just
as
a
civil
lawyer
would
always
contact
the
lawyer
on
the
other
side
rather
than
going
directly
to
the
client,
they
set
him
up.
and
certainly
that
did
not
involve
coercion
in
any
sense
of
the
term.
and
it
was
a
conversation
between
friends,
one
of
whom
proved
to
be
false.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
or
a
good
friends,
depending
on
your
point
of
view.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
suggest
that
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
simply
used
brewer
as
an
illustrative
case.
it
clearly
noted
that
brewer
was
a
sixth
amendment
case,
and
it
was
deciding
innis
on
fifth
amendment
grounds.
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
there
are
certain
aspects
of
brewer
that
bear
relevance
to
innis,
without
attempting
a
one-to-one
correspondence.
as
mr.
justice
powell
noted
in
his
concurrence
in
brewer,
that
the
fact
of
interrogation,
and
the
fact
of
some
degree
of
pressure
in
that
interrogation
was
potentially
crucial
to
the
question
of
whether
there
had
been
a
voluntary
waiver
in
that
case
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
brewer
is
useful
to
the
decision
of
this
case
insofar
as
it
discusses
a
factual
problem
concerning
psychological
pressure.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
think
he
can
rely
on
those.
as
i
was
about
to
suggest,
i
think
that
the
dissimilarities
in
time
between
innis
and
brewer
are
deceiving;
that
i
would
point
out
that
in
many
decisions
discussing
the
activities
of
police
officers
at
the
moment
of
arrest,
this
court
has
very
carefully
recognized
the
extreme
degree
of
stress
that
the
police
officers
undergo;
that
street
encounters
are
inherently
dangerous
things.
i
would
simply
ask
this
court
to
extend
that
to
the
suspect
as
well;
that
from
the
suspect's
point
of
view,
it
is
a
highly
stressful
situation,
and
without
trying
to
push
this
too
far,
i
would
suggest
that
the
facts--that
the
events
in
innis
proceeded
one-two-three,
the
whole
sequence
of
events,
from
his
request
for
counsel
to
his
second
admission
to
captain
leyden
was
probably
less
than
ten
minutes.
i
would
say
that
things
were
happening
so
fast
that
if
anything
they
aggravated
the
pressures
in
the
situation,
rather
than
minimized
them.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
would
agree
that
the
primary,
and
perhaps
most
crucial
question
here,
is
whether
innis'
miranda
rights
were
violated
initially.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
that
if
they
were
not,
that
if
he
in
fact,
in
that
police
car,
spontaneously
volunteered
to
lead
the
police
to
the
shotgun,
it
is
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
that's
correct.
in
that--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
no,
i
would
agree
that
interrogation
is
interrogation,
regardless
of
what
the
legal
pigeonhole
is.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
think
that
is
a
harder
question.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that's
a
harder
question,
and
i
would
answer
it
in
this
way.
that
while
on
the
one
hand,
miranda--i
believe
that
the
thrust
of
miranda
was
to
provide
extraordinary
protection,
where
a
suspect
is
both
in
custody
and
subjected
to
some
kind
of
pressure--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
but
what
i
was
going
to
add
is,
i
think
there
is
a
second
prong
to
miranda,
which
comes
into
play
where
a
suspect
has
invoked
his
rights.
where
you're
talking
about
the
so-called
second-stage
protections
of
miranda,
you're
talking
about
a
requirement
that
the
police
scrupulously
honor
the
invocation
of
the
right.
and
i
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
understanding
how
police
who
surreptitiously
seek
to
gain
information
from
a
suspect,
while
that
suspect
is
totally
unaware
that
they
are
in
fact
doing
that,
are
in
any
sense
of
the
english
language,
scrupulously
honoring
his
rights.
and
that
requirement
is
part
of
miranda
as
further
explicated
by
mosley.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
would
find
it
a
very
hard
case.
i
think--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
that
they
are
precisely
the
same?
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
they're
precisely
the
same.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
if
the
dispatcher
was
aware
that
innis
was
in
the
car,
i
would
say
it's
precisely
the
same
case.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
assuming
he
was
not,
i
would
see
it
as
a
different
case,
and
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
apply
the
miranda
rationale
to
it.
i
think
the
reasons
for
that
is,
that
even
taking
an
objective
test
for
interrogation,
which
is
the
test
that
we
argued
for
in
this
case,
that
a
dispatcher
making
that
message
could
hardly
be
deemed
to
have
felt
it
was
likely
that
his
comments
would
induce
an
incriminating
response.
now,
if,
for
instance,
the
dispatcher
had
said--had
essentially
uttered
a
threat
over
the
radio,
if
the
dispatcher
had
said
something
to
the
effect
that
either
you
guys
find
that
gun
or
else
innis
is
a
dead
man
by
the
time
he
gets
back
to
the
station,
i
would
still
have
difficulty
analyzing
that
under
miranda,
but
i
would
suggest
that
in
all
probability
any
incrimination
would
be
involuntary
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
as
i
think
the
general
tenor
of
the
arguments
have
indicated
here,
the
really
crucial
problem
is
the
content
of
this
conversation.
we
suggest
that
absent
an
actual
admission
of
intent
by
the
police,
the
standard
must
be
an
objective
one
that
it's
rarely
easy--subjective
intent
is
rarely
an
easy
issue,
and
that
the
motivations
of
officers
are
usually
complex,
they're
many
faceted.
and
in
fact,
an
officer
testifying
a
year
later
might
well
not
even
know
precisely
why
he
uttered
the
comments
he
did.
i
would
merely,
and
requestfully,
suggest
the
trial
court
shouldn't
be
required
to
guess
whether
a
police
officer's
motivation,
or
his
testimony
as
to
those
motivations,
are
accurate
or
merely
convenient.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
none
of
them
purported
to
do,
but
the
record--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
that
is
correct.
but
there
is
no
further
evidence
about
what
they
intended
to
do.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
yes,
i
think
it's--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
--entirely
clear
on
that
point.
in
attempting
to
resolve
this
question,
and
resolve
the
question
of
whether
this
interrogation
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
subtly
compelling,
and
by
inference,
therefore,
intended
to
be
compelling,
i
think
that
the
court
should
note
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
factual
findings
of
a
state
court
of
last
resort
served
to
uphold
the
federal
right.
in
those
circumstances,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that,
if
not
binding
on
this
court,
they
should
be
given
extreme
deference.
the
bottom
line
of
what
i'm
saying
is,
this
court
should
take
this
case
as
the
supreme
court
decided
it,
and
not
create
a
different
case
on
the
facts;
and
then
leading
the
court
to
a
different
conclusion.
if
it
is
assumed
that
thomas
innis
was
in
fact
subjected
to
psychological
pressure,
i
think
that
the
argument
that
a
clear
miranda
violation
has
occurred
follows
directly;
that
this
simply
is
not
a
situation
where
they
scrupulously
honored
his
rights.
it
is
a
situation
where
the
record
shows
no
more
than
warnings,
followed
by
a
request
for
counsel,
followed
by
psychological
pressure,
followed
by
an
admission.
that
satisfied
neither
the
waiver
standard,
nor
miranda's
per
se
rule.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i'm
equating
the
two.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
yes,
but
by--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
there
was
custody.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
and
by
interrogation,
i
mean
some
further
pressure.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
think
that
as
the
miranda
court
noted,
much
of
modern
police
interrogative
procedures
are
psychologically
oriented.
and
i
simply
cannot
believe
that
they
are
limited
to
questions.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
think
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
there
was
interrogation
is
a
question
of
law,
but
oftentimes
it
will
be
determined
by
findings
of
fact.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
would
suggest
that
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
made
several
very
clear
findings
of
fact.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
would
suggest--
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
based
its
conclusion
that
this
was
interrogation
within
the
meaning
of
miranda
on
essentially
two
findings
of
fact,
one
of
them
made
very
clearly;
and
that
is,
that
objectively
speaking,
the
comments
in
the
car
were
compelling;
that
they
concluded
that
it
was
psychological
pressure,
and
therefore
it
was
interrogation.
implicit
in
that
is
an
objective
standard
that
the
police
should
be
held
to
intend
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
their
acts,
in
effect.
we
argued
in
the
brief
for
an
ultimately
objective
determination
of
intent,
where
intent
is
disputed
on
the
record.
i
believe
my
time's
expired.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
attempt
to
be
very
rapid
here.
if
it
is
concluded
that
thomas
innis
was
interrogated
within
the
meaning
of
miranda,
it
is
our
contention
that
both
of
his
subsequent
admissions
must
fall.
i
think
that,
especially
regarding
the
second
admission,
where
the
police
claimed
that
innis
later
waived
his
rights,
we
would
simply
argue
that
a
fresh
set
of
warnings
only
minutes
after
the
violation
occurred
essentially
cannot
undo
the
harm
already
done.
in
this
instance,
the
record
makes
abundantly
clear
that
captain
leyden
scrupulously
honored
the
suspect's
rights.
the
problem
is
that
officer
gleckman
did
not.
and
effectively,
that
if
a
second
rendition
of
miranda
warnings
served
to
insulate
from
judicial
censure
a
violation
that
took
place
minutes
previously,
there
would
be
literally
no
incentive
to
obey
the
mandate
of
miranda
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
well,
and
testimony
regarding
two
incriminating
admissions
made
by
innis.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
they
were,
in
effect,
two
agreements
to
lead
innis
to
the
shotgun.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
no;
the
record
indicates
no.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
yes,
both
his
oral
and
actual
physical
contact.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
the
state
raised
inevitable
discovery
on
a
petition
for
reargument
that
was
denied
on
procedural
grounds.
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
never
reached
the
issue
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
and
i
would
suggest
that
at
least
on
the
present
record,
the
issue
is
not
capable
of
factual
resolution,
let
alone
legal
resolution.
while
it
is
clear
that
the
shotgun
was
reasonably
near
by,
it
is
unclear
how,
in
effect,
successfully
it
was
concealed.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
on
a
reading
of
the
record,
that
it
was
concealed
in
some
field
under
some
rocks.
i
don't
know
whether
one
would
have
to
excavate
the
entire
area
to
find
it.
mr.
john
a.
macfadyen,
iii
no,
and
in
that
regard,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
it
is
really
the
oral
testimony
that
we're
most
concerned
with.
the
shotgun
itself
is
probative
only
insofar
as
it
is
linked
to
thomas
innis.
and
while
the
state
has
made
an
issue
of--a
brief
issue
of
harmless
error,
i
think
it
overlooks
this
signal
point,
that
if
the
admissions
were
obtained
in
violation
of
miranda,
then
the
gun,
in
many
respects,
is
virtually
de
minimus.
