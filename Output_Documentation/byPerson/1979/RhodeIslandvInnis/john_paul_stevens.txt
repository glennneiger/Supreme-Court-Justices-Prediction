justice
john
paul
stevens
and
massiah
deals
with
something
quite
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
roberts,
following
up
on
the
chief
justice's
point,
the
trial
judge
specifically
said,
we
have
three
officers
who
are
out
at
four
in
the
morning
or
later,
and
have
been
prowling
around
searching
for
a
weapon
which
they
had
reason
to
believe
was
there.
these
very
men,
i
understood,
were
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
locating
that
weapon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
the
trial
judge
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
looking
for
the
weapon.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
a
fact
that
the
trial
judge's
decision
was
based
on
waiver.
that's
the
reason
the
trial
judge--he
says
in
so
many
words
that
it
was
a
waiver,
clearly,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
i
have
heard,
an
intelligent
waiver
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
and
he
did
not
make
any
finding
one
way
or
another
on
the
issue
of
interrogation,
whereas
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
in
effect
asking
us
to
make
a
new
finding
of
fact
on
the
question
of
interrogation;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
who
should
make
the
finding
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
the
grounds
of
his
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
clearly
stated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
did
not
pass
on
a
finding
of
interrogation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
did
decide
the
question,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
characterize
it
as
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
roberts,
there's
this
difference,
i
suppose,
that
the
suggestion
the
chief
justice
makes,
it
would
have
been
new
information
to
the
police.
but
you're
talking
about
here
three
police
who
had
previously
been
searching
for
the
gun
and
were
familiar
with
the
area
which
makes
it
a
little
different
from
the
hypothesis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
holding
are
you
relying
on
of
this
court
for
that
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
he
was
out
on
bail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
talking
to
a
supposed
friend.
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me,
just
to
pursue
that
point,
that
although
all
the
courts
resolved
the
interrogation
issue
in
the
same
way,
that
was
an
initial
basic
question
that
had
to
be
put
to
one
side
before
you
reached
the
waiver
issue.
you
first
had
to
decide
there
was
interrogation.
and
there
was
a
powerful
argument
to
the
contrary
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
had
made.
so
although
it's
true
that
everybody,
all
the
courts
decided
it,
the
fact
that
the
interrogation
issue
in
both
cases
is
very
similar
makes
the
analysis
in
brewer
quite
relevant
here,
it
seems
to
me.
because
you
don't
take
the
position,
do
you,
that
the
interrogation--the
question
whether
there's
interrogation
differs
under
the
sixth
or
the
fifth
amendments?
i
mean,
on
the
interrogation
issue,
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
massiah
case
or
a
miranda
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
use
the
term
"psychological
pressure."
really,
it
has
to
be
followed
by
interrogation,
doesn't
it?
are
you
equating
the
terms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
but
it
is
critical
to
your
case
that
there
have
been
interrogation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
placed
in
custody--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
then
add
interrogation
to
custody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that
whether
or
not
there
was
interrogation
is
a
question
of
law
or
a
question
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
don't
have
any
findings
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
rejected
the
contention
that
no
interrogation
occurred
because
the
defendant
was
not
addressed
personally.
in
other
words,
they
rejected,
apparently,
a
contention
that
there
be
a
per
se
rule
that
you
must
reject--but
i
don't
find
they
made
any
findings
of
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nor
did
the
trial
court.
he
found
waiver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
gun
would
inevitably
have
been
discovered,
that
wouldn't
answer
the
problem
about
the
oral
testimony
linking
the
defendant
to
the
gun?
