mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
this
morning
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
directed
to
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
thomas
innis,
was
found
guilty
of
kidnapping,
robbery
and
murder
by
a
superior
court,
sitting
with
a
jury,
on
november
12th,
1975.
during
that
trial,
the
superior
court
had
denied
a
motion
to
suppress
a
shotgun
that
had
been
seized
under
the
circumstances
that
give
rise
to
this
petition
for
certiorari.
the
case
began
on
midnight,
or
shortly
after
midnight,
of
january
16th,
1975.
a
cab
driver
named
aubin
complained
to
the
providence
police
department
that
he'd
been
assaulted
by
a
man
carrying
a
sawed
off
shotgun.
while
he
was
in
the
police
department
giving
a
statement,
he
observed
a
photograph
of
the
respondent,
thomas
innis,
on
a
bulletin
board
in
the
police
department,
and
spontaneously
identified
his
assailant
as
thomas
innis.
the
police
put
out
a
bulletin
for
a
search
in
the
area
of
the
city
of
providence
where
the
cab
driver
had
dropped
innis
off,
the
mt.
pleasant
area.
at
about
4:30
in
the
morning,
a
patrol
officer
on
chalkstone
avenue
in
the
city
of
providence
saw
innis
on
a
sidewalk
and
apprehended
him,
handcuffed
him,
and
gave
him
his
miranda
warning.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
a
cab
driver
had
been
shot
and
killed,
your
honor.
the
case
which
is
before
the
court
this
morning
involves
the
shooting
and
killing
of
that
cab
driver,
who
at
that
time
had
not
yet--the
body
had
not
yet
been
discovered.
the
first
patrol
officer
gave
innis
his
miranda
warnings
for
the
first
time.
within
a
few
minutes
after
that,
a
sergeant
arrived
and
gave
miranda--gave
miranda
warnings
for
the
second
time
to
innis.
within
two
or
three
minutes
after
that,
the
commanding--the
night
commander
of
the
providence
police
department
at
that
time,
captain
leyden,
arrived
on
the
scene
and
gave
innis
his
miranda
warnings
for
the
third
time.
at
that
time,
innis
asserted
his
right
to
have
counsel,
at
which
point
captain
leyden
directed
that
all
interrogation
cease,
that
he
be
placed
in
a
caged
police
car
with
three
police
officers,
and
taken
to
the
central
police
station.
this
was
done.
he
was
also
specifically
advised,
i
should
point
out,
that
the--the
suspect
not
be
interrogated
on
the
way
to
the
police
station,
and
that
there
be
no
conversation,
no
questioning,
directed
to
him.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
there
were
two
police
officers
in
the
front
seat,
your
honor--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
--
and
one
in
the
cage
with
thomas
innis.
along
the
way
--
they
had
gone
approximately
two
minutes,
and
traveled
approximately
one-half
mile
to
a
mile--at
that
point
the
police
officer
on
the
passenger
side
of
the
front
seat
said
to
the
police
officer
in
the
driver's
seat,
it
would
be
a
shame--and
i'm
giving
the
substance
of
what
he
said
now;
i'm
not
attempting
to
quote--it
would
be
a
shame
if
one
of
the
retarded
children
who
goes
to
the
school
for
the
handicapped
in
this
neighborhood
should
find
that
gun
and
hurt
himself.
at
that
point,
thomas
innis,
to
whom
this
had
not
been
directed
as
an
interrogatory,
volunteered
-
okay,
take
me
back
to
the
scene;
i'm
going
to
show
you
where
the
gun
is.
thomas
innis
was
taken
back
to
the
scene.
captain
leyden
who
was
still
there,
removed
him
from
the
back
seat
of
the
caged
vehicle,
and
gave
him
for
the
fourth
time
his
miranda
rights.
at
that
point,
thomas
innis
said
no,
i
would
like
to
show
you
where
the
gun
is.
i'm
concerned
that
some
of
the
handicapped
children
at
the
school
for
the
retarded
in
this
neighborhood
might
get
hurt.
thereupon,
he
took
the
police
officers
into
a
field,
and
after
a
little
bit
of
looking
for
it,
they
located
the
sawed
off
shotgun.
he
was
subsequently
charged
with
the
murder
of
john
mulvaney,
the
cab
driver
who
had
been
missing
at
this
point
for
three
or
four
days.
he
was
found
guilty
of
kidnapping,
robbery
and
murder.
the
sole
issue
before
the
court
this
morning
is
the
question
of
suppression
of
the
shotgun.
now,
in
a
3-2
opinion,
which
reversed
the
conviction
of
the
trial
court,
the
majority
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
relied
heavily
on
the
brewer
case,
brewer
v.
williams.
now,
brewer
of
course
specifically
failed
to
consider
the
miranda
doctrine,
or
the
voluntariness
of
williams'
statement.
miranda
played
no
part
in
brewer,
which
strictly
was
a
sixth
amendment
case.
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
brewer,
the
key
to
invocation
of
sixth
amendment
rights
must
be,
the
commencement
of
some
kind
of
judicial
proceedings,
as
clearly
existed
in
brewer.
he,
of
course,
had
been
arrested;
he
had
been
arraigned,
he
was
represented
by
two
counsel;
he
was
charged;
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
des
moines
for
further
proceedings.
none
of
that
is
applicable
in
innis.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
this
is
true,
the
question
is
whether
there--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
well,
i
think
there
are
several
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
if
there
was
no
interrogation,
i
win.
however--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
no,
it
wasn't;
it
was
clearly
interrogation
involved.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
fact,
detective--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
detective
captain
leeming
conceded
that
his
purpose
was
interrogation--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
--in
that
case.
so
we--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that
is
right.
well,
waiver
can
become
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
if
the
court
concludes
that
there
was
interrogation.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
the
state's
position
is,
basically,
there
was
no
custodial
interrogation.
we
don't
dispute
custody,
but
we
do
dispute
interrogation.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
if
there
had
been
by
some
action
of
the
police--he
had
scrupulously
observed
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
accused--if
there
had
been
some
custodial
interrogation,
there
was
certainly
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
by
innis
on
two
occasions
-
first,
in
the
squad
car,
and
secondly,
when
he
returned--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that's
absolutely
correct.
the--and
the
question
of
interrogation,
of
course
it
seems
to
me,
should
turn
on
the
question
of
intent
to
elicit
an
incriminating
response.
in
other
words,
were
these
police
officers
intending
to
trick
the
man?
there
is
much
argument
in
respondent's
briefs
in
support
of
the
conclusion
that
this
was
a
skillful
interrogative
trick
by
a
skillful
police
officer.
it
overlooks
the
fact
that
according
to
the
record,
officer
gleckman,
i
believe
it
is,
who
was
the
officer
who
made
the
statement,
had
gone
on
the
providence
police
department
in
19--november
of
1973.
these
events
transpired
in
january
of
1975.
he
had
been
a
patrol
officer.
he
was
not,
as
captain
leeming
was
in
brewer
for
example,
a
skilled
interrogator.
the
duration
of
the
trip
was,
i
think
they
said,
two
or
three
minutes,
and
a
half-mile
to
one
mile.
there
was
apparently
an
off-handed
remark
made
by
one
officer
to
another.
there
was
no
attempt
here
by
a
skilled
interrogator
to
go
after
a
known
psychological
weakness,
if
you
will,
of
a
man
who
was
known
to
be
an
escaped
mental
patient
and
a
religious
fanatic.
all
of
the
elements
that
applied
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
undoubtedly
an
interrogation
in
brewer
do
not
apply
in
innis.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
rhode
island
supreme
court's
reliance,
the
majority's
reliance,
on
brewer,
they're
both
doctrinally
and
factually
way
off
base.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
on
that
grounds
alone,
the
decision
of
the
majority
in
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
cannot
stand.
when
you
get
into
miranda
questions,
the
accepted
standards
of
miranda,
the
state
submits,
could
lead
to
the
mandate
of
a
reversal.
because
we
don't
have
interrogation;
we
do
have
a
waiver.
and
further,
the
application
of
a
per
se
exclusionary
rule,
the
extension
of
wong
sun
to
the
miranda
procedural
safeguards
under
the
fifth
amendment,
simply
is
not
justified
by
the
teachings
of
this
court,
and
is
not
justified
by
principle.
as
we
go
through
the
steps,
everything
that
could
be
found
to
support
the
respondent's
position,
and
support
the
views
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
falls.
if
there
were
interrogation,
there
would
be
a
waiver.
if
there
were
an
interrogation
and
there
were
no
waiver,
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
automatically
applied
in
this
case,
because
the
exclusionary
rule
should
turn
on
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
the
case
and
the
reliability
of
the
evidence,
and
not
upon
a
mere
per
se
extension
of
wong
sun,
fifth
amendment,
and
beyond
fifth
amendment,
into
the
exclusionary--into
the
prophylactic
safeguards
of
miranda.
so
under
all
of
these
miranda-type
tests,
the
supreme
court
decision
below
cannot
stand.
there
is
another
interesting
alternative,
which
is
proposed,
by
professor
granno--professor
granno,
in
a
criminal
law
review
article,
this
past
summer's
issue
of
the
criminal
law
review,
17
american
criminal
law
review
page
1,
he
discusses
what
he
refers
to
there
as
the
rationale
approach
to
miranda.
he
distinguishes
that
from
what
i've
been
discussing
during
the
last
few
minutes,
that
is,
the
black
letter
approach,
he
called,
to
miranda.
the
rationale
approach,
as
i
read
it,
is
essentially
a
voluntariness
test
of
miranda.
and
what
it
turns
on--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
yes,
it
certainly
would,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
suspect
that
probably
lurks
around
in
the
back
of
professor
granno's
mind
somewhere,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
and
mine?
well,
your
honor,
from
the
point
of
view
of
prosecution,
i
feel--i
feel
that
this
court
can
appropriately
reserve
the
decision
below
merely
by
consideration
of
miranda
standards.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
wished
to
pursue
something
like
professor
granno
is
suggesting
in
his
rationale
approach,
a
voluntariness
test,
we
certainly
have
no--we
would
have
no
objection
to
the
court
proceeding
on
that
ground.
i
think
it's
a
perfectly
valid--perfectly
valid
grounds
for
decision,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
this
man
was
not
charged;
we
did
not
have
the
commencement
of
any
criminal--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
he
was
in
custody,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
there
had
been
no
formal
arraignment;
there'd
been
no
formal
charge.
he
was
being
brought
to
the
station.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
which
has
extended
back
to
the
point
of
custody
the--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
it
certainly
does;
it
certainly
does.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
violation
of
sixth
amendment
rights--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
mr.
justice
white,
that's
correct,
yes,
sir.
it's
a
fifth
amendment
case,
and
as
professor--i
think
excellent
language
illustrating
the
purpose
of
miranda
is
professor
granno's
article--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
believe
that
brewer
is
irrelevant.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that
is
correct,
the--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
no
commencement
of
judicial
proceedings,
which
is
the
key
to
the
commencement
of
your
sixth
amendment
rights,
under
massiah
or
under
brewer.
now,
there
is
some,
i
guess,
scholarly
debate
about
whether
or
not
you
should
extend
back
to
the
point
of
custody
the
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
yes.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
miranda
is
not.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
correct.
interrogation
is
at
the
very
heart
of
miranda,
and
it's
the
very
heart
of
innis,
now,
in
the
innis
case.
we
are
facing
a
situation
where
innis
had
overheard
an
observation
made
by
policeman
a
to
policeman
b.
it
wasn't
the
christian
burial
speechin
the
sense
of
a
160-mile
drive
with
a
texas
captain
who
prides
himself
on
being
a
skillful
interrogator,
preying
on
the
weakness,
if
you
will,
developing
an
inherent
coercion
on
williams
who
was
in
that
car.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
oh,
brewer
clearly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
involved
interrogation.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
it
did
not
involve
an
issue
of
interrogation.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
the
court
majority,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
professor
white--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
--would
extend
your
honor
the--he
would
make
the
case
a
sixth
amendment
case.
i
believe
there's
nothing
in
the
doctrines
taught
by
this
court,
nor
is
there
anything--any
matter
of
principle
which
would
call
for
that
conclusion.
to
extend
sixth
amendment
rights
back
to
the
point
of
custody
would,
i
think,
be
clearly
detrimental
public
policy
in
the
effect
it
would
have
on
law
enforcement
to
function
at
the
scene
of
an
investigation.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
whole
purpose
of
miranda
and
its
warnings
is
to
reduce
the
pressure
of
custodial
interrogation.
now,
if
there
was
interrogation
here,
then
we'd
have
to
move
on
to
the
question
of
was
there
waiver,
or
should
the
per
se
exclusionary
rule
be
applied.
but
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
a
few
moments
ago,
if
there
is
no
interrogation
here,
if
the
statements
by
patrolman
a
to
patrolman
b,
"i
hope
none
of
the
children
at
the
school
for
the
handicapped
are
injured,"
if
that
doesn't
constitute
improper
custodial
interrogation,
then
the
respondent's
whole
position
is
lost.
the--the--there
must
be
some
finding
that
that
did
constitute
interrogation.
and
while
there's
much
argument
about
it,
i
would
point
out
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
only
silent
on
the
inquisitorial
intent
behind
that
remark;
in
fact,
the
record
goes
the
other
way.
the
record
suggests
that
this
was
just
casual
conversation,
"i
happened
to
say
to
him,"
or
something
like
that.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
no,
your
honor,
it's--i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
suggesting
that
he
was
a
patrol
officer
who
patrolled
that
area,
and
would
have
five
different
concerns
on
his
mind
than
would
detective
captain
leeming
in
brewer,
or
detective
captain
leyden,
for
that
matter,
here.
i
think
if
detective
captain
leyden
had
made
a--had
gotten
into
this
kind
of
a
dialogue,
it
might
well
have
been
with
a
whole
different
intent,
and
with
a
whole
different
constitutional
meaning.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
this
officer
was--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
this
officer
was
interested
in
discharging
what
he
was
ordered
to
do,
and
that
is,
take
the
man
to
the
station
without
asking
him
any
questions.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
he
didn't
ask
him
any
questions,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
the
man
volunteered.
the
man
said,
"take
me
back;
i'll
show
you
the
gun."
he
was
then
given
his
rights
for
the
fourth
time
outside
the
police
car.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
well,
of
course
that
is
what
respondent
is
attempting
to
provoke
the
court
to
believe.
the--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
well,
the
point--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
well,
the--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
they're
police
officers;
no
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i'm
not
trying
to
make
them
unqualified.
i'm
suggesting
to
mister--to
the
court,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
we
have
a
situation
that
prevails
here,
where
these
men
were
instructed
to
do
a
specific
thing.
they're
patrol
officers,
they're
not
detectives.
i'm
drawing
a
distinction
that
i
believe
exists
here
between--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
think
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
evidence
that
it
has
inquisitorial
intent.
and
that's
totally
absent
here.
in
fact,
these
people--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
these
men--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
they
were
in
fact--they
were
in
fact
discussing
a
gun,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
his
gun.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
they
were
discussing
his
gun.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that's
what
they
said.
they
said
it
would
be
a
shame
if
some
small
child,
going
to
the
school
for
the
handicapped
up
the
hill
here--i
think
that's
vastly
different
on
the
facts
than
the
christian
burial
speech,
may
it
please
your
honor
because
it
was
not--as
i
say,
it
was
not
of
a
great
duration;
it
was
not
on
a
long
ride.
the
one--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
it
was
not
directed
to
innis.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
yes.
yes,
exactly.
that's
true,
mr.
justice--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
the
testimony--well,
the
trip
they
were
instructed
to
make
was
considerably
longer
than
what
eventually
happened.
they
travelled
a
half-mile.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
a
half-mile
to
a
mile,
the
record
suggests.
and
they
were
gone,
there's
reference
to
a
couple
of
minutes,
a
few
minutes.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
they
turned
around
when
the--when
innis
volunteered
to
go
back.
they
turned
around,
went
back
to
the
scene.
the
captain
then
removed
him
from
the--from
the
back
seat
of
the
squad
car;
once
again
gave
him
the
miranda
warnings;
and
he
replied,
"no,
i
want
to
show
you
where
the
gun
is.
i
know
my
rights,
but
i
want
to
take
you
to
where
the
gun
is."
which
gets
into
point
number
two
-
if,
in
fact,
that
did
constitute
an
interrogation,
here
is
the
second
waiver
of
whatever
rights
may
have
accrued
to
him
under
miranda.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
don't
know
what
the
state
of
his
knowledge
was,
your
honor.
but
he
certainly--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
in
that
weather.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
submit,
your
honor,
under
what
i
would
expect
to
be
the
ordinary
standards
of
police
work,
they
probably--their
duty
should
be
to
carry
out
the
directions
of
their
superior
officer.
in
the
innis
case--i
have
no
information
at
all
about
brewer,
obviously--in
the
innis
case
the
commanding
officer
had
other
policemen
at
the
scene
who
were
doing
continuing
investigative
work.
these
three
men
were
directed
to
take
innis
to
the
central
station.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
no,
these
three
men
had
been--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
these
three
men
had
been
at
the
scene.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
looking
for
the
weapon;
they
had
been.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that's
correct,
mr.
justice--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
no.
well,
no--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
the
issue
of
waiver
was
certainly
paramount
in
the
trial
judge's
decision.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
yes,
yes.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
he
found
a
waiver
to
exist.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
exactly;
exactly.
i
don't
believe
that
on
the
record
before
this
court
that
it
constitutes
making
a
new
finding
of
fact
to
determine
that--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
they--yes.
they
decided--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
believe
they
treated
it
essentially
as
a
question
of
law.
because
i
felt--i
believe
that
they
were
mandated--they
believed
that
they
were
mandated
by
the
brewer
case
to
conclude
that
this
was
an
interrogation.
i
believe
that
they
automatically
applied,
if
you
will,
the
christian
burial
speech,
despite
the
numerous
factual
distinctions,
and
the
fact
it
was
a
sixth
amendment
case.
they
applied
that--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
correct.
no,
i
think
the
interrogation
issue
and
the
waiver
issue
do,
clearly,
stand
as
separate
issues--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
--waiver
being
subsequent
in
my
view
to--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
believe
it's
a
question
of
law,
as
it
is
before
this
court.
i
believe
interrogation
certainly
could
be
a
question
of
fact
in
the
superior
court.
when
the
supreme
court
gets
it
and
applies
brewer
and
says,
brewer--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
would
ask
you
to
adopt
the
rule
that
unless
it's
directed
at
the
defendant,
and
unless
it's
interrogative
in
nature--it
doesn't
have
to
have
a
question
make
at
the
end--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
correct.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
if
it
was
intended
to
bring
forth
a
response?
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
and
it
was
not
directed--well,
then
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
to
find
that
in
fact
it
was
directed
at
the
defendant.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
yes,
because
then
i
think
you
would
say
that
that
was,
in
fact,
directed
at
the
defendant.
it
doesn't
have
to--i
don't
have
to
say,
"mr.
jones."
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
in
fact--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
no,
that
didn't
happen
here,
your
honor?
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
it
was
not
directed
at
him,
and
in
fact,
all
the
testimony--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
but
it
was
not
directed
at
him
in
real
or
implied
fashion,
and
i
think
all
the
record
evidence--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
because
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that
conclusion.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
if
i
may
say
so
respectfully,
i
think
misread
brewer
in
such
a
way
that
they
felt
the
christian
burial
speech
holding
in
brewer
mandated
a
finding
that
anything
which
is
said,
which
elicits
a
response,
whether
or
not
it's
directed,
intentionally
or
unintentionally,
at
the
defendant,
that
that's
going
to
be
sufficient
to
call
for
invocation
of
miranda.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
there
is
a--the
superior
court
finding,
your
honor
is
correct,
goes
to
the
question
of
waiver;
it
does
not
involve
a
finding
of
fact.
but
i
submit
that
all
the
record
evidence
on
which
the
rhode
island
court
based
its
decision
is
on
the--is
assuming
that
as
a
matter
of
law
brewer
mandates
the
conclusion
that
this
is
an
interrogatory.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i'm
troubled
by
that--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that's
very
interesting,
and
certainly
is
very
likely
true.
i'm
troubled
by
the
fact
that
detective
captain
leeming
admits
in
brewer
that
in
fact
his
purpose
was
to
interrogate.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that's
quite
true.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
except
for
the
fact
that
the
federal
marshall
was
sitting
a
block
away.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
it
was
just
a
statement--a
statement
he
made
that
was
incriminating
and
overheard
by
the
marshall
because
the
friend
was
in
cooperation--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
i
believe
the
intent
and
the
constitutional
meaning
of
both
statements
would
be
the
same,
yes.
yes,
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
the
court's
leave,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
the
question,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
stevens,
still
goes
back
to
the
question
of
intent
to
interrogate.
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
points.
essentially,
my
brother's
argument
rests
in
whole
on
the
fact
that
miranda
precludes
interrogation
under
stressful
conditions,
which
he
reads
that
of
course,
it
seems
to
me,
to
be
any
observation
made
after
the
time
of
custody.
in
other
words,
after
the
man
has
been
in
custody
and
once
asserted
his
miranda
rights,
it
seems
to
me
the
argument
is
coming
that
he
cannot
thereafter
waive
those
rights.
this
is
a
point--there
is
no--in
this
record
before
this
court
this
morning,
evidence
of
any
kind
of
compulsion
or
coercion
in
any
real
sense
of
that
term,
unless
the
mere
fact
of
custody
itself
is
sufficient
coercion;
and
i
submit
that
it's
not.
on
this
question--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
mere
custody;
i
don't
believe
it
did,
mr.
justice--
mr.
dennis
j.
roberts,
ii
oh,
yes,
yes.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
be
understood
to
say
that
that
was
not
precluded
by
miranda.
what
i'm
saying
is,
that
where
there's
custody,
and
we
have
this
whole
idea
of
inherent
compulsion
which
precludes
waiver,
that's
a--that
that
was
never
precluded
by
miranda.
and
when
we
do
talk
about
the
scrupulous
observance
of
constitutional
rights
in
this
particular
case,
we
do
have
to
remember
that
the
man
was
taken
back
to
the
scene,
was
taken
out
of
the
car
in
which
he
was
sitting
with
the
three
officers,
was
spoken
to
again
by
captain
leyden,
and
told
captain
leyden,
"no,
i
want
to
take
you
to
the
gun
because
i
don't
want
the
children
to
be
hurt."
and
then
immediately
he
took
them
to
the
gun.
that's
the
second
waiver
away
from
whatever
offense
may
have
occurred.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
overlooked,
and
not
given
sufficient
attention
by
respondent.
two
transcript
references,
if
i
may,
and
it
please
the
court.
there
was
reference
made
in
my
brother's
argument
to
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
any
testimony
concerning
what
was
really
said
in
the
police
car.
in
fact,
the
opinion--i
should
say
the
appendix,
at
pages
43
through
45
contains
what
was
said
in
the
police
car.
granted,
it's
not
much,
but
that's
all
there
was.
once
the--that's
one
of
the
state's
positions,
that
if
this
little
bit
of
observation,
byplay,
in
the
front
seat
of
the
automobile
constitutes
impermissible
interrogation,
it's
taken
miranda
way
beyond
its
original
facts.
the
second
point
made
by
my
brother
is,
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
really
didn't
rely
on
the
brewer
case
in
its
decision.
at
page
6a
of
the
opinion
of
the
court,
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
basis
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court's
distinction
is
set
out.
and
i
submit
that
any
fair
and
reasonable
reading
of
that
basis
of
the
opinion
is
to
rest
that
court's
decision
on
this
court's
holding
in
brewer
v.
williams.
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
a
situation
where
the
respondent,
it
seems
to
me,
respectfully,
is
attempting
to
extend
the
prophylactic
safeguards
of
miranda
into
a
situation
where
it
violates
what
members
of
this
court
have
referred
to
over
the
years
as
the
strong
public
interest
in
convicting
the
guilty.
and
it's
respectfully
submitted
that
the
court
should
not
permit
that
result;
that
the
decision
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
