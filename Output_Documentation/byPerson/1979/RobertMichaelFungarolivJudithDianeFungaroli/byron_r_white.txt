normally
in
a
record
that's
sent
up
here
from
the
state
court,
it
might
not
even
contain
the
briefs.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
jurisdictional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
while
i've
got
you
interrupted.
your
client
was
also
held
in
contempt
for
violating
a
visitation
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
raised
some
objection
about
notice
in
connection
with
that,
but
i
take
it
that
that
issue
is
not
here
before
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
ok.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
in
the
first
paragraph
after
that
assignment
of
error,
the
brief
had
argued
and
the
reason
this
was
our
error
was
that
it
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
and
cited
federal
cases
for
it.
would
that
have
been
an
adequate
raising
of
it,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
later
in
the
brief,
the
federal
constitutional
rulings
by
this
court
were
cited
in
support
of
the
assignment
of
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
just
later,
a
few
paragraphs
down
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
that's
a
valid
observation
with
respect
to
whether
this
is
a
proper
appeal
or
not,
but
that
would
just
mean
it
might
be
a
certiorari
question
rather
than
an
appeal
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
how
about
a
claim
that
he
had
been
denied
due
process
in
these
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that's
true,
mr.
brown,
one
could
construe
the
statute
as
only
applying
in
cases
where
there's
no
counterclaim
where
the
plaintiff
goes
in,
and
the
defendant
is
not
yet
represented
by
counsel
and
that's
quite
a
different
problem.
you
ask
if
it's
too
much
for
the
jurisdictional
statement
to
identify
the
problem
better.
couldn't
one
also
ask
whether
it's
too
much
for
the
response
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
to
identify
the
jurisdictional
problem
if
it's
so
obvious?
you
can
see
the
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
have
been
right
that
you
could
have
moved
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
but
that
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
it
was
not
a
certiorari
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
had
raised
a
federal
constitutional
question
in
the
state
courts
properly
and
that
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings,
had
been
denied
federal
due
process
because
i
wasn't
given
notice
that
i
was
entitled
to.
now
you
can
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
or
may
not
involve
the
statute,
but
it
certainly
is
a
federal
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
really
is
complaining
though
that
he
was
denied
due
process
of
law
for
failure
to
be
given
notice.
for
failure
of
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
find
it
somewhat
ironic
that
you're
claiming
lack
of
notice
of
the
issue
in
the
case,
and
you
fail
to
give
counsel
notice
of
a
motion
in
a
trial
court
and
i
don't
understand
why
you
wouldn't
give
notice
regardless
of
what
the
statute
says.
if
your
opponent
is
represented
by
counsel
--
what
is
the
normal
practice
in
north
carolina?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
anything.
if
you're
going
to
contest
a
matter
of
any
kind
and
your
opponent's
represented
by
counsel,
why
in
the
world
wouldn't
you
give
your
opponent
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
here
explain
why
it
wasn't
done
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
the
statute's
there
or
not,
you
did
know
your
opponent
was
represented
by
counsel
and
didn't
serve
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wouldn't
happen
very
often
in
the
places
i
used
to
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
all
this
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
knew
that.
and
do
i
understand
the
--
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
asked
you
what
the
court
held.
as
far
as
i
can
see
what
the
court
held
was
if
you
find
abandonment,
and
he's
left
the
state,
no
notice
is
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
whether
they
know
where
he
is.
no
notice.
not
even
--
no
publication,
no
mail,
no
nothing.
even
if
you
know
exactly
where
he
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you
know
he's
represented
by
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
he's
not
required
to
give
notice.
and
i
take
it
you
could
enter
a
final
decree
of
divorce
without
notice
to
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
mentioned
earlier,
didn't
you,
that
this
particular
statute
was
not
in
your
mind
at
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
file,
as
i
understood
you
earlier,
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
your
motion
for
temporary
alimony
thinking
you
were
doing
it
pursuant
to
this
statute.
am
i
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
section
(e)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
specifically
this
subparagraph
(e)
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
trial
judge
make
an
express
finding
of
any
kind
that
he
was
acting
pursuant
to
subdivision
(e)
having
found
that
he'd
left
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
are
arguing
that
as
long
as
he's
abandoned
and
has
left
the
state,
that
that
automatically
terminates
any
obligation
which
respect
to
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
care
whether
you
rely
on
the
statute
or
what
you're
relying
on,
but
that's
what
you're
arguing.
and
that
that's
constitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i'm
asking
you.
i'm
asking
you
whether
or
not
you
are
saying
that
it's
quite
constitutional
to
dispense
with
notice
simply
on
the
grounds
of
abandonment
and
leaving
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
say
that.
don't
you?
