a
frivolous
issue,

justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
time

either
under
the
rules
of
the
court
or
the
statute
for
the
period
in
which
that
temporary
order
can
be
extant,
without
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
time
limit?
thirty
days?
sixty
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
many
courts,
for
example
on
temporary
restraining
orders
have
a
return
day
when
it
must
be
returned
or
the
court
imposes
a
return
day.

but,
we
often
have
hearings
without
any
notice
to
anyone.
and
a
restraining
order
can
be
obtained
under
limited
circumstances
by
walking
into
the

the

without
any
notice
to

divorce
case.
can
the
state
court
enter
a
temporary
order
for
temporary
alimony
and
custody
of
children
pending
a
return
date?
chief
justice
warren
e.

well,
now,
just
confine
ourselves
to
that
one
question,
if
you
will.
chief

yes,
but
is
that
the
common
practice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
temporary
alimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
you're
quite
different
from
almost
all
the
other
states
where
that
can
be
done
routinely
with
a
prompt
return
date.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
your
response
to
mr.
justice
powell.
was
there
anything
to
prevent
your
client
from
moving
the
court
as
soon
as
he
became
aware
of
the
entry
of
this
order
and
asking
for
a
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
can
he
move
in
the
court
to
get
a
hearing
on
the
issues?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whatever
you
call
it,
can
he
get
into
the
court
to
have
these
issues
examined?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
it
part
of
the
status
quo
the
normal
support
which
a
husband
is
lawfully
required
to
give
to
his
wife?
and
temporary
alimony
maintains
the
status
quo
in
some
form.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
me
why
it
is
not
an
analogous
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

have
only
about
three
minutes
left
so
you'd
better
bear
that
in

e.
burger
you
may
lodge
them
with
the
clerk.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you'd
better
confine
yourself
to
what's
in
the
record,
counsel,
unless
we
specifically
ask
for
you
to
go
outside.
chief
justice
warren
e.

we
are
confining

i
take
it,
to
the
temporary
alimony.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
to
the
granting
of
the
divorce.
chief
