justice
thurgood

that
isn't
the
question--wasn't
the
question
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
you
raised,
"did
the
court
err
in
conducting
an
alimony
pendente
lite
hearing
as
the
plaintiff
appellant
did
not
have
notice
of
said
hearings?"
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
anything
else
presented
to
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
is
that
that
says
it
is
a
federal
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
asking
for
it
where?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
it
with
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
we
know
--
how
can
you
tell
me
what
you
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
me
to
go
and
look
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
ok.
i'll
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
morrow,
i
have
in
my
hand
a
document,
plaintiff
appellant's
brief
signed
by
john
f.
morrow.
that's
your
brief,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
read
you
the
question
presented.
did
the
court
err
in
conducting
an
alimony
pendente
lite
hearing
as
the
plaintiff
appellant
did
not
have
notice
of
said
hearing?
question
mark.
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
brief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
didn't
raise
it,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
find
two
cases,
federal
cases.
i
don't
find
the
statute
in
the
brief
at
all.
i
don't
find
a
single
word
which
says
that
you
attacked
the
statute.
the
only
thing
you've
got
is
on
page
4.
you
cite
the
statute.
and
then
you
leave
it
right
there.
and
the
case
that
you
cite
is
truax
against
corrigan.
and
that
bears
on
this?
and
why
do
you
say
that
this
statute,
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
violates
the
united
states
--
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
last
did
you
see
this
brief?
you
knew
you
were
going
to
argue
this
case,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
didn't
you
know
this
point
would
come
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
raised
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
and
i
didn't
need
any
rule
to
raise
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
need
any
rule
to
raise
a
jurisdictional
point.
do
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn't
you
raise
this
question
about
his
not
raised
this
point
in
north
carolina
in
response
to
his
jurisdictional
statement?
i
have
here
a
motion
to
dismiss.
you
never
mentioned
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
it
was
important?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
argued
in
here
that
it
was
constitutional.
you
argued
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
admit
it
on
the
merits.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
you
say
we
shouldn't
meet
the
merits.
