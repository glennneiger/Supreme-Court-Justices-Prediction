mr.
morrow,
may
i
ask
you,
your
opponents
claim
that
you
did
not
raise
that
as
a
federal
constitutional
fourteenth
amendment
claim
in
the
north
carolina
courts
and
my
own
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
north
carolina
indicates
that
they
say
you
said
it
was
invalid,
as
not
giving
notice
of
the
hearing
they
don't
mention
any
federal
case
or
federal
constitutional
provisions.
did
you
before
them
or
before
the
trial
court
put
an
issue
on
federal
constitutional
grounds
of
this
provision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ok,
how
about
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
our
purpose,
we
really
needed
to
know,
i
suppose,
the
contents
of
your
brief
before
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
is
that
in
the
record
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
simply
contains
your
naked
assertion,
your
jurisdictional
statement.
doesn't
it?
i
mean
it
--
or
does
it
contain
--
i
didn't
find
in
it
a
quote
from
your
brief
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
brief
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
both
of
those
are
here
in
the
record
somewhere
else.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it
be
accompanied
by
a
restraining
order
forbidding

ex
parte.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
irreparable
damage
tie
in
with
notice
and
hearing
in
the
due
process?
i
had
always
thought
of
irreparable
damage
as
being
an
element
that
you
have
to
show
in
order
to
obtain
a
permanent
injunction
or
perhaps
a
temporary
injunction,
and
that
due
process
notice
and
hearing
requirements
were
not
necessarily
tied
into
irreparable
damage.

typical
service
by
mail
statute
or
substitute
service
statute
frequently
requires
30
days
return
date,
20
days
return
date.
now,
if
your
opposing
counsels
move
that
this
man
had
removed
himself
to
fairfax
county,
virginia,
and
went
about
serving
him
under
the
notice
that
permanent
alimony
order
would
be
requested
on
such-and-such
a
date,
would
you
say
that
a
court
could
not
in
the
interim
even
before
he
received
the
notice
in
fairfax
county,
virginia,
order
temporary
alimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
a
man
can
simply
move
away
3,000
miles
and
until
you
can
somehow
get
personal
jurisdiction
over
him,
he's
home
free
so
far
as
his
duty
to
support
is
concerned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
you
on
notice
in
effect
once
you
file
a
law
suit
of
proceedings
that
take
place
in
that
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
still
said
he'd
been
denied
due
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
there's
an
order
in
the
appendix,
at
page
35,
by
judge
freeman,
who
i
take
it
is
the
presiding
judge
of
the
superior
court,
authorizing
the
appellant's
counsel
of
record
to
withdraw.
is
that
something
in
connection
with
the
contempt
order?
