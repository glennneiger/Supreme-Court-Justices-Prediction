justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
morrow,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
this
is
an
unusual
situation
because
we've
got
a
counterclaim
in
effect.
if
you
had
a
case
in
which
the
moving
party
was
also
the
plaintiff
and
say
the
wife
is
the
plaintiff,
and
the
husband
had
left
the
state
and
was
not
represented
by
counsel,
and
you
had
any
of
the
other
conditions
set
forth
in
subparagraph
(e),
would
you
contest
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
those
circumstances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
the
fact
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
would
you
deal
with
--
if
you
say
the
filing
of
a
brand
new
law
suit,
and
the
husband
is
departed
for
parts
unknown
or
is
about
to
remove
property,
what
would
you
say
the
statute
should
require
to
satisfy
due
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
ample
notice
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
if
he's
standing
in
the
courthouse
because
if
he
shall
have
abandoned
the
dependent
spouse
and
left
the
state
by
hypothesis,
he's
not
standing
in
the
courthouse.
or
shall
be
in
parts
unknown.
by
hypothesis
there
he's
not
standing
in
the
courthouse.
in
the
third
situation,
he's
about
to
remove
all
his
property
and
leave
the
state,
but
you
might
give
him
notice
and
be
sure
he
can
get
away
before
the
papers
are
served.
that's
the
problem
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
have
personal
jurisdiction
over
him
because
he
came
in
here
as
a
plaintiff
and
submitted
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
come
in
as
a
party
to
the
court
and
submit
yourself
to
its
jurisdiction,
then
there's
no
question
of
the
personal
jurisdiction
of
the
court
over
you.
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
alimony
order
still
in
existence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
force?
is
it
a
permanent
order
or
is
it
still
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
still
a
temporary
order,
but
you
say
it
lasts
a
long
time
in
any
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
the
decision
below
correctly,
is
it
--
was
it
held
that
as
long
as
it's
alleged
in
the
alimony
request
that
the
person
has
abandoned
and
that
he
has
left
the
state
and
the
court
finds
that
he
has
abandoned
and
left
the
state,
that
you
never
need
to
give
him
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
it
excuse
notice
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
find
that
he
had
abandoned.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
had
left
the
state.
so
i
will
ask
you
again.
as
long
as
you
make
those
two
findings,
no
notice
is
ever
necessary.
