mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
happened
to
bring
with
me
today
9
copies
of
the
relevant
section
of
mr.
morrow's
brief,
as
well
as
9
copies
of
his
direct
appeal
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
if
the
court
didn't
have
those
available,
i'll
be
glad
to
pass
them
up.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
several
questions
are
presented
here
today,
of
course,
for
the
court's
consideration
and
the
primary
one
i
am
concerned
with,
of
course,
is
the
one
that's
already
been
raised
and
that's
whether
the
appellant
has
met
his
burden
under
street
v
new
york
and
other
established
decisions
of
this
court
to
raise
the
issue
timely
and
in
a
timely
fashion,
and
a
clear
fashion
in
the
courts
below
to
give
those
courts,
to
give
opposing
counsel
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those
questions.
appellee
submits
that
that
question
has
never
been
properly
presented
that
the
burden
hasn't
been
met
here
today
that
indeed,
it
cannot
be
met.
rule
10(c)
of
the
north
carolina
rules
of
appellate
procedure
provides
that
each
assignment
of
error
shall,
so
far
as
practicable,
be
confined
to
a
single
issue
of
law
and
shall
state
plainly
and
concisely
and
without
argumentation
the
basis
upon
which
error
is
assigned
and
the
exceptions
not
thus
listed
will
be
deemed
abandoned.
now,
in
the
grouping
of
exceptions
and
assignments
of
error,
the
appellant
simply
stated
that
the
trial
court
committed
prejudicial
error
in
conducting
a
hearing
upon
the
defendant's
motion
for
temporary
alimony
in
that
the
defendant
had
not
properly
served
the
answer
and
counterclaim
upon
the
plaintiff
and
in
that
the
plaintiff
was
not
given
notice
of
this
hearing.
that
assignment
of
error
so
worded,
appellee
would
contend
to
the
court,
was
abandoned
or
did
not
raise
the
constitutional
issue
of
this
statute.
and
at
that
point,
the
issue
was
abandoned.
furthermore,
rule
28(a)
of
the
north
carolina
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
dealing
with
the
function
and
content
of
briefs,
states
that
the
function
of
all
briefs
required
and
permitted
to
be
filed
is
to
define
clearly
the
questions
presented
to
the
reviewing
court
and
to
present
the
arguments
and
authorities
upon
which
the
parties
rely
in
support
of
their
respective
position
thereon.
review
is
limited
to
questions
so
presented
in
the
several
briefs.
now
as
mr.
justice
marshall
has
pointed
out,
the
brief
in
this
case
simply
said
did
the
court
err
in
conducting
an
alimony
pendente
lite
hearing
as
the
plaintiff
appellant
had
no
notice
of
said
hearing.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
think
it
would
be
gray
and
the
reason
i
say
that,
this
statute
--
i
think
--
it
would
certainly
be
better.
i'd
be
more
on
notice
that
something
was
coming
up.
and
this
case
really
didn't
get
to
be
a
federal
question,
it
seems
to
me,
until
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
--
in
the
brief.
in
fact
though
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
he
didn't
even
say
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
this
statute's
unconstitutional.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
page
15
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
appellant
says
the
paramount
point
sub
judice
is
that
this
husband
had
an
attorney
who
if
had
been
given
notice
could
have
gone
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
justice
white,
what
i
think
the
question
i
asked
in
response
very
simply
is,
is
it
too
much
to
ask
for
someone
who's
going
to
take
a
case
up
on
appeal
and
ultimately,
supposedly
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
to
say
at
some
initial
point
in
the
appellate
process
this
statute's
unconstitutional.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
think
that
really
goes
--
that
would
be
sort
of
an
as-applied
argument
and
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
this
statute
--
in
other
words,
this
statute
mandates
a
certain
procedure.
this
statute,
if
you
will,
in
effect
says
under
certain
limited
situations,
you
don't
have
to
give
notice.
so
i
can't
see
how
you
could
argue
that
anything's
unconstitutional
unless
the
statute's
unconstitutional.
in
other
words,
if
you
say
i've
been
denied
due
process
simply
because
i
don't
have
notice
unless
the
statute's
unconstitutional,
that
argument
seems
to
me
to
be
irrelevant.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
can
only
make
a
heart-felt
apology
about
that,
and
i
have
what
i
think
is
some
justification
and
that
is,
it
wasn't
until
the
brief
was
filed
that
the
statute
was
laid
on
the
line.
in
other
words,
at
the
point
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed,
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
the
appellant
was
saying
was
i've
been
denied
due
process
because
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
think
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
well,
i
know
that
in
that
whole
line
of
cases
there,
i
cite
the
charleston
federal
savings
and
loan
case
versus
alderson.
that
talks
about
a
timely,
insistent
planned
raising
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied.
that
seems
like
to
me
not
to
be
a
lot
to
ask
of
someone
to
do
that,
so
that
you're
on
notice
exactly
what
it
is
we're
dealing
with
here.
and
i
quite
frankly
didn't
know
--
i
had
some
suspicion
because
my
own
belief
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
that's
right.
but
the
statute
seems
to
answer
that.
in
other
words,
the
statute
says
it's
permissible.
unless
the
statute's
unconstitutional,
i
can't
see
that
he's
been
denied
due
process.
and
i
think
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
as
to
notice
for
temporary
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
well,
you're
on
your
word,
your
honor.
and
in
this
case
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
it
explains
it
as
best
i
think
--
my
brief
explains
it
as
best
as
it
can
be
explained.
and
i
think
that
is
--
i
didn't
even
know
of
the
existence
of
this
statute
until
i
was
into
this
case.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
well,
what
i
also
knew
was
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
mr.
justice,
what
i
did
know
was
this.
i
knew
that
he'd
gone
to
virginia.
i
knew
that
by
his
own
pleading
that
he
served
on
my
client
in
north
carolina,
and
i
also
knew,
because
his
business
partner
called
me
up
on
the
phone
and
said
he's
attempting
to
transfer
his
business
interests,
which
is
the
only
asset
he
has
in
north
carolina.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
no,
sir.
it's
not.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
concede
that.
i
concede
that,
and
all
i
can
say
is
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
if
i
--
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
didn't
know
--
what
i'm
saying
is
--
the
reason
i
didn't
raise
that
response
to
his
jurisdictional
statement.
i
mean
my
argument
is
he's
never
raised
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
its
face.
i
didn't
know
until
he
filed
his
brief
that
he
was
raising
that.
in
other
words,
it's
only
in
the
brief
for
the
first
time
that
he
comes
out
clearly
and
unequivocally
and
says,
in
the
first
heading
under
the
argument
section
this
statute's
unconstitutional.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
don't
think
you
should,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
--
because
not
until
he
filed
his
brief
did
we
know
that
that
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face
was
being
tested.
and
certainly,
he
had
a
duty,
i
think,
to
adequately
inform
not
only
me,
but
the
appellate
courts
of
north
carolina
--
that's
--
you're
looking
at
the
decision.
you're
looking
at
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
it's
understandable
why
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
or
the
constitutionality
of
anything
isn't
discussed.
it's
not
mentioned
there
at
all.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
did
the
court
of
appeals
discuss
that?
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
because
it
said
in
this
case,
the
statute
provides,
what
it
provides
and
the
facts
in
the
record
were
sufficient
for
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
finding
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
and
had
left
the
state.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
that's
correct.
although
i
read
the
statute
--
the
statute
says
notice
is
unnecessary.
i
don't
necessarily
contend
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
well,
i
knew
that.
but
there
is
a
section
in
the
statute,
in
the
opinion
where
the
court
of
appeals
says
this
appellant
brought
on
this
situation
by
his
own
actions.
and
i
don't
believe
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
i
don't
read
the
statute
to
mean
that
even
if
he'd
left
the
state,
and
even
if
he'd
abandoned
his
wife
that
the
trial
judge
is
bound
to
give
no
notice.
i
think
it's
in
the
trial
judge's
discretion.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
you
certainly
couldn't
under
this
statute
because
this
statute's
narrowly
drawn
and
is
just
applied
to
temporary
alimony
situation.
and
that,
i
think,
in
light
of
some
of
the
questions
asked
of
mr.
morrow
might
bear
some
clarification.
temporary
alimony,
however
entered,
is
good
only
during
the
pendency
of
the
case
in
chief.
that
is,
once
you
have
a
hearing,
a
trial
on
the
case
in
chief
on
alimony,
then
all
sorts
of
things
can
happen.
i
mean,
if
you
--
if
the
wife
had
been
given
alimony,
and
you're
the
husband,
and
you
go
to
trial,
and
you
win,
alimony
ceases
at
that
point.
if
you
go
to
trial
and
you
lose,
the
court
could
order
you
to
pay
an
amount
less
than
what
you've
been
paying
under
the
temporary
alimony
order.
so
that
the
temporary
alimony
is
certainly
a
--
the
ultimate
judicial
determination
is
made
by
trial
on
the
merits
involving
the
alimony
question.
and
i
might
also
point
out
that
in
some
ways,
a
supporting
spouse
who
has
been
ordered
to
pay
alimony,
either
with
or
without
notice,
is
to
some
extent
better
off
in
terms
of
remedies
available
to
him
than,
for
example,
miss
fuentes
was
in
fuentes
versus
shevin.
all
he's
got
to
do,
if
he
is
ordered
with
or
without
notice
to
pay
temporary
alimony,
is
take
final
notice
of
appeal
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals,
post
a
$200
appeal
bond
and
during
the
pendency
of
that
appeal,
the
trial
court
is
entirely
functus
officio
as
to
any
enforcement
capabilities.
that
is,
he
can
go
without
paying
anything
he's
been
ordered
to
pay.
now,
the
risk
he
runs,
if
he
does
that,
if
he
loses
on
appeal
then
the
trial
court
could,
if
it
so
chose,
hold
him
in
contempt
for
not
having
made
the
payments
during
the
course
of
the
appeal.
if
he
wins
the
appeal,
of
course,
he's
lost
nothing.
so
there's
a
good
deal
of
protection.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i've
got
an
answer
for
that,
but
i'm
told
it's
outside
the
record,
and
i
can't
tell
you.
i
had
some
knowledge
that
was
available
to
me
at
that
time,
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
it
was
not
in
my
mind
until
--
we
had
a
series
of
events
that
sort
of
coalesced
here
at
one
time.
i
mean
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
no.
when
i
did
get
to
file
my
motion
for
temporary
alimony,
by
that
time,
i
was
cognizant
of
the
existence
of
this
statute
and
when
i
presented
the
motion
to
the
trial
judge,
i
of
course
brought
to
his
attention
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
and
the
documents
we
submitted
along
with
the
motion
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
that's
correct.
you
will
note
in
the
order,
the
order
itself
awarding
the
temporary
alimony,
he
makes
a
finding
of
fact
there
in
the
first
paragraph
of
that
order,
that
no
notice
was
given
and
none
is
required
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
50-16.8(e).
so
the
trial
judge
knew
that.
he
also
knew
by
documents
submitted
to
him
at
the
time
the
motion
was
made
that
mr.
fungaroli
left
the
state
because
we
submitted
the
pleadings,
verified
pleadings
he
filed
in
virginia.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
the
trial
judge,
mr.
justice,
sir,
went
and
made
an
express
finding
--
the
only
express
finding
if
i
understand
your
question
as
to
the
statute
was
because
he
left
the
state.
he
had
abandoned
his
wife.
no
notice
was
required
under
this
statute,
and
he
mentioned
the
statute
expressly.
now,
that
motion
is
supported
by
the
record
of
course
in
the
trial
court
and
the
record
in
this
court.
that
in
fact
he
was
gone,
and
the
appellant
makes
no
assertion
here
today,
nor
has
he
ever
made
an
assertion
other
than
the
fact
that
he
hadn't
abandoned
his
wife.
he's
never
claimed
that
he
didn't
leave
the
state.
he's
never
claimed
that
he
provided
any
support
to
her
since
december
21st
when
he
took
out
the
complaint
and
had
her
involuntarily
committed
to
a
mental
hospital.
he's
never
claimed
that
he
was
incapable
of
making
any
support
payments
that
were
ordered.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
the
very
wording
of
the
statute
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
think
--
i've
got
to
make
a
distinction
between
as-applied
and
on
its
face.
if
you're
asking
me
if
this
ever
came
up
again,
would
i
give
notice,
and
i
would
say
--
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
think
so.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
i
do
have
to
say
that.
and
i
say
it
because
of
the
cases
of
this
court
whether
it's
fuentes
or
mitchell
or
whatever
it
is.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
that's
correct.
we're
not
talking
about
anything
else.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
right.
nothing
but
the
temporary
alimony.
and
whether
you
look
at
fuentes
or
mitchell
or
di-chem,
what
you
find
in
every
single
one
of
those
cases
whether
it
requires
prior
notice
or
it
doesn't,
is
some
discussion
about
the
legitimate
protection
of
the
creditor
interest.
that
seems
to
me
what
the
legislature
was
trying
to
do
here.
the
legislature
said
--
and
they've
done
it
not
only
in
this
statute,
they've
done
it
in
other
statutes
we
cited
there
in
the
brief.
they've
given
the
dependent
spouse
creditor
status
for
purposes
of
collection
and
enforcement
of
temporary
alimony.
and
what
they
were
doing
here,
whether
it
was
wise
or
unwise,
was
attempting
to
provide
some
sort
of
protection
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
very
wording
of
the
statute
makes
it
clear
that
that's
what
they
were
concerned
with.
it
was
a
--
in
the
words
of
mitchell
--
debtor
acting
in
bad
faith.
whether
he
was
secretly
destroying
and
concealing
has
assets
or
whether
he
was
fleeing
to
virginia
and
leaving
his
wife
with
no
means
of
support.
whichever
one
of
those
things
he
was
doing
--
what
the
legislature
in
its
wisdom
or
not
in
its
wisdom
thought
it
was
doing,
was
trying
to
provide
some
means
of
protection
for
a
dependent
spouse
who
was
dealing
with
a
supporting
spouse
who
was
acting
in
bad
faith.
i
submit
to
you
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
record
in
this
case
--
i
can't
conceive
of
an
individual
ever
having
acted
in
more
bad
faith
throughout
the
entire
course
litigation
than
the
appellant
has
in
this
case.
he's
simply
thumbed
his
nose
at
the
courts
and
disregarded
court
orders,
and
simply
in
effect
said
i'll
do
what
i
want
to
do.
i
think
not
even
a
close
reading
--
just
a
cursory
reading
of
the
record,
in
my
opinion,
leads
one
or
should
lead
one
to
that
implication.
mr.
b.
ervin
brown,
ii
yes,
that
was
in
connection
with
the
contempt
order.
not
--
it
was
a
contempt
order
that
had
nothing
to
do
per
se
with
this
alimony.
it
had
to
do
--
it
was
a
motion
for
contempt
for
his
failure
to
provide
his
wife
visitation
with
the
child.
right
about
the
point
that
motion
was
coming
up,
the
appellant
fired
his
attorney
who's
mentioned
in
this
order,
a
mr.
parker,
who
had
been
his
attorney
--
i
personally
know
him
--
had
been
mr.
fungaroli's
attorney
all
along.
he
fared
that
attorney
and,
at
that
point,
hired,
retained
mr.
morrow,
or
had
his
father
retain
mr.
morrow.
he
was
in
town,
the
father
was
in
town,
but
the
appellant
was
not.
he
sent
his
father
down
to
the
show-cause
hearing
retained
mr.
morrow,
and
the
court
granted
mr.
parker's
motion
to
withdraw,
and
mr.
morrow
then
became
the
appellant's
retained
counsel
at
that
point.
i
think
just
to
reiterate
quickly
on
mr.
justice
marshall's
observation,
there's
not
a
single
reference
in
the
brief
here
on
the
jurisdictional
question,
not
a
single
reference
to
a
federal
case.
i
in
fact
made
a
mistake
in
my
brief
in
saying
that
morrow
cited
mullane
v.
central
hanover
bank
and
trust
company.
he
in
fact
didn't.
what's
cited
is
the
1951
state
court
case
of
mclean
versus
mclean,
and
there's
a
lengthy
quote
from
that
case
in
the
brief,
and
the
last
portion
of
that
quote
happens
to
be
a
quote
within
a
quote
citing
mullane.
so
at
the
point
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
as
i
said
before,
up
really
until
mr.
morrow
filed
his
brief
with
this
court,
what
we
were
dealing
with
there
was
three
--
he
cited
three
north
carolina
domestic
cases
and
the
citations
of
strong's
index.
now,
literally,
i
feel
like
this
case
contained
a
federal
question
once
it
was
filed
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.
in
summary,
i
think,
it's
our
contention
that
(1)
of
course
that
the
issue
has
not
been
properly
presented
and
for
that
reason,
should
be
dismissed.
and
that
(2),
if
the
court
feels
otherwise
about
that,
then
the
state
has
reached
a
perhaps
not
perfect,
but
a
fair
constitutional
accommodation
of
the
competing
interests
of
dependent
and
supporting
spouses
as
well
as
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
and
that
the
statute
for
that
reason
should
be
sustained.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
really
won't
take
up
any
more
of
the
court's
time.
