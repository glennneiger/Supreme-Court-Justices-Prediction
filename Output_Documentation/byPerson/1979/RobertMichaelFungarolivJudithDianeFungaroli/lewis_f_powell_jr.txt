justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
have
--
is
the
plaintiff
appellant's
brief
--
is
that
the
brief
that
was
filed
in
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
i
just
got
the
record.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
you
can
go
ahead.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
went
into
the
court
and
moved
for
hearing
following
the
entry
of
the
order,
would
the
court
grant
you
a
hearing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
if
he
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
circumstances
have
changed
under
the
statutory
language,
doesn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
brown,
perhaps
you've
already
answered
this
when
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
you
the
question.
you
knew
he
was
represented
by
counsel
didn't
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you
knew
who
the
counsel
was?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
personally?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
puzzled,
too.
before
you
went
in
to
apply
for
the
order
on
temporary
alimony,
why
didn't
you
call
up
the
lawyer
and
just
tell
him
you
were
going
to
do
it?
