mr.
john
f.
morrow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
this
morning
arguing
a
case
to
the
effect
that
a
north
carolina
alimony-type
statute,
specifically
stating
in
the
statute
that
notice
to
the
defendant
is
not
required
of
temporary
alimony
hearings,
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
now
of
course,
we
were
not
before
the
trial
court
because
there
was
no
notice
of
the
hearing.
i
was
not
the
counsel
at
that
time
by
the
way.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
but
yes,
we
did
raise
it
on
appeal,
i
think
that
our
assignments
of
errors
and
our
brief
before
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
will
clearly
show
you
that.
the
court
of
appeals,
i
simply
contend
to
you
ignored
the
issue,
as
did
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
when
they
ruled
it
to
be
a
frivolous
appeal.
in
north
carolina,
of
course,
if
you
have
a
constitutional
issue,
you
supposedly
have
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
to
our
supreme
court.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
the
way
i
understand
the
ruling
is
that
it
was
a
frivolous
issue.
the
question
was
there.
but
as
they
looked
at
the
case,
the
question
really
wasn't
there.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
for
a
period
of
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
as
to
how
long
the
order
is
good?
mr.
john
f.
morrow
absolutely
not.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
we
try
to
discuss
that
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
order
is
entered
and
then
at
that
time,
whenever
the
defendant
is
notified,
it's
up
to
him
as
to
whether
or
not
to
go
to
court
and
with
the
burden
of
proof
to
try
to
set
that
order
aside
that
is,
the
order
issued
under
the
statute
which
we
are
attacking.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes,
it
would
be
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
is
not
in
our
appendix,
but
it
is
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
i
believe.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
that
is
the
way
the
question
was
presented
in
the
brief.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
well,
the
assignment,
the
specific
assignment
of
error.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
it's
in
the
specific
assignment
of
error.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
that
would
also
be
what
would
be
in
the
brief
as
well
as
in
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes,
and
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
it
is
clearly
my
understanding
that
they
were
forwarded
to
the
court.
i
have
not
personally
gone
to
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
well,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
no,
sir.
i
will
certainly
furnish
it
to
the
court.
i'm
sorry
i
do
not
have
it
with
me.
when
we
appealed
unto
this
court,
initially
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
was
thinking
that
they
were
to
forward
the
record,
as
the
court
of
last
resort.
then
they
called
me
up,
and
said
that
we
are
not
forwarding
that
record
because
we
did
not
rule
on
it.
the
court
of
appeals
will
be
forwarding
the
record
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
and
actually,
the
record
that
you
have
in
file
was
forwarded
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
north
carolina.
now,
i
would
further
point
out
to
the
court
with
reference
to
questions
as
whether
or
not
the
appeal
has
been
properly
raised
and
has
been
properly
brought
before
this
court
that
as
i
understand
it,
under
your
supreme
court
rules,
rule
16(b)
is
where
the
motion
to
dismiss
should
have
been
raised
by
the
appellee
in
this
case
and
heard
on
motion
prior
to
raising
that
issue
in
the
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes,
it
would
be
a
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
that
is
it
right
there.
now
the
front
of
it
will
tell
you
whether
it
is
the
brief
i
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
to
specifically
go
into
the
statute,
i
think
that
it
is
of
course
a
short
statute
and
one
that
i
can
read
to
you
in
a
short
amount
of
time.
as
i
read
the
statute,
i
would
ask
you
yourself
to
say,
does
this
sound
fair?
does
this
sound
like
the
way
that
we
have
trials
in
the
united
states?
now
specifically,
subsection
(e)
states.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
--
or
hearings.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
under
very
limited
circumstances.
normally
upon
allegations
of
irreparable
damage.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
we
cite
to
you
in
our
brief.
we
try
to
go
over
the
statutes
of
all
of
the
states.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
in
north
carolina,
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
the
common
practice
in
north
carolina?
mr.
john
f.
morrow
no.
the
common
practice
in
north
carolina
is
to
normally
serve
everybody
involved,
and
you
go
to
court
and
you
have
a
hearing.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes,
for
temporary
alimony.
and
custody.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i,
of
course,
do
not
practice
in
the
other
states.
i
would
wonder
if
we're
that
different
from
the
other
states,
as
i
review
the
statutes
of
the
other
states,
beginning
on
page
33
of
my
brief.
now,
the
way
a
case
normally
comes
on
in
north
carolina,
whether
it's
the
alimony
complaint
or
the
alimony
counterclaim,
a
notice
of
hearing
of
the
temporary
hearing
is
served
and
a
hearing
date
is
set.
in
our
city
of
winston-salem,
a
city
of
approximately
170,000
people,
there
will
be
approximately
20
hearings
a
week,
exactly
of
this
nature.
we
have
a
special
so-to-speak
court
--
heard
in
our
district
courts,
but
we
have
a
judge
assigned
to
hear
these
cases
3
days
a
week,
and
that's
all
that
that
district
court
judge
does.
it
is
the
extremely
rare
case,
i
would
say
to
you
--
or
circumstances
i
would
say
to
you
where
that
statute
is
used.
i
might
say
to
you
i've
been
practicing
15
years,
and
i've
never
seen
the
statute
used
before
it
was
used
in
this
case.
now,
a
temporary
alimony
order
in
north
carolina
is
a
very
significant
part
of
the
alimony
case.
in
our
district,
and
there
are
approximately
40
districts
in
north
carolina
covering
the
100
counties
that
we
have.
our
district
only
covers
one
county
because
we
are
one
of
the
larger
counties.
but
in
our
district,
it
is
normally
12
months
or
longer
before
you
can
receive
your
jury
trial
and
therefore,
whatever
is
ordered,
whether
it
is
$5.00
a
week
or
$5,000
a
week
or
nothing,
at
the
temporary
alimony
hearing,
it
has
a
rather
long-lasting
effect
on
the
amount
of
moneys
that
are
paid
on
settlement
negotiations
and
so
on
over
the
next
12
months
or
what
have
you
until
the
trial
is
reached.
it
is
not
an
order
that
normally
lasts
a
week
or
ten
days
or
what
have
you.
in
fact,
it
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
we
try
again
to
discuss
that
in
our
brief.
now,
there
is
a
part
of
the
statute,
north
carolina
general
statute
50-16.9,
that
states
"upon
a
showing
of
substantial
change
in
material
circumstances,
a
party
may
move
the
court
to
modify
or
vacate
an
order."
now,
what
that,
number
one,
would
do
in
this
case,
assuming
that
the
defendant
desired
to
try
to
take
advantage
of
50-16.9,
he
would
have
to
be
the
moving
party
that
has
filed
his
motion
in
court,
so
notified
the
other
side,
and
go
to
court.
he,
and
most
importantly,
i
say
to
you
--
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
change
in
material
circumstances
since
the
date
of
the
hearing,
the
date
that
the
order
was
entered
for
him
to
pay
alimony
without
notice.
now,
we
strongly
contend
to
you
that
under
the
law
and
rationale
of
numerous
cases
cited,
beginning
on
page
43
and
44
of
our
brief,
that
the
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
would
not
allow
what
i
call
bootstrapping
or
stating
that
there
is
inability
of
the
person
who
has
been
deprived
of
due
process
to
come
back
to
court
and
rectify
through
his
own
proof
the
situation.
the
case
of
armstrong
v
manso,
i
believe,
is
the
leading
case
in
that
area.
that
is
an
adoption
case
where
the
father
was
not
notified.
he
did
have
a
right
to
come
into
court
under
statutes
claiming
that
the
adoption
shouldn't
have
gone
through
once
he
found
out
about
it.
but
he
had
the
burden
of
proof.
now,
our
alimony
statutes
are
exactly
like
that
in
north
carolina.
at
the
initial
hearing,
the
wife
has
the
burden
of
proving
basically
two
things
one
is
fault.
we
are
a
fault
state.
there
are
10
grounds
for
alimony
for
everything
from
adultery
to
excessive
use
of
alcohol
to
abandonment,
indignities,
what
have
you.
she
has
to
prove,
number
one,
fault
and
number
two,
need.
and
then
the
judge
goes
into
not
only
her
needs,
but
of
course,
the
abilities
of
the
husband
to
provide.
those
are
all
things
that
are
supposed
to
be
heard.
the
wife,
well,
defendant
spouse,
as
as
our
statute
reads
but
usually
the
wife
has
the
burden
of
proving
all
of
those
things.
fault,
need,
and
ability.
she
has
to
prove
the
husband's
ability.
he
can
come
to
that
hearing
with
affirmative
defenses
such
as
her
own
adultery.
or
that
she
is
not
a
dependent
spouse
in
fact,
she's
a
multimillionaire
or
what
have
you.
now,
these
are
all
things
that
are
heard
at
that
hearing,
and
those
are
who
the
burden
of
proof
is
on.
the
wife
having
the
burden
of
proof
of
fault,
her
need
and
ability
and
the
husband
having
the
burden
of
proof
on
his
affirmative
defenses
at
that
hearing.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
well,
the
only
way
i
know
he
can
do
it
would
be
under
50-16.9.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
well,
that
is
actually
a
move
to
modify
based
upon
a
substantial
change
in
circumstances.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
he
can
get
into
the
court,
and
he
has
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
and
the
circumstances
have
changed.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
a
suit
for
straight
custody
of
the
child.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
no
body
has
ever
questioned
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
that
is
not
the
question
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
well,
burden
of
proof
ancillary
to
the
notice.
it
is
a
very
basic
due
process
problem.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
no.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
well,
i
don't
think
it's
different
when
you
get
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
that's
correct.
yes.
but
when
you
get
to
the
remedy,
i
think
the
remedy
is
very,
very
similar
that
is,
that
he
would
have
to
initiate
the
action
to
correct,
and
he
would
have
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
right.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
right.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
now
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i
certainly
would.
now,
in
this
case,
we
contest
it
as
applied
in
the
case
as
well
as
on
its
face.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes.
he
was
of
course.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
the
statute
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i'm
not
saying
that
this
type
of
statute
could
not
be
constitutional.
what
i'm
saying
the
statute
as
drawn
it
could
not
be
more
broad
i
contend
to
you.
it's
clearly
unconstitutional.
now,
there're
basically
three
things
in
the
statute,
and
they're
not
in
the
conjunctive.
you
show
anyone
of
these
three,
and
supposedly
you
can
just
forget
serving
that
husband
even
if
he's
standing
right
there
in
the
courthouse.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
you
can
give
proper
notice
in
that
situation.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
restraining
order
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes.
i
think
ex
parte.
under
that
third
section,
you
may
be
properly
alleging
some
type
of
irreparable
damage
where
due
process
may
not
be
violated
under
the
law
as
i
understand
it
and
contend
it
to
this
court.
and
i
don't
quite
frankly
concede
that
as
i
read
the
due
process
cases
on
those.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
like
i
said,
i
don't
concede
that
even
if
they
allowed
or
alleged
some
type
of
irreparable
damage
if
they
could
not
get
away
with
--
you
know
--
without
giving
notice.
i
don't
concede
that.
in
most
of
your
tr
--
temporary
restraining
orders,
cases,
what
the
plaintiff
is
trying
to
do
when
he
is
trying
to
get
his
restraining
order
is
maintain
some
type
of
status
quo.
in
this
case,
in
your
alimony
cases,
you're
going
to
court
for
affirmative
action
to
take
money
out
of
that
man's
pocket.
give
it
to
me.
let
me
do
whatever
i
want
to
with
it.
then
he
may
come
to
court
some
later
day.
how
does
he
get
his
money
back?
in
other
words,
we're
dealing
with
something
much
more,
i
contend
to
this
honorable
court,
than
somebody
trying
to
maintain
a
status
quo
without
actual
notice
to
the
other
person.
now,
our
statute
says
that
if
one
of
these
three
things
exists,
then
you
go
to
court,
and
you
get
your
order,
and
that's
all
the
statute
says.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
well,
then,
if
that
were
a
proper
hypothetical
then
every
case,
why
give
the
man
notice?
just
let
the
one
side
go
to
court
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
in
the
due
process
of
all
cases
dealing
with
notice,
the
right
to
be
heard,
the
right
to
know
that
the
case
is
pending
and
go
into
court
and
defend
yourself.
in
those
cases,
the
court
i
contend
to
you
has
always
held
that
unless
there
is
some
extraordinary
situation
usually
dealing
with
a
very
important
public
or
governmental
interest,
that
you
just
can't
do
it.
it
is
a
violation
of
fairness.
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i
certainly
would.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
and
the
next
thing
you
know,
the
court's
entering
orders,
and
he
doesn't
know
a
thing
about
it.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
absolutely
not.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
no
constitutional
question.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i
contend
that
you
certainly
are
not.
that
you
are
required
to
notice,
some
type
of
notice,
under
due
process
of
law,
as
to
when
your
case
is
going
to
be
heard.
now,
i
simply
note
the
diversity,
or
ask
you
all
to,
between
the
statute
as
drawn,
and
drawing
a
narrow
statute
to
where
the
legislature
says
now
we
see
that
this
--
something
could
happen,
where
real
lack
of
notice
would
be
proper.
i
would
contend
to
you,
and
i
don't
have
the
statistics,
but
at
least
50%
of
the
people
in
north
carolina
live
within
30
minutes
of
the
border.
charlotte's
clearly
in
mecklenburg
county
within
30
minutes
of
south
carolina.
the
triad
area,
winston-salem-greensboro-high
point's
within
30
minutes
of
greensboro.
we
actually
have,
you
know,
people
who
work
and
live
in
different
states,
and
so
on.
now
the
statute
says,
abandonment
and
that
he
has
left
the
state.
all
right.
now
abandonment's
going
to
be
one
of
her
allegations
in
most
alimony
cases.
that's
one
of
your
grounds.
that's
one
of
the
things
that's
supposed
to
be
contested
at
that
hearing.
the
fact
that
he
has
left
the
state
--
this
statute
doesn't
say
he
left
the
state
to
avoid
service
he
left
the
state
to
hide
left
the
state
--
the
fact
that
he
has
left
the
state,
in,
of,
and
by
itself,
is
not
dealt
with
in
that
statute,
except
to
say,
that
if
she
says
here
he
abandoned
me,
and
if
she
says
he
has
left
the
state,
she
doesn't
have
to
say
why.
and
the
court's
not
interested
in
why.
and
the
legislature
wasn't
interested
in
why.
but
they
can
go
to
court
without
notifying
the
man.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
it's
still
a
temporary
order.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes.
in
any
event
it
would.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
ex
parte.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
that
issue
is
not
here.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
it
should
have
been.
but
it's
not.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes,
it
is.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i'm
sure
that
i
did.
if
you
will
read
my
argument,
you
will
see
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
a
copy
of
that
brief
with
me.
and
i
can
just
simply
contend
to
you,
certainly
the
very
best
i
recollect
writing
that
brief
that
we
raised
the
constitutional
issue
in
that
brief.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
properly
raised
under
rule
16
at
this
time.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
it
is
raised
in
the
brief.
it
is
not
raised
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
yes.
and
you
raised
it,
and
--
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i
concede
that
you
don't,
your
honor.
finally,
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
try
to
address
the
application
of
the
statute
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
i
feel
that
it
is
very
clear
in
the
record
and
is
actually
found
by
the
court
order
of
the
district
court
judge
that
number
one,
of
course,
they
knew
counsel
of
record.
and
number
two,
they
knew
where
the
defendant
was
exactly.
now,
what
had
happened,
what
the
record
clearly
shows
is,
he
had
left
the
state
he
had
gone
to
his
home
in
fairfax
and
he
had
filed
a
further
custody
hearing
in
the
state
of
virginia
and
had
personally
served
those
papers
on
the
wife
who
was
in
north
carolina.
he
was
exercising
the
jurisdiction
at
that
time
down
in
the
north
carolina
courts,
but
attempting
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
of
the
virginia
courts.
that
was
the
reason
that
he
had
left
the
state.
and
that's
why
i
say
that's
one
of
the
things
primarily
wrong
with
this
statute.
all
it
says
is
left
the
state.
for
whatever
reason,
good
reason
or
bad
reason,
they
say
that
you
do
not
have
to
give
notice
in
that
statute.
mr.
john
f.
morrow
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
