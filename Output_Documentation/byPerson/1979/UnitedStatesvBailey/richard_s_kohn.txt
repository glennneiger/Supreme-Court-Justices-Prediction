mr.
richard
s.
kohn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
by
these
cases
is
whether
juries
can
be
trusted
to
find
the
facts
in
criminal
cases.
it
is
as
short
and
as
simple
as
that.
the
rule
that
the
government
asks
the
court
to
adopt
would
deprive
the
jury
of
considering
relevant
facts
concerning
the
events
surrounding
the
departure
of
a
prisoner
from
the
prison.
it
is
unique
and
affirmative
defenses.
i
know
of
no
other
affirmative
defense
that
would
place
a
substantive
limitation
on
the
ability
of
a
defendant
to
raise
an
affirmative
defense
to
a
charge
which
is
made
against
him.
the
number
of
state
supreme
courts
from
very
large
jurisdictions
such
as
michigan
and
illinois
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
there
are
certain
procedural
requirements
that
are
sometimes
attached
to
defenses,
such
as
notifying
the
prosecution
that
you
intend
to
advance
an
alibi
defense.
but
nothing
that
would
take
an
element
like
failure
to
return
and
make
that
the
sine
qua
non
of
raising
your
relevant
evidence.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
perhaps
in
a
civil
context
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
but
in
criminal
context
it
certainly
would.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
on
the
affirmative
sense
i
would
say
as
long
as
the
defendant
offers
some
evidence
of
duress
or
coercion,
then
that
would
come
in
and
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
there
would
be
a
minimum
of
threshold,
your
honor,
certainly
if
the
defendant
offered
zero
evidence
the
affirmative
defense
would
not
be
permitted
to
go
to
the
jury.
there
are
some
minimum
thresholds
which
the
court
really
doesn't
have
to
deal
with
in
this
case
because
the
evidence
was
so
substantial.
but
--
excuse
me.
but
there
are
cases,
and
the
government
cites
one
in
its
reply
in
its
reply
brief
state
v.
cross
where
the
court
characterized
the
defense
as
a
prisoner's
complaint
he
got
a
common
cold.
essentially
he
said
that
the
conditions
in
the
jail
were
cold.
and
even
though
they
talked
about
the
loverkamp
test,
that
kind
of
defense
probably
would
be
excluded
even
under
the
traditional
standard.
it
must
mean
that
there
has
to
be
some
immediate
threat
of
giving
rise
to
a
well-grounded
apprehension
of
serious
bodily
injury
or
death,
as
the
traditional
standard.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
certainly
it
impinges
on
the
fact-finding
function
of
the
jury,
your
honor.
but,
no,
we
would
argue
first
before
the
court
has
to
reach
any
constitutional
questions
that
just
as
a
matter
of
policy
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
that
raises
another
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor,
which
goes
to
the
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
that
would
answer
problems
i
believe
under
spence
v.
montana,
your
honor.
it
is
exactly
the
situation
in
this
case.
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
is
voluntariness.
the
duress
evidence
or
this
type
of
evidence
goes
to
negate
that
type
of
intent.
and
in
this
case
that
evidence
apparently
was
excluded
by
the
judge.
now,
even
if
congress
abolished
the
affirmative
defense
to
escape
tomorrow,
the
defendants
would
still
have
a
right
to
put
in
relevant
evidence
in
negating
their
intent,
which
is
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
certainly
not
in
terms
that
we
are
discussing
in
this
case.
we
are
concerned
with
threats
to
a
prisoner
of
serious
bodily
injury
or
harm.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
there
may
be
other
questions
regarding
intent.
essentially
the
court
in
this
case
discussed
that,
that
if
someone
leaves
a
jail
by
mistake
or
if
he
becomes
so
intoxicated
he
doesn't
know
what
he
is
doing,
it
may
negate
the
intent
but
the
prosecution
has
to
prove
to
make
that
act
criminal.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
sir.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
incorporates
the
concept
that
we
are
talking
about
in
terms
of
the
duress
defense.
the
supreme
courts
in
michigan,
illinois
and
new
mexico
have
adopted
a
flexible
rule
which
permits
evidence
of
failure
to
return
to
go
before
the
jury
and
which
goes
to
the
issue
of
credibility.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
don't
think
that
a
distinction
can
be
made
on
that
ground.
and
i
must
say
this.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
that
certainly
would
raise
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no,
i
think
that
that
would
still
raise
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
at
some
point
perhaps
you
could
say
there
was
no
longer
a
reasonable,
temporal
relationship
between
the
duress
that
caused
him
to
leave
and
his
staying
out.
but
as
long
as
there
is
some
evidence
such
as
was
introduced
in
this
case
by
the
defendants
that
they
didn't
want
to
go
back
because
they
thought
the
fbi
was
going
to
kill
them
if
they
found
them,
and
that
they
would
be
returned
to
the
northeast
1
tier
of
the
prison,
that
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
jury,
it
raises
a
factual
question.
and,
except
in
the
most
minimal
cases
where
there
is
essentially
no
evidence
at
all,
then
those
questions
create
issues
of
fact
for
the
jury.
a
good
example
of
why
a
flexible
rule
is
needed
is
set
forth
by
the
case
of
tidman
v.
commonwealth
in
a
kentucky
court
of
appeals
case
cited
by
12
southwestern
second
488
in
which
a
prisoner
had
one
month
left
to
serve
on
his
sentence
and
left
because
he
had
owed
a
debt
to
another
inmate
which
he
couldn't
pay
and
wasn't
threatened
with
homosexual
assaults
and
couldn't
find
a
guard
and
he
left.
and
two
days
later
he
was
arrested.
at
the
trial
the
judge
refused
to
let
in
the
evidence
that
he
had
only
one
month
to
go
on
his
sentence.
and
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
which
i
believe
is
the
highest
court
in
the
state,
reversed
and
said
that
that
was
very
relevant
evidence
for
the
jury
to
consider.
so
in
a
case
like
that,
if
a
man
is
arrested
before
he
has
a
chance
to
turn
himself
in
or
before
he
has
a
chance
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
contact
the
proper
authorities,
then
he
is
completely
barred
from
raising
the
duress
defense.
and
we
say
that
is
an
unreasonable
rule.
the
problem
here
is
how
do
you
deal
with
someone
who
has
escaped
from
prison,
an
unauthorized
leaving
of
the
prison.
and
when
he
is
captured
he
will
be
brought
back
and
he
may
be
prosecuted
for
escape,
and
at
that
time
he
should
be
able
to
give
an
explanation
for
why
he
left.
in
most
cases
it
perhaps
could
be
said
the
jury
will
not
accept
his
testimony.
juries
are
not
stupid,
contrary
to
what
appears
to
be
the
major
premise
of
the
government's
case.
and
the
defendant
will
have
to
convince
a
jury
that
his
reasons
for
leaving
in
fact
were
valid
and
that
his
staying
out
could
be
explained
in
some
manner.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
think
that
the
base
of
the
government's
case
is
the
feeling
that
the
juries
will
be
duped
by
prisoners
who
raise
these
defenses,
that
prisoners
will
get
together
and
conspire
to
create
stories
and
that
somehow
the
jury
will
not
be
able
to
sort
these
out.
and
i
think
that
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
we
have
confidence
in
the
juries
and
our
jury
system
to
decide
what
is
the
true
story
and
what
is
a
fabrication.
and,
in
that
connection
i
would
point
out
that
in
all
these
cases
when
the
prisoners
are
captured
they
will
be
brought
back
to
serve
out
their
original
sentence.
the
only
issue
is
whether
they
will
have
an
additional
punishment
put
on
them
for
their
unauthorized
leaving.
so
we
are
not
talking
about
acquittals
and
we
are
not
talking
about
turning
them
loose
on
society.
they
will
be
back
in
prison,
whatever
the
case.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
the
proper
circumstances
that
action
would
be
punished.
but
there
is
a
common
law
of
duress.
for
a
long
time
it
was
not
applied
in
escape
cases
but
that
is
changing
now
and
the
government
has
conceded
that
the
duress
defense
is
available
in
this
context.
so
if
a
prisoner
can
make
out
that
defense,
then
he
should
not
be
punished
under
the
congressional
act.
if
congress
wants
to
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
think
it
is
generally
permitted
in
both
state
and
federal
courts,
and
the
only
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
the
evidence
always
came
in
in
some
manner.
you
have
cases
like
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
historically,
it
was
recognized
by
hale
and
by
cluck
originally,
at
least
theoretically
but
apparently
it
was
not
applied
for
many
years
by
the
courts.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
i
think
that
after
the
luther
and
the
harmon
and
the
unger
cases
were
decided
in
the
state
courts
and
the
lovercamp
case,
it
started
to
be
accepted
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
is
correct.
that
is
on
a
common
law
basis.
a
common
law
basis.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no,
your
honor.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
at
least
in
this
case
the
question
of
whether
duress
defense
should
exist
at
all
is
not
before
the
court.
it
has
not
been
briefed
by
the
parties,
it
was
never
raised
below,
and
it
would
simply
be
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
that
issue
on
the
present
record.
but
the
trend
is
certainly
to
recognize
the
duress
defense
in
the
state
context
and
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
the
defendant
has
to
turn
himself
in
immediately
in
order
to
be
able
to
avail
himself
of
that
defense.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
even
though
the
duress
defense
was
not
available
in
the
escape
concept,
the
same
evidence
came
in
under
a
different
theory.
and
you
have
cases
like
woodring
and
jackson
which
the
government
relied
on
for
the
proposition
that
751
creates
a
continuing
offense
where
the
same
evidence
was
received
on
the
issue
of
an
offense
of
the
defendant.
and
in
both
those
cases,
as
i
recall
it
the
court
held,
or
the
jury
was
instructed
that
the
intent
required
was
an
intent
to
avoid
confinement.
and
then
they
went
ahead
and
they
considered
that
evidence.
and,
in
both
cases
it
was
rejected.
woodring
has
been
out
for
two
years
i
believe
after
leaving
mcneil
island
as
a
result
of
a
threat
and
the
court
held
that
the
jury
had
ample
basis
on
which
to
reject
his
evidence
that
he
did
not
have
sufficient
intent
and
in
chapman
i
believe
the
defendant
was
out
for
two
years
and
there
was
a
similar
result.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
they
are
two
separate
questions,
your
honor.
and
we
would
say
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record
even
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
the
return
requirement
is
an
essential
prerequisite
to
raising
the
duress
defense,
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
still
have
to
be
upheld
on
the
other
theory
that
the
trial
court
excluded
relevant
evidence
of
going
to
an
essential
element
of
the
offense,
which
was
voluntariness
and
intent.
with
respect
to
the
voluntariness
issue,
as
i
indicated
before
i
think
this
raises
substantial
problems
with
respect
to
sandstrom.
this
situation
would
have
been
no
different
if
the
trial
judge
had
instructed
the
jury.
if
you
find
that
the
defendants
failed
to
turn
themselves
in,
then
you
must
presume
that
when
they
left,
they
left
voluntarily.
and
wouldn't
it
have
been
any
different
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
saying
that.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
the
issues
of
voluntarinesss
and
intent
and
in
judge
wilkey's
dissent
on
pages
66-a
through
73-a
of
the
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
judge
wilkey
discussed
that.
and
respondent
was
to
show
how
the
majority
was
in
error,
unsuccessfully
i
believe.
but
what
was
common
among
the
majority
in
the
dissent,
and
which
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
between
the
parties
in
this
case,
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
of
escape
is
voluntariness
and
what
that
means
is
free
will,
or
as
judge
wilkey
said,
the
beast
compulsive
at
common
law.
and
if
the
defendant
has
evidence
that
shows
that
he
did
not
have
free
will
when
he
left
the
jail
--
in
other
words,
that
he
was
coerced,
then
that
evidence
must
go
to
the
jury,
the
factual
question.
and
the
effect
of
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case
was
to
take
it
away
from
the
jury.
now,
there
is
a
problem
with
the
record.
judge
wilkey
suggested
in
his
dissent
that
in
fact
all
the
trial
judge
did
was
instruct
the
jury
that
they
could
not
consider
the
evidence
with
relation
to
the
duress
defense.
but
when
you
read
the
judge's
instructions,
you
will
find
that
it
is
very
confusing.
and
i
believe
it
is
a
sandstrom
situation
where
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
don't
believe
that
is
assigned
as
error,
but
certainly
the
issues
of
what
evidence
was
to
go
to
the
jury
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
it
is
assumed
in
these
questions.
it
is
just
an
added
reason
why
the
court
may
want
to
decide
as
a
policy
matter
that
the
return
requirement
is
not
required
in
these
cases,
which
will
avoid
you
to
read
some
very
difficult
constitutional
questions
that
are
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
the
difficult
constitutional
questions
are
--
well,
first
of
all
the
court
would
have
to
interpret
751
to
determine
whether
it
just
stated
a
single
offense,
which
is
the
act
of
parting
or
as
the
government
suggests,
it
goes
further
and
creates
a
continuing
offense.
the
court
will
have
to
decide
that.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
and
if
the
court
agrees
that
the
statute
does
create
a
continuing
offense,
then
the
court
will
have
to
resolve
what
i
think
is
a
difficult
constitutional
question
of
what
does
that
mean
for
this
case.
the
majority
below
held
that
even
if
the
statute
does
create
a
continuing
offense,
the
continuing
offense
theory
was
not
the
basis
of
the
prosecution
in
this
case.
and
that,
in
effect,
you
cannot
deprive
the
jury
of
considering
a
defense
to
the
initial
departure
which
they
were
indicted
for
and
prosecuted
for
because
they
failed
to
turn
themselves
in,
which
incorporates
a
different
--
at
least
a
different
theory
of
escape.
and
that
involves
questions
of
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
believe
it
did,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
due
process
violation
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
on
was
that
the
government
in
effect
had
shifted
its
theory,
that
these
men
had
been
indicted
for
the
initial
departure,
that
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
they
were
defending.
that
was
certainly
the
basis
on
which
the
jury
was
instructed
and
that
right
in
the
middle
of
all
this
the
defendants
sought
to
raise
a
defense
that
went
to
the
initial
departure
and
were
told
that
they
couldn't
do
it
because
they
had
essentially
committed
a
separate
offense
of
remaining
absent
without
leave.
and
that
is
the
constitutional
violation
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
is
page
25-a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
if
i
may
read
it
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
let
me
--
it
is
on
probably
6-a,
your
honor,
in
the
first
line.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
the
court
of
appeals
said.
"in
effect
the
trial
court
denied
appellant's
right
to
have
the
jury
consider
a
duress
defense
to
a
crime
with
which
they
had
been
charged,
escaping
on
august
26.
because
the
court
found
that
they
would
in
any
event
be
guilty
of
an
offense
under
a
theory
of
failure
to
return,
it
was
never
presented
either
to
appellants
or
to
the
jury.
we
cannot
sanction
such
an
obvious
violation
of
appellant's
constitutional
right
to
jury
trial."
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
majority's
decision.
now,
there
is
another
issue
regarding
this
case
that
goes
beyond
the
voluntariness
concerns,
and
that
is
what
exactly
is
the
standard
of
intent
in
these
prosecutions.
the
government
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
is
only
with
respect
to
the
affirmative
defense,
your
honor,
i
believe.
well,
i
think
it
has
been
held
that
if
zero
evidence
is
introduced
in
support
of
an
affirmative
defense,
then
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
judge
to
give
it
to
the
jury.
but
these
are
very
sensitive
areas
and
i
really
wouldn't
want
to
speculate
as
to
what
the
minimum
threshold
was.
in
this
case
we
don't
have
that
problem
because
there
was
ample
evidence
that
when
these
men
left
they
were
under
duress,
there
was
substantial
evidence
of
threats
and
beatings
and
fires
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
and
there
was
also
evidence
that
once
they
got
out
they
felt
that
they
were
under
the
same
threats,
that
they
would
be
taken
back
to
the
same
jail
and
that
the
fbi
was
going
to
kill
them.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
don't
believe
it
had
to,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
i
think
if
this
court
--
well,
let
me
think
about
that.
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
return
requirement
is
not
an
absolute
bar
to
raising
the
defense
duress,
i
think
that
would
require
a
new
trial,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no.
the
court
didn't
decide
that,
your
honor.
the
only
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
the
only
reason
why
the
trial
judge
did
not
let
this
evidence
in
in
the
first
place
was
because
the
defendants
had
failed
to
return.
it
was
the
only
issue
--
it
was
the
only
issue
on
appeal.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
only
issue
on
appeal.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
i
suppose
that
is
true.
it
is
a
point
that
has
not
been
raised
by
the
government
and
i
--
i
guess
i
would
think
that
in
the
posture
of
the
case
if
this
court
agrees
that
the
return
requirement
was
not
properly
--
is
not
a
bar,
then
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
and
the
case
should
be
sent
back
and
the
government
can
decide
whether
they
want
to
re-prosecute
these
people.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
then
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
reach
these
other
questions
about
the
scope
of
the
statute,
the
constitutional
violation
which
the
court
decided
the
case
on
and
the
sense
from
problems
with
the
intent
issue.
the
court
would
have
to
go
on
to
decide
all
those
issues.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
the
court
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
the
court
could
resolve
that.
if
i
understand
what
your
honor
is
saying,
the
court
can
resolve
this
whole
case
just
by
saying
as
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
has
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has,
that
the
return
--
whether
or
not
the
standard
of
return
is
simply
a
matter
of
evidence
which
the
jury
can
consider.
the
court
can
decide
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
because
all
we
are
considering
here
is
a
common
law
defense.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
is
absolutely
right.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
except
that
we
have
argued
that
the
absolute
return
requirement
does
impinge
upon
the
fact-finding
function
of
the
jury.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no,
i
am
not
saying
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
am
certainly
not
saying
there
is
a
right
to
escape
here.
but
even
if
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
suppose
you
could
put
it
that
way.
i
wouldn't
want
to
characterize
it
as
that.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
it
is
just
the
defense.
it
is
just
like
a
self-defense
case.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
in
self-defense
exactly.
in
any
event,
there
is
a
constitutional
question
presented
--
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no,
i
think
there
are
probably
some
conditions
that
might
be
characterized
as
cruel
and
unusual
that
would
not
amount
to
the
serious
bodily
injury
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
area.
on
the
other
hand,
there
might
be
some
instances
of
threats
or
brutality
that
would
not
be
characterized
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
i
think
that
those
would
legitimately
be
raised
in
this
affirmative
defense
context.
so
i
think
it
is
misleading
to
start
using
the
eighth
amendment
and
saying
that
that
should
govern
this
sort
of
a
case.
it
certainly
is
arguable
and
i
might
like
to
argue
that
same
day
but
it
certainly
isn't
before
the
court
here.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
think
that
is
a
unique
situation,
your
honor,
because
there
are
plenty
of
avenues
for
appealing
convictions
and
death
sentences
and
practically
inexhaustible
review
procedures.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
no,
because
then
if
he
has
been
duly
found
guilty
and
all
of
his
legitimate
avenues
are
over,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
situation
with
these
other
case.
that
is
unique.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
if
someone
on
death
row
is
brutalized
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
don't
think
if
he
escapes
he
would
have
a
coercion
defense,
because
there
the
difference
is
--
and
the
whole
reason
why
we
have
this
affirmative
defense
that
there
are
some
situations
where
normal
avenues
of
review
are
just
not
available
to
prisoner.
the
situation
where
he
is
attacked
by
a
homosexual,
the
situations
that
exist
in
a
case,
state
v.
horne,
who
was
a
prisoner
in
hawaii
where
there
was
evidence
that
the
prison
was
totally
out
of
control
of
the
authorities.
prisoners
were
walking
around
carrying
guns
and
the
argument
was
made
that
every
prisoner
in
the
place
was
in
apprehension
of
serious
bodily
harm.
and
the
court
in
horne
said
that
that
can
go
to
the
jury,
a
duress
defense
can
go
to
the
jury.
but
the
difference
between
that
case
and
the
case
the
chief
justice
has
mentioned
is
that
the
authorities
were
totally
out
of
control,
there
are
no
legitimate
avenues
of
review.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
exactly.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
exactly.
now,
i
do
want
to
make
a
point
about
the
government's
other
intent
theory,
the
whole
specific
general
intent
controversy.
the
government
has
not
been
consistent
on
their
theory
since
this
whole
matter
began.
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
the
intent
element
was
that
they
must
have
acted
consciously
and
not
inadvertently.
on
appeal
they
argued
that
there
were
three
levels
of
intent.
consciousness
and
not
inadvertence
is
the
first
the
second
is
wrongful
and
the
third
is
purpose
or
specific
intent.
so
they
switched
the,
the
theory
it
appears
as
though
it
was
called
the
arkansas
situation.
we
said
that
in
our
brief,
that
they
are
arguing
on
appeal
in
that
the
standard
intent
of
law
is
wrongful
and
the
jury
was
instructed
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
find
consciousness
and
inadvertence,
then
that
was
called
the
arkansas
situation.
today
they
have
gone
back.
they
have
switched
back,
and
today
they
have
argued
that
the
proper
standard
of
intent
is
consciousness
and
inadvertence.
well,
we
think
that
alone
would
require
reversal
of
the
trial
court
and
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
on
intent.
but
just
to
speak
briefly
to
the
specific
intent
issue,
in
many
cases
such
as
woodring
and
chapman
even
though
the
courts
felt
that
the
statute
might
not
have
covered
specific
intent,
the
juries
were
instructed
in
those
terms.
the
case
went
to
the
jury
and
in
both
those
cases
the
jury
came
back
with
a
conviction.
the
whole
point
of
the
court
of
appeals
attempt
here
was
to
clarify
the
law
and
to
get
away
from
the
labels
of
specific
intent
and
general
intent
which
really
are
meaningless
unless
you
try
to
figure
out
what
the
purpose
of
the
crime
is,
what
the
purpose
of
the
offense
is.
and
the
court
quite
recently
said,
well,
in
the
escape
statute
what
society
is
trying
to
do
is
punish
someone
who
escapes
with
the
intent
to
avoid
confinement.
if
he
escapes
for
another
reason,
to
save
his
skin,
essentially
it
is
a
self-defense
measure,
then
the
matter
is
not
what
congress
intended
to
punish.
it
is
really
no
different
than
what
judge
wilkey
described
as
the
free
will
of
these
compulsive
notion
of
intent,
that
if
you
escape
because
of
some
form
of
coercion
that
creates
in
your
mind
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
fear
of
death
or
bodily
injury,
then
you
don't
have
the
requisite
state
of
mind
and
perhaps
you
don't
pose
the
same
threat
to
society
as
someone
who
just
gets
out
and
wants
to
regain
his
freedom
and
goes
for
broke.
and
i
must
point
out
that
anyone
who
escapes,
if
he
commits
other
crimes
while
he
is
out,
of
course
is
subject
to
prosecution
for
those
crimes
and
will
be
treated
the
same
as
anybody
else.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
thank
you,
mr.
chife
justice.
