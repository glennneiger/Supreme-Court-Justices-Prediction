justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
jury
convicted
these
defendants,
didn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
how
can
we
be
sure
just
what
the
jail
conditions
were,
since
presumably
the
jury
was
entitled
to
disbelieve
the
testimony
of
witnesses
heard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
claim
of
release
in
a
civil
action,
which
is
an
affirmative
defense
and
you
show
the
judge
what
you
propose
to
do
for
his
release
and
he
says
as
a
matter
of
law
that
is
not
a
release.
there
is
no
problem
there,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
any
evidence
that
a
defendant
wants
to
offer
comes
in
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
judge
says,
"i
want
to
share
in
share
in
chamber
what
you
propose
to
offer
in
the
way
of
duress,"
and
says,
"this
isn't
even
some
evidence,
so
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
offer
it"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
say
some
state
doesn't
have
it.
say
some
state
doesn't
have
it
and
that
a
defendant
nevertheless
says,
"judge,
i
am
going
to
offer
some
evidence
that
i
was
under
duress."
and
the
judge
says,
"what
for"?
and
he
says,
"well,
i
think
it
ought
to
be
a
good
defense."
and
the
judge
says,
"we
just
don't
recognize
it
in
this
state.
the
evidence
is
excluded."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
congress
has
specified
that
escape
is
separately
punishable
felony.
it
isn't
the
idea
that
it
is
just
make
good
on
your
original
sentence,
when
you
escape
you
commit
a
separate
felony.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
this
the
theory,
that
the
court
of
appeals
majority
preceded
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
assign
that
as
error
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
the
difficult
constitutional
questions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
any
constitutional
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
majority
below
didn't
rest
its
holding
on
constitutional
grounds,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
have
in
mind
that
page
of
the
record
where
the
court
of
appeals,
the
jury
talks
about
the
constitutional
issue?
if
you
don't,
i
will
certainly
look
at
it
any
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
does
it
say
anything
about
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
this
court
decides
that
the
return
requirement
is
an
essential
element
of
duress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
we
could
decide
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
the
defendant
must
return
within
a
particular
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
certainly
no
constitutional
issue
involved.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
freedom
to
escape?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
freedom
to
escape?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
no.
78-990,
united
states
versus
bailey
and
the
companion
case
of
united
states
against
cogdell
involves
the
construction
of
a
prison
escape
statute.
in
19776,
clifford
bailey,
james
cogdell,
ronald
cooley,
and
ralph
walker
escaped
from
the
district
of
columbia
jail
where
they
were
being
held
in
federal
custody
as
a
result
of
being
either
convicted
of
or
arrested
for
various
felonies.
the
fbi
recaptured
these
four
men
separately
after
they
had
remained
at
large
anywhere
from
one
to
three
and
one
half
months
and
charged
them
with
violating
18
u.s.c.
section
751
(a)
which
makes
escape
from
federal
custody
a
crime.
at
their
trial,
each
of
the
defendants
attempted
to
prove
that
he
was
forced
to
escape
by
the
conditions
that
escape
of
the
d.c.
jail
during
the
summer
of
1976.
these
alleged
conditions
included
trash
fires,
objects
thrown
from
the
cells,
attempted
beatings
of
prisoners
by
guards
and
failure
to
provide
adequate
medical
care.
at
each
of
the
trials,
the
district
judge
inquired
into
the
defendant's
conduct
after
they
freed
themselves
from
the
allegedly
oppressive
conditions
of
the
jail.
cogdell
and
cooley,
each
of
whom
had
remained
at
large
for
one
month
offered
no
evidence
of
any
attempt
to
surrender.
bailey
who
had
eluded
the
fbi
for
almost
three
months
testified
that
he
had
someone
contact
the
jail
officials
but
that
he
did
not
turn
himself
in
because
he
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
the
d.c.
jail
and
because
someone
had
told
him
that
the
fbi
would
kill
him
if
they
caught
him.
walker
testified
that
he
spoke
on
the
telephone
with
an
fbi
agent
three
times
in
an
attempt
to
negotiate
a
surrender
but
that
he
broke
off
communications
when
the
agent
could
not
promise
him
that
they
would
not
be
sent
back
to
the
d.c.
jail.
he
remained
at
large
another
two
months
before
the
fbi
recaptured
him.
at
the
trial
for
prison
escape,
the
district
judge
ruled
that
because
the
defendants
had
remained
at
large
long
after
freeing
themselves
from
the
allegedly
oppressive
conditions
of
the
jail,
evidence
of
those
conditions
was
irrelevant
to
the
question
whether
they
had
violated
section
751
(a).
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
evidence
of
the
conditions
that
they
jail
was
relevant
in
determining
whether
the
defendants
had
the
necessary
intent
to
commit
the
crime
of
escape.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
an
escapee
was
not
guilty
of
violating
section
751
(a)
unless
he
left
custody
in
order
to
avoid
the
normal
conditions
of
confinement
as
opposed
to
conditions
which
included
trash
fires
and
beatings.
today
we
hold
in
turning
the
file
with
the
clerk
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
requiring
proof
of
such
an
intent.
section
751
(a)
prohibits
knowingly
escaping
from
physical
custody.
that
section
includes
within
its
literal
terms
prisoners
who
escape
from
custody
to
avoid
any
aspect
of
their
confinement
normal
or
otherwise.
it
may
be
that
a
prisoner
who
is
threatened
with
death
or
serious
bodily
injury
might
be
able
to
defend
an
escape
charge
on
the
grounds
of
duress
or
necessity.
such
defenses
however
are
available
only
if
the
defendant
had
no
reasonable
alternative
to
violating
the
law.
here,
bailey,
cooley,
cogdell,
and
walker
violated
section
751
(a)
not
only
by
their
initial
escape
but
also
by
their
continued
absence
from
federal
custody.
whatever
justification
they
had
for
escaping
from
jail
on
the
first
place,
they
offered
no
legally
sufficient
reason
for
remaining
at
large
up
to
three
and
a
half
months.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
district
court
did
not
err
in
removing
the
evidence
of
conditions
of
the
jail
from
consideration
by
the
jury.
the
judgment
of
court
of
--
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
reversed
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
reinstatement
of
the
judgments
of
the
district
court.

justice
