it
is
not
only
a
threat
from
those
inside
the
prison,
from
people
inside
the
prison
--
fellow
inmates
or
custodians
--
that
might
in
some
circumstances
justify
escape,
is
it?
way
back
in
the
early
18th
century
hale
talked
about
the
hypothetical
case
of
a
prison
catching
fire.
justice

stewart
not
duress,
but
rather
necessity.
justice

standard
defense
in
any
criminal
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
hasn't
been
duress,
historically.
it
was
not
a
defense
to
escape,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case,
aren't
there?
you
said
two
questions
are
enlisted
by
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari,
as
i
remember,
and
we
granted
the
petition
without
limitation.
one
is
whether
a
state
requires
a
generalized
or
specific
intent.
justice
potter
stewart
quite
apart
from
that
question
of
duress.
and,
secondly,
if
there
is
interposed
a
defense
of
duress
must
there
be
a
showing
by
the
defendant
that
he
turned
himself
in
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
escape.
aren't
those
two
separate
issues?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
like
duress
in
any
criminal
case,
it
is
not
a
right
to
kill
somebody.
but
if
somebody
else
forces
you
to
do
it,
you
might
have
a
defense
to
a
charge
of
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
argue
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
escape
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
the
prison?
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
ask
this
case.
would
you
say
generally?
justice
potter
stewart
recommend
them
all?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
if
he
is
apprehended
very
promptly
after
his
escape,
he
can
always
testify
that
he
intended
to
return.
justice
potter
stewart
he
might
be
apprehended
when
he
was
going
around
the
block?
justice
potter
stewart
he
could
testify
he
was
on
his
way
back.
that
he
was
ready
to
turn
himself
in.
that
was
the
lovercamp
case.
