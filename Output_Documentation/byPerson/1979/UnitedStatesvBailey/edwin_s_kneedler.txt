mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
cases
arise
under
the
federal
statute
18
united
states
code
section
751
that
prohibits
a
person
from
escaping
from
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
or
from
any
custody
in
which
he
was
placed
under
federal
law
pursuant
to
court
order.
there
are
two
issues
presented.
first
is
whether
in
establishing
the
intent
element
of
the
crime
of
escape,
the
government
is
required
to
prove
merely
that
the
defendant
left
the
prison
consciously,
not
inadvertently.
in
addition,
the
government
prove
that
the
defendant
intended
to
avoid
only
those
aspects
of
confinement
in
the
prison
that
may
be
regarded
as
normal.
under
the
latter
formulation
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
a
prisoner
who
deliberately
left
a
prison
but
did
so
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
certain
harsh
conditions
there
would
not
commit
the
crime
of
the
state.
the
second
issue
concerns
the
nature
of
the
showing
a
defendant
in
an
escape
case
must
make
under
section
751
in
order
to
raise
the
defense
duress.
this
defense
has
long
been
recognized
that
the
common
law
and
generally
in
federally
criminal
prosecutions.
the
court
must
decide
here
whether
a
defendant
who
raises
the
duress
offense
in
an
escape
prosecution
must
show
that
he
was
threatened
with
imminent
serious
harm
at
the
time
of
his
departure
from
the
jail.
and
whether
he
can
raise
the
defense
if
he
remained
in
hiding
after
he
departed
from
prison.
respondents
bailey,
walker
and
cooley
were
convicted
following
a
jury
trial
and
escaped
from
the
district
of
columbia
jail.
each
was
sentenced
to
five
years
imprisonment
to
serve
consecutively
to
sentences
previously
imposed.
respondent
cooley
was
convicted
in
a
later
jury
trial
of
escaping
from
the
district
of
columbia
jail
as
well
and
he
too
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
five
years.
prior
to
the
escape
respondent
bailey
had
been
serving
a
sentence
in
the
leavenworth
penitentiary
on
conviction
of
bank
robbery
and
attempted
escape
but
he
was
brought
to
the
district
of
columbia
to
testify
in
a
pending
criminal
case.
respondent
walker
was
also
serving
a
sentence
in
the
leavenworth
penitentiary
on
conviction
of
bank
robbery
and
he
too
was
brought
to
the
district
of
columbia
to
testify.
respondent
cooley
was
serving
his
sentence
in
the
district
of
columbia
jail
based
on
a
conviction
for
unlawful
possession
of
firearms.
the
evidence
at
the
trial
of
these
three
respondents
showed
that
they
left
the
jail
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
august
26,
1976
by
crawling
through
a
window
in
the
northeast
1
unit
of
the
district
of
columbia
jail,
which
was
the
maximum
security
facility
at
the
jail.
they
were
apprehended
by
fbi
agents
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
november
19,
december
13
and
september
27,
respectively,
which
was
from
one
to
three
months
after
their
departure
from
the
jail.
respondents
did
not
dispute
at
trial
that
they
left
the
jail
without
permission
and
that
they
had
remained
in
hiding
until
they
were
apprehended.
but
they
sought
to
justify
their
escape
by
introducing
evidence
of
what
they
contended
were
intolerable
conditions
in
the
jail.
early
in
the
trial
and
on
several
occasions
thereafter
the
government
argued
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
raise
the
defense
of
duress
because
they
had
not
surrendered
to
custody
promptly
after
their
departure.
the
court
agreed
with
the
government
on
this
point
and
several
times
informed
respondents
to
that
point.
they
chose
to
allow
them
to
present
their
evidence
of
jail
conditions
and
to
wait
until
the
end
of
the
trial
to
determine
whether
evidence
was
in
the
record
to
support
a
finding
that
they
had
satisfied
the
return
requirement.
the
three
respondents
and
several
other
inmates
and
several
jail
officials
then
testified
about
certain
conditions
in
the
jail.
there
was
testimony
that
trash,
sheets,
mattresses
and
similar
items
were
burned,
some
of
the
testimony
suggested
frequently,
during
the
summer
of
1976
prior
to
the
escape.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
was
testimony
from
several
inmates
that
there
had
been
certain
things
burned
by
guards.
there
was
a
description
of
a
guard
who
--
burning
some
trash.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
we
don't.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
for
purposes
of
the
case
in
this
this
court,
the
respondents'
evidence
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
most
favorably
to
them.
so
to
that
extent
for
purposes
of
this
case
we
are
considering
the
facts
as
presented
to
be
true.
but
we
do
not
concede
for
example
that
the
conditions
of
the
fires
even
as
described
presented
the
type
of
threat
of
imminent
serious
bodily
injury
or
harm
that
the
duress
defense
has
usually
been
reserved
for.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right,
but
the
--
but
after
the
judge
had
instructed
them
at
the
close
of
the
trial,
the
judge
concluded
that
there
was
not
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
the
jury
could
find
that
they
had
satisfied
the
return
requirement
of
duress
defense
they
had
not
surrendered
to
custody.
and
therefore
he
did
not
give
them
duress
instruction
and
directed
the
jury
not
to
consider
the
jail
conditions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
surely,
yes,
that
is
right.
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
record
as
it
comes
to
the
court
that
there
is
not
a
jury
verdict
that
took
into
account
the
jail
conditions.
so
again,
the
evidence
has
to
be
considered
in
the
manner
presented
by
the
respondents.
in
addition
to
the
evidence
of
the
fires,
respondents
cooley
and
bailey
also
presented
some
testimony
that
they
were
beaten
by
guards
during
the
summer
and
that
they
were
threatened
with
similar
action.
respondent
walker
did
not
base
his
duress
on
such
beating
but
did
allege
that
he
had,
and
sought
to
establish
that
he
had
received
inadequate
medical
treatment
for
an
alleged
epileptic
condition.
finally,
respondent
cooley
also
at
one
time
testified
that
he
left
on
the
morning
of
the
26th
because
he
had
been
threatened
by
bailey
and
walker,
but
he
later
admitted
that
there
was
no
one
outside
the
cell
when
he
left,
that
the
threats
occurred
later
and
he
didn't
know
whether
bailey
and
walker
had
actually
left.
the
respondents
also
sought
to
testify
about
certain
actions
that
happened
after
they
escaped.
respondent
walker
testified
that
he
made
three
telephone
calls
to
the
fbi.
the
agent
with
whom
he
spoke,
walker
testified,
assured
him
that
he
would
not
be
harmed
if
he
surrendered
but
refused
to
guarantee
that
he
would
not
be
returned
in
to
the
district
of
columbia
jail
if
he
did
surrender.
respondent
bailey
testified
that
he
had
someone
else
call
the
authorities
but
he
didn't
identify
who
that
was
and
he
admitted
that
he
didn't
make
any
telephone
calls
himself
or
make
any
other
effort
to
turn
himself
in.
respondent
cooley's
testimony
on
this
point
is
somewhat
ambiguous
but
it
can
be
read
to
suggest
that
certain
members
of
his
family
may
have
tried
unsuccessfully
to
get
in
touch
with
authorities.
and
the
government
did
present
witnesses
in
an
effort
to
rebut
this
testimony
and
had
the
duress
defense
been
presented
to
the
jury,
then
this
government
evidence
would
have
come
into
play.
as
i
mentioned,
at
the
close
of
trial
the
court
denied
respondents'
request
for
jury
instruction.
it
also
instructed
the
jury
that
escape
is
a
general
intent
crime
and
in
explaining
that
the
court
stated
that
general
intent
only
requires
to
do
an
act
consciously
or
purposely
rather
than
inadvertently.
and
by
this,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
the
court
was
referring
to
the
act
of
leaving
the
prison.
the
evidence
at
respondent
cogdell's
trial
showed
that
he
also
left
the
district
of
columbia
jail
on
the
26th
and
he
was
apprehended
hiding
in
a
closet
in
a
residence
in
hyattsville,
maryland
about
a
month
later.
respondent
cogdell
also
offered
that
his
departure
was
compelled
by
prison
conditions,
but
because
he
too
had
not
surrendered
the
court
rejected
his
proffered
testimony
and
the
duress
defense.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
in
both
cases.
the
court
of
appeals,
one
judge
dissenting,
reversed
the
convictions
and
remanded
some
new
trials.
the
court
of
appeals
found
two
bases
on
which
the
jury
could
have
or
should
have
been
able
to
consider
the
evidence
of
the
jail
conditions
prior
to
the
departure.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
this
evidence
bore
on
the
question
of
intent.
in
the
court
of
appeals
view,
once
a
defendant
in
an
escape
case
has
introduced
evidence
of
what
the
court
would
term
abnormal
conditions
of
confinement,
there
is
at
least
a
question
raised
as
to
whether
the
defendant
actually
intended
to
leave
confinement
as
such
or
whether
he
was
really
motivated
by
a
desire
to
avoid
those
unpleasant
conditions.
accordingly,
the
court
held
that
it
made
him
guilty
of
escape
only
if
he
had
the
intent
to
avoid
abnormal
conditions
of
confinement.
the
court
also
concluded
that
respondents'
evidence
of
jail
conditions
was
sufficient
to
raise
a
jury
question
under
the
duress
defense,
but
in
doing
so
the
court
stated
that
the
traditional
rule
of
duress
defense,
that
it
can
be
raised
only
where
the
defendant
acted
out
of
immediate
threat
of
serious
harm
should
be
relaxed
in
the
prison
escape
context
because
the
opportunity
for
a
prisoner
to
escape
may
not
remain
available,
while
a
substantial
threat
would
right
that
into
an
immediate
one.
finally,
the
district
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
imposing
a
firm
return
requirement
for
defendant
after
he
departed
from
custody.
the
court
advocated
that
the
failure
of
a
prisoner
to
return
to
custody
was
essentially
a
fact
for
the
jury
to
consider
in
determining
whether
his
continued
absence
might
be
justified
by
a
possible
continuation
of
the
conditions
that
led
him
to
depart.
government's
suggestion
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
denied
and
the
government
then
petitioned
for
certiorari.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
if
affirmed
by
this
court
could
have
serious
ramifications
for
the
courts
in
interpreting
the
law
of
escape
and
as
a
result
could
also
have
serious
consequences
for
the
order
and
security
of
the
district
of
columbia
jail,
the
federal
penal
system
generally
and
society
at
large.
escape
carries
with
it
a
substantial
potential
for
violence,
even
where
the
inmate
himself
does
not
intend
to
resort
to
violence.
escapes
also
disrupt
the
order
of
the
prison
and
cause
understandable
apprehension
among
the
public.
for
these
reasons
and
because
escape
demonstrates
contempt
for
the
rule
of
law,
escape
has
been
traditionally
treated
as
a
serious
crime.
any
effort
to
justify
or
excuse
an
escape
must
therefore
be
treated
with
considerable
caution.
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
a
prisoner
does
not
commit
an
offense
if
he
escapes
to
avoid
certain
adverse
conditions
of
confinement
rather
than
confinement
as
such,
finds
no
support
in
case
law,
federal
or
state.
moreover,
the
court's
distinction
between
what
is
called
normal
and
non-normal
conditions
of
confinement
is
not
fully
articulated
in
the
opinion.
and
the
basis
of
that
distinction
is
not
wrong.
for
example,
it
isn't
clear
whether
all
jail
situations
that
this
court
might
find
to
be
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
would
be
considered
to
be
non-normal,
at
least
as
traditionally
determined,
and
therefore
justify
a
prisoner
in
escaping.
there
is
also
no
expressed
requirement
as
the
intent
argument
is
formulated
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
these
adverse
conditions
present
an
immediate
threat
to
the
safety
or
health
or
life
of
the
prisoner.
therefore,
the
manner
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
the
intent
element
introduces
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
and
vagueness
into
the
crime
of
escape
and
causes
prisoners,
would
cause
corruptions
officials
and
juries
and
judges
to
speculate
and
guess
as
to
what
types
of
conditions
might
excuse
an
escape.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
treatment
of
the
intent
element
has
the
effect
of
converting
an
escape
into
a
self-help
remedy
by
which
the
prisoner
may
seek
to
avoid
the
conditions
of
confinement
that
are
unsatisfactory
to
him
rather
than
resorting
to
legal
remedies.
in
this
case
the
respondents
indisputably
intended
to
leave
the
district
of
columbia
jail,
whatever
may
have
been
their
motivation
in
doing
so.
and
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
the
government
should
have
to
prove
anything
more
than
that
in
making
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
escape.
the
court
of
appeals
evident
concern
about
the
dilemma
of
a
prisoner
who
faces
truly
threatening
conditions
in
a
jail
is
therefore
better
dealt
with
not
in
the
intent
element
which
is
part
of
the
government's
case
in
chief,
but
where
it
has
traditionally
been
addressed
and
that
is
in
the
affirmative
defense
of
duress.
that
defense
has
over
the
years
embodied
the
societal
and
legal
judgment
there
are
occasions
when
it
is
inappropriate
to
punish
a
person
because
his
conduct
was
compelled
by
external
forces.
the
duress
defense
has
long
recognized
that
at
least
in
some
circumstances
a
person
cannot
fairly
be
blamed
for
his
conduct
in
those
situations.
the
conduct
of
one
who
acts
under
compulsion
is
still
criminal
because
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
are
present,
including
the
intent
to
act.
but
even
though
criminal,
the
conduct
is
excused
for
reasons
of
social
policy.
it
is
apparent
however
that
the
defense
of
duress
carries
with
it
the
seeds
of
potential
disorder
because
it
allows
a
judge
and
jury
to
excuse
conduct
in
a
particular
case
that
the
representatives
of
the
people
have
chosen
to
make
criminal
and
because
it
may
also
create
an
incentive
for
a
defendant
to
claim
falsely
that
he
acted
under
coercion
when
it
will
be
quite
difficult
for
the
prosecution
to
disprove
those
suggestions
of
coercion.
as
a
result,
the
duress
defense
has
historically
been
hedged
with
restrictions
which
stick
to
limit
its
applications
to
situations
in
which
the
individual
had
no
reasonable
choice
but
to
commit
the
offense.
thus
the
defendant
is
excused
only
if
he
acted
under
a
threat
of
what
he
reasonably
believed
to
be
serious
personal
injury
or
death.
and
that
is
aggravated
circumstances
in
order
society
requires
an
individual
would
stand
a
threat
rather
than
break
the
law.
further,
the
threatened
harm
must
be
unavoidable
because
if
there
are
other
legal
recourses
available
there
is
no
reason
to
permit
the
individual
to
resort
to
illegal
methods.
and
finally,
in
order
to
be
excused
the
criminal
conduct
may
not
be
of
any
greater
magnitude
or
duration
than
is
reasonably
necessary
to
avoid
the
threatened
harm.
duress
has
always
been
theoretically
available
as
a
defense
in
a
prison
escape
case.
but,
the
courts
have
been
understandably
reluctant
to
excuse
a
prisoner
when
he
claims
that
his
departure
was
compelled
by
circumstances
of
confinement,
because
after
all
confinement
itself
is
objectionable
to
many
people.
accordingly,
most
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue
have
required
the
defendant
to
satisfy
certain
prerequisites
to
raising
a
duress
defense.
these
are
not
novel,
however
they
are
merely
adaptations
of
the
general
rules
that
i
have
just
articulated
for
the
duress
defense
generally.
again,
the
prisoner
must
fear
an
imminent
threat.
second,
there
must
be
no
lawful
means
available
to
the
prisoner
to
avoid
it,
such
a
resort
to
prison
grievance
prison
system,
prison
officials
or
the
courts.
and
finally,
the
courts
have
insisted
that
the
prisoner
return
to
custody
promptly
or
report
to
authorities
in
meaningful
fashion
after
the
departure
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
defense.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right.
it
does
not
have
to
be
caused
by
a
person.
traditionally,
the
fire
situation
would
have
been
dealt
as
part
of
a
defense
of
necessity
which
is
usually
thought
of
as
natural
forces
as
opposed
to
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
necessity.
the
case
is
discussing
these
two
defenses
in
the
escape
context
intended
to
merge
them
or
not
rather
to
significantly
distinguish
them
because
in
some
respects
duress
is
not
an
especially
apt
name
for
the
defense
either.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
would.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
defense
--
duress
defense
is
never
applicable
in
prison
escape
cases.
but
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
prison
conditions
must
be
severe,
perhaps
not
as
severe
as
you
suggested
in
that
example
but
they
must
be
what
judge
wilkey
in
dissent
called
back-to-the-wall
situations
where
the
person
is
truly
faced
with
a
human
dilemma
that
the
law
simply
has
to
forgive.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
as
i
understand
it
mail
is
freely
permitted
to
be
sent
out.
this
was
a
maximum
security
facility
however
so
there
limitations,
for
example
telephone
calls.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
local
newspapers
or
to
an
attorney,
church,
citizen
groups,
and
that
type
of
thing.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
return
requirement
for
a
moment.
there
are
two
possible
ways
in
which
the
return
requirement
could
be
explained.
some
courts
have
found
it
useful
in
discussing
the
return
requirement
to
characterize
escape
as
a
continuing
offense
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
necessarily
consummated
at
the
time
the
person
first
gains
his
freedom
but
it
continues
for
as
long
as
he
remains
at
large.
under
this
approach,
this
approach
to
describing
the
return
requirement
then
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right
that
is
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
am
explaining
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
that
is
right.
the
continuing
offense
description
that
i
have
just
given
brings
the
return
requirement
into
consistency
in
the
duress
defense
generally.
as
i
mentioned
before,
one
of
the
traditional
elements
of
the
duress
defense
is
that
the
individual
can
have
engaged
in
the
conduct
for
no
longer
than
the
threat
remains
outstanding.
well,
in
the
situation
in
which
a
person
escapes
from
prison
unlawfully,
his
departure
is
unlawful
and
his
absence
from
custody
is
unlawful.
so
as
long
as
he
remains
there
is
no
excuse.
so
as
long
as
he
remains
at
large
he
is
continuing
to
engage
in
an
unlawful
activity.
but
once
he
is
out
of
prison
he
is
no
longer
directly
confronted
in
the
back-to-the-wall-type
situation
by
the
threats
that
led
him
to
depart.
and
so
because
the
imminent
harm
is
no
longer
present
and
because
he
even
more
readily
has
legal
means
available,
then
he
is
no
longer
permitted
--
at
that
point
the
duress
defense
stops
excusing
his
continued
absence
from
prison.
now,
another
way
in
which
the
return
requirement
may
be
explained
is
by
giving
it
as
a
condition
subsequent
that
the
defendant
must
satisfy
in
order
to
raise
the
defense.
under
this
approach,
as
i
have
mentioned
the
original
departure
continues
to
be
a
crime
but
it
is
one
that
can
be
excused,
the
return
requirement
is
a
condition
which
the
law
attaches
to
the
excuse
in
order
for
the
defendant
to
take
advantage
of
it.
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
the
duress
defense
in
criminal
prosecution
is
traditionally
a
fashion
defense
and
it
is
reasonable
for
the
court
to
fashion
it
in
the
escape
context
by
resort
to
some
common
sense.
and
in
this
particular
situation
i
believe
common
sense
would
suggest
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
a
person
who
may
have
initially
fled
confinement
because
of
an
imminent
fear
of
serious
injury
could
thereafter
remain
free
with
impunity
and
not
have
to
take
some
measures
to
put
himself
back
into
custody
safely.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
are
not
suggesting
at
all
that
it
is
a
separate
crime.
by
my
hypothesis
on
the
date
mentioned
in
the
indictment
he
committed
no
crime.
no,
he
did
commit
a
crime
but
it
is
one
that
is
excused
by
the
affirmative
defense
of
duress.
duress
does
not
go
to
any
element
of
the
offense
itself.
it
does
not
negate
the
intent,
for
example.
he
still
intended
to
leave
even
though
he
may
have
done
so
in
some
sense
without
volition.
so
he
committed
a
crime.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
that
is
several
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
several
of
the
state
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue
have
looked
at
the
return
requirement
as
nothing
more
than
that,
as
evidence
of
what
the
person
did
afterward
suggests
that
he
really
didn't
leave
out
of
a
good
motive
but
wanted
to
leave.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right.
i
mean
as
a
matter
of
law
under
our
approach
the
return
is
not
simply
an
evidentiary
matter,
the
importance
of
which
the
jury
can
consider
but
it
is
an
essential
element
of
the
defense
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
right
yes,
sir.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
two
minutes
later
or
something
that
should
apply.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would
just
like
to
make
a
few
points.
the
government
did
not
concede
voluntariness
as
an
element
of
the
crime
of
escape.
what
we
contended
was
that
the
intent
was
an
element
of
the
crime
of
escape.
the
intent
to
do
the
act
in
the
escape
context
is
intent
to
avoid
confinement.
voluntariness
--
when
a
person
is
compelled
to
do
something
because
of
external
forces,
he
still
intends
to
do
the
act
but
he
is
excused
from
liability
for
that
under
the
duress
defense,
under
the
affirmative
defense
of
duress.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
government
has
not
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
evidence
presented
constituted
satisfaction
of
the
immediacy
requirement
of
the
duress
defense.
and,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question,
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
that
the
evidence
presented
to
the
jury
was
adequate
to
support.
the
district
court
did
not
have
occasion
to
rule
on
that
question
and
the
government
did
not
focus
on
it
at
the
trial
court
level
because
the
focus
was
on
the
return
requirement.
and,
finally,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
that
the
significance
of
the
return
requirement
again
is
not
simply
that
it
is
evidence
that
the
prisoner's
intent
when
he
first
left
the
jail
was
in
fact
to
just
get
free
rather
than
to
avoid
harsh
conditions.
the
return
requirement
is
a
subsequent
development
of
the
defense
of
duress
itself
and
there
has
to
be
adequate
evidence
presented
in
the
record
on
every
element
of
affirmative
defense
in
order
for
the
judge
to
send
that
defense
to
the
jury.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
again
i
think
it
might
depend
on
the
type
of
duress
to
which
he
was
subject.
if
the
duress
he
is
claiming
is
a
threat
from
one
inmate
who
had
just
gone
mad
or
something
on
occasion,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
particular
excuse
for
remaining
at
large
very
long
after
that
because
it
would
be
possible
to
simply
climb
out
of
a
window
or
whatever
the
avenue
of
escape
was
and
go
around
to
the
front
door
and
say,
so
and
so
has
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
right
sure
yes,
exactly.
but
i
--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
sure.
exactly.
ok,
the
government
respectfully
requests
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
