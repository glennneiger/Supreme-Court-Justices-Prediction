burned
by
guards
as
well
as
by
inmates?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
government
concedes
that
some
of
these
conditions
were
"intolerable"?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
concede?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
real
question
is
whether
there
is
a
requirement.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
assuming
there
is
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
giving
an
argument.
justice
byron
r.

mr.
kneedler,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
both
of
your
theories,
and
i
may
have
it
entirely
right
in
my
mind,
but
in
both
of
those
theories
you
in
effect
are
saying
that
there
is
a
sort
of
a
second
offense.
take
a
hypothetical
case
where
a
man
in
fact
is
subject
to
duress,
in
fear
of
life
at
the
time
he
leaves
and
ten
days
later
he
has
calmed
down,
he
is
in
the
hospital
or
something
and
he
has
had
a
chance
to
think
it
over
and
he
decides,
well,
i
would
like
to
stay
out
and
i
am
no
longer
under
duress
but
i
am
not
going
to
go
back.
now,
clearly
he
has
committed
the
crime
of
escape
ten
days
later
at
that
time.
couldn't
you
prosecute
him
for
that
escape
in
the
alternative
by
saying
in
effect
(1)
you
escaped
by
walking
through
the
doors
and
(2)
you
never
came
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
don't
quite
--
is
that
your
theory,
that
it
is
a
separate
crime
and
if
so,
is
your
indictment
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
neither
submission
you
are
not
contending
that
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
go
back
is
probative
on
the
issue
of
whether
he
really
was
under
duress
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
argue
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
theory
would
have
to
go
to
a
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
say
that
the
duress
defense
is
constitutionally
required,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
status
of
law
in
the
federal
courts
on
duress
as
a
defense
to
escape?
