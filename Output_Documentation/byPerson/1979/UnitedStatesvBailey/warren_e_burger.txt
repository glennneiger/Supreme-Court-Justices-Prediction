the
hearing
next
is
the
united
states
v.
clifford
bailey.
mr.
kneedler,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
we
have
a
situation
right
now,
a
20th
century
situation
and
the
evidence
was
somewhat
resembling
what
is
going
on
in
iran
today
and
the
prisoners
said
they
observed
that
every
morning
they
were
taking
ten
prisoners
out
into
the
court
yard
and
executing
them,
just
broadside.
but
after
he
watched
that
for
ten
days
and
they
had
executed
a
hundred
prisoners
at
random,
he
decided
this
was
no
place
to
be
and
made
the
same
efforts
that
are
made
here.
and,
let
us
lay
aside
for
a
moment
whether
he
reported
to
anyone
regularly.
do
you
think
that
would
be
something
like
a
fire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
prison,
in
this
institution
is
any
limitation
on
the
right
of
the
inmates
to
write
to
their
congressman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
to
a
local
newspaper?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kohn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
defense
offered
was
the
defendant
said
he
heard
a
voice
commanding
him
to
leave
the
prison
and
to
go
and
carry
out
some
mission.
now,
short
of
a
claim
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
would
you
think
that
defense
must
be
heard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
posed
some
hypotheticals
in
other
state
holdings.
would
you
say
that
this
would
not
be
--
a
matter
that
the
judge
would
have
to
submit
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
he
argues
by
invitation
of
the
guards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
one
of
those
cases
he
came
back
within
a
few
hours
and
in
the
other
one
he
came
back
within
24
hours.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
is
gone
for
six
months?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fact
for
the
jury,
or
the
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
two
years,
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
because
we
have
rules
against
hearsay
doesn't
mean
that
those
events
think
the
jury
is
stupid
or
incompetent,
it
is
just
a
matter
of
rules
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
are
acquitted
for
the
20
or
30
or
60
days
that
they
are
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
i
have
the
impression
that
you
conceded
that
a
person
might
be
at
large
so
long
that
it
would
be
a
legal
question,
not
a
fact
question,
that
is
the
judge
may
decide
not
to
submit
it
to
a
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
must
be
saying
there
is
a
right
to
escape
under
certain
conditions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
else
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
a
prisoner
who
says
he
escaped
because
he
was
facing
certain
death
and
he
was
in
death
row
and
about
to
be
executed
next
monday?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
that
coercion
defense
would
be
available,
then,
under
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
the
finest
prison
in
the
world
--
the
finest
death
row
in
the
world
and
he
is
to
be
executed
next
monday.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
it
is
partly
because
the
threat
of
death
is
a
lawful
threat
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
which
due
process
has
brought
it
to
that
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
kohn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
--
excuse
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
