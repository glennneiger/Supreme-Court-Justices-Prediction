it
just
means
that
the
defense
isn't
good?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
require
that
you
prove
a
fair
opportunity
to
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
some
things
you
can
fail
to
do
and
lose
a
defense,
like
present
it
in
a
timely
manner,
like
an
alibi.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
is
different
in
this
case,
really,
if
a
judge
says,
"well,
we
have
a
defense
of
duress
but
only
here
are
the
elements,
one,
two,
three.
three
is
absent
no
defense
of
duress
evidence
is
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
was
it
or
not
was
it
a
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
an
escape
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
although
it
was
other
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
did
it
come
into
fashion
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
any
congressional
indictments
or
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
court
has
never
passed
on
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
goes
over
to
26-a.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
on
the
issue
of
duress,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
because
of
that
theory
but
if
we
should
agree
with
you
our
disposition
would
be
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
of
duress
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
right
or
wrong,
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
--
and
we
agreed
with
them
--
determined
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
of
duress
that
requires
ten
days
before
he
left,
and
things
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
my
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
the
only
reason
he
didn't
give
the
instructions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
instruction
would
not
have
been
required
unless
there
was
prima
facie
evidence
of
duress
and
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
decided
whether
or
not
there
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
you
can
say
it
isn't
a
constitutional
issue
at
all,
there
is
no
constitutional
issue,
it
is
just
a
definition
of
an
element
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
a
separate
crime
at
all?
