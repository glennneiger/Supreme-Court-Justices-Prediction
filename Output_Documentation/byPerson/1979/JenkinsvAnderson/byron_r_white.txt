r.

do
you
suggest
as
a
--
well,
you
certainly
don't
suggest
as
a
general
rule
of
evidence
that
silence
is
irrelevant.
let
us
assume
this
is
a
civil
case
and
in
the
face
of
accusations
you
remain
silent.
i
thought
the
normal
rule
of
evidence
was
that
silence
is
a
very
relevant
factor.
and
the
only
reason
that
silence
isn't
in
criminal
cases
is
just
to
the
extent
the
fifth
amendment
forbids
it,
wouldn't
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
isn't
because
there
is
any
duty
of
anybody
to
talk,
but
it
is
because
it
is
relevant
as
justice
stevens
suggests.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
about
the
extent
of
your
position
in
the
case.
you
don't
rely
at
all,
as
i
listened
to
your
argument,
on
the
doyle
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
is
what
you
were
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
misunderstood
you.
i
am
sorry.
