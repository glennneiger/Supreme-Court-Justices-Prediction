mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
bearing
in
mind
that
the
most
basic
tenet
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
not
incriminate
yourself
is
compulsion,
the
state
of
michigan
takes
a
position
that
in
this
cause
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
violation.
this
man
was
not
compelled
to
testify
against
himself.
the
contention
is
that
by
exploring
his
flight
and
concealment
that
his
"silence"
was
infringed
upon.
i
have
difficulty
in
conceiving
this
voluntary
flight
and
voluntary
concealment
to
be
in
the
category
of
silence,
certainly
not
in
a
testimonial
sense.
a
man
contends
that
once
he
exercises
his
sixth
amendment
right,
takes
the
stand
with
counsel
at
his
side
and
testifies
and
speaks
of
his
absence,
he
brought
it
all
on,
that
we
are
barred
from
cross-examining
on
that
issue.
incidentally,
of
the
30
or
more
pages
of
the
testimony
given
by
this
man,
less
than
a
page
i
think
--
it
is
less
than
a
page
in
the
appendix
concerning
the
examination
of
this
flight
and
concealment.
i
doubt
whether
it
had
any
serious
impact
upon
the
jury
at
all.
in
fact
keep
in
mind
that
this
man
was
charged
under
michigan
law
with
first
degree
murder,
conviction
of
which
requires
mandatory
life
sentence.
but
evidently
this
story
of
an
alibi
--
or
self
defense,
rather,
did
have
some
impact
upon
the
jury.
they
came
in
and
found
him
guilty
of
manslaughter,
which
is
a
10-
to
15-year
sentence
which
he
did
receive.
now,
it
is
not
doyle
case
at
all.
doyle
held
that
because
of
the
oppressive
conditions
of
the
police
station
and
the
features
thereof
that
you
couldn't
infringe
upon
that
and
make
mention
of
that.
but
here
in
this
case
he
brought
it
up.
there
was
no
compulsion,
no
fifth
amendment
problem
involved.
this
court
way
back
many
years
ago
i
think
in
raffel
said
that
once
the
accused
takes
the
stand
the
prosecution
has
full
sway
in
the
matter
of
issues
pertinent
to
the
cause
and
to
cross-examine
thereon.
i
move
along
a
bit
to
perhaps
a
knottier
problem
involved
here,
and
in
doyle
was
a
due
process
question.
the
question
is
whether
--
did
the
probative
value
of
examining
him
on
his
escape
and
concealment,
or
flight
and
concealment,
did
that
outweigh
the
prejudice
that
was
done
to
him.
i
would
have
to
say
"no,"
and
i
think
the
finding
of
a
lesser
--
guilt
of
a
lesser
offense
definitely
proves
that.
was
there
such
a
fundamental
unfairness
in
his
trial?
i
think
not.
oh,
the
prosecutor
made
the
rather
shall
i
say
tacky
remark
that
perhaps
during
his
flight
and
concealment
he
was
lining
up
witnesses.
i
think
he
also
referred
to
that
in
one
sentence
in
his
summation
to
the
jury.
but
you
know
that
is
not
all
bad,
it
is
a
perfectly
normal
thing
for
a
person.
he
has
explained
he
was
frightened.
that
is
another
explanation
for
his
flight
and
concealment.
and
perhaps
the
jury
did
believe
him,
that
he
was
frightened
and
that
if
the
reason
why
he
fled.
now,
it
would
certainly
be
a
most
normal
thing
--
i
would
certainly
not
take
exception
to
the
claim
that
any
intelligent
person
running
off
like
that
would
sure
try
and
line
up
some
witnesses.
that
would
be
the
intelligent
thing
and
not
necessarily
a
meretricious
act.
but
to
contend
that
a
person
may
involved
in
a
felony
and
go
on,
escape
for
more
than
two
weeks,
conceal
himself,
come
back
and
give
a
self
defense
plea
when
his
flight
and
concealment
was
certainly
in
consistent
with
such
a
plea,
to
permit
that
i
say
to
the
court
would
certainly
handcuff
prosecuting
authorities
throughout
this
country
in
many,
many
cases.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir,
and
they
made
their
selection.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
i
say
with
the
acceptance
of
a
theory
such
as
that
and
making
it
part
of
the
law
of
this
nation,
i
say
the
handcuffing
of
prosecuting
authorities
would
certainly
occur.
i
can
foresee
where
all
you
have
to
do
is
skip
out,
stay
concealed,
take
the
stand
with
some
plausible
self-defense
witnesses
and
you
could
not
be
--
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
oh,
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
constitutional
duty
of
that,
sir.
i
do
not.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
derengoski
no,
i
say
that
we
have
the
right
once
he
takes
the
stand
to
attempt
to
cast
doubt
upon
his
self
defense
plea
and
his
escape
and
concealment
is
certainly
an
act
inconsistent
--
and
that
has
been
generally
held
--
with
a
plea
of
self
defense.
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
conclude.
