did
the
lower
court
hold
there
was
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
do
any
of
these
things?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
failure
to
do
them
if
brought
out
on
cross-examination
may
undermine
his
credibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
necessarily.
i
think
he
could
have
said
and
the
trial
judge
could
have
told
the
jury
he
had
no
duty
to
go
in
and
talk
and
you
should
decide
for
yourselves
whether
there
is
any
inconsistency
between
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
necessarily
say
there
was
a
duty.
the
question
is
one
of
credibility
ultimately,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
right
but
he
wasn't
summoned
before
the
police
and
didn't
assert
any
such
right.
he
just
didn't
volunteer
to
go
to
the
police.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
silence
in
civil
cases
a
perfectly
relevant
matter
to
be
brought
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
doyle
was
due
process,
wasn't
it?
i
thought
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
your
view
--
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
theory
--
is
it
your
view
that
anytime
a
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent
and
does
so,
notwithstanding
how
relevant
that
silence
may
be
to
the
some
issue
in
the
case
the
prosecutor
may
never
bring
out
the
fact
of
silence
because
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
maintain
his
silence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
long
as
his
speaking
might
incriminate
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
right
and
you
would
qualify
your
statement,
you
are
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
protection
against
self-incrimination,
that
entails
self-incrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it
would
just
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
if
you
added
to
the
miranda
warnings,
you
tell
him
you
have
a
right
to
remain
silent
and
the
right
to
a
lawyer
and
so
on;
but
that
if
you
remain
silent
your
silence
may
be
used
against
you.
now,
let
us
assume
he
is
warned
to
that
effect.
you
would
say
even
so,
you
couldn't
use
his
silence
to
impeach
him
at
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ziemba,
supposing
that
your
defendant,
your
client
got
on
the
witness
stand
and
testified
that
immediately
after
killing
he
went
to
the
police
chief
and
told
him
it
was
self
defense
and
what
happened
and
he
is
in
fact
had
been
silent
and
had
not
gone
to
the
police
chief.
couldn't
the
police
chief
get
on
the
stand
and
say
"this
man
remained
silent."
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that
is
what
the
theory
of
the
state
is
here,
that
he
got
on
the
stand
and
told
a
deliberate
falsehood,
it
is
inconsistent
with
his
silence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
disagree
with
it,
but
that
is
their
theory.
