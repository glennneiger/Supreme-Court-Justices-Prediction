mr.
carl
ziemba
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
there
is
one
major
shortcoming
in
the
administration
of
criminal
law
in
this
country
it
is
in
the
restricted
interpretation
given
to
the
concept
of
the
presumption
of
innocence.
in
my
years
at
the
criminal
trial
bar
i
have
so
often
heard
trial
judges
instruct
the
jury
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
and
that
the
presumption
starts
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
and
continues
on
until
his
guilt
is
proven
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
i
think
that
that
is
a
misleading,
if
not
mistaken,
notion
of
the
presumption
of
innocence.
i
think
that
we
are
all
as
members
of
this
society
presumed
to
be
innocent
of
the
commission
of
crime.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
but
i
think
that
that
is
a
restricted
concept
of
it.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
agree
with
the
court's
declaration
so
far
as
the
court
went.
but
i
would
say
that
the
reason
why
a
police
officer
has
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
somebody
has
committed
a
felony
or
to
see
the
person
commit
a
misdemeanor
in
his
presence
before
he
can
lay
hold
of
him
is
because
that
person
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
of
the
commission
of
crime.
i
think
that
the
very
genious
of
our
system
of
criminal
jurisprudence
starts
with
the
presumption
of
innocence
which
invests
every
member
of
our
society
and
it
must
follow
from
that
in
our
system
of
jurisprudence,
criminal
jurisprudence
that
if
a
person
is
presumed
innocent
he
cannot
be
burdened
with
the
duty
of
proving
his
innocence.
and
therefore
if
the
state
accuses
a
person
of
crime
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
crime.
and
then
of
course
they
have
evolved
all
of
the
facets
of
the
principle
of
the
right
of
nonincrimination
investing
every
individual,
which
means
to
say
that
if
the
state
chooses
to
charge
a
person
with
crime
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
charge
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
without
any
assistance
at
all
from
the
defendant.
and
there
is
no
burden
upon
the
defendant
to
make
an
explanation
or
to
make
exonerating
statements.
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is
true,
but
we
have
said
that
that
is
not
testimonial
in
nature,
have
we
not.
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
i
suppose
not.
of
course
that
is
not
to
say
that
i
am
in
absolute
agreement
with
the
concept
that
giving
blood
samples
and
things
of
this
nature
is
not
compelling
a
person
to
give
evidence
against
himself.
but
of
course
i
am
in
the
minority
on
that
point
of
view.
but
we
do
recognize
the
fundamental
principle
that
when
one
is
hailed
into
court
and
put
on
trial
and
all
of
the
state's
evidence
marshaled
against
him
is
presented
in
court
he
still
has
the
right
to
remain
silent.
and
nobody
can
comment
upon
that,
upon
the
fact
that
he
did
remain
silent.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
it
does
but
we
cannot
--
we
cannot
punish
a
person
for
exercising
a
constitutional
right
simply
because
he
exercises
another
right,
and
that
is
the
right
to
give
evidence
under
the
sixth
amendment.
in
other
words,
here
we
have
--
we
have
the
potential
of
a
person
reading
in
the
newspaper
that
the
authorities
suspect
him
of
the
commission
of
some
crime
though
there
is
no
formal
charge
made
against
him
but
still
it
is
brought
about
that
x
done
so
and
so.
now,
x
must
decide
instantaneously
then
before
any
charge
is
formally
filed
against
him
whether
he
is
going
to
testify
in
his
trial
if
it
should
ever
come
to
that,
you
see.
because
if
he
intends
to
testify
in
his
trial
he
had
better
come
out
with
an
explanation
in
the
face
of
these
rumors
and
the
stories
in
the
newspapers
now.
otherwise,
he
is
going
to
be
damned
on
trial
by
his
pre-trial
silence
in
the
face
of
these
accusations.
i
do
not
think
that
supports
our
basic
tenets
and
principles
of
fairness
and
justice.
now,
if
it
is
true
that
it
is
true
that
a
person
who
stopped
on
a
street
by
a
police
officer
and
is
asked
question
about
the
commission
of
some
crime
has
a
perfect
right
not
to
answer
the
police
officer,
then
how
can
we
say
that
any
duty
devolves
upon
that
person
when
he
hears
that
he
might
be
charged
with
crime
or
that
he
is
suspected
of
a
commission
of
crime
has
a
duty
to
seek
out
the
police,
go
down
to
the
police
station,
stop
the
police
officer
on
the
street
in
a
scout
car
and
say
"one
moment,
please.
you
have
got
to
go
along.
i
acted
in
self
defense
or,
"it
was
an
accident,"
or
"i
wasn't
there,"
or
whatever
the
case
might
be.
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
but
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
it
doesn't
have
to
imply
that
one
has
the
duty.
mr.
carl
ziemba
but
isn't
it
a
matter
of
credibility
if
a
person
is
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury
and
he
claims
his
right
under
the
fifth?
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
think
it
is
an
awfully
strange
doctrine
that
says
that
if
a
person
is
hailed
before
a
grand
jury
he
may
exercise
with
impunity
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent.
if
he
is
hailed
before
congress
or
any
investigatory
body
and
he
is
propounded
questions,
he
may
exercise
the
fifth
amendment
to
remain
silent.
if
he
is
placed
under
arrest
whether
he
is
given
his
warnings
or
not
he
has
the
absolute
right
to
refuse
to
answer
questions.
if
he
is
stopped
on
the
street
he
has
the
absolute
right
under
the
fifth
amendment
not
to
answer
any
questions.
and
still
we
say
that
if
a
person
is
sitting
in
his
living
room
and
he
hears
on
television
that
he
has
been
accused
of
crime,
that
there
is
a
warrant
out
for
his
arrest,
before
he
is
arrested
he
must
answer
the
telephone,
go
down
to
the
police
station
and
make
protestations
of
innocence.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
in
civil
cases
we
are
dealing
with
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
but
in
civil
cases
we
are
dealing
with
such
inconsequential
things
as
money
and
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
that
may
be
mr.
justice
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
right.
and
further
that
the
fifth
amendment
extends
out
into
the
community
in
all
circumstances.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan
would
probably
decide
the
case
on
the
face
--
on
the
basis
of
people
v.
bobo
cited
on
page
26
of
the
petitioner'
brief
where
the
court
said."
whether
his
(defendant's)
silence
was
prior
to
or
at
the
time
of
arrest
makes
little
difference
--
the
defendant's
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent
is
constant."
"if
silence
in
the
face
of
specific
accusation
'may
not
be
used'
(against
the
defendant),
it
would
be
a
strange
doctrine
indeed
that
would
permit
silence
absent
such
an
accusation
to
be
used
as
evidence
of
guilt."
mr.
carl
ziemba
mr.
justice
white,
i
keep
asking
that
question
time
and
time
again.
my
practice
in
the
state
of
michigan
is
almost
exclusively
criminal
work
and
i
cannot
answer
these
questions,
why
in
a
certain
case
the
court
will
invoke
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
michigan
and
reverse
a
conviction
and
in
other
case
--
well,
i
can't
discern
any
fact
the
difference
the
court
gives
me
an
unpublished
opinion
in
which
they
say
"we
examined
the
record
and
find
no
error."
i
have
no
explanation
for
it,
for
that
phenomenon
i
am
sorry.
but
let
us
imagine
two
persons
engaged
in
an
activity
and
the
police
surprise
them
and
one
is
seized
and
the
other
runs
and
makes
good
his
escape.
the
one
who
is
seized
is
immediately
told
by
the
police
"now,
you
have
the
right
under
the
constitution
not
to
say
anything."
he
is
given
his
miranda
rights.
and
the
second
culprit
has
remained
at
liberty
for
two
weeks,
he
hasn't
come
forth
with
any
explanation
or
he
hasn't
stopped
in
a
police
office,
he
hasn't
gone
into
any
police
station.
but
eventually
he
is
taken
into
custody
and
both
placed
on
trial.
the
chap
who
had
the
misfortune
or
good
fortune
to
be
arrested
at
the
scene
and
given
his
miranda
warnings,
he
can
risk
complete
impunity,
take
the
witness
stand
and
give
exculpatory
evidence
without
being
damned
for
exercising
his
right
to
silence.
the
fellow
who
was
at
liberty
for
two
weeks,
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
he
is
impeached,
he
is
shown
to
be
lying
on
trial
because
he
remained
silent
in
those
two
weeks
he
is
at
liberty
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
carl
ziemba
in
the
--
petitioner
here
had
court-appointed
counsel
on
his
appeal
as
a
right
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
and
the
specific
issue
before
the
court
today
was
not
raised
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
in
appointed
counsel's
brief.
you
see
we
have
in
the
state
of
michigan
a
procedural
device
available
to
the
prosecution
wherein
the
prosecution
can
file
a
motion
to
affirm
the
conviction
on
the
basis
that
the
issues
raised
by
the
appellant
are
so
unsubstantial
as
not
to
need
any
form
of
submission
in
argument.
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
prosecutor
an
order
affirming
the
conviction
might
enter.
and
that
was
done
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
of
michigan
entered
an
order
affirming
the
conviction
on
the
basis
of
a
motion
to
affirm
by
the
prosecutor.
then
the
petitioner
here
being
dissatisfied
with
his
appointed
counsel's
brief,
filed
a
motion
for
reconsideration
--
an
application
for
reconsideration
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
within
the
time
allocated
by
the
rules.
and
he
raised
this
specific
issue
and
the
application
for
reconsideration
was
denied.
the
petitioner
then
proceeded
pro
se
to
make
application
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
a
discretionary
appeal
and
he
presented
this
issue
before
the
court,
among
others,
to
make
michigan
court
--
michigan
supreme
court.
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
denied
leave
to
appeal,
stating
that
they
are
not
persuaded
that
the
questions
should
be
reviewed
by
the
court.
now,
i
might
point
this
out
that
the
state
of
michigan
neither
in
the
court
of
appeals
nor
in
the
michigan
supreme
court
nor
in
the
federal
supreme
court
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
nor
on
the
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
raised
the
issue
that
there
was
failure
to
make
a
contemporaneous
objection
at
trial.
in
other
words,
that
issue
has
never
been
raised
in
this
case
until
it
has
come
here
under
petition
for
certiorari.
and
i
think
that
if
the
defendant
is
chargeable
for
neglecting
to
object
on
the
--
on
trial,
the
state
of
michigan
is
chargeable
for
not
raising
that
objection
any
place
during
the
appellate
procedures
and
processes
until
it
has
come
before
this
court.
and
i
might
point
this
out
further,
your
honor,
that
in
the
state
of
michigan
we
do
have
a
plain
error
doctrine
and
it
is
invoked
most
frequently
when
constitutional
rights
are
involved.
so
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and/or
the
michigan
supreme
court
could
have
--
could
have
entertained
this
question
and
reversed
the
conviction
even
in
the
absence
of
an
objection
by
the
petitioner
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
carl
ziemba
they
did
not;
no.
so
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
should
not
be
considered
to
be
an
issue
before
this
court.
now,
your
honor,
i
have
never
--
i
have
never
killed
an
individual
to
my
knowledge,
but
i
would
guess
--
i
would
guess
that
any
kind
of
a
killing
of
an
individual
must
be
an
emotionally
disturbing
thing.
and
i
know
this
from
my
practice
in
the
criminal
law
in
the
city
of
detroit
that
a
young
black
person
who
is
involved
in
a
homicide
is
not
going
to
be
terribly
anxious
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police
officer.
he
is
going
to
be
frightened.
it
is
natural
reaction
for
any
individual.
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
the
case
mr.
justice.
here
we
have
a
black
petitioner.
he
argued
that
he
was
frightened.
he
was
so
frightened
of
the
police
that
before
he
turned
himself
in
he
made
arrangements
with
the
black
mayor
of
the
city
of
detroit
to
surrender
himself
through
the
mayor's
office
because
he
was
afraid.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
am
not
sure.
he
--
he
might
have
had,
your
honor
not
a
serious
one.
mr.
carl
ziemba
he
had
no
--
no,
no,
in
point
of
fact
i
recall,
your
honor,
he
gave
the
explanation
that
he
was
--
that
he
was
in
addition
fearful
that
because
he
had
been
placed
on
probation
just
recently
by
one
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
the
city
of
detroit.
so,
he
did
have
--
he
did
have
a
prior
criminal
record.
but
of
course
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
when
an
unschooled
individual
goes
through
a
criminal
proceeding
--
a
case
on
the
time
that
he
is
necessarily
thoroughly
educated,
given
the
--
in
the
principles
and
processes
of
the
criminal
law.
i
don't
think
that
that
person
can
then
be
judged
to
-
to
one
who
is
familiar
with
the
criminal
law
and
the
criminal
processes.
so
that
the
--
the
jury
in
this
case
in
point
of
fact
the
petitioner
was
tried
with
murder
of
the
first
degree.
the
jury
took
four
and
half
days
--
four
and
a
half
days
to
come
back
with
a
verdict
of
manslaughter.
in
the
state
of
michigan
we
have
murder
of
the
first
degree,
second
degree
and
then
voluntary
manslaughter.
now,
it
was
the
defendant's
testimony
which
was
crucial
to
this
case.
he
asserted
a
defense
of
self
defense.
he
said
that
he
stabbed
in
self
defense.
now,
if
his
--
his
impeachment
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
form
that
we
find
in
this
case
seriously
undermined
his
credibility
in
the
eyes
of
the
--
of
the
lay
juries,
and
that
is
where
the
basic
unfairness
and
the
violation
of
the
constitution
principle
is
involved.
are
there
any
further
questions?
mr.
carl
ziemba
there
were
no
objections
to
the
arguments
of
the
prosecutor
referring
to
the
exercise
by
the
petitioner
of
his
right
to
silence;
there
was
not,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
that
was
a
fair
representation,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
think
--
well,
no,
i
think
--
no,
my
experience
is
that
the
jury
wants
to
hear
from
the
defendant,
what's
his
side
of
the
story.
and
it
is
very
important
i
think
in
a
criminal
case
to
put
the
defendant
on
the
stand.
if
i
can
possibly
put
the
defendant
on
the
stand
i
will
put
him
on
the
stand
because
the
--
the
--
the
chances
of
relief
without
giving
the
defendant
the
stand
are
materially
reduced,
you
see.
now,
the
defendant
gets
on
the
stand
and
he
swears,
you
see,
that
the
deceased
had
the
knife
and
that
the
deceased
was
coming
at
the
petitioner
because
the
petitioner
had
reported
that
the
deceased
had
committed
this
crime
a
few
days
earlier.
and
that
he
wrestled
with
the
petitioner
and
he
turned
--
tussled
and
wrestled
with
the
deceased
and
turned
the
knife
of
the
deceased
on
the
deceased
and
stabbed
him
with
his
own
knife,
you
see.
now,
it
is
my
impression
--
it
is
my
impression
that
--
that
jurists
come
to
jury
service
invested
with
the
fork
wisdom.
for
instance,
you
can
stack
the
jury
until
the
cows
come
home,
that
a
defendant
need
not
prove
his
alibi.
that
is
the
law
in
the
state
of
michigan,
that
it
is
sufficient
if
the
evidence
on
alibi
raises
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
presence
of
the
defendant
of
the
scene
of
the
crime
that
is
committed.
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
fact
of
jury
trials
that
if
the
jury
believes
that
the
alibi
witnesses
are
lying,
they
will
say
"uh,
he
must
be
guilty,
because
they
are
lying."
you
see.
and
so
they
also
come
--
they
also
come
to
a
jury
trial
with
the
preconception
that
if
a
defendant
has
nothing
to
fear,
he
is
not
guilty,
why
doesn't
he
get
up
on
that
witness
stand
and
say
so.
why
doesn't
he
get
up
there
and
deny
his
guilt,
you
see.
and
then
when
the
defendant
gets
on
the
witness
stand
and
the
prosecutor
says
"you
can't
believe
him,
you
can't
believe
him
because
if
what
he
was
telling
you
in
court
today
is
true
he
would
have
come
voluntarily
into
the
police
department
soon
after
that
onslaught
as
he
possibly
as
he
possibly
could
get
and
explain
'you
have
got
it
all
wrong,
i
acted
in
self
defense,'"
you
see.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
do
to
this
extent,
that
the
doyle
case
is
correct
but
the
doyle
case
seems
to
say
that
the
police
invent
constitutional
rights
when
they
inform
a
defendant
of
the
miranda
rights.
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
i
am
sure
the
fifth
amendment
is
in
there
some
place.
the
court
said
you
can't
tell
the
man
that
he
has
a
right
under
the
fifth
amendment
not
to
incriminate
himself
and
then
on
trial
damn
him
because
he
exercised
his
right.
this
is
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
i
would
say
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
certainly.
miranda
didn't
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
but
i
would
say
this,
that
miranda
didn't
invent
any
new
constitutional
right.
mr.
carl
ziemba
you
see.
all
miranda
says
was
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
all
that
miranda
says
is,
"look,
will
you
please
take
a
person
into
custody,
inform
him
of
the
fact
that
he
has
a
right
to
remain
silent
because
otherwise
he
may
not
know
and
he
may
be
frightened
into
making
a
statement,"
you
see.
but
if
a
person
is
taken
into
custody
and
he
is
a
constitutional
scholar
and
he
remains
silent
even
and
is
not
given
his
miranda
rights,
why
do
we
shore
him
of
his
right
to
remain
silent,
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
rights?
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
carl
ziemba
precisely,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
respectfully
submit
that
if
a
person
is
--
has
the
right
to
remain
silent,
then
there
is
no
duty
ever
imposed
upon
him
to
speak.
his
silence
can
never
be
inconsistent
with
innocence.
after
all
we
say
that
a
person
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
in
this
case
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is
the
basic
underlying
--
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is
true.
if
a
person
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
and
if
a
person
has
a
right
to
remain
silent,
then
how
can
we
ever
say
that
he
has
a
duty
under
any
circumstances
in
the
face
of
rumors
or
accusations
of
crime
to
come
forward
and
give
explanations
under
penalty
that
if
he
should
be
placed
on
trial
for
criminal
charges
and
he
gets
up
on
the
witness
stand
he
will
be
damned
for
the
exercise
of
his
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent?
mr.
carl
ziemba
why
should
he
have
to
do
that,
mr.
chief
justice?
anybody
--
if
he
is
exercising
a
constitutional
right
why
should
he
have
to
give
anybody
an
explanation
as
to
why
he
exercised
that
constitutional
right?
what
is
the
result
of
the
constitutional
right
if
he
has
to
go
around
explaining
why
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
the
prosecutor
certainly
was.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
am
sorry,
but
i
cannot
see
any
difference
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
--
in
saying
that
and
saying
you
had
a
duty.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
its
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
if
the
case
is
laying
down
a
rule
like
that,
i
would
just
throw
up
my
hands
and
say
i
just
don't
understand
the
law
--
i
just
don't
understand
the
law.
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
that's
--
then
he
has
gotten
on
the
witness
stand
and
told
a
deliberate
falsehood.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no.
mr.
carl
ziemba
you
see
the
ultimate
question
for
the
jury
to
decide
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
telling
the
truth
or
not,
you
see.
it
is
not
for
the
prosecutor.
do
i
sit
down?
mr.
carl
ziemba
thank
you.
mr.
solicitor
general.
