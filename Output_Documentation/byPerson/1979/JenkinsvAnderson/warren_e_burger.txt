chief
justice

we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
the
jenkins
v.
anderson.
mr.
ziemba.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
once
he
takes
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf
the
situation
undergoes
some
change,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
little
more
than
that,
isn't
it,
counsel;
he
just
didn't
remain
silent,
he
fled
from
the
scene
of
a
homicide
situation
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
a
man
was
stabbed
to
death.
the
man
remained
without
communication
for
two
weeks.
that
kind
of
silence
is
a
little
different
from
just
remaining
silent
after
you
have
got
a
miranda
warning,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
make
so
much
importance,
you
have
devoted
10
minutes
or
12
minutes
to.
did
trial
counsel
make
an
objection
at
the
time
this
issue
arose
in
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
raised
in
the
first
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
have
a
prior
criminal
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
is
some
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
not
wholly
unfamiliar
with
the
criminal
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
notice
from
the
record
that
there
apparently
was
no
objection
to
the
prosecutor's
references
to
his
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
that
this
--
at
least
i
got
the
impression
you
said
this
case
turned
entirely
on
his
testimony.
the
jury
had
the
choice
of
believing
eye
witnesses
brought
by
the
prosecution
and
eye
witnesses
produced
by
the
defendants
and
these
witnesses
were
in
conflict
with
each
other,
were
they
not,
as
to
who
had
the
knife
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
jury
verdict
came
down
to
whether
they
were
going
to
believe
one
set
of
witnesses
or
believe
another
set
of
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
necessarily.
he
may
give
quite
a
good
explanation
that
satisfies
the
jury
as
to
why
he
waited
two
weeks
before
he
moved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whether
it
was
inconsistent
with
his
plea
or
not
was
a
matter
for
the
jury
to
decide.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
suggest
that
they
were
influenced
to
the
extent
that
they
reduced
this
by
two
grades,
from
first
degree
murder
down
to
manslaughter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
