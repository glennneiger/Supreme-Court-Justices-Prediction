justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
say
that
bell
v.
wolfish
last
year
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
was
something
a
word
of
art
peculiar
to
criminal
trials?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
disagree
with
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
defendant
can
be
called
before
a
grand
jury
and
required
to
give
blood
samples,
handwriting
analysis,
and
that
sort
of
thing;
can
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
take
it
the
state
wouldn't
do
it
if
it
didn't
feel
it
was
helping
prove
its
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
ziemba,
to
take
the
last
hypothesis
that
you
proposed
of
someone
sitting
in
his
living
room
and
hearing
a
radio
broadcast
that
there
had
been
a
crime
committed
and
perhaps
he
was
a
suspect
and
he
was
ultimately
indicted
and
tried,
took
the
stand
and
the
prosecutor
sought
to
impeach
him
because
he
had
failed
to
rush
down
to
the
police
station
and
give
his
version.
don't
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
would
have
decided
this
question
on
a
non-constitutional
ground
just
that
it
is
not
relevant
it
doesn't
impeach
the
man's
credibility
for
him
to
have
failed
to
rush
down
to
the
police
station?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
did
the
--
your
client
have
to
go
to
the
federal
courts
to
get
relief
here
if
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
feels
that
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
didn't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nobody
is
saying
he
had
to
do
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
the
prosecutor
was
saying
was
that
the
fact
that
he
didn't
do
it
is
relevant
in
an
evidentiary
sense
in
deciding
whether
or
not
he
was
telling
the
truth
at
the
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
really.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
regret
my
illogic.
