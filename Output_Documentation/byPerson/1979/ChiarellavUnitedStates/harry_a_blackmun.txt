justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
your
opinion,
was
it
criminal
under
state
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
feel
fairly
certain
about
that
in
new
york?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
arkin,
supposing
the
tender
offeror
here
had
been
the
issuer,
you
could
have
an
issuer
wanting
to
buy
up
a
block
of
its
own
stock,
would
your
case
be
different?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
no.
i
am
saying
he
is
still
a
printer.
he
is
still
a
printer,
not
an
insider.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
tippees
there
got
it
directly,
didn't
they,
from
the
directors
or
officers?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
other
words,
are
you
conceding
--
let
me
be
sure
i
don't
lose
this
--
are
you
conceding
that
he
would
be
liable
if
the
client
of
the
print
shop
had
been
the
issuer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
does
the
wrongfulness
of
his
conduct
or
the
language
of
the
statute
draw
any
distinction
at
all
between
the
kind
of
customer
of
the
print
shop?
it
is
kind
of
a
strange
distinction.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
in
that
case
the
seller
of
the
stock
from
whom
he
buys
could
recover
damages
from
him
under
10(b)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
am
not
asking
you
how
much.
i
would
just
like
to
ask
you
whether
a
legal
duty
to
the
seller
of
the
stock
has
been
breached.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
under
10(b)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
10(b)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
does
it
have
to
be
misappropriated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
it
is
just
confidential?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
this
printer
had
gone
out
and
just
told
everybody
what
he
knew,
he
didn't
go
out
and
misappropriate
it
in
the
sense
that
he
profited
by
it,
he
just
went
out
and
blabbed
it
all
over
town
and
a
lot
of
other
people
started
buying
shares.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
he
did
spread
around
confidential
information.
that
is
not
enough?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
just
a
wrong
to
the
sellers
alone
would
not
violate
10(b)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
non-disclosure
to
the
sellers
wouldn't
violate
10(b)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
unless
you
went
on
and
showed
that
the
information
was
wrongfully
obtained
and
being
wrongfully
used.
