mr.
arkin,
why
isn't
the
case
apposite?
you
just
said
it
wasn't,
but
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
reasoning
why
the
case
wasn't
apposite.
why
isn't
that
case
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
trespass
itself
was
a
tort
against
the
seller?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
one
of
the
officers
of
the
corporation
seeking
to
make
the
tender
offer
individually
for
his
own
account
went
and
bought
up
some
of
the
stock
ahead
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
made
a
profit,
perhaps
his
own
company
could
recover
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
about
the
selling
stockholder?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
fails
to
disclose
to
them
that
there
is
about
to
be
a
tender
offer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
would
be
true
even
though
the
tendering
company
itself
may
buy
a
limited
amount
of
stock
without
disclosing
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
just
throw
one
question
at
you
that
you
could
handle
before
you
get
--
suppose
that
--
one
can
argue
that
it
was
the
seller
who
was
defrauded
or
one
can
argue
that
it
was
the
tender
offeror
who
was
defrauded,
either
way.
assume
you
had
an
action
in
which
the
defendant
came
in
and
said
i
know
i
cheated
somebody,
i
will
pay
the
money
into
the
court
and
you
two
fight
it
out
as
to
who
is
entitled
to
this
money.
who
would
get
it,
that
is,
as
between
the
tender
offeror
and
the
people
who
sold
to
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
assuming
there
has
got
to
be
a
choice,
you
say
the
investor
would
get
it
even
though
the
tender
offerors
could
have
made
precisely
the
same
transaction
with
the
investor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
could
have
separately
--
say
he
doesn't
have
up
to
5
percent,
he
could
have
gone
to
the
sellers
and
said
i
will
buy
this
amount
of
stock
at
this
very
same
price
that
this
person
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
information
he
is
about
to
make
a
tender
offer
isn't
publicly
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
the
epitome
of
inside
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
he
didn't
have
legal
duty
to
the
seller
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
if
he
breached
no
duty
to
the
sellers,
he
did
breach
a
duty
to
the
offerors
in
connection
with
his
purchase
of
the
securities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
as
far
as
you
need
to
go?
