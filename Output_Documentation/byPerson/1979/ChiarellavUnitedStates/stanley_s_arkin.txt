mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
it
concerns
the
scope
of
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
securities
exchange
act
and,
more
particularly,
whether
it
is
a
violation,
a
criminal
violation
of
that
statute
for
a
purchaser
of
stock
who
is
not
an
"insider"
and
had
no
fiduciary
relation
to
a
prospective
seller
to
purchase
that
stock
without
revealing
that
he
had
obtained
information
from
a
source
thoroughly
outside
the
issuer
corporation,
that
is,
not
inside
information
but
outside
information
created
by
the
outside
source.
mr.
chiarella,
the
petitioner,
was
employed
in
1975
and
1976
as
a
mark-up
man
in
pandick
press,
which
is
a
financial
printing
house
in
downtown
new
york,
and
while
there
he
came
upon
and
in
possession
of
information
from
customers
of
pandick
with
respect
to
their
intention
to
tender
through
other
corporations,
and
using
that
information
which
he
obtained
from
the
customers
in
his
capacity
as
a
mark-up
man,
he
went
into
the
open
market
and
he
purchased
shares
of
stock
in
the
target
corporations.
he
didn't
tell
anyone
he
was
doing
that;
he
just
did
it.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
he
had
any
relationship
with
the
seller
of
the
shares,
which
would
have
mandated
that
he
make
a
disclosure,
or
whether
pure
nondisclosure
where
there
is
no
fiduciary
or
other
special
relationship
amounts
to
a
violation
of
10(b).
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
i
would
agree
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
author
and
the
printer,
who
is
an
agent
of
his
principal,
the
printer,
but
there
the
remedy
would
not
be
something
which
is
analogous
to
section
10(b).
it
would
be
a
state
remedy
which
i
think
would
be
most
appropriate
here.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no
special
relationship
between
the
seller
of
the
stock
in
the
open
market
and
the
printer.
there
is
a
relationship
of
sorts,
special,
between
mr.
chiarella
here,
the
printer,
and
the
customers
of
pandick.
but
that
is
not
at
issue,
i
say,
here,
though
i
will
deal
with
that
in
a
moment,
because
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
suggest
it
may
have
some
point.
the
statute
prohibits
the
employment
of
any
deceptive
or
manipulative
device
or
contrivance
in
violation
of
particular
rules
which
are
promulgated
by
the
sec.
simply
put,
there
has
been
no
deception,
no
manipulation
here
within
that
statute.
this
is
a
case
of
no
more
than
a
breach,
if
you
will,
of
some
kind
of
state
fiduciary
duty
which
mr.
chiarella
may
have
owed
the
customers
of
pandick.
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
this
particular
litigation,
you
will
see
a
remarkable
effort
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
and
then
the
circuit
court
and
now
the
solicitor
general
to
formulate
an
entirely
new
theory
of
relationship
in
order
to
impose
10(b)
liability
on
mr.
chiarella.
in
the
district
court
you
had
a
simple,
straightforward
classic
insider
analysis
used.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no,
the
only
rule
that
congress
has
ever
enacted,
justice
rehnquist,
which
deals
with
insiders,
insofar
as
trading,
is
rule
16(b),
which
mandates
that
an
insider,
which
is
defined
in
the
statute
as
an
officer
or
director
or
majority
--
not
majority,
but
control
shareholder
--
of
a
corporation
is
proscribed
from
trading,
purchasing
or
selling,
or
selling
or
purchasing
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no,
he
was
not.
he
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
section
10(b).
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
well,
as
i
think
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
the
case
law
also
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
from
the
second
circuit,
yes.
i
would
say
that
in
this
particular
case,
assuming
that
texas
gulf
sulphur
and
its
progeny,
or
cady,
roberts
and
its
progeny
are
correct,
that
it
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
because
my
client
did
not
have
any
statutory
or
common
law
fiduciary
duty
to
any
of
the
shareholders
in
the
corporation
the
stock
of
which
he
purchased.
so
it
does
make
a
difference
for
that
reason.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
indeed
a
second
circuit
case.
it
was
the
landmark
case
as
of
that
time
when
insider
trade
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
in
the
second
circuit,
in
that
circuit
alone.
but
if
you
look
at
what
took
place
in
the
trial
court,
the
imposition
of
the
classic
insider
duty
and
it
was
sorely
inappropriate
and
it
was
imposed
on
the
theory
that
he
had
no
legitimate
business
purpose
in
his
trade,
that
is,
chiarella
didn't,
whereas
the
tender
offer
corporations
whom
he
sought
to
identify
himself
with
had
some
legitimate
economic
purpose.
interestingly,
this
theory
was
rejected
at
the
circuit
level
and
an
entirely
new
effort
to
push
this
conduct
into
10(b)
was
formulated
which
has
been
referred
to
as
the
market
insider
rule,
that
is,
the
second
circuit
rule
that
since
mr.
chiarella
was
employed
in
a
printing
house
which
had
access
to
financial
information
on
a
regular
basis,
that
that
regular
receipt
of
information
somehow
put
him
into
a
particular
category
of
status
requiring
him
to
disclose
or
abstain,
as
the
case
may
be,
and
of
course
somebody
in
that
position
would
really,
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct,
have
a
duty
to
abstain,
and
disclosure
would
not
be
something
which
would
be
relevant
or
work
at
all.
that
particular
test
formulated
by
the
second
circuit
was
entirely
new,
expansive,
novel
approach
to
section
10(b),
was
rejected
in
a
footnote
by
the
solicitor
on
the
ground
that
it
was
insufficiently
discreet,
that
is,
that
rule
would
encompass
the
activities
of
market
professionals
and
others
who
perform
a
worthy
market
function
and
that
accordingly
that
rule
wouldn't
obtain,
and
an
entirely
new
rule
or
rules,
again
an
effort
to
push
this
conduct
into
a
particular
box,
was
formulated.
the
theory
which
the
solicitor
general
now
advances
in
its
effort
to
demonstrate
some
relationship
chiarella
had
is
that
by
somehow
reaching
a
duty,
committing
some
kind
of
tort,
vis-a-vis
the
tender
offeror,
the
customer
of
pandick,
that
that,
as
if
it
were
a
contagious
disease,
was
carried
over
into
the
transaction
between
mr.
chiarella
and
the
purchaser
on
the
open
market;
and
then,
secondly,
on
the
other
hand
that
somehow
mr.
chiarella
by
virtue
of
having
this
superior
information
which
he
obtained
in
a
--
and
i
am
quoting
the
solicitor
general
--
"a
tortuous
manner,"
that
that
itself
created
a
direct
duty
by
mr.
chiarella
to
the
purchaser.
neither
one
of
those
theories
wash.
neither
one
of
them
should
stand
up
to
analysis.
they
simply
totally
obviate
prior
law
under
section
10(b)
and
the
common
law.
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
relevance
as
to
whether
mr.
chiarella
did
anything
to
the
tender
offeror,
the
customer,
of
course
that
wasn't
charged
in
this
case.
the
case
was
not
indicted
that
way,
it
wasn't
tried
on
that
theory,
it
wasn't
charged
to
the
jury
on
that
theory,
so
that
is
an
entirely
novel
and
new
approach.
but
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
is
not
in
the
case
except
at
the
appellate
level,
really,
there
would
have
been
no
duty
of
chiarella
here
because
it
is
a
tender
--
not
the
tender
offeror,
it
is
the
customer,
the
seller
of
the
stock
which
10(b)
is
directed
at,
aimed
at,
and
there
was
no
relationship
of
chiarella
to
that
person.
and
so
what
happened
vis-a-vis
the
tender
offeror
we
say
is
not
relevant
at
all.
moreover,
there
was
really
no
fraud
there.
at
most,
i
think
you
could
say
there
was
an
unauthorized
use
of
information
and
i
would
suggest
that
not
all
fiducial
breaches,
not
all
unauthorized
conduct
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
well,
not
very
appealing
but
that
is
most
respectfully,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
hardly
a
standard
to
bring
within
a
statute
enacted
by
congress.
no,
it
was
not
but
it
was
a
kind
of
conduct
which
should
appropriately
be
dealt
with
by
the
state
with
a
vast
body
of
state
law.
he
could
have
been
sued
in
conversion,
he
could
have
been
fired,
as
it
was,
sued
for
breach
of
contract,
or
possibly
sued
under
a
theory
of
unlawful
acquisition
of
a
corporate
opportunity.
but
it
certainly
wasn't
within
10(b)
and,
of
course,
not
all
unappealing
conduct
or
undesirable
conduct
is
within
the
common
law
or
statutory
meanings
of
fraud
or
manipulation.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
mr.
justice
blackmun,
under
new
york
state
law
i
don't
believe
it
was,
but
there
are
statutes
in
other
states
in
this
country
which
would
seem
to
proscribe
what
is
called
industrial
espionage,
that
is
taking
a
secret
of
an
employer
and
using
it
for
your
own
benefit,
and
so
possibly
in
some
states
it
might
be
deemed
criminal,
but
not
in
new
york
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
i
don't
know,
but
i
believe
so.
we
have
checked
the
statutes
on
that
and
could
find
no
statute
which
would
make
his
conduct
criminal.
i
suppose
that
one
might
attempt
to
fashion
some
kind
of
unlawful
taking
from
what
mr.
chiarella
did,
but
our
analysis
of
the
statutes
is
such
that
that
couldn't
be
done,
but
to
be
fair
we
thought
about
that.
insofar
as
mr.
chiarella's
relationship
to
the
seller
himself,
of
course
there
was
no
privity
between
the
two
of
them.
mr.
chiarella
classically
made
no
misrepresentation.
he
didn't
say
a
half
truth.
he
had
no
duty
to
that
seller.
he
had
no
reason,
if
you
will,
to
have
made
a
disclosure.
there
is
no
rule
of
law
that
says
he
must.
now,
the
solicitor
general
does
cite
an
ancient
--
perhaps
not
so
ancient,
but
1870
english
case,
the
omphrey
case,
which
is
a
sport
among
the
vast
body
of
common
law
and
a
needle
in
a
haystack
type
case,
but
a
proposition
that
somehow
the
superior
information
was
tortiously
acquired,
it
is
unfair
for
a
seller
to
deal
with
the
buyer
without
making
that
disclosure.
aside
from
its
sporting
nature,
the
omphrey
case
is
hardly
applicable
here
in
that
the
tort
was
afflicted
upon
the
seller
in
that
case,
which
dealt
with
a
sale
of
land
and
the
fact
that
there
was
coal
under
the
land,
unknown
to
the
seller,
and
there
was
a
trespass
committed
onto
the
land
affecting
the
seller
by
the
buyer,
not
at
all
apposite.
the
background
of
section
10(b)
and
its
administrative
and
judicial
history
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
well,
because
there
there
was
conduct
which
was
directed
at
the
seller,
mr.
justice
stevens.
there
the
buyer
had
gone
onto
the
land
and
he
had
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
the
trespass
itself,
and
i
suspect
what
would
happen
there
in
the
english
court
is
that
in
those
days
when
trespass
meant
somewhat
more
than
it
may
today,
it
felt
that
that
was
something
which
was
a
fundamental
wrong
to
the
buyer
and
so
they
imported
or
created
for
that
particular
case
that
kind
of
duty.
to
our
knowledge,
the
case,
aside
from
perhaps
a
law
review
article
or
two,
has
not
been
used
since.
i
thought
it
was
fair
to
bring
it
up.
it
was
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
but
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
this
statute,
how
it
originated
and
administratively
and
judicially
how
it
has
been
administered
by
the
sfc,
i
think
you
find
little
or
no
basis
--
i
shouldn't
say
little
or
no,
it
is
giving
away
too
much
--
you
find
no
basis
at
all
for
suggesting
that
the
conduct
at
issue
here
is
within
the
statute.
to
the
contrary,
i
would
say
that
what
we
have
to
show,
it
shows
it
is
very
far
outside
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
it
is
not
what
this
fellow
did
because
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no,
no,
not
even
abstracting,
not
even
in
principle
because
the
individual
in
the
hypothetical
your
honor
gives,
is
somebody
who
in
effect
does
something
to
the
sellers
or
buyers
of
shares
in
the
market.
what
he
does,
having,
as
a
judge
does,
i
would
say
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
the
public
as
a
whole
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
i
would
say
a
judge
is
a
special
person
having
a
special
relationship
to
the
public
as
a
whole
not
to
make
use
of
his
judicial
knowledge
or
decisions
from
his
own
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
i
would
say
his
secretary
would
stand
in
his
shoes,
but
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
it
becomes
more
difficult,
the
more
remote
you
become.
but
i
would
suggest
that
much
is
in
the
typical
or
standard
insider
case,
if
you
follow
the
source
of
the
information.
in
this
particular
case,
with
the
judge,
i
would
say
he
had
some
kind
of
an
obligation
overall
to
the
community
at-large
not
to
self-deal.
now,
let
me
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
still
in
my
mind
some
difficulty
in
applying
section
10(b).
i
don't
know
whether
the
kind
of
duty
which
the
judge
has
which
may
flow
from
common
law
notions
of
what
a
judge
should
do
and
shouldn't
do,
and
up
to
the
present
time
when
we
have
specific
rules
regulating
judicial
conduct
while
on
the
bench
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
stock
you
can
own
and
not
own
and
how
you
sell
and
buy,
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
fit
within
section
10(b).
the
fact
that
it
is
something
which
may
not,
to
get
to
the
point
of
your
hypothetical,
appear
entirely
cricket
is
not
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
conduct
falls
within
a
statutory
mandate
of
is
it
manipulative
or
deceptive,
is
it
a
manipulative
or
deceptive
device.
now,
i
say
that
you
don't
have
anything
like
that
here.
the
hypothetical
your
honor
suggests
is
one
which
has
certain
equities
in
it
and
the
question
is
whether
it
was
in
the
statute,
but
i
don't
suggest
that
that
is
the
same
at
all
as
our
case
because
there
is
a
different
status
between
chiarella
and
a
judge.
chiarella
has
no
general
duty
to
the
public.
at
most,
his
duty
here
would
be
directed
toward
his
employer
and
possibly
through
that
to
the
--
well,
not
possibly
but
most
certainly
through
that
to
the
employer's
customer.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
the
mail.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
well,
no,
the
fact
that
the
confirmation
slips
of
the
particular
--
the
indictment
lists
17
counts
in
the
common
ways
of
u.s.
attorneys
in
the
southern
district,
the
number
of
counts
was
17
based
upon
five
interceptions
of
information
and
each
one
was
a
separate
mailing.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
well,
from
the
broker
to
chiarella,
that
is
the
confirmation
slip
on
the
purchase
of
stock.
those
were
the
means.
legislatively
this
statute,
section
10(b),
was
originally
introduced
as
part
of
9(c)
of
the
'34
act,
and
the
idea
there
was
--
if
you
look
at
the
statute
as
originally
constituted
before
it
was
lifted
out
of
9(c)
and
passed
in
and
of
itself
by
congress,
was
to
stop
manipulation,
that
is
something
which
artificially
affected
the
price
of
stocks.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kind
of
fact
pattern
of
a
situation
we
have
here
because
certainly
whatever
mr.
chiarella
did
did
not
artificially
affect
the
price
of
stock
on
the
market.
the
only
inside
trading,
the
only
trading
on
confidential
information
which
congress
dealt
with
was
16(b)
which
we
mentioned
a
moment
ago.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
not
artificially,
your
honor.
at
most
it
would
have
shoved
the
price
of
stock
in
the
right
direction
because
the
real
value
of
the
stock
--
and
that
is
the
point
of
the
case
--
was
the
price
at
which
a
tender
offeror
was
willing
to
tender,
how
much
it
was
willing
to
pay.
and
when
you
talk
about
artificial
prices,
you
are
talking
about
pegging,
rigging,
scalping,
and
that
kind
of
thing,
where
you
go
out
and
you
put
some
phony
information
into
the
market
and
hope
it
goes
down
or
goes
up,
as
the
case
may
be.
nothing
like
that
occurred
here.
if
anything,
it
moved
in
the
right
direction.
administratively,
too,
this
particular
section
has
always
been
considered,
almost
always
been
considered
by
the
sec
to
deal
with,
in
the
category
of
inside
information,
special
information,
if
somebody
who
had
a
fiduciary
relationship
to
the
seller
of
stock
or
some
special
relationship,
fiduciary
relationship
to
the
issuer
of
stocks
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
that
would
be
a
texas
gulf
case.
in
texas
gulf
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
he
would
be
a
tippee.
he
would
be
a
tippee
for
the
issuer
corporation
and
as
such,
assuming
that
he
knew
that
the
information
came
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
yes,
they
got
it
from
the
issuing
corporation.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
but
he
got
it
from
a
source
not
the
issuer.
there
is
a
fundamental
distinction
here.
you
see,
the
texas
gulf
case
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
and
he
had
purchased
the
issuer's
share,
i
am
conceding
that
under
texas
gulf
sulfur
he
would
fit,
yes,
assuming
he
knew
that
the
information
came
from
the
issuer.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no,
the
statute
itself
is
a
very
broad
and
generic
one.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
it
is
much
like
the
mail
fraud
statute,
and
it
doesn't
even
say
that
he
would
be
guilty
in
the
hypothetical
which
your
honor
tenders,
but
that
was
engrafted
on
the
law
in
texas
gulf
--
actually
before,
in
katy
roberts
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
oh,
no,
i'm
going
to
deal
with
that
right
now.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
say
it
wasn't
in
all
respects
proper.
at
least
it
is
arguable
in
that
texas
gulf
went
back
to
fundamental
common
law
fiduciary
relationship
between
a
corporate
officer,
director
or
control
shareholder
and
shareholders,
which
has
grown
up
in
this
country
in
the
last
forty
or
fifty
years,
perhaps
most
recently
or
more
recently
with
the
transamerica
case,
or,
said
texas
gulf
sulfur,
you
might
have
special
circumstances,
that
is
a
special
relationship
between
the
seller
of
the
shares
and
between
the
buyer
of
the
shares,
is
a
strong
opinion
which
was
a
decision
of
this
court
in
1907.
but
the
court
in
texas
gulf
in
the
second
circuit
clearly
adopted
what
is
referred
to
in
the
common
law
as
have
been
already
ruled,
imposing
some
kind
of
fiduciary
obligation
upon
a
corporate
personage,
somebody
who
has
some
fiduciary
relationship
to
the
corporation
and
taken
that
particular
minority
rule
and
relationship
and
carried
it
into
section
10(b).
but
with
our
case
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
the
beneficiary
of
that,
your
honor,
depending
on
what
you
are
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
in
texas
gulf
sulfur,
the
beneficiaries
there
directly,
the
parties
protected
--
the
parties
protected
are
the
selling
shareholders
who
have
the
right
to
expect,
have
a
confidence
in
the
officers,
directors
of
their
corporation.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
yes.
in
a
broad
sense
you
might
say
the
public
interest
is
protected
because
the
public
has
an
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
things
are
done
properly
and
according
to
law
and
that
faithful
allegiances
are
maintained.
but
the
protected
category
here
under
section
10(b)
quite
clearly
would
be
the
injured
seller
or
in
an
appropriate
case
the
injured
buyer.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
he
would
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
yes.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
i
would
think
that
the
selling
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
i
would
think
the
selling
shareholder
could
recover
on
the
ground
that
the
selling
shareholder
could
claim
to
be
an
injured
party
and
that
the
officer
of
the
issuing
corporation
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
i
think
i
missed
your
question,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
shareholders
or
the
tender
offeror
would
be
able
to
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
or
the
offeree.
you
are
talking
about
the
offeree
corporation?
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
the
offeror.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
yes.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
he
has
indeed.
they
are
his
shareholders
under
the
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
the
tender
offeror
--
excuse
me,
i
am
sorry,
i
was
off
on
something
else.
the
point
is
no,
he
would
not
have
a
duty
to
the
offeree
shareholders.
he
would
not
have
any
duty
at
all
under
section
10(b)
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no.
he
would
have
a
duty
only
to
his
company,
the
tender
offeror.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
he
wouldn't
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no,
he
would
not.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
yes,
i
would
argue
that,
certainly
so.
he
is
a
remote
tippee.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
not
to
my
knowledge,
not
in
the
shares
of
the
offeree
corporation.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
under
the
law,
under
the
williams
act,
and
before
the
tender
offeror
--
under
the
williams
act,
the
tender
offeror
can
now
acquire
up
to
five
percent
without
making
a
disclosure
under
the
williams
act.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no.
indeed
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
in
1968,
judge
friendly,
prior
to
the
williams
act
being
enacted,
said
that
we
know
of
no
rule
of
law
applicable
at
the
time
--
referring
to
prior
to
the
williams
act,
which
was
about
to
be
enacted
--
that
a
purchaser
of
stock,
who
was
not
an
insider
or
had
no
fiduciary
relationship
to
a
prospective
seller,
had
any
obligation
to
reveal
circumstances
that
might
raise
a
seller's
demand.
so
that
as
of
1968,
it
was
very
clear
that
there
was
no
such
obligation.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
that
would
undoubtedly
be
something
which
the
offeror,
tender
offeror
could
claim
against
him
in
a
suit
for
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
no,
no
way.
no
way.
there
is
no
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
inside,
not
to
the
target
corporation,
not
to
the
issuer.
it
is
very
different.
he
owes
no
duty,
if
you
will,
to
the
selling
shareholder.
now,
what
you
are
doing
is
taking
the
category
insider,
which
itself
may
not
be
the
most
accurate
term
or
label,
insider
in
one
place
and
importing
it
to
another
place.
we
say
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
exactly
right.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
i
think
that
is
exactly
right
and
i
think
a
very
fine
hypothetical
to
teat
is
what
we
are
presenting
to
this
court
here,
and
the
point
is
that
had
vincent
chiarella,
for
example,
say,
gone
to
the
target
company
and
said
let
me
sell
you
some
information
you
would
like
to
have,
why,
that
would
not
have
the
violation
clearly
of
section
10(c)
it
would
have
been
some
kind
of
contractual
or
perhaps
conversion
breach.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
because
--
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
well,
that
is
one
of
the
themes
off
the
solicitor
general
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
in
connection
which
means
a
fraud
directed
at
the
transaction,
something
which
intended
to
visit
injury
upon
the
seller
or
purchaser
of
shares.
that
didn't
take
place
here.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
there
are
10(b)
cases
which
may,
depending
on
the
standing
issue,
come
up
with
somewhat
different
way,
but
basically
all
of
the
cases
involved
have
to
do
with
imposing
a
sanction
upon
somebody
who
is
directing
his
fraud,
his
misconduct
toward
the
purchase
or
buyer
of
shares
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
yes,
but
his
conduct
was
not
directed
at
the
seller
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
well,
this
court,
if
you
will,
in
blue
chips
seemed
to
suggest
that
very
strongly,
adopting
the
burnbaum
rule
out
of
the
second
circuit.
moreover,
i
should
say
to
your
honor
--
i
know
my
time
is
up--
that
this
was
not
the
theory
on
which
this
case
was
tried,
it
wasn't
indicted
that
way,
and
that
if
for
some
reason
this
court
were
to
find
that
any
conducted
directed
to
the
tender
offeror
fitted
into
a
category
of
10(b)
violation,
that
would
run
afoul,
i
would
suggest,
of
lewis
and
bouie
and
those
cases
which
called
for
fair
notice.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
yes,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
different
arguments
have
been
made
and
rejected
by
the
government
at
various
levels
certainly
does
go
to
that
point,
yes.
the
fact
is
there
was
a
deprivation
of
due
process
here.
if
through
some
new
novel
interpretation
of
section
10(b)
it
is
found
that
mr.
chiarella
had
some
liability
under
that
statute,
it
would
have
to
be
prospective.
mr.
stanley
s.
arkin
yes,
they
did.
the
court
instructed
the
case
out
that
way
and
the
summation
of
the
prosecutor,
except
for
one
line,
was
all
towards
the
vast
injury
suffered
by
these
sellers.
