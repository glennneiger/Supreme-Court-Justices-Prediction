incidentally,
where
does
the
concept
"insider"
come
from?
is
there
a
specific
rule
under
10(b)
dealing
with
insiders?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
your
client
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
rule
under
16?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
it
really
doesn't
make
much
difference
whether
he's
an
insider
or
not,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
the
second
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
texas
gulf
sulphur
is
a
second
circuit
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
his
conduct
certainly
wasn't
very
appealing
to
a
person
of
ordinary
moral
standards.
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
it
is
criminal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
government
rely
on,
mr.
arkin,
to
show
that
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce
had
been
used
in
this
transaction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
the
offer
was
made
by
mail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
mr.
chiarella?
i
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
man
got
it
through
his
job
at
the
print
shop.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
conceding
that
texas
gulf
sulfur
wasn't
in
all
respects
properly
decided?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
inside
information
has
to
be
fitted
in
with
some
portion
of
rule
10(b)(5),
doesn't
it,
which
doesn't
say
anything
about
inside
information?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
to
whom
was
this
duty
to
disclose
owed
as
you
are
now
positing
it?
to
the
person
he
bought
the
stock
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
he
was
about
to
misappropriate
this
information?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
your
basic
submission
is
that
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
sec
make
any
violation
of
an
agency
principal
relationship
into
a
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
either
the
statute
or
the
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
talking
about
the
second
circuit
now.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
sounds
like
misuse,
misappropriation
--
they
seem
to
me
to
be
quite
loosely
used
the
government
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
decide
whether
there
is
a
legal
duty
or
not?
is
this
a
state
law
or
a
federal
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
powell's
question,
therefore
that
whether
there
was
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
corporate
president
not
to
disclose
to
the
analyst
would
depend
on
the
law
of
the
fifty
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
could
follow
as
between
strangers,
but
it
might
not
carry
over
where
you
are
talking
about
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty,
which
is
a
stricter
standard.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
don't
see
that
follows
necessarily.
it
could
follow
but
it
need
not
necessarily
follow.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
somebody
else
has
got
to
be
involved.
people
don't
write
letters
and
just
drop
them
in
the
dead
letter
box.
