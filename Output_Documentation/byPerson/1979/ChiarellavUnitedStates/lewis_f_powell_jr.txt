justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
shapiro,
may
i
ask
this
question
do
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
requiring
some
special
relationship,
fiduciary
relationship?
it
seems
to
me
it
says
--
and
here
i
quote
from
it
--
"a
test
of
regular
access
to
market
information
appears
to
us
to
provide
a
workable
rule."
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
don't
go
that
far?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
about
the
investment
analyst
that
pays
a
visit
to
a
corporation
and
obtains
more
current
estimates
of
earnings
for
the
year
than
are
available
generally,
then
that
analyst
advises
his
clients
to
buy,
has
he
violated
10(b)(5)?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
saying
that
if
a
corporate
executive
gives
any
information
to
an
analyst
who
visits
him
that
isn't
public,
and
it
may
arguably
affect
the
influence
of
the
stock
and
that
information
subsequently
is
used,
that
both
the
executive
--
i
guess
he
is
a
tipper
and
the
investment
adviser
is
a
tippee
is
that
the
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
difficulty
is
that
as
a
practical
matter
corporate
executives
wouldn't
know
whether
information
was
material
or
not
in
a
sense
that
a
jury
might
perhaps
decide.
you
talk
about
your
company.
you
talk
about
it
all
the
time.
the
country
is
full
of
analysts
and
investment
advisers
who
try
to
understand
what
is
going
on
in
corporations.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
the
point
made
in
this
case
by
your
colleague
is
that
there
is
no
proof
of
intent
in
this
case
to
defraud.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
was
the
device
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand,
of
course,
that
there
was
a
failure
to
disclose.
the
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
the
man
on
the
street
would
construe
that
as
a
device
or
scheme
or
an
artifice.
they
are
the
statutory
words
and
we
have
a
criminal
case
which
is
what
concerns
me.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
don't
defend
what
this
fellow
did,
but
i
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
haven't
you
got
new
independent
grounds
for
this?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
shapiro,
i
have
not
read
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
to
what
extent
in
those
instructions
was
there
emphasis
placed
on
the
tender
offeror
as
the
party
to
whom
the
duty
of
disclosure
was
owed?
i
thought
the
case
was
tried
on
the
other
theory.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
without
limitation.
do
they
specifically
say
that
the
tender
offeror
was
defrauded?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
second
circuit
certainly
didn't
rely
on
that
theory
at
all.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
shapiro,
i
am
going
to
have
to
go
back
a
minute.
i
gather
that
before
there
is
a
breach
of
duty
here
to
the
sellers,
there
has
to
be
a
misappropriation
of
information?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
do
have
to
find
both
elements?
you
have
to
find
some
wrong
to
the
tender
offeror
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
there
really
aren't
two
independent
grounds.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
wouldn't
say
a
fellow
who
is
eavesdropping
at
lunch
one
day
and
heard
some
inside
information
and
he
wasn't
connected
with
anybody,
he
just
heard
it
and
he
went
out
and
purchased
on
the
market
and
made
the
same
profit
as
this
man
did,
he
would
not
have
violated
10(b).
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
petitioner,
an
employee
of
a
financial
printing
firm
in
new
york,
was
convicted
in
a
criminal
prosecution
of
violating
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
rule
10b-5
adopted
pursuant
to
that
act.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit.
as
an
employee
of
a
printing
firm,
he
had
access
to
nonpublic
information
as
to
takeover
bids
that
were
to
be
made
to
stockholders
of
target
corporations.
petitioner
used
that
information
to
purchase
stock
in
target
companies.
he
made
these
purchases
through
stock
exchanges
but
did
not
disclose
the
nonpublic
information
to
the
sellers
of
the
stock.
in
this
way,
he
made
substantial
profits.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
petitioner's
failure
to
disclose
the
nonpublic
information
constituted
a
fraud
within
the
meaning
of
section
10
(b).
the
answer
to
this
question
turns
on
whether
petitioner
owed
a
duty
to
the
sellers
from
whom
he
purchased.
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
we
hold
that
a
duty
to
disclose
under
this
statute
does
not
arise
from
the
mere
possession
of
nonpublic
market
information.
it
also
was
argued
here
that
petitioner
breached
a
duty
to
the
acquiring
corporation,
that
is
the
corporation
that
planned
to
make
the
takeover
bids,
but
this
theory
was
not
presented
to
the
trial
jury
and
accordingly,
we
do
not
decide
whether
or
not
such
a
duty
exist.
section
10
(b)
of
the
act
is
drawn
in
quite
general
terms.
this
is
a
criminal
prosecution
and
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
suggests
a
congressional
intent
to
create
a
duty
and
consequent
criminal
liability
upon
persons
such
as
petitioner
who
are
not
corporate
insiders,
not
fiduciaries
and
not
persons
in
whom
the
sellers
had
placed
their
trust
or
confidence.
accordingly,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
concurs
in
the
judgment.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
with
whom
mr.
justice
marshall
joins,
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
