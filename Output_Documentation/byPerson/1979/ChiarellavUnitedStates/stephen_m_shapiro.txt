mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
section
10(b)
and
rule
10(b)(5)
forbid
the
use
of
deceptive
devices
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
securities.
the
central
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
petitioner
used
such
a
deceptive
device
we
contend
that
his
use
of
converted
non-public
market
information
to
enrich
himself
in
the
stock
market
with
out
disclosure
to
anyone
was
a
deceptive
device
within
the
prohibition
of
the
statute
and
the
rule.
in
establishing
this
proposition,
we
look
first
to
the
duties
which
petitioner
owed
to
the
tender
orderers
whose
information
he
converted.
we
then
consider
the
duties
which
petitioner
owed
to
public
investors.
we
begin
with
the
fact
which
was
admitted
on
the
witness
stand
that
the
petitioner
misappropriated
confidential
information
belonging
to
the
tender
offerors
and
used
that
information
to
purchase
securities
at
a
large
personal
profit.
because
he
was
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
sec's
dissent
decrees
in
this
area
have
made
the
restitution
first
to
the
public
investors
and
if
they
can't
be
identified
then
to
the
tender
offerors
whose
information
has
been
converted.
the
priority
has
been
given
to
the
investors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well
the
tender
offeror
is
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
case
is
not
only
a
distinguishable
one,
it
is
antithetical
in
our
view.
the
tender
offeror
makes
an
investment
decision
on
the
basis
of
publicly
available
information.
he
doesn't
steal.
he
doesn't
convert
or
he
doesn't
embezzle.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
internally
generated
information,
gotten
through
bona
fide
business
activity,
it
is
not
stolen
information.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
inside
information
in
the
cases
that
have
come
up
thus
far
can't
be
misused
in
situations
where
it
has
been
misappropriated,
where
there
is
conversion
or
theft
or
misappropriation.
this
is
the
triggering
circumstance
that
gives
rise
to
the
duty
of
disclosure,
and
that
is
how
we
distinguish
that
case
from
the
present
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
we
rely
on
subsection
(a)
and
subsection
(c)
which
deal
with
devices,
schemes
or
artifices
to
defraud
or
practices
which
operate
as
frauds.
this
court
held
in
the
affiliated
ute
case
that
total
silence
when
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose
can
be
a
device
to
defraud.
it
held
the
same
thing
in
the
capital
gains
case.,
and
that
was
the
rule
of
common
law
when
there
was
a
duty
to
speak,
total
silence
was
a
device
to
defraud.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
was
a
duty
to
disclose
here
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
is
indeed
--
to
the
tender
offerors
and
to
the
public
investors.
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
tender
offerors
and
explain
why
there
was
a
duty
to
disclose
to
them.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
precisely.precisely.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
was
a
double
failure
to
disclose
in
connection
with
a
securities
transaction.
an
agent
or
other
fiduciary
who
plans
to
make
personal
use
of
confidential
information
that
is
entrusted
to
him
has
an
unqualified
duty
to
make
prior
disclosure
to
his
principal
before
using
that
information.
at
common
law,
failure
to
make
disclosure
to
the
principal
was
a
form
of
deceit.
to
be
sure,
it
was
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
but
was
something
more
because
there
was
a
failure
to
disclose
and
a
duty
to
disclose.
secret
misappropriation
is
different
from
unfairness
or
negligence
in
the
discharge
of
a
fiduciary
duty.
under
black
letter
legal
principles,
it
is
a
garden
variety
type
of
fraud
or
deception.
petitioner
schemed
to
enrich
himself
by
using
this
confidential
information,
was
carried
on
through
stock
transactions.
in
this
case,
as
in
the
bankers
life
case,
a
stock
transaction
was
the
vehicle
for
a
fraudulent
misappropriation.
in
bankers
life,
the
defendant
engaged
in
securities
transaction
and
afterwards
converted
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
because
that
conversion
was
in
connection
with
the
securities
transaction,
this
court
held
that
it
violated
section
10(b)
and
rule
10(b)(5).
section
10(b),
we
would
point
out,
is
not
limited
to
frauds
that
injure
investors.
as
this
court
held
last
term
in
the
naftalin
case,
in
construing
the
parallel
anti-fraud
rule
in
the
'33
act,
the
anti-fraud
provisions
that
are
phrased
in
general
terms
reach
frauds
practiced
on
any
person.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
first
duty
that
we
deal
with
is
the
duty
owed
to
the
tender
offerors.
there
was
a
duty
to
disclose
to
them
prior
to
his
misappropriation
of
their
confidential
information.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
disclose
that
he
was
about
to
deal
on
his
own
behalf
or
in
his
own
interest
with
their
confidential
property.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
he
was
about
to
misappropriate
it.
that
is
a
black
letter
rule
of
agency
and
it
is
a
black
letter
rule
of
the
common
law
fraud,
and
we
rely
on
that
in
connection
with
the
tender
offerors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
had
to
disclose
that
he
was
about
to
use
their
information
to
purchase
shapes
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
the
omission
and
it
is
conceded
that
he
made
no
such
disclosure
to
these
tender
offerors
before
converting
their
information
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no
disclosure
of
any
kind.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
should
have
disclosed
to
the
tender
offerors
that
we
are
dealing
with
first
that
he
was
about
to
misappropriate
confidential
information
entrusted
to
them
to
purchase
stock
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
both
things
had
to
be
disclosed
as
a
matter
of
agency
law
and
as
a
matter
of
common
law
fraud.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
not
at
all.
only
when
there
is
a
failure
to
disclose
or
misrepresentation
in
connection
with
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
there
a
10(b)(5)
violation.
that
is
the
holding
in
the
green
case
and
we
think
that
is
a
correct
analysis.
in
this
case,
there
was
a
failure
to
disclose
where
there
was
a
duty
to
disclose,
and
under
the
green
case
that
can
be
a
violation
of
section
10(b).
that
is
the
analysis
we
rely
on
here.
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
victims
of
this
scheme,
when
we
look
at
the
tender
offerors,
weren't
purchasers
or
investors.
the
blue
chips
stamp
rule
is
a
rule
of
standing
in
private
damage
action.
it
isn't
applicable
in
a
government
enforcement
proceeding.
in
a
government
proceeding,
all
that
the
government
needs
to
show
is
that
a
deceptive
device
was
used
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
securities.
the
identity
of
the
victim
is
simply
irrelevant.
that
was
the
holding
in
naftalin
and
it
is
equally
applicable
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
statute
should
be
given
its
literal
interpretation,
that
is
all
we
are
contending
for,
that
it
reaches
any
fraudulent
device
used
in
connection
with
a
securities
transaction,
not
limited
to
particular
kinds,
not
limited
to
transactions
that
injure
particular
categories
of
victims.
it
covers
any
fraudulent
scheme.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
violates
section
10(b).
the
case
of
sec
v.
shapiro,
from
the
second
circuit,
held
that
persons
who
misappropriate
information
from
the
acquiring
company
and
use
that
information
to
buy
the
target
stock
violate
the
rule.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
question
of
who
can
recover
in
a
private
action
is
an
unsettled
area.
there
is
divergence
among
the
courts
on
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
has
been
a
breach
of
legal
duty
to
that
seller.
if
that
seller
can
be
identified
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
that
is
correct.
that
was
the
holding
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
whenever
misappropriated
information
is
used
in
the
stock
market
and
it
is
material
and
non-public,
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose.
this
has
been
the
sec's
position
in
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
it
is
information,
non-public
market
information
generated
through
bona
fide
business
activity,
with
no
element
of
misappropriation,
none
of
the
case
law
yet
has
held
that
that
brings
you
into
the
area
of
fraud.
the
element
of
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
telling
the
truth
is
not
a
violation
of
section
10(b)
because
it
is
not
deceptive,
it
is
not
fraud
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no.
if
he
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
you
need
deception
or
non-disclosure
to
come
within
the
scope
of
section
10(b).
that
is
why
your
honor's
hypothetical
is
not
a
10(b)
violation,
although
it
is
a
wrong
to
the
tender
offerors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no,
he
doesn't.
the
element
of
profit
is
irrelevant.
if
he
uses
a
deceptive
device
in
connection
with
a
stock
transaction
and
he
does
so
willfully
and
the
mails
are
used,
the
government's
case
is
complete.
personal
profit
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
court
does
appear
to
adopt
a
rule
of
regular
access
to
non-public
information.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
don't
go
that
far,
for
the
reasons
that
are
discussed
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
securities
industry
association.
many
legitimate
businesses
obtain
nonpublic
market
information
in
the
course
of
their
business
activities.
the
specialist
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
floor
does
this,
and
because
there
is
no
element
of
misappropriation
or
conversion,
the
cases
have
not
interpreted
this
kind
of
activity
as
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
the
theory
that
has
been
applied
in
these
cases
is
that
the
leaking
of
the
confidential
information
to
this
individual
is
a
misappropriation
or
a
misuse
of
confidential
corporate
information
that
shouldn't
be
available
for
the
personal
use
of
anyone
and
that
is
a
wrong
to
the
company.
and
if
he
thereafter
uses
it
for
personal
profit,
that
is
a
violation
of
section
10(b).
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
essentially
correct,
if
the
information
is
material,
confidential
information
that
hasn't
been
disclosed
to
the
rest
of
the
analysts
and
the
rest
of
the
investors
in
the
market
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
has
been
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
sec
since
the
katy
roberts
case
and
every
court
that
has
considered
it,
every
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
court
approved
that
rule
in
the
case
of
foremost
v.
mckesson.
it
said
that
misuse
of
inside
information
by
insiders
is
a
violation
of
section
10(b).
it
said
that
in
the
course
of
its
analysis
of
section
16(b)
of
the
act,
but
this
court
has
approved
that
analysis.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
is
a
violation
of
legal
duty,
that
is
what
we
mean
by
misuse.
if
this
information
is
taken
for
the
personal
benefit
of
an
employee
of
the
company
and
used
in
the
stock
market,
that
is
a
wrong
against
the
company,
of
course.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
is
ultimately
a
question
of
federal
law
of
whether
there
is
a
violation,
but
you
look
to
state
law
to
determine
if
there
is
a
duty
to
make
this
--
to
keep
this
information
confidential.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
law
in
the
fifty
states
is
consistent
on
this
point.
an
agent
that
has
confidential
information
of
its
principal,
in
your
hypothetical
the
company,
can't
misuse
that
and
can't
leak
it
to
other
persons.
that
is
a
violation
of
his
duty
under
black
letter
agency
rules.
it
isn't
a
matter
of
various
rules
under
different
state
jurisdictions.
it
is
a
settled
principle
of
agency
law.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
courts
have
wrestled
with
this
difficulty,
and
one
of
the
safeguards
against
improper
prosecution
or
improper
civil
damage
judgments
is
the
scienta
requirement.
this
has
to
be
done
with
an
element
of
mens
rea
or
scienta.
it
can't
be
done
innocently
or
even
negligently.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
district
court
charged
the
jury
that
it
couldn't
convict
unless
it
found
engagement
in
a
device
to
defraud
knowingly,
intentionally
and
willfully
with
realization
that
it
was
wrongful,
with
an
understanding
that
this
was
wrongful
conduct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
was
failure
to
disclose
to
the
tender
offerors
(a),
and
(b)
failure
to
disclose
to
public
investors
that
stolen
information
was
being
used
in
transactions
with
them.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
man
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
man
on
the
street
would
say
that
someone
that
steals
information
that
is
non-public
and
uses
that
to
exploit
a
seller
in
the
stock
market
is
guilty
of
a
cunning
device,
but
this
is
not
a
new
cunning
device.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
do
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he
had
a
duty
to
those
tender
offerors
and
that
is
a
ground
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
agree
that
the
court
could
affirm
on
that
narrow
ground,
that
is
correct,
but
we
also
think
that
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that
is
a
possibility
but
we
think
that
both
of
these
theories
are
integrally
related
and
that
they
both
have
a
clear
basis
in
prior
law
and
we
would
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
true.
information
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
because
there
was
no
embezzlement
or
conversion
in
obtaining
that
information.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
information
is
generated
within
the
corporation
through
honest
methods.
there
is
no
way
to
characterize
that
as
dishonest.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
and
at
common
law
there
wasn't
a
duty
to
disclose
when
information
was
gotten
honestly
and
that
is
the
principle
we
rely
on
here,
and
that
has
been
the
principle
that
the
sec
and
the
courts
have
used
under
section
10(b).
as
early
as
1943,
the
sec
concluded
that
misappropriated
non-public
market
information
couldn't
be
used
in
the
stock
market
to
take
advantage
of
uninformed
investors.
that
is
one
of
the
earliest
cases
under
section
10(b).
the
second
circuit
in
the
shapiro
case
held
that
you
couldn't
convert
information
from
the
acquiring
company
and
use
that
information
to
buy
the
shares
from
the
target
company
shareholders.
this
principle
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
have
collected
some
of
them
in
a
footnote.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
criminal
cases,
i
would
say
the
number
is
between
20
and
30.
they
are
collected
in
professor
loss'
treatise
and
we
cite
some
of
them.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
a
number
of
them
have
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
with
convictions,
with
appellate
court
opinions.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
what
he
had
in
mind
is
that
there
has
never
been
a
criminal
prosecution
for
misuse
of
inside
information.
he
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
there
has
never
been
a
criminal
prosecution
for
various
other
kinds
of
misconduct
in
connection
with
a
stock
transaction
because
there
have
been
dozens
of
those.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
is
one
case
that
has
some
similarity
to
this
that
we
have
cited.
it
is
the
hancock
case,
where
non-public
information
about
an
acquisition
of
a
mutual
fund
was
misappropriated
by
an
employee
and
that
information
was
used
to
purchase
up
the
stock
and
this
was
the
subject
of
an
indictment
and
a
guilty
plea
in
new
york,
that
is
the
only
case
that
fits
this
exact
factual
pattern
that
came
up
in
a
criminal
context.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that
case
was
not
cited
in
the
second
circuit.
we
have
included
it
in
our
brief
in
this
court.
i
would
like
to
speak
directly
to
the
point
of
fraud
on
the
sellers
of
these
securities.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
an
important
question
after
this
court's
green
decision
because
it
has
to
be
nondisclosure
as
opposed
to
simply
unfairness
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no
reliance
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
i
may
say,
in
a
government
enforcement
proceeding,
there
is
no
requirement
of
proof
of
injury
to
a
private
person,
simply
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
definition
is
suppression
of
the
truth
to
take
advantage
of
another
person.
that
is
the
definition
that
was
used
in
the
charge
to
the
jury,
and
here
the
suppression
of
truth
was
in
failing
to
disclose
to
the
tender
offerors
that
this
self-dealing
was
occurring,
where
there
was
a
duty
under
established
black
letter
principles
to
make
that
disclosure.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
a
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
as
the
court
in
the
green
case
pointed
out,
if
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose
and
a
failure
to
disclose,
that
is
a
fraud.
it
is
a
form
of
misrepresentation.
that
is
what
this
court
held
in
the
affiliated
ute
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
if
the
fiduciary
duty
requires
disclosure
and
there
is
non-disclosure
and
it
is
in
connection
with
a
securities
transaction,
that
is
10(b)(5)
fraud.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
what
this
court
held
in
the
capital
gains
case
and
it
held
that
in
affiliated
ute,
when
there
is
a
fiduciary
duty
to
make
disclosure
and
there
was
a
failure,
a
complete
silence
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
that
was
a
deceptive
device.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
to
the
tender
offerors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
in
that
case
you
would
have
to
address
the
question
of
whether
failure
to
disclose
is
on
the
sellers.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
it
could
well
be
a
fraud
on
the
sellers
of
the
securities,
even
though
it
wasn't
a
fraud
on
the
tender
offerors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
in
a
government
enforcement
proceeding
it
isn't
necessary
to
show
that
there
is
a
private
loss,
but
the
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
this
court
held
in
capital
gains
that
there
doesn't
have
to
be
proof
of
private
loss
in
the
government
enforcement
proceeding,
and
the
lower
courts
have
all
held
that
under
section
10(b).
that
is
not
an
element
under
section
10(b).
the
crime
is
complete
when
there
is
proof
of
a
deceptive
device
in
connection
with
a
stock
transaction,
use
of
the
mails
and
mens
rea.
that
is
the
entire
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
have
been
prosecutions
in
cases
very
similar
to
that
where
a
false
prospective
may
be
misdelivered
and
that
it
causes
no
harm
to
anyone,
but
the
convictions
are
sustained
uniformly
because
there
has
been
deceptive
conduct
in
connection
with
a
stock
transaction.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
effective.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
completed
and
cause
injury
to
a
private
party.
that
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
was
tried
throughout
on
two
theories.
in
the
indictment
it
was
charged
that
the
petitioner's
scheme
was
a
fraud
on
the
sellers
and
then,
secondly
and
independently
it
was
a
device,
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
without
limitation
on
the
victims.
and
in
the
court's
pretrial
decision
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
defendant
moved
for
dismissal
of
the
indictment
and
the
district
court
held
that
both
kinds
of
fraud
were
encompassed
by
this
language
in
the
indictment
and
that
it
could
be
a
fraud
both
on
the
tender
offerors
and
a
fraud
on
the
sellers,
and
that
is
how
the
case
was
argued
to
the
jury.
it
was
argued
as
a
fraud
on
the
tender
offerors
and
on
the
sellers.
both
theories
were
presented
and
there
was
no
question
of
surprise
to
the
defendant
because
the
district
court
held
as
its
first
ground
for
sustaining
the
indictment
that
this
conduct
was
a
fraud
on
the
tender
offerors.
both
of
these
elements
have
been
in
the
case
throughout
the
litigation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
second
circuit
relied
principally
on
fraud
on
the
sellers,
although
it
affirmed
on
this
alternative
ground
as
well.
it
didn't
give
the
same
play
to
it
that
the
district
court
had.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
jury
could
find
on
either
ground,
that's
correct,
that
is
how
the
case
was
argued.
i
would
emphasize
to
the
court
that
as
early
as
1943,
the
sec
had
held
that
it
is
a
violation
of
section
10(b)
to
convert
confidential
marketing
information
and
use
that
information
to
exploit
uninformed
investors.
that
is
the
honohan
case
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
59.
the
commission
has
also
held
that
inside
corporate
information
can't
be
misused
in
the
stock
market,
but
none
of
the
commission's
decisions
or
the
decisions
of
any
court
suggests
that
section
10(b)
is
limited
to
inside
information
frauds.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
wouldn't
concede
that
because
the
tender
offerors
did
purchase
securities,
and
if
in
fact
they
could
prove
injury
in
connection
with
those
securities
in
their
capacity
as
purchasers,
they
would
have
standing
to
sue
under
blue
chip
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
if
they
were
not
purchasers,
defrauded
as
purchasers
they
wouldn't
have
standing
to
sue
under
blue
chip.
this
court's
decision
in
the
affiliated
ute
case
in
1972
held
that
use
of
undisclosed
market
information
to
exploit
uninformed
investors
can
violate
the
statute.
that
wasn't
a
case
involving
insiders,
that
was
a
case
involving
outsiders
with
market
information.
and
the
second
circuit
in
the
shapiro
case
that
i
have
referred
to
held
that
the
same
principle
applies
to
an
acquiring
company
officer
or
consultant
who
misappropriates
confidential
information
and
uses
that
information
to
take
advantage
of
the
sellers
in
the
stock
market.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
without
some
element
of
misappropriation
of
wrongfulness
in
receiving
the
information,
that
tippee
isn't
liable.
he
has
to
realize
that
it
is
non-public
and
he
has
to
realize
that
it
has
gotten
through
some
improper
means
before
a
tippee
is
responsible.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
just
using
information
without
some
--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
our
position
is
that
stolen,
embezzled
or
converted
information
can't
be
used
in
the
stock
market
under
any
circumstances.
under
the
situations
that
you
pose,
if
someone
picked
up
a
piece
of
paper
without
realizing
what
it
was
in
a
random
way,
that
certainly
would
not
be
a
violation.
but
if
a
secretary
or
a
para-legal
working
on
a
tender
offer
prospectus
were
to
take
this
information
and
knowingly
use
it
and
realizing
that
this
was
wrongful
conduct,
that
would
be
a
violation.
it
would
indeed.
these
people
are
entrusted
with
confidential
information
and
they
have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
tender
offerors.
that
principle
is
a
principle
of
an
agency.
where
they
have
been
trusting
and
a
violation
of
that
trust,
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose
to
the
tender
offerors
before
misappropriating
their
information.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
would
say
that
that
situation,
you
would
have
theft
rather
than
embezzlement.
there
hasn't
been
an
entrusting
of
information
to
the
cleaning
woman,
but
if
she
realizes
that
she
is
stealing
something
that
belongs
to
someone
else,
that
can't
be
used
in
the
stock
market.
the
commission
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
the
investors
management
decision,
where
it
held
that
getting
information
through
burglary
or
commercial
espionage
is
an
improper
way
to
get
information
to
exploit
investors
in
the
stock
market.
