justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
talking
about
an
officer
of
the
company
that
is
making
the
tender
offer,
the
offeror.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
knows
about
this
pending
offer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
he
goes
to
some
of
the
stockholders
of
the
target
company
and
he
buys
it
up
for
his
own
account.
has
he
defrauded
those
sellers?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
no,
they
aren't
his
shareholders.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
wouldn't
have
any
duty
to
disclose
to
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
is
what
i
am
asking.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
wouldn't
have
a
duty
to
the
tender
offerees'
shareholders?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
he
would
not,
i
suppose
you
would
argue
a
fortiori
that
this
printer's
employee
wouldn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
have
there
been
some
cases
like
that
on
an
officer
of
the
offeror
trading
in
the
shares
for
his
own
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
under
the
law
the
offering
corporation
itself
may
acquire
some
of
the
shares?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
not
thought
to
be
a
fraud
on
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
before
the
williams
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
he
could,
but
could
the
selling
stockholders
of
the
offeree
also
get
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
using
inside
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reason,
of
course,
i
suppose
was
it
had
not
been
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security,
that
would
be
--
but
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
a
little
bit,
we
seem
to
be
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
your
client
may
have
defrauded
the
customer
of
the
printer,
the
tender
offeror
but
not
the
person
that
he
bought
the
stock
from.
but
even
if
that
conclusion
is
correct,
why
isn't
it
still
true
that
he
committed
a
fraud
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
defrauded
party
is
a
different
party
than
the
person
from
whom
he
bought
the
security.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
all--
it
may
be
that
blue
ship
and
all
the
rest,
but
in
essence
does
it
hold
that
the
wrongdoer
must
defraud
the
other
party
to
a
transaction?
there
are
a
lot
of
10(b)
cases
that
don't
fit
that
mold,
aren't
there?
maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
that
argument
you
just
made
applicable
to
the
arguments
that
the
solicitor
general
has
made
that
are
different
from
those
made
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
their
evidence
--
i
hate
to
go
over
time
this
way,
but
their
evidence
on
this
point
was
confined
to
the
people
who
had
bought
the
--
rather,
who
had
sold
the
stock
to
chiarella.
they
all
got
on
the
stand
and
said
i
wouldn't
have
sold
if
i
had
been
told,
isn't
that
what
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
disclose
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
that
he
was
about
to
purchase
shares
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
made
no
disclosure
of
any
kind,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
officer
of
the
tender
offeror
who
uses
his
inside
information
to
go
out
and
trade
on
his
own
account,
just
like
this
printer
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
shapiro,
excuse
me
for
interrupting
but
all
of
these
cases
are
civil
cases,
how
many
criminal
prosecutions
have
there
been
under
10(b)(5)?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
prior
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
been
prosecuted
to
a
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
10(b)(5)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
under
the
impression
that
a
dissenting
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
never
had
been
a
criminal
prosecution
under
10(b)(5).
did
he
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
never
a
criminal
case
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
meskill
said
we
have
been
cited
no
case
in
which
criminal
liability
that
10(b)
nondisclosure
has
been
imposed
on
any
purchaser
of
stock
either
inside
or
outside.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
jury
have
decided
it
on
either
ground
or
was
the
jury
required
to
find
that
there
was
fraud
on
both
the
offerors
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
shapiro,
let
me
ask
you
just
one
more.
would
you
concede
that
under
blue
chip
the
tender
offeror
could
not
have
recovered
damages
from
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
they
had
engaged
in
no
purchase
transactions
just
because
there
was
a
breach
of
duty
to
them,
they
could
not
recover
damages
just
out
of
these
five
transactions.
