justice
potter
stewart
who
is
the
beneficiary
of
that,
the
entire
investing
public?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
talking
about
the
texas
gulf
sulfur
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
is
only
the
shareholders
of
the
corporation
of
which
the
defendants
are
the
insiders,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
under
my
brother
white's
question
he
is
an
insider
of
the
offeror
corporation,
and
he
uses
that
inside
information
based
on
that
inside
information,
i.e.,
of
a
forthcoming
takeover
attempt
by
his
corporation,
he
goes
to
shareholders
of
the
target
corporation
and
buys
their
shares,
and
because
of
his
inside
information
he
has
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
price
of
the
shares
is
going
to
go
up.
justice
potter
stewart
your
insider
is
my
outsider,
in
other
words.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
if
the
printer
had
breached
his
contract
and
just
decided
to
publish,
he
is
printing
but
he
decides
he
is
just
going
to
--
it
would
be
a
hot
item
to
announce
to
the
press,
so
he
just
announces
it.
he
probably
might
be
liable
in
damages
to
the
offeror,
but
he
probably
wouldn't
have
violated
10(b),
would
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
issue
here
i
suppose
ultimately
is
was
there
a
duty
to
disclose.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
there
also
a
duty
to
disclose
to
the
tender
offeror?
didn't
chiarella
owe
a
duty
to
his
principal?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
just
so
i
may
be
clear,
your
submission
is
he
should
have
disclosed
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
there
were
two
separate
disclosures
then
--
and
that
he
was
going
to
use
this
confidential
information
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
he
breached
his
contract
and
breached
his
fiduciary
duty
to
his
principal--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
but
if
you
include
the
latter
and
say
--
if
you
say
you
had
to
have
a
breach
of
duty
to
the
seller,
you
have
some
--
it
seems
to
me
you
have
some
problem
about
permitting
the
corporation
itself
to
purchase
shares
without
disclosure
of
the
facts.
i
know
you
don't
think
so,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
certainly
before
the
williams
act
it
had
been
held
that
the
offeror
could
go
out
and
purchase
shares
without
disclosing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
no
breach
of
duty.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
just
restating
your
conclusion.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
but
there
is
no
--
i
am
talking
about
the
duty
to
the
seller.
there
is
no
disclosure
whatsoever,
although
the
corporation
knows
it
is
going
to
make
a
tender
offer.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
remember
where
they
are
cited?
it
is
in
a
footnote?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
your
point
of
fraud
of
the
customer
--
justice
potter
stewart
one
can
agree
readily
with
you
that
it
was
a
breach
of
some
sort
of
a
fiduciary
duty
for
him
not
to
disclose
to
the
customer
corporation
that
he
had
acquired
this
information
as
an
employee
of
the
printers
but
how
freely
translatable
is
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty
into
something
that
is
fraud
or
deception
or
misrepresentation?
justice
potter
stewart
there
has
to
be
reliance
to
the
detriment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
non-disclose.
justice
potter
stewart
but
fraud
means
misrepresentation
upon
which
there
is
reliance
to
the
detriment
of
the
person
to
whom
the
misrepresentation
has
been
made.
justice
potter
stewart
fiduciary
duty,
a
fiduciary
duty.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
is
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty
so
freely
translatable
into
a
misrepresentation
or
deception
or
fraud?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
shapiro,
what
if
the
fiduciary
duty
had
been
obeyed
here
and
there
had
been
a
disclosure?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
tender
offerors.
the
sellers
on
the
stock
market
wouldn't
have
known
anything
about
that,
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
presumably
it
wouldn't
thereby
be
public
knowledge,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
it
have
been
a
fraud?
where
would
it
have
been
their
loss?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
the
definition
of
fraud
though,
common
law
definition,
it
has
to
be
detriment,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
shapiro,
your
argument
as
i
understand
it
turns
on
there
being
a
relationship,
however
one
might
describe
it.
in
ute,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
what
would
normally
be
regarded
as
a
relationship
of
trust,
there
was
a
bank
involved,
a
transfer
agent
or
trustee.
in
this
case,
you
had
a
man
who
had
access
to
information,
he
would
not
normally
be
viewed
as
a
trustee.
you
used
the
word
fiduciary.
he
may
have
been
sort
of
a
sub-agent,
pandick
was
perhaps
an
agent
for
a
purpose,
but
you
carry
that
thought
along,
you
have
office
boys
in
law
firms,
for
example,
you
have
the
cleaner
who
comes
into
an
office
firm
at
night
and
who
is
smart
enough
to
do
what
this
gentleman
did,
you
go
all
the
way
down
the
line
to
anybody
who
sort
of
picks
up
information,
regardless
of
how
tenuous
the
relationship
may
be.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
cleaning
woman
who
was
smart
enough
to
understand
the
situation,
who
didn't
work
for
the
law
firm
but
who
did
pick
up
not
just
one
piece
of
paper
but
who
picked
up
drafts
of
prospectuses
of
tender
offers,
what
category
would
she
fall
in?
