we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
78-1202,
chiarella
v.
united
states.
mr.
arkin,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
said
no
special
relationship.
what
if
an
author
has
written
a
book
and
he
takes
it
to
a
printer
to
have
it
printed,
and
at
this
stage
there's
no
problem
about
copyright.
do
you
think
there
is
a
special
relationship
between
the
printer
and
the
author
to
take
no
step
that
would
jeopardize
his
copyright
standing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
this
statute,
but
you
said
no
special
relationship.
my
question
was
directed
at
only
your
statement
that
there
is
no
special
relationship
between
the
customer
and
the
printer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
a
judge
trying
a
case
in
the
trial
court
knows
that
economic
consequences
are
going
to
have
a
great
impact
on
the
market.
assume
(a)
he
has
some
stock
in
the
company
and
the
impact
is
going
to
be
to
push
the
market
down,
so
he
sells
and
then
alternatively
assume
it
is
going
to
go
up
as
a
result
of
his
holding
and
he
goes
out
to
the
bank
and
borrows
some
money
and
buys
a
lot
of
the
stock,
just
the
way
this
fellow
did
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
don't
mean
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
my
question
that
what
he
does
is
the
correct,
not
a
corrupt
decision
but
a
correct
decision,
but
he
just
takes
advantage
of
the
knowledge
that
he
has
acquired
about
the
economic
consequences.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
his
secretary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
bailiff
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
hypothetically
if
he
had
been
able
to
borrow
enough
money
and
borrowed
a
million
dollars
and
bought
a
million
dollars
worth
of
stock,
it
might
have
an
affect
on
the
market,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
(c),
subparagraph
(c),
which
reads
"to
engage
in
any
act,
practice
which
operates
or
would
operate
as
a
fraud
or
deceit
upon
any
person."
it
doesn't
limit
it
to
any
particular
person,
but
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security.
now,
he
has
engaged
in
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security,
hasn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
that
language
that
says
it
must
be
directed
at
the
seller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
that
criminal
statutes
should
be
more
broadly
construed
than
civil
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
he
need
to
profit
by
it
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
they
usually
try
to
affirm
on
the
narrowest
ground
possible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
indeed
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
in
chiarella
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
