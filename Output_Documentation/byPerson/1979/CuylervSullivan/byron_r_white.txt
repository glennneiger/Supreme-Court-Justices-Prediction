justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
also
clear,
isn't
it,
that
these
lawyers
were
retained
lawyers?
they
were
not
court-appointed.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
presumably
they
weren't
working
for
nothing,
and
if
sullivan
didn't
pay
for
them,
somebody
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
one
more
question
before
you
go
to
the
other
issue?
in
the
trials
of
the
--
carchidi,
was
it,
the
janitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
dipasquale.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
take
the
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
dipasquale?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
witnesses
testified
for
the
defense
in
carchidi's
trial
other
than
carchidi?
did
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
other
janitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
they
did
not
put
any
defense
in
at
carchidi's
trial?
other
than--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
thing
i
don't
quite
under-stand,
if
there
were
police
officers
put
on
the
stand
by
the
defense
in
the
carchidi
trial
--
presumably,
they
gave
helpful
testimony,
or
at
least,
testimony
they
thought
would
helpful
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
know
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
the
only
tactical
decision
was
whether
to
put
on
sullivan
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
the
impression
i
got
from
the
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
puzzling
case,
because
i
remember
--
as
i
remember,
peruto
did
testify
that
one
of
the
facts
in
their
minds
was
the
fact
that
if
they
did
put
on
some
other
witnesses,
that
might
prejudice
the
trials
in
the
other
two
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
nothing
they
can
do
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
a
lawyer
representing
a
defendant
just
hires
out
to
somebody
else?
suppose
he
deliberately
makes
sure
this
man
gets
convicted
--
he
knows
of
some
evidence
that
he
should
have
put
on,
but
he's
paid
not
to
put
it
on.
the
state
doesn't
know
anything
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
what
about
a
possibility
of
conflict?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
am
i
not
correct
that
the
second
time
before
the
court
was
also
a
direct
appeal
by
leave
of
court,
as
well
as
on
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
at
least
this
question
was
raised
on
direct
appeal
on
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
he--
