justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
goldblatt,
in
both
cases
the
state's
action
is
precisely
the
same.
they
try
him
both
times,
deprive
him
of
his
liberty,
and
the
judge
knows
nothing
about
the
misconduct
of
counsel;
neither
does
the
prosecutor.
yet
in
one
case
you
find
state
action,
in
the
other
you
do
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
test
of
state
action
turns
on
the
seriousness
or
the
character
of
the
constitutional
--
or
the
alleged
constitutional
violation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
something
which
took
place
without
the
knowledge
of
any
officer
of
the
state,
without
the
knowledge
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
judge,
and
without
any
duty
to
inquire,
if
i
understand
your
facts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
white's
example,
that
you
assume
mister
--
one
of
these
two
lawyers
was
paid
a
large
sum
of
money
by
the
union
to
railroad
the
first
defendant
and
get
the
two
--
other
two
off,
something
like
that.
you'd
say
--
why
would
there
be
state
action
there
and
not
in
this
case?
that's
what
i
just
don't
quite
get.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
a
private
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
state
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
isn't
what
was
decided
below.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
but
we
would
have
to
make
findings
that
were
not
found
below
to
find
actual
conflict.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
tell
me
--
just
tell
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
just
tell
me
what
basis
did
the
third
circuit
use
to
set
aside
these
convictions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
say,
actual
conflict,
or
a
possibility
of
conflict?
