ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
--
this
is
a
capital
case.
these
were
two
murder
charges
that
were
levelled
against
mr.
sullivan
and
two
codefendants.
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
that
there
were
actual
conflicts,
and
at
least
one
instance
of
prejudice,
and
this
court
need
not
reach
other
issues
raised
by
mr.
goldblatt.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
third
circuit
proceeded
just
to
apply
its
standard
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
sir,
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
moments
at
this
time
to
review
the
procedural
history.
because
i
think
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
and
that's
what
i
think
answers
the
question.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir.
the
third
circuit
pointed
to
specific
instances.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
third
circuit
referred
to
conflict.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that
is
the
standard
that
the
third
circuit
has
enunciated
in
the
past,
and
that
it
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
because
the
possibility
of
the
conflict
in
several
instances
--
and
i
will
be
glad
to
refer
to
the
record
to
show
you
which
those
instances
are
--
did
in
fact
become
the
conflict.
it
is,
in
fact,
the
conflict
in
the
lawyer's
perception
of
what
he
has
to
do
for
a
client
which
clouded
his
judgment;
and
that
is
the
conflict.
it's
not
necessarily
a
conflict
that's
borne
out
of
inconsistent
defenses,
although
that,
too,
is
a
conflict.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
i
would
say
that
that
is
what
the
third
circuit
did
in
this
case.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
and
the
third
circuit
did
it
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
no,
sir,
because
i
think
that
the
third
circuit's
enunciated
standard
is
a
good
standard.
i
would
say
that
this
court
need
not
decide
whether
there
was
a
speculative
conflict,
or
whether
there
was
a
potential
for
a
conflict,
whether
there
was
anything
vague
about
what
the
third
circuit
did.
because
the
factual
underpinnings
of
this
case,
which
the
third
circuit
noted
in
its
opinion,
would
support
a
conclusion
of
an
actual
conflict.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
i'd
like
to
say,
sir,
of
dibona's
testimony
that
he
testified
that
he
and
peruto
were
co-counsel
in
this
case.
the
fiction
somehow
that
there
was
a
lead
counsel
and
a
backup
counsel
did
not
spring
from
any
testimony
in
the
record.
quite
to
the
contrary,
both
attorneys
viewed
themselves
as
having
the
same
responsibilities.
it
may
be
that
one
--
that
during
certain
periods
of
the
trial,
that
mr.
peruto
was
not
examining
witnesses
whereas
mr.
dibona
was;
but
there
were
also
periods
of
time
when
mr.
peruto
was
doing
the
death
penalty
speech
to
the
jury;
when
mr.
peruto
in
fact
rested
the
case
for
the
defendant,
sullivan,
without
putting
on
any
evidence,
and
said,
"my
client
trusts
the
case
to
me,
and
i
rest
the
case.
"peruto,
in
fact,
voir
dired
the
jury;
this
was
a
death
penalty
voir
dire,
and
peruto
conducted
that
voir
dire.
the
third
circuit
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
there
were
so
many
indicia
of
actual
representation
by
peruto
that
in
fact
it
supported
the
conclusion
that
was
reached
by
dibona
in
his
testimony
that
the
two
were
in
fact
co-counsel
in
this
case.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
could
i
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
basis
is
that
mr.
peruto,
who
also
represented
mr.
sullivan,
was
co-counsel
with
mr.
dibona;
that
the
two
of
them
had
ongoing
responsibilities
to
the
other
two.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
well,
sir,
mr.
peruto
was
being
deferential
to
mr.
dibona
because
mr.
dibona
was
at
that
time,
the
time
of
post-conviction
proceedings,
judge
dibona,
and
mr.
peruto
had
to
appear
before
him
many
times.
however,
that
is
not
all
that
mr.
peruto
said
in
this
record.
if
i
may
quote
the
other
instances,
i
can
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir,
that
was
his
testimony.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
i
take
the
third
circuit
to
have
examined
the
precise
procedural
history
of
this
case,
and
to
have
concluded
that
the
factual
underpinnings
supported
this
conclusion
of
law
that
there
was,
number
one,
dual
representation,
and
number
two,
a
conflict
of
interest,
or
at
least
a
possibility
for
a
conflict
of
interest.
and
if
i
might
take
a
moment
at
this
time,
sir,
to
discuss
the
procedural
history,
because
i
fear
that
there
be
some
cloud
on
that
history,
as
it
was
rather
tortuous
when
it
proceeded
through
the
courts.
it
appeared
that
after
sullivan
was
convicted,
an
appeal
--
well,
post-verdict
motions
were
filed
by
both
attorneys.
thereafter
the
case
rather
sat
for
almost
a
year,
during
which
time
--
six
months
after
the
conviction
of
sullivan
--
carchidi
was
tried
and
was
acquitted,
and
dipasquale
was
tried
and
was
acquitted.
thereafter,
post-verdict
motions
were
argued
for
sullivan
by
both
counsel,
and
were
denied
2-1
--
there
was
a
court
involving
three
judges--2-1,
there
was
a
denial.
then,
mr.
dibona
and
mr.
peruto
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
and
that's
where
the
case
sat
for
some
--
well
over
three
years.
because
the
appeals
were
filed,
if
my
recollection
serves
me
correctly,
in
august
of
1968.
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
never
decided
this
case
until
december
29th
of
1971.
it
is
entirely
possible,
and
likely,
i
say,
from
the
factual
context,
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
did
not
decide
the
case
for
that
very
lengthy
period
of
time
because
there
was
no
argument
by
either
counsel,
mr.
dibona
having
become
a
judge
at
this
time.
mr.
peruto
did
not
argue
these
capital
cases
before
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
continuances,
numerous
ones,
were
requested
during
this
lengthy
period
of
time.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
very
strong
controversy
as
to
whether
any
brief
was
ever
filed
on
behalf
of
sullivan.
the
duties
and
obligations
which
were
owed
to
sullivan
were
simply
dropped.
they
were
simply
abandoned.
and
he
was
abandoned
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
as
he
was
to
later
argue,
on
post-conviction
proceedings.
now,
that
is
the
reason
post-conviction
proceedings
were
initiated
some
years
later.
it
was
not
because
he
sat
on
any
rights
he
thought
he
had.
and
it
was
not
because
he
wanted
merely
to
express
some
sort
of
lament
later
on
that
he
wasn't
acquitted,
as
were
the
two
codefendants.
it
was
because
that
was
filed
most
timely,
the
post-conviction
proceedings
followed
by
a
short
period
of
time
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
and
petition
for
reargument
that
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
following
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
1971,
sir,
that's
right.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that's
correct,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
there
is
a
very
strong
question.
and
that
was
one
of
the
issues
raised
in
post-conviction
proceedings.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that's
right;
it
is
not.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that's
correct,
sir,
3-3,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
on
december
29,
1971.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
there
was
an
opinion,
but
the
opinion
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
conflict
of
interest.
it
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
dual
representation,
because
those
issues
were
never
raised.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
they
were
--
the
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that's
correct.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
same
counsel
filed
the
appeal,
you
see.
and
so
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
case
got
back
to
that
court,
interestingly
enough,
mr.
chief
justice,
following
post-conviction
proceedings,
where
we
argued
in
those
proceedings
the
denial
of
a
right
to
appeal.
and
so
the
lower
court
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
philadelphia,
held
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
in
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
the
appellate
process
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
appellate
rights,
that's
right.
and
ordered
a
direct
appeal,
once
again.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
at
that
time,
yes,
i
did
raise
the
conflict
question.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir.
there
--
the
issue
of
conflict
was
then
raised
for
the
first
time.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
problem
of
conflict?
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
the
first
time.
because
our
position
is
that
there
is
some
evidence
on
the
record
of
the
trial
that
should
have
alerted
the
trial
judge
to
a
conflict
of
interest.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
however,
it
was
actually
asserted
by
counsel
--
by
counsel
other
than
dibona
and
peruto
--
in
post-conviction
proceedings.
and
that
was
the
first
time
that
the
time
was
opportune
to
make
that
assertion,
because,
on
appeal,
whatever
that
first
appeal
was
or
wasn't
same
counsel
allegedly
represented
mr.
sullivan.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
second
time,
sir
--
yes,
your
honor.
the
second
time
there
was
an
appeal
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
post-conviction
court
to
take
a
direct
appeal.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
and
at
that
time,
under
pennsylvania
law,
the
other
issues
then
were
undecided.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
question
of
a
conflict
was
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
on
direct
appeal
on
the
merits;
it
was,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
'75,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that's
right.
it
took
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that
was
the
first
time
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
knew
about
it,
yes.
the
post-conviction
court
knew
about
it
in
1973
when
the
petition
was
filed,
and
amended
petitions
were
filed.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
and
that
was
the
first
time
the
issue
was
raised.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
the
result
there
was
a
5-2
decision,
first
of
all
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
held
that
it
was
proper
to
proceed
in
this
matter,
and
that
the
lower
court
was
correct
in
permitting
an
appeal
to
be
taken
on
the
ineffective
assistance
in
the
appellate
process
issues;
and
then
proceeded
to
decide
adversely
to
sullivan
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
adversely
as
to
the
conflict
issue
as
well,
except
that
there
is
in
my
opinion
quite
a
decision
to
be
made
here,
because
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
then
decided,
"we
will
not
really
reach
the
conflicts
issue,
because
we're
going
to
decide."
--
excuse
me
--"
that
there
was
no
dual
representation."
and
the
ground
for
the
decision
that
the
supreme
court
asserted
for
not
finding
dual
representation
was
then,
for
the
first
time,
this
what
i
consider
to
be
a
fiction,
that
there
was
primary
and
secondary
counsel.
there
really
is
no
such
status
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
he
did
not
say
that
himself.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
he
was
deferring
to
judge
dibona's
recollection,
because
dibona
--
judge
dibona
had
testified
earlier
in
the
post-conviction
proceedings.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir;
he
did
say
that.
that's
correct.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
interestingly
enough,
in
the
perception
of
counsel,
judge
dibona
also
said
that
he
was
lead
counsel
in
the
carchidi
case
at
that
time.
so
that
i
think
there
really
are
problems,
factually,
and
i'm
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
he
was
lead
counsel
in
that
case,
sir,
as
he
tried
the
case.
but
at
the
time
of
the
sullivan
case,
there
is
some
evidence
that
mr.
dibona
referred
to
himself
as
counsel
for
my
other
client,
carchidi,
and
considered
himself
lead
counsel
for
carchidi.
now,
they
may
have
changed
back
and
forth;
i
don't
really
know,
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that.
on
the
issue,
incidentally,
of
the
carchidi
trial,
i
would
most
certainly
take
issue
with
mr.
goldblatt,
because
i
--
although
it
is
true
that
the
post-conviction
judge
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
agreed
to
incorporate
the
carchidi
record
in
the
sullivan
record.
i
don't
know
whether
that
was
actually
done.
because
i
do
not
have
that
record.
and
i
have
been
told
by
the
district
attorney's
office,
that
the
district
attorney's
office
does
not
have
it.
the
original
record
is
certainly
not
in
the
original
court
file
in
philadelphia.
and
so
i
would
make
the
assumption,
therefore,
that
it
is
not
before
this
court.
and
i
do
not,
therefore,
know
in
fact
what
happened
in
the
carchidi
trial.
but
i
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter,
where
you'd
have
an
actual
conflict,
no,
sir.
because
the
same
attorney
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that's
right.
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
trial
judge
knew
that
there
was,
at
the
very
least,
a
possibility
of
a
conflict.
the
trial
judge
first
of
all
was
assigned
all
three
cases.
and
therefore
became
aware
of
the
fact
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
i
do.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
i
do
disagree,
and
i
will
make
an
effort
to
go
into
the
factual
background,
because
i
do
think
it's
important
in
this
case.
you
see,
dibona,
who
tried
this
case
to
the
jury,
opened
to
the
jury,
and
told
the
jury
that
there
were
very
important
witnesses,
three
of
whom
were
outside
the
window
of
the
building
where
these
crimes
were
committed,
and
if
in
fact
the
crimes
were
committee
at
the
time
that
the
commonwealth
was
arguing
they
were
committed,
then
these
three
witnesses
who
were
waiting
for
--
to
come
into
the
union
hall
for
a
meeting
would
most
certainly
have
heard
the
shots
ring
out
as
well,
and
they
would
be
very
important
to
show
that
the
crime
actually
was
committed
at
the
time
that
the
commonwealth
wanted
the
court
to
believe
that
it
was
committed.
now,
there's
no
question
that
the
crimes
were
committed.
there's
no
question
about
the
heinous
character
of
the
crimes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
kind
of
factual
background
has
been
used
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
over
and
over
again.
the
importance,
however,
is
as
to
what
evidence
there
was
which
implicated
sullivan
in
the
commission
of
these
crimes.
and
that
was
the
issue
that
split
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
3-3
the
first
time
on
the
sufficiency
that
before
that
split
the
lower
court
involved,
2-1.
the
issue
of
mr.
sullivan's
complicity,
if
at
all,
was
a
very,
very
important
issue.
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
capital
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
counsel,
whose
loyalties
were
not
divided,
would
have
done
everything
that
he
or
she
could
have
done
to
bring
about
a
property
verdict.
now,
that
would
have
included
using
independent
judgment
as
to
whether
to
call
to
testify
three
witnesses
outside
the
window
at
the
time
the
crimes
were
committed.
now,
there
was
independent

what
is
it?
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
no,
sir.
that's
exactly
the
point.
they
were
under
subpoena
to
the
prosecution
and
they
were
ready
and
available
to
testify.
in
fact,
another
witness
not
in
that
same
category,
outside
the
window,
was
also
under
subpoena
to
the
prosecution.
those
four
witnesses
were
outside
the
courtroom
under
commonwealth
subpoena,
ready
to
be
called.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
dibona
said
that
in
his
opening
argument;
he
said
that
in
the
side
bar
conference
with
the
judge;
he
said
that
in
his
closing
argument.
he
argued
--
after
he
put
on
no
testimony
at
all
--
he
argued
in
closing,
i
don't
know
the
commonwealth
didn't
call
this
witnesses
who
were
outside
the
window
at
the
time
that
these
crimes
were
committed.
and
in
so
doing,
he
really
invited
the
prosecutor
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
defense
hadn't
called
those
very
witnesses.
judge
dibona
said
those
witnesses
were
vital
at
that
time.
yet
he
didn't
call
them.
and
that
is
the
same
judge
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that's
what
mr.
peruto
said
years
later.
he
was
then
asked
at
post-conviction
hearing
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
well,
not
the
part
about
the
witnesses
outside
the
window
at
trial.
that
took
place
at
trial,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that's
right.
because
that
was
the
first
time
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
--
this
respondent
could
raise
it.
and
when
he
did
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
well,
if
what
you're
saying,
sir,
is
that
you
don't
see
the
difference
between
retained
or
appointed
counsel,
i
would
agree
that
there
should
be
no
distinctions
made
between
retained
and
appointment
counsel.
and
i
think
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
because
i
think
that's
necessary
corollary
of
sixth
amendment
effectiveness.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir,
you
do
have
a
right
to
pick
your
own
lawyer,
even
if
he
is
a
jackass.
i
think
that's
right.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
no,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
no,
sir,
i'm
not
saying
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes.
i'm
saying
that
in
case
where
there's
a
conflict,
the
harm
can
be
so
egregious,
because
conflict
infects
the
whole
trial,
because
conflict
will
upset
fair
trial
or
will
upset
fact-finding,
because
that's
such
an
egregious
wrong
to
the
defendant
and
to
the
whole
system
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
because,
in
this
case,
this
respondent
wanted
to
take
the
witness
stand,
wanted
witnesses
called
for
him
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
this
respondent
didn't
know
that
it
was
disadvantaged.
so
i
can't
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
because
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
because
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
--
at
least
at
one
juncture
in
this
case
said
to
the
lawyers
that
he
was
tired
of
trying
to
get
discovery
for
the
other
clients.
he
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
lawyers
were
making
efforts
to
get
discovery
for
the
other
clients,
carchidi
and
dipasquale,
and
that's
in
the
record.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
what
is
it?
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
at
least
inquire
of
the
defendant
whether
he
understood
that
he
had
a
right
to
conflict-free
counsel,
where
initially,
there
were
three
defendants
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
not
necessarily
appointed
by
the
court.
the
inquiry
should
be
directed
to
whether
he
knew
and
understood
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney
with
undivided
loyalty.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
sir,
i
think
that
the
extent
of
the
inquiry
that
could
be
conducted
between
a
judge
and
a
defendant
before
him
is,
in
fact,
limited
by
attorney-client
privilege.
there
was
never
any
effort,
however,
to
find
out
anything
about
this
defendant's
understanding
of
his
right
to
separate
counsel.
never
any
effort
whatever.
i
agree,
if
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
in
fact
the
trial
judge
could
not
have
inquired,
"mr.
sullivan,
exactly
what
are
your
defenses?
would
you
please
tell
me
what
they
are
so
i
can
decide
whether
your
lawyers
are
incompetent.
"i
think
that
those
limits
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
i
think
you're
right
sir.
i
agree
with
you.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
yes,
sir.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
well,
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
is
our
american
system.
but
it's
also
our
american
system
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
well,
this
isn't
question
of
whether
sullivan
could
or
couldn't
have
his
own
lawyer.
this
is
a
question
of
what
happens
where
he
agrees
to
allow
the
codefendants
lawyers
to
represent
him.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
no;
he
agreed.
i
said
that.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
it
was
voluntary.
i'm
not
suggesting
it
wasn't.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
it
could
be,
yes.
it
could
also
be
that
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
didn't
know
that
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
i
think
that's
correct,
sir;
i
don't
know
from
the
record,
but
i
think
that's
correct.
at
any
event
the
--
the
trial
that
resulted
from
what
we
consider
to
be
conflict
resulted
because
of
the
fact
that
mr.
peruto
guarded
evidence,
held
it
close
to
the
vest,
did
not
disclose
it
in
the
trial
of
sullivan,
and
he
did
so
out
fear
that
in
so
guarding,
he
may
be
tipping
his
hand
in
the
case
of
the
two
codefendants
who
were
not
yet
tried.
and
i
think
that
that
creates
a
situation
more
egregious,
more
difficult
to
handle,
then
a
situation
where
all
three
were
tried
at
one
and
the
same
time.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
when
he
was
subpoenaed
to
testify
in
post-conviction
proceedings.
he
there
testified
under
oath,
sir
--
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
seven
years.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
that's
right.
and
he
testified
under
oath,
and
the
circuit
--
the
third
circuit
ruled
that
there
was
no
reason
to
disbelieve
mr.
peruto's
admission
of
professional
impropriety;
that
that
was
a
very
difficult
thing
that
he
did
at
that
time;
and
he
did
so
testify.
ms.
marilyn
j.
gelb
no,
sir.
nor
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
the
bar
done
anything
about
it.
but
i
think
that's
one
of
the
problems
that
the
courts
should
be
sensitive
to,
and
that
is,
the
possibility
that
conflict
may
occur,
which
are
hidden,
and
which
do
not
surface
until
years
later.
i
think
there's
likelihood
that
that
will
happen
where
in
fact
you
have
a
separate
trial
of
a
defendant
who
is
represented
by
a
lawyer,
who
has
yet
two
other
clients
yet
to
try,
and
as
to
whom
he
guards
and
holds
back
evidence.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
sir.
