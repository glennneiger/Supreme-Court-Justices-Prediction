each
one
of
them
was
tried
separately?
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
two
subsequent
trials?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
a
re-appeal
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
which
coincided
with
the
appeal
in
the
habeas.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
goldblatt,
you
said
earlier
in
your
argument,
the
record
wasn't
clear
as
to
who
paid
the
lawyers.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
defendants
who
were
tried
later,
rather
than
the
respondent,
had
paid
the
lawyers.
is
that
not
clear?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that,
though,
what
the
third
circuit
and
the
district
judges
assumed?
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
third
circuit
made
that
factual
assumption
for
the
purposes
of
its
decision,
and
if
you
haven't
questioned
that,
shouldn't
we
assume
that
to
be
the
fact
for
our
decision?i
don't
know
if
it
makes
any
difference.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
the
legal
issue
might
be
a
little
different
if
you
say
a
man
being
represented
by
counsel
for
two
codefendants
who
are
paying
the
lawyer,
conceivably
you'd
have
a
little
different
standard
than
one
where
there
isn't
that
factual
situation.
i
don't
know,
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
it
at
least
clear
that
sullivan
did
not
pay
for
his
own
lawyer?
is
that
much
clear?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
no
contrary
testimony
either?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
unrebutted
testimony.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
it
did
not
find
--
how
can
you
say
it
found
an
actual
conflict,
if
that's
the
standard
it
applied?
justice
potter
stewart
the
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
on
december
29,
1971.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
appeal
was
never
argued;
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
some
question
about
whether
or
not
a
brief
was
ever
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
issue
here,
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event,
that
appeal
was
never
argued.
and
the
affirmance
was
by
an
equally
divided
court,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
mean
there
was
no
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
know
if
there
was
a
brief.
but
in
any
event,
if
there
was
a
brief,
they
were
never
raised.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
was
no
brief,
they
certainly
were
never
raised.
justice
potter
stewart
ms.
gelb,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
your
kind
of
ultimate
theory
here.
justice
potter
stewart
the
possibility
of
a
conflict.
you
say
there
was
an
actual
conflict,
i'm
sure.
justice
potter
stewart
secondarily,
you
argue,
the
possibility
of
a
conflict
is
enough,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
third
circuit
holds.
if
you
take
that
position,
is
it
your
view
that
if
the
trial
judge
was
on
notice
of
the
fact
that
peruto
and
dibona
had
these
other
clients
with
other
trials
pending,
that
it
was
his
duty
just
to
say
to
them
--
call
the
--
what
was
he
supposed
to
do,
call
the
defendant
up
and
say,
you
have
a
right
to
have
a
separate
lawyer?and
then
i
assume
if
the
defendant
said,
well,
i'm
satisfied
with
these
two
lawyers,
would
that
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you'd
then
have
to
prove
actual
conflict
if
he
did
that.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
your
view
of
the
conflict?
the
conflict
is
that
there
are
some
witnesses
he
might
have
put
on
if
--
you
disagree
with
your
opponent
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
we
don't
know
who
those
witnesses
are
or
anything
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
an
explanation
for
that.
the
last
thing
i
suppose
this
court
should
do
would
be
to
get
into
all
these
details.
but
there
was
an
explanation,
and
that
is,
they
fear
that
one
or
more
of
those
witnesses
would
say
that
he
saw
one
or
more
of
those
people
running
out
of
the
room,
running
out
the
building.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
all
of
this
took
place
years
later.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
explanation
took
place
years
later,
and
so
did
all
this
business
about
the
conflict
took
place
years
later,
too.
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
think
the
third
circuit
thought
it
was
propounding
a
constitutional
standard?
it
did,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mere
possibility.
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
it
first
adopt
that
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
the
hart
case
involved
--
at
least
according
to
judge
garth
as
i
understood
his
dissenting
opinion
--
the
hart
case
involved
joint
representation.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
in
dissent.
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
used
the
actual
conflict
standard?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
did
decide
there
was
no
conflict?
