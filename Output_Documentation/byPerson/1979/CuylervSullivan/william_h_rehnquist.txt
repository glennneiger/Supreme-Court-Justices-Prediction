justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
goldblatt,
before
you
get
to
that,
in
your
question
three,
on
your
petition
for
certiorari,
you
raise
the
--
whether
the
federal
court
failed
to
give
proper
deference
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania's
determination
on
a
factual
issue;
that
is,
whether
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest.
now,
are
you
arguing
now
that
dual
representation
is
or
is
not
a
mixed
question
of
fact
or
law,
a
question
of
law,
a
question
of
fact,
and
whether
conflict
of
interest
is
a
question
of
fact
if
not
dual
representation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
court
didn't
have
to
believe
a
quote
interested
statement
of
sullivan
on
the
point.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
that
basis,
there
wouldn't
be
any
state
action
if
some
state
presented
perjured
testimony
unknowingly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
state
action
in
my
example?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
not
by
the
--
just
by
the
fact
that
the
state
has
convicted
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
state
has
convicted
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
that
we
are
entitled,
here,
to
judge
the
case
on
--
by
the
standard
of
actual
conflict?
is
that
the
standard
we
should
use?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
we
should
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
we
should
judge
this
case
by
that
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
gelb,
we
do
have
a
cold
record
here,
as
the
third
circuit
also
did.
and
if
you'll
look
at
9b
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
which
has
a
portion
of
the
third
circuit's
opinion,
they
refer
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania's
findings
--
it's
the
blue-they
refer
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania's
language,
"we
therefore
hold
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
a
conflict
existed."
that's
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
then
the
third
circuit
goes
on
to
say,
"respondents
urge
that
this
conclusion
is
a
finding
of
fact
by
a
state
after
a
full
hearing
which
is
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
correctness
and
should
be
accepted
by
this
court.
petitioner
argues
that
we
should
reject
it.
the
magistrate
accepted
petitioner's
position,
while
the
district
judge
accepted
respondents'.
we
believe
both
were
mistaken
in
their
approach
to
this
problem.
"now,
what
do
you
take
the
third
circuit
to
mean
by
saying
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
weren't
some
of
the
three
witnesses
called
by
the
prosecution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
weren't
some
of
those
three
witnesses
you're
referring
to
called
by
the
prosecution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right;
exactly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
was
the
second
appeal
in
the
pennsylvania
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
in
dissent.
but
in
any
event,
i
take
it
then
that
the
standard
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
used
in
the
second
appeal
was
different
than
was
currently
being
applied
by
the
third
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
that
--
and
about
the
same
federal
constitutional
issue.
so
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
two.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
the
third
circuit
standard
urged
upon
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
might
have
found
something
else;
but
they
certainly
found
that.
