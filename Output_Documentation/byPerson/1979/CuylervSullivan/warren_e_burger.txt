mr.

i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.

chief

e.

when
was
this
case
tried?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
june?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
this
gentleman
been
in
the
meantime?
is
he
still
incarcerated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
he's
been
incarcerated
some
10
or
11
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
they
believed
judge
dibona,
they
didn't
have
much
alternative
about
the
decision,
did
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
the
issue
of
dual
representation
first
raised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
on
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
after
the
original
conviction
and
trial
was
the
collateral
proceeding
in
which
this
issue
was
first
raised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
years
after?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
leave
it,
the
first
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
would
vindicate
the
judgment
of
the
trial
counsel
that
this
case
--
or
give
some
vindication
to
the
notion
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
put
on
any
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
not
mr.
peruto,
on
some
of
the
disputed
items,
say
that
he
would
defer
to
dibona's
recollection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
dibona
was
the
lead
counsel,
and
he
made
the
decisions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
lead
counsel
agree
with
mr.
peruto?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
get
into
the
matter
of
state
action?
if
you
showed
those
facts,
you'd
show
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
there
would
not
have
been
any
real
representation.
so
state
action
becomes
irrelevant.
chief
justice
warren

possibility,
however
remote.
chief

to
say
about
dibona's
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
one
was
to
believe
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if

to
believe
judge
dibona's
testimony
--
mr.
dibona
at
that
time
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
what's
the
basis
for
the
third
circuit's
conclusions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
peruto
testified
that
wherever
his
testimony
was
different
from
that
of
dibona,
he
would
defer
to
mr.
dibona
because
he
was
lead
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
judge
dibona's
testimony
was
that
he
urged
sullivan
to
take
the
stand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
when
did
the
case
get
back
to

appeal.
chief
justice
warren

time

second
direct
appeal,
what
was
the
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
didn't
mr.
peruto
say
that
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
he
had
deferred
to
mr.
dibona.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
said
he
deferred
because
dibona
was
lead
counsel,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
as
between
the
two
counsel,
they
thought
that

was
a
lead
counsel
and
a
co-counsel.
chief

about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
