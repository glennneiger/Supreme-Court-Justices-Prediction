mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
does
involve
federal
review
of
a
state
conviction
pursuant
to
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
prosecution
is
here,
and
has
sought
review,
of
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit,
reversing
the
decisions
of
the
federal
district
court
and
the
pennsylvania
state
courts.
the
third
circuit
granted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
the
basis
that
the
defendant's
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
had
been
violated
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he'd
been
denied
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel.t
he
case
--
the
primary
issue
in
the
case
involves
the
issue
of
conflict
of
interest,
and
whether
there
was
an
adequate
showing
of
conflict
of
interest
here
to
warrant
the
granting
of
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
relief.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
1967.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
crime
--
excuse
me
--
the
crime
occurred
in
june
of
1966.
the
crime
was
tried
in
june
of
1967.
so
it
is
almost
13
years
old
at
this
time,
since
the
time
of
trial.
the
crime
itself
was
an
execution-style
killing
of
two
people
inside
a
local
teamsters'
union
hall
in
philadelphia,
pennsylvania
in
june
of
1966.
three
defendants
were
indicted
for
the
crime
in,
i
believe,
december
of
1966,
after
a
coroner's
inquest.
the
three
defendants
privately
retained
two
lawyers
to
represent.
as
these
were
first
degree
murder
cases,
they
were
tried
separately.
the
commonwealth
moved
for
trial
on
respondent's
case
first.
he
was
convicted
of
two
counts
of
first
degree
murder.
the
two
other
defendants
were
subsequently
tried
separately
and
acquitted.
on
the
first
direct
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
tried
separately
and
acquitted,
yes.
this
was
the
only
defendant
who
was
convicted.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes,
there
were.
in
any
event,
there
were
two
lawyers
who
represented
the
three
defendants.
they
were
privately
retained
by
the
three
defendants.
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
record
as
to
how
they
were
paid,
but
there
is
no
question
but
that
they
were
not
appointed
by
the
court.
the
two
lawyers
were
two
of
the
most
prominent
lawyers
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
in
an
event,
after
the
first
conviction
it
went
up
on
appeal.
it
was
affirmed
by
an
evenly
divided
court.
subsequent
thereto,
state
habeas
proceedings
were
commenced
in
state
court,
and
there
was
an
extensive
hearing.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
he
is
not
incarcerated
at
this
time.
bail
has
been
set.
it
was
not
allowed
by
the
federal
courts,
but
bail
was
set
by
the
state
courts
after
the
third
circuit
granted
relief,
habeas
relief.
so
he
is
on
bail
at
this
time
waiting
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
he
was,
yes.
he
was
incarcerated
i
believe
at
the
time
he
was
arrested
on
this
crime
up
until
the
time
he
was
released
after
third
circuit
relief
was
granted.
in
any
event,
when
it
went
back
to
state
habeas
proceedings,
the
two
lawyers
who
represented
the
three
defendants
testified
along
with
the
trial
judge,
the
defendant,
one
of
the
co-defendants
as
well.
as
the
testimony
developed,
it
appeared
that
each
of
the
defendants
selected
at
his
option
one
of
the
two
lawyers
to
be
lead
counsel;
the
other
to
be
backup
counsel.
sullivan
selected
one
lawyer,
judge
dibona,
who
unfortunately
died
about
two
weeks
ago.
the
other
two
defendants
selected
the
other
attorney
as
their
lead
counsel.
mr.
dibona
testified
at
the
post-conviction
hearing,
which
is
our
state
habeas
proceeding,
that
there
was,
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
no
conflict
of
interest
in
the
case.
all
the
decisions
he
made
were
based
on
the
best
interests
of
his
client
sullivan;
and
that
he
perceived
no
problems
in
any
of
his
representation.
now,
the
key
to
this
case,
and
the
key
that
troubled
the
third
circuit
was,
mr.
peruto,
when
he
testified,
indicated
in
one
small
part
of
his
testimony
that
he
had
some
regrets.
he
felt
that
perhaps
he
may
have
advised
sullivan
to
hold
back
on
presenting
his
defense,
because
he
thought
the
case
was
won.
he
thought
sullivan
had
the
case
won,
because
the
commonwealth
did
not
present
sufficient
evidence
to
convict.
and
therefore,
why
put
on
the
defense
when
you
could
save
it
for
the
other
two
cases.
now,
as
i
say
judge
dibona
indicated
that
he
had
absolutely
no
basis
or
motivation
for
his
decision
not
to
put
on
a
defense;
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision
at
all.
in
any
event,
when
the
case
got
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
on
the
conflict
issue,
that
court
ruled
that
there
was
no
true
dual
representation
in
the
true
sense,
because
of
the
lead
counsel
situation,
and
the
backup
counsel
situation;
and
found
under
the
circumstances
that
there
was
no
conflict
on
the
record.
the
district
court
essentially
upheld
that
ruling,
finding,
in
its
conclusion
--
crediting
judge
dibona's
testimony
as
to
what
motivated
him
as
to
why
he
did
what
he
did.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
third
circuit,
however,
the
panel,
when
they
got
the
case,
held
that
the
legal
conclusion
that
there
was
no
dual
representation
was
erroneous;
that
there
was
a
clear
indication
on
the
record
that
there
was
dual
representation.
and
there
were
indices
that
peruto
did
participate
in
the
defense
of
sullivan.
there's
no
question
about
that,
and
we
don't
dispute
that.he
was
present;
he
was
at
counsel
table;
and
did
aid
in
the
defense
of
sullivan.
the
key
to
the
case
is
the
standard
employed
in
the
third
circuit
for
view
of
conflict
problems,
and
that
is,
the
possibility
of
conflict,
however
remote
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
what
i
am
saying
--
argument
three,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
goes
to
the
question,
assuming
the
third
circuit
panel
is
correct
in
their
conclusion
--
two
conclusions,
one
that
there
is
evidence
of
dual
representation
on
the
record.
and
i
would
concede,
that
is
a
legal
conclusion
from
the
record.
it's
not
a
factual
conclusion.
and
if
they're
also
correct
that
the
standard,
possibility
of
conflict,
however
remote,
is
an
appropriate
standard
of
review,
even
in
that
event
this
case
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
district
court.
because
the
third
circuit,
in
rejecting
the
district
court
and
state
court,
made
its
own
findings
of
fact,
based
on
a
record
that
is
totally
disputed
in
every
way
and
every
step
of
the
way
up.
in
other
words,
it's
not
a
situation
where
they're
adopting
district
court
findings
or
state
court
findings;
nobody
has
made
relevant
findings
under
their
theory
of
the
case.
and
they
proceeded
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
issue
of
dual
representation
was
first
raised,
of
course,
in
the
state
habeas
proceedings.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
not
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
there
was
no
pretrial
request
for
separate
counsel.
there
was
no
issue
of
separate
counsel.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
on
first
appeal
there
was
no
issue,
either.
it
was
not
until
collateral
attack.
so
what
i'm
saying,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
don't
reach
argument
three
until
we
get
through
argument
--
the
first
two.
if
we
win
it,
and
are
successful
in
convincing
the
court
that
there
should
be
an
actual
conflict
standard,
argument
three
won't
even
be
reached.
there's
not
enough
evidence
on
this
record
to
find
an
actual
conflict.
excuse
me.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
believe
the
collateral
proceeding
at
which
this
was
first
raised
would
have
been
in
about
1972
or
3,
and
i'm
sure
counsel
will
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
it
was
some
years
after,
no
question
about
that.
there's
no
question
the
first
time
this
issue
comes
up
is
well
after
conviction,
well
after
the
first
appeal.
of
course,
the
first
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct.
what
happened
at
the
first
habeas
proceedings
in
state
courts,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
that
the
hearing
court
found
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
the
first
direct
appeal.
ironically,
one
of
the
reasons
they
found
ineffective
assistance
was
because
the
case
had
not
been
argued
on
direct
appeal,
and
because
the
court
had
split
3-3
on
the
issue
of
sufficiency
of
evidence.
so
a
new
appeal
was
granted.
on
the
new
appeal,
it
was
argued
and
fully
briefed
by
both
sides,
and
the
court
split
5-2,
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence.
in
any
event,
moving
back
to
the
focus
of
the
issue,
as
far
as
the
standard
employed
by
the
third
circuit,
we
would
submit
that
this
is
not
a
standard
at
all.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
there
is
no
question;
as
matter
of
fact,
the
third
circuit
even
noted
that
had
independent
counsel
made
every
decision
that
was
made
in
this
case,
they
would
have
little
trouble
finding
effective
assistance.
they
found
every
decision
that
was
made
strategically
sound,
but
held
simply
because
of
the
possibility
of
conflict,
however
remote,
on
the
record,
the
entire
proceedings
had
to
be
vitiated,
and
unless
the
state
retried
him,
the
defendant
had
to
be
discharged
from
custody.
now,
this
court
of
course
has
dealt
most
recently
in
holloway
v.
arkansas
with
a
situation
where
there
is
a
pretrial
request
for
separate
counsel
by
a
lawyer;
and
the
court
has
held
there
that
absent
an
inquiry
by
the
court
to
determine
that
no
conflict
existed,
that
request
must
be
honored.
that
representation
by
counsel
that
there
is
a
potential
for
conflict.
this
presents,
however,
the
issue
left
unanswered
in
holloway,
which
is,
what
do
you
do
when
the
issue
is
first
raised
on
collateral
attack,
where
there
is
no
objection
pretrial?
here
you
have
the
additional
factors
that
you
have
separate
trials
for
these
defendants;
this
isn't
a
joint
trial.
these
are
separate
trials
with
the
same
lawyers
representing
them,
which
substantially
reduces
any
potential
for
problems
of
conflict
of
interest,
or
certainly
eliminates
a
myriad
of
problems
that
could
otherwise
occur.
and
what
we
submit
is,
especially
when
we're
dealing
with
a
state
habeas
review,
a
standard
of
possibility
of
conflict,
however
remote,
is
far
too
lenient
and
far
too
minimal
to
justify
the
granting
of
relief.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
there's
not
even
a
clear
indication
of
that
because
what
happens
is,
there
was
some
testimony
--
and
again
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
third
circuit
assumed
that.
and
i
think
it
assumes
it
from
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
sullivan
at
the
state
habeas
hearing
that
he
didn't
have
any
money;
he
didn't
pay
them;
he
didn't
know
how
it
came
about.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
that's
argument
three.
argument
three
in
our
brief
is,
assuming
all
the
legal
standards,
and
when
you
get
there,
the
third
circuit
made
any
number
of
factual
findings
to
reach
its
conclusion
that
had
never
been
found
by
the
district
court;
that
had
never
been
found
in
the
state
courts.
what
the
third
circuit
did
was,
they
said,
well
the
state
courts
didn't
reach
the
issue
we
wanted.
and
they
didn't
make
adequate
state
findings.
for
that
purpose,
we
don't
dispute
it.
what
we're
saying
is,
at
that
point
they
can't
make
the
findings
from
a
cold
record.
because
the
record
is
disputed.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
you
may
or
you
may
not.
you
don't
have
enough
on
this
record
to
really
determine
who
was
paying.
you
don't
now
if
the
teamsters
were
paying.
i
mean,
you
can't
tell
where
the
source
for
the
money
was
coming
from.
all
we
know
is,
sullivan
testifies
that
he
speaks
to
the
two
codefendants.
they
said,
"well,
you
can
use
our
lawyer
too."
that
was
already
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
there
is
that
testimony
from
sullivan.
that
is
all
i
can
say.
there
is
no
credited
factual
finding
that
sullivan's
testimony
is
truthful.
even
the
third
circuit
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
absolutely
clear;
there
was
no
court
appointment
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
there
was
some
indication
actually
in
the
record
that
perhaps
they
were
working
for
nothing.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
certainly
not.
that's
our
point,
though.
all
this
material
in
the
record
is
just
testimony;
there
are
no
findings.
the
various
state
courts
and
the
district
court
largely
found
it
irrelevant
on
the
basis
of
judge
dibona's
testimony,
which
was
credited.
the
third
circuit
gets
the
case,
and
they
say,
"we
don't
really
care
that
much
about
judge
dibona's
testimony.
we
find
dual
representation
if
peruto
did
anything
in
the
case.
and
we
are
now
going
to
glean
the
record,
and
pick
and
choose
what
we
think
may
be
possibilities
of
conflict.
"now,
what
we're
saying
is,
if
there's
a
credited
factual
finding
after
the
disputed
record
is
resolved
by
a
fact-finder,
then
if
you
find
possibility
of
conflict
by
an
appellate
court,
fine.
but
you
can't
just
take
a
cold
record
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
he
most
certainly
did.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
indeed
--
and
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
third
circuit
opinion
about
it
--
peruto-what
we've
been
arguing
all
along
is
that
a
large
part
of
peruto's
testimony
should
be
believed.
we
have
never
conceded
that
that
portion
of
peruto's
testimony
where
he
said
he
felt
he
was
operating
under
a
conflict
should
be
believed.
and
indeed,
we
argued
through
the
state
courts
and
the
district
court
that
that
should
be
expressly
disbelieved.
we
have
never
argued
that
that
should
be
credited.
now,
the
third
circuit
said
when
we
got
there
that
we
suddenly
were
arguing
that
the
court
should
believe
peruto's
testimony.
we
were
simply
making
the
same
argument
we
made
all
along,
that
parts
of
it
should
be
believed,
but
other
parts
of
it,
not.
in
any
event,
just
to
focus
back
on
the
problem,
we
submit
that
the
standard
for
state
habeas
review,
on
collateral
attack,
where
there's
been
no
objection
pretrial,
where
there's
been
no
trigger
to
a
constitution
requirement
that
the
judge
inquire
pretrial
at
all
presented
by
the
case,
that
the
defendant
should
be
required
to
show
actual
conflict.
now,
the
point
we've
attempted
to
make
here
is
that
mr.
peruto's
testimony
that
he
wanted
to
hold
back
the
defense
witnesses,
even
if
credited,
is
meaningless
unless
you
show
that
there
are
defense
witnesses
that
could
be
presented.
and
judge
dibona
testified
that
once
the
decision
was
made
by
the
defendant
to
not
testify,
there
were
no
good
witnesses
to
present.
so
what
we
have
is
the
third
circuit.
now,
in
the
third
circuit's
response
--
that
we're
saying
is,
please
look
at
the
record--there
was
no
showing
of
any
real
defense
witness
to
present.
the
third
circuit
said,
"no,
that
we
will
not
do.
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
make
an
actual
conflict
determination.
and
that
we
won't
do.
all
we're
concerned
with
is
the
possibility,
however
remote.
"and
what
we
submit
is,
the
possibility,
however
remote,
is
not
a
standard
of
reversal;
it's
a
standard
of
prohibition.
and
this
was
noted
in
the
three
judge
opinion,
dissenting
from
the
denial
of
reargument,
that
the
effect
of
a
possibility
of
conflict,
however
remote,
standard,
when
applied
the
way
it
way
in
this
case,
is
to
literally
bar
joint
representation
within
those
courts
that
come
into
the
circuit.
because
the
risk
is
so
great
that
you're
going
to
lose
on
collateral
attack,
if
that's
the
only
thing
that
the
defendant
has
to
show,
that
there's
literally
no
point
in
risking
joint
representation.
now,
with
that
in
mind,
we
have
a
second
issue
which
is
more
or
less
alternative
to
the
first;
it's
not
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
carchidi.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
dipasquale.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
carchidi
did
testify
at
his
trial.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
dipasquale,
i
believe,
never
got
that
far.
there
was
a
directed
verdict
--
literally,
a
directed
verdict
of
not
guilty.
the
commonwealth
was
forced
to
trial.
they
had
attempted
to
nolle
prosequi
the
case
because
their
key
witness
would
not
testify.
no
evidence
was
presented
at
all.
after
no
evidence
--
after
the
commonwealth
was
ordered
to
proceed;
presented
no
evidence;
the
jury
returned
the
verdict.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
interestingly
enough,
at
page
183
of
the
appendix,
judge
dibona
testified
that
only
one
civilian
witness
testified
at
the
carchidi
trial.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
was
michael
hessian,
and
he
was
called
by
the
commonwealth.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
there
was
a
defense.
there
were
various
police
officers
who
were
put
on
at
carchidi's
trial.
but
they
literally
showed
no
witness
having
not
been
presented
at
sullivan's
trial
that
was
presented
at
carchidi's;
that
was
held
back
from
the
sullivan
trial
because
of
the
conflict.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
they
did
not
know
of
that
testimony
at
the
time
of
the
sullivan
trial.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
they
didn't
know
about
it
when
that
was
litigated.
neither
lawyer.
there
was
no
conflict
problem
with
that;
they
just
did
not
discover
the
availability
of
a
particular
piece
of
evidence.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
there
was
that
tactical
decision
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
well,
the
third
circuit
opinion
--
again,
this
is
what
we
argued
--
there's
an
argument
that
there
were
three
witnesses
outside
the
union
building.
those
weren't
put
on
at
carchidi's
trial,
according
to
judge
dibona's
testimony.
and
the
point
we're
making
is,
nobody
ever
showed.
everybody
said
--
peruto
said
there
were
three
witnesses
outside
the
union
hall
who
he
didn't
want
to
put
on
at
sullivan's
trial,
because
he
was
afraid
that
they
might
identify
one
of
the
other
two
defendants.
now,
what
was
never
shown
was
what
on
earth
those
witnesses
were
going
to
testify
to
to
help
sullivan.
everyone
was
going
to
tell
--
peruto
was
willing
to
say
why
he
didn't
want
to
put
them
on,
but
never
explained
why
he
would
have
wanted
to
put
them
on.
there
was
no
showing
how
they
could
have
helped
sullivan.
and
that's
the
point
we're
making.
no
such
witness
was
presented
at
the
state
habeas
proceeding
to
say,
i'm
available,
i'm
a
witness,
i
could
have
testified
to
the
following.
you
run
the
risk
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
correct.
but
that's
the
problem
he
says
that,
but
when
it
comes
to
the
next
point,
okay,
who
are
you
talking
about?
that's
where
the
record
drop
out.
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
what
we're
saying
is,
under
the
third
circuit
standard,
you
run
the
risk
of
granting
someone
a
new
trial,
effectively,
so
that
he
can
put
on
a
defense
that
doesn't
exist.
because
you
haven't
inquired
far
enough
to
find
that
actual
conflict,
to
make
them
put
that
witness
up
and
show
who
it
is.
that's
why
the
record
is
so
confusing.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
the
lead
counsel
most
certainly
did
not
agree
with
mr.
peruto.
he
said
"no
conflict,
no
witnesses.
"as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
witness
they
offered,
they
witness
they
said
should
have
been
called,
for
the
defendant,
was
the
codefendant
carchidi.
now,
one
thing
i
think
is
perfectly
clear,
that
if
there
had
been
separate
counsel
in
this
case,
there
is
no
way
counsel
for
carchidi,
who
was
awaiting
trial
on
two
murder
counts
with
a
possible
death
penalty,
was
going
to
allow
him
to
testify
at
sullivan's
trial.
that
is
the
only
tangible
witness.
and
he
testifies
at
the
state
habeas
proceeding
after
he
has
been
acquitted,
and
says,
"yes,
i
would
have
testified
for
sullivan
had
he
called
me."
that,
i
would
submit,
is
not
an
available
witness.
and
again,
what
he
would
have
done
to
aid
the
defense
is
not
even
clear
from
the
record.
now
the
one
point
i
would
like
to
touch
on,
and
that
would
go
to
argument
two
in
our
brief,
which
as
i
say,
is
an
alternative
argument,
is,
whether
or
not
the
defendants
have
made
out
the
requisite
state
action.
now,
it's
clear,
coming
in
via
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
must
be
some
state
action.
and
what
we
would
submit
is,
under
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
given
the
fact
that
both
lawyers
were
retained,
absent
a
showing
of
actual
conflict
rather
than
the
possibility,
however,
remote,
that
there
is
no
state
action.
there
is
nothing
the
court
could
have
done.
there's
nothing
the
court
should
have
been
aware
of
to
do.
there
is
nothing
the
prosecutor
should
have
done,
or
should
have
been
aware
of.
and
we
would
submit,
where
retained
counsel
is
in
the
case,
and
there
is
no
actual
concrete
conflict
that
is
shown,
there
is
no
state
action.
and
this
is
fairly
consonant
with
the
fifth
circuit
standard
on
general
ineffectiveness
claims,
and
what
must
be
shown,
where
you
have
retained
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
because
when
i
think
you
would
get
into
a
question
of
the
state
being
the
operating
force
for
doing
it.
in
other
words,
the
state
is
still
putting
on
that
testimony.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
all
we're
saying
here,
mr.
justice
white
is
that
where
there's
an
actual
conflict,
then
the
state
apparatus
is
automatically
implicated,
regardless
of
whether
the
judge
knew
about
it
or
the
prosecutor.
but
where
there
is
absolute
--
only
a
possibility,
however
remote,
there's
nothing
in
the
state
machinery
that's
implicated
in
creating
the
error.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
actual
conflict.
in
other
words,
all
i'm
saying
here
--
i'm
not
saying
that
where
you
have
retained
counsel
in
a
situation
where
you
can
come
into
court
and
prove
that
an
actual
conflict
took
place,
that
you're
not
entitled
to
relief.
there
i'm
saying,
yes,
you
would.
because
there
you
implicate
not
only
the
sixth
amendment;
you
also
implicate
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
in
that
example
where
you
have
actually
shown
a
conflict
of
interest
existed,
you
have
a
denial
of
a
fundamentally
fair
trial,
number
one.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
just
by
virtue,
the
state
has
convicted
him.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
and
that
is
the
state
of
--
as
it
is
applied
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
they
say,
where
there's
actual
conflict,
it's
automatically
implicated.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
where
you're
talking
about
the
possibility
of
conflict,
however
remote,
that
is
not
enough.
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
an
actual
conflict
of
interest,
not
merely
a
guess;
not
merely
a
probability.
there
the
defendant,
in
order
to
show
the
requisite
state
action,
should
at
least
be
required
to
show
that
his
conviction
was
tainted
by
an
actual
conflict.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
you
will,
firstly,
of
course
have
the
state
machinery
implicated
in
every
criminal
case.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
it
will
be
there
in
any
case.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
it's
not
so
much
the
seriousness
or
the
character
of
it;
it's
the
degree
of
proof.
where
you
can
in
fact
show
that
an
actual
conflict
took
place,
then
the
implication
of
state
action
will
be
assumed.
but
where
you
haven't
shown
it
--
it's
almost
a
degree
of
proof.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
in
fact
you've
shown
that
it
is
something
that
took
place
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
all
i'm
saying
is
if
--
what
i'm
saying,
to
analogize
to
this
case,
what
i'm
arguing
is,
if
you
come
in
and
you
prove
that
somebody
was
paid
off,
there
is
state
action.
if
you
come
in
and
you
prove
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
by
a
private
party.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
state
action
is
that
implication
of
the
state
machinery
in
the
process.
all
i'm
saying
is,
in
one
case
you
would
prove
that
the
state
has
obtained
a
conviction
through
that
payoff,
be
it
advertently
or
inadvertently.
in
the
other
instance,
you
haven't
proved
that.
all
you
have
proved
is
a
possibility
that
might
have
occurred.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
it
would
become
immaterial
in
that
sense.
but
all
i'm
submitting
is,
it's
more
a
degree
of
proof
problem,
rather
than,
you
know,
what
type
of
violation
occurred.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes,
sir.
one,
i
would
point
out
that
the
reference
to
who
was
presented
as
witnesses
at
the
carchidi
trial
was
not
taken
from
the
carchidi
record,
which
is
not
before
the
court.
it
was
taken
from
the
record
that
is
before
the
court
at
pages
183
to
184a
of
the
appendix.
that's
judge
dibona's
testimony,
who
was
present
at
both
trials.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
touch
on
two
things
one,
the
inquiry
requirement.
i
would
point
out
that
for
purposes
of
the
federal
rules,
that
rule
44(c),
which
will
set
up
a
federal
inquiry
requirement,
is
now
pending
with
congress,
having
been
promulgated
in
1979
as
a
matter
of
supervisory
power.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
basis
for
concluding
in
1967,
where
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
judge
should
have
sensed
the
conflict
problem,
especially
given
separate
trials,
that
there
is
nothing
to
find
in
the
constitution
to
require
that
the
judge
should
have
done
it
then,
or
even
now.
we
have
as
an
addendum
to
our
brief
listed
the
various
circuits
and
their
approaches
to
this
problem,
and
we
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
constitutional
predicate
at
this
time
for
the
inquiry.
i
would
also
like
to
stress
that
three
members
of
this
court
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
for
evaluating
the
conflict
question.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
a
possibility
of
conflict,
however
remote,
is
there
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
nineteen
--
hart
v.
davenport
was
the
first
case,
and
i
believe
it
was
1972.
and
they
subsequently
held
that
they
didn't
need
an
inquiry
--
they
weren't
going
to
--
they
didn't
need
an
inquiry
requirement
after
that
ruling.
they
were
right.
the
inquiry
is
almost
irrelevant
except
to
set
up
a
waiver
in
the
third
circuit
under
that
standard.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
1977
it
was
decided.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
joint
representation.
and
one
of
the
things
judge
garth
said
was,
there
is
no
reason
to
apply
that
standard
willingly
in
separate
trial
cases.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
never
adopted
the
standard
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
right.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
it
was
not.
by
the
defense,
no
it
was
not.
there
was
no
suggestion
of
the
third
circuit
standard
at
that
time,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
what
they
did
was
--
it's
very
tricky
language
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes,
that
is
correct.
what
they
said
was,
there
was
no
dual
representation
in
the
true
sense
of
term,
is
their
exact
language
and
that
under
those
circumstances,
they
found
that
no
conflict
existed
on
the
record
before
them.
those
are,
almost
verbatim,
their
words.
and
i
don't
want
to,
you
know,
paraphrase
them,
because
it's
very
critical.
the
third
circuit
found
that
there
was
dual
representation,
and
went
from
there
applying
their
own
standards.
but
i
think
you
can
argue
from
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
decision
that
they
looked
at
the
record
based
on
judge
dibona's
testimony
no
actual
conflict.
and
that's
the
standard
they
implied.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct.
the
one
final
thing
i'd
like
to
mention,
three
members
of
this
court
in
holloway,
in
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
powell,
suggested
that
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
request
for
separate
counsel
that
is
denied
by
the
court
without
inquiry,
then
in
that
circumstance,
it
should
not
be
as
the
majority
of
course
found
fatal
to
the
case,
but
they
should
be
--
the
prosecution
should
be
allowed
to
have
a
hearing,
at
which
the
ultimate
issue
would
still
be
whether
or
not
the
conflict
prevented
the
defendant
from
presenting
some
potentially
successful
defense.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
what
i'm
saying.
here,
where
there
is
no
protest,
under
the
standard
suggested
by
the
dissent,
we
still
win.
we're
asking
for
no
more
than
that.
we're
asking
for
nothing
more
than
they
come
into
court
and
prove
that
they
were
harmed
by
something.
they
have
not
done
it,
and
we
would
respectfully
request
that
they
not
be
entitled
to
relief.
thank
you.
