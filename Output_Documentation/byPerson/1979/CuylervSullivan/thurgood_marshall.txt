justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
raise
the
conflicts,
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
this
post-conviction,
the
one
you're
just
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
first
time
the
state
of
pennsylvania
was
made
aware
of
this
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
brother
stevens
point
about
--
i
guess
you'd
call
it
the
state
action
point,
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
the
state
get
in
this?
make
you
take
a
lawyer?
pick
a
lawyer
for
you,
and
force
the
lawyer
upon
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is
where
do
you
get
the
right
for
the
state
to
be
required
to
give
you
separate
lawyers
when
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
the
right
to
pick
your
own
lawyer?
don't
you
have
a
right
to
pick
your
own
lawyer,
if
he's
a
jackass?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
you
saying
that
you
don't
have
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
state
must
come
in
and
give
you
another
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
what
are
you
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
know
what
where
you
got
one
man
on
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
do
you
say
the
state
should
have
moved
in
and
appointed
counsel
for
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
did
the
court
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
nobody
--
well,
who
did
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
should
the
judge
have
done
at
that
stage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
should
the
trial
judge
have
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
appointed
by
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
the
attorney-client
privilege?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
mr.
sullivan
would
say,
"judge,
i
don't
have
to
answer
that
question,
because
it's
none
of
your
business."
justice
thurgood
marshall
"i
have
a
point
--
i
have
hired
a
counsel.
i
have
paid
him
with
my
eye
teeth."
and
that's
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
our
american
system?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
system
--
what
is
the
system
where
you
can't
have
our
own
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
didn't
threaten
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
agreed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
that
you
don't
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
judge
didn't
know
that,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
judge
assumed
that
that
was
retained
counsel?
