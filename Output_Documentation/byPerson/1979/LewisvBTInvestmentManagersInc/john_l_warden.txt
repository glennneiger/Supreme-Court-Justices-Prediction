mr.
john
l.
warden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
point
out
initially
that
the
statutory
provision
that
dean
griswold
was
just
referring
to,
which
is
at
d2
of
the
appendix
of
the
red
brief,
contains
no
territorial
limitation.
it
has
never
been
construed
by
the
board
to
contain
the
limitation
that
dean
griswold
contends
should
be
read
into
it.
indeed,
until
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
wasn't
aware
that
that
argument
was
being
made
in
this
case.
and
if
that
construction
is
adopted
by
the
court
with
no
basis
whatsoever,
it
will
result
in
invalidating
literally
hundreds
of
substantial
acquisitions
made
by
bank
holding
companies
with
the
approval
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
not
disturbed
by
any
judicial
proceeding
for
many
years.
mr.
john
l.
warden
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
board
has
construed
this
court's
decision
in
whitney
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
as
requiring
it
to
give
effect
to
state
law
in
ruling
on
applications
whether
--
whatever
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
law.
in
other
words,
it
will
not
determine
the
constitutional
question.
it
remits
the
parties
to
the
court
for
that
purpose
which
is
why
this
case
was
instituted
in
a
three-judge
district
court
in
florida
and
brought
up
here
as
it
has
been.
so
the
board's
final
action
was,
“we
would
have
approved
or
we
would
likely
have
approved
this
application
but
for
the
recent
one,
hastily
enacted
florida
statute
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
no,
i
do
not.
the
court
noted
in
its
opinion
in
whitney
that
the
board
had
at
that
point,
considered
that
section
7
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
permitted
states
to
preclude
the
doing
of
business
by
bank
holding
companies
entirely
to
preclude
that
form
of
commercial
organization.
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case.
of
course,
since
florida
permits
the
doing
of
business
by
bank
holding
companies,
it
permits
that
form
of
commercial
organization.
but
i
don't
believe
there's
any
indication
that
the
board
reads
section
7
as
permitting
an
--
and
otherwise
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
out-of-state
firms.
mr.
john
l.
warden
no,
i
said
and
otherwise,
and
they
don't
read
section
7
as
--
as
constituting
a
congressional
validation
of
otherwise
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
out-of-state
firms.
i
know
of
no
suggestion
to
that
effect
in
the
board's
(inaudible).
and
they
made
no
such
allusion
in
their
opinion
in
this
case.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
note
that
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
interstate
commerce
is
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
which
dean
griswold
addressed,
i
do
not
notice
that
contention
made
in
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
appellant.
and
the
fact
that
the
business
that
bankers
trust
proposes
to
engage
in
would
be
conducted
in
interstate
commerce
was
not
disputed
by
florida
before
the
three-judge
district
court
and
in
fact
was
conceded.
mr.
john
l.
warden
to
this
--
to
this
sort
of
statute
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
i
did
not.
mr.
john
l.
warden
well,
that
is
correct.
and
i
--
i
must
say
i
don't
think
that
--
as
i
shall
approach
that
part
of
the
argument
later
that
there's
any
need
for
administrative
expertise
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
in
determining
that
question.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
l.
warden
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
--
though
--
the
consistent
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
line
of
authority
in
this
court
has
been
that
it
has
negative
implications
of
its
own
force
for
state
statutes
that
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
there
is
no
federal
statute
involved,
for
example,
in
philadelphia
against
new
jersey,
at
least
of
which
i'm
aware.
and
i
believe
that
dean
griswold
has
conceded
in
his
brief
on
behalf
of
the
conference
of
state
bank
supervisors
at
page
9,
note
4
that
the
commerce
clause
has
exactly
the
same
scope
when
relied
upon
to
strike
down
discriminatory
state
regulation
as
when
relied
upon
to
justify
affirmative
congressional
regulation.
now,
to
continue
briefly
on
the
interstate
commerce
question,
the
three-judge
court
addressed
directly
the
question
to
counsel
for
the
state
of
florida
below
whether
“the
defendant
made
any
serious
contention,”
i
quote
that,
that
bankers
trust
would
not
be
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
in
the
business
it
proposes
to
conduct
and
counsel
replied,
and
i
quote,
“the
defendant
does
not.”
i
might
add
that
a
new
york
based
financial
institution
operating
these
businesses
in
florida
by
means
of
local
officers
directed
from
new
york
and
affecting
the
flow
of
capital
funds
into
the
national
capital
market
is
inescapably
involved
in
interstate
commerce.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
this
case
does
not
involve
banking
or
any
issue
of
competitive
equality
between
state
and
national
banks
or
any
question
of
the
dual
regulation
of
banks.
the
distinction
between
the
business
of
banking
and
the
businesses
here
involved,
trust
services
and
investment
advisory
services
is
recognized
not
only
in
the
bank
holding
company
act
by
congress,
which
i
shall
address
in
a
moment,
but
right
on
the
face
of
florida
statute,
section
659.141
which
expressly
discusses
as
discrete
businesses
the
business
of
banking,
the
trust
business
and
investment
advisory
services.
mr.
john
l.
warden
[laughs]
i
think
not.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
banks
may
do
trust
businesses
and
investment
advisory
businesses
but
so
to
many
other
sorts
of
commercial
institutions
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
and
indeed
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
they
are
not
unrelated
to
banking.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
quite
right.
mr.
john
l.
warden
and
then
otherwise
the
federal
reserve
board
wouldn't
have
given
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
the
affirmative
indication
of
that
but
i
point
out
that
not
only
the
paine
webber
has
engaged
in
investment
advisory
services
but
other
forms
of
non-deposit
trust
companies
such
as
what
we
proposed
to
set
up
here,
engaged
in
trust
services
and
so
do
natural
persons
who
have
no
banking
powers
whatsoever.
i
think
we
use
the
illustration
in
our
brief
that
the
manufacturer
of
aircraft
doesn't
become
the
manufacturer
of
automobiles
because
it's
carried
on
by
general
motors.
now,
i
should
also
point
out
because
i
thought
it
might
have
been
a
bit
unclear.
well,
i'm
talking
about
659.141
that
that
statute
itself
bars
us
both
from
the
investment
advisory
business
and
from
the
trust
business,
irrespective
of
--
of
660
because
659.141
keeps
us
out
whether
we
have
a
local
incorporated
subsidiary
or
open
an
office
of
an
out-of-state
subsidiary.
mr.
john
l.
warden
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
warden
i
think
you
would,
mr.
justice
stevens,
because
as
--
as
dean
griswold
suggested
in
his
brief,
it
appears
that
the
lower
court
may
have
read
660.10
as
of
its
own
force
precluding
bankers
trust
new
york
corporation
and
holding
company
from
complying
with
its
terms
by
incorporating
a
local
subsidiary.
now,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
on
its
face.
mr.
john
l.
warden
yes,
mr.
john
l.
warden
well
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
but
florida
has
not
yet
represented
or
conceded
in
this
proceeding
that
the
statute
will
not
be
so
construed
and
enforced
if
florida
does
so
or
if
this
court
rules
that
that
is
not
what
the
statute
means,
then
section
660.10
insofar
as
that
was
the
basis
for
the
lower
court's
decision
does
not
have
to
be
reached
by
this
court.
mr.
john
l.
warden
well,
at
that
point,
bankers
trust
took
the
position
that
there
was
nothing
unclear
about
the
statute.
mr.
john
l.
warden
well,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
the
lower
court
did
construe
the
statute
the
way
dean
griswold
suggest
it
may
have,
the
lower
court
clearly
erred
in
that
question
of
state
law,
is
so
clear
that
it
should
be
disposed
of
by
this
court.
mr.
john
l.
warden
but
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
that
is
--
yes,
i
am,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
that
will
be
a
necessary
part
of
this
court's
decision
if
it
is
going
to
set
aside
the
declaration
below
that
660.10
is
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
that
it
prevents
of
its
own
force,
bankers
trust
from
complying
with
it.
but
let
me
--
let
me
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
well,
it's
a
suggestion,
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
white,
that
you
can
read
statutes.
mr.
john
l.
warden
in
this
case,
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
l.
warden
in
this
particular
instance,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
warden
but
i
might
--
but
i
might
add,
mr.
justice
white,
that
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
we
should
lose
on
that
part
of
the
case.
i'm
going
to
get
to
another
aspect
of
that
statute
in
just
a
moment,
but
the
decision
below
need
not
be
affirmed
on
that
basis
if
this
court
construes
the
statute
not
to
operate
as
it
may
have
been
thought
to
operate
by
the
district
court.
there
will,
nonetheless,
remain,
the
effect
of
660.10
on
bankers
trust's
new
york
subsidiaries
which
conduct
a
large
trust
business
and
are
precluded
by
that
statute
from
themselves
acting
as
an
executor
or
testamentary
trustee
even
without
a
local
office.
other
florida
resident,
even
when
named
in
his
will
as
such.
now,
this
result,
i
don't
think,
can
be
justified
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
i
didn't
hear
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
dean
griswold
suggest
that.
the
statue
contains
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
some
exceptions
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
but
it
says
in
the
first
paragraph
[laughs]
that
only
local
incorporated
banks
and
trust
companies
and
national
banking
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
associations
having
trust
powers
may
do
the
following
within
this
state
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
and
that
includes
acting
as
a
trust
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
trustee.
mr.
john
l.
warden
i
don't
think
that
660.10
can
be
read
as
dealing
with
anything
other
than
a
requirement
of
local
incorporation.
i
don't
think
it
can
possibly
be
read
to
permit
out-of-state
corporations
from
doing
the
very
businesses
it
says
they
can't
do.
mr.
john
l.
warden
and
even
if
it
were
so
read,
as
i
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
659.141
of
its
own
force
by
its
plain
language,
prevents
the
doing
of
these
businesses
in
florida
by
out-of-state
holding
companies
either
directly
or
through
local
subsidiaries.
mr.
john
l.
warden
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
approximately
10
or
so
such
statutes
still
in
existence
as
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
as
point
--
yes.
mr.
john
l.
warden
as
pointed
out
in
the
conference
of
state
supervisors'
brief.
mr.
john
l.
warden
there
are
fewer
now
than
there
were
in
years
past.
and
i
might
say
that
in
fain
v.
hall,
a
district
court
decision
in
florida
last
year,
463
f.supp.
661,
the
district
court
struck
down
the
florida
statute
that
limited
to
close
relatives
out-of-state
individuals
who
could
act
as
fiduciaries
in
florida
basing
its
decision
not
on
the
privileges
and
immunities
rights
of
the
fiduciaries
but
on
the
basic
and
fundamental
right
of
the
testator
to
name
his
own
fiduciaries.
mr.
john
l.
warden
yes,
and
that
was
not
appealed
by
the
state.
mr.
john
l.
warden
the
due
process
clause,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
warden
yes.
the
--
the
district
court
said
that
selecting
a
fiduciary
to
manage
one's
property
was
a
fundamental
part
of
human
liberty
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
john
l.
warden
yes.
it
also
found
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
a
classification,
an
arbitrary
one
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
correct.
that
was
the
holding.
mr.
john
l.
warden
659.141,
they
would
have
to
reach,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
because
that
--
that
covers
both
business,
investment
advisory
and
trust
and
of
its
own
force
considered
apart
from
660.10,
keeps
bankers
trust
from
doing
business
in
florida
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
in
any
form.
mr.
john
l.
warden
no,
no,
no,
no.
i
beg
your
pardon.
prevents
their
maintaining
a
local
office.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
warden
yes.
mr.
john
l.
warden
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
preclude
their
using
the
telephone
or
sending
people
down
by
airplane.
mr.
john
l.
warden
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
660.10
does
that.
mr.
john
l.
warden
no,
it
has
been
stipulated
that
but
for
659.141
and
660.10
if
considered
of
its
own
force
to
have
that
effect.
bankers
trust
would
apply
to
--
or
to
incorporate
a
local
subsidiary.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
is
correct
as
to
the
principal
issue
tried
below
which
was
bankers
trust
attempt
to
open
local
offices
in
florida.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
statute
will,
however,
continue
of
its
own
force
to
prevent
bankers
trust's
new
york
operating
subsidiary.
mr.
john
l.
warden
there
is
not,
your
honor.
there
is,
however,
stipulation
that
the
enforcement
of
the
statutes
and
each
of
them
has
caused
bankers
trust
new
york
corporation
economic
injury.
mr.
john
l.
warden
well,
that's
--
that's
the
state
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
stevens.
now,
if
i
may
--
may
proceed
with
the
basic
constitutional
point.
the
statutes
that
florida
here
seeks
to
sustain,
a
fact
on
their
face,
a
simple
economic
protectionism
that
the
court
held
invalid
per
se
two
terms
ago
in
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey.
florida
has
not
sought
by
these
statutes
to
regulate
bank
holding
companies
in
a
way
that
is
evenhanded
on
its
face
but
in
operation
discriminates
against
interstate
firms.
the
so-called
regulation
here
in
issue
affects
only
firms
not
based
in
florida,
and
it
does
not
regulate
them.
it
prohibits
them
absolutely
from
providing
the
services
in
question
in
florida.
the
exxon
case
upon
which
the
opponents
place
their
principal
reliance
simply
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
commerce
clause
allows
a
state
to
exclude
some
but
not
all
out-of-state
firms
as
out-of-state
firms.
the
barrier
in
exxon
was
not
against
interstate
firms
but
against
vertically
integrated
firms,
maryland-based
or
otherwise.
this
court
expressly
noted,
437
u.s.
at
126
that
maryland
statutory
scheme
did
not
"distinguish
between
in-state
and
out-of-state
companies
in
the
retail
market".
florida
statutory
scheme
and
start
contrast
does
nothing
but
distinguish
between
in-state
and
out-of-state
companies
in
these
markets.
florida
has
acted
not
to
preclude
the
doing
of
certain
business
by
bank
holding
companies
but
to
preclude
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies
from
doing
business
in
florida.
secondly,
hughs
against
oklahoma
did
not
overrule
or
limit
philadelphia
against
new
jersey.
it
cited
the
case
with
approval.
and
as
our
brief's
note,
the
first
point
of
the
hughs
three
point
test
incorporates
the
holding
of
philadelphia
and
says
that
at
the
very
least
in
the
case
of
a
statute
discriminating
on
its
face,
the
state
has
the
burden
to
justify
under
strict
scrutiny
a
non-discriminatory
local
purpose
in
the
absence
of
non-discriminatory
alternatives,
florida
has
done
neither.
as
to
the
supposed
need
to
protect
the
people
of
florida
from
some
undefined
menace
of
large
financial
companies,
it
is
sufficient
just
to
say
that
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
even
make
a
pretense
of
doing
so.
mr.
john
l.
warden
it
singles
out
bank
holding
companies.
mr.
john
l.
warden
yes,
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies.
mr.
john
l.
warden
no,
no.
but
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
as
for
our
argument,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
florida
is
required
to
treat
similarly
situated
local
corporations
and
out-of-state
corporations
similarly
unless
it
justifies
under
strict
scrutiny
some
legitimate
non-protectionist
reason
for
doing
so.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
the
statute
there
in
question
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
picked
out
refiners.
this
statute
doesn't
pick
out
bank
holding
companies,
it
picks
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies.
florida
permits
the
holding
company
form
of
commercial
organization
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
entirely
correct
but
the
court
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
a
lesser
included
part
of
the
class
of
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
refiners
and
you're
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
the
entire
class
but
that
needn't
remain
so
in
the
statute
on
its
face
attached
no
significance
to
being
an
interstate
form
or
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
an
out-of-state
form.
mr.
john
l.
warden
non-refiners.
mr.
john
l.
warden
yes,
who
were
permitted
to
continue
to
operate
as
--
as
the
court
said.
as
i
quoted
a
minute
ago,
the
statute
does
not
distinguish
between
in-state
and
out-of-state
dealers
in
the
retail
market.
this
statute
does
distinguish
between
in-state
and
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
on
that
basis.
mr.
john
l.
warden
no.
it's
a
preclusion
of
the
doing
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
l.
warden
the
protection
here
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
is
a
much
stronger
case
for
the
state,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
i
would
submit
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
warden
but
i
would
submit
that
in
such
a
situation,
if
local
banks
were
allowed
to
engage
in
the
trust
and
investment
advisory
businesses,
the
sole
effect
of
such
a
statute
would
be
to
preclude
out-of-state
competition
in
the
trust
and
investment
advisory
businesses
which
congress
has
recognized
are
not
the
business
of
banking
and
therefore
are
not
within
the
consent
it's
given
to
the
states
to
exclude
multi-state
banking.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
warden
well,
there's
--
there's
no
evidentiary
record
to
support
the
contention
that
this
has
a
de
minimis
effect
and
the
state
had
the
--
the
burden
of
establishing
that,
given
the
discrimination
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
but
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
that's
the
commerce
clause
test
under
this
court's
decisions.
i
think
that
the
commerce
clause
requires
the
--
like
in-state
firms
be
treated
the
same
as
like
out-of-state
firms.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
would
have
been
stricken
by
this
court
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
(voice
overlap)
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
warden
now,
the
kind
of
rationalizations
presented
here
by
florida
support
this
statute
were
rejected.
i
hope
once
and
for
all,
when
mr.
justice
cardozo
said
in
baldwin
against
g.
a.
f.
seelig,
294
u.s.
at
523
“to
give
entrance
to
that
excuse
would
be
to
invite
a
speedy
end
of
our
national
solidarity”.
the
constitution
was
framed
under
the
dominion
of
a
political
philosophy
less
parochial
in
range.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
contention
that
congress
has
consented
to
this
discrimination.
the
meaning
of
section
3
(d)
is
clear
on
its
face.
that's
the
first
of
the
provisions
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
to
which
dean
griswold
referred.
it
precludes
acquisition
by
holding
companies
of
banks
across
state
lines
absent
affirmative
legislative
consent
by
the
affected
state.
in
section
2
(c)
of
the
act,
congress
has
defined
a
bank
in
accordance
with
common
understanding
to
be
an
institution
that
accepts
demand
deposits
and
makes
commercial
loans.
mr.
john
l.
warden
at
section
2
(c)
of
the
public
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
bank
holding
company
act.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
going
to
be
--
i
haven't
printed
it
in
there.
mr.
john
l.
warden
sorry.
that
wasn't
printed
as
one
of
the
statutes
involved
in
the
appendix
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
--
is
printed
at
pages
15
and
16
of
our
brief
on
the
merits
of
december
19,
the
yellow
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
brief.
i
believe
you
have
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
the
appellees'
brief
there.
mr.
john
l.
warden
this
is
at
the
clearing
house
brief
at
pages
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
15
and
16.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
now,
this
case,
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
doesn't
involve
the
organization
or
acquisition
of
a
bank
by
anyone,
anywhere.
indeed,
that
definition
was
amended
by
the
congress
in
1966
to
read
as
it
--
well
not
quite
as
it
now
reads.
it
was
amended
again
in
1970
but
it
was
specifically
amended
in
1966
to
remove
non-deposit
trust
companies,
which
is
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
it
never
included
investment
advisory
organizations.
and
the
reason
it
was
removed
--
and
it
was
amended
to
remove
non-deposit
trust
companies,
as
stated
in
the
senate
report
on
the
1966
amendments
at
page
7
as
follows,
“the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
restrain
undue
concentration
of
control
of
commercial
bank
credit
and
to
prevent
abuse
by
holding
company
of
its
control
over
this
type
of
credit.”
then
paraphrasing,
the
certain
institutions
which
are
included
now
need
not
be
included
to
achieve
that
objective,
therefore,
we
are
redefining
bank
to
exclude
institutions
like
non-deposit
trust
companies.
now,
i
see
that
my
time's
up.
i
have
two
brief
additional
points,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
l.
warden
thank
you.
section
4
to
which
dean
griswold
referred
confers
no
powers
on
any
state.
that
is
a
section
that
confers
on
the
federal
reserve
board,
the
power
to
improve
transaction
such
as
the
one
that
bankers
trust
wishes
to
engage
in.
section
7,
on
which
he
also
relies,
is
on
its
face,
a
negation
of
affirmative
preemption.
it
is
not
a
consent
to
the
exercise
of
otherwise
unconstitutional
state
legislative
powers.
it
says
this
act
shall
not
be
construed
or
preempted.
it
doesn't
say
the
commerce
clause
shall
not
be
construed.
mr.
john
l.
warden
florida
is
empowered
under
this
--
under
the
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
bank
holding
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
yes.
in
fact
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
a
holding
company
is
a
bank
holding
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
company
only
because
it
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
owns
a
bank.
mr.
john
l.
warden
but
congress
has
in
the
bank
holding
company
act
given
not
just
to
consent
to
such
state
legislation,
it
has
itself
affirmatively
declared.
mr.
john
l.
warden
but
it
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
that's
right.
with
--
no
--
no
--
no.
congress
has
already
affirmatively
prohibited
multi-state
bank
acquisitions
by
bank
holding
companies
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
absent
an
affirmative
state
legislative
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
consent
to
that
action.
mr.
john
l.
warden
for
--
as
far
as
the
business
of
banking
is
concerned
--
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
congress
has
not
granted
that
permission
as
far
as
any
other
business
is
concerned.
mr.
john
l.
warden
--
mr.
justice
white.
thank
you.
