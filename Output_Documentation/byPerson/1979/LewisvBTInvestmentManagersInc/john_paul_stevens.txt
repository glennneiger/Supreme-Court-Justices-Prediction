justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
griswold,
before
you
leave
the
statutes,
may
i
--
do
i
correctly
understand
that
659.141
would
prohibit
the
formation
of
a
subsidiary
to
engage
in
the
investment
advisory
business,
whereas
660.11
would
permit
an
out-of-state
bank
to
own
a
local
subsidiary
if
it's
provided.
we
got
a
florida
charter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
some
question
as
to
whether
we
really
have
to
decide
anything
about
660.
--
the
second
statute
because
i
don't
see
that
they
ever
tried
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
griswold,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
exxon
case?
there,
the
state
at
least
asserted
the
reason
whether
one
agrees
with
it
or
not
for
discriminating
against
the
refiners
and
ownership.
what
is
the
reason
that
florida
asserts
for
treating
out-of-state
banks
differently
than,
say
paine
webber
or
other
types
of
businesses
that
might
want
to
open
investment
advisory
services,
if
any?
is
there
any
reason
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
--
at
least
the
legislature
had
some
hearings
and
--
and
came
to
a
conclusion
that
ownership
of
retail
stations
by
refiners
gave
rise
to
certain
kinds
of
discrimination
that
they
thought
--
that
the
legislature
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
thought
it
was
bad.
justice
john
paul
stevens
trying
to
protect
local
capital,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
a
greater
danger
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
a
greater
danger
of
the
outflow
of
money
from
florida
if
the
investment
advisory
service
is
owned
by
paine
webber
rather
than
some
big
bank?
i
don't
see
the
difference.
i
don't
see
how
your
explanation
justifies
that
kind
of
a
distinction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
warden,
if
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
district
court
was
correct
in
holding
659.141
unconstitutional,
why
would
we
have
to
go
ahead
and
assume
--
assume
we
agreed
with
them
just
for
purposes
of
discussion,
would
--
would
we
still
have
to
go
ahead
and
consider
the
other
statute,
and
if
so,
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
why
should
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
the
federal
court
assume
--
you
know,
you
certainly
don't
strain
to
give
the
statute
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
unconstitutional
reading.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
warden,
can
i
still
--
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled
about
the
two
--
the
two
statutes.
assuming
we
hold
the
first
statute
from
the
district
court
on
the
first
statute,
has
the
second
statute
hurt
your
--
because
--
your
client,
i
mean
the
--
the
appellee
here
in
anyway
because
they
haven't
tried
to
form
a
subsidiary
or
have
they?
in
entering
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
--
and
if
we
read
660.10
the
way
you
suggest
the
plain
language
indicates,
there's
no
harm
to
the
client,
no
reason
to
reach
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
which
says
you've
got
to
be
locally
incorporated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
evidence
they've
ever
tried
to
do
anything
themselves,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that's
enough
to
require
us
to
face
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that
says
in
order
to
engage
in
trust
business,
you
got
to
be
locally
chartered?
i
--
well
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
your
argument
is
valid,
a
state
which
did
not
permit
bank
holding
company
type
of
operation
could
do
what
florida
is
trying
to
do
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
--
if
i
understood
mr.
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
mr.
griswold
correctly,
so
what
you
should
look
at
is
not
just
out-of-state
banks
or
bank
holding
companies
but
all
out-of-state
concerns
that
want
to
enter
the
investment
advisory
service
market.
and
as
in
--
in
exxon,
you
look
at
the
whole
investory
side
--
advisory
service
market
and
say
keeping
out
a
few
new
york
banks
isn't
going
to
--
its
no
proof
that
will
affect
that
market
because
there's
paine
webber
and
others
who
may
come
in.
if
i
--
that's
what
i
understood
his
argument.
