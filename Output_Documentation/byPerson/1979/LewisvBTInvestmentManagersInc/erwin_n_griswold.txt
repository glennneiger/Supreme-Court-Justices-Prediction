mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
florida.
it
is
a
constitutional
case
in
the
commerce
clause
area
relating
to
banks,
involves
specifically
the
validity
of
two
florida
statutes
dully
enacted
by
the
florida
legislature,
designed
to
prevent
activities
in
florida
by
subsidiaries
of
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies.
the
first
of
these
statutes
is
section
659.141
of
the
florida
statutes
as
amended
effective
in
december
1972.
this
is
set
out
in
full
in
appendix
a
at
the
close
of
the
appellant's
brief.
that's
the
red
brief.
the
appendices
are
separately
paginated
but
i
think
it
can
be
easily
found
at
the
beginning
of
appendix
a.
the
part
which
is
relevant
in
this
case
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
section,
on
the
first
half
of
page
a1,
except
it's
provided
in
subsection
3
“no
bank,
trust
company,
or
holding
company,
the
operations
of
which
are
principally
conducted
outside
the
state,
shall
acquire,
retain,
or
own
directly
all
or
substantially
all
the
assets
of,
or
control
over,
any
bank
or
trust
company
having
a
place
of
business
in
the
state
where
the
business
of
banking
or
trust
business
or
functions
are
conducted.”
that's
the
first
part.
“any
bank
or
trust
company,
or
acquire,
retain
or
own
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
assets
of
or
control
over
any
business
organization
having
a
place
of
business
in
the
state,
where
or
from
which
it
furnishes
investment
advisory
services
in
the
state.”
now,
that
statute
was
amended
in
1972,
the
reading
in
its
present
form.
prior
to
that,
it
had
been
applicable
only
to
the
rendering
of
investment
services
to
banks,
but
the
restriction
of
the
banks
was
taken
out
in
december
1972.
it
will
be
seen
that
this
bars
an
out-of-state
bank
holding
company
from
one
owning
any
bank
or
trust
company,
having
a
place
of
business
in
the
state.
and
it
also
bars
an
out-of-state
bank
holding
company
from
owning
a
subsidiary
having
a
place
of
business
in
florida
from
which
it
furnishes
investment
advisory
services.
the
second
of
the
florida
statute
is
section
660.10.
and
that
is
in
appendix
b
at
the
close
of
the
appellant's
red
covered
brief
and
the
essential
part
of
it
is
that,
“no
one
except
a
bank
and
trust
company
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
the
state
and
having
trust
powers,
except
the
national
bank
located
in
the
state
and
having
trust
powers,
can
exercise
any
of
the
following
powers
which
include
acting
as
executive,
guardian,
trustee,
trustee
in
various
situations,
receiver
assignee,
fiscal
agent
and
so
on,
debarring
anybody
but
florida
corporations
from
conducting
the
trust
business
in
florida.”
you'll
see
that
fits
in
with
the
corresponding
provision
in
the
other
section.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not,
not
at
all.
it's
only
applicable,
an
individual
would
have
to
incorporate
in
florida
but
he
--
he
could
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
--
he
--
well,
i
have
to
read
the
--
the
language
of
the
statute
to
see
just
how
it
applies
to
an
individual.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
--
and
section
660.10,
and
i've
been
looking
at
it,
is
plainly
applicable
only
to
--
to
corporations.
it
does
not
apply
to
individuals
and
you
could
have
private
individuals
acting
as
trustees
in
--
in
florida
in
the
trust
business.
and
the
section
has
no
relation
to
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
far
as
the
florida
statute
is
concerned,
it
--
it
would.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
other
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
--
i
agree
with
you
entirely,
mr.
justice,
however,
the
court
below
did
grant
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
659.141
and
entered
a
declaration
that
section
660.10
was
unconstitutional.
if
either
of
those
stand,
the
result
is
essentially
the
same
with
respect
to
trust
companies.
but
i
think
the
operative
statute
is
659.141.
the
court
below
held
that,
first
to
the
statutes,
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
trust
and
investment
advisory
services
as
an
interference
with
interstate
commerce.
in
the
court's
words,
“this
parochial
legislation
must
be
deemed
per
se
unconstitutional.”
it
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
except
as
to
the
ownership
of
banks.
it
also
gave
a
declaratory
judgment
that
section
660.10
is
invalid
as
violative
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
they've
been
--
been
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
they
went
back
and
they
then
decided
the
case.
it's
our
contention
that
neither
of
these
florida
statutory
provisions
violates
the
commerce
clause
as
understanding
of
the
effect
of
that
clause
has
been
developed
in
the
teachings
of
this
court.
as
this
court
recently
said
in
its
decision
in
hughes
against
oklahoma
just
last
april,
the
case
as
defining
a
scope
of
permissible
state
regulation
in
areas
of
congressional
silence,
reflect
an
often
controversial
evaluation
of
rules
to
accommodate
federal
and
state
interest.
and
that
is
what
we
have
involved
in
this
case.
the
cases
show
that
for
the
purposes
of
applying
the
commerce
clause
as
a
limitation
on
state
power,
the
definition
of
interstate
commerce
while
broad
is
not
without
limits.
one
of
the
cases
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief
is
united
states
against
the
oregon
state
medical
society
which
found
that
local
personal
services
were
not
interstate
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
the
claim
involved
in
that
case.
similarly,
i
would
point
out
that
this
case
does
not
involve
movement
of
goods
across
state
lines
as
in
philadelphia
against
new
jersey,
the
case
upon
which
the
court
below
primarily
relied,
or
in
hughes
against
oklahoma,
nor
does
it
involve
any
restrictions
on
the
means
of
transportation
of
goods,
such
as
railroads
or
trucking
companies
or
airlines.
in
this
case,
the
subject
of
commerce
is
the
provision
of
a
personal
service
on
a
local
basis.
the
next
is
with
interstate
commerce,
is
much
less
obvious
and
proof
of
the
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
is
required
before
a
straight
--
state
restriction
can
be
struck
down.
but
there
is
no
such
showing
of
a
substantial
adverse
effect
on
interstate
commerce
here.
no
direct
evidence
of
any
sort
was
presented
on
that
matter
in
the
trial
court.
the
case
was
tried
entirely
on
a
stipulation
which
is
set
out
in
full
text
on
pages
22
to
25
of
the
appendix.
the
court
below
hypothesized
the
necessary
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
the
court
expressly
acknowledged
that
there
was
no
direct
evidence
of
that
effect
in
this
case.
the
appellees
were
the
plaintiffs
in
the
court
below,
and
it
is
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
conclude
that
they
have
met
their
burden
of
proof
on
this
element.
we
have
discussed
a
number
of
cases
in
our
brief
but
the
case
which
is
closest
to
this,
i
believe,
is
the
decision
two
years
ago
in
exxon
corporation
against
the
governor
of
maryland.
it's
appropriate,
i
think,
to
point
out
that
the
court
below
didn't
even
discuss
the
exxon
case.
it
didn't
even
cite
it
in
its
opinion,
though
it
is,
i
think,
clearly
the
closest
case.
it
involved
a
maryland
statute
which
prohibited
all
producers
and
refiners
of
petroleum
products
from
operating
retail
service
stations
in
maryland
or
from
discriminating
between
customers
in
maryland.
now,
there
are
no
producers
or
refiners
of
petroleum
products
in
maryland
which
everyone
knew.
it
is
suggested
in
the
other
side
of
the
brief
here
that
this
statute
is
bad
because
it
is
discriminatory
on
its
phase
whereas
the
maryland
--
maryland
statute
was
not.
but
this
court
said
in
the
hughes
against
oklahoma
case
last
spring,
that
a
statute
must
be
determined
as
to
whether
it
is
discriminatory
on
its
face
or
in
its
operation
and
effect.
and
the
impact
of
the
statute
in
the
exxon
case
was
entirely
on
out-of-state
refiners
and
producers
which
operated
service
stations
in
maryland.
this
court
noted
that
statute
did
not
totally
block
interstate
marketers
of
petroleum
from
--
from
entering
the
maryland
market
and
this
statute
does
not
totally
block
extra
state
corporations,
individuals,
businesses,
other
than
banks
and
bank
holding
companies
from
entering
the
--
the
florida
market.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
new
york
bank
can't
enter
the
market
under
the
--
under
the
paine,
webber,
jackson
&
curtis
can
open
an
office
and
give
investment
advice
in
new
york.
standard
&
poor's
which
puts
out
much
investment
service
can
open
an
office
and
give
investment
advice
in
new
york.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
anyone
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
any
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
so
are
paine,
webber
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
quite
true.
the
effect
of
this
statute
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
either
directly
or
--
or
through
a
subsidiary,
they
cannot
enter
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
this
--
this
investment
advice
or
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
other
part
of
the
statute
means
they
cannot
act
as
a
--
as
a
trustee.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
often
includes
giving
investment
advice.
as
in
exxon,
the
statute
here
does
not
prohibit
the
interstate
movement
of
articles
or
goods.
it
doesn't
prohibit
the
flow
of
fiduciary
services
into
or
out
of
florida.
it
limits
in-state
outlets
when
owned
by
out-of-state
banks,
trust
companies
and
holding
companies
just
as
the
maryland
statute
in
exxon,
barred
in-state
outlets
only
to
produces
and
refiners
all
of
which
were
out
of
state.
similarly,
section
660.10
by
itself
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
it
is
--
it
is
--
it
wasn't
too
clear
in
exxon.
it
was
asserted
but
there
were
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
other
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
think
it
is
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
i
think
it
is
the
--
the
problem
that
all
of
the
states
have
had
over
the
years
of
trying
to
find
a
way
to
maintain,
control
over
their
own
banking
and
economic
facilities
in
such
a
way
that
their
assets
will
not
be
drawn
away
by
out-of-state
operations.
the
states
be
led
while
the
money
goes
elsewhere.
it
is
--
it
is
in
very
large
measure
a
--
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
protect
local
citizens,
protect
local
people
who
may
want
to
borrow
money
to
buy
houses
and
find
the
money
as
going
to
be
lent
on
the
euro
or
dollar
market
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
with
very
high
rates
of
interest.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
whole
--
the
--
the
history
of
this
country
is
filled
for
150
years
of
the
struggle
between
national
banking
and
local
banking.
i
think
the
history
book
show
that
a
chief
justice
of
this
court
attained
prominence
because
he
supported
president
jackson
in
opposition
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
maryland
to
the
operations
of
the
bank
of
the
united
states.
this
is
part
of
that
same
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
correct.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
both
give
investment
advice
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
so
far
as
i
can
see.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
it's
not
--
it
doesn't
have
an
office
in
florida
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
can
do
it
by
mail
or
telephone,
and
they
can
send
representatives
into
the
state,
as
long
as
they
don't
open
an
office
and
conduct
business
in
the
state.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
--
not
without
complying
with
section
660.10
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
means
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
to
be
--
to
be
becoming
incorporated
in
florida.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it's
appropriate
now
to
--
to
move
on
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
case
which
is
the
fact
that
we
have
two
strings
to
our
bow.
i've
tried
to
argue
so
far
that
under
exxon,
there
is
not
interstate
commerce
here,
which
is
adversely
affected
by
this
statute,
sufficiently
to
require
the
result
reached
below.
but
there
are
two
federal
statutes
which
are
directly
relevant.
these
federal
statutes
are
important
not
only
because
of
the
text
of
their
provisions
but
also
because
they
represent
important
policy
determinations
made
by
congress
which
are
relevant
in
determining
the
validity
of
the
florida
statutes
here
involved.
they
show
that
congress
made
clear
choices
in
this
area,
and
this
should
not
be
frustrated
by
opening
the
doors
to
miners
and
sappers,
to
use
in
historical
phrase,
in
the
form
of
the
devices
involved
here
which,
if
allowed,
and
if
allowed
here
soon
extended,
will
enable
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies
to
do
much
of
what
they
have
been
specifically
forbidden
to
do
by
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
haven't
the
slightest
idea,
mr.
justice.
they
--
there
isn't
any
question
of
reciprocity
involved
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
--
but
the
fact
here
is
involving
control
by
a
state
over
admission
to
the
bar,
it
seems
to
me,
are
historically
and
otherwise
different
factors
in
those
involved
in
the
admission
of
foreign
incorporations
to
do
business
in
the
state,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
federal
statutory
provision
to
which
i'm
about
to
refer
to.
the
first
to
these
statutes
was
the
mcfadden
act
which
was
passed
in
1927,
more
than
50
years
ago.
it
relates
to
national
banks,
but
it
says
that
national
banks
cannot
have
branches
in
a
--
a
state
except
to
the
extent
that
state
banks
can
have
branches
in
the
state.
and
it
also
prevents
interstate
branching
of
national
banks
because
branches
whereby
that
statute
limited
to
states
within
which
the
national
bank
was
situated.
but
pressure
to
reach
out
is
always
found
in
the
banking
area.
that
indeed
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
in
due
course,
the
effect
of
these
limitations
on
banking
including
the
limitations
and
the
laws
of
most
of
the
states
led
to
the
development
of
a
new
expensive
device
and
thus,
to
a
vast
growth
in
the
use
of
bank
holding
companies.
by
creating
a
corporation
to
own
multiple
banks,
it
was
possible
to
avoid
limitations
on
branching
not
only
in
intrastate
but
across
state
lines
across
many
state
lines.
it
was
to
deal
with
this
problem
that
congress
passed
the
bank
holding
company
act
in
1956,
and
it
contains
three
provisions
that
are
relevant
here.
the
first
of
this
is
section
3
(d),
and
that
appears
in
appendix
c
as
12
u.s.c.
1842
(d).
and
it
provides
--
it
--
it
bars
any
bank
holding
company
or
subsidiary
from
acquiring
any
additional
bank
located
outside
of
the
state
where
the
holding
company's
banking
subsidiaries
are
operating
unless
this
is
expressly
authorized
by
the
outside
state.
and
here,
we
have
the
florida
statute
which
says,
“we
don't
authorize,
just
what's
invited
by
that
provision.”
and
the
second
provision
is
section
4
of
the
bank
holding
company
act,
now
found
in
12
u.s.c.
1843.
it's
in
appendix
d
at
the
close
of
the
appellant's
brief.
the
basic
provision
there
says,
“except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
act,
no
bank
holding
company
shall
acquire
direct
or
indirect
ownership
or
control
of
any
voting
shares
of
any
company
which
is
not
a
bank.”
and
if
it
has
said
that
this
investment
advisory
and
trust
company
services
are
not
banks,
congress
has
said,
“the
out-of-state
holding
company
can't
own
it.”
and
then
finally,
there
at
section
7
of
the
bank
holding
company
act,
which
is
in
appendix
e,
which
broadly
reserved
to
the
states
their
powers
to
regulate
bank
holding
companies
and
their
subsidiaries,
the
last
three
words
are
“and
subsidiaries
thereof”
as
long
as
the
state
regulation
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
acts
of
congress.
now,
thus,
the
basic
federal
statutory
scheme
maybe
stated
very
simply.
“no
bank
holding
company
may
own
a
bank
outside
the
home
state
without
the
outside
state's
expressed
permission.”
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
too
difficult
to
construe
this
to
apply
to
bits
and
pieces
of
banks,
particularly
when
they
are
owned
by
a
bank
holding
company
and
are
so
closely
related
to
managing
or
controlling
banks
as
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereof
as
the
federal
board
--
reserve
board
has
determined.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
first,
i
would
like
to
make
a
brief
further
answer
to
what
in
effect
were
two
questions
closely
related
from
justice
stevens.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
question
of
who
makes
a
sale
or
what
business
is
done.
this
case
involves
an
aspect
of
federalism.
the
difference
between
paine
webber
and
the
appellee
here
is
that
the
appellee
is
a
bank,
a
bank
holding
company.
and
the
whole
history
of
this
country
for
200
years
shows
a
constant
struggle
on
the
highest
political
level
to
maintain
the
position
of
the
states
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
money.
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
this
is
--
both
the
congress
and
the
states
have
passed
legislation
in
this
area
over
many
years,
and
the
statutes
which
are
involved
here
are
statutes
of
that
type.
now,
i
was
referring
to
the
particular
provisions
in
the
bank
holding
company
act.
the
first
one
of
which
is
that
a
bank
holding
company
cannot
own
a
bank
in
a
state
unless
the
state
says
it
can.
the
second
one
is
that
no
bank
holding
company
may
--
may
own
any
company
which
is
not
a
bank,
and
these
things
are
not
banks,
this
investment
advisory
and
it's
strange
to
say,
the
trust
business
is
not
a
bank.
and
then,
there
comes
--
well,
through
these
provisions,
congress
has
formulated
a
national
policy
in
this
area.
this
case
would
never
have
arisen
were
it
not
for
an
exception
to
section
4
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
which
is
in
12
u.s.c.
1843
(c)
(8)
and
is
printed
on
page
d2,
appendix
d
of
the
appellant's
brief,
and
it
says,
“hence,
such
prohibition
shall
not,
with
respect
to
any
other
bank
holding
company,
apply
to
shares
of
any
company
the
activities
of
which
the
board,”
that's
the
federal
reserve
board,
“after
new
notice,
an
opportunity
for
hearing
has
determined
by
order
or
regulation
to
be
so
closely
related
to
banking
or
managing
or
controlling
banks
as
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereto.”
now,
the
appellees
contend
that
in
substance
by
this
exception,
congress
has
undone
much
of
which
--
what
it
so
clearly
did
and
intended
to
do
in
the
basic
parts
of
the
very
same
statute.
i
do
not
think
that
this
exception
needs
to
be
construed
or
should
be
construed
to
authorize
any
such
result
to
authorize
in
effect
the
introduction
of
a
new
cutting
edge
of
expansion
from
outside
the
state
when
the
whole
tenure
of
the
statute,
in
its
history,
shows
that
the
basic
policy
choice
made
by
congress
was
to
protect
the
states
from
expansion
by
outside
bank
holding
companies
except
to
the
extent
that
the
state
chose
to
authorize
such
expansion.
the
basic
policies
established
by
congress
are
clear,
no
bank
outside
the
state,
no
subsidiary
which
is
not
a
bank.
this
gives
color
to,
and
helps
to
define
the
scope
of
the
exemption
given
in
(c)
(8).
to
use
the
words
used
by
the
court
in
another
text,
this
basic
--
another
context,
these
basic
prohibitory
provisions
provide
emanations
and
a
penumbra
which
helped
to
determine
the
intent
of
congress
which
was
expressed
in
(c)
(8).
my
suggestion
is
that
(c)
(8)
can
be
given
full
scope
and
effect
by
construing
it
to
have
a
territorial
limitation,
that
(c)
(8)
authorizes
the
board
to
authorize
a
bank
holding
company
to
own
a
corporation
which
is
not
a
bank
to
provide
services
to
the
bank
holding
company
in
a
state
where
the
bank
holding
company
is
authorized
to
own
a
bank.
but
that
it
should
not
be
construed
in
a
wide
open
way
to
authorize
the
bank
holding
company
to
proceed
in
the
other
states
--
all
other
states
without
a
limitation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
board
has
not
--
the
--
the
board
considered
this
case
up
to
the
point
where
florida
passed
the
statue
and
then
the
board
said
because
florida
says,
”we
can't
go
there.
we
will
not
authorize
it.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
they
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
the
board
has
authorized
some
bank
holding
companies
to
have
this
type
of
subsidiary
outside
the
state.
i'm
contending
the
board
was
wrong.
i
know
of
no
judicial
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
might
do
it
in
the
state
which
didn't
prevent
it.
that
would
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
it
did
it
in
a
state
which
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
would
say
that
they
--
they
were,
but
i
would
also
say
that
the
board
has
no
power
under
this
statute
if
properly
construed
because
the
statute
ought
to
be
construed
to
authorize
the
board
to
allow
the
subsidiary
assisting
factors
only
in
states
where
the
bank
holding
company
needs
those
factors
in
order
to
carry
out
its
banking
business
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
in
those
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
--
its
--
there
never
has
been
a
clear
administrative
construction
by
way
of
decision
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
--
i
think
that
in
those
cases
where
the
board
has
authorized
this
outside
of
the
state
where
there
is
a
bank
that
properly
considered
judicial
authority,
i
might
hold
that
the
board
was
wrong.
as
justice
cardozo
said
in
the
panama
refining
case,
“the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
to
be
looked
for
not
in
any
single
section
but
in
all
the
parts
together
and
then
their
relation
to
the
end
in
view.”
and
i
would
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
recent
case
of
(inaudible)
against
boyle
involving
jurisdiction
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
the
--
this
court
did
exactly
that,
yet
applied
a
--
a
territorial
limitation
to
a
statute
which
was
otherwise
quite
clear.
accordingly,
we
think
that
the
judgement
below
was
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
