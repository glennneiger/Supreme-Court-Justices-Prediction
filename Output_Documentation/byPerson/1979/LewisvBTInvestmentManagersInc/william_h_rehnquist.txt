justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
griswold,
do
you
think
that
the
effect
of
these
statutes
would
bar
an
individual
who
did
not
wish
to
limit
his
liability
from
going
into
florida
and
rendering
this
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
he
didn't
want
to
incorporate
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
--
i
was
looking
at
page
82
of
your
appendix
and
on
section
2
there
it
says,
“referring
to
the
business
organization
control
in
any
manager
in
any
manner
of
the
election
of
a
majority,
the
directors,
or
trustees
of
the
bank,
trust,
or
holding
company.”
and
then
section
1
before
that
says,
“the
business
organization
directly
or
indirectly
acting
to
one
or
more
person's
own
controls
as
part
about
25%
of
all
the
shares
of
any
class
of
voting
security.”
so
those
--
now,
that
language
to
me
connotes
a
corporation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
had
originally
abstained,
had
it
not?
and
then
been
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
griswold,
before
you
move
on.
well,
what
would
the
district
court's
decision
here
do
to
the
general
provisions
in
all
of
the
sunbelt
states
denying
reciprocity
of
admission
to
the
bar?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
a
common
fact
that
the
sunbelt
states
simply
refused
to
admit
on
--
on
reciprocity
where
the
most
of
the
other
states
don't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
there's
no
need
for
administrative
expertise,
you
mean
you
don't
rely
in
any
preemption
doctrine
under
the
bank
holding
company
act,
you
simply
rely
on
what
--
or
what
are
called
reversed
commerce
clauses
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
the
commerce
clause
itself
simply
grants
congress
the
authority
to
rate
late
commerce
among
the
several
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
lot
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
florida
courts
have
never
had
an
opportunity
to
interpret
the
law.
the
district
court
originally
abstained
and
you
appealed
saying
they
shouldn't
have
abstained.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
--
to
say
that
florida
hasn't
yet
conceded,
very,
very
likely
the
executive
branch
in
florida
or
the
people
representing
the
state
banking
authorities
aren't
in
a
position
to
make
a
final
determination.
that's
for
the
florida
courts,
i
would
think
if
its
--
florida's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
--
what
can
a
prior
constitutional
provision
did
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
district
court
rely
on
in
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
--
what,
life,
liberty,
property?
