how
do
you
enter
the
florida
market
into
these
statutes?
how
would
a
new
york
bank
enter
the
florida
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
bank
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
banks
and
trust
companies,
especially
trust
companies
who
are
usually
in
the
business
of
giving
investment
advice
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
can't
--
they
can't
enter
the
market
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
--
yes,
but
in
any
--
in
any
way,
they
can't
enter
the
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
either
through
a
subsidiary
or
directly.

investment

white
market.
and
--
and
that
--
that
also
means
they
can't
act
as
a
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
--
and
that
--
that
normally
includes
giving
investment
advice.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
bank
--
a
bank
is
kept
out
of
florida
but
an
investment
banker
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
both
give
investment
advice
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mr.
--
would
this
--
you
--
would
--
would
this
statute
--
under
the
statute,
could
a
bank,
could
a
florida
bank,
acting
as
a
trustee
and
--
and
giving
investment
services,
could
it
buy
some
investment
advice
from
a
new
york
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
i've
--
i've
--
then
there
was
a
new
york
bank
doing
business
in
florida
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
selling
investment
advice.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
--
you
mean
under
the
statute,
new
york
banks
may
give
investment
advice
to
florida
citizens?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they're
acting
--
they
may
--
could
they
act
as
trustee
of
assets
located
in
florida?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
have
a
corporation.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
basis
--
is
that
the
construction
the
board
put
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
that's
your
position.
isn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.but
the
board
might
have
--
might
do
this
in
a
state
that
didn't
prevent
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
if
it
didn't
in
the
state
that
did
prevent
it,
it
was
right.
you
would
--
you
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
would
say
the
board
was
quite
right
in
--
in
denying
permission
here
because
florida
prevented
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
so
you're
disagreeing
with
the
administrative
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
you
thought
the
board
was
wrong
a
moment
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
say
--
i
--
i
suppose
you
will
get
to
it
but
what
would
you
say
the
board's
error
was
in
denying
permission
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
the
board
also
--
or
--
or
did
it
or
perhaps
it
didn't.
you
don't
think
there's
any
element
in
the
board's
decision
that
--
to
the
effect
that
congress
consented
to
this
florida's
--
the
kind
of
florida
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
if
the
congress
permitted
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
--
i
just
want
to
clear
up
one
more
--
one
more
point.
do
you
think
the
board
has
--
has
addressed
that
either
way
the
question
of
congressional
consent
in
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so,
you
don't
--
you
can't
relay
on
board
construction
that
there
is
no
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know
you
--
i
know
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
might
be
lesser
included
offenses
though,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
but
they're
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they're
not
unrelated
to
banking.
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise,
it
may
be
--
your
clients
wouldn't
be
interested.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
suggestion
that
--
that
we
wouldn't
know
more
about
the
florida
law
than
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
better
than
--
better
than
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
suggesting
you
should
lose
on
that
part
of
the
case?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'd
--
i'd
--
perhaps
i
understood
dean
griswold
that
--
didn't
he
suggest
that
this
statute
didn't
prevent
an
outside
executive
from
himself
doing
business
across
the
state
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
--
i'll
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
speaks
for
himself
or
rely
on
the
transcript.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
660.10
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
that
--
if
that
provision
had
been
construed
to
permit
out-of-state
corporations
directly
to
give
investment
advice
in
a
state
either
through
a
local
office
or
--
or
without
a
local
office
on
the
telephone
or
by
mail,
the
district
court
might
have
had
a
different
idea
about
an
--
the
--
about
the
other
statute
because
there
might
be
a
way
where
--
that
this
wouldn't
--
if
they
could
be
business
this
way,
it
wouldn't
be
so
burdensome
under
state
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suggest
that
--
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
district
court
had
--
had
stricken
down
660.10
and
then
said,
“we
needn't
reach
the
other
section,”
would
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
because
that
caused
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
--
in
any
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
across
state
line
by
telephone,
by
letter?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
right.
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
could
still
do
business
across
a
state
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
that
section
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
acting
as
trustee.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
statutes
single
out
banks
at
least
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly
but
it
doesn't
single
out
other
kinds
of
out-of-state
companies,
holding
companies
or
otherwise.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
in
exxon,
out-of-state
--
out-of-state
companies
that
weren't
refiners
but
who
are
engaged
in
the
distribution
of
gasoline,
could
own
local
stations?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
only
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
pick
out
refiners.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
matter
just
so
happened
that
every
--
possibly,
weren't
any
local
refiners
in
maryland.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
just
picked
out
out-of-state
refiners?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
included
in
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
a
regulation
of
banking
and
the
sense
--
because
it
doesn't
affect
local
banks.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
--
do
you
say
that
in
exxon,
if
maryland
had
said
local
refiners,
if
there
were
some,
may
own
stations
but
out
of
--
out-of-state
refiners
may
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
this
case.
that's
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
--
where
are
you
reading?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
--
is
that
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
is
that
appendix
c
or
d
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
section
please.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggested
it
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
i
got
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
you're
not
an
appellee.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
also
a
standard
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
if
this
--
if
--
if
the
holding
company
here,
if
the
new
york
holding
company
had
wanted
to
acquire
a
bank
in
florida,
you
would
agree
florida
could
keep
it
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
if
florida
holding
companies
may
own
banks?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
and
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
so
--
so
that
--
so
florida
may
--
has
a
choice
of
either
discriminating
against
foreign
holding
companies
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
state
law
permits
--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
florida
--
florida
could
permit
it
or
it
may
prevent
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
--
