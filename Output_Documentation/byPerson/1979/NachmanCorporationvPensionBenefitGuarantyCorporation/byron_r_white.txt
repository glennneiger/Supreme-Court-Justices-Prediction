justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gettleman,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
while
you
are
going
through
the
plan
here
because
it
may
bear
on
what
you
are
saying.
supposing
the
termination
occurred
a
year
later,
in
january
of
1977,
and
at
that
time
i
would
suppose
there
would
still
be
the
same
provisions
in
the
trust
agreement
to
the
pension
plan
and
it
would
still
be
unfunded,
some
of
the
benefits
would
not
be
funded.
would
the
insurance
coverage
apply
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
would
have
required
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
be
making
your
same
argument
between
two
plans
if
one
is
terminated
the
day
before
the
deadline
and
one
is
terminated
the
day
after,
but
things
are
just
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
relative
burden
on
the
company
is
exactly
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
only
had
a
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
did
this
plan
expire,
during
the
grace
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
still
saying
there
is
a
difference
between
the
day
before
the
grace
period
is
over
and
the
day
after?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gettleman,
do
you
suppose
when
i
wrote
that
footnote
i
contemplated
the
issue
that
is
before
us
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
the
proposition,
that
there
are
staggered
dates
in
erisa,
of
course
there
are
a
lot
of
other
staggered
dates
in
erisa.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
make
one
thing
effective
immediately,
mr.
gettleman,
and
that
is
the
insurance
program.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
insure
during
the
period
prior
to
the
date
of
your
termination
of
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
purpose
just
to
insure
against
the
possibility
that
the
money
contributed
to
the
fund
will
have
been
dissipated
or
stolen
by
the
trustees?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
talking
about
the
risk
of
dissipation
of
funds
or
maybe
poor
investments.
what
did
the
insurance
program
insure?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
but
as
applied
to
this
one
it
will
reach
the
same
result
with
either
approach.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
sorry,
could
i
ask
you
one
question.
if
they
are
irrelevant,
isn't
there
an
action
on
the
part
of
the
pbgc
against
the
company?
i
mean
i
just
didn't
quite
follow
that
last
argument.
you
said
that
those
limitation
of
liability
clauses
protect
the
company
and
the
plan
from
direct
action
by
the
beneficiary.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
beneficiary
may
collect
from
pbgc
or
whatever
the
name
of
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
who
in
turn
may
collect
from
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
we
are
addressing
the
question
of
what
good
do
these
limitation
of
liability
clauses
do
the
company.
you
say
the
good
is
it
protects
them
from
a
suit
by
the
employee,
and
my
question
is
what
difference
does
that
make
if
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay
to
the
insurance
corporation
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
the
insurance
isn't
for
the
full
amount
of
the
non-forfeitable
benefit,
it
is
only
for
the
amount
that
the
statute
prescribes
that
it
must
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
difference
between
the
benefit
level
and
the
statutory
mandated
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
two
differences
then.
one
is
that
the
limitation
is
only
30
percent
of
the
assets,
the
net
worth
of
the
company;
and,
secondly,
it
is
a
different
benefit
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
guarantee
is
different
than
the
plan
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
