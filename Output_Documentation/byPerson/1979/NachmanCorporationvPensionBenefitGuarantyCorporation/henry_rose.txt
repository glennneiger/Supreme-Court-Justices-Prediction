mr.
henry
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
submits
that
the
construction
of
the
act
urged
by
the
petitioner
defeats
the
purpose
of
title
iv
of
erisa.
it
would
effectively
destroy
a
major
part
of
the
program.
the
title
iv
program,
as
has
been
indicated,
is
traceable
directly
to
the
closing
of
the
studebaker
plant
in
1964,
where
two-thirds
of
the
participants
lost
almost
all
of
their
pension
benefits.
and
after
a
long
study,
the
congress
decided
to
create
an
insurance
system
to
guaranteed
certain
benefits
to
which
the
employees
would
have
been
entitled
but
for
the
termination
of
the
plan.
the
guarantee
program
is
administered
by
a
new
agency,
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation.
its
board
of
directors
is
made
up
of
the
secretaries
of
labor,
commerce
and
treasury.
the
program
is
financed
primarily
by
premiums
paid
by
all
of
the
plans
that
are
covered
by
the
program.
and
in
order
to
share
the
program
costs
and
to
discourage
unrealistic
pension
promises
by
employers,
there
is
a
statutory
liability
on
employers
who
terminate
plans.
mr.
henry
rose
there
is
no
question
that
there
could
be
such
a
disclaimer.
in
fact,
there
always
has
been
and
they
continue
to
be
almost
universal.
mr.
henry
rose
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
certainly
do.
the
statutory
liability
is
less
severe
than
if
congress
had
made
the
employers
liable
to
the
plans
or
to
the
participants
for
the
benefits
which
the
participants
had
already
become
entitled
to
under
the
plan
terms.
this
liability
is
measured
by
the
unfunded
benefits
that
the
pbgc
guarantees,
and
that
liability
is
to
the
pbgc
and
it
is
limited
to
30
percent
of
the
employer's
net
worth.
the
title
iv
program
is
one
of
three
distinct
programs
under
erisa.
mr.
henry
rose
no,
there
are
other
reasons.
there
are
certain
benefits
that
must
be
phased
in
when
a
benefit
increase
occurs.
and
if
it
hasn't
been
phased
in
for
the
appropriate
amount
of
years,
it
would
not
be
guaranteed.
mr.
henry
rose
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
not
applicable
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
rose
not
as
far
as
i
know.
we
don't
have
those
facts.
mr.
henry
rose
as
far
as
i
know,
that
is
true,
yes.
but
we
are
construing
the
statute
for
a
universe
of
80,000
plans.
this
is
one
of
three
distinct
programs
under
the
umbrella
erisa
and
there
are
three
different
agencies
with
three
different
effective
dates.
in
general,
the
title
iv
program
administered
by
the
pbgc
was
made
effective
immediately,
that
is
september
2,
1974.
the
title
i
and
title
ii
programs
administered
by
the
labor
and
treasury
departments
respectively
had
deferred
effective
dates.
now,
the
congressional
sense
of
urgency
about
getting
the
title
iv
program
under
way
was
so
great
that
they
even
provided
for
the
coverage
of
participants
in
plans
that
terminated
in
the
two
months
preceding
the
date
of
enactment
and
for
that
preenactment
coverage
the
congress
completely
waived
employer
liability.
for
plan
terminations
that
took
place
within
a
nine-month
period
immediately
following
the
date
of
enactment,
the
congress
made
a
special
rule,
that
is
they
authorized
the
pbgc
to
waive
or
reduce
the
employer
liability
upon
a
showing
of
hardship.
now,
congress
knew
that
title
iv
had
to
go
into
effect
immediately
in
order
to
provide
prompt
and
effective
protection
to
the
employees
concerned.
and
since
the
termination
insurance
program
operates
by
statutory
rule
without
the
need
of
plan
amendments,
there
was
no
reason
for
delay.
in
contrast,
the
vesting
standards
and
related
provisions
in
titles
i
and
ii
required
plans
to
make
complex
amendments.
for
example,
there
are
three
permissible
vesting
rules
permitted
by
the
statute
and
plans
must
conform
with
at
least
one
of
them.
congress
deferred
the
effective
date
of
these
provisions
for
16
months
so
that
employers
would
have
an
opportunity
to
study
them
and
make
their
choice
and
to
effect
the
amendments.
the
reasons
for
deferring
these
title
i
provisions
simply
don't
apply
to
title
iv.
the
guarantee
which
is
the
heart
of
title
iv
provides
that
the
corporation
shall
guarantee
the
payment
of
all
non-forfeitable
benefits
subject
to
the
limitations
we
have
discussed.
the
controversy
here
turns
on
the
meaning
of
non-forfeitable.
the
pbgc
adopted
a
definition
in
a
regulation
which
fulfills
the
congressional
objective
to
guarantee
benefits
for
which
employees
had
attained
eligibility
and
would
have
received
but
for
the
termination
of
the
plan.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
substance
of
the
pbgc
definition
but
it
read
it
into
the
definition
of
non-forfeitable
found
in
title
i.
that
reasoning
works
in
this
case
in
order
to
reach
the
right
result,
because
there
is
no
condition
here
on
the
participants
entitled
to
a
benefit,
but
that
approach
might
tragically
deprive
participants
in
other
situations
of
needed
benefits.
mr.
henry
rose
to
this
extent,
yes,
sir.
let
me
illustrate.
disability
benefits
are
normally
conditional
on
continued
disability.
there
is
always
the
--
mr.
henry
rose
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
henry
rose
that's
correct,
it
does
not
make
a
difference
in
this
case,
but
we
are
construing
a
statute
that
has
to
be
applied
to
80,000
other
plans.
mr.
henry
rose
that
is
correct.
in
case
of
disability
benefits
there
is
always
the
possibility
and
hope
of
recovery,
and
if
title
i
definition
were
applied
there
would
be
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
any
disability
benefits
could
be
guaranteeable
under
title
iv;
whereas,
the
pbgc
definition
guarantees
such
benefits
as
we
think
the
congress
intended.
mr.
henry
rose
yes,
i
think
that
is
clear,
justice
rehnquist.
they
did
throughout
the
debates
and
you
will
even
notice
that
where
the
statute
says
unforfeitable
frequently
in
the
conference
report
or
the
committee
report
also
used
the
term
"vested."
it
is
not
necessary
to
take
the
risk
that
benefits
such
as
disability
benefits
will
have
that
result.
it
is
clear
from
the
scheme
of
the
statute
that
it
does
not
call
for
a
rigid
uniformity
of
definition.
the
congress
itself
established
three
separate
definition
sections
in
titles
i,
ii
and
iv.
all
of
the
definitions
in
title
i
including
non-forfeitable
are
expressly
restricted
to
title
i
by
the
statutory
language.
were
congress
wanted
in
title
i
definition
to
apply
in
title
iv,
it
would
have
said
so
explicitly.
for
example,
title
iv
defines
the
word
"administrator"
by
explicit
reference
to
the
title
i
definition
of
"administrator."
in
contrast,
title
iv
does
not
define
the
fundamental
word
"participant."
there
is
such
a
definition
in
title
i.
title
i
defines
"participant"
in
very
broad
terms.
that
is
so
that
an
individual
who
has
a
claim
under
a
plan
will
have
ready
access
to
the
plan
documents,
as
title
i
would
give
him,
and
it
gives
him
standing
to
pursue
that
claim
under
title
i.
now,
that
definition
applied
to
title
iv
simply
doesn't
work.
i
have
already
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
program
is
financed
by
premiums
paid
by
the
plans.
that
premium
is
a
function
of
the
number
of
participants
in
the
plan.
and
in
a
number
of
plans,
the
administrator
has
no
way
of
knowing
how
many
people
might
have
claims
against
that
plan.
congress
did
not
define
"non-forfeitable"
for
title
iv
purposes
and
accordingly
the
pbgc
supplied
its
own.
now,
under
the
title
i
definition,
a
benefit
as
the
petitioner
has
argued
here
just
a
moment
ago,
a
benefit
is
not
forfeitable
only
when
the
claims
of
the
benefit
is
unconditional.
referring
to
its
own
plan
at
page
28
of
its
brief,
petitioner
says
that
the
invested
benefits
were
not
non-forfeitable
since
they
were
conditioned
on
full
funding
and
were
not
in
fact
fully
funded
and
therefore
not
guaranteed.
well,
what
benefits
could
be
guaranteed
under
this
theory
of
fully
funded
benefits?
but
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
there
is
no
need
to
establish
a
new
social
program
through
insurance
in
order
to
pay
benefits
that
the
plan
already
has
the
funds
to
pay.
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
congress
intended
the
guarantee
to
apply
only
in
plans
that
were
not
conditioned
on
full
funding
and
by
that
the
petitioner
means
plans
without
a
limitation
of
liability
clause.
but
virtually
all
plans
have
such
provisions.
the
congress
knew
that
they
did
and
clearly
stated
its
intent
to
soften
the
impact
of
those
clauses
on
employees
through
termination
insurance.
mr.
henry
rose
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
rose
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
was
an
affidavit
filed
to
the
effect
that
78
out
of
136
plans
had
limitation
of
liability
clauses
like
the
one
in
the
petitioner's
plan,
but
that
does
not
mean
that,
as
the
petitioner
would
have
it,
that
the
other
plans
did
not
have
other
language
which
was
just
as
effective
and
accomplished
the
same
purpose.
it
is
just
that
the
--
mr.
henry
rose
well,
at
that
time,
justice
rehnquist,
we
thought
it
was
enough
to
show
that
a
majority
of
the
plans
had
practically
identical
language,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
practically
all
plans
have
similar
language
with
the
same
legal
effect.
in
fact,
the
proposition
that
virtually
all
of
the
pension
plans
have
had
and
continue
to
have
limitation
of
liability
clauses
is
supported
by
the
standard
literature
in
the
field.
it
is
a
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
and
it
is
a
premise
on
which
the
congress
acted.
the
studebaker
plan
had
such
a
class
in
1964
and
the
internal
revenue
service
includes
such
a
clause
in
a
prototype
plan
that
it
issued
in
1977,
and
thousands
of
plans
have
been
established
on
the
basis
of
that
prototype.
therefore,
it
is
true,
as
the
court
of
appeals
observed
below,
that
the
petitioner's
view
would
make
the
enactment
of
title
iv
almost
meaningless.
now,
reference
is
made
to
retroactivity
here.
the
congress
was
very
clear
as
to
when
title
iv
was
to
be
effective,
and
it
was
immediately.
and
the
congress
specified
which
portions
of
the
program
should
have
retroactive
effect
and
which
not.
for
example,
title
iv
certainly
had
retroactive
impact
upon
participants
in
plans
that
terminated
in
the
two
months
preceding
enactment
because
it
made
them
eligible
for
benefits
under
the
program.
as
to
the
imposition
of
employer
liability,
the
congress
was
careful.
it
applied
--
it
imposed
employer
liability
only
on
employers
that
terminated
plans
after
the
date
of
enactment.
now,
it
is
true
that
that
liability
is
measured
in
part
by
service
of
employment
that
took
place
prior
to
the
date
of
enactment,
but
in
that
sense
it
has
a
retroactive
impact.
but
that
kind
of
retroactive
impact
would
be
here
whether
the
effective
date
of
the
employer
liability
was
1974,
1976,
1980,
or
even
later.
let
me
correct
for
the
court
a
couple
of
impressions
that
have
been
left
by
the
petitioner.
reference
has
been
made
that
the
act
requires
after
1976
a
minimum
level
of
benefits.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
that
requires
any
minimum
level
of
benefits.
it
is
not
relevant
to
this
case,
but
i
thought
it
was
misleading
to
the
court.
there
are
minimum
standards
for
vesting,
funding,
participation
and
such
things,
but
there
are
no
minimum
level
of
benefits.
there
certainly
is
no
limitation
as
the
petition
suggests
on
liability
clauses
after
1976,
none
whatsoever.
i
suggest
you
look
at
the
general
motor
clause
that
is
presently
in
existence,
and
clearly
that
is
a
legal
clause.
the
point
has
been
made
that
this
plan
is
a
collectively
bargained
plan,
and
certainly
that
is
true.
however,
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
have
in
mind
the
fact
that
we
are
construing
a
statute
applicable
to
a
universe
on
which
almost
90
percent
of
the
plans
are
not
collectively
bargained.
reference
has
also
been
made
--
mr.
henry
rose
no.
this
plan
had
non-forfeitable
benefits
in
it
already.
mr.
henry
rose
all
plans
were
required
to
amend
themselves
to
comply
with
titles
i
and
ii.
yes,
if
the
vesting
standards
in
the
plan
did
not
meet
the
minimum
standards
for
investing,
funding
and
participation,
they
had
to
be
amended,
but
that
would
not
affect
in
any
way
whatsoever
the
employer
liability
or
the
relationship
to
title
iv
except
insofar
as
the
guarantee
is
related
to
the
plan
terms,
as
the
plan
terms
became
improved
the
guarantee
would
improve
also.
mr.
henry
rose
reference
has
been
made
to
statutory
subjugation.
there
is
no
subjugation
under
this
statute,
none
whatsoever.
the
liability
of
the
employer
under
title
iv
is
a
statutory
liability
to
the
pbgc.
we
have
no
subjugated
right
against
the
employer
derivative
from
the
participants
at
all.
in
closing,
let
me
say
that
before
the
enactment
of
erisa,
the
defined
--
when
a
defined
benefit
pension
plan
terminated
without
sufficient
funds
to
pay
the
accrued
benefits
that
the
participants
had
already
accrued,
the
entire
burden
of
that
insufficiency
fell
on
the
shoulders
of
the
participants.
by
enacting
title
iv,
congress
has
made
a
decision
that
no
longer
should
that
burden
of
insufficiency
be
borne
by
the
participants
alone.
congress
decided
that
that
burden
should
be
shared
by
their
employer
and
by
the
premium
payers
to
the
pbgc.
