mr.
m.
jay
whitman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
you
are
dealing
with
any
statutory
issue
as
we
are
here,
it
really
makes
sense
to
begin
with
understanding
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
solve.
the
problem
here
as
congress
saw
it
was
that
people
who
had
worked
for
employers
for
a
good
long
piece
of
time
were
losing
their
expected
pension
benefits.
congress
wanted
to
stop
that.
congress
knew
that
very
often,
as
a
matter
of
contract,
law,
these
expectations
couldn't
be
met
as
a
matter
of
contract
law.
but
this
isn't
a
contractual
case,
it
isn't
a
contractual
issue.
in
fact,
the
fact
that
the
contractual
arrangements
were
not
adequate
is
what
made
congress
seek
a
legislative
solution.
that
is
what
required
a
legislative
solution.
now,
in
coming
to
that
solution,
congress
was
trying
to
solve
a
difficult
problem
and
obviously
it
had
to
make
judgments,
to
strike
a
balance
at
the
economic
hardships
and
the
economic
benefits
in
them,
but
that
is
nothing
novel.
that
is
the
function
of
the
legislative
branch.
they
do
it
every
day.
the
petitioner
disagrees
with
the
burden
that
was
struck
in
this
situation
because
nachman
voluntarily
chose
to
terminate
its
plan
rather
than
say
freeze
the
plan.
they
are
now
facing
the
consequence
of
that
termination.
but
the
solution
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
contractual
arrangements
other
than,
as
mr.
rose
said,
they
take
their
measure
in
some
degree
from
the
contractual
arrangements.
the
loss
that
congress
was
trying
to
prevent,
loss
of
these
expectations
occurred
in
a
couple
of
different
ways.
in
on-going
pension
plans,
it
occurred
because
of
overly
restrictive
vesting
requirements,
the
sort
of
provision
we
had
in
the
daniels
case,
the
20
years,
if
you
don't
work
20
continuous
years
you
lose
your
pension.
or
it
could
have
occurred
because
of
lax
funding
and
the
money
wasn't
there
or
because
some
fiduciary
embezzled
the
money.
those
were
problems
where
the
loss
occurred
in
on-going
plan
situations.congress
was
well
aware
from
the
studebaker
example,
which
was
a
very
painful
example,
and
from
the
department
of
labor
and
treasury
study
which
it
relied
on,
the
'72
study,
that
it
was
entirely
possible
and
indeed
generally
the
case
that
in
plans
where
you
had
exemplary
vesting
requirements
and
where
the
funding
was
not
questioned,
it
was
actuarial
sound,
you
could
still
have
a
loss,
you
could
still
have
that
human
tragedy
because
of
a
plan
termination
short
of
the
full
amortization
cycle
so
that
the
money
wasn't
there.
now,
title
i
and
title
ii,
the
vesting
requirements
which
petitioner
wants
to
bring
into
this
case,
obviously
couldn't
solve
that
problem.
they
couldn't
solve
the
studebaker
problem.
you
needed
title
iv.
you
needed
an
insurance
arrangement
to
solve
that
problem.
if
you
understand
the
two
different
sources
of
the
loss
and
the
functions
of
the
different
titles,
you
see,
then
it
is
clear
why
the
effective
dates
of
title
i
and
it
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
method
chosen
by
congress
to
solve
the
problem
in
title
iv.
now,
the
legislative
history
is
plain
in
terms
of
congress'
intent
to
make
title
iv
effective
immediately,
indeed
retroactively.
it
is
also
plain
that
congress
realized
that
the
bulk
of
the
losses
occurred
because
of
these
limitation
liability
clauses.
that
1972
joint
departmental
study
i
think
said
some
72
percent
of
the
cases,
the
loss
of
benefit
expectations
was
1/1000th
of
the
net
worth
of
the
employer
that
terminated
the
plan,
and
only
3
percent
of
the
cases
where
the
loss
was
occasioned
by
some
insolvency
problem
because
the
employer's
net
worth
was
down
to
about
the
level
of
the
benefits
that
were
lost.
now,
turning
to
the
--
mr.
rose
has
already
spoken
about
the
fact
that
you
really
can't
square
a
16-month
delay
which
follows
from
nachman's
position
with
the
two-month
retroactivity
and
the
none-month
post
act
possibility
of
a
waives.
but
let
me
turn
to
the
language
of
title
iv
itself.
throughout
title
iv,
the
language
presumes
a
logical
ability
to
distinguish
between
the
existence
of
non-forfeitable
claims
and
claims
which
are
not
fully
funded,
and
that
is
not
at
all
odd
because
it
is
claims
that
are
non-forfeitable
but
not
fully
funded
that
need
a
guarantee.
yet,
of
course,
nachman's
position
doesn't
admit
that
there
can
be
such
a
beast.
the
clearest
example
of
that
is
in
the
provisions
in
4044(d)
the
distribution
of
assets.
there
is
a
fifth
category
which
says
other
non-forfeitable
benefits.
well,
of
course,
the
existence
of
that
category
makes
absolutely
no
sense
on
nachman's
reading,
assuming
arguendo
we
apply
319,
and
we
have
good
reasons
not
to.
and
throughout
the
other
parts
of
title
iv
we
have
the
trustee
being
charged
to
do
a
calculation
as
to
what
the
non-forfeitable
benefits
are
and
what
the
funds
available
are.
the
pbgc
becomes
trustee
in
some
situation
and
it
is
charged
with
doing
that
calculation.
the
trustees
have
to
make
reports
under
title
i
as
to
what
non-forfeitable
benefits
exist
that
aren't
fully
funded.
those
things
are
either
trivial
or
nonsensical
on
nachman's
reading.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
address
this
problem
of
limitation
of
liability
clause
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised.
those
limitation
of
liability
clauses
were
lawful
before
erisa.
they
are
lawful
now.
westinghouse,
gm,
studebaker,
and
others
are
indistinguishable
in
result.
they
serve
a
real
purpose,
and
general
motors
is
right
to
have
some
trepidations
there.
they
provide
that
a
participant
cannot
bring
a
direct
action
against
the
assets
of,
say,
the
general
motors
corporation
for
his
benefit
entitlement.
they
regulate
dealings
between
the
participant
and
the
employer.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
title
iv.
indeed,
if
anything,
it
was
congress'
purpose
in
title
iv
to
make
those
limitation
of
liability
clauses
irrelevant
because
what
they
were
doing
was
preventing
people
from
actually
coming
into
possession
of
their
benefits.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
by
the
beneficiary.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
pbgc,
right.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
excuse
me,
your
honor.
pbgc
provides
its
benefit
guarantee
by
virtue
of
federal
statute
4022.
it
doesn't
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
company
in
operating
the
plan.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
i
can
illustrate
with
a
simple
example.
suppose
you
have
a
plan
where
the
level
of
benefits
exceeds
the
guarantee
level,
where
because
of
the
phase-in
rules
pbgc's
guarantee
is
substantially
lower,
which
is,
by
the
way,
the
case
in
the
general
auto
industry
plan.
in
that
situation,
the
limitation
liability
clause
would
operate
to
prevent
pbgc
from
going
any
further
to
collect
for
those
benefits
above
the
level.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
that's
right,
which
in
many
cases
is
substantially
less
because
pbgc
doesn't
guarantee
the
full
sum.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
in
this
situation,
your
honor,
the
benefit
levels
in
the
plan
were
very
low.
it
was
a
low
wage
enterprise
in
the
inner
city
of
chicago
and
it
happens
that
the
pbgc
guarantees
are
essentially
the
same,
perhaps
identical.
i
am
not
sure
the
exact
figures.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
yes.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
yes.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
no,
the
limitation
of
liability
clause
in
the
plan
would
prevent
pbgc
from
pursuing
the
company
on
its
own
assets.
pbgc
can
only
pursue
the
company
when
its
does
so
under
4062
of
the
act
and
then
only
under
the
conditions
specified.
among
those
are
that
4062
claimed
liability
can
only
arise
from
the
fact
that
pbgc
guarantees
benefits
and
only
to
the
extent
that
it
does
guarantee
benefits.
if
it
doesn't
guarantee
benefits
because
of
the
phase-in
rule
or
because
you
hit
the
30
percent
pay,
the
4062
liability
drops
correspondingly.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
if
today
for
some
reason
that
i
can't
imagine
general
motors
would
--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
we
should
all
go
home
if
general
motors
terminated
its
pension
plan.
if
general
motors
were
to
terminate
and
as
a
result
pbgc
had
to
pay
benefits
under
4022,
which
would
be
the
case
because
there
is
an
unfunded
past
service
liability
in
the
general
motors
pension
plan,
indeed
an
immense
one.
then
pbgc
would
have
a
4062
employer
liability
claim
against
general
motors
for
that
amount
but
only
that
amount.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
you
cannot,
an
employer
cannot
by
prospective
contract
get
immunity
from
a
legislative
enactment,
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
