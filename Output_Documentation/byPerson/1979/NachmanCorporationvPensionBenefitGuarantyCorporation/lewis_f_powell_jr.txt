powell,

it
is
less
severe,
you
said,
and
it
is
less
severe
only
by
reason
of
that
30
percent
limitation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
applicable
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
30
percent
allocation
doesn't
come
into
play
here,
does
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
in
this
case
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
severe.

mr.
rose,
let
me
just
clarify
one
thing
in
my
mind.
your
opponent,
in
response
to
a
question
i
asked,
said
that
if
this
plan
had
been
terminated
a
year
later,
in
that
interval
between
'76
and
'77
they
would
have
been
required
by
the
statute
to
amend
the
plan
to
make
what
are
now
vested
benefits
also
non-forfeitable.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand,
but
would
they
have
been
required
to
make
any
change
in
the
plan?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
see.
