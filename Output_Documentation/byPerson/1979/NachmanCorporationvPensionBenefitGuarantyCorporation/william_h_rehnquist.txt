justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gettleman,
is
it
your
position
that
after
january
1,
1976,
an
employer
and
a
union
could
not
negotiate
a
plan
in
which
disclaimed
personal
liability
on
the
part
of
the
employer
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
a
specific
disclaimer
of
liability
on
the
part
of
the
employer
as
opposed
to
the
plan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
after
january
1,
1976,
that
is
not
permissible?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
those
two
are
the
same,
to
say
we
disclaim
any
personal
liability
and
to
say
you
couldn't
look
any
further
than
the
assets
in
the
plan.
there
is
no
difference
between
those
two.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
would
have
been
amended
out
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provided
for
such
amendment
or
not,
wouldn't
they,
simply
by
force
of
congress'
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
are
unions
so
critical
in
your
analysis?
i
mean,
couldn't
a
private
individual,
simply
an
employee
who
was
not
represented
by
a
union
have
a
contract
for
a
pension
plan
that
would
be
affected
by
erisa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
no
impairment
of
contract
clause
applicable
against
the
federal
government,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rose,
what
is
pbgc's
position
as
to
whether
after
january
1,
1976
there
could
be
a
disclaimer
of
personal
liability
on
the
part
of
the
employer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
disagree
with
your
opponent
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
is
apart
from
the
reasoning
of
the
seventh
circuit
at
that
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
although
it
doesn't
affect
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
although
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
this
case
which
approach
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
congress
used
the
terms
"vested"
and
"non-forfeitable"
interchangeably
throughout
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
you
file
that
affidavit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
whitman,
if
the
company
disclaims
liability
in
its
agreements
with
the
employees
as
to
the
company
itself,
you
say
that
title
iv
nonetheless
entitles
pbgc
to
come
after
the
company
under
the
circumstances
specified
by
justice
stevens?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
but
after
january
1,
1976,
general
motors
flatly
provided
in
a
contract
that
there
shall
be
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
company
for
pension
benefits.
now,
under
erisa
can
pbgc
come
after
general
motors
if
the
plan
defaults?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
say
general
something
or
other
then.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
an
employer
cannot
completely
disclaim
liability
and
figure
that
he
is
home
free?
