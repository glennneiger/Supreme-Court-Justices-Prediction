mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
robert
gettleman
and
i
am
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner,
nachman
corporation.
this
case
presents
one
of
the
first
opportunities
for
this
court
to
examine
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974,
known
by
its
acronym
erisa,
and
the
first
occasion
directly
involving
interpretation
of
specific
exceptions
to
that
statute.
significantly,
it
involves
the
operation
of
erisa
at
its
initial
stages.
the
nachman
corporation
was
an
employer
which
terminated
a
pension
plan
in
december
of
1975,
and
which
under
the
terms
of
that
plan
was
not
required
to
continue
to
fund
any
more
payments
under
the
terminated
plan.
prior
to
erisa,
nachman
was
governed
by
the
internal
revenue
code
and
the
common
law
of
contracts,
and
those
laws
allowed
an
employer
to
do
just
what
nachman
did,
terminate
a
plan
and
under
its
terms
not
be
liable
for
further
contributions.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
erisa
prior
to
1976
changed
the
rules
to
require
an
employer
such
as
nachman
to
continue
to
fund
the
plan.
the
case
requires
an
examination
both
of
the
terms
of
erisa
itself
and
of
the
various
provisions
of
the
plan.
and
first
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
describe
erisa.
that
statute
was
enacted
in
september
of
1974
as
an
attempt
by
congress
to
cure
many
of
the
problems
which
were
plaguing
private
pensions
in
this
country
at
that
time.
among
those
problems
was
the
issue
involved
when
a
plan
terminated
with
insufficient
funds
to
pay
all
the
benefits
under
the
plan.
in
titles
i
and
ii
of
erisa,
and
it
was
a
four-title
act,
the
statute
prescribes
for
the
first
time
that
a
plan
must
provide
a
certain
minimum
level
of
benefits
and
that
these
benefits
have
to
be
what
was
defined
in
the
act
as
non-forfeitable
benefits.
that
means
unconditional
and
legally
enforceable
benefits.
it
also
provided
that
the
employer
must
undertake
to
fund
those
benefits.
in
title
iv
of
the
act,
erisa
established
a
termination
insurance
program
to
be
operated
by
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation,
the
respondent
in
this
case
today.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
that
they
are
synonymous
because
the
rights
under
the
particular
plan
that
nachman
had
with
its
employees
were
not
enforceable
or
collectable
because
of
the
various
provisions
of
the
plan
which
made
--
which
precluded
further
employer
liability,
which
allocated
benefits
on
termination
in
a
particular
type
of
order,
and
benefits
that
are
at
issue
in
this
litigation,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
those
benefits
which
were
not
funded.
there
were
benefits
which
were
funded
under
the
nachman
plan
and
to
that
extent
we
are
not
in
litigation.
we
are
only
talking
about
the
unfunded
benefits.
they
were
neither
collectable
nor
enforceable
nor
unconditional
and
they
did
not
meet
the
statutory
term
of
non-forfeitable
or
the
statutory
definition
of
that
term.
and
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
pbgc
guarantees
under
title
iv
only
non-forfeitable
benefits
under
the
terms
of
a
plan.
and
it
is
also
important
to
recognize,
as
this
court
has
done,
that
congress
when
it
enacted
erisa
paid
great
attention
to
the
types
of
problems
which
would
be
created
by
the
new
requirements
of
this
statute.
it
did
not
make
the
entire
statute
effective
immediately
but
provided
grace
periods
during
which
certain
provisions
would
be
phased
on
before
compliance
was
required.
among
those
provisions
was
the
minimum
benefit
provisions
of
titles
i
and
ii
and
the
non-forfeitability
requirement
of
titles
i
and
ii.
those
provisions
did
not
take
effect
until
plan
years
beginning
in
january
1976.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
basically,
yes.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
dealt
with
types
of
limitation
clauses
which
might
be
permissible
even
after
1976.
there
is
no
question
that
the
type
of
clauses
in
the
nachman
plan
would
not
have
been
permitted
after
1976.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
no,
that
would
not
have
been,
that
would
not
have
been
allowed.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
that
is
not
permitted,
that's
right.
the
general
motors
plan
--
they
are
an
amicus
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
--
and
some
other
plans
apparently
have
limited
liability
to
the
assets
of
the
plan
or
to
the
pbgc
guarantee,
which
means
basically
that
all
of
the
protections
of
title
iv
are
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
plan.
but
the
type
of
limitation
clause
or
disclaimer
clause
that
we
had
would
not
have
been
permitted,
which
was
basically
a
general
disclaimer.
we
are
obligated
to
pay
a
certain
amount
into
the
plan
and
after
that
we
have
no
further
liability.
that
is
no
longer
allowed.
this
case
arises
because
the
non-forfeitability
requirements
were
effected
in
1976,
but
the
termination
insurance
program
went
into
effect
upon
enactment
in
1974.
the
difference
between
those
two
dates
really
raises
the
issues
which
are
presented
in
this
case.
i
would
like
just
briefly
to
discuss
the
plan.
i
have
already
discussed
it
somewhat,
but
i
would
like
to
go
back
a
bit
and
discuss
the
type
of
plan
we
have
here
before
the
court.
it
was
established
in
1960
for
certain
employees
of
nachman's
north
chicago
plant
as
a
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
nachman
and
united
auto
workers
which
represented
those
employees.
united
auto
workers
is
an
intervening
party
in
this
case.
it
was
part
of
a
package
of
wages
and
non-wage
compensation
bargained
collectively
between
the
parties
to
this
plan.
it
was
what
was
known
as
a
combined
benefit
plan
and
it
provided
various
normal
retirement
benefits,
that
is
benefits
that
would
be
payable
upon
the
reaching
of
normal
retirement
age,
in
this
case
65,
as
well
as
certain
early
benefits
and
disability
benefits.
it
required
the
employer
to
make
contributions
annually
into
the
plan
based
upon
an
actuarial
table
which
contemplated
that
if
the
plan
remained
in
existence
thirty
years
and
if
that
level
of
benefits
was
maintained,
all
benefits
in
the
plan
would
be
fully
funded,
and
the
reason
that
all
benefits
in
this
type
of
plan
were
not
fully
funded
immediately
is
because
the
contributions
were
based
on
hours
worked.
contributions
based
upon
current
service
were
paid
currently;
contributions
based
upon
services
rendered
before
the
establishment
of
the
plan
were
based
upon
a
thirty-year
amortization
schedule.
this
is
still
permissible
under
erisa.
unfortunately,
however,
nachman
was
compelled
to
close
its
plant
for
economic
reasons
in
1975,
after
only
fifteen
years,
and
therefore
terminated
the
plan.
it
did
so
lawfully.
there
is
no
question
or
contest
that
it
did
anything
improper
in
terminating
the
plan.
it
obeyed
the
terms
of
the
plan
which
governed
the
rights
of
the
parties
upon
termination.
one
of
them
is
a
term
i
mentioned
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
and
that
is
it
was
a
normal
type
of
what
was
called
a
disclaimer
clause,
but
it
said
more
than
just
we
disclaim
any
further
liability.
article
v
of
the
plan
told
the
employees
that
they
could
not
look
any
further
than
the
assets
in
the
plan
at
the
time
it
terminated
to
get
their
benefits.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
i
think
it
goes
a
little
further
than
just
saying
that,
than
just
saying
we
disclaim
any
more
liability.
it
says
to
the
employee,
your
benefits
will
be
paid
from
the
assets,
and
part
of
the
issue
and
part
of
the
seventh
circuit's
dissertation
on
the
definition
of
non-forfeitable
contained
in
the
statute
was
that
these
were
not
claims
that
could
be
asserted
against
the
plan.
we
say
that
that
clause
says
both
that
you
cannot
assert
a
claim
against
the
employer
or
the
plan,
but
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
plan,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
which
govern
the
rights
of
the
parties
upon
termination.
article
ix
of
the
plan
provides
that
it
was
allowed
to
be
amended
to
comply
with
changes
in
the
law
but
that
no
such
amendment
would
affect
the
level
of
contributions
required
of
the
employer
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
this
was
obviously
for
the
benefit
of
both
the
employer
and
the
employees,
and
it
protected
the
integrity
of
the
bargain
between
those
parties.
article
x
of
the
plan
governed
termination
and
allowed
either
side
to
terminate
upon
60
days'
notice
but
not
during
the
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
again
an
effort
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
to
answer
the
question
directly,
yes,
but
the
plan
would
have
been
amended
in
1976.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
yes,
because
at
that
time
all
plans
were
required
to
provide
a
non-forfeiture
benefit.
these
types
of
provisions
would
have
been
amended
out
and
plans
all
over
the
country
employed
many
lawyers
amending
these
provisions
during
that
period
of
time.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
that's
right.
at
that
time
the
congressional
direction
overrode
the
contract
between
the
parties,
but
not
until
that
time,
and
our
plan
terminated
before
that
time
and
that
is
really
the
point
of
this
whole
case.
our
plan
and
obviously
some
others
terminated
prior
to
1976.
there
is
just
one
other
provision
of
the
plan
that
i
would
like
to
mention
briefly
and
that
is
that
when
the
plan
terminated,
an
allocation
schedule
was
set
up
in
article
x
which
divided
the
assets
according
to
six
categories
of
employees,
basically
the
oldest
first,
those
getting
benefits
at
the
time
of
termination,
those
eligible
to
receive
normal
retirement
benefits,
and
on
down.
when
a
category
was
reached
for
which
there
were
insufficient
assets,
the
assets
were
distributed
pro
rata
to
that
category
and
there
were
no
further
rights
to
receive
any
other
benefits
under
the
plan.
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
this
was
a
legal,
lawful
tax
qualified
irs
approved
pension
plan
at
the
time
it
terminated.
it
met
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
governing
law.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
that's
right,
and
that
is
exactly
what
congress
intended.
that
is
precisely
what
congress
intended.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
but
the
company
had
the
opportunity
to
adjust
to
the
new
requirements.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
no,
no.
your
honor,
this
is
a
16-month
period
between
enactment
and
the
effective
date
of
these
requirements
and
during
that
time
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
expired
and
we
were
allowed
to
terminate
the
plan.
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
our
plan
was
terminated
practically
at
the
earliest
date
we
could
have
because
on
september
2,
1974,
when
erisa
was
enacted,
we
were
right
in
the
middle
of
a
three-year
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
expired
in
october
of
1975.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
yes.
we
could
have
picked
november
1st.
we
picked
the
last
day
of
the
grace
period
for
administrative
convenience
and
to
make
our
lives
easier,
i
suppose.
but
it
was
in
1975
and
that
was
the
operative
fact.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
emphasize
once
again
that
this
was
a
collectively
bargained
plan.
the
employees
were
represented
by
a
major
union
in
this
country
and
certainly
had
no
right
or
no
reason
to
expect
anything
other
than
what
the
plan
provided.
they
certainly
had
no
reason
to
expect
prior
to
erisa
that
the
employer
would
be
liable
to
continue
to
fund
this
plan
after
termination.
that
is
what
they
bargained
for,
that
is
what
they
got.
when
the
plan
terminated,
which
was
not
a
particularly
happy
event
for
anybody
because
the
plant
closed
down,
when
the
plant
terminated
there
were
approximately
$575,000
which
had
been
contributed
by
nachman
over
the
fifteen
years.
this
sum
was
enough
to
pay
everybody
who
was
receiving
benefits
and
everybody
who
had
worked
for
nachman
ten
years
who
was
over
the
age
of
60.
below
that
category,
however,
there
is
no
question
that
there
were
insufficient
assets
to
pay
the
remaining
benefits.
and
again,
there
is
no
question
that
had
this
plan
survived
that
other
day,
it
would
have
been
required
to
provide
a
truly
non-forfeitable
benefit,
but
it
is
just
as
clear
that
prior
to
1976
it
was
not
required
to
provide
a
non-forfeitable
benefit.
and
since
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
insures
only
non-forfeitable
benefits
and
the
employer
is
liable
to
the
pbgc
to
reimburse
them
for
any
benefits
so
insured
and
actually
paid
by
them,
the
issue
then
is
whether
these
benefits
were
non-forfeitable
under
the
terms
of
the
nachman
plan.
the
district
court
held
that
they
were
not,
that
they
were
forfeitable
and
properly
forfeited.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
limited
to
the
interpretive
issue.
we
also
raised
a
constitutional
question
but
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
limited
only
to
the
interpretive
issue.
as
i
mentioned,
a
term
is
defined
in
the
statute
itself
as
unconditional
and
legally
enforceable
against
the
plan.
our
position
really
is
very
simple.
we
contend
that
a
benefit
which
was
conditioned
upon
the
sufficiency
of
assets
at
termination
was
by
definition
conditional
and
therefore
for
that
reason
alone
not
non-forfeitable.
we
also
claim
that
under
the
provisions
of
the
plan
which
i
have
described,
the
rights
at
issue
in
this
case
could
not
be
enforced
against
either
the
plan
or
the
employer.
to
be
unforfeitable,
a
benefit
must
be
both
unconditional
and
legally
enforceable.
we
are
neither.
if
we
were
not
just
one
of
those,
we
would
be
forfeitable
and
therefore
not
insured
by
the
pbgc
and
therefore
the
employer
would
not
be
liable
to
the
pbgc.
the
respondents
in
this
case
would
rather
look
instead
to
the
statutory
definition
to
pbgc's
own
definition
contained
in
a
regulation
promulgated
about
a
year
after
erisa
was
enacted,
in
september
1975.
the
definition
provides
in
effect
that
a
benefit
becomes
non-forfeitable
when
the
employee
satisfies
all
the
conditions
imposed
upon
him.
it
makes
no
mention
whatever,
however,
of
the
statutory
requirement
that
the
benefit
be
unconditional
and
legally
enforceable.
we
claim
that
that
definition
is
invalid
because
it
contradicts
the
statutory
definition.
we
claim
it
is
invalid
because
it
is
unnecessary
because
congress
provided
its
own
definition
of
this
term
in
very
clear
and
unambiguous
language.
and
even
more
important,
we
claim
that
their
definition
and
in
fact
their
whole
position
in
this
case
is
improper
and
would
result
in
the
immediate
imposition
of
liability
on
nachman
corporation
and
employers
like
nachman
corporation
on
the
date
of
enactment
of
erisa
in
september
1974.
i
think
that
it
is
very
clear
that,
although
congress
certainly
intended
to
prohibit
types
of
limitation
of
clauses
we
had,
they
just
as
clearly
intended
to
provide
prospective,
effective
dates
and
not
to
impose
immediate
and
retroactive
liability.
yet
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
concedes
that
its
ruling
does
result
in
a
retroactive
effect
on
nachman
corporation.
this
court
has,
although
not
dealt
with
erisa
directly
as
in
this
case,
it
has
compared
erisa
to
certain
other
situations
which
resulted
in
retroactive
changes
to
pension
plans.
the
first
such
case
was
city
of
los
angeles
v.
manhart,
at
435
u.s.,
in
which
justice
stevens,
writing
for
a
unanimous
court,
found
that
although
a
title
vii
violation
had
occurred
by
compelling
women
to
pay
more
into
a
pension
plan
than
men
because
they
lived
longer,
that
a
retroactive
remedy
was
inappropriate
in
that
case
for
several
reasons.
one
of
those
reasons
was
the
drastic
effect
that
retroactively
imposed
rules
or
remedies
would
have
on
pension
plans,
because
pension
plans
were
for
the
future,
they
look
to
the
future.
they
make
contributions
and
obligations
based
upon
future
expectations.
to
impose
retroactively
a
burden
or
a
remedy
on
them
had
drastic
effects,
and
i
quote
from
page
721
of
that
opinion
--
after
going
through
that,
justice
stevens
wrote
"consequently,
the
rules
that
apply
to
these
funds
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
unless
the
legislature
has
plainly
commanded
that
result."
and
at
that
point
the
opinion
cites
to
erisa
as
an
example
of
an
instance
where
congress
did
not
want
retroactive
application
to
a
pension
plan.
and
i
quote
again.
"in
1974,
congress
underlined
the
importance
of
making
only
gradual
and
prospective
changes
in
the
rules
that
govern
pension
plans.
the
bill"
--
citing
erisa
--
"the
bill
paid
careful
attention
to
the
problem
of
retroactivity
and
set
a
wide
variety
of
effective
dates
for
the
different
provisions
and
cites
to
the
exact
sections
of
erisa
which
we
rely
upon
in
this
case,
namely
that
sections
which
are
in
29
u.s.c.,
section
1061
and
1086,
those
are
the
sections
that
provide
the
1976
effective
dates.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
no,
your
honor,
but
you
recognize
the
congressional
intent
that
we
rely
upon
in
this
case.
that
was
title
vii.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
that's
right,
but
that
is
precisely
the
point.
congress
didn't
make
the
act
effective
immediately.
they
didn't
make
the
more
burdensome
provisions
of
that
act
--
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
it
insures
by
definition
the
same
thing
it
insures
after
that
date,
non-forfeitable
benefits
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
no,
most
funds,
you
must
assume
--
and
i
think
it
is
true
--
are
operated
honestly
and
the
reason
that
there
was
insufficient
funding
was
because
of
this
past
service
liability,
the
contributions
for
the
years
before
the
establishment
of
a
plan
were
substantial.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
okay.
during
that
period
of
time,
we
know
from
an
affidavit
filed
in
the
district
court
by
the
pbgc
itself
that
there
were
--
i
am
trying
to
get
the
exact
number
--
136
plans
which
terminated
during
the
grace
period
which
had
insufficient
assets
upon
termination.
forty-three
percent
of
those
plans
had
non-forfeitable
benefits,
even
though
they
weren't
required
to
at
that
time
they
provided
them.
they
did
not
have
the
limitation
clauses
which
we
had
in
our
plan
and
which
the
remaining
57
percent
had
in
their
plans.
there
is
$20
million
worth
of
benefits
insured
under
that
program
during
the
grace
period.
we
think
it
was
a
significant
role
that
the
pbgc
played
during
the
grace
period.
after
the
grace
period,
all
plans
were
required
to
provide
non-forfeitable
benefits
and
all
plans
and
all
benefits
which
were
non-forfeitable
as
they
were
required
to
be
were
therefore
insured.
the
pbgc
during
the
grace
period
also
had
to
set
premiums.
it
was
a
brand
new
agency.
it
had
to
get
established
and
set
its
housekeeping
regulations.
so
when
you
put
title
iv
and
titles
i
and
ii
together,
it
demonstrates
a
cohesive
scheme
to
get
this
program
rolling
to
give
people
time
to
adjust,
not
to
impose
retroactive
liability,
not
to
impose
immediate
and
substantial
liability
on
employers
which
had
never
bargained
for
and
never
expected
to
and
perhaps
could
not
pay
that
type
of
price.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
they
did
not
limit
the
employer's
liability.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
because
they
terminated
with
insufficient
assets.
those
plans
terminated
--
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
there
would
but
the
employer,
one,
could
be
insolvent;
two,
there
was
a
30
percent
limitation
--
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
more
than
just
that,
your
honor.
the
termination
insurance
program
provides
an
easily
accessible
uncostly
efficient
administrative
scheme
to
pay
pension
benefits
to
the
average
employee
of
a
plan.
if
a
plan
were
to
terminate
and
the
employer
for
one
reason
or
another
denied
liability
or
didn't
have
the
money
or
wanted
to
stall,
they
could
go
to
the
pbgc
and
get
their
pension
benefit,
and
it
was
up
to
the
pbgc
to
go
after
the
employer
under
the
statutory
subjugation.
that
is
the
case
today.
that
is
the
case
today,
because
even
though
the
plan
must
provide
a
non-forfeited
benefit
it
still
needs
to
fully
fund
the
plan
on
a
current
basis.
and
even
today
an
employer
can
go
out
of
business
--
not
go
out
of
business
--
an
employer
could
terminate
a
plan
if
he
has
a
right
to
do
so,
and
if
he
goes
out
of
business
and
is
insolvent,
the
employees
go
to
the
pbgc.
even
if
he
is
not,
the
employees
can
go
to
the
pbgc.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
i
have
never
read
the
studebaker
plan.
it
occurred
in
1963,
i
believe,
and
a
large
number
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
it
had
a
limitation
--
i
believe
that
plan
had
a
limitation
clause
similar
to
ours
and
the
legislature
said
to
both
employers
and
employees
or
at
least
employees
unions,
because
we
have
to
assume
that
they
were
represented
by
the
unions
as
well,
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
limit
liability
to
the
employer
any
more.
but
they
didn't
say
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
do
that
upon
enactment.
they
said
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
do
that
after
1976.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
certainly.
today
they
are
all
affected
by
it
equally.
there
are
different
rules
for
proprietorships
and
partnerships
which
do
not
relate
to
this
case.
with
respect
to
corporate
plans,
there
are
even
some
different
rules
for
collective
bargaining
plans.
some
dates
are
extended
even
beyond
the
1976
date
for
collectively
bargained
plans.
but
we
think
the
fact
that
this
was
collectively
bargained
really
relates
to
the
basic
thrust
i
think
of
our
opponents'
argument
and
much
of
the
congressional
concern
that
these
may
have
been
either
unilaterally
imposed
or
that
they
promised
illusory
benefits.
we
don't
think
our
plan
promised
anything
that
wasn't
the
subject
of
arms
length
bargaining
between
the
employer
and
employee,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
equitable
argument
on
the
other
side
we
think
it
doesn't
apply
to
a
collectively
bargained
plan
such
as
the
nachman
plan.
i
would
just
like
to
take
one
more
minute
and
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
and
that
is
to
mention
that
the
language
of
the
manhart
which
i
have
quoted
was
also
quoted
in
the
allied
structural
steel
case
also
in
1978
at
438
u.
s.,
where
this
court
struck
down
a
statute,
a
state
pension
statute
which
imposed
immediate
liability
for
all
employees
of
ten
years
or
more,
and
compared
once
again
the
prospective
not
immediate
effect
of
erisa
in
so
striking
down
the
state
statute,
and
we
are
asking
really
for
nothing
more
than
the
continued
recognition
of
that
congressional
intent
and
purpose
which
appears
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself.
we
really
don't
have
to
look
to
legislate
debate
or
committee
report.
it
is
right
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
this
court
i
submit
has
recognized
that
very
strong
intent
and
the
result
that
should
be
reached
in
this
case
in
both
the
manhart
and
the
allied
case.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
no,
but
there
would
be
a
very
analogous
due
process
argument,
justice
rehnquist,
which
we
did
raise
in
the
lower
courts.
the
district
court
did
not
reach
that
point
because
it
interpreted
the
statute
our
way.
the
court
of
appeals
did
reach
the
constitutional
question.
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
limited
only
to
the
interpretive
issue
and
not
the
constitutional
question.
but
we
think
that
there
could
be
a
very
serious
constitutional
question
if
the
statute
is
interpreted
the
way
the
respondents
contend.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
gettleman
fine.
i
shouldn't
need
more
than
that,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
let
me
read
the
clause
from
the
gm
contract.
it
is
on
page
9
of
their
amicus
brief.
"no
liability
for
the
payment
of
pension
benefits
or
supplements
under
the
plan
shall
be
imposed
upon
the
corporation,
officers,
directors
or
stockholders
except
as
otherwise
may
be
required
by
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974."
it
is
an
exercise
in
tail-chasing
but
an
exercise
which
is
permitted
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
we
have
cited
i
think
in
both
of
our
briefs
--
i
am
reading
from
page
9
of
our
reply
brief
--
the
i.r.c.
regulation
1.411(a),
which
says,
"rights
which
are
conditioned
upon
sufficiency
of
plan
assets
in
the
event
of
termination
or
partial
termination
are
considered
to
be
forfeitable
because
of
such
condition."
therefore,
it
would
violate
section
203
which
requires
non-forfeitable
benefits.
but
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
gm-type
clause
will
not
be
considered
to
be
forfeitable
and
will
be
tax
qualified.
whether
that
is
a
correct
provision
maybe
will
have
to
wait
until
the
day
gm
does
terminate
its
plan
or
chrysler
or
somebody
else.
that
is
not
the
provision
that
was
in
our
plan,
apparently
not
the
provision
in
a
lot
of
other
plans
which
had
a
general
disclaimer
clause
in
it.
and
as
far
as
the
affidavit
mr.
rose
and
justice
rehnquist
referred
to,
rather
than
read
it,
i
will
just
refer
the
court.
it
begins
at
page
70
and
it
goes
through
page
74,
and
if
it
doesn't
say
what
i
said
it
said,
then
i
am
just
not
reading
the
english
language
correctly
either.
as
far
as
mr.
whitman's
argument
goes,
for
him
to
say
that
the
contract
is
not
important
is
rather
odd
when
the
title
iv
guarantee
by
the
pbgc
is
to
guarantee
non-forfeitable
benefits,
not
period,
but
it
goes
on,
"under
the
terms
of
a
plan."
you
must
always
look
to
the
terms
of
the
plan
to
determine
whether
a
benefit
is
non-forfeitable.
and
i
think
it
is
an
odd
day
when
the
u.a.w.
is
before
this
court
arguing
that
employees
or
employers
should
get
something
other
than
they
bargained
for
across
the
collective
bargaining
table.
to
the
extent
that
erisa
changed
the
rules
of
that
plan,
it
did
so
after
1976.
the
statute
holds
together
when
you
read
titles
i
and
ii,
and
read
them
separately
--
to
read
title
i
and
title
ii
with
title
iv
--
to
read
them
separately
results
in
a
fragmented
nonsensical
congressional
purpose
which
i
think
this
court
once
again,
referring
to
justice
stevens'
comments
in
the
manhart
case,
has
found
to
be
very
coherent,
very
clear,
and
that
is
the
only
thing
we
are
seeking
today,
is
the
recognition
of
that
congressional
intent.
thank
you.
