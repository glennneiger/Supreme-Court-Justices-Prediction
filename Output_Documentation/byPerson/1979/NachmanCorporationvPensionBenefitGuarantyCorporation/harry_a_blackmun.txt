justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
one
other
question,
if
i
may,
on
the
plans
that
were
terminated
during
the
interval
before
the
date
here
and
after
the
enactment
of
the
act.
you
say
about
half
of
them
or
whatever
the
figure
was
had
non-forfeitable
benefits.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
they
also
have
provisions
in
them
that
the
employer
was
liable
for
the
full
amount
of
the
benefits
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
if
that
were
true,
i
still
don't
see
why
you
needed
insurance,
because
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
they
terminated,
wouldn't
there
be
liability
on
the
part
of
the
employer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
risk
being
insured
against
was
the
insolvency
of
employers
whose
plans
would
terminate
when
there
would
be
an
obligation
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
benefits?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
one
other
--
maybe
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
unfair,
but
there
is
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
termination
of
the
studebaker
plan
in
south
bend,
i
think.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
there
is
some
evidence
of
intent
that
that
situation
have
been
covered.
would
you
agree
that
your
reading
of
the
statute
would
cover
that
plan?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
was
a
case
of
insolvency
of
the
employer,
i
think.
