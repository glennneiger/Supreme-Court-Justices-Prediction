justice
byron
r.
white
woodworkers.
you
have
suggested
that
if
we
had
had
this
statute
at
the
time
of
woodworkers
we
would
have
reached
different
results.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
this
argument
was
not
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
the
board
rely
on
this
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
that
make
a
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
we
ought
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
tell
them
to
redo
the
case
in
light
of
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
just
one
factual
question
with
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
situation
you
describe,
i
take
it,
assumed
that
the
consolidation
into
one
large
container
occurred
more
than
50
miles
from
the
pier.
is
that
right?
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
loading
of
the
container
by
the
consolidator
had
been
within
50
miles,
that
the
ila
was
reopening
and
restuffing
those
containers.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
they
doing
at
the
time
the
facts
developed
in
this
case?
weren't
they
doing
it
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
say
about
the
argument
that
the
--
say,
like
in
the
new
york
area,
where
--
and
it's
certainly
argued
in
this
case
that
the
forwarders
perform
special
services
besides
the
stuffing;
that
in
terms
of
efficiency,
expedition,
safety,
et
cetera;
that
that
is
a
special
business;
stuff,
but
they
do
more
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
whatever
it
is,
it
isn't
much.
