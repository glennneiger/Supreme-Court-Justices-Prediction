justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
read
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
believe
it
was
judge
robb's
dissenting
opinion
here,
where
he
said
that
if
a
container
is
part
of
a
whole
--
a
very
large
crate
would
have
to
be
part
of
a
whole,
too
--
i
had
the
feeling
that
one
would
have
to
know
the
business
pretty
well
to
make
a
judgment
on
that.
and
i
had
thought
that
that
was
a
matter
that
was
pretty
much
left
to
the
board
subject
to
review
by
the
courts
of
appeals
for
abusive
discretion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lips,
we
are
here
discussing
purely
facts,
i
take
it.
are
these
facts
that
were
found
by
the
board
and
approved
by
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals?
or
were
they
upset
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
second
guessed
the
board,
in
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lambos.
do
you
accept
then
all
of
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
board
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i,
for
example,
don't
know
what
longshoremen
did
before
so
i
have
to
get
it
out
of
the
record.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
classical
factual
determination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you're
accepting
--
or
not
accepting
--
the
historical
findings
of
fact
of
the
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
factual
inquiry,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
has
been
a
common
thread,
at
least
to
my
understanding
running
through
both
pipefitters
and
sandor
and
woodworkers.
perhaps
as
best
summarized
in
the
last
sentence
of
pipefitters
where
it
says
it
appears
to
us
that
in
reweighing
the
facts
and
setting
aside
the
board's
order,
the
court
of
appeals
improperly
substituted
its
own
views
of
the
facts
for
those
of
the
board.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
opponents
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponents
don't
agree
with
that.
your
opponents
say
the
court
of
appeals
simply
made
an
end
run
or
ignored
the
fact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
you
say
the
court
defines
the
work.
that's
not
finding
facts.
that's
laying
down
rules
of
law.
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
found
as
a
fact
by
the
board
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
part
of
the
dolphin
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
asking
you
whether
it
was
referred
to
by
judge
wright.
were
these
proceedings
part
of
the
dolphin
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
isn't
part
of
the
conex
case.
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case.
in
these
particular
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gleason,
you
say
their
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
is
under
the
proscription
of
the
hot
cargo
clause
if
it
fails
to
meet
certain
work
preservation
standards.
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
isn't
as
if
it
were
simply
a
contract
between
two
private
commercial
people
that
could
go
out
and
make
whatever
contract
they
wanted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
not
work
done
traditionally
by
longshoremen.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
i
mean,
consolidation
done,
say,
50
or
100
miles
away
from
the
port.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
a
primary
function
of
consolidators
to
take
care
of
less
than
car
load
shipments
or
less
than
truck
load
shipments?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
isn't
exactly
automation.
it
isn't
automation,
is
it?
i
guess
automation
gave
it
--
certainly
provided
the
opportunity
for
containerization.
but
it's
just
a
question
of
where
those
containers
are
going
to
be
filled,
stuffed
and
stripped,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nevertheless,
what
the
longshoremen
want
is
the
stripping
done
on
the
pier.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understand.
rather
than
some
place
else.
it's
not
throwing
out
containers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whatever
the
actual
day-to-day
practices
are,
however
various
they
may
be,
there
is
the
agreement,
isn't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
isn't
it
claimed
to
be
