mr.
j.
alan
lips
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
work
in
issue
here
is
the
loading
and
unloading
of
cargo
to
and
from
the
containers.
and
the
only
real
question
is
whether
or
not
the
geographic
location
of
that
work,
when
it's
done,
is
work
that
is
traditionally
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
ila
or,
in
this
case,
the
truckers
and
the
land-related
transportation
industry.
the
record
is
complete
in
this
and
other
cases
that
containers
per
se,
that
is,
large
boxes
have
been
used
for
years,
since
before
world
war
ii,
in
and
out
of
the
ports
on
the
east
coast
covered
by
these
rules.
and
for
years,
the
ila
never
took
the
position
that
this
was
their
work.
they
passed
these
containers
through
frequently;
both
by
those
shipped
by
consolidators
or
the
principals
in
this
case
for
dolphin
forwarding
company
were
called
nonvessel
operating
common
carriers.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
it
most
certainly
has.
but
the
question
becomes
at
what
point
could
or
should
have
the
ila
said
"this
is
our
work."
they
certainly
weren't
ignorant
of
containers
that
passed
through
the
ports,
and
they
let
them
through
for
years
without
claiming
this
work
which,
to
us,
suggests
very
strongly
that
they
didn't
consider
this
their
work.
traditionally,
non-vessel
operating
common
carriers
solicited
their
own
customers.
they
shipped
their
own
goods.
they
issued
the
bills
of
lading.
they
were
responsible
for
the
movement,
not
only
from
the
time
it
left
their
facility
across
the
land,
but
across
the
sea,
too.
so
they
were
the
shipper,
as
it
were;
and
they
assumed
responsibility
for
the
packaging
of
the
container;
and
this
was
historically
done
for
years.
it's
only
when
the
container
became
so
efficient
that
it
began
to
eliminate
the
work
of
longshoremen
on
the
piers
that
the
longshoremen
looked
for
a
way
to
replace
that
work;
and
the
way
they
seized
was
to
replace
it
with
work
that
was
somebody
else's
work;
by
bringing
it
back
on
the
piers.
now,
the
truckers
on
the
import
side
had
traditionally
done
the
same
thing.
in
hampton
roads
and
baltimore,
even
after
the
modern
container
came
into
use
there
around
the
mid-60's
or
'65
or
a
little
bit
before,
it
wasn't
for
three
more
years
in
those
ports
that
the
ila
claimed
that
that
was
their
work.
of
course,
it
wasn't
their
work
because
the
truckers
had
been
doing
it
with
the
modern
containers
as
well
as
the
old
containers
for
years.
the
ila's
chief
argument
in
this
case
is
a
very
simplistic
one.
it
simply
says
we
will
draw
an
arbitrary
50-mile
line;
and
within
that
line,
all
work
that
relates
to
containers
is
our
work.
and
it
can
just
as
easily
be
done
on
the
pier
as
it
can
out
in
the
warehouse.
or
the
freight
station.
or
the
consolidation
station.
it
can
just
as
easily
be
done.
therefore,
we
think
these
are
surrogate
piers
established
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
longshore
rates.
well,
they
missed
the
question
at
all.
that's
too
simplistic
an
answer.
the
fact
is
that
the
container
system
is
a
part
of
the
intermodal
transportation
system.
it
functions
from
point
to
point.
it
was
designed
to
be
that
way.
it's
new
and
different
work.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
it
was
new
work.
it
said
it
was
new
work.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
said
it
believed
that
it
should
have
the
ability
to
rationalize
the
new
work
vis-a-vis
the
old
work.
well,
of
course,
it
came
to
a
different
conclusion
in
its
rationalization
than
the
labor
board
did.
but
the
work
itself
is
new.
the
container
is
designed
to
go
from
point
to
point
which
is
not
necessarily
from
seaport
to
seaport.
it's
from
the
point
at
which
the
customer
and
the
intermodal
transportation
system
desire
that
the
cargo
be
put
in
to
and
taken
out
of
the
container;
and
if
it's
limited
to
simply
the
port,
from
one
pier
to
the
next,
then
the
container
has
no
more
function
than
the
cargo
net.
it's
simply
a
metal
box
that
lifts
cargo
up
to
the
ship
and
takes
it
off
again.
the
reason
that
the
work
is
different
and
cannot
be
done
on
the
pier
is
interrelated
to
why
shippers
use
containers.
to
understand
that,
you
need
to
understand
what
an
nvocc
does.
when
he
brings
the
packages
in,
he
is
taking
less-than-container
load
packages
5
packages
from
cincinnati
10
from
pittsburgh.
these
are
packages
that
the
sea-carriers
really
can't
handle
anyway.
they
don't
have
the
facilities
to
consolidate
all
of
the
many
less-than-container
load
consolidations
that
go
out.
so
the
nvocc
pulls
these
things
together,
and
he
loads
them
in
a
sequential
order
in
the
container
because
he
knows
that
when
that
container
gets
to
its
ultimate
destination,
those
packages
are
going
to
be
delivered
to
different
spots.
and
so
he
loads
the
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
it
was
usually
consolidated;
that
is,
the
nvocc's
traffic
was
consolidated
just
like
it
is
now.
but
then,
when
it
was
taken
to
the
seaport
terminal
by
a
truck,
for
example
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
yes.
and
it
was
not
kept
together.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
the
consolidator
would
coordinate.
before
the
container
system,
the
consolidator
would
basically
coordinate.
he
would
bring
all
these
together.
he
would
be
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
he
would
truck
them.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
and
over-the-road
carriers.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
loose
in
the
truck.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
unless
he
used
a
different
kind
of
container.
there
is
historical
evidence
of
that.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
when
he
got
to
the
pier,
that
cargo
would
be
unloaded
by
the
longshoremen
and
the
trucker
working
together.
then
the
cargo
would
be
placed
on
the
boat.
there's
no
--
it
didn't
always
stay
together.
sometime
it
came
off
in
pieces.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
at
the
pier,
the
container
is
taken
off
the
truck
chassis.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
by
the
longshoremen.
with
a
crane.
it's
lifted
off
the
truck
chassis;
put
on
the
ground
in
the
staging
area.
then
it's
moved
to
the
ship;
put
on
the
ship
and
on
the
other
end,
it's
taken
off,
put
in
the
staging
area,
picked
up
by
the
trucker,
and
moved
off.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
yes.
it
did.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
the
record
indicates
that
with
close
coordination,
sometimes
the
container
can
be
delivered
within
an
hour
or
two
before
the
ship
sails.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
and
sometimes,
a
week
or
more.
on
the
import
side,
the
same
occurrence
happens.
when
the
product
comes
off
in
break-bulk
form
--
some
of
it
going
to
greensboro,
north
carolina,
for
example,
might
be
on
this
side
of
the
pier.
some
of
it
going
to
the
same
location
may
be
a
mile
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
terminal.
when
the
trucking
company
comes
and
picks
it
up,
not
only
has
he
waited
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
well,
the
seaport
terminal
company
with
the
crane.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
well,
i
think
the
longshore
workers.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
there
is
a
truck
chassis.
it's
two
wheels
with
a
rod
in
between.
it's
built
to
fit
the
container;
and
when
they
take
it
off
the
ship,
it's
dropped
right
onto
the
chassis,
as
i
understand
it,
and
moved
and
parked
in
the
holding
area.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
the
container
sits
on
a
wheel
base.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
it
very
seldom
sits
on
a
flat
bed,
a
regular
flat
bed
of
a
car.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
it
becomes
the
trailer.
or
in
the
case
of
the
railroad
train,
it
becomes
part
of
the
flatcar.
the
containers
are
sometimes
taken
to
the
flatcar
and
put
on
there;
and
the
rail
siding
is
right
on
the
pier.
and
shipped
off.
and
of
course,
sometimes
those
containers
by
rail
are
taken
to
another
deconsolidation
point,
and
unloaded.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
at
that
point.
they
do.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
well,
they
were
clearly
in
the
record
before
the
board
and
found
by
the
board.
the
court
of
appeals
slid
over
the
factual
findings
by
saying
that
the
test
that
was
applied
by
the
board;
that
is,
this
work
is
traditionally
related
to
truckers'
work
--
was
a
test
that
was
developed
before
an
analysis
of
the
facts.
when
in
reality,
that
conclusion
was
based
on
these
factual
developments.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
yes,
sir.
i
certainly
believe
they
do.
they
did.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
conclusion
the
board
reached
as
to
what
these
facts
showed
was
a
focus
of
a
test
that
prevented
the
board
from
looking
at
all
of
these
facts;
but
a
close
reading
of
the
administrative
law
judge's
decisions
and
the
board's
decisions
indicates
that
it
very
carefully
looked
at
the
sequential
order
of
the
pilferage,
the
breakage
of
cargo
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
they
never
consistently
did
that,
your
honor,
until
about
1975.
on
occasion,
the
board
held
as
a
bargaining
tactic
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
they
did
it
differently
in
different
places.
in
new
york,
for
example
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
alan
lips
well,
certainly,
we
are.
i
thought
you
asked
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
no.
i
misunderstood
you,
your
honor.
the
ila
in
different
ports
apply
the
rules
differently.
but
in
almost
no
case
did
the
ila
consistently
in
any
one
port
apply
the
rules.
the
ila
never
really
took
command
of
all
less-than-container
load
work
or
all
discharge
work
on
the
import
side.
occasionally
they
would
enforce
the
rules.
up
until
about
1973
or
'74,
and
then
when
the
dublin
supplement
was
negotiated,
at
that
point
they
put
a
lock
on
everything.
and
they
said
at
that
point,
50
miles
is
a
logical
limitation
on
our
work.
it's
purely
arbitrary.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
under
the
rules,
the
container
generally
was
left
alone;
was
not
stripped
and
restuffed
on
the
port.
under
the
rules,
in
the
port
of
baltimore,
with
respect
to
the
dolphin
case,
and
on
occasion,
well,
with
respect
to
the
conex
case,
the
longshoremen,
on
occasion,
stripped
the
less-than-container
load
goods
from
the
container
and
restuffed
it,
if
it
was
loaded
within
the
50
miles.
if
it
was
loaded
beyond
the
50
miles
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
the
board
in
the
associated
case
on
the
import
side,
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
the
union
was
only
aware
of
or
only
took
action
against
about
7
or
8
containers
over
a
period
of
a
two-year
period.
they
actually
levied
fines
over
containers
that
were
stripped
in
violation
of
the
rules
on
the
import
side.
now,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
i
know
of
that
breaks
down
the
numbers
of
containers
in
the
port
of
new
york
on
the
export
side,
for
example,
and
says
that
those
were
full
shippers
loads;
a
certain
number
of
them
were
loaded
outside
the
50-mile
rule;
some
were
loaded
within
the
50-mile
rule.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
the
fines
were
levied
against
the
steamship
companies
which
then
turned
to
our
clients
and
said
we
don't
have
any
contractual
basis
to
make
you
reimburse
us,
but
we're
going
to
tell
you,
if
you
don't
reimburse
us,
we
won't
give
you
any
more
containers.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
because
the
ila's
real
dispute
is
with
the
trucker
that's
doing
this
work;
and
the
only
way
it
can
get
at
the
trucker
and
force
this
work
back
on
the
pier,
is
through
the
economic
pressure
against
the
sea-carrier.
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
why,
that
if
the
ila
says,
as
it
admits,
that
the
full
shippers
load
containers
we
don't
want.
we
have
abandoned
that
work.
it
can
leave.
then
those
containers,
let's
say
100
of
them
in
a
week,
leave
the
pier,
the
ila's
given
up
on
those
containers,
and
all
of
a
sudden
because
they're
stopped
within
50
miles
and
converted
to
road
equipment
for
some
good
business
reason,
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
union
is
prejudiced
in
some
way.
they've
lost
their
work,
they
claim.
it's
illogical.
once
they've
given
up
that
work,
it's
gone;
and
the
fact
that
it's
stripped
within
50
miles,
doesn't
convert
it
back
to
their
work.
they've
lost
nothing
more
than
they
lost
when
they
let
it
off
the
pier
to
begin
with.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
well,
with
respect
to
the
rules,
it
begins
the
day
they're
published
and
declared
to
be
enforceable
against
all
the
trucking
companies.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
the
activity
that
is
the
secondary
boycott
activity
is
where
the
sea-carrier
says
to
the
trucking
company
we
will
not
give
you
any
more
containers
unless
you
agree
to
our
superimposed
unilateral
condition
to
not
strip
these
containers
within
50
miles.
mr.
j.
alan
lips
yes,
sir.
we
believe
--
mr.
j.
alan
lips
we
believe
that
the
existence
of
the
contract
itself
has
a
coercive
effect
on
business.
