only
because
there's
only
one
of
each.
justice

mr.
wallace,
you're
telling
us
that
the
court
decided
the
right-to-control
issue
erroneously,
or
are
you
telling
us
that
it
was
wrong
to
get
into
the
issue
at
all?
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
the
right
to
control
issue
is
not
really
relevant?
justice
potter
stewart
these
were
customer
decisions.
not
employer
decisions.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
on-going
antitrust
litigation
involving
the
ownership
of
the
containers
by
the
shipping
companies?
justice
potter
stewart
private?
or
government?
justice
potter
stewart
having
to
do
with
the
ownership
of
the
containers
by
the
shipping
companies.
justice
potter
stewart
how
was
that
traffic
handled
before
containerization?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
it
would
just
go
loose.
justice
potter
stewart
the
consolidator
would
take
less
than
truck
load
shipments
and
put
them
together
as
a
truck
load,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
he
get
them
to
the
pier.
justice
potter
stewart
by
truck
--
justice
potter
stewart
loose
in
the
truck.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
when
he
got
to
the
pier,
what
would
happen?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
what
happens
is
he
consolidates
it
in
the
container.
justice
potter
stewart
he
takes
the
container
to
the
pier.
and
what
happens
at
the
pier?
justice
potter
stewart
by
whom?
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it,
before
containerization,
that
pier
work
by
the
longshoremen
took
hours.
did
it?
or
days?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
it's
just
a
matter
of
lifting
the
filled
container
aboard
the
ship.
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
which
i
gather
can
be
done
in
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
time.
justice
potter
stewart
as
against
several
hours
--
or
days
--
of
loading.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
this
what
you
were
complaining
about?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that's
one
of
the
things
you
were
complaining
about.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
you're
telling
me
they
didn't
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
your
contention
that
the
entering
into
the
agreement
by
the
shipping
companies
and
the
labor
union
was
a
violation
of
8(e)
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
absence
of
any
activity.
justice
potter
stewart
owned
or
leased?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gleason,
are
those
figures
the
figures
of
ila
work?
or
total
work
performed
in
stripping
and
stuffing?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
so
this
does
not
include
the
number
of
hours
performed
at
the
consolidators'
places
of
business.
