justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
litigation
involving
the
shipping
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
rules
violating
the
shipping
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
where
they
presently
stand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
suggesting
that
we
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
loads
it
today?
who
loads
the
container
aboard
the
truck
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
i
mean,
what
workers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
longshoremen
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
sometimes,
it's
the
actual
trailer,
isn't
it?
the
container
becomes
a
trailer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
then
becomes
the
trailer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
any
event,
the
workers
who
load
--
whether
it's
a
train
or
a
flatcar.
whatever
it
may
be.
they
are
longshoremen
at
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'd
like
to
know
is
after
the
dublin
supplement,
and
when
you
have
a
container
that
comes
from
less
than
50
miles
from
the
port,
what
happens
to
that
container
when
it
gets
to
the
port?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
occasion,
you
say.
how
often
did
they
do
that?
does
the
record
tell
us?
is
this
the
regular
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
the
fines
were
levied,
not
against
your
client,
but
against
the
steamship
companies.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
you
accept
the
findings
of
the
board.
i
take
it
that
you
think
it's
a
question
of
law
that
the
board
resolved
when
it
said
that
this
work
in
dispute
did
not
traditionally
belong
to
the
longshoremen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
they
said
that
there
were
two
different
markets;
and
two
different
traditional
ways
of
doing
things.
and
the
consolidator's
business
was
traditionally
a
separate
business
and
never
was
the
longshoremen's
business.
is
that
what
they
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
accept
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
consolidators
business
had
started
a
hundred
years
ago,
and
had
been
just
accepted
by
the
longshoremen?
they
consolidated
in
the
sense
they
had
boxes
and
crates
and
they
would
take
little
packages
and
put
them
into
bigger
boxes;
and
a
lot
of
things
that
used
to
have
been
done
on
the
pier
wasn't
done
there
anymore.
and
it's
been
going
on
for
a
hundred
years.
and
then
this
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
still
say
that
this
was
a
work
preservation
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
had
been
going
on
this
way
for
a
hundred
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
long
as
they
had
done
it
a
hundred
years
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
satisfied
with
the
result
in
the
conex
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
and
this
result
would
rule
that
situation,
too,
i
take
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
chairman
fanning
--
didn't
he
join
to
concur
with
the
board
in
the
conex
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
did.
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
dissented
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
seemed
to
think
there
was
a
difference
between
the
two
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
came
to
change
his
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
--
and
maybe
you
just
gave
up
some
of
this
--
but
why
wouldn't
the
reasoning
that
you
use
apply
equally
beyond
the
50-mile
line?
maybe
just
a
matter
of
negotiation,
you
limit
your
claim
there.
but
i
think
--
would
you
just
address
yourself
a
little
bit
to
the
50-mile?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
would
a
shipper
ever
go
to
a
consolidator
or
a
forwarder
rather
than
taking
it
down
to
the
pier
unless
there
was
some
real
--
he
was
paying
for
it.
there's
obviously
a
market
for
their
services.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
to
evade
the
50-mile
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gleason,
i
still
have
a
little
problem
with
the
economics
of
the
situation.
does
the
--
the
ultimate
rates
are
fixed.
aren't
they?
i
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
shipper
whether
he
goes
through
a
consolidator
--
has
the
stuffing
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
how
do
you
view
the
court
of
appeals
differing
with
the
board
on
what
work
was
traditionally
within
the
longshoremen's
jurisdiction
and
what
was
traditionally
within
the
forwarders
or
consolidators
business?
is
that
--
do
you
think
that's
a
factual
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think,
then,
it
should
be
reviewed
on
a
substantial
evidence
basis
by
the
board?
by
the
court
of
appeals?
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
error
did
they
make?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
this
particular
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
applied
the
right
test,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
say
they
applied
--
they
came
out
with
the
wrong
result,
but
they
didn't
purport
to
you
some
other
test,
the
wrong
test
in
reviewing
the
board,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
haven't
we
said
that
really
the
courts
of
appeals
ought
to
be
the
final
word
on
evidentiary
things?
on
factual
findings
about
the
board?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
say
they
applied
the
wrong
standard
in
reviewing
--
