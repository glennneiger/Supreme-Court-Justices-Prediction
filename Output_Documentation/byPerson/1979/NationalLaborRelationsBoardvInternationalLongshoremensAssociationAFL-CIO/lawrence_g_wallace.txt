mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
set
aside
the
decisions
and
orders
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
two
separate
cases
which
are
the
most
recent
in
a
series
of
board
decisions
dealing
with
the
validity
under
the
anti-boycotting
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
various
provisions
and
applications
of
the
rules
on
containers
which
are
in
the
east
coast
labor
contract
between
the
respondent
union
and
the
shipping
companies
governs
major
ports
on
the
east
coast.
the
board
decisions,
in
our
view,
represent
a
consistent
pattern
of
factual
findings,
inferences,
and
conclusions;
and
prior
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
board
decisions
had
been
upheld
by
three
courts
of
appeals
in
various
applications;
and
indeed,
this
court
had
denied
certiorari
in
one
of
those
cases,
the
conex
case,
a
leading
case,
that
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
decided.
the
court
below,
in
our
view,
drew
different
factual
inferences
from
the
board;
and
on
the
basis
of
those
inferences,
rejected
its
conclusions
thereby
resulting
in
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
which
requires
resolution
by
late
spring
or
early
summer
if
the
negotiations
for
the
new
labor
contract
are
to
proceed
since
we
now
have
conflicting
views
expressed
by
the
courts
of
appeals
with
respect
to
the
rules
on
containers
in
cases
that
indeed
involved
the
same
rules
as
applied
to
the
port
of
new
york.
the
particular
incidents
that
led
to
the
refusals
to
deal
at
issue
here
involved
the
consolidation
of
less
than
container
load
cargo
into
containers
by
freight
forwarders
in
the
port
of
new
york
and
so-called
shortstopping,
which
was
the
stripping
of
containers
as
the
unloading
is
called,
that
were
full
shipper's
load
incoming
cargo,
that
were
stripped
by
truckers
in
baltimore
and
hampton
roads
port
areas.
in
both
instances
these
incidents
were
performed
within
50
miles
of
the
port,
and
the
essence
of
the
rules
on
containers
in
the
collective
agreement,
as
here
pertinent,
is
an
attempt
to
reserve
to
the
members
of
the
responding
union
all
stuffing
and
stripping
of
containers
within
50
miles
of
the
port;
either
by
requiring
duplication
of
the
work
or
by
imposing
prohibitive
fines
found
by
the
board
in
this
case
to
have
the
effect
of
requiring
a
boycott
or
by
the
explicit
requirement
of
the
refusal
to
deal
with
the
offending
companies.
and
the
essence
of
the
board's
holding
is
that
in
this
respect
the
rules
overreach;
go
beyond
work
preservation
to
an
attempt
to
acquire
work
that
had
traditionally
been
performed
by
others.
the
distinction
between
primary
and
secondary
activity
that
has
been
drawn
by
this
court
in
the
national
woodwork
and
pipefitters
cases.
as
the
board
viewed
what
had
occurred
here,
the
respondent
union
was
attempting
to
compensate
for
the
increase
in
productivity
caused
by
containerization
and
for
the
reduction
in
manhours
therefore
required
on
the
docks
by
attempting
to
take
away
work
traditionally
done
by
others.
in
essence,
the
board's
findings
are
that
there
have
traditionally
been
two
markets
performing
related
but
separate
functions,
depending
on
which
market
the
shipper
chose
to
utilize.
in
some
instances,
the
shipper
would
send
goods
directly
to
the
pier
loosely
to
be
handled
by
the
longshoremen
and
loaded
or
unloaded
that
way
and
picked
up
at
the
pier.
in
many
other
instances,
they
worked
both
prior
to
and
since
containerization
through
what
had
been
known
as
freight
forwarders
or
freight
agents
whose
function
was
to
sort
and
consolidate
cargo
to
provide
for
its
expedition,
to
provide
for
its
sequential
handling
at
the
pier,
which
would
result
in
faster
loading,
less
time
that
it
would
be
subject
to
damage
or
assessed
on
the
pier;
and
sequential
unloading
at
the
port
of
its
destination.
and
there
had
indeed
been
an
evolution
of
the
use
of
containers
which
we've
recounted
in
some
detail
in
our
reply
brief
prior
to
the
use
of
containerized
ships
which
has
been
the
big
advance
in
technology
and
which
has
to
a
large
extent,
made
the
old
cargo
method
of
loading
and
unloading
ships
obsolete.
and
all
during
this
evolutionary
process
and
indeed
in
the
early
years
of
the
use
of
container
ships,
the
same
breakdown
in
work
functions
has
existed
and
been
carried
forward
until
the
response
in
these
rules
on
containers.
something
of
this
background
and
traditions
of
functional
differentiation
in
the
industry
will
be
elaborated
by
mr.
lips
who
will
be
arguing
next.
now,
as
the
board
viewed
the
case,
and
as
we
view
it
now,
of
course,
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
respondent
union
to
seek
to
preserve
the
aspect
of
the
work
they
have
traditionally
performed
the
on-pier
stuffing
and
stripping
of
containers
on
behalf
of
shippers
who
choose
to
deliver
their
cargo
without
the
services
of
these
middlemen,
the
consolidators
or
freight
forwarders.
they
would
have
a
right
to
take
action
against
their
employers
if
the
employers
were
to
subcontract
the
work
that
they
had
traditionally
done
on
the
pier,
they
might
also
seek
to
induce
their
employers
to
take
measures
to
attract
more
business
in
this
way
by
perhaps
having
the
steamship
companies
make
available,
if
they
saw
fit
to,
trucks
to
carry
the
goods
to
the
pier
and
schedule
the
on-pier
loading
of
containers
in
a
way
that
would
attract
more
of
the
business
to
the
area
where
the
respondent
union
has
traditionally
done
their
work.
but
the
rules
on
containers
go
considerably
beyond
this
kind
of
measured
and
proper
response
under
the
labor
act
and
include,
at
least
as
an
object
which
is
enough
under
section
8(b)(4)
and
under
the
court's
decision
in
pipefitters,
the
acquisition
of
the
areas
of
work
that
have
traditionally
been
performed
by
others.
they
are,
at
least
within
the
50-mile
zone,
an
effort
to
say
that
only
the
on-pier
work
can
use
the
new
technology;
and
those
that
have
traditionally
engaged
in
the
off-pier
practices
must
be
denied
the
benefits
of
the
new
technology.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
couldn't
agree
more
with
that
suggestion,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
board
has
heard
extensive
evidence
about
this
industry
in
case
after
case
and
necessarily
has
more
cumulative
information
about
the
background
of
this
industry
and
the
practices
than
any
reviewing
court
of
appeals
has
been
favored
with
and
has
drawn
its
inferences
accordingly
in
what
we
believe
to
be
a
consistent
pattern
of
decisions.
and
with
proper
deference
to
the
factual
inferences
drawn
by
the
board,
there
would
have
been
a
consistent
pattern
of
court
of
appeals
decisions
and
really
no
need
for
this
court
to
be
drawn
into
the
area.
but
there're
only
the
two
places
where
uniformity
of
result
can
be
expected
the
board
or
this
court,
in
the
circumstances
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
there
are
times
when
the
board's
pattern
of
decisions
may
not
be
as
consistent
as
it
has
been
in
this
particular
area,
but
here
there
has
been
a
consistent
pattern.
and
i
do
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
faulting
the
board
for
ignoring
the
precontainerization
work
traditions
of
the
industry.
the
board's
opinions
refer
quite
specifically
to
the
precontainerization
background.
we
have
set
out
on
page
20,
and
also
on
pages
21
and
22,
of
our
brief,
some
excerpts
from,
first,
the
conex
opinion
on
which
the
board
specifically
relied
in
the
new
york
case
before
the
court
now,
in
which
it
talks,
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
paragraph
on
page
20,
about
the
precontainerization
background;
and
then
in
the
second
sentence,
that
the
advent
of
containerization
didn't
change
this.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
administrative
law
judges
opinion
adopted
by
the
board
in
the
hampton
roads
case
that
is
also
before
the
court.
first,
at
the
bottom
of
page
21,
there
is
discussion
of
the
precontainerization
background;
and
at
the
top
of
page
22,
the
advent
of
containerization
did
not
change
this.
so
the
board
having
found
the
work
traditions
to
be
what
they
have
been
really
was
at
the
end
of
the
case
as
far
as
they
were
concerned.
the
case
seemed
to
be
ruled
by
principles
this
court
has
established.
the
court
of
appeals
having
rejected
the
board's
factual
conclusions,
went
on
to
reach
more
specifically
the
interrelated
question
of
right
to
control
the
work
and
whether
the
employer
had
the
right
to
control
the
work
that's
in
issue
here.
and
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
this
respect
as
well.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
national
woodwork
with
respect
to
the
right
to
control
is
that
in
national
woodwork,
the
employer
had
the
unilateral
choice
whether
to
install
the
prefinished
doors
or
whether
to
engage
in
his
traditional
practice;
and
this
case
much
more
closely
resembles
the
pipefitters
case
where
customer
choices
were
directing
the
employer's
course
of
conduct.
here
it's
the
shippers
who
are
choosing
to
use
the
consolidation
or
deconsolidation
services
of
the
middlemen.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
am
telling
you
it
was
erroneously
decided.
perhaps
it's
an
issue
that
the
court
should
have
asked
for
the
board's
views
on
initially,
but
the
board
did
brief
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
argue
it
because
it
seemed
clear
to
counsel
for
the
board
--
and
we've
briefed
it
in
this
court
--
that
the
case
is
controlled
by
pipefitters.
and
in
any
event
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
pipefitters,
there
wasn't
a
right
to
control,
as
we
view
the
case;
and
therefore,
this
was
an
unlawful
boycott
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
board's
findings
and
factual
inferences
about
the
work
traditions
in
the
industry.
the
board
didn't
have
to
explicitly
state
anything
about
the
right
to
control.
but
the
issues
do
have
a
close
interrelationship,
and
we
think
pipefitters
governed
it,
and
we
told
the
court
of
appeals
as
much.
and
in
addition,
there
is
a
new
wrinkle
on
right
to
control
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
the
shipping
act
and
the
federal
maritime
commission
interpretation
of
the
shipping
act
make
it
clear
that
there
is
no
right
to
control
in
the
manner
exercised
by
the
rules
at
issue
here
because
the
rules
amount
to
a
discrimination
between
customers
within
the
50-mile
zone
and
customers
beyond
the
50-mile
zone
of
exactly
the
kind
that
the
shipping
act
prohibits.
and
curiously
enough,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
which
did
not
address
the
shipping
act
question,
the
court
relies
very
strongly
in
a
footnote
in
its
opinion
on
the
distinction
between
them
within
the
50-mile
zone
and
those
beyond
the
50-mile
zone.
the
very
violation
of
the
shipping
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
on
page
51(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
in
footnote
177
to
avoid
what
the
court
itself
characterizes
as
the
reduction
ad
absurdum
of
its
opinion,
it
relies
on
the
violation
of
the
shipping
act
to
show
the
reasonableness
of
the
response
that
has
been
adopted
here.
while
the
fact
is,
were
it
not
for
the
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
shipping
act,
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals,
likening
the
loading
and
unloading
of
containers
to
the
loading
and
unloading
of
a
ship's
hold
would
permit
respondents
to
follow
containers
all
over
the
country,
and
to
insist
on
monopolization
of
the
loading
and
unloading
of
containers
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
didn't
really
address
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
perhaps
that's
the
suggestion
to
avoid
what
the
court
would
say
would
be
an
absurd
result,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
that
is
reliance
on
a
discrimination
that
violates
the
shipping
act.
we
have
here
the
unusual
circumstances
of
two
separate
federal
agencies
having
decided
that
these
rules
are
a
violation
of
two
different
federal
statutes.
which
is
a
heavy
burden
indeed
for
the
rules
to
bear.
of
course,
it's
always
the
labor
act
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
but
i
don't
think
it
should
be
viewed
in
isolation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
now
is
litigation
to
review
the
maritime
commission's
decisions
in
these
cases.
we
refer
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
we
refer
to
this
on
page
12
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
have
not
yet
been
decided
by
any
court,
but
commission
has
made
its
determination,
and
there's
no
primary
jurisdiction
problem.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
a
pending
petition
in
this
court,
mr.
justice,
which
the
court
has
not
acted
on
from
a
third
circuit
case
which
is
an
antitrust
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
private
case.
the
government's
views
had
been
requested
by
the
court,
and
we
filed
a
brief
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
having
to
do
with
the
"concerted
refusal
to
deal"
with
containers
owned
by
the
shipping
companies,
pursuant
to
these
rules.
we
suggested
in
our
filing
that
the
validity
of
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
should
be
decided
first.
now,
the
customer
choices
that
are
involved
here
are
based
on
important
economic
considerations
which
are
a
part
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
to
which
the
court
referred
in
pipefitters.
the
rules
in
the
application
we
are
talking
about
now
really
threaten
to
eliminate
the
intermodal
advantages
of
containers
which
can
be
affixed
directly
to
a
truck
chassis
and
moved
from
there
directly
into
the
ship's
hold
and
vice
versa,
and
to
eliminate
the
services
of
the
off-pier
indoor
consolidation
and
deconsolidation
business
with
the
advantages
of
expedition
and
protection
against
damage
and
theft
that
experience
has
shown
that
they
provide,
and
that
has,
in
the
market
place,
attracted
a
large
share
of
the
business
to
them.
and
one
further
consideration
bearing
on
these
economic
advantages
is
that
in
national
woodwork,
both
the
court
and
mr.
justice
harlan
in
concurrence
emphasized
the
lack
of
congressional
guidance
in
this
area
other
than
congress's
traditional
reliance
on
the
bargaining
process
and
the
hope
that
the
problems
of
technological
innovation
will
be
worked
out
there.
there
has
been
some
change
in
this
situation
since
the
decision
in
national
woodwork.
there
is
an
act
that
we
refer
to
on
page
52
of
our
brief
in
footnote
35,
the
national
productivity
and
quality
of
working
life
act
of
1975,
which
states
as
the
policy
of
the
government
to
stimulate
a
high
rate
of
productivity
growth
and
which
provides
that
the
laws
of
the
united
states
shall
be
so
interpreted
as
to
give
full
force
and
effect
to
this
policy.
now,
this
was
not
relied
on
by
the
board
in
arriving
at
its
interpretation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
perhaps
not
in
that
case.
but
i
think
that
this
act
and
the
policies
of
this
act
should
certainly
be
taken
into
account
by
a
reviewing
court
before
it
rejects
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
when
the
board's
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
policy
of
this
act,
and
a
rejection
of
that
interpretation
would
seem
to
be
contrary
to
the
policy
of
this
act.
congress
has
provided
further
guidance
than
was
available
to
the
court
in
national
woodwork.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
result
in
that
case
was
incorrect.
the
board
is
living
with
national
woodwork.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
not
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board
did
not
rely
on
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
board's
interpretation
on
the
national
labor
relations
act
turns
out
to
be
consistent
with
the
policy
of
this
act;
and
before
a
reviewing
court
rejects
that
interpretation,
it
should
take
the
policy
of
this
act
into
account,
to
the
extent
the
reviewing
court
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i'm
not
making
that
suggestion
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
board's
interpretation
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
even
without
this
act
in
the
picture,
should
have
been
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals;
and
this
is
just
another
reason
that
corroborates
the
reviewing
court
should
not
reject
this
interpretation
when
the
rejection
would
result
in
contravention
of
this
policy
as
well.
but
i
certainly
am
not
suggesting
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
resolution
of
the
case
is
very
important
to
labor
peace
in
the
east
coast
ports
and
the
ability
to
negotiate
the
new
contracts
this
summer.
and
that
was
the
basis
of
our
expedited
petition
to
this
court
very
shortly
after
the
court
of
appeals
denied
rehearing.
so
this
statute,
as
well
as
the
other
reasons
i
have
suggested,
seem
to
us
to
indicate
that
the
court
should
uphold
the
board's
determination
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
answer
to
containerization
to
be
a
boycott
agreement
adopted
at
a
bargaining
table
at
which
many
of
those
most
profoundly
affected,
the
shippers,
the
truckers,
the
consolidators,
and
deconsolidators,
and
all
of
their
employees,
were
not
represented.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
just
two
or
three
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
case,
is
that
the
board
dealt
only
with
the
incidents
that
were
before
it,
and
did
not
make
comprehensive
findings
about
the
apparent
discrepancies
between
what
the
rules
provide
and
what
we
are
told
are
the
practices
under
the
rules.
as
we
point
out
on
pages
9
and
10
of
our
reply
brief,
the
rules
in
terms
apply
to
containers
owned,
leased,
or
used
by
carriers;
and
indeed,
there's
testimony
in
this
case
that
their
application
was
not
restricted
to
those
owned
by
the
carriers;
and
findings
in
conex.
i'll
recount
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief
to
the
same
effect.
i
don't
know
why
the
respondent
union
emphasizes
so
strongly
that
the
rules
are
restricted
to
those
owned
by
the
carriers
because
those
are
the
ones
that
are
facilities
of
the
common
carrier
as
to
which
obligations
under
the
shipping
act
cause
special
problems;
rather
than,
the
ones
where
it's
easier
to
justify
the
discriminations
that
the
rules
apparently
require.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
the
agreement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board
found
it
to
be
an
8(e)
violation.
that
is
correct.
and
under
that
agreement,
there
is
a
requirement
that
those
stuffed
within
the
50
miles
and
certain
others,
that
weren't
at
issue
in
this
case,
that
extend
beyond
the
50
miles,
be
stripped
and
restuffed
at
the
pier
or
a
heavy
penalty
will
be
assessed.
it
has
the
effect
of
requiring
the
cessation
of
business.
now,
it's
true
that
those
either
weren't
detected
in
some
instances;
or
if
they
were
detected,
the
rules
weren't
applied.
we're
told
that
there
have
been
payoffs.
i
can't
really
testify
as
to
what
has
happened
here
and
answer
these
factual
questions.
but
the
fact
is
that
is
the
agreement
that
the
board
has
held
to
be
an
8(e)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
but
i
would
say
principally
a
factual
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
concluding
that
the
board
didn't
have
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
of
appeals?
they
applied
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
purported
to
use
the
traditional
test
and
to
comply
with
this
court's
decisions,
as
did
the
courts
that
reached
the
opposite
result
in
the
other
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
position
that
we
took
in
opposing
certiorari
in
the
conex
case.
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
but
now,
we
are
faced
with
two
courts
of
appeals
purporting
to
apply
the
same
standards
and
reaching
contrary
results
about
the
port
of
new
york.
and
the
very
same
rules
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
a
need
for
resolution
because
of
the
pressing
labor
situation
in
those
ports.
and
we
think
that
this
court
errs
in
--
it
did
apply
the
standards
that
the
board
should
apply.
but
those
are
not
the
standards
that
a
court
of
appeals
should
apply.
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
a
sense
underisking
a
reevaluation
of
the
facts
under
standards
that
the
board
should
apply,
and
it
disagrees
with
the
inferences
drawn
by
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
in
that
sense,
i
do.
i
do.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we've
recounted
on
wage
3
of
our
reply
brief
the
use
of
consolidation
boxes
and
container
of
various
kinds
prior
to
the
advent
of
containers
that
we
are
now
dealing
with;
and
the
fact
that
the
history
was
that
that
kind
of
sorting,
as
was
found
in
the
conex
case,
was
done
indoors,
off
the
pier,
by
these
freight
forwarders
and
were
not
unpacked
and
reloaded
on
the
piers.
that
was
traditionally
the
work
of
the
freight
forwarders
and
consolidators
as
the
board
found.
