mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
mr.
chief
justice.
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
stand
before
this
court
this
morning
on
behalf
of
the
steamship
industry
operating
in
the
north
atlantic
range
to
state
to
you
that
we
made
an
agreement
with
the
ila
in
1968;
that
we
made
additional
rules
of
enforcement
in
1973;
that
we
fully
believed
then
and
believe
now,
we
had
fully
resolved
a
critical
issue
of
automation;
and
that
we
had
done
so
under
the
rules
set
forth
by
this
court
in
national
woodworkers
and
reinforced
by
this
court
in
pipefitters,
or
restated
by
this
court
in
pipefitters.
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
ask
certain
questions
initially.
whose
automation?
whose
job
depletion?
whose
job
loss?
whose
labor
relations?
and
i
think
that
under
the
principles
of
national
woodwork,
we
find
that
all
of
these
questions
must
be
answered
on
the
facts
found
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
favor
of
the
longshoremen.
and
that
the
industry
which
suffered
strike
and
strife
in
1968,
and
in
1971,
and
in
1977,
in
order
to
resolve
this
issue,
should
be
held
to
have
conformed
to
the
traditions
of
national
woodwork,
and
to
have
applied
that
law
correctly.
it
is
our
position
before
this
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
aptly
and
properly
decided
this
issue
as
a
question
of
law.
as
it
stated
below,
in
quoting
from
the
board's
brief,
the
board
now
seeks
to
make
this
a
factual
question.
the
petitioner's
real
complaint
is
with
the
board's
analytical
framework
and
not
its
findings
of
fact.
we
say
to
this
court,
and
to
your
honors,
that
there
is
such
error
of
law
in
this
case,
that
the
board
bears,
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
remanded
the
matter
back
to
the
board;
and
it
did
so
on
the
basis
of
the
ignoring
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
of
the
entire
issue
here.
let's
go
back.
what
is
the
work
of
longshoremen,
and
what
has
the
traditional
work
of
longshoremen
been?
from
the
time
of
the
phoenicians,
the
piece-by-piece
loading
and
unloading
of
ships
--
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
accept
all
of
the
findings
of
the
board,
and
we
say
--
and
there
is
no
issue
here.
because
we
know
what
longshoremen
did
before.
everyone
agrees
the
board
included
--
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
the
board
specifically
stated
in
various
cases.
you
can
look
at
the
conex
case
in
the
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge.
because
basically
the
conex
case
starts
this
whole
trilogy
of
cases,
although
the
conex
case
itself
is
not
before
this
court.
we
have
dolphin
and
san
juan
involving
the
port
of
new
york;
and
then
we
have
the
houston
associated
cases
involving
the
ports
of
baltimore
and
hampton
roads
--
all
applying
this
same
collective
bargaining
agreement
which,
as
i
said
earlier,
strike
and
strife
sought
to
resolve,
an
issue
where
tens
of
thousands
of
longshoremen
lost
their
work,
where
we
brought
in
beautiful,
new,
automated
ships,
where
we
wanted
to
pay
low
price
for
it,
and
where
we
were
compelled
by
strike
and
strife
to
seek
to
make
a
lawful,
proper
arrangement.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
yes,
your
honor
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
they
roughly
said
that.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
i
don't
accept
that
as
a
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
i
would
disagree
with
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
i
think
that
the
facts
upon
which
the
board
acted,
straight
upon
the
record,
indicated
one
basic
error
of
law.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
i
am
accepting
the
historical
findings
of
fact
of
the
board
which
say
that
the
longshoremen
did
the
work
initially;
that
the
consolidator
brought
down
the
cargo
piece
by
piece
for
the
longshoremen
to
stuff
it
and
strip
it;
and
i
quarrel
with
the
board's
starting
its
examination
into
this
matter
by
looking
at
what
happened
after
the
innovation
and
not
--
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
where
you
start
is
a
matter
of
law.
and
where
you
start
is
where
the
board
went
wrong.
because
if
you
define,
as
the
board
did;
if
you
define
the
work
after
the
innovation,
obviously
there
is
no
such
thing
as
job
preservation.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
it
would
be
the
same,
your
honor,
as
the
situation
in
national
woodworkers
--
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
where
they
made
doors
in
factories
for
years
and
years
before
that.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
i
would
say
it's
a
work
preservation
--
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
so
long
as
the
longshoremen
were
those
who
did
the
work
prior
to
the
innovation.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
the
longshoremen
did
it,
yes;
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
before
that
as
well
on
a
piece-by-piece
basis.
and
you
must
bear
in
mind,
your
honors,
the
principles
that
you
enunciated
national
woodworker,
where
you
said
what
is
the
threat
of
displacement
here?
tens
of
thousands
of
jobs
have
been
lost.
obviously,
we
welcome
the
advantage
of
innovation,
and
obviously,
we
have
had
the
advantages
of
innovation.
because
what
is
the
philosophy
of
the
rules,
and
what
has
the
ila
said?
they
have
not
said
as
was
stated
here
everything
within
50
miles
of
the
pier
must
come
down
for
stuffing
and
stripping.
they
said
that
which
goes
to
the
beneficial
owner,
to
the
shipper,
or
the
consignee,
even
within
the
50-mile
limit,
may
go.
what
we
are
looking
for
is
that
which
might
reasonably
be
performed
on
the
pier
without
intruding
upon
this
innovation.
we
are
willing
to
give
you
80%;
but
in
return
for
the
millions
and
millions
of
manhours
of
lost
time,
and
in
return
for
giving
up
so
many
of
our
workers
and
their
livelihoods,
we
would
like
to
have
that
part
of
the
work
which
we
may
keep
on
a
practical
basis.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
it
does
not
intrude
on
this
technology
because
what
it
has
permitted
to
do
is
for
unions
and
management
to
sit
together
and
work
out
their
problems
without
the
union
saying,
as
it
may
say
here,
if
we
have
to
go
back
to
square
one,
we
say
may,
and
we
on
our
side
say
yea;
and
there
is
no
compromise
possible
because
we
don't
know
how
some
finder
somewhere
down
the
line
may
accept
any
compromise;
and
therefore,
the
only
alternative
appears
to
be
industrial
warfare.
and
we've
already
had
it
four,
five
six
times,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
what
we
wish
to
avoid.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
your
honor
--
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
i
think
that
the
common
law
of
the
industry
now
is
50
miles.
the
50-mile
rule
depends
upon
the
port
district.
it
started
out
because
the
port
of
new
york
district
was
a
50-mile
area
around
columbus
circle.
it
is
part
of
our
common
law,
and
i
think
100
would
be
no
good
and
i
think
52
miles
might
not
be
any
good.
that
was
not
the
deal
that
was
made.
but
we
have
--
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
pardon
me?
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
that's
also
in
the
record.
especially
with
respect
to
judge
wagman,
the
administrative
law
judge,
and
is
part
of
the
appendix
in
the
conex
case
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari.
and
it's
all
there.
as
you
know,
your
honor,
in
the
dolphin
and
san
juan
case,
there
are
very
few
findings
of
fact
because
most
of
our
factual
exhibits
were
rejected
by
the
court,
by
the
board,
on
the
grounds
that
they
would
determine
this
issue
on
the
conex
matter.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
you
will
find,
your
honor,
on
a
fair
reading
of
the
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
accepted
the
facts,
and
they
said
--
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
pardon
me?
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
well,
they
say
that
here,
your
honor;
whereas,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
said
there
are
no
issues
of
fact.
and
the
judge
ulyzanski
in
the
conex
case
said
there
are
no
issues
of
fact.
and
the
board
below
said
there
are
no
issues
of
fact.
we
know
that
the
work
of
longshoremen
is
just
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out.
in
the
caputo
case
and
in
the
pfeiffer
case,
that
the
work
of
the
longshoremen
today
includes
that
which
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
piece-by-piece
moving;
and
that
is,
the
stuffing
and
stripping
of
the
container.
and
i
suggest
that
the
determinations,
even
though
under
a
different
statute,
are
what
the
court
below
did
here;
and
that
is,
define
the
work
of
the
longshoremen
as
this
court
requires
it
to
do
under
national
woodwork
and
pipefitters.
mr.
constantine
p.
lambos
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
say
that
the
board
has
failed
to
take
those
rules
of
law,
laid
down
by
this
court
in
national
woodwork
and
in
pipefitters,
and
apply
them
to
the
facts
which
they
found.
and
had
they
done
so,
they
would
not
have
committed
the
error
which
we
say
was
corrected
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
remanding
the
matter
back
to
the
board.
