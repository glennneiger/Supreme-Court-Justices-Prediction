mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
first
thing
that
we
should
point
out
here
is
the
fact
that
what
are
we
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
the
rules
on
containers?
we
are
only
talking
about
containers
that
are
owned
or
leased
by
the
steamship
companies.
we
are
not
talking
about
containers
or
boxes
that
belong
to
the
shippers.
if
a
shipper
brings
down
a
box,
and
he
has
done
it,
or
a
consolidator
has
done
a
box
and
it's
his
box;
no
matter
where
it's
done
within
the
50-mile
radius
or
any
place
else,
it
goes
right
on
the
ship.
there
is
no
stopping
of
the
containers
if
they
belong
to
a
consolidator
a
shipper,
or
anybody
else.
the
only
thing
that
we
talked
about
are
those
containers
that
are
owned
and
leased
and
in
the
control
of
the
steamship
companies.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
owned
or
leased.
and
in
some
cases
your
honor,
even
used,
because
when
you
go
into
some
of
these
cases;
what
they
had
done,
some
of
the
companies,
the
consolidators
they
had
gone
out,
got
a
container
off
a
railroad
company,
and
they
came
back,
and
then
the
steamship
company
would
pick
up
the
lease
on
the
container.
and
most
of
these
containers
were
not
marked.
in
fact,
we
had
to
amend
the
rules
so
that
we
asked
the
steamship
companies
to
mark
those
containers
that
had
to
be
stripped
or
not
stripped.
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
contract
in
1968.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
those
containers
that
were
owned
by
the
steamship
company
and
also
those
containers
that
were
moving
to
the
consignee,
whether
it
was
outside
the
pier,
a
shippers
load,
or
whether
it
was
in
another
area.
they
indicated
only
those
containers
that
were
consolidated
containers
or
containers
that
had
to
be
stripped
that
were
going
to
go
within
the
50-mile
radius.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
well,
if
you
strip
the
container,
and
the
problem
we
have
is
we
had
to
protect;
we're
looking
to
protect
the
work
of
the
longshoremen,
i
the
longshoremen
strip
the
container
within
the
pier
area,
that
meant
work.
the
problem
was
that
the
moment
the
carrier
was
able
to
take
those
containers
and
give
them
out
to
consolidators
who
were
only
people
that,
the
record
is
clear,
that
only
came
into
business
after
containerization,
they
would
do
it
at
substandard
wages.
they
would
be
working
at
three,
four
dollars
an
hour,
and
therefore,
the
automated
carriers
would
be
paying
less
contributions
on
the
manhours
going
into
the
pension
and
welfare
funds
in
the
various
ports;
and
therefore,
put
the
conventional
operator
out
of
business.
now,
he
had
the
work
hours.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
your
honor,
if
its
a
shippers
load
or
its
a
container
that's
owned
by
the
consolidator
if
it's
his
container,
then
it
goes
right
on
the
ship.
now,
the
problem
you
have
with
some
of
the
steamship
lines
--
and
this
came
out
in
the
evidence
--
is
the
fact
that
one
of
the
consolidators
came
down
with
a
45-foot
container
and
brought
it
down
to
the
prmmi,
puerto
rican.
well,
a
45-foot
container
cannot
fit
in
a
slot
on
a
30
--
where
they
use
35-foot
containers.
so
therefore,
primmi
says
look,
we
can't
take
your
container.
the
only
way
we
can
take
your
container
is
strip
it
and
put
it
into
35-foot
containers.
but
basically,
if
that
consolidator
had
a
container,
and
it
was
two
of
the
same
containers,
one
was
owned
by
the
steamship
company
and
one
was
owned
by
the
consolidator
and
it
was
his
container,
and
it
was
a
roll-on,
roll-off
ship,
they'd
both
go
right
on
the
ship
without
handling.
now,
the
problem
we
have,
and
we
restricted
this
only
to
those
containers
that
were
owned
and
leased.
prior
to
containerization,
ford
motor
company
which
would
bring
down
and
pack
in
their
own
plant
--
they
have
a
consolidator
--
pack
great
big
cases
with
thousands
of
parts.
we
permit
those
to
go
through.
it
was
always
went
through,
and
we
still
permit
it
to
go
through.
we
don't
have
to
do
the
packing
of
those
containers.
in
fact,
in
one
of
the
cases
mentioned
in
the
brief
filed
by
tidewater
shipside
packing.
in
that
particular
case,
shipside
was
a
subsidiary
of
one
of
the
steamship
companies
under
the
contract,
and
they
were
packaging.
and
after
we
found
out
they
were
packaging
and
after
the
order,
we
submitted
an
affidavit
to
the
fourth
circuit
saying
that
the
rules
did
not
apply,
and
it
was
a
right
decision.
but
you've
got
to
remember
that
we
have
one-million
containers
in
the
port
of
new
york
comes
to
the
port.
now,
when
you
have
several
containers
that
are
not
marked,
certainly,
we're
going
to
have
a
problem
with
a
couple,
but
in
1968
when
we
sat
down
--
and
the
record
will
show,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
exhibit
no.
12,
at
page
464,
which
shows
the
manhours
--
it
was
not
until
1968,
when
the
rules
and
containers
came
in,
that
the
workforce
and
the
manhours
started
to
decline.
because
they
had
the
rules,
and
then
automation
went
full
start
ahead.
they
went
from
40
--
approximately,
i
think,
in
1968
--
was
approximately
44
million
man-hours
with
approximately
27
thousand
employees;
and
now,
today,
we
have
less
than
20
million
man-hours
and
we
have
less
than
12
thousand
employees.
now,
we
have
not
impeded
automation.
we
have
not
impeded
progress.
in
fact,
the
steamship
companies
have
made
billions
of
dollars.
if
you
look
just
at
the
times,
the
rate
of
pay
over
the
years,
with
the
savings
here.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
those
are
the
hours
in
the
port
of
new
york
alone.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
no.
your
honor,
i
think,
if
you
look.
i
think
the
story
of
consolidation
and
automation
is
pretty
well
spelled
out
in
an
article
called
waterfront
labor
response
to
technological
change,
a
tale
of
two
unions,
by
phillip
ross,
professor
ross.
and
i
think
he
takes
the
comparison
in
1970
--
he
made
this
study
--
and
he
compares
automation
on
the
east
coast
with
automation
on
the
west
coast.
and
in
that
--
just
a
quote
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes.
it
has
been
in
the
record.
it
was
in
the
record
in
the
conex
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
your,
honor,
the
problem
was
that
we
were
not
permitted
to
present
any
evidence
before
the
board
in
the
dolphin
case.
we
could
not
present
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
it's
referred
to
by
judge
wright.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
again,
this
was
not
presented
in
the
dolphin
case,
but
it
was
presented
in
the
conex
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
well,
the
board
here
takes
everything
that
goes
back
to
the
conex
case.
they
say
everything
is
the
facts
and
the
law
in
the
conex
case.
we
were
not
permitted
to
put
in
any
evidence
as
far
as
the
facts
and
the
history.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
the
purpose
is
to
know
who
owns
the
containers
and
whether
they
fell
within
the
rules.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
if
a
container
came
in
and
it
was
a
consolidator's
container,
then
they
would
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
work
was
done
within
the
50-mile
radius.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
if
it
was
done
within
the
50-mile
radius,
we
would
tell
the
company
that
this
was
a
violation;
we'd
have
to
strip
the
container.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
then
they
would
strip
the
container,
and
load
it
in
another
container.
but
the
union
was
against
--
the
union
over
the
years
was
against
this,
and
saying
hey,
you
know,
it's
wrong
to
give
these
containers
out
--
your
containers
out
--
to
the
consolidators.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
your
honor,
they
all
have
to
be
the
same
containers.
that
consolidated
container
that
you
are
talking
about
is
the
steamship
company's
container.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
what
we
have
tried
to
do,
is
stop
that
and
say
hey,
you're
giving
containers
out
to
consolidators
who
are
not
entitled
to
do
this
work.
if
a
consolidator
wants
to
bring
his
freight
down
to
the
pier,
let
him
bring
it
down
to
the
pier.
in
fact,
going
to
a
consolidator
is
an
additional
step
in
the
process
because
why
should
a
man
who
has
a
pieces
of
cargo,
five
cases,
and
he
has
it
within
a
50-mile
radius
--
why
should
he
take
it
and
bring
it
to
a
consolidator
where
there
can
be
pilferage
and
what
have
you
--
breakage
--
just
like
any
other
company.
and
then
take
it
from
the
consolidator
to
the
pier,
when
he
could
directly
take
it
from
his
place
of
business
directly
down
to
the
pier
to
the
longshoreman
where
then
he
could
load
it
into
the
container.
so
you
have
the
added
step
then
here.
this
was
make
work.
and
i
think
that
the
fact
is
--
and
i
go
back
to
professor
ross
--
that
he
said
1966
--
after
containerization
had
started
in
1959.
he
says
in
1966
the
percentage
of
general
cargo
moved
by
containers
in
new
york,
the
largest
port
in
the
country
was
under
3
percent.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
no.
they
have
special
containers.
they
have
their
own
containers.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so.
what
they
would
do
is,
if
they
have
a
container
that's
coming
in
on
a
ship
into
new
york
and
it
then
was
going
to
be
flown
to
california,
they
would
take
that
container
and
they
would
bring
it
over
to
the
airline;
and
probably
if
it
was
one
owner
and
it
was
his
container,
then
it
would
probably
either
be
stripped
over
there,
and
if
it
wasn't,
it
would
be
stripped
at
the
pier,
and
they
would
bring
a
container
over
and
load
it
in
it.
it
depends
on
who
owned
the
freight.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
put
on
an
airplane?
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
it's
going
outside
the
50-mile
radius.
it
would
go
right
through.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
sure.
but
the
problem
is
it's
going
outside
the
area.
it's
just
like
houff
here.
houff
had
containers.
he's
a
truckman.
he
came
down
to
take
those
containers
--
i
think
it's
several
hundred
miles
away.
there
was
no
objection.
but
what
he
did
was
instead
of
taking
them
and
delivering
them
to
the
consignee;
which
he
was
supposed
to
do
--
and
that's
the
agreement
that
was
made
with
the
steamship
lines
with
their
container
--
he
didn't
do
that.
he
stopped
down
the
street
and
then
stripped
the
container
with
his
people
where
it
could
have
very
well
been
stripped
at
the
pier,
with
ila
people
on
his
truck
and
taken
down
to
300
miles
away.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
containers
that
are
owned
and
leased
by
the
steamship
companies.
nobody
else.
and
certainly,
i
think
the
steamship
companies
are
quite
happy
with
the
fact
that
they
have
made
an
awful
lot
of
money.
and
the
problem
we
have
now,
is
the
new
ships
that
are
on
the
drawing
boards.
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
the
new
all-purpose
ships
that
are
coming
in?
i
think
it's
something
that
management
and
labor
--
it's
our
contract.
it's
the
work
that
we
normally
did
with
them.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
subcontractor
is
doing
the
work.
this
is
the
collective
bargaining
relationships
between
us
and
the
steamship
companies
only
over
their
containers
and
the
work
that
we
do
with
their
freight,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
with
all
of
the
facts
that
were
presented
in
the
conex
case
before
the
--
he
applied
the
law
because
he
said
if
you
didn't
apply
and
you
didn't
look
to
the
work
where
the
tradition
was,
then
you
could
never
have
work
preservation.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
was
in
the
--
he
did.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
difference
was
that
he
probably
came
about
to
understand
what
the
rules
were
about;
and
the
fact
that
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
we
have
here
is
that
we
had
a
decision
in
1970
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
ictc
case
which
said
this
work
is
the
longshoremen's;
and
it
upheld
the
rules.
now
between,
1970
and
this
case,
we
had
of
course
a
change
in
the
administration
at
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
had
a
new
general
counsel
who
came
in
and
took
a
different
position;
but
i
think
based
on
the
law,
i
think
there's
no
question
that
the
ila
did
this
in
good
faith;
and
it's
to
their
collective
bargaining
agreement
we're
looking
to,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
i
think
we
solved
that
problem,
your
honor,
in
saying
hey,
the
work
that
has
to
be
done
on
the
containers
that
are
owned
or
leased
by
the
steamship
carriers
--
we're
going
to
do
that
work.
if
the
new
consolidators
that
came
in
the
business,
and
they
have
their
own
containers
or
they
do
their
own
boxing
we'll
still
handle
those
containers
without
stripping.
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
accommodation
to
the
automation
and
the
operation
of
bringing
in
new
ships.
if
you
take
a
look
at
1968,
and
then
see
what's
going
on
now
--
and
in
caputo,
the
evidence
before
the
benefits
review
board
and
the
administrative
law
judge,
and
those
injury
cases
--
certainly
built
up
the
history.
and
i
think
you
have
--
judge
friendly
said
what
a
container
is
it's
only
part
of
the
hull
of
the
ship.
and
what
loading
is
and
unloading
of
that
container
is
a
sorting
of
cargo.
and
what
we
have
is
--
we
have
the
work
that's
being
done.
caputo.
today,
a
man
goes
on
an
automated
ship;
that
ship
can
be
loaded
and
discharged
within
no
more
than
16
hours.
now,
what
are
we
going
to
say?
the
longshoremen
only
have
the
loading
of
the
ship.
he's
not
going
to
work
the
rest
of
the
week.
when
we've
taken
all
of
those
containers
out,
put
them
all
into
the
yard.
he's
working
one
day
on
the
ship
loading
the
ship
or
discharging
the
ship.
tomorrow,
he's
working
on
the
containers.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
no.
your
honor.
i
think
here
we
have
--
we're
still
going
to
handle
that
container.
that
cargo
has
to
be
handled,
and
loaded,
and
unloaded
on
the
ship.
we're
not
talking
--
if
we
said
that
the
airplane,
as
you
pointed
out,
was
going
to
handle
all
the
cargo,
then
we
have
no
claim
to
that.
and
if
airplanes
are
going
to
handle
all
the
cargo
in
the
country
by
helicopter,
we're
out
of
business.
but
as
long
as
it
has
to
do
with
the
loading
and
unloading
of
cargo
on
a
ship,
i
think
that
we
have
the
right
to
get
a
piece
of
automation
and
all
the
money
that's
going
to
be
made
and
the
protection
and
the
jobs
of
longshoremen.
i
think
this
is
--
all
you're
doing
is
then
telling
a
person
that
comes
in,
and
he
has
a
big
workforce
well,
tomorrow,
you're
out
of
work.
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
these
people?
i
think
he
has
a
right
to
come
in
and
say
hey,
we're
going
to
put
you
to
work
today,
loading
that
automated
ship,
and
tomorrow
you're
going
to
strip
containers
--
or
do
whatever
we
have
to
do.
we've
retrained
some
of
the
people
so
they
can
be
high-low
drivers.
we've
taken
some
of
the
people
so
they
can
do
some
of
the
work
of
fixing
the
containers.
we
have
not
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes.
when
we
sat
down
and
we
negotiated
this
in
1968,
of
course,
we
had
a
strike;
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
appointed
a
special
mediator,
david
cole,
to
come
in.
and
we
sat
down,
and
we
argued
back
and
forth
what
was
best?
and
we
finally
come
to
the
conclusion,
with
the
help
of
david
cole,
that
in
the
port
area,
those
little
pieces
of
freight
that
normally
came
down
to
the
pier,
we
could
still
have
that.
outside
the
50-mile
radius,
we
did
not
want
to
impede
automation
therefore,
just
as
the
board
points
out
in
its
brief,
they
talk
about
a
container
coming
from
chicago
to
mayaguez.
that's
just
a
consolidated
container;
goes
right
through.
nobody
stops
it.
it's
only
those
pieces
of
cargo
that
are
coming
from
a
shipper
or
into
that
area
where
there
would
normally
flow
right
down
to
the
pier
as
it
always
did.
if
houff
prior
to
containerization
had
ten
cases
of
cargo
coming
from
out
in
west
virginia,
and
he
was
making
a
delivery,
he
wouldn't
take
it
down
and
strip
it
at
his
platform.
he'd
take
it
on
that
truck
and
bring
it
right
down
to
the
pier
where
the
longshoremen
would
handle
it,
and
take
it
off
and
put
it
on
pallets
or
put
it
in
slings
and
await
loading
on
the
ship.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
your
honor.
i
must
say
this
that
prior
to
containerization,
the
freight
forwarders,
that
was
the
consolidates;
they
only
done
the
paperwork.
they
would
make
arrangements
with
truckmen
to
go
pick
up
the
freight,
and
do
this
work.
and
i
think
on
page
8
of
our
brief,
in
a
footnote
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
no.
it
isn't.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
your
honor.
one
of
the
problems
that
we
have
is
that
some
of
the
steamship
companies
have
set
up
tariffs;
and
in
the
tariffs,
they
give
part
of
their
fees
to
the
consolidator
to
do
this
work.
in
other
words,
the
consolidator
gets
about
five
hundred
and
something
dollars
off
the
steamship
company
plus
a
part
of
the
revenue.
so
what
he's
really
doing
is
he
would
rather
have
it
done
outside
by
nonunion
labor.
he
has
a
fixed
cost,
and
this
is
the
way
they
operate.
and
the
problem
is,
it's
really
subcontracting
out
the
work.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
sure.
we
always
did
the
work.
consolidaters
never
--
steamship
companies
never
paid
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
your
honor,
i
may
say
this
that
i
don't
know
of
any
consolidation
that
was
ever
done
100
miles
away
from
the
port
prior
to
containerization.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
consolidation
really
years
ago,
i
think,
was
in
the
railroad
industry.
and
i
might
say
the
longshoremen
did
that
work
in
the
port
of
new
york,
too.
when
they
brought
down,
it
was
only
on
domestic
cargo
which
was
handled
by
railroads.
it
was
only,
as
i
said
on
page
8
that
we
have
a
footnote.
and
i
think
mr.
ullman
in
his
role
of
the
american
ocean
freight
forwarder
spells
out
that
when
they
were
going
out
of
business,
containerization
started
to
hurt
them;
they
had
to
get
into
a
new
business.
and
so
they
started
to
go
into
consolidation.
and
one
of
the
things
you
have
to
look
at
is
the
consolidator.
these
cases,
dolphin.
dolphin
didn't
have
his
own
employees.
he
went
out
and
made
a
deal
with
another
truckman
which
was
ila
people,
by
the
way,
an
ila
contract;
and
they
went
out,
and
they
made
a
deal
for
that
little
incidental
work
with
him
to
do
the
work.
he
never
did
the
work
before.
the
same
thing
with
--
i
would
gather
--
it
was
dolphin.
even
conex
started
out
that
way.
even
twin
started
out
that
way.
and
this
was
the
problems
that
we
had.
and
we
thought
that
we
had
the
problem
solved
in
1968.
and
as
pointed
out,
we
had
no
strike
in
1974
because
we
agreed
the
rules
were
there.
we're
not
going
to
change
them.
but,
again,
having
longshoremen
looking
and
saying
hey,
i'm
only
getting
the
one
day's
work
today.
i
don't
know
where
i'm
going
tomorrow
because
of
automation.
i
don't
know
how
you're
going
to
handle
this
problem.
and
i
certainly
think
it's
a
serious
problem
for
us
in
negotiations.
it
has
always
been.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
--
whose
containers?
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
whose
ever
they
are
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
only
those
containers
--
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
and
we
really
don't
even
want
--
taking
that
container
and
having
it
done
by
a
consolidator
because
we
find
that
there
is
so
much
-
so
many
practices.
illegal
practices
set
up.
so
you
take
dolphin.
dolphin
was
putting
on
the
bill
of
loadings
that
the
freight
was
coming
from
massachusetts.
and
of
course,
everybody
thought
it
was
coming
from
massachusetts
until
they
found
out
it
was
right
around
the
corner
from
the
pier.
and
the
same
with
the
other
company.
i
mean
--
this
is
--
and
even
conex,
in
the
conex
case.
it
was
a
disgrace.
they
were
paying
people
off.
to
get
their
containers
to
go
through
the
piers.
with
the
supervisors.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
basis
of
it.
mr.
thomas
w.
gleason,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
because
they
have
a
minimum
rate
for,
i
guess,
cargo
and
out.
from
what
i
understand
that
the
--
since
automation
come
in
that
the
nvo's,
as
they
call
them,
and
they
were
the
freight
forwarders
before.
they
came
in
and
they
could
add
or
decrease
the
cost
of
that
minimum,
depending
on
the
amount
of
service.
but
the
service,
again,
of
that
freight
forwarder
--
that
nvo
before
was
really
doing
the
paperwork;
and
so
therefore,
when
it
came
in,
in
order
to
get
the
freight,
the
steamship
company,
in
their
tariffs
--
it's
a
matter
of
record
--
is
really
giving
back
to
the
consolidator
--
i
think
it's
around
$500
roughly
plus
i
think
a
percentage.
now
one
of
the
arguments
has
been
in
negotiations
hey,
what
you
did
to
us,
you
tariffed
us
right
out
of
our
business.
you
know,
you're
getting
the
work
and
having
subcontractors
doing
the
work
by
putting
this
in
your
tariffs.
and
therefore,
causing
problems
because,
in
most
ports,
it's
based
on
the
manhours
that
goes
into
the
pension
and
welfare
funds.
now,
we
have
this
problem
in
new
york.
in
fact,
we
had
a
work
stoppage
in
19
--
i
think
it
was
1970
--
where
because
of
the
hours
generated
by
the
conventional
operators
was
going
into
the
fund,
and
the
automated
carriers,
especially
sea
land
--
they
were
the
only
ones
that
were
really
in
the
business
until,
i
think
1970;
'69;
'70.
their
hours
were
way
down.
yet,
the
tonnage
they
were
passing
through
the
port
was
tremendous.
and
so
finally,
they
got
around
in
new
york,
and
they
changed
to
a
tonnage
basis;
but
they
don't
do
this
in
hampton
roads,
and
they
don't
do
it
in
baltimore,
and
they
don't
do
it
in
norfolk.
and
we
see
ports
like
wilmington,
north
carolina,
where
they're
bringing
containers
in.
and
there's
no
work.
the
funds,
the
pension
funds,
the
welfare
funds
are
all
in
serious
trouble.
now,
if
they're
going
to
take
that
and
give
the
work,
that
little
work,
that's
going
to
give
it
to
consolidators
who
don't
own
any
equipment.
all
the
consolidator
has
is
a
pencil,
a
pad,
and
a
telephone.
he
has
nothing
else.
he
has
no
investment
in
this
industry.
carriers
put
all
the
money
in.
they're
the
ones
who
have
to
build
the
ships
and
put
the
equipment
in.
now,
what
we're
talking
about
is
something
that
accommodates
both
labor
and
management
so
that
we
do
have
progress
in
this
country.
