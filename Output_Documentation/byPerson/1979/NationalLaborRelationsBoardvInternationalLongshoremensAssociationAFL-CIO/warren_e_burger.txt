we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
national
labor
relations
board
against
international
longshoremen's
association.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
page
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
opinion,
mr.
wallace,
to
suggest
what
would
be
the
result
if,
in
relation
to
that
footnote,
the
ila
negotiated
a
contract
for
100
miles
on
the
next
negotiator?
in
other
words
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
get
some
hint
that
the
court
was
saying
50
miles
and
no
more.
is
that
enlarged
on
anywhere
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lips.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
technology
has
been
an
evolving
one,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
point
do
you
say
the
secondary
activity
begins
in
this
sequence
of
events?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
get
a
secondary
situation
from
something
written
on
a
piece
of
paper.
you
get
it
from
activity.
what
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lambos.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
this
does
not
intrude
on
this
new
technology?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
a
100-mile
limit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
a
matter
of
agreement.
you
say
we
agree
on
it;
that
would
be
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
you
get
the
facts
--
those
surely
are
factual
inquiries.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
surely
are
factual
inquiries.
what
is
the
common
law
of
the
industry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gleason.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
i
get
from
that
that
two
containers
which
would
be
precisely
the
same
dimensions,
perhaps
manufactured
by
the
same
manufacturer,
one
owned
by
one
party,
and
the
other
owned
by
a
different
party,
would
be
treated
differently
by
the
ila.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wanted
a
label
on
them
so
you
could
identify
which
ones
had
to
be
stripped.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
function
does
--
what
economic
function
does
the
stripping
of
this
one
container
perform?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
go
into
my
hypothetical.
two
containers
have
arrived
on
the
pier
and
are
absolutely
identical.
perhaps,
as
i
said,
made
in
the
same
factory.
one
is
owned
by
one
party
and
the
other
is
owned
by
another.
one
of
them
is
picked
up
by
a
hoist
and
put
on
the
vessel.
in
the
hold.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
other
one
--
what
would
you
do
with
the
other
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
hypothetical
question
i've
put
to
you,
mr.
gleason,
i
don't
know
whether
you
lost
me
or
i
lost
you.
but
let
me
try
again.
put
it
this
way.
what
is
the
purpose
of
putting
some
labels
on
containers
to
identify
the
ownership?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
do
you
do
as
a
result
of
seeing
a
particular
label
on
one?
the
ownership
--
it
belongs
to
a
consolidator
let
us
say.
what
happens
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
if
it
is
within
the
50-mile
radius.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
us
precisely.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
back
up.
you
see,
you
understand
this
thoroughly.
we
don't
necessarily
understand
it
as
well
as
you
do.
this
container
is
this
large
box
which
could
be
as
big
as
a
small
garage
sometimes,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
one-car
garage.
and
you
decide
this
is
one
that's
violated
the
50-mile
limit.
so
you
take
everything
out
of
that
container,
is
that
right?
when
you
say
strip
it,
you
take
the
things
out.
and
put
it
in
another
container
that
might
be
exactly
the
same
size
and
the
same
manufacturer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
having
moved
it
from
the
one
container
into
the
other,
you
pick
it
up
with
a
hoist
and
put
in
the
hold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
containers
now
being
used
on
cargo
airlines?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
container
system.
this
technology.
are
there
any
cases
where
they
pick
up
--
pick
things
up
off
the
ship?
take
the
container
off
the
ship
and
take
it
out
to
the
airport
and
load
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
parties
saw
to
it
that
the
container
which
is
used
on
the
airplane
was
also
used
in
the
hold
of
the
ship
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
airport
would
be
within
50
miles.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
gleason,
when
they
invented
the
automobile,
they
put
a
lot
of
horse
collar
manufacturers
out
of
business.
the
technology
is
at
work
here.
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
