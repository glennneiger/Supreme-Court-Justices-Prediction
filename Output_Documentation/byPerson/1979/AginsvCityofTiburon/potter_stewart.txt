justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
shute,
you're
simply
answering
the
questions
posed
to
you
by
members
of
the
court,
but
really,
aren't
all
these
things
matters
for
the
--
for
a
trial
court,
and
isn't
that
--
doesn't
that
show
why
a
demurrer
was
improper?
here,
you
have
a
complaint
that
in
paragraph
9
says
that
“the
natural
and
proximate
result
of
the
ordinance
was
to
prevent
any
sale,
use,
transfer
or
development
thereof,
or
any
part
thereof.”
and
then
you
filed
a
demurrer
which
i
assume
is
what
appears
on
page
25
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
demurrer
was
sustained
and
yet,
the
allegations
of
that
complaint
sound
like
the
property
was
taken
without
any
compensation
whatsoever.
now,
maybe
there
are
all
sorts
of
factual
evidence
that
can
show
that
it
wasn't,
but
why
--
why
does
this
make
a
demurrer
proper?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
--
you
weren't
referring
the
zoning
ordinances,
you
were
referring
to
all
sorts
of
other
permutations
and
combinations
and
possibilities.
all
of
those
things
are
matters
for
evidence
in
the
--
of
evidence
under
trial
court,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
that
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
is
--
is
factually
mistaken.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
constitution
imposed
a
very
strong
policy,
have
not
taken
anybody's
property
without
paying
for
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
if
a
zoning
ordinance
said
you
can
build
one
house
in
5
acres
of
real
estate,
in
the
center
of
manhattan
island
that
would
basically
be
a
taking,
because
everybody
knows
that's
economically
impossible.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
complaint
and
the
--
the
allegation
in
this
complaint
is
that
this
zoning
ordinance
is
equivalent
of
that,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
that
doesn't
require
evidence
to
find
out
if
it
is
or
isn't?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
would
concede
i
suppose,
if
the
city
of
tiburon
had
--
had
taken
this
property
and
just
moved
in
and
turned
it
into
a
public
park,
that
there
would've
been
an
action
for
a
so-called,
“inverse
condemnation”.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
concede
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
--
the
complaint
in
this
case
says
there
isn't
any
difference.
justice
potter
stewart
and
isn't
that
a
matter
then
for
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
the
zoning
ordinances
the
city
of
new
york
said,
if
you
own
--
said
to
an
owner
of
5
acres
of
unimproved
land,
you
can
build
exactly
one
residence
on
there,
in
the
middle
of
new
york.
and
he
filed
a
complaint
saying
this
zoning
ordinance
while
it
purports
to
simply
be
a
5-acre
residential
zoning
actually,
as
the
effect
of
taking
my
property,
because
i
can't
use
it
for
that
purpose
and
neither
--
and
i
can't
sell
it
for
that
purpose.
now,
would
that
be
a
good
a
--
a
complaint
to
which
a
demurrer
should
be
sustained?
